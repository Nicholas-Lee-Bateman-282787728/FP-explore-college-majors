269115,A9998RE3AEA95,6301801709,Alex,"[3, 5]","It took Earth two million years to cleanse itself from the results of a nuclear holocaust. Creatures of fantasy inhabit the Good Lands, while asenine mutants populate the areas which are still toxic. The lord of the mutants, deranged sorceror Blackwolf has long sought a means of motivating his docile hordes so, at last, they can overrun the Good Lands that his peaceful brother, Avatar, rules. By sheer luck, Blackwolf's legions unearth an old world relic, a bit of technology, enabling the mutant wizard to summon up the vanished concept of war. Now, Avatar must travel to the poisoned land of Scortch and confront his brother face to face, before Blackwolf's hordes of mutants and hell creatures completely destroy the elfin armies.By all means, Wizards is unique. It targets no specific audience, and the animation is of the same quality as newspaper cartoons (save the pretty backgrounds). Sequences are repeated all too frequently, and the colorized film cel images are more likely to aggravate than to impress (there are too many of them anyway). The voices are not synchronimzed with the characters. The plot is almost unbelievably rough and disjointed. You are likely to ask such questions as &quot;what is going on?&quot; and &quot;why is this happening now at all?&quot; If you are likely to watch Wizards at all, watch it a few times in consecution, so you can catch everything.Nevertheless, the film has its thought-provoking charm. The language used is bold to say the least, and some characters feature scanty clothing. The interplay of artful backgrounds, primitive, cartoony characters, and gory action proved to fascinate me. Maybe it's just me, but in its entirety, Wizards can make quite an impact. Even the seemingly antithetical ending begins to make sense after a while.

M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[0, 2]","This is one of those rare movies that doesn't try to hide its flaws, and actually benefits from them giving the entire movie a campy feel to it.  The accents are mixed up, the animation crude and often using recycled sequences, the movement is jerky, scenes are often using war footage that was animated over, and the jokes are often crude and dark natured.  But the film in a whole works.Though it is a bit preachy in its ways, this movie makes you interested in the characters.  It also brings up some intersting and satirical ideas.the world was destroyed in war, humans are few and most have mutated and live in badlands.  Elves, faeries and dwarves, have returned and taken over the good lands, but nothing seems different.  The factions are divided and uncooperative with each other.  When the badlands mutants gets a powerful leader, they ignore it until it is too late.  When the push is made for the mutants to take over the goodlands the enemy seemingly has too much up his sleeve.The cartoon has a definite seventies feel to it.  The humor is dark, twisted, and often times has a distinct feel of juxtoposition.  It is a fantasy futuristic world that has the attitude and feeling of New York.  There are fairy hookers, dirty streets with bums lying around, and bitter old men with brooklyn accents.  The evil army has a strong Nazi theme to it, as well as their secret weapons.It is also very violent, showing elves and fairies being killed by the hundreds, pow's being executed, and prisoners being forced to entertain soldiers any way they want.This is a very warped movie that shouldn't work, but does.

269124,A2W75RZ6WA9DCN,6301801709,"Banon ""IronMan004""","[0, 1]","Prior to Wizards, Ralph Bakshi had made very politically oriented adult animated films like Fritz the Cat, Coonskin, and Heavy Traffic. To prove that he could make a family film and something that didn&#8217;t necessarily rely on controversy to attract attention, he decided to make a fantasy film. It&#8217;s a Bakshi version of a family film, anyway. If you were to compare it to a Disney film of the time, or any of the Disney fantasy films, you&#8217;d notice some differences. Wizards is not as clean or polished as a film by Disney. Though a lot of this has to do with the considerable budget difference, it was just not his style to appear polished. For instance, throughout the film you can notice certain things such as recycled cels and a heavy use of stills. One of the more interesting aspects of this film that was a direct result of the low budget are the war scenes. These scenes are definitely the most visually striking in the film, as they display a mixture of cel and rotoscope animation of stock footage from World War II. Sort of. Honestly, I'm not really sure if what he does can actually be called using rotoscope. It's a strange juxtaposition of images that involves the animators coloring over live action footage as opposed to tracing it.Aside from the strange combination of animation styles, they're also brightly colored adding a distinct psychedelic feel to the war scenes. These scenes are still very interesting now because no one every used animation techniques like this before. It makes the battle scenes very chaotic and more reinforces the idea of war and violence than actually present a clear battle. Overall, Wizards is not a very pretty looking film and the animation has become dated, but There are some aspects of the art that still hold up well. For instance, the background art (especially for the land where Blackwolf rules) is incredibly detailed and bizarre looking, reminiscent of art in the underground comics of the 60s and 70s.The story is still fairly interesting as well whereas unlike a traditional fantasy which is set in an undefined past, this story takes place far in the future where the world has been utterly devastated by nuclear war. Much of the earth is covered with radiation and this spawns mutants and monsters. It also revives magical creatures like fairies, elves, dwarfs, and wizards. The film opens with nicely drawn stills and narration (by Susan Tyrrell) explaining the origins of the earth and the birth of two wizards: Avatar and Blackwolf. Avatar (Bob Holt) is good and Blackwolf (Steve Bravers) is evil. There's no explanation as to why they are the way they are, they were just born that way. They fight and Avatar wins. This causes Blackwolf to retreat to the irradiated badlands and enslave the mutants. He forces them to dig up old technology and put it together. They find guns and tanks but still can&#8217;t win against the forces of good. The mutants are too stupid and cowardly to effectively maintain fighting battles. Some 3000 years later, Blackwolf unearths a film projector and old Nazi propaganda footage. This becomes the ultimate weapon of the film.There are some really crazy scenes that show how effective the footage is during a battle. Blackwolf fills the sky with the footage which motivates his own forces (who are excited by the violence) and simultaneously terrifies the elves fighting them. These scenes are done with the footage being used instead of background animation and the cel animated characters in the foreground. It becomes a very clear battle between technology and magic. What's central to the film&#8217;s themes is that technology is something evil. It resulted in the destruction of the earth and it becomes even more obvious when it's directly and visually linked to Hitler. The villains use swastikas on their uniforms and flags and watch footage of Nazis with relish. There's something truly cynical about one of the only things to survive a planet-wide holocaust and thousands of years of radiation and ruin to be Hitler.The central plot becomes Avatar forming a party to journey to Blackwolf&#8217;s castle and destroy the propaganda machine and him. There are some interesting characters in the main cast. Avatar is an old wizard that has seen better days; much of his magic doesn&#8217;t work as well as it should and he acts like an aged hippie. Elinore (Jesse Welles) is his pupil, though they have a very flirtatious relationship. Weehawk (Richard Romanus) is a warrior elf chief. He&#8217;s actually a very tough and driven character, despite his appearance. The last member of the party is Necron 99, who becomes Peace (David Proval). He&#8217;s a robot assassin that agrees to escort them to Blackwolf&#8217;s lair. They run into all kinds of problems on their journey and there are some genuine surprises. The characters, Avatar and Weehawk in particular, are likeable and they have interesting designs. As with Fritz the Cat, the audio isn&#8217;t as strong as it should be. There are some instances of weak voice acting and the general sound quality isn&#8217;t terrific, though this again brings to mind the budget. Wizards may be Bakshi&#8217;s idea of a family film, but it's clearly geared towards an audience older than children. Death is very real and bloody in this film, and there's a very clear sense of danger around every corner. It does contain some elements of humor, but they tend to be very hit or miss.While Wizards is a (slightly messy) mix of different animation styles, it's still an engaging mix of sci-fi and fantasy, even today.",4,Bakshi's most accessible,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,5586,"['Prior', 'Wizards', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'had', 'made', 'very', 'politically', 'oriented', 'adult', 'animated', 'films',

(Technology bad,  nature good.)Nor does it help that the film goes from dead serious, to  blackly humorous, to just plain sophomoric and then back again.There is  a fair amount of gore, scantily clad females, and perverse situations to  offend many (in the best Bakshi tradition) but if you can get past that,  there are a lot of good images and techniques used to stretch out the  meager budget.

I never got the chance but recently bought the DVD on a whim and I have to say this is a odd little film.I can see why in the seventies this would be considered revolutionary.  There were several pokes at religion, politics, corporations and even the rising consumer culture.  At its heart the movie seems have a pacifist and anti technology message. At least those are the ideals put forward by the protagonist, named not so subtly Avatar.  That is until the very end, when the protagonist uses what he considered evil to accomplish his goals.The opening narration by Susan Tyrrell is splendid, although for some reason she is uncredited. I thought the rest of the film was unremarkable. The animation is poor by today's standards and the main characters are unlikeable.  Also there are curious sexual themes that I thought were out of place, especially in what Bakashi calls a kid's movie.

269130,A3E7ZFQNJ47XB7,6301801709,Brooser Bear,"[2, 3]","I would say that ninety percent of the fantasy stories today are either inspired by Ivanhoe or the Lord of the Rings. This one is a wonderful interpretation of the latter set to modern times. The main theme of the 'Rings was the Great War, or more appropriately, World War One, in which JRR Tolkien fought. Magic versus technology is another one of the issues that is rarely noticed by Tolkien's fans. Tolkien was born in South Africa in 1896, part of the DEAD GENERATION of England. It was called DEAD, because most of them died in the trenches of the Great War of 1914. Ironically this would have been the generation to see the transition from the world of horse and buggy to the world of Jet Propulsion and nuclear fission. Not only that, but Tolkien went to war with nine of his best friends that he grew up with; they all became lieutenants and none of them survived the war. Tolkien was an infantry officer, which meant that he would take a bunch of young soldiers, lose most of them in trench warfare, write a bunch of letters to their families, take another batch of fresh soldiers and do it again...When Tolkien came back, he married and became a popular professor of literature. He didn't go crazy or maladjusted like so many other veterans, instead he lived and died happily married with several children, who went on to fight in WWII. Lo and behold ,it turns out that he was working on a great epic in his spare time, which we came to know as the Rings Trilogy. Gee, I wonder if it kept him sane?Anyway, this film is a unique relic of its own. Even though it came out of the late seventies, its message is that of the late sixties and so is its likely audience (which first discovered the Lord of the Rings). The development in the area of computer graphics has made the surrealist animation techniques of this film obsolete, as was the fate of the surrealist art by the likes of Tangui and Maguerite.The strongest reason to see this is what probably amounts to the first music video, the psychodelic rendition of the German blitzkrieg footage combined with the loss of innocence, set to music, an army of animated elves with shields and swords getting blown away in the literal sense by tanks and field artillery. That sequence alone compelled me to get this tape now, all those years later so that I can that see again that old war footage given psychodelic dimension with splashes of color and hear the haunting music behind it.

269132,A3KA6CG7VG4JAK,6301801709,Buzz1954,"[0, 0]","Written & Directed by Ralph BakshiQuote:In a post apocalyptic future that appears as a blend of World War II Europe and J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, a pint-size wizard named Avatar must save the world from a band of fascist mutants controlled by his evil twin brother, Blackwolf, who likes to confuse enemy armies by projecting films of Adolf Hitler speeches during attacks. Painted live-action footage of advancing Nazi armies contrasts with Saturday-morning-cartoon-style animation of fairies and elves as Avatar travels through various magical and radioactive realms on his quest. Aiding him are the beautiful Fairy princess Elinore, hot-blooded warrior elf Weehawk, and Peace, a misunderstood robot rebelling against his Blackwolf-controlled programming. A bizarre and psychedelic meditation on magic vs. technology, this ultimate futuristic fantastic epic cult film still finds an audience on college campuses and will prove quite rewarding to viewers in the right frame of mind.A Few thoughts of my own here:1. This movie is definitely NOT for anyone under 18. There is considerable violence & bloodshed, even for an animated movie. It is not quite as graphic as a movie like Heavy Metal, but in addition to the violence, & sexual talk & situations, (though subtle), & there are a few, (but not many), curse words used throughout this movie.Now, I tell you this NOT to drive you away from this movie, (which I think is excellent), but simply to inform you as to what to expect. It is a movie about a war after all.2. The plot summary that I have given you here is very good in summing up this movie, but I cannot totally agree with this statement:Quote:Saturday-morning-cartoon-style animationSaturday morning animation was never like this.The characters are more surreal than the classic animation of Saturday morning cartoons. The characters, (especially Elinor), are more ""sensual looking"" than in standard cartoon animation. The whole setting of WIZARDS is very surreal, incorporating ink & pen animation, Rotoscoping, charcoal & pencil artworks, as well as historical footage from World War 2.And yet despite all these different styles of animation-it is the story line & characterizations that really drive WIZARDS.The character of the good wizard Avatar, voiced brilliantly by Bob Holt, (Dinky Dalton & Grape Ape from Laff-a-Lympics, Mr. Sea Worthy from the Snorks, & Homer Zukkerman from 1973's Charlotte's Web movie), is initially seen as somewhat of a bumbling wizard, who really doesn't seem very powerful. He does have a good heart though, but really feels his age, (well over 3,000 years), & only reluctantly realizes that he must face his brother Blackwolf once & for allElinor is voiced by actress Jesse Welles, who while she doesn't have many voice credits, does a wonderful job of portraying the buxom, fairy-in-training. She does seem to be a little flighty, but is quite determined to avenge her father's death at the hands of one of Blackwolf's assassins. She is not afraid to use her ""sensuousness"" to get what she wants, & sometimes acts without thinking, which proves to be almost disastrous at times.The elf Weehawk, voiced by Richard Romanus, is a true warrior, who feels that fighting is the only way to accomplish anything. He is hot-headed & impulsive, & ready to jump into battle at a moments notice. He sometimes has to be ""reigned-in"" by Avatar. Like Jesse Welles, Richard does not have many voice credits to his name, but gives a dynamic performance as the hot-headed Weehawk.Steve Gravers, who voices Avatar's evil brother Blackwolf, is another actor, who like Jesse & Richard, does not have many voice credits to his name, but that doesn't stop him from a driving & dynamic performance as the deliciously evil wizard. His performance as the single-minded Blackwolf is wonderful to watch. Totally ruthless, he will do whatever it takes to claim the good lands to escape his own radiation scarred homeland.David Proval is another actor, who doesn't have that many voice credits, but, (with the few lines that he does have), does a very convincing job as the Blackwolf driven robot assassin Nekron99, renamed Peace by Avatar, who is the one who kills Elinor's father. After Avatar has a little ""talk"" to Peace, (under the threat of torture if he doesn't guide the small company of Elinor, Weehawk, & himself), we begin to see that Peace really does want to be free of Blackwolf's influence. We can hear that in his voice.Three other things to mention:Although it is a small part, actor Mark Hamill, (Star Wars), portrays a mountain fairy named Shawn, who offers to guide Avatar & company.Also, the music chosen for WIZARDS, is is almost surreal in its sound. In particular, there is a song sung by the character of Elinor, (& sung by either actress Susan Anton or Jesse Welles-I can't find a definitive answer. IMDB lists it as being sung by Anton), called ""Only Time Will Tell"". It is a wonderfully haunting melody, that adds to the surreal feel of the movie.Susan Tyrell, who was WIZARD'S narrator, recently died on 6/17/12. It was her voice, which tied the whole movie together.This is a movie that is very polarized in the classic battle between good & evil. You ""feel"" for the good characters. It is an emotion-driven film that, while it is not everyone's ""cup-of-tea"", IS a must-see for all animation fans.",4,A driving battle between Good & Evil!,1341792000,"07 9,

Chow,"[0, 0]","I've never been a fan of Ralph Bakshi but here he presents an original idea so silly it works.Every once and a while a truly bizarre film is made, so bizarre it works. `Ghostbusters' `Donnie Darko' `Blue Velvet.' These films are proof that silly ideas can workout.Here we are in a fantasyland with dragons knights and yes wizards.

I thought this because somewhere in the distant recesses of my mind I sorta kinda remembered that Ralf Bakshi was associated with Spider-man cartoon and Lord of the Rings... it was after viewing this movie that I remembered why I hate Ralf Bakshi animation.He just doesn't care.He fell back on reusing animation over and over and over again and also used rotoscoping.  Which, unfortunately, I remembered the last part of the Spider-man series ending so horribly.  The same went for Lord of the Rings, it was quite obvious that he used rotoscoping in that as well.This brings me back to Wizards.  Not only was this just plain awful, with no plot, dialogue, or any kind of redeeming graces.  It was just plain stupid.  Initially, when I first bought the film, I thought it was just because I was too young to understand it fully and that there was some kind of deeper meaning to the film that I just did not get.Well, I can safely tell you as a worldly adult that it truly sucked.  It was so bad it made my head hurt.  Truly, I don't even think that MST3k could save this one.The best use of this DVD is as a coffee coaster.

269137,A3N95R1VKWROWF,6301801709,Christopher Schwinger,"[2, 14]","I'm a little bit of a fantasy lover--not a big one, but I like the imagination inherent in the fantasy genre.  I saw the video of this for $1 somewhere and was misled by its description.  It sounded like it was a somewhat sophisticated and Star Wars-like fantasy.  Instead, it is a thinly developed story, filled with rude cussing, blood splatters, stupid writing, and persistent gloom.  The reason I thought it would be worthwhile was because I mostly liked what Ralph Bakshi did with his animated Lord of the Rings movie.  This, on the other hand, is definitely the trashiest animated movie I've watched.  He only did well on Lord of the Rings because the story was already there, or he'd have trashed that too, I'm convinced.  The only reason I watched through this instead of quitting after 10 minutes was because I wanted to understand how such a poor movie could continue for over an hour.  It boggles my mind that this movie was even made.  Thankfully it wasn't two hours--but being a little over an hour, it still felt very long to put up with.  The animation is dreary, and there is no sophistication in the story.  The climax was disappointing in that it's a simple rude confrontation between the ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" (though the good guy isn't that lovable, in my opinion) that leads to the good guy shooting the bad guy.  It seemed to me that the movie was intentionally nasty and venting anger about the horrors of violence, and I was also very offended by a short scene blaspheming Yahweh and Jesus (Judaism and Christianity).So learn from my mistake - it may seem like a creative twist on the fantasy genre, but it's garbage.  Wanton and gratuitous language and violence, dreary animation, blasphemous mockery of Judaism and Christianity, and a poorly developed story.",1,Total trash,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,1787,"[""'m"", 'little', 'bit', 'fantasy', 'lover', 'not', 'big', 'one', 'like', 'imagination', 'inherent', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'saw', 'video', '1', 'somewhere', 'was', 'misled', 'description', 'sounded', 'was', 'somewhat', 'sophisticated', 'Star', 'Wars-like', 'fantasy', 'Instead', 'thinly', 'developed', 'story', 'filled', 'rude', 'cussing', 'blood', 'splatters', 'stupid', 'writing', 'persistent', 'gloom', 'reason', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'was', 'mostly', 'liked', 'what', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'did', 'animated', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'definitely', 'trashiest', 'animated', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'only', 'did', 'well', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'story', 'was', 'already', 'there', ""'d"", 'have', 'trashed', 'too', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'only', 'reason', 'watched', 'instead', 'quitting', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'wanted', 'understand', 'how', 'such', 'poor', 'movie', 'could', 'continue', 'hour', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'Thankfully', 'was', ""n't"", 'two', 'hours', 'being', 'little', 'hour', 'still', 'felt', 'very', 'long', 'put', 'up', 'animation', 'dreary', 'sophistication', 'story', 'climax', 'was', 'disappointing', 'simple', 'rude', 'confrontation', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', ""n't"", 'lovable', 'opinion', 'good', 'guy', 'shooting', 'bad', 'guy', 'seemed', 'movie', 'was', 'intentionally', 'nasty', 'venting', 'anger', 'horrors', 'violence', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'offended', 'short', 'scene', 'blaspheming', 'Yahweh', 'Jesus', 'Judaism', 'Christianity', '.So', 'learn', 'mistake', 'may', 'seem', 'creative', 'twist', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'garbage', 'Wanton', 'gratuitous', 'language', 'violence', 'dreary', 'animation', 'blasphemous', 'mockery', 'Judaism', 'Christianity', 'poorly', 'developed', 'story']",Wizards VHS

269140,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6301801709,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[124, 130]","Wizards (1977) aka War Wizards (the name was changed at the behest of George Lucas as he thought two movies released at the same time by the same studio with war in the title, his being Star Wars, would have been off-putting to movie goers) written and directed by Ralph Bakshi, was certainly a departure from some of his previous adult animation works, Fritz the Cat (1972) and Heavy Traffic (1973), but provided Bakshi the opportunity to show he could create a animated feature for all viewers, young and old, that spoke to the viewer on intelligent terms.  Were all viewers ready to hear what he had to say?  No, and given the subsequent release of Star Wars (like two weeks later) Wizards, which had been enjoying a great amount of success, got pushed out of theaters to allow for space for George Lucas' epic space opera.  With this release of Wizards on DVD, maybe now his film will garner the recognition it deserved so long ago.The story goes that the Earth gets consumed in apocalyptic fire as man unleashes his most terrible achievement upon himself, and many years after his destruction, various forms of life begin to come forth, including fairies, elves, pixies along with mutants, beings once humans but changed over thousands of years of exposure to radiation.  Almost all technology is gone, wiped from the face of the Earth, and, in its' place, magic has prospered.  Born of the same mother are two brothers who become powerful wizards, one good, Avatar, and the other evil, Blackwolf.  After a tremendous battle, Avatar vanquishes Blackwolf, but not before Blackwolf issues a statement that indicates he will not go quietly into that good night.Blackwolf, now residing in the poisoned lands with the mutants and nasty things, puts together a massive army, but one lacking proper motivation, and, subsequently, they are easily defeated any time they are sent forth into battle.  Tired of his inability to advance proper on his enemies and gain ground, Blackwolf commands that his followers dig up once forgotten technology, hoping to find aid within the scattered remnants of the powerful technology of old.  His salvation comes in the form of propaganda films created by the Germans during WWII.  Likening himself to the leader of the German forces during this past conflict, Blackwolf uses the films to not only motivate his troops, but to instill fear and dread among his enemies, showing the films in the sky during the battles.This prompts Avatar, his female fairy charge Elinore, the leader of the Elves named Weehawk, and Blackwolf's captured/converted assassin robot re-named peace, to embark on an adventure to discover the source of Blackwolf's new power, and destroy it.  Can this heroic group effectively end Blackwolf's reign of terror and end his powerful war machine before all is lost?  There's a nice bit of irony at the end, one that really suited the feature.So, is the film any good?  I have read many opinions that will tell you it's not, and I can understand why this film would put some off, but I really enjoyed the movie.  Bakshi's goal, as I understood it, was to create an animated feature with heart, one that didn't talk down to its' audience, as do other animated features released by other companies, i.e. Disney, do at times.  His animation style definitely unconventional, is certainly distinctive, and swims with realism, despite the surface superficialities.  I really loved how he incorporated live action footage into the film, enveloping it with animation, creating an eerie superimposed background to various scenes within the movie.  The film was rated PG at the time of it's release, so I would be wary of showing it to younger viewers, but I think it's a really wonderful alternative full of heart to the shiny, happy, uber-clean, product tie-in animation put out by the larger profit-driven studios.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to make a profit, certainly, but sometimes it seems like these films tend to cater to the lowest common denominator, and be more contrived to make money rather than entertain.  The animation may seem crude, disturbing, and misogynistic at times, but this is animation with the sugar coating peeled away, mirroring elements within our society.  Do people want to see this in an animated feature?  Maybe not, but I enjoyed it, but may find myself hard presses to recommend it to all but the more discriminating viewer.The picture looks really good here in wide screen anamorphic, and there are some wonderful special features including a commentary track by writer/director Ralph Bakshi, theatrical trailers and TV spots for the film, a still gallery with conceptual drawings, and a featurette titled `Ralph Bakshi:  The Wizard of Animation'.  This provides a wonderful look into the making of Wizards, and Bakshi also provides tons of background on himself, how he got started, his difficulties and successes within the animation business, his motivations for his films, his contempt for animation that talks down to audiences, and his experiences with various individuals during his career.  This is the only featuette he's doing for any of his releases, mainly due to his affinity for the project.  Some of his comments, especially the ones hinting towards various conspiracies leveled at him, make him sound a little nutty, but make for entertaining viewing.  All in all, an excellent release of a great little animated film that went against the conventional grain.  Also, keep an ear out for a voice appearance by Mark Hamill as Sean, king of the fairies.Cookieman108",4,&quot;They've killed Fritz!&quot;,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,5567,"['Wizards', '1977', 'aka',

That is dead on. The animation is both bad and wonderful. The plot is epic, wonderful and poorly thought out and petty.So, here are some random thoughts:The animation -I LOVE the fact that Bakshi used a variety of animation styles and techniques. It made the movie visually interesting and some of it is great enough to rival Disney at his best.Sometimes, however, the animation is of such poor quality that it distracts from the action. At times, the animation is worse than ""SeaLab 2021"" on ""Adult Swim"" - and they intentionally make the animation bad!The characters and plot:Well, you clearly have good guys and bad guys. However, you have muddled motivation for the mutant bad guys (led by the evil wizard Blackwolf) to attack the good guys. At first, it seems like they're attacking because they are envious of the prosperity of the good humans and their allies, the elves and fairies. Then, about halfway through, we find out the mutants are forced to live in irradiated territories that the good  wizard (Avatar) never quite got around to cleaning up with his good magic (even though he comments that he could easily do it). Why didn't he? Well, apparantly, he's too concerned with drinking scotch and lusting over his young, lusty, busty apprentice.This throws the whole plot into a twist - are the bad guys really evil mutants? Or, are they victims of repression on the part of the non-mutants. If that is the case, than what is Bakshi trying to say by having the mutants being whipped up by Nazi propoganda movies? Is he trying to excuse the Nazis by making a parrallel with the Peace of Versailles and the terrible terms imposed on the Germans that led to the rise of the Nazis?No, I think he's just got a really, really sloppy script, as evidenced by the fact that half of the lines of his lead elf character (soon to be king) are incoherent battle screams - even when they're not appropriate. He must be a hoot at the dinner table!And I wonder, why do Nazi propoganda movies turn on non-German-speaking mutants and inspire them to fight? They can't understand Hitler - they just get excited by the pictures, I guess. Was Bakshi trying to say that cinematic violennce inspires more violence? That is an interesting seniment, considering the amount of blood spilled in the movie.Once again, I don't think he was trying to say anything, I think he was just sloppy.One more thought: was it just me - or were some of the battle scenes from this movie spliced into Bakshi's version of ""the Lord of the Rings?""",2,My opinion is all over the place with this movie,1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,2632,"['reviewer', 'described', 'accurately', 'when', 'said', 'was', 'weird', 'horrible', 'funny', 'enthralling', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'dead', 'animation', 'bad', 'wonderful', 'plot', 'epic', 'wonderful', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'petty.So', 'here', 'are', 'random', 'thoughts', 'animation', '-I', 'LOVE', 'fact', 'Bakshi', 'used', 'variety', 'animation', 'styles', 'techniques', 'made', 'movie', 'visually', 'interesting', 'great', 'enough', 'rival', 'Disney', 'best.Sometimes', 'however', 'animation', 'such', 'poor', 'quality', 'action', 'times', 'animation', 'worse', 'SeaLab', '2021', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'intentionally', 'make', 'animation', 'bad', 'characters', 'plot', 'Well', 'clearly', 'have', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'However', 'have', 'muddled', 'motivation', 'mutant', 'bad', 'guys', 'led', 'evil', 'wizard', 'Blackwolf', 'attack', 'good', 'guys', 'first', ""'re"", 'attacking', 'are', 'envious', 'prosperity', 'good', 'humans', 'allies', 'elves', 'fairies', 'Then', 'halfway', 'find', 'out', 'mutants', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'irradiated', 'territories', 'good', 'wizard', 'Avatar', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'cleaning', 'up', 'good', 'magic', 'even', 'comments', 'could', 'easily', 'do', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Well', 'apparantly', 'too', 'concerned', 'drinking', 'scotch', 'lusting', 'young', 'lusty', 'busty', 'apprentice.This', 'whole', 'plot', 'twist', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'really', 'evil', 'mutants', 'are', 'victims', 'repression', 'part', 'non-mutants', 'case', 'what', 'Bakshi', 'trying', 'say', 'having', 'mutants', 'being', 'whipped', 'up', 'Nazi', 'propoganda', 'movies', 'trying', 'excuse', 'Nazis', 'making', 'parrallel', 'Peace', 'Versailles', 'terrible', 'terms', 'imposed', 'Germans', 'led', 'rise', 'Nazis', 'No', 'think', 'just', 'got', 'really', 'really', 'sloppy', 'script', 'evidenced', 'fact', 'half', 'lines', 'lead', 'elf', 'character', 'soon', 'be', 'king', 'are', 'incoherent', 'battle', 'screams', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'appropriate', 'must', 'be', 'hoot', 'dinner', 'table', 'wonder', 'why', 'do', 'Nazi', 'propoganda', 'movies', 'turn', 'non-German-speaking', 'mutants', 'inspire', 'fight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Hitler', 'just', 'get', 'excited', 'pictures', 'guess', 'Was', 'Bakshi', 'trying', 'say', 'cinematic', 'violennce', 'inspires', 'more', 'violence', 'interesting', 'seniment', 'considering', 'amount', 'blood', 'spilled', 'movie.Once', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'anything', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'sloppy.One', 'more', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'were', 'battle', 'movie', 'spliced', 'Bakshi', 'version', 'Lord', 'Rings']",Wizards VHS

Saw this on its original release, well-toasted (as was the entire audience, come to think of it), but it's that years-later second viewing that really hammers home how awful WIZARDS truly is. A long narrated still-frame introduction prepares you for one sort of movie - as soon as the animation begins, we get another one entirely. It appears to be a crude retelling of WW2 recast in a ridiculous standoff of ""magic vs technology"" - of course the good guys, led by a lame wizard who might've resulted had Robert Crumb storyboarded the COLUMBO series, represent ""magic"". The Secret Weapon of the bad guys which provides all the dramatic conflict (by paralyzing the forces of Niceness into immobility during battle) turns out to be Super-8 movies of Hitler; these mixed-media segments play more like mixed-up media. By the time the ridiculously overdramatic narrator returns to wrap it up with, ""At last, Hitler was dead, again..."", only the very very dim could fail to Get It (and a note here to all elf-lovin' fantasy nerds: I know you hate having to face up to this, bu-u-ut....Hitler's ""technology"" was defeated not by ""magic"" and ""nature"" but by our own ""technology"": mellow-harshing buzz-killers like bullets, tanks, planes, incendiaries, the splitting of the atom, etc. Weren't very many giggling lapdancers in dental-floss lingerie at Normandy Beach, to say nothing of stogie-chewing elves, Churchill notwithstanding.) This puerility of vision - ZAP Comics trying but never actually meeting Tolkien - is dreary enough, but the animation makes it more painful still. The rotoscoping is inferior to what the Fleischers had achieved a generation earlier, and its willy-nilly insertion into the 'regular' animated segments, which resemble Nelvana on a bad day, is jarringly amateurish. There are a few saving moments of humor here (""They killed Fritz!""), but they too seem out of place. MEAN STREETS fans might want to check it out, though, as two of the voices are provided by that movie's Richard Romanus & David Proval. Too bad y'can't mute the PICTURE in this case, though.

269156,AWI3PQ13KX0WE,6301801709,"Eric Noble ""Animation Keeper""","[0, 1]","After completing three urban/adult animated films, Ralph Bakshi wanted to branch out and do something that he had never done before: a family film. he shifted his focus from the seedy underbelly of modern New York to Tolkienesque fantasy realms. Wizards is the film that sprang forth from Bakshi's mind.The world the film is set in is thousands or millions of years in the future, as the world recovers from a nuclear holocaust. There are a re two main areas on earth now. Skorch, the badlands, is a radiated wasteland filled with mutants and orc-like creatures. Then, there is Montagar, a land where the land has healed and where sprang fairies, elves, and other magical creatures.The story concerns two brothers, Avatar and Blackwolf. The brothers are diametrically opposite of each other. Avatar is good and kind, while Blackwolf is evil with a thirst for power. As each of Blackwolf's attempts to conquer Montagar fails, he digs up ancient Nazi propaganda to inspire his mutant army, which it does very successfully. To combat this, Avatar, his elf-warrior Weehawk, his pupil/love interest Princess Elinore, and a former robot assassin named Peace go off to Skorch to destroy the projector that plays the inspiring propaganda.Okay, this film is a step down from Bakshi's earlier films. I think the main reason for this is because Bakshi was in a new element. His previous films were urban and modern, whereas the fantasy worlds of Montagar and Skorch require a different approach. Bakshi is not very successful in that respect. The dialogue in the film shifts from modern urban talk to Tolkienesque vernacular often within the same scene. There is not a good balance between the modern and the fantastic. Avatar is supposed to be a great wizard, but he talks like Peter Falk, wheras Weehawk sounds like he just came out of The Hobbit. Elinore falls somewhere in-between.Secondly, the story is a bit of a mess. We have the basic element of the two warring brothers, but it's the other elements added in that drag it down. Would old Nazi propaganda or other materials and relics of the 20th century survive that long into the future, especially after a nuclear holocaust? That's kind of hard to buy, but if you're in the right mod, you can overlook it. Added on to that, Ralph tries to fit in a lot of ideas and themes in the film, but he doesn't know how to make them mesh well. He tries to fit religious (especially Jewish) imagery, somehow trying to make a statement on the plight of Jews or something, but it all adds up to nothing. He tries to make the film an anti-overreliance on technology, but that gain is muddled and not handled well. There's no establishment for the conflict between science and magic. Next, there are scenes and lot elements that don't add up. Peace disappears from the film for about 10-15 minutes, but we're never told or shown what happened during that time.However, despite these shortcomings, the film does have strong aspects to it. The artwork in the film is wonderful, with fantastic backgrounds for Skorch provided by British illustrator Ian Miller. The backgrounds are nice and detailed, as contrasted with the natural, organic feel of the backgrounds of Montagar. Also, the animation is pretty good, despite some moments of weakness and lack of pencil testing or planning. Also, Bakshi had comic-book artist Mike Ploog draw some history scenes, where there was no animation, but still images explaining the backstory. They work beautifully and feel just right, meaning they fit in the film. The music also serves the film well, quietly underscoring the action without distracting us from it.The film's greatest strength are the battle scenes. It beautifully mixes cel-animation and rotoscope. Bakshi takes stock footage to his advantage. Painting over the stock footage gave the battle scenes an otherworldly feeling. The soldiers looked dark and menacing, which gives it just the right feeling. Besides that, the battles are wonderfully staged and choreographed, and it gives the feeling that Bakshi is paying homage to the great fantasy illustrators, such as his good friend Frank Frazetta.

This came out the same year as Star Wars and when you are 15, it is the coolest movie you have seen.  Now that I am umm... older, this movie still rocks.  I show this movie to some friends of mine who didn't grow up during that time frame.  We were all adults watching it and they loved it so much that they decided to add it to their DVD collection.  Now I must say, most women don't get why us guys like this movie.  I can't really get all the reasons, why I like this movie, I just do.  Perhaps its the character of Avatar, or Peace, maybe its the ending or the cool music during the battle scene.  It is just a fricking cool, kind of counter-culture movie.  Nowadays much better animated features exist and there are some fantastic movies, but THIS one is special to me.  The story is about 2 brothers, both Wizards, one good, one bad, but the good one is kinda rough around the edges.  He smokes, he curses (or what was allowed back then) and a bit fed up.  He is called upon once again to try to stop evil from spreading throughout the world. His brother, hates where he live and wonder why they have to live in the wasteland so he wants a piece of the good land... and so we have a collision course set.  Along the way, Avatar (the good wizard) encounters other fantastical creatures and it adds to the character of the movie.Ralph Bakshi may not be the world best animated, but he made some pretty cool animation.  Besides you have to have something other than Disney and back then, Bakshi was the answer.  His themes always seem to be more adult and his characters are flawed, but that what makes the movies (like Wizard), so cool.  It's different and its a good different.  For you new people, the animation may look a little dated, but I think, if you get behind the story, you will enjoy it.  And I was going to give it 4 out of 5 stars, but 4 rates as ""like it"" and 5 rates as love it.  I love this movie, so my rating is based on how well I dig this film.

Also full length animated features were not respected by the film academy and weren't expected to have a complex storyline or plot.  Until Bakshi arrived only Disney produced full length animated features with success.  Bakshi produced at first adult only heavy graphic animated art (Fritz the Cat).  But his genius and wonderful animation and storylines had a following and very interested audience.  Bakshi Animators were allowed to create the story with much latitude and individual style not like Disney's cramped cookie cutter style of the 70's.Now came ""WIZARDS"" Raplh Bakshi's favorite film from his pallet of creativity.  This 35th Anniversary Blu-ray Book Edition now more than ever shows the artistic marvel ""WIZARDS"" really was/is.  We can now enjoy completely and appreciate Bakshi's passion and genius.This 35th Anniversay Blu-ray Book Edition provides us with Bakshi's full disclosure of this and all his creative genius art work.  This man Writes, Directs, Draws and Produces.  He has complete control of his product. Just like George Lucas did with Star Wars except Bakshi did not believe in merchandising his creative world. (Note: Both these young genius' worked for FOX and released amazing films in 1977.  We all know who became the household name!!  But Bakshi genius is preserved forever in this Blu-ray Disc!!!!!!!!)  So WIZARDS is a story of two brothers one good the other is evil or in Bakshi's world Imagination and Magic versus Technology and Machinery. The genius is the animation is inaccordance with the brothers amazing stuff!!!This is a must have Edition to our Blu-ray Fantasy library!!!!!!!  This ""WIZARDS (1977)"" set includes; a 24 page illustrated/antimated hard cover book.  1 Blu-ray Disc - 81 minute movie in Blu-ray (PURE EYE CANDY), the SPECIAL FEATURES include; COMMENTARY by Director Ralph Bakshi (his commentary is one of the best, most candid and informative I've ever listened to!!!  Bakshi is a very entertaining and interesting character.) Also, ""RAPLH BAKSHI"": The Wizard of Animation (30 minutes of animation/animator history WODERFUL STUFF), a Still Gallery and Theatrical Trailers.This is a must have movie!!!  Also a special note;  Bakshi Loved Tolkien so much that after ""WIZARDS"" he went to see Tolkiens daughter for permission to make an animated version of ""THE LORD of the RINGS"".  With her full endorsement went ahead and made the first half (released in 1978)  Also available in Blu-ray!!!

The story of an nuclear apocolypse ravaged world that has recreated the earth from society as we know it today into a fantasy/future world.  Those who do not serve technology are assured death.  Brothers Blackwolf and Avatar stand on opposing sides.  Avatar is a wizard of peace while his brother Blackwolf yerns for domination.  Blackwolf devises the ultimate plan to control society by finding and using old relics from a dark period in 20th century history.  Need I mention it?With great animation coupled with old grainy film, this film is definately a rarity of adult-oriented animated cinema by Ralph Bakshi, director and creator of ""Fritz The Cat"" and ""Coonskin"".  Bakshi's work stirred controversy long before Toshio Maeda shook up the anime world with the cult-classic ""Urotsukidoji"" and ""La Blue Girl"" stories.Wizards, while definately not for kids, makes for a great replacement for Bakshi good but unfinished adaptation of ""The Lord Of The Rings"".

I saw this movie in 1999 and was absolutely floored by the realism of the characters movements.  I think American Pop is one of the greatest stories and animated features ever made.  The characters were very vivid and the animation using rotoscoping was sick, in a good way!I picked up Wizards as this week I decided to up my animation collection and pick up ALL of Bakshi's titles.  Wizards arrived to me yesterday along with Issac Azimov's Light Years and I popped it in right away.  The beginning had me captured as I saw traces of live action mixed with animation which Bakshi is known for, but the rest of the movie, minus the cool rotoscoping scenes, didn't really do it for me.  The story was pretty bad and it seems the story boards were thrown in to an already short movie cause Bakshi and his team were too lazy to complete the animation.It is absolutely worth a watch if you are a true Bakshi fan and want to see his first attempts at Rotoscoping which were great and impactful.

269165,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,6301801709,Green Manalishi,"[1, 1]","It may be of more interest to animators than those seeking real entertainment.  This is a pretty boring movie.  The simplistic plot:  Avatar, the good guy wizard with a New York accent and Garfield drawl must put a stop to his evil twin brother, Blackwolf, who has summoned the forces of technology and the Nazi war machine to take control of the world.  This movie goes on and on.  I appreciated some of the animation, kind of a mixture of Fritz the Cat and The Lord of the Rings, Heavy Metal and the Smurfs.  But the characters are very flat and generate very little genuine interest, same goes for the simplistic storyline.  A much better movie was Rankin and Bass' 1977 'The Hobbit', or 'The Last Unicorn'.  I wasn't a great big fan of Heavy Metal and I've still only seen parts of Fritz, but if you didn't care for either of those you'll get more of the same here.  If you did like those, then maybe this will be your cup of tea.  It's a period piece, granted, but for a real 5 star animation purchase, I would go with Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away' or 'Princess Mononoke', both of which can be watched multiple times with new satisfaction and appreciation gained from repeat viewings.  Granted they are post turn of the millenium whereas Wizards is midnight movies era (1978).  But I can't imagine anyone sitting through Wizards more than once, and to be honest it is something of a feat to make it all the way through once.  This is no 5-star picture.  It's not even a 4-star picture.  Don't be fooled by the hype on this site - like I was when I bought this DVD!About the best thing this DVD has going for it is the Featurette with Bakshi discussing his work, so you get to see the man behind the cartoon and listen to his ideas, some of which are fascinating, some of which seem somewhat deluded.  Bakshi calls this his 'children's film'.  Come on!  How many children's pictures have you seen that feature nipple-protruding buxom maidens in skimpy outfits running around with debauched old wizards?  I gotta say, I liked the artistic style of the work in this movie, whether or not it's a 'kid's movie' - my biggest problem was that, in spite of the hip 'street vibe' that comes through from time to time, and the cool dark artistry of the background scenery - the story just plain sucks.  I will say, when Bakshi himself explains the story in a nutshell during his interview, it sounds slightly more interesting than sitting through the 80 minute reality that is this movie.  Also, regarding the plot, I think what may be clear in Bakshi's mind in terms of what the story is, didn't come off as clearly as what the movie gave us - and even if it had, it wouldn't have been much better.  The story is too simplistic.  I doubt kids would get into it even if their parents let 'em watch it (although that fairy maiden IS hard to keep your eyes off).  Bakshi claims he wanted to give animation viewers a chance to see 'real' characters - so he adds the element of New York street talk to cartoon fantasy.  That's real?  Actually, that's the Bakshee trademark and is a brand unto itself.  I can respect that.  If only the story wasn't so boring.  This is mid-night movie fodder - perhaps one needs to be loaded and at the movies - big screen - and with a bunch of other freaks to really enjoy this.The Bakshi featurette is the most interesting thing here.

What was 20th Century Fox's very first full-length animated motion picture, Wizards proved to be a success in its own time, and a cult classic for decades to come.Set in a post-apocalyptic Earth, humanity was killed off because of a nuclear war. The eldritch races then come out of hiding, including elves, fairies, and dwarves. During this revival of magic, two brother wizards fued over the control of power. The evil wizard Blackwolf takes over the land of Scortch where goblins and mutants dwell, while his peaceful brother Avatar protects the fairy realm of Montagar. Blackwolf plans to take over Montagar by sending robot assassins out to kill of its leaders. The robot Necron 99 terminates the fairy president, but is taken out by Avatar, who reprograms it to be ""Peace"", a reformed robot to lead them through to Scortch. Along on their quest comes the elf ranger Weehawk and the boobalicious fairy princess Elinore. Blackwolf has in turn dug up some old Nazi propaganda movies to motivate his troops and stun the opposing forces of elves and dwaves. After run-ins with Blackwolf's assassins and some pesky fairies, Team Avatar takes shelter with the dwarf army. However, Elinore is entranced by Blackwolf's evil and kills Peace. Avatar thinks that she has betrayed them, and gets all emo as he and Weehawk continue on their mission. They split up, where Weehawk learns of Elinore's enslavement and frees her, while Avatar confronts Blackwolf for the last time. Not to give away the ending, but Avatar's coup de grace on Blackwolf is just perfect! Anyway, the forces of good win, and Avatar shacks up with Elinore(lucky bastard!).This was Bakshi's first fantasy movie, which lead into his directing the original animated Lord Of The Rings movie. Wizards also marked the beginning of his use of rotoscope which merges live-action footage with animation. This works sometimes during some of the battlefield scenes, but does get a little tedious at parts. Another way of getting around actually animating some parts was to include comic-like illustrations to narrate the story, including some by Marvel Comics artist Mike Ploog. Bakshi insists that this was a family film, although there is a good amount of gore, nudity, and sexual innuendo(not that I'm complaining!). Wizards sports some great character designs and backgrounds, even though they seem slightly Tolkien-based, which arguably went on to inspire the style used in the Elfquest comic book series which debuted about two years after this movie. I highly recommend this movie for those who want a look into early 70s animation, and for some great fantasy storytelling!",4,Special Magical Pixy Power!!!!!,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,2740,"['James', 'Cameron', 'Avatar', 'master', 'animation', 'Ralph', 'Bashki', 'did', 'own', 'take', 'science', 'vs.', 'nature', 'What', 'was', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'very', 'first', 'full-length', 'animated', 'motion', 'picture', 'Wizards', 'proved', 'be', 'success', 'own', 'time', 'cult', 'classic', 'decades', 'come.Set', 'post-apocalyptic', 'Earth', 'humanity', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'nuclear', 'war', 'eldritch', 'then', 'come', 'hiding', 'including', 'elves', 'fairies', 'dwarves', 'revival', 'magic', 'two', 'brother', 'wizards', 'fued', 'control', 'power', 'evil', 'wizard', 'Blackwolf', 'land', 'Scortch', 'where', 'goblins', 'mutants', 'dwell', 'peaceful', 'brother', 'Avatar', 'fairy', 'realm', 'Montagar', 'Blackwolf', 'take', 'over', 'Montagar', 'sending', 'robot', 'out', 'kill', 'leaders', 'robot', 'Necron', '99', 'fairy', 'president', 'taken', 'out', 'Avatar', 'who', 'be', 'Peace', 'reformed', 'robot', 'lead', 'Scortch', 'quest', 'elf', 'ranger', 'Weehawk', 'boobalicious', 'fairy', 'princess', 'Elinore', 'Blackwolf', 'turn', 'dug', 'up', 'old', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'movies', 'motivate', 'troops', 'stun', 'opposing', 'forces', 'elves', 'dwaves', 'run-ins', 'Blackwolf', 'assassins', 'pesky', 'fairies', 'Team', 'Avatar', 'shelter', 'dwarf', 'army', 'However', 'Elinore', 'entranced', 'Blackwolf', 'evil', 'kills', 'Peace', 'Avatar', 'betrayed', 'emo', 'Weehawk', 'continue', 'mission', 'split', 'up', 'where', 'Weehawk', 'Elinore', 'enslavement', 'Avatar', 'confronts', 'Blackwolf', 'last', 'time', 'Not', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'Avatar', 'coup', 'de', 'grace', 'Blackwolf', 'just', 'perfect', 'Anyway', 'forces', 'good', 'win', 'Avatar', 'up', 'Elinore', 'lucky', 'bastard', '.This', 'was', 'Bakshi', 'first', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'lead', 'directing', 'original', 'animated', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movie', 'Wizards', 'also', 'marked', 'beginning', 'use', 'rotoscope', 'live-action', 'footage', 'animation', 'sometimes', 'battlefield', 'scenes', 'get', 'little', 'tedious', 'parts', 'way', 'getting', 'actually', 'animating', 'parts', 'was', 'include', 'comic-like', 'illustrations', 'narrate', 'story', 'including', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'artist', 'Mike', 'Ploog', 'Bakshi', 'was', 'family', 'film', 'good', 'amount', 'gore', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'not', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'Wizards', 'sports', 'great', 'character', 'designs', 'backgrounds', 'even', 'seem', 'slightly', 'Tolkien-based', 'arguably', 'went', 'inspire', 'style', 'used', 'Elfquest', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'debuted', 'two', 'years', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'want', 'look', 'early', '70s', 'animation', 'great', 'fantasy', 'storytelling']",Wizards VHS

The film still holds up, and has aged better than most films of its type coming out around this period though it is clearly a product of the 70's era.  Many, myself included find it a better film than the Lord of the Rings animated movie that it was supposedly a test for.  I believe many times reviewers tend to critique films based on all the films that have followed them rather than what preceded them.  Animation in America was still considered strictly a Kiddie medium when Wizards was released.  Wizards was among the few animated films to have adult themes, as anime was still years away from becoming a household word.  There seems to be many negative reactions to it for it's ""hippy philosophy"", but when one considers that the movie Avatar pretty much shares that same philosophy and has become the highest grossing picture of all time, it becomes something of a puzzle.  There are some surprise voice talent associated with this film including Mark Hamill and Susan Tyrell.  For the comic fans this movie was a strong influence on Wendy Pini's Elfquest saga.  It would have been nice to see a bit more extras, but hey.

269170,A2TY5K56U4NMQZ,6301801709,Jason R Blalack,"[8, 9]","One of my favorite Ralph Bakshi films which showcases his transition into the genre of Fantasy.  Being released the same year as other blockbusters like Close Encounters, Star Wars, and Sat. Night Fever, this film found its niche with the college crowds which had already embraced Fritz and Heavy Traffic.  Bakshi uses the holocaust of the earth and the emergence of elves, fairies, wizards, and dwarves to showcase his allegories on the formation of the state of Israel and the continuing threat of facism, as always Bakshi's films have deeper meanings.In the film the good, cigar chomping, wizard Avatar and his companions make a perilous journey into the dark land of Scortch to destroy his evil twin, Black Wolf (a name used later by the hero in Fire &amp; Ice).  In the meantime, Blackwolf has been using his army of mutants to attack the outlying lands which has so far been unsuccessful.  He comes up with a plan to have assassins take out the free world's leaders and use a &quot;dream machine&quot; to cause fear and chaos in the enemy by plunging them in the midst of WWII combat, thus firing up his armies and allowing them to march in unapposed.This film was made prior to LOTR (Originally titled LOTR part 1)and many elements of the rotoscoping technique can be seen in early stages before perfecting them for LOTR.  Bakshi utilized stock footage for his evil armies from a variety of sources - my favorite being footage from the classic film Zulu.  The animation is rougher than in his later films but much smoother than that seen in Fritz, Heavy Traffic, and Coonskin.  The backgrounds used are mindblowing - from simple watercolors to some really intricate and psychedelic technical drawings.  The typical Bakshi humor is present and dark as usual - ie. the rabbai's, good ol' Larry, and the assassin, Peace (who originally had the Grateful Dead's &quot;Steal your Face&quot; logo on his saddle - only to have it later removed).  All in all this film is a visual treat - a little violent and some risque (ala F. Frazetta) costumes for the female characters, but always full of surprises.

So if you love fun fantasy, sci-fi and animated flicks then pick this up for your animation DVD collection.Also recommended: "" Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", "" Fist of the North Star"" ( Anime version), "" Braveheart"", "" Gladiator"", "" Mad Max"", "" The Last Unicorn"", "" The Secret of NIMH"", "" Rock & Rule"", "" The Dark Crystal"", "" The Princess Bride"", "" Star Wars"", "" Gettysburg"", "" Starship Troopers"", "" Total Recall"", "" Heavy Metal"", "" The Fifth Element"", "" Mulan"", ""Antz"".",5,Bakshi's masterpiece finally on DVD!!!!,1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,1688,"['1977', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'made', 'animated', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'set', 'post-apocalyptic', 'future', 'where', 'mutants', 'monsters', 'fairies', 'elves', 'dwarves', 'magical', 'creatures', 'roam', 'evil', 'wizard', 'named', 'Blackwolf', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'mutant', 'army', 'using', 'old', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'films', 'kind', 'powerful', 'wizard', 'named', 'Avatar', 'hot', 'fairy', 'chick', 'named', 'Ellinor', 'brave', 'elf', 'named', 'Weehawk', 'including', 'robot', 'named', 'Peace', 'join', 'together', 'go', 'place', 'called', 'Scorch', 'then', 'stop', 'Blackwolf', 'war', 'prevent', 'end', 'world.A', 'unique', 'kadeldoscopic', 'entertaining', 'animated', 'fantasy', 'director', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'Animated', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'American', 'Pop', 'animation', 'quite', 'good', 'have', 'Mark', 'Hamil', 'voice', 'debut', 'was', 'Star', 'Wars', 'same', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'superhot', 'fairy', 'chick', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'guys', 'smile', 'good', 'fun', 'flick', 'whole', 'family', 'even', 'rated', 'PG', 'due', 'graphic', 'animated', 'violence', 'battle', 'scenes', 'language', 'mild', 'nudity.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'extras', 'include', 'TV', 'Spot', 'Trailers', 'documentary', 'how', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'created', 'movie', 'still', 'gallery', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'So', 'love', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'sci-fi', 'animated', 'flicks', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'animation', 'DVD', 'collection.Also', 'recommended', 'Terminator', '2', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'Fist', 'North', 'Star', 'Anime', 'version', 'Braveheart', 'Gladiator', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'Secret', 'NIMH', 'Rock', 'Rule', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Gettysburg', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Mulan', 'Antz']",Wizards VHS

Some of the clips that were used to did not seem to fit, it seemed as if there only purpose was to fill time.The interview with Bakshi is actualy more entertaining than the movie, in it He calls this a ""Family movie"" Trust me, anyone under the age of 14 will most likely be bored to tears.

269179,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,6301801709,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[14, 33]","I don't know what Ralph Bakshi was thinking when he made this post-apocalyptic animated ""fantasy"" about an evil wizard who uses Nazi propaganda films to stir his mutant minions to conquer the earth and his brother trying to stop him, but I know what I am thinking: if this is the sort of film Bakshi considers the pinnacle of his career, then I am a monkey's uncle. Granted, WIZARDS does have some interesting aspects, such as vibrantly drawn stills (accompanied by a very BORING, monotonous female voiceover/narrator) and a pretty song during the closing credits, but the overall package is an unbearable, incoherent mess that lacks any kind of entertainment for fans of adult animation or otherwise.I am not an advocate against adult animated movies; there are some, like PERFECT BLUE, which are well done. WIZARDS attempts to be an edgy good VS evil fantasy epic. Unfortunately it fails on many regards. For one thing, the animation is appalling: it's cheap, nasty, and at times, almost like a cut-rate Saturday morning cartoon. In a story like this, such an atmosphere (with goofy-looking characters and some truly disgusting looking monsters) is inappropriate. Probably the most interesting sequences are when Bakshi uses ""rotoscoped"" techniques--which are actual live-actors painted with neon shadow colors in post-production. While this makes for a unique look (not to mention economically safer for Bakshi's sake), it clashes with the cartoonish backdrops, only ensuring the poor production values. There is even one bizarre sequence where we see actual footage from a war movie substituting as a background while the crudely drawn elves perform giggle-induced belly flops with the corresponding ""BOINK!"" sound effects in the background. These clashing styles only put an even bigger damper on the artwork itself; the mismatched visuals, believe it or not, actually look worse on DVD than on video or in theaters. (The digital transfer even suffers from digital defects.)Where WIZARDS really falls apart, however, is in the characterization and plot departments.  The overly deadpan female voiceover informs us that the wizard brothers Avatar and Blackwolf are two different opposites: Avatar is pure and loving of nature, while Blackwolf relishes darkness. That description goes out the window when we actually meet the brothers on screen. Avatar, instead of being the gentle, grandfatherly like wizard the narrator described to us earlier, is a dwarfish, grouchy old codger, spending much of the time rambling and holding a cigar beneath his foot. Blackwolf is as gruesome and ugly as we would expect, but all we learn from him is that he wants to take over the world, and consequently, isn't much more interesting than his brother. The same sadly applies to the other characters. There's a very scantily clad fairy female that coos in a grating, giggly voice--she serves no purpose other than to provide something for hormonal boys to swoon at. Only an elf warrior displays something in the way of an interesting personality; very aggressive and bold, he probably might be the only one worth rooting for. But there's nothing appealing or compelling about any of the rest of the cast.Matters are not helped by the needlessly jumbled overcomplicated plot, which jumps all over the place with no clear direction and throws in some needless, unnecessarily baffling plot twists (such as the fairy character suddenly turning evil and almost written off as a traitor... only to be redeemed at the end). There are even some offensively horrendous sequences (the bottom of a creature with a Jewish star marked on it dangling from a rope in a swastika-adorned throne room, and two praying dwarf priests who beat each other up), and plenty of others involving the cast muttering dialogue that only someone on drugs could construct.  When a plot this confusing is gutted by an even more mind numbing script, it makes the experience of watching WIZARDS even more frustrating as a viewer.The aural aspects of the film, aside from the aforementioned end title song, are just as displeasing. The voice acting (which includes a then unknown Mark Hamill) is dry and awkward, with the worst offenders being the fairy's obnoxious giggling and the boring (and I mean boring with a capital B) narrator. The cheesy synthesizer pop music is, well, just that: cheesy. (Matters are not made any better by the Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo or Mono tracks; both sound very hollow and flat.)I did find the extras on this disc somewhat interesting; there are still galleries, two (very bad) theatrical trailers, a TV spot, and a 30-minute interview with Bakshi himself. He comes across as a rambling, disgruntled fellow who tells a story that makes no more sense than this movie does; this probably explains the dubious quality of his output. Indeed, from seeing other films of his such as FIRE AND ICE (probably his best, though that's not saying much) and his hideous ""treatment"" of LORD OF THE RINGS, Bakshi does have some talent, but he spends most of the time offending rather than getting the point across.I understand that this film has its loyal following and I do recognize that Bakshi has his merits as an artist, but WIZARDS has never been on my list of favorites, and I cannot recommend it. There are plenty of FAR, far better animated movies than this wretchedly animated, dated, misguided mess.",1,Bakshi fans will hate me for this....,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,5384,"['do', ""n't"",

I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]Wizards - We upgraded from DVD to Blu Ray Book (full of awesome artwork from the film)Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):Classic story of good vs. evil in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged for millions of years after terrorists set off nuclear war.  Classical themes are visited as twin wizards, one light and full of love - the other a twisted mutant full of rage and anger, battle it out for control of the planet.  Full of beautifully animated wizards, elves, fairies, mutants, and breath-taking sceneries.  Will Avatar (voiced by Bob Holt in a near perfect Peter Faulk impersonation) and his rag-tag band overcome his evil twin Blackwolf and his horde of mutants?  Only one way to find out... pick up a copy and watch this terrific flick :]Ralph Bakshi, famed animator of such cult classics as Fritz the Cat, Heavy Traffic, and 1978's animated Lord of the Rings, pulled together an incredible film to prove a point - he could produce an animated feature film that could merge more adult themes and intelligence while remaining family-friendly to counter a Disney dominated bubble gum film genre.  In his own words, ""... it doesn't matter how slick you are, it's how much heart they have..."" and this film certainly has a lot of heart.  I bumped into Wizards for the first time in the late 80's when a friend picked up a copy on VHS.  So here is where I am going to go off the rails a little bit.  Ridiculous, I understand but here it is - on the one hand, it's a cartoon fantasy; on the other hand, it's a story with grown up topics (love, war, technology dependence, death, etc., etc.)  Wizards kind of help a teen-aged movie dude bridge the gap between childhood and adult.  It changed the course of my thinking and I started asking bigger questions about subjects like propaganda, the nature of government, and what kind of world was I inheriting vs. what kind of world do I want to live in.  Dude, that's terribly deep thoughts for a flick about battling wizards... what can I say, it is what it is.What I loved:1.  Staggering animation - from the backgrounds, the scary goons, the sexy fairies, and still galleries are done wonderfully.2.  The use of different animated styles to convey manifold emotional states; Scorch One is cold and hard - Montagar is warm and inviting.  He takes you to these extremes and everywhere in-between.3.  Intelligent story-telling that doesn't talk down to its audience.4.  It voices concerns about the dangers of over-dependence on technology which still find relevance in the here and now; I wonder as I sit and watch parents, eyes GLUED to their ""smart"" phones and the ubiquitous social media, while their children sit ignored (or worse)... lessons to be learned for sure.What I did NOT like:1.  Although it was originally meant to be a family-friendly film, it really isn't a good film for children (in my opinion); teens and up would be able to `get it' and watching fairy assassinations would be a HUGE culture shock for kids brought up on Disney.2.  The final battle sequence relied heavily on a process known as rotoscope (a processing of tracing over footage frame by frame) and stock footage; it was a money-saving move and you get what you pay for.Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

 nature versus technology?) are lost in the nonsensical plot, uneven animation, and terrible dialogue and characters.",1,utterly bizarre and inconsistent,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,2543,"['i', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'other', 'was', 'independent', 'animated', 'film', '70s', 'watching', 'i', 'feel', 'i', 'just', 'witnessed', 'someone', 'bad', 'lsd', 'trip', 'movie', 'wildly', 'inconsistent', 'illogical', 'shoddy', 'animation', 'idiotic', 'characters', 'story', 'sense', 'all.it', 'also', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'movie', 'ratings', 'have', 'changed', 'years', 'rated', 'pg', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'today', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'rated', 'r.', 'top', 'bloody', 'violence', 'tons', 'weird', 'nazi', 'sybolism', 'references', 'foul', 'language', 'even', 'stunning', 'amount', 'sexuality', 'most', 'female', 'characters', 'have', 'visibly', 'erect', 'nipples', 'skimpy', 'bikinis', 'gowns', 'are', 'prostitutes', 'even', 'implication', 'sexual', 'slavery', 'violence', 'times', 'was', 'as', 'graphic', 'animated', 'violence', 'heavy', 'metal', 'movie', 'was', 'rated', 'r.', 'nazi', 'symbolism', 'including', 'prominent', 'swaztikas', 'many', 'scenes', 'feels', 'incredibly', 'inappropriate', 'unnecessary', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'animated', 'films', 'children', 'should', 'shy', 'away', 'adult', 'themes', 'one', 'way', 'edge', 'i', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'letting', 'kids', 'watch', 'it.i', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'letting', 'adults', 'watch', 'either', 'movie', 'sense', ""n't"", 'have', 'single', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'animation', 'shifts', 'wildly', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'style', 'sloppy', 'rotoscoping', 'more', 'detailed', 'drawing', 'when', 'added', 'together', 'whole', 'thing', 'mess', 'plot', 'few', 'transitions', 'boring', 'narrated', 'interludes', 'were', 'apparently', 'used', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', 'animate', 'scenes', 'even', 'music', 'bad', 'soundtrack', 'composed', 'music', 'better', 'suited', 'softcore', 'porn', 'movie.the', 'main', 'character', 'avatar', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'wizard', 'lover', 'nature', 'almost', 'none', 'film', 'instead', 'across', 'incompetent', 'old', 'grouch', 'who', 'almost', 'nothing', 'intelligent', 'whole', 'movie', 'bad', 'guy', 'blackwolf', 'actually', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'thinly', 'characterized', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'movie', 'shifts', 'grim', 'violence', 'silly', 'humor', 'almost', 'same', 'scene', 'creating', 'mismatched', 'tone', 'up', 'being', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'just', 'mess', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'audience', 'nature', 'war', 'nature', 'versus', 'technology', 'are', 'lost', 'nonsensical', 'plot', 'uneven', 'animation', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'characters']",Wizards VHS

269189,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,6301801709,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[7, 14]","Before Ralph Bakshi got involved in the animated version of Lord of the Rings, he ventured into the fantasy animation realm with his classic, Wizards, which pitted cute, cuddly nature against evil, mutated technology.I saw this first when I was relatively young and was struck by both how interesting the tale was, the great potential for the story, and also how clumsily it was told. Seeing it several times in later years has reinforced those views.First, the animation. It was in Wizards that tested the use of 'rotoscoping', or using live action footage - colored in - to work with animation. The effect is rather unkempt looking in the movie, sort of like the animators didn't feel like putting the work in for complex scenes and instead stuck in a movie sequence they thought would fit.The drawing style is very in-your-face. The good guys are light and airy and cute. The bad guys are dark and evil and nasty. There's no complexity, no understanding of motives. The bad guys are just ""bad"".You've got Avatar, the hippy-wizard, with his big-breasted babe by his side. Together they go off to track down his evil brother, BlackWolf. BlackWolf isn't just 'mildly bad'. He is very deliberately shown with Nazi and other propaganda around him. He and his kind want to totally wipe out the fairy folk.Avatar claims that war is bad. But of course, he in essence declares war against BlackWolf and in the end uses those same ""nasty, evil"" weapons to bring BlackWolf down. Which reminds us that nobody really *wants* a war. But when we are faced with something we feel that we (and those around us) simply cannot live with, sometimes war seems to be the only option.I have fond thoughts of *bits* of the movie. There are individual, cute scenes, and the basic idea was a good, if quite overused, plot. But the movie was incredibly heavy-handed and obvious just about the entire way, and the message was beaten into you. The bimbo-girl was saddening as the representative of what females were, and in the end, was the lecherous hippie really that much better than the evil twin? Except, of course, he was ""cute"" and stood for the ""cute people"".Yes, the movie sweeps you along in a feel-good ""trounce all evil! stop all war!"" mindset. But any movie that trains you to chant mantras and look at things as black-and-white is not a movie that makes you think or constructively evaluate. Lord of the Rings had an 'evil ruler' that 'good people' had to struggle against, and that story is FAR more complex and thought-provoking than this even began to be. So maybe rent this one to learn more about how animation changed over the years, but this is not a movie that deserves multiple watching, given the wealth of quality anime that exist.",3,"A step in animation, but a black-and-white story",1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,2730,"['Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'got', 'involved', 'animated', 'version', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'ventured', 'fantasy', 'animation', 'realm', 'classic', 'Wizards', 'pitted', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'nature', 'evil', 'mutated', 'technology.I', 'saw', 'first', 'when', 'was', 'relatively', 'young', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'interesting', 'tale', 'was', 'great', 'potential', 'story', 'also', 'how', 'clumsily', 'was', 'told', 'Seeing', 'several', 'times', 'later', 'years', 'reinforced', 'views.First', 'animation', 'was', 'Wizards', 'tested', 'use', ""'rotoscoping"", 'using', 'live', 'action', 'footage', 'colored', 'work', 'animation', 'effect', 'rather', 'unkempt', 'looking', 'movie', 'sort', 'animators', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'putting', 'work', 'complex', 'scenes', 'instead', 'stuck', 'movie', 'sequence', 'thought', 'would', 'fit.The', 'drawing', 'style', 'very', 'in-your-face', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'light', 'airy', 'cute', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'dark', 'evil', 'nasty', 'complexity', 'understanding', 'motives', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'bad', '.You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Avatar', 'hippy-wizard', 'big-breasted', 'babe', 'side', 'Together', 'go', 'off', 'track', 'down', 'evil', 'brother', 'BlackWolf', 'BlackWolf', ""n't"", 'just', ""'mildly"", 'bad', 'very', 'deliberately', 'shown', 'Nazi', 'other', 'propaganda', 'kind', 'want', 'totally', 'wipe', 'out', 'fairy', 'folk.Avatar', 'claims', 'war', 'bad', 'course', 'essence', 'declares', 'war', 'BlackWolf', 'end', 'same', 'nasty', 'evil', 'weapons', 'bring', 'BlackWolf', 'down', 'Which', 'nobody', 'really', 'war', 'when', 'are', 'faced', 'something', 'feel', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'sometimes', 'war', 'be', 'only', 'option.I', 'have', 'fond', 'thoughts', '*bits*', 'movie', 'are', 'individual', 'cute', 'scenes', 'basic', 'idea', 'was', 'good', 'quite', 'overused', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'heavy-handed', 'obvious', 'just', 'entire', 'way', 'message', 'was', 'beaten', 'bimbo-girl', 'was', 'saddening', 'representative', 'what', 'females', 'were', 'end', 'was', 'lecherous', 'hippie', 'really', 'that', 'much', 'better', 'evil', 'twin', 'course', 'was', 'cute', 'stood', 'cute', 'people', '.Yes', 'movie', 'feel-good', 'trounce', 'evil', 'stop', 'war', 'mindset', 'movie', 'chant', 'mantras', 'look', 'things', 'black-and-white', 'not', 'movie', 'think', 'constructively', 'evaluate', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'had', ""'evil"", 'ruler', ""'good"", 'people', 'had', 'struggle', 'story', 'FAR', 'more', 'complex', 'thought-provoking', 'even', 'began', 'be', 'So', 'maybe', 'rent', 'one', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'animation', 'changed', 'years', 'not', 'movie', 'multiple', 'watching', 'given', 'wealth', 'quality', 'anime', 'exist']",Wizards VHS

Bakshi was already something of a god to the revolutionarily inclined of my generation, and there was no question but that a group of us were going to see it. We were wowed, enthralled, and heartened by Bakshi's brilliant combination of a strong story and inventive animation back then. And today, years later, I found myself thinking feeling the same way while watching it again.For three weeks the film was a smash hit, when one of those weird accidents of fate happen and Wizards was pushed of the stage by the arrival of Star Wars. Suddenly Bakshi's fable was relegated to fond memorys, only to reappear in retrospectives and campus theaters. As you will find out when you listen to the excellent Bakshi interview (more of a monologue), Wizards was the film dearest to the artists heart, the one he felt was his best accomplishment.Despite its rough language, partial nudity, and high level of violence, Bakshi though of this as a children's tale, albeit one that hewed closer to the true than the sugar coated fantasies that were coming out of Disney's studios. Set in far post apocalyptic times, two brothers are born to a queen of the fairies. One at distorted mutant (Blackwolf) and the other normal (Avatar), both potent wizards. The inevitable clash between then happened, and this is the story of the end of a 3,000 year struggle between the two over the fate of the world.The story shifts between the two wizards. First the machinations and plots of Blackwolf, as he unearths archaic Nazi technology and turns it into an weapon designed to erase the magical from the world. Then the journey of Avatar and two elvish friends, Elinore and the warrior Weehawk, who are seeking the source of Blackwolf's power.The story is told with a deft hand as both the narrator and the characters use humor more than dramatic horror to bring the lessons of the film home. The horror, especially that of the battlefield and the aftermath of war is never far behind.

269195,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6301801709,Michael R Gates,"[7, 7]","Ralph Bakshi's Tolkien-esque animated film WIZARDS (1977) is a surreal depiction of life on Earth hundreds of thousands of years following a devastating nuclear holocaust.  Humanoids are now divided into two groups, one a vast race of multifarious mutants who embrace the remnants of science and technology, the other a loose society of peaceable elves, dwarfs, and fairies who abhor pre-holocaust technology and instead practice a lifestyle based on magic and wizardry. The mutants are governed by the depraved, warmongering mutant Blackwolf; the elves and fairies look to the wizard Avatar, Blackwolf's dwarfish fraternal twin brother, for leadership.  Hatred and resentment towards his happy-go-lucky brother spurs Blackwolf to amass his mutant subjects into a great army, and he invades Avatar's kingdom with a Nazi-like fury.  The fate of the Earth and its inhabitants, then, will ultimately be decided in a violent bout of sibling rivalry.Writer/director Bakshi started his career in animated films at the age of 18, at which time he was hired by the Terrytoons Studio to paint or opaque animation cels.  He quickly worked his way up through the ranks, ultimately helming episodes of made-for-TV kiddie cartoon series like DEPUTY DAWG (1959-1972) and SPIDER-MAN (1967-1970).  But Bakshi longed to create films with more substance, films for a more mature audience.  So in 1972, he and producer Steve Krantz put together the low-budget film FRITZ THE CAT, a semi-pornographic feature-length cartoon--the first to earn an ""X"" rating--based on Robert Crumb's popular ""underground"" comic.  After another X-rated counter-culture feature, 1973's HEAVY TRAFFIC, Bakshi created a controversial racial satire called COONSKIN (1975) that Paramount immediately pulled from theaters after initial showings stirred up public outrage and protest.  Bakshi then decided it was better to play it safe and try for something more mainstream, and the result was 1977's sci-fi/fantasy flick WIZARDS.Bakshi was apparently not too familiar with the two genres that he grafted together for WIZARDS, as the storyline is often confusing and the characterizations uneven.  But in spite of the weak narrative and such, the film has become a cult classic since its initial release because of its stunning and groundbreaking visuals.  Bakshi and his crew intermix traditional animation with multiple styles of static comic-book art, tinted live-action backgrounds, augmented rotoscoped animation, and even Nazi propaganda footage from WWII.  Stirred into this mix is a myriad of subtle and not-so-subtle anti-war and other socio-political symbols and visual cues, and the result is a breathtaking aesthetic tour de force that can best be described as a sort of kinetic collage.The DVD edition of WIZARDS from FOX is simply wonderful.  Though some minor wear and filmic artifacts are noticeable at times, the digital transfer is fairly clean and offers the rich colors and detail that the film deserves.  The disc presents WIZARDS in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio and has been enhanced for 16x9 televisions, and some great bonus material is offered, too.  There is a feature commentary in which Ralph Bakshi himself offers many insights into his motivation for creating the film and also talks about some of the folks who assisted in its creation.  Also included is an interesting featurette entitled RALPH BAKSHI: THE WIZARD OF ANIMATION--basically a 30-minute interview with Bakshi in which he discusses everything from his beginnings at Terrytoons Studious to his work on WIZARDS and beyond--two theatrical trailers, a TV spot, and a cool gallery of production art.This DVD is well worth the cost of admission.

269198,A1KAR9G699RM56,6301801709,M. Miller,"[6, 8]","When I was younger, I remember viewing the animated Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I always wanted to find them again, and thankfully I did.  What I was unaware of was that director Bakshi had also made a previous movie, and thanks to my local library, I viewed it.This one actually has a similar tone to it, although this is not nearly as lengthy and, as I'm pretty sure, does not have specific literary ties either.The story is a post-apocalyptic film, where most people have turned into mutants.  Now, in the area not infected by radiation, or subsequently mutants, live fairies, elves, and possibly other humans although their existence is murky at best.  Each group is led by one of two brothers, an elf and a mutant.  They fought previously and the good one, the elf, defeated his brother.  However, some five thousand years have passed and the mutant brother has amassed knowledge, an army, and the ultimate fighting weapon.In my initial analysis I would first like to state that this is not a kids movie.  Like my title points out, this film is American anime, which never really caught on like Japanese anime has.  Either way, swearing and violence, especially violence, can be found in this film.So upon reaching the conclusion that this is for adults I approached the film from a much different perspective.  For example there is a lot of historical context, which can be clearly seen in the mutants connection with the ""third Reich"".  These images are presented to us as evidence of man's downfall, although the characters (well maybe the non-mutants) are not aware of the historical significance.  That with a storyteller narration every now and then helps present this film, as many post-apocalyptic films are shown, with a warning.My only warnings to you are to remember 70's animation, especially this type, is not that great.  Moreover, this film could have been more developed; 80-minute run-time for this level of complexity is just not enough.

269199,ADQQE8RSV6KFP,6301801709,"Mondo Vendo ""Mondo Vendo""","[6, 11]","Coonskin is one of my all-time favorite movies ever (a true favorite not just an animated favorite). I am also a huge fan of Heavy Traffic. Coonskin I have watched close 100 times. I had a vhs copy for about 15 years and watch more than a few times a year. I know have it on bootleg dvd and would love to buy an official copy (if there was one)Besides these two absolute masterpieces Bakshi is also known for the ok Fritz the Cat.Both Fritz and Heavy Traffic were originally rated X. Coonskin got pulled after immediate racial controversy. Though I wonder how Bakshi could ever be considered close to real X rated material, Bakshi is primarily known as animation for adults.In the special features Bakshi describes this as his favorite creation and is very proud to have created a great kid's movie. He also describes it as a family movie.I have to say, I don't know about Bakshi's sense of judgement if he considers this a ""kid's"" movie. I agree with his assessment of Disney talking down to kid's but I don't see how Wizards can be considered ""kid's"" material.He has prostitutes soliciting passerby's near the beginning of the movie. He has someone machine gunning ""the president"" blowing him full of holes near the beginning. Avatar's girlfriend is a fairy in a skimpy outfit with her nipples poking bumps in the cloth. There is plenty of Nazi propaganda, war images, etc.We even have Jewish rabbis (I assume they are rabbis) praying cartoonishly with great ernest and then hitting each other with two by fours and pouring water from watering cans on each other. Obviously some type of statement about religion.This is kid's material? I have to wonder just what he considers is the difference between this and Coonskin, etc? The absence of 4 letter words? And no nudity? (well some fairy's were totally nude so that can't be it)As for me, I thought Wizards was extremely mixed between good and bad.For one, the animation ranges from interesting ""Bakshi style characters"" to overly cutesy characters like Avatar the Wizard to uninteresting generic characters like the elves.The movement of the animation is also pretty poor throughout the film and does use a lot of stills. I believe this is mostly attributed to the budget.The story is surrealistically preachy. It feels like it is trying to hammer home a message but you never really know what the message is exactly.

I was so blown away, I continued to try to watch all of his films including &quot;Fritz the Cat,&quot; &quot;Heavy Traffic,&quot; &quot;Coonskin&quot; (aka Streetfight) etc.  What I realized was that Bakshi is an artist using a medium that traditionally has been set aside for Children.  &quot;Wizards&quot; is a great example of his creativity and his no &quot;BS&quot; approach to film as art.  The dialogue is natural and to the point.  The style is jarring and varied.  The characters are always interesting, and the story is actually more complex than it seems.  Magic is a metaphor for the &quot;soul&quot; and the human spirit which is in contstant war with technology.This long awaited DVD presentation is nothing short of spectacular.  It is presented in an enhanced widescreen format and the picture is brilliant.  It has never looked so good.  What I really enjoyed about this DVD is the fantastic stories that Ralph Bakshi tells.  One truly appreciates his passion for animated film and his great character.  I think it is about time he got the respect and acknowledgment he deserves.

Films like this seem to be relics of the past, as our culture continues to strive towards ever-increasing levels of sterility and mediocrity concerning all art produced for the masses, especially mass-marketed films and music.I have had no known previous exposure to Ralph Bakshi, so I cannot comment on how this film stacks up against his other works like ""Fritz the Cat"", ""Heavy Traffic"", ""Coonskin"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""American Pop"", ""Hey Good Lookin'"" or ""Fire and Ice"". But I did find his style to be a one-of-a-kind visual feast, with a brilliantly conceived plot, and plenty of tripped-out atmospherics (check out that hippy-dippy score!) sure to delight the aurae stimulated herb smokers among us.The story unfolds in a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by nuclear holocaust, where radiation in the ""badlands"" has turned man into hideously deformed mutants. In the goodlands there lives Delia, ""Queen of the Fairies"" who one night, under grave premonitions, gives birth to a set of twins who are the epitomy of polar opposites. Avatar, an elvish looking wizard, is kind and good, who spends his time growing up entertaining his benevolent mother. Blackwolf, a treacherous mutant, spends his youth torturing small animals.The film moves ahead 3000 years where Blackwolf has taken control of the mutants in a wasteland called ""Scortch"", and sends the monsters he controls out to obliterate the believers of magic.My favorite lines of the movie come from an old elf who is teaching the village children the wisdom of the ages.""My children, the only true form of technology is nature. All other forms of man-made technology are perversions. The ancient dictators used technology to enslave the masses."" He is immediately slain with a sophisticated lazer-gun by one of Blackwolf's assassin's, a red-suited robot named Necron 99.During some of the frequent scenes utilizing the rotoscoping technique, (tracing a live-action film, and then animating the drawings)  we are shown sequences of how Blackwolf's previous attempts at world domination are thwarted until he uncovers the secrets of ancient warfare and channels the spirit of Hitler.Now, The world once again faces imminent destruction and domination from the tyrannical forces of fascism.Blackwolf's diametrical brother Avatar lives peacefully in a phallus-shaped castle in the goodlands with an excitable, mask-faced wacko, ""The President"", and his daughter, the buxom fairie princess, Elinore.After a sneak-attack in which Necron 99 succeeds in assassinating the President, Avatar uses his magic to subdue the killer, and seemingly re-programs him as the aptly named ""Peace"". ""...for this is what he hopefully will bring to pass.""The remainder of the movie is a hypnotizing, psychedelic journey following the exploits of Avatar, Elinore, Peace, and the leader of the elves, ""Weehawk"", as they set off to destroy Blackwolf, and save the good creatures from the sure doom his rule represents.Although in no ways representative of my spiritual views, I found myself quite empathetic to the message espoused in the under-riding, parabolic themes of this film.I would pay no heed to the obviously narrow-minded hacks who have given this one or two stars for a variety of unenlightened reasons, and check this fine work out for yourself. Esp. if you are a fan of anime which seeks to do more than the shallow aims of modern Disney and Pixar.One of the corporate reviews goes on and on about how this film is filled to the gills with ill-advised attempts at humor and how uninspired it is.

269221,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,6301801709,The Man With No Name,"[0, 0]","I discovered this film apx 3 years ago on Youtube.  I was trolling around for something animated to watch and decided to give this odd looking film a chance.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised by it.Let me be clear though, this is NOT for everyone.  Meaning not for: young children, adults who don't watch Anime or animated features, non-lovers of fantasy adventure, non-fans of quirky old films.  These people will not be fans of this.  That being said I will say that even Anime fans may not enjoy this.  It IS dated, suffers from poor editing at times, and story wise could have been better.  This film either strikes you or it doesn't, period.For those still curious, here is the low down:**Minor Spoilers Ahead**The film begins with the Earth exploding into a nuclear war.  A nuclear war started by 5 terrorists detonating bombs the narrator says.  2 Million years go by and some of the planet is inhabitable again.  Quite a length of time...Well anyway, the humans who didn't die of radiation sickness or cancers survived and became Mutants.  As the films states each generation got worse than the last, now these Mutants are so far removed from their original Human descendants that they are hopeless.With the decline of the Humans and their technology, magical beings start to re-immerge.  Elves, Fairies, Dwarves, etc, all come out of the woodwork and start to repopulate the world.  Enter the Fairy Queen, (whose name slips my mind right now), she is out with the entire Fairy village during a festival and suddenly the sky turns black.  She rushes to her home.  Later the other villagers come to check on her and discover that like the Virgin Mary she has given birth to twins.  The movie never goes into detail why this happens.  Anywho...the twins are polarized, (just like Danny Devito and Arnold from 'Twins), Avatar is on the side of light and goodness, and Black Wolf born a Mutant is on the side of evil and darkness.This film was made in the 1970's, so they are not stealing the name 'Avatar', if anything, James Cameron is...The Queen Fairy never seems to recover from her delivery and dies, what seems like decades later, as Avatar has a long beard in the still scene.I forgot to mention, both twins are wizards and very powerful in the art of magic.  After the Queen dies, Black Wolf, who has despised his mother since birth, comes down on Avatar in battle.  He hopes to claim the land for himself with the Queen dead now.  Avatar and Black Wolf fight and Avatar defeats him, but for some reason spares his life.Black Wolf retreats to the radioactive ruins of the land of Scorch.  Avatar lives in what I believe is called Mandalay.It seems like the movie says millions of years go by, and then another scene says thousands of years go by.  As I said this movie suffers from bad editing at times.The movie then gets into it's sway with Black Wolf dispatching 3 assassins to kill the 3 major rulers of the free lands.  After which he plans to rally his evil demonic armies and overrun the good lands.**Summing up...**That's the plot.  As I said, your will either love it or hate it.  This film is disturbing at times.  Black Wolf is like Hitler reborn.  His armies bear the Swatzica on their arms and refer to Black Wolf as the ""Fuhrur.""  AND he rallies his armies for war by showing them old Nazi films from World War II.  As I said...disturbing.  One scene I just noticed today which I never did before was a scene where the little lizard man comes into the throne room to speak with Black Wolf.  He tells Black Wolf that the 3 rulers are dead, much to Black Wolf's delight.  There is a pig hanging dead with a hook in it's foot from the ceiling.  While Black Wolf is ranting about how it's time for the war to begin, the lizard man goes and rips a big piece of the pig off and eats it.  No big deal...right?  The lizard rips off a 2nd piece and the pig swings around to show it's belly.  What's on it's belly?  THE STAR OF DAVID!!!  WTF!!! INDEED!!!  Is that supposed to be a Jew hanging from there, who knows?  Ralph Bakshi is not racist as far as I know.  Perhaps there is some message there I'm missing.  Who knows.**In Conclusion**Dark film, dated in it's presentation, NOT for kids.  BUT...interesting and entertaining, and demands analyzing by some.  If you find yourself part of that few who think this sounds interesting give it a shot.  This film only exists because the fan-boys kept pestering Fox about releasing it.  So there must be a large fanbase out there for it.  Well, thank you fan-boys, without your success I would not have been able to see it and develope a liking for it as well.

It took me a few more years before I discovered ""Heavy Metal"" magazine, but Ralph Bakshi's ""Wizards"" was probably as close as I got to an introduction to that kind of underground comic style.For whatever reason, I felt a pique of interest in watching it some 35 years later. While I still admire what Bakshi did with an eccentric and new style of animation, ""Wizards"" has lost a little of its fascination over time. Bakshi (who started his career doing Terryoons for TV like ""Deputy Dawg"") wanted to prove he could do more than his controversial adult 'toons like ""Fritz The Cat"" of ""Heavy Traffic."" He also started using trace animation and the coloring in of stock footage, which makes for odd effect. But how Bakshi would consider this ""family fair"" is baffling, as the fairies and dwarves may be cute and fun, but the themes are strictly for grown-ups.In the war between the brother wizards Avatar and BlackWolf between magic and technology, the flagrant use of Nazi footage sure skips the subtlety of any message, and the heroine is clearly showing her nipples under her sheer fairy wear. (As to the Anti-Nazi themes, one needs to remember that Bakshi's family came to the US to escape persecution in WWII.) The jokes are often forced and poorly timed, with the 'goons' of BlackWolf's army often slipping into slapstick that - while dopey at age 17 - now seem like jaggedly improper fits. Still, Bakshi's vision for ""Wizards"" was unlike anyone else making animation at the time, and kin only to R. Crumb.I also have to admit that I am giving the ""Wizards"" DVD a bonus star because of the bonus feature interview with Bakshi. He talks about the politics of making the film, interesting tidbits about being pals with George Lucas and making his film the same time Lucas was readying ""Star Wars,"" and inside stories about becoming an animator in the early 60's. His talk explains a lot about the quirks in ""Wizards"" as well as his future ""Lord Of The Rings"" movie. Even more illuminating is hearing Bakshi explain that ""Wizards"" is his favorite among his creations, and the only one he ever has sat done for an interview upon its DVD release. To swipe from a title of one of his other movies, ""Wizards"" is a really Cool World.",4,Family Friendly from Fritz The Cat?,1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,2467,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'High', 'School', 'grindhouse', 'type', 'theater', 'ripe', 'age', '17', 'thought', 'was', 'fantastic', 'had', 'crazy', 'read', 'not', 'Disney', 'weird', 'animation', 'wizards', 'seemed', 'really', ""'adult"", 'time', 'took', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'discovered', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'magazine', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'Wizards', 'was', 'probably', 'as', 'close', 'got', 'introduction', 'kind', 'underground', 'comic', 'style.For', 'reason', 'felt', 'pique', 'interest', 'watching', '35', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'admire', 'what', 'Bakshi', 'did', 'eccentric', 'new', 'style', 'animation', 'Wizards', 'lost', 'little', 'fascination', 'time', 'Bakshi', 'who', 'started', 'career', 'doing', 'Terryoons', 'TV', 'Deputy', 'Dawg', 'wanted', 'prove', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'controversial', 'adult', ""'toons"", 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'Heavy', 'Traffic', 'also', 'started', 'using', 'trace', 'animation', 'coloring', 'stock', 'footage', 'odd', 'effect', 'how', 'Bakshi', 'would', 'consider', 'family', 'fair', 'baffling', 'fairies', 'dwarves', 'may', 'be', 'cute', 'fun', 'themes', 'are', 'strictly', 'grown-ups.In', 'war', 'brother', 'wizards', 'Avatar', 'BlackWolf', 'magic', 'technology', 'flagrant', 'use', 'Nazi', 'footage', 'sure', 'subtlety', 'message', 'heroine', 'clearly', 'showing', 'nipples', 'sheer', 'fairy', 'wear', 'Anti-Nazi', 'themes', 'one', 'remember', 'Bakshi', 'family', 'came', 'US', 'escape', 'persecution', 'WWII', 'jokes', 'are', 'often', 'forced', 'poorly', 'timed', ""'goons"", 'BlackWolf', 'army', 'often', 'slipping', 'slapstick', 'dopey', 'age', '17', 'now', 'seem', 'jaggedly', 'improper', 'fits', 'Still', 'Bakshi', 'vision', 'Wizards', 'was', 'anyone', 'else', 'making', 'animation', 'time', 'only', 'R.', 'Crumb.I', 'also', 'have', 'admit', 'am', 'giving', 'Wizards', 'bonus', 'star', 'bonus', 'feature', 'interview', 'Bakshi', 'politics', 'making', 'film', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'being', 'pals', 'George', 'Lucas', 'making', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'Lucas', 'was', 'readying', 'Star', 'Wars', 'stories', 'becoming', 'animator', 'early', '60', 'talk', 'lot', 'quirks', 'Wizards', 'as', 'well', 'future', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movie', 'Even', 'more', 'illuminating', 'hearing', 'Bakshi', 'explain', 'Wizards', 'favorite', 'creations', 'only', 'one', 'ever', 'sat', 'done', 'interview', 'DVD', 'release', 'swipe', 'title', 'one', 'other', 'movies', 'Wizards', 'really', 'Cool', 'World']",Wizards VHS

269225,A2VLPZ5FOXZJY5,6301801709,Tony Belding,"[7, 9]","In the late 1970s animation meant Disney, and Disney meant cute, sappy musicals aimed at small children.  A rare few films tried to break that mold.  Heavy Metal is the most well-known, but Wizards should be ranked right alongside it.  One might almost think of these as American proto-anime films.  If Wizards was made today and imported from Japan, it would probably be a hit with the anime crowd.  But, it wouldn't be revolutionary today as it was in 1977.Wizards is a movie that I have to love, and yet also weep for it.  The visual style is like nothing else out there.  Much of what we see presented on screen is so imaginative, artistic, and so original that I can't help wondering how this movie sank so far into obscurity.  Don't fret about the tired themes, thin plot and shallow characters -- other movies with great visual style (re: Star Wars) have succeeded in spite of similar shortcomings.  Wizards is great in a more impressionistic sense.And yet I weep.  Bakshi clearly didn't have the time or money needed to do this film justice, and the short-cuts needed simply to push it out the door are all too visible.  We have a scene with characters stumbling around in a blizzard, so drawing backgrounds wouldn't be necessary.  We have some scenes where the characters are sloppily drawn.  We have battle scenes that run too long and with too much rotoscoping, because it's cheaper than real animation.  There are even a few scenes that (in my opinion) didn't work and should have been left on the cutting-room floor -- but they couldn't be cut: every scrap of footage was needed to fill out the required running time for a theatrical release.So. . .  What we get is a flawed gem.  It's a singular vision marred by the economic realities of cel animation -- easily the most expensive way to make a movie.  I give it three stars not because it's mediocre or forgettable; it definitely is not.  I give it three stars because it contains about 3/5ths of what should have been a five-star movie, if the budget had been there to fill it out properly.",3,A Flawed Gem,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,2057,"['late', '1970s', 'animation', 'meant', 'Disney', 'Disney', 'meant', 'cute', 'sappy', 'musicals', 'aimed', 'small', 'children', 'rare', 'few', 'films', 'tried', 'break', 'mold', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'most', 'well-known', 'Wizards', 'should', 'be', 'ranked', 'right', 'One', 'might', 'almost', 'think', 'American', 'proto-anime', 'films', 'Wizards', 'was', 'made', 'today', 'imported', 'Japan', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'hit', 'anime', 'crowd', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'revolutionary', 'today', 'was', '1977.Wizards', 'movie', 'have', 'love', 'yet', 'also', 'weep', 'visual', 'style', 'nothing', 'else', 'there', 'Much', 'what', 'see', 'presented', 'screen', 'so', 'imaginative', 'artistic', 'so', 'original', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'how', 'movie', 'sank', 'so', 'far', 'obscurity', 'Do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'tired', 'themes', 'thin', 'plot', 'shallow', 'characters', 'other', 'movies', 'great', 'visual', 'style', 're', 'Star', 'Wars', 'have', 'succeeded', 'spite', 'similar', 'shortcomings', 'Wizards', 'great', 'more', 'impressionistic', 'sense.And', 'yet', 'weep', 'Bakshi', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'money', 'needed', 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'short-cuts', 'needed', 'simply', 'push', 'out', 'door', 'are', 'too', 'visible', 'have', 'scene', 'characters', 'stumbling', 'around', 'blizzard', 'drawing', 'backgrounds', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'necessary', 'have', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'sloppily', 'drawn', 'have', 'battle', 'scenes', 'run', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'much', 'rotoscoping', 'cheaper', 'real', 'animation', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'scenes', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting-room', 'floor', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'cut', 'scrap', 'footage', 'was', 'needed', 'fill', 'out', 'required', 'running', 'time', 'theatrical', 'release.So', 'What', 'get', 'flawed', 'gem', 'singular', 'vision', 'marred', 'economic', 'realities', 'cel', 'animation', 'easily', 'most', 'expensive', 'way', 'make', 'movie', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'not', 'mediocre', 'forgettable', 'definitely', 'not', 'give', 'three', 'stars', '3/5ths', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'five-star', 'movie', 'budget', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'fill', 'out', 'properly']",Wizards VHS
269226,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,6301801709,trashcanman,"[1, 2]","1977's highly-imaginative Wizards is a one-of-a-kind animated fantasy film from controversial filmmaker Ralph Bakshi, who was previously known for his X-rated debut Fritz the Cat.  Bakshi is the father of adult animation and presented himself as an alternative to the ""fake"" cartoons of Walt Disney Studios. He strove to give people reality through fantasy as opposed to the sugar-coated bubblegum of mainstream animation.  As a result, he had to struggle for each and every film he made and often completed his films using his own money and low-budget techniques such as roto-scoping.  Bakshi's films remain fairly obscure, as America still has yet to embrace animation as a viable form of entertainment for adults as well as children, but the cult following for his work speaks for itself.Interestingly, Bakshi views Wizards as proof that he can do a family film.  I suppose so long as movies filled with Nazi imagery, disturbing violence, horrific images, erect nipples, venomous insults, and pointed satire are considered family films he is right. He makes a pretty good family film. Wizards is an extremely remarkable film in a number of ways.  I was at first turned-off by the low-grade look of the animation and childish character designs, but this quickly wore off.  In fact, one of the remarkable things about it is the regular shift in visual styles. The film is actually quite the animated tour-de-force and sports some of the most astounding and creative images I've ever seen in an animated work.  We are introduced to the post-apocalyptic world via a number of fantastic still images as we learn about how a mere 5 man team of terrorists brought about the end of the world in a nuclear holocaust and eventual rebirth into an age of magic. The tale is one of two brothers: one good and one evil; both wizards.  Blackwolf (how can you name a kid that and not expect him to be evil?) has devoted himself to resurrecting the technology and ways of the old world and in doing so uncovers not only tanks and guns, but a secret weapon that will make him as powerful as the man he idolizes and emulates.  You know: the German guy with the funny little mustache.  One could do better for role models. The scene where Darkwolf unleashes his secret weapon on an overconfident elvish force who is used to scattering evil armies who have nothing to fight for is simply amazing.  I don't even want to ruin it by describing it.  I'll just say that nothing saps a decent person's will to fight like facing the horrors of war.  Meanwhile, Darkwolf's brother Avatar is more interested in smoking stogies and oggling the extremely perky g-stringed fairy princess Elinore the saving the world.  But an encounter with an assassin sparks him to action and he and his companions begin the journey to stop his brother and prevent a new holocaust.First off, I have to say that Avatar is a great character.  He has a very classic smart-alecky New York kind of attitude which you don't see in a lot of wizards in fantasy films. The supporting cast is fairly strong as well, if underdeveloped.  But the real star of Wizards is the sheer variety.  Aspects of horror, sci-fi, fantasy, and pulp are all over the place.  Then there is the striking mixture of psychedelic roto-scoped battle scenes (which were traced from stock footage because there was no money to animate them) with hand-drawn characters in the foreground and real-life black -and-white war footage mixed in as well. It comes off as haphazard at times, but when it works it is absolutely stupendous.  Seeing a real-life image reflected in an animated character's eyes is not something you expect.  The movie delivers the unexpected at nearly every turn, spattering political and social commentary here and there as the story twists and turns.  One particularly surprising scene highlights Bakshi's opinion on religion by having some characters stop in at a building full of ""religious artifacts"" from our world. The things we worshiped.  Among them is a Coca-Cola sign. A duo of old men then proceed to ""pray"" at length by pretty much mocking every major world religion in a hysterical flurry that mish-mashes several recognizable religious gestures and inconographies into a buffoonish display of satire that I could not believe I was seeing.  It was awesome.  Offensive as hell, but in an endearingly childish manner.What's that?  Family films don't mock people's deeply-held beliefs? Sssssh. Don't tell Ralph Bakshi that. No prostitutes allowed either?  Now you're just being a jerk.  Do heroes in family films call people ""son of a b!+@h"" and then gun them down? Do family films unceremoniously kill off cutesy characters and then show you the corpse? No, sir. Wizards hardly qualifies as a family film, no matter what the director says, but it is still an outstanding work of fantasy by any stretch.  It's not perfect since some of the excessive roto-scoping looks very shabby and the characters were more poorly developed then I'd have liked.  Well, if the production seems thrown-together it's because it was.  Bakshi worked on a microbudget that barely cracked six figures while every mainstream filmmaker was going millions of dollars over budget. And he was still on the very cusp of breakout success when Wizards was released to theaters and rocked the box office in spite of Disney's blatant attempt to crush it by releasing Fantasia at the same time. But 'twas not Disney's classical masterpiece that drove Wizards out of theaters after a very successful run of a mere two weeks.  Star Wars became a surprise smash and due to the massive demand, the low-grade animated fantasy film was pulled from theaters to accommodate more Star Wars screenings. Bummer.The DVD features a lengthy interview with Bakshi (where I gleaned a lot of the information for this review) and it's really hard not to like the guy.  Especially with what he's been through in the biz.  He's made some great films and some not so great ones, but he's a filmmaker that manages to deliver both style and substance in his works and he refuses to compromise his artistic values or talk down to his audience.  You've got to respect a guy like that. His Lord of the Rings adaptation may have been a failure, but I've enjoyed all the rest of his works that I've seen so far. It's certainly a unique animation style and fans of the medium should start with Wizards.4 1/2 stars, rounded down because I can't help but wonder how great it would have been if he hadn't been trying to make a children's film.",4,"""Just wake me up when the planet's destroyed.""",1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,6530,"['1977', 'highly-imaginative', 'Wizards', 'one-of-a-kind', 'animated', 'fantasy',

269227,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6301801709,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 5]","Ralph Bakshi's boho fantasy Wizards, like Richard Williams' doomed Thief and the Cobbler, is a reaction against Disney animated features and shares many of its flaws, as well as many of its own. For all his talk about wanting to show Disney how to tell a real story with real passion, there's a real lack of story and worse, a real lack of feeling that the dull characters and disinterested vocal performances only draw attention to. But perhaps most fatal of all is the largely uninteresting animation that often seems pitched somewhere between Filmation and underground comics, with the more interesting (and potentially expensive) sequences played purely as two-tone still concept images with Susan Tyrell's flat narration giving the film an uncompleted work-in-progress look. The use of crudely rotoscoped footage from El Cid, Alexander Nevsky and Zulu for the choppy battle scenes is also rather too awkward to work, especially since it is never properly integrated with the genuinely animated characters. At its heart there's a vaguely interesting notion (it's certainly not developed enough to be called an idea) about the war between technology and magic - embodied by two brother wizards at each others throats for thousands of years - coming to a head when the bad one discovers the motivating power of Nazi propaganda, but too often it's simply clumsily reacting against the Disney formula rather than telling a story and you can see all too clearly the early signs of just how badly Bakshi would mess up The Lord of the Rings here.Still, Fox's DVD boasts a nice widescreen transfer and a good selection of extras - an audio commentary by Bakshi and a 35-minute documentary on him and the film, various stills galleries, TV spot and two trailers.",2,Less than magical,1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,1757,"['Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'boho', 'fantasy', 'Wizards', 'Richard', 'Williams', 'doomed', 'Thief', 'Cobbler', 'reaction', 'Disney', 'animated', 'features', 'shares', 'many', 'flaws', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'own', 'talk', 'wanting', 'show', 'Disney', 'how', 'tell', 'real', 'story', 'real', 'passion', 'real', 'lack', 'story', 'worse', 'real', 'lack', 'feeling', 'dull', 'characters', 'disinterested', 'vocal', 'performances', 'only', 'draw', 'attention', 'perhaps', 'most', 'fatal', 'largely', 'uninteresting', 'animation', 'often', 'pitched', 'somewhere', 'Filmation', 'underground', 'comics', 'more', 'interesting', 'potentially', 'expensive', 'played', 'purely', 'two-tone', 'still', 'concept', 'images', 'Susan', 'Tyrell', 'flat', 'narration', 'giving', 'film', 'uncompleted', 'work-in-progress', 'look', 'use', 'crudely', 'rotoscoped', 'footage', 'El', 'Cid', 'Alexander', 'Nevsky', 'Zulu', 'choppy', 'battle', 'scenes', 'also', 'rather', 'too', 'awkward', 'work', 'especially', 'never', 'properly', 'integrated', 'genuinely', 'animated', 'characters', 'heart', 'vaguely', 'interesting', 'notion', 'certainly', 'not', 'developed', 'enough', 'be', 'called', 'idea', 'war', 'technology', 'magic', 'embodied', 'two', 'brother', 'wizards', 'others', 'throats', 'thousands', 'years', 'coming', 'head', 'when', 'bad', 'one', 'motivating', 'power', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'too', 'often', 'simply', 'clumsily', 'reacting', 'Disney', 'formula', 'rather', 'telling', 'story', 'can', 'see', 'too', 'clearly', 'early', 'signs', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'Bakshi', 'would', 'mess', 'up', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'here.Still', 'Fox', 'DVD', 'nice', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'good', 'selection', 'extras', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Bakshi', '35-minute', 'documentary', 'film', 'various', 'stills', 'galleries', 'TV', 'spot', 'two', 'trailers']",Wizards VHS

Some may criticize its lack of depth or the amateurish look of its rotoscoped sequences.  Others find the movie intriguing.  One thing you can never accuse Bakshi of though, is being bland.  His movies get people talking and I feel that's the most important quality any filmmaker or animator of any worth can have.  That being said, Wizards is a unique romp into a post-apocalyptic Earth now dominated by magic which had been previously supplanted by technology.  The good vs. evil themes are simplistic, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Good usually triumphs over evil in fantasy works and Wizards is no exception.  Bakshi's interview on this DVD is interesting and worth watching as well.

269230,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6301801709,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","Set in some undisclosed time in the future, Ralph Bakshi's ""Wizards"" appeared in 1977 during a time when fantasy films for adults were almost nonexistant. Produced on a meager $1 million (compare that to the contemporary Fox release ""Star Wars"" which was budgeted at around $10 million), ""Wizards"" is certainly flawed but Bakshi's mix of cartoon-style animation, stylized (and detailed)backgrounds and rotoscoped live action footage makes for a unique film that deals with a basic story of good vs. evil built around more adult elements.After a long, protracted battle the wizard Avatar (Bob Holt)banishes his evil twin brother Blackwolf (Steve Gravers). Decades have passed during which Blackwolf has assembled an army from throughout time summoned from Hell. Blackwolf has developed an arsenal of the older weapons that caused the destruction of the world knowing that he cannot beat his brother's magic and begins his assault by murdering the president. Avatar( assisted by a Elinore a fairy princess,Weehawk a warrior elf and the robot Peace who was created by Blackwolf but has overcome his programming) must defeat Blackwolf otherwise their world is doomed.The Blu-ray transfer for ""Wizards"" looks good although there are numerous analog flaws that haven't been cleaned up for this transfer. For example, the print used is far from pristine and there are plenty of specks, occasional bits of print damage and other issues that are the result of the style of animation presented here. The image is surprisingly sharp and the film retains its film-like quality with grain noticeable. It's clear that Fox didn't budget this release for a scale restoration.Released in the UK first, this edition features a lossless 5.1 mix (the UK version featured a stereo mix)although this edition does not include the music only option available on the UK version. Dialog is clear for the most part.The special features include the audio commentary track that Bakshi did for the 2005 DVD release. There are also two editions--one of them is a ""book"" like format with a nice booklet that includes a brief essay on the film as well as plenty of production drawings. There is also a regular Blu-ray version that does not include the booklet.We also get a 35 minute featurette on the making of the film that's informative covering everything from the inspiration for the film to the budget struggles and success of ""Wizards"" paving the way for Bakshi's film of the first two books of ""The Lord of the Rings"" as an animated epic.There are a number of stills galleries, two trailers and a TV spot. All of the special features are presented in standard definition and are ported over from the DVD.""Wizard"" remains highly imaginative and the largest flaws are Bakshi's writing (he would have benefited from working with a stronger writer such as Peter Beagle who wrote Bakshi'sThe Lord of the Rings: 1978 Animated Movie (Remastered Deluxe Edition). The other drawback is that Bakshi ran out of money prior to completing the film and the sequences that feature production drawings with narration clearly were designed to both simplify the story and to fill in the gaps left by the lack of funds. Still, the film is largely successful and remains entertaining. Still, you have to admire the dark humor that runs through the film as well as the early attempt to deal with more adult themes within the context of its story.The Blu-ray isn't flawless but it looks quite nice. The fact that Fox ported over the extras means that those looking to upgrade won't need to keep their DVD around. I should note, however, that there isn't a DVD included in this set and, while the book format is nice, the disc is only held in place by a small piece of cardboard so you may want to transfer this to a regular Blu-ray case.",4,"Bakshi's ""Wizards"" still manages to entertain 36 years later and includes nice special features for the Blu-ray edition.",1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,3790,"['Set', 'undisclosed', 'time', 'future', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'Wizards', 'appeared', '1977', 'time', 'when', 'fantasy', 'films', 'adults', 'were', 'almost', 'nonexistant', 'Produced', 'meager', '1', 'million', 'compare', 'contemporary', 'Fox', 'release', 'Star', 'Wars', 'was', 'budgeted', '10', 'million', 'Wizards', 'certainly', 'flawed', 'Bakshi', 'mix', 'cartoon-style', 'animation', 'stylized', 'detailed', 'backgrounds', 'rotoscoped', 'live', 'action', 'footage', 'unique', 'film', 'deals', 'basic', 'story', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'built', 'more', 'adult', 'elements.After', 'long', 'protracted', 'battle', 'wizard', 'Avatar', 'Bob', 'Holt', 'evil', 'twin', 'brother', 'Blackwolf', 'Steve', 'Gravers', 'Decades', 'have', 'passed', 'Blackwolf', 'assembled', 'army', 'time', 'summoned', 'Hell', 'Blackwolf', 'developed', 'arsenal', 'older', 'weapons', 'caused', 'destruction', 'world', 'knowing', 'can', 'not', 'beat', 'brother', 'magic', 'assault', 'murdering', 'president', 'Avatar', 'assisted', 'Elinore', 'fairy', 'princess', 'Weehawk', 'warrior', 'elf', 'robot', 'Peace', 'who', 'was', 'created', 'Blackwolf', 'overcome', 'programming', 'must', 'defeat', 'Blackwolf', 'otherwise', 'world', 'doomed.The', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'Wizards', 'good', 'are', 'numerous', 'analog', 'flaws', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'transfer', 'example', 'print', 'used', 'far', 'pristine', 'are', 'plenty', 'specks', 'occasional', 'bits', 'print', 'damage', 'other', 'issues', 'are', 'result', 'style', 'animation', 'presented', 'here', 'image', 'surprisingly', 'sharp', 'film', 'film-like', 'quality', 'grain', 'noticeable', 'clear', 'Fox', 'did', ""n't"", 'budget', 'release', 'scale', 'restoration.Released', 'UK', 'first', 'edition', 'lossless', '5.1', 'mix', 'UK', 'version', 'featured', 'stereo', 'mix', 'edition', 'not', 'include', 'music', 'only', 'option', 'available', 'UK', 'version', 'Dialog', 'clear', 'most', 'part.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'Bakshi', 'did', '2005', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'editions', 'one', 'book', 'format', 'nice', 'booklet', 'brief', 'essay', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'plenty', 'production', 'drawings', 'also', 'regular', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'not', 'include', 'booklet.We', 'also', 'get', '35', 'minute', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'informative', 'covering', 'everything', 'inspiration', 'film', 'budget', 'struggles', 'success', 'Wizards', 'paving', 'way', 'Bakshi', 'film', 'first', 'two', 'books', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'animated', 'are', 'number', 'stills', 'galleries', 'two', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spot', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'presented', 'standard', 'definition', 'are', 'ported', 'DVD', 'Wizard', 'highly', 'imaginative', 'largest', 'flaws', 'are', 'Bakshi', 'writing', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'working', 'stronger', 'writer', 'such', 'Peter', 'Beagle', 'who', 'wrote', ""Bakshi'sThe"", 'Lord', 'Rings', '1978', 'Animated', 'Movie', 'Remastered', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'other', 'drawback', 'Bakshi', 'ran', 'money', 'prior', 'completing', 'film', 'sequences', 'feature', 'production', 'drawings', 'narration', 'clearly', 'were', 'designed', 'simplify', 'story', 'fill', 'gaps', 'left', 'lack', 'funds', 'Still', 'film', 'largely', 'successful', 'entertaining', 'Still', 'have', 'admire', 'dark', 'humor', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'early', 'attempt', 'deal', 'more', 'adult', 'themes', 'context', 'story.The', 'Blu-ray', ""n't"", 'flawless', 'quite', 'nice', 'fact', 'Fox', 'ported', 'extras', 'looking', 'upgrade', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'keep', 'DVD', 'should', 'note', 'however', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'included', 'set', 'book', 'format', 'nice', 'disc', 'only', 'held', 'place', 'small', 'piece', 'cardboard', 'may', 'want', 'transfer', 'regular', 'Blu-ray', 'case']",Wizards VHS
