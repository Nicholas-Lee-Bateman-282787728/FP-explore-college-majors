1620860,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00B0W5RPU,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[2, 3]","Musclebear Roger and his twinkish boyfriend Tyler (who became a couple in the original 2010 ""Bear City"" film) decide to take advantage of NY's new gay marriage bill, despite some initial misgivings on Tyler's part.  Since they and most of their friends had already planned to be in Provincetown for ""Bear Week,"" they decided to hold the nuptuals there, staying in a guesthouse owned by Rose (Kathy Majimy), mother of their friend Brent (Stevem Guarino, who is one of the few bright spots in this misguided sequel). Lots going on amid the craziness in P-Town, including Brent and his partner interviewing attendees for a ""bear documentary"", and another couple making plans to open a new ""bear bar"" in NYC.The middle part of the film seems like a P-Town tourist promotion, with local attractions and huge crowds also (over)filled with marginal gay celebrities, from Kevin Smith to Frank DeCaro, Jason Stuart to Mike Ruiz, Mark Caruso and even Lt. Dan Choi, making this seem more like a vanity project than any attempt at a cohesive story.  We do learn that, even within the bear community, there is an element of discrimination between ""muscle bears"" and their more portly brethren, except that both groups are equally unable to be monogamous in a relationship.  Tyler meets a chubby bear he seems to develop a connection with, and Roger spends time with an ex he previously swore he never wanted to see again.  The ending was not what I was expecting, and somewhat disappointing, although I suppose it illustrated a valuable lesson ... that two men should not decide to get married simply because their state decides they now CAN do so.Besides the casting issues, the film seems disjointed in terms of pacing, more a series of skits than telling a story.  Some scenes clearly go on way too long, and add nothing to the film other than additional minutes. Some funny bits are milked too long (such as people calling Tyler's father, who is there for the ceremony, ""Daddy"", and how a threesome of bears next door needs a really large bed).  Most of all, the assorted disagreements and uncomfortable confrontations often overshadow the camaraderie of the bear community, which was an important selling point in the original film.DVD has a ""making of"" featurette, deleted scenes, director commentary and music videos; it is also subtitled in 15 languages!  Not rated, would be a heavy R for sexual content (No nudity).  I'm somewhat generous in giving it three stars out of five.",3,"Dissapointing sequel, but has some funny moments",1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,2473,"['Musclebear', 'Roger', 'twinkish', 'boyfriend', 'Tyler', 'who', 'became', 'couple', 'original', '2010', 'Bear', 'City', 'film', 'decide', 'take', 'advantage', 'NY', 'new', 'gay', 'marriage', 'bill', 'initial', 'misgivings', 'Tyler', 'part', 'most', 'friends', 'had', 'already', 'planned', 'be', 'Provincetown', 'Bear', 'Week', 'decided', 'hold', 'nuptuals', 'there', 'staying', 'guesthouse', 'owned', 'Rose', 'Kathy', 'Majimy', 'mother', 'friend', 'Brent', 'Stevem', 'Guarino', 'who', 'one', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'misguided', 'sequel', 'Lots', 'going', 'craziness', 'P-Town', 'including', 'Brent', 'partner', 'interviewing', 'attendees', 'bear', 'documentary', 'couple', 'making', 'plans', 'open', 'new', 'bear', 'bar', 'NYC.The', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'P-Town', 'tourist', 'promotion', 'local', 'attractions', 'huge', 'crowds', 'also', 'filled', 'marginal', 'gay', 'celebrities', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Frank', 'DeCaro', 'Jason', 'Stuart', 'Mike', 'Ruiz', 'Mark', 'Caruso', 'even', 'Lt.', 'Dan', 'Choi', 'making', 'seem', 'more', 'vanity', 'project', 'attempt', 'cohesive', 'story', 'do', 'learn', 'even', 'bear', 'community', 'element', 'discrimination', 'muscle', 'bears', 'more', 'portly', 'brethren', 'groups', 'are', 'equally', 'unable', 'be', 'monogamous', 'relationship', 'Tyler', 'chubby', 'bear', 'develop', 'connection', 'Roger', 'time', 'ex', 'previously', 'swore', 'never', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'suppose', 'illustrated', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'two', 'men', 'should', 'not', 'decide', 'get', 'married', 'simply', 'state', 'now', 'CAN', 'do', 'casting', 'issues', 'film', 'disjointed', 'terms', 'pacing', 'more', 'series', 'skits', 'telling', 'story', 'scenes', 'clearly', 'go', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'add', 'nothing', 'film', 'other', 'additional', 'minutes', 'funny', 'bits', 'are', 'milked', 'too', 'long', 'such', 'people', 'calling', 'Tyler', 'father', 'who', 'there', 'ceremony', 'Daddy', 'how', 'threesome', 'bears', 'door', 'really', 'large', 'bed', 'Most', 'assorted', 'disagreements', 'uncomfortable', 'confrontations', 'often', 'overshadow', 'camaraderie', 'bear', 'community', 'was', 'important', 'selling', 'point', 'original', 'film.DVD', 'making', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentary', 'music', 'videos', 'also', 'subtitled', '15', 'languages', 'Not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'heavy', 'R', 'sexual', 'content', 'No', 'nudity', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'generous', 'giving', 'three', 'five']",BearCity 2: The Proposal

I could go on and explain how the various actors disappointed me in the lack of development of these very interesting persons created in BEARCITY I; but I suspect that is not their fault as much as it is the fault of the writers.

(Note: a kiss from Bear City is now on YouTube)I love the movie Bear City, and recognized that a sequel would be created.
