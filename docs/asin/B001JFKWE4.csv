1206242,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B001JFKWE4,Bobby Underwood,"[76, 81]","If ever a star had that certain something which put him in the same category as those shining ones from the 1930's and 1940's, it was James Garner. He had a fine film career, to be sure, but it was his laconic charm as Jim Rockford on television with which he will always be most identified. He was an ex-con given a full pardon when it was discovered he was innocent after all. Working as a P.I. and parking his gold Firebird in front of his trailor on the L.A. beach, Rockford could never quite shake the ex-con tag, nor could he shake his old cellmate, Evelyn ""Angel"" Martin.Stuart Margolin was Angel, always looking for the easy buck, and getting his old buddy Jimmy into trouble with him. Neither Rockford or the viewing audience could stay mad at Angel for long, however, because in Margolin's hands, Angel was really a stand-up guy at heart and you had to admire his enthusiasm. Noah Beery, Jr. portrayed Rockford's lovable dad, Rocky, with equal aplomb.Rocky was an easygoing retired trucker who loved to fish, and passed on the hobby to Jim. Between the car chases, cons, and mad scrambles to stay out of jail were simple moments of life we all recognized from our own. It was that down to earth formula, coupled with Garner's charm and some excellent writing from Juanita Bartlett which kept Jim Rockford coming into our homes week after week for years. Rockford would only work on closed cases in an effort to avoid the cops which, of course, never quite worked out.Joe Santos was Rockford's often exasperated police pal, Dennis Becker. He was the buffer between Rockford and Becker's superiors, who in season 6 was James Luisi as Lt. Chapman. He hated Rockford and wanted any excuse to pull his P.I. license. Becker was a pal, but could only do so much for Jim as he had to stay out of hot water himself. He had a wife and kids to support, and for some strange reason, that sometimes took priority over helping his old buddy Jim out of a complicated jam. Beth was gone by this season, but Rita Moreno lit up the small screen as Rita Capkovic.Season 6 only had 12 episodes, but some really fine ones, and some terrific guest stars. Rockford got to go to Hawaii in one installment. In a way, looking back, as someone has already mentioned, it was sort of the changing of the guard type of season. Tom Selleck would reprise his role of Lance White, the detective so perfect it drove Rockford nuts! Larry Manetti would guest star on an episode as well. They would make Magnum P.I. a television staple the following year, and by the end of its long run, Joe Santos would star on that classic also.Season 6 episodes are: PARADISE COVE (MARIETTE HARTLEY) -- LIONS,TIGERS, MONKEYS AND DOGS (LAUREN BACALL--2 PARTER) -- ONLY ROCK AND ROLL WILL NEVER DIE (MARCIA STRASSMAN--2 PARTER) -- LOVE IS THE WORD -- NICE GUYS FINISH DEAD (TOM SELLECK) -- THE HAWAIIN HEADACHE -- THE NO-FAULT AFFAIR -- THE BIG CHEESE -- JUST A COUPLE OF GUYS -- DEADLOCK IN PARMAIt was only from December of 1979 through January of 1980 that we got to enjoy Mike Post's Rockford Files theme song, which only began after we'd heard one of those crazy messages on Jim's answering machine. It had only been a couple of years since Garner had finally gotten his Emmy Award for his fine portrayal of the affable Rockford. There is comfort food, and comfort television, and Rockford certainly falls into that category. A really fine television show worthy of its fan base.",5,A Good Friend Says Goodbye,1226188800,"11 9, 2008",2008,3442,"['ever', 'star', 'had', 'certain', 'something', 'put', 'same', 'category', 'shining', 'ones', '1930', '1940', 'was', 'James', 'Garner', 'had', 'fine', 'film', 'career', 'be', 'sure', 'was', 'laconic', 'charm', 'Jim', 'Rockford', 'television', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'most', 'identified', 'was', 'ex-con', 'given', 'full', 'pardon', 'when', 'was', 'discovered', 'was', 'innocent', 'Working', 'P.I', 'parking', 'gold', 'Firebird', 'front', 'trailor', 'L.A.', 'beach', 'Rockford', 'could', 'never', 'quite', 'shake', 'ex-con', 'tag', 'could', 'shake', 'old', 'cellmate', 'Evelyn', 'Angel', 'Martin.Stuart', 'Margolin', 'was', 'Angel', 'always', 'looking', 'easy', 'buck', 'getting', 'old', 'buddy', 'Jimmy', 'trouble', 'Rockford', 'viewing', 'audience', 'could', 'stay', 'mad', 'Angel', 'long', 'however', 'Margolin', 'hands', 'Angel', 'was', 'really', 'stand-up', 'guy', 'heart', 'had', 'admire', 'enthusiasm', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'Jr.', 'portrayed', 'Rockford', 'lovable', 'dad', 'Rocky', 'equal', 'aplomb.Rocky', 'was', 'easygoing', 'retired', 'trucker', 'who', 'loved', 'fish', 'passed', 'hobby', 'Jim', 'Between', 'car', 'chases', 'cons', 'mad', 'scrambles', 'stay', 'jail', 'were', 'simple', 'moments', 'life', 'recognized', 'own', 'was', 'down', 'earth', 'formula', 'coupled', 'Garner', 'charm', 'excellent', 'writing', 'Juanita', 'Bartlett', 'kept', 'Jim', 'Rockford', 'coming', 'homes', 'week', 'week', 'years', 'Rockford', 'would', 'only', 'work', 'closed', 'cases', 'effort', 'avoid', 'cops', 'course', 'never', 'quite', 'worked', 'out.Joe', 'Santos', 'was', 'Rockford', 'often', 'exasperated', 'police', 'pal', 'Dennis', 'Becker', 'was', 'buffer', 'Rockford', 'Becker', 'superiors', 'who', 'season', '6', 'was', 'James', 'Luisi', 'Lt.', 'Chapman', 'hated', 'Rockford', 'wanted', 'excuse', 'pull', 'P.I', 'license', 'Becker', 'was', 'pal', 'could', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'Jim', 'had', 'stay', 'hot', 'water', 'had', 'wife', 'kids', 'support', 'strange', 'reason', 'took', 'priority', 'helping', 'old', 'buddy', 'Jim', 'complicated', 'jam', 'Beth', 'was', 'gone', 'season', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'lit', 'up', 'small', 'screen', 'Rita', 'Capkovic.Season', '6', 'only', 'had', '12', 'episodes', 'really', 'fine', 'ones', 'terrific', 'guest', 'stars', 'Rockford', 'got', 'go', 'Hawaii', 'one', 'installment', 'way', 'looking', 'back', 'someone', 'already', 'mentioned', 'was', 'sort', 'changing', 'guard', 'type', 'season', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'would', 'reprise', 'role', 'Lance', 'White', 'detective', 'so', 'perfect', 'drove', 'Rockford', 'nuts', 'Larry', 'Manetti', 'would', 'guest', 'star', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'make', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'television', 'staple', 'following', 'year', 'end', 'long', 'run', 'Joe', 'Santos', 'would', 'star', 'classic', 'also.Season', '6', 'episodes', 'are', 'PARADISE', 'COVE', 'MARIETTE', 'HARTLEY', 'LIONS', 'TIGERS', 'MONKEYS', 'AND', 'DOGS', 'LAUREN', 'BACALL', '2', 'PARTER', 'ONLY', 'ROCK', 'AND', 'ROLL', 'WILL', 'NEVER', 'DIE', 'MARCIA', 'STRASSMAN', '2', 'PARTER', 'LOVE', 'THE', 'WORD', 'NICE', 'GUYS', 'FINISH', 'DEAD', 'TOM', 'SELLECK', 'HAWAIIN', 'HEADACHE', 'NO-FAULT', 'AFFAIR', 'BIG', 'CHEESE', 'JUST', 'COUPLE', 'OF', 'GUYS', 'DEADLOCK', 'IN', 'PARMAIt', 'was', 'only', 'December', '1979', 'January', '1980', 'got', 'enjoy', 'Mike', 'Post', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'theme', 'song', 'only', 'began', ""'d"", 'heard', 'one', 'crazy', 'messages', 'Jim', 'answering', 'machine', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'couple', 'years', 'Garner', 'had', 'finally', 'gotten', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'fine', 'portrayal', 'affable', 'Rockford', 'comfort', 'food', 'comfort', 'television', 'Rockford', 'certainly', 'category', 'really', 'fine', 'television', 'show', 'worthy', 'fan', 'base']",The Rockford Files: Season Six

The sixth season was short, just 12 episodes, and the big difference this time around (based on the first six episodes I have watched so far) is that there is a lot less action and a whole lot of monologuing by the characters.  I still enjoy the episodes because Garner is still charismatic, but it's easy to see that the show ended at a good time before it really had a chance to ruin its fine legacy.  Recommended but certainly not the place to start.  If you're going to watch the Rockford Files, watch the seasons in sequence.What follows includes a spoiler about the last episode!!!The final episode includes a scene where Rockford steals a police car (after pushing an officer to the floor) to catch a bad guy after which he apparently suffers no consequences.

1206248,A1A2B601H44F17,B001JFKWE4,Eddie Kasica,"[16, 32]","One of the greatest TV shows of all time ends with a sad whimper. Most of us Rockfordians are well aware of the problems between the wonderful James Garner and the corporate cavemen over at Universal, and right was certainly on Mr. Garner's side. However, this terrible tension and the exhaustion it caused -- beyond Garner already becoming tired of the role -- leads us to this final and cruddy 10-episode season. (Yes, you read that right: TEN EPISODES. For which, in classic Universal/MCA style, we are being charged a higher price than we were for the earlier full seasons!)Anyway, Jimbo huffs and puffs and whines and peeves and looks like he'd rather be doing anything other than reciting these tired old lines. How could he feel otherwise with this lineup?:""Lions, Tigers, Monkeys and Dogs"" -- Holy moly, and absolutely the bottom of the Rockford barrel. A wax museum in the form of a TV episode, this one ""stars"" everybody they could find from the Studio City Rest Home, including the great Lauren Bacall who in this two-part disaster can only be described as ""beige""(from head to toe). And the ""plot"" is worthy of the rest home: Bacall is a target for murder because she reminds her old high-school friend(now a princess) of their high school days. Really, I'm not kidding.""Love is the Word"" -- poor Jimmy, his old flame is getting married to someone else. Boo hoo. Steven Cannell would have thrown-up at this idea during the early seasons.""The Hawaiian Headache"" -- Rockford's old Korean commander, fresh from overthrowing Allende and assassinating Allard Lowenstein, shows up wanting Rockford's help in organizing Angolan death squads. Jim never liked the guy, so he says ""no"". Garner must have seen Reagan coming, I guess. Worthy of the bowels of ""24"".""No Fault Affair"" -- the great Rita Moreno appears for the last time as Rita Capkovic, asking the question that's stumped philosophers for thousands of years: is a 4th-rate hairdresser better than a 1st-rate hooker? (Of course not. Ask Charmane Star.) After watching this episode, you'll still be stumped.""The Big Cheese"" -- confused, anti-union propaganda, reportedly to have actually been written by Ed Meese. Throughout, Garner keeps checking his watch and his wallet.""Just a Coupla Guys"" -- Conigliaro & Long! Wasn't ""Jersey Bounce"" enough?? And are we supposed to forget that Eugene and Mickey were previously arrested for murder back in L.A.??? (Mickey is still picking sand from his teeth.)""Dreadlocks in Parma"" -- the Firebird breaks down and Jim finds himself stuck in a small town having a 3-day Bob Marley festival. Jim smokes a lot of weed, gets down with a serious fox by the name of Carrie Osgood, then leaves town. Okay, that's not the real plot but it's a lot sexier than Proposition 46D.This is Rockford so of course there are compensations. ""Nice Guys Finish Last""(already included in the Season Five set) is maybe the funniest episode of the entire series and one in which Garner is obviously having a hell of a time. ""Paradise Cove"" is also classic Rockford, beautifully written and acted. And parts of ""Only Rock and Roll Will Never Die"" is as good as anything from 1970s TV, particularly the great George Loros as Eddie and that moment between Garner and super-rocker Tim Ritchie. They're talking of high-school reunions and how wonderful Ritchie's must have been. ""A thousand-to-one shot,"" says Jim. ""Most guys show up overweight and feeling like failures."" ""Is that how you felt?,"" insensitive Tim asks Rockford. ""No. I like to keep myself in pretty good shape. And I've got my house on the beach. Big house on big wheels. Besides, I was in prison at the time. . .""A beautiful moment from a classic work of popular art going down for the count.",2,The Firebird Jumps the Shark,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,3732,"['One', 'greatest', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'sad', 'whimper', 'Most', 'Rockfordians', 'are', 'well', 'aware', 'problems', 'wonderful', 'James', 'Garner', 'corporate', 'cavemen', 'Universal', 'right', 'was', 'certainly', 'Mr.', 'Garner', 'side', 'However', 'terrible', 'tension', 'exhaustion', 'caused', 'Garner', 'already', 'becoming', 'tired', 'role', 'final', 'cruddy', '10-episode', 'season', 'Yes', 'read', 'right', 'TEN', 'EPISODES', 'classic', 'Universal/MCA', 'style', 'are', 'being', 'charged', 'higher', 'price', 'were', 'earlier', 'full', 'seasons', 'Anyway', 'Jimbo', 'huffs', 'puffs', 'whines', 'peeves', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'doing', 'anything', 'other', 'reciting', 'tired', 'old', 'lines', 'How', 'could', 'feel', 'otherwise', 'lineup', 'Lions', 'Tigers', 'Monkeys', 'Dogs', 'Holy', 'moly', 'absolutely', 'bottom', 'Rockford', 'barrel', 'wax', 'museum', 'form', 'TV', 'episode', 'one', 'stars', 'everybody', 'could', 'find', 'Studio', 'City', 'Rest', 'Home', 'including', 'great', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'who', 'two-part', 'disaster', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'beige', 'head', 'toe', 'plot', 'worthy', 'rest', 'home', 'Bacall', 'target', 'murder', 'old', 'high-school', 'friend', 'now', 'princess', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'Really', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'Love', 'Word', 'poor', 'Jimmy', 'old', 'flame', 'getting', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'Boo', 'hoo', 'Steven', 'Cannell', 'would', 'have', 'thrown-up', 'idea', 'early', 'seasons', 'Hawaiian', 'Headache', 'Rockford', 'old', 'Korean', 'commander', 'fresh', 'overthrowing', 'Allende', 'assassinating', 'Allard', 'Lowenstein', 'up', 'wanting', 'Rockford', 'help', 'organizing', 'Angolan', 'death', 'squads', 'Jim', 'never', 'liked', 'guy', 'Garner', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'Reagan', 'coming', 'guess', 'Worthy', 'bowels', '24', 'Fault', 'Affair', 'great', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'last', 'time', 'Rita', 'Capkovic', 'asking', 'question', 'stumped', 'philosophers', 'thousands', 'years', '4th-rate', 'hairdresser', 'better', '1st-rate', 'hooker', 'course', 'not', 'Ask', 'Charmane', 'Star', 'watching', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'stumped', 'Big', 'Cheese', 'confused', 'anti-union', 'propaganda', 'reportedly', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'written', 'Ed', 'Meese', 'Throughout', 'Garner', 'checking', 'watch', 'wallet', 'Just', 'Coupla', 'Guys', 'Conigliaro', 'Long', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Jersey', 'Bounce', 'enough', 'are', 'supposed', 'forget', 'Eugene', 'Mickey', 'were', 'previously', 'arrested', 'murder', 'back', 'L.A.', 'Mickey', 'still', 'picking', 'sand', 'teeth', 'Parma', 'Firebird', 'breaks', 'down', 'Jim', 'stuck', 'small', 'town', 'having', '3-day', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'festival', 'Jim', 'lot', 'weed', 'down', 'serious', 'fox', 'name', 'Carrie', 'Osgood', 'then', 'town', 'Okay', 'not', 'real', 'plot', 'lot', 'sexier', 'Proposition', '46D.This', 'Rockford', 'so', 'course', 'are', 'compensations', 'Nice', 'Guys', 'Finish', 'Last', 'already', 'included', 'Season', 'Five', 'set', 'maybe', 'funniest', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'Garner', 'obviously', 'having', 'hell', 'time', 'Paradise', 'Cove', 'also', 'classic', 'Rockford', 'beautifully', 'written', 'acted', 'parts', 'Only', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Will', 'Never', 'Die', 'as', 'good', 'anything', '1970s', 'TV', 'particularly', 'great', 'George', 'Loros', 'Eddie', 'moment', 'Garner', 'super-rocker', 'Tim', 'Ritchie', ""'re"", 'talking', 'high-school', 'reunions', 'how', 'wonderful', 'Ritchie', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'thousand-to-one', 'shot', 'Jim', 'Most', 'guys', 'show', 'up', 'overweight', 'feeling', 'failures', 'how', 'felt', 'insensitive', 'Tim', 'Rockford', 'No', 'like', 'keep', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', ""'ve"", 'got', 'house', 'beach', 'Big', 'house', 'big', 'wheels', 'was', 'prison', 'time', 'beautiful', 'moment', 'classic', 'work', 'popular', 'art', 'going', 'down', 'count']",The Rockford Files: Season Six

I can tell they cleaned up the picture pretty well, but the audio gets almost annoying. Thankfully it clears up after the first 10 mins.What I dont understand is, why didnt they just grab the VHS copy exsisting of the original uncut print for this one and clean it up?My other issue with this release is the menu. It looks very rushed, cheap and ALMOST like a home made bootlegg to be honest. You dont get the same style as on all the other seasons.Like smuthdude said, the syndication edits may be due to the fact of the fire at Universal destroying the original masters..so guess we can take that possibly into concideration, also its quite possible that the entire season 6 original prints were gone years ago, and these were all that was left.On season 5, I had noticed that ""Black Mirror"" was cleaned up and converted from a UK/PAL format video print with slightly pitched faster audio, if anyone realised that. But at least it was the original uncut!I woulda taken that format for the entire uncut season 6 vs what we got here but hey, like I said, im happy just to have it in any format. Cause as we know, the youngsters that run Universal didnt wanna release any Rockford after season 1 to begin with. So we are lucky!Bottom line, worth having to complete the series, but just dont expect the original NBC versions and the usual top DVD remastered quality.3 stars not for the content or show, but for the form we got it in.",3,Happy To Have Season 6..But...Why Like This??,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,1763,"['Im', 'shocked', 'reviewer', 'smuthdude', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'even', 'mentioned', 'noticed', 'are', 'edited', 'syndication', 'versions', 'quality', 'soso.On', 'Lions', 'Tigers', 'Monkeys', 'Dogs', 'was', 'fave', 'episode', 'final', 'season', 'audio', 'warped', 'first', '10', 'mins', 'so..like', 'dying', 'reel', 'reel', 'tape', 'can', 'tell', 'cleaned', 'up', 'picture', 'pretty', 'well', 'audio', 'almost', 'annoying', 'Thankfully', 'up', 'first', '10', 'mins.What', 'dont', 'understand', 'why', 'didnt', 'just', 'grab', 'VHS', 'copy', 'exsisting', 'original', 'uncut', 'print', 'one', 'clean', 'up', 'other', 'issue', 'release', 'menu', 'very', 'rushed', 'cheap', 'ALMOST', 'home', 'made', 'bootlegg', 'be', 'honest', 'dont', 'get', 'same', 'style', 'other', 'seasons.Like', 'smuthdude', 'said', 'syndication', 'edits', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'fact', 'fire', 'Universal', 'destroying', 'original', 'masters..so', 'guess', 'can', 'take', 'possibly', 'concideration', 'also', 'quite', 'possible', 'entire', 'season', '6', 'original', 'prints', 'were', 'gone', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'was', 'left.On', 'season', '5', 'had', 'noticed', 'Black', 'Mirror', 'was', 'cleaned', 'up', 'converted', 'UK/PAL', 'format', 'video', 'print', 'slightly', 'pitched', 'faster', 'audio', 'anyone', 'realised', 'least', 'was', 'original', 'uncut', 'woulda', 'taken', 'format', 'entire', 'uncut', 'season', '6', 'vs', 'what', 'got', 'here', 'hey', 'said', 'im', 'happy', 'just', 'have', 'format', 'Cause', 'know', 'youngsters', 'run', 'Universal', 'didnt', 'wan', 'release', 'Rockford', 'season', '1', 'begin', 'are', 'lucky', 'Bottom', 'line', 'worth', 'having', 'complete', 'series', 'just', 'dont', 'expect', 'original', 'NBC', 'versions', 'usual', 'top', 'DVD', 'remastered', 'quality.3', 'stars', 'not', 'content', 'show', 'form', 'got']",The Rockford Files: Season Six
1206253,A19YT97IYC101S,B001JFKWE4,"J. L. Alberti ""Just A Film Fan""","[4, 5]","The Final Season. Quite a Shame, acually. Watching this great series when it was first broadcast, I though Rockford was pretty cool. Smart enough to avoid a fight but, always willing to take 'em on if need be. Pretty humble and down to earth just like his dad. Always had respect for women and had decent relationships with decent women. I didn't know why at the time, I just remember it disappeared and it took me up to a couple of years ago to find out the behind the scenes drama that took place and how Universal was trying to give James Garner a shellacking when he had to stop production because of an injury. I won't go on about it (google it if you want the whole story), just suffice to say that things got settled and Universal even produced 8 TV movies twenty years later.To the set. 12 episodes and NO extras. Housed in the same digipak as the last few sets and having the same menus and options, nothing really much to say about it. As you've probably heard elsewhere, the TV movies are conspicuously missing. With only half a season they could have been added to round out the series and we wouldn't have to wait even longer to see them. To be honest I can't even remember if I saw them and just thought they were reruns or not.P.S. If you want to see a pre-Rockford performance that is so similar you want to believe it's the starting point for Jim Rockford, try and catch ""Marlow"". TCM shows it once and a while. Playing Ramond Chandler's character, he was updated to be contemporary at the time it was made (1969). A little cameo role in there for Bruce Lee for all you fans. Rita Moreno, a Rockford favorite is in there too.James Garner has always been a solid actor and makes you care for any character he plays. He usually plays a regular guy who has to rise above the situation around him and keep his dignity. You can put him right there with Randolph Scott, Gary Cooper and Gregory Peck as men you could look up to and respect for their craft.Anyway I completely recommend this. Since it's taken so much time to release all six seasons you can go back to the begining, after you finish this set, and watch them through again while you wait for the movies to be released.",5,A Shame It's Over,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,2193,"['Final', 'Season', 'Shame', 'acually', 'Watching', 'great', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'Rockford', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Smart', 'enough', 'avoid', 'fight', 'always', 'willing', 'take', ""'em"", 'need', 'be', 'Pretty', 'humble', 'down', 'earth', 'just', 'dad', 'Always', 'had', 'respect', 'women', 'had', 'decent', 'relationships', 'decent', 'women', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'time', 'just', 'remember', 'disappeared', 'took', 'up', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'find', 'out', 'scenes', 'drama', 'took', 'place', 'how', 'Universal', 'was', 'trying', 'give', 'James', 'Garner', 'shellacking', 'when', 'had', 'stop', 'production', 'injury', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'google', 'want', 'whole', 'story', 'just', 'suffice', 'say', 'things', 'got', 'settled', 'Universal', 'even', 'produced', '8', 'TV', 'movies', 'twenty', 'years', 'set', '12', 'episodes', 'extras', 'Housed', 'same', 'digipak', 'last', 'few', 'sets', 'having', 'same', 'menus', 'options', 'nothing', 'really', 'much', 'say', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'elsewhere', 'TV', 'movies', 'are', 'conspicuously', 'missing', 'only', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'round', 'out', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'even', 'longer', 'see', 'be', 'honest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'saw', 'just', 'thought', 'were', 'reruns', 'not.P.S', 'want', 'see', 'pre-Rockford', 'performance', 'so', 'similar', 'want', 'believe', 'starting', 'point', 'Jim', 'Rockford', 'try', 'catch', 'Marlow', 'TCM', 'once', 'while', 'Playing', 'Ramond', 'Chandler', 'character', 'was', 'updated', 'be', 'contemporary', 'time', 'was', 'made', '1969', 'little', 'cameo', 'role', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'fans', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'Rockford', 'favorite', 'too.James', 'Garner', 'always', 'been', 'solid', 'actor', 'care', 'character', 'usually', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'rise', 'situation', 'keep', 'dignity', 'can', 'put', 'right', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'men', 'could', 'look', 'up', 'respect', 'craft.Anyway', 'completely', 'recommend', 'taken', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'release', 'six', 'seasons', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'begining', 'finish', 'set', 'watch', 'through', 'again', 'wait', 'movies', 'be', 'released']",The Rockford Files: Season Six

Some scenes contain slight ghosting, rippling and tracking distortion problems consistant with aging videotape.  The color is faded, the contrast is poor and the focus is soft on nearly all episodes.  Why!? These obviously aren't the same crisp, clear prints used on seasons 1-5. Also, ""Lions Tigers Monkeys and Dogs"" is released here in two parts (like in syndication). It was released on VHS as a single two hour episode in the 90's.  Again, why?

since Universal had Rockford's 5th Season on DVD along with the fact that this was the last and final season of the ROCKFORD FILES since this season was cut short when NBC abruptly cancelled Rockford in the Winter of 1980 after only 10 episodes, due to James Garners chronic back and knee problems, which was similar to how and why CBS had cancelled the INCREDIBLE HULK all of the sudden in the middle of it's short-lived 5th Season back in November of 1981 after only 5 episodes, due to budget cuts and a change in management at CBS especially since the special effects on the INCREDIBLE HULK were becoming too expensive in the Hulk's last 2 seasons to keep running the show, because of the recession we had going on back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president.In other words, the ROCKFORD FILES and the INCREDIBLE HULK were both abruptly cancelled on such short notice, but weren't cancelled due to low ratings and both shows would've lasted longer and wouldn't have been cut so short if age hadn't caught up with James Garner and the Hulk wouldn't have been axed all of the sudden in the mid-Fall of 1981 if it wasn't for the all the budget restraints we had going on back then.Therefore, the ROCKFORD FILES Sixth Season was only half a season just like the INCREDIBLE HULK's Fifth Season was only an abbreviated season along with the fact that it coincidentally just so happens that both Rockford's final season and the Hulk's final season were both cut short, but for different reasons.Unfortunately, neither the ROCKFORD FILES or the INCREDIBLE HULK had a series finale episode which therefore lead us wondering for a while if Rockford(James Garner) had actually continued being a private investigator and if David Banner(Bill Bixby) ever really ended up finding a cure to his havoc infliction with the Hulk(Lou Ferrigno) along with the fact that the ROCKFORD FILES and the INCREDIBLE HULK were both cancelled without sufficient warning on top of that giving us reason to believe that Rockford and the Hulk obviously had some unfinished-business floating around.In addition to what contributed to Rockford's sudden cancellation, Garner ran out of steam & got burned out playing his Rockford character along with the fact that the ROCKFORD FILES started to become overshadowed by the DUKES OF HAZZARD when the Dukes made their debut on CBS in the Winter of 1979 which unfortunately interferred with the ROCKFORD FILES Friday night line-up on NBC which simply added fuel to the fire for Rockford since Rockford and the Dukes were shown at the same time-slot which was 9PM every Friday night which resulted in the DUKES OF HAZZARD stealing a lot of viewers away from the ROCKFORD FILES, because for one thing the Dukes were a lot funnier than Rockford was.For another, Bo and Luke Duke(John Schneider, Tom Wopat) were eye-candy and were more attractive and better looking than Rockford(James Garner) was since Bo and Luke were a lot younger and a lot more spunky than Rockford was along with the fact that Rockford was getting tired while John Schneider & Tom Wopat were both very young full of lots of pep, energy and years, unlike James Garner who was already becoming an old-fart as opposed to Tom Wopat and John Schneider who were obviously young-farts just getting to become major superstars in their showbiz career along with the fact that the DUKES OF HAZZARD was in its honeymoon phase of the show on top of that while the honeymoon phase of the ROCKFORD FILES was obviously already long gone with the Dukes practically beating Rockford to a pulp.Therefore you could say that John Schneider(Bo)and Tom Wopat(Luke) were peaking while James Garner(Rockford)was creaking since Rockford was huffing and puffing along while Bo and Luke were humming along.For another, the General Lee had outclassed Rockford's bronze Firebird, especially since the Dukes General Lee was a lot more flashy and a lot more upgraded than Rockford's Firebird was along with the fact that the General Lee was the hottest car on Friday nights at the time on top of that.Therefore, you could say that the DUKES OF HAZZARD had K.O.'d the ROCKFORD FILES in the Nielsen ratings and that the Dukes were killing Rockford, especially in the ratings department even though the ratings on Rockford were still high enough to start a 7th Season in the Fall of 1980, but there was no way that Rockford was able to compete with the Dukes either, especially since health problems forced Garner to quit doing this show.Therefore you could say that James Garner had reached a saturation point with his Rockford character and ran out of gas which resulted in the ROCKFORD FILES-6th Season becoming only half a season.Overall, for the record Rockford's short-lived 1979-1980 Season was still a great season and it still had some awesome guest stars like Mariette Hartley, Tom Selleck, and Larry Manetti, especially in the episode ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode when Rockford ends up reuniting with hot shot fellow gumshoe(Lance White) at a private eyes convention where Rockford ends up teaming up with the stellar Lance White again to help solve a senators murder that took place at the hotel where the private eyes convention was held at with the phenomenal Lance White stealing the show again by outclassing Rockford by making all the leads and finding all the clues and nearly tarnishing Rockford's reputation K.O.ing Rockford in the process just like the exceptional Lance White did in the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode in the previous season.It's just too bad Rockfords sexy attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett) couldn't be in this season either since Beth was abruptly dropped from the show during the second half of Rockford's 4th Season since Gretchen Corbett left the show in the Winter of 1978 due to a salary dispute with Universal which of course resulted in Beth being excluded from the show in the last 2 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES which therefore made things a little less intriguing & leaving us to still mourning the loss of Beth since Beth wasn't around anymore to be a buffer between Rockford and Becker's hard-nosed superior officer Lt. Chapman(James Luisi)a.k.a. ""Chappy"" in particular whenever Rockford was in hot water with the LAPD, unlike the case in the first 4 seasons.In addition to what makes the ROCKFORD FILES short-lived 6th Season so interesting is Rockford's 6th Season was also the season and year before the detective drama MAGNUM premiered on CBS back in December of 1980 and made Tom Selleck a superstar as well as a sex symbol, which practically made MAGNUM, P.I. a spin-off of the ROCKFORD FILES and HAWAII 5-0, especially since Tom Selleck did a couple of guest starring roles as the eccentric goody two-shoes private investigator(Lance White) on the ROCKFORD FILES before being a private investigator on his own show(MAGNUM, P.I.)along with the fact that the ROCKFORD FILES and MAGNUM were both private detective shows like MATT HOUSTON, MANNIX, and SIMON & SIMON all were.As a matter of fact, the idea and creation of the show MAGNUM, PI was inspired from THE ROCKFORD FILES, especially after Tom Selleck's 2 astonishing guest starring appearances as the inclusive private dick(Lance White)on THE ROCKFORD FILES.Therefore, it was almost like a preminition of Tom Selleck's days on MAGNUM along with the fact that Tom Selleck wasn't even famous yet when he guest starred on THE ROCKFORD FILES along with the fact that the ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode was my favorite episode from Rockford's Sixth Season and the ""White On White & Nearly Perfect"" episode was my favorite episode from Rockford's Fifth Season.It's just too bad that Tom Selleck's role as Thomas Magnum on MAGNUM, P.I. couldn't be as intelligent or as successful as his impeccable private detective(Lance White) role on the ROCKFORD FILES, because Magnum(Tom Selleck) used to get himself into just as much trouble and just as much mischief as Rockford(James Garner)did.It was also in interesting seeing guest stars like*Country Western singer Barbara Mandrell doing a cameo in the ""Love Is The Word"" episode*Mariette Hartley in the ""Paradise Cove"" episode before her co-starring days on ONE LIFE TO LIVE*Larry Mannetti in the ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode before his co-starring days as Thomas Magnum's often skeptical Navy buddy(Rick ""Orville"" Wright) on MAGNUM, P.I.*Jerry Douglas in the ""No Fault Affair"" episode during his co-starring days as John Abbott on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS*Sandra Kerns in the ""Deadlock In Parma"" episode before her co-starring days on CHARLES IN CHARGE*James Whitmore, Jr. in the ""Nice Guys Finish Dead"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & McCall's doofus fellow officer(Det. Bernie Terwilliger) on HUNTER*Award winning actress(Lauren Bacall)in the ""Lions, Tigers, Monkeys, & Dogs"" episode*Oscar nominee(Rita Moreno)making her recurring role as Rockford's former hooker buddy(Rita Capkovic)in ""The No Fault Affair"" episodeThis was also the last season with Joe Santos playing Rockford's overworked cop buddy(Det. Dennis Becker)which later co-starred in the last 2 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I. as Magnum's cop buddy(Lt. Nolan Page).It's just too bad that the ROCKFORD FILES had to be axed all of the sudden after NBC showed its last episode ""Deadlock In Parma"" on Thursday January 10, 1980, despite the fact that this was my 3rd favorite season throughout Rockfords whole 6-year run on NBC along with the fact that Rockford had inspired the premiere of newer detective shows from the 80's like MAGNUM, PI which made its debut on CBS in December of 1980 and SIMON & SIMON which debuted on CBS in the mid-Fall of 1981.In the meantime, I can hardly wait till Rockford's 6th Season gets released on DVD in January and I would highly recommend this DVD season to anybody who was a Rockford fan back in the 1970's like I was and/or to anyone who religiously watched the ROCKFORD FILES every Friday night when it was on NBC from 1974-80, but after reading more recent reviews on Rockford's Sixth Season DVD, I'm beginning to wonder if this DVD actually showed each 1979-80 Season episode complete & uncut like they were originally shown on their original air-dates on NBC or if Universal had actually went ahead and released this DVD with deleted scenes on each of these episodes like when they were shown in reruns on A&E;, TNN, TV Land, or WGN, and ME-TV, since one of the recent reviews indicated that this DVD didn't show the episodes complete & uncut and had a lot of scenes that were cut out which may have been due to a fire that errupted at the Universal movie company building in Universal City in the Summer of 2008.Additionally, now that Universal has released a complete series DVD of KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, and the INCREDIBLE HULK, I'm hoping to see Universal make a ROCKFORD FILES-The Complete Series DVD, since Rockford was a popular classic Universal TV show like KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, & the INCREDIBLE HULK all were.By the way, I've got some great interesting news for all you classic private detective drama fans out there to keep in mind for 2 new releases in the works for the Spring of 2010 since I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 out on DVD on Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and Shout will be releasing SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 out on DVD on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are now both available for pre-order online as we speak.",5,The Season Rockford Bit The Dust!,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,11577,"['time', 'Universal', 'got', 'short-lived',

Garner ultimately came out ahead but not the fans of ""The Rockford Files"" as there were only 12 episodes produced for the final season.Some old favorites return during the final season including Rita Moreno, Tom Sellick playing Lance White and others.Image quality is the same as the other sets; images particularly during the opening montage are a bit dirty and gritty looking and the episodes themselves have faded just a tad (the show was shot on 35mm film and without a full restoration there will always be some fading)but the shows themselves look surprisingly good despite the fact that no effort was put into restoring them and eliminating white dots, etc.It appears from the run time that these are the unedited original episodes and, because there are only 12 episodes included because the show was discontinued (it really never was offically cancelled)due to Garner's injuries (and, later, the lawsuit that Universal filed against Garner for not completing the last 9 episodes required by the contract--if they had been patient and hadn't tried to cheat him out of his profits I'm sure he would have considered returning for those episodes before discontinuing the series)the compression artifacts are kept to a minimum as there are four episodes per disc.Audio sounds pretty good for a vintage mono soundtrack with dialogue crystal clear. We get subtitles in English.Universal is selling the sixth season for the same price as seasons 1-5 which had TWICE as many episodes and we don't get ANY extras. The least Universal could have done was to include the first Rockford TV movie which featured Noah Berry Jr. in his last performance as a nice coda to this set. This is a solid season make no mistake about it but it never quite hit its stride simply because it was so darn short. Instead, fans of the series will have to buy the TV movies separately.Universal could have looked through their archieves for vintage promotional material but usually by the time a series has reached the last season you'll find less extras because the studio figures you're in for all the sets if you bought the previous five.The sixth season will be essential for fans but get it when when it is on sale or as a ""Buy 2 Get The Third Free"" sale.  The image quality varies from decent to extremely soft and it appears as if the syndicated versions were used for this set (unlike most of the previous seasons as near as I can tell).The quality of the writing during season six was pretty good overall and the show continued to show promise (luckily Garner did benefit from the counter lawsuit getting an undisclosed amount and the show according to the definitive book on the show had made over $100 million profit in syndication when Universal was STILL claiming it was 1.6 million in the red).For the moneyThe Rockford Files - Season One,The Rockford Files - Season Two,The Rockford Files - Season Three,The Rockford Files - Season Four,The Rockford Files - Season Fiveand the 90's TV movies gathered inThe Rockford Files: Movie Collection, Vol. 1--we haven't seen the Volume 2 set yet--might be better values.For more information about the difficulty in shooting the series and the later difficult legal journey that Garner made to collect the profits owed him readThirty Years of The Rockford Files: An Inside Look at America's Greatest Detective Seriesa comprehensive look at the show. Now if we could only get Warner to release ""Nichols"" (""The Rockford Files"" predecessor series which lasted one season which acted as a cross between ""Maverick"" and ""The Rockford Files"" at the turn-of-the-century )I'd be a happy camper.The image quality is pretty good for a nonrestored show, the episodes themselves quite good but, without any extras (even if there had been some) this set is overpriced since it only has 12 episodes.Still, for fans this is an essential set. Recommended (but try to get it on sale).",3,"Garner goes in for surgery and finds his wallet was removed...good but very short unexpected final season for ""Rockford""",1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,4288,"['James', 'Garner', 'required', 'knee', 'surgery', 'sixth', 'season', 'popular', 'series', 'discovered', 'Univeral', 'had', 'surgically', 'removed', 'wallet', 'studio', 'claimed', 'series', 'had', ""n't"", 'shown', 'profit', 'example', 'typical', 'studio', 'dubious', 'book', 'keeping', 'still', 'practiced', 'day', 'fact', 'was', 'red', 'Garner', 'shut', 'down', 'production', 'Universal', 'sued', 'breach', 'contract', 'Garner', 'ultimately', 'came', 'out', 'ahead', 'not', 'fans', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'were', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'produced', 'final', 'season.Some', 'old', 'return', 'final', 'season', 'including', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'Tom', 'Sellick', 'playing', 'Lance', 'White', 'others.Image', 'quality', 'same', 'other', 'sets', 'images', 'particularly', 'opening', 'montage', 'are', 'bit', 'dirty', 'gritty', 'looking', 'episodes', 'have', 'faded', 'just', 'tad', 'show', 'was', 'shot', '35mm', 'film', 'full', 'restoration', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'fading', 'shows', 'look', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'fact', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'restoring', 'eliminating', 'white', 'dots', 'etc.It', 'run', 'time', 'are', 'unedited', 'original', 'episodes', 'are', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'included', 'show', 'was', 'discontinued', 'really', 'never', 'was', 'offically', 'cancelled', 'due', 'Garner', 'injuries', 'later', 'lawsuit', 'Universal', 'filed', 'Garner', 'not', 'completing', 'last', '9', 'episodes', 'required', 'contract', 'had', 'been', 'patient', 'had', ""n't"", 'tried', 'cheat', 'profits', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'considered', 'returning', 'episodes', 'discontinuing', 'series', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'are', 'four', 'episodes', 'disc.Audio', 'sounds', 'pretty', 'good', 'vintage', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'dialogue', 'crystal', 'clear', 'get', 'subtitles', 'English.Universal', 'selling', 'sixth', 'season', 'same', 'price', 'seasons', '1-5', 'had', 'TWICE', 'many', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'ANY', 'extras', 'least', 'Universal', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'include', 'first', 'Rockford', 'TV', 'movie', 'featured', 'Noah', 'Berry', 'Jr.', 'last', 'performance', 'nice', 'coda', 'set', 'solid', 'season', 'make', 'mistake', 'never', 'quite', 'hit', 'stride', 'simply', 'was', 'so', 'darn', 'short', 'Instead', 'fans', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'buy', 'TV', 'movies', 'separately.Universal', 'could', 'have', 'looked', 'archieves', 'vintage', 'promotional', 'material', 'usually', 'time', 'series', 'reached', 'last', 'season', ""'ll"", 'find', 'less', 'extras', 'studio', 'figures', ""'re"", 'sets', 'bought', 'previous', 'five.The', 'sixth', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'essential', 'fans', 'get', 'when', 'when', 'sale', 'Buy', '2', 'Get', 'Third', 'Free', 'sale', 'image', 'quality', 'varies', 'decent', 'extremely', 'soft', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'were', 'used', 'set', 'most', 'previous', 'seasons', 'as', 'can', 'tell', '.The', 'quality', 'writing', 'season', 'six', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'show', 'continued', 'show', 'promise', 'luckily', 'Garner', 'did', 'benefit', 'counter', 'lawsuit', 'getting', 'undisclosed', 'amount', 'show', 'according', 'definitive', 'book', 'show', 'had', 'made', '100', 'million', 'profit', 'syndication', 'when', 'Universal', 'was', 'STILL', 'claiming', 'was', '1.6', 'million', 'red', '.For', 'moneyThe', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Season', 'One', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Season', 'Two', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Season', 'Three', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Season', 'Four', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Season', 'Fiveand', '90', 'TV', 'movies', 'gathered', 'inThe', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'Vol', '1', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Volume', '2', 'set', 'yet', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'values.For', 'more', 'information', 'difficulty', 'shooting', 'series', 'later', 'difficult', 'legal', 'journey', 'Garner', 'made', 'collect', 'profits', 'owed', 'readThirty', 'Years', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Inside', 'Look', 'America', 'Greatest', 'Detective', 'Seriesa', 'comprehensive', 'look', 'show', 'Now', 'could', 'only', 'get', 'Warner', 'release', 'Nichols', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'predecessor', 'series', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'acted', 'cross', 'Maverick', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'turn-of-the-century', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'camper.The', 'image', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'nonrestored', 'show', 'episodes', 'quite', 'good', 'extras', 'even', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'overpriced', 'only', '12', 'episodes.Still', 'fans', 'essential', 'set', 'Recommended', 'try', 'get', 'sale']",The Rockford Files: Season Six
1206272,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B001JFKWE4,William Smith,"[6, 8]","A lot can be said for Classic TV versus the modern stuff. I've gotten my feet wet with the never ending story arcs on the shores of LOST, I've also watched a show so slow to blossom that I had to be reminded it contained HEROES.But then there is Jim Rockford. An immediate force. An immediate friend.There is something very compelling about the way he lives. He lives cheaply but never quite gets out from under. He's close to his dad but not close enough to listen to him:) It's no small wonder we love him, he's us, and I think that's why we tuned in.While brief, I find this season never lacking in the important areas; wit, charm, and chemistry. The powers that be truly seemed to have a knack at casting the guest stars straight through to the folks that would meet their end.. to this end I would like to mention the price is a bit too high for season too short, but I am willing to let it slide.I would love to give major props to Universal for keeping the artwork and packaging consistent and beautiful for the entire run of The Rockford Files. The discs thankfully throughout have been single-sided and glitch-free, and coming from Universal, that's an achievement.. Now, keep those Files open by continuing with the TV Movies.",5,Farewell Jimbo,1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,1236,"['lot', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Classic', 'TV', 'modern', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'feet', 'wet', 'never', 'ending', 'story', 'arcs', 'shores', 'LOST', ""'ve"", 'also', 'watched', 'show', 'so', 'slow', 'blossom', 'had', 'be', 'reminded', 'contained', 'HEROES.But', 'then', 'Jim', 'Rockford', 'immediate', 'force', 'immediate', 'friend.There', 'something', 'very', 'compelling', 'way', 'cheaply', 'never', 'quite', 'out', 'close', 'dad', 'not', 'close', 'enough', 'listen', 'small', 'wonder', 'love', 'think', 'why', 'tuned', 'in.While', 'brief', 'find', 'season', 'never', 'lacking', 'important', 'areas', 'wit', 'charm', 'chemistry', 'powers', 'be', 'truly', 'seemed', 'have', 'knack', 'casting', 'guest', 'stars', 'straight', 'folks', 'would', 'meet', 'end..', 'end', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'price', 'bit', 'too', 'high', 'season', 'too', 'short', 'am', 'willing', 'let', 'slide.I', 'would', 'love', 'give', 'major', 'props', 'Universal', 'keeping', 'artwork', 'packaging', 'consistent', 'beautiful', 'entire', 'run', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'discs', 'thankfully', 'have', 'been', 'single-sided', 'glitch-free', 'coming', 'Universal', 'achievement..', 'Now', 'keep', 'Files', 'open', 'continuing', 'TV', 'Movies']",The Rockford Files: Season Six
