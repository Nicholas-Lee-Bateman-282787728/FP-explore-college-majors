Now I know Freddie Mercury didn't make this band what it is alone!  OMG...Brian May and Roger Taylor are great musicians and great vocalists as well bringing back to life some old rememberable songs such as 39 and I'm In Love With My Car!  And then there's Paul Rogers...wow, what singing!!!  He does The Queen songs justice!  Plus we also get a bunch of songs from his Bad Company catalog that I've never heard live before being Shooting Star and the song Bad Company itself which sound even better with Queen backing him up!!!  All in all the concert is over 2 hours long and well worth the price!  Hell, I bought this at Best Buy for $11.99 which include 3 discs...2 audio and 1 video!  What a deal!  I can't express how good this concert is!  You better watch it and decide for yourself!  If you grew up in the 70's and was a fan of Queen, Bad Company and Free....you won't be disappointed!",5,Old School Rock And Roll Gets Jolted Back To Life!!!,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,1010,"['Holy', 'Excitement', 'what', 'concert', 'performance', 'concert', 'made', 'think', 'Queen', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'Now', 'know', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'band', 'what', 'alone', 'OMG', 'Brian', 'May', 'Roger', 'Taylor', 'are', 'great', 'musicians', 'great', 'vocalists', 'as', 'well', 'bringing', 'back', 'life', 'old', 'rememberable', 'songs', 'such', '39', ""'m"", 'Love', 'My', 'Car', 'then', 'Paul', 'Rogers', 'wow', 'what', 'singing', 'Queen', 'songs', 'justice', 'also', 'get', 'bunch', 'songs', 'Bad', 'Company', 'catalog', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'live', 'being', 'Shooting', 'Star', 'song', 'Bad', 'Company', 'sound', 'even', 'better', 'Queen', 'backing', 'up', 'concert', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'well', 'price', 'Hell', 'bought', 'Best', 'Buy', '11.99', 'include', '3', 'discs', '2', 'audio', '1', 'video', 'What', 'deal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'how', 'good', 'concert', 'better', 'watch', 'decide', 'grew', 'up', '70', 'was', 'fan', 'Queen', 'Bad', 'Company', 'Free', '.you', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

The rawness of this concert is fresh and full of energy, Paul Rodgers's vocals are emaculate and  really does justice to Queen songs as well as his Bad. Company tracks. every Musician is at their peak in this show, but then again if you were to have over 350,000 screaming fans in one venue you would want to be at your best, plus having that much adrenaline flowing through you with that big of a audience present.

I must admit I was one of the millions who thought this was a weird/bad idea when I first heard of this meeting and after their initial live DVD plus recent album and oh...I did see them live ....I have never been so happy to be wrong!
