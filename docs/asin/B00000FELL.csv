In these videos, Michael Wood unfolds the journey that Alexander took nearly 2,500 years ago.  This effort, alongside his IN SEARCH OF THE TROJAN WAR has distinguished Wood as the Carl Sagan of classical history.In this documentary we're able to view the sundry places that the Macedonian visited, conquered and cherished in his journey into history.  The number of countries that he travelled thru are innumerable, including what is modern day Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Isreal, Afghanistan, Syria, India + many, many more.  Some of the topography has scarcely changed in the intermittant years, while in other places the scenery has changed quite a bit.  The former examples are of more interest, for it engages the viewer to imagine himself marching alongside the legendary General!Along the way, Wood carries with him his trusty CAMPAIGNS OF ALEXANDER by the Greek historian Arrian.  Wood also consults the local folklore of the denizens who have descended from the very people who fought for and against Alexander.  Looking at the mythology of the man from several cultural viewpoints enhances our understanding of his significance in & around Asia Minor.Although there is a great deal of information that is offered about the travels of Alexander, precious little detail is given on his tactics and strategies of battle.  Also, almost nothing is said of his father, Phillip II, or the historical background of Alexander's rise to glory.  For a documentary that covers the former topic, I would recommend ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND THE BATTLE OF ISSUS.  For studies of the historical backdrop of Alexander's life, consider MACEDONIA:  THE LAND OF A GOD (parts I & II) as well as the writings of Isocrates.  All 3 of these may be found @ Amazon.com.As a sidenote, Wood's trek thru Afghanistan may be of particular interest in regards to recent developments.  Wood went thru in 1996, just as the Taliban was asserting control over the country.  One can see just how chaotic & dangerous life in that country was and is.According to legend, when Julius Caesar was around 30, he wept at the feet of a statue of Alexander.  Caesar was overwhelmed by the fact that Alexander had conquered almost all the known world by the time he was 30, while Caesar had done so relatively little in comparison.  Caesar spent the rest of his life symbolically attempting to re-trace the steps of Alexander's conquests.  Here we have an opportunity to literally retrace the steps of the man the Romans posthumously annointed as Alexander ""the Great.""

My favourite episode is number 3, where the landscape gets more and more alien as time goes on. It is incredible to think of Greek armies in the monsoons of the tropics! There are downsides, though. I would have preferred more panoramic views. It is rather dissatifying to see the place of the Battle of Issus, without having time to actually look at the place. Just a brief sweep of the landscape would have been enough.  Also, the amount of detail is uneven. Only two battles were covered in any depth. I would have preferred to have more, and in greater detail. It would have been more exciting to the viewer.

500267,A2RNU49OEH8L9W,B00000FELL,"Jason S. Taylor ""Marco's Realto""","[0, 0]","Few more curious figures exist in history then Alexander the Eccentric. He was a man of almost superhuman talent; and yet he did little with it other then to narcissistically demonstrate it over and over. His men loved him with the almost erotic fervor given to successful commanders in the past(a fervor that is hard to understand in our age when battlefields are to complicated to control by theatrical heroics). And yet Alexander, for years, couldn't be bothered to give his men the greatest gift in his power-simply letting them go home. His life was a true epic that was anomalous even in his own time. And yet it's sheer uselessness seems impossible to give credit to. That is of course looking at it from our point of view when we expect rulers to at least pretend that they are acting for the material benefit of their states. The fact is he achieved what he set out to do. There are rationalizations about his hidden motives but he said that he desired to take vengeance on Persia, gain glory, and prove himself a mighty warrior. And assuming hidden motives is not necessary; his actions are most easily interpreted by the assumption that these in fact were his primary goals. He did few actions that would indicate more then a passing desire to make new laws, patronize scholarship, found a civilization or the other things ""Great"" kings are supposed to do. When he did such things it was almost by accident. He set out to be a mighty warrior; and that at least he accomplished in spades.Michael Wood sets out on his own epic following the march of Alexander's army as it set out on it's journey from Greece to India and back, a journey that is still uncomfortable and dangerous enough to be recognized by travellers of old. He passes the glorious cities on the Silk Road, and interviews storytellers, villagers, tribesmen, traders, and warriors, who have changed surprisingly little except for technology. He listens to Alexandrian legends along the way, as he shares in the hospitality of the locals. All this is done with splendid video footage, and gives a picture not just of Alexander but of a whole world that haunts our imaginations still.Michael seems to show a hero-worship for Alexander that is almost like that of a Macedonian pikeman. Of course he is not blind to his faults; but then neither were all Macedonians. This is not surprising; Alexander did have a hypnotic personality, and did have the virtues that heroes of epics always have had. Alexander was not a hero in the modern sense which is inseparable from moral judgement. He was certainly a hero in the Ancient Greek sense; a powerful figure who inspires awe with his achievement, even if his achievements were barren and destructive. And yet the ironic fact is that Alexander for all his attractive qualities followed his journey in what was in essence a large scale act of banditry. Michael Wood followed this same journey-less hard but hard enough-to bring knowledge and pleasure to ordinary people who watch it. Perhaps it is he that is the more heroic of the two.",5,Great Work,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,3052,"['Few', 'more', 'curious', 'figures', 'exist', 'history', 'then', 'Alexander', 'Eccentric', 'was', 'man', 'almost', 'superhuman', 'talent', 'yet', 'did', 'little', 'other', 'then', 'narcissistically', 'demonstrate', 'men', 'loved', 'almost', 'erotic', 'fervor', 'given', 'successful', 'commanders', 'past', 'fervor', 'hard', 'understand', 'age', 'when', 'battlefields', 'are', 'complicated', 'control', 'theatrical', 'heroics', 'yet', 'Alexander', 'years', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'give', 'men', 'greatest', 'gift', 'power-simply', 'letting', 'go', 'home', 'life', 'was', 'true', 'epic', 'was', 'anomalous', 'even', 'own', 'time', 'yet', 'sheer', 'uselessness', 'impossible', 'give', 'credit', 'course', 'looking', 'point', 'view', 'when', 'expect', 'rulers', 'least', 'pretend', 'are', 'acting', 'material', 'benefit', 'states', 'fact', 'achieved', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'are', 'rationalizations', 'hidden', 'motives', 'said', 'desired', 'take', 'vengeance', 'Persia', 'gain', 'glory', 'prove', 'mighty', 'warrior', 'assuming', 'hidden', 'motives', 'not', 'necessary', 'actions', 'are', 'most', 'easily', 'interpreted', 'assumption', 'fact', 'were', 'primary', 'goals', 'did', 'few', 'actions', 'would', 'indicate', 'more', 'then', 'passing', 'desire', 'make', 'new', 'laws', 'patronize', 'scholarship', 'found', 'civilization', 'other', 'things', 'Great', 'kings', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'When', 'did', 'such', 'things', 'was', 'almost', 'accident', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'mighty', 'warrior', 'least', 'accomplished', 'spades.Michael', 'Wood', 'out', 'own', 'epic', 'following', 'march', 'Alexander', 'army', 'set', 'out', 'journey', 'Greece', 'India', 'back', 'journey', 'still', 'uncomfortable', 'dangerous', 'enough', 'be', 'recognized', 'travellers', 'old', 'glorious', 'cities', 'Silk', 'Road', 'interviews', 'storytellers', 'villagers', 'tribesmen', 'traders', 'warriors', 'who', 'have', 'changed', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'technology', 'Alexandrian', 'legends', 'way', 'shares', 'hospitality', 'locals', 'done', 'splendid', 'video', 'footage', 'picture', 'not', 'just', 'Alexander', 'whole', 'world', 'imaginations', 'still.Michael', 'show', 'hero-worship', 'Alexander', 'almost', 'Macedonian', 'pikeman', 'course', 'not', 'blind', 'faults', 'then', 'were', 'Macedonians', 'not', 'surprising', 'Alexander', 'did', 'have', 'hypnotic', 'personality', 'did', 'have', 'virtues', 'heroes', 'epics', 'always', 'have', 'had', 'Alexander', 'was', 'not', 'hero', 'modern', 'sense', 'inseparable', 'moral', 'judgement', 'was', 'certainly', 'hero', 'Ancient', 'Greek', 'sense', 'powerful', 'figure', 'who', 'awe', 'achievement', 'even', 'achievements', 'were', 'barren', 'destructive', 'yet', 'ironic', 'fact', 'Alexander', 'attractive', 'qualities', 'followed', 'journey', 'what', 'was', 'essence', 'large', 'scale', 'act', 'banditry', 'Michael', 'Wood', 'followed', 'same', 'journey-less', 'hard', 'hard', 'enough-to', 'bring', 'knowledge', 'pleasure', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'heroic', 'two']",In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great VHS

500270,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00000FELL,Lleu Christopher,"[6, 7]","In this combination travel guide and history lesson, Michael Wood takes a 20,000 mile journey retracing the steps of the great conqueror Alexander the Great. One of the things that makes this so interesting is that the lands Wood passes through are just as dangerous now as they were in Alexander's time. The video came out in 1998; in the West, we may think of that as a safer time, but many of the places on this map have been in a state of war almost throughout recorded history. Afghanistan, for example, was in the middle of a civil war and Wood was warned by a guide that their lives were in danger as they passed through rugged mountains. In addition to war, of course, nature itself poses a threat in the form of mountain-slides, harsh deserts and extremes of temperature.As for Alexander, though we know many of the facts of his journey and the many lands he conquered, many things remain disputed. Wood mentions ancient historians such as Arrian, who themselves were writing long after the actual events. It is fascinating how legends of Alexander persist in this part of the world, from Iran to India, passed down not in books but orally from one generation to the next. For the people in these regions, many who live lives not very different from their ancestors in Alexander's day, more than 2000 years ago, history is not abstract but a part of daily life. In the video, for example, we see Iranian storytellers dramatically recounting events of Alexander's time. The diverse sights, scenery and people of these regions alone make the video worth watching.Alexander appears to have been driven initially by a desire for revenge against the Persian empire, which had long been an enemy of the Macedonians. As other reviewers have pointed out, Wood unfortunately uses Greek and Macedonian interchangeably, which is not accurate. When Alexander came to power, in fact, the Greek states such as Athens were hostile to him and saw him as a threat. This is such an obvious mistake, you'd think someone would have edited it out, but overall it's a minor quibble.At times Wood seems overcome with hero worship of Alexander, which makes him an enthusiastic if somewhat biased narrator. He does not shirk, however, from recounting some of Alexander's atrocities. Alexander appears to have been a complex and volatile individual who could be generous and magnanimous and at other times vicious and vindictive. Yet he was always a great leader and military commander (if at times lucky) who inspired his army to the most difficult tasks. Michael Wood and his crew follow some of the Macedonian army's difficult treks up mountains and through deserts, but at other times they are transported by jeeps and trains. We can imagine the difficulty encountered by Alexander's army --thousands of people making these journeys entirely on foot or horseback.Alexander the Great is one of the pivotal figures of ancient history. His campaigns helped break down the barriers dividing East and West.

This documentary is not meant to dissect Alexander's persona through exhaustive historical accounting or through scholarly discussions.  It simply tries to impart a small part of Alexander's character by showing what tremendous hardships he and his army endured and overcame, on their way from Macedonia to India. It retraces his footsteps not his being.Though it does not necessarily explore the man, it does impart some insights. It shows a man of deep passions, perseverance, endurance, hardiness, foolhardiness, intelligence, a military genius with luck on his side and the possessor of a will of iron.  In short, he definitely was a man of mettle and one who changed the course of the world and shaped the thoughts of men for generations to come.His journeys are re-traced step-by-step through the various territories he conquered.  The battle strategies are not discussed in depth.  Some are outlined in passing but they do paint a picture of a man who would not be denied and who could lead men by his willpower alone.  In short, this is a terrific documentary though it is somewhat one dimmentional. But it is meant to be that way as the title suggests. It is of extreme interest to see how Alexander ""Zul-Quarnain's"" story has remained vividly alive in the various conquered regions of old and how the man and the myth continue to survive to this day.  For a more thorough historical framework and objective discussion, try several well written texts especially the one by Peter Green.

In this excellently shot and actually quite fun documentary British historian Michael Wood takes the viewer through a massive journey starting in Macedonia through a myriad of modern nations such as Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan and India and somehow manages to meld the entire thing into a coherent whole. With extensive use of ancient sources and by humanising the story by focussing on the character of the main players - Alexander above all - Wood makes this double video spanning 238 minutes seem much shorter than it really is because the viewer is bombarded not only with snippets of facts but also by the actual vastness of the geographical area in question.Of course there weren't exactly CNN film crews embedded with the units of Alexanders army back in the day so there remains a certain amount of conjecture about many of the thoughts of Alexander himself. After all fate did not bestow upon him an old age wherein he may have set down his memoirs (as it were). But Wood is quite skilful in trying to put himself into the shoes of Alexander and those who followed him and what I quite enjoyed was his total desire to explore not just the factual aspects but also the myths and legends that have grown up around one of the worlds greatest conquerors. And he doesn't just stop at written accounts but also speaks to locals about stories that have been passed down innumerable generations to the present day about the man.An excellent primer for sure. In fact IMHO this will probably contain everything most people would ever want to know about Alexander. On the other hand it inspired me to further my research and I ended up buying Michael Woods accompanying book as well as a couple of the ancient texts he so openly uses during his journey.In terms of enjoyment this is probably my favourite work by Wood and it's a credit not only to him but everyone else who worked on putting this together from top to bottom.",5,What a journey.

This was after having endured the recently released film disaster of the same name by Oliver Stone.  Having earlier watched another of Michael Wood's documentaries, the delightful ""The Conquistadores"", I was willing to gamble on Mr. Wood's skills as a storyteller a second time.  My gamble paid off.As a trained historian and history teacher, I was again impressed by Mr. Wood's attention to detail and accuracy.  Not once in four hours of viewing, could I jump out of my seat, play the pedant, and shout ""Ah Ha!, he is wrong on this point!""And the cinematography!  I was as riveted by the beauty of the landscapes as I was the engaging and often humorous commentary of the host.  ""In the Footsteps.."" deserves kudos for presenting the often desolate parts of the world its subject experienced as haunting and beautiful in their own right.Wood's supreme gift, however, is his ability to tell a riveting story.  And to tell it in such a warm and affable way as to convey the impression he was sharing it with me personally.  It was together we traveled the Hindu Kush, tramped through the snow capped  mountains of Macedonia, and sat huddled with tea drinking Iranians, listening to the tales of ""Sikandur"", the horned one. Mr. Wood's intention is not to persuade, but instead to educate and stimulate debate.  My only regret is that the series was not longer.  Whatever happened to the fruits of Alexander's labors and the labors of his men?

500278,A2K3UTNW0783U6,B00000FELL,Phillip Kay,"[22, 24]","This is a superb presentation which has, nevertheless, some flaws. Segment one, which tells the story of Alexander's youth and the launch of the great expedition, gives due credit to Alexander's father, Philip II, as strategist and politician, but fails to mention that Philip planned the expedition to conquer Persia, raised an army and its supply lines and had a route mapped out. He was murdered just before he was due to leave Macedonia. Alexander was able to move so quickly because the work had been already prepared by Philip. Wood gives the impression that Persia was Alexander's idea. Wood also fails to emphasise enough Alexander's rivalry with Philip. A brilliant and commanding personality, Alexander spent his youth being eclipsed by his father's achievements, and it made him furious to excel Philip. This rivalry was cultivated by his mother Olympias, who had been set aside by Philip and would not accept it. The murder of Philip was most likely organised by Olympias, with Alexander's connivance.Segment two, which deals with the conquest of Darius, fails to mention that Darius was an usurper who did not command the allegiance of his nobles and their forces. To be exact, an ambitious eunuch removed the legitimate heir and used Darius, who was of the royal house and of an impressive appearance, as a pawn through whom he could rule the empire. This was not accepted by the nobles, and if Alexander had not come it is likely the empire would have broken up in civil wars unless another Darius the Great had emerged. This explains why the Persian army was so ineffective, with whole divisions not engaging or deserting during combat. Alexander was fighting an already beaten enemy. These two instances lessen Alexander's achievement but make it much more understandable.Segments three and four, on the circuit of the empire and arrival at India, return and death, are more of a travelogue, recounting surviving folklore in a leisurely way while reflecting on the possible collapse of Alexander's character through excess. It gave me the feeling that Wood was running out of steam, filling up his allotted time with lesser material.On the positive side Wood illuminates Alexander's deeds and character by experiencing the same terrain as Alexander did, and in some instances sheds light on Alexander's actions. Wood is, as always, scholarly, and engaging, prompting audience involvement.As a whole the documentary reinforces the myth, while highlighting aspects of it unknown to western audiences. It's a populist, and amazing, travelogue. For some reason Wood refers to Hercules (the Roman god) throughout, not Herakles (the Greek god). Alexander?

Citing excerpts from ancient Greek and Roman historians, Woods literally treks, rides, swims and sails in Alexander's  footsteps.  Passing through at least four war zones, Wood observes that these regions remain ""on the fault lines of history.""  No kidding.  Along the way, Wood encounters local story tellers who perform ancient recitations that keep Alexander's story alive and current.  For instance, in Iran there's still resentment of Alexander as conqueror of the Persian empire.This exciting, engrossing documentary is loaded with numerous incidents rich in irony that puts in clearer perspective not only the world of Alexander (300 BC) but our modern, fractured world.

Little is said however concerning his early years in Greece and his development under his father King Philip. Nothing is shown concerning his early campaigns in Greece, his sacking of Thebes and his pivotal part in the battle of Chronea in 338 BC.  The first major battle at the Granicus  in 332  BC after landing at the Hellespoint is also skipped over for some reason.  Despite these failings, Michael Wood provides a fascinating and energetic account of Alexander's route of conquest.  His enthusiam for the topic is evident throughout, and many fascinating people and places are shown. His use of the primary sources of Alexander make for interesting comparisons concerning description and reality.  To read what old sources say, and to try and make sense of them by traveling to see for oneself is one of the most compelling aspects of historical travel.The folklore and legends of Alexander in the various regions of the East that he passed through becomes evident in watching this work.  This is more a travelers history of Alexander.  Those desiring some insight into his battles may be somewhat disappointed here.  In my opinion more attention could have been given to this aspect of Alexander's career.  His generalship is one of the most concrete elements we have concerning his style of leadership and deserves greater attention here.  His two earlier battles as noted above are skipped over, and even Issus, Gaugamela and Hydaspes receive only scant mention.  Still, I can't fault this work totally for these omissions.  What we have is still an epic account of his travels and how these places and people appear today.One comes away from viewing this travelogue with a new respect for Alexander's sheer force of will to conquer so many varied regions and peoples.

Macedonians responded by picking 300 mountaineers to do just that.This documentary is incredible! Historian Michael Wood retraces Alexander the Great's footsteps over 20,000 miles of harsh terrain: desert, tropics, mountains.  A pilgrimage for only the physically fit!  It's hard to imagine how the Macedonian army managed without modern conveniences, cars, ac, radio!  What's so great about this film is how Michael Wood makes you relive Alexander's feats, and he retells the most notable stories of his life with such enthusiasm.Wood quotes from two ancient historians, preferring Arrian over Curtius.  Probably, Curtius' description of crucifixions all along the coast of Syria and Lebanon is true.  Crucifixion originated with the Persians, the Romans perfected its cruelty.  I was a little disappointed that he didn't use other references like Josephus or the Bible, (see Daniel 2, 7, 8, 11 about prophecies of the Greeks).  In Daniel 8:5-8:8, Alexander/Greece is depicted as a goat whose feet do not touch the ground reflecting the Greeks' swiftness/athletic prowess.  In 8:8, the Bible says of him that he ""magnified himself exceedingly, and when he was strong, he was broken"".  He died at age 33 in ancient Babylon, by the banks of the Euphrates.  The jews did see Alexander as a liberator and their relations with him were good (see Josephus' The Antiquities of the Jews Book 11, Chapter 8, 5 about Alexander's vision of the jew's high priest at Dios, Macedonia).  Alexander tells Parmenio, his general, ""But that God (Israel's) exhorted me to make no delay...for that He would conduct my army, and give me dominion over the Persians...and remembering that vision...I believe I bring this army under the divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius (III), and destroy the power of the Persians.""  The high priest showed him the Book of Daniel after making sacrifice with Alexander in the Second Temple.  Also, Wood's interpretation of Daniel 7:7 and 7:19, 7:23 is slightly off, yet so are many theologians'.  From Daniel 7:19, the beast depicted has feet of brass (Greece, 2:39) teeth of iron (Rome, 2:40).  I believe the proper interpretation is that out of the Greco-Roman world, antichrists would come and persecute the saints Daniel 7:23-26.  (At the time of Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonians' first emperor, the city of Rome was just being founded, 560 B.C. or so., hence even the angel could not put a name to it!)Anyway, there is probably enough written about Alexander the Great to litter the 20,000 miles of territory Wood walked through.  His military feats, are studied today still and his tactics employed by Napoleon and even Hitler (my reason for 4 stars not 5).  I couldn't help thinking of those poor Greek soldiers dying of exhaustion all along the way.

Wood attempts much of the actual path himself, letting us see, and experience virtually, much of what the army experienced. The documentary is worth seeing for this alone, for despite the 2300+ years which have passed since Alexander's time, it is possible to get a sense of the distances, the heights, the valleys, the deserts and the bodies of water which the army traversed in order to ""conquer the world.""The documentary was made several years ago - the date mentioned for the VHS version is 1998 - as Wood makes his journey, one region mentions Saddam Hussain being in power, and the Taliban being in the process of taking Kabul. Given the strife of the region, one has to admire Wood and his crew for their bravery and daring in shooting the documentary (as well as wonder how much paperwork they had to fill out). The conflicts in the area, as well as the well-documented carnage which Alexander and his armies inflicted, make this a far more sobering work than another one of Wood's documentaries, ""In Search of the Trojan War."" Wood, when interviewing locals along the route, finds that Alexander's deeds are often still remembered - and usually hated. Although Wood tries to admire Alexander throughout the documentary, Alexander's war crimes and slaughters and disregard for the lives of even his own people become more and more apparent. Wood tries to excuse this at the end of the four-part piece, explaining that we needed to understand Alexander within the context of his time. For me, this is insufficient.
