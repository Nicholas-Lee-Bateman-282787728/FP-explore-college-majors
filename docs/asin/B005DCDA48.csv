So don't go by the synopsis that was written by someone who obviously didn't watch the film.  Second, the movie is mostly silent, so there's no dialog that helps you follow the story.  However, you soon realize dialog isn't needed because the film never provides a real story line or plot. For example, he flashes back to events from his past but no details or even background are shared. The flashbacks could have been left out of the film and we'd never know the difference.  This story is definitely not about war or politics. What this movie is really about is survival in extreme cold conditions.  Nothing more. So if you're waiting for an explanation of why he killed, what lead him to kill...you'll never get an answer.",2,Synopsis is misleading...way off,1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,842,"['movie', 'well', 'acted', 'Gallo', 'far', 'description', 'First', 'all', 'problem', 'killing', 'anyone', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'synopsis', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'Second', 'movie', 'mostly', 'silent', 'dialog', 'follow', 'story', 'However', 'soon', 'realize', 'dialog', ""n't"", 'needed', 'film', 'never', 'real', 'story', 'line', 'plot', 'example', 'back', 'events', 'past', 'details', 'even', 'background', 'are', 'shared', 'flashbacks', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'film', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'difference', 'story', 'definitely', 'not', 'war', 'politics', 'What', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'survival', 'extreme', 'cold', 'conditions', 'Nothing', 'more', 'So', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'explanation', 'why', 'killed', 'what', 'lead', 'kill', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'answer']",N/A
1455125,A1YF6OX7EBBHQO,B005DCDA48,Ignatius Malibu,"[0, 0]",Interesting that its set in Poland.  Sort of a story for the sake of telling a story about modern war.  US Soldiers are portrayed as brutish Stormtroopers which bothers me because its far from the truth.  I can say that as I've been there.  Politics aside its a kind of interesting &#34;what if&#34; survival story with an unusual setting.  No dialog.  Some questions that are not answered....we assume the woman the main character keeps seeing in his delusionary state is his wife but its never made clear.  We don't know if she is dead or not.  We also don't know why the character who he interacts with later in the movie takes the actions she does.  Much is just left to us to decide.  Kind of like modern art I guess...make your own interpretation.The plain story of a guy in an alien and hostile environment trying to live another day is compelling....just don't put too much thought into it.,3,Not a bad survival story.

1455126,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005DCDA48,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 8]","Despite the prominent blurb from Roger Ebert on the DVD cover which proclaims ""Essential Killing"" is ""pure action,"" really nothing could be further from the truth.  I'm consistently baffled by films that are marketed in a skewed way.  Perhaps in the short run it drives DVD rentals and sales, but it also sets up unrealistic expectations that may upset certain viewers.  While there is undeniable action in ""Essential Killing,"" its sensibilities seem more firmly aligned with the arthouse crowd than those looking for non-stop action mayhem.  That may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your viewing preferences.  Personally, I found this to be a sparse and surprising little film about the struggle for survival and freedom told from the perspective of a lone Taliban fighter adrift in an unknown land.  Vincent Gallo plays the lead in a strong dialogue-free performance that won him Best Actor accolades at the Venice Film Festival.The film begins with Gallo evading unsuspecting American soldiers within the desert caverns of Afghanistan.  When he forces a confrontation, he is caught and detained.  The rest of the film unravels from Gallo's perspective as he is transported to an unknown European location and has no way to communicate with his captors.  He must navigate his harsh winter surroundings in an attempt to survive, but there appears to be nowhere to go.  There are a few firefights and one-on-one confrontations, but he has just as much to fear from the elements as he does from his enemy.  As his journey progresses, Gallo experiences fear, desperation, and confusion and conveys it all succinctly through expression only.  It's a bold and unusual choice.  And despite the character being Taliban, politics and morality play little in the evolving story where one man just does whatever he can to survive.In addition to Gallo's terrific work, the film is beautifully shot with sweeping aerial vistas of both the wintry forest and the desert landscape.  They are broad, expansive, and endless which sets the perfect stage for the drama unfolding.  ""Essential Killing"" is a sparse film, not heavily laden with plot.  But what makes it stand out is that the film really captures the viewpoint of its lost and desperate lead.  The screenplay never gives the viewer more information than Gallo has, so we are very much on the journey with him.  It's a novel approach that works quite well.  If you're looking for a big war or combat effort, this isn't it.  This is a quietly lyrical film that employs elements of an action film.  It requires patience and offers up something completely unique.

Having said that i watch anything that has Vincent Gallos name attached to it.  I will warn you if you are expecting a fast paced, action packed blockbuster, than you will not like this movie.  I cannot say this is a movie I will recommend to others.  I think it may be a matter of taste.  I think it is one of those movies I chose because as i have said, i am very interested in what this particular actor writes, directs or chooses to act in.  I guess i was expecting more because i have loved most of what i have seen from Vincent Gallos body of work.  This movie has almost no dialogue and moves very very slowly.  There is one scene in particular with a young pregnant woman that many may find disturbing to watch.  I do think the movie was trying to say many things about war and the amazing inner workings of most humans to do whatever it takes to survive.  I did think about this movie a number of days after watching it and that is usually a sign for me that i either liked it or learned something from it.  I think the best thing i can say is it is not a movie for those who would enjoy most of the movies showing at big complexes today - It is not for fans of Ironman or Family Guy - if you watch independent film this might be a movie you would like or at least leave you thinking about life in general.",4,S L O W  - need to be in the right frame of mind for this movie,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,1431,"['have', 'been', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'fan', 'movie', 'Buffalo', '66', 'i', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'Love', 'Stories', 'Having', 'said', 'i', 'watch', 'anything', 'Vincent', 'Gallos', 'name', 'attached', 'will', 'warn', 'are', 'expecting', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'packed', 'blockbuster', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'will', 'recommend', 'others', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'matter', 'taste', 'think', 'one', 'movies', 'chose', 'i', 'have', 'said', 'i', 'am', 'very', 'interested', 'what', 'particular', 'actor', 'writes', 'directs', 'chooses', 'act', 'guess', 'i', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'i', 'have', 'loved', 'most', 'what', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'Vincent', 'Gallos', 'body', 'work', 'movie', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'moves', 'very', 'very', 'slowly', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'young', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'many', 'may', 'find', 'disturbing', 'watch', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'many', 'things', 'war', 'amazing', 'inner', 'workings', 'most', 'humans', 'do', 'whatever', 'survive', 'did', 'think', 'movie', 'number', 'days', 'watching', 'usually', 'sign', 'i', 'liked', 'learned', 'something', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'not', 'movie', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'most', 'movies', 'showing', 'big', 'complexes', 'today', 'not', 'fans', 'Ironman', 'Family', 'Guy', 'watch', 'independent', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'least', 'leave', 'thinking', 'life', 'general']",N/A

1455130,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005DCDA48,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","In Jerzy Skolimowski's ""Essential Killing,"" Vincent Gallo (""Buffalo `66"") is Mohammed, a man on the run from the American military in the middle of the desert and the snowy wilderness. Though Emmanuelle Seigner (""Frantic"") briefly appears, the film is about the survival of this art house-type Rambo played by thickly bearded Gallo. Not much is revealed about the man's past, which is suggested in several short flashback scenes and voiceovers.Skolimowski makes his point in portraying the film's central figure as someone quite unheroic. Survival is his only goal and for that purpose he does anything including killing. Gallo's character (who doesn't speak a word throughout) acts and looks like a wild animal. We may be invited to share his grueling experience, if not asked to identify with him.Skolimowski's concept of minimalist filmmaking (or making what is everything a typical Hollywood action film is not) is initially intriguing, but after thirty minutes or so the film begins to lose momentum, getting repetitious and running out of ideas. The film's ""breastfeeding"" scene looks just out of place. Also, to me the idea of Vincent Gallo as a Muslim soldier is not very convincing.With all respect to filmmakers, I think ""Essential Killing"" is one of the examples of filmmaking style, that sound great in theory but turn out differently in practice.",3,Minimalist Rambo,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,1359,"['Jerzy', 'Skolimowski', 'Essential', 'Killing', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'Buffalo', '66', 'Mohammed', 'man', 'run', 'American', 'military', 'middle', 'desert', 'snowy', 'wilderness', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'Frantic', 'briefly', 'film', 'survival', 'art', 'house-type', 'Rambo', 'played', 'thickly', 'bearded', 'Gallo', 'Not', 'much', 'revealed', 'man', 'past', 'suggested', 'several', 'short', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'voiceovers.Skolimowski', 'point', 'portraying', 'film', 'central', 'figure', 'someone', 'quite', 'unheroic', 'Survival', 'only', 'goal', 'purpose', 'anything', 'including', 'killing', 'Gallo', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'word', 'acts', 'wild', 'animal', 'may', 'be', 'invited', 'share', 'grueling', 'experience', 'not', 'asked', 'identify', 'him.Skolimowski', 'concept', 'minimalist', 'filmmaking', 'making', 'what', 'everything', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'initially', 'intriguing', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'lose', 'momentum', 'getting', 'repetitious', 'running', 'out', 'ideas', 'film', 'breastfeeding', 'scene', 'just', 'place', 'Also', 'idea', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'Muslim', 'soldier', 'not', 'very', 'convincing.With', 'respect', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'Essential', 'Killing', 'one', 'examples', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'sound', 'great', 'theory', 'turn', 'out', 'differently', 'practice']",N/A
