576713,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005AAAI,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Recently, in a DVD review of the film documentary about 1960's folk legend Bob Dylan's mid-career crisis, ""Bob Dylan: After the Crash: 1966-78"", I noted, in passing, that folk guitarist Tom Paley (who was prominently featured in that film) and his group, The New Lost City Ramblers, were already waiting at the gates of Greenwich Village when the hordes of young folk revivalists started to arrive. The folk artist under review, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, in this very personal film documentary directed by his daughter, Ailaya Elliott, was also waiting there for them. Or, as the film makes clear, he was at least rumored to be waiting for them. This almost two hour bittersweet valentine to the now grand old man of the folk music revival (in 2000) is the story of why he was waiting for them, and more importantly, why they were searching for him as an agent of ""authentic"" American roots music.As has also been mentioned, seemingly endlessly, in this space in many reviews over the past year or so about the male division of the folk revival of the 1960's I have tried to explore, why or why not, certain talented folk singers never reached the status of Bob Dylan, the acknowledged ""king of the hill"" of that revival. From the first paragraph we already know that Ramblin' Jack was already on the scene. Moreover, he had the pedigree that all aspiring folkies craved, including Dylan- physical links to the legendary Woody Guthrie the herald of the previous generation of the folk troubadours from the dust bowl 1930's. Moreover Jack was a quick study, really wanted to expand the folk universe and, as this film also makes abundantly clear, he just plain liked the life style of the itinerant wanderer. So what gives?Well, Jack just liked to keep wandering, and wandering in motion and speech and not getting attached, at least for long, to any one place person or thing. That, my friends, is the codified social genetic structure that some people live with as they try to reinvent themselves. In Jack's case from a nice Jewish city boy (the Brooklyn of the title of this review) to an old cowboy. This is hardly the first time that someone has turned their persona around in the whirlwind of the homeland of personal reinvention, America. However, it took something out of him, as he himself reflects on his life as he travels the roads back to the past (in an RV) with his ambivalent director daughter in tow.But here is my take on why he was left seemingly behind in the mad whirl of the folk revival and its aftermath. He didn't move, like Dylan, either with the times or with his own drummer. He started out as a Woody acolyte, as did Dylan, but he wanted to preserve the purity of the Woody canon, intact. As a transmission belt from Woody to Dylan Ramblin' Jack performed a yeoman's service. But where is Jack's equivalent of not just ""Song to Woody"" but ""Desolation Row"", ""Tangled Up In Blue"", ""Visions of Johanna"", and so on. That said, this film is filled with various close-ups of Ramblin' Jack doing his unique covers of many songs, the usual rare film footage of the early days of the folk revival, of Jack Elliott and his family life and the usual ""talking head"" commentary from friends, lovers and folk colleagues that round out these kinds of efforts. This is a daughter's film, this is a folkie's film and this is a welcome addition to the growing body of visual tributes to American roots music and its practitioners. Kudos, Ailaya.",4,"Once Again, From The Prairies Of Brooklyn",1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,3452,"['Recently', 'DVD', 'review', 'film', 'documentary', '1960', 'folk', 'legend', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'mid-career', 'crisis', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Crash', '1966-78', 'noted', 'passing', 'folk', 'guitarist', 'Tom', 'Paley', 'who', 'was', 'prominently', 'featured', 'film', 'group', 'New', 'Lost', 'City', 'Ramblers', 'were', 'already', 'waiting', 'gates', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'when', 'hordes', 'young', 'folk', 'revivalists', 'started', 'arrive', 'folk', 'artist', 'review', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'Elliott', 'very', 'personal', 'film', 'documentary', 'directed', 'daughter', 'Ailaya', 'Elliott', 'was', 'also', 'waiting', 'there', 'film', 'clear', 'was', 'least', 'rumored', 'be', 'waiting', 'almost', 'two', 'hour', 'bittersweet', 'valentine', 'now', 'grand', 'old', 'man', 'folk', 'music', 'revival', '2000', 'story', 'why', 'was', 'waiting', 'more', 'importantly', 'why', 'were', 'searching', 'agent', 'authentic', 'American', 'roots', 'music.As', 'also', 'been', 'mentioned', 'seemingly', 'endlessly', 'space', 'many', 'reviews', 'past', 'year', 'so', 'male', 'division', 'folk', 'revival', '1960', 'have', 'tried', 'explore', 'why', 'why', 'not', 'certain', 'talented', 'folk', 'singers', 'never', 'reached', 'status', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'acknowledged', 'king', 'hill', 'revival', 'first', 'paragraph', 'already', 'know', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'was', 'already', 'scene', 'Moreover', 'had', 'pedigree', 'aspiring', 'folkies', 'craved', 'including', 'Dylan-', 'physical', 'links', 'legendary', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'herald', 'previous', 'generation', 'folk', 'troubadours', 'dust', 'bowl', '1930', 'Moreover', 'Jack', 'was', 'quick', 'study', 'really', 'wanted', 'expand', 'folk', 'universe', 'film', 'also', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'just', 'plain', 'liked', 'life', 'style', 'itinerant', 'wanderer', 'what', 'Well', 'Jack', 'just', 'liked', 'keep', 'wandering', 'wandering', 'motion', 'speech', 'not', 'getting', 'attached', 'least', 'long', 'one', 'place', 'person', 'thing', 'friends', 'codified', 'social', 'genetic', 'structure', 'people', 'live', 'try', 'reinvent', 'Jack', 'case', 'nice', 'Jewish', 'city', 'boy', 'Brooklyn', 'title', 'review', 'old', 'cowboy', 'hardly', 'first', 'time', 'someone', 'turned', 'persona', 'whirlwind', 'homeland', 'personal', 'reinvention', 'America', 'However', 'took', 'something', 'life', 'roads', 'back', 'past', 'RV', 'ambivalent', 'director', 'daughter', 'tow.But', 'here', 'take', 'why', 'was', 'left', 'seemingly', 'mad', 'whirl', 'folk', 'revival', 'aftermath', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'Dylan', 'either', 'times', 'own', 'drummer', 'started', 'out', 'Woody', 'acolyte', 'did', 'Dylan', 'wanted', 'preserve', 'purity', 'Woody', 'canon', 'intact', 'transmission', 'belt', 'Woody', 'Dylan', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'performed', 'yeoman', 'service', 'where', 'Jack', 'equivalent', 'not', 'just', 'Song', 'Woody', 'Desolation', 'Row', 'Tangled', 'Up', 'Blue', 'Visions', 'Johanna', 'so', 'said', 'film', 'filled', 'various', 'close-ups', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'doing', 'unique', 'covers', 'many', 'songs', 'usual', 'rare', 'film', 'footage', 'early', 'days', 'folk', 'revival', 'Jack', 'Elliott', 'family', 'life', 'usual', 'talking', 'head', 'commentary', 'friends', 'lovers', 'folk', 'colleagues', 'round', 'kinds', 'efforts', 'daughter', 'film', 'folkie', 'film', 'welcome', 'addition', 'growing', 'body', 'visual', 'tributes', 'American', 'roots', 'music', 'practitioners', 'Kudos', 'Ailaya']",N/A

Well, maybe it is.People who want to see a portrait of a true 1960's person with the wonderful mentality of those long departed times should see this documentary movie.Ramblin Jack Elliott was (and is...still living at age 81 in 2012 as this is written) a true 1960's person, and was before the 1960's even started. He started his 1960's life in the 1940's when he ran away from home to become a cowboy, and later became the prot&eacute;g&eacute; and house mate of Woody Guthrie in Queens (NYC), New York before Woody lost his health.See the Wikipedia biog article about Ramblin Jack Elliott to learn about what is shown in this wonderful documentary, made by his daughter, Aiyanna Elliott.She's a predictably bitchy radical feminist, and so was her mother....no wonder Ramblin Jack spent little time with either of them over the years, and no wonder he apologizes very little for his avoidance, non-presence in their lives. Dreadful women, and the documentary shows that, though that is not supposed to be the point of what is revealed.Jack Elliott is a wonderful person and a gifted artist. This movie shows that.He was part of the 1960's and never left it, never gave up.....is still out there ""doin"" it.I've never seen such a terrific portrait of a 1960's person as in this documentary. Another worth seeing, which shows the same thing (a 60's guy who never left the 1960's, even in his old age) is the documentary titled ""George Harrison: Living In The Material World"" (2011).Neither Elliott nor Harrison were political....both were musicians, primarily, and the music in both docs is wonderful to hear and remember, especially for those who were there for the 1960's and remember it well, and miss it.---------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG actor.",5,"""Ballad Of Ramblin' Jack Elliott"" (2000) documentary: Wonderful portrait of a '60's era rebel and artist of high gifts",1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,2105,"['Ballad', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'Elliott', '2000', 'documentary', 'Wonderful', 'portrait', ""'60"", 'era', 'rebel', 'artist', 'high', 'gifts', 'who', 'never', 'quit', '60', '81', 'years', 'old', '2012.The', 'cult', 'movie', 'titled', 'Dinner', 'Andre', '1981', 'question', 'What', '1960', 'were', 'high', 'point', 'civilization', 'downhill', 'now', 'Well', 'maybe', 'is.People', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'portrait', 'true', '1960', 'person', 'wonderful', 'mentality', 'long', 'departed', 'times', 'should', 'see', 'documentary', 'movie.Ramblin', 'Jack', 'Elliott', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'age', '81', '2012', 'written', 'true', '1960', 'person', 'was', '1960', 'even', 'started', 'started', '1960', 'life', '1940', 'when', 'ran', 'away', 'home', 'become', 'cowboy', 'later', 'became', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'house', 'mate', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Queens', 'NYC', 'New', 'York', 'Woody', 'lost', 'health.See', 'Wikipedia', 'biog', 'article', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'Elliott', 'learn', 'what', 'shown', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'made', 'daughter', 'Aiyanna', 'Elliott.She', 'predictably', 'bitchy', 'radical', 'feminist', 'so', 'was', 'mother', '.no', 'wonder', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'spent', 'little', 'time', 'years', 'wonder', 'very', 'little', 'avoidance', 'non-presence', 'lives', 'Dreadful', 'women', 'documentary', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'point', 'what', 'revealed.Jack', 'Elliott', 'wonderful', 'person', 'gifted', 'artist', 'movie', 'that.He', 'was', 'part', '1960', 'never', 'left', 'never', 'gave', 'up', '..is', 'still', 'there', 'doin', 'it.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'terrific', 'portrait', '1960', 'person', 'documentary', 'worth', 'seeing', 'same', 'thing', '60', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'left', '1960', 'even', 'old', 'age', 'documentary', 'titled', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Living', 'Material', 'World', '2011', 'Elliott', 'Harrison', 'were', 'political', 'were', 'musicians', 'primarily', 'music', 'docs', 'wonderful', 'hear', 'remember', 'especially', 'who', 'were', 'there', '1960', 'remember', 'well', 'miss', 'it.', '-Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG', 'actor']",N/A
576715,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B00005AAAI,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[7, 8]","What a treat! True, the film could have been developed more more professionally. True, there were too many shots of whiny ex-wives. And a psychoanalyst might have a field day with this film: Jack's aunt describes Jack's mom in uncomplimentary terms, to say the least. And maybe that's why Jack had so many different wives and girlfriends.But what's important is that Aiyana Elliott did make a film, however flawed.  Jack's not the type to dictate his memoirs. Without this video, we'd never have the opportunity to appreciate one man's fascinating life.Born in Brooklyn to a doctor and a teacher, Jack always knew he wanted to be a cowboy.  I was surprised to see so many home movies still preserved -- but there was Jack, galloping around on an imaginary horse.  At age fifteen Jack ran away to join the rodeo. He returned to finish high school, most reluctantly, and then assumed his new identity of cowboy and folk singer.Very few people make such a break from their childhoods and create their own identity from scratch.  Even fewer live as free spirits.  Jack was made for, and shaped by, an era when young boys could run off and join the rodeo without getting anybody arrested. He could watch cowboy movies and meet real cowboys in Madison Square Garden.Jack deserves a video just for the way he lived his life. The music is frosting on the cake, and very thick frosting it is, too.Aiyana initially wants to know her dad and have at least one conversation with him. One of the strongest moments comes when Arlo Guthrie urges her to give up her quest. Maybe it's not for you to know, he says. There's a bit of irony here: Woodly Guthrie was Jack Elliott's mentor and now his son Arlo mentors Jack's daughter, if only briefly.Jack Elliott wanted to do things his way, even if his way may seem difficult, even self-destructive, to an outsider.  He was too ""disorganized"" to attract a top-quality manager. Norman Leventhal, who managed many folk singers (including the Weavers) explained: You'd spend a long time setting up a deal, and then Jack couldn't be found.Because Jack doesn't talk -- apparently to anyone, not just his daughter -- we'll never know how he felt as he ventured around the country during those years. Did he ever get frustrated or sad or discouraged?  Maybe he buried his feelings so he could keep going. Maybe he never had many bad days: he's certainly one of the most cheerful, gregarious  characters ever captured on film.  Too much introspection would have driven him off the road.As one interviewee says, maybe Jack could have settled down into a house with a ""normal"" family. Maybe he would have been happy. But he wouldn't have been Jack.  I don't think he would have been happy, either.  Being somewhat of a wanderer myself, I believe some people are made to keep moving, and they're miserable if they force themselves to settle too quickly.I'm not musically expert enough to evaluate Jack's talent. His sound isn't as strong or individual as, say, Johnny Cash or Kris Kristofferson, both of whom appear in the film. But he's got intensity and feeling.  And he never stopped traveling, singing and learning.The video ends with Ramblin Jack accepting a national arts award from President Clinton, just after he had won a grammy for his first studio album.  A fictional movie with a lead character like Jack and an ending like this one would be dismissed as a sappy fairy tale with a Hollywood ending. The charm of this video is that, on the contrary, it's very very real.",5,Ramblin' Video,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,3502,"['What', 'treat', 'True', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'more', 'professionally', 'True', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'shots', 'whiny', 'ex-wives', 'psychoanalyst', 'might', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'film', 'Jack', 'aunt', 'Jack', 'mom', 'uncomplimentary', 'terms', 'say', 'least', 'maybe', 'why', 'Jack', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'wives', 'girlfriends.But', 'what', 'important', 'Aiyana', 'Elliott', 'did', 'make', 'film', 'however', 'flawed', 'Jack', 'not', 'type', 'dictate', 'memoirs', 'video', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'opportunity', 'appreciate', 'one', 'man', 'fascinating', 'life.Born', 'Brooklyn', 'doctor', 'teacher', 'Jack', 'always', 'knew', 'wanted', 'be', 'cowboy', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'home', 'movies', 'still', 'preserved', 'was', 'Jack', 'galloping', 'around', 'imaginary', 'horse', 'age', 'fifteen', 'Jack', 'ran', 'away', 'join', 'rodeo', 'returned', 'finish', 'high', 'school', 'most', 'reluctantly', 'then', 'assumed', 'new', 'identity', 'cowboy', 'folk', 'singer.Very', 'few', 'people', 'make', 'such', 'break', 'childhoods', 'create', 'own', 'identity', 'scratch', 'Even', 'fewer', 'live', 'free', 'spirits', 'Jack', 'was', 'made', 'shaped', 'era', 'when', 'young', 'boys', 'could', 'run', 'off', 'join', 'rodeo', 'getting', 'anybody', 'arrested', 'could', 'watch', 'cowboy', 'movies', 'meet', 'real', 'cowboys', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden.Jack', 'video', 'just', 'way', 'lived', 'life', 'music', 'frosting', 'cake', 'very', 'thick', 'frosting', 'initially', 'know', 'dad', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'conversation', 'One', 'strongest', 'moments', 'when', 'Arlo', 'Guthrie', 'give', 'up', 'quest', 'not', 'know', 'bit', 'irony', 'here', 'Woodly', 'Guthrie', 'was', 'Jack', 'Elliott', 'mentor', 'now', 'son', 'Arlo', 'mentors', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'only', 'briefly.Jack', 'Elliott', 'wanted', 'do', 'things', 'way', 'even', 'way', 'may', 'seem', 'difficult', 'even', 'self-destructive', 'outsider', 'was', 'too', 'disorganized', 'attract', 'top-quality', 'manager', 'Norman', 'Leventhal', 'who', 'managed', 'many', 'folk', 'singers', 'including', 'Weavers', 'explained', ""'d"", 'spend', 'long', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'deal', 'then', 'Jack', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'found.Because', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'talk', 'apparently', 'anyone', 'not', 'just', 'daughter', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'how', 'felt', 'ventured', 'country', 'years', 'Did', 'ever', 'get', 'frustrated', 'sad', 'discouraged', 'Maybe', 'buried', 'feelings', 'could', 'keep', 'going', 'Maybe', 'never', 'had', 'many', 'bad', 'days', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'cheerful', 'gregarious', 'characters', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'Too', 'much', 'introspection', 'would', 'have', 'driven', 'off', 'road.As', 'one', 'interviewee', 'maybe', 'Jack', 'could', 'have', 'settled', 'down', 'house', 'normal', 'family', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'Jack', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'either', 'Being', 'somewhat', 'wanderer', 'believe', 'people', 'are', 'made', 'keep', 'moving', ""'re"", 'miserable', 'force', 'settle', 'too', 'quickly.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'musically', 'expert', 'enough', 'evaluate', 'Jack', 'talent', 'sound', ""n't"", 'strong', 'individual', 'say', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'whom', 'appear', 'film', 'got', 'intensity', 'feeling', 'never', 'stopped', 'traveling', 'singing', 'learning.The', 'video', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'accepting', 'national', 'arts', 'award', 'President', 'Clinton', 'just', 'had', 'won', 'grammy', 'first', 'studio', 'album', 'fictional', 'movie', 'lead', 'character', 'Jack', 'ending', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'dismissed', 'sappy', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'charm', 'video', 'contrary', 'very', 'very', 'real']",N/A

The film certainly gave me an appreciation for his haunting vocal style and prodigious flat picking.  But Ramblin' Jack himself, as much as his music, is the real heart of the story -- his personality and talent, in a unique time and place (living with Woodie Guthrie and becoming his protege just as Woodie's health was failing); creating his persona straight from youthful imagination (much like Bob Dylan, who owes much to him musically); his peripatetic wanderings and penchant for absorbing the texture of life across America; his conversational style, which was as rambling as it was entertaining; even the way he shopped for groceries (related in a hilarious anecdote by a friend) -- all made him impossibly charismatic, completely unique, and a real treasure.  Sadly, these same traits also made him a forgetful and mostly absentee father, and in this film made by his daughter he poignantly acknowledges the pain he caused her.

Adams,"[0, 0]","I've been a casual Jack Elliott fan for about 45 years now, since shortly after I discovered Woody Guthrie and Cisco Houston and their generation of singers and pickers and songwriters. Jack represents the succeeding generation, one step ahead of Dylan and Baez and Ochs and Paxton, et. al. Jack was taught by Woody and lived with his family and traveled with Guthrie during the final year or two that Woody was healthy enough to travel. This is a personal film by Jack's only child, a daughter who was in effect, abandoned by her father so he could pursue his demons, including a folksinging career that hardly ever made him any money. We see some great archival footage here of Woody performing with Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, of Jack on the Johnny Cash and Pete Seeger TV shows, of the early Dylan, of Odetta, and several others. There is a lot of video of Jack, late in life, still out there on small stages for small wages. Elliott avoided making records for about 20 years, but in the 1990's he put out three CD's of songs and stories which, while not masterpieces, are worth owning if you love his era and his style. I enjoyed the film much more than I thought I would. It is true that Jack is revealed as a near-totally absent father, who still cannot connect on a conversationally intimate level with his now adult child. He is a bit self-absorbed, a compulsive talker off the stage whose subjects get old, even to his best friends. He had some drug and drink woes in mid-career as well. However, he is a survivor, a link to the post-WW II folksinging revivalists who never enjoyed the money and acclaim that the Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul and Mary, Dylan and others received. Without Woody, and Pete, and The Weavers, and Cisco, and Jack, however, the ones who followed and who made it big would not have had the songs, and styles, to copy and to make more commercial. ""The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack"" is a bittersweet experience by the end, for Jack goes on being ""Ramblin' Jack"" and his daughter, who made the movie, goes on being frustrated at not getting to know what made her father do what he did.",5,"For us old folkies, this footage is impressive...",1142640000,"03 18, 2006",2006,2115,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'casual', 'Jack', 'Elliott', 'fan', '45', 'years', 'now', 'shortly', 'discovered', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Cisco', 'Houston', 'generation', 'singers', 'pickers', 'songwriters', 'Jack', 'succeeding', 'generation', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Dylan', 'Baez', 'Ochs', 'Paxton', 'et', 'al', 'Jack', 'was', 'taught', 'Woody', 'lived', 'family', 'traveled', 'Guthrie', 'final', 'year', 'two', 'Woody', 'was', 'healthy', 'enough', 'travel', 'personal', 'film', 'Jack', 'only', 'child', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'effect', 'abandoned', 'father', 'could', 'pursue', 'demons', 'including', 'folksinging', 'career', 'hardly', 'ever', 'made', 'money', 'see', 'great', 'archival', 'footage', 'here', 'Woody', 'performing', 'Sonny', 'Terry', 'Brownie', 'McGhee', 'Jack', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'TV', 'shows', 'early', 'Dylan', 'Odetta', 'several', 'others', 'lot', 'video', 'Jack', 'late', 'life', 'still', 'there', 'small', 'stages', 'small', 'wages', 'Elliott', 'avoided', 'making', 'records', '20', 'years', '1990', 'put', 'out', 'three', 'CD', 'songs', 'stories', 'not', 'masterpieces', 'are', 'worth', 'owning', 'love', 'era', 'style', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'true', 'Jack', 'revealed', 'near-totally', 'absent', 'father', 'who', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'connect', 'conversationally', 'intimate', 'level', 'now', 'child', 'bit', 'self-absorbed', 'compulsive', 'talker', 'stage', 'subjects', 'get', 'old', 'even', 'best', 'friends', 'had', 'drug', 'drink', 'woes', 'mid-career', 'well', 'However', 'survivor', 'link', 'post-WW', 'II', 'folksinging', 'revivalists', 'who', 'never', 'enjoyed', 'money', 'acclaim', 'Kingston', 'Trio', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'Dylan', 'others', 'received', 'Woody', 'Pete', 'Weavers', 'Cisco', 'Jack', 'however', 'ones', 'who', 'followed', 'who', 'made', 'big', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'songs', 'styles', 'copy', 'make', 'more', 'commercial', 'Ballad', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'bittersweet', 'experience', 'end', 'Jack', 'being', 'Ramblin', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'being', 'frustrated', 'not', 'getting', 'know', 'what', 'made', 'father', 'do', 'what', 'did']",N/A
