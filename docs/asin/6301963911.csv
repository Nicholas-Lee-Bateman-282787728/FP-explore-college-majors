275383,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6301963911,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 1]","Before 'Borat'Borat - Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (Widescreen Edition)confronted anti-Semitism, and SeinfeldSeinfeld - Season 7did brilliant comedy about ""nothing,"" 'Annie Hall' said a great deal about a lot of things of varying magnitude in this funny Woody Allen movie masterpiece.  Taking place, of course, in New York City, Allen's nearly autobiographical alter ego, Alvy Singer, has an on-again, off-again romance with the titled character (Diane Keaton) who is his soul mate and counterpart to his own labored existence.  Episodic for sure, Allen's directing and co-writing take everything bothersome and makes it into an honest labor of love.  (Alvy, too, is a stand-up comic who spars about anything from strained love relationships to Republican politics.  Not to mention both have that eloquent obssession with ""sex and death"".)  While Alvy always seems maladjusted, he is unable to cope without Annie who, while from Chippewa Falls, WI, can relate to him and help him through the shipwreck of his nuerotic life.'Annie Hall' is exceptionally funny.  In one scene Annie is relating a dream to Alvy where ""Frank Sinatra is suffocating"" her.  Alvy, quick to psychoanalysis, immediately says that she is suffocating her career as a singer.  She counters that her therapist says that it is he who is suffocating her because his last name in Singer.  (And by all means psychology gets a comedic thrashing many times.)  While thinking aloud on the street, Alvy stops a couple to ask them roughly why they seemed so happy.  ""Basically, I'm shallow,"" she confides.  ""I'm basically shallow, too,"" he adds.  In another scene he talks to his friend (Tony Roberts), where he relates talking to a dinner guest.  He talks about the meal and tells of a companion who said, ""I had salad.  Didjyou?""  To which they both debate anti-semitism.  Similarly, he's great at showing what it's like to be scrutinized as a dinner guest.  There's also a split-screen scene where Alvie and Annie are each talking to their pyschiatrists and the differences are acutely funny.  (One should also add that Allen did more in these few minutes than 'Conversations with Other Women' did in a whole movie.)  Pet peeves are also confronted to provide creator and audience with plenty of therapeutic laughs.'Annie Hall' is just delightful fun.  Chockful of wit and candor, it is a sustaining comedic classic. (Also with cameo appearances by Shelley Duvall as a 'Rolling Stone' reporter and Paul Simon.)",5,"Separating the ""Horrible and the Miserable""",1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,2522,"[""'Borat'Borat"", 'Cultural', 'Learnings', 'America', 'Make', 'Benefit', 'Glorious', 'Nation', 'Kazakhstan', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'confronted', 'anti-Semitism', 'SeinfeldSeinfeld', 'Season', '7did', 'brilliant', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'Hall', 'said', 'great', 'deal', 'lot', 'things', 'varying', 'magnitude', 'funny', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'Taking', 'place', 'course', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Allen', 'nearly', 'autobiographical', 'alter', 'ego', 'Alvy', 'Singer', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'romance', 'titled', 'character', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'soul', 'mate', 'counterpart', 'own', 'labored', 'existence', 'Episodic', 'sure', 'Allen', 'directing', 'co-writing', 'take', 'everything', 'bothersome', 'honest', 'labor', 'love', 'Alvy', 'too', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'who', 'anything', 'strained', 'love', 'relationships', 'Republican', 'politics', 'Not', 'mention', 'have', 'eloquent', 'obssession', 'sex', 'death', 'Alvy', 'always', 'maladjusted', 'unable', 'cope', 'Annie', 'who', 'Chippewa', 'Falls', 'WI', 'can', 'relate', 'help', 'shipwreck', 'nuerotic', 'life', 'Hall', 'exceptionally', 'funny', 'one', 'scene', 'Annie', 'relating', 'dream', 'Alvy', 'where', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'suffocating', 'Alvy', 'quick', 'psychoanalysis', 'immediately', 'suffocating', 'career', 'singer', 'therapist', 'who', 'suffocating', 'last', 'name', 'Singer', 'means', 'psychology', 'comedic', 'thrashing', 'many', 'times', 'thinking', 'aloud', 'street', 'Alvy', 'couple', 'ask', 'roughly', 'why', 'seemed', 'so', 'happy', 'Basically', ""'m"", 'shallow', ""'m"", 'basically', 'shallow', 'too', 'scene', 'friend', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'where', 'talking', 'dinner', 'guest', 'meal', 'tells', 'companion', 'who', 'said', 'had', 'salad', 'Didjyou', 'debate', 'anti-semitism', 'Similarly', 'great', 'showing', 'what', 'be', 'scrutinized', 'dinner', 'guest', 'also', 'split-screen', 'scene', 'where', 'Alvie', 'Annie', 'are', 'talking', 'pyschiatrists', 'differences', 'are', 'acutely', 'funny', 'One', 'should', 'also', 'add', 'Allen', 'did', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', ""'Conversations"", 'Other', 'Women', 'did', 'whole', 'movie', 'Pet', 'peeves', 'are', 'also', 'confronted', 'provide', 'creator', 'audience', 'plenty', 'therapeutic', 'laughs', 'Hall', 'just', 'delightful', 'fun', 'Chockful', 'wit', 'candor', 'sustaining', 'comedic', 'classic', 'Also', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Shelley', 'Duvall', ""'Rolling"", 'Stone', 'reporter', 'Paul', 'Simon']",N/A

275386,AGEIT17HENDIS,6301963911,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","Hey, haven't I already reviewed this movie. No, sorry that was Manhattan another in the line of very witty Woody Allen movies. But the point is this it is the same subject that Woody addressed there even though chronologically Annie Hall came first by a couple of years and received the lion's share of kudos and awards. As virtually always Allen is intent upon commenting on New York life and its intellectual trends and the ups and downs of relationships, mainly with women. Here he adds a flourish by contrasting old New York (in the 1970's) to up and coming California as the cultural mecca of the American empire. And, as should be the case, New York wins.Add to that the perennial issue of Woody's struggle with `interpersonal' relationships and his angst-driven desire to understand the modern world and you have a very fine social commentary of the times. Needless to say Woody's love interest Annie Hall (as played by his then paramour Diane Keaton) keeps him hopping. As does an ensemble cast that works well together as foils for his ironic and savage humor. The only surprise in revisiting this film recently is how well Keaton played her role as an up and coming torch singer. Of course, I have always been a sucker for torch singers but that is another matter. Some of the humor may seem dated and very 1970's New Yorkish. Some of Woody's mannerisms and use of sight gags may seem like old news.

I'm talking about, of course, Annie Hall and The Graduate.  They were very similar, in as much as both were about two completely self-centered, dull people and whether or not they would get together.  But where The Graduate had Anne Bancroft to add some value to the film, Annie Hall has only a few sparse slightly clever scenes.  The flashback scene to Woody's childhood, with an adult Woody and Diane watching comes to mind.  But, by the time I got through this 2+ hour snoozer, anything mildly amusing was a far distant memory.  In my opinion, Woody's humor only works well in light comedies.  Play It Again Sam, Manhattan Murder Mystery, and, most recently, Small Time Crooks were A+ entertainment.  Anytime Woody does drama, he just seems extremely annoying.  Maybe I just haven't seen the correct Allen drama yet.

275390,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301963911,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Hailed as Woody Allen's finest film, `Annie Hall' has some pretty weighty expectations to live up to, and what amazes me is that each and every time I watch it I am reminded of why Allen is loved to much among the cinemaphiles like myself.  Now I admit to not having seen much Allen, and I admit that the first time I saw `Annie Hall' I shut it off about ten minutes in because I couldn't get into it.  I was put off by Allen's style of storytelling.  Then I saw some of Allen's more recent work, like `Match Point' and the ever brilliant `Hannah and Her Sisters' (I know, not really recent) and I was prompted to give `Annie Hall' another try.  I found that the opening didn't put me off as much as I remembered and soon I was completely engrossed in the film.I seriously couldn't take my eyes off the screen.I can't for the life of me decide which film I truly prefer (`Annie Hall' or `Hannah and Her Sisters') but fact remains that both films are cinematic gems.  Once one grows accustomed to Allen's flare for storytelling you become a part of his story, as if you were hearing each word from a dear friend.  Sure, the delivery is sporadic and spontaneous and at times it throws you off, but that's the kind of friend Woody Allen is; he's kind of crazy, but in a good way.The film tells the story of comedian Alvy Singer who falls in love with Annie Hall, a ditzy yet tantalizing young woman.  The film really just tells us of their relationship; the good and bad times, the fights and intimacies and really fleshes out these two people right before our eyes.What I think is so poignant about `Annie Hall' is that it depicts a relationship that is as average as they come and so any and everyone can relate and draw from this film.  The audience can immediately place themselves in the film and understand both Singer and Hall and this helps the audience make a personal and emotional connection to the material; thus causing us to care deeply about the outcome.  The film beautifully captures the strains that insecurities and difference can cause on a relationship and approaches the subjects of independence and desire with precision and grace.The film is only elevated by the brilliant performances by the two leads.  Keaton, who rightfully won the Oscar for her performance, is exciting and mysterious, intriguing and complex.  Her character is desirous from the very beginning and she builds on her intricacies magnificently.  Allen is a revelation, and in all honesty my favorite part of the film.  His neurotic shtick can get a little tiresome (as was seen in `Scoop') but here he is genuine and passionate with his delivery, to the point where he is not only tolerable but wholly enjoyable.`Annie Hall' has already received classic status and will always be regarded as one of the finest films of all time.  I'm here to simply agree and urge anyone who has yet to see the film to check it out ASAP.  Coming from a man who was once put off by the auteur that is Woody Allen, this is truly an astounding film.  Set aside any preconceived notions of what you're going to see and just dive right it, for this film has everything a movie lover needs to survive.",5,"Beautifully constructed story of a genuine, pure and real relationship...",1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,3169,"['Hailed', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'finest', 'film', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'pretty', 'weighty', 'expectations', 'live', 'up', 'what', 'time', 'watch', 'am', 'reminded', 'why', 'Allen', 'loved', 'much', 'cinemaphiles', 'Now', 'admit', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'much', 'Allen', 'admit', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'shut', 'off', 'ten', 'minutes', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'Allen', 'style', 'storytelling', 'Then', 'saw', 'Allen', 'more', 'recent', 'work', 'Match', 'Point', 'ever', 'brilliant', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'know', 'not', 'really', 'recent', 'was', 'prompted', 'give', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'try', 'found', 'opening', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'off', 'as', 'much', 'remembered', 'soon', 'was', 'completely', 'engrossed', 'film.I', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'screen.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'decide', 'film', 'truly', 'prefer', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'fact', 'films', 'are', 'cinematic', 'gems', 'Once', 'one', 'accustomed', 'Allen', 'flare', 'storytelling', 'become', 'part', 'story', 'were', 'hearing', 'word', 'dear', 'friend', 'Sure', 'delivery', 'sporadic', 'spontaneous', 'times', 'off', 'kind', 'friend', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'kind', 'crazy', 'good', 'way.The', 'film', 'story', 'comedian', 'Alvy', 'Singer', 'who', 'love', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'ditzy', 'yet', 'tantalizing', 'young', 'woman', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'relationship', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'fights', 'intimacies', 'really', 'out', 'two', 'people', 'right', 'eyes.What', 'think', 'so', 'poignant', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'relationship', 'as', 'average', 'come', 'so', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'draw', 'film', 'audience', 'can', 'immediately', 'place', 'film', 'understand', 'Singer', 'Hall', 'audience', 'make', 'personal', 'emotional', 'connection', 'material', 'thus', 'causing', 'care', 'deeply', 'outcome', 'film', 'beautifully', 'strains', 'insecurities', 'difference', 'can', 'cause', 'relationship', 'subjects', 'independence', 'desire', 'precision', 'grace.The', 'film', 'only', 'elevated', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'Keaton', 'who', 'rightfully', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'exciting', 'mysterious', 'intriguing', 'complex', 'character', 'desirous', 'very', 'beginning', 'intricacies', 'magnificently', 'Allen', 'revelation', 'honesty', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'neurotic', 'shtick', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'tiresome', 'was', 'seen', 'Scoop', 'here', 'genuine', 'passionate', 'delivery', 'point', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'tolerable', 'wholly', 'enjoyable.', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'already', 'received', 'classic', 'status', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'time', ""'m"", 'here', 'simply', 'agree', 'urge', 'anyone', 'who', 'yet', 'see', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'ASAP', 'Coming', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'put', 'off', 'auteur', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'truly', 'astounding', 'film', 'Set', 'aside', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'just', 'dive', 'right', 'film', 'everything', 'movie', 'lover', 'survive']",N/A

275401,A20IIR0422G3A5,6301963911,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[41, 45]","`Annie Hall', directed by Woody Allen and written by Allen and Marshall Brickman is eminently rewatchable, which is the one quality that makes it an excellent DVD purchase. I have seen this movie at least a half dozen times, and I am still discovering interesting things in the film. What makes this so odd to me is that the first time I saw it, after having seen `Manhattan', I really did not think it was as good as the later film.My initially low opinion of the movie was primarily due to the numerous cinematic gimmicks harking back to his earlier, plainly less thoughtful movies. These include flashbacks to dopey teachers and classmates, almost as a parody of Jean Shepherd; subtitles showing what the characters are really thinking of one another during a conversation; a cartoon segment where Allen and the Tony Roberts character appear with the wicked witch from Snow White; speeches to the audience; and the most famous, a surprise appearance by Marshall McCluhan in a movie theatre lobby to refute a college instructor pontificating about McCluhan's ideas.The single most famous scene from the movie is the encounter between Allen's character, Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, played brilliantly by Diane Keaton, after their tennis match with Annie dressed in her classic layered look with vest, men's tie, and balloonish trousers. The great sound bite from this encounter is the Annie Hall exclamation `La Di Dah, La Di Dah, Dah Dah...' and Singer's reaction wondering how he could be interested in anyone making such silly exclamations. From this one scene came a whole late 1970's fashion trend, the `Annie Hall' look of layered, mannish clothes. This scene also sets the stage for my latest insight into the movie, which is the progression of Annie, with a lot of help from Alvy, from an unserious girl with a decent singing voice to a serious woman with a few good ideas and a connection to a serious Hollywood music personality, played convincingly by Paul Simon with an eye to having her performances commercially recorded.While so much can be said of the loves, frustrations, and disappointments of Alvy Singer, the movie is, after all, named `Annie Hall', not `Alvy Singer'. Not to say that this incarnation of the Woody Allen fictional persona is not central to the story. In the story of Alvy Singer that frames our encounter with Annie, there are encounters with two early marriages to characters played by Carol Kane and Janet Margolin, plus less than exciting romantic encounters with Shelley Duvall. The Allen talent for pulling in major actors and future major actors for brief appearances is in full bloom. There are excellent little parts for Colleen Dewhurst and Christopher Walken. There are even smaller parts for surprise appearances by Jeff Goldblum, Sigourney Weaver, and Beverly De'Angelis. Just as Allen is playing his usual, highly autobiographical character, male costar Tony Roberts plays the typically untroubled successful male who is constantly on the make for something or other, whether it be a business deal of a romantic laision. (It just occurred to me that it is logical that Roberts did not play the male costar in `Manhattan', as the Michael Murphy character simply did not fit the typical Tony Roberts character as it appears in `Play It Again, Sam', `A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy', and `Annie Hall'.While I have not reviewed all of Allen's later movies, I will venture the opinion that not only is `Annie Hall' better than all the films which precede it, it is as good or better than his best later movies (such as `Hannah and Her Sisters', `Crimes and Misdemeanors', and `Husbands and Wives'), if only because it is so effective a mix of both character study and humor. Some of Allen's jokes from this movie are some of his best known. In fact, I get the same sense watching this movie as I do when I see `Hamlet'. So many lines sound like clich&eacute;s because they have been so widely quoted.There are a lot of things which could be said about this movie which are really about themes which run through almost all of Allen's films such as doting on sexuality, phony intellectuality, love of Manhattan, and death. One clever riff on death is when Annie is moving into Alvy's apartment, Alvy discovers a book of Sylvia Plath's poems, which contradicts Hall's later statement when she is moving out that all the books about death were given to her by Singer. (Plath was a famously depressive poet who committed suicide in mid-career).Allen's movie DVDs are uniformly free of fancy extras such as commentary tracks and `Making of' documentaries, and this is no exception. At the risk of repeating myself, I will say that the singular attraction of Allen's body of work in general and `Annie Hall' in particular is its rewatchability. As unrealistic as the many cinematic gimmicks are, the characters are intensely real. They are people with which we can sincerely associate. Try that with your usual Ben Stiller character.Highly recommended classic among both Allen movies and all movies in general.",5,"Continually rewarding, ever funny, rich and warm.

His self-analytical persona was perfect for the growingly narcissistic American public and the way he introduced the audience into the storyline of his films by intermittently turning towards the screen as though it were a person and engaging the viewer with questions and comments was nothing short of pure genius (The legendary Bob Hope made use of this active audience participation technique years earlier but not to the extent and effectiveness as Woody).While my particular favorite Woody Allen film happens to be `Love and Death released in '75, I can see why `Annie Hall' is by-in-large the film most people will point to as his apex in filmmaking. It really is the ultimate American comedy containing all the 20th century angst his name as become synonymous with; fear of failure, fear of success, fear of relationships, fear of being alone, fear of an ever-expanding universe.

275414,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,6301963911,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[13, 17]","Annie Hall was a turning point for Woody toward more 'serious' and somewhat autobiobraphical films.  It remains his most popular film and won 4 Accademy Awards.The way Allen combined his New York characters with sharp satirical comments on everything from intellectual phoniness, racism and sexual angst to shared experiences like standing in line at the movies was new, fresh and original.He re-invented the modern romantic comedy and his style has been much imitated ever since. I could see Annie Hall's influence recently in Tao of Steve.Allen was not giving us a romantic feel good romance like a Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan film.  And he's certainly not a charismatic or even charming leading man.  This was an awkward, warts and all romance which was sometimes uncomfortable to watch.The film begins with Allen as Alvy Singer talking directing to the camera and explaining that he's quite upset because he's broken up with Annie.  (It doesn't quite match up, time wise when we get to the end of the film-but then the time-line throughout the film is toyed with in the style of Fellini's 8 1/2). He says:&quot;  The other important joke for me is one that's usually attributed to Groucho Marx but I think it appears originally in Freud's wit and its relation to the unconscious - and it goes like this. I'm paraphrasing. I would never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member. That's the key joke of my adult life, in terms of my relationships with women.&quot;Alvy Singer is Allen's alter-ego -a stand up comic and Allen's quintessential New York character. This pessimistic, paranoid, is too smart to be a naive romantic, but yearns to be exactly that.  He's always a fish out of water, because he is not comfortable with his own thoughts and can not accept either his good qualities nor his bad ones.  So he's forever going to be in analysis.  He is impatient with everyone-including himself and has to whine about everything that bothers him.  He has a propensity to say the wrong thing at the wrong time and to wait too long to say the right thing.  He'll let something slip out of his mouth uncensored, and when he tries to soften it, he only makes it worse.  Yet he actually means no harm.  He's merely rejecting everything he can before it ultimately rejects him.  His fears and paranoias are worn on his sleeve.  He'll not be hurt, because who would want to get past all his `stuff' to really get to know him and have an opportunity to hurt him.  He wears his inferiority complex as both a security blanket and a suit of armor.And then there is Annie.  A women who is utterly vulnerable, yet extremely tough.  Someone who refuses to be pessimistic but is ready for a change because the path she has been on has not led to anything or anyone substantial.  Maybe Alvy is perfect for her.  Annie is smart, but not as intellectual or well read as Alvy.  She's a bundle of scattered energy and feels the need to smoke dope before she has sex.  She's full of insecurities but she's trying to over come them, not wear them like a security blanket. Annie lacks confidence, but she isn't afraid.  She doesn't believe in herself, but she knows she should and really wants to.  She knows she needs to grow and change and she knows Alvy might help her do that-even if as she grows and change she leaves Alvy behind.And so we have the bittersweet romance. And it's because the film is first about the romance and then about Allen's obsessions and interests that made the film his most popular.Nearly all of the film's scenes are laugh out loud funny.  Some are laying bare the relationship, some are exposing Alvy's neuroses or forcing us to recognize how ridiculous people can be. Some are full brilliant comic inventiveness-such as when the class room of kids stand up and as little kids, with children's voices tell us what they are doing now.  One is a plumber, another is a junkie, another is into leather.Annie Hall may be full of sharp observance but it keeps its distance from the audience with it's almost too clever gimmicks.  Woody breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the camera several times during the film. He uses surrealistic gags, and even a brief animated sequence in the film.  He even has Paul Simon playing a record producer who really likes Annie Hall.  We get several New York versus Los Angeles jokes, that seem a bit stale now. We also get the funny subtitle scene.  Annie Hall is less personal and intimate than Allen's next film would be (Manhattan)but it's a little funnier.And let's not forget the film also had an  amazing fashion influence.  The Annie Hall look is still with us.OF INTEREST:The relationship between Alvy and Annie is full of easy to make real life parallels.  The film's title  incorporates Diane Keaton's real name- Diane Hall and her nickname Annie.Carol Kane has a small role as Alvy's first wife.Christopher Walken has a small role playing Annie Hall's brother who confesses having suicidal thoughts to Alvy.Jeff Goldblum is seen briefly, but memorably as part of the Los Angeles party scene.  He is on the phone and says: &quot;I forgot my mantra.&quot;Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder Available End of January 2001.

275416,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,6301963911,C. Middleton,"[5, 5]","Woody Allen's professional integrity has held fast for over a quarter century. Commercial concerns have never deterred the artist from pushing through on a particular idea or project. It is well known that over the many years of filmmaking, he created an insular production company and connected himself to people (producers) who would accept any film proposal on face value - sometimes merely on the bases of one telephone conversation. In some cases, Allen's films were great successes, 'Hannah and Her Sisters' and 'Crimes and Misdemeanours', but sometimes his ideas didn't pan out and the picture lost money. Woody Allen is often quoted as saying, ""If I don't like something, it doesn't matter how many awards it's won. It's important to keep your own criteria and not defer to the trends of the marketplace."" (Allen never attended the Oscars during the 70's 80' and 90's because his band performed in New York on Monday nights.) When ~Annie Hall~ opened in the late seventies, the studio was nervous. In fact they didn't know what to make of this strange picture, but decided to take a chance anyway. ~Annie~ turned out to be a commercial and critical success, which also launched Diane Keaton as a major Hollywood star.This is not just a good film but a great film. Every scene has at least three to four gags that seem to never grow stale. When Alvie Singer (Woody Allen) meets Annie for the first time, she's obviously quite nervous and fills the pregnant silences with ""La ti da, la ti da..."" He says, ""I'm dating a woman who says, ""La ti da"". This reminded me of Seinfeld's famous, ""Yada yada yada..."" Allen's wit runs hot and fast in this film and one has to pay close attention to catch all the great lines. One of my favourites is a short conversation about the media that Alvie has with his ex wife, Robin:Robin: ""I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.""""Commentary""Alvie: 'Oh really? I heard that Commentary and Dissent merged and formedDysentery.""In comedies particularly, the chemistry between the actors is essential for the joke and scene to work. The chemistry between Keaton and Allen has now become legendary. In the hilarious ""Lobster"" scene, you can tell they really like each other and have a lot of fun, on and off screen. They were of course once a couple, but they continue to be great friends and attribute their professional and creative successes to each other.

275417,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,6301963911,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[0, 0]","Annie Hall had a very interesting production. Woody first set out to make a surrealistic exploration called Anhedonia, a film chronicling the inner working of Alvy's mind. It was a sprawling, absurd, philosophical, murder-mystery/sci-fi/comedy which hinged strongly on stream-of-consciousness. The editor, Ralph Rosenblum, considered it a mess, and with Woody's guidance, carved out it's most engaging side plot: Alvy's relationship with Annie Hall. Taking this into account, it's a miracle that the film works (and is considered a masterpiece). The stream-of-consciousness/absurdist style was kept, but the tone was changed to that of a romantic comedy. This makes for a very interesting combination of sarcastic observational humor and innovative storytelling. That being said, it's not a perfect film, and at time it seems like Anhedonia is trying to take over the film but then another scene with Diane Keaton keeps it from going completely off the rails. Yes, it's self-indulgence, essentially Woody Allen psychoanalyzing himself for the public, but he's fully aware of it, we're fully aware of it, he gets to keep making movies and his audience is rewarded with entertaining and smart comedy. It's a wonder how Annie Hall is his most famous film to date though, as it seems like just another peg in his never-ending line of 90 minute witticisms. Nevertheless, it does have a number of his most memorable scenes, a fantastic cast, great photography, and a fast style.",4,Anhedonia Hall,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1472,"['Annie', 'Hall', 'had', 'very', 'interesting', 'production', 'Woody', 'first', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'surrealistic', 'exploration', 'called', 'Anhedonia', 'film', 'chronicling', 'inner', 'working', 'Alvy', 'mind', 'was', 'sprawling', 'absurd', 'philosophical', 'murder-mystery/sci-fi/comedy', 'hinged', 'strongly', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'editor', 'Ralph', 'Rosenblum', 'considered', 'mess', 'Woody', 'guidance', 'carved', 'out', 'most', 'engaging', 'side', 'plot', 'Alvy', 'relationship', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Taking', 'account', 'miracle', 'film', 'works', 'considered', 'masterpiece', 'stream-of-consciousness/absurdist', 'style', 'was', 'kept', 'tone', 'was', 'changed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'very', 'interesting', 'combination', 'sarcastic', 'observational', 'humor', 'innovative', 'storytelling', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'time', 'Anhedonia', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'film', 'then', 'scene', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'going', 'completely', 'rails', 'Yes', 'self-indulgence', 'essentially', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'psychoanalyzing', 'public', 'fully', 'aware', ""'re"", 'fully', 'aware', 'keep', 'making', 'movies', 'audience', 'rewarded', 'entertaining', 'smart', 'comedy', 'wonder', 'how', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'most', 'famous', 'film', 'date', 'though', 'just', 'peg', 'never-ending', 'line', '90', 'minute', 'witticisms', 'Nevertheless', 'have', 'number', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'great', 'photography', 'fast', 'style']",N/A

I watched it because it was on the AFI's list of the greatest 100 films, and I'm trying to watch all of them.  When the list was first released, I had seen 57 of the films.  Now, I'm up to 77.  I have found some real gems while watching these films.  &quot;All About Eve,&quot; &quot;The Apartment,&quot; and &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; are all marvelous films that I've watched recently.  Then I got &quot;Annie Hall.&quot;I guess I've always resisted watching this movie because it was awarded the Oscar for Best Picture over &quot;Star Wars.&quot;  That, and I really don't like Woody Allen.  I'd seen &quot;Sleeper&quot; several years ago, and I thought it was mildly amusing.  There were a few chuckles in &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; but the only time I really laughed was when Allen sneezed $2000 worth of cocaine into the air at a party.The plot of the film is almost non-existant, but this is really a character-driven film anyway.  The only problem with this is that I really didn't identify with any of the characters.  Not only that, but I didn't like them.  Allen's character is just a neurotic, self-centered mess, and Annie Hall is irritatingly dim-witted.  She just goes whichever way the wind blows her.Another reviewer here remarked that this film was 2 and half hours.  It is actually just a little over one and a half hours; it only seems like 2 and a half.

I felt it was great film in the way it presented Annie and Alvy as a mismatched, but lovable couple. I thought that Woody Allenaccomplished this by his innovative use of narrative. He broke thestandards in order to bring me closer to both main characters.One technique, which I noticed from the start of the film, wasthat Allen spoke directly to the camera. This made me feel that he wasdirectly speaking to me; I became a part of the conversation. Anotherscene which I particularly liked was when he brought Marshall McLuhanfrom behind the poster stand to insult the Columbia professor. I wasthinking that this would be the ideal situation. I oftentimes get intoarguments which I can't win, even though I am positively in the right. I was able to identify with Alvy's frustration simply because he looked at me and said,&quot;Boy, if life were only like this&quot;. And I responded right back,&quot;You're right&quot;.I was also in conflict as to who I was suppose to like better. Ithink that I was more sympathetic toward Annie because Allenconsistently showed me Alvy's hypocritical mannerisms and continualattempts at controlling her life. For instance, when Alvy criticizes Annie's adult education, the screen cuts to a previous scene where Alvy praises adult education. I began to resent Alvy's lack of understanding and bigotry.Also, I realized that the title of the film was Annie Hall. Thus,the focus was on Annie through Alvy's eyes. At the end of the film, Alvyand Annie are shown from a distance. As they say goodbye to oneanother, flashbacks of their relationship are shown. Also, there isbackground music: Annie sings &quot;Seems like Old Times&quot;. The last person inthe film is Alvy. The last voice in the film is Annie. I became more linked to Annie because of the musical playback.

Where the movement of the classic rom-com is the union of two mismatched lovers, the kiss, marriage - a forward movement which is' in effect' sexual sublimation - 'Annie Hall' begins with its romance's break-up, and proceeds with a vignette narrative structure, in which time and space are fragmented: far from gathering any momentum, the film, with is modest highs and lows, kind of peters out, just like romance in real-life.'Annie Hall' is, as everyone knows, the first truly great Woody Allen movie.  All the cherishable elements from his previous films are here - the nervy wisecracks (which, far from containing life's anguish, seem to helplessly acknowledge the impossibility of ever doing so); the visual and narrative trickery; the flippant allusions etc. - but are given depth and feeling by the focus on character.  The opening monologue sets the tone - Alvy's stand-up routine (an address to the public) as confession (private): this is a relationship constantly being pushed into social situations (family, parties, night classes etc.).The movements through time and space, the documentary feel for real locations, the recognition of the emotional import of seemingly trivial events, all combine to create a complex picture of people alive and in love in a particular place and time.  In the case of Alvy especially, these elements serve to reveal the character his joking is at pains to deflect.The film is the closest American film every came to the spontaneity of the French New Wave, without being cripplingly self-conscious about it - the inventive chopping between visual registers and narrative moods; the romanticising of city life; the seemingly casual, but crucial and resonant, allusions to films, books, music etc.; the satire of cultural pretensions; above all, the very modern, elusive relationship at its centre - all creating a film as fresh, funny and poignant as the day it was made, one done a great disservice by its sappy imitators.

Annie Hall, his seventh film, introduces themes that would be featured in his later films, including Manhattan. The nature of love is a repeating subject for Allen and co-star Tony Roberts described this film as ""the story of everybody who falls in love, and then falls out of love and goes on."" Alvy searches for love's purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise of his relationship with Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that ""It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades,"" a suggestion that it was no one's fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable.[35] By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately ""irrational and crazy and absurd"", but a necessity of life. wikipediaI save you all the rest, the prizes won, the profit made, the favorable comments made: I just recommend that you see the film.

But nothing beats a perfectly written script (courtesy of Allen and frequent collaborator Marshall Brickman) and the undeniable chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton in the title role. Scene for scene, it represents the most consistently engaging comedy Allen ever directed, and his wonderfully creative stream-of-consciousness narrative is filled to the brim with detours into flashbacks, animation, split-screens, fantasy scenes and speaking to the camera. It all blends into a movie that remains emotionally resonant and even bittersweet behind all the laughs.There is little plot to speak of as it focuses on the evolving relationship between Alvy Singer, a successful stand-up comedian, and Annie Hall, an aspiring singer. Interspersed throughout are episodes in Alvy's angst-driven life - his shaky childhood next to the Coney Island rollercoaster, his desultory days as a comedy writer, his previous failures in relationships and marriages, his ongoing resistance to the West Coast. No longer playing just the romantic loser of ""Play It Again, Sam"", Allen is constantly kvetching in his search for intellectual fulfillment but finally finds his first true love in his diametric opposite, an unaffected, self-deprecating girl from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Their relationship is played out in clever episodes, none more so than their first meeting at a tennis game followed by Annie's reckless driving and a subtitled conversation on her terrace. It is really the contrast in their approach to life that brings them together and provides the impetus for their dissolution.Whether she is playing herself or not, Keaton is an unadulterated joy even as her character sadly grows apart from Alvy. Allen is himself or at least his public persona and even manages a sense of unexpected pathos toward the end, especially when he desperately proposes marriage at the health food restaurant. There are so many memorable moments that it's difficult to choose a favorite - Marshall McLuhan at the movies, the lobsters, the sneeze into the cocaine, Christopher Walken's bit as Annie's headlight-obsessed brother Duane. A movie as perfect as this deserves a deluxe DVD treatment, but the 2000 release has simply a decent print transfer and unfortunately only the original trailer as an extra.

But his pseuo-intellectual pretentiousness annoyed me, and I don't really care for his poses and his repetion of the cliche about not wanting to belong to a club (or woman) that would accept him.

""Sleeper"" really lives up (or should I say down) to its name and after that I didn't think I'd risk another Allen flick until I watched this one.  Allen plays the neurotic romantic self-sabotager role very well and watching his attempts at getting the ultimate chalk and cheese relationship to work was amusing for the most part and hilarious in a few of the scenes that actually managed to age pretty well over the last 30 years.The only beef I have with this dvd version of the film is that the picture quality is very poor with numerous imperfections throughout such as black circles, spots etc on many frames and the very poor sound quality which comes in mono.  Thankfully, in a film like this where sound effects matter little and it's the dialogue that makes this one great, one's overall enjoyment isn't diminished too much but if they are thinking of doing a Director's Cut of this film or if they are looking at putting this on Blu-ray, they should take the opportunity to clean up both the picture and the sound quality with a 5.1 surround sound option as well as with good Special Features to boot.Overall this is Woody Allen at his best in a film that only he could make and I actually enjoyed it a great deal but you should wait until they release a better dvd version in either standard or Blu-ray formats but with better Special Features and much, much better picture and sound quality options preferably in a new Director's Cut.",2,Allen's Finest!

275439,A2BPDFR58H9575,6301963911,Galina,"[1, 1]","I have been a huge fan of Allen's works for years and I've seen every movie he's made. Strangely, Annie Hall, the most celebrated and universally considered THE Best Woody Allen's movie ever, did not belong to the top list of my favorite Allen's films. It took me three times to watch it and finally I can say yes, it is indeed a marvelous film, one of the best romantic stories told from the screen, the love story that could've only been made by Woody Allen. Its tag line says ""A nervous romance"", and they never came more nervous than Annie Hall. This is a story of two people who truly loved each their but could not stay together and moved on with their lives. Simple like that but it was told by Woody Allen, what made it not so simple and very enjoyable. This is the film where Diane Keaton had proved a perfect actress for Allen's movies. She brought to the film a lot of herself, her natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role, even her dressing style that became hugely popular, and she was able to look at herself from the distance. She played Annie with such elegance, bemusement, perfect timing, and sense of humor, that for the whole time I kept asking myself how she did it. The part of the answer is that Allen understood her completely and masterfully used the originality of her persona to write and direct the character of Annie. Keaton recalls, ""Of course I recognized myself in the roles Woody Allen wrote. I mean, in Annie Hall (1977) particularly. I was this sort of novice who had lots of feelings but didn't know how to express herself, and I see that in Annie. I think Woody used a kind of essential quality that he found in me at that time, and I'm glad he did because it worked really well in the movie.""For Annie Hall, Allen received his first and only nomination for acting, and he deserved it. You may say that you've seen all his tricks many times but Annie Hall was the first movie where he mixed physical comedy, anxiety, and neurosis with the genuine feelings of love and nostalgia so touchingly and funny. Engaging the audience to the film by talking directly to them may not be used for the first time ever by Allen but it worked perfectly in Annie Hall. Who would forget the scene in the ticket booth in an art house movie cinema where Woody summons up Marshall McLuhan to silence a never stop talking self important movie critic? The flashbacks are smart and funny, the split screen Allen uses, really added to the characters' understanding by comparison two parallel streams of thought. Both, NYC and its antitheses, LA look gorgeous. Even the smallest cameos are memorable (Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum, for example).I think that the fascination and love that the film received upon its release had to do a lot with the fact that it was so different from everything Allen had done before Annie Hall. Checking the list of his earlier movies, one can't help noticing that they were pure slapstick comedies. The only earlier film that can be called Annie Hall's true predecessor is the one that Allen did not direct even though he wrote it, starred in it and for the first time shared the screen with Diane Keaton - Play it Again, Sam. I still believe that Allen has made films better than Annie Hall, at least I love 'Manhattan"", ""Hanna and Her Sisters', ""Zelig"", and especially ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" more and place them above Annie Hall. But as the first Allen's romantic dramedy, the one that had started the whole genre of independent and sophisticated urban love stories with an unusual, over self-involved and self-obsessed and not always likable lead hero who nevertheless is always ready to be the first to laugh at himself and to look at himself from the distance, Annie Hall has found the high place in the film history.Critics have compared Annie Hall to Fellini's 8 1/2 but Woody responded in his typical way that ""it's more like my 2 1/2"". The members of the academy did not think so, and rewarded the film with 5 Oscar nominations, of which it won four, making Annie Hall one of very few comedies to have won Best Picture of the year Oscar and the shortest ever Oscar winner - 93 precious minutes of Woody Allen's genius and Diane Keaton's charm.",5,A major turning point,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,4221,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Allen', 'works', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'made', 'Strangely', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'most', 'celebrated', 'universally', 'considered', 'THE', 'Best', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'ever', 'did', 'not', 'belong', 'top', 'list', 'favorite', 'Allen', 'films', 'took', 'three', 'times', 'watch', 'finally', 'can', 'say', 'yes', 'indeed', 'marvelous', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'stories', 'told', 'screen', 'love', 'story', 'could', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'made', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'tag', 'line', 'A', 'nervous', 'romance', 'never', 'came', 'more', 'nervous', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'loved', 'could', 'not', 'stay', 'together', 'moved', 'lives', 'Simple', 'was', 'told', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'what', 'made', 'not', 'so', 'simple', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'where', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'had', 'proved', 'perfect', 'actress', 'Allen', 'movies', 'brought', 'film', 'lot', 'herself', 'natural', 'nervousness', 'insecure', 'attitude', 'role', 'even', 'dressing', 'style', 'became', 'hugely', 'popular', 'was', 'able', 'look', 'distance', 'played', 'Annie', 'such', 'elegance', 'bemusement', 'perfect', 'timing', 'sense', 'humor', 'whole', 'time', 'kept', 'asking', 'how', 'did', 'part', 'answer', 'Allen', 'understood', 'completely', 'masterfully', 'used', 'originality', 'persona', 'write', 'direct', 'character', 'Annie', 'Keaton', 'course', 'recognized', 'roles', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'wrote', 'mean', 'Annie', 'Hall', '1977', 'particularly', 'was', 'sort', 'novice', 'who', 'had', 'lots', 'feelings', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'express', 'see', 'Annie', 'think', 'Woody', 'used', 'kind', 'essential', 'quality', 'found', 'time', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'movie', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Allen', 'received', 'first', 'only', 'nomination', 'acting', 'deserved', 'may', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tricks', 'many', 'times', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'where', 'mixed', 'physical', 'comedy', 'anxiety', 'neurosis', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'love', 'nostalgia', 'so', 'touchingly', 'funny', 'Engaging', 'audience', 'film', 'talking', 'directly', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'Allen', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Who', 'would', 'forget', 'scene', 'ticket', 'booth', 'art', 'house', 'movie', 'cinema', 'where', 'Woody', 'up', 'Marshall', 'McLuhan', 'silence', 'never', 'stop', 'talking', 'important', 'movie', 'critic', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'smart', 'funny', 'split', 'screen', 'Allen', 'really', 'added', 'characters', 'understanding', 'comparison', 'two', 'parallel', 'streams', 'thought', 'NYC', 'antitheses', 'LA', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'Even', 'smallest', 'cameos', 'are', 'memorable', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'example', 'think', 'fascination', 'love', 'film', 'received', 'release', 'had', 'do', 'lot', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'everything', 'Allen', 'had', 'done', 'before', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Checking', 'list', 'earlier', 'movies', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'noticing', 'were', 'pure', 'slapstick', 'comedies', 'only', 'earlier', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'true', 'predecessor', 'one', 'Allen', 'did', 'not', 'direct', 'even', 'wrote', 'starred', 'first', 'time', 'shared', 'screen', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Play', 'Again', 'Sam', 'still', 'believe', 'Allen', 'made', 'films', 'better', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'least', 'love', 'Hanna', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'Zelig', 'especially', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'more', 'place', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'first', 'Allen', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'one', 'had', 'started', 'whole', 'genre', 'independent', 'sophisticated', 'urban', 'love', 'stories', 'unusual', 'self-involved', 'self-obsessed', 'not', 'always', 'likable', 'lead', 'hero', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'always', 'ready', 'be', 'first', 'laugh', 'look', 'distance', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'found', 'high', 'place', 'film', 'history.Critics', 'have', 'compared', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Fellini', '8', '1/2', 'Woody', 'responded', 'typical', 'way', 'more', '2', '1/2', 'members', 'academy', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'rewarded', 'film', '5', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'won', 'four', 'making', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'comedies', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year', 'Oscar', 'shortest', 'ever', 'Oscar', 'winner', '93', 'precious', 'minutes', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'genius', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'charm']",N/A

It's funnily sad, not sadly funny, which is probably the best way to look back. Diane Keaton and the supporting cast all work well together. It's not at all dated.I laughed a whole lot through it and it is honest in its depiction of how a relationship doesn't necessarily need some major drama to end - sometimes, it's just time to go, and the getting out is tough. In that sense, I found this movie surprisingly realistic, and wish more movies would explore this less exciting, but equally interesting dimension of human relationships.What isn't realistic, however, is how TOTALLY GORGEOUS the cinematography is.

It is relatively short--about 1 1/2 hours, but packed full of laughs.  Woody is Alvy Singer and reminisces about his lost true love, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).  The movie is full of scenes depicting his times with Annie.  Alvy is a somewhat ""nerdy"" comic writer and falls for Annie, a mid-west, part-time photographer.  In one scene Alvy tries to boil live lobsters, but they are crawling all over the floor---just fun to watch!  One skit, where Alvy and Annie wait in line for a movie and a ""know-it-all"" guy in back of them tries to quote and analyze movies and media gurus.  Alvy goes and pulls out Marshall McCluhan from out of nowhere and McCluhan tells the ""know-it-all"" he's full of crap and doesn't know what he's talking about.

He suggests us the concept so many times repeated : the happiness is just a lovely , funny and poetic vignettes colection , but beware about to reach this utopic state for a long time .We must laugh before being happy ; otherwise we can die without having laughed .Since Woody and Diane are two isolated human beings in that overwhelming city in which you need to have a center in the mythical sense . They meet and feel that invisible chemistry ; plenty of reciprocal armonies and shared glances .New York is once more a monumental and changing background to express the greatness and the unability to vibrate to the same frenetic rhtym this city beats .Thet decide to live together and slowly as a sugessting adagio they remeet they learn the fugacity of the relationship ; the incompatibility of characters and these little diferences which progressively grow and become a invisible barrier where they acquire a new profile of loneliness due to the limits in their emotional spheres . They love themselves but no more than their independence .Nevertheless Allen knew to avoid to fall in the so well known clich&eacute; and builds a brilliant ending for both of them .At last Allen will reveal as a guy filled with new hopes , recognizing his inner weakness and wishing her the best .But the form in which this romantic drama will develop its own flight is so original and well done that you can not forget it at all and like the good books this cult movie lives with you , and your memories . In particular I must confess I watch it once or twice every year .The other point to remark is the fundamental concerns given for Allen is in the air .

Annie and Alvy Singer (Allen's character) soon fall in lust, and the movie explores what happens when the sex and novelty of the relationship wear off.Alvy soon displays the stock trait of Allen's persona: Neurotic perfectionism. Very set in his ways, he becomes frazzled when Annie (and in flashbacks) the other women in his life venture outside the rigid routines Alvy has set in stone.Another paradox that manifests itself is Allen's classic disdain for political conservatives (targets of his ire are Eisenhower, William F.

I decided to rent it because it is on the list of the American Film Institute's 100 most funny movies (in fact, it is very high on the list!).  My expectations were to laugh out loud.  I viewed it in one room while my husband worked in another.  Afterward I went in to the room where he was and asked him if he had heard me laughing.  He said, &quot;No...&quot;  I said, &quot;Exactly.&quot;My biggest complaint, ironically, is that this is a negative movie.  Woody Allen's jokes can be very clever, but I ended up feeling so sorry for his character and his character's outlook on life, that I had a hard time laughing.  I did smile at the runaway lobster scene.  That was my favorite, because it had nothing to do with unhappiness.  The lobster hid behind the refrigerator and Woody Allen said that he would put some butter at one side and the lobster would run out the other.Woody as his character (Alvy Singer) said there are two kinds of people in the world, the miserable, and even worse (like suicidal).  I really felt sorry for him  - his character's outlook on life really hurt him and his relationships.If you want to watch this movie to see some failures in relationships, that would be a reason to watch it.

275457,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,6301963911,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[1, 2]","Woody Allen transitioned from a very funny writer/actor/director, to a truly brilliant filmmaker with ""Annie Hall."" I saw this landmark movie again and was amazed at how well it holds up over time, and how pristine the film looks on DVD. Like Allen's earlier works, this is hilariously funny, but beneath the humor lies a poignant love story of two mismatched, neurotic people. It is a focused film that takes a mature look at modern urban relationships. The witty, clever screenplay is one of the reasons for its enduring popularity, regardless of the audience's demographics.Alvy Singer, (Woody Allen), is a pessimistic, insecure, angst-ridden, short, Jewish New Yorker, originally from Brooklyn, just like Mr. Allen. Obviously, there are autobiographical elements here. Singer used to be a gag writer for comedians, but made a career decision to do his own comic stand-up routine. When we meet him for the first time, he has already become a star...and is still very neurotic. ""Life is full of loneliness, misery, suffering, and unhappiness - and it's all over much too quickly,"" he says. Singer has a spurt of good luck, however, when he meets ditsy, charming Annie Hall, originally from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Diane Keaton is outstanding in the role - she won an Academy Award for Best Actress, and began a funky clothes trend with her wardrobe that lasted for a few years. If Alvy is New York seeded rye bread, then Annie is a somewhat tightly-wound, Wonder Bread WASP. She actually orders a pastrami sandwich on white bread with mayo in a local deli - that's like ordering fettuccine with ketchup in an Italian trattoria. It's a wonder that when the two have their first conversation they don't go into instant culture shock. Alvy may have poor self esteem, but Annie sure does like him. They appear to be having a wonderful time together too, as in the scene where they chase live lobsters around the kitchen floor, trying to cook a seafood dinner. Alvy's anhedonia, (the inability to enjoy oneself), seems to abandon him temporarily as the romance flourishes.""Annie Hall"" gets much of its comedy from mundane, everyday occurrences. I actually wonder if Jerry Seinfeld didn't derive some inspiration for his hit sitcom from Allen's film. One of the more brilliant scenes occurs when Singer goes to Annie's apartment, for the first time, right after they meet, for a drink and some getting-to-know-you conversation. As they make small talk, sub-titles appear on the screen, stating what the two are actually thinking: Alvy: ""I wonder what she looks like naked,"" Annie: ""He's too smart for me; hang in there."" There is also an outrageous split screen sequence of Annie and Alvie in therapy sessions, with their respective shrinks, discussing their relationship. His therapist asks if they have sex often, hers asks the same. He replies, ""Hardly ever! Maybe three times a week."" Annie responds, ""Constantly! I'd say three times a week."" Also fantastic are the wacky sequences with Annie's Midwestern family, (Colleen Dewhurst is wonderful as Annie's mother, and Christopher Walken, her spooky brother, is beyond weird). Singer comments on how different his Brooklyn family is from her Midwestern relations. Then the screen splits and we see Annie's family talking quietly over dinner, while Alvy's boisterous family, bicker over their Passover meal. As the romance progresses, Alvy's previous relationships with wives numbers 1 and 2 are depicted through a series of flashbacks.There are problems and rough spots, as with most relationships. Alvy keeps trying to turn Annie into the woman he wants her to be. When he pushes her to go back to college and take some classes, she gains new confidence - and develops a crush on one of her professors. The plot thickens when Annie meets a hit record producer who offers her a job in Los Angeles. Alvy goes along, temporarily, to do a TV special. One of Woody Allen's pet peeves is California, and life on the left coast, as compared to life in NYC, so you can bet there is plenty of scathing commentary about Hollywood. Although many know how Annie and Alvy wind up, I won't spoil it for those who don't. However, if you have not seen ""Annie Hall,"" you are really missing something phenomenal. And if you have seen it, and don't have it in your DVD collection, you might want to reconsider.The film is done in non-linear form, and Allen's use of split screens techniques, animated characters, direct-to-camera narration, and occasional subtitles, are extremely effective, creative and innovative. Allen won Oscars for Best Director and Best Screenplay, and was nominated for Best Actor for ""Annie Hall."" There are cameos by: Christopher Walken, Shelley Duvall, Carol Kane, Janet Margolin, Marshall MacLuhan, Dick Cavet, John Glover, Jeff Goldblum, Beverly D'Angelo and Sigourney Weaver.So what is the point of this fabulous movie, besides lots of laughs and terrific acting? Well, Groucho Marx used to say, ""I'd never belong to a club that would have someone like me as a member."" The primary message here is that to be loved, one has to love oneself first. Of course Woody Allen is also saying that love is annoying and pointless, as are relationships in general - but we need them.JANA",5,Woody Allen's Landmark Film - Hilarously Funny &

Woody Allen breaks many cliche barriers and has created an excellent film.  I recommend this one to anybody who likes comedy.  Watch for appearences by Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken.

The first time I saw this absolutely wonderful film, I had mixed feelings, because I was not expecting Woody Allen's innovative camera works, dialogue, and references to literary works, since very few films use those kind of assets. However, when I watched it again, I fell in love with it. It's so bittersweet and tangible, that it's nearly impossible not to relate. It's a wholesomely feel-good film, and one feels happy and sad while watching it. We examine every depth of Alvy and Annie's relationship, and during the process, we become entwined with their lives, and we feel along with them. The dialogue is clever, hilarious, and at times sad and poignant, if not unbelievably relevant to the everyday routine of people's lives. The last lines of this film: ""This guy goes to the doctor and says, 'Doc, my brother's crazy. He thinks he's a chicken.' and the doc says, 'Well, why don't you turn him in? 'I would, but I need the eggs.' That's exactly how I feel about relationships now. They're totally irritational and crazy, yet we keep going through them because most of us need the eggs."" God, what a wonderful line. It's a PERFECT explanation of why we go through painful relationships and keep searching for reasons why we do. This film takes a close look at every aspect of people's lives. Infidelity, friends, jobs, religions, relationships, drugs, futures, insecurities, people's feelings, families, death, fantasy, pasts....ALL IN ALL, Annie Hall is truly one of the most beautiful, poignant works of the era. It is IMPOSSIBLE to emulate this piece of perfection. Do WHATEVER you have to do to see this. You'll never forgive yourselves if you choose to watch flaccid pieces of films and pass over ANNIE HALL.

My wife and I got about three-fourths of the way through it before turning off the TV. We just couldn't listen to the miserable talking heads any longer.The previous film we watched was directed by Allen, but he did not act in it. In Annie Hall, he plays the lead actor, and basically subjects the viewer to an endless barrage of complaining and bad sense of style and taste. Diane Keaton plays Annie, who despite the forced concept that she's articulate, intelligent and well-rounded she presents herself as often aloof and simple.The whole movie is just talking heads. Talking, talking, and more talking. The dated style of the seventies took us by surprise - all the men in this film appear to be slobs in cheap suits with careless looking hair (as noted by my wife with my agreement).The premise I suppose is that Woody Allen is cute in some way, and attractive too. But as my wife pointed out, he's a ""nebbish"" (a nerd), and it just felt so fake. I'd say about half of the injected jokes were far from funny. Its also fun to note that in the movie poster Allen appears taller than his girl, but in the film he walks quite shorter.As a reality check, this film was watched by two thirty year-olds in the year 2009, and the story is about a forty-something guy in the year 1975 (I believe), so we weren't quite born when this film was considered Best Movie Of The Year.

It's when Woody Allen visits the LA home of some stereotypical Hollywood types and we see a young Jeff Goldblum on the phone with his guru telling him ""I forgot my mantra"". I laughed at that. As for the rest, it's pretty much garbage. Woody Allen is so disgusting to even look at, never mind listen to, that the movie is almost impossible to endure. I know he's only a memory these days, but how did the world tolerate him in his prime? How did he become a success? I understand that New York and LA are full of his kind of people, but did he really have an audience in the rest of the country? If so, I think it must have been made up of Middle American poseurs who wanted to be seen as superior intellects because they were fans of the ""smart"" Jewish comic from New York: ""Har har har- Woody Allen just referenced the Oedipus Complex in his joke. I understand that reference, so I must be smart too! Har har, do_you_get it?"". This is the first Woody Allen movie I've ever seen, and I think it will be the last.

275473,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6301963911,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","""Annie Hall"" is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time. The film not only holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#31), as well as The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#4). The film took home 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director; The film is also without a doubt one of the best romantic-comedies ever made. It really nails that awkwardness of romance. I think few of us are like the neurotic Woody Allen and I don't so much mean the way the characters act, but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but can't really get a grip on love. He's been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic, which turns people off. Then his friend Rob (Tony Roberts) introduces him to Annie Hall (the wonderful Diane Keaton). Annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as Alvy, but the two click and begin a relationship that (to say the least) has it's share of ups and downs. Now, not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything true-to-life but this film is also absolutely hilarious. When I see a movie on AFI's Top 100 Comedies, I tend to shy away from the films on that list. Not because they're not good, it's just that they don't really pick by what's the funniest film ever. Example, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was funnier than their number 1 pick Some Like It Hot. But anyway, Annie Hall actually is very funny. The dialogue is quick-witted, some the scenes have become classics (Allen sneezing on the cocaine). In an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres, it's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is. This is a great film, a great romantic-comedy, a Woody Allen masterpiece.GRADE: A",5,"Very Funny, A Great Movie",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1842,"['Annie', 'Hall', 'one', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'time', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'place', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'Top', '100', '31', 'as', 'well', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'Top', '100', 'Comedies', '4', 'film', 'took', 'home', '4', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'film', 'also', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'romantic-comedies', 'ever', 'made', 'really', 'awkwardness', 'romance', 'think', 'few', 'are', 'neurotic', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'way', 'characters', 'act', 'way', 'think', 'stuff', 'totally', 'realistic', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Alvy', 'Singer', 'comeddian', 'who', 'always', 'park', 'when', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'grip', 'love', 'been', 'two', 'marriages', 'little', 'bit', 'neurotic', 'people', 'off', 'Then', 'friend', 'Rob', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'wonderful', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Annie', 'little', 'bit', 'ditzy', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'smart', 'Alvy', 'two', 'click', 'begin', 'relationship', 'say', 'least', 'share', 'ups', 'downs', 'Now', 'not', 'only', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'everything', 'true-to-life', 'film', 'also', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'When', 'see', 'movie', 'AFI', 'Top', '100', 'Comedies', 'tend', 'shy', 'away', 'films', 'list', 'Not', ""'re"", 'not', 'good', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'pick', 'what', 'funniest', 'film', 'ever', 'Example', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'was', 'funnier', 'number', '1', 'pick', 'Hot', 'anyway', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'actually', 'very', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'quick-witted', 'scenes', 'have', 'become', 'classics', 'Allen', 'sneezing', 'cocaine', 'era', 'where', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'run', 'rampant', 'movie', 'theatres', 'nice', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'films', 'really', 'made', 'genre', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'romantic-comedy', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'masterpiece.GRADE']",N/A

Allen's whining is the most supremely self-defeating comedian's gimmick since Jerry Lewis' quintessential fingernails-on-a-blackboard voice!!(you know a film is in trouble when it comes billed as a comedy and the most amusing thing in it is the misspelling of Christopher Walken's name (""Wlaken"") in the credits!!)i single this particular film out cheifly because it would become his signature piece. but that makes sense, doesn't it? if it's the foremost example of Allen's work, surely that makes it the worst of all.and i might as well admit it: i also have some hostility based on the fact that ANNIE HALL, by winning Best Picture, finds itself at the nexus of one of the all-time great miscarrages of Oscar justice. if STAR WARS had to lose, couldn't it at least lose to the sort of pretentious, artsy-fartsy ""prestige"" film that usually wins?come to think of it, it's just as much of a tragedy that comedy films so seldom win. so why, when that Blue Moon rolled around, did it have to go to a ""comedy"" that's only slightly funnier than Charles Manson's murder spree? with or without STAR WARS in the equation, this is comparable to a Nobel Peace Prize for whoever invented the lobotomy.[NOTE: it's been a couple months since i wrote that, and at the time i was sure it was my own witticism. i've since discovered, however, that the inventor of the lobotomy, one Gottleib Burkhardt, did indeed receive a Nobel. and yup, that's what it was for.what can i say? you can't make this stuff up, even when you try.]",1,THE HUMOR OF WOODY ALLEN...and other abstract notions.,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,2306,"['try', 'i', 'might', 'i', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'convert', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fan', 'God', 'i', 'have', 'tried', 'chiefly', 'i', 'keep', 'hearing', 'inexplicably', 'classified', 'masters', 'genuine', 'comedy', 'whom', 'i', 'just', 'living', 'daylights', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker', 'end', 'day', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'writing', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'sophistication', 'reknown', 'alas', 'more', 'make', 'pleasant', 'characters', 'have', 'innate', 'likability', 'Third', 'Reich', 'films', 'ultimately', 'have', 'entertainment', 'value', 'math', 'test', 'talent', 'say', 'nothing', 'charm', 'Allen', 'might', 'have', 'completely', 'neutralized', 'basic', 'flaw', 'formula', 'neurotics', 'might', 'be', 'funny', 'bit', 'WHINERS', 'never', 'are', 'Allen', 'whining', 'most', 'supremely', 'self-defeating', 'comedian', 'gimmick', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'quintessential', 'fingernails-on-a-blackboard', 'voice', 'know', 'film', 'trouble', 'when', 'billed', 'comedy', 'most', 'amusing', 'thing', 'misspelling', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'name', 'Wlaken', 'credits', 'i', 'single', 'particular', 'film', 'cheifly', 'would', 'become', 'signature', 'piece', 'sense', ""n't"", 'foremost', 'example', 'Allen', 'work', 'surely', 'worst', 'all.and', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'i', 'also', 'have', 'hostility', 'based', 'fact', 'ANNIE', 'HALL', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nexus', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'miscarrages', 'Oscar', 'justice', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'had', 'lose', 'could', ""n't"", 'least', 'lose', 'sort', 'pretentious', 'artsy-fartsy', 'prestige', 'film', 'usually', 'come', 'think', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'films', 'so', 'seldom', 'win', 'so', 'why', 'when', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'rolled', 'around', 'did', 'have', 'go', 'comedy', 'only', 'slightly', 'funnier', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'murder', 'spree', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'equation', 'comparable', 'Nobel', 'Peace', 'Prize', 'invented', 'lobotomy', '[', 'NOTE', 'been', 'couple', 'months', 'i', 'wrote', 'time', 'i', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'own', 'witticism', 'i', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'however', 'inventor', 'lobotomy', 'one', 'Gottleib', 'Burkhardt', 'did', 'indeed', 'receive', 'Nobel', 'yup', 'what', 'was', 'for.what', 'can', 'i', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'stuff', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'try', ']']",N/A

A self-conscious neurotic quippy self-flagellating Jewish comedian meets a juicy self-conscious WASP, wooing her, rejecting her and after being rejected himself longing for a life that could have been. There is always an aura of sadness about Allen's films - a sadness of masculinity longed for and never realized, of self-contempt burning in someone who knows he can't ever escape the intellectual mindtrap that epitomizes the 'New Yorker' crowd. While Allen appears to despise the greed, snobbery and pretentiousness of this crowd, he always seems paralyzed and unable to find his way out of the mousetrap.Annie Hall is a genuinely funny and profound film. Alvyn knows the New Yorker crowd lacks something that would fulfill his longing. He knows that 'Annie' represents  his one chance to escape the straightjacket of empty intellectual poseurism.  The self-revelatory autobiographical element are bittersweet as the viewer becomes all too aware that Alvyn fails the challenge of his life. the very character trait that makes him funny makes him incapable of being able to hold, endure and accept Annie for who she is . The film is, for me, a lesson showing how not to be a man.  A demonstration of the consequences of not being able to love fully, of being unable to disappear into surrender.Both Keaton and Allen do a fantastic acting job basically playing themselves.

275479,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,6301963911,Kenji Fujishima,"[1, 1]","ANNIE HALL is often considered Woody Allen's masterpiece. Certainly, it is one of his most personal and touching films, a seriocomic meditation on...well, love, basically. Love and the search for relationships. Alvy Singer, the character Allen plays in this film, is always on the lookout for a relationship, but something always seems to get in the way of true happiness with a woman for him---and (I hope I'm not spoiling anything for anyone by saying this), his central relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) in this film is no exception.Let me say right off that I thought this film was often fun to watch. Dialogue of such sharp comic wit and intelligence as Allen writes here is always something to be treasured (although sometimes he can be a bit too witty and referential for his own good, leaving some of his audience in the dark), the performances are equally spot-on (Allen's especially), and the filmmaking style is fascinating and sometimes exhilarating. This is hardly your usual romantic comedy with a linear plot. Allen plays with the time order of events (you immediately find out about Alvy and Annie's breakup at the beginning), throws in surreal flashbacks to his childhood, and even has his character speak directly to the camera at certain points. But never does any of it seem to be film trickery for its own sake; Allen seems to use this style more searchingly. He himself seems to be trying to find out the reasons why love can hurt so much.ANNIE HALL is not a perfect film. Maybe it would have been better if Alvy Singer's story had been told in a slightly more linear style; the film seems a bit more of a jumbled mess in its final form, and its seeming lack of a plot structure at times distracted me (since I couldn't quite figure out the reason for it). And perhaps Allen could have developed Annie Hall's character a little more than he did; as brilliantly as Diane Keaton played her (and she won an Oscar for this performance, as did the film itself), she always remained more a set of personality quirks and attitudes than an actual flesh-and-blood character. (But then, perhaps that's the whole point; maybe that's the way Alvy sees her, and maybe that's partly why he, in the end, loses her).Still, ANNIE HALL is overall a good film, one that is a lot more mature and perceptive about love and relationships than a lot of the romantic comedies I've seen in recent times (as entertaining as some of them may be). For its laughs as well as its depth, it is worth seeing, and maybe even worth reflecting after the humor of Woody Allen's neuroses has worn off and the bittersweet poignancy of its ending remains.

There's the New Yorker who never learns to drive, the mid-westerner who orders a pastrami sandwich on white bread with mayonnaise (which seems almost grotesque to a New Yorker like me), the pretentious movie critic, the neuroses of modern romances, and the differences between the New York and Los Angeles way of life.The film runs along at such a fast pace that there is almost no time at all between funny moments.  And, to make it even better, there are some wonderful film techniques.

Then there are movies that delve into a different area - into the ups and downs of a real life relationship. Annie Hall is subtle in its investigations, and you have to close up the laptop, put away the distractions, and really allow yourself to get swept away by this one to catch the numerous little things that are so true to life.Allen and Keaton are both, in many ways, playing themselves. Allen adores New York, is a bit paranoid and self-conscious, and he falls for the sweetness of Keaton, who in her own way is just as lost. Their starting moments are as shy and nervous as many of us have encountered a few times in life. The subtitles are great, helping show the oh-so-common disconnect between the things we say and what we're really thinking.No relationship goes smooth. They have the first kiss, the walks along the water, the break-ups, the fear of spiders, the meeting of the families. They run into racist family members, tough job situations, and along the way both of them grow and change. This isn't a stagnant relationship. The way they change is part of the joy here. We get to see them mature and broaden their horizons, sometimes with good results, sometimes with a step back.My boyfriend's a born-and-bred New Yorker and he cringed when Keaton ordered the pastrami on white with mayo. There are just so many little touches like that, things that resonate with people who have lived and loved New York. There are brilliant angles on the LA culture - from Allen's point of view of course - including Jeff Goldblum sighing into the phone that he's ""forgotten his mantra"". What tragedy!I do have to comment that is just staggering to me that this movie all about relationships - and who is supposedly featuring Annie Hall as the main character - only ONCE has two women talk directly to each other. And that's for about 2 seconds, when Annie's family is sharing the screen with Allen's family. Annie's mom asks Allen's mom what they do for the holidays and Allen's mom replies, ""we fast"". That's it!! The entire movie, and that's the only moment where two women talk with each other. Everything else is about Allen talking to various people around him. It goes to show how fully we as an audience have come to expect that women are the supporting cast to the men.Still, a lot of great insights here, and a love story not only to Annie, but also to New York City.",5,A  Love Story to New York City,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,2466,"['are', 'movies', 'known', 'intense', 'war', 'scenes', 'eardrum-shattering', 'action', 'Then', 'are', 'movies', 'delve', 'different', 'area', 'ups', 'downs', 'real', 'life', 'relationship', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'subtle', 'investigations', 'have', 'close', 'up', 'laptop', 'put', 'away', 'distractions', 'really', 'allow', 'get', 'swept', 'away', 'one', 'catch', 'numerous', 'little', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'true', 'life.Allen', 'Keaton', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'playing', 'Allen', 'New', 'York', 'bit', 'paranoid', 'self-conscious', 'sweetness', 'Keaton', 'who', 'own', 'way', 'just', 'lost', 'starting', 'moments', 'are', 'shy', 'nervous', 'many', 'have', 'encountered', 'few', 'times', 'life', 'subtitles', 'are', 'great', 'helping', 'show', 'oh-so-common', 'disconnect', 'things', 'say', 'what', ""'re"", 'really', 'thinking.No', 'relationship', 'smooth', 'have', 'first', 'kiss', 'walks', 'water', 'break-ups', 'fear', 'spiders', 'meeting', 'families', 'run', 'racist', 'family', 'members', 'tough', 'job', 'situations', 'way', 'grow', 'change', ""n't"", 'stagnant', 'relationship', 'way', 'change', 'part', 'joy', 'here', 'get', 'see', 'mature', 'broaden', 'horizons', 'sometimes', 'good', 'results', 'sometimes', 'step', 'back.My', 'boyfriend', 'born-and-bred', 'New', 'Yorker', 'cringed', 'when', 'Keaton', 'ordered', 'pastrami', 'white', 'mayo', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'little', 'touches', 'things', 'resonate', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'loved', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'brilliant', 'angles', 'LA', 'culture', 'Allen', 'point', 'view', 'course', 'including', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'sighing', 'phone', 'forgotten', 'mantra', 'What', 'tragedy', 'do', 'have', 'comment', 'just', 'staggering', 'movie', 'relationships', 'who', 'supposedly', 'featuring', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'main', 'character', 'only', 'ONCE', 'two', 'women', 'talk', 'directly', 'other', 'about', '2', 'seconds', 'when', 'Annie', 'family', 'sharing', 'screen', 'Allen', 'family', 'Annie', 'mom', 'Allen', 'mom', 'what', 'do', 'holidays', 'Allen', 'mom', 'replies', 'fast', 'entire', 'movie', 'only', 'moment', 'where', 'two', 'women', 'talk', 'other', 'Everything', 'else', 'Allen', 'talking', 'various', 'people', 'show', 'how', 'fully', 'audience', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'women', 'are', 'supporting', 'cast', 'men.Still', 'lot', 'great', 'insights', 'here', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'Annie', 'also', 'New', 'York', 'City']",N/A

It is so realistic of what happens with romances.Before seeing this movie, I had not seen many of Woody Allen's films.  Actually, this one was my first.  It has since become my favorite.  I love how Allen combines humor and drama in this movie.Diane Keaton gives a *wonderful* performance in this movie as Annie Hall.  She is both strong and weak at the same time.  When she wants to do something, she does it.  Alvy Singer (Allen) basically goes along for the ride and is quite the opposite of her, which is what I think made these two the perfect match for one another.As I watched the movie, I could also see that there was this 'click' with Keaton and Allen.  They work so well together on-screen.  I saw that same click when I saw &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot; and &quot;Manhattan.&quot;And let's not forget the fasion trend that Annie Hall created!One little thing I will advise you on is this: if you are not a Woody Allen fan, you may not enjoy the movie.

Nearly a self-portrait of his affair with the luminous Diane Keaton, Allen paints a love affair in his beloved New York City, full of all the neurosis, eccentricities and oddball humor associated with Woody Allen.Although New York is showcased, Los Angeles takes a second seat as the self indulgent, narcissistic counterpart. There are too many hilarious scenes to mention, other than they are non-stop and all hit pay dirt. This is also one of Allen's most inventive films, using split frame scenes for discussions between opposed families, inter-spliced time-gags (invisible characters visiting their past), cartoons representing the main characters and Allen narrating most of the film; sometimes directly into the audience's face.It should also be noted that many stars got a big start from this film. Carole Kane is featured as one of Alvy's good-hearted girlfriends, along with a post-hippie Shelley Duvall. Diane Keaton's brother is played by a typically creepy Christopher Walken and her mother by the noble Colleen Dewhurst. Paul Simon, Truman Capote, Beverly DeAngelo and Dick Cavett also make guest appearances. Watch for the very young Sigourney Weaver as Alvy's date outside of a theater.Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress, this film is timeless.

This is Allen at his best: We get flawless, meaningful performances from a great cast and the plot moves along at a very good pace. The editing was wonderful. Although Woody Allen had to cut much from the original version of this film, he cut well and we get a motion picture with practically nothing left to remove. What's more, there's so much comedy in this film it stands out as one of the best comedies I've ever seen. The cinematography is very well done and the choreography works best in crowd scenes and the scenes on the streets of Manhattan.When the action starts, we meet twice divorced Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) who pals around with his friend Rob (Tony Roberts). Alvy comes from a dysfunctional family that literally lived under the roller coaster at Coney Island; and he hasn't stopped shaking and being neurotic since his childhood. One day Alvy, Rob and a couple of women gather to play indoor tennis--and Alvy meets Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). It isn't long, either, before Alvy and Annie strike up a pretty hot romance despite a few awkward moments in their very first conversations.As time passes, Alvy and Annie have a lot of experiences--some good, some bad; but they stay together through it. Alvy tries to get Annie to ""broaden her horizons"" with books that he buys for her and his encouragement for her to take continuing education courses at New York University. Annie and Alvy also enjoy a pretty good romantic life.But things change over time. Annie grows but Alvy essentially stays the same. Annie wants to move to Los Angeles where she thinks she can record music along with Tony Lacey (Paul Simon); but Alvy wants to stay in New York. Alvy can't stand California in general and he especially hates Los Angeles.The plot can go anywhere from here. Annie also sings and dabbles in photography--will this affect their relationship? Will Alvy move out to California to continue his relationship with Annie? What about Tony Lacey--he seems to be attracted to Annie. Will Tony come between Alvy and Annie? Watch and find out!I must say that Woody Allen uses some pretty incredible techniques to show how people can see others. At one point, Alvy images that he appears to be a Hasidic Jew in the eyes of the anti-Semitic ""Grammy Hall"" (Helen Ludlam). At another point, Allen has Alvy, Annie and Rob looking on at a party given many years prior for a family member back in Brooklyn; and it's fascinating to see the characters in the present react to the party so many years prior.Annie Hall will always be a timeless love story with so much comedy you'll practically roll over on the floor with laughter. Obviously, this film is a ""must-have"" for fans of the actors in this film; and Woody Allen fans could never have a complete collection of his work unless they have this film.

However, time can do funny things...I first saw this picture a few years later, with my first real girlfriend (hi, Lisa!) on the revival circuit. I found it witty and intelligent, as I have with most of Woody Allen's films. I have to say that, to my 16-year-old mind, it still didn't make a huge impression. Twenty years and a failed marriage later, however, I think I can honestly say that I now get it.Annie Hall is, to me, Woody Allen's greatest triumph as a filmmaker and a storyteller. It's a bittersweet, often hilarious recounting of a relationship from its start to its inevitable end. We see Allen at his most honest, at times brutal examination of himself and his destructive approach to relationships as he plays Alvy Singer, a funny, neurotic comedian (not a great stretch for Woody, granted). All the angst, the neuroses, and manic phobias that at first seem so idiosyncratic and charming, eventually become tiring and sad. Here is a man who is so attached to his psychoses that he would be an empty shell without them, and we see the painful fact of this in his reflections of previous relationships and marriages throughout the course of his adult life. Ultimately, this is a character so galvanized by his fears and phobias that he is simply incapable of managing a complex adult relationship, one free of paranoia and anxiety and this is his tragic downfall. In short, he is a small child trapped in the body of a small man.This is not, however, one of Allen's Bergmanesque forays into introspection. The knee-slapping hilarity of many of the scenes help draw us into his world and the relationship he has with Annie (Diane Keaton, marvelous as always), his friends, his family, and the world around him. A particular favorite is when, on their first meeting, Alvy and Annie exchange basic getting-to-know-you small talk, and their hidden meanings and anxieties are shown to us in subtitles. Other scenes involving a movie-line blowhard, a lost mantra, and Annie's decidedly white-bread family are the stuff of legend, and they never fail to bring a smile to my face.Though this film is nearing thirty-years old, it shows no sign of aging. The themes are familiar and universal; who hasn't fallen desperately in love, only to feel the painful tentacles of fear come creeping in the moment they've opened their heart for all the world to see? This film will never lose its place in my heart as one of the best films I've ever seen.",5,Because we need the eggs,1088726400,"07 2, 2004",2004,2597,"['Ok', 'let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'way', 'when', 'was', '12', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'beat', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Award', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'kid', 'However', 'time', 'can', 'do', 'funny', 'things', 'first', 'saw', 'picture', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'first', 'real', 'girlfriend', 'hi', 'Lisa', 'revival', 'circuit', 'found', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'have', 'most', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'have', 'say', '16-year-old', 'mind', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'huge', 'impression', 'Twenty', 'years', 'failed', 'marriage', 'later', 'however', 'think', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'now', 'get', 'it.Annie', 'Hall', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'filmmaker', 'storyteller', 'bittersweet', 'often', 'hilarious', 'recounting', 'relationship', 'start', 'inevitable', 'end', 'see', 'Allen', 'most', 'honest', 'times', 'brutal', 'examination', 'destructive', 'approach', 'relationships', 'Alvy', 'Singer', 'funny', 'neurotic', 'comedian', 'not', 'great', 'stretch', 'Woody', 'granted', 'angst', 'neuroses', 'manic', 'phobias', 'first', 'seem', 'so', 'idiosyncratic', 'charming', 'eventually', 'become', 'tiring', 'sad', 'Here', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'attached', 'psychoses', 'would', 'be', 'empty', 'shell', 'see', 'painful', 'fact', 'reflections', 'previous', 'relationships', 'marriages', 'course', 'adult', 'life', 'Ultimately', 'character', 'so', 'galvanized', 'fears', 'phobias', 'simply', 'incapable', 'managing', 'complex', 'adult', 'relationship', 'one', 'free', 'paranoia', 'anxiety', 'tragic', 'downfall', 'short', 'small', 'child', 'trapped', 'body', 'small', 'man.This', 'not', 'however', 'one', 'Allen', 'Bergmanesque', 'introspection', 'knee-slapping', 'hilarity', 'many', 'scenes', 'help', 'draw', 'world', 'relationship', 'Annie', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'marvelous', 'always', 'friends', 'family', 'world', 'particular', 'favorite', 'when', 'first', 'meeting', 'Alvy', 'Annie', 'exchange', 'basic', 'getting-to-know-you', 'small', 'talk', 'hidden', 'meanings', 'anxieties', 'are', 'shown', 'subtitles', 'Other', 'scenes', 'involving', 'movie-line', 'blowhard', 'lost', 'mantra', 'Annie', 'decidedly', 'white-bread', 'family', 'are', 'stuff', 'legend', 'never', 'fail', 'bring', 'smile', 'face.Though', 'film', 'nearing', 'thirty-years', 'old', 'sign', 'aging', 'themes', 'are', 'familiar', 'universal', 'who', ""n't"", 'fallen', 'desperately', 'love', 'only', 'feel', 'painful', 'tentacles', 'fear', 'come', 'creeping', 'moment', ""'ve"", 'opened', 'heart', 'world', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'lose', 'place', 'heart', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

Oleson,"[3, 3]","To put it bluntly, this is my favorite Woody Allen film as well as my favorite comedy of all time so I would have a hard time being terribly objective as I believe the film holds up well today. By this stage of Allen's career he had become more sophisticated in his comedy and less reliant of the slapstick, as good as it was, of his earlier films. Diane Keaton returns as a romantic foil for Allen once again. Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comedy writer and two time loser at marriage. His relationship with Keaton's waspish Annie allows Allen to make this film personal and almost autobiographical in nature.Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are great together. Chasing lobsters and spiders. Keaton also started a whole new trend in women's clothing that lasted years. This great film has lost little even if the mores of the times are different. Allen is at the top of his game as a director and actor and Diane Keaton shows what a great actress she is...as well as a pretty good singer. Keep your eyes peeled for small roles for Christopher Walken, Shelley Duvall, Sigourney Weaver, Truman Capote and Jeff Goldblum.The Blu ray version, while a step up from the DVD isn't going to wow the viewer like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but it is very good and has very little video noise.

In his fascinating book on film editing, ""When the Shooting Stops ... the Cutting Begins,"" Rosenbloom explained how Annie Hall started out as a collection of loosely related scenes that was more a personal psychological exploration by Allen than a love story. Only after months of re-edits and some re-shooting did the story emerge as movie audiences saw it. Annie Hall is a flight of fancy, loosely based on the real-life affair between Allen and Keaton (Hall is Keaton's real name). Sometimes sweet and affectionate, sometimes acidly satirical, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, it was chosen Best Picture in a year that included such crowd-pleasing blockbusters as Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

Mr. Allen plays Alvy Singer who is a standup comic and the most neurotic person ever put on film.

The movie details his relationship with Diane Keaton's title character.  The film acts as a catharsis for Mr. Allen and we, the audience, are like his psychiatrist with him on the couch.  The film contains classic Allenesque lines about life, death, California and other subjects and it doesn't appear that Mr. Allen is really acting.  He's more or less playing himself.

The script of a self-indulgent, Brooklyn, Bergman wanna-be massaging his Liberalism to advantage, is pseudo-intellectual air.  Woody's humor, the Jewish Complaint, is stale now.  We thought it was so funny back in the 60's and 70's.  We gave this schlemiel, a Jewish version of Waspy, Bob Hope, a free pass for thirty years.  After all the lint has been flicked from the navel, what we have is a dopey looking ethnic with delusions about the prom queen.  But then again - don't we all and there's the appeal.In 1977, Allen pasted some of the quirky techniques of European directors such as Bergman, Godard, or Fellini, and grafted an American style romance of the 1930's variety. There's an element of screwball such as Clark Gable's It Happened One Night or Cary Grant's, Front Page. Anyhow, mix in a little mild counterculture style, dope smoking, coke sniffing, and bed jumping and you get a pastiche of Post-Vietnam Modernism. Reflecting the new feminism: there's no questioning Annie's morals.  She's a single woman that sleeps with her boyfriends.  It's a given, but back in the Eisenhower years, oh, the angst, hide the children!  Reliable birth control had triumphed.Allen is the first nerd to make it big in the Post-Nam years.

275522,A16QODENBJVUI1,6301963911,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","ANNIE HALL represents a turning point in Woody Allen's career.  Before it, he was primarily known as the crafter of a series of very, very funny films.  But he was not truly considered a serious filmmaker.  After ANNIE HALL, Allen has been known more as a serious filmmaker, but not as funny as he was earlier in his career.  This film belongs in both worlds, as funny as his earlier films, and as serious as any of his later.  He was able to strike a perfect balance here that he was never able to strike again.  Many I know wish he would shoot for films as funny as SLEEPER or LOVE AND DEATH.  I would prefer the balance he struck in this, his masterpiece.Although this is a serious film at heart, it is also a comic masterpiece.  Woody pulls out every kind of joke, whether verbal, situational, slapstick, or absurd, and a few forms he invented himself.  The structure of the entire film is something unique to Woody.  At points he addresses the audience directly.  At other times, he seems to have the powers of a deity to manipulate every aspect of a scene.  He can transport himself back in time to query former classmates about what they are doing as adults.  He can summon up Marshall McLuhan to have him tell someone else that he doesn't understand his theories.  At the same time, he seamlessly injects the kind of self-deprecating humor that was the mainstay of both his stand up routines and earlier movies.  It is one of the most virtuosic comedy films ever made.The film made Diane Keaton a star.  She was not unknown when the film was made.  She had, after all, played an important role in THE GODFATHER films.  She had appeared in two previous Woody Allen films, and had become famous as the person in HAIR who would not remove her clothes.  But ANNIE HALL was the making of her.  She created a great character, and the ""Annie Hall"" look had considerable influence on fashion for some time after the film was released, and anyone hearing ""la-dee-dah"" knows exactly where it came from.One thing that isn't sufficiently noted is the incredible eye for talent that Woody Allen's casting directors have displayed over the years.  The number of major stars to appear in Woody Allen films very early in their careers is eye popping.  This one is not exception.  Christopher Walken has a small but memorable role as Annie's insane brother, Beverly D'Angelo has a small role as an actress, and Woody's tall, attractive date at the end of the film when running into Annie on the sidewalk is none other than Sigourney Weaver.",5,Still one of the great comedies of recent decades,1046822400,"03 5, 2003",2003,2531,"['ANNIE', 'HALL', 'turning', 'point', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'career', 'was', 'primarily', 'known', 'crafter', 'series', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'films', 'was', 'not', 'truly', 'considered', 'serious', 'filmmaker', 'ANNIE', 'HALL', 'Allen', 'been', 'known', 'more', 'serious', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'was', 'earlier', 'career', 'film', 'worlds', 'as', 'funny', 'earlier', 'films', 'as', 'serious', 'later', 'was', 'able', 'strike', 'perfect', 'balance', 'here', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'strike', 'again', 'Many', 'know', 'wish', 'would', 'shoot', 'films', 'as', 'funny', 'SLEEPER', 'LOVE', 'AND', 'DEATH', 'would', 'prefer', 'balance', 'struck', 'masterpiece.Although', 'serious', 'film', 'heart', 'also', 'comic', 'masterpiece', 'Woody', 'out', 'kind', 'joke', 'verbal', 'situational', 'slapstick', 'absurd', 'few', 'forms', 'invented', 'structure', 'entire', 'film', 'something', 'unique', 'Woody', 'points', 'audience', 'directly', 'other', 'times', 'have', 'powers', 'deity', 'manipulate', 'aspect', 'scene', 'can', 'transport', 'back', 'time', 'query', 'former', 'classmates', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'adults', 'can', 'summon', 'up', 'Marshall', 'McLuhan', 'have', 'tell', 'someone', 'else', ""n't"", 'understand', 'theories', 'same', 'time', 'seamlessly', 'kind', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'was', 'mainstay', 'stand', 'up', 'routines', 'earlier', 'movies', 'one', 'most', 'virtuosic', 'comedy', 'films', 'ever', 'made.The', 'film', 'made', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'star', 'was', 'not', 'unknown', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'had', 'played', 'important', 'role', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'films', 'had', 'appeared', 'two', 'previous', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'had', 'become', 'famous', 'person', 'HAIR', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'remove', 'clothes', 'ANNIE', 'HALL', 'was', 'making', 'created', 'great', 'character', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'look', 'had', 'considerable', 'influence', 'fashion', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'anyone', 'hearing', 'la-dee-dah', 'exactly', 'where', 'came', 'from.One', 'thing', ""n't"", 'sufficiently', 'noted', 'incredible', 'eye', 'talent', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'casting', 'directors', 'have', 'displayed', 'years', 'number', 'major', 'stars', 'appear', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'very', 'early', 'careers', 'eye', 'popping', 'one', 'not', 'exception', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'small', 'memorable', 'role', 'Annie', 'insane', 'brother', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'small', 'role', 'actress', 'Woody', 'tall', 'attractive', 'date', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'running', 'Annie', 'sidewalk', 'none', 'other', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver']",N/A
275523,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6301963911,Robert Morris,"[5, 7]","This film and Hannah and Her Sisters are my two favorites among Allen's many films. Of course there are brilliant scenes in the others but, in my opinion, they lack the seamless integration of acting, dialog, and narrative which Annie and Hannah possess. In any event, I enjoy seeing them more each time, in part because I see something I missed before. Alvy Singer (Allen) unexpectedly becomes involved with Annie Hall (Keaton). At least initially, neither he nor we know quite what to make of her. Over time, for various reasons, their relationship weakens. Each has needs the other really cannot fully satisfy. Both seem unable to enjoy themselves (hence their relentless introspection, self-doubts, insecurities, and therapy sessions) and probably for that reason, they have a very difficult time enjoying anyone else. For them, happiness is only temporary and always conditional. The supporting cast is among the strongest in Allen's films thus far. I especially enjoy the performances by Tony Roberts (Rob), Carol Kane (Allison), Christopher Walken (Duane Hall) and Colleen Dewhurst (Mom Hall). One of the most memorable scenes involves Marshall McLuhan (as himself) who corrects a pseudo-intellectual in the movie line. Paul Simon (Tony Lacey) and Sigourney Weaver (as Alvy's date) also make brief appearances. Annie Hall received an Academy Award as best film and Allen received two (for directing and co-writing best original screenplay with Marshall Brickman); Diane Keaton also received an Academy Award as best actress. The film is still refreshing and entertaining after more than 25 years. One other highly subjective opinion: unlike so many (perhaps even most) of Allen's other films, Annie Hall has many moments of tenderness and even poignancy amidst the always clever conversations. Allen has raised neurosis to new levels of self-revelation. To his credit, he never allows this film to dwell there as a permanent residence.

275531,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,6301963911,Scott Schiefelbein,"[8, 11]","In 1977, Woody Allen abandoned slapstick comedy for something greater and more personal. He gave us ""Annie Hall,"" arguably the most quotable comedy of all time. It won four Oscars: Best Actress for Diane Keaton, Best Director for Allen, Best Picture for Charles Joffe, and Best Screenplay for Allen and Marshall Brickman.If you've ever roared at a Larry David series (and considering David's work on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""Seinfeld,"" you probably have), you owe a tip of your hat to the Woodster.For the film's 35th anniversary, ""Annie Hall"" has been re-released on Blu-ray. Allen plays Alvy Singer, a twice-divorced stand-up comedian who is ever so slightly Jewish and rather fond of New York. Scratch that: this movie is entirely about Alvy's Jewishness and his adoration of all things New York, including the grime and crime. A stand-in for Allen, the character is self-deprecating and funny. He sums up his paradoxical life with the Groucho Marx line, ""I'd never want to belong to a club that would have me as a member.""That contradiction drives Alvy through his one-year relationship with Annie (Keaton), a nave WASP from Wisconsin trying to make it in the Big Apple. The movie opens with Alvy lamenting his lost love, and then meanders back through their time together to track how the romance died. Things start out fine; Annie picks Alvy up after a tennis match (where we get the famous ""Lah-de-dah"" line) and for a short time they are blissfully happy. But all too soon Alvy starts screwing up his own happiness, buying Annie books on death and insisting she go to therapy, which he pays for, setting a high bar for obnoxious, controlling boyfriends everywhere. After all, Alvy's been in therapy for 15 years and look how well adjusted he is.Things really come to a boil after Alvy encourages Annie to sing, which is a talent completely outside of Alvy's control. This leads to Annie's biggest betrayal. She listens to a hotshot music executive (Paul Simon, in one of a gazillion cameos with famous and soon-to-be-famous folks, including Christopher Walken, Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Goldblum, and Truman Capote) and heads to California, where Alvy is as out-of-place as pickled herring in Jello.""Annie Hall"" proves Allen's creative genius. Allen perpetually breaks the fourth wall to address the audience. He uses animation (Snow White!), double-exposure (the famous scene where Annie's ""ghost"" leaves her body during sex), subtitles (to show the characters' unspoken thoughts), and other clever cinematic devices to great effect. ""Annie Hall"" also clicks as a comedy even though it was originally a murder mystery.And yet, unless you're a die-hard Woody Allen fan, this is not a must-own release. Why? Well, for one, the Blu-ray upgrade does absolutely nothing for this movie. It still looks grainy and dated, and there is virtually no music to benefit from the improved technology. The ""Annie Hall"" Blu-ray also contains one pathetic extra: the original theatrical trailer. To borrow another of the movie's famous lines: ""A relationship, I think, is like a shark. It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.""

This film captures the best of both worlds. As a result, I think it is Woody Allen's finest.From the off, the jokes are teriffic: the movie opens with a typically emotionally fraught Allen addressing the camera direct: 'There's this joke, two Jewish women at a Catskill mountain resort having dinner - one says 'the food here's terrible,' the other says, 'yeah, and such small portions' - and that sums up my view on life'. Annie Hall is Woody Allen's finest diagnosis on love and life. Annie is an endearing character in her men's shirts and ties, the grass smoking temptress who unwittingly draws the intellectually fraught Alvie Singer (Allen )into her seemingly innocent web - 'What, did you live in a Norman Rockwell painting or something?'. The couple poke fun at New York Intellectuals: 'Samuel Beckett - he just doesn't hit me at a gut level' - 'I'd like to hit him at a gut level'. And the transient curve of modern sexual relationships.

The few stand-up scenes are great, because ten years earlier Woody Allen was a stand-up comedian and he makes it seem so natural.""I...interestingly had, uh, dated...a woman in the Eisenhower Administration...briefly...and, uh, it was ironic to me 'cause, uh ... tsch ...

Alvy gets annoyed and introduces the man to Marshall McLuhan who promptly tells the man ""you know nothing of my work...."".In perhaps the most famous scene in the film Alvy and Annie go back to her apartment and standing on the balcony they talk awkardly. We hear them talk but see what they are think in subtitles:Alvy: Photography's interesting, 'cause, you know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have not emereged yet.

So few films have Maximum Initial Impact, in that they fail to deliver maximum enjoyment on one's first viewing.While Annie Hall certainly bears considerable repeated viewing, it is simply stunning first time through. Apart from the brilliant dialogue and character depth, it contains so many all-too-human touches. I loved the part on the first date when he asks Annie if he can kiss her before they start, just to take away the tension of will-they won't-they kiss, so that they may more easily relax and enjoy their first time out.As a fairly linear romantic comedy, it is unsurpassed, yet there are also many surrealistic elements which give it a quality that one usually associates with European movies.Woody Allen shoehorned so many brilliant and original ideas into Annie Hall that it is staggering to recall that they were all from the same movie. Everything from the Jew-hating grandmother to the kids in his class telling the camera what they ended up as in adult life, serve to keep you off balance, so that you never slide into a ""well I can see what's coming up next"" state of complacency.Allen is a master when it comes to relationships and human failings (and strengths) and his hilarious handling of sexual interactions - ""I'm just trying to work some circulation back into my jaw"" - makes this one of those rare movies in which virtually everybody can find something to make you squirm and say, ""Oh man, he's right"".Annie Hall is classy, it's beautiful, it is full of love, wisdom and compassion, and above all it is utterly hilarious.

It is not only riotously funny, but also compellingly human, with a warmth, genuineness and sincerity not so easily detected in some of the director's later films.It is common to read Woody Allen's films in self-referential terms, the legitimacy of which he himself denies. His films, however, virtually cry out for such an interpretation, concerned as they are with the complex and often blurred interrelations of life and art, reality and fantasy (as here, and also, most notably, Deconstructing Harry, almost twenty years later). Plus Woody makes it so tempting to view his main characters not as &quot;Alvie Singer&quot; (his name in this picture), but as &quot;Woody Allen&quot;. Virtually all his characters are neurotic writers or comedians with problem love-lives - in other words, the person who emerges from Woody Allen's pictures is the real-life Woody Allen. In Annie Hall, Woody reflects on past relationships, in particular his relationship with the girl of the title (played by Diane Keaton).

""Annie Hall"" in my opinion is the worst Woody Allen's movie out of all those I've seen so far. Worse even than ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" and ""Cassandra's Dream."" It was impossible for me to connect with the story, I couldn't understand the relationship between Allen's character and Annie, the movie itself was directed in a very strange way. I don't know, I didn't really enjoy it, but I was able to finish watching it and for that I gave it 2 stars.",2,What was that about?,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,537,"['am', 'aware', 'movie', 'won', 'Oscar', 'truly', 'have', 'not', 'slightest', 'idea', 'why', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'opinion', 'worst', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'Worse', 'even', 'Vicky', 'Christina', 'Barcelona', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'was', 'impossible', 'connect', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'relationship', 'Allen', 'character', 'Annie', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'very', 'strange', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'was', 'able', 'finish', 'watching', 'gave', '2', 'stars']",N/A

275553,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,6301963911,Zack H.,"[3, 4]","""Annie Hall"" is a great film for the ages. Woody Allen does a great job portraying a man who questions modern relationships and struggles through life, so I think most people can relate to this film. With hilarious scenes like when Woody pulls out the author of the book to make one guy look like a schmuck is very funny, it's no wonder why this film won best picture. The film will have you on an emotional roller coaster ride that'll leave you speechless. You'll be laughing, crying, and even cheering for Woody through the film. Although the film is a bit paced, it's still a great movie. Overall, I highly recommend this one. The DVD has been released from MGM, and features a NON-ANAMORPHIC 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Anyway, it's still worth it to buy this film on DVD.",5,Annie Hall,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,888,"['Annie', 'Hall', 'great', 'film', 'ages', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'who', 'questions', 'modern', 'relationships', 'struggles', 'life', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'film', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'when', 'Woody', 'out', 'author', 'book', 'make', 'one', 'guy', 'look', 'schmuck', 'very', 'funny', 'wonder', 'why', 'film', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'speechless', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'crying', 'even', 'cheering', 'Woody', 'film', 'film', 'bit', 'paced', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'DVD', 'been', 'released', 'MGM', 'NON-ANAMORPHIC', '1.85:1', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'have', 'widescreen', 'television', 'will', 'have', 'black', 'bars', 'four', 'sides', 'picture', 'Anyway', 'still', 'worth', 'buy', 'film', 'DVD']",N/A
275554,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,6301963911,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","Full of neuroses and classic comedy bits, Woody Allen's Annie Hall is that rare breed of movie: a romantic comedy that's actually funny, moving, and original.Allen's character, a neurotic standup comic named Alvy Singer, meets free-spirited Annie Hall (played with superb wit and energy by a young Diane Keaton). Their on-again-off-again romance flows throughout the movie leading both of them on a roller coaster of emotions that they both want to stay on and get off of at the same time.Annie Hall features cameos from several of today's stars, although when Annie Hall was filmed these actors were just dayplayers. It's a veritable who's-who of small parts. Jeff Goldblum as a party guest, Sigourney Weaver as one of Alvy's dates, Beverly D'Angelo as a character in a TV show, Truman Capote as a Truman Capote lookalike, and Christopher Walken as Annie's slightly off-kilter brother. Paul Simon also makes an extended appearance as musician Tony Lacey.Annie Hall is the first Woody Allen movie I've seen, and now I can't believe I waited this long. If you're going to see one Woody Allen movie, or just one movie, make it Annie Hall. You won't be disappointed.",5,"A romantic comedy that's actually funny, moving, and original",1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,1163,"['Full', 'neuroses', 'classic', 'comedy', 'bits', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'rare', 'breed', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'actually', 'funny', 'moving', 'character', 'neurotic', 'standup', 'comic', 'named', 'Alvy', 'Singer', 'free-spirited', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'played', 'superb', 'wit', 'energy', 'young', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'on-again-off-again', 'romance', 'movie', 'leading', 'roller', 'coaster', 'emotions', 'want', 'stay', 'get', 'same', 'time.Annie', 'Hall', 'cameos', 'several', 'today', 'stars', 'when', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'was', 'filmed', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'dayplayers', 'veritable', ""who's-who"", 'small', 'parts', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'party', 'guest', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'one', 'Alvy', 'dates', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'character', 'TV', 'show', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'lookalike', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Annie', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'brother', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'also', 'extended', 'appearance', 'musician', 'Tony', 'Lacey.Annie', 'Hall', 'first', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'waited', 'long', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'movie', 'make', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
