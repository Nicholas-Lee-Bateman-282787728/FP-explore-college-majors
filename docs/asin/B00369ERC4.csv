It was wonderful and original, just as it has always been, right from the very beginning.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that when I saw this as a first run series, I missed this particular year of viewing and never knew what had happened to one of the major characters.  I thought one thing, but something else happened and I'm not going to spoil it for anyone who wants to watch a truly original series.

When it came down to actually purchasing past episodes I chose to stop with the second season for one simple reason. When it got to the third season and beyond IT GOT STUPID. This seemed to be a continuing thing with David E. Kelley as Boston Public started good and also became stupid. The second season of Ally McBeal had it's negative traits. For example this was the season that had the famous ""Ally Kissed Billy"" episode that critics and fans complained had been dragged out way too long. It did have it's crazy moments like John Cage and his High Bar dismount from the toilet stall. Probably the funnier moments was with John and his pet frog.
