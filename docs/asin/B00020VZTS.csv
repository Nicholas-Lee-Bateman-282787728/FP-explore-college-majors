It is a creepy atmospheric thriller with lots of disjointed twists and turns. It gets weirder and creepier once the kidnapping of the daughter is underway. I think the screenwriter was trying to evoke Mr. Lynch's spirit. It's not perfect, but has been underrated as a stinker by prior reviewers. I can appreciate what the director was trying to do.As far as acting, Ms. Stowe delivers another solid performance. When has she not? She also looks gorgeous as usual. What bad haircut? Her character Senga is popping pills, is mentally unhinged and stressed from constant conflicts with her rebellious teenage daughter. Definitely a character that our beautiful Ms. Stowe had never tackled before and I give her a thumbs up! Mischa Barton does a good job portraying an emotionally scarred teenager caught between two bickering divorced parents. Who can blame her rebellion and anger? She gives a great bratty performance totally unlike sweet ""Marissa Cooper"" of The O.C. I love her. Norman Reedus is he a good guy or bad guy? Jonathan Rhys-Davies is darkly sexy, perverted and a complete psychopath.The film is shot mostly in half-lighted conditions and locales adding to it's creepy atmosphere.

Apparently this cult seeks bigger things.  After stopping at a diner because the mother is beginning to become sleepy, the daughter picks up a hitchhiker, who tells a tale of her travels to India to the daughter and mother.  Then, things get weird as the hitchhiker asks to be let off at the nearest rest area and immediately disappears leaving her CD featuring Indian chanting.  Later on they stop again and this time they have a spat over concert tickets that the father has given to the daughter in the movie.  This time the cult ends up finding the daughter and kidnapping her.  The rest of the movie is spent as the mother tries to regain her daughter from their evil grasp.  However, towards the end of the movie it begins to make no sense again . . . and the ending completely remains unfulfilling.

820594,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00020VZTS,Only-A-Child,"[16, 17]","Aspiring filmmakers can always count on inspiration from a Marcus Adams production, if stuff this weak is actually making it into $11 Million productions there is hope for everyone no matter how semi-literate or imagination challenged. ""Octane"" aka ""Pulse"" looks like one of those productions that had its inception when a music video production designer stumbled across a neat looking industrial complex and got someone to cobble together a story to feature the set in something more than a music video. It looks like it was written on the back of a napkin at a truck stop because music video director Adams took huge liberties with Stephen Volk's script, and many of these changes were literally made on the set during shooting.Rather than use the set in one of his music videos, Adams assembled a cast and shot a movie long on style and short on intelligence and substance. Imagine a nonsensical mix of ""The Horse Whisperer"", Rosemary's Baby"", and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Volk's original screenplay of a British mother and her 12 year-old daughter trapped in a car on a motorway they could not get off, was fundamentally altered. So much so that Volk seriously considered having his name omitted from the credits. Adams' ""on the fly"" changes destroyed any possibility of unity and logic. Confused viewers searching for hidden meaning and explanations are wasting their time, there is simply no method to the madness.Madeleine Stowe suffers through this with a bad haircut and a general look of stunned surprise. Most likely due to having the her script change on a hourly basis. All this gives the movie a disjointed look.Barton looks pretty used up until her love scene with the cult leader (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) when they put her in heavy eye makeup. With her anorexic face, gap teeth, and big eyes you can really see the Mia Farrow resemblance. Unfortunately Barton has a huge Cameron Diaz smile which tends to spoil the illusion. Her smile is the creepiest thing in the whole movie. Although contrived and silly this scene looks great and almost justifies making the movie-but it would have been much better as just a music video, duh.Beware of a movie with multiple titles. Apparently ""Octane"" refers to the tank truck the cult uses for transportation and making merry, although it is actually a milk truck. Maybe they should have called it ""Lactose"". The how and why of the ""Pulse"" title remains a mystery, there is a hint about vampires but any explanation must have been on Volk's second napkin which he accidentally left behind at the truck stop.Close viewing of ""Octane"" will also be an inspirational experience for aspiring editors as most high school video students are ahead of the movie's post-production people. A particularly glaring jump cut happens early when Stowe runs out of the path of a speeding truck. The long lens makes the truck appear to be about three feet from her as she scrambles out of the way, two seconds later they cut to a side shot and the truck is still several feet from reaching where she had been standing.Think about it, with that same $11 Million to spend Dominique Swain could have cranked out eleven equally lousy movies.Then again, what do I know?

Nat is 15 going on 30, and pushing hard against the bonds Senga tries to place on her.  There are hints and suggestions of a troubled past for Senga which cause her to be more controlling than she might have to be, hints which are never fully resolved. Nat's rebellion finally sends her fleeing into the night at a rest area cafe, right into the waiting arms of a cult of young people who follow a mysterious ""Father"" figure.The story itself is gripping, and the way its presented -- it all happens so quickly, in a single night -- is every parent's worst nightmare. What's more important to the film, though, is the establishment of the mindset of both mother and daughter. Senga, for example, takes pills at several points throughout the film, and while we never find out what those pills are for, we do see that the cult uses them to their advantage. Nat's troubled relationship with her mother seems typical, even superficial at first, but we get flashes that there are deeper problems for both lying under the surface.And it's the mood of the film which really makes it worth watching. Throughout the movie we have the overall sense that something is not right. We don't know if this is Senga's perception, possibly distorted by lack of sleep and/or the pills she is taking, or if there really is something strange going on. Every shot seems tailored to the idea that there is something strange going on over this stretch of road.This is not a film for those who like pat answers or stories which require no effort on the part of the audience. The filmmakers here clearly intended to challenge the audience, to make them question what they're seeing and wonder how much is imagined, and how much is real. Even the ending will likely leave you thinking, and wondering about what you saw.It's that 3 AM feeling you get, when the world is just on the edge between the previous day and the next, when you get the sense that anything can happen.

They have been, it seems, on bad terms recently, and Senga is getting more and more nervous as they drive on.But some curious and unnerving things happen to them on the way home, which they have to deal with on their own.  For starters, one hichhiker (Bijou Phillips) came on board, and mystreiously disappears into the darkness.  Then, after bitter argument with Nat, Senga finds her daughter missing, perhaps kidnapped, in the diner on the roadside.[CREEPY ATMOSPHERE, AWFUL STORY]  Like his previous supernatural horror 'Long Time Dead' Marcus Adams as director shows considerable skills to create creepy atmosphere on the screen.  Though the picture is too dark at times (and almost all the events happen at one night), it also realizes certain amount of strangely unreal feeling of staying up late at 3pm in the morning.But the script is simply awful, especially in the last 30 minutes, where everything is explained with cliched items like 'cult,' and everything still remains confusing and unbelievable.  Norman Reedus plays a 'Recovery Man' whose identity turns out so incredible.  And when Jonathan Rhys-Meyers appears as 'The Father' who utters incomprehensive nonsense before the bedazzled Nat (who listens to them seriously ... no kidding!), everything falls apart.This film reminded me of Peter Fonda's 1975 shocker 'Ride with the Devil' in which four unsuspecting travellers are terrorized by the mysterious local cult group.  Though that film was a B-action/horror film, it was at least coherent to the end.
