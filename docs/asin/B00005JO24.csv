638482,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JO24,A Customer,"[1, 1]","It's big, bold loud and brash - there's nothing remotely subtle about The Producers. The comedy is slapstick and hammy, and the production numbers are belted out within an inch of their life. Although there are some fun things about this film, and the lavish production are indeed its strong point, however, I found it uneven, full of dated stereotypes with the laughs coming in dribs and drabs.Since it's acted, sung and mostly shot like it's still taking place on a live theater stage, everything is much louder, broader and, well, stagier than how we're used to seeing things done in movies. This is fine except that none of the characters' performances have been scaled down to make sense on-screen. Every gesture is played out as if the actors are practically sitting in your lap.Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are pretty good as the conniving operator Max and his tremulous accountant, Leo Bloom, who decide to stage a version of the politically incorrect Springtime for Hitler in the hope that it will be a monumental flop and solicit them two millions bucks. Uma Thurman is delightful as sexy-secretary Ulla. Yes, she's got great legs and a nice voice but is clearly no musical-comedy pro.First written in 1968 Mel Brooks probably saw this as the hight of fastball schlock, the way he tosses out little bits of ridiculousness. The movie version retains the integrity of the original show and is intent to assault our very senses. Director Susan Stroman is obviously comfortable with the material, since she did the stage show, and she films it simply, with a lot of straight-on full shots and judicious editing.Visually, however, the film doesn't take many risks and Stroman basically encourages everyone to just do it louder and BELT IT! And I am amazed that one of the big production numbers featuring an array of prancing, preening extras, as well as Roger Bart in a black turtleneck outfit laden with chains and pendant-style magnifying glasses, is anything other than homophobic, intent to poke fun and make us laugh at effeminate men. Depending where your coming from, some viewers may find it offensive. After all, what is supposed to be funny about effeminate men?Also, The Producers clocks in at just over two hours, which is far too long for this kind of thing; in fact some of the solo songs could have been cut entirely.  When opening night for Springtime for Hitler arrives, it comes as something of a relief, though also a source of confusion. Here are numbers that are supposed to be awful, which must mean that the rest of the movie is just terrible by accident.

638484,A34ZH5K0EHL8P0,B00005JO24,"Adam A. Fine ""Caretaker of the Arts""","[11, 15]","Converting a theatrical performance-- musical or otherwise-- to the big screen is inherently one of the toughest acts in the 20th century entertainment canon to pull off. By its very nature, the musical demands a live audience. Suspension of disbelief is a core requirement when characters burst into song. Live theater demands audience interaction. Yet in transferring the medium to film, the audience by nature is silent and detached. A show-stopper on a live stage can be 10 minutes of tedium on film, a powerhouse performance turns oddly flat and emotionless. What works in the theater easily falls flat on screen. Witness the litany of great shows rendered impotent, most often for direction, for their inability to transfer. Those musicals on screen that do work are exceptions to a rule-- and when they do work, they transcend both stylistic forms, and create masterpieces.So where does that leave ""The Producers,"" a gem of a musical conceived with so much film talent, its Broadway run might almost have been an out-of-town tryout for the inevitable film version? (Picking up a dozen Tonys on the way, thank you very  much.) Well, it leaves it much where it found it-- on the stage.""The Producers"" is a great movie. Where it best succeeds is in capturing the theatrical performance for posterity. It's main problem is that it never truly leaves the confines of the theater to allow for some expansion, a little air to breathe. And what works brilliantly on stage simply doesn't transfer as seamlessly to the screen as director Susan Stroman doubtlessly believed. ""Along Came Bialy"" goes on far too long and needs some rethinking; ""Betrayed"" is an exercise in claustrophobia that even the brilliant Nathan Lane can't save on film. Stroman succeeds better with Broderick's numbers, particularly ""I Wanna Be A Producer,"" which gets all the fantasy fanfare a film can provide-- gotta love a fantasy/dream-sequence number. And a throwaway like ""That Face"" turns into a glorious ode to the 1940s Kelly/Astaire musical, with Broderick in top form.Yet this is Nathan Lane's vehicle, make no mistake. Broderick's whiny nebbish of an accountant (Leo Bloom) played well on stage, but here he's either far too one-dimensional, way too naive, or blatantly invoking Gene Wilder (1968's original Leo Bloom). Lane, however, is brilliant. His signature rubber-faced, panic-manic comedy are at their height here. On film (""The Birdcage,"" ""Jeffrey"") or on stage (""Guys & Dolls,"" Love! Valour!..."" ""A Funny Thing Happened...""), the man is simply a genius. Just watching him, hearing his vocal inflections, his sense of timing-- he's an absolute joy. Thankfully, the DVD features the deleted ""King of Broadway"" scene, which never should have been removed-- whether it was in the interest of time or giving more film to Broderick is a good question. More importantly, he's made the role his own-- nothing is stolen from the late, great Zero Mostel.The supporting cast is hit or miss. What worked on stage for Roger Beach and Gary Bart as Roger DeBris and Carmen Ghia now is just borderline funny, though Beach pulls out the stops when he goes on as Hitler during the show's opus, the marvelous ""Springtime For Hitler."" Gary Bart simply lacks appeal.Will Ferrell is the biggest surprise of all as the perfectly loony and vocally proficient Nazi Franz Liebkind. I've never been a big fan of Ferrell's, but his supporting role here has completely changed my mind. I was amazed at the guy's mastery of the role-- the part's not terribly large, but he (literally) towers in it (he's very tall).Unfortunately, Uma Thurman as Ulla is a downright disappointment, tossing away lines and terribly lacking in one of the show's brightest numbers, ""When You Got It, Flaunt It,"" performed so brilliantly by Kady Hoffman in the Broadway production. She's oddly intense, phyiscally vague and overly dramatic in a role designed as a brilliant parody of the classic Swedish buxom blond. Thurman is a talented actress but is a major disappointment here, dragging down her scenes with all the bouyancy of a peroxide anvil.Mel Brooks make his token appearance twice, once vocally and once again at the very end-- the very, very end. He wrote a new song for Lane and Broderick called ""There's Noting Like A Show On Broadway"" that rolls over the credits and is really quite good. Fact is, Brooks is everywhere, given that he wrote all the songs, and the story-- now in its third incarnation-- was his breakthrough back in 1968.I would have said 3 stars, but the songs are so classic, and Lane is so brilliant, they earn it the 4th star. Would that countless other musicals were so faithful to their Broadway roots. This should have been an ""excellent"" film version of the musical, and it should have been an Oscar contender. We'll have to settle for a ""great"" version... and hope that Nathan Lane goes on to do a few more movies, despite how much he'll be missed on Broadway.",4,Faithful-- to a fault-- but well worth the effort.,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,4938,"['Converting', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'musical', 'otherwise', 'big', 'screen', 'inherently', 'one', 'toughest', 'acts', '20th', 'century',

(For an analogy, imagine a comedian who intermittently breaks out into motivational seminars.)  That said, some are better than others.  However, going from musical to movie is another kettle of fish altogether.  In Moulin Rouge this was accomplished with great success, unfortunately, with The Producers, you have a poem that's been translated too many times.The original 1968 film not only launched the career of arguably our funniest director, it demonstrated that where others saw sacred cows worthy of reverence, Brooks saw hamburgers.  The result was one of the most jubilant pieces of political incorrectness ever - a wickedly funny masterpiece.  Fantastic performances abound, especially Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.But that was 1968, and the jokes had become cultural touchstones long before Brooks re-warmed the platter for Broadway.  While his love for musical theatre is well known (think Young Frankenstein's ""Puttin' On The Ritz"") the songs for this show are downright lousy.  The net result is mutton dressed as lamb - baaaad.Nathan Lane is winning, but lacks the larger than life swagger of Zero Mostel so essential to the story; his campy delivery is right for the stage, but not for film.  Matthew Broderick dances adroitly.  Amazingly, neither Lane nor Broderick sing well - how did this happen?  Uma Thurman is tall, and watching her dance with Broderick, (who comes up to her navel), should be funny - presumably it isn't because there's absolutely no chemistry between them.  Will Ferrell delivers yet another irksome Will Farrell performance; this time it's pigeons that steal his laughs.Fortunately there are some minor characters providing grace notes along they way.  Gary Beach (Roger DeBris) has the film's best voice and delivery, and his assistant, (Carmen Ghia), played by Roger Bart, matches the original - not easy!  Presumably the ""big song and dance numbers"" - a room full of accountants - little old ladies tap dancing with their walkers - played well on the Great White Way but here just feel like annoying filler.  Nathan Lane's retelling of the entire story while incarcerated is egregious padding, (although it's true, he's not that fat).Do yourself a favor, get the original Mel Brooks film; it's a comic gem that will brighten any collection.

638487,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JO24,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[1, 5]","A few years ago, The Producers became a sensation on Broadway.  Adapting Mel Brooks' movie about slimy Broadway producer Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) and his timid accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) who tried to put on the worst play in history into a musical, the show won many Tony awards as well as critical acclaim and must-see buzz.Max Bialystock was once an acclaimed producer until a string of flops left him penniless.  He is a scumbag who exploits little old ladies for cash in order to produce his flops, as well as keeping some for himself.  Leo Bloom is an accountant who never broke any rule and leads a boring life.  He gets nervous easily and requires his ""blue blanket"" from when he was a baby to keep him from going into fits of hysterics (look for it in the courtroom scene!).  Obviously, the two start off as a shaky pair.  When Bloom realizes that if a producer can make a fortune off of a flop, Bialystock decides to put the plan into action.  They decide to take a play called Springtime for Hitler, written by Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell), a Nazi who doesn't seem to know that the war is over.  The play is basically a tasteless love letter to Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun.  Along with Roger de Bris (Gary Beach), whom Bialstock labels the worst director in town, the play makes it to Broadway.  Rounding out the cast is Ulla (Uma Thurman), a curvy Swede who acts as secretary/receptionist as well as a cast member in the upcoming play.I can't quite put my finger on why the story didn't work as a movie in the same way it does as a play.  Both Lane and Broderick are great in their respective roles, and newcomers Thurman and Ferrell are both great (Ferrell is absolutely hilarious).

The most fun-filled, laugh out loud funny musical comedy of the year delights mainly due to the outstanding performances of Lane and Broderick.The story is as old as 1968 when Mel Brooks gifted us with the original movie.  The accountant who inadvertently gives the Broadway producer the tip of a lifetime----produce the worst play of all time and pocket the backing-is a singing, dancing romp that leaves you feeling you have seen the best of Broadway at the movies.  No one but Nathan Lane could ever bring all the sleaze of Max Bialystock to life with such hilarity; no one but Matthew Broderick could make the nerdy Leo Bloom so enchanting: and no one but Uma Thurman could convince us such a stunningly seductive woman could fall for either.Will Ferrell shines as the playwright enamored with Hitler and thrilled to bring his ""Springtime for Hitler"" to the stage in one of the movie's best production numbers, the other being the sex-starved old ladies dancing desperately with their walkers.Bawdy writing by Mel Brooks and the inimitable mugging of Lane and Broderick make this a must-see for fans of musicals.",5,Broderick and Lane Bring Their Broadway Hit To The Big Screen,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,1368,"['was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'would', 'reprise', 'Broadway', 'performances', 'big', 'screen', 'When', 'live', '1,000', 'miles', 'New', 'York', 'often', 'rely', 'movies', 'bring', 'little', 'gems', 'gem', 'most', 'fun-filled', 'loud', 'funny', 'musical', 'comedy', 'year', 'delights', 'mainly', 'due', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Lane', 'Broderick.The', 'story', 'as', 'old', '1968', 'when', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'gifted', 'original', 'movie', 'accountant', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'Broadway', 'producer', 'tip', 'lifetime', 'produce', 'worst', 'play', 'time', 'pocket', 'backing-is', 'singing', 'dancing', 'romp', 'feeling', 'have', 'seen', 'best', 'Broadway', 'movies', 'one', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'could', 'ever', 'bring', 'sleaze', 'Max', 'Bialystock', 'life', 'such', 'hilarity', 'one', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'could', 'make', 'nerdy', 'Leo', 'Bloom', 'enchanting', 'one', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'could', 'convince', 'stunningly', 'seductive', 'woman', 'could', 'fall', 'either.Will', 'Ferrell', 'playwright', 'enamored', 'Hitler', 'thrilled', 'bring', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'stage', 'one', 'movie', 'best', 'production', 'numbers', 'other', 'being', 'sex-starved', 'old', 'ladies', 'dancing', 'desperately', 'walkers.Bawdy', 'writing', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'inimitable', 'mugging', 'Lane', 'Broderick', 'make', 'must-see', 'fans', 'musicals']",N/A

I was able to follow the plotline really easily and I laughed at just about every scene in the movie.  I also liked the fact that there were no swear words in the movie that I could recall, and while there are several refences, there weren't any actual sex scenes, which as a nice change to me.I didn't know that this was a remake of a movie from the 1960's, nor that it was a play on Broadway, but why should anyone be surprised?  After all, it seems that half the movies they come out with nowadays, are remakes of some movie put out in the 50's or 60's. I am not one who cares whether or not something is a remake; if a plot appeals to me, like this one did, then I will watch it, regardless.Several other reviewrs have pointed out that this wasn't as good as the original, but you know what; so what?  Seriously. The origianl was put out, what, almost fourty years ago? I wasn't around then, and truth be told, if I were to sit and watch the original version of this film, I probably wouldn't really understand several of the refrences or the black humor that version supposedly has.I thoroughly enjoyed this and am planning to buy it as soon as I can.  Don't let those reviewers who said this wasn't as good as the original deter you from making up your mind one way or the other on whether or not you should watch it.

I acknowledged all the kudos and Tonys but I just thought I would not like it even though I am a huge Matthew Broderick fan.  Boy do I regret not seeing it now.  Thank God this film is so well made, has Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane and allows me to settle for second best next to seeing it live.The story flows effortlessly here and plays like a Broadway musical.  When the characters burst into song or especially with the big numbers the screen comes to life and you feel as if you are seeing it live.  The story is simple yet ingenious.  Nathan Lane is a former famous producer who hasn't had a hit in years.  Matthew Broderick, a nerdy accountant, enters to review his books but lo and behold he has always had a secret desire to be a Broadway producer.  He realizes that more money could be made with a flop than a hit.  They become partners and look for the worst musical, the worst director and the worst actors.  The entire film is laugh out loud hilarious and both Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick bring the high energy and musicality that most certainly thrilled live.Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell were not on Broadway but here they fit their parts perfectly.  Both show exceptional talent at musicality and comedic timing.All the musical numbers shine and when song and dance are combined the movie gives you such a feel good feeling.  I love the whole cast but Matthew Broderick shines for me with both his acting and singing/dancing.  The standout number is the huge production number I WANNA BE A PRODUCER and THAT FACE which he does with Uma Thurman is glorious.  Other standouts are WE CAN DO IT, KEEP IT GAY, WHEN YOU GOT IT FLAUNT IT and SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.  Nathan Lane shines in the solo BETRAYED and he and Matthew Broderick have perfect chemistry in the touching TIL HIM.  Mathew Broderick and Nathan Lane were made for these roles and their full exceptional talent is in full display.  They make a perfect team and the chemistry provides laughs galore.  Thank God they agreed to make the film version.  Without them the movie would not have succeeded.Watch this movie to feel good, laugh hysterically and be prepared to sing and dance for days.

Once one is acclimated to that, however, this is a great, great time, although one that always feels very much like the filmed version of a stage play and not necessarily like a movie musical.The basic story and story-within-a-story are as hilariously profane as ever, meaning this movie is not for children or for the easily offended. Mel Brooks takes a machine gun approach to every sacred cow on Broadway and his willingness to push the boundaries in the 1960s still feels quite edgy today.The television and film actors he casts in the movie -- some in blink-and-miss them roles, like Andrea Martin and Michael McKean -- all acquit themselves well and bring an extra layer of polish to things, although I imagine fans of the Broadway show will complain, possibly with merit, that the original stage actors should have been given a chance to perform before a wider audience.Still, this is a dazzling film and side-splittingly funny.Strongly recommended for fans of Mel Brooks (stick around after the credits to see him appear in the film of the musical of his old film), the strong cast (Will Ferrell does an especially good job in his role as a maniacal Nazi-turned-playright) or folks who are just curious about what all the fuss was about on Broadway.",4,Wonderfully over the top Mel Brooks musical,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,1587,"['Be', 'forewarned', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Producers', 'are', 'little', 'surprising', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'relative', 'subtlety', 'normal', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'movie', 'film', 'musical', 'based', 'original', 'film', 'done', 'bigger', 'life', 'acting', 'never', 'dropping', 'down', 'this-is-for-the-folks-in-the-back-row', 'level', 'Once', 'one', 'acclimated', 'however', 'great', 'great', 'time', 'one', 'always', 'very', 'much', 'filmed', 'version', 'stage', 'play', 'not', 'necessarily', 'movie', 'musical.The', 'basic', 'story', 'story-within-a-story', 'are', 'hilariously', 'profane', 'ever', 'meaning', 'movie', 'not', 'children', 'easily', 'offended', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'machine', 'gun', 'approach', 'sacred', 'cow', 'Broadway', 'willingness', 'push', 'boundaries', '1960s', 'still', 'quite', 'edgy', 'today.The', 'television', 'film', 'actors', 'movie', 'blink-and-miss', 'roles', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'acquit', 'well', 'bring', 'extra', 'layer', 'polish', 'things', 'imagine', 'fans', 'Broadway', 'show', 'will', 'complain', 'possibly', 'merit', 'original', 'stage', 'actors', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'perform', 'wider', 'audience.Still', 'dazzling', 'film', 'side-splittingly', 'funny.Strongly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'stick', 'around', 'credits', 'see', 'appear', 'film', 'musical', 'old', 'film', 'strong', 'cast', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'especially', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'maniacal', 'Nazi-turned-playright', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'curious', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'Broadway']",N/A

I still think it is one of Mel Brooks' best films. So I was a bit apprehensive when I heard it was being turned into a Broadway musical and then that musical was being made into a film. But, on the whole, I have to admit to enjoying it much more than I thought I would.Much of the credit must go to Susan Stroman's stagey and somewhat campy direction, which suits the material perfectly. Even more credit belongs to the incredible Nathan Lane for managing to equal Zero Mostel's original Max Bialystock and even, once or twice, surpassing it. He is, quite rightly, the heart and soul, of the film. The rest of the cast is not bad either. Uma Thurman is a pleasant surprise, the double act of Gary Beach and Roger Bart are pure politically-incorrect joy, and even Will Farrell is good. Which leaves Matthew Broderick. He certainly comes to life when singing and dancing, much more so than I would have expected. But his characterisation of Leo Bloom seems just a bit too bland. I know Leo is supposed to a personality-deficient accountant, but I really miss Gene Wilder's manic edge. With Broderick, there's not even a hint in the eyes that he really needs that blue blanket.It was fun spotting all the lines of dialogue from the original and seeing how the story and characters were altered (I could understand LSD not fitting into the new concept but the playing of Hitler first by Hans, then by DeBris seemed a tad awkward). But, this being a musical version, the show is going to rise or fall on its musical numbers. In general, the staging was clever and often laugh out loud funny. The songs, it must be said, are not the most memorable ever heard on Broadway. But the energy and enthusiasm with which they are performed more than make up for that. Strange then that some of them are edited. The opening number ends so abruptly - I'm grateful that the DVD has the entire number as an extra. I can see no real reason why it was cut short (unless someone felt it was too Jewish). Surely, running times are not the crucial factor they used to be. But many delights survive including a chorus line of grannies with walking frames, beautiful girls dressed only in pearls, and Uma Thurman doing a quite good Cyd Charisse impersonation with her seemingly endless legs. In fact, the only real musical disappointment for me was the notorious Springtime For Hitler number which seemed to lack the punch, fizz and open-mouth shock quality of the original. Maybe it's the passage of time or just knowing that it was coming. But Nathan Lane's Betrayed number was soooo good that I had to rewind for an instant encore.All in all, it's nice to see that someone can still do a good old-fashioned musical.",4,Where Did They Go Right?,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,2793,"['remember', 'seeing', 'original', 'film', 'Producers', 'virtually', 'deserted', 'theatre', 'loving', 'still', 'think', 'one', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'best', 'films', 'was', 'bit', 'apprehensive', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'being', 'turned', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'then', 'musical', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'film', 'whole', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoying', 'much', 'more', 'thought', 'would.Much', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'Susan', 'Stroman', 'stagey', 'somewhat', 'campy', 'direction', 'suits', 'material', 'perfectly', 'Even', 'more', 'credit', 'belongs', 'incredible', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'managing', 'equal', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'original', 'Max', 'Bialystock', 'even', 'once', 'twice', 'surpassing', 'quite', 'rightly', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'rest', 'cast', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'double', 'act', 'Gary', 'Beach', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'are', 'pure', 'politically-incorrect', 'joy', 'even', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'good', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'certainly', 'life', 'when', 'singing', 'dancing', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'characterisation', 'Leo', 'Bloom', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'bland', 'know', 'Leo', 'supposed', 'personality-deficient', 'accountant', 'really', 'miss', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'manic', 'edge', 'Broderick', 'not', 'even', 'hint', 'eyes', 'really', 'blue', 'blanket.It', 'was', 'fun', 'spotting', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'original', 'seeing', 'how', 'story', 'characters', 'were', 'altered', 'could', 'understand', 'LSD', 'not', 'fitting', 'new', 'concept', 'playing', 'Hitler', 'first', 'Hans', 'then', 'DeBris', 'seemed', 'tad', 'awkward', 'being', 'musical', 'version', 'show', 'going', 'rise', 'fall', 'musical', 'numbers', 'general', 'staging', 'was', 'clever', 'often', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'songs', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'are', 'not', 'most', 'memorable', 'ever', 'heard', 'Broadway', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'are', 'performed', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'Strange', 'then', 'are', 'edited', 'opening', 'number', 'so', 'abruptly', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'DVD', 'entire', 'number', 'extra', 'can', 'see', 'real', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'someone', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'Jewish', 'Surely', 'running', 'times', 'are', 'not', 'crucial', 'factor', 'used', 'be', 'many', 'delights', 'survive', 'including', 'chorus', 'line', 'grannies', 'walking', 'frames', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'dressed', 'only', 'pearls', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'doing', 'quite', 'good', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'impersonation', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'legs', 'fact', 'only', 'real', 'musical', 'disappointment', 'was', 'notorious', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'number', 'seemed', 'lack', 'punch', 'fizz', 'open-mouth', 'shock', 'quality', 'original', 'Maybe', 'passage', 'time', 'just', 'knowing', 'was', 'coming', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Betrayed', 'number', 'was', 'soooo', 'good', 'had', 'rewind', 'instant', 'encore.All', 'nice', 'see', 'someone', 'can', 'still', 'do', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'musical']",N/A
638513,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JO24,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 2]","This iteration of 'The Producers' has the thankless task of being compared to both the Broadway live performance, and to the original film that gave rise to that musical.  The journey from film to musical requires obvious alterations - songs must be written, for example.  However, the filmakers of this re-adaptation back to a film did not properly appreciate the problems of the musical-film transition, and the errors very nearly ruin the film.  Fortunately, the performances rescue any the miscues and the result is a more watchable (read: less edgy and controversial) version of the classic 1968 film.Let me make it clear that I enjoy musicals when I am in the theatre.  Unfortunately, filmed musicals (those adapted from stage) almost always fall into two traps, both of which are evident here.  #1: The filmakers try to include too many songs, forgetting that a musical can sustain interest in the second half because there is a 1/2 hour intermission.  Especially with a comedy, pacing is everything, and filmed musical comedies always wear out their welcomes by running past 120 minutes.  Such is the case with this film - it drags on interminably, with two completely pointless songs (Betrayed and 'Til Him) tacked on.  #2: Production numbers (dance numbers) on stage almost never look good on the screen.  The dance number with the old ladies tapping their walkers may be objectively clever and funny, but just doesn't work in this film.  The only set-piece dance number that does work is Bloom's fantasy with the ""Beautiful girls wearing nothing but pearls"" number where he sings I Wanna Be a Producer.  The latter works because it makes sense in the context of the movie - someone fantasizing about being a Broadway producer is obviously going to fantasize in Broadway terms.There are some other annoyances: you never believe Matthew Broderick is ""hysterical"" in the famous scene where Bloom and Bialystock met.  Gene Wilder could play hysterical; Broderick does not (or cannot) - why wasn't the part re-visioned with Bloom as a cowardly wallflower (which is how he's played later in the film)?  Secondly, many of the songs are banal: I don't expect the most intricate music in a musical comedy, but the tunes sound like cookie-cutter Simpsons-esque paradies of musical music.  I am especially referring to ""That Face"" and ""'Til Him.""  And finally: in 1968, the WWII was still a living memory for many moviegoers.  To maintain the edge of the original film, the show would have to be about, say, an ex-Baathist writing a song called ""Springtime for Saddam.""Despite all these issues, the film is extremely funny and enjoyable (except for the aforementioned dragged-out ending).  Some of the changes from the original film are actually improvements: for example, the decision to do away with the flower-child actor L.S.D.  It only makes sense that Bloom and Bialystock would try trying to cast the role of Hitler straight, which makes it (to me) even funnier when DeVries is forced into the show and we end up with a flamingly homosexual Hitler.  Further, the roles are impeccably cast (sometimes surprisingly so - is that really Uma Thurman singing?).  I especially like Nathan Lane and Will Farrell.This DVD edition is not large, but does include some interesting extras - for example, an entire song cut from the film (which, in my opinion, is better than several of the songs they left in), and a featurette on producing the big ""I Wanna Be a Producer"" number.",4,"Not as edgy as the original film, but possibly more enjoyable",1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,3474,"['iteration', ""'The"", 'Producers', 'thankless', 'task', 'being', 'compared', 'Broadway', 'live', 'performance', 'original', 'film', 'gave', 'rise', 'musical', 'journey', 'film', 'musical', 'obvious', 'alterations', 'songs', 'must', 'be', 'written', 'example', 'However', 'filmakers', 're-adaptation', 'back', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'properly', 'appreciate', 'problems', 'musical-film', 'transition', 'errors', 'very', 'nearly', 'ruin', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'performances', 'rescue', 'miscues', 'result', 'more', 'watchable', 'read', 'less', 'edgy', 'controversial', 'version', 'classic', '1968', 'film.Let', 'make', 'clear', 'enjoy', 'musicals', 'when', 'am', 'theatre', 'Unfortunately', 'filmed', 'musicals', 'adapted', 'stage', 'almost', 'always', 'fall', 'two', 'traps', 'are', 'evident', 'here', '1', 'filmakers', 'try', 'include', 'too', 'many', 'songs', 'forgetting', 'musical', 'can', 'sustain', 'interest', 'second', 'half', '1/2', 'hour', 'intermission', 'Especially', 'comedy', 'pacing', 'everything', 'filmed', 'musical', 'comedies', 'always', 'wear', 'out', 'welcomes', 'running', 'past', '120', 'minutes', 'Such', 'case', 'film', 'interminably', 'two', 'completely', 'pointless', 'songs', 'Betrayed', ""'Til"", 'Him', 'tacked', '2', 'Production', 'numbers', 'dance', 'numbers', 'stage', 'almost', 'never', 'look', 'good', 'screen', 'dance', 'number', 'old', 'ladies', 'tapping', 'walkers', 'may', 'be', 'objectively', 'clever', 'funny', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'only', 'set-piece', 'dance', 'number', 'work', 'Bloom', 'fantasy', 'Beautiful', 'girls', 'wearing', 'nothing', 'pearls', 'number', 'where', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Producer', 'latter', 'works', 'sense', 'context', 'movie', 'someone', 'fantasizing', 'being', 'Broadway', 'producer', 'obviously', 'going', 'fantasize', 'Broadway', 'are', 'other', 'annoyances', 'never', 'believe', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'hysterical', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'Bloom', 'Bialystock', 'met', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'could', 'play', 'hysterical', 'Broderick', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 're-visioned', 'Bloom', 'cowardly', 'wallflower', 'how', 'played', 'later', 'film', 'Secondly', 'many', 'songs', 'are', 'banal', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'most', 'intricate', 'music', 'musical', 'comedy', 'tunes', 'sound', 'cookie-cutter', 'Simpsons-esque', 'paradies', 'musical', 'music', 'am', 'especially', 'referring', 'Face', ""'Til"", 'Him', 'finally', '1968', 'WWII', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'memory', 'many', 'moviegoers', 'maintain', 'edge', 'original', 'film', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'say', 'ex-Baathist', 'writing', 'song', 'called', 'Springtime', 'Saddam', 'issues', 'film', 'extremely', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'aforementioned', 'dragged-out', 'ending', 'changes', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'improvements', 'example', 'decision', 'do', 'away', 'flower-child', 'actor', 'L.S.D', 'only', 'sense', 'Bloom', 'Bialystock', 'would', 'try', 'trying', 'cast', 'role', 'Hitler', 'straight', 'even', 'funnier', 'when', 'DeVries', 'forced', 'show', 'end', 'up', 'flamingly', 'homosexual', 'Hitler', 'Further', 'roles', 'are', 'impeccably', 'cast', 'sometimes', 'surprisingly', 'really', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'singing', 'especially', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Will', 'Farrell.This', 'DVD', 'edition', 'not', 'large', 'include', 'interesting', 'extras', 'example', 'entire', 'song', 'cut', 'film', 'opinion', 'better', 'several', 'songs', 'left', 'featurette', 'producing', 'big', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Producer', 'number']",N/A

The premise was funny, the performances were good, the songs were great, but the ending was too forced.  I like happy endings, except when they seem contrived, which was the case with this show.  Interestingly and somewhat disappointingly, the movie strives to be no more than a copy of the Broadway show.  This creates a series of problems, especially with the dialogue.  Some of it does not work in a movie setting.  Recently, Chicago triumphed as a movie thanks to it very clever adaptation.  The Director of Producers considers filming a few outdoor scenes to be sufficient to adapt this show and that is not the case.  There are several other adaptation issues:  (1) Uma is beautiful but cannot sing--they really should have dubbed her singing voice; (2) Nathan and Matthew are too theatrical in their performances; and (3) Matthew is too old for this part and it shows on the screen.  That aside, I loved the supporting cast.  Gary Beach, Roger Bart and Will Ferrell are simply BRILLIANT.  The sequence of Sprintime for Hitler is BREATHTAKING.  Talk about showstopper!

638518,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JO24,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","I'm sure it came as a surprise to many that The Producers basically bombed at the box office, given the critical acclaim of the Broadway show - especially given the fact that Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprised the roles they had performed before countless packed theater audiences.  Sometimes a Broadway show just can't make a completely successful transition to the screen, and that seems to be what happened here to some extent.  This is a good, funny movie, but it oftentimes plays like a show rather than a movie.  Most surprisingly to me, Matthew Broderick proves to be the film's weakest link; he plays every scene during the first half of the movie as if he is acting on stage, and it just doesn't work on film.  If I didn't already know how talented an actor Broderick is, the first half of this film would probably have had me thinking this is the worst actor I've ever seen in my life.  As far as the box office goes, you also have to factor in the fact that The Producers alienates a couple of different interest groups by openly ridiculing them in ways Hollywood really doesn't allow any more.Even those of you who, like me, will probably never get a chance to see a Broadway show, probably already know the story here.  You've got two producers trying to make a fortune by raising tons of money, then putting on a show so terrible that it is bound to close on opening night, leaving them to enjoy the bounteous surplus riches provided by their backers.  Combing through all the bad screenplays they can get their hands on, they come across a screenplay for a little gem called Springtime for Hitler and quickly snatch up the rights from its undeniably strange author.  Then they get the worst director they can find to put the show together, all but guaranteeing that audience members will walk out of the theatre before their seats get good and warm.  A funny thing happens on the way to the unprecedented flop, though - the audience actually loves the show, viewing it as mad satire rather than an ill-fated attempt to rewrite history in Hitler's favor.If you ask me, Nathan Lane pretty much carries this movie on his back.  Even during the second half of the movie, Broderick still looks to me as if he is consciously acting, whereas Lane basically is his character from start to finish.  Uma Thurman is delightful as Ulla and Will Ferrell is his usual hilarious self as Springtime for Hitler writer Franz Liebkind, but these and their fellow supporting actors come and go as the movie continuously revolves around the two producers themselves.The Producers is a smart, very funny movie (the original story, after all, did come from Mel Brooks, so you know it's going to make you laugh), but the engine that drives it just seems to skip every once and a while.  I'm certainly thankful to finally get a chance to see this production that I have heard so much about, but I have to believe the actual Broadway show presented the story more effectively than the film.  On a final note, let me just recommend that viewers sit through the end credits, as there's a pretty worthwhile extra tacked on at the very end.",4,"Very funny, but it doesn't seem to make a complete transition from stage production to film",1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,3133,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'came', 'surprise', 'many', 'Producers', 'basically', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'given', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'Broadway', 'show', 'especially', 'given', 'fact', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'reprised', 'roles', 'had', 'performed', 'countless', 'packed', 'theater', 'audiences', 'Sometimes', 'Broadway', 'show', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'completely', 'successful', 'transition', 'screen', 'be', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'extent', 'good', 'funny', 'movie', 'plays', 'show', 'rather', 'movie', 'Most', 'surprisingly', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'be', 'film', 'weakest', 'link', 'scene', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'acting', 'stage', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'how', 'talented', 'actor', 'Broderick', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'had', 'thinking', 'worst', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'As', 'far', 'box', 'office', 'also', 'have', 'factor', 'fact', 'Producers', 'couple', 'different', 'interest', 'groups', 'openly', 'ridiculing', 'ways', 'Hollywood', 'really', ""n't"", 'allow', 'more.Even', 'who', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Broadway', 'show', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'here', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'producers', 'trying', 'make', 'fortune', 'raising', 'tons', 'money', 'then', 'putting', 'show', 'so', 'terrible', 'bound', 'close', 'opening', 'night', 'leaving', 'enjoy', 'bounteous', 'surplus', 'riches', 'provided', 'backers', 'Combing', 'bad', 'screenplays', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'come', 'screenplay', 'little', 'gem', 'called', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'quickly', 'snatch', 'up', 'rights', 'undeniably', 'strange', 'author', 'Then', 'get', 'worst', 'director', 'can', 'find', 'put', 'show', 'together', 'guaranteeing', 'audience', 'members', 'will', 'walk', 'theatre', 'seats', 'get', 'good', 'warm', 'funny', 'thing', 'way', 'unprecedented', 'flop', 'audience', 'actually', 'show', 'viewing', 'mad', 'satire', 'rather', 'ill-fated', 'attempt', 'rewrite', 'history', 'Hitler', 'favor.If', 'ask', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'back', 'Even', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'Broderick', 'still', 'consciously', 'acting', 'whereas', 'Lane', 'basically', 'character', 'start', 'finish', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'delightful', 'Ulla', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'usual', 'hilarious', 'self', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'writer', 'Franz', 'Liebkind', 'fellow', 'supporting', 'actors', 'come', 'go', 'movie', 'continuously', 'two', 'producers', 'themselves.The', 'Producers', 'smart', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'original', 'story', 'did', 'come', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'know', 'going', 'make', 'laugh', 'engine', 'just', 'skip', 'once', 'while', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'thankful', 'finally', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'production', 'have', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'believe', 'actual', 'Broadway', 'show', 'presented', 'story', 'more', 'effectively', 'film', 'final', 'note', 'let', 'just', 'recommend', 'viewers', 'sit', 'end', 'credits', 'pretty', 'worthwhile', 'extra', 'tacked', 'very', 'end']",N/A

But, even though it clocks in at just shy of two and a half hours, it never feels long at all. In fact, it felt to be only an hour and a half, and I was suprised when I got out how long it really was. It made me think that there are way too many two and a half, three hour movies that come out in December. ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"", ""Munich"", a movie that looks great but I have not seen yet, ""King Kong"", ""Walk The Line"", ""Syriana"". All of them were good movies, with the exception of ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"" and ""Munich"", both of which I have not seen yet, but all of them were two and a half or three hours long. With some of them, like ""King Kong"" and ""Syriana"", it diminished the quality. But with the others it didn't matter, this included in that ranking. One of my absolute, hands-down favorite movies of this year, ""A History Of Violence"", was not even an hour and a half long. It was about 83 minutes long. It had action, twists, suspense, and great storytelling. Another one of my favorites this year, ""In Her Shoes"", was 133 minutes long and felt like about 90. But one of the other movies of this year that I loved (for no reason in particular, and for no reason I can distinguish), ""Domino"", was two hours and nine minutes, but felt like three hours. ""The Producers"" is so briskly paced, funny, and just plain zaney in it's delievery that it never had me asking myself what time it was or wanting to leave and watch it on video, a la ""King Kong"". This movie definetely has the feel of a Mel Brooks movie, from its risque sexual humor to the insane song and dance numbers that most of the time go ways over the top. Will Ferrel is hilarious as a Nazi/playwrite, and even though the movie dips heavily into race, religion, and violence for its comedy in the later half, it never feels racist, anti-semetic, or overly violent (there is only one scene of onscreen violence, after all).",5,An Absoloutely Hilarious Musical Comedy; By Far One Of The Best Of The Year,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,1930,"['Producers', 'remake', 'long', 'movie', 'even', 'just', 'shy', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'never', 'long', 'fact', 'felt', 'be', 'only', 'hour', 'half', 'was', 'suprised', 'when', 'got', 'out', 'how', 'long', 'really', 'was', 'made', 'think', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'two', 'half', 'three', 'hour', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'December', 'Memoirs', 'A', 'Geisha', 'Munich', 'movie', 'great', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'King', 'Kong', 'Walk', 'Line', 'Syriana', 'were', 'good', 'movies', 'exception', 'Memoirs', 'A', 'Geisha', 'Munich', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'were', 'two', 'half', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'King', 'Kong', 'Syriana', 'diminished', 'quality', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'included', 'ranking', 'One', 'absolute', 'hands-down', 'favorite', 'movies', 'year', 'History', 'Violence', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'was', '83', 'minutes', 'long', 'had', 'action', 'twists', 'suspense', 'great', 'storytelling', 'one', 'favorites', 'year', 'Shoes', 'was', '133', 'minutes', 'long', 'felt', '90', 'one', 'other', 'movies', 'year', 'loved', 'reason', 'particular', 'reason', 'can', 'distinguish', 'Domino', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'nine', 'minutes', 'felt', 'three', 'hours', 'Producers', 'so', 'briskly', 'paced', 'funny', 'just', 'plain', 'zaney', 'delievery', 'never', 'had', 'asking', 'what', 'time', 'was', 'wanting', 'leave', 'watch', 'video', 'la', 'King', 'Kong', 'movie', 'definetely', 'feel', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'movie', 'risque', 'sexual', 'humor', 'insane', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'most', 'time', 'go', 'ways', 'top', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'hilarious', 'Nazi/playwrite', 'even', 'movie', 'heavily', 'race', 'religion', 'violence', 'comedy', 'later', 'half', 'never', 'racist', 'anti-semetic', 'overly', 'violent', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'onscreen', 'violence']",N/A
638522,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JO24,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 6]","When this brilliant satire of Broadway musicals came out in the sixties it announced two things: (1) enough time has passed so that we can now laugh at the holocaust, and (2) we are OUT.  (Well, not me since I was not only straight, but straight arrow.  But, you know...those other guys.)I remember it well.  The incomparable Mel Brooks not only directed the 1968 production starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, he wrote the script and the music and the lyrics.  As a young man I was not into musicals and certainly not GAY musicals, even if the gay and the musical were making fun of themselves.  But, somehow I liked it.  It was brilliant in a strange way.  It was satire, and I always loved and respected satire.  The music was not perhaps on the same level as Rogers and Hammerstein and the choreography was nothing special as musicals go.  But the show within a show, a classic theatrical device, and the tricky gay jokes within tricky gay jokes were wonderfully done.  Brooks made fun of gay Broadway while at the same time celebrated that Broadway and Hollywood staple: two guys who were not gay (wink, wink) going through a great adventure together.  And it didn't hurt that one was a bit older than the other so that we might see one as a father figure...What a heady time it was.  How free was the artistic and street expression.  These were indeed the sixties when peace guided the planets and love steered the stars, and the closet was a place finally only for ready-to-wear and wire hangers proliferating like bunnies.Oscar Wilde showed in The Importance of Being Ernest that the proper intent for a comedic stage production was to simultaneously flatter and satirize the audience.  The audience is therefore massaged and titillated at the same time.  The secret is to make the satire so subtle that they do not realize consciously they are being satirized.  That was the genius of The Importance and that is the genius of The Producers.In addition to the audience, Brooks satirizes nearly every aspect of the theater.  The producers of course are satirized, but since they are also the stars of the show, that is okay, and real producers would love the script (and perhaps front money for it!).  The Nazis are satirized.  (""Don't be stupid, be a smarty. Come and join the Nazi party."")  Gays are satirized.  (The Indian chief, the sailor, the carpenter, etc. like costumed guys from the popular ""YMCA"" song traipse up and down Roger Debris's staircase.)  Straights are satirized.  Production numbers are satirized.  (You've got to love the choreography of the hundreds of little old ladies in their walkers and their blue and white dresses dancing in the New York streets.)  In short, the mad satirical genius of Mel Brooks finds full flower.This production starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick and directed by Susan Stroman compares favorably with the original; but as usual most people would say the original was better (e.g., check the votes at the Internet Movie Database).  But comparisons are odious, bad manners and certain to offend.  And anyway I need to revisit the original to make a fair comparison.  Regardless this movie is uproarious and provides abundantly the kind of diversion that makes time fly.Nathan Lane, who also reprised Zero Mostel's Pseudolus in the stage production of  ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,"" is hilarious as Max Bialystock, the producer who finances his shows by seducing little old ladies, while Broderick is boyishly cute as Leo Bloom the accountant who wants to be a producer.  The outrageous and very funny plot develops when Bloom comes to do Max's books and remarks that sometimes more money can be made with a flop than a hit.  Max immediately has a brain storm.  He will purposely make a huge flop, and with creative accounting from Leo, they will both make lots of money!  To guarantee success (failure!) they will pick the worse script they can find, hire the worse direction and the worst performers, etc.Needless to say the best laid plans of mice and men often do go astray! as they lament in the song ""Where did we go right?"" (Not performed in this production, but in the original.)  The script they choose is ""Springtime for Hitler,"" penned by a crazed neo-Nazi named Franz Liebkind played extravagantly by Will Farrell.  Uma Thurman plays Ulla the tall dumb blond that Bloom falls in love with.  Thurman is fairly ordinary in the part, but in the scene where Bloom sings, ""That Face"" what the camera emphasizes hilariously and deliciously are her legs, and Uma Thurman does have legs.  An irony (and of course the whole production is replete with ironies) is that a relatively tall actress like Thurman misses out on a lot of parts because she is too tall for the leading man.  Here however part of the fun is had from the fact that she towers over Matthew Broderick.Notable is the performance by Gary Beach as Roger Debris the gay director who steals the show within the movie when he takes the part of Hitler.",5,Tres gay!,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,5004,"['When', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'came', 'out', 'sixties', 'announced', 'two', 'things', '1',

It was great in the play and a chance for Lane to really stretch and strut his stuff. Then I read they planned to add it back in the DVD as one of the extras. They did and it's fabulous - really amazing that it was cut. Another bit that never made it to the movie was in the ""I wanna be a Producer"" scene with the huge room of accountants was the ""I credits all the morning and debits all the evenin' until dem ledgers be right"" solo. It comes back as a brief snip and I have watched it 4 times. Love the tongue in cheek quality and it makes me smile. And the extra where Max AKA Nathan has to make whoopie with all of his backers filmed in NYC's Central Park is another fun to have scene. I am prejudiced - using NYC as backdrop always gets my heart pumping. A real hoot.So, if you saw the movie, you will really enjoy the DVD. If you loved the play, you won't be disappointed with the movie version. There is enough different and with the extras, it's a keeper.Some will say that Uma and Will are mis-cast. Uma maybe (those Marty Feldman eyes, what's up with that?) but Farrell does a good job - he stops the show with the Hitler audition scene.One gripe - Matthew Broderick sleep walks through the movie. Where is Gene Wilder when you need him?  Nathan as Max as Zero Mostel is perfect.

Lane and Broderick were wonderful in the show, as was the rest of the cast. These two, plus Gary Beach and Roger Bart have carried over to the film version, and it seems like they're still playing to the last row of the top balcony of the St. James theater in NYC. And this is a shame, since at least three of them are experienced film actors and know better. While it's fun seeing these four again, I think that this would have been a much better film if someone other than Susan Stroman had directed it and she only recreated the choreography. When you watch the film, the dance and musical numbers look almost exactly like they did on stage. In fact, you can tell that almost all of the sets are actually sets. They don't really look real. There are moments that pay homage to the original film(the fountain going off in Central Park after Leo agrees to the scheme, Ulla going into Sardi's after getting out of a white Rolls Royce). I thought Uma Thurmon did a nice job as Ulle, except when her accent decided to come and go, and Will Farrell was very funny as Franz. In fact, this was one of the few films he's been in that I could tolerate his performance. I wish they had left King of Broadway and the rest of the Springtime for Hitler number in the film, but hopefully they'll be in the deleted scenes on the DVD. This is a fun film and totally un-PC, but it's enjoyable overall and a reminder what the Broadway show is like.The DVD of the film has several gems on it. Fist of all, it includes ""The King of Broadway"", which was edited out of the film and the wonderfully funny intro to ""I Wanna Be a Producer"". The outtakes are a riot, watching Lane and Broderick cracking each other up and often failing to be able to keep a straight face with each other. There are some choice tidbits in Susan Strohman's commentary, like the theater where they filmed the audience watching ""Springtime for Hitler"" is the St. James Theater in NYC, where the show plays on Broadway. And that there are several tributes to Brooks' late wife Anne Bancroft in the film. But on the whole it is one of the most stilted and boring director commentaries I've ever heard. It seems like she's reading from a prepared script instead of giving spontaneous comments on the film and the making of it.

One starts from the knowledge that there is no reproducing a production seen live on film. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses vis-a-vis an audience but neither can produce the same effect in the same way. My guess is that the stars shone before a live audience as they could not do on screen. This is true of myriads of the great Broadway Stars, including, for example, the two Queens of Broadway in their day, Mary Martin and Ethel Merman (the older one). Both had film careers but never become Stars. In  addition, perhaps, the lines came through with a greater sense of spontaneity for the audience. Audience reception can be wonderful in a movie house but it doesn't impact the performer in any way. Waves of approval coming from an audience, the mutual reinforcement members of an audience give each other in their appreciative response, all serve to invigorate the live performers work, he in turn, seeks to stimulate even greater response from the audience who in turn.......Whatever the case may be, taken on its merits, this is a good, old-fashioned musical, reminiscent of the colorful MGM and Fox musicals of the forties and fifties once technicolor became standard. (Paramount, with its great cash cow, Bing Crosby, tended to a different style.) While some of the content would not have passed the censors of that day, little would have had to be cut  from this one to meet those prurient standards. One would guess Broadway, which always had greater latitude in such things, saw a more ribald version.It took me a while to adjust to Lane and Broderick with the memory of the larger than life Zero Mostel and the distinctive Gene Wilder in the original. As the film unwound (an obsolete phrase, of course), I began to appreciate their performances. Both were excellent although Nathan Lane had the better part in which to make an impact.The film seemed to lack the wilder conceptions of the younger Mel Brooks.

638530,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JO24,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 5]","It's difficult for me to be objective about ""The Producers"". The original 1968 film is one of my favorite movie comedies, and I was fortunately enough to see Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick in the smash 2001 Broadway musical version directed by Susan Stroman. She handles this responsibility for the film adaptation, her first time behind the camera, and her lack of experience in the medium shows with the constancy of medium shots and the general staginess of the whole venture. However, this doesn't turn out to be as detrimental as I worried it would be. The more critical aspect of this release is that the stage version has been captured on celluloid.What Stroman does very well is capture Brooks' no-holds-barred comic spirit with this broad-based burlesque revue. She takes an already over-the-top concept and one-ups the original version in hammy schtick and sound decibels. The story is the same with minor tweaks - a larcenous impresario reeling from his latest Broadway failure partners with a by-the-book accountant in a grand scheme to produce a costly flop to reap the write-off in closing the show on its opening night. In a grand recreation, Nathan Lane captures much of the spirit of Zero Mostel in his rimshot-driven portrayal of unscrupulous producer Max Bialystock. He only lacks the fearless desperation that Mostel brought to the role. As nebbish accountant Leo Bloom with a fondness for his blue blanket and a tendency toward uncontrollable tantrums, Matthew Broderick is a game performer but doesn't have that saucer-eyed, slow-burn mensch factor that makes Gene Wilder particularly unique.Also coming back in thoroughly exaggerated turns from the stage version are Gary Beach as flamboyant transvestite director Roger DeBris and Roger Bart as his mincing assistant Carmen Ghia with the snakishly long ssss. Working seamlessly into this ensemble are Will Ferrell, uninhibited and very much at home as always as the old-school Nazi Franz Liebkind, who composes the failed flop in question, ""Springtime for Hitler"", and Uma Thurman, again proving what a sharp comic actress she can be and also quite a singer-dancer as Ulla, the sexy Swedish secretary, with whom Leo falls hopelessly in love. Jon Lovitz even shows up with a comic Lionel Barrymore impression as Leo's stingy boss, Mr. Marks.The production numbers are great fun even if most of the songs are not all that memorable except, of course, for ""Springtime for Hitler"" performed in all its gaudy, tasteless glory. Village People look-alikes show up appropriately for the typically ridiculous ""Keep It Gay"" number, and Stroman wisely opens up the ""Along Comes Bialy"" number to a Central Park setting where a multitude of old-lady investors dance in unison with walkers. However, there are some missed opportunities along the way, at least moments I thought were classic in the stage version - Beach's wonderfully fey Judy Garland tribute at the end of ""Springtime for Hitler"" is lost by having the camera too close, and Lane's showstopper, ""Betrayed"", seems to beg for some sped-up flashbacks to duplicate the blitzkrieg momentum of the song.But there are also wonderful surprises like Thurman's triumphant solo, ""When You Got It, Flaunt It"", and Ferrell's hilarious reprise during the end credits, ""The Hop Clop Goes On"". And please stay in your seat after the credits for the fun free-for-all performed by the entire cast, ""Goodbye!"". If I have one complaint, it may be self-inflicted - since I have seen the original version so many times tirelessly, I just knew what every plot turn would be well before it happened. Regardless, this one is a treat even if it feels like the performers are playing to the back row of the theater.",4,Triumphantly Hilarious Stage Version Arrives Intact Mostly for the Better,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,3716,"['difficult', 'be', 'objective', 'Producers', 'original', '1968', 'film', 'one', 'favorite', 'movie', 'comedies', 'was', 'fortunately', 'enough', 'see', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'smash', '2001', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'version', 'directed', 'Susan', 'Stroman', 'responsibility', 'film', 'adaptation', 'first', 'time', 'camera', 'lack', 'experience', 'medium', 'constancy', 'medium', 'shots', 'general', 'staginess', 'whole', 'venture', 'However', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'detrimental', 'worried', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'critical', 'aspect', 'release', 'stage', 'version', 'been', 'captured', 'Stroman', 'very', 'well', 'capture', 'Brooks', 'no-holds-barred', 'comic', 'spirit', 'broad-based', 'burlesque', 'revue', 'already', 'over-the-top', 'concept', 'one-ups', 'original', 'version', 'hammy', 'schtick', 'sound', 'decibels', 'story', 'same', 'minor', 'tweaks', 'larcenous', 'impresario', 'reeling', 'latest', 'Broadway', 'failure', 'partners', 'by-the-book', 'accountant', 'grand', 'scheme', 'produce', 'costly', 'flop', 'reap', 'write-off', 'closing', 'show', 'opening', 'night', 'grand', 'recreation', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'much', 'spirit', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'rimshot-driven', 'portrayal', 'unscrupulous', 'producer', 'Max', 'Bialystock', 'only', 'fearless', 'desperation', 'Mostel', 'brought', 'role', 'nebbish', 'accountant', 'Leo', 'Bloom', 'fondness', 'blue', 'blanket', 'tendency', 'uncontrollable', 'tantrums', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'game', 'performer', ""n't"", 'have', 'saucer-eyed', 'slow-burn', 'mensch', 'factor', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'particularly', 'unique.Also', 'coming', 'back', 'thoroughly', 'exaggerated', 'turns', 'stage', 'version', 'are', 'Gary', 'Beach', 'flamboyant', 'transvestite', 'director', 'Roger', 'DeBris', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'mincing', 'assistant', 'Carmen', 'Ghia', 'snakishly', 'long', 'ssss', 'Working', 'seamlessly', 'ensemble', 'are', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'uninhibited', 'very', 'much', 'home', 'as', 'always', 'old-school', 'Nazi', 'Franz', 'Liebkind', 'who', 'failed', 'flop', 'question', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'again', 'proving', 'what', 'sharp', 'comic', 'actress', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'quite', 'singer-dancer', 'Ulla', 'sexy', 'Swedish', 'secretary', 'whom', 'Leo', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'even', 'up', 'comic', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'impression', 'Leo', 'stingy', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Marks.The', 'production', 'numbers', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'even', 'most', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'memorable', 'course', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'performed', 'gaudy', 'tasteless', 'glory', 'Village', 'People', 'look-alikes', 'show', 'up', 'appropriately', 'typically', 'ridiculous', 'Keep', 'Gay', 'number', 'Stroman', 'wisely', 'up', 'Along', 'Comes', 'Bialy', 'number', 'Central', 'Park', 'setting', 'where', 'multitude', 'old-lady', 'investors', 'dance', 'unison', 'walkers', 'However', 'are', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'way', 'least', 'moments', 'thought', 'were', 'classic', 'stage', 'version', 'Beach', 'wonderfully', 'fey', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'tribute', 'end', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'lost', 'having', 'camera', 'too', 'close', 'Lane', 'showstopper', 'Betrayed', 'beg', 'sped-up', 'flashbacks', 'duplicate', 'blitzkrieg', 'momentum', 'song.But', 'are', 'also', 'wonderful', 'surprises', 'Thurman', 'triumphant', 'solo', 'When', 'Got', 'Flaunt', 'Ferrell', 'hilarious', 'reprise', 'end', 'Hop', 'Clop', 'Goes', 'please', 'stay', 'seat', 'credits', 'fun', 'free-for-all', 'performed', 'entire', 'cast', 'Goodbye', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'may', 'be', 'self-inflicted', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'version', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'tirelessly', 'just', 'knew', 'what', 'plot', 'turn', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'happened', 'Regardless', 'one', 'treat', 'even', 'performers', 'are', 'playing', 'back', 'row', 'theater']",N/A

It dropped to 2 because it really struggled to earn the .5 mark.I typically don't care for ""remakes"" and because the original is one of my favorite Mel Brooks films, I resisted seeing this until I had the opportunity to purchase a copy for under a dollar.  For that price, I reasoned, it would make a good companion piece to the original.  It does... almost.The directing is, at best, pedestrian.  Most of the time I felt as if I were watching a play that had been filmed.  Maybe that's what was intended.  If you like that directing style then you'll not find a problem.  I don't. I expect movies to have better direction and more camera movement/angles... even movies based on plays/musicals.Matthew Broderick as Leo Bloom was simply terrible!  His performance was wooden, stilted, and only passable in the very few times he appeared to be attempting to channel Gene Wilder.  Maybe this is acceptable for a Broadway play but NOT for a film.  Broderick CAN do better.  I've seen it.Nathan Lane as Max Bialystock almost made up for the poor performance from Broderick.  In fact he was the main reason I made it all the way through the film!  While he is no Zero Mostel, his was the best performance in the film.I normally don't like Will Ferrell at all.  However, here he did a good job as Franz Liebken.  His performance was almost as good as that of Kenneth Mars in the original.  The only problem was almost every time he was on the screen, so too were the awful animatronic pigeons supplied by Jim Henson company.  They were so distractingly bad as to prevent full enjoyment of any scene in which they were to be found!Uma Thurmon was a suprise.  Very nice performance.While I did miss Dick Shawn as hippie-freak Lorenzo S. Dubois, the updated take on the director, Roger De Bris, taking over the lead after Franz had broken his leg was done well enough that it really was a minor blip on the radar.  Overall an excellent change and good update for the times.There were several scenes I really missed.  Most notably the one where Leo and Max had gone to the corner bar to celebrate their failure when in comes the crowd raving about how funny it all was and how they can't wait for the second act!  In the remake, the very redundant, very long, very boring musical number in the cell where Max recounts the ENTIRE play could have been dropped to allow this scene (and others) to remain.  At least most of it is on the deleted scenes portion of the release.  This leads to perhaps the most glaring problem.  The making of this script into a musical.  The musical numbers were too frequent and too long causing the timing of the plot to suffer making for a longer production than necessary.As in the original, the play-within-a-play ""Springtime for Hitler"" steals the show!  While Mel Brooks was not on-screen this time as one of the Nazis delivering a one-liner, he *did* do the voice for the line!Overall this *is* a funny film with several laugh-out-loud moments!  It's Mel Brooks after all... The problem is that the directing and one very bad performance almost kill the funny.If you are looking for a fair reproduction of the Broadway Musical, I get the impression that you'll get exactly that with this film even though several musical numbers were cut.If you are looking for Mel Brooks... I encorage you to pick up the original.  It's a superiour film in almost every respect.And if you are one of those who stops a film (or leaves the theatre) as soon as the credits roll... don't this time and you'll be rewarded.",2,Should have been better.,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,3576,"['OK', 'really', '2.5', 'stars', 'not', 'possible', 'dropped', '2', 'really', 'struggled', 'earn', '.5', 'mark.I', 'typically', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'remakes', 'original', 'one', 'favorite', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'films', 'resisted', 'seeing', 'had', 'opportunity', 'purchase', 'copy', 'dollar', 'price', 'reasoned', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'companion', 'piece', 'original', 'almost.The', 'directing', 'best', 'pedestrian', 'Most', 'time', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'play', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'Maybe', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'like', 'directing', 'style', 'then', ""'ll"", 'not', 'find', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movies', 'have', 'better', 'direction', 'more', 'camera', 'movement/angles', 'even', 'movies', 'based', 'plays/musicals.Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Leo', 'Bloom', 'was', 'simply', 'terrible', 'performance', 'was', 'wooden', 'stilted', 'only', 'passable', 'very', 'few', 'times', 'appeared', 'be', 'attempting', 'channel', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Maybe', 'acceptable', 'Broadway', 'play', 'NOT', 'film', 'Broderick', 'CAN', 'do', 'better', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'it.Nathan', 'Lane', 'Max', 'Bialystock', 'almost', 'made', 'up', 'poor', 'performance', 'Broderick', 'fact', 'was', 'main', 'reason', 'made', 'way', 'film', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'was', 'best', 'performance', 'film.I', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'However', 'here', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Franz', 'Liebken', 'performance', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Kenneth', 'Mars', 'original', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'almost', 'time', 'was', 'screen', 'so', 'too', 'were', 'awful', 'animatronic', 'pigeons', 'supplied', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'company', 'were', 'so', 'distractingly', 'bad', 'prevent', 'full', 'enjoyment', 'scene', 'were', 'be', 'found', 'Uma', 'Thurmon', 'was', 'suprise', 'Very', 'nice', 'performance.While', 'did', 'miss', 'Dick', 'Shawn', 'hippie-freak', 'Lorenzo', 'S.', 'Dubois', 'updated', 'take', 'director', 'Roger', 'De', 'Bris', 'taking', 'over', 'lead', 'Franz', 'had', 'broken', 'leg', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'really', 'was', 'minor', 'blip', 'radar', 'excellent', 'change', 'good', 'update', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'really', 'missed', 'Most', 'notably', 'one', 'where', 'Leo', 'Max', 'had', 'gone', 'corner', 'bar', 'celebrate', 'failure', 'when', 'crowd', 'raving', 'how', 'funny', 'was', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'second', 'act', 'remake', 'very', 'redundant', 'very', 'long', 'very', 'boring', 'musical', 'number', 'cell', 'where', 'Max', 'ENTIRE', 'play', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'allow', 'scene', 'others', 'remain', 'least', 'most', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'portion', 'release', 'perhaps', 'most', 'glaring', 'problem', 'making', 'script', 'musical', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'too', 'frequent', 'too', 'long', 'causing', 'timing', 'plot', 'suffer', 'making', 'longer', 'production', 'necessary.As', 'original', 'play-within-a-play', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'show', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'was', 'not', 'on-screen', 'time', 'one', 'Nazis', 'delivering', 'one-liner', 'do', 'voice', 'line', 'funny', 'film', 'several', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'problem', 'directing', 'one', 'very', 'bad', 'performance', 'almost', 'kill', 'funny.If', 'are', 'looking', 'fair', 'reproduction', 'Broadway', 'Musical', 'get', 'impression', ""'ll"", 'get', 'exactly', 'film', 'even', 'several', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'cut.If', 'are', 'looking', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'encorage', 'pick', 'up', 'original', 'superiour', 'film', 'almost', 'respect.And', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'stops', 'film', 'theatre', 'as', 'soon', 'credits', 'roll', 'do', ""n't"", 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded']",N/A
638540,A19JYLHD94K94D,B00005JO24,Itamar Katz,"[5, 5]","Do keep in mind that The Producers is a film based on a stage musical based on a film about a stage musical. The story lost some layers of color in the transformation process. The movie certainly isn't anywhere near as powerful and inspired as the 1968 original; and it all too often feels like a filmed stage play. That is, the script and the songs are terrific, and it seems like it ought to be a truly wonderful theatre experience (one that I regret not seeing), but Susan Stroman's direction doesn't go the extra mile to make the film a unique and separate experience that makes the cinematic version worthwhile, in the way of truly great musical to film adaptations - Cabaret, Chicago and the Rocky Horror Picture Show come to mind, as well as the often overlooked Hedwig and the Angry Inch - that took, in different ways, a fresh take on the source material that made the film an independent creation. The Producers is more on the level of films like Rent, which bring the play to a bigger crowd but don't really make any new statement.And now that I've said all that I feel hypocritical, because I actually enjoyed The Producers thoroughly and immensely, start to finish. Because it really is lots of fun. The sarcasm of the original film lost little of its edge, and the musical adaptation is terrific, and does honor to Mel Brooks's brilliant original vision. The musical-within-a-musical, which I thought at first might get confusing and unconvincing, actually works remarkably well, and it's very self-aware, with a lot of cynical in-jokes about Broadway and the world of musical theatre. As I said, it's as cynical and dark as the original film, and Brooks avoided the pressure to make it kitschy and happy; any Broadway-style cheesiness there may be in it is self-aware and sarcastic.The cast has its problems, but not too many. Nathan Lane is a terrific Bialystock, every bit as memorable as Zero Mostel's timeless original character. Matthew Broderick isn't nearly as good as Gene Wilder, who was and remains the one and only Leo Bloom, but he gets the job done, and does well on the musical numbers. Gary Beach and Roger Bart are terrific, but I had a problem with Uma Thurman as Ulla, the only cast member not to play the same part on stage; she didn't really deliver with her singing and dancing, and her accent fades in and out throughout. Ulla's scenes were probably the weakest part of the film, and her part in the story was extended far beyond the one she had in the 1968 film, probably because that film didn't have any female lead at all. The real surprise here is Will Ferrell - one of my least favorite comedians - who is absolutely side-splittingly spectacular as Franz Liebkind. I regret the loss of Lorenzo St. Dubois AKA L.S.D, but his omission was probably for the best, because the character wouldn't be nearly as relevant or funny today as it was in 1968.Another word of praise for the musical numbers, lyrics by Mel Brooks and music by Thomas Meehan (who also wrote Annie). The best of these are still the Springtime For Hitler segments, which were taken - music, lyrics, choreography - directly for the original film, and are still brilliant. But there are other showstoppers, such as ""Der Guten Tag Hop Clop"", ""Keep It Gay"" and ""Opening Night"". Uma being the exception, all the actors do a spectacular job on the songs, all the time making you wish you were seeing this on stage. Still, if you missed that chance, The Producers is a great watch. Not better than the 1968 film, but a very good musical film and a hilarious comedy.",4,Mixed feelings on The Producers,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,3566,"['Do', 'keep', 'mind', 'Producers', 'film', 'based', 'stage', 'musical', 'based', 'film', 'stage', 'musical', 'story', 'lost', 'layers', 'color', 'transformation', 'process', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'powerful', 'inspired', '1968', 'original', 'too', 'often', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'script', 'songs', 'are', 'terrific', 'ought', 'be', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'theatre', 'experience', 'one', 'regret', 'not', 'seeing', 'Susan', 'Stroman', 'direction', ""n't"", 'go', 'extra', 'mile', 'make', 'film', 'unique', 'separate', 'experience', 'cinematic', 'version', 'worthwhile', 'way', 'truly', 'great', 'musical', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Cabaret', 'Chicago', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'come', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'often', 'overlooked', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'took', 'different', 'ways', 'fresh', 'take', 'source', 'material', 'made', 'film', 'independent', 'creation', 'Producers', 'more', 'level', 'films', 'Rent', 'bring', 'play', 'bigger', 'crowd', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'new', 'statement.And', 'now', ""'ve"", 'said', 'feel', 'hypocritical', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'Producers', 'thoroughly', 'immensely', 'start', 'finish', 'really', 'lots', 'fun', 'sarcasm', 'original', 'film', 'lost', 'little', 'edge', 'musical', 'adaptation', 'terrific', 'honor', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'brilliant', 'original', 'vision', 'musical-within-a-musical', 'thought', 'first', 'might', 'get', 'confusing', 'unconvincing', 'actually', 'remarkably', 'well', 'very', 'self-aware', 'lot', 'cynical', 'in-jokes', 'Broadway', 'world', 'musical', 'theatre', 'said', 'as', 'cynical', 'dark', 'original', 'film', 'Brooks', 'avoided', 'pressure', 'make', 'kitschy', 'happy', 'Broadway-style', 'cheesiness', 'may', 'be', 'self-aware', 'sarcastic.The', 'cast', 'problems', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'terrific', 'Bialystock', 'bit', 'as', 'memorable', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'timeless', 'original', 'character', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'Leo', 'Bloom', 'job', 'done', 'well', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Gary', 'Beach', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'are', 'terrific', 'had', 'problem', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Ulla', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'not', 'play', 'same', 'part', 'stage', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'deliver', 'singing', 'dancing', 'accent', 'fades', 'Ulla', 'scenes', 'were', 'probably', 'weakest', 'part', 'film', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'extended', 'far', 'one', 'had', '1968', 'film', 'probably', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'female', 'lead', 'real', 'surprise', 'here', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'comedians', 'who', 'absolutely', 'side-splittingly', 'spectacular', 'Franz', 'Liebkind', 'regret', 'loss', 'Lorenzo', 'St.', 'Dubois', 'AKA', 'L.S.D', 'omission', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'relevant', 'funny', 'today', 'was', '1968.Another', 'word', 'praise', 'musical', 'numbers', 'lyrics', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'music', 'Thomas', 'Meehan', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Annie', 'best', 'are', 'still', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'segments', 'were', 'taken', 'music', 'lyrics', 'choreography', 'directly', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'brilliant', 'are', 'other', 'showstoppers', 'such', 'Der', 'Guten', 'Tag', 'Hop', 'Clop', 'Keep', 'Gay', 'Opening', 'Night', 'Uma', 'being', 'exception', 'actors', 'do', 'spectacular', 'job', 'songs', 'time', 'making', 'wish', 'were', 'seeing', 'stage', 'Still', 'missed', 'chance', 'Producers', 'great', 'watch', 'Not', 'better', '1968', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'musical', 'film', 'hilarious', 'comedy']",N/A

Some parts are verbatim, and other parts are new material.  If you like musicals then you will rate this production higher than I did.Those who saw the original movie will recall the audience reaction during the opening scene of Springtime for Hitler.  Open mouth disgust!  I experienced the same open mouth horror watching the opening scene in Bialystock's office.  Matthew Brodericks acting was terrible.  He was dry and wooden - not even close to Gene Wilder's fantastic performance.Nathan Lane however, was excellent as Bialystock.  Indeed, I think he could have replaced Zero in the original and it still would have come off as a great movie, even without Zero's bug eyes and booming voice.Some of the other character actors and scenes in this production are better than the original.  Will Ferrell as Franz Liebkind was a good as Kenneth Mars, but with different scenes and dialog.  The actors Gary Beach as the director, and Roger Bart as his assistant, were much better cast than the original.  Some of their scenes will have you roaring with laughter.As Mel Brooks movies go, the original with Zero and Wilder is 5+ stars.  This movie is tough to rate, but I will give it 3 stars.  Nathan Lane's performance, some new material, and the added bonus and outtakes make the disk worth having.

It's certainly a fun film, with a number of very good songs, a great performance by Nathan Lane, and a good one by Maththew Broderick.But, it falls short of the original in several areas. The biggest is probably in the character of Leo Bloom. Broderick's performance, while often good, just isn't up to Gene Wilder's manic insananity. Just contrast the scene where Bloom tries to hold onto his blanket. Broderick seems forced; Wilder seems truly nuts (and is much funnier).  (To be fair, perhaps the reality is that Broderick's performance is stagier. There are styles of acting that work very well on stage but don't work as well on screen and vice versa.)And of course the original Dick Shawn's brilliant performance as over the top actor L.S.D., playing Hitler.

I kept hearing how wonderful the new version was and how great Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane were in these roles, so finally gave this movie a try.  I figured it must be getting rave reviews for some reason, so watched it yesterday.  In all honesty, I cannot understand why so many people think this thing is ""hilarious"".  Personally, I thought it was dreadful.For one thing, it seemed forced and contrived.  It just wasn't funny at all.  I thought Matthew Broderick was particularly awful and miscast as Leo Bloom.  He doesn't hold a candle to Gene Wilder's portrayal.  I always liked Broderick as Ferris Bueller, but as I've seen him in other movies since then I've come to realize that he really is not a very good actor.  He comes across as wooden and slightly self-conscious in practically everything and this movie is no exception.  Personally, he was painful to watch.As for Nathan Lane, I guess he was O.K.  He was slightly better than Broderick, but still seemed forced as well.  Uma Thurman was also a disappointment with her Swedish accent constantly slipping.Overall, I really did not like this version.  If you haven't seen either the old or new ""Producers"", I strongly recommend sticking with the oldie-but-goodie original movie.

Susan Stohman directs this adaption of the Broadway musical which she also directed and she retains some of the major cast from the Broadway show.  Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane return as Leo Bloom and Max Bialystock, an accountant and a once famous but now failed producer seeking to strike it rich by making the biggest flop in Broadway history.  Bialystock and Bloom hook up when Bloom is sent to do Bialystock's books and sees how it would be possible to actually make more money from a failed production than from a hit.Bialystock and Bloom search for the worst play ever written, the worst director and the worst actors.  The play they come across is titled ""Springtime for Hitler"" and it is a celebration of the Third Reich.  Their assumption is that not only will this show close in a single day, the show might not make it to intermission.  There is something to offend absolutely everyone.This is the story of Mel Brooks' original film, the musical, and now the movie adaption of the musical.  It worked and was funny with Gene Wilder and I've seen the show in the Twin Cities, and it worked as a musical.  Does it work as a movie musical?  Yes it does, but it plays very theatrically.  Very.  Acting that veers over the top by both Broderick and Lane that had my wife and I looking at each other in the theatre asking if this is for real would probably play very differently with live actors on the stage.  And yet even the moments of absurdity still work and the bottom line is that the movie is fun and it is funny.The entire movie/story is an exercise in absurdity what with the attempt to put on the worst play ever and make money out of the deal.  There are sequences that come to mind such as the ""unhappy"" musical number by the accountants, and everything with the German writer of ""Springtime for Hitler"".  This former Nazi is played by Will Ferrell, an actor whom I have not always appreciated, but who turns in what I consider the scene stealing role of the film as I laughed the most with Ferrell on screen and especially his Nazi saluting pigeons.The theatricality of the film is something that a viewer will either able to accept and enjoy the movie, or it will be a big turn off.  I was able to work with it and enjoy the movie even as it played like a theatre musical on stage (at times with the pause at the end of a musical number).  Strohman plays this to great effect,  however, and it becomes part of the charm of the movie.  By no means is ""The Producers"" perfect (though there was a man in the audience who apparently thought this was the funniest thing he had ever seen), but it is very well made.  The only thing that truly threw me was Uma Thurman as Oola.  I kept hearing her slip out of her accent, but my wife did not notice this at all.  I would have loved to have seen the woman who won a Tony Award for playing this same role with Broderick and Lane on Broadway.  I'm not quite sure why she had to be replaced. But this is only a small bit of irksomeness in a good movie.As this was the first movie I had been able to see in theatres in months and I had a fantastic time, and I think that is something a movie should deliver: enjoyment.

When I finally saw it, it was with Brad Oscar who did a credible job as Bialystock. I saw it once more in a Broadway Across America road show with Lewis J. Stadlen which was very well done, but I had to see it with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. When they went back into the show for a limited run, each receiving one hundred thousand a week, I had to see it. I paid five hundred dollars for a prime third row seat, and it was worth it. They made the show. Both were sensational.In this DVD movie version both are reprising their roles and Susan Stroman is again the director as on Broadway. Unfortunately a Broadway director and a Hollywood director are worlds apart. She tried to open up the show with external shots, but it seemed constantly like a staged version, clumsy, corny, and artificial. When a number finished, there was even a pause for the applause. She could not shake the proscenium arch and the black box of the theater. She's a brilliant live theater director, and a clueless movie director. And talk about product placement: there is a long, long scene in front of a Sardi's sign that is blatantly exploitive.Lane and Broderick try mightily, but they just do not come over as well as they do on the stage. Will Ferrell was added to the cast as the movie, and he does a great job, but the movie needed a strong directorial hand not added Hollywood names. The recent movie ""Hairspray"" was a movie-movie and actually is better than the play. The director of the movie ""Chicago"" did a brilliant job, reinventing the stage play as a movie.

The songs are toe tappers for the most part, the expansion of the parts of the director and the author of ""Springtime for Hitler"" were welcome as was the expanded role of the Swedish bombshell.Mel Brooks zany mind works as well on stage as in the movies and this is a DVD you really want to have in your archives.PS: The out takes included with the DVD are hilarious and there is a section where the director comments throughout the movie on various aspects of what you are watching, giving inside tidbits about the scenes and the filming, which by themselves are worth the price of the DVD.",4,Even Better with Music,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,1346,"['have', 'been', 'longtime', 'fan', 'original', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'movie', 'starring', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'was', 'interest', 'went', 'see', 'summer', 'stock', 'version', 'Broadway', 'show', 'here', 'Maine', 'was', 'Ogunquit', 'PLayhouse', 'two', 'leads', 'had', 'been', 'road', 'show', 'versions', 'play', 'were', 'outstanding', 'was', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'total', 'hoot.Out', 'interest', 'decided', 'purchase', 'movie', 'version', 'Broadway', 'show', 'compare', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'hard', 'top', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'anything', 'whole', 'preferred', 'seeing', 'play', 'rather', 'movie', 'same.That', 'being', 'said', 'play', 'entertaining', 'time', 'can', 'spend', 'theater', 'thought', 'was', 'improvement', 'original', 'movie', 'songs', 'are', 'toe', 'tappers', 'most', 'part', 'expansion', 'parts', 'director', 'author', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'were', 'welcome', 'was', 'expanded', 'role', 'Swedish', 'bombshell.Mel', 'Brooks', 'zany', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'stage', 'movies', 'DVD', 'really', 'want', 'have', 'archives.PS', 'out', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'hilarious', 'section', 'where', 'director', 'comments', 'movie', 'various', 'aspects', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'giving', 'tidbits', 'scenes', 'filming', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD']",N/A

Fundamentally, if you like any one of them you would probably like them all.  Moreover, if you like musicals in general this one shines above most of them.  The songs are timeless and ""cultureless"" in a way that other musicals, which use contemporary rock, jazz, etc. are not.As for the 2005 film, it is an excellent rendition of the stage version.  There are differences, including:-Removing the song ""Where did we go right?""-Minor plot changes-A very ""gay"" Hitler, which is much more in the spirit of the original film compared to the stage production-Old lady dance is a bit shorter-Springtime for Hitler dance seemed MUCH shorter-And of course, a lot more changes in scenesObviously, there is a lot to be said for stage productions - the skill of the dancers, actors, and singers; the varying sets; and the overall atmosphere.  Nonetheless, most of this is retained in the film and cinema audiences laughed almost as much as in the theatre.  The biggest difference, of course, is cost of admission.  So we should be VERY thankful that Mel Brooks was willing to let his continuously profitable and sold-out show go to the big screen.I thought Matthew Broderick's expressions in the film were a bit exaggerated too often; this is necessary for the stage but for film, with close-ups and all, it can get tiring.  Nathan Lane was fantastic.  Uma Thurman was fine; though I'm not sure that the role was especially difficult.

But it can be a lot of fun anyway by using the idea of the play and putting it into music and dance.  That's what musicals are all about.  Music and dance adapted from stories or plays.  If you loved the play you probably won't like the musical.  But if you can separate the play from the musical, and just concentrate on the theme and the idiotic story line, you'll have a good time.I didn't get to see the musical on stage, but I did see the recording session on PBS before the movie and DVD of the musical came out.  There, in the recording studio where the original cast recorded the musical (even the tap dancing) I got the idea of what I was going to see when the musical did come out. All the songs were there, the orchestra, original cast, including some unrehearsed, hilarious wordplay with Mel and the cast while he and Susan Stroman directed the recording.  I almost liked the PBS recording version better than the show.  Watching this 85-minute documentary was an enlightening and entertaining companion to the film and/or DVD.I became familiar with the songs from watching the recording session, which I loved.  It was so up and so funny. The characters had a sense of humor, and the only thing rehearsed was the musical numbers. When I finally saw the film and got the DVD of the musical, I was already familiar with all the songs, so it wasn't as though I was seeing it for the first time.  But I still laughed at the storyline.  I did find myself comparing Uma Thurman to the gal who played her part in the stage production and the recording, and discovered that while Uma was fine as the Swedish secretary, she just couldn't sing.  The gal in the recording session, Cady Huffman was absolutely, absolutely great!  What a voice! The other characters in the recording session were the same as in the film.  Great.Despite some silly flaws in the film, I really found I was smiling or laughing and singing along during the whole time I watched the DVD, and if something can make me smile or laugh for 2 hours, as this film did, then whose to complain?  I'm sorry I didn't see it on stage, but I didn't have tickets and I don't live in NY or CA or anywhere else the show played.

Even the way he reads his lines echo Mr. Mostel.  But the real problem here rests squarely on Broderick's fey shoulders.

Brooks has never been subtle, but surely he and the director are aware that there is a marked difference between stage acting - where one must project - and film acting - where less is sometimes sufficient.  The camera catches every nuance, but nuance is what this film lacks.  It lacks a film sensibility.  It wants to choke one into submission - &#34;You'll enjoy this number or else&#34;!

Now, 30 years later, Brooks has updated the movie for his first ever Broadway Musical. While I have not seen the show, I own the soundtrack and the DVD: Recording The Producers and I must say that it's one of the most hysterical things I have ever heard.Who else but Mel Brooks can come up with the idea that if you ""mess with the books"" you can become rich? The idea itself is genius but it only works through Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick the only two people who could play these characters.Lucky for us, they agreed to appear in the movie version which, if you've seen the show on Broadway, is exactly the same with a few differences.One of the most funny bits in the film is with the song: Springtime for Hitler in which a gay Hitler goes off on a romp about WWII. Keep in mind, Mel Brooks, a Jew, went through the war and the fact that he's making fun of Hitler, albeit making him gay, is jilarious unto itself. Imagine what would have been if he really was gay. Another song that stands out, is Prisoners of Love where Max and Leo get released because the judge says all inmates have been rehabilitated through dance and song. Unrealistic? Yes but hysterical.There's one line in the film that will make you laugh like you never have before said by Hanz Libkind, played in the film by a perfectly cast Will Ferrell, who says with a gun pointing at Max and Leo, "" This is for making a fool out of Hitler.""

638577,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JO24,Mark Baker,"[3, 6]","Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) is a down on his luck producer who hasn't had a Broadway hit in years.  In fact, they've made a special sign for him so that they can flip it over and turn opening night into closing night with hardly any effort.After his latest show collapses, accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) comes to Max's office/apartment to go over the books.  In an off handed comment, Leo mentions that a great way to make money would be to put on a guaranteed flop, raise lots of money, and they keep the difference.  Max immediately jumps on the idea, but Leo wants no part in the criminal plan.  Eventually, however, Leo's desire to be a Broadway producer gets the better of him, and he partners with Max.The two are certain they've found the perfect piece when they read ""Springtime for Hitler,"" a piece that makes the evil dictator out to be a nice guy.  Getting the Nazi loving author (Will Ferrell) on board is a bit of a challenge, as is signing Roger De Bris (Gary Beach), the worst director in town, and his male harem.  Now they just need to sit back, relax, and watch the money roll in.  Right?I should have known what I was getting into before I saw this movie.  It is a Mel Brooks story, and he seems to go for the sex joke any chance he gets.  I was tired of them long before the movie reached the half way point.  Some scenes also went on way after the last sexual joke had been milked from the situation.The story itself is very entertaining.  I never could decide if I wanted Max and Leo to be caught or get away with their crime.  There were lots of scenes I found amusing, but I was rolling at the scene near the end where everyone reacts to the play's opening night.The actors all do amazing jobs with the rolls.  Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick originated their rolls when the story became a Broadway musical, and their familiarity with the material is an asset.  Will Ferrell, not part of the Broadway cast, is hilarious as the politically motivated author.  He steals most every scene he is in.  Uma Thurman is simply amazing as Ulla, the secretary/starlet/Leo's girlfriend.  I had no clue who was playing her until the credits.The songs in this musical are fun, but there is nothing here particularly catchy.  I didn't find myself leaving the theater humming anything, and there was nothing special that caught my ear that made me want to go out and buy the soundtrack.Susan Stroman, who did the choreography for the Broadway version, directs the movie.  She also did the choreography here.  And there in lies the problem.  While a few of the numbers near the beginning show some creativity, most of them fall into the stage trap.  They look like a dance routine created for the stage version of the show but filmed for the big screen.  Of course, not every song needs to involve many locations, but this film began to become trapped by its sets in the second half, and an inventive musical number would have gone a long way toward saving it.Even leaving my distaste for much of the humor aside, this movie falls short of what it could have been.  A little more creativity could have made this movie rise to the level of the performances the actors gave.",3,Stop the World.

The film version of ""The Producers"" does an excellent job of bringing the Mel Brooks musical to the big screen. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their roles as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, two men who set out to produce the worst flop in Broadway history and make off with two million dollars of their investors' money. Max and Leo settle on an outrageous and offensive show titled ""Springtime for Hitler,"" which is every bit as atrocious as you would expect it to be...and then some!Susan Stroman directed and choreographed the film (she was also the director and choreographer of the Broadway show). Lane and Broderick have amazing chemistry and give outstanding performances. There are some fantastic new additions to the cast, including Will Ferrell as an author with a Nazi fetish and Uma Thurman as Swedish actress/secretary/sex kitten.I cannot say enough good things about this movie. The audience laughed for two hours straight. It's hilarious, over-the-top, and absolutely fabulous in every way. (Be sure to sit through all the credits to hear Ferrell sing a little Nazi lullaby and see a special bit at the very end that includes a Mel Brooks cameo.)Now I'll leave you with a few memorable lines from the show within the show:""Springtime for Hitler and Germany.Deutschland is happy and gay!We're marching to a faster paceLook out, here comes the master race!""",5,"""Heil myself, heil to me!""",1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,1435,"['exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'musical', 'supposed', 'be', 'film', 'version', 'Producers', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'musical', 'big', 'screen', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'reprise', 'roles', 'Max', 'Bialystock', 'Leo', 'Bloom', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'produce', 'worst', 'flop', 'Broadway', 'history', 'make', 'off', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'investors', 'money', 'Max', 'Leo', 'settle', 'outrageous', 'offensive', 'show', 'titled', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'bit', 'as', 'atrocious', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'then', 'Susan', 'Stroman', 'directed', 'choreographed', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'director', 'choreographer', 'Broadway', 'show', 'Lane', 'Broderick', 'have', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'are', 'fantastic', 'new', 'additions', 'cast', 'including', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'author', 'Nazi', 'fetish', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Swedish', 'kitten.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'audience', 'laughed', 'two', 'hours', 'straight', 'hilarious', 'over-the-top', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'way', 'Be', 'sure', 'sit', 'credits', 'hear', 'Ferrell', 'sing', 'little', 'Nazi', 'lullaby', 'see', 'special', 'bit', 'very', 'end', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'cameo', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'few', 'memorable', 'lines', 'show', 'show', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'Germany.Deutschland', 'happy', 'gay', ""'re"", 'marching', 'faster', 'paceLook', 'out', 'here', 'master', 'race']",N/A
638582,A1UYNO24EXETXE,B00005JO24,M. G ORELL,"[2, 2]","Riding fast on the heels of Rent, The Producers is yet another nail off the coffin of movie musicals. The hit Broadway show has been beautifully transferred to the screen. Is it stagey? Yes? Wonderfully stagey. The staginess of the movie brings to mind how they did movie musicals back in the days of Singin' in the Rain and An American in Paris, thus making the loving homage to the Golden Age of Broadway a loving homage to the Golden Age of MGM movie musicals, even though Universal and Columbia produced it.I had the pleasure of seeing the entire original cast in February of 2002. Well, for half the show, anyway. Cady Huffman, the original Ulla, left during intermission as did Eric Gunhus, the original Lead Stormtrooper Tenor. Dammit!Recreating their roles from the Broadway show, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are excellent as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom (respectively) the former King of Broadway and nerdy accountant (again, respectively) out to find the worst play ever written and make off with 2 million dollars. Nathan Lane, who won the Tony for this excellent performance, still pulls punches. I felt that this was an Oscar-worthy performance. Matthew Broderick is also amazing in the Tony-nominated role that he lost to Nathan Lane. But it does not matter as the Tony might as well have been for both of them. However, I think Nathan deserved his own Oscar.As the nutty neo-Nazi playwright who writes the supposedly worst play ever written, Will Ferrell, in the style of Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms of Rent, blends into the cast as if he has always played the role originated by Brad Oscar, who was nominated for a Tony for this role. As a side note, Brad Oscar makes a quick cameo as a cab driver. This was another performance worthy of Oscar gold.Uma Thurman brings the neccessary sexiness of Ulla, the sexy Swedish secretary. However, her singing...well, she could have used a bit more training. She says, ""Now Ulla belt"" in her big showstopper, ""When You Got It, Flaunt It"". That is not belting. I could hit those notes. But her performance is but a mere scratch on this gem.As the worst director in town, Gary Beach hams it up wonderfully as Roger DeBris, the unbelievably gay theatre director who thinks everything should be gay (happy gay, that is). He won the Tony for this role and you can see why. As a side note, in the red wig, he looks like a friend of my mom's. As his ""common law assistant"", Tony-winner Roger Bart is hilarious as Carmen Ghia, for which he was nominated for a Tony.Filled to the brim with cameos from Broadway's brightest as well as hilarious cameos by Jon Lovitz as Leo Bloom's tyrannical boss, Mr. Marks and Duplex's Eileen Essel as Hold Me-Touch Me, a little old lady who is one of Max's backers and won't hand over the check until they play ""one dirty little game"", The Producers shines with magical musical numbers, particularly ""I Wanna Be A Producer"" which brings to mind the Broadway Melody sequence of Singin' in the Rain or the American in Paris Ballet. Any numbers that come off as very stagy, particularly Max's ""Betrayed"" number, are compensated by the actor's performance which makes the number all the more pleasing to watch.The deleted scenes are excellent and should provide closure to those wondering, ""What the hell happened to ""King of Broadway""?"". I was especially happy to see this number in the film as well as ""In Old Bavaria"", the reprise of ""Der Guten Tag Hop Clop"", as well as the solo by the black accountant in ""I Wanna Be A Producer."" Susan Stroman's audio commentary sounds like she viewed a cut of the film and wrote everything down before hand. I would have liked it better if she was joined or if there was a separate commentary track by Mel Brooks, as well as a better Behind-the-Scenes documentary. Just a measly Analysis of a Scene featurette. Gimme a break.But this is an excellent movie for musical theatre lovers.

Nathan Lane is superb in recreating his role of Max Bialystock, the lecherous producer who'll do anything to round up backers for his shows, which are always flops.  Matthew Broderick reprises his role, too, but I didn't find him as effective as I would have liked.  With a pleasing singing voice and capable dancing abilities, he seems to give his all for the role, but his performance vacillates between monotone and unconvincing hysterical scenes.  Uma Thurman who does well in the role of the Swedish Ulla seems a strange choice for a role in which all of her dancing segments were done by a stand-in.  Why not get a real singer/dancer--box office concerns maybe?  The flamboyant Will Farrell chews up the scenery as the play's Hitler-adoring writer, and although he's his usual zany self, it fits the movie.  The songs themselves are forgettable, and the movie seems to be flat until the delightful Gary Beach and Roger Bart zoom in as the hilarious homesexual director and his aide.  Their energy brings a lot of life to the movie, and I found them to be the most entertaining performers in the film.

I went to see the show and enjoyed it quite alot when it was here in Melbourne.After enjoying the stage show, I bought the original Producers video, and saw how much of a difference there was. However, i liked the stage show more. And when I saw the previews to the movie of it, I had to go right away.Unfortunatly, I gotta say, the first 10 mins where uncomfortable, I couldnt get into Matt Brodricks acting style for his charactor Leo Bloom. As the film went on, i dont know if got more bareable and I got used to it, or if it got a little better... but I thought the whole cast was pretty good... except Will Farells first 5 mins... but liek Matts perfromance I guess I got used to it. Maybe I was comparing it to Moonfaces portrayel too much.So the movies about a producer and his accountant who discover they could make more money with a flop then a hit Broadway show. So they hire the worst director, worst actors and intend to keep the money for themselves. But things go wrong on opening night and they end up in a pickle.It was OK, but i'd rather have watched the stage show on the screen instead.

He has an accountant named Leo Bloom, played by Matthew Broderick (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Election) who says that Max can make more money making a flop then a hit, so Max takes this into consideration as they 2 get lots of scripts to find the worst play ever written and they find it in a script called ""Springtime For Hitler"" which was written by Franz Liebkind, played overthetop by Will Ferrell (Old School, Wedding Crashers). The 2 Producers even get a new assistant named Ulla, played by the vuluptuous and sexy Uma Thurman (Kill Bill 1 & 2, Jennifer 8). When the play hits, the 2 Producers find themselves in a heap of trouble when the play becomes an actual hit which means jailtime. This play turned movie/comedy/musical doesnt have the oomph and it should've just stayed there...on broadway. The 2 lead actors do there damn best...they have chemistry as a duo but it probably has more spark on stage then on movie. Lane had the best moments because he's flipping hilarious. The songs can be taken in by small amounts and the best one would be ""If You Got It, Flaunt It"" when Thurman does her thing.

638588,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JO24,Miles D. Moore,"[2, 3]","Susan Stroman's musical film of ""The Producers"" isn't quite the crazed masterpiece that Mel Brooks' original movie was. In places it's painfully obvious that Stroman--an ace theatrical director and choreographer who performed both chores for the Broadway musical--hasn't the slightest idea what to do with a movie camera other than bolt it to the soundstage. That said, her version of ""The Producers"" still provides more than enough laughter, joy and high spirits to satisfy any audience looking for a good time at the movies. It must be admitted that Mel Brooks--except for the wacky ""Gutentag Hop-Clop"" and of course the sublime ""Springtime for Hitler""--is a serviceable songwriter at best. But his screenplay (co-written with ""Annie"" scripter Thomas Meehan, who also collaborated on the Broadway version of ""Producers"") shows him still at the height of his powers as a gagmeister. Mel judiciously cut characters from the original who had become dated (notably Lorenzo St. DuBois, a/k/a L.S.D.) while expanding the musical-ready roles of Ulla, Roger DeBris and Carmen Ghia. (Broadway originals Gary Beach and Roger Bart are roll-in-the-aisles funny as Roger and Carmen, while Uma Thurman is a knockout as Ulla, a vastly better singer, dancer and comedienne than one might expect.) As the pixilated playwright (or is that playwrong?) Franz Liebkind, Will Ferrell equals Kenneth Mars from the original movie, bringing a joyous heedlessness all his own to the role. As for Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, they might disappoint those who treasure the utter insanity of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in the original. But they bring their own, more courtly comic rhythms to the roles, making the characters more human while garnering their full share of laughs. It's also nice to see such comic masters as Jon Lovitz, Andrea Martin and Michael McKean contribute cameos, out of sheer love for the project. As with any Mel Brooks production, the humor in ""The Producers"" is as broad as it possibly can be. Every ethnic and sexual stereotype is punched up to the rafters, and there are those who still regard ""Springtime for Hitler"" as beyond the pale of acceptable humor. The only way to take Mel is to let him wash all over you, a vast tidal wave of yucks, in the knowledge that laughing well is the best revenge.",4,"Springtime for Nathan, and Matthew, and Uma, and Will, and Mel.",1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,2341,"['Susan', 'Stroman', 'musical', 'film', 'Producers', ""n't"", 'quite', 'crazed', 'masterpiece', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'places', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Stroman', 'ace', 'theatrical', 'director', 'choreographer', 'who', 'performed', 'chores', 'Broadway', 'musical', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'movie', 'camera', 'other', 'bolt', 'soundstage', 'said', 'version', 'Producers', 'still', 'more', 'enough', 'laughter', 'joy', 'high', 'spirits', 'satisfy', 'audience', 'looking', 'good', 'time', 'movies', 'must', 'be', 'admitted', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'wacky', 'Gutentag', 'Hop-Clop', 'course', 'sublime', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'serviceable', 'songwriter', 'best', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Annie', 'scripter', 'Thomas', 'Meehan', 'who', 'also', 'collaborated', 'Broadway', 'version', 'Producers', 'still', 'height', 'powers', 'gagmeister', 'Mel', 'judiciously', 'cut', 'characters', 'original', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'dated', 'notably', 'Lorenzo', 'St.', 'DuBois', 'a/k/a', 'L.S.D', 'expanding', 'musical-ready', 'roles', 'Ulla', 'Roger', 'DeBris', 'Carmen', 'Ghia', 'Broadway', 'originals', 'Gary', 'Beach', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'are', 'roll-in-the-aisles', 'funny', 'Roger', 'Carmen', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'knockout', 'Ulla', 'vastly', 'better', 'singer', 'dancer', 'comedienne', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'pixilated', 'playwright', 'playwrong', 'Franz', 'Liebkind', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'equals', 'Kenneth', 'Mars', 'original', 'movie', 'bringing', 'joyous', 'heedlessness', 'own', 'role', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Max', 'Bialystock', 'Leo', 'Bloom', 'might', 'disappoint', 'who', 'treasure', 'utter', 'insanity', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'original', 'bring', 'own', 'more', 'courtly', 'comic', 'rhythms', 'roles', 'making', 'characters', 'more', 'human', 'garnering', 'full', 'share', 'laughs', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'such', 'comic', 'masters', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'contribute', 'cameos', 'sheer', 'love', 'project', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'production', 'humor', 'Producers', 'as', 'broad', 'possibly', 'can', 'be', 'Every', 'ethnic', 'sexual', 'stereotype', 'punched', 'up', 'rafters', 'are', 'who', 'still', 'regard', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'pale', 'acceptable', 'humor', 'only', 'way', 'take', 'Mel', 'let', 'wash', 'vast', 'tidal', 'wave', 'yucks', 'knowledge', 'laughing', 'well', 'best', 'revenge']",N/A

638590,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JO24,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","It's easy to forget that ""The Producers"" was originally a movie -although not a musical movie. Mel Brooks first brought this send-up of Broadway producers and the culture in front of the footlights to the screen in 1968, earning an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 2001, Brooks adapted it for the stage as a musical, and ""The Producers"" won a record-breaking 12 Tony Awards under the direction of Michael Ockrent and his much-lauded choreographer wife Susan Stroman. In 2005, ""The Producers"" returned to the silver screen with most of the original Broadway cast and Susan Stroman directing. New cast members Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell bring a bit of Hollywood to the production. The action has been moved to 1959, from 1968, for aesthetic reasons. For better or worse, it's still easy to forget that ""The Producers"" is a movie, not a theatrical production.Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) was once a great Broadway producer, now reduced to romancing money out of little old ladies to produce a seemingly endless string of flops. Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) is a meek, neurotic accountant who dreams of being a producer himself. In perusing Max's ill-kept accounts, Leo makes a curious discovery: ""Under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit."" That sounds like a plan to Max, who immediately sets out to recruit Leo into his devious enterprise and find a ""sure-fire flop"". They find it: ""Springtime for Hitler"", written by a nutty Nazi (Will Ferrell) and guaranteed to offend everyone. So Bialystock and Bloom are out to make world's shortest-lived musical....they hope.""The Producers"" gives a strong impression of a Broadway musical on film, so the audience's reaction to this movie may be largely a matter of taste. The performances are too large for film and some of the musical numbers too flashy. A great deal of effort was put into the ""I Wanna Be a Producer"" number that is Leo Bloom's fantasy sequence. Susan Stroman takes advantage of film's flexibility to create more fully realized sets and more interesting costumes than is possible in the Broadway show. But the result is dull, I'm afraid. This is a grand Broadway production number: Impressive on stage; tedious on screen. The comic musical numbers featuring Franz the Nazi, Ulla the Swedish bombshell (Uma Thurman), and flamboyant director Roger DeBris (Gary Beach) are more successful. ""The Producers"" does have its moments as bawdy comedy, but otherwise it relies heavily on the audience's willingness to embrace an over-the-top acting style in scenes that don't seem to call for it.The DVD (Universal 2006): Bonus features include 8 deleted scenes, outtakes (15 min), an ""Analysis of a Scene"" documentary, and an audio commentary. ""Analysis of a Scene: I Wanna Be a Producer"" (16 min) features interviews with director/choreographer Susan Stroman, production designer Mark Friedberg, and costume designer William Ivey Long. Stroman takes us through creating the ""I Wanna Be a Producer"" production number, from rehearsals to filming. The audio commentary by Susan Stroman is professional in tone and probably rehearsed or  self-scripted. Stroman communicates her and her colleagues enthusiasm for the musical and the movie as she takes us through the story, the genesis for the movie, talks about the cast and characters, Mel Brooks' inspirations, comments on the script and relates some on-set anecdotes.

I heard the Broadway version won tons of awards but I did not see that version so I do not know how this film version compares to it.  I can say that many times what plays on Broadway just don't make it on film and this is a prime example.  Some musicals were written for film and others for stage and many times one does not translate into the other.Nathan Lane does a decent job but Matthew Broderick, what can I say; in the casting scene one tryout attempts to do a song called ""The Little Wooden Boy""...it could have been written about Broderick.  I think he left splinters on the stage.  Let me not forget Will Ferrell, it is like Mel Brooks was imitating Bialystock and was looking to cast the ""worst possible actor for the part"".  The crappy song they gave him to sing in the roof scene didn't help and the mechanical birds may have worked on the stage but not in the film.The Ulla part was rewritten from a bit part to have a sexy girl song and dance in the musical but Uma is no Ulla.

Unfortunately, most of them were not able to accomplish a movie that will equal or surpass the musical version.  The exception was Bob Marshalls' Chicago (2002).  On said masterpiece Mr. Marshall was able to transform to the big screen an unpretentious musical from the 1970s, all in black & white with limited staging.  The movie included great stars such as Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and Queen Latifah as the prison matron.  The constant changes of scenes from the Cook County Jail to the Court Room and to the Club make of it a real masterpiece that made the movie worth winning six Oscars.Unlike Chicago, the movie version of The Producers was a great disappointment.  Director Susan Stroman (who produced the musical) failed to make the proper adaptation just filming scenes similar to the musical in the streets of NY and in Central Park.  There is neither creativity nor originality, just like a ""copy and paste"" that does not bring anything new or different to the film and half way through it makes you wish to end soon or just leave the theater.On this movie version, video and audio are great.  The roles of Max and Leo were masterfully played by Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick which were in the original Broadway musical.  Other great artists did participate in the movie;  Uma Thurman as the sexy Ulla, Gary Beach as Roger Debris and Roger Bart as Carmen Ghia.  But the greatest surprise was Will Ferrell playing the neo Nazi Franz Liebkind who is selected to play Adolf Hitler.In spite of such a great cast, the movie version falls short and become boring, especially for those that were able to see the musical performance in NY or on the road.

It all goes wrong when the musical becomes an unintentional success.The difference between the new film and the old is that the new film is a musical with songs all the way through - instead of the original that has a performance of the musical stage show, Springtime for Hitler, in the middle of it.

638607,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B00005JO24,Poor Napoleon,"[6, 7]","Mel Brooks had a great vision for the film version of the Producers musical - to film it exactly as it would have been seen on stage.  Brooks knew that the Producers was something special.  However, the crew behind the film knew there had to be changes, yet wanted to remain faithful to Brooks' wishes at the same time.  The end result has spectacular performances, music, and script, but somehow doesn't work.The main element that has not transitioned to the screen is the spontanaety of the actors, well versed in their lines, demonstrating a fine chemistry only found by seasoned stage performers.  What looks marvelous on stage doesn't neccessarily look as great on screen.  Case in point is the scene immediately after the show stopping Springtime For Hitler sequence, where Ballystock and Bloom are at their office, bouting it out against cops, the director, screenwriter, and themselves.  Played out on stage, this must have been a riot!  The magic doesn't translate as well as that immediacy of the stage is lost.The other element that muddled the film  a bit is the fact that filmgoers who are familiar with the original, but not of the musical maybe a bit put off by how Lane and Broderick struggle to find their niche in the shoes previously held by Zero Mostel and Gen Wilder.  I suppose if you watch the film as a seperate piece from the original, this does not pose a problem.

638609,A30Y7BMN57OV0E,B00005JO24,"Rachel Newstead ""finder of forgotten animation""","[1, 2]","Poor Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane). A once-great Broadway producer (or so he tells us) he's now relegated to seducing rich little old ladies to finance his dismal plays. His latest (""Funny Boy,"" a musical version oif ""Hamlet"") is all too typical of his output in the last few years. His plays are so bad, a special theater marquee was devised to change from ""Opening Night"" to ""Closing Night"" with the flick of a switch. He's on a long, slow, descent into obscurity.Enter mousy, neurotic accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) who comes to Max's seedy Schubert Theater office to do the books. Leo's got problems of his own: he still carries the blue blanket he had when he was a baby (and goes into wild, funny hysterics when it's taken from him). He's unsatisfied with his job, and also destined to go nowhere. Until, while looking at a seeming discrepancy in Max's figures for ""Funny Boy,"" he offhandedly comes up with a scheme to save them both--one that could only have come from the twisted mind of Mel Brooks.To those of you new to this story, a little background:Once upon a time, back in 1968, Mel Brooks made his first movie, a raunchy, biting satire of Broadway called ""The Producers.""  It was eventually hailed as not only his funniest picture, but one of the funniest ever made. It was only natural to adapt this skewering of Broadway to the Broadway stage, which Brooks finally does in 2001. It wins an unbelievable 12 Tony awards, not bad for a newcomer to Broadway. So what do to next? Why, a movie musical of ""The Producers,"" of course, bringing Mel full circle.Anyway, back to our friends Leo and Max. Leo mentions that under the right circumstances, a dishonest producer could make more money from a flop than a hit. Since Max is just that sort of dishonest producer, he takes to the idea immediately. The plan: find the worst, most offensive play ever written, one sure to close almost as soon as it opens. Overfinance it to the hilt, pocket the difference and skip off to Rio. On that dubious premise, we're off and running.It doesn't take them long to find just the right (or is that wrong?) play--not just bad, but according to Max, ""the mother lode"": ""Springtime For Hitler,"" described as a ""gay romp with Adolf and Eva in Bertchesgaden."" Leo and Max find the ""playwright"", a crazy Nazi named Franz Liebkind (Will Farrell) who lives on the roof of a building, with only pigeons for company. The next step--find the absolute worst director imaginable, which they find in the stereotypically but hilariously flamboyant Roger DeBris (Gary Beach, reprising his Broadway role), who when we first meet him is wearing a sequined evening gown. He's enthralled with the play, remarking ""I never knew the Third Reich meant Germany..."" Oh-kay. Moving on...Enter the complication to this little scheme, Swedish bombshell Ulla (whose full name is so long I'd have to put it in a separate review) with whom Leo falls madly in love, while Max is hungrily anticipating his first encounter in years with someone under eighty. Ulla (Uma Thurman) becomes ""Springtime's"" female lead and Max and Leo's nominal secretary, despite the fact she can barely speak English (not that our two heroes notice, mind you).On opening night, everything seems to be going according to plan. Liebkind, who's playing the lead, literally breaks his leg before he can go on, so DeBris goes on in his place. It's sure to be a disaster, right? Wrong. He camps it up so much, the audience considers it a brilliant satire. The panicked Max and Leo wonder where they ""went right,"" and find themselves staring at a stretch in prison. Can they get out of this mess?I should say this: if you're a fan of the original 1968 movie, you'll probably find this wanting. The original leads, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, unfortunately cast a long shadow. For someone like me, though, who didn't even see the original movie until the musical was popular, Lane and Broderick are more than worthy stand-ins for Mostel and Wilder. Broderick comes off a little better, actually, being more nebbishy and less manic than Wilder--perfect for the sort of character he's playing. Lane goes out of his way to evoke his predecessor, even emulating Mostel's infamous combover, and gives the character a smarmy sort of charm even Mostel couldn't manage. The songs, written by Brooks himself, are wonderfully catchy (even, dare I say it, ""Springtime For Hitler""). Even the production numbers of the supposedly bad play-within-a play are entertaining, and expanded considerably from the original movie, where they had served as little more than a sight gag.While I'm usually irritated by ""stunt casting"", Will Farrell as Liebkind was a pleasant surprise, being far funnier than I originally expected. (The animatronic ""heiling"" pigeons, supplied by the Jim Henson shop, didn't hurt either).The only thing preventing a five-star review is the fact that director Susan Stroman (Mel's Broadway director) chose to remove the Broadway show's best number, ""King Of Broadway."" As well known as that song has become, that's comparable to taking the song ""Oklahoma"" out of the play bearing its name, or removing ""The Rain In Spain"" from ""My Fair Lady."" But fear not, the number was filmed, and can be seen as one of the DVD's extras. Other cuts Stroman made are also included as extras, making one wonder about her editing choices. More than a few should have been kept in, to help the flow of the movie and clarify the plot a bit.One has the option of hearing Stroman's (unfortunately nasally) scene-by-scene commentary, but it didn't really add much background to the film. Better is the featurette analyzing one musical number, the wonderfully staged ""I Wanna Be A Producer.""I strongly recommend to fans of both the original and current film to purchase both versions--each is bound to find something worth liking in the other. Whether this will be Brooks' last picture is uncertain, but if it is, ""The Producers"" is the perfect swan song to an ingenious career.",4,Springtime For Hitler--And Mel Brooks,1155168000,"08 10,

He enlists the accountant's help in devising a scheme to do that, which entails an atrocious play called Springtime For Hitler written by an ex-Nazi (Will Ferrell).Nathan Lane seems like he's immitating Zero Mostel, rather than making the role his own, and Matthew Broderick seems like he's immitating Jerry Lewis, both of them with cutesy-squeaky baby voices. All that's before the gay characters come on scene. Broderick demonstrates his talent in some dance numbers reminiscent of the old Hollywood musicals.

What works onstage doesn't necessarily work on  screen, and sadly, 'The Producers' is one or two numbers too long for its own good.Still, for the most part, it's an extremely enjoyable and worthwhile movie.Bookish, nervy accountant Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick), while going over the books of failure-prone Broadway producer Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane), realises that with a little dishonesty and a lot of capital, they could make more money from a flop than a hit. Finding the best script for the job - 'Springtime for Hitler' by neo-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell) - and hiring all manner of talentless Broadway hangers-on, including Swedish bombshell Ulla (Uma Thurman), they set about making the worst show in the history of entertainment, to make the most money possible.Performances are manic, energetic and hilarious - particularly Nathan Lane's turn as Max, and Desperate Housewives' Roger Bart as Carmen - and the script is lively and funny. I'm very pleased that the production company decided to keep a decidedly 'theatrical' feel about the whole film - movements are stage-big, numbers are simple and elegant, and the whole look and feel of 'The Producers' hearkens very much back to a Hollywood of the 1940s and 1950s - big numbers, big voices and big visuals.The actual 'Springtime For Hitler' sequence is similarly hilarious, and similarly simplistic - but all the more rewarding for it. This is how all Broadway-to-Hollywood adaptations should be handled: forget the sex appeal, forget the movie polish, forget the dumbing-down - 'The Producers' gets it right.Sadly, 'The Producers' also suffers from the one big problem that almost all stage-to-screen adaptations suffer from - it's just too long. In a theatre, we rely on character interaction and dialogue or songs to keep our interest, but in a motion picture, with its more generous scope for visual creativity, we don't need the same level of content, and, as with 'Rent' and 'Chicago' before it, 'The Producers' doesn't quite manage to retain our attention or its own momentum to the end of the movie.But still, it's great fun, and well worth owning - but only if this sort of thing is your cup of tea. 'The Producers' is very good - but won't win any new fans to the genre.",3,The Musical is dead!

Zwick,"[5, 10]","**1/2Few films have made as complete a round trip through the entertainment world as Mel Brooks' ""The Producers,"" which started life as a movie in 1968, became a smash Tony Award winning Broadway musical in 2001, and now returns to the silver screen, all spruced up but with much of its heart taken out.Virtually everyone is familiar with the story of Max Bialystock, a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer who discovers that, through some loopholes in the tax laws, one can actually make more money from a show that flops than one that succeeds.  Thus, he and his milquetoast accountant, Leo Bloom, set about putting on the worst Broadway show of all time, a musical entitled ""Springtime for Hitler,"" that is guaranteed to bomb at the box office, making the two producers instant millionaires.  What Max fails to take into account is the old show biz adage that ""no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public,"" and, thus, much to his dismay, he soon finds himself with a certified hit on his hands.One of the problems ""The Producers"" faces right off the bat is the memories the audience brings with them of the original movie.  Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, good as they are in the lead roles (and they are VERY good), still cannot rise to the level of the great Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder who came before them.  One need only compare the two movies side by side and scene by scene to see that Mostel and Wilder literally own these roles.  That doesn't mean that one can't enjoy Lane's and Broderick's on-screen antics here - just that it helps if one doesn't come to the movie already prejudiced by over-familiarity with the source.Brooks himself has penned the musical score which features clever lyrics and jaunty, if not exactly memorable, tunes.  The song-and-dance numbers are reasonably well mounted, although Susan Stroman's direction leans, for the most part, towards the boxy and the stagy.When ""The Producers"" was first released in 1968, it seemed wildly iconoclastic, daring and cutting edge, a perfect reflection of the no-holds-barred, everything-goes decade that spawned it.  Now, coming back to us in the form of a high-priced, award-laden musical, set inexplicably in the 1950's, it feels strangely like a relic - old-fashioned, claustrophobic, stuffy and embalmed.  Gone is the freshness and immediacy and glorious bad taste that came with the original.  It`s just not vital anymore.There are still sporadic moments of pleasure to be had with this ""Producers.""

This is a separate entertainment, and while some is the same, it's very difference and should be judged on its own. The Mel Brooks musical score is 10 out of 10.  What a great songwriter he is. He certainly deserved the Tony prize that became his on Tony night.  Nathan Lane is superb, as usual. Matthew Broderick is just ok..he played the role as ""too crazy"" so instead of being a nice guy you feel sorry for, one sits there watching and feels he is actually crazy instead of a sympathetic character who needs a blanket for comfort. That is also the director's (Susan Strohman) responsibility, to be sure they are in the correct character.The musical numbers are fantastic and staged beautifully.  Sure, this was really a filmed version of the broadway show (minus the most important song, sadly cut: King of Broadway, which needed to be there to explain Max's character, it's provided as an ""extra"" on the dvd, so was actually filmed. But what's wrong with keeping with the theatrical formula? I say nothing. It is opened up to film with the nursing home and some scenes done outside, yet stays close to the broadway experience, which I saw five times.  Aparently the critics had a problem with that...but sitting there for over 2 hours and loving the entire thing, seems they are gettting very picky these days and just can't enjoy a musical made today that is in the style of the great MGM musicals, and this was.

A national treasure, Brooks takes both the musical and the movies to new comic depths with ""The Producers,"" his film adaptation of his recent broadway smash, which was itself a stage adaptation of the 1968 movie, ""The Producers.""  (Brooks not only knows that you don't change horses in mid-stream, you don't abandon the horse after it's been made into dog food.)Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their stage roles and the roles made famous by Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in the original film.  While it's safe to say that neither Lane nor Broderick can equal Mostel and Wilder in the clowning-around department, they both got game.  ""The Producers"" is funny in the classic sense - there is no post-modern attempt at irony here, just plain old clever wordplay and slapstick.  Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell round out the Big Hollywood Names in the case, and they generally hold their own as an oversexed Scandinavian actress and a Hitler-sympathizing writer, respectively.Like many Mel Brooks movies, ""The Producers"" can wear a bit thin at times.  While many comedies bog down because they only have about fifteen to twenty funny minutes stretched into a 90-minute movie, Brooks' films almost get tedious because the humor never freaking stops!  Brooks crams jokes into the margins of the movie once he's finished building the structure - look for Broadway show posters advertising ""King Leer"" and ""The Breaking Wind,"" for example.  Or the ""Heil Hitler"" salute from the chorus line of pigeons.  Or, in the closing credits, Will Ferrell (in character, of course) plugging the paperback edition of ""Mein Kampf.""  Again, nobody but Brooks could pull this off.The only truly bothersome element of the movie for me was Broderick's over-the-top nebbishy voice . . . it was almost (almost!) as annoying as Ben Stiller's Derek Zoolander voice or even Adam Sandler's Billy Madison.  But others have found Broderick's voice hliarous . . . it just didn't click for me.  Broderick's overall performance and his singing was excellent, however.If you still need more encouraging to check out ""The Producers,"" read any of the dozens of reviews that discuss its beyond-outlandish plot.

This movie is not a ""remake"" as such, but a different presentation of the basic story.  It needs to be reviewed on its own lack of merit.I simply cannot believe that this treatment was a hit on Broadway and received numerous awards, but people have told me that the theatre version was much better.Don't mistake though, this movie is awful, and for a multitude of reasons.  I watched it to the very end, mostly out of curiosity and hoping it would get better.  It never did.The acting is either over the top, or wooden.  Matthew Broderick is particularly bad, there's no life in his character- and Nathan Lane seems to be unable to make up his mind between taking the part of Max for his own or doing a lousy imitation of Zero Mostel.  Uma Thurman was a questionable choice for Ulla. Her accent is inconsistent, she towers over her co-stars- neither of which are tall men, and when you boil it down, she is somewhat gangley and strange looking.  Don't even get me started on how bad Will Ferrell is.  His take on Franz is pathetic.  He tries to give his character the wild-eyed fanaticism that it requires, but you get the overall impression that he's just camping it up and actually making fun of it.  He's no Kenneth Mars.  The sequence on the roof where Max and Leo have him sign the contract- one of the funniest parts of the original movie- is probably the worst part of this one.The supporting cast is lousy too. The character of ""Carmen Ghia"" comes to mind. Originally the effeminate partner of Roger Debris, he comes off as a drill sergeant in a lousy haircut and tight clothes.Even the jokes that were lifted from the original movie have been stepped on or rearranged to where they aren't funny. I think I may have laughed twice during the whole movie, and that was at the goofy show posters in Max's office.This movie is also a rather strange ""musical."" When I saw ""Chicago"" for the first time, I found myself humming the tunes.  I cannot recall one from this movie.I also have many problems with the needless revisions in the original plot.Everyone who watched the original movie knew that Max ""went right"" when he selected LSD as his Hitler.  His portrayal of Hitler was hilarious, and Franz Liebkind's reaction to it convinced the audience that the play was a comedy.  However, LSD is absent from this movie.  The Hitler part goes- eventually- to Debris!  There is nothing really funny about the Hitler portrayed by him, or his material.  Actually, it's somewhat boring.  How did people interpret this to be comedic?Having Leo married and off to Rio with Ulla did nothing either.  Apparently it was just another device to work more unmemorable music into the movie.Finally, there is the length of this thing- OVER TWO HOURS!  It's a marathon.

638627,A8LFXWE1VZ94A,B00005JO24,SylvesterFox007,"[2, 3]","First, ""The Producers"" was a comedy movie by Mel Brooks.  Then, ""The Producers"" was a Broadway musical.  Now, ""The Producers"" is a movie again, and this time it's a musical as well as proof that Mel Brook's ideas never cease to be funny.If you already know the concept of ""The Producers"", there's not much of a plot to spoil.  Down on his luck Broadway producer Max Bialystock (Nathan Lane) convinces his neurotic accountant (Matthew Broderick) to be his partner in crime.  Together, the duo concoct a scheme to defraud Bialystock's investors by intentionally producing a flop and then run off with millions.  Then there's a neo-Nazi playwright (Will Ferrell), a barely in the closet directorial team (Gary Beach and Roger Bart), the extremely sexy Uma Thurman, and several awkward moments involving little old ladies, leading up to the staging of ""Springtime for Hitler.""  But then the intended flop is misinterpreted as a biting satire and becomes a hit, leaving the two frantic producers thinking fast to avoid prison time.From beginning to end, ""The Producers"" is filled with sharp jokes, most of them beautifully politically incorrect, but none of them crude.  Of course, when has Mel Brooks, the genius behind ""Spaceballs"" ever not been funny?  Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, both of whom have already played their roles on Broadway, play their roles to perfection, wearing their characters as comfortably as their own skin.  Will Ferrell's also great in his role.  Like Mel Brooks, he's never been unfunny.  Most importantly, everyone in the cast seems to genuinely be enjoying themselves, playing their parts strictly for laughs and making the most extravagant dance steps look natural.The highlight of the film is the staging of ""Springtime for Hitler"", a hilariously offensive number with such lyrical gems as ""We're marching to a faster pace, look out, here comes the master race"" and ""Don't be stupid, be a smarty, come and join the Nazi party.""  The other songs are catchy, and most of them add to the comic genius of the film, but, as with all musicals, some of the song and dance numbers fall flat.  Also, the ending seems just a little contrived and tacked-on.  Still, ""The Producers"" is overall the funniest musical comedy since Joseph L. Mankiewitz's ""Guys and Dolls.""",5,A Flop That Should Have Been a Hit About a Hit That Should Have Been a Flop,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2290,"['First', 'Producers', 'was', 'comedy', 'movie', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Then', 'Producers', 'was', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Now', 'Producers', 'movie', 'again', 'time', 'musical', 'as', 'well', 'proof', 'Mel', 'Brook', 'ideas', 'never', 'cease', 'be', 'funny.If', 'already', 'know', 'concept', 'Producers', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'spoil', 'Down', 'luck', 'Broadway', 'producer', 'Max', 'Bialystock', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'neurotic', 'accountant', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'be', 'partner', 'crime', 'Together', 'duo', 'scheme', 'defraud', 'Bialystock', 'investors', 'intentionally', 'producing', 'flop', 'then', 'run', 'off', 'millions', 'Then', 'neo-Nazi', 'playwright', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'barely', 'closet', 'directorial', 'team', 'Gary', 'Beach', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'extremely', 'sexy', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'several', 'awkward', 'moments', 'involving', 'little', 'old', 'ladies', 'leading', 'up', 'staging', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'then', 'intended', 'flop', 'misinterpreted', 'biting', 'satire', 'hit', 'leaving', 'two', 'frantic', 'producers', 'thinking', 'fast', 'avoid', 'prison', 'beginning', 'end', 'Producers', 'filled', 'sharp', 'jokes', 'most', 'beautifully', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'none', 'crude', 'course', 'when', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'genius', 'Spaceballs', 'ever', 'not', 'been', 'funny', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'whom', 'have', 'already', 'played', 'roles', 'Broadway', 'play', 'roles', 'perfection', 'wearing', 'characters', 'as', 'comfortably', 'own', 'skin', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'also', 'great', 'role', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'never', 'been', 'unfunny', 'Most', 'importantly', 'everyone', 'cast', 'genuinely', 'be', 'enjoying', 'playing', 'parts', 'strictly', 'laughs', 'making', 'most', 'extravagant', 'dance', 'steps', 'look', 'natural.The', 'highlight', 'film', 'staging', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'hilariously', 'offensive', 'number', 'such', 'lyrical', 'gems', ""'re"", 'marching', 'faster', 'pace', 'look', 'out', 'here', 'master', 'race', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'stupid', 'be', 'smarty', 'come', 'join', 'Nazi', 'party', 'other', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'most', 'add', 'comic', 'genius', 'film', 'musicals', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'fall', 'flat', 'Also', 'ending', 'just', 'little', 'contrived', 'tacked-on', 'Still', 'Producers', 'funniest', 'musical', 'comedy', 'Joseph', 'L.', 'Mankiewitz', 'Guys', 'Dolls']",N/A

638629,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JO24,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 4]","Max Bialystock's (Nathan Lane) latest Broadway flop, ""Happy Guy"", a musical based on ""Hamlet"", has just opened and closed on the same night. His accountant, Leo Bloom (Matthew Broderick) reviews the books and realizes Max raised $2,000 more than he spent on the show. Because the show flopped, this isn't a huge problem, leading Leo to surmise that a producer could make more from a flop than a hit. Max latches onto the idea and they partner to find a surefire stinker. Max and Leo stumble upon ""Springtime for Hitler"" by Franz Liebkind (Will Ferrell), the perfect candidate and then hire the worst director on Broadway, Roger De Bris (Gary Beach) and his ""common law"" assistant Carmen Ghia (Roger Bart). All the makings of a surefire flop. Right?Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" returns to the big screen, via the Great White Way, in this musical version starring many of the same actors who appeared in the show on Broadway. This new version is fun, slightly different, more of a compliment, than a replacement, to the original starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.Lane and Broderick are both very good. Lane bears a striking resemblance to Mostel and, initially, I found this to be distracting. Physically, he could almost be Mostel's doppelganger down to the greasy comb-over. But after a while, you just have to let it go. Yes, he looks and acts like the famous comedian, but Lane is a funny guy in his own right. And a pretty good singer. The combination of his manic energy and his ability to sing, make it easy to see why Lane is always such a hit on Broadway. Strangely, Lane had another huge hit on Broadway some years ago with a new production of ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum"" in which he took on the role originated by, you guessed it, Zero Mostel.And Lane, with his rich history on Broadway, is a great choice to reinterpret Bialystock. He doesn't reinterpret so much as he refocuses. Bialystock is a desperate man, mounting one flop after another, desperate for the next chance at a hit. Each of these flops takes more out of him that he cares to let on, or admit to. His investors, a group of female senior citizens, complete with blue hair and walkers, will give him their `checkie' only after a little `touch me- feel me'. Lane humorously conveys the desperation and resignation his character has come to realize. Much more attracted to his new secretary, Ulla (Uma Thurman), a Swedish bombshell, he realizes the geriatric set is his bread and butter and he has to keep them happy.Matthew Broderick is a big surprise. He hasn't been this funny, this uninhibited in a long time, since perhaps ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". As Leo Bloom, he only hints at Gene Wilder's performance, making the role his own. The moment when he freaks out and reveals his security blanket is a truly funny bit, immediately creating the character, neuroses and all.Perhaps the biggest surprise is that Uma Thurman can sing and dance, assuming someone isn't singing for her. As Ulla, she makes the dumb vixen believable. But in the performance, we get a sense that she isn't just dumb; there is maybe just a little bit more to her. Sure she's beautiful, she's dumb, but she also has dreams, wants to fall in love.Of course, the main difference between the two film versions, the main reason the film was remade, is the addition of music. Someone somewhere recognized that the material, about Broadway producers trying to mount a huge flop, was a natural to be a musical in its own right. The 1968 version only had a little music, during the actual stage production. This new version has music throughout, providing homage to the musicals of the 40s and 50s.I'm not sure why they made this decision, but ""The Producers"" is a very old-fashioned musical. It was the right decision and I even get the sense it was a calculated decision. Let's face it. The demographic that goes to see a Broadway musical isn't getting any younger. Rather than attempt to get this group to enjoy a more modern musical, they have catered to this demographic, turning back the clock and making ""The Producers"" homage to the great studio musicals. The calculation clearly paid off. The Broadway show earned one of the highest one day ticket sales ever recorded.The film retains many of these old-fashioned elements, leading us to expect Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire to appear at any moment. It may not be groundbreaking, but it works. In ""I Wanna Be a Producer"", Matthew Broderick escapes a mind-numbing job as an accountant and imagines dancing with an ever-increasing cast of dancing girls up, down, over and across steps reflecting his name in lights. Broderick and Lane share ""We Can Do It"", each singing different verses, until they are soon singing the same song. Lane and Thurman pay homage to Astaire and Rogers as they dance through Bialystock's newly painted white office, as tinges of blue glow through out. All of this works because it is done well and could've been lifted straight from a Gene Kelly film.It is refreshing to watch a ""Mel Brooks' Film"" again. Let's face it. ""Blazing Saddles"" would never be made today in a Hollywood filled with people afraid of what might offend someone. ""Blazing Saddles"" is a hilarious film, but many of the jokes are at the expense of particular types of people. The ""outrageous"" comedies we see today are all about Caucasians getting into ""outrageous"" situations. ""The Producers"" is a mild throwback to an era that would make a ""Mel Brooks' Film"", at least when they were funny. Brooks' funniest films are his most outrageous, filled with many un-PC jokes. ""The Producers"" is a milder, tamer, but still funny version of the old Mel Brooks we all loved. Roger De Bris (Gary Beach) and Carmen Ghia (Roger Bart) are the kind of characters only Mel Brooks would, could put in a film. By the time Brooks is done, we have a man dressing in a ball gown and wig, the Village People dancing down stairs and a gay swami all added to the mix. And it's funny.I'm not sure how the idea popped into Mel Brooks' head, but it was a good idea and now ""The Producers"" has come full circle.",3,A Nice Compliment to the Original,1136764800,"01 9,

Mel Brooks even inserts a joke about it at one point, when Uma Thurman coos to Broderick, ""Why did you move away from me stage left?""Which is what ultimately makes ""The Producers"" an average movie. Everything is played out as broadly as possible and the opening sequence is so shrilly overbearing as to almost put you off the rest of the film. Patience is rewarded by some of Brooks' trademark humor and sight-gags, with the old-lady walker dance enough to give the movie a boost in the ratings. Then there's the ultimate; the hideous play the two decide to use for the scam; ""Springtime For Hitler."" Given that this ruse was pivotal tothe original Producers, it's virtually intact from the first. naturally, it's also the film's highlight.Even with that classic set piece, ""The Producers"" fails to catch fire. The bits are strung out and uneven, and never meet the heights of the original. Matthew Broderick in particular seems out of his league here, playing Leo as a wooden nebbish, while Nathan Lane channels Zero Mostel adequately. Will Ferrell is his usual mad-manboy self, which is good, and Gary Beach is an outrage as the flamboyant director DeBris, who takes the role of Hitler...and wrecks Leo and Max's plans. Even with all this going for it, ""The Producers"" can't seem to maintain the timing it needs to be a flat out success. For Mel Brooks fans only, with a few musical buffs that might life to see the skewer Brooks and the cast drive into the heart of the great white way.",3,Where did we go....right?,1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,1872,"['answer', 'not', 'many', 'places', 'film', 'musical', 'original', 'movie', 'back', 'bunch', 'stage', 'stars', 'notably', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'try', 'recapture', 'what', 'brought', 'Broadway', 'ticket', 'holders', 'out', 'droves', 'However', 'old', 'fashioned', 'musical-to-film', 'style', 'where', 'movie', 'often', 'stage', 'play', 'simply', 'acted', 'out', 'cameras', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'even', 'joke', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Broderick', 'Why', 'did', 'move', 'away', 'stage', 'left', 'Which', 'what', 'ultimately', 'Producers', 'average', 'movie', 'Everything', 'played', 'out', 'as', 'broadly', 'possible', 'opening', 'sequence', 'so', 'shrilly', 'overbearing', 'almost', 'put', 'off', 'rest', 'film', 'Patience', 'rewarded', 'Brooks', 'trademark', 'humor', 'sight-gags', 'old-lady', 'walker', 'dance', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'boost', 'ratings', 'Then', 'ultimate', 'hideous', 'play', 'two', 'decide', 'use', 'scam', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'ruse', 'was', 'pivotal', 'tothe', 'original', 'Producers', 'virtually', 'intact', 'first', 'naturally', 'also', 'film', 'highlight.Even', 'classic', 'set', 'piece', 'Producers', 'catch', 'fire', 'bits', 'are', 'strung', 'out', 'uneven', 'never', 'meet', 'heights', 'original', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'particular', 'league', 'here', 'playing', 'Leo', 'wooden', 'nebbish', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'channels', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'adequately', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'usual', 'mad-manboy', 'self', 'good', 'Gary', 'Beach', 'outrage', 'flamboyant', 'director', 'DeBris', 'who', 'role', 'Hitler', 'wrecks', 'Leo', 'Max', 'plans', 'Even', 'going', 'Producers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'maintain', 'timing', 'be', 'flat', 'out', 'success', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'fans', 'only', 'few', 'musical', 'buffs', 'might', 'life', 'see', 'skewer', 'Brooks', 'cast', 'drive', 'heart', 'great', 'white', 'way']",N/A

Some of its problems can be traced to the stage show - Mel Brooks' musical score is still thin despite much improved orchestration and, though toned down from his deeply irritating stage performance, Matthew Broderick misjudges things quite badly more often than not, while there's no excuse for flattening 'Springtime For Hitler' by padding it out to three times its length (indeed, this remake clocks in at three-quarters of an hour longer than the original). Some problems are unique to the film version: certainly if you're one of the many wondering why some people find Will Ferrell funny, you'll find no answer here in his terrible performance, while cutting the 'King of Broadway' number (to be found among the deleted scenes on the DVD) seems a misjudgement as it's one of the funnier and better staged numbers.Nathan Lane does well enough as Bialystock, although he's given a little too much rope to be at his best, Uma Thurman is better than expected and even Susan Strohman's direction isn't as bad as it's been made out, far more cinematic than her critics claim although it doesn't entirely escape the feeling that the only reason there isn't a fourth wall on screen is because there wasn't one in the theatre. Still, the 'I Want to Be a Producer' production number is an impressive throwback to some of the lesser MGM musicals, and the theatricality of 'That Face' works surprisingly well. It's certainly better than the screen versions of many Broadway musicals churned out in the 60s or 70s, but the tighter-paced and much better scripted original needn't worry about it stealing its thunder.Decent extras include 19 minutes of deleted scenes, a 15-minute blooper reel and short about the 'I Want to be a Producer' number, though Susan Strohman's commentary doesn't exactly command your attention.",3,"Not quite a Bialystock & Bloom production, but no triumph either",1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,1933,"['remake', 'Producers', ""n't"", 'quite', 'catastrophe', 'been', 'painted', 'still', 'long', 'way', 'success', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'stage', 'show', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'musical', 'score', 'still', 'thin', 'much', 'improved', 'orchestration', 'though', 'toned', 'down', 'deeply', 'irritating', 'stage', 'performance', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'things', 'quite', 'badly', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'excuse', 'flattening', ""'Springtime"", 'Hitler', 'padding', 'three', 'times', 'length', 'indeed', 'remake', 'three-quarters', 'hour', 'longer', 'original', 'problems', 'are', 'unique', 'film', 'version', 'certainly', ""'re"", 'one', 'many', 'wondering', 'why', 'people', 'find', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'find', 'answer', 'here', 'terrible', 'performance', 'cutting', ""'King"", 'Broadway', 'number', 'be', 'found', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'misjudgement', 'one', 'funnier', 'better', 'staged', 'numbers.Nathan', 'Lane', 'well', 'enough', 'Bialystock', 'given', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'rope', 'be', 'best', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'better', 'expected', 'even', 'Susan', 'Strohman', 'direction', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'been', 'made', 'out', 'far', 'more', 'cinematic', 'critics', 'claim', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'escape', 'feeling', 'only', 'reason', ""n't"", 'fourth', 'wall', 'screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'theatre', 'Still', 'Want', 'Be', 'Producer', 'production', 'number', 'impressive', 'throwback', 'lesser', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'theatricality', ""'That"", 'Face', 'works', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'certainly', 'better', 'screen', 'versions', 'many', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'churned', 'out', '60s', '70s', 'tighter-paced', 'much', 'better', 'scripted', 'original', 'need', ""n't"", 'worry', 'stealing', 'thunder.Decent', 'extras', 'include', '19', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', '15-minute', 'blooper', 'reel', 'short', 'Want', 'be', 'Producer', 'number', 'Susan', 'Strohman', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'command', 'attention']",N/A
638632,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JO24,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","From the very beginning, director Susan Stroman's intention is obvious. Stroman, who also directed the critically acclaimed Broadway original stage production of `The Producers,' must have thought it best to film the stage production as it is, instead of introducing any cinematic skills into it. True, she did add the glitter of the golden era of MGM musicals with superb production designs, but the entire feeling of watching this film is like seeing the well-choreographed singers and dancers through a video camera set in front of the Broadway stage.Having said that, thanks to the superb acting from the cast, I admit the film remains very entertaining. In spite of staleness seen in several parts of the film, at least it worked for me, and the pair of Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, who need to produce the worst stage ever to get rich quickly, is fun to see. I don't say they are better than the former pair of Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel in the original film, and some part of their performances look as if repeating the turns of Wilder/Mostel (Broderick's nervous accountant looks like a copy of funnier and more sentimental Wilder's), but they are truly in character, which explains their huge success on stage, and yes, I know it is unfair to make comparison here with the older film made 38 years ago.But when the capable supporting actors appear on the screen after the earlier chapters, the newer version gets better. Actually, the more supports it shows, the better it gets. See the hilarious pigeon-keeping writer Will Ferrell and sexy Swedish girl Uma Thurman, and you know what I mean. Gary Beach and Roger Bart are real hoot, stealing every scene from the leads with excellent performances. And of course the most `terrible' musical you've ever seen `Springtime for Hitler.' It was a real showstopper in the original Mel Brookes film, and it still is now with more ridiculous costumes and the deliciously silly dancing of Storm Troopers. And again with Gary Beach and his brief but fantastic turn as Fuhrer.If you insist that this should be a cinema, not a filmed record of the stage, then you will dislike `The Producers' for the lack of any cinematic style to re-conceptualize the material. I don't know why Mel Brooks (who briefly appears at the VERY end of the film) handed the job of direction to Susan Stroman, which is obviously a mistake as film director if not a choreographer. I enjoyed the film for what it is, but I don't know that you would feel the same way after seeing this.",4,(3.5 STARS) Very Entertaining Musical But You May Not Like the Film's Stagy Approach,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,2514,"['very', 'beginning', 'director', 'Susan', 'Stroman', 'intention', 'obvious', 'Stroman', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Broadway', 'original', 'stage', 'production', 'Producers', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'best', 'film', 'stage', 'production', 'instead', 'introducing', 'cinematic', 'skills', 'True', 'did', 'add', 'glitter', 'golden', 'era', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'superb', 'production', 'designs', 'entire', 'feeling', 'watching', 'film', 'seeing', 'well-choreographed', 'singers', 'dancers', 'video', 'camera', 'set', 'front', 'Broadway', 'stage.Having', 'said', 'thanks', 'superb', 'acting', 'cast', 'admit', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'spite', 'staleness', 'seen', 'several', 'parts', 'film', 'least', 'worked', 'pair', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'who', 'need', 'produce', 'worst', 'stage', 'ever', 'get', 'rich', 'quickly', 'fun', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'better', 'former', 'pair', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'original', 'film', 'part', 'performances', 'look', 'repeating', 'turns', 'Wilder/Mostel', 'Broderick', 'nervous', 'accountant', 'looks', 'copy', 'funnier', 'more', 'sentimental', 'Wilder', 'are', 'truly', 'character', 'huge', 'success', 'stage', 'yes', 'know', 'unfair', 'make', 'comparison', 'here', 'older', 'film', 'made', '38', 'years', 'ago.But', 'when', 'capable', 'supporting', 'actors', 'appear', 'screen', 'earlier', 'chapters', 'newer', 'version', 'better', 'Actually', 'more', 'supports', 'better', 'See', 'hilarious', 'pigeon-keeping', 'writer', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'sexy', 'Swedish', 'girl', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Gary', 'Beach', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'are', 'real', 'hoot', 'stealing', 'scene', 'leads', 'excellent', 'performances', 'course', 'most', 'terrible', 'musical', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'was', 'real', 'showstopper', 'original', 'Mel', 'Brookes', 'film', 'still', 'now', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'costumes', 'deliciously', 'silly', 'dancing', 'Storm', 'Troopers', 'again', 'Gary', 'Beach', 'brief', 'fantastic', 'turn', 'Fuhrer.If', 'insist', 'should', 'be', 'cinema', 'not', 'filmed', 'record', 'stage', 'then', 'will', 'dislike', 'Producers', 'lack', 'cinematic', 'style', 're-conceptualize', 'material', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'who', 'briefly', 'VERY', 'end', 'film', 'handed', 'job', 'direction', 'Susan', 'Stroman', 'obviously', 'mistake', 'film', 'director', 'not', 'choreographer', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'seeing']",N/A

The story is witty and clever, but after the Springtime for Hitler scene, it falls flat. The songs are very forgettable. Majority of the songs are either too silly, mediocre, or just plain not good, some which seem to come off as fillers. Kind of a shame, since songs in musicals are the highlight of the show! Also, even though Nathan Lane and Matthew Brodwick make a great team, i just don't think Matthew is a great actor. He has no personality or character whatswhoever, just plain bland. Nathan Lane steals the show! Despite that, there were a few laugh out loud scenes that i really enjoyed (such as the scenes with Will Farrel as Franz Liebkind, and Gary Beach with his gay musical number). And despite the subject matter of the awkward play within a play, ""Springtime for Hitler,"" it was the most hilarious scene of the movie.

I very much wanted to see the play, but it didn't happen for me.So when the movie-oh horrors, the REMAKE--came out, I had mixed feelings, only I knew it wasn't really a remake but it was the play taken from the 1968 version made into a movie!

And by the time hysterical Broderick is on the floor in terror, squealing ""You're going to JUMP on me! Please don't JUMP on me!"" I was finished. I laughed as long and hard during this movie as the last one, but they really cannot be compared. The first was a classic; this is a hilariously funny musical with the best parts of the first movie pretty much left intact.Where do I start with the acting? Nathan Lane was/is a magnificent Max Bialystock, as good as or even better than Zero Mostel. Broderick does not play Bloom the way Wilder did, and good for him. He made the role completely his own. I thought Uma Thurman was hilarious and gorgeous and who knew she could dance like that, let along sing? She was a masterpiece. Will Ferrell, in my eyes, was sublime as the crazy neo-Nazi author, and when one of his pigeons gave the ""heil"" salute, I went over the edge.Some of the music I could have done without, but never mind.
