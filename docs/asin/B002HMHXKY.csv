I,ve seen several of the gospel singers perform there and what a enjoyable night. Jason Crabb is with the Gaithers and we stayed an extra week to see him perform.This video has so many wonderful songs and the way they perform. Straight from their hearts and souls,glad I was turned on to gospel by watching the Gaither Family.Its like hearing Angels sing......I will keep on listening and watching these  wonderful singers as they keep performing.",5,I love Nashville,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,532,"['have', 'been', 'Grand', 'Old', 'Opry', 'was', 'awesome', 'terrific', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'fun', 've', 'seen', 'several', 'gospel', 'singers', 'perform', 'there', 'what', 'enjoyable', 'night', 'Jason', 'Crabb', 'Gaithers', 'stayed', 'extra', 'week', 'see', 'perform.This', 'video', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'way', 'perform', 'Straight', 'hearts', 'souls', 'glad', 'was', 'turned', 'gospel', 'watching', 'Gaither', 'Family.Its', 'hearing', 'Angels', 'sing', 'will', 'keep', 'listening', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'singers', 'keep', 'performing']",N/A

I bought this, looking for a certain song, which turned out to be on another DVD, -blue grass no less. (Oh well, got it!) Even so, I am not at all disappointed with this DVD. The title gave me clue, so the ""Opry"" flavor was not a surprise. If you enjoy country, you will enjoy this. Or, if you are like me, you will just take it for what it is, and enjoy having something a bit different. After all, The Grand Old Opry has been around for many decades, and some folks think it is the best of the best. So!
