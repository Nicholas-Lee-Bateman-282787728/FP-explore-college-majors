Hoffmann story Nu&szlig;knacker und Mausek&ouml;nig will recognize that its period setting, major themes and characters remain mostly intact. Many of the characters' lines, actions, and dilemmas are lifted straight from the original. Well done! Even Tchaikovsky's music written for the famous ballet was not too severely rearranged.Some melding with the ballet was done, with generally good results. There of course had to be some story trimming here & there, and some sugar-coating to keep the story and action kid-friendly and not too frightening by the sensibilities of the day. Today, 25 years after its production, the PC crowd would probably deem it too violent and threatening--there's weapons like swords & cannons fer gosh sake! Oh the horror! At least Clara is still a scrapper, if not more so than Marie in the original.The only quibble is that the story has the obligatory ""I can't stay in fairyland"" resolution that has been plaguing kid-fantasy adaptations since the Baum-to-MGM rewrite of ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" and the like.

493787,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B000006FY9,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[2, 2]","Please look past the awful cover and you will find a true gem of an animated movie, with great characters and animation. Produced by now defunct Canadian studio Lacewood Productions, this adaptation of the classic ballet takes a quite different approach to the story than the ballet. This is an exciting, involving story that can be enjoyed on many levels. It's also perfect family viewing; girls will be enthralled by the love story, boys will love the Mouse King. If I am to look past target audiences, though, this film just works amazingly.The Nutcracker Prince tells of Claire, the young girl of an upper-class rural German speaking home (in which country the story takes place is never made clear). Family friend, ""uncle"" Drosselmeier, a renowned craftsman, gives Claire a nutcracker at the family's Christmas party. He tells her the story of how a young man was cursed by the evil Mouse Queen for helping a beautiful princess, and that only by defeating her son, the Mouse King, can he become human again. The following two nights, Claire learns that there's more to this story than just fairytale.Let me make one thing plain; Phyllis Diller's role in this movie is NOT big. The Mouse Queen only appears for about five minutes of the film. It's not fair that her name is on the cover and not the one of Mike MacDonald, the voice of the Mouse King, when he is one of the movie's biggest roles. Because let's face it, the star of this film is the Mouse King. He is vile, repugnant and ugly. Yet in a true demonstration of the power of animation, he is absolutely amazing; a nonstop powerhouse of cruel laughs and evil intentions, quite content on threatening to kill Claire's kitten if she doesn't surrender the Nutcracker to him. There are a number of scary scenes with the Mouse King, and his interaction with Claire is practically the driving force of the film. It's also funny how he contrasts his bumbling, incompetent mouse troops.It's interesting how this film has two animation styles. One of those only features for about ten minutes, telling the tale of the Nutcracker's origin, where the whole look is very stylised, but still lively and appealing (modern tv networks would find a lot of helpful tips from this section). The other, then, is my favourite; lively and flowing, and especially relishing in the case of the Mouse King. All of his present day scenes are divine in their beauty (even though he certainly isn't). Mike MacDonald's voice performance clinches the deal; he is scary and threatening, and bursting with personality.Of course the timeless Nutcracker music is to be found here, even adorned with lyrics in the beautiful ""If You Could Hear Me Now"". There are some strong supporting roles, such as the aged colonel and Claire's vain doll. Mostly, though, this film belongs to Claire, the Nutcracker and the Mouse King. This is a wonderful family film that can be enjoyed on many levels, visually and in terms of story, characters and moral. So basically, this is an excellent movie.",5,"""Long Live the Mouse King!""",1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,3014,"['Please', 'look', 'awful', 'cover', 'will', 'find', 'true', 'gem', 'animated', 'movie', 'great', 'characters', 'animation', 'Produced', 'now', 'defunct', 'Canadian', 'studio', 'Lacewood', 'Productions', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'ballet', 'quite', 'different', 'approach', 'story', 'ballet', 'exciting', 'involving', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'levels', 'also', 'perfect', 'family', 'viewing', 'girls', 'will', 'be', 'enthralled', 'love', 'story', 'boys', 'will', 'love', 'Mouse', 'King', 'am', 'look', 'past', 'target', 'audiences', 'though', 'film', 'just', 'amazingly.The', 'Nutcracker', 'Prince', 'tells', 'Claire', 'young', 'girl', 'upper-class', 'rural', 'German', 'speaking', 'home', 'country', 'story', 'place', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'Family', 'friend', 'uncle', 'Drosselmeier', 'renowned', 'craftsman', 'Claire', 'nutcracker', 'family', 'Christmas', 'party', 'story', 'how', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'cursed', 'evil', 'Mouse', 'Queen', 'helping', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'only', 'defeating', 'son', 'Mouse', 'King', 'can', 'become', 'human', 'again', 'following', 'two', 'nights', 'Claire', 'more', 'story', 'just', 'fairytale.Let', 'make', 'one', 'thing', 'plain', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'role', 'movie', 'NOT', 'big', 'Mouse', 'Queen', 'only', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'not', 'fair', 'name', 'cover', 'not', 'one', 'Mike', 'MacDonald', 'voice', 'Mouse', 'King', 'when', 'one', 'movie', 'biggest', 'roles', 'let', 'face', 'star', 'film', 'Mouse', 'King', 'vile', 'repugnant', 'ugly', 'true', 'demonstration', 'power', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'nonstop', 'powerhouse', 'cruel', 'laughs', 'evil', 'intentions', 'quite', 'content', 'threatening', 'kill', 'Claire', 'kitten', ""n't"", 'surrender', 'Nutcracker', 'are', 'number', 'scary', 'scenes', 'Mouse', 'King', 'interaction', 'Claire', 'practically', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'also', 'funny', 'how', 'bumbling', 'incompetent', 'mouse', 'troops.It', 'interesting', 'how', 'film', 'two', 'animation', 'styles', 'One', 'only', 'features', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'telling', 'tale', 'Nutcracker', 'origin', 'where', 'whole', 'look', 'very', 'stylised', 'still', 'lively', 'appealing', 'modern', 'tv', 'networks', 'would', 'find', 'lot', 'helpful', 'tips', 'section', 'other', 'then', 'favourite', 'lively', 'flowing', 'especially', 'relishing', 'case', 'Mouse', 'King', 'present', 'day', 'scenes', 'are', 'divine', 'beauty', 'even', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Mike', 'MacDonald', 'voice', 'performance', 'deal', 'scary', 'threatening', 'bursting', 'personality.Of', 'course', 'timeless', 'Nutcracker', 'music', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'even', 'adorned', 'lyrics', 'beautiful', 'Could', 'Hear', 'Me', 'Now', 'are', 'strong', 'supporting', 'roles', 'such', 'aged', 'colonel', 'Claire', 'vain', 'doll', 'Mostly', 'though', 'film', 'Claire', 'Nutcracker', 'Mouse', 'King', 'wonderful', 'family', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'levels', 'visually', 'terms', 'story', 'characters', 'moral', 'So', 'basically', 'excellent', 'movie']",The Nutcracker Prince VHS

493791,A2KSRJFZ2R9JK3,B000006FY9,Fuwwyfootpaws,"[0, 0]","The Nutcracker Prince is a Christmas movie from 1990. It is based on the story ''The Nutcracker And The Mouseking'' by E.T.A. Hoffmann.The film is about a girl named Clara who gets a nutcracker doll from her uncle on Christmas Eve. He then tells her a story about how the Prince was turned into a nutcracker by the Mousequeen. In his story, we see a lot of goofy scenes with the characters, and after the Prince is turned into a nutcracker, the Mousequeen is then crushed and killed. Her son then takes over and becomes the Mouseking.After Clara's uncle finishes his story, Clara is upset by how sad it ends, but her uncle tells her it's not so sad, because the nuctracker will someday get married and rule in the land of the dolls.During the night, Clara begins to fall in love with the nutcracker doll, and she starts singing and dancing with the doll in her hands. Then her uncle magically appears, and makes all the dolls in the room come to life. Clara is then attacked by the Mouseking. The Mouseking bullies her and demands that she give him the nutcracker. There are then several scenes where the dolls are being attacked by the Mouseking's army of mice. The dolls fight back, and the nutcracker battles with the Mouseking on top of a Christmas Tree. The nutcracker stabs the Mouseking, who then falls off the Christmas Tree. Everyone cheers, and then the nutcracker brings Clara to the land of the dolls. They dance together, and the nuctracker asks her if she would like to be his princess. She doesn't know what to say, but she tells them that she doesn't belong there, and that this is a place where only the dolls should live. She tells them that she wants to live her life in the real world. The dolls then all start turning back into real dolls. Clara tries to reason with them, but then she turns around, and she is attacked by the dying Mouseking who is holding his stabbed wound. She tries to fend him off as the nutcracker turns into a doll, the Mouseking then falls off the edge of the castle. Everyone disappears and Clara is left alone. Then Clara wakes up from her dream, and her brother comes into the room telling her that their dad caught a big mouse.Clara then goes downstairs and notices that the nutcracker doll is gone. She runs to her uncle's house, and she is really confused. She tells him that she must know if the nutcracker is real or not. Then her uncle's nephew comes into the room, and he looks identical to the nutcracker. He introduces himself, then the movie ends with Clara smiling and saying ''Hello, nutcracker''.I really like this movie. It's a colorful movie with lots of funny scenes and several dramatic and romantic scenes as well.

I saw it years ago on the Disney Channel and loved it, now my family watch it every Christams. I always loved the story of Clara and the Nutcracker but could never get into ballet. Sure ballet is nice to watch for the first several minutes to everything starts looking like it's repeated over and over. This movie has the plot with the Prince turning into the Nutcracker, the battle scene with the Mice and toys and the confrontation with the Nutcracker and the Mouse King (who I think is the best animated character, and Clara's journey into Toy land without all the endless jumping up and down. There is one scene where the Prince and Clara dance in the land of the dolla which is well done with the music too. The ending is great and it should be played every year! I love it so much I wrote a ""sequel"" which is posted on fanfiction and the director of the movie is going to read it!So all in all, this movie of the story is the best way also to introduce others to the story of the girl and her nutcracker prince.

It seems to be quite beloved by those who grew up with it. Personally, I watch a lot of animation, and I am not totally blown away by this particular feature. Animation wise, it leaves a lot to be desired, though it is not terrible. The voice acting varies. We all love Kiefer Sutherland, but he is rather bland in the title role of this film. Megan Follows as Clara is not bad at all. The story tries to be pretty close to the original Nutcracker story by E.T.A. Hoffmann, and it is really good in this regard (this may throw off those who are only familiar with the ballet though). I guess when you combine that with the beautiful music by Tchaikovsky, you can forgive the film for having mediocre, or at least uneven animation (and I'm not talking about how the Princess Pirlipat sequence is done in a different style; I get and enjoy that). Overall, this is no Disney Renaissance feature, but it does manage to be a charming little holiday film for when you're in that Nutcracker mood but not ready for the full on ballet version. For that, though it is very unique, I recommend &#34;Nutcracker: The Motion Picture&#34;, the version featuring the Pacific Northwest Ballet with designs by illustator Maurice Sendak.Now, a word about this DVD release. We are given The Nutcracker Prince on DVD from Goodtimes Entertainment, and it is not exactly a spectacular release. There are no bonus features, and the film is in fullscreen. I don't know what the original aspect ratio was, but surely it was widescreen. I hear overseas releases came with the trailer, but we get none here. Hopefully, this film will get a Blu-Ray release someday that at least addresses those issues.",4,A sweet little Nutcracker film.,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,2363,"['Clara', 'young', 'girl', '19th', 'century', 'nutcracker', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'party', 'very', 'attached', 'mysterious', 'magical', 'godfather', 'Uncle', 'Drosselmeier', 'fairytale-like', 'story', 'how', 'Nutcracker', 'came', 'be', 'later', 'night', 'own', 'encounter', 'villain', 'story', 'evil', 'Mouse', 'King', 'Nutcracker', 'life', 'defend', 'Clara', 'dolls', 'first', 'battle', 'Clara', 'injured', 'Later', 'battle', 'Clara', 'whisked', 'away', 'land', 'dolls', 'everything', 'finally', 'put', 'right', 'again', '34', 'Nutcracker', 'Prince', '34', 'animated', 'feature', '1990', 'released', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'be', 'quite', 'beloved', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Personally', 'watch', 'lot', 'animation', 'am', 'not', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'particular', 'feature', 'Animation', 'wise', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'not', 'terrible', 'voice', 'acting', 'varies', 'love', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'rather', 'bland', 'title', 'role', 'film', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'Clara', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'be', 'pretty', 'close', 'original', 'Nutcracker', 'story', 'E.T.A', 'Hoffmann', 'really', 'good', 'regard', 'may', 'throw', 'off', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'familiar', 'ballet', 'guess', 'when', 'combine', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Tchaikovsky', 'can', 'forgive', 'film', 'having', 'mediocre', 'least', 'uneven', 'animation', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'how', 'Princess', 'Pirlipat', 'sequence', 'done', 'different', 'style', 'get', 'enjoy', 'Overall', 'Disney', 'Renaissance', 'feature', 'manage', 'be', 'charming', 'little', 'holiday', 'film', 'when', ""'re"", 'Nutcracker', 'mood', 'not', 'ready', 'full', 'ballet', 'version', 'very', 'unique', 'recommend', '34', 'Nutcracker', 'Motion', 'Picture', '34', 'version', 'featuring', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'Ballet', 'designs', 'illustator', 'Maurice', 'Sendak.Now', 'word', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'given', 'Nutcracker', 'Prince', 'DVD', 'Goodtimes', 'Entertainment', 'not', 'exactly', 'spectacular', 'release', 'are', 'bonus', 'film', 'fullscreen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'was', 'surely', 'was', 'widescreen', 'hear', 'overseas', 'releases', 'came', 'trailer', 'get', 'none', 'here', 'Hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'someday', 'least', 'addresses', 'issues']",The Nutcracker Prince VHS

I agree with the other reviewers about the not so top notch animation ; however the story line was intriguing. It is a bit different when comparing it to Tchaikovsky's ballet. This portrayal of the Christmas classic comes close to E.T.A. Hoffman's book ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King."" (If you love the ""Nutcracker"" you should go read it.  The best translation is by  Ralph Manheim  and illustrator by Maurice Sendak. Go check it out!)  You have the leading character, Clara (Megan Fellows ""Anne of Green Gables""), an adolescent girl who wants to hold on to her childhood.  Nutcracker (Keiffer Sutherland), a young prince of the toys, who is cursed to live his life as a nutcracker.  Uncle Drosselmier (I have no idea who play's this character) who is the instigator of Clara's and Nutcrackers meeting.  Also, a handful of colorful supporting characters (the mouse queen played by  Phylis Diller) that makes the story a delight to watch.  Through out the story they have dance scenes and used Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker"" music as background music.  What I mostly enjoyed in the movie is Clara's struggle to figure out what her true dreams are and whether to live in a fantasy world or face adulthood.  The ending also leaves us questioning if Clara's adventures with her Nutcracker Prince was a dream or reality. Older children (as well as adults) will enjoy this movie.  What I mean by older children (8 yrs and up)  is that there is a bit of fighting and death scenes.  Other than that,  it's a great movie to watch during the holidays!",5,Wonderful Holiday Treat,1041379200,"01 1, 2003",2003,1685,"['When', 'was', 'eleven', 'remember', 'watching', 'version', 'Nutcracker', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'video', 'fell', 'completely', 'love', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'not', 'so', 'top', 'notch', 'animation', 'however', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'intriguing', 'bit', 'different', 'when', 'comparing', 'Tchaikovsky', 'ballet', 'portrayal', 'Christmas', 'classic', 'close', 'E.T.A', 'Hoffman', 'book', 'Nutcracker', 'Mouse', 'King', 'love', 'Nutcracker', 'should', 'go', 'read', 'best', 'translation', 'Ralph', 'Manheim', 'illustrator', 'Maurice', 'Sendak', 'Go', 'check', 'out', 'have', 'leading', 'character', 'Clara', 'Megan', 'Fellows', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'who', 'hold', 'childhood', 'Nutcracker', 'Keiffer', 'Sutherland', 'young', 'prince', 'toys', 'who', 'cursed', 'live', 'life', 'nutcracker', 'Uncle', 'Drosselmier', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'play', 'character', 'who', 'instigator', 'Clara', 'Nutcrackers', 'meeting', 'Also', 'handful', 'colorful', 'supporting', 'characters', 'mouse', 'queen', 'played', 'Phylis', 'Diller', 'story', 'delight', 'watch', 'story', 'have', 'dance', 'scenes', 'used', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Nutcracker', 'music', 'background', 'music', 'What', 'mostly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Clara', 'struggle', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'true', 'dreams', 'are', 'live', 'fantasy', 'world', 'face', 'adulthood', 'ending', 'also', 'questioning', 'Clara', 'adventures', 'Nutcracker', 'Prince', 'was', 'dream', 'reality', 'Older', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'What', 'mean', 'older', 'children', '8', 'yrs', 'up', 'bit', 'fighting', 'death', 'scenes', 'Other', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'holidays']",The Nutcracker Prince VHS

I'm glad it's available on DVD now so that I can share it with my preschooler. We watched it this afternoon and I was happy that the magic of the story and animation is still there, and my preschooler loved it too. This version of the Nutcracker remains more faithful to the E.T.A. Hoffmann's version of the story.Young Clara (voiced by Megan Fellows of ""Anne of Green Gables"") receives a wooden nutcracker at Christmas from toymaker Drosselmeier, who regales her with the story of how the nutcracker came to be the way he is. That very night, Clara has dreams about a fantastical battle between the Nutcracker Prince (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) and the evil Mouse King, and the outcome is one that not only affects the Nutcracker's freedom but young Clara's future as well. The accompanying music by Tchaikovsky enhances the animation and makes it all the more magical.  The themes explored include those of courage, loyalty, and sacrifice. This is a family friendly feature that will entertain both children and adults.
