None of these events is connected to the events of the series.This is a inspiring and powerful story.The Rangers were six young warriors entrusted with super powers, battle armor, magic weapons and battle vehicles.For years they'd protected their world from Zed and Rita, a Demonic Being and his evil Sorceress bride.At the beginning Zed unleashes an ancient evil, Ivon Ooze.

Long ago I have seen snippets and parts of this film and it seemed intriguing. And, yes, if  you don't mind the characters, what is left of the film is quite enticing -  a primeval world, an ancient shrine, a run for an ancient weapon, that is  all fine and interesting, even semi-epic at times. But the characters, the  plot, the acting, and especially the script merge to create the perfect  dead film not dissimilar from Plan 9 from Outer Space, only with better  special effects. The special effects themselves are quite outdated, the  shapes having no skins attached, merely chrome-like colors.

384671,A22JR9ROYRPN7P,6303675220,ANAN KHALIQUE,"[1, 1]","I've wanted to review this. But since I no longer had the VHS, I was not able to until now as I saw the movie on youtube. It has since been taken down so thank God I saved it.Just like I did with the Power Rangers Turbo movie, I made notes while watching. And to be honest, there is more good here than bad.The opening was a good one. Some of it was very predictable though. For instance, Billy, the whiz of the team gave a perfect landing. Rocky, the Red Ranger landed right on target, which was also red. Another thing that has always been predictable about the Power Rangers is also present throughout the movie and that is their clothes. Tommy wore all white, Adam had black clothes, Kim had pink shorts, Aisha had yellow shorts, etc. I understand this is done so the younger audience can have a easier time identifying who is what Power Ranger color so it's ok with me. After all, it helped me back in the day lol. I mean, who didn't it help? Also, they lose their powers RIGHT AFTER they finish off Ivan's kids. Not anytime before or during the fight lol.Everyone had parachutes. But Tommy is the only one who had a surfboard and it was awesome. As usual, Bulk & Skull were funny especially when they jumped out of the plane lol.I loved the first time Ivan met the Rangers as Ivan was pretty funny in that scene. The two fight scenes where they took on his ""kids"" were also cool as cool likes were said. Tommy's ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" line was awesome. But a lot of the funny lines during the fight scenes came from Adam. When he & Rocky, as Rangers worked together on them, some great lines were said by them. A lot of Ivan's lines in the film are funny. Things get emotionally deep when the Rangers enter the broken Command Center and see a dying Zordon. The Tengu Warriors make their first appearance here as they attack The Rangers who are on a distant planet to get The Great Power. They are saved by Dulcea, who also the narrator in the prologue that was shown and heard before the film began. Sometime after, she tells them about the Ninjetti power and tells each of them which Zord is theirs. Listen for Adam's line. I got the feeling that he wasn't acting and was legitimately upset. I would be too if I was him.The music was good. But that doesn't surprise me as the man who composed MMPR score also composed the epic Crow score.What I didn't like:1. The look of Zedd, Goldar, Zordon, Alpha, the Command Center, The Ninja Megazord and the Power Ranger costumes although Aisha's light and Rocky's camera are awesome. Wish we could see what the other Rangers could do with their costumes. But they should have sicked to the original2. First and only appearance of Mordant. What bothered me is that anytime before or after the movie, he was not seen, heard from, nor mentioned ever.3. The Morphing Sequence - This is before the fight Ivan's ""kids"" in the building. The music made it worse. Again, this should have stuck with the original.4. Adam's Ninjazord. This carried on in the series.Overall, a fun film. A great one for Power Ranger fans.",5,IT'S MORPHIN TIME!,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,3060,"[""'ve"", 'wanted', 'review', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'VHS', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'now', 'saw', 'movie', 'youtube', 'been', 'taken', 'down', 'so', 'thank', 'God', 'saved', 'it.Just', 'did', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Turbo', 'movie', 'made', 'notes', 'watching', 'be', 'honest', 'more', 'good', 'here', 'bad.The', 'opening', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'predictable', 'though', 'instance', 'Billy', 'whiz', 'team', 'gave', 'perfect', 'landing', 'Rocky', 'Red', 'Ranger', 'landed', 'right', 'target', 'was', 'also', 'red', 'thing', 'always', 'been', 'predictable', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'also', 'present', 'movie', 'clothes', 'Tommy', 'white', 'Adam', 'had', 'black', 'clothes', 'Kim', 'had', 'pink', 'shorts', 'Aisha', 'had', 'yellow', 'shorts', 'etc', 'understand', 'done', 'so', 'younger', 'audience', 'can', 'have', 'easier', 'time', 'identifying', 'who', 'what', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'color', 'ok', 'helped', 'back', 'day', 'lol', 'mean', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Also', 'lose', 'powers', 'RIGHT', 'AFTER', 'finish', 'off', 'Ivan', 'kids', 'Not', 'anytime', 'fight', 'lol.Everyone', 'had', 'parachutes', 'Tommy', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'surfboard', 'was', 'awesome', 'usual', 'Bulk', 'Skull', 'were', 'funny', 'especially', 'when', 'jumped', 'plane', 'lol.I', 'loved', 'first', 'time', 'Ivan', 'met', 'Rangers', 'Ivan', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'scene', 'two', 'fight', 'scenes', 'where', 'took', 'kids', 'were', 'also', 'cool', 'cool', 'likes', 'were', 'said', 'Tommy', 'Welcome', 'My', 'Nightmare', 'line', 'was', 'awesome', 'lot', 'funny', 'lines', 'fight', 'scenes', 'came', 'Adam', 'When', 'Rocky', 'Rangers', 'worked', 'together', 'great', 'lines', 'were', 'said', 'lot', 'Ivan', 'lines', 'film', 'are', 'funny', 'Things', 'get', 'emotionally', 'deep', 'when', 'Rangers', 'enter', 'broken', 'Command', 'Center', 'see', 'dying', 'Zordon', 'Tengu', 'Warriors', 'make', 'first', 'appearance', 'here', 'attack', 'Rangers', 'who', 'are', 'distant', 'planet', 'get', 'Great', 'Power', 'are', 'saved', 'Dulcea', 'who', 'also', 'narrator', 'prologue', 'was', 'shown', 'heard', 'film', 'began', 'Sometime', 'Ninjetti', 'power', 'Zord', 'theirs', 'Listen', 'Adam', 'line', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'was', 'legitimately', 'upset', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'was', 'him.The', 'music', 'was', 'good', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'man', 'who', 'composed', 'MMPR', 'score', 'also', 'composed', 'epic', 'Crow', 'score.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like:1', 'look', 'Zedd', 'Goldar', 'Zordon', 'Alpha', 'Command', 'Center', 'Ninja', 'Megazord', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'Aisha', 'light', 'Rocky', 'camera', 'are', 'awesome', 'Wish', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'Rangers', 'could', 'do', 'costumes', 'should', 'have', 'sicked', 'original2', 'First', 'only', 'appearance', 'Mordant', 'What', 'bothered', 'anytime', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'seen', 'heard', 'mentioned', 'ever.3', 'Morphing', 'Sequence', 'fight', 'Ivan', 'kids', 'building', 'music', 'made', 'worse', 'Again', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'original.4', 'Adam', 'Ninjazord', 'carried', 'series.Overall', 'fun', 'film', 'great', 'one', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'fans']",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie VHS

384674,A1C7OW2QBJKU6J,6303675220,Brooks Austin,"[5, 6]","Power Rangers originated in Japan as a series of live-action television shows known as Super Sentai beginning with the series Go Ranger in the '70s.  The show has been a hugely popular success with a new series set in a different alternate universe each year, introducing a new storyline with entirely new characters.  In the early '90s, Saban bought the rights to the footage of Zyu Ranger, the '92 Super Sentai series, but rather than simply dubbing it into English, they combined the Japanese fight scene footage with new, original American footage to re-create this series as the Power Rangers.  While each new series in Japan took place in a different altnernate universe, Saban used the same characters and timeline for each season of the American adaption up until Lost Galaxy, while introducing various new characters throughout the show.Despite how much of a bad idea this adaption sounds now, it actually worked!  Power Rangers was a hit and all the kids loved it.  I doubt you could find any kid who could even tell that Power Rangers was a Japanese show when they first watched it.  And the changes Saban made to the series were creative enough to make Power Rangers a show worth-viewing on its own.  However, for the Rangers' first feature film, this movie was not an adaption of a Japanese film, but rather it was an entirely original American production.  The plot for this movie is pretty simplistic.  An evil bad guy wants to destroy the Earth and it's up to the Power Rangers to stop him.  With a storyline this repetitive and predictable, I have to give this movie one star, right?  Despite its predictableness, I have to give this movie four stars because it takes such a predictable storyline and has fun with it!  Power Rangers: The Movie is a wonderful film with lots of great action, humorous dialog, and great characters, who while may seem stereotypical today, you can't help but to admit you loved to death as a kid.  Perhaps the most impressive thing about this movie are the special effects.  While the CGI for this movie may seem outdated and cheesy compared to the movies of today, they were quite good for the time of this movie's release, and lightyears ahead of the special effects of the TV show.  Even when compared to the newer episodes of Power Rangers on television today, the special effects for this movie still outshines them.Even though this movie is more like an extended episode of the TV show, it's one of those rare movies where the kids will actually stay still while watching it the entire time and that's a miracle in itself!  And Ivan Ooze is probably one of the coolest children's movie villians ever!  The only reason why I have to give this movie four stars instead of five is because it's out of the continuity of the TV series.  The TV show doesn't even acknowledge that anything that happens in this movie even existed, the movie pretty much forgets about any of Rita's henchmen from the TV show, and it introduces us to this new pig bad guy and assumes that we've known who he was all along, even though he never appeared once in the series.  Still, Power Rangers: The Movie is just a fun film and it's certainly a lot better than most of the crap airing on children's Saturday morning television today.  Highly recommended, especially to Power Rangers fans and kids.",4,A classic children's action film.,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,3325,"['Power', 'Rangers', 'originated', 'Japan', 'series', 'live-action', 'television', 'shows', 'known', 'Super', 'Sentai', 'beginning', 'series', 'Go', 'Ranger', ""'70s"", 'show', 'been', 'hugely', 'popular', 'success', 'new', 'series', 'set', 'different', 'alternate', 'universe', 'year', 'introducing', 'new', 'storyline', 'entirely', 'new', 'characters', 'early', ""'90s"", 'Saban', 'bought', 'rights', 'footage', 'Zyu', 'Ranger', ""'92"", 'Super', 'Sentai', 'series', 'rather', 'simply', 'dubbing', 'English', 'combined', 'Japanese', 'fight', 'scene', 'footage', 'new', 'original', 'American', 'footage', 're-create', 'series', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'new', 'series', 'Japan', 'took', 'place', 'different', 'altnernate', 'universe', 'Saban', 'used', 'same', 'characters', 'timeline', 'season', 'American', 'adaption', 'up', 'Lost', 'Galaxy', 'introducing', 'various', 'new', 'characters', 'show.Despite', 'how', 'much', 'bad', 'idea', 'adaption', 'now', 'actually', 'worked', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'was', 'hit', 'kids', 'loved', 'doubt', 'could', 'find', 'kid', 'who', 'could', 'even', 'tell', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'was', 'Japanese', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'changes', 'Saban', 'made', 'series', 'were', 'creative', 'enough', 'make', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'show', 'worth-viewing', 'own', 'However', 'Rangers', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'adaption', 'Japanese', 'film', 'rather', 'was', 'entirely', 'original', 'American', 'production', 'plot', 'movie', 'pretty', 'simplistic', 'evil', 'bad', 'guy', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'up', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'stop', 'storyline', 'repetitive', 'predictable', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'right', 'predictableness', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'fun', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'wonderful', 'film', 'lots', 'great', 'action', 'humorous', 'dialog', 'great', 'characters', 'who', 'may', 'seem', 'stereotypical', 'today', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admit', 'loved', 'death', 'kid', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'movie', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'outdated', 'cheesy', 'compared', 'movies', 'today', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'time', 'movie', 'release', 'ahead', 'special', 'effects', 'TV', 'show', 'Even', 'when', 'compared', 'newer', 'episodes', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'television', 'today', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'still', 'them.Even', 'movie', 'more', 'extended', 'episode', 'TV', 'show', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'where', 'kids', 'will', 'actually', 'stay', 'still', 'watching', 'entire', 'time', 'miracle', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'probably', 'one', 'coolest', 'children', 'movie', 'ever', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'continuity', 'TV', 'series', 'TV', 'show', ""n't"", 'even', 'acknowledge', 'anything', 'movie', 'even', 'existed', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgets', 'Rita', 'henchmen', 'TV', 'show', 'new', 'pig', 'bad', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'known', 'who', 'was', 'all', 'along', 'even', 'never', 'appeared', 'once', 'series', 'Still', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'just', 'fun', 'film', 'certainly', 'lot', 'better', 'most', 'crap', 'airing', 'children', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'television', 'today', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'especially', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'fans', 'kids']",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie VHS
384675,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,6303675220,Caleb Williams,"[6, 6]","Now like most kids, I loved the Power Rangers, I loved the intense martial arts fights and the general good feeling of good always winning over evil. Today I can still look back on past episodes not with general nostalgia, but as a viewer of today and call it childish but I can still say the Mighty Morphin was the best rangers generation. Although you generally knew that the Rangers would always win out against the bad guy, it was always made in a way in which would have you thinking ""well maybe they wont pull through this time"". It's a genuinely fun and cool show for the kids and the big kid in all of us who struggles to hold onto the past.The story focuses around a mysterious egg prison found in a building site, it's opened by Rita and Lord Zedd to release the evil Ivan Ooze. Ooze was locked away by Zordon 6 thousand years ago and now Ooze is seeking revenge, he destroys the crystaline chamber keeping Zordon alive and is what provided the rangers with their power. Now, the rangers must set on a quest on an ancient planet to unlock a secret power which will help save Zordon and the universe.The Power Rangers was never a show about great action or complete fantasy, it was a show that gave a great message about friendship and self belief. It always had the underlining message about sticking by those you care about and defending those in trouble. It did this in my mind without being too cheesy or too insulting to the child's intelligence. They portray this message superbly in this movie and as always places that along side some great action.The special effects of this movie are, for the time amazing and it clearly has a much bigger budget than its TV counterpart. The zord animations aren't perfect but are much preferred to the traditional man in a crazy suit in a model city. It is cool and Ivan Ooze makes for a great one off evil villain that is so evil even locks away Rita and lord Zedd. A great movie all around, it isn't something that new fans will enjoy as it's very much a film for the fans of the traditional series. To those now too old to call themselves rangers fans simply because it makes you seem creepy, it's something that can give you an enjoyable nostalgia feel.",5,I Miss My Childhood,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,2210,"['Now', 'most', 'kids', 'loved', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'loved', 'intense', 'martial', 'arts', 'fights', 'general', 'good', 'feeling', 'good', 'always', 'winning', 'over', 'evil', 'Today', 'can', 'still', 'look', 'back', 'past', 'episodes', 'not', 'general', 'nostalgia', 'viewer', 'today', 'call', 'childish', 'can', 'still', 'say', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'was', 'best', 'rangers', 'generation', 'generally', 'knew', 'Rangers', 'would', 'always', 'win', 'out', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'always', 'made', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'thinking', 'well', 'maybe', 'wont', 'pull', 'time', 'genuinely', 'fun', 'cool', 'show', 'kids', 'big', 'kid', 'who', 'hold', 'past.The', 'story', 'mysterious', 'egg', 'prison', 'found', 'building', 'site', 'opened', 'Rita', 'Lord', 'Zedd', 'release', 'evil', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'Ooze', 'was', 'locked', 'away', 'Zordon', '6', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'Ooze', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'crystaline', 'chamber', 'keeping', 'Zordon', 'alive', 'what', 'provided', 'rangers', 'power', 'Now', 'rangers', 'must', 'set', 'quest', 'ancient', 'planet', 'unlock', 'secret', 'power', 'will', 'help', 'save', 'Zordon', 'universe.The', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'was', 'never', 'show', 'great', 'action', 'complete', 'fantasy', 'was', 'show', 'gave', 'great', 'message', 'friendship', 'self', 'belief', 'always', 'had', 'underlining', 'message', 'sticking', 'care', 'defending', 'trouble', 'did', 'mind', 'being', 'too', 'cheesy', 'too', 'insulting', 'child', 'intelligence', 'portray', 'message', 'superbly', 'movie', 'always', 'side', 'great', 'action.The', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'time', 'amazing', 'clearly', 'much', 'bigger', 'budget', 'TV', 'counterpart', 'zord', 'animations', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'are', 'much', 'preferred', 'traditional', 'man', 'crazy', 'suit', 'model', 'city', 'cool', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'great', 'one', 'evil', 'villain', 'so', 'evil', 'even', 'away', 'Rita', 'lord', 'Zedd', 'A', 'great', 'movie', 'around', ""n't"", 'something', 'new', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'fans', 'traditional', 'series', 'now', 'too', 'old', 'call', 'rangers', 'fans', 'simply', 'seem', 'creepy', 'something', 'can', 'give', 'enjoyable', 'nostalgia', 'feel']",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie VHS

384678,A239PPUVV8O0U0,6303675220,D. A. Reed,"[0, 0]","It seems like yesterday that my family and I went to see the big screen adaptation of MMPR. I even remember owning all of the promotional McDonald's toys and owning the toy of the Ninja Megazord (the TV version). But anyway, in this action-packed film (with an actual budget and no Super Sentai footage to be found) Rita and Zedd release intergalactic super-villain Ivan Ooze (played by Paul Freeman of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""). Can the Rangers beat this new and dangerous threat? Well I don't like spoiling movies so you'll just have to watch it. It was great to see the same actors (minus the original Red, Black and Yellow Rangers) And it was just amazing to have a villain of great power who got rid of the two most popular Ranger villains in the first act of the film. While I love the movie, I just have a few problems, first: Ooze should've created a monster with Rita and Zedd (that's what they were known for creating/growing monsters) to attack the Rangers. They could've used the Thunderzords but have them destroyed in the process of the battle, along with their powers. This take was adapted into the season three 4-part opener ""Ninja Quest"" of the series, which has no continuity with this film as in the series, their powers come from Ninjor, not Dulcea as shown in the film. Second: for a quest to obtain the Great Power, it was pretty short. They get the ninja suits, go through a forest and fight a skeleton dinosaur and BOOM! They're at the temple! Third: where the heck are Baboo, Squatt and Finster? They get replaced and get no mention. Mordant is treated as if he's always been there since day one. And fourth: I hate the kid! I know this was a kids movie and they wanted someone for the kids to identify with but I have never been a real fan of kid actors in film (except the original Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, Temple of Doom and Blues Brothers 2000 [but that took many viewings for me to even tolerate Buster.]) And how the heck does a kid his age know how to operate a monorail and a crane? Despite those few minor problems, I have no problem with this movie. Its pure entertainment that will keep the kids occupied for an hour and a half.",5,Nostalgic Memories of My Childhood,1240444800,"04 23, 2009",2009,2179,"['yesterday', 'family', 'went', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'MMPR', 'even', 'remember', 'owning', 'promotional', 'McDonald', 'toys', 'owning', 'toy', 'Ninja', 'Megazord', 'TV', 'version', 'anyway', 'action-packed', 'film', 'actual', 'budget', 'Super', 'Sentai', 'footage', 'be', 'found', 'Rita', 'Zedd', 'release', 'intergalactic', 'super-villain', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'played', 'Paul', 'Freeman', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Can', 'Rangers', 'beat', 'new', 'dangerous', 'threat', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'spoiling', 'movies', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'same', 'actors', 'original', 'Red', 'Black', 'Yellow', 'Rangers', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'have', 'villain', 'great', 'power', 'who', 'got', 'rid', 'two', 'most', 'popular', 'Ranger', 'villains', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'few', 'problems', 'first', 'Ooze', 'should', ""'ve"", 'created', 'monster', 'Rita', 'Zedd', 'what', 'were', 'known', 'creating/growing', 'monsters', 'attack', 'Rangers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'Thunderzords', 'have', 'destroyed', 'process', 'battle', 'powers', 'take', 'was', 'adapted', 'season', 'three', '4-part', 'opener', 'Ninja', 'Quest', 'series', 'continuity', 'film', 'series', 'powers', 'come', 'Ninjor', 'not', 'Dulcea', 'shown', 'film', 'Second', 'quest', 'obtain', 'Great', 'Power', 'was', 'pretty', 'short', 'get', 'ninja', 'suits', 'go', 'forest', 'fight', 'skeleton', 'dinosaur', 'BOOM', ""'re"", 'temple', 'Third', 'where', 'heck', 'are', 'Baboo', 'Squatt', 'Finster', 'get', 'replaced', 'get', 'mention', 'Mordant', 'treated', 'always', 'been', 'day', 'one', 'fourth', 'hate', 'kid', 'know', 'was', 'kids', 'movie', 'wanted', 'someone', 'kids', 'identify', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'real', 'fan', 'kid', 'actors', 'film', 'original', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'Temple', 'Doom', 'Blues', 'Brothers', '2000', '[', 'took', 'many', 'viewings', 'even', 'tolerate', 'Buster', ']', 'how', 'heck', 'kid', 'age', 'know', 'how', 'operate', 'monorail', 'crane', 'few', 'minor', 'problems', 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'will', 'keep', 'kids', 'occupied', 'hour', 'half']",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie VHS

384681,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,6303675220,dylan21484nj,"[1, 2]","Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is a strange creature. I guess you could call it an ""alternate universe"" Power Rangers story. Yes, the movie does share similar story points to the end of Season 2 and beginning of Season 3 of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers television series, where a new villain arrives, destroys the Rangers' powers, and the powerless Rangers must embark on a journey to find a new power source in order to defeat the new threat.However, this movie is completely independent of the canon of the television series that spawned it because the events of the movie, particularly its main antagonist Ivan Ooze, are never mentioned or referenced in the TV series. I guess the filmmakers' intent was to make a movie that didn't require the audience to know about the television series.The acting isn't much different from the television series, since most of the main actors from the show reprise their roles here. The new villain, Ivan Ooze, comes off more like Grampa Munster, devious but in an almost innocuous way. And oddly enough, for a guy who has been trapped in a giant egg for 6,000 years, he can still make Brady Bunch references. I guess he managed to get a cable signal in that egg somehow.The movie does have a shinier, glossier look and feel to it expected of a movie with a bigger budget. The monsters and villains from the television show have received a noticeable makeover, and the Power Rangers' costumes themselves have also received a redesign, replacing the spandex with sleek suits of armor. Even the soundtrack gets an upgrade by composer Graeme Revell and utilizes source music from Van Halen and Red Hot Chili Peppers.The Power Rangers' Zords and their monster foes in the television show were simply men in costumes stomping through miniature city sets made of cardboard a la Godzilla; this footage was taken directly from the Super Sentai series from Japan that gave birth to the Power Rangers franchise in America. But in this movie, the Zords and Ivan Ooze's giant insect robots are obviously products of computer-generated effects, though the CG work here is circa 1995 and nowhere near as good as the most recent ""giant fighting robots"" movies like Transformers.In all, this is a basic ""good vs. evil"" kid's movie with lots of shiny things for your kids to enjoy, but don't expect something deeper.",3,"Ahhh, the Power Rangers have seen better days",1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,2351,"['Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'strange', 'creature', 'guess', 'could', 'call', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'story', 'Yes', 'movie', 'share', 'similar', 'story', 'points', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'beginning', 'Season', '3', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'television', 'series', 'where', 'new', 'villain', 'arrives', 'Rangers', 'powers', 'powerless', 'Rangers', 'must', 'embark', 'journey', 'find', 'new', 'power', 'source', 'order', 'defeat', 'new', 'threat.However', 'movie', 'completely', 'independent', 'canon', 'television', 'series', 'spawned', 'events', 'movie', 'particularly', 'main', 'antagonist', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'are', 'never', 'mentioned', 'referenced', 'TV', 'series', 'guess', 'filmmakers', 'intent', 'was', 'make', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'audience', 'know', 'television', 'series.The', 'acting', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'television', 'series', 'most', 'main', 'actors', 'show', 'reprise', 'roles', 'here', 'new', 'villain', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'off', 'more', 'Grampa', 'Munster', 'devious', 'almost', 'innocuous', 'way', 'oddly', 'enough', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'trapped', 'giant', 'egg', '6,000', 'years', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'references', 'guess', 'managed', 'get', 'cable', 'signal', 'egg', 'somehow.The', 'movie', 'have', 'shinier', 'glossier', 'look', 'feel', 'expected', 'movie', 'bigger', 'budget', 'monsters', 'villains', 'television', 'show', 'have', 'received', 'noticeable', 'makeover', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'costumes', 'have', 'also', 'received', 'redesign', 'replacing', 'spandex', 'sleek', 'suits', 'armor', 'Even', 'soundtrack', 'upgrade', 'composer', 'Graeme', 'Revell', 'utilizes', 'source', 'music', 'Van', 'Halen', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Peppers.The', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Zords', 'monster', 'foes', 'television', 'show', 'were', 'simply', 'men', 'costumes', 'stomping', 'miniature', 'city', 'sets', 'made', 'cardboard', 'la', 'Godzilla', 'footage', 'was', 'taken', 'directly', 'Super', 'Sentai', 'series', 'Japan', 'gave', 'birth', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'franchise', 'America', 'movie', 'Zords', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'giant', 'insect', 'robots', 'are', 'obviously', 'products', 'computer-generated', 'effects', 'CG', 'work', 'here', 'circa', '1995', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'recent', 'giant', 'fighting', 'robots', 'movies', 'Transformers.In', 'basic', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'kid', 'movie', 'lots', 'shiny', 'things', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'something', 'deeper']",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie VHS

I am a big Power Rangers fan and have been since day one, even though I was 26 when the show debuted on Fox back in 1994. I grew up loving Ultraman and Johnny Sokko & Giant Robot as a tyke, so the colorful heroes and giant monster action of MMPR hooked me right away. The editing out all non-costumed Japanese actor footage and replacing/re-shooting with homogenized American multi-ethnic actors (Sabanization, as it is often referred to) was jarring and odd at first, but eventually grew on me. I had a crush on Kimberly & Trini and admired young outsider Tommy and I enjoyed watching him grow over the course of the shows to eventually the eventual leader of the Rangers. I love the later closed loop series just as much, if not more. So, with that said...The original series was more fun than this movie outing, IMHO. Actually just feels like a padded episode or two. Action is okay and probably this film's biggest strong point, but some puzzling choices make the movie an odd stand alone mess. Zordon is now a wrinkly, doughy guy in a blobby robe, sort of like Bulk with a glandular condition. Alpha 5 also sports a new look for no good reason, as do the Rangers themselves. The concept designs may have looked cool on paper but the execution of the uniforms comes across looking pretty cheesy; too shiny & flimsy, like paper-thin vinyl. The command center is suddenly a huge, well-equipped, hanger-like, brightly lit place!? All interesting choices, but they foolishly were NOT incorporated into the series, so it just feels all wrong somehow, like a Bizzaro universe Rangers adventure. It was also painfully obvious that this was shot in Australia. Suddenly, most of the Angel Grove's citizens sound like Crocodile Dundee. I understand that this film was shot in the Land Down Under for budgetary reasons, but they could've at least faked American accents or used some California surfer slang; they didn't even try to hide their accents. A poor choice that confuses things even further.One-shot villain Ivan Ooze is funny and kind of cool, thanks to a surprisingly enthusiastic performance from the unrecognizable Paul Freeman, (perhaps best-known as evil French archaeologist Beloque from Raiders of The Lost Ark). Sadly, the CGI effects were far too new at the time this was attempted to pull off convincingly, especially on this film's relatively low budget and tight production time frame. Which brings me to the Zords & monsters. UGH! Just terrible eyesores now. It just MIGHT have dazzled 5 year olds back in the day, but boy does it look gawd-awful now. Traditional 'man-in-suit' F/X used in the shows are classic and have an old school charm all their own. The decision to utilize CGI to be trendy & hip like Jurassic Park was not very well thought out. The computerized creatures look embarrassingly bad, like the cheapest pre-viz footage you'd see used for current VFX-heavy films today. So to sum up: this movie outing for the afternoon TV heroes is a barely marginal time waster, IF you have nothing else to watch. If you happen to have some of the MMPR (or later series) episodes on DVD, watch them instead. They're a lot more fun.",3,MMPR movie is just OK; has aged quite poorly.

384695,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6303675220,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[3, 4]","With the exception ofThe Lion King, the original Power Rangers movie is the first film that I badgered my parents to let me see in theaters, months before it was released. I never had money for the toys or video games, but man oh man did I live for the series and the occasional present to the fans like this cinematic release was. The Power Rangers planted the love of martial arts in me that still lives today...but after approximately fourteen years of neglecting their existence, even their magnum opus - this film - isn't quite as fun for me as it used to be. My appreciation for certain aspects of it has grown, but as a movie meant to entertain me, it's no longer satisfying.The story: when the evil intergalactic despot Ivan Ooze (Paul Freeman,Raiders of the Lost Ark) attempts to take over Angel Grove by stripping the Power Rangers of their abilities and destroying the Command Center, the team's only hope lies in traveling to a distant planet to unlock a mysterious new power to replace the one they lost.The most obvious praise this movie deserves is for its production values. TV director Bryan Spicer (24,Parker Lewis Can't Lose) squeezes the absolute most out of his relatively meager $15 million budget, including an impressive physical scope featuring several large and exotic sets, as well as an extensive CGI sequence that looked pretty good in its day; shoot, he even found a way to finance a complete skydiving sequence! Though the computer graphics would be matched and eventually surpassed by later installments of the TV series, I'd argue that this is the unequivocal best that the Rangers have ever looked, aesthetically. The quality falters sometimes - Goldar's new costume and those of the Tengu are pretty mediocre by blockbuster standards - but if it's style you're after, then you won't find the franchise looking any better than it did here.There's little to speak of in the way of acting content. There's only one legitimate dramatic exchange between human characters (i.e. Jason ""Tommy"" Frank solemnly addressing Amy ""Kimberly"" Johnson, prior to the Tengu attack), and it's pretty weak. The only character who has any sort of platform is Ivan Ooze, and while Paul Freeman is a pretty good actor, no charm permeates the villain, who's written a little too jokey for me to take him seriously, even in the Power Rangers universe. Of course, even the youngest of viewers will know that it's really the action scenes we're after, not award-winning drama. While I'm pretty pass&eacute; on the computer-generated Zord battle at the end, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of at least two of the three martial arts battles. Fight choreographer Jeff Pruitt was a regular on the series, but his background in more conventional martial arts features (e.g.Mission of Justice,Martial Law II: Undercover) shines through: while I can't speak for the scenes wherein the Rangers are in full costume, their unmasked fight features very little use of stunt doubles and an emphasis on smooth karate forms without excessive cutting. The fights get a bit more fantastical once the Rangers don their gear, featuring more than a bit of wirework, but there's still enough cool moves and obvious athleticism apparent for me to applaud them.As aforementioned, it's been a while since I watched the Power Rangers, and I have to admit I was surprised (and slightly nauseated) by how goody two-shoes these guys are - for the love of god, the movie opens with them performing charity skydiving to save an observatory! - but I accept that this is just part of their personas (still, no wonder they couldn't find any use for authentic human dialogue). In ways like this, the movie successfully encompasses everything that's both good and bad about the franchise, signaling good news for fans and bad news for parents. I'm not looking at a bad movie here, simply one I've outgrown.",3,"""A teenager with a big mouth...

384704,A2UAOP0VUA12EQ,6303675220,"Sam Allen ""A zealous individual""","[13, 14]","I was a huge fan of the Power Rangers when this movie was released into theaters, so you can bet I went out and saw it. However, as much as I enjoyed it, I eventually felt that I had outgrown the Power Rangers. For a while, I just thought they were plainly stupid. However, my enjoyment for the laughably bad acting and writing in the television show made me realize how good the ORIGINAL series truly was. Only the original series was what I watched. This movie is actually somewhat well-written compared to the series, and takes place in somewhat of an alternate universe. Many differences between the movie and television series are noticeable.-Zordon, Alpha-5, and the command center look very different. The Command Center is much larger and more detailed.-Unlike in the television series, the rangers have a large power coin of their power on the chest of their tights.-Tommy's power is ""White Tiger"" instead of ""Tigerzord.""-The helmets are bigger and bulkier. The tights look like they are made of leather rather than cloth.-Mordant, the pig warrior who appeared with Goldar as Lord Zedd's henchmen, was never featured in the TV series.-The story of how the Rangers lost their powers and received their Ninja powers is told differently from the way it is told in the television series. Also, in the series, the Ninja Rangers have masks that cover their entire face, unlike here.-A couple of gadgets that were never used in the series are used here: Rocky's helmet has a scope built into it and Aisha's helmet has headlights built into the eyes.-Weapons previously unused on the tv series are here, and Power Weapons/Blade Blasters are ignored. Billy has a new sword, the Stega Stinger, and Kimberly has a Thunder Whip.-Goldar, Rita, and Zedd have a few notable alterations in appearance.-Putties are nowhere to be seen, instead they take on Ooze Children and Tenga Warriors as standard enemies.The movie is also different from your typical Power Rangers TV episode. It's true that Zedd and Rita are in the movie, but they ally with the film's main villain, Ivan Ooze, after freeing him from imprisonment in an egg, and he has got to be the nasiest villain they ever fought. He even turns against the usual evil of Zedd and Rita and imprisons them inside of a snowglobe! The Rangers go through a lot more than just, fight wussie monsters, trouble fighting real monster, monster grows, Thunder Megazord owns. For starters, there is no Thunder Megazord. Instead, there is the Ninja Megazord (Pink Crane, Black Frog, Yellow Bear, Blue Wolf, and Red Ape) and the Ninja Megafalconzord, which adds on the White Falcon. The acting is still sub-par, but what do you expect? I like the movie because it gives fans a taste of a slightly different universe than what was used before. If you are young and getting into the GOD-AWFUL new breeds of Power Rangers (Mystic Force?) then give this a try and see what you've been missing. If you liked any of the shows as a child, give this a try as well. If you think the Power Rangers are just plain stupid, then DON'T.Also, I have noticed that most all major critics gave this movie poor reviews. However, there is a reason for that. They are actually taking the movie SERIOUSLY. Whatever you do, don't take this film seriously, if you are an adult it is pretty much meant to be taken as a joke. Only a kid between the ages of 4 and 7 would take it seriously and enjoy it.",5,"For what it is, this movie is excellent",1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,3412,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'can', 'bet', 'went', 'out', 'saw', 'However', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'eventually', 'felt', 'had', 'outgrown', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'while', 'just', 'thought', 'were', 'plainly', 'stupid', 'However', 'enjoyment', 'laughably', 'bad', 'acting', 'writing', 'television', 'show', 'made', 'realize', 'how', 'good', 'ORIGINAL', 'series', 'truly', 'was', 'Only', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'what', 'watched', 'movie', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'well-written', 'compared', 'series', 'place', 'somewhat', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Many', 'differences', 'movie', 'television', 'series', 'are', 'noticeable.-Zordon', 'Alpha-5', 'command', 'center', 'look', 'very', 'different', 'Command', 'Center', 'much', 'larger', 'more', 'detailed.-Unlike', 'television', 'series', 'rangers', 'have', 'large', 'power', 'coin', 'power', 'chest', 'tights.-Tommy', 'power', 'White', 'Tiger', 'instead', 'Tigerzord', '-The', 'helmets', 'are', 'bigger', 'bulkier', 'tights', 'look', 'are', 'made', 'leather', 'rather', 'cloth.-Mordant', 'pig', 'warrior', 'who', 'appeared', 'Goldar', 'Lord', 'Zedd', 'henchmen', 'was', 'never', 'featured', 'TV', 'series.-The', 'story', 'how', 'Rangers', 'lost', 'powers', 'received', 'Ninja', 'powers', 'told', 'differently', 'way', 'told', 'television', 'series', 'Also', 'series', 'Ninja', 'Rangers', 'have', 'masks', 'cover', 'entire', 'face', 'here.-A', 'couple', 'gadgets', 'were', 'never', 'used', 'series', 'are', 'used', 'here', 'Rocky', 'helmet', 'scope', 'built', 'Aisha', 'helmet', 'headlights', 'built', 'eyes.-Weapons', 'previously', 'unused', 'tv', 'series', 'are', 'here', 'Power', 'Weapons/Blade', 'Blasters', 'are', 'ignored', 'Billy', 'new', 'sword', 'Stega', 'Stinger', 'Kimberly', 'Thunder', 'Whip.-Goldar', 'Rita', 'Zedd', 'have', 'few', 'notable', 'alterations', 'appearance.-Putties', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'instead', 'take', 'Ooze', 'Children', 'Tenga', 'Warriors', 'standard', 'enemies.The', 'movie', 'also', 'different', 'typical', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'TV', 'episode', 'true', 'Zedd', 'Rita', 'are', 'movie', 'ally', 'film', 'main', 'villain', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'freeing', 'imprisonment', 'egg', 'got', 'be', 'nasiest', 'villain', 'ever', 'fought', 'even', 'usual', 'evil', 'Zedd', 'Rita', 'imprisons', 'snowglobe', 'Rangers', 'go', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'fight', 'wussie', 'monsters', 'trouble', 'fighting', 'real', 'monster', 'monster', 'grows', 'Thunder', 'Megazord', 'starters', 'Thunder', 'Megazord', 'Instead', 'Ninja', 'Megazord', 'Pink', 'Crane', 'Black', 'Frog', 'Yellow', 'Bear', 'Blue', 'Wolf', 'Red', 'Ape', 'Ninja', 'Megafalconzord', 'White', 'Falcon', 'acting', 'still', 'sub-par', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'movie', 'fans', 'taste', 'slightly', 'different', 'universe', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'before', 'are', 'young', 'getting', 'GOD-AWFUL', 'new', 'breeds', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Mystic', 'Force', 'then', 'give', 'try', 'see', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'missing', 'liked', 'shows', 'child', 'give', 'try', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'then', ""DON'T.Also"", 'have', 'noticed', 'most', 'major', 'critics', 'gave', 'movie', 'poor', 'reviews', 'However', 'reason', 'are', 'actually', 'taking', 'movie', 'SERIOUSLY', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'are', 'adult', 'pretty', 'much', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'joke', 'Only', 'kid', 'ages', '4', '7', 'would', 'take', 'seriously', 'enjoy']",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie VHS
