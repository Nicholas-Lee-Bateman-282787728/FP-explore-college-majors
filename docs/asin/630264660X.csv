325715,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,630264660X,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 1]","The sequal to ""King of The Kickboxers"" goes in a completely different direction, and could easily just have been called ""American Shaolin"" and left at that.  The same production company is involved, thus creating another cheesy movie, but with above average fighting compared to the typical American-made martial arts film.  Although the whole idea of an American (Drew Carson played by Reese Madigan) coming to study at the Shaolin Temple is a bit unbelievable, it ends up being a fun and unique story that seemed to grab my attention eventually.The beginning is a little slow, acting is poor, and everything is just downright cheesy.  Drew is humilated at a local tournament, by a guy who fights dirty - including pulling down the pants of his opponent (don't worry, its not perverted or anything).  Drew feels the only to way to become good enough is to train with the best, and travels to China hoping to become a Shaolin Monk.  After painstankingly waiting for days, he is accepted.  While in the Temple, Drew constantly causes trouble, which leads others to do the same.  It actually becomes interesting to see if he can actually make it as a Monk.  There are still plenty of cheesy scenes, but alot of it becomes fun, and you gotta love the soundtrack, which is a slightly different version of ""Summertime Blues"".The action is sparse in the first half of the film, but began to pick up more and more.  The real treat is the finale of the film.  Drew once again faces off in the ring against his former opponent.  There is a pretty good fight between the Daniel Dae Kim character and this guy, who eventually tosses Kim out of the ring.  Drew has no choice but to fight, and does so in a well choreogprahed fight which lasts at least 5 minutes.In the end, I couldn't decide how I felt about the film.  I enjoyed the fighting the most, but couldn't decide if the story was just silly or what.  It is fun for what it is, but I got that darn Shaolin Temple blues song stuck in my head.",3,"""ain't no cure for the shaolin temple blues""",1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,1988,"['sequal', 'King', 'Kickboxers', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'could', 'easily', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'American', 'Shaolin', 'left', 'same', 'production', 'company', 'involved', 'thus', 'creating', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'above', 'average', 'fighting', 'compared', 'typical', 'American-made', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'whole', 'idea', 'American', 'Drew', 'Carson', 'played', 'Reese', 'Madigan', 'coming', 'study', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'up', 'being', 'fun', 'unique', 'story', 'seemed', 'grab', 'attention', 'eventually.The', 'beginning', 'little', 'slow', 'acting', 'poor', 'everything', 'just', 'downright', 'cheesy', 'Drew', 'humilated', 'local', 'tournament', 'guy', 'who', 'dirty', 'including', 'pulling', 'down', 'pants', 'opponent', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'not', 'perverted', 'anything', 'Drew', 'only', 'way', 'become', 'good', 'enough', 'train', 'best', 'travels', 'China', 'hoping', 'become', 'Shaolin', 'Monk', 'painstankingly', 'waiting', 'days', 'accepted', 'Temple', 'Drew', 'constantly', 'trouble', 'others', 'do', 'same', 'actually', 'interesting', 'see', 'can', 'actually', 'make', 'Monk', 'are', 'still', 'plenty', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'alot', 'fun', 'got', 'ta', 'soundtrack', 'slightly', 'different', 'version', 'Summertime', 'Blues', '.The', 'action', 'sparse', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'began', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'more', 'real', 'treat', 'finale', 'film', 'Drew', 'once', 'again', 'off', 'ring', 'former', 'opponent', 'pretty', 'good', 'fight', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'character', 'guy', 'who', 'eventually', 'Kim', 'ring', 'Drew', 'choice', 'fight', 'so', 'well', 'choreogprahed', 'fight', 'least', '5', 'minutes.In', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'how', 'felt', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'fighting', 'most', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'what', 'fun', 'what', 'got', 'darn', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'blues', 'song', 'stuck', 'head']",American Shaolin:King of Kickboxers 2 VHS

325718,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,630264660X,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","""American Shaolin"" is the fifth of seven martial arts movies created by the Season Film Corporation that combine Hong Kong action and production values with American performers. It's easily the most ambitious of the series but also arguably the least satisfying when viewed purely as a karate movie. The increased emphasis on plot and character development may be enough for others to rate it more generously, but I can't see fit to rate it any higher than three stars.The story: martial artist Drew Carson (Reese Madigan) is defeated and humiliated in a tournament match by a dirty fighter (Trent Bushey, ""All My Children""). Vowing to never let this happen again, he travels to the Shaolin Temple in China to train with the legendary fighting monks...I have to praise the film's aesthetic accomplishments. This is clearly a relatively low budget movie, but many of the scenes set in the temple highlight the lavish locations and a lot of the ceremonial costumes are eye-catching. The cinematography isn't without merit: scenes wherein dozens of monks strike forms in a courtyard would have fit perfectly into an older wuxia film. The dramatic content sets a high for the series, though I have to remind you that the acting in previous entries likeNo Retreat, No Surrenderwas pretty darn bad and not too difficult to build on. Reese Madigan is probably the soundest leading man the series ever had, and a young Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) as a supporting disciple shows some of the talent he'd subsequently find acclaim for. Head abbot Henry O (Romeo Must Die) gives what's easily the best straight performance these films have ever seen.The focus of the movie is on Drew, who - as a member of a class of disciples - goes through the rigorous training of the Shaolin tradition. Filmmakers long ago have learned that this is easy fodder for a bunch of cool training scenes, but ""American Shaolin"" is far from beingThe 36th Chamber of Shaolinin this regard. The training scenes aren't all that creative or entertaining, at least not as much as the out-of-nowhere practices in surrealism like an impromptu music video for a cover version of ""Summertime Blues."" Also, Drew isn't exactly the most sympathetic character for most of the movie: personifying the dumb American foreigner, he's always doing stupid things like playing pranks on his sifu (Cliff Lenderman,Superfights), complaining about the food, and sneaking his monk brothers out of the temple to fight at a dance party.Things like character deficiencies would be easier to overlook if the action content was more engaging, but I think it's safe to say that this is a low point for the series. Then again, it's not a total loss: the fights get better as the movie progresses, finishing with a set of very good ring matches. However, most of the brawls are definitely below the standard. This is the first time where I got the impression that the performers just couldn't keep up with the pace required by the choreography: many of the battle are grounded exchanges of kung fu movements like you'd see in Shaw Bros. flicks, but most of the performers are slow enough to make the fights look fake. I think everyone involved here would have fared better with more conventional kickboxing-style fights.The movie's upbeat tone eventually saves it from being too boring; I can't imagine what this film would have been like had it been directed in a more depressed manner. If you're going to collect the entire series, then definitely pick this one up (for a decent price), but unless the subject matter particularly piques your interest, save it for a rental.",3,"""I just wanna be a monk!""",1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,3604,"['American', 'Shaolin', 'fifth', 'seven', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'created', 'Season', 'Film', 'Corporation', 'combine', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'production', 'values', 'American', 'performers', 'easily', 'most', 'ambitious', 'series', 'also', 'arguably', 'least', 'satisfying', 'when', 'viewed', 'purely', 'karate', 'movie', 'increased', 'emphasis', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'others', 'rate', 'more', 'generously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'fit', 'rate', 'higher', 'three', 'stars.The', 'story', 'martial', 'artist', 'Drew', 'Carson', 'Reese', 'Madigan', 'defeated', 'humiliated', 'tournament', 'match', 'dirty', 'fighter', 'Trent', 'Bushey', 'My', 'Children', 'Vowing', 'never', 'let', 'happen', 'again', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'China', 'train', 'legendary', 'fighting', 'monks', 'have', 'praise', 'film', 'aesthetic', 'accomplishments', 'clearly', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'many', 'scenes', 'set', 'temple', 'highlight', 'lavish', 'locations', 'lot', 'ceremonial', 'costumes', 'are', 'eye-catching', 'cinematography', ""n't"", 'merit', 'scenes', 'wherein', 'dozens', 'monks', 'strike', 'forms', 'courtyard', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'older', 'wuxia', 'film', 'dramatic', 'content', 'high', 'series', 'have', 'remind', 'acting', 'previous', 'entries', 'likeNo', 'Retreat', 'No', 'Surrenderwas', 'pretty', 'bad', 'not', 'too', 'difficult', 'build', 'Reese', 'Madigan', 'probably', 'soundest', 'leading', 'man', 'series', 'ever', 'had', 'young', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'Lost', 'supporting', 'disciple', 'talent', ""'d"", 'subsequently', 'find', 'acclaim', 'Head', 'Henry', 'O', 'Romeo', 'Must', 'Die', 'what', 'easily', 'best', 'straight', 'performance', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'focus', 'movie', 'Drew', 'who', 'member', 'class', 'disciples', 'rigorous', 'training', 'Shaolin', 'tradition', 'Filmmakers', 'long', 'ago', 'have', 'learned', 'easy', 'fodder', 'bunch', 'cool', 'training', 'scenes', 'American', 'Shaolin', 'far', 'beingThe', '36th', 'Chamber', 'Shaolinin', 'regard', 'training', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'creative', 'entertaining', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'out-of-nowhere', 'practices', 'surrealism', 'impromptu', 'music', 'video', 'cover', 'version', 'Summertime', 'Blues', 'Also', 'Drew', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'most', 'movie', 'personifying', 'dumb', 'American', 'foreigner', 'always', 'doing', 'stupid', 'things', 'playing', 'pranks', 'sifu', 'Cliff', 'Lenderman', 'Superfights', 'complaining', 'food', 'sneaking', 'monk', 'brothers', 'temple', 'fight', 'dance', 'party.Things', 'character', 'deficiencies', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'overlook', 'action', 'content', 'was', 'more', 'engaging', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'low', 'point', 'series', 'Then', 'again', 'not', 'total', 'loss', 'fights', 'get', 'better', 'movie', 'finishing', 'set', 'very', 'good', 'ring', 'matches', 'However', 'most', 'brawls', 'are', 'definitely', 'standard', 'first', 'time', 'where', 'got', 'impression', 'performers', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'pace', 'required', 'choreography', 'many', 'battle', 'are', 'grounded', 'exchanges', 'kung', 'fu', 'movements', ""'d"", 'see', 'Shaw', 'Bros.', 'flicks', 'most', 'performers', 'are', 'slow', 'enough', 'make', 'fights', 'look', 'fake', 'think', 'everyone', 'involved', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'better', 'more', 'conventional', 'kickboxing-style', 'fights.The', 'movie', 'upbeat', 'tone', 'eventually', 'being', 'too', 'boring', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'more', 'depressed', 'manner', ""'re"", 'going', 'collect', 'entire', 'series', 'then', 'definitely', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'decent', 'price', 'subject', 'matter', 'particularly', 'piques', 'interest', 'save', 'rental']",American Shaolin:King of Kickboxers 2 VHS
325719,APIW11UEPKIC2,630264660X,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[0, 1]","A young man named Drew loses a martial arts tournament and decides that he should go to China and become a Shaoln monk.  When he arrives he is for some reason surprised that they won't let him in.  He sits outside day and night, and they finally let him join the new Shaolin monk training group.  He is constantly making trouble and playing tricks on his Sifu, but finally realizes that he must focus if he wants to become a fighting monk.  After passing his training he goes to take revenge on the fighter who beat him at the start of the movie.If you have seen theNo Retreat No Surrendermovies, then you are probably going to like this.  It is very corny, but not quite as corny as a lot of the other movies from the Seasonal Film Company.  One good cheesy part is where Drew teaches his fellow students the song Summertime Blues, except they change the words to Shaolin Temple Blues.  Although the actor who plays Drew is not a great actor, the movie has a somewhat unique story and overall it is pretty fun.The action is done by Corey Yuen Kwai and Yuen Tak.  I like how they keep the fights on the ground and don't worry about using wires.  The lead actor is a good screen fighter and the other actors are good.  The young monks Sifu has a good short fight scene.  This guy is amazing and I wish he had more than 1 fight.  Once Drew passes his training wires do get involved, but it is done very well, and they only use wires about 4 times.  The last 10 minutes of the movie has 2 kickboxing matches and the final fight is a ton of fun. The great thing about the fights is that there are a lot of exchanges without cutting.  The choreography in the final fight is up their with any of the American type movies that Seasonal Films has made.And be sure to look for a young fighting Daniel Dae Kim as Drew's rival at the temple.  Maybe it is just because I am a big fan of the TV show 'Lost', but I thought it was cool to see him in action.3/5The DVD from Platinum Disc is full screen but it doesn't affect the action.  I had to turn the volume up pretty high but the sound is good. Picture quality has a bit of speckling but overall it is good.",3,"""I wanna become a Shaolin monk!""",1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,2147,"['young', 'man', 'named', 'Drew', 'martial', 'arts', 'tournament', 'should', 'go', 'China', 'become', 'Shaoln', 'monk', 'When', 'reason', 'surprised', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'outside', 'day', 'night', 'finally', 'let', 'join', 'new', 'Shaolin', 'monk', 'training', 'group', 'constantly', 'making', 'trouble', 'playing', 'tricks', 'Sifu', 'finally', 'must', 'focus', 'become', 'fighting', 'monk', 'passing', 'training', 'take', 'revenge', 'fighter', 'who', 'beat', 'start', 'movie.If', 'have', 'seen', 'theNo', 'Retreat', 'No', 'Surrendermovies', 'then', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'like', 'very', 'corny', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'corny', 'lot', 'other', 'movies', 'Seasonal', 'Film', 'Company', 'One', 'good', 'cheesy', 'part', 'where', 'Drew', 'fellow', 'students', 'song', 'Summertime', 'Blues', 'change', 'words', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'Blues', 'actor', 'who', 'Drew', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'story', 'overall', 'pretty', 'fun.The', 'action', 'done', 'Corey', 'Yuen', 'Kwai', 'Yuen', 'Tak', 'like', 'how', 'keep', 'fights', 'ground', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'using', 'wires', 'lead', 'actor', 'good', 'screen', 'fighter', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'young', 'monks', 'Sifu', 'good', 'short', 'fight', 'scene', 'guy', 'amazing', 'wish', 'had', 'more', '1', 'fight', 'Once', 'Drew', 'training', 'wires', 'do', 'get', 'involved', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'use', 'wires', '4', 'times', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', '2', 'kickboxing', 'matches', 'final', 'fight', 'ton', 'fun', 'great', 'thing', 'fights', 'are', 'lot', 'exchanges', 'cutting', 'choreography', 'final', 'fight', 'up', 'American', 'type', 'movies', 'Seasonal', 'Films', 'made.And', 'be', 'sure', 'look', 'young', 'fighting', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'Drew', 'rival', 'temple', 'Maybe', 'just', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'TV', 'show', ""'Lost"", 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'action.3/5The', 'DVD', 'Platinum', 'Disc', 'full', 'screen', ""n't"", 'affect', 'action', 'had', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', 'pretty', 'high', 'sound', 'good', 'Picture', 'quality', 'bit', 'speckling', 'overall', 'good']",American Shaolin:King of Kickboxers 2 VHS
