They generally have uplifting messages, show the value of hard work, and always show the most exciting parts of the game. ""Glory Road"" was no exception.This movie is about Texas Western University (The Mighty Miners) and how they made history. The team consisted almost equally of blacks and whites - but the black players had the majority. Don Haskins lead the first all black starting line up in 1966. Racism effected him, his family, and his players.I highly recommend this movie. The actors were all phenomenal; the directing and editing was great; and the scenes seemed to bring you right into the movie (I was cheering and booing during the games). This is one of the few movies I would even say it is a good move to buy before you ever see it - I doubt you will regret purchasing it.The extras on the DVD are even great. I generally don't watch the interviews of the real people but I loved those segments. The 22 minute interview of the real players and the 12 minute interviews about Don Haskins and the numerous boys he coached were my favorite.",5,Shockingly Impressive,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,1165,"['am', 'rarely', 'seen', 'watching', 'sports', 'television', 'reason', 'have', 'become', 'huge', 'fan', 'sport', 'movies', 'generally', 'have', 'uplifting', 'messages', 'show', 'value', 'hard', 'work', 'always', 'show', 'most', 'exciting', 'parts', 'game', 'Glory', 'Road', 'was', 'exception.This', 'movie', 'Texas', 'Western', 'University', 'Mighty', 'Miners', 'how', 'made', 'history', 'team', 'consisted', 'almost', 'equally', 'blacks', 'whites', 'black', 'players', 'had', 'majority', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'lead', 'first', 'black', 'starting', 'line', 'up', '1966', 'Racism', 'effected', 'family', 'players.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'actors', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'directing', 'editing', 'was', 'great', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'bring', 'right', 'movie', 'was', 'cheering', 'booing', 'games', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'good', 'move', 'buy', 'ever', 'see', 'doubt', 'will', 'regret', 'purchasing', 'it.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'even', 'great', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'interviews', 'real', 'people', 'loved', 'segments', '22', 'minute', 'interview', 'real', 'players', '12', 'minute', 'interviews', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'numerous', 'boys', 'coached', 'were', 'favorite']",N/A
980439,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000EXZFCQ,A Customer,"[1, 1]","Set in 1965, Glory Road could easily be mistaken for just another triumphal basketball movie. Thankfully the film is so much more and most viewers be pleasantly surprised by this bio of the 1966 Texas Western Miners, the first college basketball team to win an NCAA championship with a starting lineup of mainly ""Negro"" players.Josh Lucas - in possibly the best role of his career - plays Don Haskins, young and good-looking coach who spends much of his time coaching women's basketball teams. Suddenly given his shot at coaching Division I basketball in football-mad Texas, where part of the job meant living in the dorms with his wife (Emily Deschanel) and three kids.Haskins is determined to build a winning team, but with pathetic recruitment resources, the coach is forced to use his imagination. So he tours Northeast ghetto playgrounds and ends up busing half a dozen African-Americans to the banks of the Rio Grande. This proves to be a culture shock on both sides.The local whites and Latinos don't know what to make of the new scholarship students - some of them have probably never seen a black person before - while the Northern urbanites get their first tastes of deserts and tacos. Of course, there's some inevitable racial tension, but Haskins soon gets his white and black players working together.There's no doubt Haskins is a tough taskmaster, and he hates to see the boys wasting time with wine, women and song. He also refreshingly acknowledges that he's not that talented and doesn't have all the answers. As the team rises in the national rankings, they are forced to endure racism and suffer various indignities especially in the South - from being pelted with food as they enter arenas to having racial epithets scrawled on their hotel-room walls.When the attacks on them grow more vehement and even violent in their animosity, their morale is affected and in one near-brilliant sequence, the black players refuse to work with their white teammates, resulting in a rare, humiliating loss.  When the Miners reach the final against ""Baron"" Adolph Rupp's (Jon Voight) Kentucky Wildcats, Haskins decides to make a statement by only playing the African-Americans.The film has a great look and feel of the sixties, with Lucas perfectly cast as Haskins and Mehcad Brooks leads a solid cadre of youthful players who manage to both look convincing on the court and convey the mix of anger and enthusiasm that the youths felt. Although Glory Road is essentially a Disney Film, it doesn't shy away from showing the ugliness of racism and it's as much a civil-rights drama as a sports story.There's a real the commitment to believability here and it's felt mostly between the interaction between the black and white teammates, whose path to total solidarity is more complex than merely learning to appreciate each other's cute little music. Although Glory Road is ultimately a C+ film, it is buoyed along by its earnestness and for the most part is pretty well executed.

980442,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B000EXZFCQ,a voice of reason,"[3, 5]","I'm amazed by everything that people expect out of movies, including this one: one reviewer wants it to be a college ""Hoosiers,"" another wants more character development, another thinks it deviates from the true story too much, and on and on it goes in spite of the fact that this movie is great entertainment.First of all, if someone wants to watch ""Hoosiers,"" then by all means watch it. It's probably the greatest sports movie of all time, and it's a must-see in our home at least once a year (especially since my wife grew up on a farm in Indiana). Yes, ""Hoosiers"" has a great story. It's about far more than an underdog team that wins a championship; it's about small-town life, redemption, and Indiana's state obsession with basketball. ""Glory Road"" isn't trying to be an NCAA-level ""Hoosiers.""Secondly, characters are developed. The primary character is Coach Don Haskins, and we see his progression from a high school girl's basketball coach to coach of small-time college team that only wants him as a babysitter for the athletic dorm to a coach determined to make that small-time program a winner in spite of itself, and who gets whomever he can to play for him, to a coach who finally realizes the implications of what he has done by recruiting and playing so many black players. Haskins was no civil-rights crusader, as the accompanying documentaries on the DVD make clear (Haskins himself says that he was simply starting his best players), but he did come to realize the impact that his decision to start so many black players was having not only on basketball but on a lot of people's opinions of blacks (maybe only in the athletic arena, but it was a start). It's true that we don't get to know all of the players quite so well, but we certainly see the progression of point guard Bobby Joe Hill and the toughening of Neville Shed as well as the development of some of the others. Had all of the characters been developed in greater detail, I'm sure many people would be criticizing the movie for being too character-driven and not having enough basketball action. It's impossible to please everyone.Lastly, as to the movie not being entirely faithful to the real story, let's remember once more that movies are entertainment. ""Based on a true story"" means just that, and it's the case with all fact-based movies. If the filmmakers had wanted to make a documentary, then they would have done so, but they wanted to make an entertaining film. They did a fantastic job of recreating 1960's American society, and they never deviated from the truth in such a way that they distorted or tainted the story. Even though the film itself is not a documentary, the great thing is that there are some bonus documentaries from which you can get the real-life facts if that is what you are more interested in; this is the case with most DVD's that are based on true stories, so the viewer gets the best of both worlds.If every movie had everything that every viewer wanted, then we'd always be sitting in the theater or in front of our TV's for 6-hour marathons. If you want just the facts, then watch A&E;, the History Channel, and PBS; they all run great documentaries. ""Glory Road"" is simply a highly entertaining film about a disparate and unlikely group of players who came together under the tutelage of an underrated coach to accomplish a wonderful feat during a time of great upheaval in our country's history. If that's not entertainment, then what is? Don't nitpick.

980445,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000EXZFCQ,Bill Garrison,"[1, 2]","Glory Road tells the true story of the improbable run of UTEP's (then known as Texas Western) NCAA basketball national championship.The movie opens with Josh Lucas playing Don Haskins.  Haskins is a girl's coach that jumps at the opportunity to coach Division 1 basketball.  With a limited recruiting budget, Haskins sets out to find the best players he can find.  With the big name stars turning him down, he starts recruiting black players.  This was risky because at the time, many college teams were still all-white.The movie introduces the players humurously then follows their trek to West Texas and their formation into a team by Haskins.  The team starts winning games and rising in the rankings and then, in what provides the only edgier part of the film, begin receiving racial threats.  Even these don't seem too serious and we all know this is a true story and how it ends.  Still, the movie moves quickly and provides plenty of thrills and humor as the team overcomes the odds to beat Kentucky in the finals.The movie alters the truth a bit:  Haskins came to UTEP in 61, not 66, the team already had three black players when he arrived, and the team did not play the uptempo, showboat style to win as portrayed in the movie.Overall this is a good movie and stands out because of the performance of Lucas as Haskins and the large cast of basketball players, both black and white.  Knowing this was a true story, the movie had to leave out the standard team has to lose before they can win plotline.  Also for being a movie based on race, the racial tension was not a large part of the movie (although it was definitely present).This is a good movie that tells a true story with fun and excitement.

980446,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000EXZFCQ,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 7]","Nothing should take away from the amazing circumstances that led coach Don Haskins to defy southern standards and start playing a mostly black NCAA team in El Paso, Texas during a time when the U.S. was rife with bigoted undertones. But then you watch this Disney film and wonder what went wrong...The legend of ""The Bear"" (Haskins) lives on in the El Paso community and should leave little doubt in anyone's mind that this great man accomplished something extraordinary in 1966 by leading his black and white Texas Western basketball team to the national title. But in the hands of screenwriter Bettina Gilois, the film falls far short of rousing entertainment.The movie stars Josh Lucas (SECOND HAND LIONS) as Coach Haskins and Lucas pulls in a good role from this languid script. Matching ""The Bear's"" attitude toward discipline and basketball basics, Lucas' performance was the cherry on this otherwise melting, gooey mess. When we first meet Haskins, he's the coach of a girls high school basketball team and is approached by the tiny NCAA school of Texas Western. Hungry to advance his coaching career, he and his family move into the dorm for the Western team, only to learn that there's little hope for success from such a small community with a crumbling stadium. But Haskins won't give up. He travels around to various states with his coaching team, hoping to find some successful players. But all of the Great White Hopes refuse to join up. So Haskins' search takes him to Harlem, Detroit and other less-than-appealing locales, digging up some of the best black talent the streets have to offer. He meets with much resistance upon returning home, too. People call him and his team the ""N"" word, as well as other unseemly titles. But these taunts soon turn to amazed cheers as Haskins leads his team to a near undefeated first season. And when Haskins team makes it to the NCAA finals, he starts a pure black team, something never heard of in basketball up to that point.There's nothing wrong with this awesome historical story, but its execution was lacking on so many levels as to make it a yawner. The audience is jerked from one set of circumstances to the next and they never get to focus on one particular character nor care about any of these wonderful kids (most viewers will probably feel fairly detached rather than anything approaching familiarity).Comparisons between HOOSIERS and GLORY ROAD can easily be seen (although one is about high school ball while the other is NCAA), and the former still rules the high cinematic ground. Gene Hackmans' coach Dale far outclasses Lucas' portrayal of Haskins, not to mention Hoosiers excellent cohesive story, something completely absent in Glory Road. And this is a sad statement.

980447,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000EXZFCQ,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[6, 8]","Glory Road is a movie based on the true story of coach Don Haskins and his miracle victory in the 1966 NCAA men's college basketball championship against the almighty Wildcats of the University of Kentucky. Many consider this one of the greatest upsets in sports history as a team of virtual unknowns climbed the ranks, made it all the way to the national championship game, and achieved a stunning upset against one of the greatest Kentucky teams ever, coached at the time by the legendary Adolph Rupp.Glory Road is a very good film about this important game and the people who helped make it a reality. Josh Lucas is the main star of this movie and he portrays Don Haskins quite well, demonstrating the tenacity, the guts, and the determination one would expect in a great basketball coach. Haskins knows he is in a difficult situation when he takes over the coaching reigns and he knows well the insurmountable odds he faces as he takes a team that has never in its history won more than fifteen games in one season and turns it into a national champion. Josh Lucas' characterization as the tough inspirational head coach is dead- on with the true life information I have read about Don Haskins and his approach to the game and to life.Besides the actual games, one of the memorable parts of this film is its dealings with racism. This was the mid 1960's and it was a time of great social unrest and rampant racial prejudice. Don Haskins shocked everyone by recruiting a large number of black players and stirring up controversy- even among the Texas Western faithful. His players would be forced to endure racism on several levels and many of these are captured in this movie. In one scene, the team is heading to a hotel after a game and a couple of the guys open the door of their room where they are shocked and scared to see blood on the walls, spelling out racial remarks and threats. In another scene, one of the players is attacked by two racist white men in a restroom. These and other scenes like them keep the movie tense and suspenseful. However, don't watch this movie expecting to see an analysis of the race issues of the day. Instead of dwelling on the issue, the movie depicts the coach talking to his guys and quickly shifting their attention back to the game of basketball.Glory Road features some great basketball action and fans of the sport will enjoy the nail- biting finishes and the fast- paced footage. However, those who are experts on the history of the sport might be a little disappointed with the historical inaccuracies in this movie. The basics of the story are true, but director James Gartner took liberty to change some of the facts in order to make the movie more exciting and more dramatic. First, coach Haskins is shown arriving in El Paso and quickly taking the team to the championship game in his first season. In reality, Haskins came to Texas Western in 1961 so he had already been coaching a few years when his team made it to the pinnacle of college basketball. Second, many of the games themselves are presented in the movie as being much closer than they really were. The fact is that Texas Western dominated many of the teams it faced in 1966. Even when it played Kentucky for the national title (which Texas Western won by seven points), Texas Western led most of the game. I suppose that Gartner felt the need to play the role of revisionist in order to make the games more exciting and the movie more entertaining. I guess I can forgive him this time since the most important event (the win over Kentucky) has an accurate outcome and since his decision to show the games closer than they actually were does add to the movies entertainment value. But basketball purists may not like Gartner's decision to alter history.Josh Lucas is one of the main reasons this movie works so well and his performance ranks as the best I have seen him do thus far. I also liked the performances of the players. Actors Schin Kerr, Al Shearer, Damaine Ratcliff, Alphonso McAuley, Mehcad Brooks, and Derek Luke portray some of the men who made this team such a success and I enjoyed their street- tough demeanors and tendency to break the coach's rules from time to time- the exact type of attitude one would expect from guys taken from the streets of the inner cities and brought to western Texas to play college hoops. Other performers, however, are only so- so, mainly because they have so little time in front of the camera. For example, the viewer is left not really knowing much about Haskins' wife Mary because actress Emily Deschanel has very few lines in the movie. And the performance of Jon Voight as Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp is also a little disappointing, mainly because Voight has such limited time on the screen.Another enjoyable part of this movie is the extras on the DVD. There is some actual conversations with the players from this 1966 squad and some words from Don Haskins himself. A few more recent players from the Don Haskins era (he coached from 1961 to 1999) also contribute some commentary on what it was like to play under Haskins. A short segment about the ordeal of practices under Coach Haskins, a few deleted scenes, and a music video by Alicia Keys round out the DVD extras.Overall, Glory Road ranks as an entertaining sports film that takes the viewer back in time to an era when racism was alive and well in college sports and all over America. The movie doesn't delve very much into the racism issue. It sticks mainly with the game of college hoops and how a coach with guts and determination helped to forge a championship team. This movie doesn't offer much originality but what it lacks in this area it makes up for in spirit. It's a fun, enjoyable film from beginning to end.",4,Texas Western Pulls off the Major Upset,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,5753,"['Glory', 'Road', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'coach', 'Don',

This movie made a joke of the story of this team.Because of this movie, people are given the impression that 5 black freshmen recruited by Coach Don Haskins started in the NCAA Championship game, which amazed sportswriters so much that they were made heavy underdogs because of the prevailing racism of the times. I'd like to point out some facts some people might not know.While I'm sure racism played a factor in real life to some oddsmakers, it had little to do with most people picking Kentucky, the #1 team in the nation at 27-2 and a 4-time National Champion, to beat a team that had never been to a Final Four. It was also widely thought that Kentucky's more fundamental play would prevail over the ""playground ball"" played by Haskell's team as shown in the movie.In the 1950s, prior to Haskins' arrival, Texas Western recruited and played African American players, in a time when it was still common to find all-white college sports teams, particularly in the South. When Haskins arrived in El Paso, he inherited three black players from his coaching predecessor, including Nolan Richardson, the long-time coach of Arkansas.In the 1960's FRESHMEN COULDN'T PLAY VARSITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL. All the starters for Texas Western were upperclassmen.Texas Western didn't ""sneak up"" on anybody. They had been to the NCAA Tournament in 1963 and 1964.Adolph Rupp is depicted in this movie and in pop culture in general as a racist who hated the Texas Western team because they were comprised largely of black players. Quotes from Rupp in fact suggest he was bitter about losing to Haskell's team because of the shady recruiting practices he employed to seemingly win at any cost, and what was seen in the 60's as thuggish behavior by the Texas Western team.I wish Disney had tried to keep the facts straight.

Maybe that was a blessing (a double-blessing), because I would have been disappointed.I'm not saying the movie is BAD, because it isn't. It is hugely important that this story be told over and over so America never forgets how narrow minded people have been, may be and should never be again.The movie captures all the moments and put them together chronologically. They were accurate and well told.My problem with the film falls on the emotional value of it. That may be a weird thing to say, because the movie does have emotional impact, but it needed more emphasis in certain areas. All the things I'm gonna point out were covered, but, in my opinion, weren't FLESHED OUT FULLY ENOUGH.First of all, they needed to emphasize EVEN MORE how CRAZY it was to recruit black athletes in the South. This, to me, is the WHOLE STORY!! Why did Don Haskins do this? The reason given wasn't fully explored in my opinon. What makes a man take a chance like he did? Risking his career and LIFE, not to mention his families lives. More time needed to be spent on recruiting and less on coaching time.The greatness of Don Haskins and what the players of Texas Western did was and will always be about the recruiting. This was the whole point of the movie and the topic was not covered fully.There were players that Coach Rupp of Kentucky REFUSED to recruit. The vindictive and pigheaded boycott of black players in the South was spear-headed by Coach Rupp. He set the standard. They were the juggernaut. They were supposedly unbeatable and the model of the other schools in the region. This was covered so vaguely, I believe it ruined the film.This was the movies nemesis. The racism. The boycott on blacks was lead by Rupp. Yet, it was only a story point later in the film and by then, the point was lost. Quite frankly, by the time Coach Rupp became a story point, his story had lost its punch. It was only brushed over and didn't hold a lot of impact.Finally, the games lacked emotion. Could you image the emotion these kids would have been playing with? With the entire world, it seemed, against them. Yet, it wasn't fully explored. It was only mentioned a handful of times.The movie is good and worth watching, but in my opinion, could have been so much better had they delivered better on these issues. They spent too much time on practices and parties (which were irrelevant) and they failed to give the audience the TRUE FEELING of Texas Western basketball during that incredible season.

Above all they want you to work hard and stay in line because if you do then one day you too can experience true glory. The problem I have with this lesson is that to accomplish it the film has to make you believe that the coach can do wrong. So when he busts out his Gestapo tactics we're supposed to eat it up because we know that in the end they win the national championship. We, here in America, pride ourselves on being anti-tyranny, but this film, and all those mentioned above, have coaches that definitely slant towards the tyrannical. Yet Haskins (Josh Lucas) is portrayed as a hero simply because he gets the job done. Being a Detroit Lions fan I've seen these tactics fail miserably, and yet when Marty Mornhinwig got the boot nobody hypothesized that it might be because of his hyper-aggressive style. One lesson that I found to be spot on was that these kids did not need the approval of Texans or racist boosters.I am a sports fan because I love the unpredictability of it, but sports movies are pretty much anti-climatic by nature. However, I still enjoyed watching the staged drama of this film. Lucas was looking for a star vehicle and at least got a box office victory out of it. More importantly he nails the role and was a lot of fun to watch. I was also glad to see Tatyana Ali get work, although she is quickly reduced to nothing more than a cheerleader. Director James Gartner keeps the filmmaking simple, only occasionally sliding into the fancy. The story basically tells itself and he does nothing to steer it off course. I do question the realism of a few of the scenes. I was especially concerned about the idea that the one game they lost was only because of on court racism. It seems all too simplistic and overly to the point. Also, when Haskins kicks the white kids out of the championship game (just because they're white) they seemed to roll over for him too easily, but I guess that is one upside to running a dictatorship.In the end this film is about racism, using sports as a backdrop. I know the point is to show how far we've come, but I can't help but think that films like this pick at scabs. We all know that being racist is bad and bad for business, so why tell us again? It is, however, to the films credit that they portray Haskins as an overachiever who was dealt a bad hand, as opposed to a civil rights crusader. Yes, he broke down racial walls, but he was really in it for that national championship. ***1/2",3,A Very Familiar Road,1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,3023,"['am', 'recommending', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'especially', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'Miracle', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'essentially', 'same', 'movie', 'Glory', 'Road', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'parade', 'sports', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'gold', 'standard', 'genre', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'film', 'made', 'feel', 'racial', 'pressure', 'characters', 'experienced', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Denzel', 'Washington.This', 'film', 'Disney', 'films', 'lot', 'preach', 'want', 'work', 'hard', 'stay', 'line', 'do', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'too', 'can', 'experience', 'true', 'glory', 'problem', 'have', 'lesson', 'accomplish', 'film', 'make', 'believe', 'coach', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'So', 'when', 'out', 'Gestapo', 'tactics', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'eat', 'up', 'know', 'end', 'win', 'national', 'championship', 'here', 'America', 'pride', 'ourselves', 'being', 'anti-tyranny', 'film', 'mentioned', 'have', 'coaches', 'definitely', 'slant', 'tyrannical', 'Haskins', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'portrayed', 'hero', 'simply', 'job', 'done', 'Being', 'Detroit', 'Lions', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tactics', 'fail', 'miserably', 'yet', 'when', 'Marty', 'Mornhinwig', 'got', 'boot', 'nobody', 'hypothesized', 'might', 'be', 'hyper-aggressive', 'style', 'One', 'lesson', 'found', 'be', 'spot', 'was', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'approval', 'Texans', 'racist', 'boosters.I', 'am', 'sports', 'fan', 'love', 'unpredictability', 'sports', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'anti-climatic', 'nature', 'However', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'staged', 'drama', 'film', 'Lucas', 'was', 'looking', 'star', 'vehicle', 'least', 'got', 'box', 'office', 'victory', 'More', 'importantly', 'role', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'see', 'Tatyana', 'Ali', 'get', 'work', 'quickly', 'reduced', 'nothing', 'more', 'cheerleader', 'Director', 'James', 'Gartner', 'filmmaking', 'simple', 'only', 'occasionally', 'sliding', 'fancy', 'story', 'basically', 'nothing', 'steer', 'off', 'course', 'do', 'question', 'realism', 'few', 'scenes', 'was', 'especially', 'concerned', 'idea', 'one', 'game', 'lost', 'was', 'only', 'court', 'racism', 'too', 'simplistic', 'overly', 'point', 'Also', 'when', 'white', 'kids', 'championship', 'game', 'just', ""'re"", 'white', 'seemed', 'roll', 'over', 'too', 'easily', 'guess', 'one', 'upside', 'running', 'dictatorship.In', 'end', 'film', 'racism', 'using', 'sports', 'backdrop', 'know', 'point', 'show', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'films', 'pick', 'scabs', 'know', 'being', 'racist', 'bad', 'bad', 'business', 'so', 'why', 'tell', 'again', 'however', 'films', 'credit', 'portray', 'Haskins', 'overachiever', 'who', 'was', 'dealt', 'bad', 'hand', 'opposed', 'civil', 'rights', 'crusader', 'Yes', 'broke', 'down', 'racial', 'walls', 'was', 'really', 'national', 'championship', '***1/2']",N/A

Take the typical underdog sports story--coach with something to prove, misfit team, learning to work together and overcome obstacles to become winners.  Cross it with typical feel good overcoming racism story--blacks and whites learn to get along together and stand together against bigotry.  Add lots of inspiring music so you know exactly how you are supposed to feel at any moment--upset, hopeful, inspired, choked up.  Mix in lots of 60s soul music for era authenticity.  And let it roll.Yet...it's still a good movie and a powerful story, of the coach of the first college to start an all-black lineup in the NCAA championship game, but before that becoming a coach who, at a majority non-black school, recruited black players and took them seriously.  No matter how predictable, I came to care about both the coach and his players, and I'm not even that much of a sports fan.  Josh Lucas was fun to watch and looked an awful lot like a young Paul Newman from that same time period where the story takes place (1965).  The best of the extras is a featurette with the real players and coaches from that time, including most of the surviving players from the West Texas team plus others like Pat O'Reilly (who played for Kentucky in that final championship game) talking about their memories of the time and the other players and what the game means to them now some 40 years later.It's also a great movie for family viewing, and effectively shows a not-too-distant time in our past when American life looked totally different if you were not white.

Not only was Texas Western a remote, tiny college operating on a shoestring budget, but it was going up against mammoth Kentucky, and Wildcat legendary coach Adolph Rupp.  Rupp's team had white players only; Haskins' roster included seven black players--five of them started the title game.  Although African-American players already had figured prominently in several national title games prior to 1966, Haskins was the first coach to start five of them.  The season leading up to this historic contest is depicted in Disney Studio's GLORY ROAD.As I've said before (or written, actually), I was so looking forward to seeing this film.  Now I've seen it, and all I can do is express a little disappointment.  Don't get me wrong:  This is a nice-looking, well-made movie, and Josh Lucas does an admirable job portraying fiery coach Don Haskins. . .yet GLORY ROAD lacks what is so essential in the game of basketball.Intensity.Discrimination and bigotry do figure prominently in this film, yet director James Gartner has taken the edge off this gritty issue; what should have fueled the passion of the story instead comes across as Racism Lite.  And the basketball scenes (again, well done) lack the intensity--the grunting, shoving, angry pathos--to feel and look real and believable.  Finally, the historical inaccuracies were in abundant supply--enough to make them annoying and distracting.As an aside, Jon Voight (in some extreme makeup) is absolutely spellbinding as ""old school"" coach Adolph Rupp.  Voight steals every single scene he's in (but there's not a lot of competition).GLORY ROAD reminds me of a pizza with just the crust and a smothering of sauce; there are numerous missing ingredients that make it less than satisfying.

And who can forget Teresa Weatherspoon's desperation shot in the WNBA finals against Houston?Sure these plots seem to repeat themselves but so do other types of stories -- that's the essence of hero's-journey narrative. Each version has a slightly different twist. Here we have the issue of race and the unknown college in the middle of nowhere.Other reviewers pointed out that the coach needed five years - not just one - to win against Kentucky.

Heart of the Game shows a coach who did struggle for years to win championships and, if anything, watching the growth of those years adds to the impact. (Of course, ""Heart"" was a documentary and this is ""based on"" history.)And I think the film coulud have captured some of the ""meaner"" side of the coach for additional impact. Pat Summitt doesn't describe herself as mean but in her own books, she pulls no punches: once she made the team practice after a big loss -- in their worn, sweat-soaked uniforms. And she ran big drills after suspecting the team had had a night out on the town. Great coaches often horrify outsiders, but have no trouble recruiting and maintaining great players.So a glimpse of the love-hate relationship players have with a ""mean"" coach would  add a 3-dimensional component, although the film is far from sappy. We're spared slow romantic interludes and we get a good amount of fast court action by players wearing those old-style shorts.To put Glory Road in context, let's remember that today the top women's colleges play just as hard and just as well as the guys did back then. Maybe better. Hopefully some day we'll have documentaries and re-enactments of the backward 21st century's first decade, when women's basketball got the worst TV time slots (rarely on the major networks) and WNBA stories were relegated to a few brief inches in the back part of the sports section.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[6, 8]","GLORY ROAD is the story of the 1966 men's basketball team of the university of West Texas (modern day University of Texas El Paso, or UTEP for short).  Remarkably, this small school won the national championship in '66 against perennial powerhouse Kentucky.  The movie details everything ""behind the scenes"" that went on during the season.So what makes their story so extraordinary?  you ask.  Well, it was the first time that an all-black squad won the title.  This was (and still is) a VERY big deal and will always be remembered as a pivotal time for college athletics.  During the tumultuous 60s, in the middle of Vietnam, the Civil Rights movement & everything else, the West Texas basketball team served as a beacon of hope to all people - not just those of African American origin.I am not from Kentucky.  I am well aware of the accusations that have come down through the decades about legendary coach Adolph Rupp being a racist.  Some people swear he was a die-hard racist, while other people argue this aspect of his character was overblown.  I have no idea which camp is right.  However, what I do know is that the film-makers didn't over-do his alleged racist attitudes in the making of this movie.  His character is kept on the subtle side, and I think that was a good touch.If you like sports movies, this one is a ""must-have"" for your DVD collection.

We'd seen the trailers for ""Glory Road,"" each of us drawn in by the humor and drama.  But would it hold up against other great sports films?  Would it keep the attention of my twelve and fourteen year old daughters?No need to worry.  We were spellbound, when we weren't laughing at the frequent comedic moments.  Often times, filmmakers who go about retelling true stories fail to breathe new life into their subjects; they try to stick rigidly to the facts, or they manipulate them in an effort to create more drama.  ""Glory Road"" sidesteps both mistakes and gives a faithful, thought-provoking glimpse into the transformation of a young college basketball team into a national championship squad.The year was 1966, and unknown Texas Western vaulted into the public spotlight with a group of predominately black players.  The fact that the team kept winning, and the ability of the black athletes to play intelligently under pressure--despite rumors that such a thing was impossible--made them groundbreakers.  Coach Haskins' belief in his ballplayers went beyond color, and his years of successful coaching and his induction into the Hall of Fame confirmed it.  The special features provide some more insight into those involved in that year of destiny, including a player on the opposing Kentucky Wildcats, Pat Riley.  I did wish for at least a few minutes of footage from that historic game, but all evidence suggests the movie was very consistent with reality.This is a story worth retelling, and it's been done so with fantastic nuance, never becoming melodramatic while also never losing sight of its significance.",5,A Fantastic Retelling,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,1696,"['family', 'plopped', 'down', 'couch', 'two', 'hours', 'entertainment', ""'d"", 'seen', 'trailers', 'Glory', 'Road', 'drawn', 'humor', 'drama', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'other', 'great', 'sports', 'films', 'Would', 'keep', 'attention', 'twelve', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'daughters', 'need', 'worry', 'were', 'spellbound', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'frequent', 'comedic', 'moments', 'Often', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'go', 'retelling', 'true', 'stories', 'fail', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'subjects', 'try', 'stick', 'rigidly', 'facts', 'manipulate', 'effort', 'create', 'more', 'drama', 'Glory', 'Road', 'mistakes', 'faithful', 'thought-provoking', 'glimpse', 'transformation', 'young', 'college', 'basketball', 'team', 'national', 'championship', 'squad.The', 'year', 'was', '1966', 'unknown', 'Texas', 'Western', 'vaulted', 'public', 'spotlight', 'group', 'predominately', 'black', 'players', 'fact', 'team', 'kept', 'winning', 'ability', 'black', 'athletes', 'play', 'intelligently', 'pressure', 'rumors', 'thing', 'was', 'impossible', 'made', 'groundbreakers', 'Coach', 'Haskins', 'belief', 'ballplayers', 'went', 'color', 'years', 'successful', 'coaching', 'induction', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'confirmed', 'special', 'features', 'provide', 'more', 'insight', 'involved', 'year', 'destiny', 'including', 'player', 'opposing', 'Kentucky', 'Wildcats', 'Pat', 'Riley', 'did', 'wish', 'least', 'few', 'minutes', 'footage', 'historic', 'game', 'evidence', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'consistent', 'reality.This', 'story', 'worth', 'retelling', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'fantastic', 'nuance', 'never', 'becoming', 'melodramatic', 'also', 'never', 'losing', 'sight', 'significance']",N/A
980471,A100UD67AHFODS,B000EXZFCQ,"Expressed Reviews ""Expressed Reviews""","[4, 6]","Glory Road ranks right up there with Hoosiers as one of my all time favorite sports films. Against seemingly impossible odds, Coach Don Haskins, portrayed by Josh Lucas, takes Texas Western College on a course that changed the face of collegiate athletics forever. Unheard of at the time, and facing overwhelming hate mail and other forms of prejudice, Haskins goes against the tide by starting an all-black lineup for the first time in NCAA championship history. As highlighted in the movie, color was not a deciding factor in his choice of players for this upstart team. The Texas Western Miners upset the University of Kentucky to win the national title, a win that symbolized a breakthrough for blacks in college sports. While all the facts may not be true to form, the film eloquently highlights the struggles that both the black and white players faced during a time of widespread racial hatred in this country. Sad to say that a lot of the same prejudice and hatred that is rampant in the film, is still present in society some 40 years later. This was a very turbulent time in American History, with the Vietnam war in full escalation mode. For an all black NCAA championship team to take the spotlight away from the war, for at least a brief moment in time, says a lot about the significance of this game and the players that played in it. This is an emotional, heartfelt film, with exceptional performances by Lucas and Jon Voight, who performs a memorable cameo appearance as legendary Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp. It wasn't until the final credits rolled that I realized that the role of Coach Rupp was played by Voight. Telling of the times, when Texas Western wins the NCAA championship, you see Rupp sitting on the bench, with his head down toward his lap, instead of him congratulating Coach Haskins for the spectacular upset that his team just pulled off.",5,"A Great Film About Sports, Prejudice, Conviction, And Character",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1871,"['Glory', 'Road', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Hoosiers', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'sports', 'films', 'Against', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'odds', 'Coach', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'portrayed', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Texas', 'Western', 'College', 'course', 'changed', 'face', 'collegiate', 'athletics', 'forever', 'Unheard', 'time', 'facing', 'overwhelming', 'hate', 'mail', 'other', 'forms', 'prejudice', 'Haskins', 'tide', 'starting', 'all-black', 'lineup', 'first', 'time', 'NCAA', 'championship', 'history', 'highlighted', 'movie', 'color', 'was', 'not', 'deciding', 'factor', 'choice', 'players', 'upstart', 'team', 'Texas', 'Western', 'Miners', 'upset', 'University', 'Kentucky', 'win', 'national', 'title', 'win', 'symbolized', 'breakthrough', 'blacks', 'college', 'sports', 'facts', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'form', 'film', 'eloquently', 'struggles', 'both', 'black', 'white', 'players', 'faced', 'time', 'widespread', 'racial', 'hatred', 'country', 'Sad', 'say', 'lot', 'same', 'prejudice', 'hatred', 'rampant', 'film', 'still', 'present', 'society', '40', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'very', 'turbulent', 'time', 'American', 'History', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'full', 'escalation', 'mode', 'black', 'NCAA', 'championship', 'team', 'take', 'spotlight', 'away', 'war', 'least', 'brief', 'moment', 'time', 'lot', 'significance', 'game', 'players', 'played', 'emotional', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'Lucas', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'who', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'legendary', 'Kentucky', 'coach', 'Adolph', 'Rupp', 'was', ""n't"", 'final', 'credits', 'rolled', 'realized', 'role', 'Coach', 'Rupp', 'was', 'played', 'Voight', 'Telling', 'times', 'when', 'Texas', 'Western', 'NCAA', 'championship', 'see', 'Rupp', 'sitting', 'bench', 'head', 'down', 'lap', 'instead', 'congratulating', 'Coach', 'Haskins', 'spectacular', 'upset', 'team', 'just', 'pulled', 'off']",N/A

980473,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B000EXZFCQ,Isaac,"[12, 15]","From the powerful ""Hoosiers"" to last year's excellent ""Coach Carter,"" we have witnessed a number of basketball films in which a coach takes command of a team of underdogs, nourishes their skills through a rough season, and takes them all the way to the Big Game. In short, you have seen ""Glory Road"" before, even if you haven't purchased a ticket yet.You are familiar with all of the cliches: the coach, and the players, face hardships on and off the courts, moments of in-game suspense are established by slow-motion, and the ending is so foreseen that you can bet your life on what will happen. But somewhere between the first scene and the end credits, I forgot that I had seen this done before, and I left the theater inspired.""Glory Road"" tells the story of Texas Western University's 1966 championship victory over the intimidating Kentuky Wildcats and the journey they took to get there. The newly hired coach, Don Haskins (Josh Lucas), takes a bold step in hiring a number of black players, all of whom, he believes, are undiscovered talent waiting to be put in the spotlight. It was this move that began to breakdown the racial barriers not just in the NCAA, but in the United States, and the segregation issues that existed in that time are heavily studied in a number of the film's sequences.First, there is the matter of the players already playing for Texas Western, who must accept the presence of their new teammates. Then there is the matter of school officials, who, naturally, find Haskins' methods of recruiting unorthodox. Finally, there are the opinions of the media, who will find it insane that that Haskins would recruit talented black players and, eventually, start five black players in the national championship game.But the aspects of the players is not what makes ""Glory Road"" an excellent film. What makes this an excellent film is that we get to know the players, their struggles, and their personal histories; the well coreographed game scenes that accurately portray what actually happened during the games are more like extra goodies. Chief among the new players are Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke) and Willie Scoops Cager (Damaine Radcliff), who introduce a new style of basketball that would later become an influence to the modern principles of the sport. Their style conflicts with the style that Haskins believes in, and in one memorable scene, when his team his down, he orders Hill to play the game his way and they arise victorious.Another key character is Kentuky head coach Adolph Rupp, an inspired and firey performance by John Voight. He knows that Texas Western is making history as they progress through the season and into the championship game, which he why refers to them as ""a special team"" during one of his timeouts. Given the historical context of his first name in relationship to racism, you would think that ""Glory Road"" establishes him as a villain, but it doesn't. The film just sits back and observes the arrogance of Rupp and other individuals during that time who were rooting for Kentuky just because Haskins had black players on his team. The film doesn't pick sides. It presents both of them, so graphically in one scene that it pushes the barriers of the PG rating. It's not being biased in favor of the black players. It paints an honest portrait of what happened.The performances are excellent, with Josh Lucas playing Coach Haskins in a role that should be talked about for a while. However, the film's spirit doesn't totally lie in the powerful depiction of it's characters, but in what happens after the events of the story, and most of it's awesomeness comes out of what we know now. If there wasn't a Coach Haskins who recruited a Bobby Joe Hill, then there would have probably never been a Michael Jordan, a Lebron James, or an Allen Iverson. ""Glory Road"" is inevitably a valuable history lesson, which we are still learning in our society today, and like ""Crash,"" it establishes the lesson by showing victimization and antagonization.I suppose that's what sets ""Glory Road"" apart from most other sports films: the race relationship is just as important as the game. Making ends meet through a checklist of sports cliches, director James Gartner and screenwriters Christopher Cleveland and Bettina Gilois deserve much respect for what they have accomplished. But the film makes a very haunting point in its context. Although its amazing how far we have come in the past forty years in race relations, we still have a long way to go. - IsaacRated PG; 106 minutes; Directed James Gartner",5,Glory Road,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,4556,"['powerful', 'Hoosiers', 'last', 'year', 'excellent', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'have', 'witnessed', 'number', 'basketball', 'films', 'coach', 'command', 'team', 'underdogs', 'nourishes', 'skills', 'rough', 'season', 'way', 'Big', 'Game', 'short', 'have', 'seen', 'Glory', 'Road', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'purchased', 'ticket', 'yet.You', 'are', 'familiar', 'cliches', 'coach', 'players', 'face', 'hardships', 'courts', 'moments', 'in-game', 'suspense', 'are', 'established', 'slow-motion', 'ending', 'so', 'foreseen', 'can', 'bet', 'life', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'somewhere', 'first', 'scene', 'end', 'credits', 'forgot', 'had', 'seen', 'done', 'left', 'theater', 'inspired', 'Glory', 'Road', 'story', 'Texas', 'Western', 'University', '1966', 'championship', 'victory', 'intimidating', 'Kentuky', 'Wildcats', 'journey', 'took', 'get', 'there', 'newly', 'hired', 'coach', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'bold', 'step', 'hiring', 'number', 'black', 'players', 'whom', 'are', 'undiscovered', 'talent', 'waiting', 'be', 'put', 'spotlight', 'was', 'move', 'began', 'breakdown', 'racial', 'barriers', 'not', 'just', 'NCAA', 'United', 'States', 'segregation', 'issues', 'existed', 'time', 'are', 'heavily', 'studied', 'number', 'film', 'sequences.First', 'matter', 'players', 'already', 'playing', 'Texas', 'Western', 'who', 'must', 'accept', 'presence', 'new', 'teammates', 'Then', 'matter', 'school', 'officials', 'who', 'naturally', 'find', 'Haskins', 'methods', 'recruiting', 'unorthodox', 'Finally', 'are', 'opinions', 'media', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'insane', 'Haskins', 'would', 'recruit', 'talented', 'black', 'players', 'eventually', 'start', 'five', 'black', 'players', 'national', 'championship', 'game.But', 'aspects', 'players', 'not', 'what', 'Glory', 'Road', 'excellent', 'film', 'What', 'excellent', 'film', 'get', 'know', 'players', 'struggles', 'personal', 'histories', 'well', 'coreographed', 'game', 'scenes', 'accurately', 'portray', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'games', 'are', 'more', 'extra', 'goodies', 'Chief', 'new', 'players', 'are', 'Bobby', 'Joe', 'Hill', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Willie', 'Scoops', 'Cager', 'Damaine', 'Radcliff', 'who', 'introduce', 'new', 'style', 'basketball', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'influence', 'modern', 'principles', 'sport', 'style', 'conflicts', 'style', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'when', 'team', 'down', 'orders', 'Hill', 'play', 'game', 'way', 'arise', 'victorious.Another', 'key', 'character', 'Kentuky', 'head', 'coach', 'Adolph', 'Rupp', 'inspired', 'firey', 'performance', 'John', 'Voight', 'Texas', 'Western', 'making', 'history', 'progress', 'season', 'championship', 'game', 'why', 'refers', 'special', 'team', 'one', 'timeouts', 'Given', 'historical', 'context', 'first', 'name', 'relationship', 'racism', 'would', 'think', 'Glory', 'Road', 'villain', ""n't"", 'film', 'just', 'back', 'arrogance', 'Rupp', 'other', 'individuals', 'time', 'who', 'were', 'rooting', 'Kentuky', 'just', 'Haskins', 'had', 'black', 'players', 'team', 'film', ""n't"", 'pick', 'sides', 'so', 'graphically', 'one', 'scene', 'barriers', 'PG', 'rating', 'not', 'being', 'biased', 'favor', 'black', 'players', 'honest', 'portrait', 'what', 'happened.The', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'playing', 'Coach', 'Haskins', 'role', 'should', 'be', 'talked', 'while', 'However', 'film', 'spirit', ""n't"", 'totally', 'lie', 'powerful', 'depiction', 'characters', 'what', 'events', 'story', 'most', 'awesomeness', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'was', ""n't"", 'Coach', 'Haskins', 'who', 'recruited', 'Bobby', 'Joe', 'Hill', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'never', 'been', 'Michael', 'Jordan', 'Lebron', 'James', 'Allen', 'Iverson', 'Glory', 'Road', 'inevitably', 'valuable', 'history', 'lesson', 'are', 'still', 'learning', 'society', 'today', 'Crash', 'lesson', 'showing', 'victimization', 'antagonization.I', 'suppose', 'what', 'Glory', 'Road', 'apart', 'most', 'other', 'sports', 'films', 'race', 'relationship', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'game', 'Making', 'ends', 'meet', 'checklist', 'sports', 'cliches', 'director', 'James', 'Gartner', 'screenwriters', 'Christopher', 'Cleveland', 'Bettina', 'Gilois', 'deserve', 'much', 'respect', 'what', 'have', 'accomplished', 'film', 'very', 'haunting', 'point', 'context', 'amazing', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come', 'past', 'forty', 'years', 'race', 'relations', 'still', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'IsaacRated', 'PG', '106', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'James', 'Gartner']",N/A

The only thing similiar is how a sports tema was integrated much to the dislike of the local community.  Remember the Titans was a great story as Glory Road However what made Titans seem even better was becuase of the Actors They had oscar conenders Denzel Washington and Will Patton while the star of Glory Road is Josh Lucas so sometimes it is the actuing that makes a movie better. Titans beats Glory Road in the acting department hands down.Glory Road is a great story on its own though. Glory Road is the latest in a long line of Sports Dramas based on true stories. Glory road tells the story of a coah who started 5 black players a first in NCAA history and drew controversy and violence from the local community they were outraged. and then when it came down to the NCCA Championship again it was 5 Black players against an all white Kentucky powerhouse team. And teh game went down as probably the biggest upset in NCAA history when Texas Western defeated Kentucky to win the 1966 NCAA Championship and still is one of the greatest games in NCAA History. This is the story of that game and the events leading up to it. I reccomend you to see it. Granted it is not the best sports drama. it is from the studio who bought you Remember The Titans The Walt Disney Company and Jerry Bruckheimer. Remember The titans beats it hand down in acting as said but the stories are very similiar accept this one it is more racially oriented violence then there was in Titans. Disney is goign to continue to bring these sports dramas out this one is a bit different becuase they actually show more of the blood and violence of the story behind it unlike previous Sports dramas from Disney that are more  family friendly. So whoever said Disney does not make a movie that cannot appeal to everyone is wrong.,4,A Good Story Of One Of The Greatestest NCAA Games In History,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1884,"['First', 'alot', 'comparisons', 'movie', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'only', 'thing', 'similiar', 'how', 'sports', 'tema', 'was', 'integrated', 'much', 'dislike', 'local', 'community', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'Glory', 'Road', 'However', 'what', 'made', 'Titans', 'seem', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'becuase', 'Actors', 'had', 'oscar', 'conenders', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Will', 'Patton', 'star', 'Glory', 'Road', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'so', 'sometimes', 'actuing', 'movie', 'better', 'Titans', 'beats', 'Glory', 'Road', 'acting', 'department', 'down.Glory', 'Road', 'great', 'story', 'own', 'though', 'Glory', 'Road', 'latest', 'long', 'line', 'Sports', 'Dramas', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'Glory', 'road', 'story', 'coah', 'who', 'started', '5', 'black', 'players', 'first', 'NCAA', 'history', 'drew', 'controversy', 'violence', 'local', 'community', 'were', 'outraged', 'then', 'when', 'came', 'down', 'NCCA', 'Championship', 'again', 'was', '5', 'Black', 'players', 'white', 'Kentucky', 'powerhouse', 'team', 'teh', 'game', 'went', 'down', 'as', 'probably', 'biggest', 'upset', 'NCAA', 'history', 'when', 'Texas', 'Western', 'defeated', 'Kentucky', 'win', '1966', 'NCAA', 'Championship', 'still', 'one', 'greatest', 'games', 'NCAA', 'History', 'story', 'game', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'reccomend', 'see', 'Granted', 'not', 'best', 'sports', 'drama', 'studio', 'who', 'bought', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'Remember', 'titans', 'beats', 'hand', 'down', 'acting', 'said', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'similiar', 'one', 'more', 'racially', 'oriented', 'violence', 'then', 'was', 'Titans', 'Disney', 'goign', 'continue', 'bring', 'sports', 'dramas', 'out', 'one', 'bit', 'different', 'becuase', 'actually', 'show', 'more', 'blood', 'violence', 'story', 'previous', 'Sports', 'dramas', 'Disney', 'are', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'So', 'whoever', 'said', 'Disney', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'wrong']",N/A
980476,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000EXZFCQ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","We see more and more of these films and that rejuvenates my heart and my mind tremendously. Here it is about the 1966 NCAA Basket Ball competition in which Texas Western lined up the first ever all black basket ball team in the final game, and the black players were a majority in the team from the very start. The film is decent about the difficulties encountered by the coach who made that choice: make them respect his rule, his rhythm and his life discipline while training and then competing; make them live with their differences inside the team, and with the hostility of many outside the team; make them accept to play a unified game as a team even if some would like to play their own personal games. And there are many others. He managed to keep them united even for the final game when he decided to have an all black team then, the white players becoming privileged supporters. Was he conscious he was setting an objective that went a long way beyond the game itself? How can we know? It is sure today that it was a milestone in the civil rights struggle, at least it became one: the 1966 declaration of independence of black basketball players at the national level. The extremely important dimension of this film is that it is not only saying or showing the blacks are better, because after all they might not be better, but showing that their game, their way of playing is better because they are able to unify their ambitions within the whole team and to integrate their white team mates even when it might be considered like bringing the wolf among the sheep by taking them to an all black party one week-end. The film shows how much the civil rights struggle was an all-race team struggle. Without the support of some whites in the public as well as in the hierarchy the struggle might have been a lot longer and even a lot less successful. That has to be said over and over again and demonstrated with as many case studies as possible. That's what Ralph Ellison demonstrated in his books: blacks are invisible but to become visible to whites it is some of these whites who have to open their eyes and see. Without these white eyes seeing the blacks around them, the blacks cannot become visible, no matter what they do. In fact everything they may do might even make them more invisible or might justify some into making these blacks become invisible by erasing them from the picture. And that attitude, so well illustrated in this film, has to be the model for us to deal with all the groups of people who are different from us, no matter what this ""us"" might stand for.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,We are best in our united differences,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,2677,"['see', 'more', 'more', 'films', 'heart', 'mind', 'tremendously', 'Here', '1966', 'NCAA', 'Basket', 'Ball', 'competition', 'Texas', 'Western', 'lined', 'up', 'first', 'ever', 'black', 'basket', 'ball', 'team', 'final', 'game', 'black', 'players', 'were', 'majority', 'team', 'very', 'start', 'film', 'decent', 'difficulties', 'encountered', 'coach', 'who', 'made', 'choice', 'make', 'respect', 'rule', 'rhythm', 'life', 'discipline', 'training', 'then', 'competing', 'make', 'live', 'differences', 'team', 'hostility', 'many', 'team', 'make', 'accept', 'play', 'unified', 'game', 'team', 'even', 'would', 'like', 'play', 'own', 'personal', 'games', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'managed', 'keep', 'united', 'even', 'final', 'game', 'when', 'decided', 'have', 'black', 'team', 'then', 'white', 'players', 'becoming', 'privileged', 'supporters', 'Was', 'conscious', 'was', 'setting', 'objective', 'went', 'long', 'way', 'game', 'How', 'can', 'know', 'sure', 'today', 'was', 'milestone', 'civil', 'rights', 'struggle', 'least', 'became', 'one', '1966', 'declaration', 'independence', 'black', 'basketball', 'players', 'national', 'level', 'extremely', 'important', 'dimension', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'saying', 'showing', 'blacks', 'are', 'better', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'showing', 'game', 'way', 'playing', 'better', 'are', 'able', 'unify', 'ambitions', 'whole', 'team', 'integrate', 'white', 'team', 'mates', 'even', 'when', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'bringing', 'wolf', 'sheep', 'taking', 'black', 'party', 'one', 'week-end', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'civil', 'rights', 'struggle', 'was', 'all-race', 'team', 'struggle', 'support', 'whites', 'public', 'as', 'well', 'hierarchy', 'struggle', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'longer', 'even', 'lot', 'less', 'successful', 'be', 'said', 'over', 'again', 'demonstrated', 'as', 'many', 'case', 'studies', 'possible', 'what', 'Ralph', 'Ellison', 'demonstrated', 'books', 'blacks', 'are', 'invisible', 'become', 'visible', 'whites', 'whites', 'who', 'have', 'open', 'eyes', 'see', 'white', 'eyes', 'seeing', 'blacks', 'blacks', 'can', 'not', 'become', 'visible', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'fact', 'everything', 'may', 'do', 'might', 'even', 'make', 'more', 'invisible', 'might', 'justify', 'making', 'blacks', 'become', 'invisible', 'erasing', 'picture', 'attitude', 'so', 'well', 'illustrated', 'film', 'be', 'model', 'deal', 'groups', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'matter', 'what', 'might', 'stand', 'for.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

980484,A1UUVQS8X31RH1,B000EXZFCQ,Kalie A. Gipson,"[14, 17]","""Glory Road"" tells the story of the Texas Western Miners, a college basketball team who won the NCAA Championship in 1966. But this wasn't just an ordinary championship, no, for the starting line-up in the championship game was all Black players, a thing that was unheard of in '66. Or better yet, even a black player being recruited by a college team was out of the ordinary. However, the 36 year old coach Don Haskins recruited seven Black players for his Texas Western team (when the season begins, he starts three of those players). The team was barely even thought of in the college world before then, then with the help of the seven black players, they went on to win the championship.The movie opens with a girls basketball game, and you see that Don Haskins coaches girl's basketball. Later on, he is asked to coach Division 1 basketball, for the Texas Western team (with one drawback; he would have to live in the dorm room with his wife and kids). Then, he sets out to recruit players that would help the team win. When he recruits all Black players, it's obvious that most people (even the Black players themselves) thought Haskins was crazy. Among the players he recruited were Bobby Jo Hill (played exceptionally by Derek Luke), Willie Cager, David Lattin, and Harry Flournoy. His practices for the team were intense and his rules were strict. This would all pay off in the end though, with the Miners winning the championship over Adolf Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats (with Pat Riley, who is a character in the movie, it's weird to hear his name called while he's playing, knowing he's a game-winning coach with plenty of rings).The movie does depict the racism at the time as well. It wasn't an easy ride for the coach or the Black players on the team. In the first game, the fans clapped for the two starting white players, but the whole arena was quiet when the Black players were announced. The team had racial slurs written in their hotel room during their game. One player was even beat up in a bathroom. Haskins was harassed as well. The racism almost tore the team apart, but with the coach's help they stayed together and changed the course of basketball.All around, the acting was great. Josh Lucas did a great job as Coach Haskins, completely becoming his character. Derek Luke did great as Bobby Jo Hill. Jon Voight played Kentucky coach Adolf Rupp, but you wouldn't really know unless you read the credits. Nonetheless he did a great job. Mehcad Brooks, Sam Jones III, Schin A.S. Kerr and Damaine Radcliff (who played Flournoy, Worsley, Lattin, and Cager, respectively) all did excellent in their roles. The actors practically become the players. The cast couldn't have been better.Overall, Disney has released another superb movie about sports underdogs winning it all (I enjoyed Remember The Titans as well). If you like that movie, there's no way you'll dislike this. It is a well-cast, well-directed movie that will satisfy any basketball fan, and will keep everyone watching. It's been said that it follows the cliches of all other similar movies, but don't we always watch them anyway?The film triumphantly shows how one coach changed the game (and face) of basketball completely. One quote from the film is ""You're acting like negroes are gonna be the future of basketball!"" and I couldn't help but laugh when that line was said. The importance and significance of that season and the tribulations of the team is wonderfully shown.

980485,A1IOJE0W1NXOSE,B000EXZFCQ,Karen Potts,"[0, 3]","Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) is thrilled to get a coaching job at Texas Western, until he discovers that they have very few good players and no budget for recruiting.  Undaunted, he scours the country for recruits, no matter what their color.  This is the mid-60's and no NCAA top-tier team in the south has any black players.  The black and white players whom Haskins recruits first need to learn to play as a team.  Hostility between players gives way to an amused tolerance as the young men begin to socialize and discover that they are not so different after all.  One of the funniest scenes in the movie shows a tall white player doing his best to keep up with his black team mates' dance moves.  Things are not easy, as bigoted fans give the Miners a hard time, even to the point of vandalizing their hotel rooms, and beating up one of the players.

His ""Glory Road"" attests to that.  As others have stated, writers Chris Cleveland and Bettina Gelois loosened up quite a bit with the accuracy of the events that lead up to Texas Western's 1966 showdown with college basketball juggernaut, Kentucky, in order to make the tale even more of an underdog tale than it actually was.  Things start out with coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) being offered a shot at coaching Division I college ball at Texas Western (eventually  UT-El Paso).  When he's handed the reins of the basketball team, he learns he must live with his family in the dormitory with the players.  He also quickly learns that he has very little funding to go out and recruit legitimate college basketball talent.  After a number of rejections, Haskins heads out to recruit black players and eventually attracts seven of them to the west Texas town of El Paso.  Things take a dramatic turn as Haskins' team wins game after game.  Along the way, they are faced with countless derogatory remarks, they get spit on, they get beat up, receive death threats, etc.  Mind you, this doesn't just happen to the black players.  The viewer is made well aware of the fact that the white boys playing on the team draw their fair share of racist heat as well.  Haskins and his family receive death threats and, in typical college sports movie style, the alumni association threatens to pull its support of the team.  When the pressure really turns up, the black players turn on their white teammates, showing that racism doesn't always come from one side of the court.  In the end, the players, the NCAA, and, hopefully, all of America comes to realize that skin color doesn't make you what you are, it's what's inside that really matters.As stated before, the writers took great liberties with this story.  In fact, they took so many that I don't really know what did and didn't actually happen.  For this reason, I'm forced to take a star away from the rating of this movie.  I really must admit that it's nice to see a film in which racial tensions not only affect the black people in the film, but the white people as well.Overall, the film is quite enjoyable to watch.  Jon Voight is nearly unrecognizable as Kentucky legend, Adolph Rupp.  He does a wonderful job in a true scene-stealing role.  It's been stated by others that Rupp never was the racist that he is portrayed to be in this film.  Much like Lane Frost's father in the equally wonderful ""8 Seconds,"" I feel that dramatic license was taken with the character in order to further solidify the ""underdog"" aspect of the film.This movie really is a wonder to watch.  Great music, wonderful cinematography, and solid direction make for a nice film.  It has drama, comedy, and even a little suspense (even though we all know the outcome).  I highly recommend it.  Others have compared it to ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Coach Carter.""  I have yet to see either of these films but plan to check them both out soon due to their solid recommendations here.  I can say that I've watched two of Disney's other recent sports flicks and recommend them if you enjoy ""Glory Road.""  Those films are ""The Rookie"" with Dennis Quaid and ""Miracle"" starring Kurt Russell.  I also recommend ""8 Seconds"" and ""Hoosiers.""  One is the story of rodeo legend, Lane Frost, and the other should need no explanation at all.""Glory Road"" is a wonderful sports film.  Look past the historical inaccuracies and you'll find that this is a good family film for anyone eight years or older.

980488,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000EXZFCQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 5]","Oh, the sports movie. The underdog victorious. There are lots of cliches in film, but nothing quite compares to the formulaic telling of the inspirational, crowd-pleasing sports story. Having seen two recent films set in the world of competitive basketball--I've realized the ""game"" is not always the thing. While generally these films can build tension with slow motion photography and good music montages, it's a rare movie that can overcome its limitations to really stand apart from the dozens of similar stories.""Coach Carter"" tells the true life story of Ken Carter, a high school coach who emphasized academics over basketball. By valuing the educational system, this is a nice example of a man who wanted to help develop well-rounded and successful young men. As you may expect, you've got the requisite ""types"" on the team--but what stands apart is the tough, compassionate, and accomplished performance of Samuel L. Jackson. Maybe heavy handed at times, ""Coach Carter"" dares to tell a basketball story where basketball is just one component of success in the life of the players. This was a controversial man, in his time, because he dared to shut down a successful team for something more important--and that's a fine message in what becomes a powerful film.""Glory Road,"" of course, tells (arguably) a more significant story. The plot depicted here, about racism and integration of college sports, had serious repercussions to the development of the athletic arena as it now exists. But, ultimately, I felt singularly less connected to this film from an emotional standpoint. Don Haskins, played by Josh Lucas, was hired as head coach by Texas Western University. With no budget for recruitment, he traveled the United States and ending up assembling a team consisting largely of black players. Here, academics are only giving passing mention--basketball is the thing. The first half of the picture is full of mildly racial banter between the local players and the new recruits--it's almost perpetuating it's own stereotype. And the last half is composed of more overt acts of racism. But neither half is done in a particularly realistic or involving way, it's a paint by numbers portrait of a difficult topic.Between the two films, I definitely feel as if ""Coach Carter"" spent more time in character development--and ultimately I think that's why it's more effective. I felt as if Jackson let me know the man and his motivations, so that his interactions with his family and team became relevant (even if all the characters were not fully fleshed out). Lucas, on the other hand, was left considerably less developed by his script--and the film falters for this. For example, we know nothing of substance about his wife and, following the first 10 minutes of the film, he seems to completely neglect his own kids. Hence, ""Glory Road"" becomes all surface and little depth.But this lack of adequate character development has larger implications because sports movies ask you to get caught up in the games. While ""Glory Road"" has one of the most significant upsets in basketball history depicted--it's game is genuinely less involving that the final contest of ""Coach Carter."" Why? Because ""Carter"" has earned our emotional involvement. ""Glory Road"" just expects it.I'm scoring ""Coach Carter"" at a solid 4 stars. Great performances and a good message rank this a cut above. ""Glory Road"" is about 2 1/2 stars. Adequate performances in a weaker script and an underdeveloped, but important message, keep this one grounded.

980492,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EXZFCQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","In the old Western Athletic Conference, the University of Texas El Paso (formerly Texas Western) and the University of New Mexico were paired up in the scheduling so that the regular season finale was usually the Miners coming to the Pit in Albuquerque to play the Lobos.  So I have seen Don Haskins, a.k.a. ""The Bear,"" sitting on the bench with his familiar towel in his hands a half-dozen times in person, and even way back when was aware that the guy had won the NCAA title the last time John Wooden had not with UCLA (just think, if freshmen had been eligibly in 1966, Texas Western would have had to get by Lew Alcindor's Bruins).  ""Glory Road"" tells the story of that championship season and how Haskins was the first to start five black players in the championship game.  That they were playing five white starters of Adolph Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats.  The game is considered the most important college basketball game every played, and while there are those who will argue the point, this 2006 totally embraces the idea that this game was some sort of Emancipation Proclamation for the game.Haskins (Josh Lucas), takes his wife Mary (Emily Deschanel) and young family to Texas Western so he can coach Division I college basketball (instead of a high school girls team).  He starts trying to recruit players, but going to a mining college in El Paso is not appealing.  But then, while recruiting somebody else, Haskins sees Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke) come off the bench and run circles around everybody else.  Everybody tells Haskins not to start recruiting black players, but he gets seven of them to come from as far away as Gary, Indiana and the South Bronx.  Haskins gets them to play basketball his way (big time emphasis on conditioning and defense) and by the end of the movie they are playing for the national championship.  The film makes it seem like this all happened in Haskin's first season as coach, but he began coaching there in 1961 (the team already had three blacks on the roster at that point, including future Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson), and 1966 was his third time in the NCAA tournament (with a NIT appearance thrown in as well).  For a film that celebrates history, there are a lot of liberties being taken with the fact, and while I know this is always the case in films based on true stories, I really think they go a bit too far here.This movie tells the story of the 1966 Texas Western team overplaying its social significance.  Stories covering the game when it happened did not comment on the black versus white angle, and in interviews the players said they never saw it that way either.  But that is all anybody is talking about in this movie.  Ultimately, ""Glory Road"" made me think that the story was not that Haskins started five blacks for Texas Western, but rather that Rupp's Kentucky was still starting five whites.  For a long time I thought that 1966 was the first time that half the players on the court for the NCAA Championship were black, but in the 1963 title game Loyola University (Chicago) started four blacks and beat two-time defending champ Cincinnati, who started three.  Go back to the University of San Francisco in 1956 and Bill Russell's team had five blacks, although they did not all start.  In 1958 the All-American team picked by the coaches was all black, and included future Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, and Elgin Baylor.  So every time in this film that some idiot starts talking about how blacks are not smart enough to play college basketball game you want to ask them to explain the Boston Celtics.Adolph Rupp (Jon Voight) becomes a problematic character because the story being told by screenwriters Chris Cleveland and Bettina Gilois really does not work unless Rupp is a racist (even if his wife is not).  There are deleted scenes involving Rupp responding to a reporter's challenge as to why he does not have any blacks at Kentucky and in an elevator with Haskins where he admits perhaps the game has passed him by that run counter to the way the story is being told, so it is not surprising they are being cut.  Still, you cannot tell the difference between Rupp being upset because his time is losing the title game versus Rupp being upset because he is losing to a team of blacks.  Even if you see that as being insult added to injury, you have to admit losing is a pretty bad injury.  But the way the story is being told it is impossible not to overlay racism over everything, even when one of the Miners goes out of bounds and ends up in the lap of the Kentucky coach.  I sure got the feeling that I was supposed to think Rupp was offended by being touched by a black player, especially given how the scene is cut.There is a notion of Texas Western being underdogs (remember, they are just a mining school on the Rio Grande), but the team only has one lost when they get to the University of Maryland for the title game.  Actually they were ranked third in the nation, which is hardly underdog territory, but in terms of history Texas Western and Kentucky are clearly leagues apart.  But then Haskins decides he has had enough of all of the crap he is hearing and to not only start five black players, but also to use only his two other black players as reserves.  The real Haskins appears several times in the special features on this DVD saying that he just started his five best players, but that is not how the movie does it.  What bothers me is that one of his non-black players, Jerry Armstrong (Austin Nichols), plays a pivotal role in the game against Kansas, playing defense and shutting down Jo-Jo White.  Now, chances are this was made up, but a coach going for the national title does not want this kid playing defense against Louie Dampier or Pat Riley?  I realize my problem is that I know so much about this team and that game to begin with, but even within the context of the film they are overdoing it here.",4,Retelling the story of the 1966 NCAA

980495,A306NG42JJRH2J,B000EXZFCQ,"Mark Harris ""Darth Falkon""","[1, 2]","""Cinematic liberties"" aside, this was an excellent retelling of the hugely important Texas Western (UTEP) championship season of 1966 that shattered the color barrier in collegiate sports.  Though it does exaggerate and embellish a tad, the movie stays true to the theme, which was the end to segregation in college basketball.  The four star rating, rather than a perfect five, was for the DVD release itself.  Allow me to elaborate...I was eagerly anticipating this DVD, hoping that Disney would take advantage of all the great extra material they could have included on this release.  I was very disappointed.  For example, there were only four deleted scenes, when there was so much more footage that could have been salvaged (I was very fortunate to have been an extra in the movie, and saw lots of unused scenes shot that I think would have added to the film).  I also feel that, while there is a short segment of interviews with the players and coaches of the time on the disc, it barely scratches the surface of these amazing individuals, and more in-depth biographies of and insights from them could have been included.  On a side note, the Alicia Keys ""music video"" on the disc is nothing more than a two minute clip discussing the inspiration for the song, and it cuts off right in the middle of the song itself (??).  And finally, I could not figure out why the excellent movie trailer, which is usually a staple on a DVD today, was not on the disc.Another travesty was the omission of the scenes featuring Herman Carr, an African-American boyhood friend of Don Haskins' who was mostly responsible (according to Haskins himself) for Haskins' racial color-blindness.  Playing basketball against Carr helped make Haskins the type of player, coach, and unbiased individual he was, and Haskins has said in interviews that those scenes definitely should have been left in the final cut.  (Yet nary a deleted scene was included...)And the most obvious omission had to be the lack of any footage at all of the actual 1966 championship game.  I know that if they had tried, the movie execs could have obtained a copy of the game (heck, I own VHS copy myself) and given it a digital makeover so today's generation could see it for themselves.  After all, I'm fairly certain that anyone who watches this movie would have a great interest in seeing THE ACTUAL GAME that changed basketball forever.I really love the movie, but it is my sincere hope that ""Glory Road"" receives the same treatment as previous Bruckheimer films and gets re-released as a multi-disc Special Edition that includes some of the features that this one was lacking.  Maybe if enough people write Disney, they'll get the message.Other than that, it's a wonderful movie.  See it if you haven't!!ADDED 9/24/08: In case you have not heard, our beloved Don ""The Bear"" Haskins passed away last Sunday, September 7 of heart failure at age 78.  Here's hoping they re-release a deluxe version with a special tribute to one of the greatest coaches- and human beings- the world has ever known.  Rest in peace, Coach.

980497,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000EXZFCQ,Mel Odom,"[1, 2]","In 1965, girls high school coach Don Haskins was given the head coaching position at Texas Western University.  Originally, he was merely hired to handle the men's dorms.  Football was the only game in town that anyone cared about.  But Haskins saw the job as an opportunity for him to coach an NCAA team, and for him to bring players into the community.  Given no prospects and precious little in the way of scholarships, Haskins went on the road looking for players that would play for him.  He recruited seven black players from all around the United States, going into the ghettoes, going into their mothers' houses to get them.  And he got them.  He brought back young men who were destined to become legends:  Bobby Joe Hill, David Lattin, Harry Flournoy, Orsten Artis, Willie Cager, Willie Worseley, and Nevil Shed.  They joined five Texas Western players (Jerry Armstrong, David Palacio, Togo Railey, Dick Meyers and Louis Baudoin) to make up the team.  That season, the Texas Miners turned basketball into something the community was proud up, and they shattered the racial barrier that had existed to hold out black basketball players.Jerry Bruckheimer touches gold with nearly everything he does.  His heart has to be attuned to these kinds of stories.  REMEMBER THE TITANS won over a viewing audience and provided an uplifting experience.  Josh Lucas, starring as Coach Don Haskins, is going to have a brilliant career ahead of him.GLORY ROAD is a feel-good moving that's also an eye-opener for anyone who didn't live through the turbulent time of the 1960s.  (On a personal note, which I don't like to do in these reviews, my eight-year-old son watched the movie with me and couldn't believe that black people could be treated so badly.  Nor could he understand why someone else would want to treat anyone else that way because of the color of their skin.  My son has never seen prejudice like that.)  The film is highly watchable, moves along at a rapid clip for the most part, and touches on all the hotspots Haskins and his team had to endure.The only stumble the film makes is simply not its fault.  The story is just too big to be told in two hours.  The end result is a sleek vehicle that cruises through the big parts of the story, but sacrifices a lot of what the players, coach and his family went through at the time.  It compares favorably to HOOSIERS starring Gene Hackman, also based on a true story, but HOOSIERS has more heart in some ways.  Still, while HOOSIERS may hold the number one spot, number two is a great position to be in.  And this is it.GLORY ROAD is another star in Bruckheimer's sky.  Anyone who wants a feel good movie, one that has solid basketball action in it and a chance to look at history in the re-making, will love this film.

Johnson, only one year before, had signed into the law the Civil Rights Act; President Johnson sent more American troops to South Vietnam; the Soviet space craft Venera 3 became the first man-made object to land on another planet; and in March of that year, a monumental event occurred within U.S. collegiate sports thanks to the abilities of the basketball coach Don Haskins.  The late 1960's were a tumultuous period in U.S. history due the number of changes that were occurring in society.  Most notably, the Civil Rights movement as lead by Martin Luther King, Jr., which lead the U.S. Congress and President Johnson passing the Civil Rights Act and end segregation.  Up until that time, southern colleges and universities were highly segregated, especially their sports teams.  So, when the little known university named ""Texas Western College"" in El Paso, Texas hired a new basketball coach to help their ailing team (the Miners), they didn't know what they were getting themselves into as the man they hired, Don Haskins, was more interested in an individual's athletic abilities than the color of his/her skin.  As shown in the 2006 film ""Glory Road"", after Don Haskins (played by Josh Lucas) began to recruit African-American basketball players for the university's basketball team, not everyone was happy; but as the team began to repeatedly win against teams from other universities that were mostly (if not completely) Caucasian, both the university and the residents of El Paso cheered for their mostly African-American team.  The team's success under Don Haskins allowed the Texas Western College Miner basketball team to then be included in the prestigious NCAA Basketball Tournament, where it's abilities took them all the way to the final game with the predominantly Caucasian team from the University of Kentucky Wildcats, whose head coach was the legendary Adolph Rupp (played by Jon Voight).With a brilliantly written screenplay (thanks to the writers Chris Cleveland and Bettina Gilois), great direction (thanks to director James Gartner and superb acting, ""Glory Road"" is a truly wonderful film and a fitting tribute to the real coach Don Haskins.  Other notable characters in the film include the 1966 Texas Western College College basketball players, which included Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke), Willie 'Scoops' Cager (Damaine Radcliff), Willie Worsley (Sam Jones III), David Lattin (Schin A.S. Kerr), Jerry Armstrong (Austin Nichols), Orsten Artis (Alphonso McAuley), Nevil Shed (Al Shearer), Harry Flournoy (Mehcad Brooks) and David Palacio (Alejandro D. Hernandez).  Other notable characters in the film include Don Haskin's wife Mary Haskins (Emily Deschanel), Harry Flournoy's mother (Elizabeth Omilami) and Jerry Armstrong's father (Graham Timbes).  Though the film received no Oscar nominations, it did win the ""Best Sports Movie"" from the ESPY Awards (Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Awards).  My overall rating for the film is 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  Today, at the University of Texas at El Paso (the former Texas Western College), the main basketball sports arena is named the ""Don Haskins Center"" and can seat 12,000.  Thanks to the real Don Haskins, the doors to collegiate sports were opened to everyone regardless of the color of one's skin.",5,A Fitting Tribute to Legendary NCAA Basketball Coach Don Haskins,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,3349,"['year', 'was', '1966', 'Then', 'President', 'Lyndon', 'B.', 'Johnson', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'had', 'signed', 'law', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Act', 'President', 'Johnson', 'sent', 'more', 'American', 'troops', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'Soviet', 'space', 'craft', 'Venera', '3', 'became', 'first', 'man-made', 'object', 'land', 'planet', 'March', 'year', 'monumental', 'event', 'occurred', 'U.S.', 'collegiate', 'sports', 'thanks', 'abilities', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'late', '1960', 'were', 'tumultuous', 'period', 'U.S.', 'history', 'due', 'number', 'changes', 'were', 'occurring', 'society', 'Most', 'notably', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'lead', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'lead', 'U.S.', 'Congress', 'President', 'Johnson', 'passing', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Act', 'end', 'segregation', 'time', 'southern', 'colleges', 'universities', 'were', 'highly', 'segregated', 'especially', 'sports', 'teams', 'So', 'when', 'little', 'known', 'university', 'named', 'Texas', 'Western', 'College', 'El', 'Paso', 'Texas', 'hired', 'new', 'basketball', 'coach', 'help', 'ailing', 'team', 'Miners', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'man', 'hired', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'individual', 'athletic', 'abilities', 'color', 'his/her', 'skin', 'shown', '2006', 'film', 'Glory', 'Road', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'played', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'began', 'recruit', 'African-American', 'basketball', 'players', 'university', 'basketball', 'team', 'not', 'everyone', 'was', 'happy', 'team', 'began', 'repeatedly', 'win', 'teams', 'other', 'universities', 'were', 'mostly', 'not', 'completely', 'Caucasian', 'university', 'residents', 'El', 'Paso', 'cheered', 'mostly', 'African-American', 'team', 'team', 'success', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'allowed', 'Texas', 'Western', 'College', 'Miner', 'basketball', 'team', 'then', 'be', 'included', 'prestigious', 'NCAA', 'Basketball', 'Tournament', 'where', 'abilities', 'took', 'way', 'final', 'game', 'predominantly', 'Caucasian', 'team', 'University', 'Kentucky', 'Wildcats', 'head', 'coach', 'was', 'legendary', 'Adolph', 'Rupp', 'played', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'screenplay', 'thanks', 'writers', 'Chris', 'Cleveland', 'Bettina', 'Gilois', 'great', 'direction', 'thanks', 'director', 'James', 'Gartner', 'superb', 'acting', 'Glory', 'Road', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'film', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'real', 'coach', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'Other', 'notable', 'characters', 'film', 'include', '1966', 'Texas', 'Western', 'College', 'College', 'basketball', 'players', 'included', 'Bobby', 'Joe', 'Hill', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Willie', ""'Scoops"", 'Cager', 'Damaine', 'Radcliff', 'Willie', 'Worsley', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'III', 'David', 'Lattin', 'Schin', 'A.S.', 'Kerr', 'Jerry', 'Armstrong', 'Austin', 'Nichols', 'Orsten', 'Artis', 'Alphonso', 'McAuley', 'Nevil', 'Shed', 'Al', 'Shearer', 'Harry', 'Flournoy', 'Mehcad', 'Brooks', 'David', 'Palacio', 'Alejandro', 'D.', 'Hernandez', 'Other', 'notable', 'characters', 'film', 'include', 'Don', 'Haskin', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Haskins', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'Harry', 'Flournoy', 'mother', 'Elizabeth', 'Omilami', 'Jerry', 'Armstrong', 'father', 'Graham', 'Timbes', 'film', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'did', 'win', 'Best', 'Sports', 'Movie', 'ESPY', 'Awards', 'Excellence', 'Sports', 'Performance', 'Yearly', 'Awards', 'overall', 'rating', 'film', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Today', 'University', 'Texas', 'El', 'Paso', 'former', 'Texas', 'Western', 'College', 'main', 'basketball', 'sports', 'arena', 'named', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'Center', 'can', 'seat', '12,000', 'Thanks', 'real', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'doors', 'collegiate', 'sports', 'were', 'opened', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'color', 'one', 'skin']",N/A

Coach Don Haskins had the audacity at this time (the early 1960s) to play an all African/American lineup against whitebread champion Kentucky.  The movie chronicles the prejudice the boys encountered and how the coach and the team itself overcame this and went on for the biggest upset in sporting history.Josh Lucas gives one of his most impressive performances as the hardnosed but compassionate Haskins, and in a brief role, a hardly recognizable Jon Voight plays the legendary coach Adolph Rupp.  The players, headlined by Derek Luke, all do marvelous jobs and Emily Deschanel glows in the underwritten role of Haskins' wife, but this IS a movie about the game and not so much Haskins' homelife.  The basketball sequences are shot with intensity and energy and you feel yourself rooting for the boys even though you know the outcome.Not the greatest of sports movies, but an uplifting and entertaining one.",5,THIS SPORTING LIFE,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,1126,"['GLORY', 'ROAD', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'cinematic', 'depictions', 'true', 'life', 'heroic', 'sports', 'events', 'national', 'championship', 'underdog', 'Texas', 'Western', 'team', 'certainly', 'milestone', 'sports', 'history', 'Coach', 'Don', 'Haskins', 'had', 'audacity', 'time', 'early', '1960s', 'play', 'African/American', 'lineup', 'whitebread', 'champion', 'Kentucky', 'movie', 'prejudice', 'boys', 'encountered', 'how', 'coach', 'team', 'overcame', 'went', 'biggest', 'upset', 'sporting', 'history.Josh', 'Lucas', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'performances', 'hardnosed', 'compassionate', 'Haskins', 'brief', 'role', 'hardly', 'recognizable', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'legendary', 'coach', 'Adolph', 'Rupp', 'players', 'headlined', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'do', 'marvelous', 'jobs', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'underwritten', 'role', 'Haskins', 'wife', 'movie', 'game', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Haskins', 'homelife', 'basketball', 'sequences', 'are', 'shot', 'intensity', 'energy', 'feel', 'rooting', 'boys', 'even', 'know', 'outcome.Not', 'greatest', 'sports', 'movies', 'uplifting', 'entertaining', 'one']",N/A
980500,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000EXZFCQ,mirasreviews,"[3, 3]","""Glory Road"" is the story of what some have called the most important game in basketball history: The 1966 NCAA Championship game between the Texas Western Miners, coached by Don Haskins, and the Kentucky Wildcats, coached by veteran Adolph Rupp. The game's significance was that all of the Miners who played in that game were black. Never before had so many black players been seen on an NCAA court at one time. And they won. This created a lot of opportunity for black college athletes, particularly in the South, and changed the way people play basketball.  ""Glory Road"" focuses on coach Don Haskins' (Josh Lucas) efforts to build a great team at  Western Texas College (now UTEP) and the struggles of the black athletes to win respect while they were constantly gibed and occasionally threatened. Eager for the opportunity to coach a Division One team after succeeding with girls' high school basketball, Coach Haskins moves his family into the Texas Western men's dorm and sets about recruiting some good players -only to find that his budget was insufficient to lure any coveted athletes. But other schools are not courting black players. So Haskins scours the nation, from junior colleges to urban streets, to find great players. He ends up with a team of 7 black and 5 white athletes in whom to instill his ideas about ""fundamental, disciplined, defensive basketball.""""Glory Road"" is shot is a naturalistic, unrefined style bordering on cinema verite and conveys a strong sense of the mid-1960s culture in which the events take place. Natural, directional light, which tends to be high-contrast, and a muted color palette combine to make a distinctive visual style. It's a wonder that the style is as consistent as it is, since cinematographer John Toon shot half the movie before having to quit due to illness and was replaced by Jeffrey Kimball. Both of these cinematographers deliver a consistent and appropriate visual style for first-time director James Gartner. The film focuses on Coach Haskins and the Miners team that won the 1966 Championship. The legendary Don Haskins was more of a disciplinarian and also more of a rogue than we see in the film. He hustled pool to fund those recruiting trips. Josh Lucas brings an intensity, energy, and amiability to the role. Although we know something of the players' backgrounds, the focus is greater on the black players than the white, and even then it is cursory. The film is more about the obstacles that black players faced than about the players themselves. There are several nice supporting performances, but John Voight's turn as Coach Rupp is particularly memorable.The DVD (Disney 2006): Bonus features include 4 deleted scenes (7 min), 3 featurettes, a music video for ""Sweet Music"" by Alicia Keys (2 min), and 2 audio commentaries. ""Legacy of the Bear"" (13 min) is about Coach Haskins' long career at Texas Western/UTEP (1962-1999) including interviews with Don Haskins and wife Mary, some of his players, biographer Ray Sanchez, et al. ""In Their Own Words: Remembering 1966"" (23 min) is about the 12-man 1965-1966 Miners team. Interviews with Harry Flournoy, David Lattin, Nevil Shed, Willie Worsley, Dick Myers, Togo Railey, Orsten Artis, Louis Baudoin, Don Haskins, and Pat Riley, who was on the opposing Kentucky team in 1966. In ""Surviving Practice"" (4 min), Tim Hardaway talks about coaching the actors. The first audio commentary is by director James Gartner, who discusses what elements of the film are literal and what has been fictionalized, casting, his intentions in various scenes, what was included, what was left out, and why. The second audio commentary is by the writing team of Christopher Cleveland and Bettina Gilois, who provide additional information about Don Haskins, discuss input they got from the players and the purpose behind some of the scenes they wrote.

There have been many social changes over the past forty years and many of them have been detrimental to society as a whole, but watching this movie with my grandsons made me remember that not all of the social changes our country has gone through have been bad. The boys were shocked and kept asking me for conformation that blacks were indeed, treated the way they were in the 1960's.  Though the barrier they broke came almost two decades after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in baseball, that barrier in college basketball remained largely in place. It took the courage of a great coach and a determined bunch of playground athletes to tear it down. GLORY ROAD is their story.Sports fans are likely familiar with the amazing story of the 1966 - 1967 Texas Western Basketball Team, but for many, their story has been forgotten. This magnificent film brings it back with accuracy and the same type of impact they themselves had on college sports. Theirs is accurately categorized as one of the most amazing accomplishments in all of sports.This is a movie not just limited to sports fans, but rather one that your whole family will enjoy. While being a story of courage and overcoming adversity, it is also a reminder of where we once were socially (not all that many years ago) and where we must never return. Yes, I am all too well aware that there remains a great deal of prejudice and bigotry in our world, but this story reminds us that the `good old days' weren't that good for everyone and that progress has been made. This is also a reminder that truth makes far better stories than fiction. If you liked `Remember the Titans"", then you will love this movie and the lessons it has to offer.

""Glory Road"" tells the true story, with much dramatic license along the way, of one of sport's greatest moments. A moment that changed the face and color of college basketball and rippled across all sports. It's the story of a little known college basketball coach, Don Haskins, and how he came to be the coach of little known Texas Western College in El Paso, Texas. It's also the story of the black players who would be recruited from all around the USA to eventually wind up playing in one of the greatest moments in college basketball: David ""Daddy D"" Lattin, Nevil Shed, Willie Cager, Orsten Artis, ""Wee"" Willie Worsley, Harry Flournoy, and of course the late floor general, Bobby Joe Hill. And the other team members played their vital roles also: Jerry Armstrong, Louis Baudoin, Dick Meyers, Togo Railey and David Palacio. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer does a wonderful job of bringing back the singular moment of the all-white Kentucky team under Adolph Rupp (Jon Voigt is a hoot in this role) and Haskin's all-black starting five meeting in the NCAA basketball national championship final game spotlight during some tough racial times for the USA. In fact, Haskins had played this combination of players many times before during the season to little local fanfare, so it was no big deal to him. He just wanted to win. Josh Lucas is great as Don ""The Bear"" Haskins in this excellent James Gartner-directed movie. It's said that Lucas, in preparing for this role, was driven out into the desert by Haskins in his truck and they just sat and talked (and drank) for many hours discussing how Haskins did it and the way he did it. (This has turned into quite a good friendship since then.) The movie pre-screenings, with all of the living original players on hand, in El Paso are greatly appreciated by all of us who lived through those incredible times and are still here.In light of today's social freedoms, the movie does a great job of depicting the tough racial times of the 1960's and the events that put Haskins, the team, and TWC on the athletic map forever. Not to mention the huge pot of money that TWC got from participating in the tournament.  Shortly after these events, the University of Texas education system made TWC a full partner by the redesignation of the ""University of Texas-El Paso"" and a boatload of construction/faculty money flowed from Austin to El Paso.  I was there and it was a grand moment to be remembered. A great must-see movie not just for the sports but also for the social impact of those times. Hats off again to Jerry Bruckheimer for personally carrying the banner on the national-level TV and radio shows promoting this movie.

The movie chronicles the obstacles he and his players faced, as well as their ultimate triumph when the team won the national championship in 1966.""Glory Road"" worships at the altar of just about every underdog-sports-movie clich&eacute; one can imagine, yet the viewer can't help getting caught up in its story anyway.  The scenes in the first half of the movie definitely have a familiar ring to them, as we see the coach first alienating his players with his hardnosed tactics, then winning them over by building comradeship and showing them how much they can accomplish when they work together as a team rather than as individuals.  However, as with ""Remember the Titans,"" ""Glory Road"" is more interested in examining the social background of its time period than in merely telling yet another sports-oriented David and Goliath tale.  The second half of the film concentrates more on the overt racism the team members face and the surprising courage they and their coach demonstrate in confronting it (could this really be set a mere 40 years ago?).  The young actors are uniformly excellent, but it is Josh Lucas as Coach Haskins who delivers the powerhouse performance here.  And director James Gartner manages to keep the film moving at a fast clip, never allowing it to get bogged down in message-mongering or overt preachiness.Almost in spite of itself, ""Glory Road"" turns into a genuinely inspiring story about courage and determination in the face of societal pressure and incalculable odds.

Because it would not want to suggest that the team succeeded under circumstances that suggest less-than-perfect equality, although, quite certainly, that's what happened. Hollywood is either committed to sunny, black-is-soul revisionism (this picture and the similiarly ridiculous ""Remember The Titans"" that had Denzel Washington asking a white kid to call him Daddy upon their first meeting) or the outwardly confrontational films like ""Crash."" All of them imagine people as more verbal and forward than they are.History is, sadly for movies, made by people busy living life imperfectly - with prejudice, uncertainty, sadness, despair. Some of that can be found in Christopher Cleveland and Bettina Gilois' screenplay for ""Glory Road,"" but it is outlined as such, and never attributed to the great coach. And director James Gartner never finds an appropriate artistic expression. Why must ""Varsity Blues,"" of all the frass in the world, have more visual authority than a picture with every Disney dime behind it?And why Josh Lucas as Haskins, a man nicknamed ""the Bear"" for his unrelenting, burly exterior? Lucas comes across as a sneering jerk speaking in the thirty-second bursts the screenplay apportions for him. The coach is a piece of wood, a sports automaton whose asides are delivered in the same flat empty tones, just a shade quieter. Haskins coaches a mostly black team comprised of stereotypes instead of characters: The Scared One, the Misunderstood Beast, the Studious One, the One With the Loud, Fat Momma (ah, those acceptable black stereotypes) and the Talent, Bobby Joe Hill, played by Derek Luke as the one kid who bucks the coach back by dating a woman (in one of the movie's more honest moments, the married and hypocritical Haskins cannot accept his players pursuing similar goals) and pleading with Haskins to ""let us play our game.""Haskins' response: ""Okay, play your game. And you'll play my game."" Huh? It actually looks conspicuously like today's game, minus, mercifully, the three-pointers. It's all flash, dunks, screams and blaring trumpet music. ""Days of Thunder"" was more illuminating about NASCAR.The movie makes a big deal out of Haskins berating the team and questioning its effort, right before it tears through the whole nation and loses one whopping game - clearly the product of a one-year project. Shame Haskins built the team over a half-decade, he was playing four seniors by the NCAA Tournament; As interesting achievement as Texas Western had, it was far from Cinderella, and it didn't exactly equate to Jackie Robinson or Jesse Owens. The team faces its share of racism, yet the film ignores the team's segregation and does not comment on Hill and teammate Willie Cager's frequent use of the term of ""whitey."" And Haskins' fateful decision in the NCAA Tournament Championship against Kentucky comes off more like a gimmick, which it was, than a defining moment. This is, after all, after Bill Russell had won several championships with the Celtics, and Wilt Chamberlain scored 100. This is after the Harlem Globetrotters.But it is before Kentucky basketball coach Adolph Rupp had ever recruited a black player, and without him and his team - it helps that NBA coach Pat Riley was on it - the Texas Western story lacks its impact. Rupp is effectively played by Jon Voight, who veils his racism with look and patronizing statements. Strangely, Rupp is pitiable and sympathetic because ""Glory Road"" seeks to paint him as some old Southern fool - witness Rupp's bewildering, yet oddly inspiring, speech when Kentucky trails late in the game - and instead gives us the most three-dimensional, honest personality in the film. In a movie littered with issues standing in as characters, here's the one guy successful enough to be troubled.""Glory Road"" plays its race card all funny.

980525,A24PVVTV5PQKRM,B000EXZFCQ,Sonia Nat,"[6, 12]","I think most reasonable Americans will say that they are not racist and deplore it. This is different then saying you agree with cultural values that certain races have proposed to adopt for themselves. Glory Road is a fine story, no disagreement, but like all racial movies, it lacks honesty, and fair dealing.  Truth be told, racism is not an issue today for blacks, period. It was then. This story does a fine job of telling it, and making it halfway interesting. But, there is always more to a story than the pro-liberal anti-racist message. It is truly unfortunate, that we can never address the issues of race honestly. How about a movie about Tookie Williams, the evil black man who killed 4 people in cold blood b/c he was a ""street survivor"". Or we need a movie about how oppressed Whitney Houston is during her last 20 years as a coked up millionaire who is constantly getting arrested. Or maybe a movie about 50 cent, a true story about how he murdered people and sold crack to people while ruining their lives. Or how about a movie that questions black culture, instead of a movie that constantly demonizes white culture as racist, from a time most Americans don't remember. I am unclear as to how these reverse racist movies are always getting made. The VAST majority of white people today bend over backwards and sideways to accommodate black people to insure their every unnecessary demand is met, and that every possible advantage is given them at every challenge. Every college provides unheard of scholarships for black kids based on their color, whilst charging white students exuberant amounts. These are stories that need to be made into movies. But that will not happen. We live in a strange era, where honest talk and forthright communication that asks real questions is severely oppressed by the Government and law. The new McCartyism is, without any shadow of doubt, Racism. This movie promotes the big lie, that whites are racist. People actually still believe this when every shred of evidence points to the contrary. Special privileges are conferred upon blacks at every corner, every excuse given for their behavior, while no accountability is administered. Unfortuanate. And movies like this continue to feed that big race lie. Many people after reading this will be angry. My answer is why? I am not racist. I do not hate the black skin color. No, I think very critically about movies and the issues they pose. I have a Dr. who is black, a female law professor who is black (and very, very intelligent)and several black friends, (unfortuantely too, in this day and age you must always qualify yourself, when thinking critically, as a ""non-racist"") I engage in real conversation w/ blacks quite a bit about the problems I see with their assertions. I can tell you, most at first get mad at me, then listen intently, they realize I do not hate. People who call people racist cop out, and are more full of hate and spite then those they chide. No, people respect me b/c I respect them, but I do not sign off on socially acceptable messages, when under the surface they are very hurtful. As is the case w/ Glory Road, a seemingly truthful movie that shows how blacks are human and special. Thats fine, but it falls on its face in sincerity, and the movie itself charges racism a/g whites. Please, if you see this, remember that it is a clear message that should be taken with a grain of salt.",3,Unfair to whites...,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,3419,"['think', 'most', 'reasonable', 'Americans', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'racist', 'deplore', 'different', 'then', 'saying', 'agree', 'cultural', 'values', 'certain', 'races', 'have', 'proposed', 'adopt', 'Glory', 'Road', 'fine', 'story', 'disagreement', 'racial', 'movies', 'honesty', 'fair', 'dealing', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'racism', 'not', 'issue', 'today', 'blacks', 'period', 'was', 'then', 'story', 'fine', 'job', 'telling', 'making', 'halfway', 'interesting', 'always', 'more', 'story', 'pro-liberal', 'anti-racist', 'message', 'truly', 'unfortunate', 'can', 'never', 'address', 'issues', 'race', 'honestly', 'How', 'movie', 'Tookie', 'Williams', 'evil', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'killed', '4', 'people', 'cold', 'blood', 'b/c', 'was', 'street', 'survivor', 'need', 'movie', 'how', 'oppressed', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'last', '20', 'years', 'coked', 'up', 'millionaire', 'who', 'constantly', 'getting', 'arrested', 'maybe', 'movie', '50', 'cent', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'murdered', 'people', 'sold', 'crack', 'people', 'ruining', 'lives', 'how', 'movie', 'questions', 'black', 'culture', 'instead', 'movie', 'constantly', 'white', 'culture', 'racist', 'time', 'most', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'am', 'unclear', 'how', 'reverse', 'racist', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'getting', 'made', 'VAST', 'majority', 'white', 'people', 'today', 'bend', 'backwards', 'sideways', 'accommodate', 'black', 'people', 'insure', 'unnecessary', 'demand', 'met', 'possible', 'advantage', 'given', 'challenge', 'college', 'unheard', 'scholarships', 'black', 'kids', 'based', 'color', 'whilst', 'charging', 'white', 'students', 'exuberant', 'amounts', 'are', 'stories', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'movies', 'will', 'not', 'happen', 'live', 'strange', 'era', 'where', 'honest', 'talk', 'forthright', 'communication', 'real', 'questions', 'severely', 'oppressed', 'Government', 'law', 'new', 'McCartyism', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'Racism', 'movie', 'big', 'lie', 'whites', 'are', 'racist', 'People', 'actually', 'still', 'believe', 'when', 'shred', 'evidence', 'points', 'contrary', 'Special', 'privileges', 'are', 'conferred', 'blacks', 'corner', 'excuse', 'given', 'behavior', 'accountability', 'administered', 'Unfortuanate', 'movies', 'continue', 'feed', 'big', 'race', 'lie', 'Many', 'people', 'reading', 'will', 'be', 'angry', 'answer', 'why', 'am', 'not', 'racist', 'do', 'not', 'hate', 'black', 'skin', 'color', 'No', 'think', 'very', 'critically', 'movies', 'issues', 'pose', 'have', 'Dr.', 'who', 'black', 'female', 'law', 'professor', 'who', 'black', 'very', 'very', 'intelligent', 'several', 'black', 'friends', 'unfortuantely', 'too', 'day', 'age', 'must', 'always', 'qualify', 'when', 'thinking', 'critically', 'non-racist', 'engage', 'real', 'conversation', 'w/', 'blacks', 'quite', 'bit', 'problems', 'see', 'assertions', 'can', 'tell', 'most', 'first', 'get', 'mad', 'then', 'intently', 'realize', 'do', 'not', 'hate', 'People', 'who', 'call', 'people', 'racist', 'cop', 'are', 'more', 'full', 'hate', 'spite', 'then', 'chide', 'No', 'people', 'respect', 'respect', 'do', 'not', 'sign', 'off', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'messages', 'when', 'surface', 'are', 'very', 'hurtful', 'case', 'w/', 'Glory', 'Road', 'seemingly', 'truthful', 'movie', 'how', 'blacks', 'are', 'human', 'special', 'Thats', 'fine', 'face', 'sincerity', 'movie', 'racism', 'a/g', 'whites', 'Please', 'see', 'remember', 'clear', 'message', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt']",N/A
