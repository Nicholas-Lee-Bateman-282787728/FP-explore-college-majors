OK, another stylistic caricature of ""The Mormons"". Like some horrible B&W; movie I saw many years ago with some horror movie star (Can't remember his name. Boris Karloff of someone like him.)Anyway this guy who portrays Joseph Smith is truly believable as God's Prophet. He is truly the kind of man I would love to sit down and share a beer with and even follow to the Rocky Mountains.This movie helps you to understand why a few renegade Mormons would even want to get even with a few travelers from the Missouri area coming through Utah's Mountain Meadows. Not the kind of behavior Christians should take part in but people sometimes do carry a grudge, Christian or not, when loved ones have been persecuted and murdered as a matter of political convenience.This movie is informative and fun for the whole family.Even young people need to know that just like chickens in the chicken yard or children on the school ground, we are many times not much different we we ""grow up"".Watch and enjoy Part one and this movie which is Part Two.Then go out and find Part three.",5,Another Eye Opening view of America's Past,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,1220,"['must', 'first', 'view', 'Work', 'Glory', 'Part', 'One', 'enjoy', 'context', 'movie', 'Part', 'Two.When', 'first', 'heard', 'movies', 'thought', 'OK', 'stylistic', 'caricature', 'Mormons', 'horrible', 'B', 'W', 'movie', 'saw', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'horror', 'movie', 'star', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'someone', 'Anyway', 'guy', 'who', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'truly', 'believable', 'God', 'Prophet', 'truly', 'kind', 'man', 'would', 'love', 'sit', 'down', 'share', 'beer', 'even', 'follow', 'Rocky', 'Mountains.This', 'movie', 'understand', 'why', 'few', 'renegade', 'Mormons', 'would', 'even', 'want', 'get', 'even', 'few', 'travelers', 'Missouri', 'area', 'coming', 'Utah', 'Mountain', 'Meadows', 'Not', 'kind', 'behavior', 'Christians', 'should', 'take', 'part', 'people', 'sometimes', 'do', 'carry', 'grudge', 'Christian', 'not', 'when', 'loved', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'persecuted', 'murdered', 'matter', 'political', 'convenience.This', 'movie', 'informative', 'fun', 'whole', 'family.Even', 'young', 'people', 'need', 'know', 'just', 'chickens', 'chicken', 'yard', 'children', 'school', 'ground', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'grow', 'up', '.Watch', 'enjoy', 'Part', 'one', 'movie', 'Part', 'Two.Then', 'go', 'out', 'find', 'Part', 'three']",N/A

They did change a few things in the movie but overall I felt it followed the books about as closely as you can expect.My problem is not with the movie but with the DVD itself. We spent nearly $22 to buy this movie and we take it home hoping not only to enjoy the movie but a plethora of features as well. When we turned the DVD on you will find that the STINKING CHEAP SKATES who produced the DVD give you only two options on the DVD menu, play movie and setup. How cheap is that? The company that produced the DVD, were too weasly to even put in a chapter selection feature. There were no behind the scene stuff, outtakes or anything.YOU MIGHT AS WELL PURCHASE A VHS VERSION....

I really don't care how closely the movie does or doesn't follow the book, I thorougly enjoyed it.I continue to be impressed with Jonathan Scarfe's portrayal of Joseph Smith.  He is just about exactly as I've always thought Joseph was.  That's just one of the reasons that I really like this movie.I also very much like Andrew Bowen's portrayal of Brigham Young.  I think he captures the essence of Brigham Young's strength of character, his faith, and his loyalty to Joseph Smith.  Very well done.

Hence, do not expect this to be accurate to a fault; just enjoy it for what it is -- enjoyable and entertaining so much so that I await the next installment.P.S.:  It's great to be able to discover a better than mediocre action, drama type movie without excessive violence, offensive sex scenes and language.

979569,A3EJVZ5LCBP61X,B000EWBNNM,"TOMMY C ELLIS ""Prison Rev.""","[17, 18]","Works & Glory II does a splendid job of picking up where the first left off.  The tempo continues at a nice clip, and the acting remains dramatic, authentic, and compelling.The honesty of the dilemma Joseph Smith creates when, after a 1000 mile treck to reclaim Mormon lands that have been confiscated, he makes a rather difficult decision.  His choice causes a ""crisis of faith"" in one of his most loyal disciples, and causes a skeptic to come to Smith's defense.  Clever dialogue here.The most powerful plus for this sequel is that it answers the big ""Why did the Mormons receive so much hostility"" question in a manner that is subtle and realistic.  From the foundation of this movement, there was a tight-knit, look out for one another ethos that garnered both admiration and fear.  Who is this large bloc of people coming into our county?  Are they going to take over?  Will they usurp our power, try to change the way we've run things?  And, of course, will they bloc-vote to prohibit slavery?  Missing from the plot of #2 was any signficant religious opposition.  Most of the hostility and violence came for political and sociological reasons.Bottom-line:  I'm not LDS, so this film served as more of an education for me, then a ""faith-promoting"" movie.  Nevertheless, those interested in this population, will find the movie informative and well done--especially within the religious movie genre.  I'm sure most members of this group will enjoy the movie, and that the leadership will be quietly smiling.",4,"THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS QUITE DECENT, WHATEVER YOUR THEOLOGY",1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,1512,"['Works', 'Glory', 'II', 'splendid', 'job', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'left', 'off', 'tempo', 'nice', 'clip', 'acting', 'dramatic', 'authentic', 'compelling.The', 'honesty', 'dilemma', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'when', '1000', 'mile', 'treck', 'reclaim', 'Mormon', 'have', 'been', 'confiscated', 'rather', 'difficult', 'decision', 'choice', 'crisis', 'faith', 'one', 'most', 'loyal', 'disciples', 'skeptic', 'come', 'Smith', 'defense', 'Clever', 'dialogue', 'here.The', 'most', 'powerful', 'sequel', 'big', 'Why', 'did', 'Mormons', 'receive', 'so', 'much', 'hostility', 'question', 'manner', 'subtle', 'realistic', 'foundation', 'movement', 'was', 'tight-knit', 'look', 'out', 'one', 'ethos', 'garnered', 'admiration', 'fear', 'Who', 'large', 'bloc', 'people', 'coming', 'county', 'Are', 'going', 'take', 'over', 'Will', 'usurp', 'power', 'try', 'change', 'way', ""'ve"", 'run', 'things', 'course', 'will', 'bloc-vote', 'prohibit', 'slavery', 'Missing', 'plot', '2', 'was', 'signficant', 'religious', 'opposition', 'Most', 'hostility', 'violence', 'came', 'political', 'sociological', 'reasons.Bottom-line', ""'m"", 'not', 'LDS', 'film', 'served', 'more', 'education', 'then', 'faith-promoting', 'movie', 'Nevertheless', 'interested', 'population', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'informative', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'religious', 'movie', 'genre', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'members', 'group', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'leadership', 'will', 'be', 'quietly', 'smiling']",N/A
