This is as interesting as anything on B'Way or at the local Rialto. This series has great acting and great material; it has been both professionally produced and artfully directed. The Powell novels have been well adapted to TV, although readers no doubt will miss their favorite parts of the multi-volume novel that has only one peer in modern letters, that by Marcel Proust. This four-part series could just as well have eight, ten or twelve parts. The acting is uniformly satisfying. The film , although highly entertaining, is a marvelous introduction to 20th century British mores. The boys from Eton grow to be men under the Blitz, their friendships and connections carry them along toward triumph and destruction. Widmerpool plays the unloved and unlovable grasper, the most despised sort in English letters, ambition being both a sign of poor breeding and bad taste, while his aristocratic friends muddle along in a world increasingly unwelcome as it is unwelcoming. Powell is the least-known of his generation's literary geniuses, but this long-forgotten masterpiece has finally been given the adaptation it rightly deserves.",5,Television Comes Into Its Own,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,1248,"['case', 'recent', 'HBO', 'series', 'Dance', 'great', 'talents', 'now', 'work', 'TV', 'did', '1950s', 'as', 'interesting', 'anything', ""B'Way"", 'local', 'Rialto', 'series', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'material', 'been', 'professionally', 'produced', 'artfully', 'directed', 'Powell', 'novels', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'adapted', 'TV', 'readers', 'doubt', 'will', 'miss', 'favorite', 'parts', 'multi-volume', 'novel', 'only', 'one', 'peer', 'modern', 'letters', 'Marcel', 'Proust', 'four-part', 'series', 'could', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'eight', 'twelve', 'parts', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'satisfying', 'film', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'marvelous', 'introduction', '20th', 'century', 'British', 'mores', 'boys', 'Eton', 'grow', 'be', 'men', 'Blitz', 'friendships', 'connections', 'carry', 'along', 'triumph', 'destruction', 'Widmerpool', 'unloved', 'unlovable', 'grasper', 'most', 'despised', 'sort', 'English', 'letters', 'ambition', 'being', 'sign', 'poor', 'breeding', 'bad', 'taste', 'aristocratic', 'friends', 'muddle', 'along', 'world', 'increasingly', 'unwelcome', 'unwelcoming', 'Powell', 'least-known', 'generation', 'literary', 'geniuses', 'long-forgotten', 'masterpiece', 'finally', 'been', 'given', 'adaptation', 'rightly']",N/A
747629,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00008V6ZP,Doug Anderson,"[1, 2]","The book may be great but the mini-series can't decide what to do with the hundreds and hundreds of pages of social and cultural history that is Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time. The book is often viewed as a self-portrait of the author and his friends who included literary giants Stephen Spender and John Spencer. But you'd never guess that from this mini-series where everyone seems to have nothing better to do than wile away their time at inconsequential lunches and parties. To mark the passage of time the lunches and parties simply become more and more bohemian until the war breaks out and spoils everyone's plans.Our guide through these several decades is novelist, book reviewer, and sometimes screenwriter Nick Jenkins. In place of a plot the entire series is just the unflappable Nick running into people at random places and catching up on what has come of their lives. Everyone he knows seems disappointed with the world; most are unhappy with both their professional and personal lives. When we first meet Nick in disc one he is in involved with (a mostly naked) Jean Templer but soon into disc two he meets and marries Lady Isobel Tolland. Nothing much is made of the courtship or the marriage. In fact everything in Nick's life is presented matter of factly so its hard for viewers to muster much enthusiasm as well. One of the many recurring characters is Kenneth Widemerpool who is amusing because so socially inept in civilian life and yet so ruthlessly ambitious during the war years. Widmerpool was never popular when in school, his more aristocratic friends treated him as a social inferior, and so when encountering former schoolmates he takes great pleasure in foregrounding his waxing and their waning social status. Jenkins closely tracks Widmerpool's suprising rise through the ranks, as well as the rise of Labor politics in general, and sees it as proof of a decline in the overall quality of English public life. Another recurring figure is Marxist critic CG Quiggins. When we first meet Quiggins he works as secretary for St. John Clarke (played by Sir John Gielgud) but we never learn much about the literary culture of the time which is a real shame because that is what most interested me about this novel. In place of that we get a rather generic look at the forty year span between the late 1920's to the late 1960's and the rather predictable ways the characters are altered by shifting social and political realities, and, perhaps most significantly, by time itself. Nick's closest friends Charles Stringham and Peter Templer both meet tragic ends during the war but Nick manages to survive and live on until the 1960's when the world undergoes yet another monumental cultural shift. The most interesting female character, the femme fatale Pamela Flitton (Miranda Richardson), doesn't appear until the end of disc three and could be read to represent a failed idealism and a rising nihilism in the culture at large.Powell is often compared to Proust as both novelists attempt to conjure lost time and make sense of it. But there is nothing Proustian about this mini-series; the past is offered merely as spectacle, no real meaning is made of it, and we certainly do not feel the shaping hand of a great artist at work as we move from disc one to four.I give this three stars because it is attractive enough to the eye, but the characters and contexts are each only half-imagined. There is no evocative magic at work, no memorable characters or moments, no spell is cast. This is only a vain and plodding attempt to recreate Bridesheadian glory.",3,A Clutter of Characters and Contexts,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,3597,"['book', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'mini-series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'hundreds', 'hundreds', 'pages', 'social', 'cultural', 'history', 'Anthony', 'Powell', 'A', 'Dance', 'Music', 'Time', 'book', 'often', 'viewed', 'self-portrait', 'author', 'friends', 'who', 'included', 'literary', 'giants', 'Stephen', 'Spender', 'John', 'Spencer', ""'d"", 'never', 'guess', 'mini-series', 'where', 'everyone', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'wile', 'away', 'time', 'inconsequential', 'lunches', 'parties', 'mark', 'passage', 'time', 'lunches', 'parties', 'simply', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'bohemian', 'war', 'out', 'spoils', 'everyone', 'plans.Our', 'guide', 'several', 'decades', 'novelist', 'book', 'reviewer', 'sometimes', 'screenwriter', 'Nick', 'Jenkins', 'place', 'plot', 'entire', 'series', 'just', 'unflappable', 'Nick', 'running', 'people', 'random', 'places', 'catching', 'up', 'come', 'lives', 'Everyone', 'disappointed', 'world', 'most', 'are', 'unhappy', 'professional', 'personal', 'lives', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Nick', 'disc', 'one', 'involved', 'mostly', 'naked', 'Jean', 'Templer', 'soon', 'disc', 'two', 'marries', 'Lady', 'Isobel', 'Tolland', 'Nothing', 'much', 'made', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'fact', 'everything', 'Nick', 'life', 'presented', 'matter', 'factly', 'hard', 'viewers', 'muster', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'many', 'recurring', 'characters', 'Kenneth', 'Widemerpool', 'who', 'amusing', 'so', 'socially', 'inept', 'civilian', 'life', 'yet', 'so', 'ruthlessly', 'ambitious', 'war', 'years', 'Widmerpool', 'was', 'never', 'popular', 'when', 'school', 'more', 'aristocratic', 'friends', 'treated', 'social', 'inferior', 'so', 'when', 'encountering', 'former', 'schoolmates', 'great', 'pleasure', 'foregrounding', 'waxing', 'waning', 'social', 'status', 'Jenkins', 'closely', 'Widmerpool', 'suprising', 'rise', 'ranks', 'as', 'well', 'rise', 'Labor', 'politics', 'general', 'proof', 'decline', 'overall', 'quality', 'English', 'public', 'life', 'recurring', 'figure', 'Marxist', 'critic', 'CG', 'Quiggins', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Quiggins', 'secretary', 'St.', 'John', 'Clarke', 'played', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'never', 'learn', 'much', 'literary', 'culture', 'time', 'real', 'shame', 'what', 'most', 'interested', 'novel', 'place', 'get', 'rather', 'generic', 'look', 'forty', 'year', 'span', 'late', '1920', 'late', '1960', 'rather', 'predictable', 'ways', 'characters', 'are', 'altered', 'shifting', 'social', 'political', 'realities', 'perhaps', 'most', 'significantly', 'time', 'Nick', 'closest', 'friends', 'Charles', 'Stringham', 'Peter', 'Templer', 'meet', 'tragic', 'ends', 'war', 'Nick', 'survive', 'live', '1960', 'when', 'world', 'yet', 'monumental', 'cultural', 'shift', 'most', 'interesting', 'female', 'character', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Pamela', 'Flitton', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', ""n't"", 'appear', 'end', 'disc', 'three', 'could', 'be', 'read', 'represent', 'failed', 'idealism', 'rising', 'nihilism', 'culture', 'large.Powell', 'often', 'compared', 'Proust', 'novelists', 'attempt', 'conjure', 'lost', 'time', 'make', 'sense', 'nothing', 'Proustian', 'mini-series', 'past', 'offered', 'merely', 'spectacle', 'real', 'meaning', 'made', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'shaping', 'hand', 'great', 'artist', 'work', 'move', 'disc', 'one', 'four.I', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'attractive', 'enough', 'eye', 'characters', 'contexts', 'are', 'only', 'half-imagined', 'evocative', 'magic', 'work', 'memorable', 'characters', 'moments', 'spell', 'cast', 'only', 'vain', 'plodding', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'Bridesheadian', 'glory']",N/A
747630,A9MAUO67ABVOB,B00008V6ZP,"F. Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[16, 18]","In 1997, British televiewers watched a 4-part miniseries titled ""A Dance to the Music of Time,"" based on 12 novels by Anthony Powell. This 415-minute series is now available in a boxed set of 4 DVDs from Acorn Media.It follows the career of Nicolas Jenkins (played by James D'Arcy in the first three episodes) from his college days in the period between world wars to the 1960s. The strange title represents the dance-like meetings and re-meetings of the central characters as the political, artistic and social life in England undergoes radical changes. (The cast of characters is huge and it is very hard to keep track of them.)I did not like the first episode for the most part, since I found nearly all of the characters uninteresting and not very likable. The one exception was the overweight, pathetic Widmerpool (Simon Russell Beale), who can't keep up physically or socially with the others--but he is the one who rises to positions of power while the others drink, marry the wrong people, or try to do the right thing while the rest couldn't care less.Things improved for me by the second segment. Along the way, what there is of a coherent story  is enlivened by memorably outrageous characters like Pamela Flitton (Miranda Richardson, of ""Black Adder"" fame), who manages to be all of the Marx Brothers at once in putting her betters in their place. Richardson's performance alone is worth the price of the set.I cannot find out why the main character and his wife are played by different actors in the last segment, since all the other members of the cast are aged to show the passing of time. John Standing is a fine actor, but the changeover is disconcerting.There are cast biographies as a modest bonus feature.",4,Hard to follow but well worth it by the end,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,1725,"['1997', 'British', 'televiewers', 'watched', '4-part', 'miniseries', 'titled', 'Dance', 'Music', 'Time', 'based', '12', 'novels', 'Anthony', 'Powell', '415-minute', 'series', 'now', 'available', 'boxed', 'set', '4', 'DVDs', 'Acorn', 'Media.It', 'career', 'Nicolas', 'Jenkins', 'played', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'college', 'days', 'period', 'world', 'wars', '1960s', 'strange', 'title', 'dance-like', 'meetings', 're-meetings', 'central', 'characters', 'political', 'artistic', 'social', 'life', 'England', 'undergoes', 'radical', 'changes', 'cast', 'characters', 'huge', 'very', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'did', 'not', 'first', 'episode', 'most', 'part', 'found', 'nearly', 'characters', 'uninteresting', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'one', 'exception', 'was', 'overweight', 'pathetic', 'Widmerpool', 'Simon', 'Russell', 'Beale', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'physically', 'socially', 'others', 'one', 'who', 'positions', 'power', 'others', 'drink', 'marry', 'wrong', 'people', 'try', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'rest', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less.Things', 'improved', 'second', 'segment', 'way', 'what', 'coherent', 'story', 'enlivened', 'memorably', 'outrageous', 'characters', 'Pamela', 'Flitton', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Black', 'Adder', 'fame', 'who', 'be', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'once', 'putting', 'betters', 'place', 'Richardson', 'performance', 'alone', 'price', 'set.I', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'main', 'character', 'wife', 'are', 'played', 'different', 'actors', 'last', 'segment', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'are', 'aged', 'show', 'passing', 'time', 'John', 'Standing', 'fine', 'actor', 'changeover', 'are', 'cast', 'biographies', 'modest', 'bonus', 'feature']",N/A
747631,A33QZFFLGAD2UJ,B00008V6ZP,"James A. Gorton ""crescentan""","[2, 2]","This is a fine though flawed attempt to capture the substance of the 12-novel series by Anthony Powell, A Dance to the Music of Time.  The series follows its narrator, Nick Jenkins through a large portion of the 20th century, from the '20's through the late '60's, and in so doing, paints a picture of Britain during those years which is absorbing and interesting.The novels comprising A Dance to the Music of Time are a fascinating portrait of an era and included on lists of the 100 best novels of the 20th century.  Hundreds of characters flow through the novels and the interwoven lives of the main characters as the years pass reveal ironies in their earlier relations which are by turns, fascinating, sad or hilarious.  Following characters as they mature and change is one of the chief rewards of the series.  The novels are an intensely satisfying reading experience and reward re-reading.To attempt to condense the more than 1,000 pages of the novels into six or seven hours of the series without losing a good deal of the depth and nuance of the novels is probably hopeless.  The best to be hoped is that a flavor of the works is preserved along with some of the main narrative threads, which is what the series achieves.  The tv series also realized most of the major characters of the books well.Several reviewers have complained of the final third of the series, but some of the richest and darkest humor of the series is to be found in the final three novels.  The Pamela Widmerpool character, in particular, is not to be missed.  The change of actor playing Nick Jenkins, the narrator, is somewhat disappointing, but was apparently done to age the character more realistically.I don't know if this series is particularly intelligible to someone watching without having read the novels.  My sense is that it might be somewhat confusing.  There are several sites which give condensed reviews of the books, however, which would probably be helpful if you got lost.Ultimately, a Dance to the Music of Time should not be missed.

747632,A17JVI15BRY90P,B00008V6ZP,James T. Wheeler,"[1, 2]","This dvd set was a major disappointment, not for the audio or video qualities but for the content and storyline.  Anyone who wonders why we Americans tried to stay away from Europe after the end of World War I might see why that happened.  The society that the British had in the 1920&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s was corrupt and decadent.  The ruling class had no concern about those beneath them in social status.  The rulers simply lived lives of excess and moral degradation that made them deserve what happened later on with World War II.  Not much changed after all this as the minseries seems to have ended in the 1960&#8217;s.  That fact was not made clear and we didn&#8217;t really care anyway.A similar theme was also shown in &#8220;Brideshead Revisited&#8221; but there an over-arching distortion to human behavior caused by the Catholic religion was mainly to blame.  In &#8220;Dance to the Music of Time&#8221; no such excuse could be offered.  The people shown in this story were not engaging or sympathetic in any way.  Only the central character, Nick Jenkins, and his wife Isobel were worth caring about at all.  The others, when they died or came on hard times, were easily ignored.  Why care about self-centered, self-indulgent characters who believe in nothing, do nothing, and are nothing.Considering the all-star cast and lavish production values, &#8220;Dance to the Music of Time&#8221; should have been worth the seven hours time that it took to view.  But it was not.  The ending was especially insipid and meaningless.  Were most of the characters on drugs or drunk most of the time?  Was that the real message&#8212;avoid smoking, drinking, extramarital affairs, and using illicit drugs?  If not, at least this mini-series proves that the British are capable of producing poor stories and inconsequential dramas.  Not everything they do is up to the caliber of &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221; or &#8220;Foyle&#8217;s War.&#8221;  Advice to other potential viewers: save your time and your money.

747633,A106016KSI0YQ,B00008V6ZP,Jay Dickson,"[19, 22]","Adapting all twelve volumes of Anthony Powell's Proustian roman fleuve must have been no easy task, but this 1997 multi-part adaptation by Hugh Whitmore just doesn't come off, despite its excellent cast and production values. There's none of the intellectual soliloquoys of the narrator, Nick Jenkins, that made the books hang together, and the incidents here seem drab and disconnected; it becomes almost impossible to see why certain incidents stand out for the characters more than others, and there's no sense of narrative drive at all. The story encompasses three different milieux that seem widely disconnected--the world of Mayfair parties of the 20s and 30s; the military doings of the war years; and the vaguely leftist literary sphere of the 50s and early 60s--and none of them seem to have much to do with one another. Characters keep drifting back in to the life of Jenkins at the oddest places to remark on the coincidence of their meeting and to de-brief him about their and the other characters' doings, which seems more and more forced as the series runs on.This is one of those casts where almost everyone working in theatre in the British Isles seems to make an appearance, from Eileen Atkins to John Gielgud to Zoe Wanamaker. Four different actors play Nicholas Jenkins, adding much to the overall sense of confusion (especially since they look nothing like one another): the actor who plays him the longest, James Purefoy, is superb at conveying Nick's likability and his blandness. (It's hard to believe Purefoy, who has exhibited such virile charisma as Rawdon Crawley and Mark Anthony elsewhere, can seem so neutered here.) Simon Russell Beale has received much just praise for his performance as the series' most memorable character and anti-hero, the oily Kenneth Widmerpool.

747636,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00008V6ZP,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[6, 6]","It is a picture of beautiful Miranda Richardson that got me to watch this series.  Although I like British classics, these series have started on the high note, but ended with disappointment.  I expected a main character of Nicholas Jenkins, our narrator, a sensitive, cultured man in tune with lives of the upper class Londoners, who strikes his lifelong friendships with main protaginists of this story during his college days in Oxford.  It is thru these friendships that we get to know the lives of the British rich and their struggles to maintain money, positions of power and not to mention marriages in the high society England.  It seems as if these carefully arranged social contracts all seem to dissolve quickly and inexplicably where women are leaving their rich spouses and none of them (except for Jean Temple, Jenkins' first love and a sister of his close friend) manages to marry up; they all seem to marry down, or come back to their hapless, abusive and supresive husbands in order to remain rich, kept women.  It seems that theme for the plot is defined thru famous paintings.  One of them being ""A Dance of the Music of Time"" that describes four circles of human life: poverty, labor, riches and downfall.  All of our protagonists go thru all four of them. Particular exception of beautiful and unhappy Pamela Flinton whose tragic life is marked by her attachment to the painting by Madigliani (which we never see, but we know it exists - and owner(s) of the painting - Pamela and her uncle - seem to have unfortunes follow them as they did the famous painter).  The last part of the series is particularly disappointing as we are watching characted 10 years after the WWII.  They are all worn out and look 20-30 years older than expected.  Main character Jenkins is replaced with a different actor who suddenly seems more of a bore and weakling that a sensitive young man we saw in the first four parts.  There are many paralels between these series and ""Brideshead Revisited"".  In spite of wonderful British actors in these series, I would say that if you are going to spend hours watching generations thru WWI and WWII era in England, you will enjoy more ""Brideshead Revisited"" than ""A Dance to the Music of Time"".",3,Circle of life,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,2237,"['picture', 'beautiful', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'got', 'watch', 'series', 'like', 'British', 'classics', 'series', 'have', 'started', 'high', 'note', 'ended', 'disappointment', 'expected', 'main', 'character', 'Nicholas', 'Jenkins', 'narrator', 'sensitive', 'cultured', 'man', 'tune', 'lives', 'upper', 'class', 'Londoners', 'who', 'lifelong', 'friendships', 'main', 'protaginists', 'story', 'college', 'days', 'Oxford', 'thru', 'friendships', 'get', 'know', 'lives', 'British', 'rich', 'struggles', 'maintain', 'money', 'positions', 'power', 'not', 'mention', 'marriages', 'high', 'society', 'England', 'carefully', 'arranged', 'social', 'contracts', 'seem', 'dissolve', 'quickly', 'inexplicably', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'leaving', 'rich', 'spouses', 'none', 'Jean', 'Temple', 'Jenkins', 'first', 'love', 'sister', 'close', 'friend', 'marry', 'up', 'seem', 'marry', 'down', 'come', 'back', 'hapless', 'abusive', 'supresive', 'husbands', 'order', 'remain', 'rich', 'kept', 'women', 'theme', 'plot', 'defined', 'thru', 'famous', 'paintings', 'One', 'being', 'Dance', 'Music', 'Time', 'four', 'circles', 'human', 'life', 'poverty', 'labor', 'riches', 'downfall', 'protagonists', 'go', 'four', 'Particular', 'exception', 'beautiful', 'unhappy', 'Pamela', 'Flinton', 'tragic', 'life', 'marked', 'attachment', 'painting', 'Madigliani', 'never', 'see', 'know', 'owner', 's', 'painting', 'Pamela', 'uncle', 'seem', 'have', 'unfortunes', 'follow', 'did', 'famous', 'painter', 'last', 'part', 'series', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'are', 'watching', 'characted', '10', 'years', 'WWII', 'are', 'worn', 'out', 'look', '20-30', 'years', 'older', 'expected', 'Main', 'character', 'Jenkins', 'replaced', 'different', 'actor', 'who', 'suddenly', 'more', 'bore', 'weakling', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'saw', 'first', 'four', 'parts', 'are', 'many', 'paralels', 'series', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'spite', 'wonderful', 'British', 'actors', 'series', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'going', 'spend', 'hours', 'watching', 'generations', 'thru', 'WWI', 'WWII', 'era', 'England', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'Dance', 'Music', 'Time']",N/A
747637,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00008V6ZP,Stephanie De Pue,"[12, 13]","""A Dance to the Music of Time,"" (1997) is a four-part British Broadcasting Company television serial based on 20th century English author Anthony Powell's  12-volume literary series of the same name: (the initial volumes have since been combined into four `movements,' as the publisher calls them.)  The author always denied that ""A Dance"" was a roman a clef; still, even to me, many characters resemble figures well-known at the time, and more knowledgeable readers would probably recognize even more.  Also, the narrator, Nick Jenkins's life, closely parallels the writer's.Powell's written series must be considered one of the masterpieces of 20th century British fiction: it is little-known today, and doesn't get the respect it deserves, perhaps because, in addition to being closely observed and intricately plotted, it can be hilarious.  Book and tv series more or less parallel Evelyn Waugh's ""Brideshead Revisited,"" book and BBC-tv series, in their drawing room wit, the social class and lifestyles of their characters, and the between-the wars period of time in which they're largely based, but ""Brideshead,"" of course, particularly the tv serial, is much better-known and admired; it's probably more enjoyable.  The filmic ""Dance"" carries the burden of those 12 books, published over 20 years real time, more than 3,000 pages in total, at least 400 characters, in its relatively brief running time.  Each book gets only around 40 minutes. Script was written by Hugh Whitemore, an able playwright and screenwriter, but if you don't already know the books, you will probably have trouble following it. It's got its advantages, however.  Among other things, the Beeb threw a lot of money at the screen for ""A Dance."" It boasts a star-studded cast, wonderful clothes, jewels, cars and interiors, and was made on location.  The big ballroom scenes feature not only crowds of beautifully garbed extras, but historically correct bands and orchestras making music to swoon for.  Furthermore, as it was made for BBC4, the Beeb's experimental arm, it boasts the occasional full-frontal female nudity, too.Part I begins with our narrator, Nick Jenkins, at what the English oddly call a public school, while we would call it private: Eton, shortly after the end of the first world war.  We meet his two best friends, Charles Stringham and Peter Templer.  Also Kenneth Widmerpool, outcast at the school, with whom they will continuously come into contact later.  Jenkins is played by the handsome young James D'Arcy, who has only become a bigger star over the years.  His Uncle Giles is played by Edward Fox: Simon Russell Beale does a remarkable job as Widmerpool.  As Jenkins moves on to Oxford, we'll meet Allan Bennett as Sillery, one of the more powerful dons there.In Part II, we suddenly meet James Purefoy as the somewhat older Jenkins; also, a 95-year old John Gielgud playing the best-known novelist of the age, the supposed-to-be 60 year old St. John Clarke.  Zoe Wanamaker plays Audrey McLintock, a mover and shaker in the artistic circles Jenkins frequents. The depression has hit; many characters have moved leftward politically, some all the way to the Communist Party; Widmerpool has begun his irresistible ascent to power, prestige and wealth.  World War II is casting its shadow forward.  But, by and large, most of the younger characters are having enjoyable, busy sex lives, running off with each other's husbands, wives, and, perhaps, goats....Part III finds us in wartime.  The insufferable Widmerpool continues his rise in the world, and comes to dominate the show more and more.  The war seems, to this viewer, to aid him in dispatching a couple of his old enemies.  He will marry Stringham's beautiful but very ""difficult"" niece Pamela Flitton, well-played by the beautiful young Miranda Richardson.  Jenkins establishes his literary career, and meets the girl of his dreams, Isabella, of a family based either on the well-known literary Longfords, or Mitfords: I'd guess the Longfords, but you'd have to know more than I do about these people to be sure.Part IV is the weakest of the series.  The makers have fooled around with Powell's timeline, trying to stretch things out to more contemporaneous times, and have also suddenly foisted John Standing, as Jenkins, and Joanna David, as Isabella, upon us: nor does Standing look much like his predecessor in the part.  All parties concerned have a good time with the craziness of the 1960's; rebellious youth, hippies and swamis make hay. Widmerpool has achieved wealth, power, and prestige; he's been made a life peer - as has Sillery -- and chancellor of a major university.  But has he achieved contentment?If you can't get enough of this sort of thing that the British do so well, then here's something more to enjoy.",3,"Over Stuffed, But Full of Plums",1205539200,"03 15,

747638,A1PHVLYS6T4YW5,B00008V6ZP,T. Berner,"[3, 4]","Anthony Powell's 12 volume Dance to the Music of Time is the perhaps the best English language novel of the twentieth century. It is certainly a contender, but it is about as impossible a novel to convert to film as you can find. Given that constraint, this is a terrific attempt to do so.The key parts of the novel are faithfully copied: the trajectory of Widmerpool from buffoon to man of authority to power mad monster and back to buffoon; Nicholas Jenkins calm and grounded personality; the appearance, disappearance and reappearance of minor characters; the nature of coincidence and sirendipity of life; and many of the other themes are here.Some new scenes are helpful - for instance, Jenkins sitting in a museum while a guide explains the theme of the painting from whichthe novel borrows the title - but everyone will miss something from the books.For me, the most disappointing change was the way Charles Stringham's demise is related. Stringham's sad broken life is redeemed with dignity and honor in the books with an extraordinary scene after the war when Jenkins runs across his former commanding officer. Instead of the brief line (wonderfully charged with unspoken respect), ""he did well in the camps,"" you instead get a gratuitous scene of Japanese troops beating Stringham to death.But given everything the filmmakers have done well, you have to ask whether they have been faithful to the overall tone of the books. And they certainly have done so.In some cases, the filmmakers have wisely used different actors to portray the same person but have done their best to preserve continuity. For instance, although three actors play Nicholas Jenkins and the last two have quite different looks, the actors are so superb at portraying the same personality that you immediately accept the new actor as the same person.Another thing they have done well is to have kept the characters to a manageable number. Brilliant as the Dance is, it has to be read with one of the available guidebooks in hand so that you can remind yourself who a character is when he reappears two books and 500 pages after the last time he appeared. It is remarkable that the technique has been maintained but simplified so that you don't scramble to figure out who someone is.Anyone who loved the novel must see the movie. It adds richness and texture to one of the most extraordinary literary works of our time.",5,The Best Possible Shot at an Impossible Task,1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,2398,"['Anthony', 'Powell', '12', 'volume', 'Dance', 'Music', 'Time', 'perhaps', 'best', 'English', 'language', 'novel', 'twentieth', 'century', 'certainly', 'contender', 'about', 'impossible', 'novel', 'convert', 'film', 'can', 'find', 'Given', 'constraint', 'terrific', 'attempt', 'do', 'so.The', 'key', 'parts', 'novel', 'are', 'faithfully', 'copied', 'trajectory', 'Widmerpool', 'buffoon', 'man', 'authority', 'power', 'mad', 'monster', 'back', 'buffoon', 'Nicholas', 'Jenkins', 'calm', 'grounded', 'personality', 'appearance', 'disappearance', 'reappearance', 'minor', 'characters', 'nature', 'coincidence', 'sirendipity', 'life', 'many', 'other', 'themes', 'are', 'here.Some', 'new', 'scenes', 'are', 'helpful', 'instance', 'Jenkins', 'sitting', 'museum', 'guide', 'theme', 'painting', 'whichthe', 'novel', 'title', 'everyone', 'will', 'miss', 'something', 'books.For', 'most', 'disappointing', 'change', 'was', 'way', 'Charles', 'Stringham', 'demise', 'related', 'Stringham', 'sad', 'broken', 'life', 'redeemed', 'dignity', 'honor', 'books', 'extraordinary', 'scene', 'war', 'when', 'Jenkins', 'former', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Instead', 'brief', 'line', 'wonderfully', 'charged', 'unspoken', 'respect', 'did', 'well', 'camps', 'instead', 'get', 'gratuitous', 'scene', 'Japanese', 'troops', 'beating', 'Stringham', 'death.But', 'given', 'everything', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'have', 'ask', 'have', 'been', 'faithful', 'overall', 'tone', 'books', 'certainly', 'have', 'done', 'so.In', 'cases', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'wisely', 'used', 'different', 'actors', 'portray', 'same', 'person', 'have', 'done', 'best', 'preserve', 'continuity', 'instance', 'three', 'actors', 'play', 'Nicholas', 'Jenkins', 'last', 'two', 'have', 'quite', 'different', 'looks', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'superb', 'portraying', 'same', 'personality', 'immediately', 'accept', 'new', 'actor', 'same', 'person.Another', 'thing', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'have', 'kept', 'characters', 'manageable', 'number', 'Brilliant', 'Dance', 'be', 'read', 'one', 'available', 'guidebooks', 'hand', 'so', 'can', 'remind', 'who', 'character', 'when', 'two', 'books', '500', 'pages', 'last', 'time', 'appeared', 'remarkable', 'technique', 'been', 'maintained', 'simplified', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'scramble', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'someone', 'is.Anyone', 'who', 'loved', 'novel', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'richness', 'texture', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'literary', 'works', 'time']",N/A
747639,A2GR77QCSCF3ZE,B00008V6ZP,"Ted L. Reinert ""Ted L. Reinert""","[48, 48]","A valiant effort, but a forlorn hope:  Anthony Powell's wonderful 12-volume series ""A Dance to the Music of Time"" simply cannot be told, nor its essence captured, in eight hours:  briskness is antithetical to Powell's purpose.  The plot is consistently interesting throughout the books, but the atmosphere, personality and social history conveyed in them are really what make the books worth reading:  they are very nearly everything.  These things take time to make themselves be felt, yet this production scurries through the story like a blinkered Atalanta, never stopping to pick up the golden apples strewn at her feet.  Inevitable comparisons have been made to ""Brideshead Revisited,"" whose author was a great fan of Powell's work (hardly surprising, since Powell's prose is often reminiscent of Waugh's), but whereas the ""Brideshead"" series spent nearly eleven hours to dramatize a single 350-page book (which works out to a leisurely 32 pages per hour), this newer series attempts to dramatize twelve 300-page books in a scant eight hours -- that's approximately 450 pages an hour, a pace that would cross the eyes of the world's fastest speed reader.  While Powell's tone and concerns are closely related to those of ""Brideshead""'s, this series has more in common with Evelyn Wood than Evelyn Waugh.  It is hard to imagine trying to follow the plot of this series without having first read the books . . . more than once.Still, the production is often quite beautiful (though there are a few scenes that look as if they were shot on the cheap); the acting is generally excellent, with a few really wonderful performances -- Sir John Gielgud zips through his role amusingly; so does Edward Fox, who pops up several times in the first few hours; as Charles Stringham in the war years, Paul Rhys is particularly memorable and has what is probably the best scene in the entire series.  The author's alter-ego, Nicholas Jenkins, is played by three utterly dissimilar actors; he somehow manages to grow several inches shorter upon leaving school and then abruptly ages 30 to 35 years about six and a half hours into it.  As the odious, ubiquitous Widmerpool, Simon Russell Beale is the only main character to play his role from beginning to end.  It's a lovely, funny performance.  It must be noted, however, that he is hardly believable as a 17 year old and looks even more bizarre in the final hour, as he capers about in an obvious rubber baldpate, but these errors cannot reasonably be scored against him.The greatest shame, I suppose, is that after this expensive, lengthy (but not lengthy enough) and unsatisfactory dud, there is probably no longer any chance that these books will ever be given a proper dramatization.",3,Flashdance,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,2728,"['valiant', 'effort', 'forlorn', 'hope', 'Anthony', 'Powell', 'wonderful', '12-volume', 'series', 'Dance', 'Music', 'Time', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'essence', 'captured', 'eight', 'hours', 'briskness', 'antithetical', 'Powell', 'purpose', 'plot', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'books', 'atmosphere', 'personality', 'social', 'history', 'conveyed', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'make', 'books', 'worth', 'reading', 'are', 'very', 'nearly', 'everything', 'things', 'take', 'time', 'make', 'be', 'felt', 'yet', 'production', 'story', 'blinkered', 'Atalanta', 'never', 'stopping', 'pick', 'up', 'golden', 'apples', 'strewn', 'feet', 'Inevitable', 'comparisons', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'author', 'was', 'great', 'fan', 'Powell', 'work', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'Powell', 'prose', 'often', 'reminiscent', 'Waugh', 'Brideshead', 'series', 'spent', 'nearly', 'eleven', 'hours', 'dramatize', 'single', '350-page', 'book', 'out', 'leisurely', '32', 'pages', 'hour', 'newer', 'series', 'attempts', 'dramatize', 'twelve', '300-page', 'books', 'scant', 'eight', 'hours', 'approximately', '450', 'pages', 'hour', 'pace', 'would', 'cross', 'eyes', 'world', 'fastest', 'speed', 'reader', 'Powell', 'tone', 'concerns', 'are', 'closely', 'related', 'Brideshead', 'series', 'more', 'common', 'Evelyn', 'Wood', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'hard', 'imagine', 'trying', 'follow', 'plot', 'series', 'having', 'first', 'read', 'books', 'more', 'once.Still', 'production', 'often', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'look', 'were', 'shot', 'cheap', 'acting', 'generally', 'excellent', 'few', 'really', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'role', 'amusingly', 'so', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'who', 'up', 'several', 'times', 'first', 'few', 'hours', 'Charles', 'Stringham', 'war', 'years', 'Paul', 'Rhys', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'what', 'probably', 'best', 'scene', 'entire', 'series', 'author', 'alter-ego', 'Nicholas', 'Jenkins', 'played', 'three', 'utterly', 'dissimilar', 'actors', 'grow', 'several', 'inches', 'shorter', 'leaving', 'school', 'then', 'abruptly', '30', '35', 'years', 'six', 'half', 'hours', 'odious', 'ubiquitous', 'Widmerpool', 'Simon', 'Russell', 'Beale', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'play', 'role', 'beginning', 'end', 'lovely', 'funny', 'performance', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'however', 'hardly', 'believable', '17', 'year', 'old', 'even', 'more', 'bizarre', 'final', 'hour', 'obvious', 'rubber', 'baldpate', 'errors', 'can', 'not', 'reasonably', 'be', 'scored', 'him.The', 'greatest', 'shame', 'suppose', 'expensive', 'lengthy', 'not', 'lengthy', 'enough', 'unsatisfactory', 'dud', 'probably', 'no', 'longer', 'chance', 'books', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'given', 'proper', 'dramatization']",N/A

I can relatemore to the later chapters of this comedy-drama as the highly priviledgedpeople in it move from middle age to old age as most of us do.I remember a quotation from 1972, which Bill Moyers quoted back then:""We have gone from Youth to Decadence without an intervening Golden Age.""I think this quotation summarizes the experiences of the characters here.They experience life just after The Great War in the 1920's with almost everything in life in front of them.  Then they experience the vagariesof experiences after youth and are not really encouraged by the passageof time.  There is really no Golden Age for any of them from the 1930'sto the 1970's, and many of them do not survive that far.I feel a note of sadness in the end as nearly everyone in the story isdead and I wonder, ""What was all this for?""The cast is excellent, but the story is hard to follow at times.However, I am glad I discovered this series ten years after it was televised.
