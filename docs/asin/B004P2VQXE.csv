1423184,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B004P2VQXE,Amit Talpade,"[0, 0]","Kim Ji Won directed this serial killer story of murder and revenge which is served frozen and has enough scenes to send chills down your spine. The story is about a serial killer Kyung Chol (Min-sik Choi) who murders the daughter of a retired police commissioner and pregnant fianc&eacute; of special agent Soo-hyun ( Byung Hun). The special agent finds the serial killer and beats him up senselessly but not killing him, instead he implants a tracking device which would enable him to locate his whereabouts. So every time this serial killer is about to kill someone, the fianc&eacute; reaches the scene and not only stops the killing but keeps on ratcheting the beatings on the serial killer. The cat and mouse game is what makes this movie engaging and also features some of the most brutal scenes of violence and torture that I have seen in a long time. For example, just how many times can someone be beaten on the forehead with random objects before they are knocked down senseless or how about ripping someone's jaw with your bare hands? The lunatic nature of the serial killer and the single mindedness of the cop are what drive the entertainment. The many conversations, confrontation that they have at various points are worth watching and superbly filmed. The film could have simply become one of the spatter movies but the direction, story, the visual treatment,  camera work, drama and the fine acting make this film a worth watch. I strongly recommend this film however some film may find the mutilation, excretion, cannibalism too much to handle for those I suggest keeping a bucket nearby. 4 stars. 6/12/11",4,A  superb tasting course in gore and violence.,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1622,"['Kim', 'Ji', 'Won', 'directed', 'serial', 'killer', 'story', 'murder', 'revenge', 'served', 'frozen', 'enough', 'scenes', 'send', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'Kyung', 'Chol', 'Min-sik', 'Choi', 'who', 'daughter', 'retired', 'police', 'commissioner', 'pregnant', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'special', 'agent', 'Soo-hyun', 'Byung', 'Hun', 'special', 'agent', 'serial', 'killer', 'beats', 'up', 'senselessly', 'not', 'killing', 'instead', 'tracking', 'device', 'would', 'enable', 'locate', 'whereabouts', 'So', 'time', 'serial', 'killer', 'kill', 'someone', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'scene', 'not', 'only', 'killing', 'ratcheting', 'beatings', 'serial', 'killer', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'what', 'movie', 'engaging', 'also', 'most', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'violence', 'torture', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'example', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'someone', 'be', 'beaten', 'forehead', 'random', 'objects', 'are', 'knocked', 'down', 'senseless', 'how', 'ripping', 'someone', 'jaw', 'bare', 'hands', 'lunatic', 'nature', 'serial', 'killer', 'single', 'mindedness', 'cop', 'are', 'what', 'drive', 'entertainment', 'many', 'conversations', 'confrontation', 'have', 'various', 'points', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'superbly', 'filmed', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'become', 'one', 'spatter', 'movies', 'direction', 'story', 'visual', 'treatment', 'camera', 'work', 'drama', 'fine', 'acting', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watch', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'however', 'film', 'may', 'find', 'mutilation', 'excretion', 'cannibalism', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'suggest', 'keeping', 'bucket', 'nearby', '4', 'stars', '6/12/11']",N/A
1423185,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B004P2VQXE,Armando N. Roman,"[2, 2]","Chances are that if you're interested in I Saw the Devil, you've probably seen at least one of the Vengeance Trilogy movies. If you have, then there isn't a whole lot new in this movie that you haven't seen before, but I don't mean that in a bad way. I Saw the Devil seems to borrow some of the best elements from each movie to the point where they could practically release another box set, a quadrilogy, including this film with the others, despite having a different director. It's funny that, like Oldboy, before I saw this movie, all I'd heard was that it was extremely 'brutal' and 'unforgiving'. I don't know if it's just being desensitized from the Vengeance Trilogy or what, but I Saw the Devil didn't win me over as much as Oldboy or Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance did. As much as I hate to compare movies to one another, it's hard not to in this case. But the thing is, if you like revenge movies, or are a big fan of the Vengeance Trilogy, there's a good chance that you'll like I Saw the Devil as well.Soo-hyun is a secret agent spending the night at work while his fianc&eacute;, Ju-yeon, gets stuck on the side of the road after getting a flat tire. A tow truck is on the way, but before it arrives, a stranger pulls over and offers to help her out. She politely turns him down, and within minutes he smashes her windows and drags her off to a dank torture room of sorts, and kills her off quickly. Ju-yeon's head is found in a stream soon after, and both her father, a retired police chief, and Soo-hyun see what's happened. Upon seeing this, Soo-hyun vows to find the person who killed her, and make them suffer just as much as she did. Within days, he tracks the guy down- it's a school van driver named Kyung-chul. Soo-hyun nearly beats him to death, but leaves before the final blow. Why does he let the maniac live? Because he's just getting started.It's going to sound weird, but even with the guy being the lowest of low, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him when Soo-hyun would pay him a visit. Soo-hyun really does a number on Kyung-chul the first time, but it gets worse each and every time, to the point where it seems like a demented version of hide and seek. The violence isn't over the top, since each bit of it is there for a reason, and what's seen looks like it's genuinely happening to the actors. Knowing that Kyung-chul was about to get obliterated every couple of minutes got to the point where it was comical because you knew that he was going to be let go each time. And part of the fun is in seeing how the guy makes it to his next destination. Other killers and innocent people going about their daily lives in broad daylight aren't safe from Kyung-chul. I really did feel bad for Soo-hyun and Ju-yeon's father when she was killed and they pulled out her head. The reactions on their faces looked sincere, as did the lack of emotion on Kyung-chul's face whenever he got his hands on a victim. Whether it's intentional or not, I still couldn't help but feel like a few things were taken from the Vengeance Trilogy and altered a bit. Achilles tendon scene like Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance? Check! Fancy black coat like Lady Vengeance's? Check! There were other parts, and again, I'm not saying that this is bad or makes the movie score lower or anything, but the connections are there for someone who's seen those movies. Actually, there's not much about the movie that I don't like, aside from the slightly long runtime. The main character can seem bland, but when it's over and done, it comes together. I Saw the Devil has thrills, comedy, just the right amount of gore, and a somewhat painful ending. It's a solid movie.The blu-ray has great picture quality for the most part, aside from a few scenes shot at night with lots of black where grain shows up now and then. The movie isn't shot in any gorgeous areas by any means, but the cities and country look good here. The audio is very good too, with a nice DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and an English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 dub if you want to go that way. Unfortunately, there aren't many special features: there are a handful of deleted scenes, a short behind the scenes featurette and trailers for other Magnolia movies. Ouch.This movie does many things right thanks to good writing, directing, acting and cinematography. They have a merciless killer and make him interesting without going too deep like other movies I've seen in recent years, and put him in an interesting cat-and-mouse situation. But I still can't shake off the feeling of 'been there, done that', which is something I wish I could look past. Still, anyone who enjoys a good revenge movie will most likely love I Saw the Devil, but the lack of extras on the blu-ray hurts the score a bit when there's so much more they could've thrown on. Even if it weren't for that, I give the movie itself 4/5 stars. I wanted to say a lot more about the movie, but so much goes on with torture scenes and story bits involving the two main characters that I don't want to give away too much. Give this one a rental at the very least.",4,"Sympathy For Mr. Lady Oldboy Vengeance.

The main character's wife was killed too soon, and he caught the killer way way way too soon. There could have been an aspect of mystery, but there wasn't even a hint of it. His father in law literally just gives him the names and pictures of 3 sex offenders, and one of them happens to be the killer. Then, since he's captured the killer so early, and they don't want to torture him for an hour of film time, he just lets him go. Yes, the idea's original, and I could see this happen as he loves the thrill of the hunt. However, how he does it makes no sense. He just breaks the serial killer's hand, and then lets him go kill and terrorize other people. If you're going to let him go, at least cut his hands off so he can't kill people, or stay close to him, or take him to some sort of game preserve where you can be sure he can't kill anyone else. I would have wholly embraced more torture, but really the film was pretty tame.

1423195,A3LX5ELWX6HYK6,B004P2VQXE,Caligula II.,"[2, 3]","I SAW THE DEVIL is refreshingly different from most thrillers. What I loved most about it is the non-existance of the line between good and evil. The protagonist (Byung-hun Lee) is out for revenge, chasing the antagonist (Min-sik Choi), but instead of simply killing him, he literally puts him through hell: ""I will kill you when you are in the most pain, shivering out of fear... Then I will kill you."" Still his actions are understandable and he remains sympathetic till the very end.The violence is bloody and intense and often drawn out: it doesn't suffice to bash that hammer on someone's head just once, no it has to be done several time and the camera does not pan out, so fans of bload-soaked entertainment are in for a real treat, as are fans of very suspenseful and non-stereotype thrillers. I SAW THE DEVIL is incredibly well-paced and keeps you at the edge of your seat.As I mentioned it is not for the squeamish, cannibalism is also a theme in this movie (though not shown in great detail), the violence is raw und brutal (makes Tarantino movies looks like kiddie movies by comparison) and the general mood rather downbeat, which is suitable. It will haunt you even after the end credits roll, this is not a movie one can easily forget!The acting is quite good overall with outstanding performances by the two main characters Byung-hun Lee and Min-sik Choi (seen in the original Oldboy).The blu-ray contains the uncut international print (approx. 2 mins. had to be cut to satisfy the Korean ratings board, this version was also released in England, but we were luckier!). The picture quality is brilliant. Highly recommended quality Korean filmmaking - Thrillers donn't get better than this.

If you don't like a lot of violence, pass this one up because there is a truckload of it.  If you're game to try or already are, take a good look at this one.  I've never watched a Korean film of any genre before last night, but of all the serial killer/revenge films I've checked out so far, this one has been the most original and the best:  It's straight forward and to the point, so you're not missing any pretentious symboism other films like the horrible Horsemen was trying to convey.Private detective Kim Soo-hyeon ((Byung-hun Lee) is out to get serial killer Kyung Chul (Min-sik Choi) for the brutal, grotesque murder of his pregnant fiancee' Joo-Yeon (San-ha Oh).  He doesn't just want to get him, though, he wants to torture him relentlessly by nearly beating him to death, then drawing back and letting him get away repeatedly.  You can't call it a game of cat and mouse because neither of them are mice in their behavior.  Soo-hyeon  has shoved a tracking device and microphone down Kyung Chul's throat so he'll always know where he his and, in the process, stops him from murdering and torturing a few other women, which is good.  What isn't good is that Soo-hyeon is so overcome in his rage that he isn't taking time to grieve, and his anger is making him something parallel to Kyung Chul.  As his equally demented friend points out, he loves hunt as much as they do.Unlike other films of this genre, it is completely fast paced from beginning to end with a good, simple story and it shows the dark side of a good person and the humorous side of a dark and evil person.  Although Kyung Chul is truly repulsive, he is also funny at times, and it's welcome amidst the disturbing and violent nature of this film.I do not intend to give anything about the ending away, except to say, there is closure, but it is something of an unsatisfactory one.  ""Who do you think won?""  Kyung Chul asks his persuer.  It all depends on your perspective in the final half-hour of the movie.  I say neither of them did because of the cost to both of them and the people involved in their revenge games.  The movie is long, but it's such a good story if you can get past the gore.

Agonizing torture and bloody revenge have never looked as ravishing as the director of A TALE OF TWO SISTERS offers up his next masterful entry in to the genre. The stunning cinematography and fluid fight choreography from which each of his action sequences are composed can only be compared to the works of Chan-wook Park in their graceful beauty, despite the horrific and ultra-violent images that are being displayed on screen. Min-sik Choi of OLDBOY renown bests even his finest performances in his depiction of the charismatic killer, Kyung-chul. After luring his prey with an innocent smile, Choi reveals a cold and heartless interior that is chilling to the bone. Byung-hun Lee must become divest of all emotion, as well, if he is to track and destroy his fiancee's killer as the vengeful Soo-hyeon Kim. The cat and mouse game in which he catches and releases Kyung-chul in order to prolong his torment constantly calls in to question the meaning of good and evil, when Kim commits many of the same sinister acts in the name of revenge. It isn't until Kim sees the futility of his actions that the swell of emotions finally springs forth as he realizes that the violence and vengeance that he has wrought will bring no further satisfaction or closure towards his fiancee's death.

1423202,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004P2VQXE,C. Sawin,"[51, 64]","Director Jee-woon Kim along with actors Byung-hun Lee and Min-sik Choi are three of the most talented people in Korean cinema today. Jee-woon has done such films as A Bittersweet Life and The Good, the Bad, the Weird, which both starred Byung-hun and Min-sik is most recognized for his performance in Oldboy, but was also fairly impressive in the drama Crying Fist among many others. Oldboy is really the film that made me love Korean cinema. So when word broke that these three marvelous people were getting together to make a film, I knew I was already there. A little thriller called I Saw the Devil came together and became one of the most spectacularly intense thrillers to be released in quite some time.Late one snowy, winter night, a woman named Joo-yeon (San-ha Oh) sits stranded in her car waiting for a tow truck to arrive and help her fix a flat tire. She talks to her fiance, Dae-hoon (Byung-hun), over the phone as she waits. It's Joo-yeon's birthday and Dae-hoon, a secret agent, gets caught up with work and can't be there with her on her special day. A strange man shows up and begins to pester Joo-yeon about fixing the tire himself. After declining his help, the man known as Kyung-chul (Min-sik) attacks Joo-yeon before brutally murdering her. Kyung-chul is actually a notorious serial killer who mostly kills women and young girls. As the investigation unfolds, Dae-hoon swears merciless revenge on Kyung-chul and a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. Does Dae-hoon really know when this game will end or has he already become a bigger monster than the man he now preys upon?The chemistry between Byung-hun Lee and Min-sik Choi is what really drives the film. Byung-Hun is the broken down shell of a man when he's not in the hunt, so to speak. He has several emotional breakdowns that are incredibly heart wrenching, but the urge he has to make this bloodthirsty maniac pay for taking the love of his life away takes a front seat to any sort of emotion he once had. Byung-hun portrays the struggle his character has between sadness and revenge flawlessly. Min-sik plays the role of a lunatic incredibly well. His character seems to lack that which makes a person who they are; morals, a conscience, and above all a soul. Killing is the only thing that brings out the real Kyung-Chul. His first initial reaction to someone trying to beat him at his own game is agitation and borderline out of control rage, but once he regains control he not only enjoys himself but claims it's the most fun he's ever had. Min-sik acts level headed when his kills go well, but the way he expresses how insane his character really is when things go bad for him is what makes his performance so memorable. While the scenes where Byung-hun and Min-sik fight with each other are great for obvious reasons, there's a scene at the end of the film where they both have a heart to heart conversation that is just spectacular. Every little glimpse you have of that confrontation leading up to that point is fantastic, as well.Jee-woon Kim certainly knows how to shoot a beautiful looking film. Lush and vibrant colors make grisly murders and spontaneous revenge tactics look much more pleasant than the blood that endlessly splatters all over every wall and floor in the film. Other than the brilliant colors, the cinematography is rather unique as well. There's a scene near the end of the film where Dae-Hoon is walking toward the camera on a deserted road. It's simple and shot like we're basically walking backwards in front of him while staring directly at his face. He eventually begins to cry; an uncontrollable sobbing. The way the scene is shot along with Byung-hun's performance made it one of the more memorable scenes in the film. There's another where Kyung-Chul gets picked up by a taxi. He gets into the front passenger seat while there's another man in the back, so there are three people in the car altogether including the driver. Kyung-Chul realizes he's going to have to beat these guys to the punch, so as their adrenaline escalates the camera rotates around the inside of the car. You get this continuous 360 degree shot of the action occurring inside this cab. It's amazing.Leave it to another Korean thriller revolving around revenge to make an impression on me. Jee-woon Kim's I Saw the Devil is a superbly acted, exceptionally written, grotesquely gorgeous film that'll make you cringe during some of the more horrific and blood soaked acts in the film while secretly leave you craving so much more.

Director Ji Woon-Kim's South Korea seems to be liberally sprinkled with psychopaths, which leads to some of the best set pieces in the film and some moments of very dark comedy.  The overall tone of the film, however, is very sad and makes the point that revenge is ultimately unsatisfying, dehumanizing to the perpetrator, and can lead down some unexpected paths.  I shave a star from this excellent thriller because I felt it was a bit too long.  More importantly, I felt it held many of the murder and torture scenes just a beat too long, crossing the line from depicting horrendous acts to vicariously participating in them.  Of course, that line is very subjective and many viewers will not agree at all or may feel that the line was crossed long before I did.  Perhaps it was even Ji Woon-Kim's intention to implicate the viewer in the violence as some sort of meta-cognitive point about the voyeurism of film.  For my taste, this fine movie would have been improved by trimming some of those scenes a bit.  I understand that the South Korean film board required about ninety seconds to be cut before it could be released there.  I can imagine just where those cuts may have been.",4,"When you look into the abyss, the abyss looks into you",1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,1394,"['secret', 'agent', 'Lee', 'Byung-hoon', 'surveillance', 'technology', 'track', 'torment', 'serial', 'killer', 'Choi', 'Min-sik', 'who', 'murdered', 'wife', 'Oh', 'San-ha', '.This', 'intense', 'graphic', 'film', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'Director', 'Ji', 'Woon-Kim', 'South', 'Korea', 'be', 'liberally', 'sprinkled', 'psychopaths', 'best', 'set', 'pieces', 'film', 'moments', 'very', 'dark', 'comedy', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'however', 'very', 'sad', 'point', 'revenge', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'dehumanizing', 'perpetrator', 'can', 'lead', 'down', 'unexpected', 'paths', 'shave', 'star', 'excellent', 'thriller', 'felt', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'More', 'importantly', 'felt', 'held', 'many', 'murder', 'torture', 'scenes', 'just', 'beat', 'too', 'long', 'crossing', 'line', 'depicting', 'horrendous', 'acts', 'vicariously', 'participating', 'course', 'line', 'very', 'subjective', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'agree', 'may', 'feel', 'line', 'was', 'crossed', 'long', 'did', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'even', 'Ji', 'Woon-Kim', 'intention', 'implicate', 'viewer', 'violence', 'sort', 'meta-cognitive', 'point', 'voyeurism', 'film', 'taste', 'fine', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'trimming', 'scenes', 'bit', 'understand', 'South', 'Korean', 'film', 'board', 'required', 'ninety', 'seconds', 'be', 'cut', 'could', 'be', 'released', 'there', 'can', 'imagine', 'just', 'where', 'cuts', 'may', 'have', 'been']",N/A
1423204,AY4EXFOO43C3S,B004P2VQXE,"David Bradford ""David""","[0, 7]","1) The acting is not that bad. Low ratings could be the result of stereotyping of Asians.2) Characters all seem plausble.3) Certainly the killer had to know that cleaning of the scene does not defeat current day forensics in S. Korea.4) The running of water from clear to red during the ""cut up"" scene was a bit korny but then this type of ""change"" technique is currently in N. American films.5) A bit crowded during the search scene and some unnecessary excitement but no worse than in many recently developed countries. A bit more understanding of Korean culture could help these low reviewers out.6) The funeral scene was not as solemn as typical N. American funerals. This is S. Korea so respect it.used in highly rated N. American movies to this day.7) The scene of the first suspect to be ""tortured"" is a bit cheap overall but does not reflect to total average quality of the film thus far.8) The hospital scene is beleivable.9) The second suspect apprehension is quick and undetailed but realistic.10) The bus stop scene where the actual antagonist shows up is realistic and well acted. Don't understand why she did not try to get out of the van, other than Korean cultural impact on the behavior of women.11) The kill scene of the second victim is realistic and not worse than Kill Bill Vol. 1 or any of the Saw series.12) Note: It seems a bit slow, on the average, as the protagonist begins to discover, at the home of the last suspect, damning evidence.13) I guess the audience needs to think that tracking devices blink.....14) Since when does this guy like sex? This changes his overall MO. I am not an FBI profiler but this still seems to break a pattern of behavior. He has stripped his victims before but why the active sex angle now?15) The fight scene during the apprehension of the antagonist is realistic except the rock was a bit large.16) Don't understand the money yet. Adds a bit a thrill. Good bridge by the writer since I have not seen this twist. I could toss a lot of thoughts by but lets see.... He wants to hunt him?17) Taxi scene... Some thrill before the stabbing and during. From what I understand about stabbing murders, when one desires a quick kill, many wounds may be required to expedited bleeding.18) I question the sloppiness that has caused the loss of the antagonist.19) Doctor's office: Why leave a bloody trail vs. a mind trail? He can't help himself? The sex comes up again. Does this guy have two patterns? Guess I overlooked the bug. When/where did he plant this? Why use a padded chair to beat him? Guess crime is not perfect. Permanent limp now. It is a hunt for sure. That is the torure. About 5/6 thru all that needs to be seen are the details. I assume the movie is done now, let's see..20) The family conversation is entirely realistic but a smart cop would not have made it so obvious on what would be a likely to be tapped line.21) Looks like this bad guy has family. What are the dogs eating? What kind of meat is that other guy( his son?) eating? Yup.... The hunt is reaffirmed as most know it by now.22) He likes being hunted and begins to hypothesize?23) The thoughts really gory now as he likes his flesh fresh off the hoof. Does the film take it all the way?24) Okay now, I do see a problem with the antagonist's somn being alive?25) I see the same problem with the anatagonist too.. How can they be alive??26) It goes down hill from here only to prolong the story line. I have to comend the writing with some twists and turns. I am only watch the final 30 minutes due to curiosity and I paid for it. You should already know who will win. Bye Bye.Big Questions:I) Since when does the killing and dismemberment of two Asian women ( without much detail ) and one clothed almost rape of one adolescent girl make this an Asian Chick Flick? Or, a super blood and gore flick? Does not seem like one overall.II) It is not that slow. But it becomes predictable a little over 1/2 way through. What is the fuss?III) The last fight scene changes pace a few times but it is puctiated by plenty of fast action. What is all of the fuss about?IV) Why are women always the victims of these crimes ... men always the perpetrators? Will this trend change as women begin to become the dominant gender? Women will become the dominant gender this century? But, what male/femal trends will alter and how?Affirmations:I) Yes there are some problems with the survivability of the culprits. It serves only to draw out the story line and it does become increasingly unecesarily gory during the last 30 minutes.",3,Moment by Moment Critique of Details,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,4544,"['1', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'Low', 'ratings', 'could', 'be', 'result', 'stereotyping', 'Asians.2', 'Characters', 'seem', 'plausble.3', 'Certainly', 'killer', 'had', 'know', 'cleaning', 'scene', 'not', 'defeat', 'current', 'day', 'forensics', 'S.', 'Korea.4', 'running', 'water', 'clear', 'red', 'cut', 'up', 'scene', 'was', 'bit', 'korny', 'then', 'type', 'change', 'technique', 'currently', 'N.', 'American', 'films.5', 'bit', 'crowded', 'search', 'scene', 'unnecessary', 'excitement', 'worse', 'many', 'recently', 'developed', 'countries', 'bit', 'more', 'understanding', 'Korean', 'culture', 'could', 'help', 'low', 'reviewers', 'out.6', 'funeral', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'solemn', 'typical', 'N.', 'American', 'funerals', 'S.', 'Korea', 'respect', 'it.used', 'highly', 'rated', 'N.', 'American', 'movies', 'day.7', 'scene', 'first', 'suspect', 'be', 'tortured', 'bit', 'cheap', 'overall', 'not', 'reflect', 'total', 'average', 'quality', 'film', 'thus', 'far.8', 'hospital', 'scene', 'beleivable.9', 'second', 'suspect', 'apprehension', 'quick', 'undetailed', 'realistic.10', 'bus', 'stop', 'scene', 'where', 'actual', 'antagonist', 'up', 'realistic', 'well', 'acted', 'Do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'get', 'van', 'other', 'Korean', 'cultural', 'impact', 'behavior', 'women.11', 'kill', 'scene', 'second', 'victim', 'realistic', 'not', 'worse', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Vol', '1', 'Saw', 'series.12', 'Note', 'bit', 'slow', 'average', 'protagonist', 'discover', 'home', 'last', 'suspect', 'damning', 'evidence.13', 'guess', 'audience', 'think', 'tracking', 'devices', 'blink', '..14', 'when', 'guy', 'sex', 'overall', 'MO', 'am', 'not', 'FBI', 'profiler', 'still', 'break', 'pattern', 'behavior', 'stripped', 'victims', 'why', 'active', 'sex', 'angle', 'now', '15', 'fight', 'scene', 'apprehension', 'antagonist', 'realistic', 'rock', 'was', 'bit', 'large.16', 'Do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'money', 'yet', 'Adds', 'bit', 'thrill', 'Good', 'bridge', 'writer', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'twist', 'could', 'toss', 'lot', 'thoughts', 'lets', 'see', 'hunt', '17', 'Taxi', 'scene', 'thrill', 'stabbing', 'what', 'understand', 'stabbing', 'murders', 'when', 'one', 'quick', 'kill', 'many', 'wounds', 'may', 'be', 'required', 'expedited', 'bleeding.18', 'question', 'sloppiness', 'caused', 'loss', 'antagonist.19', 'Doctor', 'office', 'Why', 'leave', 'bloody', 'trail', 'vs.', 'mind', 'trail', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'sex', 'up', 'again', 'guy', 'have', 'two', 'patterns', 'Guess', 'overlooked', 'bug', 'When/where', 'did', 'plant', 'Why', 'use', 'padded', 'chair', 'beat', 'Guess', 'crime', 'not', 'perfect', 'Permanent', 'limp', 'now', 'hunt', 'sure', 'torure', '5/6', 'thru', 'be', 'seen', 'are', 'details', 'assume', 'movie', 'done', 'now', 'let', 'see..20', 'family', 'conversation', 'entirely', 'realistic', 'smart', 'cop', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'so', 'obvious', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'be', 'tapped', 'line.21', 'bad', 'guy', 'family', 'What', 'are', 'dogs', 'eating', 'What', 'kind', 'meat', 'other', 'guy', 'son', 'eating', 'Yup', 'hunt', 'reaffirmed', 'most', 'know', 'now.22', 'being', 'hunted', 'hypothesize', '23', 'thoughts', 'really', 'gory', 'now', 'flesh', 'fresh', 'hoof', 'film', 'take', 'way', '24', 'Okay', 'now', 'do', 'see', 'problem', 'antagonist', 'somn', 'being', 'alive', '25', 'see', 'same', 'problem', 'anatagonist', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'alive', '26', 'down', 'hill', 'here', 'only', 'prolong', 'story', 'line', 'have', 'comend', 'writing', 'twists', 'turns', 'am', 'only', 'watch', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'due', 'curiosity', 'paid', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'Bye', 'Bye.Big', 'Questions', 'when', 'killing', 'dismemberment', 'two', 'Asian', 'women', 'much', 'detail', 'one', 'clothed', 'almost', 'rape', 'one', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'make', 'Asian', 'Chick', 'Flick', 'Or', 'super', 'blood', 'gore', 'flick', 'not', 'seem', 'one', 'overall.II', 'not', 'slow', 'predictable', 'little', '1/2', 'way', 'What', 'fuss', 'III', 'last', 'fight', 'scene', 'changes', 'pace', 'few', 'times', 'puctiated', 'plenty', 'fast', 'action', 'What', 'fuss', 'IV', 'Why', 'are', 'women', 'always', 'victims', 'crimes', 'men', 'always', 'perpetrators', 'Will', 'trend', 'change', 'women', 'begin', 'become', 'dominant', 'gender', 'Women', 'will', 'become', 'dominant', 'gender', 'century', 'what', 'male/femal', 'trends', 'will', 'alter', 'how', 'Affirmations', 'Yes', 'are', 'problems', 'survivability', 'culprits', 'only', 'draw', 'out', 'story', 'line', 'become', 'increasingly', 'unecesarily', 'gory', 'last', '30', 'minutes']",N/A

He of course wants revenge. The rest of the movie is him catching him, beating him and his lackies within seconds of death, putting a tracking device on him and then letting him go. With the lackies now in the hospital and out of the way, he plans to track his movements to do more damage to him in any way he can. This psycho is smarter than he thinks. Who is tracking and manipulating who?Some movies put good actors together and they still can't make a good movie (Green Hornet) but this is so well directed/produced and acted it needs mentioning.

As nifty as the plot might be, those of a more delicate constitution might be put off.Here's the scoop. A young woman in a stranded car is kidnapped, raped and sadistically murdered by a serial killer. Her fiance tracks him down, inserts a tracking device in him and visits him at regular intervals to inflict torturous pain on him. Of course things don't go quite according to plan for the fiance so he is forced to improvise.The only movie I've seen that is this upchuckingly gruesome is 'Martyrs.' This is only a tad more tolerable in that most of the pain is inflicted on a really bad person. It IS difficult to watch just the same. What helps is the plotting. As I've noted in other reviews of Korean movies is how they are able to take common genres or plots and spin them in a fresh way. There are turns that occur in this movie that you will not see coming. I just kept wondering where it was going to go next.The directing, acting and all other production values are top shelf. Some felt the near two and a half hour running time was a bit too long but it didn't bother me in the least.

The only problem I had with it was that the main character was so unbelievable.  I'm assuming the protagonist is a fairly intelligent man, seeing that he's a secret agent.  Plus he must possess high moral qualities considering his desire to enforce the law for his government.  But everything he does in this film reeks of amateurish mistakes and a lack of compassion for others.  What's worse, alot of innocent folks get assaulted, raped and killed as the protagonist proceeds with his revenge plan.  I mean he allows a school girl to get abducted and raped.  I understand that he wants revenge, but how can he in all good conscience allow this much wanton mayhem?  He must have known the serial killer would victimize other people along the way.  I'm sure they teach ""profiling 101"" in secret agent school.  It would have been a more powerful movie if he captured the serial killer, securely imprisoned him to ensure everyone's safety and proceeded to torture him ""HOSTEL"" style.

The story follows secret agent Soo-hyun path to revenge after his fiancee is murdered by the notorious serial killer Kyung-chul. Soo-Hyun is played brilliantly by Lee Byung-Hun; he is one of the best actors today, the revenge sequences are uncompromising as he shows his dark side, and his emotional scenes are powerful when he realizes his fiancee is dead and what he has turned into. On the other hand, Choi Min-Sik plays Kyung-chul; his performance is stunning as he plays a sinister serial killer, up to the very end when you realize he is the definition of evil. As you can see, I thought the acting was amazing. The story was dark and powerful, although a bit on the long side. It's not the most violent film ever, but it's not for the weak-hearted either; for example, Soo-Hyun vividly cuts Kyung-chul's Achilles tendon and continuously tortures him in unbelievable ways. This film does not follow a generic formula, so expect the unexpected. The ending was shocking and can leave you with mixed emotions; how far would you go for revenge?Overall, I Saw The Devil has brilliant acting, an uncompromising story, great direction, and amazing music. Some of the action-revenge sequences are also shot beautifully, by the way.

1423232,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004P2VQXE,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 4]","On a snowy night, Joo-yun (Oh San-ha) is stranded on the side of the road with a flat tire. A man, Kyung-chul (Min-sik Choi) pulls over and offers her a ride, which she declines. Kyung-chul proceeds to brutally beat her and kidnap her, only to later kill her and dismember her body. Her fianc&eacute;e, secret agent Soo-hyun (Lee Byung-hun), devastated by his loss, takes times off work, and vows to avenge her by finding the killer. But to hunt a monster, must Soo-hyun become a monster himself? I Saw the Devil begins like a straight-forward, cat-and-mouse revenge thriller but turns into a morality play that examines the monstrous nature buried in all of us and the capacity to commit monstrous acts when driven to do so.Directed by Kim Ji-woon, this Korean import has scenes that recall typical ""torture porn,"" but with a unique Korean sensibility in the direction. Elegantly shot by Lee Mo-gae, this is a beautiful film that could pass as an art film if not for the graphic and bloody scenes of violence. There are two scenes of such violence within the first 40 minutes alone. The difference between the violence here and the average teen-filled torture porn is that Kim Ji-woon knows what to show and when to show it. This film doesn't shy away from blood or gore, but employs trick angles to certain scenes to suggest more than it shows. There's a brutal stabbing in a car, with a lot of quick stabbing motions and blood, but very few shots of a knife penetrating a body. As the film progresses, the violence and mayhem seem to progress with it, becoming more graphic and vivid.Written by first-time screenwriter Park Hoon-jung, the film takes an unconventional premise and allows it to unfold in an unexpected way. Pitting a depraved killer, whose identity is never a mystery against a protagonist who is sympathetic, but not exactly admirable; Park Hoon-jung takes all the conventions of a cat-and-mouse revenge thriller and has fun playing with audience's expectations. This is not simply a film about a man chasing the monster who killed his fianc&eacute;e, but about a man who first wants to toy with that monster, vigilante style. With a GPS unknowingly implanted in his body, the film consists of Kyung-chul trying to hide from Soo-hyun, only to be beaten nearly to death at random intervals.The two lead actors really hold the film together. Lee Byung-hun has a very expressive face that allows him to convey his character effectively with very few words. One only needs to know the depth of his pain and determination to avenge his fianc&eacute;e by looking at his face throughout. Min-sik Choi, so normal in appearance, is very good as the killer, underplaying what could have been a flamboyant performance. He's never ominous and rarely menacing in the way killers tend to be in movies, yet his performance is completely convincing and thoughtful. Their final confrontation in particular has some mesmerizing acting work.I Saw the Devil reaches a stunning, unforgettable conclusion. It is a very dry film and with a 140-minute running time, feels too long occasionally. For such a violent film, it moves at a leisurely pace, taking time to develop its plot, characters, and motives before it explodes into absolute chaos. It is rare to see a film that alternates so easily between methodical character study and action packed suspense. It's great to look at, very well-made, and thought-provoking, but not exactly a fun film to watch. However, it is so brilliant and unforgettable at times, it's a force that can't be ignored. The graphic, brutal violence in films labeled ""torture porn"" has been written off as cheap, vulgar exploitation and it generally is. Here, a Korean director has found a way to use it appropriately and artistically. This is a very effective film, as impressive as it is surprising and it will appeal to both patient horror buffs and lovers of cinema alike.GRADE: B+",4,"A Beautiful, Violent, and Surprising Film",1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,3911,"['snowy', 'night', 'Joo-yun', 'Oh', 'San-ha', 'stranded', 'side', 'road', 'flat', 'tire', 'man', 'Kyung-chul', 'Min-sik', 'Choi', 'ride', 'Kyung-chul', 'proceeds', 'brutally', 'beat', 'kidnap', 'only', 'later', 'kill', 'dismember', 'body', 'Her', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'secret', 'agent', 'Soo-hyun', 'Lee', 'Byung-hun', 'devastated', 'loss', 'times', 'off', 'work', 'vows', 'avenge', 'finding', 'killer', 'hunt', 'monster', 'must', 'Soo-hyun', 'become', 'monster', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'straight-forward', 'cat-and-mouse', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'morality', 'play', 'monstrous', 'nature', 'buried', 'capacity', 'commit', 'monstrous', 'acts', 'when', 'driven', 'do', 'so.Directed', 'Kim', 'Ji-woon', 'Korean', 'import', 'scenes', 'recall', 'typical', 'torture', 'porn', 'unique', 'Korean', 'sensibility', 'direction', 'Elegantly', 'shot', 'Lee', 'Mo-gae', 'beautiful', 'film', 'could', 'pass', 'art', 'film', 'not', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'violence', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'such', 'violence', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'alone', 'difference', 'violence', 'here', 'average', 'teen-filled', 'torture', 'porn', 'Kim', 'Ji-woon', 'what', 'show', 'when', 'show', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'blood', 'gore', 'trick', 'angles', 'certain', 'scenes', 'suggest', 'more', 'brutal', 'stabbing', 'car', 'lot', 'quick', 'stabbing', 'motions', 'blood', 'very', 'few', 'shots', 'knife', 'penetrating', 'body', 'film', 'violence', 'mayhem', 'seem', 'progress', 'becoming', 'more', 'graphic', 'vivid.Written', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Park', 'Hoon-jung', 'film', 'unconventional', 'premise', 'unfold', 'unexpected', 'way', 'Pitting', 'depraved', 'killer', 'identity', 'never', 'mystery', 'protagonist', 'who', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'exactly', 'admirable', 'Park', 'Hoon-jung', 'conventions', 'cat-and-mouse', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'fun', 'playing', 'audience', 'expectations', 'not', 'simply', 'film', 'man', 'chasing', 'monster', 'who', 'killed', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'man', 'who', 'toy', 'monster', 'vigilante', 'style', 'GPS', 'unknowingly', 'implanted', 'body', 'film', 'Kyung-chul', 'trying', 'hide', 'Soo-hyun', 'only', 'be', 'beaten', 'nearly', 'death', 'random', 'intervals.The', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'really', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'Lee', 'Byung-hun', 'very', 'expressive', 'face', 'convey', 'character', 'effectively', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'One', 'only', 'know', 'depth', 'pain', 'determination', 'avenge', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'e', 'looking', 'face', 'Min-sik', 'Choi', 'so', 'normal', 'appearance', 'very', 'good', 'killer', 'underplaying', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'flamboyant', 'performance', 'never', 'ominous', 'rarely', 'menacing', 'way', 'killers', 'tend', 'be', 'movies', 'yet', 'performance', 'completely', 'convincing', 'thoughtful', 'final', 'confrontation', 'particular', 'mesmerizing', 'acting', 'work.I', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'stunning', 'unforgettable', 'conclusion', 'very', 'dry', 'film', '140-minute', 'running', 'time', 'feels', 'too', 'long', 'occasionally', 'such', 'violent', 'film', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'taking', 'time', 'develop', 'plot', 'characters', 'motives', 'absolute', 'chaos', 'rare', 'see', 'film', 'so', 'easily', 'methodical', 'character', 'study', 'action', 'packed', 'suspense', 'great', 'look', 'very', 'well-made', 'thought-provoking', 'not', 'exactly', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'However', 'so', 'brilliant', 'unforgettable', 'times', 'force', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'violence', 'films', 'labeled', 'torture', 'porn', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'cheap', 'vulgar', 'exploitation', 'generally', 'Here', 'Korean', 'director', 'found', 'way', 'use', 'appropriately', 'artistically', 'very', 'effective', 'film', 'as', 'impressive', 'surprising', 'will', 'appeal', 'patient', 'horror', 'buffs', 'lovers', 'cinema', 'alike.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

Unfortunately, that all goes mostly wasted in this insipid and silly revenge thriller.While modern Korean cinema has invented and perfected this ultra-violent noir genre of bad heroes doing bad things to even worse people, this film is essentially torture porn. In scene after scene of gruesome gore and human misery, the primary function of these sequences is to thrill, titillate and provoke the viewer with its ridiculous carnage. Defenders of the film will cite some elevated themes of morality, doom, justice, etc. at play here. But while the film may masquerade as a stirring drama about lost love or a heady rumination on the limits of justice, those are all the flimsiest of excuses to repeatedly showcase the gore and suffering.

1423242,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004P2VQXE,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","There are movies that you watch to be entertained by. There are movies you watch to experience a piece of art. And then there are movies that combine these two ideas and come out with something altogether different, a movie that entertains on some level and yet is so well made as to be considered art. I SAW THE DEVIL is one such film, a truly disturbing picture that will stay with you long after the final credits.The film opens in winter where a young woman's car has a flat. While speaking to her boyfriend, a secret agent, she is offered assistance by a bus driver which she declines. Once she hangs up, the bus driver viciously attacks her, breaking out the windows of her car and clubbing her into submission with a hammer. She awakes to find herself in a secluded location where her kidnapper systematically tortures and kills her, even after she pleads for not just her life but that of her unborn child.The victim's boyfriend Kim Soo-hyeon (Byung-hung Lee) is distraught by her murder. Contacting her father, an ex-police detective, he is given several leads as to who may have killed her and begins targeting each one. As he enacts his revenge on the first two in a most brutal fashion, he finds himself realizing that the third is the guilty party. Tracking him down is easy. What he does afterwards is not.Kim finds Kyung-chul (Min-Sik Choi) and nearly beats him to death. But he stops. His thirst for revenge would be short lived if he killed this monster. Instead he allows him to live with the knowledge that it isn't over. Kim becomes the hunter, thrilling at the hunt as he continues to track down Kyung. Kyung continues on a murderous rampage almost racking up several more victims but Kim always shows at the last minute and does more physical damage to Kyung.Readers may recall that I've found what is now called ""torture porn"" to be pretty distasteful, especially the film HOSTEL. There are many scenes in this film that rival HOSTEL for the sheer power of filmed torture. But there's a difference as well that some will squabble over. In HOSTEL we witnessed a movie in which voyeurs had the chance to become a part of the action, to pay to torture people, no more motivation than the so called thrill. In this film we witness a man whose memory is tortured for his not being there to save his fianc&eacute;, a man who is seeking out vengeance.I found myself watching and thinking what would I do given the same circumstances? Would I want to find vengeance on my own? If I had the skill set as the character of Kim has, the capabilities he displays in fighting and surveillance techniques, would I want to take my own pound of flesh from someone who had caused me such pain? I never did find an answer for my questions, just that there is the possibility that I would.The film continues with bloody encounters all the way from start to finish. There's even a stop by Kyung at a home invasion his friend has just done, a friend who enjoys cannibalism and is in the middle of eating one of his victims. But the encounters between Kyung and Kim as Kim nears the threshold of finally exacting his revenge are what make this movie click. It is witnessing Kim perhaps turn into the same monster he seeks in his search for revenge, perhaps not finally doing so, that holds our interest.A word of warning: This film is not for the weak of heart. It is not for anyone who would be offended or upset at witnessing some of the most brutal moments on film that I've witnessed in some time. That being said this film is a movie that will stick with you in more ways than one. On a visceral level it will twist your insides. On an emotional level you'll wonder how you would react in the same situation. And on a film watching level you will see a movie that holds many lyrical moments visually one minute and gut wrenching moments (literally) the next.If you've seen the movie OLDBOY (which also starred Min-Sik Choi) then you'll know the type of film to expect. It may not be for everyone but if you're willing to take a chance you'll finish by seeing a well made movie that doesn't treat a serial killer as a jokester ala Freddy Kreuger, but treats him as the terrifying killer that he truly is. This is a film that treats horror as horror and not a joke. And it stays with you even after it ends.",4,A TRULY DISTURBING REVENGE FILM,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,4310,"['are', 'movies', 'watch', 'be', 'entertained', 'are', 'movies', 'watch', 'experience', 'piece', 'art', 'then', 'are', 'movies', 'combine', 'two', 'ideas', 'come', 'out', 'something', 'altogether', 'different', 'movie', 'level', 'yet', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'be', 'considered', 'art', 'SAW', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'one', 'such', 'film', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'picture', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'final', 'credits.The', 'film', 'winter', 'where', 'young', 'woman', 'car', 'flat', 'speaking', 'boyfriend', 'secret', 'agent', 'offered', 'assistance', 'bus', 'driver', 'Once', 'up', 'bus', 'driver', 'viciously', 'breaking', 'out', 'windows', 'car', 'clubbing', 'submission', 'hammer', 'find', 'secluded', 'location', 'where', 'kidnapper', 'systematically', 'tortures', 'even', 'not', 'just', 'life', 'unborn', 'child.The', 'victim', 'boyfriend', 'Kim', 'Soo-hyeon', 'Byung-hung', 'Lee', 'distraught', 'murder', 'Contacting', 'father', 'ex-police', 'detective', 'given', 'several', 'leads', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'targeting', 'one', 'revenge', 'first', 'two', 'most', 'brutal', 'fashion', 'realizing', 'third', 'guilty', 'party', 'Tracking', 'down', 'easy', 'What', 'afterwards', 'not.Kim', 'finds', 'Kyung-chul', 'Min-Sik', 'Choi', 'nearly', 'beats', 'death', 'thirst', 'revenge', 'would', 'be', 'short', 'lived', 'killed', 'monster', 'Instead', 'live', 'knowledge', ""n't"", 'over', 'Kim', 'hunter', 'thrilling', 'hunt', 'track', 'down', 'Kyung', 'Kyung', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'almost', 'racking', 'up', 'several', 'more', 'victims', 'Kim', 'always', 'last', 'minute', 'more', 'physical', 'damage', 'Kyung.Readers', 'may', 'recall', ""'ve"", 'found', 'what', 'now', 'called', 'torture', 'porn', 'be', 'pretty', 'distasteful', 'especially', 'film', 'HOSTEL', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'rival', 'HOSTEL', 'sheer', 'power', 'filmed', 'torture', 'difference', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'squabble', 'over', 'HOSTEL', 'witnessed', 'movie', 'voyeurs', 'had', 'chance', 'become', 'part', 'action', 'pay', 'torture', 'people', 'more', 'motivation', 'so', 'called', 'thrill', 'film', 'witness', 'man', 'memory', 'tortured', 'not', 'being', 'there', 'save', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'man', 'who', 'seeking', 'out', 'vengeance.I', 'found', 'watching', 'thinking', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'given', 'same', 'circumstances', 'Would', 'want', 'find', 'vengeance', 'own', 'had', 'skill', 'set', 'character', 'Kim', 'capabilities', 'fighting', 'surveillance', 'techniques', 'would', 'want', 'take', 'own', 'pound', 'flesh', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'caused', 'such', 'pain', 'never', 'did', 'find', 'answer', 'questions', 'just', 'possibility', 'would.The', 'film', 'bloody', 'encounters', 'way', 'start', 'finish', 'even', 'stop', 'Kyung', 'home', 'invasion', 'friend', 'just', 'done', 'friend', 'who', 'cannibalism', 'middle', 'eating', 'one', 'victims', 'encounters', 'Kyung', 'Kim', 'Kim', 'threshold', 'finally', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'click', 'witnessing', 'Kim', 'perhaps', 'turn', 'same', 'monster', 'search', 'revenge', 'perhaps', 'not', 'finally', 'doing', 'so', 'interest.A', 'word', 'warning', 'film', 'not', 'weak', 'heart', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'offended', 'upset', 'witnessing', 'most', 'brutal', 'moments', 'film', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'time', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'movie', 'will', 'stick', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'visceral', 'level', 'will', 'twist', 'insides', 'emotional', 'level', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'same', 'situation', 'film', 'watching', 'level', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'many', 'lyrical', 'moments', 'visually', 'one', 'minute', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'moments', 'literally', 'next.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'OLDBOY', 'also', 'starred', 'Min-Sik', 'Choi', 'then', ""'ll"", 'know', 'type', 'film', 'expect', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'willing', 'take', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'finish', 'seeing', 'well', 'made', 'movie', ""n't"", 'treat', 'serial', 'killer', 'jokester', 'ala', 'Freddy', 'Kreuger', 'terrifying', 'killer', 'truly', 'film', 'horror', 'horror', 'not', 'joke', 'even']",N/A

I cant remember how many times someone got their head bashed in with a metal rod, wrench, pipe, hammer, dumbell, only to wake up a few minutes later, or wake up in the hospital. pfft.You cant split someone's jaw by wrenching it open with your bare hands. The force created by the leverage system that is your double hinged temporo-mandibular joints and the masseter muscles that work it are infinitely stronger than anything a super human could overcome with his fingers and elbow grease.

Let the Right One In, Timecrimes, Black Death, Hobo with a Shotgun, etc.; most of which have ranged from original to flat out brilliant.  I Saw the Devil winds up being both, as well as being a shockingly brutal portrait of the perils of seeking revenge.  Byung-hun Lee (better known to American audiences as Storm Shadow from the G.I. Joe movie) stars as a Korean secret agent who proceeds to administer repeated rounds of brutal revenge against the psychotic murderer (Min-sik Choi from Oldboy) of his fianc&eacute;e.  Implanting him with a tracking device and following him around delivering some flat out brutal punishment, it isn't long before our hero learns that not only has he underestimated his opponent, but that he himself is headed down a very dark road.  I Saw the Devil is shocking, graphic, and incredibly gripping from beginning to end.  Even though it clocks in at just under two and a half hours, it doesn't feel that long, and director Kim Ji-woon manages to deliver the shocks and some surprisingly emotional moments that shift between being slow-paced and practically unrelenting.

The two main characters learn about the devil in themselves by looking at one another.Kyung-Chul (Min-sik Choi) murders women. Resilient and wily, he is also so insane that he is almost hapless in his understanding of the world. One winter's night, he butchers Joo-Yeon (San-Ha Oh), a young woman who is pregnant by her fiance Kim Soo-hyeon (Byung-hun Lee). Joo-Yeon's detective father feels guilty for not being able to protect his own daughter, but he tries to be thankful for at least finding her dismembered body. He and his other daughter find space in their grief to worry about Soo-hyeon.A skilled special agent, Soo-hyeon takes it upon himself to find the killer. We follow both Soo-hyeon and Kyung-Chul as the former brutalizes suspects and the latter prowls for more victims. When Soo-hyeon finds Kyung-Chul, he abuses him to near death before pulling back and leaving him money. With the help of an implanted tracking device and microphone, Soo-hyeon later finds Kyung-Chul so he can repeat the torture.Kyung-Chul mentions his strange stalker to an equally mad friend, who points out that his pursuer is enjoying the hunt in the same way they do. Kyung-Chul contemplates this and begins to enjoy his and Soo-hyeon's symbiotic relationship. Soo-hyeon's sister-in-law tells him that there is no meaning in taking revenge on a crazy man. Soo-hyeon claims there is, and the audience wonders when he will deem the punishment complete.Touches of ironic humor are sprinkled throughout the film. The deranged killer calls others ""crazy retards"" or ""psychos."" One scene shows his reluctance to get into a taxi after he has lured so many women into his vehicle.For those who don't love gore, this film is nauseatingly violent. The protagonist's brutality is shown more graphically than the criminals'. Due to excessive blood-letting and lingering shots on defenseless women, the message that retribution calls forth an unwelcome monster is difficult to take seriously. However, the film's final minutes are chilling. The grisly action pauses long enough for us to witness what is within the two men. I Saw the Devil's harrowing conclusion powerfully examines the pointlessness of sadism.",4,Chilling,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,2257,"['Ji-woon', 'Kim', 'aptly', 'titled', 'vengeance', 'tale', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'learn', 'devil', 'looking', 'one', 'another.Kyung-Chul', 'Min-sik', 'Choi', 'murders', 'women', 'Resilient', 'wily', 'also', 'so', 'insane', 'almost', 'hapless', 'understanding', 'world', 'One', 'winter', 'night', 'Joo-Yeon', 'San-Ha', 'Oh', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'pregnant', 'fiance', 'Kim', 'Soo-hyeon', 'Byung-hun', 'Lee', 'Joo-Yeon', 'detective', 'father', 'feels', 'guilty', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'protect', 'own', 'daughter', 'be', 'thankful', 'least', 'finding', 'dismembered', 'body', 'other', 'daughter', 'find', 'space', 'grief', 'worry', 'Soo-hyeon.A', 'skilled', 'special', 'agent', 'Soo-hyeon', 'find', 'killer', 'follow', 'Soo-hyeon', 'Kyung-Chul', 'former', 'brutalizes', 'suspects', 'latter', 'prowls', 'more', 'victims', 'When', 'Soo-hyeon', 'finds', 'Kyung-Chul', 'near', 'death', 'pulling', 'back', 'leaving', 'money', 'help', 'implanted', 'tracking', 'device', 'microphone', 'Soo-hyeon', 'later', 'Kyung-Chul', 'can', 'repeat', 'torture.Kyung-Chul', 'mentions', 'strange', 'stalker', 'equally', 'mad', 'friend', 'who', 'out', 'pursuer', 'enjoying', 'hunt', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'Kyung-Chul', 'contemplates', 'enjoy', 'Soo-hyeon', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'Soo-hyeon', 'sister-in-law', 'meaning', 'taking', 'revenge', 'crazy', 'man', 'Soo-hyeon', 'claims', 'audience', 'wonders', 'when', 'will', 'deem', 'punishment', 'complete.Touches', 'ironic', 'humor', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'film', 'deranged', 'killer', 'others', 'crazy', 'retards', 'psychos', 'One', 'scene', 'reluctance', 'get', 'taxi', 'lured', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'vehicle.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'gore', 'film', 'nauseatingly', 'violent', 'protagonist', 'brutality', 'shown', 'more', 'graphically', 'criminals', 'Due', 'excessive', 'blood-letting', 'lingering', 'shots', 'defenseless', 'women', 'message', 'retribution', 'forth', 'unwelcome', 'monster', 'difficult', 'take', 'seriously', 'However', 'film', 'final', 'minutes', 'are', 'chilling', 'grisly', 'action', 'pauses', 'long', 'enough', 'witness', 'what', 'two', 'men', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'harrowing', 'conclusion', 'powerfully', 'pointlessness', 'sadism']",N/A

1423253,AWOROFNE3S4W3,B004P2VQXE,Phillip Frangules,"[0, 2]","I had high expectations for 'I Saw the Devil'. Kim Ji-woon had previously directed 'A Tale of Two Sisters' which is still one of my favorite films. I was also excited to see Oldboy's Choi Min-sik in a villainous role. In addition to that, the film had been hailed by critics as worthy successor to Park Chan-wook's Oldboy and had garnered quite a bit of controversy in that it was too violent for South Korea (Kim was forced to edit out some grisly scenes for his home release; rest assured that the American release is uncut). In retrospect, perhaps I expected too much of it but I couldn't help walking out a bit disappointed.Right off the bat, Kim Ji-woon does a great job directing the film. The film wouldn't be nearly as effective as it is if it was someone else behind the camera. There's a lot of stunning action sequences here that will leave you breathless; one of the highlights is the taxi cab scene in which the camera spins around frenetically as Choi Min-sik stabs the driver and the passenger.Performance-wise, Choi Min-sik predictably steals the show. He plays a complete scumbag in every sense of the word yet you can't take his eyes off him. It's a credit to his abilities as an actor in that not once did I see him as his character from 'Oldboy'. Lee Byung-hun does equally well with his role but I wasn't as emotionally affected with his performance given the stoic nature of his character.Story-wise the film is a bit weak. I got *why* the protagonist would let the killer go only to find him again just so he could prolong the torture, so that wasn't an issue. After a while, though, it just gets a little repetitive. I wouldn't say I was bored but I did wish that the film would get on with it. I only really started gaining an interest in the film once Choi Min-sik's character realizes what it is going on and attempts to turn the tables on his pursuer, but that happens roughly 3/4 into the film. Had this occurred at the halfway point the film would have been considerably stronger in my opinion. When all is said and done, the plot is a fairly standard take on the revenge genre with few surprises.The film falls short especially when you compare it to the first two films in Park Chan-wook's 'Vengeance Trilogy'. 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance' and 'Oldboy' were far more than simple revenge fare. They turned your expectations upside down and didn't play by the conventions of the genre. 'I Saw the Devil' in comparison is fairly predictable from start to finish. When I finished watching those films, or Kim Ji-woon's 'A Tale of Two Sisters' for that matter, I knew that I had watched something special. Conversely, I felt 'I Saw the Devil' was a well-made film but at the end of the day it was just that. I really don't see myself revisiting in the future for that matter.Should you see this film? It's definitely worth seeing at least once and if you're a fan of Asian cinema you should check it out if only for the talent involved. That being said, if you're just starting to get into Asian cinema there are much better films that should be explored first.",3,Well-made but falls short of its brethren,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,3088,"['had', 'high', 'expectations', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'Kim', 'Ji-woon', 'had', 'previously', 'directed', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'was', 'also', 'excited', 'see', 'Oldboy', 'Choi', 'Min-sik', 'villainous', 'role', 'addition', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'hailed', 'critics', 'worthy', 'successor', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'Oldboy', 'had', 'garnered', 'quite', 'bit', 'controversy', 'was', 'too', 'violent', 'South', 'Korea', 'Kim', 'was', 'forced', 'edit', 'out', 'grisly', 'scenes', 'home', 'release', 'rest', 'assured', 'American', 'release', 'uncut', 'retrospect', 'perhaps', 'expected', 'too', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'walking', 'out', 'bit', 'disappointed.Right', 'bat', 'Kim', 'Ji-woon', 'great', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'was', 'someone', 'else', 'camera', 'lot', 'stunning', 'action', 'sequences', 'here', 'will', 'leave', 'breathless', 'one', 'highlights', 'taxi', 'cab', 'scene', 'camera', 'around', 'frenetically', 'Choi', 'Min-sik', 'stabs', 'driver', 'passenger.Performance-wise', 'Choi', 'Min-sik', 'predictably', 'show', 'complete', 'scumbag', 'sense', 'word', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'credit', 'abilities', 'actor', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'see', 'character', ""'Oldboy"", 'Lee', 'Byung-hun', 'equally', 'well', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'affected', 'performance', 'given', 'stoic', 'nature', 'character.Story-wise', 'film', 'bit', 'weak', 'got', '*why*', 'protagonist', 'would', 'let', 'killer', 'go', 'only', 'find', 'again', 'just', 'could', 'prolong', 'torture', 'was', ""n't"", 'issue', 'while', 'just', 'little', 'repetitive', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'bored', 'did', 'wish', 'film', 'would', 'get', 'only', 'really', 'started', 'gaining', 'interest', 'film', 'once', 'Choi', 'Min-sik', 'character', 'what', 'going', 'attempts', 'turn', 'tables', 'pursuer', 'roughly', '3/4', 'film', 'Had', 'occurred', 'halfway', 'point', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considerably', 'stronger', 'opinion', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'plot', 'fairly', 'standard', 'take', 'revenge', 'genre', 'few', 'surprises.The', 'film', 'short', 'especially', 'when', 'compare', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', ""'Vengeance"", 'Trilogy', ""'Sympathy"", 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'simple', 'revenge', 'fare', 'turned', 'expectations', 'upside', 'down', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'conventions', 'genre', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'comparison', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'start', 'finish', 'When', 'finished', 'watching', 'films', 'Kim', 'Ji-woon', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'matter', 'knew', 'had', 'watched', 'something', 'special', 'Conversely', 'felt', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'was', 'well-made', 'film', 'end', 'day', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'revisiting', 'future', 'matter.Should', 'see', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'only', 'talent', 'involved', 'being', 'said', ""'re"", 'just', 'starting', 'get', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'explored', 'first']",N/A

1423255,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004P2VQXE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","&lt;strong>I Saw the Devil&lt;/strong> (Jee-woon Kim, 2010)Violence for violence's sake is relatively common in movies these days, but it's been a while (five years, to be precise) since I've trekked to the theater and seen a film that embraces the concept on the big screen. When you're used to your 32"" TV screen (or substantially smaller computer monitor) as a delivery vehicle for films, you sometimes forget how much more vast everything seems in glorious 35mm, with surround-sound and all that sort of thing. Thus, &lt;em>I Saw the Devil&lt;/em> came as a bit of a shock to me; I probably flinched more times during this film than I have during... well, I can't remember flinching this many times at &lt;em>any&lt;/em> movie, ever, though I rush to add this is solely as a result of the big-screen treatment I got (I will warn you, folks, there's one scene--and it's early in the film--that will make almost any male watching flinch). It is an unrestrained orgy of violence, this movie is, and Kim revels in every spatter of blood, every vicious act. Because of that, of course, everything I say below should have an understood ""if you like that sort of thing"" tacked onto it. Now, don't get me wrong, &lt;em>I Saw the Devil&lt;/em> is not your tired old torture porn flick. Instead, this is another tried old subgenre--the revenge thriller--given a retread. I was put in mind more than once of &lt;em>Death Wish&lt;/em> while watching this. Unfortunately, that is to &lt;em>I Saw the Devil&lt;/em>'s detriment, for reasons we'll go into presently.Plot: Soo-hyeon Kim (&lt;em>J.S.A.&lt;/em>'s Byung-Hun Lee) is a Secret Service agent in South Korea. He's working on his fiancee's birthday...again. (Though how you can reconcile that ""again"" with his boss' later comment that they only got engaged a month before the movie begins I haven't yet figured out.) She, returning from her monthly trip to a country orphanage, is stuck at a roadside rest stop with a flat tire. She's called a tow truck, but a helpful citizen, Kyung-chul Jang (&lt;em>Oldboy&lt;/em>'s Min-sik Choi, returning from a brief retirement), stops and offers to take a look at it. As we suspect from the get-go, there is a bit more to Kyung-chul's attentions than helpfulness; in short, by the end of the first sequence, the fiancee is quite dead, Soo-hyeon and her family have found out about it, and Soo-hyeon has vowed revenge. After a very quick bout of detection, Soo-hyeon discovers the identity of the killer, and thanks to a bit of technology, begins a brutal cat-and-mouse game with him.My biggest problem may have to do with expectations set up by promo material and reviews, all of which feature Soo-hyeon's ""descent"" into the animal nature shared by Kyung-chul. This is, to be succinct, rubbish. There is no descent; there is, if anything, a switch in Soo-hyeon's mind, and from the very first acts he undertakes in his quest for revenge, he is already well into the bestial world. I don't think he gets any more so as he goes along; he's already become the panther. Which makes the cat-and-mouse game no less fun, but be aware that you're not going to get the sort of character development one gets in the better revenge dramas; this is more &lt;em>Avenging Angel&lt;/em> than it is &lt;em>Death Wish&lt;/em> in that regard, and the movie suffers for it.The other problem I had with the movie, which may not actually be a problem (the jury's still out on that), is the ending. Let's face it, this is a movie with all the subtlety and grace of a scalpel to the Achilles tendon. Blood flies, flows, and spurts, bodies are hacked up, and a handful of reviews have already dissected the excellent scene right in the middle of the film with the double-murder in the car and its gorgeous camerawork. (I should mention, however, that those critics who are talking about how incredibly violent it is have some gaps in their education in Asian cinema; T. F. Mous and Hideshi Hino were doing more extreme stuff a quarter-century ago and longer.) Why, all the sudden, did Kim feel the need to tack on an ambiguous ending? Not in what happens, mind you, but in the eventual fate of the surviving main character (don't want to spoil that for you). Both of these characters are supposed to have changed throughout the movie, and again I am basing this premise on the promotional materials and other reviews. And yet, we see no evidence of such a change. I wish I could point out the concrete evidence that this is the case, but that would constitute THE major spoiler for this movie. Suffice to say that if what I think was supposed to be the big evidence of the change really was what I thought it was, Kim shoots himself in the foot early in the film by showing the character in the same basic frame of mind.On the other hand, maybe Kim's point is that said character &lt;em>didn't&lt;/em> change, and all the promo material was designed to mislead? (What shallow creatures we critics are, if so, taking it all at face value.) That would lend some interesting weight to a certain piece of the climactic confrontation, and the more I mull this idea over, the more I think ""hey, guys, we got duped, and this is actually a better movie than it wants us to believe it is."" Or maybe I'm just being an apologist, I don't know. Either way, I can tell you that it's a great bloody time if you don't think about it too much, and the more I think about it, the more I think it's actually great fun if you DO think about it too much, which makes it a winner either way. I do wish we'd gotten a bit more character development, and I feel obligated to mention that I've read a couple of reviews that claim the film is too long at just over 140 minutes; I, on the other hand, found it wonderfully-paced, and was amazed when I walked out of the theater to find it at least an hour later than I thought it would be. *** 1/2",4,...and he danced for me.,1307664000,"06 10,

For those that can stand it though, this film offers a deep and moving meditation on revenge that transcends the shocking violence it contains.The initial story is pretty straightforward. The introductory scene involves a woman who is stranded with a flat tire, and is then confronted and killed by a murderous passerby. Things get interesting when the husband of the killed woman sets off to exact revenge on the killer in his own unique way. All I will say is that things get very messy...and very interesting.The film aims to show the treacherous road that must be travelled when seeking revenge. It succeeds because it shows how someone consumed with anger and vengeance, can become as evil as the very thing they are opposing.If I had to compare this film for recommendation purposes...I'd say if you saw Old Boy and enjoyed it, you'll probably like this.

The film begins with a young women broken down by the side of the road on a cold winters night. To pass time waiting for the tow-truck, she nervously talks on the phone to her secret agent fiance(Byrung-hun lee). Tragedy strikes when she is brutally killed by a psychopath(Min-sik Choi) shortly after her phone call. Staggered by grief and consumed with hate, the agent sets off to find his wife's killer but the path he sets out on will change him and the ones he loves forever.""I Saw The Devil"" is a brilliant and highly stylized revenge tale that is soaked in blood. I've seen my fair share of gory films but I found myself squirming in my seat constantly while watching. Both Byrung-hun and Min-sik put in excellent performances. Byrung-hun's agent doesn't talk much but you can see the hatred and grief brewing inside of him like a tempest. Min-sik's killer is definitely the most grotesque and revolting depiction of a psycho killer I've seen put to film. He's remorseless, sadistic and possesses no redeemable qualities what so ever.Kim Ji-woon likes to slowly build up tension and then have his film explode with emotion and ultra violence. Something he does to dramatic effect. The violence gets so out of hand that it almost becomes comical but not so much that it ruins the film's credibility . ""I Saw The Devil"" is one of the best films I've seen this year. I found myself emotionally invested in Byrung-hun's quest for revenge and couldn't help being corrupted by it.

1423266,A96JD9312DHWC,B004P2VQXE,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[0, 0]","A snowy day and car trouble, young lovers talking on the phone waiting for a tow truck to arrive; nothing seemingly wrong in the world. A woman inside the car talking, a man on the other side trying to find a place to proclaim his love by singing little pieces especially for her. Then a man arrives and offers help she refuses, but help is not the thing he wants to give. This is the way things start, and the emotions that come from it seem like the ones that you would expect - and first. The thing is that there is something more there, little pieces amongst the broken life - or lives - as the movie continues to play out, showing the viewing audience that there is more to life than an emotion that burns like the brightest candle in the sky.""Revenge is only for movies."" It seems a power thing, looking back now.What we have here, on some levels, is a revenge tale. From the beginning you can see where the movie is going with that, and the movie is powerful in its portrayal of what revenge actually means. I like the fact that the movie is graphic, thinking that movies should be in a lot of cases, because life isn't something that people should forget. When a person dies there is suffering, and that light going out is grasped at by so many. The struggling, the horror, the motion, the blood; it is all proof that this commodity is something we cherish. Leaving that out makes it almost dismissive, lending negligible to the notion that not showing something somehow erases the fact that a person is still dead. So, the ultra-violence works for me.On another level, the violence saw something about the characters. When we see the person doing this, he sometimes strikes you as a person that you want to love to hate. His friends are monsters as well, and the world he has around him is something out of a nightmare. To get thta across you develop a world where our lead is thrust into it, and the level he goes to is something shocking. As he is told, don't become a monster to fight a monster. Still, judging from the one breakdown he really has, the revenge is only an application that holds him together like some sort of emotive glue.The landscape of the movie, from the physical to the emotional, can be gritty or beautiful or moving at times. I noticed the darkness in places that were both human and elemental, and I saw some blank features in both the features of man and mountain alike. I actually liked the fact that our main character seemed that way at first, allowing him to seem like a mechanical beast thriving on hurting someone. You can see the why later and see what he loves later, but he conceals it and needs to hide it all. The other side of the spectrum, the monster of a man, is equally impressive on display. From the way he is to the way he feels when you see him, you know the thing. You loathe it and you want it to suffer, but the game it is involved in seems suited to it. I personally enjoyed that.As far as story, there are parts you know and there are turns you wont. It is lovely in that right when you look at it after the fact, knowing that it was surprising in ways and still driving along a old route. We all know the revenge film and we can imagine the gore that can come. what is interesting is sometimes not the how but the why or even the way items turn out of control Without the spinning, these worlds never seem to turn as suddenly.I loved the watch - it kept me on my seat and responding. I felt drawn in by the story, wanting what the character wanted in a way, understanding that plight. The idea hurt, why would it not, and that makes it connective. At the same time it said more on the matter, with some moments seemingly too dark or too deep and reminding us of the place this takes a person. All in all I thought it was 5/5 material, and it was rewatchable. Note that gore is way up there, and I cringed sometimes and don't normally do that. Being raised on horror sometimes takes the shock out of it, but this still had a feeling to it. note that and note the subtitles and you are set.

This movie doesn't shy away from any of the disgusting horrible things it brings up. It examines the concepts of good and evil people as well as the idea of when revenge turns someone good into the thing they are fighting. Amazing performances, Min-Sik Choi delivers a performance I'll never forget. This movie will push your boundaries and make you question when would you stop if you were taking revenge? Amazing in every way, acting, directing, art, style, dialogue, even sound quality, this movie is a must own for anyone who is looking to push themselves that extra mile into the darkness of the human heart.",5,"Absolutely amazing, revenge taken to an extreme",1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,675,"['First', 'revenge', 'film', 'Korean', 'revenge', 'film', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'disgusting', 'horrible', 'things', 'up', 'concepts', 'good', 'evil', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'idea', 'when', 'revenge', 'someone', 'good', 'thing', 'are', 'fighting', 'Amazing', 'performances', 'Min-Sik', 'Choi', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'movie', 'will', 'push', 'boundaries', 'make', 'question', 'when', 'would', 'stop', 'were', 'taking', 'revenge', 'Amazing', 'way', 'acting', 'directing', 'art', 'style', 'dialogue', 'even', 'sound', 'quality', 'movie', 'must', 'own', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'push', 'extra', 'mile', 'darkness', 'human', 'heart']",N/A

It has some gore but a fair amount of off camera violence, that I didn't like. I hate it when they pull the punch. So if your looking for a gore fest this is kinda a let down. Also the ending was stolen from another film.

1423271,A2O0LIVTTFU75I,B004P2VQXE,W Mianecke,"[1, 2]","This is a tough call for me. I'm a big fan of the director and the two lead actors. However when this was over I was asking myself ""Did this need to be made? Did this tale REALLY need to be told?"" Serial killer cat and mouse vengeance has been done to death. In some ways this is SE7EN (or however you spell that movie's title)  without the  thematic motive for the killer. It 's a shame to see such amazing cinematography and editing applied to such a tired genre effort. This brings little if anything new to the genre. The structure of the story leaves some characters and developments as little more than convenient plot advancers. We've seen all this before and the director's previous efforts have displayed a far more nuanced approach to leading the viewer to decide how far is too far to go were one to lose a loved one to violent crime. Ironically this film has some of the most expertly staged gore effects and sequences I've ever seen. And the violence isn' t glamorized by any means. However the portrayal of the killer is excessively broad and cartoonish and erratic- with no clear indication of this being intentional. All in all- I felt like I'd wasted my time. It just didn't become more than the sum of its parts and it suffered from a off-track 3rd ""act"". An interesting but unsatisfying misfire from a maestro. And did we REALLY need that looking -for-the-microphone/gps sequence?
