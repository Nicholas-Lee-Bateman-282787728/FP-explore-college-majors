1258678,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B002AMVED8,A. Estes,"[3, 4]","Showtime's hit series ""Weeds"" sure has changed since its inception in 2005. Created by Jenji Kohan, the series originally followed a widowed mother, Nancy (Mary Louise Parker), whom in an effort to support herself and her children, is thrust into the drug-selling business. Making money off of selling pot was easy at first, but it proved to be a dangerous game, with Nancy inadvertantly burning all of her bridges and connections to the past and fleeing to the border of Mexico, always with somebody on her tail.Season Five of the show strays even farther from its roots, but unlike the underwhelming fourth season, this one manages to keep in the tradition of being as addictive as an actual drug, with each episode leaving you laughing and on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what they come up with next. Everyone's favorite pot-peddling soccer mom is now pregnant, and takes her relationship with a powerful and dangerous Mexican politician to the next level. Meanwhile, her children are put in danger on more than one occasion while Uncle Andy (the always entertaining and reliable Justin Kirk) falls in love with a doctor, played by Alanis Morissette, who challenges him to finally grow up. Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) and Doug (Kevin Nealon) pop up in heavy doses to deliver the seasons biggest laughs, however, and prove that ""Weeds"" is at its finest when it focuses on humor over melodrama.Many will malign this season for the same reason they condemned Season Four, but alas, if you can get past the fact that this isn't the same show it was when it first aired, you're likely in for a good show. Sure, Nancy's not selling pot, but in essence, she is still ""in the weeds"" and Season Five is as entertaining and engaging as the show has ever been. Yes, it has a tendency to feel like a Spanish soap opera at times, but once you are done with the season's thirteen episodes, you'll be dying to see where Season Six goes. ""Weeds"" sure has changed a lot, but with an open mind and a sense of humor, it's still worth the -- ahem -- green.",4,The Grass is Greener in Season Five.,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,2046,"['Showtime', 'hit', 'series', 'Weeds', 'sure', 'changed', 'inception', '2005', 'Created', 'Jenji', 'Kohan', 'series', 'originally', 'followed', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Nancy', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'whom', 'effort', 'support', 'children', 'thrust', 'drug-selling', 'business', 'Making', 'money', 'selling', 'pot', 'was', 'easy', 'first', 'proved', 'be', 'dangerous', 'game', 'Nancy', 'inadvertantly', 'burning', 'bridges', 'connections', 'past', 'fleeing', 'border', 'Mexico', 'always', 'somebody', 'tail.Season', 'Five', 'show', 'even', 'farther', 'roots', 'underwhelming', 'fourth', 'season', 'one', 'keep', 'tradition', 'being', 'as', 'addictive', 'actual', 'drug', 'episode', 'leaving', 'laughing', 'edge', 'seat', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'come', 'up', 'next', 'Everyone', 'favorite', 'pot-peddling', 'soccer', 'mom', 'now', 'pregnant', 'relationship', 'powerful', 'dangerous', 'Mexican', 'politician', 'next', 'level', 'Meanwhile', 'children', 'are', 'put', 'danger', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'Uncle', 'Andy', 'always', 'entertaining', 'reliable', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'love', 'doctor', 'played', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'who', 'finally', 'grow', 'up', 'Celia', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'Doug', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'pop', 'up', 'heavy', 'doses', 'deliver', 'seasons', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'however', 'prove', 'Weeds', 'finest', 'when', 'humor', 'melodrama.Many', 'will', 'malign', 'season', 'same', 'reason', 'condemned', 'Season', 'Four', 'alas', 'can', 'get', 'fact', ""n't"", 'same', 'show', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'aired', ""'re"", 'likely', 'good', 'show', 'Sure', 'Nancy', 'not', 'selling', 'pot', 'essence', 'still', 'weeds', 'Season', 'Five', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'show', 'ever', 'been', 'Yes', 'tendency', 'feel', 'Spanish', 'soap', 'opera', 'times', 'once', 'are', 'done', 'season', 'thirteen', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dying', 'see', 'where', 'Season', 'Six', 'Weeds', 'sure', 'changed', 'lot', 'open', 'mind', 'sense', 'humor', 'still', 'worth', 'ahem', 'green']",N/A

The characters get more and more unwatchable with each new season..to the point of my actually wanting something bad to happen to all of them..and for me to like a series there has to be characters that I root for. I should say that while this episode was bad, Season 6 was even worse..so bad that I couldn't even watch all of it.

1258680,A391YPR0NFTCLK,B002AMVED8,Brian,"[40, 49]","Showtime's series Weeds is one of the best shows on television. Each season is consistently strong- with engaging, inventive stories, complex charecters and wonderful dark comedy. Mary-Louise Parker is absolutely phenomenal as Nancy Botwin, one of the most complex and uncompromising charecters to ever appear on television. Parker is backed by an always reliable supporting cast who bring humor and heart to the at times, very dark proceedings. Weeds' Fifth Season is the slowest one but that does not mean it's bad. It is the most character driven season, we get to see the true colors of these charecters and what they really want, and at times, its not pretty. Nancy continues her downward spiral and drags her youngest son Shane down with her. Silas becomes the emotional center of this extremely dysfunctional family, and at 18 has become the real father figure. Andy strives to get out of Nancy's grasp and start his own life while Celia tries her hardest to be a different person and at times actually tries to BE Nancy. This season is all about coming to terms with the inevitable and face the consequences. There is plenty here to reward long time fans of the show and viewers interested in the psychological make-up of these crazy charecters. The season finale promises to set up more of the themes established in this season. I cant wait to see what happens next. Weeds is still my personal favorite show on TV, layered, funny, deep and always surprising.This Season Five DVD set includes the episodes:- Wonderful, Wonderful- Machetes Up Top- Su-Su-Sucio- Super Lucky Happy- Van Nuys- A Modest Proposal- Where the Sidewalk Ends- A Distinctive Horn- Suck 'n' Spit- Perro Insano- Ducks and Tigers- Glue- All About My Mom",5,Yet Another High Quality Season,1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,1730,"['Showtime', 'series', 'Weeds', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'season', 'consistently', 'strong-', 'engaging', 'inventive', 'stories', 'complex', 'charecters', 'wonderful', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'uncompromising', 'charecters', 'ever', 'appear', 'television', 'Parker', 'backed', 'always', 'reliable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', 'bring', 'humor', 'heart', 'times', 'very', 'dark', 'proceedings', 'Weeds', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'slowest', 'one', 'not', 'mean', 'bad', 'most', 'character', 'driven', 'season', 'get', 'see', 'true', 'colors', 'charecters', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'times', 'not', 'pretty', 'Nancy', 'downward', 'spiral', 'youngest', 'son', 'Shane', 'down', 'Silas', 'emotional', 'center', 'extremely', 'dysfunctional', 'family', '18', 'become', 'real', 'father', 'figure', 'Andy', 'get', 'Nancy', 'grasp', 'start', 'own', 'life', 'Celia', 'hardest', 'be', 'different', 'person', 'times', 'actually', 'BE', 'Nancy', 'season', 'coming', 'terms', 'inevitable', 'face', 'consequences', 'plenty', 'here', 'reward', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'show', 'viewers', 'interested', 'psychological', 'make-up', 'crazy', 'charecters', 'season', 'finale', 'promises', 'set', 'up', 'more', 'themes', 'established', 'season', 'cant', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'Weeds', 'still', 'personal', 'favorite', 'show', 'TV', 'layered', 'funny', 'deep', 'always', 'surprising.This', 'Season', 'Five', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'Wonderful', 'Wonderful-', 'Machetes', 'Up', 'Top-', 'Su-Su-Sucio-', 'Super', 'Lucky', 'Happy-', 'Van', 'Nuys-', 'A', 'Modest', 'Proposal-', 'Where', 'Sidewalk', 'Ends-', 'A', 'Distinctive', 'Horn-', 'Suck', 'n', 'Spit-', 'Perro', 'Insano-', 'Ducks', 'Tigers-', 'Glue-', 'All', 'My', 'Mom']",N/A

1258684,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B002AMVED8,Douglas King,"[6, 9]","When ""Weeds"" moved from California suburbia to a Mexican border town in season 4, I was hoping that it would give the show the creative shot in the arm it needed. For a while, it seemed to work, and season 4 ended on an intense and serious note, with Nancy dealing with the ramifications of ratting out the drug tunnel that was also shipping girls into slavery.Season 5, sadly, was hopelessly uneven. The actors on the show are excellent (Especially Mary Louise Parker and Justin Kirk), but the writers have them all wandering around aimlessly, going from one hapless mess to another. The season started with Nancy in peril as her drug kingpin/mayor boyfriend tried to decide whether or not to kill her for her betrayal. Instead, upon verifying that Nancy is indeed pregnant with his son, he marries her and pledges love and devotion. Andy decides he's in love with Nancy and wants to be the father figure her children desperately need, but after Nancy jilts him he ends up in love with Nancy's gynecologist. Elizabeth Perkins is a wonderful actress, but her Celia character, as well as the handful of other Agrestic refugees, have little reason to be on the show anymore. The only character who develops in an interesting direction is Shane. His character has always been strange and offbeat, but it appears that finally,after years of living in chaos and moral deprivity thanks to his Mom, he's now become completely psychotic. The cliffhanger he provides by casually murdering Nancy's archnemesis is one of the best things in the season.The season does get a little help from its co-stars. Jennifer Jason Leigh was a terrific breath of fresh air as Nancy's sister. I wish they had extended her storyline and given her more to do. And Alanis Morisette gave a surprisingly charming performance as Nancy's doctor and Andy's love interest.Here's hoping that next season features better storylines and character development.",3,Uneven,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,1922,"['When', 'Weeds', 'moved', 'California', 'suburbia', 'Mexican', 'border', 'town', 'season', '4', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'give', 'show', 'creative', 'shot', 'arm', 'needed', 'while', 'seemed', 'work', 'season', '4', 'ended', 'intense', 'serious', 'note', 'Nancy', 'dealing', 'ramifications', 'ratting', 'out', 'drug', 'tunnel', 'was', 'also', 'shipping', 'girls', 'slavery.Season', '5', 'sadly', 'was', 'hopelessly', 'uneven', 'actors', 'show', 'are', 'excellent', 'Especially', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'writers', 'have', 'wandering', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'going', 'one', 'hapless', 'mess', 'season', 'started', 'Nancy', 'peril', 'drug', 'kingpin/mayor', 'boyfriend', 'tried', 'decide', 'not', 'kill', 'betrayal', 'Instead', 'verifying', 'Nancy', 'indeed', 'pregnant', 'son', 'pledges', 'love', 'devotion', 'Andy', 'love', 'Nancy', 'be', 'father', 'figure', 'children', 'desperately', 'need', 'Nancy', 'jilts', 'up', 'love', 'Nancy', 'gynecologist', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'Celia', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'handful', 'other', 'Agrestic', 'refugees', 'have', 'little', 'reason', 'be', 'show', 'anymore', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'interesting', 'direction', 'Shane', 'character', 'always', 'been', 'strange', 'offbeat', 'finally', 'years', 'living', 'chaos', 'moral', 'deprivity', 'thanks', 'Mom', 'now', 'become', 'completely', 'psychotic', 'cliffhanger', 'casually', 'murdering', 'Nancy', 'archnemesis', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'season.The', 'season', 'get', 'little', 'help', 'co-stars', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'was', 'terrific', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Nancy', 'sister', 'wish', 'had', 'extended', 'storyline', 'given', 'more', 'do', 'Alanis', 'Morisette', 'gave', 'surprisingly', 'charming', 'performance', 'Nancy', 'doctor', 'Andy', 'love', 'interest.Here', 'hoping', 'next', 'season', 'features', 'better', 'storylines', 'character', 'development']",N/A

I think the show is taking absurd to a new level with some of the ridiculous plot twists, and I also really don't like what's happened to some of my favorite characters.Season 5 picks up right where the last season left off, with Nancy (Mary Louise Parker) in Esteban's (Demi&aacute;n Bichir) office. Esteban was ready to kill Nancy for her betrayal, but her little bombshell caused him to reconsider. The season spins off in a dozen different directions, with Nancy trying to protect her family while dealing with Esteban's crazy demands. Meanwhile, Doug (Kevin Nealon) and Silas (Hunter Parrish) go into business together, which of course leads to disastrous results. Shane (Alexander Gould) becomes even more bitter about his life, Andy (Justin Kirk) continues to pine over Nancy (at least for a while), and Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) struggles to get back on her feet.The show makes a smart move mid-season and pulls a ""Desparate Housewives"" by fast-forwarding into the future (only by six months, not five years). This definitely picks up the pacing of the storylines, and the final few episodes of the season are among the best. There are definitely some funny scenes, but also some awful moments. (Nancy and Andy in the bathroom of the restaurant? Celia and her new ""love interest?"" EW!) I was disappointed with a lot of the characters this season. Nancy seemed to make even more stupid moves than usual, Andy was even more annoying (if that's possible), and Celia...oh my god, CELIA! She used to be my favorite character on the show, and I hated her all season!Best part of the season? Same as last season...Bichir's performance as Esteban.

Storylines that began were quickly stopped, characters changed personality, almost seemingly randomly, and then there was a giant time shift for no real reason.  I had a real hard time liking Nancy this season.  There's a moment in Season 5 where Andy very genuinely tells Nancy that she's at fault for everything that's happened to her, and asks how she could not know this.  I loved that moment as it defined my growing problem with the show.  While weeds started as a show with a mother who turned to selling drugs as a last resort to saving her family from financial ruin, she's morphed into more of a thrill seeker.  She prefers to be in danger, rather than run from it.  This season especially, she's had chances to escape from this situation, and live a normal life, but she doesn't, and now knowingly choose the wrong path.  Sure, television is based on characters in bad situations, but previously Nancy's problems always stemmed from an outside source.  Now she is the person making the bad decisions.  It makes her character, and the show, less interesting.The show did have some great and very funny moments, but I feel so many characters are left without a real story or purpose, which is why so many times stories just end so quickly, as they tried something that just didn't work, so they gave up.

Fans of the series have apparently embraced this season as one of the best, so I will stick with the BD review.The picture clarity is outstanding throughout, with plenty of testings for the darks, color variances and flesh tones. There was only one scene in one episode where I caught any falter (the night scene where Nancy thinks about running away with dufus, sitting on the bench in her recently discovered dead garden). The outdoor dance scene in the public square demonstrated a nice rainbow of color with no issues. The sound however was disappointing. A let down only because it is 7.1 DTS, but I counted five times in the whole season that it actually got used (the birds while Celia is in the rebel camp, the boys on their nature hike, and a few indistinct scenes), so it almost feels like a waste - always a huge fan of DTS though - especially 7 channels. The supplements are almost all forgettable, disc 1 can play the episodes only and you would not miss a thing, including:* History of Weed, 1:58 minutes (lodef). Corny animation boards covering the known history of the plant, boring.* Yes We Cannabis, 1:30 minutes (lodef). A Kevin Nealon campaign speech for Nancy Botwin?? Whatever.* Little Titles, 3:18 minutes (hidef). Reviews the intro artwork for each season 5 episode, brief narration for each that did not describe much.* Backstage with Kevin Nealon, 11:07 minutes (lodef). Handheld nightmare of motion sickness as he walks from stage to stage showing the catering, trailers and behind the scenes stuff...not worth it.* Relationships of Weeds, 12:15 minutes (hidef). The actors/creator get interviewed on their takes of where the dysfunctional relationships on Weeds are going and why. Not as insightful as I had hoped as they kept it where if you had not seen the season yet nothing shocking would be revealed.* Bloopers, 11:04 (hidef). Drags quite a bot, but you will get a couple laughs out of it (I think the scene with the elderly loan officer was the most sincere) the rest were uneventful.* University of Andy, 13 chapters totaling 33:58 minutes (lodef). These are the episodes you can access via the website. He does a classroom instruction of how to succeed at various ""important"" things in life (manscaping, surviving a wild animal attack, internet dating, etc.). Became real boring real fast - but I suppose fans of his might enjoy this.I love the series, but the overall BD product could not warrant a content/sound/picture 5-star rating (2/3 of supps in lodef, DTS unused, no BD Live and there is tons of material online for this show). Region A coded spread over two discs (7 episodes on disc 1 with several supps, 6 episodes on disc 2 with the rest).

You almost wish that Nancy Botwin would get killed off so that the show could drop all of the accumulated baggage of five seasons and start over fresh.Season Five is the ""Baby Season,"" where we watch Nancy Botwin struggle to have her new baby, support her family and keep herself alive all at the same time.  Unfortunately the show quickly devolves into a generic drama that could be found on any number of network television stations.  This season truly feels like the weed and drug trade are thrown in simply in order to keep the name of the show ""Weeds,"" and I believe it was the drug dynamic that made this show as interesting as it was in the first place. While Nancy is off playing Mrs. Mexican Mafia, Silas and Doug partner up in order to attempt a legal Medicinal Marijuana storefront while Celia (after escaping from her daughter's kidnapping plot) attempts to capture the same success that Nancy had in seasons 1 and 2 by becoming the neighborhood ""connection.""There are two bright spots in this season and they came out of left field for me: Shane and Dr. Audra Kitson (Alanis Morissette).  Andy is still Andy - fantasizing about Nancy, hoping to replace Judah, but never quite living up to her expectations. He attempts to have a new relationship with Nancy's ""on the side"" ObGyn played remarkably well by Alanis Morissette.  While you could pretty much cut and paste Andy's character from all the other seasons of Weeds, Morissette actually plays an interesting and quirky counterpart who attempts to make Andy ""grow up"" in order to have a real relationship with her.Shane meanwhile, becomes broken.  The poor kid has a busy season - he becomes a drug dealer, gets robbed by his teacher, befriends one of the Mexican thugs, gets a STD from his two ""girlfriends,"" and gets shot.  The last of the ""pure"" Botwins becomes truly corrupted and he relishes his new found freedom, unencumbered by morals.  Without dropping any spoilers, lets just say that Shane is the cause of the cliffhanger at the end of Season Five (and no, he's not dying because he got shot).The eye candy for this season for the women is brought to you by Silas and Esteban - unfortunately they don't add much more depth to their characters other than just sitting on the screen looking pretty.  Doug and the Hodes play their normal comedic interludes, not bringing much to the storyline, but not really slowing it down either; pure, unadulterated filler.All in all it was a pretty disappointing season.  If you're a die hard Weeds fan you won't be very impressed by season five.  If you're new to the Weeds show, watch seasons 1-3 instead.

Flash Mobs were once fun and weird but have become dull and tedious with repetition, corporate sponsorship and their renewed popularity in dull communities. Of course, that's a metaphor while everything else in this season is set to remind you of when the show was once fun. Andy is on the make. THe kids are freaky. Celia is as awesome as ever and Kevin Nealon gets some stuff to do. But mostly this show has the playing for time quality of a show that once had a purpose but fell away. They are even back in the suburbs - I think.The season starts out with several tight situations where we think that our heroine is in hot water. But finally when the baby is born, it settles into this domestic tedium that sinks with every moment that Esteban is on screen. I don't care about him. I don't care about his relationship with Nancy,. I don't care about the stupid baby or the henchmen. I would say that he's a drag on the show, but I'm not sure if there is much of a show to begin with. I wish that I couldn't believe that the writers pulled the ""She's going to get married - just kidding"" trick and there was some kind intrigue involving another woman who is either his campaign advisor or other mistress but either way she hates Nancy. And if we're going to be opening up the series to Mexican drug dealing (as we've done since the third season) shouldn't there be some note of the fact that the drug trade has turned Mexico into a war zone?The rest of the season is a lot of moments that almost beg the audience to love it all over again. Andy goes back to being skeazy. Celia steals pot and starts dealing it in the suburbs and gets a scene that mirrors the ending of season 1 (that mirrors the Godfather) and there's even a bit at the title sequence where they play ""Little Boxes"". But through it all, there's really nothing happening. The whole thing has become inert. Nancy doesn't even sell pot anymore. Hell, I don't know what Nancy does these days.The fact that this thing has been renewed for a sixth season might have something to do with its initial success when it was a great show but just might be laziness on the part of Showtime (and the fact that they can show ads with Mary Louise Parker who is gorgeous)",2,The thrill is gone,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,2326,"['Perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'appropriate', 'start', 'season', 'episode', 'Flash', 'Mob', 'Flash', 'Mobs', 'were', 'once', 'fun', 'weird', 'have', 'become', 'dull', 'tedious', 'repetition', 'corporate', 'sponsorship', 'renewed', 'popularity', 'dull', 'communities', 'course', 'metaphor', 'everything', 'else', 'season', 'set', 'remind', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'once', 'fun', 'Andy', 'make', 'THe', 'kids', 'are', 'freaky', 'Celia', 'as', 'awesome', 'ever', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'stuff', 'do', 'mostly', 'show', 'playing', 'time', 'quality', 'show', 'once', 'had', 'purpose', 'fell', 'away', 'are', 'even', 'back', 'suburbs', 'think.The', 'season', 'out', 'several', 'tight', 'situations', 'where', 'think', 'heroine', 'hot', 'water', 'finally', 'when', 'baby', 'born', 'domestic', 'tedium', 'moment', 'Esteban', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'relationship', 'Nancy', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'stupid', 'baby', 'henchmen', 'would', 'say', 'drag', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'much', 'show', 'begin', 'wish', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'writers', 'pulled', 'going', 'get', 'married', 'just', 'kidding', 'trick', 'was', 'kind', 'intrigue', 'involving', 'woman', 'who', 'campaign', 'advisor', 'other', 'mistress', 'way', 'Nancy', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'opening', 'up', 'series', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'dealing', ""'ve"", 'done', 'third', 'season', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'note', 'fact', 'drug', 'trade', 'turned', 'Mexico', 'war', 'zone', 'rest', 'season', 'lot', 'moments', 'almost', 'beg', 'audience', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'Andy', 'back', 'being', 'skeazy', 'Celia', 'steals', 'pot', 'dealing', 'suburbs', 'scene', 'ending', 'season', '1', 'Godfather', 'even', 'bit', 'title', 'sequence', 'where', 'play', 'Little', 'Boxes', 'really', 'nothing', 'happening', 'whole', 'thing', 'become', 'inert', 'Nancy', ""n't"", 'even', 'sell', 'pot', 'anymore', 'Hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Nancy', 'days.The', 'fact', 'thing', 'been', 'renewed', 'sixth', 'season', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'initial', 'success', 'when', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'laziness', 'part', 'Showtime', 'fact', 'can', 'show', 'ads', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'who', 'gorgeous']",N/A
