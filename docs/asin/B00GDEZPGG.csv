1678049,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,B00GDEZPGG,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[1, 2]","Dom Hemingway is a karmic tale about a violent-tempered, loud mouth egomaniac who is puzzled by the fact that he has terrible luck. After being released from prison, he simultaneously goes about cramming 12 years of lost debauchery into a very short time span and reconnecting with his estranged daughter and her new family. Dom is a man who knows the right thing to do, but because of his own pride and selfish ways, his nasty fate is doomed to repeat itself. The premise and ideas behind the film are surprisingly literary, in many ways mirroring the rise and fall of little Alex in A Clockwork Orange, yet writer/director Richard Shepard struggles to adapt Dom Hemingway into the astute drama it could have been. The scene's of Dom's comeuppance are choppy and poorly paced, acting more as clunky vignettes than regular scenes. The relationship between him and his daughter is nothing that will pull at the heart strings, mainly due to the fact that the film sheds very little light on their relationship to begin with. There is something about the pacing and the storytelling that makes Dom Hemingway seem more suitable as a novel than a film. As a novel, it could have taken more time to get to the conclusion and its abrupt story changes would be far more welcome. But as a film, it's at least capably directed and thrives off the animal energy of Jude Law. Law and his commitment to such an abrasive and unlikable character is clearly Dom Hemingway's strongest aspect. It may not reach its potential, and the story loses its grip when the poorly-introduced Lestor hits the scene, but it's worth watching for Jude Law's performance and some decent ideas about karma and fate.",3,Could Have Been A Classic,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1681,"['Dom', 'Hemingway', 'karmic', 'tale', 'violent-tempered', 'loud', 'mouth', 'egomaniac', 'who', 'puzzled', 'fact', 'terrible', 'luck', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'simultaneously', 'cramming', '12', 'years', 'lost', 'debauchery', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'span', 'reconnecting', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'new', 'family', 'Dom', 'man', 'who', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'own', 'pride', 'selfish', 'ways', 'nasty', 'fate', 'doomed', 'repeat', 'premise', 'ideas', 'film', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'literary', 'many', 'ways', 'mirroring', 'rise', 'fall', 'little', 'Alex', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'yet', 'writer/director', 'Richard', 'Shepard', 'adapt', 'Dom', 'Hemingway', 'astute', 'drama', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'scene', 'Dom', 'comeuppance', 'are', 'choppy', 'poorly', 'paced', 'acting', 'more', 'clunky', 'vignettes', 'regular', 'scenes', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'nothing', 'will', 'pull', 'heart', 'strings', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'film', 'sheds', 'very', 'little', 'light', 'relationship', 'begin', 'something', 'pacing', 'storytelling', 'Dom', 'Hemingway', 'seem', 'more', 'suitable', 'novel', 'film', 'novel', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'time', 'get', 'conclusion', 'abrupt', 'story', 'changes', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'welcome', 'film', 'least', 'capably', 'directed', 'off', 'animal', 'energy', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Law', 'commitment', 'abrasive', 'unlikable', 'character', 'clearly', 'Dom', 'Hemingway', 'strongest', 'aspect', 'may', 'not', 'reach', 'potential', 'story', 'grip', 'when', 'poorly-introduced', 'Lestor', 'scene', 'worth', 'watching', 'Jude', 'Law', 'performance', 'decent', 'ideas', 'karma', 'fate']",Dom Hemingway
1678050,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00GDEZPGG,C. Sawin,"[1, 3]","The first five minutes of &#34;Dom Hemingway&#34; are devoted to Jude Law going on a narcissistic tangent about how magnificent his genitalia is. The brief moments leading up to Dom's release from prison are stylized unusually; red screen, voice overs, and an image of Dom with a washed out contrast used for the title sequence. Dom's slow-motion strut signifying his status as a free man with dozens of cellmates chanting his name and throwing rolls of toilet paper in celebration informs you that this man has one hell of a story to tell.The humor in this British black comedy is fairly dark and twisted. Dom tracks down the man who his wife married after he went to prison, confronts him, and beats him within an inch of his life the very first thing after being let out. While Dom is sitting there catching his breath, he recognizes an old friend and catches up with him a bit before threatening the other man's life again. The majority of the comedy comes from Dom's explosive tirades and his inability to use any sort of filter whenever he speaks.At its core, &#34;Dom Hemingway&#34; is more than a crude film about a corrupt man convinced he's owed this massive debt. Dom missed his daughter's childhood and wants more than anything to be a part of her life again. In her early 20s, Evelyn (Emilia Clarke) is married with a child of her own yet wants nothing from the man who stepped out of her life over a decade ago. Dom meets a woman named Melody (Kerry Condon) along his adventures, who serves as a reminder that lady luck is never too far away from any situation.Despite Dom showing signs that he might slowly be drifting from the destructive path he finds himself barreling down the arc the character goes through is a sloppy one. Everything seems to rely on whether luck is on your side or not. Over the course of the film Dom realizes that everything comes full circle without him putting any sort of effort into really changing his ways. Everything ends up fixing itself when Dom is at his worst solely because luck is destined to help him out when he needs it the most.Jude Law gives an extremely passionate performance fueled by explosive fits of rage in &#34;Dom Hemingway.&#34; Law is in rare form here and is undeniably mesmerizing as the venom spewing, short fused, alcohol dependent titular character. Vulgar on the surface, &#34;Dom Hemingway&#34; is actually the story of a man short on his luck who desperately wants to reconnect with his daughter. Unfortunately the story finds itself running in circles and nothing feels resolved. &#34;Dom Hemingway&#34; feels like a Guy Ritchie film the English director would never admit to writing or directing.",3,Luck is for losers,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,2676,"['first', 'five', 'minutes', '34', 'Dom', 'Hemingway', '34', 'are', 'devoted', 'Jude', 'Law', 'going', 'narcissistic', 'tangent', 'how', 'magnificent', 'genitalia', 'brief', 'moments', 'leading', 'up', 'Dom', 'release', 'prison', 'are', 'stylized', 'unusually', 'red', 'screen', 'voice', 'overs', 'image', 'Dom', 'washed', 'contrast', 'used', 'title', 'sequence', 'Dom', 'slow-motion', 'strut', 'signifying', 'status', 'free', 'man', 'dozens', 'cellmates', 'chanting', 'name', 'throwing', 'rolls', 'toilet', 'paper', 'celebration', 'informs', 'man', 'one', 'hell', 'story', 'tell.The', 'humor', 'British', 'black', 'comedy', 'fairly', 'dark', 'twisted', 'Dom', 'tracks', 'down', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'married', 'went', 'prison', 'inch', 'life', 'very', 'first', 'thing', 'being', 'let', 'out', 'Dom', 'sitting', 'there', 'catching', 'breath', 'old', 'friend', 'up', 'bit', 'threatening', 'other', 'man', 'life', 'again', 'majority', 'comedy', 'Dom', 'explosive', 'tirades', 'inability', 'use', 'sort', 'filter', 'whenever', 'speaks.At', 'core', '34', 'Dom', 'Hemingway', '34', 'more', 'crude', 'film', 'corrupt', 'man', 'convinced', 'owed', 'massive', 'debt', 'Dom', 'missed', 'daughter', 'childhood', 'more', 'anything', 'be', 'part', 'life', 'again', 'early', '20s', 'Evelyn', 'Emilia', 'Clarke', 'married', 'child', 'own', 'yet', 'nothing', 'man', 'who', 'stepped', 'life', 'decade', 'ago', 'Dom', 'woman', 'named', 'Melody', 'Kerry', 'Condon', 'adventures', 'who', 'reminder', 'lady', 'luck', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'situation.Despite', 'Dom', 'showing', 'signs', 'might', 'slowly', 'be', 'drifting', 'destructive', 'path', 'barreling', 'down', 'arc', 'character', 'through', 'sloppy', 'one', 'Everything', 'rely', 'luck', 'side', 'not', 'course', 'film', 'Dom', 'everything', 'full', 'circle', 'putting', 'sort', 'effort', 'really', 'changing', 'ways', 'Everything', 'up', 'fixing', 'when', 'Dom', 'worst', 'solely', 'luck', 'destined', 'help', 'out', 'when', 'most.Jude', 'Law', 'extremely', 'passionate', 'performance', 'fueled', 'explosive', 'fits', 'rage', '34', 'Dom', 'Hemingway.', '34', 'Law', 'rare', 'form', 'here', 'undeniably', 'mesmerizing', 'venom', 'spewing', 'short', 'fused', 'alcohol', 'dependent', 'titular', 'character', 'Vulgar', 'surface', '34', 'Dom', 'Hemingway', '34', 'actually', 'story', 'man', 'short', 'luck', 'who', 'desperately', 'reconnect', 'daughter', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'running', 'circles', 'nothing', 'feels', 'resolved', '34', 'Dom', 'Hemingway', '34', 'feels', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'film', 'English', 'director', 'would', 'never', 'admit', 'writing', 'directing']",Dom Hemingway
1678051,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B00GDEZPGG,D. Holmes,"[7, 9]","In (and as) Dom Hemingway, Jude Law emancipates himself from his status as a beautiful leading man and delivers one of his finest performances to date.  He is heavier and unshaven.  He has a gold tooth.  And he is profane and violent:  the film opens with the character, a London thief nearing the end of his decade-plus period of incarceration, delivering an ecstatic soliloquy in ode to his, shall we say, manhood.  The enthusiastic quality of Law's performance, the sense he is eager to dive into this colorful rogue and explore each compartment and touch each sharp edge, both buoys and, in a way, betrays Dom Hemingway as a film.  It is a towering piece of acting.  Whether he is raging, seducing, stealing, or otherwise causing trouble, it is a delight to see Law move as the character and an even grander delight to hear him rip through the dialogue, laced as it is with obscenities and left-field cultural references, with ferocious machine-gun speed.  As Hemingway's closest (perhaps only) friend and previous partner-in-crime, Richard E. Grant, a cult icon of British comic cinema due to Withnail and I, is also very strong, embracing the role of the dry and wry straight man with poise and wit.Which leaves us with the film in which Law and Grant find themselves.  It is fine, solid even, and has a confident visual style defined by bright colors tempered by urban grit, yet it is also plagued by a modest, unspectacular air.  Tonal transitions, including a third-act emphasis on Hemingway's sentimental bid to win over his estranged daughter, are mechanical rather than graceful.  Its vision of an old-school gangster caught in a shifting and volatile landscape is never as persuasive as, say, The Long Good Friday, nor is the entire enterprise anywhere near as high-impact and well-woven as, say, Snatch.  In the end, we are left with a second-tier crime romp with a first-tier, downright majestic performance.  On a personal level, the vast pleasure I derived from Law's achievement largely compensates for the shortcomings of the film to which he has bequeathed the performance, though others' mileage will no doubt vary in this regard.",4,A decent crime comedy elevated by Jude Law's epic performance,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,2151,"['Dom', 'Hemingway', 'Jude', 'Law', 'status', 'beautiful', 'leading', 'man', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'date', 'heavier', 'unshaven', 'gold', 'tooth', 'profane', 'violent', 'film', 'character', 'London', 'thief', 'nearing', 'end', 'decade-plus', 'period', 'incarceration', 'delivering', 'ecstatic', 'soliloquy', 'ode', 'shall', 'say', 'manhood', 'enthusiastic', 'quality', 'Law', 'performance', 'sense', 'eager', 'dive', 'colorful', 'rogue', 'explore', 'compartment', 'touch', 'sharp', 'edge', 'buoys', 'way', 'Dom', 'Hemingway', 'film', 'towering', 'piece', 'acting', 'raging', 'seducing', 'stealing', 'otherwise', 'causing', 'trouble', 'delight', 'see', 'Law', 'move', 'character', 'even', 'grander', 'delight', 'hear', 'rip', 'dialogue', 'laced', 'obscenities', 'left-field', 'cultural', 'references', 'ferocious', 'machine-gun', 'speed', 'Hemingway', 'closest', 'perhaps', 'only', 'friend', 'previous', 'partner-in-crime', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'cult', 'icon', 'British', 'comic', 'cinema', 'due', 'Withnail', 'also', 'very', 'strong', 'embracing', 'role', 'dry', 'wry', 'straight', 'man', 'poise', 'wit.Which', 'film', 'Law', 'Grant', 'find', 'fine', 'solid', 'even', 'confident', 'visual', 'style', 'defined', 'bright', 'colors', 'tempered', 'urban', 'grit', 'also', 'plagued', 'modest', 'unspectacular', 'air', 'Tonal', 'transitions', 'including', 'third-act', 'emphasis', 'Hemingway', 'sentimental', 'bid', 'win', 'over', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'are', 'mechanical', 'rather', 'graceful', 'vision', 'old-school', 'gangster', 'caught', 'shifting', 'volatile', 'landscape', 'never', 'as', 'persuasive', 'say', 'Long', 'Good', 'Friday', 'entire', 'enterprise', 'anywhere', 'high-impact', 'well-woven', 'say', 'Snatch', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'second-tier', 'crime', 'romp', 'first-tier', 'downright', 'majestic', 'performance', 'personal', 'level', 'vast', 'pleasure', 'derived', 'Law', 'achievement', 'largely', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'bequeathed', 'performance', 'others', 'mileage', 'will', 'doubt', 'vary', 'regard']",Dom Hemingway

He always seems to come all the way to meet my expectation but never quite musters enough killer instinct. I liked him in Gattaca, Side Effects, Road To perdition, Alfie (he was ok) but I have never seen him truly be free.Dom Hemginway is where Jude Law truly outshines as the protagonist. From the very first scene you are taken aback and a bit out of words. There are many amazing scenes in the film where he truly outshines. He plays an alpha male. A man has just come out of jail after spending 12 years in prison. He doesn't know it's not good to smoke in bars no more, he doesn't know there are now electronic safes, all he knows is he needs his money to avenge his loss of time and life, it is very OVER THE TOP but it makes sense because JUDE LAW somehow (dont ask me how) pulls off the role with aplomb and glory.This is one of his best films, I'm truly proud of him. Its like this,Ben Kingsley had SEXY BEASTJoseph Gorden Levitt had HESHERNow Jude Law has Dom Hemingway and it was really needed.I strongly urge you to watch this film for Jude Law's performance alone. He is in every scene of the film. The film has various chapters, the music is pumping, the end is laconic, the story is not the best ever written but hey mate, you will not give a flying saucer on that accord.

Moore,"[3, 4]","Some directors like to test the endurance of their audiences, and Richard Shepard, writer-director of &#34;Dom Hemingway,&#34; is one of them. The very first scene shows the title character (Jude Law) naked in prison, shouting a long, profane and boastful tribute to his favorite anatomical feature. Long and profane monologues, we soon discover, are typical of Dom Hemingway, who has all the macho bravado of his author namesake if not that author's laconic style.Dom has spent 12 years in prison for safecracking; he would have gotten out sooner, but he refused to squeal on his boss, the mysterious and sinister Ivan Fontaine (Demian Bichir), in expectation of a big payday when he gets out. The movie is the story of what happens to Dom when he's finally sprung. There are many twists and turns he doesn't quite anticipate, though nearly all of them are caused by his notable lack of impulse control. Besides Fontaine, the characters involved include Dickie Black (Richard E. Grant), Dom's dapper best friend; Paolina (Madalina Ghenea), Fontaine's gorgeous but mercenary mistress; Evelyn (Emilia Clarke), Dom's grown daughter, who wants nothing to do with him; and Lester (Jumayn Hunter), a gangster who has never forgiven Dom for killing his cat.In the end, &#34;Dom Hemingway&#34; is a lightweight film. But it's a wild and usually exhilarating ride, thanks to Law's go-for-broke performance and the scintillating scatological dialogue Shepard writes for him.

1678057,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00GDEZPGG,Paul Allaer,"[6, 8]","""Dom Hemingway"" (2013 release from the UK; 94 min.) brings the story of the title character. As the movie opens, Dom is told that he is being released after a 12 year jail stint. Fresh out of jail, Dom and his best mate celebrate his release with a 3 day booze, sex and drug-filled outing, after which they go to France to visit Mr. Fontaine, who is holding the money that is owed to Dom for keeping his silence 12 years ago. In a parallel story, Dom eventually meets his now-grown daughter, who has become a young mother while Dom was in jail. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is all about Jude Law. In the trailer, the headliner comment was ""Jude Law like you've never seen him before"", and that is only the half of it. He is clearly enjoying himself in this outlandish role, Check out for example his startling monologue in jail that opens the movie. It helps that the script (from writer-director Richard Shepard) feeds him lots of quick lines that keep things loose. At some point Dom introduces himself to the young son of his estranged daughter: ""I'm Dom. Dom is English for unlucky son of a b**ch"", ha! Second, if it wasn't clear by now, the movie features plenty of swearing and crass expressions, as well as nudity, so if these things are offensive to you, stay away. Third, there is an interesting soundtrack that, besides the score from Rolke Kent, features plenty of great British bands like the Alarm, the Godfathers, Motorhead, Big Country and others.I had seen the trailer for this, and couldn't wait to see the movie. It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The matinee screening where I saw it at turned out to be a quasi-private screening, as there was literally only 1 other person in the theater besides myself.

1678058,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00GDEZPGG,Tommy Dooley,"[5, 7]","Meet Dom Hemingway he is a safe cracker who had done twelve years jail time and covered up for Europe's Mr Big - Mr Fontaine who is a Russian gangster with a penchant for killing things - especially people. Dom gets out and the first thing he does is seek retribution on the man who took care of his family while he was doing time. Then he goes on a three day bender before heading off to France to pick up his dues.He is accompanied by Dickie Black - played with effortless charm by Richard E. Grant. Dom seems to have a liking for alcohol, drugs, sex and swearing which he enjoys doing to excess. He also seems to have a knack for rubbing people up the wrong way. Things were never going to run smooth and what ensues is the highs and lows of his quest to get back his life and make up for the lost twelve years.This is essentially a one man performance from Jude Law as the man in the title. It lies somewhere between a gangster flick, social commentary (albeit it very lop sided) and dark humour. There are some brilliantly funny lines and Richard E. Grant gets to do time perfect delivery on more than one occasion. But for the high points there are many short comings, such as people behaving in a way that you would find hard to believe except outside of the medium of farce. The seemingly constant `potty mouth' and grand standing does start to wear a bit thin at times too and the fact that I found it incredibly difficult to like Mr Hemingway and please don't get me wrong I adore earthy expletives often wondering why our best are still over a thousand years old - surely time for some new ones? But if you can't like the main man then you are never going to really care too much what happens to him.Director and writer Richard Shepard knew what he wanted and it is fair to say that Jude Law does deliver in spades, but at the end of the day I felt the overall film left me a bit unbothered. There is still a lot to merit attention here especially the two leads and if you are a fan of either man then you will not be disappointed by this film but as an ensemble piece it did, for me, fall slightly short.",2,"Swearing, drugs, swearing, violence, shouting lots and some more swearing.",1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,2116,"['Meet', 'Dom', 'Hemingway', 'safe', 'cracker', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'twelve', 'years', 'jail', 'time', 'covered', 'up', 'Europe', 'Mr', 'Big', 'Mr', 'Fontaine', 'who', 'Russian', 'gangster', 'penchant', 'killing', 'things', 'especially', 'people', 'Dom', 'out', 'first', 'thing', 'seek', 'retribution', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'family', 'was', 'doing', 'time', 'Then', 'three', 'day', 'bender', 'heading', 'off', 'France', 'pick', 'up', 'dues.He', 'accompanied', 'Dickie', 'Black', 'played', 'effortless', 'charm', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'Dom', 'have', 'liking', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'sex', 'swearing', 'doing', 'excess', 'also', 'have', 'knack', 'rubbing', 'people', 'wrong', 'way', 'Things', 'were', 'never', 'going', 'run', 'smooth', 'what', 'highs', 'lows', 'quest', 'get', 'back', 'life', 'make', 'up', 'lost', 'twelve', 'years.This', 'essentially', 'one', 'man', 'performance', 'Jude', 'Law', 'man', 'title', 'somewhere', 'gangster', 'flick', 'social', 'commentary', 'very', 'lop', 'sided', 'dark', 'humour', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'lines', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'do', 'time', 'perfect', 'delivery', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'many', 'short', 'comings', 'such', 'people', 'behaving', 'way', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'outside', 'medium', 'farce', 'seemingly', 'constant', 'potty', 'mouth', 'grand', 'standing', 'start', 'wear', 'bit', 'thin', 'times', 'too', 'fact', 'found', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'like', 'Mr', 'Hemingway', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'adore', 'earthy', 'expletives', 'often', 'wondering', 'why', 'best', 'are', 'still', 'thousand', 'years', 'old', 'surely', 'time', 'new', 'ones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'like', 'main', 'man', 'then', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'really', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'him.Director', 'writer', 'Richard', 'Shepard', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'fair', 'say', 'Jude', 'Law', 'deliver', 'spades', 'end', 'day', 'felt', 'overall', 'film', 'left', 'bit', 'unbothered', 'still', 'lot', 'merit', 'attention', 'here', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'fan', 'man', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'did', 'fall', 'slightly', 'short']",Dom Hemingway

Now that he is out he tracks down the man who is the reason he was in jail and wants to collect what he is owed for his silence. Like most criminals though he finds it very easy to slip back into his old life. First thing I have to say about this movie is that the movie is not for the easily offended. Now that that is out of the way the movie is along the same lines of Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. A British action/comedy that is over the top and keeps you laughing and watching the whole way through. This is not as good as the other two but if you liked those types of movies then this is one you should watch. The movie is pretty offensive in parts but if you have seen the other two that that aspect probably won't bother you at all. Other then that there really isn't a whole lot more to say about it. Overall, I did like it but it's not something I think I could watch over and over. I give this a B-.",3,I did like it but it's not something I think I could watch over and over.
