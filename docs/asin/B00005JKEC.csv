The Academy Award nominated 'Training Day' is a terrific film using the remarkeable dramatic acting talents of both Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. It also takes the bar and raises it on gripping content in the dangerous world of police work, in this case narcotics in one of the most dangerous gang regions of the country. Taking place over a 24 hour period, decorated officer Alonso Harris molds and shapes a young, fresh-out-of-academy rookie beat cop (Hawke) into his idea of the LA narcotics officer that will get the job done right. Ethan Hawke slowely learns how rough of an edge the job has, where normal rules of Community Oriented Policing don't apply. In a powerfull scene during a raid of a drug kingpin's home, the line we're all so familiar with between what rules movie cops break and what lenghts are not gone to or discussed..is drawn what has to be the last possible time. I don't think anything done in the future with this kind of film or TV show could put a more surprising and shocking turn of events on police misconduct. Officer Harris' young trainee learns a new and untold meaning to 'Justifiable Homicide', what goes on behind closed doors of well-respected politicians and the cost of actually making the narcotics department work in this day and age...a cost that never makes the news quite the way it happens. I've read so many reviews from these four-eyed computer geek people who will sit here all day with their chocolate milk and tear the plot apart, complaining they 'don't understand why' this and they 'don't understand how' that...For instance the final confrontation in the film before Hawke hunts for his training officer, when Alonzo leaves for dead his trainee with the hispanic drug higher-ups. Not to give anything away, but if you listened to all the dialogue following the raid on Roger..when Denzel can be heard saying ""Make sure that bathtubs' clean ya hear?"", you can piece together the plot as Alonzo, knowing the family to the young girl rookie Hawke saves from rape on the street, would know that Hawke would explain to the girl's cousin how he saved her in order to save his own life...I mean the movie IS called 'TRAINING Day'. The film produces incredibly well-done performances by both stars and supporting cast, and this could possibly be the LAST great police drama that sets you on the edge of your seat and makes you compare in your head the lies, crimes and daily events of law enforcement within the story to news and real events of police drama on the streets in this country. It holds it's ground, does'nt attempt to make anything seem more comforting to the viewers, and ends on a small audio note SO appropriate to the entire film it almost makes me cry its' so good.",5,Welcome the New Age of Police Drama On Screen,1056672000,"06 27, 2003",2003,2883,"[""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'run', 'fingers', 'keyboard', 'everyone', 'else', 'trying', 'write', 'essay', 'college', ""would'nt"", 'really', 'even', 'call', 'review', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', ""'Training"", 'Day', 'terrific', 'film', 'using', 'remarkeable', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'talents', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'also', 'bar', 'gripping', 'content', 'dangerous', 'world', 'police', 'work', 'case', 'narcotics', 'one', 'most', 'dangerous', 'gang', 'regions', 'country', 'Taking', 'place', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'decorated', 'officer', 'Alonso', 'Harris', 'molds', 'young', 'fresh-out-of-academy', 'rookie', 'beat', 'cop', 'Hawke', 'idea', 'LA', 'narcotics', 'officer', 'will', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'right', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'slowely', 'how', 'rough', 'edge', 'job', 'where', 'normal', 'rules', 'Community', 'Oriented', 'Policing', 'do', ""n't"", 'apply', 'powerfull', 'scene', 'raid', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'home', 'line', ""'re"", 'so', 'familiar', 'what', 'rules', 'movie', 'cops', 'break', 'what', 'lenghts', 'are', 'not', 'gone', 'discussed..is', 'drawn', 'be', 'last', 'possible', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'done', 'future', 'kind', 'film', 'TV', 'show', 'could', 'put', 'more', 'surprising', 'shocking', 'turn', 'events', 'police', 'misconduct', 'Officer', 'Harris', 'young', 'trainee', 'new', 'untold', 'meaning', ""'Justifiable"", 'Homicide', 'what', 'closed', 'doors', 'well-respected', 'politicians', 'cost', 'actually', 'making', 'narcotics', 'department', 'work', 'day', 'age', 'cost', 'never', 'news', 'quite', 'way', ""'ve"", 'read', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'four-eyed', 'computer', 'geek', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'sit', 'here', 'day', 'chocolate', 'milk', 'tear', 'plot', 'apart', 'complaining', ""'do"", ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', ""'do"", ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'instance', 'final', 'confrontation', 'film', 'Hawke', 'hunts', 'training', 'officer', 'when', 'Alonzo', 'dead', 'trainee', 'hispanic', 'drug', 'higher-ups', 'Not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'listened', 'dialogue', 'following', 'raid', 'Roger..when', 'Denzel', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'saying', 'Make', 'sure', 'bathtubs', 'clean', 'ya', 'hear', 'can', 'piece', 'together', 'plot', 'Alonzo', 'knowing', 'family', 'young', 'girl', 'rookie', 'Hawke', 'rape', 'street', 'would', 'know', 'Hawke', 'would', 'explain', 'girl', 'cousin', 'how', 'saved', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'mean', 'movie', 'IS', 'called', ""'TRAINING"", 'Day', 'film', 'incredibly', 'well-done', 'performances', 'stars', 'supporting', 'cast', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'LAST', 'great', 'police', 'drama', 'sets', 'edge', 'seat', 'compare', 'head', 'lies', 'crimes', 'daily', 'events', 'law', 'enforcement', 'story', 'news', 'real', 'events', 'police', 'drama', 'streets', 'country', 'ground', ""does'nt"", 'attempt', 'make', 'anything', 'seem', 'more', 'comforting', 'viewers', 'small', 'audio', 'note', 'SO', 'appropriate', 'entire', 'film', 'almost', 'cry', 'so', 'good']",N/A
586184,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,B00005JKEC,Adi Adler,"[1, 1]","The movie itself has a somehow perdictable story but the acting which is superb, lifts the story above its 'standard' plot.Alonzo's intentions about Jake's 'Training Day' are not what Jake (and us) think they are at the beginning of the movie. Alonzo's original intentions seemed to be to shock him and corrupt him - he perceives Jake as innocent, and wants to have some 'fun' with him. A good example of that is what he says after the squad kills Roger - he's been plannig Jake's day for a week. That's obvious on a second watching: he made sure he'd have PCP laced weed pretty early in the day, and knows how to push Jake into smoking it - just to make sure he has something he can control Jake with if he needs to... But he hardly has to use it against Jake throughout the day: he's in total control, and knows the turf, and the 'street rules' - unlike Jake, who's new and too idealistic to unerstand them - at least at first. The 'Training Day' isn't meant to train Jake to join Alonzo's unit, but after it's over Jake has received some valuable training: how he can survive in the streets. Some of what he learns comes from Alonzo, but he manages to combine it with his own common sense - by taking the girl's wallet, he eventually manages to save his own life, even though Alonzo discourages him - after all, Alonzo's 'Street Justice' has been done. This goes against another one of Alonzo's lessons: don't show your sensitivities to the world. But by showing it in case of the girl - again, he manages to not only save his life, but to establish a connection with Smiley, which might help him later on.As the day (and the movie) progresses, we see that Alonzo's attitude towards ake changes - he starts taking him seriously, until he realizes how much Jake doesn't fit in when they raid Roger's house. But he still doesn't take him seriously enough - when Jake comes by his house after survivng the poker game, Alonzo still tries to pretend that it was all a test, and having survived the experience made him get into the squad. But Alonzo hadn't realized that he'd taken it too far, just as he doesn't realize it about other events in his life - he thinks that the neighborhood's fear of him is respect, for instance. Or his son -the little boy trusts Jake after only one meeting more than Alonzo could ever hope for. And this time - Alonzo isn't able to use his charm or force as a policeman to get out of this situation...",5,TRAINING DAY,1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,2432,"['movie', 'somehow', 'perdictable', 'story', 'acting', 'superb', 'story', ""'standard"", 'plot.Alonzo', 'intentions', 'Jake', ""'Training"", 'Day', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'Jake', 'think', 'are', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Alonzo', 'original', 'intentions', 'seemed', 'be', 'shock', 'corrupt', 'Jake', 'innocent', 'have', ""'fun"", 'good', 'example', 'what', 'squad', 'Roger', 'been', 'plannig', 'Jake', 'day', 'week', 'obvious', 'second', 'watching', 'made', 'sure', ""'d"", 'have', 'PCP', 'laced', 'weed', 'pretty', 'early', 'day', 'how', 'push', 'Jake', 'smoking', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'something', 'can', 'control', 'Jake', 'hardly', 'use', 'Jake', 'day', 'total', 'control', 'turf', ""'street"", 'rules', 'Jake', 'who', 'new', 'too', 'idealistic', 'unerstand', 'least', 'first', ""'Training"", 'Day', ""n't"", 'meant', 'train', 'Jake', 'join', 'Alonzo', 'unit', 'over', 'Jake', 'received', 'valuable', 'training', 'how', 'can', 'survive', 'streets', 'what', 'Alonzo', 'combine', 'own', 'common', 'sense', 'taking', 'girl', 'wallet', 'eventually', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'even', 'Alonzo', 'Alonzo', ""'Street"", 'Justice', 'been', 'done', 'one', 'Alonzo', 'lessons', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'sensitivities', 'world', 'showing', 'case', 'girl', 'again', 'not', 'only', 'save', 'life', 'establish', 'connection', 'Smiley', 'might', 'help', 'later', 'on.As', 'day', 'movie', 'see', 'Alonzo', 'attitude', 'towards', 'ake', 'changes', 'taking', 'seriously', 'how', 'much', 'Jake', ""n't"", 'fit', 'when', 'raid', 'Roger', 'house', 'still', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'enough', 'when', 'Jake', 'house', 'survivng', 'poker', 'game', 'Alonzo', 'still', 'pretend', 'was', 'test', 'having', 'survived', 'experience', 'made', 'get', 'squad', 'Alonzo', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', ""'d"", 'taken', 'too', 'far', 'just', ""n't"", 'realize', 'other', 'events', 'life', 'neighborhood', 'fear', 'respect', 'instance', 'son', '-the', 'little', 'boy', 'trusts', 'Jake', 'only', 'one', 'meeting', 'more', 'Alonzo', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'time', 'Alonzo', ""n't"", 'able', 'use', 'charm', 'force', 'policeman', 'get', 'situation']",N/A
586185,A3ONKRWEZMJJUV,B00005JKEC,"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista""","[1, 1]","Well, some police action with a twisted Cop as the main bad guy inter forcing with a young Detective wannabe, somewhere between a Gangster story and a Police Urban flick. Training Day is about the thin line between the good protocol deed and the confusing brutal police methods in the every day patrolling Black and Latin ghettos, either you are the victim or the aggressor, and so the young trainee (Ethan Hawk), has a full day to learn the ways of brutality, a one in a life time shot to become a Wolf among Wolves, but is all about mind games.Training Day greatest quality relies on its two main characters; the story is constructed upon an ambiguous Police detective (Alonzo Harris), famously known by his unorthodox techniques, most meticulously malignant and disguised as effectively direct, masterfully planning the only one move that can saves his a..., Densel Washington does a wonderful and strong profile of this corrupted police man, both cruel and wise (this is the one role that is away from those alike idealistic and moral characters Denzel is used to portrait), his always imposing presence and sharp skills are a perfect match for the character, and Denzel expresses every glimpse and  words with a percuasive and frightening tone, the exact requiremend for this role that has the whole movie in his backs. Ethan Hawk does an equally fine job as the young but smart Rookie, not a supportive role but a main one (Denzel won the 2002 Academy Award for this performance, and Ethan Hawk was nominated for Best Supporting role). The film goes strong and intensive until the end, where it should have ended when the Rookie catches Alonzo at his lovers apartment, but Alonzo's death is to much stretched out and turn both silly and un-believable, slowing the pace and breaking all the roughness of the concept, a very unfortunately decision that turns Training Day in another movie with a good beginning and a bad ending. If the decision was taken because of the Studio feeling that the story needed to enhanced the ending by making it more unexpected (they thought), or because Washington put hand to save some of his more histrionic moments, it doesn't mattered (neither the alternated ending), because, this was decided to be the definitive Cut (that's why the other ending is labeled as Alternated), and so all the carefully constructed psychological atmosphere of Aggressive against the righteous public, falls down heavily, and you no longer feel seduced by the plot (maybe I am wrong, and this was the director's idea). Another thing is that the Alonzo character needed some more ambiguity as the story develops, but that's a little something.Antoine Fuqua sustains his good direction towards the ending, where it falls down by  the oppression of whatever situation with the Big shots, (remember, most Producers and Studio Executive, are nothing more than Bankers), no Pink Wallet saved the situation, and so Alonzo Harris falls by his own WEIGHT, for all the bad deeds he made, at the end they felt heavily on his shoulders, gravity is something terrible.A very smart blend between the original score and the songs (mostly Gangster's Rap), fulfills the action and still moments. Nice photography and perfect settings locations does some more goods for the film. What ever the film is a realistic portrait of Police Corruption or a blown up idea of the Truth because of its action possibilities and appealing, well only an L.A. Cop knows for sure, but the film is close enough to the real thing with some commercial inserts in it, but it can't be taken as a lesson or as an important film in that matter, nothing more than a nice action movie with something more to it.",3,"Gravital Constant; G= 6,67x10(-8)cm36m(-1)Sec(-2).",1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,3687,"['Well', 'police', 'action', 'twisted', 'Cop', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'inter', 'forcing', 'young', 'Detective', 'wannabe', 'somewhere', 'Gangster', 'story', 'Police', 'Urban', 'flick', 'Training', 'Day', 'thin', 'line', 'good', 'protocol', 'deed', 'confusing', 'brutal', 'police', 'methods', 'day', 'patrolling', 'Black', 'Latin', 'ghettos', 'are', 'victim', 'aggressor', 'so', 'young', 'trainee', 'Ethan', 'Hawk', 'full', 'day', 'learn', 'ways', 'brutality', 'one', 'life', 'time', 'shot', 'become', 'Wolf', 'Wolves', 'mind', 'games.Training', 'Day', 'greatest', 'quality', 'relies', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'constructed', 'ambiguous', 'Police', 'detective', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'famously', 'known', 'unorthodox', 'techniques', 'most', 'meticulously', 'malignant', 'disguised', 'effectively', 'direct', 'masterfully', 'planning', 'only', 'one', 'move', 'can', 'saves', 'Densel', 'Washington', 'wonderful', 'strong', 'profile', 'corrupted', 'police', 'man', 'cruel', 'wise', 'one', 'role', 'away', 'alike', 'idealistic', 'moral', 'characters', 'Denzel', 'used', 'portrait', 'always', 'imposing', 'presence', 'sharp', 'skills', 'are', 'perfect', 'match', 'character', 'Denzel', 'glimpse', 'words', 'percuasive', 'frightening', 'tone', 'exact', 'requiremend', 'role', 'whole', 'movie', 'backs', 'Ethan', 'Hawk', 'equally', 'fine', 'job', 'young', 'smart', 'Rookie', 'not', 'supportive', 'role', 'main', 'one', 'Denzel', 'won', '2002', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'Ethan', 'Hawk', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'role', 'film', 'strong', 'intensive', 'end', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'when', 'Rookie', 'catches', 'Alonzo', 'lovers', 'apartment', 'Alonzo', 'death', 'much', 'stretched', 'out', 'turn', 'silly', 'un-believable', 'slowing', 'pace', 'breaking', 'roughness', 'concept', 'very', 'unfortunately', 'decision', 'Training', 'Day', 'movie', 'good', 'beginning', 'bad', 'ending', 'decision', 'was', 'taken', 'because', 'Studio', 'feeling', 'story', 'needed', 'enhanced', 'ending', 'making', 'more', 'unexpected', 'thought', 'Washington', 'put', 'hand', 'save', 'more', 'histrionic', 'moments', ""n't"", 'mattered', 'alternated', 'ending', 'because', 'was', 'decided', 'be', 'definitive', 'Cut', 'why', 'other', 'ending', 'labeled', 'Alternated', 'so', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'psychological', 'atmosphere', 'Aggressive', 'righteous', 'public', 'down', 'heavily', 'no', 'longer', 'feel', 'seduced', 'plot', 'maybe', 'am', 'wrong', 'was', 'director', 'idea', 'thing', 'Alonzo', 'character', 'needed', 'more', 'ambiguity', 'story', 'little', 'something.Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'good', 'direction', 'ending', 'where', 'down', 'oppression', 'situation', 'Big', 'shots', 'remember', 'most', 'Producers', 'Studio', 'Executive', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'Bankers', 'Pink', 'Wallet', 'saved', 'situation', 'so', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'falls', 'own', 'WEIGHT', 'bad', 'deeds', 'made', 'end', 'felt', 'heavily', 'shoulders', 'gravity', 'something', 'terrible.A', 'very', 'smart', 'blend', 'original', 'score', 'songs', 'mostly', 'Gangster', 'Rap', 'action', 'still', 'moments', 'Nice', 'photography', 'perfect', 'settings', 'locations', 'more', 'goods', 'film', 'What', 'ever', 'film', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'Police', 'Corruption', 'blown', 'up', 'idea', 'Truth', 'action', 'possibilities', 'appealing', 'well', 'only', 'L.A.', 'Cop', 'sure', 'film', 'close', 'enough', 'real', 'thing', 'commercial', 'inserts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'lesson', 'important', 'film', 'matter', 'nothing', 'more', 'nice', 'action', 'movie', 'something', 'more']",N/A

586194,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKEC,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","There is no denying that `Training Day' is remarkably entertaining and wholly engaging from start to finish.  In fact, this is one of those films that leaves the viewer with baited breath, constantly wrapping us around its tightly woven finger to keep us engaged and engrossed, thoroughly.That said, this is not a film that ages remarkably well.  Yes, it remains entertaining and exciting, but upon reflection it becomes easy to point out the flaws.It isn't as smart as I remembered it being.Still, there is little not to like about this film.  Yes, it is violent and littered with profanities, but if you know anything about this movie then you should know what you are walking into and so you really have no room to complain about those things.  This is a gritty cop movie filled with drugs and gangsters and death; and the trailer alone kind of made that evident.The film follows a rookie cop named Jake as he gets a taste of the job from his new partner, Alonzo Harris.  Alonzo is a rough and tumble cop who is apparently crooked.  The job has hardened him, making him ruthless and corruptible.  Jake has not yet been manipulated by his profession.  He is still green and his naivety makes him an easy (allegedly) target for Alonzo's games.  As their day together escalates, things happen that set off a series of alarms in Jake's head.  This is not going to be your typical day on the job.  As the day draws to a close it becomes apparent that Alonzo has had a lot more than just work on his mind, and soon violence spreads like a plague over this newfound, explosive partnership.For me, this film is intensely edited and directed to capture your interest and hold it firmly in its grip.  Each scene is manipulated in a way to keep us glued.  This is a blessing, but upon reflection it also seems like a curse.  The film dissolves into nothing more than a series of scenes; no real moving plot just exciting moments strung together.  When it does try to form a plot it winds up becoming a tad too far fetched for its own good.  It works solely because of the pacing and the performances.  If left on its own right the film would have fallen apart.Those performances (or the two that matter) are beautifully compatible.  For me, this is easily Ethan Hawkes movie.  So much love and flattery has been showered on Denzel Washington for his performance here, but that is only because it is flashy and baity.  Honestly, Hawke had the harder character to formulate, someone who is suppressed in his own convictions as he observes and reacts to the outlandish behavior of someone he cannot trust yet needs to in order to survive.  He has to make his subtle performance equal Washington's flamboyant one or else he suffers becoming overshadowed and thus forgotten.  I'm so glad he got the Oscar nomination, even if it was in the wrong category (how in the world was he supporting?).  Denzel is very good here, if not a tad over the top.  He nails a lot of scenes (the introduction scene in the diner is still one of my favorite moments in film this entire decade) but he also goes overboard a few times.  He runs that fine line between intense and hammy.Hawke wins.In the end I give this a solid B+.  I still think that the script is the films weakest link.  It has a nice contrast of morality at play here, and it had the potential to really tap into that concept (and it does to a degree) but the overall plot just doesn't stand up on its own.  It works far better as a concept than an actual story.  That said, the fresh take on direction and the solid performances make this a must see film, and one that you will surely enjoy.",4,Chewing scenery and spitting it out...,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,3628,"['denying', 'Training', 'Day', 'remarkably', 'entertaining', 'wholly', 'engaging', 'start', 'finish', 'fact', 'one', 'films', 'viewer', 'baited', 'breath', 'constantly', 'wrapping', 'tightly', 'woven', 'finger', 'keep', 'engaged', 'engrossed', 'said', 'not', 'film', 'remarkably', 'well', 'Yes', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'reflection', 'easy', 'point', 'out', 'flaws.It', ""n't"", 'as', 'smart', 'remembered', 'being.Still', 'little', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'Yes', 'violent', 'littered', 'profanities', 'know', 'anything', 'movie', 'then', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'walking', 'so', 'really', 'have', 'room', 'complain', 'things', 'gritty', 'cop', 'movie', 'filled', 'drugs', 'gangsters', 'death', 'trailer', 'alone', 'kind', 'made', 'evident.The', 'film', 'rookie', 'cop', 'named', 'Jake', 'taste', 'job', 'new', 'partner', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'Alonzo', 'rough', 'tumble', 'cop', 'who', 'apparently', 'crooked', 'job', 'hardened', 'making', 'ruthless', 'corruptible', 'Jake', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'manipulated', 'profession', 'still', 'green', 'naivety', 'easy', 'allegedly', 'target', 'Alonzo', 'games', 'day', 'together', 'things', 'happen', 'set', 'off', 'series', 'alarms', 'Jake', 'head', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'typical', 'day', 'job', 'day', 'close', 'apparent', 'Alonzo', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'work', 'mind', 'soon', 'violence', 'spreads', 'plague', 'newfound', 'explosive', 'partnership.For', 'film', 'intensely', 'edited', 'directed', 'capture', 'interest', 'hold', 'firmly', 'grip', 'scene', 'manipulated', 'way', 'keep', 'glued', 'blessing', 'reflection', 'also', 'curse', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'series', 'scenes', 'real', 'moving', 'plot', 'just', 'exciting', 'moments', 'strung', 'together', 'When', 'try', 'form', 'plot', 'up', 'becoming', 'tad', 'too', 'far', 'fetched', 'own', 'good', 'solely', 'pacing', 'performances', 'left', 'own', 'right', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'apart.Those', 'performances', 'two', 'matter', 'are', 'beautifully', 'compatible', 'easily', 'Ethan', 'Hawkes', 'movie', 'So', 'much', 'love', 'flattery', 'been', 'showered', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'performance', 'here', 'only', 'flashy', 'baity', 'Honestly', 'Hawke', 'had', 'harder', 'character', 'formulate', 'someone', 'who', 'suppressed', 'own', 'convictions', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'someone', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'yet', 'order', 'survive', 'make', 'subtle', 'performance', 'equal', 'Washington', 'flamboyant', 'one', 'else', 'becoming', 'overshadowed', 'thus', 'forgotten', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'even', 'was', 'wrong', 'category', 'how', 'world', 'was', 'supporting', 'Denzel', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'not', 'tad', 'top', 'lot', 'scenes', 'introduction', 'scene', 'diner', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'moments', 'film', 'entire', 'decade', 'also', 'overboard', 'few', 'times', 'fine', 'line', 'intense', 'hammy.Hawke', 'wins.In', 'end', 'give', 'solid', 'B+', 'still', 'think', 'script', 'films', 'weakest', 'link', 'nice', 'contrast', 'morality', 'play', 'here', 'had', 'potential', 'really', 'tap', 'concept', 'degree', 'overall', 'plot', 'just', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'far', 'better', 'concept', 'actual', 'story', 'said', 'fresh', 'take', 'direction', 'solid', 'performances', 'make', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy']",N/A
586195,ARA48345JZPZR,B00005JKEC,Archmaker,"[1, 1]","Well, Denzel's Oscar was no Hollywood ""gimme"", he earned it all the way with a powerful and disturbing portrayal.  Beside being a consistently terrific actor, Denzel Washington is a true Movie Star.  He commands the screen the way the young Brando or Newman did, with complete authority.  And he was really on his game here.  The 5 stars are for his performance!I have not been a fan of Ethan Hawke in some of his earlier, arsty-fartsy Mr. Sensitivo roles.  So I was surprised at how well he held his own opposite the power of Washington in this film.  Will reserve judgement on Mr. Hawke for the future.So, these two fine nominated & deserving performances are worth the trip alone.  The film's main problem is it becomes a bit excessive & melodramatic toward the end.  Will put some off, but by then, I was hooked into the flick and was willing to go wherever it went.Not just about a twisted cop who has completely lost his moral compass and bearings and has become the thing he started out to destroy, the Hawke character gets in deep because of his own ambition, the same type of desire for power that must have fed Washington's young Alonzo, before his complete corruption.So we have a two character waltz, of the seducer (the Devil assumes a pleasing shape) and the honest, naive, but flawed  seducee.  We watch Alonzo tempt and belittle and flatter his young protege, bending him to his will.  We watch Jake be shocked, resist and argue but give in to his own ambition.  And there are surprises to come.The movie is tough & brutal, the dialogue fast & gritty,  the direction fluid and restless, all pulsing to the beat of these hot LA streets.

Mesa,"[2, 6]","I almost turned this dvd down as a rental because I did not want to see another ""good cop goes bad"" flick...I am glad I rented it !By now, it is no secret that Denzel's character Alonzo is bad to the bone and rotten to the core all the way from the start of the film. We are only given very subtle background hints as to his character's so called ""reasons"" for his fall from grace.Yet, it is never quite clear as to what the actual event was that pushed him over the edge or if it was a culmination of events...The acting performances were absolutely outstanding and stunning !Ethan Hawke's performance deserves high praise;he was perfect for his role. He had that young, ""wet behind the ears"" thing going for him.He was very credible and looked the part. But his chracter also demonstrated that strength and honor should not be judged by physical appearances or on one's age alone ! In one day Hawke's rookie character goes from being naive to... well, getting his...popped in a figurative manner. The difference one day in the life of a rookie drug/undercover enforcement officer will make after ""learning"" the ropes from Alonzo will probably make him rethink his next career choice or move !I can now fully understand why Washington received the Oscar...I have never felt so much disgust and contempt for an onscreen law enforcement character gone bad...way bad as I did for this one ! Who said the Oscar for Best Actor can only go to those who played the role of good guy.The story is gritty and compelling and shows the world that even certain heroes that uphold the law are still human and fallible...this not excusing the fact that a choice ultimately has to be made of whether choosing good or evil and upholding one's own accountability for immoral/illegal actions (there is no ""gray area""...as so many of us would like to believe)!

While there is no mistaking the excellent performance of either Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke in this tale of a cop gone bad after spending too much time on the street, the mind reels to consider Washington performed as well as did Tom Wilkinson in ""In The Bedroom"" or Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind'. This movie is just not that much of a showcase for Denzel's considerable talents.To begin with, the plot is hardly plausible, and it is downright silly to believe such patent nonsense as is presented here as the events transpiring in a single day.  Shades of James Bond! Whatever happened to the idea of presenting something believable? If we are talking ""B"" movie entertainment, fine. But if we are going to consider giving an actor an Oscar for an outstanding performance, it might be nice to have him deliver that role in something less than pop fantasy. Shades of old Rooster Cogburn in ""True Grit""! As a fantasy escape vehicle, this gritty cop drama works well, but as a serious drama, it has holes big enough for Shallow Hal's girlfriend to waddle through.All that said, it is an entertaining and action packed film. Indeed, this is a film overdosing on adrenaline, a movie with nothing but ups and precious few downers, except, of course, for the morality play at the end that serves, of course, to provide the filmgoer with a sense of closure and wrap the enigma of this bad cop up with a bow.  Yet a lot of bad guys get away with it, and this character certainly seems street-wise enough to have maneuvered his way out of the dilemma.

I bought it because of Denzel getting the Academy Award. I don't think any preview can prepare you for this movie. Denzel plays a nacotics cop who heads a squad who plays both sides of the street. And what a street it is. Gang bangers, drug dealers, poverty all rear their ugly head here.This movie takes place over the span of one day and tells the story of a young officer played by Ethan Hawke riding with Denzel for the first time as a new member of this narcotics unit. Hawke's character sees being in this elite unit as a way to make it higher up into the Department on the way to detective. But he has no idea that Denzel and his unit have their own set of rules, many contrary to the Law and he must choose to stay with his moral duty to uphold the Law or give it up to join Denzel and advance his career.This movie shows the way the streets are on the ""other side of the tracks"". My wife told me she never wanted to go to LA after seeing it.

However, I think where this film surpasses others of its genre is Hawke's decent performance that complements Washington's. He plays the shy and introverted policeman in a such a way that the viewer can't help but hoping that Washington's character will not betray him but what you see is not what you get in the case of 'Training Day'.I loved this DVD because it had many great extra features such as the music video and the fact that the film was subtitled in many varied languages.

For instance, the overall tone of the film, with its immense amounts of violence and foul language, and completely oppressive sense of hopelessness, is not exactly my idea of a pleasurable motion picture experience.  Still, considering the subject matter, it is appropriate and the filmmakers bring it across quite well.The subject matter is the world of vice cops, and if this tale is to be believed, they're all corrupt.  In fact, not only the vice cops but the heads of several major departments within the LAPD are all lost souls without redeeming graces.  This is a world where evil battles evil, and the prizes are convictions in court and large amounts of cash.  The only real law, however, is the law of the jungle.  This is unrealistic to the point of losing its cred, and is overdone.Denzel Washington earned his Oscar for Best Actor in portraying plainclothes narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who has the task of training young Jake (Ethan Hawke) in the ways of the trade.  Washington does an incredible job of keeping us all guessing as to Alonzo's true nature, as he neatly justifies all of his disgusting and irredeemable actions on the streets, and Jake (and we) continually have to wonder whether to go along with Alonzo or just give up and hate the man.  By the time Alonzo's corruption is fully revealed, Jake, the only character in the entire film with a sense of hope, has had his hope dashed as well as us.All this is beautifully done.  Unlike at least one other reviewer here, I had no problem with the pacing, the dialogue, etc., but found the craft of filmmaking quite well done in most respects.  The major shortcoming for me, other than the overall filth of it all, was a couple of acting performances that really messed things up.One of these is a child actor, a kid who plays Alonzo's son.  This tyke is detached from his world to a completely unbelievable degree, reacting to everyone and everything with absolute boredom, even an extended shootout in his own apartment.  Honestly, the director could have propped up a cardboard cutout of a child and gotten as much out of it.  Even worse is Snoop Dogg, who couldn't lose himself in a character if you drugged, blindfolded, and handcuffed him and parachuted him into the role.  Oh wait, no need to drug this overrated goof.Ultimately this is well worth four stars for its effectiveness and for the performance of Washington, a favorite of mine who is brilliant beyond words in this role.  Still, the tone and content made me feel as if I'd been bathed in a barrel of filthy oil.

If your goal is more intelligent fare this may not be for you.The story involves a day in the life of LAPD rookie officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke)as he attempts to join an elite narcotics division led by decorated officer Alonzo Harris( Denzel Washington) What Hoyt does not realize is that Harris is not as good a cop as he is made out to be. Denzel Washington (in his Oscar winning role) plays the bad cop with gusto. While it may not be his best performance it certainly is not his worst. Washington comes across as a kind of police version of Tony Montana and the end of the film becomes sort of cartoonish.Hawke does a good job playing the rookie who makes bad choices throughout the film Fuqua says that these choices are all related to ambition and I will buy into that theory to some extent.This is essentially a two character film and both leads acquit themselves quite well. Support is offered by Eva Mendes as Alonzo's girlfriend, Macy Gray as the wife of a drug dealer, Dr. Dre as a member of Alonzo's unit and Snoop Dogg as another dealer on the streets. Los Angeles is portrayed to great effect and the texture is suitably gritty. Fuqua shot the film in parts of the city that most tourists don't see and the viewer feels the pulse of the streets.I will admit that I liked the film more after a second viewing with Fuqua's audio commentary.

And with the hype about this movie when it came out, I walked away from the theater a bit unsatisfied.When he received an Oscar for this role (as oppossed to some other movies) I felt the same way the I did when Russell Crowe received one for Gladiator and not A Beautiful Mind. But that seems to happen at the Oscars.Both Hawke and Washington turn in overall good performances (I think Hawke was better based on his role) about corruption in a police department, where Denzel is knee deep in it.There were some very good scenes, but I did find that the movie dragged a bit. And when things became really heated during the second half of the movie, some of the scenes to me were a bit over the top/drawn out.

586218,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00005JKEC,casualsuede,"[3, 4]","Movies about ""the streets"" are not uncommon. Movies like Colors have gone through this in the past. Training Day is no different, but this films is head and shoulder above the others due to the main leads.Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a young, ambitious cop who gets a shot at the high profile Narcotics Squad. He is going through a ""Training day"" with Detective Alonzo Harris, a tough 13 year veteran with 15,000 man-hours worth of arrests under his belt.Right off, Hoyt, who is still idealistic, is given the harsh brutality of the streets both through Harris' descriptions and events, such as seeing a girl being raped on the street. However, there is a plot associated with this movie and it involves Alonzo Harris and a certain Russian mafia figure. This ""relationship"" sets the underlying premise throughout the whole movie and explains the dual nature of Harris' character that came about sort of as a shock near the 2/3rd point of the movie.Let me first say that I don't believe that Denzel role as the Rogue Cop deserved an Oscar win. He has done better work in movies like Malcolm X and The Hurricane. However, he is the strong point of the movie. His Alonzo Harris is both ruthless and father-figurish and has an appeal that hooks Hoyt in. He truly is a wolf in sheep's clothing. He steals every scene he is in and takes command of the movie from Ethan Hawke. This is natural since Hawke plays the character as a learner (aka the straight man), but he manages to get a lot of empathy from the audience and provides the needed integrity that Hoyt strives for.The storyline, while generic, is well filmed by Antoine Fuqua. His previous attempts (Bait, The Replacement Killers) were failures, but he does redeem himself with this movie. He lenses the evil that lies on the inner city streets and those who know LA through movies such as LA Story maybe surprised how dark the City of Angels can be. While this movie does not put the city in the best of lights, Fuqua does a great job showing the dangerous realities of LA, including introducing low live characters such as Blue (Snoop Dogg), Smiley (Cliff Curtis) and Crazy Sniper (Raymond Cruz). However, he can't get around the generic story and predictable ending and that puts a damper on the movie itself.However, if you want to see an action movie that is a cut above the rest, Training Day would fit the ticket....Rating: B-Note: Harris shows Hoyt a picture of himself when he was younger. However, it is a picture of Nick Styles....A character that Denzel Washington played in Ricochet.",3,We've seen this all before...just without Denzel...,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,2550,"['Movies', 'streets', 'are', 'not', 'uncommon', 'Movies', 'Colors', 'have', 'gone', 'past', 'Training', 'Day', 'different', 'films', 'head', 'shoulder', 'others', 'due', 'main', 'leads.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'plays', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'young', 'ambitious', 'cop', 'who', 'shot', 'high', 'profile', 'Narcotics', 'Squad', 'going', 'Training', 'day', 'Detective', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'tough', '13', 'year', 'veteran', '15,000', 'man-hours', 'worth', 'arrests', 'belt.Right', 'off', 'Hoyt', 'who', 'still', 'idealistic', 'given', 'harsh', 'brutality', 'streets', 'Harris', 'descriptions', 'events', 'such', 'seeing', 'girl', 'being', 'raped', 'street', 'However', 'plot', 'associated', 'movie', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'certain', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'figure', 'relationship', 'underlying', 'premise', 'whole', 'movie', 'dual', 'nature', 'Harris', 'character', 'came', 'sort', 'shock', '2/3rd', 'point', 'movie.Let', 'first', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Denzel', 'role', 'Rogue', 'Cop', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'win', 'done', 'better', 'work', 'movies', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Hurricane', 'However', 'strong', 'point', 'movie', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'ruthless', 'father-figurish', 'appeal', 'Hoyt', 'truly', 'wolf', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'scene', 'command', 'movie', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'natural', 'Hawke', 'character', 'learner', 'straight', 'man', 'get', 'lot', 'empathy', 'audience', 'needed', 'integrity', 'Hoyt', 'for.The', 'storyline', 'generic', 'well', 'filmed', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'previous', 'attempts', 'Bait', 'Replacement', 'Killers', 'were', 'failures', 'redeem', 'movie', 'evil', 'inner', 'city', 'streets', 'who', 'know', 'LA', 'movies', 'such', 'LA', 'Story', 'maybe', 'surprised', 'how', 'dark', 'City', 'Angels', 'can', 'be', 'movie', 'not', 'put', 'city', 'best', 'lights', 'Fuqua', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'dangerous', 'realities', 'LA', 'including', 'introducing', 'low', 'live', 'characters', 'such', 'Blue', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Smiley', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Crazy', 'Sniper', 'Raymond', 'Cruz', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'generic', 'story', 'predictable', 'ending', 'damper', 'movie', 'itself.However', 'want', 'see', 'action', 'movie', 'cut', 'rest', 'Training', 'Day', 'would', 'fit', 'ticket', '.Rating', 'B-Note', 'Harris', 'Hoyt', 'picture', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'However', 'picture', 'Nick', 'Styles', '.A', 'character', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'played', 'Ricochet']",N/A

His mentor, and mental abuser, is Alonzo. During the day Alonzo sets Jake(Ethan Hawke)up, holds a gun to his head and forces him to use narcotics that destroy his mind, and he makes him assist in murder and robbery. Alonzo teses him, plays with his mind, and puts jake way over his boiling point.In the end, Alonzo ditches Jake with a gang of Mexican hitmen, leaves him for dead, and goes back to his wife(Eva Mendes) and their son.Jake finds Alonzo, chases him to a rooftop, and they battle for control over Alonzo's ground.

His performance was so convincing one finds oneself being revolted by his portrayal. However, there was something that always brought me back to this movie, seeing it three times over. On my fourth viewing of the DVD, I listened to Antoine Fuqua's directorial comments of the film, and I was able to appreciate the film to a greater depth.The story itself is a study of the seduction of ambition and what one will compromise regarding personal morals in order to fulfill it. From the beginning of the movie at Jake Hoyt's residence, Jake comments to his wife about the possible advancement in the force this new position will bring and the material comfort it can provide his family. Before leaving his home and thus beginning his first day of training, his wife warns rather than encourages Jake not to screw up. Such comments sting the conscience of any one who seeks to provide the best for the family and one can sense the shame of past failures embedded in such a statement, making it all the more important that one will do what it takes to make it work. Picking up on Jake's enthusiasm and eagerness to please, Alonzo Harris, the veteran cop assigned to train Jake toys, manipulates, and pushes him beyond his own boundaries, and manages to force Jake to cross the line in order to prove himself.Alonzo himself though has crossed that line long before. When visiting the home of a drug dealer whom Alonzo has built a working relationship with, he comments on how nave and ignorant he was as Jake is now when he first started. Later on we see Alonzo seeking audience from three of his corrupt superiors, and it is he who becomes docile seeking to impress those whose worlds Alonzo aspires to enter.Altogether Training Day is a hard-hitting, thought provoking film that is extremely well acted and directed. The one point where the movie seems improbable is the bath tub scene, but it is through Antoine Fuqua's commentary that this turn of events is given some credibility to the scene.",3,A Study in Seduction,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,2170,"['first', 'seeing', 'Training', 'Day', 'was', 'disappointed', 'especially', 'seeing', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'playing', 'character', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'portrayed', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'one', 'being', 'revolted', 'portrayal', 'However', 'was', 'something', 'always', 'brought', 'back', 'movie', 'seeing', 'three', 'times', 'over', 'fourth', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'listened', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'directorial', 'comments', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'film', 'greater', 'depth.The', 'story', 'study', 'seduction', 'ambition', 'what', 'one', 'will', 'compromise', 'regarding', 'personal', 'morals', 'order', 'fulfill', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'residence', 'Jake', 'comments', 'wife', 'possible', 'advancement', 'force', 'new', 'position', 'will', 'bring', 'material', 'comfort', 'can', 'provide', 'family', 'leaving', 'home', 'thus', 'beginning', 'first', 'day', 'training', 'wife', 'rather', 'encourages', 'Jake', 'not', 'screw', 'up', 'Such', 'comments', 'sting', 'conscience', 'one', 'who', 'provide', 'best', 'family', 'one', 'can', 'sense', 'shame', 'past', 'failures', 'embedded', 'such', 'statement', 'making', 'more', 'important', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'what', 'make', 'work', 'Picking', 'up', 'Jake', 'enthusiasm', 'eagerness', 'please', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'veteran', 'cop', 'assigned', 'train', 'Jake', 'toys', 'manipulates', 'own', 'boundaries', 'force', 'Jake', 'cross', 'line', 'order', 'prove', 'himself.Alonzo', 'crossed', 'line', 'long', 'before', 'When', 'visiting', 'home', 'drug', 'dealer', 'whom', 'Alonzo', 'built', 'working', 'relationship', 'comments', 'how', 'nave', 'ignorant', 'was', 'Jake', 'now', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'Later', 'see', 'Alonzo', 'seeking', 'audience', 'three', 'corrupt', 'superiors', 'who', 'docile', 'seeking', 'impress', 'worlds', 'Alonzo', 'enter.Altogether', 'Training', 'Day', 'hard-hitting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'one', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'improbable', 'bath', 'tub', 'scene', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'commentary', 'turn', 'events', 'given', 'credibility', 'scene']",N/A

You wonder if maybe you crossed that line 30 minutes ago and didn't realize it.Hawke plays a rookie cop who is assigned to an elite narcotics squad of the LAPD, and Washington is the head of that squad, the cop who will train the new guy.  Hawke has one day to make it or break it.  The film is about that day.  Hawke being the rookie that he is, is a straight-arrow that wants to arrest every offender he sees.  Washington is the old timer with patience, who basically holds the new guy back - don't catch the little fish if they can lead you to the big ones.  Their relationship develops in a beatiful combination of police action scenes and wonderfully written dialog.  From the first moment, you are wondering if Denzel isn't a bad cop, but by the time you know for sure - Pow! - he's got you.What makes this film even more entertaining is that it is so obviously accurate and realistic, it makes &quot;Boys in the Hood&quot; look like fantasy.  If you don't like foul language, this isn't your kind of movie.  The locations are real LA ghettos, the people are real Crypts and Bloods.  Director Antoine Fuqua has many friends who are undercover narcotics agents, and thus has brought that knowledge to the film with intense authority. Denzel and Hawke also add outstanding performances which remind me that human nature is basic and universal to many people in many situations.

Thus, his entire speech to Hoyt (including the &quot;chess&quot; remark) was entirely two-faced.  He had already arranged Hoyt's murder at that point.  A deleted scene reveals he'd planned to murder Hoyt's wife and child as well, along with burning down Hoyt's house, all to make an example of him.  Of course, this makes me wonder (why didn't he let Dre kill the guy?).I don't know if I like Hoyt, but at least he stood for something when most of us would have folded.  I can almost understand Alonzo's point of view, and that scares me.  I suppose that's the point of the movie, though.  If we had just looked at the philosophy that Alonzo spouted, we could perhaps ride along.But it's his willingness to murder a fellow officer to keep him &quot;out of the way&quot; that shows us who Alonzo truly is: someone who lives by the street rules of &quot;look out for Number One.&quot;  His loyalty is only to himself and, to a limited degree, the people on his team that are just like him (as long as they assist him and go along with it).  He's not loyal to Hoyt, a fellow officer, to his wife, to his numerous illegitimate children, or to the welfare of others.  I don't know if he saw that girl being attacked by those crackheads, but I do know he felt it was a waste of time and resources to stop to help her.This movie has its heaviest impact in the first viewing, before Alonzo's flaws become apparent enough to discount his vocalized philosophies about the street.  After the first viewing, he looks more and more like a manipulative hypocrite, hard-talkin' but with no loyalty to others.",5,Alonzo's Philosophy vs. His Actions,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,2001,"['Denzel', 'was', 'incredible', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'truly', 'startled', 'movie', 'quot', 'chess', 'ai', ""n't"", 'checkers', 'quot', 'character', 'one', 'point.Of', 'course', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Alonzo', 'off', 'more', 'slimebag', 'urban', 'philosopher', 'Note', 'words', 'cell', 'phone', 'exiting', 'house', 'where', 'murdered', 'man', 'cold', 'blood', 'quot', 'make', 'sure', 'tub', 'clean', 'quot', 'Thus', 'entire', 'speech', 'Hoyt', 'including', 'quot', 'chess', 'quot', 'remark', 'was', 'entirely', 'two-faced', 'had', 'already', 'arranged', 'Hoyt', 'murder', 'point', 'A', 'deleted', 'scene', 'reveals', ""'d"", 'planned', 'murder', 'Hoyt', 'wife', 'child', 'as', 'well', 'burning', 'down', 'Hoyt', 'house', 'make', 'example', 'course', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'Dre', 'kill', 'guy', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'like', 'Hoyt', 'least', 'stood', 'something', 'when', 'most', 'would', 'have', 'folded', 'can', 'almost', 'understand', 'Alonzo', 'point', 'view', 'suppose', 'point', 'movie', 'though', 'had', 'just', 'looked', 'philosophy', 'Alonzo', 'spouted', 'could', 'perhaps', 'ride', 'willingness', 'murder', 'fellow', 'officer', 'keep', 'quot', 'way', 'quot', 'who', 'Alonzo', 'truly', 'someone', 'who', 'street', 'rules', 'quot', 'look', 'out', 'Number', 'One.', 'quot', 'loyalty', 'only', 'limited', 'degree', 'people', 'team', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'assist', 'go', 'along', 'not', 'loyal', 'Hoyt', 'fellow', 'officer', 'wife', 'numerous', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'welfare', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'saw', 'girl', 'being', 'attacked', 'crackheads', 'do', 'know', 'felt', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'resources', 'stop', 'help', 'her.This', 'movie', 'heaviest', 'impact', 'first', 'viewing', 'Alonzo', 'flaws', 'become', 'apparent', 'enough', 'discount', 'vocalized', 'philosophies', 'street', 'first', 'viewing', 'more', 'more', 'manipulative', 'hypocrite', 'hard-talkin', 'loyalty', 'others']",N/A

(One can immediately envision hordes of studio execs perusing the Training Day script and firing off hasty notes to the producer asking how they can sell the film if Washington and Hawke aren't riding off into the sunset together at the end.) Training Day, of course, is going for something grittier, but only partly succeeds. The plotting, unfortunately, still falls prey to hackneyed contrivances and coincidences required to push through to a pat resolution, just the sort of artifice that would be typical of a buddy movie, but here seriously undermines the authenticity that Training Day strives for. We overlook that due to Washington's performance, a body slam of arrogant bravado that's mesmerizing to watch. Washington plays a crooked cop who reasons with all the guile of a pimp, putting more spin on the dialogue than a pool hustler on a cue ball.

586234,A256F7E787F5SG,B00005JKEC,Christopher Nieman,"[2, 3]","I've probably seen a thousand movies about cops, and I'll probably see a thousand more. To my memory, some of the best portrayals of cops on the silver screen come from films such as ""Serpico,"" ""The French Connection,"" ""The Prince of the City,"" and ""L.A. Confidential,"" or even minor films such as ""Q & A"" and ""Year of the Dragon."" My ""favorite"" movie cops, so to speak, tend to be the ones on the edge of the law, or the force, or both.There was a fair amount of pre-release print devoted to this film, so of course I had very high expectations of Denzel Washington's character, who's an L.A. street detective always ""on the dark side of the force."" The parallels between Washington's Alonzo Harris and the real-life Rafael Perez (the LAPD detective notorious for his role in the Rampart scandal) are obvious. But what's most interesting about this comparison is the fact that David Ayer's searing screenplay was essentially completed long before Rampart became a synonym for police corruption. This is not just a story imitating history, but reflecting it directly. Ayer drops you headlong into the gutter to smell, breathe, and taste the world that ""Training Day"" brings, the blurred line between good and evil. Along with Antoine Fuqua's stylish direction and Mark Mancina's ominous score, this film doesn't just show you the streets ... it is the streets.The story introduces Alonzo in the most effective way possible ... by using Ethan Hawke's character Jake Hoyt as his ""straight man"" (and our moral center), so that as we are bombarded by Alonzo's extremely unconventional methods, Jake's reactions are also ours. In scene after scene, Alonzo's lesson is that in order to get crime off the streets, you first have to get close enough to it to make you a little dirty. Not surprisingly, Washington dominates the screen in every single scene, with language and behavior unlike most of the movie cops portrayed before him. Washington invests the character with one part depth, one part smarts, and two parts swagger, with a street-level expertise that is alternately impressive and repulsive.I was somewhat let down by the final 20 minutes, because Alonzo is suddenly made into an irredeemable villain, which cheapens the character, and we are supposed to accept what becomes of him at face value. Such a giftwrapped ending is in keeping more with Hollywood's peculiar white hat/black hat moral tradition rather than the harsh realities preached by Alonzo throughout the film. It looks like an ending decided in the production office rather than on the keyboard. A more ambiguous ending would have been more explosive in its own way, and I suppose that's why the break is so clean.Denzel Washington's second Oscar is well deserved. Alonzo Harris is one of the most unforgettable movie cops I've ever seen.

586242,A72S4SWJWIBCV,B00005JKEC,Cutre,"[0, 0]","Terrific movie. I can't say enough good things about it. Denzel Washington gives a superb performance as Alonzo Harris, an LAPD officer from the Narcotics unit who really has an attitude towards everyone who cross in his path. Ethan Hawke is Jake, the rookie police officer who accompanies Alonzo during this ""training day"". But Alonzo is not really interested in training this rookie, he's more worried about acheiving something Jake is not aware of. And Jake also doesn't know this Alonzo attitude may put his life in danger.Antoine Fuqua, the director of Bait, returns with a marvelous piece of a movie, in which he shows again that he really has the touch for this filmmaking stuff. We all know Denzel won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and even though I didn't even expect a nomination for him when I first saw the film, the truth is he really deserved this award.During the movie, we get to see the transformation of an everyday man, in this case, a police officer, to a desperate man ready to do anything to save his own (rear). In a style that somewhat resembles the 1993 film Falling Down, we accompany this guy on the downward spiral to a definitive conclusion and he doesn't care about bringing his parnter down with him. As the day is dying and the sun approaches the horizon, time is running out for Alonzo Harris and soon, Jake realizes he's the only one who can stop the selfish actions of his superior.But enough about all this, what are you waiting for? Get this one, a really good cop-movie. Great suspense, great acting and a very decent DVD edition. I think Warner is trying to make it up to all of us for those awful DVDs on those early 1997 days.",5,Smiles & Cries,1017878400,"04 4, 2002",2002,1688,"['Terrific', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'superb', 'performance', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'LAPD', 'officer', 'Narcotics', 'unit', 'who', 'really', 'attitude', 'towards', 'everyone', 'who', 'path', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Jake', 'rookie', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'Alonzo', 'training', 'day', 'Alonzo', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'training', 'rookie', 'more', 'worried', 'acheiving', 'something', 'Jake', 'not', 'aware', 'Jake', 'also', ""n't"", 'know', 'Alonzo', 'attitude', 'may', 'put', 'life', 'danger.Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'director', 'Bait', 'marvelous', 'piece', 'movie', 'again', 'really', 'touch', 'filmmaking', 'stuff', 'know', 'Denzel', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Leading', 'Role', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'expect', 'nomination', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'truth', 'really', 'deserved', 'award.During', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'transformation', 'everyday', 'man', 'case', 'police', 'officer', 'desperate', 'man', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'own', 'rear', 'style', 'somewhat', '1993', 'film', 'Falling', 'Down', 'accompany', 'guy', 'downward', 'spiral', 'definitive', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'care', 'bringing', 'parnter', 'down', 'day', 'dying', 'sun', 'horizon', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'soon', 'Jake', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'stop', 'selfish', 'actions', 'superior.But', 'enough', 'what', 'are', 'waiting', 'Get', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'cop-movie', 'Great', 'suspense', 'great', 'acting', 'very', 'decent', 'DVD', 'edition', 'think', 'Warner', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'awful', 'DVDs', 'early', '1997', 'days']",N/A

Although, I must point out that the acting was not the only thing this film had going for it.  The plot was spot on, the dialog was tight and Fuqua did such a kick@$$ job directing...he deserved an oscar nod there!  The film follows Alonzo Harris (Washington) as he trains rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke in his BEST performance ever).  The problem is that Alonzo's methods, while effective in their own ways, are not ethical to say the least, and throughout the 24 hour period Jake is subjected to too much, way too much.  One may start to question Alonzo's motives, and rightfully so.  As the film starts to boil down we see Alonzo's true charactor, his inner demons.  This is by far Washingtons best performance, a true gritty and real performance that left me jaw dropped...although he lacked the perfection that Crowe brought to the table with 'A Beautiful Mind'...alas...There are two scenes that prove Washington deserved his nod...his opening scene in the dinner was the best intro of any charactor in so long, it was spot on perfection.  And the scene in the car where he puts the gun to Jake's head and forces him to smoke the weed...he embodies his charactor, mind body and soul.

This describes perfectly how to be a good and a bad cop.Washington deserved his second Oscar win for his portrayal of a criminal police officer, an unusual role for him.  This proves that the brilliant actor has many more monumental roles in the future.  Ethan Hawke deserved his first Oscar nomination as a cop in training trying to do the right thing.  Hopefully, Hawke is seen more often in the future in roles like this.  Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray prove in ""Training Day"" that they are talented outside of music.The writers, the director, and the producers chose the perfect dark theme for this movie genre.  They make Washington's character's lifestyle as dark as it should be.  They desplict the drug houses and narcotic use as dirty as many of them are in real life.  They give Hawke's character the light that it deserves for being the good guy.

It's great to see him playing such a different  and interesting character instead of just another &quot;good guy role&quot;.While Denzel really steals the show here, Ethan Hawke turns in some excellent work as well. He plays Jake Hoyt to perfection and also appears to have a good understanding ofwhat the character is like. He's extremely believable as the young, some what naive, rooky cop who just wants to help people out and maybe bring a little recognition to his name in the process. There's great chemistry between him and Denzel too, best exhibited in the restaurent scene in the beginning of the movie. Some great work by both actors.The direction from Fuqua is great too. You can see that he's grown a lot since &quot;Replacement Killers&quot;. When I first watched the movie, I didn't really think the direction was anything special, but after I listened to the commentary, I developed more appreciation for his work. The story about how he was able to shoot scenes in the gang neighborhoods was especially entertaining.While the story isn't the most realistic one imaginable, it's still absorbing and doesn't follow the same old pattern and get boring like many other cop movies tend to do. The twists and turns keep coming, although they aren't as unexpeted to the viewer as they are to Jake. It's pretty easy to see the general idea of what's going to happen after a certain point, but's it's still entertaining to see how things unfold.The DVD features are decent, but they leave some stuff to be desired. Fuqua's commentary is good, but it would've been nice to see one from Ethan Hawke and Denzel too. The deleted scenes and alternate ending are all pretty good and so is the behind the scenes documentary. All in all, it's a pretty good buy.",4,Good DVD for a great movie.,1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,2384,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'role', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'being', 'familiar', 'work', 'thought', 'had', 'probably', 'turned', 'good', 'performance', 'When', 'finally', 'got', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Training', 'Day', 'quot', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'work', 'thought', 'awarding', 'Oscar', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'decisions', 'academy', 'had', 'made', 'year', 'Next', 'performance', 'quot', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'quot', 'probably', 'Denzel', 'finest', 'hour', 'Watching', 'movie', 'got', 'feeling', 'really', 'understood', 'Alonzo', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'saying', 'lines', 'drone', 'great', 'see', 'playing', 'different', 'interesting', 'character', 'instead', 'just', 'quot', 'good', 'guy', 'role', 'quot', 'Denzel', 'really', 'show', 'here', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'excellent', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'perfection', 'also', 'have', 'good', 'understanding', 'character', 'extremely', 'believable', 'young', 'what', 'naive', 'rooky', 'cop', 'who', 'just', 'help', 'people', 'out', 'maybe', 'bring', 'little', 'recognition', 'name', 'process', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Denzel', 'too', 'best', 'exhibited', 'restaurent', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'great', 'work', 'actors.The', 'direction', 'Fuqua', 'great', 'too', 'can', 'see', 'grown', 'lot', 'quot', 'Replacement', 'Killers', 'quot', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'direction', 'was', 'anything', 'special', 'listened', 'commentary', 'developed', 'more', 'appreciation', 'work', 'story', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'gang', 'neighborhoods', 'was', 'especially', 'entertaining.While', 'story', ""n't"", 'most', 'realistic', 'one', 'imaginable', 'still', 'absorbing', ""n't"", 'follow', 'same', 'old', 'pattern', 'get', 'boring', 'many', 'other', 'cop', 'movies', 'tend', 'do', 'twists', 'turns', 'keep', 'coming', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'unexpeted', 'viewer', 'are', 'Jake', 'pretty', 'easy', 'see', 'general', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'certain', 'point', 'still', 'entertaining', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'unfold.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'decent', 'leave', 'stuff', 'be', 'desired', 'Fuqua', 'commentary', 'good', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'one', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Denzel', 'too', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'so', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'pretty', 'good', 'buy']",N/A

But the rest of the film was more than excellent.""Training Day"" is the best of the bad cop dramas that I have seen, and I've seen a few.  Both Denzel Washington as the psychopathic bad cop, Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic rookie, Jake, were full out.  Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  The direction by Antoine Fuqua was superb.  The LA street scenes and milieu were as real and vivid as my old buddy Taco Bender.  (And trust me, Taco Bender was very real.)  The extras in the crowd scenes should get some kind of prize for macho scary.  I've been there, and I still have a few nightmares.  There are some streets in LA you don't want to walk down unless you are a homey, or a brother, and some other streets you don't want to walk down, period.Unlike some cop dramas and shoot `em up thrillers, this one was carefully planned, so that the scene in the barrio at the card table, the rook all alone set up for the kill, came across as real because what had happened before was just about the only thing in the world that could have saved him.  The LA atmosphere was like a rush, as stunningly authentic in a different way as, say, that in Chinatown (1974) or LA Confidential (1997), but more contemporary.I wonder how many guys starting in say the sixties or maybe a little before have experienced the kind of initiation that Jake experiences in terms of being fed some dope never before tasted and then ""led"" on the ""trip"" by someone wanting to exploit them.  Most of the time, for most guys it was an initiation into something other worldly, scary, but something that was only psychological and would be gone the next day.  For Jake it was a matter of, first, his livelihood as an idealistic cop, and second a matter of groking to a paranoid view of the world in which the good guys are the bad guys and everything is hopelessly corrupt and there is no good, only evil--and you just found out.  And third, a matter of life and death with either acid and grass running all around your brain or maybe PCP and speed, and some suddenly obviously evil person (as Washington so well depicted) giving you the kind of ""guidance"" you can't refuse.  And then finally it is beyond life and death and only a matter of primeval justice and a revenge you must perform.Look for Snoop Dogg in a wheelchair and Dr. Dre as one of Alonzo's posse cops.",5,Outstanding corrupt cop drama,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2731,"['Note', '500', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'book', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote', 'Get', 'Amazon', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'overkill', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'mano-a-mano', 'fight', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'drawn', 'out', 'too', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'excellent', 'Training', 'Day', 'best', 'bad', 'cop', 'dramas', 'have', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'psychopathic', 'bad', 'cop', 'Alonzo', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'idealistic', 'rookie', 'Jake', 'were', 'full', 'out', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'direction', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'was', 'superb', 'LA', 'street', 'scenes', 'milieu', 'were', 'real', 'vivid', 'old', 'buddy', 'Taco', 'Bender', 'trust', 'Taco', 'Bender', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'extras', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'should', 'get', 'kind', 'prize', 'macho', 'scary', ""'ve"", 'been', 'there', 'still', 'have', 'few', 'nightmares', 'are', 'streets', 'LA', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'walk', 'down', 'are', 'homey', 'brother', 'other', 'streets', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'walk', 'down', 'period.Unlike', 'cop', 'dramas', 'shoot', 'em', 'thrillers', 'one', 'was', 'carefully', 'planned', 'scene', 'barrio', 'card', 'table', 'rook', 'alone', 'set', 'up', 'kill', 'came', 'real', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'was', 'just', 'only', 'thing', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'LA', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'rush', 'stunningly', 'authentic', 'different', 'way', 'say', 'Chinatown', '1974', 'LA', 'Confidential', '1997', 'more', 'contemporary.I', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'guys', 'starting', 'say', 'sixties', 'maybe', 'little', 'before', 'have', 'experienced', 'kind', 'initiation', 'Jake', 'experiences', 'terms', 'being', 'fed', 'dope', 'never', 'before', 'tasted', 'then', 'led', 'trip', 'someone', 'wanting', 'exploit', 'Most', 'time', 'most', 'guys', 'was', 'initiation', 'something', 'other', 'worldly', 'scary', 'something', 'was', 'only', 'psychological', 'would', 'be', 'gone', 'next', 'day', 'Jake', 'was', 'matter', 'first', 'livelihood', 'idealistic', 'cop', 'second', 'matter', 'groking', 'paranoid', 'view', 'world', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'everything', 'hopelessly', 'corrupt', 'good', 'only', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'third', 'matter', 'life', 'death', 'acid', 'grass', 'running', 'brain', 'maybe', 'PCP', 'speed', 'suddenly', 'obviously', 'evil', 'person', 'Washington', 'so', 'well', 'depicted', 'giving', 'kind', 'guidance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'then', 'finally', 'life', 'death', 'only', 'matter', 'primeval', 'justice', 'revenge', 'must', 'perform.Look', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'wheelchair', 'Dr.', 'Dre', 'one', 'Alonzo', 'posse', 'cops']",N/A

The ""bad cop movie"" is nothing new having its roots in the fifties with films like ""Rogue Cop"", ""Pushover"" and ""Shield for Murder"" as prime examples of this genre but this film pushes it to a higher level.

The trailer I saw in the theatres made it look like a belated ripoff of The Corruptor, while director Antoine Fuqua's disastrous fumble with The Replacement Killers several years ago did nothing to boost my confidence.My doubts were dispelled the minute Denzel Washington looked up from his newspaper.  It is indeed good to see Washington, one of the most gifted actors of our time, abandon the saintly martyrs he's been prone to playing for 10 years and sink his teeth into a role which allows him to show a mix of deep charisma and dangerous viciousness.  That same alchemy had made his breakthrough performance in 1989's Glory  amazingly compelling, and in Training Day, there isn't a single moment where Washington is less than completely absorbing.  Ethan Hawke also gives the performance of his career as Jake Hoyt, an idealistic but easily swayed young cop who finds himself drawn into a web of corruption, violence, and twisted morals.Fuqua's directing is still overly stylish at times, but after a hyperactive first act, the film begins to roar.  David Ayer's script is dazzling, a combination of rat-a-tat street vernacular and relentless forward momentum, and after the midpoint of the movie, the intensity of the scenes would reach incredible levels.  And that's when Fuqua's show-offy camerawork finds a raison d'etre.  In this film, Fuqua even finds room for some comparatively simple scenes which are really like a breath of fresh air to his filmmaking -- for example, the &quot;you're a leader&quot; car scene, and that beautifully understated ending shot.  I hope he makes this part of his regular style, because there's only so much virtuoso camera one can take before it gets tiring, as is the case in the opening of the film.A white-knuckle thriller, well worthy of the accolades it received.

586264,A1JC2XJK39VM5E,B00005JKEC,"Dr. Braxy ""Brax :o)""","[7, 9]","I am a HUGE fan of Denzel Washington.  He has brought so much magic, comfort and love to the silver screen and has become a wonderful role model of what it is to be a man and a powerful actor.  Every role he has played, particularly as Malcom X, has shown us strength and an ever present honesty and decency even when he is playing a man with slightly tarnished morals.  No matter what, you always love Denzel and know it's him!When TRAINING DAY begins, we are introduced to Rookie Officer Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) and his wife; a very boring couple.  The pace of the movie is slow for the first 7 or 8 minutes as we meet them and find out our rookie is beginning his first day in the narcotics division of the LAPD; a really nice promotion.  And he must go to meet his supervisor for this training day at a local coffee shop.  And there he is.  In all his wonderful glory - Mr. Denzel Washington sits at the booth, looking fine as wine in all black, reading a paper.  You are in love again, as you were in every one of his moviesUNTIL....he opens his mouth to speak.And you suddenly realize THIS AIN'T DENZEL!!!From the very first line spoken by Officer Alonzo Harris, you will be uncomfortable, frightened, intrigued, amazed and stupified.  His deliciously evil way of speaking, looking and acting will have you spellbound and scared to death.  He is beyond mean.  And you immediately wonder how poor rookie Hoyt will ever survive the day with this crazy man.I found TRAINING DAY to be inventive and incredibly disturbing.  Yes, it has formulaic car crashes, violence and dialogue.  And the stereotypical latin and black criminals would seriously get on your nerves IF it weren't for the powerful performances by Denzel and Ethan.  This is a movie designed to showcase their acting ability and it does so in a powerful way.  But ever present is the underlying message that says this is how things actually are in many large urban cities.  As Alonzo says, ""To catch a wolf, you have to become a wolf"".  And that drives this movie and keeps your heart pumping at a mad pace till the very last line.  Halfway into the credits you'll suddenly realize it's over and stumble around wondering what kind of world are we living in.  YES, it will affect you like that!In TRAINING DAY there were many lines of dialogue that stuck in my brain; some funny and some wild.  But without doubt, the most powerful one came after rookie Hoyt discovers he has been played by Alonzo all day.  That Alonzo has been planning Hoyt's destruction from the beginning and he accuses Alonzo of this fact with such naivety and surprise.  Alonzo turns to him and says, ""[Expletive], this ain't no checkers!!  This is CHESS!!"".  Meaning, nothing in life is about fun, it is calculated and each move done to advance the desired end result.At the end of this movie, you will be wishing for - praying for - Officer Alonzo Harris to DIE!!  You will want that evil to be destroyed and for the rookie Hoyt to somehow get out of the web of evil spun for him by Alonzo.

Little does he know that Alonzo is so hard nosed, and that he joins in the drug inducing along with the creeps he is trying to bring down.Jake has quite a day with Alonzo.  Washington's Alonzo is unnerving but brilliant!!  He is one of the best actors and has my deepest admiration for going against the type of characters he usually plays.  It was very brave of him to take on this role.  I found myself shocked at some of the things the character said and did, especially since he is supposed to be a police officer, but I guess they aren't all so good, and Alonzo Harris is definitely one of the baddest cops to grace the big screen.  Although, I was so amazingly entralled by this movie, I also found it difficult to watch, but couldn't stop watching because it was just so darn interesting and intense.I found the acting all around was very good.  Denzel is so excellent in this.  He is such a talented actor, and I am glad he did this movie.  It really shows that he is not afraid to try any role that he finds interesting no matter how immoral that character may be.  I think it came at a good time.  He was always seen as the good guy; this proves to me that Denzel is a real actor who cares about the craft of acting.Ethan Hawke was also excellent in this.  Before this movie, I had only seen him in ""Reality Bites"", which was a comedy.Kudos to him for taking on this role!

In all honesty, does Mr. Washington want to be remember more for THIS role than he would the perceptive Ezekial Rawlins in DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS ... or the brave submarine commander in CRIMSON TIDE ... or the military officer trying to find a personal sense of purpose in death in combat in COURAGE UNDER FIRE ... or the Civil Rights leader in MALCOLM X?Granted, the AMPAS cannot undo history and go back to honor Denzel for roles that truly showed distinction, but we've seen the detective he played in TRAINING DAY in hundreds of other films, portrayed by hundreds of other gifted actors, in similar situations.  To award someone with the talent of Denzel Washington film's highest honor for such a stereotypical role is, perhaps, film history's greatest injustice.That said, the plot -- while predictable -- unfolds as the young recruit (played by the always-forgettable Ethan Hawke) realizes he's being used, rises to the occasion, and saves the day.",3,Is The Day Over Yet?,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,1435,"['One', 'can', 'not', 'certainly', 'argue', 'merits', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'performance', 'crooked', 'hard-hitting', 'cop', 'TRAINING', 'DAY.One', 'however', 'can', 'easily', 'argue', 'merits', 'not', 'performance', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'recognition', 'would', 'imagine', 'will', 'become', 'argument', 'ages.Is', 'truly', 'noteworthy', 'awardworthy', 'grant', 'one', 'cinema', 'most', 'gift', 'rightfully', 'revered', 'African', 'American', 'actors', 'distinction', 'playing', 'such', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'honesty', 'Mr.', 'Washington', 'want', 'be', 'remember', 'more', 'THIS', 'role', 'would', 'perceptive', 'Ezekial', 'Rawlins', 'DEVIL', 'IN', 'A', 'BLUE', 'DRESS', 'brave', 'submarine', 'commander', 'CRIMSON', 'TIDE', 'military', 'officer', 'trying', 'find', 'personal', 'sense', 'purpose', 'death', 'combat', 'COURAGE', 'UNDER', 'FIRE', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'leader', 'MALCOLM', 'X', 'Granted', 'AMPAS', 'can', 'not', 'undo', 'history', 'go', 'back', 'honor', 'Denzel', 'roles', 'truly', 'showed', 'distinction', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'detective', 'played', 'TRAINING', 'DAY', 'hundreds', 'other', 'films', 'portrayed', 'hundreds', 'other', 'gifted', 'actors', 'similar', 'situations', 'award', 'someone', 'talent', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'film', 'highest', 'honor', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'perhaps', 'film', 'history', 'greatest', 'injustice.That', 'said', 'plot', 'predictable', 'unfolds', 'young', 'recruit', 'played', 'always-forgettable', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'being', 'used', 'occasion', 'day']",N/A

If you are in love, that's great, but often it's just because someone is at least a bit intimidating.  Or very intimidating.  You find that avoiding an arguement with the person is more important than your lack of desire for doing the task.  Unless you are a total bully, we've all experienced this.""Training Day"" takes this to the extreme.  Ethan Hawke is on his first day with a special police unit that he wants very much to be a member of.  He very much wants to impress Denzel Washington, the leader of the group, but encounters problems from his first minute with Washington, and they only get worse from there.  It is the nightmare that unfolds that makes this well worth seeing.Cops are not choir boys, and the terrific new series ""The Shield"" points this out to the extreme.  When undercover cops work with trash, some of it is bound to rub off.  And I'm sure most of us would say there would be no way we would smoke a joint laced with PCP offered from the boss, especially on the first day on the job.  But where the movie succeeds in how the Oscar-winning intimidation by Denzel Washington makes it perfectly believeable that this could happen.Once that dirty deed is done, Hawke becomes almost putty in Washington's hands, and is taken from one harrowing situation to another.  You want to believe that some good will come of it.  After all, cops need to learn how things are done to effectively get their jobs done, and this sometimes means acting less than angellic.

I'd say his performance in ""Malcolm X"" is the finest, but here he gets 2nd place as a Los Angeles detective whose mind is more twisted than most. Ethan Hawke is the LAPD police officer who is being evaluated by Denzel; he gives a spectacular performance as well. It's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for it. The supporting cast (Eva Mendes, Tom Berenger, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, etc.) also do very well in the film.

Actually, I enjoyed the film, but this day of mayhem and corruption is so far from believable that it diminishes the film's value.One of the most important factors in a good cop film is realism.  It requires not just realistic guns, explosions and car chases, but realistic and authentic characters and a plausible story.  In this film, almost all the characters are way over the top.  Rookie director Antoine Fuqua brings great intensity to each frame from his music video experience, and most scenes have an imposing power that grabs the viewer and chokes off his air supply.  However, Fuqua's failing in this film is that of excess.  There are no moments of calm to create contrast.  The film is all storm.  It is well done, but exhausting.Denzel Washington is a great actor.  I say this without hesitation.  However, this is nowhere near his best performance.  He was far better in both ""Hurricane"" and ""Malcom X"".  He was robbed in 1993 when the best actor award went to Al Pacino for ""Scent of a Woman"" instead of going to him for his performance in ""Malcolm X"".  In ""Training Day"", Washington tries far too hard to be bad.  He overacts in spots and he is so intent on being forceful that he neglects character nuances, normally his greatest strength as an actor.  So, while I consider this to be a strong performance by any other standard, comparing Denzel to Denzel, this performance is just slightly above average.  This year, Russell Crowe got robbed.  However, Crowe won it last year despite the fact that both Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush gave better performances.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.Ethan Hawke was also nominated for his supporting role as Jake, and it was a nomination that was well deserved.  This is the strongest performance I can remember from Hawke.  His is the most credible and nuanced performance in the film, despite being in Washington's shadow.  He is helped, of course, by the fact that the character is the only one that is anything like a real person in the entire film.This is a vigorous film that never lets up.  The action and the psychological tension are first rate.  It is just too overblown to be real.  And to be great, cop stories need to be real.

While watching the movie I always got the impression that he was reading a script on how to be tuff and ruthless, but failed miserably at both.  It's one of those things that hard to explain.  Your facial expression, your body language has to sync with your speech when doing a play or performing on film.  It's akin to capturing the essence of the rage of an Inner City youth in all its nuance.  It would be difficult for an actor into Shakespearean play to try and pull off the street verbage of an Inner City youth- capturing the fire and the rage and still make it ""look real"".  By the same token, the reverse would be true if you ask the Inner City youth to do Shakespeare, while not being impossible, it would be difficult.  Denzel Washington receiving an Academy Award for this film and not receiving one for the film ""The Mighty Quinn"", is to stand justice on its head.  He was superb in that film - he lived the role.  The people in charge of award selections don't know what to look for in an actor who is to portray a tuff guy - they have their cliques and attend their champagne Holloywood parties, but the don't know ""Street"" the way I do -If you get my drift.

Washington was not a likeable partner and the opening training day got off to a rough start, which was exactly what Washington intended. Intimidation was the name of the game. When the intimidation got down to performing acts that were downright illegal, all in the name of fighting crime and putting criminals away in one manner or another, Hawke began to resist. The resistance led  to an outright  confrontation between about a half dozen so-called cops and brutal  violence ensued. It was not  a pretty story, nor was it particularly interesting.The action was brisk, the filming was good, the acting was good and the story moved right along.

586291,A367Q9VRWQZG7W,B00005JKEC,Gavin B.,"[4, 5]","There is an armchair casting director in all of us and we all imagine certain actors as naturals for certain roles. Alonzo Harris, the central character in ""Training Day"" is a corrupt, brutal cop who shakes down drug dealers, roughs up citizens, samples confiscated crack and has few slams of Jack Daniels in the morning to take the edge off. It's a role that seems beg the casting of Robert DeNiro or Sean Penn. The fact that good guy, African American actor Denzel Washington is cast as Alonzo Harris runs counter to casting stereotypes. Washington is amoral, predatory and ""one screwdriver short of a toolbox"", as he gleefully shows drug unit trainee Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) how to plunder and pillage the community he's sworn to protect. Washington clearly relishes the chance to play a throughly disreputable character and Ethan Hawke's decent cop becomes the reluctant straight man as Washington spins further and further out of control. The movie is laced with so much adrenaline that I felt exhaused at the end as if I had spent the day in training with Denzel's looney bird ""supervisor"".The direction by Antoine Fuqua is suitably cartoonish and he shows off his MTV video chops with; fast cut and double-take editing, loopy stoner camera angles and tight shots, jarring blasts of sound and hyperactive pacing. The script is contrived and the plot has enough holes in it to drive a paddy wagon through, but, hey man, this ain't ""Shakespeare In Love"" we're talking about here.

In his introduction to Alonzo, Hoyt immediately knows where he stands from a pupil to teacher perspective. Alonzo is a as ""type A"" as it gets and his rules/life are governed by a culmination of years steered towards the wrong path. Alonzo admittedly was like Hoyt; green and eager, but was led towards the faster and easier path to ""success"". His current situation (a little problem with some Russians in Vegas) was top priority and he would be very willing to use any resources surrounding him the remedy the problem.A key point surrounding Alonzo is that he never strayed from the actual truth (well at least until the end) spilling all the beans and harsh realities to the novice Hoyt. In one day Hoyt is taken to an unbelievable rollercoaster ride with the devil himself.Ethan Hawke plays very well in this role as the newbie Hoyt.

It is in it's own hemisphere. LA or Los Angeles is stunning. I'm tempted to think this is what is like or maybe it's just a film. I know in it's 2 hours - Training Day tried to show a certain half of a cop's life. Maybe all cops are this way and maybe they are not but I'm just left quite speechless at the perfromances.When the film started and the restaraunt scene hit me, I thought OK, This is interesting but soon just about every scene hits you when you're expecting. If someone falls asleep while watching this film, they must be nuts or on McDonalds.Ethan Hawke is brilliant. I don't know what happened to the man.The director is someone I've never heard of and I just searched the internet and found he's the same guy who did King Arthur and Tears of the sun. The latter I have not seen and the former's forgettable but I must get around to watching more films featuring the actor, the director and the same genre.I can clearly remember that the last film that shook me up just like training day did was a 2006 film that you clearly remember. And that was called ""RUNNING SCARED""I'm not quite sure which one I liked more but that is the magic of the best films. It becomes difficult to compare.To those of you who haven't seen this film as of yet, guys and girls, men and madams......this is it.

Actually, the movie deserves 0 stars in my opinion but Denzel Washington's brilliant performance made me change it. The 2 and 1/2 stars are all thanks to his performance and not this terrible movie. The movie is all about drugs and violence and corruption with plenty of cuss words to go along. You see, I had such high expectations for it and then I realized that this movie was a smart decision to make. Pay one of the best actors ever to carry the load and everyone will forget about the awful movie that talks about the same thing over and over again. Sure, I recommend this movie to everyone to see Denzel Washington's extraordinary performance but the movie is like Denzel's performance, only without the extra. It's a very ordinary movie about drugs, profanity, sex, and violence and all of the rest of stuff that America is into. Well this is what's in every movie and I've grown sick of it. Antoine Fuqua's plan worked, I'm recommending this movie to everyone, not because of the terrible movie but because of Denzel Washington's jaw dropping and amazing performance.

586307,A15QVPOYAV3U2T,B00005JKEC,"Ian Kiddo ""Ian""","[1, 2]","What I was most impressed with with this movie was the commentary by Antoine Fuqua. It is the perfect introduction to someone whose voice clearly shows that this is a man with a caring mind. On the contrary, I have done enough drugs (I'm now on anti-psychotics) that I believe we lose that voice the deeper we go into it. I'm out of touch. This guy simply wants to do his job, and I'm not sure he'd want anyone discussing whether or not he cares about people, but honestly, I think he knows it enough to set an example for people before they decide to make the mistakes I did. That is what he does extra. He didn't have to set an example, and we need people to come to terms with the problems drugs create. Sometimes we don't know these things until it's too late, after we ourselves have made the mistake of doing it. I've been in and out of the hospital for suicide attempts after hearing voices and finally wrote a novel that may publish. I have a lot of faith in the story, which is full of metaphors to my life, and I'd like to share it with people. It's emotionally charged. I believe people in this line of work agree that that is the route we need to go. I applaud the creators of Six Feet Under for their efforts in that, and of course after watching Training Day, my head turned in a new direction. All of it caught my attention and brought me to want change in my life so that I could bring change to others. I honestly felt closer connected to these people. I describe one of my lead characters in my novel as a sort of Ethan Hawke, and I did identify most with his character in this movie. Antoine deserved recognition here if through his work is the only way. I would imagine many people who know him take to his warmth, his honesty, and the charm he has as someone to care about, someone perhaps other than him who struggles. To be connected to people in that way is not an easy path. I don't have an easy mind to it, but at first glance I admit it seems important. I guess I can say this much: I didn't have the right friends to know what I was doing wasn't right, and to see someone who is doing the right thing really changed me. We are lucky to have these resources because in instances like this, these people are a true help. Before the suicide attempts, I had no friends because I was out of school and out of work. But if you're interested, I go by the author name Ian Bradley and am planning on publishing my first one soon. Editing is finished. Look for me sometime. Who knows, maybe I'll come back in touch with people and speak my mind enough that I may share what it is about and what meaning there is to take from it. Again, great that Antoine Fuqua worked with this story, it was great to watch, and the people in it in all their efforts really is admirable. I wish people wouldn't just go to be entertained. It's so ignorant of the larger picture. We need serious guidance. I would venture to say that it is God who graces us with men like Antoine. He has a strong personality and values that seem to match that.

586316,A1FGG93X6HT374,B00005JKEC,James O'Blivion,"[0, 0]","All right...let it be said first off...Denzel got the Oscar, and no one deserved it more.  In this film, Denzel proves that he can play characters who are FAR from being nice guys.  Generally, he plays wholesome (or at least semi-wholesome) characters in his films and has been regarded by many as a great actor who, unfortunately, takes ""safe"" roles.  Well, my God...if this film didn't shatter that mold, nothing ever will.  Denzel's Alonzo is a foul-mouthed, fast-talking, street-wise demon who runs wild with a gun and badge, abiding only the rules of the street.  As for the rest of the film, I loved it.  Not a bad performance in it, though Dr. Dre could have done better.  Powerful direction, strong cinematography, great script.  Yes, I know...there are always detractors out there.  Like the guy who says ""How do we know Denzel's a cop?  No uniform, never goes to the police station...how do we KNOW?""  Well...how 'bout that badge, smart guy?  He's a NARC, man!  Narcs don't wear uniforms...it would kind of defeat the purpose of undercover work, wouldn't it?  And as we know from the phone call he makes to Jake (Ethan Hawke) in the opening scene, Alonzo doesn't do roll call.  And then there are those who say ""He doesn't have to answer to anyone, man...who's gonna believe cops act like that?""  Well...me, for one.  This is the LAPD we're talking about...probably THE most corrupt police department in the country.  And he's a ranking detective with his own division...he can pretty much write his own ticket most of the time...cuz like he says, ""It's not what you know.  It's what you can prove.""  And I believe it was the same reviewer who said that Scott Glenn's character, Roger, was Alonzo's ""Mystery Friend,"" and we had no idea who he was until later in the film.  I think it's pretty easy to discern from his first scene with Alonzo and Jake that Roger's a retired (or at least NEARLY retired) Narc.  We know that from the introduction of his character, as long as we pay attention.  And although it all hits you really fast and seems fairly incomprehensible upon first viewing, the subplot with his character is astonishingly easy to follow when you give the film another look.  That's the thing.  This film moves so fast, it takes a couple of viewings for everything to sink in...after a second viewing, everything is much clearer.  Well, no matter what, have a go at ""Training Day.""  My advice is to watch it at least twice.

586317,A34CVPZ30BA4GD,B00005JKEC,James Robert Dator,"[3, 4]","'Training Day' is a very different film to what would fit into the ordinary ""buddy cop"" genre; this film presents a subversion of all that is sacred in the ""buddy cop"" film, and it pays off. Denzel Washington's performance is incendiary and gives the entire film a sense of class that was needed to make this film feel sophisticated, yet rough, while not falling into clich&eacute;'s.As the title suggests 'Training Day' is the first day for new cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) the character is set up as a young, idealistic rookie who's dream it has been to uphold the law. This character type is the exact opposite to his mentor Alonzo Harris (Washington) who is a veteran of the streets, a man whose street savvy is only rivaled by his pure vileness. The next 24 hours prove to break Jake down, confront his morals, and meanwhile feel a sense of duty towards his 'trainer'. The characters snake their way through corruption, drugs and a myriad of other situations on the mean streets of L.A.It is truly easy to see why Denzel won the 'Best Actor' Oscar this year. Normally the audience is used to seeing him in a protagonistic, good guy role. It was a huge risk for Denzel to present this side of his acting ability, and thank goodness he did. Alonzo is pure evil, who whilst both Jake and the audience can see his stilted moral views is oblivious to his own problems. As far as an antagonist goes it's the character that truly thinks they are doing the right thing that will appear more evil.Despite this Ethan Hawke's performance cannot be underestimated. It is the perfect supporting character that plays the rookie cop role perfectly. His reactions to Alonzo's actions are so truly believable the audience feels the emotions along with Jake, and it is here the film makes so many gains.In the fabulous direction of Antoine Fuqua the mixture of cop story, and hip-hop lifestyle is mixed perfectly. The two facets fit perfectly rather than seeming too separated. His use of time lapse shots at the beginning is a very effective technique as we are set up with a fast pace that is continued in depicting the entire 24 hours of the 'Training Day'. The camera work fits in perfectly is portraying the nitty, gritty world the film presents, and I hope to see more from this upcoming director.The DVD is one of the best one-disc films around. An amazing amount of features are fit into the disc, an HBO making of, Commentary, deleted scenes, alternate ending etc. make this the best way to fully immerse yourself in the film. As far as the transfer goes the picture on 'Training Day' is some of the prettiest on offer. It's crystal clear, as is the sound with every note of rap blaring from Alonzo's car radio sounding brilliant.'Training Day' is an amazing film, a successful subversion of the average cop film. The performances are fantastic, the narrative is tight, and slick, plus it's so easy to see why this film won Denzel his first best actor Oscar. This will be one for the ages, and must be seen by anyone who enjoys a very well structured film.",4,Denzel spearheads this amazing film.,1019520000,"04 23, 2002",2002,3051,"[""'Training"", 'Day', 'very', 'different', 'film', 'what', 'would', 'fit', 'ordinary', 'buddy', 'cop', 'genre', 'film', 'subversion', 'sacred', 'buddy', 'cop', 'film', 'off', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'performance', 'incendiary', 'entire', 'film', 'sense', 'class', 'was', 'needed', 'make', 'film', 'feel', 'sophisticated', 'yet', 'rough', 'not', 'falling', 'clich', 'eacute', 'title', ""'Training"", 'Day', 'first', 'day', 'new', 'cop', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'character', 'set', 'up', 'young', 'idealistic', 'rookie', 'who', 'dream', 'been', 'uphold', 'law', 'character', 'type', 'exact', 'opposite', 'mentor', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'Washington', 'who', 'veteran', 'streets', 'man', 'street', 'savvy', 'only', 'rivaled', 'pure', 'vileness', 'next', '24', 'hours', 'prove', 'break', 'Jake', 'down', 'confront', 'morals', 'meanwhile', 'feel', 'sense', 'duty', ""'trainer"", 'characters', 'snake', 'way', 'corruption', 'drugs', 'myriad', 'other', 'situations', 'mean', 'streets', 'L.A.It', 'truly', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Denzel', 'won', ""'Best"", 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'year', 'Normally', 'audience', 'used', 'seeing', 'protagonistic', 'good', 'guy', 'role', 'was', 'huge', 'risk', 'Denzel', 'present', 'side', 'acting', 'ability', 'thank', 'goodness', 'did', 'Alonzo', 'pure', 'evil', 'who', 'whilst', 'Jake', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'stilted', 'moral', 'views', 'oblivious', 'own', 'problems', 'As', 'far', 'antagonist', 'character', 'truly', 'are', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'will', 'appear', 'more', 'evil.Despite', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'performance', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'underestimated', 'perfect', 'supporting', 'character', 'rookie', 'cop', 'role', 'perfectly', 'reactions', 'Alonzo', 'actions', 'are', 'so', 'truly', 'believable', 'audience', 'emotions', 'Jake', 'here', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'gains.In', 'fabulous', 'direction', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'mixture', 'cop', 'story', 'hip-hop', 'lifestyle', 'mixed', 'perfectly', 'two', 'facets', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'rather', 'seeming', 'too', 'separated', 'use', 'time', 'lapse', 'shots', 'beginning', 'very', 'effective', 'technique', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'fast', 'pace', 'continued', 'depicting', 'entire', '24', 'hours', ""'Training"", 'Day', 'camera', 'work', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'portraying', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'world', 'film', 'presents', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'upcoming', 'director.The', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'one-disc', 'films', 'amazing', 'amount', 'features', 'are', 'fit', 'disc', 'HBO', 'making', 'Commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'etc', 'make', 'best', 'way', 'fully', 'immerse', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'transfer', 'picture', ""'Training"", 'Day', 'prettiest', 'offer', 'crystal', 'clear', 'sound', 'note', 'rap', 'blaring', 'Alonzo', 'car', 'radio', 'sounding', 'brilliant', ""'Training"", 'Day', 'amazing', 'film', 'successful', 'subversion', 'average', 'cop', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'fantastic', 'narrative', 'tight', 'slick', 'so', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'won', 'Denzel', 'first', 'best', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'ages', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'structured', 'film']",N/A

Yes, Denzel deserved the Oscar he is devious, sly, and psychotic. He is truly a wolf in wolf's clothing in this role. The viewer isn't quite sure what to make of Alonzo until far into the film. We know he's not good, but you'll never suspect some of the plot twists that turn up in this one. Ethan Hawke outshines Washington in the performance of his career, playing a naive rookie cop who is all but the anti-thesis of Alonzo Harris. Jake still believes that cops can make a difference and does his job to the letter of the law, in the end it's what winds up saving him. Training Day is a long film but the time is needed to unfold the multi-layered plot and adequately endear the audience to it's central characters.

586321,A2X5FCG9AUP9VP,B00005JKEC,jcphoenix,"[1, 1]","There are two kinds of movies. Plot driven movies, and character driven movies. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages, but it is usually clear if the movie works because of the characters or the characters work because of the movie. In this case, Training Day is definitely a character driven movie.Because it is a character driven movie, the main characters will be scrutinized by the audiences more than normal, and therefore take more skill to play. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke have both been scrutinized for their performances in this -and both are definitely up to the standard.More than ever, I was extremely impressed with the performance by Denzel Washington as Alonzo in this movie. The complexities of his character's personality are as many as threads in a tapestry, and each point is played to perfection by him. Alonzo is like a question mark, you never really know if he is as totally corrupt as he seems till at least halfway through the day. Many an actor would not have been able to convey this sense of indecision and especially this type of character well, but Washington has done it, and with a flair and life of his own. Alonzo was truly one of the most interesting characters I have had the pleasure of watching in a long time.Almost as impressive was Hawke's range in this movie as Jake. As a rookie cop with conflicting loyalties who questions the ethics of Alonzo, he puts in a stunning performance as well.The movie was definitely unusual and different from the normal cop movie. Don't expect a beat-em-up movie -this is a crime drama akin more to Soderbergh's Traffic, or Singer's The Usual Suspects than say Brest's Beverly Hills Cop or the Lethal Weapon series. The use of such a short time period (24 hours) as the backdrop was different to say the least, and put the entire movie into a new perspective.In those 24 hours, more happens than you could ever expect to happen in such a short time. Ethics and loyalties are questioned and answers are given before the day ends. Things happen at the beginning of the day that may have a large impact later on. Things that don't seem of much importance earlier are in fact of importance later.This is yet another example of a good script -turned into a great script by improvisation. Washington ad libbed many of his lines, and because of this, they have a much more natural flow to them, and he settles into his character much better.At the end of the day, when all is said and done, it all really comes down to one thing -ethics. Ethics was what started Hoyt on this trip, Hoyt questions certain ethics along the trip, and ethics is what ultimately incites the powerful and thought provoking climax by which time it is clear what sides everyone has taken on this issue.This film may have been directed by Antoine Fuqua, but it isn't his. At the end of the day, one man stole the show in this movie - and that one man without question was Denzel Washington.",4,An absorbing drama that will enrapture you.,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,2949,"['are', 'two', 'kinds', 'movies', 'Plot', 'driven', 'movies', 'character', 'driven', 'movies', 'have', 'own', 'advantages', 'disadvantages', 'usually', 'clear', 'movie', 'characters', 'characters', 'work', 'movie', 'case', 'Training', 'Day', 'definitely', 'character', 'driven', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'scrutinized', 'audiences', 'more', 'normal', 'therefore', 'take', 'more', 'skill', 'play', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'have', 'been', 'scrutinized', 'performances', '-and', 'are', 'definitely', 'standard.More', 'ever', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'performance', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Alonzo', 'movie', 'complexities', 'character', 'personality', 'are', 'as', 'many', 'threads', 'tapestry', 'point', 'played', 'perfection', 'Alonzo', 'question', 'mark', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'totally', 'corrupt', 'till', 'least', 'halfway', 'day', 'actor', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'convey', 'sense', 'indecision', 'especially', 'type', 'character', 'well', 'Washington', 'done', 'flair', 'life', 'own', 'Alonzo', 'was', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'long', 'time.Almost', 'impressive', 'was', 'Hawke', 'range', 'movie', 'Jake', 'rookie', 'cop', 'conflicting', 'loyalties', 'who', 'questions', 'ethics', 'Alonzo', 'stunning', 'performance', 'well.The', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'unusual', 'different', 'normal', 'cop', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'beat-em-up', 'movie', '-this', 'crime', 'drama', 'akin', 'more', 'Soderbergh', 'Traffic', 'Singer', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'say', 'Brest', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'series', 'use', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'period', '24', 'hours', 'backdrop', 'was', 'different', 'say', 'least', 'put', 'entire', 'movie', 'new', 'perspective.In', '24', 'hours', 'more', 'happens', 'could', 'ever', 'expect', 'happen', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'Ethics', 'loyalties', 'are', 'questioned', 'answers', 'are', 'given', 'day', 'Things', 'happen', 'beginning', 'day', 'may', 'have', 'large', 'impact', 'later', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'importance', 'earlier', 'are', 'fact', 'importance', 'later.This', 'yet', 'example', 'good', 'script', '-turned', 'great', 'script', 'improvisation', 'Washington', 'ad', 'libbed', 'many', 'lines', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'natural', 'flow', 'character', 'much', 'end', 'day', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'really', 'down', 'one', 'thing', '-ethics', 'Ethics', 'was', 'what', 'started', 'Hoyt', 'trip', 'Hoyt', 'questions', 'certain', 'ethics', 'trip', 'ethics', 'what', 'ultimately', 'powerful', 'thought', 'provoking', 'climax', 'time', 'clear', 'what', 'sides', 'everyone', 'taken', 'issue.This', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', ""n't"", 'end', 'day', 'one', 'man', 'stole', 'show', 'movie', 'one', 'man', 'question', 'was', 'Denzel', 'Washington']",N/A
586322,A1WIZ78S4T2AP2,B00005JKEC,J.D.,"[0, 0]","""Training Day"" was one of the more emotionally charged dramas I've seen in awhile. David Ayer's writing coupled with Antoine Fuqua's direction were very strong along with the two important pieces of the puzzle, Oscar-winning Denzel Washington and Oscar-nominated Ethan Hawke. Washington's performance was incredible. This guy can be the most likeable of protaganists and then be the antagonist you just love to hate. Washington is the villain in this movie, and he is one mean character. Hawke is making a name for himself, being able to hold lead roles and here complimenting a truly great actor.Washington plays Detective Alonzo Harris, a veteran cop who knows the streets - and literally lives by them and their rules. He is a corrupt cop with both ties nationally and inner-city gangs. Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a LAPD rookie who wants to become detective. Hoyt finds out with his first meeting with Harris that it will not be a usual first day. It will be a training day to remember. Hoyt and Harris' peronalities conflict greatly; Harris' believes in street justice while Hoyt is on the side of street protocol where suspects must be read their rights and give statements. That is not the life Harris lives anymore. The duo meets the Wisemen - three other corrupt cops high on the ladder, as well as stage a break in, which is actually murder. The movie spans the entire day, which in itself is tragic, terrifying, and confusing to Hoyt.Washington delivers one of the best performances in his career, well worth the Oscar. His character runs through emotions like colors of the rainbow, one time being receptive and proud, while next being punishing and unrelenting. Hawke also impresses as the ""good cop"" having no idea how life is on the streets. His performance was also worthy of his Academy award nomination. ""Training Day"" is a true drama, with suspense, action, and heated dialogue. It's ironic, though, because most of Washington's lines were ad-libbed. The only drawback of this movie was that it was too emotional. That's all the movie fed on for the entire feature - raw emotion. You can only have so much of that before you hit overload. That time comes when Hoyt begins to hunt Harris near the end. By then, it's just too much.""Training Day"" is a great film and was a surprise. Denzel certainly steals the show. Hawke also is great showing us how most of us would react to such a reality check that Hoyt gets. This is a very strong movie that solidified Washington as a truly great actor and is helping Hawke up the ladder to success.",4,Emotionally Charged,1022371200,"05 26, 2002",2002,2550,"['Training', 'Day', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'David', 'Ayer', 'writing', 'coupled', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'direction', 'were', 'very', 'strong', 'two', 'important', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'Oscar-winning', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Washington', 'performance', 'was', 'incredible', 'guy', 'can', 'be', 'most', 'likeable', 'protaganists', 'then', 'be', 'antagonist', 'just', 'love', 'hate', 'Washington', 'villain', 'movie', 'one', 'mean', 'character', 'Hawke', 'making', 'name', 'being', 'able', 'hold', 'lead', 'roles', 'here', 'complimenting', 'truly', 'great', 'actor.Washington', 'plays', 'Detective', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'veteran', 'cop', 'who', 'streets', 'literally', 'lives', 'rules', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'ties', 'nationally', 'inner-city', 'gangs', 'Hawke', 'plays', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'LAPD', 'rookie', 'who', 'become', 'detective', 'Hoyt', 'out', 'first', 'meeting', 'Harris', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'usual', 'first', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'training', 'day', 'remember', 'Hoyt', 'Harris', 'peronalities', 'conflict', 'greatly', 'Harris', 'street', 'justice', 'Hoyt', 'side', 'street', 'protocol', 'where', 'must', 'be', 'read', 'rights', 'give', 'statements', 'not', 'life', 'Harris', 'anymore', 'duo', 'Wisemen', 'three', 'other', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'high', 'ladder', 'as', 'well', 'stage', 'break', 'actually', 'murder', 'movie', 'entire', 'day', 'tragic', 'terrifying', 'confusing', 'Hoyt.Washington', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'well', 'Oscar', 'character', 'emotions', 'colors', 'rainbow', 'one', 'time', 'being', 'receptive', 'proud', 'next', 'being', 'punishing', 'unrelenting', 'Hawke', 'also', 'good', 'cop', 'having', 'idea', 'how', 'life', 'streets', 'performance', 'was', 'also', 'worthy', 'Academy', 'award', 'nomination', 'Training', 'Day', 'true', 'drama', 'suspense', 'action', 'heated', 'dialogue', 'ironic', 'though', 'most', 'Washington', 'lines', 'were', 'ad-libbed', 'only', 'drawback', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'emotional', 'movie', 'fed', 'entire', 'feature', 'raw', 'emotion', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'hit', 'overload', 'time', 'when', 'Hoyt', 'hunt', 'Harris', 'end', 'then', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Training', 'Day', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'surprise', 'Denzel', 'certainly', 'show', 'Hawke', 'also', 'great', 'showing', 'how', 'most', 'would', 'react', 'reality', 'check', 'Hoyt', 'very', 'strong', 'movie', 'solidified', 'Washington', 'truly', 'great', 'actor', 'helping', 'Hawke', 'ladder', 'success']",N/A

On his first day, he is forced to choose between his personal ethics and his career, maybe even his life, as events spiral out of control at a geometric rate.  Very entertaining, lots of action, great performances from Hawke and Washington - recommended.Extrapolated review; when `patrol fairy' Jake (Ethan Hawke) earns an assignment to the LAPD Narcotics Division, he finds himself sucked into a vortex of malfeasance that will force him to either abandon his personal and professional ethics or give up his aspirations not just of making detective but making it back home to his family that night.Lorenzo (Denzel Washington), Jake's new supervisor, immerses him into a what is essentially a boot camp of vice; from their initial exchange over the phone that morning he sets out to destroy all of Jake's previous notions of appropriate law enforcement technique and replace them with the unwritten rules of engagement his squad uses as modus operandi.  Thus it is that within minutes of meeting his new boss, Jake finds himself forced to smoke what turns out to be weed laced with PCP as one of many initiation rites.  That is probably the BEST thing that happens to him over the course of next twelve hours or so, because it's only downhill from there.The following hours are spent alternately committing and interrupting acts of street crime as the day increasingly spirals out of control.  It becomes apparent that Lorenzo has recently beaten to death an individual connected to a Russian crime family.  His attempts to assuage the men he must answer to in LA and placate the Russians as the chickens come home to roost lead him into more and more acts of desperation to save himself.Jake's attempts to control and minimize his level of participation in these events quickly put him at odds with Lorenzo and the rest of the squad and cause him to question whether or not they have set him up as a patsy from the start, or are they trying to quickly and inexorably engender him into the squad's corrupt machinations.  One option is as unattractive an alternative as the other as he tries to figure out how he can extricate himself from Lorenzo's grasp.All the deserved hype about Washington's Oscar-winning performance notwithstanding, this movie is more about Jake grossly overwhelmed by the combined pressures of being a white rookie narcotics officer in a minority community and being witness to/participant in more crime being perpetrated by his fellow officers than the criminals they pursue.  His day begins with dreams of a nice house for his family, but his parade of rookie mistakes combine with Lorenzo's manipulations to lead him to the brink of death; early in the movie he and Lorenzo briefly yet heatedly debate the merits of street justice, but by the end of his training day he discovers, as does Lorenzo that street justice is all that's left.***BONUS*** Fun cameo featuring Snoop Doggy Dog vomiting rock!

Cramer ""wazuppie765""","[8, 12]","Although much different from other cop moives, Training Day holds up on its own only by the fact of superb acting and a fresh script.The good things...-As I pointed out above, THE ACTING really shines here, as well as the casting. Denzel Washington, (he won an oscar for this film) Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, and many others make great contributions and deliver knockout performances.-The REALISM and the ACTION is great. This movie won't try to dazzle you with choreographed styilized action (like director Antione Fuqua's previous ""The Replacement Killers""). All of the action is this film is gritty, to the point, and very realistic. Also, the potryal of the gangs and street-life seemed accurate.And the bad things...-THE PACING is not very good. It takes a while to get involved in the movie and about an hour for the real action to start up.-THE DIALOUGE is shaky at times, and sometimes it's hard to figure ot what's happening and who doing what to each other, etc.-THE ACTING by some of the supporting characters are off. I'm not alking about the main characters, (like I was up above)but some additions like Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre just CAN'T ACT.Overall, the pros outweigh the cons in this one, but I expected this movie to be a little bit more exciting with more action.

music video-ish at times(Fuqua started out helming music videos) that doesn't ruin ""Training Day"" at all.The acting is over the top.Denzel Washington seems peversely tickled while playing the twisted,streetwise bad crooked cop Alonzo Harris.And Ethan Hawke's Jake Hoyt is played with a boyish innocence and adult knowingness.Also featured are Tom Bergenen,Dr. Dre,Snoop Dogg,Macy Gray(as the hilarious ""Sandman's Wife""),and .The hard-hitting hip hop soundtrack suits the film well.And the movie never really lags in terms of plot(although it might confuse you in one or two spots).Basically ""TD""'s plot consists of Hoyt's first day of training to be a narc cop.Hoyt's trainer is veteran Harris.Harris is a part of the drug and gang culture that he's supposed to be stopping.Harris' unconventional police tatics and dubious charm rub the naive Hoyt the wrong way.And it ends rather suprisingly.Yeah my summary may be flimsy but it wouldn't be right if I gave away the plot boilers and ending,would it? :-)To me ""Training Day"" was just a highly entertaining dark comedy.I thought it was hilarious for the most part.But then again I found ""Baby Boy"" to be a laugh riot so I maybe I shouldn't speak on that!(LOL) The movie DID give me a glimpse of the world of the many cops who get caught up in the game in some of America's toughest 'inner cities'.That was intriguing since you hear so much about the media.This film will open a lot of eyes,which it's meant to do.But it's not flawless...As expected by any film that focuses on African Americans or Hispanics(or any ethnicity of color) OR urban suitations,""Training Day"" is not without it's share of sterotypes.I'm sure Latinos are getting tired of seeing yet more Latino gangsters in chinos and tank tops spewing out ""Ese"" and threating to kill someone.And all of the urbanites in this film seemed to be malicious in some way.The film didn't bother to explore the 'good' people in these environments that are stuck in the shuffle or the vurnabilities of Alonzo.And the script seems weaker in terms of dialouge in certain parts.But that's not enough to turn your back on ""Training Day"".This is a hard hitting,eye-glueing film experience.Unlike other cop dramas/""urban"" action-dramas,""Training Day"" has a strong morality message as witnessed at the ending.Although it should be forewarned that this movie is ultra-violent and why the individual whom I viewed this film with let their young,under-12 children  watch this hyperviolent/profainity filled film is beyond me(And this same person made an effort to rid these same children of cable television of violent video games...).Anyhow,Denzel deserves props yet again for moving in a new direction with this VERY non-good man role.Many actors at his level wouldn't have taken that step.YOU will surely have your own opinion on ""Training Day"" but one thing is for sure you sure won't be bored.",4,A DARK COMEDY WITH A MORAL TO TELL,1030060800,"08 23,

586328,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B00005JKEC,JLind555,"[5, 5]","It's interesting how some of our best actors give some of their best performances playing thoroughly detestable characters.  It's as if they were able to tap into the dark side that lurks inside all of us in varying degrees, and play it to the hilt while enjoying every minute of it.  Richard Gere playing a venal cop in ""Internal Affairs"".  Ralph Fiennes as a loathsome concentration camp commander in ""Schindler's List"", and playing the ultimate bad guy as Harry Potter's nemesis Voldemort.  Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".  And now comes Denzel Washington, usually the squeaky-clean hero of whatever film he's in, giving a bang-up performance as Alonzo Harris, a LAPD detective who is rotten to the core.""Training Day"" chronicles one momentous day, from dawn to midnight, in the lives of two cops.  Jake Hoyt is a newly minted detective, anxious to make the grade in Alonzo Harris's elite narcotics squad, who takes ""Serve And Protect"" seriously.  He rides shotgun with Alonzo for the day.  Alonzo is going to break him in to what being a narcotics detective is about.  But Jake finds out that Alonzo has his own code that has nothing to do with serving or protecting, and everything to do with exploiting the people he's supposed to serve and protect.  He robs the dealers and steals their cash.  He breaks into people's homes with fake warrants.  ""I got 'em all under my thumb"", he brags about the inhabitants of the Los Angeles ghettos.  We soon realize that Alonzo's superiors have allowed him to do pretty much whatever he wants to do as long as he doesn't embarrass them by getting caught.  But Alonzo has his own problems, which require prompt resolution -- a very expensive weekend in Las Vegas left the Russian mafia into him for one million dollars, payable by midnight if he wants to live to see the dawn, and he's not past doing whatever he has to in order to come up with that sum, including armed robbery and homicide.Ethan Hawke gives the performance of a lifetime as Jake Hoyt, the idealistic, impressionable young detective who very soon realizes he's riding a tiger he may not be able to shake loose.  It can't be like this, he protests to Alonzo. But Alonzo responds, that's how it is; deal with it.  And Jake is left alone to somehow find his way out of this mess and salvage his own integrity in the process.Along with Hawke and Washington, some minor characters give some outstanding performances.  Chief among them are Scott Glen as Roger, Alonzo's erstwhile friend who has something he very much wants; Cliff Curtis, a hitherto unknown Maori actor from New Zealand who gives a devastating performance as Smiley, the Latino thug from the Hillside Trece gang whom Alonzo sets up to waste Jake, once he realizes there is a limit to his venality past which Jake refuses to cross, at which point Jake becomes a liability; Eva Mendes as one of Alonzo's four babymommies, and Cle Sloan as Bone, the South Central gangbanger who makes Alonzo finally realize that maybe he doesn't have them all under his thumb the way he thought he did.The film gets off to a fairly slow start but after the first fifteen minutes it hits warp speed and never lets up.  Antoine Fuqua directed a great movie that is a star vehicle for two outstanding actors.  It's an ugly picture, and we want to protest along with Jake that it can't be this way, but we have to agree with Alonzo that maybe, sometimes, it is.Judy Lind",5,Riding the tiger,1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,3451,"['interesting', 'how', 'best', 'actors', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'playing', 'thoroughly', 'detestable', 'characters', 'were', 'able', 'tap', 'dark', 'side', 'varying', 'degrees', 'play', 'hilt', 'enjoying', 'minute', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'playing', 'venal', 'cop', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'loathsome', 'concentration', 'camp', 'commander', 'Schindler', 'List', 'playing', 'ultimate', 'bad', 'guy', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'nemesis', 'Voldemort', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Dobbs', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'now', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'usually', 'squeaky-clean', 'hero', 'film', 'giving', 'bang-up', 'performance', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'LAPD', 'detective', 'who', 'rotten', 'core', 'Training', 'Day', 'one', 'momentous', 'day', 'dawn', 'midnight', 'lives', 'two', 'cops', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'newly', 'minted', 'detective', 'anxious', 'make', 'grade', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'elite', 'narcotics', 'squad', 'who', 'Serve', 'Protect', 'seriously', 'shotgun', 'Alonzo', 'day', 'Alonzo', 'going', 'break', 'what', 'being', 'narcotics', 'detective', 'about', 'Jake', 'out', 'Alonzo', 'own', 'code', 'nothing', 'do', 'serving', 'protecting', 'everything', 'do', 'exploiting', 'people', 'supposed', 'serve', 'protect', 'robs', 'dealers', 'steals', 'cash', 'people', 'homes', 'fake', 'warrants', 'got', 'thumb', 'inhabitants', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'ghettos', 'soon', 'realize', 'Alonzo', 'superiors', 'have', 'allowed', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'do', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'embarrass', 'getting', 'caught', 'Alonzo', 'own', 'problems', 'require', 'prompt', 'resolution', 'very', 'expensive', 'weekend', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'left', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', 'payable', 'midnight', 'live', 'see', 'dawn', 'not', 'past', 'doing', 'whatever', 'order', 'come', 'up', 'sum', 'including', 'armed', 'robbery', 'homicide.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'idealistic', 'impressionable', 'young', 'detective', 'who', 'very', 'soon', 'riding', 'tiger', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'shake', 'loose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Alonzo', 'Alonzo', 'how', 'deal', 'Jake', 'left', 'alone', 'somehow', 'find', 'way', 'mess', 'salvage', 'own', 'integrity', 'process.Along', 'Hawke', 'Washington', 'minor', 'characters', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Chief', 'are', 'Scott', 'Glen', 'Roger', 'Alonzo', 'erstwhile', 'friend', 'who', 'something', 'very', 'much', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'hitherto', 'unknown', 'Maori', 'actor', 'New', 'Zealand', 'who', 'devastating', 'performance', 'Smiley', 'Latino', 'thug', 'Hillside', 'Trece', 'gang', 'whom', 'Alonzo', 'up', 'waste', 'Jake', 'once', 'limit', 'venality', 'Jake', 'cross', 'point', 'Jake', 'liability', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'one', 'Alonzo', 'four', 'babymommies', 'Cle', 'Sloan', 'Bone', 'South', 'Central', 'gangbanger', 'who', 'Alonzo', 'finally', 'realize', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'have', 'thumb', 'way', 'thought', 'did.The', 'film', 'off', 'fairly', 'slow', 'start', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'warp', 'speed', 'never', 'up', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'directed', 'great', 'movie', 'star', 'vehicle', 'two', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'ugly', 'picture', 'want', 'protest', 'Jake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'way', 'have', 'agree', 'Alonzo', 'maybe', 'sometimes', 'Lind']",N/A

It also has Denzel Washington playing a villain and he does so very convincingly.Up until this film, most of Washington's roles were as good-guy as Tom Selleck's fare...and Denzel Washington has the good looks and charm to pull off all those good guy roles. Here he's hard edged and viscious as a cop who's crossed over the line.Washington is Alonzo Harris, the training officer to Jake (Ethan Hawke) a rookie entering the Narcotics Unit of the L.A.P.D. Ethan Hawke is excellent as the naive recruit who gets an extremely harsh dose of reality.The story is down and dirty and the characters are not only sharply defined but vividly real as well. The story is as brutal as a train wreck and just as gripping. You just can't help but rubberneck.I saw this in the theater and was glad that Washington got the Oscar for this role. He was excellent in Malcolm X, but that was a character he didn't have to invent. Lee followed Alex Haley's biography in every detail and Washington had reels of archive film of Malcolm X to work off of.

Within minutes after it starts Training Day is dominated by Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance as OfficerAlonzo Harris. Take a deep breath (you'll need it) and get ready to watch a film peppered with non-stop action, gritty settings, escalating violence, and surprising plot twists. Directed at break-neck pace by Antoine Fuqua,  Training Day has flaws (some plot holes and coincidences), but it works due to Washington's type-shattering performance.Let's face it: if ever Hollywood had a ""good guy"" who audiences LIKED because he seemed like an old friend and NICE guy, it has been Denzel Washington. Forget all the press hype about political and personal factors influencing the Oscar vote: when you see Training Day you'll witness evil incarnate as you watch Washington's portrayal of the corrupt, manipulative and brutal Officer Harris -- providing evidence beyond a doubt that Washington is one of today's greatest actors.The setting is Los Angeles (one of the biggest stars of this movie) where crooked narc Harris must train his new rookie, star-eyed partner, Jake, played by  Ethan Hawke in a career-boosting role. Hawke creates the perfect conscience-ridden counterpoint to Washington's amoral, immoral Harris. Indeed, Hawke's finely-tuned performance, making Jake increasingly sympathetic and complex,  provides a glaring context for Harris' evil.Bit by bit, the naive, idealistic Jake is shoved down and force-fed street-reality by the cynical, sociopathic Harris. You can literally feel Hawke's rookie struggling with how criminal and law enforcement distinctions increasingly blur. By the end of this film, Jake seems ""older"" while the steely Harris' seems a mere street thug...but get ready for some surprises.Aside from Washington's and Hawke's on-the-edge performances, Training Day boasts several jarring and highly satisfying plot twists. Don't expect a mere police dramawith lots of chases, screeching tires and nothing more.

He manages to hold on to a little nobility even when he's at his sleaziest (note the way he scruffs his boys head during a 'break').

The society at large (trust me) has no idea of what inner city realities really are.  So for those who are so uninformed and have no experience upon which to form a sound opinion they would do better just to remain silent.As much as i've marveled at Denzel's range I felt that this was BY FAR the best performance of his illustrious career.  He was utterly transformed.  I am more amazed that the Academy would give him the award for this obviously negative portrayal of a police officer.The film is filled with surprises.  And I would agree that the film starts out spectacularly.  The coffee shop scene really made me sit up and take notice.  That and the card game to me were the best scenes in the film.  However, some of it seemed a bit too improbable to be believed.  Nonetheless, the film was (overall) brutally honest and raw.  Throw in some great cameo appearances and pretty credible performances by those performers as well and you get a quality, if not perfect, film.And please keep in mind that just as Ethan Hawke's character has to really wake up to the realities of the streets so does most of the viewing public.  It's not Disneyland out there.  Despite what you may think.  To me Hawke's performance really makes the film so honest.

But mostly rant.I had absolutely no desire to see &quot;Training Day.&quot; Nothing about the previews appealed to me. The word-of-mouth from friends was... Well, they mostly bad-mouthed the movie, as they were at a loss to understand why so much praise had been heaped on this far-fetched &quot;cartoon.&quot;But I decided to see for myself and pay the rental fee at Blockbuster. Thank heavens I didn't waste my hard-earned dollars buying the DVD because having seen the movie once, I have no desire to see it again.For the record, I admire Denzel Washington -- certainly one of our greatest actors. I found his performance in &quot;Philadlephia&quot; absolutely reviting -- as Oscar-worthy as Tom Hanks'. Of course, 1993 was a banner year for the Best Actor category, with Liam Neeson in &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and the overlooked Kevin Costner in the terribly under-appreciated &quot;A Perfect World.&quot;So, my main interest in &quot;Training Day&quot; was seeing the performance judged superior, by the Academy Award voters, to Russell Crowe's in &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot; Crowe's portrayal of John Nash was brilliant -- tormented, arrogant, pitiful. And he ages 40 years in the course of the film.Now I don't know a thing about Russell Crowe the man, but his work in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; was astonishing. Truly one of the greatest performances I've ever experienced.I'm afraid the 2001 Oscar race for Best Actor was a popularity contest, with the final decision based more on the actor's personalities instead of their performances. It was Denzel's time, his turn, whatever.Sadly, that his moment of triumph would be associated with &quot;Training Day&quot; only adds more tarnish to the Academy Awards, ranking right up there -- or down there? -- with other Oscar travesties such as &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot; over &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; or, for that matter, Crowe for &quot;Gladiator&quot; over Hanks in &quot;Castaway.&quot;I actually found myself snickering through much of &quot;Training Day,&quot; which stretches your willing suspension of disbelief with a series of ridiculous violent confrontations and implausible coincidences, then snaps it with an utterly unconvincing, completely outrageous climatic fight scene. Apparently, Ethan Hawke's rookie detective could fly.How can some call this movie gritty and realistic?Which brings me back to my BIG RANT about &quot;Training Day.&quot; Denzel Washington's character is representative of the entire movie: Over the top . . . overhyped . . . overrated . . . totally lacking subtlety . . .His performance seemed so forced, inappropriately silly rather than sinister.As for the director, he obviously held the reins loose throuhgout the film, but he should have definitely pulled them in during that ludicrous third act.&quot;Training Day&quot; is a definite rent-first, buy-later DVD. I don't regret renting it.

While watching the film, I kept thinking that Samuel Jackson should have gotten this role. But Denzel adds a level of professionalism and class to this role of an out of control LA Police vice detective that Jackson likely could likely not have pulled off.  You know, from Jackson's previous roles in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, that Jackson plays a ""bad guy"" very well, and without a doubt.  Washington, on the other hand, is far more stealthy regarding character judgement.  The movie Flight is a good example of this.  He starts out as this wonderful ""hero pilot"", and ends up as a model prisoner, all because of his own bad behavior,.  This bad behavior sneaks up on the viewer, and is certainly not ""in your face"" the way Jackson has played his roles.  As Training Day gets going, one does not know what to make of Washington's character, and neither does his newly hired police partner.  One wonders if the experienced detective (with 15,000 convictions) is going to be a positive role model for the newbie police officer, or is he actually a corrupt demon, which he clearly becomes by the end of the film.  A very good film, that I don't particularly want to see again.  It can be frightening to the viewer to see the subtle ambiguities that separate right from wrong.  Washington again demonstrates his superior skills in this regard on the big screen.  His acting abilities right now reminds me of a young Robert DeNiro.  This film reminds me of Taxi Driver.  In both films, the main character travels between ""good"" and ""evil"" with stealth and subtlety, and there are not many actors who can pull this off.",4,Denzel plays Samuel like DeNiro,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,1712,"['Overall', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'truly', 'character', 'role', 'played', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'watching', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'role', 'Denzel', 'level', 'professionalism', 'class', 'role', 'control', 'LA', 'Police', 'vice', 'detective', 'Jackson', 'likely', 'could', 'likely', 'not', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'know', 'Jackson', 'previous', 'roles', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'Jackson', 'bad', 'guy', 'very', 'well', 'doubt', 'Washington', 'other', 'hand', 'far', 'more', 'stealthy', 'regarding', 'character', 'judgement', 'movie', 'Flight', 'good', 'example', 'out', 'wonderful', 'hero', 'pilot', 'up', 'model', 'prisoner', 'own', 'bad', 'behavior', 'bad', 'behavior', 'up', 'viewer', 'certainly', 'not', 'face', 'way', 'Jackson', 'played', 'roles', 'Training', 'Day', 'going', 'one', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Washington', 'character', 'neither', 'newly', 'hired', 'police', 'partner', 'One', 'experienced', 'detective', '15,000', 'convictions', 'going', 'be', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'newbie', 'police', 'officer', 'actually', 'corrupt', 'demon', 'clearly', 'end', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'can', 'be', 'frightening', 'viewer', 'see', 'subtle', 'ambiguities', 'separate', 'right', 'wrong', 'Washington', 'again', 'superior', 'skills', 'regard', 'big', 'screen', 'acting', 'abilities', 'right', 'now', 'young', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'film', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'films', 'main', 'character', 'travels', 'good', 'evil', 'stealth', 'subtlety', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'pull', 'off']",N/A

So many of the reviews were slanted toward whether Denzel's performance was worthy of an Oscar. It wasn't.  I was too bent out of shape of Billy Bob Thornton not even being nominated for Monsters Ball to get involved.  After watching a pretty great film, it wasn't Denzel's best, but certainly that shouldn't stop anyone from seeing the film.  That having been said, we can move on.It was interesting to see Denzel stretch his acting ability to at least the 'darker' side of man.  The premise of the movie was interesting and somewhat disconcerting, especially to someone with police personnel in their family and social circle.  The supporting cast was very believable and the on-location filming lent an air of real grit and believability to this film.I am way over the age-limit some of the reviewers were suggesting for this film and I am of the wrong gender based on many reviews.  However, I want to enourage older viewers and those of the female persuasion to give this film a chance.Further, I strongly recommend watching the DVD versus VHS.  The 'director's commentary' covering the entire film was mesmerizing and very informative.  I wish all DVDs would offer this awesome type of inside information from the film's director.

He sells this guy to perfection, or whatever the opposite of that is. Along with a fine script that's all too believable, and some tight direction, he takes this flick into places few Hollywood movies dare go. Hawke's Serpico Jr. is at his best in the kitchen/bathtub scene, a true classic; those are some good bad guys, ese.The blu-ray features a good transfer and a nice little doc on the film as well as 12 minutes of occasionally great deleted scenes, a few of which should have stayed in the movie, the beer scene especially. Also included is a crisp commentary by director Fuqua that answers lots of questions, and poses a few more.The only niggles in Training Day are a few weak continuity moments, like the three bullet holes in the back window.

586356,A2ICI500LRO01K,B00005JKEC,Kyle Wells,"[0, 0]","""Training Day"" is a film that takes any preconceived notions that you had about the buddy cop film and rips them to shreds. Not that this film was ever trying to be or ever seen as a ""buddy cop"" film but something about the movie still seems to go against every other cop film we have seen. It contains the themes and ideas of such gritty, realistic cop films as ""Serpico"" and ""The French Connection"" but manages to kick it up another notch.The film follows the first day on the job of a rookie cop in LA, played very well by Ethan Hawke. For his first day on the job he is going to be riding around with an old pro of the area called Alonso who is played by Denzel Washington in one of his best roles in a long time. Sounds pretty standard so far and with that description one might decide to settle in for a two hour film of the old pro teaching the hot headed rookie a thing or two while they solve a case. Don't count on it. Alonzo is about to take Hawke's character straight into to bowels of LA and show him that Alonzo is worse than most of the hardened criminals on the street. The entire film takes place on this first ""training day"" and the amount of stuff that happens to Hawke's character is amazing. I won't say all that happens but it is a hell of a first day.The film works because it is great on many differant levels, the first of which is the screenplay. It is a great story with rich and vibrant characters that take some standard cliches, such as the dirty cop and the new guy, to the absolute extreme. Through their actions and conversations we slowly see the ins and outs of these characters and by the end of the film we can finally see what they are all about. Also the plot itself is great with everything from intense standoffs to exciting gun fights to revealing conversations. The second great thing about the movie is the acting. Ethan Hawke is great as the new guy. He adds a subtle side to his character and he is a pleasure to watch as he tries to comprehend the world that he has just been thrown into. Washington comes to the screen as a corrupt, fast talking hustler with a secret side to him and we can't help but believe every minute of it. This is his best role since ""The Hurricane"" and the Oscar was richly deserved.The last great thing about this movie is the directing. The film feels gritty and the colouring is great. There  is a certain amount of style added to the film that raises the film from good to great. There is an obvious sense of story and character here and it is this sense that ties the whole film together and makes it work.Not an absolute masterpiece but still a very exciting and extremely interesting film that feels very fresh and original.

586360,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKEC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","I have no problem with Denzel Washington receiving the Oscar for ""Training Day,"" because the history of the Academy Awards is filled with winners who were probably being honored for a body of work rather (e.g., John Wayne, Henry Fonda) or making up for an earlier snub (e.g., Jimmy Stewart, Al Pacino) than a career best performance (e.g., Yul Brynner, F. Murray Abraham).  All of this is certainly debatable but Washington's performance as Detective Alonzo Harris, the philosophical narcotics detective who is teaching the rules of the street to wannabe detective Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is certainly a solid characterization.  How memorable you consider it probably has to do with you are a fan of Washington or the genre; for the former, this is a radical departure for the actor that standard in marked contrast to everything he has done to date, but for the latter the most significant different would be that this time the younger cop is being taught by an older cop who happens to be black.The strength of the film is not so much Washington's performance as it is the way both the character of Jake and the audience are put in the perspective of wondering how much of Alonzo's ""training"" is legit, and how much is some sort of put-on, ruse, or test for the rookie.  Early on it becomes clear that Jake has no clue as to what is really going on, and neither do we.  Jake is a bit too nave at the start, especially if he thinks a drug dealer is going to let him refuse an offer to toke up, but no matter how much he knows he would clearly be in over his head before long as Alonzo laws down his personal blend of street justice and economic opportunity.  Screenwriter David Ayer is definitely comfortable in this genre, having deal with undercover cops in both his previous film, ""The Fast and the Furious,"" and the upcoming ""Dark Blue,"" but there is one thing that I think constitutes a glaring error in the film, which really got in the way of my enjoying the final act.I think that anybody who has watched a moderate amount of cop shows on television or seen their fair share of movies about cops during their jobs, knows what happens to a cop who shoots somebody.  Well, that does not happen in this film.  In fact, one of Alonzo's boasts is that he and his men are protected by their captain from such legal inconveniences.  Of course, if they follow standard procedure then the rest of the film does not happen, so Ayer take what I consider a rather large liberty with the real world because with the multi-million dollar lawsuits waiting around every corner I cannot believe there is a major police force in the country that does not cover its rear ends completely on officer involved shootings, no matter who the victim happens to be.Of course, this might just be me, and you can certainly see this plot element as a speed bump rather than a major roadblock.  When we get to the climax of ""Training Day"" the big question is what is going to happen and who is going to be left standing.  In a film like this, given the strong acting performances by both of the main characters, I cannot imagine what more your little heart could desire.",4,Denzel Washington dances with his dark side for an Oscar,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,3148,"['have', 'problem', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'receiving', 'Oscar', 'Training', 'Day', 'history', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'filled', 'winners', 'who', 'were', 'probably', 'being', 'honored', 'body', 'work', 'rather', 'e.g.', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'making', 'up', 'earlier', 'snub', 'e.g.', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'career', 'best', 'performance', 'e.g.', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'certainly', 'debatable', 'Washington', 'performance', 'Detective', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'philosophical', 'narcotics', 'detective', 'who', 'teaching', 'rules', 'street', 'wannabe', 'detective', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'certainly', 'solid', 'characterization', 'How', 'memorable', 'consider', 'probably', 'do', 'are', 'fan', 'Washington', 'genre', 'former', 'radical', 'departure', 'actor', 'standard', 'marked', 'contrast', 'everything', 'done', 'date', 'latter', 'most', 'significant', 'different', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'younger', 'cop', 'being', 'taught', 'older', 'cop', 'who', 'be', 'black.The', 'strength', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Washington', 'performance', 'way', 'character', 'Jake', 'audience', 'are', 'put', 'perspective', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'Alonzo', 'training', 'legit', 'how', 'much', 'sort', 'put-on', 'ruse', 'test', 'rookie', 'Early', 'clear', 'Jake', 'clue', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'neither', 'do', 'Jake', 'bit', 'too', 'nave', 'start', 'especially', 'drug', 'dealer', 'going', 'let', 'refuse', 'offer', 'toke', 'up', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'clearly', 'be', 'head', 'before', 'long', 'Alonzo', 'laws', 'down', 'personal', 'blend', 'street', 'justice', 'economic', 'opportunity', 'Screenwriter', 'David', 'Ayer', 'definitely', 'comfortable', 'genre', 'having', 'deal', 'undercover', 'cops', 'previous', 'film', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'upcoming', 'Dark', 'Blue', 'one', 'thing', 'think', 'glaring', 'error', 'film', 'really', 'got', 'way', 'enjoying', 'final', 'act.I', 'think', 'anybody', 'who', 'watched', 'moderate', 'amount', 'cop', 'shows', 'television', 'seen', 'fair', 'share', 'movies', 'cops', 'jobs', 'what', 'cop', 'who', 'somebody', 'Well', 'not', 'happen', 'film', 'fact', 'one', 'Alonzo', 'boasts', 'men', 'are', 'protected', 'captain', 'such', 'legal', 'inconveniences', 'course', 'follow', 'standard', 'procedure', 'then', 'rest', 'film', 'not', 'happen', 'Ayer', 'take', 'what', 'consider', 'rather', 'large', 'liberty', 'real', 'world', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'lawsuits', 'waiting', 'around', 'corner', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'major', 'police', 'force', 'country', 'not', 'cover', 'rear', 'ends', 'completely', 'officer', 'involved', 'shootings', 'matter', 'who', 'victim', 'be.Of', 'course', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'plot', 'element', 'speed', 'bump', 'rather', 'major', 'roadblock', 'When', 'get', 'climax', 'Training', 'Day', 'big', 'question', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'left', 'standing', 'film', 'given', 'strong', 'acting', 'performances', 'main', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'what', 'more', 'little', 'heart', 'could', 'desire']",N/A

Jake is to be trained by veteren narcotics squad supervisor Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Almost immediately, the viewer discerns that Jake's training day will be unlike any other day he has ever had.Alonzo is an unbelievably corrupt cop, a once good cop who has lost his way. He now corrupts those cops who come under his command, all for one and one for all. Jake, the newcomer to the group, still innocent and wide eyed about his reasons for being a cop, will be a test of Alonzo's ability to corrupt the seemingly incorruptible. A series of trials and tribulations await Jake that day, situations that in his wildest imagination he could never have envisioned, all of them fiendishly and cleverly engineered by Alonzo. All of them insidious. All of them criminal. The only question is whether good will overcome evil.Denzel Washington gives a performance of a lifetime and is certainly worthy of his Academy Award for Best Actor. He is at once both repelling and ingratiating as the character Alonzo Harris. His performance is charismatic, commanding, compelling, and completely mesmerizing as the narcotics commanding officer who has gone over the deep end and crossed a line that, once crossed, is final. Alonzo rules his territory and those within it with an iron hand, misjudging fear for respect. Murder and mayhem are the key words of his reign. He also seems to report to a trumvirate of corrupt police officials whom he refers to as the wisemen. Unfortunately for Alonzo, he has come to believe his own hype and bites off more than he can chew, ultimately pissing off the wrong people.Ethan Hawke gives his best performance ever, imbuing Jake with a vulnerability and innocence that is believable and compelling, making Jake's struggle with his situation all the more angst ridden. It is a balance of the desire to succeed and get ahead with the instinctive knowledge of right and wrong. The viewer sees Jake going along with Alonzo at first, wanting to please his superior officer, even when some of the things Alonzo asks him to do are not only transgressions of police procedure, but violations of the very laws that they are employed as police to enforce. As Alonzo inveigles Jake to cross the line, the viewer can see the struggle within Jake take place, as shock gives way to a struggle for his very survival. The only question is whether Jake's better nature will ultimately allow him to do what he believes to be right. Ethan Hawke's a performance is  certainly worthy of its Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.This is a gripping film, with a fair amount of violence. Wonderful performances are also given by Scott Glenn, a drug lord whose dream of retiring to the Phillipines is cut short, as well as by Macy Gray, who is sensational in the role of another drug lord's wife. While some of the film is over the top, it is a film that will not fail to entertain and engage the viewer.The DVD is loaded with extras, providing a feature length adio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua, additional scenes, an alternate ending, two music videos, as well as a behind the scenes documentary.

586362,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JKEC,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 1]","While I won't say that I liked this movie, it is one that won't let go.  I saw it in the theatre.  Watching the DVD version made me realize how vividly I recalled the film.  Any film that stays with you enough to be memorable must be good, even if it isn't likeable.  Screenwriter David Ayers (The Fast & the Furious) provides an action-packed character study with the moral question: Do the ends justify the means?  Most would answer ""no,"" but Denzel Washington's character Alonzo Harris has bit hook, line & sinker that whatever it takes is what he will do.  In doing that, he has become corrupt.  Ethan Hawke's character Jake Hoyt begins by saying that he'll do WHATEVER Alonzo wants, which leads to the oft repeated phrase, ""You're my nigger.""  His journey in the film leads him to reject this.  Some were bothered by the contrivance that Hoyt (Hawke) stops a rape, only to have that act be the one that keeps his brains from being splattered in the bottom of a bathtub.  I didn't view it a problem.  For me, the one act of good that is done in the film produces another act of goodness, letting Hawke go by the gang contracted to kill him.  For me, it reinforces the theme that evil begets evil, and good begets good.Aside from the debate of whether Denzel deserved the Oscar or Ethan his best supporting actor Oscar nomination, what impressed me with the film was the depth of the supporting performances.  One of the stars for me is Eva Mendes who plays Sara Harris, Alonzo's Spanish lover.  She was so gracious when she first met Hawke, loving to her son, sexy with Alonzo, terrified of the gunfire, protective of her son, and finally in one last shot we see her from a window whisk up her son and turn her back on Alonzo.  For a small part, she had an amazing array of levels.  I didn't pick out the actor's name, but the little boy was about as wonderful of a sweetheart as any mom could want.  Scott Glen also wonderfully plays Roger, the drug dealer who is a dear friend and fast buddy of Alonzo's, only to be shot by him when convenience dictates.  Macy Gray as the Sandman's wife does an on-the-edge cameo bursting with energy.  I appreciated the added features of the DVD.

But here his acting chops are non-stop fireworks and he is amazing.As Alonzo Harris, the thoroughly corrupt veteran cop in the LAPD Narcotics Division, Washington dominates every scene he's in--which is, in fact, practically every scene in the film save for the very beginning.

And that's what he is.This serious nastiness permeates the film as we see him and his rookie partner, played by Ethan Hawke, take a tour of L.A.'s seamy side, sniffing out illegal drugs, scaring the ... out of some college kids, putting the finishing touches on a ten-year master drug dealer, halting the rape in progress of a 14 year old girl.Hawke does a great job too; he's tough but has the heart Washington's character had long ago--but lost to street life eating away at his soul.While the story, as such, is essentially a sequence of events--this happens, then that happens, then, etc.--the real reason to see the film is for Mr. W.  Denzel Washington, finally nabbing the Oscar for a truly distinguished career up to this point, here turns in an absolutely tour de force performance, not to be missed.

Quido ""quidrock""","[6, 7]","and put it in the hands of a relatively new director (Antoine Fuqua, ""The Replacement Killers"") - it could be a disaster, but it wasn't!  Instead, Fuqua was able to center the film around the marvelous performance of Denzel Washington.  Denzel, who won his last Academy Award playing a driven man with little regard for good/evil (Glory), has been offered and has accepted a couple of decades worth of ""good guy"" and hero roles, predicated on his screen sense, believeability and physical beauty.  Passed up for an Oscar in the stunning, ""Hurricane"", Denzel had to find a role that would allow him to showcase all that nuance, all that skill, and all that bravery to play a role that is corrupt, sly, and yet that of a man that draws others to himself by his ability to take risks and survive.  He fills the screen in this role - from the scene in which he can't read his newspaper to his final gasp for breath. The only other ""star"" is the LA terrain itself - it is brutal and nightmarish.Ethan Hawke plays the rookie, Jake,  he is trying to ""train"" as a narc, and there are some flashes of glory in his portrayal, as well, along with some excellent cameos from a supporting cast - but the film is really all Denzel (and his car!)bringing his own brand of justice to bear in a situation where he must succeed or he will be killed.  Starting out as subtly corrupt, you are caught in disbelief, as is Jake, as Denzel's twists and turns escalate with terrifying intensity.  Fuqua appears to have just followed Denzel's lead to anchor the movie, although some of the screenwriting and hyperactive pacing really add to the intensity.When it is over, you are blown away - by the tale, by the violence, by the brilliance of the performance. Check out the alternate ending and scenes in the DVD, as well.

Denzel Washington gives an Academy Award-winning performance as Alonzo, a hard-edged street cop whose specialty is narcotics. Ethan Hawke plays his rookie of the day who is fresh from training and is green in the field. The film, as the title implies, follows our characters for a day and we see Alonzo do some things we're not sure we want cops doing, such as drinking and driving, stealing money, and taking drugs. While the film's ending is highly predictable and even inevitable, it still leaves a strong impact on the audience. Denzel Washington is completely outstanding as the narcotics detective. This really is a hugely different role for him and he handles it effortlessly, putting him among other film tough-guys like DeNiro, Humphrey Bogart, Al Pacino, and Sean Connery. Washington glows on the screen, steals the show from an already-outstanding cast and flexes those acting muscles like he never has before. Some people questioned his getting the Oscar for this movie. I don't. This is the best performance so far in his career. Director Antoine Fuqua also does a splendid job in keeping the film fluid, fast, and furious.

586380,A129YBX5BVNW2,B00005JKEC,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***I remember seeing ""Training Day"" at the cinema in 2001 - the audience applauded at the end - and most left their seats with its gritty brilliance seared into their unconscious. I'm glad to say that revisiting this urban drug story in 2012 finds that Antoine Fuqua's directorial debut hasn't lost one jot of its power - and better still - is now genuinely enhanced by its reissue on BLU RAY.The picture quality is far better than I expected - a really crisp transfer. Its default aspect is 2.4:1 - so there are bars top and bottom of the screen - but even stretched to full frame - the print quality still holds up. A lot of the scenes are one-on-one dialogue pieces in the front of cars between the two male leads - but expertly filmed and edited - there's no real blocking. Side shots of their faces are startlingly clear - even the sequences towards the end in people's homes and out on the streets at night are very, very clean. It's a top-notch transfer...Written by DAVID AYER (a white man who grew up in the South Central projects of Los Angeles) and directed by ANTOINE FUQUA (a black man who did the same)- it's about a fresh-faced cop Jake Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke) who is hooked up with legendary narcotics Detective Alonzo Harris (played by Denzel Washington) for one 'training day'. From dawn to dusk - it will be a baptism of fire.At first Alonzo has the air of a man who's doing what he has to do to keep the river of drugs off the streets of Los Angeles. His methods may be brutal - but in the heat of street-justice - the end justifies the means. The problem is that while the young rookie cuts the mustard in the eagerness department, unfortunately he's also highly principled - and this begins to encrouch on Alonzo's habit of turning the other way when he's gathering info to make busts of the big guys (15,000 years of incarciration handed out and counting). Alonzo also feels that Hoyt's Academy naivety will get him killed in the real world (dialogue above). So Hoyt struggles. But then things get gradually murkier...and even life-threatening...Soon after a car bust - Jake is drawn into Alonzo's doped-up world and begins to feel like he's being played - but Alonzo keeps proffering believable reasons for his actions. Only a brave intervention (a young Latino girl being raped by two lowlifes in a lane) saves Jake from the clutches of a double-barrelled bathroom death. Soon (bruised and battered) Jake is taking the game to Alonzo's neighbourhood - and on it goes to a brilliant but inevitably bloody ending...Part of the reason why ""Training Day"" works is that there's an air of authenticity in the script that echoes The Wire and The Sopranos (both Author and Director have been there). The bad language and street talk is either vicious or impenetrable - and frequently both. A dance of fear and intimidation co-exists between the cops and the largely Black and Latino communities. No one is clean and few get away from it unaffected. Some areas of the city are even no-go zones - poverty and bad housing being a breeding ground. Gun law abounds and it's hard to tell the difference between Dictators - the drug-pusher or the police officer who protects the drug-pusher...Denzel is truly magnificent in the part (a departure from his nice-guy roles) - he inhabits his gold-chained Alonzo with a power and ferocity that few actors could even get near. You feel this mouthy monster owning the areas he walks into and you understand why many of them smile as Alonzo approaches - but would gladly put several bullets in his back as he leaves. Ethan Hawke does well to keep up with such a tour-de-force - and at times - even matches him. It's not surprising that Washington took his 2nd Oscar for it (""Philadelphia"" was his first).The supporting cast too is exceptional - rappers Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre as drug-dealing hoodies - singer Macy Gray as a crack wife - Eve Mendes as Alonzo's squeeze - Scott Glen as an old veteran - and the trio of corrupt officials - Tom Berenger, Raymond J. Barry and Harris Yulin (who feature in the 'Alternate Ending' in the Extras). And special mention should also go to the locals and the then unknown Latino cast - some of who are actually gang members. Fantastic stuff...and so impressive...To sum up - a great film then - now made better by a format that allows it to shine.This is precisely what a good BLU RAY reissue should be.Recommended like a hard rock in the crack den at the back of The White House...(yo Barrack).BLU RAY Specifications:VIDEO: 1080p High Definition 2.4:1 Aspect RatioAUDIO: Dolby Digital English 5.1, French 5.1 and German 5.1SUBTITLES: English, French and GermanEXTRAS:1.

Denzel and Russell could switch places in the different movies and still both movies would fair as well theatrically; those characters are that similar in application and practice. Training Day is better throughout, but Dark Blue has a better ending.Denzel starts the movie out by trying to convince Hoyt through intimidation(makes him look like a sissy when he either reluctantly or does not conform to the smaller tactics of dirtiness and control). At the same time, Denzel has a plan that he has working to ensure the success of his schemes and agenda. Denzel is the perfect puppetmaster, if you will bend--even unbeknownst to you--then he'll get you. If you compared Denzel to Van Meter, there's no comparison--as Denzel is  far more subtle; uses widely varying psychological methods to coerce one's emotions or what the person will logically  accept/tolerate; and, therefore,could affect many more people(Van Meter only demands, uses associations, and uses tactics like you owe me or this is the last time). Case in point, Denzel has 3 or 4 known killers who are cops that he's coerced into infamy. The thing is that Hoyt(Hawke) resists the programming or there wouldn't be a movie. Although some of this programming causes Hoyt to do things that he wouldn't otherwise do, it does not have the desired effect: it does not change him. Hoyt--for the most part--knows who he is and is comfortable with that. Denzel--when manipulating people--uses subtlety; he goes down a similar road with situations. When he finds out that Hoyt will not be programmed into murder, he subtly--through his Hispanic gang banger connections--seeks to put his lights out. Hoyt's only saved when(bc he saved the lead gangster 's cousin from being raped by crackheads)the lead gangster lets him go. A battle ensues between Hoyt and Denzel, but the battle does not end the movie and I will not give it away. Favorite Segment of the Movie: [In anger, Denzel says when confronted by a community that attempts to help Hoyt remove tyrant Denzel] ""King Kong ain't got ..it on me! I work here; y'all just live here."" The Original Dark Blue--Russell probably got ideas and pointers from Denzel.

He is fun to watch as he took Jake Hoyt(Hawke) through a day on the streets of LA to see if he will fit in his Narcotics unit.  Washington does a good job playing an amoral character as he toys to with Jake to see how far he will go into the dark side and make amoral choices.Times I was wondering if Alonzo is simply evil or a master of the mind screw as he seems to be testing Jake.There are many tense scenes but overall the script is not that great as it seems to center on Alonzo posturing.  Even in the end I did not finding myself disliking Alonzo which I think was the intent of the writer.  Overall, the script was not tight.  What of the amoral men of Alonzo's unit?  Would they not go after Jake?  The corrupt officials you see in one scene?  Many questions are left unanswered.Overall, it's not a bad film.

586384,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKEC,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","The elements necessary to create a first-rate thriller are all present in ""Training Day"" - an explosive script by David Ayers, taunt direction by Antoine Fuqua, and inspired, Oscar nominated performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. One drawback: As the characters' lives spin further and further out of control, so does the story. The constructs so carefully built from the first of the movie are torn apart by the chaotic, somewhat illogical climax. While far from the worst ending ever conceived, its weakness and overall generic quality make this a very, very good movie, as opposed to a classic.Hawke plays Jake, a Los Angeles police officer who is about to spend his first day on the job as a narcotics officer. The opening does a good job of emphasizing his ambition, which helps to validate his actions later on. That morning he meets his new boss, Alonzo [Washington] for the first time. Alonzo is one of those hip, charismatic characters who has learned the streets so well that it's almost impossible to differentiate him from the villains he pursues. As they drive around the streets of LA, Jake begins to realize that Alonzo's training methods are becoming increasingly bizarre and violent. At a couple of points early in the day, the rookie has his chance to walk away, but that ambitious streak forces him to stick around. By afternoon, it's too late. He's caught up in a web of deceit and mayhem straight out of the film noir handbook.Washington is completely convincing playing a man who once was good and honest, and now is worse than the criminals he hunts. Part of him still sees himself as someone doing the right thing, though the rest of him knows he's become the tyrannical ruler of a pathetic little kingdom, someone who will do in his oldest friend if necessity so dictates.  Pride has become his fatal flaw. Hawke gives his best performance ever and manages to keep up with his dazzling co-star. He quietly manages to convey the idea that he is much like Alonzo was when he started out. Whether or no he is destined to become like him is left nicely ambiguous.The key to enjoying ""Training Day"" is to see it for what it is - a movie. Attempts to compare it to what really goes on in the streets of LA will lead only to a series of frustrating, unanswerable questions.",4,"Taunt, Over-the-top Thriller",1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,2303,"['elements', 'necessary', 'create', 'first-rate', 'thriller', 'are', 'present', 'Training', 'Day', 'explosive', 'script', 'David', 'Ayers', 'taunt', 'direction', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'inspired', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performances', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'One', 'drawback', 'characters', 'lives', 'spin', 'further', 'further', 'control', 'so', 'story', 'constructs', 'so', 'carefully', 'built', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'torn', 'apart', 'chaotic', 'somewhat', 'illogical', 'climax', 'far', 'worst', 'ending', 'ever', 'conceived', 'weakness', 'overall', 'generic', 'quality', 'make', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'opposed', 'classic.Hawke', 'plays', 'Jake', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'spend', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'narcotics', 'officer', 'opening', 'good', 'job', 'emphasizing', 'ambition', 'validate', 'actions', 'later', 'morning', 'new', 'boss', 'Alonzo', '[', 'Washington', ']', 'first', 'time', 'Alonzo', 'one', 'hip', 'charismatic', 'characters', 'who', 'learned', 'streets', 'so', 'well', 'almost', 'impossible', 'differentiate', 'villains', 'drive', 'streets', 'LA', 'Jake', 'realize', 'Alonzo', 'training', 'methods', 'are', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'violent', 'couple', 'points', 'early', 'day', 'rookie', 'chance', 'walk', 'away', 'ambitious', 'streak', 'forces', 'stick', 'around', 'afternoon', 'too', 'late', 'caught', 'up', 'web', 'deceit', 'mayhem', 'straight', 'film', 'noir', 'handbook.Washington', 'completely', 'convincing', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'good', 'honest', 'now', 'worse', 'criminals', 'Part', 'still', 'someone', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'rest', 'become', 'tyrannical', 'ruler', 'pathetic', 'little', 'kingdom', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'oldest', 'friend', 'necessity', 'so', 'Pride', 'become', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Hawke', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'keep', 'up', 'dazzling', 'co-star', 'quietly', 'convey', 'idea', 'much', 'Alonzo', 'was', 'when', 'started', 'out', 'destined', 'become', 'left', 'nicely', 'ambiguous.The', 'key', 'enjoying', 'Training', 'Day', 'see', 'what', 'movie', 'Attempts', 'compare', 'what', 'really', 'streets', 'LA', 'will', 'lead', 'only', 'series', 'frustrating', 'unanswerable', 'questions']",N/A

Washington won an Oscar for his role as Alonzo, a cop gone very, very bad.  Taking the stance that to fight crime, one has to be a criminal, Washington takes us through the paces of a dirty cop who will do anything to achieve his own personal agenda.  What he does to the Sandman is bad enough, but how he sets up his new rookie partner, is abyssmal and out and out vile!  Ethan Hawke is exceedingly good in a role that netted him an oscar nomination as the new rookie who would do anything for his new boss to assure his chances of getting detective ranking.  However, as his training day goes on, Hawke realizes just how corrupt his boss is.The film is slow in the beginning, and by the time it picks up its pace, all I wanted was to see Washington go down.  Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin and Raymond J. Barry are wasted in their roles, but in the extras, we get a deleted scene that really shows what their purpose in the film was.  Why it was taken out is a mystery to me.  The politically correct usage of rappers Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg and the singer Macy Gray continue to show what's wrong with movies these days:  go for the youth market, even though the three above mentioned performers are not actors, and they are only used to up the box office potential.All in all, this is not what one could call an entertaining movie...it's worth lies in the searing performances of Washington and Hawke.  Just once, too, wouldn't it be nice to see the corrupted cop be revealed to the public for what he was? No, again, we find Washington's death (spoiler here? Not really) eulogied as a good cop going down while trying to serve a high risk warrant.  Cover up cover up.....makes one wonder if there's any cop we can trust?  Come on, movie makers, let's show these guys for what they really are, not beautify their deaths.

Even from watching some of the previews of the movie, I knew I was in for a wild and unpredictable ride.  And I was right.Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke star in this powerhouse cop thriller.  Hawke plays rookie cop, Jake Hoyt.  Hoyt has dreams of becoming a detective, and hopes that he will be able to put away every single scum-of-the-earth criminal for good.  But before he can do that, he must survive a day with Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington).  And on this day, Hoyt will see the dark side of the streets, the job, and most importantly, the dark side of human beings.  The next 24 hours will be the longest hours of Rookie Jake Hoyt's life.The acting is really amazing.  Of course, Washington is great, as he is in almost every role he takes.  But, he shows us he can break away from his traditional &quot;likable good guy&quot; roles, and take on the role of a sadistic and psychopathic cop who will do what it takes to get the job done at any cost.  Hawke is also terrific, and should've recieved more recognition for his part in the movie.  I also liked seeing Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre as well; they proved to be very talented actors.The writing is really effective; with very realistic and believable dialogue.  And Antoine Fuqua does a fabulous job as director.  Being that he knows exactly how it is on the streets, it made him that more of an effective director, and adds to the movie's credibility.The DVD is not bad as well, being that it is a Warner Bros. DVD.  Usually, they don't add too many special features, but they did on this one.  Theres a bunch of deleted scenes, a making of feature, 2 music videos, the trailer of the movie, and many more.  The picture is crystal clear; presented in 16:9 widescreen.  And the sound is also great; quiet when it should be, and loud when it's supposed to be.&quot;Training Day&quot; is a great movie filled with action, drama, and a lot of unpredictable twists and turns.  If you're looking for a good cop action/thriller that is unlike any other, then this just might be the movie for you.

But the ""one day"" motif is not a gimmick: this aspect of the film succeeds perfectly. Denzel Washington plays a veteran cop who has himself become a criminal offender, and Ethan Hawke is the impressionable young cop whom Washington's character seeks to corrupt. Thus, ""Day"" is something of a modern-day morality fable.Both Washington and Hawke have earned praise for their roles, and they do make a compelling screen duo. Washington creates a character who is truly vile and hateable, but I found his performance a bit stagy at times -- it had too much of a self-conscious ""Look, Ma, I'm acting!"" feel. I thought that Hawke actually gave the far stronger performance, but this may be because ultimately his character has a far more interesting developmental arc than that of Washington's. The two get solid backup from an eclectic supporting cast; I was particularly impressed by Snoop Dogg as a small-time criminal.""Day"" is a suspenseful, gripping film helmed with real power by Fuqua. There is a genuinely ominous, threatening feel to many scenes. While the film succeeds totally as a crime thriller, however, I felt like it could have been more; it raises serious issues about crime, justice, power, and morality without, I felt, offering any new insights.

He plays the type of character that if you just had the  television on while you were doing things and Training Day happened to be on and you had never seen it you'd slowly find yourself drawn to the t.v and keep watching as his character grabs you.  I just watched it the other night and I remembered his character having all these cool lines like Samuel L. Jackson's character did in Pulp Fiction from my first viewing but not so much, granted there are some cool lines but it is Washington's delivery of those lines that make them seem so cool, almost like  how comedians say it's all about timing.Other movie characters that come to mind that I feel there character out shined the movie are Kathy Bates in Misery and Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher in Scorsese's Gangs of New York.  I would also mention Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lambs but that film is great all around as it showed at Oscar time and matches Hopkins performance.  Each of these characters I mention had strong supporting actors to enhance there performance like a dancing partner who is always there to catch and support the other partner.  Kathy Bates had James Caan and Daniel Day Lewis had Leonardo DiCaprio now Denzel Washington gets his support from Ethan Hawke, who did not get an Oscar win as Washington Deservedly did for his role of Alonzo but did get an Oscar nomination.With 493 reviews of this movie at the time I'm writing this and a good plot synopsis from Amazon there really is no reason to go into any plot detail, just wanted to point out A great movie character made by Denzel Washington and the reason this is a must see for his performance alone.DVDThe picture and sound quality of this movie were great, I watched The Good Shepard on HD-DVD after this and Training Day on regular dvd looked possibly more impressive.

586398,A17G7WJKAJVKQW,B00005JKEC,"Mike ""Mike""","[2, 3]","This was a great flick. Hands-down, it's the best work Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke have each done, respectively. Washington plays corrupt detective Alonzo with so much charisma, it is frighteningly convincing. This story (aided by the superb acting) is a perfect demonstration how charisma and strong personality can overwhelm those unsuspecting individuals who are in a ""I look up to you"" position.The heart of the film is Ethan Hawke's portrayal which functions as a perfect counter to Washington's. Here, we see the idealistic young cop faced with the reality of the jaded, corrupt, and ultimately evil cop.

I wish I could agree that it was good, but... whoa. QUITE the contrary. It stunk like Schwartzenegger and Stallone in a B.O. contest.The first hour or so wasn't bad: the criminals and cops portrayed were admirably ruthless, and the rendering of the streets was almost totally convincing. It did get a little old how Denzel kept pulling the car over to lay something heavy on Ethan Hawke, and it was a little strange that Hawke knew nothing of police corruption after serving on the force for 19 months (I know more about it just from reading the paper). But these are small quibbles, and the movie seemed alright on the whole.Then it took an abrupt turn into Stupidland. Suddenly the ruthless criminals started acting like pussycats. Suddenly Hawke exhibited the healing powers of Wolverine after being beaten within an inch of his life. Suddenly the villain began passing up easy opportunities to shoot the hero (e.g., when he climbed onto the roof), even though he wanted him dead. And, most telling of all, suddenly the hero got one of those hunches that's always right, one of those Hollywood hunches that heroes in lousy movies always get, for no reason except the screenwriters' laziness: I mean Hawke's certainty that he'd find Denzel (who for all he knows is on his way to pay off some Russian gangsters) at his girlfriend's house in the Hood. And of course, the Boyz N the Hood all suddenly love Hawke, and willingly ""get his back,"" even though an hour or so ago their malice toward his badge and white skin was only held in check by the sheltering presence of Denzel.This is one of the hallmarks of mediocrity in movies: when events defy belief on the movie's own terms. When a trio of thugs who are career criminals and rabid cop-haters transform into the world's most impartial jury before your eyes (""Very well, I will call my cousin on the cellphone before killing you!""), and when a streetwise cop tries to escape his death sentence by DRIVING TO THE AIRPORT (as if anyone who's ever seen a cop show or mafia drama on TV couldn't tell him, ""Don't go near the airport when there's a price on your head, fool!""), you know you're looking at second-rate, farm league, TV-grade stuff. I don't demand realism as a rule; I like James Bond and over-the-top action movies; but a movie that's supposed to be gritty has got to commit to realism.Other reviewers have theorized that this movie's script was started by a good writer and finished by a bad one.

586406,AEGR7IBHUM3R7,B00005JKEC,mp,"[11, 13]","Once Denzel Washington picked up the Oscar for Best Actor, me and my buddy Ry decided it was time to see what all the fuss was about - that and the fact that the trailer showed that both Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre were in the movie. That aside, I'd recently been watching a lot of the PBS presentation of Joseph Campbell and ""The Power of Myth"" which enhanced and coloured my enjoyment of ""Training Day"". For, it seems apparent that the story of the film draws on the basic myth/religious story of the temptation of the hero, the descent into hell, and the choice between damnation and salvation. Denzel and Ethan Hawke play their roles of tempter and tempted with great vivacity and depth, drawing us once again into a time-tested myth, this time set in the Los Angeles drug scene.""Training Day"" begins with a look at Jake's (Hawke) cozy home, beautiful wife, and settled life, all of which will be unsettled in the day that follows. Assigned as an apprentice of sorts to a narcotics detective, Alonzo (Washington), Jake is given one day to see whether he is cut out for high stakes narc work. Alonzo quickly puts Jake through his paces, trying to inculcate the philosophy that in the narc game, one has to be willing to live and operate according to the same rules as the enemy, and to all appearance, become the enemy. Jake's innocence and idealism cause him some hesitation and reticence about following Alonzo's example.This is the mythological trope, though, and the point that the film turns on - Alonzo tells Jake that if he plays the game right, and is willing to split his personality and his objectives - to be a ""wolf"" and abandon his essential self while he's on duty, Jake can make detective in 18 months. Alonzo sanctions murder, theft, and deceit, and offers Jake a kingdom in return for his principles. The way the conflict manifests itself internally within Jake and externally between Jake and Alonzo is compelling and deeply moving, especially as Jake finds himself being drawn in by Alonzo both by and against his own will.""Training Day"" gives us a multifaceted perspective on narcotics investigation. We see it from the point of view of the drug dealer, Roger, who is simply looking forward to retirement; from the users themselves, including an appearance by Snoop Dogg; from Alonzo's 'team' of narc agents, including Dr. Dre; and the multicultural views of the black and hispanic communities through which the drug trade passes through and infects. Recalling the opening scene with Jake and his wife, we are presented with Alonzo's 'second family,' a mistress and a small boy - this alternate life Jake must weigh, negotiate, and come to terms with in order to save himself. Jake also finds that he must learn the language and the mannerisms of the streets - governed by loyalty, reciprocity, and exchange - and find a way to keep himself above it, if possible.The DVD of ""Training Day"" is full of really high-quality extras. In most DVD's I've seen that have bonus/deleted scenes, the extra moments you get aren't worth watching. Not so here. There are at least three scenes, not to mention the alternate ending, which give even further complexity to the main characters and their fraught relationship. They are so good, I believe they should have been left in the movie, but since they weren't, it's good to have them in the DVD. Absolutely a DVD worth owning, and a movie well worth seeing several times. Washington's performance is sparkling, riveting, and wholly believable, as he plays a tempter caught up in his own intrigues. Hawke is also very good in his role, but it is really no different (save in degree) from the doe-eyed innocent thrown into a cruel world that he's been doing since ""Dead Poets Society"". Not to undercut his performance; of course, with all that practice, he does a terrific job.

586410,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JKEC,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[1, 2]","As everyone knows by now, this is the movie for which Denzel Washington won a first and long overdue leading actor Oscar for his portrayal of Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris, a corrupt undercover narcotics in South Central LA and also the film for which Ethan Hawke also received his first Oscar nomination, as Washington's fresh faced rookie partner for the day, Jake. But is Training day any good and did Denzel deserve his Oscar?First off, I have to admit to being a long time admirer and self-confessed fan of Denzel Washington's work, ever since first seeing him grace the big screen in movies such as Cry Freedom and For Queen and Country. Sure there have been some disappointing movies along the way, such as The Mighty Quinn, Virtuosity, Fallen and The Bone Collector, but none of these duds could be apportioned to the always charismatic (and way too handsome for my liking) Mr Washington. Denzel Washington has been a star of big screen and small for twenty years and has established himself as one of Hollywoods great stars, equally able to carry your typical commercial Hollywood fodder (The Pelican Brief, Courage Under Fire, The Siege, John Q etc.) and to shine as a great actor in great movies such as Malcolm X, The Hurricane, Glory (for which he won a best supporting actor Oscar), and the excellent and underrated Spike Lee movie He Got Game.In cop thriller Training Day, Denzel Washington plays a charismatic, utterly corrupt sergeant in the LAPD narcotics squad who takes honest, ambitious rookie Ethan Hawke under his wing for a day and tries to destroy his integrity. It made a great change to see Denzel Washington cast-against-type in his first unsympathetic role in the meaty villainous of Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris, a commanding and morally detestable figure, whose comeuppance we eagerly await. The movie is violent and has a rapid pace and for the vast majority of the movie it is dark, edgy and morally ambiguous as we are taken on a tour of the `hoods and we see Alonzo increasingly bending then breaking the laws he is supposed to uphold. Washington as Alonzo Harris is as charismatic as ever and he justifies his interventions with clever rhetoric, playing with both Jake's and our heads, leading both us and the fresh faced rookie astray. But as the movie progresses it becomes clear that Alonso is more than a cop that bends the rules to get the job done, a la Popeye Doyle in The French Connection. No, we soon realise that he's no more than a shark with a badge; he's a psychopath worse than the crack pushers, the rapists and general low life of south central LA. He's more than morally ambiguous he's morally corrupt.There's much to enjoy in Training Day, particularly in the lead performances of both its stars, Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. Denzel's role is a showy part and it allows him to demonstrate once again what a fine actor he is, whilst Hawke in the less showy and understated role, as the cop with integrity, is no less impressive. Training Day is for the most part a well acted, well-directed (by Antoine Fuqua) movie that like the Sean Penn/Robert Duvall movie Colors comes from a darker angle with regard to police work in LA but ultimately just when it reaches its climax it cops out (if you'll excuse the pun), turning from something darker and edgier than the usual Hollywood fodder into something akin to the usual Hollywood fodder, with a climax reliant upon incredible coincidence and an implausibility with regard to the response of the homies that occupy Alonso's neighbourhood. It's also arguably a tad over-long (but then aren't most movies?). As for Denzel's Oscar, it's a bit of a tough one to call and whilst Denzel Washington is undoubtedly excellent (as always) I can't help but feel that we've seen him better in the likes of Malcolm X, Hurricane and He Got Game. It's also hard to deny the possibility that Russell Crowe performance in A Beautiful Mind was at least on a par and that perhaps the Academy felt it was time to recognise an actor who had been unfairly overlooked before. Maybe I'm too much of an idealist but it seems a terrible shame to me that the Oscars appear to be decided politically and by popularity rather than merit. If they were decided on merit Denzel Washington might already have had a couple of Best Actor Oscars and maybe (just maybe) the less popular but extremely talented Russell Crowe would have bagged his second Oscar for A Beautiful Mind. Maybe?However, don't let any of that put you off. Ultimately Training Day is a good movie with great performances. It's just a pity it's not a great movie with great performances but only because it cops out at the end. 3  stars out of 5.",4,Mr Washington Goes To Town,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,4697,"['everyone', 'now', 'movie', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'won', 'first', 'long', 'overdue', 'leading', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'corrupt', 'undercover', 'narcotics', 'South', 'Central', 'LA', 'also', 'film', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'also', 'received', 'first', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Washington', 'fresh', 'faced', 'rookie', 'partner', 'day', 'Jake', 'Training', 'day', 'good', 'did', 'Denzel', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'First', 'have', 'admit', 'being', 'long', 'time', 'admirer', 'self-confessed', 'fan', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'work', 'ever', 'first', 'seeing', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'movies', 'such', 'Cry', 'Freedom', 'Queen', 'Country', 'Sure', 'have', 'been', 'disappointing', 'movies', 'way', 'such', 'Mighty', 'Quinn', 'Virtuosity', 'Fallen', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'none', 'duds', 'could', 'be', 'apportioned', 'always', 'charismatic', 'way', 'too', 'handsome', 'liking', 'Mr', 'Washington', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'been', 'star', 'big', 'screen', 'small', 'twenty', 'years', 'established', 'one', 'Hollywoods', 'great', 'stars', 'equally', 'able', 'carry', 'typical', 'commercial', 'Hollywood', 'fodder', 'Pelican', 'Brief', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'Siege', 'John', 'Q', 'etc', 'shine', 'great', 'actor', 'great', 'movies', 'such', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Hurricane', 'Glory', 'won', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'excellent', 'underrated', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'Got', 'Game.In', 'cop', 'thriller', 'Training', 'Day', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'charismatic', 'utterly', 'corrupt', 'sergeant', 'LAPD', 'narcotics', 'squad', 'who', 'honest', 'ambitious', 'rookie', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'wing', 'day', 'tries', 'destroy', 'integrity', 'made', 'great', 'change', 'see', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'cast-against-type', 'first', 'unsympathetic', 'role', 'meaty', 'villainous', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'commanding', 'morally', 'detestable', 'figure', 'comeuppance', 'eagerly', 'await', 'movie', 'violent', 'rapid', 'pace', 'vast', 'majority', 'movie', 'dark', 'edgy', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'are', 'taken', 'tour', 'hoods', 'see', 'Alonzo', 'increasingly', 'bending', 'then', 'breaking', 'laws', 'supposed', 'uphold', 'Washington', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'as', 'charismatic', 'ever', 'interventions', 'clever', 'rhetoric', 'playing', 'Jake', 'heads', 'leading', 'fresh', 'faced', 'rookie', 'astray', 'movie', 'clear', 'Alonso', 'more', 'cop', 'rules', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'la', 'Popeye', 'Doyle', 'French', 'Connection', 'No', 'soon', 'realise', 'more', 'shark', 'badge', 'psychopath', 'worse', 'crack', 'pushers', 'rapists', 'general', 'low', 'life', 'south', 'central', 'LA', 'more', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'morally', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Training', 'Day', 'particularly', 'lead', 'performances', 'stars', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Denzel', 'role', 'showy', 'part', 'demonstrate', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'fine', 'actor', 'whilst', 'Hawke', 'less', 'showy', 'understated', 'role', 'cop', 'integrity', 'less', 'impressive', 'Training', 'Day', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'acted', 'well-directed', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'movie', 'Sean', 'Penn/Robert', 'Duvall', 'movie', 'Colors', 'darker', 'angle', 'regard', 'police', 'work', 'LA', 'ultimately', 'just', 'when', 'climax', 'out', ""'ll"", 'excuse', 'pun', 'turning', 'something', 'darker', 'edgier', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'fodder', 'something', 'akin', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'fodder', 'climax', 'reliant', 'incredible', 'coincidence', 'implausibility', 'regard', 'response', 'homies', 'occupy', 'Alonso', 'neighbourhood', 'also', 'arguably', 'tad', 'over-long', 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'movies', 'Denzel', 'Oscar', 'bit', 'tough', 'one', 'call', 'whilst', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'undoubtedly', 'excellent', 'always', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'likes', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Hurricane', 'Got', 'Game', 'also', 'hard', 'deny', 'possibility', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'was', 'least', 'par', 'perhaps', 'Academy', 'felt', 'was', 'time', 'recognise', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'unfairly', 'overlooked', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'much', 'idealist', 'terrible', 'shame', 'Oscars', 'appear', 'be', 'decided', 'politically', 'popularity', 'rather', 'merit', 'were', 'decided', 'merit', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'might', 'already', 'have', 'had', 'couple', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscars', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'less', 'popular', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'would', 'have', 'bagged', 'second', 'Oscar', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Maybe', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'put', 'off', 'Ultimately', 'Training', 'Day', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'performances', 'just', 'pity', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'performances', 'only', 'out', 'end', '3', 'stars', '5']",N/A

Washington and Hawke are good, but once again nowhere near the hype.  The violent finale is so absurd!  And when the main elements of the plot are revealed it is also absurd.  We can stretch our imaginations to a certain degree, but this is clearly a screenplay and not anywhere close to something realistic.  As far as the academy award goes, I'm completely disgusted by the best actor award.  Denzel is good (as he usually is) but his performance isn't even in the same class as the one by Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.  A Beautiful Mind wins all the main awards based upon Crowe's incredible, driven performance and he doesn't win best actor?  We know the academy likes Denzel and doesn't care for Crowe's antics, we know there was an incredible campaign to get Denzel the award, we know there was all that criticism that A beautiful Mind left out shady elements of the main character's life, but did the voters actually think about the 2 performances solely on merit?  Crowe's performance will be heralded for a long time to come, while Denzel's award will be seen as a make-up academy award (like Newman in The Color of Money).  I don't understand the make-up award factor since I looked back at the past times he was nominated and I'm not sure he should have won one, except for the supporting actor award in Glory.  Ultimately Denzel gives a good (not great) performance in a very forgettable, unrealistic movie.  When you see the performances 10 years from now, what will you think?

Does that make any sense?  If you heard that this is one of the strongest and most unflinchingly real movies to come out exploring the seedy underbelly of the police force as well as a film that brought Denzel Washington to new unexplored heights as an actor (an' ya probably diddn't think he could get any higher that he already was), then you heard right.  This is the film that re-established him as my personal favorite actor, as well as caused those stiffs at the Academy to finally throw down an' give him a damn Best Actor Oscar, after the years of hard work he's put in.  But at the same time, y'all folks needa recognize Ethan Hawke's contribution to the movie as well.In this kind of film, where the lead character is a rogue and ruthless crooked cop with seemingly no morals or respect for anything, you HAVE to have somebody to keep the film steeped in the reality of the everyday Joe.  It's the only way that the film could be disturbing and effective, without alienating its audience.  Well, Ethan Hawke is that everyday Joe.  He's rookie cop Jake Hoyt, young, boyish, naive, new husband and father; he just wants what we all want, to take care of his family by working and doing whatever possible to make it into the high ranks of his profession.  If only he had known what that was going to involve.It's become almost mandatory these days when making an urban film, that you HAVE to cast some hip-hop and R&B; stars that want to try their hand at acting in small roles.  This film is no exception, and that is at times for the better and at times for the worse.  I tell ya I ain't even recognize Macy Gray until I heard that rough, sandpaper voice of her's, but she plays a nasty ol' hood rat, complete with a sassy attitude, some long fingernails and a mouth like a sailor.  She done impressed me though, I must say.  The parapalegic crack dealer is played by Snoop Dogg, who was almost perfect in his role, but there had to be a rotten apple I guess, an' here that comes in the form of Dr. Dre.  He plays one of Alonzo's crooked narc troops, but he jus' don't got the acting skill at all.  His thick braids and constant scowl are almost laughable, an' just made him look more fake and unconvincing in the role.  Good thing he only has a few lines.The director of this movie, a young man named Antoine Fuqua, has got a big, bright future ahead of him if this movie is any indication.  He seem to have a knack for creating a hypnotic and dreamlike quality in a film.  The way he opens the movie with the sun rising dissolving into Jake's alarm going off.  That whole first scene with Jake sitting up in bed and looking over at his wife who is feeding their baby in a rocking chair, the dark blue lighting, it's just surreal, almost as if Jake was still in a dream.  And in a sense, he is.  He's at home, cut off from the outside world, and in the dream that he's always had of a comfortable and easygoing life.  But, very soon he will be thrust into a hellish world he could have never imagined.The best dialogue in the movie comes, not surprisingly, from Jake and Alonzo's conversations while they're riding around L.A. in the Monte Carlo.  Especially when they get really heated.  It's two almost TOTALLY different people that are struggling to relate to each other.  One who wants to be a good cop and make an honest paycheck, and one who wants to get the job done and get paid, by any means necessary.This movie is not just your average crime drama or cop thriller, its a movie about morals, about decisions, about the treachory we accept as part of life and the corruption that we all seem to look the other way about.  How long would you be able to go on telling yourself that the ends justify the means, the deeper and darker you go?  I think that's the question Jake kept asking himself.  You can see it in his eyes, the uncertainty about what he agrees to go along with.  You would think he coulda got out of this predicament before he got too far in, but, damn, Alonzo can be one manipulative son of a gun.Now I bought this DVD with a sticker on it that said 'Loaded with Special Features!'  Well, I was a little disappointed in that matter, because it's not really loaded.  The featurette is nothing really special, and is only about 15 minutes long.  The deleted scenes are definitely require watching material, because some of 'em are great and delve even deeper into both Alonzo and Jake.  The alternate ending is more like an extended ending, because it doesn't change anything about the outcome.  It's a quick, but I thought crucial, conversation and I personally think it shoulda been kept in the final cut.  It brought the story full-circle.This movie is not for the squeamish or for the conservatives, because it sometimes does seem to be sending mixed messages, which is one of the reasons I think it was a mistake to not include that final conversation in the ending, because it really evened out the rough edges quite a bit.  Nevertheless, this is one of the best films of last year, featuring two of the best performances of last year, so don't hesitate to pick it up.",5,"""Look in either one of 'em, an' pay the

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 8]","What may seem on paper as a run of the mill, crooked cop drama is brought to the screen almost brilliantly thanks to the unbelievably superb performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.  Hawke plays idealistic rookie cop Jake Hoyt, assigned to partner with veteran NARC Alonzo Harris (Washington) for his first training day in Los Angeles.  As the day goes on, Hoyt watches in awe and horror as he learns an ultimate lesson he'll never forget: sometimes the best cops can go very, very bad.  Washington is sincerely frightening in his role as the crooked cop Harris who believes he must do whatever he can to survive.  Hawke is nearly as great in his role as well, but while the film does start out as a great character study, it has a more than predictable climax and ending that doesn't suit the rest of the film well.  Director Antoine Fuqua, who helmed The Replacement Killers, seems to be finding his directorial niche and moves the film at a nice pace.  Washington would receive his first (and more than overdue) Best Actor Academy Award while Hawke received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yullin, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray, and Peter Greene also have major and supporting roles in the film.

And yet, it is so entertaining and so powerful that you would not believe Denzel Washington's performance in this movie until you have seen it! And speaking of his performance, you get to see a side of Denzel that you have never seen before...as the bad guy! That's right! Washington stars as veteran Detective Sargeant Alonzo Harris, a ""lone wolf"" cop that, to him, has spent too many years obeying the law, etc., that he goes over the edge (a.k.a. ""crossing the line""). This film is also about a fresh-faced LAPD rookie named Jake Hoyt (an excellent Ethan Hawke), who is anxious to join the elite narcotics squad headed up by none other than Harris himself. So Harris has agreed to give Hoyt a shot at joining his team with a one-day ride-along during which Hoyt must prove his mettle if he wants to make it into narcotics. As the day wears on, however, it becomes increasingly clear to the greenhorn that Hoyt's experienced mentor has blurred the line between right and wrong to an alarming degree, enforcing his own morally compromised code of ethics and street justice. In conclusion, I would like to say that ""Training Day"" is nothing short of being intense.

586421,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00005JKEC,OverTheMoon,"[2, 2]","Training Day works because it is pure fantasy masquerading as a reality. The film bends our suspension of disbelief at every moment. We all know that police corruption is a real thing but Lord if a character like Denzel ever walked the street of L.A like that for real he would be dead in a few months. The same goes for Hawke. Both these characters would have a life-span of a Star Trek extra who beams down to the strange planet with the rest of the party.Denzel practically walks and drives the streets like he owns L.A. The man can go down any alley, go into any house, shot up any gang, beat up rapists, steal money, abuse criminals and have some extra debauchery on the side... all before cornflakes. Ethan Hawke is just a way out his depth as a rookie who gives new meaning that that word. A boy playing the donkey to such extremes that the carrot almost brings him to murder 'cause Denzel orders it.What makes Training Day so good is that it blends so much reality with so much fantasy that the line blurs to the point where the two are no longer distinguishable. Then the director Antoine Fuqua can play with us all he likes by having the main protagonist abuse the rookie cop at every given opportunity. We buy it. We buy it all and ask for more. Fuqua then gives it to us by taking the whole police corruption element to new heights as a plot involving bent-cop-drug-dealers become the bait and main meal of the day. They even have totally outrageous names like - The Sandman, but still we think that what we are seeing is reality. Fuqua just has us wearing blinkers all the way as he directs us through the streets of crime with Denzel coming up with some of the most memorable lines in a cop drama ever.The acting is all dark but good. This is a highly enjoyable romp, albeit a totally improbable one, but high-camp stories do not mean high-camp acting. This could well be the B-Movie of cop dramas, but it is just done so well. All the characters are radical and excessive. The plot is almost comic book quality. The ending is totally Hollywood in every department.This is just a great fantasy cop movie that is worthy of repeat viewings. Fuqua is the master of the suspension of the disbelief here.

Washington plays aganist type as Detective Alonzo Harris, a roaving detective who leads his own squad of hard case/corrupt officers in a quest to clean up the streets a bit, and profit from it alot.The story takes place in one day in LA, as Washington ostensibly trains officer Jake Hoyt, played by Ethan Hawke, for duty on his squad.  Hoyt wants the job, admires Harris, and wants to make a name for himself.  As Harris takes him through the day, we see Hoyt tested again and again, and pushed to the breaking point by a commander who assures him that everything is just a test.Overall, the movie is very watchable.  The cinematography and direction are excellent, and one gets a feel for the hard side of Los Angeles.  There are inspired supporting turns, from Snoop Dog, Dr. Dre, and Scott Glen.  Sadly, the writing is not quite up to snuff, and it falls upon th relationship between Hawke and Washington to carry the film.  Hawke is meerly a decent actor in a cliched ""good cop"" role.  He is defined by the morality he apparently gre up with.  His Oscar nomination was an insult to Gene Hackman's brilliant turn in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".  Washington, however, deserves all the praise he ahs recieved.  He is at the same time vicious, sympathetic, and professional, and his good-natured badness drives the film, and keeps it from falling apart.  I don't think Denzel deserved the oscar.  Russell Crowe gave a much better performance in the otherwise dull ""A Beautiful Mind"", but his recieving it is no crime.  He makes the movie work as well as he can.The movie loses it's way in the final act, with an ending telegraphed from early on, and the resolution to one storyline is such a Dues ex Machina that it pulled me out of the film for a bit.

He gets teamed with Alonzo Harris (Mr. Washington) who is more crooked than the criminals themselves.

586435,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JKEC,Reviewer,"[14, 17]","A brutal and disturbing film that attempts to connect you with the underbelly of the streets of downtown Los Angeles, while examining that fragile, thin line between those who enforce the law and those who break it, ""Training Day,"" directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a cautionary morality tale that decidedly points out that what you do and who you are is a matter of free will and personal choice.  Beyond the action, it's a study of human nature that explores the necessity of having a moral code by which to live, especially when confronted with that age-old seductress Evil, who can lure even the best of the best across that line from which there is no return.  The most disconcerting aspect of the film, however, is in it's portrayal of those in high places who with facility betray those they are sworn to serve and protect, with their flagrant abuse of their position and power, and moreover, seemingly always manage to hold the high ground of advantage over those against whom their misdeeds are perpetrated.  Indeed, the burden of proof must always fall to the good guy, and more often than not it is those endowed with a more positive, benevolent nature-- the ones who want to do the right thing-- that find justice elusive and become victims themselves, if only because of their refusal to compromise their own principles.  And that is really what is at the heart of Fuqua's film, which very probably will take many viewers to a place they would rather not be.  But, as Steve McQueen said in ""Bullitt,"" when asked by his girlfriend how he can stand doing a job that keeps him so close to the gutter, ""That's where half of it is--""  And in today's world, unfortunately, it may well be that the percentage is even higher; which somewhat elevates the significance of this film.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a nineteen month veteran of the L.A.P.D., is about to begin his first day on a new assignment, having landed a spot in the Narcotics Division, where he will be a member of a small squad under the direction of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington)-- if he measures up to Alonzo's stringent expectations.  It's a job he wants, because he sees it as an opportunity to really do some good in the community; it's a place from which he can help rid the streets of drug dealers and other felons.  But he quickly discovers that-- as most worthwhile things are in life-- it's just not that easy.  As Alonzo is quick to point out, ""If you want to protect the sheep from the wolf, you have to become a wolf.  It's the wolf that catches the wolf--""  Jake also learns that on this day he's going to have to make a lot of decisions, and make them quickly, without the luxury of time to consider all of the possible ramifications.  And one of them is put to him directly by Alonzo, who tells him he's going to have to decide what he wants to be, a sheep-- or a wolf.  It's something he's going to have to know by the end of the day; and Jake doesn't know it going in, but this day, his ""Training Day,"" is going to be a day that will change his life forever.Fuqua's film is presented honestly and in such a way that it successfully puts the viewer on the streets of L.A., and Jake and Alonzo are credible characters; but the motivation behind Alonzo's ruthlessness is fairly anemic and under-developed.  The weakness of the film, in fact, lies in the screenplay (by David Ayer), which though it captures a certain sense of ""street-wise"" reality, is otherwise rather formulaic and doesn't really have the depth it needs to make it emotionally involving.  ...As Alonzo, Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance-- and, quite frankly, this film would be less than average without him-- but whether or not it is deserving of an Oscar is open to speculation.  Washington is one of the finest actors in the business, without question, and he's taken on some challenging roles (in which he's been very successful) that make this part pale by comparison.  Alonzo Harris is more along the lines of Mel Gibson's Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon,"" or Eastwood's Harry in ""Dirty Harry,"" the difference being that Alonzo is the bad guy.  It's a credit to Washington's ability that he was able to make this such a strong character, however, and his Alonzo is certainly believable and real.  And, in retrospect, perhaps it is an Oscar-worthy performance; it had to be to overcome the weakness of the script and what he was given to work with.  And, again, without Denzel Washington, this film plays for two weeks in the theater and is quickly forgotten when it hits the video store shelf.Hawke gives a strong performance, as well, but that he received an Oscar nomination for it is the stuff of which debates are born.  Like Washington, however, Hawke does do a good job of bringing his character to life, and it is one of the strengths of the film.The supporting cast includes Tom Berenger (Stan), Harris Yulin (Doug) and Scott Glenn (Roger).  In the final analysis, ""Training Day"" is elevated by the performances of it's stars; without them, this one has no legs.",3,"Good Performances, Average Film",1017878400,"04 4, 2002",2002,5034,"['brutal', 'disturbing', 'film', 'connect', 'underbelly', 'streets', 'downtown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'examining', 'fragile', 'thin', 'line', 'who', 'enforce', 'law', 'who', 'break', 'Training', 'Day', 'directed', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'cautionary', 'morality', 'tale', 'decidedly', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'who', 'are', 'matter', 'free', 'will', 'personal', 'choice', 'action', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'necessity', 'having', 'moral', 'code', 'live', 'especially', 'when', 'confronted', 'age-old', 'seductress', 'Evil', 'who', 'can', 'lure', 'even', 'best', 'best', 'line', 'return', 'most', 'disconcerting', 'aspect', 'film', 'however', 'portrayal', 'high', 'places', 'who', 'facility', 'betray', 'are', 'sworn', 'serve', 'protect', 'flagrant', 'abuse', 'position', 'power', 'moreover', 'seemingly', 'always', 'manage', 'hold', 'high', 'ground', 'advantage', 'whom', 'misdeeds', 'are', 'perpetrated', 'Indeed', 'burden', 'proof', 'must', 'always', 'fall', 'good', 'guy', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'endowed', 'more', 'positive', 'benevolent', 'nature', 'ones', 'who', 'want', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'find', 'justice', 'elusive', 'become', 'victims', 'only', 'refusal', 'compromise', 'own', 'principles', 'really', 'what', 'heart', 'Fuqua', 'film', 'very', 'probably', 'will', 'take', 'many', 'viewers', 'place', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'be', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'said', 'Bullitt', 'when', 'asked', 'girlfriend', 'how', 'can', 'stand', 'doing', 'job', 'so', 'close', 'gutter', 'where', 'half', 'today', 'world', 'unfortunately', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'percentage', 'even', 'higher', 'somewhat', 'significance', 'film.Jake', 'Hoyt', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'nineteen', 'month', 'veteran', 'L.A.P.D.', 'begin', 'first', 'day', 'new', 'assignment', 'having', 'landed', 'spot', 'Narcotics', 'Division', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'member', 'small', 'squad', 'direction', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'up', 'Alonzo', 'stringent', 'expectations', 'job', 'opportunity', 'really', 'do', 'good', 'community', 'place', 'can', 'help', 'rid', 'streets', 'drug', 'dealers', 'other', 'felons', 'quickly', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'things', 'are', 'life', 'just', 'not', 'easy', 'Alonzo', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'want', 'protect', 'sheep', 'wolf', 'have', 'become', 'wolf', 'wolf', 'wolf', 'Jake', 'also', 'day', 'going', 'have', 'make', 'lot', 'decisions', 'make', 'quickly', 'luxury', 'time', 'consider', 'possible', 'ramifications', 'one', 'put', 'directly', 'Alonzo', 'who', 'going', 'have', 'decide', 'what', 'be', 'sheep', 'wolf', 'something', 'going', 'have', 'know', 'end', 'day', 'Jake', ""n't"", 'know', 'going', 'day', 'Training', 'Day', 'going', 'be', 'day', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'forever.Fuqua', 'film', 'presented', 'honestly', 'such', 'way', 'successfully', 'viewer', 'streets', 'L.A.', 'Jake', 'Alonzo', 'are', 'credible', 'characters', 'motivation', 'Alonzo', 'ruthlessness', 'fairly', 'anemic', 'under-developed', 'weakness', 'film', 'fact', 'screenplay', 'David', 'Ayer', 'certain', 'sense', 'street-wise', 'reality', 'otherwise', 'rather', 'formulaic', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'depth', 'make', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'Alonzo', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'excellent', 'performance', 'quite', 'frankly', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'average', 'not', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'open', 'speculation', 'Washington', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'business', 'question', 'taken', 'challenging', 'roles', 'been', 'very', 'successful', 'make', 'part', 'pale', 'comparison', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'more', 'lines', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Riggs', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Eastwood', 'Harry', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'difference', 'being', 'Alonzo', 'bad', 'guy', 'credit', 'Washington', 'ability', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'such', 'strong', 'character', 'however', 'Alonzo', 'certainly', 'believable', 'real', 'retrospect', 'perhaps', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'had', 'be', 'overcome', 'weakness', 'script', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'work', 'again', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'film', 'two', 'weeks', 'theater', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'when', 'video', 'store', 'shelf.Hawke', 'strong', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'stuff', 'debates', 'are', 'born', 'Washington', 'however', 'Hawke', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'character', 'life', 'one', 'strengths', 'film.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Stan', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'Doug', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Roger', 'final', 'analysis', 'Training', 'Day', 'elevated', 'performances', 'stars', 'one', 'legs']",N/A

The movie takes us through the first day on the undercover narcotics squad of LAPD officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), who's riding along with the head of the unit, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). It doesn't take too long before Hoyt realizes that the life of an undercover officer ain't what gets taught at the police academy.As should be obvious, comparisons to Dennis Hopper's brilliant 1988 film Colors are inevitable, and they're warranted. Screenwriter David Ayer (U-571, The Fast and the Furious) had to realize while writing this that the comparisons were going to happen, and there are few films, especially cop films, that won't suffer in comparison. Ayer uses the one-day timeframe as one of the differences between the two films; he also adds a couple of subplots, some that work, some that don't. But like Colors, the true basis of the film is an exploration of the personalities of the two main characters, how they conflict, and how the older cop (Washington, in this case, playing the same role Robert Duvall did in the earlier movie) has to combine the wisdom of the law officer with the street sensibility of the thug in order to survive from day to day, much less actually get anything done.While Hawke and Washington don't have the same chemistry as Duvall and Penn, Training Day doesn't hit you over the head with its plot quite as hard as Colors did. It also avoids the morality-tale mentalityuntil the last twenty minutes or so of the film (one wonders, idly, if the film had a different ending originally and got a re-shoot after test-marketing). Alonzo Harris is a bad guy, pure and simple (and it's refreshing to see Denzel Washington play someone who's not squeaky-clean), but that doesn't make him any less competent at his job, or any less believable when dispensing various bits of homily on how to survive as an undercover narcotics officer. It also makes the first portion of the film's climax (surprisingly long and surprisingly interest-holding) that much more unexpected when it finally does occur.And herein, actually, is the one place the film really screws up. Training Day's climax opens with one hell of a large coincidence which could have been derailed at any one of a number of places along the way, and some of the characters in the film have to slip out of character at times in order for the coincidence to take shape (note that this is unnoticeable until the event in question happens, but it leaves a slightly sour aftertaste). A little rewriting earlier in the film might have solved this problem.One last note of comparison between the two is in the uniformly high quality of the supporting casts in both films. In Training Day, Fuqua gives us a number of folks who are starting to pop up in a lot ofsupporting roles these days, from the surprisingly talented Snoop Dogg to the big-screen debut of MacyGray (with better hair than usual, and thus unrecognizable). Special attention should be paid to Eva Mendes as Denzel's main squeeze and Cliff Curtis (last seen by a wide audience torturing Mark Wahlberg in Three Kings) as one of his top informants. Curtis, especially, is on his way up in the world, and fast.Overall, there are enough errors in Training Day to still make Colors the better film, but this was onefine shot at the title. After viewing, let it sink in for a while, as its full measure takes a while and some reflection to settle in. *** 1/2",4,"Baby did a bad, bad thing.",1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,3666,"['Training', 'Day', 'Antione', 'Fuqua', '2001', '[', 'originally', 'posted', '5Nov2001', ']', 'Fuqua', 'who', 'directed', 'scores', 'music', 'videos', 'made', 'big-screen', 'debut', 'impressive', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'vehicle', 'Replacement', 'Killers', '1998', 'up', 'most', 'recent', 'flick', 'Training', 'Day', 'movie', 'first', 'day', 'undercover', 'narcotics', 'squad', 'LAPD', 'officer', 'Jake', 'Hoyt', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'riding', 'along', 'head', 'unit', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'Denzel', 'Washington', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'before', 'Hoyt', 'life', 'undercover', 'officer', 'ai', ""n't"", 'what', 'taught', 'police', 'academy.As', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'comparisons', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'brilliant', '1988', 'film', 'Colors', 'are', 'inevitable', ""'re"", 'warranted', 'Screenwriter', 'David', 'Ayer', 'U-571', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'had', 'realize', 'writing', 'comparisons', 'were', 'going', 'happen', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'especially', 'cop', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'comparison', 'Ayer', 'one-day', 'timeframe', 'one', 'differences', 'two', 'films', 'also', 'couple', 'subplots', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'Colors', 'true', 'basis', 'film', 'exploration', 'personalities', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'how', 'conflict', 'how', 'older', 'cop', 'Washington', 'case', 'playing', 'same', 'role', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'did', 'earlier', 'movie', 'combine', 'wisdom', 'law', 'officer', 'street', 'sensibility', 'thug', 'order', 'survive', 'day', 'day', 'much', 'less', 'actually', 'get', 'anything', 'done.While', 'Hawke', 'Washington', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'chemistry', 'Duvall', 'Penn', 'Training', 'Day', ""n't"", 'hit', 'head', 'plot', 'quite', 'as', 'hard', 'Colors', 'did', 'also', 'morality-tale', 'mentalityuntil', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'one', 'wonders', 'idly', 'film', 'had', 'different', 'ending', 'originally', 'got', 're-shoot', 'test-marketing', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'bad', 'guy', 'pure', 'simple', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'play', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'squeaky-clean', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'competent', 'job', 'less', 'believable', 'when', 'dispensing', 'various', 'bits', 'homily', 'how', 'survive', 'undercover', 'narcotics', 'officer', 'also', 'first', 'portion', 'film', 'climax', 'surprisingly', 'long', 'surprisingly', 'interest-holding', 'much', 'more', 'unexpected', 'when', 'finally', 'occur.And', 'herein', 'actually', 'one', 'place', 'film', 'really', 'up', 'Training', 'Day', 'climax', 'one', 'hell', 'large', 'coincidence', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'derailed', 'one', 'number', 'places', 'way', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'slip', 'character', 'times', 'order', 'coincidence', 'take', 'shape', 'note', 'unnoticeable', 'event', 'question', 'happens', 'slightly', 'sour', 'aftertaste', 'little', 'rewriting', 'earlier', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'solved', 'problem.One', 'last', 'note', 'comparison', 'two', 'uniformly', 'high', 'quality', 'supporting', 'casts', 'films', 'Training', 'Day', 'Fuqua', 'number', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'starting', 'pop', 'up', 'lot', 'ofsupporting', 'roles', 'days', 'surprisingly', 'talented', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'big-screen', 'debut', 'MacyGray', 'better', 'hair', 'usual', 'thus', 'unrecognizable', 'Special', 'attention', 'should', 'be', 'paid', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Denzel', 'main', 'squeeze', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'last', 'seen', 'wide', 'audience', 'torturing', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Three', 'Kings', 'one', 'top', 'informants', 'Curtis', 'especially', 'way', 'up', 'world', 'fast.Overall', 'are', 'enough', 'errors', 'Training', 'Day', 'still', 'make', 'Colors', 'better', 'film', 'was', 'onefine', 'shot', 'title', 'viewing', 'let', 'sink', 'while', 'full', 'measure', 'while', 'reflection', 'settle', '1/2']",N/A

I am giving this movie three stars for one and only one reason: Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke are spectacular. Unfortunately, that is about the only positive thing I can say about this move. If not for their work, I would probably be giving this one star. Denzel Washington turns in one of his best performances ever, but unfortunately the character he plays is a dreadfully unattractive one. He is an amoralistic, out-of-control thug. Hawke holds his own with Denzel, and manages a more likable character. But watching this film was an intensely unpleasant experience. My friends and I watched it merely to see why Denzel won his Best Actor Oscar. We agreed he deserved it, but even near the very beginning we kept asking, ""Is this thing going to get any better?""The day after I saw this film, I tried watching bits of two other Denzel Washington films I had previously seen and enjoyed. One was THE PELICAN BRIEF and the other COURAGE UNDER FIRE. I was quite surprised to find that I was responding very negatively to seeing Denzel on screen. I realized that this was testimony to his incredibly convincing job as a total slime ball in TRAINING DAY. I plan soon on doing a Denzel film festival, watching two or three of his best films, just so I can get back to liking the guy again.So I don't know whether to recommend this to others or not. I guess I'll say, it is worth seeing for two great performances, but don't expect to have a good time.

586446,A34DPXEGCFNZF4,B00005JKEC,Rock,"[13, 13]","I've had many conversations with my friends about this movie. Conversations turned into debates. Debates turned into arguments. And there are many, many things to argue about concerning this particular movie, which I guess is part of its allure, at least for me. Whether it was realistic or not. Whether Denzel's performance, while indisputably good, was Oscar-worthy or not. Whether it was too violent, or simply a portrayal of the violence that goes on every day in a big city.One at a time.I believe this movie is realistic in all aspects dealing with the situations on the street. There are vicious people who's kill you just as soon as look at you. People who are out to get your money and your livelihood. People out to take your heart, sometimes literally. I believe that there are no clear-cut right or wrong answers out on the street. You just have to stick to some basic code of conduct and hope everything works itself out. I believe that not all cops are the knights-in-shining-armor people would like them to be in this post-September 11th world. That's probably not the most fashionable thing to say right now, but that's what I believe. I believe that mostly good and decent men can be corrupted by that sense of power and authority. And since my father was a cop in West Philly for 20 years, I have a pretty fair basis for my beliefs.Whether Denzel's performance was Oscar-worthy or not... I don't put much stock in the Academy Awards myself. Usually, the Academy's criteria and mine differ a great deal. But they are supposed to reward people for excellence in film, and on that basis, Denzel certainly did deserve it. You could see the subtle shifts in Alonzo's character from scene to scene. Now, I didn't believe the character was stereotypical. If anything could be construed as stereotypical, it was his street persona. But that was only a persona, only a part of the character. It was the glimpses of the good man still lurking inside that made the character fresh and original. There isn't another actor working today that could've captured all those nuances. No Hopkins, no DeNiro, no Pacino, no Rush... nobody. He most definitely earned that Oscar, for what it's worth. And even if--IF--it was only a ""freebie"" for ignoring his tour-de-force performance as Malcolm X, it was certainly no different from Russell Crowe's situation last year, when he won for ""Gladiator"" after being passed over for ""The Insider"" a year before. And that reparation didn't even have the added wrinkle of any white actors having been ignored for 3 decades.About the violence... I've never lived in LA. I've never even been off the East Coast, so I can't say I know how it is there. But I do know how it is here. This movie has no more violence in it than anything you might see on 52nd Street, or K & A, or 5th and Lehigh, or the Badlands, or even Broad and Olney, where I saw a crackhead jump on the hood of a man's car and promptly get the [stuff] beaten out of him. (If you live in Philly, or have ever lived here for an extended period, you know the areas I'm talking about.) It's not violent for the sake of violence, like other Hollywood movies. It's violent because it's a reflection of a certain lifestyle which happens to be very violent sometimes. That's what I believe.Now I don't think that my opinion will change anybody's mind about this movie one way or the other, but maybe it'll help you see the other side of the argument. But if you haven't seen the movie, don't let this review or any other review sway you.

586448,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JKEC,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 12]","***1/2  Denzel Washington earned his Best Actor Oscar in ""Training Day"" portraying a veteran LAPD narcotics officer who has become every bit as hard, amoral and corrupt as the mean city streets he patrols.  We've seen plenty of ""bad apple"" cops in movies before, but rarely one as chillingly complex as Alonzo Harris, a man who long ago abandoned any of the crime-fighting idealism that led him to the job in the first place.  Harris has learned that to deal with bad people one has to become bad oneself, and he has no compunction against going outside the law if that is the only way to get what he wants.  For while he may piously declare that he is only beating the criminals at their own game, the truth is that Harris has simply sold his soul to the same self-centered greed that motivates the criminals he is supposedly after.Writer David Ayer provides Harris with the perfect foil for him to go up against in the form of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who has been assigned to be the veteran's partner.  Feeling that he is finally going to be able to fulfill his lifelong dream of helping to make the world a better place, Jake is in for a very rude awakening once he comes up against the hardboiled cynicism of this more-than-he-bargained-for partner.  Filled with the understandable jitters and self-doubt that come with the first day on the job, Jake quickly comes to see that there is something not quite right with Harris, who spends much of the day breaking laws, flaunting procedures and even threatening Jake's life if he doesn't go along with the many nefarious plans and schemes he has up his sleeves.  Of course, Harris attempts to seduce Jake over to his way of thinking by arguing that such ""unconventional"" actions are required to circumvent a legal system that hamstrings officers with its bureaucratic rules and obsession with civil rights violations.  Or is this just a convenient excuse for Harris to justify his lawbreaking?  The film is, in many ways, more interesting as a study of Jake's character than of Harris', as we wonder if Jake will come to accept Harris' seasoned viewpoint or somehow see through it and remain true to his ideals.""Training Day"" is filled with scenes of great dramatic intensity, often times based on some legitimate moral dilemma that Jake finds himself confronting.  The mercurial nature of Harris' behavior keeps us as bewildered and off guard as it does Jake, for like him, we really don't know what exactly Harris wants or where he is coming from.  Such moral ambiguity is a sign of powerful storytelling and Ayer deserves a great deal of credit for bringing some depth to an overworked genre.  However, at times the film feels a bit forced and strains credibility just when we most need to believe in its truthfulness.  This is particularly the case in a scene in which Jake is about to be blown away in a bathtub and receives a last minute reprieve in the form of a coincidence too preposterous to be even slightly believable.  Moreover, some of Harris' actions - though valid for the point that the film is trying to make perhaps - seem highly unlikely in the real world.  The overall effect of them is to throw the audience out of the movie just when we are most eager to go where we feel it is taking us.  However, these are minor quibbles about a film that works so well for so much of the time.As this is the film that won Washington his Academy Award, we must not fail to mention the superb performances delivered by both him and Ethan Hawke as Jake.  Washington, generally relegated to ""good guy"" roles, proves himself a deft villain in this case, displaying the many intricate coils of his seething, cobra-like character.  In many ways, though, Hawke does the more impressive job, partly because he has been given the less flamboyant role of passive observer.  Washington gets to hit all the dramatic heights, yet, it is through Jake's eyes that the audience gets to observe this lethal individual and Hawke provides the understated richness that brings this everyman character to life.  As Jake gets more and more intricately ensnared and embroiled in Harris' immoral actions, we can't help but identify with the ethical plight being thrust on this man who just wants to do what he knows - or thinks he knows - is right.  These two fine actors provide the explosive, symbiotic partnership that brings the screenplay to vivid life.Director Antoine Fuqua makes each moment count dramatically, whether it be a tense confrontation between Harris and Jake over an issue of great moral consequence or a subtle moment of quiet reflection as Jake contemplates his next move.Despite the fact that the film seems to strain a bit at the edges (one wonders what Jake's SECOND day on the job will be like), ""Training Day"" provides more food for thought than your average cop buddy movie -

There is no sublety to the acting. Just a lot of yelling, screaming, spitting and mugging. I was shocked that so many seem so impressed.Training day is about a once good cop gone bad, real bad. Ethan hawk plays the unsuspecting rookie who is about to have a life changing experience. He finds his tutor to be violent, corrupt to the core and even deadly. Plant some evidence to make a case? No problem. Skim a little drug money off the top? No problem there either but the real turning point in the movie is when the denzel character executes a drug dealer. He's just scum anyway was the rationalization. Keep in mind this is all happening on a rookie's first day as a narc! No attempt to work him in gradually into this corrupt world. Eventually(of course) the young cop rebels against these injustices and almost loses his life becuase of what he knows. Then he turns on his teacherThe plot of the film seems too politically motivated and forced. You have this psychopathic bad guy black cop and the well meaning young white cop with unrealistic ideals. Watching this film you may be lead to believe that entire police forces are corrupt and all the men sitting in prison are just victims of corruption. Yeah right.When the hawk's character turns on his teacher and tries to bring him to justice the movie has a chance to shine. It doesn't. You have the typical struggle and an ending that is dumber than you can believe. Here is hawk's character holding a gun on denzel in the street. A large crowd of neighborhood people are around the scence now and almost all of them are black. They reject denzel's pleas to help one of their own because of what he has done to their community. He screams that he will ""make a case"" against all of them and there is that infamous line ""I'm the police, you just live here."" The end comes when hawk's character returns home dejected that all he dreamed of and all his ideals are lost. The crooked denzel cop meets his end when an assasination squad with automatic weapons come upon him and fire at his car. In an idiotic scene right out of the godfather denzel, just like sonny corelone emerges from his vehicle and dies only after another barrage of bullets riddle his body. Aside from the unrealistic possibility that a guy with 150 bullets in him could get out of a car and stand, that death scence represents the most horrible acting i have ever seen out of denzel washington with his mouth slung open and his final stagger he looks more drunk than dying. Horrible.Actually it is ethan hawk who has the challenging role and he pulls it off fairly well. He has to begin the film as an idealistic nervous cop who gradually becomes disappionted, disgusted, outraged and then enraged. In the end his whole life is shattered his career, all his dreams. A point that isn't even given 2 minutes time. It takes a more mercurial performance to play that part.Over all training day is a mediocre film with decent acting, decent action and a flawed plot. The end was a huge disappointment.",3,Mediocre....,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,3164,"[""C'mon"", 'people', 'denzel', 'deserved', 'oscar', 'performance', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'many', 'more', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', '10th', 'best', 'sublety', 'acting', 'Just', 'lot', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'spitting', 'mugging', 'was', 'shocked', 'so', 'many', 'seem', 'so', 'impressed.Training', 'day', 'once', 'good', 'cop', 'gone', 'bad', 'real', 'bad', 'Ethan', 'hawk', 'unsuspecting', 'rookie', 'who', 'have', 'life', 'changing', 'experience', 'tutor', 'be', 'violent', 'corrupt', 'core', 'even', 'deadly', 'Plant', 'evidence', 'make', 'case', 'problem', 'Skim', 'little', 'drug', 'money', 'top', 'problem', 'there', 'either', 'real', 'turning', 'point', 'movie', 'when', 'denzel', 'character', 'drug', 'dealer', 'just', 'scum', 'anyway', 'was', 'rationalization', 'Keep', 'mind', 'happening', 'rookie', 'first', 'day', 'narc', 'No', 'attempt', 'work', 'gradually', 'corrupt', 'world', 'Eventually', 'course', 'young', 'cop', 'rebels', 'injustices', 'almost', 'life', 'becuase', 'what', 'Then', 'teacherThe', 'plot', 'film', 'too', 'politically', 'motivated', 'forced', 'have', 'psychopathic', 'bad', 'guy', 'black', 'cop', 'well', 'meaning', 'young', 'white', 'cop', 'unrealistic', 'ideals', 'Watching', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'lead', 'believe', 'entire', 'police', 'forces', 'are', 'corrupt', 'men', 'sitting', 'prison', 'are', 'just', 'victims', 'corruption', 'Yeah', 'hawk', 'character', 'teacher', 'tries', 'bring', 'justice', 'movie', 'chance', 'shine', ""n't"", 'have', 'typical', 'struggle', 'ending', 'dumber', 'can', 'believe', 'Here', 'hawk', 'character', 'holding', 'gun', 'denzel', 'street', 'large', 'crowd', 'neighborhood', 'people', 'are', 'scence', 'now', 'almost', 'are', 'black', 'reject', 'denzel', 'pleas', 'help', 'one', 'own', 'what', 'done', 'community', 'will', 'make', 'case', 'infamous', 'line', ""'m"", 'police', 'just', 'live', 'here', 'end', 'when', 'hawk', 'character', 'home', 'dejected', 'dreamed', 'ideals', 'are', 'lost', 'crooked', 'denzel', 'cop', 'end', 'when', 'assasination', 'squad', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'come', 'fire', 'car', 'idiotic', 'scene', 'right', 'godfather', 'denzel', 'just', 'sonny', 'corelone', 'vehicle', 'only', 'barrage', 'bullets', 'riddle', 'body', 'Aside', 'unrealistic', 'possibility', 'guy', '150', 'bullets', 'could', 'get', 'car', 'stand', 'death', 'scence', 'most', 'horrible', 'acting', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'denzel', 'washington', 'mouth', 'slung', 'open', 'final', 'stagger', 'more', 'drunk', 'dying', 'Horrible.Actually', 'ethan', 'hawk', 'who', 'challenging', 'role', 'off', 'fairly', 'well', 'begin', 'film', 'idealistic', 'nervous', 'cop', 'who', 'gradually', 'disappionted', 'disgusted', 'outraged', 'then', 'enraged', 'end', 'whole', 'life', 'shattered', 'career', 'dreams', 'point', ""n't"", 'even', 'given', '2', 'minutes', 'time', 'more', 'mercurial', 'performance', 'play', 'part.Over', 'training', 'day', 'mediocre', 'film', 'decent', 'acting', 'decent', 'action', 'flawed', 'plot', 'end', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment']",N/A

In this movie, a curropted cop gets a rookie, and tries to get him mixed in with his problems.  These are the main characters.Alanzo Harris:Denzel won his first best actor's award ever(He won best supporting actor in Glory), and I see why, good acting, with using a lot of good metaphors and stuff.  He may seem like a good narcotics officer, but his actions will get him killed, unless he can pay off his debts.  But before he does that, he needs a pawn in his game.Jake:Ethan Hawke played good in this movie too as a rookie cop.  He gets his chance at being a narcotics officer, thanks to Alanzo.  He has to show what he can prove in 24 hours, but a lot of bumps are up the road, and it prooves he's scared to find out the shocking truth.The movie got off to a great start, and had very good twists, but when it rolled towards the end, it started to fall apart, and I was a pretty dissapointed how the movie ended, but Denzel stayed true to his acting roots all throughout the movie.

586456,AD29KEJMCAD76,B00005JKEC,Samhot,"[0, 0]","Denzel Washington pretty much does a first this time around, as he plays a villainous corrupt narcotics detective named Alonzo on the mean streets of Los Angeles. He then takes an ambitious but good-hearted rookie named Jake (played by Ethan Hawke) under his wing, on a tutorial, and shows him the routine of a narcotics detective. However, Alonzo has quite a few obstacles in store for Jake, and not the least of them is witnessing some of Alonzo's brutal police tactics.Joseph Sigmond wrote a very descriptive, in-depth review on January 13, 2003 for this movie. However, I don't really want to spill every single detail on the film and ruin it for somebody who hasn't seen the movie yet, but things twist and turn, and eventually the bad that was done seems to be compensated for (at least on Alonzo's part.) If there was a moral or lesson to be learned on this 'training day,' it seemed to be: you reap what you sow.The scenes and dialogue get quite graphic at times, so I wouldn't advise the faint of heart to view this film. Just a warning. As far as performances are concerned, Washington won an award for his performance in this, as it was a first for him to play an extremely menacing character, and he plays it quite convincingly well. Hawke did an excellent job as the good-hearted rookie, and it was quite interesting seeing his temperamental swing (at the end of the movie) contrasted with the innocence he seemed to portray throughout the movie.While a crime drama, there's plenty of humor found here, but the humor is quite scathingly dark and sinister.Also features appearances from superstars Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Macy Gray. Most of the time, musicians make appearances in films, and don't leave much of an impression (other than the fact that they're famous), but what's interesting is how well each of these respective musicians' characters fit well into the story, and each give perfectly convincing performances, as opposed to just being objects of show, possibly to attract extra attention to the film.

It's a 5 star movie but the transfer quality rates only 3 stars.'Training Day' on BluRay was better than I expected once the disc was in. The Mbps rate ranged between the low teens and mid twenties at best. You would expect to see a lot of grain in this film, especially because there were so many dark scenes but the transfer wasn't bad and had good, warm color grading, natural skin tones and was free from artifacts, dirt or ghosting. However, I did see in one scene where the car turns right in front of some overhanging phone/electric lines some very real stair-stepping in the lines themselves. My gut feeling is that the transfer to blu ray was just that, a transfer without any serious remastering. This means that the Standard Def version wasn't bad either and I doubt you would see much difference from the upgrade to Blu Ray.The lack of an upgrade of the audio bolsters my thoughts on this. The audio is lossy Dolby Digital 5.1. You can get used to listening to lossy audio until you hear the difference between it and a  lossless version. Very disappointed in the audio, not because the levels were poor or the dialogue unintelligible, but because the panning and use of the discreet channels for foley fx would have been greatly enhanced if the audio had been a lossless one. However, most of the audio is strictly across the front stage. Great movie though and too bad it was not really remastered.

Alonzo is basically a criminal with a badge, out to get other criminals by any means necessary, yet putting his own needs before the ""sheep"" he claims to protect. Jake wants to make detective, and follows Alonzo around doing his bidding to gain that coveted badge.The story takes place in one day - because that's all Jake has to prove to Alonzo he's worthy of the job. It's a dreary rainy day in Los Angeles, a perfect way to emphasize the darkness possessed by Alonzo's soul. He is a man on a mission, and with his badge and bravado he rules the streets of LA.Without giving anything away, the two actors are magnificent in this film. Both of them are completely believable in their roles. As a viewer, you sometimes find yourself agreeing with and sympathizing with Alonzo as he takes Jake down the dark road that lies ahead of them - until the end.Denzel Washington won his first Academy Award as Best Actor (he won for Best Supporting Actor in Glory) playing the role of Alonzo.

It struck me that, in an odd way, this was indicative of progress for African-Americans. They had to have access to the inside in order to be indicted for it. In the old days, they never would have had those doors opened in the first place.Which brings me to &quot;Training Day&quot;, in which Denzel Washington delivers an astonishingly good performance as a totally corrupt and evil L.A. cop. The fact that an African-American leading man is portrayed as the &quot;bad guy&quot; is truly groundbreaking, and just another reason to look at this film and be in awe of it. In the same strange twist as the stock broker, here we see a black cop who has all the doors of sin open to him. Like the white cops of the Jim Crow South, he takes to corruption in a way that has no skin color. It is the story of humanity, temptation and power.Blacks on film have for a number of years now been shown either one way or the other. There is no shortage of depictions of black drug dealers, gangbangers and &quot;homies.&quot; Hollywood then tries to make up for it by portraying blacks as doctors, lawyers, voices of conscience or reason, and the most frequent stereotype, the &quot;tough but fair police commander.&quot;The negative portrayals of blacks, however, were never played by big name actors. Washington himself has built a career as a guy more or less saving the world in &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; and &quot;Fallen&quot;. His flaws in &quot;Ricochet&quot; are brought out only by a vindictive white man (John Lithgow). In &quot;Training Day&quot;, Denzel is all on his charismatic own, a product of a world that he is convinced revolves around him. By choosing to pursue this amazing role, Denzel demonstrates the kind of courage that is rare among actors.Think of Robert Redford, for instance. Redford never let his hair down. He played heroes and fantasy figures. Every so often, however, a superstar will break type. Paul Newman did it in &quot;Hud&quot;. So did Robert Duvall in &quot;The Great Santini&quot;.What is even more astonishing in &quot;Training Day&quot; is not just that a black guy is the bad guy, but a white guy (Ethan Hawke) is a clearly marked, unfettered hero, placed in utter contrast and opposition to the villain. &quot;Candy Man&quot;, a B movie franchise of the early 1990s, featured the politically explosive portrayal of a black man slicing and dicing his way through white women, but this was hardly big time fare.&quot;Training Day&quot; takes all the Political Correctness of the past 20 years and explodes it. Hawke not only is innocent and good in contrast with Denzel, but he is a Lancelot-type figure who comes to the aid of a Latino-girl-in-distress, and later faces torture and terror at the hands of a group of Mexican gangbangers. The actors who portray these guys are so good, so real and so terrifying that if you met them on the streets, even knowing they were just acting, you would be a little frightened.By no means does &quot;Training Day&quot; leave the viewer groping with the uncomfortable notion that &quot;white is right.&quot; The performances are too real and too powerful. It is only in retrospect that one realizes this is truly groundbreaking stuff. Denzel Washington is extraordinary. His performance in this film is among the very best ever seen. There are not enough superlatives, not enough words, than can do justice to his edgy power.&quot;Training Day&quot; leaves the thinking viewer utterly exhausted and left in some kind of daze, grateful only that they do not live in the netherworld shown herein. Look at Ethan's face when he rides the bus after escaping, through pure luck and coincidence, death at the hands of the gangbangers. He is beaten. His actions afterwards are about redemption, a decision to take his life in a new direction in which expediency and innocence are no longer options. He has been transformed into a reluctant avenging angel, forced to face evil and fear because he cannot turn back. It is the story of Original Sin. Ethan represents what the viewer does not have the gumption to be at this point. The viewer wants only to crawl in a hole and forget what (s)he has seen, but Ethan's character is about the confrontation of good vs. evil that must take place if humanity hopes to advance.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;...",5,GROUNDBREAKING RACIAL BARRIERS ARE SCALED,1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,4529,"['Back', 'quot', 'go', 'go', 'quot', '1980s', 'heady', 'era', 'Wall', 'Street', 'quot', 'greed', 'quot', 'read', 'article', 'black', 'stock', 'broker', 'indicted', 'SEC', 'insider', 'trading', 'struck', 'odd', 'way', 'was', 'indicative', 'progress', 'African-Americans', 'had', 'have', 'access', 'inside', 'order', 'be', 'indicted', 'old', 'days', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'doors', 'opened', 'first', 'place.Which', 'quot', 'Training', 'Day', 'quot', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'performance', 'totally', 'corrupt', 'evil', 'L.A.', 'cop', 'fact', 'African-American', 'leading', 'man', 'portrayed', 'quot', 'bad', 'guy', 'quot', 'truly', 'groundbreaking', 'just', 'reason', 'look', 'film', 'be', 'awe', 'same', 'strange', 'twist', 'stock', 'broker', 'here', 'see', 'black', 'cop', 'who', 'doors', 'sin', 'open', 'white', 'cops', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'South', 'corruption', 'way', 'skin', 'color', 'story', 'humanity', 'temptation', 'power.Blacks', 'film', 'have', 'number', 'years', 'now', 'been', 'shown', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'shortage', 'depictions', 'black', 'drug', 'dealers', 'gangbangers', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'then', 'make', 'up', 'portraying', 'blacks', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'voices', 'conscience', 'reason', 'most', 'frequent', 'stereotype', 'quot', 'tough', 'fair', 'police', 'commander.', 'quot', 'negative', 'portrayals', 'blacks', 'however', 'were', 'never', 'played', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'Washington', 'built', 'career', 'guy', 'more', 'less', 'saving', 'world', 'quot', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'quot', 'quot', 'Fallen', 'quot', 'flaws', 'quot', 'Ricochet', 'quot', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'only', 'vindictive', 'white', 'man', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'quot', 'Training', 'Day', 'quot', 'Denzel', 'charismatic', 'own', 'product', 'world', 'convinced', 'revolves', 'choosing', 'pursue', 'amazing', 'role', 'Denzel', 'kind', 'courage', 'rare', 'actors.Think', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'instance', 'Redford', 'never', 'let', 'hair', 'down', 'played', 'heroes', 'fantasy', 'figures', 'Every', 'so', 'often', 'however', 'superstar', 'will', 'break', 'type', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'did', 'quot', 'Hud', 'quot', 'So', 'did', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'quot', 'Great', 'Santini', 'quot', '.What', 'even', 'more', 'astonishing', 'quot', 'Training', 'Day', 'quot', 'not', 'just', 'black', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'white', 'guy', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'clearly', 'marked', 'unfettered', 'hero', 'placed', 'utter', 'contrast', 'opposition', 'villain', 'quot', 'Candy', 'Man', 'quot', 'B', 'movie', 'franchise', 'early', '1990s', 'featured', 'politically', 'explosive', 'portrayal', 'black', 'man', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'way', 'white', 'women', 'was', 'hardly', 'big', 'time', 'fare.', 'quot', 'Training', 'Day', 'quot', 'Political', 'Correctness', 'past', '20', 'years', 'Hawke', 'not', 'only', 'innocent', 'good', 'contrast', 'Denzel', 'Lancelot-type', 'figure', 'who', 'aid', 'Latino-girl-in-distress', 'later', 'torture', 'terror', 'hands', 'group', 'Mexican', 'gangbangers', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'guys', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'terrifying', 'met', 'streets', 'even', 'knowing', 'were', 'just', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'frightened.By', 'means', 'quot', 'Training', 'Day', 'quot', 'leave', 'viewer', 'groping', 'uncomfortable', 'notion', 'quot', 'white', 'right.', 'quot', 'performances', 'are', 'too', 'real', 'too', 'powerful', 'only', 'retrospect', 'one', 'truly', 'groundbreaking', 'stuff', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'film', 'very', 'best', 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'superlatives', 'not', 'enough', 'words', 'can', 'do', 'justice', 'edgy', 'power.', 'quot', 'Training', 'Day', 'quot', 'thinking', 'viewer', 'utterly', 'exhausted', 'left', 'kind', 'daze', 'grateful', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'netherworld', 'shown', 'herein', 'Look', 'Ethan', 'face', 'when', 'bus', 'escaping', 'pure', 'luck', 'coincidence', 'death', 'hands', 'gangbangers', 'beaten', 'actions', 'afterwards', 'are', 'redemption', 'decision', 'take', 'life', 'new', 'direction', 'expediency', 'innocence', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'options', 'been', 'transformed', 'reluctant', 'avenging', 'angel', 'forced', 'face', 'evil', 'fear', 'can', 'not', 'turn', 'back', 'story', 'Original', 'Sin', 'Ethan', 'what', 'viewer', 'not', 'have', 'gumption', 'be', 'point', 'viewer', 'only', 'crawl', 'hole', 'forget', 'what', 's', 'seen', 'Ethan', 'character', 'confrontation', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'must', 'take', 'place', 'humanity', 'advance.STEVEN', 'TRAVERSAUTHOR', 'OF', 'quot', 'BARRY', 'BONDS', 'BASEBALL', 'SUPERMAN', 'quot']",N/A

586484,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JKEC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 2]","""Training Day"" marks another great performance by Denzel Washington, easily one of the most consistent actors working in Hollywood. Reviewing his career for a moment, there are many, many outstanding performances. Everything from Easy Rawlins in ""Devil In A Blue Dress"" to ""The Hurricane, ""Malcolm X' to ""Philadelphia"".Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is joining the Narcotics Force of the LAPD. The unit's leader is Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Alonzo gives Jake one day to prove himself worthy of a position on Alonzo's team. Jake is anxious to make Detective and Alonzo promises that after working with him for 18 months, he will become a detective. The day doesn't start well for Jake as Alonzo immediately sets the tone for the whole day and their relationship, defining who is in charge. As the training progresses, Alonzo shows Jake the routine he has set-up and the host of activities he is involved in. Alonzo doesn't walk the straight and narrow and Jake frequently has to come to terms with his own ethics and morals. Jake and Alonzo meet with drug dealers, Alonzo's El Salvadoran mistress, gang members and more, illustrating the fine balance that a detective has to walk. However, the balance has shifted as Alonzo demonstrates to everyone around him who is in charge.""Training Day"" written by David Ayer, and directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a powerful film. The film presents an unflinching portrait of life in the LAPD for two cops who are out of the normal routine. I think this is largely the point that Alonzo is trying to get across to Jake. They are not a part of the normal police force and should be allowed to take certain licenses. The conflict arises as Jake holds true to his ethics and morals.Denzel Washington walks a fine line with his portrayal. Alonzo Harris is an unlikable, powerful force unto himself, but he has to be likable, to a certain degree. Washington manages to pull this off by revealing a certain amount of laid back attitude. He jokes with Jake and manages to help alleviate the pressure, at times. Flipping the coin, he also keeps Jake on his feet by immediately creating an air of hostility and uncomfort by bringing him back into Alonzo's reality. The story also sets up a conflict between Alonzo and another group, providing an ongoing level of hostility. As the day progresses, Alonzo becomes more desperate and unhinged as he has to deal with the impending deadline. A very, very good performance by Denzel Washington.Ethan Hawke is also very good. Primarily the straight man to Washington's comic, Hawke reacts to most everything that Washington does. He brings a sense of naivete and innocence to the role balancing that with his previous work as a cop and the fact that he is an adult. It is a good performance that reveals a lot more depth than a superficial `buddy'. As Alonzo continues to throw things at Jake, we see Hawke constantly working through the problems and the situations, quickly, before he makes decisions.As the film depicts two cops working in a rough and violent terrain, the film contains a few scenes of concentrated violence. Their language is also very coarse. As both are used to tell the story, these elements don't bother me, but you should be aware that they are present.Overall, ""Training Day"" is a very good film, but the conclusion is not as effective as the rest of the film. In a final showdown, Alonzo is confronted with many of the people he previously battled, a sort of showdown. The most obvious person to end the situation walks away leaving Alonzo to confront a group of gang members. The gang members pose a credible threat, with guns at their sides. Who exactly are we supposed to root for in this confrontation? Harris is crooked and dirty, the gang members aren't little angels of virtue either. In a way, this conclusion would present an ironic twist to one of Alonzo's previous statements about the street taking care of the street, but that doesn't happen either. Instead, we have what seems to be a tacked on ending, neatly tying everything up. Personally, I would've preferred an ending that didn't necessarily tie everything up. The cops don't have everything tied up at the end of the day, why should the film?""Training Day"" is a very good, very adult entertainment, featuring another great performance by Denzel Washington.",4,"Washington's ""Training Day""",1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,4324,"['Training', 'Day', 'great', 'performance', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'consistent', 'actors', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'Reviewing', 'career', 'moment', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Everything', 'Easy', 'Rawlins', 'Devil', 'A', 'Blue', 'Dress', 'Hurricane', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Philadelphia', '.Jake', 'Hoyt', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'joining', 'Narcotics', 'Force', 'LAPD', 'unit', 'leader', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Alonzo', 'Jake', 'one', 'day', 'prove', 'worthy', 'position', 'Alonzo', 'team', 'Jake', 'anxious', 'make', 'Detective', 'Alonzo', 'working', '18', 'months', 'will', 'become', 'detective', 'day', ""n't"", 'start', 'well', 'Jake', 'Alonzo', 'immediately', 'tone', 'whole', 'day', 'relationship', 'defining', 'who', 'charge', 'training', 'Alonzo', 'Jake', 'routine', 'set-up', 'host', 'activities', 'involved', 'Alonzo', ""n't"", 'walk', 'straight', 'narrow', 'Jake', 'frequently', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'ethics', 'morals', 'Jake', 'Alonzo', 'meet', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Alonzo', 'El', 'Salvadoran', 'mistress', 'gang', 'members', 'more', 'illustrating', 'fine', 'balance', 'detective', 'walk', 'However', 'balance', 'shifted', 'Alonzo', 'everyone', 'who', 'charge', 'Training', 'Day', 'written', 'David', 'Ayer', 'directed', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'powerful', 'film', 'film', 'unflinching', 'portrait', 'life', 'LAPD', 'two', 'cops', 'who', 'are', 'normal', 'routine', 'think', 'largely', 'point', 'Alonzo', 'trying', 'get', 'Jake', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'normal', 'police', 'force', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'take', 'certain', 'licenses', 'conflict', 'Jake', 'true', 'ethics', 'morals.Denzel', 'Washington', 'fine', 'line', 'portrayal', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'unlikable', 'powerful', 'force', 'unto', 'be', 'likable', 'certain', 'degree', 'Washington', 'pull', 'off', 'revealing', 'certain', 'amount', 'laid', 'back', 'attitude', 'Jake', 'help', 'alleviate', 'pressure', 'times', 'Flipping', 'coin', 'also', 'Jake', 'feet', 'immediately', 'creating', 'air', 'hostility', 'uncomfort', 'bringing', 'back', 'Alonzo', 'reality', 'story', 'also', 'up', 'conflict', 'Alonzo', 'group', 'providing', 'ongoing', 'level', 'hostility', 'day', 'Alonzo', 'more', 'desperate', 'unhinged', 'deal', 'impending', 'deadline', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Denzel', 'Washington.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Primarily', 'straight', 'man', 'Washington', 'comic', 'Hawke', 'most', 'everything', 'Washington', 'sense', 'naivete', 'innocence', 'role', 'balancing', 'previous', 'work', 'cop', 'fact', 'adult', 'good', 'performance', 'lot', 'more', 'depth', 'superficial', 'buddy', 'Alonzo', 'throw', 'things', 'Jake', 'see', 'Hawke', 'constantly', 'working', 'problems', 'situations', 'quickly', 'decisions.As', 'film', 'two', 'cops', 'working', 'rough', 'violent', 'terrain', 'film', 'few', 'scenes', 'concentrated', 'violence', 'language', 'also', 'very', 'coarse', 'are', 'used', 'tell', 'story', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'are', 'present.Overall', 'Training', 'Day', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'conclusion', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'rest', 'film', 'final', 'showdown', 'Alonzo', 'confronted', 'many', 'people', 'previously', 'battled', 'sort', 'showdown', 'most', 'obvious', 'person', 'end', 'situation', 'away', 'leaving', 'Alonzo', 'confront', 'group', 'gang', 'members', 'gang', 'members', 'pose', 'credible', 'threat', 'guns', 'sides', 'Who', 'exactly', 'are', 'supposed', 'root', 'confrontation', 'Harris', 'crooked', 'dirty', 'gang', 'members', 'are', ""n't"", 'little', 'angels', 'virtue', 'way', 'conclusion', 'would', 'present', 'ironic', 'twist', 'one', 'Alonzo', 'previous', 'statements', 'street', 'taking', 'care', 'street', ""n't"", 'happen', 'either', 'Instead', 'have', 'what', 'be', 'tacked', 'ending', 'neatly', 'tying', 'everything', 'up', 'Personally', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'tie', 'everything', 'up', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'tied', 'up', 'end', 'day', 'why', 'should', 'film', 'Training', 'Day', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'featuring', 'great', 'performance', 'Denzel', 'Washington']",N/A

You get deleted scenes , dir. commentary, music videos , and an alternate ending. Most times the ""alternate ending "" , added to newer dvd's, motivate me to buy it. Although, 9 times out of 10, you get an instant idea of why it was deleted ,in the first place. However, just to have that viewing option , it's worth the investment. Anyway, the film's actors deliver phenominal performances and catipult a simple script ,into a film that not only ,studies the motivations and psychology of people dealing with the corruption and life on the streets, but entertain and shock the viewers. As you should already know, Denzel Washington took home an Academy Award after his portrayal of a corrupt undercover police officer,in this production. Ethan Hawk, also works through his role as a rookie cop , with excellent believability and intensity. Although , this film has valuable lessons to learn , I don't recommend that you view this with the little ones. It contains scenes of drug use , very foul language, and graphic violence. Despite those aspects , Training Day offers a rare glimpse into the harsh realities of crime and deseption. Definately a dvd to buy. Even if you're not into the bad cop /good cop movies, seeing Denzel play a charcter that's as evil as his best good guy roles were , in the past, makes it worth your while. Alot of people I know were shocked that he could play bad, so good. But if they'd noticed , he gave a fantastic sinister performance as the younger juvenile Malcom X , in the Spike Lee movie.

At first this seems strange but as the plot progresses it becomes evident Alonzo has Hoyt trapped.  The plot is superb, though the ending is a little predictable, not wanting to give it away though.

This movie works. Even if the plot line seems like a big wallop of a cliche. I'll put it this way... If you have to see just one of ''those movies'', this is probably the best one you'll ever see. I stayed up all night to watch this on HBO when I was already up later than I should've been, even though I knew I had to go to work the next day. It is one of those kind of movies. I just kept wondering whether Washington's character was going to be redeemable or end up still questionable or what?!

While many viewers and critics seem genuinely shocked at his transformation into an absolute monster, I kept thinking: didn't anyone else see the first half of &quot;Malcolm X&quot;? A decade ago, Washington bared his fangs to fine, frightening effect, in the first hour or so, of Spike Lee's epic, and while he later made the transition to good guy(and still paid with his life) the fury, violence, attitude and animalistic behavior was still there early on. &quot;Training Day&quot; is a brilliant, simple but effective film about the underbelly of law-enforcement and one young cop's refusal to comprimise his values, even at gunpoint. Ethan Hawke is terrific as Jake Hoyt and injects just the right amount of innocence, disbelief and decency into what could have been a one-note character, his Oscar nod was well deserved. Denzel won for a reason! He is having the time of his life being a bad**s in this film and it shows, this is scenery chewing of the highest order! His Alonzo Harris is the best crooked cop I've ever seen and Washington delivers every line as with lip-smacking relish, you simply can't take your eyes off of him.&quot;Training Day&quot; is first rate urban entertainment that gets better with every viewing.

Denzel Washington plays veteran Alonzo Harris whose methods seem questionable, to say the least. Harris argues that one has to become a wolf to take down a wolf. Will Hoyt make it through the day alive, let alone uncorrupted?&#34;Training Day&#34; had a lukewarm reception at the box office the first weekend of its release in 2001, but the profits steadily increased for the next six week as word-of-mouth spread. The greatness of &#34;Training Day&#34; is not simply due to the intriguing story and excellent writing, but also the superb casting. Hawke is perfect as the naive, but ambitious rookie and Washington is nothing short of stunning as Alonzo Harris, the latter ranking with the best performances in cinematic history, like Jon Voight's Manny in &#34;Runaway Train&#34; or Robert Duvall's Col. Kilgore in &#34;Apocalypse Now,&#34; etc., etc.As the training day continues Alonzo's methodology becomes increasingly dubious and you can just imagine Hoyt responding, &#34;I... don't... see... any... method... at... all... Sir.&#34; How can anyone withstand the temptations he faces and not give in (and I don't mean the drugs)? Needless to say, the film scores high marks on the moral conundrum front.There's one obviously contrived element but that's par for the course with movies and it could've been worse. Of course, the action and thrills are amped-up, but the tone is thankfully realistic.Additional actors include Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Eva Mendes, Charlotte Ayanna, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.The film was shot in L.A. and runs 122 minutes.FINAL WORD: &#34;Training Day&#34; is an excellent urban thriller with an ultra-captivating performance by Washington.
