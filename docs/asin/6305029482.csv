That said, this is a nice little production. The scenery is beautiful, the costumes are great, the music is lovely and appropriate, the acting is solid.The plot involves the lovely Bathsheba who is the object of affection (obsession?) for three very different men. Paloma Baeza is Bathsheba, she is a good actress but I found her extremely youthful face a bit distressing at times. She just looked too young to be such a tease. Still, she plays her role well.The three men in her life are the stalwart shepherd Gabriel, the obsessive older farmer Boldwood and the dashing, heartbreaking Sgt. Troy. Nathaniel Parker (very good in Vanity Fair as Becky's clueless husband) plays Gabriel with perhaps more passion than he displayed in the book but he looks the part and anyone who has not read the book would never know the difference. He fits right in and looks quite handsome in the bargain.Jonathan Firth (Fred in Middlemarch. Brother to Colin Firth of Pride and Prejudice) plays the thankless role of Troy with great relish. (Troy is not a cool villain, he is the sort you boo and hiss at whenever he is on screen, it takes a good actor to carry him off without seeming too Snideley Whiplash about it) He is the only man of the three who excites Bathsheba and he is the only one who is not truly in love with her.The supporting cast is good, especially Natasha Little (Becky in Vanity Fair) as Troy's cast-off mistress Fanny.In conclusion, I liked the 60s version a hair better but only a hair and I highly reccomend anyone interested in this story to try both versions as both are good in their own unique way. This version is more accurate with costumes and such but the 6os one is more suitable for family viewing.Scenes I liked better in this version:Gabriel looks for a jobGabriel and Bathsheba's first argumentTroy's sword exercisesFanny visits Troy at the barracks window",3,Nice Masterpiece Theater Production,1008288000,"12 14, 2001",2001,1996,"['should', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'love', 'book', 'have', 'seen', '60s', 'version', 'story', 'rather', 'liked', 'said', 'nice', 'little', 'production', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'are', 'great', 'music', 'lovely', 'appropriate', 'acting', 'solid.The', 'plot', 'lovely', 'Bathsheba', 'who', 'object', 'affection', 'obsession', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'Paloma', 'Baeza', 'Bathsheba', 'good', 'actress', 'found', 'extremely', 'youthful', 'face', 'bit', 'distressing', 'times', 'just', 'looked', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'such', 'tease', 'Still', 'role', 'well.The', 'three', 'men', 'life', 'are', 'stalwart', 'shepherd', 'Gabriel', 'obsessive', 'older', 'farmer', 'Boldwood', 'dashing', 'heartbreaking', 'Sgt', 'Troy', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'very', 'good', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'Becky', 'clueless', 'husband', 'Gabriel', 'perhaps', 'more', 'passion', 'displayed', 'book', 'part', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'difference', 'right', 'quite', 'handsome', 'bargain.Jonathan', 'Firth', 'Fred', 'Middlemarch', 'Brother', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'thankless', 'role', 'Troy', 'great', 'relish', 'Troy', 'not', 'cool', 'villain', 'sort', 'boo', 'hiss', 'whenever', 'screen', 'good', 'actor', 'carry', 'off', 'seeming', 'too', 'Snideley', 'Whiplash', 'only', 'man', 'three', 'who', 'Bathsheba', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'truly', 'love', 'her.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'especially', 'Natasha', 'Little', 'Becky', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'Troy', 'cast-off', 'mistress', 'Fanny.In', 'conclusion', 'liked', '60s', 'version', 'hair', 'better', 'only', 'hair', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'story', 'try', 'versions', 'are', 'good', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'version', 'more', 'accurate', 'costumes', 'such', '6os', 'one', 'more', 'suitable', 'family', 'viewing.Scenes', 'liked', 'better', 'version', 'Gabriel', 'jobGabriel', 'Bathsheba', 'first', 'argumentTroy', 'sword', 'visits', 'Troy', 'barracks', 'window']",Far From the Madding Crowd VHS

but we are pleased to report that as a free-standing work in its own right, this is a very compelling film for the small screen.The production values are first-class, and the portrayal of early-Industrial England (c. 1840) is superb--this at a time of `merrie olde Eyngland' before the Victorian `Respectable' social-system came into full play: this was the time of blood-sports when they oft had the honeymoon before the wedding.Those who well knowHolst's Somerset Rhapsodywill recognize the use of the folksong `Blow Away the Morning Dew' used throughout.[W]hy unblooms the best hope ever sown?--Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain,And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan...--Thomas Hardy (1898), a sonnet, `Hap'~~~",5,Hardy's Horrible Hap...,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,2783,"['~~~Hardy', 'Horrible', 'Hap', 'thePower', 'Feminine', 'Principle', 'Decades', 'when', 'public', 'education', 'promoted', 'classics', 'building-blocks', 'towards', 'culture', 'facility', 'freely', 'independent', 'speculative', 'cognition', 'were', 'forced', 'read', 'Hardy', 'novels.We', 'never', 'liked', ""'ve"", 'never', 'returned', 'them.His', 'prose', 'turgid', 'subtle', 'critique', 'banality', 'finitude', 'human', 'nature', 'mildly', 'nauseating', 'true', 'reality.The', 'ironic', 'thing', 'Hardy', 'was', 'so', 'shrewd', 'accurate', 'critique', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'mostly', 'unpredictable', 'irrational', 'foolish', 'agree', 'withMaughamwho', 'said', 'never', 'ceased', 'surprise', 'how', 'people', 'awkward', 'occupants', 'world', 'hostile', 'nature', 'so', 'brief', 'time', 'should', 'so', 'perversely', 'willfully', 'cause', 'unnecessary', 'unhappiness.The', 'exact', 'quote', 'strange', 'men', 'inhabitants', 'so', 'short', 'while', 'alien', 'inhuman', 'world', 'should', 'go', 'way', 'cause', 'so', 'much', 'unhappiness', ""'The"", 'Alien', 'Corn', 'Hardy', 'was', 'controversial', 'novelist', 'turn', 'century', 'mid-century', 'Victorian', 'naturalism', 'was', 'less', 'blatant', 'say', ""Dreiser'sgraphicobviousness"", 'far', 'prefer', 'as', 'well', 'stilted', 'butimminently', 'effectiveEnglish', 'prose', '.So', 'Hardy', 'was', 'acceptable', 'prudish-conservative', 'high', 'school', 'classroom', '1950s', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'Jude', 'Obscure', 'Tess', ""D'Ubervilles"", 'stories', 'mid-19th', 'C', 'English', 'west-country', 'Dorset', 'Wiltshire', 'Somerset', 'society', 'were', 'positively', 'forced', 'never', 'did', 'read', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'Interestingly', 'Hardy', 'now', 'recognized', 'important', 'Anglophone', 'poet', 'cf.The', 'Norton', 'Anthology', 'Modern', 'Poetry.Also', 'Hardy', 'personal', 'existence', 'art', 'were', 'so', 'interesting', 'contemporaries', 'relationship', 'Emma', 'Lavinia', 'Gifford', 'was', 'fictionalized', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'inCakes', 'Ale', 'case', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'accurate', 'quite', 'excellent', 'transposition', 'TV', 'drama', 'original', 'text', 'are', 'pleased', 'report', 'free-standing', 'work', 'own', 'right', 'very', 'compelling', 'film', 'small', 'screen.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'first-class', 'portrayal', 'early-Industrial', 'England', 'c.', '1840', 'superb', 'time', 'merrie', 'olde', 'Eyngland', 'Victorian', 'Respectable', 'social-system', 'came', 'full', 'play', 'was', 'time', 'blood-sports', 'when', 'oft', 'had', 'honeymoon', 'wedding.Those', 'who', 'well', 'knowHolst', 'Somerset', 'Rhapsodywill', 'recognize', 'use', 'folksong', 'Blow', 'Away', 'Morning', 'Dew', 'used', '[', 'W', ']', 'hy', 'best', 'hope', 'ever', 'sown', 'Crass', 'Casualty', 'sun', 'rain', 'dicing', 'Time', 'gladness', 'moan', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', '1898', 'sonnet', ""Hap'~~~""]",Far From the Madding Crowd VHS

This is closer to the novel but leaves out a few words from the text that could have been included in the screenplay in my opinion.""Vanity"" says Oak to the gatekeeper on the toll road after Bathsheba passes by on her way to visit her aunt.  This early part of the book is barely covered in the movie and is so needed for understanding.It is her vanity that almost destroys her but causes terrible things to happen to others.  She cares so much for herself and so little for others and all the while tries to make matters look the opposite.  The film is subtle about her vanity while the book is not.  Her vanity meets the man of similiar vanity and she marrys him.  She soon learns her tragic mistake but is not much able to see it is her own fault.But most of the others in the story can see it.  Over time they lose respect for her and some start to leave her farm.  Shepherd Oak is the only one who saves her farm many  times but grows weary of her selfish vanity eventually.  His life was saved by her when she lived with her aunt.  He believes he should help her in return.  The book makes more of this friendship.  Oak can not save her from herself.Of course, the ending is nicely done and pleasing.The music, acting, camera work, and local scenery of farming are done ever so well.  I really like this movie.  My wish for better is due to my fondness for the novel, of course, as it has a complex plot and marvelous characters.

444607,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,6305029482,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 5]","When I was a child, the beautiful Julie Christie played Bathsheba Everdale in the 1967 film version of John Schlesinger's ""Far from the Madding Crowd.""  Ms Christie embodied a loveliness that is most representative of the mod Carnaby Street `bird' also epitomized by other long-tressed blondes like Pattie Boyd, Jane Asher, and Chrissie Shrimpton.  As the spectacular Bathsheba, understandably, Ms. Christie chooses at whim whichever man she desires--will it be the faithful Alan Bates, the dashing Trevor Howard or the wealthy mature Peter Finch?In director Nicholas Renton's version of Hardy's classic tale, Bathsheba, played by Paloma Baeza, rules her country manor in a far less obvious way.  Ms Baeza's beauty when compared with Christie's does not entice with groomed perfection.  However, with her bold angel's face framed with a mass of unruly dark hair that she gathers in a quick bun or pulls back to suggest the haste of a working member of a busy farm, Baeza much more than Christie steps out of the pages of Hardy's novel with more authenticity.  Hardy's Bathsheba matter-of-factly marvels at the perfection of her face; there is little artifice--just knowledge of its existence and perhaps its ability to facilitate her ambition.  Baeza's skill in portraying these traits subtly speaks well of her ability as an actress.  Her eyes tell all; they well up with pent-up Victorian emotion even when the muscles in her face do not even move a millimeter.  Nonetheless, she may seem a bit reserved for the irrepressible Bathsheba.Despite the tumultuous plot line, this version of ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" pleasantly drones like bees on a summer day.  The simple life of running a farm with its multitude of manual labors and laborers as suggested by the title, of course is debunked by the wild emotions and desires that run rampant below the surface of what seems to be a well-organized country manor. Each of the players, although they live in paradise, wildly seeks distraction, through love, the need for possession and the usual gossipy curiosity found in any close-knit environment where new faces instill a fresh surge in the pulse of the small community's lifeblood.Most notable is the performance of Nathaniel Parker as Gabriel Oak--this handsome actor personifies the stalwartly farmer in all his varying moods--a far different role from his overtly sensual one inWide Sargasso Sea.  His love for Bathsheba shines like a beacon in the dark; his loyalty throbs steadily with a stubbornness at once chivalrous and proud.  He wears his honor like a badge and righteously displays his disapproval for Bathsheba's behavior.  Outwardly sensual in his resplendent yet subtle manliness, Parker's perspective frames the drama from beginning to end with a marvelous quietude that proves that still water does run deep.The other two suitors of Bathsheba are admirably played by Nigel Terry as the besotted neighboring landowner, Mr. Boldwood, and Justin Firth, recognizable as the younger brother of Colin in the role as Sgt. Troy.  Renton's direction enables the audience to see Bathsheba from the perspective of the desires of both these male characters and to understand their motivations completely with respect to the sensibilities and expectations of the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.Bottom Line?  This BBC presentation of ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" faithfully depicts the situations and characterizations in Thomas Hardy's novel of the same name.  Beautiful to look at with lush countryside, authentic period costume and players that effectively portray the characters, this 203 minute presentation will entertain anyone who enjoys a Masterpiece Theater adaptation of classic literature.  Lead Paloma Baeza's Bathsheba adequately shows the vanity and expectation of her character with nuanced looks and smug reality befitting the farming community setting.

444608,A3PTOYW3XDY0ID,6305029482,feedthecat,"[92, 98]","This 1998 Granada TV-WGBH co-production of Thomas Hardy's 1874 novel of the same name - which was his first great literary success - is arguably the best tv adaptation of any of his works, in part becuz it runs for 200-odd minutes (not the 240 cited above), which allowed the production team to unfold the story in an ""unhurried"" fashion.  The plot revolves around a woman, wealthy farmowner  Bathsheba Everdene (portrayed by Paloma Baeza, who, though she looks much more southern European than English, is brilliant in the role), and her relations with three suitors, Shepherd  Oak (Nathaniel Parker), Sergeant Troy (Jonathan Firth), and Mr. Boldwood (Nigel Terry).  Interestingly, btw, despite her unsual position for that era as an independent woman of wealth, each of the aforementioned men is  drawn to Bathsheba for herself rather than for her money.The adaptation is more or less faithful to the novel, which was set in the 1840s,  and both are favourites among Hardy fans largely becuz FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD is the least tragic of the Victorian writer's great ""Novels of Character"" (indeed, compared to THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE, TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES, & JUDE THE OBSCURE, FFTMC is a positively happy tale).  Another thing of note both in the novel and this TV movie is the way the farming scenes and the language, manners, and customs of the country folk are wonderfully presented, making the story as a whole seem true(r) to life.  And, as this is a Hardy story, there will be some incidents that may seem improbable, but the characters themselves are very believable - and very human.Yet, while this is my fav Hardy adaptation and one of my fav Hardy novels, I still have to agree with the opinion of his great contemporary Henry James that, ""(the suitor who winds up finally winning Bathsheba's hand) is too good for her"".  Watch this excellent production to see whether or not you agree.

I will just say that I agree with the high marks most have given this adaptation of Far From the Madding Crowd.  I recommend it.  I'm writing this to add a few of my own thoughts.First, I've read the book and seen the Julie Christie / Terence Stamp movie.  I was a little wary of watching this version, thinking that it couldn't live up to the previous movie--it did.  In particular, I didn't know if anybody could play Sgt. Troy as well as Terence Stamp, but Jonathan Firth made the part his own.  I've seen him in at least three projects now, and I think he deserves so much more than being known as Colin Firth's brother.I must admit I had a little trouble with some of the country accents.  I watch a lot of British movies and TV shows, and generally have no problem at all with accents, but some of these country accents of the farm workers and country folk were a little tough.  I didn't get every word, but I got enough.The attention to detail was wonderful.  Watching the farm workers engaged in their various agricultural pursuits using antique machinery and old methods was fascinating.  The casting of the farm workers and household staff was perfect.  It is hard to believe these were modern day actors, not genuine country folks.I suspect that Hardy would prefer this version, as it is closer to the book than the previous version.",4,Faithful to the book,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,1422,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'rewrite', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'very', 'well', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'agree', 'high', 'marks', 'most', 'have', 'given', 'adaptation', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'recommend', ""'m"", 'writing', 'add', 'few', 'own', 'thoughts.First', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'Julie', 'Christie', '/', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'wary', 'watching', 'version', 'thinking', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'previous', 'movie', 'did', 'particular', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anybody', 'could', 'play', 'Sgt', 'Troy', 'as', 'well', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Jonathan', 'Firth', 'made', 'part', 'own', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'three', 'projects', 'now', 'think', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'being', 'known', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'brother.I', 'must', 'admit', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'country', 'accents', 'watch', 'lot', 'British', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'generally', 'have', 'problem', 'accents', 'country', 'accents', 'farm', 'workers', 'country', 'folk', 'were', 'little', 'tough', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'word', 'got', 'enough.The', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Watching', 'farm', 'workers', 'engaged', 'various', 'agricultural', 'pursuits', 'using', 'antique', 'machinery', 'old', 'methods', 'was', 'fascinating', 'casting', 'farm', 'workers', 'household', 'staff', 'was', 'perfect', 'hard', 'believe', 'were', 'modern', 'day', 'actors', 'not', 'genuine', 'country', 'folks.I', 'suspect', 'Hardy', 'would', 'prefer', 'version', 'closer', 'book', 'previous', 'version']",Far From the Madding Crowd VHS

444618,A3F1RS18J88FD5,6305029482,M. Morris,"[7, 9]","I watched this version of Far from the Madding Crowd in two segments. Part One was fairly well scripted. Any changes (such as Fanny deliberately running away from Frank) were minor and made sense. Even better, the relationship between Bathsheba and Gabriel was developed. However, well before the first tape was finished, I was waiting for it to end. The makers seemed to feel obligated to keep in every single incident in the book. In a novel, this isn't a problem, for you can just set down a book and come back to it when you're ready. With a movie, this is much harder. Filmmakers MUST realize they can make cuts in and shape a script!Part Two was much worse. Without fixing the length problem of Part One, it almost seemed as if they fired the intelligent scriptwriter and hired one who didn't know what they were doing. Bathsheba appears to love Gabriel, not Frank, so why does she choose Frank over Gabriel after Gabriel has made a declaration of love? Why couldn't have Fanny just died on the spot when Frank finds her again and she confesses why she left him? What was the point of keeping her alive any longer? Not to mention having Frank yell at Bathsheba for no reason... The point, it seemed, was to have a sensational coffin scene with Fanny and a naked baby - and Bathsheba, as no proper Victorian woman would have done, asks Frank outright if he is the father. (The 1967 Far from the Madding Crowd gave Fanny a blue baby that looked like it was made out of papier-mache in the coffin scene - WHY must there always be sensationalism added to these old stories?) Also, in the novel, Frank never talks about firing Gabriel. He did in an original draft of the novel, but if Thomas Hardy could omit that, why couldn't the filmmakers?Also, what on earth was the point of adding in all kinds of crude content in this version? This adaptation has two servants in suggestive positions in the barn, Frank attempts to seduce Bathsheba before their marriage, and the couple is later shown naked in bed (though their privates are covered). Such added content is appropriate in a story like Tess of the D'Urbervilles or Jude the Obscure, but why on earth should it be included in Far from the Madding Crowd? The '60s version was much more appropriate.Finally, although the acting was good in this version (Mr. Boldwood behaved much more like a madman, and Gabriel is in it much more), I missed the charisma and star power of the actors in the 1967 film. Plus, Bathsheba, although fairly attractive, wasn't nearly beautiful enough. So this production was overlong, unengaging, had unnecessary bedroom content, and a confusing and convoluted second half. Stick with the '60s version. It has its faults, major and minor, but it's a much more enjoyable watch.",2,"Good Part One, Bad Part Two, Overlong",1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,2757,"['watched', 'version', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'two', 'segments', 'Part', 'One', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'scripted', 'changes', 'such', 'Fanny', 'deliberately', 'running', 'away', 'Frank', 'were', 'minor', 'made', 'sense', 'Even', 'better', 'relationship', 'Bathsheba', 'Gabriel', 'was', 'developed', 'However', 'well', 'first', 'tape', 'was', 'finished', 'was', 'waiting', 'end', 'makers', 'seemed', 'feel', 'obligated', 'keep', 'single', 'incident', 'book', 'novel', ""n't"", 'problem', 'can', 'just', 'set', 'down', 'book', 'come', 'back', 'when', ""'re"", 'ready', 'movie', 'much', 'harder', 'Filmmakers', 'MUST', 'realize', 'can', 'make', 'cuts', 'shape', 'script', 'Part', 'Two', 'was', 'much', 'worse', 'fixing', 'length', 'problem', 'Part', 'One', 'almost', 'seemed', 'fired', 'intelligent', 'scriptwriter', 'hired', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'Bathsheba', 'love', 'Gabriel', 'not', 'Frank', 'so', 'why', 'choose', 'Frank', 'Gabriel', 'Gabriel', 'made', 'declaration', 'love', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'Fanny', 'just', 'died', 'spot', 'when', 'Frank', 'again', 'why', 'left', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'keeping', 'alive', 'longer', 'Not', 'mention', 'having', 'Frank', 'yell', 'Bathsheba', 'reason', 'point', 'seemed', 'was', 'have', 'sensational', 'coffin', 'scene', 'Fanny', 'naked', 'baby', 'Bathsheba', 'proper', 'Victorian', 'woman', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Frank', 'outright', 'father', '1967', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'gave', 'Fanny', 'blue', 'baby', 'looked', 'was', 'made', 'papier-mache', 'coffin', 'scene', 'WHY', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'sensationalism', 'added', 'old', 'stories', 'Also', 'novel', 'Frank', 'never', 'firing', 'Gabriel', 'did', 'original', 'draft', 'novel', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'could', 'omit', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'filmmakers', 'Also', 'what', 'earth', 'was', 'point', 'adding', 'kinds', 'crude', 'content', 'version', 'adaptation', 'two', 'servants', 'suggestive', 'positions', 'barn', 'Frank', 'seduce', 'Bathsheba', 'marriage', 'couple', 'later', 'shown', 'naked', 'bed', 'privates', 'are', 'covered', 'Such', 'added', 'content', 'appropriate', 'story', 'Tess', ""D'Urbervilles"", 'Jude', 'Obscure', 'why', 'earth', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', ""'60s"", 'version', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate.Finally', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'version', 'Mr.', 'Boldwood', 'behaved', 'much', 'more', 'madman', 'Gabriel', 'much', 'more', 'missed', 'charisma', 'star', 'power', 'actors', '1967', 'film', 'Bathsheba', 'fairly', 'attractive', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'production', 'was', 'overlong', 'unengaging', 'had', 'unnecessary', 'bedroom', 'content', 'confusing', 'convoluted', 'second', 'half', 'Stick', ""'60s"", 'version', 'faults', 'major', 'minor', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",Far From the Madding Crowd VHS

Beautifully photographed, capturing the rustic glory of the Dorset countryside and a very earthy portrayal of the novel's characters, I am very surprised that it has never been released on region 1 DVD.  Surely there is enough acclaim and fans of this film to issue it in North America, especially now that John Schlesinger's epic of Thomas Hardy's novel was recently released in region 1 and it received a vast restoration of sound and scope compared to the region 2 print.I must give particular praise to Natasha Little's portrayal of the sweet and wronged Fanny Robin, cast aside by Jonathan Firth's rakish Sergant Troy for Paloma Baeza's Bathsheba Everdene.  You really feel for Fanny when she has been tricked into going to the wrong church on the morning that she and Troy were to be married.  The scenes of the girl's hardships while she is with child makes me wonder if that was some foreshadowing for Hardy's later creation of Tess Durbeyfield.  Baeza does a respectable turn as Bathsheba, and although she is very pretty I don't think she captured the striking beauty that Hardy's herione is described as possessing.  Still, she played the role well and she established wonderful chemistry with Nathaniel Parker's Gabriel Oak. Parker is excellent, capturing Oak's essence, but for some reason I found him too old for the part (although Alan Bates was surely around the same age when he portrayed the character, but then, Julie Christie was older than Baeza when she portrayed Bathsheba).  Nigel Terry as Boldwood more than matches Peter Finch's portrayal, while I don't find Firth as handsome as Terence Stamp, I feel Firth captured a bit more of Troy's rakishness and showed more dimension in the part. What I find frustrating about both film adaptations of FFTMC is that we never get to see Bathsheba and Oak kiss.You know all along that Gabriel is the right man for Bathsheba, so you expect some kind of payoff (them getting married notwithstanding), but I guess it may be better to imagine rather than to be shown.One thing I definately missed in this Masterpiece Theatre presentation is the wonderfully fitting music score that so defined the 1967 movie.  Not that the score for the 1998 FFTMC is not good, I just felt it was lacking something.  Oh well.  Either way this is still a memorable version of Hardy's novel and very much deserving of proper DVD distribution.

Like another reviewer posted, it was hard to get past the 1960 hairstyles and Hollywood drama of that film.  This version made in 1998 offers some good actors.  There is Paloma Baeza, who plays Bathsheba Everdene, a beautiful, proud, but fickle woman who inherits her uncle's farm.  Nathaniel Parker as Gabriel Oak, the man who loves her, is rebuffed and although he is a very capable shepherd and farmer, loses his livelihood.  Mr. Boldwood is played by Nigel Terry, and is the older neighbor, a life long bachelor who adores Bathsheba and is made a butt of a joke as she very coyly sends him a valentine.  Then there is the wayward soldier Frank Troy played by Jonathan Firth--a rogue indeed.There is much more detail in this movie as it explores more the backgrounds of both Bathsheba and Gabriel as they meet early on and Gabriel tries to unsuccessfully win her.  It shows Gabriel struggling to run a farm and raise a flock of sheep only to have it all go to ruin.  Bathsheba living with her aunt suddenly becomes the mistress of the farm.There is another character that becomes part of this story and it's Fanny Robin who is once the paramour of Frank Troy.  Their marriage doesn't take place due to a mix-up and Frank is so embarrassed that he just goes away.  What happens to Fanny is heartrendering.  The actress who plays her portrayed the simple, absent minded, innocent that she is.The cinematography was excellent, with the cliffs, ocean views, and the 19th century life on a farm.  And of course the harshness of the winters in that part of England.

This film is beautifully done with great performances, especially by Nathaniel Parker as the steadfast Gabriel Oak.

A note on the video quality:  I watched this first on a small HD TV, and it looked okay, but not great.  I then played it on a large Standard Definition TV, and it looked much better.
