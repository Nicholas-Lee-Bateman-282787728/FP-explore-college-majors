550303,A191NBP5GSENBL,B00004TJG5,"J. Armstrong ""jarm""","[13, 13]","Key The Metal Idol is perhaps, one of the greatest anime titles in history.  The story is about Key, a robotic girl who isn't all she appears as she tries to find 30,000 friends so they can turn her into a human girl.  Key is helped and hindered along the way by a variety of characters, all  who have their own vested interest in Key's success or failure.Key's  plot twists and turns with almost every episode, until the final moments  you are not quite sure where everything lies and it's story telling and  script is extremely impressive.Key's artwork is equally stunning, the  character of Key herself is beautifully crafted, movement and expressions  are drawn with a real charm.The music to the series is also spellbinding  from the Japanese Pop Music littered throughout to the enchanting and  bizarre background music, Key doesn't disappoint on the audio level any  less than it doesn't disappoint visually.I can't say too much about the  plot without ruining, just trust me and buy Key.",5,One of the best anime series in history,962323200,"06 30, 2000",2000,995,"['Key', 'Metal', 'Idol', 'perhaps', 'one', 'greatest', 'anime', 'titles', 'history', 'story', 'Key', 'robotic', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'find', '30,000', 'friends', 'can', 'turn', 'human', 'girl', 'Key', 'helped', 'hindered', 'way', 'variety', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'vested', 'interest', 'Key', 'success', 'failure.Key', 'plot', 'twists', 'almost', 'episode', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'everything', 'story', 'telling', 'script', 'extremely', 'impressive.Key', 'artwork', 'equally', 'stunning', 'character', 'Key', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'movement', 'expressions', 'are', 'drawn', 'real', 'charm.The', 'music', 'series', 'also', 'spellbinding', 'Japanese', 'Pop', 'Music', 'littered', 'enchanting', 'bizarre', 'background', 'music', 'Key', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'audio', 'level', 'less', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'visually.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'ruining', 'just', 'trust', 'buy', 'Key']",N/A

550305,A3LX9270E6DMCQ,B00004TJG5,K. Sylverne,"[4, 5]","Sadly this anime title seems to be overlooked a lot which it shouldn't be.  I orignally had rented this anime at a near by video rental store and liked it from the beginning.  Originally I bought it on VHS dubbed, but the near by comic book store that had it on VHS was so steep in price and the dub not so great that I ended up asking for a lot of VHS tapes for Christmas, and received this DVD instead >^^&lt;FIrst of all, the DVDs hold a lot of episodes on 'em, and Viz has released it so that the whole series is only on three DVDs.  Pretty conveinent if I do say so myself.  Second of all, I'm not that huge of a fan of sci-fi series.  But for whatever reason this series has seemed to captivate me.  What with more going on then just Key finding 30,000 friends there is something for almost everyone in this series.  The art is also somewhat different, and sometimes Key just seems plain old surreal looking.What's more, my friends mom bought this whole series for herself.  And loves it to death.  Definatly recommended to any mature anime fan.  This isn't a comedy folks, it's one serious drama, with a lot of mature content.  You've been forewarned, and you've been urged to buy it, so go buy it >^^&lt;",4,A great anime series,1025481600,"07 1, 2002",2002,1212,"['Sadly', 'anime', 'title', 'be', 'overlooked', 'lot', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'orignally', 'had', 'rented', 'anime', 'near', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'liked', 'beginning', 'Originally', 'bought', 'VHS', 'dubbed', 'near', 'comic', 'book', 'store', 'had', 'VHS', 'was', 'so', 'steep', 'price', 'dub', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'ended', 'up', 'asking', 'lot', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'Christmas', 'received', 'DVD', 'instead', '>', '^^', 'lt', 'FIrst', 'all', 'DVDs', 'hold', 'lot', 'episodes', 'Viz', 'released', 'so', 'whole', 'series', 'only', 'three', 'DVDs', 'Pretty', 'conveinent', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'Second', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'reason', 'series', 'seemed', 'captivate', 'What', 'more', 'going', 'then', 'just', 'Key', 'finding', '30,000', 'friends', 'something', 'almost', 'everyone', 'series', 'art', 'also', 'somewhat', 'different', 'sometimes', 'Key', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'surreal', 'looking.What', 'more', 'friends', 'mom', 'bought', 'whole', 'series', 'herself', 'death', 'Definatly', 'recommended', 'mature', 'anime', 'fan', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'folks', 'one', 'serious', 'drama', 'lot', 'mature', 'content', ""'ve"", 'been', 'forewarned', ""'ve"", 'been', 'urged', 'buy', 'so', 'go', 'buy', '>', '^^', 'lt']",N/A

You have to watch the next and the next and the next until you need the next disc. That's what I have to buy as soon as I can. All the characters are wonderfully designed. Especially Key. The story is what got me to buy it. It's very dark, but very interesting. Will Key really win the love of 30,000 friends? I have to know! I have to buy the other 2 discs! Take my advice: BUY KEY. It's worth the money. This is a great series.

The DVD is better because the video only has 3 episodes but  the DVD has 7 complete episodes.Ok, enough about the DVD.  This series  is great, and although dark at times has some very positive elements.  The  show isn't for little kids (it is very violent) but I think that maybe 13  year olds could handle it (but because of alot of ungraphic, but still  present, nudity it is up to the parent).  The first 7 episodes are great,  and the characters are spectacular.  Everyone is interesting and great to  watch.  The shows story is strange, but it is compelling and you just have  to see more.
