Martin Sheen plays the ""fourth wise man"" or fourth Magi who knew about the upcoming birth of The Messiah, like the three who did make it to see baby Jesus in Bethelem.Unfortunately, ""Artaban,"" as he was named, got sidetracked en route. He kept running into people in need and he helped each one by giving them the gifts he was intending for Christ. This went on for years, until he finally meets Jesus, at the cross.He is accompanied by Alan Arkin's pessimistic servant ""Orontes,"" who plays off Sheen's optimistic character with humorous results.To those who are repelled by any Biblical implications, this movie is simply an old-fashioned story more about giving, helping others out who are in need, than anything else....and if that's offensive to you, God help you!",4,Good Message About 'Giving',1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,1100,"['made-for-TV', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'anticipated', 'thanks', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'top', 'actors', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'message.This', 'fictional', 'Biblical', 'story', 'one', 'one', 'reflecting', 'regarding', 'where', 'hearts', 'lie', 'importance', 'helping', 'fellow', 'man', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'fourth', 'wise', 'man', 'fourth', 'Magi', 'who', 'knew', 'upcoming', 'birth', 'Messiah', 'three', 'who', 'did', 'make', 'see', 'baby', 'Jesus', 'Bethelem.Unfortunately', 'Artaban', 'was', 'named', 'got', 'sidetracked', 'route', 'kept', 'running', 'people', 'need', 'helped', 'one', 'giving', 'gifts', 'was', 'intending', 'Christ', 'went', 'years', 'finally', 'Jesus', 'cross.He', 'accompanied', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'pessimistic', 'servant', 'who', 'Sheen', 'optimistic', 'character', 'humorous', 'results.To', 'who', 'are', 'repelled', 'Biblical', 'implications', 'movie', 'simply', 'old-fashioned', 'story', 'more', 'giving', 'helping', 'others', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'need', 'anything', 'else', '.and', 'offensive', 'God', 'help']",N/A

He tried to find Jesus Christ along with the other three wise men, and he brought along three valuable gems to give Jesus. (One was a pearl) But he ended up giving them all away to other people. It was a wonderful illustration on how giving to others and making personal sacrifices for someone else's sake is like doing it for Jesus.And by the way, if you are thinking of getting that cartoon called ""The Three Wise Men"" just because Martin Sheen is in it, forget it.
