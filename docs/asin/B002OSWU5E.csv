All they did was chase, with a camera, 5 different people who were setting up a Rush show:  the lights guy, the sound guy, the effects guy, the instruments guy, and the road manager.  I simplify a bit, but that's basically it.Do we really need to hear about how the road manager arranges hotels for Rush tours?  Sheesh.  Or what vegetables Geddy's personal chef is making for him?  Documentaries about the influences on and development of their music are one thing, but if your level of interest in the band extends to wanting to know who among the road crew considers himself ""Geddy's friend"" and who doesn't, then I suggest you have psychological problems.I've always considered myself an enormous Rush fan, but this is the limit.  It would have been much more interesting if they had edited it down to an hour, an hour and a half.  But five hours!  You're gonna be completely sick of this by the time you're done watching it.

1281933,A1YCDZ4K4G0CN3,B002OSWU5E,David Carlin,"[2, 3]","This was a wonderful, very very detailed look into the making of putting on a show from the perspective of the road crew directors while Rush had toured during the Snakes and Arrow's period.The Chapters are broken down into Sound, Lights, Instrument, and overall management of directing the show from load off point.I was really impressed with the care and motivation these individuals put into their jobs.  It is common for them to work 16 hour long days to get a show into gear.Some of my favorite areas were Lighting.  ( Nothing can be put onto the stage until the rigging of sound and lights can be put into place).Too much to share here, but I intend to watch this over again.",5,Brings you on the road crew team,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,681,"['was', 'wonderful', 'very', 'very', 'detailed', 'look', 'making', 'putting', 'show', 'perspective', 'road', 'crew', 'directors', 'Rush', 'had', 'toured', 'Snakes', 'Arrow', 'period.The', 'Chapters', 'are', 'broken', 'down', 'Sound', 'Lights', 'Instrument', 'overall', 'management', 'directing', 'show', 'load', 'point.I', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'care', 'motivation', 'individuals', 'put', 'jobs', 'common', 'work', '16', 'hour', 'long', 'days', 'get', 'show', 'gear.Some', 'favorite', 'areas', 'were', 'Lighting', 'Nothing', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'stage', 'rigging', 'sound', 'lights', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'place', '.Too', 'much', 'share', 'here', 'intend', 'watch', 'over', 'again']",N/A

Everything you ever wanted to know (and more) about what's entailed in putting together a major show.

1281935,AENRHAKDM5GMP,B002OSWU5E,"J. Lockridge ""jllx""","[3, 4]","A REAL rock band, with the BIGGEST production in rock. Rush's stagehands lead you backstage. You don't get the posh and glitzy, ""star"" treatment---you see the HARD, and dangerous work these guys (and gals) do EVERY day, and the time constraints they're under. It's become so taken for granted that you go to a concert, and you expect good sound, good lights, and a glitch free show. There's no band like Rush live, and that is as much due to their FANTASTIC (best in the biz, most likely) road crew.If you love rock and roll, whether you care about Rush or not---get this. It is CHOCK full of GREAT behind the scenes stuff that I've really never seen on a DVD before.I think this is a very important work. I cannot tell you how impressed I was by the quantity and the quality. You get TWO great DVD's and there's NO filler. You'll be on the edge of your seat and TIRED by the end. Watching these folks, and biting your nails night after night might just do you in, lol.Enjoy this.

I had done this kind of work for one summer, so i knew a lot about what they were talking about. I am a huge Rush fan, but this is one item that I could do without. Seeing there stage set-up is not as cool as seeing them perform on stage. Love Rush, and I know that the crew works hard for the shows, but I do not need a chronicle of their work.
