It was also nice to see Kim Witley in another movie, I just love her style of comedy. This play conveys the message that through the love of GOD all things are possible and some people are worth second chances.",3,It was entertaining,1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,335,"['movie', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'tried', 'make', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'AGAIN', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Kim', 'Witley', 'movie', 'just', 'love', 'style', 'comedy', 'play', 'message', 'love', 'GOD', 'things', 'are', 'possible', 'people', 'are', 'worth', 'second', 'chances']",N/A

Madison,"[5, 9]","Since I mentioned in my review for Lord, All Men Can't Be Dogs, that Heaven Ain't Hard to Find is also ridiculous, I decided to submit my review for this play also to give specifics as to why I feel it is ridiculous.  I don't want to be negative without explaining why, and I don't want to be called a Hater, which is what some people call those who criticize their work.  First, let me say that I am far from being a Hater, I am pulling for black filmmakers and I am hoping when I pick up a black film that it is good.  It doesn't even have to be great, just at least be good rather than comprised of stereotypes & buffoonery because I am trying to get myself a good collection of black plays & movies with good story lines.  With that said, this movie was a mess.  Clearly, the budget was tight because most of the movie was held in an empty church.  The lead actor kept breaking out singing songs that weren't relevant to anything whatsoever.  It seems as if he was debuting his singing skills (and he does sing very well), rather than making sure this movie made sense.  Since I don't have a lot of space allowed I'm going to just give the worst scene of the entire movie that made me frown and say ""What the Hell?""  Lead singing actor was an inmate who escaped after hitting prison guard in the head.  Towards the end of the movie the prison guard who was knocked in the head and who was normal at the time showed up somehow mentally challenged, he is now speaking, walking & twisting his hand like he's mentally challenged, so the writer decided to use the same guy who was a guard as a mentally challenged guy.  I guess we weren't supposed to notice.  Anyway, that was the last straw for me.  This movie like many other gospel movies & plays decided after the majority of the movie was  pointless & foolish, they would try to give a serious message at the end.  That's like Jerry Springer having the audacity to try to give words of wisdom at the end of his show after all of that trash & foolishness has taken place.  This is my last review and I want to say to the filmmakers, your goal is to produce a film that both you and the viewers can be proud of.  This is not an opportunity to make an Ego Film that is just for you so you can tell friends & family you made a film, and so you can see your name across the screen.  If you produce a flop and get negative reviews that's a great loss for you because negative reviews result in no sales, so you can't recoup your money and you're stuck with a room or trunk filled with unwanted DVDs and you don't want that so please do better people.",1,Why???,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,2598,"['mentioned', 'review', 'Lord', 'All', 'Men', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Dogs', 'Heaven', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Hard', 'Find', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'decided', 'submit', 'review', 'play', 'also', 'give', 'specifics', 'why', 'feel', 'ridiculous', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'negative', 'explaining', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'called', 'Hater', 'what', 'people', 'call', 'who', 'criticize', 'work', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'far', 'being', 'Hater', 'am', 'pulling', 'black', 'filmmakers', 'am', 'hoping', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'black', 'film', 'good', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'be', 'great', 'just', 'least', 'be', 'good', 'rather', 'comprised', 'stereotypes', 'buffoonery', 'am', 'trying', 'get', 'good', 'collection', 'black', 'plays', 'movies', 'good', 'story', 'lines', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'mess', 'Clearly', 'budget', 'was', 'tight', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'held', 'empty', 'church', 'lead', 'actor', 'kept', 'breaking', 'out', 'singing', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'relevant', 'anything', 'whatsoever', 'was', 'debuting', 'singing', 'skills', 'sing', 'very', 'well', 'rather', 'making', 'sure', 'movie', 'made', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'space', 'allowed', ""'m"", 'going', 'just', 'give', 'worst', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'made', 'frown', 'say', 'What', 'Hell', 'Lead', 'singing', 'actor', 'was', 'inmate', 'who', 'escaped', 'hitting', 'prison', 'guard', 'head', 'end', 'movie', 'prison', 'guard', 'who', 'was', 'knocked', 'head', 'who', 'was', 'normal', 'time', 'showed', 'up', 'somehow', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'now', 'speaking', 'walking', 'twisting', 'hand', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'writer', 'decided', 'use', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'guard', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'guy', 'guess', 'were', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'notice', 'Anyway', 'was', 'last', 'straw', 'movie', 'many', 'other', 'gospel', 'movies', 'plays', 'decided', 'majority', 'movie', 'was', 'pointless', 'foolish', 'would', 'try', 'give', 'serious', 'message', 'end', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'having', 'audacity', 'try', 'give', 'words', 'wisdom', 'end', 'show', 'trash', 'foolishness', 'taken', 'place', 'last', 'review', 'want', 'say', 'filmmakers', 'goal', 'produce', 'film', 'viewers', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'not', 'opportunity', 'make', 'Ego', 'Film', 'just', 'can', 'tell', 'friends', 'family', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'name', 'screen', 'produce', 'flop', 'get', 'negative', 'reviews', 'great', 'loss', 'negative', 'reviews', 'result', 'sales', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recoup', 'money', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'room', 'trunk', 'filled', 'unwanted', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'so', 'please', 'do', 'better', 'people']",N/A
