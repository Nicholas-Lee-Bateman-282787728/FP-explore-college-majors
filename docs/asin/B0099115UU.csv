1587450,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0099115UU,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]",Watchable but unremarkable legal thriller.  Matters aren't helped that Dean Martin is woefully miscast as a crusading liberal lawyer.  Dino seems bored and would rather be ogling the Golddiggers or schmoozing with Foster Brooks.  Not a bad film but not worth the price of purchase.  Wait for it for free on Xfinity On Demand or Netflix.,3,Perry Mason With A Shot Of Bourbon,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,336,"['Watchable', 'unremarkable', 'legal', 'thriller', 'Matters', 'are', ""n't"", 'helped', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'crusading', 'liberal', 'lawyer', 'Dino', 'bored', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'ogling', 'Golddiggers', 'schmoozing', 'Foster', 'Brooks', 'Not', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'price', 'purchase', 'Wait', 'free', 'Xfinity', 'Demand', 'Netflix']",Mr. Ricco

1587454,A1R84LGQX6DMJ8,B0099115UU,Michael Serrano,"[15, 15]","I have been wanting to see this movie for many years and it finally came out. It was worth wait. Dean Martin's last leading role is a fine-though dated-movie. Dean plays a lawyer who get a case thrown out on a technicality. Creating a lot of hard feelings with the police. Soon after, the freed man goes on a killing spree. Killing two cops-however he is seen at each shooting, leaving Ricco to wonder who is really behind these killings. The movie shows it's age, but it's only a movie and fans of Dean Martin will be very pleased with the rare serious Dean Martin movie. I also had to admit I was surprised at the ending, it makes sense but I did not see it coming. A final note, it's neat to see all the ""regular"" cars in the movie, Firebirds,Cameros,Mustangs,Cougars, Chargers, all just the cars of the day.
