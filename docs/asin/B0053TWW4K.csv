This story had alot of cussing and if a woman being called the B word or a woman calling the man the B word is offensive then definitely dont watch this. This story is one that actually captured relationship issues from a male perspective. Bravo to the writers for making the ending a shock. Even though this movie just ended abruptly there was not that wonderful happy ending that normally happens in movies it was indicative of what really should have happened.,4,Fine Men GALORE!,1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,542,"['are', 'fine', 'men', 'movie', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'eye', 'candy', 'alone', 'story', 'had', 'alot', 'cussing', 'woman', 'being', 'called', 'B', 'word', 'woman', 'calling', 'man', 'B', 'word', 'offensive', 'then', 'definitely', 'dont', 'watch', 'story', 'one', 'actually', 'captured', 'relationship', 'issues', 'male', 'perspective', 'Bravo', 'writers', 'making', 'ending', 'shock', 'Even', 'movie', 'just', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'was', 'not', 'wonderful', 'happy', 'ending', 'normally', 'movies', 'was', 'indicative', 'what', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'happened']",The Bachelor Party

1440702,ATAO781X1B6SY,B0053TWW4K,John J. Martinez,"[16, 16]","Let's get the basics out of the way:The video is good, the audio was good. 90 minutes, recorded in hi-def. Recorded at the wonderful Nate Holden Performing Arts Center of the Ebony Repertory Theatre, or ERT, in Los Angeles, California, a great venue. Written, produced and directed by Don B. Welch (or Donald Welch, according to the IMDB website).The DVD is barebones, only the chapters selection and a few gallery pictures are available.Now for the meat of the review:Everyone has jumped on the Deep South chitlin' type productions, performed in front of a live audience, and with a typical morality message intertwined throughout, complete with Black stereotypes (Big Mama, the down lo brotha, the skank sister/cousin/relative, a lot of baffoonery, etc.) and a redemption at the end for someone and of course, lots of gospel-type singing. I think that the main goal here was not only tell a similar story, but also to cash in on a trend that I think has pretty much burned out for a lot of Black folk.This is a new one on me, though. This is NOT your typical 'Tyler Perry-style' production.This is a straight-forward story about the before-and-after of a Black man's bachelor party, and all the male drama (and a little female drama) they can squeeze in here. There's drinking, cussing, sexual situations, a stripper who entices the groom to try and sleep with him in the other room, accusations, and a whole lot of other things happen that propel the story to it's very odd conclusion.Now for the positives and negatives...THE POSITIVES:This 'play' reads like a typical soap opera, filled with stuff straight out of so many different other movies, plays and TV shows, all you needed to do here was take a scene from each one, write them on the back of a playing card, shuffle them up and then string them up together and you'd have this. But I still watched it and enjoyed the show regardless. The twist ending is not what I expected it to be, and it left me hanging. Will there be a sequel to this?, I asked myself.The list of actors and actresses is impressive, from the ever-beautiful Essence Atkins, hunk Christian Keyes, the sassy Caryn Ward, strong performer Lamman Rucker, and singer/rapper/actor Ginuwine (among the others) playing their parts very well - these people are professionals, and I felt they were comfortable and believable in their roles.THE NEGATIVES:THIS WAS NOT PERFORMED IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE, and the canned laughter and applause does NOT help the situation. It may be a three-act play, but the ENTIRE play is performed on one set with no feeling that there was anyone (other than the stagehands and lighting crew) watching the performance. It felt cold, and I didn't really feel it the way I should have.This was obviously done no-budget, and if the actors got paid 'scale' financially I'd be surprised...In summation, I'm giving the performances by everyone 5 good stars - I liked them, and their choice of lines was a bit cheesy, but I kind of enjoyed it start to finish. Because of the lame production, the lack of live audience, and the really blah-blah typical plot, I've got to drag it down a few stars to only three, and I'm being REALLY REALLY generous in keeping the third star.If you've never seen a Mr. Perry production, and you've got 90 minutes to spare, it's okay. But please, don't look into this for anything socially redeeming. Don B. Welch's attempt here worked for me, but only a little.It's a bit of brain candy to get you through a lazy afternoon, or whatever, but that's about it.",3,"It was, as they say, ""a-i-i-i-i-ght..."" but the production value?
