I still have the old VHS I recorded every episode on.  I was starting to think this show would never make it to DVD.Andy Richter Controls the Universe is one of those gems who's life was cut short.  In short, it was TOO good for TV.  With so many cookie-cutter sitcoms littering the airwaves, truely outstanding writing like this was underapreciated by audiences that only laugh when prompted by a laugh track.This is the show that really set the ground work for shows to come both in it's style, wit, and gag-type humor.Andy Richter returned years later with Andy Barker: PI.  If you saw that show, and not this one, they are night and day difference.  PI just wasn't funny, but 'Universe' brought a comedic brilliance I fear we will not see again.Andy also showed up on another amazing show, Arrested Development, one of my favorites.  If any show can be put on equal ground with AD, it's this one.The show is unique, extremely well-written, and incredibly fun, and features a perfect cast.  Buy this show, it will be worth every penny and more.",5,One of the funniest shows to grace the airwaves,1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,1160,"['was', 'one', 'few', 'fortunate', 'ones', 'who', 'caught', 'show', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'immediately', 'loved', 'still', 'have', 'old', 'VHS', 'recorded', 'episode', 'was', 'starting', 'think', 'show', 'would', 'never', 'make', 'DVD.Andy', 'Richter', 'Controls', 'Universe', 'one', 'gems', 'who', 'life', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'short', 'was', 'TOO', 'good', 'TV', 'so', 'many', 'cookie-cutter', 'sitcoms', 'littering', 'airwaves', 'truely', 'outstanding', 'writing', 'was', 'underapreciated', 'audiences', 'only', 'laugh', 'when', 'prompted', 'laugh', 'track.This', 'show', 'really', 'set', 'ground', 'work', 'shows', 'come', 'style', 'wit', 'gag-type', 'humor.Andy', 'Richter', 'returned', 'years', 'later', 'Andy', 'Barker', 'PI', 'saw', 'show', 'not', 'one', 'are', 'night', 'day', 'difference', 'PI', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'brought', 'comedic', 'brilliance', 'fear', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'again.Andy', 'also', 'showed', 'up', 'amazing', 'show', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'one', 'favorites', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'equal', 'ground', 'AD', 'one.The', 'show', 'unique', 'extremely', 'well-written', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'perfect', 'cast', 'Buy', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'penny', 'more']",Andy Richter Controls the Universe: The Complete Series
1227243,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B001PKHS6I,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[2, 2]","""Andy Richter Controls The Universe""(2002)-----------------------------------------------------Looking back on Andy Richter's ill-fated network TV show, seven years after its ignoble cancellation, it's amazing how well it stands up and how funny it still is. One of the best workplace comedies ever aired, ""Andy Richter Controls The Universe"" has a great cast, with Paget Brewster as Andy's hard-bitten but sympathetic boss and Jonathan Slavin who is absolutely brilliant as his ultra-neurotic co-worker Byron. Richter is, of course, great as the not-too-nerdy, not-too-brainy star of the show, a lonely, insecure tech writer at a giant company who is constantly replaying the events of his life with constant ""what-if-I-could-rewind-that-scene"" replay fantasies that are the core of the show's humor.  The characters and their relationships to each other steadily grow as the show goes on, and ARCTU, despite its untimely demise, ultimately emerged as a fairly complete, whole package. One of the more notable victims of shortsighted network programming decisions -- right up there with ""Firefly,"" ""My So-Called Life"", ""Freaks & Geeks"" and Joan Cusack's ""What About Joan?"" -- the Andy Richter show is still timely and entertaining. If you missed it the first time around, take this opportunity to enjoy it now.  You'll have a blast! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film review blog)",5,A situation comedy gem...

Both have done well on their own but their chemistry together is undeniable. Conan, of course, chugged along in late night. Richter has appeared in many films and sitcoms, but his best work was on two shows he starred in: Andy Barker PI (which he says will be coming out on DVD shortly) and Andy Richter Controls The Universe: The Complete Series ($39.98; Paramount). This workplace comedy had a great cast (including Jonathan Slavin as a nebbishy buddy and James Patrick Stuart as a Ken doll-handsome guy for whom everything came easy), a playful sensibility (episodes about Andy dating a racist girl who was hot, etc) and fantasy sequences that were genuinely clever and fun.

(Interestingly enough the establishing shots for his office say ""Duke and Duke"" and were actually borrowed from the Eddie Murphy movie Trading Places.)Owing to his low standing in the firm, Andy is early on saddled with a zany office mate/illustrator and along with other friends from their office they spend more time on silliness than any serious defense contracting.  In fact, in one episode, they actually make it so that a missile guidance system malfunctions.Just as unlucky in love as he's unproductive at work, viewers are also treated to the many misadventures of Andy's love life including an episode where he starts dating an anti semite and wrestles with the question of just how prejudice he's willing to tolerate in a romantic partner.  Hint:  according to the show, you can allow more prejudice in your partner if you counter balance it with good deeds towards the community against whom your partner is prejudiced.And speaking of prejudices there's an especially funny episode which guest stars Jon Cryer as a boss from Hell.  Andy and Co decide to make his life miserable by putting cow dung on his desk when Andy learns that Cryer actually suffers from an incurable disease.  By dint of lucky plot timing Andy says the immortal line:  ""Oh we did not know that you didn't like cow dung on your desk.""This is a seriously funny show and just like when I first watched it I lauged out loud during the episodes.Take it from me:  Andy Richter rules!",5,Richter Rules Big Time,1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,1996,"['want', 'people', 'wear', 'puppy', 'suit', 'meaning', 'costume', 'look', 'puppy', 'one', 'many', 'pockets', 'can', 'put', 'pupppies.These', 'other', 'gems', 'are', 'contained', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'short', 'lived', 'FOX', 'show', 'why', 'cancelled', 'left', 'other', 'programming', 'going', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', '.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'day', 'day', 'activities', 'day', 'dreams', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'technical', 'writer', 'defense', 'contracting', 'firm', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'establishing', 'shots', 'office', 'say', 'Duke', 'Duke', 'were', 'actually', 'borrowed', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'movie', 'Trading', 'Places', 'Owing', 'low', 'standing', 'firm', 'Andy', 'early', 'saddled', 'zany', 'office', 'mate/illustrator', 'other', 'friends', 'office', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'silliness', 'serious', 'defense', 'contracting', 'fact', 'one', 'episode', 'actually', 'make', 'missile', 'guidance', 'system', 'malfunctions.Just', 'unlucky', 'love', 'unproductive', 'work', 'viewers', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'many', 'misadventures', 'Andy', 'love', 'life', 'including', 'episode', 'where', 'dating', 'anti', 'semite', 'wrestles', 'question', 'just', 'how', 'prejudice', 'willing', 'tolerate', 'romantic', 'partner', 'Hint', 'according', 'show', 'can', 'allow', 'more', 'prejudice', 'partner', 'counter', 'balance', 'good', 'deeds', 'community', 'whom', 'partner', 'prejudiced.And', 'speaking', 'prejudices', 'especially', 'funny', 'episode', 'guest', 'stars', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'boss', 'Hell', 'Andy', 'Co', 'decide', 'make', 'life', 'miserable', 'putting', 'cow', 'dung', 'desk', 'when', 'Andy', 'Cryer', 'actually', 'incurable', 'disease', 'dint', 'lucky', 'plot', 'timing', 'Andy', 'immortal', 'line', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'cow', 'dung', 'desk', 'seriously', 'funny', 'show', 'just', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'lauged', 'out', 'loud', 'episodes.Take', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'rules']",Andy Richter Controls the Universe: The Complete Series
