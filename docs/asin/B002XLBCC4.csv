1297797,A3GPL5JEP3G1VS,B002XLBCC4,Hmph,"[6, 6]","When Abu Raed goes around wearing a pilot's hat, a group of children in Amman, Jordan beg to hear about his career and travels. At first, Abu Raed insists that he is no pilot, but eventually, he begins telling children stories about Greece, New York, and everywhere in between to add excitement to their poverty-stricken lives. One of the kids sets out to expose Abu Raed, and he eventually proves the old man is merely a janitor at the airport. Though Abu Raed's stories become discredited, he still tries to improve the lives of some of the children. In particular, he helps to keep one boy in school and protects another one--ironically, the boy who tore his travel stories apart--from physical and psychological abuse.Considering that this movie was Jordan's first in 50 years, and was done with a pretty small budget, it is a very admirable story. The man playing Abu Raed has acted in minor roles before, but nearly all the children casted are first-time actors from refugee camps. The scenery is one of the film's best assets: just as Abu Raed tries to bring the rest of the world to these children in Amman, the director is presenting Amman to viewers around the world, who may otherwise have not been able to see the city and both its upper and working class districts.The messages the movie sends out are great: that even a man of small means can create a better life for the people in his community. Moreover, even a poor janitor can enrich his life and the life of others through books, as that's where Abu Raed got the inspiration for his stories. The movie made me tear a little in the end as well. Anyone who enjoys sentimental movies will like this one.",5,Even a small man can make a big difference,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1669,"['When', 'Abu', 'Raed', 'around', 'wearing', 'pilot', 'hat', 'group', 'children', 'Amman', 'Jordan', 'beg', 'hear', 'career', 'travels', 'first', 'Abu', 'Raed', 'pilot', 'eventually', 'telling', 'children', 'stories', 'Greece', 'New', 'York', 'everywhere', 'add', 'excitement', 'poverty-stricken', 'lives', 'One', 'kids', 'out', 'expose', 'Abu', 'Raed', 'eventually', 'old', 'man', 'merely', 'janitor', 'airport', 'Abu', 'Raed', 'stories', 'become', 'discredited', 'still', 'improve', 'lives', 'children', 'particular', 'keep', 'one', 'boy', 'school', 'one', 'ironically', 'boy', 'who', 'tore', 'travel', 'stories', 'apart', 'physical', 'psychological', 'abuse.Considering', 'movie', 'was', 'Jordan', 'first', '50', 'years', 'was', 'done', 'pretty', 'small', 'budget', 'very', 'admirable', 'story', 'man', 'playing', 'Abu', 'Raed', 'acted', 'minor', 'roles', 'nearly', 'children', 'casted', 'are', 'first-time', 'actors', 'refugee', 'camps', 'scenery', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'assets', 'just', 'Abu', 'Raed', 'tries', 'bring', 'rest', 'world', 'children', 'Amman', 'director', 'presenting', 'Amman', 'viewers', 'world', 'who', 'may', 'otherwise', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'city', 'upper', 'working', 'class', 'districts.The', 'movie', 'out', 'are', 'great', 'even', 'man', 'small', 'means', 'can', 'create', 'better', 'life', 'people', 'community', 'Moreover', 'even', 'poor', 'janitor', 'can', 'enrich', 'life', 'life', 'others', 'books', 'where', 'Abu', 'Raed', 'got', 'inspiration', 'stories', 'movie', 'made', 'tear', 'little', 'end', 'as', 'well', 'Anyone', 'who', 'sentimental', 'movies', 'will', 'like', 'one']",N/A

Finding a discarded pilot's hat in a rubbish bin, he playfully sports it as he walks from the bus stop to his home. A local pack of children decide he must be a pilot and beg him to share his adventures with them.  He insists that he isn't a pilot but finally gives in and creates stories, inspiring them to believe that they can become somebody who has a meaningful life.  But this is just the beginning.  Abu becomes involved in the lives of two of the youngsters whose fathers abuse them - one by making him sell candy on the street instead of going to school, the other by physical violence to him and his mother.  What Raed discovers is the terrible ambiguity of attempting to set things right in the world.  He also discovers his own capacity for forgiveness, love, and sacrifice.  This is a lovely film.

1297800,A1FNW6H983I87V,B002XLBCC4,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[4, 4]","This Jordanian film, nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Foreign Film division, is the story of an aging widower who is a janitor at the airport in Amman, Jordan.  Mistaken by neighborhood kids as an airline pilot, he begins to tell stories of travel and far away places that awe these poor children. The story develops as ""Captain"" Raed gets to the know the kids and the challenges they are facing at home. What I like about so many foreign films is that they are built on character development not fancy dialogue or non-stop action.  They actually make you think about the characters and what's going on in their lives and what the film is trying to say. At the end of the film, it leaves you wondering about some of the characters and what might have happened. Foreign films often do not have nice, neat, tidy endings like American films. There is some ambiguity. This is true of Captain Raed. If slick screenplay and unbelievable CGI's of action are your thing (nothing wrong with that) this will probably not interest you. If you enjoy realistic characters and a good story this is a worth watching.  It is also a slice of life and humanity and geography in a country many of us don't know much about - Jordan.
