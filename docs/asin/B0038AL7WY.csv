Meets guys on line, one he likes, continues to be closeted and the guy dumps him because of this. Room mate is a basket case.

In the ending he is driving his brothers car in the countryside, buoyed by who knows what and calls the now miraculously undepressed woman (they visit a cemetery just before) to paint his bedroom wall (and claims that the basket case room mate would like that).

All these gentle people so caring, loving,  uncertain, hurting, yearning  tossed together by chance, by memory, by birth, are palpable, real. Cause and effect are subtle. Events just might be synchronous.  Watch for the little things, the vignettes.  Mother looking through her son's grade-school notebook at Leo's drawing , the older sister moving a photo to look at one hidden out-of-sight, the pills on the floor, the apartment owner's graciousness, mother and child at the cemetery and that little smile.The editing flows easily.  Good pacing and musical background.  You will lose yourself in this. Life is like that.I'm in agreement with the other two earlier reviews, except for the number of stars and that, for me.  Cara is an important part of the story. There was something very genuine in the portrayals that moved me. Perhaps South American cinema has become the unHollywood.  I hope.

1330271,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B0038AL7WY,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[6, 10]",".......""It's Leo...and I want Out!""NOTES: Possible Spoilers Ahead / My preferred Star-Rating would be Half-Star more (He's lovable) / This review based on earlier released European DVD version obtained through Amazon.com/UK((  FULL DISCLOSURE-----STOP at this point.....IF what you're anticipating, sex scene-wise, is anything more than a few tame love-making shots.  But continue on.....IF you can withstand a little trip back to a place so many of us, in our pasts, dwelt:  A lonely....sad....emotionally draining place....that's called ""THE CLOSET""  ))As your trip Guide through this unpretentious little film, you'll follow along after the sweetest of guys, who's called Leo Brasetti.  Yes, he's as wonderful a young man as you could ever hope to meet / hook up with.....IF he could only figure out who and what he is.  (Some Guide, indeed!).  Oh sure, he knows deep down, BUT the thing is there are just all these fears of discovery.....all these people he would be disappointing.....all these other excuses we, ourselves, used for our own inability to be ""out and proud"" (oh, you were different....well, Congrats to you!).  So, you're gonna meet him.....follow him through some trials and tribulations.....until maybe you begin to see that glimmer of hope which will make the time you've spent together all worthwhile.Now, to get back on track with this confused young man....let's just say he's someone so choked up over trying to be the person he was born to be, that his life has become a turmoil.  Yet, in his midst....right there in plain sight....are ones accepting of his being himself.  Foremost is a marvelous mother who point blank tells him she just wants him ""....to have someone of his own---whether it be girlfriend or boyfriend.""  And then there's that wonderful, old therapist who is trying to pull it all out and into the open, as painlessly as possible.  But our Leo is so tightly wrapped, their words don't seem to get through.  It is so bad that he even worries what his several years deceased father might think of him.  So, who could blame any of you readers of this now, if you've begun to wonder:  How can any but the best of actors convey this kind of emotional turmoil.....how is this relatively new actor, with only one unknown film under his belt.....gonna put it all across to me?  Well, Viewers, I'm here to tell you that this Mart&iacute;n Rodr&iacute;guez, this young Latino ""hottie,"" will project Leo so vividly, so discomfortingly....yet so endearingly....that you'll want to enfold him in your own arms and ease his confusion.  This reviewer knows nothing of South America's pool of young male actors willing to portray a gay character, but I cannot imagine there could ever have been a better selection for doing that than Martin.  And no way can I see any other actor possessing his unconscious and quirky little way of sucking in / chewing on his lower lip during emotional and stressful times....it's just who Rodriguez is (yes, again, endearing).  Then there's Gerardo Beg&eacute;rez, as Leo's wanna-be lover (Seba / Sebastien). He is first-rate....and a fine selection for putting across the playful protectiveness his character needs to project.A spinoff or side story (to me, unfortunately, taking up near half the film's running time) involves Leo's reconnection and interaction with a former primary schoolmate---Caro by name---along with some of her family members.  In her, we're given an at times catatonic, depressed young lady who, to my thinking, was likely thrown into the mix, by Writer / Director Enrique Buchichio, to give us more insight into Leo's amazing empathy for others.  I will leave further comment on Caro and her storyline to other reviewers of this film.To end this up, let me just acknowledge there may be some of you who ask why this small film would end with Leo deciding upon a little road trip, and even see it as more of his avoiding reality.  However, I believe Buchichio is showing it as that final little journey of self-discovery for our Leo.  Showing that all will turn out well (as any gay romantic would wish) and giving us a wonderful, final wide-screen shot of the car windshield and close-up of Leo's face (yes, you CAN see his thoughts), as it lights up in a small smile during the film's last split seconds.  Yes, that's right, Leo IS telling us something.  And then you know.....you just KNOW, in that very moment:  He's decided to throw OPEN the door to ""LEO'S ROOM.""",3,KNOCK...KNOCK......Who's there?..........,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,4460,"['Leo', 'want', 'Out', 'NOTES', 'Possible', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead', '/', 'My', 'preferred', 'Star-Rating', 'would', 'be', 'Half-Star', 'more', 'lovable', '/', 'review', 'based', 'earlier', 'released', 'European', 'DVD', 'version', 'obtained', 'Amazon.com/UK', 'FULL', 'DISCLOSURE', '-STOP', 'point', 'what', ""'re"", 'anticipating', 'sex', 'scene-wise', 'anything', 'more', 'few', 'tame', 'love-making', 'shots', 'continue', 'can', 'withstand', 'little', 'trip', 'back', 'place', 'so', 'many', 'pasts', 'dwelt', 'lonely', '.sad', '.emotionally', 'draining', 'place', '.that', 'called', 'CLOSET', 'trip', 'Guide', 'unpretentious', 'little', 'film', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'along', 'sweetest', 'guys', 'who', 'called', 'Leo', 'Brasetti', 'Yes', 'as', 'wonderful', 'young', 'man', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'meet', '/', 'hook', 'up', '..IF', 'could', 'only', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'Guide', 'indeed', 'Oh', 'sure', 'deep', 'down', 'BUT', 'thing', 'are', 'just', 'fears', 'discovery', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'disappointing', 'other', 'excuses', 'used', 'own', 'inability', 'be', 'proud', 'oh', 'were', 'different', '.well', 'Congrats', 'So', ""'re"", 'gon', 'meet', '..follow', 'trials', 'tribulations', '..until', 'maybe', 'begin', 'see', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'will', 'make', 'time', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'together', 'worthwhile.Now', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'confused', 'young', 'man', '.let', 'just', 'say', 'someone', 'so', 'choked', 'up', 'trying', 'be', 'person', 'was', 'born', 'be', 'life', 'become', 'turmoil', 'midst', '.right', 'plain', 'sight', '.are', 'ones', 'accepting', 'being', 'Foremost', 'marvelous', 'mother', 'who', 'point', 'blank', 'tells', 'just', '.to', 'have', 'someone', 'own', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'boyfriend', 'then', 'wonderful', 'old', 'therapist', 'who', 'trying', 'pull', 'out', 'open', 'as', 'painlessly', 'possible', 'Leo', 'so', 'tightly', 'wrapped', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'so', 'bad', 'even', 'what', 'several', 'years', 'deceased', 'father', 'might', 'think', 'So', 'who', 'could', 'blame', 'readers', 'now', ""'ve"", 'begun', 'wonder', 'How', 'can', 'best', 'actors', 'convey', 'kind', 'emotional', 'turmoil', '..how', 'relatively', 'new', 'actor', 'only', 'one', 'unknown', 'film', 'belt', 'gon', 'put', 'Well', 'Viewers', ""'m"", 'here', 'tell', 'Mart', 'iacute', 'Rodr', 'iacute', 'guez', 'young', 'Latino', 'hottie', 'will', 'project', 'Leo', 'so', 'vividly', 'so', 'discomfortingly', '.yet', 'so', 'endearingly', ""'ll"", 'want', 'enfold', 'own', 'arms', 'ease', 'confusion', 'reviewer', 'nothing', 'South', 'America', 'pool', 'young', 'male', 'actors', 'willing', 'portray', 'gay', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'there', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'selection', 'doing', 'Martin', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'actor', 'possessing', 'unconscious', 'quirky', 'little', 'way', 'sucking', '/', 'chewing', 'lower', 'lip', 'emotional', 'stressful', 'times', '.it', 'just', 'who', 'Rodriguez', 'yes', 'again', 'endearing', 'Then', 'Gerardo', 'Beg', 'eacute', 'rez', 'Leo', 'wanna-be', 'lover', 'Seba', '/', 'Sebastien', 'first-rate', '.and', 'fine', 'selection', 'putting', 'playful', 'protectiveness', 'character', 'project.A', 'spinoff', 'side', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'taking', 'up', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'Leo', 'reconnection', 'interaction', 'former', 'primary', 'schoolmate', '-Caro', 'name', '-along', 'family', 'members', ""'re"", 'given', 'times', 'catatonic', 'depressed', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'thinking', 'was', 'likely', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Writer', '/', 'Director', 'Enrique', 'Buchichio', 'give', 'more', 'insight', 'Leo', 'amazing', 'empathy', 'others', 'will', 'leave', 'further', 'comment', 'Caro', 'storyline', 'other', 'reviewers', 'film.To', 'end', 'up', 'let', 'just', 'acknowledge', 'may', 'be', 'who', 'ask', 'why', 'small', 'film', 'would', 'end', 'Leo', 'deciding', 'little', 'road', 'trip', 'even', 'see', 'more', 'avoiding', 'reality', 'However', 'believe', 'Buchichio', 'showing', 'final', 'little', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'Leo', 'Showing', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'gay', 'romantic', 'would', 'wish', 'giving', 'wonderful', 'final', 'wide-screen', 'shot', 'car', 'windshield', 'close-up', 'Leo', 'face', 'yes', 'CAN', 'see', 'thoughts', 'up', 'small', 'smile', 'film', 'last', 'split', 'seconds', 'Yes', 'right', 'Leo', 'IS', 'telling', 'something', 'then', 'know', '..you', 'just', 'KNOW', 'very', 'moment', 'decided', 'throw', 'OPEN', 'door', 'LEO', 'ROOM']",N/A
