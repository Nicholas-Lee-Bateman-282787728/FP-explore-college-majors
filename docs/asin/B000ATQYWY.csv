Although this series doesn't have alot of blood or gore, the suspense comes from shadows, glimpes or ideas the stories portray. Some humor is added by Darren Mcgavin as the bumbling Kolchak. While trying to convince the police he is not insane or just plain seeing things, Kolchak manages to solve the murder or mystery of this once weekly series. Series was taken from the movie, ""The Night Stalker"", about a vampire who terrorizes Las Vegas. Some of my favorite episodes include, The Ripper, Chopper, Horror In The Heights and Demon In Lace.

I like the plots, as they're interesting & with many lines of humor mixing with the supernatural. I also like Simon Oakland as his boss. Kolchak is of the old school of reporters like Edgar R. Morrow & Ernie Pyle, just updated to horror school. It's interesting to see the big cars used back then & the fashions.

933474,A1D22OU25XABAK,B000ATQYWY,Baranabus,"[1, 4]","If you remember this as a kid, you may find this a fun trip down memory lane. However, like some have said, sometimes, people wonder if they should've left their memories in the past and not revisited what scared them at age 5, since those films will appear stupid and bad as an adult. That's the nostalgic's dilemma, always. But if you enjoy regressing to 70s badness, this will appeal to you. It's also proof that the old rule of what you don't see is scarier than what you do- there are some dumb effects here that are laughable.Also, it is very dark, literally; I don't know if that's due to a poor transfer, as others have complained, or partly due to the fact that it was likely photographed in very dark lighting for a spooky effect and the limitations of the times, and the budgets, produced a flat effect visually. You can see how dark photography also influenced its thematic offspring, ""The X Files"", where the photography technology was miles above technically and you get much more depth of field and complexity of imagery.This is probably of interest to fans of this particular genre, but not to horror fans in general. If you want a good scare, you won't find much here, especially if you are accustomed to CGI, and Blue-Ray/hi-def etc etc. you will likely be frustrated by the poor quality. But if you're like me and you grew up watching low-fi stuff, you might have some fun with this.Also, Darren McGavin's cliched yet fun gumshoe act saves the day; his personality really carries this show.Post-script: I have re-watched more of this and how could I have only given it 3 stars? This is the bomb. Sure, it's not quite scary but so entertaining and it has that weird early 70s feel to it; my inner child squeals with glee watching stuff that was so hard to get permission to watch when I was little. It was also pretty risque for its time- lots of hookers, massage parlors, etc. This is sort of like ""Streets of San francisco meets Night Gallery."". TV has not been this great since; the era just had its own feel that can't be replicated. Also, I find the lack of gore a relief from the gross-outs on TV now. What would've been an R movie in the 70s is on Criminal Minds (which I like) and CSI all the time. It just gets disgusting, stressful, and a little too close to the sickness of the real world to be entertaining. This show is so removed from reality that it's pure joy.The snappy dialogue is also very fun; and again, Darren McGavin is perfect, even if they never gave him more than one suit to wear. It's also interesting that McGavin was a noir actor, and his boss was the Dr. in ""Psycho"", so they bring pedigree to what could've been a really bad show had it been handled wrong.I am loving and cherishing this!",5,70s fans and kitsch fans will love this- a delight,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,2738,"['remember', 'kid', 'may', 'find', 'fun', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'However', 'have', 'said', 'sometimes', 'people', 'wonder', 'should', ""'ve"", 'left', 'memories', 'past', 'not', 'revisited', 'what', 'scared', 'age', '5', 'films', 'will', 'appear', 'stupid', 'bad', 'adult', 'nostalgic', 'dilemma', 'always', 'enjoy', 'regressing', '70s', 'badness', 'will', 'appeal', 'also', 'proof', 'old', 'rule', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'scarier', 'what', 'do-', 'are', 'dumb', 'effects', 'here', 'are', 'laughable.Also', 'very', 'dark', 'literally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'due', 'poor', 'transfer', 'others', 'have', 'complained', 'partly', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'likely', 'photographed', 'very', 'dark', 'lighting', 'spooky', 'effect', 'limitations', 'times', 'budgets', 'produced', 'flat', 'effect', 'visually', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'dark', 'photography', 'also', 'influenced', 'thematic', 'offspring', 'X', 'Files', 'where', 'photography', 'technology', 'was', 'miles', 'technically', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'field', 'complexity', 'imagery.This', 'probably', 'interest', 'fans', 'particular', 'genre', 'not', 'horror', 'fans', 'general', 'want', 'good', 'scare', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'here', 'especially', 'are', 'accustomed', 'CGI', 'Blue-Ray/hi-def', 'etc', 'etc', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'frustrated', 'poor', 'quality', ""'re"", 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'low-fi', 'stuff', 'might', 'have', 'fun', 'this.Also', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'cliched', 'yet', 'fun', 'gumshoe', 'act', 'day', 'personality', 'really', 'show.Post-script', 'have', 're-watched', 'more', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'given', '3', 'stars', 'bomb', 'Sure', 'not', 'quite', 'scary', 'so', 'entertaining', 'weird', 'early', '70s', 'feel', 'inner', 'child', 'squeals', 'glee', 'watching', 'stuff', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'permission', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'risque', 'time-', 'lots', 'hookers', 'massage', 'parlors', 'etc', 'sort', 'Streets', 'San', 'francisco', 'meets', 'Night', 'Gallery.', 'TV', 'not', 'been', 'great', 'era', 'just', 'had', 'own', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'replicated', 'Also', 'find', 'lack', 'gore', 'relief', 'gross-outs', 'TV', 'now', 'What', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'R', 'movie', '70s', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'like', 'CSI', 'time', 'just', 'disgusting', 'stressful', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'sickness', 'real', 'world', 'be', 'entertaining', 'show', 'so', 'removed', 'reality', 'pure', 'joy.The', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'also', 'very', 'fun', 'again', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'perfect', 'even', 'never', 'gave', 'more', 'one', 'suit', 'wear', 'also', 'interesting', 'McGavin', 'was', 'noir', 'actor', 'boss', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Psycho', 'bring', 'pedigree', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'really', 'bad', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'wrong.I', 'am', 'loving', 'cherishing']",N/A

In fact, I don't think I knew anyone else that watched the show in its first run - or at least would admit to watching it. Canceled after only twenty episodes in a Friday night timeslot, it was pretty much forgotten until twenty years later when its basic format became the inspiration for the X-Files. Kolchak was a reporter on the trail of the supernatural. Like murders following Jessica Fletcher in ""Murder She Wrote"", the stories would sometimes find Kolchak rather than Kolchak always chasing the story. What made this series different from TV shows prior to it was that the government was shown to be suppressing attempts by Kolchak to get at the truth in just about every instance. This was a first in TV shows, and is possibly attributable to the fact that this show premiered about a month after Watergate blew wide open and the president was forced to resign. Although there are many  similarities between this show and The X-Files, Carl Kolchak was no Fox Mulder in appearance or style. Like Peter Falk's Columbo, Kolchak wore crumpled attire and had an annoying way about him, but he did get results. Also, each episode of Kolchak was pretty much self-contained. There was no long-running story arc, such as Mulder's search for the truth in what he believed to be the alien abduction of his sister driving him to look for proof of alien existence. If you like shows about the supernatural and you can handle a little 1970's nostalgia and some cheesy special effects, I advise you give this series a try.",4,A series that has gotten to be more  appreciated with time,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,1564,"['Kolchak', 'was', 'vastly', 'underappreciated', 'day', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'knew', 'anyone', 'else', 'watched', 'show', 'first', 'run', 'least', 'would', 'admit', 'watching', 'Canceled', 'only', 'twenty', 'episodes', 'Friday', 'night', 'timeslot', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'basic', 'format', 'became', 'inspiration', 'X-Files', 'Kolchak', 'was', 'reporter', 'trail', 'supernatural', 'murders', 'following', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'stories', 'would', 'sometimes', 'find', 'Kolchak', 'rather', 'Kolchak', 'always', 'chasing', 'story', 'What', 'made', 'series', 'different', 'TV', 'shows', 'prior', 'was', 'government', 'was', 'shown', 'be', 'suppressing', 'attempts', 'Kolchak', 'get', 'truth', 'just', 'instance', 'was', 'first', 'TV', 'shows', 'possibly', 'attributable', 'fact', 'show', 'premiered', 'month', 'Watergate', 'blew', 'wide', 'open', 'president', 'was', 'forced', 'resign', 'are', 'many', 'similarities', 'show', 'X-Files', 'Carl', 'Kolchak', 'was', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'appearance', 'style', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Columbo', 'Kolchak', 'wore', 'crumpled', 'attire', 'had', 'annoying', 'way', 'did', 'get', 'results', 'Also', 'episode', 'Kolchak', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'self-contained', 'was', 'long-running', 'story', 'arc', 'such', 'Mulder', 'search', 'truth', 'what', 'believed', 'be', 'alien', 'abduction', 'sister', 'driving', 'look', 'proof', 'alien', 'existence', 'like', 'shows', 'supernatural', 'can', 'handle', 'little', '1970', 'nostalgia', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'advise', 'give', 'series', 'try']",N/A

Freeman,"[2, 2]","To anyone who grew up in the 70's as I did, this show will probably stick out in your mind as one of the most original horror flicks of it's time due to it's original themes and the charismatic Darren McGavin, who played Carl Kolchak to clumsy and rumpled perfection. One of the long-standing ironies of the show was that no matter how many monsters he fought or how much evidence gathered, no one believed him, so the poor guy trudged on alone each week.As a kid of 15, Night Stalker was the 70's version of X-Files and Buffy, only IMO it was MORE suspenseful than those two shows in this regards: Kolchak never carried a gun (like Mulder or Scully) nor did he have super powers (like Buffy), the dude was also middle-aged, in questionable shape, and was clumsy as hell. When he took on a monster all he had was his wits, maybe some homemade weapon, and his bungling courage. It's a miracle this guy wasn't turned into monster food in the first few episodes.This show may seem cheesy by today's standards but what it lacks in special effects it more than makes up for with terrific acting, not only by the inimitable McGavin himself, but by a great ensemble cast, and this to me was the main appeal of the show. You could almost feel the camaraderie of the cast.I'll admit that not all the episodes were great (some were even lame), but overall it was one of the most suspenseful shows of it's time, and IMO is STILL a great show.Sadly, as someone else here has noted, Darren McGavin passed on recently.

I love the ""Night Stalker"" and ""Night Strangler"" movies, and promptly shelled out the necessary bucks when I finally found this box set on the shelf. But the show is undeniably cheese.""Kolchak"" picks up where the ""Night Strangler"" movie left off, with intrepid investigative reporter (and forerunner of everyone from John McClane to Clarice Starling and Fox Mulder) Carl Kolchak battling demons, witches covens, Aztec cults, vampires, rippers, werewolves and headless bikers in the Windy City.Low production values inspire a few unexpected giggles; the amazingly bad makeup jobs in ""The Werewolf"" and ""Chopper"" are examples of talented filmmakers making the most of zero-dollar budgets. Still, I gotta admire the show's attempts to give Kolchak some imaginative monsters to defeat.Darren McGavin was (and still is) the reason to watch the show. He believes in these ghosts and goblins so passionately that we believe in them, too, no matter how shoddy the effects. This is one of the classic television performances, and Kolchak is truly an unforgettable character, right up there with Archie Bunker and George Costanza.The quality of these episodes ranges from poor to very good; my favorites are ""The Devil's Platform"" and ""The Vampire,"" which get high marks thanks to their writing. (""What is it that you hate about my hat?"" ""What's under it!""). And ""Chopper"" has a great supporting performance from Larry Linville of ""MASH."" (The episode itself is almost ruined by its rather comic headless head-chopper.)In the end, you either love ""Kolchak"" in spite of its cheap production values, or you don't. I do love ""Kolchak,"" and count this DVD set as a treasure in my collection. No, the episodes didn't cost a million dollars to produce, but there's no doubt that the charm, heart and humanity of the series survived the 1970s ... and the crypt of TV oblivion.",4,Classic cheese,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,1930,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'title', 'review', 'fool', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Kolchak', 'love', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'Night', 'Strangler', 'movies', 'promptly', 'shelled', 'out', 'necessary', 'bucks', 'when', 'finally', 'found', 'box', 'set', 'shelf', 'show', 'undeniably', 'cheese', 'Kolchak', 'up', 'where', 'Night', 'Strangler', 'movie', 'left', 'off', 'intrepid', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'forerunner', 'everyone', 'John', 'McClane', 'Clarice', 'Starling', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'Carl', 'Kolchak', 'battling', 'demons', 'witches', 'covens', 'Aztec', 'cults', 'vampires', 'rippers', 'werewolves', 'headless', 'bikers', 'Windy', 'City.Low', 'production', 'values', 'inspire', 'few', 'unexpected', 'giggles', 'amazingly', 'bad', 'makeup', 'jobs', 'Werewolf', 'Chopper', 'are', 'examples', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'making', 'most', 'zero-dollar', 'budgets', 'Still', 'got', 'ta', 'show', 'attempts', 'give', 'Kolchak', 'imaginative', 'monsters', 'defeat.Darren', 'McGavin', 'was', 'still', 'reason', 'watch', 'show', 'ghosts', 'goblins', 'so', 'passionately', 'believe', 'too', 'matter', 'how', 'effects', 'one', 'classic', 'television', 'performances', 'Kolchak', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'George', 'Costanza.The', 'quality', 'episodes', 'ranges', 'poor', 'very', 'good', 'favorites', 'are', 'Devil', 'Platform', 'Vampire', 'get', 'high', 'marks', 'thanks', 'writing', 'What', 'hate', 'hat', 'What', 'Chopper', 'great', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'MASH', 'episode', 'almost', 'ruined', 'rather', 'comic', 'headless', 'head-chopper', 'end', 'either', 'love', 'Kolchak', 'spite', 'cheap', 'production', 'values', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'love', 'Kolchak', 'count', 'DVD', 'set', 'treasure', 'collection', 'No', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'cost', 'million', 'dollars', 'produce', 'doubt', 'charm', 'heart', 'humanity', 'series', 'survived', '1970s', 'crypt', 'TV', 'oblivion']",N/A

He referred me to David Chase at Universal Studios, so I sent him a request as well (hand-written in pencil in my best cursive).  I received a gracious refusal, in which he thanked me for being a fan but informed me that at that time there were no plans for any books based on the show.  Unfortunately, I no longer have that letter, but I still have many fond memories of watching the series.Revisiting it as an adult, I was pleased at how well many of the episodes hold up.  Darren McGavin is great as the wise-acre reporter Kolchak and is the primary reason for the show's success, although Simon Oakland and Jack Grinnage must be recognized as well.  As sorry as I was to see it go, I now think that it is just as well that it ended when it did, as the quality of the writing definitely declined over the course of the season and the monster-of-the-week format became a bit preposterous.  However, before the ignominious end, in which Kolchak faced off against a man in a ridiculous reptile costume, there were a run of great episodes.  Standouts include ""The Ripper"" (Jack the Ripper!), ""The Zombie"" (self-explanatory!), and ""Horror in the Heights"" (an East Indian demon, scripted by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster).

If you have never seen this show, or only know of it because of it's influence on Chris Carter and the ""X Files"" do yourself a favor and pick this up immediately! For years ""Night Stalker"" was a great little secret that only a handful of people you talked to knew about. But almost everyone who has seen the show remembers it fondly. ""Night Stalker"" was so different from everything else put out on TV in the late 70's it transends the ""Charlie's Angels"" decade and still seems fresh and innovative today. It's a shame a quality show like ""Night Stalker"" couldn't survive in a TV world filled with ""Sheriff Lobo"" and ""Three's Company"" type crap. But maybe if it had survived it never would have reached the cult status it has obtained...who knows? This 3 disk set contains the entire series, and my only gripe is that you have to purchase the TV movies ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"" on a different DVD to get the complete Kolchak collection, it would have been nice to get everything in one box set. I would have been willing to fork over the extra bucks just to have everything in one package. I see some of the folks complaining about the transfer to DVD, and while it is apparent there has been little if any restoration done to the shows, I can't complain. The grainy, sometimes too dark, transfer actually enhances the show for me. I mean I grew up catching the odd repeat of ""Night Stalker"" late at night on UHF channels, the grainy feel lends itself well to this series, almost giving it a documentary feel at points which actually ups the creepiness level to some episodes. That said, the transfer is not bad. This is the best I have seen this show look.

933510,A2XSGVBHS37L2B,B000ATQYWY,"D. Mills ""WatchThis""","[1, 2]","This box set captures the 20 episodes of 'Kolchak: The Night Stalker' which aired on ABC-TV for a single season from 1974-75. The late Darren McGavin gave the Carl Kolchak character a unique charm, from the seersucker suit, to the porkpie hat. He was a reporter for a Chicago News Service who developed a knack for getting involved in stories that went out into the fringe - aliens, spirits conjured up by Hindu incantations, headless bikers, murderous mannequins that come to life, zombies and robots.This all sounds great, and as originally conceived, the series showed promise. The actual execution was plagued by problems, namely McGavin having less control than he expected, plus rushed and shoddy scripts that did not make the best of the sometimes creative conundrums that such a show can offer. By the middle of this single season, McGavin had become outspokenly negative about the whole production, and the quality of the shows took a noticeable dive. ABC put a stake in Night Stalker's heart by spring of 1975.Despite the problems, some of us have a warm spot in our heart for McGavin's character, and on those occasions when the scripts and production rose to the occasion, this could be a genuinely entertaining affair. Sadly, Universal has added nothing to this set that could have lifted it above a 3-star rating. There are no extras - promos, interviews, or anything that could have added to the set's historical value. Discs are two-sided, and it appears there was no remastering of the picture. It's by no means atrocious, just totally lacking in any sort of sparkle.Fans of this series can fork over for this - it's all we've got. If you are new to the whole Night Stalker franchise, skip this for the time being and pick up the MGM or Anchor Bay disc containing both TV specials (Night Stalker/Night Strangler). They were truly inspired, from the storytelling to the acting. Broadcast in early 1972 and 1973, they garnered extraordinary ratings and led to green-lighting the series we have in this box set.There is also a short-lived, but IMHO underrated, 'Night Stalker' revival series, aired in 2005. It was cancelled after a few shows, but the twin DVD collection is well worth a look. Although actor Stuart Townsend did not bring the same charm to his lead role as McGavin did, the storytelling was a notch above what we had in 1974-75. Director Frank Spotnitz was an X-Files veteran, and gave the series a conspiratorial bent, which coupled with dark production, was reasonably satisfying.

The show followed a rigid formula with certain plot elements you could count on every episode: bumbling reporter Carl Kolchak will run afoul of authorities, he will meet a number of eccentrics who help him gather clues, and he will somehow manage to come face-to-face with the terrifying menace at the end. Not every episode was great (The Werewolf, The Spanish Moss Murders, Horror in the Heights, and The Sentry are my favorites), but snappy writing and the great Darren McGavin as Kolchak make these worth checking out.

I saw all twenty episodes consecutively within a couple of days.Kolchak The Night Stalker, is a really crazy, 70s style, hour long TV program starring Darren McGavin, as Kolchak. Kolchak appears to be a total crack-pot, sensationalizing yellow journalist. But -- looks can be disceiving. He's not a crack-pot, he's not making this stuff up, and he's not a yellow journalist.NEVERTHELESS -- nobody believes him. Every week he single handedly dispenses with the ""monster-of-the-week"", and still nobody seems to believe him. Armed only with a camera, Kolchak bumbles into the occult, the unbeleivable and the unseen, all of which are very deadly, and without thanks, he saves us all --- every week -- twenty times in all. There are no tricks, no CGI, no gadgets or weapons in any conventional sense. Sometimes, in the course of his investigation, he stumbles onto secret weapons: like arrows blessed by the divine Brahma, wooden stakes or even words used to denounce the evil!THE DVD BOXED SET: There are NO extras or frills on the 3 double-sided disks, but for me, they played very well, and appear to have a clean, excellent transfer onto DVD. I have read here that some people had problems with the set not playing well. Mine did, but this type of double-sided DVD is prone to problems, and I have had them on other sets of this kind, and it can be very frustrating.--- SEEING THE GLASS [DVD SET] AS HALF-FULL RATHER THAN HALF-EMPTY --Nevertheless, though I would have loved extras; commentary, interviews, and maybe some relevant featurettes, it is really the quality of the transfer, and the restoration to full-length that makes this a must-have DVD set. Furthermore, there are virtually NO missing scenes. In recent years I have not dared to watch Kolchak for fear of realizing, ruefully, how many scenes were literally hacked-out so that the running time could be reduced by 6-9 minutes for commercials. I found myself trying to recall the missing scenes to the point of utter stress, and complete distraction. Now all that has changed for the better. Being able to see Kholchak, the way it was originally intended, fullfills most of what is expected from any DVD set by any fan, including me. Because this DVD set does accomplish those objectives, and it the cost is quite reasonable, I think of this set as a glass that is half-full rather than half-empty.I can't stress enough the value, that this DVD set has within it, despite its intrinsic shortcomings. Everything you need to enjoy the series, an excellent transfer, and each of the 20 episodes in their entirety [51 minutes + or -] is present.Naturally, if you have glitches on your set, which seems more likely when it is double-sided, you have every reason to be dismayed. Fortunately, Amazon itself, has a pretty liberal return policy in the event of such mishaps, and that, to some extent does mitigate the concern for us. In the meantime, I am really enjoying the series, and the knowledge that it is within easy reach whenever I wish to enjoy it.MY FAVORITE EPISODES: ""THE SPANISH MOSS MONSTER"", which is vintage semi-scary Kholchak at its best. ""HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS!"" with ""The Rakshasa"" as the classic supernatural, and unbelievable monster. In all episodes, the supporting cast is excellent, but in these two the combination of Kholchak ambience, and scary bedtime story texture, makes them the standouts for me.",5,KOLCHAK - THE NIGHT STALKER IS BACK!

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[11, 15]","Expect to see ""Night Stalker"" return this fall in a new form, produced by the ""X-Files'"" Frank Spotnitz and starring Stuart Townsend. But in all probability, it won't measure up to the original series of ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker,"" a witty short series that has gained cult appeal. At best, it will have its work cut out for it.In the mid-1970s, after a pair of hit TV movies called ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler, ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker"" debuted. It reintroduced us to Carl Kolchak, a threadbare reporter who is working in Chicago. He also has a tendency to bump into ghoulies, ghosties and things that go bump in the night.In this series, Kolchak encounters a harrowing series of problems: Kolchak battles bizarre aliens and ""missing link"" primates; a series killer may be Jack the Ripper;  a call girl returns from the dead; a malevolent doppelganger is causing people to burn to death; and voodoo zombies, haunted armor, succubi, werewolves, demons, killer robots, ghosts and gods.The supernatural is everyday on TV now, with several series (past and present) focusing on everything from A (animals) to Z (zombies). But ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker"" has the advantage of being the grandaddy of them all, with a fresh outlook and plots that owe nothing to anyone.While the horror parts can be a bit campy, the originality of its plotlines can't be denied. Sure, it mines everything from Aztec gods to voodoo. But it also comes up with plots that no legend could come up with, such as the idea of Helen of Troy still alive and beautiful, and sucking the youth from modern young men. It's brilliant.It also has what few supernatural series have: a sense of humour. There's that entire episode about a headless motorcycle driver -- a modern update of the ""Headless Horseman,"" maybe? And, of course, the brilliant twist of having diabolical help during a political campaign. Seriously, how could some of these politicians be elected otherwise?Not to mention the dialogue: we are informed by Kolchak that, ""Captain Leo Winwood and I had a relationship that was long and bloody, like the Crusades, only without the chivalry."" That's not the wittiest line of the series, either.Darren McGavin -- who twice played a similar character in ""The X-Files"" -- did an excellent job as Carl Kolchak. He plays Kolchak as a crusty, slightly crabby reporter -- an everyman for the supernatural. He's not handsome, not athletic, not charming, and he rubs the cops the wrong way. Therein lies his rough charm.Only time will tell how good the new series is. But one thing is undeniable: the original ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker"" remains a delicious cult classic.

933518,A3UHRZG3CS022C,B000ATQYWY,"frankbif ""frankbif""","[28, 30]","2006 UPDATE AND FINAL FOLLOWUP:This is a follow-up to my earlier review. I am going to try and give my thoughts on some of the problems -- some legit, some overstated (IMO) -- with regards to the DVD. I also wanted to give some additional commentary on the episodes themselves. I'll focus on the problems with the DVD quality first, since that is what has set off many people on this site and additional commentary on the episodes of ""Kolchak"" is secondary at this point.I've had a chance to watch all 20 episodes. It is imperative that once you get the DVD set that you watch all 20 shows as soon as possible (see #5 below).OK, let's get right to some of the major concerns some have had here with the DVD set:(1) The Transfer: You can see some grain when you use the zoom function on a DVD but it's not much worse than a SP-recorded VHS or other DVD's I've had made. The TV series transfer is not as good as the 2 telemovies (the Zoom feature shows the increased pixelation on the TV show). You can see some grain on them when you zoom or on a much larger TV. When you look at it normally, remember, ""Kolchak"" is film -- the speed of the frames is 24 frames per second (fps). Video transfers are 30 fps. For this reason, make sure that you have a quality DVD player that can handle 3:2 pulldowns and film-based DVD's. A quality DVD player will improve the playback of the DVD's.(2) Darkness: We have some experts on this here that talked about the specific transfer process and the problems with dark scenes and lack of light. I don't want to contradict them as they certainly know more than me on the technicals. Let me say this. Yes, the scenes are dark. But the show was shot predominantly at night (one of the reasons Darren McGavin tired of the series rather early) and some of the characters wear dark outfits. Someone commented that in the scene in ""The Ripper"" you wouldn't know what was happening if you hadn't seen the show before. This was the scene at night, with a black-caped Ripper fighting policemen (wearing dark blue uniforms) after he jumped from the building beams. YOU AREN'T GOING TO SEE THAT MUCH DETAIL in that scene. It's a scene shot in the dark with mediocre lighting with characters wearing dark clothes. I don't know if any transfer or digital cleanup would improve it that much. I've seen the episode on TV and it's not any better than the DVD. So I can't believe that the original broadcast or even any ""brightening, improved transfer"" would improve it. That said, I have a.....(3) Solution: If you have an HDTV or high-end TV, adjust the ""gamma"" control which distinguishes black levels. Adjusting the black levels -- or contrast levels on simpler sets -- will help improve the visibility during dark scenes. DVD's sometimes have different settings (Movie, Standard, Cinema, etc) -- play around with them. To compare and contrast, check out the labyrinth scenes in the movie ""The Rock"" -- if you can make out the water, people, and walls in the murky black, your TV and DVD are doing a good job and you probably won't be able to improve your blacks/gamma/contrast anymore for a DVD like ""Kolchak"".(4) DVD: If you can, utilize the progressive function on your DVD player. This requires use of component cables, not the standard red/white RCA jacks. The picture is noticeably smoother and improved over both composite and S-Video jacks.(5) Quality Control: If you can't watch all 20 episodes fairly quickly, I suggest you use medium fast-forward to see if the disks are all working properly. Best to view them all in normal PLAY back, but at a minimum, if you can't do that or are pressed against a return date deadline for exchange, play them back in a ""slow"" fast-forward mode that takes you a bit over an hour or two to watch all 20 episodes. Make sure the disks all work fine -- they may not release these on HDTV so these DVD's will be all she wrote for some time.Now for some more ""Kolchak"" fun-facts:(1) Length: All episodes are 50-plus minutes compared to recent showings on Sci-Fi of about 44-45. The first 10 episodes shown in 1974 are actually a minute longer (51 minutes and change) compared to the last half of the series (50 minutes and change) shown in 1975 -- ABC no doubt was trying to make up for the lousy ratings with an extra minute of commercials. Ah, the 1970's...when a 1-hour program only had 9-10 minutes of commercials!(2) It's great to see the 4 episodes that were butchered by stitching them together into 2 separate movies. I hated seeing the episodes that way -- Darren McGavin had to re-dub commentary to make it seem even halfway intelligible.(3) Funny Line from ""The Trevi Collection"": ""A small nominal contribution is requested...NOT THAT NOMINAL!""(4) Scenery: Look at that newsroom. It's how it was in the 1950's up through the 1970's. The show was shown in 1974 and the big teletypes were still the way the news media communicated with each other (besides phones). No internet, no cable news, no iPods, etc.(5) R.I.P.: Darren McGavin, Simon Oakland and Ruth McDevitt....god bless. Great actors and actress....wonderful acting....hilarious 1-liners.....they are sorely missed.Jack Grinnage? underrated and underused. His interactions with Darren McGavin are classic.(6) The Guest Stars: Wow, where to begin. Julie Adams (""Mr. R.I.N.G"") from ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954) Robert Cornwaite (""The Energy Eater"") from ""The Thing From Another World"" (1951), Lara Parker (""The Trevi Collection"") from ""Dark Shadows"", Jamie Farr (""Primal Scream"") from ""M.A.S.H."", Bernie Kopell (""The Trevi Collection"") from ""Get Smart"" and ""Love Boat"", Larry Linville (""Chopper"") from ""M.A.S.H."", Jim Backus (""Chopper"") from ""Mr. Magoo"" and ""Gilligans Island"", Sandra Gould (""Primal Scream"") from ""Bewitched"", Phil Silvers (""Horror in the Heights) from ""Sergeant Bilko"", Tom Skerritt (""Devils Pact"") from ""Aliens"", Kathie Brown (a/k/a Mrs. Darren McGavin) 1960's actress from ""Star Trek"" to ""Bonanza"" (Pernell Roberts love interest), Carolyn Jones (""Demon in Lace"") from ""The Addams Family"")Then you have the 1970's actors and actresses who seemed to show up in dramas like ""Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" or sitcoms every other week -- Nita Talbot, Dick Gautier, Barbara Rhoades -- the list goes on and on. There's a star and/or everyday actor or actress that you'll know visually from lots of other 1960's and 1970's appearances in virtually every ""Kolchak"" episode. Some you'll recognize right away. Others you'll be going back to IMDB.com . Try and get those cameos in today's TV series. You can't. Oh yeah,....David Chase from ""The Sopranos"" as a writer, too!Wow...what a series._______________________________________________________I normally wouldn't write a review before testing or buying the product, but as it was me who contacted Jack Grinnage, an original cast member from KOLCHAK, I wanted to give my thoughts.  Jack Grinnage is an original cast member from the TV series (not the movies) and we are lucky to have him post his thoughts.  I hope Jack will share more thoughts on the series and the DVD release once they are out, either here or on his website.  Thank you, Jack, you have alot of fans here.Now for the DVD's.  The best thing about the release is going to be the ability to see the shows uncut for the first time in 30 years.  Even CBS when they ran the show late-night in the early 1980's edited out some footage (minimal; they actually had the show run over an hour to minimize edit cuts and maximize commercials).  Seeing KOLCHAK uncut, even without expanded commentary (we can get alot of the behind-the-scenes stuff from the Internet, thankfully) is worth the price of the DVD's.  Regrettably, Darren McGavin is not in good health and is not included in the commentaries.  I wouldn't have minded seeing Jack Grinnage (""Ron Updyke"") or Carol Ann Susi (""Monique Marmelstein"") on the DVD commentaries, but what's done is done.Now to the key point.  As others have noted, these disks will be dual-sided, which means the opportunity for defects is increased.  They will also be made by Universal, which means the opportunity for defects is almost guaranteed.  If anybody from Universal is reading these posts, take it from the people who will be buying the disks:  we would rather pay a few bucks more for QUALITY DVD's that have been pre-screened for any defects, than get slip-shod quality and saving a few bucks.Unless Universal wants die-hard KOLCHAK fans returning these sets countless times to get a complete set of defect-free disks, get it right.  The folks who are buying these sets are die-hards who will not tolerate glaring imperfections.  If the DVD's were being purchased by ordinary collectors just interested in an obscure TV show, they might put up with it.  We won't.I really wish the DVD's were single-sided and had a nice KOLCHAK emblem on the non-playing side.  Would it cost more to produce with more features and doubling the disk quantity?  Sure -- but who here wouldn't pay it?  Universal should know that the people who buy this DVD are going to be the fans of the show, not folks casually strolling down the DVD aisles at Best Buy.  So why not tailor it to us, the fans who have clamored for the show for years?  I think I speak for many when I say we all would pay a few dollars more for higher quality, one-sided, added-commentary DVD's.  But again...what's done is done.Now that we know what Universal has decided to give us, please, just make sure the disks work and work right from the get-go.  It will ultimately save Universal and the retailers alot of money to get it right the first time -- and save loyal fans like us alot of aggravation.Here's to one of the best televison shows of all time, which first premiered on Friday the 13th of September, 1974.  Want a good scare?  Well, buy this DVD set...as Carl Kolchak himself said at the end of one of the episodes ""....IF YOU HAVE THE NERVE!!""10/22/05 POST-PURCHASE UPDATE:  Well, they screwed it up!It appears that our worst fears have been confirmed and the quality control on these DVD's appears to rival that of the American auto industry in the late 1970's.  Dual-sided disks, missing disks, glitches & freezing up -- it appears that better quality could have been obtained from having someone burn DVD's from the older Kolchak VHS tapes.  So it appears that all we are getting is a poor digital transfer of the series (thankfully, they appear uncut) with plenty of playback problems.The one bright spot might be to contact Universal -- write or email the corporate guys, not the Video Customer Service folks ! -- and tell them how dissapointed you are with their product and that in the future you will refrain from buying ANY Universal DVD sets given the lack of extras, poor production quality, etc.  Perhaps Universal will be prodded into producing a much-higher quality set of HD-DVD's in a few years when that format starts making the rounds.I will give a final update once I have seen all the episodes off of the DVDs (assuming they all play on my DVD player, that is).",5,"""Kolchak"":  Final Review, Q&A on DVD Problems,

933521,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000ATQYWY,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 2]","Today Darren McGavin (1922-2006) is best recalled as the grumpy father in the classic 1983 A CHRISTMAS STORY, but he was a hardworking character actor with a long list of credits, and in the 1970s he was likely best known for his role in the television KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER.  The series ran twenty episodes on ABC in 1974-1975 season, but according to television lore McGavin was already disenchanted with the writing by the time he filmed the second episode.  The series had a loyal following, but it wasn't a ratings winner, and ABC was not unhappy when Gavin asked to be released at the end of the season.The series arose from a then-unpublished novel and two made-for-television movies based on it, both starring McGavin as Kolchak, a Chicago newspaper reporter who seems to have a knack for getting involved in supernatural unpleasantnesses.  These include Jack the Ripper, zombies, space aliens, vampires, werewolfs, ghosts, a moss monster, and even the devil itself.  McGavin, it was said, felt the whole thing was basically a ""monster of the week"" show, and it is easy to see why he complained about the writing: there is lots and lots of filler and the stories don't often hang together in any consistent sort of way.  The episodes were designed to fit into an hour slot with commercials, so they generally run about fifty minutes per title.The big thing you should know about KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER is that it strove for a certain sense of humor that today reads as a mixture of cheesey and campy.  It's the sort of thing that is accidentally funny, unintentionally comic, and occasionally to the level of eye-rolling and head-shaking.  The characters are quick-sketch stereotypes, each with immediately identifiable glitches (Kolchak, for instance, always wear the same rumpled suit and ugly hat and drives a yellow convertable.)

I love it for the characters, and chief of these, of course, is Darren McGavin's title character, the intrepid and rumpled reporter, Carl Kolchak, who makes you laugh even when he's not trying to. Arguing with his boss, arguing with the police, bravely following monsters into old houses and sewers and what not. He never gives up. And all the time Kolchak insists that the public has the right to know if there is a monster among them.  Each episode ends with Kolchak speaking into his miniature tape recorder, warning anyone who might be willing to listen, such as: ""Try and tell yourself, it couldn't happen here.""  Just try!Before the TV series, there were two made-for TV movies, ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"". These aren't included with this TV series set; I have them combined on a separate single DVD. It looks the price of a new one has skyrocketed, so it must not be in production anymore. The first movie aired on ABC on January 11, 1972, and it was the highest rated TV movie up to that time. The sequel aired about a year later.The Night Stalker/The Night Strangler (Double Feature)Then, in 1974, we finally see the series, 20 weekly episodes were shot and aired.We fans couldn't understand why it was cancelled, but the facts are clear. Out of eighty-four series airing on TV during the 1974-75 season, ""Kolchak"" ratings finished in 74th place.  [""All in the Family"" was the top show that season.]If you'd like more background about the show, I recommend ""Night Stalking: A 20th Anniversary Kolchak Companion"", by Mark Dawidziak. Originally published in 1991, Dawidziak interviewed McGavin (who was also executive producer), Jeff Rice (creator, author of original books), Dan Curtis (producer) and Richard Matheson (screenwriter extraordinaire). In addition, he talked to directors, writers, composers, guest stars, and TV critics.For example, David Bianculli, TV critic for the New York Post, had this to say about episode #2, ""The Zombie"": ""More than fifteen years later, I still feel squeamish  thinking about Kolchak crawling through a car graveyard trying to pour salt into the zombie's mouth and then sewing its lips shut before it could wake up.

933534,A169CPBR76SEF1,B000ATQYWY,Ian K. Hughes,"[6, 16]","KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER, airing 1974-75, followed up on the success of two previously aired made for TV movies: ""The Night Stalker"" (1971) and ""The Night Strangler"" (1973). While this reviewer has seen neither movie (and therefore has to suspend judgment as to their quality), quite a few others have extended praise on their behalf. Be that as it may, as far as *this* complete DVD set is concerned, one really should make the attempt to critique through lenses free of nostalgic fog.Without question, the main virtue of this series ( now an ""oldie"" ) is located in the late Darren McGavin's dynamic portrayal of quirky Chicago reporter, Carl Kolchak and his encounters with various instances of strange ( and largely malevolent ) phenomenon. His humorous interplay with the cast regulars, especially Simon Oakland (Kolchak's grizzled boss, Tony Vincenzo ), redeemed a good deal of the outright silliness that passed for scary in 1975 ( I do, however, freely admit to being frightened as a 10 year old! ). Truly, McGavin's talent was well above the material provided through largely paltry scripts. Out of the 20 episodes featured, only four or five displayed any kind of consistent quality: ""The Vampire"", ""The Spanish Moss Murders"", ""Demon in Lace"", ""The Sentry"" and ( above all ) ""Horror in the Heights"". The rest run the gamut from fair to awful, enjoyable only if one is an inveterate collector of all things 70's, or perhaps taking a stroll down memory lane. If, however, one is looking for genuine thrills, it would undoubtedly pay to find the few worthy episodes in the local video shop.Final note: aside from Darren McGavin's acting, the only other substantial attribute KOLCHAK possesses is the interest of one of its fans, a fellow named Chris Carter. Apparently, Carter drew upon aspects of the Kolchak character while fashioning his landmark creation THE X FILES and its main protagonist, Fox Mulder. For this reason alone, KOLCHAK deserves a measure of respect.",2,a few gems in an otherwise silly series,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,1979,"['KOLCHAK', 'NIGHT', 'STALKER', 'airing', '1974-75', 'followed', 'up', 'success', 'two', 'previously', 'aired', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'Night', 'Stalker', '1971', 'Night', 'Strangler', '1973', 'reviewer', 'seen', 'neither', 'movie', 'therefore', 'suspend', 'judgment', 'quality', 'quite', 'few', 'others', 'have', 'extended', 'praise', 'behalf', 'Be', 'may', 'as', 'far', '*this*', 'complete', 'DVD', 'set', 'concerned', 'one', 'really', 'should', 'make', 'attempt', 'critique', 'lenses', 'free', 'nostalgic', 'fog.Without', 'question', 'main', 'virtue', 'series', 'now', 'oldie', 'located', 'late', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'dynamic', 'portrayal', 'quirky', 'Chicago', 'reporter', 'Carl', 'Kolchak', 'encounters', 'various', 'instances', 'strange', 'largely', 'malevolent', 'phenomenon', 'humorous', 'interplay', 'cast', 'regulars', 'especially', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'Kolchak', 'grizzled', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Vincenzo', 'redeemed', 'good', 'deal', 'outright', 'silliness', 'passed', 'scary', '1975', 'do', 'however', 'freely', 'admit', 'being', 'frightened', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Truly', 'McGavin', 'talent', 'was', 'well', 'material', 'provided', 'largely', 'paltry', 'scripts', '20', 'episodes', 'featured', 'only', 'four', 'five', 'displayed', 'kind', 'consistent', 'quality', 'Vampire', 'Spanish', 'Moss', 'Murders', 'Demon', 'Lace', 'Sentry', 'Horror', 'Heights', 'rest', 'run', 'gamut', 'fair', 'awful', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'one', 'inveterate', 'collector', 'things', '70', 'perhaps', 'taking', 'stroll', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'however', 'one', 'looking', 'genuine', 'thrills', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'pay', 'find', 'few', 'worthy', 'episodes', 'local', 'video', 'shop.Final', 'note', 'aside', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'acting', 'only', 'other', 'substantial', 'attribute', 'KOLCHAK', 'interest', 'one', 'fans', 'fellow', 'named', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'Apparently', 'Carter', 'drew', 'upon', 'aspects', 'Kolchak', 'character', 'fashioning', 'landmark', 'creation', 'THE', 'X', 'FILES', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'reason', 'alone', 'KOLCHAK', 'measure', 'respect']",N/A

But, just consider the DVD market today and forget about all that. Instead, rejoice! KOLCHAK:THE NIGHT STALKER hails from a time when TV shows could still be fun, and it was made by people who understand the real appeal of ""horror"" (i.e., how it can scare and entertain at the same time).Most of today's programs are bogged-down in their own pretensions and desire to be ""adult"" or ""gritty"". The people behind them forget that television is not reality. It's not supposed to be!

You can sense the terror that flows over him as he undertakes some foolishly dangerous action, but you know that the guy is driven by his principles.Rubber-suited monsters? There's nothing wrong with that. KOLCHAK  has HEART, and a real sense of fun ..... moreso than 99% of the current crop of CGI-saturated ""blockbusters."" In fact, the show allows you to dig back and remember what scared you when you were a kid. That's another thing in its favor.Despite a less-than-stellar remastering job, this DVD set is a must-have for fans of classic, imaginative, entertaining TV.

Now, today this show may seem a little hokey but back then it was really creepy.I was very pleased by the DVD set. The episodes are intact and I got to watch several that I've never seen before. It was also interesting to see how reporting used to be done... you had to get out from behind your big steel desk and go to the library or go to the morgue or find a subject matter expert. You had to develop photos and print them. You put stories ""on the wire"" so it could be picked up by news services via teletype. I don't think you could do the Night Stalker today. In this way it's as if it's preserved in amber.Sure, some of the special effects were hokey back then (I recall how incredibly unconvincing the headless biker was) but the stories made up for them.

So do my collections of Alfred Hitchcock and Columbo. DVD players are a dime a dozen these days. You could buy one for $20. But those cheap models just don't work that well. I know. I used to own one. When I first purchased the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD a few years back, I ended up taking it back to the store three times because I couldn't get it to play. I thought the discs were defective. What I later learned was that the cheap Apex DVD player I owned can't play all DVDs properly. After purchasing a new HD television last year, I also bought a higher-end Sony DVD player for about $80. The new DVD player has had no trouble playing Kolchak, Alfred Hitchcock, Columbo and Star Wars.I am 100 percent certain that at least 95 percent of those who have claimed foul on the Kolchak collection, as well as other DVD collections, are pointing their fingers at the wrong culprit.

933539,A3FHN6AIATT19K,B000ATQYWY,James Zinn,"[3, 5]","Note: I updated my original review and upgraded the rating as I finally watched more than the first few episodes so I have a more full picture of this release now.Originally I rated it one star but now have upped it to two.I used to like this TV show when it was originally broadcast when I was 12 years old.  But then again, I was only 12.Whether or not anyone likes the series doesn't matter; this is among the WORST DVD sets I have ever purchased.  This is NOT a quality DVD transfer.  It couldhave been done way better.The series itself was at times fun and campy but like the original ""Dark Shadows"" sloppy acting, writing and production come through.  Sometimes the actingis really bad and trying to make Hitchcock and Serling maneuvers poorly executed is just plain laughable.  Often when a monster attacks, a freeze frame occursthen you get a little audio, then the scene ends.  They must have been going for a 'G' rating but since it was broadcast originally past ""Prime Time"" at 10:00on Friday nights (then later changed to 8:00 as per wikipedia), it seems unnecessary.In fact the series had such low ratings and was so poorly executed, it didn't even last ONE full season before getting cancelled at 20 episodes when the main actor,Darrin McGavin quit.  He wasn't a bad actor but he wasn't the best, either.  He did have a likeable personality and does fit this role for what it is.Other reviewers have panned the video quality and I can only AGREE with them 100%.  I should have listened to them more before purchasing it, as I was influenced bya prevalence of glowing reviews from many more others.Not only this isn't any better than an amateur home video transfer from VHS tapes to a DVD, with graininess, at times the darkness of the video in night-time scenessucks all the enjoyment out of watching it.  Also at many times the video and audio are out of sync which is EXTREMELY ANNOYING!Now for the positives; it can be a fun campy series to watch but really isn't that great even for camp.  It can be just downright stupid sometimes, but thatcan be part of the fun.  McGavin was a good choice for this role.  There are many guest appearances by many supporting and B-grade actors/actresses seen in many moviesand series of the 1950s-80s, with a handful still alive and active.  Many you don't know by name seem familiar because most of these people made guest appearances inmany TV shows of the era.  It is fun to bring up some websites about movies & television and trace the histories of the guest actors while watching it.  But for someepisodes, that is the only real fun.  You can't help but to compare it to the series ""Love Boat"" for a similar experience with guest appearances.  In fact, a numberof the guest actors did appear on ""Love Boat"" as well!Overall, not highly recommended except to nostalgia buffs and fans of really weak campy horror flicks.",2,Not the greatest campy series; sloppy transfer to digital format,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,2876,"['Note', 'updated', 'original', 'review', 'upgraded', 'rating', 'finally', 'watched', 'more', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'so', 'have', 'more', 'full', 'picture', 'release', 'now.Originally', 'rated', 'one', 'star', 'now', 'have', 'upped', 'two.I', 'used', 'like', 'TV', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'when', 'was', '12', 'years', 'old', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'only', '12.Whether', 'not', 'anyone', 'series', ""n't"", 'matter', 'WORST', 'DVD', 'have', 'ever', 'purchased', 'NOT', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'couldhave', 'been', 'done', 'way', 'better.The', 'series', 'was', 'times', 'fun', 'campy', 'original', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'sloppy', 'acting', 'writing', 'production', 'come', 'Sometimes', 'actingis', 'really', 'bad', 'trying', 'make', 'Hitchcock', 'Serling', 'maneuvers', 'poorly', 'executed', 'just', 'plain', 'laughable', 'Often', 'when', 'monster', 'attacks', 'freeze', 'frame', 'occursthen', 'get', 'little', 'audio', 'then', 'scene', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'G', 'rating', 'was', 'broadcast', 'originally', 'Prime', 'Time', '10:00on', 'Friday', 'nights', 'then', 'later', 'changed', '8:00', 'wikipedia', 'unnecessary.In', 'fact', 'series', 'had', 'such', 'low', 'ratings', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'executed', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'last', 'ONE', 'full', 'season', 'getting', 'cancelled', '20', 'episodes', 'when', 'main', 'actor', 'Darrin', 'McGavin', 'quit', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'actor', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'either', 'did', 'have', 'likeable', 'personality', 'fit', 'role', 'what', 'is.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'panned', 'video', 'quality', 'can', 'only', 'AGREE', '100', '%', 'should', 'have', 'listened', 'more', 'purchasing', 'was', 'influenced', 'bya', 'prevalence', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'many', 'more', 'others.Not', 'only', ""n't"", 'better', 'amateur', 'home', 'video', 'transfer', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'DVD', 'graininess', 'times', 'darkness', 'video', 'night-time', 'scenessucks', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'Also', 'many', 'times', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'sync', 'EXTREMELY', 'ANNOYING', 'Now', 'positives', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'campy', 'series', 'watch', 'really', ""n't"", 'great', 'even', 'camp', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'downright', 'stupid', 'sometimes', 'thatcan', 'be', 'part', 'fun', 'McGavin', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'role', 'are', 'many', 'guest', 'appearances', 'many', 'supporting', 'B-grade', 'actors/actresses', 'seen', 'many', 'moviesand', 'series', '1950s-80s', 'handful', 'still', 'alive', 'active', 'Many', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'seem', 'familiar', 'most', 'people', 'made', 'guest', 'appearances', 'inmany', 'TV', 'shows', 'era', 'fun', 'bring', 'up', 'websites', 'movies', 'television', 'trace', 'histories', 'guest', 'actors', 'watching', 'someepisodes', 'only', 'real', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'series', 'Love', 'Boat', 'similar', 'experience', 'guest', 'appearances', 'fact', 'numberof', 'guest', 'actors', 'did', 'appear', 'Love', 'Boat', 'as', 'well', 'Overall', 'not', 'highly', 'recommended', 'nostalgia', 'buffs', 'fans', 'really', 'weak', 'campy', 'horror', 'flicks']",N/A

Huff ""Color Me Noir""","[0, 0]","This was a great occult/mystery series in the 1970's Darren McGavin's Karl Kolchak was an intrepid (And Irritating) reporter with a 'nose for news' and trouble! He always seemed to stumble across some of the most bizarre cases and annoy the police with his 'Fantastic' stories about everything from ghosts to witches to murderers who were several hundred years old. Throw in a few Gods, Demons and Indian legends come to life add a 'secret government project' gone awry and you get the general idea as to why he annoyed the authorities of the time who wanted to keep such things under wraps and out of the general public's knowledge. The only negatives were the 'Over The Top' performance of Lara Parker of 'Dark Shadows' fame as a black witch (similar to her Angelique role in 'Shadows) that seemed a little too campy and out of place on a show that took the occult theme somewhat seriously and the general lack of any 'real' research on any of the subjects presented. The show would have benefitted from a more 'scientific' approach - maybe a contact or researcher friend who had a background in general science who could help figure things out - you really couldn't believe Kolchak just stumbled onto the solution in every episode or was smart enough to figure it out every time.P.S. I also wanted to state that like some shows for ABC it started out as a couple of 'Television Specials' with the movies being 're-edited' into two episodes of the T.V. series.

Since it was a favorite TV of my teen-aged years I instantly invited myself over to watch a couple of episodes and when I got home I quickly made sure I disseminated a couple of hints to my sister that this would make a great Christmas present (she said the first hint was fairly obvious and the second was almost overkill).&#8220;Kolchak: The Night Stalker&#8221; is the complete series of the 1974 television series starring Darren McGavin. The premise of this TV series was that Carl Kolchak, a Chicago based reporter for the Independent News Service (INS) which seems to be on the lowest level of journalism that is either a reporters first or last job, INS seems to be Kolchak&#8217;s last chance. He inadvertently keeps running into supernatural explanations for murders that at first seem innocuous and ordinary until Kolchak starts to dig deeper into the story. Simon Oakland plays his overwrought boss Tony Vincenzo who wishes and tries to get Kolchak to get in the story he assigned him.In the course of his investigations Kolchak has run-ins with headless motorcyclists, a witches coven in the fashion industry, robots who have gained sentiency, American Indian Gods, lizard creatures living in the sewers and a werewolf on a cruise ship. &#8220;The Night Stalker&#8221; is also host to a who&#8217;s who of 70&#8217;s actors, Eric Estrada, Jamie Farr, Larry Storch, Dick Van Patten, Larry Linville, Antonio Fargas, Cathy Lee Crosby, Jim Backus and few others you&#8217;ll know on sight but not their names such as John Fiedler.&#8220;The Night Stalker&#8221; is famously noted as the inspiration behind Chris Carter&#8217;s &#8220;The X-Files&#8221; but you can also find ideas that would get a more fully played out in 80&#8217;s movies, disturbing Indian burial grounds (Poltergeist), a dead arsonist who possess people as they sleep (A Nightmare on Elm Street), cells from the Antarctic begin to grow when accidentally thawed (The Thing), although the producers did have a relationship with Richard Matheson who wrote the original story &#8220;The Thing&#8221; is based on.Some of the monsters look kind of campy, they did even in 1974, but the producers kept them in the dark, literally, low lighting to overcome the campiness of the creatures, but on DVD it only detrimentally affects two of the episodes. The one really element lacking is a special features side it would have been cool to have an interview with Darren McGavin or some of the others associated with the show. &#8220;Kolchak: The Night Stalker&#8221; was always fun to watch and light a child&#8217;s imagination and the stories still hold up today (despite low TV production values) and I found myself still being entertained.",4,Campy Horror Still Entertaining!,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,2886,"['didn', '8217', 'even', 'know', '8220', 'Night', 'Stalker', '8221', 'series', 'existed', 'DVD', 'went', 'dinner', 'friends', 'past', 'November', 'mentioned', 'had', 'was', 'favorite', 'TV', 'teen-aged', 'years', 'instantly', 'invited', 'watch', 'couple', 'episodes', 'when', 'got', 'home', 'quickly', 'made', 'sure', 'disseminated', 'couple', 'hints', 'sister', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'Christmas', 'present', 'said', 'first', 'hint', 'was', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'second', 'was', 'almost', 'overkill', '8220', 'Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker', '8221', 'complete', 'series', '1974', 'television', 'series', 'starring', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'premise', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'Carl', 'Kolchak', 'Chicago', 'based', 'reporter', 'Independent', 'News', 'Service', 'INS', 'be', 'lowest', 'level', 'journalism', 'reporters', 'first', 'last', 'job', 'INS', 'be', 'Kolchak', '8217', 's', 'last', 'chance', 'inadvertently', 'running', 'supernatural', 'explanations', 'murders', 'first', 'seem', 'innocuous', 'ordinary', 'Kolchak', 'dig', 'deeper', 'story', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'overwrought', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Vincenzo', 'who', 'tries', 'get', 'Kolchak', 'get', 'story', 'assigned', 'course', 'investigations', 'Kolchak', 'run-ins', 'headless', 'motorcyclists', 'witches', 'coven', 'fashion', 'industry', 'robots', 'who', 'have', 'gained', 'sentiency', 'American', 'Indian', 'Gods', 'lizard', 'creatures', 'living', 'sewers', 'werewolf', 'cruise', 'ship', '8220', 'Night', 'Stalker', '8221', 'also', 'host', 'who', '8217', 's', 'who', '70', '8217', 's', 'actors', 'Eric', 'Estrada', 'Jamie', 'Farr', 'Larry', 'Storch', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Patten', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'Antonio', 'Fargas', 'Cathy', 'Lee', 'Crosby', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'few', 'others', '8217', 'know', 'sight', 'not', 'names', 'such', 'John', 'Fiedler.', '8220', 'Night', 'Stalker', '8221', 'famously', 'noted', 'inspiration', 'Chris', 'Carter', '8217', '8220', 'X-Files', '8221', 'can', 'also', 'find', 'ideas', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'fully', 'played', 'out', '80', '8217', 's', 'movies', 'disturbing', 'Indian', 'burial', 'grounds', 'Poltergeist', 'dead', 'arsonist', 'who', 'possess', 'people', 'sleep', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'cells', 'Antarctic', 'begin', 'grow', 'when', 'accidentally', 'thawed', 'Thing', 'producers', 'did', 'have', 'relationship', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', 'story', '8220', 'Thing', '8221', 'based', 'on.Some', 'monsters', 'look', 'kind', 'campy', 'did', 'even', '1974', 'producers', 'kept', 'dark', 'literally', 'low', 'lighting', 'overcome', 'campiness', 'creatures', 'DVD', 'only', 'detrimentally', 'two', 'episodes', 'one', 'really', 'element', 'lacking', 'special', 'features', 'side', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'have', 'interview', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'others', 'associated', 'show', '8220', 'Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker', '8221', 'was', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'light', 'child', '8217', 'imagination', 'stories', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'today', 'low', 'TV', 'production', 'values', 'found', 'still', 'being', 'entertained']",N/A
933562,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,B000ATQYWY,Kendal B. Hunter,"[1, 1]","There is a good reason why ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" is a cult classic.  It has an offbeat character--Kolchak the washed up reporter whose bliss calls him to places where angels fear to tread, and devils often do. Then there is the  offbeat premise--the world is not as it seems, filled with witches, warlocks, and werewolves--and no one seems to care or wants to believe.  Then the offbeat setting--be the INS office or the odd locals where mystery becomes Kolchak.  This is the series strength--the world is almost 1974, with a persistent undercurrent of Macbeth.  Yes, all of the elements are there.As a character, Kolchak's charm is beyond measure.  Aside from his quirky wardrobe, we first notice that he is a trickster.  That is, he is a fast talking Anasi, Hare, Br'er Rabbit, and Bugs Bunny rolled into one.  Second, unlike Superman, Kolchak is, in G. K Chesterton's words, quite ""eatable"" (Orthodoxy, Ch. 8).  ""In a thrilling novel (that purely Christian product) the hero is not eaten by cannibals; but it is essential to the existence of the thrill that he *might* be eaten by cannibals.""Lastly, Kolchak is the essential underdog.  He is straightjacketed between editor Vincenzo, and the flux of police detectives, both who never let him win.  In this respect we are all Kolchak, and we follow his example of ""Rage against the machine"" and ""Illegitimi non carborundum.""However, the technical aspects of the DVD do not live up to the series' standards.  Although the menus are nice, the Universal logo and fanfare keep popping up--OK, we just need to see it once, and we get the idea. On a scale of 5, the transfer is about a 2.  This was a jolt, since the TV movie DVD was a 5+. Lastly, like the TV movie disc, these DVDs are the double-sided ABOMINATION! No!  No!  No!  Since they are so awkward to handle, I would much prefer more discs at a higher price than the accursed double sided discs at a cheaper price.  Kolchak is a series we will watch every October, so the discs must be built to last.The series does have its has flaws.  It focuses on characterization and setting (Kolchak in a weird world), but not on theme.  There is no cohesion to the episodes, just a steady stream of odd events.  The ""Twilight Zone"" was a consistent exploration of cosmic justice.  In this area, the revival series NuKolchak, was better with the wrist tattoos; we had a sense that the series was going somewhere.  With the original series, we get into a rut of Kolchak's glib Cassandra caterwauling  and random acts of malevolence.  So when the series finally ended, we were a bit relieved.Favorite episodes:""The Zombie"" The premise is similar to ""Live and Let Die,"" but the conflict between the pimp, the Mafiosi, and Kolchak, and the dialogue during the phone call leave you laughing.""The Vampire.""  This episode builds upon the events in the first TV movie, so it is a deeper, and does answer some of the questions we had from the first film.""The Werewolf."" Placing this episode on a swinging singles cruise was a stroke of genius, the actor who played the werewolf was perfectly cast, and when Kolchak's cabin mate dies, you knew that this episode was serious.  Love the 1970's fashions.""Horror in the Heights."" Guest starring Phil Silvers.  The mysterious set up--swastikas in a Jewish neighborhood--gets you from the first gammadion.  This episode should be the baptism of fire of Kolchak uninitiates.""The Trevi Collection.""  Newbies should see this after ""Horror in the Heights.""  If Ghostbusters was darker, I imagine that it would feel like this episode.  It is a nice mixture of everyday 1974 and the undercurrent of Macbeth.  It has nice plot-twists, a well-cast warlock, and the ending cosmic justice are all refreshing.""Mr. RING"" has the best set-up. The opening narration leaves you wondering, and you see a taproot to the X-files.""They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be.""  You see an early reference to the MIB in a black limo.""Legacy of Terror"" is notable for two cameos--Eric Estrada and Boss Hogg.  And watching the dangling recorder in the stairwell is vintage Kolchak.""The Knightly Murders"".  Being the first episode where Vincenzo questions Kolchak's sanity, this does not jibe with the events in ""The Night Strangler,"" where Kolchak persuades Vincenzo to ""Believe.""""The Sentry"" The plot is too close to Star Trek's ""Devil in the Dark"" (the Horta) for my taste. But the skeptical female cop grinding against Kolchak changed the dynamics (and chemistry) of the series.  In this sense, this episode is the last of  Kolchak, and the first of X-files.""The Chopper."" This is generally considered the worst of the series. I see two flaws. Fist, although the funeral scene is vintage Robert Zemeckis, it goes on too long. Second, the special effects leave much to be desired.  Being filmed 3 years before Star Wars, we see why Lucas could not film episodes I-III at that point in time.  Guest stars include Larry Linvel (Frank Burns) who played the surgeon in the first TV Movie, and a comb-over Jim Backus.",5,X-Files: Season 0--The Beginning!,1171756800,"02 18,

Sure, the series lasted only one season and was high camp at times, but it was Darren McGavin's strong acting who brought the character of fearless and intrepid reporter Karl Kolchak to life. McGavin also co-produced this exciting series.Although it deals with man-killing monsters and creatures in each episode, the emphasis here is on titillating the audience--not to terrify them. ""Kolchak"" works because the writers (ex-Twilight Zone alumnus Richard Matheson)and directors like David Chase who chose to keep the monsters in the shadows, and preferred suggestive horror to the explicit stuff we have grown accustomed to with today's typical slice-and-dice horror films.Added to this was McGavin as a completely credible, eccentric, and  down-at-the-heels newshawk with his tape recorder and Kodak Instamatic at the ready, narrating events as they occur while lending a feel of authenticity as his story unfolds.Light humor also took some of the edge off the scarier bits in this highly entertaining series. Supporting roles featured veteran actor, Simon Oakland, as Kolchak's annoying and demanding boss in a role well-suited to his character.The pilot for the series, ""The Night Stalker"" is a tour de force about a vampire running loose in Las Vegas--a most appropriate setting for a vampire film when you think about it--a city that lives by night.  The episodes that would follow featured Jack the Ripper, zombies, werewolves, rampaging robots, and a headless ""horseman"" who rides a motorcycle rather than a horse! This DVD set is nicely packaged and the transfers are adequate; despite these being Universal double sided discs, I experienced no skipping or freezing with my purchase.Sadly, the series went unnoticed without a review in TV Guide, and once ABC's new programming boss, Fred Silverman (who disliked sci-fi and fantasy shows) took over the reins of the network, Kolchak was pulled from his beat permanently.",5,"Camp, but oh so much fun to watch.....",1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,1989,"['Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'one', 'life', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'Sure', 'series', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'was', 'high', 'camp', 'times', 'was', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'strong', 'acting', 'who', 'brought', 'character', 'fearless', 'intrepid', 'reporter', 'Karl', 'Kolchak', 'life', 'McGavin', 'also', 'co-produced', 'exciting', 'series.Although', 'man-killing', 'monsters', 'creatures', 'episode', 'emphasis', 'here', 'titillating', 'audience', 'not', 'terrify', 'Kolchak', 'writers', 'ex-Twilight', 'Zone', 'alumnus', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'directors', 'David', 'Chase', 'who', 'chose', 'keep', 'monsters', 'shadows', 'preferred', 'suggestive', 'horror', 'explicit', 'stuff', 'have', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'today', 'typical', 'slice-and-dice', 'horror', 'films.Added', 'was', 'McGavin', 'completely', 'credible', 'eccentric', 'down-at-the-heels', 'newshawk', 'tape', 'recorder', 'Kodak', 'Instamatic', 'ready', 'narrating', 'events', 'occur', 'lending', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'story', 'unfolds.Light', 'humor', 'also', 'took', 'edge', 'scarier', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'series', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'featured', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'Kolchak', 'annoying', 'demanding', 'boss', 'role', 'well-suited', 'character.The', 'pilot', 'series', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'tour', 'force', 'vampire', 'running', 'loose', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'most', 'appropriate', 'setting', 'vampire', 'film', 'when', 'think', 'city', 'night', 'episodes', 'would', 'follow', 'featured', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'zombies', 'werewolves', 'rampaging', 'robots', 'headless', 'horseman', 'who', 'motorcycle', 'rather', 'horse', 'DVD', 'set', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'transfers', 'are', 'adequate', 'being', 'Universal', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'experienced', 'skipping', 'freezing', 'purchase.Sadly', 'series', 'went', 'unnoticed', 'review', 'TV', 'Guide', 'once', 'ABC', 'new', 'programming', 'boss', 'Fred', 'Silverman', 'who', 'disliked', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'shows', 'took', 'over', 'reins', 'network', 'Kolchak', 'was', 'pulled', 'beat', 'permanently']",N/A
933564,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000ATQYWY,Kevin J. Loria,"[1, 2]","Chris Carter, creator of the X-Files, admitted his inspiration for the series to be the 70's network series Kolchak: The Night Stalker.  The series a  spin-off of two successful made-for-tv-movies about a newspaper reporter learning the hard way that the truth ""is"" out there, a truth invariably dismissed week after week by his short-fused editor.  Carl Kolchak, played by Darren McGavin, now best known for ""the Christmas Story"" dad, gruffly pursues his stories no matter what supernatural path they might lead him down. Whether it be Aztec cults, Moss-monsters, Witches, Demons, headless motorcyclists, or the series' staples: Vampires. Kolchak fights them all. Sometimes Kolchak seems a far cry from heroic, at times almost cowardly, but we always admire his tenacity.  One thing the short-lived series shares with the reinvented version, currently on TV, is the interesting peripheral characters who serve as Kolchak's allies and sources, like ""Gourdy the Ghoul"" (played by an actor who Odd Couple & Pooh Bear aficionados might recognize) one of the only pre-CSI forensics characters who doesn't eat lunch over the bodies.

No big deal, turn the disc over and put it back in to get four more episodes.------------------------------------------This set is exactly what it seems to be.  It is the TV show in what appears to be its original form.  So that means it is not some restored 1080p rendition.  It is sized like it showed on TV as a square picture and so does not fill a full LCD monitor.  It appears just like when you first saw it many years ago.  So far I have had no issues playing any of the episodes.  Picture it good (as described) and sound is clear.  As you may recall this series was a cheaply done science fiction/fantasy series complete with the low budget special effects and the occasional low lighting scene.  But this was not a disappointment for me at all, it was great to hear his voice one more.I would also note that the discs look like they are ""PRINT ON DEMAND"" discs.  They came to me with no labels on them.  They were brand spank'n new in perfect condition as the packaging has each disc (three) in separate thin case holders which seat each disc firmly.  So there is no fear of scratched discs from bouncing in shipping as seems to be common today with some publishers and distributors and failed packaging attempts.  It may make it hard to know which disc you have if you mix them up but you can always put your own label on them if you really need to.",5,Update: Looks like the original redition of the low budget series.

A guy discovers an inexplicable threat to mankind.  Traditional law enforcement does not believe the guy.  Guy takes on the threat and defeats it.  Guy arrested or threatened with trumped up criminal charges if he ever speaks of word of what happened. Much like many of Stephen King's characters or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Kolchak is a person who unwittingly seems to attract evil forces.The element of this series that made the show so special was Darren (A Christmas Story) McGavin.  McGavin's portrayal of Kolchak, attired in beat up suit more appropriate for the tropics, was so unbelievable that it was perfect.  It is difficult to imagine anyone else playing the part.  McGavin is Kolchak.Carl Kolchak is a reporter who has seen more successful days as a crime reporter.  Despite career setbacks, he ignores traditional reporting, income, and a normal life to pursue bizarre stories.  Kolchak works for Independent News Service, INS, in Chicago.  If Kolchak's attire is out of place, so is the antiquated newsroom of INS.  It looks more like something out of the 1940s where Edward G. Robinson would be very much at home. Even Lou Grant faired better when he returned to the newspaper business.KOLCHAK - THE NIGHT STALKER television series followed two very successfull television movies.  The first, THE NIGHT STALKER, aired in 1972 and enjoyed a record breaking viewing audience.  The sequel, THE NIGHT STRANGLER, followed a year later.  A third installment, THE NIGHT KILLERS, was scrapped in favor of the television series.Unfortunately the weekly series failed to sustain a following on network television.  As a yearly television installment, Kolchak was a much anticipated movie of the week.  As a regular series the novelty wore out too quickly for all but die-hard NIGHT STALKER fans.  It was also said that Darren McGavin tired of character and opted out of the series.  The show disappeared.Since that time the television movies resurfaced on VHS.  Some time later a couple episodes were paired for video release.  It is about time that all 20 episodes have finally become available on DVD.There are areas of opportunity for this DVD release.  The DVD transfer unfortunately leaves many of the scenes too dark.  Granted, much of Night Stalker takes place at night, but it would be nice to see what is going on.  Next is that I miss couple seconds of old-fashioned Universal logo and music at the conclusion of each episode.  Finally, this release begs for special features.  Simply put: There are none.The KOLCHAK series is very affordable and worth adding to your television series collection.",4,Too Much of a Good Thing,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,2749,"['KOLCHAK', 'NIGHT', 'STALKER', 'was', '1974', '1975', 'X-Files', 'day', 'many', 'ways', 'basic', 'plot', 'formula', 'been', 'decades', 'guy', 'inexplicable', 'threat', 'mankind', 'Traditional', 'law', 'enforcement', 'not', 'believe', 'guy', 'Guy', 'threat', 'Guy', 'arrested', 'threatened', 'trumped', 'up', 'criminal', 'charges', 'ever', 'word', 'what', 'happened', 'Much', 'many', 'Stephen', 'King', 'characters', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Kolchak', 'person', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'attract', 'evil', 'forces.The', 'element', 'series', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'special', 'was', 'Darren', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'McGavin', 'McGavin', 'portrayal', 'Kolchak', 'attired', 'beat', 'up', 'suit', 'more', 'appropriate', 'tropics', 'was', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'was', 'perfect', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'part', 'McGavin', 'Kolchak.Carl', 'Kolchak', 'reporter', 'who', 'seen', 'more', 'successful', 'days', 'crime', 'reporter', 'career', 'setbacks', 'traditional', 'reporting', 'income', 'normal', 'life', 'pursue', 'bizarre', 'stories', 'Kolchak', 'Independent', 'News', 'Service', 'INS', 'Chicago', 'Kolchak', 'attire', 'place', 'so', 'antiquated', 'newsroom', 'INS', 'more', 'something', '1940s', 'where', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'home', 'Even', 'Lou', 'Grant', 'faired', 'better', 'when', 'returned', 'newspaper', 'business.KOLCHAK', 'NIGHT', 'STALKER', 'television', 'series', 'followed', 'two', 'very', 'successfull', 'television', 'movies', 'first', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'STALKER', 'aired', '1972', 'enjoyed', 'record', 'breaking', 'viewing', 'audience', 'sequel', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'STRANGLER', 'followed', 'year', 'later', 'third', 'installment', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'KILLERS', 'was', 'scrapped', 'favor', 'television', 'series.Unfortunately', 'weekly', 'series', 'failed', 'sustain', 'following', 'network', 'television', 'yearly', 'television', 'installment', 'Kolchak', 'was', 'much', 'anticipated', 'movie', 'week', 'regular', 'series', 'novelty', 'wore', 'out', 'too', 'quickly', 'die-hard', 'NIGHT', 'STALKER', 'fans', 'was', 'also', 'said', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'tired', 'character', 'opted', 'series', 'show', 'disappeared.Since', 'time', 'television', 'movies', 'resurfaced', 'VHS', 'time', 'later', 'couple', 'episodes', 'were', 'paired', 'video', 'release', 'time', '20', 'episodes', 'have', 'finally', 'become', 'available', 'DVD.There', 'are', 'areas', 'opportunity', 'DVD', 'release', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'scenes', 'too', 'dark', 'Granted', 'much', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'place', 'night', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'Next', 'miss', 'couple', 'seconds', 'old-fashioned', 'Universal', 'logo', 'music', 'conclusion', 'episode', 'Finally', 'release', 'begs', 'special', 'features', 'Simply', 'put', 'are', 'none.The', 'KOLCHAK', 'series', 'very', 'affordable', 'worth', 'adding', 'television', 'series', 'collection']",N/A

I adore every episode!That being said, UNIVERSAL MAKES SUCKY DVD SETS!! I hope they read this!! I bought a Columbo Season 3 set that was defective and unwatchable THREE TIMES OUT OF THREE!! I have read countless reviews of UNIVERSAL sets that were messed-up! They put the DVD's back to back and in the manufacturing process the DVD's get defects, mainly in the center of the DVD and they freeze up or, in my case three times, just won't even play!!I bought these all on VHS a year ago off Ebay brand new still in the plastic from Columbia House. Until I read PLEEEENNNTY of good reviews about this DVD, I don't plan on even coming close to buying it. Universal has burned me enough!!But, Kolchak fans, let's at least rejoice someone is putting this gem of a TV series on DVD, at least they're trying! Let's see if they produce!My favorite episodes while we're at it:Legacy of Terror: Aztec mummy and a cult of ancient Aztec worshippers. Great episode.

I wanted to make a note regarding something I discovered when watching the two original movies that aired prior to the show becoming a series. I watched the T.V. series back when it first aired in the 70's, but I did not have any recollection of the two made for T.V. movies that started the series. Either I never saw them as a kid or I just couldn't recall them. Anyway, I own and have viewed the two movies as an adult and they are excellent. The whole time I viewed the two movies I kept thinking,""something is missing?"" I figured out what is missing is the excellent score by Gil Melle'. In the series this score opens the credit of the show, but is also interspursed through out the show. It is one of the things that really makes the show. I wish they could take the two original movies and add this fantastic score. Everything others have mentioned are what make this a great program: the Micky Spellane, Sam Spade, narration by Kolchak during the show, the humor, the truly eerie moments, did I mention atmosphere!, the writing was really smart also. The photography was also excellent, check out the opening scene of ""The Spanish Moss Murders,"" you are right in the front seat of the car with Kolchak cruising thru the city.

933583,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000ATQYWY,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 2]","Darren McGavin stars as the irrepressible Carl Kolchak, fearless reporter for Chicago's Independent News Service. Ever dressed in seersucker suits and a porkpie hat with a camera and tape recorder slung over his shoulder, Carl shows up everywhere that news is happening, much to the chagrin of the local authorities. Kolchak has a knack for finding the story behind the story, and that story usually has something wrong with it; something that makes it unfit for printing and often puts Kolchak in some very uncomfortable situations. He's faced vampires, werewolves, witches, mummies, zombies, immortals, and more, but his biggest adversaries tend to be the people in charge who keep his stories from getting out to the public.If you haven't seen the 1974/75 television series ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"", you've really been missing out, especially you ""X-Files"" fans, as this is the show that inspired that whole search for the truth. After two hit TV movies in '72 and '73 (available on a double-feature DVD), Kolchak returned with these weekly adventures that spanned 20 episodes of witty tales of the macabre, pitting Kolchak against a cavalcade of monsters that varied from frightening to ridiculous. As a kid, the Alligator creature from the Sentry episode scared me I think, but today it looks rather like a High School football mascot costume, ha. The show featured guest stars galore, including the lovely Lara Parker of Dark Shadows fame back as a witch whose fits of laughter seem more than a bit excessive. In this DVD set you'll find all 20 episodes with varying picture quality, though it's decent throughout. There are only three discs holding the twenty 44 minute episodes though, meaning they are double-sided (so ya gotta be extra careful with 'em) and a lot of sets have had issues. I had to do a return myself in order to get one in which all the episodes played properly. I bought my younger sister, the X-Files fanatic, a set too, and she didn't have any troubles, thankfully. There are no bonus features, but at least you'll have the whole show with this set. The episodes are as follows:1. The Ripper: Yep, Jack the Ripper seems to be back alive and in Chicago!2. The Zombie: A dead man returns for revenge on those who laid him out!3. They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be...: This is the alien episode. You can really see how X-Files got inspiration from this one!4. The Vampire: A victim of the first Kolchak TV movie's vampire has returned as the living dead and is now stalking Hollywood!5. The Werewolf: On a cruise ship, Kolchak runs into a werewolf who enjoys tossing people around.6. Firefall: If you've ever been curious about dopplegangers (my friend's wife is sure she is being plagued by one), this episode is for you. And there's spontaneous human combustion no less!7. The Devil's Platform: Tom Skerritt plays a devil-dealing politician to perfection!8. Bad Medicine: A Native American demon is robbing high-rises of priceless jewels!9. The Spanish Moss Murders: A Cajun boogeyman is killing people in Chicago, but is it just a dream?10. The Energy Eater: A Native American Bear God is taking people out for building on his territory.11. Horror in the Heights: A Hindu demon begins attacking the elderly in a neglected part of town.12. Mr. R.I.N.G.: Artificial Intelligence turns deadly!13. Primal Scream: Kolchak goes up against a man-eating ape-man grown out of Antarctic cell samples.14. The Trevi Collection: The fashion industry is plagued by murders that could only be the work of a model witch.15. Chopper: When a motorcycle gang member returns from the grave, Kolchak is the only one who cares, as usual.16. Demon in Lace: A succubus plagues a college campus and causes young men to drop dead.17. Legacy of Terror: An Aztec cult begins making sacrifices at a fancy hotel, and the final sacrifice will require a mummy's participation.18. The Knightly Murders: The Black Knight attacks!19. The Youth Killer: Who knew Helen of Troy was such a terrible person? She's alive and well, and running a very deadly dating service in Chicago.20. The Sentry: A reptilian creature is tearing apart the workers in an underground facility, and Kolchak is the only one who can stop it!I used to watch Kolchak reruns late Friday nights on CBS in the '80's as a kid, and I LOVED 'em. Three I have always remembered in particular were the Zombie, werewolf, and alligator-man episodes. I think they just showed them more often or something. They used to give me quite a thrill, and they still do, though it's more because of the smart dialogue and delightful characters nowadays, not to mention the great nostalgic aspect. Though the overall quality of the DVD set varies, I highly recommend it to Kolchak fans and those curious about this awesome show! Trust me, if you've only seen the recent revival series, you ain't seen Kolchak. If I can ever break into the biz and afford to do it, I'd like to do some new Kolchak films and do them right! For now though, there's this set, there's the TV movie double feature DVD, and also some books available on the subject. Don't bother with the short-lived revival series that was trying more to be ""The X-Files"" than ""The Night Stalker"". I also highly recommend the recent Kolchak comic books and graphic novels from Moonstone.

With this scenario, you will always notice your hero, good guys wear white.Before I go into my meager review, I will agree with the people who have aforementioned the horrible quality of the print.  In certain episodes, you can hardly notice what the heck is happening on the screen, but then again, maybe its scratchiness gives it a nostalghic feel.Now about the series:In a few words I can sum it up and those few words would state ""it is horrible.""  When I was young, it was a treat to stay up and watch the Night Stalker on Friday (or was that Saturday) night as a rerun.  As a kid, I was generally somewhat scared and thought un-natural things were happening.  Now as an adult who was so looking forward to reliving a part of my youth...........as they say, some things are better left in the past.This series is horrible.  There is not a redeeming quality I can find and give a thumbs up to.  Horrible acting, horrible plots, horrible ideas, horrible everything.  Are you people watching the same series I just did?  I never fast forward even the worse rot, but I had to forward one episode to end my sheer boredom. Is it not amazing that the same blockhead (Kolchak) would constantly run into the same ""supernatural"" threat every episode, even when he is one the Queen Mary!  You can predict what will happen after the first  five minutes on ANY episode, there is no suspense, no twists, nothing to keep the viewer interested.I now will assume that each reviewer giving this series a rave review is some sci-fi geek who will not be truthful that this piece of garbage is now laughable.

It's enough to make you paranoid about buying anything.After reading all the negative reviews about the transfer quality, I, too, was very apprehensive about buying this. I'm glad I chose to ignore the warnings. Other than the show's opening segment and ""The Ripper"" episode, (which does display specks, debris, and a somewhat dark image), I see nothing, repeat, NOTHING wrong with the transfer quality on any other episode. I've even heard people complain about the graininess of images in night scenes. Hello! Do you know anything about photography?! Low light conditions = graininess, especially if shot with a high shutter speed and especially for something shot over 30 years ago. That's a fact. Images are sharp, crisp, fleshtones are accurate, and sound quality is good. It's the best I've seen these episodes look, even after comparing to what I've seen air on Sci Fi. Yes, there should have been more extras, and I'm deducting a star for that, but do not be scared off by the idiots on Amazon who complain about poor image quality because they don't know how to calibrate their equipment or they can't understand why their DVDs skip on their priceless $25 Coby DVD players.",4,Get over it people!,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,1311,"['Ever', 'phrase', 'little', 'knowledge', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'what', ""'ll"", 'get', 'read', 'too', 'many', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'enough', 'make', 'paranoid', 'buying', 'anything.After', 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'transfer', 'quality', 'too', 'was', 'very', 'apprehensive', 'buying', ""'m"", 'glad', 'chose', 'ignore', 'warnings', 'Other', 'show', 'opening', 'segment', 'Ripper', 'episode', 'display', 'specks', 'debris', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'image', 'see', 'nothing', 'repeat', 'NOTHING', 'wrong', 'transfer', 'quality', 'other', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'even', 'heard', 'people', 'complain', 'graininess', 'images', 'night', 'scenes', 'Hello', 'Do', 'know', 'anything', 'photography', 'Low', 'light', 'conditions', '=', 'graininess', 'especially', 'shot', 'high', 'shutter', 'speed', 'especially', 'something', 'shot', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'fact', 'Images', 'are', 'sharp', 'crisp', 'fleshtones', 'are', 'accurate', 'sound', 'quality', 'good', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'look', 'even', 'comparing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'air', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Yes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'extras', ""'m"", 'deducting', 'star', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'off', 'idiots', 'Amazon', 'who', 'complain', 'poor', 'image', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'calibrate', 'equipment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'DVDs', 'skip', 'priceless', '25', 'Coby', 'DVD', 'players']",N/A

933590,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,B000ATQYWY,Phillip Oliver,"[27, 28]","""The Night Stalker"" lasted only one season (from 1974-1975) but despite the cheesy special effects and make-up, it is still very entertaining. Sometimes creepy, sometimes funny, the series usually provides a good combination of chills and laughs. Like most series, it sometimes suffers from poor episodes but for every bad episode like ""Mr. R.I.N.G,"" you have a very good one like ""The Ripper."" My personal favorite episodes are ""The Ripper,"" ""The Vampire,"" ""Horror In The Heights,"" ""The Zombie,"" and ""The Spanish Moss Murders.""One of the elements that makes the series so memorable are the actors. Darren McGavin stars as the bumbling seersucker suit and straw hat wearing reporter Carl Kolchak, Simon Oakland as his shrill and hilarious boss and the delightful Ruth McDevitt as co-worker Miss Emily. It is hard to see where the inspiration came from for the new ""Night Stalker"" series which stars a deadpan Stuart Townsend, who seems to be channeling the zombies instead of Darren McGavin.Some of the guest stars include Keenan Wynn, Mary Wickes, Carolyn Jones, Lara Parker, Nina Foch, Phil Silvers, Tom Skerritt, Tom Bosley, Alice Ghostley and Jim Backus.This dvd boxed set includes all 20 episodes on 3 discs (2 are double-sided). Unfortunately, there are no extra features. An interview with Darren McGavin and a documentary on the history of the show would have been most welcomed. Still, having all the episodes together without the interruption of commercials and cuts is something to cheer about.All 20 episodes are included:Disc 1:#1 ""The Ripper"" - Jack the Ripper revisits the 20th century. This episode is reminiscent of the two tv films that inspired the series - ""The Night Stalker,"" and ""The Night Strangler."" Very creepy, atmospheric and suspensful despite some holes in the plot.#2 ""The Zombie"" - Voodoo enters the world of organized crime. You will be squirming in your seat when Kolchak attempts to sew up the lips of a sleeping zombie!#3 ""They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be..."" - Missing animals from the local zoo are found with their bone marrow extracted.#4 ""The Vampire"" - A Las Vegas call girl is using her customers as her meals. One of my favorite episodes.#5 ""The Werewolf"" - Kolchak takes a vacation on a cruise ship and so does a werewolf. Not the best episode - the werewolf looks like an actor in a Halloween costume and it seems to end abruptly.#6 ""Firefall"" - An ""X-Files"" type episode that deals with spontaneous combustion.#7 ""The Devil's Platform - A politician is gaining prominence after he sells his soul to the devil.#8 ""Bad Medicine"" - An Indian takes the shape of various animals to kill wealthy women for their jewels.Disc #2:#9 ""The Spanish Moss Murders"" - A sleep subject is summoning a swamp monster which is terrorizing Chicago.#10 ""The Energy Eater"" - A new hospital is plagued by electrocution deaths.#11 ""Horror In The Heights"" - Senior citizens are being killed by a mysterious beast. One of the series best episodes.#12 ""Mr. R.I.N.G."" - A killer robot is connected to a top secret government project.#13 ""Primal Scream"" - A prehistoric creature is brought to life in an oil company's research laboratory.#14 ""The Trevi Collection"" - A coven of witches infitirate the fashion industry. Lara Parker, who plays the witch Madelaine, played the witch Angelique in the series ""Dark Shadows.""#15 ""Chooper"" - A headless motorcyle rider wants his head back.#16 ""Demon in Lace"" - A succubus stalks the campus of Illionois State Technical College.Disc 3:#17 ""Legacy of Terror"" - An ancient Aztec mummy is sacrificing guests at a hotel.#18 ""The Knightly Murders"" - A medieval knight seeks revenge on developers who plan to transform a museum into a nightclub.#19 ""The Youth Killer"" - Applicants to a dating service are dying from instant aging.#20 ""The Sentry"" - An ancient lizard-like creature dwells beneath an archives building.",4,Just in time for Halloween,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,3876,"['Night', 'Stalker', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', '1974-1975', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Sometimes', 'creepy', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'series', 'usually', 'good', 'combination', 'chills', 'laughs', 'most', 'series', 'suffers', 'poor', 'episodes', 'bad', 'episode', 'Mr.', 'R.I.N.G', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'Ripper', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'Ripper', 'Vampire', 'Horror', 'Heights', 'Zombie', 'Spanish', 'Moss', 'Murders', 'One', 'elements', 'series', 'memorable', 'are', 'actors', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'bumbling', 'seersucker', 'suit', 'straw', 'hat', 'wearing', 'reporter', 'Carl', 'Kolchak', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'shrill', 'hilarious', 'boss', 'delightful', 'Ruth', 'McDevitt', 'co-worker', 'Miss', 'Emily', 'hard', 'see', 'where', 'inspiration', 'came', 'new', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'series', 'deadpan', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'who', 'be', 'channeling', 'zombies', 'instead', 'Darren', 'McGavin.Some', 'guest', 'stars', 'include', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'Lara', 'Parker', 'Nina', 'Foch', 'Phil', 'Silvers', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'Jim', 'Backus.This', 'dvd', 'boxed', 'set', '20', 'episodes', '3', 'discs', '2', 'are', 'double-sided', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'interview', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'documentary', 'history', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'welcomed', 'Still', 'having', 'episodes', 'together', 'interruption', 'commercials', 'cuts', 'something', 'cheer', 'about.All', '20', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'Disc', '1', '1', 'Ripper', 'Jack', 'Ripper', '20th', 'century', 'episode', 'reminiscent', 'two', 'tv', 'films', 'inspired', 'series', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'Night', 'Strangler', 'Very', 'creepy', 'atmospheric', 'suspensful', 'holes', 'plot.', '2', 'Zombie', 'Voodoo', 'world', 'organized', 'crime', 'will', 'be', 'squirming', 'seat', 'when', 'Kolchak', 'sew', 'up', 'lips', 'sleeping', 'zombie', '3', 'Have', 'Been', 'Are', 'Will', 'Be', 'Missing', 'animals', 'local', 'zoo', 'are', 'found', 'bone', 'marrow', 'extracted.', '4', 'Vampire', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'call', 'girl', 'using', 'customers', 'meals', 'One', 'favorite', 'episodes.', '5', 'Werewolf', 'Kolchak', 'vacation', 'cruise', 'ship', 'so', 'werewolf', 'Not', 'best', 'episode', 'werewolf', 'actor', 'Halloween', 'costume', 'end', 'abruptly.', '6', 'Firefall', 'X-Files', 'type', 'episode', 'deals', 'spontaneous', 'combustion.', '7', 'Devil', 'Platform', 'politician', 'gaining', 'prominence', 'soul', 'devil.', '8', 'Bad', 'Medicine', 'Indian', 'shape', 'various', 'animals', 'kill', 'wealthy', 'women', 'jewels.Disc', '2', '9', 'Spanish', 'Moss', 'Murders', 'sleep', 'subject', 'summoning', 'swamp', 'monster', 'terrorizing', 'Chicago.', '10', 'Energy', 'Eater', 'new', 'hospital', 'plagued', 'electrocution', 'deaths.', '11', 'Horror', 'Heights', 'Senior', 'citizens', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'mysterious', 'beast', 'One', 'series', 'best', 'episodes.', '12', 'Mr', 'R.I.N.G', 'killer', 'robot', 'connected', 'top', 'secret', 'government', 'project.', '13', 'Primal', 'Scream', 'prehistoric', 'creature', 'brought', 'life', 'oil', 'company', 'research', 'laboratory.', '14', 'Trevi', 'Collection', 'coven', 'witches', 'infitirate', 'fashion', 'industry', 'Lara', 'Parker', 'who', 'witch', 'Madelaine', 'played', 'witch', 'Angelique', 'series', 'Dark', 'Shadows', '15', 'Chooper', 'headless', 'motorcyle', 'rider', 'head', 'back.', '16', 'Demon', 'Lace', 'succubus', 'campus', 'Illionois', 'State', 'Technical', 'College.Disc', '3', '17', 'Legacy', 'Terror', 'ancient', 'Aztec', 'mummy', 'sacrificing', 'guests', 'hotel.', '18', 'Knightly', 'Murders', 'medieval', 'knight', 'revenge', 'developers', 'who', 'plan', 'transform', 'museum', 'nightclub.', '19', 'Youth', 'Killer', 'Applicants', 'dating', 'service', 'are', 'dying', 'instant', 'aging.', '20', 'Sentry', 'ancient', 'lizard-like', 'creature', 'archives', 'building']",N/A

933596,A3CDR7VEX55JAD,B000ATQYWY,"Red Wood ""critic""","[2, 2]","As many a fan here, ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" was my first favorite prime time TV program (unless ""Wonderful World of Disney"" can be counted, which aired before 7PM on Sundays). I was 9 years old & many shows on TV, since the 60s, had become adult themed. However, 1974 saw the debuts of ""Little House on the Prairie"", ""Planet of the Apes"", ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" (which cost me from seeing many an episode of ""Planet -""), ""Kung Fu"", ... and this one.But I still had to fight to see ""Night Stalker"", even though it was on @ 9PM on Fridays, opposite only ""Police Woman"". Needless to say, the series quickly became a bit long in the tooth, dragging a bit (& I was only 9) & the better episodes didn't really start popping up until after a month - and then it was pretty much every other one (however, on dvd, without commercials, the pace isn't too bad). The writing's quite good, @ times, especially the banter between the two lead characters, newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) and his editor Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland). Some episodes are even near brilliant (such as my favorite, ""Horror in the Heights""), quite creepy (including my other favorite, ""Fire Fall"", as well as ""The Vampire"" & ""The Spanish Moss Murders""), or tend to offer a feeling of dread (""The Devil's Platform"", ""The Zombie"", ""Demon in Lace"").For the most part, Darren McGavin's portrayal of the witty, ironic, bumbling wordsmith Kolchak makes the show, even in its lesser moments and, although it can definitely bog down with too much dialogue and little action, I thought nearly 50% of the series was decent, if not quite good (though the 1974 episodes are better than the spring '75 ones). There are those childhood memories that can be better left as a memory (several of mine, it turns out), but then there are those that are surprisingly alright.I'm happy to report that this is one of them that holds up.

The light levels of the projection device were so low that all night scenes are so dark that nothing, absolutely nothing can be seen in some parts. Other parts are so dark that only vague shadows can be seen. I took the discs to work and scoped them out. The white and black levels are in acceptable ranges of 100% white and 7.5% for black. This is not the problem. The film to video transfer had insuficiencent projection level to resolve the images.Night Stalker looks like a bad 1950's home movie transfer.

He was clueless, it was too dark to see.Don't waste your money on this poor, poor cash in. Night Stalker deserves a real high level transfer and remastering, Universal is definitely not universal unless junk is how they define the universal standard. Record the reruns off the Sci Fi channel. These transfers are just fine and you can see everything quite well. Even with the cuts and commercials they are much more enjoyable than this terrible collection.Big, big, big dissapointment...",1,"Another great example of how ""not"" to do a film to DVD transfer!",1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,1848,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'have', 'worked', 'video', 'industry', 'Broadcast', 'VHS', 'Duplication', 'now', 'DVD', 'authoring', 'replication', 'business', '15', 'years', 'understand', 'video', 'quality.Secondly', 'let', 'say', 'love', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'Series', 'was', 'anxious', 'hell', 'see', 'released', 'day', 'DVD.The', 'day', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'bought', 'night', 'started', 'watching', 'it.Now', 'bad', 'part', 'quality', 'film', 'video', 'transfers', 'are', 'worst', 'have', 'seen', 'light', 'levels', 'projection', 'device', 'were', 'so', 'low', 'night', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'dark', 'nothing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'parts', 'Other', 'parts', 'are', 'so', 'dark', 'only', 'vague', 'shadows', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'took', 'discs', 'work', 'scoped', 'out', 'white', 'black', 'levels', 'are', 'acceptable', 'ranges', '100', '%', 'white', '7.5', '%', 'black', 'not', 'problem', 'film', 'video', 'transfer', 'had', 'insuficiencent', 'projection', 'level', 'resolve', 'images.Night', 'Stalker', 'bad', '1950', 'home', 'movie', 'transfer', 'first', 'episode', 'Ripper', 'intense', 'battle', 'ripper', 'squad', 'police', 'kinds', 'action', 'jumping', 'shooting', 'such', 'going', 'remember', 'well', 'collection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'showed', 'video', 'expert', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'asked', 'tell', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'scene', 'was', 'clueless', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'see.Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'poor', 'poor', 'cash', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'real', 'high', 'level', 'transfer', 'remastering', 'Universal', 'definitely', 'not', 'universal', 'junk', 'how', 'define', 'universal', 'standard', 'Record', 'reruns', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'channel', 'transfers', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'quite', 'well', 'Even', 'cuts', 'commercials', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'terrible', 'collection.Big', 'big', 'big', 'dissapointment']",N/A

Only Ruth DeVitt, as the lovable Miss Emily Cowles appeared to be Kolchak's only comfort. There were dumb episodes, ""Werewolf & Zombie"" come to mind. However, this was fun TV.

The narrative opens with Kolchak in sleazy hotel room, dictating a book into his trademark portable tape recorder, regurgitating the very strange events relating a case he just finished investigation on Las Vegas strip of a number of gruesome murders perpetrated by a vampire.The success of the production led to a short run series as he is portrayed as a gifted investigative reporter with an attraction for unusual and paranormal occurrences, the viewer see him procuring evidence driving around Chicago in his yellow Ford Mustang convertible. Kolchak has persistently cracked several cases relying on gut instinct and often through sheer dumb luck. But more often than not, Kolchak's prospects are hindered by the complete obliteration of any or all proof to verify his claims. On other occasions his investigations have led to demotion or transfer of variable authority figures, the reasons for which are never truthfully disclosed, and hence the feeding the viewer's believe of a cover up.As a youth I caught this film late night on the TV and found the whole movie rather spooky and scary at times.

Now 30 years later, to watch them on DVD (and let's face it, like the 80's Twilight Zone DVD's, they were shot on film and the original masters were probably lost...be glad they're all available along with the original 2 TV-movies that introduced Carl Kolchak).  I now watch with amazement just how much Chris Carter copped this show for the X-files.  Many a time I wanted to throw something at the screen when Kolchak gets denied access or has a ham-handed response given by an authority figure (one of the drawbacks of watching the show all at once instead of a weekly installment); but even the whistling theme song during the opening credits got me thinking: Here we've been idolizing the X-files on its originality and cleverness when this show was doing the same thing 2 decades before.  Granted, a lot of the show's themes and looks are terribly dated in the 70's.  And the murders are usually done off-screen (or as a freeze-frame when the monster jumps out at its next victim).  ""Chopper"" is still one of the most tasteless episodes with the headless biker, but if you peel away the obvious fake ""headless"" mockup, you will find an update of ""Sleepy Hollow.""

While I will be the first to agree that yes the pilot episodes were head and shoulders above the series in quality of writing and quality of sets or special effects.  I stronly feel Kolchak - The Night Stalker the series took on an odd ball mix of both charm and humor along with its horror that made the overall viewing experience a unique pleasure nonetheless.  Yes by today's standards Kolchak - The Night Stalker fairs no better than Star Trek The Original Series does when compared to its brighter techno glitzy 90's spawn Star Trek the Next Generation that is a given.  But the old series had its own artistic merit.Kolchak - The Night Stalker was not all about horror it was a unique mix of horror and fun.  Unike the X files whose mission was to make you think Kolchak - The Night Stalker did not ask you to think.  Kolchak - The Night Stalker was like really wack wild strange friend who visited once a week suggesting LIKE DUDES AND SISTA'S HEY WHAT IF? as it began spinning its WAY Campy over the top tongue in cheek yarn begging you to just settle back and have a shock and giggle mixer with a bit of 70's disco era flava thrown in.Kolchak - The Night Stalker was the X Files for a more calm gentle age.

933620,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,B000ATQYWY,"The Critic ""Movie Maniac""","[0, 0]","Thanks to Universal Studios, the complete Kolchak ""The Night Stalker"" television series has finally been released on DVD. The video transfer is really decent and the 2.0 sound is pretty consistent and definitely better than I expected. All 20 episodes of this classic 70's TV series are spread out over 3 double sided discs and that's my only major complaint with this set.Universal Studios should abandon the double sided discs and go with single sided discs even if it means adding a few more dollars to the price of the set. In a few of the episodes, some of the night scenes are very dark and sometimes it's hard to make out the images. I give this classic show five stars all the way for pure entertainment value. Darren McGavin in my opinion was the perfect choice to play the Kolchak character and he played it to perfection.This set is well done with nice artwork and individual slim cases for the DVD's, but completely lacking in bonus material. Sadly Mr. McGavin passed away in Feb/2006, so why didn't the studio interview him for the DVD release of this classic show when they had the chance. Any commentary from Darren McGavin or a look back interview from him would have been a welcomed addition to this set. Universal Studios just doesn't get it, including bonus material is another reason to buy these classic shows on DVD.My only other gripe is that the two Kolchak movies should have been included in the set as well, to complete the entire series.

Yes, in retrospect, there is an element of camp to the series and the effects technologies of the early to mid 70's leave something to be desired but if you take the series as a whole, it is written very well. Unfortunately, much TV today is style and no substance and written by an increasingly younger crowd whose only references are popular culture in and of itself. Night Stalker is a compendium of world mythologies and myths wrapped up in a nice weekly formula. There is also the implication of world behind the one we experience every day. A very compelling idea in the time of Watergate and judging by current events, still a valid world view. Much of the horror and suspense is implied and I suspect that may be what leaves much younger viewers cold. If you've been raised on a diet of gore and CGI based effects this series seems like an antiquarian relic.

Not only that, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale (USED CARS, BACK TO THE FUTURE) wrote one of THE NIGHT STALKER's wildest episodes, ""Chopper,"" a modern-day update of the headless horseman legend (only now he rides a motorcycle).This was my favorite show as a kid.  The TV movies were written by Richard Matheson, who wrote I AM LEGEND, HELL HOUSE, and my favortie TWILIGHT ZONE episode, ""Nightmare at 30,000 Feet.""Although this series would lapse into a ""Monster of the Week"" formula that exhausted its concept (something THE X-FILES learned to avoid), the show itself did a great job of developing the office and its quirky reporters around the supernatural goings-on.  Vincenzo the screaming boss with an ulcer, ""Uptight"" the snooty rival, Miss Emily the doting grandmotherly presence.

The Night STalker was one of my favorite TV shows of the 1970's despite only lasting 20 episodes.  It would go on to inspire Chris Carter to create the X-Files and now has been revamped in a new show on ABC.While the TV show never quite achieved the level of greatness of the two made-for-TV films, it still was a fantastic show and one of the very few horror shows that made it to air in the 1970's.  Darrin McGavin was made to play nosy reporter Carl Kolchak who kept finding himself investigating the most bizarre stories and encountering strange creatures...yet invariably his stories would be squelched by his hot-headed editor Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland).  Kolchak dressed in his ruffled white suit and straw hat and always found himself at odds with local police officials who didn't appreciate his snooping.  It's still a fantastic show filled not only with chills, but also Kolchak's sarcastic humor which is what is lacking in the new series.My favorite episodes are:""The Vampire""  This is basically a sequel to the original Nightstalker movie as one of the vampires victims is ressurected and begins killing victims in LA.""The Devil's Platform""  CArl discovers that a Senator running for re-election has made a deal with the devil in order to kill off all of his challengers by taking the form of a large dog.""Bad Medicine"" the Spirit of an Indian Medicine man is killing wealthy socialites for their jewelry.  Kolchak has to somehow destroy the spirit.  The Indian is played by Richard Kiel best known as Jaws in the James Bond films.""The Spanish Moss Murders""  Call this Kolchak meats SwampThing as a series of grisly murders has taken place leaving the vitims covered in swampy moss.  Carl finds a muck monsters is to blame.Horror In the Heights""  Kolchak must face a Hindu evil spirit that can take the shape of any person.  Great Episode!""Demon In Lace""  Kolchak is investigating the deaths of several young college men of apparent heart attacks and learns that a middle-eastern demon called a succubus is responsible.""The Youth Killer""  Several customers of a dating service are found not only dead, but very old.  Kolchak discovers that helen of Troy is behind the murders and stealing their youth to maintain her own youth and beauty.Kolchak's frequent run-ins with his boss Tony always made for a good laugh and that banter is sorely missing from the new TV show.

The new series will more than likely be terrible, and two, that Universal will finally release the original series on DVD to coincide with the new series.  Nothing gets these studios off of their rears like self-promotion.  Well, all I can say is ""It's about time!""I loved watching Kolchak: The Night Stalker when it first aired (I was in 4th grade).  Reruns aired in the early 80's as part of a rotation on the CBS evening movie or late movie, or whatever they called it.  Sci-Fi has been running them occasionally with little or no pre-announcement and unfortunately 4 episodes (Legacy of Terror, Demon and Lace, Firefall, and The Energy Eater) have only been presented as two movies that merely combined the episodes into a confusing mess called ""Demon and the Mummy"" and ""Crackle of Death"".Finally we will have all 20 episodes as they should be seen.  The lack of special features is disappointing but not suprising.  As other reviewers have commented, I would love to hear commentary from Jeff Rice, David Chase, and/or especially Darren McGavin.  I don't normally review something before it hits the streets, but short of a gigantic mess-up on Universal's part, a high rating is definately warrented for this amazing series.Personal favorites: ""Horror In The Heights"" which the Kolchak Companion describes as the episode most likely to sell the series to a non-viewer.

I bought all of them on VHS from Columbia House and still will set aside a weekend for a Kolchak Marathon. I'm so glad it's out on DVD!For those of you who have never seen it, it's a quirky, sometimes comedic, always entertaining trip into the world of the supernatural. The seriesFrom vampires to zombies to headless motorcycle riders, this show was fantastic. Sadly, it only lasted a season, but the fact that it inspired The X-Files and Kolchak has become a cult icon says a lot about the show.Kolchak was the everyman. He didn't come out with lines like, ""Well, I know it's a soulless bloodsucker, but I have to do what I have to do.""No, when he was scared, he screamed. He ran away.  But. in the end, in his own haphazard way, he saved the day.This show is great for all ages.

933633,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000ATQYWY,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[319, 330]","Before ""The X-Files"", Darren McGavin was reporter Carl Kolchak whose news stories would focus on the supernatural and science fiction aspects of a story. ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" only ran a short (it was only about 20 episodes)season on ABC. Although it lacked the creative fire power of the two TV movies (Producer/director Dan Curtis, director John Moxey and writer Richard Matheson were not involved with the series at all), the best episodes had a sharp sense of humor and a couple of young contributors that would make their mark elsewhere (the creative team behind ""Back to the Future"" and the writer-producer of ""The Sopranos"" were both contributors to the series). I realize that writer/creator Jeff Rice ended up suing Universal over the TV series but do wish that an interview with him or commentary tracks had been included.Released to coincide with the new ""The Night Stalker"" TV series produced/written by Frank Spotnitz (""The X-Files"", ""The Lone Gunmen""), the series is bare bones when it comes to extras.. However, the episodes will be uncut which is a big plus for fans. Having had to suffer through versions burned from the Sci-Fi Channel broadcast, I'll be happy to finally have these sans commercial interruptions.There's good and bad news about the format; all these are released in the dual layered, dual sided format. Because it requires a disc to be ""pressed"" four times instead of two, there's a higher chance of problems with the discs.  Universal has, in the past, had a problem on occasion with the dual layered/dual sided DVDs freezing up (I recently had a problem with ""McCloud"" and others have had other problems). Hopefully they've solved the manufacturing snafu that caused this problem in the first place and this won't be a problem here. I didn't have any of the discs freeze up on me when I tried them but that doesn't mean that certain players may not have this problem because of flaws during the manufacturing process.The good news--at last this series is available on DVD. It doesn't look anywhere as good as MGM's release of ""The Night Stalker/The Night Strangler"". There's a lot of debris in the image and the images are very, very dark--much darker than necessary which makes night scenes kind of a problem to view at times (since much of the series takes place at night this could be a problem). The packaging is nice with the shows each stored in a single slim line jewel box which will help prevent wear and tear. ""Kolchak"" was recently voted the worst looking DVD transfer of 2005 (at TVonDVD)because of the poor contrast, image quality, etc. Should you still get it? Absolutely. If you're a videophile the image quality may bother you but if you're just watching it for the enjoyment of the show I doubt it will except on the first couple of episodes.Sure there were dogs here (the werewolf episode among them) but there were also some exceedingly good episodes that demonstrated a unique, quirky sense of humor that translated well to TV. As a monster-of-the-week horror series, ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" had no peers during the 70's. Among the best episodes are ""Horror in the Heights"" (written by Jimmy Sangster ""Horror of Dracula"")and a number of terrific episodes written by ""The Sopranos"" creator David Chase. I would have loved a commentary track from Jack Grinnage (Ron Updyke)but I suppose that's asking for too much. There are no extras outside of promos for other Universal products. Since there's a blank side on the last disc, there was plenty of room to include some. Why not include the promos that ran on ABC for the show? I'm sure there are vintage interviews with Darren McGavin. Since Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz are such great fans of the series why not interview them (along with Jeff Rice) for the set here?As a big fan of the late (he passed away in March 2006)Darren McGavin and fan of the original TV movies, I'm glad to see this finally coming to DVD but do wish that Universal had included either vintage interviews that McGavin gave at the time or, better yet, commentary tracks or current interviews with McGavin or the surviving cast/production members. It may not be perfect but, hey, at least it has finally arrived on DVD.Were there cheesy episodes? Sure but then again it's good cheese with witty dialogue and great performances from a seasoned cast of veterans. The best episodes showed wit and imagination and look pretty good even though optical effects and make up weren't quite as advanced as today. You can see Mulder to some extent in Kolchak and Scully's doubting Thomas in Vincenzo. If you get a chance you should also see Darren McGavin's two appearences on ""The X-Files"". He also has a cameo (via digital technology)in a witty tip of the hat in the pilot episode of the new ""Night Stalker"" TV series. Oh and got to love that seersucker suit! We'll miss you Darren but at least we have your terrific performances in film and TV shows!",4,At long last the wait is over,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,4936,"['X-Files', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'was',

Irvin ""Mr. Movie""","[2, 3]","I have read most of the reviews regarding this complete box set of the 1974-75 ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" television series, and will have to hold my vote until I've had the opportunity to see all the episodes. I have seen the first show, ""The Ripper"", and agree that the picture is very, very dark and hard to make out in many scenes. That does bother me a bit, but what bothers me even more are the many reviews below indicating that the double-sided DVDs are quite prone to freezing, skipping or even (in one case) locking up one poster's DVD player! It is almost with dread that I begin viewing the remaining 19 episodes! I just know I will be EXPECTING some sort of malfunction which will take away from the pleasure and fun of enjoying these priceless shows again! It seems that any TV show which was (or is) remotely popular is now, or soon will be, featured as a boxed DVD set. While this is a good thing on the face of it, the fact that these studios keep cranking them out at a record pace can only mean cutting corners and cutting costs in order to get them into circulation as fast as possible. As a result, we get certain studios (read: UNIVERSAL) who can't see beyond a buck, and take an assembly line approach to spewing out their boxed TV sets, instead of taking the time to show consumers they care about quality over quantity. I have also purchased Universal's first season boxed set of Alfred Hitchcock Presents and, while there are also quality issues with that set as well (it doesn't appear as though this set was restored or cleaned up, either), so far I haven't had any real problems with it, although I have only viewed around half of the AHP shows to date.) If you read the reviews of the AHP series on this Amazon website, you will also find several people have had malfunction issues with it. That set is also featured on 'flipper discs'. So, here I go..... about to watch the second episode of Kolchak as, all the while, in the back of my mind, I am just WAITING for the other shoe to drop, and one of the epsiodes to freeze up on me! This will surely detract from my viewing enjoyment. The 4-star rating I have given is for the excellence of the series itself, which most certainly qualifies for 5 stars in my book.
