Maybe, with magic and a little luck, you wouldn't have to.Cindy and Jim Green (played by Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton) are a married couple who live in the drought-stricken town of Stanleyville and who struggled to have a child of their own until their doctor told them they were infertile. As a means of moving past this trauma, Jim and Cindy sit down in their living room, write out all the qualities they would want in a child on small slips of paper, puts those slips of a paper in a box, bury the box in their backyard, and go to bed. A thunderstorm begins and ends while they sleep and only affects their home. When Jim and Cindy hear noises in their supposedly empty house, they investigate and find a ten year-old boy sitting on their kitchen counter who tells them his name is Timothy. Timothy (played by CJ Adams) tells the Greens that he is their child and, rather than look a gift horse in the mouth, they take him to the room they prepared for the child they couldn't have, and put him to bed. The next day they introduce Timothy to Cindy's sister, Brenda (played by Rosemarie DeWitt) whose children lived programmed lives and excel in several areas such as music and academics. Additionally, they meet Jim's distant father, with whom Jim has a difficult relationship, also named James (played by David Morse). All while trying to conceal the fact that Timothy has leaves sprouting from his legs that cannot be removed.In spite of the science fiction, ABC Family elements, I liked this movie. No, it's not amazing or revolutionary, but the characters are extremely likeable in addition to being entertaining. Rosemarie DeWitt as Garner's sister and arch nemesis is the kind of character you can't help but be annoyed by. Edgerton, determined to be a better father than his own, is very sympathetic. Morse's character is less so, but has some redeeming moments.

This PG rated ""family film"" features a loving couple played by Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner who have been unsuccessful at having a biological child.  The film opens at an adoption center where they are making their case to adopt a child, the basis of which is shown in flashback.It seems Jim and Cindy Green, unhappy over their inability to conceive - we never learn exactly why - play a fantasy game of what their perfect child would be like.  They write down the characteristics on paper, place them in a small box and bury them in their garden.  After a rain storm, voil&agrave;!, a 10 old boy appears in their home covered in dirt.  He also has a few irremovable leaves on his legs.Unfortunately this film, written and directed by Peter Hedges, is so sugary sweet and bereft of artistic value, it was just hard to watch.  Certainly Jennifer Garner wasn't a stretch to play the part of mom-of-the-year but she is given ridiculous dialog.  In one scene she is explaining to her new ""son"" that most of his schoolmates come from their mother's tummies, not from the ground.  Good grief.  And Edgerton, I suspect hoping to stretch his acting chops, just kind of stands around looking forlorn most of the time.  Terribly miscast.

1487846,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B005LAIIKS,,"[12, 21]","The Odd life of Timothy Green(released Aug/12)stars Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton as the Green family.What I thought would be,as the movie started to unfold,an eclectic idea that would blossom into something special,unfortunately turned into a 100 minute yawn fest.The only other thing I can compare watching this film to is watching paint dry on a wet and damp day.It is that much fun....no,pardon me,it is totally BORING!A snail on Prozac could beat this movies pace in a heartbeat.The story involves the Greens(much too obvious,don`t you think)and their unsuccessful efforts to produce children.The couple attend an adoption agency and the story unfolds as they tell their strange tale to the two people sitting in front of them.After a frustrating and disappointing time with their fertility doctor,the couple return home.The couple start making post-it notes as to how they would want their imaginary child to be like.They put them all into a wooden box,which they plant in their garden.That night it rains terribly hard(and,as we learn later,only on their property)and while in bed an intruder enters the house.They search and find a dirt covered 10 year old in what would have been their nursery had they had a child.Voila,instant family.The only boys name in the box they planted was Timothy,so that is what he's called.He is introduced as an adopted child to their family.Timothy has several leaves growing out of the bottom of his legs,which the parents keep covered at all times,lest people start asking questions about...his roots(sorry).The Green's aren't perfect parents by any means and wing alot of their parental actions,but they mean well.They love Timothy and he loves them.Timothy starts a relationship with a girl a little older than him and an outcast in her own right,as she sports a blood coloured birth mark on her right front shoulder area.As the film progresses Timothy starts to slowly lose leaves off of his leg.Eventually autumn comes and Tim first breaks the news of his impending departure to his girlfriend.Comes one night Timothy must finally leave for good.As dawn breaks the next day in comes the adoption agency with the Green`s newly adopted daughter,and now they can start a life long commitment with a real child.The film is so agonizingly slow that it never gets one interested in its plot at all.It meanders from one thing to another in such a leisurely manner that before you know it you are clock watching within just a few minutes of its start.I cannot imagine anyone 12 and under sitting still for 100 minutes to watch this.It rules out teenagers also and older adults...well that's problematic at best.I cannot think of a single movie in recent memory that has had me so disinterested in its plot so fast as this.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a music video and deleted scenes.All in all this is a family yawn fest of humungous proportions,that is,as  Peter Noone might musically muse,a must to avoid.The meandering plot will have you looking at your watch quicker than you can say ""pass the grey poupon"".Zzzzzzzz.",1,"I know,what say we watch paint dry?",1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,3130,"['Odd', 'life', 'Timothy', 'Green', 'released', 'Aug/12', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Joel', 'Edgerton',

Wilee's daring style of riding a bike without gears or brakes is also typical of extreme self-esteem of young Americans bend to taking extreme risks. mostly leading death in the USA at adolescence to its peak among the whole world.Another dilemma was of a police officer struggling with gambling, psychotic temper, and uninhibited bend on corruption.A third dilemma relates to international Chinese mobs exploiting their own people through bribes and money laundering in exchange for permitting them to leave China to the USA.The hard-working Chinese woman cannot get her son out of China without bribing the Chinese mob with her three-year saving. The New York City couriers unaware of the conflict between various factions of Chinese mobs got entangled via the corrupt police officer owing on faction a large sum of borrowed gambling money.Through constant action, the courier and his fellows and though a roommate of the Chinese woman felt her pain with immigration and bribery, consolidated their effort to get the woman's money to her abusers at home, while fending her off of lesser abusers.With the little boy leaving China after the mob got their ransom $50K, the New York City couriers returned to their usual business of fighting for living in the most dangerous, yet greatest city in the world.Another chapter in liberty and pursuit of happiness presented in an action movie.Mohamed F.

My 12 year old was pretty excited about it, and I had seen the previews and thought it could really be a great movie.  Well, depending on your parenting styles I suppose, it was an okay movie.  Timothy is played very well by the actor, and who doesn't love Jennifer Garner?  I really enjoyed the beginning of the movie, the magical appearance of Timothy and the joy of ""his parents"".  But then, it just got too unbelievable.  Sure, I can go along with a boy coming out of a garden with leaves on his legs, but his parents behavior just didn't pan out for me.  The worst was the whole soccer thing.  Clearly the boy couldn't play soccer, didn't care to play soccer, but yet he is on a team where he doesn't get to play and he is happy being the water boy.  What enlightened parent puts their child on a team where he gets no respect and sits on the bench for every game?  That seemed so selfish of the parents to me.  And then the mom going after Timothy's best friend, Joni.  She lets her son do whatever he wants (no after school supervision) and then complains to the girl he likes, and who treats him as an equal, that she is no good for him???  At least she comes to see the light, but her judgmental behavior is not anything to admire.  And really, would a girl that cool(?), and that much older than Timothy really hang out with him?  Of course she could, but I would have thought they might have made the 2 kids look more the same age.  To me it looked like an elementary school kid hanging out with a middle school kid, it just didn't fit right. And Timothy is losing leaves left and right, don't the ""parents"" notice that?Still, it is an entertaining movie, I just wish they would have done a few things differently to make it seem more realistic, or perhaps, portray the parents in a better light.  They should have risen to the occasion instead of being petty and competitive and trying to make Timothy something he wasn't.  My daughter loved it and continues to berate us for our over analysis of it.

For a long time, they have invested their emotions, their effort, and their dwindling finances into trying to have a child. After their arduous efforts fail, they find themselves sitting across from their infertility doctor, who sheepishly tells them that they have exhausted their options, and that pregnancy will not happen for them. They are devastated, but decide to spend one last evening dreaming about who their child would have been, in an effort to mourn and move on. Disney magic happens, and their dream son, Timothy, grows up overnight from their garden. He has leaves on his shins. He also has a navel, but I'm not sure why.  Jim and Cindy spend the next two hours or so adjusting to having a son, working through their feelings towards other parents they have known, and by their own admission, making mistakes. Timothy disappears, but encourages Jim and Cindy by telling them that they were always ready to be parents. A year passes, and Jim and Cindy decide to pursue parenting through either adoption or foster care.The movie is good for people considering adoption. The Greens grieve their infertility in what seems to be a healthy manner. They struggle with the desire for Timothy to keep secrets, before finally realizing that it's healthier for him to share his unique story. They defend Timothy from members of their family who criticize him unfairly.There are some concerning aspects to the movie, and if you're considering adoption, it'd be best to know going in: the Greens have a terrifyingly bad interview with an adoption social worker. The worker is cold, rude, rushed, and uncaring. I've interviewed hundreds of adoptive families and trained several other adoption workers. We're not as mean as the social worker in this movie.

The movie is told after the fact as a story to child adoption case workers and the couple trying to explain their qualifications for adoption.This is sort of Kyle XY & Phenomenon meets Richie Cunningham, and Happy Days is what sticks, in fact, I might say watching this is like 3-4 episodes of Happy Days the TV show back-to-back.The movie does not even attempt to tie up loose ends, tackle obvious questions, like how does an 8 year old show up and no one questions where he came from, they just sort of glaze over that part.So in the end this is a feel good movie that will be on the Hallmark Channel in a short while, for most I would say wait for the TV movie to come out, however, if you are looking for a break from the kill everything in sight movies, just want to relax with the family and see an enjoyable albiet sappy flick, this is a good choice.",3,OK for Rental - Good family flick,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,1387,"['went', 'more', 'info', 'Amazon', 'description', '3', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'deceptive', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'movie', ""shoot'em"", 'up', 'fung-fu', 'swearing', 'not', 'even', 'many', 'dirty', 'looks', 'much', 'less', 'anything', 'dirty', 'count', 'muddy', 'kid', 'start.The', 'movie', 'couple', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'baby', 'hearing', 'news', 'doctors', 'having', 'kids', 'just', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'sad', 'new', 'couple', 'decide', 'write', 'down', 'qualities', 'kid', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'movie', 'magic', 'movie', 'told', 'fact', 'story', 'child', 'adoption', 'case', 'workers', 'couple', 'trying', 'explain', 'qualifications', 'adoption.This', 'sort', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'Phenomenon', 'Richie', 'Cunningham', 'Happy', 'Days', 'what', 'sticks', 'fact', 'might', 'say', 'watching', '3-4', 'episodes', 'Happy', 'Days', 'TV', 'show', 'back-to-back.The', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'attempt', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'tackle', 'obvious', 'questions', 'how', '8', 'year', 'old', 'show', 'up', 'one', 'questions', 'where', 'came', 'just', 'sort', 'glaze', 'part.So', 'end', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'short', 'while', 'most', 'would', 'say', 'wait', 'TV', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'however', 'are', 'looking', 'break', 'kill', 'everything', 'sight', 'movies', 'just', 'want', 'relax', 'family', 'see', 'enjoyable', 'albiet', 'sappy', 'flick', 'good', 'choice']",The Odd Life of Timothy Green

I recall seeing a few advertisements for it when it was released to theaters, but I never got a chance to see it until I watched it on DVD last night. Disney was nice enough to send me an advanced copy in exchange for my honest review.At first I thought The Odd Life of Timothy Green was based on a book, but I was mistaken as it was based on the concept by Ahmet Zappa. It was written and directed by Peter Hedges (What's Eating Gilbert Grape).Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner star as Jim and Cindy Green, a couple living in the small drought-stricken town of Stanleyville, North Carolina. Jim spends his days working at the town's historic pencil factory while Cindy works at the local museum. The couple desperately wants to have children, but they find out they cannot conceive a child.Heartbroken, they write down their dream child's characteristics onto pieces of paper, put the pieces into a wooden box and buried it in their garden.Strangely, a thunderstorm occurs only on their property and they are awaken in the middle of the night by the appearance of a ten-year-old boy named Timothy covered in mud. After cleaning the mud off, Jim and Cindy discover the boy has leaves growing on his legs. Even more odd is that there is a now hole in their garden and the wooden box they buried has been crushed.The Greens takes the boy in and introduces Timothy to their family and friends as their adopted son. To their surprise, Timothy is not like other boys as he has a special gift that will forever change their lives.There are not many clean-cut family films anymore, but The Odd Life of Timothy Green is a heartfelt film that the entire family can watch together. By the few advertisements I saw on television, I already had a good idea what the premise was about. Most fantasies focuses on special effects, but The Odd Life of Timothy Green focuses on human emotion brought to life by a well written script and marvelous acting by the entire cast. Overall, I enjoyed watching every bit of the movie as it was a breath of fresh air.

Thurlow,"[16, 17]","Once upon a time, Walt Disney Studios made family-oriented movies with a message, wrapped around the small joys and trials of ordinary life.  Turns out they still do.  ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" has an unexpected if charming premise, but the story is mostly about ordinary people working through a variety of family and life issues.  It is a sentimental movie, but the laughs and the heartstring-tugging will work for most viewers.Once upon a time in a small town, a young couple, Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton), frustrated by their inability to conceive, bury their hopes and dreams about a child in a box in their garden.  A strange overnight storm presents them with Timothy, a young boy who is a miracle in more ways than one.  Cindy and Jim will be challenged to provide instant parenting to Timothy, and to explain his sudden appearence in their lives to their respective families and neighbors.The movie layers multiple sub-plots one on another, including a dying parent and a distant one, sibling rivalries, an uncaring boss, a townwide crisis over a closing factory, a kid's soccer team, and a young girl looking for a kindred soul. Timothy will play a role in each of these sub-plots, which are populated with an exceptionally solid supporting cast.  The movie telegraphs its ending, but it still manages to be both moving and entertaining.

1487916,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005LAIIKS,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE ODD LIFE OF TIMOTHY GREEN is a Disney family production that I found rather bland and somewhat ""blah"". Not to mention it was silly, unimaginative and left me with a bunch of blind alleys that were never explored. Oh, it's fine for family viewing if you're watching with kids 8 and under ... as a satisfying ""all-family"" film, it fell short.Two desperate parents (the chameleonic Joel Edgerton and the stunning-as-ever Jennifer Garner) finally fall off their hamster wheel when they realize they can't have a child. They compile a list of their dream boy, naming him Timothy, put the list in a box and bury it in the lush garden of mom-to-be. Guess what sprouts out of the ground, with leafy ankles and all?Though Georgia was the stand-in for Illinois, my home state, it was satisfactory and beautiful to admire. At least they got the license plates and the accents right. Which leads me to Aussie Joel Edgerton, who can out-accent anyone on the silver screen today as far as I'm concerned.Of course this is a star vehicle for the charming, far-older-than-his-years CJ Adams as Timothy. This kid is funny, talented, frankly he's a bit stunning for such a small boy - and I see a great acting future for him if he avoids the usual dark Alleywood. But the rest of this is ... well, it's boring family popcorn fare, lacking any real magic at all.I mean, a kid sprouts in your garden - a dream child, just the right age and everything you could want, but we have no idea what type of creature this really is. It isn't human by any means. Is he a gnome? A sprite? A fairy? And he's not planning to stay all that long anyway, for reasons you will see. This film lacked anything remotely resembling magic, charm, or even family-fun interest.Kudos to all the cast. What a marvel to see such talent boiling over in such a dull picture parade. If they'd gotten that cast together to make the new ""STAR WARS"" film, that would be the film of the decade.

They put all those qualities in a box and bury it in their garden in their effort to ""move on.""  But unusual things happen that night - a huge storm rains only on their house and a little boy named Timothy (with leaves growing out of his ankles) shows up in their house, muddy and naked.He immediately calls them Mom and Dad and, after realizing that he is a magical gift from the garden, they welcome him and the challenges of parenthood, learning along the way.The plot is fantastic and a little plodding.

In the case of ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green,"" he may have succeeded as time proves its value and it touches more lives through Blu-ray and DVD.For the time being, I'm sure audiences were as perplexed as I was when I saw the trailers. Even as the movie, my wife and I were intrigued but still disconcerted (""Really? A pencil factory?"")But as we watched we were very drawn into this very simple, elegantly presented story -- gorgeously filmed in Georgia (though in the audio commentary --THANK YOU -- the director admits there were some leaves added to trees for some shots.)We have had our own issues in child bearing, as have our friends, and had we lost a child through tragedy or illness, ""Timothy Green"" might be hard to enjoy. It is no spoiler that Timothy's visit is temporary -- it's telegraphed constantly throughout the film, but the departure is not as maudlin as it might have been under less skillful hands. It's bittersweet but enriched with hope and growth.It's also filled with gentle humor and superb performances by Jennifer Garner, Australian actor Joel Edgerton, the always-great Dianne Wiest and Ron Livingston (who seems to be aging into Joe ""Joey Zaza"" Mantegna. This is definitely worth seeing.Everyone may come away with a different impression, depending on their relationship with their parents, siblings and chlldbirth experiences. I found it similar to Walt Disney's ""Pollyanna"" in the sense that one person can, in their small way, have a profound effect on people.""It's a Wonderful Life"" was not a box office bonanza when it was first released. It's premise, though we've now seen dozens of knock-offs since, was probably strange to theatergoers back in the '40s.

All of the actors played the parts well and the movie was very well done. It tends to be a real tear-jerker at the end, but the story is beautiful and touching. Of course it's fiction, but it is sensitively done in a way that draws you into the story. The outcome of the movie becomes obvious fairly early in the story line, but this really doesn't detract from the movie. you're left feeling like you wish it had ended differently but it does have a sort of happy ending (just like a fairy tale should).

I was quite pleased with this fantasy film and think it contains excellent messages.  Like the story ""Tuck Everlasting"", it is packaged in a family-type wrapping, but in many ways it is a fable for adults.  There is a lot of symbolism that will be lost on younger children, and I think it can be watched by ALL but appreciated more by older children and adults.The film starts by dealing with the painful reality that many couples face when they are told they are not able to conceive children.  In their grief, the couple writes on pieces of paper about what they had dreamed for their child.  He'll be artistic, he'll score the winning goal in a game, he'll be kind, and he'll have all the qualities that they have themselves, etc.  They bury these in a box in the garden and overnight a miracle happens.  The child they had dreamed of appears in their garden.  This leads to interesting and humourous consequences.This movie has a number of lessons.  Children can learn from how the story embraces the idea that it's okay to be different.  Having something unique about you is good, and you don't need to be ashamed to show it.  Also, moms and dads are human and are doing the best they can.  Sometimes they make mistakes, but are figuring out a lot of things as they go.  The deeper theme which is more likely to be appreciated by teens and adults is about how children are a gift that is not to be squandered.  We see the various ""pitfalls of parenting"" and mistakes that parents make in real life.  The parents are shown as well meaning but making mistakes as they try to figure out what to do. Parenting is shown as a learning process too!  Also, the idea that we have only a certain amount of time with our children comes across very clearly.  We have valuable opportunities to touch each other's lives, but time passes quickly.I didn't really understand what ""brief language"" they were talking about in the review, but during the second viewing I think I heard the ""h-word"" a couple of times. One character says, ""Oh dear God"" and I think the obnoxious sister character may have said God's name once quietly.  I am very sensitive to such things, but was not offended by this movie at all.  In fact it was advertised as having a G rating here in Canada.  My personal preference would be that they prayed for a child.  In the story we assume it is magic, but we don't know the source of the miracle.I found this movie to be quite moving and was thinking a lot about the story after I left the theatre.  This film really has a bit of everything:  depth, humour, lessons, and a bit of romance too. The cinematography, especially the scenes with the Autumn leaves, is very beautiful and you can tell the director is good because of his attention to detail. I also like how the couple has a loving marriage and treat each other with kindness and respect.  It's just so nice to see a clean movie that also contains depth that can be appreciated by people of all ages.

It has the passion in it enough to grab your heart strings - and tug a little on them - more than once.The story is fanciful and magical in nature and has a touch of sci-fi thrown in, but the real thrust of this drama is the family unit. It's about parents and their children and how a small town deals with the drama's of a failing economy, bragging relatives and the gossip of neighbors that happens everywhere and anywhere you may live! It tends to slow down in a couple places - but there are very memorable scenes throughout.Now, imagine not being able to have children, for whatever reason - and you and your spouse found a unique way of coming to terms with it - by `wishing' the qualities you would like your `dream child' to have and then in superficial way planting them in the ground.Enter the element of magic, sci-fi or the `powers' from above - and a small child - played with such style, wit and humor by Cameron CJ Adams (Dan In Real Life) and you have a real family unit. His performances makes you smile more than once throughout the film and keeps you guessing about his motivations and origins.The real heart of the movie is the wonderful performances the two leads do together of showing true parenting - played perfectly by Jennifer Garner (Alias, Juno, Daredevil) and Joel Edgerton (The Thing-2011, Star Wars - Episode 2 & 3). Their on screen chemistry they had was completely heart-warming and when adding Cameron into the mix, the scenes with the three of them was extremely real.One other notable performance was by the amazing Ms. Dianne Weist (Edward Scissorhands, Parenthood) who gives perfect performance of a stiff, uptight and over-indulged boss of Jennifer - will make you remember her `chinny-chin-chin'! You'll have to see it to understand that reference! Dianne will definitely make you roll yours and even laugh more than once throughout the film.Special note to composer Geoff Zanelli (Gamer, Secret Window) - who created a modern and audibly unique score for the film. It moved the emotions of comedy and drama very seemlessly and I believed helped in the overall ambiance and mood of the film.This is a really good film for the entire family - a little short of story - but real in delivery.  It portrays real people in a `magical-sci-fi' situation that brings forth what new parents are really dealing with. It also ends on a very happy note!

To come up with a movie that questions and gives different perspectives, of Love, Loss, Ignorance, Fear of The Unknown. throughout the movie it was subtle, but one could catch the images and moments when the director and writer of this beautiful film weaved many instances where Love was formed, where it comes from, is there really any length or boundaries for it? Showed the small ignorance and greed of selfishness, and the fabrication of unhappiness that stems from not looking up once in awhile and taking in a deep breath and relaxing, and enjoying the gift of Life. Timothy was the kid who anybody could easily fall in love with, he was cute, adorable, intelligent, creative, inspiring and has a heart of gold that transcended his physical body. The story of his leaves were beautiful. It really made me think, and brought me to tears when that instance of never take for granted what you are given, because it can easily be taken from you.. but only because it i meant to be. That scene. Heart-warming, and Heart-breaking at the same time, where it made you think about Life. It made you think about Love. The essence of one's own Happiness. And the journey for one's own pursuit of Happiness. Timothy was so strong for his parents, that moment when the story unfolded even more, about the beautiful significance of his leaves. Flawless.

Actually the acting was well done all around. This is definitely one of those family movies I'll watch again and again. And I say so what if this was a Disney ""feel good"" movie. It did leave a smile on mine and my Grandpa's face at the end. And no tear-jerkers too.The storyline is nice and, I think, original. It's about a young boy who magically appears in the Green's life after the couple plants a wish in their backyard. Their wish is their ideal child because they've just learned they can't conceive their own. So that right there, I think is aimed more for the older kids who (like say maybe over 8). The Green's get to have Timothy in their life and as their son for less than a year (I think it's less than - not sure). So it's about the couple's hardships in raising Timothy. I also think that by opening with the child adaption interview, there wasn't too much sadness felt towards the end because you knew that was going to happen.This is a good family movie. Yes, it's unbelievable. But there was a lot of good hidden meanings throughout the movie. The key one was the couple doing everything they can in making sure that Timothy had a ""normal"" childhood even though he was ""special.""

What I am thoroughly impressed by is that this was put out by Disney and yet didn't feel like the typical live action Disney film. I was blown away by it's depth and it's heart.For children it is a good lesson on tolerance and compassion.  For parents and teachers it will hit straight to the heart. The young couple are pitch perfect in their performance and is probably Garner's best film aside from Juno. The young boy playing the title character will impress you with his depth,  sweetness and will steal your heart.What I love about this film is it's simple reminder of how we all put such a value on superficial ideals and status. I think what this films showcases is that despite failing never give up, even if you fail again. That you don't always have to be the best at something not to have great value.  To let pure love lead our lives,  minds, and hearts. That children don't have to be a star athlete or a next American Idol..to be considered a great gift that should be honored and not abused or taken on lightly.I truly love this film greatly.

1488051,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B005LAIIKS,Sean Pasek,"[1, 1]","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I have always loved movies that challenge the idea of ""being normal""; that challenge the idea that conformity is the way to go.  ""Dead Poets Society"" was a movie aimed at teens and young adults.  ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" targets parents.  The beauty of this film is that the parents are not learning from other adults or parents, but from a child.  Everyone is different in some way.  And it is these differences that our society and the world, tend to frown upon rather than celebrate.Timothy Green wears his heart and his wisdom on his sleeve.  One of the things that you will quickly note about Timothy is that he really doesn't care what anyone thinks of him.  He is being himself to the best of his ability.  It is funny because this is something that we are all trying to do.Jim and Cindy Green are devastated when they are given news that they will never be able to bear children of their own.  It's a depressing night when they come back from the doctor's.  It is plainly obvious that a huge dream is shattered for both of them.  In an attempt to find some way to reconcile themselves to the news, Jim comes up with an idea of writing down the traits/abilities that their ""perfect"" child would have or be able to do.  On small sheets of notebook paper, they soon take delight in mapping out their ideal child.  They put the pieces of paper into a cigar box and bury it in out in the garden.  A lightning storm comes along, and here comes Timothy Green with green leaves on his legs (you might take note that each leaf is in the shape of a heart!).  This is one of those films where you just have to cast conventional wisdom aside.  Try not to question too many things, or you will lose touch with the magic of the film.  After all, magic isn't magic if you question it or want an explanation about how it was done.  You just need to appreciate it.Pretty soon, Timothy is quickly introduced to family and friends.  As he begins to perform the various things from the list, he loses a leaf from his leg.  Of course, this doesn't become aware to Jim and Cindy until the end when Timothy gives them his last pearl of wisdom.The irony about Timothy and the things that he does according to the list, is that each is done in his own way.  In other words, he does his best even if the results are not what Jim or Cindy have envisioned.  A soccer match demonstrates this beautifully.Timothy is talented and yet odd.  But, he has a magic within him that only a handful of people seem to appreciate.  His parents and his best friend Joni, a girl with her own secret to share.  The beauty of Timothy is that he is happy with who he is.  He doesn't try to be anything else.  And while Timothy doesn't become hurt or upset about what others think of him, the same can't be said about Jim and Cindy.  This is part of the wisdom that Timothy hopes to pass on to them.As adults, we tend to bring our hurts and scars of our childhood with us.  We remember those hurts.  We still feel them.  And so, as parents, we do our absolute best to shield and protect our children from having to experience the same thing.  The funny part about Timothy is that this protection is not necessary.  And it takes some time before Jim and Cindy understand that they don't have to protect him from ridicule.The performances in this film are outstanding.  Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton make the perfect couple.  They have great on-screen chemistry with each other as well as with CJ Adams, the child-actor who turns in a masterful performance as Timothy.  CJ's smile alone will melt your heart.Some people have complained that this film is too sugary and melodramatic.  I disagree.  It has a terrific balance of light humor and feeling without becoming heavy.  Children and parents alike can watch and enjoy this film.  In fact, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" should be required viewing for parents and children alike, as everyone can learn a little something about themselves.Parents aren't perfect, and the best wisdom we can pass on to our children is to appreciate your differences because they are part of what makes you unique; they are part of what makes you who you are.So, if you're in the mood for a warm-hearted film that will leave you smiling after, then you really can't go wrong with this film.",4,Being Odd and Different Means to Be Yourself!,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,4317,"['***POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS***I', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'movies', 'challenge', 'idea', 'being', 'normal', 'challenge', 'idea', 'conformity', 'way', 'go', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'was', 'movie', 'aimed', 'teens', 'young', 'adults', 'Odd', 'Life', 'Timothy', 'Green', 'parents', 'beauty', 'film', 'parents', 'are', 'not', 'learning', 'other', 'adults', 'parents', 'child', 'Everyone', 'different', 'way', 'differences', 'society', 'world', 'tend', 'frown', 'rather', 'celebrate.Timothy', 'Green', 'wears', 'heart', 'wisdom', 'sleeve', 'One', 'things', 'will', 'quickly', 'note', 'Timothy', 'really', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'being', 'best', 'ability', 'funny', 'something', 'are', 'trying', 'do.Jim', 'Cindy', 'Green', 'are', 'devastated', 'when', 'are', 'given', 'news', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'bear', 'children', 'own', 'depressing', 'night', 'when', 'come', 'back', 'doctor', 'plainly', 'obvious', 'huge', 'dream', 'shattered', 'attempt', 'find', 'way', 'reconcile', 'news', 'Jim', 'up', 'idea', 'writing', 'down', 'traits/abilities', 'perfect', 'child', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'small', 'sheets', 'notebook', 'paper', 'soon', 'take', 'delight', 'mapping', 'out', 'ideal', 'child', 'put', 'pieces', 'paper', 'cigar', 'box', 'bury', 'out', 'garden', 'lightning', 'storm', 'along', 'here', 'Timothy', 'Green', 'green', 'leaves', 'legs', 'might', 'take', 'note', 'leaf', 'shape', 'heart', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'just', 'have', 'cast', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'aside', 'Try', 'not', 'question', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'will', 'lose', 'touch', 'magic', 'film', 'magic', ""n't"", 'magic', 'question', 'want', 'explanation', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'just', 'need', 'appreciate', 'it.Pretty', 'soon', 'Timothy', 'quickly', 'introduced', 'family', 'friends', 'perform', 'various', 'things', 'list', 'leaf', 'leg', 'course', ""n't"", 'become', 'aware', 'Jim', 'Cindy', 'end', 'when', 'Timothy', 'last', 'pearl', 'wisdom.The', 'irony', 'Timothy', 'things', 'according', 'list', 'done', 'own', 'way', 'other', 'words', 'best', 'even', 'results', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'Jim', 'Cindy', 'have', 'envisioned', 'soccer', 'match', 'beautifully.Timothy', 'talented', 'yet', 'odd', 'magic', 'only', 'handful', 'people', 'seem', 'appreciate', 'parents', 'best', 'friend', 'Joni', 'girl', 'own', 'secret', 'share', 'beauty', 'Timothy', 'happy', 'who', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'anything', 'else', 'Timothy', ""n't"", 'become', 'hurt', 'upset', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'Jim', 'Cindy', 'part', 'wisdom', 'Timothy', 'pass', 'them.As', 'adults', 'tend', 'bring', 'hurts', 'scars', 'childhood', 'remember', 'hurts', 'still', 'feel', 'so', 'parents', 'do', 'absolute', 'best', 'shield', 'protect', 'children', 'having', 'experience', 'same', 'thing', 'funny', 'part', 'Timothy', 'protection', 'not', 'necessary', 'time', 'Jim', 'Cindy', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'protect', 'ridicule.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'make', 'perfect', 'couple', 'have', 'great', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'CJ', 'Adams', 'child-actor', 'who', 'masterful', 'performance', 'Timothy', 'CJ', 'smile', 'alone', 'will', 'melt', 'heart.Some', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'too', 'sugary', 'melodramatic', 'disagree', 'terrific', 'balance', 'light', 'humor', 'feeling', 'becoming', 'heavy', 'Children', 'parents', 'alike', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'film', 'fact', 'Odd', 'Life', 'Timothy', 'Green', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'parents', 'children', 'alike', 'everyone', 'can', 'learn', 'little', 'something', 'themselves.Parents', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'best', 'wisdom', 'can', 'pass', 'children', 'appreciate', 'differences', 'are', 'part', 'what', 'unique', 'are', 'part', 'what', 'who', 'are.So', ""'re"", 'mood', 'warm-hearted', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'smiling', 'then', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'film']",The Odd Life of Timothy Green

No castles, Death Stars, or Quidditch tournaments, just a gentle story told effectively.A happily married childless couple, Cindy and Jim Green (Jennifer Garner, Joel Edgerton) become frustrated with their inability to conceive, so one night they dream up their ideal offspring and write the child's characteristics and life events on pieces of paper.  They place the notes in a box and bury it in their backyard.  One stormy night, a muddy ten-year-old arrives at their doorstep, claiming the Greens as his own.  Cindy and Jim, along with their small town of Stanleyville, learn that sometimes the unexpected can bring some of life's greatest gifts.""He's a boy with the qualities that his parents hope for,"" says director Peter Hedges, but ""those qualities manifest in ways they never could have imagined.""  The Greens get exactly what they wished for.  Timothy doesn't have any emotional memories and he's completely naive about how the world works.The title role puts spotlight on young actor CJ Adams, whom Hedges cast in 2007's ""Dan In Real Life.""  What initially appears to be a kids' film isn't actually about childhood.  It's more a fable about the sadness of infertility and the joy of parenthood with its accompanying highs and lows.  It often veers into saccharine sentimentality, but is well-intentioned at heart.The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack's bonus extras include deleted scenes, director's commentary, a making-of featurette, and the music video ""This Gift.""

It hovers on the edge of saccharine, without ever quite going over.It starts at the other end of the emotional spectrum, though. Jim and Cindy, desperate to be parents, confront the heartbreak of their infertility. They face it stoically enough - but let themselves wallow in their wishes one last time before setting them aside. The magic comes when their wishes come true, in the form of a smiling and mud-smeared boy. From that point on, it's rampant feel-goodism. Jim squares issues with his father, Cindy ends the competition with her sister, and Timothy works wonders for a girl about his own age (played by Odeya Rush, who might resemble Anne Hathaway as an early teen). There's some sadness near the end, but Timothy's Zen-like calm and and quiet joy keep that from being too dark.As with any fairy tale, this requires suspension of disbelief. Wouldn't anyone ask questions when a small boy appears from nowhere? Or when he  vanishes again? Would the stony-faced bureaucrats at the end actually yield that easily?
