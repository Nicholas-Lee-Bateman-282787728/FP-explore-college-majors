The picture and sound quality are great, considering the technology at the time it was originally produced.  This show is a classic that rates right up there with the old Jimmy Stewart and Fred MacMurray movies.  The younger generations may not appreciate this series, but that will be their loss.",5,I've waited a long time for this  to be released on DVD.,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,402,"['THANK', 'YOU', 'Shout', 'Factory', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'years', 'classic', 't.v', 'series', 'finally', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'great', 'considering', 'technology', 'time', 'was', 'originally', 'produced', 'show', 'classic', 'rates', 'right', 'there', 'old', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'movies', 'younger', 'generations', 'may', 'not', 'appreciate', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'loss']",The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis: Season 1
1654380,A2IYTNAMLR5TJR,B00D97DMQU,Don McGregor,"[1, 2]","I like the fact that SHOUT! releases classic TV Series like Dobie as complete sets, all the seasons collected in one brightly designed box, and the company actually has begun practicing a reverse approach to the more or less established way of selling an individual season, seeing how the show does before committing to putting another season out for the collectors. If you love a series, and you want every season, there's a cliff-hanger element added, because, Hey! You never know if the company will continue or just abruptly abandon it. The question can linger for months, even years, if the show will ever be available in its entirety on DVD.As a storyteller I also love that being able to view every episode over a passage of time means that I can see how a series like Dobie evolves, from conception and then from season to season. In this set you really can discover the shifting in tone in Dobie Gillis. I would have sworn before viewing these in this newly released DVD set that Dobie's father's angry/energetic/exasperated/sometimes a forlorn lament: &#34;I gotta kill that boy!&#34; ran through the course of all four seasons of Dobie, but it doesn't. He only pitches the line at the departing Dobie in the first season.I suspect, as iconic as the line became for the series, someone behind the scenes decided that it was too harsh a litany to use week after week, from a father to a son, and that Herbert D. Gillis had to be mellowed down a bit, and their familial relationship not as dysfunctional.See, you could not realize that if you only had the first season.Or watch a performer come in for what may have been a one-shot episode, and so captured the writers and/or producers and/or the audience that half a season later that person becomes a full-fledged member of the supporting cast.The neat thing about this release approach by SHOUT! is that after they make the complete sets available, they then release them as single season sets. Now, if you're only interested in a particular season, you only have to buy that one. Or if the completed sets are too expensive, and you can only afford one at the time, you can also still have episodes from the series.The entire RIDING SHOTGUN column with clips from DOBIE GILLIS is up on COMICS BULLETIN.If you enjoy this part of the Dobie piece, I suspect you'll find the clips and comic book cover reproductionfun.  Check it out.  Don McGregor",5,"Dobie Gillis: ""I Gotta Kill that Boy!""
