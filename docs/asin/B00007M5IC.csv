731923,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00007M5IC,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 3]","""Max Magician and the Legend of the Rings"" is a hilariously bad kids' movie that manages to rip off BOTH Lord of the Rings AND Harry Potter simultaneously. Since it was too cheesy to run in the theaters, it went straight to the bargain bins. It's got an enchanted book like The Neverending Story, but it's pretty clear the ""special effects"" were photoshopped. In fact, it was filmed on the cheap at the Renaissance Faire in Baltimore,Maryland. Pain-loving fans of the movie hold fan conventions there.""Max Magician"" opens with random elves being attacked by a guy with a red hat, which is quickly paralleled with Max getting bullied at school. Max's friend, Mr. Tim, gives him a book of magic. Max enters a portal to another world, where his pet mouse talks&he; gets invited to an elven feast with Princess Etain. Max is told repeatedly to ""believe in himself."" All he has to do is read from the book and-deus ex machina! The plot gets needlessly complicated with Max returning to the real world,Etain's necklace for Max,and THREE flashbacks involving the mystical rings that preserve the elves' sylvan realm. There's also the villain Dagda-who looks like Tim Curry's character in ""Legend"" who hisses dramatically,and his Brazilian sidekick. The ending,as is expected,is incredibly cliched.""Max Magician"" is a cult classic,in its own bizarre way. It's best paired with ""Darkon"",a thoughtful documentary about LARPers in Maryland,or ""Mazes and Monsters"",the Tom Hanks debut about the evils of D&D.; ""Max Magician"" defines EPIC FAIL.",2,Max Magician and the Rip off of the Rings,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,1531,"['Max', 'Magician', 'Legend', 'Rings', 'hilariously', 'bad', 'kids', 'movie', 'rip', 'off', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'AND', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'simultaneously', 'was', 'too', 'cheesy', 'run', 'theaters', 'went', 'straight', 'bargain', 'bins', 'got', 'enchanted', 'book', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'pretty', 'clear', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'photoshopped', 'fact', 'was', 'filmed', 'cheap', 'Renaissance', 'Faire', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', 'Pain-loving', 'fans', 'movie', 'hold', 'fan', 'conventions', 'there', 'Max', 'Magician', 'random', 'elves', 'being', 'attacked', 'guy', 'red', 'hat', 'quickly', 'paralleled', 'Max', 'getting', 'bullied', 'school', 'Max', 'friend', 'Mr.', 'Tim', 'book', 'magic', 'Max', 'portal', 'world', 'where', 'pet', 'mouse', 'talks', 'invited', 'elven', 'feast', 'Princess', 'Etain', 'Max', 'told', 'repeatedly', 'believe', 'do', 'read', 'book', 'and-deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'plot', 'needlessly', 'complicated', 'Max', 'returning', 'real', 'world', 'Etain', 'necklace', 'Max', 'THREE', 'flashbacks', 'involving', 'mystical', 'rings', 'preserve', 'elves', 'sylvan', 'realm', 'also', 'villain', 'Dagda-who', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'character', 'Legend', 'who', 'dramatically', 'Brazilian', 'sidekick', 'ending', 'expected', 'incredibly', 'cliched', 'Max', 'Magician', 'cult', 'classic', 'own', 'bizarre', 'way', 'best', 'paired', 'Darkon', 'thoughtful', 'documentary', 'LARPers', 'Maryland', 'Mazes', 'Monsters', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'debut', 'evils', 'D', 'D', 'Max', 'Magician', 'defines', 'EPIC', 'FAIL']",Max Magician and the Legend of the Rings

Check out the elf wearing tennis shoes! The top henchman who ogles everyone he talks to! The villain farting and being dissolved by mice! Elves armed with breadsticks! The foley work for people running, which consisted of hitting a bag of raw rice against a wall! The special effects done via PowerPoint! The people Max keeps in his closet! The ""army"" of FOUR PEOPLE! Everything, everything is unintentionally hilarious. In fact, I debated whether I should give this movie one star for failing as a movie or five stars for being one of the best worst movies ever made.Your kids will not be fooled. They will think this is downright stupid without fail. They will wander off, completely bored. The only way they might like it is if they are young... the 4-7-years-old kind of young. And frankly, that's too young for them to see this, since they'll become upset at all the lame elves getting lamely whacked in the back with lame foam hammers.This movie has a Special Features and Commentary section, which makes it all the stranger. How could anyone make this and not know how retarded and beyond salvageable it was? Acting, costumes, script, story, and sets were past poor. The only element that seemed halfway decent were the false faces, and even those seem like they were prosthetics stolen from the set of Lord of the Rings.You're going to hate this movie.

731928,A23VGBG17K5NJ3,B00007M5IC,John Nolley II,"[30, 31]","Do you enjoy films so poor they become unintentional comedies? Do you find yourself delivering running commentaries during movies like the cast of Mystery Science Theater 3000? Then this little stinker is perfect for you!While the film's producers likely had loftier aspirations, Max Magician is one of the funniest fantasy films ever made. From actors who play multiple parts to wonderfully corny dialog to the unintentionally hilarious character foibles, this film is worth every penny if you enjoy ""bad"" movies.The movie is chocked full of contradictions and plot holes--Max, for instance, should be the butt of every bully at school; he nearly goes to class wearing a stage magician's cape, and his parents constantly complain about his lack of friends--but he seems rather popular with the girls when he does a ""trick"" that ends up covering a bully's face with egg. Still, when your best friend is a talking mouse with attitude and you look up to ""tough"" elderly gardeners, maybe you've got worse problems than bullies.That Max's gardening pal receives a warning of great danger from a man killed delivering it doesn't stop him from sending poor Max off with nary a word of caution into a world of poorly-made-up elves (or should they be fairies based on their hodgepodge mythological references?) and sneering, laughable bad guys off doing their ""kingly things."" The plot thickens about as much as water from there...The DVD version includes a number of ""special"" (like the short bus) features, including a documentary that features the curator of Natural Bridge droning on about how wonderful it was for a movie to actually film inside caves; the gung-ho armorer demonstrating ""realistic"" war hammers looking more like croquet mallets; and repeated rehearsals of one of Max's friends cracking an egg on a bully's head.  These are nearly as funny as the film itself!The name and cover alone would disuade the fan of more serious fantasy, yet don't let that disuade you from picking this title up.

731929,A2U4E28ACJ2QPV,B00007M5IC,Josh V.H.,"[2, 3]","While I was wandering through Walmart one day, I became introduced to this movie while exploring the $5.00 bin of either old movies or rejects.  Curious, I rushed home and decided to purchase it.  My, my was I in for a surprise!First of all, the movie description states ""in the spirit of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings"".  This wasn't far from the mark as it was certainly in the spirit of these classics, just not up to their excellence level as this movie falls far, far below the mark.  Almost an insult to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings is more of a realistic attribute as this movie has no real flavor and while it could have just the hint of a potential, never really lives up to it's expectations.While the movie attempts to be a serious magical adventure film, it comes off as more of a comedy than anything else.  The acting is atrocious, watching people spew out their lines as if the director hired them straight off the street.  No real expression, no real movement, and an overly simplified dialogue, making this almost hilarious to watch as the actors either over do it or just give up trying.Possibly one of the more humorous scenes is the main bad guy, sitting in his cave fortress as he consistently says ""Bahhh"" after every line- giving the impression that he's more of a dying, disgruntled goat than anything else.  Not only that, but his army of rushing madmen takes on the appearance of a mix between a biker gang and rejected viking warriors, complete with obvious foam hammers that pound cardboard doors to splinters!  Lead by their insidious leader who constantly argues with the main villian on how to execute plans.To further add to this awesome adventure gone terribly wrong, the door keeper to the city is an older woman/ man type thing who constantly rhymes everything they say.  Honestly, I have not felt as much need to conduct physical violence on a movie character before until they stepped onto the screen, spewing the useless and unwitty dialogue in an attempt to make the movie appear childlike and enjoyable.  Oh it certainly was enjoyable all right, just not in the way it was intended.The film was clearly low budget as the same woman plays two different characters: the mom and the elf queen.  The relationships between the characters were shabby to say the least and the filming was pretty much done with a normal camera.  In fact the disappearance of this grand army of knights in the end, which by the way turned out to be about 4, was using the age old trick of stopping the film with them in it, then shooting a picture with them not in it next.  A tactic that any person with a video camera can conduct.So, all in all, a very tactless movie.  I gave it two stars since they tried and made it more humorous than what it was intended to be.  Also, the elf king in the movie wasn't an overly terrible actor.  Not an oscar winner by any means but still better than practically all of the cast in this movie.  So, if you want a heroic fantasy movie that you and your friends can laugh at as you watch the poor acting and filming, this movie is for you!  If not, then I would invest in the actual Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies.",2,A heroic fantasy tale gone comedy!,1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,3187,"['was', 'wandering', 'Walmart', 'one', 'day', 'became', 'introduced', 'movie', 'exploring', '5.00', 'bin', 'old', 'movies', 'rejects', 'Curious', 'rushed', 'home', 'decided', 'purchase', 'My', 'was', 'surprise', 'First', 'all', 'movie', 'description', 'spirit', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', ""n't"", 'far', 'mark', 'was', 'certainly', 'spirit', 'classics', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'excellence', 'level', 'movie', 'far', 'far', 'mark', 'Almost', 'insult', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'more', 'realistic', 'attribute', 'movie', 'real', 'flavor', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'hint', 'potential', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'movie', 'be', 'serious', 'magical', 'adventure', 'film', 'off', 'more', 'comedy', 'anything', 'else', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'watching', 'people', 'spew', 'out', 'lines', 'director', 'hired', 'straight', 'off', 'street', 'real', 'expression', 'real', 'movement', 'overly', 'simplified', 'dialogue', 'making', 'almost', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'actors', 'over', 'do', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'trying.Possibly', 'one', 'more', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'sitting', 'cave', 'fortress', 'consistently', 'Bahhh', 'line-', 'giving', 'impression', 'more', 'dying', 'disgruntled', 'goat', 'anything', 'else', 'Not', 'only', 'army', 'rushing', 'madmen', 'appearance', 'mix', 'biker', 'gang', 'rejected', 'viking', 'warriors', 'complete', 'obvious', 'foam', 'hammers', 'pound', 'cardboard', 'doors', 'splinters', 'Lead', 'insidious', 'leader', 'who', 'constantly', 'main', 'villian', 'how', 'execute', 'plans.To', 'further', 'add', 'awesome', 'adventure', 'gone', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'door', 'keeper', 'city', 'older', 'woman/', 'man', 'type', 'thing', 'who', 'constantly', 'everything', 'say', 'Honestly', 'have', 'not', 'felt', 'much', 'need', 'conduct', 'physical', 'violence', 'movie', 'character', 'stepped', 'screen', 'spewing', 'useless', 'unwitty', 'dialogue', 'attempt', 'make', 'movie', 'appear', 'childlike', 'enjoyable', 'certainly', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'all', 'right', 'just', 'not', 'way', 'was', 'intended.The', 'film', 'was', 'clearly', 'low', 'budget', 'same', 'woman', 'two', 'different', 'characters', 'mom', 'elf', 'queen', 'relationships', 'characters', 'were', 'shabby', 'say', 'least', 'filming', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'done', 'normal', 'camera', 'fact', 'disappearance', 'grand', 'army', 'knights', 'end', 'way', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'about', '4', 'was', 'using', 'age', 'old', 'trick', 'stopping', 'film', 'then', 'shooting', 'picture', 'not', 'next', 'tactic', 'person', 'video', 'camera', 'can', 'conduct.So', 'very', 'tactless', 'movie', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'tried', 'made', 'more', 'humorous', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'Also', 'elf', 'king', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'terrible', 'actor', 'Not', 'oscar', 'winner', 'means', 'still', 'better', 'practically', 'cast', 'movie', 'So', 'want', 'heroic', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'friends', 'can', 'laugh', 'watch', 'poor', 'acting', 'filming', 'movie', 'not', 'then', 'would', 'invest', 'actual', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies']",Max Magician and the Legend of the Rings

731931,A2JHYW5V7UFIQ2,B00007M5IC,"R. C. Walker ""catu11us""","[11, 12]","The ""let's make a cheap (CHEAP) fantasy film"" industry has over the years managed to generate at least as much bad acting as old westerns, 1930s-40s serials, Ed Wood films, and porn that aspires to plot lines.  And it must be observed that Charles Middleton and Harry Reems (e.g.) could display some slight modicum of the thespian muse -- of which in this mutt of a film there isn't the slightest trace.Imagine an average High School English class, slogging through a Shakespeare play by reading the parts and hating them.  No, the acting here isn't that bad -- it's worse.  The impression can't be avoided that that --um, ""performers"" in this film were selected based precisely on their inability to register emotion.  We will dispense with the usual listing of the (understandably unknown) names in order to protect the guilty.Overall, ""Max Magician"" is unusually derivative, unimaginative, and overwritten, even for a 3-day-wonder very-low-budget fantasy film.  The situations that occur are frequently contrived to the point of absurdity and with an eye toward cheap melodrama.The plot, such as it is, involves a kid named Max who has difficulties with a school bully (how original!) and is a not untalented amateur magician.  He's given an obviously ancient book of (real) magic spells by an elderly neighbor, with the advice to ""believe in yourself"".  Nobody ever explains what this means, but in every crisis the kid has somebody (a mouse or a hawk or whatever) yelling this generic bit of street-corner philosophy at him.Max uses the book to enter a fantasy world in which there is a developing struggle between elves, trolls, and other inmates of your usual $5-per-CD role-playing game.  A deus-ex-machina wizard shows up to teach him to use the spells in his book whilst dispensing platitudinous advice that makes Polonius look like a sage.Max uses his newfound magic to assist the elves and their friends against the evil troll king (or whatever he is with the ostentatious horns on his head).  Max's late confrontation with the latter doesn't amount to much but is nonetheless decisive.  The ""rings"" of the title are a direct steal in basic concept from Tolkien, but have neither a legend nor a significant role to play in the film.  In the end there is another confrontation between Max and the bully -- which, however, is unsatisfactorily indecisive.I wish I could tell you that ""Max Magician"" has some redeeming feature or features.  Alas.  While the print used on the DVD is quite clear, it only serves to emphasize how cheesy the ""magic"" effects (such as they are) appear.  Oddly, the makeup isn't all that bad, although elf ears are no more convincing than convention-issue Spock ears.  Special effects are minimal and are generally foggy and sparkly effects superimposed on the film.  The script, including the mandatory bwa-ha-ha-has from the chief bad guy, lurches from banality to banality.I don't recommend this film, even for children.
