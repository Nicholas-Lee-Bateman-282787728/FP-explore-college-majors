Just put them in front of a video camera and watch their eyes glaze over with dreams of becoming rich and famous movie stars. My guess is these girls got their jobs only after a visit to the acting couch. Such is the reality of Hollywood. Oh well, at least they had their 15 minutes of fame. Unfortunately this movie is a total waste of time unless you're just looking for some boobs to ogle. You can fast-forward to find those parts. There is no story to speak of so it's not like you'll be missing much after skipping ten minutes or so.

Espinosa ""The Onlooker""","[4, 5]","Let me start off by saying that this same movie is available at Cinemanow for downloading for under $4, (buying to own option). It seems that Cinemanow is aware on the piece of junk this film is so they valued it properly. If you spent or are willing to spend more than fifteen bucks on DVD version, well, that's your choice.This is a kind of amateur, made-for-DVD only garbage that could perfectly be on YouTube these days (you will occasionally find better things in there). The storyline is so silly (a pair of girlfriends that come all the way to Malibu from Arizona to have a party like an animal and ends up screwing everything up in the end) that it seems it was written by a teenager. The production is so poor that it seems that the entire movie was made by the use of personal camcorders. In brief: this movie was made just for the fun of it, so don't expect a masterpiece. So, from a man's standpoint, the only two stars I give on this review goes to the ""actresses"", who in terms of acting, have a nice body...",2,Ugh!
