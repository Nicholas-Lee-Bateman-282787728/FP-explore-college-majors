570911,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000056V6H,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Whatever your feelings about Book of Shadows, you have to admit that the guys behind the Blair Witch phenomenon are very good marketers.  This box set is a terrific value.  I already owned the Blair Witch Project on VHS, so I would probably never have purchased the DVD; in terms of the sequel, I was hesitant about going for the DVD rather than the VHS version based on the reviews I had read.  I would never have bought the computer games.  Thanks to this package, I now have all of the above (along with a trivial but not uncool stickman necklace).  If you are any kind of Blair Witch fan, you need to buy this set.As for the original Blair Witch disc, its main attraction is the movie commentary.  Despite the fact that there are half a dozen or more people doing the commentary, it is very interesting, and it provides you with some insight and facts about the movie and how it was really made (you even find out what Heather was seeing when the trio ran away from the tent screaming that one night).  Sadly, you won't find any extra scenes included here than were available on the VHS version; this is doubly disappointing because the commentators make comments on a number of occasions about cut scenes they hoped would make it on the DVD).As for the sequel, it wasn't all that bad.  It wasn't all that great either.  As the movie started, I thought that it could turn out to be a pretty good story; that promise faded as the movie progressed.  One thing that annoyed me was the fact that the movie took place, for the most part, inside of one building.  The characters headed out into the woods on a Blair Witch tour, but we never see those woods during the second half of the movie.  Just before the movie ended, I got that old feeling that says &quot;I hope they don't end the movie at this point in the story,&quot; and--of course--that is what immediately happened.  Still, it's very watchable and far from horrible.  You do get a bonus with the Book of Shadows DVD; the flip side of the disc contains four songs along with the score from the movie in regular CD format.  Supposedly, this is the first such DVD+CD product to be released--I don't know how impressed I should be over that.Bottom line: if you don't have the Blair Witch Project on DVD, it would behoove you to buy this set.",4,Value of Package Outweighs Lameness of Sequel,989020800,"05 5, 2001",2001,2299,"['feelings', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'have', 'admit', 'guys', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'phenomenon', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'marketers', 'box', 'set', 'terrific', 'value', 'already', 'owned', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'VHS', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'have', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'terms', 'sequel', 'was', 'hesitant', 'going', 'DVD', 'rather', 'VHS', 'version', 'based', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'bought', 'computer', 'games', 'Thanks', 'package', 'now', 'have', 'above', 'trivial', 'not', 'uncool', 'stickman', 'necklace', 'are', 'kind', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'fan', 'need', 'buy', 'set.As', 'original', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'disc', 'main', 'attraction', 'movie', 'commentary', 'fact', 'are', 'dozen', 'more', 'people', 'doing', 'commentary', 'very', 'interesting', 'insight', 'facts', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'really', 'made', 'even', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Heather', 'was', 'seeing', 'when', 'trio', 'ran', 'away', 'tent', 'screaming', 'one', 'night', 'Sadly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'extra', 'scenes', 'included', 'here', 'were', 'available', 'VHS', 'version', 'doubly', 'disappointing', 'commentators', 'make', 'comments', 'number', 'occasions', 'cut', 'scenes', 'hoped', 'would', 'make', 'DVD', '.As', 'sequel', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'either', 'movie', 'started', 'thought', 'could', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'promise', 'faded', 'movie', 'progressed', 'One', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'was', 'fact', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'most', 'part', 'one', 'building', 'characters', 'headed', 'out', 'woods', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'tour', 'never', 'see', 'woods', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'Just', 'movie', 'ended', 'got', 'old', 'feeling', 'quot', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'movie', 'point', 'story', 'quot', 'course', 'what', 'immediately', 'happened', 'Still', 'very', 'watchable', 'far', 'horrible', 'do', 'get', 'bonus', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'DVD', 'flip', 'side', 'disc', 'four', 'songs', 'score', 'movie', 'regular', 'CD', 'format', 'Supposedly', 'first', 'such', 'DVD+CD', 'product', 'be', 'released', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'impressed', 'should', 'be', 'that.Bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'DVD', 'would', 'behoove', 'buy', 'set']",The Blair Witch Experience Collection Set

570914,A7Y6AVS576M03,B000056V6H,gobirds2,"[0, 1]","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was an interesting independent film that really had an innovative idea. However that idea fizzled after about 20 minutes into it for a few reasons. This was due mainly to the very obnoxious behavior of the would-be adventurers who set out on this supposed ghost hunt. These adolescents use four letter words in such a preponderance of pseudo intellectual ineptitude that I was hopping that they would all just vanish without a trace. They are the crudest, asinine and most repugnant characters I have seen in film for some time. Are we really supposed to care what happens to them? This is a film aimed at the teenage market. Are parents supposed to let their children be exposed to this offensive material? This film could have been presented without the use of the four lettered words, but I suppose the filmmakers would find that not politically correct. That was then. Looking back, I see some good film techniques that make it unique. It captured a certain look and it actually reminded me of Dudleytown, which is a ghost town in Cornwall, Connecticut. I was there three times when the public could walk through. To its credit, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJRCT did capture something that was definitely a bit unsettling walking through the forest that is now Dudleytown. BLAIR WITCH 2: BOOK OF SHADOWS makes me ask a question. Is this really a sequel? I thought the original was nothing that special. The main characters were so insensitive with their self assured arrogance I do not see how anyone could have cared what happened to them. So why make a sequel. However it does not even look like a sequel. It looks more like a spin-off of a mediocre TV show, a very strained effort to come up with a second film.

Sinply this movies has a great story, very different and unique and definitely better than the Blair Witch 1. The knockout punch is it puts an original spin on the late 90's teen squeal series of Scream, Urban Legends, I Know What You Did Last Summer film genres and conversly puts them to shame. Extending on it's modern/future day society insights, one of the characters said he made money from ebay. I can relate to him as it's such a techno savvy and new age word to use. It extended on the original Blair Witch dvd commentary where the directors sold there camera on ebay...Though that's where the similarities end as 'Book Of Shadows' is not your standard home video camera farce. All in all it uses more sophisticated plot devices, well constructed dialogue and usual plethora of expensive camera angles. On top of that the DVD features comprehensive and value for money special features. Turn the DVD over and you have a CD album soundtrack which is not your standard low volume, classical score type: it's more a sonice band composition. Well worth using the DVD ROM for it has a full size script during the movie.

I didn't find it as scary as everyone else.  I found it to bevery...anticlimactic.  They kept trying to build up suspense over and over, but very little actually happened!  Iwas actually bored by Blair Witch by the very end.Not so with part two.

I have the answer. STUPIDITY. I bet every person who went and saw the first movie went and saw the second one just out of morbid curiosity to see if it explained ANYTHING. I am guilty of this. My figuring was, ""Hell, it can't get much worse than the first one..."" Oh, was I wrong. The whole premise of the movie was this guy has this ""tour"" of the woods where the Blair Witch kids ""died."" The main characters are, The tour guy, the documentary couple, the wiccan, and of course there had to be a goth chick. What did you expect? Anyway. These people go shopping for booze and food and tromp into the woods and nothing really happens...or so they thought. This should have been my first clue to up and leave. Then out of nowhere the girl in the ""couple"" has a miscarriage and they rush to the hospital and she starts seeing this little girl. Oh. Yeah. They also got their equipment damaged and then found the tapes where the other tapes were in the ground. Sorry. After that, they go back to the tour guys house and that's where it gets ""scary."" Weird stuff starts happening, the girl in the couple starts going insane and they just happen to find that on the tapes they find some missing hours where they killed the people on the other tour and, I dunno, had some orgy-ish magic ritual? So. The wiccan goes missing and blah blah blah. In the end they thought the girl in the couple was the Blair Witch or something and kill her and then they get taken to jail and then come to find that they killed her when she was ""sane"" and that they also killed the Wiccan.

570930,A1COQ2DOO1O9HD,B000056V6H,Wing J. Flanagan,"[6, 7]","I found this set in the bargain bin.  It was inexpensive enough, so I bought it, being a fan of the original Blair Witch Project (and also coming from Orlando, like the film-makers), and having no idea what the sequel was like -- other than most people said it stank up the joint.The set is a mixed bag.  Despite some genuine hackle-raising moments (when the video camera is hunting in the dark and we hear, for God's sake LAUGHING CHILDREN in the woods), the original Blair Witch is uneven, with the improvised dialog occasionally backfiring.  There are moments when the spell breaks and we can tell that the actors are self-consciously going for moments, rather than remaining immersed in their characters. But these are quibbles.  The Blair Witch Project remains a stunning acheivement if for no other reason than its sheer audacity.  The nerve of these guys, Myreck and Sanchez.  The chutzpah.  I admire it.Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows is almost a good movie, and probably would have been, were it not for idiot studio bean-counters A) rushing the production (soup to nuts in ONE year), and B) interfering with the creative process.  Listen to director Joe Berlinger's somewhat pained commentary track and you'll understand what I mean.  His intent (which probably would have worked), was to go for a subversive, darkly satiric take on the so-called &quot;Blair Witch phenomenon&quot; and its subsequent backlash, while at the same time making a genuine psychological thriller on the nature of evil (human? occult? a mixture of both? he wanted it ambiguous).Alas, while creative people and thoughtful film-goers like philosophical ambiguity, studio bosses don't.  So they made him dumb it down.  Berlinger is a gifted documentarian who should have been allowed, for his first feature film, to exercise his creative muscles in the realm of a fictional narrative.  As it stands, a lot of carefully modulated effects are placed out of their original sequence.  Only a viewing of his original cut would tell us if they would have worked better as originally conceived, but as it stands, Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows, is a noble ruin -- a film with some very good ideas that are not allowed to get very far.  It's a shame.The DVDs are chock-full of extras, including some nifty puzzles and creepy, hidden images.
