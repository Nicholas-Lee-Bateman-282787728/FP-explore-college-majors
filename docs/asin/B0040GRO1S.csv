Season seven (7) was NOT disappointing to me, as a long time fan of ""waking the Dead"", in the least.The two (2) episodes in two (2) parts on each of the three (3) discs in Season Seven (7), as always, were highly intense  and  with unforeseen, by me, outcomes.  I really enjoyed season seven (7) of ""Waking the Dead"" finding it so very well acted, written and directed.The leader of the Investigative team of ""cold cases"" that usually have tie-ins with current murders is DSI Boyd (brilliantly acted by Trevor Eve) who is particularly cranky, short-tempered and bossy this season mainly due to the appearance of his ""long lost"" son.  Thank god, Grace (wonderfully acted by Sue Johnston) is on hand to calm and to ""ground"" him.  His ""support"" team consisting of a pathologist (she's very astute with a  severe smokeing habit)  and two (2) other investigators (both greatly acted; with hunky Spence, wonderfully acted by Wil Johnson, being a standout) all of them are not afraid to show their expertise in their field and often go ""toe to toe"" in disagreements with their leader--certainly that is one of the reasons that I have always loved this very fine British Murder/mystery series.All-in-all, I really enjoyed Season Seven (7) of BBC's ""Waking the dead"" (there are some really nasty cases involving horrific murders,terrorism, brutal Neo-Nazis, racism, many war-time atrocities, severed heads,  Aids, child abuse, homophobia,  etc.)  I truly found each episode very exciting and mysterious  putting me ""on the edge of my seat"".  By the way, Season Seven (7) has a very emotional ending.",5,Not disappointed in the least,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1699,"['writers', 'board', 'have', 'expressed', 'disappointments', 'Season', 'seven', '7', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'Season', 'seven', '7', 'was', 'NOT', 'disappointing', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'waking', 'Dead', 'least.The', 'two', '2', 'episodes', 'two', '2', 'parts', 'three', '3', 'discs', 'Season', 'Seven', '7', 'always', 'were', 'highly', 'intense', 'unforeseen', 'outcomes', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'seven', '7', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'finding', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'written', 'directed.The', 'leader', 'Investigative', 'team', 'cold', 'cases', 'usually', 'have', 'tie-ins', 'current', 'murders', 'DSI', 'Boyd', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'who', 'particularly', 'cranky', 'short-tempered', 'bossy', 'season', 'mainly', 'due', 'appearance', 'long', 'lost', 'son', 'Thank', 'god', 'Grace', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'Sue', 'Johnston', 'hand', 'calm', 'ground', 'support', 'team', 'consisting', 'pathologist', 'very', 'astute', 'severe', 'smokeing', 'habit', 'two', '2', 'other', 'investigators', 'greatly', 'acted', 'hunky', 'Spence', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'Wil', 'Johnson', 'being', 'standout', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'expertise', 'field', 'often', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'disagreements', 'leader', 'certainly', 'one', 'reasons', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'very', 'fine', 'British', 'Murder/mystery', 'series.All-in-all', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Season', 'Seven', '7', 'BBC', 'Waking', 'dead', 'are', 'really', 'nasty', 'cases', 'involving', 'horrific', 'murders', 'terrorism', 'brutal', 'Neo-Nazis', 'racism', 'many', 'war-time', 'atrocities', 'severed', 'heads', 'Aids', 'child', 'abuse', 'homophobia', 'etc', 'truly', 'found', 'episode', 'very', 'exciting', 'mysterious', 'putting', 'edge', 'seat', 'way', 'Season', 'Seven', '7', 'very', 'emotional', 'ending']",N/A

1379246,A16XRPF40679KG,B0040GRO1S,Michael Dobey,"[0, 0]","Trevor eve and the rest of the cast do it again. With another fine season. His performance is emmy worthy , especially when the subplot of his drug addict son enfolds over this season. It's one of the worst things that can happen to a parent after all having your kid on dope.  Every story in this series is good , however the episodes dealing with the military unit are rather offensive. They are extremely anti military and they ridicule the very nature of the service.  So you might want to skip those two episodes on disc two.  The show lasted two more seasons and had strong ratings up until the end.  But execs wanted newer shows and didn't care about the ratings.  So at least we have this season on dvd for us to enjoy. This season was from 2008 , the year the worlds economy melted down,  to put that year into context.  The stories were as good as usual.  And the dvd looks great.  If you haven't watched this internationally acclaimed show then start at the first season. But you could start at this one and enjoy it just as much. the picture is really good on this set as it was shot in hd.
