190700,A1W7JW829H45AE,1573627186,"Charles M. Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[5, 5]","I've had a VHS copy of ""Jacknife"" for many years, and just recently decided to upgrade to the dvd version, now that one is available. Nothing too special about the dvd, though it is a good enough transfer, but this is one little-known movie that fans of dramatic acting will want to have in their home dvd collection. I've been slowly writing reviews to this site about my favorite movies over the years, and after watching ""Jacknife"" again last night, felt like I needed to offer this review.""Jacknife"" first came out, to almost no notice or popular acclaim, in 1989. I certainly didn't hear about it when it was first released, and only discovered it by chance, many years later, when I bought my VHS copy. Directed by David Hugh Jones, this is a short (102 minute long) but dramatic tour-de-force by 3 actors, each at the top of their game- and the result is a truly remarkable and quite unforgettable film. Based on a screenplay (written for the stage) by Stephen Metcalfe called ""Strange Snow"", and interestingly originally designed as a star vehicle for Jeff Bridges, the story details a Viet Nam vet ( Joseph Meggesey, aka ""Meggs"", aka ""Jacknife"") played by the incomparable Robert DeNiro, who looks up an old war vet buddy (David- in one of Ed Harris' best roles)after they have both returned from the war. Meggs, we find out early on, is honoring a promise made between 3 best friends, who all went to Viet Nam together, to get together for a fishing trip when they returned home. Unfortunately, and at the very heart of the story, the third buddy, Bobby Buckman (a brief screen role for Tom Isbell) did not return from the war. We gradually find out (and no real spoilers here) that Bobby died in an attempt to save Meggs life during a typical Viet Nam firefight, and Dave is harboring a lot of guilt over that event, but for reasons a bit more complex than we are first shown. Dave clearly doesn't want Meggs around initially, though Meggs irrepressible personality immediately fascinates and endears him to Dave's sister Martha (a brilliant acting role by Kathy Baker). Martha, you see, is a self-acknowledged spinster, taking care of the alcoholic, aimless Dave, as they live together in their parent's old home- unable/unwilling to break from their pasts, though for many different, complex reasons. I won't detail the entire storyline, except to say the rest of the story deals with these three characters (Meggs, Dave, and Martha), as they come to grips with each of their past demons, and their individual (and ultimately shared) efforts to deal with their grief.This movie is set in the context of the Viet Nam War, but ultimately it's a story about how human beings manage to overcome any deep, personal loss. The power of the movie rests in both the intelligent, moving screenplay, and most of all the consummate acting performances by the three principal characters. For a small-scale story, as both a character study and a profoundly moving message about the human condition, ""Jacknife"" might well be the best dramatic movie I've ever seen. There are only a few, brief flashbacks scenes with any war action in them, just enough to allow us to understand what's behind Meggs' and Dave's ongoing struggles- so I really wouldn't strictly classify this as a ""Viet Nam"" movie.....perhaps not really even a ""war movie"" at all. The power in the story rests in the much smaller human battles, waged within the hearts of Meggs, Dave, and Martha.Robert DeNiro may well be the finest dramatic actor of this generation. I used to think he was somewhat type-cast, though....you know, the Martin Scorcese ""tough guy with a New York back-street accent"", but this little-known role of his will astound you with the dramatic range and power of his acting. He is totally immersed in the Meggs character, and you'll remember the character long after the credits have rolled. First presented in this movie as a stereotypical ""Viet Nam nut case"", he emerges as a rather complex human being, filled with pathos and heart-felt soul. It's a memorable performance, and I personally rate it as one of his best, in his long and distinguished career.Kathy Baker is also perfect as the spinster who gradually (but not unbelievably, I might add) blossoms under the attentions of Meggs. She plays a realistically quirky character, unused to the attentions of men, but with a deep and caring heart for her seemingly aimless brother Dave. The brother-sister dynamics between her and Ed Harris in this movie are simply spot-on perfect, and very endearing. But also very raw, and very real. There are many opportunities in this film for melodrama, and sappy sentimentality, but the three actors (and the exceptional screenplay) simply don't allow that to happen. For such an intense and emotionally gripping movie as this one proves to be, there is perhaps as little Hollywood sentimetality as you will ever see in a movie. And it's the believability of all this that makes it so powerful.Last but not least: Ed Harris. I can't say as I've ever seen a movie he was in where he wasn't outstanding, but this one may be his best. Don't remember who won the Oscar that year, and I suppose his role as Dave would have been in the supporting actor category, but he SHOULD have won it. He convincingly portrays a blue-collar worker (truck-driver), who has been unable to overcome his personal grief over the loss of his friend Bobby in the war. He's become an alcoholic, physically and emotionally dependent on Martha for his day-to-day well being and care, and he reacts to Megg's initial appearance on the scene with believable distaste.....for you see, Meggs forces him to remember things Dave wants to forget. There are many dramatically moving and powerful scenes in this short flick, but one of the more memorable for me is when Dave makes an impromptu visit to the neat, suburban home of Bobbie's parents, in an attempt to assuage some of his inner turmoil and grief. If you can watch this scene and be unmoved, then you are 100% stone.The musical score is also very complimentary, with a lone-trumpet track that weaves in and out of the movie, and seems to perfectly capture the loneliness, longing, and yes, hope, within each of the character's hearts. Bad music might have ruined a quiet, reflective movie like this one; in this case, it's just another aspect of the movie that stands out as simply superb.For those interested to know why this movie garners an ""R"" rating, there is a fair amount of profanity (as you would expect, I might add, between two blue-collar war buddies), and one scene with sexual suggestion (though no frank nudity) between Meggs and Martha. I have no problem watching this movie with my older teenage children, and I am a father of six. Like everything else in this finely crafted movie, the profanty is never excessive or out of place, and the sexual coupling of Meggs and Martha seems even necessary, and is quite touching. All well done.The above, and largely for the sake of brevity, is an admittedly poor summary of the masterful acting by the three pricipal actors in this movie. If you've never seen this excellent film, and appreciate adult drama, this is as good as it gets.Highly recommended, and also a movie that holds its appeal after repeated viewings, and has yet to seem dated, too.",5,Acting Trifecta,1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,7317,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Jacknife', 'many', 'years', 'just', 'recently', 'decided', 'upgrade', 'dvd', 'version', 'now',

He is basically  a guy who works his job and then comes home to ply himself with alcohol, trying daily to drown out the horrible memories of the war he was in.Deniro sees his suffering and seeks to do something about it, and while doing so, starts falling for Harris' sister.The interesting theme here is about rescuing/saving people and it plays out in war and post war.  You see through flashbacks the relationship Deniro and Harris had- and the person they also had in common as a friend while they were in combat.This was a great movie, very heartfelt and warm.  Deniro comes across as so gregarious and goofy- you can't NOT like him.He doesn't give up on trying to help Harris and he doesn't give up on trying to woo Harris' sister.Overall a movie that shows Deniro with an easy going humor and depicts his character as a guy with a big heart and a genuinely good soul. A man who has his own emotional war wounds, yet wants to help others. A man that is a romantic-if a bit of a quirky one.If you want something different with Robert Deniro as the lead, this movie is worth a look.

Watch it closely and prepare for the invasion. This is why so very many Vietnam vets could not take living at home again, nor keep a steady job. And this is the future harvest of the present bush wars. Be prepared.Supplement this viewing with Coming Home, with John Voight, for an inside view of how the VA treats returning servicemen who come home damaged. THe reality is even worse, but this film gives a Hollywood water downed flavor of how it was.

See also only the first half hour of First Blood before the entire series flies off into fantasy land.

190704,A328S9RN3U5M68,1573627186,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","JACKNIFE is a fine adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's play 'Strange Snow' (the screenplay was also written by Metcalfe), sensitively directed byDavid Hugh Jones, that explores the too frequently forgotten effect of battle on veterans damaged permanently by the heinous cruelties of war.  It is especially poignant to return to this 1989 film now as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the raw treatment they are receiving in our Veterans' Hospitals.Three friends went off to the Vietnam War together and only two returned alive: the problem is that while both men suffered in battle the one David 'Highschool' Flannigan (Ed Harris) is so severely damaged by posttraumatic stress syndrome that he 'exists' in a drunken vacuum with his very plain schoolteacher sister Martha (Kathy Baker).  As David deteriorates his buddy Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the town in an attempt to help his friend.  In the course of events Jacknife at first offers succor to Martha and eventually the two date - at a Prom Martha must attend - and at that prom drunken David completely falls apart, destroying relics in the school and terrifying the townspeople and students.  Jacknife makes Dave relive the moment in Vietnam when they lost their buddy and in doing so brings David to the point where he can begin his climb toward recovery. And the longsuffering Martha finds her needs tended by Jacknife, too.All three actors give astonishingly fine performances: Ed Harris offers one of his most fully realized roles while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards set by their careers.

190705,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,1573627186,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 4]","Sometimes I think I should just let my unconscious take over my video programming.  I first watched JACKNIFE a year ago last Veterans Day.  It wasn't deliberate but this drama of two Vietnam vets still struggling to come to terms with their traumatic war experiences years later was in many ways the perfect choice. Not a perfect movie, but a perfect fit for a somewhat solemn, somber day of reflection--one that honors the dead and the living, but still tells the truth about the horrible waste of war.The movie has been rightly touted as an acting tour de force, and the three leads, Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker are all astonishingly good.  And while some have criticized the movie as being too stagy (it IS based on a play--STRANGE SNOW--after all), the acting is so flawless that the film's occasional lapses into theatricality are easily overlooked.  This is one theater piece that has been successfully opened up for the cinema.  The naturalistic acting is but one component.  The cinematography and the authentic location shots add to the effect.  I'm originally from Maine, not Connecticut, but that sure looked like a classic blue collar New England town to me.And I guess that's one reason the film resonated with me.  I remember those towns.  I remember the Vietnam era--and how odd it seemed that a war in some remote country could penetrate our enclosed little world.  That it could reach out and grab up our brothers and friends...it almost seemed inconceivable.  Yet it was all too real.In fairness to the film's critics, much of the plotting is a little obvious.  There aren't that many surprises.  And when near the film's end the tortured alcoholic vet played by Ed Harris has breaks into his own high school on PROM NIGHT and in a drunken frenzy, destroys a trophy case in which pictures of himself as a high school football star are still prominently displayed some 20 years after he must have graduated, you have to have seen that one coming.  Conversely when subsequently takes active part in the encounter group that he walked out a few scenes earlier, one that his concerned war buddy DeNiro (the ""Jacknife"" of the title) had introduced him to several scenes before, well, that's no surprise either.Stories that adhere to a bit of formula, however, can transcend those limits, with a bit of grace and genuine intelligence (in the script and in the actors' performances) and that's what happens here.  You don't begrudge these characters their qualified happy ending, because (a)it's just understated enough and (b)a sad ending might have seemed equally contrived.  If not downright forced.  You're rooting for these characters, and the payoff is that yes, by the film's end, they are beginning to learn how to let go and to move on, and take all those other steps that everyone tells us we must do.  And that are so damn hard.The tear you will likely find yourself shedding at the film's end is one that earned honestly.",4,Working Class Heroes,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2957,"['Sometimes', 'think', 'should', 'just', 'let', 'unconscious', 'take', 'video', 'programming', 'first', 'watched', 'JACKNIFE', 'year', 'ago', 'last', 'Veterans', 'Day', 'was', ""n't"", 'deliberate', 'drama', 'two', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'still', 'struggling', 'come', 'terms', 'traumatic', 'war', 'experiences', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'perfect', 'fit', 'somewhat', 'solemn', 'somber', 'day', 'reflection', 'one', 'dead', 'living', 'still', 'truth', 'horrible', 'waste', 'war.The', 'movie', 'been', 'rightly', 'touted', 'acting', 'tour', 'force', 'three', 'leads', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'are', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'have', 'criticized', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'stagy', 'based', 'play', 'STRANGE', 'SNOW', 'acting', 'so', 'flawless', 'film', 'occasional', 'lapses', 'theatricality', 'are', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'one', 'theater', 'piece', 'been', 'successfully', 'opened', 'up', 'cinema', 'naturalistic', 'acting', 'one', 'component', 'cinematography', 'authentic', 'location', 'shots', 'add', 'effect', ""'m"", 'originally', 'Maine', 'not', 'Connecticut', 'sure', 'looked', 'classic', 'blue', 'collar', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'me.And', 'guess', 'one', 'reason', 'film', 'resonated', 'remember', 'towns', 'remember', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'how', 'odd', 'seemed', 'war', 'remote', 'country', 'could', 'penetrate', 'enclosed', 'little', 'world', 'could', 'reach', 'out', 'grab', 'up', 'brothers', 'friends', 'almost', 'seemed', 'inconceivable', 'was', 'too', 'real.In', 'fairness', 'film', 'critics', 'much', 'plotting', 'little', 'obvious', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'surprises', 'when', 'film', 'end', 'tortured', 'alcoholic', 'vet', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'breaks', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'PROM', 'NIGHT', 'drunken', 'frenzy', 'trophy', 'case', 'pictures', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'star', 'are', 'still', 'prominently', 'displayed', '20', 'years', 'must', 'have', 'graduated', 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'coming', 'Conversely', 'when', 'subsequently', 'active', 'part', 'encounter', 'group', 'walked', 'out', 'few', 'scenes', 'earlier', 'concerned', 'war', 'buddy', 'DeNiro', 'Jacknife', 'title', 'had', 'introduced', 'several', 'scenes', 'well', 'surprise', 'adhere', 'bit', 'formula', 'however', 'can', 'transcend', 'limits', 'bit', 'grace', 'genuine', 'intelligence', 'script', 'actors', 'performances', 'what', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'characters', 'qualified', 'happy', 'ending', 'just', 'understated', 'enough', 'b', 'sad', 'ending', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'equally', 'contrived', 'not', 'downright', 'forced', ""'re"", 'rooting', 'characters', 'payoff', 'yes', 'film', 'end', 'are', 'beginning', 'learn', 'how', 'let', 'go', 'move', 'take', 'other', 'steps', 'everyone', 'must', 'do', 'are', 'so', 'damn', 'hard.The', 'tear', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'shedding', 'film', 'end', 'one', 'earned', 'honestly']",N/A

At least four and a half. This virtually unknown film, directed by David Jones, is a tour de force for actors DeNiro, Ed Harris, and Kathy Baker. Each of them is so good it's impossible to find a single line--even a single word--that's out of place, or a misstep, or just plain wrong.The script is by Stephen Metcalfe who adapted his stage play ""Strange Snow"" to the screen and did a masterful job. It's the story of two Vietnam vets (Harris and DeNiro) who both found jobs working with vehicles--Harris as a truck driver and DeNiro as a mechanic. But Harris has become a drunk because it's impossible for him to forget what happened to their mutual bud Bobby, tragically killed in Vietnam.Emotions run high here, yet this is anything but melodrama. It's high drama, yes, but the dialogue is very smart and heartfelt and as strong as steel. There's no phony tears, no strident or schmaltzy words, no false moves anywhere. DeNiro--Megs--visits Harris and Baker (playing Harris' sister) to rouse Harris out of his drunken stupor, to go fishing with him, to remind him, in essence, that the two of them both have lives to lead, that the past is the past and that while it will never be forgotten, it should never get in the way of living life the way it was meant to be lived.Megs is a larger than life character, and DeNiro handles this role like he was born for it. His nickname is the film's title. The real foil for his character is Baker, who is also perfect as the biology teacher who feels, who knows, that below Megs' surface craziness is a true heart that wants to be happy.A terrific piece of work, and very highly recommended.",4,Great unknown drama,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,1809,"['was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'typically', 'reserve', 'five', 'stars', 'absolute', 'masterpieces', 'Kurosawa', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'rating', 'least', 'four', 'half', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'film', 'directed', 'David', 'Jones', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'actors', 'DeNiro', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'so', 'good', 'impossible', 'find', 'single', 'line', 'even', 'single', 'word', 'place', 'misstep', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong.The', 'script', 'Stephen', 'Metcalfe', 'who', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'Strange', 'Snow', 'screen', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'story', 'two', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'Harris', 'DeNiro', 'who', 'found', 'jobs', 'working', 'vehicles', 'Harris', 'truck', 'driver', 'DeNiro', 'mechanic', 'Harris', 'become', 'drunk', 'impossible', 'forget', 'what', 'happened', 'mutual', 'bud', 'Bobby', 'tragically', 'killed', 'Vietnam.Emotions', 'run', 'high', 'here', 'yet', 'anything', 'melodrama', 'high', 'drama', 'yes', 'dialogue', 'very', 'smart', 'heartfelt', 'as', 'strong', 'steel', 'phony', 'tears', 'strident', 'schmaltzy', 'words', 'false', 'moves', 'anywhere', 'DeNiro', 'Megs', 'visits', 'Harris', 'Baker', 'playing', 'Harris', 'sister', 'rouse', 'Harris', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'go', 'fishing', 'remind', 'essence', 'two', 'have', 'lives', 'lead', 'past', 'past', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'should', 'never', 'get', 'way', 'living', 'life', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'lived.Megs', 'larger', 'life', 'character', 'DeNiro', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'nickname', 'film', 'title', 'real', 'foil', 'character', 'Baker', 'who', 'also', 'perfect', 'biology', 'teacher', 'who', 'who', 'Megs', 'surface', 'craziness', 'true', 'heart', 'be', 'happy.A', 'terrific', 'piece', 'work', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Megs doesn't look up Dave because he necessarily wants to but because he has to -- they have a longstanding date to go fishing, a date with much significance.Kathy is a biology teacher and the classic enabler, a one-woman support system enabling her brother to continue in his miserable cycle of booze/hangover/booze. She's trapped and her guilt will not let her escape, and she knows shes trapped.There's a scene of Kathy leaving the school at the end of her work day where she goes out of her way to stop at the trophy case and looks at old pictures of her brother when he was a high school hero with much potential. You can feel what she feels as she looks at those pictures.Dave warns Kathy about Megs -- he's half crazy and has spent a lot of time in the slammer on assault charges, but Kathy instinctively senses that Megs is their catalyst to change, their ""delivererer,"" carbuncles and all. Yet Megs needs change as well, and Kathy is HIS deliverer. Megs is an eccentric outcast and Kathy is his golden connection to a sense of family and community, things he's been running from since he got out of the war 20 years earlier.Kathy is a bit of a plain jane. Her stagnated lifestyle is reflected on her face. No one invited her to her Prom back in high school and who knows the last time she had a date. Yet on her initial meeting with Megs he just happens to mention she's pretty. This immediately changes her demeanor. When was the last time she felt the warmth of a genuine compliment concerning her looks? She naturally starts to develop love for this man -- a deeply flawed man -- somehthing she hasn't felt for a long, long time, perhaps never. And she slowly starts to blossom.""Jacknife"" is the perfect antidote to modern cgi-laden drivel like ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and ""Iron Man."" Don't get me wrong, those types of films have their place, like when you're in the mood for mindless entertainment -- goofy one-liners and all. By contrast, ""Jacknife"" is meaningful and character-driven; suspense is created via raw, unpredictable emotion and outstanding acting (by all three members of the triangle). Take, for instance, the truck-driving scene where Dave and Megs have a confrontation. Megs starts to put the meddle to the peddle as they drive down an incline. Dave had implied that Megs was crazy and now Megs is making a statement. Or is he? Who knows what he's doing?! The truck goes faster and faster and the viewer is uncertain if this lunatic is going to kill 'em both or what.This scene is potent because it strikes the viewer as REAL. For me it brought to memory a similar situation when my wife and I were traveling through the heart of West Virginia. We drove in silence for a long time, perhaps two hours, and then I completely exploded, screaming at the top of my lungs -- spit and tears flying. Yet I wasn't yelling at her -- not at all -- it went much deeper than that. We were flying down the highway faster and faster while I continued to vent in raw emotion. Then my wife, the epitome of calm and stable, screams out, ""IF YOU'RE GOING TO WRECK MAKE SURE YOU KILL US BOTH!!!"" That was almost four years ago and, thankfully, nothing like it has happened since. Why do I bring this experience up? Because ""Jacknife,"" albeit a tad stagey (which is natural since it was based on a play), rings so true.The film was shot on location in the heart of Connecticut in Meriden, Cromwell and Wethersfield (the diner scene). The story obviously takes place in November and the authentic locations are great.BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a meaningful, character-driven drama you can't go wrong with ""Jacknife.""PERSONAL GRADE: A-",5,The best drama you've never seen,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,4056,"['Released', '1989', 'Jacknife', 'story', 'Megs', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'who', 'up', 'old', 'war', 'buddy', 'Connecticut', 'buddy', 'Dave', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'bachelor', 'drunkard', 'who', 'sister', 'Martha', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'inherited', 'parent', 'house', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'Dave', 'Martha', 'situation', 'degenerated', 'lifeless', 'habit', 'stagnation', 'Megs', ""n't"", 'look', 'up', 'Dave', 'necessarily', 'have', 'longstanding', 'date', 'go', 'fishing', 'date', 'much', 'significance.Kathy', 'biology', 'teacher', 'classic', 'enabler', 'one-woman', 'support', 'system', 'enabling', 'brother', 'continue', 'miserable', 'cycle', 'booze/hangover/booze', 'trapped', 'guilt', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'escape', 'shes', 'scene', 'Kathy', 'leaving', 'school', 'end', 'work', 'day', 'where', 'way', 'stop', 'trophy', 'case', 'old', 'pictures', 'brother', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'hero', 'much', 'potential', 'can', 'feel', 'what', 'feels', 'pictures.Dave', 'warns', 'Kathy', 'Megs', 'half', 'crazy', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'slammer', 'assault', 'charges', 'Kathy', 'instinctively', 'Megs', 'catalyst', 'change', 'delivererer', 'carbuncles', 'Megs', 'change', 'as', 'well', 'Kathy', 'HIS', 'deliverer', 'Megs', 'eccentric', 'outcast', 'Kathy', 'golden', 'connection', 'sense', 'family', 'community', 'things', 'been', 'running', 'got', 'out', 'war', '20', 'years', 'earlier.Kathy', 'bit', 'plain', 'jane', 'stagnated', 'lifestyle', 'reflected', 'face', 'one', 'invited', 'Prom', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'last', 'time', 'had', 'date', 'initial', 'meeting', 'Megs', 'just', 'mention', 'pretty', 'immediately', 'demeanor', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'felt', 'warmth', 'genuine', 'compliment', 'concerning', 'looks', 'naturally', 'develop', 'love', 'man', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'man', 'somehthing', ""n't"", 'felt', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'perhaps', 'never', 'slowly', 'blossom', 'Jacknife', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'modern', 'cgi-laden', 'drivel', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'types', 'films', 'have', 'place', 'when', ""'re"", 'mood', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'goofy', 'one-liners', 'contrast', 'Jacknife', 'meaningful', 'character-driven', 'suspense', 'created', 'raw', 'unpredictable', 'emotion', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'three', 'members', 'triangle', 'Take', 'instance', 'truck-driving', 'scene', 'where', 'Dave', 'Megs', 'have', 'confrontation', 'Megs', 'put', 'meddle', 'peddle', 'drive', 'down', 'incline', 'Dave', 'had', 'implied', 'Megs', 'was', 'crazy', 'now', 'Megs', 'making', 'statement', 'Who', 'what', 'doing', 'truck', 'faster', 'faster', 'viewer', 'uncertain', 'lunatic', 'going', 'kill', 'what.This', 'scene', 'potent', 'viewer', 'REAL', 'brought', 'memory', 'similar', 'situation', 'when', 'wife', 'were', 'traveling', 'heart', 'West', 'Virginia', 'drove', 'silence', 'long', 'time', 'perhaps', 'two', 'hours', 'then', 'completely', 'exploded', 'screaming', 'top', 'lungs', 'spit', 'tears', 'flying', 'was', ""n't"", 'yelling', 'not', 'went', 'much', 'deeper', 'were', 'flying', 'down', 'highway', 'faster', 'faster', 'continued', 'vent', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Then', 'wife', 'epitome', 'calm', 'stable', 'out', 'IF', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'GOING', 'TO', 'WRECK', 'MAKE', 'SURE', 'YOU', 'KILL', 'US', 'BOTH', 'was', 'almost', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'thankfully', 'nothing', 'happened', 'Why', 'do', 'bring', 'experience', 'up', 'Jacknife', 'tad', 'stagey', 'natural', 'was', 'based', 'play', 'rings', 'true.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'heart', 'Connecticut', 'Meriden', 'Cromwell', 'Wethersfield', 'diner', 'scene', 'story', 'obviously', 'place', 'November', 'authentic', 'locations', 'are', 'great.BOTTOM', 'LINE', ""'re"", 'mood', 'meaningful', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Jacknife', 'PERSONAL', 'GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
