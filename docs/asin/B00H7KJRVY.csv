I am so glad I picked this up when I went to the video store.  I am not a huge fan of Ben Stiller, I like a couple of his movies but once is often enough for many of them, not so with Mitty.I loved everything about Ben Stiller's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty: the music, the visual/cinematography, characters, the actors who did a fantastic job and the interpretation of the story.  I personally think this interpretation can apply to so many people who live without actually experiencing life.

1683944,A3GPFTYWN7LQ48,B00H7KJRVY,,"[0, 0]","This is the story of Walter Mitty; a day-dreamer who escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasy . Its also the story of how Ben Stiller starred and directed a film that feels just a few steps short of pure cinematic brilliance! I was completely shocked to discover that this film was so universally panned by critics when it came out. I see the obvious flaw within the film, but for everyone to simply turn a blind eye towards this movie is nothing short of disappointing.First the bad...From the trailer, you easily get the feeling that this will be a film that would get so called &#34;Oscar buzz.&#34; That's at least the feeling I got when I first heard about this movie. You've got Ben Stiller in what looks like the type of role you love to see popular comedians do; the ones where they break away from their usually schtick and try something charming and more dramatic (Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine, Will Ferrell in Stranger Than Fiction). And actually, for the most part, that's really what you get from Stiller. He's the everyman. The quiet anonymous man with a dream of being more than he is. Unfortunately, Stiller (who also directed this picture) believes its necessary to show us every single fantasy that pops inside this characters head. THIS is really where my criticism lies. In the first 40 minutes or so of this movie, you're treated to a parade of Walter Mitty's rich often CG-filled inner life. And its in these sequences that you really get a mixed feeling going on.The trailer screams &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; while the first act offers up mostly Anchorman, Tropic Thunder, pretty much any broad comedy you can think from the passed decade. Its just that these fantasy sequences, while sometimes funny, don't really fit very well into the rest of the feature. It wouldn't bother me as much if it happened maybe two or three times, but after about six or seven times throughout the first 40 minutes, it really started to bug me. I understood everything that Walter was about before we were introduced to his ILM imagination and I was already rooting for him to succeed. Ben Stiller didn't need to include all these sequences to get his point across. While they would have worked perfectly fine in a broader comedy, here it feels out of place with the tone of the rest of the movie...And now for the good....After Walter Mitty finally has a goal and the motivation to begin his journey, that is when the film REALLY begins to become the film you were probably expecting it to be. The music, the direction, the cinematography, EVERYTHING that happens from this point on is incredibly well done! There's even a scene where Walter has another fantasy sequence...but somehow this one works! I know I was critical of the ones that came before, but this one is a lot smaller and a lot better integrated into the movie. Had Walter's day dreams been a bit more subtle and smaller like this one seen later on, I probably wouldn't have minded them so much and probably really enjoyed them.Its almost a complete tonal shift from what you were introduced to. It becomes a film that captures the adventure of traveling into the unknown and gives you that really uplifting feeling that shows you how incredible life can really be. Its your typical story of an ordinary man who goes off and does extraordinary things, but it does it extremely well (in the latter half of the movie at least). That's what hurts the most; that this truly awesome movie has such a sporadic and sub-pare beginning. Perhaps that's why people found it so underwhelming; I think if you go in knowing it'll eventually become the movie you were wanting it to be, you'll be able to forgive it and enjoy the ride that it takes you on. I know I did.The cinematography is amazing; honestly the wider the camera gets, the more beautiful it becomes! Its hard to believe places like this still exist and it really makes you want to get out there and explore the world. All the actors deliver great performances under Stiller's surprisingly good direction. The idea behind the fate of Life Magazine in this movie is satirical of the state of things today.On a lighter note, one question you'll be asking yourself after you see the movie:What MAGIC cell phone provider does Walter Mitty have?!This has been a Film Fanatic Review...",4,"Film Fanatic's Review Of ""The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty""",1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,4326,"['story', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'day-dreamer', 'who', 'anonymous', 'life', 'disappearing', 'world', 'fantasy', 'also', 'story', 'how', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'starred', 'directed', 'film', 'just', 'few', 'steps', 'short', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'brilliance', 'was', 'completely', 'shocked', 'discover', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'universally', 'panned', 'critics', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'see', 'obvious', 'flaw', 'film', 'everyone', 'simply', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'movie', 'nothing', 'short', 'disappointing.First', 'bad', 'trailer', 'easily', 'get', 'feeling', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'would', 'get', 'so', 'called', '34', 'Oscar', 'buzz.', '34', 'least', 'feeling', 'got', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'what', 'type', 'role', 'love', 'see', 'popular', 'comedians', 'do', 'ones', 'where', 'break', 'away', 'usually', 'schtick', 'try', 'something', 'charming', 'more', 'dramatic', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'actually', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'what', 'get', 'Stiller', 'everyman', 'quiet', 'anonymous', 'man', 'dream', 'being', 'more', 'Unfortunately', 'Stiller', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'picture', 'necessary', 'show', 'single', 'fantasy', 'characters', 'head', 'THIS', 'really', 'where', 'criticism', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', ""'re"", 'treated', 'parade', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'rich', 'often', 'CG-filled', 'inner', 'life', 'sequences', 'really', 'get', 'mixed', 'feeling', 'going', 'on.The', 'trailer', 'screams', '34', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '34', 'first', 'act', 'up', 'mostly', 'Anchorman', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'pretty', 'much', 'broad', 'comedy', 'can', 'think', 'passed', 'decade', 'just', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'rest', 'feature', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'happened', 'maybe', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'six', 'seven', 'times', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'really', 'started', 'bug', 'understood', 'everything', 'Walter', 'was', 'were', 'introduced', 'ILM', 'imagination', 'was', 'already', 'rooting', 'succeed', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'include', 'sequences', 'get', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'broader', 'comedy', 'here', 'place', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie', 'now', 'good', '.After', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'finally', 'goal', 'motivation', 'begin', 'journey', 'when', 'film', 'REALLY', 'become', 'film', 'were', 'probably', 'expecting', 'be', 'music', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'EVERYTHING', 'point', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'Walter', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'somehow', 'one', 'know', 'was', 'critical', 'ones', 'came', 'one', 'lot', 'smaller', 'lot', 'better', 'integrated', 'movie', 'Had', 'Walter', 'day', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'subtle', 'smaller', 'one', 'seen', 'later', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'so', 'much', 'probably', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'them.Its', 'almost', 'complete', 'tonal', 'shift', 'what', 'were', 'introduced', 'film', 'adventure', 'traveling', 'unknown', 'really', 'uplifting', 'feeling', 'how', 'incredible', 'life', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'typical', 'story', 'ordinary', 'man', 'who', 'off', 'extraordinary', 'things', 'extremely', 'well', 'latter', 'half', 'movie', 'least', 'what', 'most', 'truly', 'awesome', 'movie', 'sporadic', 'sub-pare', 'beginning', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'people', 'found', 'so', 'underwhelming', 'think', 'go', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'become', 'movie', 'were', 'wanting', 'be', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'know', 'did.The', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'honestly', 'wider', 'camera', 'more', 'beautiful', 'hard', 'believe', 'places', 'still', 'exist', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'there', 'explore', 'world', 'actors', 'deliver', 'great', 'performances', 'Stiller', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'direction', 'idea', 'fate', 'Life', 'Magazine', 'movie', 'satirical', 'state', 'things', 'today.On', 'lighter', 'note', 'one', 'question', ""'ll"", 'be', 'asking', 'see', 'movie', 'What', 'MAGIC', 'cell', 'phone', 'provider', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'have', 'been', 'Film', 'Fanatic', 'Review']",N/A

Up until then, I thought I was the only one who could go off on wild adventures without leaving the house. Author James Thurber showed me otherwise.Our day-dreaming Caspar Milquetoast imagines PG-rated heroic actions, brilliant strategies and a love story for the ages in order to escape the humdrum boredom of the job he has held for sixteen years. Writer Steve Conrad (""The Pursuit of Happyness"") has wisely set his story in a current corporate down-sizing situation, fraught with job loss and grief for a magazine that will no longer be printed. The company taking over is staffed by heartless suits who only see numbers, not people in that magazine.We watch:* Ben Stiller (""Arrested Development"") as our eponymous hero who ""spaces out"" occasionally. He has a passport but has never gone anywhere.* Kathryn Hahn (""We're the Millers"") is his sister who wants to audition for Rizzo in ""Grease.""* Kristen Wiig (""Saturday Night Live"") has just been hired at the same magazine; she has a three-legged dog and a two-legged son.* Adam Scott (""Parks and Recreation"") plays the new broom that is going to sweep everything clean. He is cold, demanding and has no clue about the history of the company that is being taken over.* Shirley MacLaine (""Downton Abbey"") is Walter's ever-lovin' mom, being moved to that assisted living facility with a piano that is waaaay too big.* Patton Oswalt (""Young Adult"") works at the computer-dating service that Walter subscribes to; he wants our hero to have a more interesting r&eacute;sum&eacute;.It has been a Hollywood dream to commit this fantasy-laced story to film for a long, long time (the one with Danny Kaye really doesn't count). Now with unfettered Computer Generated Imaging, director Ben Stiller has finally achieved the dream.

1683952,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B00H7KJRVY,,"[7, 21]","Written as a short-story in the '30s by James Thurber, the story was made into a film with Danny Kaye. This remake doesn't quite do it justice. The story involves a day-dreamer who creates four scenarios in which he is a hero, rather than a henpecked husband of his fat wife. Ben Stiller directs and has directed several films before. He also plays Mitty. This would be a good film for a film class to study in that it has SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many things wrong with it! I'll just list them to make it easier.*Although I can see why the film didn't recoup its $90M production budget at the box office, it must have been 'free' to make, as it is nothing but a giant advertisement for multitudes of fast-food places and was apparently commercially sponsored. Integrating 'E harmony.com' into the actual plot was so incredibly lame as to make us want to leave the theater! If producers are going to do this, they need to pay US to go see the film!*Using a real business (Life Magazine) as it went from paper to dot.com was more than lame. [Life ended its paper magazine from various formats in 2007 and closed it's dot.com service in 2012.]*Although we all wish we could travel the world and take pictures with somebody else footing the unlimited bill, the storyline in having an editor chase down a field photographer is also lame. I would have to cite the storyline and writing problem as the primary cause of how terrible this film actually is. The producers should have stuck with Thurber's original fantasies and left it at that. Instead we have a ridiculous superhero chase a-la-Marvel Comics and a superhero saving a dog from a fire. In the end, Mitty gets cajones and jets off to Iceland, gets attacked by a volcano and climbs the Himalayas. What were these writers on to come up with these lame scenarios?*Although Stiller suffers from a similar malady to some other actors (Eastwood, Willis, Costner)we are reminded that some people can act and some can't!

1683956,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00H7KJRVY,Andrew Ellington,"[100, 114]","Ben Stiller is an interesting celebrity.  He&#8217;s built his career on playing the lovable dork, the guy who you can&#8217;t help but like to be around but who can&#8217;t help but screw everything up.  The general public embraces him, and he has yet to completely tarnish his career by following the career path of Adam Sandler (who was always a more abrasive and easily dislikable comedian to begin with).  Stiller has never been offensive in his film choices and yet he&#8217;s never been all that adventurous either.  He kind of stays in a comfortable wheelhouse and rarely ventures outside of that box.Looking at his film career from the standpoint of an actor is one thing, but looking at his career as a director can bring a different feeling.  He&#8217;s now directed five films, and they are all rather notable.  &#8216;Reality Bites&#8217; is a sincere film about those confusing teenage years (and it has some really identifiable social commentary), &#8216;The Cable Guy&#8217; was a huge moment for Jim Carry and continues to be considered a comedic cult classic.  &#8216;Zoolander&#8217; is one of the funniest movies of the aughts and &#8216;Tropic Thunder&#8217; (I didn&#8217;t even know he directed that) netted an Oscar nomination for one of its stars.It&#8217;s a great list, but then &#8216;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&#8217; comes along and brings something entirely new and different to the table.I have not read the source material or seen the original film (from the 40&#8217;s) but from what I gather this is a completely revamped adaptation and so it doesn&#8217;t need to be compared to previous versions.  In Stiller&#8217;s &#8216;Mitty&#8217;, our protagonist, Walter, works for the ever-changing &#8216;Life Magazine&#8217;.  He is a man dedicated to his work and a man with little real life ambitions.  He doesn&#8217;t seek out the true adventures in life and instead lives his life from a distance where he fantasizes about having the kind of life that other people actually live.  He has fallen for the new girl, but lacks the courage to approach her so he stalks her from an internet dating service that is having technical difficulties.  When he has a very important photograph placed in his hands, he finds his world beginning to shift.  The image is lost, his job is in jeopardy and his spirit soars with excitement as he chases the photography to the ends of the earth looking for the image.In the heart of adventure, his life is reborn.The message in &#8216;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&#8217; is a simple one, dealt with rather simply and because of that it has a deeper impact.  Living your life isn&#8217;t truly living if you never really live.  Does that make sense?  It does when you watch Stiller&#8217;s beautifully crafted film.  You can feel the energy that is displaced in all the right areas, creating a beautiful presence that pulls the audience along from scene to scene.  What I love about this film is that it doesn&#8217;t make the film an advocate for literal adventure as much as one for the adventure of life itself.  While Mitty has his share of excitement traveling the globe, hiking mountains and swimming with sharks, the real adventure is not being afraid to reach out and grab the things you really want.  The real beauty in life is often taken for granted because we are expecting something else, something manufactured, and yet we don&#8217;t realize how special the life right in front of us really is.We are living with eyes wide shut.Stiller direction is rather impressive.  He builds a beautifully languid story and finds ways to heighten our excitement with visuals that arouse interest and a fluidity that never shakes our interest.  I was actually blindsided with how effortless the whole film feels.  The comedic interludes, the heartfelt themes, the rich development, and subtle yet effective acting; all of it comes together and creates a unified and completely delightful film.",5,My not so secret love of Walter Mitty&#8230;,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,3966,"['Ben', 'Stiller', 'interesting', 'celebrity', '8217', 'built', 'career', 'playing', 'lovable', 'dork', 'guy', 'who', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'like', 'be', 'around', 'who', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'screw', 'everything', 'up', 'general', 'public', 'yet', 'completely', 'tarnish', 'career', 'following', 'career', 'path', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'abrasive', 'easily', 'dislikable', 'comedian', 'begin', 'Stiller', 'never', 'been', 'offensive', 'film', 'choices', 'yet', '8217', 's', 'never', 'been', 'adventurous', 'kind', 'stays', 'comfortable', 'wheelhouse', 'rarely', 'ventures', 'box.Looking', 'film', 'career', 'standpoint', 'actor', 'one', 'thing', 'looking', 'career', 'director', 'can', 'bring', 'different', 'feeling', '8217', 'now', 'directed', 'five', 'films', 'are', 'rather', 'notable', '8216', 'Reality', 'Bites', '8217', 'sincere', 'film', 'confusing', 'teenage', 'years', 'really', 'identifiable', 'social', 'commentary', '8216', 'Cable', 'Guy', '8217', 'was', 'huge', 'moment', 'Jim', 'Carry', 'be', 'considered', 'comedic', 'cult', 'classic', '8216', 'Zoolander', '8217', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'aughts', '8216', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', '8217', 'didn', '8217', 'even', 'know', 'directed', 'netted', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'one', 'stars.It', '8217', 'great', 'list', 'then', '8216', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty', '8217', 'along', 'something', 'entirely', 'new', 'different', 'table.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'seen', 'original', 'film', '40', '8217', 's', 'what', 'gather', 'completely', 'revamped', 'adaptation', '8217', 'need', 'be', 'compared', 'previous', 'versions', 'Stiller', '8217', '8216', 'Mitty', '8217', 'protagonist', 'Walter', 'ever-changing', '8216', 'Life', 'Magazine', '8217', 'man', 'dedicated', 'work', 'man', 'little', 'real', 'life', 'ambitions', '8217', 'seek', 'out', 'true', 'adventures', 'life', 'instead', 'life', 'distance', 'where', 'having', 'kind', 'life', 'other', 'people', 'actually', 'live', 'fallen', 'new', 'girl', 'courage', 'approach', 'so', 'internet', 'dating', 'service', 'having', 'technical', 'difficulties', 'When', 'very', 'important', 'photograph', 'placed', 'hands', 'world', 'beginning', 'shift', 'image', 'lost', 'job', 'jeopardy', 'spirit', 'soars', 'excitement', 'photography', 'ends', 'earth', 'looking', 'image.In', 'heart', 'adventure', 'life', 'reborn.The', 'message', '8216', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty', '8217', 'simple', 'one', 'rather', 'simply', 'deeper', 'impact', 'Living', 'life', 'isn', '8217', 'truly', 'living', 'never', 'really', 'live', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'watch', 'Stiller', '8217', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'film', 'can', 'feel', 'energy', 'displaced', 'right', 'areas', 'creating', 'beautiful', 'presence', 'audience', 'scene', 'scene', 'What', 'love', 'film', '8217', 'make', 'film', 'advocate', 'literal', 'adventure', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'adventure', 'life', 'Mitty', 'share', 'excitement', 'traveling', 'globe', 'hiking', 'mountains', 'swimming', 'sharks', 'real', 'adventure', 'not', 'being', 'afraid', 'reach', 'out', 'grab', 'things', 'really', 'want', 'real', 'beauty', 'life', 'often', 'taken', 'granted', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'something', 'manufactured', 'yet', 'don', '8217', 'realize', 'how', 'special', 'life', 'right', 'front', 'really', 'is.We', 'are', 'living', 'eyes', 'wide', 'shut.Stiller', 'direction', 'rather', 'impressive', 'beautifully', 'languid', 'story', 'ways', 'heighten', 'excitement', 'visuals', 'arouse', 'interest', 'fluidity', 'never', 'interest', 'was', 'actually', 'blindsided', 'how', 'effortless', 'whole', 'film', 'feels', 'comedic', 'interludes', 'heartfelt', 'themes', 'rich', 'development', 'subtle', 'yet', 'effective', 'acting', 'together', 'unified', 'completely', 'delightful', 'film']",N/A

This movie is much funnier than the trailer made it seem.  (The trailer was one of the most incoherent I've seen in a while, and that's saying a lot, since many trailers today are hard to make any sense out of.)  Based on James Thurber's short story of the same name, both Walter Mitty movies resemble the short story only in that Walter's normal life keeps getting interrupted by daydreams.  The Danny Kaye movie's daydreams are entertaining but not ridiculous, while in this one, the daydreams get really ridiculous, a great outlet for Ben Stiller's quirky face and quirky sense of humor to be used.  Another point of interest is that while in the 1947 movie, Danny Kaye is a mama's boy who is nervous, Ben Stiller in this is deadpan for the most part.  About to lose his job, which is his only social life, he ends up going on an adventure around the world to try to save his job, and develops a mild romance.  (Someone as emotionally detached as him can't get too romantic even if the plot were to let him.)  Along the way there are a lot of incidents that work perfectly for Ben Stiller's quirky humor.  Sometimes it's the randomness, sometimes it's the ridiculousness/implausibility, and sometimes it's the timing, but the humor really worked for me in this movie.  I'm never able to say why it does or doesn't, but perhaps the best explanation in this case is that Ben Stiller directed his own movie.  Also, like Don Knotts, he uses his awkward-looking face as a major part of his comedic persona.  I think Stiller's funnier in this than Night at the Museum.My only point of criticism (besides that it added a few words to get a PG rating--I still don't understand why the rating, rather than merits, of a movie is supposed to bring in money) is that the pace and comedy both slackened significantly in the second half, though thankfully didn't die.  If comedic creativity had been at work more in the second half, it'd have helped the pace and kept the mood energetic and spontaneous.  However, the end is rewarding.  It's interesting that I just saw Saving Mr. Banks and thought from the trailer that it'd be a comedy when it was more of a drama, while this has much more humor and didn't seem as serious to me as the trailer made it seem.",5,A lot funnier than I thought it'd be - Ben Stiller's quirky humor is a delight,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,2383,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Danny', 'Kaye', '1947', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'paid', 'attention', 'one', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'movie', 'much', 'funnier', 'trailer', 'made', 'seem', 'trailer', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'incoherent', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'saying', 'lot', 'many', 'trailers', 'today', 'are', 'hard', 'make', 'sense', 'Based', 'James', 'Thurber', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'movies', 'resemble', 'short', 'story', 'only', 'Walter', 'normal', 'life', 'keeps', 'getting', 'interrupted', 'daydreams', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'movie', 'daydreams', 'are', 'entertaining', 'not', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'daydreams', 'get', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'great', 'outlet', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'quirky', 'face', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'be', 'used', 'point', 'interest', '1947', 'movie', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'mama', 'boy', 'who', 'nervous', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'deadpan', 'most', 'part', 'lose', 'job', 'only', 'social', 'life', 'up', 'going', 'adventure', 'world', 'try', 'save', 'job', 'mild', 'romance', 'Someone', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'romantic', 'even', 'plot', 'were', 'let', 'way', 'are', 'lot', 'incidents', 'work', 'perfectly', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'quirky', 'humor', 'randomness', 'ridiculousness/implausibility', 'timing', 'humor', 'really', 'worked', 'movie', ""'m"", 'never', 'able', 'say', 'why', ""n't"", 'perhaps', 'best', 'explanation', 'case', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'directed', 'own', 'movie', 'Also', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'awkward-looking', 'face', 'major', 'part', 'comedic', 'persona', 'think', 'Stiller', 'funnier', 'Night', 'Museum.My', 'only', 'point', 'criticism', 'added', 'few', 'words', 'get', 'PG', 'rating', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'rating', 'rather', 'merits', 'movie', 'supposed', 'bring', 'money', 'pace', 'comedy', 'slackened', 'significantly', 'second', 'half', 'thankfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'comedic', 'creativity', 'had', 'been', 'work', 'more', 'second', 'half', ""'d"", 'have', 'helped', 'pace', 'kept', 'mood', 'energetic', 'spontaneous', 'However', 'end', 'rewarding', 'interesting', 'just', 'saw', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'thought', 'trailer', ""'d"", 'be', 'comedy', 'when', 'was', 'more', 'drama', 'much', 'more', 'humor', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'serious', 'trailer', 'made', 'seem']",N/A

Sawin,"[6, 9]","Internet dating is portrayed very accurately in &#34;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.&#34; While eHarmony was always a little too pricey for someone who frequented the free dating sites, the nervousness regarding winking or messaging a new love interest is still there as is the hounding of completing your profile. It's a pleasant surprise seeing Patton Oswalt show up as often as he does. He's mostly just the guy on the other end of the telephone, but it pays off in a big way that easily seems to utilize the comedy Oswalt has become known and loved for. His enthusiasm for Walter's new found heroics is also extremely amusing.From the perspective of someone who isn't familiar with the short story the film is based on or the original 1947 film, the most appealing aspect of &#34;Walter Mitty&#34; going into it was that it looked very similar to &#34;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.&#34; Even when you're waist deep into the film, the spectacular cinematography continues to reel you in even after Walter ceases his daydreaming. Life magazine's motto is more of a mainstay to the storyline of &#34;Walter Mitty,&#34; but the motto is almost like a parallel to Alexander Pope's Eloisa to Abelard being used in &#34;Eternal Sunshine.&#34;The film is also able to introduce you to a character that is extremely easy to relate to. As a soft spoken guy who has always been uncomfortable in social situations, mostly failed at the conquest of romance, and struggled as a bit of a mumbling buffoon, Walter is like the poster child for the voiceless. Seeing Walter's marvelous journey unfold is like a hopeful push in the right direction that is both uplifting and inspiring to those who may have a difficult time finding passion or interest in this massive sea known as the everyday world around them. Walter may keep to himself, but his imagination is always burning bright and making his life interesting.Walter's adventurous and explosive segments of &#34;zoning out&#34; are strung together by a ton of humor that is sure to get its fair share of laughs. Walter's fight over Stretch Armstrong in the elevator with newly appointed boss Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) seems to borrow from &#34;The Matrix,&#34; &#34;Terminator 2,&#34; and even the chicken fight segments from &#34;Family Guy.&#34; The &#34;Benjamin Button&#34; daydream may be the most memorable due to how humorous it is as is just about everything in Greenland.If that wasn't enough, the people around Walter who he loves and looks up to are also very down to earth. Newly hired Life magazine employee Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig) is Walter's current crush. Cheryl is just trying to make a living to support her son after going through a divorce. Wiig portrays a woman who is not only approachable but easy to talk to. Her &#8220;Major Tom&#8221; sequence in Greenland is not only a major turning point for the film, but quite possibly Wiig&#8217;s standout scene. Walter also looks up to a photojournalist named Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn. While Penn's role is very small, the famous photographer doesn't let fame go to his head and seems very modest despite not having a stable address, the internet, and is practically unreachable at all times.&#34;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&#34; captures your imagination with Walter's daydreams, hits home with Walter's awkward behavior, and is inspiring to anyone who has mostly kept to themselves over the years with Walter's unbelievable journey. The fantasy adventure lets imagination and reality collide in the most fantastic of ways. It's the story of plain, ordinary, and unexpected people becoming extraordinary and dreams coming true. For once, the man behind the man gets recognition. The unthinkable and the impossible become the achievable in &#34;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.&#34;",4,The eccentric benefits of OCD,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,3823,"['Internet', 'dating', 'portrayed', 'very', 'accurately', '34', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty.', '34', 'eHarmony', 'was', 'always', 'little', 'too', 'pricey', 'someone', 'who', 'frequented', 'free', 'dating', 'sites', 'nervousness', 'regarding', 'winking', 'messaging', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'still', 'hounding', 'completing', 'profile', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'seeing', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'show', 'up', 'as', 'often', 'mostly', 'just', 'guy', 'other', 'end', 'telephone', 'big', 'way', 'easily', 'utilize', 'comedy', 'Oswalt', 'become', 'known', 'loved', 'enthusiasm', 'Walter', 'new', 'found', 'heroics', 'also', 'extremely', 'perspective', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'short', 'story', 'film', 'based', 'original', '1947', 'film', 'most', 'appealing', 'aspect', '34', 'Walter', 'Mitty', '34', 'going', 'was', 'looked', 'very', 'similar', '34', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind.', '34', 'Even', 'when', ""'re"", 'waist', 'deep', 'film', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'reel', 'even', 'Walter', 'daydreaming', 'Life', 'magazine', 'motto', 'more', 'mainstay', 'storyline', '34', 'Walter', 'Mitty', '34', 'motto', 'almost', 'parallel', 'Alexander', 'Pope', 'Eloisa', 'Abelard', 'being', 'used', '34', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine.', '34', 'film', 'also', 'able', 'introduce', 'character', 'extremely', 'easy', 'relate', 'soft', 'spoken', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'uncomfortable', 'social', 'situations', 'mostly', 'failed', 'conquest', 'romance', 'struggled', 'bit', 'mumbling', 'buffoon', 'Walter', 'poster', 'child', 'voiceless', 'Seeing', 'Walter', 'marvelous', 'journey', 'unfold', 'hopeful', 'push', 'right', 'direction', 'uplifting', 'inspiring', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'finding', 'passion', 'interest', 'massive', 'sea', 'known', 'everyday', 'world', 'Walter', 'may', 'keep', 'imagination', 'always', 'burning', 'bright', 'making', 'life', 'interesting.Walter', 'adventurous', 'explosive', 'segments', '34', 'zoning', 'out', '34', 'are', 'strung', 'together', 'ton', 'humor', 'sure', 'get', 'fair', 'share', 'laughs', 'Walter', 'fight', 'Stretch', 'Armstrong', 'elevator', 'newly', 'appointed', 'boss', 'Ted', 'Hendricks', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'borrow', '34', 'Matrix', '34', '34', 'Terminator', '2', '34', 'even', 'chicken', 'fight', 'segments', '34', 'Family', 'Guy.', '34', '34', 'Benjamin', 'Button', '34', 'daydream', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'memorable', 'due', 'how', 'humorous', 'as', 'just', 'everything', 'Greenland.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'people', 'Walter', 'who', 'up', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'Newly', 'hired', 'Life', 'magazine', 'employee', 'Cheryl', 'Melhoff', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Walter', 'current', 'crush', 'Cheryl', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'living', 'support', 'son', 'going', 'divorce', 'Wiig', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'approachable', 'easy', 'talk', 'Her', '8220', 'Major', 'Tom', '8221', 'sequence', 'Greenland', 'not', 'only', 'major', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'quite', 'possibly', 'Wiig', '8217', 'standout', 'scene', 'Walter', 'also', 'up', 'photojournalist', 'named', 'Sean', ""O'Connell"", 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Penn', 'role', 'very', 'small', 'famous', 'photographer', ""n't"", 'let', 'fame', 'go', 'head', 'very', 'modest', 'not', 'having', 'stable', 'address', 'internet', 'practically', 'unreachable', 'times.', '34', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty', '34', 'captures', 'imagination', 'Walter', 'daydreams', 'home', 'Walter', 'awkward', 'behavior', 'inspiring', 'anyone', 'who', 'mostly', 'kept', 'years', 'Walter', 'unbelievable', 'journey', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'imagination', 'reality', 'collide', 'most', 'fantastic', 'ways', 'story', 'plain', 'ordinary', 'unexpected', 'people', 'becoming', 'extraordinary', 'dreams', 'coming', 'true', 'once', 'man', 'man', 'recognition', 'unthinkable', 'impossible', 'become', 'achievable', '34', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty.', '34']",N/A

They've tried to make this movie for 20 years, and the story of the making of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is ultimately more interesting than the movie itself.  Here are some clips from what I call ""The Secret Life of 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'"": (roll film!)-- Samuel Goldwyn Jr. came up with the idea in 1994, and Disney was enthusiastic.  Instead,-- New Line Cinema was chosen, because Goldwyn would retain creative input, and because they were on good terms with Jim Carrey, who was the first choice as Mitty-- First screenwriters: Babaloo Mandell, Lowell Ganz-- Ron Howard was first tapped to direct, but he decided to make ""EdTV"" instead-- ""Mitty"" languished for 5 years because no one could figure out how to make the 1939 Thurber story seem contemporary.  Finally, New Line asked Chuck Russell to rewrite the screenplay and direct.  But New Line pushed back the scheduled 2000 release-- In 2001, Goldywn sued New Line for breach of contract, claiming New Line was going to dump the project on another studio and thereby block any ""creative input"" from Goldwyn-- Goldwyn won the suit, taking the project to Paramount-- Paramount was working with DreamWorks on ""Lemony Snicket"", and Spielberg got everyone interested in Jim Carrey again as Mitty-- Spielberg agreed to direct, and brought in DreamWorks to help finance the project (DreamWorks was bought by Paramount in 2006)-- Zach Helm wrote another script-- Spielberg and DreamWorks, however, decided to bail on ""Mitty"" in favor of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Munich""-- Richard LaGravenese wrote another script, with the stated goal of going ""back to the short story and capture not only the content but the original spirit"", according to Goldwyn's kid John.  (Obviously, our ""Mitty"" isn't the LaGravenese version)-- In 2005, Mark Waters was tapped to direct, but Carrey bailed-- Enter Owen Wilson in the role of ""Mitty""-- Paramount lost the rights because it took too long to make the film.  Owen Wilson bailed over ""creative differences""; Scarlett Johansson was considered for the female lead but she never signed the contract-- Goldwyn took the project to 20th Century Fox in 2007-- Another script rewrite, this time by Jay Kogen, who tailored the script for Mike Myers, who was now tapped for ""Mitty""-- 2010.  Myers gone, Sacha Baron Cohen was announced as ""Mitty"".  Steven Conrad wrote another script (the one we have now, more or less); Gore Verbinski would direct-- 2011.  Ben Stiller was announced as ""Mitty"".  Verbinski gave up direction for a producers's credit, and Stiller himself would directWhew!  Now THAT'S an adventure, more fraught with danger than what Stiller faces in Iceland and Afghanistan in the actual movie.  I spent so much time describing the troubled production history of the movie (which will NOT be included on your Blu-Ray extras, collectors) because there's so little to say about what I just saw.  It's not *bad*, by any means.  Stiller proves himself to be somewhat of a revelation as a director: some of the shots, especially the overhead stuff early in the film at the Time-Life building, and the sequence where Mitty skateboards down a deserted Icelandic highway, are quite stunning.  Sean Penn has a nice moment in a cameo role as The Most Interesting Man in the World.  But this movie isn't the story of Thurber's Walter Mitty, who is a daydreamer and not a doer.  Rather, it's the story of Everyman, seething away in quiet desperation in his cubicle five days a week.  Finally, the shlub goes out and DOES something.  Naturally, the movie has been a smashing success with the 30-55 demographic -- also seething away in cubicles -- to whom it's targeted.  But this new, reimagined Mitty -- ok, this rebooted Mitty, if you must -- doesn't connect on a human level.  He's like a light switch: he's a drone, and then he's Indiana Jones.  He the product of a screenwriter more concerned with getting from Point A to Point B than with creating a real person.But the film is beautifully made, and it's pretty churlish to despise a movie that so firmly believes that travel can make us better people.

He shows the human side of a cloistered mind who never quite stepped out of his comfort zone as a man. In childhood he was an average kid who enjoyed skateboarding.  He had moments of &#34;dropping&#34; out of time even as a child.  After his father died he had to find a way to help his mother make ends meet and so he got a job. Still he had his moments of zoning out. All throughout life his mind would take him on adventures that he never felt comfortable endeavoring in.  Until he was forced to. With the take over of Life magazine by a dissembler who intended to make life a digital only venue he was forced to make some choices. His biggest choice was the choice to find a single picture. Somehow it got lost and he had to find it. It was the &#34;quintessential&#34; statement of what Life was all about. It was an adventure that he had only dreamed about before and it made a new person of him.I think you will love this movie for simplicity and for the adventure.,5,Stiller brings Mitty to life.,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,1039,"['just', 'love', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'reality', 'human', 'side', 'cloistered', 'mind', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'stepped', 'comfort', 'zone', 'man', 'childhood', 'was', 'average', 'kid', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'skateboarding', 'had', 'moments', '34', 'dropping', '34', 'time', 'even', 'child', 'father', 'died', 'had', 'find', 'way', 'help', 'mother', 'make', 'meet', 'so', 'got', 'job', 'Still', 'had', 'moments', 'zoning', 'out', 'life', 'mind', 'would', 'take', 'adventures', 'never', 'felt', 'comfortable', 'endeavoring', 'was', 'forced', 'take', 'Life', 'magazine', 'dissembler', 'who', 'intended', 'make', 'life', 'digital', 'only', 'venue', 'was', 'forced', 'make', 'choices', 'biggest', 'choice', 'was', 'choice', 'find', 'single', 'picture', 'Somehow', 'got', 'lost', 'had', 'find', 'was', '34', 'quintessential', '34', 'statement', 'what', 'Life', 'was', 'was', 'adventure', 'had', 'only', 'dreamed', 'before', 'made', 'new', 'person', 'him.I', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'simplicity', 'adventure']",N/A

1683986,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00H7KJRVY,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","Anyone expecting Ben Stiller to recycle the two principal intertexts for this story - the James Thurber story or the classic Danny Kaye comedy from 1947 - is likely to be highly disappointed.  Superficially the plot remains the same, with Stiller playing a put-upon employee of LIFE magazine who is bullied by the new boss Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), but eventually discovers himself as a result of a once-in-a-lifetime trip to find elusive photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), who possesses an elusive negative needed for the final print copy of the magazine.  Needless to say everything ends happily, with Mitty discovering to his delight that the photograph celebrates the work of all LIFE's employees - journalists, printers, editors, photo-staff - who made the magazine such an American institution.  He also manages to convince the love of his life, Cheryl Melhoff (Kirsten Wiig) of the sincerity of his intentions.  At heart, however, WALTER MITTY is a story of the importance of discovering yourself, even if the odds seem stacked against you.  Walter learns to follow his inclinations, and by doing so fulfills his mother Edna's (Shirley MacLaine's) aspirations for him.  Stiller gives a delightful performance, his character gradually changing from one of wide-eyed stoicism (which provokes him to daydream) into a person of quiet strength, who is not frightened of confronting Hendricks and telling the boss exactly what he thinks.  At another level WALTER MITTY can be seen as an elegy for LIFE magazine, that bastion of American journalism, which has now become an online-only journal due to falling sales and changing reader preferences.  The film uses archive material to show how it chronicled all the major events and personalities of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and how its staff (for the most part) were dedicated to their work.  It's the kind of magazine that doesn't deserve to be taken over by superficial ignoramuses such as Hendricks, whose principal concern is for profitability rather than journalistic integrity.",4,Any Resemblance to the Thurber Source or the Kaye Film is Purely Coincidental,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,2063,"['Anyone', 'expecting', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'recycle', 'two', 'principal', 'intertexts', 'story', 'James', 'Thurber', 'story', 'classic', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'comedy', '1947', 'likely', 'be', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'Superficially', 'plot', 'same', 'Stiller', 'playing', 'put-upon', 'employee', 'LIFE', 'magazine', 'who', 'bullied', 'new', 'boss', 'Ted', 'Hendricks', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'eventually', 'result', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'trip', 'find', 'elusive', 'photographer', 'Sean', ""O'Connell"", 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'elusive', 'negative', 'needed', 'final', 'print', 'copy', 'magazine', 'Needless', 'say', 'everything', 'ends', 'happily', 'Mitty', 'discovering', 'delight', 'photograph', 'work', 'LIFE', 'employees', 'journalists', 'printers', 'editors', 'photo-staff', 'who', 'made', 'magazine', 'American', 'institution', 'also', 'convince', 'love', 'life', 'Cheryl', 'Melhoff', 'Kirsten', 'Wiig', 'sincerity', 'intentions', 'heart', 'however', 'WALTER', 'MITTY', 'story', 'importance', 'discovering', 'even', 'odds', 'seem', 'stacked', 'Walter', 'follow', 'inclinations', 'doing', 'so', 'fulfills', 'mother', 'Edna', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'aspirations', 'Stiller', 'delightful', 'performance', 'character', 'gradually', 'changing', 'one', 'wide-eyed', 'stoicism', 'daydream', 'person', 'quiet', 'strength', 'who', 'not', 'frightened', 'confronting', 'Hendricks', 'telling', 'boss', 'exactly', 'what', 'level', 'WALTER', 'MITTY', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'elegy', 'LIFE', 'magazine', 'bastion', 'American', 'journalism', 'now', 'become', 'online-only', 'journal', 'due', 'falling', 'sales', 'changing', 'reader', 'preferences', 'film', 'archive', 'material', 'show', 'how', 'chronicled', 'major', 'events', 'personalities', 'twentieth', 'early', 'twenty-first', 'centuries', 'how', 'staff', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'dedicated', 'work', 'kind', 'magazine', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'taken', 'over', 'superficial', 'ignoramuses', 'such', 'Hendricks', 'principal', 'concern', 'profitability', 'rather', 'journalistic', 'integrity']",N/A

Ben Stiller is wonderful in the leading role, both as a mousey, zoned-out ghost at the journey's outset and the large, confident individual he becomes, and the awkward chemistry he shares with Kristen Wiig is just right.

1683988,A1FDJ2PJRJ7DK1,B00H7KJRVY,Eric Marcy,"[6, 9]","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty came out of nowhere and is most likely here to stay. I first saw the trailer for this Ben Stiller comedic drama (or dramatic comedy perhaps?) before watching The Desolation of Smaug, and the unique mix of stunning visuals, inspiring music, and humor intrigued me if nothing else. Never being one for the mainstream comedy stars of today, I filed the film away under &#8220;films I might check out eventually&#8221; as opposed to the more urgent &#8220;must watch&#8221; area of my mind. But in the past week, when several friends mentioned the film to me in passing, and the opportunity presented itself to head to the theater, the decision was made to see Mitty in the spur of the moment. I hoped to be intrigued by this curious film that straddles the line between the epic and the absurd, but I never expected it to be so poignant, so enjoyable, so inspiring, and most importantly: so timely.Evidently, Stiller&#8217;s Mitty is loosely inspired by a James Thurber short story, which was also previously adapted into a film starring Danny Kaye in 1947. I knew none of this until after watching Stiller&#8217;s version, so I really have no idea how to compare Stiller&#8217;s version to the previous incarnations of the story, but I do know that this new film is a remarkable achievement on its own merits. Both directed by and featuring Stiller in the title role, Walter Mitty is a negative assets manager for Life magazine who lives a rather mundane and boring life processing photographic negatives. He is single, has a secret crush on coworker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), is about to lose his job as Life transitions to online only, is tormented by transition manager Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), and regularly zones out, participating in fanciful daydreams of how he wishes his life would go. When he is tasked by famous photographer Sean O&#8217;Connell (Sean Penn) with providing Life with the &#8220;quintessential&#8221; photograph of the photographer&#8217;s career, negative 25, only to find that it is missing, Walter Mitty is faced with the task of hunting down either photograph or photographer, which results in him stepping beyond the mundane and into a globe-trotting adventure.Mitty works on a remarkable number of levels. The film is funny and clever, but also genuine and earnest. Walter Mitty is a wonderful character because, as he is played by Stiller, he is incredibly relatable. We have all been Walter Mitty at some point in our lives. We have all agonized over a crush, awkwardly fumbled over words with those we are trying to impress, felt as if we were going nowhere with our lives, zoned out for a moment and dreamed of some fantastic ending to the story that is the present moment, gotten fed up with that boss at work that places corporate goals and his own success above (what it seems to us) all human decency. We have all felt oppressively lonely in the midst of a large group of people. We have all looked to the far off horizons and longed not to simply read about that greater life we dream of, but instead experience it for ourselves. Stiller, in his portrayal of a man who feels lost in the cogs of modernity, a man who (ironically) is lost in Life, has hit upon the frustrations and longings of anyone who is human. We do not laugh at Walter Mitty. We laugh because we know his struggles, for we have all been in his shoes.The first ten minutes of the film are brilliant, immediately prompting us to empathize with Walter as he fills out his checkbook in his bland apartment, then proceeds to agonize over sending a virtual &#8220;wink&#8221; to Cheryl on eHarmony. His finger hovers over the computer, quaking with anxiety. He is forced to wrestle with both his own lack of courage and technical difficulties before heading off to work, where a great emphasis is placed on how he is just one solitary office drone among many off to do the same drab thing. It is all brought to a head when he sees Cheryl at work, and we realize what a simple and yet profound statement Stiller is making about our increasingly technological world. For all of our increased social connection through technology, in the masses of people present in our cities, are we really any closer to each other than before? No, we are in fact more distant and separated. Yes, it is a question we have hopefully all asked ourselves before, but in its first act, Mitty draws attention to many of the gulfs so prevalent in modern life remarkably well, and slowly but surely (through the surprisingly profound motto of Life magazine itself) begins to expose us to a far better way of living, one that is far more satisfying than even the most fantastic of Walter&#8217;s daydreams.When Walter ventures beyond New York, his journey in pursuit of the elusive photographer and photograph takes him to some of the most wondrous and beautiful places on Earth, and the cinematography and camera work is breathtaking. Just as Walter as a man begins to transcend his previous dull existence, Mitty as a film begins to transcend simply being a fun, interesting and empathetic film and grows to become a journey of profound discovery that is both poignant and epic. He encounters a remarkably interesting cast of characters on his way, and it is a joy to see Walter gradually realize that participating in the beautiful play that is life itself is not limited to the dream-world as he once believed.I could continue to go on about the wonders of the story itself, but I fear spoiling some of the wonder of the discovery that Walter undergoes throughout his outlandish adventures. Mitty consistently pushes the bounds of reality, but only to a point that is pleasantly imaginative and quixotic. The acting is superb, and the music is not simply an accompaniment but an integral part of the story. The humor and daydreams are a delight because they are so real and relatable. We have all been Walter Mitty, and we all long to break out of the mundane life that the modern world hands us that feels soulless and bereft of meaning. Mitty tells us to step out into the wider world, pursue  our dreams; do not just observe life through the lens of the modern world&#8217;s fake social constructs and interactions (looking at you, social media), but participate in the beautiful.By the end (or perhaps the beginning) of Walter Mitty&#8217;s adventure, however, we have also learned something else, something far more profound. Though we must transcend the mundane, there is a level of tediousness and disappointment that cannot be avoided. But even in what we see as pointless, boring, and drudgery, there is an opportunity to do something greater, to live a life of meaning and significance wherever we find ourselves, regardless of whether we are recognized, regardless of whether we are traveling the world as Walter eventually does. Even Walter&#8217;s childhood experiences and hobbies, seemingly insignificant, are revealed to have weight and importance. &#8220;To see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel&#8221;,  that is the purpose of life wherever we are, and for bringing our attention to that profound truth in such an artful and entertaining way, we cannot thank the makers of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty enough.***For more reviews, visit my blog &#34;Pulling On The Push Door&#34;",5,An ambitious and heartwarming masterpiece...,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,7339,"['Secret', 'Life',

That show was brilliant, short-lived and pretty much forgotten.Stiller is a remarkable talent, although he has often worked in stunted scenarios that allowed not much room for Ben Stiller to be Ben Stiller. This is Stiller being what Stiller wants to be. I saw this film because my daughter, after three cancelled flights back to Chicago, was in town another night. I suggested this film simply for something to do, and it was playing at the cheap place. Otherwise I probably would not have seen it, in a little bit the same way Walter Mitty would not have broken from his secret, imagined world had he not simply decided, for real, to go find an elusive photographer.I'm afraid I have yet to read Thurber's story, but Stiller's adaptation is simply an admonition to get up off our butts and actually do something, especially something for which there is no app. With incredible landscape shots, snippets of cultures so very not American, quirky transportation, and at times a representation of digital technology serving people rather than enslaving us, he succeeds in a very fresh way. This film is also often very funny. I kind of feel sorry for those too cool for school folks who didn't or wouldn't plug in. It's disappointing this film was ignored awards-wise. It's at least equal to &#34;Twelve Years a Slave&#34; or &#34;Saving Mr. Banks,&#34; and has it all over something like &#34;Philomena.&#34;",5,Wow!,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,1629,"['shortage', 'there', 'not', 'good', 'reviews', 'film', 'curiously', 'not', 'here', 'Amazon', '34', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty', '34', 'reminds', 'Stiller', 'show', 'FOX', 'when', 'network', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'show', 'was', 'brilliant', 'short-lived', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten.Stiller', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'often', 'worked', 'stunted', 'scenarios', 'allowed', 'not', 'much', 'room', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'be', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Stiller', 'being', 'what', 'Stiller', 'be', 'saw', 'film', 'daughter', 'three', 'cancelled', 'flights', 'back', 'Chicago', 'was', 'town', 'night', 'suggested', 'film', 'simply', 'something', 'do', 'was', 'playing', 'cheap', 'place', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'bit', 'same', 'way', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'broken', 'secret', 'imagined', 'world', 'had', 'not', 'simply', 'decided', 'real', 'go', 'find', 'elusive', 'photographer.I', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'have', 'yet', 'read', 'Thurber', 'story', 'Stiller', 'adaptation', 'simply', 'admonition', 'get', 'up', 'off', 'butts', 'actually', 'do', 'something', 'especially', 'something', 'app', 'incredible', 'landscape', 'shots', 'snippets', 'cultures', 'so', 'very', 'not', 'American', 'quirky', 'transportation', 'times', 'representation', 'digital', 'technology', 'serving', 'people', 'rather', 'enslaving', 'very', 'fresh', 'way', 'film', 'also', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'kind', 'feel', 'sorry', 'too', 'cool', 'school', 'folks', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'plug', 'disappointing', 'film', 'was', 'ignored', 'awards-wise', 'least', 'equal', '34', 'Twelve', 'Slave', '34', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'something', '34', 'Philomena.', '34']",N/A

1683996,AU10YGO10MUCA,B00H7KJRVY,Gary Lee,"[0, 0]","In his famous short story, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"" James Thurber created the ultimate Caspar Milquetoast.  Mitty's daydreams in which he imagined himself the dashing hero provided his only escape from his drab, uneventful life and endless browbeating by his domineering spouse.Fine on the page, but not exactly the stuff of riveting cinema.  The Hollywood solution?  Enter Ben Stiller as the latest big screen incarnation of dull Walter.He's the chief negative editor for LIFE, the world's most famous photojournalism magazine, in the heart of bustling Manhattan.Boring.He's charged with producing the final cover of the print edition before the periodical goes exclusively on-line.Tedious, for sure.He loses the money shot, just as the corporate big wigs who have taken over the publication are screaming for the negative.Yawn.So, with the missing photo as the MacGuffin, Walter sets off alone to the earth's rugged places to track down the elusive, Galen Rowell-type adventure photographer Sean O'Connell, who took the picture.I mean, were it not for the free company coffee, I don't how this guy manages to stay awake through the workday.Obviously, director Stiller and his screenwriters jettisoned most everything from Thurber's quirky, off-beat, slightly unhinged story but the title and the notion of a chronic daydreamer.  While Walter's fantasies were the entire point of the short story, the fantasy sequences in the movie are its weakest part, perhaps because the whole, charming film is so daffy.  With such an intriguing life, it's not clear why Walter needs to fantasize to such an extreme degree.  He virtually blacks out at times, which, we learn from his mother near the end of the movie, is not his salvation but nearly his downfall--just the opposite of Thurber's character in the written story.One fantasy sequence in the film--a superheroes-style battle between Walter and his antagonistic boss--seems nothing more than an attempt to bring in the comic book crowd.  When Walter sets off in pursuit of the missing photo, his coworker Cheryl (likeable Kristen Wiig), for whom he has romantic longings, remains ever-available not only in his fantasies but on his cell phone (even on top of a mountain in Afghanistan, where rock-solid Afghani infrastructure guarantees crystal-clear reception ).  The worst fantasy sequence, in which Walter imagines himself as an old man dying in elderly Cheryl's arms, is just stupid and repulsive.Like James Thurber's famous character, this film is a wanna be.  It wants to be a typical Hollywood rom-com, with a dash of action-adventure flick, but its true heart keeps peeping through.  This film is an ontological reflection.A what?It's about being--being true to yourself, being the real you, letting your light shine.Which is not to say it is Deep and Serious.  Hardly.  It's a goofy mess of a movie, but the care it takes with its layered details, implausible as the action may be, is one of its pleasures.  The travelogue is breathtaking as Walter pursues O'Connell, (nicely underplayed by Sean Penn) from the sub-Arctic to the Middle East.  The characters, as opposed to Thurber's cartoons, are fleshed out and believable.  The set-up may be Hollywood crazy, but the emotions are real, as deftly played by Stiller, Wiig, Penn, and Shirley MacLaine as Walter's alert and caring mother.  Stiller has made a career of passive characters.  He does not so much act as react to others in a scene, which makes him prefect to play the always accommodating Walter, a perpetual spectator (hence his photo editor job) .This tender-hearted movie's frequent pauses and hesitations are what gives it weight.  The filmmakers tip their hat as to their real concerns in the crucial scene where Walter at last catches up with O'Connell.  It is their first face-to-face meeting, but their relationship is already profound because Walter has been receiving dispatches from his star photographic contributor and turning them into magic on the magazine's pages for 16 years.  The depth of the emotions in the wonderfully subdued scene reminded me, wild as the stretch might seem, of the explosion of unstated feeling that occurs when Rick and Ilsa first see each other once again in CASABLANCA.  When O'Connell observes (referring to the snow leopard in his lens), ""Beautiful things don't ask for attention,"" he sums up the theme of the film--Walter's own underappreciated beauty, especially of himself.The plot is unpredictable, careening all over the place, the storytelling is often inventive, the dialogue rich, the acting first-rate, the scenery superb, and there are some laughs and some throat-catching moments along the way.  So don't worry too much about the ontological meaning of it all.  As you'll see in the fine and touching finale, THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY is a great date movie.  It may leave you with an afterglow about how good it feels to be you.",4,"""Beautiful things don't ask for attention.""",1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,4920,"['famous', 'short', 'story', 'Secret',

Who can't related to a lonely and frustrated day-dreamer longing for love and success? Ben Stiller's heart was in the right place when making this film but his film falls so far from its potential. Ben Stiller, Kristin Wiig (who has never looked lovelier), Shirley MacLaine, Adam Scott (in an annoyingy fkae beard) and Sean Penn give us their best but nothing can save a film that is short on story and enthusiasm.Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is in charge of photographic negatives in this digital age. He works for LIFE magazine, which about to publish it issue (which, of course, happened years ago). Mitty's life suddenly takes him around the world in search of a photographer  Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) and a missing negative whose picture will be on the final cover of LIFE. Along the way, Walter is infatuated with a coworker Cherly (Kristin Wiig) who he tries to connect with on eHarmony. MITTY does seem to turn into a filmed commercial for eHarmony, Papa John's Pizza, Cinnabon and others. The advertising connection seems over the top at times and the film becomes a running commercial for several products.There is some stunning photography in THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY and it helps overcome the shortcomings in the story. Walter ends up in Iceland, Greenland, the Himalayas and Afghanistan. I checked the credits and filming was done in Iceland and British Columbia so it appears the crew did at least go to ICELAND and the setting is just gorgeous. We get to see Ben Stiller show some moves on a skateboard (with the daring moves being done by a stunt skateboarder). Another plus is seeing Kristin Wiig in a serious role. No slapstick comedy..just a sweet lady trying to survive in a tough world and find happiness.Stiller has made a career of playing the lovable loser with a gentle heart. His Walter Mitty is no different.  Stiller's eyes light up the screen as does Kristin Wiig's beauty. Sadly, there is just so much lacking in this film as we struggle to care about the story and the people.",3,WELL-INTENTIONED BUT DISAPPOINTING IN THE END,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,2125,"['lot', 'like', 'THE', 'SECRET', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'WALTER', 'MITTY', 'yet', 'film', 'up', 'major', 'disappointment', 'Who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'related', 'lonely', 'frustrated', 'day-dreamer', 'longing', 'love', 'success', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'heart', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'when', 'making', 'film', 'film', 'falls', 'so', 'far', 'potential', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Kristin', 'Wiig', 'who', 'never', 'looked', 'lovelier', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'annoyingy', 'fkae', 'beard', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'give', 'best', 'nothing', 'can', 'save', 'film', 'short', 'story', 'enthusiasm.Walter', 'Mitty', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'charge', 'photographic', 'negatives', 'digital', 'age', 'LIFE', 'magazine', 'publish', 'issue', 'course', 'happened', 'years', 'ago', 'Mitty', 'life', 'suddenly', 'world', 'search', 'photographer', 'Sean', ""O'Connell"", 'Sean', 'Penn', 'missing', 'negative', 'picture', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'cover', 'LIFE', 'way', 'Walter', 'infatuated', 'coworker', 'Cherly', 'Kristin', 'Wiig', 'who', 'connect', 'eHarmony', 'MITTY', 'seem', 'turn', 'filmed', 'commercial', 'eHarmony', 'Papa', 'John', 'Pizza', 'Cinnabon', 'others', 'advertising', 'connection', 'top', 'times', 'film', 'running', 'commercial', 'several', 'stunning', 'photography', 'THE', 'SECRET', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'WALTER', 'MITTY', 'overcome', 'shortcomings', 'story', 'Walter', 'up', 'Iceland', 'Greenland', 'Himalayas', 'Afghanistan', 'checked', 'credits', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'Iceland', 'British', 'Columbia', 'crew', 'did', 'least', 'go', 'ICELAND', 'setting', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'get', 'see', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'show', 'moves', 'skateboard', 'daring', 'moves', 'being', 'done', 'stunt', 'skateboarder', 'seeing', 'Kristin', 'Wiig', 'serious', 'role', 'slapstick', 'comedy..just', 'sweet', 'lady', 'trying', 'survive', 'tough', 'world', 'find', 'happiness.Stiller', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'lovable', 'loser', 'gentle', 'heart', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'different', 'Stiller', 'eyes', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'Kristin', 'Wiig', 'beauty', 'Sadly', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'lacking', 'film', 'struggle', 'care', 'story', 'people']",N/A

I must tell you, I have never been so floored by a movie in all my life. It's the kind of experience I was expecting to get from Gravity and didn't. I was shocked. This is partly due to the fact that I am not the world's biggest Ben Stiller fan. Slapstick comedy is a delicate thing for me, and I certainly don't enjoy it if I am watching the comedian copy someone else's decade's old jokes (which is more often the case then not).This movie is a work of art. The critics hated it. It is a true journey of heart, mind, and soul, and the movie is not simply about a man that wants the attention of this one girl. It's about a man waking up and experiencing life after having put it to the side for years to do the right thing for his family. Amazingly cast. Floored (and astonished) by Ben Stiller's acting and direction. I give this an 8.5 on IMDb, and that's more than I gave Temple Grandin. I will have to own this one (which means shell out good money for the bluray), and I'm guessing I'll end up buying many copies, as I did for Time Traveler's Wife (the book, not the horrible movie) because I must give a copy to everyone that hasn't experienced it.Do yourself a favor and go with someone that will sink into it and give it the respect it deserves, or go on your own and be awakened.

I have to admit, my family was a little gun-shy about watching something with Sean Penn in it (he's not even listed in the credits I've just reviewed).

Playing the title character in his 2013 remake of THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY, at first Stiller seems to be the latter as the man who gets so lost in his imagination he fails to apply it to the situations that inspire it.  However, without giving away the story, I'll say when Mitty leaves New York City and what we see next is in the mind of the director Stiller as opposed to that of the man played by him, give THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY credit for daring to challenge the audience with something I, for one, would not have expected.THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY will get you to root for Walter Mitty as you see him pursue what you thought he may have been content to just visualize.  I just wish it had a little more of Adam Scott as the super-jerk boss Ted, the character we root against.  But there is just enough of Sean Penn as a legendary photographer Mitty must find to save his job; a lesser film would have had the two team up once Mitty at last locates him but instead the great actor exits as cagily as he entered, no aura lost.Finally, THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY ends with as good a payoff as you will ever see.

S. should be seen.  New release choices are further complicated by numerous ""foreign"" films that never make it here and the countless tens of thousands in movie archives.  I took a pass on this remake of the 1947 film starring Danny Kaye.  It finally came time to catch up with it on Blu ray and I was pleasantly surprised that I found it better than I expected.Ben Stiller stars (and also directed) as Walter Mitty.  In this version of James Thurber's short story, Mitty is a basement dweller working for ""Life"" magazine.  Specifically he handles the negatives of shot film before inclusion in the magazine.  Walter is a mild-mannered man who is prone to elaborate daydreams where he briefly escapes to a fantasy world where he sees himself as somewhat of a hero who stands up for what is right.  His sister (Kathryn Hahn) just says he's zoning out.  Walter has his romantic sights set on Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), a newly hired co-worker.  But Walter, lacking in confidence, struggles to ask her out.Walter's world is disrupted when ""Life"" announces it will become a web-based magazine only and will be shutting down traditional print publications.  The ""transition"" manager, Ted (Adam Scott) is an arrogant, bearded jerk as are the two ass-kissers who assist him.  ""Life's"" final cover page is to feature a photo taken by Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), a world famous photographer.  The specific photo has been sent to Walter along with several others.  But the specific photo #25 is missing.Walter's search for the photo go beyond fantasy and he sets out to find the photographer.  This leads him on an unlikely journey to Greenland and ultimately Iceland where he finally locates O'Connell.  Sean tells Walter that he had it all along.  I won't spoil the location or the shot itself but it contains the proper payoff.  Some of the adventurism of Walter is a bit hard to buy given his milquetoast personality but you just have to go with it.  The photography of the North Atlantic countries is beautiful and Stiller's direction is solid.  Wiig takes a supportive role and creates a character who is sweet and honest.  While this may not be one of the great films, it is certainly worthy of a look.The Blu ray transfer is quite good, no make that excellent.  It has a 1080p video resolution and uses a 2.40:1 aspect ratio so bars at the top and bottom of most screens is normal.  The picture and especially the colors are striking.  The ever present blue skies and dark blue ocean provide a respectful re-creation of cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh's work.  The audio is something very special.  The package comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track which provides an enthralling audio experience.  It does an equally good job replicating the office environment where Walter works and really shines in those thunderous scenes where Walter is airlifted onto a freighter in the middle of the ocean.  Then there are the panoramic shots high in the Himalayas where it is mystically quiet but for the sound of a few animals and guides playing soccer in the distance.  There are numerous 5.1 options available in other languages as well.  Subtitle options are numerous.  Here is a list: English SDH, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Latvian, Lithuanian, Chinese, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovenian, Turkish, and Ukranian.

1684059,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B00H7KJRVY,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[6, 9]","Ben Stiller&#8217;s Walter Mitty of 2013 bears a passing resemblance to Danny Kaye&#8217;s of 1947, and none at all to James Thurber&#8217;s original creation (in which a hen-pecked husband, who inhabits a short story about five pages long, is sent out to buy overshoes and dog biscuits while his wife has her hair done). So those professional critics who complain (and some have) that Stiller doesn&#8217;t capture Thurber&#8217;s nuanced social commentary are talking through their hats.Nor, as far as I know, did Thurber leave behind Tolkienesque appendices of the sort that might underpin the two hour rollercoaster on show. It is a story of derring-do, adversity and high-jinks only matched by the development trajectory of this script. In its decade-long passage through the hands of agents, writers, producers, studios and directors, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was also dunked in the arctic ocean, shot at by Afghan warlords and abandoned in Himalayan wastelands, before falling for its final release into the loving arms of Ben Stiller who found himself not only leading the cast but directing the film as well.Usually films with this sort of midwifery are a disaster. This one&#8217;s a peach. I&#8217;m inclined to give Stiller much of the credit, though I dare say Steve Conrad&#8217;s screenplay didn&#8217;t write itself.On a big screen, it is stunning. This is what Hollywood blockbusters should be like: imaginative, inventive, engaging, beautiful, sweeping, clever, well observed, well acted, and fun. Stiller demonstrates himself to be a subtler comic than many of his peers (Jim Carey was associated with this picture at one point) and an outstanding actor: his transition from biro-pocketed nerd in the basement to swashbuckling global explorer is a joy to behold. For a little guy with sticky-outy ears, he is a surprisingly credible leading man. There is real chemistry between Stiller and Kirsten Wiig.That said, Walter Mitty is made by, features, and speaks to the people of a certain demographic - mine: mid-40s toilers who spend their private moments aghast that their lives are slipping away unremarked, and their public ones putting on brave faces and avoiding the inevitable conclusion that their toils might have been for naught.This film counsels not just seizure of the day, but also that it hasn&#8217;t been in vain: the beautiful, as Sean Penn remarks, don&#8217;t ask for attention.Ironically, Walter Mitty learns of his own beauty only when he flees his gilded cage.

1684061,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00H7KJRVY,Paul Allaer,"[30, 39]","""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (2013 release; 114 min.) brings the story of Walter Mitty (played by Ben Stiller), an employee at Life Magazine who is your average guy but with a severe case of daydreaming. Walter has a secret crush on Cheryl (played by Kristen Wiig), a co-worker. At the beginning of the movie, Walter tries to send a ""wink"" to Cheryl on the eHarmony dating site, but it doesn't work, so Walter talks to Todd, a customer representative, to try and fix the issue. On the very same day of Walter's 42nd birthday, it is announced that Life is being acquired and that the last issue, coming out in 2 1/2 weeks, will feature a cover shot by famous but reclusive photographer Sean O'Connell (played by Sean Penn). O'Connell sent the negative to Walter's care, but Walter cannot locate it, forcing him to track down O'Connell. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie (based on a short story) is a remake of the original Walter Mitty movie, released in 1947. Second, the movie is epic in scope and eye-candy from start to finish, with some astonishing visuals, in particular when the movie is set in Greenland and Iceland. In my mind, the movie is as much a travelogue as it is an emotional story. Third, speaking of the movie's emotional pull, it very much succeeds and I will admit tearing up on more than one occasion. The best scene in the movie for me is when Walter is in Iceland, debating his options with himself, when Cheryl appears out of the blue in a dream sequence, singing David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"". Just superb. But the entire movie is every bit as epic as the trailer (which I had seen several times in recent weeks) make you lead to believe. Towards the very end of this incredible journey, Walter meets up with Todd, the eHarmony guy, and Todd blurts out ""It's like Indiana Jones becoming the lead singer of the Strokes!"", and that just about sums it up. Speaking of the Strokes, no, their music is not featured in the movie, but a bunch of other great indie music is, including Of Monsters and Men, Rogue Wave, Junip, and Jose Gonzalez (of Junip), just to name those. Check out the latter's ""Step Out"", an epic-sounding tune that is the unofficial anthem/theme song of the movie. (The soundtrack is available here on Amazon, for anyone interested.)""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" opened today here in Cincinnati and the late matinee showing I saw this at, was nicely attended. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, as it turned out to be just as good as the trailer made me think it would. This is the perfect movie for a family with young teenagers to catch over the holidays.

Thankfully, now having seen it, those fears have been assuaged. This film, while still a little overly earnest, is heartfelt and has a good message. And outside of the NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM movies, it's also one of the few films Ben Stiller has done that's appropriate for families. The story is about Walter Mitty who, in this film version, works for Life Magazine as a negative asset manager. Basically, he keeps track of all of the photographs that come in. As the magazine is in transition to becoming online only, a famous photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) sends in a roll for use in the final print issue. In particular, one negative (#25) is to be used as the cover. However, it's missing and Walter has to track it down and find it. This serves as the springboard for Walter, a rather insular fellow who tends to zone out and daydream, to get out and make something of his life. One thing I really liked about this movie was the way in which it seamlessly blended Walter's fantasies with the real world. They offered insight into an otherwise closed-off personality (at least in the beginning), and were realized visually in a very cool way. I also enjoyed the overall visual aesthetic of the film, which had lots of wintry blues, grays and whites. The characters were satisfactorily drawn, although none of them were terribly deep, save Walter. I thought Kristin Wiig gave a nice performance, but her character was never really given much to do other than be the object of Walter's affections. On the downside, for all of the buildup to a few things which I won't spoil here, the end result is a bit underwhelming. Still, the journey to the end (and to the discoveries found there) is an interesting one. This movie turned out to be much better than I expected. It's a fun film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

Briggs,"[1, 1]","Secret Life of Walter MittyWalter Mitty is, according to IMDB, ""A day-dreamer (who) escapes his anonymous life by disappearing into a world of fantasies filled with heroism, romance and action. When his job is threatened, he takes action in the real world embarking on a global journey that turns into an adventure more extraordinary than anything he could have ever imagined.""  From the first frame to the rolling credits this film is a visual masterpiece.  But I didn't expect it to resonate so personally with me.  Ben Stiller, Kristin Wiig, Sean Penn, Shirley Maclaine and a cast of literally thousands, 15,000 to be precise, create the world in which Walter Mitty, Negative Asset Manager for Life Magazine, lives and we get to be the audience.His inner world is much more interesting than his real life.  It's the last days of Life Magazine as it transitions from print Goliath to online David.  He manages to embody all of our collective regrets and insecurities in one sweet package.  Of course it's also a love story.  Aren't all the best movies about love at some level?  The musical direction is as superb as the visual direction and he has chosen to make sure transitional scenes are from a point of view invisible to the actors and visible only to us and it works nicely to move the forward story and to add grace notes and punctuation to the unfolding drama.  Life is either something that happens to you or is something you make happen.  And it is Life Magazine's motto that guides our story.  That motto was ""To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life.""The corporate bearded grim reaper has just told everyone it's their last issue and the famous recluse photographer, Sean O'Connell, has sent the negative that will be the issue's last cover shot.  Walter has received the film but negative 25, the cover shot, is missing.  His abusive childlike gleeful grave digging new manager plays the role of ""rubber"" of I'm rubber your glue fame.  At its heart it's a movie about Life that's about life but it's disguised as a Mcguffin type film wherein the object of the protagonist's search, negative 25, is in none of the places the film takes us.  As with Dorothy, of Oz, it was always not just at home but within him the whole time to make the magic real.This film resonated with me because my Dad was Sean O'Connell, the wise man whose camera provides a view of the world that can only comes through the lens of that camera by virtue of what the photographer sees and how he sees it.  Photographers are the men and women whose eyes are, once opened, never closed and this film made me think of Dad.  Dad made his way through this world in his own way.  Dad, too, was a photographer and he didn't just teach me how to frame a shot and show me how visual arts were either manipulation of light or space, he taught me how to be a human.

If you're expecting another dodge ball or meet the parents, you'll be disappointed but this movie truly is great!",5,Refreshing and Fun!,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,561,"['Anymore', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'sequels', 'super', 'heroes', 'poorly', 'done', 'repeats', 'storylines', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'often', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'happy', 'exception', 'movie', 'happy', 'refreshingly', 'original', 'funny', 'One', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'best', 'performances', 'actor', ""'m"", 'usually', 'luke', 'warm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'most', 'movie.Just', 'know', 'thoughtful', 'comedy', 'not', 'slapstick', 'humor', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'dodge', 'ball', 'meet', 'parents', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'truly', 'great']",N/A

I'm not very fond of, flash thinking in the middle of the screen type stories, so that was a bit of a turn off for me. But the movie was good and it was nice tho see Shawn Penn again.
