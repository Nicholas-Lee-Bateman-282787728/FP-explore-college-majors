Nick doesn't have a wedding ring on his finger. Huh?3.  Valerie sings I'm Every Woman and goes into the audience and sits in another guys lap. Huh?4.  They sing a rendition with a gay guy about being in a gay club with each of them singing about a gay character. Huh?5.  Nick's song was called Born This Way. Huh?People I'm sorry, maybe I'm naive but Ashford & Simpson broke my heart with this DVD.  Reading between the lines you could clearly see where they were going with this.  I believe that Nick had sort of a coming out of the closet party.  One of the greatest songwriter duo's of all time have what I believe to be an openly flawed relationship!!  No wonder Freddy Jackson was there.  It hurt because I held them to such high standards.  But it's just showbiz right?

1219071,A1QINNIQ5T1G3I,B001N5BDLQ,Shye212,"[1, 1]","Is it just me or does anyone else share in my dis-pleasure of Ashford & Simpson always concentrating more on the songs they wrote for other singers vs. their own brilliant repetoire whenever they perform live in concert ?  While I love EVERYTHING Nick & Val have written, produced, etc...for notable singers like Marvin Gaye/Tami Terrell, Diana Ross, and a slew of others, I fell in love with their sound as a result of listening to the material they specifically wrote for themselves. I still listen to the ""Is It Still Good To Ya?"" project as if it came out yesterday...lol  To my surprise, none of the songs from that stellar recording are featured on this DVD. The highlight IMO of this concert is their rousing and almost gospel-like rendition of ""Gime Me Something Real"".  I was also pleasantly surprised to finally hear them sing one of my all time favorites ""Stay Free"". On a darker note...literally they sang 5 completely forgetable songs they wrote for the soundtrack of a yet to be released movie entitled ""Invisable Life"".  When I think of the songs they could have performed in lieu of these, my blood curdles.  The DVD is a keeper just because well, it's Ashford & Simpson, but I don't see myself reaching to play this DVD again anytime soon.",3,Are The Songs From Your Own Albums Still Good To Ya?,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,1256,"['just', 'anyone', 'else', 'share', 'dis-pleasure', 'Ashford', 'Simpson', 'always', 'concentrating', 'more', 'songs', 'wrote', 'other', 'singers', 'vs.', 'own', 'brilliant', 'repetoire', 'whenever', 'perform', 'live', 'concert', 'love', 'EVERYTHING', 'Nick', 'Val', 'have', 'written', 'produced', 'etc', 'notable', 'singers', 'Marvin', 'Gaye/Tami', 'Terrell', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'slew', 'others', 'fell', 'love', 'sound', 'result', 'listening', 'material', 'specifically', 'wrote', 'still', 'listen', 'Still', 'Good', 'Ya', 'project', 'came', 'out', 'yesterday', 'lol', 'surprise', 'none', 'songs', 'stellar', 'recording', 'are', 'featured', 'DVD', 'highlight', 'IMO', 'concert', 'rousing', 'almost', 'gospel-like', 'rendition', 'Gime', 'Me', 'Something', 'Real', 'was', 'also', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'finally', 'hear', 'sing', 'one', 'time', 'Stay', 'Free', 'darker', 'note', 'literally', 'sang', '5', 'completely', 'forgetable', 'songs', 'wrote', 'soundtrack', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Invisable', 'Life', 'When', 'think', 'songs', 'could', 'have', 'performed', 'lieu', 'blood', 'curdles', 'DVD', 'keeper', 'just', 'because', 'well', 'Ashford', 'Simpson', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'reaching', 'play', 'DVD', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A
1219072,A2561PTXI27C9G,B001N5BDLQ,Unique,"[0, 0]","Ashford & Simpson aced this dvd!  Thank you Nick and Val for producing this keeper. I've been a fan since their Motown days when I met them, so I've had the priviledge of seeing them perform live over the years. This dvd was NOT a disappointment in any way because it showed their artistic versatility.In the middle of their dvd, they take the time to introduce us to the music which they wrote for a play, ""Invisible Life"", based on the author E. Lynn Harris's book. Val, Nick and Clayton who is a 'Sugar Bar' (their N.Y. Club) member, portray the actors by singing 4 of the songs which are: (1) This Is Where We Meet,(2) I Don't Ride This Train,(3) Born This Way, and (4) Invisible Life. Since, I enjoy plays, I found the tunes and lyrics to be very well written because the music was very explanatory of the play. In addition, Nick & Val did an extra superb job in rendering the songs, ""Still Such a Thing"" and ""Gimme Something Real"". To see them perform these songs together as their voices blended so well is totally awesome!!! And, of course, it goes without needing to say that the old stand by's listed on the dvd are great as well!I'm so glad we have this keeper to remember Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson's loveable performances by. The way Nick looked at Val as she performed was touching! Did anyone catch him jumping in supportive joy as she tore up the gospel song ""Changed"" at Oprah's 'Legends Ball' Sunday brunch? If not, go to youtube and check it out.The two personal one-on-one interviews, featured as a bonus on the dvd, with Nick and Val is truly a nice way to remember them by as a team. It was a nice touch.R.I.P. Nick. Your spirit lives on through your beautiful lyrics. May God bless Val and family and give them strength to carry on.",5,Thank You Nick & Val for the memories.
