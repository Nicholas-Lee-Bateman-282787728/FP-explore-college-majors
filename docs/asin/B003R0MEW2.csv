1359453,A1FDKI5RWBN1OR,B003R0MEW2,Author Simon Smith-Wilson,"[18, 20]","I wasn't sure how they would handle this season after the shooting last season. I thought the show might go in the wrong direction and it would be the start of the end. This season was amazing. I thought they handled the fallout of last seasons finale really well. I love the character stories that ran throughout the season. Yang seemed to take more of a centre stage this season, which was great as she is one of my favourite characters. There are one or two tiny new characters, but I think they are more for future seasons and were added to sort of get the ball rolling on next seasons stories. Meredith had a fantastic storyline this season, which sort of came alive towards the second half. Karev centred episodes were actually my favourite. Hopefully at some point something will actually go right for him! The characters continue to get better. There was not a dull episode in the season. The musical was really funny and I think we can establish who can sing and who can't by the way Callie basically sings nearly every song.

I thought this season would be the same, but I am happy  to say that Grey's has become a must-watch show for me again.I am writing this before the season ends, so my review may change depending upon how the rest of the season goes, but I've really enjoyed this season so far. They didn't introduce new characters this season, which I think helped, and instead spent the time focusing on the relationships and personal growth of the already established characters.

1359459,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003R0MEW2,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In 2005, ""Grey's Anatomy"" became a critically acclaimed television series that would become ABC's top rated dramas and winner of two Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.Created by Shonda Rhimes (""Private Practice""), the drama series revolves around a group of interns and their experience at Seattle Grace Hospital.

When it comes to television drama series, ""Grey's Anatomy"" is one of ABC's highly rated dramas that although filmed in a hospital setting. The cinematography for the final episode was excellent. For the most part, the series looks good on DVD, nice good closeups and skintones are natural and during low light scenes, I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts. For the most part, the seventh season does look very good on DVD.AUDIO:As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable, while the music has always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes. I did notice more surround usage in the final two episodes. From the sirens, gun shots, crowd ambiance being utilized through the surround channels.The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Seventh Season: More Heartbeats"" includes the following special features:DISC 5:Normal & Extended episode of ""Episode 144 - Song Beneath the Song"" -  This extended episode (48:01)  and the normal episode (44:01) are featured on disc 5.DISC 6:The Music Event: Behind the Scenes - (15:00) The making of the ""Song Beneath the Song"" musical episode and how the cast reacted when they heard they were doing a musical.  Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers talked about how they convinced the talent to do the musical episode, as many were opposed to doing it and how everything came together.Dissecting Grey's Anatomy: Unaired Scenes - Eleven deleted scenes.In Stitches: Outtakes  - (2:42) Season seven outtakes.Seattle Grace: Message of Hope Webisodes - A total of six webisodes (No Comment, Take One, The Face, Nerves, Award-Winning, The Sizzle) and ""The Making of Seattle Grace: Message of Hope"" (4:05).EXTRAS:""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Seventh Season: More Heartbeats"" comes with a slip case.JUDGMENT CALL:With the success of how the sixth season of ""Grey's Anatomy"" literally ending with a bang, it made you wonder how Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers and the writers for the series would continue the excitement.For the most part, the changes made in the sixth season was important.  The addition of newer characters, removal of one and building upon the momentum left from season six and sure enough, the writers had enough to work with.  From the post-traumatic stress that Cristina had suffered and the life changing decisions made by other characters.  That was important to showcase.Also, I liked how each character had character building storylines and no one was left out.  Even Callie and Arizona as well as Mark and their triangle begins to become focused on. Especially with the musical and seeing how their relationship is tested.But possibly the plus for this season are not about the lovemaking, not about the relationships, it's about the flaws of the characters.  Without getting into details, these situations are going to be quite interesting as it will carry on over to season eight.  Cristina having post-traumatic stress but also dealing with a situation that will definitely have a major affect on her and her relationship with Owen.  But also Meredith, who did something that is not so surprising, since she does have a good heart but unfortunately, she violated the trust of her husband and chief and unfortunately made an unethical decision as a doctor which unfortunately will hurt her career.Suffice to say, the last season was shocking and emotional, but this time around, it's an emotional season in a different sense, marked by decisions made by each individual and unfortunately will lead to consequences that will factor into the eighth season of ""Grey's Anatomy"".As for this DVD set, there are a good amount of special features including the web episodes of ""Seattle Grace: On Call"", deleted scenes and the making of the musical episode.With that being said, while the sixth season was a tremendous season with a shocking finale, the seventh season was more of a recovering episode from what took place in season six and the talent did a fantastic job in showing their way of recovering from what took place.  The return of Mandy Moore as Mary Portman was touching but also an unexpected conclusion to her storyline and the various storylines that were setup that will have repercussions, we're going to have to wait and see how these characters are affected in season eight.But the situations are realistic and without spoiling the series, fans of the series who didn't have a chance to watch the seventh season should be content.  These are well-written episodes, the acting was well-done and while people may feel a bit 50/50 on the inclusion of the musical, it does come to show that Shonda Rhimes is willing to take chances.If you are a fan of the series, ""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Seventh Season: More Heartbeats"" is definitely recommended!",4,"An enjoyable yet emotional seventh season of ""Grey's

However, the writers are beginning to stretch things the way soap opera writers do. Christina and Owen never seem to resolve. They just agonize and agonize and it begins to become tedious. The Chief's wife's Alzheimers becomes grotesque and it gets rubbed in his and our faces. Kepner's hysteria becomes infuriating - you just want to kick her in the teeth. And, Lexy is set up for a terrible death, and even though she's almost as annoying as Kepner, you just somehow feel she's being subjected to prolonged sadism. However, many episodes are medically brilliant and they alone make the season worth watching. Also, Alex Karev gets some redemption, which is a a relief.

I could have done without Meredith's singing because it's so out of character for her, and personally I think it would have been better if only Callie, Lexie, Owen, and Bailey sang.  Obviously the show was trying to showcase Sara Ramirez's singing after her first album came out,and I don't fault them for that.The story beneath the songs is very powerful, so even if you don't like the singing, look beneath it a little bit, and you'll see what I mean.This episode made me think about Chicago Hope's musical episode, which was hilarious!!!
