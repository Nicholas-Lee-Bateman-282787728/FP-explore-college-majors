949425,A2XZE1TB784HKX,B000BT98XK,"alex fryling ""youngfry""","[0, 0]",This by far is one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen in my life. That may seem like an over statement to most because they might have not heard of the movie but it is a must pick up. It has Samuel L Jackson and it features him on a goose chase to catch criminals. He meets up with a guy referred to as the man in this movie and he is there to make a presentation about teeth but he gets pulled into the chase as well. Funny differences between the man and Samuel L Jackson as he is the white nerdy man and Jackson is the serious officer. They start out not liking each other but then become friends near the end of the movie. A great amount of comedy and action that makes the movie mix very well. I know you won't have heard of this it was made a few years ago and wasn't a huge project but if you ask for it at FYE or best buy they should have it and for a good price. The movie runs well at an hour and a half but could have been a little longer. Overall great movie and 5 stars if you ask me.,5,The Man Is a Must See Comedy and a 5 Star DVD,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,1004,"['far', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'may', 'seem', 'statement', 'most', 'might', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'movie', 'must', 'pick', 'up', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'goose', 'chase', 'catch', 'criminals', 'up', 'guy', 'referred', 'man', 'movie', 'there', 'make', 'presentation', 'teeth', 'pulled', 'chase', 'as', 'well', 'Funny', 'differences', 'man', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'white', 'nerdy', 'man', 'Jackson', 'serious', 'officer', 'start', 'out', 'not', 'liking', 'other', 'then', 'become', 'friends', 'end', 'movie', 'great', 'amount', 'comedy', 'action', 'movie', 'mix', 'very', 'well', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'heard', 'was', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'project', 'ask', 'FYE', 'best', 'buy', 'should', 'have', 'good', 'price', 'movie', 'well', 'hour', 'half', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'longer', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'ask']",The Man

When ATF agent Derrick Vann (Jackson, Pulp Fiction) learns that his partner is dead and a cache of guns has been stolen, he sets up a sting to get the weapons back. But into the middle of his scheme stumbles Andy Fiddler (Levy, A Mighty Wind, American Pie), a dental supplies salesman from Wisconsin. From there unspools some formulaic buddy-movie pap: Vann gives Fiddler a dose of excitement and Fiddler teaches Vann a little compassion and trust as they improbably track down the bad guys. To a degree, the producers were right--the interplay between Levy's Groucho eyebrows and Jackson's burning scowl provides the only juice this movie has.

If you are a fan of movies like ""Midnight Run"" and ""Stakeout"" you will probably enjoy it. Samuel Jackson is great in a dramatic role as an ATF officer trying to track down the gunrunners that killed his partner and are selling the large shipment of guns they stole. Eugene Levy is pretty comical as the wrong man in the right place at the wrong time. He adds the comedic element to the movie as a dentist going to a convention in Detroit.

949433,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000BT98XK,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[3, 4]","This year has been a bizarre year for movies. It literally has some of the best and worst things I've seen in a while. The year started off rocky, but things really picked up during the summer. While there may be fewer five-star movies out there, this summer was a great time to see some really good films.However, once Labor Day passes, we pass into the doldrums of the fall. Kids are back in school, so there are fewer of them at the multiplex. The big summer blockbusters have all been released, and the holiday films are still several months away. Same goes for the Oscar nods that tend to flood the market in the winter.Some say that late August and early September are the darkest days for movies, and that's usually true. It certainly was for the last few weeks with movies like ""A Sound of Thunder"" and ""The Cave"" stinking up the joint. I had little confidence that ""The Man,"" a fish-out-of-water buddy cop movie starring Eugene Levy and Samuel L. Jackson, was going to be different.In fact, I said to a friend before seeing it, ""This has `suck' written all over it.""However, as I was watching the movie, something strange happened... I started laughing. Does this mean that ""The Man"" is a great movie? No. It doesn't even mean it was a good movie. It just made me laugh.The movie itself is beyond preposterous. Eugene Levy plays a dental equipment salesman who stumbles into an arms deal orchestrated by an ATF officer played by Samuel L. Jackson. They're stuck together as a bickering couple until they can bring down the bad guys. The stars play exactly to type. Eugene Levy reprises the roles he played in films like ""American Pie"" and ""Waiting for Guffman."" Samuel L. Jackson gives us the honest cop take on his character Jules from ""Pulp Fiction.""But they're both so good at these stock characters that it brings a bizarre level of charm to the movie. It's what ""Pulp Fiction"" would have been if Eugene Levy had been cast as Vincent Vega instead of John Travolta. Not really a good idea, but still funny.Is it predictable? Yes. Does it have juvenile humor throughout it? Yes. Is the story as flimsy as wet tissue paper? Absolutely. It is everything that all the other critics are going to complain about. But like the gorgeous Jessica Rabbit once told a cynical private investigator as to why she loved her freaky little husband. He made her laugh. Never underestimate the power of laughter, people. It's what made the fat, bald Curly Howard a huge ladies man.Ultimately, you can't take this movie too seriously. In some ways, this film is as much of a spoof of the buddy-cop formula as it is a serious attempt to make another ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Rush Hour."" I wouldn't expect Levy and Jackson to become cinema icons like the famous comedy duos Laurel & Hardy or Abbot & Costello. They're more like the less-famous comedy duo of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.They do put on a good show... as long as you're not expecting something great.",4,The Man (DVD),1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,2950,"['year', 'been', 'bizarre', 'year', 'movies', 'literally', 'best', 'worst', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'year', 'started', 'rocky', 'things', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'summer', 'may', 'be', 'fewer', 'five-star', 'movies', 'there', 'summer', 'was', 'great', 'time', 'see', 'really', 'good', 'films.However', 'once', 'Labor', 'Day', 'pass', 'doldrums', 'fall', 'Kids', 'are', 'back', 'school', 'are', 'fewer', 'multiplex', 'big', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'holiday', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'several', 'months', 'away', 'Same', 'Oscar', 'nods', 'tend', 'flood', 'market', 'winter.Some', 'say', 'late', 'August', 'early', 'September', 'are', 'darkest', 'days', 'movies', 'usually', 'true', 'certainly', 'was', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'movies', 'A', 'Sound', 'Thunder', 'Cave', 'stinking', 'up', 'joint', 'had', 'little', 'confidence', 'Man', 'fish-out-of-water', 'buddy', 'cop', 'movie', 'starring', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'different.In', 'fact', 'said', 'friend', 'seeing', 'suck', 'written', 'However', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'something', 'strange', 'happened', 'started', 'laughing', 'mean', 'Man', 'great', 'movie', 'No', ""n't"", 'even', 'mean', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'made', 'laugh.The', 'movie', 'preposterous', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'dental', 'equipment', 'salesman', 'who', 'arms', 'deal', 'orchestrated', 'ATF', 'officer', 'played', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'together', 'bickering', 'couple', 'can', 'bring', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'stars', 'play', 'exactly', 'type', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'roles', 'played', 'films', 'American', 'Pie', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'honest', 'cop', 'take', 'character', 'Jules', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', ""'re"", 'so', 'good', 'stock', 'characters', 'bizarre', 'level', 'charm', 'movie', 'what', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'Vincent', 'Vega', 'instead', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Not', 'really', 'good', 'idea', 'still', 'funny.Is', 'predictable', 'Yes', 'have', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'Yes', 'story', 'as', 'flimsy', 'wet', 'tissue', 'paper', 'Absolutely', 'everything', 'other', 'critics', 'are', 'going', 'complain', 'gorgeous', 'Jessica', 'Rabbit', 'once', 'told', 'cynical', 'private', 'investigator', 'why', 'loved', 'freaky', 'little', 'husband', 'made', 'laugh', 'Never', 'underestimate', 'power', 'laughter', 'people', 'what', 'made', 'fat', 'bald', 'Curly', 'Howard', 'huge', 'ladies', 'man.Ultimately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'movie', 'too', 'seriously', 'ways', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'spoof', 'buddy-cop', 'formula', 'serious', 'attempt', 'make', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Levy', 'Jackson', 'become', 'cinema', 'icons', 'famous', 'comedy', 'duos', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Abbot', 'Costello', ""'re"", 'more', 'less-famous', 'comedy', 'duo', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'Jackie', 'Chan.They', 'do', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'something', 'great']",The Man

They're both great at what they do, and could have been great in this movie if only the script hadn't gotten in the way.  Unfortunately, while ""The Man"" does have funny moments, there just aren't enough of them -- and they aren't nearly funny enough -- to make this a real keeper.  As happens way too often these days, in fact, if you've seen the preview, you've seen 99% of the funny stuff.On top of that, EVERYTHING else about the movie is stale formulae.  There are no twists or turns you won't expect, the Internal Affairs cop is exactly the same as every IA cop you've ever seen -- which is a huge waste of Miguel Ferrer's talents -- and the ""case"" they work on is phony at every level.That brings us to the core problem with ""The Man"": There's not enough of a real, new story for it to be an action film with funny partners, like ""Lethal Weapon,"" and it's not funny enough to throw all logic out the window and just laugh at the nonsense, like ""Airplane"" or ""Bowfinger.""  (It's also not original enough to overcome such categories.)  And one would think that the DVD itself might save the day by providing a bunch of side-splitting outtakes or something, but no luck there, either...just the same mediocrity in alternate formats.So...yes, I do suggest you see it.  Your video store will have several copies available.  But buy it?  Only the most hard core Samuel L. Jackson or Eugene Levy fan would do that.

He eventually figures out that the deal went down already, only with Andy instead of himself.So he takes Andy along with him to try and continue the deal and make things right.

However, this movie was just not that funny. There were about three times that I laughed really hard, but the rest of the movie, I was just watching Eugene get in and out of one scrape after another. The characters are stock characters for Eugene and Samuel. Eugene is playing the straight-laced, good hearted though somewhat naive, dental supply salesman and Samuel plays a hard-nosed cop who doesn't trust anybody. I felt like I had seen both of them play these characters in other movies and while they are both very good at these roles, the movie did not come off as being fresh or original because you feel like you've seen this before. You just haven't seen these two do it TOGETHER (which I think is the whole point of this movie).Of the two, I enjoyed Levy's performance more than Samuel's, possibly because Levy's character is the butt of most of the jokes. Plus I miss the snappy dialogue of Samuel's other movies like the Long Kiss Goodnight or the interesting meanderings of Pulp Fiction. Though the theme is a re-hashed one, I appreciated the fact that the two men had to learn from one another. The dental salesman needed to learn discernment and the cop needed to learn trust.I think that the acting was good but because the material that Levy and Jackson had to work with was not fresh, The Man suffered because of it. Still, it's a light hearted buddy movie and deserves a look. However, I definately would not pay 19.95 (ie, full price) for this movie! Buy it on sale unless you are a collector of works by these actors or this director and you just have to have it! The only exception would be if you've never seen other films by Levy or Jackson.
