675497,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005QKAZ,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","On more than one occasion back in the day (and strangely more recently as well) I have had to do battle with the idea that back in the 1960s, back in the time of the now greying ( I am being kind), AARP-worthy generation of &#8217;68 music was the revolution. By that those who defended that position meant that if we could wire enough of the youth (after all it was mainly youth who were spouting the concept-the parents, mostly rightly, were the &#8220;enemy&#8221;) into Woodstock/Isle of Wright/Monterrey/ music festivals and communes the society would be transformed from within without the messy necessary of taking on the power structure. A structure that just then was gearing up for blowback. Well forty plus years of cultural wars have put paid to the notion that we could have won that way, or any way short of a serious frontal assault on the old order. Now I do not know if the subject of this review, the folk rock troubadour Donovan, in the documentary of his musical life Sunshine Superman; The Journey of Donovan subscribed to that idea (some statements in the film made by him would lead me to believe that he at least partially believed that) but he certainly was a lightning rod for the countercultural musical currents of the time.During this three hour film journey of his life Donovan, still performing in the 2000s the time of this film&#8217;s creation, carefully explains his take on the music and people, not all well-known, who influenced him starting out and along the way, how he crafted his various iconic songs of the time (the Sunshine Superman of the title, Mellow Yellow, Atlantis, Season of the Witch and so on), and his take on the rise and fall of the countercultural movement of the 1960s. (By the way the three hours went by very quickly so don&#8217;t use that as a bar to enjoyment on this one). Interestingly enough, although he grew up in Scotland during the 1950s, many of his formative experiences mirror the same trail of self-discovery that many of us in America travelled on the road to our generation&#8217;s hallmark jail break-out from the red scare Cold War night that had descended on us and that we insipidly were rebelling against then.Of course for some of us (like Donovan and this writer) on the front-end edge of the post- World War II baby boomer explosion we got caught up in the back end of the serious &#8220;beat&#8221; generation thing that got its impetus from Jack Kerouac&#8217;s On The Road and Allen Ginsberg&#8217;s poetic Howl. Those sources gave their imprimatur to our jail-break impulses and one could almost count on kindred having read (and re-read) those sources as their &#8220;bible&#8221; on the road to the 1960sas well. Naturally the Dylan-Baez-Seeger&#8211;led folk minute with its folk festivals, coffeehouses and iterant troubadours (as Donovan described himself) was a huge influence. (Donovan also gives his take on the folk minute controversy over who was king of the hill-him or Dylan).Those influences are the antecedents of Donovan&#8217;s real fame and work more popularly associated with the mid-1960s at first the move to melt folk with rock and then the decisive drug-influenced &#8220;acid rock&#8221; rage where the theme took over &#8220;drug, sex and rock and roll&#8221;- and we liked all three just fine. That is the period of Mellow Yellow, Sunshine Superman and other mystical and experimental songs. Of course, maybe we knew it, maybe not, but that whole cultural movement could not sustain itself, began to turn on itself and Donovan had to take stock of his life like we all did. The nice part of the film is that the &#8220;talking head&#8221; older and wiser Donovan take on things is interspersed with plenty of interesting film footage from back in the time of his time. Were we really that young and innocent? This one is for 1960s nostalgia buffs, countercultural history aficionados and those, young and old but mostly young, who missed it to know what it was like when a significant part of a generation tried to turn the world upside down.",4,In The Time Of Mellow Yellow,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,4056,"['more', 'one', 'occasion', 'back', 'day', 'strangely', 'more', 'recently', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'had', 'do', 'battle', 'idea', 'back', '1960s', 'back', 'time', 'now', 'greying', 'am', 'being', 'kind', 'AARP-worthy', 'generation', '8217', '68', 'music', 'was', 'revolution', 'who', 'defended', 'position', 'meant', 'could', 'wire', 'enough', 'youth', 'was', 'mainly', 'youth', 'who', 'were', 'spouting', 'concept-the', 'parents', 'mostly', 'rightly', 'were', '8220', '8221', 'Woodstock/Isle', 'Wright/Monterrey/', 'music', 'festivals', 'society', 'would', 'be', 'transformed', 'messy', 'necessary', 'taking', 'power', 'structure', 'structure', 'just', 'then', 'was', 'gearing', 'up', 'blowback', 'Well', 'forty', 'years', 'cultural', 'wars', 'have', 'put', 'paid', 'notion', 'could', 'have', 'won', 'way', 'way', 'short', 'serious', 'frontal', 'assault', 'old', 'order', 'Now', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'subject', 'review', 'folk', 'rock', 'troubadour', 'Donovan', 'documentary', 'musical', 'life', 'Sunshine', 'Superman', 'Journey', 'Donovan', 'subscribed', 'idea', 'statements', 'film', 'made', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'least', 'partially', 'believed', 'certainly', 'was', 'lightning', 'rod', 'countercultural', 'musical', 'currents', 'time.During', 'three', 'hour', 'film', 'journey', 'life', 'Donovan', 'still', 'performing', '2000s', 'time', 'film', '8217', 'creation', 'carefully', 'take', 'music', 'people', 'not', 'well-known', 'who', 'influenced', 'starting', 'out', 'way', 'how', 'crafted', 'various', 'iconic', 'songs', 'time', 'Sunshine', 'Superman', 'title', 'Mellow', 'Yellow', 'Atlantis', 'Season', 'Witch', 'so', 'take', 'rise', 'fall', 'countercultural', 'movement', '1960s', 'way', 'three', 'hours', 'went', 'very', 'quickly', 'don', '8217', 'use', 'bar', 'enjoyment', 'one', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'grew', 'up', 'Scotland', '1950s', 'many', 'formative', 'experiences', 'mirror', 'same', 'trail', 'self-discovery', 'many', 'America', 'travelled', 'road', 'generation', '8217', 'hallmark', 'jail', 'break-out', 'red', 'scare', 'Cold', 'War', 'night', 'had', 'descended', 'insipidly', 'were', 'rebelling', 'then.Of', 'course', 'Donovan', 'writer', 'front-end', 'edge', 'post-', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'baby', 'boomer', 'explosion', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'back', 'end', 'serious', '8220', '8221', 'generation', 'thing', 'got', 'impetus', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', '8217', 's', 'Road', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', '8217', 'poetic', 'Howl', 'sources', 'gave', 'imprimatur', 'jail-break', 'impulses', 'one', 'could', 'almost', 'count', 'kindred', 'having', 'read', 're-read', 'sources', '8220', 'bible', '8221', 'road', '1960sas', 'well', 'Naturally', 'Dylan-Baez-Seeger', '8211', 'led', 'folk', 'minute', 'folk', 'festivals', 'coffeehouses', 'iterant', 'troubadours', 'Donovan', 'described', 'was', 'huge', 'influence', 'Donovan', 'also', 'take', 'folk', 'minute', 'controversy', 'who', 'was', 'king', 'hill-him', 'Dylan', '.Those', 'influences', 'are', 'antecedents', 'Donovan', '8217', 'real', 'fame', 'work', 'more', 'popularly', 'associated', 'mid-1960s', 'first', 'move', 'melt', 'folk', 'rock', 'then', 'decisive', 'drug-influenced', '8220', 'rock', '8221', 'rage', 'where', 'theme', 'took', 'over', '8220', 'drug', 'sex', 'rock', 'roll', '8221', 'liked', 'three', 'just', 'fine', 'period', 'Mellow', 'Yellow', 'Sunshine', 'Superman', 'other', 'mystical', 'experimental', 'songs', 'course', 'maybe', 'knew', 'maybe', 'not', 'whole', 'cultural', 'movement', 'could', 'not', 'sustain', 'began', 'turn', 'Donovan', 'had', 'take', 'stock', 'life', 'did', 'nice', 'part', 'film', '8220', 'talking', 'head', '8221', 'older', 'wiser', 'Donovan', 'take', 'things', 'interspersed', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'film', 'footage', 'back', 'time', 'time', 'Were', 'really', 'young', 'innocent', 'one', '1960s', 'nostalgia', 'buffs', 'countercultural', 'history', 'aficionados', 'young', 'old', 'mostly', 'young', 'who', 'missed', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'significant', 'part', 'generation', 'tried', 'turn', 'world', 'upside', 'down']",N/A

675502,A2EPPBGMEMW6SQ,B00005QKAZ,C. Bermant,"[2, 4]","So I'm about half way through this, and most of my reactions are echoed by those who have already written here. For years I have gone to concerts by Dylan, Neil Young, etc., hoping they would say something interesting in between the songs, or anything at all. Then I saw Lindsey Buckingham a few years ago and he went on and on.....This movie reminds me of that. Except with Lindsey there was hope for a song, somewhere.What jumps out is Donovan's Dylan Denials---directly refuted by the music and posture shown in film. Why not just admit it? Until he found his own way he was a direct rip off. So were a lot of other people. Back then, people who loved Dylan and the Beatles wore their albums out many times over, and then went looking for more of the same. The idea was to be new, interesting and creative while drawing on enough of the familiar. Additionally, most of the good songs hadn't been written, so it only took a little bit of imagination to do something cool.Donovan could have said something like ""we all stole from each other, we all stole from Dylan and I stole more than anyone else. So what?""History is always being rewritten by people with cameras. So you will need to make up your mind about a lot of this. Not just music, everything else.",3,He did steal from Dylan.

If you are remotely interested what this set has to offer than rent it. If you want a nice and lengthy look into the career of Donovan than this is for you.This is a 2 DVD set, the first disc is a 3 hour documentary on the life of 60's folk musician Donovan. It is an interview with the man himself in which he takes you on his ""journey"" through his life and history as a musician via vinatge performance clips and private films. Other interviews include his wife Linda, his arranger James Cameron, luthier Danny Ferrington and not much else. Unfortunately, some friends of Donovan are no longer with us such as Mickey Most, George Harrison, Keith Moon, Brian Jones, and Gram Parsons. Other contemporaries from the era are conspicuous from the absence, which is a shame; it would have been nice to have Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Danny Thompson, Shawn Philips or John Paul Jones talk about their involvement with Donovan. But then again maybe the blame should be laid at the director's feet. I would think in better hands the story would have been more varied with many different points of view if more of Donovan's contemporaries were interviewed. However, that does not mean it is a bad documentary either. Donovan tells his story like the story teller he is.People have criticized about how Donovan's pontifical nature is off putting. To me he comes off like a teacher showing those who are interested in him how and what moved him artistically and musically. I have never walked away from any musical documentary and not think the subject had a big ego. You have to have a big ego and a sense of arrogance about yourself in the arts so I was not surprised about some of his posturing.The second disc contains 2 hours of live performances, the ""Wear Your Love Like Heaven"" promo film, extended interviews and performances of songs as well as trip into Donovan's archives. While not as elaborate as a certain Canadian with an even bigger ego as Donovan's, it is kind of fun.If you are a fan of Donovan and music documentaries than this is for you, at 5 hours you are getting your money's worth along with a booklet of liner notes and photos. Be forewarned Donovan is the main man here; you are not going to get any interviews with other musicians from the era which rather narrows the scope of the story. However, that is not really up to me now is it?Oh by the way, all you people who say that Donovan stole from Bob Dylan well Dylan stole from Woody Guthrie, so there.",4,A Video Auto-biography,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2570,"['am', 'going', 'say', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Donovan', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'set', 'are', 'remotely', 'interested', 'what', 'set', 'offer', 'rent', 'want', 'nice', 'lengthy', 'look', 'career', 'Donovan', 'you.This', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'disc', '3', 'hour', 'documentary', 'life', '60', 'folk', 'musician', 'Donovan', 'interview', 'man', 'journey', 'life', 'history', 'musician', 'vinatge', 'performance', 'clips', 'private', 'films', 'Other', 'interviews', 'include', 'wife', 'Linda', 'arranger', 'James', 'Cameron', 'luthier', 'Danny', 'Ferrington', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Unfortunately', 'friends', 'Donovan', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'such', 'Mickey', 'Most', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'Gram', 'Parsons', 'Other', 'contemporaries', 'era', 'are', 'conspicuous', 'absence', 'shame', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'Danny', 'Thompson', 'Shawn', 'Philips', 'John', 'Paul', 'Jones', 'talk', 'involvement', 'Donovan', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'blame', 'should', 'be', 'laid', 'director', 'feet', 'would', 'think', 'better', 'hands', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'varied', 'many', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'more', 'Donovan', 'contemporaries', 'were', 'interviewed', 'However', 'not', 'mean', 'bad', 'documentary', 'Donovan', 'story', 'story', 'teller', 'have', 'criticized', 'how', 'Donovan', 'pontifical', 'nature', 'putting', 'teacher', 'showing', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'how', 'what', 'moved', 'artistically', 'musically', 'have', 'never', 'walked', 'away', 'musical', 'documentary', 'not', 'think', 'subject', 'had', 'big', 'ego', 'have', 'have', 'big', 'ego', 'sense', 'arrogance', 'arts', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'posturing.The', 'second', 'disc', '2', 'hours', 'live', 'performances', 'Wear', 'Love', 'Heaven', 'promo', 'film', 'extended', 'interviews', 'performances', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'trip', 'Donovan', 'archives', 'not', 'as', 'elaborate', 'certain', 'Canadian', 'even', 'bigger', 'ego', 'Donovan', 'kind', 'fun.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Donovan', 'music', 'documentaries', '5', 'hours', 'are', 'getting', 'money', 'worth', 'along', 'booklet', 'liner', 'notes', 'photos', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'Donovan', 'main', 'man', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'interviews', 'other', 'musicians', 'era', 'rather', 'scope', 'story', 'However', 'not', 'really', 'now', 'Oh', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'Donovan', 'stole', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'well', 'Dylan', 'stole', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'so', 'there']",N/A

Well, actually, about 2 hours and 20 minutes in, you hear Donovan's wife tell you more than even a Bonaroo security staff guy would want to know about astrology and ""becoming one with the rock you're sitting on"", but it is a nice breather from the ever present voice of, dare I say...Donovan.Now you are probably wondering to yourself, between angry, indignant breaths, why someone who is evidently not a fan of Donovan, would be watching this in the first place. Well, granting you the point that I am not a Donovan fan, my response is that it has nothing to do with how awful this psuedo-documentary is. I am a musician, and a documentary fan. I watch and read scores of rock bios by all kinds of artists regardless of whether-or-not I like their music, simply because you don't have to be a fan of a bands music in order to enjoy a good story. The recent Peter Bogdonovich film about Tom Petty was one of the most interesting and rewarding 3 1/2 hours I ever spent in front of the boob tube, and I don't like Tom Petty's music either. But I did find, after a watching a well-made and down-to earth film, that I liked Tom Petty, and enjoyed hearing the story of how his band got together, fermented their influences into a style, lived with each other, made their albums, etc.There is virtually none of this in Sunshine Superman. It is really an extended vanity piece in which Donovan waxes rhapsodically about everything under the sun, without the slightest hint of humor or self-depreciation..for three, solid hours. Now I understand that all entertainers, to a point, do what they do, because they think they can do something you will want to see, or hear. A small degree of self-involvement is practically a requirement. But in the history of documentaries I never seen an ego trip quite as egregious as this thing.Part of the problem may not be The big D's fault however. Someone, possibly the director, had the bright idea of having Donovan host what is essentially his own tribute. It is much easier, not to mention much less irritating, to have various talking heads, critics, and musicians sing your praises for you. But when you are not only the story, but the story teller, everything takes on the almost wince-inducing feel of self flattery. And Donovan's utter lack of humor about himself only adds to the uneasy format. Something tells me that the only reaction you would get from telling Donovan a good, dirty joke would be a vacant stare, not entirely unlike that of a goat staring at a particularly complicated insurance form.In three hours I learned suprisingly little about Donovan's recording process, or how his albums were made, or what other people thought of them, or which ones sold better than others, or about almost anyone in his vicinity. But I did learn an awful lot about cosmic conciousness, that he knew lots of famous people and that they admired him, that Sunshine Superman (the LP) was a masterpiece and that he didn't copy Bob Dylan.Toward the end of this endurance test, there is footage of him playing on a rock by The Joshua Tree and going into great detail about it's spiritual significance while his wife talks very earnestly about mushrooms and Tarot Card reading. If there was ever a candidate for the hippie Spinal Tap, this is basically it. If you are a very earnest hippie, I assume this will not in any way dissuade you from buying this, and you may even find three hours of this inane drivel interesting, but even then, you still won't learn anything about Donovan that he didn't want you to know. Now even for the most ardent flower child...where's the fun in that?",1,"Well, it certainly provides maximum Donovan..",1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,5221,"['Ok', 'conditional', 'rating.If', 'are',

This is probably one of the best documentaries on a pop star that I've ever seen.  It is so thoughtfully and beautifully put together that is difficult with which to find fault.  The presentation is as easy going and insightful as Donovan's music.  If I have a complaint, it would be that few of the songs are presented in their entirety.  It would have been grand to have been given at least one complete video of each of his songs, but that isn't how Sunshine Superman plays out, and I'm okay with that.  As it is, it is a remarkable treat, and I am thoroughly satisfied with having had an opportunity to see the entire three hour production.  Simply wonderful.
