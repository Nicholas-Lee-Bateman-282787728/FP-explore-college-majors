1527760,AB34G6VKP28L,B0077PBPVE,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[58, 68]","It was the novel Charles Dickens never finished. Halfway into the narrative, he suffered from a stroke and died the following day, leaving his mystery unfinished. No one knows how he intended it to end, but after a viewing of this recent adaptation by the BBC I must admit, it has a certain Dickens-esque style.There is only one woman for John Jasper (Matthew Rhys). Unfortunately, she happens to be introduced to his younger nephew, Edwin Drood (Freddie Fox). An ambitious young man who dreams of foreign travels with a cherub face but has too little respect for his fianc&eacute; to please his uncle, he cannot seem to understand how blessed he is to be engaged to such a lovely girl. But Jasper is profoundly aware of it, so much so that his opium-induced fantasies in a darkened corner of a local den often include dispatching with his blonde nephew and taking his place in Rosa's arms. His attention is unnoticed by most but not by Rosa (Tamzin Merchant), who is uncomfortable with his affection and seeks to avoid him whenever possible. Having remained silent on the matter, she confides her concern to her new friend, Helena Landless (Amber Rose Revah), a recent arrival to the school from India.Unfortunately, that very evening Helena's hot-tempered brother Neville (Sacha Dhawan) and Edwin come to a dispute in Jasper's rooms over the young man's treatment of Rosa in public, which leads to an estrangement that threatens to grow into something more as Jasper's obsession with the young woman deepens. His obsession with the crypt beneath the church also causes suspicion when Durdles (Ron Cook) is hired to carve a new monument for one of the graves, and the child commonly about the church and grounds has an encounter with the older man that leaves him shaken. But none of them are prepared for what is to come... and some of them may not emerge from it unscathed.Writing an ending for a famous unfinished novel is no easy task, but I was impressed with this adaptation that takes a different twist than former versions I have seen. The writer consulted as much information as she could find about Dickens' intended ending and crafted a story that easily fits into his usual style, with frequent twists and turns in the final hour that bring all to light. Although this two hour film feels too short and ends rather abruptly (it is a conclusion that made me smile but long for more), it's also very cleverly written and full of the same wonderful characters Dickens is so known for, ranging from shut-in bookkeepers longing for fresh air to the ornery little boy who is always about chucking stones at people. It has occasional moments of sheer wit and hilarity, such as when the child complains that the singing of the choir could put a ""good man off his lunch,"" but also some downright creepy material.The best thing about it, however, in my opinion is the casting - Matthew Rhys is a brilliant John Jasper. He has the charisma to draw the audience to him and make them fond of him, even sorry for him, while at the same time hinting at a darker temper that keeps us continually on edge. Whether brooding in a corner or ""devouring Rosa with his eyes,"" he mesmerizes us in a way that few actors accomplish. Some have complained that the second half is convoluted and absurd, with plot holes and melodramatic scenes, but I disagree... I think it is brilliant. I loved it and its darker nuances, as well as how neatly everything ties together based on small but significant clues in the first hour. That said, I would have liked another hour in which to further pursue some of the secondary characters and plot lines!Maybe this isn't the ending Dickens envisioned when he created the unusual story of obsession and revenge but it is an entertaining and deeply thought-provoking way to spend an evening.",5,An ending Dickens would have liked,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,3813,"['was', 'novel', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'never', 'finished', 'Halfway', 'narrative', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'died', 'following', 'day', 'leaving', 'mystery', 'unfinished', 'one', 'how', 'intended', 'end', 'viewing', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'BBC', 'must', 'admit', 'certain', 'Dickens-esque', 'style.There', 'only', 'one', 'woman', 'John', 'Jasper', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'introduced', 'younger', 'nephew', 'Edwin', 'Drood', 'Freddie', 'Fox', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'foreign', 'travels', 'cherub', 'face', 'too', 'little', 'respect', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'please', 'uncle', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'understand', 'how', 'blessed', 'be', 'engaged', 'such', 'lovely', 'girl', 'Jasper', 'profoundly', 'aware', 'so', 'much', 'opium-induced', 'fantasies', 'darkened', 'corner', 'local', 'den', 'often', 'include', 'dispatching', 'blonde', 'nephew', 'taking', 'place', 'Rosa', 'arms', 'attention', 'unnoticed', 'most', 'not', 'Rosa', 'Tamzin', 'Merchant', 'who', 'uncomfortable', 'affection', 'avoid', 'whenever', 'possible', 'Having', 'remained', 'silent', 'matter', 'concern', 'new', 'friend', 'Helena', 'Landless', 'Amber', 'Rose', 'Revah', 'recent', 'arrival', 'school', 'India.Unfortunately', 'very', 'evening', 'Helena', 'hot-tempered', 'brother', 'Neville', 'Sacha', 'Dhawan', 'Edwin', 'come', 'dispute', 'Jasper', 'rooms', 'young', 'man', 'treatment', 'Rosa', 'public', 'estrangement', 'grow', 'something', 'more', 'Jasper', 'obsession', 'young', 'woman', 'obsession', 'crypt', 'church', 'also', 'suspicion', 'when', 'Durdles', 'Ron', 'Cook', 'hired', 'carve', 'new', 'monument', 'one', 'graves', 'child', 'commonly', 'church', 'grounds', 'encounter', 'older', 'man', 'shaken', 'none', 'are', 'prepared', 'what', 'come', 'may', 'not', 'emerge', 'unscathed.Writing', 'ending', 'famous', 'unfinished', 'novel', 'easy', 'task', 'was', 'impressed', 'adaptation', 'different', 'twist', 'former', 'versions', 'have', 'seen', 'writer', 'consulted', 'much', 'information', 'could', 'find', 'Dickens', 'intended', 'ending', 'crafted', 'story', 'easily', 'usual', 'style', 'frequent', 'twists', 'turns', 'final', 'hour', 'bring', 'light', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'feels', 'too', 'short', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'conclusion', 'made', 'smile', 'long', 'more', 'also', 'very', 'cleverly', 'written', 'full', 'same', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'Dickens', 'so', 'known', 'ranging', 'shut-in', 'bookkeepers', 'longing', 'fresh', 'air', 'ornery', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'always', 'chucking', 'stones', 'people', 'occasional', 'moments', 'sheer', 'wit', 'hilarity', 'such', 'when', 'child', 'singing', 'choir', 'could', 'put', 'good', 'man', 'lunch', 'also', 'downright', 'creepy', 'material.The', 'best', 'thing', 'however', 'opinion', 'casting', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'brilliant', 'John', 'Jasper', 'charisma', 'draw', 'audience', 'make', 'fond', 'even', 'sorry', 'same', 'time', 'hinting', 'darker', 'temper', 'continually', 'edge', 'Whether', 'brooding', 'corner', 'devouring', 'Rosa', 'eyes', 'way', 'few', 'actors', 'accomplish', 'have', 'complained', 'second', 'half', 'convoluted', 'absurd', 'plot', 'holes', 'melodramatic', 'scenes', 'disagree', 'think', 'brilliant', 'loved', 'darker', 'nuances', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'neatly', 'everything', 'ties', 'together', 'based', 'small', 'significant', 'clues', 'first', 'hour', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hour', 'further', 'pursue', 'secondary', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'ending', 'Dickens', 'envisioned', 'when', 'created', 'unusual', 'story', 'obsession', 'revenge', 'entertaining', 'deeply', 'thought-provoking', 'way', 'spend', 'evening']",Masterpiece Classic: The Mystery of Edwin Drood

1527764,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0077PBPVE,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","When Charles Dickens died in 1870, he left behind a half-finished novel called &#34;The Mystery of Edwin Drood.&#34; It was published as-is with no conclusion, since publishers hadn't yet started hiring people to finish such books.So there's a slight obstacle in adapting that half-finished book -- how do you adapt a story whose entire final act is missing, including the revelation of who committed the droodful crime? Well, you make up an ending. And while the big splashy climax of &#34;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&#34; relies too heavily on convenient timing, the story overall is an enjoyable mixture of darkness and light, with solid acting all around.It's made pretty obvious what's going to happen at the beginning, when choirmaster John Jasper (Matthew Rhys) has an opium-fueled dream about murdering his nephew Edwin Drood (Freddie Fox).  Edwin has just arrived in town to see his fiancee Rosa Bud (Tamzin Merchant), who doesn't seem particularly eager to marry him.At the same time, the kindly Reverend Crisparkle (Rory Kinnear) welcomes half-English twins Neville (Sacha Dhawan) and Helena Landless (Amber Rose Revah) as his houseguests. Neville immediately clashes with Edwin, whom he sees as spoiled and unworthy of Rosa. And as Rosa and Edwin's engagement goes through its final turbulence, John doses himself with opium and strangles his nephew, because he's madly in love with Rosa. Yes, this seems like a big spoiler, but we're never left in any doubt that it was him, and it's so heavily foreshadowed right from the first scene that it comes as no surprise.Of course, Neville is immediately suspected since he got into two fistfights in one evening with Edwin -- but he rebuts with a shocking revelation. But with little evidence and no corpse, Rosa's lawyer Mr. Grewgious (Alun Armstrong) and his funereal secretary Bazzard (David Dawson) begin investigating other possible motives for murder... and discover a long-buried secret.&#34;Masterpiece Classic: The Mystery of Edwin Drood&#34; is one of those mysteries where the question is not WHO did it, but HOW the crime will be uncovered -- and in the final act, what exactly happened. It's obvious from the very first shot of the movie who is going to commit the crimes, so the suspense comes from seeing the events that follow unfold, and the toll they take on the people present.The miniseries is half murder mystery (despite the lack of a corpse, Edwin is presumed dead... for some reason), and half study of John Jasper's slow descent into evil and madness. It also makes good use of Jasper's drug use, washing certain scenes in color, Dutch angles and weird distortions, as well as having lots of fun with crypts, shafts of pale light in a darkened church, and eerie scenes set in darkness.Fortunately, there is some lightness in the story, mostly provided by the hobbity Mr. Grewgious and his hilarious secretary. Bazzard is like a lost Monty Python character -- a sort of goth before there was goth, making dramatic complaints and occasionally talking in an awful Scottish accent.And all the actors do an excellent job as well. Rhys plays Jasper as a bitter creep fueled by his passionate desire for his nephew's fiancee, slowly descending into black-hearted, empty-eyed madness. Kinnear plays the exact opposite: a sweet, slightly naive man who is true to his Christian beliefs. Dhawan and Revah also give nice, barely restrained performances as the twins with a dark past, and Ron Cook as a weird undertaker who constantly refers to himself in the third person. As for Armstrong and Dawson, they should have their own wacky &#34;Psych&#34;-style series.The one big problem? The ending. Admittedly it's not surprising that the final act is not up to the standards of the preceding ones, since it was written by Gwyneth Hughes and not Charles Dickens. But for things to turn out properly, it needs a several coincidental meetings ALL AT THE SAME TIME. In fact, one of the characters pops up out of nowhere, having inexplicably told NO ONE where he was all this time. Really?&#34;Masterpiece Classic: The Mystery of Edwin Drood&#34; has a last act that stretches credibility badly, but the overall experience is an enjoyable one -- a twisted little mystery with some surprises at the finale.",4,Durdles likes this miniseries,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,4268,"['When', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'died', '1870', 'left', 'behind', 'half-finished', 'novel', 'called', '34', 'Mystery', 'Edwin', 'Drood.', '34', 'was', 'published', 'as-is', 'conclusion', 'publishers', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'started', 'hiring', 'people', 'finish', 'such', 'slight', 'obstacle', 'adapting', 'half-finished', 'book', 'how', 'do', 'adapt', 'story', 'entire', 'final', 'act', 'missing', 'including', 'revelation', 'who', 'committed', 'droodful', 'crime', 'Well', 'make', 'up', 'ending', 'big', 'splashy', 'climax', '34', 'Mystery', 'Edwin', 'Drood', '34', 'relies', 'too', 'heavily', 'convenient', 'timing', 'story', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'mixture', 'darkness', 'light', 'solid', 'acting', 'around.It', 'made', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'beginning', 'when', 'choirmaster', 'John', 'Jasper', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'opium-fueled', 'dream', 'murdering', 'nephew', 'Edwin', 'Drood', 'Freddie', 'Fox', 'Edwin', 'just', 'arrived', 'town', 'see', 'fiancee', 'Rosa', 'Bud', 'Tamzin', 'Merchant', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'particularly', 'eager', 'marry', 'same', 'time', 'kindly', 'Reverend', 'Crisparkle', 'Rory', 'Kinnear', 'half-English', 'twins', 'Neville', 'Sacha', 'Dhawan', 'Helena', 'Landless', 'Amber', 'Rose', 'Revah', 'houseguests', 'Neville', 'immediately', 'Edwin', 'whom', 'spoiled', 'unworthy', 'Rosa', 'Rosa', 'Edwin', 'engagement', 'final', 'turbulence', 'John', 'opium', 'nephew', 'madly', 'love', 'Rosa', 'Yes', 'big', 'spoiler', ""'re"", 'never', 'left', 'doubt', 'was', 'so', 'heavily', 'foreshadowed', 'right', 'first', 'scene', 'surprise.Of', 'course', 'Neville', 'immediately', 'suspected', 'got', 'two', 'fistfights', 'one', 'evening', 'Edwin', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'little', 'evidence', 'corpse', 'Rosa', 'lawyer', 'Mr.', 'Grewgious', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'funereal', 'secretary', 'Bazzard', 'David', 'Dawson', 'begin', 'investigating', 'other', 'possible', 'motives', 'murder', 'discover', 'long-buried', 'secret.', '34', 'Masterpiece', 'Classic', 'Mystery', 'Edwin', 'Drood', '34', 'one', 'mysteries', 'where', 'question', 'not', 'WHO', 'did', 'HOW', 'crime', 'will', 'be', 'uncovered', 'final', 'act', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'obvious', 'very', 'first', 'shot', 'movie', 'who', 'going', 'commit', 'crimes', 'suspense', 'seeing', 'events', 'follow', 'unfold', 'toll', 'take', 'people', 'present.The', 'miniseries', 'half', 'murder', 'mystery', 'lack', 'corpse', 'Edwin', 'presumed', 'dead', 'reason', 'half', 'study', 'John', 'Jasper', 'slow', 'descent', 'evil', 'madness', 'also', 'good', 'use', 'Jasper', 'drug', 'use', 'washing', 'certain', 'scenes', 'color', 'Dutch', 'angles', 'weird', 'distortions', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'lots', 'fun', 'crypts', 'shafts', 'pale', 'light', 'darkened', 'church', 'eerie', 'scenes', 'set', 'darkness.Fortunately', 'lightness', 'story', 'mostly', 'provided', 'hobbity', 'Mr.', 'Grewgious', 'hilarious', 'secretary', 'Bazzard', 'lost', 'Monty', 'Python', 'character', 'sort', 'goth', 'was', 'goth', 'making', 'dramatic', 'complaints', 'occasionally', 'talking', 'awful', 'Scottish', 'actors', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'Rhys', 'Jasper', 'bitter', 'creep', 'fueled', 'passionate', 'desire', 'nephew', 'fiancee', 'slowly', 'descending', 'black-hearted', 'empty-eyed', 'madness', 'Kinnear', 'exact', 'opposite', 'sweet', 'slightly', 'naive', 'man', 'who', 'true', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'Dhawan', 'Revah', 'also', 'give', 'nice', 'barely', 'restrained', 'performances', 'twins', 'dark', 'past', 'Ron', 'Cook', 'weird', 'undertaker', 'who', 'constantly', 'third', 'person', 'Armstrong', 'Dawson', 'should', 'have', 'own', 'wacky', '34', 'Psych', '34', 'series.The', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'ending', 'not', 'surprising', 'final', 'act', 'not', 'up', 'standards', 'preceding', 'ones', 'was', 'written', 'Gwyneth', 'Hughes', 'not', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'properly', 'several', 'coincidental', 'meetings', 'AT', 'THE', 'SAME', 'TIME', 'fact', 'one', 'characters', 'pops', 'up', 'nowhere', 'having', 'inexplicably', 'told', 'NO', 'ONE', 'where', 'was', 'time', 'Really', '34', 'Masterpiece', 'Classic', 'Mystery', 'Edwin', 'Drood', '34', 'last', 'act', 'credibility', 'badly', 'overall', 'experience', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'twisted', 'little', 'mystery', 'surprises', 'finale']",Masterpiece Classic: The Mystery of Edwin Drood

1527776,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0077PBPVE,Kevin Killian,"[0, 1]","Spoilers ahead!  Of course the novel ended after only 50 percent of the book was written--there was the ""Sapsea Fragment,"" though some think Dickens didn't write that piece at all, and that it was the product of Forster's hand  Dickens did sketch out notes; and he instructed the artist he had chosen to illustrate the periodical version for which he was writing month to month, on the sorts of things that would be needed in the second half, and that's why Drood nerds--the ""Druids"" as they are sometimes known--have been arguing about this novel for many many years.  It takes big balls to go ahead and finish it, but on the other hand it's almost irresistible.Part of the problem is what we know of the plot seems irretrievable obvious.  Many are convinced that Jasper, in a fit of opium induced madness (""wickedness"" is the word constantly in play in the novel) kills his beloved nephew and throws him into the quicklime of the cathedral underbelly.  And that the second half of the book would feature Dick Datchery bringing Jasper to justice.  But if this is the case, argued the Victorian writer Andrew Lang, there is no mystery whatsoever, except that it seems clear that Datchery himself is someone else we have already met under another guise, and his unmasking might provide a surprise.  And so, there have been zillions of continuations, but a paucity of actual suspects outside of Jasper.The BBC version shows an awareness of many of these issues and actually surprised me with an unexpected ending.  As soon as Datchery starts inquiring (in some scenes definitely not written by Dickens) into the career of the elder Edwin Drood (thought to be long dead), well, my little mind was going, No!  They can't be playing it that way!  But play it they did and by Gad, I liked it!  The post-colonialist reading of Edwin Drood is especially marked in the new second half, but you figure, Dickens was going somewhere with the Landless pair, they weren't just dropped out of India into Cloisterham without a social justice point to make.  My friend Alistair Johnston has complained on his blog that not one single font visible in any of the many words, signs, or texts visible in this film had been invented in the 19th century, so that to a specialist like himself the show is unwatchable and, he would argue, even to one without any knowledge of typography, one's unconscious registers the disparity and smells out the falsity anyhow.  For me it was the casting that disappointed.  Matthew Rhys was fine in the part of Jasper but just too magnetic and charismatic to play the unassuming sad sack guy no one notices slipping in and out of Princess Puffer's opium joint.  Why get someone who smoulders more than Olivier, more than Logan on Veronica Mars?  And on the other hand, the young people are all properly young, but they're all ugly!  Rosa Bud is supposed to be gorgeous, well, a perfect flower, but this girl reminds me of Sissy Spacek in the last scenes of Carrie, and Edwin Drood is like something John Jasper scraped off of his shoe, what a mess.  The actor is called Freddie Fox and both first name and last name are lies!  Oh, I know, does anyone remember the US movie of 1980,""FAME""?  And Paul McCrane played the young, sad, gay boy mooning over the comedian boy?  Paul McCrane when he still had hair (big, permed. Bozo hair) and his name was Montgomery?

1527777,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0077PBPVE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[13, 13]","I have always been fascinated by Charles Dickens' final and unfinished novel ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood."" It is a work that practically screams for different interpretations seeing that the project was left completely open-ended. And I've seen a lot of different takes on the material from the 1935 movie with Claude Rains to the stark 1993 British film and even the quirky musical (which opened in 1985 with Betty Buckley) that relied on audience participation to round out the solution. At heart, it is a tale that combines elements of the horror genre with those of a mystery to tell the sordid tale of a popular young man who goes missing. This Masterpiece Theater presentation takes the expected liberties but does maintain a distinctly Dickensian feel. It is structured in basically three narrative segments (over two installments). In the opening, we meet a cast of eclectic characters. After the disappearance, the film revolves around a couple of investigations that may have relevance to what happened. And the final bit pulls the major players together for a lengthy exposition describing the mystery's answer.The story stars a committed Matthew Rhys as the sweaty, opium addicted John Jasper. Freddie Fox plays the titular hero, his nephew who seems to have it all. And Tamzin Merchant is the woman they both love. The other colorful characters include an enabling landlady, a opium purveyor, a well-meaning reverend, siblings from overseas, and a crypt keeper and his young assistant. There are a lot of characters to juggle in the opening sequences and, truthfully, some of their interactions didn't seem quite organic. This interpretation simply forced events that needed to happen without making them feel especially real. Still, the cast is engaging enough and up until the disappearance, things were on a pretty entertaining tract. While I was pleasantly involved in the set-up, though, I can't say the latter part of the show held up quite so well. Major characters vanished while others strove for answers to several different questions. But oddly, I was never connected to the pursuit of truth. And in the end, everything is wrapped up in lots and lots of dialogue that lost my interest completely.If anything, I'd say this version suffers from a genuine lack of suspense. Merchant is nice enough, I suppose, but I'm not sure why she instantly bewitched every major character. And, as I mentioned earlier, I felt some of the principles lacked a noticeable motivation to interact the way they did. As I had only a tenuous connection to the characters, I really couldn't muster much excitement for the mystery. And the final resolutions were too pat and almost amateurishly written to explain every plot point away with convenience. Still, if you like Masterpiece Theater, I might make a tentative recommendation. Some of the smaller roles are quite amusing and Rhys is quite terrific. I would have loved to see his enthusiasm brought to a similar project with a better screenplay.

Secaur ""Meredith Secaur""","[27, 29]","Being something of a Dickens purist, I very rarely watch new adaptations of his novels, television or otherwise, and after being badly disappointed by the BBC's 2011 soap-opera-like adaptation of ""Great Expectations"", I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film; in fact, I didn't even catch it when it first aired on PBS. After reading the novel (or half of one, anyway), I really wanted to see this and find out just what kind of ending the filmmakers came up with. I was astonished at just how excellent it was, and would rank it as one of the best productions of Dickens I've seen since ""David Copperfield"".""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" was Charles Dickens' last novel; he was only able to complete half of it before he died in 1870. He intended his story to be a thriller, requesting that his publisher accept the book in twelve parts instead of the usual twenty. That being said, the film reflects that ideal in spades, clipping along at a nice pace that rivals even the best modern-day mystery novel and incorporating a healthy dose of psychological drama for extra suspense. The dramatic tension is there from the very first scene and doesn't let up until the end credits roll. Highly atmospheric and oftentimes chilling, it would be hard to imagine a more ideal production.The second half falters a little bit, owing to the the lack of true Dickensian dialogue and plotting, but the numerous twists and turns and surprising character development never really feel as though he couldn't have written them himself. Some people might dislike the ending, but I found it unexpected and very appropriate. Dickens wasn't above resorting to using the ""deus ex machina"" device himself, so who's to say it doesn't belong here? While he probably had a different though equally surprising finale in mind, the one devised by screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes isn't exactly shabby.The only real reservation I had about this film was that it would feel too ""modern"". To my delight, the historical side of the film is never once questioned: there's never a single moment over the course of all two hours where you don't feel that you're truly in 19th century England. The fact that it was actually filmed in Rochester, Kent, the place where Dickens based the fictional town of Cloisterham upon, with much time spent inside the real Rochester Cathedral, just gives it a whole new layer of authenticity.I was also quite impressed with the cast. Not only do they look their parts, but they also perform them flawlessly, giving real yet Dickenesque portrayals. Freddie Fox is entirely wonderful as Edwin Drood, literally embodying the phrase ""laissez-faire"". Tamzin Merchant is a steady yet perhaps a little too pert Rosa Bud, but that would be my only complaint. The true star of the show is Welsh actor Matthew Rhys, who just lives and breathes the dark, brooding, obsessive opium-smoker John Jasper. He brings out the character's passive-agressiveness to perfection, and his intense, emotional performance will keep you on the edge of your seat.In short, I absolutely loved BBC/Masterpiece's 2012 adaptation of ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"", and would recommend it to anyone as one film not to be missed.",5,A haunting and very Dickensian Drood...,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,3191,"['Being', 'something', 'Dickens', 'purist', 'very', 'rarely', 'watch', 'new', 'adaptations', 'novels', 'television', 'otherwise', 'being', 'badly', 'disappointed', 'BBC', '2011', 'soap-opera-like', 'adaptation', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'catch', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'PBS', 'reading', 'novel', 'half', 'one', 'anyway', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'kind', 'ending', 'filmmakers', 'came', 'up', 'was', 'astonished', 'just', 'how', 'excellent', 'was', 'would', 'rank', 'one', 'best', 'productions', 'Dickens', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'Mystery', 'Edwin', 'Drood', 'was', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'last', 'novel', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'complete', 'half', 'died', '1870', 'intended', 'story', 'be', 'thriller', 'requesting', 'publisher', 'accept', 'book', 'twelve', 'parts', 'instead', 'usual', 'twenty', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'ideal', 'spades', 'clipping', 'along', 'nice', 'pace', 'rivals', 'even', 'best', 'modern-day', 'mystery', 'novel', 'incorporating', 'healthy', 'dose', 'psychological', 'drama', 'extra', 'suspense', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'there', 'very', 'first', 'scene', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'end', 'roll', 'Highly', 'atmospheric', 'oftentimes', 'chilling', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'imagine', 'more', 'ideal', 'production.The', 'second', 'half', 'little', 'bit', 'owing', 'lack', 'true', 'Dickensian', 'dialogue', 'plotting', 'numerous', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprising', 'character', 'development', 'never', 'really', 'feel', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'written', 'people', 'might', 'dislike', 'ending', 'found', 'unexpected', 'very', 'appropriate', 'Dickens', 'was', ""n't"", 'resorting', 'using', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'device', 'who', 'say', ""n't"", 'belong', 'here', 'probably', 'had', 'different', 'equally', 'surprising', 'finale', 'mind', 'one', 'devised', 'screenwriter', 'Gwyneth', 'Hughes', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'only', 'real', 'reservation', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'would', 'feel', 'too', 'modern', 'delight', 'historical', 'side', 'film', 'never', 'once', 'questioned', 'never', 'single', 'moment', 'course', 'two', 'hours', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'truly', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'fact', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Rochester', 'Kent', 'place', 'where', 'Dickens', 'based', 'fictional', 'town', 'Cloisterham', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'real', 'Rochester', 'Cathedral', 'just', 'whole', 'new', 'layer', 'authenticity.I', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'impressed', 'cast', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'look', 'parts', 'also', 'perform', 'flawlessly', 'giving', 'real', 'yet', 'Dickenesque', 'portrayals', 'Freddie', 'Fox', 'entirely', 'wonderful', 'Edwin', 'Drood', 'literally', 'embodying', 'phrase', 'laissez-faire', 'Tamzin', 'Merchant', 'steady', 'yet', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'pert', 'Rosa', 'Bud', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'complaint', 'true', 'star', 'show', 'Welsh', 'actor', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'who', 'just', 'lives', 'dark', 'brooding', 'obsessive', 'opium-smoker', 'John', 'Jasper', 'out', 'character', 'passive-agressiveness', 'perfection', 'intense', 'emotional', 'performance', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat.In', 'short', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'BBC/Masterpiece', '2012', 'adaptation', 'Mystery', 'Edwin', 'Drood', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'one', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Masterpiece Classic: The Mystery of Edwin Drood
