1219159,A29RUNZT2H2GCU,B001N9VW5Y,Ann Sherry,"[1, 1]","This dvd is great.  However, before you purchase check to see if this episode is included in one of the volumes of &#34;Family Guy&#34;, since it says on the cover: &#34;A classic 'Family Guy' episode re-released for the holiday season&#34;.  I did see it on Adult Swim before.It is too expensive at over $20 if you already have this episode on dvd.  I got mine with a 'Daily Deal' offer and paid about $8.00, with free shipping as a member of Prime.It has the advantage of being able to keep with your other Xmas dvds, so you don't have to search and search your volumes for it when you may especially want to see it during the holidays.The episode is probably from 2001.  It is full frame, wonderfully colorful, and a good one.  Peter gives away all their Xmas presents to a Toys for Tots equivalent, and while Brian is home alone the Xmas tree burns down, and the turkey in the oven starts a fire in the kitchen.Included is a &#34;never-released on dvd&#34; episode of a Xmas-themed &#34;American Dad&#34;.  Again, you should check the volumes you own first to see if you already have it.  It was probably shown in 2007.  It may have since been included in a volume you already have.  I've seen it on tv.Tho both episodes are delightful, I would not pay the going price for it.  It was worth the price I got it for.  You may want to put this on your Wish List and hope it comes up again on a good sale.The &#34;American Dad&#34; episode is a great one, as Stan goes in search of a Xmas tree in the wild and meets with a fatal accident.  Again, it has the advantage of being to just go to this dvd at holiday time so you can find it conveniently.",5,Freakin Good but Too Pricey,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1648,"['dvd', 'great', 'However', 'purchase', 'check', 'see', 'episode', 'included', 'one', 'volumes', '34', 'Family', 'Guy', '34', 'cover', '34', 'A', 'classic', ""'Family"", 'Guy', 'episode', 're-released', 'holiday', 'season', '34', 'did', 'see', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'before.It', 'too', 'expensive', '20', 'already', 'have', 'episode', 'dvd', 'got', 'mine', ""'Daily"", 'Deal', 'offer', 'paid', '8.00', 'free', 'shipping', 'member', 'Prime.It', 'advantage', 'being', 'able', 'keep', 'other', 'Xmas', 'dvds', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'search', 'search', 'volumes', 'when', 'may', 'especially', 'want', 'see', 'holidays.The', 'episode', 'probably', '2001', 'full', 'frame', 'wonderfully', 'colorful', 'good', 'one', 'Peter', 'away', 'Xmas', 'presents', 'Toys', 'Tots', 'equivalent', 'Brian', 'home', 'alone', 'Xmas', 'tree', 'burns', 'down', 'turkey', 'oven', 'fire', 'kitchen.Included', '34', 'never-released', 'dvd', '34', 'episode', 'Xmas-themed', '34', 'American', 'Dad', '34', 'Again', 'should', 'check', 'volumes', 'own', 'first', 'see', 'already', 'have', 'was', 'probably', 'shown', '2007', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'volume', 'already', 'have', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'are', 'delightful', 'would', 'not', 'pay', 'going', 'price', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'got', 'may', 'want', 'put', 'Wish', 'List', 'hope', 'up', 'again', 'good', 'sale.The', '34', 'American', 'Dad', '34', 'episode', 'great', 'one', 'Stan', 'search', 'Xmas', 'tree', 'wild', 'meets', 'fatal', 'accident', 'Again', 'advantage', 'being', 'just', 'go', 'dvd', 'holiday', 'time', 'can', 'find', 'conveniently']",A Very Special Freakin Family Guy Christmas
