This one is a winner in my book. I would prefer not to talk about the plot but say that I found emotionally true thestruggles of a girl growing up without a father and usinga substitute - in this case a film fantasy about a father. The child's relationship with a troubled boy her own age, her younger brother who displaces her as the favoritge, hermother who is herself conflicted about parenthood, and a usually kind stepfather pull on the heartstrings.

This film made me think it was not going to be the well constructed story that it became. I think this added to the impact as it unfolded to be a very endearing film about the life of two kids growing up around cinema. I had accidently purchased two copies of this film and was glad to have something this wonderful to give to someone.Another wonderful example of a Chinese movie with a real story that Hollywood has not been willing to provide.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","From 2004, this Chinese film begs to be compared to the International hit ""Cinema Paradiso"" through a quote used extensively in its marketing campaign.  Truthfully, the reference does the film no favor as this is really not in the same category.  Aside from a wistful and nostalgic reverence for movies, the films share little common ground.  And yet, it is still a hard film not to like.  Exploring a back story set in the Cultural Revolution in China, a modern day act of violence starts to unravel a family's troubled history of loss and recriminations.  The flashback scenes (although sometimes overplayed) tell an interesting story, but the movie is reliant on huge coincidences and unexplained plot developments (for those that have seen it, how is that apartment paid for?) to drive the modern tale.  It's heart is certainly in the right place and it will tug at your emotions, but it ends up playing more as magical realism than I would have liked.

I wasn't watching the clock so this is a guess, but I bet for the first 35 minutes or so I kept feeling like I was 2 minutes from bailing out and returning it to the library unfinished. I just felt it wasn't what I'd hoped it would be, though I don't know what I'd hoped it would be.Then when the little boy arrives, and yes he's a brat for a while, the friendship forged by the little girl and him really sucked me into the movie. It just seemed very sweet and real. Not real for me, I never had any childhood friendships like this, but it still seems possible.A coincidence here and a coincidence there... more than would probably ever stack up in real life, but do we always watch movies for a deadly realistic version of everything? I don't.20 minutes into it I was thinking it was to be a dry little foreign film that won some arty awards but has no heart. It turned into a great, little masterpiece about friends and the movies.

990177,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FI8MG6,Tsuyoshi,"[9, 9]","Jiang Xiao's feature debt film `Electric Shadows' requires a bit of suspension of disbelief - slightly patchy script needs polishing up, having more than one unbelievable coincidences - but her sincere attitudes toward the film's material are no doubt genuine, and I promise this emotional film ultimately delivers.`Electric Shadows' employs a very familiar storytelling device, reading of someone's journal. The time is set in modern Beijing, where an avid moviegoer Mao Dabing encounters a mentally disturbed girl in a most bizarre way. That is, she hits him in the head with a brick, and while being questioned about her motives for doing that by the police, she entrusts Mao with the key to her room.You have to believe this incredible introductory part because it is in her room (or diary) that the real story begins. In the following flashbacks, the film goes back to the year 1971 when a young beautiful woman dreaming of becoming a movie star in a rural Chinese town unexpectedly gets pregnant, and gives birth to a girl named Ling Ling.The film really gets underway when it depicts the life of little girl Ling Ling, whose life is surrounded by the world of cinema. Ling Ling is often taken care of by the kind middle-aged projectionist (here is an echo from `Cinema Paradiso'), who manages the screening of films in the community's vacant lot. Ling Ling also establishes friendship with a boy newly arrived, and all these episodes are told beautifully against the backdrop of the history of modern-day China.There are several references to the films popular among the Chinese people - Albanian film `Victory Over Death' plays an important role - and footages from Chinese films are inserted, but you don't have to know about these film, which strengthens the authentic feelings of the community in a Chinese town in the early 70s.The story often gets melodramatic as it goes on, and sometimes it is too sentimental. The `frame' part of the film looks contrived, and some part of the story is too unbelievable (for example, how could the girl living in the big city of Beijing manage to live in such a nice room?)But the strong story of Ling Ling will remain with you, with the sure hand of the director who knows something about growing-up and coping with the reality of life for a child. And the two child actors who played two Ling Lings are so good and adorable. `Electric Shadows' is a bitter sweet tale of childhood memories. Sometimes too bitter, but it is all the more worthwhile because of that.",4,"Moving, Bitter Sweet Tale of Childhood in China",1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,2513,"['Jiang', 'Xiao', 'feature', 'debt', 'film', 'Electric', 'Shadows', 'bit', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'slightly', 'patchy', 'script', 'needs', 'polishing', 'up', 'having', 'more', 'one', 'unbelievable', 'coincidences', 'sincere', 'attitudes', 'film', 'material', 'are', 'doubt', 'genuine', 'promise', 'emotional', 'film', 'ultimately', 'delivers.', 'Electric', 'Shadows', 'very', 'familiar', 'storytelling', 'device', 'reading', 'someone', 'journal', 'time', 'set', 'modern', 'Beijing', 'where', 'avid', 'moviegoer', 'Mao', 'Dabing', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'girl', 'most', 'bizarre', 'way', 'head', 'brick', 'being', 'questioned', 'motives', 'doing', 'police', 'Mao', 'key', 'room.You', 'have', 'believe', 'incredible', 'introductory', 'part', 'room', 'diary', 'real', 'story', 'begins', 'following', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'back', 'year', '1971', 'when', 'young', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'dreaming', 'becoming', 'movie', 'star', 'rural', 'Chinese', 'town', 'unexpectedly', 'pregnant', 'birth', 'girl', 'named', 'Ling', 'Ling.The', 'film', 'really', 'underway', 'when', 'life', 'little', 'girl', 'Ling', 'Ling', 'life', 'surrounded', 'world', 'cinema', 'Ling', 'Ling', 'often', 'taken', 'care', 'kind', 'middle-aged', 'projectionist', 'here', 'echo', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'who', 'screening', 'films', 'community', 'vacant', 'lot', 'Ling', 'Ling', 'also', 'friendship', 'boy', 'newly', 'arrived', 'episodes', 'are', 'told', 'beautifully', 'backdrop', 'history', 'modern-day', 'China.There', 'are', 'several', 'references', 'films', 'popular', 'Chinese', 'people', 'Albanian', 'film', 'Victory', 'Death', 'plays', 'important', 'role', 'footages', 'Chinese', 'films', 'are', 'inserted', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'film', 'authentic', 'feelings', 'community', 'Chinese', 'town', 'early', '70s.The', 'story', 'often', 'melodramatic', 'sometimes', 'too', 'sentimental', 'frame', 'part', 'film', 'contrived', 'part', 'story', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'example', 'how', 'could', 'girl', 'living', 'big', 'city', 'Beijing', 'manage', 'live', 'such', 'nice', 'room', 'strong', 'story', 'Ling', 'Ling', 'will', 'remain', 'sure', 'hand', 'director', 'who', 'something', 'growing-up', 'coping', 'reality', 'life', 'child', 'two', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'two', 'Ling', 'Lings', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'adorable', 'Electric', 'Shadows', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'tale', 'childhood', 'memories', 'Sometimes', 'too', 'bitter', 'more', 'worthwhile']",N/A
