However the over repetition of information and the same with the photography made the whole series much longer than it really needed to be. It probably could have been done with 2 DVDs instead of 4. As they say, art is the essence, meaning that if you want to define something do it in as little space as possible to crystallize the idea of what is being portrayed. It is small wonder I kept falling asleep while watching it. It kept dragging out longer and longer.",3,"Very Interesting information, but too much repetition.",1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,628,"['material', 'went', 'over', 'was', 'depth', 'very', 'interesting', 'modern', 'history', 'submarining', 'course', 'submarine', 'recent', 'history', 'mostly', 'way', 'However', 'repetition', 'information', 'same', 'photography', 'made', 'whole', 'series', 'much', 'longer', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', '2', 'DVDs', 'instead', '4', 'say', 'art', 'essence', 'meaning', 'want', 'define', 'something', 'do', 'as', 'little', 'space', 'possible', 'crystallize', 'idea', 'what', 'being', 'portrayed', 'small', 'wonder', 'kept', 'falling', 'asleep', 'watching', 'kept', 'dragging', 'out', 'longer', 'longer']",N/A
