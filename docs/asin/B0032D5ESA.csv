1318313,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0032D5ESA,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[5, 10]","This movie is unbearable. It's ridiculously gross and obsene and while I understand that that was the point I still see no value in recommending this movie to anyone. The ""movie"" also seems to have no plot to speak of, nor is there any character within the characters of this movie. I can't describe the movie: it's impossible. But i'll say this: if your goal for entertainment is to be competely repulsed then by all means watch away. Beyond that this movie has no redeeming qualities. It tells no story. It's supposedly meant to be artistically shot on a handheld camera but it makes what your watching grainy and often unfocused. And last it's pointless. It has no relevance to the world of horror, suspence, or thriller films....I'm unsatisfied with what is written above. So I'll add this: I regret watching any of this movie. Often I found myself skipping minutes ahead to see if it would ever start to make sense. It never did and now I'm left with a nightmarish image of one of the last scenes of the film. The scene portrays both acts of necrophilia and paedophilia. Now because of the method in which I watched the film I caught only the tail end. But it was enough. This movie needs banned or removed from shelves. I'll never say that about any movie I see or book I read but this film deserves to be deleted from history.",1,Um...

This is the second entry in the trilogy and is by far the nastiest, sleaziest, and most disgusting. Nevertheless, it never comes off as forced or improbable. The movie looks honest and real for what it is. I give the actors/actresses an unspeakable amount of credit for this! I dare anyone to go through what they went through to make this film. And it might do good to mention that just because an actor/actress acts out certain things in a movie does not mean that that's what they do for fun on their own spare time. ITS A MOVIE!!! It's supposed to be honest and the cast was UNBELIEVABLY true to the characters created for the film. Remember people, not everyone is the same or thinks the same. We are all different people and there certainly are people out there like this so it's wrong to say that these characters are in any way not believable. The acting is as good as it possibly gets for what the movie is. Which is a ""found footage"" torture/exploitation/horror godsend. This is the real deal in underground extreme horror. Prepare yourself for the most disturbing movie you will ever see. And do yourself a favor and don't ever be caught watching this by anyone you care about or they will really start to judge your character :) enjoy and don't forget to watch the final movie PENANCE (the best in my opinion).

Yeah there were disgusting parts in this movie but they were so badly done that it just seemed kinda comical.The special effects were cheesy, also was the acting, and I was so tired of the hand held camera just shaking back and forth.  Please rent this if you are still interested in seeing this film, don't buy it.  Its way too much money for a film so ridiculously done.  U will regret it when you're done watching the film.If u like low budget cheesy movies than this is for you.
