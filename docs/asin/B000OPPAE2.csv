Between his going and coming is a sequence of vignettes that become increasingly tiresome and meaningless.  None of the characters gains anything in the way of wisdom, understanding, or wiles.Michel Simon is outstanding as the old man who gives the boy a temporary refuge, but Alain Cohen, as the youthful protagonist, appears to lack the ability to carry off the demands of his role.

1065044,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B000OPPAE2,Gerard D. Launay,"[0, 0]","I saw this movie when it was first released 45 years ago. - enjoyed it - but was not overwhelmed.  Having seen thousands of films later, I selected the film to see again...and was bowled over.  I notice things differently now that I am over 60.  Today, I would rank this among my favorite movies of all time.World War II France under the Occupation. The movie begins with a young Jewish boy getting constantly in trouble in Paris, but his parents are in hiding.  By drawing attention to himself, he puts his mother and father at risk. The father is furious, and justly so, but the mother is overprotective and loving, no matter what.  The solution is to send him to the South of France with a different family and with a different name to wait out the war.I have to say I empathize with the father.  Trivial behavior did end up in disaster for Jews in France.  But this is not really the center of the film at all.  As the other reviews indicate, it is about an improbable friendship between the boy and the old man whom he is sent to live. Partners in mischief, perhaps...they develop a beautiful friendship.  The old man needs someone to talk to and the boy needs a comforting father figure.  The irony is that the man is an anti-semite with ridiculous prejudices and the young boy is (secretly) a Jewish boy. But the love of a father figure and a young boy that they depict is so real.The strength of the picture? The cinematography is splendid...the choice of natural sounds of the woods or the music is equally good. But it is the performances of the two that makes this a GREAT picture.  Both are absolute naturals in their roles. The man with the silly ideas about Jews but otherwise loveable personality is brilliantly captured by Michel Simone. And Alain Cohen is undoubtedly playing himself...a kind, affectionate young boy with a penchant for mischief.  It is hard not to be captivated.In so many ways, this film does NOT follow the typical trope of Silas Marner wannabees - grumpy old man who learns kindness by taking care of a child (See ""The Butterfly"", ""Kolya"", ""Despicable Me"" for examples). The man does not change...he is a decent man, very kind to animals, but who has every wrong idea about liberals, Jews, politics.  The  boy enjoys poking fun at these.The ending feels real without being forced.  I simply cannot praise the performances enough.  What is missing in so many films today is ""charm.""

Cinematography and photography were superb, and think how old the production is! The script lacks pretensions and the younger casts outdid themselves. I particularly liked the young girl, and have been touched by her innocent eyes and affectionate smile.The relationship between a grumpily happy old man and a precocious child has been drawn with so much sympathy and the greatest skill of the director is this: to be able to hold the shadow of a great war over the lives of few simple French villagers, yet, to show their moments of pure joy and happiness, their spontaneous humanity, without minimizing war's trauma.

1065047,A1FJCJJ6YLIU2K,B000OPPAE2,"M. Derby ""drone45""","[3, 4]","The guy who played the old man wasn't summoned from a nearby street corner.  Revered actor Michel Simon comfortably inhabits the character of Pepe.  Simon was a veteran of over 100 performances, dating back to Carl Dreyer's late-'20s cinematic tone poem The Passion of Joan of Arc.  Long beloved of French audiences by the time this film was made:  this isn't the final role in his career but among his later ones.An inestimable moment among many is Pepe and M&egrave;m&egrave;'s passive-aggressive struggle over possibly being late to Mass.  The husband's blessedly irascible indifference frustrates his wife's attempts to ""help"" (i.e. meddle) with the child's bathing (not ill-intentioned, but hardly motivated by motherly care).  Serendipitously, this helps Claude maintain privacy not only for his body, but also his identity.  It's an amusing vignette:  but had things happened only a little bit differently, this could have been a matter of life and death.  Note the subtlety of the performance from the boy (Alain Cohen), particularly his watchful eyes, and how--until one crucial moment--he takes care to conceal himself without calling too much attention to the fact.Not certain why The Two of Us was chosen over the film's original title, which translates literally as The Old Man and the Child (Le vieil homme et l'enfant).  But could either have more aptly reflected--in their simplicity--the charm of this story?Consider the following.  Who hasn't struggled with this?  Think of that acquaintance or co-worker (we all know at least one)--who occasionally spews venom toward a traditionally-despised class--yet is typically so cheerful, so seemingly nice.  WHAT to do??  Tell them you're offended?  You suspect they're unlikely to change, and--if you do speak out--neither of you will be comfortable talking with one another ever again.  How would this be of benefit for anyone?  But in remaining silent, do you implicitly approve of bigotry?SPOILER ALERT -- In dual reviews (one from the time of the theatrical release, one recently), Roger Ebert explores this dilemma.  He argues convincingly that The Two of Us would have been a less satisfying film had the plot taken a more-predictable course, such as:  the old man accidentally learns of the boy's heritage, and is forced to reassess his prejudices.  What an improbable ""conversion,"" intended to please (read:  pander to) the audience in their desire for simplicity of a different kind.In this story, young Claude is the character who changes.  Had he not learned forgiveness toward those who fail to understand him entirely, his life would have been more frustrating, and it seems likely he would have made fewer friends.",5,"Thanks, Criterion, for bringing us this no-longer-rare gem",1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,2690,"['guy', 'who', 'played', 'old', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'summoned', 'nearby', 'street', 'corner', 'Revered', 'actor', 'Michel', 'Simon', 'comfortably', 'character', 'Pepe', 'Simon', 'was', 'veteran', '100', 'performances', 'dating', 'back', 'Carl', 'Dreyer', ""late-'20s"", 'cinematic', 'tone', 'poem', 'Passion', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Long', 'beloved', 'French', 'audiences', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', ""n't"", 'final', 'role', 'career', 'later', 'ones.An', 'inestimable', 'moment', 'many', 'Pepe', 'M', 'egrave', 'egrave', 'passive-aggressive', 'struggle', 'possibly', 'being', 'late', 'Mass', 'husband', 'blessedly', 'irascible', 'indifference', 'wife', 'attempts', 'help', 'i.e', 'meddle', 'child', 'bathing', 'not', 'ill-intentioned', 'hardly', 'motivated', 'motherly', 'care', 'Serendipitously', 'Claude', 'maintain', 'privacy', 'not', 'only', 'body', 'also', 'identity', 'amusing', 'vignette', 'had', 'things', 'happened', 'only', 'little', 'bit', 'differently', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'matter', 'life', 'death', 'Note', 'subtlety', 'performance', 'boy', 'Alain', 'Cohen', 'particularly', 'watchful', 'eyes', 'how', 'one', 'crucial', 'moment', 'care', 'conceal', 'calling', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'fact.Not', 'certain', 'why', 'Two', 'Us', 'was', 'chosen', 'film', 'original', 'title', 'literally', 'Old', 'Man', 'Child', 'Le', 'vieil', 'homme', 'et', ""l'enfant"", 'could', 'either', 'have', 'more', 'aptly', 'reflected', 'simplicity', 'charm', 'story', 'Consider', 'following', 'Who', ""n't"", 'struggled', 'Think', 'acquaintance', 'co-worker', 'know', 'least', 'one', 'who', 'occasionally', 'venom', 'traditionally-despised', 'class', 'typically', 'so', 'cheerful', 'so', 'seemingly', 'nice', 'WHAT', 'do', 'Tell', ""'re"", 'offended', 'suspect', ""'re"", 'unlikely', 'change', 'do', 'speak', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'comfortable', 'talking', 'one', 'ever', 'again', 'How', 'would', 'be', 'benefit', 'anyone', 'remaining', 'silent', 'do', 'implicitly', 'approve', 'bigotry', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'dual', 'reviews', 'one', 'time', 'theatrical', 'release', 'one', 'recently', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'dilemma', 'convincingly', 'Two', 'Us', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'satisfying', 'film', 'had', 'plot', 'taken', 'more-predictable', 'course', 'such', 'old', 'man', 'accidentally', 'boy', 'heritage', 'forced', 'reassess', 'prejudices', 'What', 'improbable', 'conversion', 'intended', 'please', 'read', 'pander', 'audience', 'desire', 'simplicity', 'different', 'kind.In', 'story', 'young', 'Claude', 'character', 'who', 'Had', 'not', 'learned', 'forgiveness', 'who', 'fail', 'understand', 'entirely', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'frustrating', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'fewer', 'friends']",The Two of Us

It gives us a personal look Occupied France, anti-Semitism, and the needs of two people who have lost their connections.  The way the movie brings these two characters, an old man and a boy, together is intelligently done.  Once they're united, the movie really takes off.The boy is a Jewish child from Paris whose mischeviousness seems to draw a lot of attention to himself; just what his parents don't need.  The opportunity comes to send him to live with the elderly parents of a friend in the countryside near Grenoble.  The elderly man is most definitely NOT Jewish.  Our young hero finds himself alone in a strange place.  The old man can't understand or even abide his children and he and his wife seem to spend much of their time in disagreement with one another.  Our elderly hero finds himself alone in a familiar place.  They readily take to each other and the beauty of the film is how it portrays the genisis and growth of their relationship.  There is much that is said about the time and place that this film took place in.  However, the extremes of France in 1944 merely serve as an amplifier to the story of a most unusual friendship.The acting and directing were superb in ""The Two of Us"".  To be honest, I won't remember the names but I WILL remember their preformances.  I kept wondering where did they find the guy who plays the old man.
