The routine became so ridiculous, rambling, incoherent and obnoxious that it's not at all enjoyable. It's almost as if he's making it up as he goes along.. He sounded like a bum on the street corner talking to himself.The first fifteen minutes was pointless and pretentious too. Fifteen minutes of him telling us he's bigger than he is because he toured Canada and parts of Europe..by bus.. and all of the black guys tell us that they hate being on the bus because they all stink and have bad body odor...I'm also getting tired of this double standard where certain people can use words that others can't use, and they use them as almost every other word.. and also use reverse racist language which others would never be able to get away with without a firestorm of controversy. It's old, it's annoying, it's uncalled for.. and it's not culture, it's just low class and shows a lack of intelligence and empathy. At times, Kevin reduces himself to a negative stereotype.At one point in the opening, one guy in Europe said ""Soul Plane was a great movie and it's the best work to date"".... Even D.L. Hughley apologized in his concert for even being a part of ""Soul Plane"".. I had a DVD of Soul Plane I couldn't give away .. No self respecting person, black or white, wanted that piece of junk.This was just a mess just like ""Soul Plane""..I don't know if Kevin was high, if he's attempting to be hardcore or what.. It just ... wasn't funny.. and this ...halting ... way ... of how ... he tells ....his stories .... has gotten .... to the point ... of motion sickness.. But he reminds me of Martin Lawrence's Runteldat...btw, ..where is Martin Lawrence today? exactly.. and Kevin Hart is going to fade away soon enough because it's becoming apparent that there's nothing to see here...",1,Downward Spiral....

1667655,AHDJ6Q2QGL9DM,B00EKR61BQ,Marifrances,"[10, 14]","I'm a huge Kevin Hart fan. I eagerly awaited this movie, and as soon as it hit Redbox, I rented it and watched it.Ultimately, it was a let-down, and confusing as well.The first part of the movie was funny, and when Kevin pledged to ""Explain"" a lot of things, I was all ears.But then the film took a bizarre and unexpected turn into megalomania which was boring and baffling (I ended up skipping it). Who was Kevin trying to impress? Obviously, not the fans watching the movie who don't care if he killed Denmark or not. We're just there for the jokes.Finally, the Madison Square Garden performance began, but something was off. Although the stage caught fire, Kevin never did. He failed to hit his stride, but I kept waiting.There is no doubt about it that Kevin is a genius. His physical actions and voices are usually so spot on, he's like a brilliant, one-man Shakespeare play. But very little of this sparkling genius was evident in this lackluster and ""phoning-it-in"" performance.I did not even seen him go to his physical edge with his physical actions and facial expressions like he usually does; it just seemed to me he wasn't trying.His material was half-*ssed and poorly edited. It just seemed to be a random hodge-podge of leftover standup he decided to make into a new show. He made few, if any, unique observations about life. He was mildly funny, but nowhere was his genius evident.In addition, I did not feel he ""Explained"" anything he said he would at the beginning of the show. I thought there was going to be a comedic payoff for the beginning of the jokes planted at the beginning of the show. There never was. The audience was left holding the bag.On the production side, there were tons of distracting cuts to hysterically-laughing audience members interspersed, without rhythm, throughout the show. I found myself questioning if I was watching the same show they were?I'm not sure why, but Kevin was off on this one. But he is a true genius, so I know his next project will be classic Kevin.I'm still a huge Kevin fan and always will be!!

1667656,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00EKR61BQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","There are concert films released of comics all the time. The most confusing thing these days is to know which came first, their being comics or having starred movies. It seems the two are connected more often than not. In the case of Kevin Hart my first exposure to him was via movies and TV. Now that I've had a chance to see his stand up performance I see bright things ahead for him.KEVIN HART: LET ME EXPLAIN begins somewhat different than most stand up comic performances. Instead we open at a party being held by Hart in celebration of his success. The problem is that now that he's successful he's found all the baggage that being there adds on. Slams for not being funny to not being all that he can be etc. lead to his shutting down the party and heading for Madison Square Garden so he can set the record straight. In all honesty it's an interesting premise to start with but goes too long, nearly 10 minutes of a 75 minute film.Hart arrives at the Garden and walks out to roaring applause and a humongous stage that has shooting flames, part of a joke he shares with the audience that he pops up now and then. It is here that he starts the stand up portion of the film and the start feels a bit rocky. The excitement that Hart feels is on display from the get go as he starts out with such a rapid fire delivery that by the time you get one joke he's already three past it. His delivery even sounds like he's gasping for breath before he can get out his next line.Eventually he slows down this delivery and begins to offer his take on life and more importantly the life that he is now leading. Hart is the type of comedian who gets his humor not from writing simple jokes that start out with a set up and end with a punch line. Hart tells stories that are funny. Some of the best comedians have done this in the past, most notably Bill Cosby. Hart has the potential to become as successful as Cosby with the way he delivers his stories and how they drag you in the longer they become.With only 60 minutes or less of material on display (the rest is the intro, applause and a heartfelt moment at the end) Hart gives you plenty to laugh at. No spoiler warning here as I don't intend to spoil any jokes he offers by sharing them. Just know to expect some truly funny tales. Also expect to find one thing that's always bothered me about young comedians which is the need to use the bluest of language. If Hart were employing a swear far at a quarter a pop just for his use of the F bomb you could feed a family of four at a nice restaurant. If this doesn't offend you then you'll never notice it.By the end there were two things that stood out for me with this performance film. The first was the potential that Hart shows. He really can be quite funny and not just in a film performance way but with his delivery and body language joined together to make something that will evoke laughs. The other thing was the heartfelt moment near the end when he walks back onstage to thank the audience for supporting him and for coming out to the show. As one of few comedians to sell out Madison Square Garden it brings him to tears of appreciation for his fans.
