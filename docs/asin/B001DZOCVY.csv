1184173,A2IX0O3HGLEWMT,B001DZOCVY,Dave,"[0, 1]","I was optimistic about this going in, Western type movies for me have been the go-to movie when I get tired of the same old sex, endless CGI, non-stop fighting sequence, safe the world movies and just want to be simply entertained. That being said, I don't usually have a lot of high expectations for westerns or period films, just aim for the middle of the road and go. So it doesn't take much to make me happy with these types of movies.There is one sure way to ruin any movie, bad acting and/or bad directing. This has both. The cure for bad acting is a good director, one that sees this,and corrects it. Immediately, or it will become like the plague and infect everyone. The acting is on par with watching 2nd grade school children in a play, unlike children where it's cute and fun to watch them because a) their little kids and b) because of their innocence, they actually don't care that they can't act. The actors in the film seem to not care or maybe it's because they have never acted before. Who knows. But because the director failed to do his job and fix this situation (or replace them), there is no real character development, there's also absolutely no chemistry between actors. So in the end, you just don't care. At all.The story has it's shortcomings, but with the right screenwriter, could have been pretty good.

1184181,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,B001DZOCVY,Leif Sheppard,"[4, 7]","My initial thoughts upon seeing the DVD cover, which is clearly titled DEAN TEASTER'S GHOST TOWN, was to think ""Who on earth is Dean Teaster?"" I'm an ardent fan of film (big-budget and independent) and I'd never heard of him. But if this is the best work he can produce, it's small wonder! It was my mistake, really, the scant plot description on the back of the DVD case should've been a red flag.The case simply declares ""Love, hate, family, forgiveness, redemption and sacrifice rock this small Western town. Family honor is defended while the gold rush surges forward."" You might have noticed that it's simply a mash of random terms that all vaguely apply to the film along with another sentence that succinctly outlines the story (which is as insipid as it sounds).Oh, where to begin? The opening credits elicited a chuckle at the hackneyed Native American imagery, replete with a woman cooly staring at the camera with the fog machine on overdrive. The old man's western accent is hilarious, as it seems he's affecting his best Walter Brennan impersonation. The opening jailbreak scene is about as exciting as watching a loved one being autopsied. This is because any intensity is derailed by wooden acting and bloody awful fight choreography (watch the jailer being assaulted on the ground, doesn't it seem like the gang is simply dancing a jig around him?). Mind you, these are moments from just the first ten minutes of this movie.As for the characters, this film hits every cliche firmly on the head, I have to give it points for not missing a single one. The kid being broken out of jail is the archetypal immature violent misfit, a hallmark of westerns since the genre began. The sheriff guy dies a predictably noble and violent end, though the gang very kindly helped him into a coffin before shooting him to death. How sweet of them!Did I mention the old man's accent is hilarious? Oh well, it bears another mention, I had to rewind a few times to hear his lines again. By the way, I could swear one of those indians at the final shootout has facepaint that resembled a clown. Comedy gold!If a film can deliver at least half of what's promised, I can meet it halfway, I can forgive quite a bit. With DEAN TEASTER'S GHOST TOWN, you'll only end up asking forgiveness from whomever you asked to watch it with you. Unless you're like me, in which case my friends and I got more (unintentional) laughs out of this film than most Hollywood comedies. So that's something, I guess.The bottom line is that the best reason to watch this film is to remind yourself just how great a well-crafted western such as UNFORGIVEN can be (which this film desperately wishes it could be).",1,"An Seemingly Earnest, Yet Ultimately Inept, Attempt",1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,2681,"['initial', 'thoughts', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'cover', 'clearly', 'titled', 'DEAN', 'TEASTER', 'GHOST', 'TOWN', 'was', 'think', 'Who', 'earth', 'Dean', 'Teaster', ""'m"", 'ardent', 'fan', 'film', 'big-budget', 'independent', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'best', 'work', 'can', 'produce', 'small', 'wonder', 'was', 'mistake', 'really', 'scant', 'plot', 'description', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'red', 'flag.The', 'case', 'simply', 'Love', 'hate', 'family', 'forgiveness', 'redemption', 'sacrifice', 'rock', 'small', 'Western', 'town', 'Family', 'honor', 'defended', 'gold', 'rush', 'forward', 'might', 'have', 'noticed', 'simply', 'mash', 'random', 'terms', 'vaguely', 'apply', 'film', 'sentence', 'succinctly', 'story', 'as', 'insipid', '.Oh', 'where', 'begin', 'opening', 'credits', 'elicited', 'chuckle', 'hackneyed', 'Native', 'American', 'imagery', 'replete', 'woman', 'cooly', 'staring', 'camera', 'fog', 'machine', 'overdrive', 'old', 'man', 'western', 'accent', 'hilarious', 'affecting', 'best', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'impersonation', 'opening', 'jailbreak', 'scene', 'as', 'exciting', 'watching', 'loved', 'one', 'being', 'autopsied', 'intensity', 'derailed', 'wooden', 'acting', 'bloody', 'awful', 'fight', 'choreography', 'watch', 'jailer', 'being', 'assaulted', 'ground', ""n't"", 'seem', 'gang', 'simply', 'dancing', 'jig', 'Mind', 'are', 'moments', 'just', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie.As', 'characters', 'film', 'cliche', 'firmly', 'head', 'have', 'give', 'points', 'not', 'missing', 'single', 'one', 'kid', 'being', 'broken', 'jail', 'archetypal', 'immature', 'violent', 'misfit', 'hallmark', 'westerns', 'genre', 'began', 'sheriff', 'guy', 'predictably', 'noble', 'violent', 'end', 'gang', 'very', 'kindly', 'helped', 'coffin', 'shooting', 'death', 'How', 'sweet', 'Did', 'mention', 'old', 'man', 'accent', 'hilarious', 'Oh', 'well', 'mention', 'had', 'rewind', 'few', 'times', 'hear', 'lines', 'again', 'way', 'could', 'swear', 'one', 'indians', 'final', 'shootout', 'facepaint', 'resembled', 'clown', 'Comedy', 'gold', 'film', 'can', 'deliver', 'least', 'half', 'what', 'promised', 'can', 'meet', 'halfway', 'can', 'forgive', 'quite', 'bit', 'DEAN', 'TEASTER', 'GHOST', 'TOWN', ""'ll"", 'only', 'end', 'up', 'asking', 'forgiveness', 'whomever', 'asked', 'watch', ""'re"", 'case', 'friends', 'got', 'more', 'unintentional', 'film', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'something', 'guess.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'best', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'remind', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'well-crafted', 'western', 'such', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'can', 'be', 'film', 'desperately', 'could', 'be']",Dean Teaster's Ghost Town 2007

Maggie Valley has an amusement park called Ghost Town in the Sky (i.e. a Western town on a mountain), which is where the film was made.The scenic beauty of this area was enough to pique my interest. In addition, the movie features the beautiful Renee O'Connor (Xena's sidekick, Gabrielle) in a small role with very few lines and Bill McKinney as the villain (he's always great for such a role; remember him as the perverted mountain man in ""Deliverance""?). Other positives include Princess Lucaj as Violet Teaster and DJ Perry as, Will Burnett, the good son of the villain (McKinney). Rance Howard is also on hand.This is low-budgeted independent film, of which I'm a fan (conventional blockbusters usually bore me). Unfortunately, ""Ghost Town"" is not a good movie despite the positives noted above, it's not even okay; in fact, it's nigh embarassingly bad. I wanted to quit watching after a mere 10-20 minutes but forced myself to endure to the end.
