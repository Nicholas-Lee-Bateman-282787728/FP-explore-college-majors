Mom""","[3, 6]","There was a point - original, madly creative, sometimes poignant and always amusing to Scrubs in previous seasons - alas; the deep well of comic mojo can definitely be diagnosed as having gone dry in the final season. Farewell - and so passes the glory that was. Mind you, there are still flashes of wit, and a collection of new med-school students floundering their way through relations personal, medical and scholastic  . . .  but it all seems perfunctory, as if they had just reworked scenes from old scripts. A handful of the old regulars, notably the irascible Dr. Cox and the former sidekick Turk (John C. McGinley and Donald Faison) are still hanging in, but in an enervated fashion, as if they are just going through the motions. Possibly the show might have been workable, if more of the new faces had been introduced and the old ones phased out gradually, but season 9 starts abruptly and then ends even more abruptly. It's as if the plug was pulled between one week and the next. It seems as if the show really ended very satisfactorily at the end of Season 8, but carried on with a few bitter-enders and then lost interest all together after half a season when it became apparent that the lightening could not be caught in the jar once more time.The extras are perfunctory - the funniest is about the golf cart.",1,End of the Line,1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,1324,"['was', 'point', 'original', 'madly', 'creative', 'sometimes', 'poignant', 'always', 'amusing', 'Scrubs', 'previous', 'seasons', 'alas', 'deep', 'well', 'comic', 'mojo', 'can', 'definitely', 'be', 'diagnosed', 'having', 'gone', 'dry', 'final', 'season', 'Farewell', 'so', 'glory', 'was', 'Mind', 'are', 'still', 'flashes', 'wit', 'collection', 'new', 'med-school', 'students', 'floundering', 'way', 'relations', 'personal', 'medical', 'scholastic', 'perfunctory', 'had', 'just', 'reworked', 'scenes', 'old', 'scripts', 'handful', 'old', 'regulars', 'notably', 'irascible', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'former', 'sidekick', 'Turk', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'are', 'still', 'hanging', 'enervated', 'fashion', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'Possibly', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'workable', 'more', 'new', 'had', 'been', 'introduced', 'old', 'ones', 'phased', 'out', 'gradually', 'season', '9', 'starts', 'abruptly', 'then', 'even', 'more', 'abruptly', 'plug', 'was', 'pulled', 'one', 'week', 'next', 'show', 'really', 'ended', 'very', 'satisfactorily', 'end', 'Season', '8', 'carried', 'few', 'bitter-enders', 'then', 'lost', 'interest', 'together', 'season', 'when', 'became', 'apparent', 'lightening', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'caught', 'jar', 'once', 'more', 'time.The', 'extras', 'are', 'perfunctory', 'funniest', 'golf', 'cart']",Scrubs: The Complete Ninth and Final Season

1296698,AIO247KHD2O40,B002WC89WK,James N Simpson,"[1, 3]","Sure this isn't the same show that was Scrubs.  Granted it hasn't been marketed that way and instead of being promoted a spin off show in the same vein which Frasier was from Cheers, CSI Miami from original CSI, or even Muppet Babies from the Muppet Show (as referred to in this show).  There in lies the major problem, but that's not this show it self's fault. Probably some penny pinchers in some TV board room wanting to milk as much money from advertisers that insisted on this being called Scrubs Ninth Season. Of course this link ultimately annoyed too many Scrubs fans who didn't watch and the show was axed before a second season (or tenth if you're including Scrubs seasons 1-8).Scrubs Med School, lets call it what it was supposed to be called, isn't the masterpiece show that Scrubs was, but it's still a good show in its own right.  When it comes down to it, after watching these 13 episodes would you watch another season?  Well I would, and that in my mind means this cast of new actors, did their job. I think there's areas both in casting and script where they could have done better, mostly though that's in clearly separating the two shows (which those same network board members might not have let happen).  The theme song should have been changed rather than a less good version of the original Lazlo Bane's Superman, and they should have gotten rid of hanging the x-ray.  With the opening credits it's also pretty obvious Zach Braff didn't allow his image to be used in episodes he wasn't paid to be in, as Lucy hangs the x-ray in those.  On Zach Braff, his character JD definitely made Scrubs what it was, and was one of the reasons it was so successful, but to be honest, he seems to have no purpose for being on this new show (at the university), his storyline doesn't flow from Season 8 when he left Sacred Heart to be near his kid. That kid is not even mentioned in this one, instead JD's knocked up Elliot and is also married to her, (we don't get to see or find out how any of that happened) This cheap giving into what fans might have wanted for their beloved characters was something writers didn't give into for the real Scrubs show so why do it now?  These new Scrubs episodes grew on me more when JD wasn't in them, as we could then concentrate on the newbie medical students lives and their stories.  JD doesn't have any arch nemesis in the Janitor (no Neil Finn) or Dr Cox (since they're now pretty much equals in this university as is Turk). So we're pretty much reduced to him doing double eagles and low substance stuff like this when he's on screen.  JD would have been better coming in after a few episodes simply visiting Turk or something, rather than writers trying to force his character into a role at the university.Also the new narrator (Lucy) being pretty much a hybrid between JD and Elliot's characters from Scrubs was a bit annoying not to mention lazy writing.  I also found the actress who played her's makeup covered mole on her upper lip cheek area to be a bit distracting, surely if she was in training to be a doctor she'd get an actual doctor colleague to remove it.On the plus side, the rich son of major financial contributor, Cole is an interesting and funny shallow self obsessed character.  Drew the repeat and so now mature age student with issues is a great addition to the show and better than any of the newbie characters that appeared in the last couple of Scrubs seasons. The other two study group members the hot Australian student and short Asian student never really reached their potential.  Denise the former and best newbie from season 8 is now a teacher doctor which doesn't really make sense that a trainee could reach these heights this quickly but she is one of the best characters in the new show so a great edition.  She's not as depressed or dark if you will as she was in Scrubs but she's still good entertainment value.  Either her or Drew should have been the narrator to differentiate this show from the JD narrated Scrubs.  Lucy just constantly reminds viewers that it's not Scrubs and brings comparisons.Maybe the show would have worked better if instead of just building a university on the old Sacred Hearts site, some rich patient whose life was saved could have simply employed Dr Cox, Dr Turk and Denise (maybe also Elliot if she left after a few episodes to have her baby or something) in thanks for saving his life. The cameos by Ted, Dr Kelso and others from the original Scrubs don't really work for being at the university and provide too many links to the old show.  They really needed to make a decision to make this a brand new show, too many attempts to try and win fans of Scrubs by simply having cameos by that shows actors probably ultimately confused to many people to if this was a spin off show or another season of Scrubs without all the characters.I enjoyed it though, as I said, if they made a second season with this cast I'd have watched it.  Disappointing extra features on the DVD also let this down such as Bill Lawrence appearing on a second TV screen while deleted scenes are playing on another talking the whole time so you can't hear what is being said in the deleted scenes.  There's not many bloopers and Live from The Golf Cart just had two minor characters (security guards) who weren't that good in the show interviewing the Todd about his new book.  Scrubbing In, is an interview with Bill Lawrence, Zach Braff and others about this season but again isn't too long.",4,"When it Comes Down to it, I'd Watch a Second Season of Scrubs Med

The writing shows that the original writers probably left too. While a lot of the original cast left as well, there's no Janitor(Neil Flynn), no Carla (Judy Reyes, no Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller) ""not as a regular anyway"" and the stuffed dog isn't even back. Hell J.D (Zach Braff) is only in the first few episodes and is suddenly gone, leaving Turk (Donald Faison) as the lead.The show was still funny, but the writing just got lazy. The new students were basically just clones of the originals, which is lame since some of the originals were still on the show. You have Travis Schuldt as Keith, who's just a version of Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley) and Kerry Bish&eacute; as Lucy Bennett, who's a woman version of J.D. She gets lost in her own imagination like he does and the show didn't need 2 people like that.Dave Franco is funny and annoying at the same time as Lucy's immature boyfriend Cole.

1296708,A1MZW5Z6RFSIZI,B002WC89WK,"Old School Gamer ""What the hell's a gigawatt!?!""","[4, 6]","I, unfortunately, was very late for the boat on this show. I only recently got to go through all 9 season of this show and it's become one of my absolute favirotes. Anyone who watched this show knows it was one of those rare shows that never really faultered in it's vision of itself. Season's 7 and 8 had a few weak moments, but this always happens when a show starts to introduce more characters that take away from the main cast so late into the lifespan of the show.My problem with this season is that it just isn't necessary in the first place. As I watched the apparent series finale in Season 8, I was filled with rare satisfaction in a shows closing moments. Often I'm let down and it never really reaches the height of what you want, but I think they did such a perfect job stating just enough about why and how these characters mattered to one another so much. The Cox/J.D. moment was perfect for instance. He said what we always wanted to hear him say but quickly recludes back into Coxian form as J.D. opens his mouth one final time. There is a final dilemma for J.D. and a new lesson even on his last day at a place he seems to have gotten almost everything out of it he could, proving his journey is only beginning. I mean, we know what the future holds for him, Turk, Eliot, Carla, etc etc etc and I was just happy to see it go out on a high note.Then came season 9. I'm not going to say I don't want more Scrubs because I, of course, do. I'm not going to say the character of the interns wasn't a good choice and that I wasn't interested in her, because she did the job. I will say this though. Someone mentioned Saved By The Bell: The New Class and this season felt just like to me. It was an attempt to find ""replacement"" characters to fill roles left empty when previous actors eitehr A) were committed to other things and unable to continue or B) the story itself wrecks the continuity so that these characters couldn't possibly make a return.To me, the choice of having the hospital get ""knocked down"" and placed on a college campus so that Turk, J.D. and Cox become teachers is just too coincedental. There is no mention of something like this ever potentially occuring, it would have to be a much less desirable position for every one of them who were head's of their departments at Sacred Heart, and it just feels too convenient. Likewise, the show was what it was because I cared about the characters established in season 1 all the way to their stories finale in season 8. This show isn't E.R. and was never a revolving door for stars to play doctors for a few seasons and then move on like a soap opera and that's what made it special. I never really wanted any of the new characters to become the focus, but they were being forced on me.I really wish they hadn't called this season 9 and had just deemed it something like Scrubs: Med School or something. Overall the laughs are still there but more sparse and they still come from the same cast members, ie Cox, J.D., and Turk. Beyond that, it's just a failed experiment. If you're someone new coming to the show, you can skip this season and still get all you need from seasons 1-8.",3,Scrubs should have stopped with season 8.,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,3161,"['unfortunately', 'was', 'very', 'late', 'boat', 'show', 'only', 'recently', 'got', 'go', '9', 'season', 'show', 'become', 'one', 'absolute', 'favirotes', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'never', 'really', 'faultered', 'vision', 'Season', '7', '8', 'had', 'few', 'weak', 'moments', 'always', 'when', 'show', 'introduce', 'more', 'characters', 'take', 'away', 'main', 'cast', 'so', 'late', 'lifespan', 'show.My', 'problem', 'season', 'just', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'first', 'place', 'watched', 'apparent', 'series', 'finale', 'Season', '8', 'was', 'filled', 'rare', 'satisfaction', 'shows', 'closing', 'moments', 'Often', ""'m"", 'let', 'down', 'never', 'really', 'height', 'what', 'want', 'think', 'did', 'perfect', 'job', 'stating', 'just', 'enough', 'why', 'how', 'characters', 'mattered', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'Cox/J.D', 'moment', 'was', 'perfect', 'instance', 'said', 'what', 'always', 'wanted', 'hear', 'say', 'quickly', 'recludes', 'back', 'Coxian', 'form', 'J.D', 'mouth', 'one', 'final', 'time', 'final', 'dilemma', 'J.D', 'new', 'lesson', 'even', 'last', 'day', 'place', 'have', 'gotten', 'almost', 'everything', 'could', 'proving', 'journey', 'only', 'beginning', 'mean', 'know', 'what', 'future', 'Turk', 'Eliot', 'Carla', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'was', 'just', 'happy', 'see', 'go', 'out', 'high', 'note.Then', 'came', 'season', '9', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'more', 'Scrubs', 'course', 'do', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'character', 'interns', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'choice', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'did', 'job', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'Someone', 'mentioned', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'New', 'Class', 'season', 'felt', 'just', 'was', 'attempt', 'find', 'replacement', 'characters', 'fill', 'roles', 'left', 'empty', 'when', 'previous', 'actors', 'eitehr', 'were', 'committed', 'other', 'things', 'unable', 'continue', 'B', 'story', 'continuity', 'so', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'make', 'return.To', 'choice', 'having', 'hospital', 'get', 'knocked', 'down', 'placed', 'college', 'campus', 'Turk', 'J.D', 'Cox', 'become', 'teachers', 'just', 'too', 'coincedental', 'mention', 'something', 'ever', 'potentially', 'occuring', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'desirable', 'position', 'one', 'who', 'were', 'head', ""'s"", 'departments', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'just', 'feels', 'too', 'convenient', 'Likewise', 'show', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'cared', 'characters', 'established', 'season', '1', 'way', 'stories', 'finale', 'season', '8', 'show', ""n't"", 'E.R', 'was', 'never', 'revolving', 'door', 'stars', 'play', 'doctors', 'few', 'seasons', 'then', 'move', 'soap', 'opera', 'what', 'made', 'special', 'never', 'really', 'wanted', 'new', 'characters', 'become', 'focus', 'were', 'being', 'forced', 'me.I', 'really', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'called', 'season', '9', 'had', 'just', 'deemed', 'something', 'Scrubs', 'Med', 'School', 'something', 'laughs', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'more', 'sparse', 'still', 'come', 'same', 'cast', 'members', 'ie', 'Cox', 'J.D.', 'Turk', 'Beyond', 'just', 'failed', 'experiment', ""'re"", 'someone', 'new', 'coming', 'show', 'can', 'skip', 'season', 'still', 'get', 'need', 'seasons', '1-8']",Scrubs: The Complete Ninth and Final Season
