958622,AAFVB4SGR3AC5,B000CFX4DS,"C. Sharifi ""CS""","[0, 0]","My youngest son has special needs & mainly uses sign language as a form of communication.  My son can learn all sorts of things from these videos that he was unable to learn in preshcool.  With just days of ""Meet the Numbers"" he knew several numbers and with 2 weeks of ""Meet the Letters"" he was able to name many letters on the cover of Meet the Numbers.  This is a big deal because just saying words clear enough for us to understand is hard yet he was able to say these things.  I even consider somewhat of a speech therapy while he does the video because he talks along with them.  With the simple & repetitive style it is very easy to pick up and they associate the characters with what they are leraning and are able to generatlize it into every day activities.  I HIGHLY recomend this item not only for normal children but for those with special needs.  We use our's in the car on the way to school.

958623,AWM7PWU2F7LRS,B000CFX4DS,Elizabeth,"[0, 0]","I love this tape. I actually have shapes, colors, number's and the letter's. It focuses on mainly on the basics. No added extras or distractions to keep the child mind from wandering or memorizing which you don't want. It only focuses on Shapes or Colors and etc.What I mean by that is when learning tapes have song or dance, the child becomes so focused on 'singing that song' or 'doing that dance' instead of learning and getting an understanding of what being shown. Now I'm not saying put your child in front of the tv and leave him. NO NO NO. What I'm saying is you want something a little extra to help boost what your teaching.For example I work at a home daycare. My class consist of 1 & 2 year old. After we go through the flash cards (remember they don't have a long attention span) so doing 2 out of the 4 areas four days of the week and switching up the process like Alphabet + colors or numbers + shapes (flash cards) and you keep switching. Which takes only about 10 minutes to do. Then let them have their play time. Now instead of turning on dora, team umizumi or yo gabba gabba. Play two of the Dvds. And when they see that what's on the tv and what they see on the flash cards they get it faster and better, than in song. And of all the learning tapes I have used these are more effective. And I only use these. The other tapes are decor for my shelf.Get involved with your kid learning stages. Don't let cartoons teach your kids. Cause the only thing their teaching your kid is to sing and dance. Instead of learning. Keep working with them. And by 3 years old their doing sight words and reading by 5 years old on a second grade level.

958625,A14NZ4QSH30E0U,B000CFX4DS,"Inga Goodwin ""Inga""","[1, 1]","I started playing this video when my baby was probably 6 months old everyday once a day.  At first as with all his videos, he would watch for a couple of minutes and then get bored.  But as he got used to it, he started paying attention more.  Eventually he had favorite parts that he would respond to.  For some reason Octagon really got him giggling, especially at the end when she's all alone with cricket sounds.A few weeks ago, when he was 15 months old, he was playing in a bin of shapes.  I casually said a shape, and he pulled it out.  I said another one, and he pulled that one out too.  I looked at my housekeeper and said, ""Is this just a coincidence?""  She replied, ""I think he really knows it.""  So, then I asked him to find the oval which was half covered, not holding my breath for anything.  Lo and behold, he sifted and found it!  I could not believe my eyes.  That was the very first time he responded to me quite positively that he knew some things.  Well, later I tested him when he was fed and happy in his high chair.  As I said them, he looked, smiled when he saw each one and then grabbed them.In this video, the only speech you hear is the narrator's voice or the characters' voices saying the shape name.  You derive the story line by watching the characters interact with their environments.  There is obviously friendly music in the background that go with each character.The circle skateboards.  The square builds a bird house.  The triangle sits in a canoe and feeds the ducks.  The oval makes popcorn.  The star gets on a ride at a place like Chuckey Cheese's and travels space and the ocean.  The octagon plays in the school playground.  The rectangle puts out a campfire as a fire truck.My baby still enjoys this video and has the biggest grin on his face when the circle comes out and tells the parents to adjust their tv screen if he looks stretched out.",5,My Baby Learned His Shapes,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1889,"['started', 'playing', 'video', 'when', 'baby', 'was', 'probably', '6', 'months', 'old', 'everyday', 'day', 'first', 'videos', 'would', 'watch', 'couple', 'minutes', 'then', 'get', 'bored', 'got', 'used', 'started', 'paying', 'attention', 'more', 'Eventually', 'had', 'favorite', 'parts', 'would', 'respond', 'reason', 'Octagon', 'really', 'got', 'giggling', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'alone', 'cricket', 'sounds.A', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'when', 'was', '15', 'months', 'old', 'was', 'playing', 'bin', 'shapes', 'casually', 'said', 'shape', 'pulled', 'out', 'said', 'one', 'pulled', 'one', 'too', 'looked', 'housekeeper', 'said', 'just', 'coincidence', 'replied', 'think', 'really', 'So', 'then', 'asked', 'find', 'oval', 'was', 'half', 'covered', 'not', 'holding', 'breath', 'anything', 'Lo', 'behold', 'sifted', 'found', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'eyes', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'responded', 'quite', 'positively', 'knew', 'things', 'Well', 'later', 'tested', 'when', 'was', 'fed', 'happy', 'high', 'chair', 'said', 'looked', 'smiled', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'then', 'grabbed', 'video', 'only', 'speech', 'hear', 'narrator', 'voice', 'characters', 'voices', 'saying', 'shape', 'name', 'derive', 'story', 'line', 'watching', 'characters', 'interact', 'environments', 'obviously', 'friendly', 'music', 'background', 'go', 'character.The', 'circle', 'skateboards', 'square', 'bird', 'house', 'triangle', 'canoe', 'ducks', 'oval', 'popcorn', 'star', 'ride', 'place', 'Chuckey', 'Cheese', 'travels', 'space', 'ocean', 'octagon', 'school', 'playground', 'rectangle', 'out', 'campfire', 'fire', 'truck.My', 'baby', 'still', 'video', 'biggest', 'grin', 'face', 'when', 'circle', 'out', 'parents', 'adjust', 'tv', 'screen', 'stretched', 'out']",Meet the Shapes
