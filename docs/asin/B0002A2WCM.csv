I enjoy Jennifer Garner's work as well and she was very good in this too.  It is surprising that this show wasn't picked up for another season.  Network's never know when they have a classic in the making.",5,Surprisingly good.,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,341,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'NCIS', 'was', 'Very', 'young', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'enjoy', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'surprising', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'picked', 'up', 'season', 'Network', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'have', 'classic', 'making']",N/A
829125,AY12DBB0U420B,B0002A2WCM,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I bought this ""Significant Others"" series off the bargain rack at a Ross Store. It has six episodes altogether on two discs (four episodes on one disc and two on a second), but I just couldn't sit through all of them. It's just not my kind of program and I regret buying it. The series has to do with 20-somethings coupling and uncoupling and trying to get established in a business/profession at the same time. The sets are OK and the acting isn't bad. Sorry, but I just can't take the stories. They just dwell on all the things that 20s do and all the problems that they have in doing them. I've been through my 20s fifty years ago and I wouldn't care to live through them again, and that's what you're doing in watching this series. It might be appropriate for a much younger person. To me, it's not very interesting nor is it very funny. In fact, I'd regard it as somewhat painful to watch. If you really want to wade through this stuff, I'd suggest getting the complete series discs rather than this abbreviated program.Gary Peterson",2,"Neither Very Interesting, Nor Very Funny.",1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,1038,"['bought', 'Significant', 'Others', 'series', 'bargain', 'rack', 'Ross', 'Store', 'six', 'episodes', 'altogether', 'two', 'discs', 'four', 'episodes', 'one', 'disc', 'two', 'second', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'sit', 'just', 'not', 'kind', 'program', 'regret', 'buying', 'series', 'do', '20-somethings', 'coupling', 'uncoupling', 'trying', 'get', 'established', 'business/profession', 'same', 'time', 'sets', 'are', 'OK', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Sorry', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'stories', 'just', 'dwell', 'things', '20s', 'do', 'problems', 'have', 'doing', ""'ve"", 'been', '20s', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'live', 'again', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'watching', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'appropriate', 'much', 'younger', 'person', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'very', 'funny', 'fact', ""'d"", 'regard', 'somewhat', 'painful', 'watch', 'really', 'want', 'wade', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'getting', 'complete', 'series', 'discs', 'rather', 'abbreviated', 'program.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

The same cannot be said for me. I first saw Jennifer Garner in 'Alias', and 'Daredevil', and then 'Felicity' and that made me buy 'Alias'. Then I saw this show available and thought I'd give it a try.There was not one admirable quality to be found in any of these characters or their lives. I couldn't get passed the pilot episode. I don't know how it could have ever been picked up. I'm not at all surprised three episodes got aired. It is a dreadful show. It doesn't matter what order you see the six episodes in, they are still in the same sorry predicament they were in to begin with.This is a truly insignificant show and I admire anyone who gets any enjoyment out of it. The only good thing I will say is the theme song seemed pretty catchy and the actors have gone on to better things. This series should never have seen the light of day. Television series must not come any worse then this. I wouldn't normally be this harsh on a television series but there are absolutely no others that deserve such a poor rating then 'Significant Others'.",1,Choose something other then this insignificant excuse for a TV show,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,1201,"['Condered', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'be', 'own', 'little', 'secret', ""'Significant"", 'Others', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'incredible', 'impact', 'life', 'lives', 'fans', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'first', 'saw', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', ""'Alias"", ""'Daredevil"", 'then', ""'Felicity"", 'made', 'buy', ""'Alias"", 'Then', 'saw', 'show', 'available', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try.There', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'admirable', 'quality', 'be', 'found', 'characters', 'lives', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'passed', 'pilot', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'picked', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'three', 'episodes', 'got', 'aired', 'dreadful', 'show', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'order', 'see', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'same', 'sorry', 'predicament', 'were', 'begin', 'with.This', 'truly', 'insignificant', 'show', 'admire', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyment', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'theme', 'song', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'catchy', 'actors', 'have', 'gone', 'better', 'things', 'series', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'Television', 'series', 'must', 'not', 'come', 'worse', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'be', 'harsh', 'television', 'series', 'are', 'absolutely', 'others', 'deserve', 'poor', 'rating', 'then', ""'Significant"", 'Others']",N/A
