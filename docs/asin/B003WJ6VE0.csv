As a parent it got me thinking abut how much time do I really spend with my children. when the movie ended I even wanted to go and wake them up and hold onto them and whisper ""I love you"" in their ears over and over again.""The Way Home"" has two meanings in this TRUE story. The first being little 2 year old Joe finding his way home and the second and most important is Randy finding his way back into his families life. Before Joe went missing Randy was always busy with his work, even a few minutes before his little boy disappeared he was focused on work rather then getting his family ready for their vacation.I was also moved by the faith and support shown in the movie. My church the past year has been talking about ""family loving deeply"" and the Christian community (and the town) truly showed what it means to be a family loving deeply. Perfect strangers were showing up to pray and to search for Joe. Prayer chains were growing like crazy all over the US.I would recommend this movie to all families, you will be deeply moved by this story and I would hope you would find the love of Christ through it and that your perspective on your family will change to become a deeper connection with each other.------------------------*Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

So when BookSneeze offered me the chance to review his latest movie, I jumped at the chance!Cain plays Randy Simpkins, a man whose two-year-old son Joe disappeared while he was supposed to be watching him. When those in the community learn Randy's son is missing, they turn out in droves to help search for Joe.I wanted to like this movie. Instead, I just feel ambivalent about it. It was fine; the acting was good, the plot featured plenty of action, and the display of community is one we don't often see in this age of technology and privacy. But it was lacking ... something. At first, I thought perhaps the problem was that I already knew the ending--it's a true story, and it's not hard to guess what happens. But that's not it; I've thoroughly enjoyed many true-story movies where I already knew the ending. In the end, all I can say is this: The Way Home is a nice, well-produced film that's safe for the whole family. But it's probably not a movie you'll watch over and over again.I received this dvd free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their BookSneeze book review blogger program.

Filled with many tense, emotional scenes, this movie told a story unlike any I've ever heard.Staring in this new movie is Dean Cain as Randy Simpkins - a hardworking husband and father who spends a little too much time at the office instead of with his family. Marriage with his wife Cristal, is strained at the opening of the movie, when the family is preparing to go on what Cristal considers a ""much needed vacation"". Stressed after a brief argument with his wife, Randy watches his son at his wife's request as he finishes loading the car. Determined to check his email ""just one more time"", he sneaks inside. When he returns - Joe has disappeared.The movie continued along at a good pace, and never lagged - which surprised me, as thought a 90 minute movie about a lost son would be dragged out. It wasn't, and I really enjoyed the `ripple' effect that the son's disappearance had: people from all over showed up to search the Simpkins vast land. I was really touched and encouraged by this strong show of Christian love for the brethren.The only thing I did not like in the movie was the constant moving of the camera. I know it's popular in many films today, but it almost gives me a headache, trying to concentrate on one thing as it continues to move about. But - maybe that's just me!Besides this point, I enjoyed the movie and couldn't help but smile towards the end as God showed His goodness to the Simpkins family.

As they join with their family and community to search for their son, they learn valuable lessons about priorities, and they experience God's presence in their lives.  As they face the potential tragedy of losing their son forever, Randy and Crystal, the parents of missing two-year old Joe, are comforted by the love of the faith community surrounding them.  Randy, a somewhat absent father , commits to making God and family come first.  I couldn't tell for sure, but because of several references at the end of the film, I believe this was based on a true story.Unfortunately, most independent, Christian-produced films I have seen are not very well-done.  This was no exception.  I appreciate the story.  But, I thought the acting was poorly done and the spiritual scenes seemed forced.  This seems to be a common theme in Christian films that I have seen.  The acting seems stuttering, not flowing, and any scenes that involve a spiritual awakening in the life of a character seem forced.Perhaps, I am just too critical.  Perhaps I've seen the results of too many Hollywood films with a huge budget and unlimited acting talent.  But, I just wish for some better quality in Christian-produced films.  I greatly appreciate what the producers are trying to do.  I am thankful for a movie that is good and clean and not afraid to talk openly about the work of God in the personal lives of people.  I just wish the quality was good enough to appeal to a larger audience.I received a  free copy of this film for review purposes.

Not knowing if their son had been kidnapped, had fallen into one of the many wells, ponds, or swamp areas around them, he and his wife become frantic, and are met with a massive outpouring of support and help from their community.This is not a movie with a lot of action, but it is very moving and emotional. Maybe I shouldn't admit it, but I should have kept a tissue or two nearby while watching - so be forewarned.This is definitely a Christian movie, no holds barred, but it is not tacky or cheesy as too many Christian movies tend to be.

Joe is put on numerous prayer chains and people all over the small town pray for him to be found unharmed. People in droves turn up at the parents' home to help search for the boy and provide the family with prayer, comfort, and support. A man, who lost his own brother (also named Joe) years ago to a car accident shows up with his son to join in the search and we discover the pain in his heart at losing someone he loves. He doesn't want the Simkins family to know that same pain. Although he is recovering from a serious illness, this man sacrifices his time and energy to join in the search.This movie is based on a true story and what I liked most was the interviews with the real Simkins family at the end of the movie. It was well done, a touching tearjerker, and a testimony for the power of prayer and what can happen when we lift each other's needs up to the Lord.

Too often we fail in our attempts because companies simply aren't gearing that kind of movie any longer, yet I have come across some greats lately with my latest, The Way Home that I received compliments of Thomas Nelson to review.The movie based on a true story is about a man named Randy Simpkins, (played by Dean Cain from The New Adventures of Superman) who is like your typical family man. He spends countless hours trying to make enough so that his wife Cristal can stay at home and take care of raising their three boys. However lately Randy has been working way too much and neglecting his number one priority, his family.When Cristal makes plans to take the family away on a much needed vacation to the beach, she has to call Randy at work and tell him to come home. He had promised her he wasn't even going to go into work that day and now he is late coming home. Meanwhile, the responsibility has fallen on her shoulders to load up the family van while taking care of her youngest Joe, whose two.When Randy finally makes it home, Cristal is in the final stages of being packed and ready to leave, but needs to make a final check through the house. She asks Randy to take the last two bags by the front door and load them into the van, and make sure to put Joe in his car seat.Randy and Joe have a confrontation when Joe refuses to get in the van insisting that he wants to go to his Pa-Pa's house instead on his tricycle. While Joe tells him to stay by the van while he grabs the last of the bags and head inside, Joe promises to stay close. However when Randy gets the last minute impulse to check his work email before leaving, he is caught by his wife. They both grab their stuff and head outside, where Joe is now missing. Thinking he is doing nothing more than playing hide and seek, the parents spread out and begin the search. However after 30 minutes, it seems like something more has happened and the real search for Joe begins.This movie has a great message behind it all as Randy gets an opportunity to see what life without his family would be like before it's too late and comes with a great recommendation from me as a must see movie. I would easily rate this movie a 5 out of 5 stars because in today's world where we find ourselves so busy, its easy to lose sight of what really matters most.

But where?  As a workaholic, Randy is often busy, and his wife is sick of t, and fully blames Randy for Joe's disappearance!!When the Simpkins pastor puts out a prayer chain the entire community pulls together to look for the little boy.  The community unites in prayer, love and searching.My Thoughts:  Wow, an emotional powerful movie!!  The producers did a fabulous job of showing the gaumant of emotions that the parents would be feeling, and all of the friends/family and how they would also feel.  I also gained more appreciation for the technical trials of searching for someone, and the complications and procedures that would need to be followed.  It had enough details to make it feel accurate (movie based on a true story), but not so much that it was bogged down.This movie is a clean movie, and safe for the whole family if mom and dad are willing to answer questions.  *note, I always recommend pre-watching all movies, but especially with this one, you want to know if you really want the questions (I won't personally be letting our little people watch it yet).

1369337,A10UPYF30K74H0,B003WJ6VE0,"Trinity Rose ""book lover""","[1, 1]","The Way Home starring Dean Cain, is a Christian movie by Lionsgate Productions and is the best movie I've seen this year. One reason I love it so much is it is a true story. Randy, Christal and family were just about ready to go on vacation. While getting things into the van, their 2 year old son Joe disappeared.The 91 minute movie tells of the search and how everyone came together to help. Many churches formed prayer chains and came out to search. Randy is forced to deal with his life and priorities, while his faith is tested, and his marriage is close to falling apart. It shows how the searchers (police, fire etc..) work together and have a big job.The actors/actresses in this movie are fantastic. A lot of Christian movies can't say this. Only because they can't afford more well known actors. It held my three youngest children's and my attention and no one wanted to miss a single minute. Many times during the movie I was moved to tears. The emotions run high in this movie. The Way Home has the Dove Family Approved seal.The part of Ed searching for Joe, was really special. Many years ago Ed lost his brother in a car accident and his name was Joe. So even through Ed had heart surgery just a few months ago he still felt he needed to search. He just had to help so someone else didn't lose someone they loved. It was such a very, very touching part when Ed found Joe.If you have or did have younger children it will give you an appreciation for their safety. At the end of the movie during the credits it shows the real Joe as he has looked over the years and has grown.In special features the real Randy and Christal tell the story in their own words. It's just amazing to hear their story and see how close it is to the movie. It is touching at how much this has changed Randy. His heart is tender and full of love for the Lord.I know I've told you a lot about the movie, but it is so good it just needed to be told. If you don't buy any other DVD this year buy The Way Home. I love, love, love this movie. I highly recommend this movie.""Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of theproducts or services mentioned above for free in the hope that Iwould mention it on my blog.
