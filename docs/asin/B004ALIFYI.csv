KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[2, 2]","'Billy Gardell' Halftime is one of those rare stand up routines that maintains a certain level of hilarity throughout. Where many comedians seem to have high peaks  combined with long drawn out bits used as filler in the middle of their acts, Gardell remains consistent and keeps this excellent set running on all cylinders.
