845972,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B0002V7TB0,Andrew Raker,"[21, 25]","The Hallmark version of Mark Twain's classic, ""The Prince and the Pauper"" fails to tell major parts of the story. The acting is very childish, and the many of the characters fail to act their parts.Many scenes are poorly shot, and there are many chapters of the book left out (ex: the ""foo-foo, king of the moon calves"" scene, the whole character of the priest who teaches Tom to read Latin, and the test to determine the true king at the end of the film).In addition, the wardrobe is aweful. There is really no showing of actual poverty in this film. In the beginning of the film, Tom is wearing a decent set of clothing with shoes. In this time period, if a youth of age twelve was dressed as Tom was, he would not have been considered poor by any means. In addition, Tom speaks like an educated American rather than a poor English youth. Also, Tom's grandmother is a kind, gentle lady quite unlike her portrayal in the novel, where she and her son (i.e. Tom's father) beat Tom, his mother, and sisters. In fact, there is no beating at all in this film. It is more a fairy tale than social film.In short, I believe this film (if rated) would receive a ""G"" rating. There is no swearing, no real violence, so social crisis, etc. While I realize that teachers have few options for their classes as for COLORED versions of this films to watch, I would recommend the Disney VHS version of the film - ASIN: B000E78DGC. In fact, I really hope Disney eventually releases this 1962 version of the film (starring Guy Williams) on DVD. For the Disney version of the Prince and the Pauper is quite accurate concerning the poverty of Tom Canty and the splendor of the Tudor family.",2,Not a loyal adaptation....,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,1670,"['Hallmark', 'version', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'classic', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'tell', 'major', 'parts', 'story', 'acting', 'very', 'childish', 'many', 'characters', 'fail', 'act', 'parts.Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'poorly', 'shot', 'are', 'many', 'chapters', 'book', 'left', 'out', 'ex', 'foo-foo', 'king', 'moon', 'calves', 'scene', 'whole', 'character', 'priest', 'who', 'Tom', 'read', 'Latin', 'test', 'determine', 'true', 'king', 'end', 'film', '.In', 'addition', 'wardrobe', 'aweful', 'really', 'showing', 'actual', 'poverty', 'film', 'beginning', 'film', 'Tom', 'wearing', 'decent', 'set', 'clothing', 'shoes', 'time', 'period', 'youth', 'age', 'twelve', 'was', 'dressed', 'Tom', 'was', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'poor', 'means', 'addition', 'Tom', 'educated', 'American', 'rather', 'poor', 'English', 'youth', 'Also', 'Tom', 'grandmother', 'kind', 'gentle', 'lady', 'quite', 'portrayal', 'novel', 'where', 'son', 'i.e', 'Tom', 'father', 'beat', 'Tom', 'mother', 'sisters', 'fact', 'beating', 'film', 'more', 'fairy', 'tale', 'social', 'film.In', 'short', 'believe', 'film', 'rated', 'would', 'receive', 'G', 'rating', 'swearing', 'real', 'violence', 'so', 'social', 'crisis', 'etc', 'realize', 'teachers', 'have', 'few', 'options', 'classes', 'COLORED', 'versions', 'films', 'watch', 'would', 'recommend', 'Disney', 'VHS', 'version', 'film', 'ASIN', 'B000E78DGC', 'fact', 'really', 'hope', 'Disney', 'eventually', '1962', 'version', 'film', 'starring', 'Guy', 'Williams', 'DVD', 'Disney', 'version', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'quite', 'accurate', 'concerning', 'poverty', 'Tom', 'Canty', 'splendor', 'Tudor', 'family']",N/A

""the Errol Flynn version"") is quite good, but the ending was boggled by the introduction of an unnecessary and unhelpful delaying action, which was then made worse by being repeated (!), dispelling the high tension of the climactic end.  The twins who played the lead were very appealing but were made to speak in a very phony (sickeningly sweet) way.  There are also technical limitations, such as the sound quality.  I'd give it 4 stars.The 1978 version with an all-star cast had much going for it.  The big stars all played their roles well, but the movie was ruined by using a 20 year-old boy to play the 12 year-old Prince.  And he was repellant as well.  Also, the ""rollicking"" scenes went on a bit too long and too often.  I'd give it 3 stars.Fortunately (and for a change), the screenwriters learned from these past versions and this version is flawless.  The story rolled smoothly, not too fast, not slow, without repetitions or unnecessary delays or needless complications.  The twins who played the lead were appealing and played their parts well.  All of the cast were good.  The color, the photography, the music, the sound--all good.  The ending was just right.  This version also added a coda in which the Prince of Wales kept his various promises made to the several poor people who had been kind to him.Bottom line: Don't miss it.  Also, the whole family can enjoy this one.",5,the best movie version,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1559,"['am', 'happy', 'report', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'other', 'movie', 'versions', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'very', 'good', 'movie.The', '1937', 'version', 'a.k.a', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'version', 'quite', 'good', 'ending', 'was', 'boggled', 'introduction', 'unnecessary', 'unhelpful', 'delaying', 'action', 'was', 'then', 'made', 'worse', 'being', 'repeated', 'dispelling', 'high', 'tension', 'climactic', 'end', 'twins', 'who', 'played', 'lead', 'were', 'very', 'appealing', 'were', 'made', 'speak', 'very', 'phony', 'sickeningly', 'sweet', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'technical', 'limitations', 'such', 'sound', 'quality', ""'d"", 'give', '4', 'stars.The', '1978', 'version', 'all-star', 'cast', 'had', 'much', 'going', 'big', 'stars', 'played', 'roles', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'ruined', 'using', '20', 'year-old', 'boy', 'play', '12', 'year-old', 'Prince', 'was', 'repellant', 'well', 'Also', 'rollicking', 'scenes', 'went', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'often', ""'d"", 'give', '3', 'stars.Fortunately', 'change', 'screenwriters', 'learned', 'past', 'versions', 'version', 'flawless', 'story', 'rolled', 'smoothly', 'not', 'too', 'fast', 'not', 'slow', 'repetitions', 'unnecessary', 'delays', 'needless', 'complications', 'twins', 'who', 'played', 'lead', 'were', 'appealing', 'played', 'parts', 'well', 'cast', 'were', 'good', 'color', 'photography', 'music', 'sound', 'good', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'version', 'also', 'added', 'coda', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'kept', 'various', 'promises', 'made', 'several', 'poor', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'kind', 'him.Bottom', 'line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Also', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'one']",N/A

Cripe ""cooncat3""","[37, 41]","If you are looking for a good adventure movie to watch with your family, this one definitely rates five stars.If, however, you have read the original novel and have great respect for the writing of Mark Twain, you will hate this movie. Several reviewers have rated this version as the best of all the P&P; movies. If this one is the best, I don't even want to think about the others.On the plus side, the movie is, as stated, a good adventure family-type movie. It gives a vivid portrayal of medieval England, both the pomp and the grunge. It has plenty of action, fun, pathos, and a happy ending but also deals with the brutality, intolerance and political scheming of the age. The twins who play Prince Edward and Tom Canty are very good -- much more honestly expressive and far less hammy than most of the adult actors. They are attractive and personable without, thank God, being just-too-cute-for-words kid actors.Now for the axe. I do not and never will understand why people who adapt books for movies think that they are better writers than the original authors and can take whatever liberties they like with the plots and story lines. I do understand that it is almost impossible to film a book without leaving out many details and even characters and I can tolerate that. What I cannot tolerate, however, is the outright changing and destroying of as much of the original story as these screenwriters have done, not only weakening it but making certain situations absurd as well as inaccurate. Thus this movie is simply not Mark Twain's imaginative, sometimes biting and brutally frank, often hilarious statement for social justice.So -- by all means buy the movie or rent it if you want an evening of family entertainment. But avoid it like the plague if you are looking for an adjunct to the reading/study of Mark Twain's wonderful novel.",3,"Good Movie, But It's Not Mark Twain",1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,1850,"['are', 'looking', 'good', 'adventure', 'movie', 'watch', 'family', 'one', 'definitely', 'rates', 'five', 'stars.If', 'however', 'have', 'read', 'original', 'novel', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'writing', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'will', 'hate', 'movie', 'Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'rated', 'version', 'best', 'P', 'P', 'movies', 'one', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'think', 'others.On', 'plus', 'side', 'movie', 'stated', 'good', 'adventure', 'family-type', 'movie', 'vivid', 'portrayal', 'medieval', 'England', 'pomp', 'grunge', 'plenty', 'action', 'fun', 'pathos', 'happy', 'ending', 'also', 'deals', 'brutality', 'intolerance', 'political', 'scheming', 'age', 'twins', 'who', 'play', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Tom', 'Canty', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'much', 'more', 'honestly', 'expressive', 'far', 'less', 'hammy', 'most', 'adult', 'actors', 'are', 'attractive', 'personable', 'thank', 'God', 'being', 'just-too-cute-for-words', 'kid', 'actors.Now', 'axe', 'do', 'not', 'never', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'who', 'adapt', 'books', 'movies', 'think', 'are', 'better', 'writers', 'original', 'authors', 'can', 'take', 'liberties', 'like', 'plots', 'story', 'lines', 'do', 'understand', 'almost', 'impossible', 'film', 'book', 'leaving', 'out', 'many', 'details', 'even', 'characters', 'can', 'tolerate', 'What', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'however', 'outright', 'changing', 'destroying', 'as', 'much', 'original', 'story', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'done', 'not', 'only', 'weakening', 'making', 'certain', 'situations', 'absurd', 'as', 'well', 'inaccurate', 'Thus', 'movie', 'simply', 'not', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'imaginative', 'sometimes', 'biting', 'brutally', 'frank', 'often', 'hilarious', 'statement', 'social', 'justice.So', 'means', 'buy', 'movie', 'rent', 'want', 'evening', 'family', 'entertainment', 'avoid', 'plague', 'are', 'looking', 'adjunct', 'reading/study', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'wonderful', 'novel']",N/A
