751505,A13M4580KA6B9Q,B000093NR3,B. McCoy,"[3, 5]","Sondheim's score for Passion is one of the most musically complex in recent musical theater.  The mixing of major and minor keys -- depending on who is singing at the time -- is not really innovative, but the complexity and transitions between the keys as different characters take up different phrases in the songs is outstandingly done.The lyrics aren't as clever as in other of Sondheim's shows, but they convey the various emotional states beautifully.  The book by Levine is well put together, with no obvious flaws.Of the cast, Donna Murphy easily deserved her Tony award for the role of Fosca.  Her treatment of the character moving from appreciation to obsession to more tender loving of Georgio is remarkable, and her deep singing voice is a perfect complement to the music.  The supporting characters are also fairly strong.However, Jere Shea as Georgio is a case of bad casting.  His expression -- as well as his acting -- are wooden, and he is obviously not up to the task of expressing the range of emotions necessary for the character.  All that can be said in his credit is that he physically fits the part -- a man who would be considered attractive in Italy in the mid 1800s.  Vocally, he has a competent voice, but, again, lacks emotional expression.Marin Mazzie gives a competent performance.  While her voice is easily up to the demands of the score, her facial expressions as she sings are distracting.  How can a person who is grimacing as much as she does in the opening number be belivable when she sings about &quot;all this happiness?&quot;All said and done, the score, book, direction, and female lead all complement each other wonderfully.  However, the male lead and his paramour let the show down and prevent a &quot;5 star&quot; rating.",4,"Music is incredible, acting is sometimes wooden",1060732800,"08 13, 2003",2003,1767,"['Sondheim', 'score', 'Passion', 'one', 'most', 'musically', 'complex', 'recent', 'musical', 'theater', 'mixing', 'major', 'minor', 'keys', 'depending', 'who', 'singing', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'innovative', 'complexity', 'transitions', 'keys', 'different', 'characters', 'take', 'up', 'different', 'phrases', 'songs', 'outstandingly', 'done.The', 'lyrics', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'clever', 'other', 'Sondheim', 'shows', 'convey', 'various', 'emotional', 'states', 'beautifully', 'book', 'Levine', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'obvious', 'cast', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'easily', 'deserved', 'Tony', 'award', 'role', 'Fosca', 'treatment', 'character', 'moving', 'appreciation', 'obsession', 'more', 'tender', 'loving', 'Georgio', 'remarkable', 'deep', 'singing', 'voice', 'perfect', 'complement', 'music', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'fairly', 'strong.However', 'Jere', 'Shea', 'Georgio', 'case', 'bad', 'casting', 'expression', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'are', 'wooden', 'obviously', 'not', 'task', 'expressing', 'range', 'emotions', 'necessary', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'credit', 'physically', 'part', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'attractive', 'Italy', 'mid', '1800s', 'Vocally', 'competent', 'voice', 'again', 'emotional', 'expression.Marin', 'Mazzie', 'competent', 'performance', 'voice', 'easily', 'up', 'demands', 'score', 'facial', 'expressions', 'sings', 'are', 'distracting', 'How', 'can', 'person', 'who', 'grimacing', 'as', 'much', 'opening', 'number', 'be', 'belivable', 'when', 'quot', 'happiness', 'quot', 'All', 'said', 'done', 'score', 'book', 'direction', 'female', 'lead', 'complement', 'other', 'wonderfully', 'However', 'male', 'lead', 'paramour', 'let', 'show', 'down', 'prevent', 'quot', '5', 'star', 'quot', 'rating']",N/A

I must first say that I was not familiar with the more recent Sondheim works, and on first viewing I found some of the melody inaccessable / difficult - but only on first viewing.My main reason for the purchase was the chance to see Marin Mazzie in her role. I had heard her clear, lovely voice on radio, and so I thought it was fair to gamble on the higher than average purchase price. This production was filmed for PBS shortly after the Broadway run of the show closed, and all of the principle cast are captured here. Marin, along with Donna Murphy and Jere Shea have all earned a place in my heart - they truely and deeply touched me.The consequences of filming the staged presentation are that, in order to preserve the flow of the presentation, several cameras were used, and this resulted in an abundance of narrowly framed sequences and claustrophobic compositions. This is not entirely inappropriate given the subject matter. It was not possible to pull back for full vista views of the stage without revealing other cameras. The company comments on this in a lively and humourous commentary track.The music, the voices, are uniformly glorious. After I identified the themes associated with the principle characters, and after I understood their intertwining magic, I succumbed (like Fosca?)to the rhapsody. This is more than a DVD.

Yes, the seamless transition from song to speech and back again proves surprisingly effective and engrossing.  All of these are compelling reasons to buy this DVD.But the biggest and best reason for buying this DVD can be summed up in two words:  Donna Murphy.  Oh my God, her Fosca is unbelievable!!!  Her Tony-winning performance is unforgetable and will stick with you for weeks (maybe even months) after you first see it.  I have never been so moved by a character in a musical before.  She had me near tears, and I hardly ever cry while watching a show.  I cannot begin to put into words the kind of depth Murphy brings to the tortured soul of Fosca, the longing for acceptance, the rudeness, and yet the unbridled love that Murphy layers into her performance.  She steals ever scene she's in, and if the show had her on stage constantly for its almost two hours you wouldn't hear me complain.  In fact, the notes of the insert have book writer James Lapine reminded everyone that the show is actually about Gregio, not Fosca, showing just how much attention Murphy must have gotten.  I didn't really follow theatre back in 1994 when the show opened, but I imagine Murphy was the talk of the season and she deserved every compliment paid her and more.  Her Fosca is a master class in acting, not just for musical theatre but for all theatre, and I can only sit in awe of her.

I wore out my VHS copy sometime in the late 1990s. I have an original print of the CD. I've heard stories that copies of the CD went on eBay for upwards of $100. Now, within the span of a year, the CD was rereleased, and the film was transferred onto a fantastic DVD, which all Sondheimite's should own.""Passion"" tells a devestating story: Giorgio (Jere Shea), an Italian soldier in the mid 1800s, is transferred from Milan to a small provincial town, leaving behind his married lover, Clara (Marin Mazzie). When he reaches the town, he meets Fosca (the absolutely unbelievable Donna Murphy, in the best musical theatre performance of the latter half of the 20th century), the sickly and ugly cousin of his superior (Gregg Edelmann). She falls instantly in love with him, but he wants only to be friends. His heart belongs to Clara, who will never leave her husband. What follows is one of the most beautiful scores in recent memory, and Sondheim's most accomplished score to date.Mr. Shea is terrific as Giorgio, and Ms. Mazzie knocks it out of the ballpark as Clara. In smaller roles, Mr. Edelmann, Tom Aldredge, and Linda Balgord also shine.On October 20, 2004, at the Ambassador Theatre in NYC, ""Passion"" was reproduced for one night only. Ms. Murphy and Ms. Mazzie reprised their roles, and the excellent Michael Cerveris, who starred in the Kennedy Center production in 2002, played Giorgio. It was magical.

751512,A1R98YOH1ZQIGJ,B000093NR3,"Jordango ""Civili""","[10, 10]","I have had the recording of Stephen Sondheim's Passion for quite some time now. I love Sondheim, but I never could really get into the music very much. The notes and tempos are extremely irregular and are veyr hard to remember, so it seems you are hearing it for the first time every time you listen to it. But then I saw this DVD and I realized the brilliance of the music and the show itself. It plays perfectly into the story. I shouldn't be able to remember the music very well, I shouldn't think it is light and fluffy. It's not at all. My God, this show tore me apart when I saw this. I had no idea how wonderful it was. It is a perfect example of how actors are not just voices, they are people who bring these characters to life. Sondheim's lyrics and James Lapine's book are exquisite and work so well together, you'd think they were written by the same person. The music flows in such a way I would have never imagined listening to the recording.Donna Murphy! She brings one of the most brilliant performances to the stage that I have seen in years. She tore me up inside, made me cry, made me laugh even. I couldn't bear to watch yet she entangled me and made me watch. She's also got an amazing voice to match. I am absolutely in love with her now. Jere Shea is also very good. His voice is pure and melodic and perfect. His acting is very good too, I was surprised. Marin Mazzie is also perfectly convincing as the woman who loves her torrent afair yet wouldn't sacrifice a thing for it. Again, a beautiful voice.This show is also very clever is its staging. The soldiers entrances are always a treat to see. Just the way everything worked together in the show as one is something rarely seen. In this show, something hit home with me and with others I have talked to. Unconditional love, without pretense, without care of sacrifice, true passion is what is shown. Think Shakespeare in Love: if he had written this play instead to show the true nature of love, he would have most difinitively won the bet.

751513,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000093NR3,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 10]","In making a filmed version of their Tony Award winning musical ""Passion,"" Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine end up solving one of the main problems of enjoying the show.  The camera provides the requisite sense of intimacy that makes this story a more powerful experience because we are spared the distance of watching it from the seats.  ""Passion"" does not have scenes of spectacle that fill the stage.  It opens with two lovers in bed, singing directly into each other's faces, and that scene establishes the template for the best moments in the rest of the show.The story comes from Ettore Scola's 1981 film, ""Passione d'amore,"" which is based on the novel ""Fosca"" by Iginio Ugo Tarchetti, which Sondheim saw in 1983 and felt compelled to turn into a musical.  Giorgio (Jere Shea), is a handsome young captain in the Italian army who is having an affair with the beautiful but married Clara (Marin Mazzie).  He is then stationed far away from his love, but the two continue to communicate by letters (there are a lot of epistletory songs in ""Passion"").  There he meets Fosca (Donna Murphy,) the cousin of commanding officer.  She is a homely, sickly woman, who has never been been taught how to love, but she falls completely for the young captain.  Giorgio refuses her advances and tries to escape her attentions, bluntly telling Fosca that he will never return her feelings.  But in the face of her undeniable passion, he finds that his heart and his mind are changing.I had owned the CD of ""Passion"" since the musical first opened on Broadway because if Stephen Sondheim wants to write a musical I want to listen to it.  I consider his ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" to be his masterpiece, and just listening to ""Passion"" it is clear that this musical is not that musical.  To repeat the recurring criticism of some of Sondheim's work, that there is nothing for the audience to hum on their way out of the theater, might be inelegant and decidedly unoriginal but it is on point.  Listening to the CD made little impression on me, but the same cannot be said for watching this DVD.  Again, the experience is much better than it would be watching the show live, because when the camera comes up on these characters in close ups and two shots, its makes the story and the music much more powerful.The performances by the two female leads are superb, and Shea's performance suffers a bit in comparison (not his singing, but his rather wooden acting), but that does not really matter.  ""Passion"" is about ""love,"" and not just any type of love, but ""Love that thinks everything is pure, everything is beautiful, everything is possible...""

751514,A1SMNK99BI7WTE,B000093NR3,"Mark Andrew Lawrence ""Theatre Reviewer""","[8, 8]","The mixed reviews the VHS tape (and soon DVD) of PASSION are understandable.  One person commented the show was &quot;slow and boring.&quot;  While it is true that it is very European in style and yes, at times, it does try your patience.  But ... stay with it to the end and you will succumb in much the same way the leading man does to Fosca's passion.The music weaves together in a tapestry rich in melody and emotion.  No, these are not simplistic tunes in the Andrew Lloyd Webber vein.  Sondheim is not a songwriter: He is a trained and intelligent composer who draws references from Stravinsky, Ravel, Gershwin, and the Russian masters. He knows where to use melody and - more importantly - when to make the music more angular: Fosca's aria &quot;I Read&quot; would be a good example of this.Not everyone will respond to this show: Even on Broadway people laughed at inappropriate moments and found the story hard to believe.  Those looking for Disney-styled glitz and musical comedy tap dancers would be deeply disappointed.  PASSION is not a musical comedy.  The label that most often comes up in relation to PASSION is a &quot;chamber opera&quot; and perhaps it does belong in an intimate opera house instead of on Broadway next to CATS and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.In the 2002 Sondheim celebration at the Kennedy Center in Washington, PASSION was easily the best of the six productions offered and yet it was the slowest selling show and while many audience members gave it a standing ovation, others sat in stoney silence.No matter what your initial reaction to the material may be, you will no doubt find yourself think more about PASSION than other &quot;lighter&quot; entertainments.  The charcter of Fosca will haunt you long after the play has ended as will the music.  You will find yourself returning for a second and third look (and listen) and with each viewing you will appreciate the many layers in James LaPine's spare script and the subtle perfomances by each of the cast members.The film preserves the show's intimate staging though at times I did wish the camera would pull back and give us more full stage shots.  It's a minor quibble about a major Tony winning musical that is preserved with it's premiere cast.  (This is one of only 3 Tony winning musicals of the 1990s that has been preserved on video along with CRAZY FOR YOU and FOSSE.  Hopefully before too long videos of Broadway's top shows will become standard practice, in much the same way as the original cast recordings!)",5,A special show for a special audience,1054857600,"06 6, 2003",2003,2507,"['mixed', 'VHS', 'tape', 'soon', 'DVD', 'PASSION', 'are', 'understandable', 'One', 'person', 'commented', 'show', 'was', 'quot', 'slow', 'boring.', 'quot', 'true', 'very', 'European', 'style', 'yes', 'times', 'try', 'patience', 'stay', 'end', 'will', 'succumb', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'leading', 'man', 'Fosca', 'passion.The', 'music', 'together', 'tapestry', 'rich', 'melody', 'emotion', 'No', 'are', 'not', 'simplistic', 'tunes', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'vein', 'Sondheim', 'not', 'songwriter', 'trained', 'intelligent', 'composer', 'who', 'references', 'Stravinsky', 'Ravel', 'Gershwin', 'Russian', 'masters', 'where', 'use', 'melody', 'more', 'importantly', 'when', 'make', 'music', 'more', 'angular', 'Fosca', 'aria', 'quot', 'Read', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'example', 'this.Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'respond', 'show', 'Even', 'Broadway', 'people', 'laughed', 'inappropriate', 'moments', 'found', 'story', 'hard', 'believe', 'looking', 'Disney-styled', 'glitz', 'musical', 'comedy', 'tap', 'dancers', 'would', 'be', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'PASSION', 'not', 'musical', 'comedy', 'label', 'most', 'often', 'up', 'relation', 'PASSION', 'quot', 'chamber', 'opera', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'belong', 'intimate', 'opera', 'house', 'instead', 'Broadway', 'next', 'CATS', 'BEAUTY', 'AND', 'THE', 'BEAST.In', '2002', 'Sondheim', 'celebration', 'Kennedy', 'Center', 'Washington', 'PASSION', 'was', 'easily', 'best', 'six', 'productions', 'offered', 'yet', 'was', 'slowest', 'selling', 'show', 'many', 'audience', 'members', 'gave', 'standing', 'ovation', 'others', 'sat', 'stoney', 'silence.No', 'matter', 'what', 'initial', 'reaction', 'material', 'may', 'be', 'will', 'doubt', 'find', 'think', 'more', 'PASSION', 'other', 'quot', 'lighter', 'quot', 'entertainments', 'charcter', 'Fosca', 'will', 'haunt', 'long', 'play', 'ended', 'as', 'will', 'music', 'will', 'find', 'returning', 'second', 'third', 'look', 'listen', 'viewing', 'will', 'appreciate', 'many', 'layers', 'James', 'LaPine', 'spare', 'script', 'subtle', 'perfomances', 'cast', 'members.The', 'film', 'show', 'intimate', 'staging', 'though', 'times', 'did', 'wish', 'camera', 'would', 'pull', 'back', 'give', 'more', 'full', 'stage', 'shots', 'minor', 'quibble', 'major', 'Tony', 'winning', 'musical', 'preserved', 'premiere', 'cast', 'one', 'only', '3', 'Tony', 'winning', 'musicals', '1990s', 'been', 'preserved', 'video', 'CRAZY', 'FOR', 'YOU', 'FOSSE', 'Hopefully', 'too', 'long', 'videos', 'Broadway', 'top', 'shows', 'will', 'become', 'standard', 'practice', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'original', 'cast', 'recordings']",N/A

The performances are quite good--particularly Donna Murphy's portrayal of Fosca.  With the DVD, you get a chance to get closer to Fosca and experience the emotions with her.  Ms. Murphy is able to find beauty in desperation.  She convincingly takes her character on the immense journey from self-loathing to the belief that she is worthy of love.  Her portrayal is nothing short of astonishing.Marin Mazie looks and sounds lovely, and Jere Shea seems to start out a little wooden (although he is paying a soldier and wooden is a desirable trait in soldiers) but has some beautiful and heartfelt moments at the end of the show.If you are a fan of Sondheim, love stories, or excellent acting, this CD is well worth the price.

751519,A1N5YEQ29VU3C2,B000093NR3,Trout26,"[0, 0]","My first introduction to ""Passion"" was listenting to the OBC CD recording.  I was less than thrilled, but thought it was maybe something that you just had to see to appreciate.  Then I watched the American Playhouse TV broadcast of this video - and was equally disappointed. This was the same man who brought us ""Company"", Follies"", A Little Night Music"", ""Sweeney Todd"", ""Into the Woods"" (the last two rank as mt two favorite Broadway musicals of all times)? ""Assassins"" was abit quirky, but still was enjoyable.  But this? SLOW moving, almost no melodies that one could recognize, almost no staging, and a plot that was somewhat beyond believeable.  Where had Steven Sondheim gone?  Had he truly ""run dry"" of ideas? I wrote it off as an unfortunate punctuation mark at what seemed like the end of an amazing Broadway career.This past Christmas, my wife gave me the two volume ""Finishing the Hat""/""Look I Made a Hat"" set of books (Sondheim's self-edited and annotated collection of all of his lyrics), and on reading ""Passion"", it somehow moved me - and made me ""believe"" the story in ways that I hadn't in the past. So I decided to try the video again, and somewhat to my surprise, I liked it. I don't know if this is because I had read Sondheim's insights on the piece, if it was because I was 15 years older, or if it was because I went into it with low expectations vice high ones, but I enjoyed it enough to watch it twice. To me this will never hold as high a place as Sondheinm's ""great"" works of the 70s and 80s, but his genius for counterpoint and mixing song and spoken word are still present. And like the character or not, Donna Murphy's extrodinary performance as Fosca alone makes this video worth watching. Technically I have no complaints either; the picture and sound are as crisp as one could expect from a master as old as this now is.  I would recommend this to fans of Sondheim who want to hear a very different side of his writing, but I would NOT recommend it as a first introduction. For that, ""Into the Woods"" or ""Sweeney Todd"" (the Lansbury/Hearn stage recording, not the Depp film) are the way to start.",4,Improves with Age,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,2131,"['first', 'introduction', 'Passion', 'was', 'listenting', 'OBC', 'CD', 'recording', 'was', 'less', 'thrilled', 'thought', 'was', 'maybe', 'something', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'appreciate', 'Then', 'watched', 'American', 'Playhouse', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'video', 'was', 'equally', 'disappointed', 'was', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'Company', 'Follies', 'Little', 'Night', 'Music', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Woods', 'last', 'two', 'rank', 'mt', 'two', 'favorite', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'times', 'Assassins', 'was', 'abit', 'quirky', 'still', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'SLOW', 'moving', 'almost', 'melodies', 'one', 'could', 'recognize', 'almost', 'staging', 'plot', 'was', 'somewhat', 'believeable', 'Where', 'had', 'Steven', 'Sondheim', 'gone', 'Had', 'truly', 'run', 'dry', 'ideas', 'wrote', 'off', 'unfortunate', 'punctuation', 'mark', 'what', 'seemed', 'end', 'amazing', 'Broadway', 'career.This', 'past', 'Christmas', 'wife', 'gave', 'two', 'volume', 'Finishing', 'Hat', '/', 'Look', 'Made', 'Hat', 'set', 'books', 'Sondheim', 'self-edited', 'annotated', 'collection', 'lyrics', 'reading', 'Passion', 'somehow', 'moved', 'made', 'believe', 'story', 'ways', 'had', ""n't"", 'past', 'decided', 'try', 'video', 'again', 'somewhat', 'surprise', 'liked', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'read', 'Sondheim', 'insights', 'piece', 'was', 'was', '15', 'years', 'older', 'was', 'went', 'low', 'expectations', 'vice', 'high', 'ones', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'watch', 'twice', 'will', 'never', 'hold', 'as', 'high', 'place', 'Sondheinm', 'great', 'works', '70s', '80s', 'genius', 'counterpoint', 'mixing', 'song', 'spoken', 'word', 'are', 'still', 'present', 'character', 'not', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'extrodinary', 'performance', 'Fosca', 'alone', 'video', 'worth', 'watching', 'Technically', 'have', 'complaints', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'as', 'crisp', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'master', 'as', 'old', 'now', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Sondheim', 'who', 'want', 'hear', 'very', 'different', 'side', 'writing', 'would', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'first', 'introduction', 'Woods', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Lansbury/Hearn', 'stage', 'recording', 'not', 'Depp', 'film', 'are', 'way', 'start']",N/A

It's my favorite of Sondheim's works, which is really saying something.  So, I was very quick to get the DVD transfer of the original production as soon as it was out.From end to end, Passion is of a single piece.  The scene transitions and the dropping in and out of song are incredibly smooth, and Lapine's book is more refined and generally more enjoyable than his work on Sunday in the Park... or Into the Woods.  The performances are marvellous, particularly Donna Murphy as Fosca, who comes off even more spectacularly here than in the cast recording.  Jere Shea and Marin Mazzie more than hold their own, but Murphy is undoubtedly the star.  Her character is so compelling that the story really makes sense.But the great thing about the filmed version of Passion is how appropriate it was.  It is exquisitely filmed - moreso than Sunday or Woods - and the direction lets you get close to these amazing characters.  The costumes are gorgeous from end to end, and the physical acting was often fairly subtle on the stage.  That means that it all came off the better on film.  And the way the musical was produced was absolutely appropriate for film.  It feels like you're seeing a really interesting filmic version sometimes rather than a staged production.  That's the real triumph of this DVD:  it feels like the show was meant for it.If you even remotely like Sondheim or serious works of musical theatre, you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD as soon as possible.",5,A perfect transfer...,1055289600,"06 11, 2003",2003,1592,"[""'ve"", 'commented', 'review', 'magnificent', 'Original', 'Broadway', 'Cast', 'Recording', 'Passion', 'beautiful', 'score', 'favorite', 'Sondheim', 'works', 'really', 'saying', 'something', 'So', 'was', 'very', 'quick', 'get', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'original', 'production', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'out.From', 'end', 'end', 'Passion', 'single', 'piece', 'scene', 'transitions', 'dropping', 'song', 'are', 'incredibly', 'smooth', 'Lapine', 'book', 'more', 'refined', 'generally', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'work', 'Sunday', 'Park', 'Into', 'Woods', 'performances', 'are', 'marvellous', 'particularly', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'Fosca', 'who', 'off', 'even', 'more', 'spectacularly', 'here', 'cast', 'recording', 'Jere', 'Shea', 'Marin', 'Mazzie', 'more', 'hold', 'own', 'Murphy', 'undoubtedly', 'star', 'character', 'so', 'compelling', 'story', 'really', 'sense.But', 'great', 'thing', 'filmed', 'version', 'Passion', 'how', 'appropriate', 'was', 'exquisitely', 'filmed', 'moreso', 'Sunday', 'Woods', 'direction', 'get', 'close', 'amazing', 'characters', 'costumes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'end', 'end', 'physical', 'acting', 'was', 'often', 'fairly', 'subtle', 'stage', 'came', 'off', 'better', 'film', 'way', 'musical', 'was', 'produced', 'was', 'absolutely', 'appropriate', 'film', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'really', 'interesting', 'filmic', 'version', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'staged', 'production', 'real', 'triumph', 'DVD', 'show', 'was', 'meant', 'it.If', 'even', 'remotely', 'Sondheim', 'serious', 'works', 'musical', 'theatre', 'owe', 'buy', 'DVD', 'as', 'soon', 'possible']",N/A
