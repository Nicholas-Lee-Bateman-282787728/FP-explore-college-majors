Midler is the best thing in this film, The Rose is loosely-based on the life on Janis Joplin. Midler gives an intense and courageous performance.

I loved it then, and its nice to watch it now and see it has stood the test of time. A young Bette takes this movie andRUNS with it, displaying a GREAT rock and blues SOUND. The best song WAS and is the title song, however. I don't think anyone else could have done the songs as WELL or played the Rose...If you love Bette, then you'll love this movie. It'sa fine additon to any movie collection.My only criticism, is the songs beyond the title song...Not that memorable and not good rock , but Bette's performanace lifts the wholemovie...

370319,A2582KMXLK2P06,6303354742,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Rose is a classic.  It contains excellent storyline writing and drama along with an *incredible* soundtrack.  These songs are awesome.  I wouldn't expect anything less from the 70's, however.  A golden period for music of ALL varities.The film is about Bette Midler playing the role of the main character that goes by the name Rose.  She's a character that's a very successful performer and singer, however, her life goes through plenty of ups and downs... mostly downs.For one thing, she has a severe drinking problem.  She drinks alcohol like most of us drink water, and she's usually drunk when performing on stage.  She's also extremely belligerent and stuck in her ways so it's really hard to explain anything helpful to her.  She'll just ignore it.Her manager is a control freak basically who's stuck in his own ways as well.  This means the manager and Bette Midler's character constantly get into preventable arguments.  Rose wants to take a lengthy break from all the touring and singing because she's burnt out and needs some time to recover, however her contract doesn't allow any time off whatsoever.  Sooner, rather than later, her life spirals out of control as a result.She meets a nice man during a limousine ride (the chauffeur) and they quickly hit off a wonderful relationship.  If you think for a moment that this extremely courteous man has the potential to change Rose into a better, more civilized woman... think again!  She's too far gone, unfortunately.  This is what the movie revolves around- her story.I appreciate how the movie writers took time to allow Rose's stage performance to complete a few really good songs.  Like I say above, the soundtrack is really surprisingly memorable.  What the writers succeeded in accomplishing the most, however, is allowing time to build the character of Rose so we're able to witness every single aspect of her emotions.  This is best expressed during the final 20 minutes which is nothing short of brilliant writing.I won't spoil the ending so I'll just say this... I should have paid closer attention to a certain unexplainable scene in the very beginning.  Seeing as how the movie is over 2 hours, I completely forgot about it by the 2-hour mark, though.The Rose is a surprise.  Sure, it's dated (what movie from the 70's isn't dated though?) but I really love everything about this movie.  The writing, the song selection, the acting, everything is really phenomenal.",5,immensely touching,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,2442,"['Rose', 'classic', 'excellent', 'storyline', 'writing', 'drama', '*incredible*', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'are', 'awesome', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', '70', 'however', 'golden', 'period', 'music', 'ALL', 'varities.The', 'film', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'playing', 'role', 'main', 'character', 'name', 'Rose', 'character', 'very', 'successful', 'performer', 'singer', 'however', 'life', 'plenty', 'ups', 'downs', 'mostly', 'one', 'thing', 'severe', 'drinking', 'problem', 'alcohol', 'most', 'drink', 'water', 'usually', 'drunk', 'when', 'performing', 'stage', 'also', 'extremely', 'belligerent', 'stuck', 'ways', 'really', 'hard', 'explain', 'anything', 'helpful', ""'ll"", 'just', 'ignore', 'it.Her', 'manager', 'control', 'freak', 'basically', 'who', 'stuck', 'own', 'ways', 'as', 'well', 'manager', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'character', 'constantly', 'get', 'preventable', 'arguments', 'Rose', 'take', 'lengthy', 'break', 'touring', 'singing', 'burnt', 'out', 'time', 'recover', 'however', 'contract', ""n't"", 'allow', 'time', 'off', 'whatsoever', 'Sooner', 'rather', 'later', 'life', 'spirals', 'control', 'result.She', 'nice', 'man', 'limousine', 'ride', 'chauffeur', 'quickly', 'hit', 'off', 'wonderful', 'relationship', 'think', 'moment', 'extremely', 'courteous', 'man', 'potential', 'change', 'Rose', 'better', 'more', 'civilized', 'woman', 'think', 'again', 'too', 'far', 'gone', 'unfortunately', 'what', 'movie', 'around-', 'story.I', 'appreciate', 'how', 'movie', 'writers', 'took', 'time', 'allow', 'Rose', 'stage', 'performance', 'complete', 'few', 'really', 'good', 'songs', 'say', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'surprisingly', 'memorable', 'What', 'writers', 'succeeded', 'accomplishing', 'most', 'however', 'allowing', 'time', 'build', 'character', 'Rose', ""'re"", 'able', 'witness', 'single', 'aspect', 'emotions', 'best', 'expressed', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'writing.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'should', 'have', 'paid', 'closer', 'attention', 'certain', 'unexplainable', 'scene', 'very', 'beginning', 'Seeing', 'how', 'movie', '2', 'hours', 'completely', 'forgot', '2-hour', 'mark', 'though.The', 'Rose', 'surprise', 'Sure', 'dated', 'what', 'movie', '70', ""n't"", 'dated', 'really', 'love', 'everything', 'movie', 'writing', 'song', 'selection', 'acting', 'everything', 'really', 'phenomenal']",The Rose VHS
370320,AH1KJ45IQTM4T,6303354742,Benjamin,"[2, 2]","This is a very good movie (and cheap! While I'm writing this it's only $6,99) that tells us the story of a Rock Singer, The Rose, inspired in the life of Janis Joplin, kind of. Bette Midler sings all the songs and her role here is terrific. The movie is from the late 70's, so don't expect fancy film effects. Just enjoy the performances by Midler and the aura of those old Rock 'N' Roll artists who gave everything for their audiences, maybe a little bit too much. Those were the times where there was no difference between show and life. Those were the times when an artist could just drop by any Night Club/Hole any city in the US and give their very best, just for the sake of Art. Enjoy this movie and if you can, buy the Soundtrack as well. The Rose, the song that closes the credits in the movie, is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever listened to.Recommended to any Bette Midler fan, to sex-drugs-& R'N'R fans, and to all Rock fans from the 60's, 70's, and fans to Janis Joplin. Rated R for drug use, alcohol abuse and strong language. After all of these, there is an after-sex scene where The Rose is in bed but you see her ""purely"" covered so we can't see anything. Makes no sense, but those were the 70's.

Rose's charactor often resembles the 60's sensation, Janis Joplin.

Not only does she act superbly but also sings like a 60's rock star with extraordinary ease. Her facial expressions and body movements are timed perfectly and just about everything that an actress should do, she does ... perfectly.Without midler this is a mediocre film that can be easily forgotten but her gut wrentching performance makes ""The Rose"" one of the best films of the later 70's.Grade: B+ (Close to an A-)",4,"""Where's everybody going!?""",1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1078,"['Rose', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Mary', 'Rose', 'better', 'known', 'just', 'Rose', 'Rose', 'charactor', 'often', '60', 'sensation', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'Joplin', 'was', 'called', 'Pearl', 'Mary', 'Rose', 'was', 'called', 'Rose', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'aspects', 'share', 'am', 'sure', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'pointing', 'out', 'pretty', 'easily', 'even', 'seeing', 'film', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Thoroughly', 'thought', 'screenplay', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'direction', 'was', 'pretty', 'descent', 'even', 'visuals', 'were', 'pretty', 'cool', '1970', 'BUT', 'Bette', 'Midlers', 'performance', 'really', 'film', 'greatness.Midler', 'details', 'performance', 'Not', 'only', 'act', 'superbly', 'also', 'sings', '60', 'rock', 'star', 'extraordinary', 'ease', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'movements', 'are', 'timed', 'perfectly', 'just', 'everything', 'actress', 'should', 'do', 'perfectly.Without', 'midler', 'mediocre', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'forgotten', 'gut', 'wrentching', 'performance', 'Rose', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'later', ""70's.Grade"", 'B+', 'Close', 'A-']",The Rose VHS

Pawl ""Dani""","[1, 1]","When The Rose was originally released, in 1979, I was not even a glimmer in my mom's eye, but, knew well of the famous title song, growing up and into my early college years. The haunting melody and lyric are so beautiful and memorable, I even learned to play it on the piano and sing it for a music class. It nearly made me cry. While a young teenager, I had the great good fortune of being introduced to some of the most legendary music of the 1960s and 1970s. My mom had been a radio show producer, for some five years, and had a great record collection and wonderful ear for good songs. One of the singers I came to fall in love with was the late, great Janis Joplin, who became a part of the ill-fated ""27 Club."" Some of the best and brightest musicians were snuffed out, at age twenty seven years old, due to hard living (read: substance abuse, destructive life choices).This film depicts the life of a Janis Joplin-esque rock star (Bette Midler), who goes by ""The Rose."" She is burnt out by her hard life on the road, filled with empty affairs, hard drugs and plenty of alcohol. She is exhausted, drained and self destructive. Though she begs for time off from the road - a year off to get some much needed rest - from her manager (Alan Bates) he does not allow it. There is too much money riding on her gigs. So, The Rose must force herself to sing, tour and takes different measures to maintain her fiery, sultry and charismatic stage persona (self medicating with booze, drugs and picking up groupies along the way - male and female).Bette Midler has an amazing and ethereal quality, here. She is funny, haunted and absolutely unforgettable. She sings and struts her way through a string of hard, bluesy and sexy songs. You feel her character's emptiness, despair and instability. Her wicked manager uses her as his cash cow, even though it is clear that she is destroying herself over her level of fame and the pressures of the road that completely take her away from any sense of peace. The performances are sensitive, gritty and unabashedly believable. It saddens me that Bette Midler did not win an Academy Award for this wonderful performance of her career. What a brilliant performer - as actress and singer. Wow. This film will stay with me for some time.

The onstage scenes are among the best ever captured on film... Bette Middler, the band, and the entire production company were obviously in top form.  At the time and even now no one accept maybe Tina Turner) was anything like her...  Most of the shooting even puts to shame the ""live concerts"" you see on MTV today, even with the latest state of the art technology ! ! !Loosely based on the life of Janis Joplin, the film doesn't really go much into her upbringing, origins and rise to stardom, but moreso shows her demise at the hands of her greedy manager who simply won't let her quit... She does her best to ""get away"" (acting out, escaping, wreaking havoc, falling in love, going on drinking binges) between the concernts, but can never quite escape... and always winds back on the stage, which is where she shines and perhaps the only place she was meant to be...  and with a band like that, why not ? I remember playing the soundtrack over and over again as a child.  Incidentally two other great ""concert films"" were made in this era, THE JAZZ SINGER (starring Neil Diamond as a rock and roll singer who marries a shikseh and decides to strut his stuff on Yom Kippur to the aghast of his alte kakker father) and the (deservedly) much forgotten WAY OF THE WORLD, featuring live concert footage of Earth Wind and Fire... The BLUES BROTHERS would follow a few years later...This was an era when THE CONCERT was a major part of American life (pre VCR, DVD, digital audio and cable) and that going to concert was part of the American experience... this movie was more than aware of America's fascination with the whole scene from what was going on backstage and the ""glamour"" of what was happening behind the scenes... and it did it unforgettably well.

370338,A39AZT0WDM8AC9,6303354742,KEVIN BRIAN,"[0, 1]","It is about 12:30 and I just finished watching The Rose. Though, I've always be fond of the song, I've never seen the movie before.So,so sad. My eyes are watery and my stomach tight. My heart, broken.What a lonely, cold tale about a rock star living on the edge. And, being a film from the 70's, they really take their time here to let Bette Midler feel and live through this character. A character who is raw, impulsive and self-destructive. At times, very much like a little girl lost. She is just outstanding here.But what is so sad about this character is she is merely just a puppet. Her manager pulls the strings and refuses to listen to her pratically beg for some time off....'Just one year.' she promises.Another character, an old female friend/lover, who comes late into the movie also pressures her for attention. Her new young guy friend, obliviously her first 'true love', or...(is it just desperation to feel wanted?)...also pushes her for a commitment. He wants her to run off to Mexico with him and leave everything behind.And then there's her old buddy,from her home town, the drug dealer that dangles the stuff in front of her even after she says 'I'm clean now'.I know this is just a simple review of things that happen in the movie and to the character. There is so much more going on under the surface that only a true movie lover would appreciate. Or, someone who is interested in 'what goes on behind the scenes' of falling celebrities. And then, of course, if your a Bette Midler fan, well, I'm sure you have already seen this or know about.Remember, the movie does take it's time (which is usually the norm for character dramas back in the day) and the concert scenes go on for awhile, often giving the movie a docu-drama kinda feel.For me, 'Beaches' will always be my favorite Bette Film. But I'm not going to compare them. They are two totally different styles. I like soap opera like drama, and  'Beaches' has that in spades.I remember being introduced to Bette in the 80's when I was about sixteen. I remember seeing 'Ruthless People' 'Outrageous Fortune' and a few of her other comedies in the theaters and hearing people roar with laughter. About a few years later, I was in Washington, D.C. with my then boyfriend, and, on the way back to home, we passed a theater and decided to see a movie there at random.Well, when I saw it was 'Beaches' on the marquee, I said 'hell, why not. Let's go see another Bette Midler comedy.' I had no idea that, even though it was a comedy, it was also a drama. I was still thinkin' she was making silly films like 'Big Business' with her and dorky Lily Tomlin.Boy, was I wrong! The melodrama hit me like a tidal wave and the moment I saw the hearse, and heard Bette's 'Wing Beneath' song play, tears squirted out of my eyes like a little baby. Seriously. I cried the entire 45 minutes back to Baltimore, non-stop that night. Thank God I wasn't driving. And I hardly ever cry at contrived Hollywood films. My favorite genre is horror movies for crying out loud!Anyway, that's when I really took notice of Bette Midler. Okay, sorry to digress. Back to The Rose!Midler is really wonderful in it. She is the star, along with her manager. I only wish it had trimmed some of the concert footage and fleshed out some of the minor characters around her.I would of liked to learn more about her connection with her parents, and definitely more about David Keith's character who plays a military boy she picks up in a bar. It seems like a huge chunk of story concerning him was left out. I also picked up on a small hint of 'hanky panky' three-way action between Bette, him and the other guy she falls for. There is eyeball play for a quick second between the guys, and later, Bette and Keith get trashed and 'have a moment'...but nothing really shines any light on that.I guess that's not the point of the film. But I wish they didn't introduce characters, and then just toss them to the sidelines, especially when the players feel so, erotically-charged.  There IS a story going on, somewhere, between her and her two young handsome suitors, but, like I said, it's only hinted at.I guess I just wanted more melodrama than is needed here. Or, I'm looking for a homo-erotic edge that just wasn't there. You tell me. Nevertheless, The Rose is a fine movie and Bette is incredible! Check it out.

The mood swings are like an emotional rollercoaster ride. Her highs are quite high, and the lows, well, watch the film. The director's commentary is well worth watching and provided some insight into many of the scenes and the set-ups and so forth. The thing that makes this movie awesome is that the live music was performed live, in front of various live audiences. Hats off to members of Alice Cooper's backup band at the time for kicking butt as Rose's band! Stellar performances. Apparently, the directors told people to ""show up just like it was the 60s again"" and they did! Midler has some pretty salty and memorible lines in this film...she can be wonderfully crass, yet we feel for her, pity her, and route for her throughout the story. That's called good filmmaking folks, and great acting. I disagree with the reviewer who said the film drags....no way. We are treated to long takes on single cameras. Even the live shots are not all choppy like an MTV video, thank goodness! This move was ground-breaking for it's time (1979) due to certain adult themes and language, it was very powerful and hard hitting and remains so. I saw this in NYC at the Ziegfield on opening week. The sound in the theatre was full-on concert mode! Perfectly clear and loud.

Throwing all of herself into this role, Bette Midler must have been exhausted at the end of shooting. It was exhausting just watching her character unravel. I have an insight and I may be wrong, as I am no psychiatrist, but I feel strongly that Mary Rose suffered from borderline personality disorder; she showed all the symptoms: fear of abandonment, alcohol/drug abuse & addiction, impulsive rage, impulsive sexual liasions, self-loathing, striking out at the one who loved her most, to name a few. Even though she was a fictional character, albeit loosely based on Janis Joplin, she felt real to me. Her reckless self-destruction was painful to see and I must admit I wept for her.

There is not a false note in Midler's portrayal of a neurotic, desperately needy, burned-out, over-stimulated rock star who's had too much of everything in the wrong dosages. Midler brings a buzzing, physical charge to the movie, one that carries itself over to the viewer: it can leave you exhausted long before the movie's end. Enacting the role of a rock singer, Midler is the real thing. It helps, of course, that her true calling is that of a concert singer, but she has all the vitality, hyperkinetic presence and true star quality of the greatest female performers: the audience's response to her in the concert scenes has total believability. It's entirely possible, too, to feel both revulsion and a deep pity for the character's horrifying unpredictability and destructive lifestyle. Midler is such a charismatic presence that when you see her downing all the pills and booze leading to her death, you can actually feel the force of her own personality (and unerring acting skills) transmitting through to the viewer, of the drug's increasing take over. In the end, as her Rose, in the midst of a song, teeters further into her drug-induced stupor, and topples over in death, Midler achieves a genuine horror and tragedy. How Midler manages to leave such a feeling of dread and queasiness is a testament to her genius; her voice, her body, and soul seem to be dying right in front of our very eyes - it no longer feels like a performance.  It's as if a real singer was somehow caught on film in the last stages of being self-snuffed out.

Bette Midler does an incredible job of re-creating a life of turmoil through the eyes of a sixties rock diva. An exhausted, burned out alcoholic who begs her promoter/manager (played by Alan Bates,) to give her a year off to rest, ""The Rose,"" is on the path of destruction.  When she hooks up with an AWOL Vietnam War Veteran, you find yourself hoping he can calm her down enough to save her, but of course, you know that won't happen.Much of the movie is actual concert footage of Midler singing her heart out, doing ""Janis Joplin like,"" tunes, but again, this movie misses something by not using the real stuff.  And, as well as Midler belts out the songs, she sounds like Bette Midler singing 60's rock anthems and bluesy ballads; she doesn't sound like Janis Joplin at all.  Of course, Bette Midler doesn't look anything like Joplin, either.  Midler is a red-headed Jewish girl and Joplin was a bushy haired brunette from Port Charles, LA.

When I picked it up, finally, in the library I thought it was the life of Janis Joplin.  Well, obviously it's based on her life but this is presented as a fictional character.  I was a big Joplin fan back in the day but I really can't imagine that she would have done a better job than Better Midler.The story is pretty predictable.  We've seen the brilliant, talented, self-destructive, musicians' lives before, complete with romantic heartbreak, booze and drugs.  Nothing new here.  But Midler does is so well.  Her singing and acting are both superlative.  This is not a one-dimensional performance.  As firey and wild as she is at times, she's also amazingly delicate and fragile at others.Frederick Forrest is wonderful, too, as the fellow who seems to have the best chance of saving her from herself.  He's a terrific actor and very cute.  Alan Bates is good, too, as the greedy manager with the 70's hairdo.There are a lot of concert shots which are filled with energy and style but some of her best performances are the smaller ones, like in the drag club.  Midler, as the Rose, fills her performances with so much energy and joy that you have to love her and root for her.The film is a perfect shanpshot of a moment in time---the rock scene of the 60's and 70's.  But it holds up today, unlike others of that genre, mostly because of the performance of the Divine Miss M.  She's a great singer, a terrific comedienne and a powerful dramatic actress---what a combination.  She is quite slender and beautiful here, too.

A truly excellent performance. Her concert scenes were good, too. Frederic Forrest was nominated for an Oscar, and he was quite fine (he was also in &quot;Norma Rae&quot; with Sally Field, who won the Oscar over Midler in '79).

Sorely missing from the nominations were the Adapted Score and the wonderful title Song, written by Amanda McBroom.

Bette Midler is absolutely fantastic (as always) and her songs are pure energy. I'd say an alternative title would have been 'Forces of Nature'. For me the best part ever is the last one, from when she's left alone in her home town and makes a stop at a bar she used to sing. After she's dragged out and takes all the pills she is so out of it and how can't you feel for her. She drives to the old school where she makes one of the most sad calls in history, to her parents, and if you have seen it before, you know it's the last time their parents will ever speak to her. Then she recollects what's left of her power and manges to call her manager, only to pull herself up to the stage and sing her last song. How can you not die when you see what happens next? And right after it, the title song, most depressing song ever, starts and plays on the end titles and on a moving bulb light. The 'Camellia' scored part where she's choppered in as well, a prelude to this sad end. One of the best movies for me, just for this part and for all of it.

It sounds like a cliche, and by now it is, but that was Janis--and Bette does her one better. Her angst shines through with great poignancy, even when she is belting out hit after hit, responding to her audience as though she is making love.Hard living, hard boozing, and bent on destroying herself, the singer has us riveted to her story. Her tearful phone call to the father who never approved of her is one of the high points of the film: Bette pulls out the stops.Alan Bates is divine as always as the singer's manager, but this film belongs to Bette.

370367,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6303354742,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","I finally got to see ""The Rose"" (1979) last night. It's a sad tale of a Janis Joplin-like rock star, Mary Rose Foster (Bette Midler), who desperately wants to take a break from the rock 'n' roll train, but her manager (Alan Bates) won't let her due to business obligations.It's not all sad though. The film plays-out like a docudrama with quite a bit of lively concert footage. If you like this style of rock (guitar/horns/etc.) you'll like the movie more than I did. The Rose falls for a limo driver (Fredric Forrest) and they have some misadventures, mostly at bars and other places of the night, like a drag queen show. The plot culminates in The Rose' ""coming home"" gig at her hometown in Florida.Bette is passionate in the role, but I was never a fan. Nor do I dislike her; I'm neutral. The role calls for a lot of hysteria because that's the rock star lifestyle, at least it was in that era, 1970. As such, the film's really over-the-top. If you can't stomach a lot of hysterical scenes I'd suggest staying away.I prefer 1991's ""The Doors"", which has the same theme, but is about a real individual, Jim Morrison, and contains more recognizable (better) music.BOTTOM LINE: Unless you like Bette Midler and the style of music, this movie won't likely trip your trigger. It's the story of a rock star who needs a break but can't get it, so she goes totally out of control. It's ""sex, drugs and Rock 'n' roll,"" but it's mostly alcohol and rock 'n' roll -- music, alcohol, bars, music, alcohol, bars, repeat to the end. That's the movie. I'm skipping something, but I don't want to give it away; it should be obvious anyway.GRADE: C+",3,A train wreck waiting to happen,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,1634,"['finally', 'got', 'see', 'Rose', '1979', 'last', 'night', 'sad', 'tale', 'Janis', 'Joplin-like', 'rock', 'star', 'Mary', 'Rose', 'Foster', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'who', 'desperately', 'take', 'break', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'train', 'manager', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'due', 'business', 'obligations.It', 'not', 'sad', 'film', 'plays-out', 'docudrama', 'bit', 'lively', 'concert', 'footage', 'like', 'style', 'rock', 'guitar/horns/etc', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'more', 'did', 'Rose', 'falls', 'limo', 'driver', 'Fredric', 'Forrest', 'have', 'misadventures', 'mostly', 'bars', 'other', 'places', 'night', 'drag', 'queen', 'show', 'plot', 'Rose', 'coming', 'home', 'gig', 'hometown', 'Florida.Bette', 'passionate', 'role', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'do', 'dislike', ""'m"", 'neutral', 'role', 'lot', 'hysteria', 'rock', 'star', 'lifestyle', 'least', 'was', 'era', '1970', 'such', 'film', 'really', 'over-the-top', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'lot', 'hysterical', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'staying', 'away.I', 'prefer', '1991', 'Doors', 'same', 'theme', 'real', 'individual', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'more', 'recognizable', 'better', 'music.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'style', 'music', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'likely', 'trip', 'trigger', 'story', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'break', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'totally', 'control', 'sex', 'drugs', 'Rock', 'n', 'roll', 'mostly', 'alcohol', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'music', 'alcohol', 'bars', 'music', 'alcohol', 'bars', 'repeat', 'end', 'movie', ""'m"", 'skipping', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'anyway.GRADE', 'C+']",The Rose VHS
