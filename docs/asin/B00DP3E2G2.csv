1660199,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00DP3E2G2,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","I have no real interest in surfing, but when I see it on the screen, it never ceases to amaze me. No exception here.Here's the scoop. Set in Australia, ma Kelly grabs her two young boys and blows town leaving an abusive husband behind. They end up in some bust-out coastal town. The boys grow, learn to surf and try to start up a surfing gear company. while mom struggles to make ends meet. A Hippy drifter, who makes a living filming and photographing surfers, happens into town and the dynamic changes.This is a pretty cool flick. You like the characters and feel for their situation. The younger brother Jimmy Kelly (Xavier Samuel) is a top notch surfer. His older brother Andy (Myles Pollard) is a bit more serious and more than a bit the loner. Sam Worthington plays the Hippy photographer. He's a bit weird with his Zen padder and talk of &#34;Chi&#34; but he makes things happen. They aren't always good but the boys' heads are turned because of him. Mom loves her boys and tries to protect them even as they've grown to adulthood. But you see them struggle with relationships, start a business and cope with the rising drug culture of the 60s. The surf scenes are well directed. The viewer gets the great sense of the simultaneous wonder and menace that the big waves hold.There is drama and threat here to keep some sense of tension. The local thug. The bank wanting mom's house. The good friend succumbing to drugs, but it's still a pretty calm movie. Thank the writer/director for the third act fluke that sends the flick into the feel good ending. This is a bit better than the three stars I gave it. It's a good watch and more than a bit satisfying. Just don't expect to grab a board and head tot the beach when it's over.",3,Surf's Up......A Bit,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,1735,"['have', 'real', 'interest', 'surfing', 'when', 'see', 'screen', 'never', 'amaze', 'exception', 'scoop', 'Set', 'Australia', 'ma', 'Kelly', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'blows', 'town', 'leaving', 'abusive', 'husband', 'end', 'up', 'bust-out', 'coastal', 'town', 'boys', 'grow', 'learn', 'surf', 'try', 'start', 'up', 'surfing', 'gear', 'company', 'mom', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'A', 'Hippy', 'drifter', 'who', 'living', 'filming', 'photographing', 'surfers', 'town', 'dynamic', 'changes.This', 'pretty', 'cool', 'flick', 'characters', 'feel', 'situation', 'younger', 'brother', 'Jimmy', 'Kelly', 'Xavier', 'Samuel', 'top', 'notch', 'surfer', 'older', 'brother', 'Andy', 'Myles', 'Pollard', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'more', 'bit', 'loner', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'Hippy', 'photographer', 'bit', 'weird', 'Zen', 'padder', 'talk', '34', 'Chi', '34', 'things', 'happen', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'good', 'boys', 'heads', 'are', 'turned', 'Mom', 'boys', 'tries', 'protect', 'even', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'adulthood', 'see', 'struggle', 'relationships', 'start', 'business', 'cope', 'rising', 'drug', 'culture', '60s', 'surf', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'directed', 'viewer', 'great', 'sense', 'simultaneous', 'wonder', 'menace', 'big', 'waves', 'drama', 'threat', 'here', 'keep', 'sense', 'tension', 'local', 'thug', 'bank', 'wanting', 'mom', 'house', 'good', 'friend', 'succumbing', 'drugs', 'still', 'pretty', 'calm', 'movie', 'Thank', 'writer/director', 'third', 'act', 'fluke', 'flick', 'feel', 'good', 'ending', 'bit', 'better', 'three', 'stars', 'gave', 'good', 'watch', 'more', 'bit', 'satisfying', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'grab', 'board', 'head', 'tot', 'beach', 'when', 'over']",Drift Digital

1660203,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00DP3E2G2,Tony Heck,"[2, 2]","""You know the trouble with being the last man standing? You got no one to share it with."" This is the true story of Jimmy (Samuel) & Andy Kelly. They are two brothers who share a love for surfing. When they come up with an idea to open a shop to sell their own gear Andy is 100% into it while Jimmy just wants to do his own thing. Between the money problems, the dangerous waves and angry bikers things don't go as easy as the brothers planned. There have been a few surfing movies to come out in the last few years. Soul Surfer I thought was very good. Chasing Mavericks was OK. This one is a little of both. The first hour and a half were a little slow and I almost stopped it a few times, but the ending was great and I am very glad that I stuck with it. There are some movies that are good but the ending seems to ruin everything. This one is the opposite. The movie is a little slow moving but the ending makes up for it. Overall, a movie that is a struggle in some parts but the end is a great reward for sticking with it. I give it a B-.",3,A movie that is very slow moving almost the whole time but the ending is very good. Surfing fans will really like this.

1660204,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00DP3E2G2,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","Set in 1972, West Australia, a 2013 Australian film ""Drift"" follows the story of two brothers with conflicting personality traits. Andy Kelly (Myles Pollard, who also produces) and Jimmy Kelly (Xavier Samuel) are surfers who start a surf shop in their garage. While their business goes well, their childhood friend Gus (Aaron Glenane) gets involved with a local biker and drug dealer Miller (Steve Bastoni).Sam Worthington plays JB, a hippie-like surf photographer travelling with a beautiful Hawaiian girl Lani (Lesley-Ann Brandt). Third-billed Worthington, known for Hollywood blockbusters like ""Terminator Salvation"" and ""Avatar,"" appears in a comparatively smaller role.Though the film claims the story is ""inspired by actual events,"" I think most of it is very loosely based on facts. The film's drama is not very interesting with stock characters and a familiar storyline. Conflicts arise between the characters in a predictable way, and then they are easily resolved.The surf scenes are pretty impressive, though we want more of them with better editing. ""Drift"" is a so-so drama with fine surf sequences.",3,Surfing in West Australia 1972: Nice Surf Scenes and Clich&eacute;d Storyline,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,1112,"['Set', '1972', 'West', 'Australia', '2013', 'Australian', 'film', 'Drift', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'conflicting', 'personality', 'traits', 'Andy', 'Kelly', 'Myles', 'Pollard', 'who', 'also', 'Jimmy', 'Kelly', 'Xavier', 'Samuel', 'are', 'surfers', 'who', 'start', 'surf', 'shop', 'garage', 'business', 'well', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Gus', 'Aaron', 'Glenane', 'involved', 'local', 'biker', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Miller', 'Steve', 'Bastoni', '.Sam', 'Worthington', 'JB', 'hippie-like', 'surf', 'photographer', 'travelling', 'beautiful', 'Hawaiian', 'girl', 'Lani', 'Lesley-Ann', 'Brandt', 'Third-billed', 'Worthington', 'known', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', 'Avatar', 'comparatively', 'smaller', 'film', 'story', 'inspired', 'actual', 'events', 'think', 'most', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'facts', 'film', 'drama', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'stock', 'characters', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'Conflicts', 'arise', 'characters', 'predictable', 'way', 'then', 'are', 'easily', 'resolved.The', 'surf', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'want', 'more', 'better', 'editing', 'Drift', 'so-so', 'drama', 'fine', 'surf', 'sequences']",Drift Digital
1660205,A2ZUKKX1CODYNH,B00DP3E2G2,Vas,"[5, 6]","I recently watched this movie and thought it was very interesting. It has a good plot and interesting characters. Simple filming, realistic expectations. I liked the fact that it did not have extra effects or complicated relationships evolving between the characters just to keep the plot going. It deals 60% with entrepreneurship and 40% with surfing. Maybe they should have marketed it that way, it would probably 'sell more'. A disadvantage is that in the beginning of the movie the relationships between the characters are not explained well, and the viewer gets confused.
