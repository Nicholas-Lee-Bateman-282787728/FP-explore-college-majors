In fact, this series houses two of my all-time favorite anime characters: Fam and Lyle.  And though this will never be my favorite anime series, it will certainly always rank pretty high on my charts.  This was a joy to watch, and I've seen this series many times over.  It had an endearing, bittersweet story, plenty of action, romance, and even a few comical moments.  And the animation isn't anything to be sneezed at, either!  And for you bishonen lovers out there, check out Lyle!  With a well though-out and drawn-out plot, with interesting characters and cool animation to boot....",4,Ruin Explorers -- A Wonderful Artifact!,994723200,"07 10, 2001",2001,682,"['Though', 'short', 'series', 'was', 'far', 'lacking', 'good', 'storyline', 'character', 'development', 'fact', 'series', 'houses', 'two', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'anime', 'characters', 'Fam', 'Lyle', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'will', 'certainly', 'always', 'rank', 'pretty', 'high', 'charts', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'endearing', 'bittersweet', 'story', 'plenty', 'action', 'romance', 'even', 'few', 'comical', 'moments', 'animation', ""n't"", 'anything', 'be', 'sneezed', 'bishonen', 'lovers', 'there', 'check', 'out', 'Lyle', 'well', 'though-out', 'drawn-out', 'plot', 'interesting', 'characters', 'cool', 'animation', 'boot']",N/A

It even cause me to tears up about what happened at the end - the true story of the remaining characters. I was a bit disappointed when I found out that Ruin Explorer, which advertisted heavily on the earlier ADV dvds were a short story but this made more than use up for it! I gave it only a four star because there are not a lot of reference material in this short sequel like what the heck is specific kind of magic? and how is it releated to the other specific kinds of magic. There is more examples but I don't want to spoil the surprise!  Also I would have liked to know what of the curse on the main character - did she accepted it or went back to her mentor to resolve it?",4,Very interesting!,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,787,"['dvd', 'have', 'adventure', 'started', 'out', 'comedy', 'then', 'turn', 'more', 'drama', 'end', 'even', 'cause', 'tears', 'up', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'true', 'story', 'remaining', 'characters', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Ruin', 'Explorer', 'advertisted', 'heavily', 'earlier', 'ADV', 'dvds', 'were', 'short', 'story', 'made', 'more', 'use', 'up', 'gave', 'only', 'four', 'star', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'reference', 'material', 'short', 'sequel', 'what', 'heck', 'specific', 'kind', 'magic', 'how', 'releated', 'other', 'specific', 'kinds', 'magic', 'more', 'examples', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'surprise', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'know', 'what', 'curse', 'main', 'character', 'did', 'accepted', 'went', 'back', 'mentor', 'resolve']",N/A
550616,A1AQ6NT5X4TMX1,B00004TJN3,Matthew Lafrance,"[4, 6]","Ruin Explorers, a.k.a. Fam &amp; Ihrie, is the story of two adventurers pillaging the ruins of an ancient civilization for the &quot;Ultimate Power&quot;. Though this could easily be bad from the start, the slapstick humor and goofy characters are surprisingly entertaining. The 4 episode series only begins to falter when the heroines and their rivals get caught up in someone else's quest for the Ultimate Power. Unlike Nadia where there is plenty of time to explore the Nautilus' goal and how the main characters fit into it, the shift of focus is too quick and just doesn't come off right. The music, performed by the Versailles Chamber Orchestra, is above average. The English dub is quality stuff; Jessica Calvello's Fam is superb. The Japanese track is equally as enjoyable and both audio tracks are Dolby Digital 2 channel. The menus are pleasant to look at and browse. A small cell gallery is included as an extra. The strength of the duo of Fam and Ihrie really outshines this 4 episode OAV series, and would be great material for a TV show. I give this disk 4 stars for the strength of the first few episodes and the quality DVD. For a fantasy fan there is a lot to like about Fam and Ihrie, others may find the story not quite enough.",4,Fam you idiot!,1008720000,"12 19, 2001",2001,1246,"['Ruin', 'Explorers', 'a.k.a', 'Fam', 'amp', 'Ihrie', 'story', 'two', 'adventurers', 'pillaging', 'ruins', 'ancient', 'civilization', 'quot', 'Ultimate', 'Power', 'quot', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'bad', 'start', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'goofy', 'characters', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', '4', 'episode', 'series', 'only', 'falter', 'when', 'heroines', 'rivals', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'someone', 'else', 'quest', 'Ultimate', 'Power', 'Nadia', 'where', 'plenty', 'time', 'explore', 'Nautilus', 'goal', 'how', 'main', 'characters', 'fit', 'shift', 'focus', 'too', 'quick', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'right', 'music', 'performed', 'Versailles', 'Chamber', 'Orchestra', 'above', 'average', 'English', 'dub', 'quality', 'stuff', 'Jessica', 'Calvello', 'Fam', 'superb', 'Japanese', 'track', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'audio', 'tracks', 'are', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2', 'channel', 'menus', 'are', 'pleasant', 'look', 'browse', 'small', 'cell', 'gallery', 'included', 'extra', 'strength', 'duo', 'Fam', 'Ihrie', 'really', '4', 'episode', 'OAV', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'material', 'TV', 'show', 'give', 'disk', '4', 'stars', 'strength', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'quality', 'DVD', 'fantasy', 'fan', 'lot', 'like', 'Fam', 'Ihrie', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'story', 'not', 'quite', 'enough']",N/A
550617,A2O6KLIFWEKL51,B00004TJN3,P. Krug,"[8, 9]","O.K., here's the story: it's set in a fantasy world where adventurers go exploring ruins searching for treasure and any magical items they can find. If this sounds like any D&amp;D game you played, don't let that throw you off. This has enough action and comedy to satisfy most. I mean, it's not DRAGON HALF, but then few shows are.Our protagonist is Ihrie, a tomboyish sword fighter who due to a curse inflicted on her years ago is unable to use magic, at least not without a price. (You find out exactly what the curse is in episode 2. Let's just say it's simular to Ranma Soutome's.) To make up for this short coming, she brings with her Fam, a ditzy wiggen (half human, half cat creature) who draws her power from the spirits but often blunders in all things, including magic preforming. They are on a quest for the fabeled Ultimate Power, which could supposedly grant the lucky finder whatever s/he desiers. Ihrie and Fam soon run into another team of ruin explorers-Ragna, another sorceress who has a secret phobia of mice, and her arrogant swordsman partner, who start off as rivals but eventually form an uneasy alliance with our heroines. They are joined by a slimey merchant/con artist, and Lyle, a former prince whose kingdom was wiped out by an evil wizard and who has embarked on a quest for revenge.The only thing that knocks this down by one star is the ending. Read no further if you hate spoilers. Well, lets just say that I thought Ihrie was supposed to be the main hero, but in the final battle she ultimately didn't seem to really do anything useful, despite her efforts. Also, I wasn't really clear exactly on whether she ever got her curse removed or not.Anyway, this one is highly recommended.",4,"Great, short anime, but the ending's a bit disapointing.",1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,1716,"['O.K.', 'here', 'story', 'set', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'adventurers', 'go', 'exploring', 'ruins', 'searching', 'treasure', 'magical', 'items', 'can', 'find', 'D', 'amp', 'D', 'game', 'played', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'throw', 'off', 'enough', 'action', 'comedy', 'satisfy', 'most', 'mean', 'not', 'DRAGON', 'HALF', 'then', 'few', 'shows', 'are.Our', 'protagonist', 'Ihrie', 'tomboyish', 'sword', 'fighter', 'who', 'curse', 'inflicted', 'years', 'ago', 'unable', 'use', 'magic', 'least', 'not', 'price', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'curse', 'episode', '2', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'simular', 'Ranma', 'Soutome', 'make', 'up', 'short', 'coming', 'Fam', 'ditzy', 'wiggen', 'half', 'human', 'half', 'cat', 'creature', 'who', 'power', 'spirits', 'often', 'blunders', 'things', 'including', 'magic', 'preforming', 'are', 'quest', 'fabeled', 'Ultimate', 'Power', 'could', 'supposedly', 'grant', 'lucky', 'finder', 's/he', 'desiers', 'Ihrie', 'Fam', 'soon', 'run', 'team', 'ruin', 'explorers-Ragna', 'sorceress', 'who', 'secret', 'phobia', 'mice', 'arrogant', 'swordsman', 'partner', 'who', 'start', 'off', 'rivals', 'eventually', 'form', 'uneasy', 'alliance', 'heroines', 'are', 'joined', 'slimey', 'merchant/con', 'artist', 'Lyle', 'former', 'prince', 'kingdom', 'was', 'wiped', 'out', 'evil', 'wizard', 'who', 'embarked', 'quest', 'revenge.The', 'only', 'thing', 'down', 'one', 'star', 'ending', 'Read', 'further', 'hate', 'spoilers', 'Well', 'just', 'say', 'thought', 'Ihrie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'hero', 'final', 'battle', 'ultimately', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'useful', 'efforts', 'Also', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'clear', 'exactly', 'ever', 'got', 'curse', 'removed', 'not.Anyway', 'one', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

All of the reasons are described in some way or another.  I don't want to give anything away.  Then comes the &quot;bad-guy&quot;, with reasons of his own.

Anyway, Ruin Explorers is compared to a lot of shows, but ultimately this is an OAV so the scope is not going to be as amazing as Slayers for instance.  On the other hand, being an OAV it had a lot of attention paid to solid animation and it has a nice story line to it, that is short but enjoyable.  The two main characters are lovable but certainly full of comic relief in their own right, and they do a good job to keep the show interesting.  At the end of the day, if you're looking to check out something new, or rather a little old in this case, I don't think you can go wrong with picking this up.
