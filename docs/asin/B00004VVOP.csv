552921,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00004VVOP,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[7, 8]","I bought this anime years ago, and I'm still unsure of what to think about it. It was one of the first anime I ever bought for my shiny new DVD player, and I've only watched it twice since that time.The story itself is of a cop named John Blade who recently lost his partner to a strange, biochemically enhanced monster. Now, he must seek out the few clues to his partner's death while also dealing with the kidnappings of young girls. Joining him is the beautiful sister of the dead partner. Together, as they fight off the biochemical golems, they discover that a woman known as Alexis Sinclaire is responsible for these creatures. Essentially, Sin is a Frankenstein story, as the creatures are very similar in design, only these golems are placed in the 21st century with a very clear mission, which is to kill.Now, I know it's not the animation I don't like about it. That's pretty good, with the exception of some of the CG, which is bad at times. What I think, now that I'm writing this, is that nothing here is unique in any form of entertainment. The characters are walking cliches (tough cop, victim of the antagonist, and overlord-like bad guy). The story, though it has some unique elements to it, can be seen in bad American horror movies. It just isn't something that has to be seen.With that said, I can't truly recommend this title. It brings nothing to anime, and compares to just about anything, whether it's an anime or American movies.",2,Huh?,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,1454,"['bought', 'anime', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'still', 'unsure', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'anime', 'ever', 'bought', 'shiny', 'new', 'DVD', 'player', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'twice', 'time.The', 'story', 'cop', 'named', 'John', 'Blade', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'partner', 'strange', 'biochemically', 'enhanced', 'monster', 'Now', 'must', 'seek', 'out', 'few', 'clues', 'partner', 'death', 'also', 'dealing', 'kidnappings', 'young', 'girls', 'Joining', 'beautiful', 'sister', 'dead', 'partner', 'Together', 'fight', 'off', 'biochemical', 'golems', 'discover', 'woman', 'known', 'Alexis', 'Sinclaire', 'responsible', 'creatures', 'Essentially', 'Sin', 'Frankenstein', 'story', 'creatures', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'design', 'only', 'golems', 'are', 'placed', '21st', 'century', 'very', 'clear', 'mission', 'kill.Now', 'know', 'not', 'animation', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'pretty', 'good', 'exception', 'CG', 'bad', 'times', 'What', 'think', 'now', ""'m"", 'writing', 'nothing', 'here', 'unique', 'form', 'entertainment', 'characters', 'are', 'walking', 'cliches', 'tough', 'cop', 'victim', 'antagonist', 'overlord-like', 'bad', 'guy', 'story', 'unique', 'elements', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'bad', 'American', 'horror', 'movies', 'just', ""n't"", 'something', 'be', 'seen.With', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'recommend', 'title', 'nothing', 'anime', 'just', 'anything', 'anime', 'American', 'movies']",N/A

Ream ""xdelusion""","[1, 3]","Ok, so it isn't Vampire Hunter D, Akira, Wicked City, or the like, then again, this isn't the 80's, and not EVERY anime is going to be a classic anymore. It's grown into a huge industry, and not there us just a LOT more, and with all things such as Hollywood and the Music Industry, concepts and aspects begin to be used like jig-saw puzzle pieces, and you'll begin to see movies that barrow concepts from other Anime's to tell it's tell. Not everyone is a Katsuhiro tomo, get over it. What IS important, is the story. The character developement, the gore, the drama, the action, and quality anime. In ALL of these departments it does VERY well. Granted, it had a few cheesey moments, but I'd say that 96% of the film was enjoyable, and moved right along without boring me.Matter of fact, for those of you who have beat the game, fear not, they change things around in the story so it's an all new experience.Anyhow, check it out, it ain't too bad, definatly worth at least $8.00.

A Huffman ""haumf""","[8, 9]","Loosely based on the PC game (a pretty good game), Sin is the story of a cop in the future who stumbles upon a plot by an evil scientist to turn everybody into monsters. Why? Because that's what evil scientists do dummy! And of course they are after an innocent little girl too since they are always the &quot;key to their master plan&quot;.The animation is a fair, the violence is nice and gory (I liked the monsters) but Sin is missing something. It has that &quot;rushed out the door&quot; feel.

552927,A2O0CFU9Q9XK3,B00004VVOP,"""madnessmark""","[1, 2]","Based on the PC game, Sin is the story of Blade who helps a girl. This movie looked really good, but then came the defaults. First off, the guy known as JC dies and is then replaced with his sister uncleverly named JC. Then the CG. The CG isn't horrible like Panzer Dragoon, but I can tell these guys weren't taking notes on the CG in Cowboy Bebop or Blue Sub No. 6. Even the 2D animation is horrible. And then theres the story. The story goes fairly well until the ending. This is the worst ending I have ever scene in an anime and I've seen a lot. The only reason I gave Sin 2 stars instead of one is for the dub, which brilliantly done, but doesn't make up for the laging story and bad animation. Fans of the PC game might get a mild kick out of it, but otaku won't.
