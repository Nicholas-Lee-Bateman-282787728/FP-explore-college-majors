824376,A2CAW4NKVFY6I7,B00024I2VI,cohrun,"[2, 3]","If you're going to buy a children's video, this a great video for toddlers.  I recommend it over other kids' videos because it is fun, not too fast-paced or cartoon animated, and the puppets are really cute.  My kids liked it.Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to babies.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely not for babies' brains.After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",3,AAP recommends no tv before 2,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,1899,"[""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'children', 'video', 'great', 'video', 'toddlers', 'recommend', 'other', 'kids', 'videos', 'fun', 'not', 'too', 'fast-paced', 'cartoon', 'animated', 'puppets', 'are', 'really', 'cute', 'kids', 'liked', 'it.Having', 'said', 'have', 'beef', 'title', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'marketing', 'babies', 'imply', 'watching', 'videos', 'good', 'babies', 'are', 'NOT', 'videos', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'older', 'kids', 'definitely', 'not', 'babies', 'brains.After', 'research', 'found', 'out', '1', 'brain', 'wave', 'activity', 'babies', 'slower', 'when', 'watching', 'television', 'when', 'sleeping', '2', 'hour', 'television', 'baby', 'day', 'chances', 'acquiring', 'attention', 'deficit', 'disorder', 'increases', '10', '%', '3', 'hour', 'television', 'viewed', 'daily', '4', 'yrs', 'old', 'significant', 'odds', 'increase', 'being', 'bully', 'later', '4', 'consistent', 'heavy', 'television', 'viewing', 'more', '2', 'hrs', 'daily', 'early', 'childhood', 'can', 'cause', 'behavior', 'sleep', 'attention', 'problems.The', 'American', 'Academy', 'Pediatrics', 'television', 'children', '2', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'media', 'tv', 'videos', 'video', 'games', 'computers', 'daily', 'age', '2', 'think', 'important', 'parents', 'caregivers', 'be', 'aware', 'can', 'make', 'better', 'informed', 'choices', 'hope', 'people', 'limit', 'television', 'usage', 'babies', 'look', 'other', 'outlets', 'when', 'possible.For', 'looking', 'calm', 'babies', 'build', 'better', 'brains', 'recommend', 'baby', 'carriers', 'studies', 'show', 'infants', 'who', 'are', 'carried', 'extra', '3', 'hours', 'day', 'cry', '40', '%', 'less', 'effect', 'lasting', 'time', 'Frequently', 'held', 'babies', 'pick', 'up', 'verbal', 'skills', 'faster', 'develop', 'better', 'core', 'muscle', 'strength', 'balance', 'Also', 'learning', 'communicate', 'sign', 'language', 'can', 'reduce', 'frustration', 'tantrums', 'accelerate', 'language', 'development', 'promote', 'parent-child', 'bonding', 'infants', 'toddlers']",Baby Einstein - Baby Da Vinci - From Head to Toe

Will it teach your child anything? Very doubtful! One of my big BE complaints is that they don't reinforce the spoken word with the images. They say the word once in three languages, and THEN show pictures, so there's no continuity between word and object. BEs other major flaw is that they show images only tangentially related to the concept they are presenting (such as showing the game Mouse Trap to introduce 'Mouse', how many babies are going to get that?)The puppet shows also tend to contain content that babies won't get, such as an elephant sneezing because another elephant put pepper on a flower.
