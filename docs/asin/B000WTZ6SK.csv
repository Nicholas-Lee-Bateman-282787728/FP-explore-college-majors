They yanked it around so much you never knew when it was going to air.This was one of my favorite shows as a kid.  Its nice to be able to see it again.The first season was a bit more realistic but this season was fun.  I've always been a fan of Roy Scheider.  As well as a fan of Jonathan Brandis ever since I saw NESII.I can not wait for the release of season three because I haven't seen any of those episodes at all.  I just hope it doesn't take Universal another two years to release it.For me its a better show than what's on T.V. now.

Why Universal took so long to get this season out is a mystery to me. I've been ready to buy it since before season 1 came out.As you may recall, the first season of seaQuest ended with the destruction of the supersubmarine, to save the world from what can arguably be called catastrophic global warming.  As the season begins, Captain Bridger is taking command of the new seaQuest. The bridge has been redesigned, as have several other parts of the boat, but the biggest difference in season 2 is the new crewmembers. Sadly, we lose the comical Krieg, the uptight Hitchcock, the country boy Crocker, and the cerebral but attractive Dr. Westphalen.  However, their loss is not so badly felt with the arrival of new crewmen - Lt. Brody, combat veteran. Dagwood, a failed prototype for a naturally camouflaged supersoldier. Henderson the attractive and young new techie with no experience. Dr. Wendy Smith, a telepathic (this was hinted at in season 1's ""Treasure of the Mind"") medical doctor and scientist (though not quite in Westphalen's league). And rounding out the Rogue's Gallery is Tony Piccolo, a wise-cracking ex-con on work-release aboard seaQuest, with the gills of a fish in his torso (""I'm a surfer. I thought they might come in handy."").The second season has a somewhat different feel to it than the first, which was fairly science-only. This season, the show takes on a bit more of a sci-fi feel to it, but this is not a bad thing.After the 2-hour season premiere of the Dagger (others like Dagwood) Revolt, the aliens seen in season 1's ""Such Great Patience"" arrive to a mixed reception. Later episodes in the season depict the possible discovery of the location of long-lost Atlantis, a renegade robot submarine programmed with Capt. Bridger's personality, and Star Wars fans are treated to two guest appearances by Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill!  Kent McCord also returns 3 times this season, reprising his role as Space Commander Scott Keller.The ending of this season, I don't want to give away in case newer fans haven't seen it, but I will say that Universal BETTER release season 3!seaQuest was a great sci-fi series, far ahead of its time in the early 1990's. I have no doubt that these days, it would be going popular. I plan to spend many hours enjoying this season! :)",5,seaQuest DSV - Season Two  .  .  .

Rockne O'Bannon (Farscape: Complete Series [Blu-ray]), Peter DeLuise (Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection), and Steven Spielberg ($$) are credited with contributing to this season. Not even the charisma and talent of Roy Scheider could balance out the erratic, sometimes awful scripts handed to the other actors. Bad lines and questionable plots certainly contributed to the mediocrity of this season, but there is plenty of blame to go around.The show couldn't decide what it was, and when pushing boundaries it often just went off a cliff.The aliens in the episode ""The Fear That Follows"" shuffle around like distressed mimes, less convincing even than the spacemen from the filmTeenagers from Outer Space(1959). This is followed by a prescient yet pedestrian episode that preaches about how computers (especially computer games) will become so important that people will stop relating to one another in the flesh.Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker!) guest stars as a professor / alien hybrid (because that makes sense) in ""Dream Weaver,"" but the episode was so bad that I didn't even care about the fate of my once-favorite actor's character.Oh, and while I have nothing against sea mammals, there is a talking dolphin onscreen far too often, which shatters any pretense of serious drama that SeaQuest might have been trying to pull off. Maybe this actually was a good show in 1994, but it certainly didn't age well.Yet despite all this, there was usually something charming in each episode that kept me wanting to take a chance that the next episode would be worth my time. The acting is generally fine (aside from Dagwood's ""gentle giant"" persona being overplayed to the point of a 4-yr-old), and there is almost enough ""sci-fi"" in the season to keep aficionados engaged. The short little bits during the closing credits where SeaQuest actors take turns throwing some facts at you about sea animals is still a nice way to end each episode.

First of all the characters that are in season one were better than season 2. There is no Hitchcock and her amazing eyes. This season were treated with psychic smith with big boobs, who walks around in the opener showing off her goods, but then as the season progresses it some how vanishes and she becomes almost uncomfortable in her role. The only eye candy in this season is LT. Henderson, and maybe a few shower scenes with smith. Henderson has a few good moments in several episodes where she's walkng around in tube tops, or tight jeans. I'm a guy and sex appeal is a must..My biggest prob with season 2 is most of the characters are annoying and douchey. Wasn't a fan of brody, the general, or Ted Raimi(can't think of his seaquest name). Piccolo was annoying, but was the only cool smartass one on seaquest. Also didn't care for the daggers or some of the very strange missions this season went on over season one.I would have preferred some on screen relationships. I mean they are on tour and on a sub and there isn't anything going on? They touched very lightly with raimi and henderson, and even bridger and smith, and lucas with his 24hr love interest. I mean come on, have something going on, instead of an hr long borefest about the mission at hand.Lucas is cool but at times is over dramatic, but I noticed that in a few of his other roles in his other movies, he's always over dramatic. Cpt Bridger is ok too. Not much diff than the 1st season.I was happy they did away with the DR ballard clip facts at the end of every episode.

This is one of those series that is a hidden gem that somehow I missed when it was on back in the early 90's. If you are a fan of science fiction or even just a fan of Roy Schieder then you will enjoy this series.I think I saw another reviewer say something like this is Star Trek under water and I have to say that's a really accurate description. There is a great deal of the human element involved in these episodes and there is a ecological undertone to many episodes as well expressed with an attitude of innocence that is rather charming.Perhaps one other part of this series that struck a chord with me is what I would call the ""Galaxy Quest"" intro. I thought Galaxy Quest was a very good parody and now having seen the introduction to Seaqust DSV I know that they weren't just parodying Star Trek, but this series as well.There is much to watch here and the efforts of many good people to watch as well. Stephen Speilberg, Roy Scheider and a great supporting case are a few that should be mentioned. It was even a pleasant surprise to see Dom DeLuise in one episode(and his sons in many others).

The season two finale, where Seaquest takes a very, very long trip, is missing.  I do not know if this is because they wanted to combine it with season three, to give the final season more meat, or if they just decided not to include it for other reasons.  Regardless, it is a significant loss.One other thought, and I encourage others to speculate on it.  Marco Sanchez returns in this season.  In the first season he played a squared-away, regulation haircut Navy rating always in a pressed uniform, and looking sharp.  This season, he has a bit more of a ruffian look, with long curly locks and a face that looks more unshaven that not. Which is okay since this is all fiction, anyway.  But the thing that made me blink is that I remember from watching the show on TV that Sanchez had the most outrageous and impractical 'do, especially for a military vessel, rather than the free-flowing locks sported in these disks.

Someone should do a thesis on why these movie giants fail in the transition to the small screen so often...but I digress...the second season of Seaquest is just as entertaining as the first and still found no audience beyond the teeny-boppers (is that still a viable term?) who flocked around Jonathan Brandis and kept the whole sub afloat for a couple of seasons.  But all that aside I liked it then...I like it now.  Well produced (how could it not be) and family oriented it should have had smooth sailing but by the end of this second season was floundering on the rocks with well publicized 'creative' differences surfacing between Roy and the producers (including Mr. S.).  By the final season (which I would like to see released on DVD before I die) the whole direction and focus had changed and Scheider was gone and along with it the direction the whole series had begun with. The focus was more on action in the third.  This review is almost as convoluted as the series had become but reviewing the series almost forces that result.  Bottom line.  It's a classy show that should have done better and didn't but is still entertaining and worth watching.  This season lets Brandis move forward a bit and Scheider is a great moral center.  It also lets the crew begin to shine as we've become accustomed to their individual personalities by now and several stories focus on them to good effect.

The result is a relatively slow moving show with simple plots.  The actors are solid and Roy Schieder particularly shines as Captain Bridger.  I wish the producers had believed more in the intelligence of their audience.  At the price charged by Amazon, it is worth purchasing and viewing if you are a die-hard science fiction fan.  The disks I received are single-sided, by the way.  One irony is that the newly introduced mentally-challenged character played by Peter DeLuise is more perceptive and better at solving problems than the officers of the crew!
