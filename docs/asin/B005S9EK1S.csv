1499774,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B005S9EK1S,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[0, 0]","Zac Efron impresses once again. First it was inCharlie St. Cloudand now this to an even greater extent. The film was all-around great. The actors all did a pretty good job. But I was extremely impressed with Zac's character as the detached war survivor. This is the first role that I've seen him play someone sooo serious!!! He didn't smile that much in the movie and for some reason I don't think that reflects who Zac is as a person at all. He really did play the hell out of this part!The movie itself was made up of a lot of romance, some drama and a few pinches of life lessons all mixed in one. I really enjoyed the scenery, the characters and the roles they played and much of the music. It all tied together quite well. I especially loved the fact that Zac's character wound up at a place that takes care of and trains dogs. That was really special to me as they are my favorite pet ever!I know I haven't said all that much about the movie specifically (I really don't like those reviews that spoil the whole thing for you!) but like I've said before I'm like 5x better at writing reviews for music.Overall, this is probably the best movie I've seen all year! So definitely take into consideration that this review in no way, shape or form does this beautiful movie justice. After watching it I think this movie is rated PG-13; there is some swearing and very minor nudity (Zac's butt is shown in the nude for like 3 seconds) but other than that it's a pretty clean movie. Along withThe Last SongI have to pick this movie up.

What you might expect is what you'll get here:  romance, struggle, resolution.  I'm giving four stars because that's what it is to me in the genre of sweet-mindless-romance-I-watch-when-I'm-exhausted/stressed/bored.  I didn't read the book, so I can't say anything about how true the adaptation is.  The movie moves slowly enough that you don't need to give it your full attention, which is helpful in a busy house.  Be careful, though, to not watch it with littlies about as there are a couple of steamy scenes.  One note:  I rented the HD version of this via Amazon Instant Video and had a couple of blank screen issues, causing me to stop the video and try to find my place again, which was slightly annoying.

Ok so now for the review, this is literally one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life, and i watch movies daily, yes i am a teenager who thinks Zac Efron is a total hunk and would honestly make watching a documentary on the life-cycle of a grasshopper interesting but still this movie is perfection. I believe they cast the perfect people for every character, although i did picture Ben a little differently i got used to him and ended up loving him by the end. They did make a lot of changes from the book to the movie like why he went to find beth, the ending, and the picture but i believe they pulled off every single change they made perfectly. I was so engrossed in the movie there was a part where i almost started clapping but stopped myself before i did cause i was in the audience of the theater and the the church. I cried about 5 times, yes i am a baby in movies, but they were mainly tears of happiness and that is how i know if a movie is good, they developed the characters so well that i got teary eyed when like touching things happened with Beth and her son,Beth and Logan, and also Beth and her brother.

It wasn't the same chemistry I saw in the Notebook for example, Goslin and Rachel were rather intense and believable, specially after the heavy rain in the boat, kind of a coincidence that it have a similar ""getting wet"" way in this movie as well. Zach is believable in his role and loveable, but I don't know, I didn't see any spark.

1499790,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B005S9EK1S,Andre Dursin,"[1, 1]","BLU-RAY REVIEW: While I haven't been a big admirer of most of the films adapted from Nicholas Sparks books, there's just something appealing about ""The Lucky One,"" a well-made adaptation of one of Sparks' countless romantic tomes from ""Shine"" director Scott Hicks.Zac Efron is much better than anticipated here as a U.S. army vet, trying to readjust to life after three tours of duty in Iraq, who sets out to find his ""guardian angel"": a torn photograph of a lovely young blonde that he found in the rubble during combat. Efron's journey takes him to a gorgeous Louisiana seaside community (mistakenly listed as North Carolina on the disc's packaging) where the girl turns out to be a divorced mom (Taylor Schilling) trying to recuperate on her own from the death of her brother and her fractured relationship with an abrasive ex-husband (Jay R. Ferguson). The two forge an immediate relationship but her emotional issues and the presence of her ex threaten both of their futures.""The Lucky One"" provides few surprises - this is basically a standard romantic drama not unlike any Hallmark Channel original movie - but what makes the film work is the overall quality of the filmmaking and its appealing performances. Efron and Schilling generate an awful lot of chemistry together here, and both provide likeable characterizations that make it easy for viewers to pull for them. What's more, Hicks' fine lensing - complete with color-drenched cinematography by Alar Kivilo - raises the material a notch above most of the prior Sparks films, while Mark Isham's truly superb score (sadly unreleased as of yet) adds a further emotional layer to the entire picture. Though no classic, as ""date movies"" and recent romantic dramas go, ""The Lucky One"" is one of the best I've seen in some time.Warner brings ""The Lucky One"" to Blu-Ray in the form of a combo pack also offering a DVD and Ultraviolet copy. Extra features are fairly lightweight here, comprised of three featuretes, while the disc technically is capped by a splendid 1080p transfer that really makes the visuals sing along with a 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack.",4,Charming Romantic Drama with Solid Chemistry Between the Leads,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,2108,"['BLU-RAY', 'REVIEW', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'big', 'admirer', 'most', 'films', 'adapted', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'books', 'just', 'something', 'appealing', 'Lucky', 'One', 'well-made', 'adaptation', 'one', 'Sparks', 'countless', 'romantic', 'tomes', 'Shine', 'director', 'Scott', 'Hicks.Zac', 'Efron', 'much', 'better', 'anticipated', 'here', 'U.S.', 'army', 'vet', 'trying', 'readjust', 'life', 'three', 'tours', 'duty', 'Iraq', 'who', 'out', 'find', 'guardian', 'angel', 'torn', 'photograph', 'lovely', 'young', 'blonde', 'found', 'rubble', 'combat', 'Efron', 'journey', 'gorgeous', 'Louisiana', 'seaside', 'community', 'mistakenly', 'listed', 'North', 'Carolina', 'disc', 'packaging', 'where', 'girl', 'out', 'be', 'divorced', 'mom', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'trying', 'recuperate', 'own', 'death', 'brother', 'fractured', 'relationship', 'abrasive', 'ex-husband', 'Jay', 'R.', 'Ferguson', 'two', 'forge', 'immediate', 'relationship', 'emotional', 'issues', 'presence', 'ex', 'threaten', 'futures', 'Lucky', 'One', 'few', 'surprises', 'basically', 'standard', 'romantic', 'drama', 'not', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'original', 'movie', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'overall', 'quality', 'filmmaking', 'appealing', 'performances', 'Efron', 'Schilling', 'generate', 'awful', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'together', 'here', 'provide', 'likeable', 'characterizations', 'make', 'easy', 'viewers', 'pull', 'What', 'more', 'Hicks', 'fine', 'lensing', 'complete', 'color-drenched', 'cinematography', 'Alar', 'Kivilo', 'material', 'notch', 'most', 'prior', 'Sparks', 'films', 'Mark', 'Isham', 'truly', 'superb', 'score', 'sadly', 'unreleased', 'yet', 'further', 'emotional', 'layer', 'entire', 'picture', 'classic', 'date', 'movies', 'recent', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'go', 'Lucky', 'One', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time.Warner', 'Lucky', 'One', 'Blu-Ray', 'form', 'combo', 'pack', 'also', 'offering', 'DVD', 'Ultraviolet', 'copy', 'Extra', 'features', 'are', 'fairly', 'lightweight', 'here', 'comprised', 'three', 'featuretes', 'disc', 'technically', 'capped', 'splendid', '1080p', 'transfer', 'really', 'visuals', 'sing', 'along', '5.1', 'DTS', 'MA', 'soundtrack']",The Lucky One

As the lights came up as the credits rolled, I turned around to see myself standing among fifteen to twenty women, some were teared up, some weren't. Nicholas Sparks, the writer of the novel, has made a career off of books and movies that touch people's hearts. The biggest of those was ""The Notebook"", but ""A Walk to Remember"" & ""Message in a Bottle"" were notable as well.While most of Spark's novels are tailor made for women, I found ""The Notebook"" to be something that everything could relate to with its theme of Alzheimer's. ""The Lucky One"" on the other hand, had many opportunities to reach a broader audience but brush stroked over those. I enjoyed ""The Lucky One"", but for some reason, it didn't quite affect me like ""The Notebook"" did. That may be because it didn't spend enough time in certain areas.First of all, Zac Effron (High School Musical, 17 Again) plays Logan, a survivor of Iraqi freedom who stumbles upon a picture of Beth (Taylor Schilling) lying in a pile of rocks after a night raid. All we learn about Logan happens in the length of the opening credits. The problem with ""The Lucky One"" may just have been that the characters were all too interesting. There is depth to the characters, but the montages that are used to get all the information across are empty and unexplored. Sparks also did a movie called ""Dear John"" that had so many montages, I thought I was watching a two-hour commercial for Hallmark. I hate montages.In the first four minutes of the film, we see Logan survive some war situations, see him return home with a picture that saved his life and see that he has a lot of post-traumatic stress. All of which is very interesting, but it happens in a montage and we lose all the emotion from it.  Once the movie gets going though, to its credit, we start to see some real emotions coming out, especially from Schilling's character. She does an outstanding job portraying her sadness and her struggles as a single mother dealing with a lot of issues. Effron, on the other hand, is stuck playing a character that had his best parts portrayed in montage and for the rest of the movie, plays the perfect man. What else would you expect?""The Lucky One"" is just an okay movie that gives everybody that enjoys these type movies exactly what they're looking for. It has two beautiful people falling in love. It has drama. It has beautiful cinematography. It has all the clich&eacute;' things that make a movie like this safe from criticism and just outside the realm of memorable. As rich as the characters were, I just wish some of those character traits would have been fleshed out more.",3,Montage Sparks and the perfect man,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,2746,"['Being', 'only', 'male', 'audience', 'Friday', 'afternoon', 'pretty', 'much', 'tells', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'Lucky', 'One', 'lights', 'came', 'up', 'credits', 'rolled', 'turned', 'around', 'see', 'standing', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'women', 'were', 'teared', 'up', 'were', ""n't"", 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'writer', 'novel', 'made', 'career', 'books', 'movies', 'touch', 'people', 'hearts', 'biggest', 'was', 'Notebook', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'were', 'notable', 'well.While', 'most', 'Spark', 'novels', 'are', 'tailor', 'made', 'women', 'found', 'Notebook', 'be', 'something', 'everything', 'could', 'relate', 'theme', 'Alzheimer', 'Lucky', 'One', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'many', 'opportunities', 'reach', 'broader', 'audience', 'brush', 'stroked', 'enjoyed', 'Lucky', 'One', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'affect', 'Notebook', 'did', 'may', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'certain', 'areas.First', 'Zac', 'Effron', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', '17', 'Again', 'Logan', 'survivor', 'Iraqi', 'freedom', 'who', 'picture', 'Beth', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'lying', 'pile', 'rocks', 'night', 'raid', 'learn', 'Logan', 'length', 'opening', 'credits', 'problem', 'Lucky', 'One', 'may', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'interesting', 'depth', 'characters', 'montages', 'are', 'used', 'get', 'information', 'are', 'empty', 'unexplored', 'Sparks', 'also', 'did', 'movie', 'called', 'Dear', 'John', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'montages', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'two-hour', 'commercial', 'Hallmark', 'hate', 'first', 'four', 'minutes', 'film', 'see', 'Logan', 'survive', 'war', 'situations', 'see', 'return', 'home', 'picture', 'saved', 'life', 'see', 'lot', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'very', 'interesting', 'montage', 'lose', 'emotion', 'movie', 'going', 'credit', 'start', 'see', 'real', 'emotions', 'coming', 'out', 'especially', 'Schilling', 'character', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'sadness', 'struggles', 'single', 'mother', 'dealing', 'lot', 'issues', 'Effron', 'other', 'hand', 'stuck', 'playing', 'character', 'had', 'best', 'parts', 'portrayed', 'montage', 'rest', 'movie', 'perfect', 'man', 'What', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'Lucky', 'One', 'just', 'okay', 'movie', 'everybody', 'type', 'movies', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'two', 'beautiful', 'people', 'falling', 'love', 'drama', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'clich', 'eacute', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'safe', 'criticism', 'just', 'realm', 'memorable', 'As', 'rich', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'wish', 'character', 'traits', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more']",The Lucky One

I like to think of it as sci-fi for the &#34;chick flick&#34; scene.  Of course, as a guy of 6'6&#34; I can admit that I like a good chick flick from time to time and not worry about getting beat up over it.  Here in &#34;The Lucky One&#34; we have our Prince Charming played by a Marine named Logan (Zac Efron) who is looking for a girl in a photograph (Taylor Schilling) that he found in a combat zone.The very fact that he stopped to pick up the photo saved his life as his buddies just ahead of him lost their lives in an explosion.  He keeps the picture with him, attributing his good luck to having it on him throughout the rest of his tour.  When he goes home he wants to find the girl even though he has no information on her at all, and because it is a Nicholas Sparks story it turns out to be pretty darn easy for him as a patron in a bar tells him the picture is of a woman named Beth that runs the dog kennel down the road..Of course, when he finds her he chickens out and doesn't tell her why he is there.  Instead, he takes a job at the kennel that she and her mother (Blythe Danner) run.  It's then he gets to know the woman, he finds out she is divorced with a young son.  The ex-husband also happens to be the local law and gives Logan all sorts of trouble and threatens Beth that he's going to take custody of their son away from her if she dates him.The movie can be a bit predictable at times, but there are enough twists and turns to elevate this above a paint-by-numbers romance.

I think the script was just too cheesy and predictable at times and the acting and directing was not enough to compensate and carry the viewer through it without noticing, but still who doesn't want our returning soldiers to win both there and after returning home - especially U.S. Marine Sergeant Logan Thibault returning from his third tour of duty in Iraq when most of his buddies did not and has to answer the tough question of why is he the lucky one to survive.  Could it be his guardian angel pictured in the photograph he found?Dealing with PTSD and the struggle of truly realizing he is not living in death-risking enemy territory any longer, Logan decides to walk from Colorado to Hampton, North Carolina in search of his lucky charm/angel.  Learning her name is Beth (Schilling) and where she lives, he shows up at her door, and ends up taking a job at her family-run local kennel. She has her own demons with whom she struggles: the death of her marine brother who lost her photograph, raising a son on her own from a high school pregnancy with an over-controlling baby-daddy, death of both of her parents, and trying to help her aging grandmother run the pet hotel despite her recent stroke.  Despite both Logan's and Beth's numerous trials and tribulations, they are both so kind and nice and responsible people that you just have to root for them to conquer those demons and find each other and find love.It is all too cliche and predictable but yet so relevant and dealing with many of our country's tough problems.  I lovedThe Lucky One (Movie only+UltraViolet) [Blu-ray]. It was like working out your problems with a long slow walk in the beautiful countryside with great country to unwind and leave your troubles behind in.

Scott Hicks, 2012, 101 minutes, based on the novel) is very easy on the eyes and only a bit hairier on the emotions. What you would expect from a Zac Efron movie. Efron plays Logan, a Marine sergeant who's finished three tours of duty. At the start of his final tour, he and his men suffer an ambush, after which he finds a photo of a beautiful blonde (Taylor Schilling who is charming). He considers it his own lucky charm after he attempts to find its owner.Fast forward to Zac out of the military and staying with his sister and her family. Thanks to a unique lighthouse in the background of the photo, Zac locates the town where he thinks the girl lives - and he is right. She owns a pet daycare, mistakes him for a job seeker and soon Zac is working for the girl and her grandmother.The usual you might expect is all here, romance blossoms, I won't give away anymore. It was pleasant enough to watch an 'honest' romance, with little swearing (done by Zac when he was still in the war) and thankfully no real violence. One thing that really grates like hell on my nerves is this insistence on making every damned thing a music video. One song at the beginning and one at the end is the full extent this should be allowed to go. But no ... every other film has to have ridiculous music in every scene.It was surprising to view a film by Hicks without any of the magic/innovation of his other work, such as, say,Hearts in Atlantis(see my review) or the soft stylishness ofSnow Falling on Cedars. It seems fine for a TV film or a Hallmark movie - which is what I generally call these types of things - but as I said, it's as easy on the eyes as Zac. It could be considered a family movie, but it has no actual point.Really, absolutely no point other than to show off Zac Efron as per usual. While he's all grown and he can act, and even shows a little skin now and then, I wonder what is the point of allowing him to do anymore movies. It strikes me he always plays the same character. Stick him by the lake, put him on a farm, or yank him out of the war: he's always Zac Efron. And that gets stale fast. Truly, we have no right to complain about Channing Tatum, whom I deeply adore, when we are also dropping dollars to see Zac Efron movies.That is not Zac's fault, and I have generally enjoyed the films he makes, though I was slightly irritated by his weird paranormal movieCharlie St. Cloud(in which he actually fit in just a bit better, see my review). What I want now is to see Zac grow some real ones, make a film in which he is gay, possibly a prostitute and slightly drug-addled. I want to see specifically Zac Efron play a gay man who struggles his way up from the muck. Don't ask why, but I want that.I'll never be 100% approving of him until he does this.",3,Zac's eyelashes should be kissed every hour on the hour,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,2788,"['LUCKY', 'ONE', 'Dir', 'Scott', 'Hicks', '2012', '101', 'minutes', 'based', 'novel', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'only', 'bit', 'hairier', 'emotions', 'What', 'would', 'expect', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'movie', 'Efron', 'Logan', 'Marine', 'sergeant', 'who', 'finished', 'three', 'tours', 'duty', 'start', 'final', 'tour', 'men', 'suffer', 'ambush', 'photo', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'who', 'charming', 'own', 'lucky', 'charm', 'find', 'owner.Fast', 'forward', 'Zac', 'military', 'staying', 'sister', 'family', 'Thanks', 'unique', 'lighthouse', 'background', 'photo', 'Zac', 'town', 'where', 'girl', 'right', 'pet', 'daycare', 'job', 'seeker', 'soon', 'Zac', 'working', 'girl', 'grandmother.The', 'usual', 'might', 'expect', 'here', 'romance', 'blossoms', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'anymore', 'was', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'watch', ""'honest"", 'romance', 'little', 'swearing', 'done', 'Zac', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'war', 'thankfully', 'real', 'violence', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'hell', 'nerves', 'insistence', 'making', 'damned', 'thing', 'music', 'video', 'One', 'song', 'beginning', 'one', 'end', 'full', 'extent', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'go', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'ridiculous', 'music', 'scene.It', 'was', 'surprising', 'view', 'film', 'Hicks', 'magic/innovation', 'other', 'work', 'such', 'say', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'see', 'review', 'soft', 'stylishness', 'ofSnow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'fine', 'TV', 'film', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'what', 'generally', 'call', 'types', 'things', 'said', 'easy', 'eyes', 'Zac', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'family', 'movie', 'actual', 'point.Really', 'absolutely', 'point', 'other', 'show', 'off', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'usual', 'grown', 'can', 'act', 'even', 'little', 'skin', 'now', 'then', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', 'allowing', 'do', 'anymore', 'movies', 'always', 'same', 'character', 'Stick', 'lake', 'put', 'farm', 'yank', 'war', 'always', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'stale', 'fast', 'Truly', 'have', 'right', 'complain', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'whom', 'deeply', 'adore', 'when', 'are', 'also', 'dropping', 'dollars', 'see', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'movies.That', 'not', 'Zac', 'fault', 'have', 'generally', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'was', 'slightly', 'irritated', 'weird', 'paranormal', 'movieCharlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'actually', 'fit', 'just', 'bit', 'better', 'see', 'review', 'What', 'want', 'now', 'see', 'Zac', 'grow', 'real', 'ones', 'make', 'film', 'gay', 'possibly', 'prostitute', 'slightly', 'drug-addled', 'want', 'see', 'specifically', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'play', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'way', 'muck', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'want', 'that.I', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', '100', '%', 'approving']",The Lucky One

Sparks is the Sparks Author of romantic stories where the main characters usually don't experience the typical happy ending, characters questioning their Christian belief or faith, and whose stories tend to center around a tragedy.  He sells everything he writes and many of his books are readily adapted into blockbuster movies: The Lucky One, The Notebook, The Last Song, A Walk to Remember, Dear John, Message in a Bottle, and Nights in Rodanthe. Though the stories are repetitive and filled with clich&eacute; phrases such as `How do you explain something that you can't even understand yourself?' they do serve an audience hungry for these kinds of tales.  THE LUCKY ONE won't let those people down.Sgt. Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) is a marine serving in Iraq and we are introduced after some lugubrious footage to the actual war scenes in Iraq where Logan finds a photo of a girl with ""keep safe"" written on the back. He is admiring it when his unit is attacked. He survives and credits the photo for saving him. He tries to find the owner but can't, assuming he was killed. When he goes back to the States, he finds it difficult to adjust and is still haunted by what happened. Analyzing the photo, he finds in the background a landmark that tells him she is in Louisiana. He then goes there and finds her. He learns her name is Beth (Taylor Schilling), a divorced mother of a cute kid Ben (Riley Thomas Stewart) whose loathsome sheriff ex-husband Keith (Jay R. Ferguson), who happens to be the son of the small town Judge Clayton (Adam LeFevre), makes life miserable for Beth. Beth and her grandmother Ellie (Blythe Danner) still mourn the loss of Beth's brother drake who is still `missing in action' in Iraq. Logan tries to tell her what happened but can't get the words out. She assumes he's there to apply for the job they advertised looking for someone to help at her family's business, a dog kennel. He says yes but at first she gets an uneasy feeling from him but Ellie decides to give him a chance. It isn't long that he makes a connection with Ben and his music ability, has confrontations with Keith, and the rest is entirely predictable Sparks-type ending.Will Fetters adapted this one for the screen and Scott Hicks directs with a rather heavy hand on the organ tremolo. Of the cast Blythe Danner gives her usual excellent professionalism. The rest of the cast is according to the tastes of the viewers. Efron apparently beefed up his physique for the role but forgot to beef up the acting. The film could stand a good editing to relieve the ennui.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[71, 87]","I have this subversive image of Nicholas Sparks in a wifebeater at the computer, angrily pounding the keyboards and listening to death metal while a burly biker gives him a tat. Because a guy can't be that wholesome and sensitive, can he? Except that, like clockwork, Sparks' bestselling novels keep getting made into films. THE LUCKY ONE is merely the latest adaptation.This is Hollywood, babe, so we shouldn't harp on them heaps of uncanny coincidences. Such as these: In Iraq, the morning after a harrowing exchange of gunfire with the enemy, U.S. Marine Sergeant Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) gets off his duff and picks up a photo he glimpses lying in the rubble. Suddenly, there's an explosion right where he had been sitting, and that's when the notion probably first struck him that the photo is some sort of lucky charm. Eight months later, Logan's third tour of duty ends and he's going home, that photo still tucked away in his keeping. Logan regards the mysterious girl in the photo as his guardian angel, someone who'd kept him safe and breathing. He wants to find her and thank her. But he doesn't know who she is.Back home, Logan Thibault is unable to settle down, and off he goes with his dog, walking, just walking. In his wanderings, he crosses several states and eventually ends up at a family-run dog kennel in Louisiana. See, he'd never stopped trying to look for that girl in the photo. By pure happenstance, the girl in question, whose name is Beth (Taylor Schilling), runs the kennel and she assumes that Logan has shown up looking for work. And because the plot demands it, Logan rides with the deception.The kennel is this run-down establishment, and Logan quickly makes himself useful, never mind Beth's bitter ex-husband's assertion that he may be a ""crazy drifter."" It shouldn't surprise viewers that THE LUCKY ONE follows the patented Nicholas Sparks formula. The film, lushly romantic and graced with evocative cinematography, reminds me quite a bit, in terms of tone and sheer escapism, ofA Walk in the Clouds. Of course, it makes more sense for Logan to right away inform Beth of why he's really there. But where would the movie be? Taylor Schilling is sweet and appealing, playing a young single mom raising a child while fending off the unwanted affections of her influential ex-husband (who is this bullying deputy sheriff). Beth nurses her own grief. She's yet to come to terms with her brother's death during the war. Logan's military past upsets her and prejudices her against him. Plus, he seems to be everywhere she's at. It's irritating. We all know where this is going. But Nicholas Sparks, with his sweaty wifebeater shirt and his deep aversion to sunlight, is adept at manipulating his audience.Zac Efron surprises me. It's evident that those HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL pictures are increasingly dimming in the rear view. A friend recommended CHARLIE ST. CLOUD to me a while ago, and I laughed at her with the smug convinction of someone who views Zac Efron as someone who belongs strictly in the teeny bopper crowd. But Efron demonstrates reserve and maturity in his portrayal of a troubled jarhead desperate for solace. He plays Logan as a man of serious humor but with hidden depths. I liked him. Blythe Danner comes in as Schilling's wise grandmother. Danner, naturally, exhibits that infallible knack for sensing the right man for her hurting granddaughter. I long for a grandmother like Danner. It surely would save time and effort on them online dating services.A manly man like me can readily admit that he's a romantic cuss. I enjoyed THE LUCKY ONE quite a bit. Nothing in the story surprised me. I looked each plot swerve (not many) squarely in the eye. But Efron and Schilling invest in their characters, and they effortlessly pull the viewer in. It helps that the little boy is likable. There's a stillness and thoughtfulness to the film which I appreciated. It doesn't indulge in too many grand gestures, although, okay, the climactic sequence is pretty melodramatic.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[1, 1]","If you're in the mood for an estrogen-soaked weeper, here is another Nicholas Sparks (""The Last Song"") novel...you know, all swoony... with bayous. They contrived a ""Notebook""-type scene in a shower stall instead of a rainstorm, but Zac Efron and Taylor Schilling will never be Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams! They might be as pretty, but these PG-13 love scenes are endless! Where is the fast-forward on my remote when I need it! Amazon will let me know when the DVD is available.If you've seen the trailers, you know we start in a war zone with Zac, a corporal in a Marine platoon that is ambushed. By the time the dust settles, he is resting beside the rubble and sees something glint in the sunlight. As he goes over to pick up a snapshot of a pretty woman, a mortar hits right where he had been; the photo literally saves his life. He doesn't know who dropped it and has a devil of a time trying to figure out who the pretty woman is so he can thank her.Here is the attractive cast:* Zac Efron (""17 Again"") as our hero Logan, tracks down the mysterious lovely young woman from that photo. Efron is still trying to reboot his career after the ""High School Musical"" franchise. His movies are squeaky clean and he is nicely buffed, but his love scenes don't generate much heat; he can only look sincere and earnest for so long....* Taylor Schilling (""Atlas Shrugged, Part I"") as Beth, a divorced mother who runs a professional dog training facility and boarding kennel with her grandmother. She is troubled by the rumor that her brother was killed by friendly fire.* Blythe Danner (""What's Your Number"") as Ellie, the wise and witty grandmother. She hires Logan over Beth's objections, then smiles as our two leads predictably fall in love.*Jay R. Ferguson (Lots of TV) is Keith, a small-town cop who shares custody of their boy with Beth, but suffers from an overdose of testosterone.Director Scott Hicks (""No Reservations"") has captured the challenges of post-war adjustment by showing our hero's reaction to video games and unexpected situations without making them the central theme of the movie. I appreciate that: it's believable without being melodramatic.As our hero decompresses, we get snippets of a bucolic rural life being lived at a slower pace. There is a sweet scene in a church where Logan, at the piano, accompanies a little boy playing a violin, in a simple rendition of ""In the Garden.""

Of course the scenery is romantic... but that's not the point.Spoiler alert:There's no reason for me to write a review for this movie. I do it simply because i wanna share a common trend in Hollywood that is truly dissapointing, story-wise. I wrote about it previously for two other movies but it could be the same for countless of other films. That is, what i call, the ""stretching effect"". You have a good idea. Not necessarily original. But good nonetheless. You set the story in motion with interesting characters and a captivating plot. Then, the hero needs to tell something to the heroine. If he does, it will destroy something. Drama will follow. We are at about thirty minutes, or so, in the movie. My point is: why not reveal the darn thing right there? Let it break something. Let drama unfold. And then, go in a new and original direction. Instead, the hero will shut up, for X or Y reason. He will not reveal what he should reveal. The story will stretch for a good hour before, finally, at the end, the hero can at last reveal what he should have revealed sixty minutes ago. But then, when it becomes interesting, well, the movie is over. Plus, with all the films built in the same fashion, you pretty much guess everything that's gonna happen anyway. No suspense there.And then, there's another sad trend in Hollywood: the overlong and unnecessary intro. Why not start immediatly with a close-up on the picture, then on the soldier who picks it up? You see the explosion then, on to the hospital where the hero realises that the picture actually ""saved"" him by moving him away from the explosion. There. Not even five minutes. Done. The real movie can begin. Instead, we go through scenes and scenes of war, explosions, dialogues, so on and so on. It's not a war movie. It's a romantic story. There is plenty of original ways to suggest whatever you want without spending too much time on it. But that's Hollywood. Always putting more.And then, there's Zac Efron. I thought he was pretty good. Surprising even. But i never really bought the fact that a woman like that would fall in love with a boy like that. Not a man. A boy. He looked like a teenager. I would have prefered an older actor with a harsher face.

1499917,A2RKLZ21ST874P,B005S9EK1S,"JennJ ""jenng13""","[0, 0]","The movie is based on Nicholas Sparks' bestseller The Lucky One. It revolves around Logan Thibault a sergent in the U.S. Marine Corps. He has been through three tours in Iraq and during his last mission he and his unit are ambushed. While many of his unit didn't make it Logan does and when he finds a photograph of a young woman in the rubble outside he is enthralled by the beauty of the woman's smiling face. He tries to find the owner of the photograph, but when no one claims it he carries it with him and begins to feel that this mystery woman is his good luck charm. Upon returning home he feels that he no longer fits in with his family or anyone else. Logan is suffering badly from PTSD. His body is back from combat but his mind and emotions are still extremely raw from all that he has witnessed. After an incident with his nephew he decides it would be better for everyone involved if he left.Logan decides to try and track down the woman in the photograph to find out more about who it belonged to and to say thank you for being his &#34;guardian angel&#34; and helping him make it through one of the hardest times in his life.When he finally does find Beth he is drawn to her even more than he was her photo (which was a lot). But he can't find the words to tell her why he is really there and after she mistakens him for an applicant for the job at her families kennel he decides to take the job to get to know her better.Beth is extremely wary of Logan at first and tries to keep her distance but her grandmother Ellie likes him from the start and sees in him a good hard working young man who just might be what her granddaughter has been needing all along.Beth and Logan do finally start to hit it off (especially after how Beth sees how good Logan is with her young son Ben). The feelings between the two grow steadily and when they finally realize that each of them is falling in love is right when things start to hit the fan with Beth's ex-husband who is also a sherriff's deputy decides that he wants Beth back and he doesn't want Logan around his son and he makes his feelings well known to both Beth and Logan on the matter.Can Beth and Logan make it past all the obstacles around them that seem to be working against them to finally be together. Or when Beth finally finds out how Logan really came to be in her life how will she react? There are several more twists and turns but I won't go into those because I don't want to give any of the rest of the plot away. But this movie is not to be missed by anyone that loves a good love story.It's a great movie with two great young actors who's chemistry together is amazing. They were so convincing onscreen in fact that there were rumors for a while that the two might have been an item in real life when the cameras stopped rolling. Once you see the movie you will understand why. They really do sizzle together.I highly recommend the Lucky One.

He's shell shocked and edgy, and believes that the picture of a pretty, smiling blonde woman that he found on the ground during a raid gave him luck and protected him from harm. He sets out to find the woman in the picture and ends up working for the woman, played by Taylor Schilling, in her dog kennel business; but he doesn't reveal to her that his presence there is anything more than chance.If you've ever read or watched any Nicholas Sparks novels, you know the two will end up together, but the journey of discovery is always interesting and filled with a few challenges and sub-plots. In this case, the angry aggressive ex-husband, a policeman in the local force, bullies his wife, constantly threatening to take her back to court to win sole custody of their son. The actor who played the young son is delightful, and the grandmother, played by Blythe Danner, is the Rock of Gibraltar, always ready with some pithy comment or observation. I want to be just like her when I'm older - oh wait I AM older :)The chemistry between Zac and Taylor is palpable and beautiful, as are the wonderful settings in the old home and grounds surrounding the family business. I don't know whether the same cinematographer works on all Sparks' movies, but there always seems to be an ethereal light and glow that signifies happiness, and this film is no exception. Some of the scenes in early morning and late afternoon light are just breathtaking.Without providing any plot spoilers, I'll just say that the plot is interesting and believable and the characters are well-cast. The plot rises to a dramatic arc, leaving you wondering whether a happy ending will occur...

Just then a mortar lands where he had been sitting, killing those in the immediate area.Stunned but glad to be alive Logan carries the photo around asking others in his platoon if they recognize the girl or know who the picture belongs to. No one does.Just prior to returning home, Logan and a fellow soldier are driving and joking about the picture. The humvee is taken out by a roadside bomb. One dies. Logan lives. He convinces himself that he's carrying a photo of his guardian angel.Logan tries to resettle in his native Colorado, but the only one he can get along with is Zeus, his German Shepherd.He has spent time researching a lighthouse which appears in the photo and determines it was taken in Louisiana. So he sets out with his dog to locate his guardian angel.He finds her where she works at a dog kennel. The lady Beth Clayton (Taylor Schilling) finds it weird that a grown man would walk with his dog from Colorado to Louisiana. So she is wary. Her grandmother, Ellie (Blythe Danner) sees something else and offers Logan a job.

That isn't the problem with this movie as it is bathed in cliches and unbelievable scenarios.  The biggest issue is that nothing much really happens.  The actors are beautiful to look at, the cinematography and location is stunning.  It's a sweet romantic drama story, but there isn't enough feeling or dramatics.Zac Efron plays Logan, a guy who is at war in the opening sequence where he stumbles upon a photo of a girl.  He chalks it up to fate that finding that photo saved his life.  He walks across several states if you can believe that to locate this girl to thank her.  Oh wouldn't you know it, when he gets there he can't bring himself to thank her and instead accepts a job position working for her on her farm.  Beth, played by Taylor Schilling, coincidentally lost her brother in the war.  She has a young son and a jealous ex-husband who is a drunk cop.  This guy doesn't like Zac Efron's character hanging around so he makes all kinds of bullied threats.  That's about as intense as the movie gets.The saving grace is the girls grandmother, Blythe Danner, who lights up the screen with all sorts of prophetic wisdom.  She seems to be the only one who knows Logan and Beth are destined for one another.  If only she was on the screen whenever the drunk cop ex was around making all kinds of noise.  Zac Efron is a gifted actor and shines in movies where he can showcase his musical skills and emotion.  However, in this he plays a guy that has to reserve his emotion and it doesn't seem to quite work.  It feels stiff and not terribly exciting or moving.This was enjoyable to watch once, but I don't think it's one I'll ever have the urge to pop in again, but maybe you will.",3,"Sweet love story, but lacks conflict.",1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,1815,"['Most', 'people', 'know', 'when', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'adapted', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'book', 'going', 'be', 'bit', 'sappy', ""n't"", 'problem', 'movie', 'bathed', 'cliches', 'unbelievable', 'scenarios', 'biggest', 'issue', 'nothing', 'much', 'really', 'actors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'look', 'cinematography', 'location', 'stunning', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'drama', 'story', ""n't"", 'enough', 'feeling', 'dramatics.Zac', 'Efron', 'Logan', 'guy', 'who', 'war', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'photo', 'girl', 'up', 'fate', 'finding', 'photo', 'saved', 'life', 'several', 'states', 'can', 'believe', 'locate', 'girl', 'thank', 'Oh', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'thank', 'instead', 'accepts', 'job', 'position', 'working', 'farm', 'Beth', 'played', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'coincidentally', 'lost', 'brother', 'war', 'young', 'son', 'jealous', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'drunk', 'cop', 'guy', ""n't"", 'like', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'character', 'hanging', 'around', 'so', 'kinds', 'bullied', 'threats', 'about', 'as', 'intense', 'movie', 'gets.The', 'saving', 'grace', 'girls', 'grandmother', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'who', 'up', 'screen', 'sorts', 'prophetic', 'wisdom', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Logan', 'Beth', 'are', 'destined', 'one', 'only', 'was', 'screen', 'whenever', 'drunk', 'cop', 'ex', 'was', 'making', 'kinds', 'noise', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'gifted', 'actor', 'shines', 'movies', 'where', 'can', 'showcase', 'musical', 'skills', 'emotion', 'However', 'guy', 'reserve', 'emotion', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'work', 'stiff', 'not', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'moving.This', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'have', 'urge', 'pop', 'again', 'maybe', 'will']",The Lucky One

He has taken a simple story with complicated characters and made them emotionally accessible to your heart in a believable environment.This is the story of one man's emotional journey starting after his third tour in the Middle East who ends up going back home to Colorado only to end up walking, yes walking, all the way to the south in Louisiana all because of a photograph he found in wartime. What's important about this photo? This photo actually saves his life. You'll have to see the movie to see how.Zac Efron (17 Again, High School Musical 3) pulls his most amazing performance yet. He has grown of the teen cult phenomenon he was to an actual actor with depth and range. His performance is subtle, quiet and extremely real. His honesty and passion shine through his low keyed physical actions. I was really impressed with his performance.Logan (Efron) pursues the image in a picture that literally saves his life only to find this woman in the picture, played brilliantly by Taylor Schilling (Mercy), has a son with a similar loss/past. Her mother, play by Blyth Danner (Futureworld, Meet The Parents), was an amazing support for both these young people to understand what they both need most. The young son played by Riley Thomas Stewart (How I et Your Mother, House M.D.) was amazing and added to this small cast ensemble as a real believable motivator for both his mother and this new `kennel hand' name Logan.The next standout performance was played by Jay R. Ferguson (Mad Men, No Ordinary Family) Beth's (Shilling) ex-husband. He was evil personified. He gave reasons for why the passion in everyone in this film was focused on the family unit and why taking care of yourself does includes your family.The somewhat slower than normal screenplay was written by Will Fetters (Georgetown) based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks who gave those other heart-tugging novels like `The Notebook', `Dear John', `Nights at Rodanthe' and `Message In a Bottle'. This author knows how to pull your heart-strings - hard.

He survives the tour and sets out to find her. Upon locating the lady, a romance ensues, in spite of her jealous ex-husband and the marine's failure to reveal why he has shown up. This is another Nicholas Sparks romance adapted for the big screen, and it is perhaps the best one yet. The film contains all the classic hallmarks of a romance: a handsome hero, a beautiful lady, a villain, and steamy romantic sequences.

1500045,A3006RT4G6YVU8,B005S9EK1S,Sadie,"[9, 12]","I love this movie! It's about fate, destiny and true love through many obstacles. The movie starts out with a 25 year old marine Logan Thibault, played perfectly by a now grown up, filled out and very handsome Zac Efron. The war scenes are all of 5 minutes long during the very beginning of the film. Logan has just survived a night raid in Iraq when he comes across a picture of a young woman in the rubble and decides that she is his ""guardian angel"" because he survives things he shouldn't have. He vows to find her if he gets out alive. His best friend Victor sadly dies in another raid 8 months later. After Logan's third term at war ends, he decides to find her and thank her for saving his life. We learn that Logan, who briefly stays with his sister and her kids, is suffering from post tramatic stress syndrome and he is lonely and depressed. He finds out the picture of the woman is from Hamden, Louisianna because there is also a lighthouse in the picture with the woman. He sets out to WALK with his dog from Colorado to Louisianna to find her. We don't learn why he doesn't hitchhike, drive or take a bus and would prefer to walk across many states. We don't know how long it takes him (I am assuming it took many, many months) but in a scene we see him ""camping out"" with his dog. He arrives in Louisianna looking very good for someone that has walked thousands of miles and was ""roughing it"" in the wilderness for months.Logan asks around at a local bar and shows the picture and finds out her name is Beth Green and she runs a nearby dog kennel. We then meet Beth and find out she lives with her Grandmother, has a 8 year old son, Ben, and runs a dog kennel business. She also has a nasty, bully of a ex husband who is the town sheriff named Keith who wants Beth back. We also learn that Beth's brother was also a marine and was killed about a year ago in action and the family has still not gotten over their grief.Her Grandmother gives Logan a job at the kennel and he moves into a run down house close by the kennel. He befriends the family quickly and helps them out with just about everything and eats meals with them and becomes fast friends with Beth's son.The cinemetography is beautiful in this film with the play of light of the sunrises and sunsets of Louisianna, it was filmed during the fall season and the colors are gorgeous, but it's really Zac Efron that steals every scene with his beautiful, expressive, bright blue eyes with lush eyelashes. This man is beyond beautiful! He is breath takingly handsome, his eyes, his lips, his dark hair, and his body. You can't take your eyes off him. He is troubled, torn and so intense, Zac plays this perfectly. His expression does not change much during the entire film. I wish we could of seen him smile more, but that was the part he was playing.Everything about Logan is the perfect man, he is a hardworker and can fix anything, he is kind, caring and sensitive, romantic, plays the piano, great with the dogs at the kennel, and extremely good looking. He is also excellent with Beth's son and they play chess together and a special bond forms between them. Logan restores her family's old boat and gets it running after many years of just sitting. He is a big help and great to have around. Logan has a heart of gold. Beth believes Logan is too good to be true, and resists him at first and then he wins her over. We watch Beth checking him out from a distance, noticing how handsome and muscular he is.I felt that the actress they chose to play Beth (Taylor Schilling) wasn't quite right for the part. She seemed a little too old to play opposite Zac Effron and their chemistry is somewhat lacking, that being said, we watch the couple first become friends, go out on a date, then trust each other and then fall in love then become lovers.The love scenes I think could of been done a little better, the couple starts kissing in a outdoor shower and the audience sees this through some shutters (which makes it kind of distracting). They are just kissing and early stage undressing at this point. They then proceed to a mosiquito netted canapy bed where the couple makes love for the first time. There is no nudity at all. Again, it's Zac's beautiful eyes and the way he looks at her when they are intimate that makes it seem so real. It's HIS beauty that is showcased. It's very tender and beautiful and you believe the couple is deeply in love like he can't believe this is really happening. Although, they never say ""I Love You"" to each other at any time during the film. I guess the words aren't really necessary. They don't show Zac from the front as much during these love scenes you only see his bare back and how muscular he has become.The ex husband Keith finds out about their romance and becomes increasingly jealous and crazy and threatens to take Ben from Beth if she doesn't break up with Logan. Keith finds the picture of Beth that Logan had in his possesion, after he broke into his house and stole the picture. Keith shows Beth the picture. Beth confronts Logan and tries to break up with him and we see Logan packing during a wild, violent rain storm but he doesn't leave yet.Keith turns up at Beth's during the storm and wants to take Ben for good, Ben flees to his tree house with rope stairs across a rapidly rising river from the flash flood. Keith tries to save Ben with Beth and Logan close behind him, and when Keith reaches Ben on the rising river he hands him to Logan and then the tree house falls and kills Keith. I felt the ending was too convienent and quick, the bad guy gets killed and then the others live happily ever after, now that's he's gone and out of the way.After Keith's death, Logan is walking away preparing to leave for good, and Beth runs after him and says ""please stay, you belong with us"" (which I believe is his reward for all he's been through during the war) and then they hug & kiss. It's a very emotional scene.The last scene is Beth, Ben & Logan out in the boat Logan restored playing happy family. Definately living happily ever after.I would really recommend this movie, the acting is wonderful, it's a heart warming, beautiful love story. It makes you say: ""I wish this would happen to me"". I wish someone like Logan would walk into my life.",5,"Zac Efron Steals every scene!

Love songs. Touching scenes. The girl that missing her pass away brother and divorced with a child. A 3 way love triangle between our 2 love birds and the dad of the kid. This gives the audience somewhat a villain in the movie.  Now the plot all setup and ready to go.I thought Zac Efron did a great job when he played the silent strong type for his character towards the girl. But, I didn't believe him when he was in Iraq and playing a Marine. He didn't make me believe in his and I didn't really care for it. The girl, Taylor Schilling, wasn't that great of an actress. She just did a okay job. The son, Riley Thomas Stewart, did a great job with his acting and scenes. Jay R. Ferguson, did an okay job playing a controlling father/Ex-husband.I thought this movie was all right. There were good scenes with Efron's character and Stewart's character bonding together. There was great scenes with Efron's character and the grandmother bonding together. This all leaded to Efron's character becoming more of a family member and letting Schilling's character want to love him even more.

But I AM a Zac Efron fan, and my sister raved about this one enough ... I just finished watching it.The film itself is totally predictable, down to the ""put a child in jeopardy to elicit sympathy"" end conflict and the uber-obvious ending.  Zac Efron, who has grown SO much as an actor, regressed a bit here, his Logan bland and one-dimensional - virtually a clone, in tone and personality, to his Charlie St. Cloud character in the film of the same name.I don't write many reviews, and this so-so film is only the exception because of the Amazon reviewer who posted for this film, Kathleen C. Fennessy - who really should actually pay attention to the films she supposedly watches more.  She talks about how Efron's Logan character ""sets out for North Carolina (it's never clear how he figures that out as a destination)"", when in actuality the character sets out for Louisiana, and DOES SO because he tracks down the lighthouse in the background of Beth's photo, heading directly to where it's located.THAT was plain annoying; even I was barely emotionally invested in the film by that point, but paid enough attention to know this plot point.  If you're going to do the snack or bathroom break, Ms. Fennessy, please PAUSE the film; don't let it run so that you miss stuff!That said, 'The Lucky One' is very typical of its genre, and should please many who love that genre.

She has trouble dealing with the death of her brother in Iraq, who she feels died for no reason. The local sheriff (Jay R.

Logan is how women want them to be.My ""chick flick"" detector went off when I saw the movie poster. You wait for him to tell her about the photo...which would have been better if she said, ""That's not me, you have the wrong girl."" At which point he packs up and leaves, but they opted not to do it my way. This is a romance novel brought to the screen. The man is handsome, fit, intelligent, understanding, a good father, musically inclined, dances, fixes things up around the house, no vices, and a knight who protects his lady...not to mention the final soul mate connection. It hurt my brain to watch it, but the women seemed to love this fantasy.The film was well made and acted. Good music score. But it wasn't my cup of tea. I will go 4 stars based on other people's reaction and not my own. If you love romance novels, this is your book come to life.No f-bombs, no nudity, some love scenes.

1500090,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005S9EK1S,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[3, 4]","At this point, it's become way too easy to track the formulaic path of any Nicholas Sparks adaptation. Vaguely sketched characters lust for love in the midst of barely defined, supposedly trying circumstances, with very little real drama to be found. Those looking for sexual sizzle tend to walk away hot, bothered, and unfulfilled. Doesn't matter which no-name director takes the helm, the creative results are the same and roughly the same amount of people show up.Ironic that Sparks' cookie cutter, conveyor belt brand of romance so frequently revolves around the idea of destiny and fate. The Lucky One stars Zac Efron as Marine Sgt. Logan Thibault, the luckiest soldier serving in Iraq after finding the photo of a mysterious blond beauty buried in the sand. The image serves as his good luck charm, surviving many an altercation that left his squad mates dead. They apparently weren't smart enough to carry photos of hot chicks in their back pockets. They're a real life saver.Discharged, Logan sets out to find the woman he thinks saved his life. After a disastrous stop at home where his PTSD is flared by a pair of rambunctious nephews, he pulls a Forrest Gump and hoofs it(along with his ""Awww"" inspiring doggie pal) from Colorado to idyllic, unnaturally sparkling North Carolina, where he meets Beth(Taylor Schilling), the woman from the photo and owner of rundown dog kennel. After the prerequisite misunderstanding and Logan's unexplained inability to reveal the truth, he winds up scooping puppy poop for Beth and her wise old grandmother(the excellent Blythe Danner).Sparks typically ladles on the melodrama like thick gravy. Beth has a precocious 7-year old son who bonds with Logan over chess and playing the violin. She also has a lunk-headed jerk of an ex-husband(Jay R. Ferguson), the town sheriff's deputy who uses his law enforcement and legal connections to make her virtually untouchable to the opposite sex. Did we mention that her grandma is sick, and that her parents died while she was young? The only thing that could make it worse is if she were to fall in love with a studly stranger and invoke the violent ire of her ex-hubby. Oh..wait, that's exactly what happens.If there is a Michael Bay of romance films, Nicholas Sparks has proven time and time again that he is it. He nails some of the bigger emotional moments, especially as Logan and Beth's courtship leads to a surprisingly steamy(for a Sparks film, anyway) shower scene. However, Sparks fails in all of the small details that make a story feel complete. Beth's ex is cartoonishly evil, reminiscent of the bullies you'd see in 80s teen comedies. As usual there are very few real stakes involved, and the resolution is never in doubt even for a moment. One thing in Sparks' favor is that he tweaks the inevitable death of a major character, veering away from his norm and raining hell on the unfortunate victim in a way that was the most unexpected aspect of the story.The only thing that saves the film from total disaster are strong performances by Efron, Schilling, and Danner. For Efron, he's in over his head when trying to act like a hardened soldier, his laughable post-traumatic rages getting the film off to a rocky start it struggles to overcome. He improves later on, showing a real growth as an actor and overcoming a weak kneed script. Sparks novels, and movies for that matter, target the female audience but more often than not feature poorly realized women characters and worse performances. Schilling is a welcome breath of fresh air, equal parts beauty and strength, giving Beth a dignity we don't get to see often enough.The Notebook is always cited as the best of his adaptations, and that is true to some extent because of its mesmerizing stars. However, a look back at it reveals that Sparks was merely setting the stage for a career of weak plots and poorly defined, sappy characters. The Lucky One continues that trend, appealing only to the Sparks converted looking for an easy, comfortable, love story.",3,"Great for Nicholas Sparks fans, everyone else should run for the hills",1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,4018,"['point', 'become', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'track', 'formulaic', 'path', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'adaptation', 'Vaguely', 'sketched', 'characters', 'lust', 'love', 'midst', 'barely', 'defined', 'supposedly', 'trying', 'circumstances', 'very', 'little', 'real', 'drama', 'be', 'found', 'looking', 'sexual', 'sizzle', 'tend', 'walk', 'away', 'hot', 'bothered', 'unfulfilled', ""n't"", 'matter', 'no-name', 'director', 'helm', 'creative', 'results', 'are', 'same', 'roughly', 'same', 'amount', 'people', 'show', 'up.Ironic', 'Sparks', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'conveyor', 'belt', 'brand', 'romance', 'so', 'frequently', 'idea', 'destiny', 'fate', 'Lucky', 'One', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Marine', 'Sgt', 'Logan', 'Thibault', 'luckiest', 'soldier', 'serving', 'Iraq', 'finding', 'photo', 'mysterious', 'blond', 'beauty', 'buried', 'sand', 'image', 'good', 'luck', 'charm', 'surviving', 'many', 'altercation', 'left', 'squad', 'mates', 'dead', 'apparently', 'were', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'carry', 'photos', 'hot', 'chicks', 'back', 'pockets', ""'re"", 'real', 'life', 'saver.Discharged', 'Logan', 'out', 'find', 'woman', 'saved', 'life', 'disastrous', 'stop', 'home', 'where', 'PTSD', 'flared', 'pair', 'rambunctious', 'nephews', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'hoofs', 'Awww', 'inspiring', 'doggie', 'pal', 'Colorado', 'idyllic', 'unnaturally', 'sparkling', 'North', 'Carolina', 'where', 'Beth', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'woman', 'photo', 'owner', 'rundown', 'dog', 'kennel', 'prerequisite', 'misunderstanding', 'Logan', 'unexplained', 'inability', 'reveal', 'truth', 'up', 'scooping', 'puppy', 'poop', 'Beth', 'wise', 'old', 'grandmother', 'excellent', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'typically', 'ladles', 'melodrama', 'thick', 'gravy', 'Beth', 'precocious', '7-year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'bonds', 'Logan', 'chess', 'playing', 'violin', 'also', 'lunk-headed', 'jerk', 'ex-husband', 'Jay', 'R.', 'Ferguson', 'town', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'who', 'law', 'enforcement', 'legal', 'connections', 'make', 'virtually', 'untouchable', 'opposite', 'sex', 'Did', 'mention', 'grandma', 'sick', 'parents', 'died', 'was', 'young', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'make', 'worse', 'were', 'fall', 'love', 'studly', 'stranger', 'invoke', 'violent', 'ire', 'ex-hubby', 'Oh..wait', 'exactly', 'what', 'happens.If', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'romance', 'films', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'proven', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'bigger', 'emotional', 'moments', 'especially', 'Logan', 'Beth', 'courtship', 'surprisingly', 'steamy', 'Sparks', 'film', 'anyway', 'shower', 'scene', 'However', 'Sparks', 'small', 'details', 'make', 'story', 'feel', 'complete', 'Beth', 'ex', 'cartoonishly', 'evil', 'reminiscent', 'bullies', ""'d"", 'see', '80s', 'teen', 'comedies', 'usual', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'real', 'stakes', 'involved', 'resolution', 'never', 'doubt', 'even', 'moment', 'One', 'thing', 'Sparks', 'favor', 'inevitable', 'death', 'major', 'character', 'veering', 'away', 'norm', 'raining', 'hell', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'way', 'was', 'most', 'unexpected', 'aspect', 'story.The', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'total', 'disaster', 'are', 'strong', 'performances', 'Efron', 'Schilling', 'Danner', 'Efron', 'head', 'when', 'trying', 'act', 'hardened', 'soldier', 'laughable', 'post-traumatic', 'rages', 'getting', 'film', 'rocky', 'start', 'overcome', 'later', 'showing', 'real', 'growth', 'actor', 'overcoming', 'weak', 'kneed', 'script', 'Sparks', 'novels', 'movies', 'matter', 'target', 'female', 'audience', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'feature', 'poorly', 'realized', 'women', 'characters', 'worse', 'performances', 'Schilling', 'welcome', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'equal', 'parts', 'beauty', 'strength', 'giving', 'Beth', 'dignity', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'often', 'enough.The', 'Notebook', 'always', 'cited', 'best', 'adaptations', 'true', 'extent', 'mesmerizing', 'stars', 'However', 'look', 'back', 'Sparks', 'was', 'merely', 'setting', 'stage', 'career', 'weak', 'plots', 'poorly', 'defined', 'sappy', 'characters', 'Lucky', 'One', 'trend', 'appealing', 'only', 'Sparks', 'converted', 'looking', 'easy', 'comfortable', 'love', 'story']",The Lucky One

Clearly Nicholas Sparks does. Whether that makes a good story or not is an entirely different question.Sergeant Logan Thibault (played by Zac Efron) is on his third tour in Iraq when he and his fellow soldiers engage in a firefight. Logan (Efron) is spared but not everyone is so fortunate. Then, following the firefight, he sees something on the ground and, as he bends down to pick it up, there's an explosion which takes the lives of even more of his compatriots. Still, thanks to the picture, he lived. While travelling in an armored vehicle discussing this, another soldier dies and, again, Logan doesn't. He attributes this to the picture and, more specifically, the woman in it. So, after it becomes clear to Logan and his family that he brought home a good deal more than a photo, he decides it'd be better if he left and sets out, on foot, to find the woman who he considers his guardian angel. With nothing more than the photo and whatever was written on the back, he finds this woman more than one thousand miles away in New Orleans. Her name is Beth Clayton. Beth (played by Taylor Schilling) is divorced, a mother, on sabbatical from her career as an elementary school teacher and running a kennel with her mother Ellie (played by Blythe Danner) who's recently suffered a stroke. Coincidentally, Logan left a dog with his family before going to war and came to Louisiana with said dog in tow. Also coincidentally, Beth (Schilling) is looking for help and offers the job to Logan immediately once she hears he's a former Marine. She regrets that once she hears how he made his way to Louisiana but her mother (Danner) tells him he has the job and after that there was nothing to be done.Of the seventeen novels written by Nicholas Sparks, this is the seventh to be adapted for the screen, the sixth I've seen, and the only one I've seen in the theater. The worst was, without a doubt, 2010's The Last Song starring Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear. The best was The Notebook. As for its predecessors, Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember, I'd rank them somewhere in between. Many have commented that Schilling is too old to be playing opposite the former star of the High School Musical series, but as Efron is a mere three years younger than his co-star, I'd say it's the least significant problem in a drama with many, many others. Others include the Homeric trek undertaken by the main character and the inexplicable manner by which he accomplishes what he set out to. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money.

Since the 1996 film, Mr. Hicks has made such films as ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" ""Hearts in Atlantis,"" ""No Reservations,"" and ""The Boys are Back."" They are all good, if not as great as the bio-pic of the pianist.And now comes ""The Lucky One,"" a romantic movie starring Zac Efron, and based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. The story is about a U.S. Marine Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) serving in Iraq, who finds a photo of a woman, half-buried in the dirt. As it turns out, the photo saves his life.A few months later Logan comes back to Colorado, but soon starts looking for the woman of the photo. He travels to Louisiana, where he finds his ""guardian angel"" Beth Clayton (Taylor Schilling), a dog kennel owner for whom Logan starts working.The two leads Zac Efron and Taylor Schilling deliver solid acting, and so does the supporting cast including Blythe Danner as Beth's grandmother, and Jay R. Ferguson as Beth's divorced husband. Like other films based on Sparks' novels, no one is basically ""bad"" - as Efron's hero says in a certain scene - and I like the film for that.What I didn't like about the film is the uneven pace of the film: Logan's quest for the identity of the woman of the photo that ends so fast, and his walk from Colorado to Louisiana (changed from the original's North Caroline) that ends even faster. The romance of Logan and Beth is not bad, just contrived (at their first meeting, Logan is not given a chance to tell Beth why he came all the way from Colorado). The melodramatic turn of events at the climax (involving Beth's son Ben and one tree house) is too sudden and predictable.Scott Hicks did much better in ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" where he didn't have to rely on musical montage to make the film emotional..In short, ""The Lucky One"" is a well-acted, beautifully-shot romance with two likable leads, but nothing particularly original about it.",3,"(2.5 STARS) So-so Nicholas Sparks Adaptation from the Director of ""Shine""",1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,2073,"['When', 'heard', 'movie', 'Lucky', 'One', 'what', 'interested', 'most', 'was', 'director', 'name', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'director', 'Shine', 'biopic', 'David', 'Helfgott', 'played', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', '1996', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Hicks', 'made', 'such', 'films', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'No', 'Reservations', 'Boys', 'are', 'Back', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'bio-pic', 'pianist.And', 'now', 'Lucky', 'One', 'romantic', 'movie', 'starring', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'based', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'novel', 'story', 'U.S.', 'Marine', 'Logan', 'Thibault', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'serving', 'Iraq', 'who', 'photo', 'woman', 'half-buried', 'dirt', 'out', 'photo', 'life.A', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'Logan', 'back', 'Colorado', 'soon', 'starts', 'looking', 'woman', 'photo', 'Louisiana', 'where', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Beth', 'Clayton', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'dog', 'kennel', 'owner', 'whom', 'Logan', 'working.The', 'two', 'leads', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'deliver', 'solid', 'acting', 'so', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Beth', 'grandmother', 'Jay', 'R.', 'Ferguson', 'Beth', 'divorced', 'husband', 'other', 'films', 'based', 'Sparks', 'novels', 'one', 'basically', 'bad', 'Efron', 'hero', 'certain', 'scene', 'like', 'film', 'that.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'uneven', 'pace', 'film', 'Logan', 'quest', 'identity', 'woman', 'photo', 'so', 'fast', 'walk', 'Colorado', 'Louisiana', 'changed', 'original', 'North', 'Caroline', 'even', 'faster', 'romance', 'Logan', 'Beth', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'contrived', 'first', 'meeting', 'Logan', 'not', 'given', 'chance', 'tell', 'Beth', 'why', 'came', 'way', 'Colorado', 'melodramatic', 'turn', 'events', 'climax', 'involving', 'Beth', 'son', 'Ben', 'one', 'tree', 'house', 'too', 'sudden', 'predictable.Scott', 'Hicks', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'rely', 'musical', 'montage', 'make', 'film', 'emotional..In', 'short', 'Lucky', 'One', 'well-acted', 'beautifully-shot', 'romance', 'two', 'likable', 'leads', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'original']",The Lucky One
