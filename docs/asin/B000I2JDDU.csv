1018914,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000I2JDDU,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[16, 16]","Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Lake Placid Film Festival, ""Jailbait"" is the story of Randy, just a few years out of high school, who makes the mistake of testing California's ""three strikes"" felony law (on two pot possession charges and one vandalism) and finds himself with a 25 year prison sentence.  The film opens with his goodbye to his mother and arrival at the prison, where he is assigned a cell with an older ""lifer"", Jake, who befriends him at first, but later preys on Randy's fear and the intimacy they developed in order to manipulate him and get what he wants.A powerful film which, on its surface, shows how our prison system fails young men like Randy, who become default playthings for the older, stronger inmates.  It also illustrates, without discussion (beyond Jake's laughter when he learns why Randy is there), the stupidity of any law that mandates a lengthy sentence regardless of the circumstances.  In the two lead roles, Michael Pitt (Randy) and Stephen Adly Guirgis (Jake) provide riveting performances that would have been rewarded if the subject matter was a bit less controversial.  Rated R for language and discussion of sexual activity, although there is no sex or nudity in the film itself.  The only DVD extra is the trailer and chapter stops.",3,Riveting performances in powerful film about mandatory prison sentences,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,1290,"['Winner', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'Prize', '2004', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Jailbait', 'story', 'Randy', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'mistake', 'testing', 'California', 'three', 'strikes', 'felony', 'law', 'two', 'pot', 'possession', 'charges', 'one', 'vandalism', '25', 'year', 'prison', 'sentence', 'film', 'goodbye', 'mother', 'arrival', 'prison', 'where', 'assigned', 'cell', 'older', 'lifer', 'Jake', 'who', 'first', 'later', 'preys', 'Randy', 'fear', 'intimacy', 'developed', 'order', 'manipulate', 'get', 'what', 'wants.A', 'powerful', 'film', 'surface', 'how', 'prison', 'system', 'young', 'men', 'Randy', 'who', 'become', 'default', 'playthings', 'older', 'stronger', 'inmates', 'also', 'discussion', 'Jake', 'laughter', 'when', 'why', 'Randy', 'there', 'stupidity', 'law', 'lengthy', 'sentence', 'regardless', 'circumstances', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Randy', 'Stephen', 'Adly', 'Guirgis', 'Jake', 'provide', 'riveting', 'performances', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rewarded', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'bit', 'less', 'controversial', 'Rated', 'R', 'language', 'discussion', 'sexual', 'activity', 'sex', 'nudity', 'film', 'only', 'DVD', 'extra', 'trailer', 'chapter', 'stops']",Jailbait

Marus,"[0, 0]","This movie I fell for for 2 reasons...First,because I am a major Michael Pitt lover and secondly because Stephen Adly Guirgis is one hell of an actor. Guirgis gave a performance in this movie like nobody's business, it was inspeakably incredible and powerful. Has this actor done anything else because he really deserves to up there as one academy award winning actor!!! Michael Pitt is his meek adorable self as usual though he plays a convict in jail for writing obscene language on a man's car which gets him 25 years in the cell. The chemistry between their characters is really powerful because one is domineering while the other is all out submissive and gives in to the other character's demands and requests. But at the end I believe they begin to realize they need each other to get through their time in the joint. Great dialogue and great acting by Guirgis and Pitt. If you like joint flicks, I really think you're going to like this one.",5,Strong Performance By Adly Guirgis,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,949,"['movie', 'fell', '2', 'reasons', 'First', 'am', 'major', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'lover', 'secondly', 'Stephen', 'Adly', 'Guirgis', 'one', 'hell', 'actor', 'Guirgis', 'gave', 'performance', 'movie', 'nobody', 'business', 'was', 'inspeakably', 'incredible', 'powerful', 'actor', 'done', 'anything', 'else', 'really', 'up', 'there', 'one', 'academy', 'award', 'winning', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'meek', 'adorable', 'self', 'usual', 'convict', 'jail', 'writing', 'obscene', 'language', 'man', 'car', '25', 'years', 'cell', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'really', 'powerful', 'one', 'domineering', 'other', 'submissive', 'other', 'character', 'demands', 'requests', 'end', 'believe', 'begin', 'realize', 'need', 'other', 'get', 'time', 'joint', 'Great', 'dialogue', 'great', 'acting', 'Guirgis', 'Pitt', 'like', 'joint', 'flicks', 'really', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'like', 'one']",Jailbait

The entire movie basically takes place in one cell and the storyline was a bit jumpy and it didn't build up enough that you could see a relationship building between the two which made you undertand.  True, Michael Pitt is gorgeous enough to pass as a beautiful girl in the prisioners mind but it made me feel the two were stuck together and not together because they wanted each other.It would have helped the movie if you saw some sexual interaction between the two, but that was missing also and if there was, they cut away.Michael Pitt has done a number of gay-related movies, lets just hope the next is better!",3,Worth Watching Once,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,663,"['was', 'expecting', 'little', 'more', 'movie', 'entire', 'movie', 'basically', 'place', 'one', 'cell', 'storyline', 'was', 'bit', 'jumpy', 'did', ""n't"", 'build', 'up', 'enough', 'could', 'see', 'relationship', 'building', 'two', 'made', 'undertand', 'True', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'gorgeous', 'enough', 'pass', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'prisioners', 'mind', 'made', 'feel', 'two', 'were', 'stuck', 'together', 'not', 'together', 'wanted', 'other.It', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'movie', 'saw', 'sexual', 'interaction', 'two', 'was', 'missing', 'also', 'was', 'cut', 'away.Michael', 'Pitt', 'done', 'number', 'gay-related', 'movies', 'just', 'hope', 'next', 'better']",Jailbait

A two character indie play in a way. It just made me realize how lucky I am to not be trapped in a cell with a fat vile weirdo. This ought to deter kids from committing crimes, the idea of being trapped in a cell with a scum bag weirdo, who rapes and won't stop talking about his sickening weird sex memories.
