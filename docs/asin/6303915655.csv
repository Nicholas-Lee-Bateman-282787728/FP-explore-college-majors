I think the scene that best embodies how unrealistic and moronic this film truly is, would be the one in which the two main characters (who are only about 14) find themselves covered with leeches, and so they spontaneously take off all their clothes and jump in a river, and then look SURPRISED that they've done so. Like they didn't realize that this was a stupid idea WHILE they were doing it. Now we get to sit and watch as the movie awkwardly bumbles its way through the ""I'm a guy, you're a girl, we're accidentally naked"" schtick. Just shoot me with one of those Panda tranq darts and put me out of my misery. Granted, this film did its job of keeping the kids I was with interested, but unlike most Disney films and other modern flicks geared towards young children, it had nothing to keep the adults even remotely interested.

If we are going to give our young people inspiring stories about kids doing their best to save endangered animals, we owe it to them as well as ourselves to do it in a plausible way. Free Willy is an example of a good execution of the genre. Flawed as it is in some respects, at least it approaches the subject much more realistically than The Amazing Panda Adventure. Never should children be expected to suspend disbelief so far as they must with this movie. Children are PEOPLE and they deserve much more respect than they get from hack job movies of this nature being made by filmmakers who have no idea what it means to truly reach a child's mind.

It is basically a &quot;save the panda&quot; plot that takes a small boy on a supposedly harrowing but utterly predictable journey.  The movie greatly underestimates the capacity of kids to find moral interpretations, understand symbolism, and interpret ambiguity.  What you get here is about an hour and a half of pretty predictability -- a movie that asks nothing of you as a viewer, gives nothing in return, and just  plods on with pretty images and a repetitious sound track that becomes quite irritating.  At least with the overtly &quot;bad&quot; children's films you can recoup some value by discussing how bad they are -- and why -- with your kids.  This movie doesn't even give you that opportunity.  Much better films are out there, including many &quot;classic&quot; films from earlier eras -- Walt Disney's &quot;20,000 Under the Sea&quot; or &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; for instance.

Let's face it, how can you go wrong with such a cute lead character. If you do not find pandas to be almost the cutest animal there is, you will probably not be charmed by this film.  I was struck with how good the boy is that plays the lead. It is not easy to work with animals they always steal the scene, but he did an outstanding job of holding up his character.  The two Chinese actors were excellent.  This one is for the whole family.

388339,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,6303915655,The Cool Guy,"[47, 48]","This movie is better than I expected. I thought it would be really corny and dumb. But it was really good actually.The Chinese actors in this movie really are speaking Mandarin. A good friend of mine who is Chinese was watching this movie with me, and translated the Chinese dialogue for me. It was authentic and fit with the movie. For instance, when the girl Ling and her grandfather are arguing in the back of the tractor at the beginning of the movie, the girl is complaining about this spoiled brat white kid. The grandfather is telling her to be quiet. Then when the cart crashes, the grandfather starts complaining that they've got no respect for old people.That nice little authentic touch, which was never translated on-screen, added a lot to the movie in my opinion. The only part my friend couldn't understand was when they went to the Tibetan village, because the people there were speaking Tibet dialect, not Mandarin. That just makes it more authentic.The scenery for the movie is quite beautiful. They must have had to travel far from the cities of China to find such an unpopulated, beautiful place. Shots of the city were authentic also, but it is good that the movie didn't spend much time there.Usually I like to take a movie and rip it to shreds, nitpicking each and every flaw I can find and criticizing it mercilessly. With this movie, I would rather not do that. Seeing a cute little baby panda happily running and stumbling along is a sight rarely seen, and is so cute that it makes me want to ignore anything that might be wrong with this movie otherwise.When the mama panda gets trapped in the bear-trap, man that really makes you feel bad. To me it was an even worse feeling than when Bambi's mother died. Fortunately, it all turns out good in the end.If only the same could be said for pandas in real life. Now I see why it is such a shame that there are so few of them left. Only 1,000 left? I hope the population has grown since this movie was made. It's been 10 years since then.You know, cuteness rarely does it for me. Too much cute usually makes me gag. But the cuteness in this movie just won me over. Mainly because it is so authentic. A baby panda rolling off of a log and landing on its head just can't be faked, and it is extremely cute to say the least.You can't watch the baby panda in this movie and feel nothing, unless you are just cold and dead inside.In conclusion, this is a very good family movie. As another reviewer put it, it's a movie you can watch with your kids and actually not feel bored.
