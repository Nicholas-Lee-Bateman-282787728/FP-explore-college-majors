The movie tears all the flesh away from his excellent book and keeps just a few bones.If you have not read the book, but ""kinda"" liked the movie, read the book. You are in for a huge treat.

252418,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,6301423690,Brian,"[1, 1]","I was fairly incredulous watching this train wreck of a comedy-drama about a group of infantile, incompetent, thoroughly undisciplined cops: legendary director Robert Aldrich ('Kiss Me Deadly,' 'The Flight of the Phoenix,' 'The Dirty Dozen,' 'The Longest Yard,' 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?') adapts a Joe Wambaugh novel featuring a solid roster of American character actors (James Woods, Charles Durning, Don Stroud, Vic Tayback, Louis Gossett, Jr., Randy Quaid, etc.). What could go wrong? Everything, apparently. Three quarters of 'The Choirboys' (1977)-- less a cohesive film really than a two-hour string of poorly written (and badly edited) vignettes-- is played for cheap laughs, primarily toilet humor that even the average teenager would find sophomoric, indicating that Aldrich is way out of his element here. Only the last 30 minutes gets serious, complete with cartoonish moralizing to accompany what feels like a hastily tacked-on narrative involving layers of misconduct and cover-ups, and by then you've come to dislike most of these supremely irritating public servants to a degree that you don't give a whit about their fates or feelings. A shameful waste of the talent involved.

252419,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301423690,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","When ""The Choirboys"" was released in 1977 the elites were pretty much on board in dismissing the film as filthy, sexist, racist and homophobic.  Even the author of the source novel, Joseph Wambaugh, tried to distance himself from the film.  I was fourteen when I saw it so naturally my adolescent mindset was attuned to the film's more tawdry aspects.  I haven't seen the film in over thirty years and my reaction to it now is it was ahead of its time. Because unsavory behavior is displayed by the film's protagonists does not mean it's an unsavory work.  Have any of the film's opponents been in the company of blue collar working men and listened to how they talk and think?  . I recall a few years back the film ""End of Watch"" where every other word out of a police officer's mouth was a certain four letter profanity and the critics applauded the realism . The film expertly displays the day to day routine of Los Angeles' finest and how they vent after hours.  Terrific supporting cast notably Charles Durning, Tim McIntire, a young James Woods and an unshaven Burt Young.

I believe it's a lot better than most give it credit for, it gives a seamy, gritty, out of the public eye (and sometimes in it) and some might say unrealistic view of the on and off duty life of a bunch of big city cops. I've seen it several times since as I have an old VHS copy of it and have enjoyed it more each time. Have to agree with Ian Holdsworth and his question of when is this going to come out on Dvd? Surely it has enough of a cult following to warrant a proper release. And the cast is excellent, a very well known at the time group of actors who all turn in very good performances. I believe Joseph Wambaugh disassociated himself with this film, so as I have not read the book I can only assume it has a fair bit of difference to it. That is possibly the reason why some do or don't enjoy it, so if you haven't read the book give it a look, or wait until hopefully the dvd comes out.
