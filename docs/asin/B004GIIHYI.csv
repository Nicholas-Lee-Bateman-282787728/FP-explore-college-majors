Francois ""tfrancois""","[2, 2]","...I just couldn't help but log on and comment on the following observation I made when reading reviews on this hilariously funny DVD from the late Patrice O'Neal.Why do some people feel a need to opine negatively when it it VERY CLEAR they lack a sense of humor or are lone dissenters when its obvious that over 96% of all those who reviewed found this video a work of pure genius....probably one of the most overwhelmingly highest rated I've ever seen on Amazon.  There weren't even any middle-tier ratings in the 2-3 star range...but yet some people, who clearly had NO BUSINESS even commenting on this brand of comedy, feel a need to do so when it's obvious it probably wouldn't ever had appealed to them anyway.  Essentially, what would?????Look I don't want to sound too harsh or too judgmental but it's really annoying when negative people, who you can very quickly surmise are miserable beings who look for the negative in everything and have no joy or happiness in their own lives, can't open up themselves to experiencing things outside of their comfort zone and try to learn to enjoy life in all its forms and flavors.  No...they'd rather come around and spew their negativity and obvious misery to others.  There is no more true statement than ""misery loves company.""  Except clearly not in the reviews for this item.  The miserable ones are ALONE on this one...just as they ought to be.Moral of the story folks: OPEN UP YOUR MIND and try to enjoy and appreciate the selfless work that comedians like Patrice O'Neal left us with.  No matter what is/was going on in their lives, they devote a significant part of their lives trying to spread laughter and joy to us all.  And even if certain types of comedy don't appeal to you, it's okay...JUST KEEP THE NEGATIVITY TO YOURSELF.  That's all.  It's counter-productive in this art form.
