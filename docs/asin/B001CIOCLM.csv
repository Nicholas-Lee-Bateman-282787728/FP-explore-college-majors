However, some parts were too over the top, (barking man, gorrilla banana freak man) but I think that Wendy Raquel Robinson is FUNNY as ever. She is the reason that I even purchased the DVD. The price should be cheaper though. I think this is about a $7.99 to $9.99 DVD, not $13.49.",4,Crazy but Funny!,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,329,"['found', 'message', 'play', 'be', 'point', 'However', 'parts', 'were', 'too', 'top', 'barking', 'man', 'gorrilla', 'banana', 'freak', 'man', 'think', 'Wendy', 'Raquel', 'Robinson', 'FUNNY', 'ever', 'reason', 'even', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'price', 'should', 'be', 'cheaper', 'think', '7.99', '9.99', 'DVD', 'not', '13.49']",N/A

When I received the play, I watched the beginning of it and got completely thrown aback. It was not that entertaining to me. I heard more of the audience laughing far TOOOO loud to perhaps really enjoy the play. I am going to watch it again today to see if I can get to the end of it without taking it out.",3,Hugh?,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,368,"['When', 'looked', 'previews', 'looked', 'great', 'play', 'When', 'received', 'play', 'watched', 'beginning', 'got', 'completely', 'thrown', 'aback', 'was', 'not', 'entertaining', 'heard', 'more', 'audience', 'laughing', 'far', 'TOOOO', 'loud', 'perhaps', 'really', 'enjoy', 'play', 'am', 'going', 'watch', 'again', 'today', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'end', 'taking', 'out']",N/A

Now don't get me wrong it had it's moments and when a moment was good it was gooooooood. There are a few moments that are a touch confussing as well I thought it was just me at first but we were having movie night and everyone was asking what happened. It had a message true enough and I know you can't share an entire life story of the characters in 90 mins but at least I should care about them. I didn't truly care what happened to them.  I just wanted it to get to the end so I didn't feel like I wasted my money. Bottom line this is not one of those movies where I will be poppin' it in the DVD player when there is nothing on TV.,2,It has it's moments!,1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,687,"['was', 'truly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'stage', 'play', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'had', 'moments', 'when', 'moment', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'gooooooood', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'are', 'touch', 'confussing', 'well', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'first', 'were', 'having', 'movie', 'night', 'everyone', 'was', 'asking', 'what', 'happened', 'had', 'message', 'true', 'enough', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'share', 'entire', 'life', 'story', 'characters', '90', 'mins', 'least', 'should', 'care', 'did', ""n't"", 'truly', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'just', 'wanted', 'get', 'end', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wasted', 'money', 'Bottom', 'line', 'not', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'poppin', 'DVD', 'player', 'when', 'nothing', 'TV']",N/A

While I like Wendy Raquel Robinson and Dorin Wilson they could not save this play from being good. I at moments just wanted it to be over and I had a strong urge to stop the bleeding(lol)by stopping my dvd. But I suffered through the entire thing, then promptly put it back inside its case and put it in the only place it needed to go....THE GARBAGE!!!!! this play was absolutely horrible and to even give this crap a 1-star rating is too generous.

First of all you have these two people, Dorien Wilson, a married man, who never forgot his high school crush Peaches(Wendy Raquel Robinson)yet in this play, it's best you don't go back. For one, she's got a substance abuse problem with a drink constantly in her hand, she has a lunatic ex fiance stalking her, she has unresolved past pain that she masks with the alcohol and prescription drugs, and though Wilson was warned about this woman, he still went after her to his own detriment. Talk about the grass being greener? definitely not in this instance. I tend to agree with the folks here on this because although there was potential, even with pros here,there wasn't no hope for this.
