810138,A353D2RKT2FHCL,B0001LYFGI,Bob Wolter,"[0, 0]","Great documentary reviews the Alamo: in truth and in Film. There have been a number of films lionizing the Alamo's defenders. It is justified but is it truly accurate? It was a final ""battle"" that was over in just minutes- AND with few credited witnesses. Confusion abounds!Common sense says that the reload time for the flintlock of the day was just under a minuet, so did Davy really go down swinging as ofttimes depicted- or was it more likely that he had been captured and summarily executed?There have been a number of films on the topic and they are competently reviewed in this documentary.

A long, boring re-enactment of some other battle, not the Alamo or San Jacinto. Meaningless interviews with people that have nothing to do with the history of the Alamo. Who cares about collectors of memorabilia? Lots of long-winded conversations. Just boring and pointless. Save your money on this one.

810140,A1KT1GWCW8F80,B0001LYFGI,K. Gittins,"[10, 10]","The main problem with this 75-minute documentary is it does not give a sense of the historical ""big picture"".It starts off with historians and museum curators telling us what was wrong with all the movies made about the Alamo and the depiction of the characters in them, then wanders around the subject of the battle itself. However, it fails to present a decent time-line of history, and leaves you wondering what all the fuss was about.Extras include the 40-minute 1937 movie called ""Remember the Alamo"", which at least gives a little historical perspective on the subject. Also is a 5-minute piece about weapons and uniforms described by an unusually dressed (in real life) man from the main documentary. Finally there is a trailer from John Wayne's 1960 version of ""The Alamo"".There must be better presentations of the subject, though the inexpensive price makes this DVD not a total waste as a second source of information.",2,Remember the Alamo - forget this DVD,1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,928,"['main', 'problem', '75-minute', 'documentary', 'not', 'give', 'sense', 'historical', 'big', 'picture', 'off', 'historians', 'museum', 'curators', 'telling', 'was', 'wrong', 'movies', 'made', 'Alamo', 'depiction', 'characters', 'then', 'subject', 'battle', 'However', 'present', 'decent', 'time-line', 'history', 'wondering', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about.Extras', 'include', '40-minute', '1937', 'movie', 'called', 'Remember', 'Alamo', 'least', 'little', 'historical', 'perspective', 'subject', 'Also', '5-minute', 'piece', 'weapons', 'uniforms', 'described', 'unusually', 'dressed', 'real', 'life', 'man', 'main', 'documentary', 'Finally', 'trailer', 'John', 'Wayne', '1960', 'version', 'Alamo', 'must', 'be', 'better', 'presentations', 'subject', 'inexpensive', 'price', 'DVD', 'not', 'total', 'waste', 'second', 'source', 'information']",The Alamo Documentary
810141,A1X054KUYG5V,B0001LYFGI,One-Line Film Reviews,"[2, 2]","The Bottom Line:The Alamo Documentary, despite the definitive nature of the title, does not tell any sort of history of the battle, instead talking with some success (with very limited resources and almost no film clips) about the films which have been made about the battle and then regrettably switching into a self-congratulatory and indulgent hagiography of the ""San Antonio Living History"" society, which makes for exceptionally dull filmmaking; if you are interested in the Alamo itself, stay away from this bore.2/4",2,Navel-gazing documentary,1250294400,"08 15, 2009",2009,522,"['Bottom', 'Line', 'Alamo', 'Documentary', 'definitive', 'nature', 'title', 'not', 'tell', 'sort', 'history', 'battle', 'instead', 'talking', 'success', 'very', 'limited', 'resources', 'almost', 'film', 'clips', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'battle', 'then', 'regrettably', 'switching', 'self-congratulatory', 'indulgent', 'hagiography', 'San', 'Antonio', 'Living', 'History', 'society', 'exceptionally', 'dull', 'filmmaking', 'are', 'interested', 'Alamo', 'stay', 'away', 'bore.2/4']",The Alamo Documentary

It covers everything from the actual historical facts to reenactments and film adaptations.  Alamo expert Frank Thompson is on hand as unofficial host to guide viewers through all these aspects and does a fine job.  My favorite section was ""The Crockett Craze"",  about the mid-50s fad that swept the nation.  I was 6 at the time and recall it well.  I didn't know how many products resulted from the fad until now, however.  Also included is an abridged version of the 1937 film ""Heroes of the Alamo"", which host Thompson correctly dubs as ""God-awful"".

810143,A1D3KO8LSOQ3M2,B0001LYFGI,"Reader ""wyj3""","[1, 2]","The war in Texas of 1835-36 is a very large subject, far larger than the American public probably realizes.  No one documentary can be expected to provide more than a very brief introduction.  There is a long interview with historian Stephen L. Hardin, author of ""Texian Iliad,"" the best summary history of the conflict.For some historical subjects, there is an interesting history of the history.  The Alamo forms one such subject, and that history of the history is not overlooked here.  For example, there is a segment on the phenomenal Davy Crockett craze of the 1950s.  There is some discussion of the many movies, which form a large subject in itself.",5,Good documentary,1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,657,"['war', 'Texas', '1835-36', 'very', 'large', 'subject', 'far', 'larger', 'American', 'public', 'probably', 'one', 'documentary', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'provide', 'more', 'very', 'brief', 'introduction', 'long', 'interview', 'historian', 'Stephen', 'L.', 'Hardin', 'author', 'Texian', 'Iliad', 'best', 'summary', 'history', 'conflict.For', 'historical', 'subjects', 'interesting', 'history', 'history', 'Alamo', 'one', 'such', 'subject', 'history', 'history', 'not', 'overlooked', 'here', 'example', 'segment', 'phenomenal', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'craze', '1950s', 'discussion', 'many', 'movies', 'form', 'large', 'subject']",The Alamo Documentary
