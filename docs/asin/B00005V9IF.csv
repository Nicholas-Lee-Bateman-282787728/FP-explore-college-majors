While acknowledging his personal flaws, there is no question in my mind that he is the best pure politician of the last century. His recent death has led to a great deal of reminiscing about Ronald Reagan, the great communicator and a talented politician in his own right. However, Reagan never had to overcome personal flaws of the magnitude that Clinton did. That alone is enough evidence to convince me of the magnitude of Clinton's political skills.This tape shows many interviews of people inside the Clinton camp, no opponent of Clinton's says a word of interview on the tape. One thing they all agree on is that while he was a good president, he could have been great. I can't argue with that assessment. He was president during the greatest economic expansion in the history of the country and in the first six years of his presidency we went from the point of having a federal deficit considered dangerous to the economy to a significant surplus. This was an incredible feat, one that is still very much under-appreciated.However, as would be expected, the emphasis is on the scandalous events of the Clinton presidency. Infamous phrases that will forever be linked to the Clinton name, ""Whitewater"", ""Monica Lewinsky"", ""Paula Jones"" and ""wag the dog"" are rehashed in great detail. Many of them made no more sense now than they did when they were current. After millions of dollars of expenditure and mountains of paper, no charges were ever brought against the Clintons as a consequence of Whitewater. Paula Jones has faded into the dustbin of history and in the wake of 9-11 many who accused Clinton of attacking terrorists in order to change the subject from his sexual escapades are now arguing that he did too little to stop them.Now that Clinton has been out of office for over three years and we are gearing up for the Bush re-election bid, it is time to look back and do some comparison. Clinton lied about sex and George W. Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction. In that context, seeing Clinton's lies again, they just don't seem that bad. Whatever you may think of him, Bill Clinton is a fascinating man, and the characteristics that make him so are captured on this tape.",4,"Yes, he was seriously flawed, but we had a great economy",1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,2300,"['political', 'junkie', 'followed', 'events', 'Clinton', 'candidacy', 'presidency', 'fascination', 'acknowledging', 'personal', 'flaws', 'question', 'mind', 'best', 'pure', 'politician', 'last', 'century', 'recent', 'death', 'led', 'great', 'deal', 'reminiscing', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'great', 'communicator', 'talented', 'politician', 'own', 'right', 'However', 'Reagan', 'never', 'had', 'overcome', 'personal', 'flaws', 'magnitude', 'Clinton', 'did', 'alone', 'enough', 'evidence', 'convince', 'magnitude', 'Clinton', 'political', 'skills.This', 'tape', 'many', 'interviews', 'people', 'Clinton', 'camp', 'opponent', 'Clinton', 'word', 'interview', 'tape', 'One', 'thing', 'agree', 'was', 'good', 'president', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'assessment', 'was', 'president', 'greatest', 'economic', 'expansion', 'history', 'country', 'first', 'six', 'years', 'presidency', 'went', 'point', 'having', 'federal', 'deficit', 'considered', 'dangerous', 'economy', 'significant', 'surplus', 'was', 'incredible', 'feat', 'one', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'under-appreciated.However', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'emphasis', 'scandalous', 'events', 'Clinton', 'presidency', 'Infamous', 'phrases', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'linked', 'Clinton', 'name', 'Whitewater', 'Monica', 'Lewinsky', 'Paula', 'Jones', 'wag', 'dog', 'are', 'rehashed', 'great', 'detail', 'Many', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'now', 'did', 'when', 'were', 'current', 'millions', 'dollars', 'expenditure', 'mountains', 'paper', 'charges', 'were', 'ever', 'brought', 'Clintons', 'consequence', 'Whitewater', 'Paula', 'Jones', 'faded', 'dustbin', 'history', 'wake', '9-11', 'many', 'who', 'accused', 'Clinton', 'attacking', 'terrorists', 'order', 'change', 'subject', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'are', 'now', 'arguing', 'did', 'too', 'little', 'stop', 'them.Now', 'Clinton', 'been', 'office', 'three', 'years', 'are', 'gearing', 'up', 'Bush', 're-election', 'bid', 'time', 'look', 'back', 'do', 'comparison', 'Clinton', 'lied', 'sex', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'lied', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'context', 'seeing', 'Clinton', 'lies', 'again', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad', 'may', 'think', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'fascinating', 'man', 'characteristics', 'make', 'so', 'are', 'captured', 'tape']",N/A

But my thoughts quickly changed when the very beginning indicated that even those within the Clinton camp would utter words which would bear light on Clinton's weaknesses or downsides.Sure enough, there was an honest assessment of Clinton and his actions throughout the film.  Naturally there was much praise regarding his skills and talent, however there was also some critique of him - almost in a tone of &quot;he could have been one of the greatest presidents in our history only if he didn't....&quot;I enjoyed watching the many different parts of the movie, ranging from the campaign for the Presidency up towards the end of his term, and found it to be quite informative, enjoyable and at points humorous!  (especially when George Stephanopolous tells the story of Hillary's hair and Bill's response - coming to her defense, etc.)A good movie to watch if you're interested in Bill Clinton as a person, a politician or if you're interested in the political process, the presidency.",4,An honest assessment of Bill Clinton,1088726400,"07 2, 2004",2004,1087,"['watched', 'movie', 'had', 'preconcieved', 'notion', 'would', 'be', 'entirely', 'pro-Clinton', 'thoughts', 'quickly', 'changed', 'when', 'very', 'beginning', 'indicated', 'even', 'Clinton', 'camp', 'would', 'utter', 'words', 'would', 'bear', 'light', 'Clinton', 'weaknesses', 'downsides.Sure', 'enough', 'was', 'honest', 'assessment', 'Clinton', 'actions', 'film', 'Naturally', 'was', 'much', 'praise', 'regarding', 'skills', 'talent', 'however', 'was', 'also', 'critique', 'almost', 'tone', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'greatest', 'presidents', 'history', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'quot', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'many', 'different', 'parts', 'movie', 'ranging', 'campaign', 'Presidency', 'up', 'end', 'term', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'informative', 'enjoyable', 'points', 'humorous', 'especially', 'when', 'George', 'Stephanopolous', 'story', 'Hillary', 'hair', 'Bill', 'response', 'coming', 'defense', 'etc', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'person', 'politician', ""'re"", 'interested', 'political', 'process', 'presidency']",N/A

Although PBS itself has taken some hard knocks from conservatives eager to decry it as a leftist haven, the teleplay for a 'tribute' borders on the negative and repitituous.Yes, the man known as 'slick willie' had more than his share of personal flaws, yes they were frustrating for both the American people and his inner circle, but that does not alter the fact we had a budget surplus and economic recovery after years of failed elitism.Viewers also willing to look through choppy editing can readily discern Bill and Hillary really do love each other, a factor conviently overlooked by many self-appointed 'Clinton bashers' themselves also lacking perfect marriages.",3,Mixed production,1050451200,"04 16, 2003",2003,777,"['obtained', 'video', 'birthday', 'present', 'have', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'scripting', 'evident', 'PBS', 'taken', 'hard', 'knocks', 'conservatives', 'eager', 'decry', 'leftist', 'haven', 'teleplay', ""'tribute"", 'borders', 'negative', 'repitituous.Yes', 'man', 'known', ""'slick"", 'willie', 'had', 'more', 'share', 'personal', 'flaws', 'yes', 'were', 'frustrating', 'American', 'people', 'inner', 'circle', 'not', 'alter', 'fact', 'had', 'budget', 'surplus', 'economic', 'recovery', 'years', 'failed', 'elitism.Viewers', 'also', 'willing', 'look', 'choppy', 'editing', 'can', 'readily', 'discern', 'Bill', 'Hillary', 'really', 'do', 'love', 'other', 'factor', 'conviently', 'overlooked', 'many', 'self-appointed', 'bashers', 'also', 'lacking', 'perfect', 'marriages']",N/A

A more appropriate title would have been ""The Clinton Scandals"" as the focus of the entire program is about Bill Clinton and how he was the Comback Kid while perservering from scandal after scandal.  After watching this video one gets the impression all President Clinton did was fumble his way through office and constantly defend each and every (often times vicious) attacks of both the Replublicans and scandal hungry media.It is this theme of Comeback Kid that really hampers the entire production, never really investing a thorough examination of a President who really wanted to change the way government worked.  Chris Bury, who was a correspondent during the Clinton White House, writes and narrates this production...  Would it not have been more interesting to juxtapose a man so reviled in the Washinton circle, yet so accepted by the public at large?  Why was he elected for 2 terms and carried one of the highest approval ratings while in office?  Sadly, this documentary never really tries to examine or understand this aspect of the Clinton legacy....I don't think I could recommend this video to anyone.
