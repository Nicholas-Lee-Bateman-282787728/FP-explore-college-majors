352787,A1X7GDB6TMWW7Z,6303047254,D. Hammerbeck,"[1, 3]","I caught this on Cinemax - a bad sign to begin with.  Given the cast and director one would expect a lot more.  Tim Roth wanders through the film giving an uninspired performance, spending most of the time looking exhausted and expressionless, occasionally rising to peevishness.  Malkovich - whatever happened to that very gifted actor?  It might have been around this film where he just started phoning it in.  He looks like Miss Favesham (Great Expectations) in drag (that would be a woman dressed as a man), listlessly mumbling, draped in tatters.  We know Kurz is on his last legs, but there is no sight of the greatness that Kurz supposedly embodies.  And I was quite surprised to see that it was directed by Nicolas Roeg - it seems that all involved were just in it for a paycheck and a trip to Africa, or wherever it was filmed.  The directing is flat, editing odd, though there is the occaisional cinematic sunset or sunrise shot - but how difficult is that.  The supporting cast provide good, if overly buffoonish at times characters.  Edward Fox is quite good, but is only in the film for a few scenes.  Perhaps Cinemax edited it - that is my guess, but from what I saw, this is a big miss.  Malkovich's rendering of the final famous words is so drab, so unremarkeable that it is almost laughable.  Brando's much maligned performance - quite unfair in my opinion - rises far above Malkovitch's anti-climatic appearance.  He looks like a disease ridden fop, slumming it in the tropics, unable to muster the energy or the interest to do anything but mumble and roll his eyes.",2,Uninspired with lackluster performances,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,1584,"['caught', 'Cinemax', 'bad', 'sign', 'begin', 'Given', 'cast', 'director', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'lot', 'more', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'wanders', 'film', 'giving', 'uninspired', 'performance', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'looking', 'exhausted', 'expressionless', 'occasionally', 'rising', 'peevishness', 'Malkovich', 'happened', 'very', 'gifted', 'actor', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'where', 'just', 'started', 'phoning', 'Miss', 'Favesham', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'drag', 'would', 'be', 'woman', 'dressed', 'man', 'listlessly', 'mumbling', 'draped', 'tatters', 'know', 'Kurz', 'last', 'legs', 'sight', 'greatness', 'Kurz', 'supposedly', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'see', 'was', 'directed', 'Nicolas', 'Roeg', 'involved', 'were', 'just', 'paycheck', 'trip', 'Africa', 'was', 'filmed', 'directing', 'flat', 'editing', 'odd', 'occaisional', 'cinematic', 'sunset', 'sunrise', 'shot', 'how', 'difficult', 'supporting', 'cast', 'provide', 'good', 'overly', 'buffoonish', 'times', 'characters', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'quite', 'good', 'only', 'film', 'few', 'scenes', 'Perhaps', 'Cinemax', 'edited', 'guess', 'what', 'saw', 'big', 'miss', 'Malkovich', 'rendering', 'final', 'famous', 'words', 'so', 'drab', 'so', 'unremarkeable', 'almost', 'laughable', 'Brando', 'much', 'maligned', 'performance', 'quite', 'unfair', 'opinion', 'far', 'Malkovitch', 'anti-climatic', 'appearance', 'disease', 'ridden', 'fop', 'slumming', 'tropics', 'unable', 'muster', 'energy', 'interest', 'do', 'anything', 'mumble', 'roll', 'eyes']",Heart of Darkness VHS

352790,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6303047254,Linda Linguvic,"[6, 19]","Starring John Malkovich and Tim Roth, this video was made for an HBO television special.  I was interested in it because I have always wanted to read the original Joseph Conrad novella, which was used as the basis of the very successful &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.  I thought this might be a substitute for reading the book.  Well, it wasn't.  And it might turn just me off to the book forever.The story takes place in the late 19th century and Marlowe, played by Tim Roth, is an English merchant who is sent to Africa to look for Kurtz, played by John Malkovich, a merchant who has disappeared deep into the jungle and has also stopped the very profitable ivory trade.  The tone of the video is morose and sad as Marlow travels further and further into the depths of the jungle and finds evil again and again, especially when he finally meets Kurtz.I don't know why I continued to watch because I was totally bored throughout.  It also was difficult to understand some of the dialog. I guess I was waiting for the inevitable meeting between Kurtz and Marlow.  When it finally happened I just didn't care.  The acting was good but the performances were wasted.  My  recommendation:  Don't bother.",2,Even good acting can't save this dud.

352793,A3FE8FQPQPONAW,6303047254,Michelle Pettit,"[2, 3]","Unlike many other reviewers I enjoyed this movie. I originally saw it televised and I watch it again every couple years. I think some viewers judge ""Heart of Darkness"" harshly when reflected alongside ""Apocalypse Now"" I think without the comparision, ""Heart of Darkness"" stands as a fine movie.""Heart of Darkness"" is subtle, dark and beautiful. It does not offer commentary or explanation. It is a fascinating character study of Marlowe and Mfumu especially; along with DeGriffe, Gosse, Captain Fenard, and a fascinating mix of players. Great casting on many interesting side characters and the various roles they play in a complex business of human exploitation and greed. Some of them go mad from what they see.I would give the movie five stars right away for Tim Roth as Marlowe and Isaach De Bankole as Mfumu. The friendship between the two is based on inner understanding between them. Roth plays Marlowe as a contained observer, something he does extremely well. In the midst of violence he (rightly for survival in this place) looks cool on the surface. He is just the sort of actor to play this. You can sense he knows how to endure without cracking in the moment but that the experience will never leave his inner world.I don't even know how to explain Isaach De Bankole as Mfumu. I've never seen someone portrayed with such strong inner conviction. Mfumu comes from a whole different world. Marlowe says his people are still cannibals. Yet there is a strong morality within Mfumu. He tries to protect the wards under his care. Once he is dedicated to Marlowe, he is dedicated for life. Other people may judge Mfumu for beliefs and practices that the ""civilized"" world cannot understand, but his heart is true.Like the book, by the time Marlowe finds Kurtz (Marlow's whole quest was based on finding him) the story seems somehow anti-climatic. I wonder that it is inevitable -- that the man Kurtz -- spoken about so often beforehand that he became somehow mythological -- is such a disappointment.Marlowe finds Kurtz ill and close to death. I don't know what I was expecting from Malkovich in his role as Kurtz, but I was more troubled than enchanted about it. (also, perhaps the point) He  seemed off and not-present, speaking with disjointed pauses. When Tim Roth as Marlowe comes to see him it feels like there is no energy exchanging or real interaction between them.  Perhaps there is no other way it could be.",4,Hypnotic and atmospheric,1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,2424,"['many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'originally', 'saw', 'televised', 'watch', 'again', 'couple', 'years', 'think', 'viewers', 'judge', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'harshly', 'when', 'reflected', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'think', 'comparision', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'fine', 'movie', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'subtle', 'dark', 'beautiful', 'not', 'offer', 'commentary', 'explanation', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'Marlowe', 'Mfumu', 'especially', 'DeGriffe', 'Gosse', 'Captain', 'Fenard', 'fascinating', 'mix', 'players', 'Great', 'casting', 'many', 'interesting', 'side', 'characters', 'various', 'roles', 'play', 'complex', 'business', 'human', 'exploitation', 'greed', 'go', 'mad', 'what', 'see.I', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'right', 'away', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Marlowe', 'Isaach', 'De', 'Bankole', 'Mfumu', 'friendship', 'two', 'based', 'inner', 'understanding', 'Roth', 'Marlowe', 'contained', 'observer', 'something', 'extremely', 'well', 'midst', 'violence', 'rightly', 'survival', 'place', 'cool', 'surface', 'just', 'sort', 'actor', 'play', 'can', 'sense', 'how', 'endure', 'cracking', 'moment', 'experience', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'inner', 'world.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'explain', 'Isaach', 'De', 'Bankole', 'Mfumu', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'someone', 'portrayed', 'such', 'strong', 'inner', 'conviction', 'Mfumu', 'whole', 'different', 'world', 'Marlowe', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'cannibals', 'strong', 'morality', 'Mfumu', 'protect', 'wards', 'care', 'Once', 'dedicated', 'Marlowe', 'dedicated', 'life', 'Other', 'people', 'may', 'judge', 'Mfumu', 'beliefs', 'practices', 'civilized', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'heart', 'book', 'time', 'Marlowe', 'Kurtz', 'Marlow', 'whole', 'quest', 'was', 'based', 'finding', 'story', 'somehow', 'anti-climatic', 'wonder', 'inevitable', 'man', 'Kurtz', 'spoken', 'so', 'often', 'beforehand', 'became', 'somehow', 'mythological', 'such', 'disappointment.Marlowe', 'finds', 'Kurtz', 'ill', 'close', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'Malkovich', 'role', 'Kurtz', 'was', 'more', 'troubled', 'enchanted', 'also', 'perhaps', 'point', 'seemed', 'off', 'not-present', 'speaking', 'disjointed', 'pauses', 'When', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Marlowe', 'see', 'energy', 'exchanging', 'real', 'interaction', 'Perhaps', 'other', 'way', 'could', 'be']",Heart of Darkness VHS
