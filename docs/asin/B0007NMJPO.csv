If you have a heart and don't mind having it touched, see this movie.  If you love kids, see this movie.  If you are a teacher or a musician, see this movie.  If you love old French movies, when they were good, like Truffaut and Malle....see this movie.Some of the reviewers here have complained that the story is predictable.I found the acting so good and the story so engaging that I followed right along, not knowing what was going to happen.  Even if I did (this is the second time I've seen it) it's still so charming that every moment was enjoyable. (I rarely see a movie more than once.)The Amazon reviewer actually called this overly sweet but I notice that the average number of stars assigned is five---as good as it gets, so I think he's outvoted.  Too bad some people are so cynical that they complain about  honest goodness.  There's a difference between genuine sweetness and sacharine sentimentality.  I often cringe at Hollywood's ideas of ""adorable children"" but these kids are fresh and natural.  There is no lack of pain and grit in the story either.The acting is wonderful.  Gerard Jugnot, as the pear shaped, ""chrome dome""failed musician, teacher captured my heart immediately and never let it go.I won't give it away, but the ending is terrific---Bring Kleenex!Last, the music is enchanting!  If you don't see this for any other reason, this is enough.  I love what one of the readers here said---that several angels in Heaven resigned when they heard these kids!It's a great gift idea, too!",5,TEN STARS!,1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,1614,"['Wow', '-so', 'many', 'adjectives', 'spring', 'mind', 'delightful', 'enchanting', 'inspiring', 'heartfelt', 'memorable', 'have', 'heart', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', 'touched', 'see', 'movie', 'love', 'kids', 'see', 'movie', 'are', 'teacher', 'musician', 'see', 'movie', 'love', 'old', 'French', 'movies', 'when', 'were', 'good', 'Truffaut', 'Malle', '.see', 'movie.Some', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'complained', 'story', 'predictable.I', 'acting', 'so', 'good', 'story', 'so', 'engaging', 'followed', 'right', 'along', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Even', 'did', 'second', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'still', 'so', 'charming', 'moment', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'rarely', 'see', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'actually', 'called', 'overly', 'sweet', 'notice', 'average', 'number', 'stars', 'assigned', 'five', '-as', 'good', 'think', 'outvoted', 'Too', 'bad', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'cynical', 'complain', 'honest', 'goodness', 'difference', 'genuine', 'sweetness', 'sacharine', 'sentimentality', 'often', 'cringe', 'Hollywood', 'ideas', 'adorable', 'children', 'kids', 'are', 'fresh', 'natural', 'lack', 'pain', 'grit', 'story', 'either.The', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'Gerard', 'Jugnot', 'pear', 'shaped', 'chrome', 'dome', 'failed', 'musician', 'teacher', 'captured', 'heart', 'immediately', 'never', 'let', 'go.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'terrific', '-Bring', 'Kleenex', 'Last', 'music', 'enchanting', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'reason', 'enough', 'love', 'what', 'one', 'readers', 'here', 'said', '-that', 'several', 'angels', 'Heaven', 'resigned', 'when', 'heard', 'kids', 'great', 'gift', 'idea', 'too']",N/A

884042,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B0007NMJPO,Artist & Author,"[3, 3]","I can identify with this movie because over the years our family has had about 150 different kids, mostly disadvantaged kids, stay with us for varying amounts of time.  While a lot of them didn't meet our hopes for them, I can think of only one that was simply incorrigible, unreachable.  So, when Clement can look into a hurting boy, considered incorrigible, and see a good kid, I know what he is thinking, and why.  The only trouble with this movie is that it is hard to read the subtitles through tears!It is a very touching story of one man who goes against the system of the delinquent school to bring out the best in the boys.  Clement followed the exact same steps that my wife and I  followed with difficult kids.  First, one has to gain the respect of the child by letting them know that you accept them just as they are.  When Clement covered up for mischief a kid did, while not condoning it, this is what he was doing.  Once the child knows that you are going to love him or her just as they are, then they naturally want to please the one person they can trust to love them.  So, Clement was able to start to introduce positive behaviors to the boys.  Once they started to respond to his efforts to evoke good behavior, he was able to introduce challenges each boy could accomplish if they worked at it.  As they succeeded, they built genuine positive self-esteem.  Finally, when they were familiar with the feeling of self accomplishment, Clement was able to let them fail because he knew their taste of accomplishment would come through to help them overcome the failure!  (That is what Clement was doing when Pierre got to expecting special treatment; then Clement gave Pierre a new chance to succeed at the most opportune time for Pierre.)  They then knew the path to success and true self-esteem.This is a movie about kids that really is for any adult who works with kids or that has a family.  It is a road map of how to handle strong-willed kids to raise them to become successful adults.

884055,A30AO422P01XK0,B0007NMJPO,Daniel Mackler,"[0, 4]","This movie brought tears to my eyes several times--and for that, kudos!  Overall it's a wonderful story of a music teacher who comes into a horrible, horrible reform school that abuses and tortures children, and brings light and hope and joy (via music) to some of their lives.  It is a story of redemption, and well worth watching.But even more so, it played almost entirely as true.  Aside from at the end, when the teacher confronted the headmaster (and called him ""evil"") did I feel the movie to be overdone.  So aside from one scene, I felt I was really watching the real thing, not watching actors.  Kudos again!That said, my criticisms.  Chances are most people won't agree with them say (because they usually don't), but so be it:1) The main character, the gentle music teacher, was too weak for my taste.  This especially came to light when the headmaster was viciously abusing a very disturbed boy, and in his vendetta against the boy lied and had him sent to prison for stealing money (which the boy never stole).  The music teacher could have outed the headmaster to save the boy.  But he didn't.  Instead he saved the headmaster's life and let the boy rot in jail.  Sick!2) The music teacher, while a wonderful man in some ways, was too selfish for my taste.  His main motivation in life was to further his own dreams--and he did this, at times, at the expense of the boys.  His precious chorus was more important to him than the needs of the boys.  Yes, to a degree he loved them, but he loved his music more.  For instance, when one troubled boy (the same one who was arrested) was being sent to solitary ""lock-up"" for fifteen days, the teacher's main frustration with this was not with the torture of the boy, but with the following:  ""But he's my only baritone!""  YUCK!3) I know I can be criticized for this, but I condemn anyone, seemingly benevolent or otherwise, who could even work in such a vicious torture chamber as that school.  To work there, to collect a paycheck there, to further your own artistic goals there, and to do and say nothing significant about the torture there is tantamount to acceptance of it.  And to me this is a metaphor for our world.  Hell is going on everywhere, but most people say nothing.  It's too politically incorrect.  And they don't want to risk their own skin.So, ultimately, the beloved music teacher was essentially a weak parent.

884056,A35MB3HSLQBXBG,B0007NMJPO,David Freydkin,"[1, 12]","The Chorus is a French movie with the theme that kindness and humanity conquers the affection of people rather than harshness and cruelty. The movie takes place in a boarding school for ""troubled"" boys. The main character is Clement Mathieu, a failed musician and professional trying his luck as a teacher of music in the school. The school is run by a harsh and strict headmaster named Rachin under the policy, ""action and reaction"" meaning that whenever an act of undiscipline such as playing a harmful prank on the school maintenance man Maxence or stealing a large sum of money, one or more students get punished with beatings, confinement, etc.At first Mathieu has discipline problems. However, whenever an act of indiscipline occurs, he never reveals the boy to Rachin but basicly talks to the boy and explains the wrongfulness of the action. Eventually, he wins the trust of the boys and the movie gets its highlight when he forms a choir amongst the boys of the school, a succesful choir which eventually performs in front of high-ranking French government officials.This is a very warm and touching movie about kindness and humanity. I do have some criticisms, however. Firstly, I find it unlikely a choir would be succesful amongst boys in that age group (early teens). Something more along the lines of a sports team would've been more realistic yet equally effective.Also, I don't think leniency and kindness are necessarily the right answer when instilling discipline. I was a resident assistant during my university days and have had to deal with discipline issues on many occasions. If you are too kind and lenient, people will often take advantage of you and this policy won't necessarily make them like you more, which is not the message of the movie.",4,Very powerful movie,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,1768,"['Chorus', 'French', 'movie', 'theme', 'kindness', 'humanity', 'conquers', 'affection', 'people', 'rather', 'harshness', 'cruelty', 'movie', 'place', 'boarding', 'school', 'troubled', 'boys', 'main', 'character', 'Clement', 'Mathieu', 'failed', 'musician', 'professional', 'trying', 'luck', 'teacher', 'music', 'school', 'school', 'run', 'harsh', 'strict', 'headmaster', 'named', 'Rachin', 'policy', 'action', 'reaction', 'meaning', 'whenever', 'act', 'undiscipline', 'such', 'playing', 'harmful', 'prank', 'school', 'maintenance', 'man', 'Maxence', 'stealing', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'one', 'more', 'students', 'get', 'punished', 'beatings', 'confinement', 'etc.At', 'first', 'Mathieu', 'discipline', 'problems', 'However', 'whenever', 'act', 'indiscipline', 'occurs', 'never', 'boy', 'Rachin', 'basicly', 'talks', 'boy', 'wrongfulness', 'action', 'Eventually', 'trust', 'boys', 'movie', 'highlight', 'when', 'choir', 'boys', 'school', 'succesful', 'choir', 'eventually', 'front', 'high-ranking', 'French', 'government', 'officials.This', 'very', 'warm', 'touching', 'movie', 'kindness', 'humanity', 'do', 'have', 'criticisms', 'however', 'Firstly', 'find', 'unlikely', 'choir', 'would', 'be', 'succesful', 'amongst', 'boys', 'age', 'group', 'early', 'teens', 'Something', 'more', 'lines', 'sports', 'team', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'realistic', 'yet', 'equally', 'effective.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'leniency', 'kindness', 'are', 'necessarily', 'right', 'answer', 'when', 'instilling', 'discipline', 'was', 'resident', 'assistant', 'university', 'days', 'have', 'had', 'deal', 'discipline', 'issues', 'many', 'occasions', 'are', 'too', 'kind', 'lenient', 'people', 'will', 'often', 'take', 'advantage', 'policy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'more', 'not', 'message', 'movie']",N/A

Some have gotten into scrapes with the law but most are orphaned by the war.Mathieu somehow manages to stay cheerful, although the boys disrespect him and the headmaster wants a sidekick who can share his belief in harsh discipline.  Hearing the boys singing off-key, Mathieu decides to start a chorus.  And he discovers that one boy has a rare talent.The chorus doesn't transform anyone. The boys are still boys. But they enjoy the chorus and respond, grudgingly, to their new prefect's relaxed oversightChorus seems more poignant than Mr Holland's opus.  There's no simple fairy tale ending and things do not always turn out right.  In fact, there's a bittersweet irony when Morhange seems unable to acknowledge the huge debt he owes Mathieu.The characters are multidimensional. As the film progresses, we gain insights into the headmaster's character and also an understanding of Mathieu's colleagues. The boys are shown even-handedly.In my view, what makes the film special is the realism of the post-war setting and the location in rural France, accessible by an infrequent bus service.

Dead Poets' Society, Mona Lisa Smile, Children of the Lesser God, Stand and Deliver, Mr. Holland's Opus, and all those sports flicks. The plot is typical - a group of students or a whole school of hooligans, handicapped, or privileged but uninspired adolescents transform into promising individuals who believed in themselves, thus challenging the common view that they are a hopeless bunch through the new revolutionary teacher. The teacher comes from out of town, unfamiliar with the new community, copes with their own personal failures and frustrations through an unintentional life mission, and as a result, does not sit well with the headmaster and parents, what with their with unorthodox teaching methods. Teacher struggles to reach out to students (main character usually a silent one, with untapped potential but happens to have extraordinary, scholarship-worthy talent), succeeds, but in the end cannot beat the system and eventually gets kicked out from the school.Les Choristes is a French, postwar-set version of this well-known formulaic plot. Think, Dangerous Minds meets School of Rock. Typical of most European films nominated for the Oscars, it is both subtly dramatic and comedic. It has an entire cast of adorable little faces, making it easy for the audience to fall in love with the brats. The spotlight was really on cute Pepinot, the youngest student, who does not seem to have any reason to be in that school except that he was orphaned. The heartstring-tugging themes of teaching young minds to dream, making a difference, the power of kindness, music as a universal expression - we've seen them over and over. Even the farewell scene is predictable - if in Mona Lisa Smile, the girls chased Julia Roberts' car on their bikes as she drove off and in Dead Poets' Society, everyone stood on their desks to protest Robin Williams' dismissal, here, all the students flew paper airplanes with personal notes out the window to bid goodbye to Mathieu. So, what's new?Nothing really, I'm just a sucker for charming European films like this and I won't even bother explaining how this movie is any different. Except probably that unlike most movies of the same genre that had their predictable tear-jerker parts, here I started crying about 5 minutes into the film and every 5 minutes thereafter.

Set in Fond de l'Etang, a dreary boarding school for troubled boys in 1949 France a sense of hopeless claustrophobia pervades the air.  Enter Clement Mathieu, (an absolutely remarkable performance by G&eacute;rard Jugnot that had me literally cheering) the school's new Prefect, a lonely, middle aged failed musician who narrates the story through his journal, and life will never be the same.  An unlikely Mary Poppins, his effect on the students is lifechanging as he fights for less punishments and more socially rehabilitative activities for the ruffians in his charge.  Eventually, he forms these troubled kids into ""The Chorus"" and the sound of beautiful music brightens the dank halls of Fond de l'Etang, changing the place forever.Inspired by his students, Mathieu's own rehabilitation - a restoration to the world of music, an occurrence of which he never dreamt - is as inspirational as any other aspect of this beautiful tale.  He reaches into his soul and begins composing new music.  In his journal he writes of how the boys may not understand the depth of what's occurring, but ""inspired by them, I compose, each day, for them.""There is a sense of realism to ""The Chorus"" which shows not all of these misfits can be saved, and deception, hostility and disrespect, though seemingly diminished, never completely disappear.

884062,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007NMJPO,Grady Harp,"[9, 9]","LES CHORISTES (THE CHORUS) is director Christophe Berratier's first foray into the realm of full-length films and his adaptation of the 1945 film LA CAGE AUX ROSSINGNOLS written by Georges Chaperot and Ren&eacute; Wheeler serves to introduce his talents as a master storyteller well.  This tale of how music can alter the lives of even most renegade of boys is warm, sensitive, and satisfying on every level.The story opens with the reunion of two men who were classmates at Fond de l'Etang, a boarding school for troubled boys in France in 1949.  Pepinot (Didier Flammand) arrives at the door of consummate symphony conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) with a journal written by their beloved teacher Clement Mathieu , now dead, and the two read the journal, recalling their shared childhood experiences at Fond de l'Etang.1949 and the Fond de l'Etang is a dreary jail-like, rundown place run by the cruel disciplinarian headmaster Rachin (Franois Berl&eacute;and).  Cl&eacute;ment Mathieu (G&eacute;rard Jugnot) is an older, bald, failed musician who seeks employment as a prefect in the school and immediately is forced to confront the rigors of the school's harsh discipline with the still flagrantly wild boys.  Mathieu slowly wins the confidence of his boys by standing up to the cruel Rachin and when he is near his wits' end as to how to transform his class, he hears a boy sing and decides to use his musical talent to change these boys' lives.  Two of the chief problem children are the angry but vocally gifted Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) and Leclerc (Th&eacute;odul Carr&eacute;-Cassaigne) and Mathieu coaxes them into the inner circle of his newly developing chorus.  The other child who is without talent but for whom Mathieu empathizes when the child waits every Saturday for someone to claim him at the gates is Pepinot (Maxence Perrin) who Mathieu assigns as his assistant chorus master!Through a series of incidents including the cruelty of Rachin, the appearance of Violette Morhange (Pierre's poor working mother who cannot afford to feed him), the success of the chorus in the eyes of the Countess (Carol Weiss) who acts as benefactor to the school, and  some evil doings of the more difficult children, Mathieu's Chorus becomes a symbol for how problem children can bond in mutual need to the enrichment music provides.  Rachin cannot tolerate Mathieu's success and fires him without allowing him to say a farewell to his beloved choristers.  The manner in which this is portrayed is most touching and spiritually enriching and serves to resolve the mystery of Mathieu's departure to the adult Morhange and Pepinot as they finish the journal.Simple story, told before, but superbly acted and performed.  The music is by Jean-Philippe Rameau with original songs by director Barratier and Bruno Coulais, all beautifully sung by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc with young actor Jean-Baptiste Maunier singing his own solos.  The cinematography is in the capable hands of Jean-Jacques Bouhon, Dominique Gentil, and Carlo Varini.  In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended little jewel of a film!

Far less flashy than Mr. Holland, this film centers around a reluctant music teacher and failed composer who ends up teaching at a boarding school for boys (basically a  slightly-less-than-prison for unwanted young vagabonds and troubled boys).  Without going into plot details, it deals with the growth and development of people in themselves and with each other that music can bring.  I found this to be a very profound yet simple film.  It doesn't want to shock & awe you, nor does it want to pound you with tragedy after tragedy...instead, it takes you by the hand and guides you gently through an exploration of hard reality in both music and the human heart.  It's not my most favorite music film...but it is among my top list of must see films for music teachers, music lovers, and people wanting a clean but profoundly life changing story.

So is Marie Brunel (Violette, Pierre'smum), in a pivotal secondary role. The sexual tension is greatlyresolved! Gerard Jugnot IS great as the self-effacing but brilliantschool teacher. Rachin, the principal/ headmaster, is quite overdoneand erratic, but I'm sure it's the story that sucks. He does very wellwith a stupid character. His final attack on Clement is well done, Iguess it's the only moment I felt I wasn't watching a film forchildren.The boys are VERY well cast, all of them. From the soloist soprano(what a voice!) to the criminal ""Mondain"" (name! *like Dickens :) ),the curly one, the ""pedestal"", and ""Pepinot"", the cute dreamy one wholongs for his parents. The countess is fine too.It has a lot to say about educators in harsh conditions. Things must bemuch worse now that then, but Clement would make a great childpsychologist if he really were an unemployed teacher! This ""action/reaction"" if of course a caricature of behaviourism. As such, it warnsits most fervent practitioners I guess.It's a pity, this film could have been great, the topic is importantfor it to be treated like a (bad) Disney story. It even deals aboutchild abuse in a great small dialogue in the beginning ""I expecteverything bad about people HERE"" is the simple way the prefect/ guardChabert sums it up. Who also ends up being charmed by Clement, whoseems to have a way with everybody.Kim Anehall in Amazon writes greatly about how sometimes educationreceives the ""rejects"" from other professions, makes an intelligentanalogy of Clement's ""rebellion"" to the way the French resistanceworked, and describes very well the process it entails for him to winthem over. Jeffrey E Ellis' Twain quote in the same place is GREAT, but couldwell be called ""spoilers"" too.Didn't like this whole ""racconto"" and the fact the adult Pierre is asuperstar musician. Found that particularly cheap, ""winners only"", veryAmerican in their worse sense. In he beginning Clement doesn't know howto ""stand"" in this fiery militarylike regime, his body tells it all.Some jokes demand some knowledge of French history, like his reactionsto a Vichy song when he ""auditions"" the boys, or the answer of one kid about Napoleon's death :).

Somehow, he gets hired in a reform school for boys as the prefect. Within minutes, the boys challenge him and his authority, as they are used to be treated poorly by the adminstrator Rachin.

The acting is superb, as our hero looks nothing like the traditional skinny, blond superstars that often pervade these types of films.

884076,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B0007NMJPO,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[3, 4]","Despite viewing many Japanese Anime, I cannot consider myself a foreign movie fan. I don't mind watching occasional live-action flicks from places other than America, but most of the time it's hit and miss for me. That said I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much I enjoyed LES CHORISTES (or, as the Miramax DVD release calls it, THE CHORUS).  Gently told and beautifully photographed, this drama from first-time director Christophe Barratier struck both an emotional and musical chord with this viewer--in fact it was enough to bring back childhood memories for me. But before I get all sappy, onto the movie itself.Set in 1947 France, LES CHORISTES tells the story of Cl&eacute;ment Mathieu, a music composer and teacher who finds himself taking a job at Fond de L'Etang, a run-down boarding school consisting of troubled boys who are either orphans or borderline delinquents. Mathieu, a patient, compassionate fellow, eventually turns the entire school upside down when he communicates with the boys through his special talent of music.  Before long, the insubordinate wards are transformed into a melodic chorus, much to the chagrin of the school's cruel and abusive headmaster, M. Rachin, who emphasizes corporal punishment as the method for dealing with misbehavior.  Mathieu, on the other hand, has a different --or, if you will, kinder-- method for dealing with rowdy boys.  For one thing he does not tell on them and instead sentences them to lighter consequences.Over the course of his continual (albeit forbidden) chorus sessions, Mathieu sees potential in one Pierre Morhange, a surly boy with an absolutely stupendous voice and musical gifts which enables him to become the choir's soloist. But first Mathieu must bring the troubled, quick-tempered kid out of his shell. This task is made less easier when Mathieu develops romantic feelings for Morhange's single mother, Violette; it only earns Mathieu Morhange's wrath. Eventually, however, things work out and Pierre eventually finds a career as a highly successful conductor. This is actually displayed at the beginning of the movie, where we see Morhange, as an elderly man, leading his orchestra, and later, reading through the personal journal of his former music teacher. (The whole story, in case you didn't figure out by now, is told entirely in flashback.)As entertainment, LES CHORISTES is heartfelt and uplifting without being too sappy, but as a story it is especially winning. Okay, so it may not be the most original tale --other movies have reprised many of the themes expressed in this movie countless times-- but director Barratier makes this movie ""sing"" by providing both credibility and real emotion to the characters and their situations. Aside from the numerous moments where we see the boys singing songs Mathieu writes for them, some of my favorite sequences in the movie involved Mathieu gently persuading any troubled boy into confessing their misdeed without reporting them. A subplot involving a boy stealing money from the school, in particular, turns out to be a touching episode, especially when we discover the real culprit and learn that his intentions are to free himself from the unloving walls of the school.Personally, however, this movie struck me as a delightful trip down memory lane. I used to attend a musical summer camp for several years, where I've sung in chorus. The scenes where Mathieu and his boys are performing, in particular, were strong enough to recall that special feeling of inclusion for me during the good ol' days.Speaking for the movie itself, LES CHORISTES is handsomely photographed and well-acted--particularly noteworthy are G&eacute;rard Jugnot as the kindly music teacher, Jean-Baptiste Maunier as the talented but emotionally troubled Pierre, and Maxence Perrin as a sympathetic orphan in search of his father. Naturally, since music is the subject for this movie, one would expect nothing less than the angelic sound of a boys' choir, and LES CHORISTES delivers this in full. Particularly spectacular is the song during a performance for the French countess. It helps, too, that the boys have excellent voices. (By the way, the singers are none other than the professional boys' choir Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc Choir.)Some may argue that LES CHORISTES lacks originality, especially for a film that was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, but for what it is, this is a very moving, touching story, well executed and heartfelt. I recommend it heartily, especially for music lovers and fans of feel-good movies.One catch--Miramax's DVD has an excellent visual transfer but sadly doesn't have any bonus features.  Considering that this is a recent release, one would expect more.  On the other hand, since this movie didn't receive the same ecstatic reception here in America as its native country, France, (and arthouse movies with subtitles like these aren't crowd-drawers), it probably is not too surprising.",5,"A moving French drama, well-told and with fine performances (acting and music-wise).",1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,4963,"['viewing', 'many', 'Japanese', 'Anime',

This one unfolds beautifully and it exceeds my expectations, so I recommend it to you.First of all,  the ""frame story"":  we know that we are to see the story of a teacher who comes to a school for troubled boys and teaches them to sing, but this tale is couched within the telling of events that happened much later.  A famous musician is called back to his homeland, France,  when he must bury his mother.  While there, he receives a visitor who presents him with the journal of the humble teacher who had ""discovered"" him when they were both boys at the Fond de l'&eacute;tang.  Together they read the journal and relive the events that changed both of their lives for the good.  Where the journal ends, the visitor takes up the tale and relates ""the rest of the story.""The casting is good and I also enjoyed the realistic scenery--the oppressive, dilapidated school, as so forth.  The actors seemed generally more natural and believable than Hollywood actors tend to be.  G&eacute;rard Jugnot is perfect as the unassuming and un-glamourous Clement Mattieu.  I like how the boys come in all sizes and with varied features.  Except that they are just a bit too pat;  the first ""bad boy"" is homely, the real thug is a pimply redhead, ""Boniface"" is a little curly mop-top with glasses, and the soloist with the heartrendingly beautiful voice is also beautiful of face.  And the adorable tiny-tim orphan--he gets his just reward, too.  A bit sweetsy.The film nicely illustrates the fact that there are those people living quiet lives, out of the limelight, doing ""small things"" that make big differences in our world.  Mattieu understood the meaning of life:  that every individual, no matter how hopeless he or she seems, has great worth, and that the greatest thing we can do during our brief sojourn on this planet is to help others.  To lessen suffering and to help others achieve more is the biggest achievement of all.And yes, the music is very pretty.",5,Action...Reaction,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,2078,"['Les', 'Choristes', 'delightful', 'am', 'sucker', 'boys', 'choirs', 'like', 'foreign', 'films', 'so', 'expected', 'pleasant', 'evening', 'one', 'beautifully', 'expectations', 'recommend', 'you.First', 'frame', 'story', 'know', 'are', 'see', 'story', 'teacher', 'who', 'school', 'troubled', 'boys', 'teaches', 'sing', 'tale', 'couched', 'telling', 'events', 'happened', 'much', 'later', 'famous', 'musician', 'called', 'back', 'homeland', 'France', 'when', 'must', 'bury', 'mother', 'there', 'visitor', 'who', 'journal', 'humble', 'teacher', 'who', 'had', 'discovered', 'when', 'were', 'boys', 'Fond', 'de', 'l', 'eacute', 'tang', 'Together', 'read', 'journal', 'relive', 'events', 'changed', 'lives', 'good', 'Where', 'journal', 'visitor', 'up', 'tale', 'rest', 'story', 'casting', 'good', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'realistic', 'scenery', 'oppressive', 'dilapidated', 'school', 'so', 'forth', 'actors', 'seemed', 'generally', 'more', 'natural', 'believable', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'tend', 'be', 'G', 'eacute', 'Jugnot', 'perfect', 'unassuming', 'un-glamourous', 'Clement', 'Mattieu', 'how', 'boys', 'come', 'sizes', 'varied', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'pat', 'first', 'bad', 'boy', 'homely', 'real', 'thug', 'pimply', 'redhead', 'Boniface', 'little', 'curly', 'mop-top', 'glasses', 'soloist', 'heartrendingly', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'also', 'beautiful', 'face', 'adorable', 'tiny-tim', 'orphan', 'just', 'reward', 'too', 'bit', 'sweetsy.The', 'film', 'nicely', 'fact', 'are', 'people', 'living', 'quiet', 'lives', 'limelight', 'doing', 'small', 'things', 'make', 'big', 'differences', 'world', 'Mattieu', 'understood', 'meaning', 'life', 'individual', 'matter', 'how', 'hopeless', 'great', 'worth', 'greatest', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'brief', 'sojourn', 'planet', 'help', 'others', 'lessen', 'suffering', 'help', 'others', 'achieve', 'more', 'biggest', 'achievement', 'all.And', 'yes', 'music', 'very', 'pretty']",N/A
884082,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007NMJPO,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[114, 126]","Many people with failed careers often turn to education as a refuge where they still can be a part of what they love the most.  These refugees usually do not have any idea of what they are about to do to themselves, as they are about to face young people who believe they know everything or lack the enthusiasm that they possess.  Often it turns out to be a wake-up call that the previous job was not that bad after all, despite previous failures.  Some of these refugees turn out to be excellent educators while others fail again.  In Les Choristes, known as the Chorus here in United States, the audience is introduced to one of these refugees that is about to embark on a rough voyage, as he has taken a job as supervisor in a boarding school for troubled children.Christophe Barratier who directs Les Choristes has previously produced excellent films such as Himalaya (1999) and Winged Migration (2001).  The story that Barratier tells opens in New York where a man is half in slumber on a couch when someone awakens him in order to inform him that there is an emergency phone call for him.  It appears that the man's mother has just passed away, which leads him to return to home.  When the man arrives home the audience can deduct through the mise-en-scene that the man is the best conductor in the world.  After the funeral a strange man knocks on the door to ask the conductor if he recognizes him while he has a gift for him from an old teacher.  The gift is a journal in regards to what happened in the year of 1949 at the Fond de l'Etang boarding school.The journal was a gift from his old teacher, Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), which brings the viewers back to the year of 1949.  Through this flashback the audience is introduced to the school, the students, the teachers, and the headmaster Rachin while the story begins to take form.  The school is designed to help troubled youth to get on right track before it is too late.  This means that many of the students at Fond de l'Etang are up to no good whenever they get a chance.Rachin runs the school with an iron fist with the motto: ""action - reaction"", as he has lost all hope in the children's ability and only sees the imperfections of the children.  Mathieu arrives quickly understands the psychology of Rachin, as he is forced to punish a student upon his arrival despite the student being innocent to his knowledge.  The road to gain the students' trust is a long and difficult road, and more so to get them to follow the rules that he tries to set up.  However, through compassion, self-irony, and a touch of humor Mathieu begins to get their attention.Quickly Mathieu adjusts to the school environment, as he commences a tryout for a choir.  Through the choir he gets the students to cooperate and build a meaningful sense of belonging.  The educational methods that Mathieu uses win the students over, as they begin to do actual work while showing some progress.  Unfortunately, Rachin sees the music as another way for the students to express themselves negatively and dishonorably.  Rachin does not credit Mathieu for the students' progress through the music, as he tells him to stop the choir immediately.  Despite the order from Rachin the students go underground much like the French Resistance during World War II in order to continue their music lessons.  Through these lessons Mathieu builds strong bonds with the students, as he wins their trust while teaching them the wisdom of music.The theme of Les Choristes is not unique, which can be seen in films such as Dead Poet's Society (1989), Dangerous Minds (1995), Mr. Holland's Opus (1995), and Evil (2003).  These stories are also regarding teachers in school settings that change students' lives in some profound way.  Another film that comes to mind is Cinema Paradiso (1989) that depicts an older man returning home to bury the man who changed his life.  Les Choristes is a blend between these two themes.Barratier's storytelling elusively ushers the audience into a terrific cinematic experience.  The technical aspects of filmmaking are reliable and shine in the moments when it is necessary to elevate a mood and a feeling.  The theme, which has been used before, still is powerful, as it is an essential tool for expressing gratitude to those who educate the youth of the world.  In the end, Les Choristes offers a truly joyful experience, as it displays that there is hope everywhere if one only tries to see it.",5,The Chorus - An Appreciative Gesture Towards Our Educators!,1109116800,"02 23, 2005",2005,4459,"['Many', 'people', 'failed', 'careers', 'often', 'turn', 'education', 'refuge', 'where', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'part', 'what', 'love', 'most', 'refugees', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'are', 'do', 'are', 'face', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'know', 'everything', 'lack', 'enthusiasm', 'possess', 'Often', 'out', 'be', 'wake-up', 'call', 'previous', 'job', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'previous', 'failures', 'refugees', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'excellent', 'educators', 'others', 'fail', 'again', 'Les', 'Choristes', 'known', 'Chorus', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'audience', 'introduced', 'one', 'refugees', 'embark', 'rough', 'voyage', 'taken', 'job', 'supervisor', 'boarding', 'school', 'troubled', 'children.Christophe', 'Barratier', 'who', 'Les', 'Choristes', 'previously', 'produced', 'excellent', 'films', 'such', 'Himalaya', '1999', 'Winged', 'Migration', '2001', 'story', 'Barratier', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'man', 'half', 'slumber', 'couch', 'when', 'someone', 'order', 'inform', 'emergency', 'phone', 'call', 'man', 'mother', 'just', 'passed', 'away', 'return', 'home', 'When', 'man', 'home', 'audience', 'can', 'deduct', 'mise-en-scene', 'man', 'best', 'conductor', 'world', 'funeral', 'strange', 'man', 'knocks', 'door', 'ask', 'conductor', 'gift', 'old', 'teacher', 'gift', 'journal', 'regards', 'what', 'happened', 'year', '1949', 'Fond', 'de', ""l'Etang"", 'boarding', 'school.The', 'journal', 'was', 'gift', 'old', 'teacher', 'Clement', 'Mathieu', 'Gerard', 'Jugnot', 'viewers', 'back', 'year', '1949', 'flashback', 'audience', 'introduced', 'school', 'students', 'teachers', 'headmaster', 'Rachin', 'story', 'take', 'form', 'school', 'designed', 'help', 'troubled', 'youth', 'get', 'right', 'track', 'too', 'late', 'many', 'students', 'Fond', 'de', ""l'Etang"", 'are', 'up', 'good', 'whenever', 'get', 'chance.Rachin', 'school', 'iron', 'fist', 'motto', 'action', 'reaction', 'lost', 'hope', 'children', 'ability', 'only', 'imperfections', 'children', 'Mathieu', 'quickly', 'psychology', 'Rachin', 'forced', 'punish', 'student', 'arrival', 'student', 'being', 'innocent', 'knowledge', 'road', 'gain', 'students', 'trust', 'long', 'difficult', 'road', 'more', 'so', 'get', 'follow', 'rules', 'set', 'up', 'However', 'compassion', 'self-irony', 'touch', 'humor', 'Mathieu', 'get', 'attention.Quickly', 'Mathieu', 'adjusts', 'school', 'environment', 'tryout', 'choir', 'choir', 'students', 'cooperate', 'build', 'meaningful', 'sense', 'belonging', 'educational', 'methods', 'Mathieu', 'win', 'students', 'over', 'begin', 'do', 'actual', 'work', 'showing', 'progress', 'Unfortunately', 'Rachin', 'music', 'way', 'students', 'express', 'negatively', 'dishonorably', 'Rachin', 'not', 'credit', 'Mathieu', 'students', 'progress', 'music', 'stop', 'choir', 'immediately', 'order', 'Rachin', 'students', 'go', 'underground', 'much', 'French', 'Resistance', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'order', 'continue', 'music', 'lessons', 'lessons', 'Mathieu', 'strong', 'bonds', 'students', 'trust', 'teaching', 'wisdom', 'music.The', 'theme', 'Les', 'Choristes', 'not', 'unique', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'films', 'such', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', '1989', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', '1995', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', '1995', 'Evil', '2003', 'stories', 'are', 'also', 'regarding', 'teachers', 'school', 'settings', 'change', 'students', 'lives', 'profound', 'way', 'film', 'mind', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', '1989', 'older', 'man', 'returning', 'home', 'bury', 'man', 'who', 'changed', 'life', 'Les', 'Choristes', 'blend', 'two', 'themes.Barratier', 'storytelling', 'elusively', 'audience', 'terrific', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'technical', 'aspects', 'filmmaking', 'are', 'reliable', 'shine', 'moments', 'when', 'necessary', 'elevate', 'mood', 'feeling', 'theme', 'been', 'used', 'still', 'powerful', 'essential', 'tool', 'expressing', 'gratitude', 'who', 'educate', 'youth', 'world', 'end', 'Les', 'truly', 'joyful', 'experience', 'hope', 'everywhere', 'one', 'only', 'see']",N/A
884083,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007NMJPO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","""Les Choristes"" (""The Chorus"") is a familiar story about a teacher that comes into a school and makes a difference for students that nobody else cares about.  Even when you narrow down the category to include teachers who use music you should be able to name enough movies in this genre to fill up at least one hand full of fingers.  In fact, the only thing that might make this 2004 film different from the others you have seen from ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" to ""Music of the Heart,"" is that it in French.  That is because ""Les Choristes"" takes place in France.At the start of this movie a man (Jacques Perrin) is awaken with news that someone has died.  We learn that the man is a great conductor and when he goes home for the funeral there is another man (Didier Flamand) waiting for him.  Many years ago they were students together at the Fond de l'Etang boarding school.  Although this is not the best of circumstances, the other man has something to share with the conductor.  The notebook of the man who was their teacher and who taught them how to sing.  The opening page of the notebook is a sketch of the entrance to their school and the drawing transforms into a camera shot and we are back to the beginning of our story.In 1949 Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) arrives at Fond de l'Etang to be the new prefect.  His introduction to the students is when Rachin (Franciois Berleand), the head of the school, is disciplining the entire school because no one will admit to being the one who injured one of the teachers with a prank.  Mathieu is a tad overweight and bald, so before the students even know his name they are calling him ""Chrome Dome.""  He knows even less about the boys, but clearly he does not like the way they are being treated and he takes a series of different approaches in dealing with them.  A failed musician, Mathieu hears the boys signing a derogatory song about them and uses that as the inspiration to create a chorus.  His motives are not exactly pure, because I think his primary goal at first is to hear his own music being sung.  But in time they move on to something more formidable (I think it was Jean-Phlippe Rameau's ""La Nuit"").Three of the students stand out.  Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), is one of the leaders of the boy and the least able to admit to having an interest in singing, but he has the voice of an angel.  Pepinot (Maxence Perrin) is one of the smallest boys and an orphan, who believes that his father will come for him on a Saturday.  The newcomer to the school is Mondain (Gregory Gatignol), a bully who is content to be hit over and over again because that is the world in which he lives.  I appreciated the fact that Mathieu does not save them all, and that his legacy is not only with hi students but with the other teachers at the school.  In a story that is fairly predictable, there is a grace note at the end that comes with what should be an unexpected turn of events.  Beyond that it is the earnestness of the performances that elevates ""Les Choristes"" above other films in this genre.  Your only complaint might be that you wish there was more singing from the boys once they get their act together.",5,A French film about one of those school teachers who makes a difference,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,3178,"['Les', 'Choristes', 'Chorus', 'familiar', 'story', 'teacher', 'school', 'difference', 'students', 'nobody', 'else', 'Even', 'when', 'narrow', 'down', 'category', 'include', 'teachers', 'who', 'use', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'name', 'enough', 'movies', 'genre', 'fill', 'up', 'least', 'one', 'hand', 'full', 'fingers', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'might', 'make', '2004', 'film', 'different', 'others', 'have', 'seen', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'Music', 'Heart', 'French', 'Les', 'Choristes', 'place', 'France.At', 'start', 'movie', 'man', 'Jacques', 'Perrin', 'awaken', 'news', 'someone', 'died', 'learn', 'man', 'great', 'conductor', 'when', 'home', 'funeral', 'man', 'Didier', 'Flamand', 'waiting', 'Many', 'years', 'were', 'students', 'together', 'Fond', 'de', ""l'Etang"", 'boarding', 'school', 'not', 'best', 'circumstances', 'other', 'man', 'something', 'share', 'conductor', 'notebook', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'teacher', 'who', 'taught', 'how', 'sing', 'opening', 'page', 'notebook', 'sketch', 'entrance', 'school', 'drawing', 'camera', 'shot', 'are', 'back', 'beginning', 'story.In', '1949', 'Clement', 'Mathieu', 'Gerard', 'Jugnot', 'Fond', 'de', ""l'Etang"", 'be', 'new', 'prefect', 'introduction', 'students', 'when', 'Rachin', 'Franciois', 'Berleand', 'head', 'school', 'disciplining', 'entire', 'school', 'one', 'will', 'admit', 'being', 'one', 'who', 'injured', 'one', 'teachers', 'prank', 'Mathieu', 'tad', 'overweight', 'bald', 'so', 'students', 'even', 'know', 'name', 'are', 'calling', 'Chrome', 'Dome', 'even', 'less', 'boys', 'clearly', 'not', 'way', 'are', 'being', 'treated', 'series', 'different', 'approaches', 'dealing', 'failed', 'musician', 'Mathieu', 'boys', 'signing', 'derogatory', 'song', 'inspiration', 'create', 'chorus', 'motives', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'pure', 'think', 'primary', 'goal', 'first', 'hear', 'own', 'music', 'being', 'sung', 'time', 'move', 'something', 'more', 'formidable', 'think', 'was', 'Jean-Phlippe', 'Rameau', 'La', 'Nuit', '.Three', 'students', 'stand', 'out', 'Pierre', 'Morhange', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Maunier', 'one', 'leaders', 'boy', 'least', 'able', 'admit', 'having', 'interest', 'singing', 'voice', 'angel', 'Pepinot', 'Maxence', 'Perrin', 'one', 'smallest', 'boys', 'orphan', 'who', 'father', 'will', 'come', 'Saturday', 'newcomer', 'school', 'Mondain', 'Gregory', 'Gatignol', 'bully', 'who', 'content', 'be', 'hit', 'over', 'again', 'world', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'Mathieu', 'not', 'save', 'legacy', 'not', 'only', 'hi', 'students', 'other', 'teachers', 'school', 'story', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'grace', 'note', 'end', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'events', 'earnestness', 'performances', 'Les', 'Choristes', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'only', 'complaint', 'might', 'be', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'singing', 'boys', 'once', 'get', 'act', 'together']",N/A

In the tradition of Cinema Paradiso (and just as good), this movie has a flashback style plot. One of the greatest conductors of the world recalls his life in a school for boys with problems. The movie deals with the not-so-new theme of education in 1949 Europe: traditional exaggerated discipine versus love, and the importance of trust. The new part: the fullfilment of a man's frustrated musical dreams through the conduction of a boy's chorus.The music?? Ah!! The music is so exquisite, it brings tears to your eyes. I bought the soundtrack as well and listen to it all the time, further appreciating the significance of the lyrics. The boy's voces are beautiful, as so are each and everyone of the characters. What differentiates this film from others which deal with the same theme (such as Mr Holland's Opus) is the director's excellence at making each and every one of the characters authentic and absolutely real. In the purest European cinematic tradition this movie deals with an ordinary theme making it extraordinary by means of excellent acting, casting and simplicity of plot: French cinema at its best! The bonus: the movie brings attention to the importance of musical education for the developmet of healthy children, and shows us once more how a correctly induced gift can end in a lifelong passion that will never make you lonely: music, music, music.

Data with no meaning for you right now, but that has a lot to do with this movie. What does that data mean?. Well, it is the place and time that set the background for this wonderful story.The country is France, and the date 1949, some years after the end of the Second World War. ""Fond de l'Etang"" is a strict school for troubled children, mostly orphans who have lost their parents in the war. They live more or less unhappy lives, wanting to play outside but forbidden to do so. They express themselves only through rebellious acts, to which the harsh director of the school responds on the basis of the principle ""action-reaction"". Unfortunately, that principle doesn't solve things...One day, the arrival of a new preceptor disturbs the school's routine. He is Clement Mathieu (G&eacute;rard Jugnot), a frustrated musician that has arrived to this school only after having failed at a variety of jobs, and who isn't overly excited at the prospect of having to deal with a bunch of unruly kids. Things don't start well, due to the fact that the students don't respect him, and that he doesn't agree with the director's ""educational"" methods. However, one day Mathieu listens the children singing out of tune, and realises that he can teach them to sing well. As he does so, trust begins to build between them, and the students start to face life in a different way...Clement Mathieu  kept a journal during the time he was at ""Fond de l'Etang"", and it is throughout his words that we are allowed to ""watch"" what happened. The films begins when one of Mathieu's previous pupils at ""Fond de l'Etang"" returns to his home due to the death of his mother. The man, now a famous music conductor, receives after the funeral the journal of his teacher, and begins to read it.This story doesn't seem to be overly special, but the film certainly is so. I cannot explain exactly why... Maybe the reason is that the director (Christophe Barratier) is very good, or that all the actors play their roles beautifully. Another important element that makes this a noteworthy film is, of course, the enchanting music that plays throughout the movie. Anyway, I think that you should just go to see ""The Chorus"" right now (if you can, run), and find your own reasons to love it  :)Belen Alcat",5,Music and hope ...,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,2307,"['Fond', 'de', ""l'Etang"", 'France', '1949', 'Data', 'meaning', 'right', 'now', 'lot', 'do', 'movie', 'What', 'data', 'mean', 'Well', 'place', 'time', 'set', 'background', 'wonderful', 'story.The', 'country', 'France', 'date', '1949', 'years', 'end', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Fond', 'de', ""l'Etang"", 'strict', 'school', 'troubled', 'children', 'mostly', 'orphans', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'parents', 'war', 'live', 'more', 'less', 'unhappy', 'lives', 'wanting', 'play', 'outside', 'forbidden', 'do', 'so', 'express', 'only', 'rebellious', 'acts', 'harsh', 'director', 'school', 'basis', 'principle', 'action-reaction', 'Unfortunately', 'principle', ""n't"", 'solve', 'things', 'One', 'day', 'arrival', 'new', 'preceptor', 'school', 'routine', 'Clement', 'Mathieu', 'G', 'eacute', 'Jugnot', 'frustrated', 'musician', 'arrived', 'school', 'only', 'having', 'failed', 'variety', 'jobs', 'who', ""n't"", 'overly', 'excited', 'prospect', 'having', 'deal', 'bunch', 'unruly', 'kids', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'well', 'due', 'fact', 'students', 'do', ""n't"", 'respect', ""n't"", 'agree', 'director', 'educational', 'methods', 'However', 'one', 'day', 'Mathieu', 'children', 'singing', 'tune', 'can', 'teach', 'sing', 'well', 'so', 'trust', 'begins', 'build', 'students', 'start', 'face', 'life', 'different', 'way', 'Clement', 'Mathieu', 'kept', 'journal', 'time', 'was', 'Fond', 'de', ""l'Etang"", 'words', 'are', 'allowed', 'watch', 'what', 'happened', 'films', 'when', 'one', 'Mathieu', 'previous', 'pupils', 'Fond', 'de', ""l'Etang"", 'returns', 'home', 'due', 'death', 'mother', 'man', 'now', 'famous', 'music', 'conductor', 'funeral', 'journal', 'teacher', 'read', 'it.This', 'story', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'overly', 'special', 'film', 'certainly', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'exactly', 'why', 'Maybe', 'reason', 'director', 'Christophe', 'Barratier', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'beautifully', 'important', 'element', 'noteworthy', 'film', 'course', 'enchanting', 'music', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'think', 'should', 'just', 'go', 'see', 'Chorus', 'right', 'now', 'can', 'run', 'find', 'own', 'reasons', 'love', 'Belen', 'Alcat']",N/A

884091,A12FLZREV32JOP,B0007NMJPO,Noelle Eiram,"[4, 4]","Les Choristes is a fairly lightweight French film which warms one's tummy. It is the tale of a sweet, funny professor (Cl&eacute;ment Mathieu played by G&eacute;rard Jugnot) who begins work at a troubled boys' boarding school. He miraculously brings these [very] unruly children into order with music. M Mathieu punishes misbehavior with useful and conscience activating tasks. Of course, the principal of the school is an irredeemable jerk who takes credit for Mathieu's successes after impeding him every step of the way. Ultimately, Mathieu inspires the children, discovers a true talent, learns from the children, and [insert all sorts of wonderful things].I took off one point because the quickness with which Cl&eacute;ment turns delinquents into a boys choir is, shall we say, implausable. Here and there are a few plot holes that create a few uneven characters. Also, it is easy to guess that this film is a tad formulaic.Still, there are so many reasons to recommend this movie to movie lovers. The acting, for example, is lovely, as are many characterizations. G&eacute;rard Jugnot is so fine as the music teacher, the art of his acting didn't even cross my mind. Jean-Baptiste Maunier plays Pierre Morhange, a mysterious and melancholy boy-prodigy. Though Morhange is never fully explained, Maunier creates an intriguing character. To describe his voice as angelic is a cliche that must be repeated. For some reason, all my girlfriends (who are a few years older than he is) had a crush on him. Creepy, but it must be the brooding French-ness, voice, and also angelic face.The boys are all genuinely adorable. La P&egrave;re Maxence played by Jean-Paul Bonnaire is another caring character in the form of an old janitor (I believe) at the school.Being French lightweight, Les Choristes still has several unsettling moments and characters. Gr&eacute;gory Gatignol is excellent as Mondain, a disturbed boy who is probably the only character (other than the headmaster) who is too far to be reached. His character doesn't have a huge impact on the story, though, and his story is only subtley and briefly developed.On a better note: listen to that music. I bet you'll be overcome with ""awwws"" and chills (unless such sweetness makes you nauseous).To sum it up, I knew my heart strings were being pulled.

There's plenty of evidence from French cinema that boys schools were rough places and not really much different from reformatories. Here the amenties are few and the rules are many, and the school itself looks like it barely survived WWII.G&eacute;rard Jugnot, a kind of sweetly tempered Wally Shawn, dubbed ""Chrome Dome"" from his first day on the job, delivers a lovingly nuanced performance of a teacher who understands how it's a mistake to make adversaries of students - they simply outnumber you - and to win them over by basically making deals with them, in which both of you have something to gain. He must play a careful balancing act between his own best instincts and the authoritarian headmaster, whose action-reaction school of discipline has all the boys seething with resentment and rebellion. But the boys find themselves drawn by curiosity into becoming a chorus, performing their teacher's own compositions. They finally triumph at a command performance before an aristocratic benefactor. Which is not to say all ends well, but anyone who has ever been a teacher will find much to recognize and celebrate in this charming film.",5,Angels with dirty faces . . .,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,1373,"['gentle', 'movie', 'set', 'French', 'provinces', '1949', 'mixes', 'kind', 'postwar', 'neorealism', 'sentimental', 'story', 'choir', 'master', 'boys', 'school', 'who', 'hearts', 'minds', 'unruly', 'band', 'delinquents', 'orphans', 'plenty', 'evidence', 'French', 'cinema', 'schools', 'were', 'rough', 'places', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'different', 'reformatories', 'Here', 'amenties', 'are', 'few', 'rules', 'are', 'many', 'school', 'barely', 'survived', 'WWII.G', 'eacute', 'Jugnot', 'kind', 'sweetly', 'tempered', 'Wally', 'Shawn', 'dubbed', 'Chrome', 'Dome', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'lovingly', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'teacher', 'who', 'how', 'mistake', 'make', 'adversaries', 'students', 'simply', 'outnumber', 'win', 'over', 'basically', 'making', 'deals', 'have', 'something', 'gain', 'must', 'play', 'careful', 'balancing', 'act', 'own', 'best', 'instincts', 'authoritarian', 'headmaster', 'action-reaction', 'school', 'discipline', 'boys', 'seething', 'resentment', 'rebellion', 'boys', 'find', 'drawn', 'curiosity', 'becoming', 'chorus', 'performing', 'teacher', 'own', 'compositions', 'finally', 'triumph', 'command', 'performance', 'aristocratic', 'benefactor', 'Which', 'not', 'say', 'ends', 'well', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'teacher', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'recognize', 'celebrate', 'charming', 'film']",N/A

I watched it (cried it) the first time a week ago and I've seen it 3 more times since that. Yes, as a choral conductor  I've witnessed, I've promoted  I`ve seen the miracle of choral music doing what many other aspects of ""education"" just can't do today. Why would that be? It may sound harsh, but many schools and many fields of ""education"" have turned into plain business all around, just preocupied with ""manufacturing"" consumers for the market world, as John Holt once said, no matter how this is acieved. Obviously, we're talking here about 1949: the post war times of this story, we all know,  were very hard, sick with so many missconceptions about ""discipline"" and ""order"". But this globalized times with new nazis like Mr. Bush, Blair or Berlusconi are not so different. Children feel all that violence and , deep within them, they resent it. Art, on the contrary,  and choral music in particular, was then and still is now  a deep language of the soul and no kid is alien to it as long as a true artist helps him discover it. This is obviously, the very foundation behind Europe's old and solid choral culture. So, this is what Mr. Mathew does with this group of lonely and abandoned kids so abused by the hard, stupid ways of Mr. Rachin. They come to discover their true souls through the power of music. As an artist, Mr Mathew knows this and goes for it with love and faith.The story is beautifully put to screen, somehow reminding us of the classic films by Truffaut. The Saint Marc kids chorus is an A-1 group with a lovely head voice sound and, not only Rameaus piece, but all selections by Bruno Coulais are lovely.It goes without saying that as a musician I'm really pleased to know that today's kids may have a chance of enjoying a film such as this one.

It shows how to deal with the subject without overplaying it and thus destroying the subject. This shows the person who is a musician taking the job as a prefect in a reformatory school and slowly bringing out the students using music. The beauty is in how simple the theme is and how well it is played out, showing all kinds of students and teachers. The basic logic is that music does not pay except for some of the best or the luckiest. The rest of them become teachers or choose other professions. The music is well directed and wonderfully acted by the lead actor Gerard Jugnot. Unlike other movies, the end is realistic with the teacher getting fired and moving to another place. Having seen the Vienna Boys Choir, this movie captured my heart. The spirit of the movie is in the way to capture the mind and the hearts of the boys. While there are some violent parts, for the most part it was a lovely movie which I enjoyed. It had humour, spirit, understanding and forgiveness done beautifully. The ending was simple and elegant.I would like to mention that it it not like Mr Holland's Opus or like Dead Poets Society. Robin Williams cannot play the part of the teacher, he is one of the persons who plays the same role in all his movies and overplays his part. Mr Holland's Opus has an unlikely end with all of his former students giving him a farewell. The music is also not as beautiful.

884106,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007NMJPO,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","'The Chorus' became a huge hit in France in 2004, and there's a good reason for that.  Despite some obvious flaws, the film is moving and uplifting as any good music is, and anyone who likes films like 'Dead Poets Society' will surely love this one too.The theme of the film is nothing new, but quite universal.  A middle-aged music teacher Matthew is sent to a school.  The setting is post-war France, and we find the educational environment there is worse than Matthew expected -- the pupils are rebellious and the headmaster is strict.  To adjust to the new situation, Matthew, himself a failed musician, thinks of organizing the kids into a chorus group.That's it, and the story of the film is certainly predictable.  The boys at first make a fool of the new teacher, and then starts to listen, revealing their brilliant singing voices.  Among them, one handsome and quiet boy Morhange (newcomer Jean-Baptiste Maunier who really sings here) turns out the best singer, who is given the solo part.The film (written and directed by first-timer Christophe Barratier) goes smooth, and for some critics, goes too smoothly.  In fact, some accused the film of being too sentimental.  Maybe so.  But I for one think that the film is made with honest heart, with humanities enough to convince the sincerity of the filmmakers and actors.  Sentimental or not, what really counts is good acting, good story, good characters, and good music.  And the good music is as moving as the story itself.  What else do you want?Jacques Perrin appears as grown-up Morhange (in the same way he did in 'Cinema Paradiso'), and he is also one of the producers of the film.  The little boy 'Pepinot' (waiting for Saturdays to come) is played by Maxence Perrin, his real-life son.  The chorus part is supplied by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc.So you want to see a good film?  Here's the one for you.  I don't say it's perfect.

As has already been said by thousands of viewers already, this film is about a man who goes into a teaching career after his failure of being a professional musician, not realizing the journey that is yet to come when he learns just as much from these delinquent children as they do from him. Sure, this film doesn't go into unknown territory, there have been plenty of tales about a teacher and bad kids who learn from each other about the beauty and importance of life and learning.

884109,A1C80B497LCYKA,B0007NMJPO,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[2, 2]","In this masterful effort by first-time director Christophe Barratier, the new prefect at a school for troubled boys decides to start a chorus, against the cruel headmaster's warnings. It seems just the thing to give the boys purpose and unity. But then a true juvenile delinquent is enrolled as an experiment, and he upsets everyone's world and even sabotages the chorus.Gerard Jugnot is wonderful as Clement Mathieu, the prefect, whose heart for the boys and love of music holds the whole piece together. Jean-Baptiste Maunier plays Pierre Morhange, an exceptionally talented boy in whom Mathieu takes special interest, and who is telling the story as an adult. Marie Bunel plays Pierre's single mother, with whom Mathieu is smitten, and of whom Pierre is ashamed because the other boys tease him about her beauty. Francois Berleand plays the dapper but unfeeling headmaster Rachin.There is an often repeated philosophical maxim at the school: action-reaction. Rachin uses this concept to show the boys that whenever they do something wrong, there will be a negative reaction, often in the form of ""lock-up."" Mathieu goes against this system by showing the boys love. It is his love that wins them over to his way of thinking, while Rachin's methods only alienated them and made them worse. The boys see that Mathieu is on their side, so the chorus grows and blossoms, as do the boys.Mathieu writes all the music the boys sing, and it is wonderful, especially the solos by Pierre. He has a beautiful soprano voice. This is a very touching, heart-warming film, but there are some rough moments. It isn't easy converting a prison to a boys' home. Anyone that loves music, boys, education and seeing how love can change someone's life will love Les Choristes.Waitsel Smith",5,"GORGEOUS MUSIC, WONDERFUL HEART",1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,1770,"['masterful', 'effort', 'first-time', 'director', 'Christophe', 'Barratier', 'new', 'prefect', 'school', 'troubled', 'boys', 'decides', 'start', 'chorus', 'cruel', 'headmaster', 'warnings', 'just', 'thing', 'give', 'boys', 'purpose', 'unity', 'then', 'true', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'enrolled', 'experiment', 'everyone', 'world', 'even', 'chorus.Gerard', 'Jugnot', 'wonderful', 'Clement', 'Mathieu', 'prefect', 'heart', 'boys', 'love', 'music', 'whole', 'piece', 'together', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Maunier', 'Pierre', 'Morhange', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'boy', 'whom', 'Mathieu', 'special', 'interest', 'who', 'telling', 'story', 'adult', 'Marie', 'Bunel', 'Pierre', 'single', 'mother', 'whom', 'Mathieu', 'smitten', 'whom', 'Pierre', 'ashamed', 'other', 'boys', 'tease', 'beauty', 'Francois', 'Berleand', 'dapper', 'unfeeling', 'headmaster', 'Rachin.There', 'often', 'repeated', 'philosophical', 'maxim', 'school', 'action-reaction', 'Rachin', 'concept', 'show', 'boys', 'whenever', 'do', 'something', 'wrong', 'will', 'be', 'negative', 'reaction', 'often', 'form', 'lock-up', 'Mathieu', 'system', 'showing', 'boys', 'love', 'love', 'over', 'way', 'thinking', 'Rachin', 'methods', 'only', 'alienated', 'made', 'worse', 'boys', 'see', 'Mathieu', 'side', 'chorus', 'grows', 'blossoms', 'do', 'boys.Mathieu', 'music', 'boys', 'sing', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'solos', 'Pierre', 'beautiful', 'soprano', 'voice', 'very', 'touching', 'heart-warming', 'film', 'are', 'rough', 'moments', ""n't"", 'easy', 'converting', 'prison', 'boys', 'home', 'Anyone', 'music', 'education', 'seeing', 'how', 'love', 'can', 'change', 'someone', 'life', 'will', 'love', 'Les', 'Choristes.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
