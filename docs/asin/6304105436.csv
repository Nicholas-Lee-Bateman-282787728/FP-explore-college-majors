401162,A27T7FAONDX6VI,6304105436,"Chris ""Chris906""","[0, 0]","'Andersonville' is a really fine film made about the infamous prison camps. It has a group of characters that the viewer can identify with and also contains very good acting. I think the twin story lines in the film are handled excellently. The storyline on trying to tunnel out of the prison is handled excellently and contains very interesting details on a operation of this kind. The other story line where the characters have to take on the camp bullies 'The Raiders' is also handled excellently by director John Frankenheimer. I find these scenes to be some of my favorite of the films because of the classic clash of good vs evil.The film also does not sugarcoat the terrible conditions in the prison but I don't think the filmmakers blame it all on Wirz. What happened in Civil War prisons was truly awful and I really don't think excuses should be made by either side. There should have been something done by both sides to alleviate the horrible suffering of POWs from both sides.Also, the film has a very authentic look and is very true to the actual layout of the Andersonville prison.The DVD has good visuals and sound plus two interesting commentary tracks.I would recommend viewers to visit Andersonville National Historic site in Georgia today. It is an excellent site, very well preserved and interpreted. The site has an excellent museum on all the POWs of America's wars. The cemetery is awe-inspiring, just as it is in the movie. I find it one of the most moving places in the entire United States. It is different than the battlefields. There is a sadness in the ground at Andersonville and if there are ghosts I truly think they are still at Andersonville. The site of Andersonville Prison is a place you will never forget.Highly recommended!I would also recommend reading the account of Andersonville contained in William Marvel's book 'Andersonville The Last Depot' that helps separate some of the fact and fiction that is presented in the film.",5,One of the great films on the American Civil War,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1968,"['really', 'fine', 'film', 'made', 'infamous', 'prison', 'camps', 'group', 'characters', 'viewer', 'can', 'identify', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'think', 'twin', 'story', 'lines', 'film', 'are', 'handled', 'excellently', 'storyline', 'trying', 'tunnel', 'prison', 'handled', 'excellently', 'very', 'interesting', 'details', 'operation', 'kind', 'other', 'story', 'line', 'where', 'characters', 'have', 'take', 'camp', 'Raiders', 'also', 'handled', 'excellently', 'director', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'find', 'scenes', 'be', 'favorite', 'films', 'classic', 'clash', 'good', 'vs', 'evil.The', 'film', 'also', 'not', 'sugarcoat', 'terrible', 'conditions', 'prison', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'filmmakers', 'blame', 'Wirz', 'What', 'happened', 'Civil', 'War', 'prisons', 'was', 'truly', 'awful', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'excuses', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'side', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'done', 'sides', 'alleviate', 'horrible', 'suffering', 'POWs', 'sides.Also', 'film', 'very', 'authentic', 'look', 'very', 'true', 'actual', 'layout', 'Andersonville', 'prison.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'visuals', 'sound', 'two', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'tracks.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewers', 'visit', 'Andersonville', 'National', 'Historic', 'site', 'Georgia', 'today', 'excellent', 'site', 'very', 'well', 'preserved', 'interpreted', 'site', 'excellent', 'museum', 'POWs', 'America', 'wars', 'cemetery', 'awe-inspiring', 'just', 'movie', 'find', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'places', 'entire', 'United', 'States', 'different', 'battlefields', 'sadness', 'ground', 'Andersonville', 'are', 'ghosts', 'truly', 'think', 'are', 'still', 'Andersonville', 'site', 'Andersonville', 'Prison', 'place', 'will', 'never', 'forget.Highly', 'recommended', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'reading', 'account', 'Andersonville', 'contained', 'William', 'Marvel', 'book', 'Last', 'Depot', 'separate', 'fact', 'fiction', 'presented', 'film']",Andersonville VHS

Therefore, the Raiders are not guilty of breaking any law"", ""these are desperate times and desperate measures are required to survive"", ""only rebel law applies in the prison"".  Outcries from other Union soldiers were heard, ""we suffered the same hardships and did not yield to survival tactics.  What about us?""  Prosecution deflected the rebel law argument by appealing to justice stating there were certain rights and protections guaranteed to all men: 1. protection against murder 2. protection against theft.  The military jury found the six Raider leader guilty and the punishment affixed as death by hanging.  The union soldiers lived by law and law made the men civilized.  Mob rule only works while the majority tolerates the theft;  however, once intolerance levels are hit,  a violent revolution transpires.  The raiders could not fight the majority and probably would have all been murdered with out a trial.  However, the majority gained their whit and requested and were granted a trial to prosecute the Raiders.The ""Great Escape"" with McQueen probably took its plot from Andersonville.  The story line had a ton of similarities.Andersonville has a fair share of violence.  At one point the directors portrays the prisoners as Zoombies, in the land, of the walking dead.  Scurvy symptoms increased the graphic repulsiveness, in an attempt to balance the audience sympathy, abhorrence of the injustices, and despair of the troops.  Heroism abounds, leaders reject traitorous offers to defect, form their regiment, about face, and march away from on looking Confederate Admiral making offer.  Factually, 45,000 men were imprisoned and about 13,000 died from starvation, disease, and crime.  Inhuman treatment of prisoner included lack of drinkable water, over crowding of the prisoners, no prisoner exchange, and looting.  Andersonville has a fairly high entertainment value, as a civil war movie.

401166,APUHDIL2CEI3C,6304105436,Dr. Victor S. Alpher,"[10, 11]","After looking at some of the reviews, I'll admit I'm a bit confused.  I think this was made AFTER Gettysburg so any motivation of remorse couldn't have had much to do with ""Andersonville""....As a younger Civil War/War of Northern Aggression student, I read MacKinlay Kantor's book ""Andersonville"" and while there is much vile to see in this film, it does show why the written word is still the most powerful weapon in war.  Kantor's descriptions in writing defy depiction by even the most skilled set-dresser.  And nobody, I mean nobody, Federal or Confederate, officer or enlisted man, young or old can come out a situation such as Andersonville looking particularly well--and the post-liberation photographs show it, just as do the post-liberation photographs of Auschwitz, Dachau, and Bergen-Belsen.  The German film of the 1950s ""The Doctor of Stalingrad"" which purported to show conditions in a German POW camp in the Soviet Union after World War II, and the great film ""Hart's War"" depict relative Shangri-La conditions...For someone who knows little about the POW situation during this great American conflict, I would recommend the DVD ""Andersonville"" but NOT in isolation.  It must be tempered with a rounded knowledge of conditions in Northern Camps--which DO appear on the History Channel regularly...and recognition that after prisoner exchange was discontinued, nothing short of genocide on a fairly grand scale could result.I recall a television documentary about the trial of the Andersonville Commander, whic starred of all people William Shatner--back in the 1970s or so...which I was quite impressed with and should be resurrected.  But for the present, films such as ""Andersonville"" are replete with underlying messages about the horrors of war, that humans make war and then complain about the conditions which are inevitable, and that despite our intelligence we have not found an alternative to it--yet.  If this film inspires one intellect to put his or her head to the solution of this problem, then there will be no more Andersonvilles....This film shows how easily humans who are civilized (we think) can descend into the psychosocial dynamics of the crowd, the group, the herd, plundering and devaluing of human life to that of mere livestock.",5,Who Looks Good in a Film about POW Camps?,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,2270,"['looking', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'bit', 'confused', 'think', 'was', 'made', 'AFTER', 'Gettysburg', 'so', 'motivation', 'remorse', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'Andersonville', 'younger', 'Civil', 'War/War', 'Northern', 'Aggression', 'student', 'read', 'MacKinlay', 'Kantor', 'book', 'Andersonville', 'much', 'vile', 'see', 'film', 'show', 'why', 'written', 'word', 'still', 'most', 'powerful', 'weapon', 'war', 'Kantor', 'descriptions', 'writing', 'defy', 'depiction', 'even', 'most', 'skilled', 'set-dresser', 'nobody', 'mean', 'nobody', 'Federal', 'Confederate', 'officer', 'enlisted', 'man', 'young', 'old', 'can', 'come', 'out', 'situation', 'such', 'Andersonville', 'looking', 'particularly', 'well', 'post-liberation', 'photographs', 'show', 'just', 'do', 'post-liberation', 'photographs', 'Auschwitz', 'Dachau', 'Bergen-Belsen', 'German', 'film', '1950s', 'Doctor', 'Stalingrad', 'purported', 'show', 'conditions', 'German', 'POW', 'camp', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'great', 'film', 'Hart', 'War', 'depict', 'relative', 'Shangri-La', 'conditions', 'someone', 'who', 'little', 'POW', 'situation', 'great', 'American', 'conflict', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Andersonville', 'NOT', 'isolation', 'must', 'be', 'tempered', 'rounded', 'knowledge', 'conditions', 'Northern', 'Camps', 'DO', 'appear', 'History', 'Channel', 'regularly', 'recognition', 'prisoner', 'exchange', 'was', 'discontinued', 'nothing', 'short', 'genocide', 'fairly', 'grand', 'scale', 'could', 'result.I', 'recall', 'television', 'documentary', 'trial', 'Andersonville', 'Commander', 'whic', 'starred', 'people', 'William', 'Shatner', 'back', '1970s', 'so', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'should', 'be', 'resurrected', 'present', 'films', 'such', 'Andersonville', 'are', 'replete', 'underlying', 'messages', 'horrors', 'war', 'humans', 'make', 'war', 'then', 'complain', 'conditions', 'are', 'inevitable', 'intelligence', 'have', 'not', 'found', 'alternative', 'yet', 'film', 'one', 'intellect', 'put', 'head', 'solution', 'problem', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'Andersonvilles', '.This', 'film', 'how', 'easily', 'humans', 'who', 'are', 'civilized', 'think', 'can', 'descend', 'psychosocial', 'dynamics', 'crowd', 'group', 'herd', 'plundering', 'devaluing', 'human', 'life', 'mere', 'livestock']",Andersonville VHS

I feel that in studying the Civil War a student could learn so much about politics, human nature, racism, families, economics, strategy, tactics, management, leadership, courage, initiative, tact, morality, friendship, compassion, inovation, health, irony.  And the list just goes on and on.The more that I learn about the Civil War the more amazed I become at how totally untrue many of the assumptions that I had about our most crucial conflict are.To clarify.  It was economics and stupidity that had more of an impact on the conditions in many civil war prison camps be they Union or Confederate.  Particularly at Andersonville a better and seperate sewage system could have been set up.  The men were forced to drink from the same water source that was used for human waste.  And certain actions that may have been viewed as just acts of cruelty were in reality simple economic facts of life.  For example the Confederacy was economically devistated by the war.  They barely had enough food to feed their own troops let alone the thousands of prisoners.  Cruelty had little to do with that fact.It should also be noted that conditions in many Union (northern) prison camps were just as deplorable.I particularly appreciated how the indignation of the Union soldiers came out when they were informed that prisoner exchanges had ceased because the Confederacy would not treat black prisoners like white ones.  In short many Union soldiers had no great love for blacks just like their southern counterparts.Horrific, graphic, and intense.

The camp is a huge stockade, built for 20,000 prisoners of war, but is filled to overcrowding with over 35,000 Union POW's, and more arriving daily.  The conditions are horrible beyond words, virtually no food, no sanitation, clothing in rags and tatters, no shelter from the rain, gangs rampaging through the camp, rampant disease, a hundred men dying a day - a literal hell on earth.  Puported to be historical fact, the story centers on a brigade from Massachusetts and their struggle to survive, and what a horrendous struggle it is.  Other reviewers have stated that the story is not entirely truthful. Due to the shortage of critical supplies in the south, I do not doubt that the deporable conditions existed exactly as depicted in the movie. I cannot comment on other issues as I have not read the book that the movie is based on.  Truthful or not, the film is absolutely riveting! You will be shocked by the condition of the men, the violence in the camp, the slow agony of starvation, and the inevitable deline in the men, both physically and spiritually.The film has no well-known ""star"" actors, but even so, the various actors perform marvelously.  Their characterizations are as real as if they were really in the camp and suffering unto death.This film was an eye-opener for me, for I never considered the fate of Civil War POW's.

It is a tragic story of men placed in inhuman conditions where approximately one-third of them would perish.  There was little food, no clean water save rainwater, horrendous overcrowding, disease, crime, and brutality.  The German POW camps for allied prisoners had a far better survival rate than did Andersonville. (Not to be confused with the Nazi concentration camps.)This story takes the position that while much blame for the terrible conditions was due to Southern shortages of food and supplies, a principal cause was sheer brutality of the Southern prison administration.  I do not know if this is true; some reviewers here state that such is not the case.  It is true that late in the Civil War both sides had a great deal of animus, particularly in the South since most of the war and devastation took place there.  Thus, it is plausible that bad feeling between guards and prisoners led to the abuse depicted here.This is largely a tragic and downbeat story, with some moments of uplifting drama.

401192,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6304105436,Trevor Willsmer,"[2, 2]","In the wake of the critical and commercial success of A Man For All Seasons, Fred Zinnemann unsuccessfully attempted to use his post-Oscar clout to make a film about the atrocities at the infamous Confederate Civil War prison camp where 12,912 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease, but as many others had found out before him, studio chiefs didn't think it was the sort of thing to reverse declining cinema attendance and pulled the plug before a frame was shot. There had been a small-scale early TV play about the post-war trial of the officer in charge but it wasn't until Ted Turner's success with Gettysburg that a full-scale dramatization of life inside the stockade made it to the screen, and then only on the small one. The biggest name on the credits of Andersonville is director John Frankenheimer, then going through something of a critical comeback returning to the medium that first brought him to prominence: the cast is good, but it's more a case of a few familiar faces rather than big stars - Frederic Forrest, Cliff de Young, William Sanderson, William H. Macey - among a cast largely made up of little-known actors. Yet it's very clear that a lot of money has been spent, and that it's been made on a truly epic scale. Rarely has the old copywriters' pitch `a cast of thousands' seemed more appropriate as almost every scene boasts swathes of re-enactors to fill out the overcrowded prison.Despite being made for television it never looks threadbare and it never feels like its playing down the ugliness of the situation in the name of taste or network censorship even if it doesn't dwell on the details as much as it could. Built for 8000 but ending up housing 45,000, Andersonville itself was little more than a cattle pen: no barracks, a fetid stream, a lot of mud and far too many inmates surrounded by a wall and watchtowers, it didn't take much to turn it into a festering hellhole, with rations often withheld by the commander, water so rancid that inmates had to wring rainwater from their clothes to avoid fever, child guards daring prisoners to cross the `dead line' so they could kill them for a bounty and prisoners forming gangs to prey on and often kill each other. Even Confederate officials regarded it as `a disgrace to civilization.' In a war as ugly as the one between the States, it's some measure of how bad things were that the only man convicted and executed for war crimes in the entire Civil War was the commander of Andersonville.As drama it's fairly straightforward, following a group of new arrivals through their first days in the camp to the time those few who survive leave, taking in many of the expected conventions of the prison movie en route - escape attempts, futile deaths, dashed hopes and a near-riot. At times it does threaten to turn into a Civil War version of a WW2 P.O.W. movie, but it's held back from the pitfalls of great escapism by the fact that where many of those films often naively showed German prison camps as virtual holiday camps where the inmates tried to escape almost as a game, Andersonville makes it clear that here attempting to escape is seen as the only alternative to dying in squalor and pain. While there are few surprises, it's executed with real conviction, Frankenheimer's superb direction complemented by excellent photography from Ric Waite and production design by Michael Z. Hanan. That said, it is annoying that Warners' DVD has been needlessly cropped from fullframe into 1.85:1 widescreen, a reverse cropping that is just as bad as panning-and-scanning widescreen films into fullframe. While most of the 167 minutes it's not too damaging, there are some close-ups that become way too tight at times, although it's generally only a momentary distraction.",4,Another name for Hell,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,3768,"['wake', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'A', 'Man', 'All', 'Seasons', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'unsuccessfully', 'attempted', 'use', 'post-Oscar', 'clout', 'make', 'film', 'atrocities', 'infamous', 'Confederate', 'Civil', 'War', 'prison', 'camp', 'where', '12,912', 'Union', 'prisoners', 'war', 'died', 'starvation', 'disease', 'many', 'others', 'had', 'found', 'out', 'studio', 'chiefs', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'sort', 'thing', 'reverse', 'declining', 'cinema', 'attendance', 'pulled', 'plug', 'frame', 'was', 'shot', 'had', 'been', 'small-scale', 'early', 'TV', 'play', 'post-war', 'trial', 'officer', 'charge', 'was', ""n't"", 'Ted', 'Turner', 'success', 'Gettysburg', 'full-scale', 'dramatization', 'life', 'stockade', 'made', 'screen', 'then', 'only', 'small', 'one', 'biggest', 'name', 'credits', 'Andersonville', 'director', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'then', 'going', 'something', 'critical', 'comeback', 'returning', 'medium', 'first', 'brought', 'prominence', 'cast', 'good', 'more', 'case', 'few', 'familiar', 'rather', 'big', 'stars', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'Cliff', 'de', 'Young', 'William', 'Sanderson', 'William', 'H.', 'Macey', 'cast', 'largely', 'made', 'little-known', 'actors', 'very', 'clear', 'lot', 'money', 'been', 'spent', 'been', 'made', 'truly', 'epic', 'scale', 'Rarely', 'old', 'copywriters', 'pitch', 'cast', 'thousands', 'seemed', 'more', 'appropriate', 'almost', 'scene', 'swathes', 're-enactors', 'fill', 'out', 'overcrowded', 'prison.Despite', 'being', 'made', 'television', 'never', 'threadbare', 'never', 'playing', 'down', 'ugliness', 'situation', 'name', 'taste', 'network', 'censorship', 'even', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'details', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'Built', '8000', 'ending', 'up', 'housing', '45,000', 'Andersonville', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'cattle', 'pen', 'barracks', 'fetid', 'stream', 'lot', 'mud', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'inmates', 'surrounded', 'wall', 'watchtowers', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'turn', 'festering', 'hellhole', 'rations', 'often', 'withheld', 'commander', 'water', 'so', 'inmates', 'had', 'wring', 'rainwater', 'clothes', 'avoid', 'fever', 'child', 'guards', 'daring', 'prisoners', 'cross', 'dead', 'line', 'could', 'kill', 'bounty', 'prisoners', 'forming', 'gangs', 'prey', 'often', 'kill', 'other', 'Even', 'Confederate', 'officials', 'regarded', 'disgrace', 'civilization', 'war', 'as', 'ugly', 'one', 'States', 'measure', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'were', 'only', 'man', 'convicted', 'executed', 'war', 'crimes', 'entire', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'commander', 'Andersonville.As', 'drama', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'following', 'group', 'new', 'arrivals', 'first', 'days', 'camp', 'time', 'few', 'who', 'survive', 'leave', 'taking', 'many', 'expected', 'conventions', 'prison', 'movie', 'route', 'escape', 'attempts', 'futile', 'deaths', 'dashed', 'hopes', 'near-riot', 'times', 'threaten', 'turn', 'Civil', 'War', 'version', 'WW2', 'P.O.W', 'movie', 'held', 'back', 'pitfalls', 'great', 'escapism', 'fact', 'where', 'many', 'films', 'often', 'naively', 'showed', 'German', 'prison', 'camps', 'virtual', 'holiday', 'camps', 'where', 'inmates', 'tried', 'escape', 'almost', 'game', 'Andersonville', 'clear', 'here', 'attempting', 'escape', 'seen', 'only', 'alternative', 'dying', 'squalor', 'pain', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'executed', 'real', 'conviction', 'Frankenheimer', 'superb', 'direction', 'complemented', 'excellent', 'photography', 'Ric', 'Waite', 'production', 'design', 'Michael', 'Z.', 'Hanan', 'said', 'annoying', 'Warners', 'DVD', 'been', 'needlessly', 'cropped', 'fullframe', '1.85:1', 'widescreen', 'reverse', 'cropping', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'panning-and-scanning', 'widescreen', 'films', 'fullframe', 'most', '167', 'minutes', 'not', 'too', 'damaging', 'are', 'close-ups', 'become', 'way', 'too', 'tight', 'times', 'generally', 'only', 'momentary', 'distraction']",Andersonville VHS

401194,A3373I4II32NA1,6304105436,Tyler,"[5, 5]","This movie is perhaps the best account ever made on what prison life was like for more than the 40,000 Yankee enlisted soldiers who were imprisoned at Andersonville Prison in southwest Georgia from 1864 to 1865, 13,000 of which died in captivity from starvation, brutal treatment, disease, and even savage beatings inflicted by the criminal minds of their own side that had been thrown into the draft.Up until then, Yankees and Confederates mostly just had temporary camps to hold prisoners for as little as a few weeks before they would be exchanged. But by the spring of 1864, newly-promoted General-in-Chief Grant decided to stop exchanges for good, therefore holding tens of thousands of prisoners in camps on both sides. The Yankee prisoners would starve because the Confederate nation of almost a dozen Southern states, threatened on all sides by marauding Yankee armies, didn't have enough food and supplies to feed their own civilian population and armies, much less tens of thousands of Yankee prisoners. This I can truly understand. If any food was to be available, it would preferably go off to their own families and soldiers, and the POW's would get whatever was left, which wasn't very much.This movie follows the story of what appears to be about a company of Massachusetts troops who were captured during a skirmish with the other side on June 1, 1864 near Cold Harbor, Virginia, right before the slaughter of almost 7,000 Yankees was to happen on that ground within the next few days. You see the officers being separated from the enlisted men, and the officers were to be taken to Libby Prison in Richmond, the infamous camp for all Yankee officers in captivity. Upon their arrival at Andersonville, the men meet Captain Wirz, the Swiss-born Confederate commander of the prison who almost lost his arm at the 1862 battle of Fair Oaks. Wirz would end up being the only Confederate soldier executed for ""war crimes"" a few months after the war finally ended. He gives brutal treatment to the Yankees that attempt to escape from prison, many of which on record happened to do successfully, and this treatment brings much protest from a visiting Confederate colonel from the War Department. In the prison, a fellow soldier from their regiment that had been presumed dead since Antietam gives the arrivals great advice: Don't drink the diseased water from the spring, stay away from the Yankee Raiders that manage to rob the new arrivals of anything they have, and collect rainwater by wringing out their clothes during a downpour. Soon, the brutal treatment by the Raiders brings the whole camp into an uproar, and as the Confederate guards watch with fascination, the entire camp gives the Raiders some much-needed justice, followed by a trial and execution.The Yankees also adapt themselves to building escape tunnels under the camp, helped by a couple of former miners from Pennsylvania, and you find out what happens to the ""tunnel traitor"" Yankees who hope to give this information to the Confederate guards for as little as an extra piece of bread. The prison life looks very harsh and you see many of the prisoners die, but it was simply a way of life for survival for those that lived.

It is a moving and sad story of one of the most infamous Civil War prisonsin our American history. I discovered in my genealogical researches the past forty years that a distant cousin of mine, with the same exact first and last name as myself, barely survived his imprisonment at Andersonville, Georgia. History enthusiasts will fully enjoy- and made fully aware- of the powerful influence the Civil War still has on us 145 years later. As for myself, I was born in Elmira, N.Y., my dad's hometown. Elmira was a northern prison camp, and as horrible as Andersonville. I read a book on the Elmira camp, and it was in operation during 1864-65, the same time as Andersonville. I salute the gallant men who suffered and died, or barely survived, both camps. Ironically, the Elmira camp had formally been a Union training camp in 1861, when my own great great grandfather, age 17, entered as a Union private and fought, then severely wounded in McClellen's Peninsula Campaign in spring and summer of 1862. I was glad to have visited the Battlefields of the historic Peninsula Campaign in 2008.
