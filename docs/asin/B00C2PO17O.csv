1641549,A3V9QPX94E6GQG,B00C2PO17O,BDecker,"[1, 1]",My daughter has two Pajanimals books that she received in her kids meals at a fast food restaurant so when we put on the Pajama Party DVD she was already familiar with the characters.  She asks that I play the DVD at least twice a day!  She loves to get up and dance and sing along with the adorable characters.  The songs are catchy and the words are easy to sing along with. I love the lessons that each story teaches.,5,Pajanimals Pajama Party,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,420,"['daughter', 'two', 'Pajanimals', 'books', 'received', 'kids', 'meals', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'so', 'when', 'put', 'Pajama', 'Party', 'DVD', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'characters', 'play', 'DVD', 'least', 'twice', 'day', 'get', 'up', 'dance', 'sing', 'along', 'adorable', 'characters', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'words', 'are', 'easy', 'sing', 'along', 'love', 'lessons', 'story', 'teaches']",Pajanimals: Pajanimals Party

She was as THRILLED as I thought she would be when it finally came! We watch the pajanimals as a special treat before bed-time some nights- and this movie did not disappoint us- it helps make our night time routine happier. My daughter loves to sing the familiar theme song- and was excited for ""new stories"" in this disk.  Her favorite is the second episode where all of the pajanimals play instruments and ""make music"" together. She wanted to watch it over and over! Music is her favorite thing in the world- so this earned big points in her eyes.  I appreciate the soothing songs and the great messages all of these stories provide as well. On a side not- I received a disk that was not playing correctly and that second episode kept freezing up my DVD player- NCircle was VERY quick to send a replacement- no questions asked. I can't say enough great things about this company! Great shows, and awesome customer service. Thank you!",5,Toddler Bedtime Fun,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1102,"['love', 'pajanimals-', 'have', 'been', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'new', 'movie', 'them-', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'knew', 'had', 'jump', '2', 'half', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'was', 'as', 'THRILLED', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'finally', 'came', 'watch', 'pajanimals', 'special', 'treat', 'bed-time', 'nights-', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'us-', 'make', 'night', 'time', 'routine', 'happier', 'daughter', 'sing', 'familiar', 'theme', 'song-', 'was', 'excited', 'new', 'stories', 'disk', 'favorite', 'second', 'episode', 'where', 'pajanimals', 'play', 'instruments', 'make', 'music', 'together', 'wanted', 'watch', 'Music', 'favorite', 'thing', 'world-', 'earned', 'big', 'points', 'eyes', 'appreciate', 'soothing', 'songs', 'great', 'messages', 'stories', 'provide', 'as', 'well', 'side', 'not-', 'received', 'disk', 'was', 'not', 'playing', 'correctly', 'second', 'episode', 'kept', 'freezing', 'up', 'DVD', 'player-', 'NCircle', 'was', 'VERY', 'quick', 'send', 'replacement-', 'questions', 'asked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'great', 'things', 'company', 'Great', 'shows', 'awesome', 'customer', 'service', 'Thank']",Pajanimals: Pajanimals Party
1641551,AOURF2C6EWZNS,B00C2PO17O,Jennifer,"[1, 1]","This month has been crazy, my son just turned 2 so I've been getting things ready for his party and let me tell you the Psjanimals: Pajama Party dvd has been a big help. As a NCirlce NSider I get to review a dvd each month. I was really excited to see that not only did NCircle have a new Pajamimals dvd but that it was a birthday one too. My son loves the Pajamimals, they are a great way to wind down at nap time and the end of the night. They are a big part of our nightly routine.In this dvd Cowbella, Apollo, Sweet Pea Sue and Squacky visit Birthday Land. There they learn that their birthdays are special not because of the things you get or what you have at your party but because your friends and family come to see you. That sometimes you may feel jealous if it isn't your birthday but that everyone has their own special day. They also learn that it isn't the gift you give but that it comes from the heart. All that and that's just three of the episodes on this super cute dvd. There are still two other episodes that deal with not giving up is something is hard to do, the other a dance party with plenty of fun. The Pajanimals: Pajama Party dvd is full of lessons made simple for young children and has a bunch of cute songs. My son loves watching it and I love the lessons each episode teaches.",5,A Great Birthday Surprise For Your Little One!,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,1308,"['month', 'been', 'crazy', 'son', 'just', 'turned', '2', 'so', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'things', 'ready', 'party', 'let', 'tell', 'Psjanimals', 'Pajama', 'Party', 'dvd', 'been', 'big', 'help', 'NCirlce', 'NSider', 'get', 'review', 'dvd', 'month', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'NCircle', 'have', 'new', 'Pajamimals', 'dvd', 'was', 'birthday', 'one', 'too', 'son', 'Pajamimals', 'are', 'great', 'way', 'wind', 'down', 'nap', 'time', 'end', 'night', 'are', 'big', 'part', 'nightly', 'routine.In', 'dvd', 'Cowbella', 'Apollo', 'Sweet', 'Pea', 'Sue', 'Squacky', 'visit', 'Birthday', 'Land', 'learn', 'birthdays', 'are', 'special', 'not', 'things', 'get', 'what', 'have', 'party', 'friends', 'family', 'come', 'see', 'sometimes', 'may', 'feel', 'jealous', ""n't"", 'birthday', 'everyone', 'own', 'special', 'day', 'also', 'learn', ""n't"", 'gift', 'give', 'heart', 'just', 'three', 'episodes', 'super', 'cute', 'dvd', 'are', 'still', 'two', 'other', 'episodes', 'deal', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'something', 'hard', 'do', 'other', 'dance', 'party', 'plenty', 'fun', 'Pajanimals', 'Pajama', 'Party', 'dvd', 'full', 'lessons', 'made', 'simple', 'young', 'children', 'bunch', 'cute', 'songs', 'son', 'watching', 'love', 'lessons', 'episode', 'teaches']",Pajanimals: Pajanimals Party

The kids got to watch the entire movie (twice) during our road trip and they LOVED it!  I have requests to keep it in the car DVD player for short trips too.Pajanimals have birthdays too!  In this video we got to celebrate with our favorite characters: Cowbella, Apollo, Sweet Pea Sue and Squacky.  We took a fantastic trip to Birthday Land (via flying bed of course) to learn why birthdays are so important!  We we taught about sharing and about patience, my two favorite things to teach my kids as they go hand in hand.  Also the importance of not being a jealous person and letting everyone enjoy their special day.There was lots of singing and dancing as always!While my two year old daughter is way more into pajanimals that my four year old boy it was still a great DVD to have for both of them and I would recommend it to anyone with kids two and up, both genders!Thanks again NCircle for the great titles for my kids and I to enjoy.",5,A perfect DVD for my kids,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,1052,"['received', 'copy', 'Pajanimals', 'Pajama', 'party', 'DVD', 'just', 'time', 'road', 'trip', 'go', 'camping', 'year', 'kids', 'got', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'twice', 'road', 'trip', 'LOVED', 'have', 'requests', 'keep', 'car', 'DVD', 'player', 'short', 'trips', 'too.Pajanimals', 'have', 'birthdays', 'too', 'video', 'got', 'celebrate', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Cowbella', 'Apollo', 'Sweet', 'Pea', 'Sue', 'Squacky', 'took', 'fantastic', 'trip', 'Birthday', 'Land', 'flying', 'bed', 'course', 'learn', 'why', 'birthdays', 'are', 'so', 'important', 'taught', 'sharing', 'patience', 'two', 'favorite', 'things', 'teach', 'kids', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'Also', 'importance', 'not', 'being', 'jealous', 'person', 'letting', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'special', 'day.There', 'was', 'lots', 'singing', 'dancing', 'always', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'way', 'more', 'pajanimals', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'DVD', 'have', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'kids', 'two', 'up', 'genders', 'Thanks', 'again', 'NCircle', 'great', 'titles', 'kids', 'enjoy']",Pajanimals: Pajanimals Party
