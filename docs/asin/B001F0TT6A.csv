Good reason for it - it has some quality parts, some unnecessary garbage.  If you are the type to see past the garbage, the rest is good!  My wife and I mostly 'put up with' the first half or so, then enjoyed most of the rest.  It does have enough profanity and 'sleazy' characters to offend.  Yes, life does have such people in real life, so it isn't unreal, but some, including myself, don't enjoy spending money for the 'joy' of watching such real life behavior.  The last part of the movie does bring together many loose ends created in the first part, showing some good choices - keep on despite trouble, look for real value rather than shallow temporary gain, etc.  My understanding is that Thomas Kinkade has a definite commitment to spiritual values - it is really not shown in this movie.  It shows moral values, but not clearly based in spiritual (Christian) ones.  The church in the movie has some solid role models along with characters that make church goin' people look silly.Over all, I do not plan to watch it again.

1187246,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B001F0TT6A,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 1]","""Thomas Kinkade's Christmas Cottage"" reminded me of what is best and worst of Kinkade's prodigious output of 'family-friendly' art; it is warm, optimistic, and glowing...but it is also unrealistic, contrived, and calculated to 'sell'. The film appears to have ambitions of becoming a modern ""It's a Wonderful Life"", but sorely lacks Frank Capra's gift for truly understanding people. In a world where everyone is basically 'nice', selfless acts are not miraculous, but expected, and this robs ""Christmas Cottage"" of any real emotional energy. What you wind up with is a marshmallow confection; sweet, but not particularly filling.Set in Placerville, California in the late 1970s, and based on Kinkade's experiences as an art student returning home for the holidays, the film introduces the young artist (well-played by Jared Padalecki), then attempts to ingratiate us with the sweet-natured 'characters' of the town, but most come across as caricatures, including Kinkade's overly supportive mother (Marcia Gay Harden), a saint who tries to solve everyone's problems as the family house crumbles into disrepair around her. Fortunately, Kinkade's neighbor and artist/mentor Glen Wesman (in real life, Glen Wessels...why his name was changed for the film is not explained), as portrayed by Peter O'Toole, is a welcome exception, blunt, introspective, and refreshingly candid.To earn money to keep his mother from losing their home, Kinkade accepts a commission to paint an outdoor Christmas mural celebrating the town, and the story unfolds as the mural emerges, as the local church rehearses an unintentionally funny Christmas pageant, two neighbors compete for the most outdoor decorations for the holidays, Kinkade's ne'er-do-well father (Richard Burgi) admits his own shortcomings, and Wesman drifts in and out of lucidity. The various subplots, while diverting, have little more depth than a TV-movie, and lack dramatic power.When nearly everything ends disasterously, a contrived ""Wonderful Life"" moment appears, meant to bring tears of joy, but which left me unmoved. The loose ends are tied up neatly, and Kinkade goes on to earn over $50 million selling 'feel-good' landscapes.The Special Features are a mixed bag, offering an in-film Commentary by Thomas Kinkade and director Michael Campus, Deleted Scenes (which are actually better than some left in!), a somewhat self-congratulatory feature on how the film came about, cast reflections on their own favorite Christmas, and a bizarre vignette of a biker 'extra' (portrayed by Kinkade, himself) getting himself fired from the film.Production-wise, the film isn't bad, but the script lacks a willingness to take risks, and the end result is no classic. If you love Kinkade's art (as millions do), you will probably enjoy the film; if, however, you are looking for true emotional satisfaction, stick with ""It's a Wonderful Life"".",2,A Bland Christmas Story in Pastel Hues...,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,2886,"['Thomas', 'Kinkade', 'Christmas', 'Cottage', 'reminded', 'what', 'best', 'worst', 'Kinkade', 'prodigious', 'output', ""'family-friendly"", 'art', 'warm', 'optimistic', 'glowing', 'also', 'unrealistic', 'contrived', 'calculated', ""'sell"", 'film', 'have', 'ambitions', 'becoming', 'modern', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'sorely', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'gift', 'truly', 'understanding', 'people', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'basically', ""'nice"", 'selfless', 'acts', 'are', 'not', 'miraculous', 'expected', 'robs', 'Christmas', 'Cottage', 'real', 'emotional', 'energy', 'What', 'wind', 'up', 'marshmallow', 'confection', 'sweet', 'not', 'particularly', 'filling.Set', 'Placerville', 'California', 'late', '1970s', 'based', 'Kinkade', 'experiences', 'art', 'student', 'returning', 'home', 'holidays', 'film', 'young', 'artist', 'well-played', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'then', 'ingratiate', 'sweet-natured', ""'characters"", 'town', 'most', 'come', 'caricatures', 'including', 'Kinkade', 'overly', 'supportive', 'mother', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'saint', 'who', 'solve', 'everyone', 'problems', 'family', 'house', 'disrepair', 'Fortunately', 'Kinkade', 'neighbor', 'artist/mentor', 'Glen', 'Wesman', 'real', 'life', 'Glen', 'Wessels', 'why', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'film', 'not', 'explained', 'portrayed', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'welcome', 'exception', 'blunt', 'introspective', 'refreshingly', 'candid.To', 'earn', 'money', 'keep', 'mother', 'losing', 'home', 'Kinkade', 'commission', 'paint', 'outdoor', 'Christmas', 'mural', 'celebrating', 'town', 'story', 'mural', 'emerges', 'local', 'church', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'two', 'neighbors', 'compete', 'most', 'outdoor', 'decorations', 'holidays', 'Kinkade', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'father', 'Richard', 'Burgi', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'Wesman', 'drifts', 'lucidity', 'various', 'subplots', 'diverting', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'TV-movie', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'power.When', 'nearly', 'everything', 'disasterously', 'contrived', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'moment', 'meant', 'bring', 'tears', 'joy', 'left', 'unmoved', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'neatly', 'Kinkade', 'earn', '50', 'million', 'selling', ""'feel-good"", 'landscapes.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'offering', 'in-film', 'Commentary', 'Thomas', 'Kinkade', 'director', 'Michael', 'Campus', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'better', 'left', 'somewhat', 'self-congratulatory', 'feature', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'about', 'cast', 'reflections', 'own', 'favorite', 'Christmas', 'bizarre', 'vignette', 'biker', 'portrayed', 'Kinkade', 'getting', 'fired', 'film.Production-wise', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'script', 'willingness', 'take', 'risks', 'end', 'result', 'classic', 'love', 'Kinkade', 'art', 'millions', 'do', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'however', 'are', 'looking', 'true', 'emotional', 'satisfaction', 'stick', 'Wonderful', 'Life']",N/A

Although she has been hit with many challenges she strives to take care of her two sons and to help her town in any way that she can.

HupFons ""Hup234""","[4, 6]","For those who purchase this Christmas movie, I HIGHLY recommend viewing the 20-minute or so Special Feature in which the actual Thomas Kinkade comments on the story, his relationship with Glen Wessells, and his art career. It's a fascinating feature and might be more wisely viewed before watching the movie than after the final credits fade.I especially enjoyed the last 30 minutes or so when the movie finally ""settled"" into what I consider the ""meatier"" part of the plot. At that point the quality of the movie shifted from a mediocre made-for-TV production -- although,in fact, it was not made-for-TV. During that final half hour, the quality of the story and the acting changed to a much richer depiction of the relationship of young, budding artist Kinkade and the source of his inspiration from the talented real-life painter Glen Wessels (played convincingly by Peter O'Toole), whose physical and mental faculties were failing significantly as Kinkade's were evolving. The last third of the film likewise portrayed much more convincingly that Kinkade's family and home town residents were witnessing the blossoming of a very talented young man's painting career.If the first hour had been as well done as the last 30 minutes, I'd have rated the movie 4 stars. Unfortunately the first hour was lackluster. At one point it seemed that the movie would focus on Thomas Kinkade. Then it seemed to focus on the possible foreclosure of the Kinkade cottage and the mother's and sons' struggles to keep the family's home from the clutches of the mortgage company. There were a couple of other meager attempts to give the story coherence, but those didn't pan out either.Jared Padalecki's performance was very good throughout the film, and O'Toole's went from very good to masterful toward the very end. The rest of the acting by the cast was mediocre, which is surprising considering Marcia Gay Harden had a major role.Due to some lame attempts at crude and suggestive humor, I'd recommend this for adults and older teens.",3,Good Film with Missed Potential,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,2021,"['who', 'purchase', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'viewing', '20-minute', 'so', 'Special', 'Feature', 'actual', 'Thomas', 'Kinkade', 'comments', 'story', 'relationship', 'Glen', 'Wessells', 'art', 'career', 'fascinating', 'feature', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'wisely', 'viewed', 'watching', 'movie', 'final', 'credits', 'fade.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'when', 'movie', 'finally', 'settled', 'what', 'consider', 'meatier', 'part', 'plot', 'point', 'quality', 'movie', 'shifted', 'mediocre', 'made-for-TV', 'production', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'made-for-TV', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'quality', 'story', 'acting', 'changed', 'much', 'richer', 'depiction', 'relationship', 'young', 'budding', 'artist', 'Kinkade', 'source', 'inspiration', 'talented', 'real-life', 'painter', 'Glen', 'Wessels', 'played', 'convincingly', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'physical', 'mental', 'faculties', 'were', 'failing', 'significantly', 'Kinkade', 'were', 'evolving', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'likewise', 'portrayed', 'much', 'more', 'convincingly', 'Kinkade', 'family', 'home', 'town', 'residents', 'were', 'witnessing', 'blossoming', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'man', 'painting', 'career.If', 'first', 'hour', 'had', 'been', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'last', '30', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'have', 'rated', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'Unfortunately', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'lackluster', 'one', 'point', 'seemed', 'movie', 'would', 'focus', 'Thomas', 'Kinkade', 'Then', 'seemed', 'focus', 'possible', 'foreclosure', 'Kinkade', 'cottage', 'mother', 'sons', 'struggles', 'keep', 'family', 'home', 'clutches', 'mortgage', 'company', 'were', 'couple', 'other', 'meager', 'attempts', 'give', 'story', 'coherence', 'did', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'either.Jared', 'Padalecki', 'performance', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', ""O'Toole"", 'went', 'very', 'good', 'masterful', 'very', 'end', 'rest', 'acting', 'cast', 'was', 'mediocre', 'surprising', 'considering', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'had', 'major', 'role.Due', 'lame', 'attempts', 'crude', 'suggestive', 'humor', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'adults', 'older', 'teens']",N/A

Some reviewers have been critical of the fact that it appears to be a ""warm fuzzy movie for the family"" and yet, it probably is not appropriate for children. There is some foul language (although not out of hand), and there are depictions of smoking, drinking, and cleavage. However, it's all done in the context of illustrating the characters and never feels ugly or obscene. It is not, by any stretch, an obnoxious film as some reviewers seem to have suggested,  and it an amazing and ""warm fuzzy film"" that has so many special moments I can't count them. One feels ""opened up"" after watching it. However, if one if very religious, skip this offering; there are better for you.However, if seen simply as a movie without critical regard for counting expletives (which I honestly didn't even notice--am I just deaf, or so ingrained in the culture that I don't even hear it?), this is a powerful, poignant and moving experience which won't leave dry eyes. The music, the profound wisdom about life, art and humanity, and the many many touching scenes put this film in the category of the greats. I think I could watch this film 10 times and still get something out of it. Peter O'Toole is magnificent, and he along with the lady costar who plays the mom have some amazing special moments together--and the music is breathtaking and perfect. There are some scenes with an artist painting, that are so moving and profound.Here are some of the amazing themes/issues covered:* Never Give up in the face of adversity* Loving those around you always returns manyfold to you* Life is about expression, love, connection, and honesty* Always give your finest, your very very best in everything you do, even if you don't think those around you ""deserve it.""* Each of us has something amazing, powerful, and special to give* Love triumphs over all* Family's should stick together* Friendship can be one of the most beautiful gifts/experiences life has to offer* Honor our elders--they have immense wisdom, beauty, and gifts to bring* You are never too old to accomplish anything your heart desiresAnother powerful aspect of this film is it is based on the real life of the painter Thomas Kinkade. So not only are you taken on an inspiring cinematic journey into the depths of the meaning of life, love, family, and friendship, but one is also learning about the amazing and profound life of the painter. It's a fantastic movie in every regard, a masterpiece, a triumph of the human spirit. It should be in your library.If you liked Steele Magnolias, you will love this film.

This film ended up being such a colossal bin of sap and schmaltz though, I felt compelled to write about it.The most noticeable critique I read prior was the foul language - there wasn't any (unless damn and hell are considered R ratings to some people now). The ""vulgarity"" and ""sensuality"" is so tame that it did not even deserve to be mentioned. This film was about a painter's early inspiration that coincides with the holiday season 1977 in Placerville, CA - so I am not sure what the fuss was about in warning the younger family about seeing this; they would be bored anyway.The acting was wholeheartedly forced and schmaltzy, and the sole redeeming performance of Mr. O'Toole cannot save the film, admittedly I love hearing his voice orate philosophy in any film. Marcia Gay Harden tries, but they asked her to do so many corny faces and lines you could tell she was in pain. Richard Moll acted like he just came off the Night Court set, as did Ed Asner's few minutes on screen from his last couple holiday films, as did Chris Elliot stumbling from the Groundhog Day set. I guess in that right they picked all holiday actors, but it still fell short of believable. It has the slight feel of a Lifetime movie, but with a higher budget; the cars and sets appeared to be correct and thorough for the era.The special features are for the Kincade fans, as there are four docus/set pieces that give plenty of insight about Kincade and the production process. The sound issues (written here) were non existent as both the 5.1 and 2.0 are included for you, so I would venture to guess people had bad system setups.

It was a segmented film in which you'd be looking at one part of the story, go to another, go back to the first part, jump over here. It was important for the story telling because it focused on the community of Placervillie itself. They showed a variety of side characters, giving glimpses into their heart ache and joy. Simple, it is an alright Christmas film.Now it is a cute film. It was created by a company that wants to create only family friendly (with messages) entertainment and I believe they did suceed in the fact that there is no vulgarity/sexuality/etc. like they intended.

Jared Padalecki plays the young Thomas Kinkade before he had found his niche in the painting world and when he was beset with family problems. His ability to emote and show a wide range of emotions is unsurpassed. And the late, great, internationally renowned Peter O'Toole plays his mentor with such attention to the slightest detail that it is almost painful.
