737584,A3V4ZFNKJ21P1M,B00008AOVO,Endless Kitchen,"[1, 1]","In Los Angeles, police detectives covertly hunt down lycanthropes who threaten the safety of the unsuspecting public who believe werewolves are simply mythical creatures. Detective Steve Turley (played by actor Ryan Alosio) witnesses the death of his partner as a particularly dangerous beast known as Darkwolf (a sort of uber-wolfman) threatens the lives of him, a waitress who is stalked as a mating partner for the beast which needs to continue its hybrid lineage and the entire city.This is one of the worst films I have ever seen and it is not even bad in a fun, laugh-at-it sort of way. Where do I even begin? How about the script? The plot is simple and silly. There is no tension or any memorable character(s). The characters say and do very stupid things, including the laugh-out-loud, nonsensical sentence fragment pouting of the lead actor, who acts like a police academy drop out. He also tells werewolf-related jokes, probably rejected jokes from Laffy Taffy wrappers, to which the other idiotic characters laugh at.Then there is the acting, which is uniformly atrocious. Ryan Alosio is a very poor acting. Scream queen and Hitchcock favorite Tippi Hedren embarrasses herself with a small role in this film. People talk about the nudity and risque scenes involving women at a photoshoot. Technically, it is in the film but it is not even very memorable raciness or erotica, whether in a trashy or artistic fashion. You will also see some depressingly poor special effects as the ""Darkwolf"" looks like the lint gorilla fromBatman & Robin (Two-Disc Special Edition)on all-fours. I understand this is a direct-to-video film, but I am less lenient on the poor special effects and props since the budget was over $2 million in 2003 USD. Speaking of props, there is a laughable scene where a SWAT officer is shown ""firing"" an assault rifle which is obviously a toy being shaken while cartoonish sound effects are being made.This is a film to be avoided. The tagline is ""Half Man. Half Beast. Pure Evil,"" but it should be ""Half Man. Half Beast. Pure Crap."" It is not worth even the MST3K treatment as it is not nearly as funny as the bad but unintentionally entertainingThe Room. I admit I had a big laugh at one of the transformation scenes where the Darkwolf looked like a character from a Tekken video game. For much better werewolf-related horror films, see the much superiorThe Company of Wolves,Trick 'r Treatand evenThe Wolfman (Unrated).",1,A very lousy film with some small bits of unintentional humor,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,2451,"['Los', 'Angeles', 'police', 'detectives', 'covertly', 'hunt', 'down', 'lycanthropes', 'who', 'threaten', 'safety', 'unsuspecting', 'public', 'who', 'believe', 'werewolves', 'are', 'simply', 'mythical', 'creatures', 'Detective', 'Steve', 'Turley', 'played', 'actor', 'Ryan', 'Alosio', 'death', 'partner', 'particularly', 'dangerous', 'beast', 'known', 'Darkwolf', 'sort', 'uber-wolfman', 'lives', 'waitress', 'who', 'stalked', 'mating', 'partner', 'beast', 'continue', 'hybrid', 'lineage', 'entire', 'city.This', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'even', 'bad', 'fun', 'laugh-at-it', 'sort', 'way', 'Where', 'do', 'even', 'begin', 'How', 'script', 'plot', 'simple', 'silly', 'tension', 'memorable', 'character', 's', 'characters', 'say', 'do', 'very', 'stupid', 'things', 'including', 'laugh-out-loud', 'nonsensical', 'sentence', 'fragment', 'pouting', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'police', 'academy', 'out', 'also', 'werewolf-related', 'jokes', 'probably', 'rejected', 'jokes', 'Laffy', 'Taffy', 'wrappers', 'other', 'idiotic', 'characters', 'at.Then', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'atrocious', 'Ryan', 'Alosio', 'very', 'poor', 'acting', 'Scream', 'queen', 'Hitchcock', 'favorite', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'small', 'role', 'film', 'People', 'talk', 'nudity', 'risque', 'scenes', 'involving', 'women', 'photoshoot', 'Technically', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'very', 'memorable', 'raciness', 'erotica', 'trashy', 'artistic', 'fashion', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'depressingly', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'Darkwolf', 'lint', 'gorilla', 'fromBatman', 'Robin', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'all-fours', 'understand', 'direct-to-video', 'film', 'am', 'less', 'lenient', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'props', 'budget', 'was', '2', 'million', '2003', 'USD', 'Speaking', 'props', 'laughable', 'scene', 'where', 'SWAT', 'officer', 'shown', 'firing', 'assault', 'rifle', 'obviously', 'toy', 'being', 'shaken', 'cartoonish', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'being', 'made.This', 'film', 'be', 'avoided', 'tagline', 'Half', 'Man', 'Half', 'Beast', 'Pure', 'Evil', 'should', 'be', 'Half', 'Man', 'Half', 'Beast', 'Pure', 'Crap', 'not', 'worth', 'even', 'MST3K', 'treatment', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'bad', 'unintentionally', 'entertainingThe', 'Room', 'admit', 'had', 'big', 'laugh', 'one', 'transformation', 'scenes', 'where', 'Darkwolf', 'looked', 'character', 'Tekken', 'video', 'game', 'much', 'better', 'werewolf-related', 'horror', 'films', 'see', 'much', 'superiorThe', 'Company', 'Wolves', 'Trick', 'r', 'Treatand', 'Wolfman', 'Unrated']",Dark Wolf

The movie did move smoothly from beginning to end and the story was decent, but the acting suffered and the special effects weren't very special at all.

737588,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B00008AOVO,Joshua Koppel,"[1, 2]","This movie has an interesting premise.  900 years ago, a Saxon mated with a werewolf and started a race of hybrids.  Our story involves some policemen who understand this and have been hunting the hybrids.  But in this movie they run into something different.  They meet the Darkwolf, a hybrid that is far faster and stronger than any other.The Darkwolf is a Dark Prince and he is looking for his special mate.  Should he find her and mate with her, their offspring will be unstoppable and mean the end of mankind.  Now it is up to one cop to protect the woman and stop the Darkwolf.Some parts of this movie are similar to Mark Rogers's Runestone while others look like they were taken from Surrender Cinema.  There are some great scenes and some artistic scenes, but the movie lacks solid continuity.  A good example would be Dog Soldiers.Also, the makers of the film should watch a few police shows.  The police in this movie were a real joke.  After one murder, some spectators just walk up and remove evidence in the middle of the investigation.  In fact the police completely ignore the witnesses and spectators.  The ending is also typical of action movies.  I am sure the IG office and Internal Affairs will be tired up with paperwork for years based on the ending, but the lead cop just walks away as if nothing really happened (watch the movie and you will see what I mean).As many reviewers have pointed out, yes, there is a lot of nudity in this film.

Darkwolf has a hallarious plot line that is made all the funnier by the fact this movie really attempts to take itself seriously in a tongue in cheek sort of way.  Part sexpot slasher film, part gore flick part adventurous sex party flesh romp, part police mystery, part gun toting I'm going to get my prey or die trying hunt fest, Darkwolf tired to be all things to all people.Most A movies with such hopes usually fall flat but not DarkWolf as it has just enough of each element to be a blood fest one minute, a sex feast the next minute, a gun flick the next minute and a special effects wonder after that.  The movie is all youth with a generous smattering of tight toned hard bodies in most of the staring roles.DarkWolf rated R is a movie sexually raunchy as it can get and still be just an R rating so it is not one recommended for the kids & kinder after mom's PTA social.  This movie is raw fun.  Look at the movie and pick out its flaws there are ton's of them but they just add to the fun of the movie.  I loved this movie so much more than the sophisticated mainstream werewolf fare like that big named snore-fest ""An American Werewolf in London!""  You want a dead boring study on Werewolves as high art in movies buy an American Werewolf in London and buy tooth picks to prop your eyes open you'll need them.
