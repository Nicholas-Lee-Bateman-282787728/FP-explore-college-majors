Andre edits all his DVDs and CDs personally...  so you are getting the official stuff.  My only gripe: videos of this same concert on YouTube are in HD.  This DVD is not.

1072839,A1CDTAI0BWQPS,B000PSP9AI,B. Wong,"[3, 5]","Schonbrunn is about the best Andre Rieu dvd I had seen. Others had made the same comments so I will not review what is common. What I like to comment on is the DD5.1. The left front channel is almost non existent. The volume between channels is so unbalanced that viewing the concert on 5.1 is just not enjoyable. The DD2.0 audio track is OK and that saved the dvd for me. I watched the entire concert using the 2.0 track and I enjoyed most of the program. I did skipped the 2 segments performed by the guy with the dog as commented by another reviewer.I could have tried compensating the unbalance using the receiver controls, but I do not want to do that just for 1 dvd. May be the next time I feel like playing the dvd again, I will give it a try to find out if the balanced 5.1 would make Schonbrunn that much more enjoyable.Am I the only person with the 5.1 sound track problem? I surely would like to hear from others.The performance, video quality, and program content rated 4.9 stars (the -.1 is because of the dog segments). The 3 star overall is because of the 5.1 unbalance.",3,"Great performance, Great PQ, Bad DD5.1",1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,1085,"['Schonbrunn', 'best', 'Andre', 'Rieu', 'dvd', 'had', 'seen', 'Others', 'had', 'made', 'same', 'comments', 'will', 'not', 'review', 'what', 'common', 'What', 'like', 'comment', 'DD5.1', 'left', 'front', 'channel', 'almost', 'non', 'existent', 'volume', 'channels', 'so', 'unbalanced', 'viewing', 'concert', '5.1', 'just', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'DD2.0', 'audio', 'track', 'OK', 'saved', 'dvd', 'watched', 'entire', 'concert', 'using', '2.0', 'track', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'program', 'did', 'skipped', '2', 'segments', 'performed', 'guy', 'dog', 'commented', 'reviewer.I', 'could', 'have', 'tried', 'compensating', 'unbalance', 'using', 'receiver', 'controls', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'just', '1', 'dvd', 'May', 'be', 'next', 'time', 'feel', 'playing', 'dvd', 'again', 'will', 'give', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'balanced', '5.1', 'would', 'make', 'Schonbrunn', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable.Am', 'only', 'person', '5.1', 'sound', 'track', 'problem', 'surely', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'others.The', 'performance', 'video', 'quality', 'program', 'content', 'rated', '4.9', 'stars', '-.1', 'dog', 'segments', '3', 'star', 'overall', '5.1', 'unbalance']","Andre Rieu - At Schonbrunn, Vienna and the Johann Strauss Orchestra"

This one too was a great show.. yes there were some of the productions that didn't appeal to me but overall this was a great dvd and one I am sure that people will play again and again..
