I loved superheroes and mythology as a child. When I saw it was on DVD at a such a low price I jumped at the chance to add to my collection. The show is still great; but for different reasons now. These days I enjoy it with my wife and kid for the pure nostalgia and cheesiness it offers. We love the disco background music. Unlike Superman and Wonder Woman's secret identities whose professions may lend themselves to some danger along the way, Isis' alter ego is a science teacher--and yet she still somehow gets involved in unlikely adventures--much to our amusement. We always laugh when everybody in town seems to treat a heroine able to fly and lift cars like no big deal. Seriously, they treat Isis like ""Oh hi, Isis, didn't see you there"" and it is just hilarious. Superhero TV was different and simpler then. However, looking at it through a different lens, it is still enjoyable now.As for the DVD itself, it is just a collection of episodes from the series. No special features or even subtitles. This was disappointing but considering the price, it was to be expected.",4,Nostalgia in spades...,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,1188,"['remember', 'watching', 'Secrets', 'Isis', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'younger', 'was', 'great', 'then', 'loved', 'superheroes', 'mythology', 'child', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'DVD', 'such', 'low', 'price', 'jumped', 'chance', 'add', 'collection', 'show', 'still', 'great', 'different', 'reasons', 'now', 'days', 'enjoy', 'wife', 'kid', 'pure', 'nostalgia', 'cheesiness', 'love', 'disco', 'background', 'music', 'Superman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'secret', 'identities', 'professions', 'may', 'lend', 'danger', 'way', 'Isis', 'alter', 'ego', 'science', 'teacher', 'yet', 'still', 'somehow', 'involved', 'unlikely', 'adventures', 'much', 'amusement', 'always', 'laugh', 'when', 'everybody', 'town', 'treat', 'heroine', 'able', 'fly', 'lift', 'cars', 'big', 'deal', 'Seriously', 'treat', 'Isis', 'Oh', 'hi', 'Isis', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'there', 'just', 'hilarious', 'Superhero', 'TV', 'was', 'different', 'simpler', 'then', 'However', 'looking', 'different', 'lens', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'now.As', 'DVD', 'just', 'collection', 'episodes', 'series', 'special', 'features', 'even', 'subtitles', 'was', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'price', 'was', 'be', 'expected']",The Secrets of Isis

We are allowed to recapture Saturday morning children's television from the 1970's once again.  Live-Action children's series were produced for another generation of children who never even heard of Ipods, cell phones, laptops or video games.  While it may not have been a simpler time, we were still literate enough to enjoy television at its finest.  Joanna Cameron's Isis, like Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman, was one hot lady who will live forever in the pre-pubescent mind of the younger adolescent.
