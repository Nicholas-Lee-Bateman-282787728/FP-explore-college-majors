1104230,ACOHUPNWQ3TQ0,B000VUFJ14,Bob C.,"[1, 1]","I can attest to how these small (usually) boxes that make strange sounds can be very alluring and almost addicting.  So it's no surprise that someone decided to make a DVD of these otherworldly devices.This DVD is not a chronological history of fuzz tones.  Instead it is a string of interviews with musicians, fuzz designers and other denizens of the music business.  The director demonstrates some of the pedals, sometimes in an odd outfit of shorts and dress shoes, though the clips do not always correspond to the pedals being discussed.But don't let any of that deter you from checking this thing out.  The only thing more fun than this DVD is plugging in and playing one of these things. THe Fuzz tone sound is one of the first and most fun of the effects pedals.  Garage bands in the 60's wore out thousands of Gibson Maestro, Univox and Mosrite fuzzes.  And, Hendrix forever popularized the Fuzz Face.  Many of the current fuzzes are variations of these originals, though some attempt to go way beyond these classic sounds.One of the interviewees, Jack Waterson, owner of Future Music, L.A., puts in all into perspective when he says that the design of these boxes is not high end engineering but alchemy and that musicians should rely on practice and discipline to achieve their unique sound.  But, there is no denying that the disturbing sound of  fuzz tones are crazy fun and have been undermining the sound of popular music for the past 40 plus years.",4,Fun and Disturbing Sounds,1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,1463,"['can', 'attest', 'how', 'small', 'usually', 'boxes', 'make', 'strange', 'sounds', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'alluring', 'almost', 'addicting', 'surprise', 'someone', 'decided', 'make', 'DVD', 'otherworldly', 'devices.This', 'DVD', 'not', 'chronological', 'history', 'fuzz', 'tones', 'Instead', 'string', 'interviews', 'musicians', 'fuzz', 'designers', 'other', 'denizens', 'music', 'business', 'director', 'pedals', 'sometimes', 'odd', 'outfit', 'shorts', 'dress', 'shoes', 'clips', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'correspond', 'pedals', 'being', 'discussed.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'checking', 'thing', 'out', 'only', 'thing', 'more', 'fun', 'DVD', 'plugging', 'playing', 'one', 'things', 'THe', 'Fuzz', 'tone', 'sound', 'one', 'first', 'most', 'fun', 'effects', 'pedals', 'Garage', 'bands', '60', 'wore', 'thousands', 'Gibson', 'Maestro', 'Univox', 'Mosrite', 'fuzzes', 'Hendrix', 'forever', 'popularized', 'Fuzz', 'Face', 'Many', 'current', 'fuzzes', 'are', 'variations', 'originals', 'attempt', 'go', 'way', 'classic', 'sounds.One', 'interviewees', 'Jack', 'Waterson', 'owner', 'Future', 'Music', 'L.A.', 'perspective', 'when', 'design', 'boxes', 'not', 'high', 'end', 'engineering', 'alchemy', 'musicians', 'should', 'rely', 'practice', 'discipline', 'achieve', 'unique', 'sound', 'denying', 'disturbing', 'sound', 'fuzz', 'tones', 'are', 'crazy', 'fun', 'have', 'been', 'undermining', 'sound', 'popular', 'music', 'past', '40', 'years']",N/A
1104231,AZ4JHTB28WC39,B000VUFJ14,Criterion Collector,"[0, 0]","I agree with all the other reviewers who say that it is &#34;passable&#34; and &#34;could have been much better&#34;.  I am somewhat of a gear-head, but I still found this a frustrating talk-fest, mostly by minor players or unknowns.  The director seems to have had trouble getting very many well-known figures to talk to him, so the film is dominated by lesser-knowns who seem to be grateful for the attention.I expected that there would be more detail on the legendary early boxes.  There is some coverage (e.g., Big Muff), but much of the movie is devoted to extensive blather about issues that could have been covered in less detail (e.g., products that rip off older designs; methods of obfuscating the circuits so they can't be copied; the unreliability of some small-shop products, etc.).There is almost no comparison of the tonal qualities of the different boxes.  There are short clips showing demos of notable boxes two at a time, in which only one of the two is hooked up.  In most cases this is followed by absolutely no discussion of either box.  And while there appears to be a Dallas Arbiter Rangemaster in front of Billy Gibbons in his interview, I'm not sure that this legendary box is mentioned anywhere in the movie (if it is, it is brief).J Mascis is mentioned on the cover, but he is barely in it.  There are two short clips of him standing in front of his collection of Big Muffs.  It is well known that he has an extensive collection of pedals but apparently the director was not able to even get footage of them.I will say that there are decent tidbits throughout.  I was interested to see the major boutique designers that they were able to talk to (e.g., Analog Man, Robert Keeley, the guy from Way Huge).  The tour of the Electro Harmonix factory was also interesting.  If you are interested in this stuff it is worth giving it a shot, as long as your expectations are not too high.(BTW, I believe that the Jack Waterson who appears extensively was the bass player for the 80's Paisley Underground band Green On Red, but for some reason he is not identified as such.)",3,Was hoping for better but it is OK,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,2094,"['agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'say', '34', 'passable', '34', '34', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', '34', 'am', 'somewhat', 'gear-head', 'still', 'found', 'frustrating', 'talk-fest', 'mostly', 'minor', 'players', 'unknowns', 'director', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'very', 'many', 'well-known', 'figures', 'talk', 'film', 'dominated', 'lesser-knowns', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'grateful', 'attention.I', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'detail', 'legendary', 'early', 'boxes', 'coverage', 'e.g.', 'Big', 'Muff', 'much', 'movie', 'devoted', 'extensive', 'blather', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'less', 'detail', 'e.g.', 'products', 'rip', 'older', 'designs', 'methods', 'obfuscating', 'circuits', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'copied', 'unreliability', 'small-shop', 'products', 'etc', 'almost', 'comparison', 'tonal', 'qualities', 'different', 'boxes', 'are', 'short', 'clips', 'showing', 'demos', 'notable', 'boxes', 'two', 'time', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'hooked', 'up', 'most', 'cases', 'followed', 'absolutely', 'discussion', 'box', 'there', 'be', 'Dallas', 'Arbiter', 'Rangemaster', 'front', 'Billy', 'Gibbons', 'interview', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'legendary', 'box', 'mentioned', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'brief', '.J', 'Mascis', 'mentioned', 'cover', 'barely', 'are', 'two', 'short', 'clips', 'standing', 'front', 'collection', 'Big', 'Muffs', 'well', 'known', 'extensive', 'collection', 'pedals', 'apparently', 'director', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'even', 'get', 'footage', 'them.I', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'decent', 'tidbits', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'major', 'boutique', 'designers', 'were', 'able', 'talk', 'e.g.', 'Analog', 'Man', 'Robert', 'Keeley', 'guy', 'Way', 'Huge', 'tour', 'Electro', 'Harmonix', 'factory', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'are', 'interested', 'stuff', 'worth', 'giving', 'shot', 'as', 'long', 'expectations', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'high', 'BTW', 'believe', 'Jack', 'Waterson', 'who', 'extensively', 'was', 'bass', 'player', '80', 'Paisley', 'Underground', 'band', 'Green', 'Red', 'reason', 'not', 'identified', 'such']",N/A

There are a lot of 'kinda sorta' related interviews patched together with abrupt and frequent topic changes.  Lots of interesting people do make an appearance (a little bit of Billy Gibbons WHO CURIOUSLY DOES NOT PLAY ANY GUITAR ON THE VIDEO, Electro Harmonix, Analogman, etc.).  There isn't much demo'ing of the pedals, its mainly snippets of disjointed conversations among pedal makers and random musicians.  It doesn't focus on any one topic (history, technology, evoloution of fuzz pedals), it is literally random interviews patched together.  This was interesting for me ONLY because I am so hardcore about guitar pedals, but this movie could have been made SO much better.  I would have loved to have had an explanation of the circuit, the story of the evolution of the fuzz/overdrive sound (with old clips of ppl like Hendrix or Clapton playing them), and more extensive demo'ing of pedals.

With a rather narrow focus, a rather free flowing presentation style, and a lack of technical information, the audience would seem to be rather limited, even among those who play guitar, as the information often seems more anecdotal than factual.In the early days of effects, back in the late 1960's, there appear to have been some interesting ""characters"", involved in the development and manufacture of these kinds of devices.  One example is a guy from Electro Hamonics, who takes you on a tour of the plant, where he introduces a series of female workers, tells you what job they do, and what foreign country they are from.  Not many guitarists are interviewed, but among the most well-known are Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, and Peter Frampton.As someone who plays guitar, I didn't learn any new techniques or tips from this documentary.  Technical information is minimal, and there are few historical facts, but if you are interested in hearing the thoughts of some of the pioneers in this particular field, then this may be of some interest.
