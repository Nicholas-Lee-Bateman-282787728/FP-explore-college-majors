I couldn't believe that something this beautiful could actually be released in the current Brittney Spears/ Paris Hilton world....but YES!!!This is a spectacularly filmed and played concert...conducted by the composer himself....oh and the pacing is sublime!  Sooo much to love here and enjoy over and over...fans of the spaghetti Westerns won't be dissapointed but even themes from foreign films unfamiliar  are immediately enjoyable.it is a CRIME that this man has never won an OSCAR ...his soundtrack compositions are unmatched in quality AND quantity...oh well...I guess the fact he doesn't live and work in Southern California has its price.  I can't believe he didn't win for Cinema Paradiso, but heck....pick any of them...they are too beautiful to only win Oscars...they will stick in your head and hearts forever!Enjoy!",5,music from heaven!  too good to be true!,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,911,"['was', 'browsing', 'shelves', 'Tower', 'evening', 'jumped', 'off', 'shelf', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'something', 'beautiful', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'released', 'current', 'Brittney', 'Spears/', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'world', '.but', 'YES', 'spectacularly', 'filmed', 'played', 'concert', 'conducted', 'composer', '.oh', 'pacing', 'sublime', 'Sooo', 'much', 'love', 'here', 'enjoy', 'fans', 'spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed', 'even', 'themes', 'foreign', 'films', 'unfamiliar', 'are', 'immediately', 'enjoyable.it', 'CRIME', 'man', 'never', 'won', 'OSCAR', 'soundtrack', 'compositions', 'are', 'unmatched', 'quality', 'AND', 'quantity', 'oh', 'well', 'guess', 'fact', ""n't"", 'live', 'work', 'Southern', 'California', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'heck', 'are', 'too', 'beautiful', 'only', 'win', 'Oscars', 'will', 'stick', 'head', 'hearts', 'forever', 'Enjoy']",N/A

That's why I waited a long timebefore purchasing ""Morricone conducts Morricone"" thinking I'd buyat least something equal to that. No way....!This is absolutely marvellous and here are the reasons why:- it's an indoor concert which makes the sound quality unbelievable- there are more movie themes being played than usual and we can listento such beauties as ""Sicilian Clan, Love Circle, H2S and Maddalena""- the solo performances on Cockeye Song and Making Love make you trans-port to the utmost ""boundaries"" of what music can be like...It is 100 minutes of pure pleasure without any pause just straightone Morricone beauty after another.

977342,A28DVCRPW16NUR,B000EQHRW4,"Young Seok Park ""musicarama""","[14, 15]","Yes, the music in this 2004 live concert by Ennio Morricone must be from heaven. All the music was so beautiful and mesmerizing with such harmony and detail that I couldn't stop watching. The concert was very well prepared and performed by Munchen Radio Orchestra, Bavarian Radio Choir, and the outstanding soloists including the soprano, panflutist, violist, and pianist, under the direction of Morricone himself. I got this DVD yesterday and already watched it three times. Before seeing the concert, I thought only Morricone music I knew was that of ""Cinema Paradiso"" and ""The Mission."" But, I was wrong! I noticed that most pieces sounded so familiar and were ones I had actually liked. I really enjoyed the theme from ""Once upon a time in America,"" in which I was very impressed by the panflutist.(I'd never seen anyone play a panflute before) Of course, the famous soundtracks from ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" as well as ""The Mission"" (including ""Gabriel's Oboe"") were exceptional. It was definitely enjoyable to watch the soprano, who sang, in a ""sket"" style, themes from ""Once upon a time in the West"" and other films. It was also a true pleasure to hear the distinctive theme from ""Sicilian Clan,"" in which I remember the French actor Alan Delon was. Only one thing regrettable was that this DVD included only one theme from the famous film ""Cinema Paradiso."" It seems, unfortunately, there was some editing for that part for some reason. Anyway, I have to say that Morricone is a true genius. In the liner notes of the DVD, he was desribed as ""Picasso of film music"" but my version would be ""He is Mozart of film music."" I hope Morricone will do more for film music in the future.Techinically this DVD is at top notch. Vision is excellent with 16x9 enhanced and sound is clear and rich with DD5.1, dts5.1, and PCM. I strongly recommend you to have a copy of this DVD right away and let your spirit soar.",5,Oh my...
