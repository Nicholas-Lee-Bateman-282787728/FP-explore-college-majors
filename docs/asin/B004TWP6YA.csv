1427932,A2R5VKE4YO966D,B004TWP6YA,Charles Curtis,"[0, 0]","This is the story of a Brazilian family spending their summer at their beach house, told mostly from the perspective of the family's 16 year old daughter, Filipa.  The father is a well know writer in Brazil, writing in Portuguese but but actually of French extraction (he's played by the excellent and very multilingual Vincent Cassell - real life spouse of Monica Belluci, who is unfortunately not in this film - he can also been seen in the Mesrine and Shrek series, Oceans 12 & 13, Elizabeth, Haine, Black Swan, etc.) and some of the dialogue btwn the wife and husband switches from Portuguese to French, when they want not to be understood by the kids..Which happens to be quite often, because their relationship is in meltdown, and Filipa is all too perceptive.. Far too perceptive, in fact, because she notices far more than she is meant to, and begins to misinterpret the situation, as she becomes privy to too many secrets.Like Filipa, we are invited to judge her parents, to take emotional sides.  Poor Filipa is just trying to grow up, and the adults in her life are not helping.  Not, at least, when it comes to modeling functional adult romantic relationships.That's the drifting that the title refers to.  Adrift in a world of overwrought and aching adolescence without sufficient moral or emotional referents.  I was just thinking it reminds me somewhat of the excellent 1997 American film Icestorm, only being set in sunny Brazil, rather than wintery suburban Connecticut..",5,I Really Enjoyed This.,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1488,"['story', 'Brazilian', 'family', 'spending', 'summer', 'beach', 'house', 'told', 'mostly', 'perspective', 'family', '16', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Filipa', 'father', 'well', 'know', 'writer', 'Brazil', 'writing', 'Portuguese', 'actually', 'French', 'extraction', 'played', 'excellent', 'very', 'multilingual', 'Vincent', 'Cassell', 'real', 'life', 'spouse', 'Monica', 'Belluci', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'been', 'seen', 'Mesrine', 'Shrek', 'series', 'Oceans', '12', '13', 'Elizabeth', 'Haine', 'Black', 'Swan', 'etc', 'dialogue', 'wife', 'husband', 'switches', 'Portuguese', 'French', 'when', 'want', 'not', 'be', 'understood', 'kids..Which', 'be', 'quite', 'often', 'relationship', 'meltdown', 'Filipa', 'too', 'perceptive..', 'Far', 'too', 'perceptive', 'fact', 'far', 'more', 'meant', 'misinterpret', 'situation', 'privy', 'too', 'many', 'secrets.Like', 'Filipa', 'are', 'invited', 'judge', 'parents', 'take', 'emotional', 'sides', 'Poor', 'Filipa', 'just', 'trying', 'grow', 'up', 'adults', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'helping', 'Not', 'least', 'when', 'modeling', 'functional', 'adult', 'romantic', 'relationships.That', 'drifting', 'title', 'refers', 'Adrift', 'world', 'overwrought', 'aching', 'adolescence', 'sufficient', 'moral', 'emotional', 'referents', 'was', 'just', 'thinking', 'somewhat', 'excellent', '1997', 'American', 'film', 'Icestorm', 'only', 'being', 'set', 'sunny', 'Brazil', 'rather', 'wintery', 'suburban', 'Connecticut..']",Adrift (2009)
1427933,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004TWP6YA,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 3]","Coming of age movies can be tough to make. Walking a fine line between the emotions involved, without swaying too much between being too distanced and being overwrought, is a daunting task. This movie handles it quite well.Here's the scoop. Filipa, her brother and sister, as well as the folks are on summer vacation at their place on the Brazilian coast. At 14 years old, she's starting to blossom and is feeling much of the inherent confusion that goes along with raging hormones. Add to it that she finds out her dad (a writer experiencing writer's block) is having an affair, and mom never seems to be without a drink in her hand, and she feels like there is no solid ground on which to get her footing.This is a very good film. The viewer gets a strong feeling for this family's dynamic. How they are as individuals and how they are together. Mom is definitely troubled. She's drinking too much. She seems to be the practical one in the family, trying to get hubby to focus and get some cash flow going. Hubby just wants to write. He can't seem to deal with the day-to-day. But Filipa is at the center. She has a natural beauty and seems to be a caring person. She does some cruel things but those seem to stem from her confusion. As the situation between mom and dad heats up she starts to unravel. She's more her father's girl so she figures dad needs to make things right. There is a twist that happens with mom and dad near the end which turns that around. It sheds new light on things but the outcome is the same. Filipa's family will be broken.This has a good look to it. Great attention is paid to a beautiful landscape. The water motif is used to great effect. I also liked the music a lot. Many of the scored sections reminded me of Phillip Glass. Laura Neiva is good as Filipa. Vince Cassell is always good. All the others do a fine job in their roles. At 107 minutes I thought it ran a bit long, but that's a minor quibble given the overall quality. If you like the 'tortured family' type dramas, this is one of the better ones.",4,At the Crossroads,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,2044,"['Coming', 'age', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'make', 'Walking', 'fine', 'line', 'emotions', 'involved', 'swaying', 'too', 'much', 'being', 'too', 'distanced', 'being', 'overwrought', 'daunting', 'task', 'movie', 'quite', 'scoop', 'Filipa', 'brother', 'sister', 'as', 'well', 'folks', 'are', 'summer', 'vacation', 'place', 'Brazilian', 'coast', '14', 'years', 'old', 'starting', 'blossom', 'feeling', 'much', 'inherent', 'confusion', 'along', 'raging', 'hormones', 'Add', 'out', 'dad', 'writer', 'experiencing', 'writer', 'block', 'having', 'affair', 'mom', 'never', 'be', 'drink', 'hand', 'solid', 'ground', 'get', 'footing.This', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'viewer', 'strong', 'feeling', 'family', 'dynamic', 'How', 'are', 'individuals', 'how', 'are', 'together', 'Mom', 'definitely', 'troubled', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'practical', 'one', 'family', 'trying', 'get', 'hubby', 'focus', 'get', 'cash', 'flow', 'going', 'Hubby', 'just', 'write', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'deal', 'day-to-day', 'Filipa', 'center', 'natural', 'beauty', 'be', 'caring', 'person', 'cruel', 'things', 'seem', 'stem', 'confusion', 'situation', 'mom', 'dad', 'up', 'unravel', 'more', 'father', 'girl', 'dad', 'needs', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'twist', 'mom', 'dad', 'end', 'new', 'light', 'things', 'outcome', 'same', 'Filipa', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'broken.This', 'good', 'look', 'Great', 'attention', 'paid', 'beautiful', 'landscape', 'water', 'motif', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'also', 'liked', 'music', 'lot', 'Many', 'scored', 'sections', 'reminded', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'Laura', 'Neiva', 'good', 'Filipa', 'Vince', 'Cassell', 'always', 'good', 'others', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'roles', '107', 'minutes', 'thought', 'ran', 'bit', 'long', 'minor', 'quibble', 'given', 'overall', 'quality', 'like', ""'tortured"", 'family', 'type', 'dramas', 'one', 'better', 'ones']",Adrift (2009)

1427935,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004TWP6YA,Grady Harp,"[35, 42]","ADRIFT (&Agrave; Deriva) is a reflection of the eponymous certain summer every young teenager experiences.  By setting this story of discovery - of parental flaws and infidelities as well as the coming into flower sexually - in the 1980s, before cellphones and emotional isolation crept into our lives, and by placing it in the idyllic setting of the exotic Brazilian seaside, writer/director Heitor Dhalia avoids the gimmicks and interruptions upon which we all new rely and instead allows the story to unfold as a personal journey as seen form the eyes of a fourteen-year old youth.  It is a quite miracle of a film.Famous author Matthias (Vincent Cassel) has brought his family from So Paulo for a summer vacation: his beautiful, alcoholic, frustrated wife Clarice (D&eacute;bora Bloch), his young son Antnio (Max Huzar), his middle daughter Fernanda (Izadora Armelin), and his fourteen-year-old daughter Filipa (Laura Neiva).  The interaction with Matthias and his children is warm and sincere but there seems to be a stress between Matthias and Clarice. The children spend their days at the beach where Filipa begins to recognize the onset of her coming of age when young Artur (Daniel Passi) comes on to her. Filipa is anxious about the onset of femininity and wonders about the perceived friction between her parents.  She discovers evidence of her father's affair with an American tourist ngela (Camilla Belle) living at the beach and spies on the couple in their clandestine meetings. In response she pays more attention to Artur and to a handsome bartender (Cau Reymond) whom she has discovered having an assignation with ngela. When Matthias and Clarice finally confront their children about the real reason for the summer vacation from So Paulo and their intention to separate, Filipa realizes that her parents' marriage is  a mutual sham and finds her own way of escaping the realities she has discovered: she is left adrift on the sea of Life and must find her own choices of how to face her femininity, her concepts of relationships, and fragility of fidelity.In Heitor Dhalia sure hands this film is a tender pleasure to watch: making the focus of the story center on  the relationship between Mathias and his daughter Filipa he allows us to understand the various aspects of the fragmenting family. None of this could happen were it not for the meticulously perfect performances by the entire cast - with special emphasis on Vincent Cassel and Laura Neiva and D&eacute;bora Bloch.  The cinematography by Ricardo Della Rosa sensitively uses the water  supporting bodies as a visual metaphor, from above and from below the surface just as the film reveals the obvious and occult aspects of a failing marriage. The film is in Portuguese with English subtitles.
