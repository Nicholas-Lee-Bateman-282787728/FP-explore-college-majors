1617006,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00AW0KHTM,A. Burchfield,"[0, 1]","I've always thought the Twilight books were better than the movies and that some movies resembled their respective &#34;books&#34; more than others- I liked them all anyway even though there was often a &#34;why did they change/do that!?&#34; factor to the adaptations. Breaking Dawn part 2 was, in my opinion, much closer to Stephenie Meyer's version than part 1 was. The big battle sequence at the end, while visually impressive, minimized Bella's &#34;power&#34; and gave Alice a greater role. It looked good but i liked the book better. Not bad for an adaptation- considering what Hollywood usually does to a book.Some of the reviewers- I think must not have read any of the books. The whole Twilight series of movies seems to have relied on the fans knowing what's going on- which leaves the casual viewer completely lost at times because they haven't read the relevant book. I, and so many others, have read the books- we can recognize a scene even if it isn't in book form- we understand the bits left unexplained to the uninitiated. Breaking Dawn part 2 will go better if you've read at least the second part of the book.I liked the closing credits better than the opening credits, nice touch- sort of a last salute to so many past cast members (including both Victorias).Very nice set of extras with this one, as good as any in the series? Fascinating how they achieved everything although I did think the process of adapting Mackenzie Foy's face to the other girls bodies didn't work very well (the computer generated baby(ies?) especially awkward). Well worth watching this stuff. One extra not listed on the packaging but present is the Green Day video for &#34;The Forgotten&#34;, I'd seen it listed either on the UK or Australian editions and wondered why we weren't getting it- maybe it's present on all editions, listed or not.

1617007,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B00AW0KHTM,Ace Reader,"[9, 15]","""Breaking Dawn"" by author Stephenie Myer's is my favorite book in the ""Twilight"" book series. I had very high exceptions for this final film and conclusion to this paranormal romance series. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part-2 the film, did not disappoint. It is very entertaining and enjoyable, delivering everything a true ""TWIHARD"" would want. The creators of Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2"" did a wonderful job applying this story-line to a screenplay that could be argued to be the best film in this series. They got this one right in every way that matters. It's really close to the book and a true fan film. I enjoyed it because it satisfies the anticipation I felt in wanting to see Bella finally become a vampire. In this film her greatest wish (becoming a vampire) is finally realized and she's good at it. Like her character in this film says, ""I was born to be a vampire."" Also, just as importantly is what happens to Edward after this highly feared and powerful change brings Bella fully into his world for the very first time. Edward has his dream come true as well. He and Bella for the first time are equals. They are in love and married. They together have their greatly loved miracle child, Renesmee. Their vampire lives seem perfect. Edward is finally at peace. Then the wicked Volturi come attempting to ruin their recently won happiness.All the actors and actresses did fantastic jobs acting their parts. I really enjoyed all the new vampire characters in this film. It added a lot of fun and many light hearted laughs. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart did a great job channeling Edward and Bella.Taylor Lautner was amazing as Jacob. That young man and all his muscles are going to go far in Hollywood. He's only just begun! Lee Pace was wonderful as the rogue vampire Garrett. Every time Mr. Pace was on screen the film became a better movie. And, I will always love Bella's Dad Charlie. Actor Billy Burke (see;Pilot) is wonderful, especially in the scene when Jacob takes off his shirt to show him that he's a werewolf-shapeshifter. What a funny ""classic"" scene! The pretty young girl who played Bella and Edward daughter (Mackenzie Foy) was a remarkable good look-a-like for Kristen Stewart and a good little actress as well.The best part of this film was at the end! The long anticipated Volturi vs. Carlisle's vampire/werewolf clan (EPIC) fight-scene with the great twist was exhilarating and entertaining to watch. Editor Virginia Katz did fabulous work with this film, especially this end fight scene. Screenplay writer Melissa Rosenberg and Director Bill Condon handled this material perfectly doing a great job as well.I know and everyone should know and understand that it's impossible to fit an entire story-line from a novel into two or even three hours of movie viewing time. Much story content that's deemed unnecessary must be abandoned. Most of said content is removed during drafting of the screenplay then again on the film editors cutting room floor. With that being said, I have only one tiny complaint. In this book at the end of this story, Edward and Bella with their supernatural family watch a sunset together sparkling in the sun. I really wanted to see this scene, but they left it out. It probably never made into the screenplay. Who knows?I was thrilled to recognize Carter Burwell's familiar, beautifully haunting musical score during this film. He is responsible for writing and scoring the beautiful 'Bella's Lullaby' and the score to the very first 'Twilight' film. He wrote and orchestrated the score to 'Breaking Dawn Part-1, and again this film 'Breaking Dawn Part-2'. Also, Christina Perri's lovely 'A Thousand Years' which is Bella and Edward's eternity love-theme song is back to perfectly close this last chapter of the 'Twilight Saga.'""Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2"" is not perfect or an Oscar contender for the 2012 Academy Awards, but it still has a purpose and place in our entertainment landscape. The vampires and werewolves have been prowling around Hollywood finding work my entire life and I believe this story and these films are a testament to the fact that we are not done with them yet. I highly recommended this film to the fantasy and paranormal romance lovers everywhere.

All the hype up to this one isn't exactly what I would have wanted to see.  I personally like the very 1st one of this saga (twilight) & loved the 4th one( Breaking Dawn part 1) and I think this last last one could have been shortened & included with Breaking Dawn pt. 1.  Still love the entire saga and I recommend it to anyone looking to see fantasy/love story.  I never thought I would like any of this until I saw the previews of Breaking Dawn pt. 1 and realized there was a human having a vampire baby & I just couldn't possibly understand that so I had to purchase the first 3 before I went to the movies to see these last two.

Her books are amazingly written and the entire series was so unique and different: page turning.  The first four movies I really enjoyed because I saw the books come alive on the screen- all of the scenese, conversations, people that I had imagined from Meyer's writing.  For the first four movies I saw each of tehm in theatres and purchased on DVD.  BD part 2 was the only movie of the series that I sat in the theatre watching with utter disappointment and even embarassment and did not see in duplicate.  I debated whether or not I should even purchase DVD, but after a shelf full of multiple copies of the Twilight books, the movie companions, and the DVDs, I thought ""well, let's give it another shot.""  Oh. It's still bad on DVD.What I didn't like:*the deviation from the novels. (by now you can figure it out from the trailers the whole ""new scene"" which wasn't entirely bad per se- but I felt betrayed because the first four movies were so similar to Meyer's original tales. But there is some new dialog that I really didn't like- and scene changes (Nessie's room full maxed out instead of empty like in the book). these might seem like sublities but to a Twilight fan.. I'm not amuzed.*the acting. I felt that Kristen Stewart was really good as Bella-human but watching her try to portray Bella-vampire really made me doubt her as an actor. Bad. really bad translation. some of her moments are so stiff and starch and her dialog seemed forced- even off at times.  Some of the other Cullen's performances were less than what I grew to expect... and I couldn't stop thinking how sickly Stewart looked- her dramatic weightloss looks unhealthy and I'm supposed to believe she is this diamond hard strong vampire. Ugh.*love scenese felt forced. I kept thinking, these two are/were a couple in real life during these scenes and- wow- I really didn't believe it. I didn't believe that they were Bella and Edward from the books let along Robert and Kristen real life couple.*the baby. Rennesme looked almost animatronic at times. The baby was creepy- really creepy. There were points in the movie where I didn't want to even look at it- with the amazing CGI they did for the wedding adn the wolves from the previous movies- I really had high expectations- they were dropped.*the music. I have all four soundtracks from the first movies with most of the mp3 tracks ripped onto my iphone and ipod. The songs selected for t his movie were really dull and monotone. I definetly didn't buy the sountrack this time around but I didn't even like the music or score in the movie- the songs seemed forced.I wouldn't buy this DVD. I wouldn't bother watching the movie.  For those that are Twilight critics to begin with, please do not judge the whole series or the novels based on this movie.to note: I still absolutely love some of the amazing actors and actresses that performed in BD part 2.

There was a blink you missed it shot of Sam, Seth and the back of Leah's head during a Christmas gathering. That was it! They show up in their wolf form at the finale but aside from Jacob hanging around to babysit his future bride he didn't have much importance here either. Why was this?? I will say Breaking Dawn was always my least favorite of the books because I did not agree with the direction the storyline took. So I do think the director did the most with the material. I also have grown fond of all the actors playing their characters and think they all did a fine job.*********MILD SPOILERS*********I was also baffled by Jacob's about face. 'You guys look great together' when he sees Bella and Edward after her rebirth. Wait...wasn't this the girl you would have died for a few days ago? I'm sorry, the whole imprint thing just never resonated with me. I would have liked to see Jacob have to pick up the pieces and find his own happiness (with someone who could relate, like Leah), not settle for the ex love of his life's daughter. And does he no longer attend school? He just hangs around the Cullen's mansion full time now?I did like some of the vampire friends and think they made some great casting decisions. The actors playing Alistiar, Kate, Tanya, Benjamin, and Eleazar were surprisingly interesting and added some depth (though the movie had no clear beginning, it just felt like it left off where the other one ended, kind of like a to be continued on a tv show).I also felt sentimental and a little sad when they showed the ending montage of all characcters throughout the series.

I see the movies as a way to bring the books to life and if you've read the books your brain can automatically fill in content where needed as you watch. That didn't really work in Breaking Dawn 2. I thought this film was choppy, no scene every felt complete. Also, the emotional connection from the characters was lacking in this film. Kristen Stewart has taken a lot of bashing but I thought she looked stunning and did a good job with the material she was given. Pattinson did an okay job as Edward but I didn't think he looked as good...odd. Lautner was solid as Jacob.I hated the ending! SPOILER - I loved the way the book ended and the way Bella came into her own power but that was minimized in the film. Like many other people, I fell in love with the characters in the book and I did not want to see them killed so the battle scene wasn't something I enjoyed. It also didn't feel as though it really fit with the plot...it was more like something the studio and Director put in because they wanted a big budget battle scene.

They basically write a synopsis of the book, why?! It AIN'T the MOVIE!! I wish Amazon would review the 'reviews' better and delete the ones that have zero relivance to the actual movie/book, whatever. Also...ANY SPOILERS should be deleted....not everyone wants to read a rant about 'this and that' in a film they haven't seen yet. i've had many a movie ruined bc someone just couldn't keep their yaps shut. Wish those would be deleted as well.Ok, NOW, I saw the film last night, and I WILL NOT BE PUTTING IN SPOILERS, so you can read on and not worry about having it screwed up for you.It was very well done. The action, the script, the detail, was all excellent and it did follow the book well. There were several differences, which I won't go into, but believe me, if you're a fan of the books you'll def notice them. ;)I would love to say more, but being a person who hates spoilers I won't...once you see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about...lets just say, you'll be talking about it when you leave.My only beef, when you have movies that are two parts, and the second part begins, you almost feel like you're in a limbo. In essence, you're starting a 'new' film in the middle of the story and feel a tad off balance. I would've really liked it, and it would've only added about 5 minutes or less to this installment, if they'd added in the last scene of the first movie (when she's on the table and Rosalee and Alice are cleaning her up and she's changing)...just to blend them better and make you feel like you're on more solid ground. I think it would've been a nice add; and would've made the audience happy to see a bit from the first part to seamlessly blend into the second. Even if it was from the birth on....I think it wouldn't have taken anything away from it, only adding to it and making the transition more complete.  I def felt like I was watching two different films. That being said, I can understand why, to an extent, because they were ending one chapter and beginning another. I just would've like it better the other way.Good conclusion for the movies, but I feel a tad sad, too. You really don't know how much you've invested in characters until the series comes to a close. The Cullen's were a tigh-knit family that loved each other and were devoted and loyal.  Traits that aren't overly apparent in todays society of divorce, anger filled family lives, discontent and so on. Strangly, it's a family I wouldn't mind marrying into if it existed.

Threatened, the volturri, as they're called, assemble to Forks to possibly launch a battle over the little girls future. There are few things to credit in the twilight finale: 1 would be the battle sequence that occurs towards the end of the flick, and the other would be Michael Sheen, who proves that it is fun to be a psychotic bad guy. The issues with this movie are still the same with the other movies leading up to this. Hilariously bad dialogue still exists, and the characters still fail to give us any reason to care about themEven though the series is out the door, and Stephanie Meyer is still making off this, with Stephanie's new adaptation The Host materializing in theaters at the end of next month, I guess 1 would have to wonder if that one's gonna have any brains to impress us.

However, say what you want about Kristen Stewart, but her rendering of Bella after the &#34;big change&#34; is fantastic.  Bella is stronger, sexier, more confident and secure in her own (cold) skin, and absolutely decisive about where her heart belongs and why.  The only part that made no sense is when Jacob phases in front of Bella's father, Chief Swan.Otherwise, I liked that Part 2 turned into a vampire convention--multiple vampire covens plus the Volturi.  However, since I'm also partial to &#34;Team Jacob&#34;, I didn't like the fact that most of the New Moon wolves were not in this film excepting &#34;Sam&#34; (Chaske Spencer), &#34;Leah&#34; (Julia Jones) and &#34;Seth&#34; (Boo Boo Stewart).

1617207,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B00AW0KHTM,D. A. Reed,"[3, 9]","I wish I had seen this on opening night with a theater full of Twihards (they at least entertain me). I'll admit they are enthusiastic and are passionate (but please take a joke, no book/film/TV is free of this), unlike when I saw Harry Potter 7 Part 2, there was never one reaction from the audience except when Julie Walters kills Helena Bonham Carter. So I settled for an audience of nine (myself and my cousin included) this past Wednesday and I while I still think this franchise is an uninspired piece of crap, I was entertained by the sheer badness of it. Twilight and New Moon were horrible, Eclipse was OK and Breaking Dawn Part 1 was everything I hated about the first two movies times ten. This half was paced better and it seemed to go by rather quick for only an hour and fifty six minutes (I'll concede that Harry Potters 1 & 2 drag and are a chore for me to sit through and I enjoy that series). And like my complaint with Deathly Hallows being split in two, Breaking Dawn could've easily been one movie (it's bad enough that Hunger Games final book will be split in two). The cinematography was also very good but that's where my compliments end.To get this out of the way; Edward as boring as ever and he needs to speak louder than a whisper so that way the audience can understand what he is saying. And for the love of god say it with a sense of urgency so that way you can sell the Voltori (did I spell that right) as a legitimate threat! Jacob just comes off as being a pedophile, waiting for when Renesme (did I spell that stupid name right) to grow older. Speaking of the child growing older; do several years pass in this movie as we see her grow or is she growing in real time before our eyes! The other vampires really don't do much of anything, same goes for the werewolves. And what's with the random super-powers some of these sparklers have? One has the power of Captain Planet (minus heart because this is Twilight), another has zappy powers and another has the powers of illusion. Any explanation? The CGI baby is the worst piece of CG I've ever seen (was it so hard to find a real baby or did it want to much money? Couldn't have been as costly as that fake baby)! And last I come to the open-mouthed, stuttering wonder herself; Bella! This girl has sacrificed nothing to get where she is and I mean nothing. She gets what she wants. No character arc, she's the same selfish girl she was when we first met her. People are risking their lives for her and she could care less if they die in the process. Edward was right to use her as a human shield during the ""climax"". I'd make a Kristen Stewart joke but that'd be like beating a dead horse.And now to move on to the more controversial part of the film: the ending. I hear the book pissed off a lot of people when it was released. There was a build up to a confrontation and that never happened. This movie gives us a climax that's pretty impressive for this franchise. You have main characters getting offed, Dakota Fanning (after giving her one word of dialog, again money well spent) who was supposed to be this bada** character runs like a coward. My cousin, who I spoiled the ending for a few days earlier, was still in shock seeing Carlisle's severed head in Aro's hand (who made both of us die with his out of nowhere laugh scene, which rival's Voldemort's in Deathly Hallows 2). If only I could've cared about all of those werewolves falling into the earth but I had no idea which one was which other than Jacob who was running with vampire-Jesus girl in the opposite direction. Then Edward and Bella both have their only bada** moment in four films after taking down Aro and... it's all a dream. Yup you read that right, this movie pulled a freakin' Dallas for a lame copout (in all seriousness, no one I talked to got the Dallas reference but my sister got the comparison when I brought up an episode of Batman: The Animated Series. Even people who grew up and watched the show didn't get it and I've never even seen Dallas). This fight was the only time in all the films where I felt invested in what was going on and this one moment ruined it for me. There was this lady a few seats away from us who said ""What!?"" and the people in front of us weren't all that pleased either with conclusion. And then when they started the end credits and started showing every single character (and their actor) who's been in this franchise, I couldn't help but think of another book-to-film series that ended the same way. I understand why they did it but I also don't understand it. I had to ask my cousin who half of these characters were (like the three evil vampires from the very first movie or Bella's friends who never featured that much).So out of four films (like Deathly Hallows, I count this as one) I think one and a half are OK. But overall, the franchise is pretty bad with boring characters and a bad plot (Bella and Edward's romance better than Scarlett and Rhett's? Seriously Stephanie Meyers?). I can't understand how these books/movies became so popular when there is much better vampire lore out there like Dracula or Dark Shadows (not the Johnny Depp movie). Though now that there's no more Twilight movies anymore, I've nothing else to look to forward to. Except the Hobbit Trilogy (an unnecessary trilogy but I'll take it over this any day). Les Miserables. Iron Man 3. Thor 2. Man of Steel (wow there's a lot I'm looking forward to over the next several months).",3,Crap But At Least It Was Entertaining Crap,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,5467,"['wish', 'had', 'seen',

1617235,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00AW0KHTM,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[0, 1]","""Breaking Dawn Part 2,"" directed by Bill Condon and written by Melissa Rosenberg, brings the adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series to a conclusion, giving fans a glimpse at the ""forever"" life and love that their favorite vampire couple and their incorporated families will be experiencing without the intrusion of cameras rolling. Achieving all the peak moments of the novel within a film version of over two hours is asking a lot.  It has a lot of ground to cover with issues building and snowballing from the other three novels to resolve--each of which could be a film in itself.  In order to meet fan expectation, Bella and Edward must be seen as the lovers and partners they were meant to be; they must get their romantic happily-ever-after amidst the stress of immediate parenthood to a hybrid child whose destiny as either a vampire or human is unknown. As Bella's jilted suitor, Jacob must discover a love of his own.  Bella's father must be primed to accept her rebirth as a vampire and Bella herself must come to understand herself not only as a new vampire with powers and strengths of which she never dreamed, or as a member of the Cullen family that will exist forever, doing whatever it is they do for eternity, but as a 19 year-old wife and mother, the responsibility of which sends many ""normal"" and much older women into a tale-spin.  Add to all these abrupt changes the advent of the Volturi who impose a direct threat on the lives of Bella's new family because the nature of her daughter Renesmee may eventually harm the entire vampire race.  It is no wonder Meyer's novel (Breaking Dawn)spans over 750 pages.Does this film version successfully show the outcome of Bella's decision to become a vampire as the positive resolution of all of her struggles regarding herself depicted in all of the novels?  It really tries.  However, the climatic ending of the film devotes much time, energy and action to an exciting battle scene of grand proportion, visually pleasing the eyes, but leaving little time to concentrate on more mellow themes with any real depth.Fans may disagree that the first Twilight film directed by Catherine Hardwicke did not portray the characters correctly for die-hard Twilight fans. At least, that first Bella and Edward franchise accomplished its mission and depicted the angst of a 100-year-old vampire and his wannabe girlfriend as high school students experiencing first love even if one of them has the temperature of a dead fish and the other looks as if she cracked a smile her face would freeze. The Twilight soundtrack (Twilight Soundtrack) puts together some great alternative music and Carter Burwell's Bella's Lullaby captures the sense of forbidden love in one of the most beautiful piano pieces written in a long time.""Breaking Dawn, Part 2"" in comparison seems like an afterthought, with just a slight nod to the all important theme of the once klutz-y and introverted Bella of Twilight finally coming into her own and finding her place as a mother, wife and protectress to her newfound vampire family.  Instead this film seems like a vampire Who's Who for fans who simply cannot bear to not know how Hollywood depicts Twilight author Stephanie Meyer's global cavalcade of supernatural characters who decide to aid the Cullens by protecting Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella's (Kristen Stewart) hybrid offspring Renesmee from the Volturi who declare that any `Immortal Child' poses a danger to the tribe and must die.The audience already knows from the ending ofThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1that Jacob (Taylor Lautner who, of course, predictably shows off his bare wolfcake chest in a sequence where he reveals his ""otherness"" to Bella's father (Billy Burke)) has imprinted (it's a wolf thing) on the infant Renesmee and, thankfully, as both Meyer and the filmmakers understand that big boy Jacob's fixation on a baby could be interpreted as pedophilia, allow the tot to be a victim of what soap opera shows call rapid aging syndrome.  What else could they do? Nonetheless, her growth spurts do not sprout fast enough; the child, a disturbing and distorted amalgam of digital graphics and actual children, is safely shown mostly with Jacob in CG wolf form--this girl and trusty dog version most likely considered more tasteful than the hybrid/human alternative. Courtesy of an Alice vision, the audience gets a glimpse of Jacob and an older more glamorous Renesmee caressing each other while Bella and Edward look on.  All are forever young, in love and complete as a foursome now rather than an awkward trio.Although the other films, Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse, depict the Cullen's in a cheerfully humorous manner--the clan cuts up together and roast each other with the same aplomb as any real family--in Breaking Dawn, Part 2, the goofy Brady Bunch camaraderie aspect of this seems more evident, more a substitute for an actual storyline and definitely not as well-received or forgiven. Every one of the vampires seems overly stylized and uber-Botoxed with neatly trimmed eyebrows and carefully selected Eurotrash clothes.As one of the newly initiated, Kristin Stewart perpetually sports her signature frown; her status as vampire does not change her uncomfortable demeanor no matter how polished a skin her rebirth affords her. Understandably, her family is in dire jeopardy, but Kristin's Bella doesn't smile enough to validate her very serious decisions or the fact that she is really happy.  Her ability to ""shield"" is explained too quickly and without the momentous impact it should have on a girl that is so awkward she can barely walk in high heels.Bottom line? ""Breaking Dawn, Part 2"" tries so hard to resolve all the issues and loose ends of the previous films, but ends up, battle scene aside, as a glossy photo album whose theme is ""All's well, that ends well."" Sure, fans get to see Bella and Edward living in happily wedded bliss in their fairytale cottage and later watching on as an older Renesmee and forever-young Jacob enjoy their mutual feelings. And this may be enough.  However, much of Bella's conclusions about herself as expressed in the novel are skimmed over rather than focused upon.  Again, those who are fanatically extremely familiar with the novels will fill in the blanks and revel in this final segment of the saga of their much beloved characters.  Recommended only for those who need to see Bella as a vampire, or want to watch a vampire battle extraordinaire.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,All in the Family,1362873600,"03 10,

I loved all of the Twilight Series books.  I did not like all of the Movies.I thoroughly enjoyed Twilight the first movie in the series. I found it to be a very pleasurable and there was never a dull moment. It gave the characters of the book the uniqueness and personalities of what I expected from the book. The movie gave life to the book in a way that was very pleasurable and made me want more. I could not wait to see the next movie in the series.New Moon the second movie in the series kept the story moving while not giving away all that will be happening in the future books or movies. It showed the intensity of the love between Bella and Edward. It also showed the intense relationship of Bella with Jacob. I loved the scene in the movie where time went by month by month and you could feel Bella's pain and aloneness. There were some really good scenes that were touching and added to the love story of Edward and Bella while leaving you wanting to see more of the story of Bella, Jacob, Edward, and the rest of the characters in the book.The third book and movie Eclipse was also exceptionally enjoyable. I found all the Characters personalities were brought out even more and it made you understand and love the Cullen family even more. It brought the story to a new level of intensity. It gave us more information about the characters themselves. I was impressed with the Wolves and the fights. This movie also left us wanting to see the rest of the Twilight Story.Then the fourth book and movie Breaking Dawn part 1 came out. Within the first 30 minutes of the movie I was totally disappointed. They had changed the story or added to it.  They had put information in the movie that did not add to the story itself. What they added made me wonder if the director understood what people that read the books enjoyed about the Twilight Series books.I wondered if they just needed to add time to the movie to make 2 movies out of the one book.  I really felt they could have done the last book all in one movie and when the last movie came out they proved that they could have done a much better movie by using the original story of Breaking Dawn.There were so many moving moments in the book Breaking Dawn that were left out of the Movie. The Characters in the book and their stories were left out of the breaking Dawn movies.  There were so many moving moments in the book that were left out of Breaking Dawn part 1 and part 2. Both of he Breaking Dawn Movies were a total disappointment.In fact I was so disappointed and bored with the movie that I did not even want to see the end of the Movie.With the first 3 books and Movies I reread orI rewatched the movies several times thoroughly enjoying them. The fourth movie Breaking Dawn part 1 I tried to watch it a second time before I went to go see Breaking Dawn part 2. I didn't get all the way through the movie and I just turned it off.I really feel the first 3 movies are the real stories of the lives of the people in the Twilight Series books and that the last 2 movies are not from the same Twilight series books and I was totally disappointed with both Breaking Dawns.",2,I have read the books and seen all of the movies ...,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,3269,"['read', 'Twilight', 'series', 'books', 'own', 'Movies', 'latest', 'one', 'only', 'out', 'theaters', 'right', 'now', 'loved', 'Twilight', 'Series', 'books', 'did', 'not', 'Movies.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Twilight', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'pleasurable', 'was', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'gave', 'characters', 'book', 'uniqueness', 'personalities', 'what', 'expected', 'book', 'movie', 'gave', 'life', 'book', 'way', 'was', 'very', 'pleasurable', 'made', 'want', 'more', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'next', 'movie', 'series.New', 'Moon', 'second', 'movie', 'series', 'kept', 'story', 'moving', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'will', 'be', 'happening', 'future', 'books', 'movies', 'showed', 'intensity', 'love', 'Bella', 'Edward', 'also', 'showed', 'intense', 'relationship', 'Bella', 'Jacob', 'loved', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'time', 'went', 'month', 'month', 'could', 'feel', 'Bella', 'pain', 'aloneness', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'scenes', 'were', 'touching', 'added', 'love', 'story', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'story', 'Bella', 'Jacob', 'Edward', 'rest', 'characters', 'book.The', 'third', 'book', 'movie', 'Eclipse', 'was', 'also', 'exceptionally', 'enjoyable', 'found', 'Characters', 'personalities', 'were', 'brought', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'made', 'understand', 'love', 'Cullen', 'family', 'even', 'more', 'brought', 'story', 'new', 'level', 'intensity', 'gave', 'more', 'information', 'characters', 'was', 'impressed', 'Wolves', 'fights', 'movie', 'also', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'rest', 'Twilight', 'Story.Then', 'fourth', 'book', 'movie', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'part', '1', 'came', 'out', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'totally', 'disappointed', 'had', 'changed', 'story', 'added', 'had', 'put', 'information', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'story', 'What', 'added', 'made', 'wonder', 'director', 'understood', 'what', 'people', 'read', 'books', 'enjoyed', 'Twilight', 'Series', 'books.I', 'wondered', 'just', 'needed', 'add', 'time', 'movie', 'make', '2', 'movies', 'one', 'book', 'really', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'last', 'book', 'one', 'movie', 'when', 'last', 'movie', 'came', 'proved', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'using', 'original', 'story', 'Breaking', 'Dawn.There', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'moving', 'moments', 'book', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'were', 'left', 'Movie', 'Characters', 'book', 'stories', 'were', 'left', 'breaking', 'Dawn', 'movies', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'moving', 'moments', 'book', 'were', 'left', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'part', '1', 'part', '2', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Movies', 'were', 'total', 'disappointment.In', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'bored', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'want', 'see', 'end', 'Movie.With', 'first', '3', 'books', 'Movies', 'reread', 'orI', 'rewatched', 'movies', 'several', 'times', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'fourth', 'movie', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'part', '1', 'tried', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'part', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'movie', 'just', 'turned', 'off.I', 'really', 'feel', 'first', '3', 'movies', 'are', 'real', 'stories', 'lives', 'people', 'Twilight', 'Series', 'books', 'last', '2', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'Twilight', 'series', 'books', 'was', 'totally', 'disappointed', 'Breaking', 'Dawns']",N/A

After five movies of stone-faced melodramatic drivel, the ""Twilight"" movie series is finally over... until Stephenie Meyer churns out a few more books.But until that happens, ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2"" marks the end of this irritatingly omnipresent series about sparkly vampires. Bill Condon is doing what he can with what he has, but even a brilliantly violent climactic battle can't cover up the fact that this entire movie is like a faked orgasm -- a lot of buildup with a awkward, empty denouement.Having been made a vampire, Bella (Kristen Stewart) wakes up and is instantly perfect -- perfect super-strength, perfect superpowers, perfect skin, perfect hair, a perfect vampire pseudo-family with a perfect (creepy) CGI baby. There's only one non-perfect thing: Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has imprinted on baby Renesmee, meaning that they are soulmates. How wonderfully pedophilic.But don't worry. Bella gets over it, and retires to a perfect luxury cottage in the perfect woods to have perfect sex with Edward (Robert Pattinson), complete with perfect sparkly orgasms. I wish I were kidding. Sparkly orgasms!But then another vampire spots Renesmee, and reports to the Volturi that the Cullens have made an ""immortal child,"" which is forbidden. So the Cullen clan does the only logical thing: it starts calling in random vampire buddies to come hang out at their house, so they can fight if and when the Volturi attack. If this sounds exciting, I can assure you that it's not.You would think the build-up to a battle between two vampire gangs would be pretty awesome. Sadly, it's not -- most of the movie consists of people standing around talking, while reminding us that the Volturi (who are basically how Stephenie Meyer sees Catholics) are cartoonishly evil and just want a reason to wipe out the vampire Mormons.But the slow build-up is tedious rather than intense -- most of the plot is just about random vampires hanging out at the Cullens' mansion, and showing off their OMG-SO-KEWL powers. The dialogue is clunky (""If we live through this, I'll follow you anywhere, woman"") and the dramatic/romantic moments are delivered with such clunky awkwardness that it's impossible to take them seriously.And I feel bad for Bill Condon, who tries to wedge action and excitement wherever he can. He's trying so, so hard. In fact, he deviates sharply from Meyer's sludgy book near the end, and for a brief few minutes, we are treated to a gloriously violent, acrobatic battle scene -- major characters are brutally killed, chasms open in the earth's crust, and heads are torn off at random. It's absolutely brilliant...... until we find out that it was all a psychic vision. Yeah. The big exciting climax? It never happened. Everybody just wanders off home and nothing is ultimately resolved.In fact, the climax is so unsatisfying that two minor characters actually start yelling about how stupid it is. Instead of an epic battle, we get a final massive dose of diabetes-inducing treacle, which just shows us why the ""Twilight"" series is not, and never has been, a ""saga.""As usual, the acting ranges from bored (Pattinson) to wooden (Lautner). Kristen Stewart is the worst one here, because after four movies of mumbling and biting her lip... she's finally trying to ACT. The scene where Bella yells, ""You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness Monster?!"" is absolute comedy gold, and I couldn't help but wonder if Pattinson's chuckling in the background was just because of how BAD she was.The worst part is that most of the new vampires are actually potentially interesting characters, and are played by some decent actors. Don't expect much backstory, though. You'll be disappointed.""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2"" is build up as an epic clash to finish off the series... but instead you get a massive puff of stale-smelling air.

Not that watching Robert and Kirsten is any better than, say, watching two strange dogs in the alley - but at least I could fast-forward through all that.This review in particular must be prefaced by two things: 1) I am not wasting a second reading any of the dumb books upon which these films are based; 2) These reviews are meant to be somewhat humorous so, no, I do not have ""spelling problems"".The Great Roger Ebert said an adaptation does not have to be faithful to the book and I agree, so in that sense I couldn't care less! Therefore I won't be reading any of these novels at all, and I hardly think I have spelling problems but if I misspell a character's name I actually DO NOT CARE.So, I imagine that the 162 or so reviews that are already here are pretty thorough. I will be able to indulge in some of my problems and questions, which are obviously not all that serious in any case. I'll be able to pay some of the most heartfelt compliments I ever had the chance to express toward this series. And I don't just say that because it is over - which it probably isn't.As the fans know, this 'final' part begins with Bella (I'm just calling her ""BELA"" henceforth, as in ""LUGOSI"") becoming a ""newborn"" vampire, but also with the bumbling couple dealing with their daughter Reneeesmeee. See, I don't give two farts about spelling here. What I enjoyed was the film's poking some fun at itself, as evidenced by Jacob the werewolf nicknaming the girl Nessie. That was cute. Later everyone takes to calling her ""Ness"".Kirsten in a hilariously evil moment, screaming at Jacob: ""YOU NICKNAMED MY DAUGHTER AFTER THE LOCH NESS MONSTER??!!""Naturally, since the girl is born while her mother is still human, we will see the consequences of that. The ending was a most stunning, interesting surprise for me but I hated that ruling caste of vampires and I still hate them. Michael Sheen has accomplished the task of making himself look like he's lost more marbles and suffered more loose screws since the first time we met his character. Dakota Fanning appears, but as usual, she gets paid for just standing there and having oxblood-colored eyes.Some things that bothered me:- Why was Alice so successful in her machinations here?- Why was she not seized when the other side had the chance? Hasn't her story all along been about how much the 'Vultures' want her?- What were those two vampires, whom I thought were Russian? Were they the old Romanian dudes out of Transylvania? I got that impression, but then one of them would have had to be Vlad Tepes.- Bela's father, Charlie, is clearly on his way to being accepted into the Wolf Tribe, and Jacob reveals himself to Charlie. What is the big friggin' deal about Bela and everyone else coming clean? Charlie is the coolest character - and Billy Burke the best actor - so why not just tell him? He could help in the future! I mean, did you see how he hugged his daughter though she was as cold as death? - HE DIDN'T CARE, as long as he could hold her again!!(And don't give me this line about the Vultures. If they left everyone else alone, they would have left Charlie alone - or better yet, Bela could have changed him.)- So ... Jacob actually only loved Bela all this time because of the as-yet unborn child upon whom he imprinted? I know the story well enough to understand this, and Alice provides us with a vision of them happy together in the near future. What I did not like was the pablum about how the baby was the cause of the whole Jacob-Bela thing. That was just stupid. The werewolves are NOT psychic.- My biggest pet peeve: how can someone be half immortal and half mortal? What the hell does that mean? They grow up in two days and then stay 21 years old for the rest of eternity? That wasn't answered for me at all, but I am beyond wishing I will figure out this juvenile story.Anyway, I liked it enough to sit through it and watch it to the bitter end, so I guess most of you will LOVE it.",3,"""We're the same temperature now""",1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,4068,"['TWILIGHT', 'SAGA', 'BREAKING', 'DAWN', 'PART', '2', '113', 'minutes', 'was', 'lot', 'easier', 'watch', 'predecessors', 'Not', 'watching', 'Robert', 'Kirsten', 'better', 'say', 'watching', 'two', 'strange', 'dogs', 'alley', 'least', 'could', 'fast-forward', 'that.This', 'review', 'particular', 'must', 'be', 'prefaced', 'two', 'things', '1', 'am', 'not', 'wasting', 'second', 'reading', 'dumb', 'books', 'films', 'are', 'based', '2', 'reviews', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'somewhat', 'humorous', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'spelling', 'problems', 'Great', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'said', 'adaptation', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'faithful', 'book', 'agree', 'so', 'sense', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'Therefore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'reading', 'novels', 'hardly', 'think', 'have', 'spelling', 'problems', 'misspell', 'character', 'name', 'actually', 'DO', 'NOT', 'CARE.So', 'imagine', '162', 'so', 'reviews', 'are', 'already', 'here', 'are', 'pretty', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'indulge', 'problems', 'questions', 'are', 'obviously', 'not', 'serious', 'case', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'pay', 'most', 'heartfelt', 'compliments', 'ever', 'had', 'chance', 'express', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'say', 'probably', ""isn't.As"", 'fans', 'know', ""'final"", 'part', 'Bella', ""'m"", 'just', 'calling', 'BELA', 'henceforth', 'LUGOSI', 'becoming', 'newborn', 'vampire', 'also', 'bumbling', 'couple', 'dealing', 'daughter', 'Reneeesmeee', 'See', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'two', 'farts', 'spelling', 'here', 'What', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'film', 'poking', 'fun', 'evidenced', 'Jacob', 'werewolf', 'nicknaming', 'girl', 'Nessie', 'was', 'cute', 'Later', 'everyone', 'calling', 'Ness', '.Kirsten', 'hilariously', 'evil', 'moment', 'screaming', 'Jacob', 'YOU', 'NICKNAMED', 'MY', 'DAUGHTER', 'AFTER', 'THE', 'LOCH', 'NESS', 'MONSTER', 'Naturally', 'girl', 'born', 'mother', 'still', 'human', 'will', 'see', 'consequences', 'ending', 'was', 'most', 'stunning', 'interesting', 'surprise', 'hated', 'ruling', 'caste', 'vampires', 'still', 'hate', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'accomplished', 'task', 'making', 'look', 'lost', 'more', 'marbles', 'suffered', 'more', 'loose', 'screws', 'first', 'time', 'met', 'character', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'usual', 'paid', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'having', 'oxblood-colored', 'eyes.Some', 'things', 'bothered', 'Why', 'was', 'Alice', 'so', 'successful', 'machinations', 'here', 'Why', 'was', 'not', 'seized', 'when', 'other', 'side', 'had', 'chance', 'Has', ""n't"", 'story', 'been', 'how', 'much', ""'Vultures"", 'want', 'What', 'were', 'two', 'vampires', 'whom', 'thought', 'were', 'Russian', 'Were', 'old', 'Romanian', 'Transylvania', 'got', 'impression', 'then', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'be', 'Vlad', 'Tepes.-', 'Bela', 'father', 'Charlie', 'clearly', 'way', 'being', 'accepted', 'Wolf', 'Tribe', 'Jacob', 'Charlie', 'What', 'big', 'friggin', 'deal', 'Bela', 'everyone', 'else', 'coming', 'clean', 'Charlie', 'coolest', 'character', 'Billy', 'Burke', 'best', 'actor', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'tell', 'could', 'help', 'future', 'mean', 'did', 'see', 'how', 'hugged', 'daughter', 'was', 'as', 'cold', 'death', 'HE', ""N'T"", 'CARE', 'as', 'long', 'could', 'hold', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'line', 'Vultures', 'left', 'everyone', 'else', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'Charlie', 'alone', 'better', 'yet', 'Bela', 'could', 'have', 'changed', 'So', 'Jacob', 'actually', 'only', 'loved', 'Bela', 'time', 'as-yet', 'unborn', 'child', 'whom', 'imprinted', 'know', 'story', 'well', 'enough', 'understand', 'Alice', 'vision', 'happy', 'together', 'near', 'future', 'What', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'pablum', 'how', 'baby', 'was', 'cause', 'whole', 'Jacob-Bela', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'werewolves', 'are', 'NOT', 'psychic.-', 'My', 'biggest', 'pet', 'peeve', 'how', 'can', 'someone', 'be', 'half', 'immortal', 'half', 'mortal', 'What', 'hell', 'mean', 'grow', 'up', 'two', 'days', 'then', 'stay', '21', 'years', 'old', 'rest', 'eternity', 'was', ""n't"", 'answered', 'am', 'wishing', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'juvenile', 'story.Anyway', 'liked', 'enough', 'sit', 'watch', 'bitter', 'end', 'guess', 'most', 'will', 'LOVE']",N/A

Most are dragged to the theater or plopped down on the couch at home against their will while their girlfriends or wives view them. My experience is the exact opposite. My wife hates the films and I'm forced to see them either alone or with my son amongst a sea of teens and their mothers whooping over Jacob or Edward.Sometimes it can be hard to evaluate a film accurately sitting at a midnight screening surrounded by fanatics of the franchise. Surpisingly, my opinion of ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" didn't change much between seeing it in the theater and in a home entertainment environment. I would say it's by far my second favorite of the movies right behind ""Eclipse.""""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" picks up with Bella awakening as a vampire and trying to control her powers and thirst. Edward and Bella's child, Renesmee, is growing at an incredible speed. This makes the Volturi nervous, which in turn causes Aro to investigate the child and decide if she poses a danger to the existence of vampires.Meanwhile, the Cullens travel the globe and gather witnesses to prove to the Volturi that Renesmee isn't a threat to the vampire's way of life and anonymity. When the Volturi travel to Forks to confront the Cullens, Jacob and his werewolf friends join Bella and her new family in what could be a battle to the death for many.Director Bill Condon does a good job with pacing for ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2."" Although most of the real action doesn't come to the very end, he keeps things interesting through international travels and the suspense of what the Volturi are going to do to rid themselves of Renesmee and the Cullens.I do have a couple complaints about the movie. The CGI is less than spectacular. Most sequences with CGI are overly glossy and way too noticeable. Renesmee as a baby is a perfect example of this problem. Edward and Bella's run through the woods tests the limits of the movie's budget for more green screen work as well.Some of the acting comes across as a bit awkward and over-dramatic at times as well. However, it fits with the soap opera-like tone of the movie. Let's just say it will find a nice home on the Lifetime Movie Network a few years from now after FX is done with it.Special features for the Blu-ray version of ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" kick off with audio commentary by Director Bill Condon. Twi-hards will be happy to know there is an in-depth one and a half hour documentary on the making of the film entitled ""Forever Filming 'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2."" There's also a six minute featurette about shooting two films at one time entitled ""Two Movies at Once."" Green Day's video for ""The Forgotten"" is included as well.The audio and video high definition transfers are picture perfect. At times, this works against it as it exposes the limitations of the CGI work. It's much easier to cover some of those flaws up on the big screen. The dialogue, special effects, musical score, and soundtrack all use the full extent of the 7.1 surround sound mix to their advantage.""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" is a fitting end for the franchise.

1617317,A2TWEEAD8BIUFW,B00AW0KHTM,"Gayle Price Thomas ""Gayle Price Thomas""","[0, 0]","My 13 year old grand daughter got me hooked on ""Twilight!"" I have all five movies. This finale ""Breaking Dawn 2"" was just fantastic. It was a great way to finalize everything that went on between the main three characters. I had sooo many favorites through out this saga. I read some reviews on the novel series and some weren't so good. But I think what some people fail to realize is, this is a fantasy created by the author's imagination. Being a fiction writer myself, I understand the concepts of fiction. The author creates a fictitious plot and make it. . . BELIEVABLE!! I didn't read the novels and novels are always claimed as being better than the, ""MOVIE."" I feel the movies were excellent. Each series took us deeper into the relationship between the three, and what each character's world entailed. One a human, one a vampire, and the other a werewolf.  I mean, even-though some felt the novels wasn't realistic, for me the movies were believable. I could relate to Bella because I already know what it's like as a human. Therefore, if had I met a vampire that could put me on his back, climb and fly me to the highest tree branch, and didn't have to worry about falling, oh yeah! Not to mention being able to view all of God's beautiful creations, then take me there! Or to have a huge werewolf protect me and when he was in human form looked as sweet as Jacob did, then he would be my BFF too! I wouldn't mind not having to eat, sleep, or being pale, and cold, if I could live in that house with the Cullen's. . . I know, but I'm just saying. You have to admit, that house in the woods was simply gorgeous. I loved Bella's Dad, he was just too cool. When writing a novel, sometimes the writer can't or shouldn't write and tell all. Sometimes we have to let the reader or viewer figure somethings out. For instance, in BD Part 2. . . When Bella decided to see Charlie, I noticed something. When he was hugging his daughter, he had this look on his face as to say. . . ""Why is she so cold?"" Along with a small gesture.  However, he didn't mention her being cold except by his expression. I don't know if anyone else noticed that but I did. And I think other's did too if they were paying close attention. I feel the same when Leah died helping Esme in the make believe fight. We know that in BD part one, Esme offered Leah a sandwich, but the wolf girl declined. She didn't care for the Cullens. I could see the disappointment in Esme's eyes. Yet, in the fight, Leah gave her life to help Esme. No words to say, ""I'm so sorry about the way I treated you."" Only a gesture. The same goes along with reading a novel. We have to pay attention to what we read and sometimes have an open heart. Last but not, least I feel the author used a formula that we all need whether fiction or reality. . . She wrote about three people being in love and all of the mentionable. The supporting cast all had someone to fight for and in the end, love conquered all. . .

1617382,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00AW0KHTM,Jason,"[12, 23]","So the wife finally dragged me to the final Twilight movie.  The series has had its ups and downs, but the final installment encapsulates the roller-coaster in and of itself.Breaking Dawn I left off with Bella (Kristen Stewart) ultimately choosing necrophilia over bestiality, knowing she couldn't get pregnant.  Uh, about that, Maury Povich is on line one for you.  So she went through a skeletal phase where the baby, unfortunately, didn't kill off Bella's character.  But it was close enough that Edward (Robert Pattinson) had to turn her into a sparkly vampire.The positives of this film are minimal.  It slightly extends the love saga between Bella and Edward, producing a child with her own story (put the pen down, Stephanie Meyer) while bringing a finalization to their tale.  Vampire folklore continues to get trampled, but within the framework of Twilight it stays consistent.  There's even a small development of how/when/why the werewolves begin to turn as a result of vampire presence which I thought was an interesting take.  Pattinson turns in a decent performance, but Ashley Greene continues to simultaneously be the most attractive and best actor in the entire series.  Last but not least, the climax had a very interesting twist that no doubt has M. Night Shyamalan slamming his head into a brick wall for not thinking of it first.  Oh, and no baseball scenes.  But that's about it.The negatives are too numerous to mention, but to start...The special effects in this film were really hokey.  In previous films the vampires abilities were realized with subtle, powerful grace, and the wolves posed menacing figures with strength and honor.  This time, however, it's a bunch of blur motions to show how fast the vampires run.  Add that to a poorly done baby (Renesmee) that looked more robot than vampire, and it became distracting.  Making it worse was the disconnect between events and dialogue.  At one point Bella is walking and talking normally with everyone else, but before meeting her father she has to be given a lesson on how to act human, as if she wasn't controlling her physical movements perfectly fine mere moments earlier.The script is straight up braindead.  It's very clear little thought was put into any of this, and it's not even remotely hidden.  Character is a vampire, ""Wow, you're cold.""  Character is strong, ""Wow, you're strong.""The other actors in the film are fairly bad.  Jacob (Taylor Lautner) fulfilled his contractual obligation to take off his shirt at least once, and that's about all he did.  Stewart is so bad she looks constipated in at least 50% of the movie.  She literally has no clue how to emote.  And if you haven't already seen/heard the ridiculously bad laugh from Michael Sheen (as Aro of the Volturi), then do yourself a favor and look it up on youtube.Unfortunately for the great twist at the end, there is a twist near the beginning (for those who haven't read the books), that got creepy immediately.

I want to defend it because there's a cheesy part of me who is attracted to the world that Stephenie Meyer has created. A world that is mostly aimed at the hearts of the young.But it's time for this series to come to an end. Cause it's becoming harder and harder to see the qualities in it. Movie wise, the special effects aren't the best, the acting level is debatable and the intelligence of the dialogues and intentions is more than ever reaching the level of a Michael Bay production.  For the first time I felt the financial greed behind the reality of this two-part story.  ""Breaking Dawn"", the novel, was a bit unnecessary, I thought. To my great surprise, ""Breaking Dawn Part One"", the movie, was very entertaining. But ""Breaking Dawn Part Two"" is the proof that the fourth novel didn't possess enough ""juice"" to break it in two movies.When Anne Rice finished ""Queen Of The Damned"", the third and final novel of the legendary trilogy of her vampire chronicles, she surprised us with a fourth novel (""The Tale Of The Body Thief"") which didn't necessarily continued the story but rather brought it to new and interesting levels of depths. But this fourth Twilight story is nothing close to bringing these vampires love stories to new and profound levels. It's simply stretching a trilogy that didn't need an epilogue cut in two films. The two main ideas of ""Breaking Dawn"" (the transformation of Bella and the birth of Renesmee and its effect on Jacob and the Volturi) could've been easily incorporated in ""Eclipse"", at the end, in a kind of epilogue that didn't show too much but let us wanting more, which is the way all good stories should end.  That's what ""Breaking Dawn"" is: an overlong, unnecessary epilogue.It's not that ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" is dull or completely uninteresting. It has its moment and there are scenes that hit home. The end is truly fun and the homage to the books (the flipping of the pages at the end) is touching. I even had regrets that they didn't spend enough time with Charlie and Bella's mother, especially showing us their reaction to what has happened in their daughter's life. But ultimately, that wasn't what ""Twilight"" was all about. What it was about was settled and delt with in the third movie (""Eclipse""). What this fourth novel (and two more movies) has brought is the acknowledgment that Stephenie Meyer's world, contrary to the universe of Anne Rice, for example, has its limits. I was never tired during the screening of ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"". Simply, I was finding the whole thing empty, like we were squeezing all the juice out of the story. And that there was not one single adventure left to tell in this world.",1,Can an unnecessary novel make a genuine good film?,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,2825,"['hard', 'defend', 'movie', 'insisting', 'having', 'such', 'insipid', 'dialogues', ""'re"", 'same', 'temperature', 'now', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Think', ""'d"", 'be', 'so', 'want', 'defend', 'cheesy', 'part', 'who', 'attracted', 'world', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'created', 'world', 'mostly', 'aimed', 'hearts', 'young.But', 'time', 'series', 'come', 'end', 'Cause', 'becoming', 'harder', 'harder', 'see', 'qualities', 'Movie', 'wise', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'acting', 'level', 'debatable', 'intelligence', 'dialogues', 'intentions', 'more', 'ever', 'reaching', 'level', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'production', 'first', 'time', 'felt', 'financial', 'greed', 'reality', 'two-part', 'story', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'novel', 'was', 'bit', 'unnecessary', 'thought', 'great', 'surprise', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', 'One', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', 'Two', 'proof', 'fourth', 'novel', 'did', ""n't"", 'possess', 'enough', 'juice', 'break', 'two', 'movies.When', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'finished', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'third', 'final', 'novel', 'legendary', 'trilogy', 'vampire', 'chronicles', 'surprised', 'fourth', 'novel', 'Tale', 'Body', 'Thief', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'continued', 'story', 'rather', 'brought', 'new', 'interesting', 'levels', 'depths', 'fourth', 'Twilight', 'story', 'nothing', 'close', 'bringing', 'vampires', 'love', 'stories', 'new', 'profound', 'levels', 'simply', 'stretching', 'trilogy', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'epilogue', 'cut', 'two', 'films', 'two', 'main', 'ideas', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'transformation', 'Bella', 'birth', 'Renesmee', 'effect', 'Jacob', 'Volturi', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'easily', 'incorporated', 'Eclipse', 'end', 'kind', 'epilogue', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'too', 'much', 'let', 'wanting', 'more', 'way', 'good', 'stories', 'should', 'end', 'what', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'overlong', 'unnecessary', 'epilogue.It', 'not', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', '2', 'dull', 'completely', 'uninteresting', 'moment', 'are', 'scenes', 'hit', 'home', 'end', 'truly', 'fun', 'homage', 'books', 'flipping', 'pages', 'end', 'touching', 'even', 'had', 'regrets', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'Charlie', 'Bella', 'mother', 'especially', 'showing', 'reaction', 'what', 'happened', 'daughter', 'life', 'ultimately', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'Twilight', 'was', 'about', 'What', 'was', 'about', 'was', 'settled', 'delt', 'third', 'movie', 'Eclipse', 'What', 'fourth', 'novel', 'two', 'more', 'movies', 'brought', 'acknowledgment', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'world', 'contrary', 'universe', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'example', 'limits', 'was', 'never', 'tired', 'screening', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', '2', 'Simply', 'was', 'finding', 'whole', 'thing', 'empty', 'were', 'squeezing', 'juice', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'adventure', 'left', 'tell', 'world']",N/A

The most over-blown, over-hyped, over-extended movie series ever made has at long last limped to a close.  They even threw in a fake battle scene to try to liven up the moronic book ending.  Not that it helped very much.""Breaking Dawn 2"" feels like a bunch of scenes that don't have much relation to each other strung together by a disjointed voice-over.  It doesn't even feel like a whole movie.  It's as if there was too much book for one film, but not enough for two.I can't see what was the purpose of making these movies except to send a bunch of pre-pubescent Twihards into fits of joy and make some mediocre actors into instant gazillionaires.  Kristen Stewart gives her usual lip-biting, mouth-breathing, one-note performance as Bella, trying to look fierce during the climactic fake battle scene and managing only to look somewhat constipated.  Robert Pattinson, a much better actor, does what he can with the excruciating lines he has to say (""We're the same temperature now.""  Really?)  Billy Burke does his usual superb acting job as Charlie, Bella's dad, but some of the other supporting roles (Rosalie, for instance) have been so truncated they hardly have anything to say.  Except for Jacob, the wolves don't do anything but act wolfy.  And the Volturi are nowhere near as menacing as they were in ""New Moon"" and ""Eclipse"".  Jane, for instance, was a truly diabolical character, meting out excruciating pain with a baby-faced simper.  Now she's just standing around wearing too much eyeliner looking as bored as the viewer feels watching her.(A few people asked that I put in the following caveat, so here goes a ***SPOILER ALERT***):As for the fake battle scene, it did help to liven up a stupefyingly boring confrontation between the good guys and the bad guys, but why did it have to be fake?  It would have been infinitely more satisfying to see Alice really handing Jane a taste of her own medicine, or Bella and Edward handing Aro his head.  But as in the book, it's all a cheat.  Nobody dies, nobody even gets hurt; Aro sees the future through Alice and decides this is something that can wait a few millenia, and he and the rest of the Volturi run off with their tails between their legs, leaving the good guys to...... to what?  What do these undead folks actually do all day?  Carlisle's an exception; he's a doctor, out doing some good in the world.  Esme keeps house.  But what about the rest of them?  Besides laying around and occasionally decimating the native wildlife population, what are Rosalie, Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Edward and Bella going to do for the rest of their endless existence?  We get through Alice's vision that at the ripe old age of seven, when she will be fully grown, Renesmee will run off with Jacob and they will settle down and breed a bunch of little werevamps and live happily ever after, so that leaves Bella and Edward facing empty nest syndrome for eternity with nothing ahead of them but the same ole same ole day in and day out and sooner or later probably boring each other into a coma.  Doesn't sound like much to look forward to.So it's finally, finally, finally over.  No more sparkly vampires.  And please, Stephenie Meyer, no more godawful books to turn into godawful movies.

This one has the best action moments despite the unexpected plot twist, the best pacing that it doesn't waste too much staying at place for a long period unlike the last picture that was slow even its nearly two hours, the humor is more funny than ever, at least Kristen Stewart as Bella Cullen gets something to do more this time around now that's she is in full vampire mode that she has powers, the postcard ending before the closing credits with the whole entire cast from all five films thanking the fans despite how much people like or dislike them. I have seen this one five times actually three times buying a ticket each week and the two times theater hoping, the first time seeing it which me and my best friend went to see it which then we sneaked into Rise of the Guardians, the next week, we bought another ticket, then we theater sneaked into the film immediately that showing ended which I fell somehow, asleep, then the next week, we bought one last ticket and we were the only two people in the theater and I fell asleep then we sneaked into the next showing which even I'm a guy that can withstand 4 other screenings with my friend who is a woman. But, if guys are reading this, you all would say if you can withstand Twilight, wooooooooooow, you've risked seeing it five times or the haters, you would say, the poor woman tortured the poor guy by seeing it five times but, it was nothing like that at all, so suck it up and I'm just a fellow moviegoer and just having fun with my friend that just thinks this whole series could have been worst but happy and sad at the same time that this movie series is over until the reboot which it had only had some material cut out of the film not going to be on the DVD or blu-ray special features that was in the book and or created for the film which many fans know that they were filmed that was deleted.

To be sure, this movie, like all the others, has many problems.

The special effects in these films have ranged from great to downright campy (the wolf transformations have always been pretty comic-book to me.) But this film has the best material to work with, in terms of Bella FINALLY being a vampire, FINALLY being married to Edward, and having a beautiful daughter to boot. The climax with the Volturi is very well-done, by far the best scene on all levels done in any of these movies. It has a real epic (and not at all campy) feel to it when the 2 forces come towards each other (won't share much more so I don't spoil it.)

The movie is very dramatic, explores deep interesting themes, like all of the twilight movies. In this one, the fight scene is particularly impressive. It poses a question - is it really worth fighting, or better resolve issues politically? Because - are you willing to pay the price? Yes, you would destroy the &#34;bad guys&#34;, but are you ready to lose some of your own? And at the same time, how it is important to stand your ground and defend your principles and your way of living. Also, what being together as a couple means (again), how it is importand to always stay together, no matter what. Example - &#34;spoilers&#34; - Bella and Edward run to attack Aro. Aro gives Bella a kick, and she flies high trough the air. Edward, because he cares more for her than to give another kick to Aro, is all about catching her first.

First, few white couples surrounded the main characters, followed by a couple of African girls, then a couple of French guys, then a couple of Indian Americans, all coming and going for on intelligent explanation.The clips of wolves appeared totally out of place, like the work of young school kids movie production.The end of the movie brought regret on the time and money wasted on a boring movie.Mohamed F.

After seeing all those that came before, let's face it, I just wasn't interested.  I was a bit curious about this whole idea of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) ""imprinting"" Renesmee (CGI, then Mackenzie Foy), the child of Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) as Part 1 closed.  Although I'm not sure about exactly what ""imprinting"" entails, I was thinking that this fast growing child of a vampire and a human would soon catch up to Jacob, age wise.  Now that would be interesting.  Alas, it wasn't.  Nor was anything else.The film is chock full of lame dialog.  So much so, I don't know how the actors - most of which are excellent in other work - kept a straight face.  Others will have to decide whether this is the screenwriter or the original author's fault.  From a technical viewpoint, this isn't very good either.  Let's start with baby Renesmee.  We first see her as a CGI created baby that is, well, ugly.  Not to mention the fact that the use is very primitive.  Then we have the Bella and Edward hopping around the Washington mountains and valleys looking for blood.  This is so badly produced that it's laughable.  As usual, the movie has a fine soundtrack and some nice sets.  All of the houses are to die for, and I guess the characters did.

The soundtrack was  truly splendid (shout out to Paul McDonald who has a track on there with his wife Nikki, who played Rosalie in the series.  Loved him on his American Idol  season).I rarely listen to film commentary, but I did this time and found that there were nuances I had missed while watching the movie, that enhanced the whole experience for me.

1617717,A3KM9UA6MAVURN,B00AW0KHTM,"pjf ""pjf""","[0, 0]","ProsLoved the end credits with the book pages/introducing the major cast credits from all the 4 movies. Very touching and a tribute to the books. And pertinent in that this was a series of movie adaptations that, due to fan pressure, really had to stick to the books. In fact the five minutes of the end/credits sung to ""thousand days"" was perfect and almost worth watching the whole movie for.Love the battle scene, a great twist improvement.  I found it quite shocking.Love the CGI wolves.The cinematography of the NW scenery was beautifully done.  Titles and credits were great.Billy Burke great as always. He did a fantastic job through the series as Bella's dad.Sets, interiors of the Carlisle mansion looked great.  Just what intellectual, artsy vampires would collect around them.ConsThe sappy dialogue at the beginning (first twenty minutes) was almost too much to bear. Sorry.Bella's ""sheild"" was poorly displayed in the end scene. Very hard to tell that it was there or working, or what her motivations were - for example as she pulled it back from Edward, etc. Unless you understood what she was doing based on the book, but the movie should be able to explain this, since it was a key plot point.The battle scene -- good grief, the writer should have had them go into that scenario with some battle tactics planned. Given Bella was the sheild and also the newborn and thus the strongest, why wasn't she doing either effectively?  Why didn't they plan to take out Jane and her brother first, and then Aro.  Why wasn't Bella shielding and going after Jane?  And why would Jane run from Alice?  Jane could immobilize her, and the wolf that got Jane as well.  The whole battle scene looked like it was written by someone who had no idea of strategy. Jasper and Carlisle would have been better prepared in case it came to that. And as the strongest, Bella should have put in a better show.I didn't hate the CGI baby as much as some, but I didn't like it.soundtrack was really bad. No new catchy songs. No new love songs. In general these are not great soundtracks, and the first movie, I think was the best. Also, I miss the old days of film, when each major character in a movie had a ""theme"", a few bars of which played briefly when they appeared (at times). Seems to me this series cried out for a theme for Edward, Carlisle and Esme, etc.The makeup on the Carlisle family vampires has been so bad since the first movie. They are supposed to look attractive. Most of them just look really bad and all the extra budget has not improved this - the shoestring budget first movie got it done better. Here Carlisle's white face looked bloated, Esme's hair was MUCH more attractive when it was caramelas the books specify, not dark as in the last few films.  Emmet too looked odd. Jasper was okay, but Rose definitely did not look spectacular as her book character specified.Since Bella had so little trouble controlling herself around JAcob and Ness, all the worry over her meeting Charlie seemed unreal.Also, Bella didn't really look that different to me, as a vampire as she did during her wedding, when she was made up, etc. So Charlie's ""you're my daughter and not my daughter"" didn't fly.It would have been nice, given this was the last movie, to have some more defined ending for the relationship between Cullens and the wolfpacks.  A sort of wrap up.  They just wandered off.Dings at the book, that it is not fair to ding the movie for, since it has to be faithful, but still.Why is Carlisle the only one that seems to do something productive with his days?Bella is still a very unlikable character. The only nice thing she really does in the whole series is to move to Forks to benefit her mother. And take over the cooking/housekeeping for Charlie. In the beginning of the first book, I liked her for that. But the rest of the series, she  too often has seemed a whining, complaining, ungrateful brat, and a user of too many people (Jacob particularly comes to mind).I don't really understand the whole vampire attraction thing.  Even sparkly vegetarian ones. And Bella's constant worry that she'll be a day older than Edward seems really shallow.But kudoes to Meyer for tapping into a teen theme, and making a success of it.",3,pros and cons,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,4239,"['ProsLoved', 'end', 'book', 'pages/introducing', 'major', 'cast', 'credits', '4', 'movies', 'Very', 'touching', 'tribute', 'books', 'pertinent', 'was', 'series', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'due', 'fan', 'pressure', 'really', 'had', 'stick', 'books', 'fact', 'five', 'minutes', 'end/credits', 'sung', 'thousand', 'days', 'was', 'perfect', 'almost', 'worth', 'watching', 'whole', 'movie', 'for.Love', 'battle', 'scene', 'great', 'twist', 'improvement', 'found', 'quite', 'shocking.Love', 'CGI', 'wolves.The', 'cinematography', 'NW', 'scenery', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Titles', 'credits', 'were', 'great.Billy', 'Burke', 'great', 'always', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'series', 'Bella', 'dad.Sets', 'interiors', 'Carlisle', 'mansion', 'looked', 'great', 'Just', 'what', 'intellectual', 'artsy', 'vampires', 'would', 'collect', 'them.ConsThe', 'sappy', 'dialogue', 'beginning', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'Sorry.Bella', 'sheild', 'was', 'poorly', 'displayed', 'end', 'scene', 'Very', 'hard', 'tell', 'was', 'there', 'working', 'what', 'motivations', 'were', 'example', 'pulled', 'back', 'Edward', 'etc', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'based', 'book', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'explain', 'was', 'key', 'plot', 'point.The', 'battle', 'scene', 'good', 'grief', 'writer', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'go', 'scenario', 'battle', 'tactics', 'planned', 'Given', 'Bella', 'was', 'sheild', 'also', 'newborn', 'thus', 'strongest', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'effectively', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'take', 'out', 'Jane', 'brother', 'first', 'then', 'Aro', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'Bella', 'shielding', 'going', 'Jane', 'why', 'would', 'Jane', 'run', 'Alice', 'Jane', 'could', 'immobilize', 'wolf', 'got', 'Jane', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'battle', 'scene', 'looked', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'idea', 'strategy', 'Jasper', 'Carlisle', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'prepared', 'case', 'came', 'strongest', 'Bella', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'better', 'show.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'CGI', 'baby', 'as', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.soundtrack', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'new', 'catchy', 'songs', 'new', 'love', 'songs', 'general', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'soundtracks', 'first', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'Also', 'miss', 'old', 'days', 'film', 'when', 'major', 'character', 'movie', 'had', 'theme', 'few', 'bars', 'played', 'briefly', 'when', 'appeared', 'times', 'Seems', 'series', 'cried', 'out', 'theme', 'Edward', 'Carlisle', 'Esme', 'makeup', 'Carlisle', 'family', 'vampires', 'been', 'so', 'bad', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'supposed', 'look', 'attractive', 'Most', 'just', 'look', 'really', 'bad', 'extra', 'budget', 'not', 'improved', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'first', 'movie', 'got', 'done', 'better', 'Here', 'Carlisle', 'white', 'face', 'looked', 'bloated', 'Esme', 'hair', 'was', 'MUCH', 'more', 'attractive', 'when', 'was', 'caramelas', 'books', 'specify', 'not', 'dark', 'last', 'few', 'films', 'Emmet', 'too', 'looked', 'odd', 'Jasper', 'was', 'okay', 'Rose', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'spectacular', 'book', 'character', 'specified.Since', 'Bella', 'had', 'so', 'little', 'trouble', 'controlling', 'JAcob', 'Ness', 'worry', 'meeting', 'Charlie', 'seemed', 'unreal.Also', 'Bella', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'different', 'vampire', 'did', 'wedding', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'etc', 'So', 'Charlie', ""'re"", 'daughter', 'not', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'fly.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'given', 'was', 'last', 'movie', 'have', 'more', 'defined', 'ending', 'relationship', 'Cullens', 'wolfpacks', 'sort', 'wrap', 'up', 'just', 'wandered', 'off.Dings', 'book', 'not', 'fair', 'ding', 'movie', 'be', 'faithful', 'still.Why', 'Carlisle', 'only', 'one', 'do', 'something', 'productive', 'days', 'Bella', 'still', 'very', 'unlikable', 'character', 'only', 'nice', 'thing', 'really', 'whole', 'series', 'move', 'Forks', 'benefit', 'mother', 'take', 'over', 'cooking/housekeeping', 'Charlie', 'beginning', 'first', 'book', 'liked', 'rest', 'series', 'too', 'often', 'seemed', 'whining', 'complaining', 'ungrateful', 'brat', 'user', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'Jacob', 'particularly', 'mind', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'whole', 'vampire', 'attraction', 'thing', 'Even', 'sparkly', 'vegetarian', 'ones', 'Bella', 'constant', 'worry', ""'ll"", 'be', 'day', 'older', 'Edward', 'really', 'shallow.But', 'kudoes', 'Meyer', 'tapping', 'teen', 'theme', 'making', 'success']",N/A

He is not as into the saga as I am, he just goes with because I make him.  He enjoyed the crowd more than the movie.  He laughed at the crowd's reaction to Alice's vision. He said you could hear everyone sigh with relief.  I think this movie was great.  It always kept you on your toes, never knowing what to expect next.  After seeing this video in theaters I was extremely confused.  I loved how the movie took you off course, but I had a hard time keeping track of who was killed.  I was almost in tears seeing everyone get killed.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This is one where I could watch it over and over and never get sick of it.

1617730,AVL5IDEE8YA3D,B00AW0KHTM,Rachel McElhany,"[3, 6]","Breaking Dawn - Part 2 was a great ending to the Twilight series. The screenwriter did a great job of trimming down the last half of the book into a concise and action packed movie. Thankfully, there are no cheesy wolf talking scenes like in the first Breaking Dawn. However, I was not a fan of baby Renesmee. The director digitally imposed actress Mackenzie Foy's face onto all the younger versions of Renesmee. The result was unrealistic and creepy, especially when Renesmee is still the size of an infant. I think just using a real baby's face would have been fine.This movie introduces several new vampires that come to help the Cullens confront the Volturi. The casting of these new vampires was superb. They all looked just like I would have expected from their descriptions in the book. Seeing how beautiful the female Denali vampires are just underscored in my mind how miscast Nikki Reed is as Rosalie. Since Rosalie is supposed to be one of the most beautiful vampires ever, she should look like these women. Something is especially wrong about Rosalie's hair in this movie - I'm pretty sure it's a wig and it's really bad. I think a natural blonde should have been cast as Rosalie from the beginning.You may have heard there is a twist in the movie that is not in the book. It's true and it took my breath away. I've heard that purists who are not happy with the twist have been walking out before the movie ends. STAY!

1617737,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B00AW0KHTM,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[7, 10]","If one had to describe one word about Twilight the Saga:  Breaking Dawn Part Two, unpredictable.  For fans that have followed the previous installments of the Twilight film series and the never-ending romance between Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), changes have taken place since Part One of Breaking Dawn.  Edward and Bella married and conceived an addition to the Cullen vampire clan, daughter Renesmee (Mckenzie Foy), and there is no longer tensions between Edward and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who has become godparent to Renesmee; there are light-hearted moments throughout the film, especially Bella not taking a liking to Jacob calling Renesmee by the nickname of ""Nessie,"" which Bella somewhat snidely comments its relation to the Lochness Monster.  Aside, from the tongue-in-cheekiness, the premise of the storyline continues with the quest of the main characters to defeat evil so that good will prevail.  And now having Nessie as a part of the picture, things become a bit delicate within the vampire order when word reaches to the Volturi thousands of miles away of Nessie's place in the Cullen clan.Breaking Dawn Part Two contains a series of surprising moments that viewers may not have expected.  A few of the characters that may have had subtle moments or parts in past installments will indeed share the spotlight with Edward, Bella, and Jacob.  One of the most notable is Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene), whom possessed the ability and power to predict the future, and by the conclusion of the film, the most eye-popping moments flash before viewers' eyes; the scenes are amazingly done and much credit to the screenwriters and Director Bill Condon and of course, the cinematographers.  But other observable moments are the addition to other characters within the vampire order, which provides a somewhat international flare to the storyline.  Vampire patriarch Carlisle Cullen bands together cohorts to attempt to defeat the Volturi, and they are a mix of so-called ""Hall of Nations"" of vampires that have had their share of war stories.  For example, Garrett (Lee Pace) who had fought during the Battle at Yorktown and the Revolutionary War and sarcastically comments of having gone through the first and second British invasions and did not quite like the Beatles, two Amazonian women, Vladimir (Noel Fisher) and Stefan (Guri Weinberg) trailblazers within the Romanian terrain, and several other vampire nomads.  Without revealing so much of the climax of the film, there are moments that suggest the premise beyond good versus evil that stretches to the point in this film of survival of the fittest within the vampire hierarchy of immortality versus the mortal world.  The Native American figures that are presented near end of the film show the symbolism and ironic undertones.The film appears to be the end of the Twilight series of films.  By the end of the last scene, Christina Perri's ""A Thousand Years"" plays and accompanies a montage of close-ups of Edward and Bella from the previous films, and thereafter, the film credits roll and the names and faces of the entire cast of this film and the previous three films; For diehard Twilight fans, the credits appear to be a farewell address.  And may this be the conclusion to the Twilight series?  With the last concluding scene, the possibilities loom in the balance.",5,"""Break on through to the other side""",1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,3375,"['one', 'had', 'describe', 'one', 'word', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', 'Two', 'unpredictable', 'fans', 'have', 'followed', 'previous', 'installments', 'Twilight', 'film', 'series', 'never-ending', 'romance', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'changes', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'Part', 'One', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'married', 'conceived', 'addition', 'Cullen', 'vampire', 'clan', 'daughter', 'Renesmee', 'Mckenzie', 'Foy', 'longer', 'tensions', 'Edward', 'Jacob', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'who', 'become', 'godparent', 'Renesmee', 'are', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'film', 'especially', 'Bella', 'not', 'taking', 'liking', 'Jacob', 'calling', 'Renesmee', 'nickname', 'Nessie', 'Bella', 'somewhat', 'snidely', 'comments', 'relation', 'Lochness', 'Monster', 'Aside', 'tongue-in-cheekiness', 'premise', 'storyline', 'quest', 'main', 'characters', 'defeat', 'evil', 'good', 'will', 'prevail', 'now', 'having', 'Nessie', 'part', 'picture', 'things', 'become', 'bit', 'delicate', 'vampire', 'order', 'when', 'word', 'Volturi', 'thousands', 'miles', 'away', 'Nessie', 'place', 'Cullen', 'clan.Breaking', 'Dawn', 'Part', 'Two', 'series', 'surprising', 'moments', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'expected', 'few', 'characters', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'subtle', 'moments', 'parts', 'past', 'installments', 'will', 'indeed', 'share', 'spotlight', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'Jacob', 'One', 'most', 'notable', 'Alice', 'Cullen', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'whom', 'possessed', 'ability', 'power', 'predict', 'future', 'conclusion', 'film', 'most', 'eye-popping', 'moments', 'flash', 'viewers', 'eyes', 'scenes', 'are', 'amazingly', 'done', 'much', 'credit', 'screenwriters', 'Director', 'Bill', 'Condon', 'course', 'cinematographers', 'other', 'observable', 'moments', 'are', 'addition', 'other', 'characters', 'vampire', 'order', 'somewhat', 'international', 'flare', 'storyline', 'Vampire', 'patriarch', 'Carlisle', 'Cullen', 'together', 'cohorts', 'attempt', 'defeat', 'Volturi', 'are', 'mix', 'so-called', 'Hall', 'Nations', 'vampires', 'have', 'had', 'share', 'war', 'stories', 'example', 'Garrett', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'who', 'had', 'fought', 'Battle', 'Yorktown', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'sarcastically', 'comments', 'having', 'gone', 'first', 'second', 'British', 'invasions', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'Beatles', 'two', 'Amazonian', 'women', 'Vladimir', 'Noel', 'Fisher', 'Stefan', 'Guri', 'Weinberg', 'trailblazers', 'Romanian', 'terrain', 'several', 'other', 'vampire', 'nomads', 'revealing', 'so', 'much', 'climax', 'film', 'are', 'moments', 'suggest', 'premise', 'good', 'versus', 'stretches', 'point', 'film', 'survival', 'fittest', 'vampire', 'hierarchy', 'immortality', 'mortal', 'world', 'Native', 'American', 'figures', 'are', 'presented', 'end', 'film', 'show', 'symbolism', 'ironic', 'undertones.The', 'film', 'be', 'end', 'Twilight', 'series', 'films', 'end', 'last', 'scene', 'Christina', 'Perri', 'A', 'Thousand', 'Years', 'plays', 'montage', 'close-ups', 'Edward', 'Bella', 'previous', 'films', 'thereafter', 'film', 'credits', 'roll', 'names', 'entire', 'cast', 'film', 'previous', 'three', 'films', 'diehard', 'Twilight', 'fans', 'credits', 'appear', 'be', 'farewell', 'address', 'may', 'be', 'conclusion', 'Twilight', 'series', 'last', 'concluding', 'scene', 'possibilities', 'loom', 'balance']",N/A

I thought the sex scene was a bit too much for parents with kids. However, this particular movie was very well made. Stunning cinematography and sound.  The acting was spot on A-list level. Props, sets, lighting, make-up, to include low and high-end CGI effects were stunning and sharp. A very romantic story, with lots of fighting and hard hitting action. They finally made some attempts to increase the gore factor in this movie, but still not enough if any blood or blood sprays...I don't understand that, yet they will show sex scenes. I also wish they made the werewolves look like real traditional werewolves rather than some over grown dog! Overall, the movie was impressive for once. Glad it's finally over... I hope. I gave it (4) stars because in any werewolf or vampire movie there should always be lots of blood. There was hardly a drop in this movie even when heads are being ripped off bodies! At least give me some blood sprays when the heads are ripped off ...right? So because of that I will (ding) them, and give them only (4) stars.

First let me say i got suckered into Renting the first twilight movie and yes i thought it was a little silly but the story line hooked me, So i continued watching these movies with my wife. (P.S. IM 37)  WITH THAT SAID, Breaking Dawn part two was a very good movie, i admit that i thought it got a little dry in the middle while they were looking for there witnesses and the fact that Bella was so controlled as a newborn seemed kinda fake,  I wish they would have made it longer and got more into the back stories of the new characters more.  Honestly i think my favorite part of this last movie though is the extra's the making of the movie, Its a real treat !  Im disapointed that this is where the story has stopped, i want to see how things go on with bella. Obviously they cant stay in Forks very long as people would not understand why the family including bella are not aging, Id like to see How things play out with Jacob and Renesme, i think another story or even a few more stories are in order to help us along.  if the Fast and the Furious can come back with a 6th movie why cant Twilight :) ?  Oh obviously Aro would be intrested in Alice and Bella's Skills.. this would be another excellent plot point.. or what about Charlie figuring out whats happend to Bella aand the Vult finding out and then there after bella for being exposed ??  I can think of alot of ways this saga could continue and go on..  There's been enuff money made that surely they can see the fans want more..  I think they would be foolish to stop here.Breaking dawn part 2 wrapped things up pretty nice for now, i have enjoyed these movies and am glad i got suckered into watching the first one.

Obviously, every Twilight movie up until now has been horrendous, in large part because they're based on, you know, the Twilight books.

And yet . . . somehow this movie is even worse.  Maybe it's the creepy, computer-generated baby they use (apparently because no baby could ever be as cute as they wanted Renesme to look?); maybe it's the fact that a good 90% of the dialogue is spoken over dramatic music (apparently to hide the fact that they're not saying anything interesting); maybe it's the fact that the storyline is so halting and confused that it almost feels like a series of vignettes, especially with all the ridiculous flashbacks and flash-forwards; or maybe it's just, you know, these things and a million other horrible things.  I admit, my friends and I actually wondered aloud at several times whether the filmmakers had realized that these movies are sooooo bad and that such a large percentage of the audience is made up of people who are just there to make fun of it--and whether they had just decided that they would go ALL OUT and give us lots of material to work with.",1,Horrible even by Twilight standards,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,1633,"['Wow', 'Where', 'begin', 'Obviously', 'Twilight', 'movie', 'up', 'now', 'been', 'horrendous', 'large', 'part', ""'re"", 'based', 'know', 'Twilight', 'books', 'Horrible', 'writing', 'horrible', 'messages', 'boyfriend', 'should', 'get', 'depressed', 'then', 'try', 'kill', 'bring', 'back', 'so', 'romantic', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'super', 'controlling', 'life', 'also', 'SO', 'romantic', 'when', 'morning', 'wedding', 'night', 'wake', 'up', 'covered', 'bruises', 'boyfriend-turned-husband', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'control', 'how', 'attracted', 'resulting', 'actual', 'physical', 'damages', 'etc', 'horrible', 'cinematography', 'are', 'par', 'course', 'series', 'yet', 'somehow', 'movie', 'even', 'worse', 'Maybe', 'creepy', 'computer-generated', 'baby', 'use', 'apparently', 'baby', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'as', 'cute', 'wanted', 'Renesme', 'look', 'fact', 'good', '90', '%', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'dramatic', 'music', 'apparently', 'hide', 'fact', ""'re"", 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'interesting', 'fact', 'storyline', 'so', 'halting', 'confused', 'almost', 'feels', 'series', 'vignettes', 'especially', 'ridiculous', 'flashbacks', 'flash-forwards', 'maybe', 'just', 'know', 'things', 'million', 'other', 'horrible', 'things', 'admit', 'friends', 'actually', 'wondered', 'aloud', 'several', 'times', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'realized', 'movies', 'are', 'sooooo', 'bad', 'large', 'percentage', 'audience', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'make', 'fun', 'had', 'just', 'decided', 'would', 'go', 'OUT', 'give', 'lots', 'material', 'work']",N/A

Most of the actors were beautiful, all were attractive, but for me, not knowing what came before, I couldn't understand why the characters behaved the way they did, so not really a stand-alone viewable film in my opinion.  I saw the first film, and I think I read the first book in the series, and one of my sisters loves this series and I believe told me parts of some of the other books but I've either forgotten or just never knew enough of the series to follow this film conclusion.  Bella seems to be saying in this story that though she is not human, she doesn't deem her new life as a vampire in a negative light, but I don't know enough of the series story to understand how the change impacts her quality of life.

1617838,AQJSMLYHE6GN4,B00AW0KHTM,"StarReviewer ""SR""","[8, 12]","`Breaking Dawn Part 2' was a great end to the `Twilight` movies. If you haven't read the book, be warned, there are BIG spoilers starting now. When I read the book, one of my favorite scenes was the `You imprinted on my baby/named my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?!' scene. That and, as far as I could tell, all of the most memorable scenes from the book were presented wonderfully. Bella's transformation to a vampire - and her first hunt with Edward - are beautiful and eerie. The different vampires who come to support the Cullen family were so cool! But I'll shut up about that and let you enjoy everything yourself! (I have to add that the actors were all at the top of their game!). But now for the warning. `Breaking Dawn Part 2' is much more violent than the other `Twilight' movies. There are a few disturbing scenes (one as a flashback) and then there is the battle at the end. Had I not been warned, I would have been horrified. BIG SPOILER: there is a battle between the Volturi and the Cullen allies. Many of the main characters are brutally killed, people (good and bad) have their heads ripped off and the heads are shown close-up. But, this turns out to only be a vision of the future which Alice shows Aro, and so the movie ends the same way the book does. It's a pretty amazing battle scene. But as the Twilight movies have been very mild thus far, the violence was rather startling. In conclusion, a great movie, with excitement, romance, horrible deaths (most of which aren't real) and great vampires from around the globe.

1617880,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00AW0KHTM,The People's Critic,"[10, 15]","We may be edging near the saturation point of vampire-related entertainment, however, as brooding, Washington-state-based, vampire/werewolf romance films go, Breaking Dawn: Part 2 easily ranks in the top five.  Twi-Hards have been waiting over four years to finally see how the cinematic adaptation of the Stephenie Meyer series of books will end.  All things considered, the end result is actually rather exciting.Breaking Dawn: Part 1 left us staring into the (red) eyes of Bella post-pregnancy and post-transformation.  Part 2 begins at this same moment as Bella adapts to her new vampiric life-style and her new role as mother to the half-human, half-vampire child, Renesmee.  Now if you haven't managed to suspend your disbelief at this point, leave the theater; I'm sure Lincoln is playing right next door.  Regardless, as Renesmee rapidly grows, the Cullen clan finds themselves in new territory, raising a natural newborn.  Furthermore, word spreads to the Volturi that such a unique child exists and that it might be immortal, and therefore, illegal.  This looming inevitability of a final showdown between the Cullens and Volturi drives the plot unlike any of this film's predecessors, and as climaxes go, this one is by far the best.In spite of this, there is certainly no shortage of excessive melodrama or corny moments of tepid dialogue.  While Stewart and Pattinson have reached an iconic status as leads Bella and Edward, they continue to fail to deliver powerful performances in these roles.  Throughout the series, both leads seem too comfortable resting on the idea that these characters do nothing but whisper, stare, and have sex.  If you buy Kristin Stewart as a caring mother in this film, I have the actual bowie knife that killed Dracula to sell you.  Taylor Lautner holds his own as Jacob, who's scene with Bella's father Charlie Swan (Billy Burke) steals the movie.  Nonetheless, no one goes to see this series of films to be wowed by the range of its actors.  In fact, this film introduces so many characters that none of them have much time to shine (sparkly or otherwise).  What these characters do bring is a host of new X-Men-style super powers, which are enjoyable elements to the film.  Thus, the film delivers in other ways.  Its pacing is strong as it does not dwell on any one moment in its journey to the final showdown.  Additionally, its action is crisp and deliberate; there is very little to distract from the story's momentum.  The cast does their job, but these successes are the result of writers Melissa Rosenberg and Stephenie Meyer along with director, Bill Condon.The vampire craze that started all of this may be starting to show some signs of declining slightly, yet this is a fairly strong send-off to an epically successful series of adolescent-aimed pop culture.  It is clearly the best of the series, which adds a significance to all five of the films.  The closing credits illustrate this as they celebrate the entire cast of the films together.  Pop culture vampires may be in their eclipse rather than beginning their new moon, but Twilight certainly lived to see the break of dawn.

But be patient with the film's ruefully uneven first half, where we meet the new Bella Swan, fully transformed, capable of running and jumping like a Marvel Comics character. Effects are pretty cheesy at times, and Bella develops her prowess as a vampire too quickly, but at least she is not dull some campy moments during her ""training"" as a vampire.Still, not many things happen to advance the story. Characters are often standing and delivering lines to each other. Jacob is taking off his shirt again (done with some self-awareness) and you know that's a staple of the series. Please wait for a Volturi leader Aro, played by scenery-chewing Michael Sheen, shows up with an evil smile on his face.Now that Edward and Bella are married and their baby Renesmee is born, what we want to know is, ""Who survives?"" ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" answers the question in a surprisingly violent way. The over-the-top combat sequence includes decapitations, though they are done in a not-so-graphic fashion that is made intentionally to look cartoonish.Probably this is the least romantic ""Twilight"" installment, and the final chapter attempts to satisfy both those who want to see blood spilled, and those who don't.

In Breaking Dawn, I admit, I was so disappointed that more wasn't done when the entire Volturi entourage head all the way across the ocean from Italy to Washington state to confront the Cullens about an immortal child and the Cullens talk their way out of it yet again.  LolNot a very earth shattering climax and like me, left the reader wanting more.  Throw a punch for cryin' out loud.  Blah!Sorry Stephenie, but Summit Entertainment was right on the money adding this scene.  Like me in the theater, when it got to the part of realizing that Aro was only being shown a ""this could be you"" scene if he chose this path, I gasped liked the rest of the audience and Summit knew we all would do that and therefore, this move was extremely successful.I think each installment had it's moments, but like many many other reviews, the first movie and then this one, the last, were the best.No.  Not everyone has to like it and there have been so many insults hurled at this saga but whatever....It was nice watching Kristen grow up through the movie.  Her acting improved somewhat and when they show her in a montage scene at the end, she really had a baby face in the first Twilight and you don't realize that she matured and seemed older until you see different clips from each movie.She grew up right in front of our eyes.I would love a continuation of the series going in the direction of Jacob and Renessmee.  In the books, the Cullens would still be a part of the story of course, but I don't know how they'd do a movie because the vamps don't age and Jacob and Nessie do naturally.If I were Meyer and raking in all the glory from all of this, I'd be writing a surprise continuation of Twilight.Like I have said on a few other reviews of this saga, I have always given high praise and credit to Michael Sheen for stealing all the scenes he's in.  He and the other two of his Volturi buddies do a great job of creeping you out.  Marcus, (Christopher Heyerdahl) does that slow turn with his head and he does this strange long exaggerated sigh that works perfectly for him.  He has the smallest role, yet manages to freak a person out because he's that good.Jamie Bower's deal was that wonderful sinister look he'd give with that very slight curve of a smile (Caius).  All three of them took the small amount of screen time they had and made it fantastic.I had always always wished the Volturi had a bigger part in the entire story.",5,Yay!!!,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,2512,"['REALLY', 'needed', 'include', 'extra', 'fight', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'book', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'admit', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'more', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'when', 'entire', 'Volturi', 'entourage', 'head', 'way', 'ocean', 'Italy', 'Washington', 'state', 'confront', 'Cullens', 'immortal', 'child', 'Cullens', 'talk', 'way', 'yet', 'again', 'LolNot', 'very', 'earth', 'shattering', 'climax', 'left', 'reader', 'wanting', 'more', 'Throw', 'punch', 'cryin', 'out', 'loud', 'Blah', 'Sorry', 'Stephenie', 'Summit', 'Entertainment', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'adding', 'scene', 'theater', 'when', 'got', 'part', 'realizing', 'Aro', 'was', 'only', 'being', 'shown', 'could', 'be', 'scene', 'chose', 'path', 'gasped', 'liked', 'rest', 'audience', 'Summit', 'knew', 'would', 'do', 'therefore', 'move', 'was', 'extremely', 'successful.I', 'think', 'installment', 'had', 'moments', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'first', 'movie', 'then', 'one', 'last', 'were', 'best.No', 'Not', 'everyone', 'like', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'insults', 'hurled', 'saga', '.It', 'was', 'nice', 'watching', 'Kristen', 'grow', 'up', 'movie', 'acting', 'improved', 'somewhat', 'when', 'show', 'montage', 'scene', 'end', 'really', 'had', 'baby', 'face', 'first', 'Twilight', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'matured', 'seemed', 'older', 'see', 'different', 'clips', 'movie.She', 'grew', 'up', 'right', 'front', 'eyes.I', 'would', 'love', 'continuation', 'series', 'going', 'direction', 'Jacob', 'Renessmee', 'books', 'Cullens', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'part', 'story', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', ""'d"", 'do', 'movie', 'vamps', 'do', ""n't"", 'age', 'Jacob', 'Nessie', 'do', 'naturally.If', 'were', 'Meyer', 'raking', 'glory', ""'d"", 'be', 'writing', 'surprise', 'continuation', 'Twilight.Like', 'have', 'said', 'few', 'other', 'reviews', 'saga', 'have', 'always', 'given', 'high', 'praise', 'credit', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'stealing', 'scenes', 'other', 'two', 'Volturi', 'buddies', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'creeping', 'Marcus', 'Christopher', 'Heyerdahl', 'slow', 'turn', 'head', 'strange', 'long', 'exaggerated', 'sigh', 'perfectly', 'smallest', 'role', 'yet', 'freak', 'person', 'out', 'good.Jamie', 'Bower', 'deal', 'was', 'wonderful', 'sinister', 'look', ""'d"", 'give', 'very', 'slight', 'curve', 'smile', 'Caius', 'three', 'took', 'small', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'had', 'made', 'fantastic.I', 'had', 'always', 'always', 'wished', 'Volturi', 'had', 'bigger', 'part', 'entire', 'story']",N/A
