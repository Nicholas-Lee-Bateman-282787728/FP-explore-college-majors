But when he emerges from the bathroom, his wife doesn't seem to notice. Nor do his co-workers or friends. He never had a mustache, they say. The man starts to go crazy. Parts of his life seem to be disappearing. He's caught in an alternative reality -- a different version of himself. He questions everything. Finally, when he overhears his wife talking about having him committed, he runs away -- to Hong Kong.For long stretches of this movie, I was quite riveted It seemed to owe something to Kafka. Without anything scary happening, a mood of unease, even menace builds. The idea that the basic building blocks of a person's life can be so easily undermined is disturbing. The movie seemed to have something important to say. But the plot loses its way in the Hong Kong scenes and the end is a way too facile. Ultimately, we get no explanation of how and why -- everything is rather too easily resolved.

1028558,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000JLTS3K,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[6, 10]","The premise is so simple that it is hard not to find it attractive. A man shaves off his mustache only to find that nobody in his life believes that he ever had one. He goes through the natural paces; thinks it is a joke, thinks it is a conspiracy, thinks the whole world has gone mad. Director Emmanuel Carrere makes an interesting choice early on by showing us the shaving of the mustache so that throughout we side with Marc (Vincent Lindon) and think that he is the normal one. I assume that he did that so we would surrender to the Marc vs. The World storyline that he was going with. At its core I feel as though Carrere is trying to say something about the nature of relationships, about how the smallest things can collapse a seemingly happy love affair. Marc and his wife Agnes (Emmanuelle Devos) seem to have a perfectly nice thing going, but subtract the mustache from the equation and suddenly the entire house of cards come crashing down. And most importantly it is a good time, so even though Carrere plays dirty pool along the way and even though the plot becomes a jumbled mess at the end I still recommend you to go check out this film.The thrust of the story is a variation on the Wrong Man device. It doesn't take place in our logic based world. By shaving his mustache he sets himself back, time wise or otherwise, to a place where his dad is still alive and he has yet to quit smoking. Plus everybody in his life refuses to admit that he had a mustache that we the viewer clearly saw and the conspiracy is far too wide to have been man made. So he needs to prove to the world that he did have facial hair just as Richard Ian Blaney needed to prove that he wasn't the necktie murderer in ""Frenzy."" Lindon's performance also helps things along as not only does he look like the quintessential straight man but also nails the role and all of its nuances.In a very messed up third act Marc decides to head for the Far East (Hong Kong to be specific). We are never given a concrete reason, but given the fact that he is a stranger in his own life it is at least understandable. He becomes some sort of freak who spends his days riding around on a commuter boat. During all this my thumb kept tilting more and more downward but I could never come to the point of not liking this film. Then, in the style of David Lynch, his wife just shows up in his hotel room with no explanation given. The amount of sense being made spirals south until the end when he shaves off his mustache again and this time his wife notices. All of this backs up my theory that the theme is how little things can expose a greater rot in a relationship. I am a film viewer who will always take logic over illogic, but this is one of those rare films that left a smile on my face despite my state of perplexion. The first two thirds are considerably better than the last which looked like filler dressed up as high art. ""La Moustache"" felt quite polished for a French film and perhaps that is why it got such a lengthy run here in America. So unless you are scared off by subtitles or a little bit of confusion there really is no reason why you should not check this one out. ***1/4",3,"Sneaky, Creepy and at times Cheap",1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,3170,"['premise', 'so', 'simple', 'hard', 'not', 'find', 'attractive', 'man', 'mustache', 'only', 'find', 'nobody', 'life', 'ever', 'had', 'one', 'natural', 'paces', 'joke', 'conspiracy', 'whole', 'world', 'gone', 'mad', 'Director', 'Emmanuel', 'Carrere', 'interesting', 'choice', 'early', 'showing', 'shaving', 'mustache', 'side', 'Marc', 'Vincent', 'Lindon', 'think', 'normal', 'one', 'assume', 'did', 'would', 'surrender', 'Marc', 'vs', 'World', 'storyline', 'was', 'going', 'core', 'feel', 'Carrere', 'trying', 'say', 'something', 'nature', 'relationships', 'how', 'smallest', 'things', 'can', 'collapse', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'love', 'affair', 'Marc', 'wife', 'Agnes', 'Emmanuelle', 'Devos', 'seem', 'have', 'perfectly', 'nice', 'thing', 'going', 'subtract', 'mustache', 'equation', 'suddenly', 'entire', 'house', 'cards', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'most', 'importantly', 'good', 'time', 'so', 'even', 'Carrere', 'dirty', 'pool', 'way', 'even', 'plot', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'end', 'still', 'recommend', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'film.The', 'thrust', 'story', 'variation', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'device', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'logic', 'based', 'world', 'shaving', 'mustache', 'back', 'time', 'wise', 'otherwise', 'place', 'where', 'dad', 'still', 'alive', 'yet', 'quit', 'smoking', 'everybody', 'life', 'admit', 'had', 'mustache', 'viewer', 'clearly', 'saw', 'conspiracy', 'far', 'too', 'wide', 'have', 'been', 'man', 'made', 'prove', 'world', 'did', 'have', 'facial', 'hair', 'just', 'Richard', 'Ian', 'Blaney', 'needed', 'prove', 'was', ""n't"", 'necktie', 'murderer', 'Frenzy', 'Lindon', 'performance', 'also', 'things', 'along', 'not', 'only', 'look', 'quintessential', 'straight', 'man', 'also', 'role', 'nuances.In', 'very', 'messed', 'up', 'third', 'act', 'Marc', 'head', 'Far', 'East', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'be', 'specific', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'concrete', 'reason', 'given', 'fact', 'stranger', 'own', 'life', 'least', 'understandable', 'sort', 'freak', 'who', 'days', 'riding', 'around', 'commuter', 'boat', 'thumb', 'kept', 'tilting', 'more', 'more', 'downward', 'could', 'never', 'come', 'point', 'not', 'liking', 'film', 'Then', 'style', 'David', 'Lynch', 'wife', 'just', 'up', 'hotel', 'room', 'explanation', 'given', 'amount', 'sense', 'being', 'made', 'spirals', 'south', 'end', 'when', 'mustache', 'again', 'time', 'wife', 'notices', 'up', 'theory', 'theme', 'how', 'little', 'things', 'can', 'expose', 'greater', 'rot', 'relationship', 'am', 'film', 'viewer', 'who', 'will', 'always', 'take', 'logic', 'illogic', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'left', 'smile', 'face', 'state', 'perplexion', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'are', 'considerably', 'better', 'last', 'looked', 'filler', 'dressed', 'up', 'as', 'high', 'art', 'La', 'Moustache', 'felt', 'quite', 'polished', 'French', 'film', 'perhaps', 'why', 'got', 'such', 'lengthy', 'run', 'here', 'America', 'So', 'are', 'scared', 'off', 'subtitles', 'little', 'bit', 'confusion', 'really', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'check', 'one', 'out', '***1/4']",N/A

Was his wife sadistic?  Were all his friends in on some sadistic joke, too?The truth is hard to figure out because it's unclear if this story is being told in chronological order or not.  If not, then is the story moving backwards?  Are we seeing flashbacks?  Are we going in circles? That remains unanswered, so if you like tidy endings, this movie isn't for you.As far as the meaning behind this story, I thought this might be an artistic way of expressing unconditional love for someone.  When you love someone, it feels wonderful and warm...but it's also full of doubt because trust issues are involved.  Towards the end, Marc makes an important decision to leave evidence behind.  By doing so, was he making a decision to love Agnes anyway, despite his doubts?  But then, doubts never go completely away, do they?  Can you ever really know someone?But then I thought maybe this has to do with being overly dependent on someone.  In one scene, he writes to Agnes, ""Without your eyes, I see nothing.""  And so, maybe this is really about a person who stays in an unhealthy relationship because they can't let go.

Writer/director Emmanuel Carr&egrave;re (with co-script writer J&eacute;rme Beaujour) takes us on a mind trip that becomes increasingly disorienting and frustrating as the film progresses.  It challenges the audience to think but then there is no payoff for the effort.Marc (Vincent Lindon) is a handsome middle aged man married to Agn&egrave;s (Emmanuelle Devos) for fifteen years and one morning, in what in retrospect is in response to a bit of relationship ennui, decides to shave off his moustache which has always been present since his marriage began. The surprise to Marc is that Agn&egrave;s doesn't even notice. At work Marc quietly shows up and no one notices, not even his close associate Bruno (Hippolyte Girardot).  Marc is at first perplexed, then he confronts his wife and fellow workers with the fact that he just shaved off his moustache and no one believes that he ever had one!  Marc begins to search for photos showing his previous face and gradually the photos disappear and his wife denies ever seeing them, ever traveling to Bali where the photos were taken, etc.  People begin to wonder about Marc's sanity and his wife suggests he seek psychiatric care.  It is at this point that Marc enters a fugue state and ultimately disappears to Hong Kong on a never ending quest for discovering the truth about who he really is, whether he actually exists, whether he is the pawn in a cosmic game....it just gets more ludicrous.Both Vincent Lindon and Emmanuelle Devos are superb in these peculiar roles and the film has solid production values. Perhaps it is the director's point to leave the audience in a confused state, one that calls forth the existential questions, but as a film it merely peters out, leaving the viewer a bit frustrated by the lack of substance.

They go to their friends house for dinner that night and the man of the house, Serge, is Agnes' ex-boyfriend. He reminisces about a time that they went on a winter trip to a hotel with a weak heating system. One frigid night while all the guests were dining, Agnes turned off the heat in everyone else's room while turning it on full-blast to warm her own room. But she will never admit to doing it. As the days pass, nobody notices that Marc's moustache has been shaved and he thinks everyone is playing a joke on him. He is a sensitive man and his feelings are hurt, but later, he and AGnes begin to disagree on all kinds of things that Marc thinks happened, but Agnes does not remember. Is Marc going crazy?

You really feel a lot of empathy for Marc at this point; one day he has a really good life and the next day he has lost everything and is adrift in a foreign country where he does not even speak the langauge. He goes to a resort hotel away from the city and eventually Agnes shows up and suggests that they came to Hong Kong together for a vacation. Poor Marc is thoroughly confused, but certain evidence he has seen for himself suggest that Agnes is an evil beauty who is tired of her husband and wants to discard him. That is my theory, anyway.

It's exactly as the main character understands it to be at the very end.The movie starts out with Marc asking his wife, Agnes, if he should shave his mustache.  He does, and she doesn't notice. As a matter of fact, nobody notices.  When he confronts his wife and friends, they insist that he has not had a mustache for at least 15 years.  Obviously, somebody is either lying or going crazy.  He is suspicious of his wife and friends for quite a while, but then begins to believe that they are indeed telling the truth, and he is somewhat removed from reality.  Again, however, he starts distrusting his wife, since strangers recognize his mustache in older pictures.Who is telling the truth? Who is insane? The film begins with us clearly seeing Marc's mustache.  We also clearly see the hairs he trims, the hairs he washes away in the tub, and the hairs he washes away in his shaving tray. We watch him complete his entire shaving ritual-- first using shaving scissors, then an old-fashioned razor.  We see everything through Marc's eyes.  We meet his Serge and his wife. We hear Agnes talk about going to Marc's parents for lunch.  What is real and what isn't?Both Vincent Lindon and Emmanuelle Devos do a perfect job here. There isn't constant chatter or dialogue and nuances are delivered through subtle expression.  They are both so wonderful-- Lindon in particular.This movie is not about middle aged angst and it's not about a marriage falling apart nor is it about a man entering a 15 year time warp. It also is not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination-- although, like life, there might be some time you find yourself laughing a bit-- but it's due to the absurdity of the situation and the empathy the characters inspire.The music is gorgeous and the cinematography beautiful.  This is very much recommended.Note: The ending here is different from the book.  The book's ending is a stunner. When I was finished, I just sat there wide-eyed-- not believing what I just finished reading.  I re-read the last few pages because it was so unbelievably shocking.That ending definitely wouldn't have worked here. At the end of the film, I was almost praying I wouldn't have to see what I read in the book. It might have worked visually, but I doubted that it would. Carrere made the right choice here when deciding to change the ending.  Again, if you read the book, you wouldn't wonder at all who was right all along or if one of the characters were truly crazy.  There is no ambiguity in the book.  However, there's no ambiguity here, either.  It just hits you with a half a ton of bricks rather than a full ton.  And, that's not criticism-- a half ton still knocks you over. Just make sure you realize that the main character understands the truth at the end, and you will understand, too.",5,"Descent into madness?

Nervous breakdown? Is it a dream? It's hard to say. While I love things just enigmatic enough to be forced to think, I don't want to have to need Cliff Notes or have to watch the director's explanation in the extras section to understand what's going on in the end. As it turns out, the director did say that scenes that actually would have given the viewer even the slightest clue as to what is really happening were deleted. Huh? While this film is touted as a Hitchcock-esque mystery, I'm thinking more like Kafka. It had a certain surrealist quality about it that leaves you asking... a lot.Marc (Vincent Lindon) shaves his moustache, which he's had the whole 15 years he and his wife (Emmanuelle Devos) have been together. His wife, friends, and work colleagues don't mention that the moustache is gone and this upsets Marc. This is when the mystery starts. He starts to point it out and everyone thinks he's crazy saying he's never had a moustache. He then tries to find proof that he did have one, getting out pics of a trip with his wife, and asking a stranger to look at and older pic to confirm his rightness. While the stranger confirms the moustache, the wife denies any trip even happened. At this point, even though both he and his wife start to feel that he needs psychiatric help, he still feels that he is not off, but that maybe his wife is.As the film progresses, past and current reality starts blurring and becoming distorted and we see that his perception of reality keeps changing, and that both realities are happening at the same time. When things come to a head and he hears his wife and friend talking about committing him, he escapes to Hong Kong to find himself by--- taking the ferries back and forth all day? I guess that's a metaphor for the switching back and forth between realities? Whatever.This film is absolutely worth watching though for the brilliant performances of both Lindon and Devos. Lindon gives truly a haunting performance as the lost, confused, and angst riddled Marc. And Devos does the loving wife watching the descent of her husband into craziness perfectly. She has a quirky off beat way about her that fits with the ambience of this movie completely. Moreover, this film did keep me very intrigued and glued to the story until the end as I was wondering what's really going on. It does resemble Hitchcock somewhat in that we are wondering at some point if it's him going crazy or if he is being driven crazy by those around him.

Sherwin,"[2, 2]","La Moustache is an excellent film despite the fact that a lot of the story is open to interpretation--some of what we see is apparently fantasy and some is apparently reality; and the action is primarily seen through the eyes of Marc, a Frenchman living in Paris. This lack of clarity between fantasy and reality was somewhat frustrating; I admit it; but the film as a whole still works well--this will haunt me for quite some while to come. The acting was very convincing and the script was well written; I also think the choreography and the cinematography enhance the film even more. I also liked the musical score.When the movie begins, we meet Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon) and his wife Agn&egrave;s (Emmanuelle Devos) who have a happy marriage in Paris where Marc works at an agency that designs properties. One day on a whim, Marc asks Agnes if he should shave off his moustache; and Agnes replies that she ""wouldn't know (him) without it."" Marc shaves it off--and then his world begins to turn upside down very quickly.For one thing, Agn&egrave;s doesn't even notice that Marc's moustache is even missing--indeed, she insists that he never had one! Their friends and Marc's coworkers, including Bruno (Hippolyte Girardot), Serge (Mathieu Amalric) Samira (Cylia Malki) and Nadia (Macha Polikarpova) don't notice and join Agn&egrave;s in claiming that Marc never had a moustache, either! Slowly Marc begins to wonder if he's going insane--or are they playing a very cruel trick on him that needs to stop right away?The film has many other scenes that can be viewed as either reality or fantasy. Marc forgets the exact street address of his parents which is also the house in Paris where he grew up; and suddenly when Marc overhears that he will be committed to a psychiatric hospital Marc goes to extremes to avoid that as he runs away frantically. Where he goes and what happens next is all very interesting and again it is all open to interpretation.There's much, much more to the plot than this--it may seem as if I've given too much away but I assure you that I haven't. Look also for a good albeit performance by Hei Poon Yuen as a hotel manager.The DVD comes with a featurette that explores the making of the film and there is an optional running director/producer commentary as well.La Moustache is very creative although the story doesn't always make sense. This type of art is open to individual interpretation and hence there have been many different interpretations of the meaning of the plot and its twists. Some have even said that it's not even meant to make sense; and that's possible, too!

1028571,A387BD735MI50R,B000JLTS3K,R. Schultz,"[8, 9]","The cover of this DVD misleads when it likens its drama to Hitchcock's work. There is actually nothing approaching a Hitchcock level of suspense here. However, the viewer is kept intellectually guessing, ping-ponging back and forth at least through the first part of the film, wondering,  ""Did the man have a moustache, or didn't he? Is he gaslighting his wife, or is she gaslighting him?""Like the French language itself, there are so many letters of explanation in this film that don't get pronounced, but that inform the pronunciation of other letters in the words. Director Emmanuel Carrere refers to ""ghosts"" whose presence is felt, trailing the characters' lives. However again, none of this rises to the level of suspense.Most of the value of this movie lies in its view of a marriage. This is an adult relationship, different from the kind we see in most American films where one spouse (usually the woman) is shown as mere adjunct to the man's answering call to action. Here both partners are given gravity and tenderness and extension.Actor Vincent Lindon is especially good at showing a longing bafflement. He doesn't undermine his performance by distancing himself from his character as many Americans might when called upon to play a man who isn't conforming to all gender stereotypes. Here Lindon is unflinching as a man who is not interested in football and who gets lost, almost waif-like, in what might be the complexities of his own imagining.There's a good director/producer commentary on this DVD, pointing out the ground from which some of the film's mists arise. But this isn't the movie for anyone who demands clear plot or resolution. In fact, the film is almost gratuitously devoid of explanations.

The film opens with Marc, a middle-aged Parisian, bathing and playfully asking his wife whether he should shave off his mustache.  They joke that she wouldn't be able to recognize him, as he's had a mustache his entire adult life.  Marc goes along with the joke and impulsively shaves; however, instead of being shocked, his wife doesn't notice.  He assumes that she's playing a joke, but she apparently isn't.  Things become stranger still when his friends and co-workers fail to notice the demise of the titular mustache as well.Only a French film could sustain this rather silly premise for nearly 90 minutes, although the mustache is merely the trigger for what follows.  The film's initial light comedic banter slowly changes to a tense, brooding tone as Marc starts to act erratically - all stemming from the mustache incident.  I was amused and intrigued throughout the film, although some viewers undoubtedly will find ""La Moustache"" boring depending on their tolerance level for semi-pretentious French films.  One could interpret the plot in a number of ways.  Marc might have gone mad, or the film might be an examination of how two people can never really know each other or about the disparity between how we view ourselves and how others views us.  At the end, I had no idea what the film was ""about"" or what the film ""meant,"" but I was entertained enough not to care.",4,The dangers of shaving,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,1503,"['La', 'Moustache', 'trippy', 'French', 'flick', 'director', 'Emmanuel', 'Carrere', 'adapted', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'Marc', 'middle-aged', 'Parisian', 'bathing', 'playfully', 'asking', 'wife', 'should', 'shave', 'off', 'mustache', 'joke', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'had', 'mustache', 'entire', 'adult', 'life', 'Marc', 'along', 'joke', 'impulsively', 'shaves', 'however', 'instead', 'being', 'shocked', 'wife', ""n't"", 'notice', 'playing', 'joke', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'Things', 'become', 'stranger', 'still', 'when', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'fail', 'notice', 'demise', 'titular', 'mustache', 'well.Only', 'French', 'film', 'could', 'sustain', 'rather', 'silly', 'premise', 'nearly', '90', 'minutes', 'mustache', 'merely', 'trigger', 'what', 'film', 'initial', 'light', 'comedic', 'banter', 'slowly', 'changes', 'tense', 'brooding', 'tone', 'Marc', 'act', 'erratically', 'stemming', 'mustache', 'incident', 'was', 'amused', 'intrigued', 'film', 'viewers', 'undoubtedly', 'will', 'find', 'La', 'Moustache', 'boring', 'depending', 'tolerance', 'level', 'semi-pretentious', 'French', 'films', 'One', 'could', 'interpret', 'plot', 'number', 'ways', 'Marc', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'mad', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'examination', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'other', 'disparity', 'how', 'view', 'how', 'others', 'views', 'end', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'what', 'film', 'meant', 'was', 'entertained', 'enough', 'not', 'care']",N/A
