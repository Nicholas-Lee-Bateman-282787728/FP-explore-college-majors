Tracy Pollan shines as Det. Lindsay Boxer and does a really great job.  The movie itself is somewhat predictable to a certain degree but, in typical James Patters fashion, it is full of suspense and twists.  This movie is based on the first book of the Women's Murder Club series and fantastic.  (I wish they would make movies for the next 6 books that are currently in the series.)  If you like mysteries, James Patterson, Tracy Pollan or any combination of these, you will like this movie.",5,Great Movie!,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,635,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'author', 'James', 'Patterson', 'movie', 'really', 'depicted', 'images', 'had', 'mind', 'reading', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Tracy', 'Pollan', 'Det', 'Lindsay', 'Boxer', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'certain', 'degree', 'typical', 'James', 'Patters', 'fashion', 'full', 'suspense', 'twists', 'movie', 'based', 'first', 'book', 'Women', 'Murder', 'Club', 'series', 'fantastic', 'wish', 'would', 'make', 'movies', 'next', '6', 'books', 'are', 'currently', 'series', 'like', 'mysteries', 'James', 'Patterson', 'Tracy', 'Pollan', 'combination', 'will', 'like', 'movie']",First to Die

Due to: First of all the main highlight of the Woman's Murder Club seires is that it takes place in San Francisco and in this movie you dont even know where this takes place,  Secondly the script and the movie as it goes along it goes more and more off the content and story of the fantasic book that it is (like for instance one of the characters of the Womans Murder Club in this movie was invented by the script writers, they repalced one of the characters with a fictional one and the one that is in the club ,in the book, was in the movie but as a side character).  DONT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE A TRUE JAMES PATTERSON FAN. You the JP fan will probably use this DVD as an expensive coster for your drinks.Cant wait for the ABC series of The Woman's Murder Club that will premier this fall.  Hopefully they will do the book series justis.",1,James Patterson was probably shaking his head.......,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,944,"['James', 'patterson', 'was', 'probably', 'shaking', 'head', 'when', 'saw', 'final', 'cut', 'film', 'let', 'alone', 'script', 'Due', 'First', 'main', 'highlight', 'Woman', 'Murder', 'Club', 'place', 'San', 'Francisco', 'movie', 'dont', 'even', 'know', 'where', 'place', 'Secondly', 'script', 'movie', 'more', 'more', 'content', 'story', 'fantasic', 'book', 'instance', 'one', 'characters', 'Womans', 'Murder', 'Club', 'movie', 'was', 'invented', 'script', 'writers', 'repalced', 'one', 'characters', 'fictional', 'one', 'one', 'club', 'book', 'was', 'movie', 'side', 'character', 'DONT', 'BUY', 'THIS', 'IF', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'A', 'TRUE', 'JAMES', 'PATTERSON', 'FAN', 'JP', 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'use', 'DVD', 'expensive', 'coster', 'drinks.Cant', 'wait', 'ABC', 'series', 'Woman', 'Murder', 'Club', 'will', 'premier', 'fall', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'do', 'book', 'series', 'justis']",First to Die

831168,A2GHM8Y19ZMO30,B0002DB5K4,Mark Chrisco,"[7, 7]","This NBC Event Movie is a very close adaption of a James Patterson novel of the same name following the police investigation of the ""Bride and Groom"" murders led by Det. Lindsay Boxer, a cop with major problems of her own. This is a very good adaption, featuring a strong performance by Tracey Pollan as Lindsay in a twisty mystery. The only problem is the mis-casting of Robert Patrick as Nicholas Jenks. The part called for a less intense personality.I had hoped for another film, adapting the second book in the series, 2nd Chances, but, the plot perhaps was too similar to recent tragic events and may have been passed over.",4,Women's Murder Club,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,628,"['NBC', 'Event', 'Movie', 'very', 'close', 'adaption', 'James', 'Patterson', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'following', 'police', 'investigation', 'Bride', 'Groom', 'murders', 'led', 'Det', 'Lindsay', 'Boxer', 'cop', 'major', 'problems', 'own', 'very', 'good', 'adaption', 'featuring', 'strong', 'performance', 'Tracey', 'Pollan', 'Lindsay', 'twisty', 'mystery', 'only', 'problem', 'mis-casting', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Nicholas', 'Jenks', 'part', 'called', 'less', 'intense', 'personality.I', 'had', 'hoped', 'film', 'adapting', 'second', 'book', 'series', '2nd', 'Chances', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'was', 'too', 'similar', 'recent', 'tragic', 'events', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'passed']",First to Die
831169,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0002DB5K4,Michael Butts,"[1, 2]","James Patterson's novels are full of twists and turns, and his 1ST TO DIE is no exception.  In translating this novel to the screen (Which by the way WAS a miniseries on NBC), the storyline is basically the same, with some changes for dramatic effect particularly in the denouement.However, in bringing ""The Women's Murder Club"" to life, director Russell Mulcahy puts together a good cast:  Tracy Pollan as the police detective with a rare blood disease; Carly Pope as the cub reporter out to make the big story; Pam Grier as the feisty and loyal medical examiner; and Megan Gallagher as the district attorney (although Gallagher is given little to do in the screen version).  Gil Bellows as Pollan's love interest does well, as does Robert Patrick as egotistical novelist Nicholas Jenks.  Angie Everhart fills out the cast as Jenks' submissive and obedient wife.The plot revolves around a serial killer who is killing newlyweds, and the detective and friends frantically tries to piece together the clues to come up with the culprit.  There are a couple of surprises near the end, but they are not the same as in the book, so if you've read the book, be prepared.  I think sometimes they change the murderer because they don't want the people who've read the book to know from the start who the killer is.
