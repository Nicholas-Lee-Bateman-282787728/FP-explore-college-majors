328200,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302697042,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Lacerating in it's unraveling on two marriages, `Husbands and Wives' is a delicate yet abruptly harsh depiction of what can (and often does) happen in a relationship.  The dialog is sharp, the sequences are well timed and executed, the humor is dark and often misguiding (which is key to this type of film) and the acting is, in a word, superb.The film dissects the relationships between two couples.  Sally and Jack have reached a mutual end to their relationship and have decided to split up, temporarily, in order to see how single life suits them.  This comes as a severe blow to their friends Gabe and Judy, especially to Judy.  As the film progresses the after effects of the separation weigh heavy on both Sally and Jack as they endeavor to start over with new lovers.  In the meantime, Judy and Gabe begin to unravel as Gabe forms affections for a student of his and Judy begins to fantasize over Sally's new boyfriend, Michael.If there is one complaint I have here, it is that Woody Allen seems to put the bulk of the relationship `blame' on the women instead of weaving an even and equal distribution of quilt.  Sally is cold and critical.  Judy is manipulative and needy.  While their husbands obviously have their faults (both men chase after the affections of a younger woman) it is apparent that they are driven their by the repulsively controlling habits of their wives.  Having been married for a number of years and been through a separation where both parties initially blamed the other for everything, it is only through the realization that there are faults on all sides of the marriage that we were able to come together as a united front against our own failures, thus saving our marriage and working towards a better relationship.  Sadly, in my opinion, Allen fails to really paint the faults of his two male leads; or, if they have faults, they are heavily masked by the overly obvious faults of the two female characters.Or maybe I'm too blinded by my own personal experience and thus have missed the point entirely.All that said, I still consider this film to be a great film, and one I highly recommend.  I just don't think that it succeeded in being as universally informative as it could have been.  The film comes off a tad one sided in my opinion.The acting is ferocious though, and really deserves to be singled out.  All four main actors are stunning here.  I often note that Woody Allen tends to play the same character in all of his films, but I love when he can add layers of color to his single persona.  This is one of those times where he is distinctly layered (as he is in `Sleeper', `Annie Hall' and `Hannah and Her Sisters').  While he has similarities to his other `characters', he is truly IN this character.  Mia Farrow is simply stunning here as well, developing a woman at the edge of her desires, living vicariously through a friend she simultaneously admires as well as despises, all for the same reasons.She wants to be her.But, this film belongs to Judy Davis and Sydney Pollack.  Pollack is sheer genius as Jack.  He understands how to creep into the subtle actions to create a man who just wants to be happy but doesn't understand how to be.  As great as he is, Davis is better.  To be honest, I'm glad that Tomei won an Oscar, but it should have been for one of her stunning performances this past decade.  Davis is all sorts of seething perfection here that her Oscar loss may be one of the worst in the history of Oscar.  The way she manipulates her characters anger is phenomenal.  That explosion of telephone accusations is stunning, and the way she nonchalantly scrutinizes everything and everyone around her is so spot-on you swear she's not acting at all.In the end I really like this movie.  I don't think it quite accomplishes what it so desperately wants to, but I think that it is an important and provocative piece of filmmaking that is bound to start good debate.  The acting is exquisite and the films overall tone is engaging.  Woody is a master storyteller, and he works lots of magic on this one.",4,Relationships simmering in contention...,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,4067,"['Lacerating', 'unraveling', 'two', 'marriages', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'delicate', 'yet', 'abruptly', 'harsh', 'depiction', 'what', 'can', 'often', 'happen', 'relationship', 'dialog', 'sharp', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'timed', 'executed', 'humor', 'dark', 'often', 'misguiding', 'key', 'type', 'film', 'acting', 'word', 'superb.The', 'film', 'relationships', 'two', 'couples', 'Sally', 'Jack', 'have', 'reached', 'mutual', 'end', 'relationship', 'have', 'decided', 'split', 'up', 'temporarily', 'order', 'see', 'how', 'single', 'life', 'suits', 'severe', 'blow', 'friends', 'Gabe', 'Judy', 'especially', 'Judy', 'film', 'effects', 'separation', 'weigh', 'heavy', 'Sally', 'Jack', 'endeavor', 'start', 'new', 'lovers', 'meantime', 'Judy', 'Gabe', 'begin', 'unravel', 'Gabe', 'forms', 'affections', 'student', 'Judy', 'fantasize', 'Sally', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Michael.If', 'one', 'complaint', 'have', 'here', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'put', 'bulk', 'relationship', 'blame', 'women', 'instead', 'weaving', 'even', 'equal', 'distribution', 'quilt', 'Sally', 'cold', 'critical', 'Judy', 'manipulative', 'needy', 'husbands', 'obviously', 'have', 'faults', 'men', 'chase', 'affections', 'younger', 'woman', 'apparent', 'are', 'driven', 'repulsively', 'controlling', 'habits', 'wives', 'Having', 'been', 'married', 'number', 'years', 'been', 'separation', 'where', 'parties', 'initially', 'blamed', 'other', 'everything', 'only', 'realization', 'are', 'faults', 'sides', 'marriage', 'were', 'able', 'come', 'together', 'united', 'front', 'own', 'failures', 'thus', 'saving', 'marriage', 'working', 'towards', 'better', 'relationship', 'Sadly', 'opinion', 'Allen', 'really', 'paint', 'faults', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'have', 'faults', 'are', 'heavily', 'masked', 'overly', 'obvious', 'faults', 'two', 'female', 'characters.Or', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'blinded', 'own', 'personal', 'experience', 'thus', 'have', 'missed', 'point', 'entirely.All', 'said', 'still', 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'succeeded', 'being', 'universally', 'informative', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'off', 'tad', 'one', 'sided', 'opinion.The', 'acting', 'ferocious', 'really', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'four', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'stunning', 'here', 'often', 'note', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'play', 'same', 'character', 'films', 'love', 'when', 'can', 'add', 'layers', 'color', 'single', 'persona', 'one', 'times', 'where', 'distinctly', 'layered', 'Sleeper', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'similarities', 'other', 'characters', 'truly', 'IN', 'character', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'simply', 'stunning', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'developing', 'woman', 'edge', 'desires', 'living', 'vicariously', 'friend', 'simultaneously', 'as', 'well', 'despises', 'same', 'reasons.She', 'be', 'her.But', 'film', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'Pollack', 'sheer', 'genius', 'Jack', 'how', 'creep', 'subtle', 'actions', 'create', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'happy', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'be', 'As', 'great', 'Davis', 'better', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Tomei', 'won', 'Oscar', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'stunning', 'performances', 'past', 'decade', 'Davis', 'sorts', 'seething', 'perfection', 'here', 'Oscar', 'loss', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'history', 'Oscar', 'way', 'characters', 'anger', 'phenomenal', 'explosion', 'telephone', 'accusations', 'stunning', 'way', 'nonchalantly', 'everything', 'everyone', 'so', 'spot-on', 'swear', 'not', 'acting', 'end', 'really', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'what', 'so', 'desperately', 'think', 'important', 'provocative', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'bound', 'start', 'good', 'debate', 'acting', 'exquisite', 'films', 'overall', 'tone', 'engaging', 'Woody', 'master', 'storyteller', 'lots', 'magic', 'one']",N/A

328203,A20IIR0422G3A5,6302697042,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[7, 8]","`Husbands and Wives' is writer / director Woody Allen's last movie before his breakup with Mia Farrow, and, of course, the last in a long series of movies in which Farrow is his costar. As noted in more than one news article in 1992, when this movie was released, it is remarkably predictive of the Allen Farrow breakup and even on the issue over which they would split.I saw this movie soon after it was released in 1992 and I have not looked forward to viewing it again in order to give a review of this DVD edition. The movie is probably not one of Allen's very best among his later comedies such as `Crimes and Misdemeanors', `Bullets over Broadway', and `Mighty Aphrodite', but it includes what may be some of his most disturbing scenes since `Interiors'. One scene in particular between costar Sydney Pollack and Lysette Anthony  is about as emotionally disturbing as all the murder victim scenes from an entire season of CSI rolled into one. This scene really shows off Allen's writing talent. A physically brief scuffle between a middle-aged intellectual and his intellectually lightweight young paramour, becomes a viscerally painful image of a breakdown of relations between two people. Allen's talent is even plainer when we see the girl trapped in the situation where she must stay with the man until he deigns to take her home from a party probably in the darkest Hamptons, far from home base in Manhattan.Allen has never been the most polished technician with his filmmaking, but he almost always has a major talent behind the camera. In this case, it is Carlo Di Palma. In spite of this, the coordination between the actors business and the camera's point of view is remarkably like a series of `Candid Camera' shots. I almost looked for a credit for the person responsible for being sure there was a lampshade obscuring part of the camera's view in all interior shots. The editing was also explicitly done in a somewhat choppy manner, giving some sense of a documentary style. It was quite clearly not done as a `Documentary' in the same style as `Zelig', but all the technical aspects of editing and cinematography were distinctly raw. Since I have seen enough Allen movies to know this must have been intentional and not due to a lack of skill, I have mixed feelings over whether this choppyness contributes anything to the experience of the story. I am quite certain that unlike the documentary feel of some parts of `Bananas', it does nothing to add any humor to the story. If anything, it heightens the feeling of awkwardness surrounding the principal characters' actions.As usual, I find myself disagreeing with Peter Travers' blurb from his review in `Rolling Stone' where he uses the phrase `Fiercely funny' in describing the film. In fact, I did not once break out into a laugh as I watched this movie, although the fact that I was watching it alone may have had a lot to do with that fact. But, I have been known to giggle or laugh at least four or five times in the course of an average `The West Wing' episode, even those I may have seen two or three times. (And who said politics isn't funny.)In more ways than one, this film seems to hark back to the days when Allen split his time between film making and writing short stories for `The New Yorker'. Allen's character is a professor of writing and literature at Columbia, and is credited with having several short stories published in that very same `New Yorker' magazine. Allen's character is also biographical in many other ways, not the least of which was the quip that he probably could not survive for more than 48 hours off the island of Manhattan. (I did crack a smile at this line.)As usual, Manhattan street scenes and apartments are the primary venues for almost all the shots in the movie. There is a short detour to a middle class home in Brooklyn, but most scenes are in what are probably very expensive apartments on the Upper East Side.This film is definitely not as interesting or as funny as, for example, `Crimes and Misdemeanors', and yet it is possibly even more powerful emotionally, in spite of the fact that the other movie had a homicide and this film only has bruised emotions. This is even less a comedy than the intentionally seriocomic `Melinda and Melinda'.I would not recommend this movie to a non-Woody Allen fan, but for people who like and respect his work, this may be one of his most important films.",4,Exceptional Portrait of Relations between Men and Women.

Liam Neeson works at the same publishing house as mia farrow and she gradually becomes more and more interested in him. this pretty much mirrors the way allen did break up with farrow. he was so compartmentalized, with his emotions already over now that he has a new love interest, that he assumed they could continue acting together.  she did not share this view and was more like the characters played by pollack and davis, enraged for a very long time (possibly still enraged).it is a fascinating portrait of marital breakups.  it is well observed, well nuanced.  it is pollack and davis who really knock it out of the park though.  they are sensational.",5,made when the real life breakup was occurring,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,2068,"['film', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'woody', 'allen', 'mia', 'farrow', 'went', 'explosive', 'real', 'life', 'breakup', 'where', 'left', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'was', 'popular', 'precisely', 'reason', 'are', 'two', 'breakups', 'going', 'film', 'one', 'i', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'was', 'late', 'sydney', 'pollack', 'judy', 'davis', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'pollack', 'started', 'out', 'actor', 'transitioned', 'being', 'director', 'found', 'great', 'success', 'commercially', 'artistically', 'however', 'also', 'acted', 'few', 'films', 'was', 'always', 'treat', 'see', 'do', 'role', 'one', 'Kubrick', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'were', 'very', 'best.pollack', 'married', 'film', 'judy', 'davis', 'are', 'perfect', 'pairing', 'split', 'up', 'start', 'film', 'up', 'young', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'two', 'sling', 'emotions', 'there', 'public', 'consumption', 'break', 'up', 'wild', 'passionate', 'even', 'verging', 'violent', 'indeed', 'way', 'people', 'breakup', 'probably', 'more', 'cathartic', 'way', 'do', 'so.another', 'mode', 'breakup', 'one', 'characters', 'played', 'woody', 'allen', 'mia', 'farrow', 'compartmentalize', 'one', 'gradually', 'other', 'out', 'scouting', 'out', 'possible', 'new', 'love', 'interests', 'student', 'being', 'college', 'prof', 'student', 'slew', 'older', 'men', 'wake', 'played', 'perfection', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'same', 'publishing', 'house', 'mia', 'farrow', 'gradually', 'more', 'more', 'interested', 'pretty', 'much', 'mirrors', 'way', 'allen', 'did', 'break', 'up', 'farrow', 'was', 'so', 'compartmentalized', 'emotions', 'already', 'now', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'assumed', 'could', 'continue', 'acting', 'together', 'did', 'not', 'share', 'view', 'was', 'more', 'characters', 'played', 'pollack', 'davis', 'enraged', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'possibly', 'still', 'enraged', '.it', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'marital', 'breakups', 'well', 'observed', 'well', 'nuanced', 'pollack', 'davis', 'who', 'really', 'knock', 'park', 'are', 'sensational']",N/A
328205,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6302697042,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[5, 6]","Husbands and Wives was released in 1992, and it is the last movie Woody Allen made with Mia Farrow--their unlucky thirteenth. It was released just in time to benefit from intense interest in the courtroom stand off between Woody and Mia over Woody's relationship with Mia's adopted daughter, Soon-Yi. Not to say that this was a calculated career move, but the film did better at the box office than any of his other films. It offered uncanny parallels into the real life drama, but it also differed in many respects. Still, it was weird how life imitated art, or vice versa.As the opening credits roll, we hear a vintage recording of Cole Porter's ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" The first scene shows Creative Writing Professor Gabe Roth (Woody Allen) watching a documentary on Einstein where the great thinker is quoted saying ""God doesn't throw dice with the universe."" Gabe quips, ""No, he only plays Hide & Seek.""Gabe and Judy Roth (Mia Farrow) are going to dinner with another married couple, Jack (Sydney Pollack) and Sally (Judy Davis). They arrive and announce they are separating before going out for Chinese food. Judy is the most upset, but Jack and Sally claim it was a mutual decision, and they are fine with it. Meanwhile Gabe, who is a writing professor, is becoming interested in one of his students (Juliette Lewis). Jack starts seeing an aerobics instructor (Lysette Anthony), and Sally tries to date, but they both become extremely jealous of each other when they find out they're seeing other people. Judy has set up Sally with a colleague, (Liam Neeson) who is interested in her, but Sally is now too preoccupied with her husband to notice. Judy regrets setting Sally up, because she is starting to fall for him herself.The only gimmick used in this film is a kind of documentary style, with wobbly hand held camera, sometimes following characters as they dart from the room, barely catching a glimpse as they leave. Some shots are purposely obscured, to give it a gritty look, as if you are a casual observer, or a fly-on-the-wall. Other times characters are grilled by an off camera voice--presumably their analyst--giving them a chance to reveal their innermost thoughts talking directly to the camera. This technique is now used on the sit com The Office, by the way.As a rumination on Married Life, a response to Cole Porter's question, what is this thing called love? Woody is surprisingly insightful. Sally and Jack have the ring of truth, especially when they are responding with jealousy. Great performances by Judy Davis and Sydney Pollack. Mia is great and believable as Judy Roth, and Liam Neeson plays his part well. Juliette Lewis is fantastic as Gabe's young student, Rain.My only quibble is with Woody's character, Gabe Roth. I feel like Woody, as writer and director, deliberately stacked the deck, almost as if he was already preparing his defense for the upcoming Soon-Yi showdown. He has every reason to justify a fling with Rain, but the most he will allow himself is a kiss in the rain. Like, he COULD have had a fling with her, but he CHOSE not to. Even though her parents idolize him for his writing, and practically beg him to go to her birthday party, and she has already had a string of older lovers, culminating in her therapist, who confronts Gabe as he drops her off prior to meeting her parents. He asks him if he seduces all of his students, giving Gabe the chance to squirm uncomfortably, playing the innocent martyr. This scene was made even creepier by a slight misunderstanding and confusion of mine--that I thought Juliette Lewis was Rachel Griffiths, because Rain's therapist was played by Ron Rifkin, who plays Rachel's Uncle Saul on the television show: Brothers & Sisters.But Juliette Lewis is great as Rain, named after poet Rainer Maria Rilke by her poetry lovin' mom (Blythe Danner). The student/teacher exchanges function as a parody of Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet. She is just talented enough to justify Gabe's interest, while blinded by his mid-life infatuation, and she has the good sense to lose Gabe's novel in a taxi cab. Plus, she looks great in her Catholic School Girl pleated plaid skirt.Rain: I spent five days searching for the perfect word to describe the husband and that's when I came up with ""apucious"".Gabe: Apucious. I looked it up in the dictionary but I couldn't find it.Rain: Yeah, I know. I made it up.Gabe: Oh, really.Rain: Yeah. I thought it described him perfectly.Though neither character's writing is actually very good, the script and writing of Husbands and Wives is another story--apart from the one ""aupucious"" lapse due to Woody's need to rationalize and justify his own ""aupucious"" lapse.Some other films by Woody Allen Featuring Mia Farrow (with fun facts and trivia courtesy of imdb dot com):A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy(1982) Woody Allen wrote the role of Ariel for Diane Keaton, but she couldn't take the part because she was busy promoting her film Reds (1981) and preparing for Alan Parker's Shoot the Moon (1982). The first time Woody Allen appeared in one of his own films as part of an ensemble cast. Prior to this, he was either the main character or not in the film at all. The first time Mia Farrow appeared in a Woody Allen film. Woody Allen wrote the screenplay in 2 weeks.Zelig(1983) To create authenticity, the production used actual lenses, cameras and sound equipment from the 1920s, and used the exact same lighting that would have been done. In addition, 'Gordon Willis' took the exposed negatives to the shower, and stomped on them. In order to help create the look of genuine footage from the 1930s, DuArt, the lab that handled processing, called some of their experienced technicians (who were experienced with processing techniques of the 1930s) out of retirement.Broadway Danny Rose(1984) The reason Mia Farrow wears sunglasses most of the film is that Woody Allen did not feel she could pass herself as a tough Italian ""broad"", so he had her wear the sunglasses most of the film to hide her eyes, making her seem more sultry and mysterious. The only time she removes the sunglasses is when her character is supposed to be more vulnerable.The Purple Rose of Cairo(1985) Woody Allen has said more than once that this is his favorite of the movies he's made. After this film was previewed, word got back to Woody Allen that if he just changed his ending, he could have a big hit. Allen declined, saying that the ending is one of the reasons he made the film. In an interview in Esquire, Woody Allen was asked why he didn't make a happy ending to the film. Allen replied, ""That *was* the happy ending.""Hannah and Her Sisters(1986) Many of Hannah's scenes were filmed in Mia Farrow's actual apartment. Allen said that Farrow once had the eerie experience of turning on the TV to a chance broadcast of the movie thus viewing her own apartment on TV while she was sitting in it. According to USA Today, upon the film's original release, a movement was afoot to try to make Allen's script the first screenplay to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. The poem Eliot gives Lee which contains the line ""nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands"", is the poem ""somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond"", by e.e. cummings. The book of poems by e.e. cummings is entitled ?Complete Poems 1913 ? 1962?, and the poem ?Somewhere? is on page 366. With a box office gross of over $40 million, this film represented Woody Allen's most financially successful film until Match Point (2005) in 2005. Four of Mia Farrow's real-life children appear in this film. Two appear as Hannah's son and daughter in the movie, while the other two (including Soon-Yi Previn, who Woody Allen would eventually marry in 1997) appear as young guests in the Thanksgiving scenes.Radio Days(1987) This is the only Woody Allen film in which both of his frequent collaborators and longtime companions Mia Farrow and Diane Keaton appear.September(1987) Director Woody Allen cast and shot this film twice, without telling the original cast. Woody Allen decided to make the film for two main reasons. One was because he had always wanted to do a ""chamber piece"", a film with a small cast (there are only six principal characters, and only nine in the entire film) in a single location. The other was for the location itself, Mia Farrow's Connecticut country house, which inspired Woody Allen to write the screenplay with the intention that it would be shot at the house. Unfortunately, by the time Allen finished the screenplay, it was winter and the location was unusable for a movie so firmly planted in September. The entire movie (which takes place in Vermont) was shot on a single soundstage at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. According to Mia Farrow's autobiography ""What Falls Away"", Woody Allen filmed two or three versions of every scene, took all of the footage into the editing suite, cut the film together and then decided that he hated it. He then rewrote the entire script, fired and recast virtually every major part, and re-filmed the entire thing. This meant that he doubled his production costs and came in well behind schedule. Allen was reportedly keen to do it all againAnother Woman(1988) Originally Mia Farrow was supposed to have played the part of Marion but her real-life pregnancy prevented that. Gena Rowlands took the part instead.Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) One third of the film had Woody Allen's character shooting a documentary on old vaudevillians, with Mia Farrow as the head of the institute to which they belonged. Allen didn't like the scenes in the final cut. During postproduction he cut an entire third of the film, then rewrote and re-shot the third of the film from scratch. As a result, Sean Young's scenes were cut out, and Daryl Hannah's role was reduced to a brief cameo.New York Stories Segment: ""Oedipus Wrecks"" (1989) At 33 minutes, Francis Ford Coppola's segment is the shortest. Woody Allen's clocks in at 40 minutes, while Scorsese's runs to 45 minutes. The performance piece that Steve Buscemi delivers in the Martin Scorsese segment was conceived and written by the actor himself. Jessie Keosian, who plays Aunt Ceil in the Woody Allen segment, ""Oedipus Wrecks,"" was Allen's high school biology teacher. They had not met since high school until the audition for this film.Alice(1990) His role as Dr. Yang was the final film role for Keye Luke. He died only weeks after this film was released.Shadows and Fog(1992) Based on a one-act comedy play called ""Death"", published in Woody Allen's ""Without Feathers"" (1972), the play and movie are themselves a pastiche of Franz Josef Kafka's work in general, and of his novel ""The Trial"" in particular. Reminds me of this scene from Annie Hall:Pam: Sex with you is really a Kafka-esque experience.Alvy Singer: Oh. Thank you.Pam: I mean that as a compliment.Husbands and Wives (1992) Hoping to piggyback on the scandal surrounding Woody Allen's break-up with Mia Farrow, TriStar opened the film on 865 screens, the largest amount ever given over to a Woody Allen picture. They were rewarded with an opening weekend of $3.52 million, the biggest ever for an Allen film. Woody Allen said in an interview that the reason he shot the film the way he did was that he wanted to break the usual rules of filmmaking. He cut scenes right in the middle of dialog, he used hand held cameras for no particular reason and did not care if he showed the side or the back of a performer's head during a scene. Allen said for this reason, he felt this film was one of his best. Sydney Pollack stated that although he liked working on the film, he did not like the character he played. Contrary to general perception, Mia Farrow's role is not autobiographical. Indeed, Woody Allen originally wrote the Judy Davis part with the idea of Farrow playing it. Farrow chose to take on the role of Gabe's wife instead as it meant less shooting time for her.",4,Soon ye will be in an even bigger debacle,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,11933,"['Husbands', 'Wives',

Middleton,"[3, 3]","When first watching this film, it was akin to a voyeur, a fly on the wall, a third party witnessing the painful yet swift destruction of a marriage.The timing of this film was uncanny and seemed planned; Allen knew exactly what he was doing, the protagonist falling for a younger woman, something that middle-aged men do at times.Allen casted his wife, Ms. Farrow, in all his important films to date, and with Husbands and Wives, her last really major film, thus she never starred or took part in another Allen film again.The reason for this fall out, in ""real life"", Allen had fallen in love with his step daughter and began an affair. He eventually married her and to present time, they are still married, and appear to be doing well.Ms. Farrow's career, however, simply disappeared and she has not made a film of worth since her divorce from Allen and the subsequent scandal.This is an original film, a look into human nature, particularly man's nature, proving their rise in virility at a time of doubt and middle age, when the hair recedes, the belly grows and younger women appear attractive because they need to prove their worth as a ""male"". Similar to an old lion, the King of the Pride is exiled because he is too weak to run the show.The cast is remarkable. Judy Davis as Sally as usual, portrayed a gritty, aggressive self absorbed woman, leaving her husband, Jack, Sidney Pollack, for a ""new aged"" man; Michael Gates, played with true honesty by Liam Neeson, does a wonderful job as the rebound. Pollack's performance is perfect, as the ""mid-life-crises"" male looking for love in all the wrong places. The ""party scene"" where he drags his young ""girlfriend"" out of his friend's party because of his embarrassment, her stupid, unrelated exposition on astrology, to his ""intellectual"" friends, brought him to the edge:(the scene outside the house was Oscar material) a truly wonderful performance by Pollack, a great director but also a damn good actor.In the end, though truly original, Husbands and Wives is an honest look at modern relationships, our weaknesses, our desires, and the consequences of those desires.Husbands and Wives is one of the better Allen films of his career.",5,One of the Better Allen Films,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,2194,"['When', 'first', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'akin', 'voyeur', 'fly', 'wall', 'third', 'party', 'witnessing', 'painful', 'yet', 'swift', 'destruction', 'marriage.The', 'timing', 'film', 'was', 'uncanny', 'seemed', 'planned', 'Allen', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'protagonist', 'falling', 'younger', 'woman', 'something', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'do', 'times.Allen', 'casted', 'wife', 'Ms.', 'Farrow', 'important', 'films', 'date', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'last', 'really', 'major', 'film', 'thus', 'never', 'starred', 'took', 'part', 'Allen', 'film', 'again.The', 'reason', 'fall', 'out', 'real', 'life', 'Allen', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'step', 'daughter', 'began', 'affair', 'eventually', 'married', 'present', 'time', 'are', 'still', 'married', 'appear', 'be', 'doing', 'well.Ms', 'Farrow', 'career', 'however', 'simply', 'disappeared', 'not', 'made', 'film', 'worth', 'divorce', 'Allen', 'subsequent', 'scandal.This', 'original', 'film', 'look', 'human', 'nature', 'particularly', 'man', 'nature', 'proving', 'rise', 'virility', 'time', 'doubt', 'middle', 'age', 'when', 'hair', 'recedes', 'belly', 'grows', 'younger', 'women', 'appear', 'attractive', 'need', 'prove', 'worth', 'male', 'Similar', 'old', 'lion', 'King', 'Pride', 'exiled', 'too', 'weak', 'run', 'show.The', 'cast', 'remarkable', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'as', 'Sally', 'usual', 'portrayed', 'gritty', 'aggressive', 'self', 'absorbed', 'woman', 'leaving', 'husband', 'Jack', 'Sidney', 'Pollack', 'new', 'aged', 'man', 'Michael', 'Gates', 'played', 'true', 'honesty', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'wonderful', 'job', 'rebound', 'Pollack', 'performance', 'perfect', 'mid-life-crises', 'male', 'looking', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'party', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'girlfriend', 'friend', 'party', 'embarrassment', 'stupid', 'unrelated', 'exposition', 'astrology', 'intellectual', 'friends', 'brought', 'edge', 'scene', 'house', 'was', 'Oscar', 'material', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Pollack', 'great', 'director', 'also', 'damn', 'good', 'end', 'truly', 'original', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'honest', 'look', 'modern', 'relationships', 'weaknesses', 'desires', 'consequences', 'desires.Husbands', 'Wives', 'one', 'better', 'Allen', 'films', 'career']",N/A

Davis,"[7, 8]","A married couple strolls into a Manhattan apartment and announces--to another married couple--that they've decided to split up for a trial run--just to see what it would be like to be single again...An obvious  dramatic conceit?  Watch and see...This is a superb Woody Allen drama  from the early 90s, and it's kind of like Alvy and Annie fifteen years  later--had they made it to begin with.  We all know, even before the black  screen with the 1940s jazz soundtrack appears, that Allen's characters are  dissatisfied, whimpering, anxiety-ridden Manhattanites who think they  deserve better--in love and in life--and therein lies the genesis of each  character's dissoluteness and [im] or [a] morality.  That's a key question  for the student of Woody Allen's films:  do we have the right to think we  deserve better?  See what the characters have to say about it.  Judy Davis  turns in a marvelously comedic and dramatic performance--worthy of the  Oscar!  I'm not a Sydney Pollack fan--he's icky--but as Judy Davis's  husband, he turns in a great performance as a dissatisfied husband who  wants a little more out of life--something other than being married to a  cold-in-bed, cerebral Simone-de-Beauvoir type brilliantly played by Davis.  They're an explosive couple who ultimately realize the meaning of  marriage--even if they can't pinpoint it exactly in every context.  Mia  Farrow does a good job in this film--for once she acts--maybe the realness  of her real-life situation (remember the scandal? )with her adopted  daughter brought out real emotions that were captured on-screen.  If you're  interested, read Farrow's biography (&quot;Things Fall  Away&quot;--available from amazon.com), and she'll pinpoint for you the  scenes she acted in after her knowledge of the Woody/SoonYi affair.  Allen  in this film is Allen--a writing professor who has a slight thing for  Juliette Lewis, a New York debutante/student-of-Allen's on the eve of her  21st birthday--her name is Rain and she's named after Rilke--what do you  think is the significance of that?  She brings out the stormy and  tempestuous side of love--but, as Lewis's character says to Allen,  &quot;Well...I'm worth it.&quot;  The only disappointing casting in this  film is Allen's casting of the horse-faced, lumpy and dumpy  obvious-as-a-limmerick Liam Neeson who ends up with Farrow in the end.  They deserve each other.This film will certainly make you rethink  marriage--heterosexual marriage anyway.  But then again, maybe you got that  from watching mom and dad...get this video instead.  At least these  characters are given witty dialogue and know the importance of opera and  theatre--so if love fails, at least there's that...",5,Just Too Marvelous For Words...But I'll Try,959644800,"05 30, 2000",2000,2710,"['married', 'couple', 'strolls', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'announces', 'married', 'couple', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'split', 'up', 'trial', 'run', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'single', 'again', 'obvious', 'dramatic', 'conceit', 'Watch', 'see', 'superb', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'drama', 'early', '90s', 'kind', 'like', 'Alvy', 'Annie', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'had', 'made', 'begin', 'know', 'even', 'black', 'screen', '1940s', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'Allen', 'characters', 'are', 'dissatisfied', 'whimpering', 'anxiety-ridden', 'Manhattanites', 'who', 'think', 'deserve', 'better', 'love', 'life', 'therein', 'genesis', 'character', 'dissoluteness', '[', 'im', ']', '[', ']', 'morality', 'key', 'question', 'student', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'do', 'have', 'right', 'think', 'deserve', 'better', 'See', 'what', 'characters', 'have', 'say', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'marvelously', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Oscar', ""'m"", 'not', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'fan', 'icky', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'husband', 'great', 'performance', 'dissatisfied', 'husband', 'who', 'little', 'more', 'life', 'something', 'other', 'being', 'married', 'cold-in-bed', 'cerebral', 'Simone-de-Beauvoir', 'type', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Davis', ""'re"", 'explosive', 'couple', 'who', 'ultimately', 'realize', 'meaning', 'marriage', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pinpoint', 'exactly', 'context', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'once', 'maybe', 'realness', 'real-life', 'situation', 'remember', 'scandal', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'brought', 'out', 'real', 'emotions', 'were', 'captured', 'on-screen', ""'re"", 'interested', 'read', 'Farrow', 'biography', 'quot', 'Things', 'Fall', 'Away', 'quot', 'available', 'amazon.com', ""'ll"", 'pinpoint', 'scenes', 'acted', 'knowledge', 'Woody/SoonYi', 'affair', 'Allen', 'film', 'Allen', 'writing', 'professor', 'who', 'slight', 'thing', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'New', 'York', 'debutante/student-of-Allen', 'eve', '21st', 'birthday', 'name', 'Rain', 'named', 'Rilke', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'significance', 'out', 'stormy', 'tempestuous', 'side', 'love', 'Lewis', 'character', 'Allen', 'quot', 'Well', ""'m"", 'worth', 'it.', 'quot', 'only', 'disappointing', 'casting', 'film', 'Allen', 'casting', 'horse-faced', 'lumpy', 'dumpy', 'obvious-as-a-limmerick', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'up', 'Farrow', 'end', 'deserve', 'other.This', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'rethink', 'marriage', 'heterosexual', 'marriage', 'anyway', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'got', 'watching', 'mom', 'dad', 'get', 'video', 'instead', 'least', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'know', 'importance', 'opera', 'theatre', 'so', 'love', 'fails', 'least']",N/A

We see manipulation posing as truth, vulnerable facades imitating intimacy, lust mimicking passion, and discover, in the end, that perhaps the only true desire in a Woody Allen movie is to dodge happiness &amp; to take pleasure in the misery of knowing that it probably wouldn't have worked out anyhow.Confused yet?I can't imagine anybody still in the &quot;honeymoon&quot; stage of a First Great Love appreciating this movie. For those scarred by years of relationship campaigning, much of Allen's view may ring all-too-true. I won't say how many times I saw myself, my wife, and ex-lovers plastered against the screen.Throughout the movie, individuals and couples long for intimacy, for lasting passion, for refreshment, but end up settling for comfort, manipulation, and denial. I wanted to scream. I hoped, hopelessly, for hope--this is, after all, a Woody Allen Movie--but was left, in the end, with Gabriel (literally &quot;God's Hero&quot;) telling viewers that love, romance, and passion can only exist as a neurotic and fleeting figment of experience.Damned if I'm willing to settle for that. And perhaps that's the great strength of this movie. It could, after all, be a satire, not about mid-life-crisis-men seeking youth through young lovers, but showing, in the crassest relief, how barriers and little deceits ultimately lead to destruction and misery in relationships. And maybe that's where the hope lies, in learning to be honest in a way that none of Allen's characters can be, not even with themselves.(If you'd like to discuss this review or DVD in more depths, please click the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

It is not a comedy but rather a dramedy that explores marriages and relationships of four main characters. It has several funny moments and dialogs (it is Allen after all) but it has disturbing and sad scenes, too.When Jack and Sally (Sidney Pollack and Judy Davis) announce that they're separating, this comes as a shock to their best friends Gabe and Judy (Allen and Farrow). They start to reevaluate their own marriage only to find out that it is not as perfect as they thought. Very soon Jack and Sally, and then Gabe and Judy start to meet new people - young, bright, and attractive. They all hope that new is better, and for some of them it is true while the others come to understanding that true love involves loving another's imperfections even when very well aware of them.This film is for all husbands and wives, lovers, and partners around the world. It is for couples who've been in a relationship for a month, a year, or decades. It is for singles who are ready or who think they want to enter a relationship. It is also for people who don't. All of us have been or may find ourselves in a situation or relationship or having a conversation like the ones in the Allen's film. All of us think and talk about love, trust, understanding, fidelity, sex, and yes - marriage.The best scenes of the film belong to Allen and Farrow. Some of their conversations in the movie probably reflect the situation in their own relationship that ended soon after the film was made. It is the last film Allen made with Farrow.Judy Davis played the role of her carrier practically stealing the film. I was shocked to find out that she received all possible Critics Awards that year and lost Best Supporting Oscar to Marisa Tomei. I love Tomei's performance in My Cousin Vinny (1992) but nomination itself would've been enough. Davis was the Best Supporting actress (I saw all films with nominated performances).

328215,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6302697042,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","Woody Allen's 1992 film ""Husbands and Wives"" was released around the time we first heard the words Soon-Yi, which is ironic considering the subject matter of the film. ""Husbands and Wives"" is billed as a comedy, but is more of a drama. There are a few jokes, but there's nothing incredibly funny in the film. The movie is told like a documentary, featuring interviews with the characters and handheld cinematography. Allen and Mia Farrow play Gabe and Judy Roth, a couple who have been married for ten years and think everything is well. Then their two friends Jack and Sally (Sydney Pollack & Judy Davis) announce they are getting divorced, which causes Gabe and Judy to question the validity of their own marriage. As Jack and Sally move on (with Jack getting a much hotter younger woman and Sally lusting after Michael, played by Liam Neeson), Gabe and Judy begin to move farther apart. Gabe, a college professor, finds himself falling for a 20-year-old student named Rain (Juliette Lewis) and Judy finds herself, also, lusting after Michael. The movie is 106 minutes, but a lot of stuff happens in the film. This is not one of Woody Allen's best; it's not in the top 5 anyway. It's overwrought and is not his most entertaining. The performances are very good, especially Farrow, Pollack, and Davis. Juliette Lewis, meanwhile, has echoes of Mariel Hemingway in ""Manhattan"" in her performance. The cinematography and mock-documentary style of the film gets old after a while, with the former getting headache-inducing after a while. ""Husbands and Wives"" is a good study of marriage and infidelity. One critic (I don't recall which one it was) said that ""Husbands and Wives"" seemed like Allen trying to come to grips with the Soon-Yi debacle, but the ending here is quite different. ""Husbands and Wives"" has its merits, it's demerits...But it's a worthy Woody Allen film that's definitely worth watching.GRADE: B-",4,Husbands & Wives,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1914,"['Woody', 'Allen', '1992', 'film', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'first', 'heard', 'words', 'Soon-Yi', 'ironic', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'billed', 'comedy', 'more', 'drama', 'are', 'few', 'jokes', 'nothing', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'film', 'movie', 'told', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'characters', 'handheld', 'cinematography', 'Allen', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'play', 'Gabe', 'Judy', 'Roth', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'ten', 'years', 'think', 'everything', 'well', 'Then', 'two', 'friends', 'Jack', 'Sally', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'announce', 'are', 'getting', 'divorced', 'Gabe', 'Judy', 'question', 'validity', 'own', 'marriage', 'Jack', 'Sally', 'move', 'Jack', 'getting', 'much', 'hotter', 'younger', 'woman', 'Sally', 'lusting', 'Michael', 'played', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Gabe', 'Judy', 'begin', 'move', 'farther', 'apart', 'Gabe', 'college', 'professor', 'falling', '20-year-old', 'student', 'named', 'Rain', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Judy', 'also', 'lusting', 'Michael', 'movie', '106', 'minutes', 'lot', 'stuff', 'happens', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'best', 'not', 'top', '5', 'anyway', 'overwrought', 'not', 'most', 'entertaining', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Farrow', 'Pollack', 'Davis', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'meanwhile', 'echoes', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'Manhattan', 'performance', 'cinematography', 'mock-documentary', 'style', 'film', 'old', 'while', 'former', 'getting', 'headache-inducing', 'while', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'good', 'study', 'marriage', 'infidelity', 'One', 'critic', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'one', 'was', 'said', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'seemed', 'Allen', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'Soon-Yi', 'debacle', 'ending', 'here', 'quite', 'different', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'merits', 'demerits', 'worthy', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

You see reaccuring themes and characters and conflicts. Allen's films are all amazing, though some of them I care for more than other's, they are all, in a sense, classic.In &quot;Husbands And Wives&quot; we in get into the lives of two couples in a docu-drama type of way. You feel like you're really watching these things unfold, like you're really part of the action. Afer many years together Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis are calling it quits, splitting up. They tell Woody Allen and his wife Mia Farrow, and they go nuts. &quot;How could this be happening?&quot; After their breakup Allen and Farrow start examining their own marriage and see that they also strive more in life. As Allen and Farrow's relationship is slowly crumbling, Pollack meets a young vegetarian zodiactic gymnist, and after much anxiety Davis meets Liam Neeson, a middle aged man who also just went through a serious relationship. As Allen falls in love with one of his students (Lewis) and Farrow falls for Neeson. We see relationships and dreams fall apart and new ones rise up.In the end this movie is a wonderful piece of art about marriage and how important it is, and if we truely believe we want to marry someone, we should think it out ALOT ahead of time. It is also about living a life worth living. Being alive and vivacious, and living each moment to the fullest. In the end you see that marital relationships aren't about romance and sex, it's about companionship.",4,"Wonderful, well acted drama",971740800,"10 17, 2000",2000,1565,"['When', 'watching', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'have', 'understand', 'movies', 'piece', 'together', 'beautiful', 'mosiac', 'see', 'reaccuring', 'themes', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'Allen', 'films', 'are', 'amazing', 'care', 'more', 'other', 'are', 'sense', 'classic.In', 'quot', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'quot', 'get', 'lives', 'two', 'couples', 'docu-drama', 'type', 'way', 'feel', ""'re"", 'really', 'watching', 'things', 'unfold', ""'re"", 'really', 'part', 'action', 'Afer', 'many', 'years', 'together', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'are', 'calling', 'splitting', 'up', 'tell', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'wife', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'go', 'nuts', 'quot', 'How', 'could', 'be', 'happening', 'quot', 'breakup', 'Allen', 'Farrow', 'start', 'examining', 'own', 'marriage', 'see', 'also', 'strive', 'more', 'life', 'Allen', 'Farrow', 'relationship', 'slowly', 'crumbling', 'Pollack', 'young', 'vegetarian', 'zodiactic', 'gymnist', 'much', 'anxiety', 'Davis', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'just', 'went', 'serious', 'relationship', 'Allen', 'love', 'one', 'students', 'Lewis', 'Farrow', 'Neeson', 'see', 'relationships', 'dreams', 'fall', 'apart', 'new', 'ones', 'rise', 'end', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'art', 'marriage', 'how', 'important', 'truely', 'believe', 'want', 'marry', 'someone', 'should', 'think', 'out', 'ALOT', 'ahead', 'time', 'also', 'about', 'living', 'life', 'living', 'Being', 'alive', 'vivacious', 'living', 'moment', 'fullest', 'end', 'see', 'marital', 'relationships', 'are', ""n't"", 'romance', 'sex', 'companionship']",N/A

I only saw it recently, and it's one of those films that technically would never fly, unless Allen was behind it.I enjoyed the partial-documentary sequences where the characters discuss their marriages, breakups, etc., and dark comedy that surrounds it all.Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis are that old married couple you think would stay together forever, but they're breaking up.  Woody finds himself strangely drawn to one of his writing students (Juliette Lewis makes the film!), who seems to get every man she meets on a string without even trying, Mia hooks up with Liam Neeson...there's a certain shallowness protrayed when it comes to people, and that really hit me.Perhaps as I was going through my own marriage breakup at the time I saw this awhile back, it struck chords with me I didn't think it would.  In any case, this is not a madcap Woody film.
