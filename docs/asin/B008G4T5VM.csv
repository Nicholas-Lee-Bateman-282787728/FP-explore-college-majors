This time around we learn the boys are being helped out by Maynard played by Pinhead himself, Doug Bradley. Bradley steals the movie and makes the three cannibals just a backdrop. He is the reason to watch this film besides the predictable good sex scenes and gore. The atmosphere like part 4 was creepy and well done. Basically there is a music fest going on but we rarely see that, so the town is empty expect for the teens, the sheriff, her husband (never explained if it was or not), Maynard, and a drunk. They ban together against the three cannibals who come to break out Maynard. I hope they keep the story going for the 6th installment with Bradley returning as well.

Why this is being called WRONG TURN 5 when all of the teens end up exactly where they intended to is beyond us, but that is the least of our worries. Declan O'Brien's script could have supplanted any other group of deranged killers and the film would have remained just as pointless and unnecessary as the last sequel. Once the audience has given up on the annoying lead characters, the only thing to look forward to is the gratuitous sex and gore, but even the effects department fails to deliver any memorable moments of bloody violence.

Apparently Wrong Turn did and so we now have Bloodlines.Set a couple of years after Bloody Beginnings, we find that our favorite trio of inbred cannibal brothers have now left the snow covered grounds of the asylum and have taken up residence in the cabin featured in the original Wrong Turn as well as having a ""normal"" human caregiver played by Doug Bradley (Hellraiser).  As usual we have the standard set up of partying college kids to supply an ample amount of sex, boobs, and Hot Plate Specials, a few cops, and one town drunk.  All of which takes place during West Virginia's Mountain Man Festival, an idea that is sadly never fully utilized.  Somehow all the action takes place in the darker, deserted part of town.Now, there are plenty of good kills and lots of nudity.  But my problem lies in the character played by Doug Bradley.  The man is seriously annoying.  Think of the old dude in Friday the 13th who kept saying ""You're all Dooomed!"" and amplify that to a twenty.  He's not menacing but every time he opened his mouth to let the sheriff and the kids know that his boys were coming for him and what they would do to them, I seriously wanted to jab a pair of chop sticks through my eardrums.  I get that these movies are all about the brothers and the victims are just meant to be that.  But Doug Bradley isn't one of them.  At best, he's a poor Jigsaw wannabe with his little mind games and traps.  Hopefully Declan O'Brien will kill him off in the next prequel as he hinted at earlier in the movie as one of the brothers clearly hates this guy and I, for one, can't blame him.  And how do I know there will be another prequel?

That, and stupidity on my part because I knew full well what this movie would be like and yet watched it anyway..........as I have the entire series (only kept the first one that started it all).  I wish I could say I was pleasantly surprised by this installment but it was pretty much business as usual.  At this point, they're following a worn-out formula; they don't deviate from it one iota.  On one hand, you have the three maniacs running around giggling.  On the other hand, you have the usual accounting of fodder.  (The body count was as high as the cast of non-hillbillies.)  The deaths weren't particularly inspired.  Apparently, at this stage of the game, this trio of nitwits can kill with impunity, with no one the wiser.

I agree with many of the other reviews on how stupid (for lack of a better word) the plotline was, but I guess like any fan I'm hoping this situatuion was created to get us through & past the mess that was #4. Please bring back the creative camera angles & characters that actually fight for survival. Take us back to the isolation and desperation we were given in the beginning of the Wrong Turn series.

But those movies had some point to them.  However small, however contrived, there was at least some plausible context for the suffering, and some anxiety and hope, rising and falling tensions, the possibility of justice or revenge--something.  ""Wrong Turn 5"" is an exercise in pointless, nihilistic suffering, full stop.If you have a taste for scenes of torture, I recommendTortured.

Here's what I noticed after the first viewing:Story:It's never made clear the time frame of this movie. WT4 was a prequel. After some long thought on this, I believe this is supposed to be after 4 and before 1. All 3 of these mutants are alive and well, so it doesn't make sense that this would be a continuation from 3.There is a reference from the older man Maynard that they aren't in an institution any longer. Maynard also refers to the 3 hillbilly freaks as ""my boys."" I never took him seriously, but after some consideration, maybe this man was really supposed to be their father. We don't know where this man came from or how he got hooked up with these 3. We just know that he ran into them at some point. We do see a computer screen at one point that would indicate that it is 2003, which would put this just months or even weeks before the original Wrong Turn.The story is very simple. Simply put, a group of victims gather at the sheriff's office one way or another and get picked off one at a time.Once the gang is more or less together at the sheriff's office, the sheriff tells everybody to stay together. They are trying to split them up to take them out one at a time. From that time forward everyone does their desperate best to try and split up. And when there's nobody else left that can leave, the sheriff herself wants to leave.This is all supposed to take place during a festival and the trailer leads you to believe that this is all wrapped around this festival, but you never get to see it. It's only an excuse to have an empty set. The sheriff was expecting a busy night of trouble from this festival and she didn't get one call or visit the entire night.I was confused as to how these 3 hillbillies could get hurt when smacked around by their 'father,' yet when one is shot in the leg, he doesn't flinch or even bleed. The one called 'Three finger' looks like he always did, but the other 2 don't resemble themselves from the other movies very much.The kills:Of course creativity is the thing with this and the movie does deliver some unique ways to kill people. I did feel that this time things had a bit of a ""Saw"" feel to it.The sex:Three sex scenes. They were very sensual rather than overly graphic. One had nothing to do with the story.The Special Effects:I didn't notice any CGI in this one. They went 'old school' and used actual animal guts. It gave a more realistic feel to it. Good call on this one.One particular kill was the first one where the woman is killed in the street. It looks like she has a day pack under her shirt. this is where the guts were stored for the scene. Really needed to do a better job on this scene.Maynard is shot in the shoulder. He's hurting pretty badly, but over time he just blows it off. Apparently he also has a self-cleaning shirt, as the blood gradually disappears as well.The set:This town sure looked like a small movie set. I was unimpressed. Low budget all the way here.The acting:Good acting all around. None of these actors are even American. You may pick up a slight accent from a line or 2 if you listen closely. Very impressive how well they acted and kept to an accurate American accent.Other random stuff:The ending of this movie looks a lot like the same location where #3 ended, at a hairpin turn. Pretty sure it's the very same place.Apparently people don't believe in using their brakes when something goes bad when driving.Nice BMWs don't have air bags.Greenbrier county, being a redneck area (I have lots of family still living there) has apparently become very open minded and elected a pretty woman to be county sheriff.The Extras:Few extras are included in the Blu-ray copy. No deleted scenes. You get to see how the killings were done and that the next installment may pick up not too far from where this one leaves off. That's about it.The disc itself:The picture quality was excellent and well presented with a nice menu system. There is a ton of movie trailers as well, which I could have done without.I give this one 2.5 stars. It's not far from WT3 in my mind. Actually 3 was better. There was real character development and drama going on in 3. This was more like a bunch of idiots trying to see how fast they can get themselves killed. So this would be the worst of the bunch.

I kept hoping that justice would prevail and every last one would be subject to the same tortures inflicted on their screaming victims. But the victims showed no brains about survival. The lone exception was the Sheriff Angela, and even she had been heavily armed. I suppose that different viewers react in different ways to monstrous celluloid evil. In my case it was anger.

This one is a sequel to number 4, still taking place before the original. Great concept, but the film had a lot of problems.Having said that, it was interesting to see who 'fathered' the hillbilly's. The sense of loyalty was profound, and the menacing ex-Pinhead actor was creepy. There was a sense in the film that it had difficulty progressing; a lot of the film was threatening banter between Doug Bradley and the Sheriff, and the festival was not a very good excuse for the people to gather in the town - after all, we hardly saw any footage of the festival.The characters were a bit weaker in this film, but it was terrifying at the end when the blind chick is found by the hillbilly crew - it is terrifying because we know what is going to happen to her after the film ends (based on the fact that we know the hillbilly's have a family in later years).Still, I did enjoy the film and I will watch it again (probably a few times).

1552868,A2UQF0BCL4I75O,B008G4T5VM,POD JAWS,"[0, 0]","Now I will admit that I am very accepting for the Wrong Turn movies, they are what most low-budget slashers aren't, creative... The deaths from parts 3 and 4 (even though part three it looked liked they tried to little on the CGI and part four it looked like they tried to hard on the CGI) were executed very well in very gruesome fashion... These films are basically like the cheaper version of Final Destination because you mainly only go to see them for the kills! This movie delivers the guts, blood, violence and imagination and it also had some decent acting (Doug Bradley)... I do however believe that this is the 2nd least gory of the wrong turn movies (the least gory being part one) but all in all it still kicked parts 3's ass!Plot: The Mountain Man Festival... a time to cherish the crazed and deformed hillbillies from 1817. But four uninvited guests have arrived and blood is being spilled left and right... now, in a Police Station (Which is where three quarters of the movie takes place!!) a group of people must stay alive to let the world know that their lives have taken a wrong turn towards death and that killer hillbillies are responsible for every poor lost soul that fed their cannibalistic hunger!Review: The action and terror in this movie was most definitely campy and cheesy but in a fun-spirited way which brings me to a couple of good things about this movie.... there was practically almost no CGI gore, fun characters, some decently tense scenes and one scene that cannot go without mention, you all know the mirror scare where a character looks into a mirror, opens it and then when that character closes it some figure appears and either A.) Scares them or B.) Kills them, just think of that in the opposite way! The Soundtrack was cool too; it had some very good bands such as The Cheetah Whores and my favorite The Blackout City Kids! The make up effects could've been a little better and the pacing could've been quicker but all in all this film was quite decent.Acting: It wasn't as bad as everyone says it is, I really didn't see one seriously bad actor in this movie and that says a lot!Gore: I really wished that there was a massacre seen involving the whole town, but unfortunately it doesn't quite happen that way! we get a chopped off finger, a lot of guts, severed limbs, a gory slashed throat, some chopped up peeps involving a giant bladed lawn mower, some severed ears, stabbings, an off-screen eye gouging scene, and more.... it was probably the least gory in my opinion but it still delivered and it was the best looking of Declan `O Brien's Three Wrong Turn Movies, mainly for the fact that they used a lot more practical gore effects than CGI!Bottom Line: It was better than part 3 but not as good as parts 1, 2 or 4, I honestly believe that there will be a 6th and most likely the series will continue, parts 1,4, and 5 are based in the same year (2003) but a lot can happen in a year!#1 Wrong Turn 2: Dead End#2 Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings#3 Wrong Turn#4 Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines#5 Wrong Turn 3: Left for DeadRated R for Strong Bloody Horror Violence, Sexuality, Language, and Drug ContentIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 7For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 3",3,Every Gore Hounds Guilty Pleasure Series Is Back!,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,3229,"['Now', 'will', 'admit', 'am', 'very', 'accepting', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'movies', 'are', 'what', 'most', 'low-budget', 'slashers', 'are', ""n't"", 'creative', 'deaths', 'parts', '3', '4', 'even', 'part', 'three', 'looked', 'liked', 'tried', 'little', 'CGI', 'part', 'four', 'looked', 'tried', 'hard', 'CGI', 'were', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'gruesome', 'fashion', 'films', 'are', 'basically', 'cheaper', 'version', 'Final', 'Destination', 'mainly', 'only', 'go', 'see', 'kills', 'movie', 'guts', 'blood', 'violence', 'imagination', 'also', 'had', 'decent', 'acting', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'do', 'however', 'believe', '2nd', 'least', 'gory', 'wrong', 'turn', 'movies', 'least', 'gory', 'being', 'part', 'one', 'still', 'kicked', 'parts', '3', 'ass', 'Plot', 'Mountain', 'Man', 'Festival', 'time', 'cherish', 'crazed', 'deformed', 'hillbillies', '1817', 'four', 'uninvited', 'guests', 'have', 'arrived', 'blood', 'being', 'spilled', 'left', 'right', 'now', 'Police', 'Station', 'Which', 'where', 'three', 'quarters', 'movie', 'place', 'group', 'people', 'must', 'stay', 'alive', 'let', 'world', 'know', 'lives', 'have', 'taken', 'wrong', 'turn', 'towards', 'death', 'killer', 'hillbillies', 'are', 'responsible', 'poor', 'lost', 'soul', 'fed', 'cannibalistic', 'hunger', 'Review', 'action', 'terror', 'movie', 'was', 'most', 'definitely', 'campy', 'cheesy', 'fun-spirited', 'way', 'couple', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'was', 'practically', 'almost', 'CGI', 'gore', 'fun', 'characters', 'decently', 'tense', 'scenes', 'one', 'scene', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'mention', 'know', 'mirror', 'scare', 'where', 'character', 'mirror', 'then', 'when', 'character', 'figure', 'A', 'B', 'just', 'think', 'opposite', 'way', 'Soundtrack', 'was', 'cool', 'too', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'bands', 'such', 'Cheetah', 'Whores', 'favorite', 'Blackout', 'City', 'Kids', 'make', 'up', 'effects', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'better', 'pacing', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quicker', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'decent.Acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'seriously', 'bad', 'actor', 'movie', 'lot', 'really', 'wished', 'was', 'massacre', 'seen', 'involving', 'whole', 'town', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'quite', 'happen', 'way', 'get', 'chopped', 'finger', 'lot', 'guts', 'severed', 'limbs', 'gory', 'slashed', 'throat', 'chopped', 'up', 'peeps', 'involving', 'giant', 'bladed', 'lawn', 'mower', 'severed', 'ears', 'stabbings', 'off-screen', 'eye', 'gouging', 'scene', 'more', 'was', 'probably', 'least', 'gory', 'opinion', 'still', 'delivered', 'was', 'best', 'looking', 'Declan', 'O', 'Brien', 'Three', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Movies', 'mainly', 'fact', 'used', 'lot', 'more', 'practical', 'gore', 'effects', 'CGI', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'was', 'better', 'part', '3', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'parts', '1', '2', '4', 'honestly', 'believe', 'will', 'be', '6th', 'most', 'likely', 'series', 'will', 'continue', 'parts', '1,4', '5', 'are', 'based', 'same', 'year', '2003', 'lot', 'can', 'happen', 'year', '1', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '2', 'Dead', 'End', '2', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '4', 'Bloody', 'Beginnings', '3', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '4', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '5', 'Bloodlines', '5', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '3', 'Left', 'DeadRated', 'R', 'Strong', 'Bloody', 'Horror', 'Violence', 'Sexuality', 'Language', 'Drug', 'ContentIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '7For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '3']",Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines

At some point the normal people trapped in a living nightmare actually do some serious fighting back.Not so in the last two entries of the series.But let's stick with WT5 and not get sidetracked with WT4.This movie features some of the dumbest victims EVER. Might as well just lay in the street waiting to be killed in some horrible way.It's hard to get into this movie when the people being attacked and picked off one by one run around like chickens with their heads cut off.So dumb as dirt teenaged idiots and a deputy and an equally retarded sheriff make the roster of soon to be dismembered or ripped apart by three mentally challenged unable to speak I doubt if they can even read hillbilly inbreds.The kills are creative and some of it is CGI no doubt,but they're still inventive and pretty neat.One completely unrelated boucing boobies sex scene is inserted (pun intended) and if they just continued with the softcore porn theme from that point on it probably would've been better. The girl is HOT but the scene itself last about thirty seconds...just the mandatory sex scene for a standard horror movie.SO like I said three mutant cannibals outsmart law enforcerment and a bunch of horny teens...I get the teens but really?

1552879,A1ZCMOW8Q6E71X,B008G4T5VM,"Ted E. Kissel ""Ted Kissel""","[0, 3]","Alright first off, I'm not going to get into how much of an epic failure this movie was with the plot and everything.  So lets just start out by saying the movie in my opinion was terrible because everyone pretty much dies.  So to the people who made the Wrong Turn Films let me start off by saying for the umteenth time THIS ISN'T THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING THE CANNIBALS/WEST VIRGINIA BACKWOODS HILLBILLIES KILLING EVERYONE DOES NOT MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THE GOOD GUYS LIKE IT DID IN THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING WITH LEATHERFACE AND HIS FAMILY.Now with that being said lets start off by getting into the plot of this movie then comparing it to the epic failure 4th installment of the Wrong Turn movie sequence since it is the only other installment of the Wong Turn movies where everyone dies.  The plot of this film is simple it takes place in a town known as Fair Lake located in Greenbrier County West Virginia home of everyones favorite backwoods redneck cannibal family.  Fair Lake according to the plot is a town that was established in 1814 and de-established in 1817 because all the cannibals who were the first people on the land before it was a town establishment and before West Virginia (originally part of Virginia) was even established as a state ate everyone and turned Fair Lake West Virginia (technically Fair Lake Virginia at the time) into a ghost town.  Basically every year outside the forest area of Fair Lake West Virginia there is a music festival known as the Mountain Man Festival and a group of 4 senior college kids and one college drop out (Billy) saying he's taking a break from school for longer then 2 semesters even though his parents don't know about it decide to camp out in the woods of Fair Lake West Virginia where the fearsome 3 sum of cannibals (3 finger, sawtooth, and one eye + Maynard (the old man in the first 2 wrong turns) live.  After being set up in a trap designed to crash the college students car on their way to the music festival dug by the cannibals involving the college students camping out kicking Maynard.  Right when the students are kicking Maynard after their car crashes from Maynard jumping in front of it when he's down and the cannibals are getting ready to strike their prey, the Greenbrier County Sherif and a few deputies show up and take the kids along with Maynard to jail for assault (mainly on Maynard) and illegal possession of drugs on the college kids.  And since Billy brought the drugs he takes full responsibility for them and the rest of the kids go to a near by motel.  Then the sherif finds out Maynard is guilty of multiple killing crimes and when she tries to report him to a higher police authority through radio the cannibals shut off all the power in the jail and motel.  Then Billy's girl friend Cruz brings him supper and is followed by one of Billy's college companions Julian.  Cruz gets killed by 3 finger on her way and Julian gets to the jail where the Sherif deputizes everyone in the jail cels (basically the 2 college kids + a drunk) to hold down the fort and get Maynard to a more secure facility due to death threats involving the other 3 cannibals from Maynard.Now comparing Wrong Turn 5 to Wrong Turn 4.First off Wrong Turn 4 was a worse movie, at least Wrong Turn 5 didn't go take place in this past decade (see prev review on Wrong Turn 4) even though it should have because Maynard is killed in the second Wrong Turn (created in 2007).  And the makers of Wrong Turn 5 didn't go take out all the fun of allot of parts in the plot like they did in Wrong Turn 4.  The creators of the film don't leave the viewer wondering how the cannibals got some of the things they did as they did in the fourth installment of Wrong Turn.  Plus the cannibals in Wrong Turn 5 acted more like killers rather then sissies like they did in Wrong Turn 4.  The good guys in Wrong Turn 5 didn't blow off killing the cannibals when they had the chance like the did in the 4th installment since they never really got a chance at killing the cannibals.  And at least Wrong Turn 5 Bloodbath/Bloodlines has a more suitable name and doesn't look like a poser film to the first wrong turn like the 4th installment did.However everyone dies in Wrong Turn 5 just like they did in the 4th installment and that's why it only gets one star.  But if you don't mind horror films where everyone dies and the bad guys win, you may like this movie even though it really should have taken place somewhere between 2004 & 2006.  However, in my opinion the creators of the Wrong Turn series of films with the 5th installment have shown pretty much a failure to make up for their god awful creation of the forth wrong turn, are getting pretty desperate for ideas, are starting to feel they should have left the wrong turn series at 3 films, and most importantly feeling like someone else needs to re-make their 4th and 5th installments of the Wrong Turn series.  Just like the people who made Starship Troopers feel about the second and third films they made (well I guess Starship Troopers 3 wasn't really that bad).  And just for the record, you can add a reporter, the sherif's boyfriend, and a deputy to the list of people who are killed in this film.",1,The Wrong Turn Franchise thus far needs to stick to 3

I enjoy over the top slasher films with a touch of Roger Corman. This one opens Corman style with a nude love scene. The film takes place in modern times some 30 years later after...? I'm not sure what, but now Maynard Odetts (Doug Bradley- ""Hellraiser"" Pinhead) has been there for 30 years but absent from the other films as a killer. I decided not to think too hard on this one and just enjoy the film. There must be more than one branch of cannibal killers in the area.The town of Fairlake, WV is having a 10 year annual festival celebrating the Hillbilly cannibal slasher...Seriously?People are in costume which allows our recluse gruesome threesome to enter town with knowledge of cell phone towers, phone lines, and electricity. The film gives literal meaning to ""Give me a hand"" and ""Lend me your ears."" The killings/torture was done in different and entertaining ways bordering on Troma style using real pig entrails. Clearly this film is not for everyone. But for those who like an 80's Troma style slasher film, you might want to check this one out.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Amy Lennox, corpse nudity, Bulgarian film actress Borisa Tutundjieva)",5,GIVE ME A HAND,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,1224,"['loved', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '4', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'rest', 'enjoy', 'top', 'slasher', 'films', 'touch', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'one', 'Corman', 'style', 'nude', 'love', 'scene', 'film', 'place', 'modern', 'times', '30', 'years', 'later', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'now', 'Maynard', 'Odetts', 'Doug', 'Bradley-', 'Hellraiser', 'Pinhead', 'been', '30', 'years', 'absent', 'other', 'films', 'killer', 'decided', 'not', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'one', 'just', 'enjoy', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'branch', 'cannibal', 'killers', 'area.The', 'town', 'Fairlake', 'WV', 'having', '10', 'year', 'annual', 'festival', 'celebrating', 'Hillbilly', 'slasher', 'Seriously', 'People', 'are', 'costume', 'recluse', 'gruesome', 'threesome', 'enter', 'town', 'knowledge', 'cell', 'phone', 'towers', 'phone', 'lines', 'electricity', 'film', 'literal', 'meaning', 'Give', 'hand', 'Lend', 'ears', 'killings/torture', 'was', 'done', 'different', 'entertaining', 'ways', 'bordering', 'Troma', 'style', 'using', 'real', 'pig', 'entrails', 'Clearly', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'who', 'like', '80', 'Troma', 'style', 'slasher', 'film', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Amy', 'Lennox', 'corpse', 'nudity', 'Bulgarian', 'film', 'actress', 'Borisa', 'Tutundjieva']",Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines
