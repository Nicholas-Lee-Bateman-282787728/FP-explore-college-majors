I now own 4 movies about the Titanic, including ""A Night to Remember - 1958"", ""Titanic - 1953"", ""The Titanic - 1996"", and of course ""Titanic - 1997 with Leonardo DeCaprio"".I rate all 4 movies with a 5.  They are all done remarkably well and each brings it's own interpritation to this trajic story.  For this version, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Peter Gallagher, Merilu Henner, George C. Scott, their acting is fantastic.  as always they deliver a stunning performance.  If you liked any one of the Titanic Movies, I recommend getting them all.",5,Pleasently surprised,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,606,"['had', 'idea', 'version', 'Titanic', 'existed', 'year', 'now', 'own', '4', 'movies', 'Titanic', 'including', 'Night', 'Remember', '1958', 'Titanic', '1953', 'Titanic', '1996', 'course', 'Titanic', '1997', 'Leonardo', 'DeCaprio', '.I', 'rate', '4', 'movies', '5', 'are', 'done', 'remarkably', 'well', 'own', 'interpritation', 'trajic', 'story', 'version', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Merilu', 'Henner', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'always', 'deliver', 'stunning', 'performance', 'liked', 'one', 'Titanic', 'Movies', 'recommend', 'getting']",N/A
191256,A1YB29BIDULEYE,1574924524,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[8, 8]","If you have even heard of this film, you already know it was hopelessly overshadowed by the Kate / Leonardo film.This film doesn't really have the artistic beauty of the Kate/Leonardo film. And generally speaking the characters are not as memorable, or even likable.Anyone who knows anything about this subject knows that a so called unsinkable ship is loaded with famous people as well as some lower class people. There are some interesting interactions. Then the ship hits an ice berg, and then there aren't enough life boats. Who will live, and who will die?But I will say this for it. If you're after a movie that is a bit more historical than the Kate/Leonardo version, then you may appreciate this. There very well may have been a woman on board who murdered her own child and kidnapped the child of the family she was working for. (Her actions also seal the fate of her employers and their daughter. The one 1st class child who did NOT survive.)John Aster's request to go with his wife and the refusal is there.A small part of survivor R. Norris Williams is there.All in all, it depends whether you are after a love story or history. This one does not have the lush or artistic beauty the Kate/Leonardo version has. But I don't get the impression this movie was trying for that. It was after nailing down more history.I will say George C. Scott was a good captain who explains that the Titanic foreshadowed its fate even with its name. (Beings who challenged the rule of Zeus and were defeated and punished.)I will also grant this version makes Bruce Ismay far more redeemable. He helps many people into life boats before his escape. And his sorrow is evident.The less I say about Mari Lu Henner, the better. As Molly Brown goes, I find Kathy Bates made her a lot more likable.This film also brings up the subject of the ship 'The Californian.' Was this ship guilty of leaving the Titanic to die? History doesn't know for sure, and it probably never will be exactly sure. But what history DOES KNOW is that the Californian TRIED to warn Titanic of the ice up ahead, and the Titanic's wireless operator Jack Phillips RUDELY screamed: ""SHUT UP!"" (It's shown in this film.)I'll say this in defense of the Californian. In a question and answers book, I read that the Californina was trapped in a field of ice. And if they had went immediately to the Titanic, they would have been burdened with steering around the dark in a field of ice. And by then, most of the Titanic's doomed crew would have already frozen to death.The best way to conclude is that no one watches the Kate/Leonardo film for history. And probably no one watches this version for the love story.",3,"Well, It's A Bit More Historical",1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,2667,"['have', 'even', 'heard', 'film', 'already', 'know', 'was', 'hopelessly', 'overshadowed', 'Kate', '/', 'Leonardo', 'film.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'artistic', 'beauty', 'Kate/Leonardo', 'film', 'generally', 'speaking', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'memorable', 'even', 'likable.Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'subject', 'so', 'called', 'unsinkable', 'ship', 'loaded', 'famous', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'lower', 'class', 'people', 'are', 'interesting', 'interactions', 'Then', 'ship', 'ice', 'berg', 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'life', 'boats', 'Who', 'will', 'live', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'will', 'say', ""'re"", 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'historical', 'Kate/Leonardo', 'version', 'then', 'may', 'appreciate', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'woman', 'board', 'who', 'murdered', 'own', 'child', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'family', 'was', 'working', 'actions', 'also', 'seal', 'fate', 'employers', 'daughter', 'one', '1st', 'class', 'child', 'who', 'did', 'NOT', 'survive', 'John', 'Aster', 'request', 'go', 'wife', 'refusal', 'there.A', 'small', 'part', 'survivor', 'R.', 'Norris', 'Williams', 'there.All', 'are', 'love', 'story', 'history', 'one', 'not', 'have', 'lush', 'artistic', 'beauty', 'Kate/Leonardo', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'was', 'nailing', 'down', 'more', 'history.I', 'will', 'say', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'was', 'good', 'captain', 'who', 'Titanic', 'foreshadowed', 'fate', 'even', 'name', 'Beings', 'who', 'challenged', 'rule', 'Zeus', 'were', 'defeated', 'punished', 'will', 'also', 'grant', 'version', 'Bruce', 'Ismay', 'far', 'more', 'redeemable', 'many', 'people', 'life', 'boats', 'escape', 'sorrow', 'evident.The', 'less', 'say', 'Mari', 'Lu', 'Henner', 'better', 'Molly', 'Brown', 'find', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'likable.This', 'film', 'also', 'up', 'subject', 'ship', 'Californian', 'Was', 'ship', 'guilty', 'leaving', 'Titanic', 'die', 'History', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'history', 'DOES', 'KNOW', 'Californian', 'TRIED', 'warn', 'Titanic', 'ice', 'up', 'ahead', 'Titanic', 'wireless', 'operator', 'Jack', 'Phillips', 'RUDELY', 'screamed', 'SHUT', 'UP', 'shown', 'film', ""'ll"", 'say', 'defense', 'Californian', 'question', 'answers', 'book', 'read', 'Californina', 'was', 'trapped', 'field', 'ice', 'had', 'went', 'immediately', 'Titanic', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'burdened', 'steering', 'dark', 'field', 'ice', 'then', 'most', 'Titanic', 'doomed', 'crew', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'frozen', 'death.The', 'best', 'way', 'conclude', 'one', 'Kate/Leonardo', 'film', 'history', 'probably', 'one', 'version', 'love', 'story']",N/A
191257,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,1574924524,Byron Kolln,"[16, 16]","The 1996 Hallmark miniseries of TITANIC was unfortunate in that it ended up being largely overshadowed by James Cameron's 1997 big-screen blockbuster (by the time the miniseries was aired in the UK and Australia, James Cameron's version had well and truly exploded onto the scene).  This was a pity, as the Hallmark version has many things in it's favour.Catherine Zeta-Jones and Peter Gallagher head a star-studded international cast, and the adaptation succeeds in blending five different stories into the narrative.  Perhaps most importantly this version depicts a real-life passenger called Alice Cleaver (played by Felicity Waterman) who attempted to kidnap the baby of her employers when the boat began to sink (leaving the family to search for the child until all the lifeboats had departed, thus sealing their fate).  At the time of this miniseries, Catherine Zeta-Jones was at the cusp of Hollywood superstardom.  She looks ravishing as Isabella Paradine, who rekindles an affair with her first beau Wynn Park (Peter Gallagher).  Also in this miniseries, we meet in greater detail John Jacob Astor (Scott Hylands) and his pregnant young second wife Madeline (Janne Mortil).  The affair of Astor and Madeline was one of the biggest scandals of the period and it's great to have them as prominent characters in this version.  The younger romance is provided by thief Jamie (Mike Doyle) and Danish convert Aase (Sonsee Neu-Ahray).  No version of TITANIC would be complete without the ebullient and ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown (Marilu Henner plays her with enough spirit and spunk to make Debbie Reynolds proud and Kathy Bates pale).  And the villain of the piece is thieving steward Simon Doonan (performed with oily relish by Tim Curry).  A flavour of classic Hollywood is provided by George C. Scott as the Captain and Eva Marie Saint as the selfish Hazel Foley.The romance of Bella (Zeta-Jones) and Wynn (Gallagher) is a captivating and moving one, played with style and elegance, and I consider it far more effective than the romance in the James Cameron spectacle.  True, the special effects are lacking in this version but the dramatics and acting more than compensate.  A fantastic production and one I revisit often.  Originally shown in two parts.  With Tamsin Kelsey, Eric Keenleyside, Malcolm Stewart, Roger Rees, Harley Jane Kozak, Kevin Conway, Matt Hill and Barry Pepper.",4,one of the better versions,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,2388,"['1996', 'Hallmark', 'miniseries', 'TITANIC', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'largely', 'overshadowed', 'James', 'Cameron', '1997', 'big-screen', 'blockbuster', 'time', 'miniseries', 'was', 'aired', 'UK', 'Australia', 'James', 'Cameron', 'version', 'had', 'well', 'truly', 'exploded', 'scene', 'was', 'pity', 'Hallmark', 'version', 'many', 'things', 'favour.Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'head', 'star-studded', 'international', 'cast', 'adaptation', 'blending', 'five', 'different', 'stories', 'narrative', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'version', 'real-life', 'passenger', 'called', 'Alice', 'Cleaver', 'played', 'Felicity', 'Waterman', 'who', 'attempted', 'kidnap', 'baby', 'employers', 'when', 'boat', 'began', 'sink', 'leaving', 'family', 'search', 'child', 'lifeboats', 'had', 'departed', 'thus', 'sealing', 'fate', 'time', 'miniseries', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'was', 'cusp', 'Hollywood', 'superstardom', 'ravishing', 'Isabella', 'Paradine', 'who', 'affair', 'first', 'beau', 'Wynn', 'Park', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Also', 'miniseries', 'meet', 'greater', 'detail', 'John', 'Jacob', 'Astor', 'Scott', 'Hylands', 'pregnant', 'young', 'second', 'wife', 'Madeline', 'Janne', 'Mortil', 'affair', 'Astor', 'Madeline', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'scandals', 'period', 'great', 'have', 'prominent', 'characters', 'version', 'younger', 'romance', 'provided', 'thief', 'Jamie', 'Mike', 'Doyle', 'Danish', 'convert', 'Aase', 'Sonsee', 'Neu-Ahray', 'version', 'TITANIC', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'ebullient', 'unsinkable', 'Molly', 'Brown', 'Marilu', 'Henner', 'enough', 'spirit', 'spunk', 'make', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'proud', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'pale', 'villain', 'piece', 'thieving', 'steward', 'Simon', 'Doonan', 'performed', 'oily', 'relish', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'flavour', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'provided', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Captain', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'selfish', 'Hazel', 'Foley.The', 'romance', 'Bella', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Wynn', 'Gallagher', 'captivating', 'moving', 'one', 'played', 'style', 'elegance', 'consider', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'romance', 'James', 'Cameron', 'spectacle', 'True', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'lacking', 'version', 'dramatics', 'acting', 'more', 'compensate', 'fantastic', 'production', 'one', 'revisit', 'often', 'Originally', 'shown', 'two', 'parts', 'Tamsin', 'Kelsey', 'Eric', 'Keenleyside', 'Malcolm', 'Stewart', 'Roger', 'Rees', 'Harley', 'Jane', 'Kozak', 'Kevin', 'Conway', 'Matt', 'Hill', 'Barry', 'Pepper']",N/A

191259,A1F8T3K3VAJIUO,1574924524,"Didrick Namtvedt ""music lover""","[7, 9]","I picked this DVD up in a videostore the other day and got really curious. Having seen James Cameron's blockbuster movie from 1997 and noticing that stars like Catherine Zeta-Jones were on the role list here, I had pretty high expectations about this one. But alas, I watched it without being too overly impressed. The special effects are laughable, you can easily tell that the ocean and iceberg is computer made and some of the sailing scenes even look painted at one point. Plot-wise, it goes real in depth with many of the characters and we get to really know what they're all about. We just don't stick to one couple that bore our asses off (Kate and Leo, yawn). No depressing James Horner background music a la &quot;The Rose&quot; either. The raping scene was a bit off the edge but it isn't as bad as people claim. I've seen worse things in other movies. The sinking of the ship was a huge disappointment, we only see images of the people in the lifeboats with a terrified look on their faces and just small seconds of the ship sinking and breaking in two. At this point of the movie, James Cameron does a much better job actually focusing on the ship sinking and breaking in two and paid less attention to the people in the lifeboats.If you're fascinated by Titanic like me, then this movie is worth checking out but if you also want a great movie experience that makes you feel as if you were on the boat the night of the sinking, then James Cameron's version is the one to go for. Seeing that this was a movie produced for TV, it makes sense they didn't spend that much money on it but don't let that put you off from watching it, you will enjoy it.",3,"Better plot than Cameron, but not convincing enough",1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,1660,"['picked', 'DVD', 'up', 'videostore', 'other', 'day', 'got', 'really', 'curious', 'Having', 'seen', 'James', 'Cameron', 'blockbuster', 'movie', '1997', 'noticing', 'stars', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'were', 'role', 'list', 'here', 'had', 'pretty', 'high', 'expectations', 'one', 'alas', 'watched', 'being', 'too', 'overly', 'impressed', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'laughable', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', 'ocean', 'iceberg', 'computer', 'made', 'sailing', 'scenes', 'even', 'look', 'painted', 'one', 'point', 'Plot-wise', 'real', 'depth', 'many', 'characters', 'get', 'really', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'about', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'stick', 'one', 'couple', 'bore', 'asses', 'Kate', 'Leo', 'yawn', 'No', 'depressing', 'James', 'Horner', 'music', 'la', 'quot', 'Rose', 'quot', 'raping', 'scene', 'was', 'bit', 'edge', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'claim', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'things', 'other', 'movies', 'sinking', 'ship', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'only', 'see', 'images', 'people', 'lifeboats', 'terrified', 'look', 'just', 'small', 'seconds', 'ship', 'sinking', 'breaking', 'two', 'point', 'movie', 'James', 'Cameron', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'actually', 'focusing', 'ship', 'sinking', 'breaking', 'two', 'paid', 'less', 'attention', 'people', 'lifeboats.If', ""'re"", 'fascinated', 'Titanic', 'then', 'movie', 'checking', 'out', 'also', 'want', 'great', 'movie', 'experience', 'feel', 'were', 'boat', 'night', 'sinking', 'then', 'James', 'Cameron', 'version', 'one', 'go', 'Seeing', 'was', 'movie', 'produced', 'TV', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'that', 'much', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

The acting in this film was excellent and was the reason I became so engrossed in the movie.  It focuses a little more on the steerage passengers and their plight as well as passengers in first class. I really got emotionally involved and I rarely lose myself in a movie.  I would put this right up there with A Night To Remember as far as far as its impact.. It affected me in very much the same way.  It was a pretty intense experience  although there were a few lighter moments.  The real life Alice Cleaver who traveled with the Allisons was not the child murderer as was portrayed in this movie, however,  the gal playing her was good and brought an even more chilling and spooky aspect to the film..

It is the best Catherine Zeta Jones performance I've seen. Very believable and she looked lovely.  I dislike Peter Gallager but liked him in this movie.  I didn't care at all for the gratuitous violence of the rape scene and can't imagine why they put it in. There are two things I particularly liked about this movie. One was that they included the well documented fact that the California just sat there within spitting distance  and did nothing to check to see what was going on -why all the flairs? - shut down their wireless.  The other was that they continued the story to show  the rescued passengers  on the Carpethia and showed some arriving home.  I thought the scenes of the married couple traveling with their two children with the crazy nurse showed without rubbing our noses in it that most women  were so dependent on their husbands back then that they never had an original thought of their own.

My brother and I both agreed that here was one of the most beautiful women we had ever seen. However, even her loveliness couldn't hoist this loser out of the water--ye [...]!That first time, I turned it on practically at the end; the ship had already sunk and the passengers rescued onto the Carpathia. Catherine Z-J was going from character to character, berating them for various ways in which they had failed to be decent during the recent crisis. I thought this seemed a trifle sanctimonious on her part, and then we learned that she herself had been having an affair while on board, so she was a fine one to talk that way to others. Then she went on to appear in the next Zorro picture, and we felt like talent scouts for having spotted this star quality woman even in a turkey.Well, eventually I did see the whole movie. It is mighty silly in places--there's an Irish nanny who has a premonition of what's going to happen, but evidently was already implicated in the death of her previous charge--uh oh, watch out for her! Then George C. Scott goes about in an extremely tight uniform as the luckless Captain. He seems disgusted that the ship will sink; probably the real-life captain had feelings a bit stronger than that. Marilu Henner's rendition of Molly Brown makes you wish that she had not proved so unsinkable after all.And cheapest of all, the special effects of the actual sinking of the ship are virtually nonexistent.

Tim Curry has a truly evil role, his usual role! He was brilliant, although his raping of a young Danish girl was criticised, for it maybe being inappropriate? But I'm sure these things happened in those days, and it's not as graphic as people make it out to be. It's a gritty touch of realism, and people who say it wasn't necessary, or inappropriate, don't realise that it happens: then & now.Everyone, including me, raved about James Cameron's Titanic when it was released at the cinemas (I saw it twice, and both times, needed to use the little girl's room within an hour of the film starting!) Watching it back on DVD, it doesn't have the same effect, as does this - even though it was a TV mini series, and never released at the cinema. You can tell the ship scenes weren't up to scratch, and looked particularly dodgy and laughable at times. Both films differ, as Cameron's version paid a lot more attention to the ship sinking, where as this, you get one shot of it breaking in two, and the rest is a semi-abstract way of the passengers in the water and in the lifeboats. There's also an epilogue to this movie, where everything turns out right in the end, and although the Cameron version was similar, it was tinged with sadness. At least this movie included some of the Carpathia drama, but even there the story was severely distorted. According to this movie, the Carpathia was half-way there before Captain Rostron realized they had to go faster. And the mystery 'ghost' ship, whih was 10 miles away, and could have rescued the Titanic passengers, but they were never able to contact her. Although the Cameron version does show Thomas Andrews a lot; he's simply not featured in this.There are some flaws in this, with Smith getting a lot of the lines that Thomas Andrews should have said, but he wasn't featured. It was Thomas Andrews, not Capt. Smith. who explained the ship's architectural drawings and the effect of the inrush of seawater to the officers. There was no evidence this was Captain Smith's last voyage - only speculation and Ismay did not descend to the boiler room ordering more boilers be lit. The reason the lookouts did not have binoculars was because they had been removed at Southampton.The water-tight doors were closed before, not after the collision. And with both versions, Murdoch shoots himself, and his family still claims he would never have done that. We'll never know, so stop complaining about it!What annoys me about some reviewers, is they complain about the 'love stories' in these movies and claim that people aren't really interested in the history or the actual facts, so need a love story to amuse them. As a HUGE fan of the Titanic, I totally disagree, and would like quite happily to slap these reviewers.The sub-plot with the Allisons' maid was interesting - the maid did, in fact, take the baby and get in a life boat, without the mother's consent, causing the parents and their little girl to roam the ship looking for them until it went down. Whether the maid was actually crazy was anybody's guess, but it was an interesting choice of plot in this film. If you get the Titanic book 'Women & Children', it gets into more detail about this particular story. The young Allison girl was the only first-class child to die on the Titanic.I still haven't seen some of the older Titanic movies, A Night To Remember and SOS Titanic, but to go with this and the Cameron DVD, I have a cartoon version too! And the movie Britannic, which I only bought cos it's related to it, only watched half an hour of it, and couldn't get into it.

Yawn, snort, and thud! Dreadful, simply dreadful. Poor George C. Scott is wasted despite trying to channel Patton from time to time. Catherine Zee-Jay has little to do except look woeful or seductive by turn. The soap opera melodrama surrounding her invented character is the central subplot to this horribly dull revisiting of the Titanic's fateful voyage. There are several other invented or elaborated intrigues woven around some exceptionally shoddy computer animation, most of which are poorly written, badly acted, and largely unbelieveable. There has never been a more hillbilly portrayal of ""the Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (Marilu Henner) -- I half-expected her brother Yosemite Sam to pop up. Tim Curry's thoroughly corrupt character (how did this chap ever get hired by the White Star line?) becomes more cartoonlike in his evil as the movie proceeds. And as other critics have noted, his rape of a passenger is more than a little gratuitous. The producers have no shame.There are a certain number of similarities to Cameron's blockbuster that give one pause -- both of these were in production at about the same time, yes? So who was ""influenced"" by who? And how?I have a hard time understanding why so many here think so highly of this turkey.

I've just recently seen this version of the Titanic...and let me tell you...it put James Cameron to shame.The acting in this was amazing, especially Tim Curry, Catherine Zeta Jones, and George C. Scott, and the woman who played Molly Brown.Despite the fact that many people are disgusted by the rape scene, I don't see what's so graphic about it. It's true that it was unnecessary, but look at whats on TV nowadays! Hello people...they play a lot worse than that on the damn Disney channel.Tim Curry's character is the kind one loves to hate, and he does an amazing job for the part. It's true it seems he's always typecast as a villian, but this is the most purely evil role he's played yet! As much as I tried to hate his character...I couldn't...knowing that it was really Tim.You're guarenteed to love this movie, I believe it has set that standard for all Titanic movies, despite what many will say.
