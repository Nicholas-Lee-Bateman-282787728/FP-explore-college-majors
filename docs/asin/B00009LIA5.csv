754120,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00009LIA5,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 2]","As far as straight to video sequels that barely raise one's awareness of it's very existence goes, this sequel to the 1986 film, is better than expected. It doesn't set any new trends or build upon what happened in the original, but it makes up for it for being a fun, albeit, generic little road thriller. Instead of trying something new and creating new surprises and thrills and chills, the movie basically follows the original's blue print to the max. Not only that, but pretty much every other road type thriller film. It doesn't really have a persona or presence of it's own, just parts of other movies all rolled into one. C. Thomas Howell returns as Jim Halsey, from the original movie. He is now a slightly bent cop who is still plagued by the trauma he experienced when picking up a psycho hitchiker years ago. After an event in the opening minutes, Jim decides to take to off to a friends house for a little getaway. He brings along his new girlfriend(played by the lovely Kari Wuhrer)for the ride. While driving in the middle of nowhere in a storm, Jim picks up, at his girlfriend's urging, a suspicious hitchiker also named Jim(Jake Busey). What results is the usual shenanigans when Jim and his girl find themselves trapped in the psycho hitcher's little game. You know the drill. Busey was a good casting choice for the role. There were some rumors going around in the film's early stages that Rutger Hauer was possibly returning. Sadly, he did not. Then again, there would be no way he could. Instead, we get Busey. He doesn't have the commanding presence that Hauer had, but he has a certain presence all his own. He is an agreeable bad guy that gets the point across, but just can't match Hauer. With his dad being who he is, I see Busey having a long career as the whack job. His character here is an enigma. There are lines here and there where it seems they are alluding to the fact that he might be somebody. Wuhrer's character even asks, but never gets an answer. We don't really know who he is, and it's kind of frustrating. Which makes me wonder if there will be a ""Hitcher 3"" that will give more of an explanation. C. Thomas Howell returns to the role as Jim, and his acting is pretty wooden. It was nice to see him, and he does have a better presence as he has gotten on in years, but his acting leaves a lot to be desired. This leaves us with Wuhrer. She has sort of made a name for herself as a made for cable/straight to video B movie type actress, and I don't see her breaking out of that entrapment. That being said, she does a pretty good job here in her role. She makes a pretty solid butt kicking heroine. If only she got better material that rised above just being another straight to video piece of fodder. The movie isn't all bad. It's shot well, and the cinematography is nice. It is supposed to be Texas, but was really shot in Canada. And they did a great job making it seem like Texas. There are a few pretty good scenes and moments, but with re-creating the torn between two trucks scenario, and Jim having flashbacks to the original, it appears that the movie is hanging onto it's respected predecessor instead of moving on into it's own thing. It also feels like it has way more kills than needed, which makes it feel like a typical shoot 'em up bloodbath. With a more solid foundation, clearer view of plot, and a little more surprises, the sequel could of been a lot more than it is. Still, like I said, it's a decent little road thriller for what it is.

754124,A2OSERGXBYMPJ0,B00009LIA5,C. T. Mikesell,"[1, 1]","Comparing this sequel to the original film is like comparing a sirloin steak to a New York strip. It's no contest, even though nine times out of ten you'd be perfectly content to enjoy the lesser cut of beef. (Of course after the finale in this movie you might swear off red meat entirely for awhile.)If you haven't seen the original recently, you'll probably find this movie an adequate use of ninety minutes. I have the first movie in my stack of to-be-watched films, but when I came across this title I thought I'd give it a chance on its own merits. It didn't disappoint.Jake Busey is a different breed of hitcher. Where Hauer kept it icy and menacing, Busey goes nutjob from the word go. It's not a bad performance, but it's different enough to throw you if you were expecting more of what you got in the first movie. There *are* several scenes borrowed from the first movie, but they are significantly different as well - for instance (and this isn't a spoiler, it's featured on the disc packaging) the truck-stretching scene is repeated, but with The Hitcher as victim this time around.The cinematography is gorgeous, but this ultimately works against the film: instead of creating a sense of isolation, the broad vistas could double as Tourist Board video, calling out ""Come to Texas"" (or Calgary, as the case may be). Also working against the film is an over-reliance on genre clich&eacute;s: the slow camera moves while the spooky music builds, the framing tightly on the hero(ine) so you can pull back and reveal the killer, the killer playing possum so the ending can be stretched by a scene or two.If you're in the mood for a middling suspense/horror film, you could do much worse than this movie.

754130,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00009LIA5,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[2, 2]","C. Thomas Howell reprises his role as Jim Halsey in this sequel to the original ""Hitcher"".  Still haunted by earlier events, Jim and his girlfriend Maggie (Kari Wuhrer) decide to confront his demons once and for all.  After being relieved of his duties as a police officer for using excessive force in breaking up a child abduction, Jim calls his friend Captain Ethridge, who helped him out earlier.  The Captain convinces Jim and Maggie to come back to Texas so Jim can confront his feelings and erase his anxieties. Jim has never told his secret to Maggie, so she doesn't know why he keeps having flashbacks and is acting so strangely.However, upon reaching their destination, the same sequence of events starts all over again, as Maggie forcefully convinces Jim to pick up a hitchhiker along the same strech of roadway that Jim had travelled 15 years earlier.  The apparent survivor of an accident, Jack (Jake Busey) thumbs a ride from Jim and Maggie.  Unknown to them at the time, Jake is the one who caused the accident.  Soon, Jim and Maggie are fighting for their lives against another psychotic hitchhiker.  Who will survive?I thought the first movie was better than this one.  I do think that C. Thomas Howell, Jake Busey, and Kari Wuhrer do good jobs in their roles, but the story is all too predictable (although there are some unexpected happenings).  Even the scene with the victim tied between the truck and trailer is revised from the first movie.  There's not much originality in this film, either.  It relies too much on the first movie.  I did like the flashbacks to the first film, though.  The glaring omission from this movie is Rutger Hauer's amazing portrayal as the hitcher.

He was not at all scary-he was just too predictable.  The movie did not explain the connection between  Busey and Hauer (from the original) - and I thought that was a major part missing-C Thomas Howell is a great B movie actor and is fit for movies like this but---he was killed off way too early in this film and from that time on the film kind of went down hill after that.

754134,A15R0AOY2BQAPF,B00009LIA5,Matthew Skidmore,"[7, 9]","With what seems like the most unnecessary sequel in recent cinema history, THE HITCHER 2: I'VE BEEN WAITING is ''finally'' here. Coming from out of nowhere, this film not only doesn't need to be made, but actually succeeds in making you know that it doesn't need to be made.The story picks up years after the first movie closed, as Jim Halsey (played by C.Thomas Howell, who has grown up to resemble a rejected member of Motley Crue) is still haunted by the nightmare that was Rutger Hauer. He is now a veteran cop, undergoing serious stress and anxiety. In an effort to get his life back on track, he seeks out his police mentor buddy (Jeffrey DeMunn's character from the original, here played by someone else). However, to get to him, he must travel down that same stretch of road from the original movie, where he first encountered Hauer's malevolent villain.En route, he takes his girlfriend Maggie (Kari Wuhrer in serious direct-to-video fatigue), who is blissfully unaware of Jim's past. Together, they travel down that same dusty highway, with Howell sweating and moaning about 'how they cannot stop for anything, must keep driving' etc. However, within 5 minutes of the running time, up pops Jake Busey - decked out on long black overcoat, wild blonde hair and carrying a rather big gun. Obviously, Howell flips his lid after Busey whispers in his ear 'I've been waiting for you' and then all hell breaks loose.Well, I say 'all hell'. If you call people running away from a guy who looks about as frightening as a grinning children's entertainer at a kid's 5th birthday party, then by all means be terrified. However, I doubt it. To be fair to Busey, he is thoroughly entertaining - with his wild looks and goofy antics just about making the film bearable. Its just coming after Hauer's icy and twisted portrayal in the original film, Busey has to work EXTRA hard to get any real licks in. Returning 'star' Howell valiantly strives to rise above the mediocre script, and at some points he succeeds in exhibiting the right amount of stress and paranoia, but even he is flogging a dead horse in this dreadfully routine TV movie.Director Louis Morneau has made some decent movies in the past. With the high-octane action comedy MADE MEN to the fun time travel thriller RETRO-ACTIVE, he has delivered excellent movies on shoe-string budgets, allowing his style and sharp sense of pacing drag you through even the dumbest of scripts. However, on this occasion his directorial style works against him. With this kind of film, mood is the key. The first movie had it in spades - lush cinematography, expert editing and a dark screenplay that set it apart from the rest of the 80s slasher led dreck. On this sequel however, Morneau shoots it like it were an action film. With his camera zooming all over the place and cutting scenes within an inch of their TV movie life, he never allows the viewer to become engrossed in the proceedings and care about any of the characters. Which is a shame as the cast are making an effort, even if the 'dime store, seen it all before' script isn't.Universal's disc has NO extras. Not even a trailer. Which hurts even more, after you've seen the movie. The picture and audio quality are however, fine. With cinematographer George Maroodian's stylish (if fast moving) camerawork exhibited in full.So, to sum up - after seeing the original film, you already know that there isn't a need for a sequel to THE HITCHER. That movie had a beginning, a middle and an end. Why Universal decided to make an awful sequel to a classic 80s thriller is anybody's guess. And, why I had the curiosity to spend [money]to see this unnecessary exercise in tedium is also, anybody's guess. I just hope you can learn from my mistake, keep your money firmly in your pocket and stick with the original.",1,Drive on.

I do suggest fans of the original to watch this and make your own judgement. This film is kind of hard to rate. Jake Busey is very charasmatic as The Hitcher but Rutger Hauer was The Man! The sequel suggests him to be immortal a la Michael Myers/Jason Vorhees. And, he could appear to be anyone ordinary but somehow he always turns up! It's an interesting concept. However, in most peoples mind The Hitcher could only be Rutger!!Having C. Thomas Howell back as Jim Halsey was very cool but IMO the script for him basically sucked. In the first film he showed a lot more swiftness and will to survive moreso than this one. After what he went through in the first film you would think he'd have better intelligence in dealing with The Hitcher! And like the other review on here said, kinda scared but not petrified out of his mind!! I thought it was being a bit disrespectful to the first film to have his character portrayed the way he was. Kari was great as the girlfriend, though. She had the best performance of the film.I don't know if they can play off the mistakes in this one and somehow put together an improved part 3.

end, it was still chilling, I had high hopes for this one, especially since C.Thomas Howell decided to return, only the first 20 minutes are good, In this one, 15 years has passed since the first film's events, Jim Halsey(Howell) has for the most part put that nightmare behind him, he is now cop himself & leads a pretty normal life with his girlfriend (Kari Wuhrer) who is always nice to look at, but keeps having recurring flashbacks especially after a undercover situation goes wrong & he is suspended on his job, he contacts Captain Esteridge who helped him in the first film, & he suggest that he come see him so he can face his fear & move on which means to do so, he would have to travel the same road, Halsey reluctantly does, with Wuhrer, & what follows is Halsey's paranoid behavior as he refuses to stop, even for a wrecked mobile home, it is understandable why he is paranoid, but soon they see a stranger(Jake Busey) who Wuhrer forces Halsey to pick up, Busey's demeanor is that of Rutger Hauer's Hitcher in the first film, & Halsey immediately forces him out at gunpoint, I really felt this film would take elements of 1997's ""Breakdown"" & have Howell & Wuhrer out wit Busey, it seems that way at first, but instead the filmakers decided to rip off the original, & to add insult to injury, kill off Howell's Halsey leaving Wuhrer to fend for herself, as she like him in the original is framed for all of Busey's mayhem, as kills anyone & everyone & manages to make her look like the culprit, this one even suggest that Busey is the same character that Hauer played, come on, in the original, Hauer's Hitcher is blasted by a shotgun at least 3 times by Halsey at the end, no way was he coming back, but this tries to suggest that, when what they should have done is have Busey somehow related to Hauer, but no they insult our intelligence with this whacked out theory, that he somehow survived, yeah right, Hauer must feel so honored, I would have much rather seen Howell & Wuhrer play cat & mouse with Busey, that, at least would have brought back the suspense element, & Howell's Halsey facing his demons for sure, why Howell agreed to this script is beyond me, I'm sure Hauer was offered to return as well, it is easy to see why he might have passed, Howell should have too, or at least demanded a better story, Wuhrer & Busey do their best to play off each other's emotion, but their talent is completely wasted here, which is disappointing, A ""Breakdown"" type suspense story would have been better, who knows it might have gotten a theatrical release, you can't fault Wuhrer or Busey, but Howell should have known better!!",2,Could have been a good follow-up!!!!,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,2764,"['What', 'wrong', 'filmakers', 'here', 'first', 'film', 'was',

754138,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00009LIA5,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[7, 9]","Upon first look at the Hitcher 2, your first question will simply be, why?  Why was this direct to video sequel to an 80's horror/suspense classic even green lighted?  Who knows, but it shouldn't have been.  Despite some relatively good stretches, for the most part the Hitcher 2, which retreads on the plot of the original, is a routine and predictable pot boiler.  An older C. Thomas Howell returns as Jim, who is now a troubled cop trying to put his past behind him and go away for a little R&R with his girlfriend (Kari Wuhrer).  Eventually, they come across a hitcher (Jake Busey) whom they pick up, and well, you know where this is going.  Busey is good as a murdering psychopath who may or may not be Rutger Hauer's character from the original film, but Howell looks so bored in his brief return as Jim, and Wuhrer's acting abilities are wasted leaving her as eye candy (which isn't such a bad thing).  The police force is presented here as ignorant hillbillies, a stereotype which the original Hitcher avoided, and the acting isn't anything to write home about either.

I was really looking forward to seeing this, and I was one of the first in line to get it. When I saw it I wasn't displeased, but it wasn't as great as the first. The bad things about this is the music also isn't as great, the plot confuses me at points, the hitcher on this one isn't nearly as good as Rutger hauer from the first movie, the way the hitcher dies on this one is a bit stupid and the main character from the first gets killed on this one and the woman has to kill the hitcher by hirself. The camera work looks a bit bad in this film also. But still, the action still has its place in this sequel. Too be honest, this film is not nearly as dark or as atmospheric as the original. There are no huge stunts, massive action sequences or anything. I do recommend the shootout scene in the restaurant though. But, really, you have to see the first film, since that is an all time classic. Get that instead.",3,It's okay.

And it is exactly because Hauer is not in this one that I cant give it more than 3 stars.  It tries too hard to be as good as the original and Jake Bussey has been given an impossible job of trying to be as menacing a character as the memorable John Ryder played by Hauer.  And as for C. Thomas Howell?  [Darn], I thought his character would be in a mental ward for the rest of his life after what he went through.  Still, its worth a look.  Maybe rent before buying.

Although not quite as good as the first Hitcher, I found this movie thrilling and suspenseful for not being a horror movie. C. Thomas Howell returns in this sequel as Jim Halsey who survived the crazed Hitcher of the first movie. His girlfriend in the movie, Maggie ( played by the very pretty Kari Wuhrer ) is a tough cookie and delivers a great performance for she is a survivor!! Jim decides to take Maggie back to Texas where his original nightmare began years ago. They come across a hitchhiker who Maggie wants to pick up. After being a victim of the first hitchhiker, Jim does not want to pick up any more hitchhikers but gets talked into it by his girlfriend. The new crazed hitcher is named Jack ( played by Jake Busey ). Busey also delivers a good performance as a crazed man. Their journey turns into a nightmare when they realize they have picked up a psychopath. From then on, the film has many twists and surprises. I found it was entertaining from beginning to end. There is strong violence in this movie but it's not your basic gore movie. I really liked this movie and don't regret buying it. If you like thrillers, this is a movie for you. I don't quite understand the bad reviews about this movie. I'd suggest renting it and decide for yourself. I think most people will like it.",3,Pretty Good Thriller.....,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,1385,"['fan', 'Hitcher', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'Hitcher', 'II', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'Hitcher', 'found', 'movie', 'thrilling', 'suspenseful', 'not', 'being', 'horror', 'movie', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'sequel', 'Jim', 'Halsey', 'who', 'survived', 'crazed', 'Hitcher', 'first', 'movie', 'girlfriend', 'movie', 'Maggie', 'played', 'very', 'pretty', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'tough', 'cookie', 'great', 'performance', 'survivor', 'Jim', 'take', 'Maggie', 'back', 'Texas', 'where', 'original', 'nightmare', 'began', 'years', 'ago', 'come', 'hitchhiker', 'who', 'Maggie', 'pick', 'up', 'being', 'victim', 'first', 'hitchhiker', 'Jim', 'not', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'hitchhikers', 'talked', 'girlfriend', 'new', 'crazed', 'hitcher', 'named', 'Jack', 'played', 'Jake', 'Busey', 'Busey', 'also', 'good', 'performance', 'crazed', 'man', 'journey', 'nightmare', 'when', 'realize', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'psychopath', 'then', 'film', 'many', 'twists', 'surprises', 'found', 'was', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'end', 'strong', 'violence', 'movie', 'not', 'basic', 'gore', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'buying', 'like', 'thrillers', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'bad', 'reviews', 'movie', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'renting', 'decide', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'like']",The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting

Taken on it's own merits, without theexpectations of living up to the original, this isn't really toobad of a film. I mean, with most of the horror movies that havecome out recently {Freddy VS Jason, House Of The Dead},amongothers, this one ranks quite favorably. Jake Busey may not liveup to Rutger Hauer{wouldn't it have been nice if he came backfor the sequel instead of Howell?} but he certainly out didRobert Englund's latest effort. This does not live up to theoriginal Hitcher, but neither do any of the other shockerscoming out these days. I've seen the new Busey in a few bad guyroles now. I kind of like his style. If you can't get past thecomparison with the first Hitcher,then there isn't much sensein wasting your time with it.
