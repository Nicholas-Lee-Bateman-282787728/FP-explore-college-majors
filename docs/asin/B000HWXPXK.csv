And, believe it or not, that is NOT the low point of the film!The basic plot of the film: A group of gay friends are graduating from high school, and form a pact to make sure they lose their ""anal virginity"" before the summer is over and they go off to college. The main character is Andy, who has a crush on a Russian teacher (played to the hilt by Graham Norton) and whose father (played by gay comic Scott Thompson) tries to keep him from stealing all of the carrots and cucumbers in the house, by buying him a HUGE buttplug. Jarod is a varsity athlete, Griff the shy closet romantic who strives for a ""bubble butt"", and Nico is a queeny punkish partyboy, with a blind girlfriend and a mom who seems clueless to her son's sexuality. They get advice from their bulldyke best friend Muffler, who seems to be able to seduce any woman, straight or gay. Their dates include guest stars Matthew Rush (a gay porn star), Richard Hatch (""Survivor"") and James Getzlaff (""Boy Meets Boy"").To be honest, ANOTHER GAY MOVIE is often hillarious in its outrageousness, and the (I'd bet 100% gay) small crowd at the theatre during the showing I attended laughed a lot and seemed to enjoy it, though I doubt any of them would have rated it higher than I did. In my opinion, the humor would register more with older gays (30+) who can identify (Been there, done that) with the cluelessness of the young main characters, as opposed to informed teens and 20-somethings who grew up in more open times and had resources like the internet. Also, I'd bet that there was at least one or two scenes most viewers would have preferred weren't there, be it the overdone bathroom humor, a naked Richard Hatch waiting waiting for Nico to have sex with him, or the two guys at the bar with NAMBLA (a group that advocates sex with young boys) t-shirts advising Griff that he is ""way too old"" at 17.Beyond the sight gags and gross-outs, the story is predictable, with a lot of overacting, scenes meant to shock rather than add anything to the film, and lots of unrealistic scenarios. But I did love the theme song, ""Another Gay Sunshine Day"" sung by Nancy Sinatra. :)The theatrical film is not rated, but would be courting an NC-17 due to abundant frontal nudity, simulated sex, grahic sex talk and over-the-top S&M; content (Trust me: you'll never look at Graham Norton quite the same way again!) Not likely to go into wide release but, FYI, the DVD release date was just announced to be November 21st.",3,"Hillarious, but very ""over the top"" in gross scenes",1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,2648,"['Reviewers', 'have', 'called', 'gay', ""'American"", 'Pie', 'more', 'proper', 'name', 'might', 'be', 'Gay', 'Anerican', 'Quiche', 'dish', 'used', 'same', 'way', 'apple', 'pie', 'teen', 'flick', 'believe', 'not', 'NOT', 'low', 'point', 'film', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'group', 'gay', 'friends', 'are', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'form', 'pact', 'make', 'sure', 'lose', 'anal', 'virginity', 'summer', 'go', 'off', 'college', 'main', 'character', 'Andy', 'who', 'crush', 'Russian', 'teacher', 'played', 'hilt', 'Graham', 'Norton', 'father', 'played', 'gay', 'comic', 'Scott', 'Thompson', 'keep', 'stealing', 'carrots', 'cucumbers', 'house', 'buying', 'HUGE', 'buttplug', 'Jarod', 'varsity', 'athlete', 'Griff', 'shy', 'closet', 'romantic', 'who', 'bubble', 'butt', 'Nico', 'queeny', 'punkish', 'partyboy', 'blind', 'girlfriend', 'mom', 'who', 'clueless', 'son', 'sexuality', 'get', 'advice', 'bulldyke', 'best', 'friend', 'Muffler', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'seduce', 'woman', 'straight', 'gay', 'dates', 'include', 'guest', 'stars', 'Matthew', 'Rush', 'gay', 'porn', 'star', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'Survivor', 'James', 'Getzlaff', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'Boy', '.To', 'be', 'honest', 'ANOTHER', 'GAY', 'MOVIE', 'often', 'hillarious', 'outrageousness', ""'d"", 'bet', '100', '%', 'gay', 'small', 'crowd', 'theatre', 'showing', 'attended', 'laughed', 'lot', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'higher', 'did', 'opinion', 'humor', 'would', 'register', 'more', 'older', 'gays', '30+', 'who', 'can', 'identify', 'Been', 'there', 'done', 'cluelessness', 'young', 'main', 'characters', 'opposed', 'informed', 'teens', '20-somethings', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'more', 'open', 'times', 'had', 'resources', 'internet', 'Also', ""'d"", 'bet', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'be', 'overdone', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'naked', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'waiting', 'waiting', 'Nico', 'have', 'sex', 'two', 'guys', 'bar', 'NAMBLA', 'group', 'sex', 'young', 'boys', 't-shirts', 'advising', 'Griff', 'way', 'too', 'old', '17.Beyond', 'sight', 'gags', 'gross-outs', 'story', 'predictable', 'lot', 'overacting', 'scenes', 'meant', 'shock', 'rather', 'add', 'anything', 'film', 'lots', 'unrealistic', 'scenarios', 'did', 'love', 'theme', 'song', 'Gay', 'Sunshine', 'Day', 'sung', 'Nancy', 'Sinatra', 'theatrical', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'courting', 'NC-17', 'due', 'abundant', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'simulated', 'sex', 'grahic', 'sex', 'talk', 'over-the-top', 'S', 'M', 'content', 'Trust', ""'ll"", 'never', 'look', 'Graham', 'Norton', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'Not', 'likely', 'go', 'wide', 'release', 'FYI', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'just', 'announced', 'be', 'November', '21st']",N/A

Never buy a DVD by it's cover.  I always wait for the customer reviews on Amazon to find out if it's good or not.  Make sure there are lots of reviews (minimum 30) with no less than 3.5 stars on average.  So I felt I had to let customers know that this movie is good, so it can start building a good review history.""Another Gay Movie"" is just plain funny... and silly.  It really is a gay ""American Pie"" type movie, which was crude too, but was very popular with the audiences none the less, (as I'm sure this one will be too).The acting was good... no one was lacking in talent.  All the characters were likeable (well maybe not Richard Hatch)!  This movie covers every gay fable, myth or rumour of just about everything in the gay wikpedia of life (gerbaling, water sports, BDSM, vanilla to Belgian chocolate, Paul Lynde, Betty Davis, bubble butts, Mommy Dearest, toilet trading, over douching, pumps).  You name it and the movie made fun of it.The cinematography was good, considering this movie is low budget.  The characters lived in over colour/color saturated Brady Bunch Bungalow houses (a la ""Edward Scissorhands"").  It's hard to believe the movie was shot in 16 days.  These are some very hard working people who made this film!If you enjoy comedy... and you want to spend an evening having a good laugh, then buy this movie.  You won't regret it.

An embarrassment for everybody involved. Graham Norton should be forced to do community service, and Richard Hatch should go to jail for showing us everything. Oh wait, he is in jail.

It is a colorful, fast-paced, wonderfully silly, knock 'em dead parody of gay stereotypes boasting a fine cast of actors who know how to pull this caper off and seem to have a terrific time doing it!Four gay high school friends make a pact at graduation that they will loose their virginity before Labor Day.  Egged  on by the gross lesbian Muffler (Ashlie Atkinson) the four plan their ploys in a funny session and the fun begins.  Andy (Michael Carbonaro), in constant fantasy about his teacher Mr. Puckov (Graham Norton) 'prepares' himself with various instruments only to be discovered in embarrassing situations by his wild mother (John Epperson aka Lypsinka) and his bisexual father (Scott Thompson).  Nico (Jonah Blechman) is so over-the-top outrageous that he believes no one knows he is gay - not his warmly wise mother (Stephanie McVay) or his hilarious blind 'girlfriend' Daisy (Joanna Leeds). Star-struck he goes after celebrities such as Richard Hatch (playing himself) to little avail.  Jarod (Jonathan Chase) seems to have little trouble attracting studs like Beau (studly James Getzlaff) and Griff (Mitch Morris) is stricken with the hunky stripper Angel (the ever so buff Darryl Stephens).  Each young man finds the trail to loss of virginity a trial but it all comes together 'in the end'.Films like this are tough to pull off: audiences think they will be offended by the fairly frank and inside jokes.

Mommie Dearest as a character is surprisingly subtle--but (have no fear!) that doesn't prevent the wire hanger moment at the film's beginning from being scary in its own way.The film goes happily along, combining nudity, humor, and wonderfully varied characters. The four central characters are, of course, stereotypes in a film that sends up stereotypes, but here, in this raunchy comedy, they're so well written and so well played that they suggest greater depth than they do in Very Serious films.Those looking for strong moral values in the film will want to see the glass table sequence, practically a public service announcement for ing&eacute;nues everywhere.

Poking fun at gay stereotypes is one thing; but in order to make it work and not insult the intelligence of even the average movie-goer, there has to BE some intelligence at the core of the movie and all its elements: story, script, acting, etc. AGM falls tragically short in all respects, unless you find the ""humor"" of movies like Big Mama's Place, Little Man, and the Scary Movies to be side-splitting and hilarious.What was even more sad was seeing Nancy Sinatra associated with this turkey. This is a talented singer who had some absolutely GREAT songs in the mid and late 60's, all of which I loved. Must have been a pretty big check they dangled in front of her.This ended up being one of those times when I thought, ""Well, there's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back."" As a member of the gay community, I felt embarrassed by the absence of quality here--as if the entire project were conceived by oversexed junior high school boys. There have been much, much better gay comedies...TORCH SONG TRILOGY...KISS ME, GUIDO...LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION!...even the intentional silliness of JEFFREY at least had some brains behind it.

1016633,A224BKBLXVA859,B000HWXPXK,Rocky Sunico,"[0, 0]","As a satirical comedy, I can understand the need for the movie to borrow concepts from popular comedies (gay or otherwise). That's how satires are supposed to work. However there's a rather fine line between good satire and a cheap knock-off, and this is where this movie struggles. Instead of being a somewhat witty attempt to poke fun at various LGBT comedy movies and their stereotypes, it instead embraces everything it hopes to satire and becomes a full part of the ridiculous demographic.The core plot is a raunchier clone of the plot of American Pie, down to Andy's need to vent his sexual frustrations on food products and repeatedly getting caught by his parents. From the opening scene with practically everyone needing to walk in on Andy, it sort of sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Thus it's the same low-brow humor that has become rather popular in recent years but hyper-sexualized - I guess for the equally stereotypical notion that the LGBT community's sense of humor is grounded in sex-related jokes. Thus this is as much a satire as the Scary Movie franchise and it's related genre-specific spin-offs.The movie just keeps hurling cheap joke after cheap joke in an effort to hopefully catch something that might make the audience laugh. Beyond the sexual jokes, they decide to take further advantage of other sources of low-brow humor including racial stereotypes and Richard Hatch. And man, that was a really bad scene indeed. CANNOT UNSEE.I really think the movie could have done a lot more with its premise. There are better, wittier, snarkier ways of making fun of the tropes of other movies. Simply repeating them in a weird hodgepodge mash-up while turning the crass sexual humor dial on HIGH isn't the way to do it. And thus the ridiculousness of the movie never really drew me in.Another Gay Movie certainly lives up to its title - it is really just another cheap gay comedy that contributes nothing new to the genre.

I mean, this is a totally over-the-top, overacted, gross-out and incorrect movie that makes ""American Pie"" look like Henry VIII. If you have ever seen any straight movie where the over-hormomic teens make a goal about betting laid before the end of summer, just substitute gay kids for the straight ones and you have the basics of AGM.What really will irk the PC crowd (and even made me squirm a bit) was that no topic was off limits. I flinched at the following; Gerbil Joke, Nambla joke and Belgian Chocolate joke. As someone who went through the late 80's having to shout down idiots who kept that Gerbil Joke alive (and it cost a Philadelphia Newsman his job because a variant of the story got pinned on him), I fail to see the humor. On the other hand, the amount of corn this movie lays on makes it almost impossible not to start snickering, even when the humor is lowest common denominator juvenilia. Yes, gay movies can now make the same stupid fart jokes that show up in bad Eddie Murphy flicks. Like I said, maybe that's progress.Then again, maybe it ain't so bad after all.
