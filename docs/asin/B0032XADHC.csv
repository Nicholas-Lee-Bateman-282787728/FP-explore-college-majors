Paresh was funny and loud. Kat had no scope, same with Sameer. Neha acted well.

1319480,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B0032XADHC,Amit Talpade,"[0, 1]","De Dana Dan is an unpretentious movie of the slap stick variety and desperately wants to entertain its audience but despite having Sunil Shetty, Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal, the trio who were so funny in Hera Pheri fails. De Dana Dan is about a kidnapping of a dog. Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty decide to kidnap a dog which belongs to Akshay's boss and demand a ransom. The ransom is to be delivered at a hotel where a host of other characters have embarked for a wedding. As it would, identities are confused and chaos ensues. This identity chaos was hilarious in Hungaama and Hera Pheri but just does not work in this film. There are too many characters and they don't have any chemistry because the writing is poor. I love pedestrian and corny comedies but hated this one.

1319483,A9T0DBHRUV2N7,B0032XADHC,Lee Jilek,"[1, 2]","De Dana Dan (3D) is one of those movies that brings a reduction in IQ with each subsequent watching.  The first watching I laughed a little mostly just trying to read the subtitles and keep up.  The second watching I laughed a lot and by the third watching I thought it was hilarious.3D is a masterpiece of confusion. 3D makes absolutely no attempt to confuse the audience; rather many of the main characters are wildly and hopelessly confused. The film makes no attempt to unconfuse them, either.  Even to the very end the actors become furious in their unacceptable positions. To make matters better, Johnny Lever (who I think has ruined scenes in many movies), is also confused and seriously abused. He is actually pretty good, but all of the actors are very good at selling the crazy script.  Except for a few places the slapstick is pretty high quality, really.The songs and dancing are catchy, lively and have integrity in that they stick to a theme.  Hotty Naughty, performed in a casino, features Neha Dhupia with some male backup dancers living up to its title. It's hot and it's naughty. A real foot tapper.Baamulaiza features Katrina, Akshay, Sunial Shetty and Sameera Reddy. Kat is wearing a dress that flows like magic and Sameera is captivating with Shreya Goshal singing playback. Does Akshay ever behave?  The song Paisa Paisa is pretty good too. None of the music disappoints.There is a huge well done water scene at the end of the movie. Although some of the water is real, most of the water is fake high tech digital water.There is a reason why 3D is currently the 5th highest grossing Indian film in 2009. I give the movie 4 1/2 based on the value received relative to the amount paid.",5,Maybe too much fun for one movie.,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,1705,"['De', 'Dana', 'Dan', '3D', 'one', 'movies', 'reduction', 'IQ', 'subsequent', 'watching', 'first', 'watching', 'laughed', 'little', 'mostly', 'just', 'trying', 'read', 'subtitles', 'keep', 'up', 'second', 'watching', 'laughed', 'lot', 'third', 'watching', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious.3D', 'masterpiece', 'confusion', '3D', 'absolutely', 'attempt', 'confuse', 'audience', 'rather', 'many', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'wildly', 'hopelessly', 'confused', 'film', 'attempt', 'unconfuse', 'either', 'Even', 'very', 'end', 'actors', 'become', 'furious', 'unacceptable', 'positions', 'make', 'matters', 'better', 'Johnny', 'Lever', 'who', 'think', 'ruined', 'scenes', 'many', 'movies', 'also', 'confused', 'seriously', 'abused', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'selling', 'crazy', 'script', 'few', 'places', 'slapstick', 'pretty', 'high', 'quality', 'really.The', 'songs', 'dancing', 'are', 'catchy', 'lively', 'have', 'integrity', 'stick', 'theme', 'Hotty', 'Naughty', 'performed', 'casino', 'Neha', 'Dhupia', 'male', 'backup', 'dancers', 'living', 'up', 'title', 'hot', 'naughty', 'real', 'foot', 'tapper.Baamulaiza', 'features', 'Katrina', 'Akshay', 'Sunial', 'Shetty', 'Sameera', 'Reddy', 'Kat', 'wearing', 'dress', 'magic', 'Sameera', 'captivating', 'Shreya', 'Goshal', 'singing', 'playback', 'Does', 'Akshay', 'ever', 'behave', 'song', 'Paisa', 'Paisa', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'None', 'music', 'huge', 'well', 'done', 'water', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'water', 'real', 'most', 'water', 'fake', 'high', 'tech', 'digital', 'water.There', 'reason', 'why', '3D', 'currently', '5th', 'highest', 'grossing', 'Indian', 'film', '2009', 'give', 'movie', '4', '1/2', 'based', 'value', 'received', 'relative', 'amount', 'paid']",N/A

Please skip this movie if you hate to see water wasted, shamelessly wasted by a group of actors who will do anything for money. This is one mess of a film; it's a mixture of bad dialogue, misplaced loyalties, confusion between families, mistaken identities, and the worst usage of water I have ever seen. It is made equally shameless when these very same actors stand in front of audiences and talk about Global Warming and other issues pertinent to India, especially the issue of water. What a bunch of pathetic hypocrites! It pains me to see the talents of actors like Rajpal Yadev and Paresh Rawel wasted in this horrendous display of acting. Now, I will admit there are moments in the film that are funny. But it goes without saying that 99% of the actors in this film can't act and are not worth watching.
