728921,A2JJSCIGPZDWHI,B00007GZRS,BENJAMIN MILER,"[5, 7]","Since 1976, when I was a small kid until now, I've lived in Eugene, Oregon on and off. For some reason back in the early '80s I was not made aware of How to Beat the High Cost of Living. I think a lot of reasons for that was another movie filmed in Eugene back in 1978 was much more successful and received much more attention, I'm referring to National Lampoon's Animal House. And I would have imagined seeing this film on television back in the 1980s, but I never did.This is a great little time capsule from 1980 (actually 1979, it was filmed in 1979, not released until mid 1980), showing places like the Valley River Center (the mall the movie was set) and other places were like before they were remodeled beyond recognition. Seeing the interior of Valley River Center really took me back since me and my family would go there from time to time back then (back in 1980, me and my family lived within walking distance from Valley River Center, thanks to a bicycle footbridge crossing the Willamette River to VRC). The movie proudly shows the Meier & Frank (complete with that late '60s logo and rotunda - you have to bear in mind Valley River Center opened up in 1969, and so did its Meier & Frank), as well as all the other (real) shops that existed in Valley River Center at the time. I was a bit bewildered why they didn't show the Montgomery Ward's, which was opposite from Fredrick & Nelson. Outside of Valley River Center, there's a scene at an Albertson's, a store I've been in personally, at that time, and still go to now (although, like most everything else, remodeled and expanded beyond recognition since), and Taco Time, a taco joint (not unlike Taco Bell) that was established here in Eugene. There's even a scene at Skinner's Butte at night. I can go on about the changes since (how the mall and those establishments went through many remodels), but I have to say that How to Beat the High Cost of Living is just about the only Hollywood movie that I have personally visited many of those locations that were filmed, and had so even just very recently, even if they're now practically unrecognizable from the film. Not to mention that by 2006 the Meier & Frank was no more, replaced by an already existing Macy's (since the May Co. which owned Meier & Frank since 1966, was bought out by Federated Department Stores, and they decided to change all the stores they bought out into Macy's). At least I was happy that the Valley River Center's Meier & Frank kept the old logo and old look right until its early 2006 demise.Most of the film is quite accurate of Eugene, although there's one scene where Jane Curtin gets pulled over by Dabney Coleman for running a stop sign, it occurred at Main St. Now, unless she happened to wander off to neighboring Springfield, there is no Main St. in Eugene (Main Street in Springfield heads from downtown eastward out of town off Hwy. 126).The movie consists of three ladies, Jane Curtin, Susan St. James, and Jessica Lange who, due to divorce and poor business decisions, leaves them bankrupt and desperate. So you have to watch this film to see what happens next. Just that I tell you involves a money ball in the middle of Valley River Center.I don't claim it to be the greatest movie out there, and I can do without some of the acting, but I still like it. Plus it's set in a town I live in, where I have personally been to many of the locations the film were shot at (though I never personally witnessed the film being shot). I am so happy they didn't use Eugene as a backdrop, and then use Hollywood locations with totally fictitious landmarks and businesses, this is the real Eugene in and out, at least as it was in 1980.If you're a Eugene native, and have lived here as long as I have, you owe it to yourself to check out this film. If you're new to Eugene, then seen this film, you're looking at Eugene as it was at the end of the '70s/turn of the '80s.",4,"Review from a Eugene, Oregon native",1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,3919,"['1976', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'kid', 'now', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Eugene', 'Oregon', 'off', 'reason', 'back', 'early', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'aware', 'How', 'Beat', 'High', 'Cost', 'Living', 'think', 'lot', 'reasons', 'was', 'movie', 'filmed', 'Eugene', 'back', '1978', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'received', 'much', 'more', 'attention', ""'m"", 'referring', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Animal', 'House', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'seeing', 'film', 'television', 'back', '1980s', 'never', 'did.This', 'great', 'little', 'time', 'capsule', '1980', 'actually', '1979', 'was', 'filmed', '1979', 'not', 'released', 'mid', '1980', 'showing', 'places', 'Valley', 'River', 'Center', 'mall', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'other', 'places', 'were', 'were', 'remodeled', 'recognition', 'Seeing', 'interior', 'Valley', 'River', 'Center', 'really', 'took', 'back', 'family', 'would', 'go', 'there', 'time', 'time', 'back', 'then', 'back', '1980', 'family', 'lived', 'walking', 'distance', 'Valley', 'River', 'Center', 'thanks', 'bicycle', 'footbridge', 'crossing', 'Willamette', 'River', 'VRC', 'movie', 'proudly', 'Meier', 'Frank', 'complete', 'late', ""'60s"", 'logo', 'rotunda', 'have', 'bear', 'mind', 'Valley', 'River', 'Center', 'opened', 'up', '1969', 'so', 'did', 'Meier', 'Frank', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'real', 'existed', 'Valley', 'River', 'Center', 'time', 'was', 'bit', 'bewildered', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'Montgomery', 'Ward', 'was', 'opposite', 'Fredrick', 'Nelson', 'Outside', 'Valley', 'River', 'Center', 'scene', 'Albertson', 'store', ""'ve"", 'been', 'personally', 'time', 'still', 'go', 'now', 'most', 'everything', 'else', 'remodeled', 'expanded', 'recognition', 'Taco', 'Time', 'taco', 'joint', 'not', 'Taco', 'Bell', 'was', 'established', 'here', 'Eugene', 'even', 'scene', 'Skinner', 'Butte', 'night', 'can', 'go', 'changes', 'how', 'mall', 'establishments', 'went', 'many', 'remodels', 'have', 'say', 'How', 'Beat', 'High', 'Cost', 'Living', 'just', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'have', 'personally', 'visited', 'many', 'locations', 'were', 'filmed', 'had', 'so', 'even', 'just', 'very', 'recently', 'even', ""'re"", 'now', 'practically', 'unrecognizable', 'film', 'Not', 'mention', '2006', 'Meier', 'Frank', 'was', 'more', 'replaced', 'already', 'existing', 'Macy', 'May', 'Co.', 'owned', 'Meier', 'Frank', '1966', 'was', 'bought', 'out', 'Federated', 'Department', 'Stores', 'decided', 'change', 'stores', 'bought', 'out', 'Macy', 'least', 'was', 'happy', 'Valley', 'River', 'Center', 'Meier', 'Frank', 'kept', 'old', 'logo', 'old', 'look', 'right', 'early', '2006', 'demise.Most', 'film', 'quite', 'accurate', 'Eugene', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'pulled', 'over', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'running', 'stop', 'sign', 'occurred', 'Main', 'St.', 'Now', 'happened', 'wander', 'off', 'neighboring', 'Springfield', 'Main', 'St.', 'Eugene', 'Main', 'Street', 'Springfield', 'heads', 'downtown', 'eastward', 'town', 'Hwy', '126', '.The', 'movie', 'three', 'ladies', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'Susan', 'St.', 'James', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'who', 'due', 'divorce', 'poor', 'business', 'decisions', 'bankrupt', 'desperate', 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'Just', 'tell', 'money', 'ball', 'middle', 'Valley', 'River', 'Center.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'greatest', 'movie', 'there', 'can', 'do', 'acting', 'still', 'set', 'town', 'live', 'where', 'have', 'personally', 'been', 'many', 'locations', 'film', 'were', 'shot', 'never', 'personally', 'witnessed', 'film', 'being', 'shot', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'Eugene', 'backdrop', 'then', 'use', 'Hollywood', 'locations', 'totally', 'fictitious', 'landmarks', 'businesses', 'real', 'Eugene', 'least', 'was', '1980.If', ""'re"", 'Eugene', 'native', 'have', 'lived', 'here', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'owe', 'yourself', 'check', 'out', 'film', ""'re"", 'new', 'Eugene', 'then', 'seen', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Eugene', 'was', 'end', ""'70s/turn"", ""'80s""]",How to Beat the High Cost of Living

Jane and Robert waking up in the back of Jane's station wagon. The reason there sleeping in the station wagon is the Jane's kids think that Robert is there Uncle and how do you explaining sleeping with the kids uncle. Jane states to Robert that she wants to talk to him about getting married. Robert replies that he can't get married until old man Willard dies and he gets the store. Meanwhile Louise shows up at here husbands veterinarian office looking for her husband. Louise and Albert have been married for nine years and she needs Albert to write her a check for one thousand dollars for the merchandise that she bought for here antique store. Meanwhile Jane has arrived at her home with bags of clothes that she bought and takes them upstairs to the bedroom. While she starts to undress, she turns on the answering machine where she hears a message from her husband. On the machine is her husband trying to explain to her that he's leaving her. Elaine goes to the closet to find his things gone so she smashes the machine and throws her wedding ring outside. Elaine goes to the bank and finds out that her husband beat her there, by cleaning out there account selling all her jewelry and leaving Elaine with just $480.00 dollars in her Christmas fund. The next day Albert is in his office with the IRS and after going over his books, Albert is told that the IRS owes him $11.19. However, the IRS wants to know about the 36,000 dollars that he gave Louise for her antique store. Albert states the antique store is a business but the IRS states that it's a hobby so now unless Albert can prove it's a business he will owe the IRS taxes on the $36,000 plus penalties. Meanwhile Jane's ex comes to pickup the kids and she hits him up for more child support in which her ex replies that he can't. Meanwhile after having a few drinks at the local tavern Elaine gets into car to leave. She pulls out crossing lanes and then goes right through a stop sign. Sitting at that stop sign is a police officer who turns his lights on and goes after her and finally pulling her over. Elaine is talking to the officer and finds out that he's married. So Elaine starts hitting the officer with her purse and the officers tells her that if she hits him once more he'll arrest her. She states that if he does the first phone call she makes will bee to his wife. Now some thoughts of my own on this movie. I love this movie because it caught my attention through the entire picture. I give Jane Curtin 6 stars because she wasn't bad in her movie debut. I thought that Jessica Lange was even better in her role as the doctor's wife. However, I bought this movie for two reasons. The first was Susan Saint James who looked great in jeans and everything else she wore. The second reason, Sybil Danning who was Albert receptionist and was excellent at it.

Its great for seeing the sometimes ugly styles of the time, especially the shopping mall.

The chemistry between the three leads is terrific, and it's interesting to see Jessica Lange right before she hit it big with Tootsie and Frances. The plot's implausible, sure, but it makes for great comedy--and as another reviewer stated, it certainly resonates with the state of today's economy. Lots of great one-liners and for such an implausible plot, due to the skill of the actors it really doesn't seem as outlandish.
