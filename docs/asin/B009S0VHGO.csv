1601721,A2144JW4V8GNX2,B009S0VHGO,"Brett Scheuermann ""Brett""","[3, 5]","There seems to be an invisible war going on between the worlds of ""festival"" movies and ""Hollywood"" movies. Festival snobs will accuse the movies produced by the Hollywood machine of being drool-inducing and mindless, while popcorn-crunchers will attack independent productions as pretentious and artsy-for-its-own-sake.In reality, both categories have their strengths and weaknesses. Hollywood movies take advantage of the massive budgets and A-list talent made available to them, and the (admittedly rare) truly talented creative men and women know how to make immensely satisfying spectacles. Festival movies, made with small budgets and seemingly often willed into existence by the sheer determination of the filmmakers, are usually full of heart and are allowed to experiment a bit more than a Hollywood production due to not being tied down to a money-minded producer's will.It is only rarely that a movie will satisfy on both sides. A Dangerous Place draws from the thriller tradition of big Hollywood but never loses its ability to involve the audience's emotions and challenge norms. It is a movie about the strength of an independent woman forced to act with the safety of the country on the line that keeps the audience both riveted and intellectually and emotionally involved. Having seen the movie at the 2012 Garden State Film Festival, where it won the best picture award and set attendance records, I was witness to the way the entire audience reacted to both the emotional moments and the thrilling ones. A film with the ability to do both holds a special power and indicates a special talent.A sight that I won't forget: old ladies in the audience cheering passionately as the antagonist meets his violent demise. This is how you know a movie has succeeded in involving its audience.A great movie that is relevant to the times, emotionally involving, and as thrilling as anything Hollywood is capable of producing.",5,An uncommon hybrid,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,1932,"['be', 'invisible', 'war', 'going', 'worlds', 'festival', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Festival', 'snobs', 'will', 'accuse', 'movies', 'produced', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'being', 'drool-inducing', 'mindless', 'popcorn-crunchers', 'will', 'attack', 'independent', 'productions', 'pretentious', 'artsy-for-its-own-sake.In', 'reality', 'categories', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'take', 'advantage', 'massive', 'budgets', 'A-list', 'talent', 'made', 'available', 'admittedly', 'rare', 'truly', 'talented', 'creative', 'men', 'women', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'spectacles', 'Festival', 'movies', 'made', 'small', 'budgets', 'seemingly', 'often', 'willed', 'existence', 'sheer', 'determination', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'usually', 'full', 'heart', 'are', 'allowed', 'experiment', 'bit', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'due', 'not', 'being', 'tied', 'money-minded', 'producer', 'will.It', 'only', 'rarely', 'movie', 'will', 'satisfy', 'sides', 'Dangerous', 'Place', 'draws', 'thriller', 'tradition', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'ability', 'involve', 'audience', 'emotions', 'challenge', 'norms', 'movie', 'strength', 'independent', 'woman', 'forced', 'act', 'safety', 'country', 'line', 'audience', 'riveted', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'Having', 'seen', 'movie', '2012', 'Garden', 'State', 'Film', 'Festival', 'where', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'award', 'set', 'attendance', 'records', 'was', 'witness', 'way', 'entire', 'audience', 'reacted', 'both', 'emotional', 'moments', 'thrilling', 'ones', 'film', 'ability', 'do', 'special', 'power', 'special', 'talent.A', 'sight', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'old', 'ladies', 'audience', 'cheering', 'passionately', 'antagonist', 'violent', 'demise', 'how', 'know', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'involving', 'audience.A', 'great', 'movie', 'relevant', 'times', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'as', 'thrilling', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'capable', 'producing']",A Dangerous Place
1601722,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B009S0VHGO,Joe Smart,"[1, 1]","Warning--possible spoilers:  I seriously can't believe all of the rave reviews for this movie.  This is a dopey low budget paranoia thriller about a pharmaceutical executive who finds that her company is behind an anthrax outbreak that they happen to have a cure for so the companies stock price will be raised and the company can be sold for an enormous profit, making everyone who works at the company millionaires in the process.  At one point the authorities even trace the outbreak back to the company, come to the mistaken conclusion that it was the work of a single person who had been framed by the real culprit (the suspect conveniently died of the disease) and then nothing happens.  Literally.  There is no further criminal investigation.  There are no congressional hearings.  There is no negative effect on the company's stock price.  There is no attempt by anyone to stop the company from benefiting from the release of the disease by selling to another company.  There are no threats of lawsuits by families of the victims.  There are no protests outside the offices of the company.  It seems like literally nobody in the United States cares about this other than the lead character.  It's hard to enjoy a movie when it has so little grasp of reality that it seems to actually be taking place in some sort of alternate universe.  There is also a subplot involving the ghost of the lead character's husband, a firefighter who died on September 11th, hanging around her house long after his death.  He can move objects with his ghostly powers but does nothing when someone is in the house trying to kill his ex-wife.  He apparently thinks its more important to build an impossibly high block version of the twin towers for his wife and son during what is supposed to be a moving finale.  A Dangerous Place is undoubtedly sincere but it's clumsy and stupid and generally pretty damned awful.

The movie adds a cliche-ridden subplot about her husband killed in the 9/11 bombings and her son's inability to accept his dad's death.
