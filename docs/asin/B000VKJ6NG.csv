They were AWESOME!If you love classic rock, you'll really love JASON BONHAM on drums. He humbly carries the torch and his Dad (Led Zeppelin's legendary drummer John Bonham) is right in Jason's heart.Mick Jones never lost his touch - he jams with fantastic guitar & keyboard talent. This DVD will bring back memories and the band today will definitely make it easy to create new ones.OUTSTANDING ROCK - 10 STARS!",5,FOREIGNER REALLY ROCKS - Must Own DVD & Must See Live,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",2008,701,"['Alive', 'Rockin', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'FOREIGNER', 'DVD', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'band', 'musical', 'range', 'steller', 'performances', 'songs', 'are', 'always', 'are', 'true', 'rock', 'classics.I', 'was', 'very', 'lucky', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'live', 'meet', 'thier', 'New', 'Years', 'Eve', '2007', 'tour', 'were', 'AWESOME', 'love', 'classic', 'rock', ""'ll"", 'really', 'love', 'JASON', 'BONHAM', 'drums', 'humbly', 'torch', 'Dad', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'legendary', 'drummer', 'John', 'Bonham', 'right', 'Jason', 'heart.Mick', 'Jones', 'never', 'lost', 'touch', 'fantastic', 'guitar', 'keyboard', 'talent', 'DVD', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'memories', 'band', 'today', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'easy', 'create', 'new', 'ones.OUTSTANDING', 'ROCK', '10', 'STARS']",N/A

A nine song concert CD that was previously only released on DVD in 2007 of their 2006 Bang Your Head festival appearance, this album is a necessary addition to the library of any Foreigner fan.The line-up of the band at that time consisted of guitarist, Mick Jones, Kelly Hansen on vocals, drummer Jason Bonham, and Jeff Pilson on bass.  Listening to this CD brought back very pleasant memories of their show in September of last year when they opened for Journey.Clocking in at nearly one full hour, this album blasts right off the launch pad with the blistering hot performance of Double Vision that always has their fans on their feet and is delivered every bit as good as the studio version - if not better.From that point on, fans are taken through a memorable list of the bands more popular hits such as Head Games, Dirty White Boy, Cold As Ice, Starrider, Feels Like the First Time, Urgent, and Hot Blooded.  The Boomerocity favorite on this particular album (if a favorite had to be picked) is Juke Box Hero/Whole Lotta Love.  The song opens with a great solo by Bonham and ends with a nod to his dad by segueing into Whole Lotta Love to the cheers of appreciative fans.Pick up or download your copy of Alive & Rockin' for the great music, fun and memories.Boomerocity.com",5,Foriegner Still Alive and Rockin',1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,1353,"['Foreigner', 'fans', 'are', 'real', 'latest', 'CD', 'Alive', 'Rockin', 'nine', 'song', 'concert', 'CD', 'was', 'previously', 'only', 'released', 'DVD', '2007', '2006', 'Bang', 'Head', 'festival', 'appearance', 'album', 'necessary', 'addition', 'library', 'Foreigner', 'fan.The', 'line-up', 'band', 'time', 'consisted', 'guitarist', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'vocals', 'drummer', 'Jason', 'Bonham', 'Jeff', 'Pilson', 'bass', 'Listening', 'CD', 'brought', 'back', 'very', 'pleasant', 'memories', 'show', 'September', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'opened', 'Journey.Clocking', 'nearly', 'one', 'full', 'hour', 'album', 'right', 'launch', 'pad', 'blistering', 'hot', 'performance', 'Double', 'Vision', 'always', 'fans', 'feet', 'delivered', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'studio', 'version', 'not', 'better.From', 'point', 'fans', 'are', 'taken', 'memorable', 'list', 'bands', 'more', 'popular', 'hits', 'such', 'Head', 'Games', 'Dirty', 'White', 'Boy', 'Cold', 'Ice', 'Starrider', 'Feels', 'First', 'Time', 'Urgent', 'Hot', 'Blooded', 'Boomerocity', 'favorite', 'particular', 'album', 'favorite', 'had', 'be', 'picked', 'Juke', 'Box', 'Hero/Whole', 'Lotta', 'Love', 'song', 'great', 'solo', 'Bonham', 'nod', 'dad', 'segueing', 'Whole', 'Lotta', 'Love', 'cheers', 'appreciative', 'fans.Pick', 'up', 'download', 'copy', 'Alive', 'Rockin', 'great', 'music', 'fun', 'memories.Boomerocity.com']",N/A

Fact is Foreigner had some killer guitar riffs and great hooks yet were, all these years later, remembered for a couple of ballads that came to define the worst in radio overplay.  That Foreigner was done was pretty much a given since more than one reunion attempt between Mick Jones and Lou Gramm never really got much traction.  Only one thing...No one told Mick Jones this.  So now, a good 25 years past Foreigner's prime Mick is back with a new Foreigner in which he's the only original member.  This could be a pathetic attempt at a shameless money grab...Or, could it?Against all odds, the new Foreigner is really the best sounding Foreinger...ever!  This really is a shocker!  Mick Jones proves he is the real heart and soul of the band, that he can not just carry the torch, but build a better band around veteran journeymen who can replicate that original Foreigner sound and propel it further.  You may think bogus...No one can replace Lou Gramm.  Obviously you haven't seen this DVD with Kelly Hansen who not only can sound like Gramm, but looks like Steven Tyler and has both a range and stage presence that Gramm, at least of late, just couldn't match.  Foreigner is baaaack!Alive & Rockin' lives up to it's title and then some.  It's not the heavily produced live concert tightly controlled in both lighting and sound for DVD, but rather a document of a set turned in at a German heavy metal fest.  This actually seems to work in it's favor as it's ""all killer and no filler"".  While not reference in sight or sound it is quite good and it documents a performance in which a possibly hostile audience turns to putty as Foreigner proves there is new life in an old brand.  All in all, this is a great testament that Foreigner has a great catalog and is better than ever.  If you are at all interested do not hesitate.  Yes it's a bit raw, but it rocks hard and makes no excuses in doing so.  I would never have thought I'd be recommending anything by a band I thought was done, but, ""that was yesterday""!",4,Sounds Like The First Time,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,2155,"['Lots', 'folks', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'Foreigner', 'few', 'however', 'would', 'admit', 'be', 'card', 'carrying', 'fans', 'hoping', 'Foreigner', 'come', 'back', 'Fact', 'Foreigner', 'had', 'killer', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'great', 'hooks', 'yet', 'were', 'years', 'later', 'remembered', 'couple', 'ballads', 'came', 'define', 'worst', 'radio', 'overplay', 'Foreigner', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'more', 'one', 'reunion', 'attempt', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'much', 'traction', 'Only', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'told', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'So', 'now', 'good', '25', 'years', 'past', 'Foreigner', 'prime', 'Mick', 'back', 'new', 'Foreigner', 'only', 'original', 'member', 'could', 'be', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'shameless', 'money', 'grab', 'could', 'odds', 'new', 'Foreigner', 'really', 'best', 'sounding', 'Foreinger', 'ever', 'really', 'shocker', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'real', 'heart', 'soul', 'band', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'carry', 'torch', 'build', 'better', 'band', 'veteran', 'journeymen', 'who', 'can', 'replicate', 'original', 'Foreigner', 'sound', 'propel', 'further', 'may', 'think', 'bogus', 'one', 'can', 'replace', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'Obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'sound', 'Gramm', 'Steven', 'Tyler', 'range', 'stage', 'presence', 'Gramm', 'least', 'late', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'match', 'Foreigner', 'baaaack', 'Alive', 'Rockin', 'title', 'then', 'not', 'heavily', 'produced', 'live', 'concert', 'tightly', 'controlled', 'lighting', 'sound', 'DVD', 'rather', 'document', 'set', 'turned', 'German', 'heavy', 'metal', 'fest', 'actually', 'work', 'favor', 'killer', 'filler', 'not', 'reference', 'sight', 'sound', 'quite', 'good', 'documents', 'performance', 'possibly', 'hostile', 'audience', 'putty', 'Foreigner', 'new', 'life', 'old', 'brand', 'great', 'testament', 'Foreigner', 'great', 'catalog', 'better', 'ever', 'are', 'interested', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'Yes', 'bit', 'raw', 'hard', 'excuses', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'recommending', 'anything', 'band', 'thought', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'yesterday']",N/A
1102142,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B000VKJ6NG,moviemusicbuff,"[5, 7]","Foreigner has been let down by past music DVDs (particularly the awful All Access Concert w/ a terrible sounding Lou Gramm;  the Deer Park concert was good with Lou Gramm at his peak, but the camera work was very annoying).  No longer.  Here is an absolutely great, hard-rockin', kick-butt concert by Foreigner.  Never have they sounded so good!  They are a completely revamped Foreigner, headed by a terrific singer in Kelly Hansen (formerly from Hurricane).  Hansen did just as great a job as Lou Gramm in his prime -- he was able to hit all the notes and what's more -- he's got great presence on-stage.  Never has Mick Jones played so great --he was really jammin' on the solos and he played with renewed fire and vigor.  The band is terrific, especially with Jason Bonham on drums.  The bass player is great as well.  The mere fact that they're able to rouse the head-bangin' crowd in Germany with Foreigner songs indicates how special their performance is.  Foreigner is not exactly head-bangin' music -- but they play it like it is.  Some of the signature rock songs never sounded so great (e.g Double-Vision, Dirty White Boy, Feels Like the First Time, Urgent, Juke Box Hero, Hot Blooded).I wished they could have played a longer set but they were only given 60 minutes on stage. (Besides, the head-bangin' crowd wouldn't respond well to songs like ""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" or ""I Want to Know What Love Is"").  Well, if this is the new Foreigner, I'm excited about what they will do next.  This is the Foreigner we've all longed for -- singing and playing with new energy and passion.The Special Features offer candid and insightful interviews with Mick Jones, Kelly Hansen, and Jason Bonham.  They give their insights on how this all came together and how they feel playing on the road.If you're a Foreigner fan, run out and buy this DVD!  It is even better than the Foreigner -- Live at Deer Creek.

This was understandable because they were playing at a head-banger concert in Germany in front of thousands of teenagers who never heard of them.
