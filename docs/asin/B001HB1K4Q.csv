1199798,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001HB1K4Q,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","What a huge disappointment this movie turned out to be.  Once I learned the premise of Blackout, I couldn't wait to see it - I love these movies where people are put in a terribly stressful and agonizing situation in which hope eventually dies.  Even though getting stuck in an elevator isn't quite the dangerous stuff of aFrozen, in which three skiers are trapped for days on a ski lift, that particular circumstance certainly ranks highly on my personal ""I hope this never happens to me"" list.  Just being trapped is bad enough, but then one of the three turns out to be a serial killer - that should turn the claustrophobic intensity up a few notches.  And then I saw that one of my favorite young actresses, Amber Tamblyn, was in the movie.  Yep, I was totally stoked for the Blackout experience.  When the movie got off to a slow and disjointed start, I didn't worry because I knew the fun wouldn't really begin until our three characters stepped into that elevator together.  Then they got on the elevator - and the fun still didn't begin.  After that, it didn't take long to realize that Blackout was going to be a great big dud, and even Amber Tamblyn was powerless to overcome such a bad script and method of presentation.Blackout has a myriad of problems.  For one thing, none of the characters are particularly likeable to begin with, even though we're given reasons - gradually, via ill-timed flashbacks - to sympathize with each of them.  Dr. Karl Maddox (Aiden Gillen) is a widower on his way to do something for his little girl before she arrives back home the next day.  Claudia (Amber Tamblyn) is dealing with the impending death of her beloved grandmother.  Tommy (Armie Hammer) is putting a plan into motion to remove his girlfriend from a bad situation at home.  Oh, these poor people - yet, for some reason (bad writing) I felt nothing for any of them.  I don't believe the group dynamics were ever adequately established (due in no small part to the flashback scenes destroying anything resembling a rhythm), and I found the eventual emergence of the killer's identity and murderous intentions to have taken place somewhat too abruptly.  Even the climactic, life and death moments of the film manufactured little in the way of thrills or suspense.  It all adds up to quite a disappointing viewing experience that never generated the atmosphere it needed in order to succeed.",2,"This elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor, if you know what I mean",1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,2396,"['What', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Once', 'learned', 'premise', 'Blackout', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'love', 'movies', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'put', 'terribly', 'stressful', 'agonizing', 'situation', 'hope', 'eventually', 'dies', 'Even', 'getting', 'stuck', 'elevator', ""n't"", 'quite', 'dangerous', 'stuff', 'aFrozen', 'three', 'skiers', 'are', 'trapped', 'days', 'ski', 'lift', 'particular', 'circumstance', 'certainly', 'highly', 'personal', 'hope', 'never', 'list', 'Just', 'being', 'trapped', 'bad', 'enough', 'then', 'one', 'three', 'out', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'should', 'turn', 'claustrophobic', 'intensity', 'up', 'few', 'notches', 'then', 'saw', 'one', 'favorite', 'young', 'actresses', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'was', 'movie', 'Yep', 'was', 'totally', 'stoked', 'Blackout', 'experience', 'When', 'movie', 'got', 'off', 'slow', 'disjointed', 'start', 'did', ""n't"", 'worry', 'knew', 'fun', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'begin', 'three', 'characters', 'stepped', 'elevator', 'together', 'Then', 'got', 'elevator', 'fun', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'begin', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realize', 'Blackout', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'big', 'dud', 'even', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'was', 'powerless', 'overcome', 'bad', 'script', 'method', 'presentation.Blackout', 'myriad', 'problems', 'one', 'thing', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'begin', 'even', ""'re"", 'given', 'reasons', 'gradually', 'ill-timed', 'flashbacks', 'sympathize', 'Dr.', 'Karl', 'Maddox', 'Aiden', 'Gillen', 'widower', 'way', 'do', 'something', 'little', 'girl', 'back', 'home', 'next', 'day', 'Claudia', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'dealing', 'impending', 'death', 'beloved', 'grandmother', 'Tommy', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'putting', 'plan', 'motion', 'remove', 'girlfriend', 'bad', 'situation', 'home', 'Oh', 'poor', 'people', 'yet', 'reason', 'bad', 'writing', 'felt', 'nothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'group', 'dynamics', 'were', 'ever', 'adequately', 'established', 'due', 'small', 'part', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'destroying', 'anything', 'resembling', 'rhythm', 'found', 'eventual', 'emergence', 'killer', 'identity', 'murderous', 'intentions', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'somewhat', 'too', 'abruptly', 'Even', 'climactic', 'life', 'death', 'moments', 'film', 'manufactured', 'little', 'way', 'thrills', 'suspense', 'up', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'viewing', 'experience', 'never', 'generated', 'atmosphere', 'needed', 'order', 'succeed']",Blackout

1199801,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B001HB1K4Q,J from NY,"[0, 2]","""Black Out"" is a better film than I anticipated, renting it from Redbox on a whim.  There really isn't much of a mystery to the film as it is advertised--you find out who the killer is within barely half an hour.  If director Robert Castaneda intended it to be a big shock, he must have a had a few too many cups of coffee while making the film.Three people--Claudia (Amber Tamblyn), Karl (Aidan Gillen), and angry looking teen Tommy (Armie Hammer) get stuck in a hotel elevator during a city blackout. Before this happens and the elevator collapses, we see the fairly suspicious activities of each character during the day.  One of them is clearly a psychopathic murderer but it is unclear which one.  Not for long.You really have to admire Aidan Gillen's ability to play the grimiest sleazeballs known to man with such distant flair--he can go in about thirty seconds from being the nice, factory made man of society to the scariest motherf**ker alive in about thirty seconds.  His role here recalls his role in ""Less Than Zero"" maximized by about 100 in terms of depravity.What doesn't work about the film is the absurd insistence that there is no ""fate"" or, as a doctor says at the end of the film, ""I've never detected any pattern in any of these tragedies..""  Really?  The reason most of the very sad things happen in this movie is because of the will of one irredeemably sick individual, not fate.  One actually gets the idea that Castaneda sympathizes with the killer's philosophy.Still, Castaneda puts most FX created monsters to shame with this movie.  You will never forget the killer's performance or how he is slowly revealed.  A worthwhile if slightly poisonous movie.This only deserves three stars.  I have tried to alter the rating I've given several times.

Schultz,"[2, 4]","If a good thriller calls for isolating a group of people with a killer in their midst - the scriptwriters of this film found the ultimate setting. Three people are trapped in an elevator here. And one of them is a serial killer.However, this is no slasher-thriller. It's a more intelligent psychological thriller with an emphasis on character. Actually, I think this movie has an even better premise and unfolds in a more interesting way than its producers intended.There's no full Director's commentary on this DVD. However, there are interviews with all the people primarily involved in the making of ""Blackout."" These people seem unanimous in thinking their movie is about ""fate"" or ""destiny."" They see the finger of fate at work in the fact that their movie's three lead characters all have unusually urgent reasons for getting where they are going - yet find themselves infuriatingly bound inside the elevator. I can't see the sense of that. It could be said that any three people being trapped together in a dangerous dynamic would similarly represent fate at work. Or more generally, any of the trillions upon trillions of daily, shifting configurations of people, things, and events could be designated ""fate.""No, I think the value of this movie is in the way it limns the obsession of a serial killer. There have been so many movies and TV episodes featuring ever more far-fetched serial killers. But this film makes the viewer feel what must surely be the arrogance, the hatred, and the ravening, voluptuous intensity of most real serial killers.You can tell ""Blackout"" is going to be something special with its opening credits.

""Blackout"" clearly wants to be a psychological thriller between Claudia, Karl and Tommy, perhaps something riveting like Polanski's ""Death and the Maiden."" But there is little dramatic tension in interactions between the three characters. After all, all they can do is wait in, or attempt to get out the elevator.However, the main storyline about the three characters in a stalled elevator is frequently interrupted by flashbacks (revealing what they had been doing prior to the elevator accident), so the inside of the elevator car looks hardly claustrophobic. Also, because of this heavy-handed narrative, we don't feel the lapse of time, which should be one of the key factors in creating tension.
