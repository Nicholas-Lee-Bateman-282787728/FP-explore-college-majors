It was a very hard lesson they had to learn in order to stay alive.  Another movie was made of this called ""Three Came Home"" staring Claudette Colbert.  Both Claudette and Glenn Close played their parts very well, even though filmed well over 50 or more years apart.  It is a sad movie of harsh treatment of both American and British women who were not used to making do with very little food and almost no medical supplies. Those who made it until released had to have been changed forever.  The women worked together to do a beautiful vocal performance, more for themselves to keep up their spirits but, even their guards enjoyed.  See this movie and it to will leave a lasting impression upon you.  There was no ""Paradise Road"".  There were women functioning under a great deal of hardship.  Some even had their young children with them when captured.  I'm 72 and I remembered seeing ""Three Came Home"" as a small child with my mom.

This group of women cope with their ordeal by forming a glee club of sorts and humming tunes from classical composers amid the horrors of the Japanese who torment them. Sound familiar ? If you think this sound like ""Playing for Time"" it does. Or if you think ""Bridge Over River Kwai"" then you are right again. The problem is, ""Paradise Road"" can't touch those films. Overly long and overwrought, the story is awash in setting but has little point. Director Bruce Beresford keeps the talented Cast looking earnest but never really hitting a nerve. Cate Blanchett, Pauline Collins, and Frances McDormand are OK, but Glenn Close, perhaps one of our greatest Actresses, is not in her element here. No one plays strong, tough, or unhinged women better than Ms Close, but she does not do as well as a victim, which is what she is here.

159949,A2NJO6YE954DBH,079396041X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[42, 43]","Right before the fall of Singapore in February 1942 a group of women, predominantly English but also including Dutch, Australian, and other Western nationalities, were evacuated on ship to Australia. However, when the ship is sunk they are captured by the Japanese and put in an internment camp. Over the rest of the war they suffer the attendant horrors of being the prisoners of the Japanese and they rise above their condition by creating a vocal orchestra, a chorus that performs hummed renditions of the works of Mozart, Dvorak, and Ravel.There are certainly some memorable and harrowing moments in ""Paradise Road"" reflecting the brutality of life in a Japanese internment camp. Such horrors are supposed to stand in contrast to the beautiful music these women created in their prison camp by putting together a vocal orchestra. However, at the end of this 1999 film from director Bruce Beresford we learn that the vocal orchestra only performed for a couple of years before half its members had died, and we simply do not get the sense that things were that bad in this film, even though intellectually we know this must have been the case. As is pointed out, the Japanese do not like Europeans, prisoners, or women, and of course with these women we have all three. In contrast, one of the women refuses to hate her captors, explaining: ""I just can't bring myself to hate people. The worse they behave, the sorrier I feel for them.""I suppose it is politically incorrect today to show the brutality the Japanese displayed in dealing with prisoners. The concept of surrender was an anathema to the Japanese and soldiers who surrendered rather than die in battle or kill themselves were seen as being without honor. With Holocaust stories there is a distinction to be made between the Nazis and the Germans, but the culture and political history of the Japanese do not allow for such a distinction. In the film the brutality is reduced to a couple of key figures, Sergeant Tomiashi (Clyde Kusatsu), called ""The Snake"" by the women, and Captain Tanaka (Stan Egi), who are portrayed as being basically sadistic, although ""The Snake"" becomes a symbol of the possibility of redemption in the film. Sab Shimono is Colonel Hirota, the camp commander, but he has little to say until the end of the film and simply symbolizes the power that must be obeyed. The focal character on the Japanese side becomes his interpreter (David Chung), who reminds me of the herald in Euripides' ""Trojan Women"": the man who must announce policies of which he does not approve.It is important that the vocal orchestra be seen as an attempt to create grace and beauty in the depth of Hell, and not simply as a response to the long years of mind numbing prison labor. But I think that the extent to which that key connection is recognized in this film is up to the willingness of the audience to couch it that way. I also find myself wishing that there was more of the vocal orchestra performing (the music is performed using the original scores, which survived the war), and must admit I was survived there was not at least one montage contrasting the gloriously beautiful music with the indignities of life in that camp.The one area where there is no room for complaint is in the stellar ensemble cast of actresses, most of whom appear for most of the film without makeup (in the everyday sense of the word). Glenn Close bring a strong sense of resolve and reserve to the role of the orchestra's conductor, Adrienne Pargiter, aided by Pauline Collins as Margaret Drummond, a missionary who is able to recreate the necessary sheet music from memory. Even without the makeup many of the faces are recognizable: Cate Blanchett plays Susan Macarthy, a nurse, Julianna Margulies is the American Topsy Merritt, who is tempted by the relative life of luxury offered to women who agree to be prostitutes for the Japanese, Jennifer Ehle is Rosemary Leighton-Jones, longing for her husband, Elizabeth Spriggs is Mrs. Roberts, who cares more about her status and dog than her daughters or anyone else, Wendy Hughes is the stoic Mrs. Dickson, Johanna ter Steege is Sister Wilhelminia, who wanted to be an engineer and not a nun, and Frances McDormand is Dr. Verstak, a German Jew who escaped the Nazis only to become the guest of their Eastern allies.In the end ""Paradise Road"" is not as memorable as I might have hoped, but it is certainly worth watching and should not be dismissed as simply being a counterpart of sorts to the ""Playing for Time,"" about the orchestra comprised of Jewish women at Auschwitz. Even if it is inadequate to the task of creating truly transcendent moments, we certainly can understand and appreciate that once upon a time, in the real world, a group of real women actually achieved such moments.",4,A woman's vocal orchestra in a Japanese internment camp,1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,4792,"['Right', 'fall', 'Singapore', 'February', '1942', 'group', 'women',

159952,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,079396041X,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked this film, although I can not really say it is a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.""Paradise Road"" tells the story of a large group of European, Australian and American women captured by the Japanese in 1941-42 and imprisoned in Belalau concentration camp (officially called an internment camp - but we soon learn enough to know better) on Sumatra. It is based on true story of women such as young Dutch student Helen Colijn, British missionary Margaret Dryburgh and Australian military nurses Betty Jeffrey, Vivian Bullwinkel, Pat Darling and Wilma Oram. Memories written by Helen Colijn (""Song of survival"") and Betty Jeffrey (""White coolies"") provided most of the scenario. The film describes all the period from early 1942, when the inmates arrive at the camps, to the September 1945, when the camp is liberated by allied forces.Australian veteran director Bruce Beresford gathered for this film quite en ensemble cast - Glenn Close, Cate Blanchett, Julianna Margulies, Jennifer Ehle and Frances McDormand, to name just those most known - and put all this combined talent to REALLY good use. I especially liked the performance by Julianna Margulies, who actually outstaged Glenn Close, cast as main hero of the film...This is a very watchable film, stepping proudly in the traces of its predecessors such as ""Three came home"", ""A town like Alice"" and of course ""Tenko"" series. Its particularity lies in the description of prisoners ""orchestra"" or rather chorus, which, under the direction of Margaret Dryburgh (in this film renamed Margaret Drummond), really performed classical music for inmates and even the Japanese guards from 1943 to 1945. ""Paradise road"" includes especially an incredible rendering of Dvorak's largo from ""New World"" symphony - for obvious reasons it is of course not the best ever, but it is the most touching I ever heard...There is however one thing which makes it impossible for me to give this quite good film five stars - the director deliberately watered down the violence those brave women were exposed to and especially Japanese atrocities. Yes, there is one execution scene in this film, and starvation, disease and despair take their toll - but the real horror of Japanese concentration camps is NOT shown here. In fact, this film is so soft, that even the old ""Three came home"" made in 1950 (with Claudette Colbert as main star), shows more violence towards women... Honestly, I think that by deliberately censoring his own film and choosing to ignore almost all violence described by Helen Colijn and Betty Jeffrey, the director hurt ""Paradise Road""...But still, this is a good film, with five great actresses in very unusual roles giving a great show and with some very touching and dramatic scenes. At 122 minutes this is a long film, but it doesn't feel long at all. A recommended viewing - but if you want to learn more about how horrible was the fate of women captured or enslaved by Japanese from 1941 to 1945, you can read the original memories by Helen Colijn and Betty Jeffrey and also - warmly recommended - those two books: ""The real Tenko. Extraordinary True Stories of Women Prisoners of the Japanese"" by Mark Felton and especially ""The Comfort Women. Japan's Brutal Regime of Enforced Prostitution in the Second World War"" by George Hicks.",4,"""People the Japanese despise the most are Europeans and prisoners then women"" ""Well, that's us.

When saddled with a mediocre script, even one he wrote himself, his films suffer, despite their excellent cinematography and earnest acting. ""Paradise Road"" falls into the latter category, which is a shame because it has much going for it. Glenn Close leads a band of familiar faces, including Cate Blanchett and a strangely Dracula-like Frances McDormand, all prisoners of the Japanese on a remote island during WWII. The women face the usual hardships--loneliness, starvation, disease, torture--while spiritedly resisting the efforts of the evil Japanese to squash their resolve, which includes forming a vocal orchestra that beautifully performs some of my favorite pieces (""Bolero""; ""Danny Boy""). Chances are, though, you've seen it all before in one form or another. The well-intentioned performances range from caricature (McDormand) to please-send-me-my-Oscar (Close), though we never get to the know their characters all that deeply, even with the theatrics. The Japanese characters suffer more, as they're stock types from every WWII movie you've ever seen, with a ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" wannabe commandant (Sab Shimono), the sympathetic, but immasculated go-between (David Chung) and the requisite sadist (Stan Egi). In fact, it's hard to watch the film without seeing echoes of ""yellow horde"" paranoia, as this spitfire group of white women ably thwart the best efforts of a race of villainous little men. Unlike ""Shindler's List"" or ""Sophie's Choice,"" which at least tried to explore the nature of the captors, ""Paradise Road"" is content that they are simply villains or, at best, misled, missing golden opportunities to take the plot to higher levels. Despite some moving scenes--a camp concert and the gruesome death of a sympathetic secondary character among them--the film falls short of its potential dramatically, true story or not.",3,Wish I Could Like It More,1006646400,"11 25, 2001",2001,1967,"['When', 'given', 'good', 'script', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'fine', 'director', 'witness', 'Breaker', 'Morant', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'When', 'saddled', 'mediocre', 'script', 'even', 'one', 'wrote', 'films', 'suffer', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'earnest', 'acting', 'Paradise', 'Road', 'latter', 'category', 'shame', 'much', 'going', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'band', 'familiar', 'including', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'strangely', 'Dracula-like', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'prisoners', 'Japanese', 'remote', 'island', 'WWII', 'women', 'face', 'usual', 'hardships', 'loneliness', 'starvation', 'disease', 'torture', 'spiritedly', 'resisting', 'efforts', 'evil', 'Japanese', 'squash', 'resolve', 'forming', 'vocal', 'orchestra', 'beautifully', 'favorite', 'pieces', 'Bolero', 'Danny', 'Boy', 'Chances', 'are', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'form', 'well-intentioned', 'performances', 'range', 'caricature', 'McDormand', 'please-send-me-my-Oscar', 'Close', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'deeply', 'even', 'theatrics', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'suffer', 'more', ""'re"", 'stock', 'types', 'WWII', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'wannabe', 'commandant', 'Sab', 'Shimono', 'sympathetic', 'immasculated', 'go-between', 'David', 'Chung', 'requisite', 'sadist', 'Stan', 'Egi', 'fact', 'hard', 'watch', 'film', 'seeing', 'echoes', 'yellow', 'horde', 'paranoia', 'spitfire', 'group', 'white', 'women', 'ably', 'thwart', 'best', 'efforts', 'race', 'villainous', 'little', 'men', 'Shindler', 'List', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'least', 'tried', 'explore', 'nature', 'captors', 'Paradise', 'Road', 'content', 'are', 'simply', 'villains', 'best', 'misled', 'missing', 'golden', 'opportunities', 'take', 'plot', 'higher', 'levels', 'moving', 'scenes', 'camp', 'concert', 'gruesome', 'death', 'sympathetic', 'secondary', 'character', 'film', 'short', 'potential', 'dramatically', 'true', 'story', 'not']",Paradise Road VHS
159956,A27A3AZA7L12N6,079396041X,Stephen M. Bauer,"[11, 18]","This move is about civilian women and their children who were imprisoned by the Japanese armed forces during World War II.This movie affected me quite powerfully because I had read the book that was used as source material.  One of the female children who survived the prison camp lives here in New Jersey  and administers a juvenile reform facility.  In an interview in the local papers she described how she draws on her experience for perspective and how she tries to show her male, juvenile inmates how to adjust and succeed.  I clipped out the article and keep it between pages of the book.  My thoughts and feeling about the book and movie are too many and too complex for me to completely sort them out in a critical review.  What I offer here is a very crude sample of my reaction.  My focus here is more about the historical fact than about the art of the film.  Whereas the book is terribly moving, the film is not quite, but it is worth seeing.Few people know that during World War II, the Japanese had at least two prison camps where western, civilian women were kept.  One camp was in Burma and another in China.  The women were the wives of various businessmen, government employees, groups of nuns and Protestant missionaries.  They had stayed behind or were stranded when the war broke out.  Many of the women had their children with them in the camps.  They were from America, England, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands and other places.  There were a few Oriental and mixed race women and children also.  They tended to be the wives of diplomats or otherwise well connected to the wrong side.It happened that one of the women prisoners in the camp in Borneo, Agnes Newton Keith, was a professional author.  In the camp she secretly kept a diary, and when the war was over, she published a memoir, Three Came Home, describing her experiences.  It is a magnificent piece of writing, a minor classic in English literature.  The book, some letters, and interviews with survivors were the source material for Paradise Road.  There have been three previous movies from this material.  A movie titled, Three Came Home was made in 1950, and movies titled A Town Like Alice in 1956 and a remake in1981.In the film, the rivalry between the head of the camp and his subordinate are straight out of the book.  As characterized in the book, a few of the Japanese are decent human beings, but on the whole, though, they come across as completely ignorant and amoral.  They are young, dumb and don't want to be there.  The head of the prison had studied in the United States for a few years.  He had also read a book about Borneo that Ms. Keith had published before the war.  This connection helped her to survive.In the movie, as compared to the book, the individual acts of brutality and torture against the women are exaggerated.  One of the women was reported for smuggling, and she is tied up and forced to kneel over a sword for 24 hours.  In the book, Three Came Home nothing like this happened.  Smuggling items back and forth with the locals was a regular, ongoing activity.  Interestingly, some of the younger nuns became the best smugglers.  I can just see some young nun having the time of her life doing this!In the film, as you might expect, one of the Japanese guards tried to rape one of the women prisoners.  That part of the story was inspired by an event in the book, but in the book it was actually an incompetent attempt at seduction on the part of the guard.  The woman, Agnes Newton Keith herself, rebuffed him.  It became a big deal because she reported the incident as a rape attempt to the Japanese head of the camp.  The Japanese made a big stink about it; her accusation was considered an unthinkable affront to the honor of Japanese soldiers.In the movie a number of women chose to become prostitutes rather than live in the camp.  That never occurred in the book.I don't have a problem with the film showing greatly exaggerated acts of brutality.  The medium of film is very good at showing that sort of thing but not very good at showing the constant, day-after-day suffering from starvation for four years.  So it balances out.  Many died from malnutrition and disease.  That is only alluded to in the movie.  The one thing that stayed with me from the book was how much starvation Agnes Newton Keith was willing to suffer herself so that her son could eat a little more.  That was not depicted.  Her sacrifice was beyond heroic.  The filmmakers focused on the adult woman only, which I think was wrong.  With Agnes Newton Keith, probably the greatest amount of her mental energy and time was spent trying to acquire enough food for her son.I don't mean to be kind to the Japanese.  Close to the women's camp was a camp where the male civilians were kept, as well as some military prisoners.  They were beaten and tortured often.The center point and main symbol of the movie was choral singing that the women organized among themselves.  The choral singing in the movie is not in the book.In the book and the movie, there are a number of women with preposterous vanity.  Most of these women were from well-off backgrounds.  Many spent incredible amounts of time bemoaning the absence of men and the lack of cosmetics.  Some spend hours upon hours thinking about what dress they would wear when they are liberated.  In the camp cosmetics and dresses were bartered for various items.The women were optimistic.  They knew that some day the Americans would arrive, and they did.Within six weeks of the Japanese surrender, just about every Japanese officer from every prison camp was dead.  They committed suicide, were executed as war criminals, or just disappeared.  Ms. Keith relates an incident where, upon liberation, some Americans soldiers killed their former captors on the spot, with their bare hands.  If you read the book, you would have to pity for them.",3,Moving Film About A Little Known Part of WWII History,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,5901,"['move', 'civilian', 'women', 'children', 'who',

159957,A2U2ZXOOWFD76P,079396041X,"Vincent Yeh ""Vincent Yeh""","[3, 13]","Wars are ugly business, as anyone who's witnessed more than news headnlines will tell you.  Millions of innocent civilians have been murdered, tortured and raped throughout centuries.  Despite international conventions and condemnations, war crimes continue to be committed.  Something about wars make even the most civilized people do the most barbaric things. Perpetrators of war crimes will always justify their actions as strategic necessity.  The Japanese have absolutely no excuse for what they've done during WWII, and these atrocities deserve to be condemned by history, by the same standards that condemn all other war crimes.That being said, we Americans are in no position to point fingers at another country's dirty past.  We have a LONG list of war crimes consisting of mass murders, torture and rape of innocent civilians, and in fact, with victims vastly outnumbering those of Japanese war crimes.  Among them: torturing of Philippine POW in the 1920's; internment camp of Japanese Americans, mass murdering of German POW's, Hiroshima, in the 1940's; rampant murdering and rape in Vietnam; and very recently, torturing in Guantanomo.  These American atrocities have been well-documented, and some have been portrayed in Hollywood movies.But in documenting our own war crimes, Hollywood never goes beyond the documentation itself.  That is not the case in Paradise Road, which follows the same modus operandi of a long line of similar movies. Beyond documenting the historically accurate atrocities, Paradise Road seeks to paint all Japanese as an INHERENTLY evil, insecure, foolish, barbaric and effeminate race.  Even when a few directors portray our own war crimes - Oliver Stone for example - they do not use these crimes (murder, rape) to leave the impression that Americans are fundamentally evil.  Why is that?Paradise Road portrays the choir ladies as uniquely victimized by a uniquely despicable people.  If you study history, you will find Japanese war crimes are not unique. The only thing that's unique about Japanese war crimes is that they have been uniquely singled out to be repeatedly portrayed, and done in such a way as to suggest that they as a people are evil by nature.  Where are the movies depicting the Americans, the Serbs, the Sudanese or the Russians as fundamentally despicable people, because they committed horrific war crimes in the past?Paradise Road employs a dishonest way to evoke sympathy.  More importantly, it falls in a long line of movies that promote unspoken phobias about the ""yellow horde"".  In short, it is a reflection of racial biases that continue to exist in our society.",1,Racial Biases Justified,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,2635,"['Wars', 'are', 'ugly', 'business', 'anyone', 'who', 'witnessed', 'more', 'news', 'headnlines', 'will', 'tell', 'Millions', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'tortured', 'raped', 'centuries', 'international', 'conventions', 'condemnations', 'war', 'crimes', 'continue', 'be', 'committed', 'Something', 'wars', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'civilized', 'people', 'do', 'most', 'barbaric', 'things', 'Perpetrators', 'war', 'crimes', 'will', 'always', 'justify', 'actions', 'strategic', 'necessity', 'Japanese', 'have', 'absolutely', 'excuse', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'WWII', 'atrocities', 'deserve', 'be', 'condemned', 'history', 'same', 'standards', 'condemn', 'other', 'war', 'crimes.That', 'being', 'said', 'Americans', 'are', 'position', 'point', 'fingers', 'country', 'dirty', 'past', 'have', 'LONG', 'list', 'war', 'crimes', 'consisting', 'mass', 'murders', 'torture', 'rape', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'fact', 'victims', 'vastly', 'outnumbering', 'Japanese', 'war', 'crimes', 'torturing', 'Philippine', 'POW', '1920', 'internment', 'camp', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'mass', 'murdering', 'German', 'POW', 'Hiroshima', '1940', 'rampant', 'murdering', 'rape', 'Vietnam', 'very', 'recently', 'torturing', 'Guantanomo', 'American', 'atrocities', 'have', 'been', 'well-documented', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'Hollywood', 'movies.But', 'documenting', 'own', 'war', 'crimes', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'documentation', 'not', 'case', 'Paradise', 'Road', 'same', 'modus', 'operandi', 'long', 'line', 'similar', 'movies', 'documenting', 'historically', 'accurate', 'atrocities', 'Paradise', 'Road', 'paint', 'Japanese', 'INHERENTLY', 'evil', 'insecure', 'foolish', 'barbaric', 'effeminate', 'race', 'Even', 'when', 'few', 'directors', 'portray', 'own', 'war', 'crimes', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'example', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'crimes', 'murder', 'rape', 'leave', 'impression', 'Americans', 'are', 'fundamentally', 'evil', 'Why', 'Paradise', 'Road', 'choir', 'uniquely', 'victimized', 'uniquely', 'despicable', 'people', 'study', 'history', 'will', 'find', 'Japanese', 'war', 'crimes', 'are', 'not', 'unique', 'only', 'thing', 'unique', 'Japanese', 'war', 'crimes', 'have', 'been', 'uniquely', 'singled', 'out', 'be', 'repeatedly', 'portrayed', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'suggest', 'that', 'people', 'are', 'evil', 'nature', 'Where', 'are', 'movies', 'depicting', 'Americans', 'Serbs', 'Sudanese', 'Russians', 'fundamentally', 'despicable', 'people', 'committed', 'horrific', 'war', 'crimes', 'past', 'Paradise', 'Road', 'dishonest', 'way', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'More', 'importantly', 'long', 'line', 'movies', 'promote', 'unspoken', 'phobias', 'yellow', 'horde', 'short', 'reflection', 'racial', 'biases', 'continue', 'exist', 'society']",Paradise Road VHS
