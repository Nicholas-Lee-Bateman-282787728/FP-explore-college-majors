547046,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00004CMAZ,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","The Cockleshell Heroes, 1956 filmThe Royal Marines were given the job of attacking ships in the Bordeaux harbor. Airplanes could not be used for bombing because of the dangers to civilians. The plan was to use canoes bor a stealthy night time attack on the harbored ships. The Major plans a difficult test to weed out the under qualified. The volunteers will be dressed in enemy uniforms and dropped 350 miles away, they must return to base in 48 hours. We see how they try. [Some humor here.] Only eight came through; they can think for themselves. There is a conflict between the Major and the Captain. The Captain explains the failure of the infiltration test. The training will be done over to correct the mistakes. The team climbs up a vertical wall using ropes, then descends the same way. They paddle their canoes into the sea. They handle limpet mines for practice. The schedule is set.The Royal Marines celebrate the end of their training at a bar. One man takes a short leave for a situation not uncommon in wartime. ""Very quiet"" says the constable. The operation begins, they will be landed on the coast of France. An enemy destroyer drops depth charges against their submarine. Captain Thompson volunteers to replace an injured man. They paddle to the shore to avoid the mine fields. One boat upsets, the men are captured. Will they talk? The others hide by day. A dog runs by, will they be discovered? They reach the harbor and paddle through the entrance. A sentry fires a warning shot. The enemy searches for them in daylight and at night. Another crew is discovered and shot. The search intensifies. The volunteers place the limpet mines on the ships, all timed to go off at the same time. Another crew is discovered and captured; they won't talk either. The captured Royal Marines are shot as saboteurs.""Keep the line straight, boys"" is Captains Thompson's last order. But the explosions on the ships tell of a successful mission.This is a good story but the pacing seems off. It was adapted from a book that told the history of this operation. Would the bombing of targets be avoided in the future because of collateral damage?",5,One Operation in the War,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,2145,"['Cockleshell', 'Heroes', '1956', 'filmThe', 'Royal', 'Marines', 'were', 'given', 'job', 'attacking', 'ships', 'Bordeaux', 'harbor', 'Airplanes', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'bombing', 'dangers', 'civilians', 'plan', 'was', 'use', 'canoes', 'bor', 'stealthy', 'night', 'time', 'attack', 'harbored', 'ships', 'Major', 'difficult', 'test', 'weed', 'out', 'qualified', 'volunteers', 'will', 'be', 'dressed', 'enemy', 'uniforms', 'dropped', '350', 'miles', 'away', 'must', 'return', 'base', '48', 'hours', 'see', 'how', 'try', '[', 'humor', 'here', 'Only', 'eight', 'came', 'can', 'think', 'conflict', 'Major', 'Captain', 'Captain', 'failure', 'infiltration', 'test', 'training', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'correct', 'mistakes', 'team', 'up', 'vertical', 'wall', 'using', 'ropes', 'then', 'same', 'way', 'paddle', 'canoes', 'sea', 'handle', 'limpet', 'mines', 'practice', 'schedule', 'set.The', 'Royal', 'Marines', 'celebrate', 'end', 'training', 'bar', 'One', 'man', 'short', 'leave', 'situation', 'not', 'uncommon', 'wartime', 'Very', 'quiet', 'constable', 'operation', 'will', 'be', 'landed', 'coast', 'France', 'enemy', 'destroyer', 'depth', 'charges', 'submarine', 'Captain', 'Thompson', 'volunteers', 'replace', 'injured', 'man', 'paddle', 'shore', 'avoid', 'mine', 'fields', 'One', 'boat', 'upsets', 'men', 'are', 'captured', 'talk', 'others', 'hide', 'day', 'dog', 'runs', 'will', 'be', 'discovered', 'reach', 'harbor', 'paddle', 'entrance', 'sentry', 'warning', 'shot', 'enemy', 'searches', 'daylight', 'night', 'crew', 'discovered', 'shot', 'search', 'intensifies', 'volunteers', 'place', 'limpet', 'mines', 'ships', 'timed', 'go', 'off', 'same', 'time', 'crew', 'discovered', 'captured', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'either', 'captured', 'Royal', 'Marines', 'are', 'shot', 'saboteurs', 'Keep', 'line', 'straight', 'boys', 'Captains', 'Thompson', 'last', 'order', 'explosions', 'ships', 'tell', 'successful', 'mission.This', 'good', 'story', 'pacing', 'off', 'was', 'adapted', 'book', 'told', 'history', 'operation', 'Would', 'bombing', 'targets', 'be', 'avoided', 'future', 'collateral', 'damage']",The Cockleshell Heroes VHS

547049,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00004CMAZ,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 5]","Twelve Royal Marines in December, 1942, were deposited by sub with their six kayaks at the mouth of the Gironde estuary. Their mission was to paddle in the middle of winter for three days, upriver at night and laying low during the day, until they reached the docks of Bordeaux. There, they would attach limpet mines to German shipping, blow up or damage as many ships as possible, then escape overland and eventually return to Britain.Any volunteers? (And read no further if you don't like conclusions.) Of the six two-man teams, only two Marines made it back. One kayak was damaged getting it in the water and these two men remained on the sub. One kayak capsized and the two men drowned. One kayak became separated and the two men were captured and immediately shot by the Germans. Another kayak became separated and then capsized. The two men were betrayed by the French, captured by the Germans and later shot. Two kayaks made it. The four men attached their mines and damaged several ships. The four men got to shore safely. Later, two were betrayed by the French and later shot by the Germans with their two comrades who had been captured earlier. Two men eventually made it back home.Did their raid make any difference to WWII? None, whatsoever. Cockleshell Heroes is based on this real story. It has its flaws, but, once we get to the ten men leaving the sub it builds excitement and tension. But it also underlines the extent to which brave and resourceful men and women in time of war can be called upon to undertake harebrained risks with little payoff, thought up or approved by enthusiastic senior commanders and their civilian bosses. In this case, we can thank our stars that the military direction of WWII was in the hands of men like Alan Brooke and George Marshall and not Louis Mountbatten, who is supposed to have thought the idea was splendid and gallant.Jose Ferrer, who also directed, stars as Major Stringer. The raid is his idea. He wants to build his two-man teams from men he can motivate and train unconventionally. He is a believer in trust. His second in command, Captain Thompson, played by Trevor Howard, is old-school. He's just as sure that discipline and pride must come first. Guess who's right. The movie's great flaw is the standard portrayal of the men as tough but rambunctious lower-class lads who need the firm but understanding leadership of their upper-class officers. Ferrer does a fine job as the smart, dedicated officer who gets off on the wrong foot with the men, but who proves himself just as brave and resourceful as they are. Trevor Howard, however, is the key to the movie...a soldier of the old school, a skeptical man and a professional soldier to his fingertips. ""Keep the line straight, boys,"" are his last, laconic words, and they pack an emotional wallop.The Region 2 DVD Technicolor transfer is just fine.",4,Brave men on a pointless mission.

Since it is all building towards a raid that should be a secret there is not much in the way of 'action' but the greatness of the film is that it is engaging just from the training and growth of the men as a unit.Jose Ferrer plays the marine major who comes up with the unconventional plan to attack German shipping in the heart of what they feel is an impregnable harbor. Beyond the damage done to the shipping itself, a raid that deep in German territory will make the Germans have to stretch their resources even further as they have to provide even more security in areas they thought were safe.Ferrer figures he needs bold adventurers for this wild plan and gives them a very free hand in training, not wanting to quash their feelings but as drills become shambolic messes he realizes he has to find a way to take a strong hand without crushing the spirit he needs. The result is wonderful.I have been looking for this film on DVD for years and to finally find it but in a formatt that is usless to me is heartbreaking.

Furthermore, a British commando on a kayak is spotted by a German sentry, who opens fire, and thereby further alerts the Germans.

547052,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00004CMAZ,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","The story told in this film was inspired by Operation ""Franton"", an incredibly daring raid by Royal Marines against German blockade runners anchored in Bordeaux in December 1942. Those ships were large and fast transports travelling (frequently under false flags) from France to Japan and back, carrying sophisticated industrial tools and optic and electronic equipments to the Japanese and bringing back supplies for Nazi war effort, mostly rubber, tin, tungstene and rare metals, precious even in limited amounts.This was a unique operation, during which the Marines were brought by a submarine to the mouth of Gironde estuary and then they had to travel by canoes to Bordeau and then attack German ships with limpet mines. Paddling up the Gironde would take four nights (commandos had to hide during the day), and therefore the whole operation lasted from 7 to 11 December. After the attack the Marines were to scuttle the canoes and travel by foot to meet with French Resistance agents, who would help them escape to neutral Spain.In ""Cockleshell Heroes"" the story is however a little bit amended. Names of the Royal Marines were changed and their characters were completely rewritten to make this film more interesting - and in some parts also more amusing. The key elements of the real story were respected - the operation takes place in December 1942, the target are indeed German blockade-runners in Bordeaux and the final results of the raid are the same in the film as in the real story. There were however may elements added, especially during the raid itself, to make the story more dramatic.The description of the selection of participants, their training and other preparations were also amended, but mostly by the inclusion of some of the real practices used to select and train British commandos and secret agents during World War II. Although there is no shortage of tragedy in this film (especially during the raid itself), some elements during the training are absolutely HILARIOUS!Jose Ferrer, who also directed this film, is excellent as the commander of the raid, but it is Trevor Howard who steals the show, as a bitter, somehow aged Royal Marines captain who was promoted only once in his long career and spend the last 20 years affected only to administrative jobs... Christopher Lee plays a little role in this film, as the commander of the British submarine HMS ""Tuna"".This film is not as good as ""Dambusters"" or ""Above us the waves"", but still I watched it with pleasure. Some comic elements included during the training can seem strange in a war movie, but I rather enjoyed them. The main reason for taking away one star is that this film lacks the tension and the nail-biting suspense which were so present in the two films mentioned earlier - and also because some elements added to the raid itself were a little bit exaggerated and poorly executed. Still, it is a film worth watching for all war movies amateurs.
