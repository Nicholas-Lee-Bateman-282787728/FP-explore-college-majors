960803,A8AD6PLQ0PPQE,B000CQM4Z6,"Anonymous ""booksandcookies""","[24, 35]","Well, in my house we're down to the last two episodes of The Complete Fourth Season. Just as with the first three season DVDs, we've carefully parceled out the episodes for viewing because we know how unbearably long it is between releases of these DVDs. Sometimes we splurge and watch two episodes in a row. Now, however, we are down to two remaining and once again, I've taken to scanning the Amazon website for any sign of the next DVD in the series only to find disappointment. Why does it take so long between releases of the next season on DVD? Why??This is the very best television there ever was - yes, that's right: ever. Do not miss the opportunity to bring the little discs which preserve this television series right into your own home, whether they are encased in parkas (seasons 1-3) or not.To those who, DVD release after DVD release, keep carping about the music, I say: please stop. Your point has been made - and made and made. There is nothing to be done about that issue. It is possible that you are affecting sales of the DVDs with your repetitiously negative comments about the music and that would be a terrible shame. The music was what it was and is what it is. Either way, it is wonderful, delightful music accompanying the best television show ever. You are looking at it with the eyes of nostalgia (""things can never be as good as they were; I miss how things were..."")  versus looking with child's eyes (""isn't this wonderful!"")I appreciate art as much as the next guy and don't want it ""messed with"" but, you know, Venus used to have arms. Would you rather not see a work at all because you can't see it the way it once was? That is a rigid nostalgia, isn't it? I agree with your point essentially, but what can you do about it? I also hated - and still hate - the Ted Turner colorization of the great old movies and when I have a choice, I only go for the black and white version. We don't have a choice with these Northern Exposure DVDs and anyway, the fact is that the music on the DVDs is still very good.It's an extraordinarily wonderful show, in its original form and now on these DVDs. In my opinion the ONLY problem with these DVDs is that they are so very slow to be released.",5,Need more,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2215,"['Well', 'house', ""'re"", 'down', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'Just', 'first', 'three', 'season', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'carefully', 'parceled', 'out', 'episodes', 'viewing', 'know', 'how', 'unbearably', 'long', 'releases', 'DVDs', 'Sometimes', 'splurge', 'watch', 'two', 'episodes', 'row', 'Now', 'however', 'are', 'down', 'two', 'remaining', 'once', 'again', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'scanning', 'Amazon', 'website', 'sign', 'next', 'DVD', 'series', 'only', 'find', 'disappointment', 'Why', 'take', 'so', 'long', 'releases', 'next', 'season', 'DVD', 'Why', 'very', 'best', 'television', 'there', 'ever', 'was', 'yes', 'right', 'ever', 'Do', 'not', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'little', 'discs', 'preserve', 'television', 'series', 'right', 'own', 'home', 'are', 'encased', 'parkas', 'seasons', '1-3', 'who', 'DVD', 'release', 'DVD', 'release', 'keep', 'carping', 'music', 'say', 'please', 'stop', 'point', 'been', 'made', 'made', 'made', 'nothing', 'be', 'done', 'issue', 'possible', 'are', 'affecting', 'sales', 'DVDs', 'repetitiously', 'negative', 'comments', 'music', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'shame', 'music', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'what', 'way', 'wonderful', 'delightful', 'music', 'accompanying', 'best', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'are', 'looking', 'eyes', 'nostalgia', 'things', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'were', 'miss', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'looking', 'child', 'eyes', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'appreciate', 'art', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'messed', 'know', 'Venus', 'used', 'have', 'arms', 'Would', 'rather', 'not', 'see', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'once', 'was', 'rigid', 'nostalgia', ""n't"", 'agree', 'point', 'essentially', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'also', 'hated', 'still', 'hate', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'colorization', 'great', 'old', 'movies', 'when', 'have', 'choice', 'only', 'go', 'black', 'white', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'DVDs', 'anyway', 'fact', 'music', 'DVDs', 'still', 'very', 'good.It', 'extraordinarily', 'wonderful', 'show', 'original', 'form', 'now', 'DVDs', 'opinion', 'ONLY', 'problem', 'DVDs', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'slow', 'be', 'released']",N/A

Anyway, that is a small complaint for what was a great series, even if it started to drag a bit in the fourth season.  Joel's anxieties get the better of him, and too many episodes focus on his extended internment and antagonistic relationship with Maggie.  I wasn't sure what to make of Mike Monroe, either at the time of the show's airing or now.  I think they got about as much mileage out of his allergy fixations as they could get, with Mike at one point parading down the main street of Cicely in Maurice's old space suit.  Of course, he was the perfect foil for Maggie, who finally had a man sensitive to her wants and needs, but alas Mike had bigger ambitions once Maggie had cured him of his allergies.What really makes the show click in my mind is the evergrowing set of relationship between Marilyn, Ed, Dave the Cook and the expanding Native American community.  One of the funniest episodes is when Adam Ant comes to town and tries to do a world music project with the Indians, which Ed dutifully films in black and white.  However, the signature episode of this season has to be Marilyn's trip to Seattle, where Joel goes chasing after her, thinking she is ill-equipped to handle the big city.  That episode really cemented their relationship and revealed Joel to be a very compassionate, if over-wrought, character.Along the way we get the return of Adam, the gourmet, as Maurice plans another one of his self-indulgent feasts, Holling trying to plant a seed, and Chris introduces Bernard to the world of fisticuffs, both physical and metaphysical, while still spinning his memorable tunes.  Great series but you can see it is drawing to its end in the way Falsey and Brand seem to treat each episode as if it will be their last.",4,Northern Exposure begins to feel its age,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,1924,"[""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'box', 'no', 'longer', 'come', 'little', 'parkas', 'then', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'amazon', ""n't"", 'ship', 'exactly', 'same', 'product', 'overseas', 'do', 'domestically', 'Anyway', 'small', 'complaint', 'what', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'even', 'started', 'drag', 'bit', 'fourth', 'season', 'Joel', 'anxieties', 'get', 'better', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'focus', 'extended', 'internment', 'antagonistic', 'relationship', 'Maggie', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'Mike', 'Monroe', 'either', 'time', 'show', 'airing', 'now', 'think', 'got', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'mileage', 'allergy', 'fixations', 'could', 'get', 'Mike', 'one', 'point', 'parading', 'down', 'main', 'street', 'Cicely', 'Maurice', 'old', 'space', 'suit', 'course', 'was', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Maggie', 'who', 'finally', 'had', 'man', 'sensitive', 'needs', 'alas', 'Mike', 'had', 'bigger', 'ambitions', 'once', 'Maggie', 'had', 'cured', 'really', 'show', 'click', 'mind', 'evergrowing', 'set', 'relationship', 'Marilyn', 'Ed', 'Dave', 'Cook', 'expanding', 'Native', 'American', 'community', 'One', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'when', 'Adam', 'Ant', 'town', 'tries', 'do', 'world', 'music', 'project', 'Indians', 'Ed', 'dutifully', 'black', 'white', 'However', 'signature', 'episode', 'season', 'be', 'Marilyn', 'trip', 'Seattle', 'where', 'Joel', 'chasing', 'thinking', 'ill-equipped', 'handle', 'big', 'city', 'episode', 'really', 'cemented', 'relationship', 'revealed', 'Joel', 'be', 'very', 'compassionate', 'over-wrought', 'character.Along', 'way', 'get', 'return', 'Adam', 'gourmet', 'Maurice', 'one', 'self-indulgent', 'feasts', 'Holling', 'trying', 'plant', 'seed', 'Chris', 'introduces', 'Bernard', 'world', 'fisticuffs', 'physical', 'metaphysical', 'still', 'spinning', 'memorable', 'tunes', 'Great', 'series', 'can', 'see', 'drawing', 'end', 'way', 'Falsey', 'Brand', 'seem', 'treat', 'episode', 'will', 'be', 'last']",N/A

960828,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000CQM4Z6,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","Most everyone knows the controversy over the release of Northern Exposure on DVD but for those who do not, some (but not all) of the original music from the show has been replaced with canned music.  This occurs mostly in the radio station scenes, but happens in some of the others as well.  A big  sticking point when it comes to releasing older shows on DVD is getting the rights to the music. NE is certainly not the only show that has lost some of the music that was in the show when it aired, but unlike some other shows where music was just on in the background, it was very much a part of many of the scenes and was used to help tell the story. Reality is that Universal could not just release the DVDs with all original music without getting permission from all the rights holders to all the songs. If they did they would be sued. Modern day shows do not really have this issue because the DVD sets are released almost immediately after the season ends, but some shows that predated DVD have run into the problem with losing music.The big controversy when the first couple seasons got released on DVD was the high cost (especially since there were so few episodes) because they paid for the rights to all the songs and passed it on to the consumer. Now yes, you can be mad that Universal was too cheap to continue to pay whatever it took to get all the songs, but these days the only way to see the show is in this format. It is not on in syndication any longer, so unless you taped it on VHS years ago there is no other way to see it. So you have to make the choice about whether not having all the music will ruin your enjoyment of the show to an extent that you could never watch it any other way.If you can get around the music issue, either because you do not remember the original songs, or it just does not make you as mad as it does some, the season is great.  It focused much more on the various residents of the town (partly because of the contract dispute between Rob Morrow and the producers) and introduced a new recurring character, Mike Monroe (played by Anthony Edwards) to balance out some of Morrow's lost screen time, and provide a love interest for Maggie.  This of course created the love triangle between Joel, Maggie and Mike that was needed to put off the coupling of the two main characters as long as possible.  The character did not last very long because Edwards would go off to start making ER the next year.Ironically this was the season where almost every character besides Joel developed in some way.  Because of Morrow's reduced screen time, his character really just seemed stuck in the same place he had always been, even regressing some.  By the end of the third season Joel had begun to warm to being in Alaska, but during this season (after he was informed that he would be required to stay a 5th year) it was back to Joel hating being there.  One thing that did come from that were more episodes that focused on the other characters, or the town's quirky nature.As for the DVDs themselves.  The 26 episodes are spread between 6 discs (all single sided fortunately unlike seasons 1 and 2 which had the dreaded double sided discs).  The bonus material again consists of deleted and extended scenes (although on far less episodes than in the prior seasons) and a couple different gag reels.  There are no commentary tracks, cast interviews or making of features.  What is there is pretty much on par with what was included as extras in the prior season set releases, just less of it.",5,Great if you can get around the music issue,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,3527,"['Most', 'everyone', 'controversy', 'release', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'DVD', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'not', 'original', 'music', 'show', 'been', 'replaced', 'canned', 'music', 'mostly', 'radio', 'station', 'scenes', 'others', 'well', 'big', 'sticking', 'point', 'when', 'releasing', 'older', 'shows', 'DVD', 'getting', 'rights', 'music', 'NE', 'certainly', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'lost', 'music', 'was', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'other', 'shows', 'where', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'background', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'many', 'scenes', 'was', 'used', 'help', 'tell', 'story', 'Reality', 'Universal', 'could', 'not', 'just', 'release', 'DVDs', 'original', 'music', 'getting', 'permission', 'rights', 'holders', 'songs', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'sued', 'Modern', 'day', 'shows', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'issue', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'released', 'almost', 'immediately', 'season', 'shows', 'predated', 'DVD', 'have', 'run', 'problem', 'losing', 'music.The', 'big', 'controversy', 'when', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'got', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'high', 'cost', 'especially', 'were', 'so', 'few', 'episodes', 'paid', 'rights', 'songs', 'passed', 'consumer', 'Now', 'yes', 'can', 'be', 'mad', 'Universal', 'was', 'too', 'cheap', 'continue', 'pay', 'took', 'get', 'songs', 'days', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'show', 'format', 'not', 'syndication', 'longer', 'taped', 'VHS', 'years', 'ago', 'other', 'way', 'see', 'have', 'make', 'choice', 'not', 'having', 'music', 'will', 'ruin', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'extent', 'could', 'never', 'watch', 'other', 'way.If', 'can', 'get', 'music', 'issue', 'either', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'original', 'songs', 'just', 'not', 'make', 'as', 'mad', 'season', 'great', 'focused', 'much', 'more', 'various', 'residents', 'town', 'partly', 'contract', 'dispute', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'producers', 'introduced', 'new', 'recurring', 'character', 'Mike', 'Monroe', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'balance', 'out', 'Morrow', 'lost', 'screen', 'time', 'provide', 'love', 'interest', 'Maggie', 'course', 'created', 'love', 'triangle', 'Joel', 'Maggie', 'Mike', 'was', 'needed', 'put', 'off', 'coupling', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'very', 'long', 'Edwards', 'would', 'go', 'off', 'start', 'making', 'ER', 'next', 'year.Ironically', 'was', 'season', 'where', 'almost', 'character', 'Joel', 'developed', 'way', 'Morrow', 'reduced', 'screen', 'time', 'character', 'really', 'just', 'seemed', 'stuck', 'same', 'place', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'even', 'regressing', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'Joel', 'had', 'begun', 'warm', 'being', 'Alaska', 'season', 'was', 'informed', 'would', 'be', 'required', 'stay', '5th', 'year', 'was', 'back', 'Joel', 'hating', 'being', 'there', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'come', 'were', 'more', 'episodes', 'focused', 'other', 'characters', 'town', 'quirky', 'nature.As', 'DVDs', '26', 'episodes', 'are', 'spread', '6', 'discs', 'single', 'sided', 'fortunately', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'had', 'dreaded', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'bonus', 'material', 'again', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'far', 'less', 'episodes', 'prior', 'seasons', 'couple', 'different', 'gag', 'reels', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'cast', 'interviews', 'making', 'features', 'What', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'what', 'was', 'included', 'extras', 'prior', 'season', 'set', 'releases', 'just', 'less']",N/A
960829,A1JSBJUHYULBNG,B000CQM4Z6,Old Dude,"[0, 0]","The Season 4 DVDs of Northern Exposure (in the light blue box) were the terrible double sided discs that were prone to skips and freeze ups. And of course the crucial musical soundtracks that made each episode special and helped define why this show was so great were (mostly) all stripped out. A painful fact that has been noted many times here by loyal fans. Is this new release of Season 4 due out this coming January 2014 anything really different or did they just change the look of the outer box the DVD discs come in? Does anyone know at this point? IF the re-issued Season 4 (one of the best seasons of one of TV's greatest and most critically honored shows) actually has most of the original music restored or even 90% of it and IF the DVD discs themselves are single sided (like the previously released Seasons 5 and 6 were) then YES I will buy this new Season 4 release gladly. This would finally be what all Northern Exposure fans have been asking for all these years - single sided discs with the original soundtracks restored. In fact, I will repurchase ALL 6 seasons over again if Universal is finally going to get this right and do justice to this highly acclaimed Emmy and Golden Globe winning show in which the music was such a critical element.

Some of the scripts seemed forced and just lacked the punch of most of those in the other seasons.  The guest actors ranged from lackluster to annoying, too. David Hemmings, the studly star of Antonio's BLOWUP, appears as a dissolute, fat, gray-haired old guy with huge bags under his eyes.  Valerie Perrine still looks good and bears a striking resemblance to Shelly.Joel seemed stuck in perpetual whinyness, especially when Maggie found a taller, cuter, nicer boyfriend.  Unfortunately he, the new bf, had environmental illness and had to live in a bubble, but that didn't bother Maggie who had a nice fling and a break from Joel. Chris had some nice moments, especially when he lit up the town for an art project; that was one of the seasons' few magic moments.  Another was when the town rallied around Joel to provide people to help him say the prayer of the dead for his favorite uncle.  Ed found his father, which was another beautiful moment.  And the Flying Man returned to beg Marilyn to marry him which was charming and moving.  Maurice had some breakthroughs of his usual crustiness to show a real heart.  Shelly discovers she's ""preggers"" and sings her way through the last show; some folks found this silly but I thought it was very well done.Even if this isn't the best season they've done, it's still head and shoulders above most TV shows and well worth watching.

I had issues with every season so far, but aside from the obvious fact that the important music is taken out, season 4 is all good. Seasons 1 and 2 were good, but way too expensive for being only half a season long each. Season 3 was the same price as the earlier seasons, but had twice as many episodes because season 3 was the first full season to air. But... season 3 had some synchronization issues. A lot of the sound effects were off, and the characters mouths didn't move in time with voice track. It was odd in season 3 to see someone set a glass on the bar and a full second later you'd hear the ""clunk"". Season 4 doesn't have those problems. It still has the problems with the music though that I'll never be able to get over. At least the Native American Indian song that plays when Marilyn goes to Seattle this season is still there on this DVD. I hope beyond hope that when it comes to the final season of Northern Exposure that they include the song ""Our Town"" that played at the end of the final episode. No other song can work there and have as big of an impact as that song did. The atmosphere of that song along with the lyrics are a perfect compliment to say goodbye to the cast of Northern Exposure with.I got the Freaks And Geeks DVD set last year from a friend. This show isn't nearly as popular as NX was and it only aired for half a season, yet the Freaks And Geeks DVD's were released with all of the original songs intact. And they had big name bands all throughout each episode... Kiss, Ted Nugent, Alice Cooper, Journey, and tons more.
