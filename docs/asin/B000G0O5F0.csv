Al Qasim,"[0, 0]","Elmo has always been one of my favourite Muppets for ages, I got this DVD for my young daughter who was about to begin potty training... we were having some trouble with getting her to accept the whole concept at first, but this DVD really made a difference!I guess there isn't much that Cookie Monster could teach kids besides eating their teeth rotten or eating their selves into a diabetic stroke!Let me explain what I mean when I say universal, my daughter is still not old enough to understand English, but she clearly got the message from this DVD and she kept saying ""I wanna go use the big girls potty like Elmo!"" Obviously she will appreciate the morals and lessons more as she understands the lingo but it seems to have worked.I have to admit that it wasn't like those many toddler programs where they drive the adults mad! It was actually a very well produced piece of work which was put together in a very fun style! Even I enjoyed it as an adult... I could appreciate how fun it would be for kids! I especially liked the part / song where kids count out the numerous words they use for poop! Kinda fun for kids... various words for poop still make older kids in the family giggle when they hear them!Overall, a fun and very useful tool for parents who are about to potty train their kids... just think if it can work with a kid who doesn't speak English yet, then it is bound to wok wonders with English speaking kids!",4,"Educational, Fun and Universal!",1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1431,"['Elmo', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favourite', 'Muppets', 'ages', 'got', 'DVD', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'begin', 'potty', 'training', 'were', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'accept', 'whole', 'concept', 'first', 'DVD', 'really', 'made', 'difference', 'guess', ""n't"", 'much', 'Cookie', 'Monster', 'could', 'teach', 'kids', 'eating', 'teeth', 'rotten', 'eating', 'selves', 'diabetic', 'stroke', 'Let', 'explain', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'universal', 'daughter', 'still', 'not', 'old', 'enough', 'understand', 'English', 'clearly', 'got', 'message', 'DVD', 'kept', 'saying', 'wan', 'na', 'go', 'use', 'big', 'girls', 'potty', 'Elmo', 'Obviously', 'will', 'appreciate', 'morals', 'lessons', 'more', 'lingo', 'have', 'worked.I', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'many', 'toddler', 'programs', 'where', 'drive', 'adults', 'mad', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'piece', 'work', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'fun', 'style', 'Even', 'enjoyed', 'adult', 'could', 'appreciate', 'how', 'fun', 'would', 'be', 'kids', 'especially', 'liked', 'part', '/', 'song', 'where', 'kids', 'count', 'out', 'numerous', 'words', 'use', 'poop', 'Kinda', 'fun', 'kids', 'various', 'words', 'poop', 'still', 'make', 'older', 'kids', 'family', 'giggle', 'when', 'hear', 'Overall', 'fun', 'very', 'useful', 'tool', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'potty', 'train', 'kids', 'just', 'think', 'can', 'work', 'kid', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'yet', 'then', 'bound', 'wok', 'wonders', 'English', 'speaking', 'kids']",Sesame Street - Elmo's Potty Time

We are in the very early stages of potty training, and since my son adores all Sesame Street characters, I thought this would be a good supplement to the training that his father and I give him.  I have to say that most parents are right to say that there is not a lot of actual ""potty footage,"" but I think that this video is more of a tool to encourage toddlers instead of a graphic ""how-to"" guide--isn't that our job?  The content presented here is highly positive words from Muppets that apparently potty like pros.  They discuss wearing diapers, listening to your body, having accidents, and of course, wiping, flushing and washing up.  There are segments that do not relate directly to using the potty, but the moral of those clips, I think, is that ""it takes time, but you can do anything with practice.""  I also really appreciate the fact that Elmo's dad is the parent in the show that talks about training with his son--I like to see daddies taking part in important milestones like this.  As for terms used to describe ""what you put in the potty,"" if you don't like them, teach your kids what YOU want them to say.  Unfortunately for all of you that cringe at a less than proper word being uttered in front of your child, you might as well get used to the idea--if you plan on letting your child spend any time with other kids, they are going to hear a lot worse than the word ""dookie.""

They understood a good portion of it and it motivated them to use the potty, wash their hands, etc, though, so it definitely did it's job! I'm happy with it still!
