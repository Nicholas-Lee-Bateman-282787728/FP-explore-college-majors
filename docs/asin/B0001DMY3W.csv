It would have been nice not to see dancing from so many angles, not all of them focusing best on what the dancer is doing. I'd have preferred they just sat back and filmed the dancers so it'd be like viewing a live show from the audience, which more like how they did it on Bellydance Divas. But this is otherwise awesome.There are 8 or 9 dancers, and all get two numbers, except for one woman who does only one with a Marilyn costume, in awe of her shimmies. It's kind of silly but fun, too, though a true Marilyn fan may be offended or irritated. But the other dancing is fantastic. You see the slow, elegant and powerful movements of Rachel Brice in tribal costume, Jillina's fun and energy, and my personal favorite is Suhaila's first performance; it's a great dance and I love seeing how much fun she's having. It makes it all worthwhile. There are many others, and the dancing, music and costumes are all beautiful and amazing. Highly recommended for anyone who loves bellydance.

801745,AX4WI207ZA637,B0001DMY3W,Casey Snider,"[4, 5]","""Bellydance Superstars"" the DVD is the latest project from rock-impresario-turned-bellydance-fan Miles Copeland, and features many of the dancers from the ""Bellydance Superstars"" tour, including such luminaries as Ansuya, Rania, Rachel Brice, and Amar Gamal.  It's a great idea, but the reality falls short.I was fortunate enough to see the ""Bellydance Superstars"" live a few days after I got this DVD, and let me tell you something --- these women are unbelievable.  I left the show stoked and ready to dance.  It's a shame that the DVD doesn't really capture the incredible energy of the live performances; for some reason, it has the look more of a music video than a documentary, with weird high-angle shots down the dancers' cleavages, several moments when the cameraman seems to be peering around a large candleholder, and LOTS of loving closeups of disembodied sequined bosoms, undulating bellies, and shimmying backsides.  If you're a teenage boy, this is great.  If you're a student of bellydance looking for pointers, as I am, it's not.  There are several moments in which the camerawork is downright amateurish with dancers whirling out of the frame, heads being cut off, transitions being lost, and the camera jerking around as if the operator can't seem to figure out what he's supposed to be looking at.  Most of the time the dancers are visible only above mid-thigh, which makes you wonder what their feet are doing during traveling steps.  Personally, I think this video would have been better if it had been shot in the style of ""Bellydance Divas"", where you could see the whole dancer and exactly what she was doing.That being said, there is some fantastic dancing on this DVD.  I loved Ansuya's two numbers, as well as the offerings from Amar and Sonia, although I didn't think Rachel's two performances really did her justice --- the woman has the most amazing backbends on the face of the planet and, in person at least, is a very lovely lady who seems to be having a great time on stage (here she seems very somber and a tad scary).  And will someone PLEASE get Jillina into something a little less tacky? (I'm sorry, but hot-pink stuffed snakes don't work on redheads.)  Suhaila's first number was okay, but her second looked more like a standing lap dance with a tableside violinist.  The DVD closes with Dondi impersonating Marilyn Monroe.  In the live show, Dondi vamps, flirts, and wiggles to ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"", and it's a hoot.  Here, however, the music has been replaced with a drum solo and the Marilyn impersonation consists of four minutes (give or take) of quivering, gasping, and moaning in which the only thing Marilynesque is the platinum wig.  Weird.So is this worth adding to your collection?  Well, yes --- after all, the dancers really are spectacular and there are some moments that actually catch that.  The cinematography wasn't their fault.  It's an enjoyable video, but it could have been more so.",4,"Great dancing, but fire the cameraman",1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,2950,"['Bellydance', 'Superstars', 'DVD', 'latest', 'project', 'rock-impresario-turned-bellydance-fan', 'Miles', 'Copeland', 'many', 'dancers', 'Bellydance', 'Superstars', 'tour', 'including', 'such', 'luminaries', 'Ansuya', 'Rania', 'Rachel', 'Brice', 'Amar', 'Gamal', 'great', 'idea', 'reality', 'short.I', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'Bellydance', 'Superstars', 'live', 'few', 'days', 'got', 'DVD', 'let', 'tell', 'something', 'women', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'left', 'show', 'stoked', 'ready', 'dance', 'shame', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'really', 'capture', 'incredible', 'energy', 'live', 'performances', 'reason', 'look', 'more', 'music', 'video', 'documentary', 'weird', 'high-angle', 'shots', 'down', 'dancers', 'cleavages', 'several', 'moments', 'when', 'cameraman', 'be', 'peering', 'large', 'candleholder', 'LOTS', 'loving', 'closeups', 'disembodied', 'sequined', 'bosoms', 'undulating', 'bellies', 'shimmying', 'backsides', ""'re"", 'teenage', 'boy', 'great', ""'re"", 'student', 'bellydance', 'looking', 'pointers', 'am', 'not', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'camerawork', 'downright', 'amateurish', 'dancers', 'whirling', 'frame', 'heads', 'being', 'cut', 'off', 'transitions', 'being', 'lost', 'camera', 'jerking', 'around', 'operator', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'looking', 'Most', 'time', 'dancers', 'are', 'visible', 'only', 'mid-thigh', 'wonder', 'what', 'feet', 'are', 'doing', 'traveling', 'steps', 'Personally', 'think', 'video', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'style', 'Bellydance', 'Divas', 'where', 'could', 'see', 'whole', 'dancer', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'doing.That', 'being', 'said', 'fantastic', 'dancing', 'DVD', 'loved', 'Ansuya', 'two', 'numbers', 'as', 'well', 'offerings', 'Amar', 'Sonia', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Rachel', 'two', 'performances', 'really', 'did', 'justice', 'woman', 'most', 'amazing', 'backbends', 'face', 'planet', 'person', 'least', 'very', 'lovely', 'lady', 'who', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'stage', 'here', 'very', 'somber', 'tad', 'scary', 'will', 'someone', 'PLEASE', 'get', 'Jillina', 'something', 'little', 'less', 'tacky', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'hot-pink', 'stuffed', 'snakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'redheads', 'Suhaila', 'first', 'number', 'was', 'okay', 'second', 'looked', 'more', 'standing', 'lap', 'dance', 'tableside', 'violinist', 'DVD', 'Dondi', 'impersonating', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'live', 'show', 'Dondi', 'vamps', 'flirts', 'wiggles', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Loved', 'hoot', 'Here', 'however', 'music', 'been', 'replaced', 'drum', 'solo', 'Marilyn', 'impersonation', 'four', 'minutes', 'give', 'take', 'quivering', 'gasping', 'moaning', 'only', 'thing', 'Marilynesque', 'platinum', 'wig', 'Weird.So', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'Well', 'yes', 'dancers', 'really', 'are', 'spectacular', 'are', 'moments', 'actually', 'catch', 'cinematography', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'enjoyable', 'video', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'so']",N/A

801747,AMTV3L9A3WPSG,B0001DMY3W,"E. L. White ""member of the 3AM Zill Brigade""","[4, 6]","First, let me say that most of the dancing is good. Jillina and Amar Gamal do a wonderful job, and the overall dancing is pretty decent. The costumes for the most part are lovely, although I didn't care for Jillina's pink snake (I liked her other one, it was very pretty and sassy!) and Suhaila's costumes were rather strange looking in my opinion. The set was pretty, although crowded and a bit too smokey. The price was VERY reasonable for a belly dance video. Even a regular movie is more expensive. Some of the camera angles were nice, such as the slightly overhead shot during veil work.However... The camera work over all is extremely annoying. The camera person used constant close-ups and sometimes the dancer danced out of the shot. At a few points, the camera jerked violently when the camera man made an obvious mistake and lost the dancer. The camera work seemed very amateur. The close-ups made the dancing seems vulgar, despite the fact that all these dancers are very classy. The props such as candle holders were sometimes used in the foreground, which covered the dancer up. Several times you had to watch the dancer through shier fabric. Either the camera man was on crack, or they thought the dancing wasn't interesting enough to go without annoying camera tricks. Rachel's skill was not shown to its full potential. Her drum solo was so cut-up by CONSTANT camera changes that it's very hard to follow. It seemed to be the worse chopped up of all the segments. I could tell it was amazing, but I couldn't follow it. Ansuya and Rania's performances didn't show their full potential either. They just weren't on the ball. I think they may have been limited to music from Mile's company, instead of music they were most comfortable with. Ansuya's breasts had constant close-ups. Sonia seemed to repeat the same movements over and over. The camera man was obsessed with her face and tummy. Her dance segments were obviously edited to put moves in places where they were not, so her dance is not fluid. She may be a nice dancer, but I'm pretty sure she doesn't have the ability to be using veil, then make it disappear for a hip shot, then retrieve it again in a split second. This was also done with other dances. Suhaila looked like she was having an epileptic attack. I don't even watch her dance segments. I haven't even watched the violin one all the way through. During one of Ansuya's segments, it was obvious they taped someone using zils over her playing, so you don't get to hear HER play while dancing.Overall, the DVD isn't expensive and the dancing is pretty good. The camera man may be on crack, but the video is OK if you can get past it.Also, my version has both of Tamalyn Dallal's dance segments. Someone said one was missing on their DVD.

I'm sure she's not everyone's cuppa tea, since she has pretty much invented her own style of dance, but I found her mesmerizing to watch. I was holding my breath a lot during her performances, and the video editing bothered me most on her pieces, since I wanted to see every unique movement.Suhaila's performances nearly moved me to tears. So expressive, she truly was the music brought to life.Jillina was also a joy to watch - the pink snake costume might have been a distraction if I hadn't already been told to look past the costume and really see the drum solo. Rania's performances were good, as always, but nothing I hadn't seen already on the Divas DVD.I wasn't in love with every performance, but frankly, with what I usually have to pay for a good quality performance video with only one decent dancer on it....if I'd paid twice as much for this dvd I'd be happy with it.

It's like bad porno camerawork, with extreme closeups of boobs and bellies, often through smoke. Suhaila Salimpour in particular must have been pissed. Her violin taxim is almost completely just closeup shots of her face, the bellydrape on her costume, and even the back of the violinist's head. I have no idea what her dancing was like. I was angry for her.And Jillina.... Oh my. Her dancing is spot-on, in my mind, but it took me a while to notice, because I was busy shrieking at the hideousity of her costumes. A pink plush snake wrapped around her boobs, waist, arm, and leg? What was she thinking? And that skirt/pant thing with the animal print? I kept groaning ""Noooooo!"" while watching the video. She's an attractive woman and a highly skilled dancer, so why is she wearing costumes which detract from both of these things?Rania still brings out the cattiness in me. Although there are certain parts of her dancing which I admire very much (her spins and her abdominal control), I find her dancing generally lacking in grace, and her interpretation of the music just doesn't work for me. On the other hand, her costumes suit her very well, and she has the best facial expressions I've yet seen her make in any dance video.Rachel Brice's clips are frustrating, too. The camera lingers on her face and her hands far too much, when it's obvious that the real action is happening through the torso. Yes, she has a lovely face, but I would much rather watch what she's doing than stare at what's tantamount to a slightly moving portrait.Dondi's Marilyn Monroe impression at the end of the video is grotesque. From what I've heard, it was taken out of context from a larger piece. What we're left with is a gurning giggler faking an orgasm through shimmies. She does a good job of the shimmies and the face-pulling, but as is, the piece is just embarassing.All in all, the video makes me feel a whole lot better about my own dancing. I know I could hold my own against these women. And I sure as hell hope I could do a better job with the camerawork. All I'd have to do is just set the camera down on a tripod and point it at the dancers. The video is about the dancers, not about the camera operator's bag of tricks.",3,Bad camerawork kills good dancing,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,2364,"['enjoyed', 'most', 'dancing', 'Bellydance', 'Superstars', 'camerawork', 'so', 'dreadful', 'away', 'completely', 'dancing', 'bad', 'porno', 'camerawork', 'extreme', 'closeups', 'boobs', 'bellies', 'often', 'smoke', 'Suhaila', 'Salimpour', 'particular', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pissed', 'violin', 'taxim', 'almost', 'completely', 'just', 'closeup', 'shots', 'face', 'bellydrape', 'costume', 'even', 'back', 'violinist', 'head', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'dancing', 'was', 'was', 'angry', 'her.And', 'Jillina', 'Oh', 'dancing', 'spot-on', 'mind', 'took', 'while', 'notice', 'was', 'busy', 'shrieking', 'hideousity', 'costumes', 'pink', 'plush', 'snake', 'wrapped', 'boobs', 'waist', 'arm', 'leg', 'What', 'was', 'thinking', 'skirt/pant', 'thing', 'animal', 'print', 'kept', 'groaning', 'Noooooo', 'watching', 'video', 'attractive', 'woman', 'highly', 'skilled', 'dancer', 'so', 'why', 'wearing', 'costumes', 'detract', 'things', 'Rania', 'still', 'out', 'cattiness', 'are', 'certain', 'parts', 'dancing', 'admire', 'very', 'much', 'spins', 'abdominal', 'control', 'find', 'dancing', 'generally', 'lacking', 'grace', 'interpretation', 'music', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'other', 'hand', 'costumes', 'suit', 'very', 'well', 'best', 'facial', 'expressions', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'make', 'dance', 'video.Rachel', 'Brice', 'clips', 'are', 'frustrating', 'too', 'camera', 'face', 'hands', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'obvious', 'real', 'action', 'happening', 'torso', 'Yes', 'lovely', 'face', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'watch', 'what', 'doing', 'stare', 'what', 'tantamount', 'slightly', 'moving', 'portrait.Dondi', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'impression', 'end', 'video', 'grotesque', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'was', 'taken', 'context', 'larger', 'piece', 'What', ""'re"", 'left', 'gurning', 'giggler', 'faking', 'orgasm', 'shimmies', 'good', 'job', 'shimmies', 'face-pulling', 'piece', 'just', 'embarassing.All', 'video', 'feel', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'own', 'dancing', 'know', 'could', 'hold', 'own', 'women', 'sure', 'hell', 'hope', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'camerawork', ""'d"", 'have', 'do', 'just', 'set', 'camera', 'down', 'tripod', 'point', 'dancers', 'video', 'dancers', 'not', 'camera', 'operator', 'bag', 'tricks']",N/A

If you like to watch women dance, this DVD delivers.  On the downside, I didn't particularily care for Suhaila Salimpour's routines.  In relation to the other dancers, her performances were way too dramatic (read ""artsy"") for my taste.  I much prefer to watch a dancer that looks like she's enjoying herself.  Bellydance scholars may say that I'm full of it and that I don't know what I'm talking about.  Maybe so, but I know what I like.
