How many can relate to this??  Now, as I watched it last night after getting this DVD, I have to really stop and think what a great film this is and what a marvelous comedienne Stockard Channing is.  In this movie she does to her tormenters what we would all like to do to those who hurt us, but don't have the guts to.

It took previous decades efforts to the next level, but not quite to the big screen category. But that doesn't mean this era didn't have its gems. This flick ranks among my faves in that category. Stockard Channing is maybe at her all time sexiest in a role made for her brand of humor, and Ed Asner is perfect for the cop in pursuit of the bent on revenge beauty. The get even scenes leave a little to be desired here for plausibility. But they're still very entertaining scenes and do the job. The twist at the end is a chuckle in itself, when Asner finally meets Channing. That alone is very Channing. You can see Joan Rivers hands in on this project. But throw contemporary expectations out the window and let yourself go for a fun movie that doesn't pretend to be Oscar quality, and in towards that end it's very entertaining. Those who never saw Channing in her youngest years will be surprised at how appealing she was at her oeak. She carries her ugly duckling character with total hilarity, giving her her best beginning to end performance, in my opinion. Give it a whirl.

I remembered it from way back when it must have been on tv and I was just a kid.  The somersault scene and the bathtub scene stayed with me for years. I was so glad to be able to see it again.Although a bit dated, now, it still is remarkable.  Stockard Channing, never known for her absolute beauty, plays the lead role of a young woman who is consistently treated terribly and hurt constantly.  But, through a series of events, she turns from unattractive and unwanted to beautiful and desired.  With this, however, comes a transformation of character.  Confidence is good, yes, but revenge? Probably not.Despite the fact that Channing isn't doing ""good"", so to speak, Channing really plays this role well.  While she takes revenge on everyone who has hurt her, you still are cheering for her.  Ed Asner is on to her, though, as the tough-but-sympathetic detective.Yes, although this has many comedic elements, I wouldn't just say it was a black comedy.

Airhart ""smartThingie""","[2, 3]","At one hour and fourteen minutes in length, The Girl Most Likely To is better than the average 1970s movie of the week, yet shallower in character development, faster in pace and brighter in outlook than what we expect today in dark comedies.In this fantasy, Miriam is an intelligent and sensitive ugly duckling (a stock character) who becomes a swan and dispatches poetic justice against the other stock characters that had tormented her. The suspense is not in wondering who will survive, but in guessing how Miriam will trick her old enemies into doing themselves in.It isn't possible in 74 minutes for a movie to provide much supporting detail. Miriam's actions are described as ""perfect crimes"" by an admiring police investigator, yet any modern detective-story fan would know how to identify the culprit before she became a serial killer. The investigator's growing attraction to Miriam is not well explained, and the movie's ending seems to be a parody of the preceding 73 minutes -- as if to say, ""The joke's on you, TV viewer.""Nevertheless, Stockard Channing is convincing as an ambitious, vulnerable and finally dispirited ugly duckling -- and as a stunningly stylish and sadistic swan.

For any movie to have been so profoundly memorable to so many people... you know it has to be great.Stockard Channing's performance and makeup in this movie were exceptional. One of a kind... which is why this movie has really stuck in our minds.The portrayal of her as a very homely, overweight girl who is cruelly tormented and abused by her classmates is so realistic, it is hard to believe it is makeup. They didn't have the fancy tricks available back then... nor the budgets. So, when Stockard Channing transforms into her new appearance, it is quite a shock. It is hard to believe it is the same actress.Then when she seeks revenge, she becomes the most amazing chameleon of multiple disguises and accents. A truly memorable display of Stockard Channing's acting talents.In addition to Ed Asner, you will see many other recognizable actors in this movie who were very young at the time. Well known in top rated series like Chips, Love Boat, Gilligan's Island, etc.After seeing this movie, it was apparent that she should have been a top talent in film and TV. She apparently opted to do a lot of stage performances but that deprived the rest of us from seeing her. I was disappointed over the years that I didn't see a lot more of her in movies. I think her manager didn't do her justice. She should have had a better choice of scripts and films. Definitely an under appreciated talent with multifaceted skills.While I'm not a Joan Rivers fan, her writing of this story was exceptional. She and the director should be commended for this masterpiece. They did a top notch job without expending a huge budget. This was back before movies had to depend on computer graphics and special effects to keep the audience entertained. There was not a boring moment in the entire movie. The only problem which might have reduced the audience is that it shares a similar title with a much older movie and could have easily been mistaken for that other movie when listed.I do have an old VHS copy of this movie which I fortunately made back around 1985 but is not the best quality since it was taped from antenna. It was probably the only time I can remember that this movie was ever repeated and I was just lucky enough to catch it at that time.So I am thrilled to finally find this movie again.

Ryan ""mstee-arrrr""","[3, 3]","I first saw this movie years ago as a teenager - I loved the idea of the 'ugly' duckling (with brains) metamorphosing into a beautiful (if not deadly) swan - all those extra curricular classes she took paid off (poisons, chemistry, acting and make-up)- and how!!! I think this was one of the last roles that Joe Flynn played before he died in a tragic pool accident - as a bumbling, inept surgeon whose primary function was the issuing of death certificates for his patients!!  The manner in which Stockard dispatched her enemies was as artful and as witty as the persona beneath the plain initial exterior - the way she disposed of the people who caused her such emotional and phyiscal pain and was ingenious - drowning of her former fiance in the bathroom of their motel room, the bubble headed cheerleader who backflipped her way out of the dorm's upper floor's window, the medical intern who succumbed to fate by appendectomy amongst other equally gruesome (but very ingenious) methods for her tormentors, with Ed Asner as her law-enforcement nemisis who not only captured her but also her heart.  I felt this was a movie for the underdog - a light at the end of the dark tunnel - that every (under)dog will have their day - although I'm not one to recommend murder as the way to deal with torment - it was nice to see that bullies dont always win in the end - and I'm glad to see that it finally made it to DVD!!!!",4,the girl most likely to ......get back,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,1419,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'teenager', 'loved', 'idea', ""'ugly"", 'duckling', 'brains', 'metamorphosing', 'beautiful', 'not', 'deadly', 'swan', 'extra', 'curricular', 'classes', 'took', 'paid', 'off', 'poisons', 'chemistry', 'acting', 'make-up', 'how', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'roles', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'played', 'died', 'tragic', 'pool', 'accident', 'bumbling', 'inept', 'surgeon', 'primary', 'function', 'was', 'issuing', 'death', 'certificates', 'patients', 'manner', 'Stockard', 'dispatched', 'enemies', 'was', 'artful', 'as', 'witty', 'persona', 'plain', 'initial', 'exterior', 'way', 'disposed', 'people', 'who', 'caused', 'such', 'emotional', 'phyiscal', 'pain', 'was', 'ingenious', 'drowning', 'former', 'fiance', 'bathroom', 'motel', 'room', 'bubble', 'headed', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'backflipped', 'way', 'dorm', 'upper', 'floor', 'window', 'medical', 'intern', 'who', 'succumbed', 'fate', 'appendectomy', 'amongst', 'other', 'equally', 'gruesome', 'very', 'ingenious', 'methods', 'tormentors', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'law-enforcement', 'nemisis', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'captured', 'also', 'heart', 'felt', 'was', 'movie', 'underdog', 'light', 'end', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'dog', 'will', 'have', 'day', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'recommend', 'murder', 'way', 'deal', 'torment', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'bullies', 'dont', 'always', 'win', 'end', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'finally', 'made', 'DVD']",N/A

927744,A2UVJD6OOLKEBR,B000ALM4EE,yaremar,"[8, 9]","I had no idea that this made-for-TV film was scheduled for release on DVD (it never made it to video), so when I saw it on the shelf at Best Buy, I was thunderstruck. Forget WAR OF THE WORLDS or THE MAKING OF PETER JACKSON'S KING KONG--as far as I'm concerned, this is the big holiday release for 2005.I first saw THE GIRL MOST LIKELY TO... back in 1973 when it aired as part of ABC-TV's ""Movie of the Week"" series. Most entries in this series were highly forgettable outings, but there were notable exceptions, among them: THE NIGHT STALKER; THE NIGHT STRANGLER; DR. COOK'S GARDEN; A COLD NIGHT'S DEATH;  RUN, SIMON, RUN; TRIBES; MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING; and this wicked black comedy that introduced me to the wonderful Stockard Channing, who is still one of the best comedic actresses in the business. (She's also terrific in dramatic roles.) Stockard plays Miriam Knight, an ""ugly duckling"" college student whom nearly everyone humiliates and deceives. After an auto accident, Miriam undergoes plastic surgery, which transforms her into a shapely beauty. Since her tormentors no longer recognize her, Miriam adopts a variety of phony identities to exact her revenge on each and every one of them.Written by Joan Rivers, THE GIRL MOST LIKELY TO... is a sharp, biting satire, and one of the best comedies of its era. (In fact, it puts most modern comedies to shame, too.) Zipping along at a brisk 74 minutes (it was made to fill a 90-minute time slot), there are no wasted moments. Miss Channing is a marvel to watch as the underdog-turned-cobra, deftly balancing comedy and pathos, and she's ably supported by a strong cast of comic players (Edward Asner, Warren Berlinger, Suzanne Zenor, Jim Backus, Joe Flynn, Fred Grandy, Chuck McCann).If you're already familiar with this dark comedy, you know the five-star rating is well deserved. If you've never seen it, you're in for a real treat. Now that it is finally available on DVD, the holidays will definitely be happier.SPOILER ALERT: DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW THE FILM ENDS.If you've seen this film, you already know that Miriam hunts down all her tormentors and kills them off one by one, then winds up getting arrested by a police inspector (Edward Asner), whom she marries after she's sentenced to prison. In Joan Rivers' original script, however, Miriam gets away with the crimes scott-free, having committed the perfect murders. But the network felt that this was pushing the envelope a bit too much, and the ending was revised (by Agnes Gallin?). Even in its compromised state, THE GIRL MOST LIKELY TO... is a comedy treasure.",5,Good GIRL!,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,2624,"['had', 'idea', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'was', 'scheduled', 'release', 'DVD', 'never', 'made', 'video', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'shelf', 'Best', 'Buy', 'was', 'thunderstruck', 'Forget', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'THE', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'PETER', 'JACKSON', 'KING', 'KONG', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'big', 'holiday', 'release', '2005.I', 'first', 'saw', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'MOST', 'LIKELY', 'TO', 'back', '1973', 'when', 'aired', 'part', 'ABC-TV', 'Movie', 'Week', 'series', 'Most', 'entries', 'series', 'were', 'highly', 'forgettable', 'outings', 'were', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'NIGHT', 'STALKER', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'STRANGLER', 'DR.', 'COOK', 'GARDEN', 'A', 'COLD', 'NIGHT', 'DEATH', 'RUN', 'SIMON', 'RUN', 'TRIBES', 'MAYBE', ""'LL"", 'COME', 'HOME', 'IN', 'THE', 'SPRING', 'wicked', 'black', 'comedy', 'introduced', 'wonderful', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'who', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'comedic', 'actresses', 'business', 'also', 'terrific', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'Stockard', 'Miriam', 'Knight', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'college', 'student', 'whom', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'humiliates', 'deceives', 'auto', 'accident', 'Miriam', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'shapely', 'beauty', 'tormentors', 'no', 'longer', 'recognize', 'Miriam', 'variety', 'phony', 'identities', 'exact', 'revenge', 'one', 'them.Written', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'MOST', 'LIKELY', 'TO', 'sharp', 'biting', 'satire', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'era', 'fact', 'most', 'modern', 'comedies', 'shame', 'too', 'Zipping', 'along', 'brisk', '74', 'minutes', 'was', 'made', 'fill', '90-minute', 'time', 'slot', 'are', 'wasted', 'moments', 'Miss', 'Channing', 'marvel', 'watch', 'underdog-turned-cobra', 'deftly', 'balancing', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'ably', 'supported', 'strong', 'cast', 'comic', 'players', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'Warren', 'Berlinger', 'Suzanne', 'Zenor', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'Fred', 'Grandy', 'Chuck', 'McCann', '.If', ""'re"", 'already', 'familiar', 'dark', 'comedy', 'know', 'five-star', 'rating', 'well', 'deserved', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', ""'re"", 'real', 'treat', 'Now', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'holidays', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'happier.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'READ', 'ANY', 'FURTHER', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WANT', 'TO', 'KNOW', 'HOW', 'THE', 'FILM', 'ENDS.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'already', 'know', 'Miriam', 'hunts', 'down', 'tormentors', 'kills', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'then', 'up', 'getting', 'arrested', 'police', 'inspector', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'whom', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'original', 'script', 'however', 'Miriam', 'away', 'crimes', 'scott-free', 'having', 'committed', 'perfect', 'murders', 'network', 'felt', 'was', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'was', 'revised', 'Agnes', 'Gallin', 'Even', 'compromised', 'state', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'MOST', 'LIKELY', 'TO', 'comedy', 'treasure']",N/A
