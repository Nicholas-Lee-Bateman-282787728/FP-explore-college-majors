When I saw this film I thought of my cousin, who struggled with PTSD and was confined to Oakland Naval Hospital in the mental ward.  He moved through this stage and actually came back to teach high school in a small Utah town.  He had two daughters and a loving wife, still - one day he hung himself in his basement.

First, we see him as a little child, playing with his buddies with weapons (toys, of course). Then we see him as a teenager, whose main concern is to finish school, go to the prom and dance with his love interest, a girl named Donna. At this point the movie seems like a TV series episode, but the story changes radically once the young Ron hears the speech of a recruiting Sergeant.Now the only thing that Ron can think about is to go to the Vietnam War and fight for his country. So he goes to Vietnam, and in the process he is witness of horror, death, tragedy and injustice. He also gets badly injured and becomes paralyzed from the chest down.He returns home and finds that the new generation is very different in ideas, they hate the war and criticize the USA government. Initially he defends ""Uncle Sam"" ideas and repudiates the lack of ""patriotism"" of the young hippie generation. But gradually he discovers that the war is absurd and ridiculous, and he fells used and frustrated.""Born On The Fourth Of July"" shows how the young people was wasted in the Vietnam war; some of they lost their lives, some of them were mutilated, but all of them were damaged both physically and mentally.Once again, Oliver Stone repudiates the Vietnam war in this movie, and in the process, he makes a criticism to some establishments of the American way of life, the USA government, the paranoia about the communism, the ""Uncle Sam Wants you"" mentality, and above all, the use of young people to fulfill political ambitions.The only part that I personally hated were the scenes in Mexico; those scenes were boring, pointless and were made with incredible bad taste, but in general the movie is well made and provokes different emotions and thoughts.",4,4 STARS TO THIS GOOD AND CONTROVERSIAL MOVIE.,1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,1849,"['Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'follow', 'life', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'divided', 'episodes', 'First', 'see', 'little', 'child', 'playing', 'buddies', 'weapons', 'toys', 'course', 'Then', 'see', 'teenager', 'main', 'concern', 'finish', 'school', 'go', 'prom', 'dance', 'love', 'interest', 'girl', 'named', 'Donna', 'point', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'episode', 'story', 'changes', 'radically', 'young', 'Ron', 'speech', 'recruiting', 'Sergeant.Now', 'only', 'thing', 'Ron', 'can', 'think', 'about', 'go', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'fight', 'country', 'Vietnam', 'process', 'witness', 'horror', 'death', 'tragedy', 'injustice', 'also', 'badly', 'injured', 'becomes', 'paralyzed', 'chest', 'down.He', 'returns', 'home', 'new', 'generation', 'very', 'different', 'ideas', 'hate', 'war', 'criticize', 'USA', 'government', 'Initially', 'Uncle', 'Sam', 'ideas', 'lack', 'patriotism', 'young', 'hippie', 'generation', 'gradually', 'war', 'absurd', 'ridiculous', 'used', 'frustrated', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'how', 'young', 'people', 'was', 'wasted', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'lost', 'lives', 'were', 'mutilated', 'were', 'damaged', 'physically', 'mentally.Once', 'again', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'movie', 'process', 'criticism', 'establishments', 'American', 'way', 'life', 'USA', 'government', 'paranoia', 'communism', 'Uncle', 'Sam', 'Wants', 'mentality', 'use', 'young', 'people', 'fulfill', 'political', 'ambitions.The', 'only', 'part', 'personally', 'hated', 'were', 'scenes', 'Mexico', 'scenes', 'were', 'boring', 'pointless', 'were', 'made', 'incredible', 'bad', 'taste', 'general', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'provokes', 'different', 'emotions', 'thoughts']",N/A

The most powerful nation on earth, having free speech and a free press, duped into a totally unnecesary and even counterproductive war?  A Congress fooled by a dissembling and deceitful administration, with few dissenters.Well, it happened again in 2003, and watching this movie, one of my favorites, is even more heartbreaking now  than it was when I first saw it years ago.  It's a period piece starting in the '50s, beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly capturing the spirit of three decades that I know well from personal experience.  It's the story of Ron Kovic, who volunteered for duty in Vietnam, was severely wounded, and returned to find that not only had the war been unnecessary, but he and his fellow veterans were not all that welcome, especially when they started exercising their rights to protest the continuation of the war.This is Stone's best movie by far.  The joys of family life, the horrors of war, the pain of catastrophic injury, the trauma of alienation, the exhilaration of redemption... all are depicted movingly and accurately.  In this movie, Stone is uncharacteristically as understated as John Williams' wonderful score.  There are scenes, such as when Cruise's character, based on a real story, returns to his old neighborhood on Long Island to find his parents,family, and neighbors uneasily prepared for him, that always bring tears to my eyes.  But that is just one of many such scenes.Stone also is dead-on in his depiction of the attitude of the American public toward returning Vietnam veterans and the veterans' despair and bitterness.  Alas, I fear that we have not seen yet the development of those same feelings as we have yet to see very many returning Iraq War veterans in this war, which never made any sense, but we will.It's amazing to watch this movie again now and to see all the parallels with Vietnam, beginning with the killing of innocent civilians, confusion in the fighting, deaths of minority and working class kids, etc.Like I said, it is heartbreaking to see this happen again, but this movie ought to be re-released or be shown in schools. Of course, being realistic, it has so much profanity and explicit references to sex that it will never be seen by those who ought to see it--impressionable kids who are brainwashed by government propaganda.A side note:  George W. Bush was probably at the 1972 GOP Convention that is depicted in the last part of this movie, so he was probably there when Ron Kovic and other Vietnam Veterans against the War were spit upon and gassed by police.  Why John Kerry and his campaign did not bother to mention this--and a number of other things having to do with unnecessary wars--in the 2004 campaign is beyond me.This is a movie to watch with your teenage son or daughter and to discuss afterward.",5,Stone's best; Cruise's best and never more timely than now,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,2903,"['How', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'Thousands', 'innocent', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'killed', 'nothing', 'most', 'powerful', 'nation', 'earth', 'having', 'free', 'speech', 'free', 'press', 'duped', 'totally', 'unnecesary', 'even', 'counterproductive', 'war', 'Congress', 'fooled', 'dissembling', 'deceitful', 'administration', 'few', 'dissenters.Well', 'happened', 'again', '2003', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'favorites', 'even', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'now', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'period', 'piece', 'starting', ""'50s"", 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'perfectly', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'three', 'decades', 'know', 'well', 'personal', 'experience', 'story', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'who', 'volunteered', 'duty', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'severely', 'wounded', 'returned', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'war', 'been', 'unnecessary', 'fellow', 'veterans', 'were', 'not', 'welcome', 'especially', 'when', 'started', 'exercising', 'rights', 'protest', 'continuation', 'war.This', 'Stone', 'best', 'movie', 'far', 'joys', 'family', 'life', 'horrors', 'war', 'pain', 'catastrophic', 'injury', 'trauma', 'alienation', 'exhilaration', 'redemption', 'are', 'depicted', 'movingly', 'accurately', 'movie', 'Stone', 'uncharacteristically', 'as', 'understated', 'John', 'Williams', 'wonderful', 'score', 'are', 'scenes', 'such', 'when', 'Cruise', 'character', 'based', 'real', 'story', 'returns', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'Long', 'Island', 'find', 'parents', 'family', 'neighbors', 'uneasily', 'prepared', 'always', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'such', 'scenes.Stone', 'also', 'dead-on', 'depiction', 'attitude', 'American', 'public', 'returning', 'Vietnam', 'veterans', 'veterans', 'despair', 'bitterness', 'Alas', 'fear', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'development', 'same', 'feelings', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'very', 'many', 'returning', 'Iraq', 'War', 'veterans', 'war', 'never', 'made', 'sense', 'will.It', 'amazing', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'now', 'see', 'parallels', 'Vietnam', 'beginning', 'killing', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'confusion', 'fighting', 'deaths', 'minority', 'working', 'class', 'kids', 'etc.Like', 'said', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'happen', 'again', 'movie', 'ought', 'be', 're-released', 'be', 'shown', 'schools', 'course', 'being', 'realistic', 'so', 'much', 'profanity', 'explicit', 'references', 'sex', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'who', 'ought', 'see', 'impressionable', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'brainwashed', 'government', 'propaganda.A', 'side', 'note', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'was', 'probably', '1972', 'GOP', 'Convention', 'depicted', 'last', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'there', 'when', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'other', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'War', 'were', 'spit', 'gassed', 'police', 'Why', 'John', 'Kerry', 'campaign', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'mention', 'number', 'other', 'things', 'having', 'do', 'unnecessary', 'wars', '2004', 'campaign', 'me.This', 'movie', 'watch', 'teenage', 'son', 'daughter', 'discuss', 'afterward']",N/A

Many Americans went deep into this deliberation when veterans like Ron Kovic went on record questioning the wisdom behind US's offensive against Vietnam. Regardless of historical outcome of the war, the question will haunt USA forever -was the Vietnam War a noble and just cause. Your answer could be anything depending upon your political and ideological preferences, but the reality of thousands who lost their lives and limbs continues to hurt.Oliver Stone's Born on Fourth of July - based on the true story of Ron Kovic - takes the audience through the triumph and trauma of a crusader who went from one side of the war debate to the other. Ron wanted to fight for his country and stop the evil force of communism dead in its tracks. He went to Vietnam to defend his nation but came back soon, injured and doomed to suffer further. In the inadequately equipped hospital, his dreamer instincts crashed against the harsh realities of political ambivalence, not for the first time though.Over next eight years that are depicted in this masterpiece, the character of Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise with unprecedented brilliance) goes through the trauma of knowing that no one will ""love him now"", that even his own sibling is not on the same side of ideology, that the government had more pressing issues than taking good care of war veterans, that his countrymen did not necessarily endorse of his view point. The reality that he killed a soldier from his own army, the reality that he was the unfortunate one to butcher children and women in Vietnam, the reality that he would not be able to father a child, the reality of his realization that his government had made a wrong case for the war - it all kept gnawing at his conscience. It kept gnawing him until he opened up to speak about what was wrong about this war. Thus `ended' the patriotic fervor of a driven person, but he continued his passion as an antiwar activist.Born on Fourth of July may have been the story of one Ron Kovic, but there are many others whose sentiments would echo with this veteran's. At the end, there is no easy way out of this debate. War always comes with its baggage of pain, trauma and hurt. Whether Vietnam was a mistake or not - the arguments would go on forever. So would the history of people who aspired to be motivated by JFK's historical urge - Ask not what your country can do for you, See what you can do for your country - only to realize that in every war there is only one casualty - the human spirit. The pangs of this reality hurt, just does as their own reality.",4,Reality hurts,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,2730,"['When', 'see', 'war', 'veteran', 'campaigning', 'very', 'war', 'was', 'willing', 'die', 'once', 'begin', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'intent', 'war', 'Many', 'Americans', 'went', 'deep', 'deliberation', 'when', 'veterans', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'went', 'record', 'questioning', 'wisdom', 'US', 'offensive', 'Vietnam', 'Regardless', 'historical', 'outcome', 'war', 'question', 'will', 'haunt', 'USA', 'forever', '-was', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'noble', 'just', 'cause', 'answer', 'could', 'be', 'anything', 'depending', 'political', 'ideological', 'preferences', 'reality', 'thousands', 'who', 'lost', 'lives', 'limbs', 'hurt.Oliver', 'Stone', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'audience', 'triumph', 'trauma', 'crusader', 'who', 'went', 'one', 'side', 'war', 'debate', 'other', 'Ron', 'wanted', 'fight', 'country', 'stop', 'evil', 'force', 'communism', 'dead', 'tracks', 'went', 'Vietnam', 'defend', 'nation', 'came', 'back', 'soon', 'injured', 'doomed', 'suffer', 'further', 'inadequately', 'equipped', 'hospital', 'dreamer', 'instincts', 'crashed', 'harsh', 'realities', 'political', 'ambivalence', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'though.Over', 'next', 'eight', 'years', 'are', 'depicted', 'masterpiece', 'character', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'unprecedented', 'brilliance', 'trauma', 'knowing', 'one', 'will', 'love', 'now', 'even', 'own', 'sibling', 'not', 'same', 'side', 'ideology', 'government', 'had', 'more', 'pressing', 'issues', 'taking', 'good', 'care', 'war', 'veterans', 'countrymen', 'did', 'not', 'necessarily', 'endorse', 'view', 'point', 'reality', 'killed', 'soldier', 'own', 'army', 'reality', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'one', 'butcher', 'children', 'women', 'Vietnam', 'reality', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'father', 'child', 'reality', 'realization', 'government', 'had', 'made', 'wrong', 'case', 'war', 'kept', 'gnawing', 'conscience', 'kept', 'gnawing', 'opened', 'up', 'speak', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'war', 'Thus', 'ended', 'patriotic', 'fervor', 'driven', 'person', 'continued', 'passion', 'antiwar', 'activist.Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'one', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'sentiments', 'would', 'echo', 'veteran', 'end', 'easy', 'way', 'debate', 'War', 'always', 'baggage', 'pain', 'trauma', 'hurt', 'Whether', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'mistake', 'not', 'arguments', 'would', 'go', 'forever', 'So', 'would', 'history', 'people', 'who', 'aspired', 'be', 'motivated', 'JFK', 'historical', 'urge', 'Ask', 'not', 'what', 'country', 'can', 'do', 'See', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'country', 'only', 'realize', 'war', 'only', 'one', 'casualty', 'human', 'spirit', 'pangs', 'reality', 'hurt', 'just', 'own', 'reality']",N/A

It is he who gives the performance of his lifetime. The story of Ron Kovic is a sad, moving tragic story that touched my heart. The spectacular job in direction by Oliver Stone is not to be missed and shows why he is one of the best in business. Immersing history of 70's into his films makes him a great contributor. Looking back at many films by Tom Cruise, I can easily tell that this is the finest work that Tom Cruise had done because he pours in his heart for his character. Of course, the hair on him is very interesting, making a nice touch to realism. It makes me to wonder how does that happen in real life. Willem Dafoe and Caroline Kava turn in marvelous supporting performances. Her role as the mother brings one illusion of a perspective while Ron Kovic brings the out the truth, coming from the other side. The clash of two ideals makes for a compelling battle of beliefs. It's not a question of what's right or wrong but more of a showing how differently they perceive the world. What a job by Tom Berenger when he gives the speech about the Marine Corps. Again, Born on the Fourth of July is a brilliant film by Oliver Stone, and it's Tom Cruise who is to be awed at.2/13: Born on the Fourth of July is one of the best works that Tom Cruise has ever did in his career. His performance is top notch. It's probably Oliver Stone's credit for making it happen because how he directed the picture is seamless and moving. It is almost as if he manipulated the atmospheric elements to tell a story of a disabled Vietnam veteran, going from a idealistic perspective to a cynical, jaded perspective. Tom Cruise captures that very well through his eyes. I love the cameo from Tom Berenger who gives this gung-ho Marines speech for recruiting purpose and still can't forget that he is still Barnes. Speaking of Platoon, how about that effective supporting performance from Willem Dafoe? Although many proclaim Born on the Fourth of July to be Oliver Stone's best film, I disagree and say it is Wall Street.

His heart-rending portrayal of  the fate of a naive young man out to imitate the heroic exploits of screen  icons John Wayne and Audie Murphy is a modern classic, a cautionary tale of  the horrible consequences of blindly trusting the government to do what is  is right by this young man and hundreds of thousands just like him. Kovics  enlists in the Marines and volunteers for duty in Vietnam, thereby  fatefully and tragically changing the arc of his young life as a result.  While this true story based on the best-selling autobiography of disabled  Vietnam vet Ron Kovics is first and foremost Kovics' personal story, it is  also very much the story of the Vietnam war's aftermath, of its bounty  brought home, and the movie quite accurately depicts its searing impacts on  the lives of all the survivors of the war itself (whether direct  participants or not) and the fractious, violent and sometimes bloody clash  between the traditional true believers on the one hand and a whole range of  thoughtful dissenters on the other against continuation of the war. Tom  Cruise is superb here, and the uncensored truth of the times and trials and  wracking search for a new sort of meaningful balance in his new life of  permanent disability if a deep dark look at the realities of what the war  did to millions of young men who wanted nothing more than to honorably  serve their country.

56363,AH1KJ45IQTM4T,0783226764,Benjamin,"[6, 11]","This is a great movie I rate 4 stars and a half or 9/10.It is included in the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers, and won 2 Oscars: Best Director, and Best Film Editing. Oliver Stone goes beyond his first movie about Vietnam telling the story of Ron Kovic, who wrote his own experience in Vietnam in a book that I highly recommend.Kovic served twice in Vietnam (I wished nobody had gone...) and was paralized after being shot twice. Coming back to the US, he is treated worse than a pig in a farm in a hospital for Viet vets. At the beginning, he is a strong supporter of the cause of war (I don't recall this being told in the book), and uses the ""Love It or Leave It"" BS that I've heard some other place (I mean, is there anything more American than speak freely? Isn't that Democracy?) Soon, though, he realizes how that war is a big lie, and starts joining demonstrations against the war.As in Platoon, we see waht war does with men. You are not a human being anymore. There are some very tough scenes that would make anybody cry. The toughest in my opinion is the one at the village, when they kill innocent women and children. Then, Kovic shoots, by mistake, an American soldier, blinded by the sun, and, also, by the brutality and ferocity or war.Cruise is absolutely gorgeous in this movie, and Oliver Stone won an Oscar for best director. In my opinion, this movie is better than Platoon, because we get to see the life of a soldier before he becomes a soldier. Then we see him fighting, and afterwards, when he is a Vet. So we have the whole picture, and that makes more sense to me than Platoon (even though Platoon is an excellent movie). Tom Berenger and Dafoe have both short appearences here. And that is nice!This movie should be mandatory in all High Schools in America. If there were no soldiers, there would be no wars, and the war in Iraq looks a lot like the war in Vietnam. USA is making the same mistake again, and the government is so blind to see that (or maybe they don't care about the people, just about the business all the weapons' companies -Bush' frieds- are making out of it!). But let's be smart, let's just ignore the government. They always get their way. Let's be smart and close all ROTC programs from schools. How can we be so hypocrites and have those programs in schools? Is that the education we really think our children deserve? That does not happen any other place in the world, not even in Cuba. Let's invest that money on education. REAL education. How many trilion dollars have Bush wasted in Iraq so far? How much money does the government invest on education? On health? For the people who live and work in America? Parents: teach your children. Nobody should join the Army. Let the politicians -real leaders, not the bunch of idiots we have today spread all over the planet- do the job, we'll see how many would go. Let the Commander in Chief go to war himself. There is no question about it: there would be no war. They wouldn't go. They would try to negotiate, and try to solve conflicts peacefully.Again, this is a GREAT movie everybody should watch. A masterpiece that is just not that, but also makes us think, and educates us. Everybody should ask themselves: war ... is it worth it?

56369,APP5MBH2BSX6I,0783226764,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[72, 74]","I didn't want to like this movie.  I'm usually resistant to any film whose director grinds an ax so relentlessly as Oliver Stone has been known to, and never so obviously as with this film.  But I recently ran across the NY Times list of 1000 best films, and ""Born On the Fourth of July"" is listed there.  While  any such list is naturally debatable, it caused me to want to see more of those on the list that I hadn't seen, and a satellite channel was running this film at a convenient time.  I must say, the excellence of Stone's craftsmanship, and of Tom Cruise's performance, wore down my resistance to his message, although it took almost half of this lengthy biopic to get past my defenses.What we have here is the true story of a man whose birthday coincides with that of his country, a young man who was properly raised to love all things American.  His patriotism led him to volunteer for the Marine Corps and the Vietnam war in the late 1960s, where everything he had ever believed was challenged in the strongest possible terms.  The watershed events that finally moved him from traditional all-out American patriot to an American who loves his country but distrusts the government and opposes war, however, were events that mostly followed that famously horrifying war, and said events were often as horrifying in their own way as the things he experienced in Vietnam.This truly is an excellent film, no doubt about it.  Stone, a Vietnam vet himself, frames his story expertly, brings out superb performances from all of his players, and included Mr. Kovic (on whose autobiographical book this film is based) at every stage of the production.  The pacing of the tale is smooth and understandable for its nearly 2-1/2 hour length, and the viewer never has a serious problem wondering where Cruise's character is coming from emotionally or intellectually.""Born On the Fourth of July"" has proven to be the capstone of Oliver Stone's career, and was the performance that took Tom Cruise from teen idol to respected actor.  No wonder, as Cruise at times does more in this film with a look than he had been able to accomplish with pages of dialogue earlier in his career.As with almost any 'Nam film, the gore of battle and over-the-top filthy language of its scarred survivors mean that viewing it is more of a cathartic experience than a pleasant one, but beyond that my only nitpick is that one scene has some vets listening to Don McLean's ""American Pie"" in 1968, three years before the song was recorded.  With that minor caveat, the film has given me a lot to think about.  While I don't agree with Stone's politics, there is no question that he, Kovic, and others have arrived at their perspective honestly and forcefully, and this film serves as a fine record of a time in our country's history when we fought a second civil war of sorts.

This is hands down Stone's second best film after 'JFK'.I love this movie because it works on every level there is. Photography, editing, story, acting, score, everything is top of the line. In the opening we are blown away by Ron Kovic's childhood. Why? Because of the stunning photography and editing. Stone gives us an idea of America so perfect you feel like getting up and singing along.Next Ron is thrown into Veitnam, the exact oposite. It's pure hell. Ron's unit kills women and children and even one of there own men. The contrast in settings is amazing.The verteran's hospital the probably the most discusting we see how badly our men need help but instead they are subjected to the most inhumain conditions you can't believe it happened in America. ""I just want to be treated like a human being! Is that so much to ask?"" yells Ron.Once home we see how Ron tries hard to fit back into America but his body is destroyed and he comes to the harsh realization that his life is ruined forever.We switch scenes again to Mexico where Ron induldges in as many vices as he can to show just how low he's sunk.Ron ends up getting his act together and confessing to the family of the fellow Marine he killed, and becomes an anti war activist.I'm probably the only guy writing a positive review of this film that agrees with the Veitnam war 100% but I love movies and 'Born' stands by itself as a stunning drama and cinamatic masterpeice. How they did the photography for this I'll never know. It was way ahead of its time. An anti war movie in the decade that gave us 'Red Dawn'?

56377,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0783226764,Dennis Littrell,"[49, 52]","I avoided this when it came out in 1989 having seen Coming Home (1978) and not wanting to revisit the theme of paraplegic sexual dysfunction and frustration.  I also didn't want to reprise the bloody horror of our involvement in the war in Vietnam that I knew Oliver Stone was going to serve up.  And Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic?  I just didn't think it would work.Well, my preconceptions were wrong.First of all, for those who think that Tom Cruise is just another pretty boy (which was basically my opinion), this movie sets that mistaken notion to rest.  He is nothing short of brilliant in a role that is enormously demanding--physically, mentally, artistically, and emotionally.  I don't see how anybody could play that role and still be the same person.  Someday in his memoirs, Tom Cruise is going to talk about being Ron Kovic as directed by Oliver Stone.And second, Stone's treatment of the sex life of Viet Vets in wheelchairs is absolutely without sentimentality or silver lining.  There are no rose petals and no soft pedaling.  There was no Jane Fonda, as in Coming Home, to play an angel of love.  Instead the high school girl friend understandably went her own way, and love became something you bought if you could afford it.And third, Stone's depiction of America--and this movie really is about America, from the 1950s to the 1970s--from the pseudo-innocence of childhood war games and 4th of July parades down Main street USA to having your guts spilled in a foreign land and your brothers-in-arms being sent home in body bags--was as indelible as black ink on white parchment.  He takes us from proud moms and patriotic homilies to the shameful neglect in our Veteran's hospitals to the bloody clashes between anti-war demonstrators and the police outside convention halls where reveling conventioneers wave flags and mouth phony slogans.I have seen most of Stone's work and as far as fidelity to authentic detail and sustained concentration, this is his best.  There are a thousand details that Stone got exactly right, from Dalton Trumbo's paperback novel of a paraplegic from WW I, Johnny Got His Gun, that sat on a tray near Kovic's hospital bed, to the black medic telling him that there was a more important war going on at the same time as the Vietnam war, namely the civil rights movement, to a mother throwing her son out of the house when he no longer fulfilled her trophy case vision of what her son ought to be, to Willem DaFoe's remark about what you have to do sexually when nothing in the middle moves.Also striking were some of the scenes.  In particular, the confession scene at the home of the boy Kovic accidentally shot; the Mexican brothel scene of sex/love desperation, the drunken scene at the pool hall bar and the pretty girl's face he touches, and then the drunken, hate-filled rage against his mother, and of course the savage hospital scenes--these and some others were deeply moving and likely to haunt me for many years to come.Of course, as usual, Oliver Stone's political message weighed heavily upon his artistic purpose.  Straight-laced conservatives will find his portrait of America one-sided and offensive and something they'd rather forget.  But I imagine that the guys who fought in Vietnam and managed to get back somehow and see this movie, will find it redemptive.  Certainly to watch Ron Kovic, just an ordinary Joe who believed in his country and the sentiments of John Wayne movies and comic book heroics, go from a depressed, enraged, drug-addled waste of a human being to an enlightened, focused, articulate, and ultimately triumphant spokesman for the anti-war movement, for veterans, and the disabled was wonderful to see.  As Stone reminds us, Kovic really did become the hero that his misguided mother dreamed he would be.No other Vietnam war movie haunts me like this one.  There is something about coming back less than whole that is worse than not coming back at all that eats away at our consciousness.  And yet in the end there is here displayed the triumph of the human will and a story about how a man might find redemption in the most deplorable of circumstances.",5,"Haunting and distrubing, but ultimately redemptive",1066867200,"10 23, 2003",2003,4138,"['avoided', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1989', 'having', 'seen', 'Coming', 'Home', '1978', 'not', 'wanting', 'revisit', 'theme', 'paraplegic', 'sexual', 'dysfunction', 'frustration', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'reprise', 'bloody', 'horror', 'involvement', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'knew', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'was', 'going', 'serve', 'up', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'work.Well', 'preconceptions', 'were', 'wrong.First', 'who', 'think', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'just', 'pretty', 'boy', 'was', 'basically', 'opinion', 'movie', 'mistaken', 'notion', 'rest', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'role', 'enormously', 'demanding', 'physically', 'mentally', 'artistically', 'emotionally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anybody', 'could', 'play', 'role', 'still', 'be', 'same', 'person', 'Someday', 'memoirs', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'going', 'talk', 'being', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Stone.And', 'second', 'Stone', 'treatment', 'sex', 'life', 'Viet', 'Vets', 'wheelchairs', 'absolutely', 'sentimentality', 'silver', 'lining', 'are', 'rose', 'petals', 'soft', 'pedaling', 'was', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Coming', 'Home', 'play', 'angel', 'love', 'Instead', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'friend', 'understandably', 'went', 'own', 'way', 'love', 'became', 'something', 'bought', 'could', 'afford', 'it.And', 'third', 'Stone', 'depiction', 'America', 'movie', 'really', 'America', '1950s', '1970s', 'pseudo-innocence', 'childhood', 'war', 'games', '4th', 'July', 'parades', 'down', 'Main', 'street', 'USA', 'having', 'guts', 'spilled', 'foreign', 'land', 'brothers-in-arms', 'being', 'sent', 'home', 'body', 'bags', 'was', 'as', 'indelible', 'black', 'ink', 'white', 'parchment', 'proud', 'moms', 'patriotic', 'homilies', 'shameful', 'neglect', 'Veteran', 'hospitals', 'bloody', 'anti-war', 'demonstrators', 'police', 'convention', 'halls', 'where', 'reveling', 'conventioneers', 'wave', 'flags', 'mouth', 'phony', 'slogans.I', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'Stone', 'work', 'as', 'far', 'fidelity', 'authentic', 'detail', 'sustained', 'concentration', 'best', 'are', 'thousand', 'details', 'Stone', 'got', 'exactly', 'right', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'paperback', 'novel', 'paraplegic', 'WW', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'sat', 'tray', 'Kovic', 'hospital', 'bed', 'black', 'medic', 'telling', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'war', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'namely', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'mother', 'throwing', 'son', 'house', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'fulfilled', 'trophy', 'case', 'vision', 'what', 'son', 'ought', 'be', 'Willem', 'DaFoe', 'remark', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'sexually', 'when', 'nothing', 'middle', 'moves.Also', 'striking', 'were', 'scenes', 'particular', 'confession', 'scene', 'home', 'boy', 'Kovic', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'Mexican', 'brothel', 'scene', 'sex/love', 'desperation', 'drunken', 'scene', 'pool', 'hall', 'bar', 'pretty', 'girl', 'face', 'then', 'drunken', 'hate-filled', 'rage', 'mother', 'course', 'savage', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'others', 'were', 'deeply', 'moving', 'likely', 'haunt', 'many', 'years', 'come.Of', 'course', 'usual', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'political', 'message', 'weighed', 'heavily', 'artistic', 'purpose', 'Straight-laced', 'conservatives', 'will', 'find', 'portrait', 'America', 'one-sided', 'offensive', 'something', ""'d"", 'rather', 'forget', 'imagine', 'guys', 'who', 'fought', 'Vietnam', 'managed', 'get', 'back', 'somehow', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'redemptive', 'Certainly', 'watch', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'just', 'ordinary', 'Joe', 'who', 'believed', 'country', 'sentiments', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'comic', 'book', 'heroics', 'go', 'depressed', 'enraged', 'drug-addled', 'waste', 'human', 'being', 'enlightened', 'focused', 'articulate', 'ultimately', 'triumphant', 'spokesman', 'anti-war', 'movement', 'veterans', 'disabled', 'was', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Stone', 'Kovic', 'really', 'did', 'become', 'hero', 'misguided', 'mother', 'dreamed', 'would', 'be.No', 'other', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'movie', 'one', 'something', 'coming', 'back', 'less', 'whole', 'worse', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'away', 'consciousness', 'yet', 'end', 'here', 'displayed', 'triumph', 'human', 'will', 'story', 'how', 'man', 'might', 'find', 'redemption', 'most', 'deplorable', 'circumstances']",N/A

Ron  joins the Marines in the early 1960's, wanting to join in fear that Vietnam  would end before he got there. Well, he catches the &quot;train&quot; to  'Nam....and is a model Marine, making Sergeant quickly. After doing two  regretful things in Vietnam, his Catholic-raised conscience eats away at  him....but he doesn't have to live for it for too long, because he gets  shot in a fierce firefight and paralyzed from the chest down. He comes home  expecting to be a hero, just like his WWII Veteran father, and all the vets  of previous wars.

He realizes that  the war is really wrong, and joins the anti-war movement.This film is so  sad, so great, and just plain amazing. The patriotic music, as well as John  Williams' score, is used wonderfully. The all-American parade song in the  beginning (in the way that it is used) is really haunting. Again, the  acting, especially Cruise's, is just wonderful. While I sensed some  anti-American themes in there that Oliver Stone seemed to purposely throw  in (maybe displaying his views? Well, it bothered me because I disagree  with those views), BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY really changes your life  after you see it...you can't stop thinking about it. Some scenes make you  cry, some are very nostalgic of that naive childhood attitude we all had at  one point. This film will bring a tear to your eye, make you cringe, and  make you smile. All in all, it is very powerful. Highly reccomended (as  well as the great book).",5,One of the greatest anti-war epics ever....,931132800,"07 5, 1999",1999,1958,"['BORN', 'ON', 'THE', 'FOURTH', 'OF', 'JULY', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'played', 'so', 'beautifully', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'wow', 'What', 'performance', 'nice', 'Long', 'Island', 'NY', 'boy', 'who', 'dedicated', 'Catholic', 'High', 'School', 'athlete', 'good', 'patriotic', 'American', 'Ron', 'Marines', 'early', '1960', 'wanting', 'join', 'fear', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'end', 'got', 'there', 'Well', 'quot', 'quot', ""'Nam"", '.and', 'model', 'Marine', 'making', 'Sergeant', 'quickly', 'doing', 'two', 'regretful', 'things', 'Vietnam', 'Catholic-raised', 'conscience', 'away', '.but', ""n't"", 'have', 'live', 'too', 'long', 'shot', 'fierce', 'firefight', 'paralyzed', 'chest', 'down', 'home', 'expecting', 'be', 'hero', 'just', 'WWII', 'Veteran', 'father', 'vets', 'previous', 'wars', 'hero-worship', 'short-lived', 'America', 'once', 'knew', 'gone', 'dead', 'one', 'patriotic', 'one', 'veterans', 'everyone', 'burning', 'flags', 'downward', 'spiral', 'alchoholism', '.and', 'self-realization', 'war', 'really', 'wrong', 'anti-war', 'movement.This', 'film', 'so', 'sad', 'so', 'great', 'just', 'plain', 'amazing', 'patriotic', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'used', 'wonderfully', 'all-American', 'parade', 'song', 'beginning', 'way', 'used', 'really', 'haunting', 'Again', 'acting', 'especially', 'Cruise', 'just', 'wonderful', 'sensed', 'anti-American', 'themes', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'seemed', 'purposely', 'throw', 'maybe', 'displaying', 'views', 'Well', 'bothered', 'disagree', 'views', 'BORN', 'ON', 'THE', 'FOURTH', 'OF', 'JULY', 'really', 'life', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'scenes', 'make', 'cry', 'are', 'very', 'nostalgic', 'naive', 'childhood', 'attitude', 'had', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'make', 'cringe', 'make', 'smile', 'very', 'powerful', 'Highly', 'reccomended', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'book']",N/A
56381,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,0783226764,drqshadow,"[2, 7]","The second of Oliver Stone's three films on the subject of Vietnam, this one stars Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic, a wounded war vet who comes home to discover the grateful reception he expected isn't waiting for him. Though the film is closely based on a true story, it also functions as a rather obvious metaphor for the rapid transition of America's public attitude from the happy-go-lucky family values of the '50s to the conspiratorial uncertainty of the early '70s. At the time this was something of a reach for Cruise, who was only just starting to branch out into serious roles, and the strong performance opened up new horizons for his career. His acting shines, especially in the dark, depressing pits to which his character eventually sinks, but the storyline could use some smoothing. Almost overnight Kovic's attitudes about his country spin 180-degrees, swapping one extreme perspective for another just minutes after he's shouted down his younger brother over the kitchen table for doing the same thing. An awkward almost-love-story is shoehorned into his character arc, then disappears around the middle of the picture and never resurfaces. It's a passionate rallying cry for the cause of the railroaded, confused Vietnam vets who were punished for doing what they thought was the right thing, but despite several strong performances from its cast it's needlessly long and routinely uneven.",3,"A Dark, Depressing Apology for Vietnam That Never Fully Connects Emotionally",1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,1399,"['second', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'three', 'films', 'subject', 'Vietnam', 'one', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'wounded', 'war', 'vet', 'who', 'home', 'discover', 'grateful', 'reception', 'expected', ""n't"", 'waiting', 'film', 'closely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'also', 'rather', 'obvious', 'metaphor', 'rapid', 'transition', 'America', 'public', 'attitude', 'happy-go-lucky', 'family', 'values', ""'50s"", 'conspiratorial', 'uncertainty', 'early', 'time', 'was', 'something', 'reach', 'Cruise', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'just', 'starting', 'branch', 'out', 'serious', 'roles', 'strong', 'performance', 'opened', 'up', 'new', 'horizons', 'career', 'acting', 'shines', 'especially', 'dark', 'depressing', 'pits', 'character', 'eventually', 'storyline', 'could', 'use', 'smoothing', 'Almost', 'overnight', 'Kovic', 'attitudes', 'country', 'spin', '180-degrees', 'swapping', 'one', 'extreme', 'perspective', 'just', 'minutes', 'shouted', 'down', 'younger', 'brother', 'kitchen', 'table', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'awkward', 'almost-love-story', 'shoehorned', 'character', 'arc', 'then', 'middle', 'picture', 'never', 'resurfaces', 'passionate', 'rallying', 'cry', 'cause', 'railroaded', 'confused', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'who', 'were', 'punished', 'doing', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'several', 'strong', 'performances', 'cast', 'needlessly', 'long', 'routinely', 'uneven']",N/A

56383,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0783226764,Erik North,"[10, 11]","In PLATOON, director Oliver Stone showed us the horrors of the Vietnam war from ground zero.  Three years after that, with BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, he takes us to what the war did to America and has us see it through the eyes of another Vietnam vet, Ron Kovic, who co-wrote the screenplay with Stone from his own 1976 memoir.  Tom Cruise portrays Kovic, and gives one of the best onscreen performances of modern times.Kovic was a kid from Massapequa, New York who grew up believing in the post-World War II beliefs of American superiority, anticommunism, and John Wayne, and who wanted to serve his country.  But in Vietnam, he had the tragic misfortune of being shot by a VC bullet and paralysed from the waist down.  He would now never be able to have children, and he would never walk again.  Like a lot of Vietnam vets, he was met either with indifference or hostility to his suffering.  He became embittered and hostile in his own way.But he soon learned that his experience could be used for a greater purpose than war: to educate Americans about the realities behind the myths that helped tear America apart during the 1960s and 1970s.Although a long film at 140 minutes plus, BORN is a stunning look not only at Kovic's personal experiences, but the experiences of our nation when we moved from braggadocio and John Wayne patriotism to cynicism and political violence.  Never in this movie do Stone or Kovic ever say that Vietnam vets didn't serve their country proud.  They do, however, indict the culture of paranoia and anticommunism that worshipped a supposed &quot;patriot&quot; like John Wayne, who NEVER saw any combat action in his life.  And on that count, they must be commended fully.It is an honor to serve one's country, but when you don't know the truth about what you're supposedly fighting for, the results can be devastating.  That is what Stone and Kovic say was wrong with America's Vietnam experience, and I can't help but believe they were 200% right.",5,Debunking a lot of dangerous myths,996537600,"07 31, 2001",2001,1983,"['PLATOON', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'showed', 'horrors', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'ground', 'zero', 'Three', 'years', 'BORN', 'ON', 'THE', 'FOURTH', 'OF', 'JULY', 'what', 'war', 'did', 'America', 'see', 'eyes', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Stone', 'own', '1976', 'memoir', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Kovic', 'one', 'best', 'onscreen', 'performances', 'modern', 'times.Kovic', 'was', 'kid', 'Massapequa', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'believing', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'beliefs', 'American', 'superiority', 'anticommunism', 'John', 'Wayne', 'who', 'wanted', 'serve', 'country', 'Vietnam', 'had', 'tragic', 'misfortune', 'being', 'shot', 'VC', 'bullet', 'paralysed', 'waist', 'down', 'would', 'now', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'children', 'would', 'never', 'walk', 'again', 'lot', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'was', 'met', 'either', 'indifference', 'hostility', 'suffering', 'became', 'embittered', 'hostile', 'own', 'way.But', 'soon', 'learned', 'experience', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'greater', 'purpose', 'war', 'educate', 'Americans', 'realities', 'myths', 'helped', 'tear', 'America', 'apart', '1960s', '1970s.Although', 'long', 'film', '140', 'minutes', 'BORN', 'stunning', 'look', 'not', 'only', 'Kovic', 'personal', 'experiences', 'experiences', 'nation', 'when', 'moved', 'braggadocio', 'John', 'Wayne', 'patriotism', 'cynicism', 'political', 'violence', 'Never', 'movie', 'do', 'Stone', 'Kovic', 'ever', 'say', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'did', ""n't"", 'serve', 'country', 'proud', 'do', 'however', 'indict', 'culture', 'paranoia', 'anticommunism', 'worshipped', 'supposed', 'quot', 'quot', 'John', 'Wayne', 'who', 'NEVER', 'saw', 'combat', 'action', 'life', 'count', 'must', 'be', 'commended', 'fully.It', 'honor', 'serve', 'one', 'country', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'truth', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposedly', 'fighting', 'results', 'can', 'be', 'devastating', 'what', 'Stone', 'Kovic', 'say', 'was', 'wrong', 'America', 'Vietnam', 'experience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'believe', 'were', '200', '%', 'right']",N/A

I guess one of the points to the movie that I missed was that I was supposed to feel sorry for Ron throughout the movie.  The only time I ever felt sorry for him was when he was stuck in the hospital and no one took care of him.  With the exception of him becoming disabled and was in the hospital, I felt that he brought a lot of  his troubles on himself.Another point to this movie that I missed was that his being disabled and fighting in a terrible war gave him an excuse to do whatever he wanted.  Rather than getting a job or doing something useful, he drank, told his sad story to anyone who wanted to listen, and cussed at his parents who take care of him.  Oh yeah, he took a trip to Mexico to be touched by a hooker and fought with another disabled vet.The third point that I missed was that Ron changed his view on the war because of everything that he suffered.  Going back to point number one I felt that he brought a lot of the troubles on himself.  Before he went on his trip to Mexico, his girlfriend rejectes him because he is disabled and doesn't agree with her views on the war.  The movie also shows his brother arguing with him over the war.The last point that I missed in the movie was that I am supposed to think that Ron found some kind of purpose in his life by speaking out against the war.  So what?  He does it because of point number three.  Ron has only changed his views on the war but he is still the same selfish person that he was before the war.

56385,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,0783226764,Giordano Bruno,"[4, 4]","Ron Kovic is a genuine hero. Born literally on the 4th of July in 1946, he served two tours as a Marine in Vietnam, suffered wounds that resulted in total paralysis of his lower body, returned to America horribly traumatized and disillusioned, became a prominent anti-war demonstrator and put his heroism to the test by confronting his own community, a hostile nation, tactical police squads, jail, the goons surrounding Richard Nixon, and his own debilities and despair. His autobiography is the basis of this 1989 film directed by Oliver Stone. Kovic and Stone collaborated on the screenplay. It seems that only two interpolations were demanded by Stone, for 'artistic' reasons: the childhood sweetheart Donna played by Kyra Sedgwick is imagined, and the confessional meeting by Kovic with the parents of the fellow marine he killed in friendly fire never happened.Otherwise, Stone's film is an extremely accurate depiction of the anti-Vietnam protests of the late 1960s and early 1970s. I know. I was there. I never met Kovic, but I knew people who knew him. I was in the throngs at some of the same demonstrations. I can't testify to the accuracy of the war scenes in Vietnam. I wasn't there. I followed my own conscience and confronted other demons. The only 'objection' I would make to Stone's portrayal of the anti-Vietnam protests is that there is a disproportion in the images of the protestors. The forefront protestors in Stone's film are nearly all ""hippies"" -- counterculture youth, bearded, beaded, brazen -- while in reality every demonstration I saw (after 1964 or so) had large numbers of quite ordinary ""straight"" citizens, middle class, middle-aged, etc. Stone portrays the ""other side"" -- the war hawks, the Miami Convention delegates who chanted ""Four! More! Years"" to celebrate the renomination of Nixon, for instance -- harshly but with precise realism. This is eventually a film about fanaticism, about the inevitable conflict between ideology and basic humanity. It was bound to be controversial when it was made, bound to be hated by the 'Love It or Leave it"" super-patriots. I'm sure it would still be hated by the extremists of the Tea Party. It IS an indictment of America's stupidity and misconduct in Vietnam. It IS an indictment of the shameful mistreatment that the returning Vietnam Vets have suffered in a country that glorifies their ""service"" but despises their personhood. It IS a denunciation of all wars. War is not ""diplomacy by other means"" as the German historian called it; war is the failure of civilization.Oliver Stone has made twenty (20!) films, many of them box-office successes. Would you believe that I've never seen any of them first-run? I spent most of the late '70s, '80s and '90s outside the USA. The very first Stone film I've ever seen -- on DVD quite recently -- was ""Wall Street,"" brought to my attention by an amazoo cagemate. I was hugely impressed, not only by the content but also by the art of direction and cinematography. ""Wall Street"" is extremely well made as a film. Michael Douglas, in the role of Gordon Gekko, is an emotional powerhouse. Camera work, editing, musical support -- all brilliant!  Naturally, being the extravagant dude I am, I immediately purchased a whole retrospective box of 14 discs of Stone's works. ""Born on the Fourth"" is the first one I've watched from that collection, and it's close enough to being a masterpiece of cinema that I consider my money well spent. Oliver Stone appears to be a volatile personality. He's made statements that I've found profoundly confused and even offensive. But the two films of his I've seen so far have exhibited masterful control of the medium and clear focus of the message.",5,"""Arms and the Man I Sing...."" - Virgil (70-19 BCE)",1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,3706,"['Ron', 'Kovic', 'genuine', 'hero', 'Born', 'literally', '4th', 'July', '1946', 'served', 'two', 'tours', 'Marine', 'Vietnam', 'suffered', 'wounds', 'resulted', 'total', 'paralysis', 'lower', 'body', 'returned', 'America', 'horribly', 'traumatized', 'disillusioned', 'became', 'prominent', 'anti-war', 'demonstrator', 'put', 'heroism', 'test', 'confronting', 'own', 'community', 'hostile', 'nation', 'tactical', 'police', 'squads', 'jail', 'goons', 'surrounding', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'own', 'debilities', 'despair', 'autobiography', 'basis', '1989', 'film', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Kovic', 'Stone', 'collaborated', 'screenplay', 'only', 'two', 'interpolations', 'were', 'demanded', 'Stone', ""'artistic"", 'reasons', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Donna', 'played', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'imagined', 'confessional', 'meeting', 'Kovic', 'parents', 'fellow', 'marine', 'killed', 'friendly', 'fire', 'never', 'happened.Otherwise', 'Stone', 'film', 'extremely', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'anti-Vietnam', 'protests', 'late', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'know', 'was', 'there', 'never', 'met', 'Kovic', 'knew', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'throngs', 'same', 'demonstrations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'testify', 'accuracy', 'war', 'scenes', 'Vietnam', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'followed', 'own', 'conscience', 'confronted', 'other', 'demons', 'only', ""'objection"", 'would', 'make', 'Stone', 'portrayal', 'anti-Vietnam', 'protests', 'disproportion', 'images', 'protestors', 'forefront', 'protestors', 'Stone', 'film', 'are', 'nearly', 'hippies', 'counterculture', 'youth', 'bearded', 'beaded', 'brazen', 'reality', 'demonstration', 'saw', '1964', 'so', 'had', 'large', 'numbers', 'quite', 'ordinary', 'straight', 'citizens', 'middle', 'class', 'middle-aged', 'etc', 'Stone', 'other', 'side', 'war', 'hawks', 'Miami', 'Convention', 'delegates', 'who', 'chanted', 'Four', 'More', 'Years', 'celebrate', 'renomination', 'Nixon', 'instance', 'harshly', 'precise', 'realism', 'eventually', 'film', 'fanaticism', 'inevitable', 'conflict', 'ideology', 'basic', 'humanity', 'was', 'bound', 'be', 'controversial', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'bound', 'be', 'hated', ""'Love"", 'Leave', 'super-patriots', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'hated', 'extremists', 'Tea', 'Party', 'indictment', 'America', 'stupidity', 'misconduct', 'Vietnam', 'indictment', 'shameful', 'mistreatment', 'returning', 'Vietnam', 'Vets', 'have', 'suffered', 'country', 'service', 'personhood', 'denunciation', 'wars', 'War', 'not', 'diplomacy', 'other', 'means', 'German', 'historian', 'called', 'war', 'failure', 'civilization.Oliver', 'Stone', 'made', 'twenty', '20', 'films', 'many', 'box-office', 'successes', 'Would', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'first-run', 'spent', 'most', 'late', ""'70s"", ""'80s"", ""'90s"", 'USA', 'very', 'first', 'Stone', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'quite', 'recently', 'was', 'Wall', 'Street', 'brought', 'attention', 'amazoo', 'cagemate', 'was', 'hugely', 'impressed', 'not', 'only', 'content', 'also', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'Wall', 'Street', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'role', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'emotional', 'powerhouse', 'Camera', 'work', 'editing', 'musical', 'support', 'brilliant', 'Naturally', 'being', 'extravagant', 'dude', 'am', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'whole', 'retrospective', 'box', '14', 'discs', 'Stone', 'works', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'first', 'one', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'collection', 'close', 'enough', 'being', 'masterpiece', 'cinema', 'consider', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'be', 'volatile', 'personality', 'made', 'statements', ""'ve"", 'found', 'profoundly', 'confused', 'even', 'offensive', 'two', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'exhibited', 'masterful', 'control', 'medium', 'clear', 'focus', 'message']",N/A

Cruise forgoes his easy way out with a smile and shows (as he has in several other films) he really has acting chops.It is impossible not to be moved by Cruise's inhabiting the life of Ron Kovic and to feel the pain, the displacement and abandonment Kovic - and thousands of other soldiers - must have felt.  That Kovic was a patriot, a hero actually born on the 4th of July makes his outspoken acts of anti-war activism resonate all the more.Those - like me - who have accused this actor of not being to act his way out of the proverbial paper bag should take a look at Mr. Cruise here.  Watching his Kovic from idealistic young man, to disenchanted hero, to miserable self-pitying to inspiration and a voice the voice of realism for a generation realist will be nothing less than wowed.  At each step, Cruise puts Kovic first and foremost and makes believable every emotion.  There is more than self-pity when, knowing how he's going to spend the balance of his life he cries ""who will love me?""  It will break your heart and fill you with rage all at once.The supporting cast, under Stone's direction bring alive a harrowing story - a true story.The extras on this special wide screen version are not worth shouting about - but are worth noting.

56387,A1X28NWPDMTDG7,0783226764,Gregg Hillier,"[0, 0]","""Born On The Fourth of July"" is a faithful, searing adaptation of Ron Kovic's short but devastating memoir. Oliver Stone, himself a Viet Nam Vet with some serious issues, co-wrote the Oscar-winning script with Kovic and Directs with unrelenting focus. While ""Platoon"" showed how life really was in Viet Nam, ""Born"" is more about the aftermath. The story follows Kovic from a High School jock to a paraplegic Marine suffering the horrors of a filthy VA Hospital and finally an embittered Patriot that no one understands. Casting this role must have caused Stone great anguish and his choice of Tom Cruise nets a mixed result. Cruise is perfect as a young Kovic but is less successful as Kovic loses himself in booze and self pity.

Anyone thinking about joining the military should be interested, because anyone joining the military should be not only be prepared to fight, but be prepared for the consequences.A good question posed in this movie comes when the main character is getting drunk and having a tantrum at a local bar.  A solid WWII former Marine who fought in Iwo tells him ""we lost 6,000 guys the first day, what are you crying about?""  Well, I think the answer to that question is that the US won WWII, Americans were proud of the veterans, and this provided wounded veterans with a justification for their suffering.  We lost Vietnam, we didn't gain any territory, and Americans didn't display the same support for Vietnam vets as they did for WWII vets.  Wounded Vietnam vets are constantly plagued by the thought that they sacrificed so much for so little, and it's more difficult for them to accept their loss.Of course, regardless of their war, the capabilities of wounded vets depends largely on the vet's mentality.  But, regardless of their individual ability to cope with their wounds, no one can argue that the nation shouldn't support them generously.Anyway, this is a pretty good flick, and definitely an important one to watch, since hardly any war movies deal with life after the bullets stop flying, except maybe a couple foreign flicks and ""Johnny Got His Gun.""-- JJ Timmins",3,"Hate war, but honor veterans",1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,1510,"['most', 'war', 'movies', 'focus', 'courageousness', 'bravado', 'combatants', 'one', 'what', 'life', 'wounded', 'veterans', 'Anyone', 'thinking', 'joining', 'military', 'should', 'be', 'interested', 'anyone', 'joining', 'military', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'prepared', 'fight', 'be', 'prepared', 'consequences.A', 'good', 'question', 'posed', 'movie', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'getting', 'drunk', 'having', 'tantrum', 'local', 'bar', 'solid', 'WWII', 'former', 'Marine', 'who', 'fought', 'Iwo', 'lost', '6,000', 'guys', 'first', 'day', 'what', 'are', 'crying', 'Well', 'think', 'answer', 'question', 'US', 'won', 'WWII', 'Americans', 'were', 'proud', 'veterans', 'provided', 'wounded', 'veterans', 'justification', 'suffering', 'lost', 'Vietnam', 'did', ""n't"", 'gain', 'territory', 'Americans', 'did', ""n't"", 'display', 'same', 'support', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'did', 'WWII', 'vets', 'Wounded', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'are', 'constantly', 'plagued', 'thought', 'sacrificed', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'more', 'difficult', 'accept', 'loss.Of', 'course', 'regardless', 'war', 'capabilities', 'wounded', 'vets', 'largely', 'vet', 'mentality', 'regardless', 'individual', 'ability', 'cope', 'wounds', 'one', 'can', 'argue', 'nation', 'should', ""n't"", 'support', 'generously.Anyway', 'pretty', 'good', 'flick', 'definitely', 'important', 'one', 'watch', 'hardly', 'war', 'movies', 'deal', 'life', 'bullets', 'stop', 'flying', 'maybe', 'couple', 'foreign', 'flicks', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'JJ', 'Timmins']",N/A

This movie depicts with heartbreaking realism the experience of an All-American boy who comes home from the Vietnam War paralyzed from the waist down. Surely it can't be considered political to tell that story, can it? That would be the specious and self-interested argument of your typical neocon warmonger, who would like to keep the cameras away from Walter Reed, where the 19 and 20 year old victims of their phony war learn to cope with life without arms or legs or recognizably human faces. I think it's a good thing for the flag-waving public to understand the consequences of their jingoism and see what soldiers have to sacrifice. This movie makes that lesson quite clear. It can be raw and explicit, but so is getting your spinal cord snapped in two. Tom Cruise gives a fantastic performance here, the supporting cast is first rate, and the extraordinary attention to visual detail combine to create a moving and powerful film. My one complaint is that it doesn't really explain Kovic's conversion from super-patriot to anti-war activist, and represents him as a singularly inarticulate spokesman, at that. It seems to present his argument as amounting to nothing more than ""I'm mad"" and ""The government lied!"".

I grew up in Massapequa, knew Ron Kovic (slightly), hung out at Arthur's Bar, got my hair cut at Sparky The Barber's, I played in Sally's Woods as a kid, and watched God knows how many holiday parades down Broadway. Growing up, they occurred on every major holiday except The Feast of The Assumption.Massapequa's the kind of place you love and hate at the same time. It's a fly in the amber. The schools are excellent. Businesses like All-American and Krisch's Ice Cream Parlor have been there since 1955 and remain surprisingly unchanged. The town's underlying values remain intact, mostly because the kids that grew up there in the Fifties inherited their parents' houses and have passed them on to their kids now. On the Fourth of July the smoke from ""illegal"" fireworks is so dense that spy satellites can't penetrate it (this is a documented fact). There's been a spate of new construction, if you can consider a spate to have lasted 25 years, but beyond that, it's still home as I remember it.So the ersatz Massapequa (a town in Vermont that they dressed up) in this film was a little disconcerting to me: ""Lemke Hardware wasn't even on the same street as Krisch's, and Krisch's is Krisch's, not Boyer's!""Hollywood.And this wasn't even the original film. The original BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY by Brian DePalma starred Al Pacino and was made, or partly made, in 1978. The Internet Movie Database tells me that the ""financing fell through"" but I can recall the Pequa Theater marquee showing ""Love Story"" during some filming. They were actually going to use Massapequa to represent Massapequa in that version.Actually, the sets don't bother me half as much as Tom Cruise. Pacino would have made this movie a TRUE classic. Cruise is real good at playing the teenaged Ronnie Kovic, but he utterly blows the role once Ronnie Gets His Gun. Cruise spends most of the movie overacting shamelessly, like yelling ""Penis, penis, penis!"" in a badly-acted ""drunk"" scene, and turning the heart-rending bitter anger of Ron Kovic's searingly sad book into something like pablum for the ease of audience digestion. We needed grit and despair in this movie. We got Tom Cruise, and not the Tom Cruise of A FEW GOOD MEN or THE LAST SAMURAI, we got the Tom Cruise of Jumping On Oprah's Couch Tom Cruise.War is hell.

Stone's directing, for which he won an Oscar, is flawless.In his role, Tom Cruise plays a young, ambitious, patriotic Ron Kovic, itching to serve in Vietnam and fight for Democracy and American values. He leaves behind his girlfriend and his family for a chaotic, hellish war. His platoon kills women and children. With the heat and dust muddling his vision and the steady staccato of gunshots impairing his senses, Kovic fatally shoots one of his own men. On a similar day, a half-crazed, expletive-screaming Kovic is wounded. At a hospital overrun by the dying, Kovic's last rights are administered. You can see everything on Cruise's face: guilt, pain, fear and acceptance of death.But he doesn't die; instead, he returns home a paralyzed misfit.

Most regard Platoon as the best of this &quot;trilogy,&quot; although I always preferred this one. Platoon was gritty and realistic, but this was powerful and more emotionally driven. Until I saw this film, I didn't have much respect for Tom Cruise as an actor, but everything changed afterwards. Cruise goes through a number of critical changes throughout this film, from a patriotic young man to a bitter, crippled veteran, and he does it better than you could imagine.Cruise is the young athlete Ron Kovic, an idealistic and patriotic American who joins the Marines to fight in the Vietnam War. When he gets there, his brash eagerness is diluted by horror when he accidentally kills one of his own men. The pains in his heart are compounded by a bullet wound that leaves him paralyzed from the chest down. Returning home, he steadfastly clings to his national spirit, which puts him in conflict with the populace's growing aversion to the mess in Vietnam. He winds up in Mexico as a tormented drunkard, then reforms and becomes an anti-Vietnam activist, writing the autobiographical book on which this movie is based.This movie is tremendously powerful because of its acute historical significance, strong anti-war message, and Tom Cruise's stunning acting. The movie is sad and wrenching, but it ends with an uplifting note of someone who rises above the pain and hate to a stronger condition. This is Oliver Stone's best film, I think.

I was involved in marriage, family, career and had left the 60s behind for awhile. I had the privilege of doing that; Ron Kovic could not. Reading the reviews at that time, I knew this movie would be too intense for me, and a few years later, when my husband would suffer a major stroke and become partially paralyzed himself, causing both of us to endure years of rehabilitation, I deliberately avoided the movie whenever it aired on TV.  What I had glimpsed was too raw and authentic--I had enough of that in my own life.But I watched it tonight on AMC and marvelled at the film--Stone's brilliant directing, Kovic's terrible honesty about his journey, Cruise's willingness to ""go there.""  This is perhaps Stone's greatest movie, thoughtful to the tiniest artistic detail; director is too shallow a title for his achievement with this film.  Kovic--it is his story that inspires me to write this review.  Three years after my husband died--he lived nearly 10 years with his disability--I understood all too well Kovic's path.  The fact that he kept going, that he didn't give up even when life was dark, painful, and utterly bizarre is simply amazing.  Having to face ""aloneness"" and ""dependence"" and life without ""equipment"" is the most terrifying experience one can deal with.  My husband had me.  He knew he was loved everyday.  Ron had none of that, but, thank God, he found a community and a mission--one that he sought and created.  What kind of strength is that?  It comes only when you face that awful test in life that none of us wants, that we'll do anything to avoid.  Those who have encountered it are either dead by choice or alive and transformed.

But the causes of the wars -- and the consequences -- are the same.I knew Ron Kovic casually and if you read the credits you will see that he co-wrote the script. It's absolutely honest and there's nothing superfluous in the movie. He hits on major events in his life, during peace time as well as war, and shows us the monumental changes that occurred not only in his life but in the country as a whole.I remember watching on TV as Ron rolled his wheelchair down to the floor of the convention hall. Already a member of the antiwar movement, I broke down crying when I saw him do that. And I cried harder when I saw how the convention members reacted. I think people who don't know or remember this period need to see this.When I heard they were making a movie of Ron's book, I was really happy.  Then they announced Tom Cruise would play Ron and I was really upset.  But, I'll tell you, Cruise's performance was excellent.Other reviews here, if you've waded through all of them, tell you all the details of the movie.

This movie pushes a political message, but one which should always be reiterated, and that is War Has Its Price.  Literally, physically, psychologically and figuratively.  As a matter of fact, I would encourage any young man joining the armed services to take a look at it.  Perhaps Congress should view it every time they debate declaring war.This movie is, what Stone calls, a &#34;critical look at the recruiting poster mentality&#34; in this country, a takedown of institutionalized groupthink.  Stone believes there is something wrong happening during our American adolescence, which pushes competition, is male driven, and makes everyone strive to be #1.  This has disastrous consequences, Stone says.  You see this in the film with Ron Kovic's interaction with his mother, who he later blames, unfairly, for his circumstances.Stone also takes on America's sense of false patriotism.  That mentality that suggests you must love and support every action your country takes, at home and abroad, right or wrong.  But also on display, is a sense of REAL patriotism, which we can admire.  Kovic is affected by Kennedy's words &#34;ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.&#34;  He is full of youthful idealism, and he is dedicated to making a sacrifice for his country.  This is noble and admirable.The scenes of Kovic suffering in the VA hospital all ring true today, where we have a VA scandal in our own time.  A country that sent many young men and women overseas to fight, but somehow can't afford to pay for their medical care upon return.At it's core, this is simply the story of a man changing his mind: beginning as a pro-war teen, to a human rights activist and war protester.  Yes, the film is about ideology, but when you look at the world through Kovic's eyes you understand why he believes the way he does.  And you certainly can't fault him for it.Governments lied about Gulf of Tonkin, just as they lied about WMD in Iraq.  Perhaps we can do better to broaden the conversation and shine a spotlight on America's intelligence agencies, instead of laying the blame entirely on one president.  Because there is a pattern here, with Daniel Elsberg and now Edward Snowden, separated by generations.I'm sorry to get political at the end of this review, but I think it's something the movie wants us to consider.

Tom Cruise provides one of the most outstanding performances of his career playing Kovic, with an abundance of energy and passion. The movie delves into a side of war that is often out of sight, which is the path to rehabilitation following serious injury. Having been an instrument of war, who served without question, Kovic's transition from loyal servant to objector is well conveyed by a strong film narrative.

You think about the movie, what it means, and you talk about it for days. It changes your perception of things on many levels. This is one those movies. I am still in awe of the movie that I have watched maybe 6 times. Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise have brought a brilliant story about the war to life.First of, this is not exactly a war movie, but it revolves around a war. It shows the effects of the war to the people who were in it and the general public who have no idea what exactly is going on. This is a story of Ron Kovic, an all-American kid from Long Island. He is full of passion for his country and he believes in serving his country, not caring whether he dies in the process. He eagerly enrolls in the Marine Corp and before he knows it, he is sent to Vietnam fighting in the front line. Some things happen there that leaves a huge impact on Ron and also he was paralyzed from a battle with the communists. He finds himself in a hospital and they have to amputate his legs. He then returns home to find that not everyone sees eye to eye on the war situation in Vietnam, many look at him with embarassment and repulse. In an instant, he had gone from hero to zero.What really grabbed me about this movie was the story. It doesn't show the war in detail, but more what the war does to it's soldiers and the people involved. It's amazing how they show things from an individual's point of view. It shows the terrible effects of war that you just cannot watch on CNN. Through this movie, it opened my eyes that wars do not just leave towns/cities in destruction or leave people killed...it also effects the people who survived. The trauma and the pain they go through. It's hard to just pick up where you left. And yeah, everyone will be there when things are going well, but who'll be left when things go awry? When you lose your legs and need nursing?I have to say, kudos to Cruise for giving an Oscar-worthy performance. I honestly felt he deserved the statuette for this role. It's hard to imagine anyone else pulling of the part as perfectly as he did. From humble and innocent beginnings, to a torn and desperate man left scarred for life. You can feel the emotion he's going through all the way. It's not hard to imagine yourself doing the same if you were in his shoes. This role defined Tom Cruise as an actor, and he has definitely earned a place in my book as one of the best actors around. The movie also has a slew of talented actors but most appear in brief sequences but due to Cruise's brilliant performance, it doesn't really matter.Oliver Stone is one of the great directors of our time (other than Alexander) so his direction of this movie is no surprise, it's practically flawless. He does it so well, each scene is classic and invokes emotion that movies rarely create. And the score of the movie by John Williams is also fantastic. The music that appears in the parade earlier on in the movie, when the war veterans are marching by with broken legs and arms...kinda like a preview of things to come, brilliant!This movie will be remembered for a long time and it really makes you sad that wars are still going on around the world. You wish that those people could watch movies like this and realize that it destroys something more than nations or buildings, it destroys the very essence of life.

Charting Kovic's transition from blindly patriotic, gung-ho high school senior to bitter, cynical war veteran and anti-war activist, Stone paints a convincing and depressing portrait of a generation betrayed by their political leaders, leaving you emotionally devastated and politically angry. A totally disarming career best performance by Cruise, who - in any other year - would have walked away with the Oscar for Best Actor (as it was at the time, he was up against the world's greatest living actor, Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot). Weighed down slightly by an ill-judged and arguably unnecessary diversion into Kovic's drinking, whoring and cussing experience of Mexico. Such is the power of the rest of the film, that the indulgence hardly costs it a deserved five stars. Cruise's performance is undoubtedly the heart of the movie and he delivers impressively with a performance of unexpected maturity and depth. Stone reinforces a convincing claim to being one of the last true remaining auteurs of American cinema.

Unlike his Academy Award winning Platoon, Born On The Fourth Of July is not based on Mr. Stone's war experiences, but is the true life story of Ron Kovic.  Mr. Kovic was an idealistic young man from Massapequa, Long Island who wanted nothing more than to join the Marines and serve his country in battle.  He joins the Marines after high school and ends up in combat in Vietnam.  It is very different than the solider games he played as a child.  He is forced to commit acts he could never have imagined, including destroying a village, unbeknownst to the unit, which isn't filled with Vietcong, but women and children and this lays the groundwork that helps to break his patriotic zeal.  Eventually he is wounded in combat and the injury to his leg renders him a paraplegic.  Back home in the States, he undergoes rehabilitation believing that he will walk again, but is forced to finally concede that he will be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.  Both he and his family have a difficult time dealing with his paralysis and he is burdened with fact that he will never have use of his lower body and will never be able to have sex.  He becomes extremely bitter and gets drunk all the time.  Finally after going off to a place in Mexico where other wounded vets have gone, he realizes that war is wrong and he is an example of the destruction it causes.  He joins a group of veterans against the war and joins in protest against it, faces opposition to his cause before it is accepted and until the final scene in the film where he shown about to go onto the stage and speak at the 1976 Democratic Convention.  Tom Cruise stars as Ron Kovic and gives a performance unlike any in his career.  He perfectly fits the image of the young Kovic, bright-eyed and fresh faced, but as he changes into the longhaired, unkempt wheelchaired bound Kovic, it is a Tom Cruise we had never seen before.  Mr. Cruise is brilliant and he deservedly was nominated for his first Academy Award, but lost out to another actor playing a man with an affliction, Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot.  The film was nominated for seven other Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Screenplay based on another medium in which Mr. Stone and Mr. Kovic shared the credit and it won two awards, one for Film Editing and Mr. Stone took home his second Best Director award.

56425,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,0783226764,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[3, 3]","Like other skeptics of this film, when I first picked it off the shelf, I was extremely skeptical of the film.  The cover looked pretty uninteresting, giving off the vibe of Coming Home or some other cheesy feel good hippy film with a hearty dose of sixties-seventies optimism.  It was directed by Oliver Stone, a man who is certainly not known for even handed portrayals of political subjects. And Tom Cruise, the pretty boy from the kitschy and lame beyond lame Top Gun, playing the lead?  How can this be any good of a film?Well, I'm entirely certain that I was completely wrong, very wrong.  This is a great movie, and the somewhat cheesy cover art and packaging of the film misleads you into what could be one of the most painful war movies that deal with the aftereffects of war, easily on the same line as the Deer Hunter.  No, it's not as scary as being confined to replaying Russian Roulette over and over again, but it's most certainly an emotionally distressing, and Tom Cruise does a fantastic job getting all of the suffering and misery across.  I've always thought Tom Cruise is a better actor than people give him credit for, and despite how annoying he can off camera (not to mention his spotty filmography) he still can certainly put a good performance if he chooses the right ones.  With all of this in line, this is one war film that deserves more praise than it gets, especially among audiences and film enthusiasts.Now, the film is not perfect (most films aren't, but that's another kettle of fish), and I know, like many Oliver Stone films, it's slanted towards the left; Vietnam the way Oliver Stone and Ron Kovic saw it (both very anti-war).  However, I feel that there certainly are many valid and interesting viewpoints made during the film, Also, Stone's genuine passion for the subject through experience makes it more worthwhile.  Most importantly though, it easily transcends these flaws with great acting, superb directing, great editing, a direct and raw approach to many of the displays of war (instead of extremely diminishing it with some stupid metaphor or symbol) and a spare-no-punches, gut instinct, intensity almost through the whole movie.  Best of all however, is it never loses touch with being a human.  For all the political points of view, Born on the Fourth of July, at heart, is still a humanistic study of one man's internal and external struggle with war, and it never loses it's characterization or real human struggles through any of it's views.Anyway, this is a great film, near the same level as Oliver Stone's Platoon (still haven't seen Heaven and Earth).  While some of the content in this film is definitely fiction, it shouldn't stop you from seeing this great film.  Tom Cruise has never been better, and Oliver Stone spares no punches and goes right for the gut (and very much succeeds).  It all adds up for a very exhausting, but ultimately uplifting and rewarding film.  Very highly recommended.",4,"A Fine, Underrated Film",1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,2958,"['other', 'skeptics', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'picked', 'off', 'shelf', 'was', 'extremely', 'skeptical', 'film', 'cover', 'looked', 'pretty', 'uninteresting', 'giving', 'off', 'vibe', 'Coming', 'Home', 'other', 'cheesy', 'feel', 'good', 'hippy', 'film', 'hearty', 'dose', 'sixties-seventies', 'optimism', 'was', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'man', 'who', 'certainly', 'not', 'known', 'even', 'handed', 'portrayals', 'political', 'subjects', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'pretty', 'boy', 'kitschy', 'lame', 'lame', 'Top', 'Gun', 'playing', 'lead', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'Well', ""'m"", 'entirely', 'certain', 'was', 'completely', 'wrong', 'very', 'wrong', 'great', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'cover', 'art', 'packaging', 'film', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'war', 'movies', 'deal', 'aftereffects', 'war', 'easily', 'same', 'line', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'No', 'not', 'as', 'scary', 'being', 'confined', 'replaying', 'Russian', 'Roulette', 'over', 'again', 'most', 'certainly', 'emotionally', 'distressing', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'fantastic', 'job', 'getting', 'suffering', 'misery', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'better', 'actor', 'people', 'give', 'credit', 'how', 'annoying', 'can', 'off', 'camera', 'not', 'mention', 'spotty', 'filmography', 'still', 'can', 'certainly', 'put', 'good', 'performance', 'right', 'ones', 'line', 'one', 'war', 'film', 'more', 'praise', 'especially', 'audiences', 'film', 'enthusiasts.Now', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'most', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'kettle', 'fish', 'know', 'many', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'films', 'slanted', 'left', 'Vietnam', 'way', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'saw', 'very', 'anti-war', 'However', 'feel', 'certainly', 'are', 'many', 'valid', 'interesting', 'viewpoints', 'made', 'film', 'Also', 'Stone', 'genuine', 'passion', 'subject', 'experience', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'Most', 'importantly', 'easily', 'flaws', 'great', 'acting', 'superb', 'directing', 'great', 'editing', 'direct', 'raw', 'approach', 'many', 'displays', 'war', 'instead', 'extremely', 'diminishing', 'stupid', 'metaphor', 'symbol', 'spare-no-punches', 'gut', 'instinct', 'intensity', 'almost', 'whole', 'movie', 'Best', 'however', 'never', 'touch', 'being', 'human', 'political', 'points', 'view', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'heart', 'still', 'humanistic', 'study', 'one', 'man', 'internal', 'external', 'struggle', 'war', 'never', 'characterization', 'real', 'human', 'struggles', 'views.Anyway', 'great', 'film', 'same', 'level', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Platoon', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'content', 'film', 'definitely', 'fiction', 'should', ""n't"", 'stop', 'seeing', 'great', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'punches', 'right', 'gut', 'very', 'much', 'up', 'very', 'exhausting', 'ultimately', 'uplifting', 'rewarding', 'film', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Whether it's seeing Ron strapped to a bed in the military hospital, being abused by his caretakers, or watching him have sex with a Mexican whore, or confessing to the parents of the man that he killed....time after time I marvelled at how unflinching this film was. I can't think of any other film that has done this over and over with such honesty and intensity.Ron Kovic's story is amazing and Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise both gave their all to do justice to it in this film.  The DVD has a bonus of Bryan Gumbell interviewing the three of them and it is wonderful to see the common commitment that they had to doing this right.This is an important film, not just because of it's anti-war message, which is certainly as important now as it was when it was made, but because it is the story of personal transformation.  Ron Kovic went through bloody hell and came back and triumphed over his wounds.  This is a tale for every human being.  I recommend it highly.And, by the way, I was truly impressed with Tom Cruise!",5,An important film for everyone,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,1536,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'never', 'watched', 'film', 'before', 'now', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'war', 'films', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fond', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'do', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'though', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'shelf', 'library', 'reluctantly', 'checked', 'out.Wow', 'what', 'surprise', 'i', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recount', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'here', 'just', 'want', 'add', 'five', 'star', 'vote', 'others', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'capacity', 'looking', 'deepest', 'most', 'raw', 'emotions', 'showing', 'just', 'are', 'seeing', 'Ron', 'strapped', 'bed', 'military', 'hospital', 'being', 'abused', 'caretakers', 'watching', 'have', 'sex', 'Mexican', 'whore', 'confessing', 'parents', 'man', 'killed', '.time', 'time', 'marvelled', 'how', 'unflinching', 'film', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'film', 'done', 'over', 'such', 'honesty', 'intensity.Ron', 'Kovic', 'story', 'amazing', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'gave', 'do', 'justice', 'film', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'Bryan', 'Gumbell', 'interviewing', 'three', 'wonderful', 'see', 'common', 'commitment', 'had', 'doing', 'right.This', 'important', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'anti-war', 'message', 'certainly', 'important', 'now', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'story', 'personal', 'transformation', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'went', 'bloody', 'hell', 'came', 'back', 'triumphed', 'wounds', 'tale', 'human', 'being', 'recommend', 'highly.And', 'way', 'was', 'truly', 'impressed', 'Tom', 'Cruise']",N/A

56428,A3AC4DYPWTWDH7,0783226764,"""quasar_909""","[10, 15]","&quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; is a metaphor for America's transformation from an idealistic nation to a cynical and fragmented society. And we see this transformation through the eyes of the film's tragic hero, Ron Kovic, who changes from an all-American, gung ho Marine wannabe to a cynical, embittered paralyzed Viet Nam vet.The primary strength of this film is its ability to draw you into Kovic's world. You feel Kovic's sense of bitterness and betrayal when he comes home to find that America is now a hostile and divided nation and that veterans like him are not welcome. If anything, they're scorned for having fought in Viet Nam.Another strength of this film is Oliver Stone's use of foreshadowing. The night before Kovic leaves for boot camp, Kovic runs through a rainstorm to be with his girl at the senior prom. As they dance, Henry Mancini's &quot;Moon River&quot; plays in the background and in watching this scene, one gets a sense of foreboding that this will be the last time Kovic and his girl friend will ever share such an intimate moment.While &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; has its merits, it also has some glaring shortcomings. Namely, it's an uneven film that requires the viewer to &quot;fill in the blanks.&quot; Throughout the film, Stone gives the viewer an overview of Ron Kovic's life and how he changed from an idealistic high school student-athlete to a radical anti-war activist. However, the audience is forced to draw their own conclusions as to how, when and why this change occurred.Stone also plays fast-and-loose with the truth in this film and he seems more intent on making a political statement rather than a biographical docu-drama. As other commentators have pointed out, Kovic never was a demonstrator at the 1972 Republican Convention. While this bit of fiction serves to promote Stone's political views, it's also self-defeating as it undermines the film's credibility.&quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; is something of a revisionist film that also tends to be rather sanctimonious at times. Yet, for all its shortcomings, &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; is a powerful, evocative film that will play with your emotions.",2,&quot;Fourth&quot; Sparkles and Fizzles,987811200,"04 21, 2001",2001,2193,"['quot', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'quot', 'metaphor', 'America', 'transformation', 'idealistic', 'nation', 'cynical', 'fragmented', 'society', 'see', 'transformation', 'eyes', 'film', 'tragic', 'hero', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'who', 'all-American', 'gung', 'ho', 'Marine', 'wannabe', 'cynical', 'embittered', 'paralyzed', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'vet.The', 'primary', 'strength', 'film', 'ability', 'draw', 'Kovic', 'world', 'feel', 'Kovic', 'sense', 'bitterness', 'betrayal', 'when', 'home', 'find', 'America', 'now', 'hostile', 'divided', 'nation', 'veterans', 'are', 'not', 'welcome', 'anything', ""'re"", 'scorned', 'having', 'fought', 'Viet', 'Nam.Another', 'strength', 'film', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'use', 'foreshadowing', 'night', 'Kovic', 'boot', 'camp', 'Kovic', 'rainstorm', 'be', 'girl', 'senior', 'prom', 'dance', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'quot', 'Moon', 'River', 'quot', 'plays', 'background', 'watching', 'scene', 'one', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'Kovic', 'girl', 'friend', 'will', 'ever', 'share', 'such', 'intimate', 'moment.While', 'quot', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'quot', 'merits', 'also', 'glaring', 'shortcomings', 'Namely', 'uneven', 'film', 'viewer', 'quot', 'fill', 'blanks.', 'quot', 'film', 'Stone', 'viewer', 'overview', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'life', 'how', 'changed', 'idealistic', 'high', 'school', 'student-athlete', 'radical', 'anti-war', 'activist', 'However', 'audience', 'forced', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'how', 'when', 'why', 'change', 'occurred.Stone', 'also', 'fast-and-loose', 'truth', 'film', 'more', 'intent', 'making', 'political', 'statement', 'rather', 'biographical', 'docu-drama', 'other', 'commentators', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Kovic', 'never', 'was', 'demonstrator', '1972', 'Republican', 'Convention', 'bit', 'fiction', 'serves', 'promote', 'Stone', 'political', 'views', 'also', 'self-defeating', 'film', 'credibility.', 'quot', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'quot', 'something', 'revisionist', 'film', 'also', 'be', 'rather', 'sanctimonious', 'times', 'shortcomings', 'quot', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'quot', 'powerful', 'evocative', 'film', 'will', 'play', 'emotions']",N/A

Together they achieve a piece de resistance in filmmaking. Cruise's performance is particularly scintillating in the role of crippled war veteran Kovic. Under the aegis of Stone he efficaciously moves through the vicissitudes of Kovic's life and personal ethos. Cruise's style lends itself well to a character that has one enduring passion that does not diminish in intensity, but does change focus (the strength of purpose is just as strong as he explains to his father why he must go to war as when he denounces the conflict to reporters at the Republican convention).As for Stone he adroitly avoids trying to parlay the `period piece' aspect of the film, and instead concentrates on the bitter ironies (a friend gives the recently paralyzed Kovic some trite business advice `you've got to walk before you can run') and adumbrations (a man brags that his family has participated in all that nations wars and will continue to as the camera shows his grandson). And by keeping the actual Vietnam combat footage in perspective with the whole of Kovic's experience he avoids making `Platoon II' (not an easy feat by the way considering that Tom Beringer and Willem Defoe play key roles in the movie, and some other cast members of Stone's previous Vietnam epic sneak in and out of scenes)",4,"A powerful, engaging film",1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1444,"['Ron', 'Kovic', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'form', 'creative', 'triumvirate', 'story', 'source', 'director', 'lead', 'actor', 'respectively', 'moving', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'saga', 'Together', 'achieve', 'piece', 'de', 'resistance', 'filmmaking', 'Cruise', 'performance', 'particularly', 'scintillating', 'role', 'crippled', 'war', 'veteran', 'Kovic', 'aegis', 'Stone', 'efficaciously', 'vicissitudes', 'Kovic', 'life', 'personal', 'ethos', 'Cruise', 'style', 'well', 'character', 'one', 'enduring', 'passion', 'not', 'diminish', 'intensity', 'change', 'focus', 'strength', 'purpose', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'father', 'why', 'must', 'go', 'war', 'when', 'conflict', 'reporters', 'Republican', 'convention', '.As', 'Stone', 'adroitly', 'trying', 'parlay', 'period', 'piece', 'aspect', 'film', 'instead', 'concentrates', 'bitter', 'ironies', 'friend', 'recently', 'paralyzed', 'Kovic', 'trite', 'business', 'advice', ""'ve"", 'got', 'walk', 'can', 'run', 'adumbrations', 'man', 'family', 'participated', 'nations', 'wars', 'will', 'continue', 'camera', 'grandson', 'keeping', 'actual', 'Vietnam', 'combat', 'footage', 'perspective', 'whole', 'Kovic', 'experience', 'making', 'Platoon', 'II', 'not', 'easy', 'feat', 'way', 'considering', 'Tom', 'Beringer', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'play', 'key', 'roles', 'movie', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Stone', 'previous', 'Vietnam', 'epic', 'sneak', 'scenes']",N/A

56436,A1C58YXM2A30CY,0783226764,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[6, 6]","First Impressions:Oliver Stone along with co-writer Ron Kovic created an anti-war movie based on Kovic's autobiography of his experiences in Vietnam, Kovic's idealism degenerating into the cold hard reality and depths of despair, only to rise again in finding his purpose in stopping the war in Vietnam.Though this film was made in 1989, a lot of what was being said (""if you're not for the war, then you're unpatriotic, etc.) was also being said of current war protestors in America's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan 20+ years later.Hot off his film Platoon, Stone creates a character of Kovic (magnificently played by Tom Cruise at the height of his powers as an actor) -- a young, Catholic boy who dreams of battles and guns, fighting a war to be like his dad and other military vets.It's interesting the balance between patriotism and protest -- Stone really takes a sledgehammer view in putting across this point.The Story:Kovic has a demanding mother and a weak father.  Mom demands perfection from him and puts all this glory and demand on him that he could not hope to live up to.  Joining the Marines may be that chance.  Great scene of Kovic running into the senior prom soaking wet from a thunderstorm to see his girl.  How romantic.The romance ends and the war begins.  The atrocities of killing a Vietnamese family that the commander mistakenly thought were soldiers with guns, the echo of the baby crying held in the arms of his dead mother; the accidental death of his Georgian friend, create disillusionment with Kovic and the horrors of war to the point of disgust on the part of the audience.Great Scenes of Pity, Sympathy and Death:I won't rewrite the whole plot here, but there were some important scenes that bear repeating.  The townsfolk welcome him back, but with a hesitancy.  The insincere ""You're looking good!"" is prominent as well as the underlying disgust with Vietnam vets, who came back to a country that was not proud to have them back.As in the Fourth of July parade where the vets were being cheered, the Vietnam vet Kovic was being jeered by protestors of the Vietnamese war.  Ironically, he becomes a protestor himself, as he lives through a few riots, a drunken brawl or two in Mexico, and the rejection of his family and friends, creating a downward spiral of prostitution, alcoholism and despair.One scene where he realizes that he's killed a family and the baby's echoing cries create a haunting memory he never shakes off.  Another, when he visits the family of the soldier he accidentally killed -- the government lying, not saying he died by friendly fire, but that he died ""with distinction""  -- was intense and revealing.Another great scene that really shows Tom Cruise's range is when he confronts the Republican National Convention in 1972.  (Actually I remember watching that on TV -- ""four more years"" indeed!).  The shouting, the struggle -- Stone really creates a monster and a thug out of the police and the government under Nixon.The Bottom Line:A very strong, visceral film where Stone pulls no punches in his political and social commentary against Vietnam and not wanting us to get involved in another Vietnam -- a story of heroism, degradation and honor.  Won 2 Oscars. Another 10 wins & 14 nominations.Perhaps we should air this film in Congress.

Up until starring in this movie, he was always acting as some young hot shot - an attorney, a pool player, a car dealer, it doesn't matter - someone young and arrogant and hot-headed who usually wound up committing himself reluctantly to a greater cause.  Here he begins the movie as an idealistic teenager aspiring to serve his country and winds up totally unravelled, in what is one of his most wild and tortured performances.

56442,AGRR05FH945HR,0783226764,Steven Cain,"[2, 2]","A dark and disturbing movie, but in many ways, Tom's best work yet. Stone's epic quasi anti-war movie quite rightly shows how the Nam Vets were never honoured for the heroes that they truly were - and that includes the 10,000 Army nurses and Red Cross SRAO women.This movie exposes the Government hypocrisy in many ways, yet perhaps the most powerful commentary is on the state of the Vets hospitals. It's hard to say which scenes are the most harrowing - the ultra-graphic scenes in the Surgical Hospital in Nam, in which the staff had to follow strict Triage protocols and decide who would live and who would have to die (for reasons of resources and time) - or the scenes in the Vet hospital with its almost nineteenth century barbarism.Perhaps the most shameful part of the Government's conduct of the War is that Nixon got elected in 68 on the basis of bringing the boys home, yet he waited until December, 1972 to unleash Linebacker II, the only effective and unrestricted strategic bombing campaign of the entire war.Some years ago I read Robert Bly's Iron John, in which he mentioned that even at that time, more Nam Vets had committed suicide since the end of the War than died during the War itself (more than 58,000). Around the same time, I heard a report that about one third of America's homeless were Vietnam Vets.Watching this movie, you can understand how both of these tragedies have unfolded. I am not a pacifist by any means, but movies like this should be required viewing for people who are considering a career in the military. Not to put them off, but to give them a sense of how badly things can go, so that they may go in with their eyes open.Ron Kovic is a man of tremendous strength and integrity, and he is just one of many many thousands of Vets who were never honoured by their country, and who never heard the words ""Welcome home, soldier.""There is still time to honour the Vets.

Travers,"[7, 17]","In 1989 Oliver Stone came out with &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, the true story of Ron Kovic, a gung-ho Marine who is paralyzed in combat in Vietnam. The film is realistic and compelling. Stone is a master and Tom Cruise as Kovic gives one of his best-ever performances, proving him to be a bona fide acting talent. The film depicts the heartbreaking American experience in Vietnam, and the character arc of Kovic is as complete as any ever captured. He returns home, desperate to believe that his sacrifice was in a noble cause, but this is chipped away by the well-known elements of '60s radicalism. The &quot;generation gap&quot; between longhaired youths and crew cut, religious parents is profound. Kovic sinks into the depravity of drugs and alcohol, but battles back to become a &quot;hero&quot; of the anti-war Left. He wheels into the 1972 Republican National Convention, where he tries to tell the clean-cut, well-heeled patriots that they are wrong and he is right. The idea is that they are all warmongers who have not fought, while he is a pacifist because he has. While there is truth to the premise, in choosing to tell this story, Stone establishes Hollywood as the home of solidly liberal ideas. In 1972, Nixon won 49 states over the ant-war McGovern. The idea that all those Americans, subject daily to reports from Peter Arnett and Dan Rather, the bias of Walter Cronkite, and the hate of the New York Times and the Washington Post, chose Nixon because they were bloodthirsty imperialists is just malarkey. Furthermore, Nixon had made 18-year olds eligible to vote. The concept that all of American youth protested in the streets is a myth. The anti-war movement was propped by TV that made pockets of outrage look like a widespread movement. The Silent Majority spoke out in '72. Big time.Stone's depiction is fair in and of itself, but he takes advantage of the power of his medium in creating a mindset that such horrors as Kovic experienced are just part of the &quot;Vietnam experience.&quot; Kovic's life mirrors soldiers going back to the Roman Legion and beyond. The Left has taken Vietnam as one of those core issues and stuck to it, just as they found themselves wedded to Alger Hiss, Bill Clinton and now the losing side of the War on Terrorism. McCarthy was going after genuine Communists, and genuine Communists were trying to enslave South Vietnam. It took some fighting to stop them. Nixon and Kissinger had the best plan available to them at the time, and the public recognized it. Watergate killed them and the Democrats used it to abandon our allies. Millions died because of them. Democrats will have you believe that we &quot;created&quot; the &quot;killing fields.&quot; They have to say things like that, to cling to this nebulous theory, somehow unable to blame the rabid haters and murderers of Communist history, apparently because they are wedded to McCarthyism.

Thou shall not kill women & children, ma. Thou shall not kill women & children. Isn't this what you taught us?"" - Ron Kovic melts down in front of his parents in ""Born On The Fourth Of July""Oliver Stone's powerful film, based on the true story of Vietnam Vet., Ron Kovic, still packs a punch after fourteen years since its Christmas 1989 release and has the best performance that Tom Cruise has given in his entire career. Sadly, the film didn't sweep the Oscars like ""Platoon"" did, and, no, Cruise didn't win that year for Best Actor (that honor went to Morgan Freeman for ""Driving Miss Daisy"". Say it with me people, ""What the *u*k!?!).""Born"" starts out in the late 50's as we meet a young, impressionable Ron Kovic who plays war with his pals in the backyard and has a sweetie named Donna. The film sets up the major characters & Kovic's family and then jumps to his Senior Year in High School, in the early sixties.A visit from the local Marine Recruiter at his high school easily convinces Kovic and some of his buddies to join the Marine Corp., fully aware that they may be the first to head into battle, and the nightmare that would be Vietnam.The film segues to the year 1967 & Kovic's first tragedy trying to come to grips with accidently killing a fellow soldier in the heat of battle & then his commanding officer telling him to, basically, forget what happened. In 1969, his personal hell begins as he is shot twice, one in the heel of his foot and with a second shot to his upper chest, severly damaging his spinal column, Kovic is paralyzed for life from the waist down.With such a severe injury, Ron Kovic is sent home, but just as he has found that war is hell, the road home has its nightmarish twists & turns. Coming to grips with all that has transpired & with the ever changing world around him, Ron Kovic quickly learns its a long road home.This is easily one of Oliver Stone's best films side-by-side with ""Platoon"". While ""Platoon"" gives us the sweaty, gory, backstabbing, hellish nightmare that was the Vietnam War, ""Born On The Fourth Of July"" gives us the other side of the nightmare, the war at home, in its all its unflinching darkside glory.Stone's direction is top-notch. ""Born on the Fourth of July"" is shot with red, white, & blue hues (red for the battle sequences, blue for the tragic scenes and white for the dream sequences). The film doesn't capture the essence of the 60's & 70's, it embraces it (the scenes of Massapequa in the 60's is all Americana while the Massapequa of the 70's seems lost, trying to forget or demonstrate against the war. The town's innocence is truly lost). The Vietnam action sequences are filmed documentary guerrilla style.The cast is absolutely outstanding. Tom Cruise is at the top of his game in this film. Rumor has it, this film destroyed his marriage to Mimi Rogers. Cruise spent a lot of time in the wheelchair, getting all the movements right & preparing for the role, so when filming began everything came second nature to him. Also, keep an out for small roles from Billy Baldwin, Stephen Baldwin, Holly-Marie Combs (T.V.'s ""Charmed""), Vivica A. Fox (she's the hooker in the hospital ward at night), Michael Wincott (""Alien Ressurection"" & ""The Crow""), John McGinnley (""Scrubs"" & ""Platoon"") & Wayne Knight (Newman from ""Seinfeld"" & ""Jurassic Park"").As for this third DVD release for ""Born On The Fourth Of July"", I really wish it was a special edition, but, its not. This version combines the previous two (before this release, you had a choice between the 30 dollar Dolby Digital version, or the 30 dollar DTS version) with Dolby Digital & DTS audio with a commentary track by Oliver Stone. The only special feature is a NBC backstory segment that delves into the network's archives retrieving interviews with Stone, Cruise, & Kovic from the film's press junket in 1989. Its a half-assed affair with, of all people, Bryant Gumble hosting.With ""Born"" ending with Ron Kovic speaking at the National Democratic Convention in 1976 & the film itself being released 13 months before the first Gulf War, it would be interesting to catch up with Kovic & to see his views on the war in Iraq, stem cell research, & how he feels the country is doing. Sadly, ""Universal"" doesn't share these ideas and the DVD presentation sucks. The picture definitely needs to be remastered. The audio is decent with 5.1 surround.""Born On The Fourth Of July"" is like the colors of the American Flag.They don't run.For Truth, Justice, & The American Way.God Bless Our Troops & American Veterans.Above All, God Bless America.",5,"Re-""Born""",1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,4692,"['Church', 'blessed', 'war', 'Communism', 'insidous', 'evil.They-they', 'told', 'go', 'Thou', 'shall', 'not', 'kill', 'women', 'children', 'Thou', 'shall', 'not', 'kill', 'women', 'children', 'ma', 'Thou', 'shall', 'not', 'kill', 'women', 'children', ""n't"", 'what', 'taught', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'melts', 'down', 'front', 'parents', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'powerful', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Vietnam', 'Vet.', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'still', 'punch', 'fourteen', 'years', 'Christmas', '1989', 'release', 'best', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'given', 'entire', 'career', 'Sadly', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'sweep', 'Oscars', 'Platoon', 'did', 'Cruise', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'year', 'Best', 'Actor', 'honor', 'went', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'Say', 'people', 'What', '*u*k', 'Born', 'out', 'late', '50', 'meet', 'young', 'impressionable', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'who', 'war', 'pals', 'backyard', 'sweetie', 'named', 'Donna', 'film', 'up', 'major', 'characters', 'Kovic', 'family', 'then', 'jumps', 'Senior', 'Year', 'High', 'School', 'early', 'sixties.A', 'visit', 'local', 'Marine', 'Recruiter', 'high', 'school', 'easily', 'Kovic', 'buddies', 'join', 'Marine', 'Corp.', 'fully', 'aware', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'head', 'battle', 'nightmare', 'would', 'be', 'Vietnam.The', 'film', 'segues', 'year', '1967', 'Kovic', 'first', 'tragedy', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'accidently', 'killing', 'fellow', 'soldier', 'heat', 'battle', 'then', 'commanding', 'officer', 'telling', 'basically', 'forget', 'what', 'happened', '1969', 'personal', 'hell', 'shot', 'twice', 'one', 'heel', 'foot', 'second', 'shot', 'upper', 'chest', 'severly', 'damaging', 'spinal', 'column', 'Kovic', 'paralyzed', 'life', 'waist', 'down.With', 'severe', 'injury', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'sent', 'home', 'just', 'found', 'war', 'hell', 'road', 'home', 'nightmarish', 'twists', 'turns', 'Coming', 'grips', 'transpired', 'ever', 'changing', 'world', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'quickly', 'long', 'road', 'home.This', 'easily', 'one', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'best', 'films', 'side-by-side', 'Platoon', 'Platoon', 'sweaty', 'gory', 'backstabbing', 'hellish', 'nightmare', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'other', 'side', 'nightmare', 'war', 'home', 'unflinching', 'darkside', 'glory.Stone', 'direction', 'top-notch', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'shot', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'hues', 'red', 'battle', 'sequences', 'blue', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'white', 'dream', 'sequences', 'film', ""n't"", 'capture', 'essence', '60', '70', 'scenes', 'Massapequa', '60', 'Americana', 'Massapequa', '70', 'lost', 'trying', 'forget', 'demonstrate', 'war', 'town', 'innocence', 'truly', 'lost', 'Vietnam', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'filmed', 'documentary', 'guerrilla', 'style.The', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'top', 'game', 'film', 'Rumor', 'film', 'destroyed', 'marriage', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'Cruise', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'wheelchair', 'getting', 'movements', 'right', 'preparing', 'role', 'so', 'when', 'filming', 'began', 'everything', 'came', 'second', 'nature', 'Also', 'keep', 'out', 'small', 'roles', 'Billy', 'Baldwin', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Holly-Marie', 'Combs', 'T.V', 'Charmed', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'hooker', 'hospital', 'ward', 'night', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'Alien', 'Ressurection', 'Crow', 'John', 'McGinnley', 'Scrubs', 'Platoon', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'Newman', 'Seinfeld', 'Jurassic', 'Park', '.As', 'third', 'DVD', 'release', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'really', 'wish', 'was', 'special', 'edition', 'not', 'version', 'previous', 'two', 'release', 'had', 'choice', '30', 'dollar', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'version', '30', 'dollar', 'DTS', 'version', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'DTS', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'NBC', 'backstory', 'segment', 'network', 'archives', 'retrieving', 'interviews', 'Stone', 'Cruise', 'Kovic', 'film', 'press', 'junket', '1989', 'half-assed', 'affair', 'people', 'Bryant', 'Gumble', 'hosting.With', 'Born', 'ending', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'speaking', 'National', 'Democratic', 'Convention', '1976', 'film', 'being', 'released', '13', 'months', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'catch', 'up', 'Kovic', 'see', 'views', 'war', 'Iraq', 'stem', 'cell', 'research', 'how', 'country', 'doing', 'Sadly', 'Universal', ""n't"", 'share', 'ideas', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'sucks', 'picture', 'definitely', 'be', 'remastered', 'audio', 'decent', '5.1', 'surround', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'colors', 'American', 'Flag.They', 'do', ""n't"", 'run.For', 'Truth', 'Justice', 'American', 'Way.God', 'Bless', 'Troops', 'American', 'Veterans.Above', 'All', 'God', 'Bless', 'America']",N/A
56447,A20TJ5P97W5MS1,0783226764,The Inquisitor,"[3, 3]","How powerful is one voice? Born on the Forth of July is a great film that is proving itself to be a classic. This film was directed by Oliver Stone and is arguably his best. This film is based on the autobiographical book titled Born on the Forth of July written by Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic. Tom Cruise plays Kovic, in a performance that earned him his first Academy Award nomination. Oliver Stone (himself a Vietnam veteran) co-wrote the screenplay with Kovic, and also produced and directed the film. There are countless films that have been made about war. This very well could be the best of them all. Born on the Forth of July  is the story of Vietnam Marine soldier that goes to Vietnam to fight for his county and comes home paralyzed. It is said that Kovic was inspired by President John F. Kennedy's ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"" speech. When Kovic comes home he has a different war to fight. The one within himself. Kovic eventually becomes an influential activist in the anti-war movement and was a speaker at the 1976 Democratic National Convention.  Ron Kovic presented Tom Cruise with his Bronze Star medal on the final day of filming Born on the Fourth of July explaining to the actor that he was giving him the award as a gift for his ""courageous portrayal of the true horrors of war."" Time Magazine reported that Oliver Stone said, ""He gave it to Tom for bravery for having gone through this experience in hell as much as any person can without actually having been there."" This is a real film that will test you in many ways. Ultimately the viewer will walk away wiser and more contemplative about the nature of war and government. Born on the Forth of July explains the different levels of patriotism and anti-patriotism and makes a strong argument for both sides. This is a historical motion picture everyone should watch at some point in their life. If this was shown in history classes the world would be a much different place.
