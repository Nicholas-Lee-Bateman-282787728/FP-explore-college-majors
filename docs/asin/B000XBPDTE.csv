1113883,AIMR915K4YCN,B000XBPDTE,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[3, 4]","THE VEIL is a micro-budget zombie-holocaust movie that rises above its limitations. Its epic scale (2 and a half hours in length) allows the ambitious story to unfold in increasingly hellish jolts of panic, death, and doom. The zombie attacks are fierce and unpredictable. The military response is shot in such a way as to involve the viewer in the suffocatingly oppressive onslaught. I love the idea that people can still make movies like this without zillions of dollars for car chases, explosions, or cartoonish CGI. If you enjoy independent horror films, then add THE VEIL to your collection.

Some of the greatest movies of all time were black and white, what difference does it make as long as it's a well made movie.  This is obviously a low budget film, but I have no problem there since they used what they had to the best of their ability.  I love the unpolished, natural atmosphere created here.  I love zombie films and this one had shades of Night Of The Living Dead and almost reminded me of left 4 dead when they are running through the streets at night shooting zeds.  But one thing refreshing here is they actually run out of bullets, guns actually jam, it's way more realistic, the characters don't have unlimited mags that never drain as zombies close in.  Great job guys, make a sequel.",4,Black and White hate??

It's a no-budget horror, experimental it's story telling- (through a sequence of flashbacks)is a very different take, some of the shots were very impressive. Though on the downside some of it seems to have been cropped to fit on the screen, and too pixely in places, but this does not ruin the overall effect or reduce the enjoyment of the film.

1113887,A3VH08IPM7WN65,B000XBPDTE,Kindle Customer,"[2, 5]","I love zombie movies, and I can sit through a low budget one with the best of them. So naturally I thought too many people were being hard on this movie like they were on so many other zombie flicks. However, here is the honest breakdown; It was hard at times to hear what the characters were saying through the bio hazard masks they wore all through the movie.. The movie was filmed in black and white, so there was a lot of dark scenes that were hard to see. The quality was grainy at times, almost like it was filmed on old VHS tape. But perhaps the worst part was the plot.. It starts out with a virus being let loose in a small town. This part of the movie lasts about five minutes.. then suddenly the words pop up, ""THREE DAYS LATER."" And were thrust into the midst of the military clean up guys shooting zombies, then deciding to rest in one of the abandon houses... Then they play cards.. have a few flash backs of what happened before they got in the house, (which we didn't see until the flashbacks.)Then the entire rest of the movie is just scene after scene of these guys running through the streets shooting zombies... OR.. they are holed up in the house at night, some zombies break in and they have to shoot them too. That's all it is folks..no kidding.. SPOILER ALERT PASSED THIS POINT:  The ending of the movie is typical.. one guy survives in the end,makes it to the pick up spot where he is supposed to be picked up by the rest of the military.. and when he gets there, they shoot him. Then we see planes bombing the zombie infested town, and hear radio reports that the virus has spread.... GREAT... with two and half hours of film, they should have concentrated on a story line, not just random shooting scenes over and over again. Some of the zombies were okay, others just looked like plain people.. others were people wearing really cheap rubber masks. I can't disagree with the bad reviews this time.. They were right on the money.",1,???Two and a half hours of what???,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,1956,"['love', 'zombie', 'movies', 'can', 'sit', 'low', 'budget', 'one', 'best', 'naturally', 'thought', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'being', 'hard', 'movie', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'However', 'here', 'honest', 'breakdown', 'was', 'hard', 'times', 'hear', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'saying', 'bio', 'hazard', 'masks', 'wore', 'movie..', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'so', 'was', 'lot', 'dark', 'scenes', 'were', 'hard', 'see', 'quality', 'was', 'grainy', 'times', 'almost', 'was', 'filmed', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'plot..', 'out', 'virus', 'being', 'let', 'loose', 'small', 'town', 'part', 'movie', 'five', 'minutes..', 'then', 'suddenly', 'words', 'pop', 'up', 'THREE', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'were', 'thrust', 'midst', 'military', 'clean', 'up', 'guys', 'shooting', 'zombies', 'then', 'deciding', 'rest', 'one', 'abandon', 'houses', 'Then', 'play', 'cards..', 'have', 'few', 'flash', 'backs', 'what', 'happened', 'got', 'house', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'flashbacks', 'Then', 'entire', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'scene', 'scene', 'guys', 'running', 'streets', 'shooting', 'zombies', 'OR..', 'are', 'holed', 'up', 'house', 'night', 'zombies', 'break', 'have', 'shoot', 'too', 'folks..no', 'kidding..', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'PASSED', 'THIS', 'POINT', 'ending', 'movie', 'typical..', 'one', 'guy', 'end', 'pick', 'up', 'spot', 'where', 'supposed', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'rest', 'military..', 'when', 'there', 'shoot', 'Then', 'see', 'planes', 'bombing', 'zombie', 'infested', 'town', 'hear', 'radio', 'reports', 'virus', 'spread', 'GREAT', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'concentrated', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'just', 'random', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'over', 'again', 'zombies', 'were', 'okay', 'others', 'just', 'looked', 'like', 'plain', 'people..', 'others', 'were', 'people', 'wearing', 'really', 'cheap', 'rubber', 'masks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'bad', 'time..', 'were', 'right', 'money']",The Veil
1113888,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B000XBPDTE,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","""The Veil"" is Australia's official entry into ""worst zombie movie"" and it is a stinker. Filmed almost all in black and white and at night, they saved a lot of money. An airborne virus is let loose in a small town. Some special forces are sent in to kill the infected people who have turned into killing zombies. I would tell you more, but that is basically the bulk of the movie.1) The main characters wore cartridge gas masks ineffective against airborne viruses. They are extremely uncomfortable and you never drink through them.2) Some zombies are fast moving, while others had the gout.3) Most zombies had no make-up. Others wore cheap masks, which looked extremely fake and really having nothing to do with zombies.4) One female (and a zombie at that) in the whole movie. This isn't a prison film.5) Rapid fire machine gun special effects consisted of a strobe light and a guy beating on a bucket to make gun sounds. The lights and sound didn't match up too well. The movie would have been better if they showed a man with a strobe trying to beat a bucket to the rhythm of the light.6.) Big special effect scene was when they ran over a rubber mask filled with mayonnaise that squirted out the eye socket. They showed it twice, must have been the big budget item.7.) The main characters wore masks nearly the whole movie. They were all about the same size, had the same accent, and wore the same clothes. How the heck was I to figure out which one was talking?On top of that it was boring. Guys running around in gas masks shooting guys with rubber masks.

1113889,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B000XBPDTE,Zombob,"[7, 11]","Review time!!1) ACTING: The acting was pretty good for a low / no budget indie. No oscars will be awarded here, but everyone seemed convincing in their roles.2) PRODUCTION: The filming seemed weird to me. I had a lot of scenes that pixilated on me. I tried the dvd on another dvd player and on my computer, and I still had the pixilation issues. The black & white filming helped make the movie seem more desperate & hopeless, more destitute. The blood and gore was plentiful and many different weapons were used to dispose of the zombies.3) THE ZOMBIES: Nothing really new here. The zombies seemed to differ in look and ""speed"" from zombie to zombie.4) THE CAUSE: Man made air virus.5) NUDITY: None.FINAL: Overall, I did enjoy this, as the people behind it are obviously individuals who enjoy the zombie genre. Some new ideas were presented to the viewers. I do wish, though, that there was more money involved, as I felt there were some budgetary restraints that hindered the film. Also, the film clocked in at 2 and a half hours, and I felt that some scenes were drawn out and could have benefited from being shortened. And I won't even mention the art on the dvd case. The company behind the distribution of 'The Veil' was responsible for the artwork. A nice entry into the low / no budget zombie indie.
