It isn't about a Jewish family that was wronged by others during WW2 (although they certainly were).  It is about a Jewish family that wronged others after the war.  The wrong that they perpetrated was simply one of isolating themselves, of setting themselves apart, of closing the door on others, of not saying ""Thank You"".Well, that door is opened 50 years later.

862530,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B00067BBQY,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[24, 28]","I dreaded watching yet another film that would, predictably, open with a pan of rolling Polish countryside, show an elderly peasant, clueless about why he is being filmed, shot in such a way as to make him appear threatening or simply primitive, and hear a indignant voiceover about Poland's ""Dark, shameful secrets."" Then I would squirm as genuine facts were presented in twisted contexts in order to distort history.""Hiding and Seeking"" is not that anti-Polonist film; it is not Marian Marzynski's ""Shtetl,"" it is not Claude Lanzmann's ""Shoah.""The film opens with Menachem Daum, a Jewish American father, playing, for his devout Jewish sons now living in Israel, a recording of a Jewish sermon in which the speaker encourages his hearers to cultivate hostility toward non-Jews.His sons do not take an unambiguous stance against hatred. Rather, one, especially, struggles to justify prejudice.Moments like this are always darkly amusing for me as a woman viewer. Every second of every day, men violate, torture, murder, enslave, and commit even more unspeakable crimes against women, and have done so for thousands of years. I wonder how the younger Mr. Daum would feel if I tried to justify hatred of men to his wife or daughter?I adduce this absurd example merely to highlight: hatred is NEVER moral. Hatred is NEVER justified. Hatred is always a sin and an intellectual failure.Menachem Daum reports that he grew up with the idea of Poles as the ultimate other, utterly beyond redemption.The older Mr. Daum takes his sons to Poland. There he insists on leaving prayers at the site of a lost synagogue. One of his sons, especially, speaks openly of how foolish he finds such behavior. He sees no important Jewish heritage in Poland, the land of the evil other.Mr. Daum points out to his sons that, were it not for Polish Catholics, they would never have come to be. Their grandfather was saved by Polish Catholics during WW II, who hid three Jewish brothers in their barn.The family visits the Polish saviors, some of whom are still alive. Apparently no warning was given to the Polish family. A van just drives up and a bunch of strangers with a camera pour out. These Polish farmers are gracious and hospitable. They have a pointed question, though. Why, after they risked their lives, and perhaps the life of the village (Nazis often committed retaliatory massacres against entire villages), did the Jews they saved never contact them? ""Even just a post card?""It's an awkward moment. How do you thank people who saved your life under such circumstances? You can't. So, you delay writing the letter, and then you feel ashamed, and then you never write it. Or, perhaps they never wrote because they were afraid of being asked for monetary compensation. Or, as one of the sons points out, perhaps the saved Jews delayed because their experience of being hidden was so traumatic for them that they were no longer ""normal."" Or, perhaps they delayed because their saviors were, after all, Poles. The ultimate other.Time passes, and there are new, and deeply moving, developments, which you will see when you watch the film.The scenes in Poland communicate much: the looks of contempt, hostility, and fear on some of the faces of the Daums, and, then, as the story progresses, looks of thoughtful reflection, and then affection and ease.Menachim Daum emerges as a towering figure. He is saintlike in his insistence on the full humanity of all persons, regardless of their religion.In short, I really loved this movie.And ... yet.And yet.Though the film superficially rejects the idea of Poles as others, the film itself treats Poles as others.The Polish, non-Jewish experience during WW II is not mentioned. The millions of non-Jewish Poles killed in random mass executions, deported, tortured, gassed, experimented on, enslaved.The Polish churches, museums, and other cultural artifacts deliberately and methodically destroyed by the Nazis.The fact that Poland was just out from under a lengthy and destructive period of colonization when it was attacked by Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, simultaneously. That after the war, when many Jews were -- horrifically -- murdered by Polish non-Jews, as this film points out, there was a civil war, in which Jews also did kill non-Jewish Poles, and Poles killed Poles, etc.I could go on, but you get the idea.*Nothing* excuses any act of anti-Semitism any Pole has committed against any Jew. All decent Poles are ashamed of, and work to eliminate, such acts, and they do so as part of a proud tradition stretching back centuries. But we can't understand atrocities until we see them in context, and ""Hiding and Seeking"" doesn't even hint at that context.One guesses that the filmmakers, who don't speak Polish, are not even aware of the context.""Hiding and Seeking"" shows Jews as the sole initiators of Polish-Jewish dialogue and reconciliation. This is simply inaccurate. Poles like Wladyslaw Bartoszewski faced prison terms under the Communists for working on better Polish-Jewish relations.Too, Poles are others in this film. The camera never rests on them exclusively.Just one example. One of the rescuers, an elderly woman, now lives her entire life bent double. Why? The movie never asks this terribly simple question, that, if you were curious, at all, about this woman's full humanity, you'd want answered.As the film says, there are some ""good goyim."" But that schema, that insistence on seeing non-Jews as either ""good goyim"" or ""bad goyim,"" that is, as seeing non-Jews exclusively as entities in relation to Jews, and missing something so obvious as a disease that turned a woman's body into a walking pretzel, misses the full humanity of anyone who is not Jewish.",5,Deeply Moving Part of an Ongoing Dialogue,1149120000,"06 1,

862531,A3Q04XXGGED746,B00067BBQY,"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker""","[21, 31]","Without a doubt, this film is much better than the usual anti-Polish films (e. g., Lanzmann's SHOAH, Marzynski's SHTETL) aired previously by PBS (the Public Broadcasting System). While it is gratifying to see, as the film unfolds, a moving away from the demonization of Poles and an appreciation of Polish efforts to rescue Jews, one is nevertheless struck by the depth of Polonophobic sentiment held by some sectors of the Jewish population. It is actually suggested that, if any people are beyond redemption, it is the Poles. Really? I thought that it was the Germans, as embodied by the Nazis, who planned and implemented the Holocaust. Polish contributions to the Holocaust, Jedwabne and the like notwithstanding, were negligible. Whatever wrong Poles did to Jews was trivial compared to what the Germans did to the Jews. One is therefore mystified as to why Jewish anger towards past wrongs continues to be strongly displaced from Germans unto Poles. Is it political?There is also a veiled anti-Christian reference in the film when it is mentioned that Jews had been persecuted by ""others"" for 1,900 years. In actuality, Jews had been persecuted long before that. Remember the attempted genocide of Jews at the time of Queen Esther, centuries before Christianity?While an elderly hunch-backed Polish woman is shown as a rescuer of Jews, it is not mentioned that more Poles are honored at Yad Vashem for the rescue of Jews than members of any other nationality. And no attempt is made by the film to gauge the numbers of Poles who aided Jews but who were never honored at Yad Vashem.  The film correctly notes that there was a death penalty imposed on Poles by the Germans for any aid given to Jews. But no mention is made of the fact that sometimes entire Polish villages were destroyed by the Germans in reprisal for a single family's assistance to Jews. The suspicion shown by the Polish neighbor towards the Polish woman who was in the act of aiding the Jews thus finds ready explanation. He probably was not thrilled at the prospect of losing his life along with the rescuers of Jews if the Germans found them, which they almost did.The film shows the desecration of the old Jewish cemetery without any contextualization, and the uninformed viewer is led to believe that it was an anti-Jewish act. But was it?  In fact, it was common for the Communist authorities (which, BTW, the Poles had never chosen in legitimate elections) to convert unused cemeteries into such things as garbage dumps, and to allow neglect and vandalism to take its toll.  That happened to not only the Jewish cemetery shown in the film, but also to Polish ones found on the territories seized by the Soviet Union, notably the Lyczakow Cemetery in Lwow (Lviv, Lvov). The film also has a scene of human bones sticking out of walls of what had once been the Jewish cemetery. The obvious implication is that the local Poles had dug out parts of the Jewish cemetery. Did they? It is more likely that the Communist mismanagement of the lands, common throughout the Soviet empire, had caused an acceleration of natural erosion, thus unearthing the cemetery.For all its advances over previous treatments of Poles and Jews, the film remains firmly within the Judeocentric (Judaeocentric) paradigm of Holocaust materials. There is not so much as a hint of the privations suffered by the Poles in the hands of the Germans: The hundreds of burned Polish villages, the 2-3 million murdered Poles (including roughly half of the entire Polish intelligentsia), the systematic destruction of objects of Polish culture, the planned eventual extermination of much of the Slavic peoples, etc. The growing interest in Polish Jews by increasing segments of the Polish society, as shown by this film, calls for some reciprocity from the Jewish side. Perhaps one day educational materials used in the US will portray the deaths of millions of Jews, Poles, Belorussians, and Ukrainians with equal attention to all the victimized nationalities that had lost millions of citizens to the murderous Nazi German death machine. THAT would be the real breakthrough in Polish-Jewish relations.",4,"Some Progress in Polish-Jewish Relations, But...",1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,4144,"['doubt', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'usual', 'anti-Polish', 'films', 'e.', 'g.', 'Lanzmann', 'SHOAH', 'Marzynski', 'SHTETL', 'aired', 'previously', 'PBS', 'Public', 'Broadcasting', 'System', 'gratifying', 'see', 'film', 'unfolds', 'moving', 'away', 'demonization', 'Poles', 'appreciation', 'Polish', 'efforts', 'rescue', 'Jews', 'one', 'nevertheless', 'struck', 'depth', 'Polonophobic', 'sentiment', 'held', 'sectors', 'Jewish', 'population', 'actually', 'suggested', 'people', 'are', 'redemption', 'Poles', 'Really', 'thought', 'was', 'Germans', 'embodied', 'Nazis', 'who', 'planned', 'implemented', 'Holocaust', 'Polish', 'contributions', 'Holocaust', 'Jedwabne', 'like', 'notwithstanding', 'were', 'negligible', 'wrong', 'Poles', 'did', 'Jews', 'was', 'trivial', 'compared', 'what', 'Germans', 'did', 'Jews', 'One', 'therefore', 'mystified', 'why', 'Jewish', 'anger', 'towards', 'wrongs', 'be', 'strongly', 'displaced', 'Germans', 'unto', 'Poles', 'political', 'also', 'veiled', 'anti-Christian', 'reference', 'film', 'when', 'mentioned', 'Jews', 'had', 'been', 'persecuted', 'others', '1,900', 'years', 'actuality', 'Jews', 'had', 'been', 'persecuted', 'long', 'Remember', 'attempted', 'genocide', 'Jews', 'time', 'Queen', 'Esther', 'centuries', 'Christianity', 'elderly', 'hunch-backed', 'Polish', 'woman', 'shown', 'rescuer', 'Jews', 'not', 'mentioned', 'more', 'Poles', 'are', 'honored', 'Yad', 'Vashem', 'rescue', 'Jews', 'members', 'other', 'nationality', 'attempt', 'made', 'film', 'gauge', 'numbers', 'Poles', 'who', 'aided', 'Jews', 'who', 'were', 'never', 'honored', 'Yad', 'Vashem', 'film', 'correctly', 'was', 'death', 'penalty', 'imposed', 'Poles', 'Germans', 'aid', 'given', 'Jews', 'mention', 'made', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'entire', 'Polish', 'villages', 'were', 'destroyed', 'Germans', 'reprisal', 'single', 'family', 'assistance', 'Jews', 'suspicion', 'shown', 'Polish', 'neighbor', 'Polish', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'act', 'aiding', 'Jews', 'thus', 'ready', 'explanation', 'probably', 'was', 'not', 'thrilled', 'prospect', 'losing', 'life', 'rescuers', 'Jews', 'Germans', 'found', 'almost', 'did.The', 'film', 'desecration', 'old', 'Jewish', 'cemetery', 'contextualization', 'uninformed', 'viewer', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'anti-Jewish', 'act', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'common', 'Communist', 'authorities', 'BTW', 'Poles', 'had', 'never', 'chosen', 'legitimate', 'elections', 'convert', 'unused', 'cemeteries', 'such', 'things', 'garbage', 'dumps', 'allow', 'neglect', 'vandalism', 'take', 'toll', 'happened', 'not', 'only', 'Jewish', 'cemetery', 'shown', 'film', 'also', 'Polish', 'ones', 'found', 'territories', 'seized', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'notably', 'Lyczakow', 'Cemetery', 'Lwow', 'Lviv', 'Lvov', 'film', 'also', 'scene', 'human', 'bones', 'sticking', 'walls', 'what', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'Jewish', 'cemetery', 'obvious', 'implication', 'local', 'Poles', 'had', 'dug', 'out', 'parts', 'Jewish', 'cemetery', 'Did', 'more', 'likely', 'Communist', 'mismanagement', 'lands', 'common', 'Soviet', 'empire', 'had', 'caused', 'acceleration', 'natural', 'erosion', 'thus', 'unearthing', 'cemetery.For', 'advances', 'previous', 'treatments', 'Poles', 'Jews', 'film', 'firmly', 'Judeocentric', 'Judaeocentric', 'paradigm', 'Holocaust', 'materials', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'hint', 'privations', 'suffered', 'Poles', 'hands', 'Germans', 'hundreds', 'burned', 'Polish', 'villages', '2-3', 'million', 'murdered', 'Poles', 'including', 'roughly', 'half', 'entire', 'Polish', 'intelligentsia', 'systematic', 'destruction', 'objects', 'Polish', 'culture', 'planned', 'eventual', 'extermination', 'much', 'Slavic', 'peoples', 'etc', 'growing', 'interest', 'Polish', 'Jews', 'increasing', 'segments', 'Polish', 'society', 'shown', 'film', 'reciprocity', 'Jewish', 'side', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'educational', 'materials', 'used', 'US', 'will', 'portray', 'deaths', 'millions', 'Jews', 'Poles', 'Belorussians', 'Ukrainians', 'equal', 'attention', 'victimized', 'nationalities', 'had', 'lost', 'millions', 'citizens', 'murderous', 'Nazi', 'German', 'death', 'machine', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'breakthrough', 'Polish-Jewish', 'relations']",N/A

To prove to them that there are good gentiles in the world, he takes them and his wife on a trip to Poland to have them meet the people who risked their lives by hiding the boys' maternal grandfather and two uncles from the Nazis during World War II.  In fact, the boys and their mother owe their very existence to the extraordinary compassion and heroism of this ""goyim"" family.  Although Daum was raised to see virtually all non-Jews as enemies, his life experience has taught him that people are people and that good and evil do not break down along sectarian lines.  It is this humanistic philosophy that Daum hopes to impart to his sons.The ""hiding"" of the title - beyond the obvious reference to the secretion of Jews during the holocaust - denotes what the practitioners of all religions do when they see themselves as somehow separate from and superior to those around them, and, as a result, build up barriers between their own kind and the outside world.  This attitude creates divisions that, paradoxically, end up destroying the very people they are designed to protect.  The ""seeking"" comes in Daum's epic quest to prove to his children that all people have the potential for goodness if only they choose to act upon it.  Daum's egalitarian spirit and implicit faith in human goodness - despite having himself grown up in the shadow of the holocaust - provide the inspirational beacon than shines forth from the film.Near the end of the movie, the Daums finally get to meet two of the people who risked their lives to save the family`s relatives.  The encounter is profoundly moving and compelling, and even Daum's sons seem transformed by the experience.  But are they?  ""Hiding and Seeking"" may be a ""feel good"" experience, but it isn't a fairy tale, and directors Baum and Oren Rudavsky are not afraid to end on an ambiguous note.  Life, we are led to believe, asks a heck of a lot more complicated questions than an 84-minute movie - even a very good 84-minute movie - can answer.  Not bad for a film in what is usually a know-it-all genre.Filled with laughter and tears as well as a profound insight into the human condition, ""Hiding and Seeking"" is a rewarding and enlightening film.",4,inspiring documentary,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,2539,"['powerful', 'moving', 'documentary', 'Hiding', 'Seeking', 'heart', 'what', 'religion', 'faith', 'are', 'really', 'about.Menachem', 'Daum', 'orthodox', 'Jew', 'concerned', 'two', 'even', 'more', 'conservative', 'sons', 'yeshiva', 'students', 'living', 'Israel', 'are', 'becoming', 'isolationist', 'attitudes', 'gentile', 'world', 'prove', 'are', 'good', 'gentiles', 'world', 'wife', 'trip', 'Poland', 'have', 'meet', 'people', 'who', 'risked', 'lives', 'hiding', 'boys', 'maternal', 'grandfather', 'two', 'uncles', 'Nazis', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'fact', 'boys', 'mother', 'owe', 'very', 'existence', 'extraordinary', 'compassion', 'heroism', 'goyim', 'family', 'Daum', 'was', 'raised', 'see', 'virtually', 'non-Jews', 'enemies', 'life', 'experience', 'taught', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'good', 'evil', 'do', 'not', 'break', 'down', 'along', 'sectarian', 'lines', 'humanistic', 'philosophy', 'Daum', 'impart', 'sons.The', 'hiding', 'title', 'obvious', 'reference', 'secretion', 'Jews', 'holocaust', 'what', 'practitioners', 'religions', 'do', 'when', 'see', 'somehow', 'separate', 'superior', 'result', 'build', 'up', 'barriers', 'own', 'kind', 'outside', 'world', 'attitude', 'divisions', 'paradoxically', 'end', 'up', 'destroying', 'very', 'people', 'are', 'designed', 'protect', 'seeking', 'Daum', 'epic', 'quest', 'prove', 'children', 'people', 'have', 'potential', 'goodness', 'only', 'choose', 'act', 'Daum', 'egalitarian', 'spirit', 'implicit', 'faith', 'human', 'goodness', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'shadow', 'holocaust', 'provide', 'inspirational', 'beacon', 'shines', 'forth', 'film.Near', 'end', 'movie', 'Daums', 'finally', 'get', 'meet', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'risked', 'lives', 'save', 'family', 's', 'relatives', 'encounter', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'compelling', 'even', 'Daum', 'sons', 'seem', 'transformed', 'experience', 'are', 'Hiding', 'Seeking', 'may', 'be', 'feel', 'good', 'experience', ""n't"", 'fairy', 'tale', 'directors', 'Baum', 'Oren', 'Rudavsky', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'end', 'ambiguous', 'note', 'Life', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'heck', 'lot', 'more', 'complicated', 'questions', '84-minute', 'movie', 'even', 'very', 'good', '84-minute', 'movie', 'can', 'answer', 'Not', 'bad', 'film', 'what', 'usually', 'know-it-all', 'genre.Filled', 'laughter', 'tears', 'as', 'well', 'profound', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'Hiding', 'Seeking', 'rewarding', 'enlightening', 'film']",N/A

Menachem Daum (who made this documentary) is a child of Polish Holocaust survivors, and a devout Orthodox Jew residing in Brooklyn, N.Y. His two sons have moved to Israel where they are full-time Yeshiva students. When Daum's wife Rifka comes home one night after attending a lecture where the rabbi preaches hatred of the Goyims (or Gentiles) because of the thousands of years of suffering endured by the Jews at Gentile hands, Daum decides to get a tape of the lecture and goes to Israel. He plays the tape and asks his two sons what they think of the lecture - their response troubles him because although they decry the lecture as being rather extreme, they don't really completely disagree with it either. They both feel comfortable not being in touch with Gentiles as they feel their way of life, completely surrounded by the Jewish way of life, best meets their spiritual and other needs. Daum does not feel comfortable with this, as his own philosophy is quite different - as he says, ""The goal of all religion is to bring us to a level where we can see the divinity that's all around us.""Though Daum is glad that his children and grandchildren are being raised in his father's traditions, he is also worried that they inherit his father's beliefs, that ""the only good goy (gentile) is a dead one."" In his attempts to widen his children's worldview, Daum undertakes a family trip to Poland, where he undertakes to find the Gentile family that was responsible for saving his wife's father and two brothers, a trip fraught with bittersweet memories and some insightful revelations.The documentary is quite well-filmed and I liked how everything falls into place even though it moves between Brooklyn, Israel and Poland. The actual interviews with Daum's family members (his father-in-law, sons, wife, etc.) as well as interviews with the Polish people are interspersed with actual archival footage of historical events during the Holocaust. There are some truly sad moments in this documentary - as when the Daum family visit an abandoned and destroyed synagogue in the the little Polish town where Rivka's family used to live (though it's not mentioned whether it was the result of the Nazis destroying it or the communists). There are no longer any Jews living in this Polish town, but interestingly, a Polish Gentile graduate student (researching the history of the Jews in the town) helps them find the old Jewish cemetery (which has been almost obliterated), and they finally find the Polish couple who sheltered Rivka's father and his two brothers for two years (1943-1945) during the Holocaust.It was interesting to see how Daum's two sons come to appreciate that there are good Gentiles in the world, though the ending of the documentary gives one the impression that they aren't totally convinced (there's an element of ambiguity). I wished there had been more discussion about the Polish couple and their family - the penalty for sheltering Jews during the war was almost certain death, and this couple, just simple farmers in the countryside, took great risks to hide these Jews and never heard from them after the war. I wished there was more dialogue on that aspect - and a more in-depth exploration as to their motives, and how the Polish family got through the war and rebuilt their lives after the war. This would have made it more balanced in my opinion. On the whole though - this is an insightful documentary on rapprochement between people of different faiths and cultures and quite well-done.",4,Insightful and thought-provoking,1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,3733,"['was', 'title', 'documentary', 'caught', 'attention', 'Hiding', 'Seeking', 'Faith', 'Tolerance', 'Holocaust', 'made', 'wonder', 'what', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'words', 'hiding', 'seeking', 'were', 'Menachem', 'Daum', 'who', 'made', 'documentary', 'child', 'Polish', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'devout', 'Orthodox', 'Jew', 'residing', 'Brooklyn', 'N.Y.', 'two', 'sons', 'have', 'moved', 'Israel', 'where', 'are', 'full-time', 'Yeshiva', 'students', 'When', 'Daum', 'wife', 'Rifka', 'home', 'one', 'night', 'attending', 'lecture', 'where', 'rabbi', 'preaches', 'hatred', 'Goyims', 'Gentiles', 'thousands', 'years', 'suffering', 'endured', 'Jews', 'Gentile', 'hands', 'Daum', 'get', 'tape', 'lecture', 'Israel', 'tape', 'two', 'sons', 'what', 'think', 'lecture', 'response', 'decry', 'lecture', 'being', 'rather', 'extreme', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'completely', 'disagree', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'not', 'being', 'touch', 'Gentiles', 'feel', 'way', 'life', 'completely', 'surrounded', 'Jewish', 'way', 'life', 'best', 'meets', 'spiritual', 'other', 'needs', 'Daum', 'not', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'own', 'philosophy', 'quite', 'different', 'goal', 'religion', 'bring', 'level', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'divinity', 'Daum', 'glad', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'are', 'being', 'raised', 'father', 'traditions', 'also', 'worried', 'inherit', 'father', 'beliefs', 'only', 'good', 'goy', 'gentile', 'dead', 'one', 'attempts', 'widen', 'children', 'worldview', 'Daum', 'family', 'trip', 'Poland', 'where', 'find', 'Gentile', 'family', 'was', 'responsible', 'saving', 'wife', 'father', 'two', 'brothers', 'trip', 'fraught', 'bittersweet', 'memories', 'insightful', 'revelations.The', 'documentary', 'quite', 'well-filmed', 'liked', 'how', 'everything', 'place', 'even', 'Brooklyn', 'Israel', 'Poland', 'actual', 'interviews', 'Daum', 'family', 'members', 'father-in-law', 'sons', 'wife', 'etc', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'Polish', 'people', 'are', 'interspersed', 'actual', 'archival', 'footage', 'historical', 'events', 'Holocaust', 'are', 'truly', 'sad', 'moments', 'documentary', 'when', 'Daum', 'family', 'visit', 'abandoned', 'destroyed', 'synagogue', 'little', 'Polish', 'town', 'where', 'Rivka', 'family', 'used', 'live', 'not', 'mentioned', 'was', 'result', 'Nazis', 'destroying', 'communists', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'Jews', 'living', 'Polish', 'town', 'interestingly', 'Polish', 'Gentile', 'graduate', 'student', 'researching', 'history', 'Jews', 'town', 'find', 'old', 'Jewish', 'cemetery', 'been', 'almost', 'obliterated', 'finally', 'find', 'Polish', 'couple', 'who', 'sheltered', 'Rivka', 'father', 'two', 'brothers', 'two', 'years', '1943-1945', 'Holocaust.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Daum', 'two', 'sons', 'come', 'appreciate', 'are', 'good', 'Gentiles', 'world', 'ending', 'documentary', 'one', 'impression', 'are', ""n't"", 'totally', 'convinced', 'element', 'ambiguity', 'wished', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'discussion', 'Polish', 'couple', 'family', 'penalty', 'sheltering', 'Jews', 'war', 'was', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'couple', 'just', 'simple', 'farmers', 'countryside', 'took', 'great', 'risks', 'hide', 'Jews', 'never', 'heard', 'war', 'wished', 'was', 'more', 'dialogue', 'aspect', 'more', 'in-depth', 'exploration', 'motives', 'how', 'Polish', 'family', 'got', 'war', 'rebuilt', 'lives', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'balanced', 'opinion', 'whole', 'insightful', 'documentary', 'rapprochement', 'people', 'different', 'faiths', 'cultures', 'quite', 'well-done']",N/A
