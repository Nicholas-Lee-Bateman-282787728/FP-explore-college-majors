517624,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00003CWLN,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","In some ways, this movie is a real masterpiece. One of its really strong merits is that it does not try to pretend that a single mother (Sarandon) and her daughter (Portman) are so perfect. It shows that people can be loving and endearing even though they aren't perfect.Right away we see that there is tension between Sarandon (who really isn't through living for herself) and her daughter Portman who thinks a little more about what she does. Though she can be a brat sometimes. (One moment is when in a restaurant, she orders more than she knows her mother can afford.)Throughout the story, we are inclined to think that Sarandon should not have had a child. One tragic flaw is that when one of them is ready to open up, the other isn't. Sometime Sarandon isn't ready, and sometimes Portman isn't. (Tragic timing) Portman desperately tries to tell her mother to stop chasing a man who isn't interested in her anymore. (After one ""night,"" he lost interest.)In one really sad moment, we see Portman auditioning for a role, and she accidentally shows her mother the kind of person she is. But despite Sarandon's faults, we can see that Sarandon is heroic in that she did not abandon her daughter. In an especially tragic moment, we see that Portman's father has no interest in her. So, we must at least grant that Sarandon had some sense of responsibility.In his brief role, the kind policeman is memorable. In his 2 scenes he helps both Sarandon and Portman. It is interesting that despite Portman's rebellious (sometimes understandable) attitude  towards her mother, she is not ready to leave until they are at peace with each other.While some PC movies try to always say 'mother knows best,' this movie shows that true love comes from knowing the flaws of each other and still being able to reach each other.",5,"Flawed, But Very Endearing Characters",1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,1811,"['ways', 'movie', 'real', 'masterpiece', 'One', 'really', 'strong', 'merits', 'not', 'try', 'pretend', 'single', 'mother', 'Sarandon', 'daughter', 'Portman', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'loving', 'endearing', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect.Right', 'away', 'see', 'tension', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'living', 'herself', 'daughter', 'Portman', 'who', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'brat', 'sometimes', 'One', 'moment', 'when', 'restaurant', 'orders', 'more', 'mother', 'can', 'afford', 'story', 'are', 'inclined', 'think', 'Sarandon', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'child', 'One', 'tragic', 'flaw', 'when', 'one', 'ready', 'open', 'up', 'other', ""n't"", 'Sometime', 'Sarandon', ""n't"", 'ready', 'sometimes', 'Portman', ""n't"", 'Tragic', 'timing', 'Portman', 'desperately', 'tell', 'mother', 'stop', 'chasing', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'interested', 'anymore', 'one', 'night', 'lost', 'interest', 'one', 'really', 'sad', 'moment', 'see', 'Portman', 'auditioning', 'role', 'accidentally', 'kind', 'person', 'Sarandon', 'faults', 'can', 'see', 'Sarandon', 'heroic', 'did', 'not', 'abandon', 'daughter', 'especially', 'tragic', 'moment', 'see', 'Portman', 'father', 'interest', 'So', 'must', 'least', 'grant', 'Sarandon', 'had', 'sense', 'responsibility.In', 'brief', 'role', 'kind', 'policeman', 'memorable', '2', 'scenes', 'Sarandon', 'Portman', 'interesting', 'Portman', 'rebellious', 'sometimes', 'understandable', 'attitude', 'mother', 'not', 'ready', 'leave', 'are', 'peace', 'other.While', 'PC', 'movies', 'try', 'always', 'say', 'best', 'movie', 'true', 'love', 'knowing', 'flaws', 'other', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'reach', 'other']",N/A

517630,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00003CWLN,Dennis Littrell,"[10, 11]","The mother-daughter bond, especially with an only child, is one of the strongest human bonds there is.  Some say it's stronger than husband and wife.  It tends to be intense and it almost always develops into a situation where neither side has the clear upper hand because both are vulnerable.And they fight.  Tooth and nail.  And they love each other intensely.  For the mother it is scary because everything is in the daughter and for the daughter, especially when the mother is divorced or single, as is the case here.  For the daughter it can be a nightmare because the mother is the adult and has the power and is a total embarrassment.  This is especially true when the mother is delusional or dysfunctional as is Adele August (Susan Sarandon).The story from Mona Simpson's novel is familiar in plot and theme although the details here are unique and especially well done.  Adele's judgment is more than suspect and she's careless with other people's feelings, and she's shallow and dresses funny.  And she isn't completely aware of, nor has she sufficient respect for the needs and wants of her daughter, Ann (Natalie Portman).  She, the mother, wants to leave behind the small town, Midwestern existence and embrace Hollywood and all things glamorous.  Ann would rather stay in Bay City, Wisconsin with her friends and family.  Mom buys a Mercedes and forces Ann to go with her to make a new life in Beverly Hills.I thought Wayne Wang's direction was excellent.  He used visual clues to introduce the scenes: shots of an still apartment, shots of part of a person, shots of the beach or the highway, etc., and then a focus on--almost always--Sarandon or Portman.  And then at sometime, the camera backs away and we see the larger scene: the desert sand and scrub, the ocean and the sunrise, the other diners at the restaurant, the mourners at the funeral, the crossway over the freeway, and so on.  The scene in which Adele is hiding under the covers from heartbreak, and Ann pulls them off, is shot from above because such an angle so beautifully reveals Adele's limbs pulled in close to her body as though in catatonia or in a return to the safety of the womb.  Sometimes the sounds precede the shot as when Adele is in Bay City trying desperately to get in touch with the dentist in California who doesn't want her, and we hear her desperation before we see it in her face.I also liked the way the film was cut.  As soon as the point of the scene was made, we moved on to another scene, which is again introduced visually with just the right kind of lighting, giving us a moment or two to imagine what transpired in-between.  However the real strength of the film is in the brilliant work by Sarandon and Portman.Sarandon is deliberately annoying, flighty, self-delusive, and deeply vulnerable while Portman is powerful, sensitive, and one step ahead of us.  Indeed Natalie Portman is one of the most gifted young talents in all of cinema.  She absolutely commands the camera, and, as it stays on her face, she reveals to us a full set of emotions and responses, layered like things very deep.  If she wants to she can become one of the great stars of the screen.  She has the talent.  I understand however that she is pursuing a career as a doctor.  Whatever she does, one has the sense that she will do it very well.A couple of irreverent questions for director Wayne Wang:How did Ann's audition go?  Did her projection of her mother's personality win her the part?And, what is it that the man does in bed only with a woman he feels special about?  Inquiring minds want to know (rather than make stupid guesses).Anywhere But Here can be compared with some other dysfunctional mom and wise-beyond-her-years daughter films, for example, Mermaids (1990) with Cher and Winona Ryder, Postcards from the Edge (1990) with Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep, Mommie Dearest (1981) with Fay Dunaway and Diana Scarwid, Terms of Endearment (1983) with Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger, and some others I have forgotten.For the record I would rate these in this order:Terms of EndearmentPostcards from the EdgeAnywhere But HereMermaidsMommie DearestAt IMDb they are rated in the same order but with Anywhere But Here at the bottom.  Too bad, but that allows me to say that this is very much an underrated film.See it for both Susan Sarandon, who is as good or even better than she ever was--and that is very good indeed--and for Natalie Portman, who is stunning, and as an actress, mature beyond her years.",5,Brilliant performances by Sarandon and Portman,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,4507,"['mother-daughter', 'bond', 'especially', 'only', 'child', 'one', 'strongest', 'human', 'bonds', 'say', 'stronger', 'husband', 'wife', 'be', 'intense', 'almost', 'always', 'situation', 'where', 'side', 'clear', 'upper', 'hand', 'are', 'fight', 'Tooth', 'nail', 'love', 'other', 'intensely', 'mother', 'scary', 'everything', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'especially', 'when', 'mother', 'divorced', 'single', 'case', 'here', 'daughter', 'can', 'be', 'nightmare', 'mother', 'adult', 'power', 'total', 'embarrassment', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'mother', 'delusional', 'dysfunctional', 'Adele', 'August', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', '.The', 'story', 'Mona', 'Simpson', 'novel', 'familiar', 'plot', 'theme', 'details', 'here', 'are', 'unique', 'especially', 'well', 'done', 'Adele', 'judgment', 'more', 'suspect', 'careless', 'other', 'people', 'feelings', 'shallow', 'funny', ""n't"", 'completely', 'aware', 'sufficient', 'respect', 'needs', 'daughter', 'Ann', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'mother', 'leave', 'small', 'town', 'Midwestern', 'existence', 'embrace', 'Hollywood', 'things', 'glamorous', 'Ann', 'would', 'rather', 'stay', 'Bay', 'City', 'Wisconsin', 'friends', 'family', 'Mom', 'Mercedes', 'forces', 'Ann', 'go', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'Beverly', 'Hills.I', 'thought', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'direction', 'was', 'excellent', 'used', 'visual', 'clues', 'introduce', 'scenes', 'shots', 'still', 'apartment', 'shots', 'part', 'person', 'shots', 'beach', 'highway', 'etc.', 'then', 'focus', 'almost', 'always', 'Sarandon', 'Portman', 'then', 'sometime', 'camera', 'away', 'see', 'larger', 'scene', 'desert', 'sand', 'scrub', 'ocean', 'sunrise', 'other', 'diners', 'restaurant', 'mourners', 'funeral', 'crossway', 'freeway', 'so', 'scene', 'Adele', 'hiding', 'covers', 'heartbreak', 'Ann', 'off', 'shot', 'angle', 'so', 'beautifully', 'Adele', 'limbs', 'pulled', 'close', 'body', 'catatonia', 'return', 'safety', 'womb', 'sounds', 'precede', 'shot', 'when', 'Adele', 'Bay', 'City', 'trying', 'desperately', 'get', 'touch', 'dentist', 'California', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'desperation', 'see', 'face.I', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'cut', 'As', 'soon', 'point', 'scene', 'was', 'made', 'moved', 'scene', 'again', 'introduced', 'visually', 'just', 'right', 'kind', 'lighting', 'giving', 'moment', 'two', 'imagine', 'what', 'transpired', 'in-between', 'However', 'real', 'strength', 'film', 'brilliant', 'work', 'Sarandon', 'Portman.Sarandon', 'deliberately', 'annoying', 'flighty', 'self-delusive', 'deeply', 'vulnerable', 'Portman', 'powerful', 'sensitive', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Indeed', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'young', 'talents', 'cinema', 'absolutely', 'camera', 'face', 'full', 'set', 'emotions', 'responses', 'layered', 'things', 'very', 'deep', 'can', 'become', 'one', 'great', 'stars', 'screen', 'talent', 'understand', 'however', 'pursuing', 'career', 'doctor', 'sense', 'will', 'do', 'very', 'well.A', 'couple', 'irreverent', 'questions', 'director', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'How', 'did', 'Ann', 'audition', 'go', 'Did', 'projection', 'mother', 'personality', 'part', 'what', 'man', 'bed', 'only', 'woman', 'special', 'Inquiring', 'minds', 'want', 'know', 'rather', 'make', 'stupid', 'guesses', '.Anywhere', 'Here', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'dysfunctional', 'mom', 'wise-beyond-her-years', 'daughter', 'films', 'example', 'Mermaids', '1990', 'Cher', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Postcards', 'Edge', '1990', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', '1981', 'Fay', 'Dunaway', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'Terms', 'Endearment', '1983', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'others', 'have', 'forgotten.For', 'record', 'would', 'rate', 'order', 'Terms', 'EndearmentPostcards', 'EdgeAnywhere', 'HereMermaidsMommie', 'DearestAt', 'IMDb', 'are', 'rated', 'same', 'order', 'Anywhere', 'Here', 'bottom', 'Too', 'bad', 'say', 'very', 'much', 'underrated', 'film.See', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'as', 'good', 'even', 'better', 'ever', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'stunning', 'actress', 'mature', 'years']",N/A

Adele August (Susan Sarandon) leaves her home in  Wisconsin and drags her 14 year old daughter (Natalie Portman) to a new  life in the bright lights of Los Angeles.  The problem is it is the same  old hopeless life in a brand new place.There is really no story here,  just a series of situations for mother and daughter to bicker over so we  can be convinced how intense a love-hate relationship they have with one  another.  The characters spent the entire movie trying to confuse us as to  which of them was more immature.This is a classic example of how good  acting cannot save a bad screenplay.  Both Sarandon and Portman did an  outstanding job of playing their characters.  But each of them were playing  characters that were so repellent that there was nowhere to turn for  relief.  Of the two, Portman evoked a sense of pity for poor Ann, who had  to be stuck with such an obnoxious and putrid mother.  Admittedly, I have  to give Sarandon credit for doing such a fine job of making Adele so  distasteful.I rated this film a 3/10, despite fine performances by both  leads.  I just don't feel it is entertaining to spend two hours watching  two puerile characters snipe at one another.  I would only recommend this  movie to women who had bad relationships with their mothers (probably a  large demographic now that I think of it) for the obvious identification  factor.  Perhaps this film will make them feel a little better that they  are not alone in their frustration and anger.

In all likelihood, neither film benefitted, either critically or commercially, from having a similar product on the market at the same time.  Janet McTeer of &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; got the Oscar nomination, as we know, but Susan Sarandon is always worth watching, and director Wayne Wang (&quot;Joy Luck Club,&quot; &quot;Smoke&quot;)has an impressive track record.  &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; may not be a great film, but it is well worth checking out.The film does take some patience.  It is primarily a character study and the characters take a little time to get to know.  At first, daughter Ann seems to be just another sullen teenager.  But gradually, one sees that her super-eccentric mom, Adele, gives her plenty of reason to be surly.Sarandon is spot on as the free-spirited middle-aged dreamer, Adele.  Portman's character lives in her mother's shadow, to a large degree, but her performance is a lot more nuanced than some reviews have indicated.  As a teen, she's entitled to brood, and as Adele's daughter, doubly so.  But it's not just a one-note performance.  The &quot;audition&quot; scene alone should convince any doubter that Portman has more range than she's allowed to show in the rest of the movie.&quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; might have fared better if it had been a little more streamlined.  This is one of those films that you'd instantly recognize as having been based on a novel--even if like me, you had never heard of the novel before.  A lot of secondary characters are introduced (Gail Letterfine, George, most of Adele's family back in Wisconsin)but never fleshed out.  No doubt these characters were more expansively portrayed in the novel, but the film version has you wondering just what was left on the cutting room floor.  The net result is that it's all a bit sketchy.Fans of Sarandon, the up-and-coming Portman or director Wang may well want to add this film to their collection.

517644,A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW,B00003CWLN,John K. Reed,"[1, 3]","This film delves into a number of issues and does a great job at not overemphasizing any one. The director does a credible job of looking at multiple aspects of the relationship from diverse perspectives.What I particularly enjoyed about the film is the examination of the mother's need to direct and control the daughter's interests and perspectives.  A situation that unfortunately is all too prevalent in families around the globe.  Not being a parent myself I firmly believe that the parents role is primarily to set guidelines and general principles for the child to follow that will lend themselves to positive outcomes regardless of the particular situation that the child may find themself.  The parent should offer guidance and suggestion to the child rather than dictating edicts that may not be suited to the child's character or aspirations.  Obviously i'm referring more to older children rather than younger.Although it is apparent that Susan Sarandon's character has her daughter's best interest at heart what she and many other parents like her don't realize is that the child's interests are not necessarily being served by the parents actions.  The parent has a responsibility to the child and not vice versa.However this film adeptly demonstrates that children are often unaware of how much concern, worry, and love that a parent has for a child.  The scene at the airport comes to mind.  It was important for Natalie Portman's character to see how frantic her mother got when she was unable to find her child.I also found it somewhat reprehensible that Susan Sarandon would leave the stable environment that she had albeit an unsatisfying one in lieu of the freewheeling throw caution to the wind adventure that she embarked upon.  She was clearly putting her own desires above that of her daughters best interest.Unfortunately Susan Sarandan's character is all too emblematic of many parents attitudes in contemporary society.  She like too many other real life parents is still immature rather than being an adult.  Sacrifices have to be made especially when someone else who you were responsible for bringing into the world is depending on you for their physical, financial, and emotional well being.  That's part of what being mature means.Although I had (some) sympathy for the mother the angst and uncertainty that the daughter experiences warrants considerable sympathy and supercedes any concerns for the mothers well being.Both actresses are fantastic.  And the film paints a not too pleasant picture of what single parenthood means to all of the participants.

Anywhere But Here stars Susan Sarandon as Adele August and Natalie Portman (fresh from Star Wars The Phantom Menace) as the daughter Ann.Adele is frustrated by the small town life in Bay City, Wisconsin and escapes to Beverly Hills, California, in a second-hand Mercedes accompanied by her very unwilling and pensive daughter. Ann does not want to leave her family and friends behind, and can barely stand her mother, who is flaky, irresponsible and crass, although she means well.Both mother and daughter tries to start a new life in California - finding a place to stay, going to school, finding a job, getting involved with men (willingly and unwillingly). Along the way, they find themselves in a love-hate relationship with each other and gradually realise they need each other even though they find each other frustrating.I think this film has a number of good points and well crafted scenes, but overall I found it a bit slow.

This is a coming of age story which sees Natalie Thompson play the teenage daughter of a loud, flighty, impractical dreamer, wonderfully portrayed by Susan Sarandon.Sarandon is on her second marriage, living in Wisconsin with her teenage daughter. She is bored by her nice, dull, skating instructor, second husband. She is tired of living among her complacent, middle class relatives. She dreams of riches, stardom for her daughter, and a more exciting life. She has dreams, big ones, but really lacks the wherewithal to make them happen.Her daughter is a bit of a mouse, who likes all that Sarandon seems to abhor. She likes Wisconsin, her family, and what she views as relative normalcy. Unlike her mother, she does not feel called upon to explore new horizons. Naturally, given the divergence of their dreams, they inevitably clash, and the daughter, given her youth, must go where her mother decides to wander. Here, it turns out to be Beverly Hills, the land of milk and honey, or so Sarandon thinks.While living on the fringes in Beverly Hills, Sarandon sees that her daughter attends a good school. Yet, they live like vagabonds, moving from apartment to apartment as the rent becomes due and cannot be paid, and the lights are turned off for non-payment of bills. The mother, a holly-go-lightly, wants to live well and meet the exciting man of her dreams who will enable her to live out her fantasy life. She is, at times, desperately pathetic, looking for love in all the wrong places. Her daughter, while responsible and a good student, can be an insufferable little prig who, when the chips are down, however, remains loyal to her errant mother.Their differences in style cause them to clash and misunderstand each other with resultant angst over the years. As time goes on, their life does seem to stabilize. It is not until the daughter is ready for college, however, that Sarandon fully realizes that her dreams are not necessarily those of her daughter. It is then, that they both realize just how much each loves the other, as Sarandon finally steps up to home plate.

If you recall, Cher's character had a slight falling  out with Winona Ryder's character (who plays her daughter).  The daughter  rebels against the mother's odd way of life (I'll never forget the way  Cher's character feeds her family little sandwiches shaped like objects).

Some people found it strange that I, being a guy, would go see a real girl-movie alone, including the man in the ticket-office who looked  really nonplussed and asked me if I really wanted only one ticket.Well,  I did, and I'm glad I did it.Anywhere But Here is, exactly as its poster  says: A movie about a mother who knows best and a daughter who knows  better... And it's good.The story is quite thin: Ann August (Natalie  Portman) is a young girl whose single mother Adele (Susan Sarandon) hasn't  quite lost her youthful lust for adventure. They move from bay City,  Wisconsin to Beverly Hill where Adele hopes to find a better life. But she  forgot to take her daughter's feelings into account...As you might  expect, there are lots of emotional outbreaks in this movie, but it never  becomes too much. Also, it's refreshingly devoid of sentimentalism and  happy-go-lucky lovestories, which makes the story far more believable and  worthwhile.But the main reason for seeing this movie is the divine  acting by both leads. Natalie Portman plays the independent daughter that  is  far more mature than her mother and does an extremely convincing job.  That girl is destined for absolute stardom! And while Sarandon is always  good, this is no doubt one of her best performances ever. Adele is neurotic  and selfish, but still has strength and love for her daughter. A difficult  character to play, but Sarandon makes her come to life, swaying from  borderline insanity to joyous strength and zest for life. Together, they  make one of the best mother/daughter relationships I've ever seen in a  movie come truly alive.All in all, the story is little more than an  excuse for getting two great actresses together. I suspect Wayne Wang knew  this when he directed the movie. But it still works brilliantly.This is  a movie that will warm your heart and thrill you if you care for great  acting.

Ann, played by Natalie Portman, is the daughter of Adele, played by Susan Sarandon.  Adele is domineering, excessively well-intentioned, and charismatic to a fault, believing often in appearances over substance.Ann hates the level of invasive direction that she receives from her mother.  She says to a police officer who is giving her mother a ticket:  ""You don't even understand.  I'm going to leave her one of these days.""Officer:  ""I'm sure you will.  But not today.""Ann:  ""Why not today?""Officer:  ""Well you should leave her when you're calm.  When you're rational.  You leave her when you're ready not to come back.  You understand?""The same officer plays a pivotal role, once early in the film, and once near the end.  The timing of his appearances in the screenplay are not incidental.  The officer is ultimately setting up a social test for the daughter to consider, a test he hopes will deter the daughter from leaving unwarrantedly and not before she exhausts every option she can discover.  And he speaks with conviction and earnest, probably because he has personally seen what harm can come from people leaving each other or talking to each other when they are not calm or rational.Sometimes when I hear daughters complaining about the faults of their mothers, I think, ""That is very bad.  But it's probably not as bad as what your mother had to endure with her mother.""  We live in a ""story rich"" world, where we are exposed to thousands of novels, TV, and movies that can give us relationship examples of how to better relate with each other.  Our parent's parent's generation had far less social education and diverse social modeling to examine and compare.  They had few parenting guides, no internet, and few social examples beyond their own family.Adele discovers that Ann wants to live on the other side of the country.  Ann comes home to find her mother has opened her mail and says, ""You opened it?""  Adele replies, ""Well, how else am I going to know how you're planning your life?

And in the final scene with the officer, she says, ""Did she tell you any of the good things that I did?  Because I did a lot of good things.  She's always had a warm home, food and clothing.  And I got her into the Beverly Hills school system.  Did she tell you that?  You know, she could have been an actress, but instead she's going away to college.  Doesn't she know that I would do anything for her?  I mean, I love her.  She is the reason that I was born.  Doesn't she understand that I would do anything for her?""

Fortunately, the performance of Sarandon and Portman never disappoints you throughout the whole movie.The ending concludes the movie very well:Ann: &quot;Even if you can't stand her (the Mom).  Even if you hate her.  Even if she's ruining your life.  There's something about my mother.  Some romance, some power.  And when she dies, the world will be flat.  Too simple, too fair... Too reasonable.&quot;",3,Sarandon and Portman shines!!!,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,1262,"['Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'are', 'reason', 'buy', 'DVD', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'However', 'script', 'little', 'loose.It', 'Mom', 'Adele', 'who', 'little', 'bit', 'wild', 'crazy', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'daughter', 'planning', 'will', 'simply', 'be', 'best', 'daughter', 'Ann', 'own', 'preferences', 'always', 'escape', 'mom', 'What', 'simple', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'flat', 'unfortunate', 'script', 'not', 'provide', 'chemistry', 'dynamics', '2', 'characters', 'know', 'conflicts', 'sometimes', 'see', 'daughter', 'mom', 'suddenly', 'be-friending', 'Even', 'actress', 'tries', 'hard', 'make', '2', 'believable', 'characters', 'still', 'story', 'certain', 'sparkle', 'make', ""'real"", 'good', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'performance', 'Sarandon', 'Portman', 'never', 'whole', 'movie.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'Ann', 'quot', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Mom', 'Even', 'hate', 'Even', 'ruining', 'life', 'something', 'mother', 'romance', 'power', 'when', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'flat', 'Too', 'simple', 'too', 'fair', 'Too', 'reasonable.', 'quot']",N/A
