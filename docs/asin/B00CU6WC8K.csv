The art is great as is the score and I also thought the english dub was good as well. If I had any complaint, it would be the short 11 episode 1st season. Basically, Shu Oma can pull &#34;Voids&#34; out of people's hearts, each one varies and has different effects. He joins with a group called Funeral Parlor and together they try to stop the organization called GQ, which is wreaking all sorts of havoc. This has a bit of everything for everyone, you have a mix of mecha, romance, comedy, darkness, and sci-fi and action which comes together very well and keeps the audience drawn in.  If you like series like Evangelion, Gundam Wing, or Cowboy Bebop this should be right up your alley.

1651141,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B00CU6WC8K,Coulter Rail,"[3, 5]","""Guilty Crown"" is gorgeous to look at, and has an interesting premise on the surface, but if you walk a bit further you'll quickly realize you're walking down hill.The animation is fluid, and blends CG effects masterfully.  The fights are entertaining but don't hold up well when compared to other anime.  The character's foundations are all reused material and nothing new is added to them.  The music is compelling, but when any significant moment arrives it's replaced with J Pop.All these things can be overlooked if they can keep the storyline together and interesting.  They don't.The main character can pull ""voids"" from other people and each is a unique weapon that's supposed to be a representation of the person whose chest he just pulled it from (giving our hero the excuse to grope our pink-haired-pop star for weapons).  Instead of these tools representing the characters they originate from, they seem to represent the perfect solution to whatever problem currently erks them.  There's no problem solving or intensity.  They don't have to worry because the person standing next to them always has the key.  It's a cool premise that's weakly executed.Having a young, boy hero get his powers from a hot vixen has also been done to death.  So is having every member of his teen social community jovially being tied to the fate of the world.  The lead heroine is a famous pop star and a terrorist but the authorities can't seem to catch her.  The logic of the show is full of holes like this and the storyline never bothers to explain anything resulting in a bland world ""void"" of detail where the audience is expected to follow the self obsessed emotional narrative of the wandering teens while the oppressive adults shake a gloved fist at them.The writers of the show didn't care about their story so neither did I.  It wouldn't bother me so much except I'm reminded of how beautiful the show looks and my thoughts go to the artists and animation teams that worked really hard on something so thin.

To all the people who are being harsh on the show, Funimation ran out of money near the end trying to make the show perfect so they had to shorten it from 28 episodes to 22 episodes. Now here is what the series is about and pardon how choppy the review is because I am trying not to reveal spoilers cause its really hard to explain what its about cause pretty much everything I have to say is spoilersABOUT:This is a series about a teen named Shu who lives in a post apocalyptic world where a virus knows as the Apocalypse Virus is running rampent causing much of Japan to be quarantined while aid is constantly needed. He meets a songstress named Inori who, in a chain of events, unlocks the power of the void (which is where Shu draws out peoples hearts and uses them as weapons) to save the worldMY REVIEW:The series is pretty much Epic. Great Music, Great Story (For their budget), Great everything. I highly recommend this anime. Even though the last part of it leaves a lot to be desired, it wasn't intentional. I still highly recommend it. It has got music by Supercell (Which is the group that helped with Hatsune Miku and Black Rock Shooter) only more awesome, has got romance, action, sy-fi, robots and pretty much everything you need to make a awesome series.",5,Don't be so harsh.
