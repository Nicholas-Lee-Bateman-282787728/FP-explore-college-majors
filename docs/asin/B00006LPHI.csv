721037,A2FQDF8QE9B9BC,B00006LPHI,"H. Detter ""Finally""","[11, 12]","This is not a Hollywood movie and therefore should not be judged by the same standards. In the music industry, you don't compare an album made by a band on a huge record label to an album made by a band on a small label. Therefore, I don't believe it's necessary to do it here. This movie is about three young ladies who are obviously frustrated with men. One of the ladies convinces the other two that the best way to get revenge on men is to get their money. The way they chose to do this is to romance various men with a certain amount of wealth, scope out their houses and belongings then make plans to have someone else break in at a later date. I found the plot to be thin and unoriginal however I enjoyed how the actors portrayed each character. While none of the actors are A-list (or even B-list for that matter), I like their idiosyncrasies. Some of them over act while others don't do enough acting. To me, it makes for an interesting mix. The movie drags on for a certain amount of time without much happening while setting up the fall of the ladies ""scam"". I won't reveal exactly how that happens but let's just say that you reap what you sow. I must say that I didn't enjoy the soft porn aspect of this movie. In my opinion, it was just eye candy and that depends on the set of eyes viewing. But overall, the I did find this movie entertaining. Could I watch it multiple times?

I had seen it in the $5 bargain bin at Wal-Mart several times before, but once she suggested I watch it, I couldn't find it anywhere.  I check for it just about everywhere, to no avail.Several months ago, while looking up other films I came across the title again and looked it up and decided to purchase it, via online.  It arrived in the mail and I placed it with several other dvd's waiting to be viewed.  Somehow or another it ended up, blended in with the rest of my video library (over 600 DVDs), and I just came across it a few weeks ago.Over this past weekend, I had the opportunity to watch the film and enjoyed it.  In spite the fact that it isn't the best quality of material or acting.Not sure why a few others referred to this as porn, because I have seen far worse in other films.  The only deciding factor I can come up with is the fact that the characters are African American and not from the most desired social background.Take the same type of graphic sex scenes, and place them in a ""Hollywood White"" film and all of a sudden, it's acceptable?I enjoy what I consider ""Hollywood White"" films, just as much as the next person, but always try to support the efforts of my people.

Anyway, I notice this movie ""Durty Game"".  The cover had three very sexy black women.  I new from reading the back of the cover that this was an indie (the cover came off as non-hollywood).  The story synopsis wasn't original, but I wanted to watch a movie and it didn't look boring.  So I rented it.  Me and my girlfriend watched this movie right after watching a big special effects Hollywood movie and we enjoyed ""Durty Game"" more!This movie does not have big fancy stunts, gunplay, or special effects.  There are no A-list stars featured either. HOWEVER, the story played out very well and the dialogue between the girls was very entertaining.  And the sex scenes were hot too. The DVD has extended sex scenes in the deleted scenes special feature section for those interested.In short.  The dialogue was funny.  The situations messed up.  And the ending, all I can say is - Karma is a bi**ch!The girls are the reason why I rented this movie.  All though unknown, they are sexy enough to carry a movie, which these three women do very well.  The acting is bad in some parts, mostly during argument scenes.  But not too bad that you can't get into the movie.  If you like hood movies, and this is a ""hood"" movie- sex, drugs, money, cars, women, clubs, guns, etc.. then this is worth the watch.  If you're from the hood, you can definitely relate.  If not...check it out anyway.
