At least when we put it in she didn't hear the familiar Martin Short voice that she expected, got mad and wouldn't watch. And I am glad she didn't due to some of the subject matter. Some of it is just poor done and some just not for little ones. I wish I hadn't bought it. Take your money and buy one of the Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That series DVD's instead.

""brnn64""","[21, 23]","The Seuss cartoons here are naturally going to provoke outrage from the mamby pamby lovers of Barney and the New Zoo Revue who want all the kids to grow up skipping through daisies holding hands and singing ""We are the world"", but some things to consider.The Horton cartoon is from the Looney Tunes folks, albeit in a rough Seussian style. I saw it myself as a child and was not traumatized by the fish shooting itself (NOTE-The fish isn't actually shown doing this act, he goes offscreen with a gun and it is implied), having seen similar scenes in other cartoons at the time (relax folks, your kids are stronger than you think-Tom and Jerry didn't turn anyone into axe-murderers and no one today is complaining about the equally gross antics of Itchy and Scratchy). If anything, the bird's callousness toward Horton and her egg concerned me more than anyhting else as while watching this as a kid.Daisy head maysie, to me, is essentially a Seuss rewrite of The underground classic ""Boy With Green Hair,"" although her character seems a bit more self-assured.Likewise, the Butter Battle book is straight out of Jonathan Swift's fable about the people going to war over how to break eggs, although its considered to be a cold war fable.Yeah, Suess sometimes actually wrote for adults.",4,Remember that Seuss sometimes wrote for adults,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,1283,"['Seuss', 'cartoons', 'here', 'are', 'naturally', 'going', 'provoke', 'outrage', 'mamby', 'pamby', 'lovers', 'Barney', 'New', 'Zoo', 'Revue', 'who', 'want', 'kids', 'grow', 'up', 'skipping', 'daisies', 'holding', 'hands', 'singing', 'are', 'world', 'things', 'consider.The', 'Horton', 'cartoon', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'folks', 'albeit', 'rough', 'Seussian', 'style', 'saw', 'child', 'was', 'not', 'traumatized', 'fish', 'shooting', 'NOTE-The', 'fish', ""n't"", 'actually', 'shown', 'doing', 'act', 'offscreen', 'gun', 'implied', 'having', 'seen', 'similar', 'scenes', 'other', 'cartoons', 'time', 'relax', 'folks', 'kids', 'are', 'stronger', 'think-Tom', 'Jerry', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'anyone', 'axe-murderers', 'one', 'today', 'complaining', 'equally', 'gross', 'antics', 'Itchy', 'Scratchy', 'anything', 'bird', 'callousness', 'Horton', 'egg', 'concerned', 'more', 'anyhting', 'else', 'watching', 'kid.Daisy', 'head', 'maysie', 'essentially', 'Seuss', 'rewrite', 'underground', 'classic', 'Boy', 'Green', 'Hair', 'character', 'bit', 'more', 'self-assured.Likewise', 'Butter', 'Battle', 'book', 'straight', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'fable', 'people', 'going', 'war', 'how', 'break', 'eggs', 'considered', 'be', 'cold', 'war', 'fable.Yeah', 'Suess', 'sometimes', 'actually', 'wrote', 'adults']",N/A
