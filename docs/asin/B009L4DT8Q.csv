I loved Mitzi Gaynor & thought Dale Robertson was so handsome. When I saw that it was finally available on DVD I couldn't wait to get it. I watched it right away as soon as I got it. It is still good. Yes it may not be historically correct but that isn't why I love it. Mitzi Gaynor's performance is so good, I love her voice & she was such a cute dancer. Dennis Day's voice still gives me chills, such a beautiful tenor. And yes, I still think Dale Robertson was handsome. The story is a bit dated & predictable but still enjoyable & I got tears when she sang Dixie even tho' I knew the end. The quality is better than I thought it would be after some of the comments & the sound is just fine. So give it a try. If you like musicals you might just like this one.

The film not only does not stick to the facts of  her life but deliberately mixes them up ( see the article in Wikpedia ) . There is much enjoyable music from the civil war era which  should please manybut be warned the color print used is not  a restored film element and is far too dark and not very sharp ; never-the-less the movie is very watchable and works up to one of the most dramatic climaxes in all movie musicals . The always entertaining Mitzi is very well supported by the other players , particularly James Barton , a big name on Broadway in his day. Fox is not going to a lot of trouble it seems to make anything like the high quality Made On Demand Discs  we can get from the Warner-MGM or the Sony-Columbia . In fairness I should add their offering of the 1938 Suez is good .",3,For Mitzi Gaynor Fans,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,930,"['movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'life', 'Lotta', 'Crabtree', 'singer-dancer', 'who', 'became', 'wealthiest', 'American', 'performer', 'time', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'stick', 'facts', 'life', 'deliberately', 'mixes', 'up', 'see', 'article', 'Wikpedia', 'much', 'enjoyable', 'music', 'civil', 'war', 'era', 'should', 'please', 'manybut', 'be', 'warned', 'color', 'print', 'used', 'not', 'restored', 'film', 'element', 'far', 'too', 'dark', 'not', 'very', 'sharp', 'never-the-less', 'movie', 'very', 'watchable', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'dramatic', 'climaxes', 'movie', 'musicals', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Mitzi', 'very', 'well', 'supported', 'other', 'players', 'particularly', 'James', 'Barton', 'big', 'name', 'Broadway', 'day', 'Fox', 'not', 'going', 'lot', 'trouble', 'make', 'anything', 'high', 'quality', 'Made', 'Demand', 'Discs', 'can', 'get', 'Warner-MGM', 'Sony-Columbia', 'fairness', 'should', 'add', 'offering', '1938', 'Suez', 'good']",N/A

The supposed life story of the legendary Lotta Crabtree it is worth watching but it is highly historically inaccurate.  For example, in the movie Lotta is 16 when she begins to perform. In reality she was only 6. In the movie her father is a gambler and ex-vaudevillian, he actually owned a bookstore. In the movie she sees Lola Montez for the first time, actually she and her family were friends with Lola and Lotta often played at Lola's home. In the movie she falls in love with Tom Richmond and it is clear they will be married, actually she never married.  There are a lot of good performances so the movie is fun, but inaccurate.",4,Cute but inaccurate movie,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,708,"['like', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'lot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'supposed', 'life', 'story', 'legendary', 'Lotta', 'Crabtree', 'worth', 'watching', 'highly', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'example', 'movie', 'Lotta', '16', 'when', 'perform', 'reality', 'was', 'only', '6', 'movie', 'father', 'gambler', 'ex-vaudevillian', 'actually', 'owned', 'bookstore', 'movie', 'Lola', 'Montez', 'first', 'time', 'actually', 'family', 'were', 'friends', 'Lola', 'Lotta', 'often', 'played', 'Lola', 'home', 'movie', 'love', 'Tom', 'Richmond', 'clear', 'will', 'be', 'married', 'actually', 'never', 'married', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'performances', 'movie', 'fun', 'inaccurate']",N/A
