And yes interviews Taylor herself too! I was very pleased with it. Taylor is such a sweetheart. I actually wish I had bought this sooner! If you're a true fan of Taylor Swift you need this in your collection. Ignore those bad reviews by the look of it they obviously watched a different documentary then this one. Anyways buy it! long live Taylor Swift!,5,Great Documentary,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,467,"['Just', 'great', 'dvd', 'compliment', 'Journey', 'Fearless', 'great', 'interviews', 'music', 'yes', 'interviews', 'Taylor', 'too', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'Taylor', 'such', 'sweetheart', 'actually', 'wish', 'had', 'bought', 'sooner', ""'re"", 'true', 'fan', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'need', 'collection', 'Ignore', 'bad', 'reviews', 'look', 'obviously', 'watched', 'different', 'documentary', 'then', 'one', 'buy', 'long', 'live', 'Taylor', 'Swift']",N/A
1510348,A2CA2Q6JS6CQAE,B0064WDX16,"Michael Harris ""Michael Harris""","[73, 81]","You can find better things to spend your money on. Such as the Taylor Swift, ""Journey To Fearless"" dvd. This dvd is nothing but 61 mins of 5 or 6 people talking about Taylor Swift's life and carrier with less than 5 mins of interview footage of Taylor herself and even less footage of any performances and it's cut up and very sparse. The same story is told on the Journey To Fearless dvd but it's told by the people who lived it. Buy Journey To Fearless instead. This dvd is made for one reason: to exploit Taylor's talent and make a quick buck. It a waste of money. It was released right around the same time as ""Journey To Fearless"", so it was taking away from the market created by the much better dvd.  No wonder some artists put TM behind their name.I love Taylor's music and am not in any way putting down her or her music, it's just that this dvd is a sham. It's not an authorized product, which is why there is only about 30 secs of her CMA ""Should Have Said No"" performance and a couple of snippets of her music videos. Save your money for whenever Taylor releases a compilation of her music videos on dvd. If you don't already have them, I wholeheartedly recommend any and all her cds and the ""Journey To Fearless"" dvd. Long Live Taylor!The point I'm trying to make is, like all unauthorized dvds, it's just a bunch of people sitting around talking about Taylor.  In nice surroundings too. Out by the pool, in a nice living room.  But none of them know Taylor.  Anybody with a camera who has read a couple of books or watched another dvd could put something like this together.  But it's really just a hack job to steal from the market that the authorized dvd, ""Journey To Fearless"" has been released for. I've listed a couple of more Taylor Swift legitimate releases with dvds that are much better.Taylor Swift: Journey To FearlessSpeak Now: World Tour LiveBeautiful Eyes",1,Not worth buying,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,1883,"['can', 'find', 'better', 'things', 'spend', 'money', 'Such', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'Journey', 'Fearless', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'nothing', '61', 'mins', '5', '6', 'people', 'talking', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'life', 'carrier', 'less', '5', 'mins', 'interview', 'footage', 'Taylor', 'even', 'less', 'footage', 'performances', 'cut', 'up', 'very', 'sparse', 'same', 'story', 'told', 'Journey', 'Fearless', 'dvd', 'told', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'Buy', 'Journey', 'Fearless', 'instead', 'dvd', 'made', 'one', 'reason', 'exploit', 'Taylor', 'talent', 'make', 'quick', 'buck', 'waste', 'money', 'was', 'released', 'right', 'same', 'time', 'Journey', 'Fearless', 'was', 'taking', 'away', 'market', 'created', 'much', 'better', 'dvd', 'wonder', 'artists', 'put', 'TM', 'name.I', 'love', 'Taylor', 'music', 'am', 'not', 'way', 'putting', 'down', 'music', 'just', 'dvd', 'sham', 'not', 'authorized', 'product', 'why', 'only', 'about', '30', 'secs', 'CMA', 'Should', 'Have', 'Said', 'No', 'performance', 'couple', 'snippets', 'music', 'videos', 'Save', 'money', 'whenever', 'Taylor', 'compilation', 'music', 'videos', 'dvd', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'cds', 'Journey', 'Fearless', 'dvd', 'Long', 'Live', 'Taylor', 'point', ""'m"", 'trying', 'make', 'unauthorized', 'dvds', 'just', 'bunch', 'people', 'sitting', 'talking', 'Taylor', 'nice', 'surroundings', 'too', 'Out', 'pool', 'nice', 'living', 'room', 'none', 'know', 'Taylor', 'Anybody', 'camera', 'who', 'read', 'couple', 'books', 'watched', 'dvd', 'could', 'put', 'something', 'together', 'really', 'just', 'hack', 'job', 'steal', 'market', 'authorized', 'dvd', 'Journey', 'Fearless', 'been', 'released', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'couple', 'more', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'legitimate', 'releases', 'dvds', 'are', 'much', 'Swift', 'Journey', 'FearlessSpeak', 'Now', 'World', 'Tour', 'LiveBeautiful', 'Eyes']",N/A
