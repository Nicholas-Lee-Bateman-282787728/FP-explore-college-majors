1590102,A1O1HWFO5Q9PJ0,B009AHST9I,"A. J. ""adahl-Korean drama enthusiast""","[2, 2]","This series was very interesting and the story drew me in. In the beginning I didn't like it as it has a bit too much screaming, but even that played into the story later, so stick with it. This tells a different twist to the story of the king who invented a different alphabet for his people to make language available to everyone, not just the aristocrats. It has a good dose of politics and intrigue, murder and cunning. The cast is excellent. I think Koreans are brilliant in how much they love their history. I have learned so much watching various dramas. I have added this to my every growing collection. Now that my favorite production company has shut down, I depend ever more on Amazon for a source of series to purchase. YA Entertainment production were so well done. I hope they have all joined other companies. The subtitles from YA had to be the best. I never had a bad experience with any of their translations. I can't say that of all other purchases. The worst is when the language changes from Korean to Chinese and the translation gets changed. YA never did that. I would like reccomendations for clean translations. This series was perfect in the English translation and subtitling.",5,"Great story line, some history, action and adventure",1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,1202,"['series', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'drew', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'screaming', 'even', 'played', 'story', 'later', 'stick', 'different', 'twist', 'story', 'king', 'who', 'invented', 'different', 'alphabet', 'people', 'make', 'language', 'available', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'aristocrats', 'good', 'dose', 'politics', 'intrigue', 'murder', 'cunning', 'cast', 'excellent', 'think', 'Koreans', 'are', 'brilliant', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'history', 'have', 'learned', 'so', 'much', 'watching', 'various', 'dramas', 'have', 'added', 'growing', 'collection', 'Now', 'favorite', 'production', 'company', 'shut', 'down', 'depend', 'ever', 'more', 'Amazon', 'source', 'series', 'purchase', 'YA', 'Entertainment', 'production', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'hope', 'have', 'joined', 'other', 'companies', 'subtitles', 'YA', 'had', 'be', 'best', 'never', 'had', 'bad', 'experience', 'translations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'other', 'purchases', 'worst', 'when', 'language', 'changes', 'Korean', 'Chinese', 'translation', 'changed', 'never', 'did', 'would', 'like', 'reccomendations', 'clean', 'translations', 'series', 'was', 'perfect', 'English', 'translation', 'subtitling']",Tree with Deep Roots
1590103,A36INLW8OL3A73,B009AHST9I,"D. Aiken ""social observer""","[3, 4]","At the beginning of the Chosen Dynasty the written language used by the Korean people was Chinese characters,thousands of them that only the nobles had time to learn and use. The characters were symbolic and without relationship to the words used by the Korean people. King Lee Do,frustrated with the inability of his people to petition him and his inability to communicate to them imformation vital to them all,decided to establish an alphabet that reflected both the phonics of the Korean language and was easy to learn and use by everyone. This would upset the balance of power in the realm by allowing the &#34;great unwashed&#34; masses to have access to the government and to read and write whatever they chose,allowing even the commoners to enjoy reading whatever gave them pleasure. Thus began a long struggle by the king and a very small handful of supporters to build,from scratch,just such an alphabet,all in secret.This historical Korean Drama (kdrama as they are known) is beautifully filmed and acted by first-rate quality actors, easily on par with US movie theater quality although it was shown on Korean TV and,just so you understand,the target audience is the Korean people;they have oft-times a difference of philosophy about how things should or do go and every story having an happy ending isn't one of them.In several instances near the beginning,Chae-yoon would make drawing in a notebook and as he did,in the lower left of the screen,what he was drawing was being drawn on the screen. Another time,there was a scene someone was trying to make sense or rhyme out of hundreds of characters on stacks of paper when suddenly mental connection was made and the correct letters/symbols began to float up and began to form a thought. There are more than a few examples of the 3D graphics and special effects.This series is not an ordinary series. It is in-depth,well-played and beautifully filmed,a first-rate effort in all respects.Most highly recommended.",5,Tree with Deep Roots,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,1974,"['beginning', 'Chosen', 'Dynasty', 'written', 'language', 'used', 'Korean', 'people', 'was', 'Chinese', 'characters', 'thousands', 'only', 'nobles', 'had', 'time', 'learn', 'use', 'characters', 'were', 'symbolic', 'relationship', 'words', 'used', 'Korean', 'people', 'King', 'Lee', 'Do', 'frustrated', 'inability', 'people', 'petition', 'inability', 'communicate', 'imformation', 'vital', 'decided', 'establish', 'alphabet', 'reflected', 'phonics', 'Korean', 'language', 'was', 'easy', 'learn', 'use', 'everyone', 'would', 'upset', 'balance', 'power', 'realm', 'allowing', '34', 'great', 'unwashed', '34', 'masses', 'have', 'access', 'government', 'read', 'write', 'chose', 'allowing', 'even', 'commoners', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'gave', 'pleasure', 'Thus', 'began', 'long', 'struggle', 'king', 'very', 'small', 'handful', 'supporters', 'build', 'scratch', 'just', 'alphabet', 'secret.This', 'historical', 'Korean', 'Drama', 'kdrama', 'are', 'known', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'acted', 'first-rate', 'quality', 'actors', 'easily', 'par', 'US', 'movie', 'theater', 'quality', 'was', 'shown', 'Korean', 'TV', 'just', 'so', 'understand', 'target', 'audience', 'Korean', 'people', 'have', 'oft-times', 'difference', 'philosophy', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'do', 'go', 'story', 'having', 'happy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'one', 'them.In', 'several', 'instances', 'beginning', 'Chae-yoon', 'would', 'make', 'drawing', 'notebook', 'did', 'lower', 'left', 'screen', 'what', 'was', 'drawing', 'was', 'being', 'drawn', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'scene', 'someone', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'rhyme', 'hundreds', 'characters', 'stacks', 'paper', 'when', 'suddenly', 'mental', 'connection', 'was', 'made', 'correct', 'letters/symbols', 'began', 'float', 'up', 'began', 'form', 'thought', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'examples', '3D', 'graphics', 'special', 'effects.This', 'series', 'not', 'ordinary', 'series', 'in-depth', 'well-played', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'first-rate', 'effort', 'respects.Most', 'highly', 'recommended']",Tree with Deep Roots

1590105,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,B009AHST9I,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[8, 8]","another intense classy period Korean TV drama - with bright lighting and colors - lavish costumes & sets - and some very good actingwhile the story starts in the early 1400s - eventually it centers on the introduction of the Korean alphabet by SeJong the Great in the 1440s - but in order to make an exciting tv show out of that - large liberties with history were taken - and the emotions were amp'd up by some overwrought dialogif you're not familiar with SeJong or the writing system - i suggest looking up the history after the drama - but definitely look it up - especially the amazing story of Sejong the Greatthe main leads are a fictional young couple - an angry young swordsman - played in a very mannered style by Jang Hyuk - and a clever young women serving as a maid in SeJong's court - played by the lovely and fast-rising Shin Se KyungSeJong the Great - called by his birthname thru out the series - which is pronounced ""ee doe"" - but spelled ""Lee Do"" in the subtitles - is first seen as a man in his twenties - excellently played by Song Jung Gi (who used to be a regular in the korean tv reality show ""Running Man"") - then as a man in his forties - brilliantly played by korean superstar Han Suk Kyuthere are too many good actors to list - but i'll list one more for Kpop fans - and cuz his performance surprised me - in the role of a young scholar - Kim Ki Bum of Super Junior fame - who also lived many of his teen years in Californiaas with most period Korean dramas - there's continuous court intrigue - with the the two sides exchanging advantages - occasional Hong Kong style sword fights - it's very melodramatic at times - with long monologues - or dialog with long pregnant pauses - and a lot of repetition - the series could easily have been trimmed down from it's 24 episodes - but the continual tension and rapid developments made it feel like it went by fastthere was an hour long behind-the-scenes featurette that disappointed me by not  providing much information - altho some interaction with the supporting cast was funfactoids -written Korean is a phonetic alphabet like the Roman alphabet - but betterits introduction did create a backlash from the privileged classes whose power came from the reliance on the more difficult Chinese ideographysome cultural acts may be lost on foreigners - but there's one i don't want you to miss - when drinking from a cup or a glass - the drinker is expected to turn his head away from a person of higher age or rankto sum up - this series not as great as the good king himself - but fascinating - nice to look at - well acted - what more could you ask for",4,finding excitement behind an alphabet,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,2627,"['intense', 'classy', 'period', 'Korean', 'TV', 'drama', 'bright', 'lighting', 'colors', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'sets', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'early', '1400s', 'eventually', 'introduction', 'Korean', 'alphabet', 'SeJong', 'Great', '1440s', 'order', 'make', 'exciting', 'tv', 'show', 'large', 'liberties', 'history', 'were', 'taken', 'emotions', 'were', 'amp', ""'d"", 'up', 'overwrought', 'dialogif', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'SeJong', 'writing', 'system', 'i', 'suggest', 'looking', 'up', 'history', 'drama', 'definitely', 'look', 'up', 'especially', 'amazing', 'story', 'Sejong', 'Greatthe', 'main', 'leads', 'are', 'fictional', 'young', 'couple', 'angry', 'young', 'swordsman', 'played', 'very', 'mannered', 'style', 'Jang', 'Hyuk', 'clever', 'young', 'women', 'serving', 'maid', 'SeJong', 'court', 'played', 'lovely', 'fast-rising', 'Shin', 'Se', 'KyungSeJong', 'Great', 'called', 'birthname', 'out', 'series', 'pronounced', 'ee', 'doe', 'spelled', 'Lee', 'Do', 'subtitles', 'first', 'seen', 'man', 'twenties', 'excellently', 'played', 'Song', 'Jung', 'Gi', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'regular', 'korean', 'tv', 'reality', 'show', 'Running', 'Man', 'then', 'man', 'forties', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'korean', 'superstar', 'Han', 'Suk', 'Kyuthere', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'actors', 'list', 'i', ""'ll"", 'list', 'one', 'more', 'Kpop', 'fans', 'cuz', 'performance', 'surprised', 'role', 'young', 'scholar', 'Kim', 'Ki', 'Bum', 'Super', 'Junior', 'fame', 'who', 'also', 'lived', 'many', 'teen', 'years', 'Californiaas', 'most', 'period', 'Korean', 'continuous', 'court', 'intrigue', 'two', 'sides', 'exchanging', 'advantages', 'occasional', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'style', 'sword', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'long', 'monologues', 'dialog', 'long', 'pregnant', 'pauses', 'lot', 'repetition', 'series', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'down', '24', 'episodes', 'continual', 'tension', 'rapid', 'developments', 'made', 'feel', 'went', 'fastthere', 'was', 'hour', 'long', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'disappointed', 'not', 'providing', 'much', 'information', 'altho', 'interaction', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'funfactoids', '-written', 'Korean', 'phonetic', 'alphabet', 'Roman', 'alphabet', 'betterits', 'introduction', 'did', 'create', 'backlash', 'privileged', 'classes', 'power', 'came', 'reliance', 'more', 'difficult', 'Chinese', 'ideographysome', 'cultural', 'acts', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'foreigners', 'one', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'when', 'drinking', 'cup', 'glass', 'drinker', 'expected', 'turn', 'head', 'away', 'person', 'higher', 'age', 'rankto', 'sum', 'up', 'series', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'good', 'king', 'fascinating', 'nice', 'look', 'well', 'acted', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'ask']",Tree with Deep Roots

And during my wonderful journey of discovering this fascinating genre of film I came across this gem and was nothing short of blown away by how terrific it is!It starts with a superb script adapted from a first rate book and it just gets better from there!  Outstanding cast of gifted actors, gorgeous sets, and directed by a very gifted director.  I can't recommend it highly enough.It might be a good idea to watch a few other KHD's so you'll understand the customs and historical settings first - Dong-Yi, Dae Jange Geum a/k/a Jewel in the Palace, Yi-San, to name a few.  And if you do watch Tree with Deep Roots and love it like I do be sure to watch this director's adaptation of Painter of the Wind another script from another book by the author of Tree...Fair warning!
