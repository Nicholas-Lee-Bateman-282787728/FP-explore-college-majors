1514024,A38063DHC5X7AJ,B0069RWACE,BookshireCrone,"[0, 2]","This is a pretty embarrassing movie for Christina Ricci , Matthew Lillard, & Ann-Margret.Did they have a spare weekend free, or were they just wanting to have an excuse to do something (anything) together ? No, I'm guessing that they did it for the paycheck in between better films, sad, just sad. It might have been a decent movie if they hadn't insisted on making the renaissance fete all farce and no fun. Owen Benjamin was truly awful, either that or he's such a good actor that the stupid character he played was totally believable...nah, he & his character were cringingly bad. This comedy is too sexy for kids and too dull for adults, so the target audience must be the senile who are entertained by simple movement & bright colors",2,"waste of talent, waste of time,I should have believed the other negative reviews",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,738,"['pretty', 'embarrassing', 'movie', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Ann-Margret.Did', 'have', 'spare', 'weekend', 'free', 'were', 'just', 'wanting', 'have', 'excuse', 'do', 'something', 'anything', 'together', 'No', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'did', 'paycheck', 'better', 'films', 'sad', 'just', 'sad', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'insisted', 'making', 'renaissance', 'fete', 'farce', 'fun', 'Owen', 'Benjamin', 'was', 'truly', 'awful', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'stupid', 'character', 'played', 'was', 'totally', 'believable', 'nah', 'character', 'were', 'cringingly', 'bad', 'comedy', 'too', 'sexy', 'kids', 'too', 'dull', 'adults', 'target', 'audience', 'must', 'be', 'senile', 'who', 'are', 'entertained', 'simple', 'movement', 'bright', 'colors']",All's Faire in Love

1514027,A2CPV6UINZXKPF,B0069RWACE,"Erin ""avid reader""","[1, 6]","I was drawn in by the promise of a movie with a unique setting -- as far as I know, this is the only movie that is set at a Renaissance Faire, which I thought was brilliant. Christina Ricci and Matthew Lillard are also good actors, and I was hoping for a cute little movie. But within minutes, my excitement took a sharp turn. The acting and storyline are just plain BAD. The performances are so over-the-top, especially by Chris Wylde, that they were more akin to what you'd expect from a goofy kids movie (like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers). This was so true that I thought that kids might have been the audience they wanted, except that there were some definite adult themes, and so it really became this aimless, horrible thing. I don't know how so many well-known actors got roped into doing this flick, but it was pathetic and a struggle to watch the whole way through.",2,"Bad, bad, bad",1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,875,"['was', 'drawn', 'promise', 'movie', 'unique', 'setting', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'only', 'movie', 'set', 'Renaissance', 'Faire', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'actors', 'was', 'hoping', 'cute', 'little', 'movie', 'minutes', 'excitement', 'took', 'sharp', 'turn', 'acting', 'storyline', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'BAD', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'especially', 'Chris', 'Wylde', 'were', 'more', 'akin', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'goofy', 'kids', 'movie', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'was', 'so', 'true', 'thought', 'kids', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'audience', 'wanted', 'were', 'definite', 'adult', 'themes', 'so', 'really', 'became', 'aimless', 'horrible', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'well-known', 'actors', 'got', 'roped', 'doing', 'flick', 'was', 'pathetic', 'struggle', 'watch', 'whole', 'way']",All's Faire in Love

I found out it had been shot at my school, Mott Community College, back in 2009.  After much research on release dates i found it on amazon to rent last month.  So i did, and found it quite funny.  I didn't go in expecting anything, but i do enjoy most work by christina ricci, and matthew lillard.  It was neat seeming a portion of my school in there, along with the Michigan ren. fest as most of the staging of the movie.  But if you are looking for a few good laughs, this would be a good movie to see.

A jock in danger of failing is sentenced by his professor to work at a Renaissance Faire for three weeks in the summer. He comes into this role possessing an initial contempt and general disregard for the Faire and all involved. He does develop a bit more in personality and character as the film progresses; however, this story left me shaking my head many times. I love Renaissance Faires; however, I do not love this movie.
