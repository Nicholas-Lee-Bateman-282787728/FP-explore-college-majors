1271084,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B002JCSWM0,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 4]","A well made German movie that touches with frankness a very delicate historical subject: the mass rape of German women by Soviet soldiers during and after the Battle of Berlin. The movie, which has a good historical reconstruction of the era, is based on the memories of a woman, who choose to publish the book anonymously. After her death, it was revealed that she was a relatively well to do minor functionary in the Nazi propaganda ministry. She knew several languages including Russian and was well traveled. Her book was first published in the 1950s in Germany, but its frank portrayal of the sexual relations between the Germans and the Russians shocked many at the time who felt it besmirched German women. Also I suppose some people were afraid the book could be accused of Nazi revisionism. As a result, the book languished in obscurity for many decades afterwards, and it was only republished, with great public success, in 2003, well after the Cold war ended and the author died.According to the movie, the Russians engaged in rape not because they were sadistic (very few of them are portrayed this way) but because they have a very natural urge for sex and they had few available Russian women around among the troops. In this, the movie disagrees with the feminist adage that rape is not about sex but about power. The Russian soldiers were so starved of sex that they even rape older German women in their 60s or even 70s. As shown in this film, German women at first were obviously shocked at being raped, but later would more or less adapt to the situation and even joke about it, and seek powerful Russians as lovers, to protect themselves from mass rapes by drunken, lowly soldiers. The protagonist here seeks as a lover a Russian commander that seems to be quite a decent fellow, but who would eventually find there are problems in getting too near to her.I think that in general the movie is quite fair in its portrayal of the Russians troops. This doesn't mean that if the movie is ever shown in Russia (I seriously doubt that) the audience would feel very comfortable in the portrayal of their countrymen: most of the Soviet soldiers appear here as loud, brash, vulgar, many times drunk. But they are not portrayed as sadistic. Personally, I don't think one can make a moral equivalence between the rape of German women (which is obviously reprehensible) and the genocidal behavior of the German army in the Eastern front during World War II, killing millions of innocent Jews and Slavs (the movie should have mentioned more about the latter, I think). That objection aside, this is a fine movie.",4,Good WW2 movie touching a delicate subject,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,2619,"['well', 'made', 'German', 'movie', 'frankness', 'very', 'delicate', 'historical', 'subject', 'mass', 'rape', 'German', 'women', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'Battle', 'Berlin', 'movie', 'good', 'historical', 'reconstruction', 'era', 'based', 'memories', 'woman', 'who', 'choose', 'publish', 'book', 'anonymously', 'death', 'was', 'revealed', 'was', 'relatively', 'well', 'do', 'minor', 'functionary', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'ministry', 'knew', 'several', 'languages', 'including', 'Russian', 'was', 'well', 'traveled', 'book', 'was', 'first', 'published', '1950s', 'Germany', 'frank', 'portrayal', 'sexual', 'relations', 'Germans', 'Russians', 'shocked', 'many', 'time', 'who', 'felt', 'besmirched', 'German', 'women', 'Also', 'suppose', 'people', 'were', 'afraid', 'book', 'could', 'be', 'accused', 'Nazi', 'revisionism', 'result', 'book', 'languished', 'obscurity', 'many', 'decades', 'afterwards', 'was', 'only', 'republished', 'great', 'public', 'success', '2003', 'well', 'Cold', 'war', 'ended', 'author', 'died.According', 'movie', 'Russians', 'engaged', 'rape', 'not', 'were', 'sadistic', 'very', 'few', 'are', 'portrayed', 'way', 'have', 'very', 'natural', 'urge', 'sex', 'had', 'few', 'available', 'Russian', 'women', 'troops', 'movie', 'feminist', 'adage', 'rape', 'not', 'sex', 'power', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'were', 'so', 'starved', 'sex', 'even', 'rape', 'older', 'German', 'women', '60s', 'even', '70s', 'shown', 'film', 'German', 'women', 'first', 'were', 'obviously', 'shocked', 'being', 'raped', 'later', 'would', 'more', 'less', 'adapt', 'situation', 'even', 'joke', 'seek', 'powerful', 'Russians', 'lovers', 'protect', 'mass', 'rapes', 'drunken', 'lowly', 'soldiers', 'protagonist', 'here', 'lover', 'Russian', 'commander', 'be', 'quite', 'decent', 'fellow', 'who', 'would', 'eventually', 'find', 'are', 'problems', 'getting', 'too', 'her.I', 'think', 'general', 'movie', 'quite', 'fair', 'portrayal', 'Russians', 'troops', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'ever', 'shown', 'Russia', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'audience', 'would', 'feel', 'very', 'comfortable', 'portrayal', 'countrymen', 'most', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'appear', 'here', 'loud', 'brash', 'vulgar', 'many', 'times', 'drunk', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'sadistic', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'moral', 'equivalence', 'rape', 'German', 'women', 'obviously', 'reprehensible', 'genocidal', 'behavior', 'German', 'army', 'Eastern', 'front', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'killing', 'millions', 'innocent', 'Jews', 'Slavs', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'mentioned', 'more', 'latter', 'think', 'objection', 'aside', 'fine', 'movie']",N/A
1271085,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B002JCSWM0,Anthony Hand,"[10, 12]","A very solid film shot in that serious, no nonsense ""German"" way, that depicts a subject that for a long time was simply swept under the carpet. The mass orgy of rape and murder by Red Army soldiers of females in Eastern Europe. 'Eine Frau in Berlin' is based on the 'Anonyma' diary of a Berlin woman, Marta Hillers, who had remained nameless up until 2 years after her death. Upon the original release of her diary in the 1950's, there was such an outrage that she was compelled to with-hold any future reprints.Hillers, played namelessly by Nina Hoss, undergoes a series of brutal rapes after the Soviets roll into the streets of Berlin, which has become a city of rubble, populated by women, children and old men unfit for military service. The women (and girls) are taken by force or threat of lethal force and are utterly helpless in their hopeless situation. Hillers then decides to take matters into her own hands as best as she can in the situation that presents itself to her and tries to make sure that she decides who is to rape her, thereby giving herself what little control she is able to assign to herself. In doing so, she ""enlists"" the ""protection"" of a Soviet Officer, by offering herself to him. Over time, the officer and Hillers form a strange relationship forged in no small part by the utter chaos that surrounds them both.'Eine Frau in Berlin' covers some rough ground and it's a brave move by the producers to film the project in the first place. The location, vehicles, uniforms and people all look incredibly authentic and the viewer really does get the feel of what it was like to be a civilian on a Berlin street in the final weeks of the war. In that respect, it's a great companion piece to the excellent 'Downfall', a film which refused to touch upon the subject of mass rape at all.However, the film isn't half as harsh as it should have been, given the fact that the Soviet soldiers raped females ""from 8 to 80"" and one feels that there was still a lot left unsaid. The film is also confined to the Berliner's ordeals, which I suppose is to be expected. However, it wasn't just in Berlin, or Germany that Soviet troops unleashed their base actions. Throughout Poland, Hungary, Latvia and other countries, including parts of Russia as well, women were subject to this barbarity. There are even stories of women from ""liberated"" concentration camps being raped too.Of course, just like it's wrong to suggest that all German soldiers were nazis, it's equally wrong to suggest that all Red Army personnel engaged in wanton rape and murder and the film goes some way to showing this.In the end, the vast majority of Russians, like every soldier in WWII regardless of their nation, simply wanted the war to be over so that they could go home.",4,'Eine Frau in Berlin',1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,2770,"['very', 'solid', 'film', 'shot', 'serious', 'nonsense', 'German', 'way', 'subject', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'simply', 'swept', 'carpet', 'mass', 'orgy', 'rape', 'murder', 'Red', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'females', 'Eastern', 'Europe', ""'Eine"", 'Frau', 'Berlin', 'based', ""'Anonyma"", 'diary', 'Berlin', 'woman', 'Marta', 'Hillers', 'who', 'had', 'remained', 'nameless', '2', 'years', 'death', 'original', 'release', 'diary', '1950', 'was', 'such', 'outrage', 'was', 'compelled', 'with-hold', 'future', 'reprints.Hillers', 'played', 'namelessly', 'Nina', 'Hoss', 'series', 'brutal', 'rapes', 'Soviets', 'roll', 'streets', 'Berlin', 'become', 'city', 'rubble', 'populated', 'women', 'children', 'old', 'men', 'unfit', 'military', 'service', 'women', 'girls', 'are', 'taken', 'force', 'threat', 'lethal', 'force', 'are', 'utterly', 'helpless', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'Hillers', 'then', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'situation', 'tries', 'make', 'sure', 'who', 'rape', 'thereby', 'giving', 'what', 'little', 'control', 'able', 'assign', 'doing', 'so', 'enlists', 'protection', 'Soviet', 'Officer', 'offering', 'time', 'officer', 'Hillers', 'form', 'strange', 'relationship', 'forged', 'small', 'part', 'utter', 'chaos', ""'Eine"", 'Frau', 'Berlin', 'covers', 'rough', 'ground', 'brave', 'move', 'producers', 'film', 'project', 'first', 'place', 'location', 'vehicles', 'uniforms', 'people', 'look', 'incredibly', 'authentic', 'viewer', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'civilian', 'Berlin', 'street', 'final', 'weeks', 'war', 'respect', 'great', 'companion', 'piece', 'excellent', ""'Downfall"", 'film', 'refused', 'touch', 'subject', 'mass', 'rape', 'all.However', 'film', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'harsh', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'fact', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'raped', 'females', '8', '80', 'one', 'feels', 'was', 'still', 'lot', 'left', 'unsaid', 'film', 'also', 'confined', 'Berliner', 'ordeals', 'suppose', 'be', 'expected', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'Soviet', 'troops', 'unleashed', 'base', 'actions', 'Poland', 'Hungary', 'Latvia', 'other', 'countries', 'including', 'parts', 'Russia', 'well', 'women', 'were', 'subject', 'barbarity', 'are', 'even', 'stories', 'women', 'liberated', 'concentration', 'camps', 'being', 'raped', 'too.Of', 'course', 'just', 'wrong', 'suggest', 'German', 'soldiers', 'were', 'nazis', 'equally', 'wrong', 'suggest', 'Red', 'Army', 'personnel', 'engaged', 'wanton', 'rape', 'murder', 'film', 'way', 'showing', 'this.In', 'end', 'vast', 'majority', 'Russians', 'soldier', 'WWII', 'regardless', 'nation', 'simply', 'wanted', 'war', 'be', 'so', 'could', 'go', 'home']",N/A

My mother lived through World War II as a young girl in Magdeburg (the city in eastern Germany where Russian and American troops were to meet on the Elbe River).  Her stories about the Russian brutality ring true in this movie, and watching this movie was like reliving my mother's nightmare. The stories my grandmother told me years later were no different; she was forced to work on a farm that was designated for the Reichsarmee (German Army).I have not read the book and can not vouch for the authenticity of the movie, but that does not matter in this story.  Nina Hoss' portrayal of Anonyma is compelling, realistic and emotional, and the viewer understands there was no other way to survive as an intelligent, beautiful woman.The Russian soldiers are depicted as brutal drunks who walk the streets of Berlin looking for beautiful women to rape.  They have conquered the city and women and girls are their booty.  Anything edible or valuable is taken from the Germans for the sake of the Russians.  The civilians must survive in darken dungeons:  old men, women and children huddle under fear at any time of being killed, and indeed there are scenes were civilian men are shot so that Russian soldiers can get to the women.There are a few Russians who show compassion.  Russian actor Evgeny Sidkhin, always emotionally held back as he knows he is literally sleeping with the enemy, provides for a more human side to the Russian dilemma.  He truly cares for Nina's character and does provide for her what she needs to survive, but there is a price to pay.This movie is one of the emotionally ravaging war movies depicting civilians as the center.

1271093,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B002JCSWM0,Doctor.Generosity,"[14, 14]","This is a drama of Berlin as it was invaded by the Red Army in the spring of 1945. After 5 years of brutal war during which massive atrocities had been committed against Russian populations, the Russians were in a position to take revenge. This was significantly acted out through mass rape of German women, including young girls and the elderly. Very few Berlin women escaped multiple episodes of rape. Rape as a weapon of war or mark of conquest had been an accepted part of Asian culture for milennia, and many of the Russian soldiers were from rough peasant backgrounds. Their officers saw no reason to restrain them. Added to this was resentment of the sense of cultural superiority the Germans believed they held over the 'barbaric' Russians, and Russian anger and jealousy at the relative household wealth they observed in Berlin. It all added up to a horrific mix of rage and ""to the victors go the spoils.""Against this intense background, the movie is well produced, with solid acting, excellent cinematography, and convincing scenery of a city in ruins. The Russian soldiers are particuarly well pictured, with realistic personalities and songs. The directors also did a careful job in the delicate matter of rendering the rapes, showing just enough brutality to convey the fear and violence, but not so much dwelling on the detail as to eroticize. The filmakers did pull certain punches, such as playing down the rapes of young girls - which in actuality were well documented. To lighten this darkness, there are even fleeting moments of humor such as the post-rape comparing of notes of the German women, and one old widow who seemed almost to appreciate the reawakening of her sex life, including the compliment she received from a soldier - that ""she was so much smaller than Ukrainian women.""Just as interesting as the movie was its reception by the German public. The story is based on the wartime diary of an anonymous Berlin woman, first published in Germany in the late 1950's. The intial public reaction in Germany to the book was negative, as it related the dishonor of the women and in many cases their acceptance of the need to sell themselves. As a result no second edition was published until 2003, when emotions had died down and the German public was more ready to come to terms with the horrors of WWII. By the time this film was released in 2008, it was accepted by the German public as a valid documentation of history.An important, courageous, well constructed film.PS: The book is even better; http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ON8OVLR3676Q/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm",5,"An important film, courageous and well produced",1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,2588,"['drama', 'Berlin', 'was', 'invaded', 'Red', 'Army', 'spring', '1945', '5', 'years', 'brutal', 'war', 'massive', 'atrocities', 'had', 'been', 'committed', 'Russian', 'populations', 'Russians', 'were', 'position', 'take', 'revenge', 'was', 'significantly', 'acted', 'out', 'mass', 'rape', 'German', 'women', 'including', 'young', 'girls', 'elderly', 'Very', 'few', 'Berlin', 'women', 'escaped', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'rape', 'Rape', 'weapon', 'war', 'mark', 'conquest', 'had', 'been', 'accepted', 'part', 'Asian', 'culture', 'milennia', 'many', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'were', 'rough', 'peasant', 'backgrounds', 'officers', 'saw', 'reason', 'restrain', 'Added', 'was', 'resentment', 'sense', 'cultural', 'superiority', 'Germans', 'believed', 'held', 'over', ""'barbaric"", 'Russians', 'Russian', 'anger', 'jealousy', 'relative', 'household', 'wealth', 'observed', 'Berlin', 'added', 'up', 'horrific', 'mix', 'rage', 'victors', 'go', 'spoils', 'intense', 'background', 'movie', 'well', 'produced', 'solid', 'acting', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'convincing', 'scenery', 'city', 'ruins', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'are', 'particuarly', 'well', 'pictured', 'realistic', 'personalities', 'songs', 'directors', 'also', 'did', 'careful', 'job', 'delicate', 'matter', 'rendering', 'rapes', 'showing', 'just', 'enough', 'brutality', 'convey', 'fear', 'violence', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'dwelling', 'detail', 'eroticize', 'filmakers', 'did', 'pull', 'certain', 'punches', 'such', 'playing', 'down', 'rapes', 'young', 'girls', 'actuality', 'were', 'well', 'documented', 'lighten', 'darkness', 'are', 'even', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'humor', 'such', 'post-rape', 'comparing', 'notes', 'German', 'women', 'one', 'old', 'widow', 'who', 'seemed', 'almost', 'appreciate', 'reawakening', 'sex', 'life', 'including', 'compliment', 'received', 'soldier', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'smaller', 'Ukrainian', 'women', 'Just', 'as', 'interesting', 'movie', 'was', 'reception', 'German', 'public', 'story', 'based', 'wartime', 'diary', 'anonymous', 'Berlin', 'woman', 'first', 'published', 'Germany', 'late', '1950', 'intial', 'public', 'reaction', 'Germany', 'book', 'was', 'negative', 'related', 'dishonor', 'women', 'many', 'cases', 'acceptance', 'need', 'sell', 'result', 'second', 'edition', 'was', 'published', '2003', 'when', 'emotions', 'had', 'died', 'down', 'German', 'public', 'was', 'more', 'ready', 'come', 'terms', 'horrors', 'WWII', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', '2008', 'was', 'accepted', 'German', 'public', 'valid', 'documentation', 'history.An', 'important', 'courageous', 'well', 'constructed', 'film.PS', 'book', 'even', 'better', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/review/R2ON8OVLR3676Q/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm']",N/A

1271095,A30B0G0CIOOSQ2,B002JCSWM0,Erik Gfesser,"[61, 62]","Extremely moving film based on a memoir entitled ""Anonyma"" that was first published in 1959. Because the book was considered an affront to the honor of German women at the time, it was met with outrage and condemnation, and the author reacted by banning new editions for as long as she lived, her name not to be revealed even after her death. In some respect, the protagonist in this movie reminds this reviewer of Wolfgang Samuel's mother in ""German Boy: A Child in War"" (see my review), another memoir recounting events of the same era, although the periodic prostitution Samuel eventually acknowledged his mother had committed in order to survive the ravages of the second world war is significantly overshadowed here. Rather than isolated stints, the woman in this account develops an ongoing relationship with a Major in the Russian army in order to protect herself from the wholesale rape inflicted by hoards of Russian soldiers taking advantage of a defenseless German civilian population void of the many men who were sent to Russian slave labor camps. Hearing the frequent, gleeful statements of Russian soldiers that Germany is now simply a ""whorehouse"" now that ""old Germany is finished"" and that there are no men to protect the women, along with the scenes of rape reminiscent of ""A Terrible Revenge: The Ethnic Cleansing of the East European Germans"" (see my review), was depressing for this reviewer, resulting in not viewing this film in its entirety in one sitting. While troubling for most who view this film, the memories shared by immediate Donauschwaben (Danube Swabian) family members who over the years have shared their concentration camp experiences following the Russian invasion of Yugoslavia magnified these aspects for this reviewer. While ""Saving Private Ryan"" contained scenes that were until now among the most realistic portrayals of war this reviewer had ever seen in a film, ""A Woman in Berlin"" depicts elements that can be so much more difficult to reenact than violence between enemy combatants, and the acting and directing here are absolutely superb.",5,"""Old Germany is finished""",1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,2088,"['Extremely', 'moving', 'film', 'based', 'memoir', 'entitled', 'Anonyma', 'was', 'first', 'published', '1959', 'book', 'was', 'considered', 'affront', 'honor', 'German', 'women', 'time', 'was', 'met', 'outrage', 'condemnation', 'author', 'reacted', 'banning', 'new', 'editions', 'as', 'long', 'lived', 'name', 'not', 'be', 'revealed', 'even', 'death', 'respect', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'Wolfgang', 'Samuel', 'mother', 'German', 'Boy', 'Child', 'War', 'see', 'review', 'memoir', 'recounting', 'events', 'same', 'era', 'periodic', 'prostitution', 'Samuel', 'eventually', 'acknowledged', 'mother', 'had', 'committed', 'order', 'survive', 'ravages', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'significantly', 'overshadowed', 'here', 'Rather', 'isolated', 'stints', 'woman', 'account', 'ongoing', 'relationship', 'Major', 'Russian', 'army', 'order', 'protect', 'wholesale', 'rape', 'inflicted', 'hoards', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'taking', 'advantage', 'defenseless', 'German', 'civilian', 'population', 'void', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'sent', 'Russian', 'slave', 'labor', 'camps', 'Hearing', 'frequent', 'gleeful', 'statements', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'Germany', 'now', 'simply', 'whorehouse', 'now', 'old', 'Germany', 'finished', 'are', 'men', 'protect', 'women', 'scenes', 'rape', 'reminiscent', 'A', 'Terrible', 'Revenge', 'Ethnic', 'Cleansing', 'East', 'European', 'Germans', 'see', 'review', 'was', 'depressing', 'reviewer', 'resulting', 'not', 'viewing', 'film', 'entirety', 'one', 'sitting', 'troubling', 'most', 'who', 'view', 'film', 'memories', 'shared', 'immediate', 'Donauschwaben', 'Danube', 'Swabian', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'years', 'have', 'shared', 'concentration', 'camp', 'experiences', 'following', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'Yugoslavia', 'magnified', 'aspects', 'reviewer', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'contained', 'scenes', 'were', 'now', 'most', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'war', 'reviewer', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Woman', 'Berlin', 'elements', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'reenact', 'violence', 'enemy', 'combatants', 'acting', 'directing', 'here', 'are', 'absolutely', 'superb']",N/A

It has the courage to tell the story of what it was like in Berlin as World War II was ending - the time of the Russian siege of the city just before and just after Hitler committed suicide, ending the horror of the Nazi regime.  While many films have been made about the German populace and how they coped with the fall of their 'great Third Reich' country that was to rule the planet, few have been able to allow the audience to understand the brutalities of war on the people of Germany  in so direct a fashion.  It is a film that will haunt the viewer for a long time, a film that will restore some dignity to the German people who lived through it, not being part of Hitler's madness but being trapped in the ugliness that followed his fall.Anonyma (Nina Hoss) is a journalist, a pretty woman living in the cellars and other hiding places while the Russians took over Berlin.  She helps her fellow survivors of the bombing of Berlin, struggling for food and protection.  The Russian soldiers, still angry with the gnawing hatred for the Germans from the Siege of Leningrad and the loathing of anything that exists in Hitler's Berlin, drink heavily and seek out the women from hiding to satisfy their insatiable lust.  'Berlin is a German whorehouse' and all women, from children to youngsters to elderly fraus are continually raped and beaten as part of the victors' rage.  Anonyma speaks several languages including Russian and decides her only hope for survival is to align with the Commander of the troops, Major Andreij Rybkin (Yevgeni Sidikhin), believing that if she becomes his concubine she will be safe from the random raping by the rest of the soldiers.  Their liaisons become more than outlets for the Major and the two gradually bond despite the horrors outside their rendezvous.  They survive.  Hitler commits suicide and the war is over and the two face the reality of returning to their previous pre-war lives...or can they?Nina Hoss is brilliant in this difficult role and though the script allows her little to say, she conveys so much through her expressions that words are nearly unnecessary.  Likewise, Yevgeni Sidikhin captures the dichotomy of emotional response his character must display, finding just the right balance between the conquering Russian soldier and the compassionate and vulnerable lover.  The cinematography by Benedict Neuenfels captures the devastation not only of the buildings but also of the emotions of both sides of the participating groups and Zbigniew Preisner is responsible for the musical score that adds immeasurably to the drama.  This is one of the great German films that took many years of maturing to make.  It should be seen.

However, ""A Woman in Berlin"" turned my understanding of the depth of human misery during the aftermath of war on its head. It's easy to forget just how brutal and remorseless the effects of WW II were on the German civilians (women, children, and men too old or too infirm to fight) who were forced to scrape their meager livings in bombed cities with no food, no heating - in addition to being held in universal contempt and suspicion as suspected Hitler sympathizers.""A Woman in Berlin"" demonstrated that in wartime, all societal niceties were pitched out the figurative window quicker than the nearest chamber pot. The Russian troops who ""liberated"" Berlin in this movie quickly were shown to be drunken oppressors. The women were regularly raped. Benumbed by wartime exigencies these Berlin women (married or single, young and pretty, or old and withered) quickly saw the way the winds were blowing and began to play up to certain Russian soldiers as protectors. Playing the role of whores left those women with the knowledge that their actions would make them untouchable, unspeakable to any surviving husbands or family. With all the chattiness of a quilting bee, the women had a creepy discussion about syphilis, surely a hazard of their ""liberation.""There was no happy ending to this movie; not even a note of hope. The end of Hitler's war seemed to mark only the start of a different species of war, that of survival and rebuilding.  Recriminations among those who survived the war would come later.

He was blown away by the realism of the film, as was I.  The woman protagonist lives through the invasion of the Red Army soldiers in Berlin at the close of WWII and the occupation after the fall of the city.The situation of women in war becomes all too clear as the description of Berlin as one big whorehouse is  mentioned more than once.  Women of all ages are forced to submit to rape over and over again.  (My holocaust-survivor friend said Soviet soldiers even raped women they liberated in the concentration camps!)Our anonymous protagonist, who has the advantage of being able to speak Russian, decides she will find the Commander of the troops and submit only to him, and thereby get protection.  Not only does she survive the invasion, but she even finds her heart responding to the man who protects her.A fascinating contrast is revealed in the attitude of Berlin Germans toward Russians (Germans, proud of their culture, considered the Russians barbarians and animals) to the described actions of German soldiers, who, when in Russia, picked up children by their feet and killed them by bashing their heads into walls.  Also contrast that to Russian soldiers who, although they drunkenly raped women indiscriminately, did not target children for killing and exhibited a desire to be home with their families.  I sensed the beginning of post-war German guilt in our protagonist when a Russian soldier describes the German soldiers' murder of children.One is left with both the horror of war, especially as it affects women, and the stunning will to survive whatever happens and, curiously, the way human connections can interject themselves in the midst of war.",5,Realistic portrayal of Soviet occupation of Berlin,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,1785,"['saw', 'film', 'holocaust', 'survivor', 'camp', 'was', 'liberated', 'Soviet', 'Red', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'reeking', 'Vodka', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'realism', 'film', 'was', 'woman', 'protagonist', 'invasion', 'Red', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'Berlin', 'close', 'WWII', 'occupation', 'fall', 'city.The', 'situation', 'women', 'war', 'becomes', 'too', 'clear', 'description', 'Berlin', 'one', 'big', 'whorehouse', 'mentioned', 'more', 'once', 'Women', 'ages', 'are', 'forced', 'submit', 'rape', 'over', 'again', 'holocaust-survivor', 'friend', 'said', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'even', 'raped', 'women', 'liberated', 'concentration', 'camps', 'anonymous', 'protagonist', 'who', 'advantage', 'being', 'able', 'speak', 'Russian', 'will', 'find', 'Commander', 'troops', 'submit', 'only', 'thereby', 'get', 'protection', 'Not', 'only', 'survive', 'invasion', 'even', 'heart', 'responding', 'man', 'who', 'her.A', 'fascinating', 'contrast', 'revealed', 'attitude', 'Berlin', 'Germans', 'Russians', 'Germans', 'proud', 'culture', 'considered', 'Russians', 'barbarians', 'animals', 'described', 'actions', 'German', 'soldiers', 'who', 'when', 'Russia', 'picked', 'up', 'children', 'feet', 'killed', 'bashing', 'heads', 'walls', 'Also', 'contrast', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'who', 'drunkenly', 'raped', 'women', 'indiscriminately', 'did', 'not', 'target', 'children', 'killing', 'exhibited', 'desire', 'be', 'home', 'families', 'sensed', 'beginning', 'post-war', 'German', 'guilt', 'protagonist', 'when', 'Russian', 'soldier', 'German', 'soldiers', 'murder', 'children.One', 'left', 'horror', 'war', 'especially', 'women', 'stunning', 'will', 'survive', 'happens', 'curiously', 'way', 'human', 'connections', 'can', 'interject', 'midst', 'war']",N/A

I can't say that it is entertaining in that it is dark and makes no pretense of a happy ending. It is a story of survival and the choices people must make in extraordinary circumstances. The victorious occupying army has reason for wanting to exact revenge upon these defenseless people. In truth I expected the story to be much more harsh than it was, based on the ruthlessness of the German armies in their marches towards Moscow. This Russian motivation was explained several times and via different methods though some reviewers suggest it was not.I did appreciate the commitment of the director to historical accuracy.

It is well done and gives a realistic glimpse of how people behave during times of chaotic upheaval. The consequences of war are immeasurable and last a life time.

After she and the women of her neighborhood are raped and beaten repeatedly by Red Army soldiers, she determines to get as much control of her desperate circumstances as possible. She seeks out an officer of the Red Army to whom she offers herself in exchange for his protection. Rebuffed at first by Major Andrei Rybkin (Yevgeni Sidikhin), the two develop a fond relationship of mutual escapism from the horrors around them.The protagonist is nameless. Until recently, she was known only as ""Anonyma"", the name under which she published her memoirs in Germany in 1959. They were not well-received. The author was accused of shaming German women with her descriptions of prostitution for protection. The memoirs were not published again until 2003, when ""A Woman in Berlin"" became a bestseller in Germany, and its author's identity was revealed as Marta Hillers. Hillers was a journalist and minor Nazi propagandist who spoke German, Russian, and French. There is reportedly some material in the book that was not in her diaries from 1945, so it may have been embellished for publication, though the circumstances are similar to many other accounts of civilian experiences in parts of the city controlled by the Red Army during the Battle of Berlin.There are nasty scenes of battle, as remnants of the German Army try to defend the city against an angry and marauding Red Army, with civilians caught in the crossfire. The Battle of Berlin created one of the most hellish environments in modern times. It has been the setting of a couple of very good films in recent years, perhaps because the devastation was rendered so visually. It is almost as if nothing need be said, making it ideal for the medium of film. ""A Woman in Berlin"" doesn't actually have a lot of dialogue. It's quiet. The expressions on people's faces match the city in ruins around them. It is unsentimental. Anonyma and Andrei are not heroic, perhaps not even respectable. They are just people trying to make the best of horrible circumstances. In German and Russian with English subtitles that cannot be turned off.

It deserves 5 stars for superb acting, an horrific and heartwrenching story based on the true accounts, grim sets and photography, and a pervading mood of despair.A German journalist, Nina Hoss as the dark eyed, beat-up, unintentional siren, stays behind in Berlin to document the invasion by the Russians(Soviets).  Soon, she finds herself caught up in the rape and destruction of the city, and it's helpless civilians.  After repeated attacks against herself, in desperation, she seeks out a protector, and finds a mysterious Russian officer(Evgeny Sidikhin)with a haunted past.  Interested in her but somewhat reluctantly, he agrees, and what follows becomes a tale of relationships and common ground amidst hell on earth.Without wanting to justify them, the writers, to a degree, show both sides of the conflict.  The Russians, in general, long for their families, hate the war which dragged them in there, and relate awful memories of the atrocities that the Germans laid on their homeland.  Paying evil for evil does not make right their actions in any way, but I suppose it brings a sort of balance and understanding to the story.Thankfully, the assaults are shown non-gratuitously, and there is a scene of nudity to make a point, but that's about it for graphic filming. But one gets the message. The whole film is depressing.

1271122,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B002JCSWM0,Paul Allaer,"[0, 0]","""A Woman in Berlin"" (2008 release from Germany; 127 min.) brings the true events as witnessed by the main character (who wrote a book of the same title) in the waning days of WWII, as the Soveits were conquering more and more of Berlin. The main character is played by Nina Hoss, recounting how she and others in her street are trying to survive amidst the chaos and terror that was the Red Army. The Soviets plundered and murdered and raped, driving the women in Berlin to desparate measures to survive. A woman in the movie comments that ""War and dying used to be men's business"". Nina Hoss' character eventually seeks protection from a Russian major, and curiously, a strange kind of friendship seems to develop between these two. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is not for the faint of heart. In particular the first hour of the movie is just brutal, even though thankfully not all of the violence is shown on the screen, but we nevertheless understand quite well what is happening. Second, this movie brings a sense of the hardship that so many had to endure during WWII. Third, there is a never-ending fascination within the German movie community to examine its dark days during the Nazi regine, and this movie is a good example of it (for another good example, check out the just-released movie calle ""Lore"" which also happens to be set in the waning days and the immediate aftermatch of the end of WWII). Last but certainly not least, what can you say about Nina Hoss' performance in this movie, it will simply blow you away. Hoss surely must be the top German actress of this generation (for yet another great Hoss performance, check out last year's equally excellent movie called ""Barbara"", set in East Germany of the 1908s).Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. Even though this does not always makes for easy viewing, ""A Woman in Berlin"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,"""War and dying used to be men's business""",1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,2136,"['Woman', 'Berlin', '2008', 'release', 'Germany', '127', 'min', 'true', 'events', 'witnessed', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'waning', 'days', 'WWII', 'Soveits', 'were', 'conquering', 'more', 'more', 'Berlin', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Nina', 'Hoss', 'recounting', 'how', 'others', 'street', 'are', 'trying', 'survive', 'amidst', 'chaos', 'terror', 'was', 'Red', 'Army', 'Soviets', 'plundered', 'murdered', 'raped', 'driving', 'women', 'Berlin', 'desparate', 'measures', 'survive', 'woman', 'movie', 'comments', 'War', 'dying', 'used', 'be', 'men', 'business', 'Nina', 'Hoss', 'character', 'eventually', 'protection', 'Russian', 'major', 'curiously', 'strange', 'kind', 'friendship', 'develop', 'two', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'movie', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'particular', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'just', 'brutal', 'even', 'thankfully', 'not', 'violence', 'shown', 'screen', 'nevertheless', 'understand', 'quite', 'well', 'what', 'happening', 'Second', 'movie', 'sense', 'hardship', 'so', 'many', 'had', 'endure', 'WWII', 'Third', 'never-ending', 'fascination', 'German', 'movie', 'community', 'examine', 'dark', 'days', 'Nazi', 'regine', 'movie', 'good', 'example', 'good', 'example', 'check', 'out', 'just-released', 'movie', 'calle', 'Lore', 'also', 'be', 'set', 'waning', 'days', 'immediate', 'aftermatch', 'end', 'WWII', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Nina', 'Hoss', 'performance', 'movie', 'will', 'simply', 'blow', 'away', 'Hoss', 'surely', 'must', 'be', 'top', 'German', 'actress', 'generation', 'yet', 'great', 'Hoss', 'performance', 'check', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'equally', 'excellent', 'movie', 'called', 'Barbara', 'set', 'East', 'Germany', '1908s', '.Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'mood', 'top-notch', 'quality', 'foreign', 'movie', 'MILES', 'away', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'Even', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'viewing', 'Woman', 'Berlin', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

there is never a simple reason for war. its complex, and rarely do two people agree the terms of it. i am german (american), though i hold no sympathy for germans. after all, my people's war, that is the war that my people waged across europe, warrants no sympathy. but then, neither does the occupation of berlin by the red army. war is senseless from the perpetrators to the people defending their country/people. its not a pretty effort, and never has any side of a war maintained a battalion of guiltless soldiers. if you fight in war, you are killing people. there is no right to that. defense or not.this movie was written based on that fact. i think the one star viewers were looking for a love story. the fact that any of them complained about the rape and the brutality is clue enough that they have no concept or understanding what happens in war. let me assure you, limbs are cut off, people are tormented and maimed, rapes are multitudinous and much more brutal than what can be shown in a movie. one viewer said that she turned it off 15 minutes into the movie because of the 'gratuitous' violence. its war. how did you expect that the movie would look? did you expect a hollywood dramatization about two people in love? did you expect their love story to sugar coat the reality of the war they were plunged in the middle of? this movie is about a woman who wanted to survive. so she did. in the process of a highly complex situation, where people are hurled into a situation where you must love and despise your captors all the same, she survived. and she fell in love. that itself is a complex situation. two hours is not long enough to unravel the emotional psyche of why or how they did fall in love, or if it was real, or if it was a victim-abuser paradigm.this was a well-made movie. one depiction of the occupation of berlin, though again, probably not an accurate one. i would imagine that the russians were much, much angrier than the movie portrayed and probably assaulted the citizens of berlin to such a degree that a movie could never be made from real events. i think that it was a 'polite' depiction of real events. and if you are able to focus on a woman's will to survive at a time when one wrong word, one wrong glance could mean death, then perhaps you can piece together a more accurate reality of what occurred alongside your viewing it.i give it three stars because i do agree that the depth of characters was just not there. there was something missing. you felt no sympathy for the captive because the writer/film maker was not successful in creating real, deep, emotional characters. i think that the brutality should have been greater, not because i get off on it (i hate violence) but because the reality of what happened would have garnered a real sympathy. the german women were not terrified in this movie as they probably were in real life. so it was hard to relate to them. it was hard to relate to the main character because given the way that the movie was made, WITHOUT 'gratuitous' violence, it made you wonder why she was trying so hard to survive. i think the film maker did an injustice by lightening the atrocities to make it palatable for the viewer (and to get the movie made. no financial backers are going to take on a movie where real war atrocities are vividly portrayed), and in the end, he wound up with unbelievable characters who we find it hard to feel empathy for. after watching this movie, my thought was 'if only war was really this mild.'with that said. it was well made. the cinematography was excellent. the cast was excellent. the story was based on real events, but someone took some serious liberties with that woman's journals to make it palatable for modern-day consumption. we are sheltered from the reality of war in most countries. count your blessings one and all.",3,gratuitous?

It is based on the diaries of a young German woman, journalist, who lived through that time.  What is interesting is the honest way she described what she, and perhaps others like her, did to survive the horrors of the occupation.  In her case, because she was well educated and spoke Russian, she offered herself to the commander of the Red Army.  She had already been brutally raped by the foot soldiers and she decided that, if she was to be raped again, which was likely she would at least have some say in who would do it.  Just to read those words may sound horrifying and, indeed, the diaries were shocking to the German population when they were first published.  But the film, at least, is so well made and acted, that the journalist's decisions were completely understandable.  She and the Russian commander seem to fall in love, at least that's how it looks in the film, and we feel the enormous pathos of love in the time of war.  In one of their conversations she says that in wartime that words change their meaning, and she cites the one word 'love"" that she's talking about.  Who among us can dispute that?  I found the scene in which she thanked the commander, as he is about to leave the city, for letting her get to know him, extremely moving!  This was indeed a form of love....The film is hard to watch, especially in the first part, and I nearly didn't stick with it.  The photography is wonderful except that most of what we see is gray desolation.  The acting is first rate, with both the German actress and the Russian actor doing beautiful jobs.

After a while Anonyma has the idea of hooking up with an officer, in the hope that this would offer some protection against the lawless soldiers.

Blanchard ""DVD Movie Buff""","[5, 6]","I was not able to find this movie at any of the video rental stores so I was anxious to see how this subject would be presented. This subject was mentioned in a book by Cornelious Ryan called ""The Last Battle"" where Ryan mentioned that the Russians raped thousands of German women during the Battle for Berlin. The Russians felt this was revenge of all the terrible things the Nazis did in the Soviet Union. I noticed that a couple of people also were in another movie by the same producer called ""Downfall"" so you can tell the set and story line was done with the same amount of attention to detail. It starts out great with the German civilians hiding in the basements and cellars of the building hoping that they will not be harmed. But, in the end, the Russians storm the buildings and start picking out women who are raped (not too graphic scenes but you get the idea). I like the scene where the German commander is forced to talk on the loud speaker that Hitler is dead and for the German civilians or soldiers to cease fighting. The Russians break out with a large cheer and start sing the Russian national song. The noise can be heard inside the buildings where the Germans are hiding in shame for losing the war. In the second half of the movie, it starts to slow down after the German woman learns her Russian Major is being transferred and her husband returns to find out that she is now a collabrator with the Red Army. I totally suggest this movie as it is the only movie I have seen that addresses this topic.
