You have to deal with so much nonsense. And on top of everything in this post 9-11 world things in America seem less certain than they used to. Spielberg cracks me up. Leave it to him to make a story about an alien invasion of the planet and the freakin' end of the world into a portrait of a man learning what it means to be a father to his kids. But of coarse, it's brilliant. As non-presidents and non-elites most of us would face disaster with the perspective of Tom Cruise's character and his family.If you don't like the changes one of our greatest film directors made to the old story look -- WHATEVER TO THAT. Yea that reminds me of King hating THE SHINNING (at least he was the author of the book). Does it matter? NO. Who cares? NOBODY. Because it's a cinematic masterpiece and this Spielberg sci-fi flick is a real fine film.I'd argue it's (at least) a minor sci-fi classic. Sci-fi combined with another genre sometimes produces the most incredible results: In this case we're treated to sci-fi/horror. And I've never seen an alien invasion portrayed this realistically. Your on the ground with regular people, running and getting trapped, barely missing getting zapped, or feed into a machine.

634921,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B00005JNTI,Ace-of-Stars,"[13, 18]","*I hate ""happy endings.""Well, that's not entirely true. What I hate are ""CONTRIVED"" happy endings -- something Spielberg is a master at (see his phony dopey ending to his handling of the Kubrick project ""A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"" for the ultimate example). And the sad fact is that EVERYTHING in this movie seems ""contrived,"" not just the 'happy ending.'While keeping with the spirit of the original H.G. Wells story, this movie expects us to believe that for untold ages, prior to even the appearance of man on Earth, an extraterrestrial alien race had buried war machines deep underground and waited until the early 21st century to begin engaging in an extermination campaign? For what? For ""sport""? (Damn, that would mean that they've got greater patience than the ""Predator"" race -- re: ""AVP."") Or for ""colonization""? (Why could they have not colonized the Earth ""before"" the advent of man?)One of the more vocal complaints I hear about this movie concerns the unfortunate portrayal of yet another example of a ""disinterested"" and ""incompetent"" father, but since no explanation was ever given as to why this family was fractured as it was, or why Ray (Cruise) was seemingly so out of touch with his children and their lives, it was something I could personally overlook and for which I could form any number of interpretations.But as so many others before me have already expressed, one of the biggest problems-- if not 'THE' biggest --is that there are just way too many plot holes spattered throughout this film that it makes it difficult to be considered as even mindless time-wasting popcorn entertainment. It's main saving grace is its stunning visuals & detailed special effects -- and its pacing is, for the most part, very well executed (kudos to the editors).I've since come to accept the ease with which the first successful destruction of one of the tripods occurred and how Ray was able to be pulled free from it with amazingly little difficulty, as this would likely coincide with the timeframe in which the microbial 'incubation period' had reached fatal levels and began to affect (weaken) the invaders. But the 'wrap-up' came much too quickly, not only immediately after this incident but also for the conclusion of the film. Yes, we all know the reason for the sudden massive & undignified deaths of the invaders, but it would have been nice if the characters had been shown coming to this realization on their own, rather than concluding with a rehashing of the narrative epilogue we're all familiar with.I hate to say it, but overall I found the entire movie boring and less than compelling. This had less to do with the 'entertainment value' of the movie (as I still considered it entertaining enough to grant it a ""three star"" rating, though a more accurate reflection would be a ''low three'' -- roughly a ''C-minus'') and had more to do with the truckloads of illogical situations & explanations -- everything from the attack vehicles' being 'buried for millennia' before being utilized (in perfect working operation without so much as a speck of rust on them) to the extremely unlikely happy-sappy 'family reunion' ending.If it were all meant to be satire I could easily forgive some, if not all, of these discrepancies and non-sequiturs. But since Spielberg & company decided they wanted to play it 'above board,' it has no 'veritas.'Spielberg's take on ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" could have been handled much better, in my opinion, but at least it was better handled and more believable than that other horrendously over-the-top Spielberg project, ""MINORITY REPORT.""",3,"As ""Mr. Spock"" would say ...

A man is asked to work overtime but refuses (family first). This looks like the New York city area. A couple plans to leave for a visit out of state. The TV news tells of strong electrical storms abroad. This man and his son play a game of catch until one throw is missed. This family has problems. There is darkness in the sky and a high wind. Lightning flashes in the sky, people are scared. There is no electricity! Cars have stopped running! Was it a solar flare? People look at a hole in the street. Cracks appear in the street and cause damage to property. Water spurts from a broken main. Something big and dangerous erupts from the ground! People scream and run. ""OMG!"" Rays of force annihilate people on the ground! Houses, too. What can they do now? Get a revolver?""Get in the car or you're going to die!"" shouts Ray. [Why did one car manage to work? Product placement?] They don't wear seatbelts. Some houses have lights. No one is home. They sleep in the cellar. There are strange lights and noise. Outside they find a crashed jet airplane. ""Once the tripods move into an area no news comes out."" They drive away. [Where did they get gas?] Bodies float by in a river. Soldiers pass by in their military vehicles. They drive and see refugees on the road. Some beg for rides. A crowd attacks their car after it crashes. Shots command attention. Their car is hijacked, it leaves without them. They walk across a bridge. There is a horrible sight. People try to get on a boat to cross the Hudson. Then the boats lists to one side and capsizes! People and cars slide into the river. Rachel, Ray, and Robbie reach land. They see tripods in the distance. Military forces advance towards the lightning and thunder. Robbie wants to see the action. Ray rescues Rachel.They seek refuge in the cellar of a house. Those tripods were buried beneath the surface for a million years. Will they exterminate humanity? A man advises against running away. Can they kill the tripods? What can they do? The noise outside stops. A tentacle invades the cellar, like a long snake. Will they be discovered? Strange creatures enter the basement, look around, then leave. The morning light shows what happened to the people caught by the alien creatures. Ray keeps things quiet. There is a sudden surprise! Ray uses his axe. Is there no escape? A tentacle gathers another trophy. One tripod gets indigestion. The survivors walk to Boston. Some of the tripods fell down. An anti-tank rocket hits another. We see one of the alien creatures. Rachel meets her Mommy. Robbie is there too. A voice explains how microbes killed off the invaders.Herbert George Wells wrote this over a century ago. This may be the first movie adapted from it. Did the plot inspire ""Night of the Living Dead"" and similar horror movies where humanity is threatened by strange invaders. The idea of strange beings planted below ground echoes the ideas of vampires or zombies. Who can believe that? Does the happy ending seem tacked-on? The great terror in this movie suggests it would not be successful. It has some spectacular events and large crowd scenes. Given the lack of electricity (as with Hurricane Sandy) where did they get the gasoline (no fuel pumps), water, and food (no refrigerators or transport)?

The action scenes from the very beginning are intense and well-executed and the plot flows nicely.A couple of criticisms include the tedious subplot of Cruise's strained realationship with his teenage son. A few minutes could have been cut from these scenes and no one would have missed anything. Also, the middle and ending were weak with respect to the science surrounding the fate of the invaders. The movie could have used a boost of ""Michael Creighton"" here, especially since the first and last scenes focus on this very topic.Before going to the movie I read a few (mostly negative) reviews from some of the professional critics, one of whome was concerned about the fact that the machines in the film were tripods, which made them unstable and therefore unbelievable. To these kinds of comments I can only say that next time you see an invading force of alien machines, make a sketch so we all know what's realistic and what's not.I recommend this movie for its pure entertainment value.

634924,APDMVBRLIBCZV,B00005JNTI,"Add 'em Up At The Movies ""Adam""","[6, 12]","The original 1953 film ""War Of The Worlds"" is a sci-fi classic that modern day Hollywood feels the need to re-make with a lot of over-the-top special effects that look even more obviously fake to me than what was seen in the original film.The screenplay was adapted from H.G. Wells' novel, and instead of earning a place right next to the novel ""War Of The Worlds"" in the bookcase, this screenplay belongs in the fire place next to the bookcase. So many things in this film are just laughably bad. For example, the scene that has Tom Cruise's character standing and watching with pride as his kids do the work. The special effects are over done and not at all scary, haunting, eerie, or even thrilling, they're quite dull and used just for the sake of seeing how much they could do with special effects to top other movies' special effects. It was actually eerie in the original 1953 film without all the forced effects.This pathetic, unoriginally bad remake should have made Steven Spielberg swing his tail (if he had one) between his legs and run home in shame. It's far worse than his film ""1941"" which was considered to be one of his worst efforts as a director. However, he has since redeemed himself with the admirable film ""Munich"" (2005), as he did with ""1941"" (1979), coming back two years later with the adventure classic ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" (1981). Great directors like Spielberg do make a bad choice for a project every now and then, and in my opinion, this is Spielberg's worst. The Cruise/Spielberg collaboration in the futuristic ""Minority Report"" (2002) was much better than this disaster. Which brings me to this disasterous remake's star, Tom Cruise, who is no longer an actor, but continues to be primarily a star as he has been for years. Once upon a time, Cruise was an actor and a star when he managed to turned in some good performances such as the film that made him a star ""Risky Business"", then his great performance in ""Rain Man"", and, yes, even in ""The Firm"", but his ego obviously took over turning him into just a ""movie star"" using film choices just as vehicles for his fading stardom kept mostly by his tabloid news making personal life; i.e. ""Mission: Impossible III"" coming to theaters soon. So, his performance in ""War Of The Worlds"" is your standard Tom Cruise performance, about as good as anyone can do with such a seemingly stupid and arrogant character. Dakota Fanning (who as young as she is, is an actress and not just a 'child star') is the only decent thing about this film as Cruise's daughter, but nothing at all can save this pointless, money making trashing of a classic. If you want to see ""War Of The Worlds"", do yourself a favor and rent the classic or buy it on dvd.A personal note on remakes and the originals: There is only ONE remake of a classic that was far and away better than the original to me, and it is ""12 Angry Men"" (1997). It was not released in theaters but premiered on Showtime. It was the only remake that worked better than the original because of the one thing that never works in remakes, modernizing. It used basically the same original screenplay by Reginald Rose, but it is modernized and accompanied with stronger performances by a better ensamble cast than the performances given by the actors in the original 1957 film. Plus, it was not made for the sake of making money at all. Premiering on cable and then going to video and dvd proves that without question.

Tom Cruise was decent and so was the little girl, Dakota Fanning who is the cutest little actress ever and Justin Chatwin who actually stole the show.He played the rebelliously rebellious, predictably-annoying teen who despised His father and most of His surroundings. I think He was mainly pissed at the break up between His father (Tom) and His mother, Miranda Otto.I loved how dark almost every scene was. The only remotely light one I remember was when the three (everyone but the ex, who lived in Her own home) were at home.

Tom Cruise is lumped with the most aggravating bunch of totally unbelievable moronic characters I've ever seen in my life. Miranda Otto's utterly pointless at a pregnant ex-wife who exists soley to hang sh** on Tom and tell us his character is a loser. Dakota Fanning screams, whines, cries, acts like a loud-mouthes 40 year old in a kid's body and makes stupid, moronic comments like ""are we still alive?"" (no, you're dead, darling, what do you think?)and when Tom orders her around because the whole world's being destroyed a petulant ""could you be a bit nicer to me?"" Argghhh!!!As for Justin Whatsisface (whoever! Where the Heck do they FIND these no-talent pains in the neck?) as the apathetic son, my God, this fool wants to run off and join the army and kick some alien butt when the human race is losing like lambs in a slaughterhouse. If I was his Dad, I'd have kicked his backside so hard and dragged him away, at gun point if need be (Tom has a gun, but lamely forgets it for so long...).As for the plot credibility...a plane crashes and yet the wreckage contains not a single dead body, Cruise drives through plane wreckage without getting a flat tyre, he finds the safe route through dozens of other vehicles which are all conveniently motionless. Kids refuse food on the grounds they're not hungry, despite the fact these could be their survival rations in a devastated world, EMPs fail to knock out video cameras or media crews, and Wells' story is changed for no reason at all in ways that destroy the plot...the aliens planted their ships here millions of years ago? Why? They only decide to invade because Mars is now dying...were they just ""thinking ahead?"" If so, why wait for Man to evolve? Huh? I don't know who I hated most, Dakota Fanning, that idiot brother, or the fool who wrote this ghastly damn screenplay!At the end of the day I think H.G Wells's story is wonderful and I really wanted, WANTED so badly, to enjoy seeing it come alive with modern FX, but for the love of God, the whole stupid, crass, insulting story and irritating acting totally destroyed the experience. I can only assume people who gave this a good rating were kids or people who never read the book or saw the old film. They should have given Gene Barry a prominent role and told the kids to shut their mouthes.As for the ending...please! Can America make a movie these days without celebrating American militarism and the War on Terror? Just for once? Since the Weapons of Mass Destruction turned out to not exist, the whole reason for sending troops to Iraq (which had no connection at all to the Sept 11 attacks) are not exactly popular or accepted. The sight of troops bringing down tripods with rocket launchers when Atom Bombs couldn't scratch them in the 50s film is just risible.

Tom Cruise seems to be too young to be the father of the son who seems rather too big and sulky for his age. Instead of a father he seems to be his elder brother, or when they are wriggling on the ground with each other, two pals from the same street with an age difference between them....The movie jumps to the action instantly; yes in the original flick it works but it is a small community you can easily sense and be connected with the characters there; but in this age this does not work...you need more background about characters to care for them...and what was better thing than dropping ominious signs here and there at the beginning except a few news casts and huge lightnings just to make you feel thrilled with anticipation? Spielberg tries to drop signs but an over-speedy way. He should have consulted Stephen King to learn one or two things on how to drop ominious signs around at the beginning when the script was being written.Guess scriptwriters or Spielberg have no daughter at all. No child on earth could scream like that throughout the whole event like this. Children adapt to terrible conditions with more flexibility and easiness than adults...Once more Spielberg should have talked to Stephen King to learn a few things about children reacting disastrous conditions.But special effects are suberp. Tripods are real frightening and their devastation of earth is believable...but where are other small but meaningful nuances that make destruction much more palpable? White House, Hollywood hills, Manhattan scrapelines could be devastated...symbols of the USA, and in some cases, the humanity. Talk about Stephen King's the Stand...Where are scenes from the rest of the world? Independent Day, much more exciting and compact B trash than this, wins over easily in this respecct?How does the Army react the Aliens? With rifles!!! For God's sake!!! thanks that they did not go for slingshots...Everyone today in the world is afraid of nuclear war...why on earth does no one try to drop more high-complex weapons against Aliens? Maybe all destroyed by Aliens? Then we should have seen it. In the original flick they even try the atom bomb, one of the highlights of the movie...I cannot forget how the folks had to admit that even the atom bomb did not work because of the shield. Then how was the shield eliminated in current version? No answer... suddenly birds hop on the Tripods as if they were animals swishing around in water.Oh I could go on and on forever...And the re-appearance of the boy at his grandparents house in Boston with no harm, even a scratch (only some dirt) is the most laughable thing considering that the boy had bravely thrown himself before the aliens and that area was burned to the ground as far as the movie goes.There are nice things, be sure.

634928,A1DGAYHCDXE7FU,B00005JNTI,AH-1Z,"[33, 39]","This is a really, really good movie.  No, it's not a literal depiction of the H.G. Wells novel,  but they never said it was going to be.  It's sort of an ""Inspired by"" version.  The basic elements of Wells' tale are here, placed into our time and world.  To do that there have to be some changes.This has both advantges and disadvantages.  The latter include that we know already how the story has to end (although apparently some reviewers have never read the book, judging by their comments), but if you're good enough, you can still create suspense and maintain interest throughout the whole picture.  Spielberg and Cruise are good enough.  To draw a parallel, in the TV show ""Smallville"", we Know he's going to grow up to be Superman.  We Know he's not going to end up with Lana.  We Knew the friendship with Luthor couldn't last.  Still, they made the  journey itself interesting.  Same thing here, in spades.People have to understand this in order to review the movie fairly.  Certain things about anyone doing the War of the Worlds just have to be there.  Aliens;  We're losing; An everyman who doesn't solve the situation, just survives it;  TRIPODS!  The 1953 version (which I enjoyed) didn't have them because the FX technology of the time didn't permit them to make them realistically.  With what we can do now, any version that didn't have them would be unacceptable;  Germs.  Accept it, folks.  The Titanic sinks at the end.  Like it or not, Custer dies.  Bruce Wayne is Batman.  No one recognizes it's Superman behind Clark Kent's glasses.  In Wells' story, we are saved by germs.  Spielberg doesn't get to change that and still call it War of the Worlds.One clever thing that was done here was that everything was seen from the Earthlings' point of view.  There was no attempt to explain why the aliens came (""They need our land/resources/women, etc. so they can relocate from their dying world/save their dying planet/breed and save their dying race, etc..."").  We have no idea why they're here, and It Doesn't Matter.  They're just here, slaughtering everyone in sight. Apparently they need the planet itself becuase they don't just nuke Earth from space and they do start their version of terraforming.  However, none of the characters in the movie know why this is happening, and again, It Doesn't Matter.  The movie says to us, ""Give us that it's happening, and we'll play fair with you in the context of Wells' basic plot"".  Some might argue that the ""biological"" ending wouldn't really happen (our bacteria might not recognize the  aliens as food), but that's how Wells' ended it and any other ending would be a cheat.Tom Cruise gives a brauva performance.  Despite whether you like or dislike him personally, the man can act.  This movie wasn't the only demonstration of that, just the best.  He's totally believable in his characterization, performance and evolution, and at the point where it appears he's going to sacrifice himself, it's completely credible.  It's not in there just to make the star look heroic, it makes total sense, given what's happening and what he expects the immediate future to be.  He never gives up.  Not a ""Die Hard"" type of never-gives-up, just a that's the way it has to be kind of never-gives-up.Although I think it would have been more bittersweet and better at the end if Robbie hadn't been found, I can accept it, especially since Ray's relationship with his ex-wife doesn't magically turn into bliss as would a typical Hollywood ending.

So, it's an irony that I would like this movie as much as I do. It's a remake, with a lot of CGI. And yet I think it's surprisingly good.This version of the story focuses on a divorced man who is watching his son and daughter at the time of the alien's invasion. He simply can NOT connect with them, and as the story plays out, one sees the two kids have no faith in him; none at all. He knows nothing about them, has never paid attention to anything about them, and feels burdened with them. Their conversions are strained and tension is always present, especially with the son.When some bizarre phenomena begins happening, it is originally thought to be the weather. Until the ground opens up, and a huge ship emerges. It is the first of many, and these machines really are frightening. Like the original film from the 1950's, they simply obliterate everything in their path, and are impervious to any Earth-launched attack. Nothing can stop them. Early on, Speilberg uses a little editing trick that a lot of film makers don't employ much any more; when people are running for their lives, the camera zooms in, giving us a close-up view of the terror these people are experiencing, as they are vaporized by the alien machines' death rays.Pertinent in this release, is when it is happening; the timing of it all. The United States, and the Western world in general, were on high alert, wondering when the next terrorist attack will happen. So, when something we can't comprehend comes out of nowhere, and starts mowing people down by the thousands, it does strike a nerve. And seeing the panic that would inevitably ensue, is quite realistic. People would act this way.The story is completely retooled, but has the same ironic message: Nature knows what's best. A virus, the common cold, which we have tried to eliminate since we knew what it was, ironically steps in, and saves us from our common enemy.There are some points of contention many people have with this film, but it is a very good one, on its own merits.",5,Wholesale slaughter never seems to go out of style,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,2132,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'remakes', 'secondly', 'think', 'CGI', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'very', 'small', 'doses', 'So', 'irony', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'remake', 'lot', 'CGI', 'yet', 'think', 'surprisingly', 'good.This', 'version', 'story', 'divorced', 'man', 'who', 'watching', 'son', 'daughter', 'time', 'alien', 'invasion', 'simply', 'can', 'NOT', 'connect', 'story', 'out', 'one', 'two', 'kids', 'have', 'faith', 'none', 'nothing', 'never', 'paid', 'attention', 'anything', 'feels', 'burdened', 'conversions', 'are', 'strained', 'tension', 'always', 'present', 'especially', 'son.When', 'bizarre', 'phenomena', 'happening', 'originally', 'thought', 'be', 'weather', 'ground', 'up', 'huge', 'ship', 'first', 'many', 'machines', 'really', 'are', 'frightening', 'original', 'film', '1950', 'simply', 'obliterate', 'everything', 'path', 'are', 'impervious', 'Earth-launched', 'attack', 'Nothing', 'can', 'stop', 'Early', 'Speilberg', 'little', 'editing', 'trick', 'lot', 'film', 'makers', 'do', ""n't"", 'employ', 'much', 'more', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'running', 'lives', 'camera', 'zooms', 'giving', 'close-up', 'view', 'terror', 'people', 'are', 'experiencing', 'are', 'vaporized', 'alien', 'machines', 'death', 'rays.Pertinent', 'release', 'when', 'happening', 'timing', 'United', 'States', 'Western', 'world', 'general', 'were', 'high', 'alert', 'wondering', 'when', 'next', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'will', 'happen', 'So', 'when', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'nowhere', 'mowing', 'people', 'down', 'thousands', 'strike', 'nerve', 'seeing', 'panic', 'would', 'inevitably', 'ensue', 'quite', 'realistic', 'People', 'would', 'act', 'way.The', 'story', 'completely', 'retooled', 'same', 'ironic', 'message', 'Nature', 'what', 'best', 'virus', 'common', 'cold', 'have', 'tried', 'eliminate', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'ironically', 'steps', 'common', 'are', 'points', 'contention', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'own', 'merits']",N/A

634935,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JNTI,Alex Udvary,"[3, 5]","Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" has been hailed as a visual feast among several critics but they have also claimed the movie has some flaws and doesn't quite live up to what Spielberg has done in the past. They are right, but I can not think of a movie I've seen all year that has held my interest so. Here is a movie that literally had me on the edge of my seat throughout its entire lenght.Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier a dock worker who has been divorced from his wife Marry Ann (Miranda Otto) and is suppose to take his two children Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning) for the weekend while Marry goes off with her new husband to Boston to visit her mother.Ray is not to be confused with father of the year. As soon as Ray sees his children the audience understands his relationship with his children. Robbie just avoids him and when Rachel tries to pick up her suitcase Ray doesn't even offer to help. Instead her mother, who is expecting, carries the luggage in the house and up the stairs to her room.Soon there are TV reports of almost earthquake like ruptures happening in various parts of the world. And before we know it a violent thunderstorm hits New Jersey. At first Ray thinks it is exciting to watch but soon it becomes all too violent and everyone realizes they are under attack. By what they do not know.Here the movie reflects an all too real reality. Anyone who watches those beginning attacks scenes and does not think of 9/11 simply doesn't have a brain. The movie at this points is chilling. I had goosebumps running up and down my arms. Characters start screaming ""is it a terrorist attack!""For the moment I think it is important that we take some time out a think why exactly Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, who both worked on ""Minority Report"" decided to remake this H.G. Wells story. Is it not odd that we are at war currently? I heard Tim Robbins, who has a brief role as Ogilvy, a crazed survivior, on the Today Show, when asked ""why do the aliens attack Earth?"" Robbins just smiled and said ""yes, why would a country attack another?""I'm not suggesting it was Wells intention, but in today's world its hard not to see political connections to the story. But that is not to say it is impossible.I'm sure a large part of the audience really doesn't care about these connections. They are merely going to see the movie to have a good time. But lets discuss some of the film's flaws.The first thing I noticed about this film is the fact that the special effects seem to come before the characters. A lot of you may think so what? When I go see a Steven Spielberg film I don't care about acting or story. I'm just interested in the effects. First of all you are short changing Spielberg. I'm not even a real fan of his work. But I have to admit his films never tend to put the actors behind the effects. The reason films such as ""Minority Report"", ""E.T."" or ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" seemed to work so well with audiences is because Spielberg blends the two together. Both elements are equally important. I didn't feel that way with this movie. The thing that caught my eye most was not the acting but the effects. It is the background that we keep our eyes on. Not Tom Cruise in the middle of it.The second flaw of the film is the fact that very little happens. The audience, just like the characters in the film, have to wait from moment to moment as the aliens attack. Nothing really important happens inbetween the attacks. We just sit and wait. After a while, if you try and distance yourself from the movie and be objective, you may become a little tired of it. After the first attack little else could shock us. It all just repeats itself.And last I found the acting by the children annoying. All they do is complain and scream at their father as the world around them is being attacked. They keep asking him what is going on. Why can't they JUST OPEN THEIR EYES! Look around, why are you acting so dumb. And the son, G-d help him! I never saw a character that seemed so eager to get killed. The son actually wants to go and fight the aliens. In movies such as these I always find it funny that some people actually think they can shoot at anything and thats exactly what Robbie wants to do. Why do people think guns are always the answer. The ""thing"" that is attacking them is clearly not human but does that stop anyone from shooting? No way!But despite all of this ""War of the Worlds"" is still a movie to see. It is an excellent example of pure popcorn entertainment (if you want it to be, but as I said it could be much more). It is my answer to people who write to me and tell me I'm too picky. That I always need Ingmar Bergmen to please me. This may not be Spielberg's best film but it is a rousing adventure that takes its audience on one wild ride. *** 1/2 out of *****Bottom-line: Not Steven Spielberg's best film and it doesn't quite make the impact that could have been made in our current times but it is an exciting ride with amazing visual effects.",3,A little too Close of an Encounter,1120176000,"07 1,

It has some great moments, some very cool special effects, the action starts almost right away, there are some great ""human"" emotion moments in it. BUT there are way too many moments where you just say ""Oh you have got to be kidding!"" Aside from being attacked by aliens Tom Cruise's character seems to have greatest luck in the world. He needs a car to get out of town? Lucky for him he finds the only one! After an attack where the house he's hiding out in is leveled (along with every other house on the street) with airplane debris and such, guess what? That mini van he used is unscratched and ready to go! And when his son.......oh wait, I won't give that part away.Great special effects, Dakota Fanning is great, some great intense moments, but a lot of stuff that is surprisingly bad for a Spielberg film.

Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, Steven ""I Know Better Than H.G. Wells"" Spielberg missed on every other mark.Generally books do not translate well into movies.  They have to be shortened lest their movie counterparts be six hours long, and changes have to be made to the plot in order to accommodate the shortening.  This is to be expected.But Spielberg has altered the plot of ""War of the Worlds"" to the point that it is virtually unrecognizable.  A few scenes vaguely resemble what H.G. Wells wrote, but in concept only--the destruction of a boat, the main character(s) being holed up with a madman, and the eventual death of the Martians.I will not bore you with a complete list of the many (needless) deviations from H.G. Wells' work, but I will say this:By altering the arrival of the Martians (and for no good reason, either; if you watch the ""making of"" featurette available on the DVD, you learn that his reasoning was essentially, ""because I felt like it""), introduced a couple of glaring plotholes:1.  If the Martians were here millions of years ago, why didn't they just take the planet then?2.  If the Martians were here millions of years ago, then why didn't they know about the bacteria?Worse still, the plot introduced by Spielberg to take the place of Wells' makes very little sense.  Again, why didn't the Martians just take the planet all those millions of years ago?  Again, why didn't they know about the bacteria?  If the Tripods have force-fields (a cheesy science fiction staple I really wish people would stop using), then why can people run underneath them?  Why did we never find a Tripod?  And what in the world was the bit about the electrical storm sapping power from everybody?  And so on.And don't even get me started on the dialogue!Much in the same way Andrew Douglas recently turned of America's most pervasive haunted house stories (Amityville), and a cult classic, into a cheesy daddy-goes-crazy slasher, Spielberg took one of the masterpieces of science fiction and transformed it into a cheesy end-of-the-world horror.Don't fix what ain't broke.",2,Two stars for the excellent Tripods.,1189468800,"09 11, 2007",2007,2226,"['Not', 'only', 'design', 'Tripods', 'fantastic', 'menacing', 'something', 'other', 'War', 'Worlds', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'claim', 'Unfortunately', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Steven', 'Know', 'Better', 'Than', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Spielberg', 'missed', 'other', 'mark.Generally', 'books', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'movies', 'have', 'be', 'shortened', 'lest', 'movie', 'counterparts', 'be', 'six', 'hours', 'long', 'changes', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'plot', 'order', 'accommodate', 'shortening', 'be', 'expected.But', 'Spielberg', 'altered', 'plot', 'War', 'Worlds', 'point', 'virtually', 'unrecognizable', 'few', 'scenes', 'vaguely', 'resemble', 'what', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'wrote', 'concept', 'only', 'destruction', 'boat', 'main', 'character', 's', 'being', 'holed', 'up', 'madman', 'eventual', 'death', 'Martians.I', 'will', 'not', 'bore', 'complete', 'list', 'many', 'needless', 'deviations', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'work', 'will', 'say', 'altering', 'arrival', 'Martians', 'good', 'reason', 'either', 'watch', 'making', 'featurette', 'available', 'DVD', 'learn', 'reasoning', 'was', 'essentially', 'felt', 'introduced', 'couple', 'glaring', 'plotholes:1', 'Martians', 'were', 'here', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'planet', 'then', '2', 'Martians', 'were', 'here', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'bacteria', 'Worse', 'still', 'plot', 'introduced', 'Spielberg', 'take', 'place', 'Wells', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'Again', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Martians', 'just', 'take', 'planet', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'Again', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'bacteria', 'Tripods', 'have', 'force-fields', 'cheesy', 'science', 'fiction', 'staple', 'really', 'wish', 'people', 'would', 'stop', 'using', 'then', 'why', 'can', 'people', 'run', 'Why', 'did', 'never', 'find', 'Tripod', 'what', 'world', 'was', 'bit', 'electrical', 'storm', 'sapping', 'power', 'everybody', 'so', 'on.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'dialogue', 'Much', 'same', 'way', 'Andrew', 'Douglas', 'recently', 'turned', 'America', 'most', 'pervasive', 'haunted', 'house', 'stories', 'Amityville', 'cult', 'classic', 'cheesy', 'daddy-goes-crazy', 'slasher', 'Spielberg', 'took', 'one', 'masterpieces', 'science', 'fiction', 'transformed', 'cheesy', 'end-of-the-world', 'horror.Do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'what', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke']",N/A
634938,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B00005JNTI,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[0, 0]","Thank heavens we rented this movie on VHS tape, rather than paying a fortune in a movie theater. I was bored from the get go, and it was torture to watch until the end. Something, I figured, would have to happen. But it didn't.The script is just plain stupid. It reminded me of one of those badly-made black and white 1950s science fiction films (complete with the '50s sci-fi narrator at the beginning and end.) It was certainly just as dumb, and a lot more of a snore. If you want to know how much of a snore, keep reading.Ray (Tom Cruise) is a blue-collar dad working in a grimy industrial town somewhere south of Boston. (The opening, in fact, was shot in a grimy New Jersey town--Bayonne--near the crossing to Staten Island.) Ray is rushing to get off from work and refuses to take overtime, although his boss is in a pinch. Nothing likable or unique about him.He arrives home to find his pregnant ex-wife waiting with her new husband and Ray's son and daughter in tow. He's late. His ex takes Rachel's (Dakota Fanning) suitcase upstairs and makes faces and noises about the messy state of the house. Ray's son has a paper due on Monday. Father and son play some ball and smash a window. There's a strange lightning storm reported on TV from Ukraine. Ray tells the kids to order dinner out, goes to sleep and wakes up to find they've eaten organic health food for supper.The next thing you know, Ray's son has driven off with his car and a lightning storm is hitting Bayonne. Ray tells Rachel to stay in the house while he looks for his son. Lightning vaporizes some people, a huge crowd gathers across from the local church, a hole opens in the ground, the church crumbles, the ground cracks and the cracks keep expanding. Ray runs, only to see a tripod rising from the ground behind him, vaporizing more people as he hides behind buildings and makes his way home. All the electrical appliances, phones and cars have gone dead. Ray finds his son, but his car has gone dead, too.All this takes maybe 15 minutes--which is 15 minutes too long.Ray tells his kids to pack some food, and they steal a van. Why it runs when no other cars are running is left to our imagination. But never mind. Our heroes need an escape. So off they go to his ex-wife's house--until the next day. Then the tripods vaporize that too. There's a brief explanation when a news crew shows up in another working van--also unexplained--and miraculously have video tapes of tripods terrorizing cities and causing mayhem around the globe.Now Ray grabs his inexplicably-working-car, piles the kids in, and heads off on the back roads towards Boston. Mobs of frightened people with no transportation of their own smash the windshield and steal the stolen car. Ray's interest in his children's safety is supposed to be intense, but he shows that with a lot of yelling, hysteria and bad acting. Dakota Fanning also screams a lot.Ray and his kids make their way through a mob onto an overcrowded ferry to escape as more tripods appear. Then a tripod rises out of the water, capsizing the vessel. Ray and his kids miraculously swim to shore, dry off and find shelter in a farmhouse basement owned by a lunatic farmer (Tim Robbins). You get the boring picture.From this point on, the film gets mildly interesting, thanks to some special effects. But there's still no action, no script and no plot. During several more boring minutes, for example, a tripod arm searches inside the basement while Ray, his kids and the crazy farmer hide. How suspenseful.I won't spoil the ending, except to say that it, too, is stupid beyond belief. The movie just ends.Really. Ladies and gentlemen, this film is a dog --- and that's unkind to dogs.Steven Spielberg bombed. There's one good thing, though. Aside from the painful two hours and some minutes, watching it only cost me $3. With shipping, buying a DVD, even for 42 cents, still costs too much. Skip it.--Alyssa A.

634940,AC7J2CCGFQXY9,B00005JNTI,"Amazon Customer ""fairytales&dreams""","[3, 5]","When this movie first came out in movie theatres, I liked it so much I saw it twice!  When it finally came out on DVD I knew I had to get it.  I have watched this movie several times since, and although there are some flaws in this movie, I am able to overlook them and enjoy one of my favorite alien invasion movies.Forget about the corny Independence Day alien invasion movie, War of the Worlds doesn't showcase famous landmarks being destroyed or showing the optimism and hope of humanity battling aliens.  While that movie was entertaining, it was far less realistic and that was one reason why I liked War of the Worlds.  It had a more gritty, dark, and depressing undertone to the movie (for instance, the scene before the Hudson ferry scene with the mob surrounding the van Cruise's character, Ray, and his kids were in, very scary and realistic!).  Instead of showing multiple perspectives, in War of the Worlds, you follow one man and his children as they try to survive this disaster of apocalyptic proportions.My favorite parts of the movie was definitely the parts with the alien tripods.  I thought the huge, towering tripods were very scary with their metallic, machine sounds and the eerie, creepy trumpeting call that froze people in their tracks like deer before a car.  My favorite scene was in the beginning, when you're with Tom Cruise's character watching in shock as a huge tripod breaks out of the ground.  Simply awesome.  Another great scene is the military battle scene upon the hill when a tripod comes up out of the flames of the wreckage, or the scene where Cruise steps from the house he was hiding in to a red alien land.  Yet another great scene is the part where everyone is boarding the ferry to cross the river, one of Ray's children looks up to see trees swaying up on a hill behind the crowd.  Suddenly, a tripod appears and as one the entire crowd turns around and there's a moment of stunned silence as everyone takes in the appearance of the tripod.  Then chaos and panic breaks out right when the tripods start making their weird bellowing and trumpeting calls.While I enjoyed this movie a lot, what prevented it from being absolutely great was a few things I felt Spielberg should have done different.  The main character's son was very annoying.  I wanted to slap him upside the head for being a stupid fool wanting to go off and fight with the Army against the aliens.  He's what, a teenager in high school, and he was clueless just wanting to go off on his own.  I think the director could have portrayed the dislike between father and son differently.  He didn't have to make the son an annoying fool to the point I felt no sympathy for his character and was relieved when he didn't get screen time later.Another quibble I had was the ending of the movie.  I felt the movie ending was too happy and perfect, and didn't go well with the tone of the movie, which was very dark and despairing.  For a very realistic movie, the ending was so unrealistic it was jarring.The last annoyance I had was Spielberg's decision to show us what the aliens looked like.  If he had just shown us the alien tripods destroying cities and harvesting humans, I think that would have been enough.  Showing what operated the machine tripods disappointed me because the aliens were not frightening at all.  They seemed ordinary and so after that the tripods didn't seem as scary as they did before seeing what the aliens looked like.  By showing us the aliens, I felt Spielberg took away from the creepiness and mystery surrounding the alien tripods.Yet, I think if you can overlook those flaws, the movie is still quite enjoyable to watch.

634943,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B00005JNTI,Amazon Customer,"[3, 8]","I had a lot of trepidation about seeing this film.  Many of the reviews that came out when it was first released did not lead me to believe this was a very good adaptation of H. G. Wells science fiction classic, and if you're a Wells traditionalist then you will agree with them.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a film that takes a classic science fiction story and updates it to a 21st century, post September 11 world, this is the film for you.  There are real moments when this film is downright terrifying.  Scenes in which people are running down a street as one of the Martian machines rises above them reminds one too much of the pictures we've all seen of the attacks on the World Trade Center.  It's hard not to be emotional.  Some might find fault with that.  Fault Stephen Spielberg for setting the film in New York City and creating scenes that remind us so much of that terrible day, but I think it lends a hard-core emotion to the film.While the film is non-stop action and terror from the moment the machines appear I have to say this is probably the most viscerally emotional film Tom Cruise has ever done.  As a dead-beat dad who's rarely in his children's lives he has to step up and not only face this horrific terror, but also be the father his children need.  And the kids are just fantastic.  I often feel like Dakota Fanning is getting way too much exposure these days.  I mean, is she the only child actor out there!?  However, in this film she shows the kind of acting chops most adults would envy.  You really feel the terror of this child as she faces world-changing events.  Then here is Justin Chatwin, simply fantastic as Cruise's teenage son, who wants nothing more than to seek revenge against the machine that have attacked his world and killed millions.  The range of emotion he shows is palpable on the screen.  The most heart-wrenching scene in the movie, I think, is when Cruise's character must finally let his son go, let him discover for himself all the horrific events he, as if father, has been trying to protect him from.  In a sense he has to let his son become a man.It's not often you find such emotional baggage in a science fiction film, but that's where it hues closely to Wells' classic.  If you've ever read the novel, and if you haven't you should, Wells is very good at making you feel the terror of an alien invasion.  While Spielberg and company have certainly taken creative license with some aspects, they have kept the human drama intact.  For that reason, this version of War of the Worlds earns high praise from me.  It takes back Wells' classic novel from the campy 1950s film.  If you normally skip Tom Cruise films, then you need to pick this one up.  You won't be sorry.",4,Wow!,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2744,"['had', 'lot', 'trepidation', 'seeing', 'film', 'Many', 'reviews', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'did', 'not', 'lead', 'believe', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'science', 'fiction', 'classic', ""'re"", 'Wells', 'traditionalist', 'then', 'will', 'agree', 'other', 'hand', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', '21st', 'century', 'post', 'September', '11', 'world', 'film', 'are', 'real', 'moments', 'when', 'film', 'downright', 'terrifying', 'Scenes', 'people', 'are', 'running', 'down', 'street', 'one', 'Martian', 'machines', 'rises', 'one', 'too', 'much', 'pictures', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'attacks', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'emotional', 'might', 'find', 'fault', 'Fault', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'setting', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'creating', 'scenes', 'remind', 'so', 'much', 'terrible', 'day', 'think', 'hard-core', 'emotion', 'film.While', 'film', 'non-stop', 'action', 'terror', 'moment', 'machines', 'appear', 'have', 'say', 'probably', 'most', 'viscerally', 'emotional', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'ever', 'done', 'dead-beat', 'dad', 'who', 'rarely', 'children', 'lives', 'step', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'face', 'horrific', 'terror', 'also', 'be', 'father', 'children', 'need', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'fantastic', 'often', 'feel', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'getting', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'exposure', 'days', 'mean', 'only', 'child', 'actor', 'there', 'However', 'film', 'kind', 'acting', 'chops', 'most', 'adults', 'would', 'envy', 'really', 'feel', 'terror', 'child', 'world-changing', 'events', 'Then', 'here', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'Cruise', 'teenage', 'son', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'seek', 'revenge', 'machine', 'have', 'attacked', 'world', 'killed', 'millions', 'range', 'emotion', 'palpable', 'screen', 'most', 'heart-wrenching', 'scene', 'movie', 'think', 'when', 'Cruise', 'character', 'must', 'finally', 'let', 'son', 'go', 'let', 'discover', 'horrific', 'events', 'father', 'been', 'trying', 'protect', 'sense', 'let', 'son', 'become', 'man.It', 'not', 'often', 'find', 'such', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'where', 'closely', 'Wells', 'classic', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'should', 'Wells', 'very', 'good', 'making', 'feel', 'terror', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Spielberg', 'company', 'have', 'certainly', 'taken', 'creative', 'license', 'aspects', 'have', 'kept', 'human', 'drama', 'intact', 'reason', 'version', 'War', 'Worlds', 'high', 'praise', 'back', 'Wells', 'classic', 'novel', 'campy', '1950s', 'film', 'normally', 'skip', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'films', 'then', 'need', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry']",N/A
634944,A70SVZE0SQNWH,B00005JNTI,Amazon Customer,"[4, 5]","War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg's all out big bucks summer movie starring Tom the Tooth Cruise and Dakota Fanning based on the Orson Welles' classic radio show.The special effects and loud sound track almost distract the audience from the thin story line: Tom Cruise, a good for nothing dad, getting his second chance to prove to his kids that he can be a good father while being chased and attacked by giant alien space ships that require stilts to move around instead of flying like normal space ships. The story begins with Tom's ex-wife and her new husband dropping off their two kids 10 year old Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and rebellious teenager Robbie (unknown newcomer) at Tom's messy abode. Only hours after they are dropped off, the aliens arrive from a hole in the ground. The preposterous roller coaster ride begins with Tom and a crowd of people standing around a big hole in the ground that seems to be coming alive. Onlookers point out that ""there is something under us"" and yet they stand calmly and stare at the hole. Until the earth rips itself from under their feet and then all hell breaks loose.Here Tom starts his mad dash to save his kids as big alien spaceships aim and zap at everyone in its path-- vaporizing them down to their undies.&lt;SPOILER ALERT>Ordinary Joe, Tom manages to evade the attackers, grab his kids and find the only moving vehicle the city has and be 5 steps ahead from destruction. Throughout Tom's desperate attempt to flee the city, his 10 year old daughter who seemingly had been mature beyond her years in the first few minutes of the movie, suddenly becomes a hysterical 3 year old having a hissy fit in the back of the car and crying ""I want my mommy!"" What gives?""Do you know where we're going dad?"" Rachel asks. Tom looks ahead with a crazy glassy stare ""Yeah, we're going to your mom."" Now how ridiculous is that? Is mom's place going to be the safe haven away from these scary aliens? Well I guess in Mr. Spielberg's books it is.So other crazy things happen, Tom's son decides to join the army because he ""has to see them."" And we see a huge explosion exactly in the spot where bratty son of Tom runs off too. For some reason, it feels that perhaps the director didn't have time to write the son into the rest of the story as we don't get to know much about him except for the fact that he is a dumb brat.Now Tom is off to fend for himself and his daughter. Out of the blue, a rebel without a clue, Tim Robbins arrives in the picture providing shelter in his bomb shelter only for our two stars, you guessed it, Tom and his kid. (How about the rest of the fleeing people?) Tim Robbins has a plan.. he's going to destroy the aliens, he tells Tom. He waves his weapons of choice, an axe, a rifle, and a lamp. Yup, Tom has finally found a way to save the planet.So you think they're safe but we're not left with a second of peace because now those damn aliens are not only trying to destroy the mass population, suddenly they're on a hunt for Tom to get his autograph for their Scientology scrap book. The Alien mother ship then sucks Tom up through its anus and then after realizing that its their leader Tom Cruise, spits him back out so that he can finish the picture (remember, he's making millions for every minute and dammit, there's 10 minutes left to wrap this up!)Of course while inside the mother anus, Tom manages to leave a grenade inside which in turn destroys the mother ship and for some reason, all the other alien ships destroy themselves. All hail to King of Scientology! We follow you Leader Tom!So now to the anticlimax, Tom arrives with his daughter at the home of his ex-wife's parents, and there they all are... ex-wife, her new husband, her parents and surprise surprise, super hero son who should've died 3 scenes ago. Hmmm... wouldn't it have been a more interesting picture if we could have witnessed the perspective inside the ex-wife's parents' house in Boston while the whole world was being destroyed and watch the only humans who remain unscathed by the whole ordeal?

634945,A3P2R1WF7A03V1,B00005JNTI,"Amazon Customer ""NJ Review Guy""","[3, 5]","About midway through War of the Worlds (2005) a character justly sums up the conflict in Steven Spielberg's starkly realistic update of the sci-fi classic.  Spielberg, despite his now legendary status as a world class filmmaker, can still be sometimes accused of being a bit cloying or too intent on providing family fun or frolic to his movies.  With this, Spielberg balances just the right amount of jaw dropping visuals and action with mature, real world characters.  In many ways, this is one of the most intensely powerful and disturbing science fiction films ever made.Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a dockworker from Bayonne,  NJ.  Does Cruise play a dockworker from Bayonne well?  I've lived in Bayonne for 25 years and I know some dockworkers, so yes as far as I'm concerned he does a good job of portraying a blue-collar worker from NJ.  Growing up a few blocks from the place where Spielberg would shoot some of the most incredibly effective scenes of destruction ever on film, gives a thrilling dimension to the movie that not everyone else can share.  To see the Bayonne Bridge, a monument I've traveled over dozens of times, bubble, then ripple and explode, tossing automobiles over and all around like children's toys is utterly surreal.  Computer images are truly at the stage where it's nearly impossible to distinguish digital fakery from the real thing.  When it's a magic spell gone awry by Harry Potter or a cute creature from a Pixar flick, it's delightful.  When it's in your face, savage demolition as we see here, there's something profoundly unsettling about it.  Spielberg is on record saying that with W.O.W. he wanted to capture the most frantic moments of 911.  And the movie certainly succeeds at that ramped up visual and emotional level.Dakota Fanning's portrayal of Cruise's daughter is both skillfully realized, yet retains a natural flavor characteristic of a more mature performer.  She's one of the more likeable child actors around and when she screams in terror at the horror around her, we feel it more than perhaps with any other character.  Rounding out the cast is Tim Robbins who is nearly unrecognizable as a creepy basement dweller whose rebellious nature might be applauded in a lesser film.  After Cruise and his daughter takes up refugee in the basement, Cruise must deal with a man who may be more dangerous than the alien invaders.  Here Spielberg deftly showcases what unrestrained violence and knee jerk reactionism can do in a panicked situation.  Is it a political statement?  Is Robbins some metaphor for hit them hard and hit them fast the way they did us?  I doubt Spielberg is making any overt political nod about vigilante justice or even governmental reaction to a terrorist act.  But keeping with his 911 thematic intentions, you do wonder if the Robbin's character serves to warn us that the quick answer of violence meeting violence, doesn't always serve the common good.Morgan Freeman provides a calming voice of authority and wisdom, just as  did in the original.  Fans of the classic version, may not immediately warm up to this update, however many of the same important beats are hit.  The big difference is the no holds barred realism of the production.  Spielberg has excelled at bringing us the atrocities of war, along with the human stories.  Films like Empire of the Sun and Saving Private Ryan have become standards by which many war movies are no judge.  With War of the Worlds, Spielberg has secured his place as one of the masters of science fiction films.  It may not be the most important science fiction film ever made - my vote still goes with 2001: A Space Odyssey - however it is certainly in the highest echelon.",4,"""It's not a war - it's an extermination.""",1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,3698,"['midway', 'War', 'Worlds', '2005', 'character', 'justly', 'up', 'conflict', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'starkly', 'realistic', 'update', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'Spielberg', 'now', 'legendary', 'status', 'world', 'class', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'sometimes', 'accused', 'being', 'bit', 'cloying', 'too', 'intent', 'providing', 'family', 'fun', 'frolic', 'movies', 'Spielberg', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'visuals', 'action', 'mature', 'real', 'world', 'characters', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'most', 'intensely', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'ever', 'made.Tom', 'Cruise', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'dockworker', 'Bayonne', 'NJ', 'Does', 'Cruise', 'play', 'dockworker', 'Bayonne', 'well', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Bayonne', '25', 'years', 'know', 'dockworkers', 'so', 'yes', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'blue-collar', 'worker', 'NJ', 'Growing', 'up', 'few', 'blocks', 'place', 'where', 'Spielberg', 'would', 'shoot', 'most', 'incredibly', 'effective', 'scenes', 'destruction', 'ever', 'film', 'thrilling', 'dimension', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'else', 'can', 'share', 'see', 'Bayonne', 'Bridge', 'monument', ""'ve"", 'traveled', 'dozens', 'times', 'bubble', 'then', 'ripple', 'explode', 'tossing', 'automobiles', 'children', 'toys', 'utterly', 'surreal', 'Computer', 'images', 'are', 'truly', 'stage', 'where', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'distinguish', 'digital', 'fakery', 'real', 'thing', 'When', 'magic', 'spell', 'gone', 'awry', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'cute', 'creature', 'Pixar', 'flick', 'delightful', 'When', 'face', 'savage', 'demolition', 'see', 'here', 'something', 'profoundly', 'unsettling', 'Spielberg', 'record', 'saying', 'W.O.W', 'wanted', 'capture', 'most', 'frantic', 'moments', '911', 'movie', 'certainly', 'ramped', 'up', 'visual', 'emotional', 'level.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'portrayal', 'Cruise', 'daughter', 'skillfully', 'realized', 'yet', 'natural', 'flavor', 'characteristic', 'more', 'mature', 'performer', 'one', 'more', 'likeable', 'child', 'actors', 'when', 'screams', 'terror', 'horror', 'feel', 'more', 'perhaps', 'other', 'character', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'who', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'creepy', 'basement', 'dweller', 'rebellious', 'nature', 'might', 'be', 'applauded', 'lesser', 'film', 'Cruise', 'daughter', 'up', 'refugee', 'basement', 'Cruise', 'must', 'deal', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'dangerous', 'alien', 'invaders', 'Here', 'Spielberg', 'deftly', 'what', 'unrestrained', 'violence', 'knee', 'jerk', 'reactionism', 'can', 'do', 'panicked', 'situation', 'political', 'statement', 'Robbins', 'metaphor', 'hit', 'hard', 'hit', 'fast', 'way', 'did', 'doubt', 'Spielberg', 'making', 'overt', 'political', 'nod', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'even', 'governmental', 'reaction', 'terrorist', 'act', 'keeping', '911', 'thematic', 'intentions', 'do', 'wonder', 'Robbin', 'character', 'warn', 'quick', 'answer', 'violence', 'meeting', 'violence', ""n't"", 'always', 'serve', 'common', 'good.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'calming', 'voice', 'authority', 'wisdom', 'just', 'did', 'original', 'Fans', 'classic', 'version', 'may', 'not', 'immediately', 'warm', 'up', 'update', 'however', 'many', 'same', 'important', 'beats', 'are', 'hit', 'big', 'difference', 'barred', 'realism', 'production', 'Spielberg', 'excelled', 'bringing', 'atrocities', 'war', 'human', 'stories', 'Films', 'Empire', 'Sun', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'have', 'become', 'standards', 'many', 'war', 'movies', 'are', 'judge', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Spielberg', 'secured', 'place', 'one', 'masters', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'vote', 'still', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'however', 'certainly', 'highest', 'echelon']",N/A

He comes across as semi spoiled, embittered, and something of a slob, with very little in his home or life to offer either his teenage son, or his young daughter. During there visit, everyone begins to witness what appears as a terrific thunderstorm, and with inimitable human curiosity rush to get the best view. This thunderstorm is of course the beginning on the annihilation of mankind, under the direction of a huge Martian fleet of super vehicular tripods, and as everyone flees, we stay focused and Cruise and families escape efforts. Spielberg really does a great job with atmosphere, and real tension in the terror that begins to unfold, but it's not all CGI and blue screen. The balance of shattered human lives, anger, despair, irrationality and disbelief are almost tangible as you watch, and Cruise delivers an island of drama amidst the ocean of destruction. It's worth mentioning here the supporting cast who are great, particularly young Dakota Fanning as Rachel, and Tim Robbins as an underground survivor who has really gone off the deep end mentally, but helps the trio during their escape.I thoroughly recommend this movie, even if like me you have seen the original, read the book, or have the T-shirt!

The mood and atmosphere of most scenes is very apocalyptic.*Great style with some fascinating, memorable imagery (such as the scene where everybody's clothes are falling from the sky...).*Straightforward story that effectively incorporates elements from other film variations and the original novel.*Some people hate the ending, but I don't see how it's any different from the original book.*Despite Tom Cruise's questionable acting quality, he managed to make a realistic, dramatic character.  The other actors are not bad.*One or two touching or heart-wrentching moments (although this could also be bad, because it can be seen as sappy).  I was particuarly impressed by one scene in the middle of the movie, where everybody is fighting among themselves, and showing a brutal side to humanity.*Although I failed to catch onto it, others have noted an interesting paralellism to the modern-day war in Iraq.The Bad Things*Despite the quality of the special effects, there really isn't much action.*The characters have some annoying moments.*Could care less about the music (sorry John Williams...).I was generally impressed by this version of the story.  Instead of being a shallow overloaded blockbuster (like ""ID4""), this is a stylish thriller with lots of suspense.  There were one or two scenes that showed a dark, bleak side to humanity, and I found it very deep and fascinating.  Even if the characters are annoying, they come out all right in the end.

634948,A928WN8NV03WZ,B00005JNTI,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[3, 6]","I will start out by saying that I am neither a Tom Cruise fan, nor really a Spielberg fan. But after this movie, I am willing to say, it was well done and well acted.  This is a slight modernization of the tale that was originally set in turn of the century Britain.Now it starts in New York, with a dockworker Ray Ferrier(Tom Cruise).  He comes off as a bit of an overgrown adolescent.  He is cocky and arrogant at work, despite his low position.  He is divorced and has his son and daughter for the weekend.  The meetings with the mother don't go well, and the impression is that only the daughter wants to be there.  When he awakens from a nap he finds that there is very strange weather.  After lightening strikes the same place repeatedly he goes out to see what happened.  That is where the tripod rises and starts killing.  He then must grab his family and make a mad dash for his ex wife's in boston.This movie, though making some changes follows the heart of the book.  It wasn't about a real war, it was about the invasion and massacre of the human race.  You don't see a lot of the aliens, and the images are usually fleeting.  Making them more interesting as villians, they have no clear agenda, they just rise and exterminate anything in their path.  Left out is how they arrive.  There are some vague references to the machines being buried then retrieved, but nothing is proven, just that it has something to do with the lightening.Most of the focus is on the main character(Cruise) and his interaction with his family as he tries to flee the invaders.  He puts on a good performance as an unwilling father and comes acoss as a bit of a loser.  He has a messy house with car parts in the living room he is working on.  He has an obviously failed marriage.  The wife having moved on to a stable and successful man he is jealous of.  His kids don't think much of him, and seem think of their time with him as a chore.  His only idea is to flee to Boston to find his ex wife and their mother so won't have to deal with the kids.  It is obvious he doesn't know how to deal with his eccentric daughter(dakota fanning) or his resentful son(Justin Chatwin).This doesn't feel like the typical family friendly fare that Spielberg is known for.  The violene, though sparce doesn't pull any punches and gives you the feel of panic as these mysterious entities move in and destroy anyone in their path.  The Martians use tripods similar to the books.  They are well designed and have an mysterious and alien design apparent in them.The acting is suprisingly good.  Many have said now that Tom Cruise is crazy, he has become a good actor.  Comparing this to other films I have sen him in, I would have to agree. As well as one excellent cameo.All in all this is a good adaptation of the HG Wells story.  The changes are minor, and more to reflect that this is a different age than it was originally written.  This is not an action movie.  It is more of a disaster piece, with the disaster fueling what is going on, but the focus is on character interaction.  All in all though a well made movie that covers a broad ranges of tastes and should have something to make the average movie watcher happy.",4,Good retelling of the classic tale,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,3200,"['will', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'am', 'neither', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'fan', 'really', 'Spielberg', 'fan', 'movie', 'am', 'willing', 'say', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'acted', 'slight', 'modernization', 'tale', 'was', 'originally', 'set', 'turn', 'century', 'Britain.Now', 'New', 'York', 'dockworker', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'off', 'bit', 'overgrown', 'adolescent', 'cocky', 'arrogant', 'work', 'low', 'position', 'divorced', 'son', 'daughter', 'weekend', 'meetings', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'impression', 'only', 'daughter', 'be', 'there', 'When', 'nap', 'very', 'strange', 'weather', 'lightening', 'strikes', 'same', 'place', 'repeatedly', 'out', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'where', 'tripod', 'killing', 'then', 'must', 'grab', 'family', 'make', 'mad', 'dash', 'ex', 'wife', 'boston.This', 'movie', 'making', 'changes', 'heart', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'war', 'was', 'invasion', 'massacre', 'human', 'race', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'aliens', 'images', 'are', 'usually', 'fleeting', 'Making', 'more', 'interesting', 'villians', 'have', 'clear', 'agenda', 'just', 'rise', 'exterminate', 'anything', 'path', 'Left', 'out', 'how', 'arrive', 'are', 'vague', 'references', 'machines', 'being', 'buried', 'then', 'retrieved', 'nothing', 'proven', 'just', 'something', 'do', 'lightening.Most', 'focus', 'main', 'character', 'Cruise', 'interaction', 'family', 'flee', 'invaders', 'good', 'performance', 'unwilling', 'father', 'acoss', 'bit', 'loser', 'messy', 'house', 'car', 'parts', 'living', 'room', 'working', 'obviously', 'failed', 'marriage', 'wife', 'having', 'moved', 'stable', 'successful', 'man', 'jealous', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'seem', 'think', 'time', 'chore', 'only', 'idea', 'flee', 'Boston', 'find', 'ex', 'wife', 'mother', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'kids', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'eccentric', 'daughter', 'dakota', 'fanning', 'resentful', 'son', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', '.This', ""n't"", 'feel', 'typical', 'family', 'friendly', 'fare', 'Spielberg', 'known', 'violene', 'sparce', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'feel', 'panic', 'mysterious', 'entities', 'move', 'destroy', 'anyone', 'path', 'Martians', 'use', 'tripods', 'similar', 'books', 'are', 'well', 'designed', 'have', 'mysterious', 'alien', 'design', 'apparent', 'them.The', 'acting', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'Many', 'have', 'said', 'now', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'crazy', 'become', 'good', 'actor', 'Comparing', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'sen', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'As', 'well', 'one', 'excellent', 'cameo.All', 'good', 'adaptation', 'HG', 'Wells', 'story', 'changes', 'are', 'minor', 'more', 'reflect', 'different', 'age', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'more', 'disaster', 'piece', 'disaster', 'fueling', 'what', 'going', 'focus', 'character', 'interaction', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'broad', 'ranges', 'tastes', 'should', 'have', 'something', 'make', 'average', 'movie', 'watcher', 'happy']",N/A

It sits in a pantheon of works such as ""The Time Machine"" also by Wells, ""Day of the Triffids"" by John Wyndham and Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"".Steven Spielberg's current film of ""War of the Worlds"" is a sterling attempt to bring the mastery of Wells to the silver screen.  Unfortunately, Spielberg's best efforts not with standing, the film falls short of the literary efforts of Wells.  There can be no doubt that Spielberg is the absolute master of special effects.  The arrival of the first aliens is truly spell binding.  However, as the film progresses, the viewer is progressively less captivated by Spielberg's efforts.  There are only so many special effects to be had before fatigue arrives.Yet defence of the film is possible.  Spielberg uses effects that invoke images of New York on 11 September and the more recent events in London.  Terror thus has a new face and the terror of aliens is absolute in that they truly rule the world for a period of time.However, overall, I found the film passable at best.

If so, then why do they spray it back on the ground????3. WHY OH WHY did the Martians just SUDDENLY DIED??? This made the least sense to me. Did they get killed by something or did the weapons kill them?4. What are the birds doing and how is that significant??? What do Cruise mean by ""no shields???""

634958,ASP6GYZPZ3FE0,B00005JNTI,"Anthony Ian ""anthony_ian""","[9, 12]","I have always been a fan of the alien-invasion genre, and have long awaited a decent movie to exploit the subject.  Independence Day was a joke; Signs was great until the preposterous ending and explanation of what did in the aliens; X-Files had a good tone and smart plotting, until they lost everyone with the whole bees-and-corn storyline.  Huh?When I saw that Speilberg was going to tackle this with Cruise in the lead, I couldn't wait.  And you know what, I wasn't disappointed.First things first: the plot, as Ebert pointed out, about where they come from, is illogical, yes.  But once you see the first machine literally explode onto that small town, it sure won't matter, because it's creepy as hell.  Once one of these things stands up and starts making all the ominous noises while everybody just stands there, you can't help but be rattled.There's a nifty and creepy sequence right before about a sort-of lightning storm--but with no thunder, as Ray points out, and the wind blowing TOWARDS the storm and not away from it.  Next thing everybody knows, all electrical devices are dead: cars, power, even Ray's watch.  Nice setup for obviously impending doom.Of course this is CGI at work and I always appreciate digital that's done so realistically you forget it's digital.  And that is the case here (unlike, say, the embarassingly digital snake in the movie Anaconda).Once the machine starts going on a rampage in that New Jersey town, it is frightening and freaky and for whatever anybody says, Cruise does a good job of downplaying the role throughout--he's not the hero who does in the beast but rather a sad father who's just trying to keep his two kids alive.The the other big plus for the movie is how it portrays what monsters WE become in the face of catastrophes on this scale--the panic, the me-first mentality, the trampling over others, etc.  There's a great scene when Ray and his kids--in a working car, which nobody has--is set upon by a mob that attacks them viciously.  A mob of fellow Americans.What's best about the movie is the horrific imagery: people covered in ash from you-don't-want-to-know-what, a downed airliner, a burning train speeding through a town, the mist of blood blowing in a window, the source of which becomes horribly apparent.  Yes, there are obvious reminders of 9/11 from not only the destruction and the ash but the aftermath.The downside to the movie was too often the carnage and action was immediately followed by what seemed like overlong drama pieces intercut throughout.  Of course you need a ""human"" story to it lest it become a cartoon like ID4, but these were the only sequences that dragged.Cruise underplays it nicely, Dakota Fanning is great as always and the kid who plays Ray's conflicted teenage son is quite a find.  You even get to see Tim Robbins as a crazy guy in a tornado shelter who meets a fate you won't believe.Best Spielberg movie ever?  No.  But definitely worth seeing, especially when the machines are wreaking havoc.  They are quite horrifying to behold, especially the first one.DEFINITELY worth a rent.",3,"It Has Its Problems, But It Gets Away With Them With Awesome Visuals",1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,3090,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'alien-invasion', 'genre', 'have', 'long', 'awaited', 'decent', 'movie', 'exploit', 'subject', 'Independence', 'Day', 'was', 'joke', 'Signs', 'was', 'great', 'preposterous', 'ending', 'explanation', 'what', 'did', 'aliens', 'X-Files', 'had', 'good', 'tone', 'smart', 'plotting', 'lost', 'everyone', 'whole', 'bees-and-corn', 'storyline', 'Huh', 'When', 'saw', 'Speilberg', 'was', 'going', 'tackle', 'Cruise', 'lead', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'know', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed.First', 'things', 'first', 'plot', 'Ebert', 'pointed', 'out', 'about', 'where', 'come', 'illogical', 'yes', 'once', 'see', 'first', 'machine', 'literally', 'explode', 'small', 'town', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'creepy', 'hell', 'Once', 'one', 'things', 'up', 'starts', 'making', 'ominous', 'noises', 'everybody', 'just', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'nifty', 'creepy', 'sequence', 'right', 'sort-of', 'lightning', 'storm', 'thunder', 'Ray', 'out', 'wind', 'blowing', 'TOWARDS', 'storm', 'not', 'away', 'Next', 'thing', 'everybody', 'electrical', 'devices', 'are', 'dead', 'cars', 'power', 'even', 'Ray', 'watch', 'Nice', 'setup', 'obviously', 'impending', 'doom.Of', 'course', 'CGI', 'work', 'always', 'appreciate', 'digital', 'done', 'so', 'realistically', 'forget', 'digital', 'case', 'here', 'say', 'embarassingly', 'digital', 'snake', 'movie', 'Anaconda', '.Once', 'machine', 'going', 'rampage', 'New', 'Jersey', 'town', 'frightening', 'freaky', 'anybody', 'Cruise', 'good', 'job', 'downplaying', 'role', 'not', 'hero', 'who', 'beast', 'rather', 'sad', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'keep', 'two', 'kids', 'alive.The', 'other', 'big', 'plus', 'movie', 'how', 'what', 'WE', 'become', 'face', 'catastrophes', 'scale', 'panic', 'me-first', 'mentality', 'trampling', 'others', 'etc', 'great', 'scene', 'when', 'Ray', 'kids', 'working', 'car', 'nobody', 'set', 'mob', 'viciously', 'mob', 'fellow', 'Americans.What', 'best', 'movie', 'horrific', 'imagery', 'people', 'covered', 'ash', ""you-don't-want-to-know-what"", 'downed', 'airliner', 'burning', 'train', 'speeding', 'town', 'mist', 'blood', 'blowing', 'window', 'source', 'horribly', 'apparent', 'Yes', 'are', 'obvious', 'reminders', '9/11', 'not', 'only', 'destruction', 'ash', 'aftermath.The', 'downside', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'often', 'carnage', 'action', 'was', 'immediately', 'followed', 'what', 'seemed', 'overlong', 'drama', 'pieces', 'intercut', 'course', 'need', 'human', 'story', 'lest', 'become', 'cartoon', 'ID4', 'were', 'only', 'sequences', 'dragged.Cruise', 'nicely', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'great', 'always', 'kid', 'who', 'Ray', 'conflicted', 'teenage', 'son', 'quite', 'find', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'crazy', 'guy', 'tornado', 'shelter', 'who', 'fate', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe.Best', 'Spielberg', 'movie', 'ever', 'No', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'especially', 'when', 'machines', 'are', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'are', 'quite', 'horrifying', 'behold', 'especially', 'first', 'one.DEFINITELY', 'rent']",N/A
634959,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00005JNTI,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[2, 4]","Now, I watched this movie having never read the original masterpiece (to book lovers out there, I'm sorry) or having never seen all of the original film. And to be honest, I don't feel cheated in any way. From what I've heard and learned, this version of the War of Worlds doesn't follow the book as precisely as the original movie did, but isn't that better? They used the ideas in the book while making this movie, but weren't restricted by the strict guidelines like, say, Peter Jackson had been in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Plus, despite never having read or seen the originals, I still know a lot of what happens in both, like the ending.With that out of the way, I'll go on to my review of the movie. Firstly, it starts out with narration by Morgan Freeman, and who out there doesn't like Morgan Freeman. He introduces the more scientific part of the story and, likewise, leads us out of the story at the end of the movie. After that, the action starts relatively quick, spurring the three main characters into action while also introducing us to the horrible threat that has come to there world and ruined everything they held dear.The creatures themselves are probably as scary as one could make them in such a saturated market as this one, what with all those other sci-fi alien creatures out there. Spielberg did well in this by making them solely as killing machines. We never know why they came to Earth, what their motives are for Earth, or anything. All we know is that humanity is in their way and they have all intentions of getting them out of the way.We're also forced to agonize over Tom Cruise's character, who is obviously a terrible father. He's forced into a situation where, as a loner, he has to learn to protect those who depend on him. It works out in a weird way that he ends up depending more on them. Without spoiling the movie much, a lot of his decisions cannot be made without his daughter or son as backup to these decisions.Somewhere near the middle of the movie, we are introduced to the human threat, those loonies who were obviously affected by the goings-on around them, but in a different, more psychological way. This is when the movie is its scariest, as the heroes must deal with the continuing threat of the aliens while worrying about the psychos.The ending is also well done, a kind of coming together of all the elements of the story into one heartfelt moment. Not only that, but the inevitable defeat of the aliens is a thrilling moment, especially if you have a patriotic heart.Other pluses include the classic horror soundtrack, great special effects, top-notch acting by all the actors, and a terrifying setting that continues to get creepier and creepier.Negatives: While there are few, I do have some gripes with this movie. Firstly, it seems to slow down a bit towards the middle of the story. Secondly, the ending is abrupt and, despite already knowing ahead of time, a little disappointing. Let's just say the ending isn't as Hollywood as I like in my movies (it would have been an excellent ending in a book, however; man, I really should read the War of the Worlds). Lastly, the Tim Robbins character, to me at least, seemed a little too exaggerated at times, and under-played at others, almost as if he never quite got the hang of the character he was playing (even though it's a near direct copy of his Mystic River character).I'd recommend this for anyone who enjoys the War of the Worlds universe. You can't go wrong with this interpretation of the classic book. It has excellent acting, Morgan Freeman, and a growing sense of fear and panic. While not perfect, it's still a decent sci-fi horror film.",3,War of the Worlds VS War of the Worlds VS War of the Worlds,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,3668,"['Now', 'watched', 'movie', 'having', 'never', 'read', 'original', 'masterpiece', 'book', 'lovers', 'there', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cheated', 'way', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'learned', 'version', 'War', 'Worlds', ""n't"", 'follow', 'book', 'as', 'precisely', 'original', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'better', 'used', 'ideas', 'book', 'making', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'restricted', 'strict', 'guidelines', 'say', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'had', 'been', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'never', 'having', 'read', 'seen', 'originals', 'still', 'know', 'lot', 'what', 'ending.With', 'way', ""'ll"", 'go', 'review', 'movie', 'Firstly', 'out', 'narration', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'there', ""n't"", 'like', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'more', 'scientific', 'part', 'story', 'likewise', 'story', 'end', 'movie', 'action', 'relatively', 'quick', 'spurring', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'action', 'also', 'introducing', 'horrible', 'threat', 'come', 'world', 'ruined', 'everything', 'held', 'dear.The', 'creatures', 'are', 'probably', 'as', 'scary', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'saturated', 'market', 'one', 'what', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'alien', 'creatures', 'out', 'there', 'Spielberg', 'did', 'well', 'making', 'solely', 'killing', 'machines', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'came', 'Earth', 'what', 'motives', 'are', 'Earth', 'anything', 'know', 'humanity', 'way', 'have', 'intentions', 'getting', 'way.We', ""'re"", 'also', 'forced', 'agonize', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'who', 'obviously', 'terrible', 'father', 'forced', 'situation', 'where', 'loner', 'learn', 'protect', 'who', 'depend', 'out', 'weird', 'way', 'up', 'depending', 'more', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'much', 'lot', 'decisions', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'daughter', 'son', 'backup', 'decisions.Somewhere', 'middle', 'movie', 'are', 'introduced', 'human', 'threat', 'loonies', 'who', 'were', 'obviously', 'affected', 'goings-on', 'different', 'more', 'psychological', 'way', 'when', 'movie', 'scariest', 'heroes', 'must', 'deal', 'continuing', 'threat', 'aliens', 'worrying', 'psychos.The', 'ending', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'kind', 'coming', 'together', 'elements', 'story', 'one', 'heartfelt', 'moment', 'Not', 'only', 'inevitable', 'defeat', 'aliens', 'thrilling', 'moment', 'especially', 'have', 'patriotic', 'heart.Other', 'pluses', 'include', 'classic', 'horror', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'actors', 'terrifying', 'setting', 'get', 'creepier', 'creepier.Negatives', 'are', 'few', 'do', 'have', 'gripes', 'movie', 'Firstly', 'slow', 'down', 'bit', 'middle', 'story', 'Secondly', 'ending', 'abrupt', 'already', 'knowing', 'ahead', 'time', 'little', 'disappointing', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'ending', ""n't"", 'as', 'Hollywood', 'like', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'ending', 'book', 'however', 'man', 'really', 'should', 'read', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Lastly', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'least', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'exaggerated', 'times', 'under-played', 'others', 'almost', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'hang', 'character', 'was', 'playing', 'even', 'near', 'direct', 'copy', 'Mystic', 'River', 'character', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'War', 'Worlds', 'universe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'interpretation', 'classic', 'book', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'growing', 'sense', 'fear', 'panic', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'decent', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'film']",N/A

If you're looking for a movie with a message, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for special effects & excitement then grab your seat and get ready for a wild ride.Let's start with what's good here. The special effects are outstanding, as you would expect from a big budgeted Speilberg film. The action is non-stop and at times even gut-wrenching. Tom Cruise is not the best actor in the world but he can pull this type of role off well. The images we're treated to on their trek to Boston are, at times, heart stopping. And the scene with the crazed survivor, played wonderfully by Tim Robbins, has you on the edge of your seat.In fact, I pretty much enjoyed myself all through this movie until the end. Having read the book, listen to replays of the old Orson Wells broadcast, and watch the Gene Barry version many times, I knew how it ended. I was expecting the ending. But there are two problems with the final 6-7 minutes. One, the way the defeat of the aliens was portrayed is anti-climatic at best. We're treated to 115 minutes of non-stop action only to have a 3 minute resolution. This could have been done SO much better. But what really ruined the ending was the ""reunion"" scene. After witnessing the destruction of New York and the carnage in the countryside we see the arrival in Boston to find the aliens have pretty much wiped it out as well. But after the alien death scene amid the ruin and destruction of the city we watch Dad & daughter walk up to an un-touched building where the mom has been waiting. The lights still work, all the windows are perfectly intact. It must be the only building on the eastern seaboard to escape damage. Mom runs out looking like nothing major happened. The grandparents stand behind like they just got up from the dinnertable. The ending is So darn simplistic it absolutely dropped like a thud. I mean grandpa (played by Gene Barry) is wearing a sweater and looks like he just got up out of an easy chair from reading the paper for heavens sake. Were they not aware that during the past week the world was being wiped out? It looked so out of place. Very disappointing!Again, don't look for too much here.

Mesa,"[1, 3]","Tons of reviews have already pointed out blatant plot holes and events in the film that just made you go hmmmm that I will skip over...As a child, the H.G. Wells novel was my first introduction to the world of sci-fi as well as the original 1953 film version; I give great thanks and praise to both the novelist and the director of the 50's cinematic original (and a revolutionary filmmaking original it certainly was) with Gene Barry and Ann Robinson...The alien creature design and CGI treatment absolutely says Spielberg in this 21st century, 2005 production !What this Spielbeg-Cruise production gave me were eerie and morose feelings of complete dread from the chaos created by the aliens on mankind. Yes, it felt more like a partial horror film than a sci-fi extravaganza.The whole atmosphere of the film throughout was pure and utter tension. Try watching this version of WOTW on a dreary,cloudy cold winter day like I did and the experience is that much more compounded. So, in that sense this Spielberg version promised to deliver the goods on that level. The story line could have used more development or something much more going for it.The chiller aspect of it was more in the vein of ""things that go bump in the night"".Not only were the visuals intense, but the haunting fog horn shattering sounds and ear piercing shrieks, ominous hisses, etc. made by the creatures were nothing short of being regrettably memorable and a bit terrifying! Have not heard sound effects like that in cinema for quite some time...The special effects technology incorporated would have definitely astounded Wells;Whether or not he would have approved of the little twists and surprises along with the dysfunctional family story line is another matter unto itself! I am not a Cruise fan or have ever been. While he is a decent actor, I have always felt that it's just Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise ( no nevermind his quirky offscreen persona abusing living room furniture in interviews, his total undivided devotion to Katie Holmes,direct candor about Scientology with ""glib"" news journalists).If anything, Cruise does turn in a very admiral and convincing performance as a hard working middle class Jersey dad who does not hide the fact that he was more than less of an ideal father for his kids.Also, the man literally looks scared witless after the first initial invasion takes place; he looks completely shell shocked as he is trying to gather and guide his children into safety...Great  waterworks performance in the diner when his character finally breaks down emotionally.Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin were excellently chosen for their roles. Fanning in this movie reminded me that she could very well play in the same league with actress Kate Hudson as her younger sister ! For a little girl she shows a bit of wisdom and intelligence beyond her young years.Her big round blue eyes convey so much depth and emotion without really having to communicate through her dialogue.Some complained about her screaming over the top childish antics in the van escape scene. Remember, she IS a little girl playing a little girl. As she matures in age, she will have an awesome future in her film career. I see her as another Drew Barrymore but with more intensity and serious devotion or depth to her craft---say Jodie Foster?Justin Chatwin bears a striking resemblance to a younger Tom Cruise ; Not just in his acting, but in his physical resemblance.He was chosen wisely.He displayed all the angst,rebellious-curiousity that most teens go through in a dysfunctional family environment! His character wanting to just run into the aliens and help the army destroy them probably had many film goers scratching their heads and saying, ""What's wrong with this kid?"" Not to read too psychologically deep into the character, he was expressing all his anger towards his father and telling him,""Dare me to do it,just dare me"".It's as though through channeling all his anger he had either lost his fear of dying or his will to survive! At the same time the character could have been experiencing serious psychological trauma from being hunted by aliens to cause him to act erratically (you think?)...Or was he going through that boy-man phase of having to grow up quickly and watch over his little sister (father figure responsibilities, but still a child himself).Chatwin displayed that awkward or gawky teen phase pefectly;this showed brilliantly in his physical mannerisms and lanky or stumbling walking manner in some scenes of the film. Either way or in any way Fanning and Chatwin didn't let toothy-grinning Tom Cruise steal all of the acting glory and screen time-presence !This film does not drag but may give the impression since most of the characters and time is spent either hiding underground or making an exodus under literally the thumbs and feet of the aliens.Should there have been more character development, juicier story telling or plot? Perhaps. All in all, War of the Worlds was interesting enough to make me see it twice (too much visually too take in on just one sitting or viewing) !Killer sound effects, too (no pun intended) !",4,If E.T.

634965,A3HWCK7TSEBR3P,B00005JNTI,"A Sacramento Reader ""Sacto-Skeptic""","[2, 3]","I was 10 when I saw the 1953 version, and it gave me nightmares.  Spielberg captured the essence of those nightmares in making the Martian attack seem much more personal, as if they were hunting down YOU specifically through the perspective of Ray (Cruise).  These new war machines--the tripods--are much more frightening than the manta ray ships because they hunt in a personal manner, along with capturing humans for food.  Ironically, however, the manta rays are much more advanced in that their death rays separate the bonds that hold atoms together, whereas the tripods have heat rays.There are some flaws.  The son seems old enough to be a younger brother, so that element never worked for me.  Having the son survive is jarring and makes the attack less threatening.  Also, if the tripods have been buried underground for a million years, why did the Martians a) not inhabit the earth a million years ago instead and b) not evolve technologically during that time?  But most disappointing of all, the hero never really rises to the ocassion by becoming a hero.  Everything he does is because he must do so, not because he reaches beyond himself and his immediate family.  As a result, I never felt an emotional connection to him.But I still recommend seeing it.  There are numerous touches--some subtle, some not so--that reflect our modern times.  The imagery of the crashed 747 is straight out of Lockerbie, adding a link to terrorism, along with the references to Boston, NY, and DC.  I also liked the link between the Minuteman statue and the demise of the invaders.  It's a good movie to see on the big screen, though it may lose a lot when on DVD on the small screen.EDIT:  I forgot to add that there are some nice touches that harken back to the original movie version.  One is the farmhouse where Ray is stranded.  There's a shot of the exterior with the tripods approching it, and to my eyes the farmhouse and the framing of the shot are a direct copy of the original movie scene.  Second, the aliens' heads seem to be derived from the ""probe"" design used in the original movie.  Third, the ending scene of the movie has the main two actors from the original, although they're just sort of awkwardly standing there as if they're lost or needing oxygen or something.",3,Entertaining for adults; nightmarish for kids,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,2281,"['was', '10', 'when', 'saw', '1953', 'version', 'gave', 'nightmares', 'Spielberg', 'captured', 'essence', 'nightmares', 'making', 'Martian', 'attack', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'were', 'hunting', 'down', 'YOU', 'specifically', 'perspective', 'Ray', 'Cruise', 'new', 'war', 'machines', 'tripods', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'manta', 'ray', 'ships', 'hunt', 'personal', 'manner', 'capturing', 'humans', 'food', 'Ironically', 'however', 'manta', 'rays', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'advanced', 'death', 'rays', 'separate', 'bonds', 'hold', 'atoms', 'together', 'tripods', 'have', 'heat', 'are', 'flaws', 'son', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'younger', 'brother', 'element', 'never', 'worked', 'Having', 'son', 'survive', 'jarring', 'attack', 'less', 'threatening', 'Also', 'tripods', 'have', 'been', 'buried', 'million', 'years', 'why', 'did', 'Martians', 'not', 'inhabit', 'earth', 'million', 'years', 'ago', 'instead', 'b', 'not', 'evolve', 'technologically', 'time', 'most', 'disappointing', 'hero', 'never', 'really', 'ocassion', 'becoming', 'hero', 'Everything', 'must', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'immediate', 'family', 'result', 'never', 'felt', 'emotional', 'connection', 'him.But', 'still', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'are', 'numerous', 'touches', 'subtle', 'not', 'so', 'reflect', 'modern', 'times', 'imagery', 'crashed', '747', 'straight', 'Lockerbie', 'adding', 'link', 'terrorism', 'references', 'Boston', 'NY', 'DC', 'also', 'liked', 'link', 'Minuteman', 'statue', 'demise', 'invaders', 'good', 'movie', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'may', 'lose', 'lot', 'when', 'DVD', 'small', 'screen.EDIT', 'forgot', 'add', 'are', 'nice', 'touches', 'harken', 'back', 'original', 'movie', 'version', 'One', 'farmhouse', 'where', 'Ray', 'stranded', 'shot', 'exterior', 'tripods', 'approching', 'eyes', 'farmhouse', 'framing', 'shot', 'are', 'direct', 'copy', 'original', 'movie', 'scene', 'Second', 'aliens', 'heads', 'seem', 'be', 'derived', 'probe', 'design', 'used', 'original', 'movie', 'Third', 'ending', 'scene', 'movie', 'main', 'two', 'actors', 'original', ""'re"", 'just', 'sort', 'awkwardly', 'standing', 'there', ""'re"", 'lost', 'needing', 'oxygen', 'something']",N/A
634966,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B00005JNTI,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[6, 8]","Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds shows that he hasn't lost his touch when it comes to creating blockbuster spectacle that's become the province of the Michael Bay's and his many clones. This is not to say that Michael Bay's films are better, but they do not lack the spectacle or the blockbuster aspects. What Bay's films do not have that Spielberg is now showing these pretenders to the throne is that you can have a summer blockbuster full of spectacle and FX magic, but also have real dramatic tension and heart.Working from David Koepp and Josh Friedman's adaptation of the classic H.G. Wells novel, Spielberg goes back to his roots as a maker of thrillers that first showed his talents as a great director. War of the Worlds has its spectacular CG moments when the alien Tri-Pods first rise up and out of the ground to the look of awe and fear from people witnessing the event. Spielberg begins the film's unrelentless tension from these scenes and never lets go. Once the Tri-Pods start unleashing their death-rays on the populace and whatever else is in their way the film starts moving at breakneck speed. It's these same apocalyptic scenes of the alien's extermination of humans that has prompted critics (both positive and negative) to bring up Spielberg's use of 9/11 imagery. From the clouds of ash and floating pieces of clothes to the sight of people running in panic as destruction rains upon them from out of nowhere.Some critics have labeled Spielberg's film as exploiting the horror of 9/11 and its aftermath, yet when films like 28 Days Later and Land of the Dead use the same imagery and themes these same critics applaud the director of these films as daring. Its an unfair criticism of Spielberg and just shows how some people just seem to use the events of 9/11 as a crutch. Yet, it is this same use of people vaporised into nothing but ash and clothng that adds to the tension and horror. It is easy to use blood and gore to bring up a feel of horror, but Spielberg one up's this and forgo grand guignol scenes. His technique actually brings an inhuman and alien quality to the death and destruction on the screen. From the moment the aliens arrive Spielberg lets us know that this is a war that has not been seen on Earth.Spielberg and his writers have stuck pretty close to what Well's wrote in the original novel, but have decided to look at the story through the eyes of a father and his son and daughter. This gives the film a more personal, disjointed and chaotic feel. There's no scenes of the government powerbrokers debating and deciding how best to combat the aliens and their machines. No scenes of scientists trying to figure out how best to fight and get through the aliens' defenses. In fact, War of the Worlds is the anti-Independence Day. What we get instead is a story of a man and his children trying to just survive the apocalypse occuring around them as best as they can. This choice by Spielberg and his writers to go this route is best shown in a scene where Tom Cruise's character with his kids run into a convoy of military vehicles heading towards the frontline. We see Humvees, M1A2 Main Battle Tanks and other assorted military hardware and hundreds of soldiers. We can hear the sound of the battle just over the ridge of a hill, but just like Cruise's character we do not actually see the battle happening. We hear snippets of commands and reports from the soldiers around Cruise. Spielberg could've easily panned the camera up over the ridge to see how the battle was progressing, but he stays his hand focuses instead on the dad and his family. It's easier to go the route that Bay or Emmerich would take and show the sturm und drang, but that wasn't the story Spielberg was trying to tell.The acting is what you expect from a Spielberg/Cruise collaboration. Cruise is actually very believable as a loser father who seem to look at his kids as more of a hindrance and a scheduled paternal duty than something he actually enjoys and looks forward to. Some of the best scenes Cruise has in the film are quiet ones between him and his daughter (played by Dakota Fanning) where he realizes that he really doesn't know his daughter that well and can't even remotely figure out how to calm her down and make her feel safe. Whe his daughter asks him to sing her a lullaby, the look of incomprehension at not knowing any on Cruise's face is just brilliant. The one misfire in terms of characters in the film is Tim Robbins. The sequence in the film where they meet up with his paranoid and slowly going nuts character is actually very good in terms of ratcheting up the tension, but Robbins' performance was more funny than anything else. Spielberg had created such a doom and gloom atmosphere that Robbins' character's appearance ruins it abit.Overall, I think Spielberg's War of the Worlds succeeds in what it set out to do. It entertains immensely and it also shows that when it comes to blockbuster filmmaking he is still the master and everyone else just pretenders to his throne. As for the ending that some think as being short, abrupt andjust a tad deus ex machina in execution, well I suggest they read or reread the book again. The ending fit the film perfectly. If the film was an all-out blast to the senses then a different one may be a better fit, but for the type of story Spielberg decided to film the ending made sense in its execution.",5,"A terrifying,

634967,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B00005JNTI,A. Schneider,"[0, 3]","I guess this movie was decent enough, it sure was scary and the visuals sure were remarkable. There were also a number of memorable parts in the movies such as most of the scenes involving the mysterious alien invaders (who, in my opinion, were cool as heck but about as creatively designed as crap).All and all the story is pretty straight forward... through a series of action sequences the main characters fight to survive against the alien onslaught of Earth. There is very little the humans can do against the aliens seeing as how the aliens are extremely advanced. Without giving the plot away I will say that I was deeply disappointed with the lack of real world examples given for the technology for which the aliens possessed.All right so I'm a die hard sci-fi fan, oh well...Again though, this is more of the type of movie you'd watch with your friends. It isn't a great breaking sci-fi movie like I expected. Going to the movie's website prior to seeing the movie in the theatres I thought that it was going to be an explosive, completely creative film based on the original novel. I was sadly mistaken... it was another Independence Day (much better done though).One con which I can't seem to stomach is how bad Tom Cruise acted in this movie. Sure there has been a lot of Tom Cruise degrading as of late, but I honestly expected a better performance... his character came across as an arse and continued to till the very end of the movie (there was absolutely no character development on his part... he was a poor father in the beginning, and he was a poor father at the end just with the guise of trying to escape from the dreaded attack of the aliens).This is certainly not the type of film I'd ever see again though for those of you, who liked titles like Independence Day, expect something similar to a cross between Armageddon and... well a movie slightly worse, The Day After Tomorrow.

No, I haven't seen the film version made back in the day. That shouldn't matter at all. What I have seen is Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds. And while the visual effects are impressive (and why shouldn't they be with all of today's technology), the story is under par. My biggest complaint-- what was the motivation for these aliens to plant huge tripods in our earth millions of years ago? This question is never answered, although you can certainly debate resasons in the car ride home.Tom Cruise plays Ray, a divorced father of two children named Robbie and Rachel. There's no doubt that he loves his children, but his main concern is really himself. His son is angry and bitter at his sometimes father; his daughter is the voice of reason. But when Robbie takes his dad's most prized possession -- the car -- Ray is extremely angry and storms out of the house to track him down. Rachel is scared; there had just been a terrible lightening storm that would scare the bejeezes out of even the most composed person. Ray then discovers that all the cars in the city are dead, just stopped in the middle of the roads. The power is out. The phones are dead. Then suddenly the ground starts to shake and out come these huge tripods. We learn that the lightening is actually a way for the aliens to beam down to drive these destructive machines. And not only do these tripods look scary, they vaporize people, leaving only their clothes to float gently to the ground amidst a hoard of running and screaming people. Soon Ray and his two children are on the run, attempting to somehow sruvive this alien extermination.The performances are noteworthy. Dakota Fanning plays Ray's daughter Rachel, in yet another stellar performance. I swear, the child can do no wrong, despite being in a clunky movie. And then of course there's Tom Cruise, who plays the role of the sometimes father, but ultimate protector perfectly. Tim Robbins makes an appearance as an eccentric who believes that he can actually fight the giant tripods with a rifle and an axe. What happens to his character reveals just how much of a protector Ray really is.The visual effects are stunning, but that can only go so far. I want motivation, just a bit of reasoning for this alien attack. Well, duh, I get that they must want our planet, but why? This is just a blank page in the movie. However, I did enjoy myself. It's impressive on the big screen and makes a great summer flick. It's action action action. It's not perfect, but worth shelling out a few bucks to see in the theater.

Trotter,"[18, 65]","Ok boys and girls and other fans, here's a little pre-movie history to whet your appetite and make your palms sweat.Once upon a time, long ago and in New York, a man named Orson Wells who had a regular radio show, had an idea. He decided to do something no-one had ever done before: produce a fictional radio show as though it were a musical broadcast being interrupted by news bulletins. He took a book written by H. G. Wells, and turned it into a radio play (which you can still find recodings of). He broadcast it October 30, 1938: the day before Halloween.In the play a meteor strikes Grover's Mill, New Jersey, and aliens slither out and start vaporising people.People listening from the beginning we ok: they got that it was a radio play. People who caught one of the disclaimers (40 minuites along) were ok, if a little bewildered. But... People who only caught a part of it were not ok. Because of the format and the skill of the production, many people believed it was a real event; they packed up their cars and started to leave the city, packed themselves into cellars, got out guns and basically panicked. Panic spread citywide, causing traffic jams and hysteria. It was a scandal and debacle at the time; it is, from the perspective of many years and much cynicism, extremely funny.Later on, the story was turned into a musical with some truly silly music - Yes, I did own the tapes. It's sort of catchy, even if it's about as likely to make top 40 as I am to ever fit into a size 3 pair of jeans. It was very long, and an almost complete flop.Yet more years later, in the 90's - another vision of the classic book, a TV series  based on the premise that the idea of it being just a radio play was a government cover-up and that aliens really did land in a meteor - was broadcast. It had a couple seasons, with very different formatts. It was b-grade sci-fi-tv and is not available on DVD at this time. (I happened to love it, and if any DVD producers are reading, can you bring it out? I mean, you brought out 21 Jumpstreet - WOTW was much better stuff.) It was shown on late-night TV, and second season features someone better known these days as the star of the Highlander TV series.Now, a fresh look; a big movie. Let's hope it's not too badly mangled from the original. This will be Take 4 on the original story by H. G. Wells.

I remembered the original book, the story of Orson Wells doing a radio play and causing a panic, and an earlier movie which was basically about the panic caused by the radio play. Now at last we have the movie bringing the book to life, leaving out the digression of the radio fiasco. (By the way, that always confused me. How did people believe it was real when it did not take place in real time?)The special effects are very believable, and that makes the horror of the invasion all the more real, but it is Tom Cruise and the little girl who plays his daughter (Dakota Fanning) who make this movie what it is. Cruise is so believable as a father who is not a hero by nature, but will do whatever he needs to protect his children. He eventually loses the son (or so he fears) to the whole adventure of it, but his daughter is too young to even try to break away from Daddy. Yet she is not a coward, either, for all her incredible ability to portray really hysterical screaming. It is in fact uncanny how authentically this child behaves. I believe she has a great career as an actress ahead of her.As spectacular as the special effects are, the movie does not rely entirely on them. There is real human drama here, and not just in how to avoid being killed by the monsters. What is also portrayed with real sensitivity is the interactions of human beings in the face of such overwhelming disaster. Some behave with nobility; some become as vicious as cornered animals. And some, a very few, behave with creative problem-solving. Cruise is one of these.The basic story you know: the world is invaded by mechanical devices, seemingly robots, from outer space. We know nothing other than we are inexplicably under attack. Viciously under attack. The tripods are huge and apparently invincible. They cause enormous destruction. There seems to be no way we will avoid being wiped out completely. But it turns out the tripods are vehicles, and the alien creatures inside them are not indestructible; far from it.

634973,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JNTI,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 3]","Having never seen the original 1953 movie, I can't really compare. Then again, you shouldn't. Steven Spielberg has put together the best alien movie in many a moon. After being in the E.T. world a few times, Spielberg finally goes to the other end of the spectrum and showcases aliens in their worst light. This is not E.T. This is not ""Independence Day"". This is Spielberg's own unique vision, and it's a doozy. Tom Cruise stars as Ray Ferrier, a New York City dock worker who seems to be more involved in himself than his visiting kids. His ex drops them off, and it's ice city. Soon, the sky turns to grey and something is really off. The ground is splitting, cars stall, and something has come up from underground. Aliens have invaded earth and it's a fight for survival as the gigantic alien pods begin zapping away everything and everyone. Ray and kids try to hightail it out of town and to stay alive. The movie is nothing short of eye popping. Breathtaking. It has all the spectacle of a summer popcorn blockbuster, but it has the tone of ""Saving Private Ryan"". This is real. This is serious. It has a dire feel, and it feels very deadly. Unlike most alien movies, this one is actually scary. There are a number of scenes that are quite eeries and uneasy. Spielberg proves what a genius he is. This is some of his best work. I'm not a fan of Cruise, but he is pretty good here. He has the egotistical thing down, and manages to bring Ray around in the end to a family man who will do anything to keep them alive. Because, quite frankly, this is a family story. Not necessarily an alien invasion story. The effects are out of this world, and are so done so brilliantly that it feels so very real. In fact, the whole movie is done so realistically(as it can), that it feels as if this is how it would be if something like this were to really happen. People complain that things hit a stumbling block one Tim Robbins comes in, but I disagree. The whole basement scene was used to much effect. The end?. I didn't think it was as bad as others say, or is a typical Spielberg ""cop out"", but it could of been better. Dakota Fanning is really good, but if I had to hear her scream ""Robbie!"" one more time I was gonna scream myself!. The 9/11 nods are there and are all done quite well. The big town massacre with people incinerating and blowing onto Cruise was unbelieveable. Also unbelieveable are the extras. It's loaded with a lot of cool goodies that make this one exceptional buy.

The films' budget which is said to be in excess of $128,000,000 is money well spent on special effects & CGI (the earth cracking up bit seemed very realistic so was the plane crash scene at Cruises' ex-wife's house) but nevertheless the movie looks like its headed down the same path as Waterworld did 10 years ago, just as its predecessor it was hyped so much that living up to its billing shall become impossible.Dakota Fanning & Tim Robbins performances were outstanding however despite their valiant attempt at rescuing the movie it is destined for austerity. H. G. Wells' classic tale of alien invasion as seen through the eyes of one American family fighting to survive it, is a great novel however this movie did not do justice to the book, the 50's version seemed to be better explained, had a better plot & was fairly clear-cut.The movie on principal was flawed. Like why didn't the ""invaders"" start their ""blood sucking"" exercise earlier on in the movie instead of blowing up all those people to smithereens & wasting that entire valuable food source? How come after the Electromagnetic pulse hit the city/country one guys' camcorder captured everything??? Here is a brief history on EMP. EMP is a high-intensity, short-duration burst of electromagnetic energy. Although the electric field created from an EMP lasts for only a short time, its effects can be devastating. Electrical systems connected to things that can conduct current like wires, antennas, and metal objects will suffer significant damage. EMP effects on electronics include interference of radio frequency links, irreparable damage to microcircuits, and even the disabling of satellites. So how come a seasoned sci-fi filmmaker like Spielberg not know that.This was supposed to be a contemporary retelling of H.G. Wells' seminal novel, the film turned into a sci-fi adventure thriller with no meaning what-so-ever. Besides in true Hollywood / summer movie fashion; I expected Tom Cruise to save the world, revive any resistance to the aliens & salvage whatever was left of this planet, instead he is just an average Joe struggling to stay alive with the backdrop being the extraordinary battle for the future of humankind it.Verdict: Not what you'd expect from Spielberg, nor what you'd expect from Cruise, however the special effects, graphics etc... is the only thing that meets what we've come to expect & anticipate in a Spielberg movie. I wouldn't recommend watching it unless of course you have absolutely nothing better to do.

As well, having seen the original WOTW when I was very young, this movie was made in the 50's sci-fi spirit. It is almost a hark back (with a giant leap forward!) to those times when the fantastic was still fantastic, and not something allready seen 1000 times.Compared to Independance Day, and Signs, the plot is very similar (though this was the original alien invasion story)none of those movies actually get the psychological wheels turning, as far as what it would actually feel like to be in that situation in mass histeria. The sense of dread is what got me. No matter where they run, they are coming. And they are very very thorough. Without giving away some of the finer points, this is the worst case scenario for a massive alien invasion, and it is shown on a grand scale. I was not expecting much from a Tom Cruise movie, but was pleasently suprised.

Now I see review after review where people think War of the Worlds is a mediocre film.  No.  Not at all.  Now I'm REALLY angry.I really really love War of the Worlds.  The plot is quite interesting.  It's about aliens that walk around the planet in giant machines destroying people, one by one.  I thought the movie was entirely good because it effectively scared the crap out of me.  Imagine if this really happened?  Wouldn't it be the scariest thing ever?  Yes!Everything from the sudden, unusual lightning storm in the beginning of the film, to the aliens coming out of the city street in a giant machine walking around killing people and destroying buildings, to Tom Cruise and his family hiding and sleeping in a basement, only to wake up to the loud realization that the aliens were heading straight for them in the middle of the night.The plot works because the aliens don't appear very often.  Most of the time you see the giant machines with spotlights shining down and searching for people to annihilate, but you don't really see the aliens, which makes the story a very good mystery.  Okay, so you see more of the aliens near the end, but not very often in the first half.The plot is perfectly easy to understand which gives the movie a LOT of points because usually science fiction movies make ZERO sense.  I understood what was happening the entire time perfectly fine.I thought the movie was overall much better than the reviews made it out to be, and for the most part, the reviews were extremely positive (or so I thought).  I guess War of the Worlds didn't hold up well over time for most people.  Well, it held up just fine for me.My favorite scene has to be when Tom Cruise was hiding behind a house and in the corner of his eye he saw the giant alien machine walking forward.  It was a very good, frightening scene because I have had plenty of dreams where something big and unexplainable was chasing me, and in the dreams, I would hide and pray that the thing doesn't turn in my direction because I wouldn't know what to do.  That scene told exactly what happens when I have a nightmare.I guess people don't like action, creativity, special effects, and a memorable, intriguing story in the films they watch.  Oh well.

I'm not particularly a fan of his, and while I'll be the first to admit he's a freak (although not on the scale of Michael Jackson), I also think he's done soem marvelous acting (Born on the 4th of July pops into my head).  I also noticed that a lot of reviewers are very concerned about how faithful or not this version is to the original book.  All I can say about this is that although I don't know why Spielberg felt the need to change the way the aliens get to earth (the book is perfectly fine the way it is), it didn't seem to me that the other changes were gratutious.  I think that those invested in the orthodoxy of the book needn't worry; the film stays true to the spirit of the book.The DVD itself (and here I'm refering to the single-disk wide screen edition) is OK; color and sound are fine.  My only issue is the surprising lack of extra meterials.  There is one short documentary on the imaginative process behind the aliens and their tripods, but other than this - bupkis. I would have thought that a Speilberg blockbuster such as this would have had a ton of extras.  Now perhaps these extras are on the two-disc set, but if so, why put out a single disk edition?

It was not all bad; there were attempts to keep some of the original story and included some of the designs from the 1954 film. We are also treated to a bloodsucking scene reminiscent of the original story. Of course Stephen Spielberg didn't want to copy the book or the original movie so the aliens pop up instead of fly down, six of one half dozen of another.The graphics were fairly decent and did not look like the cheat CGI that you usually see on quick movies. The background music stayed in the background where it belongs.This is not the easiest presentation to rank as for people that like bloodsucking fast action nerdy kids stories this could be a five star out of five stars; however for anybody seeking any kind of depth or relationship to the original story or relationship to the original movie this is more of a two star Phil.

Here is the start of Cruise's character experiencing the aliens for the first time.  The Martians had their tripod war machines waiting in the ground for thousands of years and they just happen to end up under the city that was built much later.  What?  Duh.  It pretty much ruined the movie for me.  All Spielberg wanted was to show how great he could master the special effects of the streets ripping up and use dolby sound to enhance the effects.  TOTAL AND AWFUL CONTRIVING ON HIS PART.  It really hurt my ability to accept the movie.  Sometimes an excellent old movie is better left alone no matter how much a director wants show his knack for special effects.,2,How long were they waiting down there?,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,774,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'took', 'old', 'movie', 'fairly', 'believable', 'story', 'made', 'remake', 'utterly', 'unbelievable', 'Here', 'start', 'Cruise', 'character', 'experiencing', 'aliens', 'first', 'time', 'Martians', 'had', 'tripod', 'war', 'machines', 'waiting', 'ground', 'thousands', 'years', 'just', 'happen', 'end', 'up', 'city', 'was', 'built', 'much', 'later', 'What', 'Duh', 'pretty', 'much', 'ruined', 'movie', 'Spielberg', 'wanted', 'was', 'show', 'how', 'great', 'could', 'master', 'special', 'effects', 'streets', 'ripping', 'up', 'use', 'dolby', 'sound', 'enhance', 'effects', 'TOTAL', 'AWFUL', 'CONTRIVING', 'ON', 'HIS', 'PART', 'really', 'hurt', 'ability', 'accept', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'excellent', 'old', 'movie', 'better', 'left', 'alone', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'director', 'show', 'knack', 'special', 'effects']",N/A
634984,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B00005JNTI,Bill Garrison,"[1, 2]","The War of the Worlds is a remake and therefore has to bear some resemblance to the famous story that it is copying.  But we can tell right off that the true story of the movie is about Ray Farrior and his two kids. Farrior, played by Cruise, isn't the best dad in the world.  His kids don't really like him and the ex-wife has moved on to a rich man named Tim and she is even expecting a baby.Then the aliens attack and Farrior must protect his kids and himself, all the while he and everyone else is scared to death.  Cruise doesn't play a cocky hero full of courage, but instead is just as scared as everyone else as the aliens kill and destroy everything in sight.This movie is quite a spectacle and the effects are fun to watch.  It's a nice change of pace to have so much of the story not rely on the effects, yet we still get to see the spectacular effects we expect in summer blockbusters.The plot from the beginning is simple.  Will Farrior and his kids stay alive and will the kids make it back to their mother.  The plot isn't about will Farrior kill the aliens or save the earth.  Farrior still has some brave moments, such as protecting his daughter (played by Dakota Fanning) from the deranged Tim Robbins, or when he chooses to potentially sacrifice his life for his own kids.  So when the plot is will Farrior save his kids, I had hoped for a little more of an emotional payoff at the end.  I won't spoil the ending, but the reuniting with the ex is about as bland as possible, and the aliens are defeated by a voice over.Overall, I recommend this movie because of its different approach.  Speilberg tells the story of one man and his family set against the backdrop of a big budget special effects blockbuster.  This movie is similar to Independence Day, except one tells the story of the entire war, and one tells the story of one family.",4,A small movie with a lot of effects,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1856,"['War', 'Worlds', 'remake', 'therefore', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'famous', 'story', 'copying', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'off', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'Ray', 'Farrior', 'two', 'kids', 'Farrior', 'played', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'best', 'dad', 'world', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'ex-wife', 'moved', 'rich', 'man', 'named', 'Tim', 'even', 'expecting', 'baby.Then', 'aliens', 'attack', 'Farrior', 'must', 'protect', 'kids', 'while', 'everyone', 'else', 'scared', 'death', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'play', 'cocky', 'hero', 'full', 'courage', 'instead', 'just', 'as', 'scared', 'everyone', 'else', 'aliens', 'kill', 'destroy', 'everything', 'sight.This', 'movie', 'quite', 'spectacle', 'effects', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'not', 'rely', 'effects', 'yet', 'still', 'get', 'see', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'expect', 'summer', 'blockbusters.The', 'plot', 'beginning', 'simple', 'Will', 'Farrior', 'kids', 'stay', 'alive', 'will', 'kids', 'make', 'back', 'mother', 'plot', ""n't"", 'about', 'will', 'Farrior', 'kill', 'aliens', 'save', 'earth', 'Farrior', 'still', 'brave', 'moments', 'such', 'protecting', 'daughter', 'played', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'deranged', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'when', 'potentially', 'sacrifice', 'life', 'own', 'kids', 'So', 'when', 'plot', 'will', 'Farrior', 'save', 'kids', 'had', 'hoped', 'little', 'more', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'reuniting', 'ex', 'as', 'bland', 'possible', 'aliens', 'are', 'defeated', 'voice', 'over.Overall', 'recommend', 'movie', 'different', 'approach', 'Speilberg', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'family', 'set', 'backdrop', 'big', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'similar', 'Independence', 'Day', 'one', 'story', 'entire', 'war', 'one', 'story', 'one', 'family']",N/A
634985,A2POYXTGSPSW7O,B00005JNTI,Bill Hensler,"[5, 7]","I gave this movie two stars.  It deserves a little better, 2.5 stars but the Amazon machine does not allow that.  The movie is not bad to watch.  It does provide some entertainment.The Martian death ray is fairly neat to watch.  If it hits a person they turn into ash, kind of like a mobile holocaust machine.  Later you see ash raining out of a grey sky and the haunting memory of the dissolved people hits the viewer of the video.I had a wish the movie would follow the book more.  The best part of the H.G. Wells book is when the armored ship ""Thunderchild"" turns to protect a fleeing convoy of refugees and faces certain doom.  ""Thunderchild"" gives better than she gets before being sunk.  I was really wishing a similar part would be in this movie, such as an Arleigh Burke class destroyer smashing a few of the Martian walkers before being sunk.  The best thing the viewer will see for people fighting back is when a soldier gets lucky with a few hand grenades while a Martian is reaching for a snack.H.G. Well tossed the bone of hope with the Thunderchild because the Martian death machines were running over the Victorian age armies like a lawn mower cuts grass.  That hope is dashed and the reader then is taken into a journey of an Earth transformed into a neo-Mars.I will say this movie is not better than the 1950s era ""War of the Worlds"", a five star movie that stands the test of time.  Indeed, the modern Martian walkers have to have energy shields else modern weapons would cut them appart, just like the 50s movie.  Also, no weapons of mass destruction are used against the Martians.  If everybody in your town is being ""death rayed"" into human ashes then why would it matter if a nuclear weapon or two was used?  A Martian walker energy shield can stop an Army rocket:  why didn't Spielburg have an shield stop a nuclear weapon to prove to a viewer it could be done?I didn't like the character of Dakota Channing in this movie.  I have kids.  There is a point where a parent tells children the family is in a survival situation, crying is not allowed, and we must concentrate on survival.  Most children will take the advice quickly.  Children are better survivors than adults when the chips are down.  I wish Spielberg had done more with the children characters.  Rebellion does not increase your chance of survival.Now, to Tom Cruise... what can you say?  He is the main character and if he got wacked it would not effect the story one bit.My family and I will watch this movie if there isn't anything on the satellite TV.  My older than 11 year old kids can watch it.  If we wanted nightmares from the six year old we would let him watch it.  So, I highly advise people with younger children not to let them watch this movie unless they like little children with nightmares to be running into their room at 3 AM in the morning.It's not a totally bad movie.

Well, what the hell, it's a war movie.  He captures the book's theme (that humans might be insignificant on a cosmic scale) in a modern context. His visual motif (he recently admitted) is the Islamic terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, which he crudely re-enacts as a set of Martian attacks.  The results onscreen are surprisingly convincing.Inducing horror with slow, deliberate action punctuated by dreamlike silences is not a new cinemattic device, and Spielberg over-uses it a bit. But most of it still works -- evoking flashbacks to  the tension-building scenes from ""Jaws"", and ""Duel"".  But for ""War Of the WOrlds"" the scale has been increased -- almost dwarfing the attacks on the World Trade Center & The Pentagon.  Action movie fans get plenty of what they expect here: falling bodies, faces covered with human remains, missing person posters, crashed-jet parts, and other carnage.The vignettes from the book that were chosen for the screenplay make for a somewhat un-even plot.""WAR"" starts out strong. Ominous dark clouds, lightning bolts. earthquakes, etc.  It's a lot like the scenes in ""Jurassic Park"" (just before the T-Rex gets loose). After watching people being vaporized by aliens, Tom Cruise hijacks a minivan, grabs his kids and splits, stupidly heading for his ex-wife's house (a gas tank away from where the aliens started their mass killing). The plot focuses on the squabbling family members.Cruise's character (Ray Ferrier) decides to learn more about ""the enemy"". Onscreen, it's about as interesting as a watching an automaton. Unable to develop either a strategy or a resistance, cruise bores the audience with alien trivia.  It's another mediocre performaance -- on (sub) par with his role in ""Minority Report'.  Spielberg's direction, which did not call for Cruise to act like an ""action hero"" is eerily reminiscnent of the Bush administration's incompetent response to 9/11: put America on homeland security lockdown, don't retaliate against the worst enemy states, and make a speech, and issue bromides about helping others. Once it's clear that Tom Cruise might as well a ""Pod Person"" (about half way through the movie), War-Of The Worlds becomes an out-and-out drag..Cruise's Son yearns to shoot back, Dad won't let him (I still don't know why), and the daughter just screams for most of the movie. The world has gone to hell, and this trio doesn't do much besides shriek, cry and watch corpses float down the river. Man is powerless, which is to say meaningless, and, as Morgan Freeman's narrative explains, he can be crushed like a bug by random acts of nature.The impersonal mass-killings acutally get tiresome.  The loss of any sense of individuality, and the absence of any heroes, suggest a very short box office run, and lackluster DVD sales will be this movie's fate.This version of ""War of the Worlds"" is like a set of Americana  paintings splattered with blood.  THere are hordes of average people shown living in chronic fear, surrounded by fresh dead bodies. The depictions look realistic --remember, it's patterned after the 09/11/2001 terrorist attacks.Although Speilberg intended that this be a horror/action movie, it jsut doesn't work all that well.  Unlike DUEL, which involved a psychotic (and never-seen) truckerd), or JAWS, which involved a shark--realistic since shark attacks do occur from time to time, WAR OF THE WORLDS is a bit preposterous.

Marold""","[3, 7]","This Stephen Spielberg version of 'War of the Worlds' got very good reviews, adding to the cachet brought to the project by the very famous director, and cancelling out any negative apprehensions about star Tom Cruise. So, I expected to enjoy this movie and I did.One thing I suggest the naysayers take into consideration is that this is much much more than a special effects extravaganza such as confections like 'Hellboy' or even worse, 'Van Helsing'. It has strong similarities to 'Independence Day' which was good, but this is better. Spielberg essentially went back to H. G. Wells' original on most points, borrowing some hints from Orson Wells' version, but basicly sticking to the original text.Spielberg's stroke of genius which puts the movie over the top, with an enormous assist from young actor Dakota Fanning, is the concentration on the plight of the single family based on the father character played by Cruise.And, Cruise executes the role effectively and believability. One may suspect that the part may have been done better by a relative unknown so that you were not constantly reminded that you were looking at a major movie star, but Cruise carries it off nonetheless.If I had any problem at all with the story, it was the premise that the Martians' war machines were buried on Earth millions of years ago and that the Martians came down on lightning bolts.Oddly, our experience with governments' response to Katrina make the movie even more believable, as we had a dose of how ineffective governments can be in the face of an emergency.As Sci Fi / Monster flicks go, almost on a par with the original King Kong.",5,Excellent Treatment of the Classic.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 4]","I'm giving this film three stars not because I'm trying to walk a tightrope here between those that loved it and those that  didn't, but because there were some serious flaws in the film(most notably portions of the script) that could've easily been fixed but weren't.Most film watchers go to the movies to be entertained, and on that level this film doesn't disappoint. The CGI is the best I've seen, the sets are excellent, and the filming is great. Even the addition of the family dynamic into this wonderful science fiction tale added to my enjoyment.But I go to the movies (and so do others I know) to be entertained AND for brain food. What I mean is that I want the stories I see on celluloid to make sense; not just make sense when it's convenient. Examples:SPOILERS!!!!1. When the Tripods first attack Jersey, they EMP it with their lightning storm and everything electronic shorts out; everything EXCEPT a video camera that falls to the ground and we get to see the first destructive blows to the world through. Not good.2. Why was most of Boston spared the destruction of the Tripods (the entire East Coast had been obliterated, including the major cities, but Boston was saved? Come on!)3. Why didn't Cruises' character get some food out of the fridge when they arrived at his ex-wife's house?4. The assumption is that these ""vampire"" aliens may have been waiting for the planet to become populated before they attacked, I guess. But what were they living on before coming to Earth?5. Cruises' characters son was saved? What the... How? The entire hill the boy was standing on was flamed, tanks tossed into the air and crushed. Impossible. Oh. I know how: because this is a Hollywood feel-good movie.6. They even slipped a bit of scientology in the film (at least the way I saw it) when Dakota Fanning crosses her arms and chants that this is ""her space"". Hmm. Healing via the mind, maybe?The good aspects of the film helped balance my review rating, but the bad most definitely prevented it from becoming a 4 or 5 star success.I'm still glad I saw it , though.

I do not understand the negative reviews of this movie, and I think these reviewers are looking a little to deep within a movie that is strictly for entertainment value.Luckily for us, this movie does not have any of the cheesy White House/Capitol Records blow-ups and destructions as its wimpy predecessors such as ""Independence Day"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow"". Instead, Spielberg keeps the action much closer to home; and right in your own backyard!The plot is basic and straightforward :Ray Ferrier (Cruise) is a single father, who doesn't have the closest relationship with his two children. In fact- they are a bit ""estranged"" to say the least.  On a typical weekend drop-off of the kids is when our martians began invading and Ray's parental instincts begin to kick in.It starts out as a weather storm that looks rather cool - & then things begin to go horribly wrong. Lightening bolts began shooting out of the sky, and then from the ground, giant three legged mechanical tripods began to emerge. At first nobody knows what to make of them- until they suddenly start vaporizing humans and destroying every building on the ground ; and that's when the panic, anxiety, and fight for survival begins!The rest of the movie centers on Cruises struggle to keep his children alive and get them back to Boston-where there mother is hopefully unharmed. In between, we get fantastic action sequences as cities are destroyed and the true nature of the visitors is revealed.""War of the Worlds"" is not sugary sweet like some many other Spielberg films- and if anything- the film invokes a sense of panic and fear with the audience......because this is something that possibly could happen one day. And of course, this would be our civilizations worst nightmare. The film proves itself to be kind of creepy, if not downright scary- and this is where Speilberg succeeds marvelously.All in all, ""War of the Worlds"" is an instant sci-fi classic- and one of the better (if not THE best) movies we will see this summer.

Yet, like any Hollywood big shot, he has his detractors.  I think they just feel he is overrated.  Despite said classics to the contrary, his products from the last near-decade (and if you didn't like ""Saving Private Ryan"" you can go back even farther than that) make a good case for that kind of backlash.This movie is perhaps his biggest misstep to date.It is all the more glairing a misstep because it somehow managed to become a huge hit; despite not being any good and despite staring a guy who likes to jump on couches for millions of viewers.  And why not, that is generally the extent of his performance range.  It sure is here anyway.  That subtle, but not near as animated.Even if you disagree that it is a disapointing, nay, insulting remake, you can not defend the lame sentimentality, Dakota Fanning's screaching or explain the just-plain awful plot holes, like if EMP shuts down everything from cars to wrist watches, why can a guy's video camera tape him getting fried by aliens?  And explain why when aliens attack they have an orchestra play their theme song (no, seriously, its the sound THEY make before they attack)? And explain why after a good start and some frightening moments the movie just sucks and sucks until it wraps everything up all of a sudden in a way that sucks more than anything sucked before it.You wanna know why?  Steven Spielberg.  This movie has crap in it that plays right into the hands of his detractors (like me).And then there is Tom Cruise.

The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A-class talent.

Agnew ""rothwyn""","[7, 15]","""This isn't a war any more than there's a war between men and maggots.""Be prepared for a different side of Spielberg.To begin with, those going into War of the Worlds expecting something along the line of Independence Day should forget any preconceptions that they have about alien invasion films. Forget that Spielberg knows how to make rousing crowd-pleasing popcorn movies, and remember that he made Saving Private Ryan. Now, imagine what would happen if you took a civilian from that war and spent an entire movie following just them during the invasion of Normandy. It's a war film, not a science-fiction adventure romp. And it's one of the best in recent memory.War of the Worlds, as retold by Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, is a tight, focused narrative showing a terrifying version of war from only the point of view of a single civillian family. There are not heroic presidents, no fighter pilot jockeys, no brilliant scientists to save the day at the last minute, this is a story about an estranged father fighting to keep his family alive as aliens systematically try to eradicate the human race.It's also one of the best white-knuckle suspense experiences in recent movie history. Imagine if the mechanical shark in Jaws had worked from the beginning instead of just slowly building suspense. Once the film gets going, it's a breathless ride, stopping only once or twice for some chilling looks into the darker regions of the human psyche (and a brilliant performance by Tim Robbins). And while it's an update more than an adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic sci-fi novel, it still retains the spirit of the book, as well as its subsequent adaptations: scaring the pants off of an audience.And this film is a nail-biter. ILM achieves new heights of photo-realism with their computer effects, and John Williams' score will have you jumping, but it's really Spielberg and his stars that make this film the work of art that it is.Spielberg does this partly by who he chooses to tell the story about. Since Ray and his family are just normal citizens, they know next to nothing about the aliens, the state of the rest of the country, what the army is doing at any given time, or how their friends and family are coping (if they're even alive). Additionally, Spielberg outdoes himself with some brilliant camera work that works perfectly with whatever mood any particular scene is setting (pay special attention to the car ride out of Washington D.C. and the scene inthe woods with the falling empty clothes). There's also a sequence in a basement that makes the ""Raptors in the Kitchen"" sequence from Jurassic Park seen downright tame in comparison.However, what is perhaps most impressive about the films is the performances. With Dakota Fanning of particular note, all the actors do an absolutely wonderful job in their roles, even though much of the movie requires reactive acting from them. They manage to keep the audience grounded in the movie, and provide an anchor that makes them important enough to care about, which only goes toward heightening the suspense of the film when the chips are down. War of the Worlds proves that, if nothing else, Spielberg will go down in film history as perhaps the best director of child actors ever to work in the US.And as for the movie itself, if you're looking for a good dose of human drama to go with a thrilling sci-fi suspense film, you really couldn't do any better.",5,Truly terrifying. . .,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,3447,"[""n't"", 'war', 'more', 'war', 'men', 'maggots', 'Be', 'prepared', 'different', 'side', 'Spielberg.To', 'begin', 'going', 'War', 'Worlds', 'expecting', 'something', 'line', 'Independence', 'Day', 'should', 'forget', 'preconceptions', 'have', 'alien', 'invasion', 'films', 'Forget', 'Spielberg', 'how', 'make', 'rousing', 'crowd-pleasing', 'popcorn', 'movies', 'remember', 'made', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Now', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'took', 'civilian', 'war', 'spent', 'entire', 'movie', 'following', 'just', 'invasion', 'Normandy', 'war', 'film', 'not', 'science-fiction', 'adventure', 'romp', 'one', 'best', 'recent', 'memory.War', 'Worlds', 'retold', 'Spielberg', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'tight', 'focused', 'narrative', 'showing', 'terrifying', 'version', 'war', 'only', 'point', 'view', 'single', 'civillian', 'family', 'are', 'not', 'heroic', 'presidents', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'jockeys', 'brilliant', 'scientists', 'save', 'day', 'last', 'minute', 'story', 'estranged', 'father', 'fighting', 'keep', 'family', 'alive', 'aliens', 'systematically', 'try', 'eradicate', 'human', 'race.It', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'white-knuckle', 'suspense', 'experiences', 'recent', 'movie', 'history', 'Imagine', 'mechanical', 'shark', 'Jaws', 'had', 'worked', 'beginning', 'instead', 'just', 'slowly', 'building', 'suspense', 'film', 'going', 'breathless', 'ride', 'stopping', 'only', 'once', 'twice', 'chilling', 'darker', 'regions', 'human', 'psyche', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'update', 'more', 'adaptation', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'novel', 'still', 'spirit', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'subsequent', 'adaptations', 'scaring', 'pants', 'audience.And', 'film', 'nail-biter', 'ILM', 'new', 'heights', 'photo-realism', 'computer', 'effects', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'will', 'have', 'jumping', 'really', 'Spielberg', 'stars', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'partly', 'who', 'tell', 'story', 'Ray', 'family', 'are', 'just', 'normal', 'citizens', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'aliens', 'state', 'rest', 'country', 'what', 'army', 'doing', 'given', 'time', 'how', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'coping', ""'re"", 'even', 'alive', 'Additionally', 'Spielberg', 'brilliant', 'camera', 'work', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'particular', 'scene', 'setting', 'pay', 'special', 'attention', 'car', 'ride', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'scene', 'inthe', 'woods', 'falling', 'empty', 'clothes', 'also', 'sequence', 'basement', 'Raptors', 'Kitchen', 'sequence', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'seen', 'downright', 'tame', 'comparison.However', 'what', 'perhaps', 'most', 'impressive', 'films', 'performances', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'particular', 'note', 'actors', 'do', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'job', 'roles', 'even', 'much', 'movie', 'reactive', 'acting', 'manage', 'keep', 'audience', 'grounded', 'movie', 'provide', 'anchor', 'important', 'enough', 'care', 'only', 'heightening', 'suspense', 'film', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'War', 'Worlds', 'nothing', 'else', 'Spielberg', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'film', 'history', 'perhaps', 'best', 'director', 'child', 'actors', 'ever', 'work', 'US.And', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'dose', 'human', 'drama', 'go', 'thrilling', 'sci-fi', 'suspense', 'film', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'better']",N/A

Don't get me wrong though, I think it started off pretty strong.(SEMI-SPOILERS BELOW)The good:---------I liked how the storm came and the lightning and the wind - it had a great dramatic feel to it.I loved the look of the tripod tanks - that was awesome.I loved the sound of the tripod tanks - that was chilling.I loved the special effects of the tripod beams - that seemed realistic.I liked the sound of the distant battle between the U.S. military and the tripods - the distance rolling thunder of projectiles firing was realistic and appreciated.The bad:--------Are we really supposed to believe that an alien civilization would plant these huge battle tanks underground for millions of years awaiting for their arrival? Why wouldn't they all just show up at once? Wouldn't their tech be millions of years out of date by then? Wouldn't they be corroded since their shields would be down (realistically assuming their batteries don't run for a million years straight).Why wouldn't we have found a single one of these tanks during all this time? Jeez, some of them were right under the city. That seems very improbable.Are we really supposed to believe that something as wide as a person can ride a lightning beam from the clouds through a little hole the size of a grape fruit, and into their tripod tank? Come on, that's just ridiculous. And where did the aliens come from? Rain clouds? This was never answered.How come the aliens looked strangely like the aliens from Independence Day (in the face)?What was the point of the aliens sucking out peoples' blood and spraying it all over the place?How did Ray's son survive the napalm blast at the top of the hill that wiped out that platoon of soldiers? You have to admit that's really stupid.How come when the jet plane crashed into Ray's ex's house, almost all of the plane parts were all there in his yard? Wouldn't they be spread over a much larger area, and wouldn't there be far fewer recognizable pieces? And wouldn't Ray's house be burnt to a cinder? And how come there weren't any bodies, as one would assume there should be?Why were all those people just standing around the middle of the crater as the ground started cracking all over the place? Does that seem like the type of behavior you'd expect from people? I'd be running the heck away from there, but these people acted like it was all amusing. That hardly seems like actual human behavior to me.* * * * *I could keep going on, but my point isn't to say that I expect a totally realistic movie - that would be boring. But I like:-very basic laws of physics to be obeyed (a bigger object can't fit through a smaller object)-very basic human emotions to be obeyed (hmmmm, this looks dangerous, I should run away)-very basic knowledge about probabilities (we'd never unearth one of these machines, even though our cities sit on top of them)-just common sensibility (let's plant all our war machines on this planet before any intelligent life even exists there just in case it does at some point so that we can exterminate it - how does that even make sense?)Again, I'm a huge sci-fi fan, but this whole movie just seemed so contrived and nonsensical.

635006,A3H4TIVTTA5IBB,B00005JNTI,Brian A. Wolters,"[1, 2]","War of the Worlds is a visually stunning and ultimately terrifying film about encounters with ruthless invaders. While I praise this film for the alien scenes and plot, the rest is so mundane and negative that it almost ruins the movie.The movie introduces is to Ray (Tom Cruise) and his ex-wife and kids. He is to watch the kids while his ex-wife is away for the weekend. During this time, Ray encounters a massive and strange electric storm and later on discovers it triggered massive machines buried underground that start destroying or harvesting man.I have to say that the first encounter with the tripod is an amazing scene. When it finally stands erect and emits it's terrifying sound before battle, I couldn't help but feel an immense dread at the events that were to lie ahead. This is very effective movie making and right away put me in the place of the characters.The film basically tries to top each encounter and it succeeds nicely. The next time we see a Tripod, it stands ominously over a town near the ferry. Once again, we hear the terrifying battle call of the tripod before it attacks and the panic swells. Moving on, we are treated with a Tripod under the water and then an amazing scene of several of them wrecking havoc on the town and people running for safety. The next time we see them is one of the most bizarre and terrifying moments in the movie, as they emit even stranger sounds as they do something to the soil for long periods of time. This mechanical noise as they did this was very unsettling and could drive anyone to panic. Beyond the probe and alien scenes (which were also effective), we are treated up close and personal to the cage and the organic looking insertion tube where the humans are processed. This is all amazingly good and terrifying stuff.As far as the rest of the film, the characters are just not likable to care much about. Yes, I know there is divorce in the world but why do we always need broken marriages in movies? Ray isn't a likable guy and despite his heroics, he still doesn't come across as anything but a loser even at the end of the film. The family scenes, the crowds scenes and the driving scenes were pretty bland and just didn't do much for me. The TV reporter scene (at the plane crash) was very strange and badly acted and only served to help further the plot some. And the scene with Tim Robbins, outside the alien stuff, was just lacking.

635007,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B00005JNTI,Brian Driver,"[1, 1]","If Amazon had a ten-point scale, WAR OF THE WORLDS would be a 7...but I'm giving it a 4 because I don't feel its 3.2 rating here on Amazon is fair...or more properly, represents its worth. More about that at the end. For now......it's the Ferrier family who draws our focus: Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a divorced father who is taking his kids for the weekend, which is unfortunate for two reasons: his kids aren't too pleased with him, and, well, the whole alien thing. I know a lot of people hate the family dynamic here, which focused on a lot of bitchiness when we, the audience, could care less, and want to see aliens. I mean, after all, ALIENS HAVE ATTACKED...can't you work on your problems another weekend?So, as for these aliens. Here there are positive points: the special effects are quite well done, for the most part. For instance, the initial lightning blasts that occurred with the sharp bellowing Klaxon-like horn sound - we find out later that they are apparently using these blasts to send down the pilots and crew of the aliens' underground vessels. The sonics of these blasts were pretty jarring, and frightening...it wasn't until later that I began thinking about the process and it lost some credibility...more about that later.But it was very quickly after those lightning blasts that the road began buckling and cracks began to appear. This was well done, too, and threatening, indeed: the cracks were handled superbly, and as the streets came apart the tripods emerged, and it was these monstrous things that really carried the day. Their ominous, deep horn-like sounds were quite impressive. When they began cracking out of the ground the splintering of the asphalt and nearby buildings was unnerving, and very believable -- as effects, these were done extremely well. Additionally, their vaporizing weapons were configured nicely - one blast, a bright explosion, a swirl of atmosphere, and then the floating down of clothes...free of their wearer.  One clever effect used was seeing a vaporization in an idle camera's viewfinder; an intelligent ""remove,"" if you will, which I think suggested the honesty of the moment: SEE? It says, no special effects used here, just an everyday camera shot. (Though I thought all power was shut off by the aliens...hmm...)Additionally, certain scenes were created with craft and restraint, and those proved especially shocking: for instance, the bodies floating down the river - first one, then three, then eight, then...all at once, dozens, suggesting a massacre. THAT was quite powerful. Later, the shock of a train on fire was very potent and unexpected, as was an earlier scene where they took refuge in the children's mother's house, hiding in the cellar when they heard huge explosions outside, and then their coming out of the cellar in the morning only to find the house blown to shreds, and then the neighborhood, ruined beyond comprehension, and not one emergency vehicle in sight - driving home the enormity of the destruction. And following the upheaval of the ferry boat and yet another attack of the monstrous tripods, as the beleaguered, wet, all-but-defeated Ferriers walked along through the woods, clothes drifted through the air toward the ground, another reminder of souls lost.Some effective scenes, however, did not hold up well when thought about later. For instance, one particular element of the downed neighborhood plane bothered me: namely, what was it doing in the air, hours after the invasion? Was it a commercial flight?  Who would fly in the night of an alien invasion? I, too, had all sorts of unanswered questions when it came to the buried alien vehicles: why wouldn't they attack back when they were buried, as the news lady said, thousands of years ago? We were even more ""primitive"" then... wouldn't that be important? And how did we NEVER discover these things...not a ONE? Certainly, somewhere in the world someone would have put in power lines or a subway or anything that would have run across one of them.And it seemed a little odd, too, that despite world-wide destruction meted out by the aliens left the ex-wife's parent's house in Boston as snug as a bug in a rug. Not a brick out of place (though it was sure nice to see Ann Robinson and Gene Barry - both were leads in the original movie). And the fact the son - separated from his family and presumed dead in a MAJOR explosion - should arrive home within minutes of the father and sister, with nary a hair out of place, is just a little beyond strangely coincidental.Oddly enough, WotW tends to do better with critics than it did with audiences. While Metacritic gave it a 73, and Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 74 percent ""Fresh"" rating, Amazon's ... fans at the time of this review gave it a 3.2...and more than that, reviews were almost exactly proportioned along the 5-point scale: about half of Amazon's 1000 + reviewers have given it a 4 or 5 (22% for the former, and 26 for the latter), and 1s, 2s, and 3s were almost uniformly proportioned over the other half. It seems WotW is about as divisive a film as I have seen.

I haven't read the book, but I would imagine that it relayed a little more of the story and what was going on than this movie does. All we see is mass destruction with a maximum loss of human life. There is no explanation as to why the aliens chose to invade and conquer at that specific time (although I think I can guess what Wells' intention was), so we are left with just a bunch of death.Additionally, certain parts of the movie were way too contrived. They are driving down the highway and despite all the cars stopping at the same time, there seems to be a pathway for Cruise to drive down. Or many army vehicles driving to attack the aliens, when all of a sudden there is an explosion and many of the vehicles are, uh yeah, suddenly on fire driving back over the hill towards them. I could go on, but it would seem pointless, kind of like the movie. Spoiler ahead, and what was with the ending? Even though the movie was pointless, the ending made it even more so. The children's mom and grandparents are alive and unscathed, in a building not even touched. And, here is the kicker, the son who walked over the hill and into an eventual flaming ball of fire and mass destruction, is suddenly back in Boston with his grandparents? Huh?As I said, the movie was pointless and it went nowhere. The storyline was a bit too forced, making characters act in unbelievable ways in order to build up to the desired scene. Alas, the only good that came of this movie was the special effects, which was astonishing. Because of that, a two star. Do not rent this movie or buy it.

635009,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B00005JNTI,Brian,"[0, 0]","Well, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed this film.I generally don't go out of my way to see ANYTHING with Tom Cruise because, admittedly, something about the man plain and simply gets on my last wick.That as it may be, I still found much to savor in this dark rendering of the H.G. Wells story. Aside from the added broken family back-story to Tom's character, the main overall plot from the novel is essentially intact. It's just been updated to fit a modern-day framework. Everything from the red weed to the classic tripod war machines that H.G. Wells envisioned over one hundred years ago finally receives its proper due in all the larger-than-life spectacle you could ever imagine.Many here have taken issue with the grainy look to the film, citing it as a major pratfall of the subsequent DVD and Blu-Ray releases. But the well documented fact remains that Steven Spielberg deliberately shot the movie this way. It adds a dimension of gritty realism, an underlying tone of despair and impending doom if you will. Another random point of discourse I've noticed among other more recent reviewers concerns the ending. People, who claim to be fans of the novel and Byron Haskin's 1953 original film, seem disappointed by the manner in which the martians meet their eventual end. I guess that puzzles me because Spielberg's ending here is really no different than Haskin's or, for that matter, that of the 1938 Mercury Theater On The Air's presentation. The ending to ""The War of the Worlds"" has pretty much been considered common knowledge to anybody in the know from Day One. So I can't help but find it altogether amusing that an alleged ""fan"" would suddenly have a problem concerning the ending to this specific interpretation.But, oh well. Guess you can't please everybody.I would still recommend this film to anybody looking for a darker, more edge-of-your-seat adaptation.

This DVD has a short documentary about the aliens, but that is pretty lame for a Steven Spielberg BLOCKBUSTER movie, one of the biggest films of the year, to only give you one short documentary as the only bonus on the regular priced DVD!This is a good movie but it is seriously hampered on DVD by the uncool trend of releasing big movies on DVD and making you pay $10 extra for the bonus disk of documentaries and extras, which used to be FREE with these big movie releases! This is further aggravating in that they do NOT charge less for the stripped down DVD version, but still charge full price, which used to include that extra DVD of freebies.CONSTANTINE, and BATMAN BEGINS are two other good movies that are a rip-off on DVD, for this same situation of having a full price, bare bones version, or an expensive version with the extra disk.As we are all more digital and computer savvy, we all know that it doesn't cost much to make mass quantities of these DVDs. The mark-up is HUGE! This is most prevalent in the music industry, and how more folks just burn their own CDs, rather than pay rip-off prices for a factory made CD. It's DIGITAL, there is no difference in the quality of the DIGITAL information!I would have gladly given this WAR OF THE WORLDS DVD a 5 star rating, if they had only not tried to rip-off their consumers, and had given us the movie AND the extra bonus disk, at regular price, like it used to be, a year of so ago.If you want the bonus disk for WAR OF THE WORLDS, you must pay over $20 (and that is the supposed, commonly discounted price that most sell it for). And from what I can tell by the description of the 2 disk version, they don't even have a Director's Commentary for the movie. What a rip-off.Disappointing. 1 star is all it's worth to me.In contrast, you should instead buy the 1950's version of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS on DVD, freshly released in 2005, which the studio did VERY RIGHT, for all the opposite reasons that make the Spielberg DVD of  WAR OF THE WORLDS such a price rip-off!The newly released 1950's version on DVD has tons of extras, two different commentary tracks, including the two lead actors, and lots of documentary material, and they charge a very reasonable price for this single disk gem of a DVD, under $15, I think I paid $10! Get the 1950's version on DVD before this 2005 version.",1,"Good Movie, Lame DVD Bonuses are a Rip-Off!",1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,2941,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'theater', 'bought', 'frills', 'DVD', 'Full', 'Screen', 'version', 'watching', 'home', 'feel', 'are', 'ripping', 'off', 'raising', 'price', 'big', 'movies', 'released', 'DVD', 'films', 'Full', 'Screen', 'version', 'miss', 'important', 'details', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'qualms', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'movie', 'least', 'not', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'shape.Tom', 'Cruise', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'really', 'cute', 'niece', 'way', 'DVD', 'short', 'documentary', 'aliens', 'pretty', 'lame', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'BLOCKBUSTER', 'movie', 'one', 'biggest', 'films', 'year', 'only', 'give', 'one', 'short', 'documentary', 'only', 'bonus', 'regular', 'priced', 'DVD', 'good', 'movie', 'seriously', 'hampered', 'DVD', 'uncool', 'trend', 'releasing', 'big', 'movies', 'DVD', 'making', 'pay', '10', 'extra', 'bonus', 'disk', 'documentaries', 'extras', 'used', 'be', 'FREE', 'big', 'movie', 'further', 'aggravating', 'do', 'NOT', 'charge', 'less', 'stripped', 'DVD', 'version', 'still', 'charge', 'full', 'price', 'used', 'include', 'extra', 'DVD', 'freebies.CONSTANTINE', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'good', 'movies', 'are', 'rip-off', 'DVD', 'same', 'situation', 'having', 'full', 'price', 'bare', 'bones', 'version', 'expensive', 'version', 'extra', 'disk.As', 'are', 'more', 'digital', 'computer', 'savvy', 'know', ""n't"", 'cost', 'much', 'make', 'mass', 'quantities', 'DVDs', 'mark-up', 'HUGE', 'most', 'prevalent', 'music', 'industry', 'how', 'more', 'folks', 'just', 'burn', 'own', 'CDs', 'rather', 'pay', 'rip-off', 'prices', 'factory', 'made', 'CD', 'DIGITAL', 'difference', 'quality', 'DIGITAL', 'information', 'would', 'have', 'gladly', 'given', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'DVD', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'had', 'only', 'not', 'tried', 'rip-off', 'consumers', 'had', 'given', 'movie', 'extra', 'bonus', 'disk', 'regular', 'price', 'used', 'be', 'year', 'so', 'ago.If', 'want', 'bonus', 'disk', 'WAR', 'OF', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'must', 'pay', '20', 'supposed', 'commonly', 'discounted', 'price', 'most', 'sell', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'description', '2', 'disk', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'movie', 'What', 'rip-off.Disappointing', '1', 'star', 'worth', 'me.In', 'contrast', 'should', 'instead', 'buy', '1950', 'version', 'THE', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'DVD', 'freshly', 'released', '2005', 'studio', 'did', 'VERY', 'RIGHT', 'opposite', 'reasons', 'make', 'Spielberg', 'DVD', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'price', 'rip-off', 'newly', 'released', '1950', 'version', 'DVD', 'tons', 'extras', 'two', 'different', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'including', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'lots', 'documentary', 'material', 'charge', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'single', 'disk', 'gem', 'DVD', '15', 'think', 'paid', '10', 'Get', '1950', 'version', 'DVD', '2005', 'version']",N/A

635015,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JNTI,Caleb Williams,"[1, 3]","One thing I will always do when watching a film of this kind is always look for the positives as, let's face it there isn't going to be many. Being a Stephen Spielberg picture, there was a lot that this movie could have offered, seeing as he's considered a Sci-Fi directing legend (in my eyes anyway). The War of the Worlds legacy is a massive one with the original H.G. Wells novel in 1898, the 1938 radio broadcast that led to a few people committing suicide due to them thinking the world really was being invaded by Aliens. Then we had the 1953 movie which gained high levels of critical acclaim along with an Oscar for its epic special effects, and most recently we had the Spielberg adaptation.What are the differences between Spielbergs version and the 1953 classic and the novel itself? Well one of the main factors are where the aliens come from and how they got here are a big change. As is regularly used in Alien movies, there is usually a lot of information given about the background of the Aliens and their possible intentions. Not in this movie, anyone who has read the book will know that these are aliens that have come from Mars, and are feeding off humans through direct blood transfusions of sorts. There is none of that in this movie as it follows a man and his family and their basic quest to survive. Oh, and no meteors are involved in the transporting of the alien beings.This adaptation follows the life of blue collar worker Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) during this difficult time for humanity. One day his ex wife or girlfriend, I'm not sure, drops off his kids to stay for the weekend. His son who's about 16 let's say, Robbie (Justin Chatwin) doesn't get along with him too well and is clich&eacute; number 2 with the broken family being the first. Then there's the daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) whos name is repeated so much, you will feel compelled to call one of your children that. She's clich&eacute; number 3 being the screechy annoying reason people are constantly in trouble and actually makes a lot of things worse with her panicky behaviour.On the day the kids are dropped off, news reports start coming in about electrical thunder storms that knock out every electrical device in the surrounding area. One of these electrical storms strike quite close to home and Ray goes to investigate, but before this situation Robbie goes missing in Rays car (rebellious teen, clich&eacute; number 4). At the scene of the storm hitting, strange things begin to happen and a circular hole in the ground opens up and out pops a large tripod machine that starts blowing people up into dust, actual dust. The film then culminates into a lot of running and self discovery as relationships build, personalities change etc. etc. Clich&eacute;s galore really.2005 to many for Tom Cruise will be considered the start of his crazy guy years, with all his jumping about and sickening enthusiasm. Even for Americans, Toms enthusiasm was too much and could have been something that destroyed this film financially. Fortunately for Spielberg the film was a financial success with pulling in over $500 million, but critically it wasn't so good. This is the same with my review as apart from the odd cool bit here and there, and featuring some of my favourite actors, I just felt this film to be tiresome and a bit too ridiculous at times.Of course, you can't expect a film about Alien invasion to be too serious but there has to be that element there, and there were just occasions I found the atmosphere of the film be destroyed by the odd thing. One example would be at the start of the film when the Aliens first reveal themselves, Ray manages to find a working car and gets the son and daughter in and are frantically driving away from the chaos. Rachel is quite obviously screaming at the terrifying situation, but the way she is calmed down by her brother I just found to be absolutely ridiculous and took a lot away from the moment. Another scene on the ferry boat gave a ""that's my boy"" moment when Robbie was saving people from falling overboard. Considering the scene and the situation, it was again something that took a lot away from the possible terror of themoment.Possibly the only redeemable feature of the film is the special effects which are at times flawless. These are obviously Spielbergs strong points and they show in this as he wields his special effects magic on the tripods. Tom Cruise is of course brilliant, and although his life outside of the film may have had some form of affect on the success of the film, there's no doubting he let his personality get in the way of his acting ability. Justin Chatwin was also a delight in this film and he's truly one of the current day up and comers, much like Shia Labeouf he is going to be massive soon. The entire chemistry was dragged down by Dakota Fanning, as the only contribution she made was to scream a lot and have her characters name yelled a lot. It's made even more annoying when looking at when the film was released, how much people were praising this child for her good acting. She is talented, but she ruined this movie for me.I would only really recommend this film to the die hard Speilberg or Cruise fans, as that's generally the only real delight you'll get out of this. I suppose Spielberg was looking to make as big an impact on todays society with his incarnation than the 1953 film had on that society and movie industry. Apart from the scenes where the tripods featured heavily, this film just fell flat on its face. It lacked any sort of depth, but clouded that fact with so many clich&eacute;s and stupid moments you simply didn't notice the characters were as shallow as a South African pond.",2,A War Of

When staggering alien mechanical constructions of doom rain disintegrator rays on the fleeing human populace, Rachel screams, ""Is it the terrorists?""More punch is felt on the collective conscious when Ray arises from a house basement to find a plane crashed in front of him.  But perhaps the most striking picture is the runaway fiery train roaring by the protagonist family.  These images hit the situational home run.  These are horrors we're familiar with.  The trick is to get the film's spectacular horror to ring just as soundly.Unfortunately, I just didn't believe the aliens.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by recent special effects films.

Let's cut the ending some slack.Spielberg is often criticized for over-sentimentalizing his films' endings and going too far over the top. Like ""A.I."" and others, ""War of the Worlds"" has not escaped such complaints. I admit I was initially shocked by the level to which Spielberg asked that I suspend my disbelief, but after reflecting on the film as a whole, I've decided this isn't a problem for me. After all, during the film's run-time we've seen countless numbers of people not just killed, but utterly annihilated. We've seen buildings crushed and families torn apart. As far as his ending is concerned, Spielberg pulls no punches and goes for a solid emotional knock-out, which either works for you or does not.

The thing in War of the Worlds is the aliens. These aliens are brutal and show no mercy. They kill every human in sight and are smart. They are hard to kill. But this movie is really a sci-fi action thriller but mostly action. It actually starts in the begining.It's Saving Private Ryan with aliens except without the blood and gore and language. This is very intense. For example, shortly after the begining after a storm, something comes out of the ground. It's a big spaceship and a few seconds later,it fires a laser and starts blowing up any target it finds.Yes they are that brutal and they don't take crap. There are some comedy events in the movie and the special effects are the best. Anyone should see this movie at all costs! The action was better than I expected. WOTW will have you at the edge of your seat and will give you an intense movie. It's not dissapointingand to me, greatest movie since Saving Privtae Ryan. The aliens on Earth force people to make desperate measures for examples.1.Tom Cruise and the kids are in a van and are driving and people are everywhere. They actually try to kill them by hitting windows. Like this one part when there's a big hole in the windshield, this dude actually tries to break in by ripping the glass off with his bare hands!2.In the same scene, this guy robs Cruise with a gun and Cruise drops his gun. The dude takes the car and some dude grabs Cruise's gun and kills the guy who took Tom's car and everyone's trying to kill each other. I wouldn't recommend this movie for little kids or sensetive kids. They would get scared.2 thumbs way freakin' up!

I do think the ending was too sudden but then the book did it that way, too.  The movie stayed faithful to the book, in that we get to see just one poor guy (or family, in this case) and how he reacts to the invasion.  The acting is really, really good although there were some weak points in the story (I don't think the Tim Robbins character, although well-acted, added anything to the story).  The special effects are simply awesome, and I am so glad that Mr. Spielberg stuck with the walking fighting machines of the book.  I couldn't figure out how a three-legged mechanism might gracefully walk, but the moviemakers got it!  Others will have different opinions, but I think the main points of the classic book were well-covered.  Maybe the social commentary didn't make it in there, and I am glad.  Too many moviemakers feel like they need to educate me on something, and I am glad the urge was resisted in this case.  I think, overall, that Mr. Wells would be happy with this adaptation of his novel.

635029,A18NB6VKNXHV7O,B00005JNTI,"Chris D. Bates ""Dave, the Man!!!""","[1, 4]","I think this movie is ABOUT September 11th. It isn't just drawing on the imagery or providing a parallel to the political situation [as you might find in Episode III or Batman Begins], I think this movie is a full-on processing of 9/11, in the only way you can currently make a movie about 9/11: using metaphor and indirection.Certain elements are directly parallel: from visuals of buildings collapsing, airplanes fallen from the sky, walls lined with ""missing"" posters, and especially the snowfall of ash and clothes that occurs during several scenes, to thematic elements, such as the question of whether it is preferable to seek revenge although it would mean more deaths, or simply to attempt to survive in the aftermath. There is talk about how an ""occupation never works,"" and Tom's son is doing a paper on the French occupation of Algeria. Later in the film, Tom has to try to convince his son not to join the Army, as it would be throwing his life away in a pointless war. Yep, you got 9/11, and it's right there on your movie screen.I happened to be on vacation the week of 9/11, returning five days after the attack, while the rubble was still burning. I didn't see the attack in person, but I saw the walls of ""missing"" posters, precisely as depicted in this film. You could literally feel the psychic tension increase the closer you came to downtown. Me and several of my friends reported suddenly bouts of crying happening at least once an hour. I worked in a building nearby that summer, and saw the pile of rubble from the towers that looked just like a big dump--until I saw a tiny person at the base of that pile, and realized that that pile of rubble was at least 10 stories high. I watched the attacks on television as they happened. The amazing thing was that they looked SO MUCH like special effects. I had no idea that the special effects I had been watching were so realistic! I had to turn off the TV after a very short time, because the more I watched it, the less real it became. One of the few moments that seemed real was when the second tower was collapsing, but the news commentator, possibly because of some technological delay, wasn't commenting on it yet.As I watched War of the Worlds, I kept thinking ""Why would someone, especially anyone who was in New York around 9/11, want to watch this?"" I think the answer comes in the form of one of Hitchcock's cardinal rules for creating suspense: that the audience should identify with the main characters--but not too much. He believed that it is crucial that the audience remain aware, on some level, that they are sitting safely in an auditorium watching a movie. The incredibly intense experience of watching imagery so familiar from the 9/11 while safely eating popcorn in an air-conditioned movie theater is powerfully cathartic. It allows us New Yorkers a way to process the terror and confusion we felt--from a safe distance.When I was a video clerk at a Borders Books and Music store, I remember looking at a video that included the famous footage of the Kennedy assassination. The copy on the back of the box said something to the effect of: ""Relive the horror of that terrible tragedy again and again!""I thought this movie was incredible. The sheer precision of the direction was amazing. As I was watching it, it occurred to me that Spielberg truly is heir to Hitchcock in terms of his skill at telling a story by purely visual means, the economy and efficiency of his shots and editing, and how he is able to make a story exciting almost entirely through technique. That this story involves the inclusion of several very complex effects only makes his technical achievement that much greater.Spielberg very cannily keeps his special effects--and these are the very best special effects money can buy--in the periphery of most shots, which very effectively ups their realism and the sense of their integration with the characters. For example, one shot shows Cruise looking up, while we see the approaching alien ship reflected in the windshield of the car next to him. Contrast this to something like The Day After Tomorrow, in which you have the special effects shots and the character reaction shots, which are usually two very separate things.Many reviewers have picked out the mysterious fact that the one car Tom picks out magically works, when all of the others don't. Upon seeing this movie again, I see that there is an explanation for this. That is the car that Tom suggested a way to fix to the mechanic, and presumably the mechanic fixed it while the first tripod was appearing. This also explains why Tom knew to go right to that particular car. It's almost charming that Spielberg thinks that most people will be paying attention to this, particularly when distracted by mass scale destruction! Nevertheless, this doesn't explain the miraculous way the car survives without a scratch when a jet airliner crashes and destroys and entire neighborhood.One of the sequences I have seen derided as being lugubrious or somewhat pointless is the scenes in which Tom and Dakota hole up in the basement with Tim Robbins. Sure, Tim may be getting a little comfortable in his nutso basement dweller routine, but I think that this section contains THE most critical content of the movie, and that is its critique of the way politics have played out in the post-9/11 world. Outraged that the aliens should DARE to attack humans [it's just not right!], Tim, with his single shotgun, is under the delusion that the humans can rise up and show these aliens a thing or two. He has no plan except for the righteousness of his desire to stand up. Tom has to stop him, as he knows that if Tim makes a sound, he [and Tom and his daughter] will be instantly killed. Not to mention that it wouldn't accomplish anything. I think this creates a fairly compelling parallel with the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq war... How many of us, if we could go back, wish we could choose not to pursue a course of senseless retaliation that has done nothing but destroy a country and kill more than 1,500 of our troops? At least the Tim character, in the movie, wants to retaliate against someone who actually attacked him.Many of my favorite critics have lauded the technique of this film, but ultimately decided that it is minor Spielberg. I disagree. I think this is major Spielberg in virtually every sense. If you buy into my 9/11 interpretation, it is an important film. It is certainly an emotionally powerful film and a technically masterful film. It has been quite a while since I have been so completely overwhelmed by a movie. In allowing viewers to reprocess the terror and confusion of 9/11 from the safety of their seats, and placing it within a context that can be thought about without the crazed emotional outbursts that prevent the real issues that arise from the attacks from being discussed, it's almost as though he has delivered us a nationwide therapy session.",3,Relive the terror of 9/11 again and

635030,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B00005JNTI,Chris,"[5, 12]","Theres something that amazed me about this film.  I read that they started shooting this film in November of 2004.  Thats at most about 7 months ago.  You would figure that means that actual shooting only took a month or so.  You would figure that a movie that was shot that quick would be terrible.  But most films like that aren't directed by Steven Spielberg, don't star Tom Cruise and don't have a 180 million dollar budget.  Guess what, this movie turned out fantastic.The basic premise of this movie that aliens are trying to take eliminate the human race and take over Earth.  The actual story is about a dockman named Ray (Cruise), and how he trys to solve his dysfunctional relationship with his kids while trying to save their lives.  Most of the movie involves humans trying at any mean possible to survive an alien invasion.The thing that made this movie great is that it brings back a meaning to the term ""edge of your seat thriller.""  This movie actually makes you nervous, uneasy and keeps you guessing throughout.  This movie does what most horror flicks are supposed to do, but this one really isn't too scary.  Another surprise about this film is that it is incredibly gory for a PG-13 rated film.  This movie shows aliens draining blood from dead bodies and spraying it in the air and onto the ground.  Also this film show how inhuman humans can be when they are put into survival situations.  This is a great example of one of Spielberg's ""Popcorn Movies.""  He does a great job of creating suspense, sort of like he did in ""Jaws.""  Tom Cruise gives one of the best performances of his career, which will be overshadowed by his recent media antics.  The special effects are amazing, but thats what we've come to expect with Spielberg films.  This movie was basically perfect up until the ending.  The ending was good, but it could have been a lot better.  Thats really the only flaw in this movie, but it really does not take away from the film.So I guess that Spielberg is done showing the good side of aliens.  Theres no Reeses Pieces in this film and it easily earned its PG-13 rating.  This is definitely the film to see if you're into great action films or if you're a Sci-Fi buff.

635031,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00005JNTI,Chris Kennison,"[2, 7]","There are two kinds of directors in Hollywood... well, at least for this comparison, but there are the PEOPLE WANT TO SEE EXPLOSIONS and DEATH directors and there are STORYTELLER directors. Spielberg is mostly a storyteller director and most of the time he finds JUST the right amount of EXPLOSION and DEATH to make him a cut above the rest.This is a tough review because honestly, I'm a little older (36), so I have a taste for the classic movies, like the original WAR OF THE WORLDS (cheesy sci-fi classic) and the original Orson Welles Radio Broadcast that terrified the ENTIRE NAIVE COUNTRY in 1938. Although, I can't believe I'm gonna say it, but I think Spielberg actually missed some royal opportunities here and made a very disappointing movie.Instead of trying to faithful to the original source and the original MOVIE, I believe that Spielberg would have faired better had he stuck to the ORIGINAL RADIO BROADCAST'S intent.TO SCARE!Some very effective and scary Aliens, along with some very effective movie moments were wasted with a script and a story that seemed to land in the mud at about the 2/3 point.I was into the movie, enjoying the atmosphere, the cinematography, the acting and the frights and then the movie got really coincidental and fell to a screeching halt when Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and and his daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning), settled into the basement of a house with Democratic Activist Tim Robbins (sorry, everytime I see him now, that's all I see).I'm not gonna go into specifics, but that's when the coincidences and cliche's start to flow like free water. When the aliens came into the basement, looking for their prey, I thought... I've seen this before... oh yeah... it was way too similar to the scene with the raptors from Jurassic Park... with the relexion and the mirror...Then came the final thorn in the side... the INDEPENDENCE DAY ending. What?  The movie is called WAR of the worlds and there was very little war. There was actually a lot of hiding and getting lucky.This is where I thought they should have deviated from the previous tales and GIVEN US SOMETHING NEW!! You're waiting for the SPIELBERGish extravaganza ending and it was more like a slow hissing gas leak.I thought the movie was really really rushed and some mistakes were made. This could have been a classic. This could have been remembered along with some of the great sci-fi movies of the past, but some critical mistakes were made.Now... uhh...

Tom Cruise is basically  an incompetent father, and Dokata Fanning his daughter, and the movie takes little time before they're on the run from these seemingly unstopable creatures who just want to destroy everything. It's the destruction that causes you're stomach to queeze that this movie does right. In Independence Day, I think a lesser film, there seemed to be little personalitzation or emotion to the mass slaughter of human beings. On that note this film puts you more into the pain that these aliens cause. The ending is rediculous, and don't expect that great of a storyline.

Dakota Fanning was phenomenal.  I thought the original version played a little better, it was also a sign of its time, just as this version is.

The original was so good for so long, how can you want to remake such a classic?  But it was done very well.  And this is saying something; I hate remakes.  I am a purist when it comes to certain things.  It would be like someone remaking the original Star Wars or Casablanca.  When you have such fond memories of the original, you do not want anyone trying to reinterpret it.  But, like I say, it was very well done.  It was not a rehash of the original, it was its own movie, based on a common story.  Or, it's a reinterpretation of a story based on now 50 years of cultural change.

It's clear the New York terrorist attacks inspired this darkness, and Spielberg has utilized every ounce of his creativity to produce a haunting statement on the end of the world.When watching this at the theater, I was equal parts disturbed and awestruck. Spielberg got so much right during the first hour, including an approaching thunderstorm striking a deep instinctive chord within anyone who has witnessed a tornado. The funnel appears as if by magic, strolling across the prairie like a mythic giant destroying everything within its path. What is so terrifying about witnessing such a bone-chilling phenomenon is the tornado is so gigantic, as if a demonic God is walking the earth obliterating every soul.Spielberg has perfectly recreated such hopeless insignificance, as the alien machines rise from the ground belching exhaust, standing insanely tall against a darkening sky. Human beings are suddenly minuscule, very much akin to miniature victims falling from burning skyscrapers. Spielberg's greatest achievement with ""War of the Worlds"" is his panicked victims react exactly as they would if this happened in real life. Well, on second thought, perhaps it did on Sept. 11, 2001.I have read H.G. Wells equally creepy novelThe War of the Worlds, itself inspired by the fear of approaching industrial world wars. I was also terrified as a child when watching the brilliant 1953 filmThe War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition), with spectacular, Oscar-winning special effects. To Spielberg's great credit, he has gone to earnest lengths to honor both works, remaining essentially true to the novel with respectful nods to the fearsome film. Filmmakers today would throw such history aside.Tom Cruise plays a divorced New Jersey dock worker who has his kids (Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin) for the weekend. He has little time for his seathing offspring, forcing them to order out food and sleeping days in preparation for the night shift. In a series of beautifully directed scenes which should be studied in any film class, a monstrous thunderstorm crawls across the sky with unusual lightning knocking out electricity, cell phones and automobiles. Stranded without modern conveniences, hundreds of spooked neighbors walk down the block to view a mysterious hole in the street. Preceded by a series of seismic tremors, an alien machine rises from the ground and suddenly begins destroying everything that moves. Cruise and his children flee the city en route to his ex-wife's home. Traveling cross country, they witness dead bodies, panicked riots and desperate branches of the American military attempting to battle the invading machines. This journey is just about the most terrifying and emotionally draining series of scenes ever filmed.Sadly, the film grinds to a halt when Cruise and his daughter hole up in a farm basement with rural eccentric Harlan (Tim Robbins), a similar character from Wells's novel. I like the budding father-daughter relationship between Cruise and Fanning, brought on by unimaginable crisis as they tremble with barely-suppressed panic. Cruise's character evolves, as he embraces the core of a responsible father trying to protect his kids amidst catastrophe. I could have done without Robbins's character, a derivative and disposable nut. I also disliked the surprise appearance of an important character at film's end. The distressing travels of Cruise and his children should have continued as they struggled to remain a meager family unit.When compared to the thematically similarIndependence Day, Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" is practicallyMetropolis (Restored Authorized Edition). Great contemplation and artistry went into this work, and the first hour is so incredibly realized the power-down that follows is simply an accessory. This underrated film is Spielberg's most shockingly nihilistic vision. It may not be his greatest film, but it's an example of a great American director tapping the deepest of modern primal fears.

635042,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00005JNTI,Clare Quilty,"[8, 12]","Like the invaders it depicts, ""War of the Worlds"" is a big, beautifully loud, intimidating machine that -- when you crack it open -- is driven by something surprisingly small and unimpressive.The first 45 minutes or so of this movie are thrilling and dread-inducing.  Spielberg still knows how to gradually build suspense and how to say a lot with very little.Once the film becomes a road movie, however, it loses its focus and immediacy.  I don't want to reveal too much plot, but sequences unfold and by the time they conclude, they've run out of gas.  The minivan giveaway, the pointless trip on the ferry, the interlude with Ogilvie all feel like they should fire up brighter but never quite do.The obviously intentional 9/11 parallels don't really work, either.  The people are awfully blase for the first few hours but in less than a day, they've become notice-posting, sign-carrying mobs ready to kill for a working vehicle.There've been a lot of complaints about the ending.  I actually thought it was OK, better than a climatic showdown, but it didn't feel paced properly.  I have a feeling that if Spielberg hadn't had to rush through the postproduction, he would've eventually tightened the sequencing so the conclusion didn't feel so out-of-left-field.It doesn't soar as high as ""Close Encounters,"" it doesn't sink as low as ""A.I."" (though, speaking of clunky endings, few films do) but for something with a production budget of more than $180 million (its advertising and distribution costs will shove it far past $200 million) it should've been allowed enough time to mature and be revised, especially considering it's one of the most expensive movies ever made.",3,Excellent opening but gradually grows less and less compelling,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,1676,"['invaders', 'War', 'Worlds', 'big', 'beautifully', 'loud', 'intimidating', 'machine', 'when', 'crack', 'open', 'driven', 'something', 'surprisingly', 'small', 'unimpressive.The', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'are', 'thrilling', 'dread-inducing', 'Spielberg', 'still', 'how', 'gradually', 'build', 'suspense', 'how', 'say', 'lot', 'very', 'little.Once', 'film', 'road', 'movie', 'however', 'focus', 'immediacy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'sequences', 'unfold', 'time', 'conclude', ""'ve"", 'run', 'gas', 'minivan', 'giveaway', 'pointless', 'trip', 'ferry', 'interlude', 'Ogilvie', 'feel', 'should', 'fire', 'up', 'brighter', 'never', 'quite', 'do.The', 'obviously', 'intentional', '9/11', 'parallels', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'people', 'are', 'awfully', 'blase', 'first', 'few', 'hours', 'less', 'day', ""'ve"", 'become', 'notice-posting', 'sign-carrying', 'mobs', 'ready', 'kill', 'working', 'vehicle.There', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'complaints', 'ending', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'OK', 'better', 'climatic', 'showdown', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'paced', 'properly', 'have', 'feeling', 'Spielberg', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'rush', 'postproduction', 'would', ""'ve"", 'eventually', 'tightened', 'sequencing', 'so', 'conclusion', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'out-of-left-field.It', ""n't"", 'soar', 'as', 'high', 'Close', 'Encounters', ""n't"", 'sink', 'as', 'low', 'A.I', 'speaking', 'clunky', 'endings', 'few', 'films', 'do', 'something', 'production', 'budget', 'more', '180', 'million', 'advertising', 'distribution', 'costs', 'will', 'shove', 'far', 'past', '200', 'million', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'allowed', 'enough', 'time', 'mature', 'be', 'revised', 'especially', 'considering', 'one', 'most', 'expensive', 'movies', 'ever', 'made']",N/A
635043,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JNTI,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 6]","Even though you could consider Minority Report similar, War of the Worlds is probably Spielberg's return to that action blockbuster where everything is big and boomy(Report was more of an action film, this is more huge on explosions and nastyness). While it does have a nice return-to-form, it also doesn't have the thing that makes Jaws and other films he's done a classic.Ray Ferrier works at the docks(to this day, I still don't know what those big containers are for) and comes home, only to find he's late to take care of his kids, which are being left in his care for the weekend. Ray was married now she is again and he gets them. Only things get weird as there's an odd lightning storm including lightning hitting the exact spot. What comes out surprises everyone: massive machines that have the power to annihilate houses and incinerate people in practically a second flat.Wanting to get his kids to Boston, he goes towards Boston where his ex-wife lives. So not only is he trying to escape the Tripods, he has to deal with a rebellious teenager anxious to help fight and a daughter who screams really loud and is claustrophobic.His films have always had memorable images: biking across the moon, a massive ship coming from behind a mountain, a giant eyeball peering through a window and his trademark side-view mirror shots like in Jurassic Park and AI. Well this film has several: a rain of clothes, a body of water(a play on words but it's literal) and a train on fire. The shots used are really well-chosen. One problem that pops up though is the image of the film: it's incredibly grainy. Long-time collaborater Janusz Kaminski(since Schindler's List in 1993) is one of the better cameramen but he really needs to learn how to fix his grain because it's really awful in places.Another thing is he has great sequences: the T-Rex paddock, D-Day Invasion or the Truck chase in Raiders, well add another: the intersection scene. This is probably the most suspenseful and exhilarating scenes of the year, let alone his career. Perfect build, the payoffs and really well done. Of course then comes the issue: because it's such an awesome scene, the rest of it kind of drags. It's kind of like the show Lost and it's pilot: the pilot rocks but nothing really matched those 2 first episodes. While the ferry scene is exciting, it's not as visceral as that alien introduction.Now why the ""sort of""? Because lately it seems that he wants to put in messages in his films, or little morals. Jaws worked because there was no moral, it was just 3 guys battling the elements. Here you can make a case it's against man wanting to outdo himself technology-wise and oblivious to other things and we can't forget the obvious 9/11 references. Not to mention plot holes: machines buried for million years yet they didn't detect bacteria? Not to mention it's much-maligned ending where sentimentality and mushiness runs rampant. Remember how ET had an ending where they had to separate but it didn't feel saccharine? Not the case here.It's still an enjoyable romp from someone who knows how to do one.

635046,A2L4VKF6650ZOA,B00005JNTI,Colt,"[1, 2]","That's how many times I said ""Oh my God"" while watching the movie. Spielberg delivers something, unique, here. Most of the movie is just the tripods disintigrating people and buildings but it doesn't feel as hollow as it's supposed to.If you've seen the original or read the book then you pretty much know how it goes. To those who have been living under a gigantic rock, it's a typical alien invasion movie. Our hero, good ol' Tom Cruise, and his kids are in the middle of it all.Many have compared this movie to the one starring Will Smith but I disagree. While that brings in its ""wow"" factor in the form of big explosions and obliterated (inter)national structures, Worlds manages the same thing with as little explosions as possible and barely any destruction. Well, in metropolitan areas. This is a good thing.In my opinion, Worlds is more of a suspense/horror flick than an action movie. It's pretty obvious that the tripods are regarded as monsters. Dakota Fanning screaming for an hour-and-a-half certainly validates that point. With that said, the movie is very fast-paced and loud; think of it as Saving Private Ryan with a hint of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. This is kind of a drawback since it gets a little mind-numbing sometimes but the excellent visuals more than makes up for it. If not, there are those scenes where Tom tries to repair his relationship with his children.The ending is where this film suffers significantly. Not the exact ending (I mean, it would be heresy if Spielberg changes THAT), but towards the end of the movie. In my opinion, it was a bit too action packed, and leading to a mediochre/Hollywood ending, that's not good.

635047,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B00005JNTI,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[5, 8]","Can't say I'm too impressed by this latest offering of Spielberg's. As I walked out of the theater having seen this film I couldn't help but feel empty and cheated of what was promising to be a memorable experience, which it was not.Pretty much everything about the film was mediocre, the acting as well as the story, while the real stars of the film were the CGI and special f/x. Cruise inspired me to have faith in him based on two of his most recent films, 'The Last Samurai' and 'Collateral', so he has proven that he can act extremely well, but he really doesn't have the opportunity to show that in this production. The plot moves along too quickly not really giving any opportunity for him or the supporting cast to engage the audience in their plight to save themselves from the extra-terrestrial invasion. After the film is over, does the audience know who any of these characters really are, or have a better understanding of their morality, humanity? In some ways yes, but it all seems more or less superficial.I can see where the $183 million budget went, but perhaps 1/10 of it should have been spent on a better script. The cast was fine except for Cruise's son, who was just this stereotypical angsty teenager who was completely unlikeable even after he saved some people. He just wasn't believable, at all. Dakota Fanning did a good job as usual, fine young actress, but again, nothing outstanding and not enough to make this film a true success.In regards to the story, it just seemed too Hollywood. It's the old paradox of what seems to be otherwise intelligent people doing consistently stupid things, much like teenagers in horror films. Since the aliens were targeting cities, it would be wise to stay away from major urban areas, and not drive straight through an angry mob that's desperate, cold and starving. It's never a good idea to run up a hill unarmed against a horde of towering, alien giant squid machines. Don't leave your 10 year old daughter out of your sight when hell has broken loose. Etc.Who knows, maybe the biggest problem of the film is the context, as in the original book the story took place a 100 years earlier, whereas this is a contemporary adaption and due to the timeshift, something was lost in translation. I believe in staying true to source material while adding the touch of artistic creativity and passion. The film would have been more compelling and perhaps more emphatic had it taken place at the end of the 19th century, since the technology then was far inferior to ours. In a sense, the feeling of hopelessness would have been driven even further and deeper into the psyche of the audience with early 1900s technology vs. futuristic space age machinery. Also, the setting was originally the Victorian English landscape, which would have been nice to explore since the juxtaposition just seems more appealing than that of our modern 21st century world.The film is not all bad, but it isn't all that entertaining either, and ultimately not memorable at all. Talk about one of the most abrupt and disappointing endings in a long time. All things considered, it's fairly average and definitely not destined to become one of the greatest classics of all time. It's one of those ""popcorn"" flicks that are as easily consumed as they are digested and ultimately disposed of.I give it a 3/5 stars, and a marginal 3 at that.",3,"War of the Worlds, Not As Impressive As Its Title Implies",1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,3375,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'too', 'impressed', 'latest', 'offering', 'Spielberg', 'walked', 'theater', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'empty', 'cheated', 'what', 'was', 'promising', 'be', 'memorable', 'experience', 'was', 'not.Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'film', 'was', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'were', 'CGI', 'special', 'f/x', 'Cruise', 'inspired', 'have', 'faith', 'based', 'two', 'most', 'recent', 'films', 'Last', 'Samurai', ""'Collateral"", 'proven', 'can', 'act', 'extremely', 'well', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'opportunity', 'show', 'production', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'too', 'quickly', 'not', 'really', 'giving', 'opportunity', 'supporting', 'cast', 'engage', 'audience', 'plight', 'save', 'extra-terrestrial', 'invasion', 'film', 'audience', 'know', 'who', 'characters', 'really', 'are', 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'morality', 'humanity', 'ways', 'yes', 'more', 'less', 'superficial.I', 'can', 'see', 'where', '183', 'million', 'budget', 'went', 'perhaps', '1/10', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'better', 'script', 'cast', 'was', 'fine', 'Cruise', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'stereotypical', 'angsty', 'teenager', 'who', 'was', 'completely', 'unlikeable', 'even', 'saved', 'people', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'usual', 'fine', 'young', 'actress', 'again', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'true', 'success.In', 'regards', 'story', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'old', 'paradox', 'what', 'be', 'otherwise', 'intelligent', 'people', 'doing', 'consistently', 'stupid', 'things', 'much', 'teenagers', 'horror', 'films', 'aliens', 'were', 'targeting', 'cities', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'stay', 'away', 'major', 'urban', 'areas', 'not', 'drive', 'straight', 'angry', 'mob', 'desperate', 'cold', 'starving', 'never', 'good', 'idea', 'run', 'up', 'hill', 'unarmed', 'horde', 'towering', 'alien', 'giant', 'squid', 'machines', 'Do', ""n't"", 'leave', '10', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'sight', 'when', 'hell', 'broken', 'loose', 'Etc.Who', 'maybe', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'context', 'original', 'book', 'story', 'took', 'place', '100', 'years', 'earlier', 'contemporary', 'adaption', 'due', 'timeshift', 'something', 'was', 'lost', 'translation', 'believe', 'staying', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'adding', 'touch', 'artistic', 'creativity', 'passion', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'compelling', 'perhaps', 'more', 'emphatic', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'technology', 'then', 'was', 'far', 'inferior', 'ours', 'sense', 'feeling', 'hopelessness', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'even', 'further', 'deeper', 'psyche', 'audience', 'early', '1900s', 'technology', 'vs.', 'futuristic', 'space', 'age', 'machinery', 'Also', 'setting', 'was', 'originally', 'Victorian', 'English', 'landscape', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'explore', 'juxtaposition', 'just', 'more', 'appealing', 'modern', '21st', 'century', 'world.The', 'film', 'not', 'bad', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'ultimately', 'not', 'memorable', 'Talk', 'one', 'most', 'abrupt', 'disappointing', 'endings', 'long', 'time', 'things', 'considered', 'fairly', 'average', 'definitely', 'not', 'destined', 'become', 'one', 'greatest', 'classics', 'time', 'one', 'popcorn', 'flicks', 'are', 'easily', 'consumed', 'are', 'digested', 'ultimately', 'disposed', 'of.I', 'give', '3/5', 'stars', 'marginal', '3']",N/A

While acting ability was not a necessary component in measuring the success of the film, the repugnant Tom Cruise did a pretty decent job as main character Ray Ferrier.  Cruise spent most of the film running from the aliens and headed from New Jersey to hoped for sanctuary in Boston.While Spielberg strayed from the H.G.

The technology used to create the marauding Tripods stampeding through the countryside was excellent.Spielberg added a nice touch in featuring Gene Barry, the main character in the original film, in a cameo role.

635054,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JNTI,Craig Matteson,"[0, 3]","This is another adaptation of H. G. Wells' classic tale from 1898.  It has been a popular tale since its first publication.  In every adaptation it has to be updated to accommodate the changes in technology and in our understanding of our solar system.  The idea of nearby life was possible well into the 20th century.  However, now that we have had several landers on Mars and seen its surface up close, any retelling has to change the source of the aliens to some other source.  In this telling, they just appear and their origins are quite unexplained.  In fact, the speculations within the movie that their machines had been planted for a million years are more silly than explanatory.  Why would they want to wait for humans to evolve in order to conquer the earth?  A million years ago there wasn't any human civilization.  So, what would be their point in waiting?However, as in the original story, the aliens don't come to talk, debate, or even struggle much in their attack on the human race.  In this movie by Spielberg, the aliens are more invincible than in Wells' story and the canisters of black smoke are nowhere to be found.  Tom Cruise is just an ordinary worker where Wells' narrator was a scientist.  Speilberg gives Cruise an ex-wife and two alienated and difficult children to protect as he tries to make his way to his ex-wife to return the kids.  This whole process seems quite odd and contrived to me.  The reasons for the narrator's (and the narrator's brother) travels in the original story make some sense.  However, if I were Cruise's Ray Ferrier and had children to protect (and being a father, I know this) and had a working car, I would be heading to the countryside as far away from the cities and the alien machines as I could.  Of course, this would wreck the story.There are some scenes from Wells' story that are recast and shown in this movie like the boats and what they unexpectedly face on the water.  However, in modern times this makes almost no sense.  And the way Spielberg shows the military attacking the machines is idiotic and would never happen in real life.  Spielberg tells some stories well, the simpler the better.  But this kind of big spectacle is beyond him, I fear.Cruise is ok in this role and the kids do their job.  Everyone likes Dakota Fanning.  Tim Robbins character is not really in Wells' story, but that is no big deal.  He contributes a bit, but that whole should we fight them now and die trying or hide and escape like mice is really a nonsensical issue as far as I am concerned, especially with a young girl in need of protection.The look of the movie is terrific and some of the special effects are marvelous.  However, the changes in the story leave some strange gaps and oddities.  One effective visual effect is when the people are instantly turned to dust by the ray from the machines and their empty clothes come floating down once the air cools.  However, once you stop and think of the temperature it takes to burn a body and how much hotter it is than what it takes to burn clothes, that effective picture becomes embarrassing.Enjoy it if you can.",3,"Some changes are necessary from Wells' story, but not handled all that well here",1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,3126,"['adaptation', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'classic', 'tale', '1898', 'been', 'popular', 'tale', 'first', 'publication', 'adaptation', 'be', 'updated', 'accommodate', 'changes', 'technology', 'understanding', 'solar', 'system', 'idea', 'nearby', 'life', 'was', 'possible', 'well', '20th', 'century', 'However', 'now', 'have', 'had', 'several', 'landers', 'Mars', 'seen', 'surface', 'up', 'close', 'retelling', 'change', 'source', 'aliens', 'other', 'source', 'telling', 'just', 'appear', 'origins', 'are', 'quite', 'unexplained', 'fact', 'speculations', 'movie', 'machines', 'had', 'been', 'planted', 'million', 'years', 'are', 'more', 'silly', 'explanatory', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'wait', 'humans', 'evolve', 'order', 'conquer', 'earth', 'million', 'years', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'human', 'civilization', 'So', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'waiting', 'However', 'original', 'story', 'aliens', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'talk', 'debate', 'even', 'struggle', 'much', 'attack', 'human', 'race', 'movie', 'Spielberg', 'aliens', 'are', 'more', 'invincible', 'Wells', 'story', 'canisters', 'black', 'smoke', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'just', 'ordinary', 'worker', 'where', 'Wells', 'narrator', 'was', 'scientist', 'Speilberg', 'Cruise', 'ex-wife', 'two', 'alienated', 'difficult', 'children', 'protect', 'make', 'way', 'ex-wife', 'return', 'kids', 'whole', 'process', 'quite', 'odd', 'contrived', 'reasons', 'narrator', 'narrator', 'brother', 'travels', 'original', 'story', 'make', 'sense', 'However', 'were', 'Cruise', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'had', 'children', 'protect', 'being', 'father', 'know', 'had', 'working', 'car', 'would', 'be', 'heading', 'countryside', 'far', 'away', 'cities', 'alien', 'machines', 'could', 'course', 'would', 'wreck', 'story.There', 'are', 'scenes', 'Wells', 'story', 'are', 'recast', 'shown', 'movie', 'boats', 'what', 'unexpectedly', 'face', 'water', 'However', 'modern', 'times', 'almost', 'sense', 'way', 'Spielberg', 'military', 'attacking', 'machines', 'idiotic', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'Spielberg', 'stories', 'well', 'simpler', 'better', 'kind', 'big', 'spectacle', 'fear.Cruise', 'ok', 'role', 'kids', 'do', 'job', 'Everyone', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'not', 'really', 'Wells', 'story', 'big', 'deal', 'bit', 'whole', 'should', 'fight', 'now', 'die', 'trying', 'hide', 'escape', 'mice', 'really', 'nonsensical', 'issue', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'especially', 'young', 'girl', 'need', 'protection.The', 'look', 'movie', 'terrific', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'marvelous', 'However', 'changes', 'story', 'leave', 'strange', 'gaps', 'oddities', 'One', 'effective', 'visual', 'effect', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'instantly', 'turned', 'dust', 'ray', 'machines', 'empty', 'clothes', 'come', 'floating', 'down', 'once', 'air', 'cools', 'However', 'once', 'stop', 'think', 'temperature', 'burn', 'body', 'how', 'much', 'hotter', 'what', 'burn', 'clothes', 'effective', 'picture', 'embarrassing.Enjoy', 'can']",N/A

635058,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00005JNTI,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 4]","War of the Worlds is quite a powerful, intense tale guided by master director, Steven Spielberg, who knows how to move things along so fast that you barely notice any inconsistencies in the plot.  As summer entertainment, it serves a tasty dish.  It shows wunderkind director still at the top of his game.A father, Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), gets to keep his two kids for the weekend as his exwife visits Boston.  He barely knows his rebellious teenage son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and is not much better with his younger daughter Rachel (an adorable Dakota Fanning).  Strange phenomena begin to occur over New Jersey as mysterious sounds, lightning, clouds, and wind emanate from the skies.  What follows is the shocking appearance of an alien machine from beneath the ground that shows incredible power and fires deadly rays that disintegrate humans.  Curiosity turns into panic as the machines begin a reign of terror that will destroy the community.  Ray switches to survival mode and thus begins a desperate flight to safety.  What started out as an estranged, dysfunctional group, becomes a frightened, desperate family whose members begin to rely on one another for survival and hope.  And there is not much hope as the aliens are invincible to any military force that can be leveled at them.  Soon it becomes clear that the aliens are also using humans as a living resource.  When they lose contact with Robbie, Ray and Rachel seek refuge in the basement of a farmhouse where a mysterious loner, Ogilvy (Tim Robbins), is willing to make a last stand.  There, they play hide and seek with the aliens.  Eventually Ray and Rachel come face to face with an alien machine, and what Ray does to save his girl and himself leads to the film's climax as it shifts locations to Boston.  .Spielberg pays generous homage to War of the Worlds' three previous incarnations including the original H.G. Wells novel (with its eerie horn-like sounds that precede the aliens, the crazed Ogilvy, the look of the alien machines, and the ending), the Orson Welles 1938 radio broadcast (also set in New Jersey with its unseen news reports and dark mood), and George Pal's 1953 cold war film adaptation (with its apocalyptic destruction and farmhouse sequence).An antithesis of his kinder, gentler alien epics, Close Encounter of the Third Kind and E.T., this film features an evil menace that gives no reason or explanation as to why but rather how quickly the human race can be exterminated.  There are obvious parallels with the Holocaust in the mass extermination of humans which has influenced Spielberg in recent years (Schindler's List).  This has the meanness of his early television movie, Duel, with its relentless enemy.  While there are thematic similarities with Independence Day, by focusing on the one family from beginning to end as opposed to a half dozen groups of characters, Spielberg draws a more intimate portrait of people we care about.What is good about this film is that Spielberg wastes no time and gives enough exposition of Ray's fragmented family before the alien terror begins.  He shows how good he is at suggesting violence.  You get teased with glimpses and sounds of something unusual and frightening before the real threat reveals itself.  Sometimes we only see evidence of massive destruction and death without having the event played out.  It is as if we are standing on the sidelines catching enough of the event to know what is happening.  The film's pacing is very good, and the production values are outstanding. Of significant note, this mega-budgeted film took only seven months to make, an incredibly efficient shoot!  Spielberg knows how to utilize state-of-the-art special effects in an organic, believable way without being artificial or self-conscious of its technique.  The effects, spearheaded by veteran Dennis Muren (Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park), are extremely impressive, and they all look convincing.  Nothing looks phony, and anything that is an effect looks like it is really happening.The acting is strong, and Cruise and Fanning are delightful in their energetic, emotional performances.  Robbins registers in a creepy supporting role, and Miranda Otto (Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King) is effective as Cruise's exwife.  Chatwin (reminding one of a young Jake Gyllenhaal) seems weak and doesn't show enough of his character while interacting with Cruise, but this may be a fault of the script.Surprisingly, the strong emotional ties that characterized E.T. and Close Encounters are not as evident here.  We see Fanning's character traumatized by her surroundings and we see Cruise's character trying to connect with his kids as he fights to save them at every turn.  Spielberg needed a bit more interplay and meaningful dialogue between father and daughter, and it would have been a perfect realization of paternal bonding.The final scene, however, does not ring true regarding the fate of Ray's family-the only glaring fault of the film that seems unrealistic given all that has transpired.  Its resolution seems almost a nod to the classic western, The Searchers.  There are also other film references like a brief scene from The Greatest Show on Earth or a familiar sound effect from the 1953 War of the Worlds.  Watch for cameos of Gene Barry and Anne Robinson near the end; they starred in the 1953 classic.War of the Worlds is a tense, exciting amusement park ride through a scary funhouse, and when it ends, you are glad to have survived the event.",4,"War of the Worlds has `meaner', `rougher' aliens",1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,5508,"['War', 'Worlds', 'quite', 'powerful', 'intense', 'tale', 'guided',

The way the aliens dealt with people was worse than the way people deal with ants. I thought the alien machines did a good job of being overwhelming killing machines. I liked the concept of the machines being here waiting for thousands of years, but I don't think such a thing could exist without any of them ever being found in that much time.I won't write what the movie was about as many others seem to think they need to do since the title description already gives us that.  And I won't compare this to the original movie because I saw that one so long ago I don't remember it well. But I think it's okay to remake a movie after 50 years or so. And this movie played out well. The part where people were willing to kill others to get away is the type of thing that would happen.

635062,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JNTI,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[2, 9]","Let me start by saying a few things about my feelings on movies these days, not that my opinion is all that important, but this is my review so I'm allowed to say whatever I'd like.  First off, Spielberg is great.  Jurassic Park, one word, awsome.  Tom Cruise, not so great, one word, annoying!  Dakota Fanning, a delite to watch on screen.  She's the best part of this movie, by a long shot.  Alien Flics in general, lacking.  Lately they just aren't that good.  It's hard to find a really good alien flic.  Independence Day was great.  I think thats about it.  For the most part they end up dissapointments.  I was sceptical, but then again I was also really excited because fromt he trailer it did look really good.  The story revolves around Ray (Cruise) who is watching his kids for the weekend (Fanning and some other kid)  Thats when war breaks loose.  Lightening strikes the earth sending aliens into the ground to drive the machines they had built and burried under the earth millions of years ago.  It's explained further in the movie.  Anyways, I don't want to spoil to much of the movie, I mean, what more do you need to know other than aliens attack and humans run and scream.  You don't want to know how it ends...that would ruin the whole exp.  All I really wanted to say was that it was really well done.  The special effects were great, the acting was decent, Dakota was amazing, Robbins was convincing, Cruise was beter than expected...I think you will enjoy this film.  It's different than the origional, but that's not a bad thing.  There's one scene in particular that will have movie fans foaming at the mouth.  After Ray and Rachel (Dakota) meet Tim Robbins charactor they are staying in his house and it's invaded by the aliens.  The entire scene, about five minutes or longer in length, is edge of your seat entertainment...perfection and pretty much enough reason to see the movie!!!  Now don't get me wrong here, this movie is far from perfect.  I felt the plot itself, especially the ending, could have been finagled a bit, fluffed and or explained a little better, but other than thatm the movie itself is just fun.  I had a good time.  That's what matters right?  Having fun.

Waldman ""Film Guru""","[1, 3]","Spielberg decided to try to do something different -- make a science fiction movie that often plays down the special effects (showing the lightning strikes in a reflection of a window instead of head on, for example) and plays up telling the story strictly from the point of view of an everyman played by Tom Cruise (miscast, in my opinion,  Kevin Bacon would have done a better job).  M. Night Shymalan tried to do something similar in Signs, but failed when that film degenerated into transforming plot contrivances into religious events.In this movie the audience only gets snatches of information, mostly inaccurate theories.  There are no scientists, Astronomers or high ranking military brass or politicians to explain how the aliens landed, where their ships came from or anything else.  The movie intentionally evokes 9/11 and all of the chaos and paranoia that followed in the 24 hour period.  There were and are plenty of inaccurate crackpot theories out there on both sides of the political spectrum, and the fact that the movie refuses to give the audience a clear explanation is a reflection of that.I remember reading the novel in elementary school and having vivid images of the tall tripods laying waste to London of the 1880s.  Spielberg manages to duplicate those images here, except updated and now in the U.S.This is also the first time that Spielberg has portrayed space aliens as something to be feared, leading me to imagine that perhaps he is starting to become Conservative in his old age, which would be ironic as his self described Conservative friend George Lucas took a couple of jabs at the Republicans in Revenge of the Sith.",4,"This movie succeeds where ""Signs"" failed.",1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,1656,"['Spielberg', 'decided', 'try', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'make', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'often', 'down', 'special', 'effects', 'showing', 'lightning', 'strikes', 'reflection', 'window', 'instead', 'head', 'example', 'up', 'telling', 'story', 'strictly', 'point', 'view', 'everyman', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'miscast', 'opinion', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shymalan', 'tried', 'do', 'something', 'similar', 'Signs', 'failed', 'when', 'film', 'degenerated', 'transforming', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'religious', 'events.In', 'movie', 'audience', 'only', 'snatches', 'information', 'mostly', 'inaccurate', 'theories', 'are', 'scientists', 'Astronomers', 'high', 'ranking', 'military', 'brass', 'politicians', 'explain', 'how', 'aliens', 'landed', 'where', 'ships', 'came', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'intentionally', '9/11', 'chaos', 'paranoia', 'followed', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'were', 'are', 'plenty', 'inaccurate', 'crackpot', 'theories', 'out', 'there', 'sides', 'political', 'spectrum', 'fact', 'movie', 'give', 'audience', 'clear', 'explanation', 'reflection', 'that.I', 'remember', 'reading', 'novel', 'elementary', 'school', 'having', 'vivid', 'images', 'tall', 'tripods', 'laying', 'waste', 'London', '1880s', 'Spielberg', 'duplicate', 'images', 'here', 'updated', 'now', 'U.S.This', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'Spielberg', 'portrayed', 'space', 'aliens', 'something', 'be', 'feared', 'leading', 'imagine', 'perhaps', 'starting', 'become', 'Conservative', 'old', 'age', 'would', 'be', 'ironic', 'self', 'described', 'Conservative', 'friend', 'George', 'Lucas', 'took', 'couple', 'jabs', 'Republicans', 'Revenge', 'Sith']",N/A

It's almost cute, in a freakish nightmare way. If you're not trying to flee onto an already overloaded Hudson ferry, that is.2) The Martian driver of the Tripod, who obviously has a sadistic sense of humor, takes a little pull on the Tripod's airhorn, producing a nasty, throaty, bellicose HOOT that would cause even The Rock to buy a set of Depends.3) People run in holy, shrieking terror, giving the Martian driver a giggle or two.4) Martian Tripod takes its own sweet time, proving, with its heat-ray death beams, that all we are is dust in the wind. The heat-ray goes ZAP!, the unfortunate target sorta goes CHUFF into fluffy ash, and their empty clothes come drifting down. No fuss, relatively little muss.5) Martian Tripod repeats Steps 1-4.This all seems to be great fun if you're the nasty, soupy, tentacled, icky, imperialistic Martians, who are determined *not* to be good houseguests. If you're a screaming, terrorized human in Spielberg's stunning interpretation of the H.G. Wells classic ""War of the Worlds""---well, let's just say it isn't nearly so fun.Spielberg has conjured up a nasty, nihilistic nightmare, and the new ""War"" is roughly two-hours of gut-clenching, undies-soiling a**-kickery on a massive scale. It's an astoundingly visceral, gripping, horrifying film, disarmingly intimate, a ground-zero view of the End of the World as We Know It.And for blue-collar guy Ray Ferrier(Tom Cruise, serving up another solid role playing Tom Cruise)'s already splintering family, they don't feel fine.For an uber-capitalized summer blockbuster, Spielberg has reached back to his revolutionary roots: his camera positions itself alongside Ray, his 8 year old daughter Rachel(the astonishingly stellar, superbly poised, and charismatic Dakota Fanning, who proves herself an accomplished little trooper here), and his sulky son Robbie---and never leaves their sideSpielberg's outting into space-haunted horror pulp fiction is a fine return to form: for most of the flick's two-hour running time, it's a cinematic Shock and Awe campaign.Shock, in that Spielberg wants to terrorize you, to sock you in the gut, to demoralize: and he does just that, through conjuring up war and apocalypse with light and dark, with booming, screeching crescendos of sound puncutated by deep, disorienting wells of ghastly silence, through the sumptuous visual warfare wrought by longtime camera-chief Janusz Kaminski. Or, for that matter, from the pitiless aliens themselves, all slick-skinned meeping horrors mercilessly ravishing the world of Men in invulnerable crafts that are horrifically alien.And then Awe. From the first crackling cannonade of freakish lightning blasts that tear Ray's world apart, to the sight of a Martian warcraft hoisting itself up over the New York horizon, to a hillside glimpse of Tripods riding down a terrified crowd of humans, soon to be annihilated or whisked up into the sky for a round of experimentation and the dreaded anal probe---all of Spielberg's malevolent imagery is tinged with Awe, a dread of the Unspeakable, a black, haunted glimpse into a once-complacent world of the commonplace---baseball, strained relations with the ex-wife---put shoulder-to-jowl with the Gods.But aliens aside, ""War of the Worlds"" truly seethes with damnation and despair in its picture of what Men in the grip of Fear do to each other: there is nothing the Martians offer so bleak as the huddled, forlorn Ferrier family, now stranded, watching their world rip itself apart from the dingy, abandoned darkness of a roadside diner.In the end, the darkness unfurled from this masterpiece---and it is, most assuredly, a wickedly cold and calculating masterpiece---steams up from the sublime indifference into which man is plucked from dominion of the planet and hurled into a shadow-haunted, hunted position as a rat. ""This isn't war, it's extermination"", rasps the shotgun-toting Ogilvy from his makeshift bunker, in the blood-red heart of New Mars.He's exactly right: Man is, for now, marooned on an island in an inky black sea, lord of his dominion by sheer luck. Unlike other pulpy tales of alien aggression, we experience the end of Man from the perspective of one family: in the end, it is only to each other they can cling.For in the end, where to fall back to, where to hear stirring speeches of resistance, if all the castles are overrun, the bridges blown, the cities in flames? There is no cavalry: the cavalry has been scorched. And Man's 'salvation' proves just as arbitrary, just as beyond the pale of Good and Evil, as his Martian overlords.Dust in the wind, indeed.JSG",5,All we are is Dust in the Wind,1126656000,"09 14,

635068,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B00005JNTI,DarthRad,"[5, 6]","Spielberg and crew once again do a bang up job of special effects and storytelling in what turns out to be a standard summer blockbuster.  The visuals are superb in this movie - like his Jurassic Park movies, so much of the really intense sci-fi special effects occur in the background,  almost off-camera, in an understated way that makes it seem even more real and scary.And believe me, this is a scary movie.  I brought my 12-year old and 9-year old, and they were as scared as in any horror movie.  There are some scenes that are particularly horrific because of the clever way that things are presented until it suddenly hits you what is happening.  For example, when Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) looks at himself in the mirror and sees himself covered with all this gray ash, and then starts to violently wash the ash off (yes, have you figured out where that ash came from yet?).  And later on, when he is in the cellar and looks out and sees this fine red mist drifting in, coating his hand.....Spielberg also does a nice job of staying closer to the original book version of the story.So why only 3 stars?  Well, mainly because of poor character development, which results in a film that leaves absolutely no lasting emotional impact - the film simply does not allow you to feel connected to any of its characters.I found Dakota Fanning and/or her character (hard to tell whose fault it was) particularly disappointing - just completely annoying and unrealistic.  OK, OK, so Dakota is supposed to be some sort of a genius actress trapped in the body of a ten year old (now eleven).  I couldn't make any sense of her character.  There were moments where it seemed like Spielberg wanted to let Dakota show off just how awesomely mature she was, and other moments where she was just playing this standard role of a scared little girl screaming her head off.  Then there were moments that called for stronger acting,  e.g., when she sees the dead bodies floating by in the river,  and when she is caught in the headlights of the alien ship, but instead all we get is this blank stunned look.Next most annoying was the Ogilvy character (Tim Robbins).  I have read comments from critics who said that this character was completely pointless, and I would agree.  The Ogilivy character seems to have been put into the movie as filler.  First, the guy rants about surviving no matter what (""dying to stay alive""), then he flips and says he wants to fight the aliens, then he has several chances to actually do something violent against the aliens, but  Ray somehow manages to stop him each time WITHOUT ALERTING THE ALIENS mind you.

I completely agree with all the reviewers who find fault with the method of alien invasion.  Yes, the tripods would certainly have deteriorated after so much time under ground.  Maybe one even would have been dug up by accident.  There is not much reason anyway for burying these war machines for future conquest.  Why not just take over the world at a time before humans had any form of technology?  For that matter, why would bacteria bring down an alien race?  Having survived interstellar travel, we can assume that they have learned how to maintain an air-tight, enclosed environment.  We can also assume that they have the technology and wisdom to test for hostile bacteria in their new environment.In the end, although these problems weakened the film, they did not defeat it because that is not what it is really about.  It is really about the collapse of society and the social contract, which is very relevant in this post 9/11 world.  This take on the classic HG Wells novel is much closer in spirit to Spielberg's own ""Saving Private Ryan"" than the differently excellent George Pal film from the 50s.

635073,AAE2DUEMTR30I,B00005JNTI,DAVID BRYSON,"[254, 330]","The War of the Worlds is a great novel and Spielberg is a director of exceptional talent and accomplishment, so I had been hoping for a lot from this film. In the event, I have got part of what I was hoping for. Very occasionally, a novel can be 'walked' straight on to the screen (The Big Sleep, with a script by Faulkner, is a striking case), and I found myself wondering whether this novel might not have benefited from the same treatment. Some of Spielberg's changes are perfectly reasonable, others less so in my own opinion. It makes perfectly good sense to bring the action forward by a century into the present day, for instance. I suppose there's no harm either in changing the main actors from Wells's scientist with a wife and a brother to a dysfunctional American family, as this may provide enhanced 'human interest' or some such benefit for all I would know. Again, I have no real problem with the way the film combines the roles of the curate and the artilleryman in the book into the single persona of the former ambulance-driver, and I can well understand that Spielberg would have thought it prudent to tone down the socialistic elements in this aspect of the story in order to avoid setting off the wrong types of reaction in American audiences. What I do have a major problem with is the appearance of the Martians themselves. I'm sorry to report that these have far too much in common with a certain wretched TV series. The author's own description is one that stays in the memory, to say the very least, and Wells's Martians look the way they do for very clear reasons that he provides. What was gained by going downmarket in the way Spielberg chooses to do? Nothing that I can think of except perhaps better audience figures from harking back to that ghastly broadcast series.In fact the best things in the film come directly from Wells. Even one of the best lines, where the statement that the invaders come from somewhere else is met with the question 'Where - Europe?' is a very clever adaptation of a good joke in the book comparing the attitudes of Mrs Elphinstone to the Martians on the one hand and the French on the other. The Martian tripods are simply terrific, their appearance lifted more or less exactly from the book. However The War of the Worlds is a work of political and social philosophy and speculation, not just some science-fiction yarn. I really would have liked Spielberg to be a bit more ambitious and reflect this more than he seems to have felt like doing. For one thing, the Martians are invading the earth because their own smaller planet is cooling and dying around them. Wells explicitly says that there is no reason to suppose them 'pitiless'. They have come for pressing practical reasons connected with their own very survival. We know now, as Wells did not, that all they were going to find on Venus is a searing hell under the rolling white clouds, so it would be more than likely, as Wells says again, that they would learn from the failure of their first expedition and come back to the earth better prepared the next time rather than stake everything on one throw, which is what the film seems to be suggesting. The last gesture of the Martians in the film is an expression indicative of hatred, which doesn't even make sense considering they saw us as their food source. What consumer of beef makes hostile faces at beef-herds? The Martians' purpose can't have been 'extermination' as someone is made to say in the film, only subjugation, another matter perfectly clear from the novel.More survives of the view Wells takes of the behaviour of humanity itself, and Spielberg handles the mob-scenes rather well. However what he tones down more than I would have wished is the reflections, in the novel expressed via the persona of the artilleryman, on the likely behaviour of human beings towards one another once the Martian dominion was hypothetically established. The artilleryman's predictions are class-based like the vision of the Eloi and Morlocks in the Time-Machine, but they are far from endorsing Marxism and there is no reason to see them as any firm viewpoint held by the author himself.Perhaps the very best things in the entire film are to be found in the voiceovers right at the start and right at the end. The words are lifted almost verbatim from the novel itself at these points, and they are simply awesome, the first page in particular of The War of the Worlds being surely one of the greatest in all English fiction with the last page not far behind it in that respect. The exquisite irony of the fact that the Martians, who might have viewed us as we view micro-organisms in a laboratory were in their turn thwarted and destroyed by just such organisms when nothing humanity could do availed in the least is obviously not lost on the director. I just wish he had raised his game more consistently to something like the level of the theme he was taking on.",3,ACTION MAN,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,4939,"['War', 'Worlds', 'great', 'novel', 'Spielberg', 'director', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'accomplishment', 'had', 'been', 'hoping', 'lot', 'film', 'event', 'have', 'got', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'Very', 'occasionally', 'novel', 'can', 'be', ""'walked"", 'straight', 'screen', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'script', 'Faulkner', 'striking', 'case', 'found', 'wondering', 'novel', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'benefited', 'same', 'treatment', 'Spielberg', 'changes', 'are', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'others', 'less', 'so', 'own', 'opinion', 'perfectly', 'good', 'sense', 'bring', 'action', 'forward', 'century', 'present', 'day', 'instance', 'suppose', 'harm', 'either', 'changing', 'main', 'actors', 'Wells', 'scientist', 'wife', 'brother', 'dysfunctional', 'American', 'family', 'may', 'provide', 'enhanced', ""'human"", 'interest', 'such', 'benefit', 'would', 'know', 'Again', 'have', 'real', 'problem', 'way', 'film', 'roles', 'curate', 'artilleryman', 'book', 'single', 'persona', 'former', 'ambulance-driver', 'can', 'well', 'understand', 'Spielberg', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'prudent', 'tone', 'down', 'socialistic', 'elements', 'aspect', 'story', 'order', 'avoid', 'setting', 'off', 'wrong', 'types', 'reaction', 'American', 'audiences', 'What', 'do', 'have', 'major', 'problem', 'appearance', 'Martians', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'report', 'have', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'common', 'certain', 'wretched', 'TV', 'series', 'author', 'own', 'description', 'one', 'memory', 'say', 'very', 'least', 'Wells', 'Martians', 'look', 'way', 'do', 'very', 'clear', 'reasons', 'What', 'was', 'gained', 'going', 'downmarket', 'way', 'Spielberg', 'do', 'Nothing', 'can', 'think', 'perhaps', 'better', 'audience', 'figures', 'harking', 'back', 'ghastly', 'broadcast', 'series.In', 'fact', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'come', 'directly', 'Wells', 'Even', 'one', 'best', 'lines', 'where', 'statement', 'invaders', 'come', 'somewhere', 'else', 'met', 'question', 'Europe', 'very', 'clever', 'adaptation', 'good', 'joke', 'book', 'comparing', 'attitudes', 'Mrs', 'Elphinstone', 'Martians', 'one', 'hand', 'French', 'other', 'Martian', 'tripods', 'are', 'simply', 'terrific', 'appearance', 'lifted', 'more', 'less', 'exactly', 'book', 'However', 'War', 'Worlds', 'work', 'political', 'social', 'philosophy', 'speculation', 'not', 'just', 'science-fiction', 'yarn', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Spielberg', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'ambitious', 'reflect', 'more', 'have', 'felt', 'doing', 'one', 'thing', 'Martians', 'are', 'invading', 'earth', 'own', 'smaller', 'planet', 'cooling', 'dying', 'Wells', 'explicitly', 'reason', 'suppose', ""'pitiless"", 'have', 'come', 'pressing', 'practical', 'reasons', 'connected', 'own', 'very', 'survival', 'know', 'now', 'Wells', 'did', 'not', 'were', 'going', 'find', 'Venus', 'searing', 'hell', 'rolling', 'white', 'clouds', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'Wells', 'again', 'would', 'learn', 'failure', 'first', 'expedition', 'come', 'back', 'earth', 'better', 'prepared', 'next', 'time', 'rather', 'stake', 'everything', 'one', 'throw', 'what', 'film', 'be', 'suggesting', 'last', 'gesture', 'Martians', 'film', 'expression', 'indicative', 'hatred', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'considering', 'saw', 'food', 'source', 'What', 'consumer', 'beef', 'hostile', 'beef-herds', 'Martians', 'purpose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', ""'extermination"", 'someone', 'made', 'say', 'film', 'only', 'subjugation', 'matter', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'novel.More', 'survives', 'view', 'Wells', 'behaviour', 'humanity', 'Spielberg', 'mob-scenes', 'rather', 'well', 'However', 'what', 'down', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'wished', 'reflections', 'novel', 'expressed', 'persona', 'artilleryman', 'likely', 'behaviour', 'human', 'beings', 'one', 'once', 'Martian', 'dominion', 'was', 'hypothetically', 'established', 'artilleryman', 'predictions', 'are', 'class-based', 'vision', 'Eloi', 'Morlocks', 'Time-Machine', 'are', 'far', 'endorsing', 'Marxism', 'reason', 'see', 'firm', 'viewpoint', 'held', 'author', 'very', 'best', 'things', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'voiceovers', 'right', 'start', 'right', 'end', 'words', 'are', 'lifted', 'almost', 'verbatim', 'novel', 'points', 'are', 'simply', 'awesome', 'first', 'page', 'particular', 'War', 'Worlds', 'being', 'surely', 'one', 'greatest', 'English', 'fiction', 'last', 'page', 'not', 'far', 'respect', 'exquisite', 'irony', 'fact', 'Martians', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'viewed', 'view', 'micro-organisms', 'laboratory', 'were', 'turn', 'thwarted', 'destroyed', 'just', 'such', 'organisms', 'when', 'nothing', 'humanity', 'could', 'do', 'availed', 'least', 'obviously', 'not', 'lost', 'director', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'raised', 'game', 'more', 'consistently', 'something', 'level', 'theme', 'was', 'taking']",N/A

He's not the best dad in the world, and this has caused a huge rift in his relationship with his daughter, Rachel (Dakota Fanning), and son, Robbie (Justin Chatwin). As they are visiting for the weekend, massive lightening storms breakout across the planet, signaling the beginning of a strange attack that threatens all of humanity.Not knowing what else to do, Ray, Robbie and Rachel join the millions of people trying to run away from danger, but where will they go? Who will survive? What is causing this attack? Can it be stopped?Spielberg has created another classic film we will watch over and over again for years to come because it moves the audience on so many levels. War of the Worlds is visually stunning as we watch mass destruction on a scale and with detail you haven't seen before in movies. It makes Independence Day look like The Muppet Movie as we see entire cities under attack, desperate citizens close to rioting, the indestructible razed to the ground, explosions, fire, and everything we treasure eliminated. All throughout the movie, Spielberg draws you into the middle of it, including chases through the streets, dodging explosions and danger, hiding wherever you can, and frantic driving to get away from danger zones (with some awesome camera work as we move in, out and around the car as it drives down the road). However, Spielberg truly blows us away with the tense, eerie, silent moments, where the audience waits for something frightening to happen, and jumps when it does.Even better, Spielberg and writer David Koepp (based on the novel by HG Wells) brilliantly make us connect with Ray, Robbie and Rachel, which gets the audience emotionally invested in their plight. We see the family dynamics and how a war rages between the three of them as another war rages outside. Koepp does a wonderful job creating a complex web of familial relationships that is a rough, raw portrayal of a family torn apart and how each one tries to function within the fractured system. Fanning makes you ache as she tries to stop the fighting between Ray and Robbie, as well as the horrible fear she feels as unspeakable atrocities are committed around her, while Chatwin makes Robbie more than just an angry teenager. Koepp even finds a few moments to lay down some good dialogue, including a moving moment when Ray is trying to convince the kids everything will be alright, but we know he's just trying to convince himself.Cruise is a compelling lead as he brings determination and inner turmoil to Ray. He plays a convincing cad, showing the audience how Ray's personality can attract and repel, and truly embraces the idea of being a bad father instead of trying to temper the character's faults. Best of all, Cruise lets us see how Ray views the world and what he feels is important, and how it changes while in the middle of Armageddon. Suddenly, the cockiness and anger dissolves into anguish. You see Cruise display Ray's pain as the children reacting to the danger by further cutting him out as well as the character's struggles to say the right thing, but not knowing what it is he should say. You want to jump out of your seat and scream the lines to Ray, which shows you how emotionally involved you have become.

In contrast, I found the 1950s movie of ""War of the Worlds"" to be disappointing, full of Hollywood clich&eacute;s, singing the praises of religion and of the military, etc. -- nothing like Wells' hard-headed, sharp-edged intelligence.The Spielberg film returns in many ways to the sprit of the book, but with the time transposed to the present and with the addition of myriad modern special effects. This requires abandoning Well's basic plot situation of an invasion by Martians, which was based on scientific concepts of Mars that were common at the end of the 19th century but not today. Without Martians to do the invading, Spielberg introduces the silly idea of previously buried alien machines with the creatures themselves arriving on Earth through some unexplained electric phenomena. But no matter -- just look past these initial deficiencies and get on with enjoying an expertly crafted adventure movie.This new film is a lot closer to the sprit of Wells than the 1950s version. One example is the use of the Tim Robbins character as an amalgam of the Artilleryman and the Cleric in the book. Like the book, the film focuses on ordinary people caught in a terrible, incomprehensible catastrophe. Unlike Wells, whose protagonists are adult males, Spielberg takes the modern approach of following a father with two kids, who are buffeted by events they neither understand nor can control. We never get a statement of assurance from the government, the military behave like automatons, all order seems to break down, and for much of the film we don't really understand who or what the aliens are. This is exactly the approach of Wells in his novel. Only at the very end does some understanding emerge.The contrast of this slick, fast-paced Spielberg film with the amateurish new DVD  ""H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds"" could not be greater. This low-budget film is set at the beginning of the 20th century and follows the Wells novel literally. But the result is so sloppy and self-indulgent, and the special effects so poorly executed, that all sense of horror and excitement are lost.",4,"The spirit of HG Wells, with Modern Special Effects",1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,2175,"['novel', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'extraordinary', 'book', '1898', 'contrast', 'found', '1950s', 'movie', 'War', 'Worlds', 'be', 'disappointing', 'full', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 'singing', 'praises', 'religion', 'military', 'etc', 'nothing', 'Wells', 'hard-headed', 'sharp-edged', 'intelligence.The', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'returns', 'many', 'ways', 'sprit', 'book', 'time', 'transposed', 'present', 'addition', 'myriad', 'modern', 'special', 'effects', 'abandoning', 'Well', 'basic', 'plot', 'situation', 'invasion', 'Martians', 'was', 'based', 'scientific', 'concepts', 'Mars', 'were', 'common', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'not', 'today', 'Martians', 'do', 'invading', 'Spielberg', 'silly', 'idea', 'previously', 'buried', 'alien', 'machines', 'creatures', 'arriving', 'Earth', 'unexplained', 'electric', 'phenomena', 'matter', 'just', 'look', 'initial', 'deficiencies', 'get', 'enjoying', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'adventure', 'new', 'film', 'lot', 'closer', 'sprit', 'Wells', '1950s', 'version', 'One', 'example', 'use', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'amalgam', 'Artilleryman', 'Cleric', 'book', 'book', 'film', 'ordinary', 'people', 'caught', 'terrible', 'incomprehensible', 'catastrophe', 'Wells', 'protagonists', 'are', 'adult', 'males', 'Spielberg', 'modern', 'approach', 'following', 'father', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'buffeted', 'events', 'understand', 'can', 'control', 'never', 'get', 'statement', 'assurance', 'government', 'military', 'behave', 'automatons', 'order', 'break', 'down', 'much', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'who', 'what', 'aliens', 'are', 'exactly', 'approach', 'Wells', 'novel', 'Only', 'very', 'end', 'understanding', 'emerge.The', 'contrast', 'slick', 'fast-paced', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'amateurish', 'new', 'DVD', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'War', 'Worlds', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'greater', 'low-budget', 'film', 'set', 'beginning', '20th', 'century', 'Wells', 'novel', 'literally', 'result', 'so', 'sloppy', 'self-indulgent', 'special', 'effects', 'so', 'poorly', 'executed', 'sense', 'horror', 'excitement', 'are', 'lost']",N/A

My gist is: this is a movie that follows pretty closely the book by HG Wells, so if you have a complaint, tell it to him posthumously! The ending that everybody hates? Directly from the book, not to mention the excellent 1953 film. (In fact, how could they possibly have done anything else?!) The basement scene some people felt took away from the action aspect of the film? Directly from the earlier film. The plot, that some felt was too simplistic? That's what the book is about, folks. No rocket science-fiction here....aliens invade earth, and people try to survive. Simple and straightforward. If that weren't the plot of this film then it would not have been called ""War of the Worlds"". Personally, I go to a movie like this to have fun for two hours, and I, like many, had a ball. Was it perfect? No - I was hoping for more tripod destruction scenes, myself! But asking too much out of this kind of popcorn movie is simply setting yourself up for a disappointment.

We don't get the usual Hollywood cliches where the main characters par take in lunkheaded heroics to overcome the protagonist or over-exaggerating the physics (such as were people fly 500 feet across a room when hit).  The aliens here are BELIEVABLE.  The mechanized tri-pods create such a convincing, albeit frightening, look of sheer mass and mobility.Another wonderful aspect of this film is the acting.  Tom Cruise and his kids are top notch with their horrific reactions and instincts - surely people would be scared out of their wits if something like this happened so we experience emotional breakdowns, widespread panic, and sheer desperation.  Dakota Fanning does an exceptional job as we don't have to hear pretentiously tongue-in-cheek lines like 'are you the tooth fairy?'

635087,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B00005JNTI,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[5, 7]","Tom Cruise is an actor, a prophet, and expert in the field of medicine, and now he's an action hero. He's a good one, too. The special effects in ""War Of The Worlds"" are state-of-the-art. So far, everything is great. It's the movie's plot that isn't. One can only watch people run, scream, fire guns, and scream some more for so long. ""War Of The Worlds"" is less of a mature and fully developed movie and more of a long string of ideas only held together by dialogue and the same characters. It's not that this is a bad movie, it's that the writer, David Koepp, wrote half a script, turned it in to the studio (he wrote the first ""Spiderman"", so I wouldn't be suprised that, should he write a sequel to ""Gigli"", they would greenlight it), and then started filming, making things up along the way. The dialogue is very good for the genre, and the special effects are just great, but the movie suffers from not developing the characters enough. The movie starts and establishes the bare basics of the plot. The dad that doesn't pay attention to his kids, the mother that hates the dad, the overly precocious little girl that may die, the teenage son, and the dad's girlfriend who has about one line (""I got your back Ferrier!"" or ""I got ya back Fe''ie'!""). Then, as quickly as the movie started, people are getting vaporized by the alien's machinery. The movie does pull off one skin crawling scene in a basement when the aliens make their first appearance, but aside from that director Steven Spielberg just wants to blow some stuff up. The movie also has absoloutely no levity. No humor to lighten the mood. I suppose this is a good thing, but when the protraganists daughter instinctively ask if terrorists are responsible for what it happening, one can not help but laugh a little. The movie draws many similarities to 9/11, but it never expands on that idea, mostly in favor of more action and violence. The terrorist theme is a good one, and Spielberg keeps it going throughout the movie, mostly in scenes when the army fires endless rounds at the invaders, but as the movie goes into it's third act we see how the idea is lost and then thrown away completely. Dakota Fanning is very good as Cruise's young daughter. All she does is scream, but when you go through everything else she's been through in her short years (a cat invading her house, being kidnapped, and finally having Sean Penn as a father) aliens seem like a small step.The plot, in case you haven't heard already, is about aliens invading the world, first hitting New Jersey (they must have forgot their map). Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a neglectful parent of sorts being visited by his two kids, Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning) for a weekend. His ex-wife (Miranda Otto) and her new husband are going to visit her parents in Boston. When the power goes out and nothing electrical will work (a man can somehow use his video camera to shoot the aliens right before he meets a rather gruesome end). Ray sets out with his kids in the only working car (seemingly in the world) to Boston to find his ex-wife. They meet Oglivy (Tim Robbins) who is a survivalist/conspirator and hide in his basement for an extended sequence.""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" IS A GOOD MOVIE, NOT A GREAT ONE, BUT HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM A TERRIBLE ONE, OR EVEN A MEDIOCRE ONE.The movie makes a mistake in taking too many things from other movies and combining them into one. An alien scans for people using a large camera like thing to scan their eyes so people must stand perfectly still like in ""Minority Report"". If anyone has seen the movie ""Evolution"" the way one alien dies will be no suprise to you. And the end just tries too hard to tie things upin a tight, albeit improbable, knot. The end is just rightly wrong and very upbeat, and I would have liked it much better if it ended grimmer and with a certain character actually being dead. ""War Of The Worlds"" is a good movie, not a great one, but hundreds of miles away from a terrible one, or even a mediocre one. ""War Of The Worlds"" is stylish and very entertaining, but running at a rather thing two hours, the movie could have affored to develop the characters just a little bit more. This movie is as entertaining as possible, but it just leaves many gaps unfilled. Bring on the sequel.

The original sci-fi  adaptation resonated during the Cold War period and it comes renewed with urgency in this post-millenial age of terrorism and aggravating natural disasters. With David Koepp's crisp script and focused storytelling, Spielberg does justice to Well's book especially in the creation of the malevolent tripod aliens. Tom Cruise holds himself well as a father guilty of negligence while Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins give memorable performances especially in the scene where they seek refuge in a dark house. Spielberg uses the CGI judiciously and juxtaposes the small moments of suspense against the jaw-dropping set of overturned ships, crushed towns and crumbling buildings. With a gloss of nostalgia through the use of Well's introduction and epilogue and infusing the story with sentimental humanity, Spielberg gives us a pulsating movie that balances CGI wizardry with lots of heart.

For example after the ferry attack when the monsters are zapping people on the hills. Thirty seconds straight out of a Pieter Brueghel the Elder painting. Hellish images... the stuff of bad nightmares. Truely frightening. Scarier than any other 'alien' carnage I've ever seen. There's about 1/2 hour of this kind of stuff that makes it a worth while viewing.Unfortunately he has these actors, sigh, he has to throw in some ""relevant"" stuff that comments on the times.  These actors just have to have their high school drama class theatrics so they can feel important, I guess. Alienated youth. Unreasonable wife (how new is that?). Cute kid. Sheech. Clich?s abound. The only thing not there is the puppy. Speilburg thinks these people are ""every day people"" and they are in his neighborhood of hollywood types. They would just be irratating petulant dopes in any other neighborhood.There are NO people this dumb. They stand there and gaze in awe at the monsters they KNOW are going to zap them. Not credible.  Not even close. RUN YOU FOOLS! Bumbling fools blundering into danger that 99% of real people would be smart enough to avoid. Inane mob scenes that make no sense. Not to mention several lapses in logic, such as the video camera that works when EVERY OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICE DOESN'T or the car that 'just' needs a solenoid. Nope!None of the actor stuff is interesting. ZERO. Of course the images and special effects are wonderous. That's why you go see the film. Fire the actors, put in auto wreck dummies and you'd have nearly the same movie.Spielberg makes future kitsch when tries to get serious. SURPRISE! it has a happy ending! For no apparent reason! Incredibly Tom is reunited with his son who miraculously was not zapped with the soldiers despite the gigantic explosions and being just under the monsters. (Heck I would have fed that kid to the monsters if he was mine.) No explanation, the kid just shows up! OH come on! Classic Spielberg, always a happy ending even when the world is nearly ended and millions are turned into ashes.It's just too bad. He could have made a movie as great as a Brueghel painting.

Because i've seen a lot of reviews dating all the way back from late SEPTEMBER stating that they rented the film, give me a break, no they didn't, the movie was barely released in Japan on November 14th or around there and that was the first location of official release. Then I see immature little five year olds or people who act that age posting stupid things that I won't get into...but you want to know whats even more sad? I see horrible reviews that are totally un-elaborate getting ""20 out of 30 people found this review helpful"" even though all they say are ""This movie sucks, watch something else, this is the worst movie i've ever seen!"" but then I see these very descriptive, in-depth reviews getting ""7 out of 19 people found this review helpful"", its obvious that the bashers are doing that on purpose, whats the point of this rant? The bad reviews, most of them at least, don't mean squat and you shouldn't even bother reading them...Now, to the movie....This movie was something else, I walked in to the movie theater on June 29th expecting a good action movie directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, Steven Spielberg who directed well known films such as Jaws and Jurassic Park, and I thought that War Of The Worlds would be something great but not something this special and breathtaking.The movie basically starts out with a man, Ray Ferrier (played by Tom Cruise who gives one of his best performances to date) who isn't exactly a good father, he arrives a half an hour late to his house in which he was supposed to meet with his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto whose only in the film for a short amount of time but gives her role justice)whose pregant and is raising her two children, Rachel (Dakota Fanning who does a incredible job, oscar worthy) and Robby (Justin Chatwin whose presence is full of light on screen) alone with her new husband, Tim. Ray is still much like a kid himself and clearly doesn't know the part of being a father, he likes to consider himself a bachelor so it seems. The beginning is very good in setting this up in such a short amount of time and adds a lot of humore which gets you ready for the incredible action thats set to start soon.Soon after the mom drops her kids off, her and Tim head off to Boston to visit her grandmother leaving Ray alone with his two kids, very awkard situation, but this situation is lifted off the ground when lightening suddenly strikes the town hitting in only one spot. Soon, all the cars and anything that has to do with electricity shut off and nothing works. Ray decides to head off to where the lightening striked and investigate, soon after, a alien Tripod lifts from the ground and begins torching people out of there clothes, from then on, the action never stops and just lifts you off the ground.This isn't your average action film, unlike other disaster films such as Independance Day or The Day After Tomorrow, you never see major landmarks being destroyed but only hear about them from other people who have heard stories. A great addition is that Spielberg keeps the camera on only our three main charectors, he never for a second shows anything that Ray, Rachel or Robby are not seeing. Everything they see is whats on film. Its really great and makes the movie seem even more realistic.The digital effects, and CGI are astonishing, you never for once think that whats happening on screen is fake or cheesy, its all real and some of the best images I have EVER seen put on screen, its just as realistic as Jurassic Park, except that movie used dinosaurs and this movie used Tripods and had massive destruction but you get my point.Now the acting, the actors are all excellent, all deserve at least some form of movie nominations for there great acting, Dakota was the one who stood out most, even adding more presence and sometimes even out-acting Tom Cruise. She deserves a oscar nomination. Tom Cruise gave one of his best performances to date and also deserves a nomination of some sort, maybe even a win. Justin Chatwin did great while acting alongside Cruise and Fanning, all the actors gave there best and it shows. There so realistic in both the humorous, dangerous and just extremely dramatic situations.Overall: Get this DVD, the special features are great and you actually get a VERY good insight on the filming process, its like your there filming the movie with them, and you see a ton of behind the scenes and the actors/crew on location, you get a lot of interviews with the stars and Steven Spielberg, lots of mentions on the original WOTW, just try it out and see if you like the film for yourself instead of listening to these bad reviews that are probably written by 7-10 year olds. I realize that most of these immature bashers will say my review wasn't helpful to them, but i'm not writing this review for them, i'm writing this review for the mature people who are out to find a good movie and need a good description of it to help them make there final decision.

This 2005 version is gripping in a number of ways but shows the human side of the attack rather than so much special effects stuff that the story becomes boring. Tom Cruise does a great job of portraying a detatched father that fights to both save his children and to gain their trust and love. Dakota Fanning does an especially good job in the portrayal of a daughter who is much less than trustworthy. There is way more than enough to convince the viewer that human kind is getting it's tail kicked by a mass of tripods and some ugly aliens.

635094,A3DIKJP95XTKX0,B00005JNTI,"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley""","[2, 3]","I had very high expectations for this film. War Of the Worlds is one of my favourite novels and I was looking forward to what a director of Stephen Spielberg's calibre, a professed lover of the book would do with this his film version.Sadly I was disappointed, film makers have yet to achieve a definitive film of this book and while Spielberg's film has its plusses, the negatives bring it down to an ok at best.On the plus side, Spielberg's depiction of the tripods is superb, they could almost have stepped out of the book itself. The way they look, the way that they move and the sounds that they emit are as near to Well's vision as you could possibly want.Dakota Fanning gives a very strong performance as his daughter, and is clearly a young actress with a very big future ahead of her.Another of Well's visions that is well realised in the film is the ghastly red weed of the invaders and its awful source....The scene in the cellar where Tom Cruise, his daughter and Tim Robbin's survivalist have the encounter with the telescopic eye is great but is more of a nod to George Pal's earlier version than the book itself.Spielberg is a master of crowd scenes and he puts this talent to good use in War Of the Worlds, as thousands of refugees flee the invaders in chaotic and spectacular style.Dakota Fanning gives a very strong performance as his daughter, and is clearly a young actress with a very big future ahead of her.Having acknowledged the film's strengths, lets now examine its weaknesses:Unfortunately Spielberg falls into the same trap as George Pal in his earlier version and makes the tripods invulnerable to the weaponry of mankind. This is not the case in the book where despite the technology gulf, the tripods could still be destroyed by cannon and shell fire. By following the same route as George Pal, Spielberg misses what the book does so well and that is to give the reader/viewer some (false) hope that humanity will be able to overcome the invaders. This would have been a superb false dawn for any film maker to have been able to have put across to an audience, using todays SFX. Could you imagine an audience watching on the big screen, the heroic but ultimately doomed stand by the battleship Thunderchild against a group of tripods? Like readers of the book, the audience would have been taken to the highs of the battle when the ship destroys several tripods, all the time being cheered on by crowds of people on the banks and on other ships fleeing the scene. Then to the lows when the ship gets blasted by the heat rays of the other tripods. This is an opportunity sadly missed by all film versions of the book to date.Tom Cruise is forgettable as the hero and if anything his performance is slightly grating.The film's fatal flaw though is the ending which is rushed and weak. It is almost as though Spielberg could not wait to conclude the film any which way he can.... And it shows. When I saw the film in the cinema, many of the audience did not understand the ending and it was a discussion point on exiting the cinema. Obviously they had not read the book but as a film maker Spielberg dropped a real clangar there. I hope that any future Director's Cut of this film in the future will see a re-shot and more complete ending. It badly needs it.On a technical note, the DTS soundtrack of the dvd is VERY LOUD indeed, and I had to lower the volume of my home cinema system to well below its normal settings so as to avoid damage to my ears. Superb sound nonetheless though and definitely a dvd to use to test out just how good your speakers actually are.To conclude, will a film maker somewhere make a film version of War Of The Worlds that is faithful to the book, please. The technology exists, this most recent version proves that! Just apply it to a faithful recreation of the book and the film maker doing this will have a mega hit, both commercially and critically on his hands.

Wells radio show of the 1940s is a really awesome movie and while I was not immediately receptive of this before seeing it with a friend, I was immediately enjoying it as it progressed. The older version from 1953 I thought was not great at all and was a complete truckload of cheese even by '50s standards.But not this newer version. Directed by legendary producer and director Steven Spielbert, ""War Of The Worlds"" is an awesome movie. Set in New York City, an estranged father Ray (Tom Cruise) is setting an awful example to his teenage son and young daughter (Dakota Fanning) but then a very odd electrical phenomenon happens that causes all of the city's electrical infrastructure to fail leaving the city completely without power. It gets worse when mysterious pods instantly start to blast out from under the streets and unleash havoc on the city, vaporizing the city's residents. The electrical phenomenon spreads out to the countryside and chaos erupts. Now Ray must do whatever he can to ensure the safety of his estranged children and get them out of harms way by the alien spaceships that are hell-bent on destroying humanity.Contrary to his recent behavior off-screen (Katie Holmes?, give me a break!) Tom Cruise is excelletn playing the off-beat deadbeat dad that is forced to reevaluation his attitude towards his kids as he gets them to safety and figures out how to repel the alien forces off the planet.This movie does in fact have a lot of similarities to the 1996 classic ""Independence Day"". Both involve predatory alien lifeforms that ""Do Not Come In Peace"". Both involve humanity waging war against an unforseen non-human enemy.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[7, 10]","It was 103 degrees in the shade when I fled to the dark, cool sanctuary of the theater to watch Steven Spielberg's latest effort.  WAR OF THE WORLDS delivers visual magnificence in spades, as deadbeat dad Tom Cruise and his two estranged kids flee savage aliens--creatures who very much wish to wipe out the human race and claim Earth for themselves.  Yet despite the turmoil and never-ending conflict and terror, this is a story about a father reconnecting with his two children on a deeply personal and emotional level.This movie hits the ground running; shortly after Cruise's children are delivered to his rundown home for the weekend, the alien attack commences and the roller coaster ride begins.  The action, the effects, the way stuff gets destroyed and torn up, the sets, etc., are incredible, and very ""Spielberg-esque.""  But despite the visual feast, the movie presented several problems I found hard to digest.  Huge tripod machines buried under the earth for millions of years that we silly humans never discovered?  And what was the purpose of the wacky Tim Robbins character, who added absolutely nothing to the story?  And memo to humans:  When fleeing demonic alien forces, don't go run onto a ferry, where you become a sitting duck on the water.  Finally, the ending was a disappointing whimper, and (Spoiler!) the ultimate demise of the aliens totally inconsistent with an extra-terrestrial species so far advanced they surely would have planned in advance to immune themselves to Earth's bacteria.Despite my misgivings, WAR OF THE WORLDS is still great fun, and (additional heads up to parents of small children) very intense.  Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin turn in fine performances as Cruise's kids, while Miranda Otto (forever known to me as Eowyn from ""Lord of the Rings"") has a small role as the ex-wife.  And Spielberg's breath-taking visuals are further enhanced by composer John Williams' haunting score. This movie is a great way to beat some of that summertime heat.--D.

The end of the world cometh with fire and fury; scary technology, creepy monsters from another world. A dysfunctional family flees electrical storms, giant -- really giant -- sinister tripods, sizzling vaporizations, thunderous explosions (best workout for a home theater sound system that I've heard to date!)... There are well imagined scenes of desperation, heroics and helplessness as humanity faces a race of beings with superior technology and bad intent.Yet, Science Fiction is NOT the same as Fictional Science (also known as Science Fantasy). Steven Spielberg has inexplicably taken a very good Science Fiction novel and converted it into a Science Fantasy movie. As such, I can't really endorse this modernized version. While the opening and closing moments of the movie clearly follows HG Well's WotW Science Fiction, everything in-between veers solidly into fantasy land (electronics working when they shouldn't, camera capturing aliens ""riding the lightning"", the stabbing machine, airliners flying well after the start of the attack...). Those that don't care about this distinction will probably enjoy the movie without such reservations. For me, the fantasy grates against the original book's faithfulness within the rules of Science Fiction (taking known science, and writing human fiction around it). Spielberg didn't even bother to change the one major element of science that has changed since the book was written -- surely the aliens would have, in their meticulous invasion plan, done some serious homework on the microbe life on earth... no?2 1/2 stars for the action and vibrant pacing + another 1/2 star for the amazing soundtrack.",3,"Great Action, Science Fantasy",1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,1835,"['unique', 'mankind', 'end-of-the-world', 'story', 'adapted', 'middling', 'results', 'early', '1900', 'HG', 'Wells', 'novel', 'WotW', 'spectacular', 'thrills', 'chills', 'ride', 'end', 'world', 'cometh', 'fire', 'fury', 'scary', 'technology', 'creepy', 'monsters', 'world', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'flees', 'electrical', 'storms', 'giant', 'really', 'giant', 'sinister', 'tripods', 'sizzling', 'vaporizations', 'thunderous', 'explosions', 'best', 'workout', 'home', 'theater', 'sound', 'system', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'date', 'are', 'well', 'imagined', 'scenes', 'desperation', 'heroics', 'helplessness', 'humanity', 'race', 'beings', 'superior', 'technology', 'bad', 'intent.Yet', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'NOT', 'same', 'Fictional', 'Science', 'also', 'known', 'Science', 'Fantasy', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'inexplicably', 'taken', 'very', 'good', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'novel', 'converted', 'Science', 'Fantasy', 'movie', 'such', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'endorse', 'modernized', 'version', 'opening', 'closing', 'moments', 'movie', 'clearly', 'HG', 'Well', 'WotW', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'everything', 'in-between', 'veers', 'solidly', 'fantasy', 'land', 'electronics', 'working', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'camera', 'capturing', 'aliens', 'riding', 'lightning', 'stabbing', 'machine', 'airliners', 'flying', 'well', 'start', 'attack', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'distinction', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'such', 'reservations', 'fantasy', 'original', 'book', 'faithfulness', 'rules', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'taking', 'known', 'science', 'writing', 'human', 'fiction', 'Spielberg', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'change', 'one', 'major', 'element', 'science', 'changed', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'surely', 'aliens', 'would', 'have', 'meticulous', 'invasion', 'plan', 'done', 'serious', 'homework', 'microbe', 'life', 'earth', '2', '1/2', 'stars', 'action', 'vibrant', 'pacing', '+', '1/2', 'star', 'amazing', 'soundtrack']",N/A
635103,AH8JZMWED0LBV,B00005JNTI,Drew,"[7, 9]","""War of the Worlds,"" the latest adaptation of H.G. Wells' 1898 novel (minus the introductory article ""The"" in the original title), is another in the increasinly tall pile of newer movies that are visually excellent but bereft of a corresponding emotional strength to give those visuals true meaning. Spielberg's latest generation-defining-epic-that-almost-was-but-then-wasn't seems to be a two-hour series of random, violent deaths punctuated by unconvincing asides where the director attempts to show us the dysfunctional nature of mankind's value systems, usually through the interactions of the main characters (an East-coast family separated by divorce) with each other and a small number of other characters of varying degrees of inconsequence. Spielberg's techniques will probably work for some people (the same sort who took ""Independence Day, ""Armageddon,"" and other such films at face value and never questioned those movies' inherent absurdity) but for people who are more cynical this new ""War of the Worlds"" movie is a relative letdown. The entire premise for the aliens' attack seems a bit questionable, the premise for their defeat also questionable, and many other questions an intelligent audience may have aren't answered but are instead answered with more explosions, deaths, and rather  shameless attempts at manipulating the audience's emotions. Added to this, for some reason Spielberg finds it necessary to include awkward references to current politics and post ""9/11"" terrorist paranoia, which, far from making the audience think ""wow! just like in real life!"" instead will make a lot of people roll their eyes and look at their indiglo watch in the theatre to see what time it is and whether or not it might actually be a better idea to movie-hop and catch the 9:45 showing of that new Batman movie.*spoiler warning*Ray (Tom Cruise's character) is a New Jersey dockworker who has two children, a seventeen year old son (Justing Chatwick, in a sullen performance which is probably the best in the movie), and ten year old daughter (Dakota Fanning, doing what she does best in movies -- screaming in terror over and over, usually louder each time). He is divorced from his wife, and she is pregnant from her new boyfriend. She is visiting her parents (who live in Boston) for a weekend with her new beau, and is leaving the kids with Ray. Spielberg is effective here in confusing the audience in a good way -- people are tempted to dislike Cruise's ex-wife because she seems condescending, and her new boyfriend acts so 'rich-boy' self important (he has a beautiful new luxury SUV parked in front of Ray's blue-collar neighborhood) that the audience may wish that Ray would punch him out then and there. The audience is also tempted to dislike Ray's kids, who seem a bit spoiled and aloof toward their father. However, Cruise's character proves just as unlikable because he acts like a jerk toward his kids and seems kind of like an immature middle-aged guy who still acts like a child (he is playing with a dismantled car engine in his kitchen with the same enthusiasm that a little boy plays with a Tonka truck in the house). The audience is thus made aware of the dysfunctional nature of the family on screen, and it is obviously intended that the audience recognize some of their own families' petty squabbles vicariously. It is clear that Spielberg wants the audience to realise the skewed nature of our emotional priorities in the face of the entire world collapsing, which, naturally, is just what occurs.Odd thunderstorms around the world (of which we are informed on the TV screens in Ray's home) and which later occur in the sky above Ray's home soon indicate that all is not well. A particularly deep crater in the middle of the neighborhood draws the interest of most of the inhabitants, and suddenly a gigantic, 100-foot tall alien craft emerges, supported by three slinky-like spider legs. The craft appears somewhat similar to the Imperial Walkers that characterized ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (in fact, the models for both movies were designed by the same man) and just as impractical. Some in the audience may wonder why no one in the movie ever tried to trip the machines somehow. The alien craft appear to have different methods for killing humans and different reasons for doing so. At their first appearance, the craft shoot humans randomly with laser beams that vaporize them. Okay, the audience thinks, the aliens just want to kill the humans.Cruise survives going downtown to look at the crater where the initial machine materialized and rushes back home to collect his children, with the plan to leave New Jersey and race to Boston, with the ultimate goal of reuniting with his ex-wife. What purpose this would serve other than allowing them all to die together, I don't know. It seems that the alien craft (as destructive as the first one was, it's only one among many that attack this city and others all over the world) have been able to render all cars unusable with some kind of energy field, except one, which Ray miraculously able to use.The movie then degenerates into various scenes of Ray's family avoiding death at every turn while literally hundreds of other thinking, sentient humans around them provide background gore. Extraneous characters include a mysterious woman and her daughter who apparently know Ray, and run into him by coincidence on a road crowded with faceless refugees. This, after Ray and company are predictably releived of their car by an insane crowd. Just as quickly as we are introduced to her, she disappears and we are led to believe she must have been killed by the latest alien ""phaser attack.""Eventually, in what is meant to be a pivotal scene, Tim Robbins appears as an insane gun-toter who somehow selects Ray and his daughter out of a fleeing crowd of thousands to share room in his basement. Robbins' character is obsessed with resisting the occupier, though by what means is not made clear. In fact, this whole sequence, which lasts over 30 minutes, is rather confusing. At first we are led to believe Robbins' will join forces with Ray to fight the aliens, but then he degenerates into insanity, making a lot of uncomfortable and inappropriate (though never candid) references to the current political situation in Iraq, and the scene is ultimately disappointing. Oh yeah, and Tom Cruise kills him with a two-by-four.It seems that Spielberg is confused or at least unclear in what he wants this movie to be. The aliens seem to serve no purpose other than to inform us that ""yes, you humans are insignificant and all your fancy weapons and society and civilization are useless in the face of a power you cannot understand."" At other points he seems to want the aliens to be there just so that Ray's character can learn his lesson and become a better father at the expense of the lives of millions of extras from the screen actors' guild. If Spielberg's theme is just that humanity (or at least Americans) need a wake up call, then I can buy that, but his execution is sloppy.At first, the aliens seem to just want to kill humans, later it seems they want to eat us, later still, it seems they want to use us as fertilizer. It's confusing, and for audience members who know they're not inherently dumb, the fault of the confusion is just incoherent story telling. If you have to think about a movie afterward to have it make better sense in your mind, then that's a good movie. If you have to think about a movie later to have it make ANY sense, then it can't be a good movie. Robbins' character, before his bloody demise, informs us that the aliens planted their ""tripod"" attack craft millions of years ago in planning this attack, and that the alien drivers ""came down in the lightning storm"" to pilot the hidden craft. This leads to some odd questions. First, if the aliens were here millions of years ago, why didn't they just take over the planet then? This might make sense if the aliens need us somehow (like for food or fertilizer) but it makes less sense in the way the aliens vaporize people with no way to resist rather than eating them or turning them into fertilizer. Also, if they planted these craft several millions of years ago it might be interesting to see some of the craft emerge from under the oceans, which have changed position over many millions of years. It seems a bit convenient that the craft all appear in only the places that offer the best chance for blowing things up.Finally, this movie lacks a satisfying high-point. It just ends abruptly, with Morgan Freeman narrating ""oh yeah, they caught a virus, or something"" which is just how the book ended, but the book ended in a satisfying way relative to the rest of the book, where as Spielberg's movie just falls flat on its face.This is an okay movie, but certainly not worth a second viewing. I doubt if it will make huge money at the box office.",3,"Excellent in some ways, magnificently BAd in others",1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,8921,"['War', 'Worlds', 'latest', 'adaptation', 'H.G',

635104,A3RTWB96Z6S2RU,B00005JNTI,Drew Patowsky,"[2, 3]","To be honest i laughed the whole way through this movie, which is a good thing. If i'm laughing i'm enjoying myself and that's exactly what you're supposed to do when seeing a summer box office movie. Now before i rave about the movie i'd like to take on the point many have made that this movie was pointless and it shouldn't have revolved around one man's family but the whole world like the title suggests. Frankly if this movie left tom cruise and his family i would've walked out I don't know about you but ID4 seemed like the least likely thing to happen during an alien invasion (the ending not the detruction so much.)The great thing about staying with this one man (Ray) is that we're kept in the dark about the alien invasion as he is. For instance in the one scene where everybody is walking to the ferry and you hear somebody say ""Europe hasn't been touched!"" and then another man says ""I heard Europe was totally destroyed"" it really creates this contrast that NO BODY knows anything! We focus on Ray cause essentially we're supposed to be him! Everything we learn about these aliens Ray has learned a split second before us and that to me was important cause if we knew what their weakness was before Ray did than the movie itself would be pointless. I felt i invested so much in Tom Cruise as Ray that the only reason i was mad at the end of the movie was because it was over! I wanted/needed more!Then some say ""and that Dakota Fanning! all she does is scream and smart off to her dad!"" Well if you don't scream when aliens destroy the earth more power to ya, and i think it was important to show that she loved her brother more than her father cause that added on to the father's struggle and made him fight harder when you get right down to it. Frankly I think if Dakota Fanning wasn't in this movie than the movie wouldn't nearly be as powerful and the charecter of the daughter would be one that we could all live without.Like i said i laughed, enjoyed, and savored each scene of this film. ""Lightning doesn't stirke twice"" Ray says to his scared daughter than lighting stikes in the same place seven or eight more times. In the theatre i was in you could hear the people gasp and laugh and most of all the one lady in the back yelling ""AAHH!"" Which was all good fun.

Wells story had its greatest impact in 1938 when, under the general command of  the very young Orson Welles, the supervision of Houseman, and the direction of Paul Stewart, with John Garfield in a small part and the Mercury  Players performing, a radio program drew nationwide attention with its Halloween presentation. Hadley Cantril, then associated with a research group in Princeton, NJ, did the standard contemporary study of why some people credited the cautionary fictional tale with being real.Spielberg follows an earlier film version with a good technical feat of creating crashing buildings and general chaos following the invasion by alien monster machines. Unfortunately, these films must also have a human cast. Spielberg gets a good job from Tom Cruise, as a working class father, who has been given care of their two children by his ex-wife, while she and her current husband are going out of town (to Boston from NYC) for the week-end. Their adventures, in trying to escape the monsters and the mobs of frightened people, is a reasonable accompaniment to the technical aspects of the picture.My only real complaint is that Spielberg still has the monsters walking on three long, spidery metal legs; very awkward for an advanced civilization.This may not be the final word on  alien attacks, but it is a pretty entertaining one.",4,Spielberg  Does A Good Job With An Old Favorite,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,1364,"['course', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'story', 'had', 'greatest', 'impact', '1938', 'when', 'general', 'command', 'very', 'young', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'supervision', 'Houseman', 'direction', 'Paul', 'Stewart', 'John', 'Garfield', 'small', 'part', 'Mercury', 'Players', 'performing', 'radio', 'program', 'drew', 'nationwide', 'attention', 'Halloween', 'presentation', 'Hadley', 'Cantril', 'then', 'associated', 'research', 'group', 'Princeton', 'NJ', 'did', 'standard', 'contemporary', 'study', 'why', 'people', 'credited', 'cautionary', 'fictional', 'tale', 'being', 'real.Spielberg', 'earlier', 'film', 'version', 'good', 'technical', 'feat', 'creating', 'crashing', 'buildings', 'general', 'chaos', 'following', 'invasion', 'alien', 'monster', 'machines', 'Unfortunately', 'films', 'must', 'also', 'have', 'human', 'cast', 'Spielberg', 'good', 'job', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'working', 'class', 'father', 'who', 'been', 'given', 'care', 'two', 'children', 'ex-wife', 'current', 'husband', 'are', 'going', 'town', 'Boston', 'NYC', 'week-end', 'adventures', 'trying', 'escape', 'monsters', 'mobs', 'frightened', 'people', 'reasonable', 'accompaniment', 'technical', 'aspects', 'picture.My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'Spielberg', 'still', 'monsters', 'walking', 'three', 'long', 'spidery', 'metal', 'legs', 'very', 'awkward', 'advanced', 'civilization.This', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'final', 'word', 'alien', 'attacks', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'one']",N/A

This time, aliens from somewhere further away than ""Europe"" have declared war on Planet Earth, and everything is falling apart, including the bodies and spirits of people: faster than anyone can imagine.A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FOR A SIMILAR H.G. WELLS ADAPTATION AS FILMED IN 1953Ray Ferrier [Tom Cruise] plays the everyman type who is forced, out of necessity, to protect his two children against monstrous alien invaders. Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator on the New Jersey docks, and lives nearby. Ferrier is divorced from his wife Mary Ann [Miranda Otto] and has a poor relationship with his two children Rachel and Robbie [Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin]. He sees them during weekend visitations.During one such visitation, he and the kids see a series of strange and violent lighting storms hit the neighborhood. During a brief absence from home, Ray witnessed a fleet of laser-ray tripod spaceships emerging nearby. Fleeing from the scene, literally everything behind Ray was disintegrated as the first wave of the alien invasion began.When he returned home, the film and Ray both shifted gears into turbo-overdrive as Ray desperately attempted to get his kids out-of-Dodge by any means, and to safety. But was there any safety left for him?Ray's desperate task was embodied as the excursion he took his two children on to find safety and their mother. In this film, Ray's epiphany came in the form of becoming the man and father he never was while he was married to his children's mother.Also of interest, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, the leads from the 1953 version of this film, are Ray Ferrier ex in-laws, who are finally seen at the end of the film.*-- PRINCIPAL ACTORS -- *Tom Cruise - Ray FerrierDakota Fanning - Rachel FerrierMiranda Otto - Mary AnnJustin Chatwin - Robbie FerrierTim Robbins - OgilvyRick Gonzalez - VincentYul Vazquez - JulioLenny Venito - Manny the MechanicLisa Ann Walter - BartenderAnn Robinson - GrandmotherGene Barry - GrandfatherMorgan Freeman - Narrator [Voice]ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN VIDEO & AUDIO BUT LIMITED FEATURESThis DVD played and sounded flawless. However, all it had for features, was a brief but interesting featurette about making the monsters for the film. It delved into the idea of turning the story on its head and have the aliens come out of the ground. I wish there was more, alot more.BOTTOM LINE: MORE THAN JUST EYE-CANDY BUT LESS THAN AN EPIC CLASSICTerrific effects, excellent story, but alas, the pacing was just to out-of-this-world fast to allow me time to give a darn about the outcome and what it was I was seeing. Giving the viewpoint of the film to an everyman divorced father with kids, and a mission, was a novel way to play out this material and it was at times quite excellent. Nevertheless, although the film was much more than eye-candy it weighed in as somewhat short of an epic classic.

635108,A9CKMSQ6ZEWLB,B00005JNTI,D. Rodgers,"[0, 0]","H.G. Wells' famous novel, The War of the Worlds, has been done many times before; once as a radio broadcast by Orson Welles (which caused mass panic and hysteria back in the late 30's), a movie in the 50's, a TV series in the late 80's, an e-comic (or online comic) from Dark Horse and even a musical in the late 70's, yes, that's right, a musical! Now it's three-time Oscar winning filmmaker Steven Spielberg's turn. Spielberg previously worked with aliens from outer space in 1977's Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 1982's E.T., and personally I think Close Encounters of the Third Kind remains to this day to be the best sci-fi film about aliens, but now Spielbergio has shed that whole ""aliens are cute"" theory and thrown it right into the shredder. In War of the Worlds the aliens are relentless killing machines, hell-bent on wiping out mankind from the face of the Earth!The film follows Ray (Tom Cruise), a full-time blue-collar dock worker and part-time dead-beat dad, whose kids are more of a weekend hassle for him than real family members. As it turns out its his turn to watch the kids (Rachel and Robbie, played well by Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) this weekend while their mother and step-father head up to Boston to visit grandpa and grandma. Everything seemed to be going just about normal for this family that is until all hell breaks loose when an alien invasion suddenly sprouts up out of the ground, literally! The aliens' tripods rise out of the ground and start blasting people left and right with laser beams causing them to burst into ashes. From this moment on the rest of the film is practically one big giant spectacle of amazing special effects, booming surround sound and total anarchy; which echoes imagery of 9/11 and the Holocaust.The film was written by David Koepp who previously worked with Spielberg on Jurassic Park. The performances are real, and pretty believable, not a single one stuck out, or bothered me at all. I can understand why Rachel would scream so much she's only ten and people are getting killed all around her! I can understand why Robbie hates his father, and wants to fight back, he's young and rebellious. And I can understand Harlan, the nut-case (played by Tim Robbins) trapped in the basement with a shotgun yearning to lead a surprise attack on the aliens. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is a little weak, at one moment it looks cold and steely and next it's gritty and a little fuzzy, but its pretty much the same old Spielberg style that he's adopted since Saving Private Ryan. And some of the tricks played in the basement seemed like they were ripped straight from the Jurassic Park screenplay, like the scene where a mirror is used to trick an alien probe, which reminded me of the kitchen scene in Jurassic Park with the Raptors. But it's still a cool scene anyhow.For many people they'll just sit down and watch War of the Worlds and look at it as just another alien invasion flick, along side other recent movies like Independence Day, Mars Attacks! or Signs, and on the surface War of the Worlds might look like just another ""survive the alien attack!"" movie, but I think its really deeper than that. Just like Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence, War of the Worlds might just have flown a little too high, over many peoples radars. As much as the film may look like a film about how we will survive an alien invasion, it's also about how will we, as humans, be able to survive ourselves, and how we'll either come together to help our survival (look at the scene where Robbie tries to help people climb onto the ferry), or how we'll end up fighting ourselves (look at the crazy mob that takes over the van at gun point). It's just as much about how they survived the aliens as how they were able to survive each other, and by setting the main characters up as a broken or ""warring"" family only helps further this theme in the plot even more. Basically Spielberg's telling us that mankind has to come together in times of need, or else we won't make it out alive.In H.G. Wells' novel it was about one man returning home to find his wife (who he thought was killed in the invasion) alive and well, even though he had already assumed and pretty much already accepted that she was already dead (without knowing for sure). Essenitally it's about keeping hope alive. This is pretty true to the book, they only changed it to Ray's son instead of his wife. Many people complain about this plot twist, saying it was unnecessary, but if you know Wells' novel it is essential. We never see Robbie killed; we simply accept it or assume it. There's time that lapses between Ray letting go of Robbie, to go reclaim Rachel from the strangers telling her its not safe for her to be alone (this is another sign of people helping people in a time of devastation; like Robbie on the Ferry), and when we see the explosion on top of the hill. Also notice a group of retreating humvees leaving the hill (some are on fire); now think about it carefully. You assume Robbie is dead or has been killed by the explosion, but you can't be sure about that, because, like Ray, you didn't see all of what happened, so it is possible that he could have escaped the alien attack just in time... it is possible. Sure its an assumption, but its not any more right or wrong than assuming that he's already dead. It would also explain how Robbie got to Boston before Ray (who was shelled up in the basement for a few days with Harlan). Think about it.Another thing people seem to gripe about War of the Worlds is how the aliens died; through bacteria. People ask ""What the aliens didn't take their flu shots before they left for Earth?"" Well how would they have known about the Earth's bacteria? The tripods were buried long ago, but the aliens only came down in the lightning. In the opening narration we are told that the Martians studied us through their telescopes with envious eyes, much like we study single cell organisms through a microscope... and it is eventually our microscopic bacteria that brings them to their demise. The movie touches on this when Rachel shows her dad a splinter stuck in her hand in the beginning (which he can't see until closer examination), and they talk about infections, and how her body will just naturally push the splinter out when its ready. Just like how the aliens will, naturally, be killed off because of the bacteria. The aliens were probably just not aware of the bacteria, and that mistake; that they underestimated the Earth, was their single mistake that cost them the entire war, even though they were easily winning the battle, all because they didn't look close enough.The original 1952 War of the Worlds film was an analogy for nuclear war and a possible Russian invasion, because they were considered to be ""the huge threat"" at that time, and in Spielberg's film the alien invasion is an analogy for terrorism in a post-9/11 world. There are tons of references to this through out the film; the posting of pictures of family member that are missing as a way of searching to find one another, ""Is it the terrorists?"" Rachel and Robbie both ask Ray when their neighborhood is being obliterated, a smoldering plane wreck reminded me of United Flight 93. And if you watch the scene where Robbie supposedly dies on the hill from the big explosion, look carefully at the left side of the screen during this scene and you can see an image of one of the Twin Towers, I'm not joking, it's really there (exactly 70 minutes into the film), look carefully. And then of course there's the reference that Harlan makes about how ""occupations never last"", which is clearly a reference to the Iraq War. Notice how Ray and his family are always running away from the aliens and it's not until he stands up and tries to fight back (the scene with the grenade in ""the basket"") that the aliens start to die off. Could this too be a message about standing up to our fears, and tormentors? I don't know for sure, maybe, maybe not. I've seen the film many times and I still don't think I've caught all the references, but every time I sit down and watch this film and think about it a little more, the more I notice things in it, whether done intentionally or not I don't know, but one thing I know for sure is that Spielberg isn't an idiot just trying to blow stuff up (cough Roland Emmerich!). This is basically Spielberg doing Independence Day, but not just destroying cities and blowing people up just for the sake of another big and loud summer blockbuster, but to also allow us to think a little bit; its summer popcorn fun that's not dumbed down, and while it still excites our eyes and ears it can also allow us to think for ourselves, and it doesn't necessarily forcefully spoon-feed us everything down our throats. Simply put; different people see different things, and it's up to the individual to determine what it is that they really see in War of the Worlds, beyond the computer effects, which to some might have paralyzed their brains while dazzling their eyes so much.

Oddly, many of the events surrounding the central theme of alien invasion take a back seat to the broken family's constant bickering. Even the plot device that ultimately drives the invading forces from the planet's surface is left to a tacked-on bit of Morgan Freeman narration to explain, which gives the impression that it's more important to see three random individuals arrive safely in Boston than it is to ensure the survival of the human race at large. Or perhaps the filmmakers just assumed that everyone was already familiar with the developments in the original tale and chose not to overdo it with a straightforward rehash. Either way, the tighter focus actually manages to deliver a greater perspective of the day's events and allows for a quieter, more suspenseful overall vibe, but misses badly at conveying any sense of a greater arching plot structure. With the benefit of hindsight, many of the film's special effects don't look particularly good, but an impressive display of sound design goes a long way toward redeeming those failings.

635114,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B00005JNTI,dv_forever,"[4, 10]","In the realm of big Hollywood filmmaking, a few names instantly rise to the top of the mountain of action/adventure extravaganzas and general popcorn munching enthusiasm. These few men are the best of the best in making big entertainment, they are Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Peter Jackson and their inferiors are George Lucas, Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich and many more.  Lucas, a friend of Speilberg, is one of the most derided directors around because of his prequel 'Star Wars' trilogy. Those prequels, although saturated with CGI, aren't that bad but they failed to live up to most expectations.  Michael Bay is an MTV style, action exploitation director, probably the worst big budget filmmaker of his generation. ( Case in point, Armageddon ).  Roland Emmerich made 'Independence Day', a fun popcorn film and three laughable travesties, 'Godzilla', 'The Patriot' and 'The Day After Tomorrow'.  Peter Jackson is one of the most over the top, bloated, CGI happy filmmakers of them all.  Watch the silly 'King Kong' and be introduced to videogame cinema.So that leaves us with the two true superstars.  James Cameron and Steven Spielberg.  Cameron is a very intelligent filmmaker, using special effects for the sole purpose of telling a good story.  His films like 'Aliens' and the first '2 Terminators' are a lot more dangerous and very much anti-establishment than anything Spielberg has ever done.  Cameron also made a 'Gone with the Wind' for this generation in the much praised and much hated 'Titanic'.  That was 8 years ago and Cameron doesn't work as fast as some other directors.  Cameron's next Hollywood movie will be out in 2007, a sci-fi work based on a Japenese comic book.Spielberg then remains the true director of the Hollywood machine, churning out entertainment after entertainment in the seventies, eighties, nineties and today.  Steven's greatest work, the only film you can actually sense is striving towards art is obviously Schindler's List.  It's far superior to everything else Spielberg has ever done, even if it doesn't approach true cinema greatness like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Tokyo Story, Godfather Part 2.After Schindler's list, Spielberg has made one error after another, a long string of idiotic movies, all expertly crafted.The silly sequel to Jurassic Park, 'The Lost World'.  The dull drama 'Amistad', which everyone has trashed, a Hollywood billionaire tackling slavery is not conducive to the making of a great film.  Then the patriotic, flag waiving, cliche of a war movie, 'Saving Private Ryan', a film with two extradionary action scenes and a healthy dose of jingoism and sentimentality. How about 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence', a potentially deep exploration of what makes us human, a film that succeeds on many levels until the inevitable, sappy, Spielberg schmaltz takes over at the end?  'Minority Report', another fascinating science-fiction film with a terrible, ribben bow, happy ending. 'Catch Me If You Can' was fun breezy, entertainment.  'The Terminal' is one of the most half-brained pieces of garbage I've seen in quite some time.Every time Spielberg makes a film, I still hope he might make something great.  I must be stupid.  War of the Worlds is one of the most visceral, assaultive films to come out of Hollywood in years, how joyous it was for me to see it in the movie theater. It makes you wonder at the art of filmmaking, then reality sets in.  The film only works on the perceptive level, scaring sensitive viewers in a post 9/11 world.  Do we care or have sympathy for any of these characters?  No.  I personally wanted the aliens to win, but that's another story.  The people being incinerated, the floating bodies, humanity turning savage for the price of a working car, all this is great work.  Once Tom Cruise gets in that basement with Tim Robbins, the film is as good as dead.The acting by Cruise and Dakota Fanning is very good and John Williams' score is appropriately restrained, the special effects are quite realistic.  This is a great story, so why is Spielberg recycling Jurassic Park's Velociraptors in the basement scene with Tim Robbins?  Why do the aliens look like rejects from Independence Day?  Why does the film end so neatly?  Why does Robbie survive?  Couldn't Spielberg be more brave than that?  Why are the aliens so conveniently destroyed by microbiology? This is 2005, not H.G. Wells, circa 1895 or whenever. The characters are not developed at all, the philosophical undercurrents in the film are not explored. Since there is life outside Earth, does that give us more or less meaning as human beings?  Perhaps the aliens are just in their attempt to destroy us, the hideous predators that we humans truly are? Nothing like this is even remotely approached.It would be too easy to label this film a failure.  I think it succeeds as a sci-fi thriller, for the first 1 hour and 10 minutes, then the movie tapers off and dies a slow death.  This work does not begin to approach the level of art as some very apologetic reviewers have seen fit to define it.And it is not a dismal popcorn movie as some other critics have labeled.  It exists in that realm where many Spielberg films exist, it is good but could have been great if a braver director was at the wheel.The 2-Disc Limited Edition is ok, Spielberg never does commentaries, I applaud him for that.  Picture and sound are fine, special features are vast but superficial.  I'm a huge music fan, so I especially like John Williams discussing his approach to the scoring of the film.  The DVD is overpriced for it's contents.Movie fans everywhere hope for Spielberg to go beyond himself and actually make a great work of art.  Will that ever happen?Probably not.  His next film is Munich, perhaps he'll rise to the occasion?  Don't hold your breath.",4,"Steven Spielberg, How I Love and Loathe Thee...",1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,5805,"['realm', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'few', 'names', 'instantly', 'rise', 'top',

635115,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B00005JNTI,dylan21484nj,"[4, 4]","Steven Spielberg knows aliens. He introduced us with friendly ones with both Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T.: The Extraterrestrial. But he never tackled murderous, malicious visitors until he decided to give us a new take on H.G. Welles' War of the Worlds, one of the seminal pieces of science fiction literature, which has already seen its fair share of film treatments and is infamous for Orson Welles' radio play that caused mass panic throughout the United States eighty years ago.Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a divorced father who works at the New Jersey shipping docks. Left with his two kids (played by a petulant Justin Chatwin and a screeching Dakota Fanning) while his ex-wife spends the weekend with her new boyfriend in Boston, it's clear that there is much disfunction among them. Ray doesn't want the responsibility of looking after his children, and his kids resent him for it. But it becomes Ray's job to keep them alive when the aliens come down and start vaporizing everyone and everything.The effects are good, but in no way revolutionary. The logic of the film does seem flawed though. The aliens literally ride the lightning (is Spielberg a Metallica fan?) down to their ships buried for centuries deep beneath the Earth's soil, but why they're here is never really explained. They kill large numbers of people by literally turning them to dust with their lasers, but then begin to capture people, seemingly to drain their blood and spray the planet's surface with it, creating red vein-like vines all over everything. Why? What logical purpose does that even serve? It would be different if the aliens wanted to enslave humanity, use us as a food source, or wipe us out so they can live here and use our natural resources. Those all seem like viable reasons. But creating vines? Do they grow some kind of blood-derived hybrid alien crops they can eat?And how did their ships stay buried for so long without a single one ever being found? You'd think that we'd have come across one while digging for dinosaur fossils or something. And why arrive on a planet, bury your ships, then leave only to return thousands of years later? Were the aliens thinking, ""Okay, we won't eradicate these humans now, we'll just leave our stuff here and come back in a few millenia and do it then.""Another point of illogic is the fact that the aliens ride around in ""tripods"", giant three-legged walkers. Why three legs and not four?A table with four legs is much more stable than a table with three, so why ride around in vehicles with three legs instead of four? Their vehicles are defective by design!The finale is disappointing too. I'm aware that I might be spoiling the ending for some, but the book's been out for the better part of a century and movie's been out for the better part of a decade, so please don't complain. The aliens are ""defeated"" the same way for both. There's no big, final clash between the humans and aliens. The aliens just get sick and die. That's it. You'd  think that such technologically-advanced aliens would at least know something about virology. And I'm sorry, a big-budget sci-fi film ending with the aliens dying from the sniffles is just anti-climactic.The film is not without its good moments. The initial alien attack, the standoff between the Ferriers and an angry mob trying to steal their van, the ""river of bodies,"" and the speeding train engulfed in flames are some great moments, as is the tense scene of the Ferriers trying to hide from the aliens in a basement, though this scene goes a little too long and is very reminiscent of the basement scene in another alien movie, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs.Speaking of Signs, Spielberg seems to be trying to strike a middle ground between the intimate family story of Signs and the bombast of Independence Day, and it does feel like this movie exists somewhere between them, especially since both of those films suffered from serious story flaws too (the Signs' water-allergic aliens invading a planet made up mostly of water and the aliens from Independence Day that never heard of Norton AntiVirus).Spielberg's War of the Worlds a good alien movie, but the illogical moments and the underwhleming finale keep this movie from being great. Of all of Spielberg's alien movies, this is easily the weakest one.",3,"Spielberg can still blow stuff up, but this movie misses logic and an interesting ending",1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,4315,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'aliens', 'introduced', 'friendly', 'ones', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'E.T', 'Extraterrestrial', 'never', 'tackled', 'murderous', 'malicious', 'visitors', 'decided', 'give', 'new', 'take', 'H.G', 'Welles', 'War', 'Worlds', 'one', 'seminal', 'pieces', 'science', 'fiction', 'literature', 'already', 'seen', 'fair', 'share', 'film', 'treatments', 'infamous', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'radio', 'play', 'caused', 'mass', 'panic', 'United', 'States', 'eighty', 'years', 'ago.Tom', 'Cruise', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'divorced', 'father', 'who', 'New', 'Jersey', 'shipping', 'docks', 'Left', 'two', 'kids', 'played', 'petulant', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'screeching', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'ex-wife', 'weekend', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Boston', 'clear', 'much', 'disfunction', 'Ray', ""n't"", 'want', 'responsibility', 'looking', 'children', 'kids', 'resent', 'Ray', 'job', 'keep', 'alive', 'when', 'aliens', 'come', 'down', 'start', 'vaporizing', 'everyone', 'everything.The', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'way', 'revolutionary', 'logic', 'film', 'seem', 'flawed', 'aliens', 'literally', 'ride', 'lightning', 'Spielberg', 'Metallica', 'fan', 'ships', 'buried', 'centuries', 'deep', 'Earth', 'soil', 'why', ""'re"", 'here', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'kill', 'large', 'numbers', 'people', 'literally', 'turning', 'dust', 'lasers', 'then', 'begin', 'capture', 'people', 'seemingly', 'drain', 'blood', 'spray', 'planet', 'surface', 'creating', 'red', 'vein-like', 'vines', 'everything', 'Why', 'What', 'logical', 'purpose', 'even', 'serve', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'aliens', 'wanted', 'enslave', 'humanity', 'use', 'food', 'source', 'wipe', 'out', 'can', 'live', 'here', 'use', 'natural', 'resources', 'seem', 'viable', 'reasons', 'creating', 'vines', 'Do', 'grow', 'kind', 'blood-derived', 'hybrid', 'alien', 'crops', 'can', 'eat', 'how', 'did', 'ships', 'stay', 'buried', 'so', 'long', 'single', 'one', 'ever', 'being', 'found', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'come', 'one', 'while', 'digging', 'dinosaur', 'fossils', 'something', 'why', 'arrive', 'planet', 'bury', 'ships', 'then', 'only', 'return', 'thousands', 'years', 'later', 'Were', 'aliens', 'thinking', 'Okay', 'wo', ""n't"", 'eradicate', 'humans', 'now', ""'ll"", 'just', 'leave', 'stuff', 'here', 'come', 'back', 'few', 'millenia', 'do', 'then', 'point', 'illogic', 'fact', 'aliens', 'ride', 'around', 'tripods', 'giant', 'three-legged', 'walkers', 'Why', 'three', 'legs', 'not', 'four', 'table', 'four', 'legs', 'much', 'more', 'stable', 'table', 'three', 'so', 'why', 'ride', 'around', 'vehicles', 'three', 'legs', 'instead', 'four', 'vehicles', 'are', 'defective', 'design', 'finale', 'disappointing', 'too', ""'m"", 'aware', 'might', 'be', 'spoiling', 'ending', 'book', 'been', 'out', 'better', 'part', 'century', 'movie', 'been', 'out', 'better', 'part', 'decade', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'aliens', 'are', 'defeated', 'same', 'way', 'big', 'final', 'clash', 'humans', 'aliens', 'aliens', 'just', 'get', 'sick', 'die', ""'d"", 'think', 'such', 'technologically-advanced', 'aliens', 'would', 'least', 'know', 'something', 'virology', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'big-budget', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'ending', 'aliens', 'dying', 'sniffles', 'just', 'anti-climactic.The', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'moments', 'initial', 'alien', 'attack', 'standoff', 'Ferriers', 'angry', 'mob', 'trying', 'steal', 'van', 'river', 'bodies', 'speeding', 'train', 'engulfed', 'flames', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'tense', 'scene', 'Ferriers', 'trying', 'hide', 'aliens', 'basement', 'scene', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'basement', 'scene', 'alien', 'movie', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Signs.Speaking', 'Signs', 'Spielberg', 'be', 'trying', 'strike', 'middle', 'ground', 'intimate', 'family', 'story', 'Signs', 'bombast', 'Independence', 'Day', 'feel', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'especially', 'films', 'suffered', 'serious', 'story', 'flaws', 'too', 'Signs', 'water-allergic', 'aliens', 'invading', 'planet', 'made', 'up', 'mostly', 'water', 'aliens', 'Independence', 'Day', 'never', 'heard', 'Norton', 'AntiVirus', '.Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'good', 'alien', 'movie', 'illogical', 'moments', 'underwhleming', 'finale', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'great', 'Spielberg', 'alien', 'movies', 'easily', 'weakest', 'one']",N/A

Cruise is a crane operator and when his shift is over his boss is begging him to stay longer because he's the best crane operator he has.  He gets home and we're treated to what feels like 20 minutes of Cruise arguing with his kids.  Aliens briefly show up killing all electricity except for camcorders and shoot everybody except for Cruise.  Cruise then shows a mechanic how to fix a van; he takes the van and drives very fast down a highway that is clear of all disabled vehicles.  Oh and by the way he argues with his kids through it all nonstop.Finally he gets to a relative's house and argues with his kids some more, they go to sleep.  In the morning a large airplane falls on the house but not his van so they drive around some more...still arguing non-stop.  They even get out of the van once and scream at each other on the side of the road.  Later they get to a town with a ferry and when the soldiers tell the 100,000 or so people to stop boarding Cruise just runs around them!By now we haven't seen the aliens for like 45 minutes so they show up and dump over the ferry.  Cruise and kids swim safely to shore and this is where the script really kicks into anti-entertainment mode.I won't get into it because I want to put the whole terrible experience behind me but lets just say it gets really slow...and Cruise even sings at one point!

635117,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00005JNTI,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 8]","H.G. Wells created the aliens-attack formula over a century ago, in the classic ""War of the Worlds,"" and Orson Welles' radio drama caused mass panic. So even if Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" were a good movie, it would have a lot to live up to.And between the idiotic aliens, lackluster script and the screeching children, it's not a good movie.  It's another vehicle for Tom ""Last Samurai"" Cruise to act like a hero in. Yes, indeed -- between impregnating grinning starlets, enraging half the AMA, and leaping on Oprah's couch, Tom Cruise actually made a movie... a bad one.The story: Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is not having a good week: His ex-wife (Miranda Otto) has just left the kids with him for the next few days, and the kids hate him. To make matters worse, aliens invade, and Ray and his kids must escape their home and find sanctuary with his ex-in-laws, who live in a safe upper-class suburb. (WHY is it safe? We're never told)Easier said than done. Alien tripods are savaging the city -- some of them rising out of the earth -- and the populace is (understandably) panicking. Ray and his children struggle to escape, only to have his son get lost in the muddle.That's pretty much the plot -- and it isn't much. The main bulk of the movie is Cruise and kids hiding from the tripods, running, screaming, hiding, running, and repeating. While Spielberg tries to throw a few loops in the story -- the son going missing, for example -- we don't doubt that everything will turn out okay at the end. For Ray and his family.Ah yes, Spielberg -- the guy who brought us ""E.T.,"" ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Indiana Jones"" makes a misstep in ""War of the Worlds."" This movie is simply too flimsy for him to salvage. He does manage some truly stunning moments with the tripods, which are excellent displays of CGI. And if they had made up the movie, it would have rocked.But it isn't. The script is plagued with a hair-raising lack of logic. Very little about this movie actually makes any sense. If the aliens have been planning this for millennia, why did they wait to invade? Why not check what would be dangerous do them? Why didn't anyone detect the buried tripods before? And most important: is it because of Cruise that the movie has a nasty smack of Scientology? (Check references: Xenu, ancient invasions, alien souls, and all the rest of it)And finally, the acting isn't up to par either. Cruise does his usual bland action-hero shtick, while Justin Chatwin sneers and Dakota Fanning screeches. They do this for the remainder of the film. Tim Robbins and a visibly pregnant Otto do good jobs, but they are on too briefly for their performances to register.In a movie with no logic and no good acting, the tripods are what are really striking. And yes, they are creepy, scary and weird-looking.

Well, the best thing I can say about this film is yes it's a great test for your home theater subwoofer, and I'm happy to report that mine delivered the goods well.The film's most glaring weakness is mediocre acting from Tom Cruise (no surprise there) and especially Justin Chatwin who plays his son Robbie, both of whom were completely outclassed and upstaged by little 11-year old Dakota Fanning, hilariously enough!  The scene where Cruise attempts to sing a lullaby to Fanning was especially ridiculous, this man emotes about as skillfully as one of the Martians themselves.  Tim Robbins and especially Miranda Otto do their best but their talent is wasted on far too little screen time.Also why on earth Spielberg felt that he had to show the Martians is puzzling, since any visual representation of them is bound to be disappointing---more so here because he makes them more or less resemble a cross between the ""Aliens"" monster and Yoda.Maybe because Fanning is the most competent and sympathetic actor in the whole movie, Spielberg reduces this film to ""can cute but hysterical/helpless little girl be saved from the evil Martians?""  I have not read the novel but as I understand it Wells' book had a lot more social and political commentary...too bad Spielberg buries it with his usual shlock-a-block approach.  The closest thing to a glimpse of social insight was the mob scene where Cruise's minivan gets commandeered, but that's about it.On the other hand I was relieved that Spielberg did not turn this into yet another ""Die Hard"" type, moronic ""ordinary-Joe-turns-into-worldsaving-hero"" flick---Cruise does manage to take down one of the Martian vehicles but mercifully does not morph into the world messiah that Hollywood flicks love to inflict upon us.",2,what a DUD...,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,2123,"['main', 'thing', 'kept', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'curiousity', 'how', 'well', 'new', 'Mirage', 'S12', 'subwoofer', 'was', 'going', 'handle', 'much-talked', 'LFE', 'Low', 'Frequency', 'sound', 'Effects', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'cinematography', 'was', 'kind', 'cool', 'combination', 'documentary', 'grainy-ness', 'sepia', 'tint', 'eery', 'clarity', 'overexposure', 'digital', 'film', 'Well', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'yes', 'great', 'test', 'home', 'theater', 'subwoofer', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'mine', 'delivered', 'goods', 'well.The', 'film', 'most', 'glaring', 'weakness', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'surprise', 'there', 'especially', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'who', 'son', 'Robbie', 'whom', 'were', 'completely', 'outclassed', 'upstaged', 'little', '11-year', 'old', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'hilariously', 'enough', 'scene', 'where', 'Cruise', 'sing', 'lullaby', 'Fanning', 'was', 'especially', 'ridiculous', 'man', 'as', 'skillfully', 'one', 'Martians', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'especially', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'do', 'best', 'talent', 'wasted', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time.Also', 'why', 'earth', 'Spielberg', 'felt', 'had', 'show', 'Martians', 'puzzling', 'visual', 'representation', 'bound', 'be', 'disappointing', '-more', 'so', 'here', 'more', 'less', 'resemble', 'cross', 'Aliens', 'monster', 'Yoda.Maybe', 'Fanning', 'most', 'competent', 'sympathetic', 'actor', 'whole', 'movie', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'can', 'cute', 'hysterical/helpless', 'little', 'girl', 'be', 'saved', 'evil', 'Martians', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'understand', 'Wells', 'book', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'social', 'political', 'commentary', 'too', 'bad', 'Spielberg', 'buries', 'usual', 'shlock-a-block', 'approach', 'closest', 'thing', 'glimpse', 'social', 'insight', 'was', 'mob', 'scene', 'where', 'Cruise', 'minivan', 'commandeered', 'it.On', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'relieved', 'Spielberg', 'did', 'not', 'turn', 'yet', 'Die', 'Hard', 'type', 'moronic', 'ordinary-Joe-turns-into-worldsaving-hero', 'flick', '-Cruise', 'manage', 'take', 'down', 'one', 'Martian', 'vehicles', 'mercifully', 'not', 'morph', 'world', 'messiah', 'Hollywood', 'flicks', 'love', 'inflict']",N/A

635123,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00005JNTI,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","Despite the pedigree of Spielberg, this is not a well crafted film.  The cinematography and FX are superb, the screen adaptation is desperately lacking.  It was a huge mistake to hinge the entire piece on unlikable characters.  Tom Cruise plays deadbeat dad, Ray Ferrier (I wouldn't let him raise snails).  He has the requisite angry son (Justin Chatwin towing that clich&eacute; line to a fault).  And sadly, Ray is also saddled with a screaming, fit throwing daughter (Dakota Fanning).  All three are so thoroughly unpleasant that one doesn't care what happens to them.  I just wanted them out of the way so I could concentrate on the ferocious action going on all around them.  If those aliens had gotten a better look at this family, I think they would have been less envious, as claimed by Morgan Freeman's opening salvo.  Throwing wacky Tim Robbins into the mix was just asking for trouble.  What this movie needed was less After School Special melodrama and more Sci-fi adventure.  I wanted to see more scenes like the speeding train on fire or the night it rained clothes.  Even worse, the end just silently fizzled with but a brief glimpse of Gene Barry & Ann the screamer Robinson.  That ending couldn't have been more dismissive.Still, for all the cool bits, like the airplane strewn all over, and the pesky aliens exploring the basement, this film has just enough rudimentary excitement to make it almost worth having to view the worst family in the neighborhood running amok.

635126,A87C6ICDWYJQQ,B00005JNTI,Ellis Fowler,"[5, 8]","All the Technical aspects are top notch, and the Special Effects are unbelievable. Heck, I thought that the Score was excellent. It had more of a 50's Monster Movie sound to it, which I thought was perfect.For the purposes of this review, I'll stick with the humans at the center of the film.Tom Cruise- I have no real issue with him. I've never been a follower, but I have watched and enjoyed a number of his films. And I'll grant him this: He works hard. I haven't seen all of his films, but in all the ones I have seen, it's quite evident that he's working hard to pull the project together. I can't recall seeing a film of his in which he just phoned in the role.He could easily coast on his name, his good looks, or even his Star Power (if such a thing truly exists anymore), but he doesn't. That alone perhaps explains his continued relevance.Of course, he's not the best at what he does. Contrary to what some may say though, he is very capable. He raised his bar to play opposite Paul Newman in The Color of Money. Dustin Hoffman could have easily plowed him under in Rain Man, but he more than held his own. In Jerry Maguire, Cruise is quite believable as a man who's gradually discovering that a conscience actually exists underneath the slick facade, and that he's personally capable of much more than that which his chosen field will allow. In addition, he was very good in his 'man on the run' role in the 15 minutes too long but otherwise excellent Minority Report, his first collaberation with Spielberg.With that being said, he need not be in this movie, but it has nothing to do with him.He's perfectly fine in this movie. It's just that there's nothing in the role that couldn't be handled by either an unknown or a second-tier celebrity who could've used the break.Now, I have heard about how Cruise's attachment to the project is what ultimately allowed it be given the Green Light, and his starring role was part of the deal. However, this suggests that Spielberg's name didn't carry enough weight on its own, and considering that just about everybody saw this as being the perfect marriage of material and director, I seriously doubt the validity of the tale.Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin- Nothing more than useless brats. I do not recall children being in the original novel, and none were needed here. Chatwin's rebellious grown-child-of-divorce bit was one overplayed note, and Fanning seemed less like a scared little girl and more like a robot simply screaming on cue (On a side note: even when she was a little girl, Fanning was never believable as a little girl, and this may be due to her being in front of the camera her entire life. Has she ever had the chance to truly live the life of a child? Probably not. Ms. Fanning, your future therapist will be on line one). I was rooting for the tripods to reduce the kids to ash.Steven Spielberg- I've been a fan since E.T. and Jaws is my favorite movie (I've seen it countless times, and I'm looking into purchasing a Blue-Ray player just so I can buy it when it comes out on Blue-Ray).  I can find positives in nearly all of his films (with Hook being the lone exception; it should never have seen the light of day) and this is no different.For War of the Worlds, I would describe Spielberg's style as being brutal and efficient, much like the aliens. Yes, there are a number of scenes at the beginning of the film that are designed to introduce the two little cretins, and, of course, there is the happy ending where the fractured family is made whole. However, in between there is an entire film in which the stakes are raised higher and higher, and there appears to be no relief forthcoming. There's no real fluff, with virtually no humor, and 9/11 allusions can be found in the plane crash and the Missing Persons board. To me, it appears that Spielberg took a more Documentary-style approach to the film.The aliens are presented as an unstoppable force that cannot be beat by anything we have to throw at them. Indeed, it seems the only thing the U.S. Military can do is be defeated on every front as our technology is useless.  Only Nature can take the aliens down.For me, the sequence in the town square in which a tripod comes up from below ground is the best part of the film. Even though this doesn't quite rise up to Jurassic Park's level, it reminded me of the 9 minute T-Rex sequence in that Spielberg could have chosen a far easier way to shoot but didn't. In JP, by choosing to film a large part from within the confines of the jeeps, the danger becomes that much more real, and the suspense is amped up by giving the viewer more of a ""you are there"" quality.In War of the Worlds, he elects to shoot the inital appearance from behind the Tripod, allowing it to rise up in between the camera and the actors. He didn't cut the Special Effects team any breaks by forcing them to include the Tripod in any number of shots, such as the reflections on the glass, or even on the camcorder viewscreen. This makes the entire sequence that much more intense.Even though the Martians in the Basement is nothing more than a repeat of the Raptors in the Kitchen from JP, that doesn't mean it isn't intense. Spielberg may have borrowed from his own catalogue, but that doesn't make it any less effective this time around.Ultimately, the film left me cold, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. I could not overlook the bratty behavior of the kids. The fact that they kept their hostility toward their father, even though the current state of the world made their concerns appear more useless and selfish than anything, chased me away from fully embracing the film.",3,"On a Technical Level, the film is a marvel",1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,5646,"['Technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Special', 'Effects', 'are', 'unbelievable',

635129,A1HBEX2D49HWGD,B00005JNTI,"Emmett Glenn ""Emmett Glenn""","[4, 10]","Last night, I put Steven Spielberg's ""The War of the Worlds"" DVD in the player and started eating my dinner in the living room - just as I would do if I were going to watch, say, a Roger Corman film with Vincent Price.I was not expecting a great film.  I was not exactly looking forward to spending two hours with Tom Cruise either.  But I'm a big fan of the 1953 George Pal version of ""War of the Worlds,"" so I thought I'd give Spielberg's a shot.The music starts and it's oh-so-dramatic.  ""Okay, the music's pretty good,"" I thought, ""but it's not going to sucker me into thinking this is a good movie.""  Then the narrator begins and it sounds like/must be Morgan Freeman.  ""I like Morgan Freeman,"" I said aloud.  ""Why would he lend his talents to this film?""Ten minutes into the film, I had forgotten all about my dinner.The story takes no time to unfold, and it unfolds in a powerful way.  More importantly, you immediately identify with the central characters because they have been molded so perfectly by Spielberg's direction.  Cruise's performance is understated, believable, and not a distraction.The backbone of the movie is a story about a man who must redeem himself n the eyes of his children.  Cruise plays an irresponsible divorcee who assumes his children's lack of respect for him is everyone's fault but his own.  ""It's not my problem"" is something one might hear him say a lot.Cruise is asked by his ex-wife to care for the children while she is away for the weekend at her parents' home in Boston.  It is during this weekend together that he undergoes a metamorphosis and does indeed redeem himself in the eyes of his children.Sounds like any run-of-the-mill plot, doesn't it?  Spend a weekend together with the kids, learn a few lessons about each other, and - voila! - all their are problems solved.  Wasn't that the plot for ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and ""On Golden Pond""?Well, this wasn't your ordinary run-of-the-mill weekend in the city or in the country.  This weekend took place in suburbia, and it fell on a weekend that aliens just happened to decide to invade planet Earth.And what an invasion!Little by little, amidst all the horror and terror, Cruise manages to redeem himself in the eyes of his children -- mostly because he was such a jerk to begin and any little act he does in the course of the invasion to protect his children from harm turns him into a hero in their eyes.  At first, his objective is to get the children their mother in Boston.  But the Good Parenting bug infects him after a while and his primary goal is to just keep his kids from getting killed.  Or eaten.  But more on that later.Cruise's youngest child is played by Dakota Fanning (a dead-on look-alike for a prepubescent Madonna).  In the beginning of the film, she comes across as a little too adult:  ""That's not how you're going to get through to him,"" she says to her father after he loses yet another war of words with his son.Justine Chatwin, a newcomer to Hollywood, plays Cruise's teenaged son.  His character is angry, rebellious, lazy, and old enough to be full of disdain for his father.  The turn-about in his relationship with dad takes place off screen, after he leaves them to ""join the war.""While the son is off (either dead or battling the aliens), Cruise has time alone with his daughter.  Well, not quite alone.  They get invited by crazy Tim Robbins to hide out in his basement.  The aliens pay a visit after a while, and they all hide in terror.  Robbins goes completely insane and risks all their lives.  Cruise does something unspeakable to the man, but he does it to protect his daughter; thus, his redemption.The plot, told from the point of view of one man (Cruise), has everyone running for their lives from the aliens' machines (the equivalent of our miltary tanks, except these machines walk on three legs).  Their firepower is awesome and the human race, with all its military might, is quickly defeated.And now that the aliens have won, they can settle down and get down to the business of eating.  People who were not vaporized become their food source.  These aliens don't waste a morsel either.  Leftovers are sprayed out of huge hoses onto the groundas fertilizer.  Alien weeds immediately start to grow all over the place -- blood red weeds, mind you -- until nearly every surface on the planet is covered with them.  (This was Wells' cute explanation as to why Mars appears red in our sky).Of course, in the end, the aliens die.  (If you think I just gave away the ending, remember that this movie was filmed on our planet, so we have to win).The first clue that the alien lifeform is incompatible with planet earth's ecosystem is that all the weeds start to die.The 1953 version had the aliens die by saying they breathed our germ-infested air and died from some sort of respiratory disease.  This version, we learned they died because they consumed our germ-infested bodies.  So, in a sense, the aliens died from something similar to mad cow disease.  They got bad meat.If I can get a little highbrow for a moment, thematically, the destructive aliens are actually the personification of the destructive forces that are ""killing"" the relationship between Cruise and his children.  The ""alien-ness"" between the guy and his kids must be stopped.  By bonding with his children, he is destroying that ""alien-ness.""Technically, the C.G.I effects are nothing short of brilliant...and believable!  Not once did I think something look ""odd"" and unreal on film.  I must admit that I have a certain kind of fondness for the clunky copper sting ray ships that were suspended from visible wires in the 1953 version.  But the computer animators who worked on this film either had an extraordinary amount of talent or the software has gotten so much better.The widescreen version is presented in 1:85  -- not a very widescreen for such an epic film.  The film is dark and murky and this really comes across on the DVD transfer.  The sound mix is very good and if you have the luxury of viewing this film while the volume on your 5.1 sound receiver is turned up high, you will truly enjoy being immersed in the action.The 2-disc collectors edition includes a separate DVD of features that includes a plethora of interviews with Steven Spielberg and the cast, including a short documentary about the 1953 version.  This documentary features the lead actors who appeared in the '53 version.  They play Cruise's ex-wife's parents and are seen only at the end of the film.My advice is to not think of this film as a remake or as an adaptation of Wells' book.  Instead, imagine that Spielberg got an ""idea"" from an old movie and an old book and decided to make his own film.  That way, you won't have any preconcieved notions about what this film SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  If you do, then you will most likely be disappointed.I enjoyed the film.  I knew the movie would end happily ever after (it's an American film made in Hollywood by Mr. Hollywood himself), and watching the journey of Cruise delivering his children to their mother could have been boring if not for the spectacular special effects.Darken the room and turn up the volume.  More than anything else, this movie is one heck of a sensory experience",5,War of the Worlds 2005 - A Sensory Experience,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,7231,"['Last', 'night', 'put', 'Steven',

635130,A3W0POMI33YQXQ,B00005JNTI,"Enlightened ""Both Eyes Closed, see what u don...","[11, 19]","This movie was horrible.  It was a complete waste of my time.  First off there was hardly any background thrown in.  The movie just jumped right into the action, and for most movies, thats fine to do but for this one it wasn't.  They could have given some type of explanation as to how some dumbasses could build a city over some alien space ships.  We have all this technology and satelites and what else radar and everything but we couldn't see a big a$$ space ship coming to destroy earth?  They couldn't see an outline of all these space ships buried underneath the ground from their billion dollar satelites?  Ok past that, somehow the space ships got underground without our knowledge we can live with that.  What happens next?Oh yea...an Earthquake shakes the ground and something is obviously not right with this situation and what do the people of the city do?  They come right by the earth cracking and stand there and look at the ground like idiots.  Ok we can live with that...there are some dumb people in the world.  Then what happens?  The tripods come out of the ground looking almighty and powerful but guess what the people are still just standing there looking like idiots.  I admit there were a couple smart people in the movie that took off running immediately but the majority of the people just stood there.  Even worse, the thing started shooting lasers and the people were STILL just standing waiting to get killed.  I tell you people ain't that dumb to not be able to sense danger.  Then what happens next?Seeing that this thing is about to cause major destruction everybody starts running (first smart thing about the film); well that is everyone except Tom Cruise (I don't even remember his name in the film) who intelligently hides behind an open car door like it's immune to alien technology.  Then he finally starts running like a madman and the aliens are doing there best NOT to hit him but instead vaporize everyone else directly around him.  Tom Cruise does his Barry Sanders impersonation dodging all danger tossed his way.  Tom Cruise hit the L1 button for sure!!!Ok so we realize this is a movie and the main character can't get vaporized in the first few minutes so we live with it.  So he gets back to his house and tells his family to pack up but they are looking stupid asking all these questions when the dad is supposed to be the authority.  Then they miraculously steal the only working car that the mechanic has fixed.  But ironically nobody else in the world could think of replacing the one part that was damaged that made the car not work.  Then the aliens again do their best to miss Tom Cruise and his family as they vaporize the mechanic standing right next to the car but not them.  Trust me there are a lot of things wrong with this movie.The car they drive has unlimited gas as they drive across the country (really just from NY to Boston and across some back roads but still that's a good ways).  They go to the mothers real house to find it abandoned and unlocked.  They stay the night and a plane crashes into the house. But the plane magically completely misses the car so they hop in and just start driving.  They stop to take a bathroom break and Dakota Fanning runs a mile away and almost falls in the river. When they were riding through a crowd and the mob tried to stop them Tom Cruise didn't fire his gun...instead he gets dragged out the car and he and his son get beat up and get the car stolen.  Then he grabs the gun and shoots in the air once and everybody in this angry mob stops and looks at him instead of running at the sound of gunshots in a crowded area.  Shooting a gun is supposed to create chaos in a big crowd like that.  They end up walking to a ferry with the same group that they were fighting with where there is of course not enough room.  Through all those people they somehow meet up with some people they know. They somehow force their way on to the boat through army security.  When the boat gets bombed they miraculously are the only people to escape and they do so by swimming half a mile without the tripods shooting them down like they do everything else moving.All of a sudden Cruise's son gets brave and decides he wants to fight aliens.  Why, I don't know seeing as he just got punished by regular people less than 15 minutes earlier in the film.  What does he think he is gonna do to an alien?  He was the sole one responsible for his younger sister and he just completely abandons her.  So he separates and gets blasted to smithereens less than a minute later.  Then they get into a cellar with a crazy man that wants to wage war with his shotgun.  So Cruise ends up having to kill him with his bare hands but the other dude had a shovel and a shotgun and cruise still came out on top unscathed.  Then they get snatched up by a machine only to figure out the machines aren't killing people when they pick them up they are storing them for some type of energy and only when cruise gets picked up do the other people decide to try to stop the machine.  Then he miraculously destroys it with one little grenade.They then end up getting to the city where the childs mother is supposedly at and then all the machines suddenly start malfunctioning and stopping on their own.  By this time you are already sick of this film.  The jist of that was that all the machines pretty much shut themselves down.  Then they make it back to the mother's house which has not been damaged at all looks like a nice quiet little inlet in Boston...no trouble...the tripods just decided to leave that area alone and then out of the blue guess who pops up?  Cruise's son!  What is this?!?!  How did he get back?  Didn't we see him get blown to smithereens?  Oh lawd this is stupid.  And then the explanation of the machines malfunction was because of bacteria and viruses on earth.PUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My sister and I left the movies so mad like ""that was STOOOPID"".  Not regular stupid, but stooooopid. And the title was misleading...there was no war of the worlds...it should have been called ""Massacre of Earth Until The Viruses Kick In"".  This movie was stupid.  Independence Day is 1000 times better than this...I would never buy this movie unless its in the bargain bin.  Look for this movie at the dollar movie soon and to be on DVD by Christmas.  This one is a dud.  The movie didn't really have a point.  I love movies and I rarely think any movie is less than 3 stars but this one sure is.  In the movies I couldn't stop looking at my cell phone to see what time it was.  1.5 stars.",2,I'm Not The One To Call A Movie Horrible but....,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,6625,"['movie', 'was',

The movie takes way too long to develop its plot; it just goes on and on and on and on. And Tom Cruise's kids are not believable. Dakota, the little girl, screams in a very fake way in a couple of scenes. Unfortunately, it's too forced. The kids as a whole, are more annoying than anything and their acting is not up to par! There are many nice ""visuals"" and these tend to drag on too long. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the citizens are shown like a million times! Enough! We know they are there!

635132,A146D2LYLICNLS,B00005JNTI,eric_f,"[12, 23]","Sad to say, this is the first Steven Spielberg movie that I've come out of the theater feeling disappointed with. The trailer looked so promising that one logically assumed that the rest of the film would be just as good. Not the case here. This movie should have been titled ""Tom Cruise's relationship with his 2 children, with a minor subplot involving some alien spaceships trying to destroy mankind."" But that wouldn't bring in the big bucks, now would it?This movie feels like a rough draft of a better, more cohesive movie. The best words I can think of to describe it are flat, uninspiring and oftentimes, downright dull. So much time is spent on Tom and Dakota hiding in basements that one actually forgets that this movie is about aliens attacking. And when the action finally gets going, we simply don't care. In fact one scene shows the alien tripods firing their weapons from a large distance away. How are we, the audience, supposed to get involved in it? And towards the end it shows the city of Boston demolished, and yet we never get to see it. We're only shown the aftermath. Another rip-off. The only worthwhile action sequence was the first one, when the aliens appear out of the ground and begin vaporizing people and cleaning house. This scene is worth the price of admission. If only the other action scenes were as good. Not that I'm one of those moviegoers who can only like a movie if it has non-stop action. I appreciate a good plot to go along with it. But ""War of the Worlds"" only offers a paper-thin plot.In terms of acting, no standout performances here. Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise...adequate, but nothing extraordinary. Dakota Fanning, whom I've liked in other movies, is simply annoying here. Most of her ""acting"" consists of screaming, crying, and staring bug-eyed into the camera. Tim Robbins steals the show although he is wasted. It makes me wonder what this movie would have been like if he had taken on the lead role.Oh yeah, and let's not forget about the cliches. Case in point, when Cruise is constantly able to walk away from disasters completely unharmed while almost everyone else is killed. The worst cliche for me came when the snake-like alien device was searching for humans in the basement. I was thinking to myself, ""any second now Dakota Fanning is going to knock over a tin can or make another mistake and cause the alien to turn back and look for them again."" Sure enough, that's exactly what happened.I could go on but I won't. This movie was simply a let-down. It's the equivalent of seeing a nice tall cold glass of soda on a hot summer day, gulping it, only to discover that it's been sitting for days and is flat. But you can't spit it out since you've already swallowed it.If you must see a movie with a Cruise/Spielberg collaboration, watch ""Minority Report"" instead.

635134,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00005JNTI,Erik North,"[3, 7]","Ever since H.G. Wells' classic novel ""War Of The Worlds"" appeared in 1898, it has never fallen too far out of the public conscience.  In its original book form, Wells intended it as a warning against the rampant colonialism of his native Britain.  In Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast version of the book, its concept of alien invaders sparked the most rampant form of hysteria America had seen up to that point.  And in George Pal's celebrated 1953 filming, it tapped into America's Cold War anxieties.  Now, in 2005, in post-9/11 America, director Steven Spielberg has put it back squarely in the public eye with incredible results.People who might tag Spielberg as the man behind friendly alien stories like CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and E.T. might conveniently forget such terror classics as DUEL, JAWS, and JURASSIC PARK.  It is this latter side that he taps into in this story of a deadbeat dad (Tom Cruise) who only gets his act together with his son (Justin Chatwin) and young daughter (MAN ON FIRE's Dakota Fanning) when alien invaders wreak havoc throughout New England, and he finds that there is no place to hide from the them, not even out on Long Island, nor on the backroads between New York and Boston.  The military is powerless to stop the alien invasion, and it is only because of Nature itself that the alien beasts are finally defeated, much in the same way that the 1953 film climaxed.Spielberg's classic themes of an irresponsible father forced into assuming responsibility and ordinary people under extraordinary (and in this case terrifying) circumstances combines with a typically cocksure Cruise character to make this more than a mere clone of the dreadfully overblown INDEPENDENCE DAY dressed in H.G. Wells garb.  Not surprisingly, of course, the special effects are the big attraction here.  So too, however, is the hysteria, paranoia, and unease we see and can relate to in our post-9/11 world.  While Spielberg asserts that we need to be brave and keep our humanity in the face of this extreme danger, he also suggests a certain cynicism with unilateral military action to deal with the aliens (vis-a-vis our modern-day overseas actions), a trait he shares with many of his fellow baby-boomers from the 60s, and that this film shares with the 1953 original.Cruise, whatever people may think of his Scientology beliefs, excels under Spielberg's sure-handed direction, as does Fanning.  Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, who both starred in the 1953 classic, have brief cameos at the end as the parents of Cruise's wife (Miranda Otto).  (MILD SPOILER: Spielberg had worked with Barry before, on ""L.A. 2017"", a sci-fi-oriented episode of the NBC-TV series ""The Name Of The Game"" which aired to solid ratings on January 15, 1971, a significant early credit for Spielberg, who was only twenty-four at the time).By making WAR OF THE WORLDS still mean something today, Spielberg has made yet another in a seemingly endless series of career-defining movies, continuing his pre-eminence among all Hollywood filmmakers as a master and a successor to legends like Hitchcock, Kubrick, and others.",5,Spielberg Revives A Timeless Sci-Fi Classic,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,3103,"['Ever', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'classic', 'novel', 'War', 'Worlds', 'appeared', '1898', 'never', 'fallen', 'too', 'far', 'public', 'conscience', 'original', 'book', 'form', 'Wells', 'intended', 'warning', 'rampant', 'colonialism', 'native', 'Britain', 'Orson', 'Welles', '1938', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'version', 'book', 'concept', 'alien', 'invaders', 'sparked', 'most', 'rampant', 'form', 'hysteria', 'America', 'had', 'seen', 'up', 'point', 'George', 'Pal', 'celebrated', '1953', 'filming', 'tapped', 'America', 'Cold', 'War', 'anxieties', 'Now', '2005', 'post-9/11', 'America', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'put', 'back', 'squarely', 'public', 'eye', 'incredible', 'results.People', 'who', 'might', 'tag', 'Spielberg', 'man', 'friendly', 'alien', 'stories', 'CLOSE', 'ENCOUNTERS', 'E.T', 'might', 'conveniently', 'forget', 'such', 'terror', 'classics', 'DUEL', 'JAWS', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'latter', 'side', 'story', 'deadbeat', 'dad', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'only', 'act', 'together', 'son', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'young', 'daughter', 'MAN', 'ON', 'FIRE', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'when', 'alien', 'invaders', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'New', 'England', 'place', 'hide', 'not', 'even', 'out', 'Long', 'Island', 'backroads', 'New', 'York', 'Boston', 'military', 'powerless', 'stop', 'alien', 'invasion', 'only', 'Nature', 'alien', 'beasts', 'are', 'finally', 'defeated', 'much', 'same', 'way', '1953', 'film', 'climaxed.Spielberg', 'classic', 'themes', 'irresponsible', 'father', 'forced', 'assuming', 'responsibility', 'ordinary', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'case', 'terrifying', 'circumstances', 'combines', 'typically', 'cocksure', 'Cruise', 'character', 'make', 'more', 'mere', 'clone', 'dreadfully', 'overblown', 'INDEPENDENCE', 'DAY', 'dressed', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'garb', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'course', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'big', 'attraction', 'here', 'So', 'too', 'however', 'hysteria', 'paranoia', 'unease', 'see', 'can', 'relate', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'Spielberg', 'need', 'be', 'brave', 'keep', 'humanity', 'face', 'extreme', 'danger', 'also', 'certain', 'cynicism', 'unilateral', 'military', 'action', 'deal', 'aliens', 'vis-a-vis', 'modern-day', 'overseas', 'actions', 'trait', 'shares', 'many', 'fellow', 'baby-boomers', '60s', 'film', 'shares', '1953', 'original.Cruise', 'people', 'may', 'think', 'Scientology', 'beliefs', 'excels', 'Spielberg', 'sure-handed', 'direction', 'Fanning', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'Ann', 'Robinson', 'who', 'starred', '1953', 'classic', 'have', 'brief', 'cameos', 'end', 'parents', 'Cruise', 'wife', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'MILD', 'SPOILER', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'worked', 'Barry', 'before', 'L.A.', '2017', 'sci-fi-oriented', 'episode', 'NBC-TV', 'series', 'Name', 'Game', 'aired', 'solid', 'ratings', 'January', '15', '1971', 'significant', 'early', 'credit', 'Spielberg', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'twenty-four', 'time', '.By', 'making', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'still', 'something', 'today', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'yet', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'series', 'career-defining', 'movies', 'continuing', 'pre-eminence', 'Hollywood', 'filmmakers', 'master', 'successor', 'legends', 'Hitchcock', 'Kubrick', 'others']",N/A

Steven Spielberg directing? Tom Cruise in the lead?  A classic sci-fi story?  What could go wrong?  I'm sorry to say I was underwhelmed.  This one should have been a rental.I have never read the original H.G. Wells story, so for all I know, this is a fairly faithful rendition of the novel.  If so, maybe they should have taken some artistic license with the material.I wasn't a huge fan of ""Independence Day,"" but the special effects alone made it worth seeing.  ""Signs"" had very little in the way of effects, but it was much more suspenseful than this.  ""War of the Worlds"" seemed to split the difference in terms of the amount of effects and the way it presented its story, but it was less satisfying than either of those other films.Despite what I had heard about this film having big-budget special effects, I was left wondering where they spent the money.  Aside from the alien tripods (well done), the aliens themselves, and a bunch of explosions, there didn't seem to be much else.The one scene where it appeared there would be some good action was when we finally got to see the military confront the aliens.  It turned out to be a frustrating experience in that you never really got to see much of the fighting.  And the entire scene was interrupted by the ludicrousness of seeing civilian characters run 'towards' the carnage and mayhem, as if they couldn't die soon enough.  There were a couple other illogical plot points throughout the story, but I'll spare you the details if you haven't seen this.The only real suspense takes place in the basement, and is essentially a less-effective ripoff of the kitchen scene in ""Jurassic Park.""  The rest of the film is just Cruise running from explosions with kids in tow.  BTW, Tom Cruise's character never really grows on you; his kids even less so.Despite all of the above, ""War of the Worlds"" is not without some merits and is certainly worth seeing.  However, I would classify it as a rental and not a film for your DVD collection.Note that the one-disc version of this film is very bare-bones.  There isn't even a commentary track.

635139,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B00005JNTI,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[3, 4]","When you take one of the most famous works of 19th century science fiction, turn it into a 21st century blockbuster film by hiring a famous actor and an even more famous director for the production, expectations are high.  A lot of things can go wrong here, including being too footloose and fancy-free with the story or having that famous actor not know when to keep his mouth shut.Despite anything Tom Cruise has done or said recently, Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" should not be missed.  It doesn't matter if you think Cruise is the biggest jerk on the face of the planet, his work in this film is phenomenal.  But the movie doesn't rely solely on him, which is why it works.The original story, written by Englishman H. G. Wells in 1898 was social commentary on British colonization, and the manner in which ""civilized"" men coldly decimated native populations.  The plot hasn't changed much since then:  Aliens (Martians in the novel, but of indeterminate origin in the new film) mysteriously arrive in giant mechanical contraptions and begin vaporizing people with Death Rays, while our efforts to strike back are pitifully ineffective.In 1938, a radio adaptation narrated by Orson Welles caused widespread panic on the American East Coast, and a 1953 movie adaptation kept the story in the public consciousness long after the author's death.This latest film version takes advantage of the computer effects Spielberg himself pioneered with ""Jurassic Park"" and creates a far more realistic alien invasion than the now-laughable '53 movie.  But again, it's not just the incredible effects that give this film credibility.  Rather than having all of the alien invasion clich&eacute;s such as scientists, presidents, and generals in major roles or the destruction of famous landmarks (a la ""Independence Day""), the invasion is shown entirely from the eyes of an Average Joe.  Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) has his own maturity problems, but now he must protect his two children, Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin) during the attack.Similar to ""Signs"" where we never see anything our primary characters don't see, ""War of the Worlds"" feels like a documentary, with shaky camera moves during the initial destruction and almost any action scene.  While not quite dizzying, the movement is disorienting, complementing the tension.Spielberg is the master of making the experience of being scared somehow enjoyable.  By not showing the audience everything, he makes it even scarier and more interesting as we contemplate what might be there.Of the two major motion picture adaptations, this ""War of the Worlds"" is actually more faithful to the original novel despite being set in 21st century America rather than 19th century England.

635140,A3NFHA4PRM6QCU,B00005JNTI,Evil Lincoln,"[68, 105]","Here's the formula for ""War of the Worlds:""1. Alien tripods show up.2. Tom Cruise and his kids run from them.3. Repeat ad nauseam.4. End of movie.That's it.  That's the entirety of ""War of the Worlds.""  You'd think that if Earth were being decimated by aliens who planted gigantic three-legged walking tanks millions of years ago, there might be a good action movie somewhere in there, but no.  Steven Spielberg apparently thinks that what the audience wants to see is Tom Cruise's shaky relationship with his two kids and ex-wife.  Eleven-year-old Dakota Fanning is inexplicably receiving rave reviews for her performance, which consists solely of her screaming and smarting off to her father.There's a scene in the movie when Cruise's whiny brat of a teenage son is pleading desperately with the National Guard to let him tag along with them.  Cruise runs up and starts arguing with his son about their relationship or whatnot, while in the background we see tanks and Humvees full of troops going to take on the alien tripods.  I was thinking: you know what would be cool?  If we could see them fighting the aliens, instead of Tom Cruise fighting with his son!  One of the characters said that Europe was completely wiped out.  Wouldn't you have liked to see integrated into the movie?The whole movie is like that.  Right when the tripods start to attack, the focus shifts to Tom Cruise and his insufferable kids, and how they're dealing with it.  In that way, it reminded me of ""The Pianist,"" which follows a man's survival of the Holocaust by hiding out in the Warsaw Ghetto.  But the difference is, ""The Pianist"" is just a small story contained within a larger picture (the Holocaust and WWII) of which the audience is already likely familiar.  ""War of the Worlds"" focuses on the survival of one man at the expense of a larger picture, but the audience doesn't care about that: they want to see the aliens destroy stuff, and then the aliens get destroyed.Instead of seeing the aliens attack, we get stupid melodrama.  What little we do see of the invasion is pretty awesome, though, which just added to my disappointment.  The tripods are cool, and when they attack New York, it's just astounding.  There's a great scene where one of them rises from the Hudson River and overturns a ferry.But they're too few and far between.  There are other major problems, as well, the most glaring of which is that this movie desperately wants to be ""Independence Day"" (even the two movies' aliens are virtually identical) which is nothing that anything based on HG Wells should strive for.  I watched the silly and spectacular ""I.D."" the night before I saw ""WOTW,"" and ""WOTW"" is just so somber and dull in comparison.  Also, Tim Robbins appears in a glorified cameo as an insane ambulance driver.  He does a good job, but the scenes are completely pointless.The final flop is with the ending, if you can call it that.  Without giving any spoilers, nothing that happens in the last 15 minutes makes any sense at all.  I wouldn't expect *any* director to end a movie like that, much less Steven Spielberg.  There's an episode of ""The Simpsons"" where all the kids are stranded on an island (a la ""Lord of the Flies""), and then the episode ends with James Earl Jones, in voiceover, saying, ""So the children learned how to function as a society, and eventually they were rescued by, oh, let's say...Moe.""

Although it's certainly more like the latter as War of the Worlds is a dark, menacing, frightening tale of alien invasion. I would consider it the best alien invasion movie I have ever seen. Hopefully it will make people forget that dreadful Independence Day from nine years ago. Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp bring a unique perspective to the alien invasion genre. It's a smaller-scale movie which follows only Tom Cruise's character and his family instead of trying to juggle a huge cast of characters on a global scale. This decision results in the film being more realistic and more believable, and I believe more successful, as a whole. There are also no unnecessary shots of famous world monuments being blown up like in Independence Day. There's none of that film's campy silliness. War of the Worlds is always believable and it's very serious and very frightening. The characters are well-developed, but only as much as a movie of this sort requires. More importantly though, the characters are believable.  No government officials, no U.S. president, no wise-cracking, cigar-smoking Air Force pilots. That is the film's greatest attribute. It never sacrifices realism. The special effects are marvelous, but never excessive. The actors are excellent as well. Ultimately it's up to the actors to make the film believable. Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning completely sell the terror and menace. Despite the dark subject matter, this is obviously a Spielberg film. I was constantly aware of the master storyteller behind the camera. Even in a ""popcorn"" movie like this, Spielberg brings his  visual genius to the plate. He moves his camera like no one else,  and his direction is consistently stunning. In a few scenes he even uses some of the hand-held photography that made Saving Private Ryan so realistic.War of the Worlds is the Aliens-Invading-Earth movie that I have been waiting for. If you felt that Independence Day was just a silly, far-fetched disaster then check out War of the Worlds.

Wells authored the classic sci-fi novel War of The Worlds in 1898, Orson Welles' did a radio play which famously caused a frenzy as millions of horrified listeners in 1938 and in 1953 a film version was made of the story.  More recently the in the 1970s Jeff Wayne produced the musical version of War of The Worlds, which has been recently re-released after being remastered.  In between times there have been many films and television productions that have taken the story and presented it in one guise or another.  Now Steven Spielberg has produced a film about the War of The Worlds.  In the past Spielberg's aliens were cuddly and friendly (E.T. and Close Encounters of The Third Kind) but in this film the aliens are deadly and intent of destroying mankind.  The special effects really strike fear into the hearts of those watching this version of the story.  As always Steven Spielberg directs some large scale scenes that takes the breath away and convey a sense of the threat facing mankind.Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, an immature, divorced, dockworker and father, who is less than a perfect fatherly role model.  But all that changes when the aliens arrive as Cruise's character scrambles madly to get his family away to safety.  There are some genuinely frightening moments in this film and personally I found the tripods of the aliens sent a shiver down the spine.  But what H.G. Wells would have made of this film is difficult to say.  Quite frankly I think that an opportunity has been missed with this film and it is not one of Spielberg's best films.

Only a very few details from the book remain, such as the tripods fighting machines, the red weed and the way the aliens die.

Ogilvy, the astronomer, who, by the way, gets toasted in chapter 5.I will not criticise the quality of the movie which remains a good entertainment, but it should have carried another title. Two adaptations may carry that title: Jeff Waynes's musical version (and which remain the best adaptation ever) and... (gasp!)

However, every so often, a really good or really bad movie comes along truly worthy of the extra effort. This movie falls into the latter, really bad, category.Absolutely everything Tom Cruise does in this movie appears faked or contrived. When he acts like he's crying, it appears fake. When he is acts afraid, it appears fake. When he is acts angry, it appears fake. Based on his performance in this movie alone, one can only reasonably conclude this man just cannot act.At the same time, Spielberg seems utterly incapable of producing a believable movie. According to this Spielberg movie, the first thing one wants to do when the aliens show up in town is to literally fight to get aboard a slow moving, brightly lit, ferry boat with absolutely no means of escape. Utterly absurd. Since the premise is so unbelievable, I suspect they actually included this segment in the movie simply to have an opportunity to show a special effect sequence of a ferry sinking. Many other segments in the movie were just as unbelievable.While this movie is somewhat more true to HG Wells story than previous movies, it deviates from the book in several significant regards - including a disturbing murder by the lead character played by Tom Cruise. And, again bowing to nationalism like prior movies, the location was once again changed to the USA instead of London.There is very little about this movie I liked. The child playing Tom Cruise's daughter, looks and talks like a much older midget (with little demonstrated acting ability). The child playing Tom Cruise's son, looks like a vagrant or tramp (with an attitude problem). Neither of these children in the movie act like normal children their age, nor like children might act in this situation (how children do act in similar scary situations).Finally, based perhaps on the notion that nearly half the families in America end in divorce, it appears Spielberg (like so many other directors today) was simply compelled to feature a dysfunctional family in this movie instead of one more like the other half of the families in America. Just once, I would like to see a modern movie featuring a healthy family my own can identify with.If you're a Cruise or Spielberg fan, your standards are perhaps low enough for you to probably like this movie. However, if you're a science fiction or War of the Worlds fan, this movie will likely fall far short of your expectations. On the cover of the DVD, Gene Shalit (of Today) described this movie as ""Tom Cruise's finest performance,"" while Joel Seigel (of Good Morning America) described this as ""Steven Spielberg at his best.""

The bitter irony of the scene with the crushed plane and the reporters who are interested in the sensational story above everything were appropriate. The mass hysteria, the panic, the desire to survive no matter what were shown very believably in the scene where Ray (Tom Cruise) with the children in the car tried to get through the mad crowd - I think it was the highest moment of the movie - it all went downhill after that. I was not impressed by the ""underground"" scene - I think that the creators made a big mistake showing the aliens - these ridiculous creatures immediately brought to mind the dreadful ""The Signs"", and that was the last movie I want to think of or remember. The arm of the dead creature in the final scene was much more impressive. I also think that Tom Cruise was miscast -his youthful (very) appearance played against him, IMO - I could not believe that he was a father of these two kids.

(And why it was so different from the others.)My family was completely in love with the movie, but at first failed to understand some of its reasons for focusing on only the 1 family. Unlike other disaster films, War of the Worlds doesn't go all around the globe showing clips of buildings tumbling to the ground. No, this movie stays with one family. It brings a vision of what it could be like, if the world was attacked by another world. And it does this in a manner that haunts and horrifies.War of the Worlds also pleases action fans and has a sense of humor. My mom had a question about why they don't show certain characters after they split off from the family. People must remember that this flick is designed to focus in on the terror of only that family; not to go off on different silly stories, but remain true to this one.

Basic divorced guy at odds with his kids wants to spend a quite weekend getting to know them again....sort of.  Little does he know that aliens are invading.The thing I liked about the movie is that it is a rout from the very first instance the aliens arrive.  It follows very close to the book in that respect there is none of this lets upload a virus into the alien mother ship foolishness.  Although to be far Independence Day was a good movie as well.  I also liked that the movie relies strongly on the emotions of actors instead of just all the wiz bang special effects which are also there in plenty.  Some of the parts had me cringing and jumping out of my seat and I like to think of myself as a guy not easily scared especially when I already know what I am getting into (an alien invasion movie where lots of people die).  On that note it might be a good idea to leave young children at home.There are negative sides to the movie but overall the positive aspects wash these out.  Two main problems1.

Katsaros,"[2, 4]","All my life ive been a Steven Spielberg fan.He has made countless classics in science fiction in drama &in; adventure.A Academy Award winner man with so much imagination & vision he is considered one of the best directors ever.So when everybody heard he was going to direct War Of The Worlds the famous sci-fi book by H.G. Wells every cinema fan went crazy with the hype.We thought this was going to become another sci-fi classic.Man were many of us wrong.This tells the tale of a divorced man trying to reconnect with his kids abd trying to protect them while Aliens attack.Ill try to avoid spoilers but its difficult not to so i could explain some problems i had with the film.I mean this ilm starts off well.Were interested in the mystery of the weird events that are going on.This film i have to mention is very well made film on a technical aspect.But one of gripes is really the Aliens.First of all if they were planning this for thousands,millions of years why would they store those machines underground.Think about it.If a thousand years pass wont technology get enormously better.Look how we have changed in a thousand years.Id like to think they did as well or the aliens were overconfident and used older technology.Another thing the aliens only have tripods.What they never developed technology for hover crafts.Another thing the film drags in some instances.And the ending was perposterous.One of worst endings ever.I mean when I left the theater disappointment ran from almost every persons face.I mean dont want to say anymore but not to ruin the whole thing for people that havent seen it yet.I mean yes this film has great special effects.Good acting for the material.Great idea to set up a story.But a terrible script by David Koepp  and Josh Friedman that made no sense.I didn't expect that from David Koepp because he is not a bad writer.He has written Carlitos Way,Jurassic Park & other good movies that i enjoyed that are written better then this.Also this only the second production Josh Friedman has written.And i don't understand why Spielberg didn't think of changing it even a little bit.With his mind how could he.And of course we another collaboration of Spielberg with John Williams that never goes wrong.The music helps when needed.Its good score by Williams like in every film he has composed.But its not memaroble.Another thing this is not much of a action film.What i mean by that the action is good but very little.The acting is good for the material.Dakota Fanning shows that she a talent for the future and Tom Cruise is one of the ultimate stars there is.At least Spielberg will go back to winning ways in a artistic way making one of the most promising movies of 2005 Munich.Because in box office way he will never have a trouble.So let's just hope and wait for him to bring us the goods again.",2,One Of The Biggest Disappointments Of

I've seen it a couple of times more, and each time I realized this was a much better movie than I originally thought.

I just watched it, and while the content was great as usual, I saw a really lackluster transfer, with lots of grain, and lack of the clarity I see in a lot of other bluray discs. This movie was made in 2005, so there is no excuse for a tranfer other than pristine.  Some movies filmed in the 60's look better than this.

This Spielberg film sticks somewhat with the original book, but takes extravagant license with most of the storyline. HG foresaw an alien force utilizing walking tripod machines, primarily because the airplane hadn't been invented yet (although I don't know how he perceived their interplanetary travel!). His primary concern was of poison gases, which were being developed. Wars always utilize whatever new weapons have been invented and the aliens in his book make use of these. In WWI gases were banned by the new conventions, as they were so inhumane. Where Wells imagined the life blood of humans being utilized by the aliens is anybody's guess. The anomaly lies in the killing of the aliens by the microbes (only recently discovered in Well's time with increasing use of the microscope). An alien species would surely consider this and take precautions against it. The later submission with Gene Barry is updated, so that the aliens utilize flying machines. The novel does chill the blood in calling to our attention that aliens who would visit our solar system would PROBABLY NOT be benign, as our water planet is precious in the universe. Which brings us to the question of why NASA and SETI believe that aliens would be and have gone out of their way to advertise our existence to the universe...big mistake!! License taken by Spielberg which doesn't work is the suggestion that the alien machines have been here for millenia in preparation for a future utilization for incoming aliens wishing to take ownership of the planet. In addition, from the moment Fanning opens her mouth (probably the most  irritating little girl on this planet), we pray the aliens will vaporize her! There is not much 'acting' that goes on in this film, so Cruise does OK. The film is more a testimony to how disrespectful and irreverant American children have become in the last two generations!The film does illustrate how MOST American people would react to a catastrophic war situation in being totally unprepaired and unable to respond...a pathetic state of affairs. Other nations are more prepared for catastrophe! All in all an entertaining film, but lacking a descent storyline and script.

Dakota Fanning's character is a preteen high maintenance drama queen who's into New Age mumbo jumbo and is basically portrayed as a dead weight. By contrast, the Cruise character and his son have far fewer tics and quirks. The little girl is the most detailed character here, and she's memorable.  She's similar to the character of Alex in Jurassic Park who is portrayed, too, as a screamer and is made the object of at least one nasty sight gag.That aside, the movie was kind of diappointing and needed an update.  Let's face it, if the Martians---unnamed in this movie because they probably have better lawyers than Speilberg---can cross billions of miles of space, why can't they use anti-bacterial soap?  Also, at one point they're portrayed as eating humans. Why, then, do they vaporize so many of them? If they vaporize humans---when they're not eating them---where do the bodies in the river come from?  That was a bit jarring.It would have been a great deal more frightening had it been a bit updated. Cruise was not terribly convincing, but he wasn't awful, either. The special effects were amazing but they really supported a plot and a story that needed updating.  The holes were too obvious and had they been filled the movie would have been terrifying.

Tom Cruise gives a very low-key performance in his anti-hero becoming a hero in his role as the downtrodden father. Tim Robbins almost steals this movie in a standout performance as a man losing his humanity by events he can't control. The Cruise character seems to constantly evaluate events, regain his control and move on. He gains strength from his struggle and the weakness of the Robbins character.

635171,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JNTI,Grady Harp,"[4, 7]","The real dazzler about this reincarnation of an old story is that it IS the reincarnation of an old story.  H.G. Wells published his scary sci-fi novel in 1898, Orson Welles terrified the country in his 1938 radio drama version of the book, in 1953 the book became a film, and now in the time of terrorism Steven Spielberg makes the story not an invasion from Mars but an enemy from within the bowels of the globe. Quite a fest for a book over a hundred years old to still seem pertinent.Steven Spielberg once again proves he can outdo most anyone with costly productions.  His style is evident from the first moments when the actions seems centered on the broken family of Ray (Tom Cruise) and his ex-wife Maryann (Miranda Otto) as she leaves their children Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Ray (Justin Chatwin) with Ray in New Jersey while Maryann and her new husband take a trip to Boston.  The tension is obvious: Ray is not a father-type and finds communication with his children tedious at best. The Spielberg family drama recipe is set.The action starts almost immediately with newscasts of electrical field disturbances on the media and then the occurrence of lightning without thunder in New Jersey. In rapid motion the etiology of the altered weather is seen to be the emergence out of the ground of huge tripod machines that destroy everything in sight (""Is it terrorists?"" Rachel repeatedly asks, driving home the underlying tone of Spielberg's intention of making the story relevant to our time).  New Jersey is destroyed but Ray and the kids find a car that works and drives toward Boston for a reconciliation with Maryann.  What happens between New Jersey and Boston is a battle to end all battles during which time Ray discovers the importance of his fatherhood, the love of his children, and his own humbling recognition that he is but one member of the planet earth.The stars of the film are the extraordinary tripod machines, though Cruise and Fanning hold their own.  One leaves the film feeling it could have had more impact had it stuck more closely to the book, but then that's been done before.  Grady Harp, November 05",4,Reason to Recall the Impact of H.G.

Stupendous!!It quite possibly is one of the best sci fi movies ever, the audience I saw it with thought the same and gave the movie a standing ovation. Need I say more? Of course .It's based on the H.G. wells classic originally brought to life in the 1950's by acclaimed sci fi director George Pal who brought us such hits as ""The Time Machine"".Aliens have come to invade our planet and destroy us all. Their plans are simple as Tim Robbins character of Ogilvy says it's extermination!!!The people at Industrial Light and Magic which worked on such hits as ""Jurassic Park"", ""Willow"" and ""Terminator 2 Judgement Day"" should really be commended for bringing more top notch and award worthy special effecfs to the screen once agein!!!Spielberg like other good directors knows how to input the human element and heart just like he's done in other Blockbusters like ""ET"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".In fact this felt a lot like ""Close"": for many times, When the strange alien ships emerge, there is a great deal of human curiousity and intrigue around them, then when we see the Aliens true intentions we are in disbelief as to the amount of destruction that can be inflicted by  one ship.Even the Aliens have a persoanlity in this, they feed on us for food, and then conquer anything around them. They have no emotions , they're just carnivours.Let's get to the acting shall we folks. Tom Cruise was great in this, like him or not.As Ray Ferrier, Cruise for his time is able to capture the average working man once again, something he started in movies like ""All the Right moves"". He's not a perfect man, his wife left him, his kids hate him but deep down he loves them, and when the crisis occur there isn't a better father or gjuy than Ray.Dakota Fanning you light up a room with your very presence. This girl is only 11 eleven years old ladies and gentleman, but in her short beginnings she has shown us the talents and skillsof a veteran. She was utterly priceless and lovable as Rachel Ferrier.In a time when former child actors go by the waste side and do nothing, Fanning has emerged as much more than just a kid with a pretty face, she can act with the best of them and she likewise needs to commended for her work.Justin Chatwin as Robbie Ferrier is another memorable character. The rebel who steals his father's car to get away from him. The guy who still is at odds with his dad but when the time comes, the family comes together to get through this crisis and fight for survival!!!You gotta love it how Spielberg, his writers like true master know how to put in the humanity into films like these while at the same delivering us with the big budge special effects we expect to see when we go to the theater, He gives us everything we asked for and then some.Nicely done, Steven, once again, you've given us a classic memorable flick that not only we can enjoy as adults and remember it by but also a great flick that we can take our kids too and as  a family we can be entertained once again by your greatness.""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" then will no doubt be remembered for another masterpiece by Spielberg and everyone involved in the production, making and release of the film should beEXTREMELY proud of themselves.",5,An outstanding masterpiece by Steven Spielberg!!!,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,3314,"['Wow', 'am', 'loss', 'words', 'movie', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Incredible', 'Stupendous', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'sci', 'fi', 'movies', 'ever', 'audience', 'saw', 'thought', 'same', 'gave', 'movie', 'standing', 'ovation', 'Need', 'say', 'more', 'course', '.It', 'based', 'H.G', 'wells', 'classic', 'originally', 'brought', 'life', '1950', 'acclaimed', 'sci', 'fi', 'director', 'George', 'Pal', 'who', 'brought', 'such', 'hits', 'Time', 'Machine', '.Aliens', 'have', 'come', 'invade', 'planet', 'destroy', 'plans', 'are', 'simple', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'Ogilvy', 'extermination', 'people', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'worked', 'such', 'hits', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Willow', 'Terminator', '2', 'Judgement', 'Day', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'commended', 'bringing', 'more', 'top', 'notch', 'award', 'worthy', 'special', 'effecfs', 'screen', 'once', 'agein', 'Spielberg', 'other', 'good', 'directors', 'how', 'input', 'human', 'element', 'heart', 'just', 'done', 'other', 'Blockbusters', 'ET', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', '.In', 'fact', 'felt', 'lot', 'Close', 'many', 'times', 'When', 'strange', 'alien', 'ships', 'emerge', 'great', 'deal', 'human', 'curiousity', 'intrigue', 'then', 'when', 'see', 'Aliens', 'true', 'intentions', 'are', 'disbelief', 'amount', 'destruction', 'can', 'be', 'inflicted', 'one', 'ship.Even', 'Aliens', 'have', 'persoanlity', 'feed', 'food', 'then', 'conquer', 'anything', 'have', 'emotions', ""'re"", 'just', 'carnivours.Let', 'get', 'acting', 'shall', 'folks', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'great', 'not.As', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'Cruise', 'time', 'able', 'capture', 'average', 'working', 'man', 'once', 'again', 'something', 'started', 'movies', 'Right', 'moves', 'not', 'perfect', 'man', 'wife', 'left', 'kids', 'hate', 'deep', 'when', 'crisis', 'occur', ""n't"", 'better', 'father', 'gjuy', 'Ray.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'light', 'up', 'room', 'very', 'presence', 'girl', 'only', '11', 'eleven', 'years', 'old', 'ladies', 'gentleman', 'short', 'beginnings', 'shown', 'talents', 'skillsof', 'veteran', 'was', 'utterly', 'priceless', 'lovable', 'Rachel', 'Ferrier.In', 'time', 'when', 'former', 'child', 'actors', 'go', 'waste', 'side', 'do', 'nothing', 'Fanning', 'emerged', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'kid', 'pretty', 'face', 'can', 'act', 'best', 'likewise', 'commended', 'work.Justin', 'Chatwin', 'Robbie', 'Ferrier', 'memorable', 'character', 'rebel', 'who', 'father', 'car', 'get', 'away', 'guy', 'who', 'still', 'odds', 'dad', 'when', 'time', 'family', 'together', 'get', 'crisis', 'fight', 'survival', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'how', 'Spielberg', 'writers', 'true', 'master', 'know', 'how', 'put', 'humanity', 'films', 'same', 'delivering', 'big', 'budge', 'special', 'effects', 'expect', 'see', 'when', 'go', 'theater', 'everything', 'asked', 'then', 'some.Nicely', 'done', 'Steven', 'once', 'again', ""'ve"", 'given', 'classic', 'memorable', 'flick', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'enjoy', 'adults', 'remember', 'also', 'great', 'flick', 'can', 'take', 'kids', 'too', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'entertained', 'once', 'again', 'greatness', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'then', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'remembered', 'masterpiece', 'Spielberg', 'everyone', 'involved', 'production', 'making', 'release', 'film', 'should', 'beEXTREMELY', 'proud']",N/A

635175,APASOUCF2UD42,B00005JNTI,Greg Curtis,"[3, 7]","The latest adaptation of H.G. Wells' 1898 novel remains faithful to the original story -- opening with the familiar explanation about man's complacency (in a voice-over by Morgan Freeman) -- but this War of the Worlds is an unsettling and dark film, both visually and emotionally.Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, still bitter over his divorce and living in a run-down house beneath a freeway. But without a balding pate and a bulging paunch, it is hard to accept the attractive superstar as a lowbred dock worker. He is father to the most undisciplined, disrespectful and stupid children in cinematic history, Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin). Both characters are extremely unlikeable: Fanning spends more time screaming than Fay Wray in King Kong, while the sullen Chatwin spends every second of his role arguing.While the brief prologue accentuates the humdrum existence of the average American, it quickly advances to the action. The global Holocaust begins with ""lightning"" that knocks out all power and causes ""tremors"" beneath the earth, but it takes the populace a little too long to realize that the enormous tripods rising from the ground are anything but friendly.Josh Friedman's script parlays our fear of the unknown by hiding the identity of the enemy and delaying an explanation of their technology for most of the film. Though the story is similar in plot development to Independence Day, it is without the latter's humour, wit or even optimism. And it's a stretch of the imagination to see the Ferriers miraculously escape from the marauding aliens several times in a row.Director Steven Spielberg has tried to create the ultimate invasion film. The special effects are stunning, and the scenes of mass hysteria and refugees with nowhere to go are truly tragic.War of the Worlds is heart-racing from start to finish, and the horrifying (often gruesome) imagery will linger in your mind. But it contains none of the fantasy and adventure that made Spielberg famous. After his illustrious career, one wonders why he would create such a cynical and unsentimental work.

Wells timeless book `War of the Worlds' has come to the big screen, so it's only natural that a big time American director and Americans movie star take a classic British book and set it modern day New Jersey.Tom Cruise is Ray, a dead beat dad who has his kids for the weekend, his relationship with his children are not that best that they could be. But child-parent relationships soon take a back seat when a bizarre lighting storm strikes. Bizarre in the senses that a series of  lighting strikes hit only one spot.  Ray goes off to investigate and soon comes face to face with a two hundred foot alien tripod rising out of the ground. It's intentions are less then benign when it start atomizing everybody with death rays that render everyone it touches into dust.Ray barely escapes. He rounds up his kids, steals a van and runs for his life,  making a dangerous cross region trek, desperately trying to avoided monstrous, unstoppable killer tripods that vaporize and blast everything that moves.Tom Cruise's trademark toothy grin is notably absent. Replace it is mask of fear, terror and uncertain as he paw through smash neighborhoods and fierily fieldsWhat the movie lacks in faithfulness makes up in atmosphere, the movie's tone is one of complete dread and helplessness and the unknown. We, along with Ray, don't know where the invaders come from, and why they want to exterminate us and every attempt to fight them is met with overwhelming defeat.Like the last time this book was turned into a movie in 1952, it completely through out the original setting in 1890's Victorian England. While the looks of the War Machines are more or less true to the book,  other examples of faithfulness is a scene where Ray and his children take shelter in a basement with a derange man, this is composed of two scene in the book where the narrator meets up with a crazy artillery man and later a preacher, the creeping red weed makes a token appearance.Although lacking in faithfulness to the source material, Spielberg's adaption of the book that invented hostile alien invasion still keeps its audience in dread and suspense until the last few minutes.",4,"Not faithful, but watchable.",1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,2177,"['adaptation', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'timeless', 'book', 'War', 'Worlds', 'come', 'big', 'screen', 'only', 'natural', 'big', 'time', 'American', 'director', 'Americans', 'movie', 'star', 'take', 'classic', 'British', 'book', 'set', 'modern', 'day', 'New', 'Jersey.Tom', 'Cruise', 'Ray', 'dead', 'beat', 'dad', 'who', 'kids', 'weekend', 'relationship', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'child-parent', 'relationships', 'soon', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'when', 'bizarre', 'lighting', 'storm', 'strikes', 'Bizarre', 'senses', 'series', 'lighting', 'strikes', 'hit', 'only', 'one', 'spot', 'Ray', 'investigate', 'soon', 'face', 'face', 'two', 'hundred', 'foot', 'alien', 'tripod', 'rising', 'ground', 'intentions', 'are', 'less', 'then', 'benign', 'when', 'start', 'atomizing', 'everybody', 'death', 'rays', 'render', 'everyone', 'dust.Ray', 'barely', 'up', 'kids', 'steals', 'van', 'life', 'making', 'dangerous', 'cross', 'region', 'trek', 'desperately', 'trying', 'avoided', 'monstrous', 'unstoppable', 'killer', 'tripods', 'vaporize', 'blast', 'everything', 'Cruise', 'trademark', 'toothy', 'grin', 'notably', 'absent', 'Replace', 'mask', 'fear', 'terror', 'uncertain', 'smash', 'neighborhoods', 'fierily', 'fieldsWhat', 'movie', 'faithfulness', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'tone', 'one', 'complete', 'dread', 'helplessness', 'unknown', 'Ray', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'invaders', 'come', 'why', 'want', 'exterminate', 'attempt', 'fight', 'met', 'overwhelming', 'last', 'time', 'book', 'was', 'turned', 'movie', '1952', 'completely', 'out', 'original', 'setting', '1890', 'Victorian', 'England', 'looks', 'War', 'Machines', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'true', 'book', 'other', 'examples', 'faithfulness', 'scene', 'where', 'Ray', 'children', 'take', 'shelter', 'basement', 'derange', 'man', 'composed', 'two', 'scene', 'book', 'where', 'narrator', 'up', 'crazy', 'artillery', 'man', 'later', 'preacher', 'creeping', 'red', 'weed', 'token', 'appearance.Although', 'lacking', 'faithfulness', 'source', 'material', 'Spielberg', 'adaption', 'book', 'invented', 'hostile', 'alien', 'invasion', 'still', 'audience', 'dread', 'suspense', 'last', 'few', 'minutes']",N/A

The down to earth family dynamics contrasts well with Well's sometimes cold and calculated documentation of the near annihilation of Earth. When the father and son squabble over deeply rooted family issues, (son takes pop to task for being a semi-absent father), it is as dramatic and urgent as the monsters dropping from the sky in the backdrop.The film retains the novel's remarkable, future gazing, menacing and mechanical 1898 depictions of aliens from outer space, while never appearing hokey, and looks like a glorified nightmare of doom in the sky in Steven Spielberg's extravagant 21st Century special effects, giving the film both a sci-fi nostalgia and a modern movie appearance.It ends a bit suddenly with an, ""and then they were gone"" resolution, but it's an intense adventure on the way to victory, helped enormously by the talents of Cruise and Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning as his children.

This time, aliens from somewhere further away than ""Europe"" have declared war on Planet Earth, and everything is falling apart, including the bodies and spirits of people: faster than we can imagine.WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE - SAME H.G. WELLS ADAPTATION AS 1953Ray Ferrier [Tom Cruise] plays the everyman type who is forced, out of necessity, to protect his two children against monstrous alien invaders. Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator on the New Jersey docks, and lives nearby. Ferrier is divorced from his wife Mary Ann [Miranda Otto] and has a poor relationship with his two children Rachel and Robbie [Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin]. He sees them during weekend visitations.During one such visitation, he and the kids see a series of strange and violent lighting storms hit the neighborhood. During a brief absence from home, Ray witnessed a fleet of laser-ray tripod spaceships emerging nearby. Fleeing from the scene, literally everything behind Ray was disintegrated as the first wave of the alien invasion began.When he returned home, the film and Ray both shifted gears into turbo-overdrive as Ray desperately attempted to get his kids out-of-Dodge by any means, and to safety. But was there any safety left for him?Ray's desperate task was embodied as the excursion he took his two children on to find safety and their mother. In this film, Ray's epiphany came in the form of becoming the man and father he never was while he was married to his children's mother.Also of interest, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, the leads from the 1953 version of this film, are Ray Ferrier ex in-laws, who are finally seen at the end of the film.*-- PRINCIPAL ACTORS -- *Tom Cruise  - Ray FerrierDakota Fanning  - Rachel FerrierMiranda Otto  - Mary AnnJustin Chatwin  - Robbie FerrierTim Robbins  - OgilvyRick Gonzalez  - VincentYul Vazquez  - JulioLenny Venito  - Manny the MechanicLisa Ann Walter  - BartenderAnn Robinson  - GrandmotherGene Barry  - GrandfatherMorgan Freeman  - Narrator [Voice]ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN VIDEO & AUDIO BUT LIMITED FEATURESThis DVD played and sounded flawless. However, all it had for features, was a brief but interesting featurette about making the monsters for the film. It delved into the idea of turning the story on its head and have the aliens come out of the ground. I wish there was more, alot more.BOTTOM LINE: MORE THAN JUST EYE-CANDY BUT LESS THAN AN EPIC CLASSICTerrific effects, excellent story, but alas, the pacing was just to out-of-this-world fast to allow me time to give a darn about the outcome and what it was I was seeing. Giving the viewpoint of the film to an everyman divorced father with kids, and a mission, was a novel way to play out this material and it was at times quite excellent. Nevertheless, although the film was much more than eye-candy it weighed in as somewhat short of an epic classic.

Hopefully it will make people forget that dreadful Independence Day from nine years ago. Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp bring a unique perspective to the alien invasion genre.

635195,A14Q6R4481YFFG,B00005JNTI,Hinkle Goldfarb,"[2, 4]","A critical review of WOTW (Debra Saunders, The New Republic, July 10) argues that Spielberg is saying ""If aliens invade, don't fight back. Run.""  The reviewer then extrapolates from the movie to the weak-kneed Left that occupies Hollywood and their reaction to the War on Terror.Having now seen the movie myself, I don't think that's a fair assessment, for two reasons.  First, Spielberg was pretty faithful to the book's storyline.  Humans really are massacred and can do nothing but run in the book.  I don't think it's fair to harangue Spielberg for following the book.  But second, and more importantly, I don't think the theme of the movie is ""Run in the face of danger"" so much as: Wouldn't you do *anything* to protect your family?  (The interviews Spielberg gave out just before the premiere of the movie also bear out this angle.)  Cruise's character, Ray Ferrier, after some initial fumbling and hesitation, stops at nothing, absolutely nothing, to protect his family and specifically his daughter.  Well now, if that is Spielberg's message, then cannot we extrapolate from that regarding the WOT, and do anything, absolutely anything, to protect ourselves from the terrorists?  Does not an existential threat merit any and all necessary responses?But enough of the political milieu in which WOTW finds itself in 2005.  The movie itself is pretty good, although I think it could have been cut down by 20 minutes.  Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find the ending to be a downer.  I appreciated the faithfulness to the book.Acting was superb.  Say what you want about Cruise's personal life; he's a heck of an actor.  Dakota Fanning is the best new actress around, turning in a performance that is as good as her performance in last year's ""Man on Fire.""  And she's got a set of lungs that won't quit!  FX was outstanding, as to be expected.  The aliens were a little recycled from ""Close Encounters"" and ""Alien"" but overall were still well-done.Watching the movie I thought the tripods were a rip-off from ""The White Mountains"" trilogy by John Christopher, then I realized that Mr. Christopher wrote his trilogy some 60+ years after H.G. Wells wrote WOTW, so I suppose that Mr. Christopher was the one engaging in the rip-off.  Excuse me, ""homage.""Overall, excellent movie for adults.  Due to the extreme psychological violence of the film, I recommend only for people older than 13.UPDATE:  On July 16 I discovered that David Koepp, who wrote the WOTW screenplay, thinks the Martians represent the American military and the people being slaughtered represent Iraqi civilians.

635199,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B00005JNTI,Ian,"[3, 4]","If there's one thing War of the Worlds does well, its that it shows how one small family copes during a time of great disaster.Adapted from the famous novel of the same name, War of the Worlds revolves around an ordinary guy named Ray, who is a dock worker and a divorcee.  His kids come over to spend some time with him, and wouldn't you know, pesky aliens show up to ruin Ray's day.And ruin it they do.  These aliens are nasty.  They mean buisness.  There's no room for negotiation or surrender here.  They want to conquer earth, and they'll do anything to do so.From the first moment when the tripods rise out of the ground, to a few moments before the end of the movie, there's almost non stop running, things getting blown up, and people being blown up.Spielberg has truely captured the essence of ""End of the world"".Roger Ebert didint like that the movie doesn't explain why the aliens are here, killing or capturing everyone in sight.  But this is intentional.  War of the worlds can be compared to the classic thriller ""Signs"".  The story focuses on one family.  We never cut away from them to see what is happening elsewhere.  We know what they know, and that's it.  And this approach works very well.  At one point a man says ""I heard that a couple of people in Japan killed some"".  People whisper about whats happening, but have no way to confirm whats going on.Along with the tension and suspense, the movie is scary and creepy.  People explode right in front of our eyes, turning into dust upon being hit with the tripod's death rays.  People are trapped in cars that sink into a river, screaming for help.  Screaming people are snatched up by the aliens, carried off for who knows what.  One of the scariest moments is when a poor guy is sucked into a walker through a hole, as if he's being eaten alive.  And what's even scarier is that we don't know what happens to him (But with all the red mist being sprayed out, we know it's not good).But the scariest moment in the movie doesnt involve aliens.  It involves people.  It involves Ray and his family driving a car, while surrounded by hundreds of desperate (and possibly mad) people who will do ANYTHING for a ride.  That sequence scared me, especially when the bullets started flying.The aliens and thier machinery are pulled off flawlessly.  The tripods are gigantic and truely threatening.  The blasting sound they emit is even creepier.  The carnage they can inflict is incredible.  Buildings explode, trees burn, and huge amounts of debris fly everywhere.  All with flawless special effects.  Everything looks real.  Nothing looks fake.  Even the aliens themselves look incredible.The only problem with the movie is the last seven minutes or so.  It's pretty anti-clamatic.  A film like this BEGS for an ending where everything is absoloutly hopeless until the last possible second, when things turn around.To explain my point, I have to reveal what happens, so if you want to stay spoiler free, don't look!*As Ray and his daughter are coming into Boston at the end of the movie, the aliens are already dying, and are pretty much goners.  They fall down, die, end of movie.  I think it could have been much better if when Ray and his daughter reached Bostan and were desperatly trying to reach the moms house while the tripods were destroying everything around them.  The military would be desperatly fighting the tripods, but loosing.  Just as they reach the house, and are about to be destroyed, the tripods start falling over, and the aliens die.  End of movie*Basically, the ending could use more polish and work.  While the classic ending is in place, it just needs a little more work.But in the end, War of the Worlds is a great summer movie that's smart and thrilling.

There are some really clever scenes, such as when the alien is searching every last inch of the basement in which Tom, Dakota and Tim Robbins are hiding.  Obviously, the aliens can hear as well as see.  After the machine checks the basement, creatures are also sent in to double-check.  Tim Robbins starts to have a nervous breakdown and wants to shoot the creatures, which would only bring more creatures and they would be caught for sure.

It creates a genuine feel of terror with running away from giant alien tripods that are turning people in ash and basically popping them. it gives off a GREAT ""there is no escape"" feel. i think the reason being is that in Wells' original novel, the alien tripods didnt fly - they just weren't that advanced. instead, they walked along the ground, crushing everything in their path. this gives the invasion a more ""closer to home"" sensation and it makes the invasion seems much more invasive. this is what the last movie version of this story didn't do, probably for reasons associated wit special effects limitations at the time. it was indeed much easier to make a hovering alien craft than it was to make a fully animated alien tripod....parents of small children beware - while i think this is a classic story every generation hould be familiar with, i must make at least some mention that, this being NOT related in any way to the now-cheesy 1960s version of the movie, this version is indeed very intense. the people getting turned into ash by the alien beams is often very clear, and very realistic. its not easy  in the least to give me the willies, but for some reason, looking right into someone's crying, weeping face before they get vaporized was pretty unsettling. i suppose its because thats such a.... foreign thing to see. we're used to seeing people get bashed, bloodied, and mutilated, but this is nothing like that. its so instant and ""there one second, gone the next"", that it kinda shocks your mind a little bit :-P - but man its a really neat effect!!!all in all, this is an AWESOME depiction of Wells' story, with a few little changes here and there, but for the most part it holds to Wells' original imaginings to a remarkably close degree.oh and to Ting - the reviewer right before me - the seeming loose end in the movie was not made so obvious as much as the book, so i cant blame you for not getting it.in essense, the aliens die because the become sick with all of our bacteria and viruses - they breathe our air, drink our water,  etc. etc. - they end up becoming contaminated, which is something i guess they weren't anticipating. but it disorients them and ultimately they die of the illness.",5,i saw this today and thought it was EXCELLENT,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,2565,"['best', 'version', 'classic', 'story', 'date', 'what', 'i', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'atmosphere', 'portryaed', ""n't"", 'Indenpendence', 'Day', 'Signs', 'classic', 'true', 'heart', 'alien', 'invasion', 'straight', '40', '50', 'complete', 'grungy', 'atmosphere', 'old-fashioned', 'martians', '-with-ray-guns', 'scenario', 'genuine', 'feel', 'terror', 'running', 'away', 'giant', 'alien', 'tripods', 'are', 'turning', 'people', 'ash', 'basically', 'popping', 'GREAT', 'escape', 'feel', 'i', 'think', 'reason', 'being', 'Wells', 'original', 'novel', 'alien', 'tripods', 'didnt', 'fly', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'advanced', 'instead', 'walked', 'ground', 'crushing', 'everything', 'path', 'invasion', 'more', 'closer', 'home', 'sensation', 'invasion', 'much', 'more', 'invasive', 'what', 'last', 'movie', 'version', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'probably', 'reasons', 'associated', 'wit', 'special', 'effects', 'limitations', 'time', 'was', 'indeed', 'much', 'easier', 'make', 'hovering', 'alien', 'craft', 'was', 'make', 'fully', 'animated', 'alien', 'tripod', '.parents', 'small', 'children', 'beware', 'i', 'think', 'classic', 'story', 'generation', 'hould', 'be', 'familiar', 'i', 'must', 'make', 'least', 'mention', 'being', 'NOT', 'related', 'way', 'now-cheesy', '1960s', 'version', 'movie', 'version', 'indeed', 'very', 'intense', 'people', 'getting', 'turned', 'ash', 'alien', 'beams', 'often', 'very', 'clear', 'very', 'realistic', 'not', 'easy', 'least', 'give', 'willies', 'reason', 'looking', 'right', 'someone', 'crying', 'weeping', 'face', 'get', 'vaporized', 'was', 'pretty', 'unsettling', 'i', 'suppose', 'thats', 'such', 'foreign', 'thing', 'see', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'people', 'get', 'bashed', 'bloodied', 'mutilated', 'nothing', 'so', 'instant', 'one', 'second', 'gone', 'next', 'shocks', 'mind', 'little', 'bit', '-P', 'man', 'really', 'neat', 'effect', 'AWESOME', 'depiction', 'Wells', 'story', 'few', 'little', 'changes', 'here', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'Wells', 'original', 'imaginings', 'remarkably', 'close', 'degree.oh', 'Ting', 'reviewer', 'right', 'seeming', 'loose', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'so', 'obvious', 'as', 'much', 'book', 'i', 'cant', 'blame', 'not', 'getting', 'it.in', 'essense', 'aliens', 'die', 'become', 'sick', 'bacteria', 'viruses', 'breathe', 'air', 'drink', 'water', 'etc', 'etc', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'contaminated', 'something', 'i', 'guess', 'were', ""n't"", 'anticipating', 'ultimately', 'die', 'illness']",N/A

Stephen King's Tommyknockers are a hundred times better than this film. H.G. Wells's book was not particularly good, but the film does not improve the stuff. Apart from Orson Welles and his radio show that caused a panick in his days, this book has not inspired anything worth while. Too many special effects. Tom Cruise is absolutely well-shaved from beginning to end. They walk the distance from the other side of New York to Boston in hardly two days. Tom Cruise is swallowed by the monster and retrieved by simple human leg-pulling leaving two hand grenades inside. Someone must be pulling my leg, and even my two legs. Apart from showing the good armed forces protecting America and simple people, I don't see any meaning in the film. Is there anything subliminal or metaphorical ? Maybe, but all hypotheses are far-fetched. Don't invade any country. It always leads to a catastrophe like in Afghanistan and Iraq. Banal and simple-minded. America is invincible. Sure and remember Vietnam or the helicopters grounded in the desert on their way to Tehran twenty years ago. Humanity is absolutely protected by nature. Let me laugh though it is pathetic. Think of AIDS and Chicken Flu. And we can destroy ourselves better than any extra-terrestrial. Remember our beautiful nuclear power stations that melt down into a nice atomic BBQ, and we are the hamburgers. If all super-intelligent extra-terrestrials are so dumb that they do not check the air for any little invisible things that could be dangerous for their health, we do not run any risk indeed. If Americans can build skyscrapers on top of buried enormous machines without finding them, then we do run a risk. Are Steven Spielberg or Tom Cruise that hungry that they accept to shoot a film of that poor quality ? I don't believe it.

635214,A39VJRIW7HC5C0,B00005JNTI,James Kunz,"[3, 8]","Although perhaps we should expect more from Steven Spielberg, War of the Worlds functions well as a summer blockbuster and is certainly worth the price of admission.  The plot is not terribly complex --oddly enough the movie ultimately takes the form of a road picture (people travelling from point A to point B, meeting interesting people/situations along the way)-- with Tom Cruise attempting to lead his two children from his New Jersey home to Boston during an alien invasion.  After some character development, alien tripods rise up from the streets and begin raining terror upon humans.The film should be commended for focusing on two things: one family's attempt to survive in the carnage as opposed to the US vs. Aliens approach taken by Independance Day, and the darker side of human nature when the chips are down.  By viewing the film through the lens of the former, a palpable sense of confusion is always present.  Though some information is filled in to the main character by way of a news reporter, at no point do we know what is happening elsewhere in the world (indeed, various characters speak of things happening across the oceans, and their reports directly contradict each other), or even in other parts of the United States.  Through this tactic the movie keeps the audience's focus solely on its characters.  As to the latter, the darker side of human nature, it is here that the movie makes its mark.  Scenes of a mob fighting over a bruised minivan are brilliant, as are the scenes when desperate people scramble to get onto a loaded ferry.  Tim Robbins turn as a twisted survivalist add to this motif, as does the conclusion to his relationship with the main character.On a technical scale, this movie ranks quite high, and certainly near the level we have come to expect from a summer blockbuster.  The sound is also very good, from a solid score from John Williams to the wonderful noises the tripods make.  The acting was also solid, and Spielburg's direction very satisfactory.  My problems with the film were more thematic-based, especially when it comes to the film's conclusion.  Not only was the ending too upbeat and not in keeping at all with the rest of the film, but it came as a complete anti-climax- one feels that the story is only at its midpoint when it fact it has reached its zenith.  I would also complain about the deus ex machina aspects to the aliens' demise, but from all accounts the book ended the same way so I suppose I wouldn't have much of a point.Though the conclusion is normally one of the most important parts of a film and this one's ending left a severely bad taste in my mouth, the good parts of the film outweigh the bad and a good rating is deserved.  ***/4",4,"Flawed, but its strengths overcome its weaknesses",1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,2722,"['perhaps', 'should', 'expect', 'more', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'functions', 'well', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'certainly', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'plot', 'not', 'terribly', 'complex', 'oddly', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'form', 'road', 'picture', 'people', 'travelling', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'meeting', 'interesting', 'people/situations', 'way', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'attempting', 'lead', 'two', 'children', 'New', 'Jersey', 'home', 'Boston', 'alien', 'invasion', 'character', 'development', 'alien', 'tripods', 'rise', 'up', 'streets', 'begin', 'raining', 'terror', 'humans.The', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'focusing', 'two', 'things', 'one', 'family', 'attempt', 'survive', 'carnage', 'opposed', 'US', 'vs.', 'Aliens', 'approach', 'taken', 'Independance', 'Day', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'viewing', 'film', 'lens', 'former', 'palpable', 'sense', 'confusion', 'always', 'present', 'information', 'filled', 'main', 'character', 'way', 'news', 'reporter', 'point', 'do', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'elsewhere', 'world', 'indeed', 'various', 'characters', 'speak', 'things', 'happening', 'oceans', 'reports', 'directly', 'contradict', 'other', 'even', 'other', 'parts', 'United', 'States', 'tactic', 'movie', 'audience', 'focus', 'solely', 'characters', 'latter', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'here', 'movie', 'mark', 'Scenes', 'mob', 'fighting', 'bruised', 'minivan', 'are', 'brilliant', 'are', 'scenes', 'when', 'desperate', 'people', 'scramble', 'get', 'loaded', 'ferry', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'turn', 'twisted', 'survivalist', 'add', 'motif', 'conclusion', 'relationship', 'main', 'character.On', 'technical', 'scale', 'movie', 'quite', 'high', 'certainly', 'level', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'sound', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'solid', 'score', 'John', 'Williams', 'wonderful', 'tripods', 'make', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'solid', 'Spielburg', 'direction', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'problems', 'film', 'were', 'more', 'thematic-based', 'especially', 'when', 'film', 'conclusion', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'ending', 'too', 'upbeat', 'not', 'keeping', 'rest', 'film', 'came', 'complete', 'anti-climax-', 'one', 'story', 'only', 'midpoint', 'when', 'fact', 'reached', 'zenith', 'would', 'also', 'complain', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'aspects', 'aliens', 'demise', 'accounts', 'book', 'ended', 'same', 'way', 'suppose', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'point.Though', 'conclusion', 'normally', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'parts', 'film', 'one', 'ending', 'left', 'severely', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'good', 'parts', 'film', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'good', 'rating', 'deserved', '***/4']",N/A

Wells' ""War of the Worlds"" was a novel published in 1898.On October 30, 1938, Orson Welles presented LIVE on ""The Mercury Theatre On The Air"" on CBS Radio, ""The War Of The Worlds"".  It began as a music program until a news bulletin broke in that their was something that landed at Grover's Mill, New Jersey.  Was it the beginning of a war? Was it indeed a Martian invasion?.  1938 was a sensitive year for people and those that did tune in to the radio broadcast were in shock all over America. They panicked and some even called CBS Radio in fright. *Remember, their was no invention of television sets yet?*  Orson Welles later apoligized and reminded the radio listeners it was only ""Mercury Theatre On The Air"" with another radio broadcast.  It was just meant to be a Halloween ""boo"".In 1975, they actually made an all-star television movie, ""THE NIGHT THAT PANICKED AMERICA"" (1975-tv), based upon the real, actual events that happened on that night of October 30, 1938 when their was a mass panick across America.  This movie currently is not available on VHS or DVD.In 1953, they made a motion picture,  ""THE WAR OF THE WORLDS"",starring Gene Barry and Ann Robinson. Produced by George Pal with unforgettable Academy Award winning special effects.This 1953 film version is still the best version of all ""War of the Worlds"" films.The radio broadcast is available in ""Special Features"" on a new DVD release, a ""Special Collecter's Edition"" of the 1953 film version.  The radio broadcast is also available from Amazon.com and in the ""Complete & Unedited"" version from ""Radio Spirits"".Their was a ""War Of The Worlds"" tv series in 1988-90.In 2005, three new ""War Of The Worlds"" films were released.""War Of The Worlds"" was released straight-to-DVD on June 14, 2005. Directed by Timothy Pines. Starring Anthony Piana and Jack Clay.  It is considered to be the first authentic movie adaptation from the H.G. Wells' novel of 1898.Another straight-to-DVD version, ""H.G. Wells' WAR OF THE WORLDS"", starring C. Thomas Howell and Rhett Giles was released on DVD, June 28, 2005.  It was broadcast on the SCI-FI channel, January 14, 2006.The latest version is the worst version ever to be released in theatres. Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005) starring Tom Cruise.  The alien ship looks like part of a vaccuum cleaner with lead pipes.  It even makes a sound like the mothership in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977/1980). Some scenes might remind you of JAWS (1975) or POLTERGEIST (1982). Instead of having a terrified girlfriend, Steven Spielberg chose to add a frightened little girl to be dragged around by Tom Cruise and he curses at her too.

PlotI think a lot of people are forgetting this is a remake and not an original movie. On the other hand, mabey people ""expect"" Steven Speilberg to do it totally different and ""update it"" for ""our times"". However... fact is, the movie was silly when it first came out, this version is just as silly.It's more of the same, except this time the Aliens are coming from underground in thier big tripods'o'doom instead of flying around in spaceships. Instead of focusing on the action though... the main characters, as you know by now are the family of 3, led bvy Tom Cruise. Basically it makes the film a lot like ""Signs"", lots of ""family hiding out from the big bad aliens"".2. ScienceYeah once again it's silly. But hey... still a good popcorn movie. Aliens travelling down lightning rods into the ground, tripods'o'doom laying undetected and in perfect working order after sitting dormant underground for a very very long time, And then there's the ending...3. Ending (Don't read this part if you've watched the original or want the ending spoiled).I saw a lot of people grizzled in other reviews regarding the ending. Saying stuff like ""it's stupid"", or ""this won't make it a classic"" or ""what a copout"". The ending is exactly the same as the original film. Take that as you will. I liked the ending... albiet somewhat unexciting, implausable and superficial. You gotta figure that an alien intelligence that can master interstellar travel... is smart enough to know about the very thing that ""is thier undoing"" in this film. Well... HG Wells ignored it in the original movie, and Speilberg ignored it in the remake. Hey... it's just a movie.4. The acting'N'characters'N'stuff.All good. Good job by Tom Cruise as always. Biggest gripe was the Dakota Fanning character, aka terrified 10 year old girl. I suppose Speilberg was going for a bit of realism here being that Tom Cruise's character has to calm down his terrifed 10 year old daughter every 10 minutes in the movie. It's things like this that annoy the viewer and slow the film down. Then again, I guess we need a bit of filler material between the loud bellows of the tripods'o'doom and people getting blasted to obblivion from thier death rays.",3,"Good popcorn movie, on a par with the original",1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,2330,"[""'ll"", 'address', 'specific', 'issues', 'movie', 'format', 'review', 'are', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'review.1', 'PlotI', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'forgetting', 'remake', 'not', 'original', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'mabey', 'people', 'expect', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'do', 'totally', 'different', 'update', 'times', 'However', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'silly', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'version', 'just', 'silly.It', 'more', 'same', 'time', 'Aliens', 'are', 'coming', 'underground', 'thier', 'big', 'tripods', ""o'doom"", 'instead', 'flying', 'around', 'spaceships', 'Instead', 'focusing', 'action', 'main', 'characters', 'know', 'now', 'are', 'family', '3', 'led', 'bvy', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Basically', 'film', 'lot', 'Signs', 'lots', 'family', 'hiding', 'out', 'big', 'bad', 'aliens', '.2', 'ScienceYeah', 'once', 'again', 'silly', 'hey', 'still', 'good', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'travelling', 'down', 'lightning', 'rods', 'ground', 'tripods', ""o'doom"", 'laying', 'undetected', 'perfect', 'working', 'order', 'sitting', 'dormant', 'underground', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'then', 'ending', '3', 'Ending', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'part', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'original', 'want', 'ending', 'spoiled', '.I', 'saw', 'lot', 'people', 'grizzled', 'other', 'reviews', 'regarding', 'ending', 'Saying', 'stuff', 'stupid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'classic', 'what', 'copout', 'ending', 'exactly', 'same', 'original', 'film', 'Take', 'will', 'liked', 'ending', 'albiet', 'somewhat', 'unexciting', 'implausable', 'superficial', 'got', 'ta', 'figure', 'alien', 'intelligence', 'can', 'master', 'interstellar', 'travel', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'very', 'thing', 'thier', 'undoing', 'film', 'Well', 'HG', 'Wells', 'ignored', 'original', 'movie', 'Speilberg', 'ignored', 'remake', 'Hey', 'just', 'movie.4', 'acting', ""N'characters"", ""N'stuff.All"", 'good', 'Good', 'job', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'always', 'Biggest', 'gripe', 'was', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'character', 'aka', 'terrified', '10', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'suppose', 'Speilberg', 'was', 'going', 'bit', 'realism', 'here', 'being', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'calm', 'down', 'terrifed', '10', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'things', 'viewer', 'slow', 'film', 'down', 'Then', 'again', 'guess', 'need', 'bit', 'filler', 'material', 'loud', 'bellows', 'tripods', ""o'doom"", 'people', 'getting', 'blasted', 'obblivion', 'thier', 'death', 'rays']",N/A

As I suspected the movie was thrilling from the first moment to the conclusion. A pet peeve of mine was when Spielberg totally did a great job of continuity with having all of the electronic devices rendered useless after an electro-magnetic pulse surge, he so wanted one shot so badly that he allowed someone's video camera to somehow in some miracle still work so that he could show off some whiz-bang gnarly effect.

Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) plays a stevedore who returns home one day to greet his estranged wife, her new husband, his rebellious teenage son, a banshee-screaming daughter and invading Martians. Despite the explosive eruption, colossal growth, murderous rampage and vaporous populous, Ray reacts curiously as beings from Mars emerge to, destroy his city and systematically set out to conquer the world. Inhibiting clear thinking is his protective attitude, his chiding son who lambaste his father for personal failures, and his terrified daughter who's irritating screams prevent planning and implementation. The movie attempts to bring to life the classic novel by H. G. Wells and in many ways succeeds. However, Spielberg spent so much time on the bickering family, that he left the audience straining to see the cataclysmic confrontation between Earth's forces and the gigantic Tri-pod Martains, over the shoulders of Cruise and his problems. The original 1957 version had Gene Barry as a scientist and the audience easily followed him. In this version, Cruise is a common man who's innate curiosity becomes a hindrance. In addition, the great talent of Tim Robbins is wasted as a crazed survivor. In conclusion, the original had direction, the new version is hampered with family ties.

One of my favorite big Hollywood movies was 'Independence Day' (i know, my credibility is totally shot now) and I found myself constantly comparing the two movies. They are quite similiar. ""War of the Worlds' was decent, 'Independence Day' was big, stupid, incredible fun.I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he is fine here. I will admit some of his movies are a guilty pleasure (Cocktail, Top Gun, Few Good Men....) and I guess I know have to add this movie to that list. Now I know the man can act, he was sensational in Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July, but sometimes he just does not have 'it'...you know what I mean? The adorable Dakota Fanning continues to amaze, this little lady is going to become one hell of an actress, if she hasn't already. Although her performance does not rival her superb display in 'Man on Fire' she still gets the job done big time in what I feel was a very demanding role. The same can not be said for the kid who plays Cruise's son, Robby. Very bland and whiny, I was actually happy when he separated himself from Cruise and Fanning.Now, the true stars of the film........the special effects, wow, they are spectacular. You talk about intense, bright, loud, scary....just expertly crafted, Spielberg always delivers the goods when it comes to special effects and this just continues his amazing achievements. The tri-pods are a stunning sight to see, the aliens are scary as hell, and for a PG-13 movie, this gets pretty violent when they show the way the tri-pods, um, ""process"" the humans. I still feel the special effects in 'Independence Day' are the best I've ever seen, but this movie has nothing to be ashamed off, as the effects here will blow you away.Tim Robbins role in this I feel was a waste, why can't the heroes take shelter or team up with a normal sane person? why does it always have to be an on-edge, unbalanced, borderline psychotic?Don't get me wrong, Robbins acting is fine, as it usually is, but  it's just one of those Hollywood cliches' that I guess I'm just really gettin' tired of. The whole scene with Cruise making Dakota close her eyes and plug her ears while he goes and ""takes care of"" Robbins I felt was a total waste and accomplished nothing. But it picks up well after that and leads to a pretty cool conclusion that was not over-done but fit well.acting.........3 stars, Dakota is great, Cruise ok, rest not so gooddirecting.......3.5 stars, Definitely not his best, but topping Schindler's List or Jurassic Park would be a huge feat.special effects.....4.5 Wow, just.........wowaction rating.....4 stars, Pretty suspensefull, boat scene is harrowing.quality...........4 stars, We are talking about Spielberg here",3,Special Effects rule the day.....................,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2963,"['Not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'went', 'doing', 'best', 'hate', 'am', 'so', 'sick', 'remakes', 'alas', 'really', 'hard', 'hate', 'anything', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'man', 'obviously', 'gift', 'big', 'Hollwood', 'movies', 'trend', 'here', 'One', 'favorite', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'was', ""'Independence"", 'Day', 'i', 'know', 'credibility', 'totally', 'shot', 'now', 'found', 'constantly', 'comparing', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'quite', 'similiar', 'War', 'Worlds', 'was', 'decent', ""'Independence"", 'Day', 'was', 'big', 'stupid', 'incredible', 'fun.I', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'fan', 'fine', 'here', 'will', 'admit', 'movies', 'are', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Cocktail', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'guess', 'know', 'have', 'add', 'movie', 'list', 'Now', 'know', 'man', 'can', 'act', 'was', 'sensational', 'Rain', 'Man', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'sometimes', 'just', 'not', 'have', ""'it"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'adorable', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'amaze', 'little', 'lady', 'going', 'become', 'one', 'hell', 'actress', ""n't"", 'already', 'performance', 'not', 'rival', 'superb', 'display', ""'Man"", 'Fire', 'still', 'job', 'done', 'big', 'time', 'what', 'feel', 'was', 'very', 'demanding', 'role', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'kid', 'who', 'Cruise', 'son', 'Robby', 'Very', 'bland', 'whiny', 'was', 'actually', 'happy', 'when', 'separated', 'Cruise', 'Fanning.Now', 'true', 'stars', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'wow', 'are', 'spectacular', 'talk', 'intense', 'bright', 'loud', 'scary', '.just', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'Spielberg', 'always', 'goods', 'when', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'amazing', 'achievements', 'tri-pods', 'are', 'stunning', 'sight', 'see', 'aliens', 'are', 'scary', 'hell', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'pretty', 'violent', 'when', 'show', 'way', 'tri-pods', 'um', 'process', 'humans', 'still', 'feel', 'special', 'effects', ""'Independence"", 'Day', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed', 'off', 'effects', 'here', 'will', 'blow', 'away.Tim', 'Robbins', 'role', 'feel', 'was', 'waste', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'heroes', 'take', 'shelter', 'team', 'up', 'normal', 'sane', 'person', 'why', 'always', 'have', 'be', 'on-edge', 'unbalanced', 'borderline', 'psychotic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Robbins', 'acting', 'fine', 'usually', 'just', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'really', 'gettin', 'tired', 'whole', 'scene', 'Cruise', 'making', 'Dakota', 'close', 'eyes', 'plug', 'ears', 'care', 'Robbins', 'felt', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'accomplished', 'nothing', 'up', 'well', 'pretty', 'cool', 'conclusion', 'was', 'not', 'over-done', 'fit', 'well.acting', '3', 'stars', 'Dakota', 'great', 'Cruise', 'ok', 'rest', 'not', 'so', 'gooddirecting', '.3.5', 'stars', 'Definitely', 'not', 'best', 'topping', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'feat.special', 'effects', '..4.5', 'Wow', 'just', 'wowaction', 'rating', '..4', 'stars', 'Pretty', 'suspensefull', 'boat', 'scene', 'harrowing.quality', '..4', 'stars', 'are', 'talking', 'Spielberg', 'here']",N/A
635225,AGT3P9GVVB0XT,B00005JNTI,Jay Stevens,"[4, 8]","What is Spielberg's most forgettable movie? It's not ""1941,"" which, if you've seen it, is impossible to forget, even if you try to scratch out the memory from your brain with your fingernails.It's ""War of the Worlds."" Heck, I barely remember enough about it to write this review.Look, there's enough mayhem and special effects to get your blood pumping, and there's the usual Spielbergian tension-setting, the creatures that prowl just inches from our protagonists, the wild crowd effects as alien tripods zap pedestrians into dust, etc and company. The acting is decent - or Cruise is, anyway. (The children - Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning - are pretty annoying, but then they're not handed much in the way of a script. Fanning screams a lot, Chatwin sulks then disappears for half the movie.) But we've seen this before. We've been ""dazzled"" and ""thrilled.""But let's face it. There's nothing to this movie. Nothing. Spielberg's focusing on a family in crisis quickly grows absurd - like in the opening scene when we're expected to be interested by Cruise's Ray Ferrier, a big-time loser jerk obsessed with big machines. (And did anyone else notice Cruise's chubby, girlish thighs?) The plot goes haywire - the end sucks, as everyone has pointed out - but nothing else fits together. Ferrier operates a crane during the opening credits. Why? He's good with engines. So? But the worst crime of all: Ray Ferrier and family have nothing to do with the outcome of the main drama. So why follow them? Why do we care?And then Spielberg makes an attempt to tie in 9/11 to the movie. In the opening attack scene, a crowd of New Yorkers runs panicked through a cloud of dust as mysterious, faceless beings engineer the destruction of their city. You've seen the pictures from the real deal. The movie scene left me cold. Spielberg evokes 9/11 for...entertainment? To give us a few thrills? To scare us? All it did was remind me I was at a movie and that real life is scarier and people are were getting shot and blown up as I was watching the flick. Worse still, Spielberg fails to follow up on the allegory. If the alien invasion was 9/11...then...what's the rest of the movie? There doesn't seem be a coherent political or allegorical message, other than it stinks to be in the National Guard. So why bring up 9/11? Hasn't it been used enough to evoke emotion or patriotic fervor? Let's do something meaningful with that day for a change!Enough of the rant. It wasn't a bad movie.

I've been reading reviews, a lot of them were positive and I was ready.As soon as the opening credits rolled up I was ready for a wild ride after seeing the excellent Batman Begins.And I wasn't disappointed. This movie was awesome.WE heard the plot before. Alien machines attack the Earth. But it's presented perfectly. But the movie is also focused on Ray and his 2 kids, a 12 year old girl who asks too many questions ( 'Is it terrorists?/ Is he okay? Are you Okay?/ Are we still alive?) and a troubled teenager who listens to rock music.The movie feels like Post 911 movie, filled with slaughtering humans, tripods sucking blood out of people, and a lot of explosions. The movie is very dark and powerful at some parts. I even felt for these characters because it felt real. We don't have a hero trying to fight aliens. Instead, he flees from the aliens because they're too big and have powerful heat-rays.And the special effects... WOW!!! Those were great special effcts. The tripods, the aliens, even those heat-rays that vaporized the towns-folk. Well done, Speilberg. Well done. There were also some homages to the original. The was the attack, the eye-snake, the aliens in the house (though, in the original, there was only one), the eye-snake looking at the character, the eye-snake gets chopped by an axe and the the alien's hand coming out of the machine dying. Those were al fantastic homages and should be seen to those who seen the original.Overall, this movie is a fantasic and exciting adventure.

""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" ""King Kong,"" to name a few, are ultimately about the people in them.Spielberg's greatest strength, in the past, has been as a master storyteller.  Whether it was facing a maneating monster shark in ""Jaws"" or aliens in ""Close Encounters..."" or the halocaust in ""Schindler's List,"" Spielberg has helped create memorable characters and it was ultimately about them that you cared.Not here.  There is noone really of note here, perhaps except for Dakota Fanning.  You certainly don't really care about Ray, played by Tom Cruise.  You don't believe him as a blue collar guy, particularly with such a stunning set of teeth.  Why not cast someone like Paul Giamatti in a role like this?You certainly don't understand the animosity his estranged wife has for him, turning particularly their eldest son against him.  It doesn't make her sympathetic, and Tom Cruise's character, while not evil, is not particularly likeable either.  There just aren't really characters you care about here.

Great family story, incredible CGI work, terrific premise about Martian invaders preparing the Earth or millennia before pulling the trigger. There were great Boston-v.-NYC visual gags, very funny here in the post-Red-Sox-World-Series-victory Boston area. Not to mention terrific acting on the part of Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin, who played his children Rachel and Robbie. It was inspired to burden Cruise with a surly, distracted teenager and a screaming panic-prone young girl when the world was about to end. The kids limited Cruise's optin in ways that were believable and sympathetic. The possibilities were limitless.The story, for those just emerging from spell in a cryogenic tank, concerns the invasion of Earth by a vastly-superior Martian force. Seemingly, nothing can stand between the invaders and the imminent annihilation of humanity. Director Steven Spielberg uses his genius to represent large forces by way of heir small effects: A string of flaming army trucks rolling driverless from the scene of an attack signals expertly the carnage that is promised for any earthly power sent against the aliens. The tale is told from the perspective of Ray Ferrier, divorced, uneducated and irresponsible, who must care for his to children for weekend as his remarried (and now pregnant) wife and new hubby head to Boston for the weekend. As soon as the new couple's SUV heads out of town, the aliens make their first bewildering appearance.I have to give Spielberg credit for using an unusual approach to a film about alien invaders. Usually, there's an all-knowing scientist around to explain the other-worldly phenomena. In this film, Cruise and his neighbors are on their own as they try to understand the crazy weather and seismic activity occurring in their neighborhood. While initially this is a great idea (most of us don't have access to a friendly scientist) Speilberg isn't able to make it work. It's one thing to leave the film's characters in he dark, but it's unforgivable to leave the filmgoer there too.(BARELY DISGUISED SPOILERS AHEAD) By the second half of the movie, there are so many mysterious things going on that the film is propelled solely by its own inertia. Cruise and family are taken in by a half-mad stranger, and cower in his basement (a la ""Signs"") for least a quarter of the film. Meanwhile the aliens are running around outside inexplicably sucking the life out of captured humans, and spreading weird red tentacles all over the landscape. If Spielberg intends us to say ""Oh, so that's why Mars is red!"" he conveniently forgets that we have already sent rovers to Mars and know that their soil is made of red sand - not blood vessels veining across the surface. It's this sort of intelligence-insulting approach that ultimately dooms TWOTW to cinematic mediocrity. If Spielberg had had one of the alien ships spit out little Sojourner, NASA's Mars rover, it would have been both funny, frightening and signaled that Spilberg respected our intelligence. But being either too lazy, indifferent or caught up in special effects, Spielberg neglects to add the small touches that would have made TWOTW a standout.WOTW could have been a terrific summer movie. Its strong start and more than a few incredible ideas and visuals indicate what could have been. But to judge from the ongoing discussions in my household, it is riddled with so many plot holes, mysteries and inconsistencies that its believability is a sapped as the corpses of the humans the Martians ""farmed"".With so many films under his belt, Spielberg should realize that ""it's the story, stupid"" and let his effects serve the plot, rather than the other way round.",3,Warts Of The World,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,3745,"['first', 'half', 'War', 'Worlds', 'was', 'astounding', 'Great', 'family', 'story', 'incredible', 'CGI', 'work', 'terrific', 'premise', 'Martian', 'invaders', 'preparing', 'Earth', 'millennia', 'pulling', 'trigger', 'were', 'great', 'Boston-v.-NYC', 'visual', 'gags', 'very', 'funny', 'here', 'post-Red-Sox-World-Series-victory', 'Boston', 'area', 'Not', 'mention', 'terrific', 'acting', 'part', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'who', 'played', 'children', 'Rachel', 'Robbie', 'was', 'inspired', 'burden', 'Cruise', 'surly', 'distracted', 'teenager', 'screaming', 'panic-prone', 'young', 'girl', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'end', 'kids', 'limited', 'Cruise', 'optin', 'ways', 'were', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'possibilities', 'were', 'limitless.The', 'story', 'just', 'emerging', 'spell', 'cryogenic', 'tank', 'invasion', 'Earth', 'vastly-superior', 'Martian', 'force', 'Seemingly', 'nothing', 'can', 'stand', 'invaders', 'imminent', 'annihilation', 'humanity', 'Director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'genius', 'represent', 'large', 'forces', 'way', 'heir', 'small', 'effects', 'string', 'flaming', 'army', 'trucks', 'rolling', 'driverless', 'scene', 'attack', 'signals', 'expertly', 'carnage', 'promised', 'earthly', 'power', 'sent', 'aliens', 'tale', 'told', 'perspective', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'divorced', 'uneducated', 'irresponsible', 'who', 'must', 'care', 'children', 'weekend', 'remarried', 'now', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'new', 'hubby', 'head', 'Boston', 'weekend', 'As', 'soon', 'new', 'couple', 'SUV', 'town', 'aliens', 'make', 'first', 'bewildering', 'appearance.I', 'have', 'give', 'Spielberg', 'credit', 'using', 'unusual', 'approach', 'film', 'alien', 'invaders', 'Usually', 'all-knowing', 'scientist', 'explain', 'other-worldly', 'phenomena', 'film', 'Cruise', 'neighbors', 'are', 'own', 'try', 'understand', 'crazy', 'weather', 'seismic', 'activity', 'occurring', 'neighborhood', 'initially', 'great', 'idea', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'access', 'friendly', 'scientist', 'Speilberg', ""n't"", 'able', 'make', 'work', 'one', 'thing', 'leave', 'film', 'characters', 'dark', 'unforgivable', 'leave', 'filmgoer', 'there', 'too', 'BARELY', 'DISGUISED', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'mysterious', 'things', 'going', 'film', 'propelled', 'solely', 'own', 'inertia', 'Cruise', 'family', 'are', 'taken', 'half-mad', 'stranger', 'cower', 'basement', 'la', 'Signs', 'least', 'quarter', 'film', 'Meanwhile', 'aliens', 'are', 'running', 'around', 'inexplicably', 'sucking', 'life', 'captured', 'humans', 'spreading', 'weird', 'red', 'tentacles', 'landscape', 'Spielberg', 'say', 'Oh', 'why', 'Mars', 'red', 'conveniently', 'have', 'already', 'sent', 'rovers', 'Mars', 'know', 'soil', 'made', 'red', 'sand', 'not', 'blood', 'vessels', 'veining', 'surface', 'sort', 'intelligence-insulting', 'approach', 'ultimately', 'TWOTW', 'cinematic', 'mediocrity', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'had', 'one', 'alien', 'ships', 'spit', 'out', 'little', 'Sojourner', 'NASA', 'Mars', 'rover', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'frightening', 'signaled', 'Spilberg', 'respected', 'intelligence', 'being', 'too', 'lazy', 'indifferent', 'caught', 'up', 'special', 'effects', 'Spielberg', 'add', 'small', 'touches', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'TWOTW', 'standout.WOTW', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'summer', 'movie', 'strong', 'start', 'more', 'few', 'incredible', 'ideas', 'visuals', 'indicate', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'judge', 'ongoing', 'discussions', 'household', 'riddled', 'so', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'mysteries', 'inconsistencies', 'believability', 'sapped', 'corpses', 'humans', 'Martians', 'farmed', '.With', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'belt', 'Spielberg', 'should', 'realize', 'story', 'stupid', 'let', 'effects', 'serve', 'plot', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'round']",N/A

Cruise stars as Ray Ferrier, an estranged father who works long hours loading cargo.  A loner with very little parenting skills, Ray must now watch over his two children, Rachel (Fanning), a young girl with a much older personality, and Robbie (Chatwin), who has no relationship whatsoever with his father.  Robbie even calls his father by his first name during much of the film.Soon, strange events begin to happen around the world.  Strange thunderstorms are occuring, and in Ray's town, an unusual phenomena is occuring in the sky.  Winds increase, and soon, streets begin to buckle.  From under the streets emerge strange, three-legged alien monsters which begin shooting at the stunned civilians.  Ray, Rachel, and Robbie manage to find a vehicle that still runs (apparently, the aliens' presence has somehow affected the performance of many mechanical items), and they try to flee from the aliens.Later, Ray and Robbie become separated from each other, and Ray and Rachel seek refuge in a basement owned by a man (Tim Robbins) with his own ideas on how to bring down the aliens.  However, these ideas lead to conflict between him and Ray.  After struggling to escape the basement, Ray and Rachel encounter one of the aliens up close, and are picked up and deposited inside, along with many other civilians.  Will Ray and Rachel survive?  What will become of the earth?From Orson Wells' radio broadcast during the Great Depression to the original War of the Worlds film in the 1950s to this new version, people have been fascinated with H.G. Wells' science fiction story.  This movie is very good and does a good job of depicting the events of Wells' story.  Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and Justin Chatwin do a fine job as the estranged family forced by events beyond their control to join together in order to survive, and Tim Robbins' portrayal of the strange man in the basement is equally good.I'm a big science fiction fan, and I highly recommend this movie.

She's the daughter of Tom Cruise who is forever cradling and holding the little shrieking brat. What most movie-goers certainly wanted was for Cruise to give her a good smack to shut her up. Equally as irritating is Cruise's creepy son who is so asinine and repellant that he's another character who needs a good smack or two. They have endless arguments, even when the alien monsters are literally at their heels. During the scene when the aliens are racing closer, the son screams at Tom for being a lousy father and therefore it's time for sonny boy to join the military. While this is going on, the shrieking daughter has wandered out into the woods where she sees bodies floating in the river and of course this gives the screamer a chance to exercise her lungs again.The big basement scene was effectie with the  monsters actually showing themselves--yet,again, the atmosphere of terror was dissipated when Cruise argues with the house owner over the owner's desire to fire upon the intruders. While the creepy aliens are moving all over the basement, the two men are still arguing and we all have the fierce desire to give Cruise a big slap on his boyish face.The ending is so terrible that you watch it dumbfounded and asking yourself: can this be real? Although most of Boston has been devastated by the aliens, the sole remaining house just happens to be untouched and who should come bounding down the steps but Cruise's ex-wife and Tom's irritating brat of a son.

635247,A2JXM2910HL9FY,B00005JNTI,"JG ""Jake""","[1, 6]","War Of The Worlds is a reimagining of a classic novel and film, modernized with incredible special effects, cinematography, sound, and big screen actors. Adding up to make one of the most intense experiences in blockbuster movies as of late. But there is much more to this movie than the special effects, and Tom Cruise's reputation. Lying underneath the surface of this sci-fi thriller is the fearful disposition of America and Global Village in the aftermath of 9/11.Where Spielberg's Munich explored the immorality and paranoia brought on by retaliation in response to terrorist actions, his take on War Of The Worlds gives the audience a reflection of the state of fear society has worked itself into. This is glimpsed in many key moments, like when Cruise's Ray Ferrier is driving his kids out of the city and his son is asking if it was terrorists attacking. The greatest example however is Tim Robbins' character who can be seen as a reflection (or parody) of the everyman, hiding out in his basement with the windows boarded up, always having his shotgun and ax within reach if the time comes for their use. Robbins' freaking out and uncontrollable yelling perhaps a message to the audience that we need to calm down and think rationally. Moments where this subtle post-9/11 disposition hit home are scattered throughout the movie, making for a very interesting and relevant moviegoing experience.Where in the past, Spielberg has used a clean cinematic look and visual scheme to his films like Jurrasic Park and Jaws, here there is grim, dark, bleached, and shimmering quality to everything. Even in the first twenty minutes before the attacks begin, a normal day in the city is washed out with bright white light. It seems that Spielberg used more light sensitive film stock for this flick. And at it's darkest, the atmosphere is turned into a grim subtle neon nightmare. The sound in the film is terrifying. The sound of the Tripods approaching easily bringing to mind the T-Rex of Jurrasic Park, and the horn noise that the Tripods sound equals if not drowns out the T-Rex's roar.The movie also makes great use of long-take sequences and shots lifted right out of the opening sequence of A Touch Of Evil, Orson Welles would be proud. The long-take shooting establishes incredible suspense like in the basement sequence where Tom Cruise and Tim Robbins are looking out at the Tripods from boarded up windows around the basement.The writers have done a great job as well, creating human characters that we all could relate to in times like these. Ray Ferrier the divorced father who's only looking out for himself, but learning along the way that family comes first. Tim Robbins as the paranoid creepy basement dweller bent on winning against the aliens single-handedly. The list goes on. Most importantly though, this movie is not about Tom Cruise saving the world, but it's about Tom Cruise saving his family. Though there is not much depth to this story, how far can you go after all when you're writing a movie about an alien invasion of Earth? The story has enough subtlety in it's exposition, as well as humanity in it's characters, to keep it interesting.Even if you just want to watch something entertaining, this is by far the most entertaining and moving movie to come out in summer 2005 season. And if you are looking for food for thought, this one has enough implicit meanings and views to keep you interested for a good while. War Of The Worlds successfully combines two things that were thought to be light years apart in Hollywood Cinema today, sheer blockbuster entertainment and deep meaning and relevance.",4,War Of The Worlds,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,3632,"['War', 'Worlds', 'reimagining', 'classic', 'novel', 'film', 'modernized', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'big', 'screen', 'actors', 'Adding', 'up', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'experiences', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'late', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'reputation', 'Lying', 'surface', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'fearful', 'disposition', 'America', 'Global', 'Village', 'aftermath', '9/11.Where', 'Spielberg', 'Munich', 'explored', 'immorality', 'paranoia', 'brought', 'retaliation', 'response', 'terrorist', 'actions', 'take', 'War', 'Worlds', 'audience', 'reflection', 'state', 'fear', 'society', 'worked', 'glimpsed', 'many', 'key', 'moments', 'when', 'Cruise', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'driving', 'kids', 'city', 'son', 'asking', 'was', 'terrorists', 'attacking', 'greatest', 'example', 'however', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'reflection', 'parody', 'everyman', 'hiding', 'out', 'basement', 'windows', 'boarded', 'up', 'always', 'having', 'shotgun', 'ax', 'reach', 'time', 'use', 'Robbins', 'freaking', 'uncontrollable', 'yelling', 'perhaps', 'message', 'audience', 'need', 'calm', 'down', 'think', 'rationally', 'Moments', 'where', 'subtle', 'post-9/11', 'disposition', 'hit', 'home', 'are', 'scattered', 'movie', 'making', 'very', 'interesting', 'relevant', 'moviegoing', 'experience.Where', 'past', 'Spielberg', 'used', 'clean', 'cinematic', 'look', 'visual', 'scheme', 'films', 'Jurrasic', 'Park', 'Jaws', 'here', 'grim', 'dark', 'bleached', 'shimmering', 'quality', 'everything', 'Even', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'attacks', 'begin', 'normal', 'day', 'city', 'washed', 'out', 'bright', 'white', 'light', 'Spielberg', 'used', 'more', 'light', 'sensitive', 'film', 'stock', 'flick', 'darkest', 'atmosphere', 'turned', 'grim', 'subtle', 'neon', 'nightmare', 'sound', 'film', 'terrifying', 'sound', 'Tripods', 'approaching', 'easily', 'bringing', 'mind', 'T-Rex', 'Jurrasic', 'Park', 'horn', 'noise', 'Tripods', 'sound', 'equals', 'not', 'drowns', 'out', 'T-Rex', 'roar.The', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'use', 'long-take', 'sequences', 'shots', 'lifted', 'right', 'opening', 'sequence', 'A', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'long-take', 'shooting', 'establishes', 'incredible', 'suspense', 'basement', 'sequence', 'where', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'are', 'looking', 'out', 'Tripods', 'boarded', 'up', 'windows', 'basement.The', 'writers', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'creating', 'human', 'characters', 'could', 'relate', 'times', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'divorced', 'father', 'who', 'only', 'looking', 'out', 'learning', 'way', 'family', 'first', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'paranoid', 'creepy', 'basement', 'dweller', 'bent', 'winning', 'aliens', 'single-handedly', 'list', 'Most', 'importantly', 'movie', 'not', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'saving', 'world', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'saving', 'family', 'not', 'much', 'depth', 'story', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'when', ""'re"", 'writing', 'movie', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Earth', 'story', 'enough', 'subtlety', 'exposition', 'as', 'well', 'humanity', 'characters', 'keep', 'interesting.Even', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'entertaining', 'far', 'most', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'summer', '2005', 'season', 'are', 'looking', 'food', 'thought', 'one', 'enough', 'implicit', 'meanings', 'views', 'keep', 'interested', 'good', 'while', 'War', 'Worlds', 'successfully', 'two', 'things', 'were', 'thought', 'be', 'light', 'years', 'apart', 'Hollywood', 'Cinema', 'today', 'sheer', 'blockbuster', 'entertainment', 'deep', 'meaning', 'relevance']",N/A

635251,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00005JNTI,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[0, 0]","War of the Worlds is one of the most breathtaking movies I've ever seen. Once it starts it takes you and never lets go. The attack on the city is done in a more realistic way than ID4.  Spielberg always wanted to make a War of the Worlds movie and this is a remake that's actually extremely good. It's about a construction worker (Tom Cruise), who gets his kids for a weekened.After a huge lightning storm Cruise goes outside to check up on things. Him and some neighbors examine a hole in the street until suddenly it starts getting bigger and bigger. Then that's when the alien ships start coming from under ground. They start out by blowing up some people while Cruise and many others run in horror. Cruise goes back to his kids in shock and starts packing things. Then he steals a neighbors truck because he realizes an even bigger attack is just moments away.Although Tom Cruise is a bit nuts these days  he's still one of the best actors around. Although the attacks and the aliens are more of the star than him, he still gives a great performance. Dakota Fanning (Man on Fire) is equally good as his daughter. Tim Robbins (Mystic River) as a nut with a shot gun who takes Cruise and Fanning into hiding steals the show in a small part.The movie never lets up. When you think it's taking a break from attacks, there's another scene full of tension and then another and another. I think this is Spielberg's most terrifying ride, even more so than Jurassic Park and Jaws. When the movie was over barely anyone talked or could move. It just takes so much out of you.

635262,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005JNTI,John Kwok,"[5, 9]","Stephen Spielberg's ""War Of The Worlds"" is truer in spirit to the dark, brooding literary atmosphere conjured up by H. G. Wells than in the 1953 film directed by George Pal. Not only that, it resonates strongly with visual echoes from two of Spielberg's great 1990s films, ""Jurassic Park"" and especially, ""Schindler's List"". This film is not one for the faint-hearted; it is truly more a horror film than yet another science fiction film replete with excellent special effects from Industrial Light and Magic. But it is a horror film blessed with splendid cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and a fine, often understated, film score composed by John Williams.I had some misgivings with Tom Cruise cast as the lead, Ray Ferrier, but to his credit, Cruise does a fine job as the average Joe longshoreman who is forced to take his children to safety, fleeing the rapidly advancing alien tripod war machines. And Dakota Fanning's performance as his daughter may be the best acting I've seen from a young actress since Jodie Foster in ""Taxi Driver"". Tim Robbins is equally superb in a supporting role as the creepy hermit Ogilvy. Last, but not least, there's fine acting too from Miranda Otto as Ferrier's ex-wife with cameo appearances from Gene Barry and Ann Robinson - who starred in the original 1953 film - as her parents.There are many overt and implicit references to 9/11/01 scattered throughout the film, most notably the scenes showing photographs of missing - and presumed murdered by the tripods - people. There are many ghastly scenes of people being blown up, zapped into dust, or engulfed alive by the tripods; all of these seem as real as the pictures I saw of people jumping from the burning World Trade Center towers. Some of the most beautiful imagery deals directly with these deaths, for example with the hordes of empty clothing which fall gently from the sky, representing the only tangible remains of those vaporized or devoured by the alien tripods.If I have one major criticism of the film, then it is how neatly Spielberg and his screen co-writers, Josh Friedman and David Koepp, tie up all the loose ends, leaving the audience with a terse, tearful, yet happy family reunion. The film may have had more realism if one of the main characters was killed or subjected to serious bodily harm. Otherwise, I highly recommend this film as a compelling example of fictional disaster filmmaking. It is one of the most emotionally riveting films I have seen in the last year or so; it certainly deserves to be seen by a wide audience this summer.",5,Fine Cinematic Adaptation of H. G.

Then we get Speilberg.Steven Spielberg's winningest formula is to mate contemporary family dynamics (and their resonant emotions) with good stories about extraordinary situations.It's just a formula though, and, as such, can be an enemy to creativity.H.G. Wells wrote this great story a hundred years ago:  some alien species has wanted to take over our planet for millenia and decide to activate their plan today.So, you ask, how does this figure with a divorced father from New Jersey who likes great Fords and the Beach Boys?  (And who, based on his accent, sounds like he spent maybe overnight in north Jersey.)That's kinda the point:  it does not figure.  There are so many masterfully controlled images and sounds coming at you here, that you get to thinking that the auteur does not want you doing much figuring at all.  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, keep the effects coming fast and close.Speilberg knows how to punch an audience's buttons and keep them coming back for that all-important repeat business.  Here, I'm not so sure.  I cannot bring to mind any scene that ""I just gotta see again,"" like the T-Rex attack in Jurassic Park I or almost any action sequence in ""Jaws.""And the family element:  you do not end up caring for what happens to them with the same level of empathy as with other Speilbergs, even though you're supposed to.  Maybe it's Cruise's limits as an actor, but maybe it's the inconsistencies and shallowness of how each character is developed...Well, it's a good movie, but not a great movie.  And it's really, really formulaic - perhaps its greatest disappointment.Someone else says of the John Williams soundtrack that it's like getting a very good meal (but not an excellent meal) in the town's best restaurant:  it's disappointing, but where are you going to get anything better?That's it exactly.  So far, this has not been a great summer for movies.

635267,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B00005JNTI,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[2, 4]","In a pre-release interview, Spielberg said that the film WOTW may center around space aliens bent on annihilating humans, but the REAL story is about FAMILY.Ugh.  The last time Spielberg used a high-profile, big-budget movie to paste his views on family values on the screen, he gave us ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"", which is one of the very lamest movies in contemporary film history.  In that film, as I feared he might repeat in WOTW, all the potential fun and/or terror that a dinosaur movie could contain was completely neutered by Spielberg's waving of his family-value wand.I was afraid that WOTW would be a repeat of that, so I entered the cinema with trepidation.  Would I be disappointed by Spielberg yet again?  His talent as a filmmaker is not in question.  But certainly not every film he makes belongs on the AFI Top 100 list, and each new film of his shouldn't come pre-packaged as ""The Terrific New Spielberg Film"" just because he hit a few homeruns over the past 30 years.The Rolling Stones are arguably the best, most prolific, and most popular rock band in the world.  But not every album of theirs is a keeper.  Likewise, Spielberg is gonna churn out some dispensible duds now and again (""Hook"", ""Minority Report"" - sorry, but MR was a just a tired story with spiffy effects - , and ""The Lost World"").So I went to see WOTW expecting that the special effects would be great (Spielberg may have directed, but the Effects Teams did the real grunt work and gave it artistry), but that it would suffer from the same sappy Spielberg touches that derail so many of his high-profile efforts.If he wants to make a movie about family values, fine.  Go ahead.  But please, Steve, don't take a project like a WOTW concept, package and sell it to the world as a Summer Fun Ride about evil aliens, and then deliver us a film where the basic concept of the story takes a backseat to your personal agenda about what gives you the big warm-and-fuzzy.The film itself, happy to say, is not as heavy-handed in the ""family values"" department as I'd feared it would be.  Oh it certainly is there, to be sure, but in a swallowable dose.Other reviewers have mentioned either specifically or generally the plot and logic holes large enough to drive a spaceship through.  And there are plenty of those holes.  I won't try to ""show off how smart or observant I am"" by listing them or trying to have the longest or most insightful list (or take pride in being the first reviewer to post certain ones).But here's what's good, and here's what's not so good:GOOD:  The film's first act is the strongest and most compelling to watch, though it would have been even better had the film unit sought the technical advice of an expert on human crowd/mob behavior during times of extreme crisis or emotional distress.The mechanical tripods the aliens pilot are impressively ominous and creepy.  I just LOVED the horn-like sound it made.  Good job, Sound Designer!!!About midway through the film, there is a brief disturbing scene involving the commandeering of a van that speaks volumes about mob mentality and panic behavior.  I thought that scene rang the most truthful of all the scenes involving the panicking Earthlings.The NOT-SO-GOOD: The film loses steam in the third act.  Since we get to see the killer machines and what they can do so early on, the only way to sustain interest and tension is for the terror to increase as the film goes on.  Once the initial ""Wow"" factor has subsided, there had better be some terror and surprises left over to keep the film moving.  But there isn't really any of that - just a child-in-jeopardy moment and the ""Wow"" factor that Tom could walk scores of miles to and through Boston in such short time.DISAPPOINTMENT:  For a movie about global human destruction, we get to see very little of it.  Granted, we don't want generic cutaway scenes to all the major cities like in some crap-fest movie by Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich.  But considering the aliens' killer machines are having to take out these humans one-by-one [The aliens have the technology to bury machines under the earth and travel kazillions of miles to eventually use them, but they can't come up with a more efficient way to kill us?  Imagine that instead of spraying your kitchen for ants, you decide to grab them one by one and kill them.  Duh.], it just seems like for an annihilation project this massive, we'd see more machines being used.  Oh, and while an Army unit with helicopters, fighter jets, and rocket-propelled grenades are useless against the tripods, one or two hand-grenades thrown by the movie's central character works just fine.I wonder if film-makers like Spielberg ever actually watch their own films with an audience member's pair of eyes anymore.  I wonder if they are even capable.  Filmmakers tend to be good at ripping logic and continuity holes in all films except their own.FINAL THOUGHTS:  This will probably be a cool DVD release, but because of the technical behind-the-scenes stuff only.  Few films that start out great but peter out in the end ever retain solid reputations in the long run or merit repeat viewings over the years.And lastly,  I will never forget that Spielberg has said on many occasions that he could not make a movie like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" today.  He made that when he was single and childless, and that now as a hubby and father he could never make a film about a guy who abandons his family.  Sounds like Tom Cruise's character in ""WOTW"" is meant to compensate for that.  But since when do we want our chief filmmakers to sacrifice a good story at the altar of sentiment?  I say we should give the good, challenging, adventurous film projects to the lean and hungry filmmakers who want more than anything to tell a great story, and who could care less whether it reflects their current domestic situation.",3,Exceeded my VERY low expectations,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,5880,"['pre-release', 'interview', 'Spielberg', 'said', 'film', 'WOTW', 'may', 'center', 'around',

635269,A28LG2MEWGLKZW,B00005JNTI,Jonathan S. Kemp,"[1, 5]","""War of the Worlds"" has a simple plot, one that an aspiring science fiction writer in high school could think of: aliens invade our planet to destroy all human beings, and there's little we can do to stop them.  Very simple.  But this simplicity leads us to ask several questions.  Why are the aliens killing us?  Where did they come from?  Why kill us now?  We (as viewers) are never told why.  All we know is that people want to live and escape from the invaders, and that people will do everything they can to stay alive.  This straightforward premise is a setup for Steven Spielberg to utilize astounding visual effects for the sole purpose of evoking some very basic emotions in the audience, mainly fear and wonder.  ""War of the Worlds"" succeeds in that it's a gripping, immersive movie, and its ambiguous plot allows it to be this way, becoming one of the greatest strengths of the film.  By stripping away unsatisfactory explanations for why the aliens are on Earth, and by avoiding the typical disaster movie clich&eacute; of following the nation's reaction, the world's reactions, and by just focusing on the response of one man and his family, Spielberg creates a more intense movie.  Showing the invasion from Ray's (Tom Cruise) point of view puts us closer to the action.  Ray doesn't know the answers to the questions of ""why"", and neither do we.  This makes the fundamental thought process of the audience not ""how should we defeat the aliens as a nation?"" but ""how is Ray going to stay alive?"" The close proximity of the audience to Ray and his family forces us to wonder how we would handle such a situation, what we would do to protect those that we know, and by avoiding the extraneous and making us examine such possibilities through Spielberg's main character, each action set piece and visual spectacle is filled with an underlying sense of dread, wonder, and unbridled intensity.

Tom Cruise plays a working-class New Jersey man named Ray Ferrier, a divorced guy who shares custody of the children with ex-wife, Mary Ann, played by the lovely Miranda Otto of Lord of the Rings fame.The kids, a rebellious, teenage son and a precocious but annoyingly inquisitive, preteen daughter are to spend days with Ray and successfully play to their father's weaknesses. Ray is unable to communicate effectively with his son, who is too preoccupied with his Ipod and his planned excursions to heed any parental advice; to add to the problem, Ray is so worn out from the stresses of a working environment that he does not have the proper level of decompression, thus patience, to enjoy the company of his daughter, who bombards him with innocent questions.If it were not for the guy playing the role, the viewer might be led to think that Mr. Ferrier will meet ultimate ruin when the aliens come to town. Ironically, it is when the aliens surface and create havoc that Ray is, by and large, the guy in control because he is one of the few who can keep his emotions in check during this time of crisis.For those watching War of the Worlds who, including myself, were looking for, at least, a magic bullet solution (as was hilariously portrayed in Mars Attacks) to the continual annihilation caused by the aliens, there was no apparent sign of creative ingenuity that would guarantee the preservation of humanity on planet Earth. However, key components to survival were the resourcefulness and persistence needed to ensure that self-destructive tendencies and the dreaded aliens, both of which virtually guaranteed an instantaneous death, would be kept at bay.If there is a lesson to be learned or, at least, reminded of from this Hollywood triumph, it is that one should learn how and when to pick and choose his or her battles, especially if the opponent is almost impossible to size up.",4,"Moments of Genius?

635273,ANRD10YW616JL,B00005JNTI,Joseph Guyer,"[3, 6]","Most alien invasion/disaster movies suffer from information and perspective overload. They are usually told from an omniscient point of view. Think Independence Day or Day After Tomorrow: both have a zillion speaking roles, so you don't really get to know any of the characters. Plus, the audience is treated to a God's-eye-view of the world. This way, you get to see aliens and hurricanes blowing up national landmarks like the Statue of Liberty. By the end of these movies, you tend to feel numb.War of the Worlds, quite on the contrary, suffers from a LACK of perspective. Unlike most characters in world-wide disaster movies, Tom Cruise's character is a blue collar boob, whose ""story"" is not a very compelling one. He's not a scientist or fighter pilot or the President, so he doesn't know anything about the invading aliens. And because the film's POV is restricted to him, YOU don't know anything about them either. Which is okay, but I can't help feeling frustrated some of the time.That's part of the problem with this movie. Another major problem falls on one single scene; or, rather, the entire last quarter of the movie: the basement scene. What a mistake that whole sequence was. It completely undermines the terror and fright the aliens commanded earlier in the movie because it suggests that they are, well, kinda dumb. They rely exclusively on optics to determine whether there are any life forms in the basement before they enter. Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning's characters dodge the alien's electric eye, and this is supposed to be suspenseful. Yes, Spielberg was paying homage to the 1950s WotW, but the idea doesn't work in tech-savvy 2005. Don't the aliens have x-rays or heat seeking devices or some other technology to determine if there are people hiding in the basement?Plus, Tim Robbins' character is absolutely pointless to the story. He represents humanity's blind rage and fighting spirit, but since that sub-story isn't pursued, he serves no purpose.The other problem is the ending. I don't think I've ever seen a worse deus ex machina. You can't help rolling your eyes.However, the movie has wonderful special effects, and Spielberg slightly bleaches the film to make everything look gritty and realistic, and, I think, it helps the CGIs blend in.

I am glad I did.  Tom Cruise does an excellent job as an estranged father trusted with his kids when the invasion begins.  Cruise portrays a crane operator with simple desires who comes off as a true everyman through the course of the film.Unlike the book, we do not know where the aliens come from, but come they do.  Very quickly much of humanity is either destroyed or fleeing the death rays wielded by the tripods.  Cruise clings to the only idea he can come up with which is to go to his ex in Boston.  The relentless aliens push the film at a breakneck pace until Cruise and family hole up in a farmhouse (true to the original).  The film then moves to its expected conclusion.The aliens were not as original as claimed.  Their unique attributes were hidden in almost all of the scenes.  What we saw looked remarkably like short versions of the Independence Day aliens.  Also, in the documentary on the disk we hear from creators discussing their new and original ideas all of which were in the book or earlier film versions.

I wore out my first copy of War of the Worlds so I had to buy another here.  I wish I had seen this production in the theater; the first time I saw it on my 7-inch DVD player, I knew I would have been blown away.  Right out of the gate, the opening titles have descending stars as part of the studio's standard intro, which with later viewings suggest the upcoming assault.  Morgan Freeman's opening narration is chillingly done, though his last few words ('plotted against us') are spoken very quietly and get stepped on.  ILM did a fantastic job on the alien machines. Whoever was responsible for the sound did a superb job as well; througout the film, sound is used to set and sustain a deeply menacing atmosphere.  The editing is perfect.  The pacing is frenetic when it should be, and quieter times only serve to set up the next betrayal of the viewer's burgeoning complacency.  The film opens with a dysfunctional family scene, but that's there to explain the character interactions coming up very soon.  Each scene serves a purpose; unlike another movie I reviewed, you could list all the scenes here in your shoot table and fill in the Purpose column per shot.  Film classes can discuss the various treatments of the 1938 story, from parables about the Nazi menace or Communism over the horizon, to this sociological approach:  how does a dysfunctional group - a broken family in this case, but you could as easily focus on the old standby 'strangers in a boat - interact when placed under increasing stress?  Sometimes they unite.  Sometimes people turn against each other.  Sometimes pre-existing resentments are broken from their restraints under stress, or unanticipated allegiances form, only to shatter once the external threat is removed.  There are many treatments of that theme, and I compliment all involved here for not copping out by turning Dad and the kids into an Ozzie and Harriet God Bless Us Everyone family again at the end.  Tom Cruise plays his Top Gun character - the irresponsible man-child flung into crisis who has to find inner strength to redeem himself - but I forgave him for it in this movie.

I left my chair only once and that was to make sure the doors were locked.The main character in War of the Worlds is Ray Ferrier, a divorced father of two children, and initially not very likeable. He didn't seem to really know his children and apparently there was a lot of ugly baggage left over from the marriage. Saying that, I also have to say that his daughter and son were not very likeable either.  The children resented their father and it was clear they preferred their step-dad. They obviously reflected their mother's feelings and were mean-mouthed and very disrespectful to their father.  Dakota Fanning played the daughter.  She is a joy to see, but her screaming and tantrums were pretty annoying.  I'm not sure if that was over acting, or over direction, but I did not find her a sympathetic character.When the Aliens attack Earth, the children are spending a weekend with their Dad. After he watches a strange sky with what appears to be horrific lightening, and then sees some kind of vehicle coming up from under the street, he realizes that the Earth is being attacked.  He has to pull himself together, make a plan of survival and take care of a pre-teen and teenager who will not willingly do anything that he asks.  The alien attack is terrifying and the special effects are really well done.  Ray Ferrier is put to the test and throws himself into protecting his children in any way that he can think of.  Tom Cruise was believable in the role and turns Ray Ferrier into the real father that his children need.",4,---Riveting---,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1605,"['knew', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'nevertheless', 'film', 'surprised', 'left', 'chair', 'only', 'once', 'was', 'make', 'sure', 'doors', 'were', 'locked.The', 'main', 'character', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'divorced', 'father', 'two', 'children', 'initially', 'not', 'very', 'likeable', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'know', 'children', 'apparently', 'was', 'lot', 'ugly', 'baggage', 'left', 'over', 'marriage', 'Saying', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'daughter', 'son', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'likeable', 'children', 'resented', 'father', 'was', 'clear', 'preferred', 'step-dad', 'obviously', 'reflected', 'mother', 'feelings', 'were', 'mean-mouthed', 'very', 'disrespectful', 'father', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'played', 'daughter', 'joy', 'see', 'screaming', 'tantrums', 'were', 'pretty', 'annoying', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'acting', 'direction', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'sympathetic', 'character.When', 'Aliens', 'attack', 'Earth', 'children', 'are', 'spending', 'weekend', 'Dad', 'strange', 'sky', 'what', 'be', 'horrific', 'lightening', 'then', 'kind', 'vehicle', 'coming', 'up', 'street', 'Earth', 'being', 'attacked', 'pull', 'together', 'make', 'plan', 'survival', 'take', 'care', 'pre-teen', 'teenager', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'willingly', 'do', 'anything', 'alien', 'attack', 'terrifying', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'put', 'test', 'protecting', 'children', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'believable', 'role', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'real', 'father', 'children', 'need']",N/A

Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning put on great performances, and the special effects and suspense were great.Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a deadbeat mean Dad whos kids despise coming to visit him. Dakota Fanning plays Rachel, his young daughter whos main role in this film is screaming and playing the child-in-distress. And an actor who I am not familiar with plays Robbie, Ray's teenage rebel son. When a viscous thunderstorm breaks out, lightning strikes a hole in the ground and an enormous tripod-like machine breaks out of the ground and begins firing lasers and killing everyone around. The special effects were great, all of the buildings and the bridge collapsing. I felt the terror of the townspeople when they were getting killed one by one in front of my eyes. Ray and his family escapes in a stolen car, and one scene which was one of best in the entire movie, was when they drove through a town of frightened townspeople who were all trying to steal Ray's car, they were rocking it back and forth and breaking windows and trying to hurt the family, and Ray started to fight them and threatened them with a gun. This was an emotional scene because Ray was trying to save his family but the townspeople kept beating them up, and I felt the anger for them that Ray felt.Tim Robbins also plays a small role as a survivor that lets Ray and Rachel hide in his basement with them (Robbie went missing when the tripods attacked a hillside Robbie was standing on). He goes crazy and tries to dig a hole towards the city, and Ray kills him, I guess he just wanted to put him out of his misery. He was starting to go insane anyways, though.The aliens do eventually come out of their ships, but they look like the aliens in every other alien movie. They reminded me of spider-like versions of the aliens in Independence Day.The movie does have its cheesy moments in it, like Ray being the only one in the street not shot to bits by the laser, and him just barely escaping getting sucked into the red suction mouth in the cage in the spaceship. Also, Dakota Fanning doesn't seem to move when the spaceship looks her in the face and then scoops her up. I would've been out of the there in one second! And Robbie is back at the end of the film, and I don't understand how he escaped the hill, which was entirely engulfed in flames. And the worst of all, the people sometimes seem to run TOWARDS the ships instead of away.This movie maybe doesn't have Oscar-potential, but is definitely an entertaining and suspenseful summer flick, one of the films that they call ""popcorn flicks"". Spielberg can still direct amazing films, and Cruise can still put on great performances, either as the hero (Mission:Impossible) or the villian (Collateral), he still is good at what he does. And he has a great-looking girlfriend.

635286,A2SH17ZKPJNI76,B00005JNTI,Karen Sampson Hudson,"[4, 6]","Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" might engender some nightmares in people of all ages, as the latter two-thirds of the movie are mostly action shots of the horror of humans trying to fight off an immensely superior alien attack.  The first part of the movie is composed of scenes of ordinary life, as Ray (Tom Cruise) gets weekend custody of his kids from his pregnant ex-wife and spouse: Ordinary bitterness, ordinary sarcasm, ordinary teen-age angst. Ray plays catch with his son in the back yard of his row house, and prompts him to do homework, then collapses to sleep after a double-shift stevedore workday.Soon the terror begins, with an extraordinarily intense lightning storm, as the sky darkens and a strange light shines through the clouds.  Ray, son Robbie and ten-year old daughter Rachel, begin an increasingly desperate journey, a flight/fight for their lives, as the (strangely amphibian looking) alien creatures destroy everything in their path.  The action is non-stop, with little time for character portrayal (other than that  brave/foolish  Robbie wants to join the national guard units fighting the invaders, and Rachel screams quite a bit, and we learn that she suffers from claustrophobia) as Ray tries to save his family.As sci-fi movies goes, Spielberg has done well, with the plentiful, expert special effects we associate with him.

635289,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JNTI,Kaya Savas,"[5, 7]","MOVIE: Well here it is, the big one. The movie that's supposed to end the 18 week slump at the box office, the one that's gonna rake in huge numbers. Well, hopefully it will. I mean, I believe Kingdom of Heaven was supposed to do that, and I also believe that Batman Begins was to do that as well. When you walk into a Spielberg film you have a few expectations, and that becomes a burden. That burden will grow heavier and heavier as a filmmaker does more projects, and projects of superior quality. The public has pretty damn high expectations for #1 all time director (as voted in a poll). So does he fill those expectations . . . yes, to an extent. War of the Worlds is a movie about a divorced father taking care of his kids for the weekend, unfortunetly this weekend was the weekend that the Martians planned a global destruction of Earth. Let me tell you, this movie is on you seat entertainment, Spielberg grabs your attention and will not let go. Marketing for this film was brilliant since they kept the lid on tight. We did not see anything in the teasers, trailers, or tv spots. So the moment all hell is unleashed your jaws will be as low as the actors' in a state of awe. The film is breathtaking, it really is. The action in the film is structured with perfection, especially this one scene in the basement of a house as Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and Tim Robbins are trying to keep out of the aliens' sight. You will find yourself holding your breath as the tension builds. But when we come to the storyline, that is where the movie falls short. The action is compelling, but the characters themselves are not. At least not enough. I read many reviews that complain of a lack of emotion. Believe me, there is lots of emotion. The characters are all well developed, but they don't go anywhere. When you give an audience that much to work with you have to have a grand culmination in the end, and the script just doesn't deliver. I know David Koepp isn't the master when it comes to writing detailed character studies, but he's done much better in the past. I felt like I was cut short in the end, like there was supposed to be more. This is his third time writing for Spielberg, he wrote the screenplays for Jurassic Park and The Lost World. Unfortunetly he wasn't able to pull through here.  In Jurassic Park there was less focus on the characters and more focus on the dinosaurs, those dinosaurs were the stars of the movie. So the character development in those films didn't have to be deep because we saw lots and lots of dinosaurs. When it comes to War of the Worlds we have to make this journey with three major characters. We only see the actual aliens in two different scenes, the rest of the time we see their tripods. There is no emotion in a huge metal killing machine, only action. So in the end when it came to wrap things up with the main characters, we didn't get to. Instead the focus was wrapping up with the action, and that made the movie fall short for me.ACTING: Dakota Fanning is a fine actress and I truly believe she'll be around as an actress for as long as she wants. I remember all the talk about Haley Joel Osment being the incredible child prodigy, but he just couldn't get rid of that ""cutesy wootsy"" way of his and it failed. Dakota Fanning speaks and acts very maturely and you don't get that impression of a child actress. Tom Cruise does his usual, I mean he really doesn't change anything from film to film and that works. He naturally works in every movie, but I don't think it will ever get him an Oscar. He will always be Tom Cruise, but I think this Katie Holmes thing is gonna do to him what Jennifer Lopez did to Ben Affleck. Hopefully the tabloids won't destroy him because I like Tom Cruise.BOTTOM LINE: I really found the movie to be entertaining even though Koepp's script falls short in the end. Spielberg knows what he wants, and when he knows it he'll go for it. With E.T he found a way into the warmth of our hearts, with Close Encounters he found his way into our curiosity, and now with War of the Worlds he found his way with chaos and terror.

Based on a large sample size of about 1000 this film only rated three to four stars with Amazon fans, which really surprised me. Looking at the profile it appeared that fans were equally divided on the movie, perhaps because about half were comparing this movie with the original.  Notwithstanding, Tom Cruise and everybody involved did their jobs very well, and the film entertained and kept my interest to the end.Just one negative comment-I own Blu Ray and the basic DVD copies and it is difficult to tell the difference. Some movies don't warrant Blu Ray and others like Avatar really do.So many changes were made to the story that I felt it was worth seeing the movie.  I wouldn't have enjoyed seeing the first film with updated special effects. As far as comments against the basic plot as being silly and this version being projected through the eyes of a non-scientist, I agree, but think this only reflects our times.I think that comparisons with the original great film are impossible to  make, and each film is a product of its time. As far as a contemporary film made for todays audiences is concerned, this movie delivered for me, a long standing fan of sci-fi films.

635293,A27KNXAROMSJ7A,B00005JNTI,"Kelly L. Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[2, 5]","In the summer of 2006, the news of the London terrorist attacks struck me in a very odd way. The night before I was trying very hard to sleep; but every scratch of branch against windowpane and every rumble of thunder during a gentle Michigan storm clenched my body into a hypervigilant cube. The night before, that  was the side effect of having just seen Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds."" The morning of the attacks, it was a reminder of the poisonous nest that's been built around us while we've been sleeping.Spielberg has made no secret that this film is his 9/11 analogy; thereby re-proving the maxim that if a Hollywood director doesn't thump you over the head with any alliteration in his film, he will make sure you hear about it before the film debuts. No matter. The film definitely brought me back, in picture, action, and in ambience, to the way everything felt after the first jihadist attack on American property since the 19th century Barbary raids. What's happening? What's going to happen next? Is anyplace secure? Refugees from alien-singed towns trundle past walls full of ""Have You Seen"" posters, reminiscent of Times Square after the WTC fell. Families panic, trying to find  information in a world-wide, all-media-down situation. Unlike in those days, however, there are few selfless offers of help or camaraderie. For Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) as he tries to keep himself and his two children safe while seeking his estranged wife, life becomes a minute-by-minute fight for survival---against the aliens, against the panic they've created, and against individual people who threaten the trio in attempts to save themselves.The London attacks made me think that the film does a very job of characterizing the threat the world currently faces.  The alien invasion in the film occurs over a number of hours, but in different places across the globe before Ferrier's East Coast burgh is targeted. Characters ignore the reports of strange electrical phenomenon in Ukraine that always proceed these attacks. Ray's family has CNN on, but only Dakota Fanning's character, young Rachel, is watching, and it's not clear how much she grasps. And as the trio fight their way to Boston, where the kids' mom was headed with their stepfather as the film starts, the invasion hits one city after another, rather than all at once. The we-don't-know-what-to-do-but-we-have-to-do-something angle is covered by Ray's son Robbie's quest to join the National Guard and Army troops attacking the alien tripod vehicles. If Al Qaeda had, God forbid, been better organized in 2001, such that they could have hit New York, Madrid, London, and maybe a few Jerusalem restaurants for good measure, all at the same time, would they have succeeded as well as they have? I think not. It is the creeping nature of extremism, its ability up till now to make us the proverbial frog in the pot as the temperature of the water just gradually increases, that has allowed us to sleep. It's allowed various groups to say, ""At least it's not us,"" so far. It allowed the Clinton and early Bush administrations to sleep at the switch, missing or ignoring any clues about terrorists comfortably entering our borders, flight schools and towns.Dakota Fanning is superb in this film.  Cruise sails through.  This is my first time seeing Justin Chatwin, who plays Robbie, and he impressed me as a young actor.  Sometimes Speilberg went a too far out of his way to make the 19th century science fiction story into a 21st century morality tale (after all, if people were all running so fast to get away, would they really post ""Have You Seen..."" posters up on a bulletin board?)  But all in all, it made me jump  in my seat a lot, kept me a wake, and got me thinking.

Tom Cruise really rocks in this movie, as he needs to survive under alien machines attack.  This is a real kind of Steven Spielberg's movie as he does a good job in this action and sci-fi movie.  For the director himself, he should shoot more this kind of sci-fi movies than those regular or romantic movies like ""The Terminal"" in 2004 or ""Catch me if you can"" in 2002.  I mean I am not like hating those, those are good non-action and sci-fi movies by Steven Spielberg but he suits to shoot more of his sci-fi movies and those movie are always performs well in box office.  For this movie, it is a good example as it really performs well in box office.  For the story, it is good because it is exciting.  It talks about Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a working class man living in New Jersey. He's estranged from his family, his life isn't in order, and he's too caught up with himself. But the unthinkable and, ultimately, the unexpected happen to him in an extraordinary sense. His small town life is shaken violently by the arrival of destructive intruders: Aliens that have come en masse to destroy Earth. As they plow through the country in a wave of mass destruction and violence, Ray must come to the defense of his children. As the world must fend for itself by a new and very advanced enemy not of this world, it's inhabitants must save humanity from a far greater force that threatens to destroy it.  For the acting, since this movie doesn't have a lot of people, I will only focus on Tom Cruise.  He acts very well as his role of Ray Ferrier.  For the direction, it is real good.  It is because this movie fills with excitement.  So, it is very well direction.  For the visual, it is excellent because it is a movie with the war with aliens.  Those aliens are very good design.  Also, towards the end of the movie, the police fire the alien machine, I like it and it is so exciting for that visual scene.  The special effects come perfect for this whole movie.  The visual is good with no doubts.  For the music, it is good because it all suits and fills the tense in this movie.  As well as the sound effect, it is so exciting and thrilling.

635296,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B00005JNTI,Kevin J. Loria,"[2, 3]","In ""War Of The Worlds"" (2005) Tom Cruise is believable enough as the protagonist, this time with a name (Ray Ferrier) and estranged children (as a rule in Spielberg's films the children are infinitely more believable than the adults, Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin are no exceptions to this rule). ILM's visuals are chilling and stunning, from the subtle, to the not so subtle, they sell this movie:  ""Martian Tri-Pods, their death rays, and their pilots"" the SFX are as brilliant as you will see this summer. Steven Spielberg's directing is on the money, as always, even Cruise has some genuinely moving performances, but the overall mood the film is hopeless, helpless and as dark as the original material. This maybe the films only fault, at least for American audiences accustomed to a more formulaic ""blockbuster."" The intensity of the film may overcome this hurdle, leaving audiences little time to breath, even the films introduction to Cruise's deadbeat dad is remarkable short before events begin to rapidly unfold.  Some haunting and terrifying images will stay with audiences like: the flaming passenger train speeding by the awestruck refugees, ash and clothing in the aftermath of death rays, and the ""red weed."" The screenplay by Koepp and Friedman, based on H.G. Wells' novel, finds man as great a monster as any invader (as seen in initial evacuation scenes). John Williams, who composes music of such genius so effortlessly that his work is often taken for granted (proven time and time again by his disproportionate number of Oscar noms to wins) here he matches the films frantic pacing with perfection. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and film editing by Michael Kahn are topnotch. Film buffs should watch for an homage or two including an iconic ET prop.

635297,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JNTI,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 4]","Based on H.G. Wells' book, ""War Of The Worlds"" had everything it needed to be a superb film, but it was as dull as the thud of the alien tripods' feet.  The film started out very well, with plenty of build-up to prepare the viewer for what was to happen.  The relentless alien attack was very tense.  There was plenty of pop and fizzle to grab the eyes.  Even in the basement, this film was very tense.  However, the conclusion to this film was wretched.  It totally killed any and every ounce of anxiety that was built up throughout the bulk of the film.  Unlike M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs,"" in which the conclusion was both clever and unexpected, I knew all along what would kill off the aliens.  Unfortunately, I was hoping very terribly that I was wrong.  Whether this was true to the book or not, this was a horrible ending.  Besides, it's called a ""War"" and there was little of that going on.  We are mostly shown thousands of people running for their lives, screaming in fear, with no clue as to what is going on.  When we do see the military, they are getting creamed by these big, bulky tripod vehicles piloted by aliens that look like a cross between the ""Independence Day"" alien and the man-eating plant from ""Little Shop of Horrors.""Though I won't reveal exactly what kills the aliens (admit it, you know humanity prevails, so I'm not spoiling anything here), I will say that I hoped for it to at least be pollution or Barbra Streisand.  There aren't any brilliant scientists who figure out that rum combined with Coke proves to be fatal or even a computer virus as in ""ID4.""  Instead, we are given one of the most anti-climactic endings I've seen in years.  It's as if Spielberg was thinking, ""Okay, we've offed enough humans and sprayed enough red vines, let's kill off the aliens with.....""The special effects, for the most part, are very impressive.  However, in one particular scene, when Tom Cruise crawls out of a basement, the setting is so obviously a studio stage that it's pitiful.  In fact, when Cruise came out of the basement, it looked as if he stepped into the forest where Dorothy found the Tinman in ""Wizard of Oz.""  It was totally laughable and killed the movie's tension abruptly.As far as acting goes, I just couldn't believe Cruise as a down-on-his-luck average joe with a busted family.  He was okay, but he just didn't work as Ray Ferrier.  Dakota Fanning was pretty good in the other movies I've seen her in, but all she did in this movie was scream and annoy the fire out of me.  In fact, the only likeable character in this whole flick is Cruise's son Robbie (Justin Chatwin).  Tim Robbins plays a man who saves Cruise and Fanning, but totally wigs out as his time in the basement moves along.In all actuality, I should give this film only two stars, but the film is so good up until the last twenty or thirty minutes that I do believe it is worthy of at least one viewing.  Also, the special effects really are excellent excepting the silly ""Oz"" set.This is definitely a rental.  I would not purchase this flick unless I was a die-hard Spielberg or Cruise fan.  If you're wanting to see aliens and man go toe-to-toe, watch ""ID4.""  It isn't half as intelligent as this flick, but at least we kick a little more butt than this dud.",3,Spielberg Phones One In,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,3270,"['Based', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'book', 'War', 'Worlds', 'had', 'everything', 'needed', 'be', 'superb', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'dull', 'thud', 'alien', 'tripods', 'feet', 'film', 'started', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'plenty', 'build-up', 'prepare', 'viewer', 'what', 'was', 'happen', 'relentless', 'alien', 'attack', 'was', 'very', 'tense', 'was', 'plenty', 'pop', 'fizzle', 'grab', 'eyes', 'Even', 'basement', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'tense', 'However', 'conclusion', 'film', 'was', 'wretched', 'totally', 'killed', 'ounce', 'anxiety', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'bulk', 'film', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Signs', 'conclusion', 'was', 'clever', 'unexpected', 'knew', 'what', 'would', 'kill', 'off', 'aliens', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'hoping', 'very', 'terribly', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'true', 'book', 'not', 'was', 'horrible', 'ending', 'called', 'War', 'was', 'little', 'going', 'are', 'mostly', 'shown', 'thousands', 'people', 'running', 'lives', 'screaming', 'fear', 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'When', 'do', 'see', 'military', 'are', 'getting', 'creamed', 'big', 'bulky', 'tripod', 'vehicles', 'piloted', 'aliens', 'look', 'cross', 'Independence', 'Day', 'alien', 'man-eating', 'plant', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'exactly', 'what', 'aliens', 'know', 'humanity', 'prevails', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'hoped', 'least', 'be', 'pollution', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'are', ""n't"", 'brilliant', 'scientists', 'who', 'figure', 'out', 'rum', 'combined', 'Coke', 'proves', 'be', 'fatal', 'even', 'computer', 'virus', 'ID4', 'Instead', 'are', 'given', 'one', 'most', 'anti-climactic', 'endings', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'thinking', 'Okay', ""'ve"", 'offed', 'enough', 'humans', 'sprayed', 'enough', 'red', 'vines', 'let', 'kill', 'off', 'aliens', '..', 'special', 'effects', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'However', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'when', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'basement', 'setting', 'so', 'obviously', 'studio', 'stage', 'pitiful', 'fact', 'when', 'Cruise', 'came', 'basement', 'looked', 'stepped', 'forest', 'where', 'Dorothy', 'found', 'Tinman', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'was', 'totally', 'laughable', 'killed', 'movie', 'tension', 'abruptly.As', 'far', 'acting', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Cruise', 'down-on-his-luck', 'average', 'joe', 'busted', 'family', 'was', 'okay', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'did', 'movie', 'was', 'scream', 'annoy', 'fire', 'fact', 'only', 'likeable', 'character', 'whole', 'flick', 'Cruise', 'son', 'Robbie', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'man', 'who', 'Cruise', 'Fanning', 'totally', 'out', 'time', 'basement', 'along.In', 'actuality', 'should', 'give', 'film', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'last', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'do', 'believe', 'worthy', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'Also', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'are', 'excellent', 'excepting', 'silly', 'Oz', 'set.This', 'definitely', 'rental', 'would', 'not', 'purchase', 'flick', 'was', 'die-hard', 'Spielberg', 'Cruise', 'fan', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'see', 'aliens', 'man', 'go', 'toe-to-toe', 'watch', 'ID4', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'intelligent', 'flick', 'least', 'kick', 'little', 'more', 'butt', 'dud']",N/A
635298,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNTI,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 4]","H.G. Wells' novel War of the Worlds is remarkably good, at least that is how I remembered it when I read it about 20 years ago.  Steven Spielberg's adaptation did not reach the heights that the novel did for me when I read it under the blanket with the help of a flickering flashlight.  My dear mother had told me that the book would give me nightmares, and I should read it during the day.  Despite what my mother said, I could not put the book down until I was done in the early dawn.  My personal experiences with the novel might have influenced my personal judgment of the film by Spielberg, whose films I have frequently revisited for both entertainment and study.  Nonetheless, I do not want to say it is a bad film by all means as it has its moments.Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), a dock worker and a neglectful father, faces the dilemma of having distrusting children while earth is being rapidly taken over by aliens.  It all begins with a strange electrical storm that begins to brew in the Ukraine the day before, but Ray does not pay attention to what is going on in other parts in the world.  However, when an electrical storm begins to develop in his backyard it begins to get serious - deadly serious.Ray steals a car while dealing with his own panic.  His children Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning) follow him, but are clueless of what is about to happen.  Rachel suffers from heavy anxiety, which Ray must deal with and Robbie is in the middle of his adolescence trying to prove himself as an adult.  Both situations with the the children are very problematic for an egocentrical person such a Ray, but he must find a way to deal with these trivial issues in the light of being hunted by monstrous tripod robots the size of skyscraper.Their escape turns to a road movie of sorts with a heavy touch of science fiction and contemporary social issues.  The science fictions scenes offer big time CGI that displays grand battle and destruction scenes.  In between these spectacular action scenes there are family issues to be dealt with while avoiding panic stricken people that might do something undesirable.  Even though terrorism is a very serious topic there are also some entertaining references to terrorism.War of the Worlds touches so many aspects of society and Spielberg touches them all.  However, it also feels somewhat forced and rushed, as the film clocks in under two hours, which means a lot of information has to get into these two hours.  The story does not reach its full potential in regards to action, suspense, drama, moral and intellectual stimuli.  Instead it feels like a mutation of Independence Day (1996) and Signs (2002) without the element of surprise that M. Night Shyamalan provides.  Many of Spielberg's films offer the infamous happy ending where everything is neatly packaged, which is one of the qualities that I admire about Spielberg.  In War of the World where things were supposed to be bad, really bad, this happiness seems to linger with a slight touch and makes it feel a little too pleasant in the end.Thus, when I look back 20 years and reflect over the many different films that I have seen and books I have read, I realize that the night I spent under the covers with H.G. Wells' novel is far from some of the more horrific films and books that I have come across.  However, it is a nostalgic memory that returned when I first heard about the film.  I wish that this the film could repeat the initial experience that I had with War of the Worlds.",3,"Visually Stunning, Yet Nostalgic Absence in H.G.

635300,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B00005JNTI,King of Controversy,"[1, 5]","War of the Worlds was an amazing movie. Not sure it was going for 'horror' but it was very scary. I was more frightened the second time I watched it. I wanted to be afraid - suspending my disbelief or whatever. I was so scared even the dog got scared and he wasn't watching the movie. It seemed as though the budget ran out 3/4ths of the way thru the movie and it kind of petered out. The only scene that I thought was kind of fake was the crashed airplane in the neighborhood - funny - turns out it was a real plane and the set became a tourist attraction you could visit out in California.It was Spielberg, when the main character pockets a gun from the house you just know it's going to figure in. Doesn't take long. He doesn't pull it when his friend decides not to get in the escape van. Then there's the guy ripping apart their windshield with his bare hands. Does he even eat some of the glass?Ray, the main character does wrong but ends up being a hero in the end.The scene in the basement farmhouse was interesting. At least one of my friends felt it was unnecessary. It embarrassed the crazy guy, perhaps. Ray is forced to kill the guy in the hopes of avoiding detection. Ray is in for a shock afterward when sees what the aliens have in store. Those without hope left are right. The crazy guy was even right. . . their only real chance was in killing the aliens, maybe even taking over their ship or whatever? I'm sure there are those who disagree. When I watched War of the Worlds a second time I noticed that, when the door creeks shut behind Ray after he's dispatched the tunneler, it makes the same sound the alien ships make.For just some useless information. . . I didn't notice it right away, but I wonder if the crazy guy in the farmhouse was named after Sci Fi writer Harlan Ellison? He's named Harlan and a couple of times he talks like he might be a writer of some kind, ""you and me, we're not on the same page"" and ""i'm dead set on living"". Who says Spielberg never adds a personal touch?I should probably not notice, but. . . of those who've reviewed this movie, many said the same thing: the original movie was 'great' and this one isn't as good.

Wells or the earlier 1950's film version, this summer blockbuster will always come in second.  Lacking the former's intelligence and completeness or the latter's updated inventiveness and spiritual heart, this is still a movie that entertains and sometimes even amazes.  The SFX are, of course, outstanding and spectacular, and the alien Tripods are truly frightening mechanized monsters that are easy to believe capable of stomping all over Creation.  The various explosions, death-rays, and escapes are all expertly handled (if not necessarily credibly so) and Tom Cruise does a good job in his role as a rather weatherbeaten and initially wholly unlikeable dad trying to protect his kids.  Nakota Fanning is believable as Cruise's terrified daughter and their evolving relationship is developed with some genuine sympathy and realism.  The conclusion shouldn't be a shock to anyone familiar with any of the story's previous incarnations, but I am inclined to agree with some who feel it comes about a bit too quickly after so much desperate action. Another weak point is Tim Robbins as the crazy survivalist.  Robbins' part actually combines at least three different characters from the Wells' book (his namesake Ogilvy, the Curate, and the Artilleryman) and his dialogue is about as discombobulated as would be expected from such an amalgamation.

635303,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B00005JNTI,Kona,"[2, 2]","Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" really delivers as an action/thriller.  Tom Cruise stars as Ray, a divorced father of two who has the kids for the weekend when Earth is invaded by killer aliens.  Huge mechanical ""tripods,""  buried for millions of years, rise out of the ground and start destroying everything in sight. Ray and the kids run for their lives only to find that no place is safe from these monsters and their huge tentacles.The special effects are wonderful:  Cities are flattened, cars are tossed in the air, a ferry boat is overturned, and it's all completely believable.  Combined with the excellent John Williams score, the effects are so intense that I often found myself holding my breath, eyes wide open, flattened against the back of my chair.  The action scenes alternate with dramatic bits of Ray trying to save his rebellious teenage son and terrified little daughter (Dakota Fanning).  This writing was corny and predictable, and some plot elements were unbelievable (for instance, Ray's car is the only one out of thousands that works), but I liked the alien invasion scenes so much that I can overlook them.This movie is genuinely scary, and fans of the 1953 version will enjoy seeing Gene Barry in a cameo.

635304,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B00005JNTI,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[3, 4]","Between Dakota Fanning's incessant high-pitched screaming and Tom Cruise's hyperactive nonstop running from pillar to post, I began to wish the aliens would win in this beautifully staged adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic sci-fi novel, WAR OF THE WORLDS. The fact that Cruise needed a sprinting coach and Dakota Fanning needed a shrieking coach for their characters doesn't add anything to the film. Both traits grate badly on the watching and listening audience.Steven Speilberg does his usual impeccable job of creating an alternative world onscreen, and the special effects are stunning, but WAR OF THE WORLDS never really captures the imagination in the manner which Wells did, or George Pal's 1953 film did.In part, the fault is Cruise's, who is just too fey and prim to carry off the role of the blue collar Everyman, Ray Ferrier, a crane operator. Ferrier is a role that cries out for ruggedness. Cruise may be many things, but he is no one's idea of rugged.In part, the fault is the screenwriters' who have insisted on including a ridiculous non-Wellsian subplot about Cruise's family problems with his rebellious teenaged son. While World War 97 is raging all around us, we are given time outs for dysfunctional family dynamics. It's difficult to listen to a shouting match about how ""you never loved us"" while Manhattan is being vaporized as a backdrop. Such things just wouldn't happen under the circumstances, and if they did they'd be solved with a bash in the chops from Dad, not a tearful tremble-jawed snit from a man who looks barely older than his son.This version of WAR OF THE WORLDS postulates that the Martians had previously visited Earth millions of years ago to bury their war machines underground in preparation for the big day. This is problematical. First, why not just seize Earth at that point without the worry of humanity battling back? They've come all that way, anyway. Second, why haven't we humans discovered these alien craft over time as we've dug tunnels, mines, or just holes in the back yard? Third, if the Martians did come to Earth in One Hundred Million B.C., how did they survive exposure to Earthly diseases (the classic ending) then? If the Martians have neutralized everything electrical, then why does every piece of human technology fail to operate except when it doesn't? Cruise drives away from all the destruction while others trudge, videocams work at moments when directorial off-shots add to the intensity of a scene, and fighter jets fly in battles even though airliners drop out of the sky like hunted ducks.  The film never addresses any of these contradictions, instead allowing its internal reality to collapse. It's a shocking shortfall for a Speilberg film. In short, the story is weak. But Wells' tale most certainly is not.In sum, WAR OF THE WORLDS is a classic story that deserves a much better treatment.",2,"""The littlest things on God's green earth.""",1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2871,"['Between', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'incessant', 'high-pitched', 'screaming', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'hyperactive', 'nonstop', 'running', 'pillar', 'post', 'began', 'wish', 'aliens', 'would', 'win', 'beautifully', 'staged', 'adaptation', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'novel', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'fact', 'Cruise', 'needed', 'sprinting', 'coach', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'needed', 'shrieking', 'coach', 'characters', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'film', 'traits', 'grate', 'badly', 'watching', 'listening', 'audience.Steven', 'Speilberg', 'usual', 'impeccable', 'job', 'creating', 'alternative', 'world', 'onscreen', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'stunning', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'never', 'really', 'imagination', 'manner', 'Wells', 'did', 'George', 'Pal', '1953', 'film', 'did.In', 'part', 'fault', 'Cruise', 'who', 'just', 'too', 'fey', 'prim', 'carry', 'off', 'role', 'blue', 'collar', 'Everyman', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'crane', 'operator', 'Ferrier', 'role', 'out', 'ruggedness', 'Cruise', 'may', 'be', 'many', 'things', 'one', 'idea', 'rugged.In', 'part', 'fault', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'have', 'insisted', 'including', 'ridiculous', 'non-Wellsian', 'subplot', 'Cruise', 'family', 'problems', 'rebellious', 'teenaged', 'son', 'World', 'War', '97', 'raging', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'outs', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'dynamics', 'difficult', 'listen', 'shouting', 'match', 'how', 'never', 'loved', 'Manhattan', 'being', 'vaporized', 'backdrop', 'Such', 'things', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'circumstances', 'did', ""'d"", 'be', 'solved', 'bash', 'chops', 'Dad', 'not', 'tearful', 'tremble-jawed', 'snit', 'man', 'who', 'barely', 'older', 'son.This', 'version', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'Martians', 'had', 'previously', 'visited', 'Earth', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'bury', 'war', 'machines', 'preparation', 'big', 'day', 'problematical', 'First', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'seize', 'Earth', 'point', 'worry', 'humanity', 'battling', 'back', ""'ve"", 'come', 'way', 'anyway', 'Second', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'humans', 'discovered', 'alien', 'craft', 'over', 'time', ""'ve"", 'dug', 'tunnels', 'mines', 'just', 'holes', 'back', 'yard', 'Third', 'Martians', 'did', 'come', 'Earth', 'One', 'Hundred', 'Million', 'B.C.', 'how', 'did', 'survive', 'exposure', 'Earthly', 'diseases', 'classic', 'ending', 'then', 'Martians', 'have', 'neutralized', 'everything', 'electrical', 'then', 'why', 'piece', 'human', 'technology', 'fail', 'operate', 'when', ""n't"", 'Cruise', 'away', 'destruction', 'others', 'trudge', 'videocams', 'work', 'moments', 'when', 'directorial', 'off-shots', 'add', 'intensity', 'scene', 'fighter', 'jets', 'fly', 'battles', 'even', 'airliners', 'drop', 'sky', 'hunted', 'ducks', 'film', 'never', 'contradictions', 'instead', 'allowing', 'internal', 'reality', 'collapse', 'shocking', 'shortfall', 'Speilberg', 'film', 'short', 'story', 'weak', 'Wells', 'tale', 'most', 'certainly', 'not.In', 'sum', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'classic', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'treatment']",N/A

Reynolds,"[0, 6]","I recently watched War of the Worlds, and I now wish that I had those 2 hours of my life back, so that I could have done something more constructive with my time.Wow, where do I start. Cruise (Ray) is a blue-collar, gearheaded, irresponsible dad, who is forced to finally grow up due to the extreme events of aliens attacking. Throughout the movie's entirety Cruise is assailing the aliens and there's no war or no true visible fight. I've never witnessed a Spielberg film with this many flaws but I'll attempt to list some of the movie's major mistakes.Ok Ray's a huge auto gearhead, and I'll give him credit. He figures out how to flip the car's starter to get it to function. But why hasn't anyone else figured this out. Is Ray the only mechanic in the Northern Hemisphere?Due to the electromagnetic lightning all machines that function with electricity malfunction; this includes cars, planes, and all electrical outlets/sources. So how is the news lady able to operate a VCR in her news van to show Tom Cruise footage of all of the terror? Why is the news van functional?All of the military Hummers, Helicopters, and Airplanes are all magically functional.A passenger airplane looses power and crashes into Ray's ex-wife's house, where Ray and the kids are safely secured in the basement. The next morning Ray ventures out to view the damage and their magical minivan is parked right next to the wreckage unscratched.Ray and the Kid's drive for hundreds of miles on back roads through upstate New York without having to refill the gas tank. Wow, maybe there were some excess gasoline tanks stored in the back of the van.Why are the people standing around watching a huge alien tripod emerge from the ground in amazement like it's some sort of 4th of July firework display??? In a real world everyone would have been running the 40yd dash as soon as the concrete began to crack.Ray's son Robbie loves his sister (Dakota Fanning) to the utmost and acts as if he is her guardian and protector. Why is it that all of a sudden he decides to rebel and leave his sister behind to join the National Guard to assist in fighting the aliens? Soon as he stumbles over the hill to engage in fighting back, a colossal explosion relative to a nuclear warhead destroys almost everything in its path on the other side of the hill. Guess what, we later find out at the end of the movie that Robbie makes it up to Boston to reunite with his mother, Ray, and her family. Why is the skyline of Boston up in flames, but Ray's ex wife's parents home as well as their entire  Boston block unscathed?What is the point of Tim Robbins' character? Why does he only offer the shelter of his cellar to Ray and his daughter and no one else running from the terror? Is Tim Robbins a sadistic child molester, a true patriot, or a schitzo??? We'll never know. But Cruise somehow kills him with his bare hands like he's Davey Crockett, but what's so funny is that Robbins has a shotgun and shovel with him when Cruise decides to exterminate him.The aliens begin to mal-function, weaken, and die due to the germs, bacteria, and common diseases that humans and animals have built resistances to over thousands of years. This is intriguing and very believable but not the way a film entitled ""War of The Worlds"" should end. Ironically there's no war whatsoever. We're basically forced fed a cheesy soap opera with a weak, predictable plot that's engrossed in above average special effects.This movie is so weak,,, it makes Pearl Harbor look like ""Apocalypse Now"".",1,"Spielberg, You're Better Than This.",1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,3530,"['recently', 'watched', 'War', 'Worlds', 'now', 'wish', 'had', '2', 'hours', 'life', 'back', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'more', 'constructive', 'time.Wow', 'where', 'do', 'start', 'Cruise', 'Ray', 'blue-collar', 'gearheaded', 'irresponsible', 'dad', 'who', 'forced', 'finally', 'grow', 'up', 'due', 'extreme', 'events', 'aliens', 'attacking', 'movie', 'entirety', 'Cruise', 'assailing', 'aliens', 'war', 'true', 'visible', 'fight', ""'ve"", 'never', 'witnessed', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'many', 'flaws', ""'ll"", 'attempt', 'list', 'movie', 'major', 'mistakes.Ok', 'Ray', 'huge', 'auto', 'gearhead', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit', 'out', 'how', 'flip', 'car', 'starter', 'get', 'function', 'why', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'else', 'figured', 'out', 'Ray', 'only', 'mechanic', 'Northern', 'Hemisphere', 'Due', 'electromagnetic', 'lightning', 'machines', 'function', 'electricity', 'malfunction', 'cars', 'planes', 'electrical', 'outlets/sources', 'So', 'how', 'news', 'lady', 'able', 'operate', 'VCR', 'news', 'van', 'show', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'footage', 'terror', 'Why', 'news', 'van', 'functional', 'military', 'Hummers', 'Helicopters', 'Airplanes', 'are', 'magically', 'functional.A', 'passenger', 'airplane', 'power', 'crashes', 'Ray', 'ex-wife', 'house', 'where', 'Ray', 'kids', 'are', 'safely', 'secured', 'basement', 'next', 'morning', 'Ray', 'ventures', 'out', 'view', 'damage', 'magical', 'minivan', 'parked', 'right', 'next', 'wreckage', 'unscratched.Ray', 'Kid', 'drive', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'back', 'roads', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'having', 'refill', 'gas', 'tank', 'Wow', 'maybe', 'were', 'excess', 'gasoline', 'tanks', 'stored', 'back', 'van.Why', 'are', 'people', 'standing', 'around', 'watching', 'huge', 'alien', 'tripod', 'emerge', 'ground', 'amazement', 'sort', '4th', 'July', 'firework', 'display', 'real', 'world', 'everyone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'running', '40yd', 'dash', 'as', 'soon', 'concrete', 'began', 'crack.Ray', 'son', 'Robbie', 'sister', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'utmost', 'acts', 'guardian', 'protector', 'Why', 'sudden', 'rebel', 'leave', 'sister', 'join', 'National', 'Guard', 'assist', 'fighting', 'aliens', 'Soon', 'hill', 'engage', 'fighting', 'back', 'colossal', 'explosion', 'relative', 'nuclear', 'warhead', 'almost', 'everything', 'path', 'other', 'side', 'hill', 'Guess', 'what', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'end', 'movie', 'Robbie', 'up', 'Boston', 'reunite', 'mother', 'Ray', 'family', 'Why', 'skyline', 'Boston', 'up', 'flames', 'Ray', 'ex', 'wife', 'parents', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'entire', 'Boston', 'block', 'unscathed', 'What', 'point', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'Why', 'only', 'offer', 'shelter', 'cellar', 'Ray', 'daughter', 'one', 'else', 'running', 'terror', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'sadistic', 'child', 'molester', 'true', 'patriot', 'schitzo', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'Cruise', 'somehow', 'bare', 'hands', 'Davey', 'Crockett', 'what', 'so', 'funny', 'Robbins', 'shotgun', 'shovel', 'when', 'Cruise', 'exterminate', 'him.The', 'aliens', 'begin', 'mal-function', 'weaken', 'die', 'due', 'germs', 'bacteria', 'common', 'diseases', 'humans', 'animals', 'have', 'built', 'resistances', 'thousands', 'years', 'intriguing', 'very', 'believable', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'entitled', 'War', 'Worlds', 'should', 'end', 'Ironically', 'war', 'whatsoever', ""'re"", 'basically', 'forced', 'fed', 'cheesy', 'soap', 'opera', 'weak', 'predictable', 'plot', 'engrossed', 'above', 'average', 'special', 'effects.This', 'movie', 'so', 'weak', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'look', 'Apocalypse', 'Now']",N/A

Ross ""Kristy""","[8, 10]","Steven Spielberg is my favorite director, and he always will be, but that doesn't mean that I can't watch his films objectively, for example, DUEL, JAWS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM THE COLOR PURPLE, EMPIRE OF THE SUN, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, JURASSIC PARK, SCHINDLER'S LIST, AMISTAD, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT are some of the greatest action/adventure/science fiction/drama films in motion picture history. But 1941, HOOK and The LOST WORLD are sub-par. But WAR OF THE WORLDS in unlike anything I have ever seen, boasting not only fantastic SFX from Industrial Light and Magic, but also an excellent performance from the most popular actor in the world, Tom Cruise. This is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's best movies, showcasing his fantastic filmmaking talent. This goes beyond the original film in terms of action-packed excitement and emotion. Miranda Otto gives strong support as well. Other secondary characters are played to perfection by fine A-list actors like Tim Robbins, Justin Chatwin, Robbie Ferrier, Dakota Fanning (TV's TAKEN) and James DuMont. And John William's score? The maestro has done it again; this is the Mercedes of music, the pinnacle of perfection, possibly the best, and most Oscar-worthy soundtrack for any film ever. Janusz Kaminski's stunning cinematography is a technical highlight, and Michael Kahn's sharp editing has served the famous director for almost 30 years. Rick Carter's astonishing production design is the films' biggest payoff, with mind-blowing epic scale mayhem. This is an interesting slant for Spielberg- be warned, this is no kid-friendly E.T heart-warmer. These aliens are seriously angry, and thankfully WOTW doesn't conjure up any memories of the jingoistic fluff of INDEPENDANCE DAY. The first 20 minutes is especially impressive, racking up the tension. And that ending, wow. That is incredible!

I couldn't put my finger on the theme, is it absentee dads, bad marriages, angry pre-teens/teens, terrorism, germ warfare, buy hybrid SUV's, war or just mindless spectacle.  After trying to figure it out, I decided that there was nothing to figure out.  This film is just pure spectacle and it excels in that.  The story is very decrepit now considering Wells penned it around 1890 and it was adapted better in the 1950's original film.  This version is fantastic in setting up it's scenes and milking the terror for all it's worth.  The special effects were amazing.The performances were passable.  But what struck me with amazement is that Spielberg has been trying to clone Drew Barrymore's performance in ET.  Every movie Spielberg has done with child actors have been suffused with Barrymore mannerisms.  But none of the child actors since Barrymore have had her charm or ability.  Drew Barrymore is the real McCoy from a long dynastic acting family.  I am surprised that Spielberg hasn't realized this fact.  Dakota Fanning annoyed me with her screeching thru the whole film.  But what annoyed me even more was that Fanning was set up tick by tick, costume, hairstyle and elocution to be Barrymore's Gertie.  She is not the same and the more I was encouraged to see the parallels the more I noticed the lack.  If Spielberg was and is so impressed with Barrymore's talent, why not cast the original?  Barrymore is always fun to watch and she would have been great in Tom Cruise's role.  In fact a blue collar mom would have been a heck more believable than Tom's character.  I don't have alot to say about Tom except that he has now perfected his smile to fit all situations.  Tom has his nervous smile, his angry smile, his scared smile and so on.  Also it was a sin to cast Miranda Otto (LOTR's Eowyn) and not give her anything to do.Other than that, Spielberg rips off his earlier landmark films with happy abandon.  He stumbles at the end with the inevitable happy ending.  Luckily this time, he doesn't linger on the unbearable ridiculousness of it all.At the end of the day, see this for WOW factor but not much else.",3,Entertaining Summer Movie and nothing more...,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,2249,"['surprising', 'say', 'Lucas', 'Revenge', 'Sith', 'had', 'deeper', 'issues', 'head', 'Spielberg', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'theme', 'absentee', 'dads', 'bad', 'marriages', 'angry', 'pre-teens/teens', 'terrorism', 'germ', 'warfare', 'buy', 'hybrid', 'SUV', 'war', 'just', 'mindless', 'spectacle', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'decided', 'was', 'nothing', 'figure', 'out', 'film', 'just', 'pure', 'spectacle', 'story', 'very', 'decrepit', 'now', 'considering', 'Wells', 'penned', '1890', 'was', 'adapted', 'better', '1950', 'original', 'film', 'version', 'fantastic', 'setting', 'up', 'scenes', 'milking', 'terror', 'worth', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing.The', 'performances', 'were', 'passable', 'what', 'struck', 'amazement', 'Spielberg', 'been', 'trying', 'clone', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'performance', 'ET', 'Every', 'movie', 'Spielberg', 'done', 'child', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'suffused', 'Barrymore', 'mannerisms', 'none', 'child', 'actors', 'Barrymore', 'have', 'had', 'charm', 'ability', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'real', 'McCoy', 'long', 'dynastic', 'acting', 'family', 'am', 'surprised', 'Spielberg', ""n't"", 'realized', 'fact', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'annoyed', 'screeching', 'whole', 'film', 'what', 'annoyed', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'Fanning', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'tick', 'tick', 'costume', 'hairstyle', 'elocution', 'be', 'Barrymore', 'Gertie', 'not', 'same', 'more', 'was', 'encouraged', 'see', 'parallels', 'more', 'noticed', 'lack', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'Barrymore', 'talent', 'why', 'not', 'cast', 'original', 'Barrymore', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'role', 'fact', 'blue', 'collar', 'mom', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'heck', 'more', 'believable', 'Tom', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'alot', 'say', 'Tom', 'now', 'perfected', 'smile', 'fit', 'situations', 'Tom', 'nervous', 'smile', 'angry', 'smile', 'scared', 'smile', 'so', 'Also', 'was', 'sin', 'cast', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'LOTR', 'Eowyn', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'do.Other', 'Spielberg', 'earlier', 'landmark', 'films', 'happy', 'abandon', 'end', 'inevitable', 'happy', 'ending', 'Luckily', 'time', ""n't"", 'linger', 'unbearable', 'ridiculousness', 'end', 'day', 'see', 'WOW', 'factor', 'not', 'much', 'else']",N/A

When I came out, I felt as though Speilberg isn't really trying anymore.  Now, before you ding me because I gave it three stars, hear me out; I thought some of it was pretty good.First off, I'm not a real Tom Cruise fan so I am somewhat bias.  I just get the feeling that every Tom Cruise movie is nothing but a Tom Cruise movie save for Top Gun.  I felt as though he tried to steal the show waaay more then he should since there were few moments where the camera was not on Tom Cruise, it just felt like a me, me, me moment.I can remember in the theatre at one part, where Tom Cruise's character is making a speech to his son on a hill, the battle going on below, Cruise really tried to have a dramatic moment with his son.  Somewhere in the theatre someone yawned loudly, I didn't know if it was intentional or not but the audience slowly started to crack, then burst out laughing.  The point is that Cruise was almost over the top, the true star of the show was Dakota Fanning, who is the female equivilent to Haley Joel.Tim Robbins was flat-out creepy and did a darn good job of it.  It was certainly not a role you would expect him to play; I half-way expected him to be president when I saw his name on the poster.  Kudos to Robbins.The story dragged on waaay longer then it should.  The whole story was focused around Cruise with little to no subplots, so the movies was extremely linear, which I find to be lazy.  In the original there was quite a slew of subplots, keeping the audience somewhat interested in watching more, which is the point of subplots.  In the new one, there are practically none, which makes the movie somewhat boring.The special effects are one of the few pluses; they were quite spactacular with the vaporzing humans and the ""tripods.""  I was quite impressed, but felt as though there was significantly less special effects then most movies since the movie was primarily focused on Cruise.Lastly, there were no real improvements to the original script, save for the aliens using... oh, can't spoil the movie but there's a marginal plot-twist that makes the aliens somewhat more creepy, but almost makes the movie a zombie movie in terms of creepiness.  It doesn't seem as though Speilberg really tried to improve anything with the exception of the special effects.All in all, this was an ok movie.  The kind that I wouldn't mind seeing again as long as a friend rents or buys it; I really don't feel like adding this to my collection.

It is a remake of the famous 1939 radio broadcast and the still marvelous film from the 1950s with, unfortuantely, the same copout ending.Tom Cruise and a few other famouse actos lend their names and skills to this near duplicate re-creation of the Gene Barry version with hardly anything new that isn't the result of superior new millennium technology.The invaders, who apparently were here all the time, not coming from outer space, look more realisitic in the tripod machines. The one scene where you see the invaders looks more realistic, although it is created in such darkness as to be film noir. And the war scenes between the invaders and us poor humans are pretty good, although a lot of fire and explosions tends to get in the way of whatever is going on.Probably the best part is the  relative scale of the invaders' tripods, as they appear to be 50-75 feet tall against the backdrop of us tiny humans, our abodes and our popgun military might, which can't seem to do a thing to the bad guys.All seems lost when Tim Robbins says it's not a war, ""it's an extermination,"" after which you know the tide is going to turn because you've seen it all before. The tide does turn and, poof, the invaders get a bug that kills them en masse with no more explanation of how this all happened simultaneously in 2005 as it did in 1953 and 1939!So here's a thrilling visual story of events that have been played out a couple times before with the same results.

Bernabo,"[1, 2]","""No one would believe in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water....Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us....""Of course Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" begins with the words of the first paragraph of H.G. Wells's 1898 novel, solemnly intoned by Morgan Freeman. Howard Koch invoked those same words for Orson Welles to read at the beginning of the infamous Mercury Theater on the Air broadcast of October 30, 1938. This is the first significant alien invasion story and in many ways it remains the best because it defines the essence of the genre: alien invaders want what we have and have come to take it away from us.  Spielberg goes back to the basics: the aliens arrive and start exterminating the locals. There is never an explicit notion that these aliens are from Mars, and while we can piece together what the aliens are up to there is never a point where a character fills in the gaps of the narrative exposition (there is a point where you would think the characters would turn on a television to try and find out what is going on, but they never even consider doing it). Rumors abound, but facts are in short supply. There is a war going on, but it is taking place on the other side of the next hill. There are millions of people being killed by the machines (a fact reinforced by the almost constant sound of them throughout the film), but the carnage is effectively suggested indirectly because Spielberg wants to show and not tell.Although this film is told on the periphery of the war, Spielberg places the characters on the edge of the invasion, where whatever is happening is almost always happening at Tom Cruise's heels, although sometimes it happens right in front of his nose. Unlike the 1953 film the hero of this film is not a scientist caught in the middle of the desperate attempt to stop the Martians from destroying California. Ray Ferrier (Cruise) works a crane on a loading dock, and if you are waiting for his occupation to come into play at some point in this film forget about it. After all, most of us know that this one has to end with a whimper rather than a bang, which is why the screenplay by Josh Friedman and David Koepp has to create a small but necessary moral victory. However, in that regard what matters is not the destruction of a single machine, but rather the idea that there are human beings who will not stop fighting and who will make an effort to help save others in the midst of panic.A lot of Spielberg's films are about fathers and sons, albeit usually absent fathers and their symbolic replacements. The family situation in ""War of the Worlds"" is that Ray has hi two kids, Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning), for the weekend while his ex-wife and her current husband head up to Boston to visit her parents (which is how Gene Barry gets his cameo appearance). I guess protecting your children from alien invaders is one way of proving yourself to be a good parent, but such family problems do not seem to amount to a hill of beans in a crazy world where tripods are killing people with death rays. But we know such elements resonate with Spielberg (and with us when we see the fear on Rachel's face and hear her scream), just as we know that it is necessary for Ray to be able to drive through the magic lane available on the highway or over the wreckage of a downed airliner to be able to advance the stories. Besides, there is a telling payoff to the whole car idea, which is how the movie shifts from bad to worse.With regards to previous tellings of the tale what makes this one stand out is how much of it is the rural area of New England, which makes it much more like Grovers Mill than a great metropolis like New York City or London. This gives a much different spin to the words of Ogilvy (Tim Robbins), the incarnation of the man on Putney Hill from the novel, since surviving in the bowels of a city would be a lot easier than fighting back from the cellar of a farm house somewhere in Massachusetts. Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" is not about winning the war but just surviving. That is why choosing to remake this movie as taking place on the periphery of the invasion makes sense. We know how this war is going to end, but that does not making staying alive any easier for the characters.",5,Spielberg puts us on the edge of an alien invasion,1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,4835,"['one', 'would', 'believe', 'last', 'years', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'world', 'was', 'being', 'watched', 'keenly', 'closely', 'intelligences', 'greater', 'man', 'yet', 'as', 'mortal', 'own', 'men', 'busied', 'various', 'concerns', 'were', 'scrutinized', 'studied', 'perhaps', 'almost', 'as', 'narrowly', 'man', 'microscope', 'might', 'scrutinize', 'transient', 'swarm', 'multiply', 'drop', 'water', 'gulf', 'space', 'minds', 'are', 'minds', 'ours', 'are', 'beasts', 'perish', 'intellects', 'vast', 'cool', 'unsympathetic', 'regarded', 'earth', 'envious', 'eyes', 'slowly', 'surely', 'drew', 'plans', 'course', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'words', 'first', 'paragraph', 'H.G', 'Wells', '1898', 'novel', 'solemnly', 'intoned', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Howard', 'Koch', 'invoked', 'same', 'words', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'read', 'beginning', 'infamous', 'Mercury', 'Theater', 'Air', 'broadcast', 'October', '30', '1938', 'first', 'significant', 'alien', 'invasion', 'story', 'many', 'ways', 'best', 'essence', 'genre', 'alien', 'invaders', 'want', 'what', 'have', 'have', 'come', 'take', 'away', 'Spielberg', 'back', 'basics', 'aliens', 'arrive', 'start', 'exterminating', 'locals', 'never', 'explicit', 'notion', 'aliens', 'are', 'Mars', 'can', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'aliens', 'are', 'up', 'never', 'point', 'where', 'character', 'gaps', 'narrative', 'exposition', 'point', 'where', 'would', 'think', 'characters', 'would', 'turn', 'television', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'never', 'even', 'consider', 'doing', 'Rumors', 'facts', 'are', 'short', 'supply', 'war', 'going', 'taking', 'place', 'other', 'side', 'next', 'hill', 'are', 'millions', 'people', 'being', 'killed', 'machines', 'fact', 'reinforced', 'almost', 'constant', 'sound', 'film', 'carnage', 'effectively', 'suggested', 'indirectly', 'Spielberg', 'show', 'not', 'film', 'told', 'periphery', 'war', 'Spielberg', 'characters', 'edge', 'invasion', 'where', 'whatever', 'happening', 'almost', 'always', 'happening', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'heels', 'sometimes', 'right', 'front', 'nose', '1953', 'film', 'hero', 'film', 'not', 'scientist', 'caught', 'middle', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'stop', 'Martians', 'destroying', 'California', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'Cruise', 'crane', 'loading', 'dock', 'are', 'waiting', 'occupation', 'come', 'play', 'point', 'film', 'forget', 'most', 'know', 'one', 'end', 'whimper', 'rather', 'bang', 'why', 'screenplay', 'Josh', 'Friedman', 'David', 'Koepp', 'create', 'small', 'necessary', 'moral', 'victory', 'However', 'regard', 'what', 'not', 'destruction', 'single', 'machine', 'rather', 'idea', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'fighting', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'effort', 'help', 'save', 'others', 'midst', 'panic.A', 'lot', 'Spielberg', 'films', 'are', 'fathers', 'sons', 'usually', 'absent', 'fathers', 'symbolic', 'replacements', 'family', 'situation', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Ray', 'hi', 'two', 'kids', 'Robbie', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'Rachel', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'weekend', 'ex-wife', 'current', 'husband', 'head', 'Boston', 'visit', 'parents', 'how', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'guess', 'protecting', 'children', 'alien', 'invaders', 'one', 'way', 'proving', 'be', 'good', 'parent', 'such', 'family', 'problems', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'amount', 'hill', 'beans', 'crazy', 'world', 'where', 'tripods', 'are', 'killing', 'people', 'death', 'rays', 'know', 'such', 'elements', 'resonate', 'Spielberg', 'when', 'see', 'fear', 'Rachel', 'face', 'hear', 'scream', 'just', 'know', 'necessary', 'Ray', 'be', 'able', 'drive', 'magic', 'lane', 'available', 'highway', 'wreckage', 'downed', 'airliner', 'be', 'able', 'advance', 'stories', 'telling', 'payoff', 'whole', 'car', 'idea', 'how', 'movie', 'shifts', 'bad', 'worse.With', 'regards', 'previous', 'tellings', 'tale', 'what', 'one', 'stand', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'rural', 'area', 'New', 'England', 'much', 'more', 'Grovers', 'Mill', 'great', 'metropolis', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'London', 'much', 'different', 'spin', 'words', 'Ogilvy', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'incarnation', 'man', 'Putney', 'Hill', 'novel', 'surviving', 'bowels', 'city', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'easier', 'fighting', 'back', 'cellar', 'farm', 'house', 'somewhere', 'Massachusetts', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'not', 'winning', 'war', 'just', 'surviving', 'why', 'choosing', 'remake', 'movie', 'taking', 'place', 'periphery', 'invasion', 'sense', 'know', 'how', 'war', 'going', 'end', 'not', 'making', 'staying', 'alive', 'easier', 'characters']",N/A
635317,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JNTI,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","I confess that I am a sucker for sci-fi flicks, and this adaptation of H. G. Wells' classic novel, which was first published in 1898 and often touted as the world's first published work of science fiction, is no exception. I simply loved this film and was riveted to the screen the entire time. Updated to reflect the world of today, the film does the book justice, maintaining the core of the story and keeping many of its moral imperatives at the forefront. Steven Spielberg definitely pulls out all the stops, rendering a first class, alien invasion film.When the film begins, the world is just as we know it. Our intrepid working class everyman, Ray Farrier (Tom Cruise), is a divorced, blue collar worker and an irresponsible father of two, who is estranged from his children, precocious pre-teen daughter, Rachel (Dakota Fanning), and rebellious teenage son, Robbie (Justin Chatwin). When his ex-wife (Miranda Otto) leaves their reluctant children with him for the weekend, while she and her current husband go and do some visiting in Boston, they all think that it is just another weekend. Little do they know that the world, as they know it, is about to change.What at first appears to be an unusual atmospheric weather condition, a series of electrical storms that seem to be peppering the world, soon reveals itself for what it really is, and weather has nothing to do with it. All electricity is suddenly sapped, cell phones stop working, cars drop dead in their tracks, and another unwanted weekend at Dad's place turns out to be something else altogether, as the world is plunged into total chaos. Ray is forced to think not only of himself but also of his children, for once, as they try to make sense of their new, incomprehensible reality and struggle to stay alive. The alien invasion is seen through the eyes of the Farriers as they flee, and the viewer knows only what they know of the events into which the world has suddenly been plunged. The film is grounded entirely in this context.This is an exciting film with spectacular special effects. Spielberg has outdone himself. Giant alien tripods traipse across the landscape, destroying everything in their path with their incinerating death rays. The concept of mercy never even enters the picture when the aliens come marching along, and the loud trumpeting sound that they make, heralding their presence, will chill the blood of even the most equanimous viewer. Resistance initially appears to be futile, as mankind's conventional warfare just does not do the trick when confronted with the superior technological capabilities of the aliens. The aliens' plans for the human race, which the alien invaders are hell bent on annihilating, are ghastly, and Ray Farrier is forced to grow up in a hurry and keep his head, while all around him others are losing theirs. During the ongoing maelstrom, the relationships between the three main protagonists undergo a change for the better, while the world undergoes a change for the worse.Tom Cruise, notwithstanding all his negative personal publicity of late, gives a marvelous performance, infusing his character with just the right amount of initial cock-of-the-walk insouciance. His swagger, however, quickly dissipates when faced with the surreality of his new circumstances. As disaster strikes, his character rises to the occasion, struggling to keep himself and his children alive amidst the chaos and carnage, while trying to make sense of the changing circumstances around them. It begins to dawn upon him how much his children mean to him, just when he is on the very verge of losing them. Cast out into a world that he no longer recognizes and given a clear purpose by his children, Ray is a man who is forced to do the unthinkable to ensure their survival. Tom makes the transition of the character from irresponsible to caring totally believable. Make no mistake, however, Ray is no superhero, and Tom Cruise maintains the everyman frailty of his character throughout the entire film.Dakota Fanning, as always, gives an excellent performance, infusing the role of the tormented Rachel with the right amount of angst and shock, but make no mistake, this is Tom Cruise's film all the way, and she fails to steal the show. Justin Chadwick also rises to the occasion as Bobbie, the irritating teenage son who wants to do things his way. Tim Robbins gives a compelling performance as Ogilvy, an ambulance driver in a pre-invasion world, who has seen his entire family annihilated by the alien invaders. Ogilvy is clearly a man on the edge of reason, who wants to destroy the aliens and get the better of them. As he is armed only with a shotgun and a shovel, however, his prospects do not look good. When he gives sanctuary in the basement of his home to a fleeing Ray and Rachel Farrier, he expects Ray to become a sort of resistance fighter to the death with him. Ray, however, sees things differently, as he still has something to live for: his children and their survival. This brings about an eventual conflict between the two with an unsettling and primal resolution.The film begins and ends with a voice over narration masterfully done by Morgan Freeman, whose mellifluous voice lends just the right note to the film. Coupled with a great story, really spectacular special effects, fine performances, and deft direction by Steven Spielberg, this film, despite its flawed final scene, has all the makings of a great sci-fi flick. It is a film worthy of being in one's personal collection.

At one point I turned to look at the faces in the audience and most of them literally had their jaws dropped. I decided to check out the look on the audience's faces after I caught myself looking in amazement at the action early in the film as the martians exploded out the ground. The only reason I do not give it 4 Stars is because I do not care at all for Tom Cruise or Anthony Robbins who both play key roles in the movie. Particularly Tom Cruise who I believe took away from the film. I do believe the story and the action totally make up for what I consider poor acting on the part of Cruise. In my opinion I believe an actor such as Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe or even Mark Wahlberg would have been much more suited for the title role. I give Dakota Fanning 5 Stars....She is a great little actor. Most anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi or Action films sould enjoy this movie. I could see it really had viewers on the edge of their seats including me. I think most viewers will be able to put their disdain for Tom Cruise aside and enjoy this film.

I did not want to see it again.I recently purchased the Pendragon WOTW on ebay for .49 cents and watched it. It has been thrashed to death here on Amazon, and rightly so, so I won't rehash any of the MANY flaws of that production here.I also recently heard of Pendragon's main man and creator of the 'authentic' WOTW mess, Timothy Hines, sueing Dark Horse comics for supposedly stealing Pendragon's visuals for a comic book wersion of the H.G. Wells classic story.I had never heard of Dark Horse, so I clicked-on to their website to see what all the fuss was about.Well, after seeing three unsucessful attempts to bring WOTW to life properly, I finally found the ideal visual rendition here.This story is so broad and wide ranging that no film maker has quite known where to put the best effort. I have read reports about the original 1953 George Pal film by people who actually worked on it who said that they very much wanted to use tripods in the film, but after many attempts to get something believeable, they abandoned the idea and went with the swan-thingie that appears in the film.

It seems an odd choice for Spielberg to revive the old Welles' story for his newest film epic, but it was a film worth seeing. However, it won't top ""Minority Report"" for creativity and long-lasting impressions. In this truly pessimistic science-fiction movie, we are saddled with the annoying and angry (okay, believable) characters of Tom Cruise and his dysfunctional family, and there is nothing like the world coming under alien invasion and attack to darken there already pitch-black moods. The film can almost be depressing, it's very dark in spots, and could also be a very frightening film experience, if only for the way people behave when they panic and the world loses control of the universe (as if it ever had a chance to be in control). Anyway, Spielberg has turned to sci-fi once again, and this movie ultimately feels rushed and protracted as a result of Steven's hectic work schedule in the past eight years. ""Saving Private Ryan"" will never be overshadowed, and neither will ""Close Encounters..."", but this surprising, upsetting, and modernistic movie may in time become a Spielberg (and even Cruise) favorite.

This is a great movie if you just want to stare at a screen and escape reality for a couple of hours.Even during the movie though, when I was trying not to think too much, I noticed stuff that made me wonder, like:Why is it that there were always these neat paths created throuth the chaos and the rubble whenever the hero needed to drive his last-remaining-operational minivan?Why were car parts on shelves not destroyed by EMP?  If the EMP fried the parts in all the cars, wouldn't it fry all the spare parts too?  Or, are the auto repair places in New York all shielded from EMP like military stuff is?Actually, EMP is bad for integrated circuits, so any car made before the 1970's should still work I would think.  All the yuppies with their new vehicles would be walking while rednecks and hot-rodders would be zooming past them in their old cars.How is it that a large airliner could crash next to a house, and there would be all this airliner wreckage around, but no bodies from the plane?  I looked for bodies and didn't see any.  But there was a nice path through the wreckage for the minivan to drive through.I also thought of scenes that would have been really cool that could have been adapted from the book but weren't.  Wouldn't it have been great if just as the alien machine was about to destroy the ferry, a navy destroyer showed up and rammed one of the legs of the tripod and brought it down before being destroyed by another tripod?  Then we'd have something like the scene with the HMS Thunderchild in the book.The ""occupations never work"" line was over the top.  Is that really true?  Did the US occupation of Japan and Germany not work?  Isn't the destruction of my country enough to watch without the no-so-subtle political propaganda?Finally, the son being there at the end was too much.  How could he possibly have survived?  Could he at least have explained that to us?So, it's a very entertaining movie that missed its chance to be great.

I thought this would be a perfect pairing of genre and actor for me. It's even based on a story by H. G. Welles, who was an amazing writer.First, I'll talk about what the movie did well. The effects were great. The snaky camera of the alien machines looked like the Abyss creatures, with a mechanical scaliness of a serpent. The family dynamics were done well. We have a distant father, a sullen teenage boy, a claustrophobic daughter, and a pregnant-mom-with-new-guy off in Boston. I realize that these movies have to make everyone insanely silly at the beginning of the story so that they can grow, mature and learn by the end.That being said, I watched the movie with my boyfriend and by the end there were a ton of issues we both had racked up on our list. First, while the general sound and soundtrack was great, including the great ""noises"" made by the aliens at various times, the screaming of Dakota Fanning drove me *completely insane*. One or two would have done well to be ""extreme"" moments for her. To have her screaming in every single screen made it repetitive and really annoying.The teen son was good in that he went from ""typical"" Hollywood sullen irresponsible kid to mature, take-action young man. That being said, just what was he doing during the climactic ""let me go"" scene with his dad? He just wanted to go *look* over the hill and his dad was refusing to let him? The argument seemed meaningless. Then to have the area blasted by fire immediately afterwards was far too quick for dramatic reasons.The movie seemed to be a tribute to mankind's stupidity - that surely we did not deserve to live and only the fact that virusses are around saved us. Nasty lightning is raining from the skies, and moms are taking infants out to see it. Gigantic monsters are climbing out of the ground, and crowds of humans push each other closer to see what they are like. Flaming death is over the hill - and everybody goes walking towards it to take a look. Even when the death machine crashes to the ground, Tom runs forward *with pre-teen in his arms* to be right next to it and look inside. Surely we have had many natural disasters in our own lifetime, and yes, some people are harsh. Many people, though, are helpful and risk their own lives to help each other! This view of mankind was incredibly harsh and in many cases unbelievable.Which brings me to the most questionable part - when Tom is invited in to a safe hideout by an ambulance worker. The worker talks with them, keeps them safe, is sharing his food and water. When the worker decides to try to tunnel to safety - which, to be honest, sounded like a good idea to me - Tom *slays him*. Why not go to another house? He was invited *in* to this place, and when he disagrees with the owner he kills the guy?? That bothered me a great deal.Now, for the aliens. We get the sense they came to Earth for the water, and that they'd had this plan in mind for maybe thousands of years. They don't want to *exterminate* all humans - they are using our blood. So this is more some sort of food chain situation, sort of like us raising chickens. We wouldn't want to kill all chickens, we want to round them up and breed them so they'd always be around. Also, it's not like they hate us! If they did, they would've wiped us out many years ago, when there were fewer of us. They find us useful. Heck, maybe they waited for us to irrigate the world more before stepping in to take over.Still, I found their wiping out humans one by one with the death rays to be a little silly. If their aim was to whittle us down to 10% of our population to keep for food, and wipe out the remaining 90%, surely such a vast intellect would have a better way to do that. Maybe they'd keep Australia and use poison gas on the rest of the population. Why would they go seeking out humans one by one to either kill them or eat them? Australia's an island. They could sweep up enough humans to meet their quota, drop them in Australia and then just do some sort of massive blast everywhere else. If there was a reason for this one-by-one pickoff, it would have been nice for them to show it somehow. Otherwise it seemed very silly.Speaking of silly, they did a giant EMT blast in New York. It took out cars, TVs, lights, house phone, cell phones, even watches. However, two seconds later, at the ""hole in the ground"", people are taking pictures with cameras and video cameras. Those were magical non-EMT-reactive devices? Hmmmmmmmmm.I am all for dark movies. I'm all for looking at the seedy side of live. However, I need a movie to have context and sense, intellectually, to be able to really lose myself in it and enjoy it. The plot holes in this one were just *gigantic* and, honestly, quite unnecessary. I could think of a hundred ways to have tweaked the movie to take care of the problems. It is amazing to me that Spielburg focussed so much on the special effects and flash in this movie, when he has shown elsewhere that he is *capable* of the actual plotline and characters, if he only cares enough to take the time.",3,Great Potential but Plot / Character Issues,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,5145,"[""'m"", 'great', 'fan', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'actually', 'Tom', 'Cruise',

Nasty aliens out to destory Planet Earth and its diverse human creatures. Familiarity of the theme also couple with the fact that War of the Worlds nasty aliens also got shielding to protect them from the inferior humans and even looked like ID4 aliens, especially their heads, you can't help but to compared the two movies.Having said, I can say that the special effects was pretty good, the acting was okay, unlike some of the previous reviewers, Dakota Fanning who played a little girl did a great job playing one. Frightened kids do a lot of stupid things and they do scream quite a bit. Tom Cruise does a creditable job as a irresponsible father type. His best moment came when he had to choose between his equally irresponsible son and his daughter who about to be taken by strangers who thought she was alone. That moment of choice was well done by Cruise.Unlike ID4 where people of Earth fought back through some outrageous means and won, in War of the Worlds, people of Earth were cattle flodder to the aliens. In some way, this was a long chase movie. Tom Cruise and kids being chased by aliens all the way from New York to Boston. Aliens' purpose to Earth remains unexplained and why they waited so long remains unexplained. After all, if they came out couple of hundred years ago, their conquest would be whole lot easier but then, we won't have a movie.Some of the previous reviewers stated that the ending was pretty bad. To be honest, it was very bad. Why Boston was spared while all other cities of the world was wasted remains unexplained. How that dumb kid survived when all others with him perished remains unexplained. In fact, the entire movie seem to be poorly scripted and developed, a funny trait for a Steven Speilberg movie. At least Morgan Freeman who narrated the beginning and the end of the movie, tells us that aliens died of bacterial infection like the book and the 1953 version. The ending leave me with the feeling ""so what"" as the credit rolls. At least in ID4, there was an inspired moment as humans gained victory over the aliens and it looked as rebuilding process may not be so bad after all. In War of the Worlds, it looked like the end of the world even after the aliens were dying.But it was entertaining while it lasted.

Whether all of these people actually saw the film is doubtful.  I'm not saying people don't have the right to criticize; hey, it's a free country.  But the reasons people give for not liking the film are often ridiculous.  Many call the film a dud citing Tom Cruise's off-screen behavior.  Others write off the whole film because they think machines on tripods are impractical and because they don't like other plot elements which came straight out of HG Well's pen... and which actually make the movie true to the author's vision.Of course this movie has flaws, all movies do, even great movies like this one.  The personal story surrounding Cruise and his kids is too thin and both kids are played by annoying actors cast in annoying roles.  The much vaunted Dakota Fanning is such a sophisticated ""little adult"" that I just couldn't buy it when she tried to convey a child's fright.Other than what I've mentioned, this movie is absolutely riveting; an unexpectedly nightmarish experience that keeps you glued to your seat from start to finish.  The scenes of the alien invaders devastating the countryside are like nothing you've ever seen before on film... darkly beautiful and incredibly creepy.  Though I don't care for Cruise as a public personality, I have to admit he was perfect here.  John Williams' score struck just the right notes of restraint and terror in all the right places.  And I've never heard sound used more effectively to frighten the heck out of the audience.By means of this movie, Speilberg proves that he is still one of the masters.  His movie doesn't just dazzle you with its special effects, it terrifies you with them. Any fan of the novel or the fifties movie will recognize how respectful Speilberg was to both of those works-- and even to the Orson Welles radio version.  He kept the best of all three and added his own holocaust-like vision of an alien attack.

As I left the theatre there was a large building crane off in the distance and I about jumped out of my shoes. Even now weeks later, when I hear an odd rumbling or machine noise, for just a split second I get scared. The sounds of the machines, I think, scared me more than I realized.I do reccomend this to anyone who enjoys scary movies.I have thought a great deal about how this film was made. For me to say I could have done a better job is ridiculous. But I do wonder if the film had been different, especially with a better lead actor besides Tom Cruise, if it could not have been made to be more than just a scary movie.Dakkota Fanning was the saving grace of this film. And I think it might well be Tom Cruise's best attempt at acting yet. It was interesting to me to see Cruise and Fanning so close to each other acting, and there little pre-teen Fanning was next to big Tom, and so obviously a better actor than Tom Cruise ever was or will be.",4,Scared the heck out of me,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,1029,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'lot', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'effected', 'left', 'theatre', 'was', 'large', 'building', 'crane', 'distance', 'about', 'jumped', 'shoes', 'Even', 'now', 'weeks', 'later', 'when', 'hear', 'odd', 'rumbling', 'machine', 'noise', 'just', 'split', 'second', 'get', 'scared', 'sounds', 'machines', 'think', 'scared', 'more', 'realized.I', 'do', 'reccomend', 'anyone', 'who', 'scary', 'movies.I', 'have', 'thought', 'great', 'deal', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'ridiculous', 'do', 'wonder', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'different', 'especially', 'better', 'lead', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'scary', 'movie.Dakkota', 'Fanning', 'was', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'think', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'best', 'attempt', 'acting', 'yet', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Cruise', 'Fanning', 'so', 'close', 'other', 'acting', 'there', 'little', 'pre-teen', 'Fanning', 'was', 'next', 'big', 'Tom', 'so', 'obviously', 'better', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'ever', 'was', 'will', 'be']",N/A
635343,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JNTI,magellan,"[2, 5]","I enjoyed this remake of the original, despite having a sort of nostalgia for Gene Barry's professorial role in the first one. Cruise wouldn't be the right actor to reprise a physics prof, so his role is different, but that's okay, Cruise does a fine job with his role as usual. And the manta-ray like ships in the first movie with their meson matter disintegration rays were possibly the coolest special effect ever in a sci-fi movie until several decades later when advanced digital effects came along. But the awesome tripods in this movie are more faithful to the original book, and so I give Spielberg credit for that. I think H.G. Wells would approve.(By the way, speaking of Gene Barry and the original flick, the old man on the porch in Boston is Gene Barry, the star of the original movie).I've read several of Wells's books but unfortunately have only read portions of this one, so I can't comment any further on how faithful it is to the original concept, but overall this seemed a dramatic, suspenseful, and scary rendition of the classic sci-fi book. The martian tripods are awesome, wreaking total destruction on everything in their path. From the moment the great machines start to move, there is no doubt that the human race is up against a malevolent and implaccable foe that is not simply waging a war against us, but is out to totally exterminate us the way we would some vermin.Whole books of literary criticism have been written on this and Wells's other books, but although a review of an action movie like this perhaps isn't the place for philosophical ruminations on the nature of good and evil, I found myself wondering if humans, considering their history, are really any better than the Martians. I mean, we had 50 million dead in just the major wars of the 20th century, not to mention the Holocaust, which was really no different from what the Martians are doing here.Let's put it this way: suppose certain countries or groups we all know about had overwhelmingly superior war machines like these. Is there any doubt in your mind that they would use them? In which case, what's so different about us compared to the way the evil Martians are portrayed here? The sad truth is that in 1 million years of pre-civilized evolution and history and 10,000 years of ""civilized"" existence (since the advent of agriculture and larger towns and cities) humans are still unable to live peaceably and to abolish war and mass killing.Well, I won't spend anymore time here ruminating on such abstract issues, since this really isn't the place for that. But it's a legitimate question given our own, well, unabashedly brutal and bloody history.But getting back to the movie, the ""death rays"" here are a little different from the original too, with a strange side effect of their own, but I won't say anything further so as not to spoil it for you, but well, it's a little macabre by itself, but Spielberg uses the horror of that to good effect by itself in several scenes.Some of the scenes are reprised almost exactly from the original, so I thought I would compare them a bit. One is where the military ground forces square off against the tripods and are soundly defeated. But the cool scene with the nuclear bomb drop from the flying wing isn't, that being replaced by a few fighters and helicopter gunships firing their missiles--which doesn't seem nearly as likely to succeed as a nuke, but oh well, it's still a good scene. At the end the tripod seems to loom right up out of the side of the hill where the battle takes place, using camera foreshortening to heighten the menacing effect of the gigantic tripod even more.The scene in the house, though, is pretty close to the original, although with an extra character played by Tim Robbins thrown in to complicate matters. He's a little off his rocker, but at first seems nice enough. But this scene with the alien probe and also several martians themselves who investigate the destroyed house where Cruise and his daughter are hiding I think worked out even better than in the original.Some of the other scenes are equally notable, especially the first one where the tripod first breaks out of the ground and starts laying waste to the city, catching the stunned populace completely by surprise. Then there's a scene later in the movie with the Hudson ferry which is also pretty cool but I don't want to say anything more in the way of a spoiler. :-)All in all, a great remake, but with one minor, and a major, quip. First the minor one: the first hour is the best, during which the aliens land and the tripods break out and start roaming the countryside, with devastating effects. The second hour isn't quite as strong, as too much time is spent on the Tim Robbins scene hiding in the house (although I like Tim as an actor), but this just completely arrests the action and I think it would have been better to keep the momentum going.The major quip relates to Cruise's two kids. They're unfortunately almost totally unsympathetic brats and one finds oneself regretting the martians didn't blast them in the first 20 minutes so you wouldn't have to put up with them for the rest of the movie, since Cruise spends most of the next two hours trying to save them from the martians, with them constantly getting in the way with their spoiled, bratty behavior.But despite those points, as I said, overall, a fine remake of the original even though I admit to a certain nostalgia for that one.By the way, a brief note on Wells. Today he is mostly remembered for several famous science fiction novels, but Wells published literally hundreds of papers, articles and books during his lifetime including politics, history, and science in addition to fiction, and in his day Wells was considered a universal genius. This was before Einstein became famous, whose name then become synonymous with genius, but before then people would say, ""As smart as H.G. Wells."" (Also, most people have never seen his full name written, which was Herbert George Wells).Wells was also basically the mentor of the famous American science fiction writer, Robert A. Heinlein. He was a great admirer of Wells (he once wrote Wells was the greatest science-fiction writer partly because he had read more and knew more than anyone else), and from whom Heinlein inherited the tradition of sociologically oriented science fiction.And one final comment on a perhaps minor point, but I appreciated it. The few people who have major speaking parts in Boston actually have good Bostonian accents. I live on the west coast these days, but my father was from Boston, and I commend Spielberg on paying attention to such perhaps trivial details.",5,Great remake but with a few

635344,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00005JNTI,"Maine Writer ""David""","[2, 5]","War of the Worlds is a so-so movie, thick with eye-candy (think of it as those really sour candies), and thin on just about everything else.Sure, there are moments when it works with a vengeance.  There is a scene when people turn on each other that is for moments terrifying; indeed, far more so than any of the aliens in the movie. The faces pressed to the glass, the zombie-like expressions, the live-at-all-costs insanity -- maybe Spielberg should try remaking Night of the Living Dead.Before turning to the meat of the thing, a few observations. The aliens themselves -- and you will, disappointingly, see them -- are a blatant rip-off of the aliens from Independence Day, except maybe a little less realistic. I guess you can't copyright aliens, which is too bad. And why are so many aliens (e.g., in Signs ... bad for its own set of reasons ... and here) naked?  Perhaps they have advanced beyond fashion.  If so, it is about the only thing advanced about them.  Their technology is creaky and retro, which might be interesting in a period piece I suppose. Here, it's just dumb. Then there's this whole thing about the ships having been buried on Earth millions/thousands of years ago.  Maybe that's why they're so dated looking. It's the equivalent, I suppose, of us burying cars on some planet, and then coming back millions of years later (in our intergalactic super-modern spaceships) and attacking in fleet of Desotos. (Come on. Ya think their technology stood still for millions of years?  Would any of them even know how to start the damn things?)And, of course, the various camera angles from the movie -- most noticeably at the beginning -- seem universally aimed at making Tom Cruise look taller than Mini-me. A couple of shots (perhaps intentionally) reveal, albeit briefly, that the only person shorter than him -- maybe -- is Dakota Fanning.But here's the bottom line.  The movie's story is extremely small, effectively portraying our species as truly unexceptional and barely sufferable, and entirely ineffectual.  And the point seems to be that individual humans might actually find a small measure of redemption in horrific circumstances.  Yes, peppered throughout the movie, are instances of kindness by a tiny subset of human beings.  Everyone else, though, seems to be willing to do just about anything to survive.  Probably true, but a small and rather obvious truth to carry $200 million of ""entertainment."" There is a character arc ... Ray Ferrier (who seems an awful lot like the real Tom Cruise we've seen in his bizarre Scientology outbursts) goes from a macho, semi-literate narcissist to a macho, semi-literate altruist (with absolutely no indication that it's a permanent change).  But what is the lesson?  What is the point?Apart from hokey narration at the beginning and the end, we learn little about the invaders (who carry their share of plot holes), we see that no one can do anything about them (except for a few of the tripods being destroyed rather fortuitously), and (true to Wells' story) we watch them brought down by divine/biological providence.  (Sounds like Signs, right?)This really is ""Steven Spielberg puts Signs, War of the Worlds, and Independence Day in a blender, and spits out a pastiche that doesn't even come close to good movie-making, let alone his best."" It has the visual and emotional appeal of watching a disaster unfold -- the same, sick fascination that kept some people glued to the screen on September 11, 2001.

Spielberg doesnt do that throughout the whole movie and that is why it fails. There is no emotional tie to the characters, no reason to love them, other than human pity. And Tom Cruises whole ""must save my daughter"" one-track approach was done much better and more believably by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens.This movie was too gory as weel. The plot holes and inconsistencies run wild and are too numerous to count. I can't suspend disbelief because Spielberg breaks too many rules and doesn't explain or justify anythign that takes place.

635352,A11A8GWG0IXBZH,B00005JNTI,"Mark Hills ""Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!""","[11, 14]","I tried to like this film, I really tried. Not because I happen to think that Steven Spielberg is the greatest director who ever stood behind a camera, but because I liked the subject matter. From Wells' original story, the Orson Wells adaptation, the George Pal film and Jeff Wayne's musical, I have enjoyed them all. It's just that most of Spielberg's films deal with small groups of people dealing with tightly focused events. Those events can often be large in scope or scale, like the Indiana Jones films, or a macrocosm, such as Jaws. Unfortunately, Spielberg made the same mistake M. Knight Shaymalan made with signs: He tried to tell the story of a planetary invasion from a macrocosmic view point, and that is very hard to do. More to the point, it can be done, but one wonders even if it should.Okay, Tom Cruise's public idiocy aside, I actually do like him in the roles he plays. Sadly, his on-screen persona as a divorced father Ray Ferrier, estranged from his wife as well of his kids, becomes the focus of the story and not the alien invasion. Repeated scenes of dad trying to bond with the kids gets tiresome very quickly and would have been more appropriately suited to a family drama instead of a science fiction actioneer. And don't get me started on Dakota Fanning; after her second ear-drum splitting scream, I wanted her tossed from the mini-van as it raced down the freeway.Also, I do not expect glaring technical mistakes in a Spielberg film, at least not ones you can drive a tripod through. The aliens (specifically not referred to as `Martians') blitz the planet with EMP (Electro-Magnetic Pulse) and every electronic device more complex than a battery no longer works. Okay, if they can do that, they win. All they have to do is land and march us into the disposal camps or eat us or whatever they plan to do with 6.5 billion human cattle. Aside from that, they buried their war machines all over the world (how long ago is never said) and they simply `transmit' their tripod pilots down into them then they rise up from the earth and begin their rampage. Okay, the problem here is, this takes place in New Jersey, how could 150 years of essentially unrestrained digging and construction have missed 80 meter tall spider-legged war machines?""It's the solenoids."" Says Tom to the mechanic fixing a minivan. Apparently he is the ONLY one in the world to make that automotive diagnosis regarding cars and is thusly the only one with an operation vehicle to create drama and tension later on at the ferry crossing. And let's not forgot the son's sudden desire to go watch the US military get its head handed to it at the top of the hill, then watching as burning hummers and other military hardware gets destroyed and yet somehow the kid makes it to Boston about 30 seconds after Ray and the screaming wonder do.Mostly the film is a jarring mix of typical Spielberg drama- the shooting at the ferry crossing, the insanity of Ogilvy and Ray's killing of him was both shocking and creepy and somber family moments. The people waiting at the train station only to watch stunned as it races by empty and on fire is also a good Spielberg-esque moment. The tripods themselves were beautifully done, terrifying and fascinating at the same time, especially the thunderous fog-horn long roars they made from time to time. But the film's demise is its narrow focus on trials of a family. I'm sorry, if alien death machines are rampaging through my city, I might be willing to put the fact that my father is kind of a jerk into the background for now. Apparently it isn't enough that Ferrier is working like a dog to keep his two children alive.In short, `War of the Worlds' as a film title is more about the Ferrier's world and the conflict within that set against the backdrop of the more interesting part of the story, that of alien invaders. Spielberg's unwillingness or lack of desire to confront the bigger picture cripples the film, because Wells' story as it has been adapted to the big screen before and in Jeff Wayne's musical treatment, is an action piece and not an excuse to spend two hours with the Ferrier family and their numerous dysfunctions.",2,"War of the What, now?",1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,4172,"['tried', 'like', 'film', 'really', 'tried', 'Not', 'happen', 'think', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'greatest', 'director', 'who', 'ever', 'stood', 'camera', 'liked', 'subject', 'matter', 'Wells', 'original', 'story', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'adaptation', 'George', 'Pal', 'film', 'Jeff', 'Wayne', 'musical', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'most', 'Spielberg', 'films', 'deal', 'small', 'groups', 'people', 'dealing', 'tightly', 'focused', 'events', 'events', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'large', 'scope', 'scale', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'films', 'macrocosm', 'such', 'Jaws', 'Unfortunately', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'same', 'mistake', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shaymalan', 'made', 'signs', 'tried', 'tell', 'story', 'planetary', 'invasion', 'macrocosmic', 'view', 'point', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'More', 'point', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'one', 'wonders', 'even', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'public', 'idiocy', 'aside', 'actually', 'do', 'roles', 'Sadly', 'on-screen', 'persona', 'divorced', 'father', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'estranged', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'kids', 'focus', 'story', 'not', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Repeated', 'scenes', 'dad', 'trying', 'bond', 'kids', 'tiresome', 'very', 'quickly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriately', 'suited', 'family', 'drama', 'instead', 'science', 'fiction', 'actioneer', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'second', 'ear-drum', 'splitting', 'scream', 'wanted', 'tossed', 'mini-van', 'raced', 'down', 'freeway.Also', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'glaring', 'technical', 'mistakes', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'least', 'not', 'ones', 'can', 'drive', 'tripod', 'aliens', 'specifically', 'not', 'referred', 'Martians', 'planet', 'EMP', 'Electro-Magnetic', 'Pulse', 'electronic', 'device', 'more', 'complex', 'battery', 'no', 'longer', 'Okay', 'can', 'do', 'win', 'have', 'do', 'land', 'march', 'disposal', 'camps', 'eat', 'plan', 'do', '6.5', 'billion', 'human', 'cattle', 'Aside', 'buried', 'war', 'machines', 'world', 'how', 'long', 'ago', 'never', 'said', 'simply', 'transmit', 'tripod', 'pilots', 'down', 'then', 'rise', 'up', 'earth', 'begin', 'rampage', 'Okay', 'problem', 'here', 'place', 'New', 'Jersey', 'how', 'could', '150', 'years', 'essentially', 'unrestrained', 'digging', 'construction', 'have', 'missed', '80', 'meter', 'tall', 'spider-legged', 'war', 'machines', 'solenoids', 'Tom', 'mechanic', 'fixing', 'minivan', 'Apparently', 'ONLY', 'one', 'world', 'make', 'automotive', 'diagnosis', 'regarding', 'cars', 'thusly', 'only', 'one', 'operation', 'vehicle', 'create', 'drama', 'tension', 'later', 'ferry', 'crossing', 'let', 'not', 'forgot', 'son', 'sudden', 'desire', 'go', 'watch', 'US', 'military', 'get', 'head', 'handed', 'top', 'hill', 'then', 'watching', 'burning', 'hummers', 'other', 'military', 'hardware', 'destroyed', 'yet', 'somehow', 'kid', 'Boston', '30', 'seconds', 'Ray', 'screaming', 'wonder', 'do.Mostly', 'film', 'jarring', 'mix', 'typical', 'Spielberg', 'drama-', 'shooting', 'ferry', 'crossing', 'insanity', 'Ogilvy', 'Ray', 'killing', 'was', 'shocking', 'creepy', 'somber', 'family', 'moments', 'people', 'waiting', 'train', 'station', 'only', 'watch', 'stunned', 'empty', 'fire', 'also', 'good', 'Spielberg-esque', 'moment', 'tripods', 'were', 'beautifully', 'done', 'terrifying', 'fascinating', 'same', 'time', 'especially', 'thunderous', 'fog-horn', 'long', 'roars', 'made', 'time', 'time', 'film', 'demise', 'narrow', 'focus', 'trials', 'family', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'alien', 'death', 'machines', 'are', 'rampaging', 'city', 'might', 'be', 'willing', 'put', 'fact', 'father', 'kind', 'jerk', 'background', 'now', 'Apparently', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Ferrier', 'working', 'dog', 'keep', 'two', 'children', 'short', 'War', 'Worlds', 'film', 'title', 'more', 'Ferrier', 'world', 'conflict', 'set', 'backdrop', 'more', 'interesting', 'part', 'story', 'alien', 'invaders', 'Spielberg', 'unwillingness', 'lack', 'desire', 'confront', 'bigger', 'picture', 'film', 'Wells', 'story', 'been', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'Jeff', 'Wayne', 'musical', 'treatment', 'action', 'piece', 'not', 'excuse', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'Ferrier', 'family', 'numerous', 'dysfunctions']",N/A

I would like to have seen Tom Cruise play the part of a man who discovered his courage in the face of impossible odds; however his character in the movie couldn't even manage his own children well.  I wanted to shoot Ray myself when he drove thru a desperate mob with the only functional vehicle probably for miles... DUHH!  Hey! Lets get on a boat in the middle of the river so the aliens can kill us all at once, together! DUHH!What would have happened if microbes and diseases HAD NOT killed the invaders?  Mankind would have been the new red sauce that the aliens were spraying all over the place. When the time comes to fight or be fodder what will YOU choose to do?  Does anyone out there really think that Earth is the only planet ANYWHERE that has life on it? Wake up people!I loved the aliens machines, very cool! If I were the aliens I would have used weapons that were a little more effective, like an energy wave that would vaporize EVERYTHING IN IT'S PATH to it most basic elements so that they can be reused. Much more efficient... Also, it looked like the aliens cockpits were filled with blood? Spooky....  I'll probably see the film again.  I  love the ""You figure it out"" danger/adventure movies because a person needs to start thinking when danger is all around.  When the people saw that alien craft come out of the ground they didn't know they were in danger until it started vaporizing people... If I had a daughter like the one in WOTW I would not have her sing nursery rhymes; If she wouldn't stop screaming I would tell her to shut up or put a rag in her mouth.  Don't get me wrong, I think that people should always be considerate.  The reason she was screaming like this is her family was not used to facing reality.  Who in America is? Her father certainly was not helping her get a grip on anything, either.  Also, what sense does it make to kill a man after he has invited you into HIS house?  So what if he won't shut up? You can just leave...  Again, I wanted to shoot Ray myself... no courage, dignity, smarts or strength at all...I also wanted to see more information about where the aliens came from, etc.  What was that red stuff growing all over the place?  How did the blood of humans fit into their plans?It is really disturbing to think that in the scenario mankind was helpless.  We have been so creative at killing each other you would think that one of our many techniques would have worked on the aliens....There is a lot missing from this film like:1. Why did'nt the government notify everyone that something strange was going on before the machines came out of the ground?2. The reason that military vehicles were functional in the film is that they are protected from EMP in real life.3.

More gore than I expected and that's ok.* The acting was superb all the way around.* The appearance of the Martian creatures was menacing enough for me.Problems:* Is it just me who finds this puzzling?  If the Martians came to Earth a million years ago to bury their war-making equipment, why didn't they just take over the earth and colonize it at that point?  Was it simply a matter of poor planning on the part of the Martians?  Are they lazy procrastinators by nature?  Or maybe it was a case of real estate speculation?  This is a major ""aside"" from the book, why did the screen play writer feel this little detail had to be added?  It was pointless to do so and made no sense what-so-ever.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  This crappy, shortsighted plot device pretty much spoiled the movie as far as I'm concerned.  In the book they come to earth, kick our collective butts and then catch the flu (or something like that) and die off.  Sounds fine to me, why change it?  Guess the screenplay writer figured he was a better writer than HG Wells...Not!* So, out of all the vehicles in New Jersey there is only one van that runs and Tom Cruise & family just happened to get lucky and get the van.

635358,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00005JNTI,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","Steven Spielberg has been known to paint a pretty picture when it comes to aliens. As far back as 1977 he was telling us that aliens would arrive in huge spaceships playing music to communicate and be as friendly as possible. Or they would be cute and cuddly and trying to just phone home. Now it turns out he was all wrong and is here to let you know.Based on the H.G. Wells novel, Spielberg gives us the dangerous aliens this time around. Tom Cruise portrays a divorced dockworker that gets the kids every so often and this week it's his turn. While his wife and her new husband go to visit her folks in Boston, he has the kids and from the get go you can tell that it's a strained relationship at best, due in large part to his irresponsible ways.After taking a nap he wakes to find that his son has taken his car and upon stepping outside discovers what seems to be a storm brewing. Watching closer it seems that this lightning storm is sending bolts over and over to the same spot. Cruise races to the spot where it hit and from that location a spaceship rises and begins vaporizing the people of New York.Gathering up his kids and taking the one vehicle still functioning (all power including batteries were blanked out when the lightning struck, Cruise helped get this van started), Cruise and family head for Boston. Along the way they encounter thousands of people fleeing the city and heading somewhere, anywhere. A news crew explains that the military has been unsuccessful in battling the aliens and all hope is lost. But they go on.The usual line of fighting between people trying to escape, all being killed off by aliens and by their own mad behavior as they go comes up while Cruise does his best to keep his family together. The choice to save his daughter or to hold his son back from trying to fight this invasion presents itself and the daughter wins. The chances of seeing his son again are nearly non existent. It's a heartbreaking moment that sticks with you.The story here is basic at best. Aliens invade earth. Aliens kick earth people's butts. All hope seems lost. If you don't know the end I won't spoil it for you. But this movie is not all about story, though it is there. It's about big budget special effects and this film delivers on all counts.The look of the spaceships is classic Wells with tripod aliens taking the lead. And the damage and destruction that they do is done so well that you believe all of the sights you are witness to. Explosions, houses and yards gone, planes crashed, people turned into nothing more than dust before your eyes, all are done so well that you never think of the words special effects.On the whole this is one movie that delivers the goods. It's a tale that captures the imagination and transposes it to the big screen, keeping the original tale intact. It lives up to the previous efforts made as well as the radio play. It is quite believable. And in that believability lays the one thing that makes this movie worth seeing.

635359,AIFNOZKR9WTYI,B00005JNTI,"mark twain ""25354""","[0, 0]","Here is how I would make The War of the Worlds:  The movie should not involve any alien invasion.  The aliens have been watching humans from their own planet - Mars, lets say - and have come to take a dim view of our doings.  They dispatch several robot probes which land on Earth.  Once humans have excitedly clustered around the probes, a large cylinder slowly emerges.  This cylinder turns out to be a heat ray device, which then vaporizes the crowd without ceremony, and rightly so.  This goes on until the entire human race has been selectively vaporized.  How would this work?  The heat ray is a kind of microwave device which is tuned to resonate specifically with human DNA.  This means that other organisms, with different DNA patterns, will be immune from the heat ray's specific oscillation.  Of course, certain non-human primates, with very similar DNA, might feel some effects.  Some chimps and apes might get a little cooked and their fur might smoke and whatnot but not so bad you'd notice.  On the whole they'd be all right.  And the other animals, they'd be just fine.  I can't express to you just how selective this vaporization program will be.Of course you might object, well if the aliens are so bent on destroying humanity, why don't they just infect us with a hantavirus or airborne ebola or something real nasty? Well the reason is that it is important to the Martians that we begin to see that we are being vaporized by superior beings, who are working us over good and solid by killer cylindrical robots.  They have done this sort of thing before.  In their vernacular, this operation is called ""doing a can drop.""  For example, one alien says to another (looking through a high-powered telescope) ""These people are no good.""  The other alien says, ""Oh I agree.  Lets drop some cans on them.""",5,Lets Get Disintegrated!,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,1818,"['Here', 'how', 'would', 'make', 'War', 'Worlds', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'involve', 'alien', 'invasion', 'aliens', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'humans', 'own', 'planet', 'Mars', 'lets', 'say', 'have', 'come', 'take', 'dim', 'view', 'doings', 'dispatch', 'several', 'robot', 'probes', 'land', 'Earth', 'Once', 'humans', 'have', 'excitedly', 'clustered', 'probes', 'large', 'cylinder', 'slowly', 'cylinder', 'out', 'be', 'heat', 'ray', 'device', 'then', 'crowd', 'ceremony', 'rightly', 'so', 'entire', 'human', 'race', 'been', 'selectively', 'vaporized', 'How', 'would', 'work', 'heat', 'ray', 'kind', 'microwave', 'device', 'tuned', 'resonate', 'specifically', 'human', 'DNA', 'other', 'organisms', 'different', 'DNA', 'patterns', 'will', 'be', 'immune', 'heat', 'ray', 'specific', 'oscillation', 'course', 'certain', 'non-human', 'primates', 'very', 'similar', 'DNA', 'might', 'feel', 'effects', 'chimps', 'apes', 'might', 'get', 'little', 'cooked', 'fur', 'might', 'smoke', 'whatnot', 'not', 'so', 'bad', ""'d"", 'notice', 'whole', ""'d"", 'be', 'right', 'other', 'animals', ""'d"", 'be', 'just', 'fine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'just', 'how', 'selective', 'vaporization', 'program', 'will', 'be.Of', 'course', 'might', 'object', 'well', 'aliens', 'are', 'so', 'bent', 'destroying', 'humanity', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'infect', 'hantavirus', 'airborne', 'ebola', 'something', 'real', 'nasty', 'Well', 'reason', 'important', 'Martians', 'begin', 'see', 'are', 'being', 'vaporized', 'superior', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'working', 'good', 'solid', 'killer', 'cylindrical', 'robots', 'have', 'done', 'sort', 'thing', 'vernacular', 'operation', 'called', 'doing', 'can', 'drop', 'example', 'one', 'alien', 'looking', 'high-powered', 'telescope', 'people', 'are', 'good', 'other', 'alien', 'Oh', 'agree', 'Lets', 'drop', 'cans']",N/A

Despite a primordial dislike for Tom Cruise, he is bearable as a bad father.  Towing his teenage son and preteen daughter along for the trip to Boston to see Mom and escape the aliens is a thrill ride that's not always pleasant.  The aliens truly are scary and the way they sneak around and blast, puncture, consume and annihilate humans is a nasty affair.  Sometimes the film eerily represents scenes from ""Schindler's List"" with the sooty sky and the tattered clothing scraps floating in the air.  There are some very frightening and ingenious romps along the way, like the runaway train on fire, the empty crashed airplane and the ferry full of people under attack.  Spielberg's effects are, of course, top notch and the dialogue fits very well without any false moves or insincere comments.  These people are going to die and they know it.  The basement scene with Tim Robbins is particularly harrowing with a surprise turn.  It's well made and acted and scary as hell, but don't expect any extras on this set.  Spielberg somehow refuses to let his DVD films contain those.

635361,AAY1YLTKK4JC7,B00005JNTI,"Martin Andrade ""Media Gurgitator""","[5, 8]","In a lot of ways I believe that today is the true golden age of science fiction films.  Not only are great new works like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" available, but Hollywood is revisiting old classics like this one.This film, ""War of the Worlds"" is a remake of the 1953 story of the same name, based on the H.G. Wells book of the same name.  Despite all that repetition, this film delivers what the previous incarnation couldn't, but the changes in story make a number of oddball plot holes that need to be ignored if one is to enjoy this film.I don't want to get too far into the plethora of problems with the updates version of story, as it might act as a spoiler to the film.  However, the big question that persists in my mind was ""when did they bury the tripods?""  In the film, the aliens are transported to their killing platforms, called ""tripods"" by lightning.  However, that just begs the question, when were they put there?  Why weren't they detected when the subways were built, how did they know they would need shields, and how did they know where the major cities would be?If you can get past this major point, you'll enjoy this film.  Spielberg puts forth a classic work of science fiction in a way the filmmakers of 1953 could only dream.  The death ray, the aliens, the carnage, all are incredible.  This is a great looking film, and the special effects are on par with any movie out there.One of the more notable points in the movie is when the main character, Ray Ferrier, is walking with a large group of refugees when they stop at a railroad crossing that is signaling that a train is coming.  Then the train crosses the screen, it's on fire, the whole car.  This glimpse of devastation (we get plenty) is rather poignant, and it ended up being rather humorous.  It was a very powerful scene; it showed the total desperation in the faces of those that were taking on the mental pressure of knowing that they were being exterminated.Another element that was enjoyable in this film was the shift from the floating craft of the 1953 film to the ""tripods"" that matched the described craft from the book.  The movie shifts between the retro look that matches the book, to the modern aspects of war fighting.  This it accomplishes quite well, like I said, it's a good looking film.As for the acting, there's nothing really all that spectacular.  Tom Cruise is what he always is.  Dakota Fanning plays the young daughter of Mr. Cruise's character, and does so well.  There are some noteworthy performances by bit players in the film, one of whom is Camillia Sanes, who plays a TV producer that encounters the Ferrier family and fortuitously describes all the ""need to know"" details that would have required a narrator.  Of course, the beginning and ending of the film were narrated by Morgan Freeman anyway.This movie is not perfect, it's not great, it's not grand, it's just an okay production of an aged sci-fi yarn.  The special effects are spectacular, the plot holes are many, the desperation feels real, and the aliens are stolen from ""Independence Day"".

However, state of the art special effects is not one of them.  These effects are truly stunning and carry the viewer's interest as far as special effects can do so. Now having said that, WAR OF THE WORLDS fails on any number of levels as an artistic and aesthtic creation.First, Tom Cruise gives a thoroughly mediocre performance as a divorced dad who spends the entire film doing little more than ducking the killing machines of the Martian tripods. (By the way, Spielberg never acknowledges Mars as the home planet of the invaders) For a character to garner viewer interest, that character must be sufficiently round to allow for personal growth.  In the earlier version (1954), Gene Barry did a much better job.Second, there was little sense of dramatic continuity, a fault I place on the scriptwriters.  Cruise was not given much to do except try to keep his obnoxious kids from screaming at the drop of a hat.  In the 1954 film, the audience was treated to a larger perspective: military leaders acted as a chorus, allowing the audience to see the invaders in more than one perspective.  Cruise's perspective of running and hiding wears thin pretty quickly.Third, the recents events of 9/11 acted as an unwelcome and annoying subtext that detracted from, rather than added to the potential richness of the theme of extermination. One might have legitimately confused the chaos of the fallen Twin Towers for the anarchy of the fleeing humans.  By the midpoint, Spielberg's overly allegorical style of backwards looking metaphor nudges the viewer from forward anticipation of the fate of humanity.Finally, the ending is not Spielberg's fault.  The deux ex machina resolution is taken straight from Wells who could not envision any way to defeat the Martians except by the hand of God.  However, in true Hollywood elitist anti-God stridency, Spielberg omits the role that the Creator played in the 1954 version, leaving the audience to wonder breathlessly how humanity could go from losers to winners in one quick scene.  For those who prefer the philosophy of Wells included on film, I recommend a second look at Gene Barry's version who knew how to involve the audience in the end of days.",3,War of the Worlds: Full of Sound & Fury,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,2293,"['are', 'number', 'problems', 'Spielberg', 'updated', 'version', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'However', 'state', 'art', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'one', 'effects', 'are', 'truly', 'stunning', 'carry', 'viewer', 'interest', 'as', 'far', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'Now', 'having', 'said', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'number', 'levels', 'artistic', 'aesthtic', 'creation.First', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'thoroughly', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'divorced', 'dad', 'who', 'entire', 'film', 'doing', 'little', 'more', 'ducking', 'killing', 'machines', 'Martian', 'tripods', 'way', 'Spielberg', 'never', 'Mars', 'home', 'planet', 'invaders', 'character', 'garner', 'viewer', 'interest', 'character', 'must', 'be', 'sufficiently', 'round', 'allow', 'personal', 'growth', 'earlier', 'version', '1954', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job.Second', 'was', 'little', 'sense', 'dramatic', 'continuity', 'fault', 'place', 'scriptwriters', 'Cruise', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'try', 'keep', 'obnoxious', 'kids', 'screaming', 'drop', 'hat', '1954', 'film', 'audience', 'was', 'treated', 'larger', 'perspective', 'military', 'leaders', 'acted', 'chorus', 'allowing', 'audience', 'see', 'invaders', 'more', 'one', 'perspective', 'Cruise', 'perspective', 'running', 'hiding', 'wears', 'thin', 'pretty', 'quickly.Third', 'recents', 'events', '9/11', 'acted', 'unwelcome', 'annoying', 'subtext', 'detracted', 'rather', 'added', 'potential', 'richness', 'theme', 'extermination', 'One', 'might', 'have', 'legitimately', 'confused', 'chaos', 'fallen', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'anarchy', 'fleeing', 'humans', 'midpoint', 'Spielberg', 'overly', 'allegorical', 'style', 'backwards', 'looking', 'metaphor', 'viewer', 'forward', 'anticipation', 'fate', 'humanity.Finally', 'ending', 'not', 'Spielberg', 'fault', 'deux', 'ex', 'machina', 'resolution', 'taken', 'straight', 'Wells', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'envision', 'way', 'defeat', 'Martians', 'hand', 'God', 'However', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'elitist', 'anti-God', 'stridency', 'Spielberg', 'role', 'Creator', 'played', '1954', 'version', 'leaving', 'audience', 'wonder', 'breathlessly', 'how', 'humanity', 'could', 'go', 'losers', 'winners', 'one', 'quick', 'scene', 'who', 'prefer', 'philosophy', 'Wells', 'included', 'film', 'recommend', 'second', 'look', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'version', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'involve', 'audience', 'end', 'days']",N/A
635363,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B00005JNTI,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[29, 40]","* Contains spoilers *I didn't see this one in the cinema because of the very mixed reviews. But I remained curious, so eventually saw it on DVD. Some aspects of this movie are rather refreshing, I found. For once, the story of an invasion by an evil, alien force is not told from the perspective of scientists, generals and presidents who have to solve the problem, but from the point of view of ordinary people overwhelmed by something huge and incomprehensible. Yet this very incomprehensibility makes for an unsatisfying movie experience. Whereas many films suffer from the problem that they want to explain everything, this one hardly explains anything at all. The only explanations we get are given through the archaic and out of place device of an anonymous voice over, citing some sentences from Wells's novel. Otherwise, you might say that this film is actually plotless. Terrible machines pop up out of nowhere and start killing and devastating; one and a half hours later they just collapse and that's it. Who these aliens are, what exactly motivates them, where they came from - we're not told any of this. All we get are a few hints, and these cause more confuison rather than less. We are are led to believe that the tripods were planted underground before mankind even began; ""They planned all of this millions of years ago"". The notion is of course ludicrous: it`s like 21st century mankind going to war in a horse-and-chariot. Moreover, why did the aliens not invade right away then? They could have spared themselves the trouble of having to deal with billions of obnoxious humans. For an intelligence supposedly so far developed, the method chosen for the extermination of eartlings also seems rather cumbersome and labour-intensive. And what's with the blood-drinking? If these creatures need human blood, where did they get it before? That such a superior intelligence, which has been planning its invasion for so long, would overlook the obvious danger of alien microbes is of course silly, and is the crucial weakness in the storyline, which it shares with Wells's original. Finally (and then I'll stop, though there is much more) we are told the aliens watched our planet with envy - yet as soon as they invade it they set about turning it into a horrible wasteland. Why?So what's the good news? Mainly, that the special effects are generally first rate. Don't expect any great originality - the aliens are your average mushroom-headed, mirror-eyed, spidery-bodied Quasimodo's - but it's all done with gusto, and we get some signature Steven Spielberg weird stormy skies to boot. The film does contain a few images that are truly memorable, and the huge size of the tripods is believably rendered - often by not showing them directly, but, for instance, reflected in the wind-screen of a car. Unfortunately, once Earth's landscape is transformed by the aliens the viewer finds that despite the whole CGI magic box, no convincing alternative has yet been found for the old fashioned matte painting and blue screen. Also, some of the sets were strangely reminiscent of Tim Burton's recent Charly and the Chocolate Factory.There's not much to say about the acting. Tom Cruise does steer clear of his pretty boy imago and is fairly convincing as the somewhat dysfunctional father who suddenly actually has to take care of his brood. The spontaneous heroism of his unruly son, however, is almost as hard to understand as his miraculous reappearance in the final scene, after we saw him walking of into a blazing fire storm to go and fight the aliens. The obligatory, wide-eyed little girl (blonde, of course) seems rather more mature than her father and is rather more scary than the aliens; her insistent screaming is an absolute pest.An intelligent action thriller? No, not quite. As far as I know there've been exactly two truly intelligent films about contact with aliens: Close Encouters, and Contact. Time spent with those is time much better spent than with this unsuccesful attempt.",2,Pointless,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,4008,"['*', 'spoilers', '*I', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'cinema', 'very', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'remained', 'curious', 'so', 'eventually', 'saw', 'DVD', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'found', 'once', 'story', 'invasion', 'evil', 'alien', 'force', 'not', 'told', 'perspective', 'scientists', 'generals', 'presidents', 'who', 'have', 'solve', 'problem', 'point', 'view', 'ordinary', 'people', 'overwhelmed', 'something', 'huge', 'incomprehensible', 'very', 'incomprehensibility', 'unsatisfying', 'movie', 'experience', 'Whereas', 'many', 'films', 'suffer', 'problem', 'want', 'explain', 'everything', 'one', 'hardly', 'anything', 'only', 'explanations', 'get', 'are', 'given', 'archaic', 'place', 'device', 'anonymous', 'voice', 'citing', 'sentences', 'Wells', 'novel', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'say', 'film', 'actually', 'plotless', 'Terrible', 'machines', 'pop', 'up', 'nowhere', 'start', 'killing', 'devastating', 'one', 'half', 'hours', 'later', 'just', 'collapse', 'Who', 'aliens', 'are', 'what', 'exactly', 'where', 'came', ""'re"", 'not', 'told', 'get', 'are', 'few', 'hints', 'cause', 'more', 'confuison', 'rather', 'less', 'are', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'tripods', 'were', 'planted', 'underground', 'mankind', 'even', 'began', 'planned', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'notion', 'course', 'ludicrous', 's', '21st', 'century', 'mankind', 'going', 'war', 'horse-and-chariot', 'Moreover', 'why', 'did', 'aliens', 'not', 'invade', 'right', 'away', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'spared', 'trouble', 'having', 'deal', 'billions', 'obnoxious', 'humans', 'intelligence', 'supposedly', 'so', 'far', 'developed', 'method', 'chosen', 'extermination', 'eartlings', 'also', 'rather', 'cumbersome', 'labour-intensive', 'what', 'blood-drinking', 'creatures', 'need', 'human', 'blood', 'where', 'did', 'get', 'superior', 'intelligence', 'been', 'planning', 'invasion', 'so', 'long', 'would', 'overlook', 'obvious', 'danger', 'alien', 'microbes', 'course', 'silly', 'crucial', 'weakness', 'storyline', 'shares', 'Wells', 'original', 'Finally', 'then', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'told', 'aliens', 'watched', 'planet', 'envy', 'yet', 'as', 'soon', 'invade', 'set', 'turning', 'horrible', 'wasteland', 'Why', 'what', 'good', 'news', 'Mainly', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'generally', 'first', 'rate', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'originality', 'aliens', 'are', 'average', 'mushroom-headed', 'mirror-eyed', 'spidery-bodied', 'Quasimodo', 'done', 'gusto', 'get', 'signature', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'weird', 'stormy', 'skies', 'boot', 'film', 'contain', 'few', 'images', 'are', 'truly', 'memorable', 'huge', 'size', 'tripods', 'believably', 'rendered', 'often', 'not', 'showing', 'directly', 'instance', 'reflected', 'wind-screen', 'car', 'Unfortunately', 'once', 'Earth', 'landscape', 'transformed', 'aliens', 'viewer', 'whole', 'CGI', 'magic', 'box', 'convincing', 'alternative', 'yet', 'been', 'found', 'old', 'fashioned', 'matte', 'painting', 'blue', 'screen', 'Also', 'sets', 'were', 'strangely', 'reminiscent', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'recent', 'Charly', 'Chocolate', 'Factory.There', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'acting', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'steer', 'clear', 'pretty', 'boy', 'imago', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'somewhat', 'dysfunctional', 'father', 'who', 'suddenly', 'actually', 'take', 'care', 'brood', 'spontaneous', 'heroism', 'unruly', 'son', 'however', 'almost', 'as', 'hard', 'understand', 'miraculous', 'reappearance', 'final', 'scene', 'saw', 'walking', 'blazing', 'fire', 'storm', 'go', 'fight', 'aliens', 'obligatory', 'wide-eyed', 'little', 'girl', 'blonde', 'course', 'rather', 'more', 'mature', 'father', 'rather', 'more', 'scary', 'aliens', 'insistent', 'screaming', 'absolute', 'pest.An', 'intelligent', 'action', 'thriller', 'No', 'not', 'quite', 'As', 'far', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exactly', 'two', 'truly', 'intelligent', 'films', 'contact', 'aliens', 'Close', 'Encouters', 'Contact', 'Time', 'spent', 'time', 'much', 'better', 'spent', 'unsuccesful', 'attempt']",N/A

It is my belief that it's Ray Ferrier's fault. He is a main character with who is very difficult, for the viewer, to identify with.Ray Ferrier is quite obtuse, insensible to his ex-wife, unable to empathize with his teenaged son, he is not even able to prepare a decent meal and leaves little Rachel to take care.When things start to go really wrong he is simply dumb!The story starts in our everyday world, soon disrupted by mighty storms and followed by murderous alien invasion.Ferrier and his child are on the run and that's all until the end!Dakota Fanning is just paramount. I've seen her acting in ""Man on Fire"" (2004) and I was delighted. Well in this movie she's better! What first come to my mind to define her performance is: ""she acts naturally"" (in an unnatural background). She is really anguished or scared or whatever emotion she need to transmit.Tom Cruise is solid in his performance.

Then I got told it was Canberra, and then Melbourne. I had to look up an atlas, but it's definitely Canberra. There. You don't get nothing for free these days, so remember that the next time you're doing a pub quiz.Back to the review.I normally hate Tom Cruise & Dakota Fanning with a passion, and apparently, many people agree with me, as he was just named most irritating star. And she's just a precocious little brat. But I actually liked both stars in this - OK, Dakota more than Tom, he just plain irritates me. I actually felt sorry for her during this film, and considering she spends most of her time crying or screaming, I felt for her.During the filming of the underwater scenes (where the ferry capsizes) Steven Spielberg played a prank on Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning by playing the dramatic music from Jaws through the massive underwater speakers on the sound stage. This was also Dakota Fanning's first ever stunt. And would anyone else have killed Steven Spielberg at this point? I certainly would have done.The thing that gets on my nerves about the son, is he's a stereotypical teenage boy, who plays loud music, takes his dad's car without permission, and has a massive chip on his shoulder. But the way he acts towards his little sister, kinda makes up for that. There's also too much focus to begin with on the ""I'm-a-bad-father"" rubbish. Uh huh, yeah, get over it.Tim Robbins' line, ""It's not a war any more than it's a war between men and maggots,"" is a slightly modified quote from the original novel, substituting ""maggots"" for ""ants"". The line was also used in the infamous 1939 Orson Welles radio broadcast. In addition, the news reporter's line, ""Once they begin to move, no more news comes out of that area,"" is taken directly from the 1953 film. Also taken from the original film were the scenes with the probe examining the basement followed by the inquisitive aliens. Tom chops the head off the probe with an ax just as Gene Barry did in the original. Also the shot of the dying alien's arm coming down the ramp is a reference to a similar shot in the original film.Was anyone else reminded of the eco skeletons from Terminator with the aliens in this film? And how scary were they?! Brrrrrr. There's a lot of imagery used from real life, 9/11, filmed with the camera set at a person's eye-sight. This manner of filming was influenced by the amateur footage of the terrorist attacks on New York City of 11 September 2001. I found it extremely freaky, after seeing survivors from 9/11 coming out covered in white dust, then seeing Tom in the same situation. I got shivers up my spine. There's also scary scenes of people being blasted apart by the rays from the aliens - split second scenes of their skeleton will give anyone the creeps.I wasn't too sure about the ending. It seems rushed, and it's over before you can grasp what actually happened. I caught something about viruses, but that's about it. And what was with the whole scene in the basement, with who I've been told is Tim Robbins? That scene didn't make sense. I don't think Tom's character had the guts to kill someone.I did enjoy this film, and it's a welcome addition to my DVD collection, and I think the extras might be quite interesting, but you must watch this with an open mind - it takes a lot for you to believe that Tom's character is an ""Average Joe"".",4,What's the capital of Australia?,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,3428,"['got', 'three', 'answers', 'thinking', 'was', 'definitely', 'Sydney', 'Then', 'got', 'told', 'was', 'Canberra', 'then', 'Melbourne', 'had', 'look', 'up', 'atlas', 'definitely', 'Canberra', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'nothing', 'free', 'days', 'remember', 'next', 'time', ""'re"", 'doing', 'pub', 'quiz.Back', 'review.I', 'normally', 'hate', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'passion', 'apparently', 'many', 'people', 'agree', 'was', 'just', 'named', 'most', 'irritating', 'star', 'just', 'precocious', 'little', 'brat', 'actually', 'liked', 'stars', 'OK', 'Dakota', 'more', 'Tom', 'just', 'plain', 'irritates', 'actually', 'felt', 'sorry', 'film', 'considering', 'most', 'time', 'crying', 'screaming', 'felt', 'her.During', 'filming', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'where', 'ferry', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'played', 'prank', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'playing', 'dramatic', 'music', 'Jaws', 'massive', 'underwater', 'speakers', 'sound', 'stage', 'was', 'also', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'first', 'ever', 'stunt', 'would', 'anyone', 'else', 'have', 'killed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'point', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'done.The', 'thing', 'nerves', 'son', 'stereotypical', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'loud', 'music', 'dad', 'car', 'permission', 'massive', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'way', 'little', 'sister', 'kinda', 'up', 'also', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'begin', ""I'm-a-bad-father"", 'rubbish', 'Uh', 'huh', 'yeah', 'get', 'it.Tim', 'Robbins', 'line', 'not', 'war', 'more', 'war', 'men', 'maggots', 'slightly', 'modified', 'quote', 'original', 'novel', 'substituting', 'maggots', 'ants', 'line', 'was', 'also', 'used', 'infamous', '1939', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'addition', 'news', 'reporter', 'line', 'begin', 'move', 'more', 'news', 'area', 'taken', 'directly', '1953', 'film', 'Also', 'taken', 'original', 'film', 'were', 'scenes', 'probe', 'examining', 'basement', 'followed', 'inquisitive', 'aliens', 'Tom', 'head', 'probe', 'ax', 'just', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'did', 'original', 'Also', 'shot', 'dying', 'alien', 'arm', 'coming', 'down', 'ramp', 'reference', 'similar', 'shot', 'original', 'film.Was', 'anyone', 'else', 'reminded', 'eco', 'skeletons', 'Terminator', 'aliens', 'film', 'how', 'scary', 'were', 'Brrrrrr', 'lot', 'imagery', 'used', 'real', 'life', '9/11', 'filmed', 'camera', 'set', 'person', 'eye-sight', 'manner', 'filming', 'was', 'influenced', 'amateur', 'footage', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'New', 'York', 'City', '11', 'September', '2001', 'found', 'extremely', 'freaky', 'seeing', 'survivors', '9/11', 'coming', 'out', 'covered', 'white', 'dust', 'then', 'seeing', 'Tom', 'same', 'situation', 'got', 'shivers', 'up', 'spine', 'also', 'scary', 'scenes', 'people', 'being', 'blasted', 'apart', 'rays', 'aliens', 'split', 'second', 'scenes', 'skeleton', 'will', 'give', 'anyone', 'creeps.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'ending', 'rushed', 'over', 'can', 'grasp', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'caught', 'something', 'viruses', 'what', 'was', 'whole', 'scene', 'basement', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Tom', 'character', 'had', 'guts', 'kill', 'someone.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'welcome', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'think', 'extras', 'might', 'be', 'quite', 'interesting', 'must', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'lot', 'believe', 'Tom', 'character', 'Average', 'Joe']",N/A
635374,A2OIG88PG8K4M3,B00005JNTI,"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado""","[12, 16]","Steven Spielberg is a master of evoking moods. In ""Jaws"" he inspired in us the dread of a thing that we didn't even see till near the end of the film; in ""Empire of the Sun"" (my personal Spielberg favorite), he showed us the exhilaration and desperation of a child being forced to grow up but not always disliking it; in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" he aroused a wonderment and thrill about life itself. ""War of the Worlds"" evokes a mood too, but here it is one of total dread and despair. Gone are the pleasant, curious aliens of ""Close Encounters"" or ""E.T.,"" just dropping in to say hello; these aliens are mean, terroristic creatures whose only plans are destroying all life on our planet. Spielberg is still highly effective at inspiring in us whatever emotion he wishes to create, but here that is really all that he accomplishes.For one thing, I believe casting Tom Cruise was a mistake. He is not incompetent, certainly, but one is never really able to see him and not think ""he is Tom Cruise the international mega-star and he will triumph because he gets twenty million a picture and cannot die."" Spielberg has used well-known actors to his advantage before, such as Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones films and Jude Law in ""A.I.,"" but here I found Cruise distracting rather than believable. He has more than a few good moments, especially when sharing the screen with Dakota Fanning, but mostly I couldn't shake the fact that it was just Tom Cruise up there. Unlike the amazing Johnny Depp, who can sink so far into his roles that he becomes invisible as a performer, Tom Cruise is unable to shake off his movie-starness, and that damaged the film severely. His presence constantly reminded me that he was Tom Cruise the Movie Star, acting, and that nothing truly terrible could happen to him precisely because he was Tom Cruise the Movie Star.Dakota Fanning as Rachel is sorely underused; she is young but an actress of remarkable nuance and talent, and here is reduced principally to screaming uncontrollably for most of her screen time. Her eyes are still impressively communicative: she can convey wide-eyed awe and wide-eyed horror in the same expression. The addition of the daughter was a useful enhancement to Wells' story, as it gave the film a father-daughter dynamic that was compelling, but the inclusion of a son was unnecessary; Robbie is no more than the average movie teen, sullen and rebellious, and is so extraneous to the real action that he is sent away halfway through and not seen again till the very end of the movie. Miranda Otto too is sadly neglected; she has a compelling blend of delicacy and strength to her that is intriguing on camera, but her character is not really allowed to develop at all before she too is shuffled away till the end of the film. Tim Robbins is suitably creepy as the old and insane codger Harlan Ogilvy, who offers Ray and his daughter Rachel shelter. One of the film's most chilling moments comes when Harlan jeopardizes Rachel's safety, and Ray must deal with him in what one suspects (but never shown) is a very unpleasant manner. An ominously closed cellar door and a mysteriously appearing hatchet are involved to great effect, though we see nothing.I was not convinced by the story, however, even though it follows fairly closely to Wells' novel; there are far too many questions raised which my brain could not suspend disbelief for. Why, for instance, would these aliens be so keen to annihilate that which they plan to harvest and utilize? And what exactly do they harvest humans for, anyway? If they need us so badly, how have they survived all these long years without us? And why, if they've been planning on all this for ""millions of years,"" would they have failed to analyze a little detail like the bacterial and viral components of our biosphere? And, for that matter, why with all the underground tunnels and subways and water mains dug into our modern cities were these huge machines never discovered?All in all, though, even with its weaknessess of plot I was not truly disappointed until the last ten minutes or so of the film. The mood of the movie, as I said before, is evoked very, very well, as one would expect from a master like Spielberg, who knows how to concoct an emotion-driven blockbuster like nobody else. We are grasped almost immediately by dread, followed closely by the sense of ineluctable devastation and doom. It is a disaster picture clearly informed by 9/11 and this age of terrorism awareness; the images of burning airplane wreckage, flaming trains rushing full-speed through stations, and people running down the street coated in human ash are haunting. However, even at 116 minutes the film is overlong. Particularly the middle section of the film, with the aliens' seemingly unstoppable march of destruction, becomes repetitive; there are only so many times we can see things being blown up and those bizarre tripod things ransacking Earth and zapping humans before it becomes just another something we've seen before. Another really depressing something.The film's conclusion is what ultimately lost my respect for the movie. I found it utterly unsatisfying: having spent nearly the last two hours creating a very acute sense of inescapable annihilation, Spielberg suddenly ends it all in a great hurry with a fantastically implausible and rushed conclusion, seemingly concocted just because the film was two hours and needed to end. This isn't really the case; Wells has the same ending, but in the film it seems plucked from thin air and dismayingly out of place with what comes before. Morgan Freeman's portentous voice-over, seemingly inspired by National Geographic specials on PBS, doesn't help any. In the end, the elements simply failed to coalesce into a satisfying whole, and I left the theatre feeling nothing in particular at all about the movie, which is something I have never experienced with a Spielberg movie before. It is not as bad as many pictures released this summer - ""Herbie: Fully Loaded"" and ""Fantastic Four"" spring to mind - and you could do much worse at the multiplex; it's just that with Spielberg, you expect to be able to do much better.",2,Spectacularly underwhelming,1121472000,"07 16, 2005",2005,6189,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'master', 'evoking', 'moods', 'Jaws', 'inspired', 'dread', 'thing',

635375,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00005JNTI,Melissa Niksic,"[3, 5]","I barely remember any of the details of the original ""War of the Worlds"" movie, so I can't really compare the Tom Cruise/Steven Spielberg version to its predecessor. I had no desire to see this film when it debuted in theatres, partially because Cruise has really freaked me out with his crazy antics these past few years and also because the idea of sitting through yet another alien movie just didn't appeal to me. However, I decided to give the film a chance when it ran on HBO, and I was pleasantly surprised. ""War of the Worlds"" isn't half bad...in fact, it's actually GOOD.The plot of the movie is pretty straightforward: Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a divorced father of two who doesn't have the greatest relationship with his children (Justin Chatwan and Dakota Fanning). Ray's ex-wife (Miranda Otto) leaves the kids with her former husband before taking a trip out of town. Soon after her departure, a series of bizarre lighting storms hits the area hard. Then the ground opens up and huge robotic-like creatures with tentacles emerge from the ground and start attacking people! (It sounds kind of ridiculous, but the special effects are outstanding.) More aliens show up and Ray and his children attempt to flee, but they have to face many different obstacles along the way, including angry mobs of people, a crazy man (Tim Robbins) who is determined to fight the aliens until the end, and of course, the aliens themselves.This movie does have its faults. It's amazing to me that Ray and his kids were able to hold onto their stolen van for so long: they emerged from a burning house to find that the aliens had shot down airplanes that crash-landed into everything in the neighborhood, but miraculously, the van remained intact. Some little things like that were just a bit too farfetched. I also think the whole Morgan Freeman narration at the beginning and end of the film was poorly done. The film doesn't do a good job of explaining what exactly happened to the aliens at the end: I think there could have been ten minutes of additional footage SHOWING what happened instead of just having the narrator sum it up in a couple of sentences.

635377,AMG2LF8MLUDN1,B00005JNTI,M. Fields,"[0, 0]","It's all about the aliens in this film.  I don't know that the casting of Tom Cruise was necessary considering his current price for movie work these days.  I can think of some less famous actors that would have done a fine job.  Not that Cruise was bad in the part.  Having said that though, the cgi rocks big time.  The alien ships look great and the sound effects were just as good.  In fact, the sounds that the ships make while they shooting things vibrates in your chest and makes you feel like you're going to be the next one to get it.  That's the fun of seeing it in a movie theater.  The look of the movie on the whole takes on a depressing gray cast which adds to the despair of it all.  It may be awful to say but it sure was fun to see the aliens zap everything in their paths.  Spielberg resisted the urge (for the most part) to put his usual happy spin on the ball and took us from one terrifying moment to the next.  Cruise does not so much play the hero here (since he can't do anything to stop the aliens anyway) but instead learns how to be a better father during the ordeal.  But you know what?  No one really cares.  We want to see what the aliens are going to do.  The movie ends as the original does (if you can remember).  The aliens die because they aren't used to all the little micro-organisms and germs that we have on this planet.  Things that humans are used to.  Knowing the ending doesn't make the film any less suspensful.  Tim Robbins played a strange small part and I'm not sure that it added anything to the movie except that he's a crazy guy hiding from the aliens in a basement and gives  two people a place to hide for a short while.  Cruise has to whack the guy because he's just too nuts.  Whatever.

Wells novel certainly has some awesome special effects and captures the terror of the novel and its 1953 version as well.  If there's a problem with this version, it seems to lie in the miscasting of Tom Cruise as the deadbeat father who suddenly becomes mature and responsible.  Cruise, a moderately convincing actor, doesn't seem quite credible in this role, and it could be his persona has become so engrained in our minds that it's difficult to see him in this fatherly role.  The wonderfully talented Dakota Fanning, however, does a beautiful job in conveying the horror she is forced to witness as aliens annihilate most of the planet.  While thankfully not a gorefest, the movie has some pretty terrifying moments and just imagining what fate earthlings are meeting is frightening in its own right.

635387,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JNTI,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 4]","My dad and uncle have been waiting for this film with rabid anticipation since they heard about it at a recent science fiction convention.  I reserved judgment, alternately thrilled that Steven Spielberg was helming the project and concerned that Tom Cruise was the lead actor.I needn't have worried.I was introduced to War of the Worlds through the 1953 version, then the radio play, and then finally the book.  Each incarnation differs from its predecessor in important ways.  But like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the incarnations have become so representative of their times that they all provide important contributions to the overall story, sometimes even overshadowing the original.  Whether the Marians invade the Thames or Grover Mills, New Jersey, the story of foreign invaders is always relevant.I'll admit it...I wasn't ready for this version of War of the Worlds.To clarify, I live north of New York City.  I was not at Ground Zero of September 11, but I did some volunteer work to help out the victims.  I saw a huge smoke cloud over the site, weeks after the attack.  I remember the conversation amongst my fellow volunteers: nobody believed it was possible to have such a horrible reminder still floating in the air after such a terrible event. But it was true.  Something that awful does not simply disappear after the rubble stops falling.In War of the Worlds, Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a deadbeat dad with two kids he obviously hasn't seen in awhile.  His wife (Miranda Otto of Eowyn fame) drops off preteen Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and teen Robbie (Justin Chatwin), only to discover that Ray has no food or even separate rooms for the kids. Then the lightning storms start, without any thunder at all, and Ray's amusement at the whole event slowly transforms to terror.An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) fries all electronics, leaving Ray's home without electricity or communication.  So Ray visits the site of one of the lightning strikes, unwittingly placing himself at ground zero of the invasion.  The lightning bolts are actually alien pilots touching down from space, landing in war machines buried thousands of years ago. Then the invasion begins.The tripods, unlike the 50s version, are decidedly machines . They whirr and click and, most disturbingly of all, BELLOW in a sound that can only be psychological warfare.  Striding on three thin legs tipped with three pod-shaped toes, the machines fire disintegration rays that destroy all living flesh but not clothing.  There is more than one scene of clothing floating through the air, shades of the debris still floating in that cloud over the Twin Towers.The threat in the movie isn't from the aliens alone.  Ray knows from the outset that owning a functioning car after an EMP is a valuable find and he intends to protect it and his family with a revolver.  But as Spielberg deftly portrays, the power of the gun is only in the hands of whoever holds it at the moment.  And who holds a gun can change very quickly.In a lot of ways, this movie is the realization of what M. Night Shyamalan was trying to do with Signs.  The film rockets from paranoia about the alien's motives to terror at their awesome power to creepy claustrophobia as alien probes scope out the ruins.  Signs felt choppy and disjointed.  War of the Worlds has none of those problems, and it relentlessly ups the destruction and the inhumanity of it all (of the aliens and of humans with each other) right up to the end.Forget Cruise's silly ranting on Oprah.  If you're of a more cynical nature, his recent public displays might provide even better insight into his character. In this movie, Cruise provides a fine performance as a self-centered jerk that doesn't know much about his kids.  It's only when he realizes he might lose them that Ray rises to the occasion, and there is nothing he won't do to protect his flesh and blood.Dakota Fanning is at her finest here, convincingly playing an articulate little girl who desperately needs her father when he's got so many other things to worry about.  The other characters are not as significant. Tim Robbins plays a nutty Ogivly (a character from the original book) and Ray's older son slowly transforms from a petulant brat to a man who wants to go to war...unfortunately, the actor has difficulty pulling that off.Spielberg's version of War of the Worlds is not a science fiction parable, like the 1950s version.  It's not a polemic on the folly of man, like the original book.  Any marvel at how the alien technology works is lost in their relentless, seemingly purposeless, destruction of humanity. It's much closer to the radio play in that it's a survival horror.That horror is best summed up in a question, never broached in the 50s version: Why are the tripods COLLECTING people? Spielberg unflinchingly tells us.H.G. Wells' himself provided the best reaction to the answer: ""The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.""Humans should definitely see this movie, if only as a reminder of our own vulnerability, both physically and mentally.

Smith,"[1, 1]","I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, nor of remakes generally, and as a lifelong SF fan, I didn't expect to find anything new or interesting in the umpteenth ""updating"" of the classic H. G. Wells invasion story, even though it's Spielberg's take. But I was wrong. First, the invaders (carefully *not* called ""Martians"" here, since we now know way too much about Mars to believe that) are tripedal and attack Earth with walking war machines, as in the original book -- and unlike the 1953 film, which featured sort-of flying saucers. Second, Cruise under-acts (I didn't think he was capable of that) and lets the story pretty much focus on the invasion itself. There are many excellent, gripping (not to say nerve-wracking) bits of cinematic business, especially the corpses floating in the river, and the downed 707 in the front yard, and the capsized ferry (safety gained and immediately lost), and the crows (symbol of Death) following the war machines, and the Minute Man statue. The camera is almost always at eye-level (not panoramic), which tightens the effect on the viewer. The special effects actually contribute to the story for a change, especially the lightning at the beginning. And Spielberg, naturally, throws in numerous references to his own earlier films, as well as to the 1953 version and to the book. Tim Robbins, as the would-be resister in the cellar (a composite of several characters from Wells's book), does a very good job (as always). But Dakota Fanning, who is an amazingly mature actress for eleven years old, unequivocally steals the show. (""I'm allergic to peanut butter."" ""Oh, yeah, since when?""

I felt sick watching every single seen altered in ways that are not needed to tell the story, the tine of the movie is this retro bright ugly looking thing and every scene set at night has all this god awful CGI smoke or fog that was just overkill by the time the thing finished.Hollyweed need to stop making remakes and sequels by known directors and start hunting for new movie-makers with fresh ideas because Spielberg has really lost on this un-needed remake that steals a page out of George Lucas' book and goes way over board with un-needed CGI that took all my attention away from what was supposed to be happening in the film and not distracting me from suspending belief into the film.And I may get hounded for this but I'm also sick of Dakota Fanning. Why cant they cast a kid who acts like a kid? not a kid who acts like a 30 year old. It might be easier for directors to work with her, and it may well be a delight to act with her, but for god sakes, who has a kid who talks like her? Would you believe she was your own daughter?

635394,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JNTI,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 4]","The celebrated author H.G. Wells was one of humanity's most gifted visionaries, long before his time. Not only was he successful in launching a entirely new genre in science fiction writing with the development of the alien invasion premise, he also brought to the forefront the frightening prospect of war and its impact on society as a whole. Though a majority of his works can and should be treated as nothing more then pure imaginative storytelling, Wells included in a few of his writings social commentaries about modern society that are worth mentioning. The Time Machine, for example, centered on the whimsical concept of traveling through time but also highlighted the significance of education and reading in maintaining the basic cultural structure of civilization. In turn, War of the Worlds was a commentary on two primary fronts - it promoted the ideal of humanity uniting together against a common enemy and the belief that disease could play a pivotal role in war, both of which proved themselves to be preludes to the emergence of World War I in Europe. Now as free world faces the onslaught of terrorism, a frightening reality which continues to loom large in light of the recent terrorist attacks in London, the message of mankind uniting against a common adversary, a common evil, is an ideal that is more warranted now then ever before.The story for War of the Worlds, albeit an exhilarating and emotionally draining experience to witness, particularly if you happen to have weak constitution for the sight of human beings being incinerated alive, does not pack quite the punch it would have several years ago. Steven Spielberg is at his directing best with War of the Worlds, doubtlessly his most graphic pictorial since his 1998 epic war drama Saving Private Ryan, and Cruise brings honest emotional integrity to the family story arch of the film. Adversely, with audiences having already experienced Independence Day and M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, both of whose stories were inspired directly by the H.G. Wells novella, the basic alien invasion plotline grows exhausted and vapid rather quickly, more so then we would expect from a Spielberg picture. This of course is no fault of either Spielberg or Cruise but perhaps Worlds was not quite the follow-up project they had in mind, or at least audiences did, particularly for the creative duo behind the brilliantly orchestrated Minority Report.Unquestionably Tom Cruise falls just a tad short of the intensely passionate roller coaster performance present within Minority Report, his last collaboration with acclaimed director Steven Spielberg, but nonetheless he appears to be in top form in the role of Ray Ferrier, an immature playboy faced with the onslaught of a devastating alien invasion who must come to grips with his role as a parent and protector of his two children as they make their way to Boston, Massachusetts to reunite with their loved ones. Thrown head first into the position as the lone parental figure for his understandably frightened and juvenile children against his will, Cruise affectionately demonstrates the tremendous difficulty Ray has coming to grips with his long overdue responsibilities and how quickly he must change mentally and emotionally to protect his children, doing whatever is necessary, even if it means sacrificing his own moral fiber, to ensure his children's survival through this ordeal. Cruise's impacting performance is what makes War of the Worlds as emotionally poignant as it is and thanks to Dakota Fanning this fermentation is made even more believable. Dakota Fanning's Rachel Ferrier brings the right level of emotional intensity required for Ray Ferrier to make the incredible transformation from a juvenile playboy to the mature and self-sacrificing parental figure he appears as in the end of the film, though to be fair Miss Fanning's overly intelligent persona in the film can be a bit too much at times to accept her as an average girl living through a devastating event such as this but we'll forgive this oversight in the long run. There exists however a complication involving Justin Chatwin's character, Robbie Ferrier, the smart-alecky and rebellious, though certainly more mature at times, son of Tom Cruise's character. The difficulty lies not with Chatwin's performance. On the contrary, he works perfectly well in the role. Rather the problem exists with the resolution of the character. With no explanation as to how Robbie survived the alien attack when it appeared unmistakably to have led to his death, his appearance at the very end of the film ruins in a way the emotional impact of the reunion between Ray, his ex-wife and Rachael. It feels so out of the blue and unexplained that it vastly overshadows the audience's perception of the picture's finale, thus diluting the message Spielberg is trying to express.Overall, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise's second collaborative effort War of the Worlds lamentably falls short of expectations especially on par with the creative majesty of Minority Report, though undoubtedly this does not come as surprise to many. Nonetheless, the originative and visually stunning first half saves the film from whatever shortcomings its weaker second half, particularly its conclusion, may deliver. Rhetoric stemming from the left side of the political spectrum would dictate that the symbolism presented in Steven Spielberg's big screen adaptation of the classic H.G. Wells novella relates to the American `imperialism' demonstrated in Iraq when in reality it relates to its audience the evils of terrorism and the emotional horror its devastation can invoke in the human psyche.There are overtly distinctive parallels made between the alien invasion/attempted extermination of the entire human race and the aftermath following the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, most notably the scene in which survivors pass a wall covered with pictures of missing loved ones, and the recent terrorist bombings in London. However poignant or familiarly and emotionally entrancing this may seem for some, this unfortunately is where Spielberg goes the most wrong in his direction of War of the Worlds. If anyone has even the slightest memory of the moments after the nation fell under attack in September 2001, in spite of the period of shock and horror at the sight of the Twin Towers collapsing and survivors fleeing the clouds of debris in the streets there existed no state of panic or anarchy as some may have predicted, including the terrorist masterminds behind this devious plot. Unlike Spielberg's conceptualization of a rapacious and hysterical populous shown on the big screen, Americans did not riot, lute, or cause an uprising in the days that followed. This can also be proudly said of the British as well in the aftermath of the blitz bombings. In reality Americans would not have acted as outrageously as Spielberg demonstrates, though undoubtedly they would neither have acted as collectively as they appeared following the attacks of September 11th or the blackout in New York City. In War of the Worlds, they are treated so repugnantly it is as if they were the walking dead straight out of a George A. Romero zombie feature, which ironically could easily be playing a few theatres down from the Steven Spielberg picture. The point of Ray's family surviving through a terrifying ordeal such as the attempted annihilation of the human race comes in loud and clear but he crosses the line in this instance. This does not however act as a total blemish on the film's pristine status but rather more as a sticking point which needs simply to be addressed.Yet another problem existent with the storyline is that in spite of its clear ability to remain in tune with the works of the science-fiction author H.G. Wells it does not present many opportunities in which audiences not knowledgeable of the source material can understand key elements of the alien invasion plotline. Why were humans following the initial attacks by the Martian invaders captured instead of being incinerated as before? What was the deal with the red vein-like objects left behind by the alien machines? Nothing is expressed onscreen that would clue audiences into their significance to the plot or what they are precisely. In spite of a few clear missteps, particularly in the latter half of the science-fiction action drama, War of the Worlds maintains its distinctive Spielberg style which has made his films so successful and enduring over the decades and bolsters an astonishing set of five-hundred special effects shots which alone are worth the price of admission.",4,The Moose Hole - Independence Day

635396,A3R36DZQEWNVJ1,B00005JNTI,Mike Bolts,"[0, 2]","Tom Cruise (Collateral, Vanilla Sky) stars as a hard working man who takes in his 2 kids...a little girl names Rachel, played by Dakota Fanning (Hide and Seek, I Am Sam) and a rebellious teenaged boy named Robbie, played by Justin Chatwin who doesnt even get along with his father. In fact, Cruise doesnt even know that much about his kids but he takes him in and soon after he does, in the sky the weather kinda is a little screwy, Cruise saying: ""That's weird, the wind is pushing towards the storm"". Soon, after, Cruise investigates after lightning strikes 26 times in the same spot, the ground shakes, a church splits in half and out from the ground pops a huge machine with tripod legs. The machine kills the people around them turning them into dust, clothes fly, Cruise flees back to his house where he takes his kids on a little road trip where they try to make it to Boston so they can get to their mom. Disaster strikes even more when the machines multiply and ever city isnt safe from their deadlt onslaught. Fun, Fast remake of the original has some pretty good moments, especially when the machines attack. Tim Robbins (High Fidelity, Nothing To Lose) plays a not so right in the head man who takes Cruise and his daughter into shelter...Robbins is pretty much miscast...Spielberg should of picked someone else and yes that voice narrating at the beginning and end was of course Morgan Freeman. The part where the machine tentical is searching for people in that basement was pretty much like the Raptor in the kitchen in Jurassic Park but Jurassic Park's scene was much better, scarier. The part where the machines are sprayed blood and human insides all over the farm fertilizing it was cool.

635399,AUSATFDSU2INS,B00005JNTI,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[3, 7]","Based on H.G. Wells' novel, War of the Worlds is a big, expensive, unnecessary and unimpressive movie about a pointless and destructive alien invasion. I cannot believe that Steven Spielberg, who I consider one of the best directors of our time, could have made such a clumsy movie. I feel this film was poorly executed, even with that bloated 135 million budget. And I'm sure it will make a gazillion more than that.Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, an immature divorce father with 2 children, the annoying teenage son Robbie and precocious daughter Rachel. The film views the catastrophic events through the eyes of Cruise. The premise: aliens have journeyed millions of miles to attack us, and because of this Cruise keeps the next two hours running and hiding, defending his children of an imminent death.When the alien invasion begins, we learn that many years ago, aliens buried machines all over the Earth and now, they are activate them, killing everybody in their path and sucking our blood. Why? Who knows? Maybe because they felt like it.The movie has almost a nonexistent plot, filled with one-dimensional characters and lots of special effects. Because of its weak story, it doesn't involve us emotionally with the characters, to the point that I didn't care if ANYONE survived at the end. Apparently, the film was made just to present us a succession of -sometimes really good- chasing and hiding scenes from its beginning to the traditional Spielberg's cheesy happy ending (in this case completely unrealistic).There were some wonderful f/x moments, and a great scene where Cruise's character had the only working car around for miles and was mobbed by a crazy group of survivors.I recognized there are some good qualities in War of the Worlds, but for me, they were overshadowed by the HUGE flaws I perceived. Although the visuals and atmosphere were really stunning, and there were truly terrifying moments on the film, the plot inconsistencies, the poor characters and that awfully BAD happy ending damaged the experience.

Although the movie was intentionally shot with some graininess to give it a ""gritty"" look and feel, the Blu-ray presentation is overly grainy, and there is too much brightness that drowns out finer details. In addition, colors are washed out and subdued. The only saving grace of this Blu-ray presentation is the absolutely amazing DTS soundtrack.

And out of curiosity I went to see it myself.The movie was not at all close to what I originally thought it would be. Basically it was an hour and a half of very confusing and unrealistic scenes. Almost every five minutes Tom Cruise and his ""children"" are involved in very risky and lifethreatening situatuions which only they ""magically"" survrive. I can't say that I completely regret seeing it though, at least my friend and I had a good laugh. One of those scenes included where Tom and Dakota were staying in the basement of a house with some other creepy guy, who was ""not at all well"". The part where Tom Cruise was comforting his ""daughter"" and in the background there was the same strange guy sharpening his axe was really funny. Since Tom Crise cried in almost evey scene, the movie seemed more like a one big soap opera.Even thought the movie was silly, I still do give credit where necesary, including the special effects, which, as in every movie directed by Spielberg, were undeniably good.In conclusion, the whole idea of the movie was very confusing, more of a fairy tale. The ending especially, where Tom finally comes to Boston, to find his son by some mistery alive and well. Which to me, just seemed the ""last straw"" because the explosion that followed right after Tom parted with his ""son"" would leave everybody a dead corpse. What was a also brought to my attension was that Boston stayed mostly unaffected, where as the rest of the world seemed to be experiencing this alien disaster all over, since these ""alien machines"" were buried everywhere on earth.Some people are seriously comming to their wits' end.I cannot suggest to watch or not to watch the movie, the choice is completely up to you.Thank you for your time,mirage.",1,Steven Spielberg goes berserk!,1121472000,"07 16, 2005",2005,1940,"['must', 'say', 'was', 'suprised', 'when', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'came', 'papragraph', 'stated', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'new', 'movie', 'War', 'Worlds', 'did', 'not', 'earn', 'much', 'money', 'many', 'had', 'hoped', 'curiosity', 'went', 'see', 'myself.The', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'close', 'what', 'originally', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Basically', 'was', 'hour', 'half', 'very', 'confusing', 'unrealistic', 'scenes', 'five', 'minutes', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'children', 'are', 'involved', 'very', 'risky', 'lifethreatening', 'situatuions', 'only', 'magically', 'survrive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'completely', 'regret', 'seeing', 'least', 'friend', 'had', 'good', 'laugh', 'One', 'scenes', 'included', 'where', 'Tom', 'Dakota', 'were', 'staying', 'basement', 'house', 'other', 'creepy', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'part', 'where', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'comforting', 'daughter', 'background', 'was', 'same', 'strange', 'guy', 'sharpening', 'axe', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'Tom', 'Crise', 'cried', 'almost', 'evey', 'scene', 'movie', 'seemed', 'more', 'one', 'big', 'soap', 'opera.Even', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'silly', 'still', 'do', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'necesary', 'including', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'directed', 'Spielberg', 'were', 'undeniably', 'good.In', 'conclusion', 'whole', 'idea', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'confusing', 'more', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending', 'especially', 'where', 'Tom', 'finally', 'Boston', 'find', 'son', 'mistery', 'alive', 'well', 'Which', 'just', 'seemed', 'last', 'straw', 'explosion', 'followed', 'right', 'Tom', 'parted', 'son', 'would', 'leave', 'everybody', 'dead', 'corpse', 'What', 'was', 'also', 'brought', 'attension', 'was', 'Boston', 'stayed', 'mostly', 'unaffected', 'where', 'rest', 'world', 'seemed', 'be', 'experiencing', 'alien', 'disaster', 'alien', 'machines', 'were', 'buried', 'everywhere', 'earth.Some', 'people', 'are', 'seriously', 'comming', 'wits', 'end.I', 'can', 'not', 'suggest', 'watch', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'choice', 'completely', 'you.Thank', 'time', 'mirage']",N/A

Wells' 1898 classic novel. This version of the story also takes inspiration from Orson Welles' famous 1938 radio play and the iconic 1953 film adaptation. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a working class divorced father of two who has his kids for the weekend while his ex-wife (Miranda Otto) and her new husband are in Boston. An eerie lightning storm hits his New Jersey town and mysteriously knocks out all electrical devices in the area. When Ray goes out into the streets to locate his errant son and investigate the power outages, he witnesses a giant mechanical ""tripod"" rise from the earth, vaporizing humans and crushing everything in its path. Ray takes the only working car he can find and hightails it out of there with his talkative, anxious 10-year-old daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and his resentful teenaged son Robbie (Justin Chatwin).""They're already here."" That's the film's tagline and one of the ways in which it differs from H.G. Wells' book. In the film, the alien tripods have been buried in the earth since pre-history, waiting for their masters to launch an invasion. That kind of paranoia is more menacing than an outright alien invasion. There are a lot of little discontinuities that the audience just has to overlook, like video cameras that work when no other electrical devices will -but I wonder why Steven Spielberg let them pass. This ""War of the Worlds"" is a monster movie in the tradition of ""Godzilla"" and the like: Big, powerful invaders are wreaking havoc and we never know their motivation. They are trying to destroy us, so we try to destroy them, or at least avoid being destroyed ourselves. The plot is that simple, and the film works well and entertains as far as it goes. But ""War of the Worlds"" could have used more in the way of themes. The anti-colonialist tract of H.G. Wells' novel is outdated, so that won't work. A don't-tamper-with-nature idea is awkwardly tacked on in the last minutes of the film. This ""War of the Worlds"" needed some cohesive thread apart from overriding panic. Good science fiction is always allegory.The DVD (DreamWorks 2005 single disc edition): The only bonus feature on the single disc edition is a featurette entitled ""Designing the Enemy"" (14 minutes). Director Steven Spielberg and  several visual effects and animation designers explain the concepts behind the Tripods and aliens and how these creatures were created on film.

Much has been written about his work and this remake of the classic book will only add to that legacy. The movie follows the theme of the book as much as possible, only rejecting plot elements that have become dated, for instance mention of the aliens being from Mars.The setting has changed from England to NJ where Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) lives and works. Many of Spielberg's films feature dysfunctional families and this one is no different. At the onset of the film his ex-wife is dropping off their two kids at his NJ home. She immediately takes issue with the condition and cleanliness of his home. Her observations subtly suggest reasons why they became divorced. Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin play Cruise's children. Chatwin provides a great source of tension as a teenage boy using anger to deal with his fathers absence. But he soon finds a new source for his anger in the aliens. All of the actors do a fine job, the characters are very interesting. And Steven Spielberg skillfully remixes some dialogue from the 100 year old classic book to the present time. Many of the elements in the book are changed a bit- the aliens were here a long time ago and buried several thousand of their advanced killing machines in the ground then. They are now returning to use their machines to wipe us out. Without these variations there would be very little suspense for those who have read the book.The special effects as you may imagine with a Spielberg movie are amazing. The part where while running flat out Ferrier barely avoids getting wiped out by a disintegrating house is my fav. Ray Ferrier changes from a man who didn't even want to be burdened by having the kids for the weekend to a man who will do anything to save them. This at one point includes  purposely letting himself get caught by the aliens. Spielberg has taken a great book, read by countless millions, updated it nicely and faithfully put it onto film without regard for his ego. It's more about the vision & greatness of HG Wells than Spielberg and he knows that.",5,Does honor to great book,1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,2108,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'sci', 'fi', 'movies', 'general', 'Much', 'been', 'written', 'work', 'remake', 'classic', 'book', 'will', 'only', 'add', 'legacy', 'movie', 'theme', 'book', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'only', 'rejecting', 'plot', 'elements', 'have', 'become', 'dated', 'instance', 'mention', 'aliens', 'being', 'Mars.The', 'setting', 'changed', 'England', 'NJ', 'where', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Many', 'Spielberg', 'films', 'feature', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'one', 'different', 'onset', 'film', 'ex-wife', 'dropping', 'off', 'two', 'kids', 'NJ', 'home', 'immediately', 'issue', 'condition', 'cleanliness', 'home', 'observations', 'subtly', 'suggest', 'reasons', 'why', 'became', 'divorced', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'play', 'Cruise', 'children', 'Chatwin', 'great', 'source', 'tension', 'teenage', 'boy', 'using', 'anger', 'deal', 'fathers', 'absence', 'soon', 'new', 'source', 'anger', 'aliens', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'skillfully', 'dialogue', '100', 'year', 'old', 'classic', 'book', 'present', 'time', 'Many', 'elements', 'book', 'are', 'changed', 'bit-', 'aliens', 'were', 'here', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'buried', 'several', 'thousand', 'advanced', 'killing', 'machines', 'ground', 'then', 'are', 'now', 'returning', 'use', 'machines', 'wipe', 'out', 'variations', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'little', 'suspense', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book.The', 'special', 'effects', 'may', 'imagine', 'Spielberg', 'movie', 'are', 'amazing', 'part', 'where', 'running', 'flat', 'Ferrier', 'barely', 'getting', 'wiped', 'out', 'disintegrating', 'house', 'fav', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'changes', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'be', 'burdened', 'having', 'kids', 'weekend', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'one', 'point', 'purposely', 'letting', 'get', 'caught', 'aliens', 'Spielberg', 'taken', 'great', 'book', 'read', 'countless', 'millions', 'updated', 'nicely', 'faithfully', 'put', 'film', 'regard', 'ego', 'more', 'vision', 'greatness', 'HG', 'Wells', 'Spielberg']",N/A
635408,A3IMNZSYDOTTU6,B00005JNTI,"M. Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[3, 9]","I remember earlier this year eagerly awaiting the release of this movie. The theatrical trailer made this film very enticing. I went to see this movie alone, anticipating a lot of action, suspense, scares, thrills, everything you could want in a movie. I love Steven Spielberg films, because he seems to have a recipe that makes most of his movies work quite well. Would the same be true for WAR OF THE WORLDS?Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a divorced, kind of deadbeat, father who gets to have the kids for the weekend, and the kids aren't very excited to be spending the time with him. Ray gives off this aura that he could give two rats about his children, although there's still a hint of heart within his soul. After his ex-wife drops off the kids, Rachel and Robbie (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) just want to get through the weekend without any trouble so they can go back home to their mother. But a freak lightning storm, which is very scary and relentless, suddenly starts to change things, and all of a sudden, chaos erupts as monstrous crafts appear reaching high above and start knocking people off one by one, tearing streets apart, toppling buildings, and creating widespread panic amongst the population. With the sudden change of events, Ray is now forced to seize hold of a minivan that's not even his, and drive off with his children to flee New Jersey and head for safer terrain. They stop at the ex-wife's house, but she's nowhere to be found. They decide to camp for the night, but it's not long before the crafts and the aliens begin to wreak havoc in their neck of the woods. When they wake up the next morning, the neighborhood is destroyed, with only a handful of survivors fleeing to safer places. It's after this point that the movie delves into unbelievable suspense and terror, with the ferry scene being of the best. As the machines start to come into view, the ferry begins to sail off, but there are machines lurking under the water and they rise up in such a menacing way that it's hard not to grab the arm of your seat and flinch. We inevitably lead up to the harrowing basement scene, where we meet Ogilvy (Tim Robbins) and then the fun really begins. Before we meet him, we find the son going out to sacrifice his life while a war is exploding between the machines and the army, military, any person who is willing to just about risk their lives to save mankind from total annihilation. These scenes are incredibly intense, and when we see the aliens trying to hunt down Ogilvy, Ray, and Rachel, it's almost unbearable to watch. Surprisingly, Ogilvy is dispatched of fairly quick when Ray suspects him, and then it's up to Ray and Rachel to reach safe civilization, but when they finally reach Boston after a grueling trip, the machines show up again, but there's one significant finding...they're collapsing, and ultimately, destroy themselves, and finally humans have defeated the aliens. The last shot of the film is strong, as we have a renewed sense of respect for Ray, who now seems to care a lot more than he did in the beginning, and there's a renewed hope for the human race as Rachel runs into the arms of her mother.The special effects in the film are top-notch; the acting is sturdy and solid, with Tom Cruise portraying Ray with realism. We are used to seeing Cruise play good guys, but like his superb role in Collateral, we see a side we haven't seen...and it works to great effect. Dakota Fanning is starting to catch fire too, and she certainly relishes her on-screen time with a big performance. I even liked Tim Robbins character, even though he was a bit slimy and dirty underneath the kind, frail exterior. Never do we see overacting - we believe the fear, the danger, the courage these people are feeling; the story is fairly strong, and I didn't really notice any weakness; and the ending was strong. All throughout the film, Morgan Freeman narrates the movie's beginning and the movie's end, and I thought it was a nice touch to add such an element and presence to a big, gargantuan blockbuster film. This two-disc set is a must-have for any sci-fi fanatic or fan of this film...it just delivers the goods for those of us who feel that, at times, special editions don't give us enough. You'll be treated to gold with this collector's edition.So if you're a big fan of sci-fi, action, even adventure movies, you are absolutely going to love WAR OF THE WORLDS. Steven Spielberg remains one of the most interesting, complex, and superb directors of our time. He encapsulates H.G. Wells vision so well and the cast is solid.

635409,A2UL0A8GJB4318,B00005JNTI,mljkb,"[4, 6]","Although it has been said a thousand times in ""War of the World's"" promotional blitz, it is worth saying again that this ain't your nice Spielberg.  This is ""Jaws,"" ""Jurassic Park"" Spielberg where he hammers the audience with one white-kunckled, heart-racing jolt after another, racheting up tension to an unbearable level.  Even John Williams chilling score echoes strains from a certain shark flick, sending pulses racing even faster.  Spielberg wastes little time, offering up only a brief exposition to introduce Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), a lazy, almost inept father looking after his kids (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) for the weekend while his ex (Miranda Otto) heads off to Boston to be with her parents for the weekend.  All seems normal: Ray cannot connect with his kids and his son take the car out for a joyride.  But all that changes when a strange lightning storm awaken lethal and gargantuan tripods from the Earth.  Before anyones guesses what is going on, the tripods unleash deadly heat rays that incinerate anyone they come in contact with.  The image of Ray covered in the ash of the deceased is a haunting visage of nightmares, and a ghoulish nod to 9/11.  Ray and his kids flee for their lives, trying to go anywhere where they might seek refuge from the ruthless invaders, only to find they roam the countryside, feeding a grisly appetite for live humans.With all the hoopla surrounding Tom Cruise lately, it would seem impossible to look at him on-screen without thinking of the egotistical, self-righteous actor who claimed to be an expert on the complexities of the human brain and the real alien presence among us.  But Cruise does pull off a memorable performance as the deadbeat Ray, perhaps because Ray's boyish attitude toward life mirrors that of Cruise.  Either way, Cruise does get inside Ray in surprising ways, creating a handful of heart-breaking scenes with new-comer Chatwin and the talented-beyond-her-years Fanning.  In the midst of extra-terrestrial mayhem and desparate humans (none moreso than Tim Robbins as a crazy recluse), they provide an emotional core to the film.But above all, this is Spielberg's film, and once he kicks into high gear, he rarely slows down.  And although he recieves immeasurable aid from expert cinematographer Janunz Kaminski and ace editor Michael Kahn, one scene after another are testaments to his incomperable skill for maintaining fast paced thrills and delivering deliberate terrors.  And one sequence after another are testaments to the amazing digital prowess of ILM, who deliver absolutely astounding special effects.  From the methodical carnage of the tripods to the snake-like movements of the aliens and their suveillance technology, the ILM team pull out many a pixelated miracle in bringing the marauding attackers to life.The film overall would prove the perfect summer flick, if only Spielberg and writer David Koepp had not erred in the ending.  Even if the demise of the aliens mirrors H.G. Wells' original text, the finale comes too abrubtly and too sunnily.  The sugary melodramatics of Ray and his family and the all too perfect mass death of the aliens jars with the entire film beforehand, which was as nightmarish and heart-pounding as any movie in recent memory.  Nonetheless, you will be hard pressed to find an equal this summer to the kind of expert thrills and jolts provided so exuberantly by Spielberg and his gifted cast and crew.  Heres' hoping that we are truly alone in the universe.",4,"A Dark and Intense ""War""",1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,3496,"['been', 'said', 'thousand', 'times', 'War', 'World', 'promotional', 'blitz', 'worth', 'saying', 'again', 'ai', ""n't"", 'nice', 'Spielberg', 'Jaws', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Spielberg', 'where', 'audience', 'one', 'white-kunckled', 'heart-racing', 'jolt', 'racheting', 'up', 'tension', 'unbearable', 'level', 'Even', 'John', 'Williams', 'chilling', 'score', 'echoes', 'certain', 'shark', 'flick', 'sending', 'pulses', 'racing', 'even', 'faster', 'Spielberg', 'little', 'time', 'offering', 'up', 'only', 'brief', 'exposition', 'introduce', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'lazy', 'almost', 'father', 'looking', 'kids', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'weekend', 'ex', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'Boston', 'be', 'parents', 'weekend', 'normal', 'Ray', 'can', 'not', 'connect', 'kids', 'son', 'take', 'car', 'out', 'joyride', 'when', 'strange', 'lightning', 'storm', 'awaken', 'lethal', 'gargantuan', 'tripods', 'Earth', 'anyones', 'guesses', 'what', 'going', 'tripods', 'unleash', 'deadly', 'heat', 'rays', 'incinerate', 'anyone', 'come', 'contact', 'image', 'Ray', 'covered', 'ash', 'deceased', 'haunting', 'visage', 'nightmares', 'ghoulish', 'nod', '9/11', 'Ray', 'kids', 'flee', 'lives', 'trying', 'go', 'anywhere', 'where', 'might', 'seek', 'refuge', 'ruthless', 'invaders', 'only', 'find', 'roam', 'countryside', 'feeding', 'grisly', 'appetite', 'live', 'humans.With', 'hoopla', 'surrounding', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'lately', 'would', 'seem', 'impossible', 'look', 'on-screen', 'thinking', 'egotistical', 'self-righteous', 'actor', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'expert', 'complexities', 'human', 'brain', 'real', 'alien', 'presence', 'Cruise', 'pull', 'off', 'memorable', 'performance', 'deadbeat', 'Ray', 'perhaps', 'Ray', 'boyish', 'attitude', 'life', 'mirrors', 'Cruise', 'way', 'Cruise', 'get', 'inside', 'Ray', 'surprising', 'ways', 'creating', 'handful', 'heart-breaking', 'scenes', 'new-comer', 'Chatwin', 'talented-beyond-her-years', 'Fanning', 'midst', 'extra-terrestrial', 'mayhem', 'desparate', 'humans', 'none', 'moreso', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'crazy', 'recluse', 'provide', 'emotional', 'core', 'film.But', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'once', 'high', 'gear', 'rarely', 'down', 'immeasurable', 'aid', 'expert', 'cinematographer', 'Janunz', 'Kaminski', 'ace', 'editor', 'Michael', 'Kahn', 'one', 'scene', 'are', 'testaments', 'incomperable', 'skill', 'maintaining', 'fast', 'paced', 'thrills', 'delivering', 'deliberate', 'terrors', 'one', 'sequence', 'are', 'testaments', 'amazing', 'digital', 'prowess', 'ILM', 'who', 'deliver', 'absolutely', 'astounding', 'special', 'effects', 'methodical', 'carnage', 'tripods', 'snake-like', 'movements', 'aliens', 'suveillance', 'technology', 'ILM', 'team', 'pull', 'out', 'many', 'pixelated', 'miracle', 'bringing', 'marauding', 'attackers', 'life.The', 'film', 'overall', 'would', 'prove', 'perfect', 'summer', 'flick', 'only', 'Spielberg', 'writer', 'David', 'Koepp', 'had', 'not', 'erred', 'ending', 'Even', 'demise', 'aliens', 'mirrors', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'original', 'text', 'finale', 'too', 'abrubtly', 'too', 'sunnily', 'sugary', 'melodramatics', 'Ray', 'family', 'too', 'perfect', 'mass', 'death', 'aliens', 'jars', 'entire', 'film', 'beforehand', 'was', 'nightmarish', 'heart-pounding', 'movie', 'recent', 'memory', 'Nonetheless', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'equal', 'summer', 'kind', 'expert', 'thrills', 'jolts', 'provided', 'so', 'exuberantly', 'Spielberg', 'gifted', 'cast', 'crew', 'Heres', 'hoping', 'are', 'truly', 'alone', 'universe']",N/A

635411,A2FS6OGMZMALTD,B00005JNTI,Mojo Jojo,"[27, 40]","I hesitate to give this movie 1 star, thinking that might be a little harsh.  But then I thought about it and about the film, and sometimes I think I may be being to charitable.Bottom line:  This movie is boring.  It starts out promising.  We meet Cruise, a likable everyman who is about to take care of his kids for the weekend.  Then it all goes to hell.To begin with, I hated these kids.  A couple of spoiled brats who I wished would be disintegrated through the whole film.  They keep yelling at their father, accusing him of being a bad father.  Is he the greatest dad in the world?  No.  Does he deserve this much grief?  Hell, no.  And even after he saves their lives repeatedly they're still on his case.  So I disliked two of the three main characters:  STRIKE ONE.Then there's the Martians.  Where the hell are the Martians?  They hardly show up in the movie at all.  Sure, that makes sense since this family isn't actually fighting the aliens, but just trying to stay alive.  But there were huge stretches of nothing happening.  And terrible scenes of human cruelty and panic.  It's reasonable to expect the worst in people to come out, but I don't want to watch a movie all about people turning on each other.  ""Independence Day"" may get a bad rap, but damn it, at least I was rooting for humanity in that film.  Here, I wanted the Martians to disintegrate us all.  STRIKE TWO.And worst of all for a big budget blockbuster:  it's dreadfully, terribly, unbelievably boring.  Watching people hide from aliens for over two hours is not very exciting.  We don't get to witness one major battle.  There's one scene where the military is fighting some aliens just over a hill.  AND WE DON'T GET TO SEE IT!  Instead, we get another endless scene of Cruise trying to save his stupid kid.  BIG, BIG STRIKE THREE.There's a whole bunch of other things that bugged me about this film.  The happy ending is just tacked on.  The interlude with Tim Robbins as a crazy survivalist is just horribly executed and ulitately pointless.  But what bothers me the most was that they kept the original resolution.Germs killing the Martians in the original book worked fine because it was written in a different era.  But now we know better.  And the Martians, who are far and away our technological superiors, don't know enough not to drink the water and breath our air?  Jeez, when I go to Mexico I don't drink the water.Steven Spielberg has lost his ability to entertain an audience.  Both this and Minority Report are interesting sci fi films that take themselves way too seriously and drag on way too long.Blech, I say.

635415,A2XVA2OGDYKKD,B00005JNTI,Monsieur Valentine,"[1, 1]","Watching this Spielberg movie I realised that we have come to a point in television where we can just about do anything. The special effects were absolutely stunning. Buildings collapsing, cars flying, ships sinking, the pure adrenaline rush alone will keep you in awe.But!!There comes a time in everyone's life, where special effects alone no longer amount to much. I think I got this awakening some time before finishing highschool, around about the time 'Indepence Day' spread its tentacles all over cinema stadiums. I walked away then for the first time thinking... that ending wasn't 'cool'. Ever since I havent looked back. Countless big blockbuster movies that fail to satisfy my thirst for substance.War of the Worlds begins interstingly enough, as do most science fiction blockbusters, but its science comes toppling down as quick as the buildings themselves. It would have only taken a day of brainstorming to inspire a credible science behind martian invasion, but it seems the bugdet didnt allow for this. Instead its traded for a wooden (scientologist MD) Tom Cruise who is left to babysit an annoying little girl and a spoilt brat of a son. So in the end, a world event is told in the perspective of one man, who's aim is to get to the safeside of Boston. Do I care if they make it to Boston? NO! Is it an anticlimax to see the spoilt brat alive at then end? Most certainly it was.Millions of poeple dying, a civilsation in ruins, and a selfish Spielberg tells a selfish story of a selfish man, on a journey to save his own selfish butt. Sure that's a perspective. But an overdone one at that (remember 'Day after Tomorrow').The most interesting moments come when we witness the collapse of not buildings but the moral-social infrastructure. Wathcing the birth of post-apocalypse. As humans turn on themselves, and finally squeeze a tear from Tom Cruise. The realisation was though provoking.And as the movie reached the 2 hour mark, it was obvious we were going to see an abrupt ending, flawed like its predecessor. Humans have earned their place on earth, evolution has brought about a delicate ecosytem that is much more impermeable than meets the eye. At least to the eye of our friendly martians. It seems, this advance race had not studied the principles of evolution (namely Bacteria) before they embarked on their conquest. OOOPS. At least in the original, we were explained a little more. The martians were of a primitive cellular make up.Another fiction in its science... where did the machines come from. If they seeded 1000 years ago, would no man ever find them. We have oil rigs that drill deep underground, machines that will tell us the composition of material below our feet. No one realised? And why would E.T. wait 1000 years for humans to evolve before invading it.I could have forgiven Speilberg for his blunders, and hoped maybe we could have seen a sequel.

Speilberg does a more than superb job giving us a great fear of these aliens attacking us. From the music to the script to the effects, this movie is a surefire blockbuster.The acting was great on all counts. Tom Cruise was terrific as this dead-beat dad pouring his heart out into saving his kids. Nobody else can scream like Dakota Fanning, and Tim Robbins is absolutely superb as a troubled prepard to fight the aliens.There are two things in this movie that truly make it great: the special effects w/the aliens and the tension. I won't spoil anything but there is a scene in a basement with Tom, Dakota, and Robbins that is so incredibly tense I literally started to shake. Spielberg literally brings true edge-of-your-seat tension and fear to this story. The aliens have incredible detail though, from a distance, they look like aliens you'd see in a 50's sci-fi show. But don't underestimate that they truly bring strong fear to me and citizens of Earth.Hats off to Spielberg!

Non-stop action from this point. Boring. In the original War Of The Worlds, the Martians came here inside huge meteors. Just think what modern CGI could have done with thousands of these meteors ripping throughout all the skies of the world. And then in the original, the meteor's ""door"" unscrewing like a jar lid. Fifty-two years later, I still can't think of this scene in bed at night! That's great movie-making!The Basement Scene: I think just there for exposition of the plot. The Martians drop in for a drink of water. Not nearly as scary as the originals. Basically the same monsters from Independence Day.Why are they always the color of mud or steel? The originals in 1953 were pink with 3 primary colored eyes and unformed, embryonic faces. Whoa! I didn't sleep for a month after I saw the original! Speilberg's Martians have nearly Oriental human faces. Not spooky whatsoever. Seen it before.And later after the useless basement scene (with the soft, babyfaced Tim Robbins who I can't stand even more than I can't stand Tom Cruise), Cruise jumps into an old pickup (the only car around) and it just HAPPENS to have a couple of live HAND GRENADES!!! in the glove compartment. How many people do you know on this planet who carry HAND GRENADES!!! in the glove compartment??!! I mean,Jeez, I don't even think there's a mention of them in any DMV handbook!Unlike the first WOTW, this movie does not evoke suspense. The machines just burst out of the ground.Well,there they are...So,OK... Not even as scary as the original ones and even though you could see the strings in the older version , the ships seemed alive, so other-worldly and filled with mighty nasty aliens. Plus the quiet, UFO sound they made was downright chilling!The one really scary thing of this movie was what the ""red stuff"" was coming out of the ships. I had some bad dreams over that. We don't find out what this is until nearly the end. If they had told us what the stuff was up front, it would have made a huge impact: meaning DON'T let these Martians catch you at any cost!

635425,AL4KX6X24YSS,B00005JNTI,MurphysLaw,"[12, 16]","War of the Worlds is not a bad movie, but it isn't exactly a good one either.  The special effects are impressive, the movie is more or less true to the story, although Spielberg got a little creative here and there but hey, it's Spielberg so let's just run with it, right?  I mean, if Spielberg did it, it'll be awesome, right?  Wrong.If you are going to change the story around and create completely new characters, wouldn't you at least expect the characters to be interesting?  Well, forget it.  In my opinion, Spielberg is one of the best directors in terms of character development.  War of the Worlds has viturally NO character development from start to finish.  Tom Cruise's acting is flat and his character is so far from interesting it's pathetic.  In fact, even his self-absorbtion is difficult to follow.  I kept waiting for that big movie moment when Cruise's character would have a revelation and therefore make him less disgusting.  Nope, it never happened.  He did make it to Boston though.As for the kids, forget it.  Robbie, the annoying son that for some inexplicable reason is determined to put everyone in jeapordy for his quest to kill the aliens, grates on your nerves from start to finish.  He disappears about 2/3 of the way through the movie into a huge explosive battle between the military and the aliens and then just magically arrives safe and sound in Boston without a scratch and before his father and sister get there. I also wondered how the city of Boston could be in flames and virtually destroyed but the charming townhouse where Ray's pregnant ex-wife and her parents are is as good as  new.  They should sell that place...it's the only block in town that is alien free.Rachel, the equally annoying daughter, has more high-pitched whiney screams than lines.  We watch her order health food.  We see her prized ribbon.  We see her funky clothing.  We hear her wise-beyond-her-years comments.  We don't care. We want her to stop screeching at the top of her lungs.  We want the aliens to get her just so she'll shut up!The only character of any interest is Ogilvey, whom we are supposed to despise because he is putting everyone in danger with his crazy misguided plans.  Of course, Robbie just did that same thing but we're supposed to forget that.  First off, why did Ogilvey go out of his way to flag Ray and Rachel down so they could come into some house he took over when countless others were left running through a field, exposed and getting picked off one by one?  NO one else thought to hide in that house?  No, I'd stay exposed in a field while giant tripods skewered everyone.  Too bad, Ogilvey is the only character that doesn't make you start rooting for the aliens.  This character should have been developed more as well.  But hey, why bother when we have a great tentacle scene coming up?  Ooh, and don't forget the aliens will be along shortly to spin a bicycle wheel and look at some old photos. Of course, Ray the 5'6"" superdad will be able to kick his butt even though Ogilvey is crazy, sports a shovel, an axe and a gun and has already smacked superdad upside the head and out-wrestled him before.  But then again, superdad has to kill him...otherwise his quiet crazy mutterings will arouse the aliens supicions...unlike the repeated shrill squeals from his daughter.Normally, I accept science fiction films for what they have become...special effect eye candy, but with Spielberg at the helm, I really expected much more and I doubt I was the only one.

So I am just going to give my views here, knowing many people will disagree and many will agree.The film has the opportunity to be brilliant. It starts out slow, with the usual separated couple and displaced kids so comon in many movies nowadays.  And it starts out slowly, building to wonderful visual effects and a floor rattling sound track.  All quite impressive and the kind of stuff that gets you really into the movie.Then the theme reverts back to the disfunctional family theme with different renditions of the same floor rattling stuff with a bit of suspense thrown in.From here, suspese is all that keeps it going.  And the commentary on human nature. The film turns grey (if not dark) and it seems to start slowing down to an almost interminable plod - the worst part of which takes place in a basement - a place of refuge - a scene which goes on...and on....and on.Somehow - to me - it got bogged down into the doldrums at this point and never really made it out of them, although it gave a couple of well-intentioned but half hearted lurches.In the end, I guess I was not terribly impressed.  The film takes huge liberties with the book and almost gives the impression of a tale told by story tellers who are tired of telling the same old story.I think it could have been a lot better.

While pulling up abit short of it's finishing line, it still manages to remain perhaps my favourite Spielberg film.A modern day dystopian anti-hero sci-fi invasion & destruction of society is what the journey on offer here is, & in a Genre way the film's trip does an incredible job of walking down this path while it is on it. From the hiding in cellars to running from tri-pod mayhem, it's superb fun, again in a Genre way.War of the Worlds is not really a film upon which the Director has become identified with so much - those of the heart tugging or the wide eyed wonder stories - but it is Genre films, and particularly slightly weird & dystopian sci-fi ones at that, which i think gives Steven Spielberg another kind of balance as a film maker, Minority Report & AI being other examples of this type which i prefer in his works.Some of the inspiration in the film comes from the 9/11 event, some times in a curious homage to that also, as well as the holocaust of WW2s in-humanity, and as such it draws upon echoes of that event & the Schindler's List film, as well as containing a refinement of his film making from such films as Jurassic Park, with a hide and seek basement scene that totally tops the similar one from Jurassic Park.It seems we are only two thirds of the way through the natural rhythm of the narrative when it suddenly concludes though, in that it dramatically reaches its peak as the full telling of the entire set up of the plot, only to quickly end the Genre fun. Essentially the full scale of the situation and the supremacy of the tri-pod invasion is reached, people are at a loss and everyone is acting quirky - this is where the film is at it's full potential and most interesting environmentally & otherwise, but it gets wrapped up very quickly from this point where another 15 minutes exploring this terrain would have really enhanced it's obvious Genre impact of being a great stylistic imaginative adventure.There is the mushiness but it is more in a Genre way or aspect of the story telling rather than being the story telling, and able to be enjoyed in that way with the characters, who are nuanced but not deep, which suits this style of story.The film does an amazing job of the War of the Worlds invasion in a modern setting, because when it is bringing this to life, which when it does is superb, the modern setting is lost and it simple becomes a timeless sci-fi type of Genre adventure.- this is for the two disc edition which if you like the film, has interesting extras -",5,One of Spielberg's most specialised modern Genre films,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,2659,"['BIG', 'part', 'story', 'film', 'Genre', 'updated', 'imaginative', '50s', 'sci-fi', 'watched', 'spirit', 'fantastic', 'adventure', 'pulling', 'up', 'abit', 'short', 'finishing', 'line', 'still', 'remain', 'perhaps', 'favourite', 'Spielberg', 'film.A', 'modern', 'day', 'dystopian', 'anti-hero', 'sci-fi', 'invasion', 'destruction', 'society', 'what', 'journey', 'offer', 'here', 'Genre', 'way', 'film', 'trip', 'incredible', 'job', 'walking', 'down', 'path', 'hiding', 'cellars', 'running', 'tri-pod', 'mayhem', 'superb', 'fun', 'again', 'Genre', 'way.War', 'Worlds', 'not', 'really', 'film', 'Director', 'become', 'identified', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'tugging', 'wide', 'eyed', 'wonder', 'stories', 'Genre', 'films', 'particularly', 'slightly', 'weird', 'dystopian', 'sci-fi', 'ones', 'i', 'think', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'kind', 'balance', 'film', 'maker', 'Minority', 'Report', 'AI', 'being', 'other', 'examples', 'type', 'i', 'prefer', 'works.Some', 'inspiration', 'film', '9/11', 'event', 'times', 'curious', 'homage', 'also', 'as', 'well', 'holocaust', 'WW2s', 'in-humanity', 'such', 'echoes', 'event', 'Schindler', 'List', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'containing', 'refinement', 'film', 'making', 'such', 'films', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'hide', 'seek', 'basement', 'scene', 'totally', 'similar', 'one', 'Jurassic', 'Park.It', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'thirds', 'way', 'natural', 'rhythm', 'narrative', 'when', 'suddenly', 'dramatically', 'peak', 'full', 'telling', 'entire', 'set', 'plot', 'only', 'quickly', 'end', 'Genre', 'fun', 'Essentially', 'full', 'scale', 'situation', 'supremacy', 'tri-pod', 'invasion', 'reached', 'people', 'are', 'loss', 'everyone', 'acting', 'quirky', 'where', 'film', 'full', 'potential', 'most', 'interesting', 'environmentally', 'otherwise', 'wrapped', 'up', 'very', 'quickly', 'point', 'where', '15', 'minutes', 'exploring', 'terrain', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'enhanced', 'obvious', 'Genre', 'impact', 'being', 'great', 'stylistic', 'imaginative', 'mushiness', 'more', 'Genre', 'way', 'aspect', 'story', 'telling', 'rather', 'being', 'story', 'telling', 'able', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'nuanced', 'not', 'deep', 'suits', 'style', 'story.The', 'film', 'amazing', 'job', 'War', 'Worlds', 'invasion', 'modern', 'setting', 'when', 'bringing', 'life', 'when', 'superb', 'modern', 'setting', 'lost', 'simple', 'timeless', 'sci-fi', 'type', 'Genre', 'adventure.-', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'like', 'film', 'interesting', 'extras']",N/A

Wells' on which this movie is loosely based, and all I could think during long stretches of this film was ""he must have rolled clear out of his grave over this mess"".Tom Cruise plays ultra-macho Ray Ferrier, a completely unsympathetic anti-hero who, at the opening of the movie, struts about the screen, playing the macho-mechanic-man with as much bravura as I display when faced with a root canal.  His ex-wife deposits their children with him for a visit; he proceeds to alienate them both quite neatly by being himself (i.e., a smug, self-satisfied jerk-wad).  So it's ""Boo, you're a bad father, Ray!"" for the first moments -- then, right down the street, an alien spaceship is disgorged from the earth .Fascinating.  An enormous UFO literally erupts out of the ground, yet dozens of local idiots are standing about, staring, even taking in the action on videorecorders.  Was I the sole viewer screaming, ""Run, you freaking MORONS!  R-U-N!!!"", when beholding this mass idiocy...?!Then Ray collects his terrified kids and the viewer is subjected to the very first of a seemingly endless round of screaming fits pitched by Miss Dakota Fanning.  (ASIDE -- I really find this young actress to be very talented; unfortunately, she over-acted the role of Rachel in ""War"" to astronomical proportions).  Rachel Ferrier, Ray's clever, world-wise daughter, is also afflicted with an anxiety disorder.How Mr. Spielberg thought this would ""enhance"" the plot is utterly beyond me.  ANYONE would be shouting and trilling at the sight of alien pod-walkers vaporizing people and such.  But no, Rachel misses Mommy and cannot function unless a sense of calm and control is surrounding her at every moment.  So even when the little Clan Ferrier is removed from the presence of death rays and falling airline jets, Miss Screamy-Pants can't keep her yap shut and insists on tears, whining, and bad drama all around.Nice, Rach.Ray and his Miss Scream-A-Lot (and his son, whose character is so colorless I don't even recall his name at the moment) magically find the single working vehicle in town and tear out to Boston.  They are heading to Beantown because Ray really does want to unload  his offspring on their responsible, functional parent as soon as humanly possible (an angry charge the Invisible Son makes at Daddy at one point, with which I totally agree) and that's where his ex-wife is, at her parents'.Next comes sequence after mind-numbing sequence of running, shrieking crowds attempting to flee the death rays of the pod-stalkers.  Rachel has numerous breakdowns.  Ray makes nice by singing ""Little Deuce Coupe"" to his mentally-deranged daughter in place of a real lullaby.  Thousands of hapless people are incinerated.  Others, perhaps not so fortunate, have themselves turned into ""human smoothies"", and their blood and guts serve as fuel for the pod-stalkers.Tasty.There is an unbelievable plot point about the son that doesn't merit mention.  The ""abandoned house"" scenes with Tim Robbin are slightly interesting -- more so than all the running and mass hysteria, in any event.  A good action film will supply much-needed ""resting moments"" [such as the abandoned house sequence, which is one of perhaps three] for the audience to catch its breath from the hurly-burly of mass destruction.  ""W.o.t.W"" doesn't have near enough of them.Many hours later we are bluntly told by the cloying voiceover of Morgan Freeman that all the aliens dropped dead after having been exposed to viruses humans have been immune to for centuries.Nice denouement.  Hours of monster-packed mayhem and within two minutes they're all keeling over...?  Dude!  What the hell?!And why couldn't James Earl Jones have done the voice?  It's so superior.  I simply can't stand Morgan's vocal cords.  Yucko.All in all this movie was atrocious.  Mr. Cruise is not only unlikable, but his ""transformation"" from self-obsessed grease monkey to Father of the Year rang cheap and false.And Dakota Fanning should really consider doing voiceovers for fun-houses and haunted castle rides the world over.

Buildings explodes, cars get flipped over, total chaos.That's what happens, and as people are getting vaporized right and left of him, Ray goes back home to get his kids and takes off to Boston because he really doesn't know what else to do.They see just how much damage the machines have done not only to the Country, but also to the people themselves.People are fighting each other and even killing each other over resources.I don't want to give away too much of the movie, but flat out, it's awesome.One father's love for his daughter, played by Dakota Fanning and his son Robbie.In the end, it wasn't mankind's weapons that killed off the machines, nor their technology.It was the work of God Almighty, by placing on this Earth bacteria and micro-organisms that took care of the machines. The things we take for granted ultimately, is what saved mankind in the end.great story line, great overall theory.

The ending is even less spectacular than Independence Day because (spoiler) the aliens die ""naturally"" of some kind of disease they contract.

This is what I believe (based on common sense), but unlike the other message of the movie, I don't believe that we are in any danger of them. On the contrary, I believe we are merely being watched for our development and progress.

OK,IM GOING TO LET OFF LOTS OF SPOILERS,SO MOVE ON TO NEXT REVIEW........YOUVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!  morgan freeman pimped himself in his lame a$$ed role as narrator.2 minutes in the beginning to set it up(which wasnt awfull but come on morg,youre above this sort of role)and then a laughable 2 minute explanation at the end,which is without a doubt,THE WORST ENDING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ok,got lame guy morg out,next...the beginning;was the best part.everything made sense in this half hour span.the nonchalantness of it all was perfect.if you pay attention,youll even find out SS tossed in a yankees shout out:''lightning struck the same spot 26 times''-ie 26 titles.tom cruise sports a yankees cap while his annoying son dons a red sox cap.seeing dakota fannings big head almost made me throw up but i gave her a chance.shes toms daughter.tom did adequately.he had so little to work with you almost feel sorry.ok,now the attack.good,not great,considering its PG-13.it seems that these tripods were placed underground throughout the planet before mankind was here and the lightning were actually transporters.......THEN WHY DIDNT THE DAMNED ALIENS TAKE EARTH OVER THEN?!?!?!MUST THEY HAVE TO WAIT TO BATTLE WHOEVER CAME NEXT?!?!?!INHABIT THE DAMNED THING!!!!!!!SHEESH!!!!!now you only see the north east coast(ny,mass,conn)being attacked.bad move.it would have made the movie feel more dire if we actually saw THE WORLD(not a couple of cities)getting attacked.and how about the planet that launched this mission in the 1st place?!?!?seeing dunce cap models running back and forth gets tired really fast!the actual tripods themselves were pretty disappointing as well.but seeing how they laid waste to us humans was cool.but couldnt aliens figure out a way of offing us more than 1 ray beam at a time?theyre turning humans into dust but not the clothing one at a time.thats stupid.even us humans can wipe out many in 1 shot.now only toms charactor ray ferrier was able to figure out how to start a car up after the aliens stopped all from operating.toms 40something year old scientological brain out thought the aliens!!!!!!!!!!way to go!!!!!!!and it only took him about 2 seconds to do it.not a biggie,they just drive to another location just to run around and yell at each other.SS throw another actor a bone,tim robbins.his part as a helpfull redneck was a bigger bone than the one morgan was tossed.he was doing fine until he invited tom and dakota into his basement(this kid has some screaming power,didnt lose her voice when ALL SHE DID WAS CRY AND SCREAM!!!!!!!CAN AN ALIEN PLEASE SHUT HER UP?!?!?!?)tom kills/beats the redneck soon after because he was risking toms and dakotas safty.....IN HIS OWN BASEMENT!!!!!hey tom,dakota,IF YOU FEEL UNSAFE IN A REDNECKS BASEMENT......F%@#ING LEAVE!!!!!!!LIKE YOU DID ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU BEAT/KILLED SAID HELPFULL REDNECK!!!!!!WTF!!!!!its important to note that the redneck had an axe that could damage alien probes.tom successfully attacks one.at this point,his even more annoying son,who calls tom by his first name''ray'',had ran off to''look''at the destruction the aliens were wreaking.it was a tender moment....you see tom leaving dakota at a tree while AGAINS chases down and wrestles said annoying son.tom-''listen,stay with me!(this must have been the millionth time tom told the kid)''kid-''dad......i have to see this....''-pan to tree where more helpfull people try to remove dakota.tom sees this.heres where it gets tender.does tom keep wrestling with a kid that will eventually kill them all before he runs away and watch as the strangers take dakota?or does he let the twit go ''see'' and save the yelling and crying big headed dakota?even the aliens were curious.yes tom lets the annoying son go.now youre wishing,please let the chump see a tripods foot up close and personal and let it be done in slow motion.nope.theres plenty of BS before the KING OF ALL BS ENDINGS.while collecting hapless humans,they(the aliens)inexplicably.......die.like a day after the war started,it ends.just like that.explanation....cue morg....''million of years of our lifestyle,the food we ate and drank,killed

The effects are great, the acting is ok, and the mix of elements selected from the book and the re-imagined sections are pretty good. BUT.... just like Independence Day, you have 2/3 of a good film and 1/3 cack. The ending defies belief, with Tom Cruises estranged family greeting the weary travellers in woolly jumpers at the un-damaged front door of their pricey brownstone in Back-Bay Boston! They only needed to be holding mugs of hearty broth and smoking pipes for the scene to be complete. Which is a shame because there is a lot to like in the movie, Speelers has obviously tried to concentrate on the human element of the story and he manages this pretty well.The idea that the aliens had ""pre-positioned"" equipment was a bit crappy to be honest, why hadn't sewer or mining works discovered any of these previously? He would have been better doing the meteorite story more like the Wells version.But if you remember the Wells version, the dialog was something like this.Monday - ""I encountered one of the Martian machines near the cricket pitch, the vexatious contraption had actually trod on the square making the wicket prepared for next Sundays game against Little Tuddlesdown quite unplayable. Fortunately, the one that last weekends match against Higher Lowerdown was played on remains in fair condition, and with a bit of rolling and cutting, should be acceptable for the game. The Vicar will not be pleased though. I am down to my last 4 clean collars.""Obviously this sort of stuff is not going to lead to a gripping film, particularly for U.S. audiences and I feel that Speelers therefore made a decent fist of re-imagining the book to a modern setting.

We all would like it, but it is a dream. JUST a dream.He used to be such a gifted storyteller, now he is just a pompous and pretentious preacher.What a pity.Not even contributions, like those of Tom Cruise, as the estranged hard-working father, are enough to be convincing.He is far better off with movies such as ""Mission Impossible"" or Dramas like ""Collateral"". He was even impressive in ""Minority Report"" and ""The Last Samurai"".But not in ""War of the Worlds"", in which ""small"" America suffers the full brunt of an Alien invasion from (Mars?).After recent discoveries on Mars, we know that there may be a ""hint"" of primitive life on it, but not a colony of alien fellons.If this was meant to be an adaptation of H.G. Wells' Classic, and an updated one, as it appears to be, why not chose another Planet, another Galaxy altogether?Besides, the theme has been revisited many times over.Remember the '80s miniseries ""V - Visitors"" and more recently Gene Roddenberry's own ""Earth - Final Conflict""?Even the vast world of Star Trek had approached it, with the Borg invasion of Planet Earth in ""First Contact"" and many episodes of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"".Was it truly necessary to revisit the same theme again?And wouldn't it have been refreshing to have the original setting kept intact in period and location?Then yes, it would probably have worked.But like this?What's the necessity, where's the meaning?There's even a cameo by a very gifted actor/director in its own right: Tim Robbins.What good did it do? Nothing.After seeing him in ""The Shawshank Redemption"", I didn't expect him to fall so low as to accept a role such as the one offered to him here. He must truly be desperate to do so.Besides, correct me if I am wrong, haven't we already visited Mars a couple of times, with ""Red Planet"" and ""Mission to Mars"", and while we are at it, in the first we had a mad robot gone beserk, but no Martians, in the second, we had a ""friendly"" Alien race waiting for us. Not only that, but it appeared to have ""created"" us. After our short visit to the Red Planet, one left the surface of Mars with them, while the others returned safely home.No Aliens were left there.But no, Steve Spielberg is still convinced of the necessity to bring back ""the Martians"". Maybe he sees the Martians as a sort of intergalactic Al Qaida. Maybe.Instead, the version filmed in 1953, in full Cold War period, was a short, innocent and very entertaining version of the tale.George Pal and Byron Haskin were true storytellers and sci-fi visionaries. Their teaming-up was a touch of genius and the sparks still come through when watching the old version.Of course, even the original did not stick religiously to the original tale, but the threat was felt as far more real, than in Spielberg's misguided version.Even the idea, in the new movie, to have them here, on Earth, as ""sleepers"", waiting for a signal from above, is ridiculous at best.Why do we have Security Agencies in every country?And it is a wonder that a contractor never ""banged"" against such humongous machines, in the process of rewiring and reconnecting the bowels underneath our streets.Cable companies beware!When digging your cables underneath the earth, be careful not to wake up Mr. Martian Monster...C'mon! Really...Also, during various chase scenes, in which the Alien machines are hunting down human beings as if they were fastidious mosquitoes and ""dusting"" them off the face of the Planet, we get Tom Cruise always managing to walk away, totally unscathed, not even a burn, a scratch. Nothing...Wow, we've got Superman here! Unfortunately, he forgot his working suit at home...Also irritating is the constantly pounding music, if one can call this music, despite the fact that it was Spielberg's friend, John Williams who composed it.Long gone are the days of the freshness of ""Star Wars"" or the dissonant harmonies of ""Close Encounters"", or even the tenseness of ""Jaws"".Now, it is just noise, a fastidious, bombastic noise.No, from a cinematic point of view, this is just plainly, crap.Sorry for the harshness of the word, but I cannot find a better one to define something like this.Or perhaps yes: RIDICULOUS.Is this better?Why then, did you give it 2 stars?Just because they made the effort.Not Spielberg, not Tom Cruise, not John Williams, but rather all the hundreds of people who were involved, in one way or another, in this ordeal of a movie.If you want my passionate point of view, stay away from this DVD at all costs and concentrate yourselves instead on the 1953 version to be absolutely put in your collection.Even the Martians would be grateful for your effort.",2,War of the Worlds - A Comparison,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,5467,"['What', 'disappointment.Thanks', 'intellect', 'was',

Takes the human right out of your clothes!  :)Tom Cruise stars in what could be his worst movie ever.  Granted, it's through no fault of Tom's that the movie sucks so much.  The writing couldn't be saved no matter who starred in this.The basic story: Before the dawn of man, aliens bury their ships in the earth's surface while studying the planet and its inhabitants for the next few.. millenia from outer space.  Fast forward to present day: Earth is bombarded with electro-magnetic storms, while our freaked-out hero, Tom, is a dead-beat dad (we'd have to ask Nicole Kidman if this is a big stretch for him) who's kids despise him.Most sci-fi movies usually have the attacked city's IQ pretty low; but, this is WAY too low.  The following isn't the actual script.  I'm just giving you an idea: ""Hey!  We're having an earthquake!  Let's stick around!  Hey!  Buildings are falling apart!  Let's watch it!  Hey!  Aliens are flying around and zapping people into oblivion (except their clothes)!  Let's *ZAP*!!""Dakota Fanning plays Tom's daughter in the movie.  The actor that plays his son is completely forgettable.  Anyway, back to Dakota.  Speilberg has her screaming about every 30 seconds in the movie.  And, when she isn't screaming, she's yelling at such a high octave that fingernails on a blackboard would sound more soothing to the ears.Tim Robbins makes a guest appearance as one of the survivors in this movie; but his participation couldn't save it either.  The smartest actor in this was Morgan Freeman who does the Twilight Zone-style narration in the beginning and end without actually being IN the movie.  Smart move, Morgan.The only reason I gave this two stars instead of zero stars was because of the great special effects which are par for the course in Speilberg's movies.Movie warnings: Tom Cruise attempting to sing the Beach Boys' 'Little Deuce Coupe', profanity, slightly morbid death by lasers, incredibly annoying stupidity by the townsfolk, and remnants of the movies 'Signs' and 'Independence Day'.That critic that said this is Speilberg's best movie ever needs a lobotomy.Movie question:  If aliens took the power out of EVERYTHING electrical in a city, how are the camcorders working?",2,Don't waste your money!,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,2303,"['review', 'brought', 'new', 'ZAP', 'cleaner', 'cleaning', 'power', 'lasers', 'human', 'right', 'clothes', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'Granted', 'fault', 'Tom', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'writing', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'saved', 'matter', 'who', 'starred', 'this.The', 'basic', 'story', 'dawn', 'man', 'bury', 'ships', 'earth', 'surface', 'studying', 'planet', 'inhabitants', 'next', 'few..', 'millenia', 'outer', 'space', 'Fast', 'forward', 'present', 'day', 'Earth', 'bombarded', 'electro-magnetic', 'storms', 'freaked-out', 'hero', 'Tom', 'dead-beat', 'dad', ""'d"", 'have', 'ask', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'big', 'stretch', 'who', 'kids', 'despise', 'him.Most', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'usually', 'have', 'attacked', 'city', 'IQ', 'pretty', 'low', 'WAY', 'too', 'low', 'following', ""n't"", 'actual', 'script', ""'m"", 'just', 'giving', 'idea', ""'re"", 'having', 'earthquake', 'Let', 'stick', 'around', 'Hey', 'Buildings', 'are', 'falling', 'apart', 'Let', 'watch', 'Hey', 'Aliens', 'are', 'flying', 'around', 'zapping', 'people', 'oblivion', 'clothes', 'Let', '*ZAP*', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Tom', 'daughter', 'movie', 'actor', 'son', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'Anyway', 'back', 'Dakota', 'Speilberg', 'screaming', '30', 'seconds', 'movie', 'when', ""n't"", 'screaming', 'yelling', 'high', 'octave', 'blackboard', 'would', 'sound', 'more', 'soothing', 'ears.Tim', 'Robbins', 'guest', 'appearance', 'one', 'survivors', 'movie', 'participation', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'either', 'smartest', 'actor', 'was', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'Twilight', 'Zone-style', 'narration', 'beginning', 'end', 'actually', 'being', 'IN', 'movie', 'Smart', 'move', 'Morgan.The', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'zero', 'stars', 'was', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'par', 'course', 'Speilberg', 'movies.Movie', 'warnings', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'attempting', 'sing', 'Beach', 'Boys', ""'Little"", 'Deuce', 'Coupe', 'profanity', 'slightly', 'morbid', 'death', 'lasers', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'stupidity', 'townsfolk', 'remnants', 'movies', ""'Independence"", ""Day'.That"", 'critic', 'said', 'Speilberg', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'lobotomy.Movie', 'question', 'aliens', 'took', 'power', 'EVERYTHING', 'electrical', 'city', 'how', 'are', 'camcorders', 'working']",N/A
635456,A2SR4GHSL5CDWA,B00005JNTI,"Paul Wetor ""Wisconsin Programmer""","[2, 4]","I liked this movie even more after my second viewing than my first.  When I know the plot beforehand, I often see movies twice:  once to see it as I *expected* it to be, and once to see it for what it actually is.  Although I still would like to see a well-done version of the original H.G. Wells story, this is a chilling horror movie with many references to 9/11, which makes it uncomfortably relevant.The Wells story tells the events from the point of view of one person who witnessed the start, and survived to see the finish.  I give Spielberg credit for having the guts to keep it as faithful to that as possible.It's not the standard we-win-in-the-end-because-we-always-have storyline.  This bothers quite a few fellow reviewers, apparently, but that's the point.  We've seen disaster movies before, where people had the misfortune to be in the wrong place (boat/plane/building) at the wrong time.  In this story, *every* place is the wrong place!  Are you safer by staying put or by running?  Are you safer by taking action or by standing still?  Will your fellow humans rescue you or doom you?Unsettling questions, unsettling movie.Minor quibbles:  Spielberg's homage to his own ""Empire Of The Sun"" with another ""enemy foot in the puddle of water"".  The musical note similarity to ""Close Encounters"".  The lack of a cool heat-ray sound effect.Pleasant surprise:  Music that is sparse, but is very effective when used.

635457,A3QRUU8SKSH5MP,B00005JNTI,Peter Simone,"[15, 20]","This was one of the few movies this year that I was genuinely pumped up to see.  In this case, it just makes the letdown that much worse.  The movie starts off well enough, setting up the backstory and establishing Tom Cruise as a divorced father of a teenage son and ten year old daughter.  The kids are visiting with him when a storm rolls through.  Lightning hits the same spot 26 times (with no thunder, which bothers me because it is scientificlly impossible).  Things look promising as the tripod emerges from under the streets and opens fire, but it quickly goes downhill.  Another peeve of mine is when  the main character is running, and the trail of destruction stays ten feet behind him.  It is a visually stunning, multimillion dollar trail, but it makes for a rather unbelievable situation, as everyone nearly everyone around him is vaporized, and he escapes without a scratch.  It's also peculiar that the explosions stop right before he gets into the house, and start up immediately after he starts driving.  I had trouble getting into this sequence.  There were just too many coincidences and close calls for it to be believable.  I won't give away any more, but lets just say that this trend continues through the whole movie.  Also, nothing is explained in this movie.  Not a word on why, for example, when the pilot of the tripod gets sick, the shields go down.  Or what the aliens are doing with all of that blood they are harvesting.  Is it food, fuel, fertilizer for the mysterious red veins that carpet the landscape?  They tell us nothing.  Or try to wrap your mind around this one.  Why do the aliens come down into the basement.  They come unarmed, so they are obviously not hunting people.  It would seed that since they launched a massive invasion a few days ago, that they would have had the place adequetely scoped out.  Come on now Stephen, you can do better than this.  ""War"" left me with a million questions about the invaders and only one real, definate answer.At the top of my list of gripes with this movie is the whiny, annoying performance of Dakota Fanning.  Her voice just goes straight through you.  By the middle of the film you will be praying for her to get killed just so she will shut up.  There is no one killer action sequence that doesn't involve the three main characters running away or hiding.  The 'climactic' action sequence isn't even that climactic, and I frankly was expecting much more. The aliens, which you would expect to be evil and menacing, are actually sorta cute when you see them.  There's no reasonable hint at the ending of the movie, which comes about suddenly and leaves those unfamiliar with the book asking 'that's it?'.  There is also no sense of time or distance as they travelling, and no real thought provoking message or point to the movie.  War of the Worlds failed miserably to connect with me as a viewer and did not suck me in when it had the chance.  'War' needs more than exploding houses, heat rays and flying cars to impress me.  If you want a more entertaining, deeper, and flat out better alien invasion flick, go rent Independence Day.The Final Word - A standard fare, big budget, summer blockbuster explosion fest with absolutely no depth to back up the hype.

From the very moment I walked into the theater, I was expecting to be scared out my seat by whatever the movie had in store.] The movie began with a nice slow pace with a disembodied narration by, --- I think --- Morgan Freeman with lines straight from the Novel. The film then then introduces you to the main character and less than perfect father, Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) a workman at a docking site who is given custody of his children; Robbie (Justin Chatwin and Rachel (Dakota Fanning) from his ex-wife (Miranda Otto!) for the weekend while she's out in Boston visiting her grandparents. Ray gets a less than welcome greeting from his children, who apparently hold some type of animosity toward him, especially his son Robbie. From there the movie slowly eases you into a state of calm before the storm. Watching Ray struggle to connect with his children was interesting and slightly funny (especially when he tried to talk to his daughter Rachel). However, as soon as ""bizarre Lightening storms"" are mentioned and everything electrical from cars to watches stop functioning, that's when the trouble really starts. I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen the movie, but I can say that the movie earned its ""Rated PG-13 for scary Sci-fi violence and disturbing images"" label.The moment the movie starts ""up & up"" in action and high tension as the martains commit horrendous things to the fleeing human beings with their HEAT RAYS (tight!), is when things get interesting. There is literally no sense of peace as you watch the movie, no moment of relaxsation or calmness. Tom Cruise was right to say ""Steven Spielberg will scare you like no other."" Ray scrambles to protect his rebelling children from all harm that comes their way, be it in the form of Humans or the invaders alike. Therefore let me say (much like others have probably done) I urge you not to let a younger child to see this movie, its that freaky. I practically had to keep myself still as I watched the horror and action unfold, the movie was frightening but the it was the coolest movie I've seen in a long time (2004 ""Spiderman II"" long). The acting the was amazing from everyone in this movie, although I did have a hard time getting used to Tom Cruise as a ragtag divorced father while feeling sympathetic for his problems as being a father to two unwilling children (who practically cut him down with exploits of their new father). He had played ""Blue Blood American"" in his films for so long, that is strange to see him play the bum father. It was a nice change to see for me: Tom Cruise playing the latter instead of a suave secret agent or busness man was quite refreshing. The music (John Williams again) really gives the already frightful atmosphere a more heightened feeling with an excellent score. Lastly the CGI is extremely well done in this movie, it looks and feels so realisic (much like SM-II did). The movie is COOL, there's not much I can say other than that. The plot that paraells from the very old movie (which made me laugh) and book itself, but if anything it stays ture to the novel with characters, scenes, and the invadors themselves. The drama as realistic and the action was non-stop for the most of the movie and even then you can't relax. There are some things to complain about in this movie, but that honestly like nippicking at small details better left unmentioned. On a last note the SINGLE DISC EDITION has only a featurette on the TRIPODS and ALIENS, so I would probably warrent buying the SPECIAL EDITION if your a speical features nut. ------[a 5 out of 5]",5,WAR OF THE WORLDS delievers on its promise and dazzles the senses,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,3695,"['[', 'My', 'Mother', 'sister', 'saw', 'War', 'Worlds', 'yesterday', 'Dad', 'Brother', 'went', 'see', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'very', 'moment', 'walked', 'theater', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'scared', 'out', 'seat', 'whatever', 'movie', 'had', 'store', ']', 'movie', 'began', 'nice', 'slow', 'pace', 'disembodied', 'narration', 'think', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'lines', 'straight', 'Novel', 'film', 'then', 'then', 'main', 'character', 'less', 'perfect', 'father', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'workman', 'docking', 'site', 'who', 'given', 'custody', 'children', 'Robbie', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'Rachel', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'ex-wife', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'weekend', 'out', 'Boston', 'visiting', 'grandparents', 'Ray', 'less', 'welcome', 'greeting', 'children', 'who', 'apparently', 'hold', 'type', 'animosity', 'especially', 'son', 'Robbie', 'movie', 'slowly', 'state', 'calm', 'storm', 'Watching', 'Ray', 'struggle', 'connect', 'children', 'was', 'interesting', 'slightly', 'funny', 'especially', 'when', 'tried', 'talk', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'However', 'as', 'soon', 'bizarre', 'Lightening', 'storms', 'are', 'mentioned', 'everything', 'electrical', 'cars', 'watches', 'stop', 'functioning', 'when', 'trouble', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'earned', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'scary', 'Sci-fi', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'images', 'label.The', 'moment', 'movie', 'action', 'high', 'tension', 'martains', 'commit', 'horrendous', 'things', 'fleeing', 'human', 'beings', 'HEAT', 'RAYS', 'tight', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'literally', 'sense', 'peace', 'watch', 'movie', 'moment', 'relaxsation', 'calmness', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'right', 'say', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'will', 'scare', 'other', 'Ray', 'scrambles', 'protect', 'rebelling', 'children', 'harm', 'way', 'be', 'form', 'Humans', 'invaders', 'alike', 'Therefore', 'let', 'say', 'much', 'others', 'have', 'probably', 'done', 'urge', 'not', 'let', 'younger', 'child', 'see', 'movie', 'freaky', 'practically', 'had', 'keep', 'still', 'watched', 'horror', 'action', 'unfold', 'movie', 'was', 'frightening', 'was', 'coolest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', '2004', 'Spiderman', 'II', 'long', 'acting', 'was', 'amazing', 'everyone', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'used', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'ragtag', 'divorced', 'father', 'feeling', 'sympathetic', 'problems', 'being', 'father', 'two', 'unwilling', 'children', 'who', 'practically', 'cut', 'down', 'exploits', 'new', 'father', 'had', 'played', 'Blue', 'Blood', 'American', 'films', 'so', 'long', 'strange', 'see', 'play', 'bum', 'father', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'see', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'playing', 'latter', 'instead', 'suave', 'secret', 'agent', 'busness', 'man', 'was', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'music', 'John', 'Williams', 'again', 'really', 'already', 'frightful', 'atmosphere', 'more', 'heightened', 'feeling', 'excellent', 'score', 'Lastly', 'CGI', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'feels', 'so', 'realisic', 'much', 'SM-II', 'did', 'movie', 'COOL', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'say', 'other', 'plot', 'very', 'old', 'movie', 'made', 'book', 'anything', 'ture', 'novel', 'characters', 'scenes', 'invadors', 'drama', 'realistic', 'action', 'was', 'non-stop', 'most', 'movie', 'even', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relax', 'are', 'things', 'complain', 'movie', 'honestly', 'nippicking', 'small', 'details', 'better', 'left', 'unmentioned', 'last', 'note', 'SINGLE', 'DISC', 'EDITION', 'only', 'featurette', 'TRIPODS', 'ALIENS', 'would', 'probably', 'warrent', 'buying', 'SPECIAL', 'EDITION', 'speical', 'features', 'nut', '[', '5', '5', ']']",N/A
635460,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00005JNTI,Ping Lim,"[1, 5]","What differentiates Steven Spielberg from other movie makers is his ability in telling a good story without going overboard with special effects.  Whilst Steven has all the best technology at his disposal, he didn't make this movie into a full blown shoot shoot and bang bang blockbuster such as Independence Day & Godzilla.  Those two offerings differ dramatically from this one as audience could feel that the story lines were built around the special effects.  If one really scrutinize Steven's movies, they all have one common theme: humanity.  Whilst I have never read Orson Welles' version before, suffice to say that there were elements in that movie that reminded me so much of scenes from Schlinder's List where humans were caged and they were to be exterminated.  When we think deeper of this issue, think not just of humans but of those caged animals that were to be brought to the factories to be slaughtered.  They were helpless and didn't have voices of their own to pledge for their own survival.  Anyway, that's another topic altogether.  This movie is slick with everything working cohesively.  Tim Robbins seemed to be over the top being a paranoid survivor, Dakota Fanning is at her usual professional and resourceful self, Miranda Otto has proven that she can mix with the top of the craft and Tom is being Tom (a professional).

No, I didn't read the book because books take too long to read and I've got better things to do with my time, like read magazine articles.Anyway, this film was nothing more than a darker version of ""Independence Day"" with even less of a plot.  I won't even go into all the plot holes (such as how they managed to avoid hypothermia after swiming in the Hudson in the middle of winter).  But I do question what exactly that stupid son was thinking when he wanted to help the military with the battle.  Yeah, they were going to just hand him a rock launcher and go, ""Shoot, kid!""Anyway, the whole movie revolves around Ray and his two kids (later on just one) running from the aliens admist all the chaos and panic of the stupid humans.  The aliens are relentless and remorseless and they capture and kill every human in their sight.  Unspurprisingly they look VERY similar to the aliens in ""Independence"" day.  The vehicles are different but they also also have the same shield thing where all of mankind's weapons are totally ineffective against them--just like in ""Independence Day"".  What was the deal with that red vine stuff anyway?  But it goes like this soon after the beginning (that's where they allow 99% of the character development) and keeps going that way until about 5 minutes to the end.  Then it ends abruptly with a short explanation of what happened.  I won't give it away but it was probably better in the book.The special effects are good.  The acting is fair.  Nothing blew me away.  I don't know why they didn't give Tom Cruise more lines.  His believability as someone scared the way he was was low.  The kids weren't too much better either, not even the little girl.  The plot could have been better.Overall, I might be giving this movie a too-generous review but I like Spieldberg.

Then prepare to embrace disappointment.When I heard that this film was being remade I was not happy. The original sources still hold up well after all these years and I don't think we should gratuitously remake films just so we can throw some cheesy CGI into them. So my expectations sank low...When I heard that Steven Spielberg was directing I was not happy. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has made some great films in his day, but his talent is waning and his good judgment flew out the window years ago when he decided to delete the guns from E.T. to make a political statement. Should a pacifist who decries the use of guns in a movie really be directing a film about a war (one that isn't a historical period piece, mind you)? So my expectations sank lower...When I heard that Tom Cruise was given the lead role in this film I was not happy. By paying out the equivalent of the GNP of a small nation to secure the antics of Hollywood's number one fruit-cake, the producers guaranteed that there would be no money left over for a script. They also guaranteed that the taint of Tom Cruise's insanity would mar the film and that Spielberg's fascination with Cruise's face would again lead to disturbingly close close-ups (see Minority Report). So my expectations sank to the lowest they have ever been.Then I saw the movie and was surprised to find that my expectations were still too high!Cruise is a divorced father of two, and spends the film trying to get his kids back to their  mother's house, while making a clumsy attempt at bonding with his son and comforting his daughter... Oh yeah! There has been an attack on earth by an alien race who are technologically superior to us, but don't worry; Spielberg didn't want to clutter up his family drama with trifles like combat or war so you never actually see any real fighting.Spielberg also decided that War of the Worlds (notice the word WAR) is a perfect place for another ham-fisted anti-gun message for the politically unenlightened who still think a .44 Magnum is more effective then hiding in a closet and soiling yourself. First Mr. Cruise picks up a gun and fires it to protect his family in their vehicle. Quickly coming to his senses he throws down the weapon, filled with disgust and self loathing that he could sink so low as to use such an evil device. Later our super-stud stumbles across Tim Robbins who is in possession of a gun and is not only willing to use it, but sees it as the only way to give him a chance to survive the aliens. But no one told Mr. Robbins that people with guns die first in Spielberg's world! So while our intrepid hero cowers in a closet (presumably in his own filth) we hear the horrible death that Mr. Robbins brings on himself by daring to brandish a firearm!Now in honor of Mr. Cruise's spat with the South Park T.V. show I give you school counselor Mr. Mackey: Guns are bad, M'kay. People who use guns are bad, M'kay. If you touch a gun you're bad, M'kay.Thank you for setting us all on the strait and narrow Mr. Spielberg, I'm sure that none of your viewers will ever try to defend themselves or their families again!The rest of the film consists of extreme close ups of Tom Cruise's face (when I say extreme close up I mean you can count the pores on the man's nose), Dakota Fanning screaming to the point where I was rooting for the aliens to kill her, more up close shots of Tom Cruise, lots of father son angst, even more up close and personal with Mr. Cruise's face, some flashing lights on the other side of a hill that MAY be a battle going on (or it could be an open air screening of Saturday Night Fever, we'll never know), and finally, more shots of the molecular structure of Tom Cruise's skin.Unless you just must see the DNA chains that make up Mr. Cruise's face, you would do better avoiding this film.",2,"Somewhere in this film there was, allegedly, a war taking

But those elements don't include characters acting in a way that is contrary to the way people normally act, unless there's a good reason for their bizarre actions.In War of the Worlds, the characters act in wildly unbelievable ways, making all of the film's special effects a waste.  If a weird lightening storm leaves a crater in the ground, it's believable that that a crowd will gather and gawk.  If the ground around the crater begins to shake, huge cracks appear, causing buildings to collapse, people will try to run away -- not retreat a few feet and continue to watch.  And if an enormous alien emerges and begins systematically vaporizing people, folks will try to run away, not scamper behind a car door and peer at the annihilation.  Yet that's exactly what Tom Cruise's character does!And why is it that these aliens have been watching Earth for a very long time -- long enough that the many machines they buried have had cities built on top of them -- and yet wait until now to invade?  Wouldn't it have been easier, say, five hundred years ago, when we had only very primitive weapons?  And if they're smart enough to develop these overwhelming technologies, aren't they smart enough to develop vaccines and antibiotics?I have raised two sons, through a divorce.  Teenage boys (and girls, I suppose) can be rebellious and impulsive.  But I've never met one who will, without any apparent reason, insist upon flinging himself into the fray, unarmed, against monstrous, extraordinarily powerful creatures that are destroying military forces like toys.  And what happens to this young man?  Is he vaporized?  Does he burst into flames and run screaming down the hill? No -- he promptly makes his way to his mother's house in a distant city, notwithstanding all of the mayhem, hostile mobs, lack of transportation, lack of food, etc. All off-screen, of course.Puh-leez.

635470,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B00005JNTI,Publius,"[3, 7]","The disappointing thing about Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" is that it could have been a lot more scarier if it only would have stuck closer to the original novel.  Do yourself a favor: read the original 1898 novel if you really want to be terrified.  Expect some good escapism in the film, but that's pretty much it.  I get the feeling that Dreamworks and Paramount rushed this movie out to the theaters to take advantage of the summer market, which turned out to very dreary for the industry.  The screenplay itself could have gone through a couple more revisions to clean up some obviously oversized plotholes.  The common flu, which eventually saves the day, could have been more present throughout the movie.  I imagine a scene where Ray (Tom Cruise) takes Rachel (Dakota Fanning) to the pediatricians office to get a flu shot.  This would establish Ray's reluctance to be a parent, and also establish the flu motif.  Spielberg probably struggled with Cruise as the `everyman', as did a large portion of the audience of this film.  Cruise is much more believable as a sports agent, a bartender, a slick hit man or a fighter pilot.  A divorced blue collar father of two is not Cruise's forte, nor is it what the audience expects of him.  Also, Dakota Fanning's role as a 11 year old going on 40 is getting tiring.  Popular culture has this obsession with kids being smarter then their parents, and Fanning's character in this movie is no exception.  Finally, whenever War of the Worlds is re-imagined or re-interpreted, its usually a product of its time.  The original Wells' book was a commentary on British imperialism, while the Orson Welles' broadcast scarred a nation on the brink of World War II.  The 1953 film was a reflection of general cold war paranoia. This film demonstrates the fear that we as a nation still feel in this post-September 11th world.  Overall, not one of Spielberg's best works nor is it one of the better adaptations of Wells' original vision.",3,Not one of Speilberg's Best,1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,1979,"['disappointing', 'thing', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'scarier', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'stuck', 'closer', 'original', 'novel', 'Do', 'favor', 'read', 'original', '1898', 'novel', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'terrified', 'Expect', 'good', 'escapism', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'feeling', 'Dreamworks', 'Paramount', 'rushed', 'movie', 'theaters', 'take', 'advantage', 'summer', 'market', 'turned', 'out', 'very', 'dreary', 'industry', 'screenplay', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'couple', 'more', 'revisions', 'clean', 'up', 'obviously', 'oversized', 'plotholes', 'common', 'flu', 'eventually', 'day', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'present', 'movie', 'imagine', 'scene', 'where', 'Ray', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Rachel', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'pediatricians', 'office', 'get', 'flu', 'shot', 'would', 'establish', 'Ray', 'reluctance', 'be', 'parent', 'also', 'establish', 'flu', 'motif', 'Spielberg', 'probably', 'struggled', 'Cruise', 'everyman', 'did', 'large', 'portion', 'audience', 'film', 'Cruise', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'sports', 'agent', 'bartender', 'slick', 'hit', 'man', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'divorced', 'blue', 'collar', 'father', 'two', 'not', 'Cruise', 'forte', 'what', 'audience', 'Also', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'role', '11', 'year', 'old', 'going', '40', 'getting', 'tiring', 'Popular', 'culture', 'obsession', 'kids', 'being', 'smarter', 'then', 'parents', 'Fanning', 'character', 'movie', 'exception', 'Finally', 'whenever', 'War', 'Worlds', 're-imagined', 're-interpreted', 'usually', 'product', 'time', 'original', 'Wells', 'book', 'was', 'commentary', 'British', 'imperialism', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'broadcast', 'scarred', 'nation', 'brink', 'World', 'War', 'II', '1953', 'film', 'was', 'reflection', 'general', 'cold', 'war', 'paranoia', 'film', 'fear', 'nation', 'still', 'feel', 'post-September', '11th', 'world', 'Overall', 'not', 'one', 'Spielberg', 'best', 'works', 'one', 'better', 'adaptations', 'Wells', 'original', 'vision']",N/A

Tons of battle sequences I think and more aliens vs man battles perhaps. So maybe that is why I only liked this film somewhat in the begining. This one I think needs to grow on you through more than one viewing. I've seen it about 7 times and like it each time a great deal more. Now I think it's a modern sci-fi masterpiece. Honestly there are few great directors left on this earth who can make truly astonishing blockbuster films. Steven Speilberg is one of the few left that can pull it off. James Cameron as well. But with Steven it seems the guy can't make a single film that is less than incredible. His track record speakes for it's self. Jaws, Close Encounters of The Third Kind, Saving Private Ryan, ET, three of the Indiana Jones films. Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, even Munich are all masterpieces of intelligent cinemamatic wonder. When it comes to Speilberg we've come to expect the best out of him, and in this film I think he delivers beautifully. While it's not his best effort, I still think this film is truly a sci-fi masterwork. When it comes to science fiction only two names come to mind that matter. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. It's that simple. Thank god we have them on this planet. In this film Tom Cruise gives a very believable performance, and one of a terrified parent that is just as scared as his kids are, and trying to find a way to get through what seems like an impossible situation, the extermination of the human race. While Justin Chatwin, who plays Robbie, the son in the family isn't all that great, Dakota Fanning is on the other hand simply brilliant. And of course there is so much action and suspense in this movie that it's nearly unbearable at times.

635473,A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY,B00005JNTI,Rabbi Yonassan Gershom,"[8, 11]","Amazingly, my small-town theater actually had this film on opening day.  Being a science fiction buff, I went to see it that same afternoon.  This is not E.T. or even Jurassic Park.  It's a much darker, heavier film (rated PG-13, but bordering on R in my opinion), with images reminiscent of 9/11.  Be prepared for action thrills, but also some disturbing scenes.Having read the book and seen two previous film versions, I knew the basic plot: Space aliens invade, seem invincible, conquer the Earth, but are done in by our bacteria (no immunity).  That part is predictable.  What Spielberg adds is a good human-interest story of how one family struggles to survive this invasion, and how they grow closer to each other in the process.  And of course, there are fantastic CGI effects.Roger Ebert didn't like the fact that the movie never really explains WHY the aliens invaded -- or does it?  True, there is no scientist standing up there in some war room, telling us the whys and wherefores.  But if you think about it, the reason is there: The aliens have returned to harvest their crop of humans.  The idea that this is a harvest is supported by the fact that, in this version at least, the tripods were already buried in the Earth.  Clearly, the aliens had been here before.  Did they seed the planet with life millennia ago, intending to come back when things had evolved to the point of usefulness?  If so, they didn't count on the fact that evolution would go its own way, making our world incompatible with the aliens' physiology (lucky for Earth!)Whatever their expectations upon arriving here, the aliens clear-cut the Earth with total ruthlessness, and leave nothing living behind.  At least, nothing living from our ecosystem.  The whole landscape is eventually taken over by their own crop of weird red plants.  I found myself thinking, this must be how the animals feel when humans come in and raze the forests to plant whatever, with total disregard for the existing ecosystem.  To the aliens, we are just animals.  And animals aren't told why the machines are cutting down the rainforest -- it just happens.  When we hear that deep horn-like sound before the tripods appear, we learn to fear it the same way that animals must fear the sound of a bulldozer.  (For all we know, that alien horn is simply the signal to begin another work shift.  An interesting touch, Mr. Spielberg.)There are also scenes of terrified humans in cages, waiting to be grabbed up into the tripod machines and made into fertilizer for those alien red plants.  I asked myself: Is this how cows feel, standing in line waiting to be slaughtered?  Or am I reading too much into this?

I loved the Cruise-Spielberg combination in ""Minority Report"" and I was hoping that this movie would be better than that. Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations.""War of the Worlds"" is the story about Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), an average guy, whose kids Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin) come to visit him one day. However, after they arrive, the weather becomes really bad and they find out that aliens are invading the Earth. The story mainly continues with these three people running around for survival.What's good about the movie:1) The acting: Tom Cruise, Tim Robbins and Justin Chatwin did a good job in acting their roles. But the main credit goes to Dakota Fanning, who acted flawlessly as Rachel.2) The special effects: Ok, so maybe the aliens in the end looked a little cheesy, similar to those from M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"", but the movie really looked realistic in some scenes (for example, when they are vaporizing the humans in the beginning of the movie).3) The direction: It is no news that Spielberg is an excellent director. From his previous works till today, he continues showing his talent even in this movie.What's bad about the movie:1) Weak Story: A major flaw in this movie is its weak storyline consisting of too many plot holes. People who have already read the book by H. G. Wells might understand the whole story, but for someone like me who doesn't know the story, and tries to understand it by watching the movie, it raises far too many questions such as:-> Which planet have these aliens come from and why are they studying us?-> Why do they suddenly start malfunctioning?-> How did they manage to bury those tripods underground, and why did they put it there long ago and leave Earth, only to arrive back this time?2) Weak Characterization: Tim Robbin's role is totally unnecessary in this movie! The storyline wouldn't have changed in any way whether he was there or not.Even though this movie doesn't contain much of a story, it is nevertheless a fast-paced, action-filled movie that would catch the audience's interest most of the time.

I did not expect to really like this film, as it would seem hard not to create something too gimmicky.  However, after seeing the movie, I can say that it is fairly entertaining: both visually/audibly arresting and prolific with reflective thought.  To me, to fully enjoy this movie, do not place all the burden of success or failure on the action, but let your mind and thinking bear some of the responsibility of making this enjoyable.  You will think of human nature under stress and not, surviving and coexisting with microorganisms, and what if an alien power (to some the Second Coming of Christ, Martians, Communists, whatever) comes to destroy us.Simply put, there was nothing that man could do to stop the aliens.  It was only the world of microorganisms that stopped the alien invaders, who did not have several millennia of evolutionary immunity against viruses and bacteria.  Moreover, human blood is full of microorganisms-some good and some very, very bad.Thus, thinking of sociology, fundamental science, and biological fact, it becomes easy to suspend disbelief and just go for the story as it is.  The greatest benefit of Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS is that it may provoke men into thinking more carefully of our natural habitat Earth and how we intend to live here.

635480,A2JYIDH7JIG48H,B00005JNTI,"R. Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[8, 15]","First the good news:  The movie is exciting and suspensful from start to finish.  What else would you expect when you put Steven Spielberg together with a pile of money?  So if that's all you care about (action entertainment with good effects), you needn't read further.Before proceeding to the bad news, I'm one of those people always whining about every other movie coming out being a remake of a better one, from Invasion of the Body Snatchers to D.O.A. to Flight of the Phoenix; from Father of the Bride to Cheaper by the Dozen to Mr. Deeds and so on.  I like Steve Martin, but he's no Spencer Tracy; Jerry Lewis is a good enough Nutty Professor; and certainly Adam Sandler, hilarious in some movies, is no Gary Cooper; and taking these roles seems arrogant, to me (I know a lot about arrogance), in each case.  Well, I could go on & on, but won't; you can just imagine me whining and griping and grumbling as I carry my popcorn into the theatre.  Tom Cruise is no Gene Barry.  OK, just kidding, maybe Tom Cruise is about as good as Barry (War of the Worlds, Atomic City, Burke's Law).  Anyway, I would have started out assuming this remake is a five star movie, then subtracting a star if it wasn't worth remaking.  I'd compare it to the previous movie, George Pal's 1953 version starring Barry, Ann Robinson, and Les Tremayne.  It was in technicolor and sci-fi fans remembered the spaceship design (magnetic tripods) fondly for decades.  The special effects won an Academy Award.  (Pal was like the Steven Spielberg of the 1950s, producing several quality sf movies amongst a plethora of low-budgeters.  His productions included Destination Moon, When Worlds Collide, Conquest of Space, and The Time Machine, all in technicolor, many with Oscar-winning special effects.) However, it turns out there are more important issues so:The scariest thing about this version of War of The Worlds is the notion that Tom Cruise is the only one smart enough to survive.  Scientology was started as a prank by L. Ron Hubbard to win a bet with a couple other sci-fi writers in the late 1940s.  Tom Cruise buys into it; his intelligence shows through in the character, Ray, he plays in the movie.  Fortunate enough to be the only person with everything needed to survive - the only running car, food, and a gun - Ray loses all these advantages in the first half of the movie.  Of course the writers are on his side and provide excuses and try to make Cruise look smart. But since the car is the same model I own, a Dodge Caravan with ugly fake woodgrain sides, but a very good car, I'll give back the one star I would have subtracted for the movie being another remake.The real problem some viewers will have is the ten minutes wasted on anti-gun propaganda, as out of place in the context of War of the Worlds as Adam Sandler in a Gary Cooper role, and a longer sequence apparently trying to advocate murder as a means to enforce pacifism.  In this part Tim Robbins is very good as an ambulance driver hiding in a cellar to fight the Martians from underground, but the whole sequence makes no sense and comes off as clumsy condescending hypocritical propaganda.  In one scene Cruise prevents Robbins from chopping the Martian tentacle with an axe, believing it's more important to keep hidden.  In another he prevents Robbins from shooting the Martians for the same reason.  Next when Robbins freaks out and starts tunneling out of the cellar, mumbling his plans to fight the Martians from the subways in the city, Cruise decides to silence him by murdering him, having his little daughter sing to cover the noise - that's the part that makes the least sense.  But immediately after the murder (offscreen, because it's a PC murder), Cruise chops the Martian tentacle with the same axe, and the girl runs out the door and Cruise follows to look for her, and shouts ""Make some noise!"" so he can find her.  Perhaps all this was meant to be disturbing; to me it was just insulting.  Anyway, in reality, the crazy Robbins would have murdered the stupid Cruise.  The whole episode is a twisted, far cry from anything that happened in the book - apparently Tim Robbins is a composite of characters:  the curate who the protagonist fought, knocked out, and left to the Martians, later rationalizing that it was not premeditated, and the artilleryman who was tunneling to the sewers of London, hoping to start an undeground resistance.  I would subtract 2 stars, one for the anti-gun part and another for this murder for pacifism hogwash, but Robbins is good in these scenes, so only one star, leaving 4.  And if you don't like Robbins, just watch Team America after War of the Worlds.At the start the narrator quotes Wells' description of how the Martians ""regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.""  Why Spielberg or his writers found it necessary to alter this idea with their inconsistent and preposterous addition that the Martians had placed their tripods underground on earth a million years ago, before the advent of intelligent humans, is as hard to imagine as why wealthy movie stars are continually taken in by scientology.  Maybe they should spend a fraction of that wealth on education.  Minus one star.So for all my grumpy criticism we're still at 3 stars, which means I recommend the movie for it's entertainment value, specifically for excitement and suspense from start to finish, with fun special effects, but don't expect any enlightenment.  If  Hollywood types want to hide propaganda messages in their entertaining movies, I suppose they have a right; but they don't need to ruin a classic to do it.  If you can enjoy an episode of Gilligan's Island, that makes about as much sense . . .",3,"Twisted, Hollywoodized, PC perversion of a timeless classic.",1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,5739,"['First',

Christian,"[1, 7]","War of the Worlds was pretty amazing.. filled with main characters and bit players who seemed to react realistically to the drama unfolding (unlike the over-rated ""Independence Day""). This was a nail-biter the whole way. Cruise, despite the negative press for his looney off-screen behavior, is actually wonderful in this role. The real stunner is little Dakota Fanning, who gives an all-out heartfelt performance as Rachel. She has an amazing future ahead of her!Unfortunately, the film lacks a solid storyline... it just wasn't there. Well-written, yes, but no real story. This movie just seemed to be more of a sequence of events, that while truly spectacular, wasn't ultiimately satisfying since much of the reason for the invasion and a clear resolution was never made clear. I think the movie ending seemed rushed and finalized far too quickly. Unlike the classic George Pal version, which brought on the demise of the ""Martians"" slowly and the viewer had to figure out what happened slowly. This movie featured an almost abrupt end to the creatures and left me to ask.. ""wait.. is that all there is?"" Still, there is MUCH to enjoy here...One note of superb cinematography among many moments is the conversation the father, son and daughter have in their van heading to a rural home. The camera close up of Cruise's distraught face, backing up.. going around the van looking at the conversation, trauma and drama of the characters as they try to make sense of what has happened, and zooming back in to finish on Cruise. The reflections of the passing countryside, people, spaceships, and weather swirling around the vehicle the whole time. That scene was absolute cinematic genius.The single DVD contains NO inner notes, which for any 20.00 multi-million dollar movie is unforgivable (c'mon Paramount!).... but the transfer is clean and sound is brilliant.

Wells wrote the novel over a century ago and Steven Spielberg has done a fantastic job of incorporating some of the literary tale's elements into his version: the tripods and their ear-shattering ""ULLA!"", the heat ray, the retaining baskets, the growth of the ""red weed,"" the demented ""Ogilvey"" (Tim Robbins), the devastating onslaught from the invaders, man's futile efforts to defend himself, and the final ""solution,"" among other parts familiar to fans of the book.The director also paid tribute to producer George Pal's 1953 Technicolor classic by using a similar ""probe"" into the basement occupied by Cruise and daughter Fanning, the destruction of a church, an American setting, and a brief appearance by the earlier film's stars: Gene Barry and Ann Robinson.There are many tense scenes, making this film not quite suitable for younger audiences.  The sound is loud and abrasive, befitting the on-screen destruction.  Surprisingly, John Williams's score is quite subtle and, on occasions, is barely audible.Actingwise, Cruise, contrary to his behavior off-screen, asserts himself well as the estranged father of two kids who must now do all that he can to save his children, as well as himself.  Fanning's strong performance shows why she is one of most popular child performers today. And Robbins is appropriately creepy as the man with the plan to bring down the invaders.While megahit ""Independence Day"" toured similar ground, ""War of the Worlds"" is more the work of a master storyteller and his name is Steven Spielberg.That alone makes it a film not to be missed!",4,Good homage to both Wells' novel and Pal's movie!,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,1580,"['H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'wrote', 'novel', 'century', 'ago', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'done', 'fantastic', 'job', 'incorporating', 'literary', 'tale', 'elements', 'version', 'tripods', 'ear-shattering', 'ULLA', 'heat', 'ray', 'retaining', 'baskets', 'growth', 'red', 'weed', 'demented', 'Ogilvey', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'devastating', 'onslaught', 'invaders', 'man', 'futile', 'efforts', 'defend', 'final', 'solution', 'other', 'parts', 'familiar', 'fans', 'book.The', 'director', 'also', 'paid', 'tribute', 'producer', 'George', 'Pal', '1953', 'Technicolor', 'classic', 'using', 'similar', 'probe', 'basement', 'occupied', 'Cruise', 'daughter', 'Fanning', 'destruction', 'church', 'American', 'setting', 'brief', 'appearance', 'earlier', 'film', 'stars', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'Ann', 'Robinson.There', 'are', 'many', 'tense', 'scenes', 'making', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'suitable', 'younger', 'audiences', 'sound', 'loud', 'abrasive', 'befitting', 'on-screen', 'destruction', 'Surprisingly', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'quite', 'subtle', 'occasions', 'barely', 'audible.Actingwise', 'Cruise', 'contrary', 'behavior', 'off-screen', 'well', 'estranged', 'father', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'must', 'now', 'do', 'can', 'save', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'Fanning', 'strong', 'performance', 'shows', 'why', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'child', 'performers', 'today', 'Robbins', 'appropriately', 'creepy', 'man', 'plan', 'bring', 'down', 'invaders.While', 'megahit', 'Independence', 'Day', 'toured', 'similar', 'ground', 'War', 'Worlds', 'more', 'work', 'master', 'storyteller', 'name', 'Steven', 'Spielberg.That', 'alone', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

635486,A2L7WYA5OENV03,B00005JNTI,Reticuli,"[1, 1]","The first half of this new War of the Worlds is an attempt to be completely realistic in taking a simple premise and carrying it through.  The people behave in a believable manner.  There's great suffering.  Spielberg once again is only able to do this by partly ripping off the accounts of alien abductees (see also Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, and the Taken miniseries).  The whole EMP initial prep attack has been widely claimed by a number of people.The coming out of the ground may or may not have come from Scientology, but that's really beside the point.  Even Robert Zubrin's Mars Direct Plan called for sending hardware to the Red Planet first to prepare for humanity's arrival.  I consider the comment about them sending these ""a million years ago"" to be a general arbitrary date thrown out there by Tim Robbin's character.  None of these people know for sure.  It's like saying a zillion years, which probably would have been a better line.  Lets say you discover the planet around 200 BC and do a survey with your small exploratory party.  900 years later the hardware arrives.  And then in the third trip the occupants show up.  Or you could make the trip times even longer with an even earlier discovery date, but if you're writing a story that takes into account a speed limit then it's not stupid and there would most definitely be cause for storing the war machines ahead of time.  Trying to explain why humanity never dug one up is a moot point since the technology is automatically of unknown sophistication and we don't even know how deep they were buried.  None of this damages the suspension of disbelief.Anyway, the acting, staging, direction, plotting and effects are all well done in that first half.  Roger Ebert made some very geeky comments against the tripod machines themselves saying he didn't like the way they looked and there should have been an even number of legs, an update to the Wells' outdated tripod concept.  Tripod-ness didn't bother me much, since the aliens are driving.  If there was an AI system on board you could have the robots bipedal, which is indeed far more mobile short of just flying around.  But if you've got an AI on board you'd have to assume the machines wouldn't need the aliens inside in the first place...especially if they can come all this way and mount a planetary scale invasion.  Without complex software to manage the balancing act (something our brains do for us) you're stuck with more than two legs if you go the legs route.  The aliens could simply have an aversion to AI.  Certainly Frank Herbert and James Cameron explored that subject enough to give one pause.The fertilizer concept didn't bother me, as well.  It was pretty obvious Spielberg and company were showing the blood and tissue being used as raw building blocks for the weed, which was being transformed (presumably through some form of viral gene therapy) into the red weeds that seemed to grow so quickly.  They probably weren't growing but reorganizing the cells into a form useful to the aliens.  That's why they were spreading so fast and were the same color.O.k., I've just eliminated some major complaints against this film, and yes, I also count the son amongst the believable characters.  Call me crazy, but the rules/psychology of Robby were established subtly and consistently enough to justify his later actions.  But didn't I say the movie was only 3 stars and 50% greatness?  Yes.  The film is on the one hand that attempt to be true to the premise, but the second half gets bogged down in manipulative Spielbergian tricks.  For instance the scene where Dakota Fanning is about to be taken away by a nice couple who thinks she's been abandoned.  There's this uncomfortably contrived dilemma that ought to make you cringe.  The first half treats us as intelligent adults, and beginning in this scene we're treated as idiots.  Not that the scene itself it stupid, rather everything progresses and follows naturally.  But it's so transparent as to what Spielberg is trying to make us feel.Then we have formula and clich&eacute;.  Tim Robbin's face singularly lit by a lantern like he's some serial killer.  There's a scene a few minutes later that's a combination of Jurassic Park and the Abyss with this robotic tentacle that's played out totally for the suspense of the thing but without much brains.  And I don't know about you, but after Saving Private Ryan, AI, and Minority Report, I'm about sick of this DP's use of bleach bypass...particularly after these last three films.  A lot of the lighting and angles look like they are direct copies from AI and Minority Report.  These dudes need to vary their look a little more.We also once again have too much Steven Spielberg for Spielberg's own good in the ending.  Now I know this is kind of how the book and the other movie ended, but this film just isn't leading in that direction.  This film -- in terms of where it was heading on its own, like a living, breathing creature -- wanted to go in one of two directions.  One was an ending with the camera further pulling back up and away behind Tom Cruise as he's yelling ""Rachael!, Rachael!""  That was one ending possibility.  The other opportunity to end it was after the fantasy dream...the last few moments of life before being sprayed all over the ground to be turned into those weeds.  His brain can't accept what's about to happen and has happened to the world, to his son & daughter, and concocts this fantasy to put his mind at ease in its last few moments.  Victims' brains are fully capable of doing this and this ""final fantasy"" has happened in situations where they've survived to tell about it.  Then as he closes his eyes, hugging his son after the alien hordes have died of the common cold, either we just see his red spray going out over the field, or we see the tube in him...something grotesque along those lines.  I think the spray would have been sufficient.And of course none of these scenarios would have had the ridiculous bookends with Morgan Freeman narrating.  For one thing, if the aliens are so good at turning Earth's animal cells into this red weed for terraforming the planet to their liking; it's totally absurd that they wouldn't be capable of combating disease.  But even more likely, since their DNA/RNA encoding scheme and cells would be different from Earth kinds it's unlikely they'd even be susceptible to becoming infected by our micro-organisms in the first place.  This is why Independence Day's computer virus story thread was such an ingenious update to the War of the Worlds.  If you're going to go that route, then I don't think you can beat that film.  The only problem is that one's a very humor-filled Hollywood blockbuster action flick.  But that's really the only way you can end up with a happy ending, with some camp along the way.  If you want to do it realistically, with seriousness and thoughtfulness, then you end up going where this film should have.  You can't have it both ways.",3,"50% Greatness, 40% Formula, 10% Cop-Out",1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,7004,"['first', 'half', 'new', 'War', 'Worlds', 'attempt', 'be', 'completely', 'realistic',

This Spielberg gets right.  Great science fiction or horror films, and this story straddles the line, say something general by showing something specific like any work of art.  Arent we all living lives that stripped to the core, are similar?  And if so, could the extraordinary happen in our world too?  Spielberg could show this once, in ET's generic suburban malaise, the mashed potatoes at dinner of Close Encounters.Then chaos breaks loose, and Spielberg is in his more recent element of effects and spectacle.  But WOTW is suprisingly good, until you remember that Spielberg started in horror, with Jaws at age 27.WOTW's strength is its constant homage to the original story, and other classic science fiction themes.  From the beginning 'scientific' voice over, showing paramecium in a drop of water, that fades into a view of earth from space...Spielberg is invoking classic horror and scifi themes.  This is the oldest theme of all, i.e., as we are to a bug under a microscope, oblivious and omnipotent, so too is something 'out there' to us.  The 'natural order to the world' theme is rampant.  Note how in an opening scene, the protagonist's child says her body will naturally kick out the splinter she gets when it is ready, and wont let her dad pry it loose.  Sound a little like the relationship between the earth and the aliens?The fact that the film is firmly ensconsced in scifi tradition, is also its weak point.  It is hard to generate suspense, when this same story has been told for 100 years.  Spielberg has a tough job, when everyone in the audience knows the ending, and is thinking of its possible variations.  Perhaps that the film is so true to the original is a strength, as it is hard to top.Last, the actors playing Cruise's kids, are particulary poorly cast, or directed.  Both are so annoying on screen, the pouty teen, the tyranical, screaming little girl...it is hard to root for them at all.  Cruise is hard to believe as a working class cad, since he is such an image of glamour.  Once the action starts, though, he is in his element.  It may be that Spielberg has lost his touch with directing actors who can play real characters.  When watching this family's plight, one is reminded of Close Encounters.  How important the mission of Dreyfuss or Terri Garr seemed to the audience, and how joyful their triumph.  Can you imagine watching ET and not caring either way if he goes home?This is no Close Encounters, but compared to the usual summer lackluster hits, this is a smart film.",4,"near return to form, by a once genre defining scifi director",1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,2642,"['movie', 'out', 'small', 'quiet', 'showning', 'everyday', 'people', 'everyday', 'lives', 'great', 'humor', 'tragedy', 'Spielberg', 'right', 'Great', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'films', 'story', 'line', 'say', 'something', 'general', 'showing', 'something', 'specific', 'work', 'art', 'Arent', 'living', 'lives', 'stripped', 'core', 'are', 'similar', 'so', 'could', 'extraordinary', 'happen', 'world', 'too', 'Spielberg', 'could', 'show', 'once', 'ET', 'generic', 'suburban', 'malaise', 'mashed', 'potatoes', 'dinner', 'Close', 'Encounters.Then', 'chaos', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Spielberg', 'more', 'recent', 'element', 'effects', 'spectacle', 'WOTW', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'remember', 'Spielberg', 'started', 'horror', 'Jaws', 'age', '27.WOTW', 'strength', 'constant', 'homage', 'original', 'story', 'other', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'themes', 'beginning', ""'scientific"", 'voice', 'showing', 'paramecium', 'drop', 'water', 'view', 'earth', 'space', 'Spielberg', 'invoking', 'classic', 'horror', 'scifi', 'themes', 'oldest', 'theme', 'i.e.', 'are', 'bug', 'microscope', 'oblivious', 'omnipotent', 'so', 'too', 'something', 'there', ""'natural"", 'order', 'world', 'theme', 'rampant', 'Note', 'how', 'opening', 'scene', 'protagonist', 'child', 'body', 'will', 'naturally', 'kick', 'out', 'splinter', 'when', 'ready', 'wont', 'let', 'dad', 'pry', 'loose', 'Sound', 'little', 'relationship', 'earth', 'aliens', 'fact', 'film', 'firmly', 'ensconsced', 'scifi', 'tradition', 'also', 'weak', 'point', 'hard', 'generate', 'suspense', 'when', 'same', 'story', 'been', 'told', '100', 'years', 'Spielberg', 'tough', 'job', 'when', 'everyone', 'audience', 'ending', 'thinking', 'possible', 'variations', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'so', 'true', 'original', 'strength', 'hard', 'top.Last', 'actors', 'playing', 'Cruise', 'kids', 'are', 'particulary', 'poorly', 'cast', 'directed', 'are', 'so', 'annoying', 'screen', 'pouty', 'teen', 'tyranical', 'screaming', 'little', 'girl', 'hard', 'root', 'Cruise', 'hard', 'believe', 'working', 'class', 'cad', 'such', 'image', 'glamour', 'action', 'though', 'element', 'may', 'be', 'Spielberg', 'lost', 'touch', 'directing', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'real', 'characters', 'When', 'watching', 'family', 'plight', 'one', 'reminded', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'How', 'important', 'mission', 'Dreyfuss', 'Terri', 'Garr', 'seemed', 'audience', 'how', 'joyful', 'triumph', 'Can', 'imagine', 'watching', 'ET', 'not', 'caring', 'way', 'home', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'compared', 'usual', 'summer', 'lackluster', 'hits', 'smart', 'film']",N/A
635488,A1AF8GGNQ6LTBK,B00005JNTI,Revelation Magazine,"[1, 3]","War of the Worlds is a terrifying and endlessly disturbing film because Stephen Spielberg treats his science fiction subject matter with the same seriousness that was necessary in any of his renowned historical accounts. Hints regarding the events of the Holocaust and September 11th certainly don't seem out of place here as, on an emotional level, this film has more in common with Schindler's List than it does with other alien invasion flicks. The extraterrestrial takeover--vividly depicted with undeniably brilliant visual effects--is never less than gut-wrenchingly horrific. At times the film is traumatic rather than entertaining. As an end of the world epic it is, for the most part, convincing and both the evil aliens and panicked human horde are appropriately appalling. Most effective of all is the way in which Spielberg expertly manipulates the attentions of his audience. Scenes of lurid horror are juxtaposed with scenes of creeping suspense, flickers of grief with moments of ominous awe. Screenwriters Josh Friedman and David Koepp discover inventive ways of incorporating a multitude of scenes and themes from H. G. Wells' novel, and Spielberg cleverly includes stylistic choices direct from the original Byron Haskin film. Ultimately, this version of War of the Worlds shares the strengths and weaknesses of its predecessors. Conveniences add up rather quickly in the final half-hour, however. Truly, it is only the strength and wisdom of Well's own philosophical words--conveyed to us by the stolid voice of narrator Morgan Freeman--that save us from Spielberg's sentimental take on the story's famously anti-climactic ending.--Brian A.

635493,AXOS8IWBXNZGT,B00005JNTI,"Richard W Little ""I am a maple leaf on the wi...","[2, 3]","Yesterday, I went out to see the cover version of War of the Worlds, starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, and directed by Steven Spielberg. I say ""cover version"" because the classic tale by H.G. Wells was previously made into a movie, back in the 1950s, and that movie won Academy Awards.So, how was the film? Well, DF screams an awful lot. She's young, so I don't expect to see the pinnacle of acting ability out of her, so I think the blame for the one-dimensional nature of her character falls more upon the script and the direction. E.T., which depended upon the acting of kids, did a much better job than this in this respect.TC? Well, he portrays an a--hole...someone who loves his kids, but doesn't look after himself well, or them either, and doesn't necessarily interact well with people in general. He does a good job with his role (unless, of course, you subscribe to the theory that this is how he actually is in real life, so it's not acting, and this theory has weight given his recent behavior). I'd say he does a good job with the material.Well, then, why didn't I think so much of this movie? Well, it's a deux ex machina script. It's been a long time since I read the book, or saw the original movie either, but I think this problem stems from the book, which was this way as well. Back when the book was written, germ theory was relatively new, and the use of it as a key part of the story made for a gripping tale. The movie has been set up to use that same ""salvation from Earth's bacteria"" motif, but without the underlying social commentary that gave the original story depth. So, like most deux ex machina scripts, this left me feeling that the movie was a little soul-less.The special effects do redeem the movie somewhat. They are exceptionally well done, and do an excellent job of conveying the feeling of being right in the middle of this horrifying war...once we get past the first attack sequence, in which it seems that TC is specifically targeted, and it's TC's special evasive manouvers which keep him alive. Let's face it, the aliens were going to be attacking indiscriminately, and not paying so much attention to targeting TC. Once we're past that initial sequence, though, it's smooth sailing.So, I have to lay the blame for this middling effort on Spielberg. This is one of his lower-grade efforts, not as bad as Twister or Close Encounters or Jurassic Park, but certainly not as good as Saving Private Ryan, E.T., Schindler's List, or even A.I.It is an entertaining popcorn movie, which you can take your older kids to see.

Where were the whining, annoying children in the original story? I guess H.G. Wells didn't know anything about marketing to the mall-shopping, mini-van crowd. Spielberg knows if you want the breeder, mall robots to buy tickets as a unit, everybody in the family has to be represented in the story. The only thing that kept me going through this disaster was the hope these little spoiled brats would be squashed by a Martian tripod. I haven't rooted this hard for the death of main characters in a movie since ""The Blair Witch Project."" This rates as the only version of this story that had me pulling for the invaders. Spielberg's made some great movies but too often he reverts to the insipid portrayal of the American nuclear family complete with annoying kids who are always smarter than their parents and constantly say things such as ""cool"" and ""awesome.""  Of course, the wife is also smarter than the bumbling, but loyal, husband. In the original, it was mankind that was primarily the focus of the alien threat. In the Spielberg formula, it must be the family that is under threat, because it is the family that buys movie tickets in bunches.

Kyle,"[7, 10]","This film had all the worst elements of a romance novel added to the worst elements of sci fi.Here goes:The alien tripods invade on the one weekend Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) gets custody of his car-stealing teenage son and his whiny brat daughter.  He's your typical weekend Dad, self-absorbed and barely capable of taking care of his two kids:  no clean sheets, no food, etc.Then, aliens attack.  This part of the film is pretty well-conceived.  Spielberg's usual amazing special effects do bring H.G. Wells' tripods to life.So, Cruise gathers up his kids and runs to Mama.  THey're headed to Boston in the only functional civilian vehicle to get the kids to their Mom.  Two thirds of this film is taken up with the little girl (Fanning) screaming and her older brother wanting to go off to join the Army and fight...Matter of fact, we have a perfectly lovely fight scene spoiled by Ferrier and Son's fight over whether he should join the Army.All this relational angst-a typical hallmark of romance. Cruise finally lets his son go his own way with the promise he'll rejoin the family in Boston.  He and his daughter go on---only to meet the one interesting character in the whole film---Tim Robbins plays an ambulance driver who's just about to go 'round the bend over the attacks---the 15-20 minutes Cruise and Fanning spend in his company is the only spine tingling part of the film.  The 'invasion' of Robbins' basement was amazing.  Best effects in the film by far as well!Cruise and family do reunite in Boston.  Then we have to suffer the worst non-ending of any science fiction film yet.",3,War of the Worst.....,1121385600,"07 15, 2005",2005,1595,"['film', 'had', 'worst', 'elements', 'romance', 'novel', 'added', 'worst', 'elements', 'sci', 'fi.Here', 'alien', 'tripods', 'invade', 'one', 'weekend', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'custody', 'car-stealing', 'teenage', 'son', 'whiny', 'brat', 'daughter', 'typical', 'weekend', 'Dad', 'self-absorbed', 'barely', 'capable', 'taking', 'care', 'two', 'kids', 'clean', 'sheets', 'food', 'etc.Then', 'attack', 'part', 'film', 'pretty', 'well-conceived', 'Spielberg', 'usual', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'bring', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'tripods', 'life.So', 'Cruise', 'up', 'kids', 'runs', 'Mama', 'THey', ""'re"", 'headed', 'Boston', 'only', 'functional', 'civilian', 'vehicle', 'get', 'kids', 'Mom', 'Two', 'thirds', 'film', 'taken', 'up', 'little', 'girl', 'Fanning', 'screaming', 'older', 'brother', 'wanting', 'go', 'off', 'join', 'Army', 'fight', 'Matter', 'fact', 'have', 'perfectly', 'lovely', 'fight', 'scene', 'spoiled', 'Ferrier', 'Son', 'fight', 'should', 'join', 'Army.All', 'relational', 'angst-a', 'typical', 'hallmark', 'romance', 'Cruise', 'finally', 'son', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'promise', ""'ll"", 'rejoin', 'family', 'Boston', 'daughter', 'go', '-only', 'meet', 'one', 'interesting', 'character', 'whole', 'film', '-Tim', 'Robbins', 'ambulance', 'driver', 'who', 'just', 'about', 'go', ""'round"", 'bend', 'attacks', '-the', '15-20', 'minutes', 'Cruise', 'Fanning', 'spend', 'company', 'only', 'spine', 'tingling', 'part', 'film', ""'invasion"", 'Robbins', 'basement', 'was', 'amazing', 'Best', 'effects', 'film', 'far', 'as', 'well', 'Cruise', 'family', 'do', 'reunite', 'Boston', 'Then', 'have', 'suffer', 'worst', 'non-ending', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'yet']",N/A
635497,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00005JNTI,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[2, 3]","Based on H. G. Well's novel and remaining suprisingly faithful to this source (with the exception of changing the time period, country and throwing in a couple of kids) Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" remake is undeniably a riveting movie experience. Fine acting, haunting music, chilling special effects and gritty, realistic directing makes you forget its faults and clench the arm rests of your chair instead.Ray Ferrier is a deadbeat dad, watching his kids for the weekend, whilst his pregnant ex-wife and her partner head to Boston. Despite the fact that 17 year old Robbie and 10 year old Rachel carry a hefty dose of resentment toward him, he tells his ex: ""don't worry about anything."" If there's one thing the movies have taught me, it's that saying that inevitably leads to disaster. Sure enough, a freak electric storm turns into something much worse and suddenly there are no phones, no cars, no watches and something rumbles under the streets. In the space of a few hours, the family is on the run from giant tripod devices that destroy any living thing within sight.Shown totally through the eyes of the three family members, the movie is less concerned with the aliens as it is with  the human beings, who are not attempting to fight aliens, but to simply survive them. Although there are several scenes of army forces on the move and one television news van, they remain on the edge of the action. As such our three protagonists have very little idea what's going on - and neither do we. Strictly told from Ray's point of view with no television or radio to tell us how the rest of the world's going, the movie has a frantic, almost claustrophobic atmosphere as the family races from destroyed city to deserted countryside to a basement inhabited by a deranged Tim Robbins (almost scarier than the aliens).The annoying publicity surrounding Katie Holmes has dented Cruise's likeability, but here he salvages his reputation as a legitimate movie star, playing the self-centred father who realises the costs and responsibilities of fatherhood that he's so long neglected. His best moments are silent ones, as whenever Rachel gets really scared, it's to her brother and not to her father that she runs - without words you can see how guilty he feels. The kids by the way are also good - though they do little apart from scream and run, they are realistic without being too annoying. In particular Dakota Fanning's hysteria is palatable...and catching. Though some have dismissed her performance as too needy and hysterical, I cannot imagine a ten-year old child behaving in any other way to such catastrophic events. Likewise Justin Chadwin's determination to fight is potent, and certainly relevant to contemporary situations.It is the three actor's frantic performances that are key to the movie's success as they detract attention from several gaping plot-holes (if the tripods have been underground all that time how come we never found them? If the aliens have been to earth millions of years ago, why didn't they just take the planet then?) as well as keeping the audience completely on edge.The 9/11 attacks and the dark side of human nature are at the forefront of the themes at work in the film. Near the beginning, the terror-stricken Rachel screams ""is it the terrorists?!"" and we are thankfully (though surprisingly) spared from any patriotism, soul-stirring speeches about how everyone has to work together, or Tom Cruise beating the aliens with his bare hands. Rather, the events that take place rather grimly portray how we as human beings probably would react in such a situation - for example the selfish and pointless skirmish that arises over a car and the petty arguments that go on within the family despite the catastrophe happening around them.Ultimately, the film does not go quite as deeply into these ideas than it could and Spielberg can't resist one of his trademark endings, but he more than compensates with all the suspense, horror, deaths, panic-stricken mobs and scenes of unflinching doomsday action that you could possibly wish for. Rest assured, this isn't a thinking movie and it isn't one of Spielberg's best - but as an unsettling, nerve wracking adrenaline rush, nothing does it better than this.",4,"""Get in the Car or You're Gonna Die!""",1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,4256,"['Based', 'H.', 'G.', 'Well', 'novel', 'remaining', 'suprisingly', 'faithful', 'source', 'exception', 'changing', 'time', 'period', 'country', 'throwing', 'couple', 'kids', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'remake', 'undeniably', 'riveting', 'movie', 'experience', 'Fine', 'acting', 'haunting', 'music', 'chilling', 'special', 'effects', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'directing', 'forget', 'faults', 'clench', 'arm', 'rests', 'chair', 'instead.Ray', 'Ferrier', 'deadbeat', 'dad', 'watching', 'kids', 'weekend', 'whilst', 'pregnant', 'ex-wife', 'partner', 'head', 'Boston', 'fact', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Robbie', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Rachel', 'carry', 'hefty', 'dose', 'resentment', 'ex', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'anything', 'one', 'thing', 'movies', 'have', 'taught', 'saying', 'inevitably', 'disaster', 'Sure', 'enough', 'freak', 'electric', 'storm', 'something', 'much', 'worse', 'suddenly', 'are', 'phones', 'cars', 'watches', 'something', 'rumbles', 'streets', 'space', 'few', 'hours', 'family', 'run', 'giant', 'tripod', 'devices', 'destroy', 'living', 'thing', 'sight.Shown', 'totally', 'eyes', 'three', 'family', 'members', 'movie', 'less', 'concerned', 'aliens', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'attempting', 'fight', 'aliens', 'simply', 'survive', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'army', 'forces', 'move', 'one', 'television', 'news', 'van', 'remain', 'edge', 'action', 'such', 'three', 'protagonists', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'neither', 'do', 'Strictly', 'told', 'Ray', 'point', 'view', 'television', 'radio', 'tell', 'how', 'rest', 'world', 'going', 'movie', 'frantic', 'almost', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'family', 'races', 'destroyed', 'city', 'deserted', 'countryside', 'basement', 'inhabited', 'deranged', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'almost', 'scarier', 'aliens', '.The', 'annoying', 'publicity', 'surrounding', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'dented', 'Cruise', 'likeability', 'here', 'reputation', 'legitimate', 'movie', 'star', 'playing', 'self-centred', 'father', 'who', 'costs', 'responsibilities', 'fatherhood', 'so', 'long', 'neglected', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'silent', 'ones', 'whenever', 'Rachel', 'really', 'scared', 'brother', 'not', 'father', 'words', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'guilty', 'kids', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'do', 'little', 'apart', 'scream', 'run', 'are', 'realistic', 'being', 'too', 'annoying', 'particular', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'hysteria', 'palatable', 'catching', 'have', 'dismissed', 'performance', 'too', 'needy', 'hysterical', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'ten-year', 'old', 'child', 'behaving', 'other', 'way', 'such', 'catastrophic', 'events', 'Likewise', 'Justin', 'Chadwin', 'determination', 'fight', 'potent', 'certainly', 'relevant', 'contemporary', 'situations.It', 'three', 'actor', 'frantic', 'performances', 'are', 'key', 'movie', 'success', 'detract', 'attention', 'several', 'gaping', 'plot-holes', 'tripods', 'have', 'been', 'underground', 'time', 'how', 'come', 'never', 'found', 'aliens', 'have', 'been', 'earth', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'planet', 'then', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'audience', 'completely', 'edge.The', '9/11', 'attacks', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'are', 'forefront', 'themes', 'work', 'film', 'beginning', 'terror-stricken', 'Rachel', 'screams', 'terrorists', 'are', 'thankfully', 'surprisingly', 'spared', 'patriotism', 'soul-stirring', 'speeches', 'how', 'everyone', 'work', 'together', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'beating', 'aliens', 'bare', 'hands', 'Rather', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'rather', 'grimly', 'portray', 'how', 'human', 'beings', 'probably', 'would', 'react', 'such', 'situation', 'example', 'selfish', 'pointless', 'skirmish', 'car', 'petty', 'arguments', 'go', 'family', 'catastrophe', 'happening', 'around', 'them.Ultimately', 'film', 'not', 'go', 'quite', 'as', 'deeply', 'ideas', 'could', 'Spielberg', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'one', 'trademark', 'endings', 'more', 'compensates', 'suspense', 'horror', 'deaths', 'panic-stricken', 'mobs', 'scenes', 'unflinching', 'doomsday', 'action', 'could', 'possibly', 'wish', 'Rest', 'assured', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'movie', ""n't"", 'one', 'Spielberg', 'best', 'unsettling', 'nerve', 'wracking', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'nothing', 'better']",N/A

A pale green overcast to the film, a general sense of staleness.  The plot was so poorly developed that what really stood out in the first half of the movie was how stupid kids can be, not listening to adults when danger is present, and blowing it with childish screams at exactly the wrong moment.  Perhaps this is Hollywood ""fast food"" and intended to be dramatic.This comment may strike many as off-topic, but if you glance over my other 600 reviews (almost all of non-fiction about global issues), you might see the logic.  Toward the end of the movie, with a bow toward Huntingon's ""Clash of Civilization,"" I saw the ""aliens"" as the U.S. and the humans as ""everyone else.""  The aliens crashed through, sucked blood (oil), destroyed everything in their path.  In the end, they were undone by a suicidal terrorist (Tom Cruise) who was willing to go into the bowels of the beast to explode grenades, but was saved by a uniformed pal so we could have a happy ending.I do not know if H.G. Well intended this (his book, ""The World Brain"" is one of the most important books anyone could ready right now as we prepare to create that World Brain and empower people), but all the reading I am doing is putting forward multiple world wars: between humans and bacteria; between individuals and corporations; between reality-based policy and zealot faith-based policy; between radicalized Islam and radicalized Judiaism that has merged with extremist evangelical Christianity.At the end, I gave the movie four stars instead of three because it did cause me to think and reflect on the modern implications of man versus machine.",4,"Gripping for Children, Annoying for Adults",1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,1698,"['ten-year', 'old', 'loved', 'movie', 'found', 'gripping', 'found', 'annoying', 'pale', 'green', 'overcast', 'film', 'general', 'sense', 'staleness', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'developed', 'what', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'stupid', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'listening', 'adults', 'when', 'danger', 'present', 'blowing', 'childish', 'screams', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'moment', 'Perhaps', 'Hollywood', 'fast', 'food', 'intended', 'be', 'dramatic.This', 'comment', 'may', 'strike', 'many', 'off-topic', 'glance', 'other', '600', 'reviews', 'almost', 'non-fiction', 'global', 'issues', 'might', 'see', 'logic', 'end', 'movie', 'bow', 'Huntingon', 'Clash', 'Civilization', 'saw', 'aliens', 'U.S.', 'humans', 'everyone', 'else', 'aliens', 'crashed', 'sucked', 'blood', 'oil', 'destroyed', 'everything', 'path', 'end', 'were', 'undone', 'suicidal', 'terrorist', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'bowels', 'beast', 'explode', 'grenades', 'was', 'saved', 'uniformed', 'pal', 'could', 'have', 'happy', 'ending.I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'H.G', 'Well', 'intended', 'book', 'World', 'Brain', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'books', 'anyone', 'could', 'ready', 'right', 'now', 'prepare', 'create', 'World', 'Brain', 'empower', 'people', 'reading', 'am', 'doing', 'putting', 'forward', 'multiple', 'world', 'wars', 'humans', 'bacteria', 'individuals', 'corporations', 'reality-based', 'policy', 'zealot', 'faith-based', 'policy', 'radicalized', 'Islam', 'radicalized', 'Judiaism', 'merged', 'extremist', 'evangelical', 'Christianity.At', 'end', 'gave', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'three', 'did', 'cause', 'think', 'reflect', 'modern', 'implications', 'man', 'versus', 'machine']",N/A

To be honest, I saw little point in remaking such a perfect film (definitely 5 stars), so I balked at getting this one until the price was so low I could own rather than rent it for nearly the same price.When we played it, I was very happy with the new adaptation.  Cruise is really good as a flawed, struggling divorcee:  he can scarcely cope with real life as it is, and suddenly he is confronted with a truly terrifying menace.  His children are also excellent actors, in particular the rebellious son who goes his own way and uncannily resembles Cruise.  There is also Tim Robbins, whose defiant ranting is such a convincing counter-poise to  the cautious Cruise as survivor.Of course, the special effects are simply spectacular, and as in so many contemporary films almost a distraction from the plot.  I particularly liked the aliens' attempt to re-make the ecology of Earth in their grizzly manner.Warmly recommended.  This is a better than average remake that sticks to the book's original themes and the acting is outstanding.

Wells wrote the story, I doubted he believed critics of his time would hail it as Shakespeare. They probably didn't. But Spielberg's version does exactly what a summer blockbuster is supposed to do - ENTERTAIN. Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning are first rate. John Williams' score is perfectly dramatic. But it is the alien tripods and the other special effects that truly blow you out of your seat. I have read some reviews that say that Spielberg's movie is trash. On the contrary, the film fills the audience with dread and thrills and horror and most important of all, it reminds us of how small we really are in comparison to, no, not to aliens from another planet, but to our own temptation to kill each other, if not by nuclear war then in some other way. Mankind has never learned how to deal with his inherited free will. God gave us ALL the ability to think for ourselves. And it has been proven that we can make some good decisions because we are basically good people. But most of the time we end up shooting ourselves in the foot. Mankind has not, and probably never will learn his lesson, and that's too bad. While watching people being destroyed by these gargantuan alien tripods in Spielberg's thriller, I was reminded of mankind's constant failure to learn from his mistakes. It is very, very sad because we will never change (since recorded history we have not changed so why believe otherwise, and I'm an optimist). Spielberg's flawed masterwork (yes, it has some flaws, but what film doesn't) shows how puny we really are, how vulnerable we remain. This is not some empty-headed summer blockbuster that Americans are used to ('Mr. and Mrs. Smith', 'The Fantastic Four', 'Godzilla', 'Independence Day', and even 'Jurassic Park'). 'War of the Worlds' makes us think about ourselves. Abraham Lincoln said that if America came to an end, it would be by suicide and not by some foreign invader. 'War of the Worlds', and I'm not just speaking of Spielberg's excellent film, but also about Wells' storytelling, is a thinking person's tale of a possible tragic ending to the human race as we know it. And let me put it another way. As members of the human race we can be sure we don't need to wait for an attack from aliens from far out into space because there are plenty of reasons to believe there are people here on our perfect planet who want nothing better than to destroy civilization as we know it. And the scary thing is, they are capable.

635503,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B00005JNTI,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[5, 14]","Back in my grad school days, when I was determined to soak up as much culture as possible, I found myself at a small party in Cambridge where a discussion was taking place between three budding actresses and a professor of classic literature.  The three young women were starring in a new interpretation of a well-known play, the twists being a bare stage and equally bare actors and actresses.  Intended to be a metaphor, the stark stage and nudity were upsetting to the professor, who labeled them both tacky artifice that cheapened the story and message of the play. The actresses (not to a small degree impressed with their own daring for appearing for over an hour on stage in the nude) were arguing that nudity in film and stage was honest, and indeed focused the audience's attention upon the emotions and struggle of a story.Apparently being the only one at the gathering willing to admit that I had ever seen a porn movie, I sided with the professor and stated that graphic nudity, like porn which takes this concept to its extreme, was numbing to the senses and, if not offered in extreme moderation, leaves the audience too dazed to care about the story.I thought of this conversation last night while watching Steven Speilberg's War of the Worlds.Unlike the book and unlike the 1953 original Hollywood treatment of this classic, the Speilberg version barely attempts to set the events we witness in any larger context.  The approach is closer to Orson Wells' famous radio version which, since it posed as a live news report from New Jersey (also the initial setting for Speilberg's version) effectively focused exclusively on events there.  In Speilberg's version we see the action entirely through the eyes of Tom Cruise's main character.  The terrifying mayhem to which he is unexpectedly exposed, his personal efforts to save his immediate family, and his understandable fixation upon them and them alone, narrow the focus of this film tremendously.  But they also take away from the larger story from which the movie stems.  As presented, Cruise could be trying to save his son and daughter from a wildfire, from an earthquake, a plague, or a hoard of invading vacuum cleaner salesmen.  There is nothing at all distinguishing about his quest, removed as it is from what should be the larger story.In place of that larger story, Speilberg has chosen to overwhelm the audience's senses with special effects depicting the mindless destruction of the alien invaders.  Unfortunately, just like sitting through a 90 minute porn movie where 80 minutes nothing but depict raw sex, the effect is at first titillating and exciting, but quickly becomes simply boring.  Watching Speilberg's invading CGI tripods vaporize yet another random set of hapless refugees is, by the third time we see it, no more interesting than watching an equally artificial California porn actress bend over and start moaning for the tenth time in a row.Perhaps more to the point, as screenwriting guru Robert McKee points out, it is the protagonist's struggle which makes any story ultimately interesting.  From a narrative perspective, this is one of the biggest problems with porn: there IS no struggle...we go immediately from Hello to nookie; but while McKee is unquestionably correct, for audiences to be engaged, that struggle also has to MEAN something; otherwise we might as well be watching Sisyphus pushing his rock endlessly and repeatedly up a hill.  This is another major failure of Speilberg's movie.  Except for his membership in the human race (and his instinctive protective feelings for his kids), there is nothing to make Cruise's struggle significant.  He is depicted as a divorced, absent father, with a smart-mouthed rebellious teenaged son and a Hollywood-sweet daughter.  His former in-laws have no use for him and his ex-wife has moved on to a better and more appropriate situation.  That is all we know, and we hardly even know that.  So who cares?  In then end, when Cruise predictably triumphs, all he has accomplished is the delivery of his daughter to the waiting arms of her mother on an oddly unscathed Beacon Street.  The briefest of nods from his former father-in-law and an awkward hug from his son offer only the barest hints of larger gains achieved, and, as fans of the story know, the Cruise cannot take even the slightest credit for the invaders' ultimate demise.The inescapable impression is that this movie, much like any porn flick, was build not upon a compelling story, but rather razzle-dazzle, ooohs and ahs, and spectacle.  The focus may have been on aliens and their machines rather than T&A;, but in the end the effect was the same.  The audience could have come in after the first twenty minutes, left after the first on-screen thrill, and not missed a thing.  Given this result, it is a shame that Mr. Spielberg put as much effort as he did into this movie; a porn flick would have been a lot cheaper and a lot quicker to make.",3,Si Fi Porn,1135382400,"12 24,

Humanity is being exterminated by powerful aliens, it's hopeless, and there's little to do but run.

But imagine if they had done more besides that, and had given us awesome shots of overall distruction, with tripods laying waste to all areas of the planet.  Now that would have been a sci-fi fanboy's wet dream.  But No!  Instead, Steven S. throws in all the corny schmaltz that he is famous for, thereby diluting the whole thing.  So what we get is, while the war is going on in the background, we have the father and son arguing in the foreground.  Corny!The whole basement scene just doesn't hold up to repeat viewings, and I definitely skip to the next chapter on that one.  The basement scene, however, does give us the chance to see the alien tentacle and the aliens themselves, but the film seems to hit a speedbump in the basement and the film just slows to a crawl.And of course, we have the happy ending tacked on at the end, which seems completely out of place with the rest of the movie.  Spoiler question: If the son ran into the battle and the whole place erupted into flames distroying the Army, just how the heck did he show up at the end?  Pretty dumb, and lame too.  Besides, that darn kid is so annoying - I wish one of the tripods had picked him up and made blood fertilizer out of him.And speaking of annoying, that darn Dakota Fanning just screams throughout the whole darn movie, and just gives you a headache.  There is nothing more annoying than a screaming child.  Man, I wish a tripod had gotten ahold of her as well, just so she would finally shut the heck up.People generally agree that the ending is anti-climactic, but I do have to point out that we get not one, but two climaxes before that ending:  when Ray single-handedly brings down a tripod, and again when the Army does the same.  Still, if the movie had guts, the teenage boy would have been toast at the end.Everyone has already pointed out the working camcorder in the beginning.  But here's another one:  Why did the tripod put a guy on the ground to stick their alien needle into him, when they could have done the same in their basket directly under the tripod?  I guess the tripod just wanted to give Steven S. a Kodak moment.  And of course, we can see the blood travelling up the tentacle.  Can anyone say Gratuitous Shocking moment?But though it all, I still like this film.  And what a juxtaposition to 9/11.  If you watch this movie, then go to YouTube and watch videos of the real 9/11, you will see where S.S. completely lifted moments from that national tragedy.I'm no Cruise fan, but I like him here.  He's better playing a jerk, maybe because it's not such a stretch for him.And nice to see the stars of the original WOTW in a quick shot as the in-laws at the end.I don't love it, but man, I sure do seem to enjoy sticking it in my dvd player every now and then and watching parts of it with the volume at full.",4,"Too little ""War"", Too much Real ""World"".",1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,2950,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'love', 'movie', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'awesome.The', 'whole', 'story', 'told', 'Cruise', 'viewpoint', 'imagine', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'besides', 'had', 'given', 'awesome', 'shots', 'overall', 'distruction', 'tripods', 'laying', 'waste', 'areas', 'planet', 'Now', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sci-fi', 'fanboy', 'wet', 'dream', 'Instead', 'Steven', 'S.', 'corny', 'schmaltz', 'famous', 'thereby', 'diluting', 'whole', 'thing', 'So', 'what', 'get', 'war', 'going', 'background', 'have', 'father', 'son', 'arguing', 'foreground', 'Corny', 'whole', 'basement', 'scene', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'definitely', 'skip', 'next', 'chapter', 'one', 'basement', 'scene', 'however', 'give', 'chance', 'see', 'alien', 'tentacle', 'aliens', 'film', 'hit', 'speedbump', 'basement', 'film', 'just', 'crawl.And', 'course', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'tacked', 'end', 'completely', 'place', 'rest', 'movie', 'Spoiler', 'question', 'son', 'ran', 'battle', 'whole', 'place', 'erupted', 'flames', 'distroying', 'Army', 'just', 'how', 'heck', 'did', 'show', 'up', 'end', 'Pretty', 'dumb', 'lame', 'too', 'Besides', 'darn', 'kid', 'so', 'annoying', 'wish', 'one', 'tripods', 'had', 'picked', 'up', 'made', 'blood', 'fertilizer', 'him.And', 'speaking', 'annoying', 'darn', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'just', 'whole', 'darn', 'movie', 'just', 'headache', 'nothing', 'more', 'annoying', 'screaming', 'child', 'Man', 'wish', 'tripod', 'had', 'gotten', 'ahold', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'would', 'finally', 'shut', 'heck', 'up.People', 'generally', 'agree', 'ending', 'anti-climactic', 'do', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'get', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'climaxes', 'ending', 'when', 'Ray', 'single-handedly', 'down', 'tripod', 'again', 'when', 'Army', 'same', 'Still', 'movie', 'had', 'guts', 'teenage', 'boy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'toast', 'end.Everyone', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'working', 'camcorder', 'beginning', 'here', 'one', 'Why', 'did', 'tripod', 'put', 'guy', 'ground', 'stick', 'alien', 'needle', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'basket', 'directly', 'tripod', 'guess', 'tripod', 'just', 'wanted', 'give', 'Steven', 'S.', 'Kodak', 'moment', 'course', 'can', 'see', 'blood', 'travelling', 'up', 'tentacle', 'Can', 'anyone', 'say', 'Gratuitous', 'Shocking', 'moment', 'still', 'film', 'what', 'juxtaposition', '9/11', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'go', 'YouTube', 'watch', 'videos', 'real', '9/11', 'will', 'see', 'where', 'S.S.', 'completely', 'lifted', 'moments', 'national', 'tragedy.I', ""'m"", 'Cruise', 'fan', 'like', 'here', 'better', 'playing', 'jerk', 'maybe', 'not', 'such', 'stretch', 'him.And', 'nice', 'see', 'stars', 'original', 'WOTW', 'quick', 'shot', 'in-laws', 'end.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'man', 'sure', 'do', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'sticking', 'dvd', 'player', 'now', 'then', 'watching', 'parts', 'volume', 'full']",N/A

Tom Cruise I considered one of the best actors to ever hit the screen, for I never hated one of his movies, even if the plot wasn't for me, I still just enjoyed how well he played his roles. Who knew eventually he would disappoint? And he did, this Tom Cruise that played in this movie was lousy- dull and wooden was Tom in this film. The other actors were not much better either. Yet the main blame of the poor acting rests entirely, unfortunately, on Tom. He was the main person in this film and he did not uphold it like he did in his older films and that was one of the reasons this film is low in rating for me. Tom Cruise has spent so much of his time in Scientology that he has lost focus and strength in his very own career. I don't know maybe Tom Cruise has an ego now that thinks he can play anything and make it look good- uh no Tom, think again. I'm a major fan and even I know your performance was poor.Also another major problem was that nothing was explained. You were supposed to just know so many things in this movie. I assume they thought it would be all right as long as they could dazzle us for a few minutes with big machines and a few shots of aliens. No. I wanted explanations of these aliens, why they were there in the first place and why all of a sudden did they lose as fast as they were winning? Sorry for the spoiler but I'm trying to make a point. Now a few other people give explanations but the point is where were explanations in the movie? I don't care if the older film gave the answers, a lot of us did not watch the older version and expected the same answers as the old one did. If Tom assumed we all had watched the older version and didn't need time for an explanation he was once again wrong. I assumed it was the blood they took from a few of the humans but still did we get a clear explanation-no.My friend and I were baffled at the end, already half bored and half interested as we were throughout the whole film, how quickly the ending was cut and how ridiculous it was in general. It was like they made a Disney like happy ending- in an alien film? Oh no Tom, oh no. Lame at best. This whole movie had me wondering about Tom Cruise's future, and I think it might actually go downhill till he is a Hollywood recluse. I really hope not, but I can't help but be upset with him at such a lousy film that could have been done so much better. Get your head out of the Scientology clouds Tom, and get your eyes for once off of your fiance, and start working back to becoming the great actor you once were- for right now you are slipping in my book. And as for the kids- keep up the acting lessons for you were not that belivable yourselves.Bad acting, lame ending, large gaps in the plot you cannot recover, good action scenes- what little you had of them, boring drama not even believable. Overhyped, and overrated just because of a big name in the film. This proves you cannot always trust that a big name will save a film. I know this now.

635511,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNTI,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 5]","With his stunning remake of H. G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds,"" Steven Spielberg has created one of the most intense and terrifying visions of the coming apocalypse in motion picture history.  Here is a film that makes ""Independence Day"" look like a Sunday school picnic or a casual stroll through Central Park on a warm sunny afternoon.  The utter darkness of this film is rather amazing considering the fact that Spielberg practically cut his teeth as a director on benign (albeit brilliant) sci-fi fantasies like ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T,"" movies in which visitors from outer space were seen as emissaries of peace rather than invaders bent on destroying the human race (I don`t think it`s merely a coincidence that the unnerving sound the alien machines make in this film resembles some of the notes from Bernard Herrmann`s score for ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"").  In ""War of the Worlds,"" the aliens are anything but benign; they are cruel, vicious, bloodthirsty and unstoppable, creatures more akin to the ones in ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park"" than those in ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T.""  And, indeed, there are far more echoes of scenes from ""Jurassic Park"" in ""War of the Worlds"" than any other previous Spielberg work.  ""War of the Worlds"" is certainly a case of Spielberg returning to his more ""primitive"" roots, for after his recent ventures into the world of cerebral sci-fi (""A.I."" and ""Minority Report""), the director pulls out all the stops in this film, turning out a full-throttle, no-holds-barred orgy of non-stop death and destruction.  In ""War of the Worlds,"" Spielberg has found the perfect source material for his roller coaster ride mentality and it pays off beautifully for all concerned.  As always, Spielberg turns a mere ""genre"" picture into a work of art.Tom Cruise stars as Ray Ferrier, a working class stiff living in northern New Jersey who seems barely able to take care of himself, let alone the teenaged son and eleven-year-old daughter who have come to stay with him while their mother is away in Boston visiting her parents.  Ray is obviously anything but a model parent, having alienated both children, particularly his son, with his absentee parenting style and casual indifference to the lives they are leading.  All that is about to change, however, when, without any real warning, the earth suffers a massive invasion by creatures from outer space whose killer machines have been lying dormant underground for seemingly millions of years.  As the monsters wreak havoc upon the planet, Ray flees with his children, searching for a place of safety in a world suddenly turned upside down and apparently headed for extinction and annihilation.Spielberg has wisely chosen to paint Ray in less than heroic terms.  In addition to the fact that he has trouble assuming the role of protector and comforter for his own children, he is often at a loss as to what to do to escape the threat and ensure their survival.  The director has Cruise work against type here, helping us to identify with his plight in a way we might not have were he conceived as a more conventional heroic type.  Although it's a little hard to accept Cruise as such an uncaring father, we go along with the premise, knowing that he will eventually become closer to his kids though the life-threatening situation in which they find themselves.As this is a Spielberg film, it goes without saying that ""War of the Worlds"" is a model of state-of-the-art visual and sound effects, and that the director exploits every moment for its full intensity and impact.  This is as tightly-wound and suspenseful a thriller as I have seen in years.  But what really puts it over is the way in which Spielberg manages to bring an end-of-the-world eeriness and paranoia to so much of the film.  The first half, in particular, is almost unbearable to watch, so unsettling is the sense of inexplicable dread and doom that hangs over the work, so intense our feeling of powerlessness before the terrifying unknown.  About a half hour into the picture, I realized that this film was striking chords in my psyche that most movies never even come close to touching.  Spielberg really makes us feel what it would be like if everything we took for granted were suddenly snatched away from us and we were forced to confront a menace we didn't understand and against which we had no defenses.  In a post-9/11 world, that is a very chilling and powerful concept indeed.Cruise and young Dakota Fanning do a beautiful job playing off one another in their many scenes together, making a real connection with us in the audience.  Tim Robbins is effective as a somewhat crazed survivor who allows the family to hide in his farmhouse, even if the scenes there, though good, turn out to be the weakest in the film.Some people have objected to the rather abrupt ending of the movie, but anyone familiar with the Wells original knows that Spielberg is merely being faithful to the author's own vision.  It seems rather petty to be getting on the man's case for his fidelity to a well-respected source when moviemakers are so often criticized for not remaining true to their material.""War of the Worlds"" is that rare genre film that seeps into your bones, taps into some of your most primal fears, and makes you look at the world in a different way the moment you step out of the theater.  But then that has been Spielberg's hallmark as a director all along.  Chalk up another triumph for the master.",5,pulse-pounding sci-fi thriller,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,5466,"['stunning', 'remake', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Steven', 'Spielberg',

635514,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JNTI,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 4]","Spielberg burns a lot of Hollywood oil with his version of ""War of the Worlds"" and yet turns out what I think is a coldly earnest and sincere epic of surprising emotional depth.Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a working-class stiff estranged from his wife and children (early in the film, we learn that Ray's daughter is allergic to peanuts. A fact that Ray picks up on at about the same time).  Ray has barely started an unpromising weekend with his young daughter and older teenage son when the invasion begins.  Unlike the war machines in both the novel and the '53 movie, those in Spielberg's WotW appear to have been buried under us for years (the film channels both the George Pal movie and Wells's original novel, and with war machines digging themselves out of the pit, even Professor Quatermass gets a nod).  Grabbing his kids, Ray has no better idea than to head for Boston and reunite with his wife, even as it becomes clear that machines like the one in Ray's backyard are popping up all over the place.  Soon Ray's journey will become one less of distance than in meaning, as he and family journey across a planet that is slowly but surely slipping from the grasp of mankind.  Martian machines are invulnerable to man's weapons and pluck at the helpless human beings below; meanwhile alien plantation begins sprouting everywhere.Mirroring the plight of their planet, surviving humans become alienated from each other as well - the ultimate personification of which is Ogilvy (Tim Robbins) as a fiery type meant to evoke a David Koresh character waiting to lead a resistance against the invaders.  Through it all, Ray remains tragically human - mostly because he needs to protect his young daughter.  He shields her from the horrors of the invasion, and she anchors his humanity - even when he's driven to desperation, he has his daughter wear a blindfold and sing a song so that she not directly witness the ends that Ray will go to protect her.For a story that's hardly all that fresh (the '53 flick was one of my favorites, and I must have watched it dozens of times by my early teens), Spielberg manages to tell his story well.  None of his characters are scientists, so we don't have a story that takes the easy way out with tons of invented technobbale.  Ray is just a guy who wants to go to Boston and keep his kids safe.  We know what happens to the Martians, but Spielberg rediscovers Well's original question - namely, while humans will ultimately survive, what happens to our humanity?

635528,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JNTI,Samuel McKewon,"[5, 6]","""The War of the Worlds"" is a gritty, gross, ominous tale of alien invasion until the last five minutes, when the sun literally comes out and the movie goes cream cheese on us. Whether this ending is faithful to H.G. Wells source novel isn't the point. It's a slap in the face to the style of picture director Steven Spielberg has given us: A street-level account of the terror, chaos and fear that ensues after the aliens begin their attack.What a strange, retro nightmare the first hour is. Focusing on deadbeat dad Ray (Tom Cruise) and the two children he has for the weekend (Justin Chatlin and Dakota Fanning), screenwriters David Koepp and Josh Friedman don't reveal the origins of the aliens or, initially, their intentions.When the tripods emerge from underground New York on whiplike metal legs, belching their warning call and literally erasing people with ray weapons, a helpless, visceral panic sets in: It's happening, it's unbelievable, and the sky is filled with smoke and dust and death. Run and duck, if you're not frozen with shock.Sound like 9/11? It's meant to; there's airplane wreckage in one scene, and in another Fanning asks, ""Is it the terrorists?"" There are echoes of the Holocaust - river-bloated corpses, mass extermination and disposal - and our recent Iraqi War - ""Occupations never work."" ""The War of the Worlds"" exmaines the affects of paranoia, both in mobs and a single survivalist named Ogilvy, played by Tim Robbins, mirroring his character from ""Mystic River,"" accent and all. Axe and rifle in hand, Ogilvy is deranged. Ray is not, so it makes sense when Ogilvy accuses him: ""You and me aren't on the same page.""That liberal subtext probably coaxed critics to praise ""War of the Worlds"" more than it deserves; the blue-collar moviegoer may find the movie only suspensful in parts. For one thing, it looks like it ran out of money: After the alien tripods attack a ferry full of refugees Spielberg doesn't have much more spectacle to offer; in keeping with the ""on-the-ground"" point of view, a lot of things are half seen. Both ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""Minority Report"" were more visually inventive.The awe of the aliens turns into our disgust of them as they litter the countryside with either their entrails or offspring, I couldn't decide which. When Ogilvy discovers the aliens' master plan, you sincerely wonder what they were doing evaporating people in the movie's first half. And why they're even here, after you consider their demise, would be a legitimate question posed to their apparent intelligence.The few actors you'd recognize are unmemorable: Cruise preens in the opening moments, but that persona falls away - you end up wondering why his kids are so strange, especially the son, an annoying, disrespectful jerk with a pointless urge to fight the aliens. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" had its flaws, but it appreciated the father/son relationship at its center and gave it some depth.Everybody else, including Fanning, is screaming, crying, pointing and freaking. It's accurate and unsettling, but not precisely enjoyable. You might have said ""cool"" during ""Independence Day."" You are less likely here.Which brings us to the ending. ""The War of the Worlds"" is a Spielberg show. You're gonna get a silver lining.

The aliens aren't extraterrestrials -- they are boogie men, born of our very human fear of the dark.  The method and motivation for their attack on us are nonsensical -- lay down machines a million years in advance, so they can invade and drink the blood of a species on another planet that barely exists when they came here to hide the machines?  What will they eat while you're waiting?  How could their alien biochemistry possibly manage to digest us?  Wouldn't it be a lot cheaper to raise animals for the blood they need on their own planet?

Clever director's ""improvements"" usually fall flat. This movie does pretty well in that regard.While modernizing the setting, Spielberg has employed the clever device of having the aliens employ an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) to disable all communications and most electrical devices, thus rendering his setting back to the 19th century. Like the novel, we see what happens from the perspective of an individual, rather than MSNBC. On the other hand, having the alien machines buried in the earth for 1 million years and then waiting until after humans have modern weapons to decide to attack (why not pull up the schedule by 1,000 years and fight bows and arrows?) is silly and unnecessary. The other thing is that the aliens are far too agile compared to Wells', but since we don't really know they're from Mars that's probably OK.Spielberg includes many elements of the novel, such as the ""red weed"" and people being collected in baskets, although he doesn't explain why the people are rendered into red liquid. Nor does he explain, as Wells did, why the aliens would be so stupid as to forget about what did them in at the end. Unfortunately, he does allow the aliens to have ""shields"" to make up for the fact that the humans have heat seeking missiles instead of artillery, but this is unnecessary - the aliens have sheer numbers and deadly accurate heat rays, so they could shoot down anything thrown at them. But Spielberg does omit the silly scene from the 50s movie where the Martians conveniently bunch up in one place so that they can be nuked by a single bomb.A lot of people don't like the ending or the overemphasis on the characters or morality. As Wells said himself, the science fantasy is just the backdrop for the message he wanted to convey, that the beings on both sides are too smart for their own britches and have forgotten their roots.",4,Pretty close to the original novel,1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,2045,"['movie', 'going', 'exploit', 'title', 'reputation', 'classic', 'novel', 'based', 'obligation', 'be', 'reasonably', 'close', 'adaptation', 'original', 'Clever', 'director', 'improvements', 'usually', 'fall', 'flat', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well', 'regard.While', 'modernizing', 'setting', 'Spielberg', 'employed', 'clever', 'device', 'having', 'aliens', 'employ', 'electromagnetic', 'pulse', 'EMP', 'disable', 'communications', 'most', 'electrical', 'devices', 'thus', 'rendering', 'setting', 'back', '19th', 'century', 'novel', 'see', 'what', 'perspective', 'individual', 'rather', 'MSNBC', 'other', 'hand', 'having', 'alien', 'machines', 'buried', 'earth', '1', 'million', 'years', 'then', 'waiting', 'humans', 'have', 'modern', 'weapons', 'decide', 'attack', 'why', 'not', 'pull', 'up', 'schedule', '1,000', 'years', 'fight', 'bows', 'arrows', 'silly', 'unnecessary', 'other', 'thing', 'aliens', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'agile', 'compared', 'Wells', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', ""'re"", 'Mars', 'probably', 'OK.Spielberg', 'many', 'elements', 'novel', 'such', 'red', 'weed', 'people', 'being', 'collected', 'baskets', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'rendered', 'red', 'liquid', 'explain', 'Wells', 'did', 'why', 'aliens', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'stupid', 'forget', 'what', 'did', 'end', 'Unfortunately', 'allow', 'aliens', 'have', 'shields', 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'humans', 'have', 'heat', 'seeking', 'missiles', 'instead', 'artillery', 'unnecessary', 'aliens', 'have', 'sheer', 'numbers', 'deadly', 'accurate', 'heat', 'rays', 'could', 'shoot', 'down', 'anything', 'thrown', 'Spielberg', 'omit', 'silly', 'scene', '50s', 'movie', 'where', 'Martians', 'conveniently', 'bunch', 'up', 'one', 'place', 'can', 'be', 'nuked', 'single', 'bomb.A', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'ending', 'overemphasis', 'characters', 'morality', 'Wells', 'said', 'science', 'fantasy', 'just', 'backdrop', 'message', 'wanted', 'convey', 'beings', 'sides', 'are', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'britches', 'have', 'forgotten', 'roots']",N/A
635536,AF1ER4SZR6EZ0,B00005JNTI,Sci Fi Fan,"[7, 17]","Who wrote this thing?  Who previewed this thing?  There is no plot, no humor, no heroes, no acting, no logic, or anything except special effects.  As I was leaving the theater, I risked saying to my wife that this was one of the worst movies I've seen in many years, even though she is the one who wanted to see it.  She fully agreed, and said that she thought of getting up and walking out in the middle.  It's really bad.Although it missed a lot of opportunities, the opening minutes do a decent job of capturing the look of the working neighborhood in New York and introducing the characters.  It was even tolerable up until the time that the first Martian tripod rose up.  Was it walking or floating?  Poor CGI.  The Martians machines later grow more legs, float, swim, grow other appendages, stomp on things, and otherwise change to suit the next crisis for Tom Cruise.  And that's the rest of the movie - Tom Cruise and his kids escaping from one set of Martians, going to another place for a short while, then meeting other Martians, then repeating this over and over.  It's like Spielberg said ""What would make a great CGI disaster with the Martians?"", then writing a story to make sure that Tom Cruise goes to each of those places.We also see masses of people running FROM the Martians, then others running TOWARD the Martians.  We see Martians vaporizing people, then collecting them.  We see Martians obliterating buildings, then going into one with Tom Cruise in it to explore it.  We see EMP taking out everything from watches to cars, but not a camcorder.  Spielberg missed a golden opportunity here to show that newer isn't always better.  Tom Cruise was driving an old muscle car - there aren't any computers in it!  It should have kept running, along with a lot of old stuff.  What a great contrast that should have been.So instead we see another car that has been magically repaired with new solenoids, even though most of the other electronics should have been fried.  Then if you have the only car that's working, and are carefully taking the back roads, why would you drive it into a crowd of desparate people?The whole basement scene is unbelievable, and the snakelike eye is a joke - nothing mechanical can move like that nor was it good CGI.  But I will give credit for interesting looking Martian creatures.I also have to suspect that Spielberg shot the battle between the Army and the Martians, but it probably looked too phony to include in the movie.  After Private Ryan, I expected to see a reasonable display of army tactics.  Instead we see a line of tanks waiting to be zapped, which occurs over a hill.  Again, think of the great contrasts in other movies of the Army confidently heading to fight the Martians, only to be surprised by the superiority of the Martian weapons.  We see none of this.The attempts at acting go from portraying being in shock - which is understandable - but people in shock would never be able to navigate back to their house, then suddenly snap out of it and prepare for a road trip.  There is an attempt at some type of divorced dad gets to bond with his kids story, but it is overwhelmed by CGI, shouting, disasters, and totally illogical actions.For the opening week, I was surprised how empty the theater was, but now I know why......I wasn't as smart as the people who stayed away......",1,Worst Movie I've see in many years,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,3352,"['Who', 'wrote', 'thing', 'Who', 'previewed', 'thing', 'plot', 'humor', 'heroes', 'acting', 'logic', 'anything', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'leaving', 'theater', 'risked', 'saying', 'wife', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'even', 'one', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'fully', 'agreed', 'said', 'thought', 'getting', 'up', 'walking', 'out', 'middle', 'really', 'missed', 'lot', 'opportunities', 'opening', 'minutes', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'capturing', 'look', 'working', 'neighborhood', 'New', 'York', 'introducing', 'characters', 'was', 'even', 'tolerable', 'up', 'time', 'first', 'Martian', 'tripod', 'rose', 'up', 'walking', 'floating', 'Poor', 'CGI', 'Martians', 'machines', 'later', 'grow', 'more', 'legs', 'float', 'swim', 'grow', 'other', 'appendages', 'stomp', 'things', 'otherwise', 'change', 'suit', 'next', 'crisis', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'rest', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'kids', 'escaping', 'one', 'set', 'Martians', 'going', 'place', 'short', 'while', 'then', 'meeting', 'other', 'Martians', 'then', 'repeating', 'over', 'over', 'Spielberg', 'said', 'What', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'CGI', 'disaster', 'Martians', 'then', 'writing', 'story', 'make', 'sure', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'places.We', 'also', 'see', 'masses', 'people', 'running', 'Martians', 'then', 'others', 'running', 'TOWARD', 'Martians', 'see', 'Martians', 'vaporizing', 'people', 'then', 'collecting', 'see', 'Martians', 'obliterating', 'buildings', 'then', 'going', 'one', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'explore', 'see', 'EMP', 'taking', 'out', 'everything', 'watches', 'cars', 'not', 'camcorder', 'Spielberg', 'missed', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'here', 'show', 'newer', ""n't"", 'always', 'better', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'driving', 'old', 'muscle', 'car', 'are', ""n't"", 'computers', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'running', 'lot', 'old', 'stuff', 'What', 'great', 'contrast', 'should', 'have', 'been.So', 'instead', 'see', 'car', 'been', 'magically', 'repaired', 'new', 'solenoids', 'even', 'most', 'other', 'electronics', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fried', 'Then', 'have', 'only', 'car', 'working', 'are', 'carefully', 'taking', 'back', 'roads', 'why', 'would', 'drive', 'crowd', 'desparate', 'people', 'whole', 'basement', 'scene', 'unbelievable', 'snakelike', 'eye', 'joke', 'nothing', 'mechanical', 'can', 'move', 'was', 'good', 'CGI', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'interesting', 'looking', 'Martian', 'creatures.I', 'also', 'have', 'suspect', 'Spielberg', 'shot', 'battle', 'Army', 'Martians', 'probably', 'looked', 'too', 'phony', 'include', 'movie', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'expected', 'see', 'reasonable', 'display', 'army', 'tactics', 'Instead', 'see', 'line', 'tanks', 'waiting', 'be', 'zapped', 'hill', 'Again', 'think', 'great', 'contrasts', 'other', 'movies', 'Army', 'confidently', 'heading', 'fight', 'Martians', 'only', 'be', 'surprised', 'superiority', 'Martian', 'weapons', 'see', 'none', 'this.The', 'attempts', 'acting', 'go', 'portraying', 'being', 'shock', 'understandable', 'people', 'shock', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'navigate', 'back', 'house', 'then', 'suddenly', 'prepare', 'road', 'trip', 'attempt', 'type', 'divorced', 'dad', 'bond', 'kids', 'story', 'overwhelmed', 'CGI', 'shouting', 'disasters', 'totally', 'illogical', 'opening', 'week', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'empty', 'theater', 'was', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'smart', 'people', 'who', 'stayed', 'away']",N/A

I felt a bit paranoid for about an hour after leaving the theatre having had my nerves racked constantly for almost two hours.  This is not a movie for kids, especially kids who have ever had nightmares after watching scary movies.  The sustained psychology of terror, of parents, adults, realistically loosing control, having to defend themselves in extreme ways, of senseless murder without known cause or provocation, making choices which child to protect are all themes in this film.The character Tim Robbins plays (and his spooky, initial appearance, head on, in the movie brought cheers and laughter because he was so right in that part) was in the original story.  That character was a mouth piece for conjecture about the ultimate fate of humanity under the dominion of the Martians (this movie does not connect the invaders to Mars).  The story character had some seemingly plausable ideas which initially inspired some hope in me when reading the story that humanity might survive, even reclaim its supremecy on Earth.  The movie did not develop this as well but did suggest that the character had some insight into survival.  In the end, in both movie and book, the character was found to be mentally unstable and the validity of his ideas were thereby compromised.  But this just highlights the importance of hope.  The movie might have developed further depth by intensifying this subplot making clear that we are not somehow special in the universe regarding our cleverness or adaptability when it comes to sheer, overwhelming power even when battling other intelligences.The movie can be interpreted to show that our fate rests in hands other than our own.  If one has incorporated traditional science into one's faith, then you can leave this movie with the impression that it was only by the grace of God and His creation that humanity was saved.  The conclusion to the movie may disappoint the American taste for happy endings through heroic action, but science fiction often succeeds most when it points out that the power of forces beyond our control are the substance of the greatest stories.",5,A study in powerlessness and terror,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,2238,"['Having', 'recently', 'read', 'book', 'now', 'having', 'just', 'seen', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'felt', 'bit', 'paranoid', 'hour', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'having', 'had', 'nerves', 'racked', 'constantly', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'not', 'movie', 'kids', 'especially', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'nightmares', 'watching', 'scary', 'movies', 'sustained', 'psychology', 'terror', 'parents', 'adults', 'realistically', 'loosing', 'control', 'having', 'defend', 'extreme', 'ways', 'senseless', 'murder', 'known', 'cause', 'provocation', 'making', 'choices', 'child', 'protect', 'are', 'themes', 'film.The', 'character', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'plays', 'spooky', 'initial', 'appearance', 'head', 'movie', 'brought', 'cheers', 'laughter', 'was', 'so', 'right', 'part', 'was', 'original', 'story', 'character', 'was', 'mouth', 'piece', 'conjecture', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'humanity', 'dominion', 'Martians', 'movie', 'not', 'connect', 'invaders', 'Mars', 'story', 'character', 'had', 'seemingly', 'plausable', 'ideas', 'initially', 'inspired', 'hope', 'when', 'reading', 'story', 'humanity', 'might', 'survive', 'even', 'reclaim', 'supremecy', 'Earth', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'develop', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'suggest', 'character', 'had', 'insight', 'survival', 'end', 'movie', 'book', 'character', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'validity', 'ideas', 'were', 'thereby', 'compromised', 'just', 'importance', 'hope', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'developed', 'further', 'depth', 'intensifying', 'subplot', 'making', 'clear', 'are', 'not', 'somehow', 'special', 'universe', 'regarding', 'cleverness', 'adaptability', 'when', 'sheer', 'overwhelming', 'power', 'even', 'when', 'battling', 'other', 'intelligences.The', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'show', 'fate', 'rests', 'hands', 'other', 'own', 'one', 'incorporated', 'traditional', 'science', 'one', 'faith', 'then', 'can', 'leave', 'movie', 'impression', 'was', 'only', 'grace', 'God', 'creation', 'humanity', 'was', 'saved', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'may', 'disappoint', 'American', 'taste', 'happy', 'endings', 'heroic', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'often', 'most', 'when', 'out', 'power', 'forces', 'control', 'are', 'substance', 'greatest', 'stories']",N/A

I had the movie on VHS and now on DVD and admired the stellar, believable special effects and sound effects for a film of a more primitive era technologically speaking. In the original 1953 film, as with the novel, the intentions of the aliens are not immediately known as many innocents approach with child-like naivet&eacute;, ready and willing to make peace with the unexpected visitors.In this Spielberg adaptation, it becomes very clear very fast, that these aliens are not visitors, but conquerers. Their intent seems eerily similar to the way we would approach roaches with a can of spray... no regard for the lives whatsoever or a desire to dialogue. The aliens make no announcements, they simply erradicate people like bugs.The sound effects are creepy and the visage of the tripods towering over the cities and rural landscapes is chilling. I wondered how Spielberg was going to come close to the creepy sounds of the '53 classic. Unbelievably, Spielberg trumps the original in the fear factor.Despite Tom Cruise's recent public outbursts of love and whackiness, his acting is so good in this film, you really are able to forget about his recent antics and get involved. Dakota Fanning is no slouch, either. Where in the heck is this kid's Oscar? She should have gotten one for ""I Am Sam,"" in opinion... and her performance is flawless here.Tim Robbins does well as the understandibly disturbed former EMT hell-bent on destroying the aliens a-la David vs. Goliath, no matter how hopeless his surroundings.The film does make some silly assertions that are not only not necessary, but a ridiculous distraction. When the origin of the aliens is discussed and explored, it just doesn't jibe with what modern 21st century movie goers know about science and science fiction. The meteors that fell in the 1953 version might have been a stumbling block to the scriptwriters... now that NASA is working on zapping meteors thousands of miles away from the earth - but there could have been a better explanation than what was offered... heck, why do they even need an explanation? I don't want to plant any spoilers here, but the supposition of when and how the aliens began their assault on the earth just doesn't jibe with logic.The film is intense, scary and gross. There is an abundance of carnage and blood-sucking that would have had 1953 film-goers fainting in the aisles. This is simply not suitable for youngsters... it is too real and too disturbing. Despite its shortcomings, this film exceeded my expectations. It still gives me goosebumps weeks after first viewing it on the big screen.The aliens in this new rendition are far more sinister than the almost ""cute"" versions in the '53 saga... far less sympathetic and more vile by a long-shot. This version does not replace the '53 version, but serves as a modern-day homage to it. I'd like to see a 2-volume DVD with both movie versions and commentaries comparing the two and the novel... and the Orson Welles radio drama as well.

Okay, maybe this isn't THAT bad, but it's got more than enough massive plot and logic holes to look like a sequel to ID4. Some suspension of disbelief is acceptable in a film of this nature... but wow, Spielburg's just incredibly lazy in this one.For example:The EMP that the aliens emit. It SHOULD take out everything electronic within its radius. Yet we see Army vehicles, cameras, VCRs all functioning normally. Conversely, a vehicle that should NOT be affected is Ray's '66 Mustang, which does not have an electronic ignition computer and thus would run unimpeded by an EMP. This is widely known in survivalist circles, and would've been cool to at least acknowledge (after all, Mustang = rad chase car). Instead, our hero replaces a minivan's solenoid (when it's really the ignition that would be fried and a much harder fix) and uses that.A passenger jetliner crashes into the front yard at their Mom's house, and not only is the house not completely decimated in a raging inferno, but their vehicle is unscratched (!!) as well.Tom Cruise, who is just under 5'5"" takes on the 6'-plus Tim Robbins with a shovel and wins. Huh?The alien heat rays can decimate buildings and reduce humans to clouds of dust, but apparently cotton clothes don't get instantly incinerated along with them.People can fall over 50 feet from the clutches of an alien capture basket and walk away unharmed. Lucky, huh?Why did the aliens not just capture prehistoric Earth when they got there, instead of planting sleeper cell-like units deep underground?  You could make the argument that the aliens (shown later feeding on humans) needed humans for sustenance, but in that case why would they go out of their way to pillage and destroy so many?How does one travel to Boston from Upstate New York (REPRESENT!.. oh.. sorry) via minivan on one tank of gas? ""It's in the script.""The hero's older son joins some troops in stopping the aliens, and shortly after that a massive explosion kills them all--or so we would be given to think, considering the size of the blast and all. And yet, he shows up again at the end of the movie, unharmed. Double-U-Tee-Eff?The ending is the biggest deus ex machina I've ever seen. I won't spoil it for you, but stay clear of the popcorn lest you choke to death from the sudden hit of stupidity. So implausible and corny. Damn, and I thought Spielburg would've learned something from the lame ending of Saving Private Ryan.The parallels to 9/11 are tasteless and typical Hollywood pandering. Remember, these are the same people who wag their fingers and cast blame on America's global policy  for everything wrong in the world today from the safety of their limos.The acting sucks. Cruise as a deadbeat mechanic dad turns in one of his usual bland performances--passable, hardly inspiring. Both kids, but ESPECIALLY Dakota Fanning, are irritating enough to make me reconsider my stance on child abuse. Tim Robbins (*cough*pinko*cough*.. excuse me) actually manages believability with his performance as an ambulance driver and willing provider of refuge to our main characters who's quickly coming undone by the surrounding horror.Kudos to the actual appearance of the tripods themselves, which are actually credibly scary as they devastate everything around them, and have a real sense of power and mass that eludes most CGI creations (the ferry scene, shot in my beloved Hudson River in Athens NY, was particularly rad).

635550,A3EAU736LWTDCE,B00005JNTI,sinisterfiend666,"[3, 8]","(probably closer to 4 stars, but I must offset the haters):I saw the original 50's version and I liked it a lot. (I saw it back in the late 70's when I was a kid). So I already knew how the movie was going to end. Which means the ending wasn't a big problem, or a let down for me. I always thought the ending made sense. So many reviewers are saying it doesn't make sense. Have you ever studied biology? Look up topics about introducing new species into different ecosystems and see what you find! I just don't see how so many people don't ""get it"".Anyway, I'm also a horror movie fan, and from a horror aspect, I think this movie did a good job of capturing terror. People say there is no plot. Well, what do you mean? There is definitely a plot, It just happens to be a simple one: ""run and save you're a$$ before you die!"" it's pretty much the universal plot of 70% of all horror movies. This is the stuff that nightmares are made of. As others mentioned, they didn't spend too much time developing the characters, but by not doing so, I actually felt more like I was in the film (like this family could be anyone, including my own). I liked the movie because it was fast passed and suspenseful. It only had a couple slow spots. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Tom's acting was good, the FX were amazing, and the concept was good. Some people also missed the point of this movie all together: the movie was more about human nature than an alien invasion. Examples: someone would beat you and your family down for your own car to save their life. People would also loot and steel during times of crisis. Even though I did enjoy the movie and I do think it is getting a bad rap, I have a few minor complaints: from the original version, I would have liked to see the scientists involvement. The military involvement wasn't nearly extensive in this movie as it was the original. As someone else mentioned, it would have been nice to see the head-to-head battle with the military instead of a hillside battle lightshow. So I guess in general I would have liked to seen more alien battles\destruction sequences (even though it has quite a bit). Finally, my favorite scene is gone. I really wish they would have added the church/prayer scene into the remake that the original had. It gave the movie a religious aspect to it that this one didn't have.Verdict: good movie, go see it!P.S. loved the addition of the blood!",5,A review from someone who has actually seen it (and liked it),1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,2423,"['probably', 'closer', '4', 'stars', 'must', 'offset', 'haters', 'saw', 'original', '50', 'version', 'liked', 'lot', 'saw', 'back', 'late', '70', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'already', 'knew', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'problem', 'let', 'down', 'always', 'thought', 'ending', 'made', 'sense', 'So', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'saying', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Have', 'ever', 'studied', 'biology', 'Look', 'up', 'topics', 'introducing', 'new', 'species', 'different', 'ecosystems', 'see', 'what', 'find', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', '.Anyway', ""'m"", 'also', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'horror', 'aspect', 'think', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'terror', 'People', 'say', 'plot', 'Well', 'what', 'do', 'mean', 'definitely', 'plot', 'just', 'be', 'simple', 'one', 'run', 'save', ""'re"", 'die', 'pretty', 'much', 'universal', 'plot', '70', '%', 'horror', 'movies', 'stuff', 'nightmares', 'are', 'made', 'others', 'mentioned', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'actually', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'film', 'family', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'including', 'own', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'fast', 'passed', 'suspenseful', 'only', 'had', 'couple', 'slow', 'spots', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'Tom', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'FX', 'were', 'amazing', 'concept', 'was', 'good', 'people', 'also', 'missed', 'point', 'movie', 'together', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'human', 'nature', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Examples', 'someone', 'would', 'beat', 'family', 'down', 'own', 'car', 'save', 'life', 'People', 'would', 'also', 'loot', 'steel', 'times', 'crisis', 'Even', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'do', 'think', 'getting', 'bad', 'rap', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'complaints', 'original', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'scientists', 'involvement', 'military', 'involvement', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'extensive', 'movie', 'was', 'original', 'someone', 'else', 'mentioned', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'head-to-head', 'battle', 'military', 'instead', 'hillside', 'battle', 'lightshow', 'guess', 'general', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seen', 'more', 'alien', 'battles\\destruction', 'sequences', 'even', 'quite', 'bit', 'Finally', 'favorite', 'scene', 'gone', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'church/prayer', 'scene', 'remake', 'original', 'had', 'gave', 'movie', 'religious', 'aspect', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have.Verdict', 'good', 'movie', 'go', 'see', 'P.S', 'loved', 'addition', 'blood']",N/A
635551,A1VR1W21LV4ZME,B00005JNTI,"sir robin ""john""","[3, 8]","So far, this is the best DVD of the year.  The Limited 2 - disc edition of War of the Worlds is fantastic in every aspect.  Here's why:THE MOVIE - The movie itself is quite good.  I liked it, and despite what others here would like you to believe, I am not a bumbling idiot.  As a fan of action movies, I found this one to be way above par.The story itself, you probably already know.  Aliens attack, and Tom Cruise runs with his family to safety.  It is very fast paced and relentless, something exciting happens in every scene.The characters, I'll admit, aren't the best.  Fortunately, this is the type of movie you wouldn't want to spend too much time on character developement.  For a disaster flick, the characters are more interesting than most would be.The action is the real strong point of this film.  The visuals Steve creates are amazing.  The best scene is the first scene with a tripod.  It comes out of the ground.  People look on, amazed, scared, and confused.  Suddenly, it lets out a bellowing roar, and all hell breaks lose as it comepletely destroys a whole block in less than a minute.  It doesn't end there.  Speilburg keeps the tension up even when the characters find refuge in a basement.  Ray and Olgivy (Robbins) are constantly looking out the window as tripods suck the blood of the innocent.It's soooooo hip to say that this movie has a bad screenplay, but that's just stupid.  People who say that, are just trying to sound smart.  The dialogue is very naturalistic, it's no Tarrantino, but it shouldn't be.  It has much better writing than Jurrassic Park (another great movie), but nobody points that out.  They are just saying it to boost their self-esteem or somethin.The ending was not so bad.  It was just, a tad too happy.  Doesn't ruin the movie by any means.THE EXTRAS:  The extras are very good.  There is a little butt-kissin, yeah, but there also is alot of information about the film.  The best of all the featurettes are the production diaries.  They are very comprehensive.  The only DVD special features better are the Lord of the Rings: Extended Editions.  And thats saying alot.PICTURE:  The picture is good.  I heard lots of rumors about terrible picture and blah blah blah.  But it's good.  Speilburg put a grain on the film, but it actually makes it look better.  It's more gritty and real.SOUND:  Wow, the sound is good.Overall, this is great DVD that's at least worth a rent.  War of the Worlds is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is very interesting in it's style and presentation of material.  Not to mention, the special FX are the most realistic I've ever seen.",5,Fantastic DVD,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2623,"['So', 'far', 'best', 'DVD', 'year', 'Limited', '2', 'disc', 'edition', 'War', 'Worlds', 'fantastic', 'aspect', 'Here', 'why', 'MOVIE', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'liked', 'what', 'others', 'here', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'am', 'not', 'bumbling', 'idiot', 'fan', 'action', 'movies', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'way', 'par.The', 'story', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'Aliens', 'attack', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'family', 'safety', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'relentless', 'something', 'exciting', 'happens', 'scene.The', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'Fortunately', 'type', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'character', 'developement', 'disaster', 'flick', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'most', 'would', 'be.The', 'action', 'real', 'strong', 'point', 'film', 'visuals', 'Steve', 'creates', 'are', 'amazing', 'best', 'scene', 'first', 'scene', 'tripod', 'ground', 'People', 'look', 'amazed', 'scared', 'confused', 'Suddenly', 'out', 'bellowing', 'roar', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'comepletely', 'whole', 'block', 'less', 'minute', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'Speilburg', 'tension', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'characters', 'find', 'refuge', 'basement', 'Ray', 'Olgivy', 'Robbins', 'are', 'constantly', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'tripods', 'suck', 'blood', 'innocent.It', 'soooooo', 'hip', 'say', 'movie', 'bad', 'screenplay', 'just', 'stupid', 'People', 'who', 'say', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'sound', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'very', 'naturalistic', 'Tarrantino', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'writing', 'Jurrassic', 'Park', 'great', 'movie', 'nobody', 'points', 'out', 'are', 'just', 'saying', 'boost', 'self-esteem', 'somethin.The', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'happy', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'means.THE', 'EXTRAS', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'little', 'butt-kissin', 'yeah', 'there', 'also', 'alot', 'information', 'film', 'best', 'featurettes', 'are', 'production', 'diaries', 'are', 'very', 'comprehensive', 'only', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'better', 'are', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Extended', 'Editions', 'thats', 'saying', 'alot.PICTURE', 'picture', 'good', 'heard', 'lots', 'rumors', 'terrible', 'picture', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'good', 'Speilburg', 'put', 'grain', 'film', 'actually', 'look', 'better', 'more', 'gritty', 'real.SOUND', 'Wow', 'sound', 'good.Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'least', 'rent', 'War', 'Worlds', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'means', 'very', 'interesting', 'style', 'presentation', 'material', 'Not', 'mention', 'special', 'FX', 'are', 'most', 'realistic', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

If you've seen the original or read HG Wells' story you know how it ends.And that's the part that was so cool.

The child actors did excellent jobs, particularly the young girl, Cruise himself never makes a bad movie (IMHO), he is so well suited to the action/sci - fi genre too. One of the things that troubled me about the movie is when Cruise murders? the good samaritan refugee in the basement, the guy took him in and that is how he gets repaid! The movie itself falters about twenty five minutes from the end, it just stopped being interesting, the great pace and tension of the previous hour or so evaporated - i would have preferred an ending in which the ultimate outcome of the war was left unclear.

He told that to Matt Lauer on TV, and doesn't he know what that means--lack of intellecutal depth. Now, if someone doesn't believe in anti-depression drugs because they really could work for those who are ill due to depression...it seems he is the one who lacks depth. Plus, he believes in a ""religion"" (cult) that came out of the mind of a guy in the 70's. I call that following something ..like the followers ofKoresh.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[0, 0]","Aliens have invaded the earth in many movies, but not one of these movies had Tom Cruise running around with a child in his arms. So, Steven Spielberg bought the rights to remake the original War Of The Worlds and cast Cruise in the lead role with Dakota Fanning as the child star.The movie has its classic moments. The first 25 minutes of the movie are quite breathtaking. After we see the huge alien shooting his rays at people and in the process turning them to ashes, we get the point. Actually, we get the sense that we've seen this movie before under a different title with the same special effects.The movie deals with the sentiments of survival, tragedy, and hope; that's exactly what previous disaster films like Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow dealt with too.Despite that the movie has nothing new to offer the viewers, War Of The Worlds will not fail to entertain you for 2 straight hours. By the final 20 minutes, I was wondering how on earth they were going to end it (keep in mind that I haven't seen the original) and when it does end, you don't realize it did until Morgan Freeman's narration explains what happened.Watch out for Tim Robbins in a very small screen time, and quite unnecessary if you ask me. He plays an underground resistance fighter. I realize that Tom Cruise could have handled the scene with Robbins all by himself. Is it the fact that Spielberg wanted to add Robbins for the sake of having an Oscar winner in the movie. Most definitely!On the other hand, Dakota Fanning is the sweetest child actor around today. She has a definite future ahead of her in movies, I just hope Hollywood doesn't exploit her when she gets older.Not really recommended unless you're a die hard fan of Cruise or special effects films.C",3,There's nothing new about War Of The Worlds,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,1761,"['Aliens', 'have', 'invaded', 'earth', 'many', 'movies', 'not', 'one', 'movies', 'had', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'running', 'around', 'child', 'arms', 'So', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'bought', 'rights', 'remake', 'original', 'War', 'Worlds', 'cast', 'Cruise', 'lead', 'role', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'child', 'star.The', 'movie', 'classic', 'moments', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'see', 'huge', 'alien', 'shooting', 'rays', 'people', 'process', 'turning', 'ashes', 'get', 'point', 'Actually', 'get', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'different', 'title', 'same', 'special', 'effects.The', 'movie', 'deals', 'sentiments', 'survival', 'tragedy', 'hope', 'exactly', 'what', 'previous', 'disaster', 'films', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'dealt', 'too.Despite', 'movie', 'nothing', 'new', 'offer', 'viewers', 'War', 'Worlds', 'will', 'not', 'fail', 'entertain', '2', 'straight', 'hours', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'earth', 'were', 'going', 'end', 'keep', 'mind', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'when', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'did', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'narration', 'what', 'happened.Watch', 'out', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'very', 'small', 'screen', 'time', 'quite', 'unnecessary', 'ask', 'underground', 'resistance', 'fighter', 'realize', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'scene', 'Robbins', 'fact', 'Spielberg', 'wanted', 'add', 'Robbins', 'sake', 'having', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'movie', 'Most', 'definitely', 'other', 'hand', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'sweetest', 'child', 'actor', 'today', 'definite', 'future', 'ahead', 'movies', 'just', 'hope', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'when', 'older.Not', 'really', 'recommended', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Cruise', 'special', 'effects', 'films.C']",N/A

Except for the initial shock and awe presentation of the aliens, screenplay sucks. needed at least five more rewrites, including a smarter little girl. Tom Cruise's character is well enough written but his son and daughter characters needed a whole lot more work. acting is fine.P.S. Potential fixes -have Cruise's character somehow involved in taking out essential section of alien organization, which would mean the writer would have to understand alien culture and explain it to us;do not have aliens fail due to scientific incompetence, especially given that they have figured out how to do long distance space travel, and we have not. given the science that they'd have to have mastered just to get here, it is nonsensical that they wouldn't perform a biological compatibility test between themselves and earth. just drop that story idea as it is too dumb;make Tom Cruise's kids characters smart, not to compete with him storywise, but make them smart as a reflection on him. dumb characters push the audience right out of the story. the teenager could've been separated by a landslide, some other type of accidence, anything but having him run off during an alien attack, abandoning his father and his little sister, against the express wishes of his father; andgive the little girl some work to do. in other words, let every character carry some story weight and don't waste the audience's time with nitwits or nonsensical story setups.",2,story doesn't work because (spoilers)...,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,2536,"['1', 'work', 'good', 'guys', 'failure', 'invasion', 'nothing', 'do', 'human', 'ingenuity/resistance', 'so', 'are', 'heroines/hero', 'only', 'fortunate', 'survivors', 'liked', 'tie-end', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'work', 'up', 'high', 'ability', 'think', 'when', 'captured', 'high', 'alien', 'holding', 'pen', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'story-wise', 'needed', 'do', 'significant', 'work', 'defeating', '2', 'incompetent', 'villains', 'are', 'unimpressive', 'aliens', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'thorough', 'scientific', 'investigation', 'planet', 'so', 'shot', 'foot', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'given', 'species', 'supposedly', 'capable', 'inter-galactic', 'space', 'travel', 'unbelievable', 'advanced', 'species', 'would', 'fail', 'perform', 'basic', 'biology', 'compatibility', 'analysis', 'potential', 'host', 'planet', 'be', 'sort', 'flying', 'moon', 'arrival', 'taking', 'soil', 'environment', 'tests', 'removing', 'helmets', '3', 'unbelievable', 'son', 'behavior', 'sane', 'teenager', 'would', 'run', 'away', 'father', 'trying', 'protect', 'alien', 'invasion', 'death', 'destruction', 'initial', 'shock', 'awe', 'presentation', 'aliens', 'screenplay', 'sucks', 'needed', 'least', 'five', 'more', 'rewrites', 'including', 'smarter', 'little', 'girl', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'well', 'enough', 'written', 'son', 'daughter', 'characters', 'needed', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'acting', 'fine.P.S', 'Potential', 'fixes', '-have', 'Cruise', 'character', 'somehow', 'involved', 'taking', 'out', 'essential', 'section', 'alien', 'organization', 'would', 'mean', 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'understand', 'alien', 'culture', 'explain', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'aliens', 'fail', 'due', 'scientific', 'incompetence', 'especially', 'given', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'do', 'long', 'distance', 'space', 'travel', 'have', 'not', 'given', 'science', ""'d"", 'have', 'have', 'mastered', 'just', 'get', 'here', 'nonsensical', 'would', ""n't"", 'perform', 'biological', 'compatibility', 'test', 'earth', 'just', 'drop', 'story', 'idea', 'too', 'dumb', 'make', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'kids', 'characters', 'smart', 'not', 'compete', 'storywise', 'make', 'smart', 'reflection', 'dumb', 'characters', 'push', 'audience', 'right', 'story', 'teenager', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'separated', 'landslide', 'other', 'type', 'accidence', 'anything', 'having', 'run', 'off', 'alien', 'attack', 'abandoning', 'father', 'little', 'sister', 'express', 'wishes', 'father', 'little', 'girl', 'work', 'do', 'other', 'words', 'let', 'character', 'carry', 'story', 'weight', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'audience', 'time', 'nitwits', 'nonsensical', 'story', 'setups']",N/A

635562,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00005JNTI,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[1, 3]","I saw ""War of the Worlds"" for two basic reasons:  I'm a fan of the George Pal original and the H.G. Wells novel, and I'd hoped beyond all hope to see Tom Cruise get vaporized onscreen.  That's nothing against Cruise personally; it's just that I'd rather see a character played by him get vaporized early on than actually have to watch Cruise for an entire film.This is not a new feeling, one born of his juvenile antics on ""Oprah"" and rumored efforts to eschew whispers of homosexuality by pawing at Katie Holmes in public every chance he gets, but a yearning I have harbored for years.  Of course, Hollywood disappointed me again, in much the same way that I had to sit all the way through ""Titanic"" before finally getting to see Leonardo DiCaprio's character drown.That's not to say that Cruise's character is a true disappointment.  He's exactly the hotheaded, neaderthalic, juiced-up on steroids, ex-high school suburban wrestler type that Cruise should always be cast as, as it seems he was bred for just such roles.  In this, his performance is right on target.  As the de facto leader of the clan he helped pro-create and little else, he would seem more like one of the kids -- angry, resentful, clueless -- if not for Dakota Fanning, who in a sometimes truly creepy way seems to be a middle-aged woman trapped in little girl's body.  Like the extras, they all spend most of their time running and hiding in this film (when not bickering), which is just one reason the plot and pacing seem so lethargic:  Aren't characters supposed to actually confront their obstacles?The story stays more or less with the Wells original in that Martians invade Earth, though there's a twist:  the invasion actually happened millions of years ago.  For reasons unknown and easily explained by a simple speculative conversation between scientists that never materializes, war machines come suddenly to life, bent on exterminating all humans in their path and transforming the planet into a Martian paradise.  That's pretty much all that happens, with the exception of a brief foray into lunacy with Tim Robbins.Unless you see yourself in the characters, you don't really care much whether they survive or not, and the film makes little effort to change your mind.  (Unlike the Pal film, which was steeped in pathos and not a little bit of intelligence, this one is more interested in mood and atmosphere than character; for a lesson from the former, watch the scene where the minister, a good, decent man, tries to make peace with the Martians before he -- and the surrounding army -- get confirmation that this is an invasion, not a visit.)There are moments that unintentionally mystify, such as how a mechanic is oblivous to WW III happening a couple of blocks from his shop, Cruise's daughter not only suddenly losing her claustrophobia but actually hiding in several dark and enclosed spaces without effort or protest, the fact that aliens have engineered a complex invasion and mastered interstellar space travel but somehow don't think to put some clothes on before they start the fireworks, and why the army doesn't just blow the ground from underneath the rampaging machines instead of trying to attack them from above.  Sci-fi used to be for smart people.In the end, Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" is mostly an overhyped, underdeveloped special effects film which delivers a few innovations in visual and audio pyrotechnics (though even they are limited; the film's big battle all happens on the other side of a hill).  The characters are cardboard, the story is virtually nonexistent, the product placement is obvious -- but, hey, that's what the market wants nowadays, right?  And Spielberg is the king of Hollywood marketing, at least for audiences that are willing to shell out [...] for the viewing and then more for the DVD.  I will say, though, that it was nice to see cameos by Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, stars of Pal's superior 1953 version, though it would have been nicer if they'd been in a better movie.",3,The Original is Much Better,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,4018,"['saw', 'War', 'Worlds', 'two', 'basic', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'fan', 'George', 'Pal', 'original', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'novel', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'hope', 'see', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'get', 'vaporized', 'onscreen', 'nothing', 'Cruise', 'personally', 'just', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'character', 'played', 'get', 'vaporized', 'early', 'actually', 'have', 'watch', 'Cruise', 'entire', 'film.This', 'not', 'new', 'feeling', 'one', 'born', 'juvenile', 'antics', 'Oprah', 'rumored', 'efforts', 'eschew', 'whispers', 'homosexuality', 'pawing', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'public', 'chance', 'yearning', 'have', 'harbored', 'years', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'disappointed', 'again', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'had', 'sit', 'way', 'Titanic', 'finally', 'getting', 'see', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'character', 'drown.That', 'not', 'say', 'Cruise', 'character', 'true', 'disappointment', 'exactly', 'hotheaded', 'neaderthalic', 'juiced-up', 'steroids', 'ex-high', 'school', 'suburban', 'wrestler', 'type', 'Cruise', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'cast', 'as', 'was', 'bred', 'just', 'such', 'roles', 'performance', 'right', 'target', 'de', 'facto', 'leader', 'clan', 'helped', 'pro-create', 'little', 'else', 'would', 'seem', 'more', 'one', 'kids', 'angry', 'resentful', 'clueless', 'not', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'sometimes', 'truly', 'creepy', 'way', 'be', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'trapped', 'little', 'girl', 'body', 'extras', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'running', 'hiding', 'film', 'when', 'not', 'bickering', 'just', 'one', 'reason', 'plot', 'pacing', 'seem', 'so', 'lethargic', 'Are', ""n't"", 'characters', 'supposed', 'actually', 'confront', 'obstacles', 'story', 'more', 'less', 'Wells', 'original', 'Martians', 'invade', 'Earth', 'twist', 'invasion', 'actually', 'happened', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'easily', 'explained', 'simple', 'speculative', 'conversation', 'scientists', 'never', 'war', 'machines', 'come', 'suddenly', 'life', 'bent', 'exterminating', 'humans', 'path', 'transforming', 'planet', 'Martian', 'paradise', 'pretty', 'much', 'exception', 'brief', 'foray', 'lunacy', 'Tim', 'Robbins.Unless', 'see', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'much', 'survive', 'not', 'film', 'little', 'effort', 'change', 'mind', 'Pal', 'film', 'was', 'steeped', 'pathos', 'not', 'little', 'bit', 'intelligence', 'one', 'more', 'interested', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'character', 'lesson', 'former', 'watch', 'scene', 'where', 'minister', 'good', 'decent', 'man', 'make', 'peace', 'Martians', 'surrounding', 'army', 'get', 'confirmation', 'invasion', 'not', 'visit', 'are', 'moments', 'unintentionally', 'mystify', 'such', 'how', 'mechanic', 'oblivous', 'WW', 'III', 'happening', 'couple', 'blocks', 'shop', 'Cruise', 'daughter', 'not', 'only', 'suddenly', 'losing', 'claustrophobia', 'actually', 'hiding', 'several', 'dark', 'enclosed', 'spaces', 'effort', 'protest', 'fact', 'aliens', 'have', 'engineered', 'complex', 'invasion', 'mastered', 'interstellar', 'space', 'travel', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'put', 'clothes', 'start', 'fireworks', 'why', 'army', ""n't"", 'just', 'blow', 'ground', 'rampaging', 'machines', 'instead', 'trying', 'attack', 'Sci-fi', 'used', 'be', 'smart', 'people.In', 'end', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'mostly', 'overhyped', 'underdeveloped', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'few', 'innovations', 'visual', 'audio', 'pyrotechnics', 'even', 'are', 'limited', 'film', 'big', 'battle', 'other', 'side', 'hill', 'characters', 'are', 'cardboard', 'story', 'virtually', 'nonexistent', 'product', 'placement', 'obvious', 'hey', 'what', 'market', 'nowadays', 'right', 'Spielberg', 'king', 'Hollywood', 'marketing', 'least', 'audiences', 'are', 'willing', 'shell', 'out', '[', ']', 'viewing', 'then', 'more', 'DVD', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'cameos', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'Ann', 'Robinson', 'stars', 'Pal', 'superior', '1953', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nicer', ""'d"", 'been', 'better', 'movie']",N/A
635563,A2PN62S0L13TD,B00005JNTI,"Stephen Norquist ""S. Norquist""","[7, 11]","I must admit to a high level of disappointment with this film. When you get people like Spielberg, Cruise and Fanning together in one film where the script is already present as a perfect book and a previous 1953 film showed exactly how a movie of this type should be done, how can you fail?Yet Spielberg found a way. I say the failure is Spielberg's because Tom and Dakota have extreme talent. Their talent was simply not utilized. What should have been a film of monumental horror, despair and hopelessness with the characters suffering this wide range of feelings that we could share in and identify with instead devolved into little more than a circus clown act of confusion.First off, there was no war of the worlds here. We never saw the massive, unparalleled battle of two worlds throwing everything they had at each other. We never saw humanity fail, humanity on the brink of extinction. We never saw the authorities despair. We never saw them drop their heads in utter resignation to the inevitable slaughter of all that we love.We never saw the great art and beauty of the world crushed under a cold unfeeling mechanical foot. We never saw the child we love, the woman we love, the husband we love vaporized in front of our eyes. We never saw everything that matters ripped from us and immolated in the furnace of a heat ray.The 1953 version of the film gave us all of that. At the end of the movie when the last of humanity is huddled together in a small church praying to a seemingly unhearing god to please save them, we see a heat ray shatter a beautiful stained glass window. At that moment we scream out ""No!"" We feel the uncaring of the aliens, the lack of mercy, the loss of everything.You see, Spielberg and Lucas have been directing special effects for so long that they forgot how to direct people. They think actors are just CG things. So we never can connect with this film. We really don't care about these unlikeable people.

Amazon was great,providing a substitute  DVD for another title and I picked this one up locally.No book reports of the story, characterizations or my opinions on anything other than the quality of the BluRay transfer itself.  I do have the standard DVD version and now the Blu Ray.If you don't or didn't like the movie, than don't buy it.  However, if you did like it, as I did, you must absolutely get War of the Worlds on Blu Ray.  This is a DEMO disc for your audio system for sure.  The transfer of the audio is DTSHD 5.1 and if the sound editors didn't get an Academy award for their work, they was robbed.  The audio is brilliant, it is the star of the Blu Ray world with huge, deep bass, fantastic use of the discreet channels of your home theater system and clear details throughout the audio range.  I am searching my head to find a better Blu Ray disc to demo a home theater system with and am coming up short.  There are plenty of Blu Rays with great audio, even more without, but none that I have found that surpass War of the Worlds.  If you find one with better audio, let me know.The video transfer is also very good.  I paused the disc in several places, especially dark scenes, to find any grain or artifacts and found none.  While the coloration will swing wildly from a greyed out scene here to a sharply colored scene there, all that you see is what the cinematographer planned for you to see. There are several scenes that do appear to be softly focused and might not be sharp enough for your expectations but, given the dusty calamity of the story line, my guess is that the soft focus was deliberate in post production.This is a demo disc for sure.There are plenty of extras with interviews of Steven Speilberg, Tom Cruise and others as well as a retrospective of the 1953 version I saw as a boy. There are no deleted scenes and the interactive menu was easy to navigate.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,War of the Worlds on BluRay,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,2329,"['Had', 'slight', 'problem', 'multiple', 'order', 'discs', 'one', 'was', 'missing', 'order', 'Amazon', 'was', 'great', 'providing', 'substitute', 'DVD', 'title', 'picked', 'one', 'up', 'locally.No', 'book', 'reports', 'story', 'characterizations', 'opinions', 'anything', 'other', 'quality', 'BluRay', 'transfer', 'do', 'have', 'standard', 'DVD', 'version', 'now', 'Blu', 'Ray.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'However', 'did', 'like', 'did', 'must', 'absolutely', 'get', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DEMO', 'disc', 'audio', 'system', 'sure', 'transfer', 'audio', 'DTSHD', '5.1', 'sound', 'editors', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Academy', 'award', 'work', 'was', 'robbed', 'audio', 'brilliant', 'star', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'world', 'huge', 'deep', 'bass', 'fantastic', 'use', 'discreet', 'channels', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'clear', 'details', 'audio', 'range', 'am', 'searching', 'head', 'find', 'better', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'demo', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'am', 'coming', 'up', 'short', 'are', 'plenty', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'great', 'audio', 'even', 'more', 'none', 'have', 'found', 'surpass', 'War', 'Worlds', 'find', 'one', 'better', 'audio', 'let', 'know.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'paused', 'disc', 'several', 'places', 'especially', 'dark', 'scenes', 'find', 'grain', 'artifacts', 'found', 'none', 'coloration', 'will', 'swing', 'wildly', 'greyed', 'out', 'scene', 'here', 'sharply', 'colored', 'scene', 'there', 'see', 'what', 'cinematographer', 'planned', 'see', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'do', 'appear', 'be', 'softly', 'focused', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'sharp', 'enough', 'expectations', 'given', 'dusty', 'calamity', 'story', 'line', 'guess', 'soft', 'focus', 'was', 'deliberate', 'post', 'production.This', 'demo', 'disc', 'sure.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'interviews', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'retrospective', '1953', 'version', 'saw', 'boy', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interactive', 'menu', 'was', 'easy', 'navigate.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A
635566,A1JJOV69MAU2J2,B00005JNTI,Steven Dennis,"[5, 7]","When you see the giant title 'War of the Worlds' and Steven Spielberg directs, you expect a certain kind of movie -- with auteur moments and touches, and major impact. Spielberg delivers two-thirds of a great movie, and then totally botches the ending.Perhaps after all the criticism of A.I.'s multiple endings, he decided that it would be better to have no real ending at all? It's deus machina taken to an anticlimactic extreme. I won't spoil it beyond saying you should have very low expectations for an ending, and you'll still be disappointed. It may be true to the book, but it just doesn't work for a big budget summer action movie called 'War of the Worlds'...The opening of the movie, by contrast, is compelling, and the movie is worth watching simply for the first contact and the initial terror that comes. Spielberg decided consciously to make a movie about how an alien invasion affects one family unit, rather than how it affects the planet. That's not such a bad idea, except that this family is so ridiculously screwed up in such a Hollywoody way. There's the bad ex-husband who doesn't know that his daughter is allergic to peanut butter, and the bratty teen kid who inexplicably would rather run off to see (fight? yeah right!) the aliens than help save his little sister, who is merely a shameless plot device (think the kids in Jurassic Park). The movie is at its best when the family is on the run and being hunted. It'll remind you of Jurassic Park and the velociraptors. In fact, Spielberg doesn't appear to have learned too many new tricks. Although there are a few big action scenes that will spark terror and wonder, teen girls in the seats behind me had to stifle laughter at some of the plot developments that were clearly not intended to be humorous.Also, unlike most other Spielberg works (but similar to A.I.), there is a depressing worldview and view of humans that pervades the whole movie -- that seems to emphasize the futility of humanity itself. That we fight and strive to be more than that in the face of futility has an admirable quality to it, and has a certain appeal, but is ultimately a bit of a bummer.In some ways, a movie about the rebuilding of the planet after the devastation would have been more interesting...",3,Flawed summer 'thriller',1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,2261,"['When', 'see', 'giant', 'title', ""'War"", 'Worlds', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'expect', 'certain', 'kind', 'movie', 'auteur', 'moments', 'touches', 'major', 'impact', 'Spielberg', 'two-thirds', 'great', 'movie', 'then', 'totally', 'ending.Perhaps', 'criticism', 'A.I', 'multiple', 'endings', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'have', 'real', 'ending', 'deus', 'machina', 'taken', 'anticlimactic', 'extreme', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'disappointed', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'book', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'big', 'budget', 'summer', 'action', 'movie', 'called', ""'War"", 'Worlds', 'opening', 'movie', 'contrast', 'compelling', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'simply', 'first', 'contact', 'initial', 'terror', 'Spielberg', 'decided', 'consciously', 'make', 'movie', 'how', 'alien', 'invasion', 'one', 'family', 'unit', 'rather', 'how', 'planet', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'idea', 'family', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'screwed', 'up', 'such', 'Hollywoody', 'way', 'bad', 'ex-husband', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'daughter', 'allergic', 'peanut', 'butter', 'bratty', 'teen', 'kid', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'would', 'rather', 'run', 'off', 'see', 'fight', 'yeah', 'right', 'aliens', 'help', 'save', 'little', 'sister', 'who', 'merely', 'shameless', 'plot', 'device', 'think', 'kids', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'family', 'run', 'being', 'hunted', ""'ll"", 'remind', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'velociraptors', 'fact', 'Spielberg', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'learned', 'too', 'many', 'new', 'tricks', 'are', 'few', 'big', 'action', 'scenes', 'will', 'spark', 'terror', 'wonder', 'teen', 'girls', 'seats', 'had', 'stifle', 'laughter', 'plot', 'developments', 'were', 'clearly', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'humorous.Also', 'most', 'other', 'Spielberg', 'works', 'similar', 'A.I', 'depressing', 'worldview', 'view', 'humans', 'pervades', 'whole', 'movie', 'emphasize', 'futility', 'humanity', 'fight', 'strive', 'be', 'more', 'face', 'futility', 'admirable', 'quality', 'certain', 'appeal', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'bummer.In', 'ways', 'movie', 'rebuilding', 'planet', 'devastation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting']",N/A

Wells' masterpiece by different fiilmmakers (In addition to the DVD rerelease of George Pal's classic 1953 film). Of the three, Steven Spielberg's ambitious adaptation is the one that has gotten the most attention.This adaptation has great action sequences that feature impressive visual effects. The alien tripods, as well as the aliens themselves, are startling to behold.Sadly, the main story of one man struggling to protect his family during the invasion is a bit drab. Tom Cruise does alright in the role, but none of the performances are really worth praising. The script has several exciting moments, but they are few and far between in an otherwise slow-moving sci-fi film. Also, John Williams' score is a bit of a let-down, almost mimiking James Newton Howard's brilliant score from ""Signs.""There are also a few lapses in common sense. All electrical devices (Cars, watches, lighting) goes out, but one man's camcorder still works. Also, how is it that the existence of the alien tripods were secretly buried underground without anyone finding them?Anyways, Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" is an epic film that will appeal to sci-fi/horror aficinados. But if you want to see a great adaptation of Wells' masterpiece, then I recommend two other films: George Pal's 1953 classic, and Timothy Hines' underrated ""H.G.

635568,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JNTI,Steven Reynolds,"[3, 4]","Adapting H. G. Wells' novel into a Hollywood movie is always going to be hard. We all know the story, for a start - or we should. Moreover, the book is an allegorical attack on the excesses of British imperialism, where plot is secondary to political intent. It's brutal, unsentimental, and it certainly doesn't follow the three-act pattern of heroic motivation that Hollywood movies require. Ultimately, the world is rescued by accident - microbes and our own white blood cells save the day - not the cleverness, pluck and heroics that are Hollywood's stock in trade. There's plenty of violent action, but the ""hero"" doesn't really do much except interpret it all through the lens of liberal philosophy. You can get away with that in a novel because it's a more ponderous form. But it's hardly the stuff of Hollywood sci-fi. Drop the reflective narration and what are you left with? A pretty thin script, that's what. Fortunately, the arc of the story is broad enough for Spielberg to plug the gaps with his favourite elements - a fractured family, gutsy kids, and gob-smacking CGI (ILM's best work in years). Friedman and Koepp's adaptation is also wisely loose enough to include some fine suspense sequences and some physical heroics from Cruise. It's all handled with the absolute technical mastery you expect from Spielberg and his usual crew. It's astonishingly realistic, and I don't just mean the CGI - the scenes of mass human panic are spot-on, and the performances from Cruise and the amazing Dakota Fanning are exceptional. But all this can't overcome the impediment of the wandering screenplay and utterly unmotivated ending - it might accurately capture the powerlessness of the characters, but for the audience it feels like a cheat, even when you know its coming. Not so in the novel which is less reliant on motivated action and where the philosophical themes are to the fore. So it might've been more effective if Spielberg had either: (a) ""metaphorized"" the microbes and made it not only about biology but also about finding ""the power of what's inside you"" in an emotional sense, i.e. your courage, your determination, your uniquely human will to overcome insurmountable odds.  He attempts this with the ""loser Dad finally has to take responsibility for his kids"" angle, but Cruise's star persona gets in the way; or (b) foregrounded the theme of imperialism, given that America now lives in fear of reprisals for its own. He gestures to the contemporary connection - ""Is it the terrorists?!"", a plane crash, and a dust-covered Cruise looking just like a 9/11 survivor - but he ultimately opts to make a darker version of the same popcorn movie he's made a dozen times before. ""Take one family, add a big scary threat, and top with a generous dash of syrup...""

Moreover, this is no faithful adaptation of the novel, which I have read; but why all movies that come from a novel MUST be ultra faithful screen versions of a novel? That would be always boring.The viewer should'nt try to descypher all the extraterrestials intentions and means of operating, they are just a misterious and formidable force from another planet that want OURS for THEM. Not only about this movie, but other SciFi, I read a lot of people complaining about 'Why This?' 'Why That?'. This is a 2 hour movie, not V The Final Battle nor Galactica,  that kind of criticism belongs more to the latter or Star Trek.As a disaster movie, this work is almost a masterpiece, the FX are superb, there is great tension and desperation always, you just try to imagine yourself in the characters' various situations of this alien invasion, and lets see if you would always make the right decisions...you will figure out, that THERE ARE NO RIGHT CHOICES in such an extreme and unbelievable situation, your life depends of some luck and to stay away as possible from the powers that be.As Science Fiction films are concerned, I avoid to compare remakes, specially if they are decades away (except if there is an obvious difference in quality, such as Planet of the Apes). 1953 The War of The Worlds is a work from another time, Spielberg's is a work of the 21st century that exploits 21st century's sensibilities, I do not see why that has to be negative.The ending is very similar from the novel, and it is a whole and HUGE point of the main story. Spielberg surely knew this and wisely avoided a more climatic final, those who want humans blasting off and wasting aliens should look away. A footnote: this ending is far more wise than, for example, Independence Day...my God, I still cannot make some text files compatible between my Mac and my Windows PC! You know what I mean...In a nutshell, of Spielberg's late SciFi works I prefer this one (the others being Minority Report and Artificial Intelligence) despite that in all of them you find masterful moments, this has the more thrills and surprises that are typical of his authoring.

Spielberg's take on H.G Wells classic, is indeed jam-packed with flaws from beginning to end, flaws that overshadow the expectedly impressive effects.Even if, in all fairness, the overwhleming mayhem and destruction that goes on in the first 40 minutes of the film is easily entertaining the eye, the story itself sinks swiftly from the many mistakes that are needlesly inserted in the script. A few examples:-alien technology supposedly freezes all electronic communications and functions on the planet, but oh, a miracle, a cell phone camera keeps working.-due to this, all cars become obsolete as well, but oh again, lo and behold, an ingenius mechanic at the right place at the right time, and totally acidentally, comes up with an amazing patent that keeps T.Cruise's mobile running smoothly.-aliens have machines buried for million of years ""watching us"" but then no explanation is given as to why they would wait so long to begin with.-While all major cities are going through surreal devestation, miraculously (again) Boston seems to be chilling out and enjoying a nice day in the sun.These are just a mere few, the rather bigger holes in the script. There are many more ""smaller"" ones, but not small enough to escape the eye of even the lazy viewer. They all contribute to take the sting out of the film in all the crucial moments throughout.It's not all bad of course. With a titanic budget at hand, Spielberg does deliver a visual catastrophe with few near equals in celluloid history. The ride is good enough while it lasts but it doesn't last long enough.But what would all this be without a few tons of syrup for good measure?The director spalshes it on late in the film, if ""late"" is an accurate term for the last full hour, but it comes tsunami-style. Bravery for idiots kicks in making the film look like a b-league comedy, family values straight from 50's-style stories take the front seat, and dodgy, flimsy characters all mix in to make this worse than it should've been.All this could've easily been avoided. None of the flaws are of the kind that is usually seen as an excuse for the sciptwriter: i.e ""he had to do this to make the rest of the story work"". No. It's just bad script-writting, period. Pity.

(Now is that a name for a band, or what?)In the original classic, we found out more and more about the aliens. How they destroyed, how their machines moved, how they were slowly taking over the Earth. The scientist and his girlfriend were compelling characters because you saw them struggling against the Martian horde. No relationship or family issues were dallied upon there.It is this reliance on family ""drama"" which nearly destroys this picture. I don't care about the fact that Tom Cruise is a negligent dad. Or that his oldest son hates him and wants to run away. Or that Dakota Fanning is so cute every time she screams that you can't help but smile. I wanted to see more of the machines and other people struggling to survive, not just the Cruise clan.As for the aliens, I resented them showing up in the basement because they came off as ET's cranky deformed relatives. Shown playing with a bicycle, among other things, they gave such an obvious nod to that whimsical movie that I winced. These aliens are supposed to be bad, black widowy monsters, man!

635581,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00005JNTI,Terry Mesnard,"[4, 8]","When Spielberg decided on remaking the classic War of the Worlds, he and screenwriter David Koep decided they didn't want to follow the sci fi aliens attack cliches (see Independence Day).  Instead, they wanted to go back to the source material and, with a few changes, make a movie that wasn't just about When Aliens Attack but was also about a man and his family.Spielberg gets right to the chase as well.  After a few brief scenes setting up the characters, he gives us a thrill ride that hardly lets up for the entire 117 minutes of the film.  Destruction after destruction, sometimes seen sometimes effectively not seen, fills the screen, hurding the characters toward their final goal.  It's a chase film, but one with a heart and with a genuinely good story.In fact, when Cruise and Fanning's characters finally get a moment to not run, the movie becomes a thriller of sorts, pitting them not only against curious aliens but also a truly weird character played by Tim Robbins.  His role here, like in Mystic River, is intense and deeply disturbing.The computer graphics Spielberg use prove that he is once again on top of his game.  I have never seen destruction so realistic in a movie.  And the aliens, for once, did not look like either animatronic puppets or bad CG that doesn't ""gel"" with the scene.  It was very effective.Another high point was how effectively Spielberg used post 9/11 fears to generate even more fear.  In a world of ""Orange"" alerts with terrorism, War of the Worlds create a high tension just like the novel and first movie did.  When War of the Worlds was written, it used the fear of industrialization that was ocurring to foster the fear.  And now, we have Fanning's character asking if it was the terrorists that were attacking.  Darkly funny perhaps, but also frightening that that is the thought we jump to today.A point of contention it seems for some goers is close to the end and the alien's defeat.  While it is true that it is anti-climatic as some professional reviewers have complained, it is how the novel ends.  If it didn't end this way, it wouldn't be true to the novel.  So, while I do think it can be considered anti-climatic, it's not a problem for me.  The biggest problem, in my opinion, was the classic sappy Spielberg ending after the climax.  The resolution just poured sappy Spielberg.  In some movies, it would be okay.

635583,A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ,B00005JNTI,the-gr8shag,"[3, 5]","Steven Spielberg & Tom Cruise team together again, this time bringing another version of H.G. Wells classic tale, ""War Of The Worlds"", to the big screen.Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a New Jersey dockloader, who is a single father of two & as the viewer finds out, is one part of a very dysfunctional family. Ray's oldest son can't stand him & doesn't talk to him unless both are in a heated argument. Ray's daughter is 9 going on 30. His ex-wife arrives to drop the kids off for the weekend & it's gonna be long one (she & her new husband are going to Upstate N.Y. to her parents for the weekend).The weekend takes a turn towards the end of the world, when Ray wakes up to find his cherished Ford Mustang missing (his son took it for a joyride, to get back at him for whatever), his daughter ordered take-out and it's crap food, & then comes the heat lightning thats not an isolated incident & looks as if it's not naturally made.Upon further investigation, Ray & his fellow townsfolk discover that the door to the end of the world has opened as an alien invasion has begun four blocks from where Ray's apartment is. Huge tripod, monsterous ships crash upwards thru the ground destroying all life in their destructive path. The aliens are here for one purpose - total extermination of the humanrace, & to suck all the planet's resources dry until the planet is nothing but a piece of rock orbiting a dead sun.Ray grabs the kids & fights his way to Upstate N.Y. in hopes of finding the mother of his children, hopefully alive & riding out the storm of alien destruction.When I look at the film resume of Steven Spielberg, I see two phases of his career.The first is the undeniable punch that Spielberg gave the film industry in the 70's & 80's. Films such as ""Jaws"", ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"", ""E.T."", ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"", ""Indiana Jones & The Temple Of Doom"" & ""Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade"" are textbook examples. I, daresay, that even his obnoxious film ""1941"" was funny (yeah, I'm one of the few who liked it).The second phase began in 1991 & goes right into the new millenium (right up to ""War Of The Worlds""). For the Christmas Season of 1991, Spielberg released ""Hook"". That film wasn't bad, but, it wasn't Spielberg, either. ""Hook"" was this big saccarine sweet filled movie, that was so sweet, you immediately made an appointment to see your dentist after the film.Since then, Spielberg hasn't really had the drive & punch he had that was in his earlier films, his first phase.""Jurassic Park"", great film , but, essentially ""Jaws"" on land.""Schindler's List"", landmark film that reminds us the horror of WWII. Well deserved Oscar for Spielberg (finally!). Spielberg had always tried to break away from his trademark fare & try serious filmmaking & gets it here. One of his best (but, most of his film's are).Both films were released in 1993. After that Spielberg went on to start the Shoah Foundation, & is one of the founding father's of ""Dreamworks SKG Studios"". Then came two more lackluster films, ""Amistad"" in 1996 & ""The Lost World"" in 1997.In 1998, Spielberg released the classic, ""Saving Private Ryan"", a look at WWII from the eyes of the American Soldier. Like ""Schindler"" this is a must see. James Doohan, (Scotty from ""Star Trek""!), wrote a letter to Spielberg telling him the film was so realistic that the only things missing from the film was the stench of death & the choking, acrid black smoke that filled the air from all the crossfire. In otherwords, another director Oscar for Spielberg.This leads to Spielberg's last five films, ""A.I.- Artificial Intelligance"", ""Minority Report"", ""Catch Me If You Can"", ""The Terminal"" & ""War Of The Worlds"".""A.I"" Spielberg directed after his good friend & fellow director Stanley Kubrick passed away. It was Kubrick's latest project & Spielberg felt to honor his passing by picking up where Kubrick left off on the project. The movie is o.k., but, quite sad.""Minority Report"" was the first teaming with Tom Cruise. The film is based on a story Philip K. Dick.""Catch Me If You Can"" is the first Spielberg comedy since ""1941"" & is a breezy film based on a true story.""The Terminal"" is the third film that Spielberg & Tom Hanks have done together & the weakest of three. Its o.k.As for ""War Of The Worlds"", Spielberg's fingerprints are all over this film. Its a sinister film that actually tests the limits of it's PG-13 rating. It's the heavy metal version of Steven Spielberg.A lot of images from this film remind me of previous Spielberg films. The instant cremation of the humans from the alien deathray reminds me of the climax to ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"".The alienship cruising, & then breaking the surface of the water to attack a boatload of people screams ""Jaws"".The alienship ""roar"" it gives off before attacking is similar to the call the velociraptors use in ""Jurassic Park"". The people fleeing in terror once the attack begins, as well as, a quiet scene where people are all walking to an unknown destination is disturbingly similar to ""Schindler's List"".Is ""War"" a good film? yes.Is it one of Steven Spielberg's best films? If you think of his other bigger films, the word is a resounding ""no"".Is it worth getting on DVD (tentative release is November 22nd)? Yup (it is a Steven Spielberg film, hello!).With all that aside, ""War Of The Worlds"" is a movie thats worth invading your time.",4,"Another ""Worlds""",1125273600,"08 29, 2005",2005,5376,"['Steven',

localized to the quadstate area(ny,nj,mass,and conn).anyway,up pops this tripod and all heck ensues.it turns humans to dust.hhhmmm,if these were the best way superior beings can think of to take over earth,its very clucky at best.and a side note to those buried tripods....it seems they were here before WE were....uuuummmmm......why did they have to be buried?did the aliens know that earth would be inhabited by weak humans and waited for us to arrive before claiming earth for their own?!?!?!?!?and you never get the idea that earth was trying too hard to defend earth either.more on that later.ok,theres 100 movies worth of running and yelling(you can thank dakota for the yelling portions).lucky for ray that aliens cant out think him.he manages to jump start a mini van when no one else can.they drive and bicker and run and cry and drive and argue and.....you get the point.the next significant part is when family ferrier meet up with tim robbins charactor.he is a nut case but a helpful one.they huddle in his basement minus the boy....he ran off to get a better view of the clunky tripods.more on him later.ray repays tim by either thrashing him or downright offing him.tim was drawing too much attention to their hideout.this was the worst seeking mission ive ever seen superior beings carry out.stair cases and wooden beams blocked their body heat radar thiggamajig AND their probe got beat up by an axe!!!we get a glimps of the aliens.nothing about this movie is great or mind blowing.so far,its a complete dud.ok,more running,yelling,crying,chasing,running......back to the son.on attempt # 150,he succeeds at running away.ray had to pick between son and daughter who was in the midst of being snatched by a couple of humans.at this point ray is snatched up into this cage with other humans.1 by 1,a human is sucked into a tube just to be liquified.now its rays turn.now all of the other captives feels its time to help one an other!''we cant let them get ray!!!''turns out ray found some grenades and as he got sucked up,he released them and was saved by the humans pulling.its gets lamer!!!!the grenades detonate and that cage is freed.WOOHOO!!!and guess what....the movie ends.sorta.the aliens manage to be weaker than us humans and die.ray goes to his ex's home where no alien set foot and find that the son made it!!!!then we get the reasoning for the aliens demise....they couldnt handle our bacteria.or some similar nonsense.a two day war.for those giving this 2 or more stars,they probably gave gigli 7!!!!!!!!!!!!this makes independence day seem

Sounds fun right?.Well it only makes for an  average movie experience with many plot holes and lots of well just lots of mess.On the first day of this ""Extermination"" The townspeople start hearing lighting striking, and striking and striking and striking and striking, 26 times to be exact.And When the people investigate this striking they see that only one spot in this road was struck by the lighting.....scarrrryy huh?Then a large Tri-Pod Robot comes out of the ground and starts vaporizing everyone with everyone running from it like its a scene from Godzilla.I can picture the people saying ""AHHHH ITS............ITS.....A LARGE TRI POD!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHH""Its funny because the humans don't really know what they are running from but since its shooting lasers giving everyone a free cremation they guess it's bad.Now the acting in this movie is very good, Dakota fanning was a little annoying in the beginning with her ""child brat antics"" but she starts to love her dad during their adventure trying to stay alive. While The son wants to fufill his civic duty during the worst time you would want to.Also i know steven spielberg directed this movie but he couldn't resist bringing back the scene from jurassic park when the two kids are avoiding the raptors in the kitchen but instead with tom cruise and CO. and a large eye tenticle.I kind of got that yeah it was scary back in 1993 but wake up steve its 2005! its not anymore! maybe my eight year old sister was scared but not any adult! unless your a chicken.To be honest i was more scared of the traumatizing images instead of the scenes of horror and death.As for the ending, it feels like it was just so rushed and no thought whatsoever put into it and so Cliche'.So In conclusion This movie does not live up to the hype(well atleast not in my book)but it's an average movie and you will have an average time watching it, unless you love ailiens and earth destruction.PROS+good acting+good special effectsCons-Bad Plot-suspenseful moments fall flat-Cliche' EndingOverall-3 stars out of 5",3,Another Overhyped Summer Blockbuster.But Watchable.,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,2666,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'start', 'THE', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'come', 'movie', 'title', 'be', 'caps', 'exclamation', 'points.Lets', 'just', 'start', 'plot', 'really', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie.Hollywood', 'Superstar', 'Tom', 'jump', 'sofa', 'Cruise', 'deadbeat', 'dad', 'who', 'get', 'respect', 'son', 'daughter', 'Child', 'Superstar', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'days', 'take', 'care', 'divorced', 'wife', 'only', 'assuming', 'weekend', 'child', 'duties', 'care', 'A', 'Global', 'Extermination', 'Conducted', 'Ailiens', 'who', 'are', 'hell', 'bent', 'taking', 'over', 'earth', 'fun', 'right', '.Well', 'only', 'average', 'movie', 'experience', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'lots', 'well', 'just', 'lots', 'mess.On', 'first', 'day', 'Extermination', 'townspeople', 'start', 'hearing', 'lighting', 'striking', 'striking', 'striking', 'striking', 'striking', '26', 'times', 'be', 'exact.And', 'When', 'people', 'investigate', 'striking', 'see', 'only', 'one', 'spot', 'road', 'was', 'struck', 'lighting', 'huh', 'Then', 'large', 'Tri-Pod', 'Robot', 'ground', 'vaporizing', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'running', 'scene', 'Godzilla.I', 'can', 'picture', 'people', 'saying', 'AHHHH', 'ITS', 'ITS', '..A', 'LARGE', 'TRI', 'POD', 'AHHHHHHHHHHHH', 'funny', 'humans', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'running', 'shooting', 'lasers', 'giving', 'everyone', 'free', 'cremation', 'guess', 'acting', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'Dakota', 'fanning', 'was', 'little', 'annoying', 'beginning', 'child', 'brat', 'antics', 'love', 'dad', 'adventure', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'son', 'fufill', 'civic', 'duty', 'worst', 'time', 'would', 'want', 'to.Also', 'i', 'know', 'steven', 'spielberg', 'directed', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'bringing', 'back', 'scene', 'jurassic', 'park', 'when', 'two', 'kids', 'are', 'avoiding', 'raptors', 'kitchen', 'instead', 'tom', 'cruise', 'CO.', 'large', 'eye', 'tenticle.I', 'kind', 'got', 'yeah', 'was', 'scary', 'back', '1993', 'wake', 'up', 'steve', '2005', 'not', 'anymore', 'maybe', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'sister', 'was', 'scared', 'not', 'adult', 'chicken.To', 'be', 'honest', 'i', 'was', 'more', 'scared', 'traumatizing', 'images', 'instead', 'scenes', 'horror', 'death.As', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'rushed', 'thought', 'whatsoever', 'put', 'so', ""Cliche'.So"", 'conclusion', 'movie', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'well', 'atleast', 'not', 'book', 'average', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'average', 'time', 'watching', 'love', 'ailiens', 'earth', 'destruction.PROS+good', 'acting+good', 'special', 'effectsCons-Bad', 'Plot-suspenseful', 'moments', 'fall', 'flat-Cliche', 'EndingOverall-3', 'stars', '5']",N/A
635590,A3NQSMTG612AF,B00005JNTI,TheTruthHurts,"[1, 1]","2.5 StarsDude...this movie was like, so awesome, man... (Removing crayon from brain) Wait a minute...IQ rising...OK, back to reality. This film, which I graciously assign 2.5 stars, is mostly flat-out boring, extremely dumbed-down for the masses, and simply not in the same league as Spielberg's previous efforts (minus an occasional stinker, e.g. A.I.). Actually, I would place this film only one notch above this year's other cgi-swamped mess, ""Revenge of the Sith;"" there is simply no reason, aside from a few half-way exciting scenes, to watch this film. The characters are flat and uninteresting; Cruise is simply not believable as the working-class hero, Fanning overacts as usual, and there is very little development. In short, we don't care about what happens to them. Additionally, can you point me in the direction of one scene that is truly engaging? I think not. The film pales in comparison to the original (believe it or not), and is worth a mere rental only, unless you have some strange desire to see what has become the lesser half of TomKat in action more than once...who would have thought that between this film and Independence Day (which is very similar), the latter would be the more enthralling one to watch (and disturbingly, the more logical of the two)? ""War of the Worlds"" might be okay with the aid of a lobotomy (or a crayon in the brain); as long as you don't give the film an ounce of thought, it might be watchable. However, it doesn't take a director as talented as Spielberg to produce such a standard-fare action film, and I've seen drying paint that offered more entertainment value than this picture; call me crazy, but even in dumb action movies, there should be something that provokes a brain cell or two (e.g., ""The Matrix""). And then there's the ending...where to begin? SPOILER: In typical Spielberg fashion (of late...allow me to revert to A.I. again), we get the standard happy ending that defies the nature, intent, and conviction of the film. As soon as the son returned, I knew what I'd suspected all along: that this picture really is on Independence Day's level. In short, yet another disappointing 2005 Hollywood spectacle, and one of Spielberg's worst. When Cruise and Spielberg, the biggest actor and director in Hollywood, respectively, can no longer make a film worth watching, can one conclude that Hollywood as we know it has, as the human race should have done in this film, come to an end?And another note; in Australia (this is regarding another viewer's ""review""), is there something that is causing blurred vision in your water? The transfer quality of this DVD (region 1 (I have early access to DVD releases)) is atrocious! Maybe your region's is better, somehow? It's nearly as grainy as a VHS tape (though, given the now standard Spielberg digitally-dulled and grained film appearance, it's probably intentional...but it looks awful).",3,Another Spielberg failure made only to generate revenue...,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,2901,"['2.5', 'StarsDude', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'awesome', 'man', 'Removing', 'crayon', 'brain', 'Wait', 'minute', 'IQ', 'rising', 'OK', 'back', 'reality', 'film', 'graciously', 'assign', '2.5', 'stars', 'mostly', 'flat-out', 'boring', 'extremely', 'dumbed-down', 'masses', 'simply', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Spielberg', 'previous', 'efforts', 'occasional', 'stinker', 'e.g', 'A.I.', 'Actually', 'would', 'place', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'notch', 'year', 'other', 'cgi-swamped', 'mess', 'Revenge', 'Sith', 'simply', 'reason', 'aside', 'few', 'half-way', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'watch', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'uninteresting', 'Cruise', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'working-class', 'hero', 'Fanning', 'overacts', 'usual', 'very', 'little', 'development', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'Additionally', 'can', 'point', 'direction', 'one', 'scene', 'truly', 'engaging', 'think', 'not', 'film', 'pales', 'comparison', 'original', 'believe', 'not', 'mere', 'rental', 'only', 'have', 'strange', 'desire', 'see', 'what', 'become', 'lesser', 'half', 'TomKat', 'action', 'more', 'once', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'film', 'Independence', 'Day', 'very', 'similar', 'latter', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'enthralling', 'one', 'watch', 'disturbingly', 'more', 'logical', 'two', 'War', 'Worlds', 'might', 'be', 'okay', 'aid', 'lobotomy', 'crayon', 'brain', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'ounce', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'watchable', 'However', ""n't"", 'take', 'director', 'as', 'talented', 'Spielberg', 'produce', 'such', 'standard-fare', 'action', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'drying', 'paint', 'offered', 'more', 'entertainment', 'value', 'picture', 'call', 'crazy', 'even', 'dumb', 'action', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'brain', 'cell', 'two', 'e.g.', 'Matrix', 'then', 'ending', 'where', 'begin', 'SPOILER', 'typical', 'Spielberg', 'fashion', 'late', 'allow', 'revert', 'A.I', 'again', 'get', 'standard', 'happy', 'ending', 'nature', 'intent', 'conviction', 'film', 'As', 'soon', 'son', 'returned', 'knew', 'what', ""'d"", 'suspected', 'picture', 'really', 'Independence', 'Day', 'level', 'short', 'yet', 'disappointing', '2005', 'Hollywood', 'spectacle', 'one', 'Spielberg', 'worst', 'When', 'Cruise', 'Spielberg', 'biggest', 'actor', 'director', 'Hollywood', 'respectively', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'can', 'one', 'conclude', 'Hollywood', 'know', 'human', 'race', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'come', 'end', 'note', 'Australia', 'regarding', 'viewer', 'review', 'there', 'something', 'causing', 'blurred', 'vision', 'water', 'transfer', 'quality', 'DVD', 'region', '1', 'have', 'early', 'access', 'DVD', 'releases', 'atrocious', 'Maybe', 'region', 'better', 'somehow', 'nearly', 'as', 'grainy', 'VHS', 'tape', 'given', 'now', 'standard', 'Spielberg', 'digitally-dulled', 'grained', 'film', 'appearance', 'probably', 'intentional', 'awful']",N/A

""War of the Worlds"", the modern, glorified special-effects revival of H.G. Well's 1950's novel is not one of these films.  A cross between ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", this end-of-the-world fantasy starring the ""Oprah""-show chair-hopping psycho Tom Cruise and the extremely talented Dakota Fanning shows true promise, but eventually implodes and becomes another unbelievable, run-of-the-mill alien epics that truly has no soul.Cruise stars as Ray Ferrier, a divorced blue-collar man who is notoriously disorganized, irresponsible, and does not possess the ability to maintain a well-balanced life.  His children, daughter Rachel (Fanning) and troubled teenager Robbie (Justin Chatwin) are staying at his home for the weekend, yet he has no idea how to take care of them or connect with this children on any level.  Just as Ray feels as though his life is spiraling out of control, strange clouds and lightning begin to envelope the sky.  Ray jumps out into the streets to investigate, only to view a massive, human-destroying alien come up from beneath the streets and proceed to disintegrate humans left and right.  The Ferriers soon learn that this is not an isolated occurrence in their small town, but that all the major cities across the world are getting demolished by these horrific extra-terrestrial machines.  As the family attempts to steer away from the evil aliens, Ray learns about his true responsibility to his family and the love that come from it.Spielberg uses his usual ""Jaws"" formula to set the stage, bringing the aliens to the scream with discreet measure, ultimately exploring the notion that the aliens are using the humans of earth to revamp the entire planet for alien inhabitance.  Cruise is only adequate as the lead character, playing a mediocre, usual role that plays stale to the rest of the ensemble cast.  Fanning steals the show as the precocious young daughter, while Tim Robbins is wasted as a psychotic army veteran in hiding.  What makes ""The War of the Worlds"" most disappointing, yet ironic if you have knowledge of the original H.G. Well's story, is that the film fails to create a feasible, logical resolution.  Spielberg appears to have put to much effort creating the alien monsters and enticing Cruise to star in another one of his films instead of acting reading the script for which he is supposed to direct.  Special effects wizardry at is finest, yet that's about all that is grand about this complete hoax of a blockbuster.",2,The War of the Worlds  (2005),1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2958,"['Director', 'Steven', 'SpielbergCast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Rick', 'Gonzalez', 'Yul', 'Vasquez.Running', 'Time', '116', 'minutes.Rated', 'PG-13', 'science-fiction', 'violence', 'thematic', 'events', 'language.Once', 'time', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'used', 'create', 'mesmerizing', 'motion', 'pictures', 'strike', 'childhood', 'chord', 'souls', 'transplant', 'everyday', 'experiences', 'bring', 'world', 'astonishment', 'hope', 'War', 'Worlds', 'modern', 'glorified', 'special-effects', 'revival', 'H.G', 'Well', '1950', 'novel', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'cross', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'end-of-the-world', 'fantasy', 'starring', 'Oprah', '-show', 'chair-hopping', 'psycho', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'true', 'promise', 'eventually', 'implodes', 'unbelievable', 'run-of-the-mill', 'alien', 'epics', 'truly', 'soul.Cruise', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'divorced', 'blue-collar', 'man', 'who', 'notoriously', 'disorganized', 'irresponsible', 'not', 'possess', 'ability', 'maintain', 'well-balanced', 'life', 'children', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'Fanning', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'Robbie', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'are', 'staying', 'home', 'weekend', 'yet', 'idea', 'how', 'take', 'care', 'connect', 'children', 'level', 'Just', 'Ray', 'life', 'spiraling', 'control', 'strange', 'clouds', 'lightning', 'begin', 'envelope', 'sky', 'Ray', 'out', 'streets', 'investigate', 'only', 'view', 'massive', 'human-destroying', 'alien', 'come', 'up', 'streets', 'proceed', 'disintegrate', 'humans', 'left', 'right', 'Ferriers', 'soon', 'learn', 'not', 'isolated', 'occurrence', 'small', 'town', 'major', 'cities', 'world', 'are', 'getting', 'demolished', 'horrific', 'extra-terrestrial', 'machines', 'family', 'steer', 'away', 'evil', 'aliens', 'Ray', 'true', 'responsibility', 'family', 'love', 'come', 'it.Spielberg', 'uses', 'usual', 'Jaws', 'formula', 'set', 'stage', 'bringing', 'aliens', 'scream', 'discreet', 'measure', 'ultimately', 'exploring', 'notion', 'aliens', 'are', 'using', 'humans', 'earth', 'revamp', 'entire', 'planet', 'alien', 'inhabitance', 'Cruise', 'only', 'adequate', 'lead', 'character', 'playing', 'mediocre', 'usual', 'role', 'stale', 'rest', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Fanning', 'steals', 'show', 'precocious', 'young', 'daughter', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'wasted', 'psychotic', 'army', 'veteran', 'hiding', 'What', 'War', 'Worlds', 'most', 'disappointing', 'yet', 'ironic', 'have', 'knowledge', 'original', 'H.G', 'Well', 'story', 'film', 'create', 'feasible', 'logical', 'resolution', 'Spielberg', 'have', 'put', 'much', 'effort', 'creating', 'alien', 'monsters', 'enticing', 'Cruise', 'star', 'one', 'films', 'instead', 'acting', 'reading', 'script', 'supposed', 'direct', 'Special', 'effects', 'wizardry', 'finest', 'grand', 'complete', 'hoax', 'blockbuster']",N/A
635592,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B00005JNTI,Thomas Glebe,"[6, 10]","I remember awhile back, when I first heard that Steven Spielberg was going to do a remake (or new version) of one of my favorite books and movie versions of all time.  While I can hardly remember reading the book and its details and differences, I do remember it firing my imagination as a youth.  In that youth, I also remember the brilliant, though campy at times, special effects, adventure, and genuine excellence of the 1953 version, and the latter has always been one of my all time favorite sci-fi films, long past, or near future.I wondered long before this hit theaters, let alone DVD, why exactly Steven Spielberg was trying to make a better, let alone updated movie version when the 50's one is near about perfect?  Why remake, in any form, or however different, an almost flawless previous version?  Could Steven pull it off, if anyone?  Could over 50 years passing advances in CGI and special effects, possibly be better than the original movie?  The answers, for the most part, are no.Spielberg hasn't made a decent sci-fi/fantasy picture since ""Jurassic Park, "" in my view, and the things I did not like about his ""AI"" and ""Minority Report"" efforts, are all over this, and make the film more of a glimpse into what special effects (and great music by John Williams as always) can come up with, than a compelling film experience.  Or any type of validation of Steven as one capable of making a decent sci-fi/fantasy anymore, without super budgets which, for all the eye candy this version offers at times, is hollow and very slow at times.  And which, in the final analysis, pales in comparison to the 50's movie.In the 1953 version, the story and characters were all rather simplified compared to the book, but it was all told in a purely linear and easily understandable way.  It immediately started and continued without any of the unnecessary fanfare and pretty much useless character development seen in this version.  The original was years/decades ahead of its time. This version seems contrived and confusing in many parts and seems to lay an uncomfortable, temporal ""post 9-11"" paranoia upon the whole, which detracts from what made the book so memorable, and takes a lot of the pure ""fun"" out of the first and only truly great movie version.In the 50's flick, we are well into the story very quickly.  In Spielberg's version, extreme concentration is first put into getting to know divorced, blue-collar Tom Cruise's life and quirks, as well as that of introducing us to his situation in life and his relationship with his ex-wife (and boyfriend), his kids (who he just so happens to have custody over ""for the weekend"" when the aliens decide to arise and attack), and it really just drags and isn't believable.  Cruise's character from the start just seems so carefree and irresponsible, that it makes one almost not really care whether he's victorious in the end or not.  And his kids at the very beginning seem unlikely to recognize his authority, let alone his capability to lead them through an alien invasion nightmare.  In short, before ANY special effects of note appear, the movie has already dragged and we wind up impatient for the expensive CGI.While some of the computer generated imagery is indeed outstanding, it lacks imagination, and a lot of it seems to be shot in black and white or faded color, unlike the original, which if nothing else was and remains one the most colorful and beautiful films ever.  Spielberg has used this ""technique"" before, especially in ""AI"" and ""Minority Report"" as well as ""Schindler's List,"" but it just doesn't work here.  One wonders by the end whether this was intentional or not, but with all the reported money spent on this, I would've loved to see a FULL-COLOR version.  This is drab in comparison to the original movie version, and I really don't understand this ""technique"" when so overdone.  Any film technique as such, witness Spielberg's over-indulgence with the shaky, cinema-verite in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" shouldn't occur throughout a movie, because it eventually grows tiresome to the viewer, and is unnecessary.I guess it's just impossible for someone like me who enjoyed the 50's version so much, to approach this with anything less than disappointment. This is much more like the Mel Gibson film, ""Signs"" than it is anything else, and sacrifices possibly awe-inspiring direction and special effects for just too much character development for characters in this which we really never care about.  It more resembles a ""horror"" film than anything truly sci-fi, and every time we really want to SEE the alien ships and the aliens themselves, we are left with B&W; or faded color, dark and very slow-paced scenes concentrating on an uninteresting side-story to what the whole world is going through.A lot of the effects are first-rate, and you can see where a lot of the money went in creating this, but again, why not just go for broke and utilize COLOR film?  Why the constantly annoying, needless dull images which begin to take the characteristics of gimmicky filmmaking, than anything approaching artistic license?  Why concentrate so much of the movie to the purely personal experiences of one person, and his bratty son and (constantly screaming) daughter, when this is ""WAR OF THE WORLDS?!""Some of the greater, global effects of the alien invasion are dealt with later, but the film's major flaw is setting up most of the movie as more about Tom Cruise's character and kids, as rather isolated examples, even though we see countless others vaporized by the ET.  And Cruise's character is never really all that believable, let alone one which we can truly root for in the end.  In the 50's version, we actually see ""the planet"" trying to take on these nasty folks from outer space, in various scenes involving infantry, guns, tanks, and jets, and eventually the dropping of ""the bomb.""  Here, almost none of that is shown, except on the side, and Cruise eventually seems to succeed with a simple hand grenade in liberating his daughter from abduction/captivity.  What happened to the BOMB?  None of this is mentioned, even though if this is supposed to take place in more modern times, the world has a 1000 times more firepower.This is a half-decent movie over all, but is too inconsistent and focuses on the wrong people, places, and things throughout.  While I have seen the great original 50's version dozens of times (and I suggest y'all buy THAT instead of this), this just isn't interesting enough for that type of loyalty and repeated, often repeated viewings.  There are some really good parts in this movie, but overall, it never rises anywhere close to the quality and originality and execution of the 1953 version.  And even the good parts of Spielberg's version make one wonder really, where did all the budget go to anyway?Ah yes, the director's pockets most likely.  Disappointly seeming more of a vanity project from a multi-multi millionaire who has seeming lost his ability to really challenge and enchant (see Close Encounters, ET, or the already mentioned Jurassic Park), like with ""AI"" and ""Minority Report,"" this is another Spielberg sci-fi/fantasy flick gone bad.  Not that it's all that bad.  It has its moments.  But while the original threw us right into the action and adventure from the beginning to the end, this version should've been re-written and re-filmed into something a lot more compelling, especially considering the 50 plus year gap between the classic and this misfire.Unless you haven't seen the original (also available on DVD and a much wiser buy), or are a Spielberg fanatic or collector, this is a rental at best.  If you love it and are blown away, go ahead and dole out the cash, but I can hardly imagine anyone loving this in the first place, as it is contrived and uninvolving mostly throughout.  And the special effects are more ""disaster"" movie kind and dark and faded, when they needn't have been.  This DVD version also has virtually no extras, when they could've easily included a LOT.Guess all that was saved for some ""special collectors edition"" or something, where Steven could pocket a few more bucks, but the movie itself should be the star of any DVD, and the film just doesn't add up to something one would want to watch repeatedly.  Let alone shell out money for desperately needed, almost non-existent extras, deleted scenes, etc.Another curious sci-fi/fantasy misfire for the most part, from a director who seems to have lost his touch in the genre, for a long time.  The music and a few scattered special effects save this in the end from just being really bad, but it could've been a lot better with a bit more forethought as to story, characters, and filmic techniques.  And the 50's version was and remains the definitive and by far the best rendering of the novel, this a distant and for the most part unenjoyable remake.",3,"Good, but doesn't come close to the 50's

635594,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JNTI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[14, 19]","Spielberg is one of a handful of directors who love to make films. You may ask yourself: Don't all directors love to make films? Yes, I think most of them get into the business because they love the magic of the movies, but at some point, fame and money and power take hold and they start to make sequels, remakes, poorly conceived star vehicles, etc. Spielberg has made his share of sequels, but even these films show his enthusiasm, his love of film. As a director, he has been involved in some of the most successful films ever made. With each new film, he adds a skill or learns how to create more intriguing drama or suspense. Just about every film is better than the last. ""The Color Purple"" is very moving, but ""Schindler's List"" is devastating. ""Jaws"" is suspenseful and frightening, but ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a roller coaster ride. ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" is great, but ""E.T."" is a classic. With a small number of missteps along the way, Spielberg has learned to blend of his love of the magic of film with a very accomplished skills, a skill matched by few of his contemporaries.""War of the Worlds"", starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, blends the best elements of Spielberg's best films into a cohesive, scary, thrilling, suspenseful summer blockbuster. And it's a darn good ride.Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), a dockworker in New Jersey, rushes home to meet his ex-wife and their two kids, Robbie (Justin Chatwin, who bears a remarkable resemblance to Cruise) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning). Ray's kids share a strained relationship with their undependable father; they clearly don't like spending time in Ray's cramped, dirty, poorly stocked apartment. Catching a little sleep, Ray awakes to find Rachel has ordered healthy take-out (his refrigerator is bare) and Robbie has taken a joy ride in Ray's beloved restored Mustang. Noticing a strange storm behind the house, Ray and Rachel join their neighbors outside to watch. The sky is filled with a large, dark circling cloud and Ray realizes that all of the wind is blowing towards the clouds. Soon, lightning repeatedly strikes one spot a couple of blocks away and this renders all electronics powerless and all cars are out of commission. Ray and a number of locals find the spot where the lightning hit and soon the ground begins to rumble.The original story was written by H.G. Wells in 1898 (which is pretty amazing, if you stop to think about it) and was made into a memorable radio broadcast by Orson Welles in 1938. The radio broadcast was so scary, so believable, people actually thought we were being invaded. In 1953, the story was turned into a film starring Gene Barry, who makes a cameo in the new version. I have never seen the 1953 film, but I imagine the narrative in the 2005 version is quite different. In ""Worlds"", Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp center the action on Ray and his two kids. Everything they see and experience is what we see and experience. This helps to make the film personal; we identify with Ray and his kids and feel concerned for their safety. When they are in danger, the film is supsenseful. We want them to make it out safely. When they are in danger, the film is scary. As they journey through a changing landscape, we make the journey with them. This helps to give the film a soul and heart that most summer blockbusters don't have.Spielberg has always been at the top of his game when it comes to films with a lot of special effects. He and George Lucas practically invented the modern era of special effects (some people would like to vilify them for this). In ""Worlds"", there are certainly a lot of special effects and CGI work, but the work is so seamless, and blended with the live action so well, it appears to be real. Often, a filmmaker will use every trick in his book, just because they can (I'm looking at you George Lucas and ""Star Wars I, II and III"") and the human element is completely disregarded. In ""Worlds"", the special effects make the human element all the more real. Because Ray actually appears to be running from large alien ships, we are rooting for him to be successful. A lot of money and time was spent on the effects work for this film and it shows. Everything blends together realistically.Another key indication of Spielberg's achievement is that not all scenes are dependent on special effects for their success. Much like in ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters"", we don't get a good look at the aliens until far into the story. Sometimes, they are surrounded by clouds and lightning, others, we see them in a fleeting reflection. Isn't it more suspenseful when you don't immediately see the entire alien? Or monster, in the case of a horror film? The best directors know this which is why the best examples of these genres don't give us a look at the shark or the aliens until late in the film. Later in ""Worlds"", we already believe the aliens are trying to take over, so we don't need to see them in every scene. A particularly suspenseful scene involves Ray and Olgivy (Tim Robbins) as they play a game of cat and mouse with each other and some alien foot soldiers.Tom Cruise has definitely become one of our finer actors. His silly appearances on recent talk shows aside, he is an accomplished actor and he has been making some bold decisions lately in the projects he works on. ""Collateral"" was a bold choice for the megastar. Playing a hit man roaming the streets of Los Angeles is not normally a role we would expect to see Cruise play. He took the role and did a great job in it. ""Worlds"" is a safer bet for him. Spielberg + Cruise + Aliens and special effects = summer blockbuster and studio green light, but the actor brings much more depth to the character than we might expect. He is a father with flaws and problems and doesn't have a great relationship with his kids. In most summer films, we would see a few minutes of this type of character, to ""establish it"" and then the action kicks into gear and all character nuances are forgotten. In ""Worlds"", Ray's flaws carry through. He grows in believable, small and acceptable ways. ""Worlds"" is not Cruise's best work, but for a summer blockbuster it is surprisingly good.Dakota Fanning plays Rachel, Ray's daughter. Is Fanning the reincarnation of some great actress from the golden age of Hollywood? This little girl is a great actress. In most of her films, she brings an amazing range of emotion to the role. ""Worlds"" is no exception. In one scene, she is being carried by her Dad, watching the action behind them, horror registering on her face. We don't see what she is witnessing, we only watch the horror in her eyes. It is truly mesmerizing to watch such a young girl deliver such a convincing performance.Spielberg has created a real roller coaster ride of a film. He has taken the thrills of the ""Indiana Jones"" films and married them with acting on the par of ""The Color Purple"" and added special effects that would rival ""Close Encounters"" or ""A.I."". This mix has created one of the best summer blockbusters I have seen in some time.",5,Spielberg's Summer Blockbuster Is A Darn Good Film,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,7064,"['Spielberg', 'one',

It is one of his greatest works to date.I also enjoyed the performance by Tom Cruise, who sunk into his role and executed it greatly as a father who is trying to make ends meet, all while working through the pains of divorce.  Cruise seems to step into the role in such a way that you don't notice that it is Cruise on the screen in front of you, a trait that actors tend to leave out in lesser movies.The casting is tremendous!  I was enthralled to learn that one of my favorites, Tim Robbins, was to have a secondary role in the movie.  He does a fantastic job at portraying his role, and shows why he has received high acclaim in the industry.The technical effects are awe-inspiring, but keep the look and feel needed to bring the original story to life.  Technicals and ""new-age"" science are kept out of the story, which adds a personal and human touch to the film.  I like the perspective of trying to save humanity, and not how badly the white house gets blown up.  (I think we've seen enough of that in real life to last). Rather, we return to true heroics - ie, keeping family alive, and realizing the worth of souls, no matter who they are.The artistic touches are apparent in every frame of the movie, and as Speilberg relates, were carefully considered to create the proper mood and reality necessary to carry the movie plot.  To add to the artisms are ILM and their neverending ability to amaze the mind, and John Williams, who's music is both slightly disturbing and completely driving of the intensity; a William's field of expertise.If anything, this film returns the story to it's original version, and is not a remake of a movie, but more a retelling of the epic that is ""War of the Worlds"".

The Mercury Theatre radio production (with Orson Welles) is a historical landmark, and the original film with Gene Barry was pretty good. So, maybe let it be, huh, Steve?Tom Cruise has to be one of the most promoted creatures in history. He was a nonactor who, I must admit, got better. (I understand Jack Nicholson gave him lots of useful tips in ""A Few Good Men."" I could usually tolerate him after that.)But, well, first, as an actor buddy pointed out, Cruise doesn't make it as a container crane operator. No, Tommy. Blue collar you are not.The special effects started out okay, I guess. I'm not sure they made all that much sense but they kept my eyes on the screen, despite Tom's lack of credibility, again, as blue collar. The incredible got too much to take when Tommy's running from the machines used by the alien invaders. Everyone--EVERYONE--but him is being hit by their rays. Sure, there's ""license of the medium."" But it was too much to take.It sort of reminded me of a scene in ""MI2"" when cruise was getting away from a thousand machine gunners. It bordered on the comical.The rest of the film was the sloppiest I've ever seen. The machines themselves were inconsistent. It's like Spielberg had ideas that he put together without reconciling with what had gone on before, or maybe he just had different set-toys to play with, I don't know.Then there was the annoying drone, the bass tone stolen directly from ""Close Encounters."" C'mon Steve. Use some new ideas, huh?I hoped I'd find something better in the additional DVD, with commentaries and all, but, no, it didn't make the film any better.I'll admit it: I've seen it twice so far. If you're much of a film buff, you'll find it a let down. If you want to keep your kids--the ones too young to remember the Pal production particularly--occupied, then I suppose it's okay.If Spielberg does any more remakes, I hope he puts lots more thought into it, and doesn't just make another promotional vehicle for Tom Cruise.",2,Another promo for Tommy...,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,2079,"['many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'H.G', 'Welles', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'film', 'was', 'work', 'art', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', 'radio', 'production', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'historical', 'landmark', 'original', 'film', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'So', 'maybe', 'let', 'be', 'huh', 'Steve', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'promoted', 'creatures', 'history', 'was', 'nonactor', 'who', 'must', 'admit', 'got', 'better', 'understand', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'gave', 'lots', 'useful', 'tips', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'could', 'usually', 'tolerate', 'well', 'first', 'actor', 'buddy', 'pointed', 'out', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'make', 'container', 'crane', 'operator', 'No', 'Tommy', 'Blue', 'collar', 'are', 'not.The', 'special', 'effects', 'started', 'out', 'okay', 'guess', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'made', 'much', 'sense', 'kept', 'eyes', 'screen', 'Tom', 'lack', 'credibility', 'again', 'blue', 'collar', 'incredible', 'got', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'when', 'Tommy', 'running', 'machines', 'used', 'alien', 'invaders', 'Everyone', 'EVERYONE', 'being', 'hit', 'rays', 'Sure', 'license', 'medium', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'take.It', 'sort', 'reminded', 'scene', 'MI2', 'when', 'cruise', 'was', 'getting', 'away', 'thousand', 'machine', 'gunners', 'bordered', 'comical.The', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'sloppiest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'machines', 'were', 'inconsistent', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'ideas', 'put', 'together', 'reconciling', 'what', 'had', 'gone', 'maybe', 'just', 'had', 'different', 'set-toys', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Then', 'was', 'annoying', 'drone', 'bass', 'tone', 'stolen', 'directly', 'Close', 'Encounters', ""C'mon"", 'Steve', 'Use', 'new', 'ideas', 'huh', 'hoped', ""'d"", 'find', 'something', 'better', 'additional', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'better.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'so', 'far', ""'re"", 'much', 'film', 'buff', ""'ll"", 'find', 'let', 'down', 'want', 'keep', 'kids', 'ones', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'Pal', 'production', 'particularly', 'occupied', 'then', 'suppose', 'okay.If', 'Spielberg', 'more', 'remakes', 'hope', 'lots', 'more', 'thought', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'promotional', 'vehicle', 'Tom', 'Cruise']",N/A

They are out there, its just that the suits in Hollywood don't thnk those ideas will sell tickets. So what we get is an unending deluge of remakes of old movies and 'reinterpretations' of old TV shows. The same things are happening in music today: A large percentage of 'new' songs are just remakes of old hits.First off, the 1953 version is a FAR better movie. While it may have strayed a bit from Wells' novel, its a great movie. The same cannot be said for this new version. To start with, the plotting is insipid, and there are several holes in the storyline big enough to drive a truck through. Namely, the explanation of how the aliens arrived on earth and why blood is being sprayed (or even involved). I won't go into detail so as to spoil the plot, but these two points alone make this a rather poor movie. In addition, the classic ending of the novel and the 1953 version is utilized, but NEVER EXPLAINED! I guess Speilberg just assumes everyone knows how the book ends. If you don't know how War Of The Worlds ends, you are going to be VERY confused at the end of this new version. There are several other problems with the script that I can't get into without spoilers, so suffice it to say that whoever wrote the script should be unemployed in Hollywood.The special effects are pretty spectacular, as expected. This movie is a great case in illustrating that great special effects DO NOT make a great movie. Despite the effects, this movie is not very good. The character development is quite appalling as well, since I found myself actually hoping the main cast would be killed, thats how unlikable the characters come off.All in all, this remake should NOT have been made. FANTASTIC special effects, but very unlikable character development and bad scripting makes this one a 2 star movie.

Cruise stars as Ray Ferrier, a divorced dockworker and less-than-perfect father. After his ex-wife and her new husband drop off his teenage son Robbie and young daughter Rachel for a rare weekend visit, a powerful lightning storm touches down. Later at an intersection near his house, Ray witnesses a towering three-legged war machine emerge from the earth and, before anyone can react, incinerates everything in sight. Don't you just hate it when an ordinary day suddenly becomes the first strike of an alien attack on Earth? Ray gathers up his family and they run, but of course, no matter where they run to, danger isn't to far behind. There is no safety, no refuge except Ray's will to protect the ones he loves.The film sags in the middle and starts to get repetitive, partly because it sees everything through the eyes of only three major characters, but boosts the story's psychological impact it does.

635603,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B00005JNTI,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[5, 7]","Movie - 4.5I've been a fan of Spielberg for as long as I can remember. I may not have been directly conscious of it growing up as a little kid when watching Jaws, E.T., all the Indiana Jones movies, Jurassic Park, or even Hook. But knowing what I do now, I can confidently say I'm starting to see him for the great film-maker he is. And with this being the second Tom Cruise/BD-release tie-in with Minority Report, I'm going to be keeping a lot of the technical similarities of the review between this and Minority. As for War of the Worlds, much like my experience with Minority, I never got around to seeing it in theaters and was thoroughly surprised when I actually got around to watching it. I also just recently watched 2012, something similar to War in terms of scope, but not nearly as in-depth and character-detailed. While 2012 certainly has the visual aspects down, I really wanted the movie to be more than just eye candy. Ultimately, although the characters in 2012 have some semblances of empathy, I feel the movie lacks in emotion overall and never really displays that true sense of despair, suspense, or horror -- characteristics I think an Apocalyptic film would possess. In War, I was completely blown away by its sheer simplicity and terror. 9/11 and political undertones aside, I see this film as being much more profound in that while it also has an advanced visual flair, it also manages to tell a very well-paced and engrossing kind of thriller. Sure it may be an alien invasion movie, a concept tried and dried through various mediums since the Cold War, but to see it produced with a combination of such glamorous effects and taut screenplay, I'm amazed at how well it presents itself. In contrast to 2012, it excels thematically in every way showing things like humanity, or the lack thereof when desperation to survive or the duty to protect takes over, the sacredness of life, preservation of innocence, and many other themes I'd rather not spoil. It was, for me, a very surprising piece of sci-fi horror that was downright spooky at some points with just enough grit, action, and story/characters that managed to enlighten, as well as entertain.Video - 5.0Much like Minority Report, Paramount does an outstanding job preserving the work of Janusz Kaminski. To be blunt, there's grain, and lots of it, but intentionally so for cinematic effect and a kind of ""vintage"" look. For the type of film it is, colors aren't really drab, per se, but are uniquely ""alien"" in that their variations range from darker to lighter primaries with a hint of ""metal"" to them. It's something of a chromatic progression that evolves with the narrative and displays itself accordingly. Black levels are deep with no signs of crush and make for some particularly tense moments like when the tripods attack or when the characters are hiding from the aliens in the basement. And contrast is also excellent with only one or two instances of that Bleach Bypass technique, which never really distracted me in Minority, but those who don't like it will be happy to know it's not nearly as prevalent in this film. Overall, image quality is sharp with only a few tiny instances of debris that are hardly noticeable and presents itself well with a mix between gritty, throwback, and bleak photography with no kind of image manipulation whatsoever. Kudos to the people at Paramount.Audio - 5.0Also like Minority Report, War of the Worlds boasts an equally buoyant and reference-level DTS-HD track. It doesn't take long before the opening credits and narration of Morgan Freeman for the audience to sample just a taste of things to come via the music of John Williams, which, for me personally, gives the film half its aesthetic value. And I have to say for a man who only saw half of the movie before making a full score, Williams never ceases to amaze with his musical intuition and mastery of the craft. Sound effects-wise, we're introduced to some thunderous LFEs during a lightning storm after which the sound scape literally explodes off screen when the aliens start to attack from their tripods. A small earthquake, crumbling buildings, shattered glass, and various noises of destruction and mayhem flood the speakers in every direction. Dialogue remains clear throughout said chaos and shows no distortion during quieter moments. Separation is perfectly placed from the rears and does an excellent job of panning when needed, while high and low ends cover the spectrum in the form of mechanical whirring down to the sound of small handgun fire. This is alien invasion at its finest.Extras - 4.0The special features here cover a lot of areas, though largely from a production standpoint. The 80-minute diary and musical composition pieces are what I found to be most interesting. A lot of work went into the making of the film, and this really raised my appreciation for it as a whole. Things like set design, stunt coordination, special/visual effects, cinematography, etc. are talked about. A little bit of the story's history and its origins are mentioned as well, along with what Spielberg wanted to do with it in terms of modern-day conveyance. Altogether, it amounts to almost two and a half hours and does a really good job, though doesn't feel nearly as deep as the extras found on Minority. No spiffy retrospectives were added, and the teaser trailer is the only HD extra, which is a bit of a shame considering how much I really like the movie. I'm also bummed that there's no commentary or at least some kind of introduction by Spielberg himself, though I'm still hopeful to hear one by him at some point.Overall - 4.5War of the World really caught me by surprise. It's a very well-written story with little bits of disaster, sci-fi, and horror all rolled into one with brilliant execution thanks in part to its simplicity of screenplay, excellent effects, and a great cast.

635604,AB4WQ9HGVCCD,B00005JNTI,"Tony Rome ""mine is fine as wine and I should ...","[1, 1]","One Saturday afternoon in 1953, when I was seven, my father took me to an afternoon matinee of a film called ""Invaders From Mars""The film terrified me and kept me up for nights (years later, when I became interested in moviemaking, I found some of the childhood fear had to do with the way Director William Cameron Menzies, on a shoestring budget, shot the film influenced by the German Impressionists giving it a creepy, off kilter look and feel).What got to me most as a 7 year old, however, was due directly to the fact that the Martian invasion was seen though the eyes of the little boy (Jimmy Hunt) who was ""Invaders' main centerpiece.After seeing Steven Spielberg's new version of H.G. Welles ""War Of The Worlds,"" I would lay money that Spielberg shared the same fears I did after seeing ""Invaders"" as a kid--similarities abound; from the impressionistic way the film is shot by Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (a piece of brilliant filmmaking) to David Koepp's screenplay which keeps the film strictly told through the eyes of its main protagonist, Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), crane operator professionally and deadbeat dad personally.Speilberg and Koepp wisely avoid the all the cliches of alien movies of the past--no important monuments are shown geeting zapped---crowds of millions aren't annhiliated by death rays--there is no showdown at dawn with the military emerging victorious-- (in other words, ""Worlds"" is 'light years' away from the cartoon stupidity of ""Independence Day"").Tom Cruise is in just about every scene and he gives a sensational performance (his tearful rendering of ""Little Deuce Coupe"" to his daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) is a standout.As for Miss Fanning--she is a prodigy--a little girl with the grace and naturalism of Meryl Streep.What can you say about the ILM special effects wizards?The opening phases of the invasion (numerous lighting strikes, followed by concrete gutters and sidewalks erupting) is beyond mesmerizing.But Speilberg uses the effects more as a backdrop to the human interest story of Ferrier and his family--making them all the more effective--there is little doubt that much of the opening sequence conciously harks back to the horrors of 9/11 from Dakota Fanning shouting ""Is Is Terrorists!?"" as buildings crumble,to the posters of missing loved ones strewn along the sides of buildings and newsstands.Few films in recent memory have received the pre release hype of ""War Of The Worlds,"" most of which stemmed from Cruise's relationship with Katie Holmes and his recent rantings about the evils of psychiatry on the Today show).Paramount and Dreamworks asked critics not to publish any reviews until the film was released--generally a sure sign of impending disaster.With that in mind I went to see ""Worlds"" expecting bitter dissapointment....Didn't happen--it's a terrific film!",5,"""When

Secondly, how in the world did Cruise's son, who barely avoids death because of stupidity, manage (SPOILER SPOILER) to beat his father and sister to Boston, on his own?3.)

635611,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNTI,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","Instead of adding another summery of the famous H.G.Wells novella (which many of the previous reviewers had done well), I'd like to point out several things about Steven Spielberg's visually stunning 'War of the World.'  The CGIs and sound effects are great, but as far as the story goes, it needs much re-writes.1) This film is often very scary, so parents should be warned if they bring pre-teen kids to theater.  The state-of-the-art CGI techniques are all fantastic -- see the breathtaking sequences in which a huge tripod appears from the ground -- but the director (who won Oscar for 'Saving Private Ryan') often uses them to scare you.  The carnage by the alien's tripods is sometimes graphic, and the suggested nature of the scarlet-colored ivy-like plants is disturbing.2) The story may not what you want to see in this kind of summer-season blockbuster films.  It's not 'Independence Day' where Bill Pullman's president of United States fights back, literally, against the big UFO (and I like that film).  Everything is shot from the viewpoint of terrified Tom Cruise (a dock yard worker) and his children Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin.  In short, they run, run, and run.  At first, it is thrilling, but when they encounter Tim Robbins in a deserted farmhouse, things get boring, and Fanning, though a good actor, screams too much, which I found slightly irritating.3) About the ending, of course, I shouldn't tell you this except that even with Morgan Freeman's sublime narration (from the book itself), it is a disappointment.  I'm not taling about the results of the 'War' which is, I think, a fairly well-known one.  I'm talking about the very melodramatic part, which I think is unnecessary and awfully sugary.  Why did HE come back anyway?4) As you will notice, Spielberg borrowed many elements from the past films -- see a bicycle in the basement, for instance -- and that's OK with me.  But not this one, many references to the 9/11 tradegy -- see the film's geographical setting (in NEw York), many photos posted looking for the missing people, Tom Cruise's clothes covered with ash, and bits of clothe slowing falling from the sky as if dancing, and Dakota Fanning repeatedly yelling about terrorism -- all these things are clearly pointing to that day.  It is explotation, worst kind of it, and I cannot find the reasons they should be included.My verdict, therefore, is three stars, which means, good visuals and great sound effects, but the contents are too dismal and ultimately empty.See for the cameo of Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, the stars of the 1953 version of 'War of the Worlds' which remains the definite version of this H.G.Wells classic.",3,"Visually Stunning, But The Contents Are Dismal and Empty",1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,2677,"['Instead', 'adding', 'summery', 'famous', 'H.G.Wells', 'novella', 'many', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'had', 'done', 'well', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'several', 'things', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'visually', 'stunning', ""'War"", 'World', 'CGIs', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'much', 're-writes.1', 'film', 'often', 'very', 'scary', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'bring', 'pre-teen', 'kids', 'theater', 'state-of-the-art', 'CGI', 'techniques', 'are', 'fantastic', 'see', 'breathtaking', 'sequences', 'huge', 'tripod', 'ground', 'director', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', ""'Saving"", 'Private', 'Ryan', 'often', 'scare', 'carnage', 'alien', 'tripods', 'sometimes', 'graphic', 'suggested', 'nature', 'scarlet-colored', 'ivy-like', 'plants', 'disturbing.2', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'kind', 'summer-season', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'not', ""'Independence"", 'Day', 'where', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'fights', 'back', 'literally', 'big', 'UFO', 'like', 'film', 'Everything', 'shot', 'viewpoint', 'terrified', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'dock', 'yard', 'worker', 'children', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'short', 'run', 'run', 'run', 'first', 'thrilling', 'when', 'encounter', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'deserted', 'farmhouse', 'things', 'get', 'boring', 'Fanning', 'good', 'actor', 'screams', 'too', 'much', 'found', 'slightly', 'irritating.3', 'ending', 'course', 'should', ""n't"", 'tell', 'even', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'sublime', 'narration', 'book', 'disappointment', ""'m"", 'not', 'taling', 'results', ""'War"", 'think', 'fairly', 'well-known', 'one', ""'m"", 'talking', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'part', 'think', 'unnecessary', 'awfully', 'sugary', 'Why', 'did', 'HE', 'come', 'back', 'anyway', '4', 'will', 'notice', 'Spielberg', 'borrowed', 'many', 'elements', 'past', 'films', 'see', 'bicycle', 'basement', 'instance', 'OK', 'not', 'one', 'many', 'references', '9/11', 'tradegy', 'see', 'film', 'geographical', 'setting', 'NEw', 'York', 'many', 'photos', 'posted', 'looking', 'missing', 'people', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'clothes', 'covered', 'ash', 'bits', 'clothe', 'slowing', 'falling', 'sky', 'dancing', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'repeatedly', 'yelling', 'terrorism', 'things', 'are', 'clearly', 'pointing', 'day', 'explotation', 'worst', 'kind', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'reasons', 'should', 'be', 'included.My', 'verdict', 'therefore', 'three', 'stars', 'good', 'visuals', 'great', 'sound', 'effects', 'contents', 'are', 'too', 'dismal', 'ultimately', 'empty.See', 'cameo', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'Ann', 'Robinson', 'stars', '1953', 'version', ""'War"", 'Worlds', 'definite', 'version', 'H.G.Wells', 'classic']",N/A

635614,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JNTI,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[6, 8]","WAR OF THE WORLDS was one of the few movies I definitely wanted to see during the summer of 2005. I was really looking forward to it. Having heard Stephen Speilberg comment over and over again how he would never make a ""bad alien"" movie, I was more than curious to see how his adaptation of the really first ""bad alien"" story would turn out.  I guess I had my expectations set too high because I was disappointed.The film starts off promising enough. Spielberg updates Wells' classic sci-fi story by having the main action revolve around a single-bum of a father and his two children. Tom Cruise is really a terrible actor, but in all honesty is performance in WAR OF THE WORLDS as Ray Ferrier is one of his best. Dakota Fanning plays his daughter Rachel and is brilliant as always, while Justin Chatwin kind of gets screwed playing the unnecessary role of Robbie Ferrier. Basically, Ray's wife drops the kids off at Dad's while she and the new hubby are supposed to have some alone time. Ray's not to happy about the whole thing and since he's such a crappy Dad it's kind of easy to see why (he had party plans of his own). Then the sky starts to literally open up. Not long after, the ground rips open and the tripods come. They start vaporizing people all over the place. Ray runs away and makes it home, gets his kids, and drives off. By that time the invasion is in full force. The film then follows Ray as he and his family move from one location to the next, from his wife's home to trying to out chase the monsters on a ferry, to hiding from them in a basement.Spielberg does a great job of melding Wells' original novel to the famous 1953 version of the story. There are all sorts of allusions to that film: from the basement scene to the arm that falls out of the crashed alien tripod. The acting is decent and the film moves at a great pace.Yet, despite all of this, the movie falls apart 2/3rds of the way through. Instead of taking a page from suspense master Hitchcock, Spielberg copies the teen-scream movies of blood and guts and tries to horrify the audience through gore. Though this element is an important part of the plot, it could have been told in a much better fashion. Also, the entire basement scene runs way too long, not to mention that the audience actually gets to see the aliens, they look more like the creatures from INDEPENDENCE DAY rather than something original. Spielberg originally wanted to make the movie around 1996, but when INDEPENDENCE DAY came out he thought better to wait so, perhaps the aliens are just a nod to ID-4. Whatever the case, the appearance of the aliens actually slows the film down, rather than build the tension up.These flaws would normally be minor, but for some reason in WAR OF THE WORLDS the take so much away from the film, that it never does quite recover. Instead of being joyed that the protagonists arrive at a safe location, by the end of the film, one wants to root for the aliens to win and just blow the whole planet up.",3,"Good, But Not Good Enough.",1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,2996,"['WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'definitely', 'wanted', 'see', 'summer', '2005', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'Having', 'heard', 'Stephen', 'Speilberg', 'comment', 'over', 'again', 'how', 'would', 'never', 'make', 'bad', 'alien', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'adaptation', 'really', 'first', 'bad', 'alien', 'story', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'guess', 'had', 'expectations', 'set', 'too', 'high', 'was', 'disappointed.The', 'film', 'promising', 'enough', 'Spielberg', 'Wells', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'having', 'main', 'action', 'revolve', 'single-bum', 'father', 'two', 'children', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'really', 'terrible', 'actor', 'honesty', 'performance', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'Ray', 'Ferrier', 'one', 'best', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'brilliant', 'always', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'kind', 'screwed', 'playing', 'unnecessary', 'role', 'Robbie', 'Ferrier', 'Basically', 'Ray', 'wife', 'kids', 'off', 'Dad', 'new', 'hubby', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'alone', 'time', 'Ray', 'not', 'happy', 'whole', 'thing', 'such', 'crappy', 'Dad', 'kind', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'had', 'party', 'plans', 'own', 'Then', 'sky', 'literally', 'open', 'up', 'Not', 'long', 'ground', 'open', 'tripods', 'come', 'start', 'vaporizing', 'people', 'place', 'Ray', 'away', 'home', 'kids', 'off', 'time', 'invasion', 'full', 'force', 'film', 'then', 'Ray', 'family', 'move', 'one', 'location', 'next', 'wife', 'home', 'trying', 'chase', 'monsters', 'ferry', 'hiding', 'basement.Spielberg', 'great', 'job', 'melding', 'Wells', 'original', 'novel', 'famous', '1953', 'version', 'story', 'are', 'sorts', 'allusions', 'film', 'basement', 'scene', 'arm', 'crashed', 'alien', 'tripod', 'acting', 'decent', 'film', 'moves', 'great', 'pace.Yet', 'movie', 'apart', '2/3rds', 'way', 'Instead', 'taking', 'page', 'suspense', 'master', 'Hitchcock', 'Spielberg', 'teen-scream', 'movies', 'blood', 'guts', 'tries', 'horrify', 'audience', 'gore', 'element', 'important', 'part', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'much', 'better', 'fashion', 'Also', 'entire', 'basement', 'scene', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'mention', 'audience', 'actually', 'see', 'aliens', 'look', 'more', 'creatures', 'INDEPENDENCE', 'DAY', 'rather', 'something', 'original', 'Spielberg', 'originally', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', '1996', 'when', 'INDEPENDENCE', 'DAY', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'better', 'wait', 'so', 'perhaps', 'aliens', 'are', 'just', 'nod', 'ID-4', 'case', 'appearance', 'aliens', 'actually', 'film', 'down', 'rather', 'build', 'tension', 'up.These', 'flaws', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'minor', 'reason', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'take', 'so', 'much', 'away', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'recover', 'Instead', 'being', 'joyed', 'protagonists', 'arrive', 'safe', 'location', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'root', 'aliens', 'win', 'just', 'blow', 'whole', 'planet', 'up']",N/A

It pays homage to the 1950s movie George Pal made from the book by including cameos by stars Gene Barry and Anne Robinson. And it casts Tom Cruise against type as an uncaring dad opposite a most unusual leading lady, the 11-year-old Dakota Fanning, who holds her own against the star wattage. It also completes director Steven Spielberg's trilogy about the space visitors seen in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""ET: The Extra-Terrestrial,"" although here they are far from benign.His remake ends the way Wells' novel and Pal's picture do, but everything else has been updated. Unlike the others, there is virtually no world view of the alien invasion. It is the script's conceit that we experience only what Cruise, his daughter and teenage son experience as they flee New Jersey. Spielberg shows us the panic of the populace and the chaos of our response to attack, giving his film post 9/11 relevance and elevating a mere thriller to something more disturbing, especially in post-Katrina America. Some have called this a horror movie, but it is that only in the horror we are asked to contemplate.Rewatching ""War of the Worlds"" on this two-disc DVD renews our amazement at how its set-pieces are constructed. The opening, when the aliens disrupt a Hoboken intersection, is heart-pounding; Cruise runs through the streets as they erupt, sending cars flying and buildings crashing around him. The capsizing ferryboat sequence is a text exercise in crowd management and seamless CGI. A spooky Tim Robbins appears in a basement interlude, much like the scary kitchen pursuit in ""Jurassic Park."" The DVD extras explain how all this was created.

635622,A1C80B497LCYKA,B00005JNTI,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[6, 7]","When I was an adolescent, I was a huge H. G. Wells fan. I loved his imagination, as well as his academic precision. Not only was he a fiction writer, he was a scientist, an historian, a sociologist and a teacher. Along with Jules Verne, he is known as the Father of Science Fiction.The War Of The Worlds is one of four of his books that are considered masterpieces and have been made into films. (The others are The Time Machine, The Invisible Man and The First Men In The Moon.) The War Of The Worlds gained tremendous fame when Orson Wells made it into a radio drama in 1938, and, because he presented it as a series of news flashes, many people thought we were actually under attack by Martians and panicked. It is today the most famous radio program ever produced, and, even though he was consider irresponsible, launched Orson Wells' career.In 1953, producer George Pal - who was given the rights by the Wells estate to produce all his novels - director Byron Haskin and writer Barre Lyndon adapted The War Of The Worlds to film. It starred Gene Barry. It is interesting for a number of reason. For one, Barry is wonderful as scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester, who investigates the first landing of Martians while on a fishing trip near the town of Pine Summit. For another, the story has been contemporized, with 1950's Los Angeles substituting for 1890's London. Another change is with the invaders and their machines: the 50's fascination with television makes the Martians almost organic TV cameras, and their machines Art Modern sculptures that float above the earth. And finally, there is a strong Christian theme that didn't exist in the original work.In 2005, there were three version of The War Of The Worlds released on film, and all three in the month of June: Stephen Spielberg's version starring Tom Cruise; Timothy Hine's verson, which, though faithful to Well's story and time period, was an abysmal failure; and David Michael Latt's version, which, like Spielberg's, is set in the present day and, like Hine's, is low-budget and a failure at both the box office and among critics. So, after Pal's 1953 film, only Spielberg's version is worth considering.I think Spielberg has a lot of the feel of Wells' story, especially in how the machines look and how the creatures ""harvest"" people for food; but it lacks the human element. I really thought Cruise's character was going to hook up with his ex-wife (Miranda Otto) and her boyfriend (David Alan Basche), and that together they were going to have an interesting triangular relationship as they tried to escape the invaders; but that didn't happen. The ex-wife and boyfriend appear at the beginning and then disappear until the end.I didn't like the relationship between Cruise and his two kids (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin). Tim Robbins was interesting as a whacked-out survivor-in-hiding, and it was nice to see Gene Barry and Ann Robinson make re-appearances from the 1953 film as the grandfather and grandmother. Overall the film is lackluster and ends on a note of despair, rather than hope as the 1953 version does. The 1953 version is still the best filmed version of this classic, and that is not saying a lot. We still need a strong version that is set in the 1890's like the novel. It is interesting that when George Pal produced The Time Machine in 1960, he did use Wells' 1890's setting, and it is a vast improvement over his War Of The Worlds.Waitsel Smith",3,"INTERESTING, BUT FAILS ON HUMAN LEVEL",1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,3444,"['When', 'was', 'adolescent', 'was', 'huge', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'fan', 'loved', 'imagination', 'as', 'well', 'academic', 'precision', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'fiction', 'writer', 'was', 'scientist', 'historian', 'sociologist', 'teacher', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'known', 'Father', 'Science', 'Fiction.The', 'War', 'Worlds', 'one', 'four', 'books', 'are', 'considered', 'masterpieces', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'films', 'others', 'are', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'First', 'Men', 'Moon', 'War', 'Worlds', 'gained', 'tremendous', 'fame', 'when', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'made', 'radio', 'drama', '1938', 'presented', 'series', 'news', 'flashes', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'actually', 'attack', 'Martians', 'panicked', 'today', 'most', 'famous', 'radio', 'program', 'ever', 'produced', 'even', 'was', 'consider', 'irresponsible', 'launched', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'career.In', '1953', 'producer', 'George', 'Pal', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'rights', 'Wells', 'estate', 'produce', 'novels', 'director', 'Byron', 'Haskin', 'writer', 'Barre', 'Lyndon', 'adapted', 'War', 'Worlds', 'film', 'starred', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'interesting', 'number', 'reason', 'one', 'Barry', 'wonderful', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Clayton', 'Forrester', 'who', 'first', 'landing', 'Martians', 'fishing', 'trip', 'town', 'Pine', 'Summit', 'story', 'been', 'contemporized', '1950', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'substituting', '1890', 'London', 'change', 'invaders', 'machines', '50', 'fascination', 'television', 'Martians', 'almost', 'organic', 'TV', 'cameras', 'machines', 'Art', 'Modern', 'float', 'earth', 'finally', 'strong', 'Christian', 'theme', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'original', 'work.In', '2005', 'were', 'three', 'version', 'War', 'Worlds', 'released', 'film', 'three', 'month', 'June', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'version', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Timothy', 'Hine', 'verson', 'though', 'faithful', 'Well', 'story', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'abysmal', 'failure', 'David', 'Michael', 'Latt', 'version', 'Spielberg', 'set', 'present', 'day', 'Hine', 'low-budget', 'failure', 'box', 'office', 'critics', 'So', 'Pal', '1953', 'film', 'only', 'Spielberg', 'version', 'worth', 'considering.I', 'think', 'Spielberg', 'lot', 'feel', 'Wells', 'story', 'especially', 'how', 'machines', 'look', 'how', 'creatures', 'harvest', 'people', 'food', 'human', 'element', 'really', 'thought', 'Cruise', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'hook', 'up', 'ex-wife', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'boyfriend', 'David', 'Alan', 'Basche', 'together', 'were', 'going', 'have', 'interesting', 'triangular', 'relationship', 'tried', 'escape', 'invaders', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'ex-wife', 'boyfriend', 'appear', 'beginning', 'then', 'disappear', 'end.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'relationship', 'Cruise', 'two', 'kids', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Justin', 'Chatwin', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'was', 'interesting', 'whacked-out', 'survivor-in-hiding', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'Ann', 'Robinson', 'make', 're-appearances', '1953', 'film', 'grandfather', 'grandmother', 'film', 'lackluster', 'note', 'despair', 'rather', 'hope', '1953', 'version', '1953', 'version', 'still', 'best', 'filmed', 'version', 'classic', 'not', 'saying', 'lot', 'still', 'need', 'strong', 'version', 'set', '1890', 'novel', 'interesting', 'when', 'George', 'Pal', 'produced', 'Time', 'Machine', '1960', 'did', 'use', 'Wells', '1890', 'setting', 'vast', 'improvement', 'War', 'Worlds.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A

(the drivers were thoughtful enough to give him enough space before their cars konked out with zero warning)  more eardrum piercing as people try to take the carThey lose the car, flee through the fields, flee in a ferry, hide in a farmhouse all interspersed with the little girl getting the devil scared out of her which prompts more screaming: Dakota Fanning sure can scream.(Truly great drama throughout, I was like ""i hope they make it!!! PLEASE don't let little DAKOTA get SUCKED UP into the SLIMY BOWELS of a TRIPOD where here screams would be forever silenced)Oh yeah, the rebel boy decides he ""must"" go and fight the machines because i think he finally found a cause he can believe in which is hand to hand combat with 500 foot high alien machines with deadly red lasers. I SWEAR I COULDN'T EVEN TELL IT WAS A SPECIAL EFFECT, I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE REAL LASERS! Spielberg is like michael jordan with a mouse (pen is another story).And don't forget they have been planning this for thousands of years because they were planted ""before hand"" see.. get it?..that was the genius of the aliens, because they could just pop up and surprise attack the suburban Boston area...no you don't understand, they are must more highly advanced than we are, but they decided to pick us off one by one with laser zappers because there's more sport in it than using nukes.I'm trying to remember how this gem ended, i might have fallen asleep in the theatre soon after I lost my hearing due to the damage my eardrums suffered.....thanks dakota.Now I remember, it was a HAPPY ending because the rebel boy really didnt die and he hugged his dad at the end, so don't worry about the millions who died, because they werent the main characters. (same as in Day after TommorrowBasically, by the end I was rooting for the aliens, and i think most people in the theatre felt this way.

635624,A1Y8FBJLVK6LS9,B00005JNTI,Wayne A.,"[5, 9]","I was genuinely stunned by this movie. Few friends of mine who are serious film people went to see it because, as I was told over and over again, it was just going to be another fluff-headed Spielberg summer blockbuster starring that jerk Tom Cruise. I managed to get a few of these naysayers to see the flick and they came away also convinced that something genuinely unique had happened here. Frankly, I think it's one of the most remarkable films I've ever seen. Someday, perhaps, it may be seen as the third entry to Spielberg's monumental war trilogy (possible quartet since he's now doing one on terrorism). That would be Schindler, Ryan, and now this.It would take pages and pages to go over the noteworthy aspects of this film starting with the fact that there is no invasion depicted her, not even a war (it's more like ""farming"") and that the first appearance of the aliens is almost exactly the ending of the 50's George Pal movie played backwards. Some of the symbolism of that scene still hasn't been commented on.Much of this film, like some of Schindler and the first half hour of Ryan owes much to classic avant-garde and art film and little to summer blockbusters (The first part of Ryan was an unprecedented departure from popular film making!). I saw much in this incredible movie that reminded me of Tarkovsky and others. The art direction was stunning and the use of CGI, for the first time in memory, totally inspired. A nightmare, a mind-numbing nightmare, but a visually stunning nightmare.Spielberg seemed to have consciously subverted the expectations of the audience and I was amazed at how carefully that message was interwoven into the script. War of the Worlds is brutal, possibly the most brutal film to have ever reached a mass audience, and its relentless depictions of social breakdown and dehumanization are among the most powerful I've ever encountered in any film. Spielberg has made a stupendous breakthrough here by using the resources of the best of what Hollywood has to offer and the money available for a project like this to confront audiences with a film that is only superficially acceptable as a typical mass-market theatrical release.In a sense the film is a tribute to plenty of 50's era science-fiction and not only George Pal's previous shot at this story. I even caught a visual quote from ""The Black Scorpion""--a movie that has one of the most nightmarish scenes imaginable. This misses the point though. What seems to have captured Spielberg's imagination is a style and a kind of visual lexicon that derives more from the surrealist style of Cameron Menzies in the remarkable ""Invaders from Mars"" and other similarly atmospheric films from that era. A lot of sci-fi has been produced since that Golden Age but very little of it, until this film, could be described as ""poetic"" (2001, Fahrenheit 451, only maybe the first Alien, but not Star Wars and most else). Our loss. I could write hundreds of pages on the poetry of old-school effects work versus modern design and CGI but I sure as heck won't here. I'd argue War of the Worlds is the most visually poetic science-fiction film ever made.Anyway, these suggestions:a) Keep young kids away from this movie and worry a bit about the older kids who are not horrified by some of the things they see here. Hard to admit but the first time I went to see it I walked out about 3/4 of an hour before the end. I've seen some heavy films but this got too horrific for even me at one point. I realized later that Speilberg held back, a few changes here and there and most would've run from this. I know a few other people who were messed up a bit by the experience and one woman, otherwise sensible, who shook like a leaf through most of it and also had to exit before the end.b) If you like avant-garde and independent film, if you like poetic film and powerful imagery be prepared to be knocked on your fanny. Just one thing that happens in this film was one of the most stunning and unforgettable images I'd ever seen in a lifetime of film viewing. When I saw it in the theater I responded audibly to that moment ""Oh...my...God..."" That sort of thing happened to me many times duringmy first viewing--I was totally horrified by what i was seeing but I was simultaneously in awe of the genius of the film.c) If you hated the film go back and give it another chance. I've gone as far as telling people to pretend it's some art film by an Eastern European director that'll end up on Criterion someday.d) If you were bothered by the lack of logic or the unbelievable trajectory of the plot please try to think of the film as a genuine nightmare filled with metaphors; it's not really about Martians or invasions (It seems to be about us and what we're turning into). Look at what's going on in the background every time Cruise and his ""son"" fight. Find it odd that the ""Martians"" only destroy transportation--means of escape--and actually do little damage otherwise. They're focused almost entirely on genocide, not destruction of property. Pay close attention to the use of sound in this film--if it doesn't get an Academy Award for that alone I'll be stunned.Honestly, once the dust clears and more people have a chance to ponder it, Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" will start turning up on people's Best Films Ever lists.",5,A Few Items,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,5320,"['was', 'genuinely', 'stunned', 'movie', 'Few', 'friends',

635625,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JNTI,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 5]","Downright scary at times, ""War of the Worlds"" provides Spielberg with the chance to play boogeyman in this sleek adapation of H. G. Wells' classic novel. The film has many references to the 1953 version made by George Pal (in fact the stars from that film appear at the end as the parents of Ray's ex-wife)and contemporary references as well (it's clear that Spielberg took our post 9/11 paranoia and the havoc that the terrorist attack caused as his inspiration for moments in this film). This movie won't be for everyone. I've read some other reviews here and while I disagree with the negative ones, I also admit that ""War of the Worlds"" isn't a perfect movie. Just a reminder folks that ""Jaws"" didn't explain what really happened, why the shark decided to attack the people in the town nor did it explain why the shark went after (or knew to go after) Quint and his boat. It's only a movie folks and sometimes films, like novels, don't reflect real life but they have their own internal logic. You just have to get on the ride and enjoy it for what it is.Ray (Tom Cruise)has become a weekend father; his divorce and the remarriage of his ex-wife Mary Ann(Miranda Otto from ""The Two Towers"" and ""Return of the King"")has allowed him to emotionally isolate himself from his kids and bury himself in his work as a dock worker. Mary Ann leaves the kids for the weekend Ray instructs his daughter and son to order take out while he sleeps. When a nasty thunder storm breaks out he isn't overly concerned until he realizes that none of the cars work and all the watches have stopped. Ray quickly finds out the electricity is out and people have all massed outside. When the ground begins to shake, roll and crack clearly the invasion has begun...The image quality looks marvelous for either edition of the  the movie--keep in mind it's supposed to be gritty looking that was the intention all along.  The single disc edition of ""War of the Worlds"" features only 1 featurette ""Designing the Enemy"" (which is relocated to the second disc for the two disc edition). It's a solid featurette with plenty of pre-production designs and pre-visualization footage incorporated into interviews with production designer Rick Carter, Kathleen Kennedy and others discussing the homage to the 1953 film and the elements that Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp wanted to retain from Wells' turn of the century novel.""Revisiting the Original Invasion"" a featurette where Spielberg discusses the genesis of wanting to revisit Wells' novel. He notes that ""War of the Worlds"" touches a nerve because it's more than science fiction; it reflects our personal fears and the element of humanity when faced with an overwhelming force. This features behind-the-scenes footage and Spielberg discussing how the science fiction films of the 50's ( and particularly the original film of ""The War of the Worlds"") and how impacted his films. He also notes how 9/11 informs THIS ""War of the Worlds"" and a different mindset in the 21st century allowing the film to become topical again. Tom Cruise also discusses working with Spielberg and Koepp. Koepp discusses how he wanted to avoid the clich&eacute;s of the genre and wanting to personalize the invasion touching on how it would impact the average American. Koepp went back to the novel's point-of-view which was centered around the hero's experience.""The H. G. Wells Legacy"" briefly discusses Wells' life featuring interviews with Wells' grandson and great-grandson (director Simon Wells who updated his great-grandfather's novel ""The Time Machine"" a couple of years ago). It's pretty superficial but does discuss Wells' ordinary origin and how writing was his fall-back position as his career as a school teacher came to a halt due to an injury. Taken with the Wells' featurette for the 1953 DVD both are very good but it is incomplete by itself.""Previsualization"" incorporates location footage, interviews and early CGI footage to give an overview on how the film was visualized. Spielberg didn't like to do pre-visualization until Lucas inspired him to do so after his latest ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Spielberg found that the pre-visualization doesn't always apply because of variables on the set. To prevent that from happening the sets weren't designed until the pre-visualization was done so that things didn't have to be radically revamped.""War Chronicles"" is a series of video featurettes featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage for this bi-coastal production. The featurettes are broken up into the various stages of production from pre-production to ""Destruction"", etc. for both the west coast where the town was rebuild for the destruction sequences and the location footage. Spielberg appears minimally during all these featurettes as does Tom Cruise. The featurettes primarily focuses on people like visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren from ILM, production crew, etc.""Scoring of `War of the Worlds'"" features behind-the-scenes footage of Williams scoring the film and discussing his inspiration for the film. Spielberg wanted to make a film with Cruise where Cruise didn't play the hero running off to fight the bad guys. ""Characters: The Family Unit"" features Spielberg the most discussing working with Tom Cruise, rehearsing and discussing the scenes on set with the cast. Cruise is also featured luckily he gives us a break and doesn't do another song and dance on the benefits of Scientology and his expertise on depression and psychiatric care. Cruise keeps his comments confined to his character and working on the film. Screenwriter David Koepp discusses his rule (which he discussed with Spielberg) about focusing only on what Ray and see and experience to give the audience a handle on the invasion. You'll also note that we don't see the destruction of any major landmarks. This was another clich&eacute; (that Koepp discusses elsewhere and also in the limited edition Screenplay book available at Bestbuy.com) that Koepp wanted to avoid as it tends to magnify the experience and take away the intimate nature of this invasion. This ""War of the Worlds"" focuses, much like Wells' novel, on an ordinary people and how this overwhelming invasion force impacts them on a much more personal, small basis. It's a wise approach allowing Spielberg to avoid the pitfalls that undermined ""Independence Day"" and most of the disaster thrillers we see. It also makes this film much more into a suspense thriller or horror movie vs. a disaster movie.Unfortunately, Spielberg has once again avoided giving a commentary track. If he's so uncomfortable doing them perhaps he should have his line-producer or visual effects experts do it. More than likely it's simply that he doesn't want to dispel the magic of the film.A fun thriller, ""War of the Worlds"" won't win any of the big Academy Awards this year but that doesn't mean it's any less a good movie or that the themes examined here are any less valuable. The original novel was about Imperial Britain; Welles' radio broadcast could be seen as a good old fashioned entertainment with a subtext on the rise of fascism in Europe; the 1953 film used the paranoia of the Cold War to good effect. Likewise Spielberg's film does take into account the post-9/11 terrorist world we live in his reinterpretation. The good news is that you can sit back and enjoy Spielberg's film as a straight thriller or look much deeper at the themes that are at the heart of the film.

635627,AM1C02CE4WGPC,B00005JNTI,"W. Corse ""OldOneEye""","[3, 5]","Spielberg's ""War"" is excellent on almost every count, a gripping drama with elements of true horror mixed in with some truly inspired acting.  This movie benefits from its excellent cast almost as much as the timeless story it tells, step by gritty step.Director Spielberg approaches this story in much the same way as he did ""Saving Private Ryan"":  an ""in-your-face"" realism that is at times hard to watch, except you can't quite turn away. Tom Cruise brings real pathos to his character, an anti-hero compared to his previous roles, who is forced to overcome his own fear and flawed nature simply to survive, while somehow finding a way protect his two children.  Dakota Fanning's intensity is amazing to watch, particularly when she must react to things that no child should ever see.Much like the original novel, we see the events through the eyes of Cruise's character, a ""view from the bottom"" if you will.  Spielberg incorporates a number of elements from the H.G. Wells novel that make this film more faithful to Well's original vision that either the 1953 film or the Orson Welles radio broadcast.  There are a couple of obvious allusions to the 9/11 attacks, but there is no political commentary here, just the battle to survive.As well-done as this film is, it cannot be called entertaining. It's a true war movie in which several scenes will make you cringe, not because they're gratuitous or overly vivid, but because they represent a darker reality than many of us want to admit exists.  The only messages you will get are the obvious ones:  real war is Hell, and survival is a noble cause in and of itself.  The film's imagery is stark and vivid throughout, and there is no sense of triumph at the end.  The film instead celebrates the faith and perserverance of its lead characters far more than the ""victory"" that humanity finally receives, a victory that comes only after all human effort has completely failed, in keeping with the classic ending from the novel.Many people will dislike this movie, but I encourage anyone who can stand being frightened for the right reasons to watch and own this film.  It will become a classic, perhaps even be seen as one of Spielberg's best efforts in the years to come.  Like it or hate it, no one who watches this movie will emerge unchanged.",5,"A different kind of ""E.T.""",1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,2299,"['Spielberg', 'War', 'excellent', 'almost', 'count', 'gripping', 'drama', 'elements', 'true', 'horror', 'mixed', 'truly', 'inspired', 'acting', 'movie', 'benefits', 'excellent', 'cast', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'timeless', 'story', 'step', 'gritty', 'step.Director', 'Spielberg', 'story', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'in-your-face', 'realism', 'times', 'hard', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'turn', 'away', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'real', 'pathos', 'character', 'anti-hero', 'compared', 'previous', 'roles', 'who', 'forced', 'overcome', 'own', 'fear', 'flawed', 'nature', 'simply', 'survive', 'somehow', 'finding', 'way', 'protect', 'two', 'children', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'intensity', 'amazing', 'watch', 'particularly', 'when', 'must', 'react', 'things', 'child', 'should', 'ever', 'see.Much', 'original', 'novel', 'see', 'events', 'eyes', 'Cruise', 'character', 'view', 'bottom', 'will', 'Spielberg', 'number', 'elements', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'novel', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'faithful', 'Well', 'original', 'vision', '1953', 'film', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'are', 'couple', 'obvious', 'allusions', '9/11', 'attacks', 'political', 'commentary', 'here', 'just', 'battle', 'survive.As', 'well-done', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'entertaining', 'true', 'war', 'movie', 'several', 'scenes', 'will', 'make', 'cringe', 'not', ""'re"", 'gratuitous', 'overly', 'vivid', 'represent', 'darker', 'reality', 'many', 'want', 'admit', 'exists', 'only', 'messages', 'will', 'get', 'are', 'obvious', 'ones', 'real', 'war', 'Hell', 'survival', 'noble', 'cause', 'film', 'imagery', 'stark', 'vivid', 'sense', 'triumph', 'end', 'film', 'instead', 'faith', 'perserverance', 'lead', 'characters', 'far', 'more', 'victory', 'humanity', 'finally', 'victory', 'only', 'human', 'effort', 'completely', 'failed', 'keeping', 'classic', 'ending', 'novel.Many', 'people', 'will', 'dislike', 'movie', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'stand', 'being', 'frightened', 'right', 'reasons', 'watch', 'own', 'film', 'will', 'become', 'classic', 'perhaps', 'even', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'Spielberg', 'best', 'efforts', 'years', 'come', 'hate', 'one', 'who', 'movie', 'will', 'emerge', 'unchanged']",N/A

And I hate movies that try to preach to me, so I never went and saw it.  I should have figured the source of the review, the New York Times, the most biased newspaper on the planet, hell they probably force their reviewers to inject an anti-Bush statement in every movie review.  It's a little bit ridiculous when the whole paper is like that.  Have you read the weather report in the Times lately?.  Just kidding, lolBit that's all beside the point, and the point is that this is a great movie.  War of the Worlds has a cachet that's hard to overcome, the Orson Welles radio broadcast in the late 30's panicked a good part of the east coast that thought it was real.  I still remember listening to a rebroadcast of that in the late 60's or early 70's one Halloween night.  Of course, by that time, I'd already been scared out of my socks watching the George Pal film version made in the 50's on late night TV.So Speilberg had a lot to overcome to do this movie justice to begin with, and for the most part he succeeds.  I have rarely seen anything as scary as the scene where the first alien shows up, spits the car back out of it's hole and rises from the ground and bellows a defiant roar before it starts killing everyone in site.  Or later on at the ferry, when Tom Cruise's daughter, played by Dakota Fanning, sees the tree tops moving on the ridge and realizes the aliens have caught up to them.Speilberg is the master of the unseen, in Jaws he made a great movie about a shark when the special affects crew could barely keep the fake, mechanical Shark working.  In his first movie, Duel, he builds up the evil truck driver and you never once see the guy on screen.Whether it a phalanx of aliens in their tripods killing an entire town, or a few aliens unmounted searching through a basement, or a gigantic, climactic battle happening just over the ridge, Speilberg enlightens the viewer by omission.  He invites you to scare yourself by imagining the worst thing you could ever think of, and you do exactly that.Spielberg throws just enough in their to chill your spine, the goose bumps really arise when your imnagination takes over.

It does seem that many people who have rated that they didn't care for this movie just don't like Tom Cruise. My review will reflect my feelings about the movie itself and not the actors involved. I really enjoy large special effects sci-fi, fantasy and action/adventure movies and feel that this movie is a good example of those types of movies. The special effects are excellent and Spielberg delivers some creative and effective camera shots such as the long extended un-cut shot from many angles of them driving in the van on their way out of town. I also liked the premise of the film as we follow how the average every day person reacts to such a cataclysmic event. In recent movie such as Independence Day, we get to see the President and how the government reacts to an alien invasion. In this film those events are happening but they are occurring on the peripheral and not the center of the story.  My only two complaints with the story are that the movie slows down too much when they spend time in the basement  but then once they are out of the basement it ends too quickly. The basement scenes have some great and essential parts to the story such as the encounter with the aliens (which are fantastic looking) and the disturbing murder of Tim Robbins character. But at this point of the movie the story almost comes to a grinding halt. I would have liked to have seen more in regards to how the aliens begin to die off and what effect that has on people. But all-in-all I like this movie and it will have repeated viewings in my house.",4,Well made Sci-fi movie,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1611,"['am', 'bit', 'surprised', 'many', 'low', 'ratings', 'movie', 'seem', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'rated', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'My', 'review', 'will', 'reflect', 'feelings', 'movie', 'not', 'actors', 'involved', 'really', 'enjoy', 'large', 'special', 'effects', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'action/adventure', 'movies', 'feel', 'movie', 'good', 'example', 'types', 'movies', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'Spielberg', 'creative', 'effective', 'camera', 'shots', 'such', 'long', 'extended', 'un-cut', 'shot', 'many', 'angles', 'driving', 'van', 'way', 'town', 'also', 'liked', 'premise', 'film', 'follow', 'how', 'average', 'day', 'person', 'such', 'cataclysmic', 'event', 'recent', 'movie', 'such', 'Independence', 'Day', 'get', 'see', 'President', 'how', 'government', 'alien', 'invasion', 'film', 'events', 'are', 'happening', 'are', 'occurring', 'peripheral', 'not', 'center', 'story', 'only', 'two', 'complaints', 'story', 'are', 'movie', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'spend', 'time', 'basement', 'then', 'are', 'basement', 'too', 'quickly', 'basement', 'scenes', 'have', 'great', 'essential', 'parts', 'story', 'such', 'encounter', 'aliens', 'are', 'fantastic', 'looking', 'disturbing', 'murder', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'point', 'movie', 'story', 'almost', 'grinding', 'halt', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'regards', 'how', 'aliens', 'begin', 'die', 'off', 'effect', 'people', 'all-in-all', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'house']",N/A

The story is full of plot holes, logistical problems, and other defects which make me lose interest in a film quicker than I can hit the ""off"" button.In an early scene, an actor says, ""They planted these machines here millions of years ago, before humans even existed. They've been planning this all this time."" Hello? If humans didn't exist, what were they planting the machines and planning for clear back then? That is the type of illogic that permeates nearly every single scene in the film. One might suppose, perhaps, that the aliens somehow knew humans would evolve, and then come back to harvest them when tender, plump and ripe, but why would they have to plant machines in the ground millions of years ago to do that? I mean, just think of all the water that must have accumulated in their carburetors after all those years. And if the aliens were somehow intelligent enough to have foreknowledge of human evolution, how did they manage to overlook the evolution of a simple bacteria or virus that could wipe them out?You'll never scream more while watching a scary movie.

To make this a 5 star, they could have removed all but one central character and pattern it after the novel which was told in the first person.  Tom Cruise and Fanning were both unnecessary and the same effect could have been accomplished with a lesser known cast.  The story stands on its own and does not need the presence of overrated cast members to carry it.  Spielberg really didn't need to wait for Cruise to be available in order to make this film successful.It's hard to top the George Pal story of the early 50's.  The make it even more authentic, the setting should have been in England as was the original story.  Somehow, New Jersey seems a silly place for an initial Martian landing.

635643,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005JNTI,Wuchak,"[2, 2]","Steven Spielberg's 2005 version of H.G. Well's ""War of the Worlds"" tells the story of a divorced man (Tom Cruise) and his son & daughter facing a horrifying alien invasion of Earth. They attempt to travel from New York City to Boston, where the kids' mother lives.WHAT WORKS: Interestingly, I went to see this film at the theater with a friend who strongly reminded me of Cruise's character in the film. He's divorced, the kids live with the ex-wife, and he's the type of guy who would have a car engine on his kitchen table. Hence, the family scenario was very real to us.Speaking of real, the story is presented in a very realistic, serious manner. You don't have to worry about the goofiness and jingoistic elements that plagued 1996's ""Independence Day"" (I can't stand that film).What works best are the towering and utterly horrifying alien tripods. They skulk around on their long massive legs destroying everything and everyone in sight, while taking some people captive, shredding them up and spitting out their blood & guts as food for their alien plants (which is, evidently, one of the alien's primary food sources). This, of course, creates an incredibly eerie reddish landscape.I love the intimidating bellow of the tripods.There are numerous memorable scenes: The opening attack in New York/New Jersey, the Hudson River ferry scene, the train in flames, the military night fight on the hill and the basement sequence.I also love the authentic Eastern locations, filmed in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and New Jersey.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Spielberg masterfully creates the illusion that the story is REAL and could possibly happen, but then blows it with sequences that destroy all credibility. Take, for instance, the plane crash segment. The jet crashes and destroys practically the entire neighborhood, including the house Cruise and his kids are staying at (in the basement). Yet, miraculously, their vehicle remains completely unscathed, not to mention they're able to easily drive out through the enormous amount of debris. Why Sure!This is insulting to the intelligence of the viewer and ruins the aura of realism. What was Spielberg thinking? He's a great filmmaker but he makes these kinds of blunders too often. Remember the scene in ""Jurrasic Park: The Lost World"" where the colossal t.rex's are able to quietly sneek up on a campsite of people, yet in every other scene the ground literally shakes when they approach? Or how about the moronic and melodramatic dogtag sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan""?Spielberg likes to include father/son conflicts in his stories, which is fine, but he horribly fumbles the ball in this regard in ""War Of the Worlds."" Specifically, I'm talking about the military fight on the hill sequence where Cruise's son ludicrously decides to leave his dad and sister to presumably help fight the aliens (or who knows what?). But, wait a second, he's only 15 or 16 years old; he doesn't know anything about military weaponry or tactics, how could he possible be of any help? The entire scene where the son insists on separating from his dad and sister is just stoo-pid and unbelievable.BOTTOM LINE: I'd give the film a solid A- or B+ if it wasn't for the incredibly dumb sequences just noted. The only way I can watch and enjoy the picture is to make believe they're not there. These negative aspects force me to lower my rating to C+ or, at best, B-.

Wells' ability to raise Science Fiction to art, considering the 100 years or so between novel and film, it was remarkably topical.First, the ending of the film. I suspect people would have enjoyed histrionics and more carnage than your run of the mill adventure/horror/etc film, but it is respectful to the previous film and book. It could have been built up better, perhaps, but in a culture of ""explain this in very exacting language and images for I'm not getting paid to think when at the films"" I chalk up a lot of the ending problems with 21st century 'turn back the clock' on education, ala 1980's Reagan-era America.The ending of the film IS NECESSARY artistically and while I couldn't stand Tom Cruise's annoying behavior and the fixation of news orginiztions to cover that wacky Scientologist it was so off-putting that the fear and terror I saw watching this very scary film had nothing to do with Cruise's second or third mid-life crisis and was actually due to good filmcraft, that I a absolutely thrilled to see this modest political film done in a sombre tone that makes for a great adult film that has a strong theme followed by beautifully shot and acted moments throughout the film.Tim Robbins neo-survivalist, quite possibly crazy and most definately another human threat to character Ray Fanning's nightmare of a day. The negligent father demanding yet not deserving of respect until he steps up to his responsibilities and demonstrates to his children that he's capable of being a real father.I'm shocked at the blaze response to Spielberg's take on War of the Worlds and find a childish response to many of the negative reviews here, and not surprisingly, to the original artforms, as if being true to the spirit of the novel and the 60s film is in some way of little importance when it comes to the lack of creepiness and violence some felt cheated out of.History will be kind to this version of War of the Worlds. It is somewhat pathetic that a good portion of the audience prefers to be spoon-fed it's films. I was taken in within the first scene of the other worlders initial attack. The brutal yet beautiful filming of the end of the world and the expected and lived up to loss of civilization within realization of the USA getting a whooping and not fighting back, which I'll bet is playing into a lot of ""Be all that you can be"" commercials paid perhaps a bit too much attention to in real US politics.I think the idea that we don't control our own fate bothers people and probably did much better than Spielberg intended; by making hostile a big segment of this film's crowd.But it's interesting that when Spielberg is on track to make a serious and honest film like Munich, his entertainment film is usually a bit more ""entertaining"" rather than played for thrills rather than a slice of reality.Maybe I'm not so surprised people have such yammering diatribes against the film. Who wants to be confronted by a little bit of honesty with that slab of entertainment?As for my perceptions, Spielberg has given me the chills, not since Alien, or The Birds. His War of the Worlds is a savage and frightening 2 hours of entertainment with mild doses of how weak a world we are, how close to the precipice mankind is. I'd say make sure to see this film, but its late in the game and most people already did see it.Lastly, the sober soundtrack added to tension rather than directed you toward it, something I often dislike in John William's work. Here, is the kind of thought put into a ""serious"" flick and does so much more to emphasise the horrific situation of mankind.But I bought into the story in a way many decided not to.
