908066,A2Z8SIZVKESSJC,B0009MAPKO,Chapulina R,"[53, 57]","The adjectives which come to mind -- sweet, luscious, charming -- describe ""You I Love,"" a fable about an unusual love triangle in ultra-modern Moscow.  Handsome Timofei and beautiful Vera are young lovers, both successful professionals.  He designs TV commercials (""Lyubov' -- eto Kola!""); she is a popular newscaster.  Enter Ulumzhi, a sensual yet appealingly innocent Kalmyk newcomer, who takes a day job as a zookeeper.  When Timofei accidently bumps into Ulumzhi (literally, with his car), he takes the injured homeless youth into his apartment.  Arriving unexpectedly, Vera is stunned to discover Timofei and Ulumzhi have begun a passionate romance.  At first hurt and angry, Vera cannot help befriending the extremely likable Asian boy.  In fact, she cannot help her own physical attraction to the agreeable young man.  Her dilemma: dump her boyfriend or share him with Ulumzhi?  When Ulumzhi's uncle drags him back to his village, hoping to make a ""real man"" out of his disappointing ""goluboi"" nephew, Vera thinks she at last has Timofei to herself.  But they both miss Ulumzhi more than they can bear.  This movie had me laughing out loud in the theater.  Particularly funny are the two cabbies' sly references to ""you know who,"" a certain someone high up in the government purported to be secretly gay (hint: think ""Goluboe Salo"")!  I thoroughly enjoyed the great scenes of the newly vibrant Moscow, as well as the sensuous (yet refreshingly ""chaste"") scenes on the Persian rugs!  All three actors are simply, exquisitely, gorgeous!  The term ""eye-candy"" could have been coined for this trio!  Overall, a delightful film, in Russian with English subtitles.",5,Sweet,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,1666,"['adjectives', 'come', 'mind', 'sweet', 'luscious', 'charming', 'describe', 'Love', 'fable', 'unusual', 'love', 'triangle', 'ultra-modern', 'Moscow', 'Handsome', 'Timofei', 'beautiful', 'Vera', 'are', 'young', 'lovers', 'successful', 'professionals', 'TV', 'commercials', 'Lyubov', 'eto', 'Kola', 'popular', 'newscaster', 'Enter', 'Ulumzhi', 'sensual', 'yet', 'appealingly', 'innocent', 'Kalmyk', 'newcomer', 'who', 'day', 'job', 'zookeeper', 'When', 'Timofei', 'accidently', 'Ulumzhi', 'literally', 'car', 'injured', 'homeless', 'youth', 'apartment', 'Arriving', 'unexpectedly', 'Vera', 'stunned', 'discover', 'Timofei', 'Ulumzhi', 'have', 'begun', 'passionate', 'romance', 'first', 'hurt', 'angry', 'Vera', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'befriending', 'extremely', 'likable', 'Asian', 'boy', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'own', 'physical', 'attraction', 'agreeable', 'young', 'man', 'dilemma', 'dump', 'boyfriend', 'share', 'Ulumzhi', 'When', 'Ulumzhi', 'uncle', 'back', 'village', 'hoping', 'make', 'real', 'man', 'disappointing', 'goluboi', 'nephew', 'Vera', 'last', 'Timofei', 'miss', 'Ulumzhi', 'more', 'can', 'bear', 'movie', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'theater', 'Particularly', 'funny', 'are', 'two', 'cabbies', 'sly', 'references', 'know', 'who', 'certain', 'someone', 'high', 'up', 'government', 'purported', 'be', 'secretly', 'gay', 'hint', 'think', 'Goluboe', 'Salo', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'scenes', 'newly', 'vibrant', 'Moscow', 'as', 'well', 'sensuous', 'yet', 'refreshingly', 'chaste', 'scenes', 'Persian', 'rugs', 'three', 'actors', 'are', 'simply', 'exquisitely', 'gorgeous', 'term', 'eye-candy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'coined', 'trio', 'Overall', 'delightful', 'film', 'Russian', 'English', 'subtitles']",You I Love
908067,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009MAPKO,Grady Harp,"[10, 11]","YA LYUBLU TEBYA (You I Love) is a fast paced bonbon of a movie from Russia being hailed in some circles as the 'hottest gay film of the year'.  Hot it is not: fun it is.  The message from director/writers Olga Stolpovskaja and Dmitry Troitsky seems more a PR statement about how Westernized and modern in social behavior Russia has become since Perestroika than creating a significant gay film.  Yet somehow the result is a rapid sequence entertainment that should appeal to a very wide audience.Timofei (Evgeny Koryakovsky) is a young, successful ad executive in Moscow, able to afford all of the luxuries of his Western counterparts.  He is in a relationship with Vera (Lyubov Tolkalina) who is a popular TV personality.  They have a fresh and vital lifestyle, emphasizing the manifestations of capitalism.  Simultaneously we meet Uloomji (Damir Badmaev) who comes from the poorer provinces, the son of a strict and struggling  worker family.  Uloomji strikes out for Moscow to find a job and a life.  He 'accidentally' encounters Timofei who feels sorry for the homeless youth and takes him to his apartment for care...and cavorting!  The socially naive Uloomji and the sexually naive Timofei  collide (the metaphor is readily apparent) and are discovered in embrace when Vera returns home. The remainder of the story is how the two men and one woman grow into a m&eacute;nage a trois of sorts and how the friends and families of the three respond.While the story is really one of bisexuality it is played as a drawing room comedy (?TV sitcom Moscow style?) and while the film takes a lot of visual and technical chances - some of which work well, others spoil - the final result is a light entertainment that doesn't really push the edge purported by the trailers and the PR media glut.  The three main actors are excellent and show promise of becoming stars in their own right.  This is a fun film that asks the audience to just step on for the ride for an inside look at the now-open Moscow life!Grady Harp, July 05",4,A Refreshing Peek Inside Post-Perestroika Moscow Social Life,1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,2021,"['YA', 'LYUBLU', 'TEBYA', 'Love', 'fast', 'paced', 'bonbon', 'movie', 'Russia', 'being', 'hailed', 'circles', ""'hottest"", 'gay', 'film', 'year', 'Hot', 'not', 'fun', 'message', 'director/writers', 'Olga', 'Stolpovskaja', 'Dmitry', 'Troitsky', 'more', 'PR', 'statement', 'how', 'Westernized', 'modern', 'social', 'behavior', 'Russia', 'become', 'Perestroika', 'creating', 'significant', 'gay', 'film', 'somehow', 'result', 'rapid', 'sequence', 'entertainment', 'should', 'appeal', 'very', 'wide', 'audience.Timofei', 'Evgeny', 'Koryakovsky', 'young', 'successful', 'ad', 'executive', 'Moscow', 'able', 'afford', 'luxuries', 'Western', 'counterparts', 'relationship', 'Vera', 'Lyubov', 'Tolkalina', 'who', 'popular', 'TV', 'personality', 'have', 'fresh', 'vital', 'lifestyle', 'emphasizing', 'manifestations', 'capitalism', 'Simultaneously', 'meet', 'Uloomji', 'Damir', 'Badmaev', 'who', 'poorer', 'provinces', 'son', 'strict', 'struggling', 'worker', 'family', 'Uloomji', 'out', 'Moscow', 'find', 'job', 'life', ""'accidentally"", 'encounters', 'Timofei', 'who', 'feels', 'sorry', 'homeless', 'youth', 'apartment', 'care', 'cavorting', 'socially', 'naive', 'Uloomji', 'sexually', 'naive', 'Timofei', 'collide', 'metaphor', 'readily', 'apparent', 'are', 'discovered', 'embrace', 'when', 'Vera', 'home', 'remainder', 'story', 'how', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'woman', 'grow', 'm', 'eacute', 'trois', 'sorts', 'how', 'friends', 'families', 'three', 'story', 'really', 'one', 'bisexuality', 'played', 'drawing', 'room', 'comedy', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'Moscow', 'style', 'film', 'lot', 'visual', 'technical', 'chances', 'work', 'well', 'others', 'spoil', 'final', 'result', 'light', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'really', 'push', 'edge', 'purported', 'trailers', 'PR', 'media', 'glut', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'show', 'promise', 'becoming', 'stars', 'own', 'right', 'fun', 'film', 'audience', 'just', 'step', 'ride', 'inside', 'look', 'now-open', 'Moscow', 'life', 'Grady', 'Harp', 'July', '05']",You I Love
908068,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B0009MAPKO,Jeffery Mingo,"[41, 58]","This film deals with a white Russian who has a white girlfriend but  falls in love with a gay Asian Russian.American viewers will be surprised by this view of Russia.  This film has no dreary Iron Curtain imagery.  This film presents Russia as any other European country, a place full of technology, consumerism, and people having full as their ultimate goal.Unfortunately, this love triangle is unrealistic.  The straight female is a TV anchorwoman and is very pretty.  If any man cheated on a woman like this, whether he was gay, straight, or bisexual, she would leave him because she would have so many other options.  Thus, I think this may be a bisexual man's fantasy more than something that could happen in real life.  I just can't see a person being able to have their cake and eat it too as it happens in this movie.I've always heard that Russia has people of color, but this is the first time I've seen that on the screen.  It was fascinating to see Asians who are Russian citizens.  The dynamic between the whites and the Asians here didn't seem as antagonistic as movies portray the relationship between white and black Americans.  This film suggests that difference arise not due to race, but to class and urbanity.  For those who take the bell hooks approach, they may be frustrated that the most homophobic characters are straights of color.  This film also had gay men of color of other ethnic backgrounds as well.This was not a superior film.  But since I have never seen a gay film from Russia, it was a novel and enjoyable experience.",3,Bisexual Man's Fantasy,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,1553,"['film', 'white', 'Russian', 'who', 'white', 'girlfriend', 'love', 'gay', 'Asian', 'Russian.American', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'view', 'Russia', 'film', 'dreary', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'imagery', 'film', 'Russia', 'other', 'European', 'country', 'place', 'full', 'technology', 'consumerism', 'people', 'having', 'full', 'ultimate', 'goal.Unfortunately', 'love', 'triangle', 'unrealistic', 'straight', 'female', 'TV', 'anchorwoman', 'very', 'pretty', 'man', 'cheated', 'woman', 'was', 'gay', 'straight', 'bisexual', 'would', 'leave', 'would', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'options', 'Thus', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'bisexual', 'man', 'fantasy', 'more', 'something', 'could', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'person', 'being', 'able', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'movie.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'heard', 'Russia', 'people', 'color', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'was', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Asians', 'who', 'are', 'Russian', 'citizens', 'dynamic', 'whites', 'Asians', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'antagonistic', 'movies', 'portray', 'relationship', 'white', 'black', 'Americans', 'film', 'difference', 'arise', 'not', 'due', 'race', 'class', 'urbanity', 'who', 'take', 'bell', 'approach', 'may', 'be', 'frustrated', 'most', 'homophobic', 'characters', 'are', 'straights', 'color', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'gay', 'men', 'color', 'other', 'ethnic', 'backgrounds', 'well.This', 'was', 'not', 'superior', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'gay', 'film', 'Russia', 'was', 'novel', 'enjoyable', 'experience']",You I Love

In post-communist Russia, everyone wants to be someone, but nobody quite knows who that someone is. In this surreal world, three people's lives become entwined in ways both painful and funny.  The trio make a bizarre peace with one another until the usual set of angry parents set that world on its ears.  The ending slips into fantasy, but it is a charming fantasy.The movie is a romp, a bedroom comedy that involves the kitchen, the living room, the shower.  It's a fantasy of self-discovery that supplants the surreal journey of consumerism with the attempt of each character to make sense of all that confuses and realize it is you I love.",4,An Amazing Movie,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,718,"['premise', 'far', 'too', 'improbable', 'result', 'very', 'believable', 'post-communist', 'Russia', 'everyone', 'be', 'someone', 'nobody', 'quite', 'knows', 'who', 'someone', 'surreal', 'world', 'three', 'people', 'lives', 'become', 'entwined', 'ways', 'painful', 'funny', 'trio', 'make', 'bizarre', 'peace', 'one', 'usual', 'set', 'angry', 'parents', 'set', 'world', 'ears', 'ending', 'slips', 'fantasy', 'charming', 'fantasy.The', 'movie', 'romp', 'bedroom', 'comedy', 'kitchen', 'living', 'room', 'shower', 'fantasy', 'self-discovery', 'surreal', 'journey', 'consumerism', 'attempt', 'character', 'make', 'sense', 'confuses', 'realize', 'love']",You I Love
908070,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0009MAPKO,Lee Armstrong,"[14, 14]","First time directors Olga Stolpovskyaya and Dmitry Troitsky have come up with this fluffy bit of eye candy.  Timofei played by Evgeny Koryakovsky in what appears to be his first role is an advertising professional with a stable job and nurses a bizarre relationship with Vera, a TV show host played by Lyubov Tolkalina.  Their somewhat on again-off again relationship is punctuated with unusual foreplay such as Timofei dressing himself in a cellophane loincloth with vegetables strategically disguising his most private anatomy.  Damir Badmaev plays the naive urchin Uloomji.  Uloomji is of Kalmyk descent, the only Buddhist nation in Europe.  He apparently has come to Moscow and looks with wonder at ATM machines while he sleeps at the zoo and helps tend the animals.  He literally falls off a fence onto Timofei's car.  Unable to get medical attention for the lad, Timofei takes Uloomji to his apartment.  There Uloomji playfully seduces Timofei until Vera walks in.  The film then progresses with mild shots of the guys shooting each other with water while clothed in the shower and suggestively sudsy foam splattering across their bare chests as they physically delight in each other.  The film veers back and forth with the subplot of Uloomji's family coming to intervene and extract him from this decadent lifestyle.  We flashback to Uloomji and see his development while fond shots of sheep are edited into the mix.  The end suggests that three can live together if their love is not possessive and allows each to pursue that which is closest to their hearts.  The Russian flavor makes the story seem fresh, at least worth one night's viewing.

908072,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0009MAPKO,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","I was not expecting too much from this Russian gay comedy, and so was blown away (not in a rude sense mind) by how great it actually is. It is a love story but one that involves three people. We meet Tomofei (Evgeniy Korayakoviskiy) he is an advertising executive who does strange adds for `Cola'. He meets anchor woman Vera Krillova and they sort of fall for each other right away. She has a penchant for food as an aphrodisiac, which gives a whole new meaning to the Cockney phrase of `up the apples and pears' - if you get my drift.Anyway he accidentally runs into country bumpkin Uloomji, who is living in the Zoo having failed to get into college and is too ashamed to go home. After the hospital does not want to know about his injuries, Timofei takes the young lad home. Despite having no social graces, he has the energy of a puppy and a charm that soon has Tomofei fixated on him. Vera on the other hand is not best pleased and what happens next is a riot of hormones, emotions, water fights, more food than you can shake a stick at and some very bruised hearts.This is filmed inventively making the most of how we see what we see in different ways, which is actually unnecessary as there is so much on screen action to hold your attention. Uloomji is so likeable that you can't help but fall for him too, it is how he inspires everyone around him - except his family that holds the whole thing together, That said there is not one single below average performance, all the extras are great and the jokes work even if you do not speak much Russian.This film is so good that I am going to buy a copy as I had rented this and if I could give more than five stars I would. It is 83 minutes long which is my only complaint I could have watched this stuff all day long, but it does not waste any screen time so that has to be applauded, one of the best films I have seen in ages and I can only recommend.",5,"Russian M&eacute;nage a Trois, Comdey Romp with Nose licking, Tea Ceremonies and Animal Suits!",1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,1908,"['was', 'not', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'Russian', 'gay', 'comedy', 'so', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'not', 'rude', 'sense', 'mind', 'how', 'great', 'actually', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'three', 'people', 'meet', 'Tomofei', 'Evgeniy', 'Korayakoviskiy', 'advertising', 'executive', 'who', 'strange', 'Cola', 'anchor', 'woman', 'Vera', 'Krillova', 'sort', 'fall', 'other', 'right', 'away', 'penchant', 'food', 'aphrodisiac', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'Cockney', 'phrase', 'apples', 'pears', 'get', 'drift.Anyway', 'accidentally', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'Uloomji', 'who', 'living', 'Zoo', 'having', 'failed', 'get', 'college', 'too', 'ashamed', 'go', 'home', 'hospital', 'not', 'want', 'know', 'injuries', 'Timofei', 'young', 'lad', 'home', 'having', 'social', 'graces', 'energy', 'puppy', 'charm', 'soon', 'Tomofei', 'fixated', 'Vera', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'best', 'pleased', 'what', 'next', 'riot', 'hormones', 'emotions', 'water', 'fights', 'more', 'food', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'very', 'bruised', 'hearts.This', 'filmed', 'inventively', 'making', 'most', 'how', 'see', 'what', 'see', 'different', 'ways', 'actually', 'unnecessary', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'action', 'hold', 'attention', 'Uloomji', 'so', 'likeable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'too', 'how', 'everyone', 'family', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'said', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'average', 'performance', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'jokes', 'work', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'much', 'Russian.This', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'am', 'going', 'buy', 'copy', 'had', 'rented', 'could', 'give', 'more', 'five', 'stars', 'would', '83', 'minutes', 'long', 'only', 'complaint', 'could', 'have', 'watched', 'stuff', 'day', 'long', 'not', 'waste', 'screen', 'time', 'be', 'applauded', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'ages', 'can', 'only', 'recommend']",You I Love
