Also, shouldn't these shows be in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio of British television?  A@E persists in putting everything into American fullscreen mode.  It didn't bother me too much with The Prisoner and The Avengers, but many jokes in Benny Hill begin with seeing a billboard or movie credit read one way, only to have it read something else when the camera pulls back.  Such jokes are ruined if the show isn't in its original aspect ratio.  Would it kill A@E to give us the choice?Still, at least these shows represent something like completeness.

Benny Hill is young, surprisingly slender in these shows and full of vitality, and energy missing from his twilight shows some twenty years later.Here we can see the entire 'Benny Hill Show' special as it appeared on Thames Television in Great Britain, completely unedited.  The shows boast first-rate musical numbers usually performed by Benny's in-house quartet of female singers, the Ladybirds, and Hill's brilliant comedy.  American viewers will recognize some of the sketches, but be astonished as to how much material was edited out for American syndication, primarily for time considerations.I always loved the delightful, and hilarious sketch, 'The European Song Of The Year Contest', which is in the very first special of the 11 included on this three-disc set. Here the sketch has several more contestants added, and a finale that was always deleted from the USA version.  Even the order of the scenes in the sketches was juggled by the American editor!  There are really only a few moments where a skit or gag was dropped because of raciness or poor taste.There are also three black & white specials included on this set that were never broadcast in any form to American television, as USA audiences are generally loathe to watch anything not in color!What is also remarkable about these broadcasts is that the beautiful women on the show clearly take a backseat to comedy and music!

832458,A176IA89VGH46M,B0002F6AHA,Todd Bovair,"[24, 25]","Most Americans were introduced to Benny Hill in the very late '70s/ early '80's as a syndicated program sold to independent stations called ""The Benny Hill Show"". This show was a compilation of sorts- bits and pieces of Benny's Thames TV specials (which averaged about once a month in England) were assembled as episodes for American TV. The skits that involved regional UK humor, very thick British accents, and the 'celebrity' musical acts were generally left out- only skits 'acceptable' for American audiences were included (oddly enough, the bawdy humor and even nudity were deemed 'acceptable'!).Now, A&E; have released Benny's Thames specials complete and uncut. Some may find these a bit unsettling, as some skits can scarcely be understood (due to thick accents and material referencing UK personas little-known to Americans) and the 'celebrity' musical/dancing guests leave much to be desired. Still, these are the specials that the American Benny Hill Show was culled from, and should be of great interest to any Benny Hill fan.Season one is NOT the Benny Hill you may remember. This set comprises the specials from 1969-1971, so this was pretty early on. While their are hints of the bawdy humor that would become Benny's trademark, the humor in this set is quite tame really. That shouldn't keep any Benny fans from viewing this set though, as Benny's wit is razor sharp here. Clever comedy songs (as always), Benny's double entendres (when they were still original!), and funny slapstick skits are all here for your enjoyment. This is where Benny really started to become the comedian that is a worldwide legend. While later seasons would become more risque (much to the delight of Benny fans everywhere), season one offers a glimpse of a comedian who sparkles with originality and enthusiasm. That alone is worth checking out season one for.A&E; has done a great job with these DVD sets. The picture looks as good as it did when these specials were originally broadcast, and releasing these sets UNCUT is especially appreciated by all hardcore Benny fans. My one complaint with these sets (and it is a MAJOR one) is that there are NO SUBTITLES! Much of the show involves thick English accents. While I am very practiced in deciphering these, I'm sure many Americans are going to have great difficulty understanding what is being said (especially important since a lot of Benny's humor is very nuanced, like the extensive use of double entendres). Please A&E;, subtitle all future sets! Still, if you can understand the dialogue (it comes with practice), this is a good set to begin your Benny Hill experience.By the way, if you are one of those humorless people who think Benny is just an unfunny 'dirty old man': GET A LIFE. I'm sure you make everyone around you miserable with your pathetic lack of humor (and why are you here reading this, anyway?).

It's wonderful to see these shows in their original format, with lots of material that was never spliced into the US half-hour shows.  For example, the first episode has a brilliant sendup of the Eurovision song contest which I don't recall having seen before - they probably left it off the US shows thinking that we wouldn't get the joke.Also, most of the songs and recitations from the hilarious ""Words and Music"" LP are featured in these shows, including Benny's only hit single, ""Ernie,"" which debuted on one of the black and white episodes.Fans of the great BBC radio game show ""Just a Minute"" will be interested that chairman Nicholas Parsons appears as Benny's straight man in the early shows- the role later taken over by Henry McGee.I'm putting in my order now for volume two.",5,Great stuff,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,855,"['cost', 'set', 'best', 'money', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'recently', 'wonderful', 'see', 'shows', 'original', 'format', 'lots', 'material', 'was', 'never', 'spliced', 'US', 'half-hour', 'shows', 'example', 'first', 'episode', 'brilliant', 'sendup', 'Eurovision', 'song', 'contest', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'having', 'seen', 'probably', 'left', 'off', 'US', 'thinking', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'joke.Also', 'most', 'songs', 'recitations', 'hilarious', 'Words', 'Music', 'LP', 'are', 'featured', 'shows', 'including', 'Benny', 'only', 'hit', 'single', 'Ernie', 'debuted', 'one', 'black', 'white', 'episodes.Fans', 'great', 'BBC', 'radio', 'game', 'show', 'Just', 'Minute', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'chairman', 'Nicholas', 'Parsons', 'Benny', 'straight', 'man', 'early', 'shows-', 'role', 'later', 'taken', 'over', 'Henry', 'McGee.I', ""'m"", 'putting', 'order', 'now', 'volume', 'two']","Benny Hill Complete and Unadulterated: The Naughty Early Years, Set One - 1969-1971"
