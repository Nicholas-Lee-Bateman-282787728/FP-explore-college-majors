1354004,A1GY9NQLUPB7OA,B003M8NGKS,"Sam I am ""Claire Harts""","[3, 6]","This movie is really great! It reminds me of Mean Girls.  The school year begins with an annual rushing event that happens in order to start off the sorority and fraternity functions.  Katy Parker is a freshman in college and her and her bestfriend are rushing as well, but of course nothing goes as planned when Katy reveals a secret about the head girl of a popular sorority.  A sorority that very much expressed a great desire to have her.  The battles begin.  The main character Katie Parker; who is played by Lucy Hale, is a great actress and she plays the fighting heroine who's so desperately seeking justice when the odds are against her.  Two sororities collide and battle it out in this non-stop rivalry driven college tale.  I definitely recommend, FUN, FUN, FUNNNN movie! :D",5,Pretty Good,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,786,"['movie', 'really', 'great', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'school', 'year', 'annual', 'rushing', 'event', 'order', 'start', 'off', 'sorority', 'fraternity', 'functions', 'Katy', 'Parker', 'freshman', 'college', 'bestfriend', 'are', 'rushing', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'nothing', 'as', 'planned', 'when', 'Katy', 'secret', 'head', 'girl', 'popular', 'sorority', 'sorority', 'very', 'much', 'expressed', 'great', 'desire', 'have', 'battles', 'begin', 'main', 'character', 'Katie', 'Parker', 'who', 'played', 'Lucy', 'Hale', 'great', 'actress', 'fighting', 'heroine', 'who', 'so', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'justice', 'when', 'odds', 'are', 'Two', 'sororities', 'collide', 'battle', 'out', 'non-stop', 'rivalry', 'driven', 'college', 'tale', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'FUN', 'FUN', 'FUNNNN', 'movie', 'D']",N/A
