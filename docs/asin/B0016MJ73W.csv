Instead of catching it here and there on reruns, it's now in one space saving box.This show is a surefire nostalgia tweak when I remember Raj, Rerun and Dwayne and their mischief-making ways.

1154287,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B0016MJ73W,Sylviastel,"[1, 1]","This DVD collection features all of the episodes from the three seasons on network television. The sitcom is inspired by Cooley High and I don't honestly know what that was or is. I do remember watching ""What's Happening!"" in syndication in the 1980s when local stations still reran sitcoms to fill the daytime slots. The show is set in urban Los Angeles, California with a gang of three best guy friends, Raj (Ernest Thomas); Dwayne (Haywood Nelson); and Rerun (Fred Berry). Raj has a younger bratty sister, Dee (Danielle Spencer) and their parents were divorced. Divorce was still a taboo topic until the 1980s in mainstream society. The series also featured the wonderful Mabel King (Navin's adopted mother in the film, ""The Jerk) and Shirley Hemphill (waitress at Rob's Place where the gang hangs out).The sitcom tackled serious issues even in it's day. Raj was an aspiring writer while going to high school and working at the supermarket. This sitcom had a mother figure in both Mabel King and Shirley Hemphill. I'll never understand why the producers allowed Mabel King to leave the show. Supposedly, she was like Esther Rolle (Florida from Good Times) who insisted that there was a father figure in the series. Even though with divorce, Mr. Thomas played a part and reunited with his estranged children.What's Happening! lasted only three seasons. I would have liked to have been more but the producers had other ideas for the show. We never saw Rerun or Dwayne's parents on the series for example. We watched Rerun and Raj move into their own place and have their own adventures. Still, money was a subject of not having enough in hard times in the 1970s. The cast is likable especially Shirley Hemphill who would take over the motherly role by moving into Mama Thomas's house, pay rent, and help raise Dee in the house.Still despite the departure of Mabel King which I never could understand and still don't, the show bounced back and had memorable episodes like the Doobie brothers in a two part episode. I just watched the touching Christmas episode where the kids' father invites them over for Christmas dinner but Mabel doesn't feel comfortable to mention that she was given the day off. There are episodes that tackled pressing issues for teens especially African Americans in the 1970s Los Angeles, California.",4,The Show Wasn't the Same without Mama!,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,2325,"['DVD', 'collection', 'episodes', 'three', 'seasons', 'network', 'television', 'sitcom', 'inspired', 'Cooley', 'High', 'do', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'do', 'remember', 'watching', 'What', 'Happening', 'syndication', '1980s', 'when', 'local', 'stations', 'still', 'reran', 'sitcoms', 'fill', 'daytime', 'slots', 'show', 'set', 'urban', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California', 'gang', 'three', 'best', 'guy', 'friends', 'Raj', 'Ernest', 'Thomas', 'Dwayne', 'Haywood', 'Nelson', 'Rerun', 'Fred', 'Berry', 'Raj', 'younger', 'bratty', 'sister', 'Dee', 'Danielle', 'Spencer', 'parents', 'were', 'divorced', 'Divorce', 'was', 'still', 'taboo', 'topic', '1980s', 'mainstream', 'society', 'series', 'also', 'featured', 'wonderful', 'Mabel', 'King', 'Navin', 'adopted', 'mother', 'film', 'Jerk', 'Shirley', 'Hemphill', 'waitress', 'Rob', 'Place', 'where', 'gang', 'out', '.The', 'sitcom', 'tackled', 'serious', 'issues', 'even', 'day', 'Raj', 'was', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'going', 'high', 'school', 'working', 'supermarket', 'sitcom', 'had', 'mother', 'figure', 'Mabel', 'King', 'Shirley', 'Hemphill', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'producers', 'allowed', 'Mabel', 'King', 'leave', 'show', 'Supposedly', 'was', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'Florida', 'Good', 'Times', 'who', 'insisted', 'was', 'father', 'figure', 'series', 'Even', 'divorce', 'Mr.', 'Thomas', 'played', 'part', 'reunited', 'estranged', 'children.What', 'Happening', 'lasted', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'producers', 'had', 'other', 'ideas', 'show', 'never', 'saw', 'Rerun', 'Dwayne', 'parents', 'series', 'example', 'watched', 'Rerun', 'Raj', 'move', 'own', 'place', 'have', 'own', 'adventures', 'Still', 'money', 'was', 'subject', 'not', 'having', 'enough', 'hard', 'times', '1970s', 'cast', 'likable', 'especially', 'Shirley', 'Hemphill', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'motherly', 'role', 'moving', 'Mama', 'Thomas', 'house', 'pay', 'rent', 'help', 'raise', 'Dee', 'house.Still', 'departure', 'Mabel', 'King', 'never', 'could', 'understand', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'bounced', 'back', 'had', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'Doobie', 'brothers', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'just', 'watched', 'touching', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'where', 'kids', 'father', 'over', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'Mabel', ""n't"", 'feel', 'comfortable', 'mention', 'was', 'given', 'day', 'off', 'are', 'episodes', 'tackled', 'pressing', 'issues', 'teens', 'especially', 'African', 'Americans', '1970s', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California']",What's Happening: The Complete Series
