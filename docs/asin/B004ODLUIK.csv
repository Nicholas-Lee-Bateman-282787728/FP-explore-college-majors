She and Luke Arnold did not disappoint me in this story.  They played these rebel teenagers that get in trouble but what comes out of that is beautiful and inspiring music.

It shows what can be done if you keep your focus and don't give up on yourself or your dream. It reminds me in some ways of the movie &#34;August Rush&#34; because the star heard music in everything from tools to nature.",5,Great message with feel good ending,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,414,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'awesome', 'music', 'one', 'also', 'main', 'star', 'held', 'dream', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'including', 'father', 'not', 'believing', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'keep', 'focus', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'dream', 'ways', 'movie', '34', 'August', 'Rush', '34', 'star', 'heard', 'music', 'everything', 'tools', 'nature']",N/A
