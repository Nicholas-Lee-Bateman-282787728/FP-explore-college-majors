This movie lived, somewhat, up to the hype (to my shagrin).  I thought it would be terrible as a result of too much publicity  &amp; merchandising.  But I was wrong. Didn't pay too much attention to the  storyline to condemn or commend it, but action/comedy-wise, it was a '99  contender for best movie of the year (with a cool Smith song to boot).  Smith &amp; Kline are like Brains &amp;... Ego, but Smith entertains with  action/wit, Kline humourously comes up with inventions of modern-day  America, and Salma Hayek... is brought in to, merely, look good.  It's bold  in the end when West &amp; Gordon realize that she's married to an old man,  let alone... married at all!  After all the previous good-natured sparring  between West &amp; Gordon on who has more appeal to her.  Highlights of the  film are &quot;Jim West in the descending water tower,&quot; &quot;Artemus  Gordon's sick humour,&quot; &quot;West's impending hanging amongst the  gallows for blunderheadely, but unintentionally insulting a white  woman,&quot; &quot;West's gypsy act to throw off no-legs Arliss  Loveless,&quot; &quot;the magnetic neck-braces/jump into the mud,&quot;  &quot;Artemus' beguiling impersonation of Ulysses S. Grant,&quot; &amp;  &quot;the big Tarantula-bot fight scene with Loveless, yep... he died  (well-deserved).&quot;  When it comes down to it, Smith did a pretty good  job without a stunt double (in 90% of the fighting).  Still doesn't live up  to &quot;Men In Black&quot; &amp; &quot;Independence Day,&quot; but  certainly no chump in comparison.  In short, a barrell-o'-guns... a blast!

It performed well below the expectations at the box-office, and rightly so. &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is filled with uninspired and obvious gags, even  worse, it is not at all funny. This is all the more astonishing since it  stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline and the beautiful Salma Hayek. All of them  proofed to be capable comic actors in previous pictures. Director Barry  Sonnenfeld was also known as a man with a freaky sense of humor (&quot;Men  in Black&quot; and &quot;Adams Family&quot; weren't great films, but at  least succeeded in entertaining the audience).Unfortunately, they don't  score big this time. The special effects are good, but the whole films  appears overproduced and the actors seem to wear signs around the necks  which say what is funny about them.&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is an  example for soulless, uninspired fimmaking (as was &quot;ID4&quot;,  &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Armageddon&quot;).

512479,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00001ZWTS,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","I believe it was Wild Wild West starring Will Smith that my cousin took me to the movie theater to watch back in 1999.  I had fun at the movie theater, but didn't think much of the movie.At first I couldn't believe it- Will Smith in a movie like this?  Growing up a minor fan of his extremely popular hit TV show Fresh Prince, I didn't think Will Smith had a CHANCE in Hollywood back in 1999 when he made the switch to movies after the show had ended.  This is the movie that made me question Will's decision to attempt movie roles.Luckily, Will Smith ended up making good movies after Wild Wild West, but this was certainly NOT a good movie.  I remember having fun at the movie theater the day my cousin took me there, but now I remember why I didn't care for the movie.For one thing, every single predictable thing you can possibly imagine about adventure movies is probably featured here, and since every storyline twist is so predictable and boring in the film, you know what's going to happen almost every single time.  This is inexcusable to me.The writing in Wild Wild West is absolutely bland.  It's not funny either.  I get the feeling the movie is trying to be like Indiana Jones with the style of adventure and light comedy bits, but almost *none* of it makes me smile, laugh, or even feel enticed enough to finish watching the film.  I don't even know if the jokes are just not funny, or if the film is more aimed towards children.The joke about the guy dressing up as a woman wasn't very good because it was taken a bit too seriously and used too much as a joke to fall back on more throughout the movie.Will Smith himself wasn't funny either.  His character was really good, but when he tried mixing comedy with the shooting scenes, it didn't work.It feels like a movie that could have had promise had the writing been better.Well it certainly LOOKS like a good movie going by late 90's film standards and Hollywood effects and whatnot.  Wild Wild West ends up being the biggest disappointment you could ever imagine.  Adventure movies are not supposed to be boring.  At least to me, it's extremely hard to find something negative about most adventure movies that attempt more or less the same thing this movie did.

Many times I rushed home from school to see the latest episode... So I eagerly awaited the release of the new movie onto video. (Yes, I waited a while to write my review.)I must admit, I was a bit disappointed... but mostly because I know how good the original series was.In the movie Will Smith is a questionable choice for the role of James West.  In the TV series, James West was a man with a cocky attitude and a reputation with the ladies, but Will Smith goes slightly overboard.  Smith does have a tendancy to bring his own brand of low humor to his movies (although &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; showed his real talent as an actor), and it almost seems as if Smith is starring in the movie as HIMSELF, not James West.Kevin Kline, on the other hand, performed a wonderfully accurate rendition of the Artemus Gordon character of the TV show.  And all the costumes and gadgets that Artemus was known for in the series are here in the movie as well... including the tricked-out James Bond-style steam locomotive!The villan's plot is even wilder than ever, thanks to modern Hollywood special effects.  Although a 80 foot tall mechanical spider might be hard to believe, the TV series was equally unbelievable at times.The begining of the movie was a bit hard to follow... but the story becomes clearer as the film progresses, and introduces some drama at points, while keeping a sense of humor.In short, it is a disappointment compared to the long-late &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; TV show... but not bad as a movie.  Even though it doesn't live up to the expectation of it's inspiration, it won't disappoint those who haven't grown up with the TV version.The end of the movie seems to suggest there might be a sequel in the works...

Capt. James 'Jim' West (Will Smith) and Artemus 'Artie' Gordon (Kevin Kline) soon find out who it is -- the evil Dr. Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), a freaky genius with no legs. (Seriously, he has no legs) His intention: Take over the USA.Are our heroes going to stop him? You betcha.

Unfortunately, that sort of stuff is only fun the first time.When Sonnenfield is good, he's very very good. Here, he is not good. The level of stupid jokes and idiotic slapstick is mind-boggling, and the few attempts at character development (like West talking about his past) fall flat on their faces.

S., more or less, in about the mid-1800s. Rather than consider it a story, I'd have to regard it as about 90 minutes of assorted absurdities. Some are humorous. Following the story, if there is one, is nearly impossible, but if you want to watch it for odd jokes, strange lines, visual puns and widely assorted gadgetry, it's actually  amusing. enjoyable and entertaining. The gadgets, in particular, are rather clever and some of them are hilariously funny. How Hollywood ever puts these things together are beyond my understanding. And it obviously had to have major funding. The acting wasn't bad if you can get by with the absurdity. The filming and soundtrack are excellent. The story?

512517,A7Y6AVS576M03,B00001ZWTS,gobirds2,"[1, 8]","WILD WILD WEST is one of the first films to take full advantage of the DVD format. From a visual standpoint, seeing this film initially in the theatre I just felt that too much emphasis was placed on special effects (which are now mostly computer generated) and development of the story and characters was sacrificed to this end. Subconsciously the viewer knows that many of these effects no matter how realistic they look can not be photographed because there is really no vantage point to place the camera. Our minds are just too sophisticated to accept this especially when seen on the large silver screen in a theatre. Somehow on TV these effects just seem more acceptable and palatable.  Perhaps it is all those commercials that are now filled with CG effects and proliferate our TV sets. In any event WILD WILD WEST looks great on TV and putting aside all the special effects it plays out as a very entertaining Western made from the same mold as the original TV series. It's basically a story of two secret service agents  (Will Smith and Kevin Kline) who report to President Grant. They travel by way of their own personal railway car and locomotive across the country pitting their talents against a villain (Kenneth Branagh as Dr. Arliss Loveless) who utilizes Twentieth Century technology in an attempt to conquer and rule the West. Director Barry Sonnenfeld has taken this format but now pits our two heroes against each other to see who will win the girl (Salma Hayek) and who ultimately get Loveless by the end of the film. This is a similar plot device that Sergio Leone used in successfully in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. As Will Smith and Kevin Kline develop in their roles they learn that they must combine their talents to defeat Loveless. Kenneth Branagh gives a brilliant performance as the devious and twisted Dr. Loveless that somehow strengthens the resolve of both Smith and Kline. There are some great moments in this film of action, surprise, comedy and bravado. All this is enhanced by Elmer Bernstein's first rousing Western score in years. Despite the science fiction elements Bernstein focuses his score on the West and Dr. Loveless' post Civil War Southern homestead. As for Will Smith's great performance of the WILD WILD WEST theme song, you can hear that over the closing credits and on the complete version of his music video included on this DVD. I thought this was a very enjoyable film. I have watched it several times.

Don't mess with an established genre. And yes I'm well aware that this was the 90's and that movie producers had so run out of ideas that they felt they had to try and redo every movie that was ever made prior. I mean nothing racist about this when I say that it was a mistake to sign a Black actor to play this part. The traditional character of James west was played by Robert Conrad - a white actor. When they signed Will Smith they inadvertently made it a &quot;Black&quot; film and by doing so thus alienated a large part of their viewing audience. Its not that the fans were racist(although I'm sure some of them were) but you see when you remake a classic of any sort, you not only have to sell your product to the ever consuming adolescent masses, but also to at least some of the old fans to make it work. When they changed the color of the starring actor, they basically departed from the original so much that they were in effect making a movie that had nothing to do with &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;.

(apparently it's a moot point that THE MATRIX is a convoluted, headache-inducing mess, whereas whatever else you wanna say about WILD WILD WEST, at least it makes sense.)the film reunites Smith with MEN IN BLACK director Barry Sonnenfeld and, despite what the brainwashed would have you believe, lightning struck twice! sure it's cheesy, but it's supposed to be cheese!! (besides, i never heard anyone accuse the tv series of being a painstaking researched accuracy.) it effortlessly pulls off the tricky maneuver of counterbalancing whimsy and suspense. Smith has no less chemistry with Kevin Kline than he had with former (and future) co-star Tommy Lee Jones, and Kenneth Branaugh makes for as charistmatic yet forboding a villain as any you'll ever see. the film is worth seeing if only for those two. neither Kline nor Branaugh does this sort of film very often, and both are clearly having a blast with the break from their usual routine.there is a mitigating circumstance which may have some significance. despite the fact that most of my favorite American television series come from that period, i've never had any massive enthusiasm for the WILD WILD WEST tv show. obviously the premise of Bondesque spies in the West had the potential to be pretty cool, but in actual practice i never felt any magic from it. and i never found Robert Conrad's portrayal particularly engaging. does that have something to do with the fact that i'm one of the few to recommend the film? that's more than i can say, but go ahead and think so if it makes any sense out of the situation for you.either way, the point i started out to make still stands: is it really so hard to tune out the juggernaught so you can judge a film on it's own merits? it's never been for me, but alas, judging from every other review of this maligned charmer, the unfortunate phenomenon of people finding it easier to submit to the flow than to take the time and trouble to formulate their own opinion - the very phenomenon that got Hitler into office - is depressingly alive and well.",5,"The Greatest Film Ever To ""Win"" A Razzie...",1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,3748,"['time', 'time', 'i', ""'ve"", 'toyed', 'idea', 'career', 'movie', 'critic', 'alas', 'fun', 'i', ""'ve"", 'been', 'having', 'expressing', 'inner', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'here', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'i', ""'d"", 'never', 'make', 'cut', ""'d"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'teach', 'profession', 'foremost', 'rule', 'namely', 'comedies', 'fantasies', 'technically', 'known', 'fun', 'necessary', 'movies', 'are', 'utterly', 'beneath', 'contempt', 'one', 'token', 'specimen', 'fun/necessary', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'hat', 'month', 'so', 'one', 'may', 'praise', 'so', 'moved', 'rest', 'are', 'be', 'regarded', 'deliberately', 'malicious', 'attacks', 'personally', 'such', 'cut', 'NO', 'SLACK', 'WHATSOEVER', 'whereas', 'dramas', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'Real', 'World', 'technically', 'known', 'boring', 'pointless', 'movies', 'are', 'sacredest', 'sacred', 'cows', 'rare', 'occasion', 'boring/pointless', 'movie', 'not', 'such', 'quite', 'snuff', 'receive', 'only', 'mildest', 'most', 'businesslike', 'slap', 'wrist', 'ifit', 'were', 'nothing', 'personal', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'what', 'method', 'use', 'adjust', 'someone', 'mind', 'askew', 'condition', 'i', 'have', 'sneaking', 'suspicion', 'was', 'created', 'Dr.', 'Josef', 'Mengela.WILD', 'WILD', 'WEST', 'textbook', 'example', 'sort', 'film', 'delivers', 'spades', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'arcane', 'system', 'twisted', 'reason', 'Fates', 'settled', 'delightful', 'film', 'set', 'wolfpack', 'loose', 'juggernaught', 'was', 'so', 'ruthless', 'fact', 'Will', 'Smith', 'was', 'successfully', 'browbeaten', 'apologizing', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'supposedly', 'bastardizing', 'signature', 'character', 'certain', 'class', 'person', 'intending', 'insult', 'point', 'out', 'Smith', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hit', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'instead', 'bomb', 'apparently', 'moot', 'point', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'convoluted', 'headache-inducing', 'mess', 'whereas', 'else', 'wan', 'na', 'say', 'WILD', 'WILD', 'WEST', 'least', 'sense', 'film', 'Smith', 'MEN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'director', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'what', 'brainwashed', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'lightning', 'struck', 'twice', 'sure', 'cheesy', 'supposed', 'be', 'cheese', 'i', 'never', 'heard', 'anyone', 'tv', 'series', 'being', 'painstaking', 'researched', 'accuracy', 'effortlessly', 'tricky', 'maneuver', 'counterbalancing', 'whimsy', 'suspense', 'Smith', 'less', 'chemistry', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'had', 'former', 'future', 'co-star', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'charistmatic', 'yet', 'forboding', 'villain', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'film', 'seeing', 'only', 'two', 'Kline', 'Branaugh', 'sort', 'film', 'very', 'often', 'are', 'clearly', 'having', 'blast', 'break', 'usual', 'routine.there', 'mitigating', 'circumstance', 'may', 'have', 'significance', 'fact', 'most', 'favorite', 'American', 'television', 'series', 'come', 'period', 'i', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'massive', 'enthusiasm', 'WILD', 'WILD', 'WEST', 'tv', 'show', 'obviously', 'premise', 'Bondesque', 'spies', 'West', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'pretty', 'cool', 'actual', 'practice', 'i', 'never', 'felt', 'magic', 'i', 'never', 'found', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'portrayal', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'fact', ""'m"", 'one', 'few', 'recommend', 'film', 'more', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'go', 'ahead', 'think', 'so', 'sense', 'situation', 'you.either', 'way', 'point', 'i', 'started', 'out', 'make', 'still', 'stands', 'really', 'so', 'hard', 'tune', 'out', 'juggernaught', 'can', 'judge', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'never', 'been', 'alas', 'judging', 'other', 'review', 'maligned', 'charmer', 'unfortunate', 'phenomenon', 'people', 'finding', 'easier', 'submit', 'flow', 'take', 'time', 'trouble', 'formulate', 'own', 'opinion', 'very', 'phenomenon', 'got', 'Hitler', 'office', 'depressingly', 'alive', 'well']",Wild Wild West VHS

512541,A1KVO275MBQIVN,B00001ZWTS,K. Johnson,"[4, 5]","This movie gets a lot of grief, and it's easy to see why.  A TV show from the childhoods an entire generation (it was made in the 1960s and syndicated as a rerun in the 1970s) is made into a movie at a time when the show is not fresh in anyone's minds nor readily available on home video.  The generation remembers adventure in the Old West with a James Bond twist, great production values and characters who were super cool.  Yes, that generation is right, but in the years that have passed, they forgot (like the makers of some of the recent James Bond movies) what made the show so much fun.  It never took itself quite seriously.With The Wild Wild West available on DVD now, it's still cool to hate the movie and love the TV series even if you've never watched it or haven't since the 70s.  Well, I'm not going to comment on the collective's ability to dismiss what is a perfectly fun movie as trash while having no recent memory of the show the movie is based on.  What I am going to say is that Wild Wild West actually does a great job of bringing the spirit of the 1960s TV show to a modern audience.  If there hadn't been so much belly-aching when it came out, it could have started a new generation loving the old show.  Of course, Robert Conrad's outspoken criticism of the movie didn't help.I am a big (read: freaking huge) fan of The Wild Wild West.  It combined the adventure of the Old West with the intrigue and suspense of James Bond.  The main attraction, of course, is the playful relationship between Jim West and Artemus Gordon (or, if you're a woman with simple tastes, Robert Conrad's sculpted behind in tight pants).  Each episode had a similar structure - Jim and Artie have to protect someone or something, that someone or something is stolen or kidnapped, they track down the culprit who turns out to be a lunatic with some strange idea of taking over the country or the world, Jim goes in with guns blazing and gets captured, Artie goes in with a disguise and breaks Jim out, then they both get captured and put in an elaborate death trap from which they escape using their genius and Artie's gadgetry, and, in the end, Jim gets the girl while Artie is left to make the coffee on the Wanderer (their train).  Each episode had its own take on that format, but that was sort of the standard plot.Artie's gadgets on the show were usually simple - buttons that burned through wood, a derringer on a rail in Jim's sleeve, glasses that allow one to see certain chemicals.  The villains had more elaborate displays - a bubbling machine that runs on the brains of geniuses, a giant flamethrower cannon, and various death traps that used lightning or solar energy.  The king lunatic of their enemies was the resourceful Dr. Loveless, played by the absolutely irreplaceable Michael Dunn.While there was no way a movie without Robert Conrad, Ross Martin, and Michael Dunn could entirely capture the spirit of the original show, the writers made an honest attempt.  In fact, besides the obvious story arc similarities, there were numerous references to the TV show including Selma Hayek's story which matches a first-season episode in which the main woman (Chinese rather than Mexican) turns out to be married.  Some of the gadgetry from the show appears in the film.  Dr. Loveless is probably the strangest deviation from the original show with his exaggerated southern accent and missing bottom half of his body rather than simply short stature.  The main criticisms most people have of the film are that it had too many one-liners and a lot of over-the-top machines.  As for the one-liners... the original show is full of them!  Jim and Artie make bad puns constantly, and Jim delivers one-liners with the gusto of the worst of James Bond (but still retains his awesome dignity because he's freaking Robert Conrad).  The machines were simply a product of modern movie-making.  The gadgetry of the original show would seem incredibly tame to modern audiences because it was stuff that could be built easily and quickly (and cheaply) for many episodes in one season.  In a movie, you can make a lot of big stuff or animate a lot of big stuff, so they did.  And all of the gadgets are pretty darn cool-looking, even the bemoaned giant spider.  It's funny, but at the time the movie came out, another movie came out called Atlantis: The Lost Empire.  This Disney vehicle was also criticized for being strange.  Yet, today people have realized that it was actually a neat movie because that steampunk aesthetic caught on.Sadly, no one will accept that over-the-top steampunk look in Wild Wild West because they're too busy comparing it to their finest memories of the Wild Wild West TV show, and that's too bad because it's a fun movie.  Hey, whatever floats your boat, but don't go telling me that I shouldn't be having fun watching something I like.",3,"Actually, it's kind of fun",1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,4864,"['movie', 'lot',

512542,A2O6JWJS6EEI6D,B00001ZWTS,"L. Camuti ""moviequeen""","[0, 1]","OK, being an AVID fan of the original TV series, I was skeptical at best when I first heard that Smith and Kline were cast in the main roles. I like  both these actors, yet I couldn't envision Kevin Kline pulling off Ross  Martin's character. Was I ever surprised! What I really liked about this  film was that Kline did a fabulous job of portraying the quirky genious of  Artemus Gordon. And though the writers took a different tack on Dr.  Loveless' half-stature (albeit Arliss instead of Miguelito), it was  effective. Both Kline and Branaugh's characters tapped into that sense of  inventors of the fantastic that was evident in the series. After all, the  original wasn't a far cry from &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; meets &quot;The  Twilight Zone&quot;. Even the scene where Loveless is spinning around in  his wheelchair at his New Orleans party was reminiscent of the reckless  abandon of Miguelito Loveless.Still, the only thing Will Smith had in  common with Robert Conrad is that they are both hunks who look great in  Western outfitting. It's obvious that Smith is meant to draw the  contemporary audience, while in my mind, sacrificing the believability of  West by defying historical probability. Come on, that scene at the party  where he breaks down the meaning of &quot;redneck&quot; for the guests is  ridiculous. The best aspect of Will's character is his banter with  Branaugh's Loveless, again true to the original.Overall, this isn't a  great movie, but it is fun. For those old enough to remember the series, I  think there are some elements that hold up. For the younger crowd, you may  well find it silly, but it's worth a look.",3,"Kline, Branaugh connect to the essence of the original",965088000,"08 1, 2000",2000,1644,"['OK', 'being', 'AVID', 'fan', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'skeptical', 'best', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'Smith', 'Kline', 'were', 'cast', 'main', 'roles', 'actors', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'envision', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'pulling', 'off', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'character', 'Was', 'ever', 'surprised', 'What', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'Kline', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'portraying', 'quirky', 'genious', 'Artemus', 'Gordon', 'writers', 'took', 'different', 'tack', 'Dr.', 'Loveless', 'half-stature', 'Arliss', 'instead', 'Miguelito', 'was', 'effective', 'Kline', 'Branaugh', 'characters', 'tapped', 'sense', 'inventors', 'fantastic', 'was', 'evident', 'series', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'far', 'cry', 'quot', 'Gunsmoke', 'quot', 'meets', 'quot', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'quot', 'Even', 'scene', 'where', 'Loveless', 'spinning', 'around', 'wheelchair', 'New', 'Orleans', 'party', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'Miguelito', 'Loveless.Still', 'only', 'thing', 'Will', 'Smith', 'had', 'common', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'are', 'hunks', 'who', 'look', 'great', 'Western', 'outfitting', 'obvious', 'Smith', 'meant', 'draw', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'mind', 'sacrificing', 'believability', 'West', 'defying', 'historical', 'probability', 'Come', 'scene', 'party', 'where', 'down', 'meaning', 'quot', 'redneck', 'quot', 'guests', 'ridiculous', 'best', 'aspect', 'Will', 'character', 'banter', 'Branaugh', 'Loveless', 'again', 'true', 'original.Overall', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'fun', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'series', 'think', 'are', 'elements', 'hold', 'up', 'younger', 'crowd', 'may', 'well', 'find', 'silly', 'look']",Wild Wild West VHS
512543,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00001ZWTS,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[25, 32]","In the mid-60s there was a show called ""Wild Wild West"" that starred Robert Conrad as James ""Jim"" West, a western version of James Bond, and Ross Martin as his brainy sidekick Artemus Gordon.  This show was creative and intelligent and yet full of action.  The movie ""Wild Wild West"" starring Will Smith and Kevin Kline has nothing to do with that television show, unfortunately.Will Smith is another Jim West and Kevin Kline is another Artemus Gordon in an alternate universe that never existed.  In this universe the Wright brothers apparently were asleep as Artemus and Jim were tooling around a giant steam-powered iron spider that is unlikely to exist in any imaginable reality.  Indeed, the only point of any vague historical accuracy is that there was a President Grant and there was a meeting of the railroads.  After that, this movie is ""The Twilight Zone"" in the west.In this fantasy movie Kenneth Branagh plays Dr. Loveless.  Once again, forget the wonderful Michael Dunn as the original Dr. Loveless.  Branagh has none of the charm and wit of the original.  Dr. Loveless has decided to create his own empire based on the ability of his giant spider to trounce anyone who gets in his way.  However, he seemed to have neglected to consider that an open cockpit is a sure way to eventually be shot.  Along the way we see a number of other equally improbable devices that make for interesting special effects but continual disappointment with the movie.I have yet to mention that not only is this west some bizarre fantasy version of the original west, but this version of Jim West has a continual string of one-liners that would have allowed him to do stand-up, but not in the alternate reality of this movie where no one seemed to understand his jokes, often including the audience.  Kevin Kline also had a number of humorous lines, though his were more ironic and involved, and typically based on technology that exists only in the alternate reality of this world.This movie does have its moments.  If you like comedy and know little about the original ""Wild Wild West,"" you may find the comedy overwhelms the total destruction of history and scientific feasibility; or perhaps you like stories of alternate realities.  The special effects are wonderful.  I admit that when I could overcome my disappointment that there was no attempt to remain within the vision of the original show I was fascinated by the gadgets.  However, gadgetry alone does not overcome the unbelievable story.Oh, and as if all the other flaws in the movie were not enough to disappoint a viewer, the DVD includes Will Smith doing a hip-hop song.  Hip-hop in the west?  Perhaps I watched this movie from the wrong perspective.  Maybe if I had taken it for a farce, like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" I would have liked the movie better.

I was so excited to see it after hearing the theme song and knowing my boy Will Smith was going to be in it. I thought the moive was kind of stupid, but I really enjoy this moive.James West(Smith) is one of the top U.S. Secret Service Agents. President Grant is worried about a man Dr. Arliss Loveless(Branagh). He has been kidnapping different scientists who are the tops of their respective fields. West is teamed with one of the top U.S. marshalls Artemus Gordon(Kline). The two are hot on the trail and find a beautiful woman named Rita(Hayek) who is after Loveless as well because he kidnapped her father. Now are two agents must stop Loveless in time, before he can release his horrible creations upon the U.S.Will Smith wasn't really the right choice for James West. The complaint is legit that a black man shouldn't have been this big agent right after slaverly had just ended. It's ridiculous saying segregation took place up to the sixties. However, if you look past that flaw, then Smith really works. He is Will Smith and he has that Will Smith charm. He's a good action star and he excels in the action parts of the movie.Kevin Kline is also really good in the movie. I never watched the tv show, so I don't know how these two compare. Kline is good in the role and he runs with it. He's funny as the crafty inventor and he's just Kevin Kline.Salma Hayek is gorgeous in the moive. The was the first one I ever saw her in and she had me from the first time I saw her. Her acting isn't all that great in the movie, she's just there to simply look at for an hour and half, and it works.The special effects are really good in the film. Once again I wouldn't expect anything less from a moive with Will Smith in it. They aren't the best ones from his movies that he's been in, but they are good. The tarantula looked kind of cool and there is plenty of stuff blowing up in it.This was a summer blockbuser movie. The acting is terrible and so is the plot, but it's fun. The acting is fun, the special effects are great and it's a nice escape for two hours.

512565,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,B00001ZWTS,Priscilla Stafford,"[7, 10]","Once again I say, ""Wild Wild West"" has got to be on of the worst films I have ever seen. I myself have never seen the original TV series starring Robert Conrad but the movie ""Wild Wild West"" was pretty awful. And the thing which really gets me is, it could have been such a terrific movie!Two U.S. Marshals, Capt. James 'Jim' West (Will Smith) and Artemus 'Artie' Gordon (Kevin Kline) are assigned to discover why most of the country's leading scientists have been kidnapped. An old enemy of West's, General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine) lead them to the mastermind, a waist-high madman Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Dr. Loveless' plan? To take over the United States government!The plot is nothing new, a madman threatens to take over the government with the help of a super machine created by kidnapped scientists. The only people who can save everyone are the two main characters. You've heard it before, huh? ""Wild Wild West"" was extremely interesting in the way they thought up of a way to combine lots of cool inventions and gadgets into a story of the 'wild west'. But it has its many downfalls. One being that the story seemed to lull at some points, like it's just something to fill in the time. There should have been more twists and turns, captures and escapes, or something!The acting wasn't all that bad, though I must say I much more enjoy watching Will Smith in the ""Men in Black"" movies. He seems to have the exact same attitude, cockiness, and humor as he does in the movies I mentioned, except he lacks some smarts. He has a tendency to 'shoot first, shoot later, shoot some more and then when everybody's dead try to ask a question or two.' Unfortunately in this movie there really isn't given any chance for ANY of the characters to fully develop, let alone make you like and cheer for them. Kevin Kline for me was the best actor in the movie, him getting a chance to play two roles, one as Artemis Gordon and another as President Ulysses S. Grant. He was extremely charming and likable, a bit smarter and more sophisticated than his new partner. The bad guy played by Kenneth Branagh was nothing new, just your usual crazy madman. And though Salma Hayek is credited along with the main actors as Rita Escobar, you have no chance to see her much and for some reason was a very unlikable character. Though there was some attempt for Will Smith and Kevin Kline to vie for her affections, there is exactly 0% romance in this movie.And the reason for the 0% romance is because of blatant sexual jokes and innuendos put into ""Wild Wild West"". For a PG-13 movie, I found it a bit too much, even resulting for me to fast forward and skip some parts. And I believe this is one of the main reasons for the downfall of this movie. There were some moments where there was some good, clean, and fun humor, but the movie seems to mostly rely on innuendos and dirty jokes to make the audience laugh. And I assure you that I did not laugh much. ""Wild Wild West"" should have had some romance. Even most of the best action and adventure movies have romance, including such hits like ""Matrix"", ""Top Gun"", and much more.But I must give ""Wild Wild West"" the minimum of two stars for the action and special effects. Some of the action is pretty intense and exciting, especially the end. And the oh so super gadgets are VERY cool! I especially love the President's 'not-so-normal' train. Dr. Loveless's gigantic spider is dynamic, too. And Artie's numerous disguises are ingenious!To sum it up, ""Wild Wild West"" had some potential to become a fantastic movie. But because of the empty characterizations, somewhat empty plot, and terrible and sick jokes succeeds in making ""Wild Wild West"" a flop for me. If you're thinking about watching ""Wild Wild West"", rent it if you're really serious about seeing it. But here are two other recommendations, ""Men in Black"" stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones who fight extra-terrestrial and ""Silverado"" stars Kevin Kline as a gunfighter who saves the town of Silverado.Here an interesting bit of trivia for ""Wild Wild West"":The movie 'won' 5 statuettes at the 20th Annuel Razzie Awards, including Worst Picture.

512567,A16GM9G38VTJMV,B00001ZWTS,RedConOne,"[0, 1]","Wild Wild West i think was well before its time. Today a movie like this would be a flop with the critics and a score with younger generations who want to laugh at odd humor. The movie isn't bad depending on how you look at it. The story clearly wasn't supposed to be serious due to the equipment and obvious lack of seriousness in the movie. The problem lies in many viewers who watch it do so and compare it to other movies. With Wild WIld West you can't compare it because it stands alone in its own group.The movie is funny, there are parts where you'll bust up laughing. But be warned that if you buy the movie you must remember not to take the plot seriously and to take it the way it was intended as a comedy. If they wanted to make a serious film many things wouldn't have been in the movie such as: Loveless and his chair. The vast array of go go gadget type machines Loveless had. Plus back in the early years after the civil war women wouldn't be running around half nude in lingerie (im not sure lingerie was around back then anyway). This film sort of reminds me of a early hangover. Its plot is silly and stupid yet for some reason the movie is still funny.To watch this movie you have to keep in mind that its intent was to be a silly comedy. if you can remember that then you'll probably enjoy the laughs. Im not sure there is much replay value to this movie maybe once a year.Overall this film did make me laugh with its comedy and obvious bad acting (minus Smith's acting). However the same acting that made me laugh is also a reason i took a star away from the film. The plot is ridiculous and overall a B-list film from A list actors. Its not bad and for the current amazon price of $0.01 I'd say you don't have much to lose in checking it out and getting some laughs and giggles.In closing the flaws in the films acting and plot only earned it 3/5 stars or an ""It's OK"" rating.",3,Not bad maybe before its time though,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,1898,"['Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'i', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'time', 'Today', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'flop', 'critics', 'score', 'younger', 'generations', 'who', 'want', 'laugh', 'odd', 'humor', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'story', 'clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'serious', 'due', 'equipment', 'obvious', 'lack', 'seriousness', 'movie', 'problem', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'watch', 'do', 'so', 'compare', 'other', 'movies', 'Wild', 'WIld', 'West', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'alone', 'own', 'group.The', 'movie', 'funny', 'are', 'parts', 'where', ""'ll"", 'bust', 'up', 'laughing', 'be', 'warned', 'buy', 'movie', 'must', 'remember', 'not', 'take', 'plot', 'seriously', 'take', 'way', 'was', 'intended', 'comedy', 'wanted', 'make', 'serious', 'film', 'many', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'such', 'Loveless', 'chair', 'vast', 'array', 'go', 'go', 'gadget', 'type', 'machines', 'Loveless', 'had', 'back', 'early', 'years', 'civil', 'war', 'women', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'running', 'around', 'nude', 'lingerie', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'lingerie', 'was', 'around', 'back', 'then', 'anyway', 'film', 'sort', 'reminds', 'early', 'hangover', 'plot', 'silly', 'stupid', 'yet', 'reason', 'movie', 'still', 'funny.To', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'intent', 'was', 'be', 'silly', 'comedy', 'can', 'remember', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'laughs', 'Im', 'not', 'sure', 'much', 'replay', 'value', 'movie', 'maybe', 'once', 'year.Overall', 'film', 'did', 'make', 'comedy', 'obvious', 'bad', 'acting', 'Smith', 'acting', 'However', 'same', 'acting', 'made', 'laugh', 'also', 'reason', 'i', 'took', 'star', 'away', 'film', 'plot', 'ridiculous', 'overall', 'B-list', 'film', 'A', 'list', 'actors', 'not', 'bad', 'current', 'amazon', 'price', '0.01', ""'d"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'lose', 'checking', 'getting', 'laughs', 'giggles.In', 'closing', 'flaws', 'films', 'acting', 'plot', 'only', 'earned', '3/5', 'stars', 'OK', 'rating']",Wild Wild West VHS

512569,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00001ZWTS,Reviewer,"[9, 13]","This is a project that had everything going for it:  A terrific cast, a director with a proven track record, great special effects, a huge budget  and the promise of being the heir apparent of a successful television  series.  So what went wrong?  Because ""Wild Wild West,"" directed by Barry  Sonnenfeld, is...well, just not very good.  It's a case, apparently, of  everything being poised for greatness until it all went south.  And that's  pretty much the bottom line here; nothing about this film works.  Nothing.  Not that everyone didn't try hard, because it's obvious that they did,  right down to the last man and the last lame joke.  It reminds me of a line  from ""Mystery Men"":  Someone refers to another as being ""mysterious;""  someone else says, ""That's it?  He's mysterious?""  ""Well,"" is the reply,  ""He's VERY mysterious.""  Did they try hard in this one?  They tried VERY  hard.  But, very simply, nothing worked.  The usually charismatic Will  Smith (James West) didn't even have that working for him here; Kevin Kline  (Artemus) didn't fare any better, and Kenneth Branagh (Dr. Loveless) proved  to be one of the most forgettable villains in the history of the cinema.  His over-the-top performance could do nothing to salvage a character that  was anemic and uninteresting to begin with.  As for Salma Hayek, it's  nothing more than a case of a beautiful, talented actress being used as  window dressing; and here it's like putting curtains on the windows of the  Titanic even as it's sinking.  Sonnenfeld will have to accept his  share of the blame, since the director, above and beyond everyone else,  should have seen what was happening as filming progressed (or in this case,  regressed).  It's hard to figure how the man who gave us ""Men In Black"" and  ""Get Shorty"" (among others) could have let this one slip so badly.  It's  downright confusing as to how such enormously talented people could come  together and go so awry in their endeavors.  The principles here all have  proven themselves elsewhere as masters of impeccable timing, whether it be  in comedy, drama or action features, yet even that falls flat here.  It's  as if this project had a ""Jonah"" on it from the beginning.  As far as the  plot is concerned, I will not divulge any salient points; unfortunately,  there is nothing significant enough to divulge.  There are a number of  jokes scattered throughout the movie that are not only bad, but seem as if  they were an afterthought, possibly added to a scene only when repairs  could not be effected in the editing room.  If you have not yet seen  this movie, and if you are a fan of Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth  Branagh or Salma Hayek, or if you have fond memories of the T.V. series  that spawned this film, do yourself a favor:  Rent or buy ""Enemy of the  State,"" ""A Fish Called Wanda,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" or ""Fools Rush  In,"" and let this one go.  Protect those fond memories.  If you absolutely  must have a taste of this, try to catch the music video with Smith doing  the title song.  That video is the best thing about this whole project, and  Hayek has a much more significant part in it than she does in the movie.  Twenty years or so from now, someone will ask Smith what went wrong with  ""Wild Wild West;"" and he'll probably reply, ""Who knows?  It just didn't  work.""  As for now, all anyone can say is, ""Who Knows?  It just didn't  work.""

512571,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00001ZWTS,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 9]","`Wild Wild West' joins an increasingly long list of big bloated blockbusters, movies made for no possible reason beyond grabbing a quick  summer buck yet which, ironically, by their very cynical and slapdash  nature, utterly fail to connect with even the least demanding of audiences.  The result is a multi-multi-million dollar debacle that leaves studios  searching for answers and audiences shell-shocked into seeking out their  entertainment along the more audacious pathway of off-Hollywood,  independent filmmaking - the single positive outcome of these dull, empty  enterprises.`Wild Wild West,' like so many films before it, looks to the  relics of television's bygone era for inspiration - as sad a comment as any  on the dismal state of current movie creativity. As one not familiar with  the original series, I cannot say what justice, or lack of justice, this  homage does to its source. What is evident, judging from the results on  screen, is that `Wild Wild West' is, as with most current blockbusters,  top-heavy with special effects and as weak in the nether limbs as its  legless villain. Straight Westerns being hopelessly out of fashion,  especially for a special effects-driven summertime extravaganza, the  filmmakers obviously felt that what was needed was a tongue-in-cheek  approach to the material, resulting in a bizarre, but completely unfunny  amalgam of fantasy and science-fiction gilded onto a Western format. The  disparate styles simply fight against each other, leaving no one in the  audience - neither Western nor science-fiction fans - satisfied.The  alleged plot involves the attempts by James West (Will Smith) and Artemis  Gordon (Kevin Kline) to foil an evil Confederate inventor's plan to kidnap  all the world's most brilliant scientists and, ultimately, terrorize the  Union and President Grant into submission. This he attempts to do by  creating a giant mechanized spider which is, obviously, a last ditch,  desperate attempt on the part of the filmmakers to fulfill the seemingly  insatiable demands of the modern audience to be dazzled by impressive  special effects, no matter how inappropriate they appear in context. Here,  though, the miscalculation is fatal because even the audience is wise  enough to know when it is being had. Kline and Smith never achieve a  palpable rapport despite the usual abundance of lame wise cracks and  sarcastic asides designed to make them `hip' and `trendy' - two qualities  incongruous to the setting, which again shows the lack of real commitment  to the spirit of the project. There is exactly one clever moment in the  film - an astonishingly creative homage to the old RCA logo - that hints at  what might have been had the moviemakers been willing to really let loose  their anarchic imaginations and aimed for something truly sophisticated  rather than simply pasting together a series of confused, poorly written  blackout sketches.Incidentally, even some of the expensive special  effects come across as surprisingly crude, especially many of the shots  utilizing rear-screen projection.

Like most movies based on TV shows the producers violate the rule of TV in making the film: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Every Alteration here only makes this big budget film all the disaster you've heard about.I didn't believe Will Smith as Jim West. He plays this 1800's Marshall like all of the other roles in his film career. Smith isn't playing Jim West, he's ""The Fresh Prince of the old west."" If you've watched that sitcom you'll notice Smith acting goofy and making dumb jokes while the rest of the cast acts around him. The same thing applies here. Smith doesn't become a character in WWW. It is essentially Will smith being Will Smith in a cowboy costume while actors desperately try to act around him and the horrible script. Kevin Kline struggles with the role of Artemis Gordon because they don't give him any material to work with or a better actor to play off of. He and Smith have no chemistry. Salma Hayek was only hired to look pretty and act sweet here. To watch her really act, buy ""Frieda."" And the villain was just too over the top. After watching this film and ""Independence Day"" I realize that Will Smith is the luckiest man in Hollywood. He has no acting skills at all. However they pay him $20 million a film for just being himself. I can only shake my head and wonder why the Academy nominated him for an Oscar in ""Ali."" SOMEONE NEEDS TO TELL THE ACADEMY THAT YOU HAVE TO ACT IN ORDER TO BE NOMINATED FOR BEST ACTOR!This film was not only done in by the casting, but the script as well. The story about ex confederates trying to turn the U.S. back the way it was in the pre-colonial period was puerile. The more the story progressed, the stupider it got. After watching this movie I seriously believe that somewhere in Hollywood there are Chimpanzees running the movie studios approving and writing these scripts. Bonzo cannot just be a movie character; he has to be a reality with dreck like this being made by the studios.But the producers probably knowing that in between the wretched casting and the horrible script that this film was a disaster pulled out the post 1995 bad film repair kit known as special effects and CGI. They figured slap in a few stunts and a few special effects and they could pass this film off by telling the audience Will Smith was in it. The tongue-in-cheek inventions were so over the top they were boring, and the giant mechanical spider was a gimmick to get people's butts into seats. Thankfully, People saw through the CGI ruse and stayed away from this attempt to create a Will Smith franchise.",1,Awful. Simply Awful.

The television series that serves--barely--as the model for this overbudgeted, underdeveloped redux was one of the best fantasy concepts ever (007 meets ""Bonanza""), a showcase for the dynamite team of supercool Robert Conrad and charming Ross Martin.  Director Barry Sonnenfeld just doesn't seem to get it.  His first mistake was casting one-trick-pony Will Smith in the Conrad role; reimagining James West as a ""person of color"" was a great idea (Conrad himself had suggested Jackie Chan), but Smith's lackluster presence and incessant mugging for the camera grow tiresome, as usual, after five minutes.  Kevin Kline as master-of-disguise Artemus Gordon is more inspired but instead of letting him be a member of an elite team, the script makes him West's cranky rival for too long in the film.  It's like watching Archie and Reggie in cowboy hats but without the action and suspense.  While his Dr. Loveless lacks the winning combination of pathos and villainy that Michael Dunn brought to the TV role, Kenneth Brannagh, at least, seems to be having fun as the requisite egomaniacal genius.  The plot is, by and large, a mess--something about gunrunning, Ulysses S. Grant, and giant, steam-powered spiders; somehow, in two hours, Sonnenfeld manages to convey a story with less flair, delight, and imagination than a single hour of the TV series.  Cold and flat computer-generated effects are no match for the simpler but more atmospheric production values of the series and like most recent remakes, the production crew seems to have a shallow understanding of the source material.

Will Smith might have made a good Jim West, but we'll never know, because he was apparently playing a trigger happy version of the great, great, Grandfather of ""J"" from Men in Black instead.  Kevin Kline doesn't fare any better, playing Master of Disguise Artemus Gordon like a fussy Felix Unger of the West, who's favorite disguises always seem to involve him dressing in drag. And kenneth branagh as Dr(""Arliss"" - they couldn't even get his name right!)Loveless is just annoying, Michael Dunn's original Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless would have fed this idiotic impostor to his flesh eating house plants, bit by bit, while he was still screaming. Oh, and Selma Hayek is in it too - just more window dressing, she had NOTHING interesting to do in this film!One of the greatest assets of the Original, was the chemistry between West and Gordon, you really felt like they were Brothers in arms, either of whom would gladly lay down his Life to help the other.

512598,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00001ZWTS,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""Wild Wild West"" has to be one of the most notorious films ever made. Released in 1999, it's a blockbuster parody of the late-60's TV series with Will Smith in the starring role, which should tip everyone off that the film's not meant to be taken seriously (not that the TV series could be taken all that seriously either, just more serious than this movie).Kevin Kline plays James West's reluctant partner and he's a wiz with gizmos. Many complain about the ""lack of chemistry"" of the two stars, but I think it's a bunch of Barbra Streisand (BS). What these people don't get is that these characters are NOT SUPPOSED to like each other. As far as I'm concerned, Smith & Kline make an entertaining team and are perfectly suitable for this movie.Kenneth Branagh and Ted Levine are also on hand as villains, but it's sassy, petite Salma Hayek who wins the prize for best supporting actor. This is only the second film I've seen here in and she just shines. Salma appears in some attractive outfits, including one with white fishnet stockings, and she's just a beauty to behold.BOTTOM LINE: I don't get what the whiners are complaining about with this movie, unless they were uber-fans of the TV series and were expecting a serious film adaption. ""Wild Wild West"" is an energetic goofy blockbuster spoof with all the requisite trappings, like 1999's ""The Mummy"" and 2004's ""Van Helsing."" I call these types of films ""big dumb fun"" movies because they're not meant to be taken too seriously; they're ""Summer blockbusters"" and solely exist to entertain & amuse the viewer. Knowing this will help you appreciate ""Wild Wild West."" So turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in California, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Idaho.GRADE: B",4,"It's a blockbuster parody, what do ya expect?",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,1764,"['Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'notorious', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Released', '1999', 'blockbuster', 'parody', 'late-60', 'TV', 'series', 'Will', 'Smith', 'starring', 'role', 'should', 'tip', 'everyone', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'not', 'TV', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'just', 'more', 'serious', 'movie', '.Kevin', 'Kline', 'James', 'West', 'reluctant', 'partner', 'wiz', 'gizmos', 'Many', 'complain', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'two', 'stars', 'think', 'bunch', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'BS', 'What', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'characters', 'are', 'NOT', 'SUPPOSED', 'like', 'other', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Smith', 'Kline', 'make', 'entertaining', 'team', 'are', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'movie.Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'are', 'also', 'hand', 'villains', 'sassy', 'petite', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'who', 'prize', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'only', 'second', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'here', 'just', 'shines', 'Salma', 'attractive', 'outfits', 'including', 'one', 'white', 'fishnet', 'stockings', 'just', 'beauty', 'behold.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'whiners', 'are', 'complaining', 'movie', 'were', 'uber-fans', 'TV', 'series', 'were', 'expecting', 'serious', 'film', 'adaption', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'energetic', 'goofy', 'blockbuster', 'spoof', 'requisite', 'trappings', '1999', 'Mummy', '2004', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'call', 'types', 'films', 'big', 'dumb', 'fun', 'movies', ""'re"", 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', ""'re"", 'Summer', 'blockbusters', 'solely', 'exist', 'entertain', 'amuse', 'viewer', 'Knowing', 'will', 'help', 'appreciate', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'So', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'enjoy', 'ride.The', 'film', '106', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'California', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Utah', 'Arizona', 'Idaho.GRADE', 'B']",Wild Wild West VHS
