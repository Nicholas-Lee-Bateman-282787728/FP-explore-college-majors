Matthew is a boxing fan with heavy knowledge of the sport as well as his grandfather was once a boxer & referee.  Coming to a new town also means being the new kid at school & as he made friends with Ruby (Emma Grabinsky) & Nick (Samuel Chu), he also made an enemy after asking out Teresa (Tess Atkins) in her boyfriend Hector (Jaren Bartlett) leading to constant bullying from him & his crew.  Once incident caused the school janitor Dan Barnes (Steve Austin) to step in & encourage Matthew to join the boxing club which he does behind his mother's back who didn't approve of it.  After Hector destroyed him in the first sparring match & Coach Harward (Roman Podhora) kicking Matthew out of the gym for what he did after the match, Dan agreed to train him which gave Matthew new confidence but after another incident with Hector, Dan arranged a boxing match between the two to settle the issue.  So while preparing for the fight, Matthew has to deal with relationships around him with other people such as Ruby, his parents, and Dan.Other reviewers have compared this to ""The Karate Kid"" which it is in many ways as far as the story of a kid being bullied & someone stepping up to help him overcome it.  This was an enjoyable family movie & I have to admit that I liked the influence of boxing in this movie while the acting & script wasn't bad at all for this being straight to home video.

Instead, as other reviewers have pointed out, this film is a boxing take on the Karate Kid.Knockout is decent family fare, I guess. But I can't watch this film and not see a missed opportunity.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but clearly this is a family film intended for a much younger and broader audience. I won't be surprised if this finds its way to the ABC Family channel.Interesting career choice on the part of Austin, and in comparison to a similar move, a quantum leap improvement on Vin Diesel's detestable movie 'The Pacifier'.All things being equal - I hope producers will hook Steve into the 'Undisputed' franchise.

Going into this movie, my expectations were low thinking I might be mildly amused by it. It was actually a little better than I thought. I think even Steve Austin would admit he's not exactly in the same acting class as say a Robert De Niro or an Al Pacino, but his performance here was actually not bad. If I had to choose, I would say he was probably the best actor in the film. He played his role well. He was believable. Unfortunately, his co-star wasn't. While Austin held his own, Daniel Magder was wooden and awkward and not in that awkward teenager, almost adorable kind of way. He didn't look comfortable in front of the camera and in a couple of scenes I could almost see Austin looking at this kid like ""Come on, give me something to work with.""There were a few times where it felt like the movie was gonna fall apart, but somehow Austin held it together.
