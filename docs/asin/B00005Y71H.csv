689358,A2YC5Y2ABK0MJZ,B00005Y71H,"Allen W. Wright ""Webmaster, 'rogue scholar""","[27, 28]","As the ads for the original comic book said, Just Imagine! Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and more on one team. Well, actually as a child of 1970s, I can imagine it quite easily. On TV, it was called The Superfriends. But in the comics, these heroes were The Justice League. Now, they are back!This DVD is the first three episodes of a new cartoon series which at the moment isn't being shown in my country of Canada.First the good, the cartoon is exciting. It's a fast-moving plot -- which as others have stated owes a debt to Wells's War of the Worlds (as well as some Justice League comic books, where the invaders were White Martians and Apellaxians.)For an action-driven movie, the character interplay is very good. Flash is an impulsive joker, Green Lantern a military type, Hawkgirl a fierce warrior. Relatively simple characterization but they blend fairly well.And I like the composition of the team. With several Green Lanterns to choose from, they picked John Stewart. I see that a former reviewer complained about this. Well, essentially, GL is just a name and a power. So, why not pick the black (or African American, as Americans say) one? The same with Hawkgirl? I really don't see the big deal here. It makes sense. After all, Kryptonians and Thanagarians and Martians --- well, that really isn't diversity.My problems? Well, the plot is a bit thin. I think this comes from being a ""widescreen"" (well, full frame in this case) epic battle. But the bigger problem? I know who John Stewart is (originally a social activist with a chip on his shoulder, and an architect). I know who the Wally West Flash is. But I doubt the non-comics reader does. Sure, the DVD has a character bio section. But I think with newcomer Wonder Woman, someone could have given her a brief description of the heroes. It's called Secret Origins, but really, the only origin we get is J'Onn J'Onnz's origin. I'm not even sure anyone ever calls Green Lantern by his superhero name once.But if their names don't come through, their characters do. Much more sharply than they did on the old Superfriends.Still... my biggest problem? That it doesn't contain all those cool adventures I've been hearing about? Manhunters? The Injustice Gang? A Pseudo-Earth 2? Metamorpho? Bring them on!Oh, and as for the person who said this was DC's answer to the X-Men?

I have been a great fan of the Justice League of America comics for over two decades and news of a new Cartoon Network series based on the Justice League certainly had me salivating.The pilot more than lived up to my expectations. The plot was not entirely original (invading tripods from Mars, anyone?) but it was riveting nevertheless. In 60 minutes, you get a pretty clear idea of the characterisation of each of the seven superheroes making up this version of the Justice League. Having always been a great Wonder Woman fan, I was surprised to discover the my favorite character in the pilot was not her, but Hawkgirl. She certainly wields that mace to great effect! She reminds me of Big Barda with a mace instead of Barda's power rod.I would have liked the series to use the REAL big seven - Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), Flash, Aquaman and Martian Manhunter - but I can understand the need for diversity by putting in one other female character and an African American one as well.

Basically, they have NO LIVES and appear to live in spandex 24 hours a day!  Heck, Batman was written better on a recent episode of Static Shock than he's been portrayed in Justice League thus far.The voice acting is VERY wooden on the show.  As well cast as the earlier shows were, it appears the casting directors were or other authorities ultimately in charge of casting the character voices were asleep at the wheel!  Especially bad are the voices of Superman (who is sadly no longer voiced by Tim Daly who was excellent in the previous Superman animated series) and The Flash who consistently manages to be the dullest voice each episode.  The animation is equally as wooden.

689369,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B00005Y71H,Hazen B Markoe,"[13, 16]","After the success of its Batman, Superman, and Batman Beyond cartoons, it was only a matter of time before Bruce Timm and the rest of the Warner Brothers animated unit tackled the DC superhero team known as the Justice League.  Created for the Cartoon Network, this DVD covers the hour-long premiere episode which introduces the superteam.  In order to protect Earth from an alien invasion, Batman, Superman and new ally Martian Manhunter must enlist the help of some of their fellow crimefighters to stave off the threat. But can the heroes mesh their rather different personalities in time to work as a team before it's too late?  Despite having to juggle 7 main characters, JUSTICE LEAGUE proves to be another feather in Warner Brothers' cap. As always, the animation is especially vivid and the voice acting is solid. By now, Kevin Conroy can voice Batman in his sleep, but he still turns in a definitive turn in the role.  Michael Rosenbaum (aka Lex Luthor in TV's SMALLVILLE) is fun as the smart-alecky Flash.  Carl Lumbley (Jennifer Garner's agent partner on TV's ALIAS) is appropriately enigmatic as the Martian Manhunter. Obviously, because of the more globe-trotting/space-hopping nature of the series, this series is a tad brighter in tone from BATMAN:THE ANIMATED SERIES.

Very different from the awesome Batman and Batman Beyond works, but solid in its own right.  I think the Justice League is more appropriate for youngsters than Batman Beyond:  The Return of the Joker.One thing that makes team-based superhero movies (Justice League, X-Men) not quite as good as single or dual superhero movies (Superman, Batman, Batman and Robin) is that there just isn't time to develop the relationships between the characters and the characters' own personalities.  Because there are so many characters competing for ""scenes and dialog,"" there isn't enough time to do all the characters justice (no pun intended).This movie was fine, but true enjoyment of this well done adaptation of DC Comics' counterpart to Marvel's ""Avengers"" will come from regularly tuning in to the series on TV.  If the writers do their jobs, they will make Justice League appealing to both youngsters and older geeks, and tolerable for the youngsters' frazzled parents.  The TV series should give the creators and writers enough time to do a good job blending lots of action and good animation with character development and interaction.Think of other ""team-based"" series that have hit it big.  From the original Star Trek and its newer offspring, to Friends, part of the enjoyment derived is watching relationships develop over time.

I was familiar with ""Superfriends"" which I use to watch as a kid, but that was very much just a kids show. But knowing that ""Justice League"" was a spin-off of the ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" shows, I knew that it would be a little more adult in its plot and characterization of the characters, but when I was watching this I thought they had turned a serious science-fiction movie into a series science-fiction cartoon drama. It was very dramatic. Not a thing usually seen in a cartoon series. This was more serious and dramatic than the ""Batman"" and Superman"" shows that came before it. I loved every moment of it. It's very action-packed, it's got a good plot, and some scenes really got to me even as an adult. ""Justice League"" is great for both kids and adults. My 60-year-old dad even liked it.The Plot:Astronauts awaken an ancient evil on Mars that puts the entire Earth in jeopardy. Batman is investigating strange activities at Wayne Tech in Metropolis, and with Superman's help, they uncover a sinister alien plot to invade the Earth. A friendly alien, Martian Manhunter, helps Batman and Superman battle the alien invaders, but even that isn't enough to stop them. Eventually Wonder Woman, the Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and the Flash join in on the battle. But even with the world's greatest Superheroes, can the invaders be stopped?

As the decades went by, DC Comics added to their roster of popular superheroes; Wonder Woman, Flash, and many others. Now for the first time, they've all come together under one name, one show: Justice League.Okay, this isn't the *first* time. Originally Hanna-Barbara came out with a Justice-League show called 'Superfriends', but that was more of a fanboy's worst nightmare. Justice League (JL) is the latest creation of Bruce Timm, who was one of the major talents behind the award-winning Batman: The Animated Series, Superman, and Batman Beyond. Using the same stylized animation and feel of their past shows, JL is actually the first story arc of the new series. Here, Jonn Jon'z (Martian Manhunter) is introduced, and leads Earth's heroes on a quest to prevent an alien invasion.In all fairness, JL isn't as good as Timm's previous shows, but thats because it has to balance seven main characters, each with their own unique powers and personalities. We know a good deal about Batman and Superman, but that's only because they've had entire shows for character development. The episode is basically about Jonn Jon'z, so we learn a lot about him.

The backstories of Diana [a.k.a] Wonder Woman and J'onn Jonzz [a.k.a] Martian Manhunter are revealed throughout the course of the story.  Intriguing character relationships are introduced (i.e. the Flash and Green Lantern) and the series' intergalactic setting is introduced.It is unfortunate, however, that more special features were not included on this disc (beyond the standard trailers and character profiles).  Especially missed was commentary featuring series creator Bruce Timm included on previous Batman and Superman DVD discs.Overall, ""Secret Origins"" is a welcome addition to the WB version of the DC universe and serves as springboard to the future stories of the Justice League which carry the heroes from the boundaries of Earth to the far reaches of the universe.",4,A natural extension of the WB version of the DC universe,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,1226,"['Perhaps', 'best', 'aspect', 'movie', 'be', 'introduction', 'major', 'players', 'DC', 'universe', 'notably', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Martian', 'Manhunter', 'who', 'had', 'hitherto', 'been', 'absent', '1990', 'WB', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'series.Backed', 'strong', 'plot', 'movie', 'titled', 'Secret', 'Orgins', 'originally', 'three', 'part', 'story', 'manner', 'Superman', 'fellow', 'superheroes', 'unified', 'team', 'purpose', 'protect', 'planet', 'backstories', 'Diana', '[', 'a.k.a', ']', 'Wonder', 'Woman', ""J'onn"", 'Jonzz', '[', ']', 'Martian', 'Manhunter', 'are', 'revealed', 'course', 'story', 'Intriguing', 'character', 'relationships', 'are', 'introduced', 'i.e', 'Flash', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'series', 'intergalactic', 'setting', 'introduced.It', 'unfortunate', 'however', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'disc', 'standard', 'trailers', 'character', 'profiles', 'Especially', 'missed', 'was', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'series', 'creator', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'included', 'previous', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'DVD', 'discs.Overall', 'Secret', 'Origins', 'welcome', 'addition', 'WB', 'version', 'DC', 'universe', 'serves', 'springboard', 'future', 'stories', 'Justice', 'League', 'carry', 'heroes', 'boundaries', 'Earth', 'far', 'universe']",Justice League - Secret Origins

I have fond memories of most DC comic heroes and was curious to see how they've evolved in one-plus generations.My first impression was that the acceptable, if unspectacular, animation is much better than it was in the earlier incarnation, especially the backgrounds.  Took me a while to get used to the exaggerated physiques and lunch-bucket jaws on the super heroes, especially Superman and Batman.The story in JUSTICE LEAGUE is interesting and involving.  Earth is invaded by an army from Mars who plan to block out the sun, subjugate the human race and take over the Earth for some nefarious reason or other.  The writers cribbed a lot from H.G. Wells and a bit from latter-day science fiction to cobble this one together.  The invaders speak tinny squeak talk and look like marshmallow blobs studded with nougats.

The world has turned over its protection to Superman and disarmed.  Now an alien race called the Imperium has decided that Earth would make a good colony for them and begin converting our atmosphere for their arrival.  Superman and Batman rescue a Martian who has come to earth to warn the world about the invading aliens.  This of course would be the powerful, shape-changing Martian Manhunter.Soon the trio would be joined by several other of earths heroes including the Flash, Green lantern, Wonder Woman, and Hawk Girl as they eventually defeat the alien threat and the Justice League of America is born.  Very enjoyable storyline with the animation quality we've come to expect from Warners.  The voice talents are outstanding as usual and include Mark Hamill, Phil La Marr, Michael Rosenbaum, Gary Cole, Clancy Brown, and James Remarr.The problem is why isn't Warners giving us the season one on DVD?  I mean $12 or so for 3 episodes and just 60 minues is really weak.  Add to that there's basically no extras you get a set that has very little value for the money.
