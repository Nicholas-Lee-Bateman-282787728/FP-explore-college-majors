254425,ALR1CN6DL50DA,6301505638,Felixpath,"[2, 2]","I was only six when I first saw ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" on video. That was in 1994. Our friends taped it for us, and good thing, because the movie dropped off the face of the earth until recently. I'm thrilled to find it on DVD, because it's remained one of my family's most beloved (and weird) films. It's not a really a kid's film, unless your kids are brainy and literate. What it is is a strange, beautiful, unsettling, funny, and unforgettable work of animation and storytelling that blends fact, fiction and fantasy.Mark Twain is indeed the central figure, though we see him through the eyes of his three famous child characters: Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, and Becky Thatcher. In the strange metaworld of the movie, the aging Mr. Twain is taking off in a fantastical airship to meet Halley's Comet, which lit up the skies during his birth and is now returning to see him to his grave (true fact). His ship is right up there with Howl's Moving Castle in terms of whimsy and inventiveness; it is part dirigible and part steamboat, with a multitude of strange features and gadgets and functions that do not abide by the rules of physics. Tom, Huck, and Becky stow away on the ship by accident, and as the foursome chug through the sky toward their fateful meeting with the comet, the movie leaves all boundaries behind.The main plot is engaging, as the three children attempt to understand this strange old author and his fancies. Tom wants to hijack the ship and make a new story with himself as the hero. And there is a mysterious fifth passenger lurking about -- who could it be? Ah, but in the meantime, the film breaks from the plot to dive (literally) into some of Twain's literary works. We see a clever retelling of the Celebrated Jumping Frog, a disturbing visit with the Mysterious Stranger (concerned parents may want to fast-forward through this bit), and a bizarre and comical interlude with Captain Stormfield and some pushy aliens. The standouts, though, are two extended sequences focusing on Twain's Diary of Adam and Eve. We see the first couple during their time in the garden of Eden and their banishment, surrounded first by wonders and then by the hardships of real life and family. Adam and Eve turn out to be incredibly dysfunctional (he's lazy and stubborn, she's controlling and anal-retentive), but their exploits, while comedic, are ultimately touching and somehow perfectly appropriate. Meanwhile, in the real(?) world, Twain and the children must cope with such threats as a vicious storm, Tom's reckless hijacking scheme, and what happens when they actually reach the comet....Creator and animator Will Vinton has an amazing and unique style. His clay figures are distinct and expressive and his fantastical visions are delightful. He uses clay as paint, blending color and form to create amazing sights. Bodies and vehicles morph and shapeshift with cheerful abandon, creating an elastic reality that never grows boring. Such thrilling scenes as the lightning storm and the final ""showdown"" with Halley's Comet suck you in, and when you remember how much time and effort goes into claymation, it becomes all the more impressive. Artists as dedicated to their craft as Vinton are rare, and their work should certainly be elevated. He has made a great tribute to Mark Twain and his works, and I really hope that ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" is destined for a long and successful run on DVD. I plan to tell as many people as possible about it.",5,Visionary!,1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,3487,"['was', 'only', 'six', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Adventures', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'video', 'was', '1994', 'friends', 'taped', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'dropped', 'face', 'earth', 'recently', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'find', 'DVD', 'remained', 'one', 'family', 'most', 'beloved', 'weird', 'films', 'not', 'really', 'kid', 'film', 'kids', 'are', 'brainy', 'literate', 'What', 'strange', 'beautiful', 'unsettling', 'funny', 'unforgettable', 'work', 'animation', 'storytelling', 'fact', 'fiction', 'fantasy.Mark', 'Twain', 'indeed', 'central', 'figure', 'see', 'eyes', 'three', 'famous', 'child', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'Becky', 'Thatcher', 'strange', 'metaworld', 'movie', 'aging', 'Mr', 'Twain', 'taking', 'off', 'fantastical', 'airship', 'meet', 'Halley', 'Comet', 'lit', 'up', 'skies', 'birth', 'now', 'returning', 'see', 'grave', 'true', 'fact', 'ship', 'right', 'there', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'terms', 'whimsy', 'inventiveness', 'part', 'dirigible', 'part', 'steamboat', 'multitude', 'strange', 'features', 'gadgets', 'functions', 'do', 'not', 'abide', 'rules', 'physics', 'Tom', 'Huck', 'Becky', 'stow', 'away', 'ship', 'accident', 'foursome', 'chug', 'sky', 'fateful', 'meeting', 'comet', 'movie', 'boundaries', 'behind.The', 'main', 'plot', 'engaging', 'three', 'children', 'attempt', 'understand', 'strange', 'old', 'author', 'fancies', 'Tom', 'hijack', 'ship', 'make', 'new', 'story', 'hero', 'mysterious', 'fifth', 'passenger', 'lurking', 'about', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'Ah', 'meantime', 'film', 'breaks', 'plot', 'dive', 'literally', 'Twain', 'literary', 'works', 'see', 'clever', 'retelling', 'Celebrated', 'Jumping', 'Frog', 'disturbing', 'visit', 'Mysterious', 'Stranger', 'concerned', 'parents', 'may', 'want', 'fast-forward', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'comical', 'interlude', 'Captain', 'Stormfield', 'pushy', 'aliens', 'standouts', 'are', 'two', 'extended', 'sequences', 'focusing', 'Twain', 'Diary', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'see', 'first', 'couple', 'time', 'garden', 'Eden', 'banishment', 'surrounded', 'first', 'wonders', 'then', 'hardships', 'real', 'life', 'family', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'incredibly', 'dysfunctional', 'lazy', 'stubborn', 'controlling', 'anal-retentive', 'exploits', 'comedic', 'are', 'ultimately', 'touching', 'somehow', 'perfectly', 'appropriate', 'Meanwhile', 'real', 'world', 'Twain', 'children', 'must', 'cope', 'such', 'threats', 'vicious', 'storm', 'Tom', 'reckless', 'hijacking', 'scheme', 'what', 'when', 'actually', 'reach', 'comet', '.Creator', 'animator', 'Will', 'Vinton', 'amazing', 'unique', 'style', 'clay', 'figures', 'are', 'distinct', 'expressive', 'fantastical', 'visions', 'are', 'delightful', 'clay', 'paint', 'blending', 'color', 'form', 'create', 'amazing', 'sights', 'Bodies', 'vehicles', 'morph', 'shapeshift', 'cheerful', 'abandon', 'creating', 'elastic', 'reality', 'never', 'boring', 'Such', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'lightning', 'storm', 'final', 'showdown', 'Halley', 'Comet', 'suck', 'when', 'remember', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'claymation', 'more', 'impressive', 'Artists', 'dedicated', 'craft', 'Vinton', 'are', 'rare', 'work', 'should', 'certainly', 'be', 'elevated', 'made', 'great', 'tribute', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'works', 'really', 'hope', 'Adventures', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'destined', 'long', 'successful', 'run', 'DVD', 'plan', 'tell', 'many', 'people', 'possible']",Adventures of Mark Twain VHS

254427,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,6301505638,H. Snyder,"[0, 0]","This film is a colorful introduction to the works and philosophy of Mark Twain, woven into an artistic tapestry made of clay. Old films with lush color and intricate detail benefit enormously from a high definition transcription, and The Adventures of Mark Twain comes roaring to life in this Blu-ray restoration. It certainly has not been seen in its full glory since its release in 1984, and this lovely edition might even exceed the experience of the original screening.Although the term ""Claymation"" is now in general usage meaning animation created through the manipulation of clay figures, it is actually a copyrighted word coined by Will Vinton. His Academy Award and Emmy Award winning films showcased the pinnacle of artistic development in the technique, and none more so than The Adventures of Mark Twain. Wonderfully detailed character faces are complemented by lavishly decorated sets and swirling backgrounds, each minute on the screen having required many hours to create. Recent practitioners like Aardman studios in Britain have advanced the art of creating an engaging story with clay figures, but none have surpassed the realism achieved by Vinton.The Adventures of Mark Twain follows the career of America's premier author of the nineteenth century, as he tells some of his stories to his best-known characters: Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn and Becky Thatcher. The children have stowed away on Twain's airship, which he is piloting toward a rendezvous with Halley's Comet. The stories are connected by a background narrative consisting largely of direct quotes from Mark Twain, who is perhaps now better known for his pithy and cynical comments than for his books. As one of those quotes states, ""Classic books are those people want to have read, but don't want to read.""Mark Twain's first published story was the Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and it is presented first in the film. The great majority of Twain's writing had nothing to do with religion, but of the four stories highlighted in this film, three are inspired by the Bible, or touch obliquely on religious themes. We are shown the good humored Diaries of Adam and Eve, then we encounter the dark Mysterious Stranger. The ""stranger"" identifies himself as Satan. Lastly, we accompany Captain Stormfield on his visit to heaven. A few viewers, unaware of Twain's religious skepticism, are surprised and uneasy when they find that he wasn't all about jumping frog contests and whitewashing fences.I was particularly moved by viewing The Adventures of Mark Twain because I had read while in Jr. High School everything Twain had written, with the exception of the suppressed works such as Letters from the Earth, which was not published until many years after his death. Like a visit with an old, old friend, the film was a bittersweet experience. Twain's works were a reflection of the reality of life, mixing the humor and the sorrow. A perfect example of this duality is taken from the Diaries of Adam and Eve, where after a lifetime of comical adventures, Adam writes the last words in his diary following the death of Eve: ""Wheresoever she was, there was Eden.""",5,Blu-ray Reveals the Art of Claymation,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,3157,"['film', 'colorful', 'introduction', 'works', 'philosophy', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'woven', 'artistic', 'tapestry', 'made', 'clay', 'Old', 'films', 'lush', 'color', 'intricate', 'detail', 'benefit', 'enormously', 'high', 'definition', 'transcription', 'Adventures', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'roaring', 'life', 'Blu-ray', 'restoration', 'certainly', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'full', 'glory', 'release', '1984', 'lovely', 'edition', 'might', 'even', 'exceed', 'experience', 'original', 'term', 'Claymation', 'now', 'general', 'usage', 'meaning', 'animation', 'created', 'manipulation', 'clay', 'figures', 'actually', 'copyrighted', 'word', 'coined', 'Will', 'Vinton', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'winning', 'films', 'showcased', 'pinnacle', 'artistic', 'development', 'technique', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'Adventures', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Wonderfully', 'detailed', 'character', 'are', 'complemented', 'lavishly', 'decorated', 'sets', 'swirling', 'backgrounds', 'minute', 'screen', 'having', 'required', 'many', 'hours', 'create', 'Recent', 'practitioners', 'Aardman', 'studios', 'Britain', 'have', 'advanced', 'art', 'creating', 'engaging', 'story', 'clay', 'figures', 'none', 'have', 'surpassed', 'realism', 'achieved', 'Vinton.The', 'Adventures', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'career', 'America', 'premier', 'author', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'stories', 'best-known', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'Becky', 'Thatcher', 'children', 'have', 'stowed', 'away', 'Twain', 'airship', 'piloting', 'rendezvous', 'Halley', 'Comet', 'stories', 'are', 'connected', 'background', 'narrative', 'consisting', 'largely', 'direct', 'quotes', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'who', 'perhaps', 'now', 'better', 'known', 'pithy', 'cynical', 'comments', 'books', 'one', 'quotes', 'states', 'Classic', 'books', 'are', 'people', 'want', 'have', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'read', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'first', 'published', 'story', 'was', 'Celebrated', 'Jumping', 'Frog', 'Calaveras', 'County', 'presented', 'first', 'film', 'great', 'majority', 'Twain', 'writing', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'religion', 'four', 'stories', 'highlighted', 'film', 'three', 'are', 'inspired', 'Bible', 'touch', 'obliquely', 'religious', 'themes', 'are', 'shown', 'good', 'humored', 'Diaries', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'then', 'encounter', 'dark', 'Mysterious', 'Stranger', 'stranger', 'identifies', 'Satan', 'Lastly', 'accompany', 'Captain', 'Stormfield', 'visit', 'heaven', 'few', 'viewers', 'unaware', 'Twain', 'religious', 'skepticism', 'are', 'surprised', 'uneasy', 'when', 'find', 'was', ""n't"", 'jumping', 'frog', 'contests', 'whitewashing', 'fences.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'moved', 'viewing', 'Adventures', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'had', 'read', 'Jr.', 'High', 'School', 'everything', 'Twain', 'had', 'written', 'exception', 'suppressed', 'works', 'such', 'Letters', 'Earth', 'was', 'not', 'published', 'many', 'years', 'death', 'visit', 'old', 'old', 'friend', 'film', 'was', 'bittersweet', 'experience', 'Twain', 'works', 'were', 'reflection', 'reality', 'life', 'mixing', 'humor', 'sorrow', 'perfect', 'example', 'duality', 'taken', 'Diaries', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'where', 'lifetime', 'comical', 'adventures', 'Adam', 'last', 'words', 'diary', 'following', 'death', 'Eve', 'was', 'was', 'Eden']",Adventures of Mark Twain VHS
254428,A26O0T192IBKY1,6301505638,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","Will Vinton, creator of the California Raisin commercials, spearheaded this claymation movie which was originally meant for children, but has been notorious over the years for its rather creepy imagery. Mark Twain near the end of his life plans an expedition to catch up with Haley's Comet in his custom airship, but didn't count on three stowaways: Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, and Beck Thatcher(who aren't fictional here). The inside of the airship is leads to several different short stories that Twain wrote, including the steampunk classic of Captain Stormfield. There is some deep metaphysical and philosophic material going on here, like Twain's duality with his dark side coming to life, and the nightmarish conversation with Satan himself.

254429,A140XH16IKR4B0,6301505638,Jean E. Pouliot,"[7, 11]","Will Vinton brings his creative genius to the task of bringing complexity and depth to the work of Mark Twain. He does this via putting his Claymation Twain on a hot air steamship to rendezvous with Halley's Comet in 1910, the year of Twain's death. Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher stow away and are subject to Twain's wry observations and humor. Unbeknownst to the kids, Twain's evil twin is also on board, trying to scuttle the journey. The confusion between the works and words of ""light"" Twain and ""dark"" Twain account for some of the journey's dramatic moments.I would have expected a Twain film to highlight Twain's great works - Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. But these are mostly missing, except for a terrifying cameo by Injun Joe. Instead, Twain's lesser known, more difficult and adult-oriented works are highlighted - Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven, The Diary of Adam and Eve and Letters from the Earth. The last, with a terrifying Satan playing life and death games with little clay people, is extremely dark and creepy.Kudos to Vinton for trying to being the ""real"" Twain to life. And kudos with bringing Twain's more difficult works to public notice. Bravo for putting Twain's own sayings into this character's mouth -- though some, like ""as surprised as a Presbyterian in Hell"" are dated and almost impossible to comprehend. Congrats also with showing a man in his humorous and evil-tempered sides. Congrats also for daring to poke pointed fun at Heaven and Hell with any audience.But is this a kid's movie? The subtitle, ""Where dreams become reality,"" seems to suggest this, but is pretty misleading. There is nothing in the story about dreams becoming true -- other than Twain's morbid expectation that he would go out with the comet as he came in with it. And the odd choice of offbeat Twain material makes this a poor choice for introducing kids to the great author. Not to mention that what was included would be nightmare materials for many kids. I think even some 12-year-olds would find this stuff too much to handle.Yet ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" is extremely well made and innovative, if a bit pokey in the dialog. If anything, it will give non-kids a sense of the mature (and often religious) themes that obsessed Twain. Watch the movie, then pick up ""The gospel according to Mark Twain"" to get the full treatment of his often funny, often insightful musings about religion.",2,"Good intro to Twain's darker, stranger works -- but for kids?",1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,2415,"['Will', 'Vinton', 'brings', 'creative', 'genius', 'task', 'bringing', 'complexity', 'depth', 'work', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'putting', 'Claymation', 'Twain', 'hot', 'air', 'steamship', 'rendezvous', 'Halley', 'Comet', '1910', 'year', 'Twain', 'death', 'Huck', 'Finn', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Becky', 'Thatcher', 'stow', 'away', 'are', 'subject', 'Twain', 'wry', 'observations', 'humor', 'Unbeknownst', 'kids', 'Twain', 'evil', 'twin', 'also', 'board', 'trying', 'scuttle', 'journey', 'confusion', 'works', 'words', 'light', 'Twain', 'dark', 'Twain', 'account', 'journey', 'dramatic', 'moments.I', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Twain', 'film', 'highlight', 'Twain', 'great', 'Huck', 'Finn', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'are', 'mostly', 'missing', 'terrifying', 'cameo', 'Injun', 'Joe', 'Instead', 'Twain', 'lesser', 'known', 'more', 'difficult', 'adult-oriented', 'works', 'are', 'highlighted', 'Captain', 'Stormfield', 'Visit', 'Heaven', 'Diary', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'Letters', 'Earth', 'last', 'terrifying', 'Satan', 'playing', 'life', 'death', 'games', 'little', 'clay', 'people', 'extremely', 'dark', 'creepy.Kudos', 'Vinton', 'trying', 'being', 'real', 'Twain', 'life', 'kudos', 'bringing', 'Twain', 'more', 'difficult', 'works', 'public', 'notice', 'Bravo', 'putting', 'Twain', 'own', 'sayings', 'character', 'mouth', 'like', 'as', 'surprised', 'Presbyterian', 'Hell', 'are', 'dated', 'almost', 'impossible', 'comprehend', 'Congrats', 'also', 'showing', 'man', 'humorous', 'evil-tempered', 'sides', 'Congrats', 'also', 'daring', 'poke', 'pointed', 'fun', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'audience.But', 'kid', 'movie', 'subtitle', 'Where', 'become', 'reality', 'suggest', 'pretty', 'misleading', 'nothing', 'story', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'true', 'other', 'Twain', 'morbid', 'expectation', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'comet', 'came', 'odd', 'choice', 'offbeat', 'Twain', 'material', 'poor', 'choice', 'introducing', 'kids', 'great', 'author', 'Not', 'mention', 'what', 'was', 'included', 'would', 'be', 'nightmare', 'materials', 'many', 'kids', 'think', 'even', '12-year-olds', 'would', 'find', 'stuff', 'too', 'much', 'handle.Yet', 'Adventures', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'innovative', 'bit', 'pokey', 'dialog', 'anything', 'will', 'give', 'non-kids', 'sense', 'mature', 'often', 'religious', 'themes', 'obsessed', 'Twain', 'Watch', 'movie', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'gospel', 'according', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'get', 'full', 'treatment', 'often', 'funny', 'often', 'insightful', 'musings', 'religion']",Adventures of Mark Twain VHS

The premise is that three youngsters--Tom, Huck and Becky from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer--stow away on a fantastic lighter-than-air craft piloted by Mark Twain, who was born during a year when Halley's Comet visited our atmosphere and is trying to join up with it during one of its return visits. As he puts it, the Lord noted that those two freaks of nature came in together, and they should go out together. Along the way, the kids start to question the outcome of the trip and plot to hijack the ship. They also encounter several of Twain's short stories that are dramatized as subplots, a couple of which end up revealing crucial aspects of Twain's own character. The Clamation effects are a knockout, highly imaginative, and the plot has more substance than you might think on first approaching it.

It stumbles upon Marks other adult oriented works, and adds this weird devils game or something, IDK. Knowing how his other novels are, I guess they wanted to keep the films context in the same vein. But there is one problem with that method, MOST KIDS NEVER READ ANYTHING BEYOND TOM SAWYER AND HUCK FLINT. So if your trying to get yer kids to read MT novels, and introduce them to this, they'll say ""this is stuped, i'ma playing COD Black Opps"".I dig the Claymation work while its not perfect, but it is far more appealing than some bland CGI rework with the clay model rendered in digital (looking at you 2000s Fireman Sam). You'll like this film if you know and examined Twains novels, or if you are drunk or high and like to see some weird s*** during your ""phases"".I'm reviewing the MGM DVD release from circa 2005. Extras: Trailer reel for Sony family films. What bugs me here is the case states the films original theatrical is here, but it is not unless I missed it in that crappy excuse of a trailer reel. Audio is ENG DD 3.0 LFE which is serviceable, and has English and French subs. The English subs are SERIOUSLY messed up and have grammar and spelling issues. I guess MGM/Sony at one time got so aphetic that they ether had someone with 3rd rate English do the subs, as they were too lazy and greedy to spend a damn on a title like this. The source it comes from is a nice, clean master that has some grain and very little specks & hairs. The digital transfer however, is another one of MGM/Sony's interlaced failures. The combing is noticeable, but it not as bad as some of their other titles and AT LEAST its free of mooring and banding (The 2005 release of The Mask Of Zorro had a HORRENDOUS transfer. ""High Definition Remaster"", MY A$$!!).I am aware of the recent release from Magnolia Entertainment. Surprisingly, there is not a lot of information on that release but from what I gathered it is supposedly better than the MGM release.

The issues of mortality, deity, and the afterlife itself are addressed throughout in all kinds of ways, particularly in the diaries of Adam and Eve.  I actually read Twain's rendering of their diaries in a 1995 edition of ""Essays and Sketches of Mark Twain,"" and they're just as amusing in clay figure depiction as they are in print.  The scene at the end of the segment showing how their love has grown with age is wonderfully touching.Twain's unique mixture of high brow wisdom with low brow character is beautifully captured in his convincing claymation character by the many sprinkled-in quotes.  Quite frequently he made me laugh.But he made me think too, particularly in the exceedingly dark and nihilistic ""Mysterious Stranger"" sequence that is very hard to avoid mentioning in any review. I don't want to go into it any further than necessary, but I want to say that when I saw the scene on youtube, I knew I had to check out the whole film.Personally, I think the content is more PG than G, but sometimes it's tough to make a distinction between the two ratings.
