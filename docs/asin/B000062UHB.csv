How refreshing it was to purchase the DVD and see it for what it is,a truly wonderful film.  The on location photography is excellent and Kirk Douglas delivered his best performance since Spartacus eight years previous.  True,one knows it dates from the sixties but it retains its power and surpisingly is only 96 minutes long.  No movie today can pack as much tension in that time frame without overdoing the drama.

691641,A2MNMZMM6BGLTA,B000062UHB,"Uncle Chino ""Johnny""","[9, 13]",This movie was actually made before the Godfather and stands right beside it in its storey and performances. Kirk Douglas is wonderful and believable as a Mafia Don. There are a lot of parallels to Copollas movie. Some may try to compare the two and view it as dated but if you keep an open mind and view it on its own merits it is a great movie about the Mafia and organized crime in the United States. The only gleeming weakness that I personally found was Alex Cord. He does as good a job as he can but his acting ability is not up to par with the others in this wonderful moving movie.,5,Brilliant!...,1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,589,"['movie', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'Godfather', 'stands', 'right', 'storey', 'performances', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'wonderful', 'believable', 'Mafia', 'Don', 'are', 'lot', 'parallels', 'Copollas', 'movie', 'may', 'try', 'compare', 'two', 'view', 'dated', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'view', 'own', 'merits', 'great', 'movie', 'Mafia', 'organized', 'crime', 'United', 'States', 'only', 'gleeming', 'weakness', 'personally', 'found', 'was', 'Alex', 'Cord', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'can', 'acting', 'ability', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'others', 'wonderful', 'moving', 'movie']",N/A
