So glad the movie version will be out in May but until then we can watch these great episodes again and again. Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon won much deserved Emmy's that year. Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis also sparkle the last season as well, Samantha is diagnosed with breast cancer and falls in love with Smith, while Charlotte becomes a mother to a King Charles Springer Spaniel and a baby from China. Chris Noth returns as Big to finally win Carrie back and we learn Big's first name! and Miranda marries Steve and they purchase a house in Brooklyn. Hard to find a show where all six seasons are brilliant and never jumped the shark.

Luckily, I had the Season 6 Part 2 on Demand on cable and have seen each episode at least 5 times.Out of all the seasons, Season 6 is my favorite. Season 5 was a bit dark and introspective for all of the girls but in Season 6 things start to come together. Part 2 is filled with nostalgia as it seems the producers knew that the series was coming to an end and wanted to imbue it with the best they had yet. The Part 2 introduces a new man in Carrie's life after Berger leaves - Petrovsky who is a Russian artist. For those of you who may not have seen it earlier I don't want to give spoilers but Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte all seem to have come of age in this season and seem relatively well settled in their lives.The last 2 episodes are my very favorite, as they bring together all of the characters in a very nostalgic fashion and I must admit some scenes in the very last episode had me wiping a tear...the music score was absolutely wonderful complementing the setting.

Particularly with the BEST episode of the entire series ever (beating My Motherboard, Myself from season 4, which, believe me, was no small feat in the excellent series), in American Girl in Paris Part Deux.  That episode alone makes this a worthwhile purchase.The Series wrapped up with many nice surprises.  Charlotte's new passion was not only fitting, but really suited the 'new' Charlotte.  Miranda's acceptance of the consequences of her new life were masterfully played by Cynthia Nixon.  Catrall...Dear LORD how talented is this woman?  Her protrayal of Samantha in the most serious stages of her illness was classic Samantha, but with a vulnerability never seen in this character. (Particularly the Samantha/Smith relationship and it's very natural development.)  And, of course, SJP wraps up the chapter of Carries life in a very acceptable fashion.The series' end was handled wonderfully and respectably for all involved (no miracle pregnancy for charlotte, no Carrie's Wedding).  This is fine television at it's best, and any series fan will have to own this, just on principle alone.That being said, I agree with the earlier review who said HBO isn't real 'user friendly' when it comes to programming their DVD's.  I'd like to be able to watch one episode after another, but ya gotta keep running back and forth between menus.  And, as I said in this episode's predecessor review...Why only half a season?  What????  But, now that you have both parts, it makes it a whole.  A pricey whole in relation to the other, full-season-in-one-package wholes, but at least complete.Now, one gripe I have moreso with this portion of the series was Mikhail Barishnikov's character.  I could never warm up to him, and aside from providing some kinda father figure 'thing', I couldn't see why in the world Carrie would have ever been attracted to him, much less moved to Paris with him!  That was the only part I found slightly 'off' in an otherwise perfect season.But, the best twenty minutes of writing happen in the last section of the last episode, and I cannot fathom how any fan of this series or these characters doesn't require at least 5 hankies to make it through.

At it best, the genre mines wrinkles in a character that add depth, but do not change the basic persona.""Sex & the City"" was one of the greatest TV comedies of all time.  However, it faced many of the same problems that faced other great TV comedies ending their run. It had four interesting characters that were original, but had become comic archtypes over the run of the series.  It also had an audience in seeing those characters get a '... happily ever after' moment that did not betray everything that had come before.The focus on relationships as a source of comedy gave the series something to work with entering its final season that many comedies did not have.  However, the series resolved its characters with very mixed results.  From worst to best:4.  Charlotte - The writers decided that her value system was in need of changing.  As a result, she is paired with a near opposite in Harry.  To make this match, the prim and Waspy Charlotte is forced to leave most of what she values behind.3. Carrie - Is presented with a false choice between an under-developed Russian and her central, series-long romantic interest of Mr. Big.  Gee ... I wonder who she chose?  Also, tons of over the top set-up dialouge.2.  Samantha - The cancer is handled far better than you might have feared.  Also, she resolves her relationship in a manner consistent with her character.1.  Mirannda - This character actually evolved over the course of the show.

854410,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B00030M9OW,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[8, 12]","SATC's last eight episodes differ markedly from the earlier shows of the series and we get a healthy sense of closure. The ""girls"" have matured. Each builds on her strengths -- the preppy Charlotte, sexy Samantha and brainy Miranda -- to find long-term relationships with terrific, supportive men.Except (so far) Carrie!  Ironically, Carrie attracts strong sophisticated men, while retaining a rather naive, unsophisticated perspective.  Although her character is fun to watch, she doesn't gain confidence and she's culturally narrow.  Whether with Big or ""The Russian,"" she's outclassed.The arc of Carrie's story could be a case study in life transition. As a career consultant, I've met people who, like Carrie, make momentous decisions in the name of love, family and relationships.  Often they're fearful of being alone (like Carrie) or they feel they owe someone a major sacrifice.As Carrie soon learns, moving changes the dynamics of a relationship -- especially if earning patterns change too. And once on his own turf, her lover becomes less attentive and even less sensitive than he was in New York.  I've known many people who divorced soon after a life-changing move. She also sees a rather mean side of him: he's manipulative. When she starts to make her own friends in Paris, his ""anxiety attack"" keeps her close by. He seems to view girlfriends as objects to purchase and enjoy for awhile. That's fine for the right girl but not Carrie.Like many highly successful people, Carrie viewed her world as either-or. Either stay in New York or move to Paris. She could have insisted on a trial period in Paris, without giving up her job.  Or she could have done a lot more research. And her situation was extremely precarious: Alexander didn't invite marriage, and they didn't seem to have any sort of legal contract (which would be tricky to enforce internationally, anyway). So she could be left high and dry after five or ten years, forced to start over, with Alexander owing her nothing.  And at 38, there's more than a biological clock ticking: there's a work clock, too.  Job are a lot harder to get at 45 than 35.The ending left me satisfied because the next chapter in these women's lives would call for a totally different kind of show. Miranda's buried in family responsibilities; Samantha's settling down with her almost-too-good-to-be-true lover; Charlotte's got dogs and, eventually motherhood.  A sitcom about play dates and family may be fun -- but different.  The upbeat New York energy of this show would have to change.The writers should be congratulated for taking on tough issues while keeping us entertained.",5,From independent professional to trailing spouse,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,2636,"['SATC', 'last', 'eight', 'episodes', 'differ', 'markedly', 'earlier', 'shows', 'series', 'get', 'healthy', 'sense', 'closure', 'girls', 'have', 'matured', 'builds', 'strengths', 'preppy', 'Charlotte', 'sexy', 'Samantha', 'brainy', 'Miranda', 'find', 'long-term', 'relationships', 'terrific', 'supportive', 'men.Except', 'so', 'far', 'Carrie', 'Ironically', 'Carrie', 'strong', 'sophisticated', 'men', 'retaining', 'rather', 'naive', 'unsophisticated', 'perspective', 'character', 'fun', 'watch', ""n't"", 'gain', 'confidence', 'culturally', 'narrow', 'Big', 'Russian', 'outclassed.The', 'arc', 'Carrie', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'case', 'study', 'life', 'transition', 'career', 'consultant', ""'ve"", 'met', 'people', 'who', 'Carrie', 'make', 'momentous', 'decisions', 'name', 'love', 'family', 'relationships', ""'re"", 'fearful', 'being', 'alone', 'Carrie', 'feel', 'owe', 'someone', 'major', 'sacrifice.As', 'Carrie', 'soon', 'moving', 'changes', 'dynamics', 'relationship', 'especially', 'earning', 'patterns', 'change', 'too', 'once', 'own', 'turf', 'lover', 'becomes', 'less', 'attentive', 'even', 'less', 'sensitive', 'was', 'New', 'York', ""'ve"", 'known', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'divorced', 'soon', 'life-changing', 'move', 'also', 'rather', 'mean', 'side', 'manipulative', 'When', 'make', 'own', 'friends', 'Paris', 'anxiety', 'attack', 'close', 'view', 'girlfriends', 'objects', 'purchase', 'enjoy', 'awhile', 'fine', 'right', 'girl', 'not', 'Carrie.Like', 'many', 'highly', 'successful', 'people', 'Carrie', 'viewed', 'world', 'either-or', 'stay', 'New', 'York', 'move', 'Paris', 'could', 'have', 'insisted', 'trial', 'period', 'Paris', 'giving', 'up', 'job', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'more', 'research', 'situation', 'was', 'extremely', 'precarious', 'Alexander', 'did', ""n't"", 'invite', 'marriage', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'sort', 'legal', 'contract', 'would', 'be', 'tricky', 'enforce', 'internationally', 'anyway', 'could', 'be', 'left', 'high', 'dry', 'five', 'ten', 'years', 'forced', 'start', 'Alexander', 'owing', 'nothing', '38', 'more', 'biological', 'clock', 'ticking', 'work', 'clock', 'too', 'Job', 'are', 'lot', 'harder', 'get', '45', '35.The', 'ending', 'left', 'satisfied', 'next', 'chapter', 'women', 'lives', 'would', 'call', 'totally', 'different', 'kind', 'show', 'Miranda', 'buried', 'family', 'responsibilities', 'Samantha', 'settling', 'down', 'almost-too-good-to-be-true', 'lover', 'Charlotte', 'got', 'dogs', 'eventually', 'motherhood', 'sitcom', 'play', 'dates', 'family', 'may', 'be', 'fun', 'different', 'upbeat', 'New', 'York', 'energy', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'change.The', 'writers', 'should', 'be', 'congratulated', 'taking', 'tough', 'issues', 'keeping', 'entertained']",N/A

When I first heard of the three alternate endings along with deleted scenes for all the episodes, I thought- Awesome! After watching these bonus features, I found them to be a bit of a let down. The alternate endings all seemed to be more like deleted scenes rather than alt. endings. They didn't seem to have much thought put into them, at least not as much as I expected. All 3 endings were all just different dialogue in that last scene in the coffee shop. The outcome of Carrie's life were very different in each scene but it was like they came up with the ending at the last second for fun. They didnt even bother to explain how they got to that point. I would have been more satisfied with that if there was an audio commentary included with the deleted scenes and ""alt. endings"" but there were none. This is the last DVD of the whole season. I didn't think it was too much to ask, as an avid Sex fan, to make this one awesome and worth the 35-40 bucks they charge for it. I feel like they just kind of threw the material together with a commentary here and there for some choice episodes, threw some ""bonus features"" together which I found to be so half-assed, and charge top dollar for it even though it only had 8 episodes.

And as delusionary as it may seem, it probably gives hope to many women that their man will eventually come around and realize their worth, and grow to love them.  The inner romantic within me responded with a resounding ""yes"".Carrie's ending was romantic, just as she deserved.  One interesting thing I noted was that in Season 6 for the first time, Carrie didn't act neurotic and crazy for a relationship.  She seemed so much more mature, even though Mikhail acted the spoiled brat.  It felt good to see her progress and grow.  As for Miranda, the life she ended up with felt wholesome and complete for me, like she learned what was truly important for her own life.  The part with Steve's mom losing her mind was so beautifully done, you couldn't help but empathize with her.I know that introducing a cancer storyline can seem forced and campy, but the way they did it in SITC seemed pretty good.  It didn't overwhelm the other storylines, which is something I appreciated.All in all, a great finish to a great show.  I know alot of people are upset at the price and it being split into two seasons, but it costs alot of money to make these shows.  Their profits will go toward producing more quality shows, and I will gladly pay more money for HBO to do this.

It could be the end of one series, or the start of a new series.One theory I had throughout watching the show (which I did not watch on HBO during its run, but started watching via DVD after the show ended its run), was that none of the women other than Carrie actually existed, that they were all various aspects of a whole personality. A viewer often wonders how the women could have ever met or become friends without a catalyst.  For example, when or where would Samantha and Charlotte have met without completely hating each other at first sight? One Amazon reviewer said, rightly, that Carrie seemed to be always outclassed by her men, Big and Russian in particular.  But when you combine all the women into a whole person, you get someone who would be a match for anyone or anything, including the City of New York.  Yes, it's rather Freudian, with Samantha playing the Id, Charlotte the Ego, and Miranda the Super-ego.  Or maybe Jungian, with each woman being an archetype - Carrie being the child who needs the other 3 archetypes to become a fully realized adult.  S&TC; never resorted to such gimmicks, but Season Six carries enough symbology that such a theory is possible without ever being overt.All the characters were so delightful, from the primaries to the cameos. The 4 women all have to make difficult choices, and must give up something in order to gain something so much better.

There will never be another series like it on television. Like the ""Golden Girls"" in the eighties and nineties, ""Sex and the City"" dealt with the issue of female friendship and how those relationships are important when people are going through life's troubles, and the fact that no matter what life throws your way, as long as you have friends you will overcome everyday obstacles.In this box set that features the last ten shows Carrie starts to date a Russian artist named Petrovsky, who sweeps her off her feet and off to Paris near the end of the season; Charlotte marries Harry, but discovers she has miscarried. The two then adopt a beautiful dog named Elizabeth Taylor when Charlotte discovers she can never carry children full term; Miranda marries Steve and moves to Brooklyn with Brady where she cares for Steve's sick mother; and perhaps most touching this season Samantha discovers she has breast cancer and is fearful Smith will leave her.The final episode entitled ""An American Girl in Paris, Part Deux"" was the highest rated episode in the series' run bringing in over ten million viewers, making ""Sex and the City""s finale one of the highest rated in televison history.",5,"""Here's The End Of A Classic Series""",1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,1289,"['six', 'seasons', 'air', '94', 'episodes', 'filmed', 'Sex', 'City', 'came', 'conclusion', '2004', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'series', 'television', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'eighties', 'nineties', 'Sex', 'City', 'dealt', 'issue', 'female', 'friendship', 'how', 'relationships', 'are', 'important', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'life', 'troubles', 'fact', 'matter', 'what', 'life', 'way', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'friends', 'will', 'overcome', 'everyday', 'box', 'set', 'last', 'ten', 'Carrie', 'date', 'Russian', 'artist', 'named', 'Petrovsky', 'who', 'off', 'feet', 'Paris', 'end', 'season', 'Charlotte', 'marries', 'Harry', 'miscarried', 'two', 'then', 'adopt', 'beautiful', 'dog', 'named', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'can', 'never', 'carry', 'children', 'full', 'term', 'Miranda', 'marries', 'Steve', 'moves', 'Brooklyn', 'Brady', 'where', 'Steve', 'sick', 'mother', 'perhaps', 'most', 'touching', 'season', 'Samantha', 'breast', 'cancer', 'fearful', 'Smith', 'will', 'leave', 'her.The', 'final', 'episode', 'entitled', 'American', 'Girl', 'Paris', 'Part', 'Deux', 'was', 'highest', 'rated', 'episode', 'series', 'run', 'bringing', 'ten', 'million', 'viewers', 'making', 'Sex', 'City', 's', 'finale', 'one', 'highest', 'rated', 'televison', 'history']",N/A

Ah, it was the Fleet Week episode. As she walks away from the visiting Louisiana sailor who really didn't care for NYC, she says, in a voiceover, ""I can't have *no one* [sic] talking s--t about my boyfriend.""I must say, in the tributes, Sarah Jessica Parker looks far more beautiful than Carrie did in all six seasons.I took a star off because of the too-frequent commentary by the insufferable Kathy Griffin (and really, once would have been too much). Really, what was she doing there? Or, for that matter, Ivanka Trump or Heidi Klum?If you were a series fan, this is obviously something you want to buy. People say different things about the finale, but I thought it was just perfect, extremely emotionally satisfying.One of the commentators I did enjoy was series semi-regular Mario (""Anthony"") Cantone, who made short work of women who come up to him and say ""I'M CARRIE!!!""
