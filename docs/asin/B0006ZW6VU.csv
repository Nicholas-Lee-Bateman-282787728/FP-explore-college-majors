875973,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B0006ZW6VU,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 0]",Luce dei miei occhi (Light of My Eyes) is Giuseppe Piccioni's study in lonliness.The film which won multiple awards at the Venice Film Festival is one of the most realistic love stories that I've seen in recent memory.Luigi Lo Casio plays Antonio a chauffer in Rome who spends most of his lonely existence reading science fiction novels until an almost accident one night introduces him to Maria (Sandra Ceccarelli) a mother who is struggling to get by and to preserve her family. Maria is in her own right just as lonely as Antonio and the two strike up a precarious friendship. Antonio wanting more begins to pay her bills and to spend more time with both Maria nd her young daughter Maria. Maria however is too locked into her own problems to reciprocate the affection.All in all a very good film it does have some problems with its rather difficult screenplay. The voiceover narration from Antonio's science fiction stories could have been tightened a bit and a plot involving some minor criminality could have been explained a little better.This is the fifth film in Film Movement's ongoing series and is worth watching. The film is presented in standard definition and has a short making of documentary and is presented with the short Dreamscapes.,4,Two Lonely People,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,1253,"['Luce', 'dei', 'miei', 'occhi', 'Light', 'My', 'Eyes', 'Giuseppe', 'Piccioni', 'study', 'lonliness.The', 'film', 'won', 'multiple', 'awards', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'love', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'memory.Luigi', 'Lo', 'Casio', 'Antonio', 'chauffer', 'Rome', 'who', 'most', 'lonely', 'existence', 'reading', 'science', 'fiction', 'novels', 'almost', 'accident', 'one', 'night', 'Maria', 'Sandra', 'Ceccarelli', 'mother', 'who', 'struggling', 'get', 'preserve', 'family', 'Maria', 'own', 'right', 'just', 'as', 'lonely', 'Antonio', 'two', 'strike', 'precarious', 'friendship', 'Antonio', 'wanting', 'more', 'begins', 'pay', 'bills', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'Maria', 'nd', 'young', 'daughter', 'Maria', 'Maria', 'however', 'too', 'locked', 'own', 'problems', 'reciprocate', 'affection.All', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'have', 'problems', 'rather', 'difficult', 'screenplay', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'Antonio', 'science', 'fiction', 'stories', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'bit', 'plot', 'involving', 'minor', 'criminality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'little', 'better.This', 'fifth', 'film', 'Film', 'Movement', 'ongoing', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'presented', 'standard', 'definition', 'short', 'making', 'documentary', 'presented', 'short', 'Dreamscapes']",N/A
875974,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B0006ZW6VU,CriticNic,"[0, 0]","I often think of myself as a bit of an outsider. From my childhood I always felt like I was somehow different than other people. For this I have always liked movies with characters that have a similar disposition. Not only can I relate to the characters but I always find them to be more genuine and meaningful. Antonio (Luigi Lo Cascio) is such a character in Guiseppe Piccioni's clever tale of a loner who suddenly falls in love.Antonio is a driver by profession, chauffeuring luxury cars for wealthy clientele. We're given the assumption that he has no family around, and his only friends seem to be his co-workers with whom he only associates with during work hours. He's a good worker, reliable and always on time. Because he doesn't have a lot of commitments he rarely says no to anyone, which leads him to be taken advantage of a bit.New purpose is suddenly brought into Antonio's life when he encounters a young girl named Lisa (Barbara Valente) one night when she jumps in front of his car. When he checks on her, Maria (Sandra Ceccarelli), Lisa's mother, arrives on the scene and Antonio is immediately drawn to her. His attraction for her comes off a bit creepy when he does things like joins them at their table in a restaurant when they run into each other. I couldn't help but wonder why Maria was so accepting of his initial creeper behavior, but as we learn more about her it is apparent she appreciates the fact that he's nice to her if nothing else.What's most interesting about this film is its approach to the narration. The story runs parallel with a science fiction novel, one not unlike those that Antonio is fond of. The novel's story is about an intergalactic traveler named Morgan, an outsider observing and trying to understand the world's he visits. Antonio and Morgan could be one and the same, loners searching for meaning in their lives. This unique style of storytelling drew me in immediately and gave the story a nice and different perspective.The character of Maria is a complex one as well. She resists Antonio, but also keeps him close. Her story draws some similarities to that of Morgan's observations of people. Like Antonio/Morgan, she is searching for that something to make her life complete, but when she gets close to it she hesitates. I wanted to hate her, for playing with Antonio's emotions, but at the same time I had sympathy for her. She is a strong and independent woman who's faced a lot of misfortune. She wants and deserves to be happy, but fears failure.Light of My Eyes is a poetic journey of love and personal struggle. The clever manner by which it is told enhances the experience by adding a different and thought-provoking perspective. There's a scene where Antonio tells Lisa to ask strangers about their memories. If they can't remember, they aren't who they once were. There are many such notions in the film that cause us to explore our own lives.The characters of the film symbolize many, if not all of us. We're constantly searching for something, that completeness. We often drift into cyclic pattern of existence which sometimes causes us to forget what was once important to us. The longer we go through the motions, the harder it is to get back to our original pursuit. Sometimes it takes us to view ourselves as if we are visitors from another planet, like Morgan, to realize we all deserve happiness and that we should never let it go when we find it.This is a very well handled film that is not only a quirky and original romantic drama, but also a thought provoking examination of people and the paths we take. The beautifully fitting music and cinematography enhance the emotion felt throughout the story and everything combined makes the whole thing feel kind of magical. This is the kind of romance film I wish there were more of.Source: criticnic.com 25-April-2012Disclosure: Film sent from Film Movement",5,Clever and poetic,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,3883,"['often', 'think', 'bit', 'outsider', 'childhood', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'somehow', 'different', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'movies', 'characters', 'have', 'similar', 'disposition', 'Not', 'only', 'can', 'relate', 'characters', 'always', 'find', 'be', 'more', 'genuine', 'meaningful', 'Antonio', 'Luigi', 'Lo', 'Cascio', 'such', 'character', 'Guiseppe', 'Piccioni', 'clever', 'tale', 'loner', 'who', 'suddenly', 'love.Antonio', 'driver', 'profession', 'chauffeuring', 'luxury', 'cars', 'wealthy', 'clientele', ""'re"", 'given', 'assumption', 'family', 'around', 'only', 'friends', 'seem', 'be', 'co-workers', 'whom', 'only', 'work', 'hours', 'good', 'worker', 'reliable', 'always', 'time', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'commitments', 'rarely', 'anyone', 'be', 'taken', 'advantage', 'bit.New', 'purpose', 'suddenly', 'brought', 'Antonio', 'life', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Lisa', 'Barbara', 'Valente', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'front', 'car', 'When', 'Maria', 'Sandra', 'Ceccarelli', 'Lisa', 'mother', 'scene', 'Antonio', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'attraction', 'off', 'bit', 'creepy', 'when', 'things', 'joins', 'table', 'restaurant', 'when', 'run', 'other', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'Maria', 'was', 'so', 'accepting', 'initial', 'creeper', 'behavior', 'learn', 'more', 'apparent', 'fact', 'nice', 'nothing', 'else.What', 'most', 'interesting', 'film', 'approach', 'narration', 'story', 'parallel', 'science', 'fiction', 'novel', 'one', 'not', 'Antonio', 'fond', 'novel', 'story', 'intergalactic', 'traveler', 'named', 'Morgan', 'outsider', 'observing', 'trying', 'understand', 'world', 'Antonio', 'Morgan', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'same', 'loners', 'searching', 'meaning', 'lives', 'unique', 'style', 'storytelling', 'drew', 'immediately', 'gave', 'story', 'nice', 'different', 'perspective.The', 'character', 'Maria', 'complex', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Antonio', 'also', 'close', 'story', 'similarities', 'Morgan', 'observations', 'people', 'Antonio/Morgan', 'searching', 'something', 'make', 'life', 'complete', 'when', 'close', 'wanted', 'hate', 'playing', 'Antonio', 'emotions', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'sympathy', 'strong', 'independent', 'woman', 'who', 'faced', 'lot', 'misfortune', 'be', 'happy', 'fears', 'failure.Light', 'My', 'Eyes', 'poetic', 'journey', 'love', 'personal', 'struggle', 'clever', 'manner', 'told', 'enhances', 'experience', 'adding', 'different', 'thought-provoking', 'perspective', 'scene', 'where', 'Antonio', 'Lisa', 'ask', 'strangers', 'memories', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'are', ""n't"", 'who', 'once', 'were', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'notions', 'film', 'cause', 'explore', 'own', 'lives.The', 'characters', 'film', 'symbolize', 'many', 'not', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'searching', 'something', 'completeness', 'often', 'drift', 'cyclic', 'pattern', 'existence', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'important', 'longer', 'go', 'motions', 'harder', 'get', 'back', 'original', 'pursuit', 'view', 'are', 'visitors', 'planet', 'Morgan', 'realize', 'deserve', 'happiness', 'should', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'when', 'find', 'it.This', 'very', 'well', 'handled', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'quirky', 'original', 'romantic', 'drama', 'also', 'thought', 'provoking', 'examination', 'people', 'paths', 'take', 'beautifully', 'fitting', 'music', 'cinematography', 'enhance', 'emotion', 'felt', 'story', 'everything', 'combined', 'whole', 'thing', 'feel', 'kind', 'magical', 'kind', 'romance', 'film', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'of.Source', 'criticnic.com', '25-April-2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', 'Film', 'Movement']",N/A

The movies is long, but as I stated, not a moment is wasted and it is really a lesson of how a good story can be told and how to keep an audience entranced.I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good Italian movies.

875976,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006ZW6VU,Grady Harp,"[21, 26]","LIGHT OF MY EYES ('Luce dei miei occhi') is more a fantasia on theme of loneliness and need for love than it is a straightforward narrative story.  Under the direction of Giuseppe Piccioni, who co-wrote the screenplay with Umberto Contarello, it shimmers like and extended poem, a theme so delicate and so suffused with melancholy that it remains as an echo long after the film is over.Antonio (Luigi Lo Cascio) is a sweet dreamer who respects his station in life as a chauffeur for customers about Rome, following the rule of 'Know when to talk and when to shut up' his boss has set as the standard.  In his lonely ennui Antonio narrates his life in a voice-over monologue as a man named Morgan, a character with whom he identifies from his science fiction novel. His life takes on some meaning when he prevents an accident from happening with a young girl Lisa (Barbara Valente) who lives a lonely life with her lonely mother Maria (Sandra Ceccarelli) whose life is divided among making a living in a not too successful frozen food shop, a frustrating sexual attachment to a cold married man, and trying to hold her little home together since her husband's absence. Gradually Antonio's act of protecting Lisa is acknowledged by Maria and while Antonio is quite taken with the distant Maria, Maria thanks him in a brief and passionate but isolated sexual experience.  Maria is needy, Antonio is needy, Lisa is needy, but somehow the connection cannot be made: Maria must concentrate on her lack of income to support Lisa.Antonio, seeing the need to assist Maria's financial situation, allows himself to accept a chauffeur job that involves illegal smuggling of foreigners. Maria's response to her desperate situation is to allow Lisa to be cared for by her grandparents.  In a moment suggestive of the old Christmas tale where the man buys combs for his wife's hair while the wife sells her hair to by a gift for her husband, Maria and Antonio face the misunderstanding of their 'friendship' and all seems lost until each  changes a significant event that opens a communal door of caring and hope for something more for the little trio.Both Lo Cascio and Ceccarelli are fine actors and make these difficult roles wholly credible.  The atmosphere of the film is well defined by the adroit camera work of Arnaldo Catinari and enhanced by the musical score by Ludovico Einaudi.  This is one of those very small films that may evade the casual filmgoer not only due to the inappropriately poor DVD cover art but also by the lack of proper promotion. It is a word of mouth success in this country. In Italian with English subtitles.

875977,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0006ZW6VU,Lee Armstrong,"[7, 9]","Director Giuseppe Piccioni directed ""Light of My Eyes.""  He followed this with ""The Life I Want"" in 2004.  This film follows three main characters.  Antonio is played by Luigi LoCascio.  Antonio is a chauffeur who looks on others much as the alien invaders in the pulp fiction novels he reads, people landing as if from another planet with little relation to himself.  Barbara Valente plays the daughter Lisa.  Valente has some nice reactions, but mostly is a cardboard teenager whose world we never really enter.  This was the only film credit I could find for her.  Her mother Maria is played by Sandra Ceccarelli, a self-absorbed woman who obsesses over an apparent affair with a married man who is unable to give her emotional satisfaction.  She frets endlessly over the telephone, ignoring birthday parties and having social services intervene to relocate her daughter with the grandparents.  Early in their relationship, Antonio stays over and makes love to Maria.  From there, the film cools off.  The emotionally alienated characters revolve around each other, not really connecting, until the last frames of the film that might imply a relationship.  LoCascio and Ceccarelli won Best Actor/Actress awards at the Venice Film Festival.  ""Light of My Eyes"" is an interesting film, but at times seems frustrating and trivial as neither character has an ideal that is larger than themselves for which to strive.  As a result, they become endlessly self-absorbed about the details of their lives, which wound up being more fascinating to Piccioni than to me.The Film Movement DVD adds a short called ""Dreamscapes"" by Sean McBride.  McBride interviewed a number of people about their dreams.  He blends them in otherworldly animated images.

His only friends are the fellow drivers and his boss at an elite chauffeur service. She, on the other hand, is struggling to operate a frozen food store while attempting to maintain the good will of children's services social workers who are monitoring her worthiness as a mother.His loneliness and isolation are characterized by the fictional hero of an earthling in a science fiction novel he is reading, who wanders the universe and puzzles over how beings might invade the bodies of others, while being unable to remember the past of the lives they have assumed. ""You are too sentimental,"" the woman tells him when she rejects his affections. Meanwhile, as a driver and errand-runner, he becomes slowly involved in the trafficking of illegal workers, risking all the while the loss of his own job.Told slowly and with unexpected turns, the story is a fascinating study of people you walk by on the street every day, their faces a study in hidden sorrows, fears and hopes.
