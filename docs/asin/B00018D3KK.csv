If you have ever tried to plan the perfect date with that special someone who you really really want to get to know better, give this film a try. You've got to laugh at Stanley and Diana if you've ever been in a similar situation. This movie lets you laugh at yourself and that's always a good thing.Stanley is so stiff and nervous about asking Diana out (a co-worker in his office) it's a wonder she agrees to go out with him at all. He rehearses with a buddy how he will ask her out - but you can't plan a conversation when the other person isn't following a script.  Still Stanley doesn't give up even when the conversation gets off to a rocky start and Diana agrees to go out with him anyway. So Stanley plans the perfect date with the woman of his dreams who he's admired from afar for over a year.On their date Stanely is as stiff and nervous as ever and Diana can tell things are going to be awkward and uncomfortable. To make matters worse they run into this annoying homeless guy named Phil who tags along with them at every step, wreaking havoc with Stanley's carefully laid plans. Will their evening be ruined? Or will Stanley and Diana roll with the punches and turn the unexpected into an opportunity? Does your dream date really want perfect? You'll have to watch this movie to find out.",5,have you ever tried to plan the perfect date?,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,1364,"['rented', 'movie', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'used', 'copy', 'have', 'ever', 'tried', 'plan', 'perfect', 'date', 'special', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'give', 'film', 'try', ""'ve"", 'got', 'laugh', 'Stanley', 'Diana', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'similar', 'situation', 'movie', 'laugh', 'always', 'good', 'thing.Stanley', 'so', 'stiff', 'nervous', 'asking', 'Diana', 'out', 'co-worker', 'office', 'wonder', 'go', 'out', 'buddy', 'how', 'will', 'ask', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'plan', 'conversation', 'when', 'other', 'person', ""n't"", 'following', 'script', 'Still', 'Stanley', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'conversation', 'off', 'rocky', 'start', 'Diana', 'go', 'out', 'anyway', 'So', 'Stanley', 'perfect', 'date', 'woman', 'dreams', 'who', 'admired', 'afar', 'year.On', 'date', 'Stanely', 'stiff', 'nervous', 'ever', 'Diana', 'can', 'tell', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'run', 'annoying', 'homeless', 'guy', 'named', 'Phil', 'who', 'step', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'Stanley', 'carefully', 'laid', 'plans', 'Will', 'evening', 'be', 'ruined', 'will', 'Stanley', 'Diana', 'roll', 'punches', 'turn', 'unexpected', 'opportunity', 'dream', 'date', 'really', 'want', 'perfect', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out']",N/A

At least I could not be upset about spending money to view the DVD.  The movie is about a dorky office guy named Stanley who wants to date the gorgeous new office worker(Denise Richards) named Diana.  Every time he decides to make his move, he loses his confidence.  A year passes before he finally manages to ask her out for a date, a causal date.  Surprise, Surprise she agrees, but she feels the date will be a dud.  The office forms a pool as to how far the date will go.  Stan takes her to dinner, but while he is driving the car he hits a homeless guy named Phil.  They take him to the hospital, and after that they can't seem to lose this guy.  From here chaos ensues, with Phil pretty much following them the whole date.  That's when I start to lose interest.  Phil's character was annoying!!!  His character was supposed to be like cupid or he was to help make things better during the date, but his character was so annoying, so irritating that the film lost any romantic comedy momentum.  Everything he did was not funny and it's a miracle I even finished watching the film.  My hand was itching to grab the remote to forward past Phil's annoying scenes.  Ben Affleck has a supporting role in the film as Michael, and Matt Damon make a cameo about an 1 hour into the film that really was not needed in my opinion.  If you want to be bored to sleep, then rent this movie.  If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, do not watch this movie!!!",1,Third Wheel very boring and annoying!!!,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,1546,"['movie', 'bored', 'tears', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'borrowed', 'Public', 'Library', 'least', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'upset', 'spending', 'money', 'view', 'DVD', 'movie', 'dorky', 'office', 'guy', 'named', 'Stanley', 'who', 'date', 'gorgeous', 'new', 'office', 'worker', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'named', 'Diana', 'Every', 'time', 'make', 'move', 'confidence', 'year', 'finally', 'ask', 'out', 'date', 'causal', 'date', 'Surprise', 'Surprise', 'date', 'will', 'be', 'dud', 'office', 'pool', 'how', 'far', 'date', 'will', 'go', 'Stan', 'dinner', 'driving', 'car', 'homeless', 'guy', 'named', 'Phil', 'take', 'hospital', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'lose', 'guy', 'here', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'Phil', 'pretty', 'much', 'following', 'whole', 'date', 'when', 'start', 'lose', 'interest', 'Phil', 'character', 'was', 'annoying', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'cupid', 'was', 'help', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'date', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'annoying', 'so', 'irritating', 'film', 'lost', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'momentum', 'Everything', 'did', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'miracle', 'even', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'hand', 'was', 'itching', 'grab', 'remote', 'forward', 'Phil', 'annoying', 'scenes', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'Michael', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'make', 'cameo', '1', 'hour', 'film', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'needed', 'opinion', 'want', 'be', 'bored', 'sleep', 'then', 'rent', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

""The Third Wheel,"" which Affleck and Damon produced, along with their trashing of ""Good Will"" in ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" do little to discredit the Goldman Theory.""The Third Wheel"" is okay as a lightweight romantic comedy. Denise Richards is attractive. Luke Wilson is Luke Wilson.  Actor/writer Jay Locopo loves himself so much he wrote a script starring himself as an endearing, mentally challenged Cyrano De Bergerac -- who's really a sly con artist -- who also gets to totally break character during the film's credits, jump into a musical number, and start rapping and breakdancing.Affleck plays a co-worker of Wilson's, who creates a betting pool on the outcome of Wilson's date with Richards.  He sends out an assortment of spies to check on their progress.  Wilson and Richards are having a boring time until Wilson hits Locopo with his car.  Locopo's prized bag of glass animals are shattered.  Richards and Wilson feel guilty and give him a ride to the hospital, and their date gets better because Lacopo is entertainingly stupid.  Damon makes a quick appearance as a jealous ex-boyfriend, having just enough screen time to be humiliated by Lacopo before leaving for work on a better film.  Lacopo turns out to be a con-artist. But it's okay because Richards and Wilson don't mind being manipulated into a forced romance -- they get to levitate into a tree together.  Affleck makes out with a fat girl on a motorcycle.  Everyone starts dancing. I watch ""Curly Sue"" again and burn it.Comedian David Cross guest starred as a character similar to Lacopo's on a few episodes of ""Just Shoot Me,"" only Cross remained a manipulative creep throughout, wanted the girl all for himself, and didn't dance.  He was also a lot funnier.Also, keep an eye out for ""The Gilmore Girls"" Lauren Graham.

794787,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00018D3KK,Tsuyoshi,"[9, 16]","First let me tell you one thing.  Though the film is co-executive produced by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and features these two people, ""The Third Wheel"" is virtually Luke Wilson/Denise Richards romantic comedy.  Ben's role is a supporting one while Matt's is little more than a cameo (you have to wait an hour to see the latter in the film).I said ""romantic comedy,"" but it's not that hilarious film that makes you laugh like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""  The story is about Luke Wilson's character, office working Stanley, who falls in love with Denise Richards' Diana, a new worker in his company.  He wants to date her, but cannot have enough courage to ask, so many days (like one year) have to pass before he finally decides to do it.  And surprisingly, she says OK.So Stan is going to take her out to dinner, but while he was driving a car, he hits a homeless man Phil (Jay Rapoco, also the writer of the film).  Phil seems injured, and cannot be left alone, so Stan and Diana take him to the hospital, but somehow Phil is coming back to them, as if he does not want to leave the two.  And in the meanwhile Stan's co-workers including Michael (Ben Affleck) are monitoring Stan and Diana, betting on how far Stan can get the attention of beautiful Diana.If you have not seen ""The Third Wheel"" at your local theater (in spite of the pretty strong cast), that is no wonder.  The film thinks it is unique and funny, but actually it is neither.  The problem is, Phil, who is the ""third wheel"" of the film title, is really annoying and irritating.  Of course, he should play the part of glue, or cupid, between the couple Stan and Diana, but his presence only damage the feel-good sense that this kind of film has to have.  Moreover, what he does is too tame; what he says is not original; but we are supposed to be amused with him, which I found too impossible.One saving grace is Denise Richards.  Whether or not she can really act, I do not care since the day I saw the 007 film in which she is dressed as nuclear scientist.  But in ""The Third Wheel"" Denise Richards exudes her charm and beauty so naturally that you understand why Stanley fell in love with her at first sight.  Her fans would want to see the way she smiles, or the way she talks here, more on the screen.But she is wasted in this little-seen film, and so is Luke Wilson and Ben Affleck.  Maybe I am too harsh, but ""The Third Wheel"" lacks power, or punch, that makes us care.
