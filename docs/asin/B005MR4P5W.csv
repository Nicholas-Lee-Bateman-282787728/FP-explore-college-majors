This was on point and needs to be discussed more in the African American culture... so many times many look for greener grass instead of caring for what they already have, instead of studying what they already have and making that work.. Many times many people think that they can just start over and every thing will be utopia.. no such thing... but it does make since to keep what you have and work on that..I loved the subject matter, the ending, all the characters did a marvelous job! The story line is reality and on time! Please make more plays like this, because too many times we do not take care of our marriages or home. We neglect them and then turn and want to walk away and say its been this way for a long time...Time to wake up and get right! You will learn so many lessons from this and you will walk away refreshed! You will want more and you will be blessed! Don't miss out on this awesome play! The singing is great, the acting is great! add this to your collection!And remember it is cheaper to take care of your marriage now... Don't let your family, friends, career take over your marriage. Remember the one who has been there for you through it all.******Update!****12/28/2012*************still watching and still love this!**This made for great holiday fun!

1494524,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005MR4P5W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","One thing that may not be immediately evident as you shop Je'Caryous Johnson's ""Cheaper to Keep Her"" is that this is a filmed presentation of a live stage play. There is an audience, the actors are clearly miked, and everything is played to the rafters to the delight of a cheering crowd. ""Cheaper to Keep Her"" recently finished its national tour in over 40 cities, and this is a great way to get in on the fun in case you weren't able to see it live. I think it's fair to say that Johnson's piece plays for broad comedy appeal, as opposed to getting mired down in real relationship drama. It handles some serious topics such as divorce and infidelity (and even glosses over a murder), but it's all done with slapstick enthusiasm by a spirited cast. It's the kind of play where all men are dogs and women exist to tame their wicked ways. It's an easy cliche, to be sure, but the live audience didn't seem to mind as they whooped and hollered in support of the female characters. And as long as you don't expect much seriousness, the play succeeds as lighthearted amusement.Viveca Fox and Brian McKnight play the central married couple at the heart of the plot. Fox is the put-upon beauty who has devoted everything to her man, and McKnight is the selfish lout who doesn't appreciate her. Egged on by their friends, the play unfolds in a man versus woman dynamic that is utterly familiar to anyone who has ever seen a romantic comedy. But with everyone fully committed to larger-than-life performances, it's hard not to get caught up in the spirit. It helps immeasurably that Fox and McKnight are allowed to play off their well known personas (an early joke references her appearance on Dancing with the Stars, and he is allowed to break into song frequently). The play follows the ups and downs of their relationship, as well as supporting actor subplots including trying to conceive and finding unexpected new romance. Nothing will come as much of a surprise, but if you like the leads--you should like the play.In addition to the headliners, ""Cheaper to Keep Her"" benefits tremendously with its other actors. They all seem to understand the bigger is better premise of crowd pleasing showmanship. The actress who plays the lawyer, in fact, attacks every bit that she's given so ferociously--it is arguably the play's funniest performance. ""Cheaper to Keep Her"" may certainly play to a niche market, and Je'Caryous Johnson seems to astutely know who his audience is and what they expect. In this regard, fans of his previous works should be equally taken with this one. But this also has the potential for cross-over appeal, as long as you know what to anticipate. Big exaggerated slapstick rules the day, but it is executed with a fair degree of charm and numerous laughs along the way.

Although they've been married for 10 years, the husband, who is a doctor, still doesn't really knows his wifes wants and dreams; except that she wants a family and he doesn't. She's devoted all of her energy into putting his wants and needs first; which include finally opening up his own private family practice. One day, he comes home and tells her some news that rocks her to the core. With the constant instigating by their friends, we watch as the men and women battle it out for dominance.
