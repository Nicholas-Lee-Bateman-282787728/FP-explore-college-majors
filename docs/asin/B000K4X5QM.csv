1030813,A15L8T3HSJ3WS6,B000K4X5QM,Darren F. Parker,"[11, 13]","""The King Of Queens"" is a great show, I think we all know that. The 6th Season was probably the pinnacle for the show, but the momentum carried over into the 7th Season. For me, this is what I refer to as the beginning of 'The Fat Years' for the character of Carrie Heffernan. The weight gain is never really discussed, so it's kind of like the elephant in the room, no pun intended. Leah Remini (Carrie) got pregnant in real life and she gained a lot of weight during her pregnancy and she showed it a lot. I don't understand why they didn't right her pregnancy into the show, it would have made perfect sense for Doug and Carrie to have a baby together. Just imagine the jealousy and subsequent storylines that would happen with Arthur. Anyway, I just find it distracting because it's never really mentioned that I can remember (I'm just now re-watching the episodes on DVD).Nevertheless, it's a great show and this season is really good.

One of my favorite episodes in this set here is when Doug has to work in the Chinese restaurant that he's renting an apartment above (Apartment Complex). This guy is so funny.

Whereas, Raymond is a cowering p-whipped coward in most anything he does; at least Doug has a personality and actually stands up to Carrie (most of the time).  And Doug has real class when he takes care of a baby, to prove to Carrie that he can be a great father. Very touching moments in the episode ""Fresh Brood"".Yes, these are the episodes where Carrie is chubby from pregnancy, but Leah Remini has been and still is beautiful. Carrie complements Doug so much with her rough and tough talk. She and Kirstie Alley are particularly hilarious in their segment of the aforementioned episode ""Apartment Complex.""
