450132,A1166FE81ADOUR,6305128324,50s sci-fi Fan,"[5, 5]","Friendly Persuasion (1956) is my favorite 1950s movie. It always reminds me of Fiddler on the Roof (1971) as both films have analogous existentialist values; questions of faith, meaning and test of personal resolve. Tevye the Milkman must face the challenge to his sense of self and traditional way of doing things, by the increasingly independent ways his three daughters go about selecting a husband. Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) and his family must face the challenge to their pacifist Quaker values by the personal demands of the American Civil War.But this is a review of Friendly Persuasion, so let's confine ourselves to discussion the William Wyler film. It is 1862 and Jess Birdwell and his family are farmers in south Indiana. The harbinger of danger is Maj. Harvey (Theodore Newton), who visits a Quaker Meeting House to warn of approaching Confederate raiders. He has ""had the duty placed upon [him] by the army"" to urge Quakers to take up arms. It is a tense scene, but the gentle humor pervading the script is in evidence when ""friend"" Purdy (Richard Hale) angrily ""declare[s] to all that nothing will move me to violence NOTHING!""The family's ""test of values"" begins when raiders; ""Morgan's men, the toughest troops in the Confederacy"" storm the Birdwell farm. The elder of the Birdwell children Josh (Anthony Perkins) has earlier departed to join the ambush of Confederate cavalry at the river, ""because he has to fight as long as others do.""When Josh's horse returns without him, Jess is spurred to action; musket in hand and despite the vociferous protests of his wife Eliza (Dorothy McGuire) he goes looking for Josh. When his young son, Little Jess (Richard Eyer) exhorts his father to ""Kill a Johnny Reb. for me, Pa,"" Jess gently admonishes him ""Son, never talk that way about a man's life"".The only other man on the farm, the runaway slave, Enoch (Joel Fluellen) joins Josh at the ambush, but with conflicted feelings. Enoch is loath to transgress Quaker sentiments on violence and the sanctity of human life; indeed, the Birdwell's granted him refuge on the strength of those very values. Enoch's explanation is poignant, ""I hate to cross you like this Mr. Birdwell. Don't seem grateful. But you see sir; a runaway slave like me wouldn't stand a chance with some of those men. So if I'm goin' down, I'm goin' down fightin'!""Josh and Enoch premeditated their decision, but Jess and Eliza responded to immediate circumstance. Jess finds his friend Sam Jordan (Robert Middleton) lying mortally wounded by a Rebel bushwhacker (Richard Garland). He stops to render assistance and he too, is shot. Jess is merely grazed and momentarily rendered unconscious, but recovers as the Bushwhacker reloads. They struggle, but Jess disarms him and points the rifle at his stomach. The man's natural terror turns to bewilderment when Jess tells him to ""Git, I'll not harm thee."" Jess ""wavers not in his convictions,"" for what better excuse killing than revenge?Eliza, for her part ""wavers"" by attacking Confederate soldier Buster, (Don Kennedy)with a broom to save Samantha from the dinner plate. As Eliza screams at the soldier, ""Samantha's a pet [goose]...she's a pure pet!"" she almost simultaneously covers her face in shame; mortified that she has raised her hand in anger.The hapless Buster retrieves his hat from a water barrel, politely reflecting, ""Sure wish I'd known that sooner, Ma'am... much obliged.""Friendly Persuasion is a charming mix of drama, pathos and humor. Much of the humor revolves about the horse racing sub-plot between the good friends, Sam and Jess. Sam has the much faster animal, until Jess finds the mare ""Lady"" owned by The Widow Hudspeth (Marjorie Main, doing her Ma Kettle specialty). The widow has three daughters agressively anxious to marry, but their plans are continually thwarted by Lady's ""racing notions"". Whenever the women are out in their buggy hoping to meet suitors driving on the road, Lady takes off, refusing to let any other horse catch up with her. Jess and the widow see a mutual advantage in trading horses.The Production Code was still in force in 1956 and a happy melodramatic ending is obligatory and avoidance of sexual violence essential. Mattie (Phyllis Love) the Birdwell's teenage daughter is the most problematic character in the film. She simply watches on in perfect safety as ""the toughest troops in the Confederacy"" feast on her mother's cooking. Mattie also watches her family drive off to the Meeting House, until 'Gard' Jordan (Mark Richman),her love interest drives up ~ will she compromise her Quaker upbringing by going to Gard's church? The audience is given a fade out - not an answer.Just a parting comment on a fairly common practice in 1950s Hollywood movies ~ the ""audience inside joke""; sometimes this was an allusion to an actor's previous films. In the case of ""the Coop"" in Friendly Persuasion it was that flower. In ""Morocco"" (1930) Gary Cooper, as the lady-killer L&eacute;gionnaire Tom Brown, places behind his ear, the flower tossed to him  by nightclub singer/camp follower Amy Jolly (Marlene Dietrich). She also slips him her apartment key and Cooper later wears the flower ""when he goes up to see her"".In Friendly Persuasion, Sam Jordan playfully puts the flower Eliza has left in the barn behind Jess's ear.",5,The Way (we might like to wish)  We Were,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,5304,"['Friendly', 'Persuasion', '1956', 'favorite', '1950s', 'movie', 'always', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', '1971',

450137,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305128324,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 4]","Oscar thoroughly enjoyed `Friendly Persuasion'.  They nominated it for six Oscars, including Best Picture, and while it walked away empty handed, it is still considered one of the best films of the year.  While I generally like William Wyler, and was heavily intrigued by the concept of the film, I have to say that this one just failed to strike anything in me.The film tells the story of a Quaker family living in rural Indiana in 1862.  With war looming overhead, the family, and the Quaker community as a whole, is feeling pressure to break away from their religious binds and pick up arms in defense of their land.  The focus of the film is on the Birdwell family.  Eliza Birdwell is a minister in her church and struggles to keep her family in line with their beliefs.  Her husband Jess is somewhat careless and flutters back and forth with his own faith while their daughter Mattie is trying to keep her love interest at bay and their son Josh is contemplating joining the war front.The film's first half of the film feels unfocused.  There are a hodgepodge of sequences that really don't feel that uniform or that cohesive and don't establish much at all.  The fair scene I guess shows that Eliza is the only family member strong in the faith, but that itself kind of derails the whole film itself.  I guess my biggest issue is that I never once felt like this film captured the struggle, mostly because no one in the family outside of Eliza did much struggling.  Jess is portrayed as a man who is just along for the ride and really doesn't have much conviction to do what is right (according to his supposed beliefs) except so as not to upset his wife.  Josh struggles, and that is seen in the later part of the film, but it is a little too late.  Mattie gives in rather easily, and little Jess acts as if he was never even brought up in the Quaker faith.Perkins is very good here, but McGuire is the film's true star and really the only reason to see the film.  She has a quiet burn that allows the audience to BELIEVE her plight.The whole Hudspeth scene was ridiculous and comical in a way that hurt the seriousness of the film, and the overall composition of the film felt lazy, uninspired and unfocused.  I wanted this to be better, but it was a serious mix of complete bore, unrealistic character development and unintelligent writing.Oh, and Phyllis Love's portrayal of Mattie Birdwell is an utter travesty.",2,A not too friendly review of a film most people here like...,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,2422,"['Oscar', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Friendly', 'Persuasion', 'nominated', 'six', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'walked', 'away', 'empty', 'handed', 'still', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'generally', 'William', 'Wyler', 'was', 'heavily', 'intrigued', 'concept', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'just', 'failed', 'strike', 'anything', 'me.The', 'film', 'story', 'Quaker', 'family', 'living', 'rural', 'Indiana', '1862', 'war', 'looming', 'overhead', 'family', 'Quaker', 'community', 'whole', 'feeling', 'pressure', 'break', 'away', 'religious', 'binds', 'pick', 'up', 'arms', 'defense', 'land', 'focus', 'film', 'Birdwell', 'family', 'Eliza', 'Birdwell', 'minister', 'church', 'keep', 'family', 'line', 'beliefs', 'husband', 'Jess', 'somewhat', 'careless', 'flutters', 'back', 'forth', 'own', 'faith', 'daughter', 'Mattie', 'trying', 'keep', 'love', 'interest', 'bay', 'son', 'Josh', 'contemplating', 'joining', 'war', 'front.The', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'feels', 'unfocused', 'are', 'hodgepodge', 'sequences', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'uniform', 'cohesive', 'do', ""n't"", 'establish', 'much', 'fair', 'scene', 'guess', 'shows', 'Eliza', 'only', 'family', 'member', 'strong', 'faith', 'kind', 'derails', 'whole', 'film', 'guess', 'biggest', 'issue', 'never', 'once', 'felt', 'film', 'captured', 'struggle', 'mostly', 'one', 'family', 'Eliza', 'did', 'much', 'struggling', 'Jess', 'portrayed', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'conviction', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'according', 'supposed', 'beliefs', 'except', 'so', 'not', 'upset', 'wife', 'Josh', 'seen', 'later', 'part', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'Mattie', 'rather', 'easily', 'little', 'Jess', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'brought', 'up', 'Quaker', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'McGuire', 'film', 'true', 'star', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'quiet', 'burn', 'audience', 'BELIEVE', 'plight.The', 'whole', 'Hudspeth', 'scene', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'comical', 'way', 'hurt', 'seriousness', 'film', 'overall', 'composition', 'film', 'felt', 'lazy', 'uninspired', 'unfocused', 'wanted', 'be', 'better', 'was', 'serious', 'mix', 'complete', 'bore', 'unrealistic', 'character', 'development', 'unintelligent', 'writing.Oh', 'Phyllis', 'Love', 'portrayal', 'Mattie', 'Birdwell', 'utter', 'travesty']",N/A

The messages are that you have to do as your conscience tells you, and that self-defense is not the same as murder.

At the time, Anthony Perkins was a very big star adored by millions of young teenage girls like me. He had just appeared in TALL STORY with Jane Fonda and had not yet been turned into  Norman Bates in Hitchcock's PSYCHO.I saw FRIENDLY PERSUASION about five times that year (1956 --admittance to pictures was a dime back then) and was absolutely smitten. Recently, I bought the DVD version of FRIENDLY PERSUASION and rewatched the film. I wondered if I would like it as much after all these years.  The answer is yes--only now I'm taking another look at Gary Cooper. At last I can understand better what mama saw in him.FRIENDLY PERSUASION is not an antiwar film. It was released long before the antiwar movement built against Vietnam. FRIENDLY PERSUASION could actually be construed as a pro-war film made in the glowing period of the fifties when the U.S. still basked in the victories of WWII. After all, when those bad Confederates threaten Mrs. Birdwell's pet goose, all hell breaks loose. And forget Jess Birdwell, we girls all developed crushes on Mattie's Methodist soldier boyfriend. Boy he looked great in that Blue Union uniform.During the Civil War, Friends (the Birdwells are Quaker) lived in southern Indiana at the crossroads where the two armed forces met. Interestingly, the Quakers were the heart of the Underground Railroad and instrumental, though indirectly, in bringing on the Civil War--which may or may not have been fought over slavery.As they sow, so shall they reap.  The Friends are not the victims of disciplined soldiers, they are the victims of hooligans and cutthroats--Southern Bushwackers.  A less sanguine and more violent tale of life where Union and Rebel lines were not clearly drawn and Jayhawkers and Bushwhackers constantly raided was told a year or two in Ang Lee's overlooked film RIDE WITH THE DEVIL. I recommend both of these films.And a little aside--Jessmyn West who wrote the novel FRIENDLY PERSUASION on which the film is based was Richard Nixon's cousin.

450175,A276M3NSIY9B82,6305128324,Harry Brewer,"[5, 5]","ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! This is one of Hollywood's greatest films that has a cast that's superior. Friendly Persuasion isn't a western though it has some of that. The story centers on a Quaker family in southern Indiana at the outbreak of the American Civil War. It's a drama but has many comedic moments throughout.Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) is the center of the story. The laconic Cooper is perfect casting. Though Jess is a Quaker he isn't completely committed to the idea of it. He's practical & realizes that, at times, turning the other cheek doesn't always solve the problem. His wife, Eliza (Dorothy Maguire), is committed to the ways of the Quaker. She's even one of their ministers. Anytime Jess & the family begin to stray she's there to put them back on the narrow path. In a day when the female role in most movies wasn't pivotal, Friendly Persuasion was different. The female lead of Eliza was a crucial element in the film. It was probably Maguire's best role, as it would have been for any actress of that era.Josh (Anthony Perkins) is the oldest of the Birdwell children. He's the most affected by the war. He gets an opportunity to join in the fighting & is almost killed. The film's statement on war is timeless & should remind us how it affects everyone, even those not directly involved. Mattie (Phyllis Love) is the second oldest child. She's at the age where boys are becoming very interesting. Little Jess (Richard Eyer) is the youngest & steals some of the scenes that he's in. His scenes with the family pet goose are hilarious.Some of the best scenes involve Jess racing his buggy horse against his neighbor, Sam Jordan (Robert Middleton), every going-to-meeting day. Jess loses every time time but he isn't deterred. In a chance meeting with another family Jess meets Widow Hudspeth (Marjorie Main) & her three man hungry daughters. Josh has gone along & he's constantly harassed by the three daughters. But this encounter leads Jess into trading horses with the Widow Hudspeth. She needs a plow horse which Jess has that isn't a good buggy racer. The Widow has a horse that looks like a nag but is one heck of a buggy racer. Everyone thinks Jess has been taken. But, finally, Jess wins a buggy race against his neighbor.There's a scene where the family goes to a fair & we see how protected an existence they live. Jess, ever the practical one, is the one that extricates the family out of the events here. If you look closely in the scene where Jess is doing the target shooting you will see a young Robert Fuller in Union uniform near Cooper. He has no lines & the role is uncredited but he's there.Friendly Persuasion was directed by the great William Wyler. It was nominated for six Academy Awards but didn't win any. That's a shame for it was a deserving film. Those nominations were Best Director (Wyler), Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Perkins) Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Song & Best Sound.Some may see this movie as old fashioned but it presents values that we all should have. It addresses questions that plague us in a time of war. Most of all, it presents us with choices that must be made during a time of great duress. Would our beliefs & values stand up when we're presented the choice of compromising some of them? Friendly Persuasion is a film that should be seen by everyone.",5,Friendly Persuasion,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,3334,"['ESSENTIAL', 'MOVIE', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'films', 'cast', 'superior', 'Friendly', 'Persuasion', ""n't"", 'western', 'story', 'centers', 'Quaker', 'family', 'southern', 'Indiana', 'outbreak', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'drama', 'many', 'comedic', 'moments', 'throughout.Jess', 'Birdwell', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'center', 'story', 'laconic', 'Cooper', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Jess', 'Quaker', ""n't"", 'completely', 'committed', 'idea', 'practical', 'times', 'turning', 'other', 'cheek', ""n't"", 'always', 'solve', 'problem', 'wife', 'Eliza', 'Dorothy', 'Maguire', 'committed', 'ways', 'Quaker', 'even', 'one', 'ministers', 'Anytime', 'Jess', 'family', 'begin', 'stray', 'there', 'put', 'back', 'narrow', 'path', 'day', 'when', 'female', 'role', 'most', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'pivotal', 'Friendly', 'Persuasion', 'was', 'different', 'female', 'lead', 'Eliza', 'was', 'crucial', 'element', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'Maguire', 'best', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'actress', 'era.Josh', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'oldest', 'Birdwell', 'children', 'most', 'affected', 'war', 'opportunity', 'join', 'fighting', 'almost', 'killed', 'film', 'statement', 'war', 'timeless', 'should', 'remind', 'how', 'everyone', 'even', 'not', 'directly', 'involved', 'Mattie', 'Phyllis', 'Love', 'second', 'oldest', 'child', 'age', 'where', 'boys', 'are', 'becoming', 'very', 'interesting', 'Little', 'Jess', 'Richard', 'Eyer', 'youngest', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'family', 'pet', 'goose', 'are', 'hilarious.Some', 'best', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Jess', 'racing', 'buggy', 'horse', 'neighbor', 'Sam', 'Jordan', 'Robert', 'Middleton', 'going-to-meeting', 'day', 'Jess', 'time', 'time', ""n't"", 'deterred', 'chance', 'meeting', 'family', 'Jess', 'Widow', 'Hudspeth', 'Marjorie', 'Main', 'three', 'man', 'hungry', 'daughters', 'Josh', 'gone', 'along', 'constantly', 'harassed', 'three', 'daughters', 'encounter', 'Jess', 'trading', 'horses', 'Widow', 'Hudspeth', 'plow', 'horse', 'Jess', ""n't"", 'good', 'buggy', 'racer', 'Widow', 'horse', 'nag', 'one', 'heck', 'buggy', 'racer', 'Everyone', 'Jess', 'been', 'taken', 'finally', 'Jess', 'buggy', 'race', 'scene', 'where', 'family', 'fair', 'see', 'how', 'protected', 'existence', 'live', 'Jess', 'ever', 'practical', 'one', 'one', 'family', 'events', 'here', 'look', 'closely', 'scene', 'where', 'Jess', 'doing', 'target', 'shooting', 'will', 'see', 'young', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'Union', 'uniform', 'Cooper', 'lines', 'role', 'uncredited', 'there.Friendly', 'Persuasion', 'was', 'directed', 'great', 'William', 'Wyler', 'was', 'nominated', 'six', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'shame', 'was', 'deserving', 'film', 'nominations', 'were', 'Best', 'Director', 'Wyler', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Song', 'Best', 'Sound.Some', 'may', 'see', 'movie', 'old', 'fashioned', 'values', 'should', 'have', 'questions', 'plague', 'time', 'war', 'Most', 'choices', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'time', 'great', 'duress', 'Would', 'beliefs', 'values', 'stand', 'up', 'when', ""'re"", 'presented', 'choice', 'compromising', 'Friendly', 'Persuasion', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone']",N/A

The ultimate test to their  traditions arises when the need to defend their homestead from Confederate  raiders forces some difficult personal decisions, especially for their son,  well played by a young Anthony Perkins.  In a violent world, it's very  difficult to avoid conflict and violence, a message we understand even more  clearly today.

But as a member of Northwest Yearly Meeting of Friends, I enjoyed it. It is fairly well acted, and full of humor. It also is probably the best one can expect from Hollywood as far as accuracy.The humor itself is very revealing, often circling around the tendency now, and especially during the Civil War, for Friends to lapse into legalism- such as in issues of dancing, gambling, singing, and racing- in their attempt to truly follow the Spirit and the Word. The movie also accurately represents the wide range of views that Friends had in response to taking up arms in the Civil War (and again in the World Wars), with some choosing to fight and some to nonviolently resist. It brings up the interesting questions of how to respond to one's son who chooses to kill another human, when one wants to honor the child's ability to listen to God.There are other glimmers of philosophy: the difference between militancy and militarism, as displayed by one strong-feeling pacifist Quaker at the beginning; some wonderful nonviolent action practiced by Gary Cooper and his wife upon each other. She doesn't want an organ in the house, so sleeps in the barn until he removes it. He responds by putting the organ in the house, and then going to sleep in the barn along side her, coming along with her suffering. The end result is compromise, because of the love shown in strong conviction.I would have liked to see stronger convictions displayed by the Quakers represented. It does seem that too many of them choose the side of violence and darkness, or do not stick with their convictions. But at least one holds out.

Another thought was on the casting as performances from Dorothy McGuire and a young Anthony Perkins round off a superb bit of casting.

This movie is funny, charming, quaint, yet under Gary Cooper's Quaker character moves some real struggles and strife, with his wife, his religion, and killing another man.

It shows just how tough it was for those who lived during the Civil War period, especially for those, like the Quakers, who did not believe in war or violence of any kind. But, on the other hand, it has the honesty in portraying all people - even Quakers - as humans with human feelings, whether it be love, anger, competition, and even hypocrisy (in a Quaker's eyes). Not only does it show, fairly accurately, Quaker life of the mid-19th century, but life in general during that time in history. The fair scene seemed to pop right out of a history book with all the glorious sights and sounds that go with it. And speaking of sounds, I admire the producer's decision not to over do the background music in certain scenes. There are moments of complete silence during a number of parts, which gives the viewer quite a strong feeling of how ""quiet"" life was during that pre-electrical age.The acting is as good as it gets, especially Gary Cooper. He plays his role perfectly (as was usual for him) and shows himself truly to be quite the comedian. And Dorothy McGuire is simply superb as his wife. In fact, Ms. McGuire almost steals the show!It's unfortunate that this movie isn't as popular as one would think. I frequently get the questioning look from folks when speaking of this flick. But for those of us who have seen and love it, it is a favorite.Another reviewer mentioned that Friendly Persuasion is slow moving. It is, but in a very good way. It's not 'IN YOUR FACE' like so many of the current films. It requires one to watch and listen and enjoy - it doesn't need loud music, cussing, or nudity to grab your attention.

Starring Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire as Jess & Eliza Birdwell, Quakers living in Southern Indiana during the Civil War. Pacifists according to their Quaker beliefs, they have avoided participating in the Civil War but now the war is infringing on their homes and they must decide whether or not to defend themselves. The tension among the family heightens when their son (played by Anthony Perkins in the role that would make him a star) decides he must take up arms to defend their community. While the film is about a serious, philosophical subject, it is filled with humor and romance. This film is the definition of FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT. The music is great and the characters are portrayed as very human, not too harshly or too lightly. Gary Cooper is great as the straight-laced Quaker father who has a streak of 'worldliness' that keeps coming out-especially on the way to the meeting house (church) when a fellow neighbor Methodist causes a case of 'road rage' between their horse and buggies. Dorothy McGuire is the mother who is also the minister of their Quaker meeting house and takes pacifism as well as straight living very seriously. You almost believe she's as good as she appears until one of the Confederate soldiers attempts to take her pet goose. A long time classic you will be entertained and challenged to think watching this film.

My parents always took me to see Gary Cooper films because he was a fine actor and he always gave a beautiful performance and as with ""High Noon"" we have the same kind of performance here.  A man being pulled in many directions by his faith, his wife, his son, his friends, his country and having to make his way through it while trying to satifisfy the needs of all involved and to follow his own conscience.  It's a beautifully photographed film and all of the performances are convincing and evocative of people caught up in a terrible national crisis and trying to decide the best and right way to respond to it.  As an adult watching the film, I think of the allusion to the Bible -- the rural setting is peaceful and abundant -- the Garden of Eden -- with little intrusion from the outside world and then ""the serpent"" enters in the form of the Civil War -- tempting a young man to put aside his Quaker upbringing that emphasizes non-resistance and non-violence -- and yet -- we know that at the heart of the war was the ugly beast of slavery -- and the war was being fought to end that abominable practice in the United States. Some writers today want to deny that the war was fought for that reason -- yes, it was economics -- but it was an economic system in the South driven by slave-holders whose economy was built on the owning and labor of other human beings.  So the war enters the picture as the serpent entered the Garden of Eden and the Quaker family and their fellow Quakers are faced with a dilemma -- resist -- fight to protect themselves and at the same time protect the union and end the slave trade or refuse to fight and attempt to use reason and the example of compromise and non-resistance to resolve the issue.I loved the film in 1956 and I love it today because it is a timeless classic it entertains and at the same time it makes you think and examine your own conscience.",5,Timeless classic film,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1988,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'release', 'theatres', 'was', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'parents', 'always', 'took', 'see', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'films', 'was', 'fine', 'actor', 'always', 'gave', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'High', 'Noon', 'have', 'same', 'kind', 'performance', 'here', 'man', 'being', 'pulled', 'many', 'directions', 'faith', 'wife', 'son', 'friends', 'country', 'having', 'make', 'way', 'trying', 'satifisfy', 'needs', 'involved', 'follow', 'own', 'conscience', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'convincing', 'evocative', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'terrible', 'national', 'crisis', 'trying', 'decide', 'best', 'right', 'way', 'respond', 'adult', 'watching', 'film', 'think', 'allusion', 'Bible', 'rural', 'setting', 'peaceful', 'abundant', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'little', 'intrusion', 'outside', 'world', 'then', 'serpent', 'enters', 'form', 'Civil', 'War', 'tempting', 'young', 'man', 'put', 'aside', 'Quaker', 'upbringing', 'non-resistance', 'non-violence', 'yet', 'know', 'heart', 'war', 'was', 'ugly', 'beast', 'slavery', 'war', 'was', 'being', 'fought', 'end', 'abominable', 'practice', 'United', 'States', 'writers', 'today', 'want', 'deny', 'war', 'was', 'fought', 'reason', 'yes', 'was', 'economics', 'was', 'economic', 'system', 'South', 'driven', 'slave-holders', 'economy', 'was', 'built', 'owning', 'labor', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'war', 'picture', 'serpent', 'entered', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'Quaker', 'family', 'fellow', 'Quakers', 'are', 'faced', 'dilemma', 'resist', 'fight', 'protect', 'same', 'time', 'protect', 'union', 'end', 'slave', 'trade', 'refuse', 'fight', 'attempt', 'use', 'reason', 'example', 'compromise', 'non-resistance', 'resolve', 'issue.I', 'loved', 'film', '1956', 'love', 'today', 'timeless', 'classic', 'same', 'time', 'think', 'examine', 'own', 'conscience']",N/A

Cooper is the head of a Quaker family, an ideal role for him, a bit like his earlier portrayal of Sgt. York.  Dorothy McGuire (A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Old Yeller) is perfect as his wife.  The most excitement this family sees is an occasional horse race with a neighbor (Robert Middleton) on their way to church.

Johnson,"[5, 5]","I saw this movie when it came out in 1956 and went to see it several times, much to the annoyance of the lady who was taking care of me (who thought one viewing was plenty.) I was absolutely enchanted by it, and I was eight years old at the time, but it had a tremendous impact on me from start to finish. All of the performances are fabulous, and I still marvel at Tony Perkins going from this good Quaker son role to Norman Bates! The music was, and is, haunting; both the melody and the words in the title tune and the melody at the County fair when Maddie is dancing (forbidden for Quakers!) with the dashing Gard Jordan. I loved the byplay between little Jess and Samantha the goose; it is hilarious. The relationship between Jess and Eliza is glorious; they have deep love and respect for each other, with Jess gently and lovingly teasing her from time to time. On Sundays there are very competitive races between Jess and Sam Jordan (also forbidden for Quakers) and the constant losses rankles Jess enough to swap his horse for a faster one much to the dismay of Eliza. It is a fascintaing view into another world in another time; when the Civil War intrudes on this idyll, it has a devastating impact on the entire family and changes Josh forever.There is a wonderful scene between Jess and a rebel soldier which brings a lump to my throat thinking about it now, so many decades later.One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the one where Mattie is talking to little Jess about her love for Gard, and describes his eyes in loving detail, and Gard overhears which mortifies Maddie who then flees to her room in high dudgeon. She does open her window though, to ensure Gard knows how she feels. When she hears he came to say goodbye on his way to the front she runs after him; he cannot hear her at first, then she breaks down in tears and collapses in the road; fortunately he turns and sees her and gallops back and she declares her love for him for the first time in her fear of possibly never seeing him again.The family holds together despite the absence of Jess and Josh, when the rebel soldiers swarm the farm and take anything they can carry or eat. All is OK until one of the soldiers makes the mistake of trying to catch and eat Samantha the goose! Eliza forgets all her Quaker allegiance and attacks the shocked soldier with a broom screaming at him; ""She's a PET! Samantha's a pure PET!"" The soldier relinquishes his hold on the goose who honks indignantly and flaps away and Eliza throws the broom down in a fit of remorse.One of the finest scenes is during the encounter with the rebel soldiers and Tony Perkins has to face why he is there despite his Quaker upbringing, and how he makes his choice.This is a fabulous movie with wonderful acting and storyline and moments ranging from hilarious to somber to tragic and fascinating and is worth more than one viewing and of course, is entirely family friendly.",5,ENCHANTING IN THE MOST LITERAL SENSE OF THE WORD,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,2931,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1956', 'went', 'see', 'several', 'times', 'much', 'annoyance', 'lady', 'who', 'was', 'taking', 'care', 'who', 'thought', 'one', 'viewing', 'was', 'plenty', 'was', 'absolutely', 'enchanted', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'had', 'tremendous', 'impact', 'start', 'finish', 'performances', 'are', 'fabulous', 'still', 'marvel', 'Tony', 'Perkins', 'going', 'good', 'Quaker', 'son', 'role', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'music', 'was', 'haunting', 'melody', 'words', 'title', 'tune', 'melody', 'County', 'fair', 'when', 'Maddie', 'dancing', 'forbidden', 'Quakers', 'dashing', 'Gard', 'Jordan', 'loved', 'byplay', 'little', 'Jess', 'Samantha', 'goose', 'hilarious', 'relationship', 'Jess', 'Eliza', 'glorious', 'have', 'deep', 'love', 'respect', 'other', 'Jess', 'gently', 'lovingly', 'teasing', 'time', 'time', 'Sundays', 'are', 'very', 'competitive', 'races', 'Jess', 'Sam', 'Jordan', 'also', 'forbidden', 'Quakers', 'constant', 'losses', 'Jess', 'enough', 'swap', 'horse', 'faster', 'one', 'much', 'dismay', 'Eliza', 'fascintaing', 'view', 'world', 'time', 'when', 'Civil', 'War', 'idyll', 'devastating', 'impact', 'entire', 'family', 'changes', 'Josh', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'Jess', 'rebel', 'soldier', 'lump', 'throat', 'thinking', 'now', 'so', 'many', 'decades', 'later.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'one', 'where', 'Mattie', 'talking', 'little', 'Jess', 'love', 'Gard', 'eyes', 'loving', 'detail', 'Gard', 'overhears', 'mortifies', 'Maddie', 'who', 'then', 'room', 'high', 'dudgeon', 'open', 'window', 'ensure', 'Gard', 'how', 'When', 'came', 'say', 'goodbye', 'way', 'front', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'first', 'then', 'down', 'tears', 'collapses', 'road', 'fortunately', 'gallops', 'back', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'fear', 'possibly', 'never', 'seeing', 'again.The', 'family', 'together', 'absence', 'Jess', 'Josh', 'when', 'rebel', 'soldiers', 'swarm', 'farm', 'take', 'anything', 'can', 'carry', 'eat', 'OK', 'one', 'soldiers', 'mistake', 'trying', 'catch', 'eat', 'Samantha', 'goose', 'Eliza', 'Quaker', 'allegiance', 'shocked', 'soldier', 'broom', 'screaming', 'PET', 'Samantha', 'pure', 'PET', 'soldier', 'hold', 'goose', 'who', 'indignantly', 'flaps', 'away', 'Eliza', 'broom', 'down', 'fit', 'remorse.One', 'finest', 'scenes', 'encounter', 'rebel', 'soldiers', 'Tony', 'Perkins', 'face', 'why', 'there', 'Quaker', 'upbringing', 'how', 'choice.This', 'fabulous', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'storyline', 'moments', 'ranging', 'hilarious', 'somber', 'tragic', 'fascinating', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'course', 'entirely', 'family', 'friendly']",N/A

Cooper's performance like that of his co star Dorothy McGuire is of the highest order. Friendly Persuasion asks the question, what do people do when their beliefs are threatened by events?. In this case what are the Quakers of southern Indiania to do when their non violent beliefs are threatened by southern raiders during the American Civil War?What this film makes clear is that there is no single answer. McGuire as a Quaker Elder tells a Union recruiting officerthat Quakers are opposed to slavery, but that they would not kill one man to free another. She also admits that some Quakers have gone off to fight.Later as the raiders get closer Anthony Perkins as Cooper's son tells his father he is prepaired to die fighting the raiders. Cooper reminds him that he will not be asked to die but to kill.When he still insists on going off to fight McGuire begs Cooper to stop him. It is clear that this not because she is a Quaker but because he is her son and she fears for his life. Cooper tells her that each person must decide these things for themselves and answer to their own beliefs.When a fellow Quaker urges Cooper to 'pick up the rifle', his Methodist friend ( Robert Middleton ) tells him that he will fight for the both of them.Add a love interest and some comic scenes and you have a film well worth two hours of anyones time.

It's often labelled sentimental and syrupy and attacked for, among other things, its misplaced thees and thous, Pat Boone's apparently mawkish rendition of it's title song and the supposedly inexcusable violence of its otherwise upstanding Quaker family members.The film recounts an episode in the lives of a hard working farmer Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) and his stridently God fearing wife, Eliza, (Dorothy McGuire) trying to bring up their family in the early years of the American Civil War.  The fact that they are Quakers, and at the same time still prey to the `heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to' adds comedic value as we are gradually introduced to each family member, including Samantha, a cantankerous goose who is a seemingly willing participant in an on-going feud with the family's youngest son, the mischievous Little Jess.In Shenandoah, James Stewart's Will Anderson tries to disregard the bloodbath occurring all around him until it's rudely brought to his notice by the abduction of his youngest son.  Similarly, faced with the same circumstances, Jess and Eliza Birdwell studiously ignore the sound of the guns of the approaching confederate army until their eldest boy, Josh, whose moral turmoil is depicted to perfection by a tortured Anthony Perkins, defies his mother's admonition and heads off to fight for what he believes is right at the risk of simultaneously destroying any semblance of adherence to the ideals that have formed the basis of that belief.Both Cooper and McGuire are perfect and it's almost impossible, now, to imagine anyone else playing their roles: it would be a hard and cynical person not moved by their plight as they struggle to come to terms with a battle on two fronts: the reality of a civil war and the unprecedented carnage we now know it produced and the moral and emotional conflict evoked by a son leaving home to play a part in that war. The added bonus of that lushly romantic but often derided Dimitri Tiomkin score simply adds to the pleasure the film induces, at least, in this viewer.But should we be embarrassed by our natural human reactions to sentiment, warmth and those films, such as this, that unashamedly tug at our heartstrings?  In an age in which it feels all too easy to eschew those quaint old-fashioned values a dose of saccharine every now and again acts as a very welcome counterpoint.",5,Slushy and sentimental - but wonderfully so!,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,2562,"['Covering', 'similar', 'ground', 'Andrew', 'McLaglen', 'Shenandoah', '1965', 'almost', 'decade', 'before', 'gentle', 'funny', 'whimsical', 'movie', 'fair', 'share', 'critics', 'often', 'labelled', 'sentimental', 'syrupy', 'attacked', 'other', 'things', 'misplaced', 'thees', 'thous', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'apparently', 'mawkish', 'rendition', 'title', 'song', 'supposedly', 'inexcusable', 'violence', 'otherwise', 'upstanding', 'Quaker', 'family', 'members.The', 'film', 'recounts', 'episode', 'lives', 'hard', 'working', 'farmer', 'Jess', 'Birdwell', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'stridently', 'God', 'fearing', 'wife', 'Eliza', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'trying', 'bring', 'up', 'family', 'early', 'years', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'fact', 'are', 'Quakers', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'heart-ache', 'thousand', 'natural', 'shocks', 'flesh', 'heir', 'comedic', 'value', 'are', 'gradually', 'introduced', 'family', 'member', 'including', 'Samantha', 'cantankerous', 'goose', 'who', 'seemingly', 'willing', 'participant', 'on-going', 'feud', 'family', 'youngest', 'son', 'mischievous', 'Little', 'Jess.In', 'Shenandoah', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Will', 'Anderson', 'disregard', 'bloodbath', 'occurring', 'rudely', 'brought', 'notice', 'abduction', 'youngest', 'son', 'Similarly', 'faced', 'same', 'circumstances', 'Jess', 'Eliza', 'Birdwell', 'studiously', 'ignore', 'sound', 'guns', 'approaching', 'confederate', 'army', 'eldest', 'boy', 'Josh', 'moral', 'turmoil', 'depicted', 'perfection', 'tortured', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'mother', 'admonition', 'heads', 'fight', 'what', 'right', 'risk', 'simultaneously', 'destroying', 'semblance', 'adherence', 'ideals', 'have', 'formed', 'basis', 'Cooper', 'McGuire', 'are', 'perfect', 'almost', 'impossible', 'now', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'roles', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'cynical', 'person', 'not', 'moved', 'plight', 'struggle', 'come', 'terms', 'battle', 'two', 'fronts', 'reality', 'civil', 'war', 'unprecedented', 'carnage', 'now', 'know', 'produced', 'moral', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'evoked', 'son', 'leaving', 'home', 'play', 'part', 'war', 'added', 'bonus', 'lushly', 'romantic', 'often', 'derided', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'score', 'simply', 'pleasure', 'film', 'induces', 'least', 'viewer.But', 'should', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'natural', 'human', 'reactions', 'sentiment', 'warmth', 'films', 'such', 'unashamedly', 'heartstrings', 'age', 'too', 'easy', 'eschew', 'quaint', 'old-fashioned', 'values', 'dose', 'saccharine', 'now', 'again', 'acts', 'very', 'welcome', 'counterpoint']",N/A

450243,A1U3OBDXLUZ29Y,6305128324,"Thomas Gabriel ""Dr. Morbius""","[16, 17]","There aren't many films from any era that come close to being ""perfect"" (though that's not really the right word) in just about every way--probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over.""Friendly Persuasion"" is one of those films--in spades. Directed by William Wyler and starring Gary Cooper, Dorothy McGuire, and Tony Perkins, it is a wonderful, human story about a loving family of Quakers (also known as Friends) living in one of the Union-Confederate ""border"" states at the time of the Civil War in the 1860s.The cast, in small roles and large, is uniformly excellent, none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them. Led by beloved, legendary star Gary Cooper in a great performance as the head of the Quaker family Jess Birdwell, they are marvelous, including child actor Richard Eyer as feisty ""Little Jess"", scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with ""Samantha"", his mother Eliza Birdwell's pet goose, who more than carries her end of the feud with scene-stealing craftiness.There are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements, and a hilarious episode in which eldest son Josh  (Perkins) accompanies father Jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy, amorous daughters of one of Jess's customers (Marjorie Main). We are settled into a lovely, lively exploration of the Birdwell family's idyllic existence.Then the war intrudes.Josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to, even though it is against the teachings of his faith. His younger sister loves a young Union officer who is soon to go into battle. Rebel troops are nearing the region where they live, and no one, including the audience, quite knows what will happen.There is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young Josh gets his first taste of battle, which Perkins performs with heartbreaking realism. I recall my father, a World War II veteran, saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man's first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies.When it is all over and the Birdwells return to their quiet, hard-working, loving life as a family, the music (Dimitri Tiomkin's marvelous score) swells, the wonderful lyrics to the song ""Friendly Persuasion"" are sung sweetly by the young Pat Boone, and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine, completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times.The story has been told with integrity, honesty, humanity, gentle humor, kind restraint and, yes, love--all of these also attributes of the Birdwell family that we have come to know. That is the ""genius"" of this film. Along with a very few others, it shows us who we are, who we can be, and how we can live, all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic. And the film never, ever loses its balance.It's just a great and good movie. I've seen it almost a dozen times, and it can still move me to tears. I'm betting it could be released today, amid the ridiculously over-budgeted, badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma, and that it would clean up at the box office.The term ""family values"" has been kicked around a lot lately, and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it. Watch this truly beautiful film and you'll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words.",5,Five Stars Just Aren't Enough!,1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,3445,"['are', ""n't"", 'many', 'films', 'era', 'come', 'close', 'being', 'perfect', 'not', 'really', 'right', 'word', 'just', 'way', 'probably', 'could', 'count', 'fingers', 'have', 'left', 'over', 'Friendly', 'Persuasion', 'one', 'films', 'spades', 'Directed', 'William', 'Wyler', 'starring', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'Tony', 'Perkins', 'wonderful', 'human', 'story', 'loving', 'family', 'Quakers', 'also', 'known', 'Friends', 'living', 'one', 'Union-Confederate', 'border', 'states', 'time', 'Civil', 'War', '1860s.The', 'cast', 'small', 'roles', 'large', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'none', 'calling', 'attention', 'rather', 'becoming', 'characters', 'making', 'understand', 'Led', 'beloved', 'legendary', 'star', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'great', 'performance', 'head', 'Quaker', 'family', 'Jess', 'Birdwell', 'are', 'marvelous', 'including', 'child', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Eyer', 'feisty', 'Little', 'Jess', 'scrapping', 'big', 'sister', 'partaking', 'running', 'feud', 'Samantha', 'mother', 'Eliza', 'Birdwell', 'pet', 'goose', 'who', 'more', 'end', 'feud', 'scene-stealing', 'craftiness.There', 'are', 'incidents', 'family', 'humor', 'love', 'occasional', 'disagreements', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'eldest', 'son', 'Josh', 'Perkins', 'Jess', 'sales', 'trip', 'set', 'scrappy', 'amorous', 'daughters', 'one', 'Jess', 'customers', 'Marjorie', 'Main', 'are', 'settled', 'lovely', 'lively', 'exploration', 'Birdwell', 'family', 'idyllic', 'war', 'intrudes.Josh', 'feels', 'must', 'volunteer', 'fight', 'as', 'long', 'others', 'have', 'even', 'teachings', 'faith', 'younger', 'sister', 'young', 'Union', 'officer', 'who', 'soon', 'go', 'battle', 'Rebel', 'troops', 'are', 'nearing', 'region', 'where', 'live', 'one', 'including', 'audience', 'quite', 'what', 'will', 'happen.There', 'beautifully', 'honest', 'dramatic', 'sequence', 'young', 'Josh', 'first', 'taste', 'battle', 'performs', 'heartbreaking', 'realism', 'recall', 'father', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veteran', 'saying', 'scene', 'was', 'most', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'young', 'man', 'first', 'time', 'battle', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'movies.When', 'Birdwells', 'return', 'quiet', 'hard-working', 'loving', 'life', 'family', 'music', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'marvelous', 'score', 'wonderful', 'lyrics', 'song', 'Friendly', 'Persuasion', 'are', 'sung', 'sweetly', 'young', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'realize', 'have', 'spent', 'two', 'wonderful', 'hours', 'genuinely', 'fine', 'completely', 'human', 'characters', 'ordinary', 'life', 'challenging', 'times.The', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'integrity', 'honesty', 'humanity', 'gentle', 'humor', 'kind', 'restraint', 'yes', 'love', 'also', 'Birdwell', 'family', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'genius', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'can', 'live', 'grace', 'humility', 'almost', 'poetic', 'film', 'never', 'ever', 'balance.It', 'just', 'great', 'good', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'almost', 'dozen', 'times', 'can', 'still', 'move', 'tears', ""'m"", 'betting', 'could', 'be', 'released', 'today', 'ridiculously', 'over-budgeted', 'badly', 'executed', 'films', 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'computer', 'effects', 'star', 'charisma', 'would', 'clean', 'up', 'box', 'office.The', 'term', 'family', 'values', 'been', 'kicked', 'lot', 'lately', 'nobody', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'meant', 'Watch', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'film', ""'ll"", 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'genuine', 'meaning', 'words']",N/A
