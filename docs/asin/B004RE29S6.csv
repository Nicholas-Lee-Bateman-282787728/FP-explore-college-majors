1426776,AGZZM0UG0PPGA,B004RE29S6,"Beeshy ""AliciA""","[0, 1]","I was so excited when I heard that Tom Sturridge had a new movie out. I loved him in Pirate Radio. Sadly as stated in other reviews he was pretty much the only good thing about this movie. 3 stars for his performance, a few good side characters + the awkwardly romantic story line. *Spoilers. You know that things are going to get rough since Emma Twist(Rachel Bilson) has no idea that Will(Tom Sturridge) has been following her around like an adorable lost puppy all over the continent for years. A super adorable charasmatic puppy but still. The story could have been she finds out, freaks out then realizes she loves him as much as he loves her but there is this whole thing w/ her bofriend that felt just completely random. I guess they needed some way to get him out of the picture. So don't go in expecting a cute romcom this is way way more romantic drama. Will has the boyfriend + his horrible timing to contend w/. He choosees to tell Emma he's been following her when he follows her home because her father is dying.Yeah awful timing. Especially since things are going good until he tels her about his tag along fixtion w/ her. Since Will has this everthing is always good view of life that his brother wants to force out of him but his friends embrace his innocence + obsession and just enjoy his being there. Reality does slap him around but he still comes out the same great hearted guy. Does Emma succcumb to his magnetic personality, well I'm sure you can figure that out on our own. Give this one a look see for Tom Sturridge's performance alone. You'll fall in love w/ his character right outta the gate + root for him throughout the entire film. The only way his performance could've been better is if he got to use that oh so hot british accent. So give it a go if you have some time to kill + you like Tom Sturridge.",3,Waiting For Forever Exactly,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,1836,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'Tom', 'Sturridge', 'had', 'new', 'movie', 'loved', 'Pirate', 'Radio', 'Sadly', 'stated', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'performance', 'few', 'good', 'side', 'characters', '+', 'awkwardly', 'romantic', 'story', 'line', '*Spoilers', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'rough', 'Emma', 'Twist', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'idea', 'Will', 'Tom', 'Sturridge', 'been', 'following', 'adorable', 'lost', 'puppy', 'continent', 'years', 'super', 'adorable', 'charasmatic', 'puppy', 'still', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'out', 'out', 'then', 'as', 'much', 'whole', 'thing', 'w/', 'bofriend', 'felt', 'just', 'completely', 'random', 'guess', 'needed', 'way', 'get', 'picture', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'cute', 'romcom', 'way', 'way', 'more', 'romantic', 'drama', 'Will', 'boyfriend', 'horrible', 'timing', 'contend', 'w/', 'tell', 'Emma', 'been', 'following', 'when', 'home', 'father', 'dying.Yeah', 'awful', 'timing', 'Especially', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'good', 'tag', 'fixtion', 'Will', 'everthing', 'always', 'good', 'view', 'life', 'brother', 'force', 'friends', 'embrace', 'innocence', '+', 'obsession', 'just', 'enjoy', 'being', 'there', 'Reality', 'slap', 'around', 'still', 'out', 'same', 'great', 'hearted', 'guy', 'Does', 'Emma', 'succcumb', 'magnetic', 'personality', 'well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'own', 'Give', 'one', 'look', 'see', 'Tom', 'Sturridge', 'performance', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'w/', 'character', 'right', 'gate', '+', 'root', 'entire', 'film', 'only', 'way', 'performance', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'got', 'use', 'so', 'hot', 'british', 'accent', 'So', 'give', 'go', 'have', 'time', 'kill', '+', 'Tom', 'Sturridge']",Waiting For Forever

1426779,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004RE29S6,DVD Verdict,"[1, 5]","Judge Franck Tabouring, DVD Verdict -- ""Waiting for Forever tries really hard to come across as a heartwarming fairy tale, but as much as I hate to say this, it simply doesn't succeed. I can see how this film could have had some potential on paper during early developmental stages, but as a finished product, it's loaded with annoying flaws that make it nearly impossible to fall in love with. The movie takes quite long to introduce viewers to every character in the film. While that is certainly admirable, it doesn't necessarily move along the story we should be caring about. We're also forced to fight our way through a bunch of backstory, and while it definitely helps build the central story, it sure could have been reduced a little. By the time Will makes contact with Emma, I found myself unable to care about either one of them. I wish I could say I loved the performances in Waiting for Forever, but that wouldn't be true. While Bilson has a few solid moments giving her the opportunity to show off her acting talent, Sturridge seems to struggle with the portrayal of a crazy dude running after the girl of his dreams. Let's just say his delivery remains stiff throughout. The only one shining in every scene he's in is Richard Jenkins, who plays Emma's sarcastic dad. Then again, we're talking about an actor who pretty much always hits the right notes. I give this to director James Keach though: he sure managed to deliver on great production values. The film's shot well and looks great, and anything from locations to costumes just fits the mood. On a similar note, I must applaud 20th Century Fox for giving the film a superb Blu-ray treatment. Presented in a 1.85:1 widescreen transfer, the movie boasts a clean image quality rich in colors and sharpness. Audio tracks are balanced fairly well too, so technically speaking. Special features are nowhere to be found.""",2,"Tries to be cute, but fails miserably",1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,1886,"['Judge', 'Franck', 'Tabouring', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Waiting', 'Forever', 'tries', 'really', 'hard', 'come', 'heartwarming', 'fairy', 'tale', 'as', 'much', 'hate', 'say', 'simply', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'potential', 'paper', 'early', 'developmental', 'stages', 'finished', 'product', 'loaded', 'annoying', 'flaws', 'make', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'quite', 'long', 'introduce', 'viewers', 'character', 'film', 'certainly', 'admirable', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'move', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'caring', 'about', ""'re"", 'also', 'forced', 'fight', 'way', 'bunch', 'backstory', 'definitely', 'build', 'central', 'story', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'little', 'time', 'Will', 'contact', 'Emma', 'found', 'unable', 'care', 'one', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'loved', 'performances', 'Waiting', 'Forever', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'true', 'Bilson', 'few', 'solid', 'moments', 'giving', 'opportunity', 'show', 'off', 'acting', 'talent', 'Sturridge', 'struggle', 'portrayal', 'crazy', 'dude', 'running', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'delivery', 'stiff', 'only', 'one', 'shining', 'scene', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'Emma', 'sarcastic', 'dad', 'Then', 'again', ""'re"", 'talking', 'actor', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'always', 'right', 'notes', 'give', 'director', 'James', 'Keach', 'sure', 'managed', 'deliver', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'shot', 'well', 'great', 'anything', 'locations', 'costumes', 'just', 'mood', 'similar', 'note', 'must', 'applaud', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'giving', 'film', 'superb', 'Blu-ray', 'treatment', 'Presented', '1.85:1', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'movie', 'clean', 'image', 'quality', 'rich', 'colors', 'sharpness', 'Audio', 'tracks', 'are', 'balanced', 'fairly', 'well', 'too', 'so', 'technically', 'speaking', 'Special', 'features', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found']",Waiting For Forever

I found the story compelling and at times wasn't sure what to expect next. The main character, Will, is a dreamer, the boyfriend is pretty scary, and Will's memories of their childhood were sweet to experience with him as he remembered better times. But he lived in a bit of a fantasy world. That was well done. I thought the acting was pretty good too. You could tell a lot from their expressions without them having to say a word. I love movies like that. When the heroine found out the hero, Will, had been following her, her reaction was palpable. The look of shock, then fear, then horror, then confusion all played out in her expression, and I thought the actress did a great job showing emotion in that scene. I also loved the scene where the older brother picks Will up and they are in the cab and Will says that life isn't peachy and things don't always turn out right. His stark realization of the hard truths in life and the way their emotions play out were well done. That scene was quite powerful.

1426789,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B004RE29S6,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 3]","Waiting for Forever is a very unusual film but one reminiscent of movies made during the 1930s and early 1940s that contain an underlying and somewhat clich&eacute; theme that love lasts forever or returns in some form.  With this as the main premise of the film, main characters Emma Twist (Rachel Bilson) and Willie Donner (Tom Sturridge) had been childhood friends, become re-acquainted when both return to their hometown after leading separate lives.  Emma became an actress in Hollywood while Willie dealt with his parents' death and became a street performer somewhere along the West Coast while still attempting to find Emma.  The film appears to have a predictable storyline, however, beyond that portion of the story, complications arise.The film has dramatic and romantic overtones but also involves the intricacies of relationships.  Both Emma and Willie must confront major concerns within each of their respective families as well as friends that enter the picture.  For Willie there is much concern of his state of mind by his brother who has taken the responsibility of keeping in touch with him while he literally juggled his way through a vagabond life.  And for Emma, she along with her mother (Blythe Danner) have had to deal with her father's illness that is not completely explained and is one of the odd portions of the storyline; this part of the story appears fragmented because Emma's father (Richard Jenkins) appeared like he was getting well but by the end of the film it is questionable.  And to add to the complications, Emma's boyfriend (Matthew Davis) surprisingly shows up to forgive her for past misgivings, but his story is much more complex than realized as well as her own -- one of those whiplash moments.  But by the end of the film, the story between Emma and Willie come full circle.Waiting for Forever has moments of drama and witty irony that one usually sees in an unpredictable film.  That important aspect makes the movie very interesting and thought provoking. Although when one watches the first half hour or hour of the film, it may appear to be a typical storyline.  However, it is unpredictability between Emma and Willie and the focal point of the relationship, friendship and memories that make the film worth watching.",4,"""You will always be loved...""",1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,2271,"['Waiting', 'Forever', 'very', 'unusual', 'film', 'one', 'reminiscent', 'movies', 'made', '1930s', 'early', '1940s', 'contain', 'underlying', 'somewhat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'love', 'forever', 'returns', 'form', 'main', 'premise', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'Emma', 'Twist', 'Rachel', 'Bilson', 'Willie', 'Donner', 'Tom', 'Sturridge', 'had', 'been', 'childhood', 'friends', 'become', 're-acquainted', 'when', 'return', 'hometown', 'leading', 'separate', 'lives', 'Emma', 'became', 'actress', 'Hollywood', 'Willie', 'dealt', 'parents', 'death', 'became', 'street', 'performer', 'somewhere', 'West', 'Coast', 'still', 'attempting', 'find', 'Emma', 'film', 'have', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'however', 'portion', 'story', 'complications', 'arise.The', 'film', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'overtones', 'also', 'intricacies', 'relationships', 'Emma', 'Willie', 'must', 'confront', 'major', 'concerns', 'respective', 'families', 'as', 'well', 'friends', 'enter', 'picture', 'Willie', 'much', 'concern', 'state', 'mind', 'brother', 'who', 'taken', 'responsibility', 'keeping', 'touch', 'literally', 'juggled', 'way', 'vagabond', 'life', 'Emma', 'along', 'mother', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'have', 'had', 'deal', 'father', 'illness', 'not', 'completely', 'explained', 'one', 'odd', 'portions', 'storyline', 'part', 'story', 'fragmented', 'Emma', 'father', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'appeared', 'was', 'getting', 'well', 'end', 'film', 'questionable', 'add', 'complications', 'Emma', 'boyfriend', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'surprisingly', 'up', 'forgive', 'past', 'misgivings', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'realized', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'one', 'whiplash', 'moments', 'end', 'film', 'story', 'Emma', 'Willie', 'come', 'full', 'circle.Waiting', 'Forever', 'moments', 'drama', 'witty', 'irony', 'one', 'usually', 'unpredictable', 'film', 'important', 'aspect', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'when', 'one', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'hour', 'film', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'typical', 'storyline', 'However', 'unpredictability', 'Emma', 'Willie', 'focal', 'point', 'relationship', 'friendship', 'memories', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",Waiting For Forever

But this movie is so very charming and is so very possible.  The sad thing is that most people may think this could never happen, but I know it can.I did not know the leads in this but from the beginning I was charmed.  I watched it on the computer screen and leaned into the movie to be as close as I could be.  Tom Sturridge has my heart and Rachel Bilson turned out to be as dear in the end as he was throughout the film.I can't say more than this but buy the film at the price on Amazon.  You will find it may be a cult film.  The music is great.  I bought the soundtrack on iTunes, too.  I literally have no words but WONDERFUL for the film.The last scene, shot at the wharf in San Francisco,  is a killer scene!  You will play it over and over.
