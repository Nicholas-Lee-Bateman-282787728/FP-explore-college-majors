1456458,A118A49ORGNEUM,B005E7WLVK,D. Barber,"[0, 0]","OK, I'm an unabashed Angela Bettis fan. I simply love her amazing face and chameleon-like transformations.I've puzzled over this, and I think that the appeal of her look is that everyone knows her face from real life. Your third grade teacher, the teller at the bank, the checker at Safeway. She has a look that is just really interesting and yes, I like her.The movie Drones, filmed in New Orleans, is very quirky and I can't say I much cared for it as a film. I will say that Samm Levine is fun as the first alien, and I loved the way James Urbaniak nicely captured the character of the corporate department head.He was dead-on.But, it's Angela Bettis who made me part with my $20. I keep hoping she'll get that breakout role that puts her in the big time.One big complaint though, as several others have commented on, is that the film was released to television in a 4:3 aspect ratio, and here on DVD in a letterboxed 16:9. This is exasperating and my original thought was that it was the greed of a producer holding out for top dollar to the full image rights. But, now I think I see what may have happened. This was a small budget art film made on a shoestring budget. I recently read that 35 mm film stock is very expensive; around $25,000 per 10 minute segment. By comparison, the same image shot on 16 mm stock is around $6,000 per 10 minutes. The smaller film scale would limit the resolution of final prints. I wonder if that might have something to do with this?Lending support to this theory, is the fact that when I viewed the DVD on my disc drive, I set the image to 16:9 which does indeed fill my 1920 x 1080 monitor, but I noticed a slight pixilation which gave the movie an effect similar to a &#34;soft focus&#34;. It's not too bad, and I can live with it, but it does spoil the image quality a bit. Perhaps the producers simply could not finance full sized film stock.",5,Angela Bettis shines.,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,1887,"['OK', ""'m"", 'unabashed', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'fan', 'simply', 'love', 'amazing', 'face', 'chameleon-like', 'transformations.I', ""'ve"", 'puzzled', 'think', 'appeal', 'look', 'everyone', 'face', 'real', 'life', 'third', 'grade', 'teacher', 'teller', 'bank', 'checker', 'Safeway', 'look', 'just', 'really', 'interesting', 'yes', 'like', 'her.The', 'movie', 'Drones', 'filmed', 'New', 'Orleans', 'very', 'quirky', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'cared', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'Samm', 'Levine', 'fun', 'first', 'alien', 'loved', 'way', 'James', 'Urbaniak', 'nicely', 'captured', 'character', 'corporate', 'department', 'head.He', 'was', 'dead-on.But', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'who', 'made', 'part', '20', 'keep', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'get', 'breakout', 'role', 'big', 'time.One', 'big', 'complaint', 'though', 'several', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'television', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'here', 'DVD', 'letterboxed', '16:9', 'exasperating', 'original', 'thought', 'was', 'was', 'greed', 'producer', 'holding', 'out', 'top', 'dollar', 'full', 'image', 'rights', 'now', 'think', 'see', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'was', 'small', 'budget', 'art', 'film', 'made', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'recently', 'read', '35', 'mm', 'film', 'stock', 'very', 'expensive', '25,000', '10', 'minute', 'segment', 'comparison', 'same', 'image', 'shot', '16', 'mm', 'stock', 'around', '6,000', '10', 'minutes', 'smaller', 'film', 'scale', 'would', 'limit', 'resolution', 'final', 'prints', 'wonder', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'Lending', 'support', 'theory', 'fact', 'when', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'disc', 'drive', 'set', 'image', '16:9', 'indeed', 'fill', '1920', 'x', '1080', 'monitor', 'noticed', 'slight', 'pixilation', 'gave', 'movie', 'effect', 'similar', '34', 'soft', 'focus', '34', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'can', 'live', 'spoil', 'image', 'quality', 'bit', 'Perhaps', 'producers', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'finance', 'full', 'sized', 'film', 'stock']",N/A
1456459,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B005E7WLVK,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Once again the independent film folk have come up with an engaging and original idea and played it for all it's worth.Here's the scoop. Brian performs some vague task at a company that is involved in some vague business (insurance?) and he leads a dull life. He is urged by a buddy co-worker (Clark) to start dating another co-worker (Amy). And though things begin well enough, when he finds out she's an alien, he can't deal with it and wants to end the romance. Amy gets ticked and reports back to her superiors that  Earth and its inhabitants need to be destroyed. Well....Brian just can't let that happen.What a hoot. I had the time of my life watching this. It's goofy fun. The office is the only set with it's cubicles, break room and copier/ supply room. People rather aimlessly walk around for seemingly no real reason. No one has any sense of urgency or seems to be performing any specific task. This is a real stab at modern corporate existence. Power Point presentations are made to remind the workers that they perform a function and have little sense of personal identity. And, apparently, we have some number of alien races that have infiltrated our society for various reasons both good and bad for us. The conversations between everyone are weird. I think my handling of the news that my entire planet, me included, was going to be wiped out, would be very different from what is said on screen. But that's the charm of the movie. The message that corporate existence has made drones of us is driven home in spades.I liked Johnathan Woodward as Brian. He's a vaguely handsome everyman. Angela Bettis, as Amy, might not be everyone's idea of pretty but the camera loves her here. She's given a lot of closeups and I fell in love with her. She even walks great. Samm Levine is a real cut-up as Clark. He gets involved in these whacko conversations with Brian. This is another point in the film. Most of the conversations are odd in that they show how media, and the sense of media, has invaded our lives. How we have a difficult time acting as people and, instead, see ourselves as someone in a TV show or movie. We've become very self-aware.This had a reported $500,000.00 budget but the base level production values are such that you don't see the bones. The actors do a good job and the camera and editing don't give it the feel of a student film. Hats off to both directors on that. It's a quirky little indy film that should satisfy the cravings of those looking for something off the beaten path.",4,"""Office Space"" meets Bizarro ""Office Space""",1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2516,"['Once', 'again', 'independent', 'film', 'folk', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'engaging', 'original', 'idea', 'played', 'scoop', 'Brian', 'vague', 'task', 'company', 'involved', 'vague', 'business', 'insurance', 'dull', 'life', 'urged', 'buddy', 'co-worker', 'Clark', 'start', 'dating', 'co-worker', 'Amy', 'things', 'begin', 'well', 'enough', 'when', 'out', 'alien', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'end', 'romance', 'Amy', 'ticked', 'reports', 'back', 'superiors', 'Earth', 'inhabitants', 'need', 'be', 'destroyed', 'Well', '.Brian', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'happen.What', 'hoot', 'had', 'time', 'life', 'watching', 'goofy', 'fun', 'office', 'only', 'set', 'cubicles', 'break', 'room', 'copier/', 'supply', 'room', 'People', 'rather', 'aimlessly', 'walk', 'seemingly', 'real', 'reason', 'one', 'sense', 'urgency', 'be', 'performing', 'specific', 'task', 'real', 'stab', 'modern', 'corporate', 'existence', 'Power', 'Point', 'presentations', 'are', 'made', 'remind', 'workers', 'perform', 'function', 'have', 'little', 'sense', 'personal', 'identity', 'apparently', 'have', 'number', 'alien', 'races', 'have', 'infiltrated', 'society', 'various', 'reasons', 'good', 'bad', 'conversations', 'everyone', 'are', 'weird', 'think', 'handling', 'news', 'entire', 'planet', 'included', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'wiped', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'said', 'screen', 'charm', 'movie', 'message', 'corporate', 'existence', 'made', 'drones', 'driven', 'home', 'spades.I', 'liked', 'Johnathan', 'Woodward', 'Brian', 'vaguely', 'handsome', 'everyman', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'Amy', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'idea', 'pretty', 'camera', 'here', 'given', 'lot', 'closeups', 'fell', 'love', 'even', 'walks', 'great', 'Samm', 'Levine', 'real', 'cut-up', 'Clark', 'involved', 'whacko', 'conversations', 'Brian', 'point', 'film', 'Most', 'conversations', 'are', 'odd', 'show', 'how', 'media', 'sense', 'media', 'invaded', 'lives', 'How', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'acting', 'people', 'instead', 'see', 'someone', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'become', 'very', 'self-aware.This', 'had', 'reported', '500,000.00', 'budget', 'base', 'level', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'bones', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'camera', 'editing', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'feel', 'student', 'film', 'directors', 'quirky', 'little', 'indy', 'film', 'should', 'satisfy', 'cravings', 'looking', 'something', 'beaten', 'path']",N/A

She writes books. (She also directs. Drones is an office-place comedy she co-directed with Adam Busch (another Buffy alum). Cult television fans will also be pleased by the presence of Samm Levine and Dave (Gruber) Allen, both from Freaks & Geeks.The story is simple: Brian Dilks (Jonathon M. Woodward) is a ""humble bumblebee"" at work, just wanting to his job without any fanfare. When he discovers his best friend Clark (Samm Levine) is an alien, he decides to go outside of his comfort boundaries. He pushes his office flirtation with Amy (Angela Bettis) to the next level by asking her out. Unfortunately, their relationship could have seriously bad consequences for Earth.Drones is hilarious. It's a small movie, never leaving the confines of OmniLink. But OmniLink has enough weirdos to keep you guessing, when anyone could be an alien in disguise. I enjoyed that everyone liked Cooperman, who did his work calmly, mediated office conflicts, and was an all-around nice guy. It's nice to see someone get stuff done by being a good guy.In addition, the soundtrack by Dan Bern is terrific.
