1692754,A12YLACPTEHDJS,B00HW3LG3S,KarenFan,"[15, 18]","So, here we arrive at the series finale of Laverne & Shirley, arguably the weakest link in the sitcom's historic 8-yr run.  In summary, there really isn't much to say about this particular season.  Cindy Williams was only present for the first two episodes.  ""Window on Main Street"" is worth a few good laughs, however  the other episodes after her exodus were fairly substandard.  We see Laverne dealing with Shirley's sudden departure, and after getting fired from Bardwell's, see her accepting a job at an aeronautical facility.  We also see her sentenced to death row in a case of mistaken identity? (2 part episode).  I kid you not.  It's in this season where we discover  (sort of) why Edna left Frank, Laverne apparently now has ""ghosts"" in her apartment, we saw how Michael McKean mysteriously vanished from the final episodes for some never-explained reason, Squiggy has no real point or purpose, Rhonda-Lee tries her darndest at singing and playing a trumpet for some big-shot executive hanging out in Cowboy Bill's, Frank decides to run for city council (and of course loses), and Eddie Mekka basically realizes his career in California is on the skids and decides to move off to NYC to try his luck on Broadway instead.  That about sums it all up in a nutshell, folks.Season 8 is a perfect example of why they should have called it quits after season 7.  Once Cindy Williams made her exit, the series should have been cancelled outright and the time slot filled with re-runs.  The show had become a shadow of its former self, the writing and storylines ridiculous, and everyone looked liked they were just standing around waiting for their final paychecks so they could move on to other endeavors.  In retrospect, the show was way past its prime at this point and the lack of any new material--or characters--was the final straw.  Interestingly enough, Penny Marshall's biography, ""My Mother Was Nuts"", discusses the strange circumstances surrounding seasons 6-8, and why ABC quietly dropped the series from its lineup.  Marshall herself admits the program was a total DISASTER in its final season.  It was almost like the writers/producers simply lost their way.This show deserved so much more, and a way better grand finale, IMO.  At least we'll have our memories of what was once the most popular sitcom on prime-time TV.  Glad we now have the entire collection on DVD however, even though it took us 10yrs to finally reach the end...And that's a wrap, folks.  Laverne & Shirley rides off into the sunset of golden comedy classics. I have to admit, the restoration on most of these DVD sets has so far been very well done, however there WAS some obvious editing done here and there, so be aware there might be some missing segments or footage on certain episodes. In any case, the reproduction here is quite impressive.  Pictures are clean and crisp with minimal graininess, colors are bright and vivid.  Look for special guest stars Shecky Greene, James Belushi, Adam West, Jay Leno, Carol Kane,  Joanna Kerns, The Spinners, Louise Lasser, and the late Larry Breeding this season too.Enjoy the trip down memory lane nonetheless...*UPDATE*  I have now watched all three discs.  Again, I noticed some minor editing done here and there on certain segments(mostly pertaining to songs and music clearances), while the last two episodes: ""Councilman DeFazio"", and ""Here Today, Hair Tomorrow"", are shown out of sequence.  Why on earth the geniuses at Paramount didn't catch this faux-pas is beyond me.  Other than that, it's OK.  We now have the entire complete collection, seasons 1-8, so I guess I can't complain too much.",2,The Season That Calls It A Wrap...,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,3633,"['So', 'here', 'arrive', 'series', 'finale', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'arguably', 'weakest', 'link', 'sitcom', 'historic', '8-yr', 'run', 'summary', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'particular', 'season', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'was', 'only', 'present', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Window', 'Main', 'Street', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'however', 'other', 'episodes', 'exodus', 'were', 'fairly', 'substandard', 'see', 'Laverne', 'dealing', 'Shirley', 'sudden', 'departure', 'getting', 'fired', 'Bardwell', 'see', 'accepting', 'job', 'aeronautical', 'facility', 'also', 'see', 'sentenced', 'death', 'row', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', '2', 'part', 'episode', 'kid', 'not', 'season', 'where', 'discover', 'sort', 'why', 'Edna', 'left', 'Frank', 'Laverne', 'apparently', 'now', 'ghosts', 'apartment', 'saw', 'how', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'mysteriously', 'vanished', 'final', 'episodes', 'never-explained', 'reason', 'Squiggy', 'real', 'point', 'purpose', 'Rhonda-Lee', 'darndest', 'singing', 'playing', 'trumpet', 'big-shot', 'executive', 'hanging', 'out', 'Cowboy', 'Bill', 'Frank', 'run', 'city', 'council', 'course', 'loses', 'Eddie', 'Mekka', 'basically', 'career', 'California', 'skids', 'decides', 'move', 'off', 'NYC', 'try', 'luck', 'Broadway', 'instead', 'sums', 'up', 'nutshell', 'folks.Season', '8', 'perfect', 'example', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'called', 'season', '7', 'Once', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'made', 'exit', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cancelled', 'outright', 'time', 'slot', 'filled', 're-runs', 'show', 'had', 'become', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'writing', 'storylines', 'ridiculous', 'everyone', 'looked', 'liked', 'were', 'just', 'standing', 'around', 'waiting', 'final', 'paychecks', 'could', 'move', 'other', 'endeavors', 'retrospect', 'show', 'was', 'way', 'prime', 'point', 'lack', 'new', 'material', 'characters', 'was', 'final', 'straw', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'biography', 'Mother', 'Was', 'Nuts', 'strange', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'seasons', '6-8', 'why', 'ABC', 'quietly', 'dropped', 'series', 'lineup', 'Marshall', 'program', 'was', 'total', 'DISASTER', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'almost', 'writers/producers', 'simply', 'lost', 'way.This', 'show', 'deserved', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'way', 'better', 'grand', 'finale', 'IMO', 'least', ""'ll"", 'have', 'memories', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'most', 'popular', 'sitcom', 'prime-time', 'TV', 'now', 'have', 'entire', 'collection', 'DVD', 'however', 'even', 'took', '10yrs', 'finally', 'reach', 'end', 'wrap', 'folks', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'sunset', 'golden', 'comedy', 'classics', 'have', 'admit', 'restoration', 'most', 'DVD', 'sets', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'however', 'WAS', 'obvious', 'editing', 'done', 'here', 'there', 'so', 'be', 'aware', 'might', 'be', 'missing', 'segments', 'footage', 'certain', 'episodes', 'case', 'reproduction', 'here', 'quite', 'impressive', 'Pictures', 'are', 'clean', 'crisp', 'minimal', 'graininess', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'vivid', 'Look', 'special', 'guest', 'stars', 'Shecky', 'Greene', 'James', 'Belushi', 'Adam', 'West', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'Joanna', 'Kerns', 'Spinners', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'late', 'Larry', 'Breeding', 'season', 'too.Enjoy', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'nonetheless', '*UPDATE*', 'have', 'now', 'watched', 'three', 'discs', 'Again', 'noticed', 'minor', 'editing', 'done', 'here', 'there', 'certain', 'segments', 'mostly', 'pertaining', 'songs', 'music', 'clearances', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Councilman', 'DeFazio', 'Here', 'Today', 'Hair', 'Tomorrow', 'are', 'shown', 'sequence', 'Why', 'earth', 'geniuses', 'Paramount', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'faux-pas', 'Other', 'OK.', 'now', 'have', 'entire', 'complete', 'collection', 'seasons', '1-8', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much']",Laverne & Shirley: The Eighth and Final Season

Heater ""Ron Heater""","[23, 27]",Shirley left after the second eposide (Shirley gets married - 1st eposide to army doc (not long time love Carmine) and 2nd eposide she is pregant). Third eposide she is no longer on. I think this ended the show because it was not the same withour Shirley. They still called it Laverne & Shirley but it was only Laverne and mostly Squiggy. Lenny was not on that much either. I said in the previous season Edna was gone. I enjoyed one eposide with Vicky Lawrence playing Sgt. Plout out of the Army for pregnancy leave and to win a contest - to double her chances to win it - Laverne helps by entering too and fake to be pregnant. I think the show should have ended in season 7 with Carmine marrying Shirley and Laverne should have found some one.

This season is, &#34;peculiar&#34; to say the least.  Leads Cindy Williams and Penny Marshall were feuding, with the former feeling slighted by the Marshall clan production. Williams, then pregnant, leaves the show. This fractured the cast.  Shirley's step-mom Edna is never seen again, with a lame mid-season statement that she left Papa DiFazio. And Lenny does only a few episodes and vanishes too- though they keep shots of him in the intro and closure. This was more like Twilight Zone, as people kept disappearing! So there you are- minus three main characters. One word fits- pitiful. This ranks with the final season of Roseann. Gary Marshall should have brought in another Shirley (a different character), and maybe brought the series back to it's midwest roots in a &#34;missing season&#34; (perhaps a time when Shirley Feeney spends 15 months in Cosmotology school and sublets to another Shirley. Since Shirley was a popular name in 1960 due to Shirley Temple).
