I kept asking myself questions like: ""what happens now?"", ""what's that?"", ""what are you doing?"" And I asked the 3rd one in French & Italian. Sometime during the movie, I was like ""Ooh. That's gotta hurt."" There's barely not much dialogue. Throughout the course of this, I kept calling Robert such names like Ike or Sundance Kid. Towards the end, I thought he was sacrificing himself and I barely cried. Then it turned out to be a relief. I thought about it a lot and I watched it twice on the plane flying back to LA. My mummy watched it too. When we landed in LA, I asked what she thought of it and from her point of view, it was stressful. When I saw it twice that time in scenes where Bobby was underwater I was like ""ow. Ow. Ow. My eyes, they burn."" Towards the end of it I was also like ""Ow. Ow. Ow. My eyes and ears hurt.""

1681000,A3GKD8MAHURH91,B00GST8U4U,alltatup,"[2, 3]","I thought this was an absolutely amazing movie, and Redford's performance moved me to tears. He portrays an old man with a lot of fight left in him whose face expresses his awareness of imminant danger, his fears and terrors, his anger, frustration and depression, and his utter exhaustion and physical pain as he battles against the elements and the worst luck a sailor can have. This is really a pure action film because there's very little language--he shouts out ""Help"" a few times--but the sounds of wood cracking, water rushing, waves crashing and the boat struggling to stay upright kept me mesmerized: I was literally gripping my arms across my chest or clasping my hands together in stunned awe at the power of nature, at sea, black sky streaked with lightening, high waves around the boat that block out all else.I was mesmerized by Redford's face: he has aged beautifully and gracefully, and he is old! There is no hiding the fact that he is old--nobly, wisely, solitarily old. He is boney and craggy, he has an old man's mouth, he has aches and pains, and his face shows it all. I see this movie as a great homage to old age: the sailor may not move as quickly as he once did, and he may need to rest more, but nothing will stop his fight to win out against the ever-increasing odds against him. I cried out loud as he contemplated his own imminent death, because he never stops fighting bravely, he never gives up or surrenders to self-pity. I thought to myself, This movie is a lesson on how to face death bravely and with as much humanity as an individual can muster.I was spiritually gripped by this movie, and I am dumbfounded by the fact that Redford wasn't nominated for a Best Actor Oscar: this was one of his most NAKED portrayals of a human being against all odds. I really loved this movie's honesty about facing death and continuing to rage against the dying of the light. Although the critics love it, the audience seems to have had mixed reactions: perhaps it's too naked and truthful for those viewers who are expecting Hollywood to work its magic of fantasizing everything--how people look above all else. Redford's beautiful 78-year-old face told the whole truth and nothing but the truth.",5,THE EXTRAORDINARY FIGHT OF AN OLD MAN AND THE SEA,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,2218,"['thought', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'movie', 'Redford', 'performance', 'moved', 'tears', 'old', 'man', 'lot', 'fight', 'left', 'face', 'awareness', 'imminant', 'danger', 'fears', 'terrors', 'anger', 'frustration', 'depression', 'utter', 'exhaustion', 'physical', 'pain', 'elements', 'worst', 'luck', 'sailor', 'can', 'have', 'really', 'pure', 'action', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'language', 'out', 'Help', 'few', 'times', 'sounds', 'wood', 'cracking', 'water', 'rushing', 'crashing', 'boat', 'struggling', 'stay', 'upright', 'kept', 'mesmerized', 'was', 'literally', 'gripping', 'arms', 'chest', 'clasping', 'hands', 'together', 'stunned', 'awe', 'power', 'nature', 'sea', 'black', 'sky', 'streaked', 'lightening', 'high', 'waves', 'boat', 'out', 'else.I', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'Redford', 'face', 'aged', 'beautifully', 'gracefully', 'old', 'hiding', 'fact', 'old', 'nobly', 'wisely', 'solitarily', 'old', 'boney', 'craggy', 'old', 'man', 'mouth', 'aches', 'pains', 'face', 'see', 'movie', 'great', 'homage', 'old', 'age', 'sailor', 'may', 'not', 'move', 'as', 'quickly', 'once', 'did', 'may', 'need', 'rest', 'more', 'nothing', 'will', 'stop', 'fight', 'win', 'out', 'ever-increasing', 'odds', 'cried', 'out', 'loud', 'contemplated', 'own', 'imminent', 'death', 'never', 'fighting', 'bravely', 'never', 'up', 'surrenders', 'self-pity', 'thought', 'myself', 'movie', 'lesson', 'how', 'face', 'death', 'bravely', 'as', 'much', 'humanity', 'individual', 'can', 'muster.I', 'was', 'spiritually', 'gripped', 'movie', 'am', 'dumbfounded', 'fact', 'Redford', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'NAKED', 'portrayals', 'human', 'being', 'odds', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'honesty', 'facing', 'death', 'continuing', 'rage', 'dying', 'light', 'critics', 'love', 'audience', 'have', 'had', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'perhaps', 'too', 'naked', 'truthful', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'Hollywood', 'work', 'magic', 'fantasizing', 'everything', 'how', 'people', 'look', 'else', 'Redford', 'beautiful', '78-year-old', 'face', 'told', 'whole', 'truth', 'nothing', 'truth']",N/A
1681001,AQWCVDX13E6TV,B00GST8U4U,"Alton Lomas ""waterdweller""","[0, 0]","This film, starring Robert Redford, in a role that involves virtually no dialogue, is fascinating because of many qualities, not the least of which is its understated sound design.Redford is the perfect retiree, sailing a good-sized sloop across the Indian Ocean single-handed, when we catch  up to him 1700 nautical miles from the Sumatra Strait. From then on, what appears to be an idyllic late-in-life adventure goes from disaster to disaster, each one building believably on the last, until his tight yacht is a splintered mess sinking into the sea while he watches from the flimsy confines of a rubber life raft... and the fun is just beginning.I don't want to give too much away, but the way each of the catastrophic events is portrayed (matter-of-fact, understated, yet obviously leading to chaos) is deeply persuasive. The viewer is drawn into the danger precisely because of its understated, low-key presentation.The initial collision with a shipping container that's been washed overboard from a cargo ship is quiet, subdued. The water washing in through the resulting hole is splashing gently, not crashing in like a tidal wave - and as we watch, we become aware of the subtleties of the accident: the navigation computer is shorted out, as is the radio. The engine electrics are flooded, so the engine and pumps are out of commission. Still, the low-key presentation persists. So low-key, in fact, that it reminded me of another similar film of a few years ago: &#34;Open Water&#34;.A brutal storm at night is terrifying in its intensity, but even its natural explosion of waves and water seems strangely quiet, despite the violence being wreaked on the sailboat.The ordered world of his sailboat gives way to the chaos of nature in a slow progression that reminds all of us that our thin facade of predictability is never far away from being dashed to pieces by natural forces. As these natural forces gnaw away at Redford's ancient mariner, his world is reduced in size and complexity until the awful simplicity of the final d&eacute;nouement takes the last shreds away.I'm a part-time, not particularly skillful, sailor - and I've been on many boats of the size and configuration of the one that figures in the first half of this film. The cinematography, the manipulation of small spaces, and their contrast with the wide-open sky of the Indian Ocean made me acutely aware of the limitations of our constructs when facing the oblivious wrath of nature.In fact, the film left me agitated and uneasy. I felt it had conjured up all the fears of being lost on the open ocean that we, as sailors, must tamp down every time we venture into heavy weather.If you're a sailor, see the film. If you're not, see the film anyway. It's worth the shiver to your timbers.",4,Terrifyingly realistic... and Highly Recommended!,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2772,"['film', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'role', 'virtually', 'dialogue', 'fascinating', 'many', 'qualities', 'not', 'least', 'understated', 'sound', 'design.Redford', 'perfect', 'retiree', 'sailing', 'good-sized', 'sloop', 'Indian', 'Ocean', 'single-handed', 'when', 'catch', 'up', '1700', 'nautical', 'miles', 'Sumatra', 'Strait', 'then', 'what', 'be', 'idyllic', 'late-in-life', 'adventure', 'disaster', 'disaster', 'one', 'building', 'believably', 'last', 'tight', 'yacht', 'splintered', 'mess', 'sinking', 'sea', 'flimsy', 'confines', 'rubber', 'life', 'raft', 'fun', 'just', 'beginning.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'way', 'catastrophic', 'events', 'portrayed', 'matter-of-fact', 'understated', 'yet', 'obviously', 'leading', 'chaos', 'deeply', 'persuasive', 'viewer', 'drawn', 'danger', 'precisely', 'understated', 'low-key', 'presentation.The', 'initial', 'collision', 'shipping', 'container', 'been', 'washed', 'overboard', 'cargo', 'ship', 'quiet', 'subdued', 'water', 'washing', 'resulting', 'hole', 'splashing', 'gently', 'not', 'crashing', 'tidal', 'wave', 'watch', 'become', 'aware', 'subtleties', 'accident', 'navigation', 'computer', 'shorted', 'out', 'radio', 'engine', 'electrics', 'are', 'flooded', 'engine', 'pumps', 'are', 'commission', 'Still', 'low-key', 'presentation', 'persists', 'So', 'low-key', 'fact', 'reminded', 'similar', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'ago', '34', 'Open', 'Water', '34', '.A', 'brutal', 'storm', 'night', 'terrifying', 'intensity', 'even', 'natural', 'explosion', 'waves', 'water', 'strangely', 'quiet', 'violence', 'being', 'wreaked', 'sailboat.The', 'ordered', 'world', 'sailboat', 'way', 'chaos', 'nature', 'slow', 'progression', 'thin', 'facade', 'predictability', 'never', 'far', 'away', 'being', 'dashed', 'pieces', 'natural', 'forces', 'natural', 'forces', 'gnaw', 'away', 'Redford', 'ancient', 'mariner', 'world', 'reduced', 'size', 'complexity', 'awful', 'simplicity', 'final', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', 'last', 'shreds', 'away.I', ""'m"", 'part-time', 'not', 'particularly', 'skillful', 'sailor', ""'ve"", 'been', 'many', 'boats', 'size', 'configuration', 'one', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'cinematography', 'manipulation', 'small', 'spaces', 'contrast', 'wide-open', 'sky', 'Indian', 'Ocean', 'made', 'acutely', 'aware', 'limitations', 'constructs', 'when', 'facing', 'oblivious', 'wrath', 'nature.In', 'fact', 'film', 'left', 'agitated', 'uneasy', 'felt', 'had', 'conjured', 'up', 'fears', 'being', 'lost', 'open', 'ocean', 'sailors', 'must', 'tamp', 'down', 'time', 'venture', 'heavy', 'weather.If', ""'re"", 'sailor', 'see', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'see', 'film', 'anyway', 'shiver', 'timbers']",N/A

This movie does try to stand out as it's nearly silent (no dialogues). However, this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen, and I must mention, it's not because I am trying to compare it with other movies.I saw 93% positive ratings on rotten tomatoes and rented it. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Robert Redford himself might be great, but sorry, that does not cut it. There is absolutely no explanation about:1) why he was out there (to begin with)2) what is (or was) he doing being alone (why would you be in the middle of ocean?)and3) where is (or was) he headed to.These unanswered questions are the biggest drawbacks of the movie. Next, the plot has so many loopholes, its unbelievable. ""spoiler alert"" There is a scene at the end where he uses fire, and it is ridiculous to see that he can be so kid-like for what he does. It's certainly a big mistake on scriptwriter and the director.Lastly, this movie has absolutely no entertainment value whatsoever. When you watch him struggle without any logical reason, it bores you to death watching him working on that boat. I mean, at the end, why all is that for? Struggle for life? Good. But then how did you got into trouble in the first place? In short, when you don't get answers to this, then the whole affair seems useless, thereby, actually annoying.All being said, I simply cannot believe that 93% of (so-called) critics liked it. If someone is saying that this is an ""Oscar-worthy"" or ""masterpiece"", they seriously need to do some self critique. I have seen this years Oscar contenders, and believe me, this has no reason to be in that line. Forget about 'masterpiece', this is one of the worst films I have ever seen.

1681005,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00GST8U4U,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","2013 seemed rich with films about survival, about facing unsurmountable odds and coming face to face with your literal fate.  No two movies seemed to get pegged with that label more than &#8216;All is Lost&#8217; and &#8216;Gravity&#8217;, and for most of the first half (and even second half) of last year these two films were compared to one another and pitted against one another and debated as a pair because of their similarities.  Both films offer us an intimate look at ONE person&#8217;s fight for survival; sort of.  You see, where &#8216;Gravity&#8217; takes us on a journey of one woman&#8217;s physical, emotional and mental FIGHT to survive odds that seems utterly unconceivable, &#8216;All is Lost&#8217; shows us one man&#8217;s mental preparation for the inevitable; death.In other words, this is not the story of a fight but a portrait of a man who just gave up.This is in no way, shape or form a knock to the value and quality of this film, but I do think that there is a clear dividing line between the two films and I feel that the distinction should be made because they are not the same film (with a different location) but really they are two separate films taking the same scenario (with a different location) and giving us an entirely different character portrait.When &#8216;All is Lost&#8217; begins, we hear in voiceover our nameless main character (only character) recite his last words, a letter penned on his life-raft.  I don&#8217;t mean to start the review in the negative, but the letter itself was rather vacant in meaning and Redford&#8217;s line delivery was stagnant and emotionless.  I expected a more solemn, more endearing letter and especially delivery because this is supposed to set us up for the film we are about to watch, and in all honesty I wish that it had been cut from the film, because the film itself is much better than that opening would suggest.  Next, the film truly begins, eight days before the letter was written.  Redford is awakened by rushing water as he notices that his boat has struck a container floating in the middle of the ocean and has taken on a large hole and a lot of water.  He dislodges and patches his hole, but his troubles are only beginning.  With drenched electronics and a few maps, Redford is basically a sitting duck for any obstacle, and a terrible storm over the horizon is just the obstacle that is going to wreck his day, week&#8230;life.While this character is obviously resourceful (he mans the boat on his own, takes necessary precautions when he notices the storm looming overhead and even manages to survive when many would have lost their lives almost immediately) but it is clear that this man has resigned himself to death pretty early on.  He prolongs his life as long as possible, but his actions are predominately reactionary, taking what comes to him and not thinking about how he can survive outside of the &#8216;now&#8217;.While some would say that this is a criticism and possibly even find fault with my assumption here, the fact remains that I actually think this angle colors in the character more than it would have had I tried to perceive him as a survivor in the most dramatic sense of the word.  He is a survivor, but his emotional decline (which is mostly wordless and fused together solely on expressions) is what drives the film&#8217;s core.  While many have complained that Redford&#8217;s character basically sits the entire film out, confined to a raft while he watches the world around him crumble, I actually found this aspect of the film fascinating.  True, the film&#8217;s redundancy in many areas is a fault and one that should have been edited better.  There are many scenes that feel similar and don&#8217;t further the point of the film much.  Bad things continue to happen, and there is an impact to be had with that awareness, but by the film&#8217;s end it became a tad too repetitive and that made the film feel less progressive and more stagnant.  Still, as I mentioned, this man&#8217;s subconscious resign to death is what makes this film unique and more meaningful as a whole.  Instead of actively fighting to survive, this man travels through most of the film like a ghost, dwelling in this scenario but never truly living in it.  Even his attempts to be saved feel underdeveloped, but from a cinematic standpoint (because I really think this was the point) but from a personal level.  I feel as though the film was underscoring (subtly, which is why so many can presume these moments are just lazy writing) this man&#8217;s coming to terms with his morality.Redford is very good here.  In a nearly wordless performance, he completely engages who this man is inside and out.  There are so many reactionary scenes that capture such intense humanity without being theatrical or overwhelming.  He WAS this man, and that came through loud and clear.From a technical angle, I found the film to be rather impressive.  The cinematography is exceptional here and really captures so many angles beautifully.  I&#8217;m not just talking about the stunning underwater work (which is stunning) or the wide expanse of the open water, but the lighting used to portray the boat and the lifeboat are stunning in their own right and show such visual range.  I did like the score, but I also found that it was distracting in many scenes and added an overtness that the film was trying to avoid as a whole and so I really wish it hadn&#8217;t been used.  The scenes that are devoid of music work so much better that the ones that utilize it.As a whole, I can understand both sides of this argument.  This film has some devout supporters who consider it a masterpiece and one the finest films of the year.  There are also MANY who consider this a bore and a vacant work of nothing.  I don&#8217;t agree with either sentiment, but I see why those conclusions are being drawn.  For me, &#8216;All is Lost&#8217; has a great central theme and J.C. Chandor&#8217;s handling of this film is pretty impactful, but the film lacks a tightness that I think would have served it well.  It is allowed too much room to drift in some areas, and while I do accept the ambiguous ending as a clear nod to hope (whether he be rescued or taken to heaven), I feel that it was sorely used and didn&#8217;t fit the film properly.Honestly, if you lopped off the film&#8217;s opening and closing and found a way to edit down about ten extra minutes of monotony throughout, this would be perfect.",4,The old man and the sea&#8230;,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,6490,"['2013', 'seemed', 'rich', 'films', 'survival', 'facing', 'unsurmountable', 'odds', 'coming', 'face', 'face', 'literal',

1681011,A8AD6PLQ0PPQE,B00GST8U4U,"Anonymous ""booksandcookies""","[3, 4]","To all the (238 or so as of this date) reviewers who are giving this movie 1 star for being inaccurate in its sailing/boating/navigation elements, I think you are missing the point of the movie.  Plus your gleeful snark at Robert Redford, for some reason, only serves to make YOU sound petty.Maybe it is obvious to say but I'll say it anyway:  this movie was far less about sailing and survival than it was about life, mortality, aging, obstacles, hope, failings, effort, persistence but ultimately the inevitability of death and the reality that we face that absolutely alone.  The ending can be seen as ambiguous - the light, the hand (reminiscent of the hand of God touching Adam's hand in the famous painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel), but my interpretation is not ambiguous (I won't be specific for those who haven't seen the movie.)  It is about the nobility and courage it takes to live, to get old, the futility of striving and yet the magnificence of it.  It may be about the dangers and yet the meaninglessness of man's artifacts (the cargo container, the huge cargo ships), man's place in Nature - and here's the old clich&eacute; again, but always true and always important: how very tiny and insignificant we are, whether a tiny &#34;island&#34; of our own life raft floating on the huge sea on the huge planet in the huge universe - and how &#34;Nature will out&#34; ultimately.  It is about the spirit and soul of man and the attachment to life and living.  Someone mocked the man's shaving his face in the midst of tremendous danger and trauma - but it seemed to me to be his belief in dignity and the patterns of daily life - or it could be, again, the meaninglessness of those very same facets of life. Either way, a strange and pointed reminder of his - man-hood.I thought this film was extraordinary for its deep story with virtually no speaking - just man, Nature, and challenges, one after another. Hard, relentless, tougher and tougher, less and less hope of meeting challenges using man's clever intelligence and ingenuity (as the man had been doing); in the end, it is inadequate and futile.  All is Lost.  Is this about our planet, the environment, each person's life, the profound basics of being a human being?  Yes.As to Robert Redford's performance:  it was amazing.  To think that he is going on 80, I think, and to see him in this physically demanding role (even if there were stuntmen for some of the activities) was astonishing. The fact that he is aging gives weight to the story he is telling about the man.  His marvelous face that has been so gorgeous on the screen for so many years is only moreso now, but in a different way; his wrinkles and age spots tell their own story about life and age and what we all face.  So much more beautiful than the plumped up, smoothed out, artificial and strange looking faces we see in those who are only fooling themselves - and why do they need to try to fool anybody at all? His face is the map of his life, as are the maps he holds trying to find a way to stay alive.  &#34;I'm sorry, &#34; his character's voice says at the beginning of the movie, and we learn later, he is probably writing in a note.  What is he sorry for? He is only human - and that's the story right there - but &#34;only human&#34; is extraordinary, to a point.  All the human tools (sextant, flares, boats, motors) are ultimately worthless when facing death and even the amazing display of human intelligence and inventiveness is ultimately worthless as well.  One thinks of the old Breton prayer: &#34;Oh God, thy sea is so big and my ship is so small.&#34;  (Bronze plaque on wedge shaped wood block with raised lettering that reads 'Oh God thy sea is so great and my boat is so small'.  This Old Breton prayer was given to new submarine captains by Admiral Hyman Rickover who gave this plaque to the President. President Kennedy favored this quote and used in his remarks at the dedication of the East Coast Memorial to the Missing at Sea, May 23, 1963.  He kept the plaque on his desk in the Oval Office.)I would love to think that Robert Redford would read this because it hurts me to see all the negative and nasty comments from people who, in my opinion, show little understanding of what appears to me to be a very profound visual tale of The Most Important Things!  I would like him to know that some of us are amazed by this tale and his performance.  I have always loved his movie of long ago, &#34;Jeremiah Johnson&#34;, a marvelous story of survival, life, death, nature, solitude. &#34;All Is Lost&#34; may be a sort of &#34;Jeremiah Johnson&#34; on the sea at the end of his life.One last thing: it is also very gratifying to see a story told with human beings, not cartoon or computer characters and not a story based on comic books and not a story that is pornography with a fatuous nod to any kind of story and not a slim story as excuse for relentless violence, blowing things up, vile and insane killing.This was about life and age and the randomness of the trials we will face and how we face them.

Adducchio,"[21, 28]","The great acting teacher Sanford Meisner once said, &#34;Acting is Living in Imaginary Circumstances.&#34; Those words have always rung true to me, and a living example can be found in the underrated film, &#34;All Is Lost.&#34; Robert Redford the actor, known only as &#34;Our Man&#34; in this film, is living in imaginary circumstances---alone at sea, in his leaking boat, fighting against the dying of the light for survival. He does so powerfully and the movie holds your attention from beginning to end.The movie &#34;All is Lost&#34; has been grossly overlooked by film critics circles, the Academy, and many of its viewers, as a worthless waste of time, mostly because there's only one actor in the entire film, and because there's hardly any dialogue. I find those arguments to be ridiculous, as the director is only trying to be true to a simple yet powerful story-a man who is falling victim to his overconfidence is desperately trying to stay alive. Put yourself in the situation, if this were real. Would you be speaking a lot if you were alone at sea? Would you be chatting with other people? Of Course Not. And therefore, the director doesn't portray anything like that.One element of a disaster film that makes them interesting and suspenseful, is that the director has to make a choice of whether to take us out of the action or not. Through flashbacks, or something like that, to remove us from the scene of terror for a moment. Chandor wisely never takes us out of the moments, beat by beat, as Our Man has to make important and life-threatening decisions to keep going, or give up.I recommend this film to people that love movies about the sea.

To me, good acting consists of not only hand gestures, facial expressions, and raw emotion, but also heart felt dialogue.  Without dialogue, something just seems to be missing.  Isn't the idea to convince the audience of realism?  An actual person in a like situation would not have been so silent.  It was almost as if the story was being told from a mute's perspective.

1681037,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00GST8U4U,California Dreaming,"[3, 5]","I watched ""Gravity"" earlier in the week, and I loved it, of course.  I thought that the physics were really good, perhaps too good for an American audience.  After all, most Americans get their science ""education"" from watching other sci-fi films, which are usually pretty lame.  Watch any episode of ""Star Trek"" where the stars go flying by the Enterprise as it zooms through space.  If you don't understand what's wrong with that picture, then all is indeed lost.  (I'll give you a hint:  the nearest star to earth, minus of course for our Sun, is something like four light years away.  How long would it take to get to that star, assuming you were traveling as fast as possible, and assuming that Einstein was correct about a ""cosmic speed limit?""  I'm assuming that both are good assumptions.)But I was pretty let down by some of the reviews for ""Gravity"" on this site.  One of them:  ""There were to [sic] many mistakes in Gravity.""  Another:  ""I was really board [sic] by Gravity.""  And finally:  ""There were only two actors in Gravity.  I didn't get my money's worth!""  Now, I don't know about you, but I don't believe that there were ""too"" many errors in that film (other than the odds of survival), and I surely wasn't ""bored"" by it either.  As a matter of fact, it was quite riveting.  And it certainly didn't bother me that there were only two actors in that very fine film that should win an Academy Award; when you've got Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, I would say that two is indeed enough.And what would that person who thought that two actors aren't enough say about this film?  I think we've only got one here, so according to his or her ""math,"" this film should only be worth half as much.  That would be a serious miscalculation, because when you've got Robert Redford, you may as well have a whole army.  And that's even true given his age.  I'll take him still over a handful of these young modern-day actors, most who can't act their way out of a paper bag.And you'll see Mr. Redford here try to work his way out of a ship that's going down.  He tries every trick imaginable to survive, and what else is there?  To me, this is very realistic as it would be very dangerous sailing the world alone; you would have to be a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none kinda guy.  This film reminds me a lot of ""Castaway,"" where I believe that Tom Hanks actually gave the finest performance of his career.  That film had a real documentary feel, and it really worked best when he was alone.  Well, alone with Wilson I suppose.And I feel alone myself, when I read ""reviews"" like the ones that I discussed above.  I really shouldn't read them; they make me really feel that all is indeed lost in America.

A note to screenwriters: KNOW YOUR MATERIAL.From a technical standpoint, Redford does almost everything wrong and the writer appears to know little about sailing. Watch as Redford floods his boat for no reason so he can retrieve his sea anchor! Watch as the impact with the container has nothing to do with the loss of his boat. Watch as Redford tries to radio for help with a coastal VHF radio with 25 mile range. Watch as he tries to hoist a storm sail (And it is actually NOT a storm sail!) after the storm has come. Watch as Redford's boat is dismasted, and the rig is attached with only one halyard! The list of hilarious bad plot points had me shaking my head for two hours. But let's forget that for a moment and remember that the average viewer probably doesn't KNOW how dumb this is. Let's look at the character arc. There is none. Redford's performance is not so much subtle as it is a one note affair. He's slow and methodical in his efforts to survive from the start, moving like a 90 year old man and not someone in their 70s.

The film is in some ways an analogy for the conditions of human life, for the forces of nature and accident work against us and we can either fight against the coming of the cold night or we can give up. Robert Redford plays a man who continues to fight, to not give up, and to accept it all with a certain amount of grace and resolve. Because the film is highly realistic the viewer is really not certain of the outcome for this sailor. The conditions continually worked against him as he tried to survive at sea and any lucky breaks were due to his ingenuity rather than a gift from nature. Robert Redford is excellent playing this mature stoic character.  One reviewer criticized the film for not showing enough character development during this ordeal. I would disagree with this assessment since the character of this man has been set long ago and the film is about the test of that character under the stressful and dangerous conditions that he undergoes. This is not a film about character development; it is a film about character testing.

I'm not suggesting that this is anything approaching a perfect movie.  It isn't.  There are some things in the movie that are pretty hard to believe (e.g., Redford uses some fiberglass and glue to patch a sizable hole in the side of his boat that somehow holds together through two incredibly powerful storms, and actual sailors will find technical faults with many aspects of the film).  That said, though, it took some major stones for Robert Redford to take on this role in a movie that features him as the ONLY actor.There is, of course, virtually no dialogue and the movie at times is, to say the least, uncomfortable to watch because of the dire circumstances Redford finds himself in from the opening scene.  What this film is, though, is a testament to the survival instinct of human beings and to the dogged determination of one man to save his own life.

Something's not right.  And keep in mind, NO viewer invests good time and money in something like ""All Is Lost"" - and roots for it to fail.* The tip-off that ""All Is Lost"" is NOT a mainstream picture came last year - when I noticed it playing at mostly art-house theaters - and NOT at my backyard multi-plex.  Uh-oh.  ""Indie picture, low-budget, not fast-paced, non-linear structure, probably lacks a strong payoff.""* So when I finally saw the picture last night as a rental - I was ready.  I got into ""All Is Lost.""  It gave me an idea of what it might be like to die on the ocean.  (By the way, that last sentence was not a spoiler.)  I could not turn this movie off.  I already knew there would be little to zero dialogue - and yet I was engrossed with the idea of an almost entirely visual story whereby I would be forced to experience everything through Robert Redford, the only actor who's in ""All Is Lost.""  I didn't feel I had to know much about his character, where he came from, how he got on the boat, etc.  I understood what the director was trying to do.* Note that most of the praise from critics has been about Robert Redford's ""near dialogue-free"" performance.  Well, in my view, despite his status as a beloved icon, there are only so many ways Redford can express puzzlement and frustration.  Deprived of an internal monologue, it's hard to emotionally invest in him beyond just wanting him to survive.  If I was stranded on the ocean, I'd be talking to myself ALL THE TIME, with a lot of looney things running through my head.  We get none of that from Redford.* As a result, I think director J. C. Chandor's decision to move forward with an existential story without dialogue isn't a total success.  His film is technically brilliant, jammed with wondrous sounds and images of a nature at war and peace.* But the theme of ""All Is Lost"" never seems more ambitious than just showing what it's like to survive nature's fury.  I've already seen that story elsewhere.  In my view, a picture that tries to ask big questions without covering old territory - really requires an internal monologue or a moody atmosphere - or abstract images like what's found in ""2001"" or in ""The Tree of Life"" - films which force us to think beyond survival and more about our small place in this awesome universe.

How about the very beginning of this messed up movie about a solo sailor who runs into trouble on the high seas? We hear the voice of a man who is about to die, a man apologising for having made mistakes and disappointed people. We realise in hindsight this is the text of a message the unnamed sailor writes as he is about to perish after a series of calamities at sea. But we don't know who is he talking to in the message - family/friends/lovers/business partners perhaps? - and we also have no idea why this 77-year-old is out in the Indian Ocean in the first place. So right from the first few frames we don't really care about the sailor because we don't know who he is or why he is doing what he's doing. Redford's performance is about as creaky as his yacht, which springs a leak after it hits an abandoned shipping container. We see lots of shots of the sails on board the boat, so many so that it smacks of padding. We see lots of shots of Redford leaving the cabin to deal with various calamities outside and lots of shots of him returning. It all comes across as lazy. Redford's damaged yacht runs into a big storm and a series of disasters follow. Some of the cinematography is good but it can't help overcome the biggest flaw of the movie, which is that we don't care a fig about the only protagonist.

1681072,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B00GST8U4U,David R. Eastwood,"[0, 1]","To me, Robert Redford's ALL IS LOST (2013; 106 mins.) was very intense, gripping, and highly enjoyable up until its final two minutes.The plot of ALL IS LOST is almost identical to that of the contemporaneous movie GRAVITY (2013; George Clooney and Sandra Bullock), in which two people are the sole survivors when space debris destroys their space shuttle. GRAVITY is quite a bit more engaging because, unlike with Redford's unnamed and taciturn character, we get to know some of the back-story of Sandra Bullock's character and do get to learn her feelings and thoughts almost non-stop ... and GRAVITY's amazingly similar concluding scene is at least 25 times more plausible than the concluding scene in ALL IS LOST.Redford, however, does an excellent job playing a resourceful elderly sailor suffering a large array of misfortunes during a solo voyage across (apparently) the Indian Ocean. The film begins with him voicing one of just three short speeches: he is sure that ""all is lost"" and is speaking aloud while writing a short farewell note he puts into a bottle. Then the film flashes back eight days to the first major problem he had: a substantial hole has been punched in the side of his fiberglass sailboat by a large floating metal cargo container that has fallen off some ship.At this point many viewers will realize that there are only three possible endings this film can have: Redford's character will die, or Redford's character will suffer terrible permanent damage but will survive, or Redford's character will survive with no serious damage.Faced with this first problem, Redford is silent. We hear only splashing, flowing, and scraping sounds, as Redford calmly sets about freeing his craft from the container, patching the hole, pumping out water, and drying his soaked possessions, which include his radio and his navigation equipment. As the container floats away, there is an ironic, almost humorous moment as hundreds of little sneakers spill out of it into the sea. What else could possibly go wrong?Would you believe his radio works, one-way as a receiver, but for only a few seconds? (""Mayday!"" is another of the speeches Redford delivers, but only we, the viewers of the film, hear his words.) Well, that's pretty bad, but what else could go wrong? Would you believe a typhoon? Would you believe TWO typhoons??The third speech in the film is Redford's one-word expletive beginning with the letter F, following a head injury he receives. Otherwise all our information comes from what we are allowed to see and the non-human sounds we hear. We get no back-story about this man, no explanation for why he is sailing alone or what sort of family he has, not even what his name is. And to me, thin though this is, that is just fine. We don't REALLY need to know these things.Later, when Redford is in his inflated lifeboat, we are treated to several excellent views looking upwards from about 70 feet below the surface of the ocean. Small schools of fish circle beneath his lifeboat, occasionally joined by a dozen or more sharks.And up on the surface, large ships pass by without noticing him, despite all his efforts--which is fully believable in these days of automated vessels with very tiny crews.The tension increases as shortages of food and water become greater and greater problems--until, in the darkness, a bright light appears, and Redford's stressed out, depleted, desperate character responds in a way that seems terribly illogical and THEN ... well, see for yourselves. Up to its final two minutes, I felt this movie was almost equal to THE PERFECT STORM and was far superior to several other ""small craft at sea"" films I'd seen, such as CASTAWAY (with Tom Hanks) and LIFE OF PI (with a young boy and his CGI tiger).I watched this film in a small movie theater and, terribly disappointed with the highly implausible final twist, walked out muttering under my breath.NOTE: To increase their profits, movie makers often film two or more alternative endings which they play for several ""test audiences"" to get an idea which ending the majority of paying viewers will prefer. I was in one such audience about 20 years ago and filled out a questionnaire at the end. I don't know whether ALL IS LOST was made with alternative endings, but if it was, the wrong ending was chosen.",3,INTENSE AND GRIPPING ...

The extent of my knowledge about sailing is reading theAubrey/Maturin novelsa few dozen times.

Robert Redford turns in a bravura performance as a weathered but fit yachtsman who, in normal circumstances, would find this challenging voyage scenic and exhilarating.  However, a series of unfortunate events force him to take desperate measures if he is to have any chance of survival.J. C. Chandor deserves high praise for writing and directing this beautifully photographed and cinematically arresting film.  Although Redford speaks few lines, words are not necessary to express what he is experiencing.  His facial expressions, body language, and intensity are mesmerizing.  Will his impressive nautical skills, ingenuity, resourcefulness, and grace under pressure enable him to pull off a miracle?  Will he find a way to repair his damaged electrical and communication systems; be able to hail a passing boat; and/or manage to make his limited supply of water and rations last?  What kind of man was he before he undertook this odyssey?  Was he running away from something or someone?  We will never know.""All is Lost"" is eloquent, not just as a tale of daring and fortitude, but also as an allegory for life.  We are guaranteed nothing at birth.  Will we be healthy, have a loving partner and devoted children, and earn a living doing something that we love?  Or will we endure illness, financial setbacks, rejection, and loneliness?  When we are brought low by circumstances, we can choose to face our struggles courageously or surrender to despair.  If we decide to persist and fight, like the aforementioned sailor, at least we know that we tried.Robert Redford is quoted as saying, ""To me, it was always the climb up the hill.

1681091,A3S1YIQQW7AZO,B00GST8U4U,EMAN NEP,"[2, 5]","All Is Lost tells the story of a 77-year old cargo-ship pirate. He cleverly uses a yacht because who would ever suspect a yacht of being a pirate ship?The irony in this is that instead of capturing a cargo ship he hits a cargo container that punctures the side of his boat. After freeing himself from the cargo container, he is then so mad at it that he rams it head-on and then--in an effort to make lemonade out of lemons--he takes a look at the cargo which just turns out to be every woman's dream and every married man's worst nightmare: SHOES!Left speechless by this series of unfortunate events, he proceeds to repair his ship with carbon fiber, maple syrup and duct tape. Unfortunately these repairs come a bit late because the fact of the matter is that his ship is already partly flooded with sea-water. He quite literally has a water-bed.After fixing his water-soaked electronic equipment, he radios an SOS in English . . . to some people who don't speak English.Next, he pulls himself up the mast to get a better look at what he could have seen with so much less effort on the deck--a terrible storm. (Okay, to be fair, he did have to go up the mast to reconnect those audio cables).In preparation for the big storm he shaves his already clean-shaven face and does the dishes.When the storm hits, his boat is flipped over to allow him a better view of the underwater creatures and then conveniently flips back over when he is done looking. His carbon fiber and maple syrup repair works so well that even MacGyver would be envious.Then he finds a tiger on his . . . no, wait, wrong movie . . .He weathers this storm only to be hit by another. This time the storm just further shows that his yacht is really more of a kayak by how conveniently and easily it does barrel rolls.In preparation to abandon ship, he deploys his liferaft and attaches it to his yacht so that if the yacht sinks, so does the liferaft.On board the raft he takes stock of his supplies--a knife that is probably the cause of a future leak, a 5 gallon jug of Pinesol that he used to mop the inside of his yacht with earlier, a sextant to show him how miserably lost he is, a bag of condoms and a ping pong paddle with dental floss (I know dental floss worked wonders for Austin Powers but I'm not so sure about this situation).While looking at a map he realizes that his raft is coming closer to the cargo shipping lanes! Yes! Unfortunately this movie takes place after the events in Captain Phillips so the cargo ships know full well that he is just a crafty pirate and pass him by not once but twice.Things are looking bad for him. Refusing to go to Bear Grylls extremes he tries to drink the Pinesol but predictably has to spit it out. Also his face is melting off because he has a perfectly good hat that he refuses to wear. Because the hot noon-day sun is not hot enough for him he also puts on a sweater over the sweater he is already wearing.Finally one night there is hope--A light from a small boat in the middle of the Indian Ocean. One can only assume two things: 1) They are either cargo ship pirates like himself or 2) They are just as lost as he is--and probably cannibals.In a moment of great mental clarity he sets fire to his jug of Pinesol and gets so carried away that he burns down his raft. The cannibals/pirates finally spot him and the movie ends.Viewed in this light, the movie is clearly 4 or even 5 star material, but taken seriously I can only give it 3.",3,PARODY REVIEW,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,3462,"['Lost', 'tells', 'story', '77-year', 'old', 'cargo-ship', 'pirate', 'cleverly', 'yacht', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'suspect', 'yacht', 'being', 'pirate', 'ship', 'irony', 'instead', 'capturing', 'cargo', 'ship', 'cargo', 'container', 'side', 'boat', 'freeing', 'cargo', 'container', 'then', 'so', 'mad', 'head-on', 'then', 'effort', 'make', 'lemonade', 'lemons', 'look', 'cargo', 'just', 'out', 'be', 'woman', 'dream', 'married', 'man', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'SHOES', 'Left', 'speechless', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'repair', 'ship', 'carbon', 'fiber', 'maple', 'syrup', 'duct', 'tape', 'Unfortunately', 'repairs', 'come', 'bit', 'late', 'fact', 'matter', 'ship', 'already', 'partly', 'flooded', 'sea-water', 'quite', 'literally', 'water-bed.After', 'fixing', 'water-soaked', 'electronic', 'equipment', 'radios', 'SOS', 'English', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English.Next', 'mast', 'get', 'better', 'look', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'effort', 'deck', 'terrible', 'storm', 'Okay', 'be', 'fair', 'did', 'have', 'go', 'up', 'mast', 'reconnect', 'audio', 'cables', '.In', 'preparation', 'big', 'storm', 'already', 'clean-shaven', 'face', 'dishes.When', 'storm', 'boat', 'flipped', 'allow', 'better', 'view', 'underwater', 'creatures', 'then', 'conveniently', 'back', 'when', 'done', 'looking', 'carbon', 'fiber', 'maple', 'syrup', 'repair', 'so', 'well', 'even', 'MacGyver', 'would', 'be', 'envious.Then', 'tiger', 'wait', 'wrong', 'movie', '.He', 'weathers', 'storm', 'only', 'be', 'hit', 'time', 'storm', 'just', 'further', 'yacht', 'really', 'more', 'kayak', 'how', 'conveniently', 'easily', 'barrel', 'rolls.In', 'preparation', 'abandon', 'ship', 'liferaft', 'yacht', 'so', 'yacht', 'sinks', 'so', 'liferaft.On', 'board', 'raft', 'stock', 'supplies', 'knife', 'probably', 'cause', 'future', 'leak', '5', 'gallon', 'jug', 'Pinesol', 'used', 'mop', 'inside', 'yacht', 'earlier', 'sextant', 'show', 'how', 'miserably', 'lost', 'bag', 'condoms', 'ping', 'pong', 'paddle', 'dental', 'floss', 'know', 'dental', 'floss', 'worked', 'wonders', 'Austin', 'Powers', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'situation', 'looking', 'map', 'raft', 'coming', 'closer', 'cargo', 'shipping', 'lanes', 'Yes', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'place', 'events', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'cargo', 'ships', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'just', 'crafty', 'pirate', 'pass', 'not', 'once', 'twice.Things', 'are', 'looking', 'bad', 'Refusing', 'go', 'Bear', 'Grylls', 'drink', 'Pinesol', 'predictably', 'spit', 'out', 'Also', 'face', 'melting', 'off', 'perfectly', 'good', 'hat', 'wear', 'hot', 'noon-day', 'sun', 'not', 'hot', 'enough', 'also', 'sweater', 'sweater', 'already', 'wearing.Finally', 'one', 'night', 'hope', 'light', 'small', 'boat', 'middle', 'Indian', 'Ocean', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'two', 'things', '1', 'are', 'cargo', 'ship', 'pirates', '2', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'lost', 'probably', 'cannibals.In', 'moment', 'great', 'mental', 'clarity', 'fire', 'jug', 'Pinesol', 'so', 'carried', 'away', 'down', 'raft', 'cannibals/pirates', 'finally', 'spot', 'movie', 'ends.Viewed', 'light', 'movie', 'clearly', '4', 'even', '5', 'star', 'material', 'taken', 'seriously', 'can', 'only', 'give', '3']",N/A

He quickly makes repairs and continues on his way but fate has worse in store.  He barely has time to clean up the damage from the leak before a huge storm hits.  The rest of the movie takes place over the eight harrowing days that he is alone and adrift and must come to terms with what he has made of his life.  Rarely has a movie affected me so deeply that I sit and shout at the screen while watching but I was doing that with this movie. You keenly feel the hope as he sights a ship and the disappointment when his flares goes unnoticed.  All of the emotion is conveyed through the nuances of a facial expression or the slump of shoulders.  Redford inhabits this man perfectly.  In my humble opinion, he should receive all the awards for this performance which was done without grand special effects or mounds of crafty dialouge.  I highly recommend this film.  It's hard to watch at times but you will definitely come away with a deeper sense of gratitude for the little things we all take for granted.",5,One Man's Struggle to Survive,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,1447,"['How', 'can', 'movie', 'one', 'character', 'probably', 'less', '30', 'words', 'total', 'movie', 'pack', 'such', 'emotional', 'punch', 'Well', 'when', 'one', 'man', 'portrayed', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'words', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'was', 'immediately', 'immersed', 'life', 'nameless', 'man', 'who', 'traversing', 'ocean', 'alone', 'awakened', 'one', 'morning', 'boat', 'rammed', 'floating', 'cargo', 'container', 'huge', 'hole', 'side', 'craft', 'quickly', 'repairs', 'way', 'fate', 'worse', 'store', 'barely', 'time', 'clean', 'up', 'damage', 'leak', 'huge', 'storm', 'hits', 'rest', 'movie', 'place', 'eight', 'harrowing', 'days', 'alone', 'adrift', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'made', 'life', 'Rarely', 'movie', 'affected', 'so', 'deeply', 'sit', 'shout', 'screen', 'watching', 'was', 'doing', 'movie', 'keenly', 'feel', 'hope', 'ship', 'disappointment', 'when', 'flares', 'unnoticed', 'emotion', 'conveyed', 'nuances', 'facial', 'expression', 'slump', 'shoulders', 'Redford', 'man', 'perfectly', 'humble', 'opinion', 'should', 'receive', 'awards', 'performance', 'was', 'done', 'grand', 'special', 'effects', 'mounds', 'crafty', 'dialouge', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'will', 'definitely', 'come', 'away', 'deeper', 'sense', 'gratitude', 'little', 'things', 'take', 'granted']",N/A

1681104,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00GST8U4U,FNDNreview,"[5, 8]","Directed by J.C. Chandor (Margin Call), All is Lost stars Robert Redford (his character's name is never revealed) as the lone occupant of a lost-at-sea vessel, named the ""Virginia Jean.""  After awakening to find water pouring into his boat, he quickly realizes that it has crashed into a large storage container, which has been aimlessly floating in the Indian Ocean.  The incoming water damages his radio and navigation system, cutting off his communication capabilities.  Although he manages to patch the hole to his hull and use celestial navigation to pinpoint his location, he is still ill-equipped to contend with the impact of being on the ocean during a major storm.  With his boat severely damaged and lacking supplies, he is forced to coup with the growing possibility that he will be unable able to survive.With the critical acclaim of 2012's Life of Pi, which earned director Ang Lee an Academy Award win, someone was bound to recycle the same idea - and that someone happens to be J.C. Chandor.  Naturally, it's difficult to look at this film without being reminded of Life of Pi, since it does seem rather convenient that another film of this nature is released only a year removed from wild success of Life of Pi.  Regardless of how enjoyable Life of Pi was - All is Lost is simply better.  Not only is it better, it's far more realistic, and removes the endless array of thematic, religious overtones that caused so much discussion and analysis after the initial release of Life of Pi.  Chandor's vision introduces a real-life scenario, along with a series of free-flowing emotions that are brought out in an individual while being stranded at sea.It's safe to say there are only a few actors that have the skill to star in an isolated character role like this and keep the audience's attention - and Robert Redford is one of them.  Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away and Sandra Bullock in Gravity, Redford is at his very best when all of the attention is on him. From the beginning of the film to the end, the only face you'll see and voice you'll hear is his - meaning you'll quickly have to get comfortable with the idea of the absence of dialogue (aside from a few words here and there).  For an actor well into his 70s, he still clearly demonstrates his mastery of acting.As the film progresses, Redford takes his character through the natural state of fear, and eventually experiences frustration, anger, and finally, acceptance.  He manages to accomplish all of this by using nothing more than the simplest facial expressions and interacting with inanimate objects.  Redford's nameless character does everything in his power to prove that he (who you'll biographically know nothing about) has the desire to survive this frightening predicament.  This portrayal is so flawless that it would be the ultimate snub if Robert Redford were not at least nominated for an Academy Award.  Early odds point to him earning a Lead Actor nomination and in the event that he won, he'd be the first person to win the award as both an actor and director.Honestly, the positive adjectives in which to describe Redford's performance are endless, particularly because he portrays a character without any sort of back story or character elaboration.  You can call his portrayal anything from moving and emotional to nerve-wracking and gripping.  In spite of everything, his character is only as powerful as the story that has been written for him.  Again, J.C. Chandor has written this story under the simple premise that anything that can go wrong will go wrong.  Even in the brief opening dialogue from Redford, his character openly admits to whoever he's speaking that ""all is lost"" - so right off the bat, there's an intense tone that's been set for the direction in which this film is headed.  First, there's a gaping hole in the boat to contend with, followed by various issues aboard the boat from water damage, and then, eventually the weather takes a turn for the worst.  When the weather calms, this character is faced with dwindling supplies, and flailing hope.  One thing is for sure, you won't look at water the same way after witnessing the nail-biting course of events in this film.Robert Redford's acting and the story are simply exquisite, but we don't often take time to fully appreciate the special effects that go into a small market film of this nature.  Gravity was a huge box office sensation, full of spectacular visuals, but oceanic visuals are far less mesmerizing than the sheer beauty of outer space.  Instead, the chaotic setting of an angry ocean has to be interpreted and depicted in a serious manner.  Obviously, this all takes place while Redford is within a controlled setting aboard a boat that's doing much more than just rocking back and forth.  In one scene, Redford is tossed overboard and another scene his boat completely flips over, and he clearly has to struggle underwater against the water-based elements in order to get himself back aboard his vessel.  While this may not seem all that impressive in comparison to an outer space-based setting, keep in mind that Robert Redford is 77 years old.  It's not just Redford's emotional acting that makes this role spectacular, it's also the fact that he does all of his own stunts - many of which don't look all that pleasant.Overall, All is Lost incorporates every element that a film requires to be entertaining and emotionally charged.  This is a sobering story that features even the most realistic elements, which is evident in the fact that Redford's character, despite his thirst, can't drink ocean water due to the high salt content, and can't catch fish because of the attention they bring from sharks.  Despite the most thoughtful inventions, like the inflatable safety raft and supply kit, survival still requires a substantial amount of luck - and it's painfully evident this main character is devoid of that particular good fortune.  Much like the conclusion to Life of Pi, All is Lost has already garnered quite a bit of attention over an ending that is open to interpretation.  Obviously, you'll have to see the movie to fully understand, but this happens to be one of those stories where you (the viewer) decide the fate of the character.  Any way you look at it and taking into account the traumatic series of events that this character must endure over an eight day span, the end result is cinematically acceptable no matter what your individual opinion happens to be on the matter.GRADE:  A-FNDNreview.com",5,"Robert Redford flawless in the oceanic drama, 'All is Lost'",1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,6509,"['Directed', 'J.C.',

First his boat goes, then his life raft begins to take on water. And that's when it happens. Redford lets out an ""F"" bomb that is so intense and commanding it seems possible that it could be heard throughout the entire Indian Ocean. Redford, in this moment, makes the King of ""F"" Bombs, Al Pacino, seem timid.I find it very difficult to believe that anyone could not strongly identify with Redford's character. Certainly almost everyone has been in this situation. Inner turmoil combined with an overwhelming external attack coming from someone or something resulting in...an explosion.

Redford wakes up to find his boat has been holed by a drifting container.  He breaks out his fiberglass repair kit and makes a reasonably decent patch - but that's about the only smart thing he does.  He stores his self-inflating life raft down below in the cabin (any sailor with half a brain would keep it in one of the cockpit lazarettes).  Same with his sea anchor.  When he needs to do some celestial navigation, he has to pull his sextant out from under a settee.  And guess what - it's still in its delivery/shipping carton!  And he doesn't seem to know how to use it to bring the sun down to the horizon - he just holds it up to his eye, and gets a three-point fix without having to work a star chart.

1681112,AU10YGO10MUCA,B00GST8U4U,Gary Lee,"[2, 3]","I happened to see this film on the same day as THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL.  The downbeat, ultra-realistic adventure of ALL IS LOST compared to the wedding cake confection of Wes Anderson's fairy tale was quite a contrast.  Even fairy tales and fantasies can have profound meaning, but Anderson's films just aren't about anything at all--HOTEL seem pointless and forgettable compared to this gripping tale of man against the elements that had a great deal more to say about what life and human character are all about.ALL IS LOST could be viewed as a poetic myth of a man's fall and redemption.  It begins its descent with his complacency (he's asleep comfortably in his boat when a dire accident occurs).  His composure slowly disintegrates as he realizes he's trapped, his strength and skills may not be adequate for him to save himself as he is taken down inexorably into a sort of watery hell.  The final shot is unforgettable, and has existential force.  At the moment he is completely broken down and surrenders all, he gains all.It's perhaps the most brilliant and economical resolution of a story since the final shot of NORTH BY NORTHWEST.Gutsy film, nicely done, not easy to forget.  Packs more of a wallop in terms of life lessons than the last survival at sea saga I saw, the pretentious LIFE OF PI.  Yes, I'm sure sailors can't resist critiquing the Redford character's actions and strategies for rescue.  As a sailor of very limited experience, the only point where I had trouble suspending disbelief was when he was fumbling with his flares.  It's hard to imagine that any seasoned sailor who knew he was drifting into a shipping lane wouldn't prepare by having his flares all ready to go  He would know exactly how many he has and how they operate beforehand.Redford doesn't seem to be acting at all, as other reviewers have said, but it is precisely his skillful restraint that is his accomplishment here.  We forget that this is our renowned, handsome Hollywood icon Robert Redford in peril (Oh no, not our hero!).  We just follow the struggles of an ordinary guy to survive, unsure of what the outcome will be.  It would have been so easy for Redford to overact, to mug, to fall back on his famous mannerisms, to trade on well-worn tricks.  Redford never succumbs to that temptation for an instant.

Before the boat sinks, after a day or two, the man sets up his lifeboat, a rubber dinghy, and transfers some supplies. He stays above water with a shrinking base of tools and necessities, through storms and nights, with shrinking hope.The most awesome moments of this not very original, but impressive, minimalist adventure film are two encounters with passing container ship giants. Both rush past like ghost ships, no living soul in sight, just a mountain of steel boxes.Also very impressive is the underwater filming. We watch Redford's boat from below, against the sunny sky, surrounded by schools of fish, and more and more by larger fish, and then sharks.Redford is an ideal casting for the nearly speechless only character of the story. At the opening, we hear him speak a last message in the off, ending with: all is lost. It sounds as if he dictated it, but that is later shown as a wrong impression. The man has written a message in a bottle...During the story, we hear him mumbling a little now and then, but the only word that he pronounces loudly and clearly is one that I can't quote here. I would have said that much more often. My manners leave much to be desired. People with good manners, do they have better survival prospects? Just kidding.Zero dialogue. Nobody to talk to anyway. How would Conrad have told this story?Some reviewers say that the film makers know nothing about the ocean or sailing. I wouldn't claim to know better. Some of Redford's actions did appear to be hard to understand. I wouldn't know if he acted in an incompetent way, or if he is just overwhelmed und helpless.

That's exactly what this film does, and it does a great job of not just giving the audience something to watch but really pulls you in.

1681141,AEGOH3LUD467S,B00GST8U4U,"Jerry W. Scott ""2totango""","[9, 14]","First of all, I loved this film. Redford's performance was outstanding. The camera work was also marvelous. In a word, kudos to all who worked on this terrific film. By now, most readers know the plot so I will dispense with summarizing it and only mention what I found devastatingly wrong with this movie. I have been a sailor (sailboats) most of my life. I studied seamanship at the US Naval Academy and have owned four sailing vessels. One never learns everything in the world of sailing, but there are certain things you do learn that went missing in this engrossing film. I cannot believe that there wasn't a technical adviser around when they were filming.  Here's what I spotted, things that even a beginner learns right away:1) At no time was Redford wearing a life jacket despite the cardinal rule about using them especially when you are out on the water alone. When he goes forward to put up the storm sail he clips himself to the life line but fails to put on the life jacket. This is not believable. No experienced sailor would be so dumb. Did he have a death wish?2) His navigation system goes out so he digs out a sextant. Backup GPS devices cost $100. Why didn't he have one rather than relying on an instrument that requires logarithm tables and a chronometer to calculate your position?  At best on a tossing sea in a raft your location would be miles from where you think you are using a sextant. .3) He is calling for help on a VHS radio. A VHS radio has at best a 35-50 miles range. Where was his satellite phone, single side band transceiver or emergency beacon EPRIB? (here's more than you want to know but just in case...""An Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon or EPIRB is used to alert search and rescue services in the event of an emergency.It does this by transmitting a coded message on the 406 MHz distress frequency via satellite and earth stations to the nearest rescue co-ordination centre. Some EPIRBs also have built-in GPS which enables the rescue services to accurately locate you to +/- 50 metres. EPIRBs are generally installed on boats and can either be operated automatically after an incident or manually. In most countries they are mandated to be used in all commercial shipping. However, they are also used on yachts and leisure boats."").Nobody goes sailing around the world without a EPRIB. Period. That the sailor was adrift without a backup navigation and rescue aid save the sextant is another stupidity.4)  Why didn't he have a proper handle for the bilge pump?  How could he not? when the water started coming in, his automatic electric pump (with float switch) would have alerted him to the impending situation. He wasted time sharpening a stick to use. Yeah, right.5) He failed to have enough flares on board. Why?6) There are water purifiers that work on the principle of osmosis. One should have been in the life raft. Another mistake.  Just like the lack of an emergency kit with sunscreen in the raft, etc etc.7. SPOILER ALERT: How do you decide to die and sink into the abyss and still able to see the surface after a minute or two (film time)? Oh boy, after he sees the light above he swims up as if he'd just entered the water..Notice that as he went down he held his breath reluctant to get it over with. It didn't make sense to me.8.

1681148,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B00GST8U4U,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[4, 6]","All is Lost shouldn't have worked as a film. All is Lost doesn't have complex story, no back story for our lone character, no limited dialogue, no interaction with any other characters, and without any battles or explosions in the film yet the film does work. All is Lost has nothing except a lone man trying to survive being stranded alone in the vast Indian Ocean. Our man doesn't have a volleyball named Wilson, a Tiger, or fellow astronaut for companionship. All our man has is himself, and his will to survive until all is lost, and yet All is Lost works simply because of veteran actor Robert Redford who gives a magnificent performance in his best film, and acting performance in over a decade.&#34;I'm sorry. I know that means little at this point, but I am. I tried. I think you would all agree that I tried. To be true, to be strong, to be kind, to love, to be right, but I wasn't.&#34;That is how All is Lost opens with part of the longest dialogue in the film when a moving voice over by an unknown man begins. The man who sounds like he has been through an ordeal, and has fought hard to survive has finally given up, and is saying goodbye, and then the film cuts to eight days earlier where we see a long man sleeping peacefully in a cabin of his boat the Virginia Jean. The man is awoken when a load crash is heard and water begins to pour into the cabin. Rushing out onto the deck he finds that a floating shipping container has crashed into his boat gashing a whole into the side of the boat. Our man quickly works to get the shipping container dislodged from the boat as the cabin is continued to be flooded with water. We watch as the man efficiently gets the container dislodged, repairs the side of the boat, and pumps the water out of the cabin.Unfortunately for our men the electronics on the Virginia Jean are now not working or broken, and his dying radios SOS cry for help aren't heard leaving the man stranded and alone. We watch the triumphs, and failures as the man fights for survival alone on the Indian Ocean. We see all this without only about three words of dialogue, which makes it even more emotional when our man realizes he made a simple yet costly mistake yelling a four letter word into the sky. I don't think I've heard a cursed word used so effectively or with such emotion before in a film. The man's lone journey culminates in a beautiful and moving climax that is inconclusive leaving us to form our own opinion. I did struggled with giving away the ending, but just want to say that the conclusion or lack thereof gives deeper meaning to the opening dialogue as we all try to be true to ourselves and others, to love unconditionally, and to be kind yet have failed in some degree. I know I have failed many times in my life yet it is the journey, and decisions that define us as well desire to let the people we know and love that we did our best in life.Throughout Robert Redford's over five decade acting career the seventy seven year old Redford has given us many memorable and great acting performances Johnny Hooker in The Sting, The Sundance Kid in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Roy Hobbs in The Natural, Bob Woodward in All the President's Men, and Nathan D. Muir in Spy Game, with a future performance in the upcoming Captain America: The Winter Soldier yet his role in All is Lost is different, and more complex than his other roles as the experienced actor has no other actors rely on, and very little dialogue. Instead Redford must act only with his eyes, facial expressions and body language, and Redford achieves that in All is Lost. Redford as lost man wonderfully displays the emotions of a lost man at sea from his frustration, hopefulness/hopelessness, triumphs, and acceptance. I believe few actors could as an effective performance as Robert Redford does with so little to work with.All is Lost isn't for everyone, and some might not appreciate what they are viewing, but All is Lost shouldn't be missed. Not director J. C.

There's the obvious layer of a thrilling survival story, complete with ups and downs and drama and struggle. But then there's the deeper level that I felt: humans versus their mortality. A modern Job in his &#34;boat,&#34; his life, his body, up against the world and all its attempts to undo him. In fact, when we consider our lives, all indeed is lost. Inevitably, we are going down to the bottom, no matter how hard we patch things up, fixate on the infinite beauty around us, dream of better days, comb our hair and shave our faces. To me this movie presents our existential predicament. There's Redford, drifting alone at sea. We know absolutely nothing about him: why he's there, what's happened to him in his life, what he wants, where he's going. He's just there, like you and me are in our lives, on a living sea, with the sky above, the earth below, and the air in between. Redford plays this role of Everyman perfectly. A brilliantly nuanced performance takes him from relative ease with his circumstance to the inevitable. All we hear are natural sounds, and a single wail of frustration and pain from Redford. What happens at the end? Spoiler alert: Down he goes, but then a hand reaches out and he's raised into a blinding white light. My take: He physically died, but then lovingly is brought into the next journey. A loving hand reached out to him and took him somewhere beyond the moving image and the physical world.Because this movie allowed me to have this interpretation, even if you, dear reader, think I'm nuts, I love it.

If you usually like movies that involve a city being completely annihilated by a large lizard--this movie isn't for you.  If you usually like movies that look like one big 2 hour Addidas commercial--this movie is not for you.  You will honestly hate this movie.  Just go back in the living room and continue playing your video game and leave the adults to talk in peace.  Thank you.All kidding aside (not really) I find it incredibly ironic that movies about real life and our actual reality is panned by people yet movies about a mailbox that turns into a Transformer is the new Citizen Kane.  Oh and dumb people: in case you didn't know Citizen Kane is supposed to be like the best movie ever.  It's like totes epic.  Do people still say the word totes?  Anyway back to this movie: an old guy is out on a boat, crap happens and he tries to not die.  He's in the middle of nowhere, no food, no electricity (that means no iPhone..OMG OMG OMG OMG), death is absolutely guaranteed unless he doesn't find help.  Umm...that sounds kinda stressful.  Okay--scary as hell!  Of course, all off this would be lost on those who don't know how to feel fear anymore.  When you watch enough Michael Bay movies this tends to happen. You lose your sense of feeling...well anything. It's become an epidemic (or is it ""pandemic?"" Damn, didn't the movie Outbreak teach me anything??  Note to self: watch the movie Contagion...and also Outbreak).  Hey people: movies aren't all supposed to be about teenager girls going on spring break road trips (okay, sometimes they can be)  It can be about real life too, ya know? You remember that doncha?  Real life?  It's that thing that happens when you look up from your phone and you realize you're heading right into the car in front of you. Real life.  Wikipedia it.This movie is emotional, it's gripping and it will keep you on your toes.  Lose yourself in the movie and put yourself in the character's shoes.  How would you survive?  Not so well probably.  Well, let's see how this guy survives.  There is almost no dialogue at all in the movie yet I hear what Redford is saying in every scene.  His impeccable performance guides us gracefully through the film and because it is filmed so wonderfully you forget nothing is being said at all.  The truth is each scene tells you so much.  I felt fear for Redford also hope, frustration and sadness.  The film takes you along in a very calculated and controlled way.  It is very subtle yet can be very intense.  Isn't that odd?  How can something so restrained be so explosive?  This movie succeeds in finding out.Movies like this don't exist in 2014--and they really shouldn't.  They stick out like a sore thumb and no one watches them and if they do, they'll think it's boring because ""no one said nothing.""  Thankfully, there are still some good folks out there that still care about good storytelling and incredible performances.  Fans of good old fashioned acting will dig this film.  It's about telling a story from beginning to end.  No tricks, no slight of hand.  Just great acting and wonderful direction.  Okay this is the end of the review.

I mean I get the whole man versus nature thing that the movie is portraying here but I am afraid that it has been done before and done much better (Life of Pi, Castaway, and Perfect Storm for example) I have several issues with the movie, first there is no back story at all. Why is he sailing solo? Who is this man? Why is he in the middle of the ocean in the first place? What is his story? Why if he is sailing solo does he make very poor decisions in an emergency? Why is he so unprepared for an emergency? Things like that. I am all for the premise of the movie, but give me something to know and care about the character. Unfortunately this movie doesn't. I only see an inept sailor who frankly does a very poor job at the decisions he makes throughout. Secondly, there is very little or no dialogue, maybe 20 words at most through the whole movie (maybe they were paying per word I don't know) which leads to a very dry and slow moving boring movie. Give me something, a back narrative, the character talking to himself, or explaining some of the things that he is doing, which to those who aren't familiar might not be aware. The problem is not the premise here, but the problem is the lack of any kind of story that gives you anything to keep you interested and motivated in watching.To give it credit though, the storm sequences are definitely well done and realistic but in between the long stretched of boredom, there is very little else here to keep you watching. Some people who have given it a good rating and say it is a thinking man's movie. I will agree with that to a point, you will be thinking what to do during the movie to keep yourself awake and what to do after you finish watching.This movie is the type that you will either love or hate with very little in between.  Some will enjoy the artistic style that this movie displays by showing the symbolism for life and being alone at sea.  But for me personally, All is lost is too slow moving, has very little dialogue of any type, with no back story, and no real story at all which makes me give this the rating I do.

We never learn why the main character (credited as &#34;Our Man&#34; - we never learn his name) is at sea in the first place. The film should have opened with his discovery that a shipping container had pierced his hull, and not the apology to unknown and unseen people (his family? Co-workers? His pets?), with its implication that he was about to &#34;give up.&#34; With the relentless battle of Man Against the Sea, the outcome was far from certain at any point in the film. The character comes across as a seasoned sailor, almost unemotional in the face of what most people would consider to be terrifying and devastating events. His only strong reaction is to the discovery that his water container has been contaminated, and he gets past that obstacle fairly quickly.Almost experimental in its sparseness, the film relies on our interest in what the main character is doing at any given moment and how he will deal with the periodic disasters he is subjected to. What was missing was some sense of transcendence. I'm not sure how that could have been achieved; maybe through flashbacks to events in his life, or even the surrealism of visions, sea monsters, or some suggestion of how a shipwrecked person passes the time by themselves. The film did a fine job presenting the danger and excitement of a shipwreck; what it utterly failed to communicate was the unbearable tedium of the endless hours when nothing is happening, when the character must have been alone with his thoughts and nothing else. In the end, the real adversary is not the sea - it is his own mind. You would never get that from &#34;All Is Lost.&#34;I have no explanation for the critical acclaim (despite the Academy's failure to nominate this film for any award) other than a reaction to Redford's admittedly understated yet intense performance, and the decidedly &#34;un-Hollywood&#34; minimalist presentation.

Like especially Redford's very calm demeanor throughout ordeal, starting with the very first -- actually, with what should have been the very first -- scene. Redford awakens w a jolt, finds boat taking on water. He calmly surveys the situation, not even a suggestion that this is a time to abandon ship. And I like the scenes that demonstrate he clearly is an expert sailor (though expert sailors have commented here that that's not the case): I like how he works the wheel, knows when to put on what gear, has all the right clothing (not sure where he's plucking it all from on the life raft), like how he uses the ....gurney to fix the boat (though a dicey repair job for sure), and to get to the top of the mast -- to do what, I have no idea.But some quibbles, the first a big one, back to that first scene: the first scene in the film is totally unnecessary and it has been done SO MANY TIMES BEFORE. We first see the end of the protagonist's story/journey, the desperate endgame, his dire situation, followed by the oh-so-usual graphic: 'Eight Days Earlier.' There is absolutely no need for that. The film should have started with Redford waking after hitting the container.Second quibble: I get that the director wanted as little dialogue/talking as possible, but really: a guy on his own at sea? Facing one disaster after another? Wouldn't he be talking to himself a lot more?And three: SPOLIER: the boat that rescues him at the end... what is that? A 12-foot fishing boat?

1681209,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00GST8U4U,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","Robert Redford has been an actor I've loved and hated. I've loved him when he was acting in roles that were memorable. I've hated him when he chose to force his political views into his roles. When I saw that ALL IS LOST was coming out I was afraid it would be just another film where his environmental views were the sole function of the film. I was pleasantly surprised to find I was wrong.ALL IS LOST is a different kind of movie. There is perhaps one page of dialogue in the whole film, most of that spoken off camera as the film opens. Within minutes we are taken back 8 days to when all that follows is set in motion.Redford plays the man, a nameless character in his mid seventies who wakes to find water flowing into his sailboat. He notes a hole in the side of the cabin and goes topside to find out what happened. A shipping container lost from a cargo ship is floating in the vast ocean, releasing tons of low costs tennis shoes and it's corner is inserted into side of his boat. First he must get his boat unattached from the container and then repair it.He does this never breaking a sweat. Redford's character is cool under stress and uses his mind to great advantage. Making minor repairs he sets out to see what damage was done. Of course his radio was right under where the puncture took place leaving him with no way to call for help. Knowing he must take care of himself he does just that. But if that's all that happened this movie would have been about 80 minutes shorter.If anything can go wrong it does. Obstacles like fresh water, food rationing, eventually a storm that re-damages his boat and more all become obstacles he must surmount. And while his cool attitude contends with each obstacle it's clear to see on his face that each one is taking its toll. His character isn't as simple as you believe when the film starts. Instead you see how each item changes him and forces him to evaluate everything going on around him. At his age should he invest so much time and effort into trying to remain alive? Will help reach him in time should he carry on? Has he done all that he could to survive?All of these questions come not from the words Redford speaks because with the exception of one loudly yelled expletive there are no words. All of these thoughts and questions are written on his face, acted out for the viewer to surmise while watching. That's a difficult task for any actor and Redford steps up to the plate with his performance. As the film moves forward you root for him to make it and fear that there is no hope of his doing so. It tugs at you, wanting something good to happen to him and then feeling crushed with each new obstacle tossed his way.As for environmental concerns none are voiced here but at the same time the majesty of nature surrounds Redford and his character from start to finish. The thought that here we have a singular person in the middle of an ocean filled with life and possibly about to lose his ties into the concept that no matter what happens in this planet, nature will rule in the end. That isn't a political statement, just a fact of life.The good in this film is twofold. First there is the performance I've talked about. Secondly is the crew and the amazing work they've done here. To capture the vast ocean at its best and its worst would not be an easy task. But they've done just that, offering vistas of tremendous calm and beauty alongside the dangerous, dark storms that wreak havoc. When you discover, if you watch the extras, just how this was accomplished it makes you appreciate all the efforts that went into the production of this film.The bad about this movie is that if you don't know what to expect when you see it, and a tad even if you do, then it could be seen as incredibly boring. Like I said, no dialogue, little in the way of action as seen in most films and lots of just watching an actor attempt to convey what is going on inside his character's head doesn't make for a movie that makes you jump up now and then. Instead the slow pace means some will hate it while others will understand just what they are watching. Go in expecting it to move slow at first and not speed up much later.

I can't imgine any boatsman worth his salt liking this movie or felling any authenticity in it.Some of the glaring flaws with this movie include the captain of this vessel...1. ...calmly and unhurriedly walking around and inspecing his boat as ocean water pours into it from a large and obvious hole in the side of it - directly into the path of the boat's only method of communication. If you knew your communication equipment was likely to be ruined within the next couple of minutes, wouldn't it be smart to, y'know, call someone and let them know you are in trouble while you can still do so? Aparently not.2. ...NEVER donning a life vest. What? Your ship is floundering and may sink but you can't be troubled to put on a life vest? What are you - five years old? Even in a raging sea, you think to strap yourself to the boat with a safety line but you forget to put on a life vest and don't even think it's worth your time to bring one with you on the lifeboat? Insanity! Any half-wit would see the need for a life vest when a ship is going down.3. ...failing to apply any sun block or even bring any with him on the life boat. Is this his first time sailing? Doesn't he know the ocean is lacking in shade trees?4. ...not really comprehending how to catch a fish or the necessity of learning to do so. Again, really?! You are a boatsman who is inexperienced at catching a fish? Do you thnk you are just going to come across floating cans of food out thee in the ocean? I can't believe it.5. ...failing to seal his container of potable water. Let's face it. If you are going to be adrift on the ocean in a lifeboat for ANY period of time, you are going to need to safely protect your store of fresh water. Other than breathable air, it is the number one essential to keeping yorself alive. Not this guy, though. He ruins his store of fresh water nearly immediately.6. ...learning to navigate by using a sextant. Not generally an unbelievable feat except that he does this in a matter of hours and seems to be pretty good at it right off the bat. I refuse to believe it is THAT easy.This movie COULD have been a good movie, but there is far too much wrong with it. You know (sort of from the title, but confrmed within the first couple minutes of the movie) right from the start that this guy is going to survive. I don't care for movies that give away the ending withintthe first couple of minutes. This is just one more thing to irritate me. Even at the end of the movie, he COULD have survived if he has just worn a stupid life vest. If a guy this dumb really decided to set sail (all by himself, mind you) across the world...  well, he probably deserves to end up dead. Not that we'll ever know why he is out there by himself. The movie never explores or expands on that. The viewer is left totally in the dark about that part of this guy's story.There is just so much NOT to like about this movie. There was definitely potential for a good movie, here, but the director and screenwriters really fouled it up. I would never watch this movie a second time and would never recommend this movie to a friend or family member.",2,All is not well...,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,3926,"['When', 'look', 'praises', 'authentic', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'are', 'listed', 'front', 'product', 'case', 'have', 'roll', 'eyes', 'shake', 'head', 'ridiculousness', 'Did', 'people', 'really', 'watch', 'same', 'movie', 'did', 'possible', '34', 'AMAZING', '34', '34', 'TRIUMPH', '34', '34', 'A', 'MASTERPIECE', '34', 'are', ""n't"", 'words', 'would', 'use', 'describe', 'stinker', 'film', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'movie', 'were', 'far', 'easy', 'spot', 'pick', 'apart', 'may', 'be', 'sailor', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'accomplished', 'sailor', 'was', ""n't"", 'point', 'was', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'role', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'can', 'act', 'well', 'enough', 'director', 'must', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'topic', 'either', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imgine', 'boatsman', 'worth', 'salt', 'liking', 'movie', 'felling', 'authenticity', 'it.Some', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'movie', 'include', 'captain', 'vessel', '1', 'calmly', 'unhurriedly', 'walking', 'around', 'inspecing', 'boat', 'ocean', 'water', 'pours', 'large', 'obvious', 'hole', 'side', 'directly', 'path', 'boat', 'only', 'method', 'communication', 'knew', 'communication', 'equipment', 'was', 'likely', 'be', 'ruined', 'next', 'couple', 'minutes', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'smart', ""y'know"", 'call', 'someone', 'let', 'know', 'are', 'trouble', 'can', 'still', 'do', 'so', 'Aparently', 'not.2', 'NEVER', 'donning', 'life', 'vest', 'What', 'ship', 'floundering', 'may', 'sink', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'troubled', 'put', 'life', 'vest', 'What', 'are', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'Even', 'raging', 'sea', 'think', 'strap', 'boat', 'safety', 'line', 'forget', 'put', 'life', 'vest', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'time', 'bring', 'one', 'lifeboat', 'Insanity', 'half-wit', 'would', 'see', 'need', 'life', 'vest', 'when', 'ship', 'going', 'down.3', 'failing', 'apply', 'sun', 'block', 'even', 'bring', 'life', 'boat', 'first', 'time', 'sailing', ""n't"", 'know', 'ocean', 'lacking', 'shade', 'trees', '4', 'not', 'really', 'comprehending', 'how', 'catch', 'fish', 'necessity', 'learning', 'do', 'so', 'Again', 'really', 'are', 'boatsman', 'who', 'inexperienced', 'catching', 'fish', 'Do', 'thnk', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'come', 'floating', 'cans', 'food', 'thee', 'ocean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'it.5', 'failing', 'seal', 'container', 'potable', 'water', 'Let', 'face', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'adrift', 'ocean', 'lifeboat', 'ANY', 'period', 'time', 'are', 'going', 'need', 'safely', 'protect', 'store', 'fresh', 'water', 'Other', 'breathable', 'air', 'number', 'one', 'essential', 'keeping', 'alive', 'Not', 'guy', 'though', 'store', 'fresh', 'water', 'nearly', 'immediately.6', 'learning', 'navigate', 'using', 'sextant', 'Not', 'generally', 'unbelievable', 'feat', 'matter', 'hours', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'refuse', 'believe', 'easy.This', 'movie', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'know', 'sort', 'title', 'confrmed', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'movie', 'right', 'start', 'guy', 'going', 'survive', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movies', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'withintthe', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'irritate', 'Even', 'end', 'movie', 'COULD', 'have', 'survived', 'just', 'worn', 'stupid', 'life', 'vest', 'guy', 'really', 'decided', 'set', 'sail', 'world', 'well', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'Not', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'know', 'why', 'there', 'movie', 'never', 'viewer', 'left', 'totally', 'dark', 'part', 'guy', 'story.There', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'NOT', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'potential', 'good', 'movie', 'here', 'director', 'screenwriters', 'really', 'fouled', 'up', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'would', 'never', 'recommend', 'movie', 'friend', 'family', 'member']",N/A

Simple answer: they've been fed so much fastfood big budget wowing special effects junk films that are just loud noise and excessive glitter keeping the mind occupied with nothing more than useless matter. Gone are the glorious films that stand out, with character and dignity. Well-written screenplays are rare, the majority are long extinct. So it is a rare occasion that a film comes out that is really worth paying the money to see. Watching this, a movie that dares to have practically no dialogue, and absolute focus on its star - that my friends is something you will see only once, and this is the movie.

This is a behavior I&#8217;ve never understood. And having watched &#8221;All is Lost&#8221; I can now say that my intuitions are thoroughly vindicated. This is a harrowing film to watch, the most claustrophobic, confining film that I&#8217;ve seen since the under-rated &#8220;Buried&#8221; (a film that takes place entirely in a coffin; see my review here). In this case, the coffin is replaced by a medium sized skiff. The sailor (he is never named) wakes from slumber and realizes things have taken a turn for the worst. The film follows the sailor over the next week as his world begins to shrink and life becomes increasingly perilous.The sailor is played by Robert Redford in a bravura performance that would surely have been celebrated in most any year. (I&#8217;m tempted to say Redford&#8217;s was a bravura performance for a man his age. And so it is. But the demands of this film would test the mettle of most any actor, of that I&#8217;m sure.) Alas, 2013 was an outstanding year for film, and it seems that &#8220;All is Lost&#8221; never quite garnered the spotlight it well deserved. Riveting, with a script that consists of no more than one paragraph of dialogue in the whole film. (A lesser film might have tacked on a voice over narration. Thank goodness &#8220;All is Lost&#8221; isn&#8217;t a lesser film.)Is all really lost? Does the sailor go down with his ship? Or does he live to a see another day? Once again, a lesser film would have tied up loose ends. But &#8220;All is Lost&#8221; ends in a delicious and well deserved ambiguity. If the sailor at sea is a metaphor for life &#8212; and why not? &#8212; then the ambiguity is but one more nod to the human predicament itself. In that sense we&#8217;re all at sea. Is all lost?

As the gaping hole sends a plethora of ocean brine into his luxurious boat our hero scrambles to minimize the damage.Using resourceful tools our hero tries to mend the hole and right the ship to shore.  However Mother Nature does not cooperate as a storm at sea makes for a battle of wits with the ocean in which Mother Nature prevails and sends the luxurious sailboat to Davey Jones Locker.Succumbing to the disaster, our hero uses the resources to his last resort of an inflatable lifeboat in which he tries to drift with the aid of a sextant to a major Pacific shipping lane where he hopes to be sited and rescued.  Much like Hemingway&#8217;s Santiago we follow our hero&#8217;s exploits of lack of water and food in order to seek his rescue whereas Santiago struggles to bring in his marlin whole.

1681314,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00GST8U4U,The People's Critic,"[0, 0]","In the early 20th century, a literary movement known as Naturalism caught on as war suddenly began to grip America once again.  Influenced by the work of Charles Darwin, Naturalistic writers wanted to emphasize the dark, harshness of life as well as man&#8217;s lack of control of the natural forces that truly guide his fate.  All is Lost is as close to cinematic Naturalism as I&#8217;ve ever seen.Robert Redford plays a character whose name is never revealed, a typical trait of Naturalism as these forms of expression look to stress nature&#8217;s indifference to man. This indifference is further exemplified with the film&#8217;s opening scene where the man (Redford) awakens from a nap below deck on his sailboat to find that a stray floating cargo container had somehow drifted into the side of his boat, puncturing it and resulting in the boat quickly taking on water.  No explanation is given for this circumstance or than that it presumably fell off of a cargo ship and, as fate would have it, collided with the boat.  The man is a pensive man; he does not react wildly or make rash decisions, rather he weighs his options and relies on his experience and skills.  Redford&#8217;s is the only character in the entire film, and he is also a man of few words; accordingly, the script for All is Lost is only 32 pages long.  Thus, writer/director J.C. Chandor&#8217;s film looks to explore modern Naturalism at sea as deliberately as possible.All is Lost is a riveting achievement.  As we watch this man struggle through a series of events set into motion by that seemingly innocuous cargo container, we are forced to mull over our own mortality and our own suitability to circumstance.  Last year, Ang Lee&#8217;s adaptation of Life of Pi beautifully captured some of what All is Lost attempted to capture, but that film was far more Romantic in its aspirations.  All is Lost instead puts plot aside and seeks to pit man against nature in a rigorous, albeit somewhat predictable series of events.  The result is a compelling yet extraordinarily minimalistic effort that does feel redundant at times.Earlier this year, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n&#8217;s Gravity also pitted man against incredible odds in a far more successful way.  While both films depict man&#8217;s struggle with expertise, Cuar&oacute;n, like Ang Lee before him, understood the need to make the film a visual spectacle as well.  Thus, those films certainly utilize the media of film far more than All is Lost, while All is Lost relies more on Redford.  Fortunately, Redford delivers.

1681315,A1Y2GZGBMICFG8,B00GST8U4U,The Separator,"[1, 2]","Another film about the human spirit&#8217;s ability to persevere we do not need, yet here we are again.In the straights on Sumatra off the coast of Indonesia a lone sailor (Robert Redford) awakens to find his sailboat's cabin filling fast with sea water. A massive whole has been torn through the side after a freak, overnight collision with a rogue shipping container. In the vastness of the Indian Ocean the spectacular odds of this collision&#8217;s happening seem staggering, and yet this is only the beginning of the misadventure.After patching up the side of the boat, even despite the total loss of all modern navigation equipment, the danger seems to cease. For a moment it seems like all that&#8217;s left is for the lone sailor to venture into the nearest port and seek repairs, but of course we know this is not the story.It is as if the hulking metal mass has delivered upon the lone sailor a divine wrath from which there is no escape. When we see the container, a faceless representation of some mega conglomerate, smashed through the side of the delicate sailboat, sweatshop-produced shoes spilling out into the ocean, the irony is overwhelming. The very world the lone sailor has set out to get away from has tracked him down.Before we start the film, just from the title alone, we know what the outcome will be, yet despite the unoriginal plot and standard shipwreck story conventions, the film succeeds. Fantastically succeeds.Almost completely devoid of dialogue, Robert Redford exudes a stolid, matter-of-fact persona in the face of catastrophe. He toils steadily, remaining steadfast in his manner. It is exhausting just watching him labor endlessly and even though he is performing, this performance cannot really be considered acting. Simply going through the motions of this role is enough to exude awe, especially when he is being thrown around wildly by the untamed, open ocean; the work that it must have taken to play this role is obvious and seems to strip away acting practices; what we really see is a man just trying not to die.9/10Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",5,"Unoriginal concept, excellently executed",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2102,"['film', 'human', 'spirit', '8217', 'ability', 'persevere', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'yet', 'here', 'are', 'again.In', 'straights', 'Sumatra', 'coast', 'Indonesia', 'lone', 'sailor', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'find', 'sailboat', 'cabin', 'filling', 'fast', 'sea', 'water', 'massive', 'whole', 'been', 'torn', 'side', 'freak', 'overnight', 'collision', 'rogue', 'shipping', 'container', 'vastness', 'Indian', 'Ocean', 'spectacular', 'odds', 'collision', '8217', 'happening', 'seem', 'staggering', 'yet', 'only', 'beginning', 'misadventure.After', 'patching', 'up', 'side', 'boat', 'even', 'total', 'loss', 'modern', 'navigation', 'equipment', 'danger', 'cease', 'moment', '8217', 's', 'left', 'lone', 'sailor', 'venture', 'nearest', 'port', 'seek', 'repairs', 'course', 'know', 'not', 'story.It', 'hulking', 'metal', 'mass', 'delivered', 'lone', 'sailor', 'divine', 'wrath', 'escape', 'When', 'see', 'container', 'faceless', 'representation', 'mega', 'conglomerate', 'smashed', 'side', 'delicate', 'sailboat', 'sweatshop-produced', 'shoes', 'spilling', 'out', 'ocean', 'irony', 'overwhelming', 'very', 'world', 'lone', 'sailor', 'set', 'out', 'get', 'away', 'tracked', 'down.Before', 'start', 'film', 'just', 'title', 'alone', 'know', 'what', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', 'yet', 'unoriginal', 'plot', 'standard', 'shipwreck', 'story', 'conventions', 'film', 'Fantastically', 'succeeds.Almost', 'completely', 'devoid', 'dialogue', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'stolid', 'matter-of-fact', 'persona', 'face', 'catastrophe', 'steadily', 'remaining', 'steadfast', 'manner', 'exhausting', 'just', 'watching', 'labor', 'endlessly', 'even', 'performing', 'performance', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'considered', 'acting', 'Simply', 'going', 'motions', 'role', 'enough', 'exude', 'awe', 'especially', 'when', 'being', 'thrown', 'wildly', 'untamed', 'open', 'ocean', 'work', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'play', 'role', 'obvious', 'strip', 'away', 'acting', 'practices', 'what', 'really', 'see', 'man', 'just', 'trying', 'not', 'die.9/10Get', 'more', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",N/A

I was let down by that expectation. I will however say that this movie really shows what a great actor Robert Redford is. Movies like Cast Away and Gravity while mainly about someone being alone did have other people in it and had a back story for the person. This one ONLY had Robert Redford and it starts as soon as he hits the tanker. No back story or anything about the character. There is also a total of about 20 words in the movie. All that said by the end you are really rooting for the guy and hope someone finds him. That is the sign of a great actor, being able to make people root for you and feel emotions without words. As good as he was in this though the movie isn't for everyone. It really is just watching someone trying to stay alive in the ocean alone for over an hour and a half.

Chandor has gone far afield in his second feature and he should be applauded for tackling a subject so different from his first one, Margin Call--about the 2008 financial world implosion. Here it's minimalism at its best, Robert Redford all alone in a sailboat on the Indian Ocean, with virtually no dialogue throughout the film. It begins with Redford's unnamed character (referred to 'Our Man' in the credits) reading his epitaph in a voice-over narration. Flashback eight days earlier and we see how this intrepid sailor ended up in so much trouble: a shipping container somehow has landed plump in the middle of the sea, and rams his tiny sailboat, causing the cabin to fill with water. As a result, all his high-tech equipment is ruined and he's forced to be creative with makeshift repairs.The first half of the film focuses on the sailor's efforts to keep his boat upright. What keeps our interest is the various ways in which he goes about surviving: stockpiling rations, emptying the hold of water and climbing up the mast to secure the sails. The sailor also comes up with an ingenious way of collecting rain water. Then there's a tremendous storm and the boat is turned upside down and then righted again.The second half of the film revolves the sailor's actions after he's forced to abandon ship. All that's left is his tiny inflatable raft, which he's mercilessly tossed around in, during a second storm. There's also an obligatory scene with sharks surrounding the small craft and passing giant ships, which fail to spot the hapless sailor, as he fires flares into the sky.In reading some posts on the internet, those who have sailing experience indicated that the depiction of the sailor's skills in attempting to save the ship lacked authenticity (for example, the flimsy patching job would not have held out in that kind of sea). As someone with no background in the area, I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of simply being entertained. I did take issue with the film's ending, where the sailor dives into the water and sinks toward the bottom, in an apparent suicide try. He did seem awfully deep before he saw the other boat and could be rescued and I wonder if he could so easily have held his breath that long and was able to swim back up, where he was pulled to safety.Nonetheless, most of 'All is Lost' will keep your interest to the end. Redford's performance is admirable given that he did most of the stunts. I look forward to Mr. Chandor's next film since he has proved that he's capable of applying the old adage, 'variety is the spice of life', to his film career, which is certainly a good thing indeed!",3,"Redford impresses as cast away sailor, doing most of his own stunts",1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,2716,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '3.5', '5.0J.C', 'Chandor', 'gone', 'far', 'afield', 'second', 'feature', 'should', 'be', 'applauded', 'tackling', 'subject', 'so', 'different', 'first', 'one', 'Margin', 'Call', '2008', 'financial', 'world', 'implosion', 'Here', 'minimalism', 'best', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'alone', 'sailboat', 'Indian', 'Ocean', 'virtually', 'dialogue', 'film', 'Redford', 'unnamed', 'character', 'referred', ""'Our"", 'Man', 'credits', 'reading', 'epitaph', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'Flashback', 'eight', 'days', 'earlier', 'see', 'how', 'intrepid', 'sailor', 'ended', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'shipping', 'container', 'somehow', 'landed', 'plump', 'middle', 'sea', 'rams', 'tiny', 'sailboat', 'causing', 'cabin', 'fill', 'water', 'result', 'high-tech', 'equipment', 'ruined', 'forced', 'be', 'creative', 'makeshift', 'repairs.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'sailor', 'efforts', 'keep', 'boat', 'upright', 'What', 'interest', 'various', 'ways', 'surviving', 'stockpiling', 'rations', 'emptying', 'hold', 'water', 'climbing', 'up', 'mast', 'secure', 'sails', 'sailor', 'also', 'up', 'ingenious', 'way', 'collecting', 'rain', 'water', 'Then', 'tremendous', 'storm', 'boat', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'then', 'righted', 'again.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'sailor', 'actions', 'forced', 'abandon', 'ship', 'left', 'tiny', 'inflatable', 'raft', 'mercilessly', 'tossed', 'second', 'storm', 'also', 'obligatory', 'scene', 'sharks', 'surrounding', 'small', 'craft', 'passing', 'giant', 'ships', 'fail', 'spot', 'hapless', 'sailor', 'sky.In', 'reading', 'posts', 'internet', 'who', 'have', 'sailing', 'experience', 'indicated', 'depiction', 'sailor', 'skills', 'attempting', 'save', 'ship', 'lacked', 'authenticity', 'example', 'flimsy', 'patching', 'job', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'held', 'out', 'kind', 'sea', 'someone', 'background', 'area', 'was', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'sake', 'simply', 'being', 'entertained', 'did', 'take', 'issue', 'film', 'ending', 'where', 'sailor', 'water', 'sinks', 'bottom', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'try', 'did', 'seem', 'awfully', 'deep', 'saw', 'other', 'boat', 'could', 'be', 'rescued', 'wonder', 'could', 'so', 'easily', 'have', 'held', 'breath', 'long', 'was', 'able', 'swim', 'back', 'up', 'where', 'was', 'pulled', 'safety.Nonetheless', 'most', ""'All"", 'Lost', 'will', 'keep', 'interest', 'end', 'Redford', 'performance', 'admirable', 'given', 'did', 'most', 'stunts', 'look', 'forward', 'Mr.', 'Chandor', 'next', 'film', 'proved', 'capable', 'applying', 'old', 'adage', ""'variety"", 'spice', 'life', 'film', 'career', 'certainly', 'good', 'thing', 'indeed']",N/A

All is Lost entails, perhaps, the most classical elements of filmmaking and storytelling by relying on sound, atmosphere, and visuals to accompany you along the journey than voice.All is Lost tells the story of a lonely man at sea chronicling his tough journey as he tries to survive through treacherous tidal waves, storms, rain, and broken parts of his vessel. Robert Redford, who is our main and only character in the film, is ferociously compelling as your average man finding tranquility while boating.His performance reminds me a lot of what silent film stars would do allowing movement and emotions tell you what is going on and how he feels more than saying something. But the little to no dialogue and atmospheric intensity is not just a plus point, the film's aim to be straightforward and detailed about the perils and horror of boating gone wrong makes not only for compelling viewing but an emotional catharsis on the filmmakers' part to let the audience know that with flexibility, courage, and stamina can one survive such harsh circumstances.It is timeless without it meaning to be and the lost-at-sea concept in the film is put to good use without it being preachy or over-the-top on occasion like 127 Hours, or for that matter, commercialized like Cast Away. The main problems with the film regardless would most likely have to do with the audience perception and how many will find this boring, the use of fade ins-and-outs and extensive long shots to make you think it will end or not, and Redford's unnamed character saying almost nothing other than radio call signals and a curse word. Most people, even if lonely, will not go as far as to say almost nothing- they may otherwise hum, sing, or tell their self a funny limerick. Sorry but it seemed a bit far-fetched but I find it excepting moreover.Nonetheless, I still urge you to consider All is Lost as a determining and intense film to go see in a time where many of the Oscar-nominated films are worth of praise but nothing short of just being bait and usually predictable by what they present- whether it be drama or a historical piece.&#34;",4,Powerful and timeless yet tough and upsetting survival drama that shows how versatile Redford can be.,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,2232,"['34', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'likely', 'upsetting', 'survivalist', 'dramas', 'have', 'seen', 'lately', '127', 'Hours', 'Lost', 'entails', 'perhaps', 'most', 'classical', 'elements', 'filmmaking', 'storytelling', 'relying', 'sound', 'atmosphere', 'visuals', 'accompany', 'journey', 'voice.All', 'Lost', 'tells', 'story', 'lonely', 'man', 'sea', 'chronicling', 'tough', 'journey', 'survive', 'treacherous', 'tidal', 'waves', 'storms', 'rain', 'broken', 'parts', 'vessel', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'main', 'only', 'character', 'film', 'ferociously', 'compelling', 'average', 'man', 'finding', 'tranquility', 'boating.His', 'performance', 'lot', 'what', 'silent', 'film', 'stars', 'would', 'do', 'allowing', 'movement', 'emotions', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'how', 'more', 'saying', 'something', 'little', 'dialogue', 'atmospheric', 'intensity', 'not', 'just', 'plus', 'point', 'film', 'aim', 'be', 'straightforward', 'detailed', 'perils', 'horror', 'boating', 'gone', 'wrong', 'not', 'only', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'emotional', 'catharsis', 'filmmakers', 'part', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'flexibility', 'courage', 'stamina', 'can', 'one', 'survive', 'such', 'harsh', 'circumstances.It', 'timeless', 'meaning', 'be', 'lost-at-sea', 'concept', 'film', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'being', 'preachy', 'over-the-top', 'occasion', '127', 'Hours', 'matter', 'commercialized', 'Cast', 'Away', 'main', 'problems', 'film', 'regardless', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'do', 'audience', 'perception', 'how', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'boring', 'use', 'fade', 'ins-and-outs', 'extensive', 'long', 'shots', 'make', 'think', 'will', 'end', 'not', 'Redford', 'unnamed', 'character', 'saying', 'almost', 'nothing', 'other', 'radio', 'call', 'signals', 'curse', 'word', 'Most', 'people', 'even', 'lonely', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'almost', 'nothing-', 'may', 'otherwise', 'hum', 'sing', 'tell', 'self', 'funny', 'limerick', 'Sorry', 'seemed', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'find', 'excepting', 'moreover.Nonetheless', 'still', 'urge', 'consider', 'Lost', 'determining', 'intense', 'film', 'go', 'see', 'time', 'where', 'many', 'Oscar-nominated', 'films', 'are', 'worth', 'praise', 'nothing', 'short', 'just', 'being', 'bait', 'usually', 'predictable', 'what', 'present-', 'be', 'drama', 'historical', 'piece.', '34']",N/A
