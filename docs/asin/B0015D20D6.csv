The ending was a welcome surprise that more than made up for it though. Jonathan Shcech is more than exercising his acting chops. Seems he has decided to become a character actor instead of a ""pretty face"" who can act. Job well done. The relationship between Schech's character Bo and his brother Peboan was touching and done very well. One of the things I love about low budget ""regional"" films like this is they tend to concentrate on the characters more than the action, murders and sometimes even the story. Several characters were sympathetic, like Bo's best friend and the hooker , who fell for Peboan. Some of the stroy is a redo, but it was done very well. But the ending made up for any deficiencies. I really give it a 3.5 stars. Worth the money.",3,Not Just For Cajuns,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,819,"['only', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'predictable', 'ending', 'was', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'Jonathan', 'Shcech', 'more', 'exercising', 'acting', 'chops', 'decided', 'become', 'character', 'actor', 'instead', 'pretty', 'face', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'Job', 'well', 'done', 'relationship', 'Schech', 'character', 'Bo', 'brother', 'Peboan', 'was', 'touching', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'One', 'things', 'love', 'low', 'budget', 'regional', 'films', 'tend', 'concentrate', 'characters', 'more', 'action', 'murders', 'sometimes', 'even', 'story', 'Several', 'characters', 'were', 'sympathetic', 'Bo', 'best', 'friend', 'hooker', 'who', 'fell', 'Peboan', 'stroy', 'redo', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'ending', 'made', 'up', 'deficiencies', 'really', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'money']",Little Chenier: A Cajun Story

1149251,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B0015D20D6,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[21, 25]","It is not often that a high quality film production comes through the Cajun country to capture the scenery and locale so eloquently. Filming locations were around Little Chenier and numerous parishes surrounding. The absence of destruction is because the film was made just prior to Hurricane Rita. There is no link for the Blu Ray title of this so I will mention it briefly.The Blu looks incredible for the scenery and vegetation captures. Every time a boat goes through the water channels everything looks so flawless. No special features are included and the sound was mixed down to 2.0. The DVD is worth the purchase for local fans though.The story is quite simple yet manages to convey a sense of importance for the players involved. A tale of love, betrayal, tragic death and intertwined stories while the simple life passes by in the Cajun country. Two brothers ebb their existence by selling fish bait from their small dock, whilst being watched by the local sheriff for crimes they may or may not have committed. Their best friend, played by Clifton Collins (who is awesome in Dirty - a must see for fans of his) adds the slightly comedic element and semi-protector of the group. Lines are crossed, beautiful topography imagery is interlaced, and locals get their 15 minutes. Performances are forced and the accents slip quite often, but the background is what holds it together.If you live outside the filming area, this film would still be worth the watch just for the scenery. The DVD has a few deleted scenes and a drastically different alternate ending. Another selling point would have to be the music options. They have transferable songs from the DVD and extra cuts from other artists for download to your computer. The movie is listed online as 120 minutes, but the running time is 100 (110 with deleted) so not sure what was cut.Be sure to watch the pics of where they filmed immediately followed by a shot of the after effects of Rita - heartbreaking (just prior to credits). Speaking of credits, they are very detailed - and more representative of filming spots than I have seen in any other listings. I wish all films were that precise, kudos to the locals who got their boats and homes listed by name.",3,Blu/DVD review of a Cajun artwork...,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2224,"['not', 'often', 'high', 'quality', 'film', 'production', 'Cajun', 'country', 'capture', 'scenery', 'locale', 'so', 'eloquently', 'Filming', 'locations', 'were', 'around', 'Little', 'Chenier', 'numerous', 'parishes', 'surrounding', 'absence', 'destruction', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'prior', 'Hurricane', 'Rita', 'link', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'title', 'so', 'will', 'mention', 'briefly.The', 'Blu', 'incredible', 'scenery', 'vegetation', 'captures', 'time', 'boat', 'water', 'channels', 'everything', 'so', 'flawless', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'sound', 'was', 'mixed', 'down', '2.0', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'local', 'fans', 'though.The', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'yet', 'convey', 'sense', 'importance', 'players', 'involved', 'tale', 'love', 'betrayal', 'tragic', 'death', 'intertwined', 'stories', 'simple', 'life', 'passes', 'Cajun', 'country', 'Two', 'brothers', 'ebb', 'existence', 'selling', 'fish', 'bait', 'small', 'dock', 'whilst', 'being', 'watched', 'local', 'sheriff', 'crimes', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'committed', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'who', 'awesome', 'Dirty', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'slightly', 'comedic', 'element', 'semi-protector', 'group', 'Lines', 'are', 'crossed', 'beautiful', 'topography', 'imagery', 'interlaced', 'locals', 'get', '15', 'minutes', 'Performances', 'are', 'forced', 'accents', 'slip', 'quite', 'often', 'background', 'what', 'live', 'filming', 'area', 'film', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'watch', 'just', 'scenery', 'DVD', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'drastically', 'different', 'alternate', 'ending', 'selling', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'music', 'options', 'have', 'transferable', 'songs', 'DVD', 'extra', 'cuts', 'other', 'artists', 'download', 'computer', 'movie', 'listed', 'online', '120', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', '100', '110', 'deleted', 'so', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'cut.Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'pics', 'where', 'filmed', 'immediately', 'followed', 'shot', 'effects', 'Rita', 'heartbreaking', 'just', 'prior', 'credits', 'Speaking', 'credits', 'are', 'very', 'detailed', 'more', 'representative', 'filming', 'spots', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'listings', 'wish', 'films', 'were', 'precise', 'kudos', 'locals', 'who', 'got', 'boats', 'homes', 'listed', 'name']",Little Chenier: A Cajun Story
