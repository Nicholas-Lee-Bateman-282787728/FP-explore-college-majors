1164480,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B0019N8P2W,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]","Watching these incredible Daria episodes has brought back some wonderful memories for me. I was in 8th grade when this show debuted on MTV in Spring '97. Daria is sarcastic, anti-social and 100% real - there is nothing fake about this clever high school gal. Daria was the perfect role model, she was smart, strangely beautiful, and insecure but had enought sass to back up her imperfections. Some of my favorite episodes include: Too Cute, Road Worrier, Pierce Me, Jake of Hearts, Jane's Addition, I Loathe a Parade, Fire!, My Night at Daria's, and Boxing Daria. Also included in this 8-disc set are the 2 Daria movies, Is It Fall Yet? and Is It College Yet? I love Daria, she puts a smile on my face even though she rarely smiles herself. I also love when Daria blushes when she is around her unrequited crush, Trent and her first love, Tom - so sweet because Daria is not the kind of girl who likes to wear her heart on her sleeve. Yes, the music is changed but that didn't stop me from enjoying these fabulous episodes. I highly recommend this childhood favorite, get your copy today!",5,My dear sweet Daria.,1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,1088,"['Watching', 'incredible', 'Daria', 'episodes', 'brought', 'back', 'wonderful', 'memories', 'was', '8th', 'grade', 'when', 'show', 'debuted', 'MTV', 'Spring', ""'97"", 'Daria', 'sarcastic', 'anti-social', '100', '%', 'real', 'nothing', 'fake', 'clever', 'high', 'school', 'gal', 'Daria', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'model', 'was', 'smart', 'strangely', 'beautiful', 'insecure', 'had', 'enought', 'sass', 'back', 'up', 'imperfections', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'include', 'Too', 'Cute', 'Road', 'Worrier', 'Pierce', 'Me', 'Jake', 'Hearts', 'Jane', 'Addition', 'Loathe', 'Parade', 'Fire', 'Night', 'Daria', 'Boxing', 'Daria', 'Also', 'included', '8-disc', 'set', 'are', '2', 'Daria', 'movies', 'Fall', 'College', 'Yet', 'love', 'Daria', 'smile', 'face', 'even', 'rarely', 'also', 'love', 'when', 'Daria', 'when', 'unrequited', 'crush', 'Trent', 'first', 'love', 'Tom', 'so', 'sweet', 'Daria', 'not', 'kind', 'girl', 'who', 'wear', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'Yes', 'music', 'changed', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'fabulous', 'episodes', 'highly', 'recommend', 'childhood', 'favorite', 'get', 'copy', 'today']",Daria: The Complete Animated Series

1164490,ANQDMB1WUCEPK,B0019N8P2W,anothvortex,"[4, 5]","Well, when I heard about this box set, I made it a point to order one with my next available paycheck. After waiting nearly a decade for these episodes, I wasted no time in beginning a marathon of viewing that allowed me to burn through the products content within a week. Now maybe I can catch up on my sleep just a bit -_-;;;All in all, I was very happy with the DVDs. When I originally saw the majority of the Daria series, it was the watered down versions produced by the N network. Watching these new and (mostly) unedited episodes gave me a much more fulfilling experience than before. Old and familiar favorites were present alongside stories I had never even heard of. All in all, it was an awesome feeling of nostalgia.The extra features were fairly good too. The Daria Day Intro's were collectively excellent. In all honesty, I was disappointed that more episodes did not include them. The movies were everything I hoped for, while the interviews were refreshing. The remaining extras, however, such as the character profiles ended a little weak.Now there is one thing that anyone involved with this product has to already understand and that is the issue of music. I have to admit that, upon initially discovering this change, I was not very worried. I enjoyed the series for its timeless writing and awesome animation. In fact, by removing the music the episodes are not as defined by a particular time period and will probably relate better with new converts. However, as the series progresses, I have to admit that the change in music is more and more obvious. In fact, secondary noises were sometimes improperly re-dubbed bringing more attention to the change.Still, despite some mild weaknesses, I highly recommend this box set for both old fans and those completely unaware of it before. Daria relates to all those who were just a little different, awkward, or out of place in their High School experience.

1164496,A3CA3RWZYJDWXE,B0019N8P2W,BJ Fraser,"[0, 0]","I hadn't seen this show in nearly a decade, but thanks to the magic of DVDs (and Amazon's Gold Box special) I got the chance to relive some memories of the late 90s when this show first aired.What's especially interesting is that this began in 1997, so it's just before every high school kid had a cell phone, iPod, and so on. It of course also predates MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and other ""social networks."" So by that token, it actually reflects a simpler time, when kids actually still walked down hallways and spoke to each other without using a phone.The series revolves (as you'd probably guess) around a girl named Daria Morgandorffer, who was previous seen every so often on MTV's ""Beavis and Butthead."" Only now Daria has moved to suburban Lawndale with her workaholic mom Helen, nutty father Jake, and too-perfect sister Quinn. As in any show or movie about high school, Daria is an outcast not because of any physical deformity, but because she has dark hair, glasses, and a working brain. Throughout the show's five seasons, Daria and her new artist friend Jane poke fun at high school life with its quest for popularity. Though she thinks she knows it all, Daria does sometimes still get schooled, especially once Tom enters the picture in the 4th season.Actually the relationship with Tom was something I didn't really buy into. He's the type of guy who seems just a little too perfect, especially for an outcast like her. Mostly I think the producers just wanted to try and breathe some new life into the show, but it didn't really work for me. It was also convenient that by that point her crush on Jane's brother Trent had been completely forgotten, like the lost brother on ""Happy Days."" By the end of the 5th season it did seem like the show was kind of jumping the shark, though maybe now it's time for a big screen reboot or something. Actually I'm sure if Daria were in high school today, she'd have a lot more fodder for wry observations.Much has been made about having to get rid of the music used in the series when it first aired because of the licensing fees. I really don't remember the show that well that I could remember what songs were used in the first place, so it didn't bother me much. Although in the paintball one, didn't they use Barber's ""Adagio for Strings?"" That's one I do remember, or think I do. I would have thought by now that would have passed into public domain, but maybe not.Anyway, my favorite episode has always been the one where Daria's English teacher the wimpy Mr. O'Neil challenges her to write a story that involves a deck of cards.

I was convinced that Daria was lost forever.Okay, actually I didn't really think about Daria until I heard about this set. Then I remembered how much I loved the show and I decided to pick it up. Daria was the girl I always wanted to be when I was in high school - her own person, and willing to have no friends rather than bad friends. I was a bit less self-assured as a teenager, but Daria was my hero.And now I get to relive it all! All five seasons are in this set, as well as the two movies - though watching them, they come off more like extra-long episodes, which I thought was great. The second movie, ""Is It College Yet?"" gives a very nice ending to the series with great opportunities for Daria and Jane.As some people may have heard: no, the original music is not in this set. Now, I don't remember much of the original music, aside from the opening theme song - and thank god they kept that - so it doesn't bother me too much. Even if you didn't read the insert (the full explanation is there) you can kinda tell when you watch it. The music just has a more contemporary feel to it, while the show itself is very nineties.

All 66 episodes and the two movies look very good.  Colors are vibrant and although not the most detailed animated series, ""Daria"" manages to capture this look that was quite unique for an animated series and worked perfectly.  I detected no blurring, no interlacing or major compression artifacting.Only the pilot episode is presented in black and white (the pilot is not fully animated or colored).AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Daria - The Complete Animated Series"" is presented in Dolby Digital.  Dialogue and music is clear and understandable.  It is important to note that there is an insert featuring show creator Glenn Eichler explaining how 99% of the music (fortunately not the intro. song) were changed for this DVD release.  Reason is because of the cost of licensing and the many bites used would have made it impossible to release the Daria animated collection.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Daria - The Complete Animated Series"" comes with the following special features on disc 8:* Daria Movie - Is it Fall Yet? - (1:12:18) It's summer vacation, what will the students of Lawndale High do over the summer?* Daria Movie - Is it College Yet? - (1:05:58) Daria must choose which college to go and worries about her relationship with Tom.* Character Profiles - The following feature allows viewers to obtain a profile of each character of the ""Daria"" animated TV show universe and also see the original character sketches for that character.* Pilot - Sealed with a Kick - (5:24) The original first episode pilot (black and white, not fully animated or colored but features the vocals).* Music Video - Freakin' Friends - (2:38) An animated Mystik Spiral music video.* Daria and Jane Top Ten Countdown - (5:52) Daria and Jane host the MTV's animated videos top 10 countdown.* Pilot Script for Spinoff ""Mystik Spiral"" - Included is the script for the pilot ""Mystik Spiral"" (via PDF included as a DVD-Rom).* Cast Interviews - (6:21) Featuring interviews with the co-creators and the voice talent.  Creators talk about how the series came to fruition and the writers talk about developing the series while the voice talent talk about the popularity of the show.JUDGMENT CALL:""Daria"" is definitely a big part of American pop culture from the '90s leading up to the early 2000's.  Where most teen drama, especially on cable are all live, at the time, it was great to have a series with a character who was a misanthrope and a protagonist that wasn't super rich, absorbed in material things and pretty much, the series spoke to a lot of people.So, in many ways, ""Daria - The Complete Animated Series"" is a release that many people are going to buy and enjoy.  I know there are some people who have a problem with music being replaced but the fact is, ""Daria"" is not the first, it's happening to a lot of series and it has been so bad to the point that many series have not been released on DVD.  Licensing for music on DVD's have become too expensive and a lot of the shows that we enjoyed are having to dump the music out or the series is not being released at all.The good news is that unlike its predecessor ""Beavis & Butthead"" and unlike other television shows that utilized popular mainstream music, ""Daria"" had music but it was not the focal point of the series.  Aside from the main opening theme which is included on the episodes in this collection, it was the characters and the storylines that stood out for ""Daria"" and so, I can easily say that ""Daria - The Complete Animated Series"" is just as enjoyable without the original music.Overall, his is a wonderful set and I really believe that fans will enjoy this release.  All 66 episodes (inc. the pilot), two films and special features and the episodes look very good on DVD.  If you are a fan of ""Daria"", then I highly recommend ""Daria - The Complete Animated Series""!",5,I have one word to describe this DVD set...

1164513,A105D0UKK3356E,B0019N8P2W,Dunestar,"[1, 1]","Before I begin this review, yes, Glenn Eichler does put in a disclaimer about why the DVD Collection had changed all the music sound bites.  Mainly due to the fact although MTV never had a problem with using them on their network, whenever you attempt to put it on another medium, you end up dealing with outrageous licensing issues.Bottom line, it makes it impossible to release the collection because one would have to sell it at about $500 or so, not to mention getting approval by the artists themselves.  By that time, you'd never get the aforementioned item in a collection such as this.  (Probably why we'll never see the Gamera episodes of MST3K on DVD.. ah, well).But enough grousing about insignificant details, let's get onto the collection itself.First off, it's amazing something spun-off from Mike Judge's ""Beavis & Butthead,"" genuinely became an animated cult-classic.  Essentially because at the time, Daria was simply a passing character, attempting to be the voice of reason for these guys.  Whereas here, she's pretty much a realistic teen dealing with the nonsense which makes up high-school life.""Daria"" has a refreshing spin when you watch it because it doesn't follow the typical 'teen' mould of animation.  No angst, no emotional nonsense, no 'brainless' adults, just a person dealing with the realistic (?) view of teenage life.  Back in the late 90's, thanks to shows like ""Saved by the Bell,"" ""Galaxy High,"" and other teen-based shows out there, basically you had the youth coming up like intelligent know-it-alls, while the grown-ups were usually portrayed as clueless adults.  Whereas with Daria, usually the problem with adults, was they were too absorbed with their agendas, or being too condescending.Unlike other shows, Daria's parents usually knew what was going on at times, even though sometimes her sister, Quinn could usually pull a fast one on their father now and again.  And unexpectedly would help their daughters out of jams.""Arts & Crass"" happens to be an excellent example, Jane & Daria get roped into participating with a poster contest for Lawndale High.  In true Daria fashion, Jane paints a picture of a young girl looking into a mirror, while Daria provides a rather controversial poem to go with it.  Amazingly, it gets submitted but Principal Li has the poem altered against Daria & Jane's wishes.  Of course, after they 'deface' their entry, Principal Li attempts in informing Daria's mom about the incident (apparently Jane's mother's off in her own little world).  But before Li can suggest any punishment, Helen utilizes her legal knowledge for getting Daria & Jane off the hook.Another reason Daria has endured so well is the characters develop than just keep on being 'recycled' in endless persona.  For instance in Season One, Quinn is essentially the superficial opposite of Daria. But at the end of Season Five - and the movie finale, she starts realizing there's more to life than just fashion and popularity, much to Sandy's chagrin.Overall, The Complete Series is great for any Daria fan out there, or someone who might want something a bit different than the teen fanfare shoveled out there by Disney.",5,One of the better animations emerging from MTV,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,3166,"['begin', 'review', 'yes', 'Glenn', 'Eichler', 'put', 'disclaimer', 'why', 'DVD', 'Collection', 'had', 'changed', 'music', 'sound', 'Mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'MTV', 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'using', 'network', 'whenever', 'attempt', 'put', 'medium', 'end', 'up', 'dealing', 'outrageous', 'licensing', 'issues.Bottom', 'line', 'impossible', 'release', 'collection', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'sell', '500', 'so', 'not', 'mention', 'getting', 'approval', 'artists', 'time', ""'d"", 'never', 'get', 'aforementioned', 'item', 'collection', 'such', 'Probably', 'why', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'Gamera', 'episodes', 'MST3K', 'DVD..', 'ah', 'well', '.But', 'enough', 'grousing', 'insignificant', 'details', 'let', 'get', 'collection', 'itself.First', 'amazing', 'something', 'spun-off', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'genuinely', 'became', 'animated', 'cult-classic', 'Essentially', 'time', 'Daria', 'was', 'simply', 'passing', 'character', 'attempting', 'be', 'voice', 'reason', 'guys', 'Whereas', 'here', 'pretty', 'much', 'realistic', 'teen', 'dealing', 'nonsense', 'up', 'high-school', 'life', 'Daria', 'refreshing', 'spin', 'when', 'watch', ""n't"", 'follow', 'typical', ""'teen"", 'mould', 'animation', 'angst', 'emotional', 'nonsense', ""'brainless"", 'adults', 'just', 'person', 'dealing', 'realistic', 'view', 'teenage', 'life', 'Back', 'late', '90', 'thanks', 'shows', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'Galaxy', 'High', 'other', 'teen-based', 'shows', 'there', 'basically', 'had', 'youth', 'coming', 'up', 'intelligent', 'know-it-alls', 'grown-ups', 'were', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'clueless', 'adults', 'Daria', 'usually', 'problem', 'adults', 'was', 'were', 'too', 'absorbed', 'agendas', 'being', 'too', 'condescending.Unlike', 'other', 'shows', 'Daria', 'parents', 'usually', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'times', 'even', 'sometimes', 'sister', 'Quinn', 'could', 'usually', 'pull', 'fast', 'one', 'father', 'now', 'again', 'unexpectedly', 'would', 'help', 'daughters', 'jams', 'Arts', 'Crass', 'be', 'excellent', 'example', 'Jane', 'Daria', 'get', 'roped', 'participating', 'poster', 'contest', 'Lawndale', 'High', 'true', 'Daria', 'fashion', 'Jane', 'picture', 'young', 'girl', 'looking', 'mirror', 'Daria', 'rather', 'controversial', 'poem', 'go', 'Amazingly', 'submitted', 'Principal', 'Li', 'poem', 'altered', 'Daria', 'Jane', 'wishes', 'course', ""'deface"", 'entry', 'Principal', 'Li', 'attempts', 'informing', 'Daria', 'mom', 'incident', 'apparently', 'Jane', 'mother', 'off', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'Li', 'can', 'suggest', 'punishment', 'Helen', 'legal', 'knowledge', 'getting', 'Daria', 'Jane', 'hook.Another', 'reason', 'Daria', 'endured', 'so', 'well', 'characters', 'develop', 'just', 'keep', 'being', ""'recycled"", 'endless', 'persona', 'instance', 'Season', 'One', 'Quinn', 'essentially', 'superficial', 'opposite', 'Daria', 'end', 'Season', 'Five', 'movie', 'finale', 'realizing', 'more', 'life', 'just', 'fashion', 'popularity', 'much', 'Sandy', 'chagrin.Overall', 'Complete', 'Series', 'great', 'Daria', 'fan', 'there', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'want', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'teen', 'fanfare', 'shoveled', 'there', 'Disney']",Daria: The Complete Animated Series

Whoa! This will be released on DVD on May 11th.Who can forget Daria Morgendorffer? Even I, who did not grow up with cable and wouldn't have been allowed to watch it if I did since teenagers were speaking rudely to their parents, knew the impact ""Daria"" had on the hearts and minds of the young. Watching it fresh for the first time as a 26 year old, it makes me flash back to those days in high school....*shudder* and I feel her pain that can only be combated by truly brilliant sarcasm.The series ""Daria"" paints a picture many young people are familiar with of high school jocks, cheerleaders, nerds, antisocial elitists, and the most ditzy ""popular"" younger sister along with a phony suburban mother and a clueless father. Parents have a lot of trouble understanding their kids when they get in high school -- case closed, there is no argument here. High school is a brutal trial by fire that is supposed to be some of the happiest days of our lives. Then thank goodness we graduate and move on to bigger and better things. Even college is scorned in this show as a series of frat parties, keg stands, and paying people to write your papers for you without a hint of real nostalgia. (Tangent: Yes, college is supposed to be the next stage of the ""best days"" and it too can have wonderful, endearing moments way more than high school every could, but wouldn't it really be great if we lived every day in the present without looking back or forward? I could be on to something here. Just sayin'. ;-) )The character Daria just doesn't fit in anywhere and doesn't WANT to. She scorns everyone and would much rather sit back with her friend, Jane and puzzle on the mystery of other people's idiosyncrasies. Her sarcasm is hilarious and unforgettable as she would tell a whole sub-population of people to go to hell if she actually cared about them. If you looked up ""indifference"" in the dictionary, you would probably see her picture.This series ran for five seasons and even included two movies, all of which are included in this set. Unfortunately it is in full-screen, but what can you do? It ran from 1997-2002. A major difference that might be noticed by fans of the show that is addressed in an insert in the case is that 99% of the music changed because of the cost of licensing it and that's why it's taken so long to release this collection.Bonus Features:The Pilot episode ""Sealed with a Kick"" is included as a bonus....I thought it was part of the collection *shrug*. Also you get to see Mystik Spiral's music video ""Freakin' Friends"" featuring Trent Lane singing. There are written character profiles on EVERYONE so that should keep you occupied for a while if all the other content wasn't enough!The two movies in the series are included as extras on the last disc: ""Is It Fall Yet?"" and ""Is It College Yet?"" They are both like extended episodes in the spirit of the series. The Fall one focuses on summer plans and College obviously on the future.Top Ten Video Countdown hosted by Daria & Jane is great if you like the MTV's countdowns. You get to see Daria and Jane using as much sarcasm as possible in their introductions but it does not show any of the actual music videos since that would require too much licensing. Mystik Spiral spin-off script is a DVD-ROM extra available for download. It is a third draft that was never made into a series.The cast and crew interviews give a lot of background to the series. MTV was looking for an animated series that would appeal more to women and Daria started as a character on ""Beavis and Butthead"" and decided to create a spin-off with her and they needed a strong female protagonist. The show developed naturally without a lot of direction and it was pretty much a free-for-all in the first season. The same voice-over actress, Wendy Hoopes voiced Quinn, her mother Helen, and Daria's best friend Jane by using different registers in her voice.",5,Daria: The Complete Series on DVD finally is a welcome back for our favorite sarcastic high school student,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,4059,"['Daria', 'Complete', 'Animated', 'SeriesThe', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Full-Screen', 'Format', 'Five', 'Seasons', '2', 'Movies', '8', 'Discs', 'running', 'time', '1606', 'minutes', 'Whoa', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'May', '11th.Who', 'can', 'forget', 'Daria', 'Morgendorffer', 'Even', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'cable', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'watch', 'did', 'teenagers', 'were', 'speaking', 'rudely', 'parents', 'knew', 'impact', 'Daria', 'had', 'hearts', 'minds', 'young', 'Watching', 'fresh', 'first', 'time', '26', 'year', 'old', 'flash', 'back', 'days', 'high', 'school', '.*shudder*', 'feel', 'pain', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'combated', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'sarcasm.The', 'series', 'Daria', 'picture', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'familiar', 'high', 'school', 'jocks', 'cheerleaders', 'nerds', 'antisocial', 'elitists', 'most', 'ditzy', 'popular', 'younger', 'sister', 'phony', 'suburban', 'mother', 'clueless', 'father', 'Parents', 'have', 'lot', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'kids', 'when', 'get', 'high', 'school', 'case', 'closed', 'argument', 'here', 'High', 'school', 'brutal', 'trial', 'fire', 'supposed', 'be', 'happiest', 'days', 'lives', 'Then', 'thank', 'goodness', 'graduate', 'move', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'Even', 'college', 'scorned', 'show', 'series', 'frat', 'parties', 'keg', 'stands', 'paying', 'people', 'write', 'papers', 'hint', 'real', 'nostalgia', 'Tangent', 'Yes', 'college', 'supposed', 'be', 'next', 'stage', 'best', 'days', 'too', 'can', 'have', 'wonderful', 'endearing', 'moments', 'way', 'more', 'high', 'school', 'could', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'great', 'lived', 'day', 'present', 'looking', 'back', 'forward', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'here', 'Just', 'sayin', 'character', 'Daria', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'anywhere', ""n't"", 'WANT', 'everyone', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'sit', 'back', 'friend', 'Jane', 'puzzle', 'mystery', 'other', 'people', 'idiosyncrasies', 'sarcasm', 'hilarious', 'unforgettable', 'would', 'tell', 'whole', 'sub-population', 'people', 'go', 'hell', 'actually', 'cared', 'looked', 'up', 'indifference', 'dictionary', 'would', 'probably', 'see', 'picture.This', 'series', 'ran', 'five', 'seasons', 'even', 'included', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'included', 'set', 'full-screen', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'ran', '1997-2002', 'major', 'difference', 'might', 'be', 'noticed', 'fans', 'show', 'addressed', 'insert', 'case', '99', '%', 'music', 'changed', 'cost', 'licensing', 'why', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'release', 'collection.Bonus', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'Sealed', 'Kick', 'included', 'bonus', '.I', 'thought', 'was', 'part', 'collection', '*shrug*', 'Also', 'get', 'see', 'Mystik', 'Spiral', 'music', 'video', 'Freakin', 'Friends', 'featuring', 'Trent', 'Lane', 'singing', 'are', 'written', 'character', 'profiles', 'EVERYONE', 'should', 'keep', 'occupied', 'while', 'other', 'content', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'two', 'movies', 'series', 'are', 'included', 'extras', 'last', 'disc', 'Fall', 'Yet', 'College', 'are', 'extended', 'episodes', 'spirit', 'series', 'Fall', 'one', 'summer', 'plans', 'College', 'obviously', 'future.Top', 'Ten', 'Video', 'Countdown', 'hosted', 'Daria', 'Jane', 'great', 'like', 'MTV', 'countdowns', 'get', 'see', 'Daria', 'Jane', 'using', 'as', 'much', 'sarcasm', 'possible', 'introductions', 'not', 'show', 'actual', 'music', 'videos', 'would', 'require', 'too', 'much', 'licensing', 'Mystik', 'Spiral', 'spin-off', 'script', 'DVD-ROM', 'extra', 'available', 'download', 'third', 'draft', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'series.The', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'give', 'lot', 'background', 'series', 'MTV', 'was', 'looking', 'animated', 'series', 'would', 'appeal', 'more', 'women', 'Daria', 'started', 'character', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'decided', 'create', 'spin-off', 'needed', 'strong', 'female', 'protagonist', 'show', 'developed', 'naturally', 'lot', 'direction', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'free-for-all', 'first', 'season', 'same', 'voice-over', 'actress', 'Wendy', 'Hoopes', 'voiced', 'Quinn', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Daria', 'best', 'friend', 'Jane', 'using', 'different', 'registers', 'voice']",Daria: The Complete Animated Series

1164526,A106016KSI0YQ,B0019N8P2W,Jay Dickson,"[3, 3]","The release of MTV's brilliant DARIA animated series was held up for a long time because of problems with music rights; finally the series has been released, minus some of the terrific pop soundtrack that sparked it so much. But it's more than worth seeing even without that. There just hadn't been another series about teenagers before quite like this series (originally a spin-off from BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, though that's hard now to imagine). Many series in the 90s paid attention to the growing pains outcasts of high school (such as FREAKS AND GEEKS), or to the anxieties of the popular kids (such as BEVERLY HILLS 90210), but never to both; what's more, DARIA paid equal attention to the screwed-up lives of the kids' parents and their high school teachers, all of whom were shown to be just a little bit off-kilter.Like most of the other kids in her placeless, affluent suburb of Lawndale, Daria lives with her family in an ugly McMansion. Smart but deeply alienated, she attracts attention from her parents and her teachers for her intelligence but also disapproval for her unwillingness to be a joiner; she spends most of her time zoned out with her best friend, the wry and artistic Jane Lane, either sharing pizza or watching the popular television freak show SICK, SAD WORLD (which cannot match the bizarreness of Lawndale itself). Daria's emotionally wounded and hyperambitious parents, Jake and Helen, are too engrossed with their careers to take much notice of their daughter, and her teachers (almost all of whom are, like Jake and Helen, also narcissistic Baby Boomers) are baffled by Daria's disaffection and mostly ignore her. Her selfish sister Quinn, in order to remain popular with the reigning girls' clique (which is brilliantly self-titled ""the Fashion Club"") pretends at school they are not even siblings. But despite so much alienation and disconnection, almost everybody in the large cast appears in nearly every episode and gets something to say, which is part of the joy of the show. Teenagers of Daria's age tend to stay focused on Daria's romantic problems, first with her deeply embarrassing crush on Jane's slacker brother Trent, and then with preppy Tom, her first real boyfriend. But adults will enjoy the show for the hilarious attention paid not just to the kids' social circle but also to Daria's messed-up parents and teachers, who are also delineated with loving attention. One of the greatest pleasures of the series is how despite the charmingly flat animation style the characters continue to round themselves out and develop as, for example, Quinn deals with the berserkly petty power dynamics within the Fashion Club, Helen comes to realize her eldest daughter's extreme disaffection is a genuine coping strategy, and Daria learns to understand that there might be something of value behind the eyes of the other denizens of her teenage suburban wasteland.If anything, the series is hilarious just for the brilliant voice work of the regular performers, probably the best group to work for an animated series (with the possible exception of THE SIMPSONS) in fifty years. The real star, of course, is the gifted Wendy Hoopes, who voices three of the major characters: the vain Quinn, the arch Jane Lane, and the breathily intense Helen, whose loopy salutation on her ubiquitous cellphone--""Hel-LOOOoo?""--cracks me up every time. There are wonderful sociological details scattered throughout, from the snide social commentary from the parents of Jodi (the hyperachieving African-American class president, and Daria's only other friend besides Jane), to the reverence with which the security-obsessed principal Ms. Li always speaks whenever she invokes the name of Lawndale High. Some episodes are certainly better than others (a flight of fancy where the teenage embodiments of the holidays visit Lawndale, for example, seems a real misfire). But when the series episodes are at their best--perhaps most memorably in ""Daria!"" (a musical episode that preceded a similar stunt on BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), ""Quinn the Brain,"" ""Monster,"" and, my own favorite, ""The Daria Hunter"" (the Lawndale kids and their chaperoning parents are taken to a paintball park, where, of course, the Fashion Club assassinate one another with startling dispatch, and Daria is shot by her own mother: ""Oh Daria, you're not even TRYING!"")--it is one of the funniest television shows of the 1990s. This boxed set also comes with the two TV-movies MTV made for the series, ""Is It Fall Yet?"" and ""Is It College Yet?,"" plus such delights as a rock-video for Trent Lane's terrible punk band Mystik Spiral (which is going to get a better name some day, if the members could just think of one).",5,"Sick, Sad World",1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,4705,"['release', 'MTV', 'brilliant', 'DARIA',

1164528,A3UNITKTFPNT9W,B0019N8P2W,"J.F. Carroll ""the man from san dusky""","[1, 1]","Oh, Daria, how I love thee. You are as keen as cats and ribald as rats. With your soft blowing brown hair and glasses all 'aharried. Your green jacket so thin and your skirt all 'aruffle, you are indeed a little charmer.I love this show. I can't even begin to say what it would have meant to me to have even known a character like this existed when I went to high school, starting in late 2002. Let's just say it might have meant the difference between outright depression and isolation and perhaps overall acceptance of my situation. But that's not the show's fault, that's TV's fault for all but disappearing the show after it ended. Apparently it was on logo or nogin from time to time throughout the years, but I never really watched those channels way up on the cable channel counter. I remember watching MTV throughout those years but it was always Celebrity Team Death Match or Jackass. A part of me is sad that I didn't at least catch a glimpse of this show when it might have still been on. I was just a dumb boy who liked violence like every other dumb boy.I only finally even knew about the show when the DVD came out, and my, what an impact it did make. I know everyone says this, but I WAS Daria in high school. I realized I had a sight problem early in my Sophomore year, so I had to get glasses and wear them all the time for the first time in my life. I didn't know anything about athletics and was overweight (since fixed with constant exercise, which no one tells you about when you're in high school unless you're already naturally inclined or forced by your parents to be on a sports team) and really looked a drag, I'm sure. I wasn't bullied or anything, just sort of left in the ionosphere, ignored. My only truly difficult year was probably my Senior year, when the cliques were at their greatest maturation and ripeness, and I was doing all the core classes I never wanted to do because I had only taken art classes instead in my freshman year. I remember I was in a certain club that had changed since the last year into an extremely anal experience because the teacher wanted to win awards and accolades. Ok, it was yearbook, and it was awful. A lot of the departments received extra funding and this created new expectations.I was also on drugs for ADHD, even though I now know I probably didn't really have a focus problem but rather I was just lazy. I just didn't care, never did care. I graduated college after high school, having gotten off those big pharma drugs that have the tendency to ruin your life, started exercising, cleaned myself up, and after a bout with depression caused by trying to fit in and smoke MJ with fake friends, I'm now in a much better place. I didn't want to be all personal in an Amazon review, but if there's some lonely high school student out there, I just want them to know it gets better. What Daria teaches us is screw all those people, I have my own life to live. The pressures of society don't matter, just as long as I'm doing ok.I just can't help but remember the horrible time that high school was for me. Daria reveals all of this. The show teaches us that no one has it particularly EASY in high school, even if the popular kids go out of their way to wreck the lives of anyone who is different, which never really ends, by the way. People are dumb, stupid social animals that are, like, engineered to hate nonconformity. Those who continue their education past high school often grow to be enlightened later on though (one hopes).We all go through some sick twisted stuff when we're going through puberty and having to deal with a million different kinds of people and social situations and grades and stress in high school, and no show ever captured this like Daria. Daria isn't exactly an amazing perfect super genius, she has faults and worries, she deals with isolation and gets help from friends and parents as she's growing up in superficial Lawndale. As I watch the show today I see how I was like Daria, and I'm very glad this show is on DVD, and within the reach of anyone who needs it. Even if we are going through it alone we can know that there's been millions of people who have been disenfranchised through an establishment of order like high school, and there's understanding. Certainly it seems the writers understood that high school wasn't all about being perky and buying the next clothing line or corporate product. High School can be REAL MISERY. I think it's important we give each other a break when we're in high school, or at least the benefit of the doubt.If I had only had this show in 2002, I think it would have made a difference. When I watched the whole thing through two years ago it was an enormous epiphany. I realized I WASN'T alone. It was like a total moment of clarity, like a cleansing of the soul. I didn't have to carry those old memories on my back so much anymore. All I ever needed was for someone to understand. No tv show ever had that kind of impact on me. It was sort of like reading Harry Potter, the hero isn't some perfect superchampion with six pack abs, just a regular kid who got a bad deal. I guess I didn't have to hate myself anymore after Daria, I could sympathize with my old self and the difficulty of the whole High School situation. Not that running a lot didn't help that too.Finally, the music makes no difference to me. I was born too late to have ever been a big fan of that millenium music anyways. I watched a few episodes on some Russian site with the music still in and found it distracting. I listen to more than enough music on my own, I don't need MTV music propaganda hovering through the best moments of the show. Without the music the show is more timeless, I think, even if it may add context for certain key situations. I'm sure if they ever did release the show with the music intact I'd watch it just to compare, but I'd rather have all the episodes in good picture quality than anything else.Also, the first season or so is where it's really at. The show had already begun a slow fade after season three. The 2000s would not be kind to the ideals of Daria. I watch these episodes from '97 and 2000 and I think, wow, what a bunch of complainers! haha! Most of us young people don't even have the opportunity to work anymore, we can't even get full time jobs! There'll be a line of dialogue and I'll be like, oh, just wait until Bush gets into office! Then you'll REALLY be depressed! In fact the whole Lane family is living on the street in 2013. There's hardly any Time magazine or National Geographic paying huge sums for Celtic Rock formation photos anymore, or consumer money to pay for bad pottery or paintings. Daria is completely the product of an American economy that was actually working for all the people, the intellectuals, the scientists, the creative types, rather than just the business executives. Jodie and her family would be doing great. I don't even want to think about Kevin and Brittany, although I think they might have gotten tons of work in the superficial Bush Era 2000s.America is such a screwed up nation now compared to 1997, there's no time to complain about existential conundrums that were summed up so well on the show Seinfeld and Daria as well. It's hard just to keep a job now! I watch this show and I think, lucky b@$#%&^!, I'd a' had my 401k set up by the crisis in 2008! Course then it would have just been wiped out. They had no idea all the crap that was coming down the pipe by the time the show had stopped being written--probably by the end of summer 2001. I wonder if they were still writing that last movie when the towers got hit?Daria puts me in a mood of nostalgia, as you might or might not be able to tell, a very strong sense of the past. If they were to make new episodes of this show today I think it might just be the greatest thing ever, way better than Beavis and Butthead coming back (no music videos to fart on anymore). Daria would likely have plenty to say about our modern world.And that stuff's being said every night on the Colbert Report, which I don't watch.peace.",5,"my favorite show of all time, and I didn't

Huff ""Color Me Noir""","[1, 1]","I used to watch this when it was on M-TV but I only caught about one episode in 5 so seeing all of the episodes was a real treat! Just as funny and thought provoking as I remember - AHHH!! the young and fastidious of the M-TV generation. The box set is simple and compact with great graphics on each disc. Only a few extras such as interviews with some of the talent, pilot ""Sealed with a kick"" used to pitch the show and the two 'movies' ('Is it fall yet?' 'Is It college yet?') and Daria and Jane 'Intros' used for 'Daria Day' a day long tribute. I'm NOT big on extras, but these were 'Just Right'. My only complaint is the lack of any episode list or list of extras, there was a single insert sheet with a thank you from the creator Glenn Eichler which was blank on the other side. The only way to find out what is on the discs is to put them in to see the menus. Also the 'Daria Day' intros can only be seen if you play individual episodes and select the episode with the intro.

The supporting cast of characters is richly developed, and unusually for a series like this, the adults get equal time in the stories. Another wonderful feature of this series is the fact that it actually has an end to it that is both heartwarming and thoughtful. In the end, this is not a series just for teen age girls.

1164535,AF4ZXRVQD8JDM,B0019N8P2W,Justin,"[15, 17]","First off, I just wanna say that I, for one, am glad the show was released on DVD at all, given that its been many years with nothing. It was one of my absolute favorites as a teenager and I was SO excited to hear it was FINALLY coming out. Daria does, in fact, rock.That aside...I wanna address some of the ""issues"" in this release. The music, 99% of it, has been changed. Yes, if you've recorded it and watched it on video for years and you know EVERY song inside out, you may be disappointed. However, if you never did this and you waited for a proper DVD release, you may not notice too much. There are moments here and there that I notice a particular song has been changed but, for the most part, they did a REALLY great job in replacing it with stuff that sounds very similar to what was there. Fitting the mood of the scenes and all. You can tell that actual thought was put into it and they didn't just lump some generic elevator music in. I think, if they just HAD to replace the music, they did a pretty good job.As far as sound and picture quality...I've noticed shakiness and some obvious cuts, probably from where they put scenes back into cut versions of the episodes. Yes, they are ALL uncut on this release, which is a great thing. Overall, the quality is pretty good. It's decent. Yes, it IS, of course, in full frame as opposed to widescreen...why I've seen people complaining about this is beyond me because I wouldn't have expected anything else. I think some people just like complaining.The packaging, in my opinion, is where the release really falls short. It's a large, plastic, standard DVD case with a plastic insert containing 4 double sided hard plastic ""pages"", it's like a book...if you often buy DVDs, you know what I'm talking about. Each DVD has it's own place so they ARE secure and safe from scratches. As you can tell, so far, this is nothing special at all. No box with artwork, not even so much as a cardboard slip of any kind. No episode guide either, which would have been REALLY nice to have. The artwork is just so-so, nothing special and there isn't much of it. They really dropped the ball in this aspect.Content...you basically get everything as far as I can see. Every uncut episode from all 5 seasons including the 2 TV movies ""Is it Fall Yet?"" and ""Is It College Yet?"". The features are the original pilot episode ""Sealed with a Kick"", Mystik Spiral music video ""Freakin' Friends"", Daria Day intros, Top Ten Video Countdown hosted by Daria and Jane, Never before seen Mystik Spiral spin-off script and cast & crew interviews. The original theme song IS there as well.Overall, I'm happy with the set the way it is. Yes, all the little things that could have been done would have been pretty nice. The music could have been left in, the packaging could have been A LOT better...but ya know what? It isn't. We have what we have, it's good enough. The show is still intact.

However, nostalgia got the best of me and I ordered these.This show has stood the test of time.It is even more enjoyable to me now than when I was in high school. The social commentary and issues faced by Daria are every bit as relevant today as they were 17 years ago when the show first aired in 1997. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the characters genuinely funny, and the apathetic way Daria approaches life is more relevant to me as I approach 30 than it was when I was 15.In terms of packaging, it's a basic hard black case that holds 8 discs, spanning 5 seasons. The discs all hold approximately the same number of episodes so multiple seasons may be present on a single disc.This was fine to me because I prefer to binge watch these anyway so the fewer discs I have to change the better. Having it all in one compact set works for me too, less space to take up on my shelf.Additionally, as noted you won't be getting the original music from the show when you buy this. Apparently the only reason Daria took so long to be released on DVD is that the music in the show was too expensive to feasibly include on the set.

I rejoiced.Second, I found it at the store.Third, I was confused by the packaging (8 disks in a standard DVD box?! WHAT)...and finally, fourth, I looked it up on Amazon to see if I could get a better deal (over $70 at the store.. o_O) and lo and behold - I find out that we have once again been bent over the table by the music industry.My husband works from within the industry and he can tell you first hand how corrupt it is: from ignorant kids being taken advantage of by signing horrid contracts to performers killing people and having the label clean up the PR nightmare.  If you are thinking about getting into this industry, I highly recommend the adult entertainment industry - it's less corrupt.This is the same issue (music) that killed the Beavis and Butthead boxed set(s) for me - it's like trying to watch Jaws to Tangerine Dream.  It just doesn't have nearly the same impact as the original. Now, one would think that because the music was paid for and royalties given (like in a movie or other television shows) at time of airing and re-airing, this would allow them to be included in DVD form (IE would allow for smoother contract negotiation)...yet they are missing.  I also find this extremely interesting that it seems MTV has the most problems with this issue.  This leads me to believe MTV (and its associates/VIACOM) simply does not want to pony up the funds required to grant the many artists used for their animated series the royalties they deserve OR they are planning to trickle the music back in (IE what they sort-of did with the newest Beavis and Butthead boxed sets) to attempt to milk the public.  The third possibility is the multiple record labels involved cannot reach an agreement with VIACOM, which is also money-related....and they wonder why the torrents do so well.I may buy this product when the price drops somewhere in the $20s. Used.  I refuse to shell out retail monies for what I view as an inferior product.Update: A friend of mine bought the series and it was even worse than the comparison videos expressed.  The change in music affected the atmosphere and nostalgia to the point of distraction, the extras were laughable, and - most of all - the transfer was TERRIBLE.  Dirty, jittering, color-fading mess... far from what a show of this popularity and standing in the realm of MTV shows deserves.  I still refuse to buy this product new until a version worthy of the show is released.  I do not wish for this awful handling to taint this show for me... I like it far too much.**Speshul peepuhl knowtation: it's ok if you don't agree, we are all people of the earth, holding hands with the magical unicorns of tolerance and internet. So just remember to buy the world a Coke :D**...but seriously, cool your jets.  This is one of my favorite shows... I'd think that fans would be in agreement that Daria needs a more worthy release.

Firstly, I am thankful that they released the entire series at once so we never had to worry about poor sales or stupid executives only allowing partial release of the series. Secondly, I did enjoy the special features but wish they'd had more, maybe some commentaries, to make up for the absence of proper music. There is also a paper inside the set telling us, in Daria fashion, to be happy we got the set at all and I found it funny and in tone with the show. That said it would have been nice to have a proper booklet with episode summaries and show facts to go along with it.Watching the show with the music changes I will say it's still a funny and enjoyable show, but even to those who say they didn't pay much attention to the music, I think you'll still sense an absence. It's not enough to ruin my enjoyment of this great series but I can best describe it by saying when I watch the show without proper music it feels as though one of the main characters is missing. I still enjoy it but in the back of my mind I keep wondering when and if that main character will return. At any rate getting the complete series with a few special features for this price is more than worth it.To sum up this show is great regardless but it does suck that songs inevitably had to be changed and left out since the late 90's and early millenium music is a character of the show.

I will admit when this first came on MTV, I didn't have the same level of appreciation for it like I do now.  I love the Daria and Jane characters, because I see a lot of them within myself.  As for the best seasons, hands down the honor goes to Seasons 2 & 4.  Those seasons were clever, very well written and believeable.  As for my least favorite episode of the series that went to 'Depth Takes a Holiday' and best episode 'Write Where It Hurts.'The combo movie editions were great adds to the disc set -- 'Is It Fall Yet' starts to show the growth and maturity of Quinn.  I loved how the writers never forgot episode 1's question from the History course on Daria's first day at Lawndale, ""Can anyone explain Manifest Destiny?"" and brought it back to use for Quinn.  Such a smart move by the writers if you ask me!The disc set, does not contain the original music used for each episode.

1164578,A1WPYY2XLOKAT8,B0019N8P2W,The Completist,"[24, 26]","The release of ""DARIA"" on DVD is a mixed blessing: on one hand, it's a long-overdue release of a genuinely excellent series (that I continued to watch weekly even AFTER graduating high school); on the other, its also a painfully truncated version of it that kinda ruins the nostalgia for those of us who remember it differently (with the VHS evidence to prove it).THE GOOD NEWS: the boxed set allows for complete viewing.  It's very easy to catch up or completely introduce yourself to the series if you were too young the first time around.  And you get to see all five years at once rather than scrounging around for multiple seasons.  I suppose it is better for the show to be available and doctored than to be unavailable at all, since the characters and writing were the key to its power.AND we get the Pilot episode, which is nice.THE BAD NEWS: Well, let's start with the music: we all knew that the original music was never going to be included; no one at Viacom will spend the money for licensing on every episode, and until a wealthy fan does so on their own dime, it'll be a dream unrealized.  But the generic music is kinda hard to deal with because sometimes its louder than the dialogue in the scene, or doesn't fit at all.  Also, the Splendora theme song for the opening titles is a different recording than the original broadcast and can be a bit annoying, although some of the Splendora cues made specifically for the movies are still intact.  The music situation is probably only going to hurt purists like me who remember the show from the first time around.Here are some others, some big, others just nitpicky:- The second movie/last episode ""IS IT COLLEGE YET?"" is the censored Noggin-channel version.  While I've resigned myself to the music problems, this one is inexcusable; MTV owns the series, it should have the original print somewhere.- The special features are a joke.  Again, due to music issues, the specials ""Look Back in Annoyance"" and ""Behind the Scenes at Daria"" are absent, and the retrospective is painfully short, with snippets of interviews rather than actual ones.  Also absent are any TV spots for music (like the Garbage promo from ""IS IT FALL YET?"").  However, the animated sections from an MTV video countdown are included, though not the videos themselves.- The show is in order but with no season dividers; you have to research which episodes were in which season.- The early episodes are a bit faded; they aren't damaged, but the color isn't as sharp as the later episodes.- Closed Captioning but no subtitles.- The movies are shoved on the extras disc, not given context as to which seasons they capped off (video quality is SLIGHTLY inferior as a result).So overall, the collection isn't a waste for those who want to experience the show as a whole and not as a time capsule.  For those who want the show in its entirety uncut and unaltered...we still have our VHS collections.  But while some things were unavoidable due to rather large legal issues (the music), other things that were entirely solvable (uncut versions, picture quality, etc.), make this an underwhelming accomplishment.  Considering how well the ""AEON FLUX"" boxed set turned out, and how terrible the ""BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD"" boxed sets turned out, this one falls in between: neither as good or as bad as it COULD have been.  Three stars is being generous.Regardless, I would suggest waiting for sales or markdowns to buy it; at the current price it isn't worth it.",3,Not an ENTIRE waste of money...,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,3479,"['release', 'DARIA', 'DVD', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'one', 'hand', 'long-overdue', 'release', 'genuinely', 'excellent', 'series', 'continued', 'watch', 'weekly', 'even', 'AFTER', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'other', 'also', 'painfully', 'truncated', 'version', 'nostalgia', 'who', 'remember', 'differently', 'VHS', 'evidence', 'prove', '.THE', 'GOOD', 'NEWS', 'boxed', 'set', 'complete', 'viewing', 'very', 'easy', 'catch', 'up', 'completely', 'introduce', 'series', 'were', 'too', 'young', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'get', 'see', 'five', 'years', 'once', 'rather', 'scrounging', 'multiple', 'seasons', 'suppose', 'better', 'show', 'be', 'available', 'doctored', 'be', 'unavailable', 'characters', 'writing', 'were', 'key', 'power.AND', 'get', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'nice.THE', 'BAD', 'NEWS', 'Well', 'let', 'start', 'music', 'knew', 'original', 'music', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'included', 'one', 'Viacom', 'will', 'spend', 'money', 'licensing', 'episode', 'wealthy', 'fan', 'so', 'own', 'dime', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dream', 'unrealized', 'generic', 'music', 'kinda', 'hard', 'deal', 'because', 'louder', 'dialogue', 'scene', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Also', 'Splendora', 'theme', 'song', 'opening', 'titles', 'different', 'recording', 'original', 'broadcast', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'annoying', 'Splendora', 'cues', 'made', 'specifically', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'intact', 'music', 'situation', 'probably', 'only', 'going', 'hurt', 'purists', 'who', 'remember', 'show', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'others', 'big', 'others', 'just', 'nitpicky', 'second', 'movie/last', 'episode', 'IT', 'COLLEGE', 'YET', 'censored', 'Noggin-channel', 'version', ""'ve"", 'resigned', 'music', 'problems', 'one', 'inexcusable', 'MTV', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'original', 'print', 'somewhere.-', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'joke', 'Again', 'due', 'music', 'issues', 'specials', 'Look', 'Back', 'Annoyance', 'Scenes', 'Daria', 'are', 'absent', 'retrospective', 'painfully', 'short', 'snippets', 'interviews', 'rather', 'actual', 'ones', 'Also', 'absent', 'are', 'TV', 'spots', 'music', 'Garbage', 'promo', 'IT', 'FALL', 'YET', 'However', 'animated', 'sections', 'MTV', 'video', 'countdown', 'are', 'included', 'not', 'videos', 'themselves.-', 'show', 'order', 'season', 'dividers', 'have', 'research', 'were', 'season.-', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'faded', 'are', ""n't"", 'damaged', 'color', ""n't"", 'as', 'sharp', 'later', 'episodes.-', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'subtitles.-', 'movies', 'are', 'shoved', 'extras', 'disc', 'not', 'given', 'context', 'seasons', 'capped', 'off', 'video', 'quality', 'SLIGHTLY', 'inferior', 'result', '.So', 'overall', 'collection', ""n't"", 'waste', 'who', 'want', 'experience', 'show', 'whole', 'not', 'time', 'capsule', 'who', 'want', 'show', 'entirety', 'uncut', 'unaltered', 'still', 'have', 'VHS', 'collections', 'things', 'were', 'unavoidable', 'due', 'rather', 'large', 'legal', 'issues', 'music', 'other', 'things', 'were', 'entirely', 'solvable', 'uncut', 'versions', 'picture', 'quality', 'etc', 'make', 'underwhelming', 'accomplishment', 'Considering', 'how', 'well', 'AEON', 'FLUX', 'boxed', 'set', 'turned', 'out', 'how', 'terrible', 'BEAVIS', 'BUTT-HEAD', 'boxed', 'sets', 'turned', 'out', 'one', 'good', 'as', 'bad', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'Three', 'stars', 'being', 'generous.Regardless', 'would', 'suggest', 'waiting', 'sales', 'markdowns', 'buy', 'current', 'price', ""n't"", 'worth']",Daria: The Complete Animated Series
1164579,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B0019N8P2W,Theo,"[4, 6]","I so loved the first season of Daria. Refreshingly nihilistic and amoral, Daria represented a truly wonderful break from the saccharine pap we're usually fed. I'd give season one five stars in a heartbeat. But from season two onwards... well, I guess we'll get to that in a moment.But first, as is the case with any TV show transferred to DVD, it needs to be acknowledged that there are really two issues here: the show itself and the transfer. As most readers will already know, with Daria the big issue with the transfer was the music. Because the original show sampled from so many popular artists, a full and faithful reproduction on a non-bootlegged DVD was always going to be a copyright impossibility. In the end, virtually none of the original background music survived.Given this reality, for the most part I take off my hat to the musicians who did end up providing the substitute background music for the DVD.  They took on what was always going to be a thankless task and for the most part acquitted themselves pretty well. True, there are moments here and there where the music they provide is noticeably weaker than what we heard in the TV original. But overall they do a fairly solid job. Personally, what I miss most is not the lost background music per se, but the varied and eclectic range of songs used as end title music in the original broadcasts. These often provided an ironic or poignant counterpoint to the themes explored in the episode.Now for the show itself. After season one things begin to go downhill. Slowly and intermittently at first, but by progressively greater leaps and bounds. The most marked change is that Daria the sardonic observer of human folly is replaced by Daria the moral crusader. The show's dry edge isn't entirely lost, but it is substantially dulled.Curiously, the season two opener is an episode called ""Arts 'n' Crass"" where Daria and Jane collaborate on an artistic work that is then horrendously sanitized by school administrators. I can't help but wonder if the irony here is deliberate: if there was at least someone behind the scenes who fully grasped what was being done to the show, and felt the urge to give voice to this protest. If so, the protest is remarkably clever and doubly ironic, because how Daria and Jane handle the situation that has been thrust upon them fits seamlessly in with the show's new direction.Side by side with the rise of moral Daria is the even more awful way that the show's only two black characters (Jodie and Mac) are developed.  In order to appreciate what went wrong here, you need to understand that the Daria universe is a kind of reverse meritocracy. The popular kids at the top of the social totem pole are vacuous and self absorbed airheads, possessing no particular virtue or talent beyond physical beauty, athletic ability, and perhaps a certain low cunning  - this last trait being best exemplified by the character of Sandy. But low cunning is as close to intelligence as they get; for as Daria herself quips, ""there's no sadder sight on this Earth than a football player trying to think"".  By contrast, it is the outsiders, those far from the centers of popularity and power, who are for the most part the only ones to evidence any real depth, intelligence, or insight. This station is of course best exemplified by the character of Daria herself.The show's only real black male character is not only a football player - he's captain of the team! And yet he's also obviously intelligent (at one point he's discovered to be the only player on the team who can count in fractions) and even a nice guy to boot. All this and yes, popular too! A clear impossibility in the Daria universe.In fact, in terms of the rules that the show applies to all its other characters, Mac and Jodie are both to all intents and purposes superhuman. It's affirmative action gone mad. If the show's creators had wanted to achieve something genuinely progressive on this front, they might more intelligently and successfully achieved that goal by instead setting the series in a school with more than two black students. Failing that, they could even have tried making the black characters they did have into something actually human.Not that it was ever really about affirmative action, of course. It was about being ""cool"", and appealing to the white, middle class, rap-loving kids who constituted MTV's core demographic. I think that at some point the show's creators did realize they'd overshot the mark - that they'd made Mac and Jodie into virtual demigods. There was a point in the show where they seemed to try to backpaddle a bit, to give the characters some problems and some foibles. But these were never entirely credible, so overall I'd have to rate the effort as a day late and a dollar short.That issue aside, even after nihilistic Daria has been wholly devoured by crusading Daria, the show continues to decline. It's still quite watchable almost until the very end, but it's far from what it once was. By the final season, not even Daria the moral crusader is enough for whoever was calling the shots. At this point Daria and her sister Quinn both go through a process of ""character development"" in which they come to appreciate the importance of sisterly love and family values. By the final episode the show really is just an animated version of Family Ties. No wonder the producers ended the series at that point. Their mission was complete. There was simply no lower that they could go.And what, I can't help but wonder, would Daria herself - the season one Daria - have had to say about all this? Perhaps only the obvious:That it really is a sick, sad world.Theo.",3,The Descent of Daria,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,5668,"['so', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'Daria', 'Refreshingly', 'nihilistic',

Two weeks later, I've viewed every single episode from every season, and every second of every extra--and I loved every moment.  The show is even better than I remembered, definitely funnier than I remembered, and infinitely more touching.

Rigney,"[99, 104]","In the era when MTV still gave a crap about not pandering to the lowest common denominator with its programming, there was ""Daria"".The irony is, ""Daria"" was spun off from the ridiculous, but admittedly amusing, ""Beavis and Butthead"" series. Where that show gleefully wallowed in the stupid and moronic, ""Daria"" went in the opposite direction. Using her sarcasm, commentary, and general cynicism, the show showed that one could be intelligent and blunt but still be entertaining. In its way, the show dealt with the usual crap of being a teen without being preachy, moralistic, or boring. And it assumed that the audience was smart. Which MTV obviously no longer does.Admittedly, I am not in the demographic for this show (30s), but a smart show is a smart show, and I have waited for this series for ages. It is long past time this series is finally being released. Maybe it will make some remember when MTV was relevant, socially aware, and treated young people like thinking beings and not Barbie and Ken dolls for reality TV crap. I think - if one like smart shows with an edge - one would love ""Daria"", regardless of age. (Ironically, I think the character of Daria, if she existed naturally, would have plenty to say about the state of the channel today that she originated from. And none of it good! LOL!)On the downside, I am 99.999% sure there will be music deletions and substitutions, the dreaded ""rights issues"". While I do wish that would be left intact, I guess I could see where it would be cost prohibitive, and this series is too good to sit in a vault because of it. Which is why I still give this DVD set five stars regardless of that issue. So, I will live with the music changes. But complain. Daria would be pleased!In short, if you like animation, wit, fun, intelligence, and snark (of which there is plenty!), let ""Daria"" entertain you! You'll feel smarter for it.Edited to add, as I have answered another review via the comment link, and it may not be readily seen: Daria the Musical episode *is* included on this DVD set, making it, as advertised, the ""complete"" series! Its production number was 301; however, MTV used ""Through A Lens Darkly"" as the Season 3 premiere years ago, and the DVD order is the same way. Daria The Musical is episode #7 in Season 3, as it was when it originally aired. And it is the one episode retaining its original end music over the alter egos/credits.Also, regrettably, ""Is It College Yet"" is again the edited version, but from another account here in the discussion thread regarding this set, MTV tried for the unedited version, but the master of the audio and video could not be located to synchronize, so the edited version it is. There is also the belief that copyright played a role in using the edited version, as well. However, one episode in the grand scheme of things is not bad!",5,Intelligence is *not* completely dead!,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,2845,"['era', 'when', 'MTV', 'still', 'gave', 'crap', 'not', 'pandering', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'programming', 'was', 'Daria', '.The', 'irony', 'Daria', 'was', 'spun', 'off', 'ridiculous', 'admittedly', 'amusing', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'series', 'Where', 'show', 'gleefully', 'wallowed', 'stupid', 'moronic', 'Daria', 'went', 'opposite', 'direction', 'Using', 'sarcasm', 'commentary', 'general', 'cynicism', 'show', 'showed', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'intelligent', 'blunt', 'still', 'be', 'entertaining', 'way', 'show', 'usual', 'crap', 'being', 'teen', 'being', 'preachy', 'moralistic', 'boring', 'assumed', 'audience', 'was', 'smart', 'Which', 'MTV', 'obviously', 'no', 'longer', 'does.Admittedly', 'am', 'not', 'demographic', 'show', '30s', 'smart', 'show', 'smart', 'show', 'have', 'waited', 'series', 'ages', 'long', 'past', 'time', 'series', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'will', 'make', 'remember', 'when', 'MTV', 'was', 'relevant', 'socially', 'aware', 'treated', 'young', 'people', 'thinking', 'beings', 'not', 'Barbie', 'Ken', 'dolls', 'reality', 'TV', 'crap', 'think', 'one', 'smart', 'shows', 'edge', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'Daria', 'regardless', 'age', 'Ironically', 'think', 'character', 'Daria', 'existed', 'naturally', 'would', 'have', 'plenty', 'say', 'state', 'channel', 'today', 'originated', 'none', 'good', 'LOL', 'downside', 'am', '99.999', '%', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'music', 'deletions', 'substitutions', 'dreaded', 'rights', 'issues', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'intact', 'guess', 'could', 'see', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'cost', 'prohibitive', 'series', 'too', 'good', 'sit', 'vault', 'Which', 'why', 'still', 'give', 'DVD', 'set', 'five', 'stars', 'regardless', 'issue', 'So', 'will', 'live', 'music', 'changes', 'complain', 'Daria', 'would', 'be', 'pleased', 'short', 'like', 'animation', 'wit', 'fun', 'intelligence', 'snark', 'plenty', 'let', 'Daria', 'entertain', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'smarter', 'it.Edited', 'add', 'have', 'answered', 'review', 'comment', 'link', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'readily', 'seen', 'Daria', 'Musical', 'episode', '*is*', 'included', 'DVD', 'set', 'making', 'advertised', 'complete', 'series', 'production', 'number', 'was', '301', 'however', 'MTV', 'used', 'Lens', 'Darkly', 'Season', '3', 'premiere', 'years', 'ago', 'DVD', 'order', 'same', 'way', 'Daria', 'Musical', 'episode', '7', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'one', 'episode', 'retaining', 'original', 'end', 'music', 'alter', 'egos/credits.Also', 'regrettably', 'College', 'Yet', 'again', 'edited', 'version', 'account', 'here', 'discussion', 'thread', 'regarding', 'set', 'MTV', 'tried', 'unedited', 'version', 'master', 'audio', 'video', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'located', 'synchronize', 'edited', 'version', 'also', 'belief', 'copyright', 'played', 'role', 'using', 'edited', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'one', 'episode', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'not', 'bad']",Daria: The Complete Animated Series
