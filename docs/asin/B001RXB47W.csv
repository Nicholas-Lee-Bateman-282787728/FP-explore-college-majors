""Heartflight Studios""","[1, 1]","Would have been nice to have Lou Gramm back with Foreigner, but hey, Kelly Hansen does an excellent job of taking Lou's place. It's nice to see groups like Foreigner, Journey etc. continue to give us their great music with diffrent lead singers. This concert DVD is no exception. Great sound and picture quality and song selection. Kellys voice is clean and over the top and must have cloned Lou's voice. If you have seen them in person, even better. These guy's kick it from the first note and put on one awesome show. Nice to see them together and playing their hit's. Also on this DVD, they've mixed in some new music. Foreigner music is timeless and always will be, whether with Lou or Kelly........... get it and you won't be disapointed.

Lay ""panamax""","[29, 31]","I am one of those who believe that rock bands once losing their original vocalist or its original sound is like the equivalent to the 80's fiasco of the New Coke, it if ain't broke don't fix it.However, after seeing this concert I was impressed with how good is Kelly Hansen as Foreigner's new singer and frontman.If you watch the concert with your eyes closes, you could truly swear it is Lou Gramm you are hearing, this is how good Hansen is in recreating the vocal presence that Gramm stamped on the Foreigner sound.  Hansen's performance is so true to Gramm's that it is impressive.Hansen performance in this incarnation of Foreigner is so autenthic that even the new song (Too Late) sounds as if Lou Gramm could have recorded it, this is how good he is at impersonating Gramm's vocals.Regarding the audio, video and production, Soundstage has improved a lot in this concert from other past offerings.  They have been doing their homework.Regarding the material, the set list was very good although there were several classics missing, the inclusion of Soul Doctor and That Was Yesterday would have made it perfect.The DVD version has 4 more songs than the Blu-ray version, most importantingly Juke Box Hero.Eventhough I broke my rule of endorsing the Real McCoy, this Foreigner is as good as it gets, and you will truly enjoy this performance.",4,Pleasantly Surprised,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,1348,"['am', 'one', 'who', 'believe', 'rock', 'bands', 'once', 'losing', 'original', 'vocalist', 'original', 'sound', 'equivalent', '80', 'fiasco', 'New', 'Coke', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'it.However', 'seeing', 'concert', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'good', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'Foreigner', 'new', 'singer', 'frontman.If', 'watch', 'concert', 'eyes', 'closes', 'could', 'truly', 'swear', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'are', 'hearing', 'how', 'good', 'Hansen', 'recreating', 'vocal', 'presence', 'Gramm', 'stamped', 'Foreigner', 'sound', 'Hansen', 'performance', 'so', 'true', 'Gramm', 'impressive.Hansen', 'performance', 'incarnation', 'Foreigner', 'so', 'autenthic', 'even', 'new', 'song', 'Too', 'Late', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'could', 'have', 'recorded', 'how', 'good', 'impersonating', 'Gramm', 'vocals.Regarding', 'audio', 'video', 'production', 'Soundstage', 'improved', 'lot', 'concert', 'other', 'past', 'offerings', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'homework.Regarding', 'material', 'set', 'list', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'several', 'classics', 'missing', 'inclusion', 'Soul', 'Doctor', 'Was', 'Yesterday', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect.The', 'DVD', 'version', '4', 'more', 'songs', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'most', 'importantingly', 'Juke', 'Box', 'Hero.Eventhough', 'broke', 'rule', 'endorsing', 'Real', 'McCoy', 'Foreigner', 'as', 'good', 'will', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'performance']",N/A

Then as I'm walking downstairs to my theater with my ice cold soda, it took all of two seconds to realize that something was not kosher. I couldn't even see the screen yet but I could tell that was NOT Lou Gram singing! This is a great concert if you have never heard Foreigner or even Lou's solo stuff before , as the band is tight and the singer is very good. The sound is of a well recorded cover band. The reason it sounds like a cover band is due entirely to the fact that the single most recognizable sound of the group is absent. So my recommendation is this. If you're not familiar with Foreigner, buy this disk. The music is good quality , the band is very good. Then rush out and buy one of there original cd's. Then you'll see what I'm talking about , Without Lou's vocals this is a good tribute band.

Plus, I have always been a big Lou Gramm fan.  I bought the prior DVD, shelved it without watching.  But, this one looked more interesting to me anyway being that it was a full set.  So, I put it in... hit play... and WOW.  The vocals stand out right away... they are great.  Kelly hits EVERYTHING that Lou could and even seems to have more control when compared to older Foreigner live recordings.  Kelly even sounds like Lou at times, which was always something I was concerned about because I felt Lou was rather unique and hard to duplicate.  In any event, the vocals steal the show here... they are great.  The guitar is great as well.  Pretty much every piece is top notch.  They added themselves to the list of bands I want to see live now.  Another great thing about this superb DVD is the stage.  Foreigner make great use of lighting and video screens on this to an effect that make it interesting to watch beyond just a good sounding performance.  It really has everything you could ask for in a live DVD and instantly vaulted into one of my favorite live DVDs of all (and I have MANY of them). If you love Foreigner, OBVIOUSLY, you NEED this.  If you only casually like Foreinger, you NEED this... because after watching this.... you will like them way more than casually!  I had my 19 year old son watch it with me and he was impressed too not only in how good the performance is, but in how many Foreigner songs he liked and never knew were their songs.

I wasn't sure about Lou Gramm being out of the band, but after watching this I'm sold! Solid performance, great sound and great camera work and visuals. A great concert package!!Fantastic live concert from Foreigner. Despite the fact that Mick Jones is the only original member of this band, he is backed up by the thunderous rhythm section of Jason Bonham on drums and former Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson. Handling vocals is Kelly Hansen, who is the perfect choice to replace the incredible Lou Gramm. One of the thing s I really enjoyed about this performance was how they rearranged some of the songs, usually with extended instrumental sections. And I'm not a big fan of acoustic versions of rock songs, because they are usually the same, just unplugged, but on this DVD, they rearrange Say You Will and turn it into the finest version I've ever heard of this song! The added harmony vocals and simple acoustic guitar and piano arrangement really work!

The camera crew filmed the concert pretty much straight on and the way it should be with some minor shots of the crowd here and there. The concert picture is fantastic, it's crystal clear and the stage set lighting is incredible to say the least. The concert sound is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and it absolutely rocks! Running time for the concert is approximately 105 minutes the picture's Aspect Ratio is: 1.77:1 and 16x9 anamorphic.Soundstage presents ""Foreigner"" live 2008 like you've never seen or heard them before or have you? After seeing this concert on PBS channel 56 out of Detroit I was so impressed with the show I knew I had to have it. I've been a fan of ""Foreigner"" for over 30 years and now that Kelly Hansen is Foreigner's new singer and front man the band has never sounded better! As a rock purist part of me say's this isn't the real Foreigner without Lou Gramm but let's face it Lou Gramm can't sing anymore. He can't hit the high notes that made him famous like he used to and his vocal range is pretty much gone.To the Foreigner purists who have doubts about Kelly Hansen's vocal ability all I can say is watch the concert with your eyes closed or go into another room and just listen to the music. Kelly's vocals are so great that you'll think you're hearing a young Lou Gramm singing even though he isn't. This is the reason why Mick Jones recruited Kelly in the first place and this live concert proves how dynamic Kelly Hansen is in preserving the distinct Foreigner sound we've all come to love over the years.The massive 16-song set list spanning the bands entire career was recorded live for this PBS Soundstage concert series and it includes 6 more tracks not shown in the original broadcast so fans will definitely get their monies worth with this one. The addition of Kelly Hansen as singer, the showmanship and level of musicianship by the entire band proves that ""Foreigner"" is just as powerful and dynamic than ever. As much as I miss Lou Gramm I really loved everything about this concert.Songs Include: Night Life, Head Games, Cold As Ice, Waiting For A Girl Like You, Too Late, Say You Will, Long Long Way From Home, Double Vision, Blue Morning Blue Day, Dirty White Boy, Starrider, Feels Like The First Time, Urgent, Juke Box Hero, I Want To Know What Love Is, Hot Blooded",5,SOME TIMES CHANGE IS A GOOD THING !,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,2500,"['live', '2008', 'concert', 'Foreigner', 'was', 'captured', 'High-Definition', 'using', 'best', 'equipment', 'possible', 'Soundstage', 'crew', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'camera', 'editing', 'work', 'camera', 'crew', 'filmed', 'concert', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'minor', 'shots', 'crowd', 'here', 'there', 'concert', 'picture', 'fantastic', 'crystal', 'clear', 'stage', 'set', 'lighting', 'incredible', 'say', 'least', 'concert', 'sound', 'presented', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'absolutely', 'Running', 'time', 'concert', 'approximately', '105', 'minutes', 'picture', 'Aspect', 'Ratio', '1.77:1', '16x9', 'anamorphic.Soundstage', 'presents', 'Foreigner', 'live', '2008', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'have', 'seeing', 'concert', 'PBS', 'channel', '56', 'Detroit', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'show', 'knew', 'had', 'have', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Foreigner', '30', 'years', 'now', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'Foreigner', 'new', 'singer', 'front', 'man', 'band', 'never', 'sounded', 'better', 'rock', 'purist', 'part', 'say', ""n't"", 'real', 'Foreigner', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'let', 'face', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'anymore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'made', 'famous', 'used', 'vocal', 'range', 'pretty', 'much', 'Foreigner', 'purists', 'who', 'have', 'doubts', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'vocal', 'ability', 'can', 'say', 'concert', 'eyes', 'closed', 'go', 'room', 'just', 'listen', 'music', 'Kelly', 'vocals', 'are', 'so', 'great', ""'ll"", 'think', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'young', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'singing', 'even', ""n't"", 'reason', 'why', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'recruited', 'Kelly', 'first', 'place', 'live', 'concert', 'how', 'dynamic', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'preserving', 'distinct', 'Foreigner', 'sound', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'years.The', 'massive', '16-song', 'set', 'list', 'spanning', 'bands', 'entire', 'career', 'was', 'recorded', 'live', 'PBS', 'Soundstage', 'concert', 'series', '6', 'more', 'tracks', 'not', 'shown', 'original', 'broadcast', 'so', 'fans', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'monies', 'one', 'addition', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'singer', 'showmanship', 'level', 'musicianship', 'entire', 'band', 'Foreigner', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'dynamic', 'ever', 'As', 'much', 'miss', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'really', 'loved', 'everything', 'concert.Songs', 'Include', 'Night', 'Life', 'Head', 'Games', 'Cold', 'Ice', 'Waiting', 'A', 'Girl', 'Too', 'Late', 'Say', 'Will', 'Long', 'Long', 'Way', 'From', 'Home', 'Double', 'Vision', 'Blue', 'Morning', 'Blue', 'Day', 'Dirty', 'White', 'Boy', 'Starrider', 'Feels', 'First', 'Time', 'Urgent', 'Juke', 'Box', 'Hero', 'Want', 'Know', 'What', 'Love', 'Hot', 'Blooded']",N/A
