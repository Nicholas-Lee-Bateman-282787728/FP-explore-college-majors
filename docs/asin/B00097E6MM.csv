While there, he come into contact with some Christian students, and from the testimony of their life, he converts to Christianity.  When he returns to his country, he has to face all the Islamic consequences for Muslims who become Christians (or any other religion).  Samir's father, rather than kill him, disowns him; however, his uncles are out to kidnap him for forced 'reconversion' to Islam; if he then refuses, the plan to kill him.At the same time, a Christian pastor in his country is imprisoned and it is a foregone conclusion that his trial will result in his martyrdom.  Other Christians in the country, through smuggling means with a Frenchman, are bringing Bibles and taking developments of the pastor's situation out for news sources in the West.  Samir, with no place to stay and no money finds the secret Christian group, and after a period of mistrust of him (thinking he is a secret police spy), let him join the group.  With his life in grave danger, Samir also sees the great need of the Christians in his country, so, when it comes time for him to return to Chicago, he has a difficult decision to make.This movie may be distributed by the Christiano Film Group, but it is produced by Open Doors, International, and is far, far above the quality of the Christiano produced movies.  Not only is it a much more professional quality, it doesn't beat you over the head with ""Christianity"" like the Christiano movies do.  In this movie, the drama is paramount; it lets the Christian message come through simply by the example of the lives of the Christian characters.  Indeed, it also shows a Muslim cousin of Samir risking his life to help his cousin.If you are looking for a movie that will cause you to tense up from the danger to the main character, one that shows the risks of Christians in an Islamic country, and one that subtly gets its Christian message across without offending, then you will really like this movie.  In my opinion, this movie is as good or better than the best of the Billy Graham organization's movies.",5,Story of a Young Muslim Who Converts to Christianity,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,2143,"['movie', 'Muslim', 'Samir', 'unnamed', 'Islamic', 'country', 'university', 'Chicago', 'there', 'come', 'contact', 'Christian', 'students', 'testimony', 'life', 'Christianity', 'When', 'country', 'face', 'Islamic', 'consequences', 'Muslims', 'who', 'become', 'Christians', 'other', 'religion', 'Samir', 'father', 'rather', 'kill', 'however', 'uncles', 'are', 'kidnap', 'forced', ""'reconversion"", 'Islam', 'then', 'plan', 'kill', 'same', 'time', 'Christian', 'pastor', 'country', 'imprisoned', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'trial', 'will', 'result', 'martyrdom', 'Other', 'Christians', 'country', 'smuggling', 'means', 'Frenchman', 'are', 'bringing', 'Bibles', 'taking', 'developments', 'pastor', 'situation', 'news', 'sources', 'West', 'Samir', 'place', 'stay', 'money', 'secret', 'Christian', 'group', 'period', 'mistrust', 'thinking', 'secret', 'police', 'spy', 'let', 'join', 'group', 'life', 'grave', 'danger', 'Samir', 'also', 'great', 'need', 'Christians', 'country', 'so', 'when', 'time', 'return', 'Chicago', 'difficult', 'decision', 'make.This', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'distributed', 'Christiano', 'Film', 'Group', 'produced', 'Open', 'Doors', 'International', 'far', 'far', 'quality', 'Christiano', 'produced', 'movies', 'Not', 'only', 'much', 'more', 'professional', 'quality', ""n't"", 'beat', 'head', 'Christianity', 'Christiano', 'movies', 'do', 'movie', 'drama', 'paramount', 'Christian', 'message', 'come', 'simply', 'example', 'lives', 'Christian', 'characters', 'Indeed', 'also', 'Muslim', 'cousin', 'Samir', 'risking', 'life', 'help', 'cousin.If', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'will', 'cause', 'tense', 'up', 'danger', 'main', 'character', 'one', 'risks', 'Christians', 'Islamic', 'country', 'one', 'subtly', 'Christian', 'message', 'offending', 'then', 'will', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'opinion', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'best', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'organization', 'movies']",Behind the Sun

Samir has a career and a girlfriend in the US, but has traveled back to the Middle East to visit his family and share with them the good news of Jesus.  Things don't go as exactly planned, and the movie recounts the persecution not just of Samir, but of the local underground church comprised of Christians from an Islamic background.  It's significant that the film distinguished between the above-ground, tolerated church comprised of historically Christian Arabs sort of ""grandfathered into"" Christianity and so tolerated, versus the underground church consisting of converts from Islam.Though BEHIND THE SUN is a rather simple story, I'm rating it highly because of its importance as a reminder to not forget our suffering brothers, plus the story, uncomplicated though it is, is of high quality in presentation.  Also, all Christians should be able to relate to the protagonist's experience on some level, anyway, since the Bible promises persecution to all who live godly in Christ Jesus.  4.5 stars",5,Persecution of Ex-Muslim for Christ's Sake...,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,1106,"['sun', 'where', 'Samir', 'family', 'send', ""n't"", 'renounce', 'Christianity', 'Samir', 'career', 'girlfriend', 'US', 'traveled', 'back', 'Middle', 'East', 'visit', 'family', 'share', 'good', 'news', 'Jesus', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'exactly', 'planned', 'movie', 'persecution', 'not', 'just', 'Samir', 'local', 'underground', 'church', 'comprised', 'Christians', 'Islamic', 'background', 'significant', 'film', 'distinguished', 'above-ground', 'tolerated', 'church', 'comprised', 'historically', 'Christian', 'Arabs', 'sort', 'grandfathered', 'Christianity', 'so', 'tolerated', 'underground', 'church', 'consisting', 'converts', 'Islam.Though', 'BEHIND', 'THE', 'SUN', 'rather', 'simple', 'story', ""'m"", 'rating', 'highly', 'importance', 'reminder', 'not', 'forget', 'suffering', 'brothers', 'story', 'uncomplicated', 'high', 'quality', 'presentation', 'Also', 'Christians', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'protagonist', 'experience', 'level', 'anyway', 'Bible', 'persecution', 'who', 'live', 'godly', 'Christ', 'Jesus', '4.5', 'stars']",Behind the Sun
902569,A329ALHKYK62O7,B00097E6MM,Ky. Col.,"[3, 4]","""Behind the Sun"" presents the story of Sameer, an American educated young Middle Eastern man going home to pay a visit to his family in an unnamed Arab country.  What he doesn't initially tell them (but they soon find out) is that Sameer has converted to Christianity and thus commited one of the worst offenses in Islam (apostacy).  Needless to say attitudes quickly change and Sameer becomes an outcast.  The short film illustrates the discrimmination and persecution including family violence that many Christians (and especially Christian converts) face in numerous Islamic nations.  A sidestory in the film (which becomes quite important) deals with a Middle Eastern pastor who smuggles bibles while avoiding the secret police and who desperately wants to get word out to the outside world of a Christian pastor who will otherwise be executed.  While I believe this is set in an Arab nation I have a feeling this aspect of the film was influenced by the case of an imprisoned Iranian pastor named Dibaj in the early 1990s.  One positive aspect of the film in my view is that the actors portraying Middle Easterners generally look Middle Eastern (and I am pretty certain some definantly had heritage in the region).  The film also features generally good acting and suspense; therefore it doesn't just tell an important story but is a very watchable film as well.  The cinematography is okay but not great and I wish the movie was longer to go into more depth.  However, I think the film's positive qualities vastly outweigh the negative.  From what I've read dealing with Christian persecution in the Middle East, the film is quite accurate and deals as well with the honor-shame aspect of society so prevelant in the Arab world.  The charity organization Open Doors which helps persecuted Christians apparently was responsible for the film which may account for the accuracy and plausibility of the situations depicted.Overall a very good and moving film that I highly recommend.  It can help make one appreciate the degree of religious freedom in the United States.",5,Gripping and very Accurate,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,2072,"['Sun', 'story', 'Sameer', 'American', 'educated', 'young', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'man', 'going', 'home', 'pay', 'visit', 'family', 'unnamed', 'Arab', 'country', 'What', ""n't"", 'initially', 'tell', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'Sameer', 'converted', 'Christianity', 'thus', 'commited', 'one', 'worst', 'offenses', 'Islam', 'apostacy', 'Needless', 'say', 'attitudes', 'quickly', 'change', 'Sameer', 'outcast', 'short', 'film', 'discrimmination', 'persecution', 'including', 'family', 'violence', 'many', 'Christians', 'especially', 'Christian', 'converts', 'face', 'numerous', 'Islamic', 'nations', 'sidestory', 'film', 'quite', 'important', 'deals', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'pastor', 'who', 'bibles', 'avoiding', 'secret', 'police', 'who', 'desperately', 'get', 'word', 'outside', 'world', 'Christian', 'pastor', 'who', 'will', 'otherwise', 'be', 'executed', 'believe', 'set', 'Arab', 'nation', 'have', 'feeling', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'influenced', 'case', 'imprisoned', 'Iranian', 'pastor', 'named', 'Dibaj', 'early', '1990s', 'One', 'positive', 'aspect', 'film', 'view', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Middle', 'Easterners', 'generally', 'look', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'am', 'pretty', 'certain', 'definantly', 'had', 'heritage', 'region', 'film', 'also', 'generally', 'good', 'acting', 'suspense', ""n't"", 'just', 'tell', 'important', 'story', 'very', 'watchable', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'longer', 'go', 'more', 'depth', 'However', 'think', 'film', 'positive', 'qualities', 'vastly', 'outweigh', 'negative', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'dealing', 'Christian', 'persecution', 'Middle', 'East', 'film', 'quite', 'accurate', 'deals', 'as', 'well', 'honor-shame', 'aspect', 'society', 'so', 'prevelant', 'Arab', 'world', 'charity', 'organization', 'Open', 'Doors', 'persecuted', 'Christians', 'apparently', 'was', 'responsible', 'film', 'may', 'account', 'accuracy', 'plausibility', 'situations', 'depicted.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'moving', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'can', 'help', 'make', 'one', 'appreciate', 'degree', 'religious', 'freedom', 'United', 'States']",Behind the Sun
