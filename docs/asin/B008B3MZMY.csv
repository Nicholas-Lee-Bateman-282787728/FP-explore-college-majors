1549400,A2XX6RRHTQ9TTR,B008B3MZMY,Balisani,"[1, 1]","This was filmed over a couple (maybe three) consecutive days in Paris in 1979.  Consequently, the film crew did not capture a handful of songs which do appear on the live album. Fortunately for us, it did capture other songs which were strangely omitted from the album (like Goodbye Stranger, for instance).Poor Bob Siebenberg is hardly featured (the crew could not find many open shots through his cymbals), and Dougie Thompson is featured on some songs and not at all in others.  The other three members and frontmen/singers are well captured and the editing is as thoughtful as I've ever seen from a concert show.The audio is pristine. The bass might be slightly over emphasized for my taste (and I'm a great fan of low end in general and of the instrument in particular) but that is probably because I was listening on professional equipment and the audio must have been mixed for the average home theater listening environment.  I switched to the TV and home theater speakers for the last three songs and the audio balance required no EQ-ing whatsoever.  I can't say I fault the production for this decision; it makes sense.The video quality varies: it's a film transfer obviously, and the lighting was concert lighting in 1979, but overall, shots are clear and well framed. Don't expect 4K quality (or UHD as it's going to be called) or even HD quality visuals, but that's not the point here.The missing songs are included in this disc with accompanying &#34;videos&#34; (just a bunch of graphics stringed together), but it's a nice touch nonetheless, for those who might not have had the Live Album in the first place.At the end of the show are stills of the band members, and a brief update with links to their personal websites for biographies.  Also a nice touch.Highly recommended, for Supertramp fans of course, but also for fans of just a couple of their songs or of beautiful music, simply put.

Temper your expectations.  The audio restoration was well done but showed its age as well from time to time.  Remember, the multi tracks are very old.  You can only do so much with it.  There is a moment where this was evident in a bonus audio track.  I believe it was in the last 30 seconds of From Now On.  Either Rick's voice was breaking unnaturally there or it was the tape.  I'm not sure which.  Looking past these few minor quibbles, the whole thing is a very satisfying experience and a must have.  A true holy grail as others have mentioned.  :)Update: I just discovered that my copy does not have DTS 5.1 audio at all.  You press the option for it and all you get is the picture and no sound.

Having seen the band several times (pre ""Breakfast""), I knew they were an incredible live act, but quality video footage has been a rarity (or perhaps non-entity: there's the broadcast of the ""last concert with Roger Hodgson"" that's been floating around for years, but the sound and picture are nothing to write home about). The ""Live in Paris"" album has been a favorite of mine for years - a great live rendering of the band just at the cusp of superstardom. However, I had no idea the show had been filmed. And instead of this being released in some shoddy manner, the producers have remastered the film and soundtrack, providing a simply classic piece of concert memorabilia of a great band at the top of their game. The sound (in particular the 5.1 DTS) is stunning for a show now 34 years old - and the picture quality is equally as pristine. It wasn't long before Roger would become disillusioned with the direction of Supertramp and quit the proceedings, and what followed the mega ""Breakfast in America"" album after this tour was a series of forgettable records and the entire break-up of the band. That all makes this an even better find. While it's unfortunate that five of the songs from the Paris concert were never filmed, ""Fool's Overture"" and ""Child of Vision"" (not to mention nearly the entire ""Crime of the Century"" album) are worth the price of admission alone!",5,"Adding to the chorus of ""Wow's""!!",1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,1490,"['Just', 'when', 'think', 'great', 'vintage', 'show', 'been', 'uncovered', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Supertramp-dom', 'Having', 'seen', 'band', 'several', 'times', 'Breakfast', 'knew', 'were', 'incredible', 'live', 'act', 'quality', 'video', 'footage', 'been', 'rarity', 'perhaps', 'non-entity', 'broadcast', 'last', 'concert', 'Roger', 'Hodgson', 'been', 'floating', 'years', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'Live', 'Paris', 'album', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'years', 'great', 'live', 'rendering', 'band', 'just', 'cusp', 'superstardom', 'However', 'had', 'idea', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'instead', 'being', 'released', 'shoddy', 'manner', 'producers', 'have', 'remastered', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'providing', 'simply', 'classic', 'piece', 'concert', 'memorabilia', 'great', 'band', 'top', 'game', 'sound', 'particular', '5.1', 'DTS', 'stunning', 'show', 'now', '34', 'years', 'old', 'picture', 'quality', 'equally', 'pristine', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Roger', 'would', 'become', 'disillusioned', 'direction', 'Supertramp', 'quit', 'proceedings', 'followed', 'mega', 'Breakfast', 'America', 'album', 'tour', 'was', 'series', 'forgettable', 'records', 'entire', 'break-up', 'band', 'even', 'better', 'find', 'unfortunate', 'five', 'songs', 'Paris', 'concert', 'were', 'never', 'filmed', 'Fool', 'Overture', 'Child', 'Vision', 'not', 'mention', 'nearly', 'entire', 'Crime', 'Century', 'album', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'alone']",N/A

It was a promotion by one of our Record Stores (known back then as ""The Record Warehouse""). The deal was the album was played live on a huge sound system in our main Central Square (from memory a couple of thousand of people turned up). It was at night, no visuals just listening to the entire album. If you liked it you could walk back up the road to the Record Store and buy it for a special one off price ($12.99 fom memory). We listened, we loved it, we went back and bought it.32 years later along comes the DVD (which was recorded at the same venue as the album, just a couple of days later).I have just finished watching it last night, and all I can say is.... FANTASTIC. These guys were brilliant, fantastic musicians and composers...from 1974 to 1979, four great albums, what a show and fantastic set list to close out 1979.If you like Supertramp and / or enjoy great music with great melodies and vocals played by great musicians this is a 100% no risc disc.I really enjoyed this, if it sounds remotely like you I think you'd enjoy it too.",5,32 Years later...

Pearson,"[37, 38]","I had long given up on seeing a DVD live concert of Supertramp and was prepared to relive the one DVD worth seeing ""The Story So Far"".I was wandering through my local ""The Warehouse"" store in Auckland today and caught a glimpse of the DVD cover in the rack. The Paris Live concert was there for $18.99 NZ and I saw that it was a 1979 concert that had gone through some degree of restoration. The track listing was impressive and I said to myself - ""you have to have it"".One of the early reviewers has summed it up pretty well in saying that for its age, the video and audio quality are surprisingly good. The picture fills the entire screen of my HD TV (ie. not a 4:3 ratio picture). The long distance shots may be a bit grainy but there are not many of these and the lighting for the close up shots is very good which provides favourable conditions for the older cameras to capture a nice clear picture (but do not expect HD quality of course).I have the 1981 Journey ""Escape"" concert and the mid 80's Dire Straits ""Alchemy"" concert and the picture and sound quality of the Supertramp ""Paris"" concert is better than these, the video is certainly better.For those who have a good home theatre system, you will get a nice thump from the drums through the sub. There is a full band for this concert (unlike Roger's later concert with just himself and the saxophonist).The big hits from the ""Breakfast In America"" concert sound very much like the CD (the ""Child Of Vision"" song has a slightly different arrangement when it gets to the long instrumental second half) and overall, this DVD had me spellbound in the chair!I was really impressed to hear and see the ten minute long ""Fool's Overture"". This was terrific to see live.Overall, if you have the 'Story Ss Far"" and then buy this DVD, you will have a relatively complete history of Supertramp.

Dean,"[3, 3]","The picture quality and sound on this release are quite good, I didn't know what to expect after hearing how old the source tape was and that it needed painstaking restoration. Also appealing was that the show was a different show than the one recorded for the original Paris LP release. The addition of songs not on that release, especially a favorite of mine, ""Child Of Vision"", was a welcome surprise.I got into Supertramp relatively late, that being after they released ""Breakfast In America"", but that was 34 years ago (has it really been 34 years?). I saw them in Houston at the Summit for their ""Famous Last Words"" tour and also for the following ""Brother Where You Bound?"" tour, sans Roger Hodgson. I always preferred Rick Davies to Roger Hodgson and I am most likely in the minority there, but Supertramp works best with both of them. They traded songs and the juxtaposition of the two, with Rick being cynical and Roger being the exact opposite was what made the band and the music work. Another reason I liked Rick singing was because that usually put Roger on guitar and he was a very underrated guitar player.I only have two minor quibbles about this release. One, I didn't like the black screen between numbers, it ruined the flow of the concert. Two, Bob Siebenberg was barely shown, just briefly a couple of times. I realize that Rick & Roger were going to get the bulk of the attention and John Anthony Helliwell would be out front, but Bob's drumming is a big part of Supertramp and was certainly front and center at both shows that I attended. I did like that Dougie Thomson got some airtime on the bass, his playing was excellent for this show, as per usual.",5,Bloody Well Right,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,1678,"['picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'release', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'hearing', 'how', 'old', 'source', 'tape', 'was', 'needed', 'painstaking', 'restoration', 'Also', 'appealing', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'different', 'show', 'one', 'recorded', 'original', 'Paris', 'LP', 'release', 'addition', 'songs', 'not', 'release', 'especially', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Child', 'Vision', 'was', 'welcome', 'surprise.I', 'got', 'Supertramp', 'relatively', 'late', 'being', 'released', 'Breakfast', 'America', 'was', '34', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'been', '34', 'years', 'saw', 'Houston', 'Summit', 'Famous', 'Last', 'Words', 'tour', 'also', 'following', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Bound', 'tour', 'sans', 'Roger', 'Hodgson', 'always', 'preferred', 'Rick', 'Davies', 'Roger', 'Hodgson', 'am', 'most', 'likely', 'minority', 'there', 'Supertramp', 'best', 'traded', 'songs', 'juxtaposition', 'two', 'Rick', 'being', 'cynical', 'Roger', 'being', 'exact', 'opposite', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'band', 'music', 'work', 'reason', 'liked', 'Rick', 'singing', 'was', 'usually', 'put', 'Roger', 'guitar', 'was', 'very', 'underrated', 'guitar', 'player.I', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'release', 'One', 'did', ""n't"", 'black', 'screen', 'numbers', 'ruined', 'flow', 'concert', 'Two', 'Bob', 'Siebenberg', 'was', 'barely', 'shown', 'just', 'briefly', 'couple', 'times', 'realize', 'Rick', 'Roger', 'were', 'going', 'get', 'bulk', 'attention', 'John', 'Anthony', 'Helliwell', 'would', 'be', 'out', 'front', 'Bob', 'drumming', 'big', 'part', 'Supertramp', 'was', 'certainly', 'front', 'center', 'shows', 'attended', 'did', 'Dougie', 'Thomson', 'got', 'airtime', 'bass', 'playing', 'was', 'excellent', 'show', 'usual']",N/A

1549419,A1MHTHU9A6OFN3,B008B3MZMY,"JP ""ZappaFan""","[3, 5]","An edit - I am beginning to realize that the ""absurdly grainy picture"" may be only coming from film shot by one camera. The one in the center of the rear of the arena. That would explain some of the below picture problems.Yep, this Supertramp Bluray works fine on my American Sony player. (Relief!) I have known for decades that this concert was filmed so have always been disappointed that it was never released on VHS or, later, DVD. So I was quite excited when I learned that it was finally being released, and as a BluRay with DTS HD sound to boot!! My one concern?...it was an import!!As I posted on the comments of some of these other reviews, region coding isn't the only thing you have to worry about, there's also the format, PAL vs. NTSC. We use the latter, Europe uses the former, and regional coding is just another kind of copyguard. So just telling me it's region 0, without telling me the format of the disc itself, is no guarantee at all.In fact I have  dozen import concert (regular) DVDs, and a few movies, that I was guaranteed would work because they were region 0, but when they arrived I discovered that, yep, they were PAL format and wouldn't work in any of my players. Of course there are multi-format players available (and for under $100 too!) and there's also software that will convert and burn onto a DVDr, which is what I did for the other DVDs. Of course, with a BluRay I can't do that (yet)!But I went ahead and purchased it after one reviewer assured me that he actually owned the BluRay and it worked fine (so thanks Neil!)On to the review.........First thing - the DTS HD sounds AWESOME!! One of the more drastic improvements over PCM stereo I have heard yet (there is no Dolby track). Of course DTS is almost always an improvement over other sound formats but it's usually a matter of ""opening up"" the soundscape or adding ""punch"" to the sound. In this case it's almost like my tweeters aren't even working in stereo mode. There is a considerable boost in high range when using the DTS HD.DARN grainy picture though. Weird, especially considering the source was film, which I can only assume has deteriorated (and they didn't want to pay for a ""Hollywood-level"" restoration)!! Can't really tell in brightly lit scenes, like close ups of band members, but BAD in low light scenes. Especially those taken from the cameras at the back of the venue.I can also do without what I call the ""artsy fartsy"" visuals, like playing movies while the songs are playing (an old B&W; train sequence over the middle of Rudy for example). I never have liked that, just show me the darn concert, that's what I paid for!!Or at least give me the feature to turn it off!! (A perfect example of this is Yes' 9021Live DVD which allows you to remove the visuals and animation and just watch the ""raw"" concert footage.)There are also 5 songs that were recorded on one of the other nights, not the night that was filmed (probably the same audio tracks that are on the CD). They added them as bonus tracks with newly created visual animation. While it's nice they included them, I am slightly disappointed because I was looking forward to ""seeing"" Ain't Nobody but Me, You Started Laughing and From Now On.But we all know many bands vary their setlists from night to night. And the DVD does have several tracks not on the album/CD, including Goodbye Stranger, Give a Little Bit and Another Man's Woman.Bottom line - despite the grainy picture, and speaking as a long-time Supertramp fan who counts the (now 32 year-old) album of this among his top-20 all time favorite live albums, this BluRay is definitely worth it to me, even at the import price!Oh - and shipping from England was under 2 weeks!",5,"AWESOME sound, sometimes grainy picture = still worth it to me",1349308800,"10 4, 2012",2012,3706,"['edit', 'am', 'beginning', 'realize', 'absurdly', 'grainy', 'picture', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'coming', 'film', 'shot', 'one', 'camera', 'one', 'center', 'rear', 'arena', 'would', 'explain', 'below', 'picture', 'problems.Yep', 'Supertramp', 'Bluray', 'fine', 'American', 'Sony', 'player', 'Relief', 'have', 'known', 'decades', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'so', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'disappointed', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'VHS', 'later', 'DVD', 'So', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'when', 'learned', 'was', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'BluRay', 'DTS', 'HD', 'sound', 'boot', 'one', 'concern', 'was', 'import', 'posted', 'comments', 'other', 'reviews', 'region', 'coding', ""n't"", 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'worry', 'about', 'also', 'format', 'PAL', 'vs.', 'NTSC', 'use', 'latter', 'Europe', 'former', 'regional', 'coding', 'just', 'kind', 'copyguard', 'So', 'just', 'telling', 'region', '0', 'telling', 'format', 'disc', 'guarantee', 'all.In', 'fact', 'have', 'dozen', 'import', 'concert', 'regular', 'DVDs', 'few', 'movies', 'was', 'guaranteed', 'would', 'work', 'were', 'region', '0', 'when', 'arrived', 'discovered', 'yep', 'were', 'PAL', 'format', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'players', 'course', 'are', 'multi-format', 'players', 'available', '100', 'too', 'also', 'software', 'will', 'convert', 'burn', 'DVDr', 'what', 'did', 'other', 'DVDs', 'course', 'BluRay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'yet', 'went', 'ahead', 'purchased', 'one', 'reviewer', 'assured', 'actually', 'owned', 'BluRay', 'worked', 'fine', 'thanks', 'Neil', 'review', 'First', 'thing', 'DTS', 'HD', 'AWESOME', 'One', 'more', 'drastic', 'improvements', 'PCM', 'stereo', 'have', 'heard', 'yet', 'Dolby', 'track', 'course', 'DTS', 'almost', 'always', 'improvement', 'other', 'sound', 'formats', 'usually', 'matter', 'opening', 'up', 'soundscape', 'adding', 'punch', 'sound', 'case', 'almost', 'tweeters', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'working', 'stereo', 'mode', 'considerable', 'boost', 'high', 'range', 'when', 'using', 'DTS', 'HD.DARN', 'grainy', 'picture', 'Weird', 'especially', 'considering', 'source', 'was', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'deteriorated', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'pay', 'Hollywood-level', 'restoration', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'brightly', 'lit', 'scenes', 'close', 'ups', 'band', 'members', 'BAD', 'low', 'light', 'scenes', 'Especially', 'taken', 'cameras', 'back', 'venue.I', 'can', 'also', 'do', 'what', 'call', 'artsy', 'fartsy', 'visuals', 'playing', 'movies', 'songs', 'are', 'playing', 'old', 'B', 'W', 'train', 'sequence', 'middle', 'Rudy', 'example', 'never', 'have', 'liked', 'just', 'show', 'darn', 'concert', 'what', 'paid', 'least', 'give', 'feature', 'turn', 'off', 'perfect', 'example', 'Yes', '9021Live', 'DVD', 'remove', 'visuals', 'animation', 'just', 'watch', 'raw', 'concert', 'footage', 'are', 'also', '5', 'songs', 'were', 'recorded', 'one', 'other', 'nights', 'not', 'night', 'was', 'filmed', 'probably', 'same', 'audio', 'tracks', 'are', 'CD', 'added', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'newly', 'created', 'visual', 'animation', 'nice', 'included', 'am', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Nobody', 'Me', 'Started', 'Laughing', 'From', 'Now', 'know', 'many', 'bands', 'vary', 'setlists', 'night', 'night', 'DVD', 'have', 'several', 'tracks', 'not', 'album/CD', 'including', 'Goodbye', 'Stranger', 'Give', 'Little', 'Bit', 'Man', 'Woman.Bottom', 'line', 'grainy', 'picture', 'speaking', 'long-time', 'Supertramp', 'fan', 'who', 'now', '32', 'year-old', 'album', 'top-20', 'time', 'favorite', 'live', 'albums', 'BluRay', 'definitely', 'worth', 'even', 'import', 'price', 'Oh', 'shipping', 'England', 'was', '2', 'weeks']",N/A

Nevertheless, the overall product is more than satisfactory.  Nowadays, there is the temptation to overuse digital scrubbing software to clean up old film.  Here is a case where all involved resisted that temptation as there is very little digital scrubbing on this disc.

Reardon ""Classic rock and old sch...","[34, 34]","Supertramp's seventh album entitled Paris was released in October of 1980.Now, a Blu-Ray (and DVD) has been released of the classic Supertramp performances from Paris in December of 1979 called Supertramp Live in Paris 1979.The film was shot and recorded in December of 1979 in Paris, France at the Pavillion on the penultimate night of the band's Breakfast in America European tour. Supertramp Live in Paris is a superb concert film, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity when co-leader/guitarist/singer/keyboard player/songwriter Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days very doubtful, Paris becomes an extremely important live document of the classic lineup of the band, indeed. This concert film had been fabled for years and no footage had been officially released (aside ""The Logical Song"" and ""Dreamer"" as promo films) it wasn't until the master tapes of the December 1, 1979 performance were discovered in drummer Bob Siebenberg's barn in cow dung. Then longtime producer Peter Henderson and old concert sound engineer Russell Pope (whom produced the original album) painstakingly restored and transferred the audio from analog to digital and brilliantly mixed the audio. Then Peter Clifton (the same man who finished Led Zeppelin's The Song Remains the Same after Joe Massot bailed) salvaged the footage shot by Derek Burbidge (who filmed much of The Police's promo videos in the day) and added some bits to round out the film. What is available is a superb document of the classic Supertramp lineup.Many great Supertramp classics are included in this live concert film, such as most of 1974's grand breakthrough Crime of the Century (the spirited opener ""School"", a slightly extended ""Bloody Well Right"", an excellent ""Hide in Your Shell"", a superb ""Asylum', the Top 20 hit ""Dreamer"", a superb ""Rudy"" and the closing ""Crime of the Century"" which closes this live concert film), two songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis? What Crisis? (""Another Man's Woman"" and ""Two of Us"" both superior to studio versions), three from 1977's Gold selling US breakthrough Even in the Quietest Moments (the title cut, ""Give a Little Bit"" and the best version of ""Fool's Overture"" ever which has an ending that is to be seen to believe), and half of the #1 Multi-Platinum selling Breakfast in America (the monster hit ""The Logical Song"", the hit ""Goodbye Stranger"", the title cut, the Top 20 smash ""Take The Long Way Home"" and the epic closer ""Child of Vision"").Hodgson and co-leader/keyboardist/singer/songwriter Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Helliwell on saxophones/clarinets/occasional keyboards and additional backing vocals, drummer Bob C. Benberg and bass player Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson and Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion. Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. The songs on here rival their studio counterparts, especially on Rudy which is sped at faster speed than the studio version on the Roger/Rick vocal duel section and the visuals of the backdrop films are superb.The songs that weren't shot for the film which were recorded (""Ain't Nobody But Me"", ""You Started Laughing"", ""Downstream"", ""A Soapbox Opera"" and ""From Now On"") are here as bonus tracks with visuals created specifically for the DVD/Blu-Ray.Also, much to Roger Hodgson's chagrin, the songwriting credits are printed on the back of the Blu-Ray (may not have been there on the first issue) and the Supertramp fans are just grateful that this classic document of the band's peak is FINALLY AVAILABLE!!!Highly recommended!",5,Supertramp's live document from 1979 is MAGNIFIQUE!,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,3859,"['Supertramp', 'seventh', 'album', 'entitled', 'Paris', 'was', 'released', 'October', '1980.Now', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'been', 'released', 'classic', 'Supertramp', 'performances', 'Paris', 'December', '1979', 'called', 'Supertramp', 'Live', 'Paris', '1979.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'recorded', 'December', '1979', 'Paris', 'France', 'Pavillion', 'penultimate', 'night', 'band', 'Breakfast', 'America', 'European', 'tour', 'Supertramp', 'Live', 'Paris', 'superb', 'concert', 'film', 'capturing', 'band', 'peak', 'popularity', 'when', 'co-leader/guitarist/singer/keyboard', 'player/songwriter', 'Roger', 'Hodgson', 'was', 'still', 'group', 'When', 'consider', 'possibility', 'Hodgson', 'returning', 'Supertramp', 'days', 'very', 'doubtful', 'Paris', 'extremely', 'important', 'live', 'document', 'classic', 'lineup', 'band', 'indeed', 'concert', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'fabled', 'years', 'footage', 'had', 'been', 'officially', 'released', 'Logical', 'Song', 'Dreamer', 'promo', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'master', 'tapes', 'December', '1', '1979', 'performance', 'were', 'discovered', 'drummer', 'Bob', 'Siebenberg', 'barn', 'cow', 'dung', 'Then', 'longtime', 'producer', 'Peter', 'Henderson', 'old', 'concert', 'sound', 'engineer', 'Russell', 'Pope', 'whom', 'produced', 'original', 'album', 'painstakingly', 'restored', 'transferred', 'audio', 'analog', 'digital', 'brilliantly', 'mixed', 'audio', 'Then', 'Peter', 'Clifton', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'finished', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Song', 'Same', 'Joe', 'Massot', 'bailed', 'salvaged', 'footage', 'shot', 'Derek', 'Burbidge', 'who', 'filmed', 'much', 'Police', 'promo', 'videos', 'day', 'added', 'bits', 'round', 'out', 'film', 'What', 'available', 'superb', 'document', 'classic', 'Supertramp', 'lineup.Many', 'great', 'Supertramp', 'classics', 'are', 'included', 'live', 'concert', 'film', 'such', 'most', '1974', 'grand', 'breakthrough', 'Crime', 'Century', 'spirited', 'opener', 'School', 'slightly', 'extended', 'Bloody', 'Well', 'Right', 'excellent', 'Hide', 'Your', 'Shell', 'superb', 'Asylum', 'Top', '20', 'hit', 'Dreamer', 'superb', 'Rudy', 'closing', 'Crime', 'Century', 'live', 'concert', 'film', 'two', 'songs', '1975', 'highly', 'underrated', 'followup', 'Crisis', 'What', 'Crisis', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Two', 'Us', 'superior', 'studio', 'versions', 'three', '1977', 'Gold', 'selling', 'US', 'Even', 'Quietest', 'Moments', 'title', 'cut', 'Give', 'Little', 'Bit', 'best', 'version', 'Fool', 'Overture', 'ever', 'ending', 'be', 'seen', 'believe', 'half', '1', 'Multi-Platinum', 'selling', 'Breakfast', 'America', 'monster', 'hit', 'Logical', 'Song', 'hit', 'Goodbye', 'Stranger', 'title', 'cut', 'Top', '20', 'smash', 'Take', 'Long', 'Way', 'Home', 'epic', 'closer', 'Child', 'Vision', '.Hodgson', 'co-leader/keyboardist/singer/songwriter', 'Rick', 'Davies', 'sing', 'hearts', 'play', 'respective', 'keyboards', 'great', 'passion', 'Hodgson', 'also', 'up', 'incredible', 'fretwork', 'guitar', 'Co-horts', 'John', 'Helliwell', 'saxophones/clarinets/occasional', 'keyboards', 'additional', 'backing', 'vocals', 'drummer', 'Bob', 'C.', 'Benberg', 'bass', 'player', 'Dougie', 'Thomson', 'have', 'terrific', 'interplay', 'Hodgson', 'Davies', 'helping', 'bring', 'band', 'great', 'melodic', 'music', 'life', 'tremendous', 'fashion', 'Just', 'studio', 'albums', 'band', 'totally', 'cook', 'live', 'concert', 'too', 'songs', 'here', 'rival', 'studio', 'counterparts', 'especially', 'Rudy', 'sped', 'faster', 'speed', 'studio', 'version', 'Roger/Rick', 'vocal', 'duel', 'section', 'visuals', 'backdrop', 'films', 'are', 'superb.The', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'shot', 'film', 'were', 'recorded', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Nobody', 'Me', 'Started', 'Laughing', 'Downstream', 'Soapbox', 'Opera', 'From', 'Now', 'are', 'here', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'visuals', 'created', 'specifically', 'DVD/Blu-Ray.Also', 'much', 'Roger', 'Hodgson', 'chagrin', 'songwriting', 'credits', 'are', 'printed', 'back', 'Blu-Ray', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'first', 'issue', 'Supertramp', 'fans', 'are', 'just', 'grateful', 'classic', 'document', 'band', 'peak', 'FINALLY', 'AVAILABLE', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
