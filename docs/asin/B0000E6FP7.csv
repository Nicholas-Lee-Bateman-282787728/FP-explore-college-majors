After an exhaustivefamily search, she turns to a private detective (Robert Prosky) for help. She and her oldest son, Steven (Sam Robards) refuse to give up trying to find Brian, even after the police derail the investigation and even try to stop Prosky from doing his job. Suspenseful and moving, ""Into Thin Air"" paints a realistic portrait of one family's struggle against mostly uncooperative law enforcement to get on and stay on the trail of a missing loved one.",5,Into Thin Air with Ellen Burstyn,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,600,"['Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'shines', 'distraught', 'mother', 'searching', 'middle', 'son', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'enroute', 'Colorado', 'school', 'exhaustivefamily', 'search', 'private', 'detective', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'help', 'oldest', 'son', 'Steven', 'Sam', 'Robards', 'refuse', 'give', 'up', 'trying', 'find', 'Brian', 'even', 'police', 'derail', 'investigation', 'even', 'try', 'stop', 'Prosky', 'doing', 'job', 'Suspenseful', 'moving', 'Into', 'Thin', 'Air', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'one', 'family', 'struggle', 'mostly', 'uncooperative', 'law', 'enforcement', 'get', 'stay', 'trail', 'missing', 'loved', 'one']",N/A

Director Roger Young skillfully crafts a suspensful and heartwrenching story through the use of an excellent script and top-flight performances.Honest, likeable, and repsonsible 19-year-old Brian Walker (Tate Donavan) just &quot;falls off the map&quot; while driving his van to college in Colorado from his home in Ottawa, Ontario.Despite valiant efforts by his mother and brother (Ellen Burstyn and Sam Robards), no one in the law enforcement community has the time or inclination to thoroughly investigate one of the thousand missing kid cases. This leads to Burstyn and Robards teaming up with a private investigator (Robert Prosky) to finally find Brian's van, and ultimately Brian.Burstyn, Prosky, Robards, Patricia Smith (as Prosky's wife), and even Donovan (with limited screen time) are all magnificent. John Dennis Johnston is especially creepy as the man who kidnaps Brian.Although we all know what the ultimate outcome will be, the suspense and heartbreak are still palpable every step of the way - particularly in the last 15 minutes of the film.This is a top notch TV movie.",4,"Excellent Script, Acting and Direction",1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,1214,"['1985', 'made-for-television', 'movie', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'today', 'audiences', 'not', 'average', 'missing', 'person', 'story', 'Director', 'Roger', 'Young', 'skillfully', 'suspensful', 'heartwrenching', 'story', 'use', 'excellent', 'script', 'top-flight', 'performances.Honest', 'likeable', 'repsonsible', '19-year-old', 'Brian', 'Walker', 'Tate', 'Donavan', 'just', 'quot', 'map', 'quot', 'driving', 'van', 'college', 'Colorado', 'home', 'Ottawa', 'Ontario.Despite', 'valiant', 'efforts', 'mother', 'brother', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Sam', 'Robards', 'one', 'law', 'enforcement', 'community', 'time', 'inclination', 'thoroughly', 'investigate', 'one', 'thousand', 'missing', 'kid', 'cases', 'Burstyn', 'Robards', 'teaming', 'up', 'private', 'investigator', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'finally', 'find', 'Brian', 'van', 'ultimately', 'Brian.Burstyn', 'Prosky', 'Robards', 'Patricia', 'Smith', 'Prosky', 'wife', 'even', 'Donovan', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'magnificent', 'John', 'Dennis', 'Johnston', 'especially', 'creepy', 'man', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', 'suspense', 'heartbreak', 'are', 'still', 'palpable', 'step', 'way', 'particularly', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'film.This', 'top', 'notch', 'TV', 'movie']",N/A
