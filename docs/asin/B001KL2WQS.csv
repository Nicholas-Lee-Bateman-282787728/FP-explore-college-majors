1208191,A1QZHYPQBKVU8O,B001KL2WQS,Audrey Phyllis,"[0, 0]",This movie deserves a 5 star as it was well acted by both actresses and the story line is very good and such thing does happen in the real world except not many are fortunate to be housed by the other couple to live close by. I highly recommend to watch it to be watched.,5,Loved it!,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,271,"['movie', '5', 'star', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'actresses', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'good', 'such', 'thing', 'happen', 'real', 'world', 'not', 'many', 'are', 'fortunate', 'be', 'housed', 'other', 'couple', 'live', 'close', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'be', 'watched']",N/A

Wikipedia showed the first ten and then stated that an additional 22 episodes were ordered which would have a total of 32 episodes for the first season. The greedy studio packaged episodes 1-10 as Volume 1, which would mean volume 2 would have episodes 11-32, right? Now when the second half of the season  ended it was on episode 22, so where are episodes 23-32. This was a great show but I cannot find out if it was renewed for a second season, episode 22 was not really a season ending cliffhangar or a series ending final episode.",5,How many episodes?,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,575,"['How', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'there', 'season', '1', 'Wikipedia', 'showed', 'first', 'ten', 'then', 'stated', 'additional', '22', 'episodes', 'were', 'ordered', 'would', 'have', 'total', '32', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'greedy', 'studio', 'packaged', 'episodes', '1-10', 'Volume', '1', 'would', 'mean', 'volume', '2', 'would', 'have', 'episodes', '11-32', 'right', 'Now', 'when', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'ended', 'was', 'episode', '22', 'so', 'where', 'are', 'episodes', '23-32', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', 'episode', '22', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'season', 'ending', 'cliffhangar', 'series', 'ending', 'final', 'episode']",N/A
