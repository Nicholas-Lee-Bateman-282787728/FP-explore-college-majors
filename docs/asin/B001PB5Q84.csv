The interviews with historians, Catholic and non-Catholic scholars, rabbis and Jews give solid credence to show that Pope Pius XII did provide real help to the Jews. He was most certainly NOT a hands-off Pope who ignored what was happening to the Jews.  He saved many, many lives because of his actions!  I highly recommend this documentary to explode the myth that he did nothing or very little.",5,The Truth Revealed,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,536,"['documentary', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'evidence', 'support', 'how', 'Pope', 'Pius', 'XII', 'helped', 'save', 'Jews', 'WWII', 'period', 'interviews', 'historians', 'Catholic', 'non-Catholic', 'scholars', 'rabbis', 'Jews', 'give', 'solid', 'credence', 'show', 'Pope', 'Pius', 'XII', 'did', 'provide', 'real', 'help', 'Jews', 'was', 'most', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'hands-off', 'Pope', 'who', 'ignored', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Jews', 'saved', 'many', 'many', 'lives', 'actions', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'explode', 'myth', 'did', 'nothing', 'very', 'little']",A Hand of Peace: Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust

He was always surrounded by nazis through almost the entire war. And had to be careful. He did much more than USA did. Letting people die by the millions , knowing full well they were.Not to mention other countries.And the USA not letting Jews in the our country , also knowing full well they would be killed when sent back. The shame is no one remembers this. Hate for the Catholic Church keeps this stories going while forgetting the true shame that comes right back home to us. A good read ... I hope his sainthood is coming soon... And it seems his statehood will raise as he seems to be able to be declared Blessed Pius the 12th soon.

1226853,A3UVQ5Z61B0DEB,B001PB5Q84,R. Deethardt,"[2, 2]","I have seen already the documentary 2 times, and will continue watching it as it is wonderful!  I did not know much about this pope so I thank those that took the time to educate us by filminig this documentary.  It is wonderful to see all he did for not only catholics, but Jewish.  Back in the days the church could not talk against the nazis so this pope helped thousands of jewish people to hide in the catholic church, monasteries, etc so they would not get killed.  He also used money from hs heritance to send 3000 jews to Brazil as he got them passports. He started converting the jews to catholics so they could fleat the country and not be prosecuted.  He was great!  He was smart the way he helped all these thousands of jews from not getting killed. I think that a hollywood director should take the time to make it into a movie just like they got to do "" A Man that became Pope"", becasue Pope Pius XII was also great, and many need to hear it.  This documentary is not boring.  Time goes by very quick leaving you with wanting more.  It is not just for catholics, christians or Jewish, but anyone should watch it to learn the history of the nazis not only prosecuting jewish, but catholics too. Here they do not talk so much about how nazis prosecuted the catholics, but they mention it.  I have seen other movies that show killing of priests, nuns when Hitler was in control.  Many think that the nazis killed only jewish, but no they are wrong as they also killed thousands of catholics. The nazis wanted to aniquilate religion so they could keep control of everyone.  Religion was a threat to the Comunist party, because when you believe in GOD we are just focused on our Heavenly Father. Dictators want of us to just focus on them as GOD, and just listen to them, but they see that our lives are focused on GOD and no one will ever be able to destroy that, because GOD won't allow it to happen. Evil devours itself. I have an atheist friend that really liked the documentary.  He was interested in the history that was in it of nazis and the prosecution. He has seen few catholic movies with me and admires the way Catholics help everyone. He really enjoyed it.  That is why I say  it is for everyone.",5,LOVE IT!,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,2218,"['have', 'seen', 'already', 'documentary', '2', 'times', 'will', 'continue', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'pope', 'so', 'thank', 'took', 'time', 'educate', 'filminig', 'documentary', 'wonderful', 'see', 'did', 'not', 'only', 'catholics', 'Jewish', 'Back', 'days', 'church', 'could', 'not', 'talk', 'nazis', 'so', 'pope', 'helped', 'thousands', 'jewish', 'people', 'hide', 'catholic', 'church', 'monasteries', 'etc', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'killed', 'also', 'used', 'money', 'hs', 'heritance', 'send', '3000', 'jews', 'Brazil', 'got', 'passports', 'started', 'converting', 'jews', 'catholics', 'could', 'fleat', 'country', 'not', 'be', 'prosecuted', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'smart', 'way', 'helped', 'all', 'thousands', 'jews', 'not', 'getting', 'killed', 'think', 'hollywood', 'director', 'should', 'take', 'time', 'make', 'movie', 'just', 'got', 'do', 'A', 'Man', 'became', 'Pope', 'becasue', 'Pope', 'Pius', 'XII', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'many', 'need', 'hear', 'documentary', 'not', 'boring', 'Time', 'very', 'quick', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'not', 'just', 'catholics', 'christians', 'Jewish', 'anyone', 'should', 'watch', 'learn', 'history', 'nazis', 'not', 'only', 'prosecuting', 'jewish', 'catholics', 'too', 'Here', 'do', 'not', 'talk', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'nazis', 'prosecuted', 'catholics', 'mention', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'show', 'killing', 'priests', 'nuns', 'when', 'Hitler', 'was', 'control', 'Many', 'think', 'nazis', 'killed', 'only', 'jewish', 'are', 'wrong', 'also', 'killed', 'thousands', 'catholics', 'nazis', 'wanted', 'aniquilate', 'religion', 'could', 'keep', 'control', 'everyone', 'Religion', 'was', 'threat', 'Comunist', 'party', 'when', 'believe', 'GOD', 'are', 'just', 'focused', 'Heavenly', 'Father', 'Dictators', 'want', 'just', 'focus', 'GOD', 'just', 'listen', 'see', 'lives', 'are', 'focused', 'GOD', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'destroy', 'GOD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'happen', 'Evil', 'have', 'atheist', 'friend', 'really', 'liked', 'documentary', 'was', 'interested', 'history', 'was', 'nazis', 'prosecution', 'seen', 'few', 'catholic', 'movies', 'way', 'Catholics', 'help', 'everyone', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'why', 'say', 'everyone']",A Hand of Peace: Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust

It gives much information on why he was blamed for doing nothing for the Jews, but in reality he saved many of them.  It does not include information that he saved Jews after the Catholic Church allowed Hitler to rise to power in the first place.  Just like Obama, Hitler could have been stopped via excommunication of the Catholics who voted for him. Anyone who stands for murder should not be able to consume the Eucharist.
