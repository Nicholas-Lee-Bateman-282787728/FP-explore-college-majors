932865,A3MU9G6YWKTGTA,B000ASDFHM,Cary L. Brown,"[1, 2]","I find reading the reviews for Christian materials (notably on Amazon, but elsewhere as well) to be exercises in frustration at times.  There are those who post ""reviews"" who never saw the flick or read the book or whatever, and are purely posting what is, by definition, ""hate speech"" directed against Christians.  Then there are the folks who actually did watch/read/etc the item and who didn't care for it on some legitimate basis (few and far between, but the only critical ones really worth reading, in my judgment).  Then there are the ""fanboy"" reviews which go unreasonably over-the-top in praising something which may be good but may still have some flaws...  but you'd never guess it from those reviews.  And then there are the ""flowers and rosiness"" reviews from people who hate to have to THINK about matters of faith, and only want ""happy-happy-fun-time"" religion, and who are often negative towards materials which involve actual intellectual challenging of their staid, settled, comfortable ""belief traditions.""In my case, I'm a believing, practicing Christian who recognizes that all materials, including Christian materials, are subject to flaws and defects and HONEST, FAIR critiques are entirely appropriate, but childish taunting or mindless ""fluffy thinking"" are not.  I find all of the above equally annoying, as a result.About this movie...  it's a pretty decently done flick.  The special effects aren't anywhere near the level of a Hollywood blockbuster, but it's clear that this is where they were trying to go with this film.The film takes a small section of time, spanning the end of the one book and the first section of the next book, and ""fills in the blanks"" in ways which are entirely consistent with the books..  with one minor exception and one major one, both revolving around the deaths of characters.  One minor character died (of suicide) in the first book but didn't die in the movies, so that character dies early in this movie.  The second character I'm discussing (attempting to be spoiler-free) dies of a disease in both cases, but in one case this character dies in a hospital, and no one knows exactly how he died, though poisoning is suspected, while in the flick this character dies of a similar situation which becomes much more widespread and is a major plot point in the film.Excepting those two deviations, the rest of the film is entirely consistent with the books, and ""could have happened"" in the book universe as well as in the movie universe.Of course, the movies and the books are not consistent in many other areas...  which is just fine.  This movie is actually a bit more ""conformant"" to the books than the prior too, as far as I'm concerned...  as, at the end of this film, both universes have essentially converged into one common scenario.This movie stands quite well on its own.  It's a bit more ""action/adventure"" than the prior two, but this is entirely consistent with the novels, which do have quite a bit of that sort of thing in them.  It would be hard NOT to put that sort of thing into stories intended to be consistent with Christian eschatology (""end times beliefs"").  While I personally believe that the authors of the book series got a number of things significantly wrong, they never claimed to be writing historical documents...  they were writing NOVELS, after all.  I doubt very much that there will be some blonde, blue-eyed European ""Nicolae"" nor will the Antichristian world region be what they promoted in such an almost ""funny"" way.  I think that the real Antichrist, and the real Antichristian faith, will be something many of us are already familiar with (hint - watch for the restoration of the Caliphate once Assad's Syria falls).SO...  for anyone who thinks that they're watching ""what's really going to happen,"" as if this were prophecy...  put that out of your mind right now.  This is FICTION, but fiction with a message, and fiction that is intended to provide some basic instruction to believers (and potential believers) about how to deal with whatever really DOES happen, even if it's not quite what's seen in the books or in the films.Resistance, both on an internal (including but not limited to spiritual) basis, and on a physical basis (which may, if things get bad enough, require the sort of paramilitary activities seen in this film...  and if you believe in Christian eschatology, you have to know that at some point things will get that bad, and will continue to get steadily worse) is entirely acceptable.  Giving in to evil, ""going along to get along"" and the like...  that's what this movie is intended to strengthen your resolve against.  The character of President Fitzhue (Louis Gossett Jr, in an EXCELLENT performance, frankly) is the one who starts off ""going along to get along"" and who learned, apparently too late, what this really means...  but who learns the truth, and takes a strong stand, at the end.Yes, the ending of the film doesn't result in the ""good guys beating the bad guys"" entirely...  it's a minor victory in a war which is destined, at least for the moment, for the ""bad guys"" to win...  but we know that the ""bad guy's victory"" is going to be very short-lived.Many of us believe that this is all coming to a real head shortly...  that a global government is being established now, that freedom (including freedom to practice our faith as we choose to, or choose not to, without governmental interference, but also including many, many other elements not directly related to faith or to religion - which are, by the way, not the same thing!) is being taken away, and that for the first time in human history, every element of prophecy is coming together.  There's no longer any need to ""stretch"" or to ""read in""...  you can take things very literally and see all the signs right now.These movies, and the books upon which they are loosely based, are to be taken, at most, as allegorical...  as ""fables"" intended to teach certain lessons.  The lessons are directly applicable to what many of us will likely have to live through for real in the not too distant future.  But it would be a mistake to treat them, and this movie in particular (since we're reviewing this movie in particular) as anything beyond that.It's a thriller/drama with allegorical, rather than prophetic, overtones.  Watched on that level, it's a good, decent quality movie, rating a good solid ""4 out of five"" stars.",4,"An entertaining movie, parallel to but not entirely consistent with the book

932871,AS56N6FYEQ12U,B000ASDFHM,coinman,"[3, 4]","I have read all twelve books in the ""Left Behind"" series and this movie has very little in common with those books. As others have mentioned, the movie uses the same names and many of the same characters as the other two movies, but it is far from the story line. For example, the books NEVER that I remember had even a small section written from the perspective of the president, yet in this movie, the president is the main character. Also, what is with the vice-president being killed next to the car while the president was on the other side of the car and still survives? Or, on a wider basis, what is with the attack on the president, and especially the phantom motorcylists? That whole section is completely ridiculous.In my opinion, the worst part of the movie is the parts with the virus. The book had nothing about the GC producing biological weapons and especially nothing about Carpathia contaminating Bibles with a virus. Anyway, before the cause of the virus is determined, Bruce (who happens to be played by a different character which makes it a little confusing) and Chloe catch the virus. Before Bruce dies, he askes to be served Communion. Before he can drink the wine, he dies. The rest continue on after a few moments, starting with Chloe. When Chloe drinks the wine, she is miraculously healed. Being a Christian movie, you would think that this would mean that God miraculously healed her, but soon after, Chloe calls Buck and tells him that the cure for the virus is red wine! That is ridiculous!Another fault I have with this movie is the fact that the first time you are introduced to Amanda White is during the double wedding between her and Ray and Buck and Chloe. In the book, there was a short ""introductory"" period with some explanation of how she met Ray.Overall, I do not recommend this movie. Even if you want to see all of the movies in the series once they come out, be warnd that this movie doesn't even pick up where ""Tribulation Force"" left off, and is rather confusing for a while.In my opinion, you need to read the books to make any sense out of the movie, yet when you read the books, you find very little similarity between the books and this movie.

932877,A2XBBQ36STNJ0G,B000ASDFHM,here_is_your_review,"[8, 13]","The film opens with the President of the United States (Louis Gossett, Jr.) struggling with the events of the previous 7 days; 7 days that changed his life forever.  As the world embraces ecumenical religion and ecumenical government, the President fights to keep America a separate nation (indeed the heart of the Declaration of Independence).  Charles Martin Smith (""Roswell"", ""Starman"", ""American Graffiti"") makes a cameo appearance as the Vice President.  Many others have reprised their roles, except Clarence Gilyard (""Top Gun"") has not returned as Bruce Barnes, here played by another actor who also does a decent job.  Once again they tried to present the Gospel in the film in a clear way.I recommend viewers new to the series be certain to watch ""Left Behind"" and ""Left Behind 2: Tribulation Force"" first to give the proper background to the characters and events portrayed in this film.  And it should be stated, the most significant Sign of the Times is not weather, but the reborn Nation of Israel.  Israel is the key focus in all End Times events of Daniel 8, 9, 11 and 12, Ezekiel 34, 36, 37, 38 and 39, Zechariah 12, 13 and 14, Revelation 11, 13 and 19, Isaiah 66, Matthew 24, Luke 21, Mark 13, 1st and 2nd Thessalonians 2 and many other Bible prophecies.  Jerusalem will be the Burdensome Stone, indeed the problem no nation can solve in the Last Days (Zechariah 12:1-3).And the cinematography is excellent on the film, giving it a crisp feeling.  Kirk Cameron has taken on a new look which adds to his character's credibility.  The DVD offers the usual repertoire including subtitles of English, French and Spanish.  Although I generally agree with the End Times outline as presented in the books, I believe the End Times religious Babylon is not in Iraq, as presented in the film (see 1 Peter 5:13).  This is why the city is called ""Mystery"" Babylon in Revelation 17:18.  Tim LaHaye was involved in an excellent documentary called ""End Times in the Words of Jesus"" which is available on Amazon.Com in both DVD and VHS formats and is an absolute ""must have"" for anyone who has viewed the ""Left Behind"" movies.  Don't wait to add this movie to your collection as it very clearly lays out End Times events.  Also recommended are ""Israel, Islam and Armageddon"" released the month before September 11, 2001 and ""25 Messianic Signs in Israel Today"".  Both of these are available at Amazon.Com though the former not in the DVD version which TheBereanCall.Org offers (this writer has no affiliation with either).  These products will help put events into the proper perspective.Anyone who doubts the ability to have a world-wide economic system need only look at biometric implants and scanners, grocery stores that have pay-by-scan of fingerprints, speedy pay systems by encoded devices and cards, RFID tags that tell distributors when shipments are misdirected or lost, vending machines and parking meters that accept credit and debit cards, etc. to comprehend that a system, as described in Revelation 13, is easily and technologically within reach in our lifetime.  Towards this end, the ""Left Behind"" films and books, while not perfect, are aimed at raising awareness to these things.  Read the statement of the week of October 26, 2005, by the Iranian president declaring ""Israel should be wiped off the face of the Earth"" and then read Ezekiel 38:5; an event that occurs after Israel is reborn as a nation (Ezekiel 34:13, 36:24, 37).  And Russia is actively providing nuclear technology to Iran.  This is not some fiction-based writing, these are real headlines in your daily newspaper and on TV.  And the land of Israel is divided in the Last Days (Daniel 11:38-39), by someone honoring a ""strange god"" and this dividing of Israel brings about Armageddon (Joel 3:2).  Seem preposterous?  At one time maybe.  Read the above references and watch the news, even if you don't buy this movie.",5,"Another Excellent Step in the ""Left Behind"" Film Series!!!",1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,3906,"['film', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'struggling', 'events', 'previous', '7', 'days', '7', 'days', 'changed', 'life', 'forever', 'world', 'ecumenical', 'religion', 'ecumenical', 'government', 'President', 'fights', 'keep', 'America', 'separate', 'nation', 'indeed', 'heart', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'Charles', 'Martin', 'Smith', 'Roswell', 'Starman', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Vice', 'President', 'Many', 'others', 'have', 'reprised', 'roles', 'Clarence', 'Gilyard', 'Top', 'Gun', 'not', 'returned', 'Bruce', 'Barnes', 'here', 'played', 'actor', 'who', 'also', 'decent', 'job', 'Once', 'again', 'tried', 'present', 'Gospel', 'film', 'clear', 'way.I', 'recommend', 'viewers', 'new', 'series', 'be', 'certain', 'watch', 'Left', 'Behind', 'Left', 'Behind', '2', 'Tribulation', 'Force', 'first', 'give', 'proper', 'background', 'characters', 'events', 'portrayed', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'stated', 'most', 'significant', 'Sign', 'Times', 'not', 'weather', 'reborn', 'Nation', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'key', 'focus', 'End', 'Times', 'events', 'Daniel', '8', '9', '11', '12', 'Ezekiel', '34', '36', '37', '38', '39', 'Zechariah', '12', '13', '14', 'Revelation', '11', '13', '19', 'Isaiah', '66', 'Matthew', '24', 'Luke', '21', 'Mark', '13', '1st', '2nd', 'Thessalonians', '2', 'many', 'other', 'Bible', 'prophecies', 'Jerusalem', 'will', 'be', 'Burdensome', 'Stone', 'indeed', 'problem', 'nation', 'can', 'solve', 'Last', 'Days', 'Zechariah', '12:1-3', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'film', 'giving', 'crisp', 'feeling', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'taken', 'new', 'look', 'character', 'credibility', 'DVD', 'usual', 'repertoire', 'including', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'generally', 'agree', 'End', 'Times', 'outline', 'presented', 'books', 'believe', 'End', 'Times', 'religious', 'Babylon', 'not', 'Iraq', 'presented', 'film', 'see', '1', 'Peter', '5:13', 'why', 'city', 'called', 'Mystery', 'Babylon', 'Revelation', '17:18', 'Tim', 'LaHaye', 'was', 'involved', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'called', 'End', 'Times', 'Words', 'Jesus', 'available', 'Amazon.Com', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'formats', 'absolute', 'must', 'have', 'anyone', 'who', 'viewed', 'Left', 'Behind', 'movies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'add', 'movie', 'collection', 'very', 'clearly', 'out', 'End', 'Times', 'events', 'Also', 'recommended', 'are', 'Israel', 'Islam', 'Armageddon', 'released', 'month', 'September', '11', '2001', '25', 'Messianic', 'Signs', 'Israel', 'Today', 'are', 'available', 'Amazon.Com', 'former', 'not', 'DVD', 'version', 'TheBereanCall.Org', 'writer', 'affiliation', 'products', 'will', 'help', 'put', 'events', 'proper', 'perspective.Anyone', 'who', 'ability', 'have', 'world-wide', 'economic', 'system', 'need', 'only', 'look', 'biometric', 'implants', 'scanners', 'grocery', 'stores', 'have', 'pay-by-scan', 'fingerprints', 'speedy', 'pay', 'systems', 'encoded', 'devices', 'cards', 'RFID', 'tell', 'distributors', 'when', 'shipments', 'are', 'misdirected', 'lost', 'vending', 'machines', 'parking', 'meters', 'accept', 'credit', 'debit', 'cards', 'etc', 'comprehend', 'system', 'described', 'Revelation', '13', 'easily', 'technologically', 'reach', 'lifetime', 'end', 'Left', 'Behind', 'films', 'books', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'aimed', 'raising', 'awareness', 'things', 'Read', 'statement', 'week', 'October', '26', '2005', 'Iranian', 'president', 'declaring', 'Israel', 'should', 'be', 'wiped', 'face', 'Earth', 'then', 'read', 'Ezekiel', '38:5', 'event', 'Israel', 'reborn', 'nation', 'Ezekiel', '34:13', '36:24', '37', 'Russia', 'actively', 'providing', 'nuclear', 'technology', 'Iran', 'not', 'fiction-based', 'writing', 'are', 'real', 'headlines', 'daily', 'newspaper', 'TV', 'land', 'Israel', 'divided', 'Last', 'Days', 'Daniel', '11:38-39', 'someone', 'honoring', 'strange', 'god', 'dividing', 'Israel', 'Armageddon', 'Joel', '3:2', 'Seem', 'preposterous', 'one', 'time', 'maybe', 'Read', 'above', 'references', 'watch', 'news', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie']",Left Behind - World at War

Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron), Chloe Steele (Janaya Stephens), and Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) must figure out who or what is causing the plague and stop it before its too late.Louis Gossett Jr. stars as President Gerald Fitzhugh, who has been in a close working relationship with Global Community leader Nicolae Carpathia, played excellently one again by Gordon Currie.  An undergound faction lend by the president himself, with assistance from Carolyn Miller (Jessica Stern) has been watching Carpathia's activities.  They soon learn that the virus is being transmitted by infected Bibles.  Many infected people have been flocking to churches seeking assistance from the plague.  Fitzhugh has also found out that Carpathia plans to attack the countries of the world with the weapons that they surrendered to him as a gesture of peace.Amidst all of these activities, Rayford has married Amanda White (Laura Catalano), and Buck has finally married Chloe.  Unfortunately, one of the infected is Bruce Barnes, the pastor of the Steele's local church.Racing against time, President Fitzhugh confronts Nicolae about his plans.  Using some unseen force, Nicolae lifts the president up and throws him out of a window several stories high.  Miraculously, he survives.  Soon, he is visited by Buck, who witnesses to him and prays with him.  With his new-found salvation and with the help of a small transmitter, Fitzhugh returns to Nicolae's office.  What will happen between Nicolae and President Fitzhugh?  Will the world survive?I found this movie to be slightly different than the first two.  While the earlier movies followed the books very closely, this film deviated somewhat from the storyline.  I can't remember some of the instances, but some, such as Chloe being healed by the wine after accepting communion and Hattie Durham's (Chelsea Noble) attempted pass at Rayford did mesh with the books.Overall, I did enjoy this film very much.  Although there is some deviation, the story is still good and the acting, led once again by Gordon Currie, is outstanding.  I highly recommend this movie.

Fields,"[12, 21]","For those of you that have been living under a rock the last few years, this movie is based upon the Left Behind novels and is the third installment.  Please read the entire series because no film can relay everything that the books have to offer.  Basically, the novels and the movies that they're based on tell a modern tale of the end times which can be found in the New Testament of the bible.  It's a fascinating way to retell the King James version of these events.  It puts things into perspective for us folks who live in the modern age.  Case in point;  The Rapture:  (for you folks that don't know the bible, it describes Christ's return to earth to collect the church) In the bible all of the Christians are removed from the earth and taken to heaven in an instant.  The bible says it happens in the twinkle of an eye.  Reading that in the bible doesn't necessarily bring to mind what would take place when that event occurs.  But in the original novel it is plain to see.  Drivers vanish while cars are in motion, airplane pilots disappear in mid flight, all over the world people vanish right before everyone else's eyes.  Planes fall from the sky, cars crash and everywhere you look you see piles of clothes where people once stood.Get the point?  The movie brings these things to life so to speak thereby making the bible story much more understandable for many folks.  As a Christian this is a must see.  If you're not a Christian it's still a must see.  I just wish that there were a bigger budget for these films for higher visability.  I challenge George Lucas or Steven Spielberg to remake them.  Either of these guys could do wonders with them.  They probably wouldn't want to tackle the subject matter though given their own religious views.Once you pick up the first book of the Left Behind series it's very difficult to put down.  Others have tried to novelize the endtime events but to date none have ever been as successful.  The series begins with the second coming of Christ to the appearance of the anti-christ, to his gaining power, to world domination, all the way to his ultimate defeat.  This series is a little difficult to describe because even though some might think so, it isn't fiction in the truest sense of the word.  It isn't fantasy (although some unbelievers think the bible is such).  It's futuristic only in the sense that it hasn't happened yet.Even though this film is not a big budget item it is still well acted because the actors are dedicated to telling the story that others may never know about because they are not church goers or bible readers.  I urge you strongly to watch these films and explain them to your kids.

Because to inquire about the truth leads one to the pillar, and that bulwark is the Church, the visible Church. Thankfully for 2000 years we have stood on that rock of authority versus our own fallible interpretations of an end which has led us to skip our beginnings and stunted our growth.One does wonder however, how some can deny transubstantiation and then validate what occurs in this movie. Namely, that the Sacred Host was used to cure and all the while remained a 'symbol' of Christ's Body and Blood. Somehow, it must have been faith, and yet if faith was the only thing required, and the vessel of our Lord did not truly transform from a wafer, than the mere symbolic gesture is empty.Hopefully this film will be another reason for Protestants to come home to 2000 years of authority and abandon nonsensical, subjective and recent 'theologies' about the end times.",1,Another slice of fantasy,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,1243,"['Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'enthusiasm', 'books', 'movies', 'many', 'wish', 'related', 'more', 'other.However', 'do', 'agree', 'one', 'reviewer', 'subtle', 'Christian', 'film', 'universal', 'message', 'more', 'appealing', 'subjective', 'interpretations', 'explicit', 'thought', 'conveyed', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'involved', 'group', 'think', 'rather', 'truth', 'inquire', 'truth', 'one', 'pillar', 'bulwark', 'Church', 'visible', 'Church', 'Thankfully', '2000', 'years', 'have', 'stood', 'rock', 'authority', 'own', 'fallible', 'interpretations', 'end', 'led', 'skip', 'beginnings', 'stunted', 'growth.One', 'wonder', 'however', 'how', 'can', 'deny', 'transubstantiation', 'then', 'validate', 'what', 'movie', 'Namely', 'Sacred', 'Host', 'was', 'used', 'cure', 'while', 'remained', ""'symbol"", 'Christ', 'Body', 'Blood', 'Somehow', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'faith', 'yet', 'faith', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'required', 'vessel', 'Lord', 'did', 'not', 'truly', 'transform', 'wafer', 'mere', 'symbolic', 'gesture', 'empty.Hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'reason', 'Protestants', 'come', 'home', '2000', 'years', 'authority', 'abandon', 'nonsensical', 'subjective', 'recent', ""'theologies"", 'end', 'times']",Left Behind - World at War

SPOILERS for those who have not read the book or seen the movie yet.Bruce and many other Christians, including Chloe, get a deadly disease from planted Bibles that Nicolae has had sprayed with a poisonus mist. That is not in the book at all, i remember that much. Chloe almost dies and would have if she hadn't taken comunion. In the book, Bruce picks up the disease in some foreign country and Chloe's car flips, I don't see what would've been so hard about conveying that on screen. To screw up the story even more, President Fitsguh shoots Nicolae at point blank range and in return Nicolae picks him up with a force like power and throws Fitsguh out the window, 30 stories down. The president miracously survives and ends up returning later on, launching a missle directly into his office, destroying the whole GC office. I'm sorry but nothing like that happens in the book. What is this based on really? Nothing. I can understand why they did what they did, to make it more dramatic and emotional (ie. to have Chloe, Ray, and Amanda be with Bruce while he dies in the church) but it's not anything like the original story which would could have easily been conveyed on screen. The movies are not as dark as I remember the books being, the whole movie series thus far has had the agenda of getting the gospel message in there, and there's nothing wrong with that, but the movies seem less realistic and bogged down by it. the books presented the gospel well and with a good realistic story.

We know the story, the characters, and yes, even the actors/actresses.  We care about them, and enjoy seeing what we've read and imagined 'come to life.'  As such, LB3 is enjoyable--though like many others, I'd say #2 was the best, thus far.Viewers who have not read the books, or who have not seen the previous movies will be at a loss.  LB3 will seem disjointed and incomplete.  The acting will seem uneven, and at times down-right odd.  The most glaring example is when seductress Hattie suddenly becomes timid and resigned in the face of Captain Ray's wife telling her she understands, forgives and loves her.  Such a response was possible, but not plausible--and not on track with what had happened previously.
