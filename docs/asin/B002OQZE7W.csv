I started to take notice of his brand of humor as I'm sure most of the country did on The Chapelle Show. I never thought twice about possibly becoming a full fledged comic. Charlie has the talent of making the show feel like a personal conversation. I literally felt like a friend or close associate was telling me story after story lol. His story is amazing and inspirational at the same time. I enjoyed the DVD thoroughly and would recommend it to any pure stand up fan.,5,Charlie Murphy Has Arrived,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,550,"['honestly', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'started', 'take', 'notice', 'brand', 'humor', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'country', 'did', 'Chapelle', 'Show', 'never', 'thought', 'twice', 'possibly', 'becoming', 'full', 'fledged', 'comic', 'Charlie', 'talent', 'making', 'show', 'feel', 'personal', 'conversation', 'literally', 'felt', 'friend', 'close', 'associate', 'was', 'telling', 'story', 'story', 'lol', 'story', 'amazing', 'inspirational', 'same', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'thoroughly', 'would', 'recommend', 'pure', 'stand', 'up', 'fan']",N/A

It's never easy to watch a stand up comedian bomb especially for an hour. I don't know why Comedy Central even bothered to air the performance. He overshot his abilities as a story teller without the support of Dave Chapelle's genius. I think it would have been better for Charlie if this special was just swept under the rug.,1,Uncomfortable to watch,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,439,"['Did', 'not', 'buy', 'saw', 'portion', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Watched', 'ten', 'minutes', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'never', 'easy', 'watch', 'stand', 'up', 'comedian', 'bomb', 'especially', 'hour', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'even', 'bothered', 'air', 'performance', 'overshot', 'abilities', 'story', 'teller', 'support', 'Dave', 'Chapelle', 'genius', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Charlie', 'special', 'was', 'just', 'swept', 'rug']",N/A

He's doing a stand-up show in Boston and it is not as funny as you would hope coming from Charlie Murphy. I did not laugh nor find humor in his video at all. On Dave Chapelle he was pretty funny, I am sure that is because he was backed by several comedians on the show, but he is doing a stand-up routine all by himself and he should really have some help because he bombed this one. I did not purchase this video from Amazon, so I cannot speak on delivery but I will say, save your money because this is a piece of garbage. I hope this helps...YMMV.

1281871,A218J58CFFQOPW,B002OQZE7W,D. Myatt,"[3, 3]","Ironically, an apology is exactly what Charlie Murphy owes anyone who watches this excruciatingly unfunny stand-up project. Murphy's material is stale and poorly-written; his timing and delivery is, to put it kindly, amateurish and off; and most disturbingly of all, Murphy fails -- big time -- to live up to the comic legacy and laugh-inducing expectations derived from his better-known little brother -- as well as his own well-deserved reputation as a hilarious cast member on the stellar ""Chappelle's Show."" I was saddened for the show's live audience members: they came out to the show earnestly expecting laughs from the man on stage, and he delivered none. Bottom line is: Murphy should stick to sketch projects and perhaps movies and such. But, it's made blatantly clear with this troubling example: Charlie Murphy can't do stand-up! I challenge you to make it to the end of this project -- and if you do, inevitably, you'll feel disappointed and angry, frustrated for wasting 63 precious minutes of your life, and undoubtedly desirous of that aforementioned apology Murphy refuses to provide!",1,"Well then, Perhaps Eddie or Dave Chappelle Will Apologize on Your Behalf -- Because an Apology is Definitely Due!",1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,1101,"['Ironically', 'apology', 'exactly', 'what', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'anyone', 'who', 'excruciatingly', 'unfunny', 'stand-up', 'project', 'Murphy', 'material', 'stale', 'poorly-written', 'timing', 'delivery', 'put', 'kindly', 'amateurish', 'most', 'disturbingly', 'Murphy', 'big', 'time', 'live', 'up', 'comic', 'legacy', 'laugh-inducing', 'expectations', 'derived', 'better-known', 'little', 'brother', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'well-deserved', 'reputation', 'hilarious', 'cast', 'member', 'stellar', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'was', 'saddened', 'show', 'live', 'audience', 'members', 'came', 'out', 'show', 'earnestly', 'expecting', 'laughs', 'man', 'stage', 'delivered', 'none', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Murphy', 'should', 'stick', 'sketch', 'projects', 'perhaps', 'movies', 'such', 'made', 'blatantly', 'clear', 'troubling', 'example', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'stand-up', 'challenge', 'make', 'end', 'project', 'do', 'inevitably', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'disappointed', 'angry', 'frustrated', 'wasting', '63', 'precious', 'minutes', 'life', 'undoubtedly', 'desirous', 'aforementioned', 'apology', 'Murphy', 'provide']",N/A
