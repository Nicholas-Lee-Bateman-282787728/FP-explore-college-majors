690771,A3BSNRKBUKXK6T,B00005YUOC,Richard Glenister,"[0, 0]","For a short time George Jones carried the title of Thumper Jones but there is little evidence of the source of this name until the final song on the DVD, 'I Don't Need your Rocking Chair'. (released 1992, long after he won the title of Thumper.)Sure, the other 13 songs are in genuine Country and Western mode, with a few to bring tears to your eyes, but not so with 'I Don't Need Your Rocking Chair.'C and W performers are not expected to show happiness and joy as they render their numbers but George and his supporting cast put the sad image behind them as they whoop up this upbeat rendering.  You will want to play this track over and over once you become infected.Remember when you watch it that the man was then 61 years of age and overcame several bouts of rehab to deal with alcohol and drugs, and one would have to believe from his history, some Anger Management treatment as well.Each number in the DVD has George with an introductory story to tell - mercifully the stories are brief.Of genuine interest is the change in presentation, as the clips take us through from 1959 to 1992.  The artist is barely recognizable in the early tracks when he appears in Mexican style gear and with a stilted cast of performers.  And please note the hair style in the early clips!These early numbers were #1 hits, and while that is hard to  believe, we need to have a sense of history in an effort to decode what we are seeing.'Golden Ring' is a sensitive offering - a duet featuring George with Tammy Wynette.  It was released in June 1976 but there is every chance it was recorded in 1975, or prior, the year Tammy and George were divorced after just a few years of marriage.Much the same might be said about their other duet on the disk 'Near You"".  This was not released until December 1976 over a year after their divorce.  Whatever the recording date, the two artists deliver a tender rendition, including the kiss.  Both duets made #1 on the charts.The good news is that the DVD is in color.  Dolby Sound understandably is rated at only 2.0 but quality screen delivery and a better than average sound system will deliver the goods for what is an enjoyable trip through 33 years of Country and Western Time.Richard Glenister",4,50 Minutes of Country and Western Memories over 33 Years,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,2227,"['short', 'time', 'George', 'Jones', 'carried', 'title', 'Thumper', 'Jones', 'little', 'evidence', 'source', 'name', 'final', 'song', 'DVD', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Rocking', 'Chair', 'released', '1992', 'long', 'won', 'title', 'Thumper', 'Sure', 'other', '13', 'songs', 'are', 'genuine', 'Country', 'Western', 'mode', 'few', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'not', 'so', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Your', 'Rocking', 'Chair', 'C', 'W', 'performers', 'are', 'not', 'expected', 'show', 'happiness', 'joy', 'render', 'numbers', 'George', 'supporting', 'cast', 'put', 'sad', 'image', 'behind', 'whoop', 'up', 'upbeat', 'rendering', 'will', 'want', 'play', 'track', 'once', 'become', 'infected.Remember', 'when', 'watch', 'man', 'was', 'then', '61', 'years', 'age', 'overcame', 'several', 'bouts', 'rehab', 'deal', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'history', 'Anger', 'Management', 'treatment', 'well.Each', 'number', 'DVD', 'George', 'introductory', 'story', 'tell', 'mercifully', 'stories', 'are', 'brief.Of', 'genuine', 'interest', 'change', 'presentation', 'clips', 'take', '1959', '1992', 'artist', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'early', 'tracks', 'when', 'Mexican', 'style', 'gear', 'stilted', 'cast', 'performers', 'please', 'note', 'hair', 'style', 'early', 'clips', 'early', 'numbers', 'were', '1', 'hits', 'hard', 'believe', 'need', 'have', 'sense', 'history', 'effort', 'decode', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', ""'Golden"", 'Ring', 'sensitive', 'offering', 'duet', 'featuring', 'George', 'Tammy', 'Wynette', 'was', 'released', 'June', '1976', 'chance', 'was', 'recorded', '1975', 'prior', 'year', 'Tammy', 'George', 'were', 'divorced', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'same', 'might', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'duet', 'disk', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'December', '1976', 'year', 'divorce', 'recording', 'date', 'two', 'artists', 'deliver', 'tender', 'rendition', 'including', 'kiss', 'duets', 'made', '1', 'charts.The', 'good', 'news', 'DVD', 'color', 'Dolby', 'Sound', 'understandably', 'rated', 'only', '2.0', 'quality', 'screen', 'delivery', 'better', 'average', 'sound', 'system', 'will', 'deliver', 'goods', 'what', 'enjoyable', 'trip', '33', 'years', 'Country', 'Western', 'Time.Richard', 'Glenister']",N/A
