I wish some one would bring out a good Swiss Ball Workout that was both fun and effective.  This is now going to gather dust on my shelf along with his other two dvd's.,1,Give it a Miss,1308355200,"06 18, 2011",2011,286,"['bought', 'three', 'workouts', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'hasty', 'found', 'very', 'boring', 'tedious', 'difficult', 'wish', 'one', 'would', 'bring', 'out', 'good', 'Swiss', 'Ball', 'Workout', 'was', 'fun', 'effective', 'now', 'going', 'gather', 'dust', 'shelf', 'other', 'two', 'dvd']",N/A

Unless you are superman and have immense strength, this video is not for you! I am an avid excersiser and think i'm fairly strong, but this video was impossible for me to do! I was in pain trying to do these impossible moves! I tried this video several times thinking i would get the hang of it, but to no avail.

There are 3 ten minute swiss ball workouts which work the entire midesection with non-traditional and challenging moves. This is not your typical ball workout, nor is it for those who can't balance on a ball. If you are looking to slim your core and have decent abdominal strength this will balance your trunk.

1000762,ADORN2AT1QEJH,B000GALI6O,researching,"[0, 0]","I really appreciate this DVD! The way it is delivery is very professional. No bal, bla, bla. Adam Ford goes direct to the point of the workout and manage to deliver as a master. Very useful if you intend to give classes on the Swiss ball. But, be careful, if you are new on the ball, this workout can be very intense and dangerous. Dangerous if you do not know to use the ball at all.For me this DVD is for great value in all senses. Helped me in my classes as well  as on my own workout!

This is an excellent training DVD if you want to maximize your fitness conditioning and increase your functional strength, suppleness, agility and coordination. The 3 training segments are each 20 minutes, not 10 minutes as another reviewer reported. The videography is excellent, clearly and simply showing each movement without any fancy fadeouts or quick switches. Each phase is more challenging. I would say that the phase 1 section can be done by most people of average fitness after a couple of weeks of practice. However at first you may need your remote to pause the DVD until you acquire the skill to transition into and out of some of the more challening postions. Let's face it, if you aren't at an average fitness level then you should be doing a different overal kind of training, not focusing on abs. Personally I am 56 years old and teach Holistic Nature Workouts professionally. I have shared the training methods in this DVD with several people already and they have all benefited tremendously from them and are now including them in their workouts.

So take mine with a grain of salt because I am not the most flexible person and this video calls for someone who is.I guess that's why the workout hit me in areas that were not target areas. I didn't enjoy the workout as I have others.The video itself is technically great. You can easily go to the phase or workout you want. There are three. In addition, there is an introduction that tells you about the fitness ball, sizing, etc. Very good.There is also a bonus section with added information. I wish all exercise videos were technically as well produced as this one.The workouts get right to it. No unnecessary talk. It's a bare bones workout.But  I was not at all impressed. I think a very flexible person and perhaps a taller person could do these nicely.
