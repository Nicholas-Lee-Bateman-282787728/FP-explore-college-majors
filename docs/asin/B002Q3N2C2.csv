1283388,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B002Q3N2C2,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[9, 10]","The goal of this exercise DVD by instructor Chris Freytag is to provide various workout options to get you moving every day for two weeks--hence the ""2 Week Turnaround"" in the title.  Freytag offers two cardio walking workouts, each about 15 minutes long, which can be used together or separately, and a Yoga Strength segment which can serve as either a cool-down or a stand-alone practice.  Freytag is jointed by two background exercisers, Christine and Jessica, who show easier and harder modifications, respectively.  They are working out in a bright indoor studio with the Prevention logo appearing on the side walls.  Names of the exercises appear on the bottom of the screen as they occur.The first cardio workout is the Power Walk, and it clocks in at just under 15 minutes.  It starts with about a 2-minute warm-up with simple moves like shoulder rolls, low kicks, knee ups, and step taps.  Then, Freytag and Jessica pick up weights, training the upper body and lower body together to increase the cardio effect.  The moves are easy-to-follow--e.g., walk forward with bicep curls, knee ups with shoulder press, side steps with shoulder lifts, and side squats--and Freytag strings them together in a simple combination.  To add interest, she also does moves such as a ""hill climb"" (front lunge) combined with a rear glute lift.  She concludes the segment with a box squat/running man (knee repeater) sequence and a ""victory lap.""The second cardio segment, which is a bit longer at just over 16 minutes, is the Interval Walk.  Here Freytag alternates 2 minutes of low-impact walking moves with 30 seconds of a more intense, higher impact interval.  She continues to utilize very simple choreography, including knee ups, hamstring curls, heel touches, and half jacks.  Most of the moves are more athletic in nature, although Freytag does include a mambo at one point.  For the intervals, she offers the option of staying low-impact with Christine or taking it up with high knees, full jumping jacks, skiers, and the like.Freytag does a nice job of leading the short (11 minute) yoga practice.  She notes that because it can be a stand-alone workout, she includes some strength work, and so after the opening breathing, she moves right into chair and tree poses.  The standing work also includes forward bend, down dog, warrior 1, warrior 2, and side angle pose.  The finishing postures include cat/cow, boat, and reclined twist.  Although there was nothing wrong with this yoga routine, I didn't feel that the posture selection/sequencing worked particularly well as a cool-down to the cardio workouts, and it's rather short to be used on its on.Overall, I enjoyed the two cardio workouts on this DVD.  I definitely think that they would be great for beginners; Freytag is an encouraging instructor, the moves are basic yet fun and interesting, and the addition of the two different background exercisers allow the routines to be customized to one's specific level.  However, I am more of a high intermediate exerciser myself, and I found it to be a bit of a struggle to reach my target heart rate zone while using this DVD (I actually had to repeat the Power Walk to get my HR significantly elevated).  In addition, I had some reservations about the yoga portion as noted above; I would have preferred a shorter stretch routine that was more specific to the workouts.  But in the end, I did like both cardio workouts, and I would recommend the DVD.",4,Two easy cardio walking programs for beginners to low intermediates,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,3454,"['goal', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'Chris', 'Freytag', 'provide', 'various', 'workout', 'options', 'get', 'moving', 'day', 'two', 'weeks', 'hence', '2', 'Week', 'Turnaround', 'title', 'Freytag', 'two', 'cardio', 'walking', 'workouts', '15', 'minutes', 'long', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'together', 'separately', 'Yoga', 'Strength', 'segment', 'can', 'serve', 'cool-down', 'stand-alone', 'practice', 'Freytag', 'jointed', 'two', 'background', 'exercisers', 'Christine', 'Jessica', 'who', 'show', 'easier', 'harder', 'modifications', 'respectively', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'bright', 'indoor', 'studio', 'Prevention', 'logo', 'appearing', 'side', 'walls', 'Names', 'exercises', 'appear', 'bottom', 'screen', 'occur.The', 'first', 'cardio', 'workout', 'Power', 'Walk', 'just', '15', 'minutes', '2-minute', 'warm-up', 'simple', 'moves', 'shoulder', 'rolls', 'low', 'kicks', 'knee', 'ups', 'step', 'taps', 'Then', 'Freytag', 'Jessica', 'pick', 'up', 'weights', 'training', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'body', 'together', 'increase', 'cardio', 'effect', 'moves', 'are', 'easy-to-follow', 'e.g.', 'walk', 'forward', 'bicep', 'curls', 'knee', 'ups', 'shoulder', 'press', 'side', 'steps', 'shoulder', 'lifts', 'side', 'squats', 'Freytag', 'strings', 'together', 'simple', 'combination', 'add', 'interest', 'also', 'moves', 'such', 'hill', 'climb', 'front', 'lunge', 'combined', 'rear', 'glute', 'lift', 'segment', 'box', 'squat/running', 'man', 'knee', 'repeater', 'sequence', 'victory', 'lap', 'second', 'cardio', 'segment', 'bit', 'longer', 'just', '16', 'minutes', 'Interval', 'Walk', 'Here', 'Freytag', '2', 'minutes', 'low-impact', 'walking', 'moves', '30', 'seconds', 'more', 'intense', 'higher', 'impact', 'interval', 'utilize', 'very', 'simple', 'choreography', 'including', 'knee', 'ups', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'heel', 'touches', 'half', 'jacks', 'Most', 'moves', 'are', 'more', 'athletic', 'nature', 'Freytag', 'include', 'mambo', 'one', 'point', 'intervals', 'option', 'staying', 'low-impact', 'Christine', 'taking', 'up', 'high', 'knees', 'full', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'skiers', 'like.Freytag', 'nice', 'job', 'leading', 'short', '11', 'minute', 'yoga', 'practice', 'can', 'be', 'stand-alone', 'workout', 'strength', 'work', 'so', 'opening', 'breathing', 'right', 'chair', 'tree', 'poses', 'standing', 'work', 'also', 'forward', 'bend', 'down', 'dog', 'warrior', '1', 'warrior', '2', 'side', 'angle', 'pose', 'finishing', 'postures', 'include', 'cat/cow', 'boat', 'reclined', 'twist', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'yoga', 'routine', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'posture', 'selection/sequencing', 'worked', 'particularly', 'well', 'cool-down', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'rather', 'short', 'be', 'used', 'on.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'beginners', 'Freytag', 'encouraging', 'instructor', 'moves', 'are', 'basic', 'yet', 'fun', 'interesting', 'addition', 'two', 'different', 'background', 'exercisers', 'allow', 'routines', 'be', 'customized', 'one', 'specific', 'level', 'However', 'am', 'more', 'high', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'found', 'be', 'bit', 'struggle', 'reach', 'target', 'heart', 'rate', 'zone', 'using', 'DVD', 'actually', 'had', 'repeat', 'Power', 'Walk', 'get', 'HR', 'significantly', 'elevated', 'addition', 'had', 'reservations', 'yoga', 'portion', 'noted', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'shorter', 'stretch', 'routine', 'was', 'more', 'specific', 'workouts', 'end', 'did', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A

The DVD includes two 15 minute workouts.  The first includes weights for added resistance during the entire routine; the second is an interval workout with sets of 2 minutes of cardio, followed by 1 minute higher intensity intervals.  This one got my heart rate up and had a good variety of moves within each routine.  Chris is a lively instructor--motivating without being irritating.  Both workouts are low impact (basically walking type moves, but more challenging than some of Leslie Sansone's DVDs) and the two women she has with her demonstrate higher impact and lower impact variations.

She's very sweet and I find myself smiling.I'm not a high-impact fan of exercising. I do workout several times a week thought, mostly low-impact cardio and walking on a treadmill.You have two options, plus the yoga stretch at the end. The first one combines weights with your cardio. It's excellent! You're not flinging weights around, it's very controlled. The second option is a short-boost cardio. You do your routine and then add a short burst of cardio to get your heartrate up. I think anyone can do this. It's not bone jarring. The yoga stretch at the end was surprising delightful. It felt really good. I've taken yoga classes before and I still felt like this was 'right-on'. YOu don't need expereince with yoga - she'll guide you right through it.It is a great workout. It's become my staple workout. I do it 3-4 times a week and I recently added her 2-week turnaround strength. Sometimes I try to do both options but if I'm pressed for time I only do one or the other. I prefer the strength training with weights cardio. I feel really good after that.You won't regret this. Chris is a great motivator. I am a little creeped out by the snarling lady in the back but the other girls is very pleasant. :)",5,"Fast results, fun workout!",1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,1278,"['love', 'love', 'love', 'workout', 'Chris', 'so', 'nice', 'not', 'annoying', 'very', 'sweet', 'find', 'smiling.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'high-impact', 'fan', 'exercising', 'do', 'workout', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'thought', 'mostly', 'low-impact', 'cardio', 'walking', 'treadmill.You', 'have', 'two', 'options', 'yoga', 'stretch', 'end', 'first', 'one', 'combines', 'weights', 'cardio', 'excellent', ""'re"", 'not', 'flinging', 'weights', 'very', 'controlled', 'second', 'option', 'short-boost', 'cardio', 'do', 'routine', 'then', 'add', 'short', 'burst', 'cardio', 'get', 'heartrate', 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'bone', 'jarring', 'yoga', 'stretch', 'end', 'was', 'surprising', 'delightful', 'felt', 'really', 'good', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'yoga', 'classes', 'still', 'felt', 'was', ""'right-on"", 'YOu', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'expereince', 'yoga', ""'ll"", 'guide', 'right', 'it.It', 'great', 'workout', 'become', 'staple', 'workout', 'do', '3-4', 'times', 'week', 'recently', 'added', '2-week', 'turnaround', 'strength', 'Sometimes', 'try', 'do', 'options', ""'m"", 'pressed', 'time', 'only', 'do', 'one', 'other', 'prefer', 'strength', 'training', 'weights', 'cardio', 'feel', 'really', 'good', 'that.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'Chris', 'great', 'motivator', 'am', 'little', 'creeped', 'out', 'snarling', 'lady', 'back', 'other', 'girls', 'very', 'pleasant']",N/A
1283391,A157CXYX2S0L59,B002Q3N2C2,J. Youngman,"[20, 20]","I really like the variety of moves in this workout.  They're easy to do and very effective.  There are quite a bit of lunges so if you have bad knees, you might not like it.  Chris Freytag is an excellent instructor and cues well so it's very easy to follow along.  I like the fact that it's not old school of jumping around in high gear to the point that you can't catch your breath.  You will feel this workout but you won't be out of breath trying to keep up.  As I said, they're easy to do and very effective.I really like the first workout using light weights and you can increase the weights later to make it more challenging.  I also like how Chris Freytag explains the moves, such as lunging forward is like climbing hills.  She doesn't come off as being fake and most definitely is not annoying. The second workout is great too and you don't use hand weights.  I like doing BOTH workouts for a complete cardio routine and then follow it up with Prevention's ""The Abs Advantage"" workout.You can't go wrong with any of Chris Freytag's DVD's...she's GREAT and I have almost all of the Prevention DVD's that she instructs.",5,LOVE this workout!,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,1127,"['really', 'variety', 'moves', 'workout', ""'re"", 'easy', 'do', 'very', 'effective', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'lunges', 'so', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'might', 'not', 'Chris', 'Freytag', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'cues', 'well', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'along', 'fact', 'not', 'old', 'school', 'jumping', 'high', 'gear', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'breath', 'will', 'feel', 'workout', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'breath', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'said', ""'re"", 'easy', 'do', 'very', 'effective.I', 'really', 'first', 'workout', 'using', 'light', 'weights', 'can', 'increase', 'weights', 'later', 'make', 'more', 'challenging', 'also', 'how', 'Chris', 'Freytag', 'moves', 'such', 'lunging', 'forward', 'climbing', 'hills', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'being', 'fake', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'annoying', 'second', 'workout', 'great', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'hand', 'weights', 'doing', 'BOTH', 'workouts', 'complete', 'cardio', 'routine', 'then', 'follow', 'up', 'Prevention', 'Abs', 'Advantage', 'workout.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Chris', 'Freytag', 'DVD', 'GREAT', 'have', 'almost', 'Prevention', 'DVD']",N/A

Staley,"[0, 1]","This DVD is based on the premise that you can make significant changes in your fitness in two weeks based on the workouts on the DVD, which are supposed to be based on the most current research - or, the most current research when it was released.  I was surprised to find that these workouts are ""walking workouts"" with segments of intervals that are supposed to increase your fitness level quickly.Overall, I thought the quality of the actual walking workout was good.  There was a modifier and the instructor gives different options depending on your level.  Chris Freytag is one of the veteran instructors out there and has always been good at leading workouts and it shows.  And, the two background exercisers show good form while they demonstrate different options.However, I was surprised to see that the workout is only 30 minutes.  I know that in order for me to turn things around fitness wise that I need to include long cardio sessions.  The science behind the moves in this workout dvd are the latest ""hot"" concepts and don't necessarily apply to everyone equally.  So, if you're looking for a pretty good cardio workout that is eminently doable and kind of fun, check out this DVD.

It contains three sections, two that are fifteen minutes and one ten minute yoga stretch and cool down. One section is strength training combined with cardio and the second is interval training.  It combines everything I like and need in a work out session and runs close to 45 minutes which is long enough for me as I have fibromyalgia which really hurts if I work out too long and too hard.  Also this incorporates yoga which I have been doing since last february and cannot believe the difference in myself since taking up the practice.  I really like the instructor as she is very pretty and great personality and in her forties like me. She and two other ladies demonstrate three different levels so you can pick and choose the difficulty level ,so I would say that most people can do this no matter their fitness level. Really worth ordering! Its now June 1st 2013 and I thought I would make further comments as to this programs effectiveness and I have to say this is worth ordering and I would do it again as it is very effective if used regularly and changing your weights when needed as that is really what makes this effective. I have read reviews that say this is not for advanced exercisers but it is as all you have to do is use heavier weights as you become stronger and you will most certainly feel the difference.  I started with 3lb weights and now use 8lbs and let me tell you you can see the definition in my body and I feel great! When you up your weights your heartrate will go up and your muscles will also feel the burn. So dont decide this is not hard enough and just use heavier weights and up your game in the cardio section by putting your all into it and work out regularly as I find most people do not do what it takes and instead blame the program.",5,Just perfect!,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,1845,"['ordered', 'whim', 'am', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'three', 'sections', 'two', 'are', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'one', 'ten', 'minute', 'yoga', 'stretch', 'cool', 'down', 'One', 'section', 'strength', 'training', 'combined', 'cardio', 'second', 'interval', 'training', 'everything', 'like', 'need', 'work', 'out', 'session', 'close', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'enough', 'have', 'fibromyalgia', 'really', 'work', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'hard', 'Also', 'yoga', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'last', 'february', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'difference', 'taking', 'up', 'practice', 'really', 'instructor', 'very', 'pretty', 'great', 'personality', 'forties', 'two', 'other', 'ladies', 'demonstrate', 'three', 'different', 'levels', 'can', 'pick', 'choose', 'difficulty', 'level', 'would', 'say', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'matter', 'fitness', 'level', 'Really', 'worth', 'ordering', 'now', 'June', '1st', '2013', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'further', 'comments', 'programs', 'effectiveness', 'have', 'say', 'worth', 'ordering', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'very', 'effective', 'used', 'regularly', 'changing', 'weights', 'when', 'needed', 'really', 'what', 'effective', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'say', 'not', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'have', 'do', 'use', 'heavier', 'weights', 'become', 'stronger', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'feel', 'difference', 'started', '3lb', 'weights', 'now', 'use', '8lbs', 'let', 'tell', 'can', 'see', 'definition', 'body', 'feel', 'great', 'When', 'weights', 'heartrate', 'will', 'go', 'up', 'muscles', 'will', 'also', 'feel', 'burn', 'dont', 'decide', 'not', 'hard', 'enough', 'just', 'use', 'heavier', 'weights', 'up', 'game', 'cardio', 'section', 'putting', 'work', 'out', 'regularly', 'find', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'instead', 'blame', 'program']",N/A
