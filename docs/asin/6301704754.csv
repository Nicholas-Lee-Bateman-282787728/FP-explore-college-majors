262385,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,6301704754,A Customer,"[0, 5]","This movie centers around a widowed mother-of-two's struggle to keep her famly together. Lange annoys me to look at, but she does give a very good performance as a mother of two children who lose their father to an accident at work. A young Chris O'Donnel is her eldest son, who has a few really funny and sarcastic lines in the movie. His character plot involves building a romantic relationship with an older Joan Cusack, a nurse that he meets when his family moves to Baltimore. (Every teenager watching has to be wishing a woman like that would just throw herself at them as she does with Chris's character in the movie). To tell the truth I was falling asleep during the stupid scenes between Lange and Arlis Howard, who plays her new love interest in the move to the city. You wanna just reach in the screen and kick Kathy Bates out of the movie during her scenes, and I think Joan Cusack, (really the only reason worth watching the movie) doesnt have enough screen time as far as Im concerned. The movie is very sweet though, and if you can tolerate dead-air every now and then as you watch, its worth seeing. And I think you'll also favor the storyling between Joan and Chris O'Donnel.",4,"Hate Jessica Lange, Liked the Movie",984182400,"03 10, 2001",2001,1193,"['movie', 'widowed', 'mother-of-two', 'struggle', 'keep', 'famly', 'together', 'Lange', 'look', 'give', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'lose', 'father', 'accident', 'work', 'young', 'Chris', ""O'Donnel"", 'eldest', 'son', 'who', 'few', 'really', 'funny', 'sarcastic', 'lines', 'movie', 'character', 'plot', 'building', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'older', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'nurse', 'when', 'family', 'moves', 'Baltimore', 'Every', 'teenager', 'watching', 'be', 'wishing', 'woman', 'would', 'just', 'throw', 'Chris', 'character', 'movie', 'tell', 'truth', 'was', 'falling', 'asleep', 'stupid', 'scenes', 'Lange', 'Arlis', 'Howard', 'who', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'move', 'city', 'wan', 'na', 'just', 'reach', 'screen', 'kick', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'movie', 'scenes', 'think', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'watching', 'movie', 'doesnt', 'have', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'as', 'far', 'Im', 'concerned', 'movie', 'very', 'sweet', 'can', 'tolerate', 'dead-air', 'now', 'then', 'watch', 'worth', 'seeing', 'think', ""'ll"", 'also', 'favor', 'storyling', 'Joan', 'Chris', ""O'Donnel""]",Men Don't Leave VHS
262386,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301704754,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","There is an intimacy in `Men Don't Leave' that caught me off-guard and certainly made the film more palatable; that and the beautiful performance by Jessica Lange.  The film itself has no real surprise thrown in, for it mostly plays out rather predictably and uneventfully, unless you count that ridiculous yet somewhat wholly believable plot line involving Chris O'Donnell's affair with Joan Cusack (I love it when she pops up in a movie).No, `Men Don't Leave' is a rather small glimpse in at the life of a recently widowed woman raising two boys.  With little money to her name, she moves to Baltimore where her depression makes adjustment difficult and ultimately threatens the fabric of her family.  Couple that with the budding hormonal difficulties brought on by her eldest son (O'Donnell in his big screen debut) and the advances of a man who seems like a perfect fit and you have a tough time to be had by an emotionally vulnerable woman.Lange totally makes this film hers and she owns every frame.  She is such a talented actress, and this may be one of her finest moments; such tenderness and emotional conveyance in small moments.  That is something I really respected about this film, for as much as it doesn't `go a lot of places' it manages to feel sincere and earnest; something that a lot of films fail to capture.  There is a scene with O'Donnell and Arliss Howard where your heart begins to break over the amount of raw honesty projected; so open and naked and vulnerable.  Director Paul Brickman uses a deft hand at creating an intimate feeling that permeates the film, even when certain moments begin to fray.  Lange, Cusack, Howard, O'Donnell (his first and best performance, by miles) and Bates lend memorable and commendable performances and help make `Men Don't Leave' an underappreciated must-see film that very few have seen.Oh, and Thomas Newman's score is fantastic.If you can, make the time to see this one!",4,"Lange won't leave my mind, and neither will this film...",1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,1936,"['intimacy', 'Men', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Leave', 'caught', 'off-guard', 'certainly', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'palatable', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'film', 'real', 'surprise', 'thrown', 'mostly', 'out', 'rather', 'predictably', 'uneventfully', 'count', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'wholly', 'believable', 'plot', 'line', 'involving', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'affair', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'love', 'when', 'up', 'movie', '.No', 'Men', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Leave', 'rather', 'small', 'glimpse', 'life', 'recently', 'widowed', 'woman', 'raising', 'two', 'boys', 'little', 'money', 'name', 'Baltimore', 'where', 'depression', 'adjustment', 'difficult', 'ultimately', 'fabric', 'family', 'Couple', 'budding', 'hormonal', 'difficulties', 'brought', 'eldest', 'son', ""O'Donnell"", 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'advances', 'man', 'who', 'perfect', 'fit', 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'be', 'had', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'woman.Lange', 'totally', 'film', 'hers', 'frame', 'such', 'talented', 'actress', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'moments', 'such', 'tenderness', 'emotional', 'conveyance', 'small', 'moments', 'something', 'really', 'respected', 'film', 'as', 'much', ""n't"", 'go', 'lot', 'places', 'feel', 'sincere', 'earnest', 'something', 'lot', 'films', 'fail', 'capture', 'scene', ""O'Donnell"", 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'where', 'heart', 'break', 'amount', 'raw', 'honesty', 'projected', 'open', 'naked', 'vulnerable', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Brickman', 'deft', 'hand', 'creating', 'intimate', 'feeling', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'certain', 'moments', 'begin', 'fray', 'Lange', 'Cusack', 'Howard', ""O'Donnell"", 'first', 'best', 'performance', 'miles', 'Bates', 'lend', 'memorable', 'commendable', 'performances', 'help', 'make', 'Men', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Leave', 'underappreciated', 'must-see', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'have', 'seen.Oh', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'score', 'fantastic.If', 'can', 'make', 'time', 'see', 'one']",Men Don't Leave VHS
262387,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,6301704754,Don R. Holloway,"[2, 2]","This is a movie about a woman (Jessica Lange) and her two sons, ages 17 and 9, played by Chris O'Donnell and Charlie Korsmo, respectively. When Lange's character loses her husband in an accident, she is forced to move, with her two sons, to a cheaper place in inner-city Baltimore. All three members of the family are trying to grieve and cope in their own way with this tragedy, though not always successfully. (For instance, at the funeral, someone tells Korsmo's character that it's okay to cry. The boy replies coldly, ""No, I'm not going to cry."") Ironically, at a time when they all need each other the most, they end up becoming more separated through their own poor decisions, bad judgment, and their sheer confusion over what is the best thing to do. At times, this movie was funny, such as in some of the wacky scenes with a neighbor, played by Joan Cusack. And don't miss the great turn by Kathy Bates as Lange's boss. At other times, the film was just downright heartbreaking, as in the scene with O'Donnell on the dock with Arliss Howard, and for me, the scene near the end with Lange and Charlie Korsmo (a truly brilliant actor), at their old home where Korsmo had run away to. In my view, this is a truly great film. Executive producer and director Paul Brickman has fashioned a real gem in ""Men Don't Leave"". This is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time, because the situation is timeless and human emotion is eternal. Finally, I think it is a travesty that such a brilliant film did not get a DVD release (although the Warner Archive Collection has made the film available in a DVD-R version).

At this point her two boys become more affected by the new surroundings as each crave for the attention left by the oid of their late father.

The influence of both O'Donnel's and Lange's romantic relationships are quite unique as well. In spite of some rebelious attitudes by all, the bonds of family seem to stand strong.

Charlie Korsmo is heartbreaking as the sensitive younger son trying desperately to bring his Mom back to life. Arliss Howard plays the sweet musician that comes into her life quite by accident.

262391,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,6301704754,Marc Cabir Davis,"[0, 10]","This film recommends itself so strongly to you that you feel the need to reach out and strangle it and cry 'STOP!' With a luscious cast including Jessica Lange, Joan Cusack, Chris O'Donnell and Kathy Bates, one would think that this would endear itself more than it ultimately did. Sadly though, despite being a terrific feature in terms of acting, I would have to agree with critic Ebert in saying that it finally falls under the weight of its' own ugly cliches.Jessica Lange loses her husband in the first few minutes of the film, and a host of Chinese cooks get to witness her pain after her trip to the morgue (Lange later dreams about the cooks, though I can't imagine why). Her eldest son, played by a youthful Chris O'Donnell (whos supposed to be 17 here, but looks 13) is a snotty brat who wants to be 'man of the house' now that Daddys dead. Her youngest, played by Charlie Korsmo (a has been who could've been - he was also that boring child in 'Dick Tracy') is sweet enough and likeable, but the vapid script soon makes it hard to care about any of these people.Lange wastes no time finding a new boyfriend in Baltimore. This was highly expected of course, and coming as it does just 25 minutes into the film, it marks the beginning of the end of this movie. Lange is a superb actress and tries to do things with her role that could possibly inject it with SOME kind of interest, but like all the others, she too stumbles. The only thing really worth watching here is Joan Cusack who plays a nurse living above the Lange family. She and Chris get it off, much to Lange's puzzlement and dismay, yet it is she who finally brings some sort of sanity into Lange's life (after a series of predictable cliches, of course).All this goes to show that it is the weird who help the 'normal', I suppose. Whatever. The point is, this film starts so well and ends so tamely, and the director is to blame. How else could you explain the brilliant Kathy Bates utterly wasted as the owner of an exclusive Italian eatery? She has the minimal of lines, and barely begins to make a presence before the film ends. Disappointing.Chris O'Donnell is impressive as the eldest son, though its easy to sleepwalk through such a role. His wooden-facedness makes it that much more tasklesss for him to achieve perfection in this part. Lange, as usual, does more for her character than any of the others, and Cusack is hilarious, though I wondered what she was doing in this film at all. And it was quite a relief to find that O'Donnell's character was supposed to be 17 in this movie - I was a trifle startled to see Cusack jump his bones, for she looked like she could be 30, and he really looks pre-teen like in this film. Oh well.This is a good watch, and while certainly not as 'essential' as this website says it is, it does have its moments. Pity that the cliches got in the way of everything. Heres a spoiler : as usual, the child gets hurt, and this in turn brings the family together. Ho hum.

This movie is a whirlwind of emotions. You watch the disintigration and the ultimate piecing back together of a family in trama. I found this movie to be funny, sad, hopeful, depressing, joyous and pretty much a reflection of life as it really is.Jessica Lange, who I have always thought was a phenomenal actress (barring King Kong days; hey a girl has to work) deserves much more lauds for her work than she receives, out does herself in this movie. Anything Kathy Bates is in pretty much a shoe in for entertainment. Joan Cusack is also outstanding in this as well, playing the self determined, I do things my kind of way, love interest to Chris O'Donnell, her performance is quirky and brings the character to life in the few short scenes she actually has in the movie.Chris O'Donnell and Charlie Korsmo are integral to beauty and tragedy of the story line.

He plays a divorced father of a child that he only sees marginally, and though he is interested in Lange's character, he just doesn't know how to get his arms around the whole situation.All and all, this movie will get to you, get under your skin if you have any heart at all and will make you want to see it again and again.",5,Men Don't Leave,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,1462,"['can', 'say', 'where', 'do', 'sign', 'up', 'vote', 'have', 'movie', 'extras', 'can', 'dig', 'up', 'put', 'DVD', 'movie', 'whirlwind', 'emotions', 'watch', 'disintigration', 'ultimate', 'piecing', 'back', 'together', 'family', 'trama', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'funny', 'sad', 'hopeful', 'depressing', 'joyous', 'pretty', 'much', 'reflection', 'life', 'really', 'is.Jessica', 'Lange', 'who', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'actress', 'barring', 'King', 'Kong', 'days', 'girl', 'work', 'much', 'more', 'lauds', 'work', 'out', 'movie', 'Anything', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'pretty', 'much', 'shoe', 'entertainment', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'also', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'self', 'determined', 'do', 'things', 'kind', 'way', 'love', 'interest', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'performance', 'quirky', 'character', 'life', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'actually', 'movie.Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'are', 'integral', 'beauty', 'tragedy', 'story', 'line', 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'not', 'often', 'mention', 'when', 'talking', 'movie', 'play', 'accordian', 'pumping', 'new', 'age', 'musician', 'who', 'lives', 'family', 'doing', 'crash', 'burn', 'divorced', 'father', 'child', 'only', 'marginally', 'interested', 'Lange', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'get', 'arms', 'whole', 'situation.All', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'get', 'skin', 'have', 'heart', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again']",Men Don't Leave VHS

262399,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6301704754,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","***spoiler alert***This is a wonderful film about how a family adapts to brutal upheaval:  after the sudden death of the father, his family is left without resources and is forced into a lower class, moving from the suburbs to a gritty city.  The mother, who is played with extraordinary sensitivity by Lange, watches as she begins to lose control of her children; she feels responsible and tries to handle things on her own, but feels she is failing.  The youngest boy gets into petty crime with a worthless friends, while his older brother begins an affair with an older neighbor.  I was astonished to witness Lange as her life and self-image descended into chaos as she tried so hard to cope, to make enough money, to become tougher, and to keep her family together.  In perhaps her best film performance, Lange is completely believable as she heads toward a nervous breakdown.  In the end, they all adapt and to a certain extent, grow and reach a new place.  Kathy Bates, as the tough and occasionally mean shop owner, is also excellent, as is Joan Cusack (a lucky find as a natural caregiver), and O'Donnell in his first major role.I think that this is particularly relevant now, in these troubled economic times.  Just about any of us could end up in this place.Warmly recommended.
