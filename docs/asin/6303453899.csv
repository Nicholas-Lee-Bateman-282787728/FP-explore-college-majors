Director David Jones didn't get the best out of veteran actors Keith Carradine, and Donald Moffat either. The characters appear staged and their reactions exaggerated. The storyline is very stereotypical and lacks depth. Actress Genia Michaela gives a surprisingly good performance even though her character is the typical good girl gone bad, who redeems herself in the end. The image quality of the DVD is very grainy and the audio has a slight hiss in the background.",1,Don't waste your time or money,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,582,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'many', 'other', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'movies', 'made-for-tv', 'production', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'talents', 'Director', 'David', 'Jones', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'best', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Donald', 'Moffat', 'either', 'characters', 'appear', 'staged', 'reactions', 'exaggerated', 'storyline', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'depth', 'Actress', 'Genia', 'Michaela', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'even', 'character', 'typical', 'good', 'girl', 'gone', 'bad', 'who', 'end', 'image', 'quality', 'DVD', 'very', 'grainy', 'audio', 'slight', 'hiss', 'background']",Is There Life Out There VHS

It's a kind hearted story about a woman who gets a second chance at life and ways of living it. Lili Marshall ( McEntire ) has a brush with death ( cancer ) and decides to live her life to the fullest once she is out of the clear. She's been a housewife for years, doing all she could for her husband Brad ( Carradine ) and her two children. It doesn't help that her younger sister ( Belle ) is a pain in the butt. Lili also works long hours in a diner and she hardly finds time for herself. She decides to go back to school. School opens a sea of horizans for Lili. She takes to her classes well while being befriended by the handsome young teaching assistant Joshua ( Mitchell Anderson ) who is more than eager to help Lili with her schoolwork.  Lili's new life puts a strain on Brad and once her father dies she's at her wits' end. She ends up having to choose between her old life and school. She makes the brave choice of continuing school. She is determined to see it through no matter how Brad feels. Her life couldn't get any better until she's thrown into a frightening reality during a study date with Joshua. He has more than "" friendly "" feelings for Lili. When she rejects him he doesn't take no for an answer but luckily Lili gets away. Now being almost raped, she struggles ( again ) with the choice of returning to class and to Joshua's haunting behavior. She does and proves to everyone she can win in the end.This is a delightful film. Reba takes you on a fantastic and sad journey. It is hard to be a woman with priorites, but Lili Marshall proves that life's hardships often lead to its rewards.",4,Reba Rules and Keith's the King,1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,1767,"['two', 'super', 'actors', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'Keith', 'Carradine', ""n't"", 'much', 'can', 'go', 'wrong.I', 'saw', 'film', '94', 'CBS', 'fell', 'love', 'kind', 'hearted', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'ways', 'living', 'Lili', 'Marshall', 'McEntire', 'brush', 'death', 'cancer', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'once', 'clear', 'been', 'housewife', 'years', 'doing', 'could', 'husband', 'Brad', 'Carradine', 'two', 'children', ""n't"", 'help', 'younger', 'sister', 'Belle', 'pain', 'butt', 'Lili', 'also', 'long', 'hours', 'diner', 'hardly', 'time', 'herself', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'School', 'sea', 'horizans', 'Lili', 'classes', 'well', 'being', 'befriended', 'handsome', 'young', 'teaching', 'assistant', 'Joshua', 'Mitchell', 'Anderson', 'who', 'more', 'eager', 'help', 'Lili', 'schoolwork', 'Lili', 'new', 'life', 'strain', 'Brad', 'once', 'father', 'wits', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'choose', 'old', 'life', 'school', 'brave', 'choice', 'continuing', 'school', 'determined', 'see', 'matter', 'how', 'Brad', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'thrown', 'frightening', 'reality', 'study', 'date', 'Joshua', 'more', 'friendly', 'feelings', 'Lili', 'When', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'luckily', 'Lili', 'away', 'Now', 'being', 'almost', 'raped', 'again', 'choice', 'returning', 'class', 'Joshua', 'haunting', 'behavior', 'everyone', 'can', 'win', 'end.This', 'delightful', 'film', 'Reba', 'fantastic', 'sad', 'journey', 'hard', 'be', 'woman', 'priorites', 'Lili', 'Marshall', 'life', 'hardships', 'often', 'lead', 'rewards']",Is There Life Out There VHS
