Sure enough, these two have all the man power, but non of the luck and brains to get it done...or are they being under estimated.

I'm still un-decided exactly where it fits in between the two.  The story is certainly an interesting concept, albeit creepy.  Melissa Keller is certainly sexy and the few sequences where she is ""alive"" are quite memorable.  However, these scenes could have been done better, if you ask me.If you're into comedies about people who brush up against the mob (or mobster-like characters), this one might be worth a watch.

And you like Jason Lee.But... this sounds like it could be a really dumb, banal comedy. And the reviews aren't so hot. So should you bother with it?That's what I was mulling over before I finally bit the bullet and rented it. And I'm glad I did.First and foremost, Glover and Lee are fantastic. They carry the movie. They're in top form here, and they create two wonderful bozo characters.There is some very funny material, and some great, even classic, lines. I laughed out loud several times. And the story zips right along, doesn't get tedious or slow.Having said that, it's a pretty conventional, routine storyline, despite many detours into inspired craziness. And some of it is kinda dumb or obvious.This isn't risky or edgy material. But it is fun, funny viewing, with outstanding weirdo performances by Glover and Lee.",4,If you like Crispin Glover and/or Jason Lee,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,916,"['So', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'especially', 'wilder', 'more', 'eccentric', 'roles', 'like', 'Jason', 'Lee.But', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'dumb', 'banal', 'comedy', 'reviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'hot', 'So', 'should', 'bother', 'what', 'was', 'mulling', 'finally', 'bit', 'bullet', 'rented', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.First', 'foremost', 'Glover', 'Lee', 'are', 'fantastic', 'carry', 'movie', ""'re"", 'top', 'form', 'here', 'create', 'two', 'wonderful', 'bozo', 'very', 'funny', 'material', 'great', 'even', 'classic', 'lines', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'several', 'times', 'story', 'zips', 'right', 'along', ""n't"", 'get', 'tedious', 'slow.Having', 'said', 'pretty', 'conventional', 'routine', 'storyline', 'many', 'detours', 'inspired', 'craziness', 'kinda', 'dumb', 'obvious.This', ""n't"", 'risky', 'edgy', 'material', 'fun', 'funny', 'viewing', 'outstanding', 'weirdo', 'performances', 'Glover', 'Lee']",Drop Dead Sexy

They dig up a dead woman to steal her necklace and end up ""kidnapping"" her and holding her for ransom from her husband. Supposedly, hilarity ensues, but I must have missed that part.Crispin Glover creates a very believable, original, and funny small-town hick, but it feels like Jason Lee isn't even trying, and the movie definitely suffers from that.There's a good amount of gratuitous nudity in several scenes that take place in the local strip club (The Mean-Eyed Pussy Cat) and even in the morgue. If you're looking for nudity go for this movie. If you're looking for anything else, don't bother.Overall this movie moves along slowly and without too many laughs.
