1596316,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B009GCIIKM,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","It&#8217;s not that movies like CREEP VAN don&#8217;t take horror seriously, it&#8217;s that I can&#8217;t take the horror seriously in movies like CREEP VAN.The premise is simple enough.  A down on his luck guy, Campbell Jackson, back in town, trying to make his way in the world, gets a job at a car wash.  He&#8217;s taking the bus to and from work, but he desperately wants to buy a car.  He sees a van for sale and calls about buying it.  The owner calls back and yells at him.  Campbell says forget it and moves on with his life, which includes dating the girl who works the front desk at the car wash.  Meanwhile, the owner of the van is going around town killing people with his booby trapped vehicle.  The seatbealt is rigged to tighten around whoever is clicked into the seat, there&#8217;s a spiked hammer that swings up from the rear of the seat, a knife that shoots out of the seat back, spikes sticking out of the air bag, and the window works as a guillotine.As the guy becomes more obsessed with harassing Campbell, our hero is less and less interested in buying the van.  But when his best friend is killed, then his girlfriend kidnapped, he has to do something to stop the murderous van owner.See, with a title like CREEP VAN and a synopsis that includes the phrase &#8220;booby trapped van&#8221;, I&#8217;m thinking of something like a miniature version of THE COLLECTOR, or something akin to the SAW movies.  I was pretty excited to watch this movie.  Until I watched it and saw it&#8217;s not being played for terror, but for laughs.  Not that CREEP VAN is made to be a knee-slapper, but it&#8217;s definitely more silliness than horror.The tone is way too light, the kills are ridiculously far-fetched, and the acting from the supporting cast was so over the top all around it had to be on purpose.I wanted to champion this movie, and instead I find myself wondering what I just did with the last 84 minutes and how my life has gone so completely off track.Brian Kolodziej as Campbell does what he can with the material, but writer and director Jim Bartoo and Scott McKinley, respectively, are obviously just goofing around.  You&#8217;d think with the subject matter, they could have at least pretended to be taking this seriously.  Instead, I felt, at times, like I was watching a spoof and expected, at any moment, for someone to say, &#8220;I am serious.  And don&#8217;t call me Shirley.&#8221;The gore was pretty impressive--all the more reason it&#8217;s too bad CREEP VAN was more comedy than horror--and the kills, while dumb, at least played well on camera.  The climax was a shock for all of 30 seconds, but then played out exactly how you&#8217;d expect it to given what happens in a very tense moment during the final fight.  While I was sort of let down by how obvious that ending was, there was a minute or two when you feel a hopelessness pressing in on you and it feels like such a bigger moment than it really is by virtue of the fact it&#8217;s the ONLY really dark moment of the entire movie.  Unfortunately, it&#8217;s too little, too late.CREEP VAN does its namesake proud by luring you in with the promise of what you want--in this case a decent horror movie--and instead giving you something you weren&#8217;t the least bit interested.  While I&#8217;m not SORRY I watched it, I certainly can&#8217;t recommend it to anyone else, without the warning that, if you like your horror movies with a serious tone, this isn&#8217;t the one for you.",3,Creep Van,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,3488,"['8217', 'not', 'movies', 'CREEP', 'VAN', 'don', '8217', 't', 'take', 'horror', 'seriously', '8217', 'can', '8217', 'take', 'horror', 'seriously', 'movies', 'CREEP', 'VAN.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'enough', 'down', 'luck', 'guy', 'Campbell', 'Jackson', 'back', 'town', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'world', 'job', 'car', 'wash.', '8217', 'taking', 'bus', 'work', 'desperately', 'buy', 'car', 'van', 'sale', 'buying', 'owner', 'back', 'yells', 'Campbell', 'forget', 'moves', 'life', 'dating', 'girl', 'who', 'front', 'desk', 'car', 'wash', 'Meanwhile', 'owner', 'van', 'going', 'around', 'town', 'killing', 'people', 'booby', 'trapped', 'vehicle', 'seatbealt', 'rigged', 'tighten', 'around', 'whoever', 'clicked', 'seat', '8217', 's', 'spiked', 'hammer', 'swings', 'up', 'rear', 'seat', 'knife', 'seat', 'back', 'spikes', 'sticking', 'air', 'bag', 'window', 'guillotine.As', 'guy', 'more', 'obsessed', 'harassing', 'Campbell', 'hero', 'less', 'less', 'interested', 'buying', 'van', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'killed', 'then', 'girlfriend', 'kidnapped', 'do', 'something', 'stop', 'murderous', 'van', 'owner.See', 'title', 'CREEP', 'VAN', 'synopsis', 'phrase', '8220', 'trapped', 'van', '8221', '8217', 'thinking', 'something', 'miniature', 'version', 'THE', 'COLLECTOR', 'something', 'akin', 'SAW', 'movies', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'watch', 'movie', 'watched', 'saw', '8217', 'not', 'being', 'played', 'terror', 'laughs', 'Not', 'CREEP', 'VAN', 'made', 'be', 'knee-slapper', '8217', 'definitely', 'more', 'silliness', 'horror.The', 'tone', 'way', 'too', 'light', 'kills', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'far-fetched', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'so', 'top', 'had', 'be', 'purpose.I', 'wanted', 'champion', 'movie', 'instead', 'find', 'wondering', 'what', 'just', 'did', 'last', '84', 'minutes', 'how', 'life', 'gone', 'so', 'completely', 'track.Brian', 'Kolodziej', 'Campbell', 'what', 'can', 'material', 'writer', 'director', 'Jim', 'Bartoo', 'Scott', 'McKinley', 'respectively', 'are', 'obviously', 'just', 'goofing', 'around', '8217', 'think', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'pretended', 'be', 'taking', 'seriously', 'Instead', 'felt', 'times', 'was', 'watching', 'spoof', 'expected', 'moment', 'someone', 'say', '8220', 'am', 'serious', 'don', '8217', 'call', 'Shirley.', '8221', 'gore', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'more', 'reason', '8217', 's', 'too', 'bad', 'CREEP', 'VAN', 'was', 'more', 'comedy', 'horror', 'kills', 'dumb', 'least', 'played', 'well', 'camera', 'climax', 'was', 'shock', '30', 'seconds', 'then', 'played', 'out', 'exactly', 'how', '8217', 'expect', 'given', 'what', 'very', 'tense', 'moment', 'final', 'fight', 'was', 'sort', 'let', 'down', 'how', 'obvious', 'ending', 'was', 'was', 'minute', 'two', 'when', 'feel', 'hopelessness', 'pressing', 'bigger', 'moment', 'really', 'virtue', 'fact', '8217', 's', 'ONLY', 'really', 'dark', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', '8217', 's', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late.CREEP', 'VAN', 'namesake', 'proud', 'luring', 'promise', 'what', 'want', 'case', 'decent', 'horror', 'movie', 'instead', 'giving', 'something', 'weren', '8217', 'least', 'bit', 'interested', '8217', 'not', 'SORRY', 'watched', 'certainly', 'can', '8217', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'else', 'warning', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'serious', 'tone', 'isn', '8217', 'one']",Creep Van

Who didn't like the so bad and cheesy slasher flicks of the 80's. I was but a young lad when i got my first glimpse of the wonderful world of 80's slasher. I remember watching Nightmare 4&5 in the movie theatre. Silent Night Deadly Night was rented once around Christmas time when i was three or so. That movie still sticks with me and became a Christmas tradition with me. So you get my point. I'm glad they are doing throwback films of the 80's. This movie reminds me of that time. It didn't seem too different from the vhs movies my parents would rent and watch. I could imagine watching this back in 1985 and it would just feel the same. Pick this movie up if you love the horror movies of the 80's. But don't take it too seriously or you won't enjoy it. Two things that stick out in my head is this one scene where the lead guy Campbell i think his name is pictures himself buying The Creep Van. And then picking up this girl he works with and parking by the beach. Things are getting good and then the girl in the passenger seat becomes a dude. He snaps out of that daydream and is like ""what the hell was that."" Anyways i think that is what the scene was suppose to be and it's funny. Another scene that sticks out for me is at the end the villian sticks his head into the window of the Creep Van and our main guy closes the window on him effectively slicing off his face. That scene was great and i believe it will stick out for you too. There are many many more hilarious moments that i won't spoil for you.
