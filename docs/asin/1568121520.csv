We have the married daughter, Suzanne-Jennifer Beals- who is pregnant with a gay baby.  Her husband and her father basically want her to have an abortion.  She and her mother are deeply torn over what to do.  (Faye Dunaway does a really good job portraying the mother of a gay son.  It is obvious that she loves her son, but his lifestyle is very disturbing to her.)  Suzanne does not want David to know that she is considering having an abortion because the baby is gay, but the mother tells him anyway.  This is where the major melodrama enters.  Although, it is understandable that David would be upset that the members of his family are seriously considering that it would be a good thing for Suzanne to abort her baby just because he is gay--because then he has to wonder: &quot;well would they have aborted me if they had known that I was going to end up gay.&quot;  When he asks his parents what they would have done if they had known in his situation, he gets a very hurtful response from his father and an ambivalent and non-straight-forward answer from his mother.  This is of course very painful for David and he basically cuts off all contact with his family at this point.Suzanne's husband comes off as the real jerk in this movie because he does not act at all sympathetic or understanding of the emotional turmoil and trauma that his wife is going through while she is trying to decide what is the best/right thing to do.  The mother and father, while they are having a very hard time dealing with their son's lifestyle are still portrayed in a sympathetic manner.  Suzanne is portrayed in a very realistic manner.  It would be hard for any mother to deal with the knowledge that the baby she is carrying is gay--which raises what I see as being the main issue of the movie--that we should never actually develop and use this kind of technology--where we can tell whether or not a baby will be gay before it is born.  This is definitely a case where ignorance is bliss, therefore, it is definitely best not to know.I just really liked this movie because it is a very thoughtful and touching movie that raises many issues that society needs to deal with.  Brendan Fraser is adorable in this movie, and I also really liked his boyfriend-he was sweet and supportive.",5,Really good movie--It is a little melodramatic though.,988329600,"04 27, 2001",2001,2558,"['Even', 'premise', 'movie', 'scientists', 'can', 'test', 'unborn', 'fetus', 'gene', 'homosexuality', 'not', 'possible', 'current', 'scientific', 'technology', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'movie.In', 'Gold', 'Family', 'have', 'son', 'David-Brendan', 'Fraser-who', 'gay', 'have', 'married', 'daughter', 'Suzanne-Jennifer', 'Beals-', 'who', 'pregnant', 'gay', 'baby', 'husband', 'father', 'basically', 'want', 'have', 'abortion', 'mother', 'are', 'deeply', 'torn', 'over', 'what', 'do', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'mother', 'gay', 'son', 'obvious', 'son', 'lifestyle', 'very', 'disturbing', 'Suzanne', 'not', 'want', 'David', 'know', 'considering', 'having', 'abortion', 'baby', 'gay', 'mother', 'anyway', 'where', 'major', 'melodrama', 'enters', 'understandable', 'David', 'would', 'be', 'upset', 'members', 'family', 'are', 'seriously', 'considering', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'Suzanne', 'abort', 'baby', 'just', 'gay', 'then', 'wonder', 'quot', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'aborted', 'had', 'known', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'gay.', 'quot', 'When', 'parents', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'had', 'known', 'situation', 'very', 'hurtful', 'response', 'father', 'ambivalent', 'non-straight-forward', 'answer', 'mother', 'course', 'very', 'painful', 'David', 'basically', 'contact', 'family', 'point.Suzanne', 'husband', 'off', 'real', 'jerk', 'movie', 'not', 'act', 'sympathetic', 'understanding', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'trauma', 'wife', 'going', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'best/right', 'thing', 'do', 'mother', 'father', 'are', 'having', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'son', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'still', 'portrayed', 'sympathetic', 'manner', 'Suzanne', 'portrayed', 'very', 'realistic', 'manner', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'mother', 'deal', 'knowledge', 'baby', 'carrying', 'gay', 'what', 'see', 'being', 'main', 'issue', 'movie', 'should', 'never', 'actually', 'develop', 'use', 'kind', 'technology', 'where', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'baby', 'will', 'be', 'gay', 'born', 'definitely', 'case', 'where', 'ignorance', 'bliss', 'therefore', 'definitely', 'best', 'not', 'know.I', 'just', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'touching', 'movie', 'many', 'issues', 'society', 'deal', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'adorable', 'movie', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'boyfriend-he', 'was', 'sweet', 'supportive']",N/A
184946,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,1568121520,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","TWILIGHT OF THE GOLDS (1996, release date 1997, 92 minutes) is an amazingly strange drama that seemed focused on a couple of very sharp points: is it or is it not OK to be gay, to have an abortion and to start thinking in terms of eugenics? Especially when the family in question is composed of liberal Jews? This films asks all these questions.Rob (Jon Tenney) and Suzanne (Jennifer Beals in what I suspect was a comeback attempt for her) are expecting a baby - oh happy day. Through some silly cinemagic I do not understand, they have a genetic test done on their baby (Rob is a DNA scientist don't you know). When they discover the baby boy is also going to be gay (THE LAVENDER GENE!! THEY FOUND IT IN THE MID-90S??) ... well the explosions begin!Suzanne's folks Walter (Gary Marshall, as bad as ever) and Phyllis Gold (Faye Dunaway, or should we nickname her ""Fade"") hit the ceiling when they find out about the baby. They are the meaning behind the extremely silly title which could have helped had it been something really cool. Why should they be at this terrible impasse? Liberal Jews, remember? Well enter a young and long-haired Brendan Fraser as David Gold, Suzanne's kid brother. See, he's gay and I think he has AIDS (that detail was never clear for me).This film burrows deeply into queries that I think we all must contemplate. Suzanne, traumatized apparently by the gayness of the kid brother she always loved and cherished, considers having an abortion. Heaven knows her husband is fine with that, and I don't think the Old Golds struggle too much with it since their son actually disgusts them. Trouble is, gay boy or abortion? Gay boy, or abortion? Jews know all about eugenics, yet here they are, needlessly torturing themselves and the storyline.You really must see this, though it gives off the heavy odor of After School Special crap and the acting is half-baked at best. This was Fraser's 6th theatrical film and I think out of all of them he had only been noticed in exactly one (his debut, ENCINO MAN). Everyone else is simply painting an absurdist conundrum to make us think - and think hard.That is the beauty of this storyline. You can shout at the screen (as I did again and again), mock the silliness of it all (it was the 90s, hadn't we gotten over this level of homophobia yet?) and even heave something at the characters onscreen. But I tell you, if you study this patiently and think about the questions it poses, you'll find yourself sucked into a similar vortex of pain, confusion and pre-grief pangs.While this is never going to be my favorite gay-themed film, in spite of some good brave scenes between Fraser and his boyfriend (I forget his name, but Rosie O'Donnell makes a nice couple of cameo appearances) ... I highly recommend at least one viewing. You'd be surprised at how some silly eugenics ideas can get you thinking seriously.And may I add: this film was somewhat ahead of its time. Too bad it did not rise to its inherent challenge.",3,Three stars for a stunning premise ... even if it fell FLAT,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,2985,"['TWILIGHT', 'THE', 'GOLDS', '1996', 'release', 'date', '1997', '92', 'minutes', 'amazingly', 'strange', 'drama', 'seemed', 'focused', 'couple', 'very', 'sharp', 'points', 'not', 'OK', 'be', 'gay', 'have', 'abortion', 'start', 'thinking', 'terms', 'eugenics', 'Especially', 'when', 'family', 'question', 'composed', 'liberal', 'Jews', 'films', 'questions.Rob', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'Suzanne', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'what', 'suspect', 'was', 'comeback', 'attempt', 'are', 'expecting', 'baby', 'oh', 'happy', 'day', 'silly', 'cinemagic', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'have', 'genetic', 'test', 'done', 'baby', 'Rob', 'DNA', 'scientist', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'When', 'discover', 'baby', 'boy', 'also', 'going', 'be', 'gay', 'LAVENDER', 'GENE', 'THEY', 'FOUND', 'IT', 'IN', 'THE', 'MID-90S', 'well', 'explosions', 'begin', 'Suzanne', 'folks', 'Walter', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'as', 'bad', 'ever', 'Phyllis', 'Gold', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'should', 'nickname', 'Fade', 'hit', 'ceiling', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'baby', 'are', 'meaning', 'extremely', 'silly', 'title', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'had', 'been', 'something', 'really', 'cool', 'Why', 'should', 'be', 'terrible', 'impasse', 'Liberal', 'Jews', 'remember', 'Well', 'young', 'long-haired', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'David', 'Gold', 'Suzanne', 'kid', 'brother', 'See', 'gay', 'think', 'AIDS', 'detail', 'was', 'never', 'clear', '.This', 'film', 'burrows', 'deeply', 'queries', 'think', 'must', 'contemplate', 'Suzanne', 'traumatized', 'apparently', 'gayness', 'kid', 'brother', 'always', 'loved', 'cherished', 'considers', 'having', 'abortion', 'Heaven', 'husband', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Old', 'Golds', 'struggle', 'too', 'much', 'son', 'actually', 'Trouble', 'gay', 'boy', 'abortion', 'Gay', 'boy', 'abortion', 'Jews', 'know', 'eugenics', 'yet', 'here', 'are', 'needlessly', 'torturing', 'storyline.You', 'really', 'must', 'see', 'heavy', 'odor', 'School', 'Special', 'crap', 'acting', 'half-baked', 'best', 'was', 'Fraser', '6th', 'theatrical', 'film', 'think', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'noticed', 'exactly', 'one', 'debut', 'ENCINO', 'MAN', 'Everyone', 'else', 'simply', 'painting', 'absurdist', 'conundrum', 'make', 'think', 'think', 'hard.That', 'beauty', 'storyline', 'can', 'shout', 'screen', 'did', 'again', 'again', 'silliness', 'was', '90s', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'over', 'level', 'homophobia', 'yet', 'even', 'heave', 'something', 'characters', 'onscreen', 'tell', 'study', 'patiently', 'think', 'questions', ""'ll"", 'find', 'sucked', 'similar', 'vortex', 'pain', 'confusion', 'pre-grief', 'pangs.While', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'favorite', 'gay-themed', 'film', 'spite', 'good', 'brave', 'scenes', 'Fraser', 'boyfriend', 'forget', 'name', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'nice', 'couple', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'highly', 'recommend', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'silly', 'eugenics', 'ideas', 'can', 'get', 'thinking', 'seriously.And', 'may', 'add', 'film', 'was', 'somewhat', 'ahead', 'time', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'rise', 'inherent', 'challenge']",N/A

It's nothing more than a 30-minute melodramatic TV soap opera that's been expanded (painfully) into an hour and a half of inexplicable and often unbearable whining.Fraser's acting is (as always) first-rate.  But the film never bothers to justify its ridiculous premise that conceiving a gay progeny is somehow an earth-shattering tragedy.  It also never explains why or how any of the characters would be justified in supporting the abortion of a pregnancy because the baby *might* turn out to be gay.  So what we're left with is a bunch of incredibly shallow and unlikeable characters with terminally pained expressions debating whether to kill an unborn baby.In certain cultures homosexuality is taboo and not dealt with very well (or at all), and I guess if you're, for example, a Jewish or Italian Catholic family with major phobia issues towards gay people then you might ""get"" this movie.

184956,A71P2O8OMF8GY,1568121520,Rogue Elf,"[3, 5]",Twilight of the Golds is a very well acted story based on the premise that we have the technology to predict not only an unborn baby's sex and eye color but also their tendencies - intelligence; left or right handedness and sexual preference. Brendan Fraser is stellar as the gay brother and future uncle of a sister's Jennifer Beals' unborn potential gay son. Should she have the baby? Should she terminate the pregnancy? Does it make a differncre? Should we know ahead of time what the child should be like? These questions are tackled and the acting is superb. Veteran director/producer Garry Marshall plays the patriach of the movie with a wonderful performance. Faye Dunaway plays his wife in an excellent role for her. Rosie O'Donnell plays a co-worker of Jennifer Beals. A great movie that I reccomend whole heartedly.

Sorry, Ms. Dunaway - you've done brilliant work in your life, but you shouldn't have taken this role - you're not Anne Bancroft, so why try?).  Garry Marshall should also stick to producing and directing and not venture in front of a camera.  Thanks to the talented Brendan Fraser and Jennifer Beals I stayed with it, despite the - at times - heavy-handed writing and the over-the-top acting of Ms. Dunaway and Garry Marshall.The script is a disaster, but at the end of the day, it actually has something very important to say for itself. I have never seen the subject of homophobia dealt with so directly and with such bravado as in this film. It's in your face; you can't escape it...and that's exactly the intent of this film.  It asks uncomfortable questions, and gives uncomfortable answers.  I just wish that Jonathan Tolins and Seth Bass had given their script to a good script doctor. They were definitely going in the right direction, and deserve praise for the effort - just didn't quite capture it on the page.Again, Fraser and Beals are brilliant, and there are additional bon bons: Rosie O'Donnell and Jon Tenney also give memorable performances.Bottom line: an important film that should be seen, although not perfect, but hey, what is?!",4,"Not Perfect, But Important",993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,1482,"['was', 'turn', 'video', 'recorder', '10', 'minutes', 'something', 'kept', 'going', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Feye', 'Dunaway', 'should', 'NEVER', 'EVER', 'again', 'try', 'play', 'Jewish', 'Mama', 'talk', 'unfortunate', 'piece', 'casting', 'Sorry', 'Ms.', 'Dunaway', ""'ve"", 'done', 'brilliant', 'work', 'life', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'role', ""'re"", 'not', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'so', 'why', 'try', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'should', 'also', 'stick', 'producing', 'directing', 'not', 'venture', 'front', 'camera', 'Thanks', 'talented', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'stayed', 'times', 'heavy-handed', 'writing', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'Ms.', 'Dunaway', 'Garry', 'Marshall.The', 'script', 'disaster', 'end', 'day', 'actually', 'something', 'very', 'important', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'subject', 'homophobia', 'dealt', 'so', 'directly', 'such', 'bravado', 'film', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'exactly', 'intent', 'film', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'uncomfortable', 'answers', 'just', 'wish', 'Jonathan', 'Tolins', 'Seth', 'Bass', 'had', 'given', 'script', 'good', 'script', 'doctor', 'were', 'definitely', 'going', 'right', 'direction', 'deserve', 'praise', 'effort', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'page.Again', 'Fraser', 'Beals', 'are', 'brilliant', 'are', 'additional', 'bon', 'bons', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'also', 'give', 'memorable', 'performances.Bottom', 'line', 'important', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'perfect', 'hey', 'what']",N/A
