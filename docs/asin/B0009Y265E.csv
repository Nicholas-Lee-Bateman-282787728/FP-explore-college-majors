First of all, eventhough this concert took place in 1992 in Hamburg, Germany, this new special edition DVD was released in 2005, utilizing High-Definition wide-screen transfer, as well as remastered Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound, with multiple camera editing. Fine. But what about the performance? A masterpiece. The original band members were at their peak, as well as band leader Mick Hucknall. The stage presence and musicianship is just superb. This show performance is much better than the ""Live in London"" DVD, and just as lively and outstanding as the ""Live in Sicily"" DVD. I enjoy live performances and this DVD does it all. It will make your Home Theater system outshine and clearly demostrate that Simply Red crosses all boundaries and feelings with enduring musicianship. As you can tell, it is highly recommended!",5,Finally Released in The U.S. - SIMPLY A MASTERPIECE !,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,937,"['Now', 'have', 'reviewed', 'attended', 'numerous', 'live', 'concerts', 'one', 'consider', 'just', 'masterpiece', 'First', 'concert', 'took', 'place', '1992', 'Hamburg', 'Germany', 'new', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', '2005', 'utilizing', 'High-Definition', 'wide-screen', 'transfer', 'as', 'well', 'remastered', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'DTS', 'surround', 'sound', 'multiple', 'camera', 'editing', 'Fine', 'what', 'performance', 'masterpiece', 'original', 'band', 'members', 'were', 'peak', 'as', 'well', 'band', 'leader', 'Mick', 'Hucknall', 'stage', 'presence', 'musicianship', 'just', 'superb', 'show', 'performance', 'much', 'better', 'Live', 'London', 'DVD', 'just', 'lively', 'outstanding', 'Live', 'Sicily', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'live', 'performances', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'Home', 'Theater', 'system', 'outshine', 'clearly', 'demostrate', 'Simply', 'Red', 'boundaries', 'feelings', 'enduring', 'musicianship', 'can', 'tell', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
