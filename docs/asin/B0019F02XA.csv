I never watched a show on TV until I saw the reruns a couple years ago, well, I was hooked and started watching but they don't play reruns in order, so I was a bit lost. Watching the series in it's entirety, much easier to understand. A must have.

In fact, NCIS is the only prime time show I make a point to watch; most others, I miss because I forget.  But NCIS?  Never.

1163300,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B0019F02XA,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[0, 0]","NCIS is an unusual show. Most shows start with an impact get a core of keen viewers and then go into a decline. NCIS after some years is actually becoming more popular. The positive of the show is the ensemble cast which does a type of routine in each episode whose's charm doesn't seem to wear thin.On first seeing it, the hook of the show seemed to be knee jerk patriotism. (Love of country and love of the military) . After now watching it for five years  I think that was totally of the money.The key to understanding the shows dynamics is to realise that it is all about old blokes. The hero of the show is Gibbs. He is the only person who is not flawed. Gibbs is old playing someone is his 50's although the actor in the role is probably older. Gibbs does not understand computers and can't work a mobile phone. His hobby is wood work. He builds boats in his basement but he does not use power tools. Instead he creates his boats with hand tools. Whilst most old blokes get ridiculed because they are so uncool Gibbs is celebrated. He is not only the smartest investigator the best interrogator but he is the moral centre of the show.So not only is an old bloke the hero but the supporting cast are all flawed to make him appear that much smarter. Tony the next in seniority to Gibbs lacks the gravitas to be a hero. Timothy is just a computer nerd the sort of kid who was no good at sport at school and still defers to those who are the jocks. Duckie the medical examiner is there for comic relief and the women all defer to the elderly hero.One can imagine that the majority of fans are people who can't work all their functions on a mobile phone and who need someone else to set up their computer. Who feel a bit lost in a changing world.Yet despite all this the show works. If it didn't work it would not have gone on for season after season. Even now it does not seem to be tiring although some of the plot devices have become somewhat fantastic.",4,The little show that could,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,1957,"['NCIS', 'unusual', 'show', 'Most', 'shows', 'start', 'impact', 'get', 'core', 'keen', 'viewers', 'then', 'go', 'decline', 'NCIS', 'years', 'actually', 'becoming', 'more', 'popular', 'positive', 'show', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'type', 'routine', 'episode', 'charm', ""n't"", 'seem', 'wear', 'thin.On', 'first', 'seeing', 'hook', 'show', 'seemed', 'be', 'knee', 'jerk', 'patriotism', 'Love', 'country', 'love', 'military', 'now', 'watching', 'five', 'years', 'think', 'was', 'totally', 'money.The', 'key', 'understanding', 'shows', 'dynamics', 'realise', 'old', 'blokes', 'hero', 'show', 'Gibbs', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'flawed', 'Gibbs', 'old', 'playing', 'someone', '50', 'actor', 'role', 'probably', 'older', 'Gibbs', 'not', 'understand', 'computers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'mobile', 'phone', 'hobby', 'wood', 'work', 'boats', 'basement', 'not', 'use', 'power', 'tools', 'Instead', 'boats', 'hand', 'tools', 'Whilst', 'most', 'old', 'blokes', 'get', 'ridiculed', 'are', 'so', 'uncool', 'Gibbs', 'celebrated', 'not', 'only', 'smartest', 'investigator', 'best', 'interrogator', 'moral', 'centre', 'show.So', 'not', 'only', 'old', 'bloke', 'hero', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'flawed', 'make', 'appear', 'much', 'smarter', 'Tony', 'next', 'seniority', 'Gibbs', 'gravitas', 'be', 'hero', 'Timothy', 'just', 'computer', 'sort', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'sport', 'school', 'still', 'defers', 'who', 'are', 'jocks', 'Duckie', 'medical', 'examiner', 'there', 'comic', 'relief', 'women', 'defer', 'elderly', 'hero.One', 'can', 'imagine', 'majority', 'fans', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'functions', 'mobile', 'phone', 'who', 'need', 'someone', 'else', 'set', 'up', 'computer', 'Who', 'feel', 'bit', 'lost', 'changing', 'world.Yet', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'season', 'season', 'Even', 'now', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'tiring', 'plot', 'devices', 'have', 'become', 'somewhat', 'fantastic']",NCIS - Seasons 1-5
