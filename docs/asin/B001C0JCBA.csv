1173594,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B001C0JCBA,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 5]","Cheesy, yet irresistibly funny `Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' has to be one of the best comedies of the year.  Much like `Knocked Up (Unrated Full Screen Edition)' or `Superbad (Rated)' from last year, the film even manages to poke fun at sleaziness and television while providing a sensitive core about relationships that never comes off as tacked on or hypocritical.The movie's first purpose is to set up the characters and make us care about the breakup.  Sarah Marshall (Kristin Bell) is the star of the TV series `Crime Scene:  Scene of the Crime,' (complete with opening film clips with graphic forensic evidence, combined with its redundant title, and we know off the bat we're in for a good time).  Watching `Access Hollywood' from his familiar couch, Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) sees old clips of himself with Sarah on the red carpet and other media encounters as she fielded questions.He does the music for all the scenes in her series.  An on looking director ensures he gets the right mood for every scene.  Life is good for Peter Bretter.  Until the day Sarah comes over to break off their five-year relationship.  She finds him naked and asks him to put some clothes on, but he refuses, thinking it will prevent her from giving him the ax.  In a short time, we're snickering and commiserating over Peter's loss at the same time.Pete tries multiple relationships and sorts out advice from his brother Brian (Bill Hadett) and his wife, Liz (Liz Cackowski), but what he does makes all the difference.Remembering that Sarah always wanted to go to Hawaii as a paradise getaway, he decides to leave her memory behind.  And this is when it gets contrived, but its so well done, we forgive and forget the plot devices:  She has gone to Hawaii, too, not just to the same island, but to the same hotel.  She arrives with her new British boyfriend, Aldous Snow, a singing sensation.  As you might expect, Peter has trouble fulfilling the main purpose of his journey, but gets easily distracted and absorbed in some informal detective work.  When he has to move out of his bargain suite, he finds himself next door to the new rival couple.At the hotel Pete finds diversion.  There's solace in cocktails, food, and exercise classes.  Colorful, laid back people make his journey better.  There's Chuck (Paul Rudd) the surfing instructor, Matthew, the waiter (Jonah Hill `Superbad' star) who begs Greg to listen to his demo C.D., and Kemo (Taylor Wily), a native islander who keeps him socially active.  But the real connection is made with the hotel's hospitality hostess, Rachel Jensen (a sweet and beautiful Mila Kunis) who gave him a slash discount on a penthouse suite in the first place.`Forgetting Sarah Marshall' has to have some of the best comic timing provided all year.  Superbly edited, flashback scenes of their relationship make us laugh while the finer points of their downfall are brought to consciousness.  As a successful music man, Peter understandably yearns for something bigger.  How they fit in his composition of `Dracula:  The Rock Opera,' a stage musical, is masterful.  Despite his melodramatic intentions, his show comes off as a puppet `The Phantom of the Opera' version of 'Dracula' if Meat Loaf penned the project.  Rachel can at least appreciate his original for what it is.  There's no doubt if Segel didn't play his drowning with sorrow everyman so empathetically, this movie wouldn't play out nearly as well.  (He wrote the script, so he knows his part.)  What in places sounds like your average TV sitcom is done with comic aces.  `Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is funny, sweet, and sure-footed.  And that makes a world of difference.A J.P.'s Pick:  4*'s = Very Good(I'd like to call this the comedy of the year, but, while I've seen several, I've yet to see `Tropic Thunder,' `Pineapple Express,' and `Burn After Reading'.  So, I don't want to be premature here.)",4,"""Unforgettable""",1222905600,"10 2, 2008",2008,3895,"['Cheesy', 'yet', 'irresistibly', 'funny', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'year', 'Much', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Unrated', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'Superbad', 'Rated', 'last', 'year', 'film', 'even', 'poke', 'fun', 'sleaziness', 'television', 'providing', 'sensitive', 'core', 'relationships', 'never', 'off', 'tacked', 'hypocritical.The', 'movie', 'first', 'purpose', 'set', 'up', 'characters', 'make', 'care', 'breakup', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Kristin', 'Bell', 'star', 'TV', 'series', 'Crime', 'Scene', 'Scene', 'Crime', 'complete', 'opening', 'film', 'clips', 'graphic', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'combined', 'redundant', 'title', 'know', 'bat', ""'re"", 'good', 'time', 'Watching', 'Access', 'Hollywood', 'familiar', 'couch', 'Peter', 'Bretter', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'old', 'clips', 'Sarah', 'red', 'carpet', 'other', 'media', 'encounters', 'fielded', 'questions.He', 'music', 'scenes', 'series', 'looking', 'director', 'right', 'mood', 'scene', 'Life', 'good', 'Peter', 'Bretter', 'day', 'Sarah', 'break', 'off', 'five-year', 'relationship', 'naked', 'put', 'clothes', 'thinking', 'will', 'prevent', 'giving', 'ax', 'short', 'time', ""'re"", 'snickering', 'commiserating', 'over', 'Peter', 'loss', 'same', 'time.Pete', 'tries', 'multiple', 'relationships', 'sorts', 'out', 'advice', 'brother', 'Brian', 'Bill', 'Hadett', 'wife', 'Liz', 'Liz', 'Cackowski', 'what', 'difference.Remembering', 'Sarah', 'always', 'wanted', 'go', 'Hawaii', 'paradise', 'getaway', 'leave', 'memory', 'when', 'contrived', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'forgive', 'forget', 'plot', 'devices', 'gone', 'Hawaii', 'too', 'not', 'just', 'same', 'island', 'same', 'hotel', 'new', 'British', 'boyfriend', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'singing', 'sensation', 'might', 'expect', 'Peter', 'trouble', 'fulfilling', 'main', 'purpose', 'journey', 'easily', 'distracted', 'absorbed', 'informal', 'detective', 'work', 'When', 'move', 'bargain', 'suite', 'next', 'door', 'new', 'rival', 'couple.At', 'hotel', 'Pete', 'diversion', 'solace', 'cocktails', 'food', 'exercise', 'classes', 'Colorful', 'laid', 'back', 'people', 'make', 'journey', 'better', 'Chuck', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'surfing', 'instructor', 'Matthew', 'waiter', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Superbad', 'star', 'who', 'Greg', 'listen', 'demo', 'C.D.', 'Kemo', 'Taylor', 'Wily', 'native', 'islander', 'who', 'socially', 'active', 'real', 'connection', 'made', 'hotel', 'hospitality', 'hostess', 'Rachel', 'Jensen', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'who', 'gave', 'slash', 'discount', 'penthouse', 'suite', 'first', 'place.', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'have', 'best', 'comic', 'timing', 'provided', 'year', 'Superbly', 'edited', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'relationship', 'make', 'finer', 'points', 'downfall', 'are', 'brought', 'consciousness', 'successful', 'music', 'man', 'Peter', 'understandably', 'something', 'bigger', 'How', 'fit', 'composition', 'Dracula', 'Rock', 'Opera', 'stage', 'musical', 'masterful', 'melodramatic', 'intentions', 'show', 'off', 'puppet', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'version', ""'Dracula"", 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'penned', 'project', 'Rachel', 'can', 'least', 'appreciate', 'original', 'what', 'doubt', 'Segel', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'drowning', 'sorrow', 'everyman', 'so', 'empathetically', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'wrote', 'script', 'part', 'What', 'places', 'sounds', 'average', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'done', 'comic', 'aces', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'funny', 'sweet', 'sure-footed', 'world', 'difference.A', 'J.P.', 'Pick', '4*', '=', 'Very', 'Good', ""'d"", 'like', 'call', 'comedy', 'year', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'Burn', 'Reading', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'premature', 'here']",N/A

1173599,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B001C0JCBA,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[0, 0]","The story runs around a male character who gets his heart broken over an actress. Later you learn that he loves her dearly and is true but he starts to slack a bit I guess (in the relationship).Then she breaks up with him. He aches over it time and time again, after trying to unsuccessfully win her back. She takes off to Hawaii for a vacation or something I guess and he consults his step brother about the break up a few times before deciding on following her because she gave him the idea that there was a nice place in Hawaii.So a bit occurs, and then he's in Hawaii. They see each other. There are a few awkward scenes but then he runs into the most simply beautiful (and underrated if I must say) Mila Kunis, who plays Rachel, a nearly care-free spirit that is oh-so inviting to be around.For a while he weeps over his ex but he slowly drifts toward Rachel, the front desk girl. They eventually have good things going on and they hit it off.Without giving too much more away I will say this movie is an extremely solid watch. It's funny way more often than it's not and there was only one slight disappointment in it which overall just made the experience that more down to earth and real.Mila is by far my favorite character because in real life she'd just be so damn easy to be around. The main character (Jason Segel) is the next best character displaying a lot of emotions that many guys lack on screen. He's great throughout and only relate-able.Just a head's up though - there are a few bits of male nudity (penis and all).All in all, highly recommended.4.2 stars.",4,"Plain and simple, yet another good movie.

1173603,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B001C0JCBA,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[14, 19]","FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is Spring, 2008's offering from the Judd Apatow stable.  The humor and interesting characters are there, but IMHO this film goes further and deeper than his previous hits.  Jason Segel, in what is probably his first starring role, plays Peter Barret, a New York-based movie-music composer stuck in a rut until the title character (crisply played by Kristen Bell) uncermoniously dumps him in favor of ""Aldous Snow,"" a pompous rocker from England (Russell Brand).Seeking to get away from his pain and get a fresh start, Peter flies to Hawaii where he keeps accidentally-on-purpose running into his former sweetie and her new beau.  The suffering is nearly endless for Peter; and despite everyone's urging he insists on staying at the same resort hotel as the new love pair, redoubling his misery.  (He's a good comic weeper.)New romance opens up in the character of Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis), a helpful and surprisingly sharp-witted hotel clerk who finds herself slowly attracted to Peter.  The comic complications that ensue are best left unspoiled, but it's fair to say that everyone in the main cast gets a little more experienced, if not necessarily a little wiser, by movie's end. (Okay, this is a type of screwball comedy and the male lead is Segal's character, but whom will he wind up with, if anyone?)  Rachel becomes more complicated as the film progresses, and it's a testament to Mila Kunis' pinpoint acting talent that we realize that so well.The hijinks in this film are at least as vital and shocking as in movies like KNOCKED UP and SUPERBAD; in fact, the script does those films two better by showing brief frontal nudity -- male and female.  And the supporting cast holds its own, especially Jack McBrayer of NBC's ""30 Rock"" as an ignorant honeymooner and a nearly unrecognizable Paul Rudd as a honey-haired, gooey-brained fortyish surfer dude who tries to teach ""the Zen of surfing"" without any ability to communicate same.But what really distinguishes FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is not the pratfalls but the character development.  Apatow's most recent and celebrated movies have dealt with characters who are seniors in high school or freshmen in the School of Life; FORGETTING shows that adults of any age (in this case, mostly thirtyish) can be just as goofy, frustrating and endearing when trying to make sense of a life made chaotic by the shifting currents of love and sex.I can recommend FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL wholeheartedly except for parents who don't want their kids to see Peter's junk or a junky topless Polaroid shot of Rachel.  The ""R"" rating also applies to language and unlike so many modern comedies (WHIPPED comes to mind), the f-word is used to describe an act, not made a universal complaint or insult by adding -ing.Apatow has quite a good repertory cast shaping up, many of whom are on display here; and Jason Segal has taken his place among the first rank of adult comic-romance leads.  I look foward to seeing where Apatow will head from here cinematically.  BTW trivia note:  Mila Kunis is the voice of Meg on Fox TV's ""Family Guy.""",4,Goes beyond KNOCKED UP and SUPERBAD,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,3105,"['FORGETTING', 'SARAH', 'MARSHALL', 'Spring', '2008', 'offering', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'stable', 'humor', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'IMHO', 'film', 'further', 'deeper', 'previous', 'hits', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'what', 'probably', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'Peter', 'Barret', 'New', 'York-based', 'movie-music', 'composer', 'stuck', 'rut', 'title', 'character', 'crisply', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'uncermoniously', 'favor', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'pompous', 'rocker', 'England', 'Russell', 'Brand', '.Seeking', 'get', 'away', 'pain', 'get', 'fresh', 'start', 'Peter', 'Hawaii', 'where', 'accidentally-on-purpose', 'running', 'former', 'sweetie', 'new', 'beau', 'suffering', 'nearly', 'endless', 'Peter', 'everyone', 'urging', 'staying', 'same', 'resort', 'hotel', 'new', 'love', 'pair', 'redoubling', 'misery', 'good', 'comic', 'weeper', 'New', 'romance', 'up', 'character', 'Rachel', 'Jansen', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'helpful', 'surprisingly', 'sharp-witted', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'who', 'slowly', 'attracted', 'Peter', 'comic', 'complications', 'ensue', 'are', 'best', 'left', 'unspoiled', 'fair', 'say', 'everyone', 'main', 'cast', 'little', 'more', 'experienced', 'not', 'necessarily', 'little', 'wiser', 'movie', 'end', 'Okay', 'type', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'male', 'lead', 'Segal', 'character', 'whom', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'anyone', 'Rachel', 'more', 'complicated', 'film', 'testament', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'pinpoint', 'acting', 'talent', 'realize', 'so', 'well.The', 'hijinks', 'film', 'are', 'least', 'vital', 'shocking', 'movies', 'KNOCKED', 'UP', 'SUPERBAD', 'fact', 'script', 'films', 'two', 'better', 'showing', 'brief', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'supporting', 'cast', 'own', 'especially', 'Jack', 'McBrayer', 'NBC', '30', 'Rock', 'ignorant', 'honeymooner', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'honey-haired', 'gooey-brained', 'fortyish', 'surfer', 'dude', 'who', 'teach', 'Zen', 'surfing', 'ability', 'communicate', 'same.But', 'what', 'really', 'FORGETTING', 'SARAH', 'MARSHALL', 'not', 'pratfalls', 'character', 'development', 'Apatow', 'most', 'recent', 'celebrated', 'movies', 'have', 'dealt', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'seniors', 'high', 'school', 'freshmen', 'School', 'Life', 'FORGETTING', 'adults', 'age', 'case', 'mostly', 'thirtyish', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'goofy', 'frustrating', 'endearing', 'when', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'life', 'made', 'chaotic', 'shifting', 'currents', 'love', 'sex.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'FORGETTING', 'SARAH', 'MARSHALL', 'wholeheartedly', 'parents', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'kids', 'see', 'Peter', 'junk', 'junky', 'topless', 'Polaroid', 'shot', 'Rachel', 'R', 'rating', 'also', 'language', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'comedies', 'WHIPPED', 'mind', 'f-word', 'used', 'describe', 'act', 'not', 'made', 'universal', 'complaint', 'insult', 'adding', '-ing.Apatow', 'quite', 'good', 'repertory', 'cast', 'shaping', 'up', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'display', 'here', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'taken', 'place', 'first', 'rank', 'adult', 'comic-romance', 'look', 'foward', 'seeing', 'where', 'Apatow', 'will', 'head', 'here', 'cinematically', 'BTW', 'trivia', 'note', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'voice', 'Meg', 'Fox', 'TV', 'Family', 'Guy']",N/A

The man is hilarious, and even more than that, he understands depth to comedy and allows for his work to really shine with emotional complexities.  `Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is his first screenplay, and it really cements him as a new voice in the world of comedy.  Yes, I'm ashamed that I have just seen this for the first time this past weekend, but better late than never.While `Forgetting Sarah Marshall' can't escape the clich&eacute;s that burden these romantic comedies entirely, it sidesteps being pigeonholed thanks to some strategically placed comedic highlights that cut through those predictabilities with a freshness that makes this film feel new and exciting.  That was the biggest delight I felt while watching this film.  It all felt so original despite not really being all that original.  Segel's comedic take on the subject made this wholly enjoyable.The performances are rich and spot on, the dialog is sharp and witty, the scenario is the perfect canvas for some nicely unexpected sequences of bliss and the musical numbers (LOL at Dracula's Lament) are divine.This may be a the perfect `adult' comedy.  None of the crude humor feels overwhelming because, unlike Adam Sandler, Jason Segel understands the importance of knowing your boundaries and shading your humor so as to show a nice balance.

But then, I heard an extended interview with Jason Segel, and my feelings changed.  My husband and I finally got around to renting the movie last night, and it was even better than I had anticipated!  Segel leads a talented cast which includes Mila Kunis (in a much different role here than the recent Black Swan), Kristen Bell, Russell Brand (who will play the lead in the upcoming Arthur remake), and Paul Rudd (almost unrecognizable!).Not only was the movie funny, but also it included plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.  The plot was somewhat predictable--e.g., as soon as Kunis's Rachel is introduced, it's not too hard to guess who the new love interest for Segel's Peter is going to be--but there are also some unexpectedly hilarious segues (Dracula, opera, puppets; need I say more?).  Even the extra deleted scenes included on the DVD were entertaining, and my husband and I agreed that one of them, which provided some closure between Peter and Sarah, should have been included in the theatrical movie release.Overall, this I thought that Forgetting Sarah Marshall had a very similar feel to the movie Couples Retreat, so I think that fans of Couples Retreat will enjoy this as well (and be sure to watch the credits, because there is a cameo from one of the stars of Couples Retreat!).

1173619,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B001C0JCBA,Bill Garrison,"[2, 3]","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is the latest in a growing category of Judd Apatow-inspired raunchy comedy genre. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is written by and stars Jason Segal. Segal is an actor I wasn't familiar with but has been on television in the show ""How I Met Your Mother.""In this film, Segal plays Peter, a composer for a hit CSI type show that stars his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Marshall breaks off their relationship and Peter is devestated. After trying his luck dating other women, Peter's brother Brian (a great character played by Bill Hader) convinces Peter to take a vacation. Peter goes to Hawaii, a favorite place of Sarah's, and when he arrives, finds Sarah vacationing with her new boyfriend, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand).Hilarity ensues as Sarah and her boyfriend Aldous, a womanizing British rock star, live out their new relationship over heart broken Peter. Peter does find a ray of hope in the attractive hotel clerk Rachel (Milo Kunis). Peter slowly begins to develop a relatioship with Rachel while fighting the lingering feelings for Sarah.The new trend the Apatow comedies is to shock the audience with its language and adult comedy. This movie tries that too, but if you pull away the gimmick, you still have to have a story, and this movie does. Peter is truly heartbroken at losing his girlfriend. Sarah is confused about whether or not she still loves Peter. Rachel is a sincere, normal girl.There is a lot to like about this movie. I loved the cast. Segal, Bell and Kunis have all been on television but I'd never watched them, so they were new and fresh to me. Apatow regulars Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill also have strong supporting rolls. Russell Brand is great as the weird British rockstar. The red-headed newlyweds are great. So is Peter's Dracula opera. And the clips of Sarah Marshall's CSI type show are pretty funny too.This movie is a lot of fun. The strong story made the comedy that much better. Still, a warning for those concerned. There is nudity, swearing, and sex so it is not a movie for children. This is a comedy for adults as opposed to one like Superbad which I thought was more for college kids.",4,A great movie in the raunchy comedy genre!,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,2161,"['Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'latest', 'growing', 'category', 'Judd', 'Apatow-inspired', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'genre', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'written', 'stars', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'Segal', 'actor', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'been', 'television', 'show', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'film', 'Segal', 'Peter', 'composer', 'hit', 'CSI', 'type', 'show', 'girlfriend', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Marshall', 'off', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'devestated', 'trying', 'luck', 'dating', 'other', 'women', 'Peter', 'brother', 'Brian', 'great', 'character', 'played', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'convinces', 'Peter', 'take', 'vacation', 'Peter', 'Hawaii', 'favorite', 'place', 'Sarah', 'when', 'Sarah', 'vacationing', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'Russell', 'Brand', '.Hilarity', 'ensues', 'Sarah', 'boyfriend', 'Aldous', 'womanizing', 'British', 'rock', 'star', 'live', 'out', 'new', 'relationship', 'heart', 'broken', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'find', 'ray', 'hope', 'attractive', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'Rachel', 'Milo', 'Kunis', 'Peter', 'slowly', 'develop', 'relatioship', 'Rachel', 'fighting', 'lingering', 'feelings', 'Sarah.The', 'new', 'trend', 'Apatow', 'comedies', 'shock', 'audience', 'language', 'adult', 'comedy', 'movie', 'too', 'pull', 'away', 'gimmick', 'still', 'have', 'have', 'story', 'movie', 'Peter', 'truly', 'heartbroken', 'losing', 'girlfriend', 'Sarah', 'confused', 'not', 'still', 'Peter', 'Rachel', 'sincere', 'normal', 'girl.There', 'lot', 'like', 'movie', 'loved', 'cast', 'Segal', 'Bell', 'Kunis', 'have', 'been', 'television', ""'d"", 'never', 'watched', 'were', 'new', 'fresh', 'Apatow', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'also', 'have', 'strong', 'supporting', 'rolls', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'great', 'weird', 'British', 'rockstar', 'red-headed', 'newlyweds', 'are', 'great', 'So', 'Peter', 'Dracula', 'opera', 'clips', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'CSI', 'type', 'show', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'too.This', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'strong', 'story', 'made', 'comedy', 'much', 'better', 'Still', 'warning', 'concerned', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'sex', 'not', 'movie', 'children', 'comedy', 'adults', 'opposed', 'one', 'Superbad', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'college', 'kids']",N/A

Martin,"[1, 2]","Jason Segel proves that he is the latest Judd Apatow protege to deliver the comic goods in this raunchy, sweet and totally entertaining comedy about healing broken hearts.Segel wrote and stars as an underacheiving every man who, after getting dumped by his celebrity girlriend (Kristen Bell) takes a vacation to Hawaii to put her behind him.  The buds of a new romance develop quickly when he meets Rachel (Mila Kunis) who works the front desk at the resort he stays at.  But as fate would have it, Sarah and her new boyfriend (Russell Brand) are staying there as well.In lesser hands, this could have devolved into pure Hollywood cliche:  Segel's character spends the entire movie trying to win Sarah back all the while oblivious to the fact that Rachel is the right woman for him.  Thankfully, this movie is a great deal smarter and more emotionally complex than that.  Peter and Rachel begin, albeit hesitantly, a relationship but Sarah eventually realizes she still cares for her ex and attempts to win him back.  Peter's dilemma of whether or not to pursue his relationship with Rachel or fall back into his old one with Sarah feels real and messy, with serious consequences.But let's not get too serious here...this is a comedy after all.  The supporting cast is terrific including Paul Rudd in another hilarious turn, the fat guy from Superbad who makes the most out of his limited screen time, and most notably Russell Brand as Sarah's new boyfriend.  Brand manages to raise the comic energy of every scene he's in.The movie ultimately works it's way towards a satisfying ending, but getting there is great fun.  The jokes never feel rushed or out of characther.  Segel's writing allows for the comedy to flow from the characters' personalities which can lead to some enormous belly laughs.  There is also a ton of raunchy humor here as well, but it's evened out by the underlying tenderness that flows throughout the film.The only question that lingers after the movie ends......who will be the next Apatow player to wow us with a comedy gem?

Forgetting Sarah Marshall is the first movie I can remember where the supporting cast is just as funny as the main. With a cast as strong as Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, and Russel Brand, that's saying something.From beginning to end there is no slow point in this movie. No parts that drag along. Nothing. Jason Segel has successfully written an absolutely brilliant comedy that is filled to the brim with heart at the exact same time. That's what I love about Jason. He is hilarious, yet, he has the skill as an actor to portray even the toughest emotions believeably. My first time viewing this I really didn't think he was very funny but with further viewings it becomes very apparent that his character is more nuanced. It's the little things he does and says that make you realize how funny he is.As I already stated, the supporting cast is something to behold. Paul Rudd as the stoner surf instructor, Bill Hader as the brother, Jonah Hill as the Russel Brand-obsessed waiter, and even Kristen Wiig and Jason Bateman in surprise cameos all play wonderfully into the overall story.Where most comedies leave the comedy to the guys, Forgetting Sarah Marshall lets the girls get into the mix as well. Knowing that, they couldn't have casted a better pair of ladies. Kristen Bell is hilarious in her CSI-spoofing cop drama and even has some great one-liners, and Mila Kunis, as we all know from her time on That 70s Show, has impeccable comedic timing. Giving her an R-rated setting to let her cuss her heart out just adds to the comedy in some scenes.All in all, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is one of the funniest movies in recent memory, and a movie that really launched Jason Segel into the limelight. Whether it's Jason dealing with a break-up or the emotional conflict of whether or not he really does want Sarah Marshall back, this movie is both touching and laugh out loud funny through the entire runtime.

The film you most definitely want to see is the delightful '08 release 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'.  Jason Segel is perfect in the role of poor, broken hearted Peter Bretter who has just been dumped by love interest and popular television actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). In an attempt to flee from his pain he jumps on a plane and flies to Hawaii only to discover his ex and her new boyfriend are also there and staying in the same hotel.Will Peter win back the love and affection of Sarah or will he find what he is looking for in another? Maybe with the attentive and attractive girl (Mila Kunis) managing the front desk at the hotel?This film has it all; attractive, solid cast, superior story line with lots of hilarious, quirky moments and memorable dialogue you're sure to quote again and again.

Throw in the bit parts from SNL's Bill Hader and Kirsten Wiig, 30 Rock's page Jack McBrayer, a Baldwin (William!) and a Barney Miller sighting in Steve Landesburg and we got an A&W; level ""2 for 4 Mama burgers"" party.Of the bit parts Paul Rudd stands out as a surfer dude without channeling a Spicoli. Thankfully, Apatow shoved the weakest link in Jonah Hill into a bit part in this movie because I'm sorry, the guy is should not be a leading actor as he is in other Apatow flicks.Of the leads Mila Kunis is beyond perfect in the way she is the counterfoil to Kristen Bell. I would be remiss leaving out the man who brings new meaning to vampire puppet operas, Joel Segal.The extras make it definitely worth picking up the DVDs. You get the usual director's/actors' commentary track, a gag reel, deleted scenes (some of which are gut-bustingly funny) as well as a line-o-rama that features the best lines from the movie.

Everyone else: this is a hilarious movie about a love triangle or square, possibly. Apatow and friends have a knack for taking very specific moments from most people's lives and turning them into a funny movie with a lot of heart i.e. teenage angst/ going to college in Superbad, losing one's virginity in 40-year old Virgin, becoming a new parent in Knocked up, and getting broken up with in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

1173629,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B001C0JCBA,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","There seems to be a little comedy club, like a secret fraternity, and one wonders just what is the secret handshake to get in? It helps, rather than hinders, if you've been in TV, especially Freaks and Geeks, which was Forgetting Sarah Marshall Producer Judd Apatow's pet project. Judd Apatow is a name you might want to casually drop into a conversation over lunch at Wolfgang Puck's. Jason Segel cut his teeth on Freaks and Geeks, and he wrote FSM, and stars in it as the heart broken Peter Bretter. Some of the break up experiences were true, and some were exaggerated. He did in fact, try to get over a break up by writing a Rock Opera about Dracula:-----------------------Rachel Jansen: [about his rock opera] Why Dracula?Peter Bretter: Because he's just a man, he wants to be loved but every woman he gets near he ends up smothering and killing, and I've had similar experiences.====================Wonder if he got any advice about writing Show Tunes from Neil Patrick Harris, who is after all, an authority on the subject (check out Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along-Blog. Not only that, but he hosted the Tony Awards). Segel and Harris are both currently on ""How I Met Your Mother,"" and it would seem an excellent opportunity for Segel to get help finishing his Musical-within-a-movie while they waited around between set-ups.Who else in FSM has worked more on the small screen than the silver one? Let's see.There's Kristen Bell, who plays Sarah Marshall, the woman he's trying to forget. Kristen Bell was Veronica Mars on ""Veronica Mars"" (64 episodes, 2004-2007).Mila Kunis is Rachel Jansen, the woman he's trying to forget Sarah with. Mila was Jackie Burkhart on ""That '70s Show"" (201 episodes, 1998-2006). Jackie was such an annoying brat that it is quite a surprise to see her in FSM. Even Russell Brand, who plays Sarah's new boyfriend, the polymorphously perverse and annoyingly full-of-himself rock star Aldous Snow, lead singer of Infant Sorrow (BTW, Brand is engaged to Katy Perry in so-called Real Life); confessed that he fancied her.Bill Hader is from ""Saturday Night Live,"" Jack McBrayer is on ""30 Rock,"" and Paul Rudd was Mike Hannigan, one of Phoebe's many boyfriends, on ""Friends"" (18 episodes, 2002-2004). He also made an appearance on Kristen Bell's ""Veronica Mars."" Paul Rudd was Desmond Fellows (1 episode, 2007).The plethora of TV actors was also appropriate because one of the main things that made Peter want to forget Sarah Marshall was that she was the star of a CSI-like cop show, while he was the show's composer. It was less than fulfilling work, though. He was reduced to producing ominous sounding fills, mostly percussion. There were some great clips that parodied those kind of shows, with William Baldwin skewering Horatio Kane and his ilk as Detective Hunter Rush:-----------------------Sarah Marshall: [lifts up the sheet] What do you think, Rush?Detective Hunter Rush: [cringes] It's going to be hard for her to reenter the pageant... without a face.====================He has the dramatic, Shatneresque pause, punctuated by taking off his sun glasses. Those shows are already a self-parody, so they're not as easy to make fun of as you would think. Meanwhile, what was it exactly that caused Sarah to dump Peter?-----------------------Sarah Marshall: It got really hard taking care of you when you stopped taking care of yourself, I tried everything to get you off your little island, the couch.====================Wonder if Peter Bretten watched much TV while he was on his little island, the couch? Seems like Sarah Marshall was having as much trouble getting Peter off the island as the Skipper and Gilligan were, not to mention the Professor and Mary Ann. Three hour tour? Anyway, I'm not complaining about all the TV talent in FSM, because with all that comedy experience you have a crack ensemble ready, willing, and able to kick it up a notch. Before there was Robin Williams there was a little show called ""Mork & Mindy,"" and Jim Carrey paid his dues with ""Duck Factory"" and ""In Living Color.""-----------------------Peter Bretter: I love Hawaii.Sarah Marshall: Yeah, it's nice, but I think for like a week, tops. Any more than that and I know that I'd go crazy, because I think that Hawaii is a place to escape for people who can't deal with the real world.Rachel Jansen: Yeah, you know, there's so few personal shoppers and pet therapists. Gosh, it's such a hard life.====================A cool thing about FSM was the setting in Oahu, an island of Hawaii. It seemed like a great place to regroup and fix a broken heart. Even if Peter spent the first part of his vacation drinking potent cocktails with little umbrellas, he did eventually come to realize that he could be happy without booze and Sarah Marshall. Don't want to give away too much, but besides the cute and helpful desk clerk, Rachel, there was Surf Instructor Chuck (a rudderless Paul Rudd), and helpful staff like Kimo (Taylor Wily) ready to offer understanding and a little Kimo-therapy:-----------------------Kimo: Are those sad tissues or happy tissues?====================FSM was a very funny movie, and it was enhanced by the setting. I love Hawaii--Oahu, Maui. Mahalo!FSM was kind of a mish mash, but it comes at you like one of those gigantic waves all the surfers are always raving about. Shall I compare it to a Shakespearean comedy of errors? Another thing about FSM, it had sincerity.My niece Lulu thinks it was just about the funniest movie ever, but I think that Superbad is. I thought that FSM had kind of a shaky start, but it picked up comedy momentum. Superbad rushes out of the gate and doesn't look back. But that's just me. Your mileage may vary.The Bottom Line is that Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a memorable and funny film, and Jason Segel would seem to have a future beyond TV--both writing screenplays and acting in films. He is not such a bad songwriter/lyricist, either. He wrote some cool tunes for the film, both the Dracula musical and some tunes for Aldous Snow. Of the songs that he did not write for the film, I liked that there were two versions of The Artist Formerly Known as Prince's Nothing Compares 2 U, by both Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor and The Coconutz with Daniel Ho. The second one captured the 'flava' of the islands, like that uke version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Who does that? It's awesome.-----------------------Darald: Let me just say that if God was a city planner he would not put a playground next to a sewage system!====================I Love You, Man(2009) Jason Segel was Sydney Fife; Paul Rudd was Peter KlavenMax Payne(2008) Mila Kunis was Mona SaxSuperbad (Unrated Widescreen Edition)(2007) Jonah Hill was Seth; Bill Hader was Officer SlaterKnocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)(2007) Jason Segel was Jason; Bill Hader was Brent; Jonah Hill was Jonah; Paul Rudd was PeteWalk Hard - The Dewey Cox Story (Two-Disc Special Edition)(2007) Jack McBrayer was DJ; (uncredited) Jonah Hill was Older Nate; (uncredited) Paul Rudd was John LennonThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated Widescreen Edition)(2005) Jonah Hill was eBay Customer; Paul Rudd was DavidPootie Tang(2001) Kristen Bell was Record Executive's DaughterCan't Hardly Wait(1998) Jason Segel was Watermelon GuyThe Size Of Watermelons(1996) Paul Rudd was AlexSliver (Unrated Edition)(1993) William Baldwin was Zeke Hawkins-----------------------Darald: What's the state fish of Hawaii?Dwayne the Bartender: The Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.====================",4,What's the state fish of Hawaii?

1173631,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001C0JCBA,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a film that easily could have been a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy but instead aims for something better. It doesn't have much to do with Jason Segel's much talked about nude scene (but it's pathetic nature gives it an oddly effective touch); while the sense of humor is at times a bit over the top, and while many of the side characters remain undeveloped, its heart is basically in the right place the entire time. This is an interesting twist because the story begins with Segel's character suffering from a broken heart and ends with the pieces struggling to fit back into place. I can't say that I understand everything he's feeling, since love is a game I play so infrequently--what I can say is that, even though I didn't understand him, I still rooted for him from beginning to end. He has a vulnerable charm, like a wounded animal you're inclined to nurse back to health.The story begins with TV star Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) breaking up with her long time boyfriend, composer Peter Bretter (Segel). He takes rejection as badly as you'd expect him to; for days on end, he cries at the drop of a hat, tormented by the endless reminders of her scattered all over his house. He tries to alleviate his pain with a slew of one-night stands, all of which go nowhere. At a certain point, Peter's stepbrother, Brian (Bill Hader), convinces him that he needs to take a vacation, and where better to go than Hawaii? Peter reluctantly agrees. But as soon as he arrives, his peace of mind is immediately disturbed: Sarah is also vacationing in Hawaii, and she's staying in the same hotel. Worse yet, she's there with her new boyfriend, the English rock singer Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). To cut him some slack, the hotel clerk, Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis), offers to let Peter stay in the hotel's most expensive suite. Of course, he'll have to clean up after himself since he's not an official guest.A friendship soon develops, one we know will lead to something more serious. Initially, Peter is more interested in brooding over his failed relationship--he drinks cocktails everyday, and he continues to cry at the drop of a hat. It doesn't help that he and Sarah constantly bump into each other, and it's always awkward because Aldous is much more inclined to be social. One wonders what she sees in Aldous, anyway; he may look like a model, but he also thinks and behaves like the selfish pop icon he is, flaunting his sexual prowess openly and often.Peter and Rachel, meanwhile, grow closer together. We eventually learn that Rachel followed her ex-boyfriend to Hawaii, leaving friends, family, and school behind her. We also learn that Peter has been writing a musical based on Dracula; if actually performed, it would feature puppets instead of actors. We get a taste of his work at a local dive, where he plays a piece on a dare from Rachel. As he sings in a Transylvanian accent, we're torn; his performance is overwrought and silly, yet he's obviously giving it his all. If he were a real person, we wouldn't know whether to let him down easy or to encourage him further. Rachel seems just as torn, since she knows a thing or two about ambition and broken dreams. Her love life has been just as disastrous as Peter's, maybe even more so: Should she pursue a relationship with him knowing she might end up hurting all over again? Should Peter do the same?There's a point at which all four main characters find themselves on a double date, one that's simultaneously funny and thick with tension. Peter, Sarah, and Rachel down glass after glass of wine, so by the end of the night, their tongues are dangerously loose. Aldous maintains his sobriety while not doing a thing about his arrogance; this puts Sarah at odds with him as well as with Rachel, who's rapidly losing her prim image as a hotel employee. Their pent up emotions burst out after dinner, when both couples go back to their rooms and compete for having the loudest sex. What makes this scene funnier is that, at this point in the story, Peter has been moved to a room directly next to Sarah's. Is this plot point clever or contrived? You'd think it would fall under the latter category, but it's difficult to say since the scene works so well.What doesn't work so well are the series of side characters that add little to the main story. Peter occasionally speaks to a newlywed husband named Darald (Jack McBrayer) who's terrified of having sex with his eager wife, Wyoma (Maria Thayer). Peter also socializes with a bartender (Da'Vone McDonald) and a luau waiter (Kalani Robb), both of whom exist purely as an excuse for funny dialogue. Paul Rudd has a very small part as a surf instructor named Chuck, a man whose brain is just as sun-baked as his skin. All of these characters work in and of themselves, but they don't really contribute anything significant, other than more comedy. It seems to me that the basic story between Peter, Rachel, Sarah, and Aldous is funny enough. But I'm really just nitpicking--there's more than enough here to keep an audience entertained. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is, quite simply, a fun film. It's also touching at times, which is good since most romantic comedies drown themselves in a flood of jokiness and predictable patterns. This movie is funny, but it's also substantive, a combination you don't see too often anymore.",4,The Hard Goodbye,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,5372,"['Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'film',

The story is one most people can relate to - a guy gets dumped, tries to forget his ex but can't get away from her, and manages to find someone else. The part where I almost gave up on it was around where Jason Segel's character was breaking down in scenes which were intended to be funny, but at times just felt sad. I enjoy comedies which include their share of drama, but these scenes felt too forced. It seemed like some of those scenes stretched on for too long or borderline-funny gags were repeated too much. The movie does still have its share of funny scenes, like most of Apatow's films.The scenes with the Dracula puppet musical were quite funny and the ending was rather touching. I will also give the movie credit for being one of the few daring enough to include male frontal nudity.

Also, starring in the film is popular British comedian Russell Brand (""Bedtime Stories""), Jonah Hill (""Strange Wilderness"", ""Superbad"", ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"") and Paul Rudd (""I Love You, Man"", ""Knocked Up"" and ""Night at the Museum"").""""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is about television composer Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) who is dating TV starlet Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) who is on the TV crime drama series ""Crime Scene"".  Sarah comes home much earlier than expected and Peter who is expecting a surprise, ends up being dumped by Sarah.Not taking it well, Peter tries to get over Sarah as best as he can to no avail.  His brother Brian (Bill Hader) and his wife Liz (Liz Cackowski) try their best to help Peter by suggesting that he date other women.  But no matter how many women he dates and sleeps with, Sarah stays in his mind.  His home is a constant reminder of Sarah.  Depressed and still taking the breakup very hard, he takes his brother's advice and goes on vacation to Hawaii.  A chance for him to get away.In Hawaii, not sure what he's going to do, he is helped by the hotel receptionist, Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis) but as he prepares to get on with his vacation, he spots his ex-girlfriend Sarah at the same hotel.  It appears that Sarah and her boyfriend, rock singer Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) also chose to go on vacation to Hawaii.  The experience is humiliating for Peter, especially for the fact that she's already found someone and to make things worse, she's in the same area and the same hotel.So, it seems his vacation in Hawaii is going to be be difficult as there is possibly no way for him to forget his ex-girlfriend.  But fortunately, things may change when Rachel shows him a part of her world.""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" also features a crazy group of characters such as Darald (Jack McBrayer) and Wyoma (Maria Thayer) as the Mormon newlyweds who try to have awesome sex, Chuck (Paul Rudd) as the surfing instructor who acts as if drugs have cost him precious brain cells, the Aldous Snow fanboy and restaurant waiter Matthew (Jonah Hill) and many more.The Blu-ray comes with both theatrical and unrated versions of the film.  Also, a second disc with a digital copy of the film is included in the release.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1) and in 2008, it was one of the first Blu-rays released that showed us how lush and beautiful Hawaii can look via High Definition.  The film is absolutely vibrant, skies and oceans are blue, the green lush foliage and trees in the background and of course, the vibrant bikini's come out in full force.  There is no doubt that this film sports eye-popping colors and I found no digital artifacts and for the most part, the film does not have excessive DNR (digital noise reduction) or banding problems.  Blacks are nice and deep and for the most part, this Blu-ray does feature awesome picture quality.As for the audio, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (Spanish and French via DTS 5.1) . The film for the most part is a dialogue driven film.  There are scenes that utilize music but for the most part, this is a front and center channel driven film and the lossless audio track works well for this type of film.  Dialogue is clear and understandable but there are times where I had to turn on the English subtitles to understand some dialogue.As for subtitles, the film is presented with English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Forgetting Sarah Marshall: Unrated"" is one Blu-ray release that comes with hours of special features.  Included are:* Audio Commentary with Director Nicholas Stoller, writer/actor Jason Segel, executive producer Rodney Rothman, producer Shauna Robertson, Mila Kunis, Russell Brand, Jack McBrayer (via phone) and Kristin Bell (via phone) - The film features a hilarious audio commentary.  While scenes are discussed and everyone is having a blast making jokes and talking about their role and their experiences. Also, learning about the film and how it was inspired by Segel's real life breakup and the incorporation of Segel's dracula puppet play.* U-Control - If there is one thing that I enjoy about Universal Blu-ray releases and that is the U-Control feature.  With most picture-in-picture, some viewers tend to have to switch the audio portion of their Blu-ray player to hear the sounds of the picture-in-picture commentary but with U-Control, you can select the visual commentary (featuring the people involved with the audio commentary) via picture-in-picture, picture-in-picture featuring behind-the-scenes footage and also the karaoke portions.  U-Control shows you the chapter breakdowns and which scene has which function which is nice.* Karaoke - (17:42) A total of six videos with karaoke with or without karaoke subtitles.  Included are Russell Brand's ""We've Got to Do Something"" and ""Inside of You"", Jason Segel's ""Dracula's Lament"" and ""A Taste for Love"" and the Hawaiian ""Hula Medley"" and ""Home on the Range"".* Deleted and Extended Scenes (19:24) - Eleven deleted and extended scenes which include: Scooter, Lamp 1, Lamp 2, Horseback Riding, Darold and Wyoma at the Luau, Peter plays drunk piano, lip reading, Sarah and Aldous in bed, aborted sex, airport goodbye and ""What are you gonna do now?"".  I know that some of these were trimmed to keep the final cut time down but there are some that some may feel should have been in the final cut.* Puppet Backup - (2:28)  A scene not in the final cut of the film from ""A Taste for Love"" featuring Dracula getting dumped.* Line-O-Rama - (7:47) Improvisational scenes in which the talent keep doing their own improv versions of a scene and various cuts.* Sex-O-Rama - (2:42) Sex scenes that were cut out of the film.* Drunk-O-Rama - (2:29)  A scene with Peter and the bar drinking down many various types of alcohol and various cuts featuring him experimenting with the alcohol.* Gag Reel - (5:44) A hilarious blooper featurette.* The Making of ""A Taste for Love"" - (6:17) A featurette about how Peter's dracula play which he created many years ago became part of the film.  The crew were a bit iffy but in the end, everything worked out well.  Also, working with Jim Henson's Creature Shop and training with puppets.* Dracula's Lament (Table Read 4/7/07) - (3:12) A hilarious table read featuring the segment in which Jason Segel had to showcase his Dracula song, definitely taking the other actors and crew by surprise.* Russell Brand: Aldous Snow - (5:55) How the casting of Russell Brand changed the film's screenplay from a British writer to a British rockstar and what he was able to bring to the film.* The Letter ""U"" - (3:45) In Sesame Street-style of fashion, what if Aldous Snow had to appear on the show and present the letter ""U"" and be around kids.* ""We've Got to Do Something"" Music Video - (3:47) Aldous Snow's music video* Crime Scene - (4:10) Footage from Sarah Marshall's drama series ""Crime Scene"" with Billy Baldwin as Detective Hunter Rush.  Also, includes Hunter Line-O-Rama (1:53) featuring Baldwin's improvisational scenes.* Sarah's New Show ""Alts"" - (2:14) Footage from Sarah Marshall's new animal psychic drama series.* Raw Footage Video Chat - (7:12) Via splitscreen, we learn how the video chat between Jason Segel's character and Bill Hader and Liz Cackowski's characters were created.* Video Diaries - (35:16) - A total of 21 videos with an option to watch all or watch each separately.  The making of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" through 21 days of video diaries featuring behind-the-scenes making of the film.* Red Brand Trailer - (2:55) Red Brand trailer of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" which includes profanity.JUDGMENT CALL:I actually enjoyed ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" a lot.  There are a lot of things going for this film, from it's hilarious screenplay, the colorful characters in the film, witty dialogue and of course, it helps that the film was filmed in beautiful Hawaii.I absolutely adore Kristin Bell and Mila Kunis from their own respective TV shows but of course, the big surprise of this film is Jason Segel.  It's one thing to write and star in our own film but the ""How I Met Your Mother"" star really surprised people by going full frontal and full rear in the film..  I suppose with so many of these wild and crazy films typically showing nude women, the film went the other direction by showing a nude guy and suffice to say, the film generated a lot of talk and hype because of it.But like most Judd Apatow films which are wild and crazy, the film would also showcase British comedian Russell Brand and definitely introduce him to American viewers and again, many other talents who have been able to transcend from being a television star to appearing on major films.As for the Blu-ray release, the unrated version features seven minutes of extra footage which showcase more about Peter's character and his funk that he's in due to Sarah being with Aldous.  So, for those wondering if it's more of Jason Segel full frontal scenes, fortunately it's not the case.""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is definitely one of the most beautiful Blu-ray releases to come out in 2008.  I had no doubt in my mind that capturing Hawaii on film and for High Definition is going to look beautiful.  The Blu-ray definitely shows off eye-popping visuals and although the lossless soundtrack has no action sequences to show off an audiophile's 7.2 or more home theater setup, the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless track gives us clarity with the dialogue and music also comes out alive as well via the front channels.  And of course, fans of special features are just going to love this Blu-ray release for the sheer amount of content that is included.Overall, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a wild and crazy film that has a lot of positive things going for it.  Sure, the comedy is similar to the crazy style of antics of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" and other Apatow-related films but overall, it was a hilarious film worth watching and also worth having in your Blu-ray collection.",5,"Blu-ray: Awesome picture quality, loaded with special features and overall, hilarious and fun!",1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,11302,"['Hilariously',

As a womanizing, psuedo-philosophising rock star, Brand is fun to watch--but only in small doses.

1173645,A3UHWNH1PZYEUJ,B001C0JCBA,DonkaDoo,"[10, 24]","Forgetting Sarah Marshall or ""I Keep Forgetting the title to this movie"" is not very funny. ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked up""--both Judd Apatow movies, were by far the most surprising, hilarious movies in a LONG time. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is nowhere close. The critics are raving for some reason (86% approval rating on rottentomatoes.com). I think they just know that Apatow does funny movies, and since critics inherently have no since of humor--they can't seem to figure out if it's funny or not so just assume it is based on Apatow's track record. I mean I laughed out loud at a few scenes and quotes, but the story as a whole is disjointed and bad.Typically Apatow movies have a strong supporting cast with a previous history of working together and having a ball doing it. ""Sarah Marshall"" has a weak supporting cast (though due mostly to the hacked together script) and the leads are boring to watch--especially Sarah Marshall (Kristin Bell) (though the clips from ""Crime Scene"" are funny). Peter's budding love interest, Rachel Jansen, played by Mila Kunis who I always liked from ""That 70s Show"" and ""Family Guy,"" sucks.  The main character is okay (Jason Segel, funnily enough he also wrote ""Sarah Marshall"")--he shows his penis btw...Very brave of him to share it with us. Sadly, Jonah Hill (Superbad) isn't even funny in this one. The highlights are: Paul Rudd's Chuck ""Kuna"" the surfer dude,"" Aldous (Russell Brand), Marshall's undulating uber-horny, rock-star British boyfriend and the virgin (Morman? Jahovah Witness? Evangelical?) couple on holiday. PS: Darald (Jack McBrayer), the male  looks a LOT like Clay Aiken. Or are we all just calling him Gayken now?Much of the humor is forced and heavily scripted. Nothing is improvised. It's not like ""Forty-Year-Old Virgin"" where the humor is so spontaneous and surprising. I think the whole movie is built around the BeeJay scene over the computer--and what was with the computer?--he's in Hawaii why does he keep referring to his computer like he's James Bond?--I mean feigning BeeJays are funny-but not funny enough to base a movie around it.For a good time, read the parent's guide to this movie: [...] It's hilarious!!!Fave Quote: ""God put our mouths on our head for a reason.

In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" the formula only creates a lukewarm movie experience.The usual cast of charming comedic actors are all entertaining and likable enough. (The breakout star of this film is Russell Brand, who shines as a benevolent womanizer.) So why does the film never really take off? It's probably the script. While in the beginning the movie explores male vulnerability and response to rejection, after the story moves to Hawaii the story mostly just becomes silly.

Most of the humor of the film is slapstick, while the basic outline of the plot is what you'd normally find in an RC film.The main character in the story is going through the most hellacious break-up you could imagine.  She is a movie star, so he sees her everywhere, including myriad commercials.  He goes to Hawaii to try & get as far away from his problem as possible, but lo & behold she and her new boyfriend are staying at the same hotel that he is!This makes for a host of awkward moments, and basically most of the humor in the film is derived from these kinds of moments that we all wish to avoid at all costs.Surprisingly, the movie does have a heart & one can't help but feeling that it's a feel-good kind of film when all is said & done.  Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis are both absolutely gorgeous, but even more poignant is that they both have a screen presence and genuine acting skills.  This film would have been pretty dull had these too been lame actresses.I watched the unrated version of the film & I must say that there wasn't much of ""shock value"" in it, other than a seeming infatuation with male nudity {which I could have done w/out}.  It was disappointing that it had a great many opportunities for female nudity, but declined to pursue it almost every time.  In that view, it was a bit of a ""teaser"" movie.All in all, this was a film that was both trenchant and very funny at the same time.  The breakup reminded me of a woman in my life who pulled the plug 4 years ago now, and yet I still can't get my mind off of her.  Hence, watching a poor fellow turn into a basket case after he's dumped by his g/f is rather cathartic - and oh so relatable.

1173649,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001C0JCBA,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 9]","As the latest offering from the prolific Judd Apatow stable, this meandering but amusing 2008 comedy probably had one of the most irritating advertising campaigns ever for a wide release movie as cryptic billboards were posted everywhere with nasty diatribes written to the title character. Having enjoyed Apatow'sThe 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Upa lot, I am starting to realize there is a bit more of a potluck feel when Apatow isn't in the director's chair. This time, first-time director Nicholas Stoller is at the helm working from a script written by the film's star, Jason Segel. Granted the comic premise is not as fresh here as in the earlier films, but it is entertaining in a ramshackle sort of way with some moments of surprising nuance. Segel plays Peter Bretter, a typical nice-guy type who writes the music (or more accurately, the sonic tones) of a network TV series that looks very much likeC.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation. The show stars his hot-babe girlfriend Sarah, and they've been together for five years, an eternity at least by Hollywood standards.The film wastes no time in setting up the central problem - Sarah abruptly dumps Peter for Brit rock star Aldous Snow, and through the plot's key contrivance, the three of them end up in the same resort in Hawaii. Naturally, Peter is devastated by the break-up, especially when he has to watch Sarah and Aldous in post-coital euphoria in a tropical honeymoon setting. Peter does find solace in the shapely form and understanding heart of Rachel Jansen, the hotel's front desk manager. All of this is fairly by-the-numbers and reminds me of the tropical shenanigans in the inferior remake ofThe Heartbreak Kid, except Segel as a writer makes all the characters likable to varying degrees. Aldous, as played dexterously by comedian Russell Brand, is a hilarious comic creation, a sexed-up, non-sequitur-spouting cast-off from Spinal Tap. Even Sarah comes across less as a vicious harpy and more as someone who felt she tried to salvage the relationship (although interpersonal communication must not be one of her strong suits).As Peter, Segel has a doughy, affable appeal though not particularly arresting for a main character. When he's not being teary-eyed over Sarah or just plain naked, he has a tendency to throw away lines in a casual manner rather than deliver them. Saddled with the toughest part, Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) acquits herself well enough as Sarah to make her character's fate more of a concern than one would expect. Late ofThat '70s Show, the saucy Mila Kunis provides a down-to-earth sexiness to Rachel. Of course, several members of the Apatow repertory company are present and accounted for - Bill Hader as Peter's sarcastic brother, Jonah Hill as a waiter with a severe man-crush on Aldous (perhaps a tweak to his role inSuperbad), and Paul Rudd as a stoned surfing instructor (Seth Rogen is conspicuously absent). Funny bits are also provided by Jack McBrayer (Kenneth on30 Rock) as a petrified honeymooner and comic Steve Landesberg as a helpful pediatrician. As usual for an Apatow movie, the movie goes on for too long, and the scenes with the competing couples, while funny, play on the predictable side, as does the inevitable ending. It's all funny enough but just not as focused as I wish it could have been.",3,The Judd Apatow Factory Produces a Genial Though Meandering Break-Up Comedy,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,3320,"['latest', 'offering', 'prolific', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'stable', 'meandering', 'amusing', '2008', 'comedy', 'probably', 'had', 'one', 'most', 'irritating', 'advertising', 'campaigns', 'ever', 'wide', 'release', 'movie', 'cryptic', 'billboards', 'were', 'posted', 'everywhere', 'nasty', 'diatribes', 'written', 'title', 'character', 'Having', 'enjoyed', ""Apatow'sThe"", '40-Year-Old', 'VirginandKnocked', 'Upa', 'lot', 'am', 'starting', 'realize', 'bit', 'more', 'potluck', 'feel', 'when', 'Apatow', ""n't"", 'director', 'chair', 'time', 'first-time', 'director', 'Nicholas', 'Stoller', 'helm', 'working', 'script', 'written', 'film', 'star', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Granted', 'comic', 'premise', 'not', 'fresh', 'here', 'earlier', 'films', 'entertaining', 'ramshackle', 'sort', 'way', 'moments', 'surprising', 'nuance', 'Segel', 'Peter', 'Bretter', 'typical', 'nice-guy', 'type', 'who', 'music', 'more', 'accurately', 'sonic', 'tones', 'network', 'TV', 'series', 'very', 'much', 'likeC.S.I', 'Crime', 'Scene', 'Investigation', 'show', 'hot-babe', 'girlfriend', 'Sarah', ""'ve"", 'been', 'together', 'five', 'years', 'eternity', 'least', 'Hollywood', 'standards.The', 'film', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'central', 'problem', 'Sarah', 'abruptly', 'Peter', 'Brit', 'rock', 'star', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'plot', 'key', 'contrivance', 'three', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'resort', 'Hawaii', 'Naturally', 'Peter', 'devastated', 'break-up', 'especially', 'when', 'watch', 'Sarah', 'Aldous', 'post-coital', 'euphoria', 'tropical', 'honeymoon', 'setting', 'Peter', 'find', 'solace', 'shapely', 'form', 'understanding', 'heart', 'Rachel', 'Jansen', 'hotel', 'front', 'desk', 'manager', 'fairly', 'by-the-numbers', 'tropical', 'shenanigans', 'inferior', 'remake', 'ofThe', 'Heartbreak', 'Kid', 'except', 'Segel', 'writer', 'characters', 'likable', 'varying', 'degrees', 'Aldous', 'played', 'dexterously', 'comedian', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'hilarious', 'comic', 'creation', 'sexed-up', 'non-sequitur-spouting', 'cast-off', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Even', 'Sarah', 'across', 'less', 'vicious', 'harpy', 'more', 'someone', 'who', 'felt', 'tried', 'salvage', 'relationship', 'interpersonal', 'communication', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'strong', 'suits', '.As', 'Peter', 'Segel', 'doughy', 'affable', 'appeal', 'not', 'particularly', 'arresting', 'main', 'character', 'When', 'not', 'being', 'teary-eyed', 'Sarah', 'just', 'plain', 'naked', 'tendency', 'throw', 'away', 'lines', 'casual', 'manner', 'rather', 'deliver', 'Saddled', 'toughest', 'part', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'well', 'enough', 'Sarah', 'make', 'character', 'fate', 'more', 'concern', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Late', ""'70s"", 'Show', 'saucy', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'down-to-earth', 'sexiness', 'Rachel', 'course', 'several', 'members', 'Apatow', 'repertory', 'company', 'are', 'present', 'accounted', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Peter', 'sarcastic', 'brother', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'waiter', 'severe', 'man-crush', 'Aldous', 'perhaps', 'tweak', 'role', 'inSuperbad', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'stoned', 'surfing', 'instructor', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'Funny', 'bits', 'are', 'also', 'provided', 'Jack', 'McBrayer', 'Kenneth', 'on30', 'Rock', 'petrified', 'honeymooner', 'comic', 'Steve', 'Landesberg', 'helpful', 'pediatrician', 'usual', 'Apatow', 'movie', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'scenes', 'competing', 'couples', 'funny', 'play', 'predictable', 'side', 'inevitable', 'ending', 'funny', 'enough', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'focused', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

The first few minutes shocked us because Peter Bretter is completely nude as he stands in front of Sarah Marshall. After a while, we realized that the purpose was to let us know that Sarah had taken everything from him, but still, it was strange to see him totally nude within the first few minutes of the movie.This is a romantic comedy and you will laugh, feel sad for the characters, a bit disgusted at times with the performance of Russell Brand, Sara Marthsll's new British or Australian boyfriend.To escape pain and loneliness, Peter takes a vacation and travels to Hawaii where... as difficult as this may sound, Sarah Marshall is on vacation with her new beau.Peter meets wonderful Mila Kunis, who plays the role of Rachel, a customer service attendant at the hotel where all the characters choose to stay. Rachel is wonderful and captures Peter's attention.Without giving away the plot, this movie is for adults only, a comedy and a romance story, interestingly it will make you laugh, but at times you may wonder why in the world have you decided to watch it?",3,Strange but funny...,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,1624,"['are', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'series', 'even', 'traveled', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'see', 'person', 'were', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'meet', 'traveling', 'elevator', 'yes', 'stayed', 'same', 'hotel', 'have', 'picture', 'prove', 'So', 'when', 'see', 'works', 'tend', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'acquiring', 'them.In', 'movie', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'role', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'actress', 'who', 'only', 'herself', 'career', 'movie', 'braking', 'up', 'long', 'time', 'boyfriend', 'Peter', 'Bretter', 'played', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'shocked', 'Peter', 'Bretter', 'completely', 'nude', 'front', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'while', 'realized', 'purpose', 'was', 'let', 'know', 'Sarah', 'had', 'taken', 'everything', 'still', 'was', 'strange', 'see', 'totally', 'nude', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie.This', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'will', 'laugh', 'feel', 'sad', 'characters', 'bit', 'disgusted', 'times', 'performance', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'Sara', 'Marthsll', 'new', 'British', 'Australian', 'boyfriend.To', 'escape', 'pain', 'loneliness', 'Peter', 'vacation', 'travels', 'Hawaii', 'where', 'as', 'difficult', 'may', 'sound', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'vacation', 'new', 'beau.Peter', 'meets', 'wonderful', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'who', 'role', 'Rachel', 'customer', 'service', 'attendant', 'hotel', 'where', 'characters', 'choose', 'stay', 'Rachel', 'wonderful', 'Peter', 'attention.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'movie', 'adults', 'only', 'comedy', 'romance', 'story', 'interestingly', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'times', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'world', 'have', 'decided', 'watch']",N/A

How many times have we seen the scenario where the untimely breakup leaves one hopelessly romantic guy desperate and utterly pathetic? Apparently, not enough. Add in plenty of blatant sexual references and you have Forgetting Sarah Marshall.Forgetting Sarah Marshal takes this premise, and one ups it by having Peter (Jason Segal) fall all over himself for nearly half the film about his ex, popular actress and Crime Scene film star Sarah Marshall (Kirsten Bell), who dumps him in the film's opening scene, a rather awkward  scene which involves unnecessary, gratuitous body parts ( Why? Who knows? Probably to ensure an R rating). Peter cries hysterically, acts irrationally, and basically grates on your nerves for much of the film's first half. (You'll might also be wondering at some point what exactly he sees in Sarah, but I guess love is blind.) It becomes a running theme that no matter where Peter goes, he will ultimately run into Sarah and her new sleek, hip rock star boyfriend Alduous (Russell Brand) once he hatches an idea to escape to Hawaii to get his mind off things (even though he knows she is going to be in Hawaii also...hint...hint...). Whether Peter is a stalker, or just a hapless romantic who holds onto relationships too hard is up to the viewer to decide in the film's early going. Things get a little more complicated when he meets Rachael, who works at the hotel he is staying at. Rachael, it seems, is also getting over a break up. You can pretty much figure out where the film is headed, as Peter begins to have feelings for Rachael while still trying to get over Sarah.I'll admit Forgetting Sarah Marshal does have a brief moments or two of some originality (the Dracula love story, Peter's interactions with the Hawaiians), but these are seldom, and most of the film is rather sluggish (especially at two hours running time). The coincidences, story line and dialogue seem contrived and forced, the scenes more painfully awkward than funny. Moreover, the supposed lesson and resolution about love and relationships is rather vacuous and empty and seems to be generated from a ""romantic comedy film machine"" or something.In the end, this movie is a rather forgettable one.2.5 stars",2,"About as painful as breaking up, 2.5 stars",1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,2392,"['Breaking', 'up', 'rather', 'painful', 'experience', 'so', 'watching', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'rather', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'scenario', 'where', 'untimely', 'breakup', 'one', 'hopelessly', 'romantic', 'guy', 'desperate', 'utterly', 'pathetic', 'Apparently', 'not', 'enough', 'Add', 'plenty', 'blatant', 'sexual', 'references', 'have', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall.Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshal', 'premise', 'one', 'ups', 'having', 'Peter', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'fall', 'nearly', 'film', 'ex', 'popular', 'actress', 'Crime', 'Scene', 'film', 'star', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Kirsten', 'Bell', 'who', 'dumps', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'rather', 'awkward', 'scene', 'unnecessary', 'gratuitous', 'body', 'parts', 'Why', 'Who', 'Probably', 'ensure', 'R', 'rating', 'Peter', 'cries', 'hysterically', 'irrationally', 'basically', 'grates', 'nerves', 'much', 'film', 'first', 'half', ""'ll"", 'might', 'also', 'be', 'wondering', 'point', 'what', 'exactly', 'Sarah', 'guess', 'love', 'blind', 'running', 'theme', 'matter', 'where', 'Peter', 'will', 'ultimately', 'run', 'Sarah', 'new', 'sleek', 'hip', 'rock', 'star', 'boyfriend', 'Alduous', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'once', 'idea', 'escape', 'Hawaii', 'get', 'mind', 'things', 'even', 'going', 'be', 'Hawaii', 'also', 'hint', 'hint', 'Peter', 'stalker', 'just', 'hapless', 'romantic', 'who', 'relationships', 'too', 'hard', 'viewer', 'decide', 'film', 'early', 'going', 'Things', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Rachael', 'who', 'hotel', 'staying', 'Rachael', 'also', 'getting', 'break', 'up', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'figure', 'where', 'film', 'headed', 'Peter', 'have', 'feelings', 'Rachael', 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'Sarah.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshal', 'have', 'brief', 'moments', 'two', 'originality', 'Dracula', 'love', 'story', 'Peter', 'interactions', 'Hawaiians', 'are', 'seldom', 'most', 'film', 'rather', 'sluggish', 'especially', 'two', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'coincidences', 'story', 'line', 'dialogue', 'seem', 'contrived', 'forced', 'scenes', 'more', 'painfully', 'awkward', 'funny', 'Moreover', 'supposed', 'lesson', 'resolution', 'love', 'relationships', 'rather', 'vacuous', 'empty', 'be', 'generated', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'film', 'machine', 'something.In', 'end', 'movie', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'one.2.5', 'stars']",N/A

""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" sets new high standards in that league of films, that portray break-up as a realistic event, and not some romantically overdone sequence of droopy love songs.Peter Bretter is a musician for a TV series, and is also the reclusive boyfriend of the lead actress of the show - Sarah Marshall. Sarah gets all the attention and the limelight, while Peter is left out in the cold corner (holding her purse). The movie begins with the break-up. So that you know where the focus of the story lies - no meaningless context-setting or flashback sequences. Cut to the chase.Peter realizes that he needs to get over Sarah, and so he decides to go to Hawaii - to a place Sarah had suggested once as a good place to visit. But, as luck would have it, Sarah is also at the same resort, with her rock singer boyfriend - which incidentally becomes first of the many secrets that Peter comes to know during his stay at the resort.He has some really interesting days there, with the cook, the waiter, the front-desk girl, the front-desk girl's ex-boyfriend... you get the drift. Soon enough, pretty much everyone knows that Peter is in the hotel, and that he is the ex-boyfriend of Sarah, who is also at the hotel.What follows is a really hilarious look at a guy's perspective of breaking-up with his girlfriend of five years (well, at least he thinks so!), and how he copes with his grief. While some scenes might look outright unbelievable to some (like when there's the sound of a woman sobbing from Peter's room...), they go really well with his character in the story, and Jason does an extremely good job at portraying a goofy doofus of a guy, who is more confused about his life than a M&ouml;bius strip!It makes you realize just how hard it really is - no matter how easy the movies make it look by filling it up with a song by Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor or something similar. Like Peter says, ""maybe it's because you broke my heart into a million pieces..."".What I said earlier about no flashbacks just implied none at the beginning of the movie. Throughout the story, you get these one- or half-a-minute snippets from the earlier life of the characters, like from before the movie picks up. These flashes are very well edited and superbly placed throughout the script, and they pepper up the storyline every now and then.An excellent piece of work from the team that brought you Knocked Up and Superbad.Overall Score: 4 / 5",4,"Finally, a sensible and realistic movie about breaking-up",1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,2551,"['have', 'been', 'dozens', 'movies', 'made', 'breaking-up', 'be', 'woman', 'perspective', 'man', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'new', 'high', 'standards', 'league', 'films', 'portray', 'break-up', 'realistic', 'event', 'not', 'romantically', 'overdone', 'sequence', 'droopy', 'love', 'songs.Peter', 'Bretter', 'musician', 'TV', 'series', 'also', 'reclusive', 'boyfriend', 'lead', 'actress', 'show', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Sarah', 'attention', 'limelight', 'Peter', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'corner', 'holding', 'purse', 'movie', 'break-up', 'know', 'where', 'focus', 'story', 'meaningless', 'context-setting', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'Cut', 'chase.Peter', 'get', 'Sarah', 'so', 'go', 'Hawaii', 'place', 'Sarah', 'had', 'suggested', 'once', 'good', 'place', 'visit', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Sarah', 'also', 'same', 'resort', 'rock', 'singer', 'boyfriend', 'incidentally', 'first', 'many', 'secrets', 'Peter', 'know', 'stay', 'resort.He', 'really', 'interesting', 'days', 'there', 'cook', 'waiter', 'front-desk', 'girl', 'front-desk', 'girl', 'ex-boyfriend', 'get', 'drift', 'Soon', 'enough', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'Peter', 'hotel', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Sarah', 'who', 'also', 'hotel.What', 'really', 'hilarious', 'look', 'guy', 'perspective', 'breaking-up', 'girlfriend', 'five', 'years', 'well', 'least', 'so', 'how', 'grief', 'scenes', 'might', 'look', 'outright', 'unbelievable', 'when', 'sound', 'woman', 'sobbing', 'Peter', 'room', 'go', 'really', 'well', 'character', 'story', 'Jason', 'extremely', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'goofy', 'doofus', 'guy', 'who', 'more', 'confused', 'life', 'M', 'ouml', 'strip', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'really', 'matter', 'how', 'easy', 'movies', 'make', 'look', 'filling', 'up', 'song', 'Sin', 'eacute', 'ad', ""O'Connor"", 'something', 'similar', 'Peter', 'maybe', 'broke', 'heart', 'million', 'pieces', '.What', 'said', 'earlier', 'flashbacks', 'just', 'implied', 'none', 'beginning', 'movie', 'story', 'get', 'one-', 'half-a-minute', 'snippets', 'earlier', 'life', 'characters', 'movie', 'up', 'flashes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'edited', 'superbly', 'placed', 'script', 'pepper', 'up', 'storyline', 'now', 'then.An', 'excellent', 'piece', 'work', 'team', 'brought', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Superbad.Overall', 'Score', '4', '/', '5']",N/A

From his first appearance on-screen, I was reminded of Spinal Tap.  He's over the top ridiculous as a rock star, and that's the funniest thing about this movie.The Bad: Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Fool me four times and I must be an idiot.  Such is the case apparently.  After Knocked Up, I swore I wouldn't see another Apatow film.  But since I like Jason Segel (at least, I like him best of the Apatow acting clan) and the preview looked pretty funny, I gave him one more chance.  I guess you could say he didn't disappoint ... because the movie did.  Jason Segel's gratuitous nudity was just silly and even a bit uncomfortable.  Let's be honest, he doesn't have the rump for it.  And the frontal nudity was clearly just for shock value.  While this movie wasn't horrible (like Superbad), it just wasn't all that funny.  There were a few chuckles, but this is definitely not comedic genius.The Summary: To be fair, this movie is probably a 2.5 star but I rounded down on this one.  The preview did a decent job of summarizing this movie ... Not famous boy is boyfriend of famous beautiful girl.  Famous beautiful girl is cheating with rock star and dumps boyfriend for rock star.  Decision turns out to be a mistake, but before she realizes it, boyfriend is utterly depressed and having trouble getting over her.  Boyfriend goes to Hawaii to forget his troubles but winds up running into his ex and her new love there.  While in Hawaii, boyfriend finds a new dish of his own.

She dumps him suddenly and he can't get over it. His brother in-law (Bill Hadar) talks him into going to Hawaii but getting over her there is gonna be hard since...she's also there with her new Rockstar b/f (Russel Brand). He meets  a super cute hostess at the motel he's staying at though, played by Mila Kunis (That 70's Show, voice of Meg in Family Guy). But will she be enough to get over Sarah Marshall ? The answer is probably obvious but this movie is still very funny.You have everyone giving their A game. Jason Segel who I've liked in How I Met Your Mother but I never really saw him as sar material until I saw him in Knocked Up. He was hilarious in that and he's very funny in this as well. He's not even afraid to show his penis just for a shock and laughs. While Kristen Bell shows that she also has a future in movies and this time she chose the right movie. I mean since lets face it, Pulse sucked. She's both funny and sexy in this but once I saw Mile Kunis I almost forgot that Kristen Bell was even in it lol. She's her sexiest ever in this movie. Eventhough the girls are hot, the guys in it are funnier. I think most of the laughs come from Russel Brand and Paul Rudd as a surfer who gives Segel lessons. Jonah Hill (Superbad, Knocked Up) is also funny as a hotel employee that's obsessed with Russel Brand's rockstar character. There's also good laughs from when the tv series is shown with William Baldwin playing Bell's partner who's basically spoofing on David Caruso in CSI.

1173681,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001C0JCBA,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Produced by Judd Apatow and with a cast of Apatow regulars, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a unique and hilarious comedy written by and starring Jason Segel. The comedy won rave reviews from critics and audiences and the reason why is simple...It's a terrific comedy.Segel plays Peter Bretter, a musician who composes the music for the television show his girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kirsten Bell) is on. One day, out of nowhere, Sarah breaks up with Peter, leaving him completely devastated. His stepbrother (Bill Hader) suggests he go to Hawaii, to try and forget about Sarah Marshall. When Peter arrives at the hotel in Hawaii, he finds that Sarah is staying there as well with her rock star boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Trying desperately to keep his mind off Sarah, Peter sets his eyes on desk clerk Rachel (Mila Kunis), while encountering all the eccentric people of the island.That last part sounds familiar doesn't it? Of course Peter encounters all sorts of eccentric characters that just happen to be hysterically funny, right? Well, Segel's script is better than that...The people he meets on the island are all their own characters with their own personalities and many of them are Apatow regulars like Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill (whose first scene is one of the funniest scenes in the film) as an obsessive Aldous Snow fan.Yes, Segel's script has great characterization. What's the last movie you saw featuring a main character writing a rock opera with puppets? The acting helps though and while no one would win an Oscar for their acting here, all the actor's are perfect in their roles. Segel isn't the best looking guy in the world, but he does have a unique, laid-back, comedic charm. And, while he plays the depression of Peter for laughs, he actually does hit the right notes for a character reeling from a sudden break-up. Brand too stands out as the arrogant, memorable Aldous Snow.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a terrific comedy quite simply. It's vulgar but much of it's comedy comes from the personal quirks of it's characters as opposed to the situations they find themselves in. It's not perfect, but it's funny and unique enough to make one look past it's imperfections. There's enough hilarious scenes and bits of dialogue here to fill several comedies.GRADE: A-",5,"Quite Simply,  A Terrific Comedy",1253318400,"09 19, 2009",2009,2295,"['Produced', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'cast', 'Apatow', 'regulars', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'unique', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'written', 'starring', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'comedy', 'won', 'rave', 'reviews', 'critics', 'audiences', 'reason', 'why', 'simple', 'terrific', 'comedy.Segel', 'plays', 'Peter', 'Bretter', 'musician', 'who', 'music', 'television', 'show', 'girlfriend', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Kirsten', 'Bell', 'One', 'day', 'nowhere', 'Sarah', 'up', 'Peter', 'leaving', 'completely', 'devastated', 'stepbrother', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'go', 'Hawaii', 'try', 'forget', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'When', 'Peter', 'hotel', 'Hawaii', 'Sarah', 'staying', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'rock', 'star', 'boyfriend', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'Trying', 'desperately', 'keep', 'mind', 'Sarah', 'Peter', 'eyes', 'desk', 'clerk', 'Rachel', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'encountering', 'eccentric', 'people', 'island.That', 'last', 'part', 'familiar', ""n't"", 'course', 'Peter', 'sorts', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'right', 'Well', 'Segel', 'script', 'better', 'people', 'island', 'are', 'own', 'characters', 'own', 'personalities', 'many', 'are', 'Apatow', 'regulars', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'first', 'scene', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'film', 'obsessive', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'fan.Yes', 'Segel', 'script', 'great', 'characterization', 'What', 'last', 'movie', 'saw', 'featuring', 'main', 'character', 'writing', 'rock', 'opera', 'puppets', 'acting', 'one', 'would', 'win', 'Oscar', 'acting', 'here', 'actor', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Segel', ""n't"", 'best', 'looking', 'guy', 'world', 'have', 'unique', 'laid-back', 'comedic', 'charm', 'depression', 'Peter', 'laughs', 'actually', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'character', 'reeling', 'sudden', 'break-up', 'Brand', 'too', 'out', 'arrogant', 'memorable', 'Aldous', 'Snow.Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'terrific', 'comedy', 'quite', 'simply', 'vulgar', 'much', 'comedy', 'personal', 'quirks', 'characters', 'opposed', 'situations', 'find', 'not', 'perfect', 'funny', 'unique', 'enough', 'make', 'one', 'look', 'imperfections', 'enough', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'here', 'fill', 'several', 'comedies.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

1173683,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B001C0JCBA,K. Driscoll,"[2, 3]","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is another successful comedy in a long line of successful comedies produced by Judd Apatow (Superbad,Knocked Up,Pineapple Express).  Screenwriter Nicholas Stoller directs his first film while actor Jason Segal writes.  Segal of course also plays the film's main protagonist, Peter Bretter, a composer for a crime scene investigation television drama that stars his girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell).  Sarah breaks up with Peter and the story begins.  Segal has been around for a while on television (Freaks and Geeks,How I Met Your Mother) while also appearing in smaller roles for films (SLC Punk, Knocked Up).  It is nice to see him get a feature role in a huge comedy while at the same time delivering a top-notch comedy screenplay.  His talents are undeniable.As the film goes on after Sarah breaks up with Peter, we are introduced to various characters that are both interesting and very funny.  British rock star Aldous Snow is played by Russell Brand, who is probably the film's highlight for me, although Peter's married step-brother and his wife, played by Bill Hader and Liz Cackowski, are great as well.  Mila Kunis stars as Peter's potential rebound girlfriend after his breakup with Sarah.

Jason Segel from ""Knocked Up"" plays Peter Bretter whose girlfriend breaks up with him.  Segel wrote the screenplay & bares all in the beginning of the film, which was startling.  But he plays it in a very matter-of-fact way, seemingly comfortable even though not the most toned of men.  His girlfriend is Sarah Marshall who is running on a crime scene TV show.  Kristen Bell who is currently on TV's ""Heroes"" & was ""Veronica Mars"" in that series does an incredible acting job.  The fine delicacy of emotion that comes across her face, the sorrowful regret as she breaks up with Peter, and the desire to come back to him are communicated with the depth one might achieve while standing on the first step walking down into the shallow end of the pool.  She's also beautiful, but not overly funny.  Mila Kunis from TV's ""That 70s Show"" & recently in ""Max Payne"" is both beautiful, touching & funny.  As Rachel, she well handles the levels of sticking up for herself, romantic lead & funny sidekick to Peter.  Russell Brand as the narcissistic rock star Aldous who is Sarah's new boyfriend preens and prances in hilarious fashion.  Paul Rudd turns in an excellent comic performance as the air-headed surfing instructor.  He was also inKnocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)as well asAnchorman - The Legend Of Ron Burgundy (Unrated Widescreen Edition)& currently in the hilarious ""Role Models.""  Jonah Hill who was in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" & ""Knocked Up,"" shows up as a waiter with an agenda.  Bill Hader from TV's ""Saturday Night Live"" & ""Superbad"" plays Peter's brother Brian.  Brian's wife Liz is played by ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni Liz Cackowski.

Here's what I liked:Jason Segal as the guy who gets dumped. He was the picture of morose self pity and the story's beginning, and his performance grew more subtle as the plot progressed. Essentially, it's about a nice but shallow guy who learns from his pain to be a more self aware, emotionally connected man, and Segal demonstrated this transformation with style and grace.Russell Brand as Aldous Snow, for whom Jason got dumped. Brand's relaxed, somewhat deadpan delivery turned his portrayal of the ultra-self-centered British rock star into brilliant parody.Some of the humor. There are some genuinely funny moments, and the send up on today's forensic and mystical TV series is one of the best.The supporting cast, each of whom is spot on in their eccentricities.What I disliked:Sarah Marshall. Although Kristen Bell's performance cannot be faulted, Sarah is simply shallow. Apart from her appearance, there's not much there that's appealing.The movie's pacing. Strong start, stagnating center, strong end. It left the impression that the story actually lacked a center, and the director filled the empty space with gratuitous, graphic sex scenes. LOTS of them.

1173698,A1FG91CM8221X1,B001C0JCBA,Miles D. Moore,"[5, 5]","As producer, director and writer, Judd Apatow has made a specialty of having his characters getting caught, literally, with their pants down. He uses blatantly, outrageously sexual situations to reveal men and women in all their sad, hilarious vulnerability. In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""--co-produced by Apatow, directed by Nicholas Stoller and written by Jason Segel--lead character Peter Bretter (Segel) is literally caught full frontal at both the beginning and the end, all the better to capture the naked insecurities of this sweet, funny boy-man. Peter, composer for a TV detective show, has been in a five-year relationship with the show's glamorous star, the eponymous Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). So he is blindsided by Sarah's sudden announcement that she has fallen in love with horndog rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Heartbroken Peter goes off to a swank Hawaiian resort to try to forget--only to find that Sarah and Aldous are at the same resort. The rest of the movie is a compendium of the various types of cringing embarrassment ex-lovers can face when confronted with each other, as well as the various fumbling efforts to try and forge new relationships--in Peter's case, with the gorgeous desk clerk Rachel (Mila Kunis). All of the movie's stars are delightful, especially Segel, a younger and (somewhat) sexier version of Rodney Dangerfield. There are sharp supporting performances all along the film's genial, raunchy way, including those of Bill Hader as Peter's snarky stepbrother, Jonah Hill as an alternately cringing and arrogant waiter, DeVone McDonald as a crazed bartender, Jack McBrayer as a straitlaced newlywed and Paul Rudd as a space-case surfer dude. As with a previous Apatow-produced film, ""Superbad,"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is filled with explicit sex and profanity, yet its overwhelming mood is one of sweetness and geniality.

Peter has been dating the show's star, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), for five years when she tells him it's over. Poor Peter is crushed. To help him recover, he takes a vacation to Hawaii, where he runs into none other than . . . Sarah. With her hot new boyfriend/pop star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand, who I don't really like on principle, but who was abso-freakin'-lutely HILARIOUS in this). Peter finds consolation, and the strength to move on, in the arms of sweet hotel employee Rachel Jansen (a radiant and real Mila Kunis).First of all, the movie is funny. The primary characters are all likable, even when they are doing unlikable things, and there is truly an ensemble feeling to the cast. All the characters, even the ones with small roles, feel important to the story. Performances are wonderful. Segel shines as heartbroken Peter, Bell is appropriately gorgeous and self-centered as Sarah, and Paul Rudd makes a wonderful small appearance as a laid-back surf instructor.I thought that the real star of the film, though, was Kunis. In this picture, she proves that she's much more than Jackie from ""That 70's Show."" This chick can act. Her Rachel is a fully realized, rounded character, and I thought she was the glue that held the entire movie together.My only gripe? Nix the male frontal nudity, people. I know that Segel claimed to have been broken up with while naked in real life. And I know the awkward comedic moment is becoming a trusty standby. But GEEZ. Do I have to see such things? Can't we leave some of this to the imagination? It just seemed so contrived and . . . unecessary. Didn't think it added to the film.

Peter who is a composer scores a CSI-like hit TV show and is in a passionate 5 years relationship with the show's star Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). One day while Peter is whittling away the hours as he usually does, he receives a call from Sarah saying that she will be by soon. It seems Sarah isn't as happy in the relationship as Peter is and as he thought she was and a break-up appears immanent. After some back and forth Peter discovers there is someone else. Peter is devastated and after attempting to pull himself back together decides a vacation is in order and sets off for Hawaii only to discover that Sarah is there with her new boyfriend, rock star Aldous Snow(Russell Band). On the verge of packing it in and going home the desk clerk at the hotel Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis) locates Peter a room and wackiness ensues...Being a fan of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"", ""Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"" and ""Superbad (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"" I was curious to see this but went in with lower expectations as the magic the creators capture usually begins to fade the more and more they create and the jokes and gimmicks they had relied on begin falling flat. I was pleasantly surprised with ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""however and a slightly more serious tone was taken and the movie worked really well. This isn't to say the some of the same kind of humor and hijinks found in the previous movies isn't found here because it is. The degree in which it is employed has been pulled back just the right amount for slightly more serious movie.The Good: All of the elements that were enjoyable in ""Knocked Up"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin"" are present here. A slight change in direction in the cast as Seth Rogan isn't cast and a more serious Jason Segel who also wrote the movie takes the lead. This was a good move for this movie as Segel causes a slight change in the tone of the movie.

Even years later, it still doesn't seem to be mentioned as often as I think it deserves to be. It's another one of Judd Apatows productions, and you can pretty much tell. To me, Judd Apatow productions almost always have great characters with depth, a million different combinations of unrehersed lines to choose from in any given take, fantastic commentary tracks, and an overall light hearted spirit no matter what the characters are suffering through on screen. I never get bored watching this film. Even to this day, I laugh seemingly from beginning to end. It's just a great experience. You feel connected to the characters, and aside from having a sharp script, that is mostly because of the fine performances by the cast. Jason Segel never disappoints me. He is just a tall, awkward and lovable guy. His performance is a worthy lead to this fantastic cast. Besides Segel's great performance, Russell Brand is nothing short of perfection in his sleazy role. His portrayal of the easy going, sex addicted, English musician Aldous Snow was just awesome. (Now the spin-off is another story) I laughed so much at the two of them playing off each other, that I actually had to watch the movie a few more times to fully appreciate all the other actors.Along with the two of them I have to mention Davon McDonald as the bartender. He was hilarious. ""Snuffleupagus ****s my **** UP!"" is one of my favorite lines ever. It's just so off beat and random. Also, Paul Rudd, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Bill Hader (my second favorite SNL cast member after Kristen Wiig), Jack McBryer and Jonah Hill were all great in their roles of varying sizes. When it first came out, that wasn't really a cast of very attractive names, but that was one of the many things I loved about the movie. Now, they're all big stars. I'm sure if released today, this movie would be a tremendous hit. Not to say it was a flop. It just could've been much bigger. Honestly, I do not have much negative to say about the movie. It may run a bit long for acomedy of this nature, but it doesn't run nearly as long as Apatow's directed films. it was a very good movie, and in my opinion, it did not get as much attention as it deserved. The transfer isn't stellar either, but it's definitely good enough. It has a similar vibe to the movie. Sort of soft, laid back. Not really trying to impress, just getting its job done.

1173730,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001C0JCBA,RMurray847,"[6, 7]","Everyone who writes about FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL always spends a great deal of time discussing the fact that star & writer Jason Segal (FREAKS & GEEKS) goes ""full frontal.""  I will thus not spend any time on that at all...except to say that it's something how much an audience of adult viewers gets the giggles over split second glimpses of a 6'4"", slightly out of shape man in all his glory.  Probably an entire article right there...but I'm not going to dwell on it.  Nope...just going to move right along.The movie follows the ""Apatow"" formula.  It's full of raunchy humor, which is leavened by moments of real humanity and sweetness.  It's a hard-R movie...but it's got a PG heart.  Segal plays a young composer of TV theme music who is in a long term relationship with Sarah Marshall (VERONICA MARS' Kristen Bell), the star of the show he writes for.  As the movie begins, she dumps him for another man, leaving poor Segal a weeping wreck.  On the advice of his friend (played by SNL's underappreciated Bill Hader), he goes on vacation to ""get away from it all,"" but of course, he goes to a Hawaiian resort that his girlfriend always talked about.  Turns out, Sarah has gone there too...with her new boyfriend, a delightfully over-the-top rock singer named Aldous (a hilarious Russell Brand). Poor Segal is humiliated to be caught alone at this romantic resort, but he's befriended by a kindly desk clerk (Mila Kunis, from THAT `70'S SHOW), who at first just comes to the poor guys defense...and naturally they end up in a relationship.What's great about the movie is the way in which each character is shown at their best and at their worst.  While we sympathize with our hero...we also see elements of his character that would have driven Sarah away.  He's a slob who isn't exactly motivated to work hard.  And while we're trained to dislike Sarah, we see that she's had her share of pain as well.  Best of all, in many ways, was Aldous (played by Russell Brand)...a boorish rock star with ridiculous, entendre filled lyrics but also with an interesting, open-hearted outlook on life.  He's a cad at times...yet he's also actually quite generous of spirit.  He treats the feelings of others casually at times...but he's remarkably in tune to those feelings too.  Brand wins the MVP award for this film.  Kunis is a bit dull in comparison...she's more idealized than fleshed out...but it's a big step in her career nonetheless.Special mention to the always hilarious Paul Rudd, in a smallish role as a stoned surfing instructor (is there another kind?).  His brief appearances always lead to big laughs...and Rudd is such a charming and goofy performer that I always perk up when he's in anything.  You'll recognize other folks from the Apatow stable of performers, too.The movie is fun and funny and touching.  It also has the FUNNIEST PUPPET SHOW EVER!  I'll leave it at that...but trust me...you've not seen anything quite like it.  Segal has written himself quite a nice star vehicle and shown himself to be a fairly inventive writer as well.The movie is arguably a little long...probably there are two or three scenes which add little to the overall film...too much of Segal moping around.  We get it...he's upset about the breakup.  Other than that, everything is wrapped up in a satisfying manner, and if you stay through the first minute or so of credits...you'll see that ALL the main characters have a resolution.While not as flat out remarkable as KNOCKED UP (nor as amazingly raunchy as SUPERBAD), you won't soon forget FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL.

I was delighted to see her in this, but beyond that I didn't find much to love. Were there some funny jokes? Well, a few. Was there a compelling plot? Well, as in all other Jud Apatow related productions, absolutely not. I know that I'm probably in the minority here, but I've yet to see a film by this film collective that either featured characters that I cared about or a story that I found interesting or memorable. There are a few funny moments, but not much more than that.Is there something that I'm missing about Jud Apatow and Company? Or do other people simply have very low standards? Are others lazy in not insisting on narrative consistency and a tightly constructed script? Or am I being too demanding? Frankly, I value my time. And while I've found all of the Apatow et al. productions moderately entertaining, I've yet to see a single one (with the exception of FREAKS AND GEEKS) that I believe that I'll ever see more than once. My fear is that Hollywood will look at the huge box office generated by these essentially mediocre productions and as a result settle for a growing string of at-best average comedies. Honestly, this may well be one of the low points in the history of the film comedy.It isn't that this film was completely devoid of good moments. While Kristen Bell's title character wasn't especially likable (she isn't supposed to be), she was just as lovely as always, with considerably more talent than the role demanded. And she has one of the most transcendentally beautiful smiles I've ever seen. I'm not a Jason Segal fan and nothing that I saw here changed that opinion. I found Bill Hader, as in other roles, to be a pretty irritating presence. That goes double for Jonah Hill, who has to be one of my least favorite actors in the world. And Mila Kunis's character made no sense. What emotionally healthy human being would be attracted by a man who was devastated by his recent break up? On the plus sign I did enjoy Paul Rudd's small role as a surf instructor. And Russell Brand was sometimes funny as a utterly idiotic rock star.Honestly, I've bumped my rating up a star or two due to Kristen Bell. If you are a fan of classic film comedy you will probably give this around a two-star rating. If you don't place many demands on your comic films and like the Apatow group's other productions, you'd probably give this four stars.",3,Another mildly funny film from the Jud Apatow combine,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,2511,"['love', 'Kristen', 'Bell', ""'ve"", 'never', 'quite', 'gotten', 'over', 'cancellation', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'show', 'absence', 'past', 'season', 'was', 'acutely', 'felt', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'love', 'Were', 'there', 'funny', 'jokes', 'Well', 'few', 'Was', 'compelling', 'plot', 'Well', 'other', 'Jud', 'Apatow', 'related', 'productions', 'absolutely', 'not', 'know', ""'m"", 'probably', 'minority', 'here', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'film', 'film', 'collective', 'featured', 'characters', 'cared', 'about', 'story', 'found', 'interesting', 'memorable', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'that.Is', 'something', ""'m"", 'missing', 'Jud', 'Apatow', 'Company', 'do', 'other', 'people', 'simply', 'have', 'very', 'low', 'standards', 'Are', 'others', 'lazy', 'not', 'insisting', 'narrative', 'consistency', 'tightly', 'constructed', 'script', 'am', 'being', 'too', 'demanding', 'Frankly', 'value', 'time', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Apatow', 'al', 'productions', 'moderately', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'single', 'one', 'exception', 'FREAKS', 'AND', 'GEEKS', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'more', 'once', 'fear', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'look', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'generated', 'essentially', 'mediocre', 'productions', 'result', 'settle', 'growing', 'string', 'at-best', 'average', 'comedies', 'Honestly', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'low', 'points', 'history', 'film', 'comedy.It', ""n't"", 'film', 'was', 'completely', 'devoid', 'good', 'moments', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'title', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'especially', 'likable', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'lovely', 'always', 'considerably', 'more', 'talent', 'role', 'demanded', 'one', 'most', 'transcendentally', 'beautiful', 'smiles', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'fan', 'nothing', 'saw', 'here', 'changed', 'opinion', 'found', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'other', 'roles', 'be', 'pretty', 'irritating', 'presence', 'double', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'who', 'be', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'actors', 'world', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'character', 'made', 'sense', 'What', 'emotionally', 'healthy', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'devastated', 'recent', 'break', 'up', 'plus', 'sign', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'small', 'role', 'surf', 'instructor', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'was', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'utterly', 'idiotic', 'rock', 'star.Honestly', ""'ve"", 'bumped', 'rating', 'up', 'star', 'two', 'due', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'are', 'fan', 'classic', 'film', 'comedy', 'will', 'probably', 'give', 'two-star', 'rating', 'do', ""n't"", 'place', 'many', 'demands', 'comic', 'films', 'Apatow', 'group', 'other', 'productions', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'four', 'stars']",N/A
1173732,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001C0JCBA,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is yet another fantastic comedy from producer Judd Apatow, the man who gave us ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" a few years back.As with those previous films, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" which was written by Jason Segel (who plays the lead role) and directed by Nicholas Stoller, has as its center a fairly ordinary person just trying to make some kind sense out of a world that seemingly could care less that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In this case it's Peter Bretter, a fairly average-looking musician, whose girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Mila Kunis), the beautiful star of a cheesy TV crime drama, has just dumped him for Aldous Snow, a scruffy, longhaired rocker played by Russell Brand. In an effort to get over his loss, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii, only to discover that Sarah and Aldous are staying at the same hotel he's checking into.The element that separates ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" from so many other sex-tinged comedies these days is that it actually knows how to find humor in the offbeat moments of life. The jokes are never obvious, and the situation, though certainly contrived to some extent, is close enough to real life to make us care. Furthermore, the screenplay boasts an unusually large number of impressive secondary characters, including Bill Hader as Peter's exasperated stepbrother; Jack McBrayer (""30 Rock's Kevin the Page) as a sexually repressed man on his honeymoon; Jonah Hill as a sycophantic matre d`; Da'Vone McDonald as a blunt-spoken bartender; Paul Rudd as a zonked-out, 40ish surfer; William Baldwin and Jason Bateman as Sarah's hammy costars; Taylor Riley as a chef with a sumo wrestler build; and Kristen Bell as a sweet and gorgeous hotel clerk who has a few issues of her own lurking just beneath her deceptively placid surface.Each is a joy to watch and each brings something unique and refreshing to the comedy table.

1173737,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B001C0JCBA,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 3]","Judd Apatow's comedies (""Knocked Up,"" ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" etc.) have taken the early 2000s by storm.  His winning combination of hilarious writing and lovable schlubs - with more than a smidgen of sex and drugs - is a perfect combination for these meta, post-modern times.Apatow may not have written or directed ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" but his fingerprints are everywhere . . . which isn't surprising because he produced the flick and it was written by, directed by, and stars several of his favorite actors.  The writer-star of the picture is Jason Spegel, who plays TV composer Peter Bretter. In the first five minutes, we see Peter's Apatow-ish pathetic life - watching TV for days on end, eating gigantic bowls of sugary cereal and wearing the same old sweats every stinking day.  Then tragedy enters his idyll - his actor girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell, in a terrific performance) dumps him.After wallowing in self-pity, the movie takes off when Peter heads to Hawaii, where he checks into the same hotel where Sarah is staying with her Australian rock star boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand, hilarious).  More importantly, Peter meets hotel concierge Rachel (Mila Kunis, ""That 70s Show""), and she steals his heart and Ms. Kunis darn near steals the entire movie.Indeed, if ""FSM"" were a weaker movie, Ms. Kunis would be all anyone would talk about - she's that good.  Not only is her comic timing impeccable, she finds depths to her character that just aren't found in most comedies.  But as with so many Apatow-ish flicks, virtually every character has something inspired about him or her.  There are no cardboard cutouts here - not even Paul Rudd playing a stoned surf instructor.Look for some genuine, if comic, exploration of heartache and recovery, not to mention the regrets that Ms. Marshall must go through as she realizes that by ""trading up"" to a rock star, she may have left behind the most special guy she's ever met.  What makes the movie special, though, is that Ms. Marshall doesn't get her classic come-uppance a la so many teen movie vixens, but instead confronts the realization that Peter isn't perfect, but he's darn close . . . and that's about as much as she's entitled to.  Peter, meanwhile, learns that while Sarah has her good points, she's got more than her share of baggage even though, blast it, he loves her.All this exposition is designed with one purpose - to show you that there is a lot of heft to this movie, even though it is first and last a comedy.  And it's effing hilarious.  It's also quite raunchy, and not in a gross-out way.  Suffice it to say that there is as much male nudity as female, but there's enough of both to appeal to any taste, except perhaps grandma's.Check it out - one of the best comedies of the year.",5,"Hilarious, touching ""guy-chick flick"" keeps the Apatow spirit alive",1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,2789,"['Judd', 'Apatow', 'comedies', 'Knocked', 'Up', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'etc', 'have', 'taken', 'early', '2000s', 'storm', 'winning', 'combination', 'hilarious', 'writing', 'lovable', 'schlubs', 'more', 'smidgen', 'sex', 'drugs', 'perfect', 'combination', 'meta', 'post-modern', 'times.Apatow', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'written', 'directed', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'fingerprints', 'are', 'everywhere', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'produced', 'flick', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'several', 'favorite', 'actors', 'writer-star', 'picture', 'Jason', 'Spegel', 'who', 'TV', 'composer', 'Peter', 'Bretter', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'see', 'Peter', 'Apatow-ish', 'pathetic', 'life', 'watching', 'TV', 'days', 'end', 'eating', 'gigantic', 'bowls', 'sugary', 'cereal', 'wearing', 'same', 'old', 'sweats', 'stinking', 'day', 'Then', 'tragedy', 'enters', 'idyll', 'actor', 'girlfriend', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'terrific', 'performance', 'him.After', 'wallowing', 'self-pity', 'movie', 'off', 'when', 'Peter', 'heads', 'Hawaii', 'where', 'same', 'hotel', 'where', 'Sarah', 'staying', 'Australian', 'rock', 'star', 'boyfriend', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'hilarious', 'More', 'importantly', 'Peter', 'hotel', 'concierge', 'Rachel', 'Mila', 'Kunis', '70s', 'Show', 'heart', 'Ms.', 'Kunis', 'darn', 'steals', 'entire', 'movie.Indeed', 'FSM', 'were', 'weaker', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Kunis', 'would', 'be', 'anyone', 'would', 'talk', 'good', 'Not', 'only', 'comic', 'timing', 'impeccable', 'depths', 'character', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'found', 'most', 'comedies', 'so', 'many', 'Apatow-ish', 'flicks', 'virtually', 'character', 'something', 'inspired', 'are', 'cardboard', 'here', 'not', 'even', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'playing', 'stoned', 'surf', 'instructor.Look', 'genuine', 'comic', 'exploration', 'heartache', 'recovery', 'not', 'mention', 'regrets', 'Ms.', 'Marshall', 'must', 'go', 'trading', 'up', 'rock', 'star', 'may', 'have', 'left', 'behind', 'most', 'special', 'guy', 'ever', 'met', 'What', 'movie', 'special', 'though', 'Ms.', 'Marshall', ""n't"", 'get', 'classic', 'come-uppance', 'la', 'so', 'many', 'teen', 'movie', 'vixens', 'instead', 'realization', 'Peter', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'darn', 'close', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'entitled', 'Peter', 'meanwhile', 'Sarah', 'good', 'points', 'got', 'more', 'share', 'baggage', 'even', 'blast', 'exposition', 'designed', 'one', 'purpose', 'show', 'lot', 'heft', 'movie', 'even', 'first', 'last', 'comedy', 'effing', 'hilarious', 'also', 'quite', 'raunchy', 'not', 'gross-out', 'way', 'Suffice', 'say', 'as', 'much', 'male', 'nudity', 'female', 'enough', 'appeal', 'taste', 'perhaps', ""grandma's.Check"", 'out', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'year']",N/A

I don't get how they could hate this film simply because he produced it.First of all, I'm not a fan of Apatow. I hated Superbad super badly (everything about that movie made me cringe; especially the not-at-all-impressive acting by nerd-typecast Michael Cera). Knocked Up was a ridiculous piece of crap--- a completely forced comedy. Step Brothers and Anchorman were awful despite the fact that I love Will Ferell. 40-Year-Old Virgin and Fun With Dick and Jane are his obviously failed attempt to attract comedy-genre lovers using big names like Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey.With that said, I love Forgetting Sarah Marshall. It is a well-written, catchy comedy that will have you laughing the entire time. The antics of each character are well honed and I think the over-all chemistry among the male characters are the funnest to watch. Sure, some of the jokes are overly sexual but to be honest, I was more focused on how disciplined were the deliveries of punchlines.

Should you wish to just see the added scenes look no further than the plethora of special features, including the Sex-O-Rama, Drunk-O-Rama and the Line-O-Rama; essentially spliced clips of the relative scenes in the film - all in 1080.The commentaries were fun as you get to see the crew/cast actually doing the sessions (PIP commentaries), but the Karaoke steals the show. Just saying the words to some of those songs makes for a fun drinking night (definitely not lyrics to do with parents/family around).The sound and picture were great, but admittedly there are not a lot of scenes to test all of the possible ranges. The flame dancing scene looked crisp, the brief water scenes looked ok, and the only glitch I encountered was trying to play the extended version as it powered down my S301 each time, but as usual the PS3 did excellent. The menu navigation can take some time as I counted over 50 different listings and sub selections to cruise through.The list seems endless as to everything you can do with this BD, including the BD Live, video diaries, gag reels, Crime Scene extras, etc., so I'll cut it short.

The guy also doesn't 'get' the girl in the end-- he gets a girl, but not the one he had been in love with. It was his choice, mostly, though, and that felt natural. In a 'regular' romcom, he would most likely get back with his old love, otherwise, the audience would feel 'frustrated'. As if!And yet, we get to actually like the character of the ex-girlfriend, Sarah Marshall. Maybe not so much as 'like', but we... 'get' her. We understand she's not a [...]. It would be so easy to make her evil so that we wouldn't like her. But life is always more complicated than that, isn't it?Sarah's new boyfriend, for example, is a 'bit' crazy, but there are positive things you can point out on him. Things don't go the easy way in the movie.Also, and maybe the most shocking for the guys, it's not the girls we see naked all the time (though there are [...] shown in the movie) - but it is our main guy, who shows his [...] a couple of times during the beginning and the end.First of all, I say 'bring it' just because it's a sort of subversion of the conventions, and with so much commonplace everywhere, i'm definitely up for that. BUT, there's intention beyond that.The first time it happens, that was precisely how he felt when his girlfriend was dumping him - unprotected, naked. When it happens again, in the end, he is naked as he prepares for a new relationship. It's come full circle. Of course, some people are way too 'distracted' to even think about any possible symbolic meaning for that.Overall, very nice movie; and given its purpose, I guess it's very sucessful.

Hoier ""thoier""","[7, 18]","I knew I was in trouble when, within 15 minutes of this film starting, I had to deal with another 'John Favreau-Swingers' type of character.  That means that we get to spend an hour and forty five minutes watching a whiny 30 year old guy mope around because his girlfriend dumped him.This would be tolerable for a high school kid, but not a 30 year old guy who they show throughout the film as being almost a 3rd wheel at his gf's premiers and red carpet events.  he doesn't like any of the clothes she buys him, either...so you never really know why he is so devastated with the breakup to begin with.  The more they flashed back to their past the more you realize what a nightmare she is....so I don't get it.But anyway, this guy decides the best way to clear his head is to go to Hawaii.  Of course, his ex is at the same hotel on the same island with her new man.  Basically, it's the same plot as any other 'comedy' about breakups and how people try to get over failed relationships.  I guess this is the structure for Comedy 101, but the filmmakers and writers here are better than that, so the entire premise is disappointing.It's way too easy to figure out what's going to happen when he checks into the hotel, has the awkward moment with his ex and...SHOCK...there's a beautiful brunette who just happens to work at the reception desk.Since everyone is comparing this to 'Knocked Up'...there is no comparison.  Everything about 'Knocked Up' was completely original and had the type of dialogue that you just didn't/don't get in American cinema.  The only thing close to it was 'There's Something About Mary'.I understand it's hard to live up to that kind of standard and virtually everything they do from here on out will be a bit of a disappointment.  However, this really was a major disappointment.  I 'chuckled' three times at three lines that may have taken up a combined :17 of film time...and when you're dealing with an hour and forty five minutes of film time, that's a lot of dead air.I think we'd be better in comparing it to another movie....Ben Stiller's 'The Heartbreak Kid' that was equally as bad.  That's a much better comparison.Hopefully I click my Kangaroo's together and wake up from the nightmare that was viewing this feature film.Just say no.",2,Will Be Forgetting Sarah Marshall In 10 Minutes,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,2275,"['knew', 'was', 'trouble', 'when', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'starting', 'had', 'deal', 'Favreau-Swingers', 'type', 'character', 'get', 'spend', 'hour', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'watching', 'whiny', '30', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'mope', 'girlfriend', 'dumped', 'him.This', 'would', 'be', 'tolerable', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'not', '30', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'show', 'film', 'being', 'almost', '3rd', 'wheel', 'gf', 'premiers', 'red', 'carpet', 'events', ""n't"", 'like', 'clothes', 'buys', 'either', 'so', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'so', 'devastated', 'breakup', 'begin', 'more', 'flashed', 'back', 'more', 'realize', 'what', 'nightmare', '.so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.But', 'anyway', 'guy', 'best', 'way', 'clear', 'head', 'go', 'Hawaii', 'course', 'ex', 'same', 'hotel', 'same', 'island', 'new', 'man', 'Basically', 'same', 'plot', 'other', ""'comedy"", 'breakups', 'how', 'people', 'try', 'get', 'over', 'failed', 'relationships', 'guess', 'structure', 'Comedy', '101', 'filmmakers', 'writers', 'here', 'are', 'better', 'entire', 'premise', 'disappointing.It', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'when', 'hotel', 'awkward', 'moment', 'ex', 'SHOCK', 'beautiful', 'brunette', 'who', 'just', 'work', 'reception', 'desk.Since', 'everyone', 'comparing', ""'Knocked"", 'Up', 'comparison', 'Everything', ""'Knocked"", 'Up', 'was', 'completely', 'original', 'had', 'type', 'dialogue', 'just', ""didn't/do"", ""n't"", 'get', 'American', 'cinema', 'only', 'thing', 'close', 'was', 'Something', ""Mary'.I"", 'understand', 'hard', 'live', 'up', 'kind', 'standard', 'virtually', 'everything', 'do', 'here', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'However', 'really', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment', ""'chuckled"", 'three', 'times', 'three', 'lines', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'combined', ':17', 'film', 'time', 'when', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'hour', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'time', 'lot', 'dead', 'air.I', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'comparing', 'movie', '.Ben', 'Stiller', ""'The"", 'Heartbreak', 'Kid', 'was', 'equally', 'bad', 'much', 'better', 'comparison.Hopefully', 'click', 'Kangaroo', 'together', 'wake', 'up', 'nightmare', 'was', 'viewing', 'feature', 'say']",N/A

1173757,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001C0JCBA,Turfseer,"[6, 13]","Forgetting Sarah Marshall chronicles the misadventures of Peter Bretter, a musician who composes music scores for TV shows. He works on a show called 'Crime Scene' (which is a satiric takeoff on shows like 'CSI'). The star of the show is a cute blonde named Sarah Marshall, who Peter has been dating for about five years. Sarah shows up one day at his apartment and announces that she's dating a rock star and their relationship is over. From the outset one wonders what Sarah sees in Peter. His apartment is a pigsty, he hates his job and it seems that his muse to create a great musical theater piece has completely left him.Peter has a stepbrother, Brian, who encourages him to start dating other women (Brian and his wife periodically pop up later in the film via a computer video link but the comic possibilities between Peter and his nutty stepbrother are never developed). Peter still can't get Sarah out of his mind so he decides to take a trip to Hawaii where Sarah liked to vacation. When he arrives at the resort hotel without a reservation, a cute brunette working at the front desk, Rachel, takes a liking to him and lets him stay at their most expensive suite for free. Meanwhile, Peter, discovers to his horror that Sarah is staying at the same hotel with her New-Age, rock star boyfriend.The first half of 'Act 2' focuses on Peter's inability to stop obsessing over the breakup of his relationship with Sarah. The main bit is Peter continually breaking down and crying whenever memories of Sarah pop up in his mind. In one particularly unfunny scene, Peter gets a call from Rachel from the front desk asking whether he can hear a woman crying in an adjacent room; of course it's Peter who's the one who's been bawling the whole time! Meanwhile, Sarah's boyfriend, Aldous Snow is an affable Brit who's avoided drinking for seven years. He invites Peter to dinner but Peter can't face Sarah with the thought that she's with someone else.At the midpoint, Peter attempts to 'forget' Sarah Marshall. He goes out on a date with Rachel who turns out to have a shady ex-boyfriend who ends up punching Peter in the face. Despite her attraction to bad boys in the past, she finds the goofy Peter amusing and attractive. Peter receives encouragement from various comic types who work at the hotel or hang out at the beach. A loony surfer instructor teaches Peter how to surf but he clumsily ends up colliding with Aldous while surfing and is knocked out cold.Peter's relationship with Rachel remains platonic. Soon Sarah is finding out that Aldous is no great catch. He announces he's going on tour and might have herpes. Before you know it, he breaks his vow of abstinence and crudely brags of sexual conquests with other women while drunk. Sarah is no longer ""into"" the boyfriend and wants to start things up with Peter again. They have a brief sexual encounter but Peter realizes he's smitten with Rachel. He confesses to her of his brief fling with Sarah to prove his 'honesty' but Rachel takes it in the wrong way and rejects him. In a last moment of desperation, he tries to prove his love to her by tearing off a topless picture of Rachel pinned on the wall of a bathroom at a local club, only to be mercilessly beaten by the bartender-owner who considers the picture his property and domain.The beating appears to wake Peter up. He goes home and starts exercising and his muse returns. He's now composing a puppet musical about Dracula. In the best scene of the film, Peter puts his comic musical on before an appreciative audience. One wonders why the Dracula musical couldn't have been developed more and featured as a main part of the plot. Rachel ends up coming to see the musical and they end up reconciling.Describing the plot of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is difficult precisely because it's so disjointed. One searches in vain for a story arc that builds to a satisfying conclusion. Rather 'Marshall' feels like a series of skits thrown together that for the most part do not pay off. And when Peter, our lovable loser hero, finally redeems himself and turns into a 'mensch' at the climax, we've spent much too much time with him as a surly 'loser'; the transformation into a good guy is undeserved as he is basically quite misanthropic until the last 15 minutes of the movie.Forgetting Sarah Marshall could have been a much better comedy. There was the potential for satire, particularly in the CSI takeoffs at the beginning and end of the film that were never developed into something really clever. The same goes for the aforementioned puppet show (the most original moment in the film). Finally, the idea that Sarah would pathetically try and rekindle her romance with Peter after everything he put her through left me feeling unsatisfied. Despite Peter's positive transformation at the end, somehow I would have liked to have seen Sarah go off on her own without feeling the need to hook back up with an ex-boyfriend who treated her so poorly during most of their relationship.",2,Loser morphs into 'Mensch' much too late,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,5004,"['Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'misadventures', 'Peter', 'Bretter',

The first time I watched this, I was definately disappointed.  I was shocked to see Jason Segel in a movie so slow and empty.  I failed to receive any of the jokes, and I turned off the T.V. not understanding the praise that this film met.Then I was subjected to a second viewing of this film.I have to say I was blown away this time around.  I caught on much more quickly with the thousands of jokes that were poured into this film.  The second most important factor, the heart of the piece, made the movie stand out loud and proud against all the horrible comedies out there.  Forgetting Sarah Marshall really has a meaningful and relatable premise to it.  All of us have been through hard break-ups and this one hits nearly everyones' soft spot.  The humor and heart carried by these great comedians make this movie a great experience.  I also invite you to check out the special features, because this disc offers a lot of extra laughs.  Once again, I will say that when you watch this film for the first time, you will miss a lot.  However, if you manage to see it again, you will unveil lots of great jokes.  In other words I'm thinking now, if they were snakes they would have bit me.  All this humor was right in front of my eyes, yet the film's flaw is its presentation of its comedy.While not a blast like its semi-sequel Get Him to the Greek, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a courageous and charming film.  It lacks in its presentation, but it makes up for it in its raw comedy underneath the barriers.

As I said the acting was not very beliveable and character development was weak.The reason for the 3 stars is the songs.  There is an awsome version of Nothing Compares to You that is sung in Hawiian.  A couple of other hit songs were done native style and that made me want to purchase the soundtrack.  Also the scenes of Hawaii were nice and inspired me to look into going there on my next vacation.All in all I was very disappointed in myself for watching the entire movie.",3,Trying to forget this movie,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,921,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'lacking', 'acting', 'was', 'ok', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'movie', 'hot', 'actress', 'dumping', 'dorky', 'nobody', 'boyfriend', 'can', 'date', 'rock', 'star', 'Guess', 'what', 'made', 'wrong', 'choice', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'out', 'trying', 'forget', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'up', 'same', 'hotel', 'staying', 'Mopey', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'see', 'happy', 'oh', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'get', 'said', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'beliveable', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'weak.The', 'reason', '3', 'stars', 'songs', 'awsome', 'version', 'Nothing', 'Compares', 'sung', 'Hawiian', 'A', 'couple', 'other', 'hit', 'songs', 'were', 'done', 'native', 'style', 'made', 'want', 'purchase', 'soundtrack', 'Also', 'scenes', 'Hawaii', 'were', 'nice', 'inspired', 'look', 'going', 'there', 'next', 'vacation.All', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'watching', 'entire', 'movie']",N/A

""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" centers on Peter [Jason Segel] who is dumped by his girlfriend of 5 yrs, Sarah [Kristen Bell of Veronica Mars]. Feeling depressed and dejected, Peter goes to Hawaii where he finds Sarah staying at the same hotel with her new boyfriend, British rockstar Aldous Snow [Russell Brand]. So, the rest of the movie basically deals with how Peter makes peace with being dumped and discovers other pleasures in life, including getting to know a warm and sensitive girl [played by That 70s Show Mila Kunis]. The four main characters share a credible on-screen chemistry, and Russell Brand in particular has great comic presence. Segel is credible in his role as the dumped BF, and Kristen Bell does a good job in her role as well. I really liked Mila Kunis' role as the warm and sensitive 'option' to Sarah. She truly lit up the screen with her genuine sensitivity to Peter's pain.
