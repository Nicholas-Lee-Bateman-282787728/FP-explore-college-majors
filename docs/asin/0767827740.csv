Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 2]","This film is one that you will either desperately hate, or you will scream your excitement to your friends at any given opportunity.  Welcome to the Dollhouse is not one that most find meddling around somewhere in the middle mainly because this is a difficult film to watch.  This is not to say that the direction is bad or the acting is atrocious, but instead its deep roots deal with issues that are difficult to swallow.  Dawn Wiener is not your typical ""hero"" in which she is redeemed at the end of the film and praised as the newest addition to the popular crowd.  There is no big entrance, there is no singing school band, in fact, there is very little of anything except the Weiner family's excitement of being on television.  We, as audience members, want to feel bad for Dawn, but we cannot just laugh her off as a comedy character.  She reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite.  While most laughed at the actions and words of Napoleon (Jared Heder), it was actually very sad the situations surrounding him.  The same can be said of Dawn.  When I talk to friends about this film they typically (after already getting excited about the discussion or denouncing the entire film) say that it was a humorous film.  Dawn is a funny character.  Even film sites label this film under the category of ""comedy"", and while there may be small elements of humor sprinkled throughout the film, I think it is far from being a ""laugh-out-loud"" comedy.  Welcome to the Dollhouse is a tragedy about society, family structures, and being the outcast that never quite fit in.Todd Solondz has single-handedly created a masterpiece that will be studied and respected for years to come in the film community.  He has taken elements so clich&eacute; in our cinema society and twisted them a bit to give us sincerity and anxiety compiled together.  His choice of both music and camera placement only further develop these intense emotions.  We want to laugh at this film, we don't want to feel sympathy for Dawn, but Solondz forces us to almost immediately.  It feels during this film that Solondz actually may have gone to school with all of us, watching our moments of embarrassment and writing them down for future reference.  I loved the sounds that Solondz used to define this film.  That wild mix of guitar and drum create a feeling that something is going to happen, thus keeping us all glued to the edge of our seats.  While Solondz obviously makes Dawn the center of this film, it is his attention to detail with the surrounding characters which really make Welcome to the Dollhouse more than you typical Hollywood fare.  I wanted to see more of Dawn's older brother; I thought he was a tight juxtaposition between Dawn and her sister, Missy.  He was also ignored by his parents, but he seemed to be comfortable with it.  He knew his role, and while he wanted to escape it, he also fit well within.  I don't believe than any actress could have pulled Dawn's mother off any better than Angela Pietropinto.  Her facial expressions and impeccable timing demonstrated to us that Dawn's pressures did not just evolve at school, but also continued at home.  I just thought that Solondz created a real family with the Wieners.  One that most films are afraid to capture on film, but seem very real to the audience.Finally, I would like to add that I believe this to be a pivotal film in our film culture.  While others may disagree, I think that Solondz has created a masterpiece.  I didn't realize this at first, and for most I will suggest more than one viewing, but the final chapter to this film is really a powerhouse of great acting, promising discovery, and a horrifying truth.  You will not end this film with butterflies and song, but instead realism, which is the honesty that Solondz bring to the table with Welcome to the Dollhouse.  The acting is a bit amateurish, but what puts a smile to my face is the ability that Solondz had to make this work.  Dawn is not an actor playing a teenage, but instead feels like a teenager playing herself.  Solondz typically uses unknown actors (in the films that really pack a wallop) which allows us to look past the acting and deeply into the story, which is why I didn't focus too much of my review on the acting.  It seemed natural, and for me I was more interested in what Solondz wanted to do, and not so much how his cast wanted to say it.  This was a Todd Solondz film.As you watch his later work, you will see Solondz evolve a bit (Happiness), and go a bit mainstream (or at least as much as he can with Storytelling), but will come back full circle giving us a match to Welcome to the Dollhouse avante-guard cinema with Palindromes.  He is a masterful director, but not one that mainstream Hollywood is willing to embrace (thankfully!).  His work, especially with this film, creates uneasiness in you that you cannot shake after watching.  He creates visions and impressions that remain with you long after the final credits have rolled, but he is an acquired taste.  Solondz is not for everyone, but for those willing to give him a chance, watch his films without the panoramic explosive eye; than I think you will find that there is nobody else like him out in our film community.  I cannot wait to see where his vision will take us next as well as I cannot wait to add Welcome to the Dollhouse to my film collection.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"Come on Dawn, tell your sister that

18922,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,0767827740,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 3]","Welcome to the Dollhouse, written, directed, and produced by Todd Solondz, is a chilling dissection of social ostracism manifested in one of society's cruelest environments, junior high school. Though the film is genuinely funny, what you notice most is the accuracy.The movie features a nuanced and brave performance by Heather Matarazzo, as Dawn, whose very being suggests that the dollhouse, a place that admits only pretty and popular girls, will forever be off limits.  Dawn is unattractive, shy, not terribly bright, physically awkward, and vilified by a world that fears what she represents; exclusion.  Her long succession of fashion crimes alone would justify banishment to Siberia.  Home is a battle zone; family, classmates, and teachers seem united against her.With characters like Dawn a surprising, positive quality usually emerges to balance the scales of justice.  So, when she sits down to play the piano, in an attempt to impress the object of her affection with the skillfulness of her hands, (she somehow believes there is sexual cachet to this although she doesn't quite know why), we desperately hope to hear Mozart played faultlessly, much to the boy's amazed delight.  No such luck.  Every social hierarchy, by definition, must have someone at the bottom, Dawn is it.The film is replete with memorable moments.  It is hard to top the bathroom scene for sheer teen sadism, or the dessert scene for familial cruelty.  We continue to care about poor Dawn throughout these vignettes because somehow, someway, she endures.  The scene when we are most in her camp, cheering for her most loudly, is the celebrated Barbie decapitation.  Massive miter saw in hand, Dawn severs the perfectly coiffed head of one of her equally perfect sister's dolls.  It says it all.  Is there any girl anywhere who has never been angered by the idea that physical beauty alone was the measure of her value?Solondz succeeds most completely when his focus is most narrow.  The third act finds him veering off into broader, murkier waters, with less success.  After treating the subject of rape lightheartedly, the emphasis moves off Heather to her too-good little ballerina sister, Missy.  Missy's abduction by a neighbor will remind viewers of the JonBenet Ramsey story, with all the queasiness that that entails.  Solondz clearly has difficulty staying on the right side of the line.  In Happiness he wandered far over it, with disastrous results, it would be hard to find a nastier or less funny movie.  What he attempted in Happiness is theoretically possible; because the more painful a subject is the greater its potential for humor, but it would take a lighter touch than his to achieve it.  In Welcome To The Dollhouse he does succeed, because he lets the pain speak for itself.  Highly recommend.

It's at turns hilarious,poignant,dark, and heartbreaking. Anyone who has been bullied can understand the daily trials of Dawn Wiener (Heather Matarazzo) called ""Wiener Dog."" Her parents don't appreciate her. They prefer her sappy,ballet-dancing younger sister. She has a crush on a rocker (Eric Mabius of ""Ugly Betty"",in an early&prescient role,Betty&Dawn are virtually twins) The beautiful people don't like Dawn. Dawn's name is ironic. She feels like she's in the Twilight Zone. Her condition is universal--the desire to love and be loved. When she gets revenge on the bullies,you cheer for her. ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" is from back in the day when art house movies weren't bleak. They were usually awash with color (see ""Desperate Remedies"" and ""But I'm a Cheerleader"") There's another layer of irony in this bittersweet cake. In ""Welcome"",Dawn is accused of being a lesbian. Last year,when gay marriage was briefly legal, Matarazzo married her longtime girlfriend. Matarazzo has moved onto smaller roles, even in the awful ""Hostel"" series.

Think her at school but without her telekinetic powers: this is Dawn, the protagonist of anti-fairy tale movie, `Wellcome To The Dollhouse"", directed by Todd Solondz .For Dawn, High School is hell. She has no friends, she is neither cute, nor popular. Everybody makes fun of her. One boy threatens to rape her, he says ""Be here at 3"", and she is there, but he is not interested in her any more. At home, things are not very different. Her parents don't care about her. They got eyes only for her little sister, who is too polite, too smart, too cute -- too hatefull -- and for her older brother, a kind of genius who is only worried about his curriculum and his stupid nerd band. Even when she falls in love, we have to addmit, she is ignored either.That is Dawn's world. And she doesn't care about it. Nor Solondz. He doesn't want to give us a lecture, saying to love everybody, even the strange girl. Moreover, his work says ""This is life, whether you like it or not!"" And this a concept that he explored much more in his lattest movies `Happiness' (1998) and `Storytelling'(2002). He has a special interest in the bizarre without making it grotesque. His films are not made to laugh out loud, they make you give pale smilles.It seems to me that the only one who have any good feeling for Dawn is the audience. It is impossible not to feel tempted to `get inside' the movie, shake her and say ""Wake up, girl! They don't like you. Forget about them."" But nobody does it. She has to move on living, despite all the limitations of her life.Who says that had never met someone like Dawn at school --or anywhere else-- is lying! She is the kind of person who is around everywhere. And almost everybody ignores them.

Recently I rented &quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse&quot;, a thoroughly fresh take on adolescent  geekdom.  The low-budget, independent feature, written and directed by Todd  Solondz, drew major attention after winning the top prize at the 1996  Sundance Film Festival.The plot revolves around the spectacularly  unpopular Dawn Wiener (well played by 12-year-old Heather Matarazzo).  Known around Benjamin Franklin Junior High as &quot;Wiener Dog&quot;, Dawn  is shunned and tormented throughout the film.  If popularity were a ladder,  Dawn would be near the botton rung.  She's not even popular in her own  family, her irritatingly cute kid sister grabbing all the attention.  I  really liked the way the film showed there are those who are even lower on  the pecking order and how Dawn, herself, is not above lobbing  insults.&quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse&quot; doesn't pretent to be  absolutely realistic.

Even some of her teachers dislike her too. When Dawn let's the teacher know Brandon is copying her answers or she tells the principal she shot a spitball in defense, because she was being bullied once again, she is the one that ends up getting in trouble, because she just can't win. She only has one friend Ralphie who is still in Elementary School, and develops a crush on Steve Rodgers. Dawn's older brothers friend who plays in a band with him. Parts in the movie like: when the popular cheerleaders ask Dawn whether she is a lesbian, The goth girl cornering Dawn in the bathroom telling her to take a crap, and her main bully, Brandon which threatens to rape her after school 2 days in a row, but turns out he is secretly in love with Dawn, for some reason made me smirk, I know it's not funny, but you just can't help it. It's sad to see that even when she runs away in search of her kidnapped younger sister, her parents still don't notice she was gone, and  at the end of the movie her classmates all yell ""Wienerdog"" in unison while she is standing in the podium of the school auditorium giving a speech of gratitude for having Missy back home again. No Dawn does not become popular at the end, everyone in school still hates her, and her parents still love Missy more than her.

18932,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767827740,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[9, 10]","Bold, unabashedly honest, psychologically riveting, and painfully mesmerizing are just a few of the words and expressions that come to mind when I think about this uniquely extraordinary film.  First shown at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival, Welcome to the Dollhouse walked away with the grand jury prize, and it is easy to see why.  Writer/director/producer Todd Solondz brought a unique vision of the sharpest kind to this film, cutting right through the fluff of the typical &quot;geek makes good&quot; nonsense and forcing his artistic scalpel forcefully down into the nethermost regions of the adolescent heart.  The story is so unsettling and painfully uncomfortable that some parents hesitated or refused to let their children participate in the filming.  It's just an amazing, unforgettable movie.Eleven-year-old Heather Matarrazzo gives one of the most remarkable performances I've ever seen from an actress of such tender age.  Her eyes and bodily expressions encapsulate and transmit the hurt and misery writhing inside her every moment, leaving the viewer helpless to do anything but watch with increasingly unrestrained unease.  Born with the unfortunate name of Dawn Weiner, the poor girl is ridiculed, ignored, teased, insulted, and basically mentally terrorized every day at school.  Chants of &quot;Weiner Dog&quot; follow her throughout the hallways, her locker is marked with awful graffiti, and even her teachers and administrators are less than kind to her.  Then, after school, she has to come home to parents who dote on her smart older brother and &quot;little miss perfect&quot; younger sister.  Dawn has only one friend, a younger neighbor boy who seems to be following in her ignominiously alienated footsteps.  Dawn does not escape all of this mentally unscathed, taking her own anger out on her sister in particular and doing several things that good girls should not do.  In the most surreal of story elements, Dawn longs to be rescued from her situation by a boy, but hers is not a Cinderella type of fantasy.  Her infatuation with a rebellious high school boy is somewhat understandable, but her relationship with a certain school bully is nothing short of surreal.  I only wish I could discuss the psychology of this aspect of the movie in this context.The one thing that really struck me about this movie is the fact that we never see Dawn cry; she internalizes all of her torments, and this does not have a pretty effect on her.  I may be inventing a phrase here, but the director's vision seems to me to have been one of unsympathetic compassion.  Far from holding Dawn up as the paragon of innocent, unrecognized virtue whose Prince Charming will come some day, he gives us a girl who becomes cruel in her own right to those few people around her, turning her hatred of others into a deep hatred of herself, several times teetering on the peak of mental unbalance.  Solondz does not stray anywhere near the realm of fairy tale, as this ugly duckling does have an ugly side to her.  The brutal honesty and lack of a visibly sympathetic portrayal of the character makes her worst moments even more unbearable to the viewer, and this is where the compassion kicks in.  Solondz seemingly makes no effort to redeem this character in our eyes, yet the fact that he shows us, in such a harsh and brutal way, the miseries of this poor child's life makes her a character you desperately want to see find a degree of happiness.The only thing I don't really understand about Welcome to the Dollhouse is the dark comedy label it seems to have acquired.  I found nothing funny whatsoever about anything I saw here.  Maybe that's the sensitivity of the former nerd in me, but honestly this movie is just utterly dark and depressing.  Those looking for laughs will probably not embrace Welcome to the Dollhouse, but those who want to see the harsh light of truth shone into the bottom of an individual's soul and learn something from the painful experience will walk away from this film a different person than they were an hour and a half earlier.

In this film, director Todd Solondz stacks the deck against Dawn Wiener (the perfect last name) and starts to peel away the skin of all the characters in the film.  This process of discovery, excruciatingly honest at times, feels like sandpaper chafing your entire body.  Throughout the story we experience the Romantic life of an unloved girl, placed at odds against the entire world around her.  Her desperate search exposes the need and lack of love in all of these character's lives, while at the same time providing an entertaining ride._Welcome to the Dollhouse_ rollercoasters back and forth between very different genres and it becomes hard to classify and digest.  At times, I was shocked and absolutely appauled/depressed by the horrible circumstances that surrounded Dawn (played wonderfully by Heather Matarazzo); the next minute, however, you cannot stop laughing at the horrendously awkwardness of life's situations.  In particular, the callous treatment Dawn receives at the hand of her family is so awful (and, yet, so honest to real life) that everyone watching the film was in tears at several points.  In fact, that is a good trademark of the film: it contains, between its touching characters and shocking honesty, the ability to evoke tears of sympathy as well as humor.While you may not wish to sit through _Welcome to the Dollhouse_ more than once due to its rigid and coarse depiction of our past, it is a wonderful film that ranks well above most of the films I see these days.

18936,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767827740,Dennis Littrell,"[105, 112]","BEWARE SPOILERS!This is a very funny comedy about the indomitable spirit of an 11-year-old junior high school girl, Dawn Wiener, played with geekish verve by Heather Matarazzo, who overcomes real life horrors the likes of which would make war heroes shutter.  How would you like to be courted by a guy whose pick up line is ""I'm going to rape you at three o'clock.  Be there.""?  Or have a mother who splits your chocolate cake in front of your watering eyes into two pieces and adds them to the plates of your brother and sister?  Or have your dream lover tell you he can't be a member of your Special People Club because it's ""a club for retards""?It gets worse.  You're taunted daily by choruses of ""Wiener Dog!"" and ""Lesbo freak!"" and bullied at school by everybody including some teachers and the principal.  And at home, your siblings tear down your club house.  And when you're missing from home for a day and phone home, you're told to call back later, mom and your spoiled little sister are mugging for the TV cameras.Ah, but Dawn can overcome the night.  She turns the would-be rapist into a macho-posturing little boy who really only wants to be affectionate (""I make the first move!"" he boasts) and demonstrates that no matter how hard they hit her, she'll be back tomorrow, undaunted.Matarazzo does a great job, but she isn't alone.  Brenden Sexton stands out as the posturing macho boy who loves her but can't admit it, as does Eric Mabius playing Steve Rogers, the self-absorbed high schooler/rock star wanna be (and Dawn's first love).  The rest of the cast is also good, especially Victoria Davis in a bit part as the foul-mouthed, sexually ambiguous 12-year-old Lolita who corners Dawn in the bathroom.  Incidentally that scene in which Lolita slyly tells Dawn ""You didn't come in here to wash your hands,"" and insists that she do what she intended to do is just a great piece of pre adolescent camp.  Another fine (and subtle) scene is when Dawn in her bedroom hears Steve Rogers sing for the first time (in the garage with her brother's ""band"").  The expression on her face, as she rises up enthralled and follows the sound, suggests someone in the throes of a first awakening.  And I loved the bit where Dawn, after being told by one of Steve Rogers's ex-girl friends that they ""finger-...(you-know-what)"" one night and that was all, is inspired to demonstrate her finger work on the piano to Steve and then to show him her hands, fingers spread so he can see them.  Of course he hasn't a clue to what she's thinking--and we're not too sure either!Now some people may think there is some exaggeration here, and they're right.  I mean, nobody wears a pirate's black eye patch after getting hit in the eye with a spit ball!  And teachers, even bad ones, know better than to deliberately humiliate their students (although some do it unconsciously).  Nonetheless, while the action may not be entirely realistic at times, its spirit is totally true.  Just ask anybody who remembers junior high school.  Which brings me to the question: how did director and script writer, Todd Solondz, get it so right?  Did he take notes when he was still in junior high to use when he grew up?  Did he steal his daughter's diary?  Clearly somebody lived this script.  I'm guessing that ""Dawn"" is ""Todd"" at least in spirit, and the striking capture of the psychology of the world of being twelve-years-old is due to his having been there and done that, ""big time,"" as is written on Dawn's locker.Whatever, this full color world of the middle child is an adorable, witty, psychologically honest, beautifully directed and edited, masterfully conceived entertainment, winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, 1996, and sure to steal your heart.Final irony: this is a movie for and about 12-year-olds (it would appear) yet it is rated ""R"" and so, in effect, junior high school life is not only ""not suitable"" for those under thirteen, they can't even view it!--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",5,I even liked the song,1005264000,"11 9, 2001",2001,4055,"['BEWARE', 'SPOILERS', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'indomitable', 'spirit', '11-year-old', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'Dawn', 'Wiener', 'played', 'geekish', 'verve', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'horrors', 'likes', 'would', 'make', 'war', 'heroes', 'shutter', 'How', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'courted', 'guy', 'pick', 'up', 'line', ""'m"", 'going', 'rape', 'three', ""o'clock"", 'Be', 'there.', 'have', 'mother', 'who', 'chocolate', 'cake', 'front', 'watering', 'eyes', 'two', 'pieces', 'plates', 'brother', 'sister', 'have', 'dream', 'lover', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'member', 'Special', 'People', 'Club', 'club', 'retards', 'worse', ""'re"", 'taunted', 'daily', 'choruses', 'Wiener', 'Dog', 'Lesbo', 'freak', 'bullied', 'school', 'everybody', 'including', 'teachers', 'principal', 'home', 'siblings', 'tear', 'down', 'club', 'house', 'when', ""'re"", 'missing', 'home', 'day', 'phone', 'home', ""'re"", 'told', 'call', 'back', 'later', 'mom', 'spoiled', 'little', 'sister', 'are', 'mugging', 'TV', 'cameras.Ah', 'Dawn', 'can', 'overcome', 'night', 'would-be', 'rapist', 'macho-posturing', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'really', 'only', 'be', 'affectionate', 'make', 'first', 'move', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'hit', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'tomorrow', 'undaunted.Matarazzo', 'great', 'job', ""n't"", 'alone', 'Brenden', 'Sexton', 'out', 'posturing', 'macho', 'boy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'admit', 'Eric', 'Mabius', 'playing', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'self-absorbed', 'high', 'schooler/rock', 'star', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'Dawn', 'first', 'love', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'good', 'especially', 'Victoria', 'Davis', 'bit', 'part', 'foul-mouthed', 'sexually', 'ambiguous', '12-year-old', 'Lolita', 'who', 'Dawn', 'bathroom', 'Incidentally', 'scene', 'Lolita', 'slyly', 'tells', 'Dawn', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'here', 'wash', 'hands', 'do', 'what', 'intended', 'do', 'just', 'great', 'piece', 'pre', 'adolescent', 'camp', 'fine', 'subtle', 'scene', 'when', 'Dawn', 'bedroom', 'hears', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'sing', 'first', 'time', 'garage', 'brother', 'band', 'expression', 'face', 'up', 'enthralled', 'sound', 'someone', 'throes', 'first', 'awakening', 'loved', 'bit', 'where', 'Dawn', 'being', 'told', 'one', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'ex-girl', 'friends', 'finger-', 'one', 'night', 'was', 'inspired', 'demonstrate', 'finger', 'work', 'piano', 'Steve', 'then', 'show', 'hands', 'fingers', 'spread', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'course', ""n't"", 'clue', 'what', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'Now', 'people', 'may', 'think', 'exaggeration', 'here', ""'re"", 'right', 'mean', 'nobody', 'pirate', 'black', 'eye', 'patch', 'getting', 'hit', 'eye', 'spit', 'ball', 'teachers', 'even', 'bad', 'ones', 'know', 'better', 'deliberately', 'humiliate', 'students', 'do', 'unconsciously', 'Nonetheless', 'action', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'realistic', 'times', 'spirit', 'totally', 'true', 'Just', 'ask', 'anybody', 'who', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'Which', 'question', 'how', 'did', 'director', 'script', 'writer', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'get', 'so', 'right', 'Did', 'take', 'notes', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'junior', 'high', 'use', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'Did', 'steal', 'daughter', 'diary', 'Clearly', 'somebody', 'lived', 'script', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Dawn', 'Todd', 'least', 'spirit', 'striking', 'capture', 'psychology', 'world', 'being', 'twelve-years-old', 'due', 'having', 'been', 'done', 'big', 'time', 'written', 'Dawn', 'locker.Whatever', 'full', 'color', 'world', 'middle', 'child', 'adorable', 'witty', 'psychologically', 'honest', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'edited', 'masterfully', 'conceived', 'entertainment', 'winner', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Sundance', '1996', 'sure', 'steal', 'heart.Final', 'irony', 'movie', '12-year-olds', 'would', 'appear', 'yet', 'rated', 'R', 'so', 'effect', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'suitable', 'thirteen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'view', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",N/A

Set in a New Jersey suburb and its equally soul-killing junior high school, it's a mix of Byron's hostile universe and Kafka's vision of a world so absurdly and inexplicably cruel as to be both surreal and comic.Hapless Dawn Wiener, who is routinely tormented by classmates not only for her name but her homely looks, glasses and clothing among other things, also has to come home to a classic dysfunctional middle class family whose parents dote on her younger sister and her older Bill-Gates-lookalike brother who's obsessed with getting into a good college.  The slings and arrows come from all directions and at all times, though there is a surprising romantic development between Dawn and one of her schoolyard tormentors.Like almost all of Solondz's work, there are no clear cut good and bad characters here, just REAL characters---all of them to a greater or lesser degree are self-absorbed freaks and none of them are blameless or innocent.  In short, if you are the kind of viewer who HAS to find a ""good"" character to latch on to and identify with in order to watch a film, you will probably hate this film.It abounds with humor so black and sharp and merciless you don't know whether to cry or laugh.

I had seen his second film HAPPINESS and was intrigued by Solondz dark dark humor.  Why it took me so long to take in another of his films is hard to explain.  Every review I had read of DOLLHOUSE praised it (and even some reviewers who literally hated HAPPINESS were oddly touched by this debut film).  Perhaps it took me a year or so to summon up enough strength to take another Solondz flick.  Now that I think about it, such hesitancy only seems natural.  As it turns out, however, biting as it is, DOLLHOUSE is still a heck of a lot easier to watch than its follow-up.Perhaps it's because as some reviewers here suggest, we all have our own &quot;inner Dawn Wiener.&quot;  It's easy to identify with this ungainly, hopelessly unpopular teenager--with the awful barrettes and clothes, a brainy older brother, and pertly adorable younger sister.  We can all cop to that one pretty much.  (If you identify at all with the characters in HAPPINESS, you probably wouldn't want to admit it.)  But I honestly don't think that Solondz' intent was to get viewers in touch with their &quot;inner adolescent.&quot;  He's going after something bigger than that--and more sinister too.I guess it shouldn't be so surprising that many reviewers here identify with Dawn, but when they start calling the film &quot;realistic,&quot; you have to wonder.  If there was ever a film that was an exercise in pop SURrealism, this is it.As a teen alienation flick, I'd rate it right up there with GHOST WORLD, and like that film, it has a distorted, fun-house-mirror quality--that is, I'll grant you, simultaneously more and less real that mere realism.  (I guess that's the essence of SURREALISM).  Dawn's parents, for example, are little more than cartoon figures--at least until her father has a near nervous breakdown.And doesn't that reflect a teenage sense of reality even better than sheer realism, after all?  Your average teen doesn't see his or her parents as full-fledged human beings.  They're way too busy with their own boiling over emotions. Until their parents humanity hits them in the face, kids see them through the looking glass, darkly--if at all.Which is not to say that either of Dawn's parents becomes remotely sympathetic.  Interesting too how in the end, Dawn's two almost-boyfriends have run away to the city.  Dawn kinda sorta runs away herself trying to track downr her kidnapped little sister.

The movies strength lies in it's sarcasm. It is serious, but it doesn't take itself seriously. If junior high bit you, this movie bites back. You are forced to admire the courage with which the character's face every day of their misunderstood lives.The protagonist of this movie, named Dawn Wiener (they call her wienerdog) is shy, softspoken and awkward, with a odd mismatching retro style of dressing and big wiry glasses. Therefore, she is labeled a loser. Like all junior high school kids she wants to be popular. Despite the movie's various character, the focus never really shifts from Dawn.Enter Steve, the most popular guy in the high school. He is forced into playing in Dawn's brother's (also a nerd) band in return for tutoring in math class. Dawn decides that she is in love with him and tries various hilarious strategies to win him over.The best thing about this movie is it's dark look at average suburban life. Yes, maybe you can be average, safe and live in a house with a white picket fence, but the pecking order still exists. Alienation exists everywhere.The theme song is perhaps the best part of an exceptional movie. It expresses the bitter and sometimes painful experience of suburban life, junior high, and being an outcast anywhere. At the end, the movie leaves you with one hard luck comforting message.

I just watched this movie last night, and it may very well be my favorite film ever. Sometimes art is truer than fact, and ""Dollhouse"", while certainly not factual, rings very, very true.Is this film awful? Yes. Is it cruel? Yes. Is it hopeless? Yes. Is it brilliant and funny and bizarrely resassuring? Yes. Reading the other reviews here, I'm a little worried I'm the meanest person alive, because I thought this movie was incredibly funny. I laughed so hard my stomach hurt. Dawn's suffering, and the suffering she inflicts on others, is completely unacceptable, yet it happens every day. What can you do besides laugh? Crying won't do any good either.As much as I loved it, ""Dollhouse"" is definitely not for everyone. Here is a hypothetical question: is there some tiny part of you that finds the thought of a nerdy girl murdering her darling little sister with a hammer funny? No? Then stay far away from this film.I hestitate to cover the actual details of the plot, first because they've been covered extensively already, and second because I think you should go into this movie cold if at all possible. In fact, stop reading this review and go see the movie immediately.Still here? Okay. I will say that I sympathized with Dawn's sister, as much as I also sympathized with Dawn's dislike. Solondz is both gentle and merciless with his characters. You aren't protected from anyone's ugly moments, but at the same time, you know that they are doing their best, and you might very well do the same thing in their position.The film, while almost totally without hope, still manages to be oddly reassuring. You can definitely see why Dawn is an outcast - she wears huge glasses with clothes a thrift shop would turn its nose up at, and has an overbite the size of Alaska. But at the same time, you can see that she's not ugly or worthless, the way adolescents often feel they are (and are often told they are). She just hasn't grown into herself yet.I also strongly identified how surreal and adrift Dawn's experience was. Her peers are cruel beyond all reason (and yet, it's happening), and the adults don't have the faintest idea what's going on, even when she tries to enlist their help. The movie is completely unpredictable, which adds to the sense of rudderlessness. Dawn more or less takes everything in stride because anything, no matter how good or bad, seems possible. Becoming popular? Rape? DisneyWorld? It doesn't matter that it doesn't make sense, she is still living it.The ending is awful, but unfortunately very true. That's all I'm going to say.

Though not on the 'level' of Dawn in my junior high experience, I was definatly down there, attracting negativity like a fly to flypaper--and like Dawn, most of  it was perpetuated by my own confusions and secret desires for attention  and relationships no matter the destructive end.And that, to me, is what  'Welcome to the Dollhouse' is all about: relationships, or the lack thereof  in Dawn's life.  It is easy to draw all sorts of parallels from this movie  (this 'fantasy') into the real world.  Where to begin? In her family, the  father is barely present, the mother is domineering and dotes on the  'perfect' sister, and the brother has, to say the least, a one-track mind  concerning education. Dawn is the freak, the sore thumb, the blot on this  suburbian portrait, as so excellently pointed out in the opening scene.  Starved for contact, Dawn lusts after the town pedophile and is turned on  by the school bully who threatens to rape her (this sounds horrific, but  the moments of these two on screen are among the most poignant and subtly  effective of any acting at any age).  Dawn's best friend adores her like a  puppy and of course is spurned for such devotion.  Whoever made this film  creates a startling statement about what we want and what we  attract.Best of all is the ending, which I will not spoil, but it was a  great relief that 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' didn't end up a happy  Hollywood cop-out.Watch the last scene.

Both have the cast decked out in hideous wardrobes with horrid 1970's-looking environments. Both are about high-school oddballs who face torment from the shallow popular kids. But while Napoleon Dynamite is rather light-hearted, WTTD is really dark and will make you cringe with guilt and quite often make you feel really uncomfortable. In fact, it has more in common with a true horror movie than it does a dark comedy.Heather Matarazzazzazzo plays the unfortunately surnamed Dawn Weiner, a girl blessed with strange looks (meh-I like her) and an uncaring ignorant family. E-ver-y-one around her is UN-BEE-LEEV-ABLY cruel to her in every way possible. And rage unconfronted continues forever. As are her bullies bullied themselves, Dawn goes on to bully others etc. It subtle idiosyncrasies like this that might go unnoticed in single viewings.Other characters are quite well drawn, especially Brandon, who didn't get enough screen time. His relationship with Dawn is quite intriguing. Most would think he's using her as a way of making himself feel better but when you think about it that's probably not entirely true. Perhaps Brandon likes Dawn because she isn't nasty to him like Cookie and the other girls were. She wasn't tarting all over him like Lolita in the library and she stood up to Brandon for punching Troy. Also Brandon apologises to her for vandalising her locker and the sad looks he gives her in the library appear to be a look of longing and wanting.Ironically, the biggest monster in the film is Dawn's own mother. She's a beast of a woman, completely ignorant of Dawn's needs and infatuated with her other younger daughter and far too supportive of her arrogant older brother (his character is further developed in Todd Solondz's 2004 movie Palindromes, played by the same actor). Any scene with her will make you grit your teeth and shake your head no doubt.Too bad Heather Matarazzazzazzo is married (err...to another woman-sigh...no chance for me now) cause she's actually quite attractive in real life. Though I must say again her wardrobe in this film is 'EEK' Seriously, you'll be questioning Dawn's fashion sense. But then she's probably only wearing what her mother buys for her and wants her to be seen in.If this movie impresses you then I dare you to check out Todd Solondz's follow-up Happiness. Now THERE is a film to dark and so unbelievably horrifying you'll be watching it through the gaps between your fingers and biting your lip in an effort to restrain the guilty laughter. But on it's own, WTTD is a great movie. Just don't show it to kids if your not down with frank portrayal of teen sexuality or bad language. Or do show them as a lesson in how NOT to treat people.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 2.0 sound.

We're introduce to Dawn Wiener (Heather Matarazzo), an awkward seventh grader who is put down by her peers because of her physical appearance. The taunting Dawn endures is extreme and does not come across as even slightly reminiscent of anything that happened in my high school, but this fact does not take away from the empathy we feel for her as she struggles through her daily life. As if school weren't bad enough, Dawn's home life doesn't leave much to be desired. Her older brother Mark (Matthew Faber), is the ""king of the geeks"". Her parents offer no support either. Dawn's other sibling, Missy (Daria Kalinina), is the darling of the family who can do no wrong. She simply flits around the house in her pink tu-tu and makes Dawn's life look hellish by comparison.Dawn's life is further complicated by Brandon McCarthy (Brendan Sexton Jr.), the misunderstood juvenile who has taken a liking to her. At the beginning of their ""relationship"" he tells her he will rape her. This does not happen because of various circumstances, but Dawn ends up falling for this tough guy and eventually losing him when he runs away. Throughout the movie, it appears as if everyone in her life pours their derision upon anything she does, exposing all her weaknesses however carefully they might be hidden. Dawn, in turn, passes this on to the few people that she gets close to.This was not a realistic depiction of the hells of junior high school. For one thing, girls would pick on other girls, but in no way, whatsoever, would any of them force another to sit on the crapper in front of another as a forms of bullying. These are 11-12 year olds? Uh uh. Maybe 4 years older that would happen, but no one at that age would succumb to a type of humiliation that gross and tasteless.Our lead character is played brilliantly, and shows her determination in the face of endless adversity - in fact, the acting all around is excellent. But the movie denies the moments of redemption. Such a strong young warrior as Dawn would certainly have had some triumphs to share.

18966,A5GIYITYJPWN1,0767827740,"L P ""lilip""","[3, 3]","This movie is about a girl in junior high who is as unpopular as can be. Everyone spits on her, from her school mates, to her teachers, her siblings and even her own parents. Every adult in this movie is an ugly human being and Dawn is caught amidst this ugliness, becoming one of its unfortunate victims.If at the age of 12/13 you werent part of the popular in-crowd filled with perfect little miss sunshines, then you will appreciate what Dawn is going through. No one likes her; in fact, everyone hates her. When she asks one of her tormentors why she hates her so much, she responds ""because you are ugly"". That pretty much sums it all up, as all the people in Dawn's life are mean to her and flat out a_*oles for no apparent reason. Her mother, her father, her brother, her teachers, her peers -  and even her little sister whom I hated so much that in fact when she was kidnapped in the end I was actually hoping they had hurt her. Seeing a mere 7 year old be so mean already doesnt leave much hope for the rest of us. Everyone, without exception, is mean and cruel to Dawn.I would not call this movie a comedy or particularly funny. It is actually filled with social commentary, is sad and while humorous at times, it is depressing to watch Dawn be surrounded by so much hatred and dislike and lack of love in her life. No wonder she is mean to those weaker than her, the girl doesnt know anything else. All the adults in her life are despicable human beings presenting some of the worst qualities, so she cant give what she never received. There is one scene, after her sister has been kidnapped, where she tells her brother that their mom doesnt want her to go to school today because she is afraid she might be kidnapped too, and her brother responds deridingly ""yeah right""; exemplifying how worthless Dawn is made feel as her own brother doesnt think she is worth kidnapping.Welcome to the Dollhouse is a powerful movie; it is brutally honest and it will not sugercoat junior high and the being an unpopular and emotionally-abused 12 year-old experience for you. The sad thing about it is, of course, that people really are like that in life. I could identify with Dawn in so many ways. When I was 12, I was wearing huge glasses and dorky clothes and didnt fit in and just wasnt popular at all and people in my school, including my teachers, made me feel worthless. I remember that one time when i was wearing a jacket with a big hood and this kid behind me in line slowly dumped his yogurt, spoon by spoon, into my hood. I guess director/writer Todd Solondaz must have gone through similar humiliating experiences, which is why he was able to retell Dawn's plight in such painful accuracy.The ending is pretty strong as well because it is not a sappy, stupidm Hollywood ending, but a real-life one. The character, unlike the characters of many of the high school classics of the 80s that unduly idolize the school years -  such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club and Can't Buy Me Love etc. - doesnt come out of age, or grows as a person, is now popular or suddenly finds the love of her life. Nothing really is resolved. Her parents still treat her like dirt and mostly ignore her, she still doesnt have any friends or gained popularity of any kind. A lot of people complain about the ending, stating that it has no resolution and that her circumstances dont change, BUT THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. As Thoreau once said  ""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation"". Their plights  go unnoticed and then they die. Most people who are treated  like Dawn dont become either a) happy, pretty, successful, fit, loved, tanned people or b) turn to a life of crime becoming the Columbine shooters.

Without the looks or personality to be popular, she is picked on mercilessly by students and teachers alike. Things aren't any better at home either - her parents obviously play favourites, her perfect adorable wannabe-ballerina sister Missy is loved by everyone and her older brother Mark thinks only of getting into a good college (telling Dawn that she might as well go to Disney World because it would look good on her college resume). Her only real friend and sole member of Dawn's 'Special People Club' is a boy named Ralphie, smaller than she is and nicknamed ""faggot"".The movie deals with Dawn's huge crush, on the high school heart throb who is currently lead singer in her brother's band, realistically. He's fairly indifferent to her. If he notices her, he's kind to her in a distant sort of way. Most of the time he hardly sees her.

Everything about this movie screams ""90s"" from the grunge esque wardrobe of many of the boys, to the outdated clunky computers. Even though most people don't go through with what Dawn did, I think most people can still relate a little bit to Dawn in some way. Especially if you were 'uncool' or felt hopelessly awkward. I myself, was (and still is) extremely shy, and this made it difficult for me to communicate and understand most of the kids at my school. This movie is basically a bittersweet comedy, it's funny at the same time it is hopelessly depressing. Maybe it's so depressing because it rings so true to life, as most of us don't want to face the reality of our adolescent years. We let Hollywood dictate what we think happened, as presented to us in movies like 'American Pie' and 'She's All That' so we end up thinking, ""Oh that wasn't so bad afterall, was it?"" One interesting thing about Welcome to the Dollhouse is it seems to explore why certain people act the way they do. Take the two main characters for instance. Why do bullies like Brandon act the way they do? Is it because they come from a broken family and they weren't shown enough love and affection? Why exactly did he act so extremely cruel to Dawn, but also acted like he had nice intentions? Dawn's character could be another mystery to people. After she first got away from being 'raped' why did she suddenly go back the next time and act so submissive? Is a part of her a bit of a masochist due to the way she is treated at school? Or is it because she feels so lonely herself, and just wants to feel wanted, even if it is in the most horrible way possible? It's a movie that kids can relate to, but I don't think until you're older can you ever really 'get it'.

18977,A10X0JN8KTK89H,0767827740,ninjasuperstar,"[5, 6]","Welcome to the DollhouseI watched this film with some discomfort.  A flood of memories rushed forth: A bigger kid straining his neck to lock eyes with me just to say, ""You're ugly""; random hands pushing me or knocking heavy books from my weak grasp; and high school kids on mopeds pursuing me as I pedaled my bike as fast as I could.  They would later pretend to drown me in the public swimming pool the following summer.I also recall my poignant retaliation: ""Hi, f&%ckers!"" I once yelled to the moped kids.  Playing dodge ball in P.E. class, I pegged a huge football player right in the face, and the sound echoed loudly throughout the gym.  A much larger kid who wanted to fight me backed down.  From then on, no one ever picked on me again.  It was like other boys and eventually other men could smell it on me: Don't mess with this guy.Welcome to the Dollhouse is like a therapy session for experiences you thought you had long forgotten.  As I've become an adult, something has ruined my view of pre-teens and teenagers.  I can't always individualize them.  Sometimes, I tend to lump them together into self-centered, easily manipulated materialist automatons.  After viewing this film, my empathy for them has returned.When discussing this film, there's a danger in making it sound like a horrible experience: Who wants to relive junior high?  It was terrible the first time around, and this couldn't be better captured than with the painful image (and sound) of utter isolation at the end of the film.  But I would not be doing justice to the film if I left it described as an accurate depiction of teenage cruelty.  Like Todd Solondz's other films, Welcome to the Dollhouse is funny and entertaining as well as dark.Heather Matarazzo's performance as Dawn Weiner perfectly captures everything that is geeky and awkward about being twelve years old.  Very likely, she will remind you of yourself at that age, or, if not, at least someone you knew back then.  There must be a Dawn Weiner in every sixth grade classroom in the world.Some scenes in the movie are filmed beautifully, as when Dawn plays the piano for an older high school boy with whom she is infatuated.  Other scenes are blown over the top, mostly for comedy relief.  The overuse of one of the music pieces (you'll know when you hear it for the fifth time) grated on my nerves a bit, but the music overall is carefully selected to keep the balance of humor and darkness genuine and consistent.Unlike most other movies about pre-teens and teenagers, Welcome to the Dollhouse reflects how kids actually talk to one another.  They experiment with different ways of cursing and ridiculing each other and threaten bodily harm and sexual assault...but I swear the movie is funny.  I found the humor in Welcome to the Dollhouse more attached to reality than the humor in Napoleon Dynamite.  Napoleon Dynamite celebrates the geek and the nerd, but Welcome to the Dollhouse knows that such fantasies are ultimately untrue.I have no idea why this movie is rated R.  Clearly, it's meant for the PG-13 crowd, yet for some reason their experiences, rarified in a cinematic narrative, are too much for them to handle.I've described the darkness, but I'm not able to explain how darkness is funny.  One can't explain to anyone a sense of humor they don't already share on some level.  You might be shocked, uncomfortable (as I was initially), disgusted, but you'll know that the film is real, and like all good dark comedies, Welcome to the Dollhouse asks the viewer to make a decision about the awkward turns in life: Is this painful experience a tragedy?  Is it a comedy?  How will it affect me?  How shall I proceed?",4,Welcome to the origins of the awkward - 4.5 stars,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,3676,"['Welcome', 'DollhouseI', 'watched', 'film', 'discomfort', 'flood', 'memories', 'rushed', 'forth', 'bigger', 'kid', 'straining', 'neck', 'lock', 'eyes', 'just', 'say', ""'re"", 'ugly', 'random', 'hands', 'pushing', 'knocking', 'heavy', 'books', 'weak', 'grasp', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'mopeds', 'pursuing', 'pedaled', 'bike', 'as', 'fast', 'could', 'would', 'later', 'pretend', 'drown', 'public', 'swimming', 'pool', 'following', 'summer.I', 'also', 'recall', 'poignant', 'retaliation', 'Hi', 'f', '%', 'ckers', 'once', 'yelled', 'moped', 'kids', 'Playing', 'dodge', 'ball', 'P.E', 'class', 'pegged', 'huge', 'football', 'player', 'right', 'face', 'sound', 'echoed', 'loudly', 'gym', 'much', 'larger', 'kid', 'who', 'wanted', 'fight', 'backed', 'down', 'then', 'one', 'ever', 'picked', 'again', 'was', 'other', 'boys', 'eventually', 'other', 'men', 'could', 'smell', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'guy.Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'therapy', 'session', 'experiences', 'thought', 'had', 'long', 'forgotten', ""'ve"", 'become', 'adult', 'something', 'ruined', 'view', 'pre-teens', 'teenagers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'individualize', 'Sometimes', 'tend', 'lump', 'together', 'self-centered', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'materialist', 'automatons', 'viewing', 'film', 'empathy', 'returned.When', 'discussing', 'film', 'danger', 'making', 'sound', 'horrible', 'experience', 'Who', 'relive', 'junior', 'high', 'was', 'terrible', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'captured', 'painful', 'image', 'sound', 'utter', 'isolation', 'end', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'doing', 'justice', 'film', 'left', 'described', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'teenage', 'cruelty', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'other', 'films', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'dark.Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'performance', 'Dawn', 'Weiner', 'perfectly', 'everything', 'geeky', 'awkward', 'being', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'Very', 'likely', 'will', 'remind', 'age', 'not', 'least', 'someone', 'knew', 'back', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'Dawn', 'Weiner', 'sixth', 'grade', 'classroom', 'world.Some', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'when', 'Dawn', 'piano', 'older', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'whom', 'infatuated', 'Other', 'scenes', 'are', 'blown', 'top', 'mostly', 'comedy', 'relief', 'overuse', 'one', 'music', 'pieces', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'hear', 'fifth', 'time', 'grated', 'nerves', 'bit', 'music', 'overall', 'carefully', 'selected', 'keep', 'balance', 'humor', 'darkness', 'genuine', 'consistent.Unlike', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'pre-teens', 'teenagers', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'how', 'kids', 'actually', 'talk', 'one', 'experiment', 'different', 'ways', 'cursing', 'ridiculing', 'other', 'threaten', 'bodily', 'harm', 'sexual', 'assault', 'swear', 'movie', 'funny', 'found', 'humor', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'more', 'attached', 'reality', 'humor', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'geek', 'nerd', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'such', 'fantasies', 'are', 'ultimately', 'untrue.I', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'movie', 'rated', 'R.', 'Clearly', 'meant', 'PG-13', 'crowd', 'yet', 'reason', 'experiences', 'rarified', 'cinematic', 'narrative', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'handle.I', ""'ve"", 'described', 'darkness', ""'m"", 'not', 'able', 'explain', 'how', 'darkness', 'funny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'anyone', 'sense', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'share', 'level', 'might', 'be', 'shocked', 'uncomfortable', 'was', 'initially', 'disgusted', ""'ll"", 'know', 'film', 'real', 'good', 'dark', 'comedies', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'viewer', 'make', 'decision', 'awkward', 'life', 'painful', 'experience', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'How', 'will', 'affect', 'How', 'shall', 'proceed']",N/A

18981,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,0767827740,Only-A-Child,"[10, 10]","""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" is basically a feature length episode of ""Freaks and Geeks"", with an amped-up rejection level and consequently an even more alienated main character (Dawn Wiener played by Heather Matarazzo). Then throw in a little of the ""Jan Brady"" middle child syndrome and give the thing a ""Napoleon Dynamite"" production design. What makes ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" so extraordinary is that it is more about what is happening inside each viewer as they watch the film than about what is actually happening on the screen. Meaning that your reaction and the film's entertainment value will have a lot to do with your own experiences at that age or at least your sympathetic awareness of the difficulties that some of your classmates were experiencing. As someone has already said, if you aren't blown away by how realistic this is then you weren't unpopular enough.While Dawn's 7th grade world and home life are surreal extremes which give the film a nice level of black comedy (the stuff written on her locker is hilarious), even the most extreme of these elements ring true. In part because Heather Matarazzo is so believable as Dawn and in part because our points of view at that age lacked real perspective. Meaning that we greatly magnify minor incidents of rejection and ridicule.Children who first experience rejection in elementary school typically have a physical or basic hygiene issue. Dawn is not one of those children, she is just one of those who become targets for the first time in junior high school for more subtle differences. Since this is a new thing, she is as much mystified as hurt by this abuse. Not really understanding why it is happening to her, she blunders around in a quest to discover a logical reason for the rejection. At the same time she is dealing with all the physical changes happening to a seventh grade girl. But Dawn's rugged home life has made her self-sufficient and somewhat prepared her for the abuse she has to take in school.Understandably Dawn responds with retaliation, a welcome change from the more typical portrayals of this type of character as a weak victim. Some of her responses are negative like smashing the tape of her parent's anniversary party, pushing away her only friend, and not relaying her mother's message to her little sister about a ride home. Others are positive, like stubbornly refusing to let the taunts from the crowd stop her from finishing her speech. Based on her refusal to apologize at the dinner table, Dawn would probably refuse to ingratiate herself with her classmates even if she knew how. Which puts most viewers even more solidly in her corner as we not only identify but begin to admire her.All three of the Weiner children are excellent. Daria Kalinina does a great job as perfect little sister Missy and Director Todd Solondz uses her ballet talents to give sequences in the family home a great surreal quality. Josiah Trager gives older brother Mark a realistic portrayal.  He is sympathetic to Dawn's daily situation, having gone through the same thing, but he seems to know that the best help he can give is to lead by example. His hardened survivor attitude and future thinking perspective is probably the best way for her to cope with the next five years.Then again, what do I know?

I had to pinch myself to make sure I was not reliving my own preadolescence. Nonetheless, a compelling piece of filmmaking. Matarazzo's Dawn has lost life's lottery in terms of looks, family, friends. Sandwiched between a techno-geek older brother and a little tutu-bottomed sister who twitters through life, Dawn fades into the background so completely her own parents are not aware of her existence until she does something to piss them off. Dawn is mercilessly tormented at school; part of you roots for her and part of you wants to join in. Matarazzo does an excellent job of making Dawn sympathetic, yet realistic. I felt her frustration keenly when she leaned over her little sleeping sister with a hammer, debating whether or not her lot in life would be improved if she simply bashed the competition's head in. So hungry for love is Dawn that she accepts the violent attentions of the neighborhood juvenile delinquent (the amazing Brendan Sexton), even though his interest in her extends only to wanting to &quot;rape her after school.&quot; Through the film, Dawn gains a little insight, becomes a little more her own person, and you think she might make it.

I suppose for us late bloomers, male or female, those not physically beautiful or at least with acceptable personas, seventh grade can break your heart.  If there is weakness in Solondz's film, it's the relentless humiliation and tension.  Yes, there is a knowing laugh here and there, but the pain comes right back.  Dawn is not yet a woman; however, she grasps at any straw that comes her way even if it means rape or violence with a local teen punk.  She courageously loves her brother's friend, the unattainable teen rock and roller, but he wants no part of her youth and gawky looks.These disappointments, her unloving mother and father, indifferent brother, and her babied younger sister are as much an impediment to her happiness as the taunting kids at school.

Anyone who has lived through this excruciating film about Dawn Wiener's junior high school years immediately understands what &quot;it&quot; is, yet to try and replace it with a single proper noun has me stymied.Something is wrong with Dawn. She's &quot;geeky,&quot; sure. But most geeky kids usually at least have the solace of other geeky kids; Dawn doesn't have a friend in the universe. Her counselor notices she is unhappy, so advises her to make some friends, as though it were just that easy.But nothing is wrong with Dawn. She's not learning disabled; she's not mentally ill; she doesn't have Asperger's Syndrome. She may be clinically depressed by the time we see her, but we could argue &quot;chicken or egg&quot; for hours.Dawn endures spitballs in her hair during school assemblies, watching her sister and brother eating chocolate cake while she is given none, standing up to give a speech before her class, and being shouted down with cries of &quot;Wiener dog!&quot; She finally tries her own hand at scraping together a few crumbs of self-esteem, forming a &quot;special people&quot; club, only to be informed that &quot;special people&quot; is a euphemism for &quot;retarded.&quot;Even when her spoiled little sister disappears for a day, Dawn doesn't think that perhaps at least she'll get some parental attention; she thinks that if she finds her sister, maybe she'll have a momentary &quot;Thank you!&quot;The odd thing is, EVERYONE seems to remember junior high school this way. Everyone remembers being spat at, but not spitting, being called names, but not name-calling.Whatever &quot;it&quot; is, everyone remembers it. Maybe that's why the crowd at Sundance cheered. Or maybe it was just Heather Matarazzo's brilliant performance. How hard must it have been for a kid actually in this vulnerable stage to expose it on film?I'm not surprised that this film was rated &quot;R,&quot; and never made it out of the Art House circuit. Children know terrible things, but adults never want to admit that they know. This film is more about adult catharsis than children's reality, although I sincerely believe that had I seen it at the age of eleven or twelve, it would have reduced me to tears.",5,The &quot;It&quot; Girl,1008115200,"12 12, 2001",2001,2694,"['showing', 'film', 'friend', 'mine', 'commented', 'quot', 'parents', 'fault.', 'quot', 'Now', 'culpability', 'quot', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'laid', 'squarely', 'feet', 'Dawn', 'Wiener', 'parents', 'debate', 'not', 'question', 'question', 'statement', 'what', 'exactly', 'antecedent', 'quot', 'quot', 'When', 'asked', 'friend', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'said', 'thought', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'had', 'think', 'question', 'Anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'excruciating', 'film', 'Dawn', 'Wiener', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'immediately', 'what', 'quot', 'quot', 'yet', 'try', 'replace', 'single', 'proper', 'noun', 'stymied.Something', 'wrong', 'Dawn', 'quot', 'geeky', 'quot', 'sure', 'most', 'geeky', 'kids', 'usually', 'least', 'have', 'solace', 'other', 'geeky', 'kids', 'Dawn', ""n't"", 'have', 'friend', 'universe', 'counselor', 'notices', 'unhappy', 'so', 'make', 'friends', 'were', 'just', 'easy.But', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Dawn', 'not', 'learning', 'disabled', 'not', 'mentally', 'ill', ""n't"", 'have', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'may', 'be', 'clinically', 'depressed', 'time', 'see', 'could', 'argue', 'quot', 'chicken', 'egg', 'quot', 'hours.Dawn', 'endures', 'hair', 'school', 'assemblies', 'watching', 'sister', 'brother', 'eating', 'chocolate', 'cake', 'given', 'none', 'standing', 'up', 'give', 'speech', 'class', 'being', 'shouted', 'down', 'cries', 'quot', 'Wiener', 'dog', 'quot', 'finally', 'own', 'hand', 'scraping', 'together', 'few', 'crumbs', 'self-esteem', 'forming', 'quot', 'special', 'people', 'quot', 'club', 'only', 'be', 'informed', 'quot', 'special', 'people', 'quot', 'euphemism', 'quot', 'quot', 'Even', 'when', 'spoiled', 'little', 'sister', 'disappears', 'day', 'Dawn', ""n't"", 'think', 'perhaps', 'least', ""'ll"", 'get', 'parental', 'attention', 'sister', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'have', 'momentary', 'quot', 'Thank', 'quot', 'odd', 'thing', 'EVERYONE', 'remember', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'way', 'Everyone', 'remembers', 'being', 'spat', 'not', 'spitting', 'being', 'called', 'names', 'not', 'name-calling.Whatever', 'quot', 'quot', 'everyone', 'remembers', 'Maybe', 'why', 'crowd', 'Sundance', 'cheered', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'How', 'hard', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'kid', 'actually', 'vulnerable', 'stage', 'expose', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'rated', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'never', 'made', 'Art', 'House', 'circuit', 'Children', 'know', 'terrible', 'things', 'adults', 'never', 'want', 'admit', 'know', 'film', 'more', 'adult', 'catharsis', 'children', 'reality', 'sincerely', 'believe', 'had', 'seen', 'age', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'would', 'have', 'reduced', 'tears']",N/A

I cannot tell you how many times I have watched this movie, especially being in middle school in the late-90s dealing with some of the same issues as Dawn.  In middle school, these are some of the toughest years in a young teens life -- peer pressure, body changes, dating, and social cliques -- all tackled effectively in Dollhouse.  The acting is good as it is not over-the-top and the writing surely does a great job at developing each character with ease.

18990,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0767827740,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 2]","This is probably the blackest of all black comedies to come out of childhood - unflinching in just about every way you'd imagine it wouldn't be.  For one thing, in this film about the hell of youth, the child characters here are not only meaner and openly malicious, but they actually look like children, and not merely post-teens you'll see in every other movie who speak in arch dialog and are interchangeable with adult characters in just about every way.The head doll of this flick is Dawn (Heather Matarazzo) Wiener - for whom looks and last name have earned her the sobriquet ""Wiener Dog"".  Dawn is the middle child of a middle class family - enjoying none of the benefits of seniority monopolized by her geeky brother Mark, nor the fruits of being the baby, greedily (if unconsciously) grasped by her younger sister Missy.  To add insult to injury, Dawn is stuck behind glasses and a huge over-bite.  Those who populate her world either use her as a convenient repository for their own insecurities, or simply hurt her never knowing how fragile she is.  She lusts after the hunky Steve - front man in a band that inexplicably includes the nerdy Mark (Mark seems every bit as Dawn's brother, simply older; he drops some hints of wisdom in Dawn's lap, probably painfully acquired through ordeals not unlike her own; why Steve would put up with being with him is a mystery).  While Steve remains painfully beyond reach, she also ""engages"" Brandon, a younger and more dangerous fellow-student who keeps Dawn's school supplied with pot.  Ostracized by everybody else (no one will accuse this flick of making that behavior seem cool) Brandon fixates on Dawn.  He threatens to rape her, though we know that this is his way of simply reaching out.  (In every sense the child of a broken home, Brandon is incapable of intimacy as we know it, and can only communicate in threats of violence.)  Even when Brandon and Dawn meet, it's Dawn who makes the first move (much to Brandon's painful dismay).  Missy is the other focus of Dawn's life - as relentlessly cute and loveable as Dawn is not.  In their war for their parents' affections, Dawn is less a combatant than collateral damage - often being a prop in Missy's shows of compulsive cuteness.Though the script shows the pressure coming to boil in Dawn's thick skin, the film is actually anti-climactic, which is the big surprise after all.  Regardless of Dawn's feelings and her capacity to explode, surpassing the heart-rending crisis that rocks the Wiener family in the last half-hour, Dawn remains as ignored by her family and spat upon by her peers as she was in the first reel.  (The script hysterically enhances this by having Dawn imagine herself the hero of the crisis that was somewhat her fault; in her dream, even her class learns to love her.  In reality, they fall back on ""Winer Dog"" despite the drama that her family has weathered).  In short, the script works that rare miracle - the ironic non-ending.Though this picture will strike many as remote and unfinished (the lack of closure is only one reason this flick will never be mistaken for Hollywood product), it makes a very decisive statement shortly before the final scene - cruelty isn't something limited to childhood - they call you names in junior high (and presumably through adulthood as well), but never to your face.",4,hell of youth only a prelude to adulthood,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,3345,"['probably', 'blackest', 'black', 'comedies', 'come', 'childhood', 'unflinching', 'just', 'way', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'hell', 'youth', 'child', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'meaner', 'openly', 'malicious', 'actually', 'look', 'children', 'not', 'merely', 'post-teens', ""'ll"", 'see', 'other', 'movie', 'who', 'speak', 'arch', 'dialog', 'are', 'interchangeable', 'adult', 'characters', 'just', 'way.The', 'head', 'doll', 'flick', 'Dawn', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'Wiener', 'whom', 'looks', 'last', 'name', 'have', 'earned', 'sobriquet', 'Wiener', 'Dog', 'Dawn', 'middle', 'child', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'enjoying', 'none', 'benefits', 'seniority', 'monopolized', 'geeky', 'brother', 'Mark', 'fruits', 'being', 'baby', 'greedily', 'unconsciously', 'grasped', 'younger', 'sister', 'Missy', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'Dawn', 'stuck', 'glasses', 'huge', 'over-bite', 'who', 'populate', 'world', 'either', 'use', 'convenient', 'repository', 'own', 'insecurities', 'simply', 'hurt', 'never', 'knowing', 'how', 'fragile', 'hunky', 'Steve', 'front', 'man', 'band', 'inexplicably', 'nerdy', 'Mark', 'Mark', 'bit', 'Dawn', 'brother', 'simply', 'older', 'hints', 'wisdom', 'Dawn', 'lap', 'probably', 'painfully', 'acquired', 'ordeals', 'not', 'own', 'why', 'Steve', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'being', 'mystery', 'Steve', 'painfully', 'reach', 'also', 'engages', 'Brandon', 'younger', 'more', 'dangerous', 'fellow-student', 'who', 'Dawn', 'school', 'supplied', 'pot', 'Ostracized', 'everybody', 'else', 'one', 'will', 'accuse', 'flick', 'making', 'behavior', 'seem', 'cool', 'Brandon', 'Dawn', 'rape', 'know', 'way', 'simply', 'reaching', 'out', 'sense', 'child', 'broken', 'home', 'Brandon', 'incapable', 'intimacy', 'know', 'can', 'only', 'communicate', 'threats', 'violence', 'Even', 'when', 'Brandon', 'Dawn', 'meet', 'Dawn', 'who', 'first', 'move', 'much', 'Brandon', 'painful', 'dismay', 'Missy', 'other', 'focus', 'Dawn', 'life', 'relentlessly', 'cute', 'loveable', 'Dawn', 'not', 'war', 'parents', 'affections', 'Dawn', 'less', 'combatant', 'collateral', 'damage', 'often', 'being', 'prop', 'Missy', 'shows', 'compulsive', 'script', 'pressure', 'coming', 'boil', 'Dawn', 'thick', 'skin', 'film', 'actually', 'anti-climactic', 'big', 'surprise', 'Regardless', 'Dawn', 'feelings', 'capacity', 'explode', 'surpassing', 'heart-rending', 'crisis', 'Wiener', 'family', 'last', 'half-hour', 'Dawn', 'ignored', 'family', 'spat', 'upon', 'peers', 'was', 'first', 'reel', 'script', 'hysterically', 'having', 'Dawn', 'imagine', 'hero', 'crisis', 'was', 'somewhat', 'fault', 'dream', 'even', 'class', 'love', 'reality', 'fall', 'back', 'Winer', 'Dog', 'drama', 'family', 'weathered', 'short', 'script', 'rare', 'miracle', 'ironic', 'non-ending.Though', 'picture', 'will', 'strike', 'many', 'remote', 'unfinished', 'lack', 'closure', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'flick', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'mistaken', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'very', 'decisive', 'statement', 'shortly', 'final', 'scene', 'cruelty', ""n't"", 'something', 'limited', 'childhood', 'call', 'names', 'junior', 'high', 'presumably', 'through', 'adulthood', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'face']",N/A

Even the funny parts (and there are some truly funny moments) had me squirming.  See, it's all very familiar.  No matter what walk of life you are from, if you went to Jr. High, you knew these characters.  Maybe, God forbid, you were one of them.Dawn Wiener (Heather Matarazzo) is cursed from the beginning:  she's at that gawky, awkward, in-between age - after the bliss of young childhood but before the self-assurance of young adulthood.  Called &quot;Wiener Dog&quot; by her tormentors (who comprise nearly every other student at her school), she displays amazing pluck in the face of adversity.  She's no victim in the classic sense; if does not precisely fight back, she doesn't just take it lying down, either.  But there is a sad desperation in her, too.  This film does not condescend - what happens to her is often tragic, and not diminished by the smaller scale of 7th-grade life.  In fact, the name-calling, the insults, the petty violations, and the coldness - they seem that much more harrowing because her shoulders are so narrow.Welcome to the Dollhouse does not develop along the lines of a traditional plot.  It is episodic, told in a series of small, ironic events that form a mosaic of life in the abyss of Jr. High School.  It is woven together remarkably well, with painfully honest performances by the entire cast, a perceptive screenplay, and sly, restrained direction by Todd Solondz.  There are no Big Moments, just lots of little ones that collectively add up.Ultimately, this film is a Rorschach test:  you get from it what you bring to it.  If you had shallow, selfish parents like Dawn's, or if you were a tormentor, or a victim, or lived on the wrong side of the tracks, or the right side, there is a character who represents you; there is a moment that will unexpectedly reveal an awful truth about your own childhood.The brightness at the center of this bitter, angry satire may be that the awful truth can, indeed, set you free.",4,Hell is for children,989712000,"05 13, 2001",2001,2023,"['watched', 'much', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'cold', 'sweat', 'Even', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'had', 'squirming', 'See', 'very', 'familiar', 'matter', 'what', 'walk', 'life', 'are', 'went', 'Jr.', 'High', 'knew', 'characters', 'Maybe', 'God', 'forbid', 'were', 'one', 'them.Dawn', 'Wiener', 'Heather', 'Matarazzo', 'cursed', 'beginning', 'gawky', 'awkward', 'in-between', 'age', 'bliss', 'young', 'childhood', 'self-assurance', 'young', 'adulthood', 'Called', 'quot', 'Wiener', 'Dog', 'quot', 'tormentors', 'who', 'comprise', 'nearly', 'other', 'student', 'school', 'amazing', 'pluck', 'face', 'adversity', 'victim', 'classic', 'sense', 'not', 'precisely', 'fight', 'back', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'lying', 'down', 'either', 'sad', 'desperation', 'too', 'film', 'not', 'condescend', 'what', 'often', 'tragic', 'not', 'diminished', 'smaller', 'scale', '7th-grade', 'life', 'fact', 'name-calling', 'insults', 'petty', 'violations', 'coldness', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'harrowing', 'shoulders', 'are', 'so', 'narrow.Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'not', 'develop', 'lines', 'traditional', 'plot', 'episodic', 'told', 'series', 'small', 'ironic', 'events', 'form', 'mosaic', 'life', 'abyss', 'Jr.', 'High', 'School', 'woven', 'together', 'remarkably', 'well', 'painfully', 'honest', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'perceptive', 'screenplay', 'sly', 'restrained', 'direction', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'are', 'Big', 'Moments', 'just', 'lots', 'little', 'ones', 'collectively', 'add', 'up.Ultimately', 'film', 'Rorschach', 'test', 'get', 'what', 'bring', 'had', 'shallow', 'selfish', 'parents', 'Dawn', 'were', 'tormentor', 'victim', 'lived', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'right', 'side', 'character', 'who', 'moment', 'will', 'unexpectedly', 'reveal', 'awful', 'truth', 'own', 'childhood.The', 'brightness', 'center', 'bitter', 'angry', 'satire', 'may', 'be', 'awful', 'truth', 'can', 'indeed', 'set', 'free']",N/A
