1603230,A3UAQ3JVEFLB0X,B009YQJ31S,David Gertler,"[1, 2]","Wow. This is the best documentary I've seen in a long time. It presents a powerful, moving story - Lithuania's desire for freedom from the Soviet Union - in a well-paced and enthralling way. Sports can be more than just a game; in this case, basketball was an emblem of a nation's pride, and even a method of achieving its liberty. Plenty of game clips and other action shots are shown, along with lots of fascinating commentary from the Lithuanian players, Americans who reported on and/or helped them, American stars who played with or against them, important officials (the head of the country was a brave and inspiring guy), and even Grateful Dead representatives. Warning: there are some mildly gory scenes as the Soviets crack down on Lithuanian independence. But they're more than outweighed by the emotional and uplifting moments.

Didn't really know much about it but I was intrigued and so I decided to pick it up. So glad I did!""The Other Dream Team"" (2012 release; 90 min.) brings the story of how Lithuania, wiht its rich basketball tradition, was annexed by the USSR in 1940. The documentary starts with the basketball victory of the USSR over Team USA in the 1988 Olypmics in Seoul. As it turns out, 4 out of the 5 starters on that USSR team are actually from Lithuania. We then get to know those 4 players, told by present-day interviews of those players. As the documentary unfolds, we see how Lithuania coped during the decades of Russian occupation, and how in 1991 they won their independance, leading to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, where, yes, the US brought its Dream Team (Jordan/Magic Johnson/Bird, etc.), but there was much more at stake for Lithuania. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, kudos to writer-director Marius Markevi&egrave;ius for the clearly painstakingly background work in finding archive footage and interviews with all of the principals, decades after the facts. It really pays off nicely. Second, this is NOT just a sports documentary, as one could expect from the title and premise of this movie. This is as much, if not more so, a political movie about a proud nation that was brutally occupied and repressed for decades. Third, the Grateful Dead played a huge role in ""financing"" the 1992 Olympic Lithuanian basketball team and the documentary features plenty of Dead music. As I watched this, I was moved to tears on more than one occasion. Bottom line: this is a riveting and moving documentary. ""The Other Dream Team"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,Riveting sports/political documentary will move you to tears,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,1865,"['was', 'recently', 'browsing', 'documentary', 'film', 'section', 'local', 'library', 'fell', 'Did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'was', 'intrigued', 'so', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'glad', 'did', 'Other', 'Dream', 'Team', '2012', 'release', '90', 'min', 'story', 'how', 'Lithuania', 'wiht', 'rich', 'basketball', 'tradition', 'was', 'annexed', 'USSR', '1940', 'documentary', 'starts', 'basketball', 'victory', 'USSR', 'Team', 'USA', '1988', 'Olypmics', 'Seoul', 'out', '4', '5', 'starters', 'USSR', 'team', 'are', 'actually', 'Lithuania', 'then', 'get', 'know', '4', 'players', 'told', 'present-day', 'interviews', 'players', 'documentary', 'unfolds', 'see', 'how', 'Lithuania', 'coped', 'decades', 'Russian', 'occupation', 'how', '1991', 'won', 'independance', 'leading', '1992', 'Barcelona', 'Olympics', 'where', 'yes', 'US', 'brought', 'Dream', 'Team', 'Jordan/Magic', 'Johnson/Bird', 'etc', 'there', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'stake', 'Lithuania', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'kudos', 'writer-director', 'Marius', 'Markevi', 'egrave', 'ius', 'clearly', 'painstakingly', 'background', 'work', 'finding', 'archive', 'footage', 'interviews', 'principals', 'decades', 'facts', 'really', 'off', 'nicely', 'Second', 'NOT', 'just', 'sports', 'documentary', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'title', 'premise', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'political', 'movie', 'proud', 'nation', 'was', 'brutally', 'occupied', 'repressed', 'decades', 'Third', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'played', 'huge', 'role', 'financing', '1992', 'Olympic', 'Lithuanian', 'basketball', 'team', 'documentary', 'features', 'plenty', 'Dead', 'music', 'watched', 'was', 'moved', 'tears', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'Bottom', 'line', 'riveting', 'moving', 'documentary', 'Other', 'Dream', 'Team', 'HIGHLY', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",The Other Dream Team
1603235,A1G619WDX45TYY,B009YQJ31S,"Reading Rocks ""Millbrae""","[10, 10]","Although I will only receive this DVD when it is released in Jan. 2013, I did see this on the big screen.  This documentary is a fascinating look at the Lithuanian basketball team that won the Bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.  It provides the back-story to how these athletes worked hard and ultimately, were on the medal stand in Barcelona. When Lithuania was under Soviet occupation, these same guys played on the ""USSR"" basketball squad. These guys tell the real story of what it took for them to succeed and the trials-and-tribulations they had to go through.  Seems that Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead came in at the last second to fund them on their successful quest.  The documentary moves between the players giving their story and American basketball players and announcers providing their input.  If you love basketball and love a story about underdogs who struggle and get to the top, this documentary is for you.  It does offer a primer on the process of how Lithuania gained their independence back in the 1990's which does add to the story of what these guys had to struggle through.  It's a good lesson for young people (teens and older) about striving for your goal amidst the turmoil surrounding you.  I wouldn't recommend this for younger kids since it does have some scenes of real violence when showing the occupation of Vilnius TV tower by the Soviets back in the 1990's.",5,A fascinating look at a team that overcame insurmountable odds to claim victory,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,1418,"['will', 'only', 'receive', 'DVD', 'when', 'released', 'Jan.', '2013', 'did', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'documentary', 'fascinating', 'look', 'Lithuanian', 'basketball', 'team', 'won', 'Bronze', 'medal', '1992', 'Summer', 'Olympics', 'Barcelona', 'back-story', 'how', 'athletes', 'worked', 'hard', 'ultimately', 'were', 'medal', 'stand', 'Barcelona', 'When', 'Lithuania', 'was', 'Soviet', 'occupation', 'same', 'guys', 'played', 'USSR', 'basketball', 'squad', 'guys', 'tell', 'real', 'story', 'what', 'took', 'succeed', 'trials-and-tribulations', 'had', 'go', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'came', 'last', 'second', 'fund', 'successful', 'quest', 'documentary', 'moves', 'players', 'giving', 'story', 'American', 'basketball', 'players', 'announcers', 'providing', 'input', 'love', 'basketball', 'love', 'story', 'underdogs', 'who', 'struggle', 'get', 'top', 'documentary', 'offer', 'primer', 'process', 'how', 'Lithuania', 'gained', 'independence', 'back', '1990', 'add', 'story', 'what', 'guys', 'had', 'struggle', 'good', 'lesson', 'young', 'people', 'teens', 'older', 'striving', 'goal', 'turmoil', 'surrounding', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'younger', 'kids', 'have', 'scenes', 'real', 'violence', 'when', 'showing', 'occupation', 'Vilnius', 'TV', 'tower', 'Soviets', 'back', '1990']",The Other Dream Team
