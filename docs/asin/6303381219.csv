Also, those who aren't famaliar with manga might not get it. It never really explains Seiishiro's relationship to Su-chan, or either of their powers. When I first rented vol 2 I had no clue what was going on, though I still found myself enjoying it. Later I found out much more about the story and bought both the tapes. Anyone who already knows the manga, or at least knows the cast, will most likely love this tape. (Come on, it has Subaru!

It was so awesome! The animation wasn't as good as X, but that's because these movies are older than X (Movie 1 1992; Movie 2 1994). I agree with what people have said about Subaru-kun's voice, to wimpy. And Subaru-kun is not a wimp. I have downloaded the first 5 volumes of the TB manga so the movies do seem to make a little more sense, dealing with Subaru-kun and Seishiro. I suggest any X fan buy this DVD, it is very awesome. I just wish it was longer *sigh*. Tokyo Babylon is now my 2nd favorite anime (X being no. 1) I love CLAMP and all of their works. I strongly suggest any X, Clamp, Subaru, Seishiro or Hokuto fan, buy this DVD.

371075,A26O0T192IBKY1,6303381219,J. Alford,"[1, 2]","Before their appearance in the CLAMP motion picture/anime series/manga X, Subaru(one of the Seven Dragons of Heaven) and Seichiro(one of the Seven Dragons of Earth) had the earlier years of their lives shown in this great occult 2-part OVA series. Here, Subaru is a psychic from a long line of spiritualists who professionally help safeguard people from supernatural occurances. His sister is also a spiritualist of sorts and has a crush on their family's longtime friend, the vet Seichiro. The fate surrounding them in X is not truly given away in the anime, and only breifly mentioned in the X movie. But Tokyo Babylon is still a great look at mysticism in modern-day Japan. The two episodes are totally seperate from each other. The first one had Subaru being called in to investigate a possible murder involving a man with extremely good luck who seems to be the only one surviving all the tragic accidents happening at his company's construction site. The second episode is much longer dealing with a psychopath on a subway, and a woman with post-cognitive powers that allow her to see into the past. The animation is great with theatrical quality and sceneric imagery. This is one of the better of CLAMP's pre-Cardcaptors stories to be done as an anime.

The first one is about Subaru solving a case with a man who is in accidents and never gets hurt but other people do. One of the men who was killed sister wants revenge so she puts a curse on the buliding. The curse is wrong and so it goes out of control. Subaru must stop the curse and the man before more people die. The second story is about a man who kills for fun. Subaru witnesses a woman being killed by the man. A woman who also has psychic powers is involved. She has the power to touch something and immediatly see something that happened in the past. They become friends and she is targeted by the man in the train station. Subaru must find them before she is killed.

His employer mysteriously dies. The only survivor is the only suspect. Now a woman is out for revenge, saying that the man is responsible for her brother's death. Subaru must find the truth and dispel the spirits that protect the guilty party.Episode 2A serial killer is on the loose in Tokyo. Subaru witnesses a murder, but can't identify the killer. He meets a woman that has post cognitive ability. She is able to help Subaru and the police track down the murderer, but things get very dangerous and all involved may end up as victims as well.This is a very different kind of anime. I got it b/c it is the back story to one of the great X characters. The 1st tale didn't do it for me at all, I was very disappointed. The 2nd story is quite good though. For an older anime, the animation is really good. The English dub is below average, but tolerable. The soundtrack is very dated. You can tell when this anime was made just by listening to the music and seeing the outfits that the characters wear. Subaru's wardrobe reminds me a lot of Michael Jackson. One thing that kind of bummed me out was that Subaru would have died in both episodes if Seishiro hadn't been watching his back from the shadows. I was also kind of disappointed that the whole story of Seishiro killing Hokuto wasn't explained at all. That's kind of the reason I bought Tokyo Babylon. All in all, this is a pretty good little OVA.
