We caught it once on PBS and didn't even know that they made a Christmas George movie so she was super excited. I bought it on Amazon a couple days later. I would recommend it to any George fan.

And the songs really are a huge part of it - they're creative and fun, and full of the holiday spirit.We get to see a lot of the regular characters, and follow George and TMITYH while they try to figure out what each other wants for Christmas.  It's funny and touching, and does a great job reinforcing for littler ones that there are things more important than presents at Christmas.And the songs really do get stuck in your head, they're really good.  Higher quality than most songs in cartoons.It's a good length to tell a fuller story than the normal short time slot for the PBS cartoon, but not so long that kids get impatient and lose interest.This one is our house's new ""must watch TV"" for Christmas now.  My son never really got into the older ones I knew as a kid, like Frosty or Rudolph and the other claymation shows. But we watch this all the time - it's on right now, four weeks after Christmas.Definitely worth getting for anyone who has a Curious George fan in their house.",5,My son watches this over and over during the holidays,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,1102,"['even', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'Amazon', 'so', 'play', 'IOS', 'devices', 'car', 'songs', 'so', 'much', 'songs', 'really', 'are', 'huge', 'part', ""'re"", 'creative', 'fun', 'full', 'holiday', 'spirit.We', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'regular', 'characters', 'follow', 'George', 'TMITYH', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'other', 'Christmas', 'funny', 'touching', 'great', 'job', 'reinforcing', 'littler', 'ones', 'are', 'things', 'more', 'important', 'presents', 'Christmas.And', 'songs', 'really', 'do', 'get', 'stuck', 'head', ""'re"", 'really', 'good', 'Higher', 'quality', 'most', 'songs', 'cartoons.It', 'good', 'length', 'tell', 'fuller', 'story', 'normal', 'short', 'time', 'slot', 'PBS', 'cartoon', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'kids', 'get', 'impatient', 'lose', 'interest.This', 'one', 'house', 'new', 'must', 'watch', 'TV', 'Christmas', 'now', 'son', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'older', 'ones', 'knew', 'kid', 'Frosty', 'Rudolph', 'other', 'claymation', 'shows', 'watch', 'time', 'right', 'now', 'four', 'weeks', 'Christmas.Definitely', 'getting', 'anyone', 'who', 'Curious', 'George', 'fan', 'house']",N/A
