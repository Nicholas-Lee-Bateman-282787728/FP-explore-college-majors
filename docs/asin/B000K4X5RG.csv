But, as is all to true of Hollywood, they somehow couldn't resist all the unnecessary gore and horror.  The beheading scene is badly done and full of useless blood spraying everywhere as the crowd acts delighted.  The scene where the woman got her tongue pulled out was over the top and I had trouble sleeping that night due to the PTSD it caused. The scene where they burn all those people to death was another one.  If you have PTSD or any kind of of anxiety or stress issues skip this one and all the pointless gore.  I know that this kind of thing actually happened in those days, but we don't need to witness first hand to appreciate the horror of those times.  This one needs a remake by someone who can tell the story without the blood and screaming.",2,A Gorefest and Bloodbath,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,844,"['gave', 'movie', 'two', 'pure', 'charity', 'acting', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'somehow', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'unnecessary', 'gore', 'horror', 'beheading', 'scene', 'badly', 'done', 'full', 'useless', 'blood', 'spraying', 'everywhere', 'crowd', 'delighted', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'got', 'tongue', 'pulled', 'out', 'was', 'top', 'had', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'night', 'due', 'PTSD', 'caused', 'scene', 'where', 'burn', 'people', 'death', 'was', 'one', 'have', 'PTSD', 'kind', 'anxiety', 'stress', 'issues', 'skip', 'one', 'pointless', 'gore', 'know', 'kind', 'thing', 'actually', 'happened', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'witness', 'first', 'hand', 'appreciate', 'horror', 'times', 'one', 'remake', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'tell', 'story', 'blood', 'screaming']",N/A
1030836,AEXB86K5OEM3L,B000K4X5RG,Luis,"[8, 8]","A surprisingly good film that develops around the hard times that followed the Lutheran christian reform. The movie keeps moving thanks to the obvious violent reaction of Catholics, in a way not far different from any other religion fanatical today. The movie is filmed on a nice medieval location and gives some nice history hints of those times near the Austrian alps. While most actors are not well known they do very descent jobs. The only reason why I don't give it five stars is because the movie slows down a bit, particularly during the first half.",4,surprinsingly unknown but good film,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,556,"['surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'hard', 'times', 'followed', 'Lutheran', 'christian', 'reform', 'movie', 'moving', 'thanks', 'obvious', 'violent', 'reaction', 'Catholics', 'way', 'not', 'far', 'different', 'other', 'religion', 'fanatical', 'today', 'movie', 'filmed', 'nice', 'medieval', 'location', 'nice', 'history', 'hints', 'times', 'Austrian', 'alps', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'do', 'very', 'descent', 'jobs', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'movie', 'down', 'bit', 'particularly', 'first', 'half']",N/A

1030839,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B000K4X5RG,R. Kyle,"[21, 21]","I second the other reviewer's advisory on the description on the back of the box.  The story is about two men who grow up together in a monastery.  One becomes a soldier and ends up losing his status as such, when he marries a witch who'd borne him his son.  The other becomes the Prior in a monastery.As you watch, you see the adversity between Catholics and heretics growing.  Zeal to get rid of all the heretics creates an almost unquenchable fire.  First, there are advisories.  Then there are bounties.  Finally, you better turn someone else in or the Church is coming after you.The costuming, set, and acting is very real--perhaps too much so, but ""Shadow"" is good instruction for us in this time as to how a Holy War and Purge are conducted.  Very worthwhile film--but a difficult watch.",5,Very real and very harsh,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,794,"['second', 'other', 'reviewer', 'advisory', 'description', 'back', 'box', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'together', 'monastery', 'One', 'soldier', 'up', 'losing', 'status', 'such', 'when', 'witch', 'who', ""'d"", 'borne', 'son', 'other', 'Prior', 'monastery.As', 'watch', 'see', 'adversity', 'Catholics', 'heretics', 'growing', 'Zeal', 'get', 'rid', 'heretics', 'almost', 'unquenchable', 'fire', 'First', 'are', 'advisories', 'Then', 'are', 'bounties', 'Finally', 'better', 'turn', 'someone', 'else', 'Church', 'coming', 'you.The', 'costuming', 'set', 'acting', 'very', 'real', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'Shadow', 'good', 'instruction', 'time', 'how', 'Holy', 'War', 'Purge', 'are', 'conducted', 'Very', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'difficult', 'watch']",N/A
1030840,A14R9ACX9TQVX7,B000K4X5RG,Thom Cuddy,"[38, 39]","Shadow of the Sword, or the Headsman, depending on which name you go with, is  a great adventure about Europe's growing pains at the end of the dark ages. The Catholic Church is refusing to give up its exclusive ""trademark"" of God and Jesus, while the baptists are trying to return Christianity to the people. The story focuses on two men, orphans who were once best friends growing up in the local monastery. After they were separated, one became a Captain in the army, while the other became a friar in the Church. The soldier returns and, through a series of events, becomes the town executioner. Meanwhile, struggles within and without the Church set events in motion that will force both men to make decisions that will affect the rest of their lives.The costumes and sets are fantastic, the story is gripping and the actors give compelling performances. I wasn't in the mood for this type of movie when I sat down to watch it, but after 20 minutes I was in it for the long haul. There were few scenes of excessive gore or unnecessary sexual content, but that's the price we pay with every movie made today.There is one warning for DVD viewers out there. The write-up on the back of the box claimed the two friends grew up, one an executioner and one a mercenary. While watching the movie, I kept waiting to see how the (rather wimpy) friar would become a mercenary. He doesn't. If you see this DVD in the rental store or in a video or retail store, keep this error in mind.",5,A great movie at any price!!!,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,1479,"['Shadow', 'Sword', 'Headsman', 'depending', 'name', 'go', 'great', 'adventure', 'Europe', 'growing', 'pains', 'end', 'dark', 'ages', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'refusing', 'give', 'up', 'exclusive', 'trademark', 'God', 'Jesus', 'baptists', 'are', 'trying', 'return', 'Christianity', 'people', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'orphans', 'who', 'were', 'once', 'best', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', 'local', 'monastery', 'were', 'separated', 'one', 'became', 'Captain', 'army', 'other', 'became', 'friar', 'Church', 'soldier', 'returns', 'series', 'events', 'town', 'executioner', 'Meanwhile', 'struggles', 'Church', 'set', 'events', 'motion', 'will', 'force', 'men', 'make', 'decisions', 'will', 'affect', 'rest', 'lives.The', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'fantastic', 'story', 'gripping', 'actors', 'give', 'compelling', 'performances', 'was', ""n't"", 'mood', 'type', 'movie', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', '20', 'minutes', 'was', 'long', 'haul', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'excessive', 'gore', 'unnecessary', 'sexual', 'content', 'price', 'pay', 'movie', 'made', 'one', 'warning', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'out', 'there', 'write-up', 'back', 'box', 'claimed', 'two', 'friends', 'grew', 'up', 'one', 'executioner', 'one', 'mercenary', 'watching', 'movie', 'kept', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'rather', 'wimpy', 'friar', 'would', 'become', 'mercenary', ""n't"", 'see', 'DVD', 'rental', 'store', 'video', 'retail', 'store', 'keep', 'error', 'mind']",N/A
