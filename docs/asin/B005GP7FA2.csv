1460450,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005GP7FA2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","I understand that comedy is subjective. Along with music, it is one of the harder categories of entertainment to judge because, oftentimes, it just comes down to a matter of taste. But comedy DVDs have an additional stigma that other DVD choices don't face. They have less replay value. If you are a fan of a particular comedian and you follow them, you have to expect that you will hear some material that they've used successfully in the past. The most common complaint I see leveled at comedy DVDs are that the jokes aren't fresh. That's right, folks--every time a comedian steps up to the stage, his entire act isn't going to be newly devised and original. And if you were going to tape a show for the general public to buy, wouldn't you use jokes and material that have proven popular and successful? I would! And while I haven't actually seen Smiley perform a complete concert set before, I've followed him enough to be pretty familiar with his brand of humor and recurrent themes.That said, it seems that everybody loves Rickey Smiley. As a popular radio and television host, Smiley has created somewhat of a brand. And the audience of this new comedy concert (originally broadcast on BET) ""Open Casket Sharp"" filmed before an Atlanta crowd is certainly no exception. From the introduction by friend Steve Harvey until the closing curtain, they respond with uproarious glee. Smiley's charm and physical humor, however, often prove more irresistible than his actual jokes. I could watch his brand of silliness for hours, but this particular set lacks a bit of the contemporary relevance that I've come to expect from someone who lives to dissect current events and pop culture. The beginning of the concert has Smiley mimicking various celebrities. Funny, yes, but he repeats the same visual joke involving the boom mike throughout. It's an easy laugh with the crowd, but maybe too easy. The most uproarious bit involves a serious interlude, a tragic death and a funeral. Smiley is perfect in these sequences. And in the final act, Smiley takes to music and marching bands. Probably one of his most notorious songs involves an unfortunate female issue, and it's a terrific idea for a satiric number. But, again, while I liked the premise--the song basically contains two solid jokes and much repetition.Obviously, if you are a Smiley fan--this is something you're going to want to check out. The DVD includes two sketches ""First 48 with Little Darryl"" and ""The Church Lady."" Both, to me, had good ideas but relatively little payoff. Smiley is an incredibly lively, likable, and intelligent performer--he has to be for his day job. I thought this missed a bit of his wit and cleverness. His intelligent brand of commentary is sidetracked for a more physical performance. It's hard not to be caught up, though, in Smiley's infectiousness and he is clearly having a good time. A must for fans and the right audience, but I'm not sure how much newbies and those not in Smiley's intended audience will appreciate this routine. About 3 1/2 stars for my taste, but I'm still a fan.
