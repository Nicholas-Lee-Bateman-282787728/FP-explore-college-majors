1095383,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000UNYJOK,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","A small film about gay Chinese men in London. That's not an easy life and being gay in London, and I guess it is the same everywhere or in many places, is rather disappointing and offers flimsy security. The world outside is hostile, very hostile at times since some young men are so bored that hunting gays is a funny game and since they can't hunt foxes any more they have to look for some substitute animals, and for them gays are just as good as any other game, and I do not mean a card game, rather some living creature that is assimilated to a boar or a hare. And that can be a hairy bore in a way.The fact that the main characters are of Chinese origin does not change anything in the story. In fact it does not even make it deeper or more profound since there is absolutely no trace of racism in the film. The fate of gays in London is shallow and cruel especially when they are young and when they do not want to get attached, probably their Buddhist heritage, but more probably the freedom they want to keep against all odds because they were clandestine for so many centuries that they can't even think of being or going stable which would mean telling everyone including their own parents they are gay. Somewhere they see their parents suddenly hit by nightmares about what they may or may not do in bed with their alter egos.So they live on the side of real humanity. They make believe everyone and themselves they are happy with a one night flimsy superficial sex episode that they call making love though it is nothing and there is no real love in this quick rapid short episode, nothing but pretending. And they kick the transient visitor out or they kick themselves out with the fair intention that it was one time and there will be no second. It is sad, very sad, even painful to see them smile and laugh in a life that is nothing but a dream of a life, in fact a nightmare of a real life.At the very end the director maybe insinuates that maybe perhaps there might be some further developments, a second night after the first, but under duress. That is still not a life. That is still not human. Man, just like women, needs stability and continuity, flexible and fluid adaptability but within some stable frame. Changing sexual partner every night, or even twice a night is not exactly psychologically viable. But some pretend, and that pretension is very emotionally expensive, that it is the basic condition for their happiness and they forget that one day they won't be beautiful any more, they won't be young any more, they won't be desirable any more, they won't find any real satisfaction in internet pornography any more, if ever, when they won't find partners any more.I find the film rather sad though we could consider it as a warning. But there is little effectiveness in giving a warning to the Titanic; It is bound to sink.

1095384,A283RV05QVUTVI,B000UNYJOK,"Michael L. Wiersma ""ksmichael""","[5, 6]","This slick and interesting film chronicles the lives of two relatively affluent Chinese gay guys living in London as they search for love, or at least a good time, while they struggle with their perceptions that they are aging and therefore becoming less attractive.Let's say, first of all, that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that really nobody in this film is particularly unattractive.  The story line about them worrying about their looks and hair patch/ bo tox, etc., really doesn't amount to much.By far the more interesting story lines surround one guy's interest in another man who likes cross-dressing men.  And the other guy inexplicably lands a drop-in roommate who wants desperately to be his lover, but there seems to always be something or someone in the way.There are great moments of truth and humanity in this film and I found myself rewinding to see some of the moments again.  Truly there is some real talent here.  The story, however, for me at least, is the basis and foundation for any good film, and here, unfortunately, it meanders all over the place and goes from nowhere to unresolved and illogical.  All ends with a dull thud.  It's really a shame.I wasn't thrilled with the casual way drug use was treated and didn't think it was necessary to further the plot or ""develop"" the characters.So I would suggest you rent this as there is enough talent here to merit your time, but be warned that the story is kind of lacking.  Kudos to those involved for this worthy effort; maybe next time the quality of the story will match the rest of the talent.",3,"Wildly successful at times, but disappointing overall",1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,1584,"['slick', 'interesting', 'film', 'lives', 'two', 'relatively', 'affluent', 'Chinese', 'gay', 'guys', 'living', 'London', 'search', 'love', 'least', 'good', 'time', 'struggle', 'perceptions', 'are', 'aging', 'therefore', 'becoming', 'less', 'attractive.Let', 'say', 'first', 'beauty', 'eye', 'beholder', 'really', 'nobody', 'film', 'particularly', 'unattractive', 'story', 'line', 'worrying', 'looks', 'hair', 'patch/', 'bo', 'tox', 'etc.', 'really', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much.By', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'lines', 'surround', 'one', 'guy', 'interest', 'man', 'who', 'cross-dressing', 'men', 'other', 'guy', 'inexplicably', 'drop-in', 'roommate', 'who', 'desperately', 'be', 'lover', 'there', 'always', 'be', 'something', 'someone', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'truth', 'humanity', 'film', 'found', 'rewinding', 'see', 'moments', 'again', 'Truly', 'real', 'talent', 'here', 'story', 'however', 'least', 'basis', 'foundation', 'good', 'film', 'here', 'unfortunately', 'place', 'nowhere', 'unresolved', 'illogical', 'dull', 'thud', 'really', 'shame.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'casual', 'way', 'drug', 'use', 'was', 'treated', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'necessary', 'further', 'plot', 'develop', 'characters.So', 'would', 'suggest', 'rent', 'enough', 'talent', 'here', 'merit', 'time', 'be', 'warned', 'story', 'kind', 'lacking', 'Kudos', 'involved', 'worthy', 'effort', 'maybe', 'next', 'time', 'quality', 'story', 'will', 'match', 'rest', 'talent']",N/A
1095385,A107H3XGCV6Y4Q,B000UNYJOK,"Paige Turner ""Film Fanatic""","[2, 2]","This film has its sweet and sour parts, like the delicious Chinese dish. The story centers around 3 Gay Chinese men, age 40, who used to be close friends during their college years. The pivotal character, Gavin, dies early in the film, leaving his two friends to re-examine their own lives. Mel, the Club Stud has a fear of growing old and losing his looks and thus his ability to attract sex partners for casual encounters. He feels as long as he carries on his hedonistic lifestyle of a young man in his 20s, dyed and buff and botoxed, he will not grow old. I found his character to be totally unlikeable; he is a jerk to Todd, a young man who wants nothing more than a monogamous relationship with Mel. Mel treats him like dirt, to be tossed aside when somebody hotter comes along. Perhaps settling down with one person reminds Mel too much of getting older.What I really disliked was the outcome of Todd's character. Initially he is successful in the fashion world and he does get his digs into Mel at the end (deserving, I might add), but then winds up a male prostitute. I suppose that's was meant for comedy, but to me it was a disservice to a young man who only wanted to be loved and settle into a serious relationship.  This character deserved better.The funniest and sweetest scenes were with Ash, a soft-spoken, demure swish who is looking for ""Mr. Right."" His attempts to find a partner is both touching and hilarious. He tries cross-dressing to attract a more butch, straight-acting partner and ends up with Ross, the ex-boyfriend of a cross-dressing friend. Their relationship has its ups and downs, and interestingly, Ash re-enacts the ""cut sleeve"" poem with Ross, though for different reasons. He too, is going through the difficulty of growing old, though he is able to come to terms with it. Poor Mel never does.Hilarious too, were the scenes of Gavin's funeral, where Mel tries to flirt with the priest delivering the eulogy, and Gavin's fiancee, giving an impassioned speech about Gavin's talent in dress design, going so far as to model one of his creations, ""a complete original"", only to see a drag queen friend of Gavin's wearing the same dress. Another funny scene is the reading of Gavin's will.Ash does find happiness, which is quite satisfying.
