My daughters are not interested at all with the two extra shorts on this collection.  I myself do not care for them.So, my 3 star rating is just for the George part of the disc, which in OUR opinion, was fantastic!!  It follows the book exactly which made my older daughter so happy since the hospital story is one of her favorites.  This is not a cartoon, but an early 1980s film with ""Rudolph the Reindeer motion"" - and it is simply adorable.  We watched it over and over again hope to find more Curious George stories by the same production group.Highly recommend it, again, ONLY FOR THE CURIOUS GEORGE SEGMENT!",3,"Curious George was great, but...",1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,672,"['only', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'Curious', 'George', 'disc', 'daughters', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'two', 'extra', 'shorts', 'collection', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'them.So', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'just', 'George', 'part', 'disc', 'OUR', 'opinion', 'was', 'fantastic', 'book', 'exactly', 'made', 'older', 'daughter', 'so', 'happy', 'hospital', 'story', 'one', 'favorites', 'not', 'cartoon', 'early', '1980s', 'film', 'Rudolph', 'Reindeer', 'motion', 'simply', 'adorable', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'hope', 'find', 'more', 'Curious', 'George', 'stories', 'same', 'production', 'group.Highly', 'recommend', 'again', 'ONLY', 'FOR', 'THE', 'CURIOUS', 'GEORGE', 'SEGMENT']",Curious George Goes to the Hospital
845394,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B0002UM11Y,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[8, 9]","This fun and colorful DVD will be sure to keep your children entertained with three different stories contained on it.  The first story is Curious George Goes to the Hospital.  George's curiosity once again gets the best of him in this fun adventure.  George mistakes a puzzle piece for candy, and the piece ends up getting stuck in his stomach.  Soon, he's taken to the hospital by his friend, the Man in the Yellow Hat.  Once there, George meets many new friends and gets his troublesome puzzle piece removed, but not before running into more mischief.Next is Mouse Soup.  A hungry weasel has caught a mouse and plans to make mouse soup, but the mouse proved to be trickier than the hungry weasel bargained for.  The singing crickets are the highlight of this story.The final story on the DVD is called Morris has a Cold.  Morris the moose has caught a cold, and, with the help of his bear friend, he's able to get better quickly.This DVD is excellent for young children.  My 6 and 4 year olds loved each story, especially Curious George.  I highly recommend this great DVD.  Each story is loads of fun, and your children are sure to enjoy each one.",5,Fun Stories for Children!,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,1151,"['fun', 'colorful', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'keep', 'children', 'entertained', 'three', 'different', 'stories', 'contained', 'first', 'story', 'Curious', 'George', 'Goes', 'Hospital', 'George', 'curiosity', 'once', 'again', 'best', 'fun', 'adventure', 'George', 'puzzle', 'piece', 'candy', 'piece', 'up', 'getting', 'stuck', 'stomach', 'Soon', 'taken', 'hospital', 'friend', 'Man', 'Yellow', 'Hat', 'Once', 'there', 'George', 'many', 'new', 'friends', 'troublesome', 'puzzle', 'piece', 'removed', 'not', 'running', 'more', 'mischief.Next', 'Mouse', 'Soup', 'A', 'hungry', 'weasel', 'caught', 'mouse', 'plans', 'make', 'mouse', 'soup', 'mouse', 'proved', 'be', 'trickier', 'hungry', 'weasel', 'bargained', 'singing', 'crickets', 'are', 'highlight', 'story.The', 'final', 'story', 'DVD', 'called', 'Morris', 'Cold', 'Morris', 'moose', 'caught', 'cold', 'help', 'bear', 'friend', 'able', 'get', 'better', 'quickly.This', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'young', 'children', '6', '4', 'year', 'olds', 'loved', 'story', 'especially', 'Curious', 'George', 'highly', 'recommend', 'great', 'DVD', 'story', 'loads', 'fun', 'children', 'are', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'one']",Curious George Goes to the Hospital
