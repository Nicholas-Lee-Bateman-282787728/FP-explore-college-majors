It's a spoof of the classic Jules Verne story AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. The stooges are servants to Phileas Fogg's great-grandson, who plans to redo the classic trip around the world. This is a great movie, and it's fun to see the world.

Don't go in expecting anything close to the masterpieces turned out during the stooges heyday making the short subjects with Curly and Shemp, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.The movie starts off well in the opening with the boys preparing Mr. Fogg's breakfast and some of the reused routines like ""pop goes the weasel"" and the ""maharajah"" routine are pulled off well in this feature. I especially enjoyed Curly-Joe's sumo wrestling rematch with the mighty Itchy-Kitchy.Overall, a pleasant 90 or so minutes and the best of the Stooges 1959-1960s features.",4,The best of the Derita features...,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,661,"[""'m"", 'not', 'wildly', 'enthusiastic', 'Joe', 'Derita', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'anything', 'close', 'masterpieces', 'turned', 'out', 'stooges', 'heyday', 'making', 'short', 'subjects', 'Curly', 'Shemp', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.The', 'movie', 'off', 'well', 'opening', 'boys', 'preparing', 'Mr.', 'Fogg', 'breakfast', 'reused', 'routines', 'pop', 'weasel', 'maharajah', 'routine', 'are', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'feature', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Curly-Joe', 'sumo', 'wrestling', 'rematch', 'mighty', 'Itchy-Kitchy.Overall', 'pleasant', '90', 'so', 'minutes', 'best', 'Stooges', '1959-1960s', 'features']",The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze VHS

374629,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,6303442390,Phil S.,"[2, 3]","There haven't been many completely successful (in the artistic sense) feature length slapstick or broad comedies starring legendary comics such as the Three Stooges, and here's another one which should have been much funnier - opportunities fall by the wayside as the director, writer, and editor seem to forget what makes this kind of humor work - it's got to move fast, there's got to be quotable funny lines, etc.In all fairness, you could count on two hands the collective feature-length *classics* by Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, and others. Jerry Lewis has two classics (""The Errand Boy"" and ""The Nutty Professor"") but the point is that 100+ minutes is too long for this genre.This film is definitely one of their best, however; the story, based upon Jules Verne's Around The World In 80 Days, and, in a way, foreshadowing ""Smokey And The Bandit"" - don't look at me like that! - has a nice flow, and the supporting actors are fine. Joan Freeman is an exotic beauty who also did a good job on Elvis Presley's ""Roustabout"", not long after this entry.But if you're looking at this movie critically (by the way, it runs too long and should have been shot in color) then perhaps you're in the wrong spirit: it was wonderful that older comedians were finally making a few bucks and getting some long overdue attention. And more significantly, their timing and ad-lib talent was intact.",3,Late career respectable effort,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,1393,"['have', ""n't"", 'been', 'many', 'completely', 'successful', 'artistic', 'sense', 'feature', 'length', 'slapstick', 'broad', 'comedies', 'starring', 'legendary', 'comics', 'such', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'here', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'funnier', 'opportunities', 'fall', 'wayside', 'director', 'writer', 'editor', 'seem', 'forget', 'what', 'kind', 'humor', 'work', 'got', 'move', 'fast', 'got', 'be', 'quotable', 'funny', 'lines', 'etc.In', 'fairness', 'could', 'count', 'two', 'hands', 'collective', 'feature-length', '*classics*', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'others', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'two', 'classics', 'Errand', 'Boy', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'point', '100+', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'genre.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'however', 'story', 'based', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'World', '80', 'Days', 'way', 'foreshadowing', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'nice', 'flow', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'Joan', 'Freeman', 'exotic', 'beauty', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Roustabout', 'not', 'long', 'entry.But', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'critically', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'color', 'then', 'perhaps', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'spirit', 'was', 'wonderful', 'older', 'comedians', 'were', 'finally', 'making', 'few', 'bucks', 'getting', 'long', 'overdue', 'attention', 'more', 'significantly', 'timing', 'ad-lib', 'talent', 'was', 'intact']",The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze VHS
