773744,A244T2V6PVFCZ6,B0000C7PVS,"Brett ""Reviewer""","[4, 10]","I greatly enjoyed most of this anime, and as one earlier reviewer posted, ""I kept going for the characters."" The characters were ultimately what kept me going in the anime series, not only Marlene and Yugi, but the minor characters as well. I should warn that this review may include some small later spoilers, but I will try to keep these to a minimum.What I liked:As I mentioned, I greatly enjoyed the characters, particularly early on in the storyline before Yugi and Marlene reach the Baikonur base. The 'awakening' scene of Yugi, where he suddenly is awakened to be thrown into a horrific battle between mecha and a giant 'blue' insect that has basically torn apart everyone in the storing area, is one of the most emotionally powerful sequences I have ever seen in both anime and film. Not only that, but Yugi, and Marlene, largely react as one would expect residents of their respective worlds to act.What I disliked:Although I greatly enjoyed this anime, there were certainly a number of things that I disliked. These are the main three.1. The Lack of Realism. Although this is a bit of a personal preference, and anime generally isn't intended to be completely realistic, certain features of the technology and design used in Blue Gender came to eventually bother me.First off, the Blue are a group of giant insects (some flying, some not), who are mostly covered with armor that can only be penetrated with difficulty. At the same time, they have a usually open weak point that can lead to them being killed by weapons as low-power as a pistol. Why, then, would the humans pick weapons and mecha that are actually weak to the Blue? The mecha design would lead to greater instability as opposed to a tank, which would be more sturdily based.Add on to this the Second Earth space station. It is shown that Second Earth is a basically self-reliable space station that includes what appears to be a lunar colony. Why, then, don't they simply settle mostly on the Moon? Certainly it would be easier to simply build lunar structures, taking advantage of lunar resources then and there, rather than sending them up into space, then to a free-standing structure.2. The Later Plot Development Post-Baikonur. Although I greatly enjoyed the first sequence leading to Baikonur, and the latter sequences had their moments, for the most part, following the arrival in Second Earth, the plot takes a strong downturn. It becomes a more cliched We Need to Utterly Annihilate The Blue, with undertones of People Need to Live in Harmony, Gaia, and The Quiet Guy on the Verge of Explosion and Treason. The ending, in particular, is atrociously predictable, ignoring the interesting story that develops after the first main arc in Second Earth.3. The characters. Although it may be strange to mention the characters as both a strength and a weakness, Yugi's character became noticeably weaker after arriving in Second Earth. Essentially the first major arc, leading to Baikonur, is character development of Marlene from a nearly emotionless killing machine, to a more human, warm person. After this is over, the story writers then go on to set up YUGI as the emotionless killing machine, and lead him through a predictable return to a more human, warm person.The criticism above might make it seem like I don't really like this anime, when nothing could be further from the truth. I greatly enjoyed watching this, although specific bits annoyed me.",4,Deeply dark sci-fi anime with serious themes,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,3437,"['greatly', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'anime', 'one', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'posted', 'kept', 'going', 'characters', 'characters', 'were', 'ultimately', 'what', 'kept', 'going', 'anime', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'Marlene', 'Yugi', 'minor', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'warn', 'review', 'may', 'include', 'small', 'later', 'spoilers', 'will', 'try', 'keep', 'minimum.What', 'liked', 'mentioned', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'particularly', 'early', 'storyline', 'Yugi', 'Marlene', 'reach', 'Baikonur', 'base', ""'awakening"", 'scene', 'Yugi', 'where', 'suddenly', 'awakened', 'be', 'thrown', 'horrific', 'battle', 'mecha', 'giant', ""'blue"", 'insect', 'basically', 'torn', 'apart', 'everyone', 'storing', 'area', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'sequences', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'anime', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'Yugi', 'Marlene', 'largely', 'react', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'residents', 'respective', 'worlds', 'act.What', 'disliked', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'anime', 'were', 'certainly', 'number', 'things', 'disliked', 'are', 'main', 'three.1', 'Lack', 'Realism', 'bit', 'personal', 'preference', 'anime', 'generally', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'completely', 'realistic', 'certain', 'features', 'technology', 'design', 'used', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'came', 'eventually', 'bother', 'me.First', 'off', 'Blue', 'are', 'group', 'giant', 'insects', 'flying', 'not', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'covered', 'armor', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'penetrated', 'difficulty', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'usually', 'open', 'weak', 'point', 'can', 'lead', 'being', 'killed', 'weapons', 'as', 'low-power', 'pistol', 'Why', 'then', 'would', 'humans', 'pick', 'weapons', 'mecha', 'are', 'actually', 'weak', 'Blue', 'mecha', 'design', 'would', 'lead', 'greater', 'instability', 'opposed', 'tank', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'sturdily', 'based.Add', 'Second', 'Earth', 'space', 'station', 'shown', 'Second', 'Earth', 'basically', 'self-reliable', 'space', 'station', 'what', 'be', 'lunar', 'colony', 'Why', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'simply', 'settle', 'mostly', 'Moon', 'Certainly', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'simply', 'build', 'lunar', 'structures', 'taking', 'advantage', 'lunar', 'resources', 'then', 'there', 'rather', 'sending', 'up', 'space', 'then', 'free-standing', 'structure.2', 'Later', 'Plot', 'Development', 'Post-Baikonur', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'sequence', 'leading', 'Baikonur', 'latter', 'sequences', 'had', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'following', 'arrival', 'Second', 'Earth', 'plot', 'strong', 'downturn', 'more', 'cliched', 'Need', 'Utterly', 'Annihilate', 'Blue', 'undertones', 'People', 'Need', 'Live', 'Harmony', 'Gaia', 'Quiet', 'Guy', 'Verge', 'Explosion', 'Treason', 'ending', 'particular', 'atrociously', 'predictable', 'ignoring', 'interesting', 'story', 'first', 'main', 'arc', 'Second', 'Earth.3', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'strange', 'mention', 'characters', 'strength', 'weakness', 'Yugi', 'character', 'became', 'noticeably', 'weaker', 'arriving', 'Second', 'Earth', 'Essentially', 'first', 'major', 'arc', 'leading', 'Baikonur', 'character', 'development', 'Marlene', 'nearly', 'emotionless', 'killing', 'machine', 'more', 'human', 'warm', 'person', 'story', 'writers', 'then', 'go', 'set', 'up', 'YUGI', 'emotionless', 'killing', 'machine', 'lead', 'predictable', 'return', 'more', 'human', 'warm', 'person.The', 'criticism', 'might', 'make', 'seem', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'anime', 'when', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'specific', 'bits', 'annoyed']",N/A

773746,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0000C7PVS,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[11, 11]","In the future, civilization has collapsed, because the earth is infested by big, big bugs.It sounds like the stuff of utter mind blowing disaster, but thankfully ""Blue Gender"" succeeds in being a fairly intelligent, intricate sci-fi anime. Lots of horror, giant bugs and a fish-out-of-water hero who manages to be fairly interesting as he becomes a seasoned warrior, but the characters develop by leaps and bounds -- and the ending is completely out of left field, apparently in an attempt to be bleak and ""deep.""Yuji Kaido was an ordinary teenager in the not-too-distant future, until he came down with a strange disease. The only hope for a cure is to be put into cryogenic sleep.A few decades later, he awakes to a whole new Earth -- sparsely populated, civilization overturned, and with every continent overrun by hideous enormous insects called the Blue. Then two enormous mecha piloted by humans appear, and after many dangers Yuji is taken by a chilly soldier named Marlene to Second Earth, a space station where humanity is organizing a fight against the Blue.But Yuji soon learns that life is dangerous -- not just because of the Blue, but because of the militarized humans on Second Earth, who see him just as a sample to be used. After Yuji vanishes, Marlene begins a desperate quest to find him, even if it gets her in hot water. And when she does find him, they both discover the secret of Yuji and the Sleepers, and why they may be the key to destroying the Blue once and for all. Except of course things aren't that simple.""Blue Gender"" has a pretty generic sci-fi concept behind it, the sort of thing you'd probably see on a Sci Fi original movie. Fortunately the actual series is much better than you'd think -- a vivid cocktail of action, conspiracy-laden suspense and science fiction in equal measure, but with the occasional pauses injected between the action and suspense sequences, where the writers can focus on the characters and what they feel.Along the way, there's lots of grotesque, vaguely Freudian megabugs that have swarmed all over the globe, and whose origins are explored even as they eat people and overturn large machines. Lots of splattered gore, enormous insects that almost look real, and big industrial-looking mecha. But as the series winds on, there's an increasing emphasis on what the humans are doing as well, and their desperation to defeat the Blue -- and there are some surprising plot twists thrown into the mix.The biggest weak point? The ending is a disaster that throws out most of what comes before it, in the name of a bizarre pseudo-environmental message that just explodes out of the, ahem, Blue. It feels like the writers couldn't come up with a suitably epic ending, so they went for the most bleak and ""deep"" finale they could.Yuji is a bit of a pain at first, since he does nothing but scream and panic over the first few episodes. But after a little while, he decides to become master of his own fate, and his story arc shows him turn from a nice ordinary guy to a hardened soldier. On the flipside, Marlene starts as an ice princess, but we see her graduallythawing under Yuji's influence until she has become more like he once was, and vice versa. Most of the secondary characters die off or vanish pretty quickly, but they're well-drawn as well.""Blue Gender Box Set"" is a solid sci-fi/action anime with plenty of giant bugs and military attacks, but the ending entirely spins out of control.",4,Scifi-anime with big bugs,1062028800,"08 28, 2003",2003,3455,"['future', 'civilization', 'collapsed', 'earth', 'infested', 'big', 'big', 'bugs.It', 'stuff', 'utter', 'mind', 'blowing', 'disaster', 'thankfully', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'being', 'fairly', 'intelligent', 'intricate', 'sci-fi', 'anime', 'Lots', 'horror', 'giant', 'bugs', 'fish-out-of-water', 'hero', 'who', 'be', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'seasoned', 'warrior', 'characters', 'develop', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'ending', 'completely', 'left', 'field', 'apparently', 'attempt', 'be', 'bleak', 'deep', 'Yuji', 'Kaido', 'was', 'ordinary', 'teenager', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'came', 'down', 'strange', 'disease', 'only', 'hope', 'cure', 'be', 'put', 'cryogenic', 'sleep.A', 'few', 'decades', 'later', 'whole', 'new', 'Earth', 'sparsely', 'populated', 'civilization', 'overturned', 'continent', 'overrun', 'hideous', 'enormous', 'insects', 'called', 'Blue', 'Then', 'two', 'enormous', 'mecha', 'piloted', 'humans', 'appear', 'many', 'dangers', 'Yuji', 'taken', 'chilly', 'soldier', 'named', 'Marlene', 'Second', 'Earth', 'space', 'station', 'where', 'humanity', 'organizing', 'fight', 'Blue.But', 'Yuji', 'soon', 'life', 'dangerous', 'not', 'just', 'Blue', 'militarized', 'humans', 'Second', 'Earth', 'who', 'see', 'just', 'sample', 'be', 'used', 'Yuji', 'vanishes', 'Marlene', 'desperate', 'quest', 'find', 'even', 'hot', 'water', 'when', 'find', 'discover', 'secret', 'Yuji', 'Sleepers', 'why', 'may', 'be', 'key', 'destroying', 'Blue', 'once', 'course', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'simple', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'pretty', 'generic', 'sci-fi', 'concept', 'sort', 'thing', ""'d"", 'probably', 'see', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'original', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'actual', 'series', 'much', 'better', ""'d"", 'think', 'vivid', 'cocktail', 'action', 'conspiracy-laden', 'suspense', 'science', 'fiction', 'equal', 'measure', 'occasional', 'pauses', 'injected', 'action', 'suspense', 'sequences', 'where', 'writers', 'can', 'focus', 'characters', 'what', 'feel.Along', 'way', 'lots', 'grotesque', 'vaguely', 'Freudian', 'megabugs', 'have', 'swarmed', 'globe', 'origins', 'are', 'explored', 'even', 'eat', 'people', 'overturn', 'large', 'machines', 'Lots', 'splattered', 'gore', 'enormous', 'insects', 'almost', 'look', 'real', 'big', 'industrial-looking', 'mecha', 'series', 'increasing', 'emphasis', 'what', 'humans', 'are', 'doing', 'as', 'well', 'desperation', 'defeat', 'Blue', 'are', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'thrown', 'mix.The', 'biggest', 'weak', 'point', 'ending', 'disaster', 'out', 'most', 'what', 'name', 'bizarre', 'pseudo-environmental', 'message', 'just', 'ahem', 'Blue', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'suitably', 'epic', 'ending', 'went', 'most', 'bleak', 'deep', 'finale', 'could.Yuji', 'bit', 'pain', 'first', 'nothing', 'scream', 'panic', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'little', 'while', 'become', 'master', 'own', 'fate', 'story', 'arc', 'turn', 'nice', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'hardened', 'soldier', 'flipside', 'Marlene', 'ice', 'princess', 'see', 'graduallythawing', 'Yuji', 'influence', 'become', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'vice', 'versa', 'Most', 'secondary', 'characters', 'die', 'vanish', 'pretty', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'well-drawn', 'well', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'Box', 'Set', 'solid', 'sci-fi/action', 'anime', 'plenty', 'giant', 'bugs', 'military', 'attacks', 'ending', 'entirely', 'control']",N/A

773749,A2GVJ83F092MIS,B0000C7PVS,J. Hayes,"[34, 37]","When Blue Gender first aired on Adult Swim, I really got into it but I never saw the whole thing. Just from what I did see I felt justified in buying the box set and I knew I wouldn't regret it. After viewing all 26 episodes, I can go far as to say this is the best anime series I have ever seen with the exception of Cowboy Bebop. Trust me though, Blue Gender is a very close second.Yuji Kaido, the main character, is diagnosed with an incurable disease so he becomes a &quot;sleeper&quot;, and the plan is to wake him when mankind finds a cure. After he has been asleep for much longer than he was told, he is awakened to find out the world he once knew has become his worst nightmare. The Earth has been invaded by giant insects known as the &quot;Blue&quot;. The blue have wiped out most of the Earth's population and those who remained left to a space station called Second Earth. It is a recovery team from Second Earth that awakens Yuji, and the team is there with the mission of bringing back as many sleepers from Earth as possible. In fact it is Marlene Angel that wakes Yuji, and the two soon have to work together if they are going to make it out alive.This is a series filled with emotion, strong violence, and nudity. Some may opt to pass on this series due to these themes, but I can't recommend seeing this enough. Seeing Yuji's nightmare as he awakens on Earth is incredible, as is his transformation into the fighter he becomes. There are twists in the storyline at every turn, and the action is nonstop. I never felt like the plot was dragging, as every episode left me wanting to see more. It is just that incredible. The animation is pretty good and works for this series. I especially like the design of the different kinds of Blue, which add so much to the effect of the action. And the best bug comes in the end, but youll have to see what I mean. Another thing that makes this a great series are the characters, who have so much personality. They are realistic people in a war against a species that has invaded their Earth. So by now you have the basic idea behind Blue Gender, and there are too many great plot twists for me to say anymore about that.There is a certain reviewer about 3 down from me who claims this anime has a weak story, bad animation and was a total waste of money. I have to ask: what Blue Gender did you watch? I mean I can understand that this might not be a title for everyone, but to say it was a complete waste of 536 minutes with absolutely no good? I have to disagree about the main character Yuji, who is annoying when he first wakes up, but as he realixes what he must do to take back his Earth his personality becomes more complex. But anybody who hasnt seen this, at least rent it first before you buy reviews that tell you that this series is total crap.Packaging for this set is superb, with a great looking art box to hold all 8 volumes of the series. It is a high price for the whole set, although you can buy the volumes individually for about $20 each. It is definaely cheaper in the long run to buy the box set, and if you look in the right places you can find it for way less than the $120 retail price ( I bought mine for $70 new). As for extras, each volume contains some art galleries, character bios, and trailers for other anime releases. Nothing groundbreaking, but good.

773750,A1UD9T4T8A6H1A,B0000C7PVS,Joel Jankiewicz,"[6, 7]","Blue Gender is considered sometimes to be one of those 'silent hits'. It's a great series, but doesn't have a huge group to appeal too. It's a great anime series meant for the mature anime audience. It's also been joked about how it has some similarities to Starship Troopers, although I doubt it was intentional.Blue Gender follows the characters Yuji Kaido and Marlene Angel. Yuji is a young man who was put on ice in 2007 because of an illness, then wakes up in 2031 to find the world infested by the Blue, insect like creatures. Marlene is a soldier from a space station called Second Earth, who was sent to retrieve him. This sets the stage for action, sadness, drama, the whole 9 yards. However, this series lacks comedy, as it wasn't meant to have it. Blue Gender is a dark and bloody series, with many tragic and sad moments to make the audience feel for the characters.This is an excellent series, the characters are well developed, the animation is great and consistant, and it makes you think. Blue Gender shouldn't be underestimated for not being as wide spread as other animes (Such as Mobile Suit Gundam or Dragon Ball), but this series packs alot of punch. However, it should be noted that this series also doesn't shy away from fanservice, as there is a quite a bit of it. However, it's fairly kept under control.If you're a mature anime fan who wants a great series that is dark, Blue Gender is the one for you! Don't get this if you're young(It's meant for 15 and above, which isn't an understatement) or faint of heart. There is alot of tragedy and sadness, but it helps progress the story to a great ending.If you want to get all of Blue Gender in one shot, go for the DVD set if you can, it saves yout time and money, as you get it all in one package. It's cheaper in the long run(Compared to buying each DVD separately), and saves time as you get all the DVDs at once.Five out of five stars in my book, Blue Gender gets my thumbs up!",5,Blue Gender is a must have series for the mature audience,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,1955,"['Blue', 'Gender', 'considered', 'sometimes', 'be', 'one', ""'silent"", 'hits', 'great', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'group', 'appeal', 'too', 'great', 'anime', 'series', 'meant', 'mature', 'anime', 'audience', 'also', 'been', 'joked', 'how', 'similarities', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'doubt', 'was', 'intentional.Blue', 'Gender', 'characters', 'Yuji', 'Kaido', 'Marlene', 'Angel', 'Yuji', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'put', 'ice', '2007', 'illness', 'then', 'up', '2031', 'find', 'world', 'infested', 'Blue', 'insect', 'creatures', 'Marlene', 'soldier', 'space', 'station', 'called', 'Second', 'Earth', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'retrieve', 'stage', 'action', 'sadness', 'drama', 'whole', '9', 'yards', 'However', 'series', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'have', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'dark', 'bloody', 'series', 'many', 'tragic', 'sad', 'moments', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'characters.This', 'excellent', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'animation', 'great', 'consistant', 'think', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'underestimated', 'not', 'being', 'wide', 'spread', 'other', 'animes', 'Such', 'Mobile', 'Suit', 'Gundam', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'series', 'alot', 'punch', 'However', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'series', 'also', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'fanservice', 'quite', 'bit', 'However', 'fairly', 'kept', 'control.If', ""'re"", 'mature', 'anime', 'fan', 'who', 'great', 'series', 'dark', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'one', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', ""'re"", 'young', 'meant', '15', ""n't"", 'understatement', 'faint', 'heart', 'alot', 'tragedy', 'sadness', 'progress', 'story', 'great', 'ending.If', 'want', 'get', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'one', 'shot', 'go', 'DVD', 'set', 'can', 'yout', 'time', 'money', 'get', 'one', 'package', 'cheaper', 'long', 'run', 'Compared', 'buying', 'DVD', 'separately', 'saves', 'time', 'get', 'DVDs', 'once.Five', 'five', 'stars', 'book', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'thumbs', 'up']",N/A

773755,A3FIKATQ286DMV,B0000C7PVS,Niko,"[1, 2]","Definitely for adults and an amazing show!!!This is my opinion about the shows. First of all, a few words about the story. In the near future, the main character, Yuji Kaido, has been diagnosed, as other ordinary people, in having an incurable disease. Because there was no cure available at that time they put him with the others alike into hibernation, supposed for a time span of two years. Unfortunately for them, in the mean time Earth got invaded by alien bucks, called ""Blue"" and most humans got killed. For this reason, humans retreated to a space station called Second Earth. A few decades later, Yuji was awakened by a soldier among other commrades, who was sent down on earth to find the ""sleepers"" (and there is a reason for it), in other words the ones that had been put into hibernation. The soldier was no other than Marlene Angel, who is the other main character of the show. In the mists of war, a love story will start to evolve around these two main protagonists who will have to go through various dangers and do everything to survive and to safe the world (well, what is left of it). The story has many twists and although it refers to a (near)future time the messeges that this show ""sends out"" are all the ones that we are facing nowadays, like the environment, human behavior towards others, military/political power games etc. In the show we see a possible outcome of our actions.SPOILERS INCLUDED!!!Some explanations that I consider important so that the people who read our reviews and are wandering if to buy the shows or not can have a better picture of the shows.As for the battle scenes, yes they are brutal and realistic. To get a better idea, if someone is caught up in a war zone and his or her friend gets shot etc. then of course blood and body parts will fly around. That is how REALITY is and that is what is shown in these series.Moreover, the series try to present things as they would be, if something like this would happen for real. For instance, Yuji comes more or less from our time continuum and now he is confronted with what human beings, after these experiences, consider to be appropriate. To simplify matters, Yuji sees things with today's values but Marlene, at the beginning, is cold, sleeps around etc (something that changes later on). She justifies her actions in saying that if she doesn't know if she is going to be alife the next minute than why shouldn't she feel alife (well, something among those lines). The question is, if you were in a situation like this how would you re-evaluate your own (or today's) values?Apart from it, someone said something like, Yuji was ""crying"" etc. Let us make a comparison: In Evangelion the main protagonist was ""crying"" all the time till the end. However, many consider the shows as unique and brilliant of its kind (well, me included). Fortunately, and in contrast to the main character of Evangelion, after Yuji gets through the first shock he gets his s*** together and becomes amazing.As for the storyline, my humble opinion is that it is a very good one, interesting, a lot of action (which is astonishing), violent, science-fiction drama, romance and the character development deep and very well executed. As for the atmosphere of the show, well it is dead serious and no silly things will occur at all; something that possibly would happen in real life if humans were confronted with such threat.The dub is actually very good.The animation is very good (of course, there will be definitely a few shows out there that have a better animation).Now to the main two questions: Should someone watch the shows and most of all buy them?If you can afford the money, than you should certainly buy it and be reassured that you will not regret it at all.One more thing to consider: The shows are aiming at a more adult audience - now you understand why it also is ultra-violent, has nudity etc. - and therefore, if you are parents and have very young children, my personal suggestion would be to watch the shows when they are asleep or not around.About the movie (Blue Gender ""The Warrior""):Well, if you have watched the shows than you do not need to buy the movie of blue gender; which is basically, a ""putting-together"" of the series with a few changes and a different ending (still a good one, but completely different as the one of the series). The box-set has the entire series and the movie included. The series would get straight 5 stars but the movie not more than 3.I hope that I was helpful...",5,Truly an amazing show!!!

Mechs, giant Bugs and loads of Guns. What else could you ask for ?The Story is pretty solid for a Sci-Fi Anime, at the beginning of the series its fairly annoying with Yuji Kaido's whining, Marlene is boring and has no Emotions for the first half or so. But after the 5th Episode it really starts to advance and the parts of the story start to add up. You could say the story is about a Man's regained Strengh and a Women's regained Tenderness.The Animation of Blue Gender is outstanding, the colours blend in well together and the Backgrounds are very well detailed and the character designs even better.

In is sleep gigantic insect like creatures known as the blue appeared and have have driven Humanity to the edge of exstinction. Awaken into this nightmare by the few survivors to help take back planet and give humanity back its future. But first in order to save the future he'll have to survive.Okay that came off more as a preview instead of the plot set up sorry. Any way time for the review. Blue Gender is without a doubt a master piece. The animation is amazingly smooth and clean for a nearly ten year old anime. The voice acting is also top notch, as his the haunting errie music. The character designs are lovely. The plot is complex and winding to the point that it makes it impossible to guess what is going to happen next. The Characters are also likeable and change quiet a bit thew out the series. But no mistake this is an adult anime, there are plenty of graphic violance, mild nudity, lots of sexual situations and grotec scenory. The series mantains a dark tone threw out the series with few jokes scattered about most of which are genually funny. The thing that most impressed me about Blue Gender that it's not really a mindless monster of the week that wants to destroy humanity for no reason. Everything has a scientificly plosible explaination. Nothing happens without a logic or emotional answer.As for the flaws, I really can't think of any believe it or not.
