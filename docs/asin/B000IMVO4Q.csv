More so, the bad music often drowned the speaker's voice into unintelligible mumbles. You really have to focus to understand what is being said.I cannot speak for the related book, though in all I think the movie could have used better production/management and scripting to generate a more substantive message.  If anything, the video serves best as a ""summary"" of the author's opinion/theories and may encourage one to read further.",3,"Interesting, though lacking in substance",1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,538,"[""'m"", 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'material', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'lacking', 'substance', 'More', 'so', 'bad', 'music', 'often', 'drowned', 'speaker', 'voice', 'unintelligible', 'mumbles', 'really', 'have', 'focus', 'understand', 'what', 'being', 'said.I', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'related', 'book', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'better', 'production/management', 'scripting', 'generate', 'more', 'substantive', 'message', 'anything', 'video', 'best', 'summary', 'author', 'opinion/theories', 'may', 'encourage', 'one', 'read', 'further']","Gnosis, the Secret of Solomon's Temple Revealed"

I did watch it all the way through to give it a fair chance but in the end, the presentation just killed the experience.The music was too loud when the narrator spoke, and the narrator's voice was just not distinct enough to make the information come alive (very monotone).  The video looked like it had been done on a home PC prior to the ""new and improved"" video imaging software was available.None of it made sense, even to me being a fan of this type of genre.  I gave it 2 stars based on the information alone (only because I know it).  I am not accustomed to being this critical on topics that interest me, but I cannot in good faith recommend buying this video.  If your curiosity is burning to see it, then I would suggest borrowing from a friend or checking it out from the library (if they have it).",2,The Presentation Killed the Message,1235088000,"02 20, 2009",2009,914,"['Being', 'fan', 'type', 'history', 'lore', 'say', 'video', 'was', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'did', 'watch', 'way', 'give', 'fair', 'chance', 'end', 'presentation', 'just', 'killed', 'experience.The', 'music', 'was', 'too', 'loud', 'when', 'narrator', 'spoke', 'narrator', 'voice', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'distinct', 'enough', 'make', 'information', 'come', 'alive', 'very', 'monotone', 'video', 'looked', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'home', 'PC', 'prior', 'new', 'improved', 'video', 'imaging', 'software', 'was', 'available.None', 'made', 'sense', 'even', 'being', 'fan', 'type', 'genre', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'based', 'information', 'alone', 'only', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'accustomed', 'being', 'critical', 'topics', 'interest', 'can', 'not', 'good', 'faith', 'recommend', 'buying', 'video', 'curiosity', 'burning', 'see', 'then', 'would', 'suggest', 'borrowing', 'friend', 'checking', 'library', 'have']","Gnosis, the Secret of Solomon's Temple Revealed"
