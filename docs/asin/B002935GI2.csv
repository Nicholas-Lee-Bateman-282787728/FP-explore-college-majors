And Visioneers almost did it.  But the main character here seems to be the red Swingline stapler guy from Office Space.  One who has been beaten down and oppressed to the point where there is no turning back from ending it all.  Yeah, it feels that depressing.  If you want a depressing movie about a guy who has a crappy job in a crappy world, then this is the movie for you.

1256434,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B002935GI2,Brian E. Erland,"[6, 9]","The 2010 low budget indie film `Visioneer' starring Zach Galifianakis presents the audience with a vision of a possible dark, authoritarian future. Be prepared for a powerful, clear and disturbingly accurate vision of a world without self awareness and purpose.Synopsis: This is dark comedy at its depressing best, or at least that's how it begins and maintains through most of the movie. Yes this is truly a future world without any reason to exist. In the future scheme of things only productivity is valued, individual pursuit of excellence, friendship, love and anything else worthwhile you may think of no longer holds any meaning. We have become rats in a maze and nothing more. The loss of meaning, the understated confusion and the thinly guised desperation simple exudes from the screen. Laid out before us is a society in utter pain and that pain is exquisitely displayed on the face of the film's star, Zach Galifianakis. He is a man about to explode, literally, which is what people do when they can no longer stand living in a world with no meaning. Our hero has reached the point of critical mass and realizes that he must either break free and discover personal happiness or explode. It isn't easy in a society that has all but lost the ability to look outside the box and act independently but he must try or die.Critique: `Visioneer' is quite a unique movie and definitely not something for anyone in search of a light hearted, unchallenging viewing experience. This film has an uncanny ability to push a lot of emotional buttons most viewers would not want to be pushed. The heavy emotional angst dealt with in the film will slowly but surely begin to be felt by the audience and trigger a personal reaction to the storyline. Not only will you begin to question whether or not you're really happy, you'll begin to examine to what extent your own personal limitations prevent you from changing things for the better. Maybe I'm giving the film way too much credit, but it certainly elicited some strong responses from me.Despite what I've already said about the almost tangible angst emoted by the film and my strong emotional reaction to it I must also admit that 'Visioneer' has some discernible flaws; it pace is much too slow for most peoples taste and is a bit uneven at times. I was also somewhat disappointed by the ending. It much too upbeat, one of those happily ever after scenarios that just didn't fit with the overall message of the rest of the film.It's definitely not for everyone but well worth a watch if you're so inclined.",4,"""I've Been Dead Long Enough"" ~ Productivity, Happiness And Explosion Free Living",1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,2557,"['2010', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', 'film', 'Visioneer', 'starring', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'audience', 'vision', 'possible', 'dark', 'authoritarian', 'future', 'Be', 'prepared', 'powerful', 'clear', 'disturbingly', 'accurate', 'vision', 'world', 'self', 'awareness', 'purpose.Synopsis', 'dark', 'comedy', 'depressing', 'best', 'least', 'how', 'most', 'movie', 'Yes', 'truly', 'future', 'world', 'reason', 'exist', 'future', 'scheme', 'things', 'only', 'productivity', 'valued', 'individual', 'pursuit', 'excellence', 'friendship', 'love', 'anything', 'else', 'may', 'think', 'longer', 'meaning', 'have', 'become', 'rats', 'maze', 'nothing', 'more', 'loss', 'meaning', 'understated', 'confusion', 'thinly', 'guised', 'desperation', 'simple', 'exudes', 'screen', 'Laid', 'out', 'society', 'utter', 'pain', 'pain', 'exquisitely', 'displayed', 'face', 'film', 'star', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'man', 'explode', 'literally', 'what', 'people', 'do', 'when', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'stand', 'living', 'world', 'meaning', 'hero', 'reached', 'point', 'critical', 'mass', 'must', 'either', 'break', 'free', 'discover', 'personal', 'happiness', 'explode', ""n't"", 'easy', 'society', 'lost', 'ability', 'look', 'box', 'act', 'independently', 'must', 'try', 'die.Critique', 'Visioneer', 'quite', 'unique', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'something', 'anyone', 'search', 'light', 'hearted', 'unchallenging', 'viewing', 'experience', 'film', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'push', 'lot', 'emotional', 'buttons', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'pushed', 'heavy', 'emotional', 'angst', 'dealt', 'film', 'will', 'slowly', 'surely', 'begin', 'be', 'felt', 'audience', 'trigger', 'personal', 'reaction', 'storyline', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'begin', 'question', 'not', ""'re"", 'really', 'happy', ""'ll"", 'begin', 'examine', 'what', 'extent', 'own', 'personal', 'limitations', 'prevent', 'changing', 'things', 'better', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'certainly', 'elicited', 'strong', 'responses', 'me.Despite', 'what', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'almost', 'tangible', 'angst', 'emoted', 'film', 'strong', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'must', 'also', 'admit', ""'Visioneer"", 'discernible', 'flaws', 'pace', 'much', 'too', 'slow', 'most', 'peoples', 'taste', 'bit', 'uneven', 'times', 'was', 'also', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'much', 'too', 'upbeat', 'one', 'happily', 'ever', 'scenarios', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'overall', 'message', 'rest', 'film.It', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'well', 'watch', ""'re"", 'so', 'inclined']",Visioneers
1256435,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B002935GI2,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[6, 10]","It's rare that a film turns me off within its first few seconds.  In fact, I don't ever remember it happening before.  In 'Visioneers', the protagonist, George Washington Winsterhammerman, a descendent of the first president, is a level three visioneer in the mammoth Jeffers Corporation.  In the opening shot, he is entering his workspace - he pauses in front of the Jeffers company logo, greets the sign, and flips it the bird.This single action - no matter what its context - seems so sophomoric and puerile that it put the entire film into a hole out of which it was never able to climb.  That the hand gesture, in this minutes-into-the-future world, has lost its old meaning and is now a sign of camaraderie in the Jeffers workplace only makes it worse - by showcasing this ironic contrivance in the opening seconds of the film, the fraternal writer/director team of Jared and Brandon Drake reveal more about themselves than the setting of the film.  I know they are trying to be ironic - if, from my summary, it sounds witty, or clever, or edgy, then this may be a film for you.In the soulless world of 'Visioneers', the problem is unsatisfactory life amidst luxurious plenty.  The vast conglomerate of the Jeffers Corporation is working to eradicate all unhappiness, but without an unhappy yin to hang a happy yang on, people are little more than productive automatons.  The stress builds, and they respond by exploding - literally.  George Washington Winsterhammerman is beginning to show symptoms of exploding himself, which propels him on quest to recover his humanity.'Visioneers' is a satire of the modern corporate world, along with our consumer culture and society's tendency to avoid pain at all costs.  These are bona fide targets - but it seems to me that a successful satire should be a wake up call, an expos&eacute; of bloviating pretensions and hidden mechanics at work in a society.  I thought the idea of people exploding under stress was a good premise to wrap such a satire around, but the Drakes don't dig deep enough.  The result is a parade of routine observations - that the cubicle culture can be a stifling, creativity-killing environment; that corporations don't really have our best interests at heart; that personality cults are rather shallow and unfulfilling - the list goes on, but there are no insights or eye-opening revelations here that aren't already apparent to anyone paying attention.  Even so, it could still work as straight parody, except I found little to laugh at.Midway through the film, George's older brother, Julieen - a man who had at one time been even higher in the Jeffers Corporation's hierarchy than George had - throws away all his advantages and moves into George's pool house.  And takes up pole vaulting.  The sub-text is that the only way to keep from exploding in this world is to follow your dream.  Julieen becomes a cultish figure, and attracts a following that over time turns into a perpetual carnival - but he points out to George that even his followers don't get it.  They're doing the same as the cubicle crowd, except instead of sacrificing their dreams on the alter of commercial goods and slavish devotion to corporate America, they've laid theirs at the feet of hedonism.Fair enough, and by far the most astute perception in the film.  Except pursuing a dream implies hard work toward personal fulfillment - three quarters through the film, it becomes increasingly clear that George's dream is to abandon his family and track down a fantasy woman he constructed out of a voice on the phone.  The idea that true love conquers all has its place, I suppose, but George's course of action is nothing more than a selfish pursuit of another thing or person to make him feel better about himself, thereby skipping painful self-examination - which is exactly what the director has spent most of the film setting up for ridicule.Bed hopping must be one of the worst ways to avoid growth pains, and I can only assume lack of real world experience on the part of the filmmakers would make them think otherwise.  Unfortunately, in the artificial world of film, the drawbacks to this behavior are concealed behind swelling heart music and a fade-to-black before anyone has to suffer the consequences of their actions.  Of course, storytelling like this is common - it's comforting - but it seems as though the writer missed the point of his own story.  Chasing after our dreams may very well keep us from exploding, but dreaming of passion is a poor substitute for being passionate about a dream.",2,"Blind in One Eye, Can't See Out of the Other",1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,4562,"['rare', 'film', 'off', 'first', 'few', 'seconds', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'remember', 'happening', ""'Visioneers"", 'protagonist', 'George', 'Washington', 'Winsterhammerman', 'descendent', 'first', 'president', 'level', 'three', 'visioneer', 'mammoth', 'Jeffers', 'Corporation', 'opening', 'shot', 'entering', 'workspace', 'front', 'Jeffers', 'company', 'logo', 'sign', 'bird.This', 'single', 'action', 'matter', 'what', 'context', 'so', 'sophomoric', 'puerile', 'put', 'entire', 'film', 'hole', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'climb', 'hand', 'gesture', 'minutes-into-the-future', 'world', 'lost', 'old', 'meaning', 'now', 'sign', 'camaraderie', 'Jeffers', 'workplace', 'only', 'worse', 'showcasing', 'ironic', 'contrivance', 'opening', 'seconds', 'film', 'fraternal', 'writer/director', 'team', 'Jared', 'Brandon', 'Drake', 'reveal', 'more', 'setting', 'film', 'know', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'ironic', 'summary', 'witty', 'clever', 'edgy', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'you.In', 'soulless', 'world', ""'Visioneers"", 'problem', 'unsatisfactory', 'life', 'amidst', 'luxurious', 'plenty', 'vast', 'conglomerate', 'Jeffers', 'Corporation', 'working', 'eradicate', 'unhappiness', 'unhappy', 'yin', 'hang', 'happy', 'yang', 'people', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'productive', 'automatons', 'stress', 'builds', 'respond', 'exploding', 'literally', 'George', 'Washington', 'Winsterhammerman', 'beginning', 'show', 'symptoms', 'exploding', 'quest', 'recover', 'humanity', ""'Visioneers"", 'satire', 'modern', 'corporate', 'world', 'consumer', 'culture', 'society', 'tendency', 'avoid', 'pain', 'costs', 'are', 'bona', 'fide', 'targets', 'successful', 'satire', 'should', 'be', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'expos', 'eacute', 'bloviating', 'pretensions', 'hidden', 'mechanics', 'work', 'society', 'thought', 'idea', 'people', 'exploding', 'stress', 'was', 'good', 'premise', 'wrap', 'satire', 'Drakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'dig', 'deep', 'enough', 'result', 'parade', 'routine', 'observations', 'cubicle', 'culture', 'can', 'be', 'stifling', 'creativity-killing', 'environment', 'corporations', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'best', 'interests', 'heart', 'personality', 'cults', 'are', 'rather', 'shallow', 'unfulfilling', 'list', 'are', 'insights', 'eye-opening', 'revelations', 'here', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'apparent', 'anyone', 'paying', 'attention', 'Even', 'so', 'could', 'still', 'work', 'as', 'straight', 'parody', 'found', 'little', 'laugh', 'at.Midway', 'film', 'George', 'older', 'brother', 'Julieen', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'time', 'been', 'even', 'higher', 'Jeffers', 'Corporation', 'hierarchy', 'George', 'had', 'away', 'advantages', 'moves', 'George', 'pool', 'house', 'up', 'pole', 'vaulting', 'sub-text', 'only', 'way', 'keep', 'exploding', 'world', 'follow', 'dream', 'Julieen', 'cultish', 'figure', 'following', 'time', 'perpetual', 'carnival', 'out', 'George', 'even', 'followers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', ""'re"", 'doing', 'same', 'cubicle', 'crowd', 'instead', 'sacrificing', 'dreams', 'alter', 'commercial', 'goods', 'slavish', 'devotion', 'corporate', 'America', ""'ve"", 'laid', 'theirs', 'feet', 'hedonism.Fair', 'enough', 'far', 'most', 'astute', 'perception', 'film', 'pursuing', 'dream', 'hard', 'work', 'personal', 'fulfillment', 'three', 'quarters', 'film', 'increasingly', 'clear', 'George', 'dream', 'abandon', 'family', 'track', 'down', 'fantasy', 'woman', 'constructed', 'voice', 'phone', 'idea', 'true', 'love', 'conquers', 'place', 'suppose', 'George', 'course', 'action', 'nothing', 'more', 'selfish', 'pursuit', 'thing', 'person', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'thereby', 'skipping', 'painful', 'self-examination', 'exactly', 'what', 'director', 'spent', 'most', 'film', 'setting', 'up', 'ridicule.Bed', 'hopping', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'ways', 'avoid', 'growth', 'pains', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'lack', 'real', 'world', 'experience', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'make', 'think', 'otherwise', 'Unfortunately', 'artificial', 'world', 'film', 'drawbacks', 'behavior', 'are', 'concealed', 'swelling', 'heart', 'music', 'fade-to-black', 'anyone', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'actions', 'course', 'storytelling', 'common', 'comforting', 'writer', 'missed', 'point', 'own', 'story', 'Chasing', 'dreams', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'keep', 'exploding', 'dreaming', 'passion', 'poor', 'substitute', 'being', 'passionate', 'dream']",Visioneers

1256443,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B002935GI2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","As Jared Drake's ""Visioneers"" establishes its bleak portrait of the corporate world in a dystopian future, I loved the idea and premise behind the enterprise. Low-key, mundane, and loaded with banal monotony, the work day that Zach Galifianakis and his colleagues must endure as office drones is brought to life with exquisitely uncomfortable awkwardness. As the DVD cover suggests a marriage of Mike Judge's ""Office Space"" with Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"", it seems a relatively apt comparison from the film world--but Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" also seems to be a relevant influence. But taking these great cues and starting with a winning hand, it soon becomes clear (especially in the film's second half) that the screenplay really doesn't know where to go. It's a shame, too--I was rooting for this to be a little undiscovered gem--but I started watching this with three friends and by the end, only I remained. Billed as a black comedy, anyone expecting a riotous and laugh-out-loud film should check their expectations before proceeding.Galifianakis works for the renowned Jessups Corporation--headed with great comedic aplomb by D.W. Moffett. Preaching happy thoughts and productivity, the office has become a mind numbing existence. His discontent wife (the always reliable Judy Greer) seeks solace and comfort from a book on happiness and current fads to fill her empty days. And his brother (a spry James LeGros), recently released from prison, takes up residence in his backyard and is soon leading a movement to endorse freedom of expression. In a land where critical thought and feelings are frowned upon, it's not easy to get by. When people start to explode, literally, from boredom and repressed emotion--it serves as a catalyst to reevaluate life.The office scenes can be quite amusing initially--although you have to be careful expressing boredom cinematically because sometimes it can come off as boring. There are frequently static scenes of characters staring expressionlessly into space for extended time periods. I really loved Greer and the skewering of media related culture. I'm a fan of all the principle actors, but after a bit--they seemed to get stranded. LeGros' sub-plot, in particular, builds in bizarre ways without much narrative clarity. The movie veers into a more realistic territory (the uncorrupted country) where our hero attempts to make an actual human connection with his dream girl. I didn't much care for this gentler world and don't feel it integrated particularly well with the rest of the film. The ending, for me, was completely unsatisfying as well. On the plus side, the film is different and some of the cast is appealing (those that aren't completely lifeless). On the negative side, pacing will be an issue to many. I didn't mind that as much as the film had no follow-through from its intriguing premise. A good start just sort of continuously wound down into nothingness for me.

It works too well in this idiot culture and if I have to watch one more movie champion this ignorance I will puke.  Especially one that over achieves at boring me to death.  The only way to avoid manipulation is to understand manipulation.  Anyone that thinks they think for themselves because they were reinforced for thinking differently then others is a sheep.  Every human brain evolved to behave according to the contingencies of reinforcement.  This independent thought illusion plays right in the hands of this culture and causes every problem this film embodies.  We have to learn to replace aversive controls with positive controls and learn everyone is a completely unique individual and we have to adapt for each person to have them feel good.  Not everyone likes chocolate, some have eaten too much chocolate, some get tired of chocolate and some people never want to feel like they are controlled.  I certainly don't want to feel controlled and I therefore despise propoganda movies like this one and recommend we observe what works and then do what works and adapt when necessary.
