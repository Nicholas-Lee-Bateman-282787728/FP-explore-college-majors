1693105,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00I01FUBA,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 5]","It's hard to imagine, but I think Uwe Boll is actually getting worse.Yes, yes, Boll is considered one of the worst directors of all time... but at least his movies like ""Bloodrayne"" and ""In the Name of the King"" used to be entertainingly bad, with faster pacing and miserable-looking name actors. Ever since Germany closed a certain tax-shelter loophole, his movies have devolved into cheap, tedious affairs that appear to have been funded by a six-year-old's lemonade stand. ""In The Name of the King 3: The Last Mission"" is one of these.The story follows an American hit man with a silly name, Hazen Kaine (Dominic Purcell), who (for some reason) is working for a Bulgarian crimelord. He kidnaps a couple of girls and shuts them in a shipping container, then is sucked centuries into the past.... where, fortunately, medieval Bulgarians speak fluent English with a thick accent. A couple of young women, Arabella (Ralitsa Paskaleva) and Sophie (Petra Gocheva) rescue him from a rampaging dragon, and identify him by a tattoo on his arm as a chosen hero.Confused? You're going to stay that way, because the tattoo is never actually explained. He got it in L.A., it happens to be the mystical symbol of a magical amulet... and that's all we have.So it turns out that the young women are trying to take down an evil king who can't afford to hire guards or buy shirts, because he killed their father. Kaine is not particularly invested in this, but he's informed that he cannot go home until he helps them take down the Designated Villain. And so, they gather an army of about two dozen guys to defeat the Evil King and his ten or twelve ninjas.""In The Name of the King 3: The Last Mission"" reeks of unenthusiasm. The most obvious example is Dominic Purcell, who looks like he would rather be ANYWHERE doing ANYTHING ELSE -- he looks even less invested than Dolph Lundgren did in the preceding movie. And I seriously wonder if Lundgren was drunk the whole time. Purcell simply drifts through every scene, mumbling in a monotone and looking intensely bored.The rest of the cast is Bulgarian, and I'm not entirely sure that they knew what they were saying -- they utter ridiculous lines with a complete lack of passion, possibly because they're almost unintelligible when they raise their voices. It feels less like Boll hired actual actors, and more like he plucked random Bulgarians off the street (it's cheap to film there) and cast them in his movie.And while Boll's movies are absurdly bad at best, this is both bad and tedious. This feels like someone decided to film a really depressing, lifeless larp -- bad CGI dragon, dozens of dangling plot threads, fight scenes that are hideously amateurish (jerk the camera around! Don't bother having the weapons connect with the people they're killing!) and rickety medieval villages and ruined castles.At first, it's fun to make fun of the illogic (yes, hide from a dragon inside a TINY WOODEN HOUSE) and the poor acting. But eventually it gets downright depressing -- for instance, it's hinted that the magical amulet can control the dragon, who is in this movie for REASON NOT EXPLAINED. Yet when the amulet is near the dragon in the present day.... nobody even tries to use it.And funnily, the fight with Evil King is not the climax -- presumably because the movie would be too short. No, the climax involves a dragon doggedly pursuing Kaine through a modern city, then mysteriously losing interest in him once it has killed one of the villains. Yes, the movie ends with a dragon loose in a modern city... and nobody seems to care. Least of all Boll.Hopefully, ""In the Name of the King 3: The Last Mission"" WILL be the last mission, because this no-budget embarrassment should be forgotten as soon as possible. Dominic Purcell will probably thank you for that.",1,Time travel... again (small spoilers),1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,3808,"['hard', 'imagine', 'think', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'actually', 'getting', 'worse.Yes', 'yes', 'Boll', 'considered', 'one', 'worst', 'directors', 'time', 'least', 'movies', 'Bloodrayne', 'Name', 'King', 'used', 'be', 'entertainingly', 'bad', 'faster', 'pacing', 'miserable-looking', 'name', 'actors', 'Ever', 'Germany', 'closed', 'certain', 'tax-shelter', 'loophole', 'movies', 'have', 'devolved', 'cheap', 'tedious', 'affairs', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'funded', 'six-year-old', 'lemonade', 'stand', 'Name', 'King', '3', 'Last', 'Mission', 'one', 'these.The', 'story', 'American', 'hit', 'man', 'silly', 'name', 'Hazen', 'Kaine', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'who', 'reason', 'working', 'Bulgarian', 'crimelord', 'couple', 'girls', 'shipping', 'container', 'then', 'sucked', 'centuries', 'past', 'where', 'fortunately', 'medieval', 'Bulgarians', 'speak', 'fluent', 'English', 'thick', 'accent', 'couple', 'young', 'women', 'Arabella', 'Ralitsa', 'Paskaleva', 'Sophie', 'Petra', 'Gocheva', 'rescue', 'rampaging', 'dragon', 'identify', 'tattoo', 'arm', 'chosen', 'hero.Confused', ""'re"", 'going', 'stay', 'way', 'tattoo', 'never', 'actually', 'explained', 'got', 'L.A.', 'be', 'mystical', 'symbol', 'magical', 'amulet', 'have.So', 'out', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'trying', 'take', 'down', 'evil', 'king', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'hire', 'guards', 'buy', 'shirts', 'killed', 'father', 'Kaine', 'not', 'particularly', 'invested', 'informed', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'home', 'take', 'down', 'Designated', 'Villain', 'so', 'gather', 'army', 'about', 'two', 'dozen', 'guys', 'defeat', 'Evil', 'King', 'ten', 'twelve', 'ninjas', 'Name', 'King', '3', 'Last', 'Mission', 'reeks', 'unenthusiasm', 'most', 'obvious', 'example', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'ANYWHERE', 'doing', 'ANYTHING', 'ELSE', 'even', 'less', 'invested', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'did', 'preceding', 'movie', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'Lundgren', 'was', 'drunk', 'whole', 'time', 'Purcell', 'simply', 'scene', 'mumbling', 'monotone', 'looking', 'intensely', 'bored.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'Bulgarian', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'utter', 'ridiculous', 'lines', 'complete', 'lack', 'passion', 'possibly', ""'re"", 'almost', 'unintelligible', 'when', 'raise', 'voices', 'less', 'Boll', 'hired', 'actual', 'actors', 'more', 'plucked', 'random', 'Bulgarians', 'street', 'cheap', 'film', 'there', 'cast', 'movie.And', 'Boll', 'movies', 'are', 'absurdly', 'bad', 'best', 'bad', 'tedious', 'feels', 'someone', 'decided', 'film', 'really', 'depressing', 'lifeless', 'larp', 'bad', 'CGI', 'dragon', 'dozens', 'dangling', 'plot', 'threads', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'hideously', 'amateurish', 'jerk', 'camera', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'having', 'weapons', 'connect', 'people', ""'re"", 'killing', 'rickety', 'medieval', 'villages', 'ruined', 'castles.At', 'first', 'fun', 'make', 'fun', 'illogic', 'yes', 'hide', 'dragon', 'TINY', 'WOODEN', 'HOUSE', 'poor', 'acting', 'eventually', 'downright', 'depressing', 'instance', 'hinted', 'magical', 'amulet', 'can', 'control', 'dragon', 'who', 'movie', 'REASON', 'NOT', 'EXPLAINED', 'when', 'amulet', 'dragon', 'present', 'day', 'nobody', 'even', 'use', 'it.And', 'funnily', 'fight', 'Evil', 'King', 'not', 'climax', 'presumably', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'short', 'No', 'climax', 'dragon', 'doggedly', 'pursuing', 'Kaine', 'modern', 'city', 'then', 'mysteriously', 'losing', 'interest', 'once', 'killed', 'one', 'villains', 'Yes', 'movie', 'dragon', 'loose', 'modern', 'city', 'nobody', 'care', 'Least', 'Boll.Hopefully', 'Name', 'King', '3', 'Last', 'Mission', 'be', 'last', 'mission', 'no-budget', 'embarrassment', 'should', 'be', 'forgotten', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'will', 'probably', 'thank']",N/A

He is a hitman in Bulgaria and is given one last job before he retires, and that is to kill the two young daughters of Bulgarian royalty. He kidnaps them and locks them in a sealand. He takes from the older girl a medallion, one that matches a forearm tattoo he got in California. The next thing you know he is transported back into time...a time in Bulgarian history when they had a fire breathing dragon and spoke modern English with Eastern European accents.He discovers that because of a tattoo which his now dead wife liked, he is destined to lead an army against the bad guys, fend off a dragon, and oh yea, there are these princesses babes with swords, the older of which doesn't like him.
