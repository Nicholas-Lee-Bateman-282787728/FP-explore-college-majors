702085,A2HGET34VBQPIK,B000067D8W,"Amazon Customer ""starscroll""","[12, 13]","This disc containing the first 2 episodes of the series have been combined to play as a movie length episode which follows how it was played on television as a repeat. The advantages of watching this exclusive Canadian import - where the series is filmed - are the extra features and the pleasure of being able to watch it over and over without degradation. I'm interested in hearing the audio commentaries and would really like to see some outtakes or deleted scenes on the disc.The fact that this DVD has come out so soon after the show first aired is something in itself, since the first season has only just finished airing on TV.The cool thing about the show are the great special effects which are in ample supply in about every episode and the very likeable young cast. The first of which I had seen of 2 of it's cast members - Tom Welling (Clark Kent) and Kristen Kreuk (Lana Lang). Michael Rosenbaum is also great as Lex Luthor. The Theme song ""Save Me"" by Remy Zero is also a great choice for such a show as Clark ends up saving at least 1 person in each episode.After watching this movie it will be easy to get hooked to the show. One stand-out scene in particular involves the meteor shower at the start. All-in-all I think the mix of drama, humour, special effects and the great looking cast all combine to make this show one that will appeal to all age groups.I'll be looking forward to when they have the whole series on DVD as I'll be one of the first people to buy it...",5,This is easily my favourite TV show!,1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,1487,"['disc', 'containing', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'combined', 'play', 'movie', 'length', 'episode', 'how', 'was', 'played', 'television', 'repeat', 'advantages', 'watching', 'exclusive', 'Canadian', 'import', 'where', 'series', 'filmed', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'pleasure', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'degradation', ""'m"", 'interested', 'hearing', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'disc.The', 'fact', 'DVD', 'come', 'out', 'so', 'soon', 'show', 'first', 'aired', 'something', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'just', 'finished', 'airing', 'TV.The', 'cool', 'thing', 'show', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'ample', 'supply', 'episode', 'very', 'likeable', 'young', 'cast', 'first', 'had', 'seen', '2', 'cast', 'members', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'also', 'great', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Theme', 'song', 'Save', 'Me', 'Remy', 'Zero', 'also', 'great', 'choice', 'show', 'Clark', 'up', 'saving', 'least', '1', 'person', 'episode.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'get', 'hooked', 'show', 'One', 'stand-out', 'scene', 'particular', 'involves', 'meteor', 'shower', 'start', 'All-in-all', 'think', 'mix', 'drama', 'humour', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'looking', 'cast', 'combine', 'make', 'show', 'one', 'will', 'appeal', 'age', 'groups.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'when', 'have', 'whole', 'series', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'first', 'people', 'buy']",Smallville

702087,A1YP6SXB3IU6WS,B000067D8W,"Jack Mueller ""Jack""","[5, 67]","Let me ask that age-old question; can this get any dumber? More than likely yes. The show could bring in yet another pathetic teenager who has been infected by the meteor rocks and goes down in another pathetic stand off against the incredible dull and loser Clark Kent. Need I say more???How about a history lesson?Clark Kent is not actually real, but a disguise to hide the identity of Superman. He came to earth as a baby (NOT a toddler) to survive the destruction of his home planet Krypton. He grows up as a farm boy in the town of Smallville where his powers appear and mature. He has no friends, (no Chloe, no Pete, and especially not a young Lex Luther) but there is a Lana Lang who is his love interest. He can never be with her because she can never know his secret. Clark grows into a young man and then assuming the role of Superboy where he deals with foes with extraordinary powers that come from outer space, other dimensions, and areas OUTSIDE of Smallville. That us when he becomes brief friends with Lex Luther and fatal disaster destroys their relationship and thus becoming enemies. Finally as he becomes a man, his destiny is complete by taking up the role as Superman. In order to fit into society he disguises himself once again as a news reporter for The Metropolis Daily Planet and meets his true love Louis Lane. And still the foes come stronger and harder then ever, even the dreaded Doomsday. Thus there is the life of Superman WHO BECOMES Clark Kent.SEASON ONE: Toddler Ka-El comes to Earth during a meteor shower and grows up into high school freshman Clark Kent. (Who looks like he's been held back for four years along with everyone else attending Smallville High) He learns of his origins and deals with special powers that arise which help him with the lame and everyday events. They also help him deal with troubled residents who have been affected by meteor rocks and keeps on screwing up his chances of getting a girlfriend with either the beautiful Lana Lang or his friend the article writer Chloe. After saving the life of a Lex Luthor whom is in his twenties, Clark becomes best friends with him, which only complicates the burden of keeping his powers and origins a secret.The only thing that this season had going for it was cute young women and an okay soundtrack. The crisis that arise become so repetitive that you just wished they would stop showing up, but then you'd have to watch an hour of a teenager and his friends hanging out trying to hide their true feelings from another. The special effects are cool but that's all that matters to these days now isn't it?SEASON TWO: More of Clark's powers surface to help him do battle against pathetic threats and his friendships either grew or slowly begin to fall apart.Once again this show is very repetitive and only has pretty women, a good soundtrack, and cool special effects going for it. You keep finding yourself wanting to scream; ""JUST PUT CLARK AND LANA TOGETHER SINCE YOU'VE KILLED THE STORY OF SUPERMAN!"" At least Christopher Reeves makes an appearance but his part is so boring you've got to wonder how much the show paid him to be in it. The finale is interesting because Jor-El finally shows up and demands Clark to face his destiny.SEASON THREE: After fighting his addiction to red kryptonite, Clark returns to Smallville to try to fix and pick things back up with Lana.The premiere was okay because it was dealing with Superman ideas, and so was the episode where a drunken Perry White makes a stop in Smallville for the same reason. Other than that, things are the same for the story line and the effects. Once again Christopher Reeves makes an appearance, which is just beyond me knowing why. This season was the most disappointing of all because the viewer was expecting Clark to at least become Superboy, which he never did. Jor-El calls Clark home and the finale ends there.SEASON FOUR: All that can be said is that it returns in September and a young Louis Lane comes into play.Hopefully when Clark returns from the Krypton dimension, he will assume the role of Superboy. (That's probably asking too much though isn't it?) This show should have been canceled long ago during the first season and should have been an embarrassment to everyone involved, but I guess everyone is on drugs. What the writers and creators don't get is; Superman is always Superman, he can never stop being him. Clark Kent is just a disguise to hide that fact. This show is not about Superman and sadly it's not even about Superboy. It's about a boy named Clark Kent, who has a Jonathan and Martha Kent as parents, has a friend named Lex Luthor, lives in a town named Smallville, and just happens to have super powers that helps him in a crisis, but the show is not about Superman or Superboy. I am disgusted to see the Superman emblem on this show.",1,Can You Say Superman?

702088,A3OIDHXKZ74MU0,B000067D8W,Neil,"[0, 0]","At first the idea of another Roswell/Buffy with a superhero twist doesn't exactly bode well for a genre that is already being done to death in the marketplace.  So it was with no small amount of apprehension that I found myself viewing the pilot episode of Smallville one sunday afternoon on UK Television.  Although familiar with the comics I was and am no big Superman fan yet within 20 minutes the show had me in thrall and I thought - Jesus, this is actually a good show.  Sure the X-Files villian of the week idea couldn't work forever but that soon became secondary to the characterisation that the writers and actors bring to this show.  Clark alone is a contradiction of Freudian proportions - strong yet insecure, handsome but lonely, secretive (out of necessity regarding his powers) yet warm and open.  And then their are his parents - brilliantly portrayed by veterans Annette O'Toole and John Schneider who provide a caring and supportive backbone to Clarks 'different' adolescence.  But out of all the characters none holds the show quite so well as Lex Luthor played by Michael Rosenbaum.  In direct contrast to Clark, he is the one character that we all know will one day become the villian of the show and yet you cannot help but feel sympathetic to Lex.  Michael Rosenbaum brings an overwhelming humanity to the show that stems from Lex being unloved by his father and the unenviable position of outsider as a result of this and the meteor crash that left him bald.  My upbringing was similiar to Clarks but in one episode when you see Lex stare at Clark and his family hugging after a life threatening incident you can't help but feel his pain and envy.  Yes it is that good a show - even the coldest heart will find comfort here.  The DVD is a nice transfer and the extras a pleasant surprise considering Warner normally limit such things especially on TV Show DVD's (Babylon 5 The Gathering springs to mind!).  The commentary is a bit dull though with little given away, instead the creators just rehash what the viewer could gleam from watching the pilot themselves.  Perhaps if they release the first season as a box set (the smart money says they will) the actors themselves could do the commentary as I'm sure this would be more entertaining.  Saying that its a nice little DVD and exclusive to canada as well.

I've seen every single episode of ""Smallville"" since Day One, so I can easily say that this was one of the best new series on TV...despite the fact that it's a ""teen show"". A lot of critics tried to compare ""Smallville"" to ""Alias"" and said that ""Alias"" was better (later on during the season, after they had already said at the beginning that ""Smallville"" would be a great show), but I also saw ""Alias"" and I have to say that I enjoyed ""Smallville"" a lot more--and I was never even a huge fan of Superman!""Smallville"" is a show about the teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling), living in Smallville, Kansas and who will someday grow up into Superman. But for now, he is trying to fit in with the normal human being life of a teenager...all while trying to win over the girl of his dreams, Lana Lang (formally known as Lois Lang in the Superman comics and movies), played by Kristin Kreuk. Then there's the rich Lex Luther (Michael Rosenbaum), who is friends with Clark but also trying to find out how Clark saved him when he hit Clark while driving and crashed into a river in the Pilot Episode, which you will find on this disc. Lana is also going out with this guy named Whitney (Eric Johnson), who later in the show becomes so-so friends with Clark when they start to trust each other. Clark lives with his parents (played by Annete O'Tool and John Schinder, I think that's how you spell their names) on the Kent Farm and Clark has two best friends, Chloe and Pete.In every episode, you watch Clark Kent save at least one person from the ""ultimate danger"". Every episode gets more and more interesting, until you get hooked on the show and can't stop watching it (that's what happened to me!). The entire cast are all very talented, and the screenwriting is excellent. The special effects are also quite amazing, too. And Tom Welling is very hot, and even more hot when he takes his shirt off! So besides this cast being very talented, there's also some great ""eye-candy"", too.As for this disc, it contains the full ""Pilot"" episode and the second episode, which is called ""Metamorphisis"". It's a Canadian Import so you can only buy it from Amazon.com, but if you love the show then it'll be well-worth it. I hope this means that ""Smallville"" will get ""complete seasons of"" DVD box sets, but they'll be released here in the United States, too. I can't wait for next season because ""Smallville"" is the best new show on TV. If you haven't seen it yet then you are seriously missing out! I highly recommend this DVD to all fans of the show and to those who didn't catch the show but would like to try it to see if it's your cup of tea. But trust me...all the better episodes come on later during the season, so don't just judge by the first two episodes!",5,"Does this mean ""complete seasons of"" DVDs?!",1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,2826,"['would', 'be', 'great', 'even', 'Smallville', 'just', 'ended', 'first', 'season', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'Smallville', 'Day', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'new', 'series', 'TV', 'fact', 'teen', 'show', 'lot', 'critics', 'tried', 'compare', 'Smallville', 'Alias', 'said', 'Alias', 'was', 'better', 'later', 'season', 'had', 'already', 'said', 'beginning', 'Smallville', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'show', 'also', 'saw', 'Alias', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Smallville', 'lot', 'more', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'huge', 'fan', 'Superman', 'Smallville', 'show', 'teenage', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'living', 'Smallville', 'Kansas', 'who', 'will', 'someday', 'grow', 'up', 'Superman', 'now', 'trying', 'fit', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'life', 'teenager', 'trying', 'win', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'formally', 'known', 'Lois', 'Lang', 'Superman', 'comics', 'movies', 'played', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Then', 'rich', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'who', 'friends', 'Clark', 'also', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Clark', 'saved', 'when', 'hit', 'Clark', 'driving', 'crashed', 'river', 'Pilot', 'Episode', 'will', 'find', 'disc', 'Lana', 'also', 'going', 'out', 'guy', 'named', 'Whitney', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'who', 'later', 'show', 'so-so', 'friends', 'Clark', 'when', 'start', 'trust', 'other', 'Clark', 'parents', 'played', 'Annete', ""O'Tool"", 'John', 'Schinder', 'think', 'how', 'spell', 'names', 'Kent', 'Farm', 'Clark', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Chloe', 'Pete.In', 'episode', 'watch', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'save', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'ultimate', 'danger', 'episode', 'more', 'more', 'interesting', 'get', 'hooked', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'what', 'happened', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'very', 'talented', 'screenwriting', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'amazing', 'too', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'very', 'hot', 'even', 'more', 'hot', 'when', 'shirt', 'off', 'So', 'cast', 'being', 'very', 'talented', 'also', 'great', 'eye-candy', 'too.As', 'disc', 'full', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'second', 'episode', 'called', 'Metamorphisis', 'Canadian', 'Import', 'can', 'only', 'buy', 'Amazon.com', 'love', 'show', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'well-worth', 'hope', 'Smallville', 'will', 'get', 'complete', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', ""'ll"", 'be', 'released', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'season', 'Smallville', 'best', 'new', 'show', 'TV', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'then', 'are', 'seriously', 'missing', 'out', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'fans', 'show', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'show', 'would', 'like', 'try', 'see', 'cup', 'tea', 'better', 'episodes', 'come', 'later', 'season', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'judge', 'first', 'two', 'episodes']",Smallville

My only misgivings about it is that the video transfer for season 1 seems a little poor.

702094,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000067D8W,Simon,"[9, 9]","WB's new top-rated show, Smallville, has finally hit DVD! For those who are a bit fuzzy on the details, the show revolves around the teenage years of Clark Kent, whose destiny eventually leads him to become Superman. I'm not completely sure of the specs of the disc, but appearantly it includes the Pilot episode and the second episode (Metamorphisis), a deleted scene from the Pilot episode, an audio commentary by the producers, and an interactive map of Smallville.Admittedly, these two early episodes don't represent the best of what Smallville has to offer. Critics who think of the show as a Buffy/Dawson's Creek clone will have plenty to pick on here: we get a homecoming dance, teen angst over the girl next door (Lana Lang, played by an amazingly beautiful Kristen Kreuk)a 'freak of the week' who can control electricity (and later another one in the 'bugboy' vein), actors way too old to be in high school, and a typical 'Buffy-esque' plot: Boy likes girl. Girl has jealous jock boyfriend. Jealous jock boyfriend strings up boy in cornfield with kryptonite draped around his neck. And yes, the ending is overly sentimental and melodramatic, but like all hollywood teen flicks, it'll still manage to break your heart.However, the show still offers plenty of good stuff, for both newcomers and devoted Superman fans. The interaction between the characters are dead on, as is casting. The guy from the Dukes of Hazzard and Lana Lang from 'Superman III' (sorry, I can't spell their names) are perfect as Clark's parents. Tom Welling, Clark Kent, besides being a great actor, resembles previous Supermen Dean Cain and Christopher Reeve, and carries on the torch well. You'll forget about how old Welling really is five minutes into the story. Perhaps the show's riskest gamble, introducing a young Lex Luthor as Clark's big-brother/mentor, is it's biggest payoff. Michael Rosenbaum steals the show as Lex Luthor, and the show does a great job playing on the irony of his friendship with Clark.There are also several Superman references for fans, as is the norm with each episode. Be on the lookout for Clark in a symbolic red Superman cape, and the familiar 'S' shield in the most unlikely of situations.I highly recommend this disc. While the episodes are somewhat weak, the quality of the show has increased with almost every episode, and there's still enough goodies in here to warrant a look. Heres to hoping Smallville will be a very successful series.",4,"Before the fight for truth, justice, and the American way...",1022630400,"05 29, 2002",2002,2462,"['WB', 'new', 'top-rated', 'show', 'Smallville', 'finally', 'hit', 'DVD', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'details', 'show', 'teenage', 'years', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'destiny', 'eventually', 'become', 'Superman', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'specs', 'disc', 'appearantly', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'second', 'episode', 'Metamorphisis', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'audio', 'commentary', 'producers', 'interactive', 'map', 'Smallville.Admittedly', 'two', 'early', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'represent', 'best', 'what', 'Smallville', 'offer', 'Critics', 'who', 'think', 'show', 'Buffy/Dawson', 'Creek', 'clone', 'will', 'have', 'plenty', 'pick', 'here', 'get', 'homecoming', 'dance', 'teen', 'angst', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'played', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', ""'freak"", 'week', 'who', 'can', 'control', 'electricity', 'later', 'one', ""'bugboy"", 'vein', 'actors', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'typical', ""'Buffy-esque"", 'plot', 'Boy', 'girl', 'Girl', 'jealous', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'Jealous', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'up', 'boy', 'cornfield', 'kryptonite', 'draped', 'neck', 'yes', 'ending', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'melodramatic', 'hollywood', 'teen', 'flicks', ""'ll"", 'still', 'manage', 'break', 'heart.However', 'show', 'still', 'plenty', 'good', 'stuff', 'newcomers', 'devoted', 'Superman', 'fans', 'interaction', 'characters', 'are', 'dead', 'casting', 'guy', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Lana', 'Lang', ""'Superman"", 'III', 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spell', 'names', 'are', 'perfect', 'Clark', 'parents', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'being', 'great', 'actor', 'previous', 'Supermen', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'torch', 'well', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'how', 'old', 'Welling', 'really', 'five', 'minutes', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'show', 'riskest', 'gamble', 'introducing', 'young', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Clark', 'big-brother/mentor', 'biggest', 'payoff', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'show', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'show', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'irony', 'friendship', 'Clark.There', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'Superman', 'references', 'fans', 'norm', 'episode', 'Be', 'lookout', 'Clark', 'symbolic', 'red', 'Superman', 'cape', 'familiar', 'shield', 'most', 'unlikely', 'situations.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'disc', 'episodes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'quality', 'show', 'increased', 'almost', 'episode', 'still', 'enough', 'goodies', 'here', 'warrant', 'look', 'hoping', 'Smallville', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'successful', 'series']",Smallville
