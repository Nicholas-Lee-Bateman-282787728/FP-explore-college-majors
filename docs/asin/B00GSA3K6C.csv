1680349,A16TTO0XISBJF0,B00GSA3K6C,Budas Root,"[3, 8]","The erotic tension in this film gets like a steambath at times, as two powerbroker alpha males discover a mutual and natural attraction in the middle of the swanky L.A. advertising office where they both work.  So how will these porcupines mate?  Very, very carefully... at first.  Then oh so passionately.This film really tells it like it is when you a man who loves, wants, needs and defends another man.  If you aren't gay you won't get this film at all, it will seem frivolous or tedious, or amateurish.  If you are gay it's like when The Wizard of Oz goes color midway thru.  And the actors will even seem touched by the clumsy poignant grace of Bresson's people.So this prompts my little routine on the Great Awakenings based on the Poe-ish pendulum swings of l'histoire.  We are currently in the Fifth Great Awakening of Gay Male Consciousness.  There have been four previous ones.  The first came during the ancient Greek and Roman times, and was dealt its fatal blow by the Visigoths who ushered down several centuries of darkness and brutality and various cruel and unusual punishments for the love of god.  The second great awakening was in the 17th century, Foucault did much to excavate the casual gender laxness of that period; but it came to an end with the serious men of the Enlightenment, the pursuit of empires far and wide, and the dreary churchiness of Victoriana.  The third great awakening was in the 1920s, and we know what happened there.  Adolph Hitler; say no more.  The fourth great awakening was in the 1960s and it lasted for about fifteen some years before AIDS struck.This is the Fifth Great Awakening of Gay Male Consciousness.  Films like this one and Triple Crossed and the ones that Franco is contributing (the brother's not gay, tho) and Carter and Calson and all the other brave, tender artists newly tongues untied and rarin' to go are laying out ex-act-ly what it's like to be a gay man.  Cutting thru the b.s.  Taking off the uniforms to show the manly beating of gayhearts.  And if these films strike some as misogynistic (and they will), it's because we as gay men are stepping out from the shadow of women.  We have invested women with our longing, our envy, our shame at letting them down somehow, and our lack of freedom.  We have suffered the heartbreak of losing closeted gays to women again and again.  Imagining a gay male world is to imagine a world largely without women, godspeed them in their own battles for liberation but their battles are not ours and our battles are not theirs.  Sometimes we will even have to fight our battles over and against womanism and feminism, and they as well.  The consciousness that identifies a specific group cannot exist in the shadow and shackles of the consciousness of a different specific group.  The &#34;united front&#34; of gays and women against patriarchy and heterosexism has been more or less a convenient lie of academic queer-theory orthodoxy.  It never withstood the light of day...  Or rather, we see enough light at the end of that tunnel now that we can define an interpenetrative consciousness that is proudly male, proudly sexual, and proudly gay.So, gay men, enjoy this Fifth Great Awakening while it lasts, however long that is, because if l'histoire teaches us anything it's that it will be dark, dire, dirty and worse on the other side.

1680350,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00GSA3K6C,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 3]","This is a gay romance and like all romances there are star-crossed lovers who must overcome barriers, obstacles, and challenges to reach each other. Being a romance, the primary focus is on the lovers, in this case two young men who work for the same advertising company, and thus other characters in the film have as their function the ability to hinder the romance or facilitate it or to be the friend to whom the protagonists open their hearts and thus open their hearts to the viewers of the film.Well this film is pure romance and for those who wish to see handsome men overcoming obstacles, including their own prejudices and self-definitions, to find each other, then this is the film for you.Steve Miller, an ex-policeman turned advertising man, is played well by Eric Presnall. Steve finds himself in competition with a bright, ambitious, dashing young man, Mark Richfield, played well by Gregor Cosgrove.  These two men are very handsome in very different ways. Presnall is very all-American with a short blond haircut and a military look. Cosgrove, with his long hair and compact muscular body, is a great physical compliment to Presnall. One thing I cannot understand is why the producers of the film would use a basically unflattering photograph of these two men on the cover. Presnall has a scowl and Cosgrove is squinting into the sun. There were so many other images of these two men together that are more revealing of the beauty of these two guys.The film is about 90 minutes long. In truth, I felt it could have been improved a bit if it had been 2 hours long which would have allowed more conversation and process to occur which I think the film needed. One example is that Steve has self identified as a heterosexual and has had an African American girlfriend. As he realizes he is in love with Mark, wishes to continue a sexual relationship with him, he then must come in terms with his sexual orientation. This process of weighing his past sexual and romantic attachments to women and his current obsessions, both romantic and sexual, with a man all takes place while he is in an automatic car wash. The symbolism seems to be that his old past is being washed away. However a bit more process would have been welcomed. The same observation must be made for the character of Mark Richfield, a man engaged to a woman, who must navigate even more barriers than Steve to find the right person for him in life.I enjoyed the film, I was entertained, I am always happy when two people who seem right for each other find each other.",4,A gay romance where Romeo fights with Romeo until Romeo loves Romeo,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,2547,"['gay', 'romance', 'romances', 'are', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'who', 'must', 'overcome', 'barriers', 'obstacles', 'challenges', 'reach', 'other', 'Being', 'romance', 'primary', 'focus', 'lovers', 'case', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'work', 'same', 'advertising', 'company', 'thus', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'function', 'ability', 'hinder', 'romance', 'facilitate', 'be', 'friend', 'whom', 'protagonists', 'open', 'hearts', 'thus', 'open', 'hearts', 'viewers', 'film.Well', 'film', 'pure', 'romance', 'who', 'wish', 'see', 'handsome', 'men', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'including', 'own', 'prejudices', 'self-definitions', 'find', 'other', 'then', 'film', 'you.Steve', 'Miller', 'ex-policeman', 'turned', 'advertising', 'man', 'played', 'well', 'Eric', 'Presnall', 'Steve', 'competition', 'bright', 'ambitious', 'dashing', 'young', 'man', 'Mark', 'Richfield', 'played', 'well', 'Gregor', 'Cosgrove', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'very', 'handsome', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'Presnall', 'very', 'all-American', 'short', 'blond', 'haircut', 'military', 'look', 'Cosgrove', 'long', 'hair', 'compact', 'muscular', 'body', 'great', 'physical', 'compliment', 'Presnall', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'producers', 'film', 'would', 'use', 'basically', 'unflattering', 'photograph', 'two', 'men', 'cover', 'Presnall', 'scowl', 'Cosgrove', 'squinting', 'sun', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'images', 'two', 'men', 'together', 'are', 'more', 'revealing', 'beauty', 'two', 'guys.The', 'film', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'truth', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'bit', 'had', 'been', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'more', 'conversation', 'process', 'occur', 'think', 'film', 'needed', 'One', 'example', 'Steve', 'self', 'identified', 'heterosexual', 'had', 'African', 'American', 'girlfriend', 'love', 'Mark', 'continue', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'then', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'process', 'weighing', 'past', 'sexual', 'romantic', 'attachments', 'women', 'current', 'obsessions', 'romantic', 'sexual', 'man', 'place', 'automatic', 'car', 'wash', 'symbolism', 'be', 'old', 'past', 'being', 'washed', 'away', 'However', 'bit', 'more', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcomed', 'same', 'observation', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'character', 'Mark', 'Richfield', 'man', 'engaged', 'woman', 'who', 'must', 'navigate', 'even', 'more', 'barriers', 'Steve', 'find', 'right', 'person', 'life.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'entertained', 'am', 'always', 'happy', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'right', 'other', 'find', 'other']",Capital Games the Movie

1680356,A11F5KW6QXHL8L,B00GSA3K6C,Lasha,"[27, 29]","I think someone's enjoyment of this movie will depend on two things: one, how much you love the Gay For You trope; and two, how much you can tolerate cheating, as one of the main characters is engaged...to a woman. Myself, I love the former, but hate the latter, so my review of ""Capital Games"" will reflect that.Steve is a laid-back, mellow type of guy. He left the LAPD and has been working in advertising for the last five years, climbing the ladder to success. Enter one Mark Richfield, new-hire, drop dead gorgeous with a sexy accent to boot and Steve knows his days as top dog in his firm are numbered.Steve and Mark clash from the moment they meet. Mark is a pompous, arrogant know-it-all and Steve butts heads with him 24/7. When their boss takes the office away to a ranch for ""team building"" exercises, I think Steve would rather be shot than go. When a simple exercise goes wrong and the men get stranded in the desert together overnight, things turn heated. All that love-hate emotion finally bursts and they have sex. Both men claim neither is gay, and try to put it behind them, but Steve is falling in love with Mark and with Mark's wedding looming, something has got to give.I've been renting/watching independent films since 1989. Quirky, avant-garde is my thing, so I was excited to see that an M/M author was having a movie made from one of her best-selling books. On one hand, ""Capital Games"" is a great movie, the cast is talented (sometimes with low-budget gay films the acting is sub-par, that is not the case here). On the other, I had some issues with the plot, which is why I did not rate it higher.First, the good things.The production aspects on this film are top-notch. It is beautifully filmed, the sound and editing are perfection. You do not normally see this level of professionalism in low-budget movies, but ""Capital Games"" has that and more. The sights around Los Angeles are gorgeous and the aerial shots sublime. (Yes, I took a few film classes in college.) Two stars for just the cinematography.Second, the acting, as I said, is above-average. Eric Presnall won me over as the sexually confused Steve Miller. He's so cute and his acting so believable I wanted to eat him up with a spoon! I see this guy's career taking off big-time. And while I did enjoy Gregor Cosgrove's performance as Mark, his British accent left a lot to be desired, so if you can get over that, you will probably like his Mark Richfield. Plus, the chemistry the two men shared on screen was burning hot. The nailed the enemies-to-lovers trope perfectly. I added another star for just them. The casting department really hit the jackpot with these two.Now, we have to move to my reservations. While I loved the directing and acting in ""Capital Games,"" the screenplay felt unfinished and disjointed which is why I couldn't rate it higher than 3.5 stars. I read the ""Capital Games"" book many moons ago, so I had a vague idea what the movie would be about. And while it does follow very closely to the novel, the movie does leave out what I felt were some of the most important aspects of the book, namely Mark's relationship with Jack, his roommate, and Steve's dysfunctional dynamic with his bigoted father, a former LAPD cop himself.With only 97 minutes, I know a movie cannot cover everything in a book, Stephen King's novels are a great example of that. But if I were just viewing the movie, never knowing about the book, I would have a hard time following the plot. There were many inconsistencies that were never fully explained and characters who were never developed (Jack). At times I was very confused about what was going on. For example, in a flashback scene, you see an older man pull a gun on Steve and his ex-girlfriend in front of a coffee shop. That is not explained until towards the end, when its revealed the ""older man"" was Steve's dad! Now I know from the book, that action got Steve's father an early retirement, but the whys and hows were never explained in the movie. It just hung out there confusing me.Another example was after Mark and Steve slept together in the desert, Steve becomes this Edward Cullen-like stalker of Mark. It was a tad creepy and made me want to tell Mark to get a restraining order against Steve. Hey, I like Insta-Love plots, but this was one hand-job...not sure how you can go from that to: ""I love you, leave your fiancee."" In one scene, Mark is telling Steve to leave him alone, stop touching him, then in practically the next scene they are making out in their work elevator like the previous conversation never happened! Continuity-wise those scenes did not flow together properly, so viewers who have not read the book I think would go: WTH?Plus, Mark had some huge mood swings in this movie and while the I-want-you-I-don't-want-you can be entertaining, this push and pull was too schizophrenic for me. Mark yelled a lot and then kissed Steve, pushed him away, yelled some more, then kissed him again. I think you get my point. It was a little too soap opera-ish for me.Now, I did say the movie had some hot sex scenes and it did. Mark and Steve should get an MTV Award for Best Kiss in a Movie. I do believe some tongue was involved. The sex scenes are not for the prudish. Yes, we've all seen simulated sex on screen, some bad, some good; but Capital Games took it to a new level by showing Mark and Steve kissing, caressing, then cut away scenes to actual simulated sex. (I had to re-watch it twice to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. For research purposes, of course. *g*)Hey, I did say it had hot sex scenes! So, depending on what you are comfortable with, this movie strays into the NC-17 arena. I admit I gave the movie an extra .5 stars for delving into risque territory. It felt very ""9 1/2 Weeks"" to me.My last niggle was the ending. I don't want to give it away, but it does end exactly like the book. So if you enjoyed that, you will like this. But that ending was the main reason I didn't love the book. Yes, with a love triangle, someone is going to wind up alone and hurt, but I think that could have been avoided by editing the end of the movie to portray Mark as a more caring, compassionate individual by not doing what he did!So, overall, I did like many aspects of ""Capital Games."" I think fans of Ms. Hauser's Action series will love this movie. But for the average gay-themed movie watcher, there are some niggles. Not enough for me to advise against renting/buying it, but still some reservations that makes the movie not join my Top Ten Gay-Themed Films list.Reviews by Jessewave",3,3.5 stars,1388534400,"01 1,

There was no character development which made their actions and motives unbelievable.Secondly, thriller: I have to say I was thrilled when it finished so I didn't have to squirm with discomfort &/or stifle yawns.Thirdly, romance: this was supposedly meant to be a romantic movie about two supposedly straight men falling in love.  There was nothing remotely romantic about it.  The characters were one-dimensional, and the one over-played by Gregor Cosgrove seemed Schizophrenic and about as romantic as three-day-old pizza.  The actors also seemed to be physically uncomfortable in each others' presence, hence absolutely no chemistry.  To be fair, even the best actors would have failed to bring this dismal script and story to a higher level.Finally, comedy: yes, it was so bad as to be almost comical.A lot of reviews make reference to the book, which I have not read and which should be irrelevant - the movie should be able to stand on its own.  Unfortunately, for me, it doesn't.  The script writer, author and executive producer is G A Hauser, who I assume is a woman.  Why is it that so many women think they can write convincingly about gay men ?

However, when he observed anything that appeared inauthentic on some level, he'd scream repeatedly, ""Mass confusion, just mass confusion, honey!"" Looking back, he was more than accurate in every account of his keen observations.Capital Games is a film filled with ""mass confusion"" early on. The story line is clear but the character's motives and initiatives are chaotic and often unsettling. Yet, the extremely attractive, correction:sexy, beautiful, and masculine, male leads are alluring enough to hold your attention to see what eventually happens in this cornucopia of denial, disruption, misleading appearances, and ""deception""?  Buckle up cause it gets even more chaotic and inauthentic.I did not like the ""lost scene"" and the scene mechanics when the two leads finally ""connect."" Something simply did not work, whether it was the suddeness in direction or the director's attempt to creative a visual for a more realistice ""first time"" for both characters. The acting slips and the dynamics add to the inauthenticity I cited earlier.CG is not a perfect film, but let me get to my point before I lose it. THIS IS THE BEST FILM I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.The film is sexy and diverse and pushes all the button, homophobia, racism, bigotry, and family rejection, yet, still though full of contradictions. By the way, why to beautiful men who think they are straight go after the most unattractive women?)As a film with a happy ending it is less predicatble than it is a take-off of scenarios we've all seen before. At least in Sex in the City, Bigg never enetered the church, and I still hold that writer/director ploy sacred.After learning it is a film based on an AG Hauser novel and characters, I still have mixed emotions and strong feelings about women writing about the men who sleep with men experience. On the other hand, I will seek out her work in the future to see if she can remain effective in her authenticity of the angst, stress, and love true to male/male relations. That is a plus for her.Don't miss out, BUY THE DAMNED DVD. If you don't, you'll be sorry and will missed a low, budget independent gem. View with few expectations and come way pleased as I was.
