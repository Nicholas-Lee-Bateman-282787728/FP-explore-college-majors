1019671,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000ICL3NI,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[0, 0]","""Amazing how grimly we hang onto our misery...Finally, there's nothing for death to take away.""--Charles BukowskiCharles Bukowski's 'Tatotum' is the ultimate argument for the high-life--or the low life--depending on your point of view.  And, really, this is what Bukowski's more-than-semi autobiographical alter ego, Hank Chinaski, struggles with in life.  Relying on wine, women, and horseraces, Chinaski is a serial worker, scraping along on just enough money as an aspiring writer to fuel his favorite vices.  Played with prowess by an able Matt Dillon, the slow-moving narrative and impersonation is just perfect for a martyr who is willing to suffer for this vision of life.  Like the rest of us, he dreams of living in high society with all the perks he can attain.  But also like many of the rest of us, reality makes itself known.  For him it comes in the menial labor he takes, so he can partake in what Kurt Vonnegut called, ""The Breakfast of Champions"".  His vision is mainly brought out in Jan (Lil Taylor) who becomes the closest woman to becoming a real love interest.  She loves him best as a ruggedly pedestrian lover, so when he gets out--I mean into--the gutter by winning at horse racing, she will have none of his fancy new threads or rich new airs.  He is constantly torn, not only from his frustrated writing success, but his desire to live like a wealthy man in a poor man's shoes.Philosophical, funny, and often heartbreaking, Bukowski's vision is brought to life enough to give us all the courage to fail at what we love best.  While I personally envision a better ideal for myself, Bukowski gives us the courage to at least know what we want and stick to it.  With this movie, we can at least live Bukowski's life vicariously and at a safer distance.",4,'Breakfast of Champions',1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,1776,"['Amazing', 'how', 'grimly', 'hang', 'misery', 'Finally', 'nothing', 'death', 'take', 'away', 'Charles', 'BukowskiCharles', 'Bukowski', ""'Tatotum"", 'ultimate', 'argument', 'high-life', 'low', 'life', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'really', 'what', 'Bukowski', 'more-than-semi', 'autobiographical', 'alter', 'ego', 'Hank', 'Chinaski', 'life', 'Relying', 'wine', 'women', 'horseraces', 'Chinaski', 'serial', 'worker', 'scraping', 'along', 'just', 'enough', 'money', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'fuel', 'favorite', 'vices', 'Played', 'prowess', 'able', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'slow-moving', 'narrative', 'impersonation', 'just', 'perfect', 'martyr', 'who', 'willing', 'suffer', 'vision', 'life', 'rest', 'living', 'high', 'society', 'perks', 'can', 'attain', 'also', 'many', 'rest', 'reality', 'known', 'menial', 'labor', 'can', 'partake', 'what', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'called', 'Breakfast', 'Champions', 'vision', 'mainly', 'brought', 'out', 'Jan', 'Lil', 'Taylor', 'who', 'closest', 'woman', 'becoming', 'real', 'love', 'interest', 'best', 'ruggedly', 'pedestrian', 'lover', 'so', 'when', 'out', 'mean', 'gutter', 'winning', 'horse', 'racing', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'fancy', 'new', 'threads', 'rich', 'new', 'airs', 'constantly', 'torn', 'not', 'only', 'frustrated', 'writing', 'success', 'desire', 'live', 'wealthy', 'man', 'poor', 'man', 'shoes.Philosophical', 'funny', 'often', 'heartbreaking', 'Bukowski', 'vision', 'brought', 'life', 'enough', 'give', 'courage', 'fail', 'what', 'love', 'best', 'personally', 'envision', 'better', 'ideal', 'Bukowski', 'courage', 'least', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'stick', 'movie', 'can', 'least', 'live', 'Bukowski', 'life', 'vicariously', 'safer', 'distance']",Factotum

1019675,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000ICL3NI,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 1]","After Matt Dillon's phenomenal performance in CRASH, most will probably rush to pick up a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is for real or simply got a lucky rebound from a great script.Well, Factotum certainly has its moments, but the plainness of ...everything will most likely turn viewers off. However nothing should be taken away from Dillon. His performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor, proving he's a solid actor with significant chops; it's just a shame about the directing and script.The story is about Henry ""Hank"" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy. He quits or gets fired from jobs in mere minutes, only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even drearier women while trying to write a nonconformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about except that it involves ""everything"" (cancer, movies, you, me).Skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a loser girlfriend who's just as dispiriting as himself, Hank tries vainly to discover what his life is supposed to hold for him. Whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation. Some may say that he never does, while others might argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity.Regardless, there's not much substance to Factotum even with Matt Dillon's fine performance. The story meanders through Hank's life without much thought given as to where to take the audience. And that's a shame. Dillon's performance would've shone even brighter if given a decent script.",2,Funny But Sadly Lacking,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1577,"['Matt', 'Dillon', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'CRASH', 'most', 'will', 'probably', 'rush', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'FACTOTUM', 'see', 'Dillon', 'real', 'simply', 'got', 'lucky', 'rebound', 'great', 'script.Well', 'Factotum', 'certainly', 'moments', 'plainness', 'everything', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'turn', 'viewers', 'off', 'However', 'nothing', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'Dillon', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'full', 'excellent', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'proving', 'solid', 'actor', 'significant', 'chops', 'just', 'shame', 'directing', 'script.The', 'story', 'Henry', 'Hank', 'Chinaski', 'Dillon', 'refusal', 'conform', 'anything', 'resembling', 'normalcy', 'fired', 'jobs', 'mere', 'minutes', 'only', 'find', 'back', 'dreary', 'pub', 'meeting', 'even', 'drearier', 'women', 'trying', 'write', 'nonconformist', 'novel', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'novel', 'everything', 'cancer', 'movies', '.Skipping', 'workplace', 'workplace', 'constantly', 'returning', 'Jan', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'loser', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'dispiriting', 'Hank', 'vainly', 'discover', 'what', 'life', 'supposed', 'hold', 'ever', 'what', 'up', 'interpretation', 'may', 'say', 'never', 'others', 'might', 'argue', 'life', 'simply', 'path', 'obscurity.Regardless', 'not', 'much', 'substance', 'Factotum', 'even', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'fine', 'performance', 'story', 'meanders', 'Hank', 'life', 'much', 'thought', 'given', 'where', 'take', 'audience', 'shame', 'Dillon', 'performance', 'would', ""'ve"", 'shone', 'even', 'brighter', 'given', 'decent', 'script']",Factotum

I found many of the scenes funny, especially the numerous firings from dead-end jobs by angry bosses who catch Chernasky drinking on the job.

Unless of course you want to root for the main character, an irascible verbal and physical abuser (or his victims) with a penchant toward contemptible disrespect who appears to drift aimlessly and irresponsibly through life on the pretext of being a writer. This main character (Hank Chinaski as played by Matt Dillon) is showcased as being just plain disgusting and unlikeable with an incessant moronic, monotoned and demented demeanor as he and his opposite-sex cohorts, each one inflamed with the pathetic disease and blight of co-dependency, bumble their way along. However, if the foregoing doesn't phase you and you rather enjoy watching losers wallow around towards no particular end (or, alternatively) if you savor the prospect of watching the lead character as played by Matt Dillon mumbling monotone for hours, guzzling liquor, puking, bullying, scratching his infected privates, verbally abusing his parents and physically abusing his girlfriend and other random citizens of the general public, then this movie may be for you. I salvaged out a couple of interesting scenes that collectively lasted several seconds having comedic and synoptic intent. This movie fails on another level in that it doesn't show one iota the writer struggle inherent in the implied victory or a redemptive counterbalance clearly enough to forge a credible hook in the minds of the viewers. Furthermore, the theme itself, from the public eye will be seen as the life struggle of an unknown writer with rather blotchy literary credentials at best. As such, it is inherently unsuitable and incapable of tapping the mainsprings of viewing audiences today, who, for the most part, seldom even crack a book themselves, much less identify with the writer-struggle, particularly those struggles which are the fruits, not of a renown literary talent but of one whose talent might arguably be described as innovative but (with all due respect to commendable efforts) relatively diminutive - something of a convenient overly glorified shooting star or feather for feather's sake in the hot L.A. hat. Limited parallels (heavy drinking, lewd behavior and womanizing) can be drawn between Bukowski and poet Dylan Thomas but the buck screeches to a stop there, as where Bubowski's achievements are arguably constrained from the standpoint of universal consensus, Thomas's veer on toward infinity and takes his rightful place as one of the greatest poets of our century. And per the aforementioned there is ultimately no redemptive solution save the eject button and another sad sigh. And these reasons are why this movie will bore most people out of their ever-loving skull and fly at warp speed to the $3.99 pile.

1019679,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000ICL3NI,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 4]","Factotum is yet another failed attempt to capture the spirit and essence of poet, novelist, gambler, and drunk, Charles Bukowski. But if you can succeed in conveying even a fraction of his genius, you still have a pretty entertaining film.First, I will dispense with the three films I know of that attempted to capture the essence of Charles Bukowski:1.  Tales of Ordinary MadnessMarco Ferreri directed this film in 1981, and it stars Ben Gazzara as the ""Bukowski"" character, and therein lays the problem. Gazzara is just too handsome and never lets himself go--never gives in to the wild abandon the part requires. It is a nice try, though.2.  Crazy Love, made in 1987, is a Belgian film based partially on The Copulating Mermaid of Venice, California and Ham on Rye, both stories by Charles Bukowski. Crazy Love also marks the directorial debut of Dominique Deruddere (Everybody's Famous and Wait Until Spring, Bandini). While Crazy Love has been consistently affirmed by critics and viewers alike the film has proven much too controversial for mainstream acceptance and has remained virtually unknown even with Francis Ford Coppola, Sean Penn, and Madonna fighting for its cause. Not to be confused with another film called Crazy Love, that one is about an obsessive love where a guy goes to prison for hiring thugs to throw lye in a girl's face, then goes to prison for twenty years, and when he gets out, is still obsessed with her, and eventually wins her love. Believe it or not, this is based on a true story. The other Crazy Love, the Bukowskiesque one, has a picture of a guy with a bandaged face, but it is Bukowski, or the character based on him, who suffered from extreme acne. I have never seen this one, so can't attest to whatever it was that Francis Ford Coppola saw in it.3.  Also from 1987, Barfly was directed by Barbet Schroeder, and Bukowski himself worked on the script. He also has a small cameo as--you guessed it--a barfly. Mickey Rourke really let himself go, or maybe, given the depths to which he's sunk, maybe he had to clean up and get in shape to play the role, but anyway, Rourke is almost ugly enough, and certainly can't be accused of holding back. His character is Henry Chinaski, which is the name Bukowski often uses for thinly disguised autobiographical characters. Faye Dunaway plays Wanda Wilcox, another barfly that Chinaski picks up. Though a bit older than she was in her Bonnie and Clyde hey day, she is still beautiful. She is credible as a barfly, though. When Rourke spots her he asks the bartender why such a beautiful woman is in such a dive bar. ""Wanda?"" the barkeep replies. ""Oh, she's crazy."" He makes a bee line for her. This film starts off pretty good, but then there is a jolting shift of tone when a rich and beautiful literary agent takes an interest in Rourke's barfly. Perhaps this was what Bukowski's real life was like, once he had achieved fame and notoriety, but reality is one thing, making a believable film is another. We never see anything to suggest that he has any talent or ambition to write, and suddenly, he's an eccentric literary genius who rich women can't resist?When I studied Creative Writing at San Francisco State University one of my professors knew Bukowski before he made it big. He said that he didn't really drink as much as the characters in his books. He had a thermos mug that kept his brewski chilled, and he would have one beer and nurse it all night. He cultivated the two-fisted drinker legend purely to create an image. I suppose there might be some truth to that, but on the other hand, he must have done his share of hard drinking--or ""research"" as writers like to call it.This brings us to the issue at hand, the 2005 film, Factotum. A Factotum is a handyman or servant, employed to do all kinds of work around the house. It was also the title to one of Charles Bukowski's books, which, along with Post Office, and his writing in general, was the basis of the film. Directed by Bent Hamer (great name for a factotum, actually), a Norwegian director known for a few films that focused on the lives of old people, mining great insight from close observation of the seemingly mundane, it also features keen observations. There is one scene where Henry Chinaski (Matt Dillon) picks up Laura (Marisa Tomei) in a bar. He buys her and himself a drink with his last dollar, and when they drink, they ""mirror"" each other exactly, so you know they are going to end up together. When they go back to Laura's place, they stop at a liquor store, and she says to charge it to her sugar daddy. This is exactly like the scene in Barfly when Henry goes to Wanda's place.Matt Dillon falls somewhere between Ben Gazzara and Mickey Rourke. He is also too handsome. He tries to ""Rourke"" it up, but can't really mask his essential good looks. Still, he does his best work since Drug Store Cowboy, or his Oscar winning supporting actor role in Crash. But he doesn't top it, and some parts just don't gel. Like, he is working at one menial job and has to drive a truck. He gasses it up and just drives away without even taking the nozzle out of the tank. I didn't believe that he was that dumb or careless. He is supposed to be a writer, but didn't seem smart enough. Also, Bukowski was really ugly, but he found he could still get women. If you were ugly enough, it would work in your favor. Matt Dillon can pick up women, but if he looked as ugly as Charles Bukowski did, I doubt he would get anywhere.  So, the role didn't really work for him.Lili Taylor played Jan, another of his alcoholic girlfriends. She was very credible in her part, the kind of woman who will push a guy to get into fights. When the pair goes to the horse races, a jerk refuses to give up his seat, reserved earlier by Henry's newspaper (wouldn't you know it? the guy is a real estate agent). Jan is upset that he let's him get away with it, so she flirts with the guy until Henry is provoked into an altercation. That did have the ring of truth to it. She is THAT kind of woman. When Chinaski actually cleans up the apartment, she comes home and is upset, thinking he must have some other woman on the side. Lili Taylor really got inside Jan's skin. When Henry starts to make money betting on the horses, she turns against him. That is so typical, like a bucket of crabs, and when one crab starts to climb out of the bucket, the other crabs pull it back down.Why is it that European directors always think they and only they can appreciate a writer like Bukowski? Bukowski was the poet laureate of Los Angeles, and why can't an American director do him justice? Just wondering. Is it another case of a prophet without honor in his hometown, or is it that European's in their arrogance think they are the only ones who truly appreciate his genius? Is Charles Bukowski yet another example of the Jerry Lewis syndrome?One final rant: Maria Tomei. Why is she always cast as the one who loves the unlovable? Maybe not always, but lately, and if she doesn't watch out she will find herself getting typecast. She played Maggie Lauten in 21 episodes of the Cosby Show spin-off, ""A Different World,"" from 1987 through 1988. In 1992 she played Mona Lisa Vito opposite Joe Pesci, who was ""My Cousin Vinny."" For that she won a best supporting actress Oscar? In 1994 she was in Only You, with Robert Downey Jr. What was that about? Destiny. Faith Corvatch (Marisa Tomei) believes that two soul-mates can be united if they find each other. From the Ouija board, she has found the name of her missing half, and it is D-A-M-O-N B-R-A-D-L-E-Y. Later, at the carnival, the fortune teller sees the name Damon Bradley in the Crystal Ball and Faith is convinced. 14 years later, she is engaged to a dull podiatrist and plans to marry until she gets a call from one of his classmates who is on his way to Venice, Italy. The classmate is Damon Bradley (Robert Downey Jr.).After that was when she started getting typecast. She played herself on ""Seinfeld,"" and was supposed to fall for George Costanza (Jason Alexander). The original air date was February 8th, 1996, for the 14th episode of the 7th season, entitled ""The Cadillac."" An hour-long episode, Jerry performs in Atlantic City, and he's flush with cash. He gets a huge wad for the Atlantic City gig, and decides to buy his dad a Cadillac. However, this has the unintended consequence of getting him accused of embezzling money from the condo board, where he serves as president. They don't buy his story that his son bought it for him, because no one thinks Jerry is funny enough to succeed as a comedian. Morty is put on trial, and kicked out of the condo. Allusions to Nixon's resignation abound. Meanwhile, thanks to Elaine, George can score a date with ""My Cousin Vinnie"" star Marisa Tomei but Elaine objects because of George's engagement with Susan. Kramer turns the tables on the cable company when they want to disconnect his service. They make appointments, but he is always gone. Just like the cable guy always shows up when you've been waiting all day, and just step out for a second.Susan Biddle Ross: Hey! What're you watching?[looks at TV]Susan Biddle Ross: Only You?

Downhill from there and in a way she came full circle, because her character was once again named Maggie. For The Wild Hogs, box office hit but critical disaster, of 2007, she had the thankless task of pretending to be attracted to Dudley Frank (William H. Macy). It went something like this (poor girl):Maggie (Marisa Tomei): That's too bad. I wanted you to try my chili. It's pretty hot.Dudley Frank (William H. Macy): No, I'll try it. I like your kind of hot.

1019680,AL9HZLZT4X1KL,B000ICL3NI,CV Rick,"[34, 35]","Matt Dillon is Henry Chinaski, the alter-ego of Charles Bukowski.  This is a movie about a man who finds solace in a bottle and outlet in the written word.  He struggles to be a writer, knowing that his perceptions on society are unique and valuable, but at the same time believing everything to be pointless.He can't hold a job down because he's a drunk, but he believes he can't hold a job down because every job is shackling his spirit.  He can't keep a relationship because he's not able to feel anything beyond his own mind, and that's such a fountain of strong emotion that he has to dampen it with booze.This is not a happy movie.  This is a movie about despair and the agony of addiction.  There's no message of recovery or vindication or even escape as in Leaving Las Vegas - the simple message is that for some people life is just too much to handle.  For that message it's a true story, unadulterated by the can-do propaganda of self-help America.  This is the dark side of civilization, the story of one of those left behind.Matt Dillon becomes Chinaski and he delivers a powerful performance, at times violent, angry, and hopeless, while at other times driven and manic.  He sums up his life with the line, ""All I want to do is get my check and get drunk.  It might not be noble, but it's my choice.""The movie ends with these thoughts, and it's from that world that Bukowski rose to give us a look at ourselves.""If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs. And maybe your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery, isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance. Of how much you really want to do it. And you'll do it, despite rejection in the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods. And the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is. ""It's not a movie for everyone, but I watched it three times.

1019682,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B000ICL3NI,Douglas King,"[0, 0]","Charles Bukowski is one of my favorite writers. After seeing ""Barfly"" and now ""Factotum"", I've come to the conclusion that perhaps his work just doesn't translate well to film. Charles Bukowski rarely wrote about anything other than his own life, partly because he was self-absorbed, but also because he probably knew that he was such a fascinating character. Underneath all his crude, self-destructive behavior was clearly a sensitive man who found the phoniness of modern society completely unbearable. As a result, he preferred the company of people on the fringes of society because, for all their flaws, they were at least real and honest.Like ""Barfly"", ""Factotum"" is not a poor film by any means. But I don't think it really captures all of the comedy and tragedy of Bukowski's novel. What makes it worth watching are the performances ... I prefer Matt Dillon's subtle performance in ""Factotum"" to the more mannered performance Mickey Rourke gave in ""Barfly"". Lili Taylor is also wonderful as Henry's (aka Charles) volatile, hard-living girlfriend. Marisa Tomei makes a brief appearance playing what I believe to be the same character Faye Dunaway did in ""Barfly"". Tomei plays the character as more dazed than hostile.Glancing at some of the other reviews, characters portrayed in this film seem to evoke a lot of harsh judgment from people, not unlike the same judgment Henry gets from his own father in one of the film's best scenes. If you are able to maintain a curiosity and sympathy for people who live on the fringes of society, than this film is worth a look. And you should DEFINITELY check out Bukowski's novels and stories.",3,Somewhat lost in translation,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,1640,"['Charles', 'Bukowski', 'one', 'favorite', 'writers', 'seeing', 'Barfly', 'now', 'Factotum', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'perhaps', 'work', 'just', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'film', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', 'rarely', 'wrote', 'anything', 'other', 'own', 'life', 'partly', 'was', 'self-absorbed', 'also', 'probably', 'knew', 'was', 'such', 'fascinating', 'character', 'crude', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'was', 'clearly', 'sensitive', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'phoniness', 'modern', 'society', 'completely', 'unbearable', 'result', 'preferred', 'company', 'people', 'fringes', 'society', 'flaws', 'were', 'least', 'real', 'honest.Like', 'Barfly', 'Factotum', 'not', 'poor', 'film', 'means', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'Bukowski', 'novel', 'What', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'performances', 'prefer', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'subtle', 'performance', 'Factotum', 'more', 'mannered', 'performance', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'gave', 'Barfly', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Henry', 'aka', 'Charles', 'volatile', 'hard-living', 'girlfriend', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'brief', 'appearance', 'playing', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'same', 'character', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'did', 'Barfly', 'Tomei', 'character', 'more', 'dazed', 'hostile.Glancing', 'other', 'reviews', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'film', 'seem', 'evoke', 'lot', 'harsh', 'judgment', 'people', 'not', 'same', 'judgment', 'Henry', 'own', 'father', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'able', 'maintain', 'curiosity', 'sympathy', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'fringes', 'society', 'film', 'look', 'should', 'DEFINITELY', 'check', 'out', 'Bukowski', 'novels', 'stories']",Factotum
1019683,A2ZT3DIS3GGE25,B000ICL3NI,Duncan C. White,"[1, 4]","This film is pretty insulting to Bukowski, and anyone living in real poverty. You have the milk skinned Dillon looking like a fattened cow on the screen, while pretending to play a poverty stricken and literally starving poet Bukowski. Then you have the spotless bars and model quality actresses playing skid row denziens. Its really fairly insulting and to anyone familiar with Bukowski's work its a dealbreaker. Filmmaking is about creating believable worlds, this world is totally unbelievable to even the casual Bukowski reader.Whatever anyone says about Barfly at least Rourke seemed to make an effort to 'get low' so to speak to play the part.In Factotum Dillon has this horrible pseudo-intellectual air around him in this part, and this far off look in an attempt to look wise.

Because his writing is a wonderful embodiment of some of Zen's core principles:1.  seeing/accepting/living life exactly as it is, being exactly who/what you are from moment to moment---no fillers or additives, no wishful thinking or cheap sentimentalism, no attempt to control or manipulate events2.  radical agnosticism, sometimes called ""keeping the not-knowing mind"" in one's day-to-day, moment-to-moment existence; not clinging to concepts or projections3.  direct experience---related to #1, entails not being bound by any social conditioning, self-delusion, or reliance-on/conformity-to authority or conventionality, having a raw unfiltered exposure to all of life's vicissitudesThis film captures all 3 of those principles beautifully: we see Chinaski (the habitual alter ego in all of Bukowski's prose work) passing through a series of dead end jobs, hooking up with a number of similarly down and out women, moving around from roach motel to roach motel, apparently unconcerned with the past or the future.Yes, Matt Dillon is way too handsome to play Chinaski, and both Marisa Tomei and Lili Taylor might also have been too attractive to play their characters.  Yes, it's not true LA-street-level-grunge that the film is shot in, and the film sets are generally too sleek and clean to be true to life.But so what?  The acting is generally top-notch, the film editing is brisk and keeps the vignettes flowing along nicely, and the soundtrack is simply gorgeous.  This is a far superior work than Barbet Shroeder's ""Barfly"" in large part because of the above, and also because Dillon is light years better an actor than Mickey Rourke could ever dream of being.Moreover, ""Factotum"" is an excellent introduction to Bukowski's work and style.  Of course there is no comparison to his actual books---I highly recommend his novels ""Ham on Rye,"" ""Women,"" and ""Post Office"" as well as his collection of short stories, ""The Most Beautiful Woman In Town"" and some of his poetry books like ""The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over The Hills"" and ""Burning In Water Drowning In Flame.""

If director Bent Hamer and screenwriters Jim Stark and Hamer were striving to create the milieu in which the story of Bukowski's alcohol-soaked, lowlife women lover life as a wannabe poet and writer, a life of depression and failure and striving to be something other than a misfit, then they have succeeded admirably.  If that is the goal then the movie deserves five stars. Sadly, the monochromatic delivery of lines, of lack of movement, of repetitive failures, and of the inordinately boring voice over delivered in a monotone makes staying with this film almost impossible.Matt Dillon is Henry Chinaski (read Charles Bukowski), a man who writes when he is barely sober from his 24 hour a day drinking, submitting stories to magazines and editors.  But his main concern is making just enough money for the next bottle of booze.  He hooks up with some equally sad women - alcoholic Jan (Lili Taylor in her usual fine characterization ability) and alcoholic Laura (the always fine Marisa Tomei) - and some transient buddies whom he meets at his various nothing jobs, attracting the attention at times of  guys who will join him in a bookie racket, but always struggling with employers who do not tolerate his bellicose and drunken behavior.  Even his parents throw him out. He is a sad sack of a man who finally gets a story accepted by Black Sparrow Press, seemingly the purpose of dragging us through this depressing 94 minutes of a film.Matt Dillon's performance has been praised by some and he does seem to embody Henry Chinaski's dreary soul, but the performance (especially the boring voice over portion) is so flatline that it is difficult to care for him at all.  Yes, Bukowski wrote and lived like this and for Bukowski fans the movie will satisfy.  For others this film is just too interminably dreary and long to tolerate for a second viewing.

1019692,A202FGBQHO5638,B000ICL3NI,L. Alper,"[2, 3]","Having read positive reviews of the latest Charles Bukowski adaptation, Factotum, I was looking forward to seeing it. Having viewed the DVD, I am now left puzzled as to Bent Hamer's (director & co-writer) choices in bringing this early Bukowski roman a' clef to screen.On the plus side is Matt Dillon's performance as Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinanski. Dillon has clearly seen the documentary Bukowski: Born Into This; his re-creation of the man is eery in it's accuracy. All of Bukowski's mannerisms, speech patterns & physicality are channeled thru Dillon in what almost amounts to possession. The last time an actor has achieved such an amazing portrayal was Robert Downey Jr's Chaplin. Unfortunately, this is really the only thing Factotum has to make it worthwhile.The original story of Factotum was clearly set in the low rent areas of Los Angeles of the early 1960's. The characters and their lifestyle simply don't translate well to the millennial culture of addiction treatment. Yet Hamer has chosen to physically place his movie in the Los Angeles of today by using current vehicles, current clothing styles, and establishing shots of downtown Los Angeles that show modern buildings. Yet puzzlingly, he has his actors living in a world without computers, where smoking is common inside office buildings, and the race track betting windows have no glass (bullet proof or otherwise) between the gamblers & the clerks.A number of other directorial choices left me wondering why no one gave Hamer (a Norwegian making his first U.S. film) some advice. A scene featuring Lili Taylor in her underwear clearly shows her 21st century Pilates toned body, complete with 6 pack abs. Yet she is portraying an alcoholic, a woman who will go with any man she meets in a bar as long as he has a bottle. No attempt has been made to make Ms. Taylor look like she is a woman who is worn out by a life on the streets chasing her next drink. Later in the film, following a scene where Chinanski returns to his childhood home in search of a place to stay only to be kicked out, we see Chinanski now living in a small but nicely furnished apartment, complete with working phone. No explanation is given as to how he went from being a homeless vagabond to being able to afford to move into an apartment of his own. He's still out of work & drinking at this time. It is lapses in reality such as these as well as seeing bosses smoking during interviews while wearing current clothing that wrenched me out of the world of Factotum & kept me from enjoying what little story there was.The story arc is almost non-existent. Nothing really happens. Chinanski gets hired for some menial work, Chinanski drinks, Chinanski gets fired, Chinanski drinks some more & sleeps with either Lili Taylor or Marisa Tomei. In between he writes longhand (Bukowski always toted around his typewriter) & pontificates in a voice-over. That's about the entire film.The extras on the DVD are few; there is a Norwegian language `Making Of' that really wasn't (it primarily talked about Hamer's previous film Kitchen Stories which seems to be a Norwegian cinema touchstone), and a theatrical trailer.So to sum up: this really isn't a DVD worth buying. If you are interested in seeing how good Matt Dillon's performance is, rent this.

The movie is a beautiful piece of film making hitting all the right notes despite the grim plotline.  However, if you are expecting a piece of work by Charles Bukowski - you will be severely disappointed.I rated this movie on its own merit and not the fact that it was suppose to be a piece of work by Charles Bukowski - then, I would have rated it 1 star.  The other reviewers have it right, the feel and mood of the movie is much too light and the actors themselves are too pretty.  But if you are not familiar with Bukowski's work (or ignore it for the sake of this film), then you will appreciate this little gem of a story about a man who has such flashes of brillance as a writer, that not even heavy drinking can dim it.  The women in his life are fellow drunks but not even this shared passion can sustain a relationship.  It hurt to watch the decisions he makes as we watch his slow decline.  By the end of the movie he can't even hold a job for a whole day and then not even make it through the application process.  It's tragic that he always wanted to be a writer and never gave up even at his lowest point but his addiction didn't allow him to know he had finally achieved his goal of being a published author.The acting of both Dillion and Taylor is fantastic.  They have the lumbering of binge drinking aftermaths down cold.  I loved the whole piece from start to finish.

1019696,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000ICL3NI,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[5, 5]","Factotumis a very good movie.  To my mind, this movie has been misunderstood and somewhat underrated.  Much of the criticism of this movie is valid based upon the letter of Bukowski's work.  But when you really think about the spirit of his work, this movie succeeds in translating that to a present-day story that more people can relate to.  This film best serves those less familiar with his writing.  Hopefully Bukuowski fans can give this movie a second chance and grow to appreciate it from that vantage point.There can be no more fitting tribute to the anti-hero persona of Bukowski than Chinaski, his alter-ego smoothly under-played by Matt Dillon.  Once again, Dillon hardly matches the profile of the gruff and unattractive Chinaski from the original writings.  But he rises to the occasion and embodies the character in ways that looks alone cannot describe.The down-in-the gutter depravity that Bukowski constantly seeks to illuminate with his work is the center piece of this movie.  The realism of this movie is so tragic it's comical.  Wandering from lost job to failed relationship, Chinaski is often in a drunken stupor of disillusionment and self-loathing.  When he does find a woman worth keeping, he can only continuously lose her.  This is real life in a world where a man simply doesn't think it's worth it to care.While Mr. Chinaski is offered many opportunities to work below his station as a statue cleaner, factory worker or janitor, he is rarely given the chance to do work that lets him use his passion to write. Sadly, even when one of his stories is chosen, his mail is taken, read, and discarded before he even learns of it.  So even his little victories are swept away from him.In making this movie, they made creative decisions that deviated from the original story.  The story takes place in the present day and not in the period in which Bukowski lived and worked.  Yet they did that to adapt the spirit of Bukowski to a movie for today's audience.  The mixed reaction to this movie is akin to the reaction his work and life.  So it comes as no surprise to me.What does surprise me is to hear many fans of Bukowski's work state that this movie does not measure up to the message of his writing.  In my mind, the spirit of his work should not be overpowered by the literal recounting of it.If you have a dark sense of humor and a love of poetry, this story is painfully funny and all-together real.  One can't help but be reminded of that famous Alan Ginsberg poem that starts, ""I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical.""Granted, this movie's negative message is somewhat of a downer if taken literally.  So it is not for everyone.  Yet if you can suspend judgment, this is a very interesting movie.  The material is succinct yet well done, and the acting is minimalist yet once again well done.  The one point I would make in criticism is that the first half of this movie isn't nearly as good as the second half.  If you watch the second half alone a few times, it's easier to appreciate what they were shooting for in the beginning.Regardless, I really enjoyed this movie.  I've watched it many times and it still rings true to me, despite the artistic liberties they took.  This is not for the typical movie night.  But if you want to watch something dark, subtle and creative, this is it.Enjoy.",4,Factotum - True To The Spirit of Bukowski If Not The Letter - Deserves A Second Look,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,3371,"['Factotumis', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'mind', 'movie', 'been', 'misunderstood', 'somewhat', 'underrated', 'Much', 'criticism', 'movie', 'valid', 'based', 'letter', 'Bukowski', 'work', 'when', 'really', 'think', 'spirit', 'work', 'movie', 'translating', 'present-day', 'story', 'more', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'film', 'best', 'serves', 'less', 'familiar', 'writing', 'Hopefully', 'Bukuowski', 'fans', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'second', 'chance', 'grow', 'appreciate', 'vantage', 'point.There', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'anti-hero', 'persona', 'Bukowski', 'Chinaski', 'alter-ego', 'smoothly', 'under-played', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Once', 'again', 'Dillon', 'hardly', 'profile', 'gruff', 'unattractive', 'Chinaski', 'original', 'writings', 'occasion', 'character', 'ways', 'alone', 'can', 'not', 'describe.The', 'down-in-the', 'gutter', 'depravity', 'Bukowski', 'constantly', 'illuminate', 'work', 'center', 'piece', 'movie', 'realism', 'movie', 'so', 'tragic', 'comical', 'Wandering', 'lost', 'job', 'failed', 'relationship', 'Chinaski', 'often', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'disillusionment', 'self-loathing', 'When', 'find', 'woman', 'keeping', 'can', 'only', 'continuously', 'lose', 'real', 'life', 'world', 'where', 'man', 'simply', ""n't"", 'think', 'worth', 'care.While', 'Mr.', 'Chinaski', 'offered', 'many', 'opportunities', 'work', 'station', 'statue', 'cleaner', 'factory', 'worker', 'janitor', 'rarely', 'given', 'chance', 'do', 'work', 'use', 'passion', 'write', 'Sadly', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'stories', 'chosen', 'mail', 'taken', 'read', 'discarded', 'even', 'So', 'even', 'little', 'victories', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'him.In', 'making', 'movie', 'made', 'creative', 'decisions', 'deviated', 'original', 'story', 'story', 'place', 'present', 'day', 'not', 'period', 'Bukowski', 'lived', 'worked', 'did', 'adapt', 'spirit', 'Bukowski', 'movie', 'today', 'audience', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'movie', 'akin', 'reaction', 'work', 'life', 'surprise', 'me.What', 'surprise', 'hear', 'many', 'fans', 'Bukowski', 'work', 'state', 'movie', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'message', 'writing', 'mind', 'spirit', 'work', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'overpowered', 'literal', 'recounting', 'it.If', 'have', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'love', 'poetry', 'story', 'painfully', 'funny', 'all-together', 'real', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'reminded', 'famous', 'Alan', 'Ginsberg', 'poem', 'saw', 'best', 'minds', 'generation', 'destroyed', 'madness', 'starving', 'hysterical', 'Granted', 'movie', 'negative', 'message', 'somewhat', 'downer', 'taken', 'literally', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'suspend', 'judgment', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'material', 'succinct', 'yet', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'minimalist', 'yet', 'once', 'again', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'point', 'would', 'make', 'criticism', 'first', 'half', 'movie', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'half', 'watch', 'second', 'half', 'alone', 'few', 'times', 'easier', 'appreciate', 'what', 'were', 'shooting', 'beginning.Regardless', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'true', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'took', 'not', 'typical', 'movie', 'night', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'dark', 'subtle', 'creative', 'it.Enjoy']",Factotum

In other words this is no falling over in the street drunk, Chinaski at this point in his life at least is a maintenance drinker: he imbibes as much as he can and at all times in the day...but he maintains and makes an attempt at working, carrying on with women though his real love is writing which he manages to do daily.Several things about ""Factotum"" are just not right. First of all, though Bukowski lived most of his life in Los Angeles, director Hamer has unwisely decided to base this story in nowheres-ville, USA. Bukowski, as well as John Fante for example is all about L.A. ""Factotum"" presents an ersatz Los Angeles which is disconcerting at best and fake at worst. This movie was filmed in Minneapolis but in several shots the skyline is of downtown L.A. (the Occidental Tower, the Eastern Columbia Building) and other times...it isn't.Secondly, the film is just not skuzzy enough to reflect the world that Bukowski writes about and though Dillon tries hard to attain a sort of ironic, intelligent, detached, debauched manner...he just cannot pull it off and this skews the film slightly off center, off plumb.Lili Taylor and Marisa Tomei on the other hand do pull it off: both play major drunks who are woefully promiscuous but they both display a softness, a tragic vulnerability and a realistic and intelligent view of life that makes their performances transcendent. Dillon is good at times but dull: too often his performance is just that...a performance: he's faking it (which of course all acting is) but here  it shows and therein lays the problem.Norwegian director Bent Hamer has a good eye and a good sense of what this material is about but his mise en scene is detached and objective when what this movie calls for is sleazy, sloppy, over-the-top melodrama even: this slice of Bukowski life should have been cut with a blunt axe not a surgery sharp scalpel.",3,Clean-Cut,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2189,"['Matt', 'Dillon', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'problematic', 'Crash', 'here', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', 'creation', 'Henry', 'Chinaski', 'full', 'time', 'writer', 'are', 'going', 'try', 'go', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'start', 'full', 'time', 'alcoholic', 'as', 'much', 'control', 'life', 'professional', 'drunk', 'can', 'be', 'other', 'words', 'falling', 'over', 'street', 'drunk', 'Chinaski', 'point', 'life', 'least', 'maintenance', 'drinker', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'times', 'day', 'attempt', 'working', 'carrying', 'women', 'real', 'love', 'writing', 'do', 'daily.Several', 'things', 'Factotum', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'First', 'Bukowski', 'lived', 'most', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'director', 'Hamer', 'unwisely', 'decided', 'base', 'story', 'nowheres-ville', 'USA', 'Bukowski', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Fante', 'example', 'L.A.', 'Factotum', 'ersatz', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'disconcerting', 'best', 'fake', 'worst', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Minneapolis', 'several', 'shots', 'skyline', 'downtown', 'L.A.', 'Occidental', 'Tower', 'Eastern', 'Columbia', 'Building', 'other', 'times', ""isn't.Secondly"", 'film', 'just', 'not', 'skuzzy', 'enough', 'reflect', 'world', 'Bukowski', 'Dillon', 'hard', 'attain', 'sort', 'ironic', 'intelligent', 'detached', 'debauched', 'manner', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'pull', 'off', 'film', 'slightly', 'center', 'off', 'plumb.Lili', 'Taylor', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'other', 'hand', 'do', 'pull', 'off', 'play', 'major', 'drunks', 'who', 'are', 'woefully', 'promiscuous', 'display', 'softness', 'tragic', 'vulnerability', 'realistic', 'intelligent', 'view', 'life', 'performances', 'transcendent', 'Dillon', 'good', 'times', 'dull', 'too', 'often', 'performance', 'just', 'performance', 'faking', 'course', 'acting', 'here', 'therein', 'problem.Norwegian', 'director', 'Bent', 'Hamer', 'good', 'eye', 'good', 'sense', 'what', 'material', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'detached', 'objective', 'when', 'what', 'movie', 'sleazy', 'sloppy', 'over-the-top', 'melodrama', 'even', 'slice', 'Bukowski', 'life', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'blunt', 'axe', 'not', 'surgery', 'sharp', 'scalpel']",Factotum

In Factotum, we witness Hank's slumming around from job to job with no sense of direction, other than getting drunk and writing short stories.  His lengthy affair with his drinking equal Jan (Lili Taylor) only fuels his inner-demons, all of which is captured by Norwegian director Bent Hamer.  Dillon is good as Chinaski, nicely capturing most of Bukowski's own spirit in the role.  Lili Taylor however wonderfully downplays her role as Jan; a character that like Chinaski we can loathe and sympathize with on a more than consistent basis.  Even Marisa Tomei in a brief but memorable role manages to shine.  Where Factotum falters is mainly with the script and direction from Bent Hamer.  While most of the personality and bleakness that Bukowski put to paper is here, but there is just something in the film that makes it feel kind of empty.  Maybe it's just that Bukowski's work just doesn't translate well to film, or maybe it's something else.

I'm having a great deal of difficulty putting my finger on the problems, but ill try my best.  First, there were too many changes in the movie versus the text.  It didn't follow the book very well; it was a loose interpretation.  Secondly, the movie takes place in modern times.  The book took place in the 40's (if memory serves correct).  Changing the setting so dramatically is unsettling for someone familiar with the text.  The people and places you picture from the novel now cannot exist in he same way in this film.  Finally, the movie is very flat.  Matt Dillon's performance is flat.  Chinaski's personality barely comes out - we dont get any of the inner-dialogue, the thoughts, the interpretation and explanation of events that Chinaski offers in the book.  Instead, we get Matt Dillon grunting and maybe talking a little.  He doesnt come across as interesting at all, he comes across as a dullard who cannot carry on a conversation.  Also, you never get the feel for the real level of poverty Chinaski had in the book (he was living on one candy bar per day for part of the story).  The blue-collar lowlifes he interacts with don't seem real, they don't have any memorable personality.  Factotum is a hard book to translate to film, since such a large part is seeing the events as Chinaski sees them, not the dull events themselves.

1019705,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B000ICL3NI,Robin Friedman,"[20, 22]","Factotum is based upon the 1975 novel by the American writer Charles Bukowski (1920 -  1994).  The movie was shot in Minnesota in 2004 and premiered at several independent film festivals before its commercial release.  The best-known earlier movie based upon Bukowski's work was Barfly (1987) which stared Mickey Rourke.I looked forward to seeing Factotum for a long time, and I wasn't disappointed.  The major character is Henry Chinaski, a character who figures in many Bukowski novels and stories and who is based loosly on Bukowski's own life. Matt Dillon gives a stunning performance of Chinaski, as does Lili Taylor, as Chinaski's on-again off-again girlfriend Jan.Although the movie was shot in Minnesota, the scene of the movie is the poorer sections of Los Angeles during the years of WW II. Chinaski, a loner, outsider and drifter rejected for military service, is fired from one menial job after another as he works toward becoming a writer.  Chinaski drinks heavily, gambles at the racetrack, fights, and moves from woman to woman.  The low life of the movie is convincingly portrayed; yet Chinaski perseveres and ultimately succeeds in his goal of becoming a writer.The movie differs from the novel in that the movie is set entirely in Los Angeles.  In Bukowski's novel, Chinaski wanders back and forth around the United States.  Thus, the novel  begins in New Orleans, as Chinaski heads West to Los Angeles, and then backtracks through New York City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis before drifting back to Los Angeles.  The book is thus substantially more episodic and less focused that the film adaptation. In addition, the film portrays Chinaski somewhat more sympathetically than does Bukowski's own text.  For example in one scene, after Chinaski and Jan have walked some distance to pick up a check when Chinaski is fired from a job, Jan complains that she can't walk further and takes of her high heels.  In the movie, Chinaski gallantly offers her his own shoes.  This offer doesn't happen in the novel.  The Minnesota scene of the movie doesn't quite look like Los Angeles, but it does capture the seedy, squalid character of Chinaski's surroundings.In watching the movie, my companion commented on the lurid quality of the lighting, particularly as it involved the bar scenes.  Another unusual feature of the movie is the outstanding musical score, which sets several of Bukoski's poems.This is a tough, gritty movie of an individual who is seemingly headed for a life of alcoholism and failure.  Chinaski somehow redeems himself as he works towards becoming a writer.  I think the book and the movie both illustrate a traditional theme.  They show how art and reflection have the power to find beauty in even the most sordid scenes and to bring meaning to a life in the midst of waste and sorrow.Robin Friedman",5,Factotum  -- The Movie,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,2831,"['Factotum', 'based', '1975', 'novel', 'American', 'writer', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', '1920', '1994', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Minnesota', '2004', 'premiered', 'several', 'independent', 'film', 'festivals', 'commercial', 'release', 'best-known', 'earlier', 'movie', 'based', 'Bukowski', 'work', 'was', 'Barfly', '1987', 'stared', 'Mickey', 'Rourke.I', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Factotum', 'long', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'major', 'character', 'Henry', 'Chinaski', 'character', 'who', 'many', 'Bukowski', 'novels', 'stories', 'who', 'based', 'loosly', 'Bukowski', 'own', 'life', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Chinaski', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Chinaski', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'girlfriend', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Minnesota', 'scene', 'movie', 'poorer', 'sections', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'years', 'WW', 'II', 'Chinaski', 'loner', 'outsider', 'drifter', 'rejected', 'military', 'service', 'fired', 'one', 'menial', 'job', 'becoming', 'writer', 'Chinaski', 'heavily', 'gambles', 'racetrack', 'fights', 'moves', 'woman', 'woman', 'low', 'life', 'movie', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'Chinaski', 'perseveres', 'ultimately', 'goal', 'becoming', 'writer.The', 'movie', 'differs', 'novel', 'movie', 'set', 'entirely', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Bukowski', 'novel', 'Chinaski', 'back', 'forth', 'United', 'States', 'Thus', 'novel', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Chinaski', 'West', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'then', 'backtracks', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Philadelphia', 'St.', 'Louis', 'drifting', 'back', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'book', 'thus', 'substantially', 'more', 'episodic', 'less', 'focused', 'film', 'adaptation', 'addition', 'film', 'Chinaski', 'somewhat', 'more', 'sympathetically', 'Bukowski', 'own', 'text', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'Chinaski', 'Jan', 'have', 'walked', 'distance', 'pick', 'up', 'check', 'when', 'Chinaski', 'fired', 'job', 'Jan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'further', 'high', 'heels', 'movie', 'Chinaski', 'gallantly', 'own', 'shoes', 'offer', ""n't"", 'happen', 'novel', 'Minnesota', 'scene', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'look', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'capture', 'seedy', 'squalid', 'character', 'Chinaski', 'surroundings.In', 'watching', 'movie', 'companion', 'commented', 'lurid', 'quality', 'lighting', 'particularly', 'involved', 'bar', 'scenes', 'unusual', 'feature', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'musical', 'score', 'several', 'Bukoski', 'poems.This', 'tough', 'gritty', 'movie', 'individual', 'who', 'seemingly', 'headed', 'life', 'alcoholism', 'failure', 'Chinaski', 'somehow', 'towards', 'becoming', 'writer', 'think', 'book', 'movie', 'illustrate', 'traditional', 'theme', 'show', 'how', 'art', 'reflection', 'have', 'power', 'find', 'beauty', 'even', 'most', 'sordid', 'scenes', 'bring', 'meaning', 'life', 'midst', 'waste', 'sorrow.Robin', 'Friedman']",Factotum

Chinaski is the lowest of the semi-functioning drunks, barely able to keep himself in seedy hotels and in liquor.The movie centers around seedy bars and seedy people. Chinaski's struggles as a writer are only touched upon and not delved into. There's no budding poet or tragic talent underlying his alcoholism. The closest he comes to poetics, IMHO, is where he tells his ex-boss openly that he really needs his last check typed out now because he needs to get drunk.  Though he claims to be a writer and seeks employment as a reporter (and even hints at having a college degree) Matt doean't talk about his work, not even when invited to.  The best jobs he can find are ice crushing, a pickle factory, a bike repair shop, maintenence, but no matter what his work, the drink always comes first.'Factotum' is saved by the acting and the ability of the costume designer to turn Matt Dillon (Hank), Lili Taylor (Jan), and Marisa Tormei (Laura) into sleazy characters who look rode hard and put out wet in each and every scene. The script is mellow, without any highs or lows to it. The movie is quieter than 'Leaving Las Vegas', or the hard hitting 'Requiem For A Dream', and without any of the comedic relief from 'Spun', but it manages to hold it's own with its compelling invitation into a more realistic portrayal of the everyday alcoholic, living in every city.Even if you love addiction movies like I do, or love Dillon or Tormei, your enjoyment of the film will increase tenfold.  For a quiet, laid back movie 'Factotum' holds a lot of punch to it.  It's a movie you may want to view twice to capture the subtlness of Hank and Jan's decay.  Though it lacks any real excitement, the characters grew on me and its become a favorite.  I highly recommend this movie, especially to fans like me of addiction films and books.

Short, curtailed scenes, which perfectly capture the character of Chinaski - a writer of the hard knock, raw school and also the mean honesty of Bukowski's prose.The plot is slimline. Little happens apart from Chinaski going from one job to another and falling in and out of cohabitation with fellow alcoholic girlfriend Jan (Lili Taylor). In one great scene, they both get up from their disgusting bed to alternately vomit into the toilet, then light up cigarettes to continue the cycle of self abuse.The most poignant scenes are those where Chinaski sits writing at a table. A big man, burly and masculine, hunched over a yellow legal pad, drinking and smoking while forcing out his sentences with a pen cramped in his left hand. The writer struggling against all odds, writing three stories a week and achieving nothing but firmly committed to his way of doing things. At his lowest ebb, he goes home, only to be scorned by his father and thrown out of the house.

1019710,A1IWVIOBEMZ5OQ,B000ICL3NI,Timothy D. Naegele,"[18, 21]","So many people said after this year's Academy Awards that Matt Dillon should have won an Oscar as best supporting actor for his performance in ""Crash.""  Perhaps so, but he deserves an Oscar even more as best actor for ""Factotum,"" without a doubt.  It is an offbeat movie that is not for the kids, but the camera captures the best acting that Dillon has ever done.  Even with a beard and somewhat of a paunch, he radiates star power more so than in his other films.First and foremost, IFC Films should be pushing for his nomination.  The reviews are terrific, by and large; and it should be opened nationwide, not just in art house theaters.  This is a ""sleeper"" gem of a film.  Along with an Oscar nod for Dillon might come one for Lili Taylor because she is terrific too.  Clearly, ""Factotum"" is an Indie film that has come out of nowhere, ground zero in fact, and might be marked for ""stardom"" if IFC puts some ""muscle"" behind the film in terms of marketing and promoting it.In turn, its success might propel lots of independent filmmakers to ""believe"" that they too might ""reach for the stars"" and actually catch the brass ring.  Dillon is a real talent, and so is Taylor.  Marisa Tomei has a small but meaty part, and she handles it with aplomb as she always does.  For those of us who fell in love with her years ago, when she won an Oscar as best supporting actress in ""My Cousin Vinny,"" she shines in this movie too.Even though Dillon's character, ""Henry Chinaski,"" is an alcoholic and a womanizer who seems to fail miserably at all of his jobs, the one thread that keeps him alive and moving forward is his writing, which is ultimately his redemption--as it was for writer Charles Bukowski, on whose book the film was based.  The only minor criticism of the movie might be that it needs some music in various scenes, and the end credits need to be redone to achieve greater clarity because they are impossible to read in a theater.",4,Matt Dillon deserves an Oscar,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,1939,"['So', 'many', 'people', 'said', 'year', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'performance', 'Crash', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'Oscar', 'even', 'more', 'best', 'actor', 'Factotum', 'doubt', 'offbeat', 'movie', 'not', 'kids', 'camera', 'best', 'acting', 'Dillon', 'ever', 'done', 'Even', 'beard', 'somewhat', 'paunch', 'star', 'power', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'films.First', 'foremost', 'IFC', 'Films', 'should', 'be', 'pushing', 'nomination', 'reviews', 'are', 'terrific', 'large', 'should', 'be', 'opened', 'nationwide', 'not', 'just', 'art', 'house', 'theaters', 'sleeper', 'gem', 'film', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Dillon', 'might', 'come', 'one', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'terrific', 'too', 'Clearly', 'Factotum', 'Indie', 'film', 'come', 'nowhere', 'ground', 'zero', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'marked', 'stardom', 'IFC', 'muscle', 'film', 'terms', 'marketing', 'promoting', 'it.In', 'turn', 'success', 'might', 'propel', 'lots', 'independent', 'filmmakers', 'believe', 'too', 'might', 'reach', 'stars', 'actually', 'catch', 'brass', 'ring', 'Dillon', 'real', 'talent', 'so', 'Taylor', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'small', 'meaty', 'part', 'aplomb', 'always', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'movie', 'too.Even', 'Dillon', 'character', 'Henry', 'Chinaski', 'alcoholic', 'womanizer', 'who', 'fail', 'miserably', 'jobs', 'one', 'thread', 'alive', 'moving', 'forward', 'writing', 'ultimately', 'redemption', 'was', 'writer', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'only', 'minor', 'criticism', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'music', 'various', 'scenes', 'end', 'credits', 'need', 'be', 'redone', 'achieve', 'greater', 'clarity', 'are', 'impossible', 'read', 'theater']",Factotum
