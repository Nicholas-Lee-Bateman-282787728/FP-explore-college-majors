I was lucky and privileged enough to see this film when the director showed it at a special screening at my university, a small intimate crowd in one of the rooms in the East Asian wing of the foreign language building.  She really went to a lot of hard work to research Sugihara's life and to bring that story to life.Sugihara was a Japanese diplomat who was stationed in Lithuania on the eve of WWII, when a number of people from Poland had recently fled there.  They, as well as many native Lithuanians, were desperate to leave Europe, or at least the part occupied by the Nazis, before it was too late.  Even knowing he was breaking a lot of regulations and rules, Sugihara kept issuing visas, even having to forge them sometimes.  Even as his train was pulling out of the station when he was recalled because of his behavior, he was still writing visas for people clinging onto the train, and he continued making out visas in the hotel he arrived at afterwards.  The visas were written for the Dutch-controlled Curaco, but none of the people ever made it that far.  They were able to travel to Japan, the alleged stopping-off point, but were able to stay there for the entire war.  In all, he wrote about 2,500 visas, including ones for the entire Mir Yeshiva.  Because he had broken the rules and written these visas without authorisation, Sugihara was dismissed from his job when he returned to Japan in 1947, and spent most of the rest of his life doing odd jobs.  It wasn't till late in his life that he was finally recognised for the heroic thing he'd done, and like many people whom Yad Vashem has honored, felt he hadn't done anything special, but had only done what was right, what was expected, what a normal compassionate decent human being should do in such circumstances.  This documentary does true justice to him, narrating a story about an ordinary human being who acted heroically in extraordinary circumstances.",5,The only Japanese Righteous Gentile,1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,2074,"['date', 'Chiune', 'Sugihara', 'only', 'Japanese', 'person', 'who', 'been', 'recognised', 'Yad', 'Vashem', 'being', 'one', 'Righteous', 'Nations', 'was', 'lucky', 'privileged', 'enough', 'see', 'film', 'when', 'director', 'showed', 'special', 'screening', 'university', 'small', 'intimate', 'crowd', 'one', 'rooms', 'East', 'Asian', 'wing', 'foreign', 'language', 'building', 'really', 'went', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'research', 'Sugihara', 'life', 'bring', 'story', 'life.Sugihara', 'was', 'Japanese', 'diplomat', 'who', 'was', 'stationed', 'Lithuania', 'eve', 'WWII', 'when', 'number', 'people', 'Poland', 'had', 'recently', 'fled', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'native', 'Lithuanians', 'were', 'desperate', 'leave', 'Europe', 'least', 'part', 'occupied', 'Nazis', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'Even', 'knowing', 'was', 'breaking', 'lot', 'regulations', 'rules', 'Sugihara', 'kept', 'issuing', 'visas', 'even', 'having', 'forge', 'sometimes', 'Even', 'train', 'was', 'pulling', 'station', 'when', 'was', 'recalled', 'behavior', 'was', 'still', 'writing', 'visas', 'people', 'clinging', 'train', 'continued', 'making', 'out', 'visas', 'hotel', 'arrived', 'afterwards', 'visas', 'were', 'written', 'Dutch-controlled', 'Curaco', 'none', 'people', 'ever', 'made', 'far', 'were', 'able', 'travel', 'Japan', 'alleged', 'stopping-off', 'point', 'were', 'able', 'stay', 'there', 'entire', 'war', 'wrote', '2,500', 'visas', 'including', 'ones', 'entire', 'Mir', 'Yeshiva', 'had', 'broken', 'rules', 'written', 'visas', 'authorisation', 'Sugihara', 'was', 'dismissed', 'job', 'when', 'returned', 'Japan', '1947', 'spent', 'most', 'rest', 'life', 'doing', 'odd', 'jobs', 'was', ""n't"", 'till', 'late', 'life', 'was', 'finally', 'recognised', 'heroic', 'thing', ""'d"", 'done', 'many', 'people', 'whom', 'Yad', 'Vashem', 'honored', 'felt', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'special', 'had', 'only', 'done', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'what', 'normal', 'compassionate', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'should', 'do', 'such', 'circumstances', 'documentary', 'true', 'justice', 'narrating', 'story', 'ordinary', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'acted', 'heroically', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances']",Sugihara - Conspiracy of Kindness

He demonstrated courage and compassion when both were sorely needed.One seemingly small incident set the wheels in motion for Sugihara's mission to save lives during the Second World War.  When he lent money to a young boy who was in dire need, the boy invited the Sugiharas to celebrate Hanukkah with his family.Chiune Sugihara, when lighting the traditional candle is moved by the plight of his kind host family, living amidst anti-Semitism and cruelty in Lithuania.  His lighting that candle would in turn spark his determination to save as many lives as he could.  He became that ray of light to many during the Dark Days of the Holocaust.Sugihara was a diplomat from Japan stationed in Lithuania in 1940.  A gifted, multilingual man, he was well suited for his government post.  At the time he had three small sons and other relatives living in the same house.  Crowds of people regularly gathered at his door, imploring him to help them escape the atrocities of the Holocaust.  Sugihara wrote the Japanese Consulate imploring them to issue visas to the Eastern Europeans.  He was turned down each time, so he took matters into his own hands.  He wrote out visas and signed each one personally.  He stayed up far into the night for many nights issuing visas and ensuring the safety of those who received them.  Upon handing each person their visa, he wished them well.In 1940, the Germans and Russians had occupied Lithuania.  By the time they had arrived, many of their would be prisoners had escaped, seeking asylum in Japan courtesy of Chiune Sugihara.By the close of the war, Sugihara had to say goodbye to his family to work in Russia.  He naturally feared for his life, so he worked in Russia under an alias.  He lived in squalor and subsisted on boiled potatoes.Over the years, Chiune Sugihara wondered about the fates of the people whose lives he had saved.  In this film, the son of a Sugihara Survivor thanks Sugihara's wife.  Expect this very moving scene to make you cry.Hearing this story of compassion told and seeing the faces of the people directly involved makes this very compelling.  It is far better to be a good person than a hero; a good person acts out of their heart and conscience and is guided by compassion whereas heroes are more often than not regarded as superhuman; are often warriors and/or war casualties and heroes seek personal return and accolades which fly in the face of geniune compassion.  Chiune Sugihara lived by Pete Seeger's credo which is inscribed on Pete Seeger's banjo: ""This instrument surrounds hatred with love and destroys it.""  Chiune Sugihara, by his acts of selfless compassion with no thought of praise or return surrounded hatred, enmity and cruelty with love and amity and destroyed it.  In so doing, he saved the lives of thousands of people.You'll also want to readPassage to Freedom: The Sugihara StoryandThe Miracle VisasandIn Search of Sugihara: The Elusive Japanese Diplomat Who Risked his Life to Rescue 10,000 Jews From the Holocaust",5,Being a Good Person is Far Better Than Being a Hero,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,3058,"['Chiune', 'Sugihara', '1900-1986', 'was', 'truly', 'good', 'person', 'demonstrated', 'courage', 'compassion', 'when', 'were', 'sorely', 'needed.One', 'seemingly', 'small', 'incident', 'set', 'wheels', 'motion', 'Sugihara', 'mission', 'save', 'lives', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'When', 'lent', 'money', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'dire', 'need', 'boy', 'invited', 'Sugiharas', 'celebrate', 'Hanukkah', 'family.Chiune', 'Sugihara', 'when', 'lighting', 'traditional', 'candle', 'moved', 'plight', 'kind', 'host', 'family', 'living', 'amidst', 'anti-Semitism', 'cruelty', 'Lithuania', 'lighting', 'candle', 'would', 'turn', 'spark', 'determination', 'save', 'many', 'lives', 'could', 'became', 'ray', 'light', 'many', 'Dark', 'Days', 'Holocaust.Sugihara', 'was', 'diplomat', 'Japan', 'stationed', 'Lithuania', '1940', 'gifted', 'multilingual', 'man', 'was', 'well', 'suited', 'government', 'post', 'time', 'had', 'three', 'small', 'sons', 'other', 'relatives', 'living', 'same', 'house', 'Crowds', 'people', 'regularly', 'gathered', 'door', 'imploring', 'help', 'escape', 'atrocities', 'Holocaust', 'Sugihara', 'wrote', 'Japanese', 'Consulate', 'imploring', 'issue', 'visas', 'Eastern', 'Europeans', 'was', 'turned', 'down', 'time', 'took', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'wrote', 'out', 'visas', 'signed', 'one', 'personally', 'stayed', 'up', 'far', 'night', 'many', 'nights', 'issuing', 'visas', 'ensuring', 'safety', 'who', 'received', 'handing', 'person', 'visa', 'wished', 'well.In', '1940', 'Germans', 'Russians', 'had', 'occupied', 'Lithuania', 'time', 'had', 'arrived', 'many', 'would', 'be', 'prisoners', 'had', 'escaped', 'seeking', 'asylum', 'Japan', 'courtesy', 'Chiune', 'Sugihara.By', 'close', 'war', 'Sugihara', 'had', 'say', 'goodbye', 'family', 'work', 'Russia', 'naturally', 'feared', 'life', 'worked', 'Russia', 'alias', 'lived', 'squalor', 'subsisted', 'boiled', 'years', 'Chiune', 'Sugihara', 'wondered', 'fates', 'people', 'lives', 'had', 'saved', 'film', 'son', 'Sugihara', 'Survivor', 'Sugihara', 'wife', 'Expect', 'very', 'moving', 'scene', 'make', 'cry.Hearing', 'story', 'compassion', 'told', 'seeing', 'people', 'directly', 'involved', 'very', 'compelling', 'far', 'better', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'hero', 'good', 'person', 'heart', 'conscience', 'guided', 'compassion', 'whereas', 'heroes', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'regarded', 'superhuman', 'are', 'often', 'warriors', 'and/or', 'war', 'casualties', 'heroes', 'seek', 'personal', 'return', 'accolades', 'fly', 'face', 'geniune', 'compassion', 'Chiune', 'Sugihara', 'lived', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'credo', 'inscribed', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'banjo', 'instrument', 'hatred', 'love', 'Chiune', 'Sugihara', 'acts', 'selfless', 'compassion', 'thought', 'praise', 'return', 'surrounded', 'hatred', 'enmity', 'cruelty', 'love', 'amity', 'destroyed', 'so', 'doing', 'saved', 'lives', 'thousands', 'people.You', ""'ll"", 'also', 'want', 'readPassage', 'Freedom', 'Sugihara', 'StoryandThe', 'Miracle', 'VisasandIn', 'Search', 'Sugihara', 'Elusive', 'Japanese', 'Diplomat', 'Who', 'Risked', 'Life', 'Rescue', '10,000', 'Jews', 'Holocaust']",Sugihara - Conspiracy of Kindness

It comforting to know even within the heinous horrors of WW2 such compassion and decency existed.To thank Sugihara for a nice deed, a jewish family invites him over for their Hanukah celebration. He is touched by the candle lighting ceremony. Sugihara who before this event knew little about Judaism would subsequently work to save 10,000 Jews from the ensuing Holocaust.After the war Sugihara had to leave his family to work in Russia, under an assumed name (as he was fearful the Russians would not allow him to enter if they knew he was a prior diplomatic officer who manuevered against Russia). He living conditions were so bad that his son lamented that when he went to visit, Sugihara was reduced to eating potatoes boiled in a little pot above the toilet.He was recognized for his deeds only very late in life as no one knew he was in Russia under an assumed name. The most touching moment in the movie is when the son of a Sugihara survivor comes to pay his respects to Sugihara's wife and breaks down in tears as he thanks her for her husband efforts. It would be hard for anyone to keep their eyes dry at this moment.This amazing story is told very well via a combination of reenactments, narratives and interviews.
