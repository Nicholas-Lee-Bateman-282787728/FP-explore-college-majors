981208,AIXHGNP13HPXJ,B000F0V0LS,"B. Jones ""movie nut""","[2, 7]","Let me begin by saying that I don't really think that this is a five star movie.  But Amazon uses a reviewer average, and I felt that the average of this one really should be closer to three stars rather than what it is.It is important to note before ever seeing Brainiac Attacks that this isn't a continuation of Superman the Animated Series.  There are many things that occur that are inconsistent to that series, which makes it much better to simply view this one as a stand alone movie.  Some examples of what I am talking about are:1. When Lex Luther and Brainiac first meet in this movie it is played as though they have never met before, even though they actually met the first time Brainiac came to Earth. Brainiac says something to the effect that he saw data about Luther in a download, which should have been unnecessary since they did meet before.2. Luther is a completely different character than he was in the series.  He was a very serious man, much more threatening.  The Luther in this movie is more of a comic character, leaving room for Brainiac to be the truly intimidating villian of the movie.3. When Brainiac enters Superman's Fortress of Solitude, he gets all excited about being able to download all the knowledge of Krypton from Superman's console, something that Brainiac shouldn't have to do since he comes from Krypton himself.So this movie doesn't continue the animated series.  It may feature the same animated look, and some of the original voices, but it takes everything in a new direction.  That doesn't, however, mean that it is bad.  Looked at in this perspective I feel it is a fairly decent movie.  The action sequences are good.  The story doesn't drag; it keeps you interested throughout.  The grips I have with it are some of the moments of ""comedy"" that they felt that had to throw in that I felt were reminisent of those terrible Superman movie sequels (III, IV, and parts of the original Lester version of II).  But just like the original Lester version of Superman II, it does have its good points that overshadow its bad points and make it an overall fun movie.  Expectations are everything when watching a movie, so if you deside to watch this one come to it with the right perspective.  It isn't as good as Superman the animated series, and it doesn't even come close to the Justice League.  But it is fun in its way and I think you will enjoy it if you view it in this light.",5,Not a continuation...,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,2425,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'five', 'star', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'average', 'felt', 'average', 'one', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'closer', 'three', 'stars', 'rather', 'what', 'important', 'note', 'ever', 'seeing', 'Brainiac', 'Attacks', ""n't"", 'continuation', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'occur', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'series', 'much', 'better', 'simply', 'view', 'one', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'examples', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'are:1', 'When', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'Brainiac', 'first', 'movie', 'played', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'even', 'actually', 'met', 'first', 'time', 'Brainiac', 'came', 'Earth', 'Brainiac', 'something', 'effect', 'saw', 'data', 'Luther', 'download', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'unnecessary', 'did', 'meet', 'before.2', 'Luther', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'serious', 'man', 'much', 'more', 'threatening', 'Luther', 'movie', 'more', 'comic', 'character', 'leaving', 'room', 'Brainiac', 'be', 'truly', 'intimidating', 'villian', 'movie.3', 'When', 'Brainiac', 'Superman', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'all', 'excited', 'being', 'able', 'download', 'knowledge', 'Krypton', 'Superman', 'console', 'something', 'Brainiac', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'Krypton', 'himself.So', 'movie', ""n't"", 'continue', 'animated', 'series', 'may', 'feature', 'same', 'animated', 'look', 'original', 'voices', 'everything', 'new', 'direction', ""n't"", 'however', 'mean', 'bad', 'Looked', 'perspective', 'feel', 'fairly', 'decent', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'good', 'story', ""n't"", 'drag', 'interested', 'grips', 'have', 'are', 'moments', 'comedy', 'felt', 'had', 'throw', 'felt', 'were', 'reminisent', 'terrible', 'Superman', 'movie', 'sequels', 'III', 'IV', 'parts', 'original', 'Lester', 'version', 'II', 'just', 'original', 'Lester', 'version', 'Superman', 'II', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'overshadow', 'bad', 'points', 'make', 'overall', 'fun', 'movie', 'Expectations', 'are', 'everything', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'so', 'deside', 'watch', 'one', 'come', 'right', 'perspective', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Superman', 'animated', 'series', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Justice', 'League', 'fun', 'way', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'view', 'light']",N/A

It's got a great story, awesome action sequences; in fact you can't help but wonder how the heck Metropolis is still standing after the mega fight between Superman & Braniac, plus seeing a more comedic side to Lex Luthor was a nice touch & unexpected. I enjoyed the plot that's basically Superman racing against the clock to save a dying Lois Lane while being at a crossroads as to whether continue his crusade or abandon it altogether to reveal his true identity to Lois.

I think that most people would expect that a movie would be of higher quality than the television show but then most people would be incorrect. Brainiac Attacks is sort of a perfect storm of badness that combines horrible voice acting, lousy scripting, sub par animation and a lifeless plot. At the eye of the garbage storm sits the single worst portrayal of Lex Luthor ever in any media. Supposedly the movie takes place in a slightly different universe than the animated series and apparently in this universe Luthor is a worthless buffoon. I've actually never been a huge fan of Clancy Brown's voice acting in the animated series but Powers Boothe's irritating whine made me long for Brown's lower, more dignified vocal tone. Powers Boothe did the voice work for the Ultra Humanite in Justice League Unlimited and seemed fine but here it's just awful. When you combine Luthor's completely inappropriate voice with the terrible dialogue it just becomes painful. Who in there right mind thought that Luthor would say things like, ""yadda, yadda, yadda"" or ""break out the tiki torches"" or call Brainiac ""Brainy Babe""? Brainiac is also left to suffer. I was always a big fan of Brainiac's voice in the Challenge of the Superfriends with his flat, emotionless tone.  Here they decided to go with a name actor, Lance Hendrikson, and give Brainiac a little more character. After Luthor builds Brainiac a new shell, Brainiac says to Superman, ""I've been keeping pace with current trends in technology"" uh huh. Also, the three connected dots on his forehead light up one at a time making a sound like a pinball machine stripping away his last shred of dignity.I have to admit that this movie does sometimes reach the level of so bad it's good. My favorite part was after Superman and Lois get blasted with Brainiac's Kryptonite pulse beam and for some strange reason get raccoon eyes. I guess it's supposed to show that the Kryptonite is having an affect on their bodies but for quite a bit of the movie they have raccoon eyes and when Superman changes to Clark he still has the raccoon eyes. I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous they looked. This is like the worst episode of Superman TAS except triple length. The only way this one could be enjoyed is with copious amounts of alcohol which means it's inappropriate for kids.

I say fortunate because I was actually thinking about buying it on its release date.  Now I know not to.  Right off the bat I'll say this: If you loved Superman the Animated series or the JLU, save your money, do NOT buy this and put that hard earned 20 bucks towards one of those titles that come out on the same day because if you do buy this you will be mad at yourself for doing it about 10 minutes into the movie.This is a Superman cartoon without the dignity or maturity that the series had.  What made the animated series for me was that it was successful storytelling.  It took the classic story of Superman and reinterpreted it just slightly enough to make it it's own and influence the genre.  Where the series  took three steps forward this animated movie took four steps back.Like other reviewers have noted, the voices of Lex and Brainiac have been recast.  Cold, determined, business like Lex is gone and the emotionless monotone Brainiac is no more. Brainiac made jokes.  Brainiac shouldn't joke.  What we have here are wacky, silly, pun-cracking villains from cheesy Saturday morning cartoons.  What's even worse is that the jokes are bad and the puns are awful.The Lex portrayed in this animated movie is very similar to the smiling, jovial Gene Hackman Lex from the animated Superman movies. The problem is if you are a fan of this series your brain just can't wrap around this concept.  I found myself watching this and saying to myself "" No really, what is this?  This is the new Superman flick?  Naw... common... this has got to be a funny cartoon network thing... where's Seth Green?  Ashton?  Have I been punked?"" I want to go watch ALIENS tonight on DVD just to see Lance Henriksen get torn to shreds over and over and over again as punishment for doing what he did to Brainiac.WB must have chosen to scrap basing these villains on their roots in hopes of scooping up a younger audience.  I wouldn't have been surprised if Scooby and the Gang had made a cameo to bust Lex's scheme.  The Superfriends Lex is more menacing and deep than this Lex could EVER hope to be.A final thing you should know is that the script is just plain awful.  Again, if you've watched the series you naturally expect for the film to have a certain pace and direction and it disappoints.  Really they should have just animated this in a different style, recast all the voices and made it it's own entity.  Because it is nothing like the Superman we've come to know and love.If you're buying this for little kids who haven't seen Superman before, sure, why not, they might like it.

The action was there, however, Duane Capizzi does an even bigger hatchet job on Superman via the storyline than he did on The Batman series...Lex Luthor cracking jokes? Braniac showing a sense of emotion? Get real? Powers Boothe, known for his portrayal of Jim Jones in the Guyana Tragedy, would've made a perfect replacement as Lex Luthor had it not been for the mediocre sense of humor...Boothe was abused in my opinion, and Lance Henriksen would've been perfect for any role but Braniac's...the original voice talent reminded me of Mr. Freeze from the 90's Batman series...cold, calloused, calculated, no emtions,etc...Braniac, in this film was laughing. No way.To make a long story short, this one's only for die hard fans of Superman vol. 1-3 and for completists like myself. Otheriwse, you may want to rent this one first.

Tucker ""datashogun""","[9, 9]","I picked this up before reading the reviews (big mistake!) because the Superman TAS and Justice League series have been so strong.  I have since read some of the other reviews, and I agree with the criticism this ""movie"" has received. I just want to make a few points in the hopes that some of you will avoid my mistake.*The voice acting was TERRIBLE.  As was noted earlier, Superman and Lois are voiced by Tim Daly and Dana Delany, but Lex sounds terrible!*The plot and dialog are possibly the worst I've ever seen in an animated series--and I've seen real winners like ""Pokemon"" and ""Pac-Man"".  This, combined with the recasting of key voices, the overall effect makes a viewer think that the show isn't actually part of the Batman/Superman/JL continuity. Put more bluntly, this is so bad, you don't think you're actually watching Superman--it feels like you're actually watching some kid's animation project.*Nothing new is introduced, and nothing changes with the character. I thought about this for a long time, and this story lacks any dialog or plot elements that would place it in any kind of sequence with the other stories. We don't see any critters in Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Lex Luthor makes no references to his relationship with Brainiac. Lois' remarks about Superman don't indicate how close she's been with him. (WARNING: SPOILER!) In fact, Superman's big revelation is that Lois likes danger whether he's around or not! He's just figuring that out NOW?!? (END OF SPOILER)If you're thinking that you still want to suffer through this experience to see for yourself, please understand this: I could write PAGES detailing just how bad this is.

981228,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000F0V0LS,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 6]","Approximately 6 years after the end of the Warner Brothers' ""Superman:  The Animated Series"" and months after Cartoon Network wrapped up the final season of ""Justice League Unlimited"", the WB felt it was time to tap into the `Man of Steel' for another adventure, conveniently around the time ""Superman Returns"" was set to debut in theaters.""Superman:  Braniac Attacks"" begins with Lex Luthor (voiced by Powers Boothe) becoming increasingly angered by Superman's (voiced by Tim Daly) heroic successes and rising popularity amongst the masses of Metropolis.  Lex proceeds to form a dangerous alliance with the villain known as Braniac (voiced by Lance Henriksen), using advanced weaponry and a unique strain of Kryptonite, Lex retrofits Braniac with a new body that will allow him to defeat the `Man of Steel'.  However, Lex fails to realize that Braniac isn't going to just obey Lex's orders, instead he has his own plans for Superman and the rest of the world.  To stop these two villains, Superman must use all his abilities and even brave a trip into the mysterious Phantom Zone before all hope is lost.After Warner Brothers decided on making this movie, essentially as a tie-in to the release of Bryan Singer's epic ""Superman Returns"", they were faced with a small quandry.  Who would voice `The Last Son of Krypton'?  In ""Superman:  The Animated Series"" the voice of Superman was provided by actor Tim Daly; however, in ""Justice League Unlimited"" the character's voice was that of actor George Newbern.  So, which actor would bring our hero to life, in the end the choice was made to bring back Tim Daly, which made sense because this movie was to be a spin-off of Superman's own animated series rather than ""Justice League Unlimited"".  Though the choice to bring Tim Daly back as the voice for Superman, along with Dana Delany as Lois Lane made perfect sense, one decision that made no sense was the recasting of the voice for Lex Luthor (previously voiced by Clancy Brown in both ""Superman:  The Animated Series"" and ""Justice League Unlimited""), in ""Superman:  Braniac Attacks"" they chose to use actor Powers Boothe (""Sin City"" and ""Sudden Death"").  Though Boothe is a solid actor, and had Clancy Brown's voice not been so recognizable as Lex's, the choice to make the switch wouldn't have been that bad, but after almost a decade of the same actor voicing the character, I can't help but question the logic here.The movie as a whole was only average, truthfully I expected much more from this film.  Again, this was due to the fact that the writing for both animated series' was of such high quality that anything less is disappointing.  For some reason, the creators of either animated series were not used in any way, so the tone feels completely different, and for the most part the movie appears to be aimed at little kids rather than both kids and adults as the other series' have been.  Really the first half of the movie is somewhat childish, with stupid little one-liners or lame jokes by Lex or other characters, but the second half really brings the story together, and it begins to feel focused and more mature in tone.  The animation was solid for the most part, a few sequences were weak and felt rushed, but these were few and far between.  Like I said before, the problems with this movie I believe was due to the movie being rushed so that it could meet the release date a week prior to the release of ""Superman Returns"" in theaters.All in all, though the movie isn't the greatest, it's not horrible either.  If you're a fan of either of the animated series' featuring Superman, then you should at least give the movie a try, it's at least worth watching once.""Superman:  Braniac Attacks"" is unrated and is suitable for all ages.",3,Two Enemies Unite To Destroy the Man of Steel...,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,3752,"['Approximately', '6', 'years', 'end', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'months', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'wrapped', 'up', 'final', 'season', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'WB', 'felt', 'was', 'time', 'tap', 'Man', 'Steel', 'adventure', 'conveniently', 'time', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'set', 'debut', 'theaters', 'Superman', 'Braniac', 'Attacks', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'voiced', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'angered', 'Superman', 'voiced', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'heroic', 'successes', 'rising', 'popularity', 'masses', 'Metropolis', 'Lex', 'proceeds', 'form', 'dangerous', 'alliance', 'villain', 'known', 'Braniac', 'voiced', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'using', 'advanced', 'weaponry', 'unique', 'strain', 'Kryptonite', 'Lex', 'Braniac', 'new', 'body', 'will', 'allow', 'defeat', 'Man', 'Steel', 'However', 'Lex', 'realize', 'Braniac', ""n't"", 'going', 'just', 'obey', 'Lex', 'orders', 'instead', 'own', 'plans', 'Superman', 'rest', 'world', 'stop', 'two', 'villains', 'Superman', 'must', 'use', 'abilities', 'even', 'brave', 'trip', 'mysterious', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'hope', 'lost.After', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'decided', 'making', 'movie', 'essentially', 'tie-in', 'release', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'epic', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'were', 'faced', 'small', 'quandry', 'Who', 'would', 'voice', 'Last', 'Son', 'Krypton', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'voice', 'Superman', 'was', 'provided', 'actor', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'however', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'character', 'voice', 'was', 'actor', 'George', 'Newbern', 'So', 'actor', 'would', 'bring', 'hero', 'life', 'end', 'choice', 'was', 'made', 'bring', 'back', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'made', 'sense', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'spin-off', 'Superman', 'own', 'animated', 'series', 'rather', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'choice', 'bring', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'back', 'voice', 'Superman', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'one', 'decision', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'recasting', 'voice', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'previously', 'voiced', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'Superman', 'Braniac', 'Attacks', 'chose', 'use', 'actor', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'Sin', 'City', 'Sudden', 'Death', 'Boothe', 'solid', 'actor', 'had', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'voice', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'recognizable', 'Lex', 'choice', 'make', 'switch', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'almost', 'decade', 'same', 'actor', 'voicing', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'question', 'logic', 'here.The', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'only', 'average', 'truthfully', 'expected', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'Again', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'writing', 'animated', 'series', 'was', 'such', 'high', 'quality', 'anything', 'disappointing', 'reason', 'creators', 'animated', 'series', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'way', 'tone', 'completely', 'different', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'be', 'aimed', 'little', 'kids', 'rather', 'kids', 'adults', 'other', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'Really', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'childish', 'stupid', 'little', 'one-liners', 'lame', 'jokes', 'Lex', 'other', 'characters', 'second', 'half', 'really', 'story', 'together', 'feel', 'focused', 'more', 'mature', 'tone', 'animation', 'was', 'solid', 'most', 'part', 'few', 'sequences', 'were', 'weak', 'felt', 'rushed', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'said', 'problems', 'movie', 'believe', 'was', 'due', 'movie', 'being', 'rushed', 'so', 'could', 'meet', 'release', 'date', 'week', 'prior', 'release', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'theaters.All', 'movie', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'not', 'horrible', 'either', ""'re"", 'fan', 'animated', 'series', 'featuring', 'Superman', 'then', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'least', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'Superman', 'Braniac', 'Attacks', 'unrated', 'suitable', 'ages']",N/A

I was so excited to watch it and PU!!!  I also found out about an hour after I watched it that it was coming on Cartoon Network.I hope everyone saw it there for free because this was a waste of money.First off, one star for having Tim Daly and Dana Delaney voice Clark and Lois.  I absolutely love them.  Zero stars for the rest.There are no decent extras on the DVD.  The only extra was a group of trailers for upcoming DVD releases.  One trailer was advertising that Warner was releasing alot of Superman DVDs.  This one was cool because you got glimpses of Superman through the years.  The rest were weak trailers for movies such as a pirate Scooby release.AS TO THE MOVIE:1.  The plot was thin and  weak and full of holes.2.  There was little continuity from Superman:  the Animated Series or the Justice League series.  It appears (I think) that this movie takes place before Justice League.  However, Brainiac appears not to know who Lex is.  Also, Brainiac is excited when he gets access to info about Krypton but he should already have had all of the Krypton info since he was originally from there.  He acted like this was info he never had.  There were also continuity errors in the actual movie.3.  The Phantom Zone scene was short and weak.  The phantom zone should be a dark and dangerous place.  This one was basically the same as a quick ride through a ""scary"" fun house.4.  The actor who voiced Lex (Powers Booth) did a poor job.  Lex is supposed to be highly intelligent as well as ruthless.  This Lex came across as silly.  Not only did the voice not fit the character at all but the dialogue was silly.  Never would I expect Lex to act grateful to Superman for saving him even is he was.  This was just wrong and I cannot say enough who wrong this Lex was.5.  The Mercy (Lex's bodyguard/chauffeur/henchwoman) character was weak.  Also, her hair  color changed from brunette to redhead to blonde throughout the movie.  Guess the creators could not make their minds up.6.  The movie claimed that there would be advancement in the Clark/Lois/Superman romance.  Well, I will not give the end away but I was bitterly disappointed in how this was handled.  In the series, Clark was always sure of himself and always together.  Here he is a wimp.  And more about that-  now I normally love Clark and Lois as a couple BUT  the way she acted in this movie makes me ask WHY???  All she wants is to get into hare-brained trouble so Clark/Superman can waste his life saving her.  Now you can tell that this movie is bad if it makes you root AGAINST Clark and Lois becoming a couple.7.  Superman once again is shown as a wimp.  At one point, you know he can beat Brainiac yet he has to take a huge beating first.  I know they did alot of this on the animated series and Justice League but come on already.  Why make Superman take a 10 minute whooping only to turn around and act as though it never happened and win the fight.Also, this movie is not really kid oriented.  The fight scenes are boring and alot of dialogue is about relationships.  I cannot imagine this holding any child's attention for very long.Well, I could go on but I think you get the drift.

Hanks ""drkainn""","[12, 14]","Superman The Animated Series was a spectacular show that took many ideas from the Superman mythos and added a whole new spin to them.  Paul Dini and Co. put together a terrific show that featured a great cast, fantastic stories with both familiar and new villians, and gave us a series that immediately took a special place in our hearts.  Tim Daily voiced Superman, while known actor Clancy Brown gave us an incredible aristocratic sinister Lex Luthor.  Then, in 1998, Superman TAS came to an end with the epic series finale, ""Legacy.""  Superman would then appear in the Batman Beyond episode, ""The Call,"" which featured a futuristic version of the Justice League, which then lead into Justice League and Justice League Unlimited, which just finished up.  A few months ago, in getting ready for Superman Returns, WB announced they were bringing our animated boy scout back with his first animated direct to video feature.  It was an exciting announcement to hear, but now, after seeing the movie, WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY DOING??!!The plot was terrible, if that is what you could call it.  The music was average, the dialog was attrocious, and my god, the voice acting felt like it came from some 80s anime dub. First off, Luthor is voiced by Powers Boothe instead of Clancy Brown, and boy, how terrible he was. Powers played Gorilla Grodd in Justice League, but for some reason, he sounds more like some low rank amateur in the voice acting department here.  Luthor was already out of character the moment the movie started, but this guy made Luthor sound more like a fool than a villian.  Next up is Brainiac, who also had a new voice actor (Bishop from Aliens), and Lance seemed like he was trying to sound like the Manhunters from JL rather Brainiac, and he was even worse than Luthor in the acting department. In fact, the only characters that didn't seem to have new voices were Superman (Tim Daily is back, but he must have left his skills with Legacy), Lois, Perry, and the Kents. Jimmy sounds similar, but Mercy sounds like some dumb blonde out of California.The movie did have its good points, like the scenes that did not have Luthor or Brainiac in it, of course, that was probably maybe a good 15-20 minutes total, if that.Overall, this movie is just plain out bad.

With the success of JLU and all of the Batman straight to dvd movies my expectations were pretty high.  Needless to say I was a little disapointed.Fist thing and probably the biggest is Powers Boothe voicing Lex Luthor and Lance Henriksen voicing Brainiac.  I'm a die hard Superman/Justice League animated fan and I was extrememly disapointed to find this out.  Powers is just not Lex and it impacted this movie.  Clancy Brown IS Lex Luthor and captured the essence of Lex and I find it hard for anybody to fill in.  On a side note Clancy Brown's version of Mr. Freeze in The Batman series is fantastic.Anyway, Lance Henriksen wasn't a bad Brainiac, but he certainly didn't fit in the role.  His Brainiac didn't affect me as much as the Powers Lex.  Superman's first animated dvd movie (don't count the episode movies) is a let down.  The animation wasn't up to the standards as in Mask of the Phantasm or Sub-Zero which is really too bad for Superman.  I feel he doesn't get the same treatment as Batman.  Animation is supposed to be better than the normal animation found in the complete series.  Even The Batman vs. Dracula had better animation than the series did.  Lets just hope the dvd animated movie of Teen Titans follows this trend.The story wasn't bad, but lacked the strong movie feel as the Batman animated films did.  It felt like 3 episodes taken from the series and slapped together and called ""movie.""  It is Superman so any true fan of Superman will enjoy it.  I love anything Superman and still enjoyed this film.  Looking past the story, animation, and casting choices it was a good start to which I hope is many more Superman strait to dvd movies.

Superman: Brainiac Attacks starts off on the right foot by once again getting Tim Daly to voice the Man of Steel, and Dana Delany reprises the voice of Lois Lane, but the first thing that will give fanboys a groan is seeing that Clancy Brown has been replaced by Powers Boothe as Lex Luthor, and Corey Burton has been replaced by Lance Henriksen as Brainiac.  Now, no offense to Boothe and Henriksen who have always been character favorites no matter what they've done, but they miss the mark as Luthor and Brainiac.  Most of the blame goes to the writing, which features so amazingly atrocious dialogue that you'll think you've been transported back to the era of the Superfriends, but even that show was never this bad.  The tone of the original Superman series was never dark (at least not as dark as the Batman series), but it took itself seriously and provided some great action and had a heart to it; none of which is carried over here.

981238,AHF97M45JFCB,B000F0V0LS,ONENEO,"[0, 1]","Well it was only a matter of time... I'm a self-admitted DCAU (DC Animated Universe) aficionado and while the following property has typically earned nothing but poor reviews from professional critics and casual comic fans alike, I knew that I simply wouldn't be satisfied until adding this to my collection and viewing it for purpose of review.Let's start with the facts.  Released across a single DVD, Superman: Brainiac Attacks is packaged within a single standard sized DVD case and comes in at a runtime of 75 minutes.  There are no extras contained on the set (rare for a DC animated release) but there is a nice assortment of Warner Bros. DVD trailers under the ""Special Features"" heading.The story goes something like this: Super criminal Lex Luthor forms a dangerous alliance with the computer/villain Brainiac once his prototype satellite defense system proves quite unable to destroy the alien upon entry. Using advanced weaponry and a tiny sample of Kryptonite harvested from the far reaches of the galaxy, Luthor redesigns Brainiac after a near-fatal pummeling from Superman to defeat the Man of Steel once and for all.The problem of course is that super-villains rarely learn to play nice together and by the time the union of Brainiac and Luthor crumbles, Superman's got both of them to deal with plus a strain of kryptonite infused nano-virus afflicting both he and Lois.  The only known cure lies deep within the Phantom Zone.The animation, which has been the subject of scrutiny in the past, is certainly on par with the CG-heavy efforts of the later DCAU properties (like Justice League/ JL Unlimited) and is vastly superior visually to the hand-painted efforts of Superman: the Animated Series.  The color pallet is bright and crisp and many of the onscreen effects (fire, explosions, dimensional distortions and so on) are beautifully rendered throughout.About the biggest complaint comes in the form of the voice actor casting as some of the Superman the Animated Series choices were retained (Tim Daly as Superman/ Clark Kent & Dana Delany as Lois Lane) others were replaced seemingly at random.  Among the notables here is digitally effected Lance Henriksen (Bishop from the ALIEN franchise) as Brainiac and Powers Boothe as Lex Luthor (opposed to Corey Burton and Clancy Brown respectively).  In short, Henriksen manages to deliver the goods.  Chalk it up to the natural raspiness of his voice or the cybernetic associations through ALIENS and you end up with a very believable computer-powered organism.  Powers Boothe, however, drops the ball as Luthor.  Sad as it is to say, he displays too much vocal and emotional fluctuation.  Lex is known for his smooth-sounding cunning and there's simply a bit too much inflection here to feel entirely convincing.Aside from the vocal discrepancy (which I'm thoroughly convinced accounts for a majority of fan complaints), the other point of divergence from SM: TAS comes in the form of Duane Capizzi's (known for developing such shows as The Batman and Jackie Chan Adventures) script, which was admittedly developed as a counterpoint to the Superman films (with a slight comedic slant).  As such, the sheer grit that viewers of the original Animated Series have grown to expect is absent and replaced with a livelier, friendlier Metropolis.  However, rumors of the film's departure from the original SM: TAS are highly exaggerated.Perhaps the film's greatest strength, which may simultaneously be its greatest weakness, comes in the form of the pacing.  How can this contradiction possibly make sense?  Well, the weak dialog can hardly be considered feature-length, as a good 30% of the film is completely action-sequence driven.  The battles are truly massive in scale as is their resulting destruction.  The animation in these segments is right up there with what viewers of Justice League have come to expect and unlike SM: TAS, Supes actually uses several of his long overdue abilities (freeze breath, heat and x-ray vision to name a few).  Cooler still is that Brainiac, for as nearly invincible as his body may be, ends up getting the ultimate edge on the Man of Steel by attacking on a nanoscopic level.  Very cool.Interestingly enough, the film is typically not considered a part of the DCAU despite the fact that several of the DCAU's leading figures were heavily involved in its production.  As a result many (mistakenly) believe there must be continuity issues but the show doesn't specifically violate any of the established timelines of the DCAU either.  Capizzi has stated that the biggest difference lies in the fact that the script was developed from the onset to be a standalone plot line and in no way connected to the ongoing threads setup in SM: TAS.In conclusion, it's quite easy to understand how the poor characterization of Lex Luthor has led to many of this film's negative critical responses, I feel like a lot of this stems simply from the fact that the DCAU has raised the bar so high, it's pretty easy to disappoint fans.  Had this come out before SM: TAS or better still, from a completely unrelated firm, I don't think fans would be quite so critical.  There's a lot of entertainment to be found here so long as you go in with expectations a few stages below the DCAU in its prime.",3,Superior to Common Reception,1259366400,"11 28,

I have a bit of venting of my own to add though.I am a huge fan of Bruce Timm's work, and when I sat down to watch my advance copy of this DVD, I just assumed from the animation style that this was another of his works.  After about 10 minutes of listening to the horrible dialogue, I had to look at the cover in order to discover that it was instead the product of the writer of the garbage ""The Batman"" series.Tim Daly's voice being back is the one saving grace of this film.  The animation is good, but nothing better than Superman:TAS when it was on (recent seasons of JLU have refined the animation techniques and been better).  Lance Henrickson and Powers Boothe are good voice actors, but don't fit for Brainiac and Luthor respectively (I kept wondering why Grodd's voice was coming out of Luthor's mouth).These complaints wouldn't be that bad though if it wasn't for the horrible story (using the term ""story"" loosely), and horrendous dialogue.  The story doesn't even fit into the chronology of Superman: TAS - I guess it's supposed to take place in the early days of Superman's career, but it basically disregards previous interactions between the characters.It is obvious that the writer did not ever bother to research the series when writing this garbage, nor did he properly investigate the personalities of the characters.  In this movie, Superman is ambivalent, Luthor is a retard and Brainiac is emotional!!  This entire thing seems like it was written by someone in kindergarten.If you were even a casual fan of Superman: TAS, you will be very disappointed in this mess.  I just regret I will never get back the 75 minutes I wasted watching it.Kudos to Clancy Brown and Corey Burton for staying away from this disaster.",1,Anyone Over Five Years Old Should Beware!,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,1836,"['wo', ""n't"", 'reiterate', 'opinions', 'previous', 'one-star', 'review', 'was', 'dead', 'sense', 'have', 'bit', 'venting', 'own', 'add', 'though.I', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'work', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'advance', 'copy', 'DVD', 'just', 'assumed', 'animation', 'style', 'was', 'works', '10', 'minutes', 'listening', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'had', 'look', 'cover', 'order', 'discover', 'was', 'instead', 'product', 'writer', 'garbage', 'Batman', 'series.Tim', 'Daly', 'voice', 'being', 'back', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'animation', 'good', 'nothing', 'better', 'Superman', 'TAS', 'when', 'was', 'recent', 'seasons', 'JLU', 'have', 'refined', 'animation', 'techniques', 'been', 'better', 'Lance', 'Henrickson', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'are', 'good', 'voice', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Brainiac', 'Luthor', 'respectively', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'Grodd', 'voice', 'was', 'coming', 'Luthor', 'mouth', '.These', 'complaints', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'story', 'using', 'term', 'story', 'loosely', 'horrendous', 'dialogue', 'story', ""n't"", 'even', 'fit', 'chronology', 'Superman', 'TAS', 'guess', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'early', 'days', 'Superman', 'career', 'basically', 'previous', 'interactions', 'characters.It', 'obvious', 'writer', 'did', 'not', 'ever', 'bother', 'research', 'series', 'when', 'writing', 'garbage', 'did', 'properly', 'investigate', 'personalities', 'characters', 'movie', 'Superman', 'ambivalent', 'Luthor', 'retard', 'Brainiac', 'emotional', 'entire', 'thing', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'kindergarten.If', 'were', 'even', 'casual', 'fan', 'Superman', 'TAS', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'mess', 'just', 'regret', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back', '75', 'minutes', 'wasted', 'watching', 'it.Kudos', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Corey', 'Burton', 'staying', 'away', 'disaster']",N/A

981241,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000F0V0LS,P. Hardy,"[4, 8]","Everyone knows that this movie in particular (and volume III of Superman: The Animated Series) was released as a tie in to all the Superman Returns PR going about this June. Granted that the new SM:TAS Direct to Video movie ""Brainiac Attacks"" will not win over avid fans of the original 1990s era series, it has a moments that certainty remind you of the series but this nostalgia is thin and hardly there to boot. I saw this Saturday on POST-TOONAMI and it wasn't bad at first glance to be honest, not as bad as everyone says its on this website. Its pretty clear that ""Brainiac Attacks"" does not follow in the continuity line of the animated series, though Brainiac and Superman are already introduced to each other its seems.The storyline is not the most well thought out thing in the world for starers: The movie starts off with Lex Luthor (acting more or less like the campy Luthor of uber-old SUPERFRIENDS and Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor of the less older SUPERMAN films) complaining about only being able to get a scrap of Kryptonite and being out favored by the people for Man of Steel. Ironically around the same time, a flaming meteor gets past a satellite Luthor built to keep invaders from space from entering Earth's atmosphere, and its passenger proceeds to attack S.T.A.R. Superman comes to the aid of S.T.A.R. labs but is unwittingly outmatched by Brainiac who first distracts him with a missile set to destroy Metropolis then proceeds to pummel him with the Sattillite Luthor built. From there the movie focuses on Lois' feeble attempts to play matchmaker for Jimmy, Clark trying to confess his feelings to an unaware of Lois Lane, and Superman trying to beat a revamped Brainiac. There are some majorly unbelievable things that occur in the movie (usually concerning the way Superman cures Lois of her sickness) that basically brushed my fur the wrong way. But that's bad writing for you. The thing I can say I really liked in the storyline is the use of the Phantom Zone, but that's about it.To be frank the atmosphere of the movie is more or less directed toward a younger audience, thus it would partly explain the loss of comic book-ness from the series. Though this does excuse the lousy writing from non-DC Affiliated writer Duane Capizzi to be honest. While he/she does good with the Clark x Lois relationship, the movie certainly lacks in the TAS seriousness people loved. Simply listening to the dialogue ALONE should tell you that much. The music for the movie was also a major miss. The characterization of Brainiac, Mercy, and Lex Luthor were probably the biggest atmospheric killers in the entire movie; A majority of the other characters were pretty much like their SM:TAS counterparts. The voice acting also hit and miss but this is probably because of the vocal change in the villains. Instead of Clancy Brown as Luthor, the character is instead voiced here by Powers Boothe, who makes a better ""campy/comedic"" villain than a serious one. I.E., he makes a horrible Lex Luthor (where in the world was Brown?). Lance Henriksen takes the place of Corey Burton as the immortal villain Brainiac;For the most part there are some scenes where Henriksen's voice suits the character (""You cannot hide from me,""), but for the rest of the movie you'd wish you could simply mute his voice and watch Brainiac silently crush Superman. Lisa Edelstein is replaced by a woman whom I did not recognize at all as someone with enough talent to voice the usually stoic bodyguard of Lex's. If anything, this Mercy is overly campy as well and not to be taken seriously, like most of the movie. Tim Daly and Dana Danely for the most part are the best voice actors in the movie; There basically isn't much a difference to their performance toward the characters, save for Tim Daly sounds a bit rusty after such a long absence from Superman/Clark Kent. The art is the same as the series with the exception that most of the characters look as though they've spent too much time on the California beach. The action scenes in the film are usually dragged out or just simply used exploit Superman's weakness to energy attacks far too much. However, there are times when the fight scenes between Brainiac and are actually good.So, as a whole ""Brainiac Attacks"" will certainty entertain a younger kid (but not by much) and bring out the ugly side of ""SM:TAS"" fans more than I care to elaborate. Its not totally horrible, it has its moments as I said before, but its probably better of skipped and only watched if your really bored of ""WORLD'S FINEST"" which probably will never come to pass when concerned with this movie. ------ [a 3 out of 5]",3,"Brainiac Attacks has its moments, but can hardly be called ""Super.""",1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,4643,"['Everyone', 'movie', 'particular', 'volume', 'III', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'was', 'released', 'tie', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'PR', 'going', 'June', 'Granted', 'new', 'SM', 'TAS', 'Direct', 'Video', 'movie', 'Brainiac', 'Attacks', 'will', 'not', 'win', 'avid', 'fans', 'original', '1990s', 'era', 'series', 'moments', 'certainty', 'series', 'nostalgia', 'thin', 'hardly', 'boot', 'saw', 'Saturday', 'POST-TOONAMI', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'first', 'glance', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'website', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Brainiac', 'Attacks', 'not', 'follow', 'continuity', 'line', 'animated', 'series', 'Brainiac', 'Superman', 'are', 'already', 'introduced', 'other', 'seems.The', 'storyline', 'not', 'most', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'thing', 'world', 'starers', 'movie', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'acting', 'more', 'less', 'campy', 'Luthor', 'uber-old', 'SUPERFRIENDS', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'less', 'older', 'SUPERMAN', 'films', 'complaining', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'scrap', 'Kryptonite', 'being', 'out', 'favored', 'people', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Ironically', 'same', 'time', 'flaming', 'meteor', 'satellite', 'Luthor', 'built', 'keep', 'invaders', 'space', 'entering', 'Earth', 'atmosphere', 'passenger', 'proceeds', 'attack', 'S.T.A.R', 'Superman', 'aid', 'S.T.A.R', 'labs', 'unwittingly', 'outmatched', 'Brainiac', 'who', 'first', 'missile', 'set', 'destroy', 'Metropolis', 'then', 'pummel', 'Sattillite', 'Luthor', 'built', 'movie', 'Lois', 'feeble', 'attempts', 'play', 'matchmaker', 'Jimmy', 'Clark', 'trying', 'confess', 'feelings', 'unaware', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Superman', 'trying', 'beat', 'revamped', 'Brainiac', 'are', 'majorly', 'unbelievable', 'things', 'occur', 'movie', 'usually', 'concerning', 'way', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'sickness', 'basically', 'brushed', 'fur', 'wrong', 'way', 'bad', 'writing', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'storyline', 'use', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'it.To', 'be', 'frank', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'directed', 'younger', 'audience', 'thus', 'would', 'partly', 'explain', 'loss', 'comic', 'book-ness', 'series', 'excuse', 'lousy', 'writing', 'non-DC', 'Affiliated', 'writer', 'Duane', 'Capizzi', 'be', 'honest', 'he/she', 'good', 'Clark', 'x', 'Lois', 'relationship', 'movie', 'certainly', 'TAS', 'seriousness', 'people', 'loved', 'Simply', 'listening', 'dialogue', 'ALONE', 'should', 'tell', 'that', 'much', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'major', 'miss', 'characterization', 'Brainiac', 'Mercy', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'were', 'probably', 'biggest', 'atmospheric', 'killers', 'entire', 'movie', 'majority', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'SM', 'TAS', 'counterparts', 'voice', 'acting', 'also', 'hit', 'miss', 'probably', 'vocal', 'change', 'villains', 'Instead', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Luthor', 'character', 'instead', 'voiced', 'here', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'who', 'better', 'campy/comedic', 'villain', 'serious', 'one', 'I.E.', 'horrible', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'where', 'world', 'was', 'Brown', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'place', 'Corey', 'Burton', 'immortal', 'villain', 'Brainiac', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'Henriksen', 'voice', 'suits', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'rest', 'movie', ""'d"", 'wish', 'could', 'simply', 'mute', 'voice', 'watch', 'Brainiac', 'silently', 'Superman', 'Lisa', 'Edelstein', 'replaced', 'woman', 'whom', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'someone', 'enough', 'talent', 'voice', 'usually', 'stoic', 'bodyguard', 'Lex', 'anything', 'Mercy', 'overly', 'campy', 'well', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'most', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'Dana', 'Danely', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'best', 'voice', 'actors', 'movie', 'basically', ""n't"", 'much', 'difference', 'performance', 'characters', 'save', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'bit', 'rusty', 'long', 'absence', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'art', 'same', 'series', 'exception', 'most', 'characters', 'look', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'California', 'beach', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'usually', 'dragged', 'out', 'just', 'simply', 'used', 'exploit', 'Superman', 'weakness', 'energy', 'attacks', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'However', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Brainiac', 'are', 'actually', 'good.So', 'whole', 'Brainiac', 'Attacks', 'will', 'certainty', 'entertain', 'younger', 'kid', 'not', 'much', 'bring', 'out', 'ugly', 'side', 'SM', 'TAS', 'fans', 'more', 'care', 'elaborate', 'not', 'totally', 'horrible', 'moments', 'said', 'probably', 'better', 'skipped', 'only', 'watched', 'really', 'bored', 'WORLD', 'FINEST', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'come', 'pass', 'when', 'concerned', 'movie', '[', '3', '5', ']']",N/A

Finally, this great version of Superman was getting his own animated movie!Or so we thought.As more details poured in, fans got more and more skeptical. Fan-favorite villains Lex Luthor and Braniac (Clancy Brown and Corey Burton) were recast. It was to be written by Dwayne Capizzi, of The Batman, an almost universally reviled anime-inspired version of the Dark Knight. What little pleasure that show ever had for me was in its kinetic animation, the writing was always atrocious and simplistic.This is ten times worse. How this man can type out some of the lines in this movie is amazing. Lines like Lex Luthor saying ""I'm happy! Oh, wait, no...I'm saaaaad!"" or even telling Superman as he battles Brainiac ""I'm rooting for you, my man!"" is incredible. It's ten times more kiddie and stupid than any awful episode of The Batman.The animation is rubbery and, for the most part, poor. Characters rarely look the same way in different scenes.This DVD has been cropped to Fullscreen for some inexplicable reason since it was made in widescreen for a direct-to-video release.I wont spoil details of the story for those who care, but suffice it to say that it makes the infamous movie ""Batman and Robin"" look absolutely brilliant.All in all, this is not a movie, but a corporate product, perhaps an ad for the upcoming ""Superman Returns"" movie.

981249,A3HP9JNRHOA5CW,B000F0V0LS,William James Taylor IV,"[2, 2]","Apparently set outside the DCAU, we find Superman/Clark Kent contemplating revealing himself to Lois Lane, the woman he loves, but things are thrown off when Brainiac and Lex Luthor get involved, resulting in alien sicknesses, a quest for the cure in the Phantom Zone, and a big fight between Superman and a giant Brainiac robot.Sound compelling? Well, I'm afraid it isn't. Poor dialogue and childish storytelling make this an embarrassment to the characters and fans everywhere. I guess this is what happens when Bruce Timm and Paul Dini aren't in charge. Lance Henriksen subs for Corey Burton as Brainiac, and he throws out a decent voice for it, but he also sounds out of place, while Powers Boothe subs for Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor and sadly he does a horrible job with it, playing Luthor more like a campy 60s Batman villain than the charming scheming brute Brown made him (Boothe also voiced, more effectively, Gorilla Grodd on Justice League). Tim Daly comes back as the voice of Superman (having had missed out on Justice League due to the short lived Fugitive remake, requiring George Newbern to replace him) and he still throws out a good Superman voice, but everything around, except for Dana Delany as Lois Lane, is very poor. Still, the fight between Superman and the giant Kong sized Brainiac was fun to watch, moreso than anything in Bryan Singer's bloated ""Superman Returns"".It's too bad they didn't use this as a chance to bridge the gap between the criminally underrated ""Superman: The Animated Series"" and ""Justice League: TAS"", tying off the storyline started in LEGACY, showing Superman regaining the trust of the Eath.",2,What a shame,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,1642,"['Apparently', 'set', 'outside', 'DCAU', 'find', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'contemplating', 'revealing', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'woman', 'things', 'are', 'thrown', 'off', 'when', 'Brainiac', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'get', 'involved', 'resulting', 'alien', 'sicknesses', 'quest', 'cure', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'big', 'fight', 'Superman', 'giant', 'Brainiac', 'robot.Sound', 'compelling', 'Well', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""n't"", 'Poor', 'dialogue', 'childish', 'storytelling', 'make', 'embarrassment', 'characters', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'guess', 'what', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'Paul', 'Dini', 'are', ""n't"", 'charge', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'subs', 'Corey', 'Burton', 'Brainiac', 'out', 'decent', 'voice', 'also', 'place', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'subs', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'sadly', 'horrible', 'job', 'playing', 'Luthor', 'more', 'campy', '60s', 'Batman', 'villain', 'charming', 'scheming', 'brute', 'Brown', 'made', 'Boothe', 'also', 'voiced', 'more', 'effectively', 'Gorilla', 'Grodd', 'Justice', 'League', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'back', 'voice', 'Superman', 'having', 'had', 'missed', 'out', 'Justice', 'League', 'due', 'short', 'lived', 'Fugitive', 'remake', 'requiring', 'George', 'Newbern', 'replace', 'still', 'out', 'good', 'Superman', 'voice', 'everything', 'around', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'very', 'poor', 'Still', 'fight', 'Superman', 'giant', 'Kong', 'sized', 'Brainiac', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'moreso', 'anything', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'bloated', 'Superman', 'Returns', '.It', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'chance', 'bridge', 'gap', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Justice', 'League', 'TAS', 'tying', 'off', 'storyline', 'started', 'LEGACY', 'showing', 'Superman', 'regaining', 'trust', 'Eath']",N/A
