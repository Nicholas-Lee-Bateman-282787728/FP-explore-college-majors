1691392,A2DI9XP5ITS3P,B00HQI811Y,"Allegrobas ""Allegrobas""","[1, 2]","I did not read the novel on which this TV-movie is based, but I can say that the movie is a great achievement irrespective of how well it followed the book (which is a separate matter). Both Ellen Burstyn and Heather Graham did a great job in playing their roles---Ellen as the sadistic, punitive, and domineering grandmother and Heather as the secretive, superficial, delusional, borderline-like mother of the four children in the attic. The kids' acting was passable and average, but it is their condition and suffering that adds a painful theme to this movie. In spite of their having such a demented mother they all appear to be quite normal, so their extreme conditions in the attic makes the viewers feel empathy for them and revulsion at what they have to endure; then too we feel anger at their mother for being part of such dastardly plan to &#34;become rich.&#34;  One interesting part of the film is that the plot and the kids' suffering are so disturbing that we viewers hang on for some explanation as to why it is so necessary for them to suffer so much indignity if the main goal is just to inherit some money. Is there a hidden agenda by the mother who on the surface expresses so much love for them? Why is the grandmother so sadistic towards the mother and the kids? Or is the kids' suffering simply an unfortunate consequence of having a grandmother and a mother with personality disorders?  The ending of the story is not quite satisfactory to me, but, then again, what other ending could this story possibly have?  Very well made movie.

1691394,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,B00HQI811Y,brainout,"[1, 1]","This Lifetime version has a sequel, Petals on the Wind, which perhaps explains why its ending differs from what other reviewers were expecting.Two basic ideas, incest and resultant cruelty as a pattern in the family, pervade.  Very difficult to watch, with Petals on the Wind being somehat lighter and more hackneyed, but a completion which alike begs for a third followup.You can know the plot and still find the portrayals creepy.  So here's an important spoiler: it's not clear from the Lifetime movie why the children are 'abominations' or 'devil spawn'.  Answer, since the movie won't say, and you'll find it impossible to follow, if you don't know: they are children of incest themselves.  Ancient Egyptian and other culture's practice of deeming such unions 'holy', is thus invoked.  Movie basically explores the notion of incest producing mental illness.Some reviewers complained about the sudden ability to leave the attic, as if that were a mistake in the story.  In fact, the obviousness of it makes their staying afterwards, demonstrate their psychological dependence, and lets the audience know that the father must have died; so their continuing to stay, means either the mother or the grandmother, secretly wants to allow them to escape; knowing that if they do, they will not alert the police.  Very clever direction, to keep all that silent, allowing the audience to figure it out merely by the sudden access, which was preceded by the last appearance by the grandfather, and their mother's allowing them to 'hide' in the bar, at their first 'Christmas' since incarceration in the attic.  So it seems like the mother loves them after all.. until they observe her kissing a man they learn is her new fiance.So who's the enemy?  Grandmother, or mother?  So they don't leave when they get access outside, not wanting to leave mother behind.  So then more drastic measures must be employed, to get rid of them...Finally, many have complained about Heather Graham's performance, but I found it convincing; a woman who snaps but is shallow at the same time, would act as she did.  Ms. Burstyn was consummate as the cruel grandmother with an undertone of empathy for the children.  She gave such a reality to the conflicted character that I often had to turn away from the screen when watching.",3,Creepy and intense,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,2304,"['Lifetime', 'version', 'sequel', 'Petals', 'Wind', 'perhaps', 'why', 'ending', 'differs', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'expecting.Two', 'basic', 'ideas', 'incest', 'resultant', 'cruelty', 'pattern', 'family', 'pervade', 'Very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Petals', 'Wind', 'being', 'somehat', 'lighter', 'more', 'hackneyed', 'completion', 'alike', 'begs', 'third', 'followup.You', 'can', 'know', 'plot', 'still', 'find', 'portrayals', 'creepy', 'So', 'here', 'important', 'spoiler', 'not', 'clear', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'why', 'children', 'are', ""'abominations"", ""'devil"", 'spawn', 'Answer', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', ""'ll"", 'find', 'impossible', 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'children', 'incest', 'Ancient', 'Egyptian', 'other', 'culture', 'practice', 'deeming', 'such', 'unions', 'thus', 'invoked', 'Movie', 'basically', 'notion', 'incest', 'producing', 'mental', 'illness.Some', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'sudden', 'ability', 'leave', 'attic', 'were', 'mistake', 'story', 'fact', 'obviousness', 'staying', 'afterwards', 'demonstrate', 'psychological', 'dependence', 'audience', 'know', 'father', 'must', 'have', 'died', 'continuing', 'stay', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'secretly', 'allow', 'escape', 'knowing', 'do', 'will', 'not', 'alert', 'police', 'Very', 'clever', 'direction', 'keep', 'silent', 'allowing', 'audience', 'figure', 'out', 'merely', 'sudden', 'access', 'was', 'preceded', 'last', 'appearance', 'grandfather', 'mother', 'allowing', ""'hide"", 'bar', 'first', 'incarceration', 'attic', 'mother', 'all..', 'observe', 'kissing', 'man', 'learn', 'new', 'fiance.So', 'who', 'enemy', 'Grandmother', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'when', 'get', 'access', 'not', 'wanting', 'leave', 'mother', 'So', 'then', 'more', 'drastic', 'measures', 'must', 'be', 'employed', 'get', 'rid', 'Finally', 'many', 'have', 'complained', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'performance', 'found', 'convincing', 'woman', 'who', 'shallow', 'same', 'time', 'would', 'act', 'did', 'Ms.', 'Burstyn', 'was', 'consummate', 'cruel', 'grandmother', 'undertone', 'empathy', 'children', 'gave', 'reality', 'conflicted', 'character', 'often', 'had', 'turn', 'away', 'screen', 'when', 'watching']",Flowers In The Attic

But the movie was so devoid of suspense, fear and a sense of time. The movie plods along like the bullet points one would find in cliff notes. No real explanations for the character's feelings or actions. The big &#34;incest&#34; moment that is meant to shock and be revealing of the character's repressed sexuality and emotions, is so abrupt and dull.  A good adaptation of the movie really requires a sense of dread to build and give us a feel that they have been in the attic for years. The original movie created the dread and Louise Fletcher's grandmother was much more scary than Ellen Burstyn's (they made her too nice). I think my own grandmother was more crazy than she was. Yet, I did like the performances overall. Heather Graham's performance as the mother was actually pretty good, despite what I had heard. Although when she tries to play angry and mean, she fails. A very good movie could have been made with these pieces, but just an ok movie was created. What I was hoping would be the adaptation everyone was waiting for left me still waiting.

Andrews infamous Best-Seller &#34;Flowers In The Attic.&#34; But for years I've heard it was a &#34;dirty&#34; book because there is incest in the plot. Now, Lifetime TV unveiled a highly publicized TV movie that is faithful to the book. Well, nothing sells books and movies like controversy, so I decided to tune in and see what all the fuss was about. After watching this movie, nothing could induce me to read the book. But I will say that Lifetime Network and &#34;Attic&#34; are a perfect match.Lifetime Network specializes in lurid, usually sexually driven, tales featuring psychotic women and/or abuse victims.&#34;Attic&#34; features two psychotic women and four abuse victims. There is the mother Corrine (Heather Graham) who has her kids locked up in a room upstairs until she can get herself back into Daddy's will.Corrine was disinherited, you see, because she married her father's half-brother (her own Uncle). The children, Christopher, Cathy, and two younger twins, are left to the mercy of their sadistic Grandmother, who brings them daily food and dishes out punishments. The children are told they will be locked up for a few days. This turns into imprisonment that lasts two years.  The children receive  daily food baskets, an old-fashioned TV to watch, no school at all, and excessive  punishments from Grandmother. Corrine has no intention of letting the children out. She's having a high time living the good life without them. Is it any wonder, really, that Cathy and Christopher (Kiernan Shipka and Mason Dye) drift into an incestuous relationship as an emotional escape from prolonged abuse from Corrine and Grandmother?Everyone is so freaked out by the Cathy-Christopher incest that nobody mentions the fact that Grandmother has a whip and she LOVES to use it, or that Corrine tries to kill her children with poisoned dougnuts!! One of the younger twins does die, which doesn't bother Corrine for an instant. At least Ellen Burstyn effectively chews the scenery as Psycho Grandmother (&#34;Your very conception is an ABOMINATION of God!). As emotionally manipulative Psycho Corrine, Heather Graham barely registers any emotion whatsoever.Mason Dye is especially nice, handsome and guilty &#34;eye candy&#34;  for the audience. Somehow, Dye and Shipka manage to keep their heads above the increasingly disturbing mess of &#34;child abuse as a form of entertainment.&#34; &#34;Attic&#34; is like a car wreck you can't bear to witness, but you don't dare look away, either. Watching the movie, you never wonder why Lifetime made it (Lifetime thrives on this stuff), but you do wonder what the hell was going on in V.C. Andrews' twisted mind when she wrote the original book! &#34;Attic&#34; is the worst kind of pulp fiction; deliberately designed to shock and disturb. When the viewer realizes how easily Psycho Grandmother is defeated, &#34;Attic&#34; comes into sharper focus as even more cruel, cold and manipulative. &#34;Attic&#34; spawned sequel books and, with sensational ratings, it's no surprise that Lifetime will produce sequel films. It's no surprise that, with Lifetime and &#34;Attic&#34;, you get exactly what you expected; and you feel a bit sick and dirty after you watch it.",3,"YOU GET WHAT YOU EXPECT IN LIFETIME'S DIRTY ""ATTIC"":",1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,3236,"['never', 'read', 'V.C', 'Andrews', 'infamous', 'Best-Seller', '34', 'Flowers', 'Attic.', '34', 'years', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'was', '34', 'dirty', '34', 'book', 'incest', 'plot', 'Now', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'unveiled', 'highly', 'publicized', 'TV', 'movie', 'faithful', 'book', 'Well', 'nothing', 'books', 'movies', 'controversy', 'decided', 'tune', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'watching', 'movie', 'nothing', 'could', 'induce', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'say', 'Lifetime', 'Network', '34', 'Attic', '34', 'are', 'perfect', 'match.Lifetime', 'Network', 'lurid', 'usually', 'sexually', 'driven', 'tales', 'featuring', 'psychotic', 'women', 'and/or', 'victims.', '34', 'Attic', '34', 'features', 'two', 'psychotic', 'women', 'four', 'abuse', 'victims', 'mother', 'Corrine', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'who', 'kids', 'locked', 'up', 'room', 'upstairs', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'Daddy', 'will.Corrine', 'was', 'disinherited', 'see', 'married', 'father', 'half-brother', 'own', 'Uncle', 'children', 'Christopher', 'Cathy', 'two', 'younger', 'twins', 'are', 'left', 'mercy', 'sadistic', 'Grandmother', 'who', 'daily', 'food', 'out', 'punishments', 'children', 'are', 'told', 'will', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'few', 'days', 'imprisonment', 'two', 'years', 'children', 'receive', 'daily', 'food', 'baskets', 'old-fashioned', 'TV', 'watch', 'school', 'excessive', 'punishments', 'Grandmother', 'Corrine', 'intention', 'letting', 'children', 'out', 'having', 'high', 'time', 'living', 'good', 'life', 'wonder', 'really', 'Cathy', 'Christopher', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'Mason', 'Dye', 'drift', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'emotional', 'escape', 'prolonged', 'abuse', 'Corrine', 'Grandmother', 'Everyone', 'so', 'freaked', 'out', 'Cathy-Christopher', 'incest', 'nobody', 'fact', 'Grandmother', 'whip', 'LOVES', 'use', 'Corrine', 'kill', 'children', 'poisoned', 'dougnuts', 'One', 'younger', 'twins', 'die', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Corrine', 'instant', 'least', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'effectively', 'scenery', 'Psycho', 'Grandmother', '34', 'very', 'conception', 'ABOMINATION', 'God', 'emotionally', 'manipulative', 'Psycho', 'Corrine', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'barely', 'emotion', 'whatsoever.Mason', 'Dye', 'especially', 'nice', 'handsome', 'guilty', '34', 'eye', 'candy', '34', 'audience', 'Somehow', 'Dye', 'Shipka', 'manage', 'keep', 'heads', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'mess', '34', 'child', 'abuse', 'form', 'entertainment.', '34', '34', 'Attic', '34', 'car', 'wreck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'witness', 'do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'look', 'away', 'either', 'Watching', 'movie', 'never', 'wonder', 'why', 'Lifetime', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'stuff', 'do', 'wonder', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'going', 'V.C', 'Andrews', 'twisted', 'mind', 'when', 'wrote', 'original', 'book', '34', 'Attic', '34', 'worst', 'kind', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'deliberately', 'designed', 'shock', 'disturb', 'When', 'viewer', 'how', 'easily', 'Psycho', 'Grandmother', 'defeated', '34', 'Attic', '34', 'sharper', 'focus', 'even', 'more', 'cruel', 'cold', 'manipulative', '34', 'Attic', '34', 'spawned', 'sequel', 'books', 'sensational', 'ratings', 'surprise', 'Lifetime', 'will', 'produce', 'sequel', 'films', 'surprise', 'Lifetime', '34', 'Attic', '34', 'get', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'feel', 'bit', 'sick', 'dirty', 'watch']",Flowers In The Attic

No, Heather Graham would not have been my first choice to play the Dollanger kid's mother.  She portrayed a difficult character who is difficult for many to believe could exist anyway.  So I will give her light applause for braving the challenge.  That is not to say she did great, but, her best in a very tough role.  Ellen Burstyn plays the grandmother who is also a challenging role.  She did wonderful, I couldn't agree more.  I do think the role was a bit tamer than I remember in the book.  And here we arrive at the heart of the matter.  I think the complaints that I have seen, people are blaming on the actors.  At least a bit of that blame should be the directors responsibility, if not all.  I think the challenge of bringing this film to screen (big or small one) is first of all so many love these series of books and read them with their own ideas about the characters.  I loved Mason Dye as Christopher.  But again, he seemed tamer than I recall so I'd wager the director and writer had more to do with the disappointment of fans than they've been given credit.  True, not all the cast was the best for the roles.  Let's not forget this is made for TV and with a limited budget.

With that said I still liked it as I did the first but this is the more faithful adaptation. When I first saw the advertisements on Lifetime about this [will explain why I was watching that in a minute] I was excited. I had to tell my lady as she loves the book and even the first flick. I had been over at my grandparent&#8217;s house visiting them when I saw this on their screen. Lifetime has had some good flicks from time to time so I thought this would be one.The story follows a family just like any one else, parents and children living a happy life. That is until the father dies and leaves the mother with all the kids and all the bills. She can&#8217;t afford them on her own so she does what she never thought she would do, go home. It turns out that she is from a wealthy family but left home for the man she loved and married. Once there her evil mother allows her and her children in but they have to stay locked in a room upstairs. Their mother promises that she will fix everything, but can she?This is a more faithful adaptation of the book but there are things changed for the screen. But was left intact was the incest that made the book so infamous. With that said while more faithful it isn&#8217;t a perfect film. I have read others say they didn&#8217;t like the acting but I thought it was good here, especially Ellen Burstyn as the grandmother. She did an excellent job here was wonderfully evil but I thought Heather Graham was just as good. She did a great job because I believed her in the role. The kids were good as well and each did their job. The film was written by Kayla Alpert who is also the writer of the upcoming sequel.

Lol...  With that said, the acting in this was so, just, BLAH - Kiernan Shipka seemed to be rehashing her Mad Men character, and was unbelievable as a blonde.  I'm sure they could have found ONE really blonde young actress who could have played the role.  She also had literally zero chemistry with the boy who played her brother - who was almost as blah as Kiernan.  They almost completely ignored Cathy's obsession with ballet - which was mentioned and alluded to, but not really clear.  Heather Graham seemed to have lost her acting ability for the entire film, and while Ellen Burstyn is a great actress, she was nowhere near as terrifying as Louise Fletcher in the 80's version.  And this is the real problem - the cast, story, and vibe of the 80's version was so much better - more suspenseful, believable, and terrifying - even WITHOUT the incest.  And unless Lifetime plans to make films of the entire series, the 80's version ended the film better as well.  In the 80's version, I think we all GOT why the kids didn't just kick grandma's rear end and walk out - but here?  There seemed to be little reason to remain prisoners.  Readers of the series know where this story eventually goes, but I kind of suspect Lifetime isn't planning this to be a series, so they should have allowed the same closure we saw in the 80's film.  As it is, there was virtually no real closure.Overall, a big disappointment.  I waited 20 years for a good film adaptation of this book, and I guess I'll have to keep waiting.

The book took place over a period of three years, and a lot happened in those three years.  It also dealt with very touchy subject matter that would not be easy to include in any film or TV show.  In the book, you could get inside Cathy's head and reach an understanding of why things were happening the way that they did.  Because that didn't happen in the movie, it was almost impossible to understand what motivated the relationship between Chris and Cathy to become so unhealthy and ultimately disturbing.  In the movie the way the characters reacted about the change in their relationship failed to show just how conflicted and confused Cathy was, as well as how and why she blamed her mother and grandmother for Chris' actions toward her.  And yet, at least this version did not pretend there was no incest in the book at all, as the first movie apparently did.I was more upset about the almost total lack of focus on Cathy's dancing, something that was so intrinsically her that to leave it out, or barely touch on it, was almost sacrilegious.  Also glossed over was the jealousy that Corrine had clearly felt toward Cathy, both regarding her first husband (Cathy's father) and her second.As for the casting and the acting, everyone seemed to do an adequate job with the material they were given.  The stand-out was, of course, &#34;The Grandmother&#34;.  Ellen Burstyn did an amazing job as the grandmother.  She made it all worth watching.  Heather Graham, however, phoned-in her performance.

1691413,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00HQI811Y,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 18]","The 1979 cult novel ""Flowers in the Attic"" by V.C. Andrews is one of those rare books that really tapped a nerve with the reading public.  This genuine cult classic scandalized America, sold over 40 million copies worldwide, and spawned no less than four sequels.  The book is alternately reviled and beloved, but it surely has to be one of the most talked about novels of its day.  Once read, it is not a story soon to be forgotten.  Many fans of the book were not exactly captivated by the 1987 film adaptation which took large liberties with the source material.  Therefore, ""Flowers in the Attic"" always seemed like an ideal tale to be reimagined for a new generation.  While I applaud the fact that the Lifetime network has attempted a more faithful interpretation, the shocking nature of Andrews' story is probably not best served as a television movie.  Be that as it may, ""Flowers in the Attic"" is not without merit.  Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn (who, truthfully, I would watch in anything) sinks her teeth into the role of the chilly and scary grandmother Olivia.  In contrast to her vivid performance, everything else feels a little bit more bland than you might anticipate.The movie begins setting up a perfect American family as only a TV movie can.  This blissful happiness, however, last only a few minutes before daddy dies leaving the rest of the clan to fend for themselves.  Widowed Corrine (Heather Graham) whisks the children off to her parent's estate.  The kids (led by Mad Men's Kiernan Shipka as narrator Cathy and Mason Dye as perpetually optimistic Christopher) didn't even know they had Grandparents!  Well, it turns out that there is much they don't know about their mother and their family history.  Graham is an heiress who disappointed her father and must now wriggle her way back into his good graces in order to secure an inheritance.  There's one catch, though, the children's existence must remain a secret.  Burstyn steps into the picture as Graham's mother and the children are secreted into an unused room with a connection to the attic.  This is just a starting point to a sordid tale that I won't spoil for those new to ""Flowers in the Attic.""  Let's just say that this brief deception is not short lived and the longer the kids stay hidden, the closer they come to the truth about their mother and her family.The story behind the film (which is more faithful to the novel than the previous film) is both harrowing and shocking.  It should play almost like a Gothic horror story.  But for whatever reason, this version definitely lacks a suspense factor.  When Burstyn is on the scene, she is wickedly compelling.  But none of the other characters register nearly as vividly.  Graham is appropriately vacant and Dye and Shipka are likable enough, but the movie doesn't have the time (or doesn't take the time) to take advantage of the real horrors unfolding.  As the days and months start passing by, I never became more involved or emotionally invested.  In the end, this version of ""Flowers in the Attic"" has both some decent moments and a few logic defying sequences.

1691415,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B00HQI811Y,LadyLestat,"[0, 0]","There were some good and bad things about this movie. However, the bad does outweigh the good, in my opinion.The good things:This movie was more true to the book than the first movie. The cutting of Cathy's hair at the hands of Chris, as well as the hanging of their mother in the wedding dress being left out because it was never a part of the ending in the book.This movie was more controversial than the first movie because they were bold enough to tackle the subject that was taboo in the first film.Heather Graham made a good ""mother.""Ellen Burstyn made a good ""grandmother."" I just wish she would have done more.The bad things:All of the children were horribly miscast, and all were equally terrible actors.The ""grandmother"" was way too soft. Louise Fletcher was scary, mean, heartless, and she absolutely killed her performance.This movie was so rushed that we were deprived of the small details that made the first film so creepy. We barely got to know anything about the twins and how close they were. We didn't get to see the little things like the gravedigger digging the graves, or the mother poisoning the cookies, or in this case, doughnuts.The incest was apart of the book, and I applaud the fact that they weren't afraid to go there, but those scenes before and after were still cringe-worthy. They seemed proud of what they had done.It seemed crazy to me to watch those kids come in and out of that room like it had a revolving door, while at they same time we are supposed to believe they were still helpless to leave when the older kids were still coming and going as they felt like it.Cathy sneaking around and kissing her mother's boyfriend on the lips was stupid.These kids were not actually locked inside the attic like the first movie.I hated the ending because there was no justice for the Dollanganger children, and yes I have read the book, but I still didn't like that. Sometimes trying to make a movie too much like the book doesn't work, and in this case, it didn't. Their mother literally got away with murder.That being said, I already acknowledged that this movie was like the book. Now, whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, depends on who you ask. I know that the mother was absolutely not hanged by her own wedding dress in the book, but that provided a type of closure that I liked to the first movie being that there were no sequels made. That part being left out of this movie, for me, only made the ending seem unfinished. It left something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the things that I found stupid about the book are the exact same things that I found stupid about the movie. You are welcomed to disagree all you like, but like I said, it was stupid. Cathy sneaking around kissing her mother's boyfriend, the key to the door, none of those scenes were in the first movie which made it more believable. Seriously...you and your siblings are being beaten and held captive, and all you can think about is what it's like to kiss a man on the mouth, so you do it...un-freaking-believable!On top of that, I have a hard time believing that anyone is being held against their will when they have made a key to the damn door and they are going back and forth as they please. That's even more unbelievable now in 2014. In other words, despite what was in the first movie or the book, their captivity (if it could be considered that since they had a key) shouldn't have taken years, I don't give a flip about the mental as well as physical boundaries that kept them there, one of the twins died for no reason, and they could have left anytime they felt like it. Their mother actually let them out for the party, so it was clear she made no effort to conceal her true nature. Why would she let them out at her own engagement party so they could spy from an enclosed case inside the bar if they weren't even supposed to exist much less be seen? WTF! All of that was absurd!It was just an okay Lifetime made for T.V. movie.

1691418,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00HQI811Y,Matthew Scott Baker,"[0, 0]","Back in the late 80s, when I was in junior high, several of the girls in my class started reading FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC by V.C. Andrews.  I knew nothing about the book and honestly thought nothing of it at the time, having developed a healthy appetite for horror in the forms of Clive Barker, Stephen King, Dean Koontz and many others.  But when the teachers at our school forbid the girls to carry the book around with them, I became intrigued.  What was all the fuss?  Curious, I checked the book out from the city library and gave it a shot.  WOW.  Not what I was expecting at all, but very good nonetheless!  One might even say it has tinges of horror in it, which is partly why I liked it so much.  The underlying tones in the book have haunted me to this very day.When I learned Lifetime was making a movie version, I jumped at the chance to watch it.  After all, the book was (and still is) deemed controversial because of some of its subject matter, so who wouldn&#8217;t want to see a televised version of something like that?  Although the movie is toned down quite a bit from the book, this is a still a very faithful adaptation to the source material and one heck of a film.There was another movie adaptation of this book that debuted in 1987, however it (in my opinion) is not nearly as good as this 2014 version.  It was well made for the most part, but it did not capture the dark tone of the book.  You can&#8217;t have a decent movie adaptation of a book unless you can actually bring the depths of the book to the screen.FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC is shot well and seems to have a pretty modest budget.  I particularly like the house they chose as the location; it fits what I saw in my head almost perfectly.  The acting, likewise, is solid.  I will admit I am surprised with the choice of Heather Graham as the children&#8217;s mother, however she does a good job with the role.  Ellen Burstyn, however, steals the show as the overbearing, self-righteous grandmother.  Her cold demeanor and rough exterior should be enough to garner an Oscar nod, in my opinion.The actors who tackle the roles of the children do a superb job as well.  Kiernan Shipka is ideal as the film&#8217;s narrator, Cathy, and she plays off of co-star Mason Dye like a pro.  Dye, respectively, handles his man-of-the-house persona with ease.  Ava Telek and Maxwell Kovach are adorable as the twins, and I hope to see more of both onscreen.The story follows the book very well, however Lifetime barely touches some of the more controversial aspects of the book.  I will not go into detail because you must read the book AND see this film, and I don&#8217;t want to ruin either.  But I do understand this is a made-for-TV movie, so taboo topics cannot always be fleshed out.FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC is a definite win for me and fans of thrillers and mysteries should have a blast with this film.

1691419,A370Z6I5GBWU44,B00HQI811Y,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[0, 0]","This story started off really well, and is in many parts more faithful to the book than the first Flowers movie. Ellen Burstyn did a great job as Olivia, and at first I was thrilled with this movie.I would expect that some things be cut out of the book to fit the movie's time limit, but I was angry that important plot points were changed. In the book, when Olivia puts tar in Cathy's hair, Chris uses his chemistry kit to remove the tar. In the movie Cathy's hair gets cut. What was even the point of including this scene if you were just going to change it? Better to leave it out!!!Some people didn't like Heather Graham's portrayal of Corrine. Personally I was cool with it. Olivia in this movie is a bit kinder/gentler than the book, which I was okay with. What I was NOT ok with was that Malcolm Foxworth - the reason the family is so screwed up - was not a villain at all in this movie. In the book, even though the children never meet him face to face, Chris and Cathy glimpse him at the Christmas party (after being hidden by their mother who used to hide in the same spot) Malcolm looks up and smiles evilly, showing that he knows of their existence. In the movie, Chris and Cathy hide, and Grandmother is aware of them, but not Grandfather.Since the movie failed to convey Malcolm's evil at all, the story lost some of its punch because Malcolm is a huge catalyst in the Foxworth saga. If the movie had illustrated how evil Malcolm could be, then Burstyn's portrayal of Olivia would have been balanced out, but without Malcolm's influence, there isn't much reason for Olivia to be gentler than she was in the book.The ending?

I think Kiernan Shipka was wrong for the part of Cathy. She wasn't engaging. I didn't find myself rooting for her.  There was so little interaction between her and her mother, which was something pretty important in the book - as she grew up the mother got increasingly threatened by her beauty and her relationship with the twins and Christopher.This movie rushed through (admittedly many) plot points and it was hard to tell what anyone's motivation was.  Why did the mom leave them up there so long? Yes she was enjoying her time as a free, single, wealthy woman, but it was never totally clear why she left them and (spoiler alert) tried to kill them.  Why was the grandmother so alternatingly mean and also sympathetic?  I think Ellyn Burstyn oversold the sympathetic parts.  Definitely chewed the scenery.Heather Graham definitely looked more like the mother I pictured in the book but she was so clearly phoning it in.

Personally, I like both for their own merits, and the contrasts are numerous, though some rather subtle. Louise Fletcher and Ellen Burstyn put their own spin on their portrayal of the Bible thumping tyrant of the grandmother. Both child casts do a nice job, but Heather Graham as the mother is very hard to like or even care about, the original's wasn't much better. I was most impressed with Ellen's grandmother being subtly more vulnerable, esp.when she saw the kids stand up to her and their mother, that was very impressive to me, underneath that fanatic exterior, she definitely had a weakness or two. I also liked how the teenage siblings saw through their mother's deception a lot faster.Louise Fletcher was menacing yes, but she showed almost no emotion at all, I know most villians have little to no conscience, but Louise seemed so inhumane, I wasn't buying it, to me it was way too over the top.

This version of the movie, released in 2014 is more true to the book, which I liked. The movie was about a family, whose father died and left them with no money. The mother decided to go home and make amends with her angry father, in order to inherit his fortune. She and the grandmother hid her children, Cathy, Carrie, Corey and Chris in the attic, making sure the grandfather did not know of their existence. There was a lot of drama and suspense, which I loved. I could not wait for this movie to come to television and it did not disappoint. I loved it, so much in fact, I purchased the movie, as soon as it became available. The characters of Chris and Cathy made the movie come to life for me.  The young actors were passionate, wonderful and very talented.

1691432,A6UPVE0AG8HIH,B00HQI811Y,Tina,"[7, 9]","This adaptation is much more faithful to the book than the original version, which is comically awful.The good:- Ellen Burstyn gives a great deal of complexity to a woman who is really the definition of evil and callous at first.  But she does soften at a certain point, and it never feels forced or out of character.- The actors playing the kids are great, but Mason Dye (Christopher) is the one who really shines.  He just seemed to &#34;get it.&#34;  Christopher maintains his faith in their mother, even after months of being trapped in the attic - something that I could never empathize with.  However, when his faith in her is finally destroyed, he acts.  He is the one who turns the desire to escape into an actual plan.  He's smart, the rock of their little family, so he's aware of his responsibility.  In the book I found him to be incredibly pompous and arrogant, but Mason Dye makes him sympathetic and really shows you a boy who had to grow up too quickly for the wrong reasons.  He is a man-child in every heartbreaking sense of the term.  I have nothing but good things to say about Mason Dye.  He's definitely gifted.- Faithfulness to the book means the incest storyline is included.  Why is this a good thing?  Well in the book (spoiler alert), it's not exactly consensual sex.  Christopher essentially forces himself on Cathy, and then its this weird added dynamic to the story that complicates the fact that you are rooting for them.  Apparently in the sequel, it gets even more convoluted.  The point here is to illustrate the isolation of these kids from the world.  All they have is each other.  Thankfully, in the film, the sex is consensual, but it's still weird, as it should be.- In the original adaptation, there was no sign of the physical impact their entrapment would have on their bodies.  They were like supermodels and they stayed that way, which made no sense to me whatsoever.  In this version, their skin becomes pale, bags appear under their eyes, they are lethargic, etc.  These things are small, but they are definitely there.  The details are much appreciated by this viewer.The bad:- Oh Heather Graham.  What am I gonna do with you?  Her performance is painful.  There is absolutely no life to it.  Yes the mother is vacant, and ditzy.  But she's also manipulative, selfish, and cruel.  It's literally there in the script.  In the hands of a different actress, it would have been a showstopper.  The role had so much potential.  But she just didn't seem to get to that level.  She is simply delivering words on a page, and when surrounded by better talent, it makes her seem even more lifeless.- The faithfulness to the book is a double edged sword.  Yes, it's better, but that also means some things are rushed, or mentioned for no reason (the ballet thing is really REALLY unnecessary), and the whole is somewhat clunky.Over all I really enjoyed it.  It's well made, and any adaptation that is faithful to its source material should be commended.",4,I actually really liked it,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,2989,"['adaptation', 'much', 'more', 'faithful', 'book', 'original', 'version', 'comically', 'awful.The', 'good', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'great', 'deal', 'complexity', 'woman', 'who', 'really', 'definition', 'evil', 'callous', 'first', 'soften', 'certain', 'point', 'never', 'forced', 'character.-', 'actors', 'playing', 'kids', 'are', 'great', 'Mason', 'Dye', 'Christopher', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'shines', 'just', 'seemed', '34', 'get', 'it.', '34', 'Christopher', 'faith', 'mother', 'even', 'months', 'being', 'trapped', 'attic', 'something', 'could', 'never', 'empathize', 'However', 'when', 'faith', 'finally', 'destroyed', 'one', 'who', 'desire', 'escape', 'actual', 'plan', 'smart', 'rock', 'little', 'family', 'aware', 'responsibility', 'book', 'found', 'be', 'incredibly', 'pompous', 'arrogant', 'Mason', 'Dye', 'sympathetic', 'really', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'too', 'quickly', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'man-child', 'heartbreaking', 'sense', 'term', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'Mason', 'Dye', 'definitely', 'gifted.-', 'Faithfulness', 'book', 'incest', 'storyline', 'included', 'Why', 'good', 'thing', 'Well', 'book', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'not', 'exactly', 'consensual', 'sex', 'Christopher', 'essentially', 'Cathy', 'then', 'weird', 'added', 'dynamic', 'story', 'fact', 'are', 'rooting', 'Apparently', 'sequel', 'even', 'more', 'convoluted', 'point', 'here', 'illustrate', 'isolation', 'kids', 'world', 'have', 'other', 'Thankfully', 'film', 'sex', 'consensual', 'still', 'weird', 'should', 'be.-', 'original', 'adaptation', 'was', 'sign', 'physical', 'impact', 'entrapment', 'would', 'have', 'bodies', 'were', 'like', 'supermodels', 'stayed', 'way', 'made', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'version', 'skin', 'becomes', 'pale', 'bags', 'appear', 'eyes', 'are', 'lethargic', 'etc', 'things', 'are', 'small', 'are', 'definitely', 'there', 'details', 'are', 'much', 'appreciated', 'viewer.The', 'bad', 'Oh', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'What', 'am', 'gon', 'do', 'performance', 'painful', 'absolutely', 'life', 'mother', 'vacant', 'ditzy', 'also', 'manipulative', 'selfish', 'cruel', 'literally', 'there', 'script', 'hands', 'different', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'showstopper', 'role', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'level', 'simply', 'delivering', 'words', 'page', 'when', 'surrounded', 'better', 'talent', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'lifeless.-', 'faithfulness', 'book', 'double', 'edged', 'sword', 'Yes', 'better', 'also', 'things', 'are', 'rushed', 'mentioned', 'reason', 'ballet', 'thing', 'really', 'REALLY', 'unnecessary', 'whole', 'somewhat', 'clunky.Over', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'well', 'made', 'adaptation', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'should', 'be', 'commended']",Flowers In The Attic

1691435,A6AT9WIGOXKRP,B00HQI811Y,"Whipple McTeelson the Third ""Purveryor of Mad...","[0, 1]","Why they bothered making this movie as poorly and horribly wretchedly rote as this will forever daunt even my most shallow of thoughts.  I gave it's predecessor a 1 star in pure  adulation and adoring love.  For this movie it gets 1 star also.  Not the same one star.  Not by a long shot.  This is a 1 star filled with shame and sad sad disappointment.This once was a story that captivated over eager teen age girls with overwrought emotions.  Back before the days when a novel for young ladies must take place in the not so distant apocalypse as some fickle heroine becomes her people's messiah as she's busy pining away her heart over 2 smoldering whimpering pouting boys  we had the Dollanganger Series.  Just reading the very real and the very intense tale of these little heroines and heroes locked away in their crazed grandmother's attic felt like the apocalypse itself.  There was no need for a pretense of over drawn end times and over hyped fairy tale fantasy worlds of distopia and dysentery.  No indeed.  VC Andrews was able to wrap the readers around her fingers as she so naturally and purely built a twisting story of suspense.But you wouldn't know it from this drivel of a movie.  All drama has been sucked dry.  The pacing is terrible, the acting horrible and the plot itself stripped free of tension or necessity of act.  If you want to watch how not to make a movie and how to bore the audience you could do far worse than this one.  But I wouldnt advise it.  Don't give these 'filmmakers' the satisfaction I say.  Go watch the 1987 classic.  Otherwise you may as well just read the synopsis of all 5 books off WIkipedia if you have no self-respect.",1,A pale imitation of a pale photocopy of a bleached out mere recollection of what once was a masterful story.,1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,1668,"['Why', 'bothered', 'making', 'movie', 'poorly', 'horribly', 'wretchedly', 'rote', 'will', 'forever', 'daunt', 'even', 'most', 'shallow', 'thoughts', 'gave', 'predecessor', '1', 'star', 'pure', 'adulation', 'adoring', 'love', 'movie', '1', 'star', 'also', 'Not', 'same', 'one', 'star', 'Not', 'long', 'shot', '1', 'star', 'filled', 'shame', 'sad', 'sad', 'disappointment.This', 'once', 'was', 'story', 'captivated', 'eager', 'teen', 'age', 'girls', 'overwrought', 'emotions', 'Back', 'days', 'when', 'novel', 'young', 'ladies', 'must', 'take', 'place', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'apocalypse', 'fickle', 'heroine', 'people', 'messiah', 'busy', 'pining', 'away', 'heart', '2', 'smoldering', 'whimpering', 'pouting', 'had', 'Dollanganger', 'Series', 'Just', 'reading', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'intense', 'tale', 'little', 'heroines', 'heroes', 'locked', 'away', 'crazed', 'grandmother', 'attic', 'felt', 'apocalypse', 'was', 'need', 'pretense', 'drawn', 'end', 'times', 'hyped', 'fairy', 'tale', 'fantasy', 'worlds', 'distopia', 'dysentery', 'indeed', 'VC', 'Andrews', 'was', 'able', 'wrap', 'readers', 'fingers', 'so', 'naturally', 'purely', 'built', 'twisting', 'story', 'suspense.But', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'drivel', 'movie', 'drama', 'been', 'sucked', 'dry', 'pacing', 'terrible', 'acting', 'horrible', 'plot', 'stripped', 'free', 'tension', 'necessity', 'act', 'want', 'watch', 'how', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'how', 'bore', 'audience', 'could', 'do', 'far', 'worse', 'one', 'wouldnt', 'advise', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', ""'filmmakers"", 'satisfaction', 'say', 'Go', 'watch', '1987', 'classic', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'read', 'synopsis', '5', 'books', 'WIkipedia', 'have', 'self-respect']",Flowers In The Attic

By far, this version is much better. Though, it was only a 2 hour movie, the writers had to rush it along, I thought it followed the book more closley than the theatrical version. Everything wasn't in the movie as in the book, if one hadn't read the book but saw the this movie first, they wouldn't have missed anything. But, if they read the book afterwards, they might have been a little disapointed. The only other thing I find fault with is the actress who played Cathy, Kiernan Shipka, though a wonderful and beautiful actress, she was not what I had in mind for Cathy. But all-in-all, I recommend watching it.",4,Just short of 5 stars...,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,733,"['Hi', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Flowers', 'Attic', '20', 'times', 'saw', 'first', 'movie', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'far', 'version', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'only', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'writers', 'had', 'rush', 'thought', 'followed', 'book', 'more', 'closley', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Everything', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'book', 'one', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'missed', 'anything', 'read', 'book', 'afterwards', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'disapointed', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'find', 'fault', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Cathy', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'wonderful', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'mind', 'Cathy', 'all-in-all', 'recommend', 'watching']",Flowers In The Attic
