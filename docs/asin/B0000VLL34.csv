However, there is a basic art of movie making that transcends budgets. This movie completely lacks that art, unfortunately. When we watch a movie, we should feel completely absorbed and forget that we're watching a movie, we shouldn't be, as this movie does, constantly reminded of the existence of a very jittery person shooting the film on an ultra low budget (think walmart)-level camcorder. Sorry, but this is just so poorly done that its not even remotely enjoyable to watch.",1,"the positive reviews must be plants, no one has standards that low",1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,579,"['Low', 'budget', 'disqualifier', 'Many', 'favorite', 'films', 'are', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'ones', 'However', 'basic', 'art', 'movie', 'making', 'budgets', 'movie', 'completely', 'art', 'unfortunately', 'When', 'watch', 'movie', 'should', 'feel', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'existence', 'very', 'jittery', 'person', 'shooting', 'film', 'ultra', 'low', 'budget', 'think', 'walmart', '-level', 'camcorder', 'Sorry', 'just', 'so', 'poorly', 'done', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",N/A

At first I was a little annoyed with the Proffesor in the film but mid way through I realized that he is just a rambling idiot who is so into himself that he does not see the big picture.  The big picture is the very entertaining film behind the film Strawberry Estates.  I consider Estates not a Blair Witch Rip off because this film is more believable. The footage has video drop out. Sound problems and everything that a real documentary would have if it was never put together and edited profesionally. There is no gore, nudity but the end will sure spook you out.  Make sure you watch it will no lights on and at night.  Also watch it with someone who does not talk through movies.  I personally hate those Yappy Yappy types.  The movie will start out slow.  It builds itself into one heck of a spook show.  Very well put together.  The bonus stuff &quot;ROCKS&quot; there are hidden features.  A few short films.  The behind the story on Strawberry Estates is the best.  It is a film about the first verson of Strawbery Estates with Debbie Rochon and Tina Krause.  Ron Bonk put together a very entertaining film.  I like it better than Vicious Sweet.",5,Very interesting take on the Genre.,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,1244,"['watching', 'film', 'started', 'notice', 'getting', 'more', 'involved', 'story', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'annoyed', 'Proffesor', 'film', 'mid', 'way', 'realized', 'just', 'rambling', 'idiot', 'who', 'so', 'not', 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'big', 'picture', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'film', 'Strawberry', 'Estates', 'consider', 'Estates', 'not', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Rip', 'off', 'film', 'more', 'believable', 'footage', 'video', 'drop', 'out', 'Sound', 'problems', 'everything', 'real', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'was', 'never', 'put', 'together', 'edited', 'profesionally', 'gore', 'nudity', 'end', 'will', 'sure', 'spook', 'out', 'Make', 'sure', 'watch', 'will', 'no', 'lights', 'night', 'Also', 'watch', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'talk', 'movies', 'personally', 'hate', 'Yappy', 'Yappy', 'types', 'movie', 'will', 'start', 'out', 'slow', 'one', 'heck', 'spook', 'show', 'Very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'quot', 'ROCKS', 'quot', 'are', 'hidden', 'features', 'few', 'short', 'films', 'story', 'Strawberry', 'Estates', 'best', 'film', 'first', 'verson', 'Strawbery', 'Estates', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'Tina', 'Krause', 'Ron', 'Bonk', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'like', 'better', 'Vicious', 'Sweet']",N/A

The professor, when he was in the obsessed ""mad scientest"" mode, was just plain hokey. The most believable of all the characters was the cameraman, Jason. Not a bad entry into the entire ""found footage"" genre, but it is definitely low-ranking. HOWEVER... The extras were interesting.
