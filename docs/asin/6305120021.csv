TRUCKS is another variation on Stephen King's classic short story of the same name. Of course, comparisons between this film and the 80s, King-directed mess, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE are inevitable. While OVERDRIVE went full-throttle into cheeeze-town, TRUCKS attempts to be more of a straight-forward horror movie. Does it succeed? Sort of. The driver-less vehicles themselves are fairly menacing. The human characters are divided into the typical categories of resourceful heroes or hillbilly truck fodder. My favorite scene is when the mailman is pulverized by the toy, RC dump-truck!

449191,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,6305120021,David Girod,"[0, 0]","For those of you who were disappointed in the Stephen King directed &#34;Maximum Overdrive&#34;, here is a second attempt at King's &#34;Night Shift&#34; short story &#34;Trucks&#34;.While the storyline is similar to the short story, I was kind of surprised at just how little &#34;Trucks&#34; the movie took from &#34;Trucks&#34; the short story? I'm sure almost every decision made was due to budget...or complete lack of budget. But I really expected this film to hone close to the written story for some reason.As the movie opens we see a truck come alive in a desert junkyard and kill it's owner. The truck then moves to the edge of the highway and parks. Down the road we meet a small group of people at a diner/campground/truck stop facility. We learn that the area is close to Area 51, and the campground specializes in hikes to purported alien encounter sites. We also meet our heroes and heroine...to be honest they are pretty forgettable, and I can't remember a single character name.  We see that a couple more trucks spring to life, and kill their owners, one carrying toxic chemicals explodes creating a toxic cloud and cutting the diner/truck stop off from help. Before long the 4 living trucks have surrounded the truck stop and are holding the people inside hostage.Talk about a shoe-string budget, in total I think there are 6 trucks that come alive here...well 7 if you count the Tonka Toy Truck that a mailman encounters (not kidding...and it's the best scene in the film). After watching &#34;Maximum Overdrive&#34; and seeing everything from push mowers to electric knives come alive...a couple of trucks seems pretty tame. There is no sense of danger or tension to the film, and the acting is pretty lousy. Not in a so-bad-it's-good way, just in a boring...how much longer?...kind of way.

Most of the action centers around a remote truck stop near Area 51.  At the stop you can fuel your vehicle, have a bit at the diner, rent a cabin or sign up for a backpacking tour.  But the locals and some guests are in for a major change when something happens to the local truck population.  The trucks begin to move on their own and they seem to be moving with a purpose.  And that purpose is not especially fond of humans.Soon the truck oasis becomes a prison as the humans are trapped by marauding trucks.  A truck-engineered chemical spill prevents help from the outside.  It is up to the handful of survivors to find a way to continue to survive.  the trucks may have some use for humans but they don't need many.  Will anyone manage to get away and back to truck-free civilization?  You will have to watch and see.In Maximum Overdrive Stephen King spent his directing time by directing the trucks and not the actors and the film suffered for it.  This time we have better direction of the cast and the setting has been improved (in my opinion).  The story holds together well and there are moments of real tension.  The threat of the trucks is well displayed and the tension feels real.  My only real problem with this version is in one scene where a vehicle goes by with the driver clearly visible and then the camera changes to show the empty driver's seat.

A shoddy made-for-TV remake of 1987's self-proclaimed moron movie MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE (which was adapted, written and directed believe it or not by Stephen King), TRUCKS falls short of anything period. And no THIS IS NOT EVEN remotely based on the Stephen King short story, I have read it. The short story was way better than this, well I can't even write it out respect to Amazon and folks on here.The movie lacks a useable plot and meanders to a very stupid ending with a talking helicopter. I thought this was about murderous machines not the freakin' TRANSFORMERS. I never get to see this infamous Toy truck scene with the mailman though I hear it's hilarous, I think it's gets edited by SciFi or I'm too bored to look at the screen the last two times it aired.And that was Timothy Busfield in the film? I could have sworn it was John Ritter. Yup it was, I had to check IMDB for that, it's hard to tell them apart in my mind. At best avoid this movie at all cost! Put on a radiation suit to dump it in the trash if it shows up at your door, then contact HAZMAT to haul it away to safe location in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

Palkowski ""marskee""","[7, 8]","This movie is an updating of 1986's ""Maximum Overdrive"", which was based on the short story that this is based on, with the story's title being the name of this movie. Timothy Busfield (the only big name in this one) stars as Ray, a man who has moved to the near-Area 51-town of Lunar. He and his son, Logan (Brendan Fletcher) are trying to make a new life for themselves. However, that will have to be put on hold for the time being, as driverless trucks are attacking the truck stop he works at. Because of the trucks, many people are stranded there, including a former hippie, a newlywed couple, a military man and his daughter, and two truckers. They must band together to survive, and find out the cause of this threat.Based upon the Stephen King story from his ""Night Shift"" collection, the movie is, agreeably, not bad for a made-for-TV movie, as it is quite chilling in a few scenes (The Tonka truck attacking an innocent mailman, and the spill generator in a control truck inflating a radiation suit which then grabs an axe and takes care of the drivers). Tim Busfield is good as the hero, and the supporting actors, being first time actors, get a passing grade from me. It is rumored that this was given a PG-13 upon video release, and then got more gore to bump it up to an R, and regrettably, that cut is not included. The movie is presented in widescreen, despite being a TV movie. Little grain is shown, and the print is quite clean. The extras fall flat, however, just being trailers for ""Soemtimes They Come Back...Again"", ""The Tommyknockers"", and the movie itself. Trimark does make some good DVD releases,.

449219,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6305120021,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Trucks (Chris Thomson, 1997)There is a school of thought, and one to which I subscribe completely, that states that if you're going to remake a movie, remake a bad movie. After all, there are any number of flicks out there with great ideas and terrible execution. Why bother remaking good-to-great movies when there's so much grist to work with that's justifiably obscure? However, the folks who decided to have another go at Stephen King's short story ""Trucks,"" the basis for the execrable eighties horror flick Maximum Overdrive, neglected one small part of the philosophy-- that one should try to make a movie that was better than the original piece of crap. I mean, come on-- the tagline for the movie is ""U-Turn, U-Die!"". You know you're not going to be seeing a Welles film here.The paper-thin plot revolves around trucks that start driving themselves and trap a small group of humans in a truck stop. Well, that's the original story, anyway. King is one of the masters of taking a paper-thin plot and turning it into a creepily effective story, but Brian Taggert (also responsible for such immortal fare as Poltergeist III and the 1991 TV remake of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?) figured that wasn't enough for a feature-length made-for-TV movie. And, you know, maybe he's right; after all, Maximum Overdrive was far more faithful to the story and still came out smelling like horse manure. So he added some backstories, a couple of romantic subplots, that sort of thing. All of which would have been well and good if any of them had actually gone anywhere.Surprisingly, the acting here is not bad. The cast is headed by TV stalwart Timothy Busfield (The West Wing) and B-movie queen Brenda Bakke (Groom Lake), both of whom do about as well as possible with the material given them. (Bakke really does have acting chops to go with her considerable beauty, but for some reason she always seems to come up with terrible roles.) The rest of the cast is similarly pedigreed, and do about as well with the material (a young Brendan Fletcher is particularly notable playing Busfield's son). I wish I could tell you that the acting is a good enough reason to see this, but it really isn't. The movie is really, really badly-written, with subplots set up and then abandoned, characters completely changing (in one memorable case, a particular character, played by Sharon Baker, goes through what seems like three or four complete emotional makeovers in the space of roughly ten minutes; well, I guess it looks good on one's resume), and a deus ex machina ending that raises more questions than it answers. I thought the whole idea of deus ex machina was to tie everything up neatly.

Both are based on a Stephen King novella and in fact, the 1986 ""Max"" was written, produced and directed by Stephen King himself. He called it a ""moron"" movie and I guess I will have to take his word for it, although I'm not sure if he was talking about the movie going audience or himself.  The movie was highly ridiculed but is actually highway miles above the remake. And the pace and ""roadkills"" of the original sped along while the pace for ""Trucks"" is comparable to an arthritic senior citizen on a walker.  And worst of all there are no characters in this movie you even care about so who can care about their fates?  The sole reason for my overly generous 2 star rating? The mailman versus the toy truck.

It's a straight to video flick I don't want you guys to accidentally pick up on a boring night.The story is about trucks that, for whatever reason, come to life and trap a bunch of rural folks in a diner.

Yeah, I know it's straight to video (...).  I think I lost some IQ points when the chemical spill truck turned on its generator for the spill suits, pumped it full of air and had the disembodied suit then axe - AXE - the driver of said vehicle.It's not even one of those movies that you watch to see how bad it's going to get (like ""Leprechaun in the Hood"").
