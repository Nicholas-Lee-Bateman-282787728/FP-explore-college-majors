684202,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00005UF86,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Interesting even if you're not a Catholic, or even a Christian. The art treasures, the attention to detail in ritual and mundane work alike, and a pretty rare look inside a place that is off limits to most people most of the time.The Swiss Guard are examined in detail through preparations for a swearing in ceremony. The whole process of beatification through the lives of five prospective saints, especially the first one from Puerto Rico, a study of the life of the pope. Did you know, for example, that the Sisters of the Poor (the ones founded by Mother Theresa of India) run a soup kitchen inside the Vatican? Or that the Pope has his own personal photographer, who apparently serves for the life of the pope at least, if not his own life. That there is a program underway to digitally record and restore old documents in the Vatican archives, including a letter written in Leonardo DaVinci's own hand? It seems that iron in the ink he used has eaten away the parchment or paper (don't remember which; think it was paper). There are three major art restoration laboratories: stone, tapestries, and paintings. As a needlework enthusiast myself, I stopped breathing as I watched a nun meticulously cut away a few threads on a tapestry which were a previous and not very skilled restoration.These people think not in years or decades, but centuries.We got to watch the Vatican Choir practice and then perform. Boys enter at the age of nine, and leave when they turn 13 ""or their voice breaks, whichever comes first."" Discreetly, no mention was made about the castrati of previous centuries.But some negative things were included, especially an explanation of how the Holy Roman Empire became so terribly corrupt, with popes who made land grants to their bastard sons. The one that commissioned a particularly fine basilica pawned the priceless tapestries to pay the builders. The trial of Galileo is mentioned, and the Inquisition -- very briefly.2001 was in the reign of John Paul II, the Polish pope. He looked so bent and feeble in these pictures that after the film was over I looked him up in Wikipedia. He lived until 2005, so I guess he wasn't quite as bad off as he seemed.It's interesting history and culture, and Catholics will probably find it priceless.",3,Some Very Rare Access to the Inside of a Very Closed Enclave,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,2268,"['Interesting', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'Catholic', 'even', 'Christian', 'art', 'attention', 'detail', 'ritual', 'mundane', 'work', 'alike', 'pretty', 'rare', 'look', 'place', 'limits', 'most', 'people', 'most', 'time.The', 'Swiss', 'Guard', 'are', 'examined', 'detail', 'preparations', 'swearing', 'ceremony', 'whole', 'process', 'beatification', 'lives', 'five', 'prospective', 'saints', 'especially', 'first', 'one', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'study', 'life', 'pope', 'Did', 'know', 'example', 'Sisters', 'Poor', 'ones', 'founded', 'Mother', 'Theresa', 'India', 'run', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'Vatican', 'Pope', 'own', 'personal', 'photographer', 'who', 'apparently', 'life', 'pope', 'least', 'not', 'own', 'life', 'program', 'underway', 'digitally', 'record', 'restore', 'old', 'documents', 'Vatican', 'archives', 'including', 'letter', 'written', 'Leonardo', 'DaVinci', 'own', 'hand', 'iron', 'ink', 'used', 'eaten', 'away', 'parchment', 'paper', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'think', 'was', 'paper', 'are', 'three', 'major', 'art', 'restoration', 'laboratories', 'stone', 'tapestries', 'paintings', 'needlework', 'enthusiast', 'stopped', 'breathing', 'watched', 'nun', 'meticulously', 'cut', 'away', 'few', 'threads', 'tapestry', 'were', 'previous', 'not', 'very', 'skilled', 'restoration.These', 'people', 'think', 'not', 'years', 'decades', 'got', 'watch', 'Vatican', 'Choir', 'practice', 'then', 'perform', 'Boys', 'enter', 'age', 'nine', 'leave', 'when', 'turn', '13', 'voice', 'breaks', 'first', 'Discreetly', 'mention', 'was', 'made', 'castrati', 'previous', 'centuries.But', 'negative', 'things', 'were', 'included', 'especially', 'explanation', 'how', 'Holy', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'became', 'so', 'terribly', 'corrupt', 'popes', 'who', 'made', 'land', 'grants', 'bastard', 'sons', 'one', 'commissioned', 'particularly', 'fine', 'basilica', 'pawned', 'priceless', 'tapestries', 'pay', 'builders', 'trial', 'Galileo', 'mentioned', 'Inquisition', 'very', 'briefly.2001', 'was', 'reign', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'Polish', 'pope', 'looked', 'so', 'bent', 'feeble', 'pictures', 'film', 'was', 'looked', 'up', 'Wikipedia', 'lived', '2005', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bad', 'interesting', 'history', 'culture', 'Catholics', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'priceless']",N/A

Told in a very organised manner looking at typical major events in the lives of a number of people, the director uses these to inform and educate the audience just what goes on at as well as the history of the capitol of the Catholic Church.  Even the blemishes are not covered up as there is a very frank discussion about the sale of indulgences which was a major factor behind the Reformation movement, about bad popes, about the wrongful treatment of Galileo etc.  Narrator Martin Sheen does a great job as well as he describes what goes on in the build up to a Beautification, an appointment of an archbishop, an appointment of a Swiss Guard, the life of the official photographer, the council which decides on sainthood etc.In addition to very good content I was very impressed with the picture quality which is first class as well as the sound quality which comes in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound which is very rare for documentaries.  This definitely enhanced my enjoyment of this dvd.

The film shows us the printing service, post office, art restoration lab and choirs of the world's smallest state. You will also learn about site's history, starting as Saint Peter's tomb and growing to a small ""trophy,"" and to two successively larger basilicas. The section on the search for Saint Peter's tomb is especially well done, with computer graphics used to explain the location of a 1st-century necropolis beneath the basilica's massive dome. The Swiss Guard is depicted through the eyes of the young men who swear to defend the Pope with their lives. It is also depicted via the tailor who must design each of their 100+ piece uniforms. You will meet Arturo Marti, the Vatican photographer, view some of his quietly-touching photographs and accompany him to a papal audience with visiting dignitaries. You will meet the Franciscan nun who has devoted decades of her life to hand-restoring some of the Vatican's priceless artworks. You will encounter the Sampietrini workers, who labor unsung to clean the floors and haul the massive draperies used during beatification and canonization ceremonies. And you will glimpse the Holy Father himself as he ordains another crop of bishops who follow in the footsteps of the Apostles to do Christ's work on earth.""Inside the Vatican"" is a loving look at part of the Church's material edifice. The film does not sugarcoat the real-life historical excess of those who walked its marbled corridors. Crusades, Inquisitions and venality -- all parts of the human experience -- have colored the history of the place. Yet one would have to be a rabidly anti-Catholic polemicist (or just plain stone-hearted) not to admire the craft, effort, love and piety that also went into shaping these hallowed palaces.""Inside the Vatican"" is a wonderful choice for Catholic Sunday school teachers who wish to impart a bit of the positive side of the institutional Church to their students.",5,The living marble heart of a thriving institution,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,2040,"['Martin', 'Sheen', 'skillfully', 'colorful', 'wonderfully-shot', 'depiction', 'inner', 'workings', 'Vatican', 'film', 'printing', 'service', 'post', 'office', 'art', 'restoration', 'lab', 'choirs', 'world', 'smallest', 'state', 'will', 'also', 'learn', 'site', 'history', 'starting', 'Saint', 'Peter', 'tomb', 'growing', 'small', 'trophy', 'two', 'successively', 'larger', 'basilicas', 'section', 'search', 'Saint', 'Peter', 'tomb', 'especially', 'well', 'done', 'computer', 'graphics', 'used', 'explain', 'location', '1st-century', 'necropolis', 'basilica', 'massive', 'dome', 'Swiss', 'Guard', 'depicted', 'eyes', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'swear', 'defend', 'Pope', 'lives', 'also', 'depicted', 'tailor', 'who', 'must', 'design', '100+', 'piece', 'uniforms', 'will', 'meet', 'Arturo', 'Marti', 'Vatican', 'photographer', 'view', 'quietly-touching', 'photographs', 'accompany', 'papal', 'audience', 'visiting', 'dignitaries', 'will', 'meet', 'Franciscan', 'nun', 'who', 'devoted', 'decades', 'life', 'hand-restoring', 'Vatican', 'priceless', 'artworks', 'will', 'encounter', 'Sampietrini', 'workers', 'who', 'labor', 'unsung', 'clean', 'floors', 'haul', 'massive', 'draperies', 'used', 'beatification', 'canonization', 'ceremonies', 'will', 'glimpse', 'Holy', 'Father', 'crop', 'bishops', 'who', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Apostles', 'do', 'Christ', 'work', 'earth', 'Vatican', 'loving', 'look', 'part', 'Church', 'material', 'edifice', 'film', 'not', 'sugarcoat', 'real-life', 'historical', 'excess', 'who', 'walked', 'marbled', 'corridors', 'Crusades', 'Inquisitions', 'venality', 'parts', 'human', 'experience', 'have', 'colored', 'history', 'place', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'rabidly', 'anti-Catholic', 'polemicist', 'just', 'plain', 'stone-hearted', 'not', 'admire', 'craft', 'effort', 'love', 'piety', 'also', 'went', 'shaping', 'hallowed', 'palaces', 'Vatican', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'Catholic', 'Sunday', 'school', 'teachers', 'who', 'wish', 'impart', 'bit', 'positive', 'side', 'institutional', 'Church', 'students']",N/A
