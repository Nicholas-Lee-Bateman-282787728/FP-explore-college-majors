1198531,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001GQ3ED2,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 13]","This is a tough review to write. I need to say up front that I respect our men and women in the military who fight for freedom across the globe. These brave souls deserve our all, and seeing the final resting places of those who didn't make it is humbling in the extreme.But if we're going to be honest about reviewing this documentary, then we have to do it objectively (i.e., without emotions, and an eye toward education and informing the general public).My first big problem is that there's very little information given on SECTION 60; about it's formation, the battle for more space for grave sites, who oversees the care of the grounds, and how the families of the deceased view these aspects. Instead, the camera is relegated to basically being a fly on the wall while families visit the cemetery. We see families cry, touch headstones, leave trinkets for their dearly departed, and listen to them mourn. And that is the entirety of the film. It is also focused almost entirely on those soldiers killed in the current Middle East conflicts, with nothing noted about the surrounding soldiers who've been there since Vietnam, Korea and beyond.Another big problem is that there were too many lingering shots of headstones. Headstones being cleaned. Headstones with the sun setting behind them. Headstones with jelly beans on them. This might not have been too bad if the documentarians had included informational dialogue during a few of them. But the shots are eerily silent, making it seem more macabre than packing any sort of emotional punch. Too, I found these overly-long shots (sorry to say) exceptionally boring.Let's not forget that these brave men and women died so that we might live, too. Life is for the living, not the dead. And it is the living and how they deal with what's left to them that I would've found more fascinating than this current documentary.",2,Not At All What I Was Expecting ...Or Wanted,1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,1876,"['tough', 'review', 'write', 'need', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'respect', 'men', 'women', 'military', 'who', 'fight', 'freedom', 'globe', 'brave', 'souls', 'deserve', 'seeing', 'final', 'resting', 'places', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'humbling', 'extreme.But', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'honest', 'reviewing', 'documentary', 'then', 'have', 'do', 'objectively', 'i.e.', 'emotions', 'eye', 'education', 'informing', 'general', 'public', '.My', 'first', 'big', 'problem', 'very', 'little', 'information', 'given', 'SECTION', '60', 'formation', 'battle', 'more', 'space', 'grave', 'sites', 'who', 'care', 'grounds', 'how', 'families', 'deceased', 'view', 'aspects', 'Instead', 'camera', 'relegated', 'basically', 'being', 'fly', 'wall', 'families', 'visit', 'cemetery', 'see', 'families', 'cry', 'touch', 'headstones', 'leave', 'trinkets', 'dearly', 'departed', 'listen', 'mourn', 'entirety', 'film', 'also', 'focused', 'almost', 'entirely', 'soldiers', 'killed', 'current', 'Middle', 'East', 'conflicts', 'nothing', 'noted', 'surrounding', 'soldiers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Vietnam', 'Korea', 'beyond.Another', 'big', 'problem', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'lingering', 'shots', 'headstones', 'Headstones', 'being', 'cleaned', 'Headstones', 'sun', 'setting', 'Headstones', 'jelly', 'beans', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'bad', 'documentarians', 'had', 'included', 'informational', 'dialogue', 'few', 'shots', 'are', 'eerily', 'silent', 'making', 'seem', 'more', 'macabre', 'packing', 'sort', 'emotional', 'punch', 'Too', 'found', 'overly-long', 'shots', 'sorry', 'say', 'exceptionally', 'boring.Let', 'not', 'forget', 'brave', 'men', 'women', 'died', 'so', 'might', 'live', 'too', 'Life', 'living', 'not', 'dead', 'living', 'how', 'deal', 'what', 'left', 'would', ""'ve"", 'found', 'more', 'fascinating', 'current', 'documentary']",Section 60: Arlington National Cemetery

And you dare not. That's the burden the mantle of leadership places upon you. You could be the person who gives the orders that will bring about the deaths of thousands and thousands of young men and women. It is an awesome responsibility. You cannot fail. You dare not fail...""My three stars were after my first review of this DVD.  By the second review I felt better about this documentary, however, I can not change the star-ratings anymore.I was stationed at Fort Myer, outside of Arlington National Cemetery, in the summer of 1995.  I would proudly watch as many burials as I could, as the Old Guard stationed there does a touching job for each veteran burried there.  (In fact, I would highly recommend every American watch a military funeral when visiting Arlington National Cemetery).  There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes of a military burial that I wish the documentarians had shown (and that includes more than just digging the graves).  This is why I originally gave this DVD only three stars although a solid four stars is more appropriate.The DVD's background noises at first bothered me; you can hear jets taking off in the background and hear the traffic off the George Washington Parkway.  Sometimes the wind blew.However, one can not argue that this DVD needed to be made.  When servicemembers die or get seriously wounded the country does not just lose a warrior, it gains entire families and friends who grieve over the loss of their loved one.  This DVD shows how young mothers, wives, young children, and most touching, former comrades-in-arms mourning at the tombstones of the deceased.I am an Iraqi War veteran myself.  I was there during the height of the insurgency in 2006-2007.  The daily casualty toll at times was demoralizing.  I've seen young soldiers come back from patrol, I've talked to young enlisted folk who witness the deaths of ther comrades-in-arms.  I've seen their tired and grieving faces.  Watching this DVD brought back those moments of intense pain and sadness in me, another reason why I couldn't give this DVD five stars like everyone else has.  It took me a long time to get back to normal after returning from Iraq; sleeping through the night was especially difficult the first year.Kudos to the makers of this documentary for portraying a deceased female soldier, too.  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been raging for almost eight years now and female warriors, although only two percent of the casualties in Iraq, get very little mention.  Kudos also for portraying the ""resident alien"" warriors who have lost their lives in these wars.This DVD is not quite as in-your-face as ""Baghdad ER"" from the same produces, however, for those who have lost loved ones in either war, this DVD shows many (but not all) behind-the-scenes events at Section 60.",3,"Good, but  at  times too emotional",1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,3029,"['Desert', 'Storm', 'commander', 'General', 'H', 'Norman', 'Schwarzkopf', 'once', 'said', 'mothers', 'fathers', 'America', 'will', 'give', 'sons', 'daughters', 'confidence', 'will', 'not', 'needlessly', 'waste', 'lives', 'dare', 'not', 'burden', 'mantle', 'leadership', 'places', 'could', 'be', 'person', 'who', 'orders', 'will', 'bring', 'deaths', 'thousands', 'thousands', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'awesome', 'responsibility', 'can', 'not', 'fail', 'dare', 'not', 'fail', 'three', 'stars', 'were', 'first', 'review', 'DVD', 'second', 'review', 'felt', 'better', 'documentary', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'star-ratings', 'anymore.I', 'was', 'stationed', 'Fort', 'Myer', 'Arlington', 'National', 'Cemetery', 'summer', '1995', 'would', 'proudly', 'watch', 'many', 'burials', 'could', 'Old', 'Guard', 'stationed', 'touching', 'job', 'veteran', 'burried', 'there', 'fact', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'American', 'watch', 'military', 'funeral', 'when', 'visiting', 'Arlington', 'National', 'Cemetery', 'lot', 'scenes', 'military', 'burial', 'wish', 'documentarians', 'had', 'shown', 'more', 'just', 'digging', 'graves', 'why', 'originally', 'gave', 'DVD', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'solid', 'four', 'stars', 'more', 'appropriate.The', 'DVD', 'background', 'noises', 'first', 'bothered', 'can', 'hear', 'jets', 'taking', 'off', 'background', 'hear', 'traffic', 'George', 'Washington', 'Parkway', 'Sometimes', 'wind', 'blew.However', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'argue', 'DVD', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'When', 'servicemembers', 'die', 'get', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'country', 'not', 'just', 'lose', 'warrior', 'gains', 'entire', 'families', 'friends', 'who', 'grieve', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'DVD', 'how', 'young', 'mothers', 'wives', 'young', 'children', 'most', 'touching', 'former', 'comrades-in-arms', 'mourning', 'tombstones', 'deceased.I', 'am', 'Iraqi', 'War', 'veteran', 'was', 'there', 'height', 'insurgency', '2006-2007', 'daily', 'casualty', 'toll', 'times', 'was', 'demoralizing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'young', 'soldiers', 'come', 'back', 'patrol', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'young', 'enlisted', 'folk', 'who', 'witness', 'deaths', 'comrades-in-arms', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tired', 'grieving', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'brought', 'back', 'moments', 'intense', 'pain', 'sadness', 'reason', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'everyone', 'else', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'returning', 'Iraq', 'sleeping', 'night', 'was', 'especially', 'difficult', 'first', 'year.Kudos', 'makers', 'documentary', 'portraying', 'deceased', 'female', 'soldier', 'too', 'wars', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'have', 'been', 'raging', 'almost', 'eight', 'years', 'now', 'female', 'warriors', 'only', 'two', 'percent', 'casualties', 'Iraq', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'mention', 'Kudos', 'also', 'portraying', 'resident', 'alien', 'warriors', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'lives', 'wars.This', 'DVD', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'in-your-face', 'Baghdad', 'ER', 'same', 'however', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'war', 'DVD', 'many', 'not', 'behind-the-scenes', 'events', 'Section', '60']",Section 60: Arlington National Cemetery

I wanted to turn in off several times because I couldn't help but cry during parts.Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery is where military killed in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. The films shows loved ones of fallen military at the cemetery, some talking to each other, some talking to the gravestones. Many are young women, some have become friends with each other, which shows they spend a lot of time there. One young woman had her two very young children with her, and they sang Happy Birthday to their daddy, who would have been 30 years old. There were many parents, and especially mothers, visiting their sons' graves.I felt sadness on a couple of different levels. As the wife of a military man who made it home from Iraq, I felt grief for the families and while I didn't go through what they did, I always felt that was a possibility and played that through my mind at times while he was over there. As a mother, I feel pain for the mothers of soldiers who won't return.

It is terrible when men and women die to protect their country (or someone else's), but these are not stories, they are statistics. And statistics are, by their very nature, somewhat dry and unengaging.Not this film. If the reporting on the nightly news is war examined at the macroscopic level, this is the casualties of war on the microscopic level. We see people grieve for friends, lovers and family members who lost their lives in war. These are not statistics, and we cannot view this film and think of them in such a light. These are tragedies, one and all. And the fact that these people died serving their country makes them heroes as well. Seeing the fallout of deaths from military service, so raw and so personal, is incredibly moving.It doesn't matter how you feel about war. It doesn't matter whether you feel that some of these people lost their lives in a ""just"" war. None of the people whose graves are visited in this film started those wars. But they all lost their lives serving what was presumably a greater good and at the direction of those who would have us believe it so.This film should be required viewing for anyone contemplating the desirability of sending troops for the next altercation. THIS is the cost. This will ALWAYS be the cost. And the next war, somewhere, for some reason, will always--human nature being what it is--be looming.

Especially in those moments dealing with children, such as the family with two little girls singing Happy Birthday to their departed father.  There were other vignettes that were also moving, and I am glad that I have seen this film.  But, who do I recommend this movie to?  It's a film for an audience that I'm not sure really exists.  I have briefly seen into the pain of those that lost someone, but I can't say I know more deeply understand nor share that pain.

There are definitely some people that won't care for it at all. It seems almost like you are looking in on very personal moments real people are having....and you indeed are. This is true documentary style, with no narration, no musical score, it is filmed as if you are just walking through the cemetery and meeting the people there. Can I truly understand their pain and grief? Definitely not. And this film doesn't really make any commentary on war or why these people died...to me it's just an incredibly stark reminder of how many have died and how many families and loved ones will mourn every day for the rest of their lives. I don't think you can watch this movie and not feel a more heart-felt stab at a news report of another soldier lost in battle. Every one of them has a story behind them and it's clear in this movie that this is what the families want...for their loved one to be remembered.So as a movie, I definitely recommend this. But it's a little harder to recommend purchasing the DVD at such a high price. There are no extras on this, and for a less-than-two hour movie, the price at the time I'm reviewing this of $24.95 seems rather high, so I have to dock a star for that.

1198548,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B001GQ3ED2,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[1, 1]","As I begin, let me note that I have subscribed to HBO for many years now, with a small break or two along the way, but for the most part I've subscribed to HBO for well over a decade.  Why do I 'pay' for TV, especially premium prices for a channel like HBO?  Because of films and content like Section 60: Arlington National Cemetery (and the very recently aired, excellent film Taking Chance, which would be a great companion piece to this film).HBO has done many excellent original films during my time as a subscriber. The list is long, and highly distinguished, including many military themed films and/or mini-series events (Band of Brothers comes to mind).  Section 60 is one of the latest in the series of films that help HBO earn the honors they are lauded with.Section 60 is an HBO Documentary, running approx. 60 incredible minutes, which introduces viewers to ""the saddest acre in America.""  The name-sake Section 60 that the documentary takes the title from is the newest section of Arlington National Cemetery, the section where military personnel killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan may be buried. Unfortunately, that Section 60 has been filling with too many victims, and too many family members and loved ones have had to visit and pay their respects to the departed.Section 60, the HBO documentary is fascinating for the way it treats the family members and all of the subject matter with dignity and respect, and also for the glimpses into the way that the family members are shown bonding with others that have also lost loved ones.  What viewers of the documentary see is how members of the military are also part of a much larger family, a brotherhood and sisterhood of military personnel and their extended families.Thankfully HBO filmed the documentary without a narrator, and no apparent bias in who and what is shown.  The result is a film that is a great introduction to the sacrifices of the military, and the final resting place for so many heroes.Originally aired on HBO in October 2008, I saved Section 60 (the film) on my HD DVR when it aired and have started to watch it several times, only to feel that I just couldn't make it through a complete viewing before, well, now.  Having received the DVD from Amazon, I finally resolved to view the copy on the DVR and compare it to the DVD.  The copy on the HD DVR was recorded from HBO's high definition channel, as I've become more of an HD snob and refused to watch standard definition content except in rare cases.  That includes standard DVD material, as I'd rather wait for Blu-ray versions of content that I really want to see.  I have to note that in comparing the material that is on the DVD, it compares very favorably to the version that I can watch from my HD DVR.  While neither version is what I would call high definition material, both looked really nice, though it's hard to tell for sure through the 'dust' that seems to be bothering my eyes through a lot of the viewing of material.I would hope that DVDs of this great documentary are distributed far and wide through the educational system where young people can be educated about current events and military service history.",5,This place is special.
