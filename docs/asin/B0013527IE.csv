On the way back to Dubai in 2003, I had come across philosopher Gaita's The Philosopher's Dog. I bought it, read it and passed it on to our philosopher son Jeremy (The Ecological Life) to read. Shortly after, Jeremy picked up Gaita's Romulus, My Father, and returned the favor by passing it on to me to read.  I found it exceptionally well written and deeply moving.Let me start by saying that the movie of Romulus, My Father is exquisitely filmed. It's all light and shadows,  sepia browns and yellows in the back country of Australia, the movie analogue of those great photographs of the Depression by Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. The acting, too, is first rate. Eric Bana (Munich) is a perfect choice for the father, conveying emotion even when still and displaying the essential gravity and weight of Gaita's working class father plays the father. ALL the actors are first rate. The story tells of young Rai's growing up caught between a strong, almost Old Testament father and an emotionally and mentally troubled mother who drifts in and out of the family wreaking havoc wherever she lands. Another virtue of the film is the dramatic use of stillness, which gives the viewer time to let his or her feelings grow of their own accord. The movie won several awards in Australia but received almost no critical notice in this country.

1140347,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0013527IE,Grady Harp,"[22, 22]","Raimond Gaita is not a name widely known to the world outside Australia where he serves as a professor of philosophy, writing extensively on 'skepticism (moral, of other minds and of the external world), on the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of psychology, on aspects of political philosophy (collective responsibility, the role of moral considerations in politics, genocide and the alleged uniqueness of the Holocaust), on education (the nature of teaching as a vocation, the role of love in learning and the plight of the universities) and on Wittgenstein's philosophy of mind and language'.  After this filmed version of his memoir ROMULUS, MY FATHER, he may well gain a larger audience.  This low budget film uses fewer words than silences and actions to depict the childhood of Gaita in the period around 1960. For many it may seem an aimless, prolonged, sad film, but for others it will deliver a life force in a sensitive child that is indomitable.Romulus Gaita (Eric Bana)  immigrated to Australia from Yugoslavia with his wife  Christina (Franka Potente) and their son Raimond (Kodi Smit-McPhee).  Romulus works as a blacksmith and farmer to support his family: Christina is not happy with the confinement of marriage and motherhood and finds frequent reasons to have promiscuous jaunts away from her small house and maternal duties. Romulus and Raimond are very close and find ways to exist without Christina, especially when Christina has an extended affair with a family friend Mitru (Russell Dykstra) and has a child by him.  Despite warm support from Raimond and  his best friend Hora (Marton Csokas), Romulus decompensates and his radical behavior results in his hospitalization in a mental institution.  How Raimond's bond with his beloved father endures despite the endless tragedies that befall his 'home' provides the closure of this tender memoir.Nick Drake provides the screenplay from Gaita's book, Richard Roxburgh directs, Basil Hogios provides the sparse musical score for Geoffrey Simpson's magnificent cinematography of the desolate plains of Australia. But it is the solid performances by Eric Bana and  Kodi Smit-McPhee as father and son that make this film so memorable.

Both father and son try everything in their power to help the woman extricate herself from the troubled life she has created, but in doing so, they come very close to wrecking their own lives.Not a happy story.

The major obstacle to the family's stability and happiness is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men.  Despite her highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce, masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him.  It is, unfortunately, the good-hearted and good-natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie (Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author).Even though I admire ""Romulus, My Father"" for what it is trying to do, I can't honestly say I enjoyed it, for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it,  these simply aren't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing, which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen.

1140355,AZBMTXXNPS6YD,B0013527IE,"Subauthor ""jeffgonsalves dot com""","[1, 1]","""Romulus, My Father"" is being touted as an ode to father-son relationships. As portrayed by this film, however, it plays more as a tribute to childhood resilience. The father suffers through incredible loss, but his son seems more profoundly affected by the damaged adults around him. Franka Potente and Eric Bana provide solid performances, but the true star is Kodi McPhee, who has to wrestle with a wide array of emotion. He succeeds completely. There wasn't one false note in his portrayal of the son of a mentally-disturbed mother and an aloof, brooding father. Kodi shows more emotion in one scene than Bana and Potente do in the entire movie.Bana plays a man who shares a few tender moments with his son on an isolated Australian ranch, but for the most part he remains distant and detached. He rarely smiles, his face carved with worry. His wife returns from hospitalization in a psychiatric institution but doesn't seem improved. She shows affection periodically, but is never consistent in her actions, and spends most of her screen time smoking and staring into space despondently. The movie never explains why she is so disaffected, but it has obviously taken its toll on Bana, who tries to be a good father and husband, but is slowly tortured by her impulsiveness and self-absorbed immaturity. When she has a baby, she ignores its wailing and would rather sit in a trance-like state than feed it. In many ways, the boy is the parent. He survives a marathon of tragedies that would crush most children's psyches.Among the horrors visited upon this boy are: watching a man exterminating chickens with a shovel because they are diseased, being pummeled by his father because he lied, watching his mother get savagely beaten by a man who can no longer stand her uncaring behavior, having to stay with his mother and try to keep her awake after she overdoses on pills, and almost getting an axe buried in his skull when his father dissociates in a furious rampage and doesn't recognize him. Many moments are brutally honest. One favorite is when the boy gets angry at his father for infidelity and blasts music in the shed, trying to use frantic dancing to show defiance. Later he will try to surface feelings of joy with the music, but finds he cannot. Another moment is when his mother comes to visit and he rebukes her in a restaurant. The boy has grown weary of her childishness and tells a professor at school that he does not want contact with her anymore.The film does not gloss over the emotional scars inflicted on the boy. A scene at the end involving a rifle shows that he is teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The movie begins and ends with a simple ritual that provides a flicker of hope for the future. That the boy survives and succeeds in life is a testament to the strength of a child who hasn't reached adulthood yet and is willing to believe that anything can get better with time.",4,Triumph Over Insurmountable Adversity,1261180800,"12 19, 2009",2009,2919,"['Romulus', 'Father', 'being', 'touted', 'ode', 'father-son', 'relationships', 'portrayed', 'film', 'however', 'more', 'tribute', 'childhood', 'resilience', 'father', 'suffers', 'incredible', 'loss', 'son', 'more', 'profoundly', 'affected', 'damaged', 'adults', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'provide', 'solid', 'performances', 'true', 'star', 'Kodi', 'McPhee', 'who', 'wrestle', 'wide', 'array', 'emotion', 'completely', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'false', 'note', 'portrayal', 'son', 'mentally-disturbed', 'mother', 'aloof', 'brooding', 'father', 'Kodi', 'more', 'emotion', 'one', 'scene', 'Bana', 'Potente', 'do', 'entire', 'movie.Bana', 'man', 'who', 'shares', 'few', 'tender', 'moments', 'son', 'isolated', 'Australian', 'ranch', 'most', 'part', 'distant', 'detached', 'rarely', 'face', 'carved', 'worry', 'wife', 'returns', 'hospitalization', 'psychiatric', 'institution', ""n't"", 'seem', 'improved', 'affection', 'periodically', 'never', 'consistent', 'actions', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'smoking', 'staring', 'space', 'despondently', 'movie', 'never', 'why', 'so', 'disaffected', 'obviously', 'taken', 'toll', 'Bana', 'who', 'be', 'good', 'father', 'husband', 'slowly', 'tortured', 'impulsiveness', 'self-absorbed', 'immaturity', 'When', 'baby', 'wailing', 'would', 'rather', 'sit', 'trance-like', 'state', 'feed', 'many', 'ways', 'boy', 'parent', 'marathon', 'tragedies', 'would', 'crush', 'most', 'children', 'psyches.Among', 'horrors', 'visited', 'boy', 'are', 'watching', 'man', 'exterminating', 'chickens', 'shovel', 'are', 'diseased', 'being', 'pummeled', 'father', 'lied', 'watching', 'mother', 'get', 'savagely', 'beaten', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'stand', 'uncaring', 'behavior', 'having', 'stay', 'mother', 'try', 'keep', 'awake', 'pills', 'almost', 'getting', 'axe', 'buried', 'skull', 'when', 'father', 'furious', 'rampage', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Many', 'moments', 'are', 'brutally', 'honest', 'One', 'favorite', 'when', 'boy', 'angry', 'father', 'infidelity', 'blasts', 'music', 'shed', 'trying', 'use', 'frantic', 'dancing', 'show', 'defiance', 'Later', 'will', 'try', 'surface', 'feelings', 'joy', 'music', 'can', 'not', 'moment', 'when', 'mother', 'visit', 'restaurant', 'boy', 'grown', 'weary', 'childishness', 'professor', 'school', 'not', 'want', 'contact', 'anymore.The', 'film', 'not', 'gloss', 'emotional', 'scars', 'inflicted', 'boy', 'scene', 'end', 'involving', 'rifle', 'teetering', 'edge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'movie', 'simple', 'ritual', 'flicker', 'hope', 'future', 'boy', 'survives', 'life', 'testament', 'strength', 'child', 'who', ""n't"", 'reached', 'adulthood', 'yet', 'willing', 'believe', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'time']",N/A

In some ways Hora is an even more solid role model for Raimond than Romulus though both Romulus and Hora are hard-working, honorable men.Raimond's almost perpetual playfulness, determination, and ability to live in his own happy moment despite what is going on around him carries the story and the film through otherwise soul-breaking tragedies.Unfortunately this DVD did not include English subtitles.  Subtitles would have been very helpful when dialogue was almost inaudible and/or difficult to understand given the Central European, German, and Australian accents.",4,Where are the kangaroos?,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1122,"['Eric', 'Bana', 'Romulus', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Central', 'European', 'immigrant', 'Australia', 'trying', 'raise', 'son', 'Raimond', 'farm', 'Frogmore', 'Victoria', 'Australia', 'wife', 'Raimond', 'mother', 'disappears', 'lives.At', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'precocious', 'Raimond', 'insists', 'remaining', 'boy', 'demands', 'adults', 'take', 'up', 'roles', 'are', 'unwilling', 'unable', 'fill.Romulus', 'best', 'friend', 'Hora', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'inspirational', 'support', 'best', 'friend', 'best', 'friend', 'son', 'ways', 'Hora', 'even', 'more', 'solid', 'role', 'model', 'Raimond', 'Romulus', 'Romulus', 'Hora', 'are', 'hard-working', 'honorable', 'men.Raimond', 'almost', 'perpetual', 'playfulness', 'determination', 'ability', 'live', 'own', 'happy', 'moment', 'what', 'going', 'story', 'film', 'otherwise', 'soul-breaking', 'tragedies.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'helpful', 'when', 'dialogue', 'was', 'almost', 'inaudible', 'and/or', 'difficult', 'understand', 'given', 'Central', 'European', 'German', 'Australian', 'accents']",N/A
