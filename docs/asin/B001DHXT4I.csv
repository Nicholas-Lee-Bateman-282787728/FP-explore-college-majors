I've watched the entire series twice and am ready to go another round anytime.  Jim Nabors' Gomer Pyle series fills many hours with great joy and laughs.  Not only do I enjoy Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton, but a lot of favorite, classic stars have guest appearances throughout the series:  Carol Burnett (2), ""Andy Taylor, Aunt Bea, Opie Taylor,"" Ruta Lee, Don Rickles, Allan Melvin (who was not household name but in so many classic TV shows you will immediately recognize him), and more.  The Carol Burnett episodes are hilarious.  Any surprise?  I have only two negative issues with the series:  Lou Anne's southern accent was so over-exaggerated, it makes my Deep South eyes roll (but her clothes were awesome); and some of the plots in the later seasons remind me of plots from the Andy Griffith Show.  Were they running out of material?  Even so, these are minor, minor issues.  I adore the series!  If only we were all as honest and innocent as Gomer Pyle.  For all of the trouble his un-relenting honesty, trust and innocence caused, it always worked out for the good.  The quality of the picture is great.  The first season is black and white.  Seasons 2 - 5 are in color.  In the first season, Jim Nabors recorded a short synopsis of each episode.  The set includes one episode from the Jim Nabors Hour with Frank Sutton and Ronnie Schnell.

Jim Nabors made a few guest appearances on Andy Griffith and not long afterwards producer Sheldon Leonard as well as Griffith himself knew Nabors is a winning comic. Indeed they were right. Gomer Pyle had a five year run with the first season in black and white. Frank Sutton played the loud but lovable Sergeant Carter. I would recommend this series if you want to find a sitcom that actually is clean, family oriented and funny. There are a few episodes in the series where the folks in Mayberry do make an appearance. In one episode, Andy Taylor's son Opie actually makes an appearance on base where Andy also appears at the end of the episode. Jim Nabors gives audio introductions to the first season episodes and it also includes the pilot from the Andy Griffith show when Andy goes with him as he enters the marine corp.

1181059,A2HQJ9ORCC1EZN,B001DHXT4I,William D. Wolf,"[2, 2]","I was pleasantly surprised of how well the episodes were written that were both funny and helped me to learn a little about the Marine Corp and the military in general. This show almost made you want to join the Marine Corp as long as you would be in the Second Platoon B Company squad with Gomer Pyle and Sergeant Carter. I can relate more as an adult to this show rather than when I was a kid watching it as reruns.These DVDs are definitely well worth buying all of the episodes at once. The DVDs are all one sided discs and have individually packed seasons instead of stacked discs like some of the other complete TV series programs are doing today. The DVDs have some good extras of the Jim Nabors show and the Doris Day show. Other than that, the discs are basic episodes of Gomer Pyle without the commercials with good divisions to help jump into the episode if you want to skip the introduction. I only wish that they had vintage commercials when it was originally broadcast as an extra to the DVD.Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton are very talented actors that had a great chemistry together. I had seen a lot of familiar actors before they became famous in these episodes also. I liked the vibrant colors of the film in those shows back then. It looked as if they used a very high quality transformation from well preserved original film like it would have been made today instead of back in the 1960s on the color episodes. This the best digital remastering I have seen among my classic comedy 1960s show collection.Well worth the investment considering that cable keeps on going up in price and never has anything good on. Buying all five seasons is the price of one month's cable if not less than one month's cable bill without the commercials and the convenience of watching it when you want to.",5,A classic comedy that is dynamic and well written,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,1802,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'episodes', 'were', 'written', 'were', 'funny', 'helped', 'learn', 'little', 'Marine', 'Corp', 'military', 'general', 'show', 'almost', 'made', 'want', 'join', 'Marine', 'Corp', 'as', 'long', 'would', 'be', 'Second', 'Platoon', 'B', 'Company', 'squad', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'Sergeant', 'Carter', 'can', 'relate', 'more', 'adult', 'show', 'rather', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'watching', 'reruns.These', 'DVDs', 'are', 'definitely', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', 'episodes', 'once', 'DVDs', 'are', 'one', 'sided', 'discs', 'have', 'individually', 'packed', 'seasons', 'instead', 'stacked', 'discs', 'other', 'complete', 'TV', 'series', 'programs', 'are', 'doing', 'today', 'DVDs', 'have', 'good', 'extras', 'Jim', 'Nabors', 'show', 'Doris', 'Day', 'show', 'Other', 'discs', 'are', 'basic', 'episodes', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'commercials', 'good', 'divisions', 'help', 'jump', 'episode', 'want', 'skip', 'introduction', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'vintage', 'commercials', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'extra', 'DVD.Jim', 'Nabors', 'Frank', 'Sutton', 'are', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'had', 'seen', 'lot', 'familiar', 'actors', 'became', 'famous', 'episodes', 'also', 'liked', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'film', 'shows', 'back', 'then', 'looked', 'used', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'transformation', 'well', 'preserved', 'original', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'today', 'instead', 'back', '1960s', 'color', 'best', 'digital', 'remastering', 'have', 'seen', 'classic', 'comedy', '1960s', 'show', 'collection.Well', 'investment', 'considering', 'cable', 'keeps', 'going', 'up', 'price', 'never', 'anything', 'good', 'Buying', 'five', 'seasons', 'price', 'one', 'month', 'cable', 'not', 'less', 'one', 'month', 'cable', 'bill', 'commercials', 'convenience', 'watching', 'when', 'want']","Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. - Complete Series, Seasons 1-5"
