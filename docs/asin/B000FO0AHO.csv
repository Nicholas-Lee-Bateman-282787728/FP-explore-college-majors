This was a more personal portrait of the queen and Helen Mirren did a wonderful job portraying the difficulties of a queen trying to snatch love from the jaws of a demanding kingdom.  She was a delight to watch as she carried off the role physically, and switched between woman and queen, sometimes both at once, in a world where she was expected to fail and hand over her power to a protective male. This is a very well done production and well worth watching.  The clothing and sets are of interest as well.",4,"Engrossing, touching.",1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,622,"['Elizabeth', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'historical', 'figures', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'versions', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'personal', 'portrait', 'queen', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'difficulties', 'queen', 'trying', 'snatch', 'love', 'jaws', 'demanding', 'kingdom', 'was', 'delight', 'watch', 'carried', 'role', 'physically', 'switched', 'woman', 'queen', 'sometimes', 'once', 'world', 'where', 'was', 'expected', 'fail', 'hand', 'power', 'protective', 'male', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'production', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'clothing', 'sets', 'are', 'interest', 'well']",Elizabeth I

992910,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FO0AHO,A Customer,"[17, 18]","Twenty years into her reign and Queen Elizabeth the 1st is facing threats both internal and external. Spain  - led by the pope - is determined to conquer England and rid this country of the heretic Queen. Whilst spies and traitors seek to depose her, Elizabeth (Helen Mirren) constantly under pressure to marry and produce an heir, is intent to root out all those betrayers, determined to protect the English Protestant Church and her hold on the throne.Her efforts to protect her country and her people do indeed come at a price. As a woman with such power, she knows that there are men in positions of control who are more than ready to take over the top job. Mirren offers a completely convincing picture of a smart, calculating woman whose private needs clash with her desire for power in a world otherwise run by men. Elizabeth faces huge challenges and determined enemies, and her responses are similarly gigantic.Elizabeth knows she can trust the Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons). Indeed, she is deeply in love with him, and they have some passionate, intimate moments, but something keeps holding her back. There's nothing apparently, that would compromise Elizabeth's reputation as the Virgin Queen. It is the Earl of Leicester, however, that connects her with his stepson, the devastatingly handsome Earl of Essex who proves to be the Queen's ultimate romantic nemesis.Essex is a man with too much faith in his own sexual charm - he's gorgeous, but also a bit of a philanderer and unfortunately has eyes for the other ladies of the court. Outwardly he loves the Queen and is passionate about her, but inwardly he has his own agenda. He nags Elizabeth for a position on the Privy Council and then mistakenly accuses her faithful doctor of treason. Does he want to become King? Perhaps, but the prospect is unlikely, as the Queen must marry royalty.Elizabeth becomes enraged when she learns Essex has been sent to Lisbon without her approval, and she joins a worshiping throng to celebrate his return. But when Essex is charged with impregnating a young woman of the court, Elizabeth feels betrayed and roars at him with as much vitriol as she can muster. Eventually, a lover's quarrel morphs into a small-scale civil war, one in which Essex and his forces don't stand a chance of seizing the throne, but try anyway.The politics of the time constantly leave Elizabeth's patience in shatters. Against her better judgment she orders the execution of her cousin, the very Catholic Mary Queen of Scots (beautifully played by Barbara Flynn). But the beheading isn't a clean break, and Mary is ultimately denied her rosary and her priest. When Elizabeth hears about this she becomes distraught and only the levelheaded Earl of Rochester can calm her.Written by Nigel Williams and directed by Tom Hooper, Elizabeth 1 brings to the screen all the power plays, court machinations and religious fervor of the time. Catholics are pitted against Protestants, and Elizabeth's political enemies are literally disemboweled in an endless display of retribution and reprisal. The movie does take some liberties with history - the dramatic meeting between Elizabeth and Mary of Scots never took place and I can't believe she would fall apart and cry in front of the Privy Council.Obviously Elizabeth had the stomach for all the violence and sending people to beheaded - indeed she even ordered most of it! - But even in her darkest hour, when there was a real possibility that she would lose her throne, she managed to hold it together, even at the expense of her own heart.

992911,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000FO0AHO,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Sometimes it is funny to think about how you learn things as a kid and they stick with you until you go to reexamine them later. That seems especially true about history. Sometimes it is covered with so much banality and rot that it is hard to get the story straight. Old Queen Bess fell into that category. If one compares a film version from the 1950's of how she was perceived and this production, except for the names of the parties, it might as well be two different people. And this is only film. What the hell is the real her-story then?In the schoolboy histories of my youth Henry VIII's daughter, Queen Elizabeth I, old Bess of blessed memory, who reigned in England during the turbulent last half of the 16th century, had the sobriquet of the Virgin Queen. Of course we were kids then and did know any better about the real ways of royal politics and intricacies of adult romance so that label kind of stuck.The film under review goes a long way to visually shifting that image as Helen Mirren as the first Elizabeth presents us with a full-blooded and somewhat coquettish Emmy-winning performance. But, wait a minute, didn't Mirren just play the modern Elizabeth and get an Oscar for it. Yes. I believe that I am right. Frankly, old Bess is a hell of a lot more interesting as she seeks romance (with the likes of the Earl of Leicester and later the youthful Earl of Sussex) and the enhancement of the royal prerogative in a long and apparently personally unhappy reign. Off Mirren's performance here though I am glad that Cromwell and the boys in the next century did not have such a ruthless adversary in Charles I. The success of the Commonwealth might have been a much nearer thing.The story line here centrally revolves around Elizabeth's struggle (like her father's) to enhance the royal power, as is to be expected, but also, as is the norm in dynastic politics, to insure the line of succession. Hovering all through this saga is the question of when or whether Bess will product an heir. In the end we know that she did not and James VI of Scotland (as James I) came on board. However, along the way Bess insured by her policies that England would remain a Protestant country (despite the intrigues of Mary, Queen of Scots and others), that England would become an important naval and mercantile power and that, for a time, the centralizing role of the crown would keep the feuding nobility at bay.

992914,A6F61DLQJEURB,B000FO0AHO,Andrea Bowhill,"[12, 13]","Elizabeth I - Quick Brief Background the early years before this production startsTudor Queen of England Elizabeth I was born in Greenwich on the 7th September 1533, the only daughter of Henry VIII and his Second wife Anne Boleyn. When Elizabeth was two Anne was beheaded for adultery on the orders of Henry and Elizabeth was exiled from court, her childhood remained a difficult one but she received her protestant education. Upon Henry's death, Elizabeth's older half sister Mary became Queen in 1553, Mary was to re-establish Catholicism in England and viewed Elizabeth as her greatest threat so much so that Elizabeth herself for a time was imprisoned in the Tower of London where every day she lived in fear of her death warrant being signed. Mary took pity and sent Elizabeth back into exile, Elizabeth succeeds to the throne in 1558 aged 25 one of her priorities was to establish and secure England back to Protestantism. Elizabeth was constantly challenged from the Catholics with there many dark plots, therefore Elizabeth reign always remained on a knifes edge, Elizabeth greatest challenge came from her Catholic cousin Mary Queen of Scots.Elizabeth I - The Production 1579 Episode oneThis production begins 20 Years into Elizabeth I reign 1579 she had so far refused to marry there was great uncertainty, without a husband there would be no heir therefore who would succeed to the throne, the consequences were great, danger of civil war between those competing for the succession, England was also in a vulnerable position to the likes of the Catholic powers, led by Spain waiting to seize the heretic Queen's throne.It opens with Elizabeth (Helen Mirren) being pressed by her privy councilors and parliament baiting her to enter a marriage of alliances namely with the Duke of Anjou (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Covillault) brother to the king of France, the councilors were trying to find a suitor to break up the Catholic alliance between France and Spain, by marrying the French Catholic Duke it would build a stronger force between England and France, while England remains protestant this puts England in a stronger position keeping peace with Spain. We proceed through this episode showing the trails and tribulations of what being a Queen takes in matters of love and friendship with the Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), War, Conspiracy and Power how a Queen at all times remains on her guard to show no feelings of the heart and keep her wits about her in matters of state. Mirren plays this Queen wonderfully in a light hearted, witty way, with classic charm.Elizabeth I - The Production 1589 - 1603 Episode TwoThere is no more talk of producing an heir to the Throne of England, The Spanish Armada has been defeated and this secures the English nation and the English Protestant Church. But who would succeed her? Who would take her extraordinary power for themselves? Conspiracy burning on the home front is rife, the Queen is growing older and insecurities begin to creep into her life, her old trusted friends have passed on and younger men of wealth and ambition look for her affection and power, one in particular the Earl of Essex, Robert Devereux, 19th Earl of Essex 2nd Devereux 1566 -1601, (played by Hugh Dancy) the Earl of Essex was good looking and famous for his charm he quickly became a favorite to the queen but he exploited his Queens Weaknesses throughout his life. Matters of the heart between Mirren and Dancy are acted out fantastically, Mirren shows the Queens true feelings of doubt, this episode takes us to Elizabeth death in 1603.Performances, Cast.I have a love of History Elizabeth I being my favorite Queen, This Production was made for TV and it was a lavish one, the scenery is superb with marvelous visual graphics showing the life and times, and the costumes are wonderful. Although the History in this is followed from what we know of Elizabeth I, history is outlined only in small parts of course the script writers have interceded to turn this into a story line to keep it entertaining, they were short on time so it takes us off track to Elizabeth's real life, a couple of Elizabeth I famous speeches remain  in. (The last Twenty Three years of Elizabeth's Life was packed with all sorts of goings on putting this into 210 minutes was always going to be difficult and the fact we don't really know what went on behind closed doors is also questioned marked, I would entice anyone to read up on Elizabeth I to get a full understanding of the history) but even so it's a fantastic production of story telling and I throughly enjoyed it.The cast is exceptionally Helen Mirren (This year has been great for Mirren) a classical actress of special significance she made her breakthrough at 19 as Queen Cleopatra in a national youth theatre Production, Oscar nominated at 50 for her affecting Queen Charlotte in the film The Madness of king George and now as Dame Helen Mirren winning an Emmy for this Elizabeth I production and went on to tackle Queen Elizabeth II, playing a Queen seems to suit her very well a women of extraordinary talent (Mirren Playing DS Jane Tennison TV series Prime Suspect is another great performance that should not be missed).Jeremy Irons winning a second Emmy for his performance in this Production as well, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Malahide, Ian Mcdiarmid and Toby Jones all put in wonderful performances with its great writing from Nigel Williams, and great roles from characters in English History. Fantastic, worth every penny.Heed my Warning to the faint hearted there are a few Gory violent scenes as part of this production.Extra's The Making of Elizabeth I + Uncovering the Real

As much as I liked the Cate Blanchett version (I bought the movie, and I buy very few movies) and the performances in that movie as well, it was a much softer version, for lack of a better term, and the Helen Mirren version is simply a better movie with a more realistic portrayal of the characters.I would not hesitate to recommend the Cate Blanchett and the Helen Mirren versions, because they are both excellent, both well-acted, and they cover different periods in Elizabeth's life.

Certainly, the best known and unforgettable of these are Dame Flora Robson, Betty Davis, Dame Judi Dench and more recently Cate Blanchett in  Shekhar Kapur's ""Elizabeth"" and ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"". In HBO's ""Elizabeth I"",  Helen Mirren's portrayal of England's greatest monarch shows an Elizabeth who has now moved past the flower of her youth into middle age and narrowing prospects of using her virginity as a political bargaining chip on the world power stage.  And yet it is no less a push by her Privy Council for her to find a husband and produce an heir and keep England safe and independent from a world that is far more Catholic than it is Protestant.  Jeremy Irons is certainly a well considered Lord Robert Dudley, who was the love of Queen Elizabeth I's life.  Irons and Mirren play beautifully off one another and the tenderness, even at times when they are at odds or at the passing of Dudley is a palpable thing both historically and on the screen.The movie is well researched, and the portrayal of Mary Queen of Scots was far more acurate than the version by Shekhar Kapur. Mary Queen of Scots spent most of her life in France and would have a decidedly French accent rather than a Scottish one.  HBO's producers of Elizabeth I thankfully did not omit this detail. Mirren gives a very good insight into a very complex and incredibly intelligent women who kept herself several steps ahead of her courtiers and ministers and someone who was very much the product of her father, King Henry VIII and mother, Ann Boelyn.  Helem Mirren shows us a glimpse of a woman who loved and loved deeply and yet was not free to live as other women lived and had to make decisions not just for her own considerations but for the people and Country to which she considered herself married to first and foremost.  No matter how you feel about Elizabeth I or the times in which England began to truly become an Empire, you can empathise with Mirren's Elizabeth right up until her legendary end.If you are interested in history, particularly the history of the Tudors and Elizabeth I, this is a film that is definitely not to miss. An important thing to note to those who are concerned about violence in film/  There are a few scenes depicting graphic violence dealing with torture, punishment and execution of those who went against the Crown.  The scene of the execution of Mary Queen of Scots showed that it took more than one strike of the executioner's axe to behead her.  While all of this is certainly in keeping with the times, it is not for children or the squeamish.",5,Helen Mirren's Elizabeth I is outstanding!,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,2630,"['are', 'countless', 'portrayals', 'Elizabeth', 'film', 'Certainly', 'best', 'known', 'unforgettable', 'are', 'Dame', 'Flora', 'Robson', 'Betty', 'Davis', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'more', 'recently', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'Elizabeth', 'Elizabeth', 'Golden', 'Age', 'HBO', 'Elizabeth', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'portrayal', 'England', 'greatest', 'monarch', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'now', 'moved', 'flower', 'youth', 'middle', 'age', 'narrowing', 'prospects', 'using', 'virginity', 'political', 'bargaining', 'chip', 'world', 'power', 'stage', 'yet', 'less', 'push', 'Privy', 'Council', 'find', 'husband', 'produce', 'heir', 'keep', 'England', 'safe', 'independent', 'world', 'far', 'more', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'certainly', 'well', 'considered', 'Lord', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'who', 'was', 'love', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'life', 'Irons', 'Mirren', 'play', 'beautifully', 'one', 'tenderness', 'even', 'times', 'when', 'are', 'odds', 'passing', 'Dudley', 'palpable', 'thing', 'historically', 'screen.The', 'movie', 'well', 'researched', 'portrayal', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'acurate', 'version', 'Shekhar', 'Kapur', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'France', 'would', 'have', 'decidedly', 'French', 'accent', 'rather', 'Scottish', 'one', 'HBO', 'producers', 'Elizabeth', 'thankfully', 'did', 'not', 'omit', 'detail', 'Mirren', 'very', 'good', 'insight', 'very', 'complex', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'women', 'who', 'kept', 'several', 'steps', 'ahead', 'courtiers', 'ministers', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'father', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'mother', 'Ann', 'Boelyn', 'Helem', 'Mirren', 'glimpse', 'woman', 'who', 'loved', 'loved', 'deeply', 'yet', 'was', 'not', 'free', 'live', 'other', 'women', 'lived', 'had', 'make', 'decisions', 'not', 'just', 'own', 'considerations', 'people', 'Country', 'considered', 'married', 'first', 'foremost', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'feel', 'Elizabeth', 'times', 'England', 'began', 'truly', 'become', 'Empire', 'can', 'empathise', 'Mirren', 'Elizabeth', 'right', 'up', 'legendary', 'end.If', 'are', 'interested', 'history', 'particularly', 'history', 'Tudors', 'Elizabeth', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'miss', 'important', 'thing', 'note', 'who', 'are', 'concerned', 'violence', 'film/', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'graphic', 'violence', 'dealing', 'torture', 'punishment', 'execution', 'who', 'went', 'Crown', 'scene', 'execution', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'showed', 'took', 'more', 'one', 'strike', 'executioner', 'axe', 'behead', 'certainly', 'keeping', 'times', 'not', 'children', 'squeamish']",Elizabeth I

Elizabeth (Helen Mirren) has been on the throne for twenty years. It's 1579 and she is 45 years old. We meet her at the conclusion of a discrete but public examination to establish for all to know that she is capable of bearing a child. The need for her to marry, both to ensure an heir and to ensure her survival as Queen, obsesses her councilors. For Elizabeth, it's not so simple. She is not just a queen, but a sovereign ruler, anointed, in her words, by God. She has the same passionate need for love and intimacy as her subjects. She probably realizes that marriage, in her era, would most likely lead to her own inevitable subordination to her husband if he is English or the subordination of the country to another country if he is foreign. She most probably realizes that by not making a choice, she keeps all the choices on the bargaining table.And, of course, there is the question of her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, now a prisoner but a continuing threat to her rule, whom her councillors want dead. There is her own passionate nature focussed on Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), and, later, on the young Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex (Hugh Dancy). One will die in bed; one will lose his head. There are religious issues so deeply held they could, and have, split the nation. Before long, there will be the threat of Spanish invasion to deal with. Through it all, Elizabeth procrastinates, twists and turns, takes a step forward and then one back. If we didn't already know her story so well, we might be surprised when we realize that in time the religious question is finessed with little violence, that Mary is dealt with, that the Spanish fail, that her people come to love her (more or less), that she invariably chooses her councilors well and they become dedicated to her, that she will be the one to make the final decisions and that rebellion is a fatal choice for those who disagree with her, even if they are one of her favorites. She is, in fact, a ruler who makes mistakes, can be swayed by vanity and avoids choices, but who when it matters makes the right choices.Helen Mirren does a masterful job, taking Elizabeth from 45 to Elizabeth's death at 69. Elizabeth could be fickle and imperious, but she had a core of steel, particularly when it came to defending her realm and her prerogatives. Mirren is such a dynamic and skilled actor it is entirely believable that the young Earl of Essex just might find the aging Queen an agreeable and intimate companion. Mirren is equally believable in demonstrating the iron will of a Queen who moves against someone she may well have loved.Mirren is at her best in dealing with complex emotions. When Elizabeth at last is brought to sign the order of execution for Mary but then tells the clerk to keep her action secret and not to show the document to anyone until she tells him, Mirren gives us a subtle portrait of Elizabeth, a Queen who knows it's in her best interests to have Mary executed but who flinches from being the one to make the order happen. At some level, Elizabeth must know that her order will not be kept secret, that it will be given to her councillors and that Walsingham will see to it that the execution takes place immediately. As Walsingham says, the Queen wants Mary executed but doesn't want to be the one responsible. It's a complex set of motives and emotions that Mirren has to display; they range from her reluctant signing to her hysteria when she learns Mary has been executed.Equally impressive is Mirren demonstrating the ability of Elizabeth to rouse the rabble with a combination of patriotism and bravado. She does a bravura job with Elizabeth's famous words before her army awaiting the Spanish invasion: ""Let tyrants fear; I have always so behaved myself that, under God, I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects. And therefore I am come amongst you at this time, not as for my recreation or sport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of the battle, to live or die amongst you all; to lay down, for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my honor and my blood, even the dust. I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England, too!""While Mirren dominates the story, all the actors are excellent. In major roles, in addition to Irons and Dancy, there is Patrick Malahyde as Sir Francis Walsingham, Toby Jones as Robert Cecil, Barbara Flynn as Mary and Ian McDiarmid as William Cecil.

992934,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B000FO0AHO,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[4, 4]","Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth I, the most popular (and one of the most potent) rulers in English history... How could you go wrong?  This is a dazzling production, true to the historical record (with a few speculative asides) with great acting, pacing and production values, and an intelligent, multi-layered script.  Mirren works her way through a near-infinite palette of human emotion, at times hitting the subtlest of notes, while later exploding with the heat and fury of a funeral pyre.  Her portrayal of Queen Bess offers modernity along with dignity and power... The script perhaps overplays Elizabeth's emotional vulnerablity -- there are a few too many scenes of her falling apart due to romantic frustration -- but it is such a pleasure to see Mirren at work, that even the parts that go overboard are welcome.Many aspects of this production are outstanding, most notably the costumes, which are jaw-droppingly ornate, as well as beautiful and well-suited to the various actors involved.  The cinematography is full of depth and range, with an interplay of light, color and shadow that clearly draws on the work of the old masters of Renaissance painting. The one weak note of the film is the acting of Hugh Dancy, who plays Robert Devereux, the young Earl of Essex, who initially appears as a love interest for the unmarried queen.  Dancy is appealing as a dashing, headstrong young flirt, but falters when the character ages and becomes an antagonist and political rival of the Queen.  Dancy simply lacks the gravitas to make the character believable, and viewers may wonder how such a callow, frantic young man could have inspired such alarm among the cool, savvy members of Elizabeth's advisors on the Privy Council.  (Plus, Jeremy Irons -- the romantic interest in the film's first episode -- is a hard act to follow.  Mirren and Irons simply sizzle together, while Dancy seems like a mere youth, still paying his dues in the acting world.)  That aside, this is a marvelous film, with a spectacular performance from Helen Mirren, a longtime favorite who still rises to new heights with every project she takes on.

992935,A26D5IRV2OLU4B,B000FO0AHO,D. Munro,"[2, 2]","Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons did such a splendid job in this series that part I is by far my favorite part. This film takes a different road than the Hollywood versions (""Elizabeth"" and its sequel, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"") and depicts the genuine love and maturity between them. Jeremy Irons was charming as the Earl of Leicester (pronounced ""Lester""), portraying that he was in love with Elizabeth, whom he called ""Bess."" Elizabeth depends upon him and he is many things to her, though in this version their love is never entirely physically consummated. We see them kiss, and there is a deep, mature love between the two of them despite pressure from the Privy Council that she should marry ... much to Leicester's dismay. Leicester is openly jealous of another's suit for Elizabeth's hand in marriage.  Elizabeth and Leicester walk a fine line: it's clear they love each other deeply, but Elizabeth sadly reminds him that if she ever marries, she must marry royalty.  Elizabeth seems content to keep Leicester by her side, until it is disclosed to her -- rather abruptly -- that her love, Leicester, has been secretly married to a woman already pregnant with his child. The news devastates her and she bans Leicester from court. Seven years later, they reconcile and renew their close friendship. Elizabeth is re-introduced to Leicester's stepson, Essex, with whom she later favored after Leicester's death. Leicester becomes gravely ill and dies with Elizabeth by his side, telling him that she loves him, and that he will always be with her. The chemistry between Helen and Jeremy was exquisite and lends a huge compliment to the much talked about historical romance of Leicester and Elizabeth.The second part depicts Elizabeth's rocky relationship with Essex, who, with his handsome face, youthful spirit, and quick wit, becomes her favorite after the death of Leicester. She kisses him and bestows great wealth upon him, however young Essex shows an extreme lack of maturity and humility when it comes to these favors. He acts out in rash ways, and she is disappointed by him repeatedly. When he attempts to rebel against her, he makes a fatal error. Unfortunately, it seems that part II was more about Elizabeth's loneliness and fear about growing old that may have contributed to her favor for Essex. In one scene, she laments that despite the name he shares with Leicester (Robert, whom she calls ""Robin""), they are nothing alike ... indicating that she truly longs for Leicester to be with her.Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast did a splendid job, though Helen and Jeremy delivered the standout performances. These two are highly gifted actors and it is a treat to watch them act together.  They are truly exquisite in their scenes together.  Jeremy Irons earned every award he got for this series.

992936,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000FO0AHO,Doug Anderson,"[12, 12]","This miniseries which focuses on the last twenty years of Elizabeth I's forty year reign (1579-1599) seems designed to showcase Helen Mirren's formidable talents as an actress who is capable of finding, connecting to, and bringing to light what is most human about her larger-than-life characters. In this HBO miniseries about the first Elizabeth as in the Stephen Frears directed feature The Queen (about the second Elizabeth) Helen Mirren has the uncanny ability of showing these monarchs not as abstractions or icons but as extremely complicated, extremeley conflicted, and extremely vulnerable individuals who are, nonetheless, forced to come to terms with the fact that for the people they represent and embody a supra-human ideal and to live up to this expectation they must always conduct themselves in accordance with this ideal. But to live this ideal comes with a terrible price for to live the ideal is to forego actually living life.Helen Mirren plays both Queen Elizabeth I & II as selfless public servants who must craft themselves according to the public will. Since her power as a monarch is dependent upon the goodwill that her people feel toward her neither Queen is ever free to make decisions based on self-interest but must always weigh her decisions/rulings and consider how they will benefit and/or serve the people. Even though Mirren shows how overbearing each Queen could, at times, be, ultimatley both Queens are seen to be little more than captives of the will of the people. The Queen's every wardrobe choice, every word, and every gesture is carefully crafted and carefully staged; she artfully manages her life to secure the loyalty of her subjects (which ultimatley means that she is their subject and not they hers); and, therefore, no decision the Queen makes is ever a private matter as even her love life is a matter of state. If, in the case of Elizabeth I, the people prefer that their Queen remain a virgin (and loyal only to them) then a virgin she will remain. And if, in the case of Elizabeth II, the people demand that their Queen pay her respects to ""the people's princess"" (Lady Di) then pay her respects she must.Though each Elizabeth is an entirely singular individual Helen Mirren really understands both Queens to be suffering the consequences of the same kind of extended confinement (which is, apparently, the common blight of royal life in any age).Both HBO's two-part Elizabeth I and Stephen Frears' The Queen are must-sees for two groups: fans of royal history and acting fans who wish to see an actor/actress at the top of his/her game.Also recommended to royal history buffs: David Starkey's two-part series Monarchy (about the English royals from the beginning to Charles II).Also recommended to Helen Mirren fans: The Painted Lady (1997); Prime Suspect seasons 1-6 (season 6 was directed by Elizabeth I's Tom Hooper); The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover (1989).",5,Helen Mirren's Elizabeths,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,2927,"['last', 'twenty', 'years', 'Elizabeth', 'forty', 'year', 'reign', '1579-1599', 'designed', 'showcase', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'formidable', 'talents', 'actress', 'who', 'capable', 'finding', 'connecting', 'bringing', 'light', 'what', 'most', 'human', 'larger-than-life', 'characters', 'HBO', 'first', 'Elizabeth', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'directed', 'feature', 'Queen', 'second', 'Elizabeth', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'showing', 'monarchs', 'not', 'abstractions', 'icons', 'extremely', 'complicated', 'extremeley', 'conflicted', 'extremely', 'vulnerable', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'forced', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'people', 'represent', 'embody', 'supra-human', 'ideal', 'live', 'up', 'expectation', 'must', 'always', 'conduct', 'accordance', 'ideal', 'live', 'ideal', 'terrible', 'price', 'live', 'ideal', 'forego', 'actually', 'living', 'life.Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'selfless', 'public', 'servants', 'who', 'must', 'craft', 'according', 'public', 'will', 'power', 'monarch', 'dependent', 'goodwill', 'people', 'feel', 'neither', 'Queen', 'ever', 'free', 'make', 'decisions', 'based', 'self-interest', 'must', 'always', 'weigh', 'decisions/rulings', 'consider', 'how', 'will', 'benefit', 'and/or', 'serve', 'people', 'Even', 'Mirren', 'how', 'overbearing', 'Queen', 'could', 'times', 'be', 'ultimatley', 'Queens', 'are', 'seen', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'captives', 'will', 'people', 'Queen', 'wardrobe', 'choice', 'word', 'gesture', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'carefully', 'staged', 'artfully', 'life', 'secure', 'loyalty', 'subjects', 'ultimatley', 'means', 'subject', 'not', 'hers', 'therefore', 'decision', 'Queen', 'ever', 'private', 'matter', 'even', 'love', 'life', 'matter', 'state', 'case', 'Elizabeth', 'people', 'prefer', 'Queen', 'remain', 'virgin', 'only', 'then', 'virgin', 'will', 'remain', 'case', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'people', 'demand', 'Queen', 'pay', 'respects', 'people', 'princess', 'Lady', 'Di', 'then', 'pay', 'respects', 'Elizabeth', 'entirely', 'singular', 'individual', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'really', 'Queens', 'be', 'suffering', 'consequences', 'same', 'kind', 'extended', 'confinement', 'apparently', 'common', 'blight', 'royal', 'life', 'age', 'HBO', 'two-part', 'Elizabeth', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'Queen', 'are', 'must-sees', 'two', 'groups', 'fans', 'royal', 'history', 'acting', 'fans', 'who', 'wish', 'see', 'actor/actress', 'top', 'his/her', 'game.Also', 'recommended', 'royal', 'history', 'buffs', 'David', 'Starkey', 'two-part', 'series', 'Monarchy', 'English', 'royals', 'beginning', 'Charles', 'II', '.Also', 'recommended', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'fans', 'Painted', 'Lady', '1997', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'seasons', '1-6', 'season', '6', 'was', 'directed', 'Elizabeth', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'Cook', 'Thief', 'Wife', 'Lover', '1989']",Elizabeth I

At a time when most ""actresses of a certain age"" are put out to pasture, the divine Ms. Mirren is proving that your 60's can be filled with boldness, vigor and a true triumph of artistic quality in film and television.Queen Elizabeth I has been played by so many different people, in so many different ways, but Mirren's take on the best of the Tudors (and England's most popular monarch) is so spot on that the viewer can believe she actually IS Elizabeth. The playful attitude, the daily capitulations, the love she shared for Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), it's all included in this quality work by HBO.The supporting cast is grand, especially my personal favorite Toby Jones as Sir Robert Cecil (Elizabeth's privy councilor and later Secretary of State). At times, Hugh Dancy (as the Earl of Essex, Robert Deveraux-the Earl of Leicester's stepson) seems a bit lost and too much the boy, not enough the man, to grab the Queen's attention, but the 2nd half of part II remedies that.There are of course some historical inaccuracies. Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth NEVER met (for some reason, filmmakers always like to include this in Scots-English history), the fact that Leicester married Elizabeth's cousin Lettice (Essex's mother) is not mentioned, and the Duke d'Anjou is shown to be more of a contemporary to the 45 year old monarch in this version (when in reality he was more than 2 decades younger than her).All in all, this is some of the finest pieces of acting one will see on television.

Here Elizabeth is in love with Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex (Hugh Dancy) while being prepped for a 'proper union' with France's royalty in the form of the Duke of Anjou (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Covillault).  But her 'love life' is only a small yet refreshingly nuanced portion of the long story. Mirren is fortunate to be supported by such fine actors as Jeremy Irons, Patrick Malahide, Toby Jones, Barbara Flynn, Ian McDiarmid, Simon Woods, Diana Kent, and  Toby Salaman among the many standout characters.The visual aspects of the production are some of the more luxurious ever placed on celluloid, with attention to detail in costuming (Mike O'Neill) and sets (Galius Klicius and Leon McCarthy) that are stunning to see.  The fine musical score is by Robert Lane and incorporates period music with works written for the piece that stand solidly as classical music compositions.  Cinematographers Dmitrij Gribanov and Larry Smith  find the right balance between court grandeur and boudoir intimacy. And of course kudos to Director Tom Hooper and writer Nigel Williams!But standing above them all is the brilliance of Helen Mirren's involvement as Elizabeth.  She provides us with even more information about the enigmatic queen, allowing us to see both the lusty woman and the brilliant monarch simultaneously.  The film is a joy!  Highly Recommended.

The film focuses on Queen Elizabeth once she is settled into her life as Queen. The main theme of the two parts is her two great loves of her life. Queen Elizabeth famously never married and used her single status to keep and maintain power in a male-dominated world. Her greatest love, which most historians will agree, is the main focus of part one. The second part focuses on a young man whose greed and lust for power gets him in trouble with the Queen on numerous occassions until she can no longer save him from the fate he chose. The movie will humanize Queen Elizabeth and show you that even though she was this iconic and one of the greatest Queens England ever had, she was human and did feel. She had to choose: to be Queen or to have love. She could never have both.I HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone who is interested in Queen Elizabeth, English history, or history in general.

992949,A364VIQ3KLAWVX,B000FO0AHO,H. M Pyles,"[27, 27]","Elizabeth Tudor was one of the most psychologically-complex rulers in history.  Alternately ignored and embraced by a tyrannical father who had her mother judicially murdered, coming very near to her own youthful death in prison at the hands of her half-sister Queen Mary, and threatened with invasion and assassination attempts throughout her reign, she -- almost uniquely among her contemporaries -- nevertheless steered a course of moderation that brought England through one of the most tumultuous periods in its history and left it poised to begin the reach for empire that was to give England dominance over the 19th century.Her long reign at a critical juncture of English history presents a panorama so large that it is virtually impossible to capture in anything less than a lengthy miniseries such as PBS undertook in the 1970's with Glenda Jackson's bravura performance . . . a miniseries plagued, unfortuately, by quickly outdated production values.  Given a choice imposed by a shorter format of whether to survey Elizabeth equally as both ruler and woman or to bring the camera in closer and to put more focus on one dimension than the other, Tom Hooper wisely chooses the latter.I am a voracious fan of Elizabeth's watershed reign but, frankly, it has been surveyed enough.  So I am pleased that Hooper chose to canvas the more complex side of Elizabeth the woman.  And I am ecstatic that he chose the amazing Helen Mirren to do the heavy lifting.  Certainly her job is made easier by a superb script with just the right balance between known events and intelligent guesses about the personal drives and private maneuvers behind those events.  And Hooper places her in physical settings built to the true color and scale of the Elizabethan court, not to the exaggerated imaginings of later generations which produced the Gothic horror show of sets in which Cate Blanchett was made to portray her highly-stylized Elizabeth.Elizabeth was a woman capable of bold maneuvers in the face of danger who nevertheless drove her council crazy with prolonged indecision.  She was a woman who could translate Greek into French, who practiced her music, and appreciated poetry -- but who likewise could don armor and stand as rousing orator in front of her army as the indominatable heir to Henry VIII.But, perhaps more than anything, she was a passionate, feeling woman whom fate had left with a deadly fear of marriage.  In an era when monarchs were expected to marry and produce heirs, she came from a family where marriage had been a death sentence more than once.  She lived in an era when women -- even queens -- were expected to subordinate their wishes and their estates to those of a husband.  She watched her dogmatic sister ""Bloody Mary"" plunge England into religious mayhem punctuated by a poor marriage choice.  She watched her cousin Mary Queen of Scots lose her throne over an imprudent marriage.Yet she loved and craved love throughout her life.  Ensconced in the propaganda of ""The Virgin Queen"" -- sufficient unto herself, chaste in person and under the sway of no Pope, no foreign Papist husband, and no English subject -- she nevertheless desperately craved the intimacy and security her role and her family history denied her.Telling this story is one of history's most instructive lessons on the price that power and success can exact on a person.  Telling it well is one of history's most entertaining offerings.  Telling it this well is one of those very rare events in film history.",5,Making 400 Years Ago Seem Like Yesterday . . .,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,3509,"['Elizabeth', 'Tudor', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'psychologically-complex', 'rulers', 'history', 'Alternately', 'ignored', 'embraced', 'tyrannical', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'mother', 'judicially', 'murdered', 'coming', 'very', 'near', 'own', 'youthful', 'death', 'prison', 'hands', 'half-sister', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'threatened', 'invasion', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'reign', 'almost', 'uniquely', 'contemporaries', 'nevertheless', 'steered', 'course', 'moderation', 'brought', 'England', 'one', 'most', 'tumultuous', 'periods', 'history', 'left', 'poised', 'begin', 'reach', 'empire', 'was', 'give', 'England', 'dominance', '19th', 'century.Her', 'long', 'reign', 'critical', 'juncture', 'English', 'history', 'panorama', 'so', 'large', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'capture', 'anything', 'less', 'lengthy', 'miniseries', 'such', 'PBS', 'undertook', '1970', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'bravura', 'performance', 'miniseries', 'plagued', 'unfortuately', 'quickly', 'outdated', 'production', 'values', 'Given', 'choice', 'imposed', 'shorter', 'format', 'survey', 'Elizabeth', 'equally', 'ruler', 'woman', 'bring', 'camera', 'closer', 'put', 'more', 'focus', 'one', 'dimension', 'other', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'wisely', 'latter.I', 'am', 'voracious', 'fan', 'Elizabeth', 'watershed', 'reign', 'frankly', 'been', 'surveyed', 'enough', 'am', 'pleased', 'Hooper', 'chose', 'canvas', 'more', 'complex', 'side', 'Elizabeth', 'woman', 'am', 'ecstatic', 'chose', 'amazing', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'do', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'Certainly', 'job', 'made', 'easier', 'superb', 'script', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'known', 'events', 'intelligent', 'guesses', 'personal', 'drives', 'private', 'maneuvers', 'events', 'Hooper', 'physical', 'settings', 'built', 'true', 'color', 'scale', 'Elizabethan', 'court', 'not', 'exaggerated', 'imaginings', 'later', 'generations', 'produced', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'show', 'sets', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'was', 'made', 'portray', 'highly-stylized', 'Elizabeth.Elizabeth', 'was', 'woman', 'capable', 'bold', 'maneuvers', 'face', 'danger', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'drove', 'council', 'crazy', 'prolonged', 'indecision', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'translate', 'Greek', 'French', 'who', 'practiced', 'music', 'appreciated', 'poetry', 'who', 'likewise', 'could', 'don', 'armor', 'stand', 'rousing', 'orator', 'front', 'army', 'indominatable', 'heir', 'Henry', 'VIII.But', 'perhaps', 'more', 'anything', 'was', 'passionate', 'feeling', 'woman', 'whom', 'fate', 'had', 'left', 'deadly', 'fear', 'marriage', 'era', 'when', 'monarchs', 'were', 'expected', 'marry', 'produce', 'heirs', 'came', 'family', 'where', 'marriage', 'had', 'been', 'death', 'sentence', 'more', 'once', 'lived', 'era', 'when', 'women', 'even', 'queens', 'were', 'expected', 'subordinate', 'wishes', 'estates', 'husband', 'watched', 'dogmatic', 'sister', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'plunge', 'England', 'religious', 'mayhem', 'punctuated', 'poor', 'marriage', 'choice', 'watched', 'cousin', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'lose', 'throne', 'imprudent', 'marriage.Yet', 'loved', 'craved', 'love', 'life', 'Ensconced', 'propaganda', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'sufficient', 'unto', 'herself', 'chaste', 'person', 'sway', 'Pope', 'foreign', 'Papist', 'husband', 'English', 'subject', 'nevertheless', 'desperately', 'craved', 'intimacy', 'security', 'role', 'family', 'history', 'denied', 'her.Telling', 'story', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'instructive', 'lessons', 'price', 'power', 'success', 'can', 'exact', 'person', 'Telling', 'well', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'entertaining', 'offerings', 'Telling', 'well', 'one', 'very', 'rare', 'events', 'film', 'history']",Elizabeth I

I've always been a fan of Helen Mirren, her acting has always impressed me in that she seems to always take on acting roles that deal with the reality of peoples lives.  However, she has outdone herself in this miraculous portrayal of Elizabeth the First.  The production of the film itself is absolutely superb and created with the skill of a very fine painter.  Most films done about historical characters with personalities bigger then life are often lofty, and almost surreal, though well done.  But this particular film with Helen Mirren as Elizabeth really focus on Elizabeth the woman, with her associates in her life as Queen of England  being just as human.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who may be having problems deciding as to whether they should purchase this film.  I certainly was paying very close attention to Helen Mirren when she played a detective on public television, but I do believe after this role as Queen Elizabeth, her acting career will and should enter new heights of character acting which I look forward to seeing in the future.",5,Helen Mirren Great Character Acting,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,1185,"['Amazon.com', 'asked', 'write', 'review', 'recent', 'purchase', 'Elizabeth', 'First', 'played', 'Helen', 'Mirren', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'acting', 'always', 'impressed', 'always', 'take', 'acting', 'roles', 'deal', 'reality', 'peoples', 'lives', 'However', 'outdone', 'miraculous', 'portrayal', 'Elizabeth', 'First', 'production', 'film', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'created', 'skill', 'very', 'fine', 'painter', 'Most', 'films', 'done', 'about', 'historical', 'characters', 'personalities', 'bigger', 'then', 'life', 'are', 'often', 'lofty', 'almost', 'surreal', 'though', 'well', 'done', 'particular', 'film', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Elizabeth', 'really', 'focus', 'Elizabeth', 'woman', 'associates', 'life', 'Queen', 'England', 'being', 'just', 'human', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'having', 'problems', 'deciding', 'should', 'purchase', 'film', 'certainly', 'was', 'paying', 'very', 'close', 'attention', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'when', 'played', 'detective', 'public', 'television', 'do', 'believe', 'role', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'acting', 'career', 'will', 'should', 'enter', 'new', 'heights', 'character', 'acting', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'future']",Elizabeth I

Helen Mirren's portrait of Elizabeth Tudor from age 43 to her death at 69 is as deep and nuanced a performance as I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few actresses do Good Queen Bess (Glenda Jackson, Judi Dench, Bette Davis, et. al).  Jeremy Irons is fantastic as Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.  Hugh Dancy is impressive as Leicester's stepson Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, though for me it was a bit hard to accept a twentysomething Devereaux attempting to have sex with a fiftysomething Elizabeth after Leicester's death. Elizabeth in that stage of her life was so physically unattractive that I don't think  Devereaux would have tried such an approach in real life, but they both participated in the courtly-love rituals that was so much a part of Tudor court life.  The costumes and the sets are as close to authenic as they can possibly get.  One humorous note, though.  At the start of the film, when several characters are in a hallway, look closely at the candle behind them in a wall niche; it's actually an electric light with a yellow, flamed-shaped bulb!",5,"""Elizabeth I""",1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,1108,"['Excellent', 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'portrait', 'Elizabeth', 'Tudor', 'age', '43', 'death', '69', 'as', 'deep', 'nuanced', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'actresses', 'do', 'Good', 'Queen', 'Bess', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'et', 'al', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'fantastic', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'Earl', 'Leicester', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'impressive', 'Leicester', 'stepson', 'Robert', 'Devereaux', 'Earl', 'Essex', 'was', 'bit', 'hard', 'accept', 'twentysomething', 'Devereaux', 'attempting', 'have', 'sex', 'fiftysomething', 'Elizabeth', 'Leicester', 'death', 'Elizabeth', 'stage', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'physically', 'unattractive', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Devereaux', 'would', 'have', 'tried', 'approach', 'real', 'life', 'participated', 'courtly-love', 'rituals', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'Tudor', 'court', 'life', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'close', 'authenic', 'can', 'possibly', 'get', 'One', 'humorous', 'note', 'though', 'start', 'film', 'when', 'several', 'characters', 'are', 'hallway', 'look', 'closely', 'candle', 'wall', 'niche', 'actually', 'electric', 'light', 'yellow', 'flamed-shaped', 'bulb']",Elizabeth I

It seems that she portrayed every emotion a person could imagine to have, and did it with pinpoint accuracy, especially the more hysterical emotions. One wonders at her exhaustion upon the completion of the filming. She was in virtually every scene, and more and more we are hearing of actors collapsing when the demands of their assignments weigh them down.

This miniseries begins around the middle of Bess' rule, which is problematic as Mirren is clearly to old to portray the Queen at this point in her reign. Irons is solid as Robert Dudley, but lacking in charisma.  While the performances are good in spite of the miscasting the dialogue is to soap opera-ish, particularly the characterization of Elizabeth. While it is true that Elizabeth was loath to put Mary Stuart to death, owing to her belief in the divine appointment of sovereigns, this production has Bess as indecisive and emotional on most matters. This is highly unlikely to be the case in a monarch who ruled so long and successfully. Also the relationship between the Queen and the stepson of Dudley was overly romanticized, and Mary Stuart was portrayed too romatically. The Queen of Scots duplicity in attempts to usurp the English throne and return the country to the Roman Catholic fold are well established. Also the executions of the conspirators in the plot to kill Elizabeth are reminiscent of a bad horror movie. The largest failing however is the performance of Hugh Dancy as Robert Devereaux, who is wholly unconvincing and lacking in the charm the real Earl of Essex must have had to cause Elizabeth to tolerate his eccentricities so long.This is not to say the production is without merit. The costumes, sets and photography are excellent, and the cast does well with a mediocre screenplay. I always enjoy watching Mirren and Irons work, even on substandard material, and they do quite well given the limitations imposed by their being essentially too old for the early sections of the story. The score is appropriate to the period and lovely, but does little to enhance the drama. Still, the Masterpiece Theatre production, ""Elizabeth I: The Virgin Queen"", far outshines this one, and so this miniseries can only suffer by comparison.

992985,ABXBWSPM6YHAI,B000FO0AHO,"Rebecca Huston ""telynor""","[146, 149]","One of the things I love about owning a DVD player is that I get to watch movies pretty much as they were intended to be seen: in widescreen format, brilliant colour and sound, and the ability to pause them and have the frame actually stay still. This is especially nice when it's the sort of film I adore -- a costume drama with plenty of details and good looking actors.Thus is the case with Elizabeth I, a miniseries originally aired on HBO and now available as a two-disc set. Directed by Tom Hooper and written by Nigel Williams, this is a sumptuous treat of a film, full of glittering costumes, period sets and actors who speak and sound right for the time. Instead of showing the usual cradle-to-grave life of Elizabeth I of England, a different tactic is taken, showing her coping with several pivotal times in her reign, and how she dealt with the problem and moved on.The story opens after Elizabeth has been on the throne of England for about twenty years. She's now in her mid-forties, and her council of advisors are worried that because she has not married and given the country an heir, England stands a good chance of sliding back into civil war. Worse still, there's now the problem of religion -- most of England is Protestant, and most of the rest of Europe is Catholic, two factions that disagree with each other violently, and the only likely heir is the fanatically catholic Mary, Queen of Scots.Elizabeth (Helen Mirren) isn't about to marry, as we quickly see. She's got exactly what she wants in her relationship with Robert, the Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), down to the point where she has him alone in her private quarters, snuggling and cannoolding with a kiss and tickle or two. It's with her dear Robin that she can be who she wants to be, an animated, sexual woman, but she's also being pressured to marry and on the horizon is a visiting French prince, the Duc d'Anjou (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Covillault), a young charmer who is also a Catholic, and so, not quite suitable. Most of the first hour is taken up with sorting out this relationship, and we get to see how Elizabeth played the marriage game with such skill and ability.In fact, the viewer ought to resolve themselves to seeing what Elizabeth I did so well -- Elizabeth the Tease. She plays the game of flirtation, and love, and especially, the 'maybe, maybe' card. It doesn't matter if they are courtiers, her ladies in waiting, or the members of parliment. As we see so vividly, she doesn't quite trust anyone, not even her Secretary, Lord Burghley (Ian McDiarmid) or her spymaster, Walsingham (Patrick Malahide). In fact, Elizabeth wasn't above slapping and throwing tantrums when the mood took her, as we get to see. And in a court where she was the center of attention, anyone who tried to outshine her would be in for a world of hurt -- two examples are when a young lady is wearing a splendid gown, and another when a secret marriage comes to light.The next big problem in Elizabeth's life is the growing tension with the Spanish, and their backing of the exiled Mary of Scotland (Barbara Flynn), who has taken refuge in England after a successful rebellion in her native Scotland has thrown her out, and replaced her with her infant son. Elizabeth knows that if she Mary 'disposed' of, it will plunge England into war with a far more powerful Spain, and that's something that she can't afford. But she also is aware that Mary is more than eager to see Elizabeth die, and isn't above arranging it to happen. Even her trusted advisor, Walsingham wants her gone, and finally, Elizabeth gives in -- but doesn't want to know how it is done, or even when.It's this little bit that shows Elizabeth in all of her conniving, canny glory. It might seem particularly repellent in a leader, but the sixteenth century wasn't a nice, mannerly time -- it was the time of the smart and the strong, and a ruler had better be both in order to survive. But Mary isn't entirely stupid either, and her execution occurs pretty much as it had happened, with some pretty gory bits.Mary of Scotland's death leads into war with Spain and the Spanish Armada. Unfortunately, most of this happens off-screen, but we do get the famous speech at Tilburn, and I have to say that Mirren does it spectacularly well, and in a very convincing fashion. But triumph also has bitterness, as she loses her lover, Leicester to illness.Ten years pass, and a new generation has come to the queen's court. Among them is Leicester's stepson, the Earl of Essex (Hugh Dancy), another Robin, who isn't quite as smart as his predescessor was, but soon becomes Elizabeth's favorite. He charms, he seduces, and not everyone likes him. In fact, we see that Burghley's son, Cecil (Toby Jones) certainly is not. Cecil is smart, but is a misshapen dwarf that Elizabeth fondly calls ""Pygmy."" She too, has changed, her clothing becoming more sumptuous, hiding the ravages of time behind ever more layers of makeup and wigs.Essex is more of a toy than a companion, as we see, and Elizabeth can't seem to say no, even as things start to spiral out of control and Elizabeth discovers that there is one thing that she can't stop -- time and her own mortality.This is one amazing film. Despite the at times claustrophic feel of the sets and the fact that the crowd scenes seem to be a bit sparse, this is still a spectacle to watch. Mirren shines in this film, and don't be surprised to see her walk off with an award or two come January 15th. Besides Mirren, I appreciated that neither the characters of Leicester or d'Anjou were shown as lacking as they have been in other films about Elizabeth I. D'Anjou is particularly effective, being sympathetic, and knowing it is all a charade, and not the gibbering twit that we were treated to in the version with Cate Blanchett. Jeremy Irons is a sauve, polished courtier, not the sullen boy toy, and is very believable as Elizabeth's longtime confidant and friend.Some caveats. This film is not for the squeamish. There is one torture scene, several beheadings, one hand getting whacked off, and the rather more gruesome details of what is known as a traitor's death -- being hung, drawn and quartered. I'll spare you what that actually means, but it's a pretty messy sight. There are also two glaring historical errors in this as well: Elizabeth never met either Mary, Queen of Scots, nor James VI pf Scotland in her life. She certainly corresponded with them, but they never met in person.To balance the gory bits, there are two featurettes that are accessed through the special features. One is a 'making of' feature that goes into the casting, direction, locations and costumes for the series. The other is a rather nice little surprise that goes into the actual history of Elizabeth I and her political and personal relationships, presented by none other than David Starkey, a historian that I have come to like and admire. He also presents with what I have to say is the best description of the sex life of Elizabeth I that I have ever heard -- and no, you're going to have to sit and watch just like I did, because it is too good to miss.This is not a short program, coming in at about 220 minutes, shown in two parts. Worth it just for Helen Mirren alone, and the other actors are fine icing to the cake. Great for costume junkies, history fans, and anyone who wants to see a woman who set the world on its ear -- after all, that period of time is still known as the Elizabethan period, and it's easy to see why with this. My favorite so far in the various films about Elizabeth I.This scooped up a mountain of Emmys for 2006, including Best Miniseries, awards for production values and Bests for Mirren and Irons.Five very solid stars, and I would give it six if I could.",5,You too will believe that Mirren is Gloriana in this version.,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,7767,"['One', 'things', 'love', 'owning', 'DVD',

992987,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000FO0AHO,Robert J. Crawford,"[15, 15]","Elizabeth I is one of the most fascinating characters in history:  not only did she reside over Britain's rise as a world power (culture, political, and military) during the Reformation, but she was glaringly human in so many ways: she was lonely, frequently unable to make decisions, and vulnerable to handsome courtiers.  Mirren brings all of this out in this incredible reconstruction of her reign.  It begins in the middle of her reign, when she is well established in power, and ends with her death (and so is perfectly compatible with Elizabeth, the other wonderful film on her with the incomparable Cate Blanchett).  In between, there are many brilliant triumphs (beating the Spanish armada) and catastrophic mistakes (such as her execution of her trusted doctor, a Spanish Jew, based on the accusations of her later courtier beau, the Earl of Essex.  Through it all, Mirren helps us to see her as a real human being.  It is one of her greatest performances, and that is saying a lot.Irons is her first great (apparently unconsomatted) lover-courtier, Robert Dudley.  He is equally brilliant and portrayed as a better and far subtler politician than the one of Elizabeth (played wonderfully by Joseph Fiennes as a man dangerously out of his depth).  While this is an interpretation that is not necessarily the way he was viewed by his contemporaries, it fits with the plot, given his step son, the other Robert, the Earl of Essex, an insufferable dandy seducer.  Once the Earl of Essex takes his place, the drama is racheted up to a stunning and bizarre climax that I believe is extremely accurate historically and a frightening reflection on E I's weaknesses of character judgment.  But she suspected him all along - and this is no spoiler - yet needed him.  Both of these performances are utterly superb and believable.  THere is also the Duc d'Anjou, who is portrayed a bit too sympathically in my view as an apparently loving suitor (he was a cynical transvestite in the other film, which he was), though the doubt is always there as to his deepest motives and never resolved - just like real life.  Mary Queen of Scots is also wonderful, just as subtle so that a simplistic label cannot be stuck to her.  Was she a Catholic martyr?  Or a conspirator in treason?  Once again, as we cannot know, so is this film, these questions are never answered.  Other courtier-ministers are equally complex characters, from the ""pygmy"" to E I's master spy, Walsingham.This is perhaps the best HBO film I have ever seen.  There is much for history-buff pendants like me, and a wonderfully realised and intricate story.  It is simply brillaint and I will watch it many times again, to seek nuance and different interpretations.  That makes this a masterpiece, in my view.  Warmly recommended.  This is truly deep and informative drama.",5,"hauntingly dramatic, yet as historically accurate as a mini-series can be",1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,2831,"['Elizabeth', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'history', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'reside', 'Britain', 'rise', 'world', 'power', 'culture', 'political', 'military', 'Reformation', 'was', 'glaringly', 'human', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'lonely', 'frequently', 'unable', 'make', 'decisions', 'vulnerable', 'handsome', 'courtiers', 'Mirren', 'out', 'incredible', 'reconstruction', 'reign', 'middle', 'reign', 'when', 'well', 'established', 'power', 'death', 'so', 'perfectly', 'compatible', 'Elizabeth', 'other', 'wonderful', 'film', 'incomparable', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'are', 'many', 'brilliant', 'triumphs', 'beating', 'Spanish', 'armada', 'catastrophic', 'mistakes', 'such', 'execution', 'trusted', 'doctor', 'Spanish', 'Jew', 'based', 'accusations', 'later', 'courtier', 'beau', 'Earl', 'Essex', 'Mirren', 'see', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'saying', 'lot.Irons', 'first', 'great', 'apparently', 'unconsomatted', 'lover-courtier', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'portrayed', 'better', 'far', 'subtler', 'politician', 'one', 'Elizabeth', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'man', 'dangerously', 'depth', 'interpretation', 'not', 'necessarily', 'way', 'was', 'viewed', 'contemporaries', 'plot', 'given', 'step', 'son', 'other', 'Robert', 'Earl', 'Essex', 'insufferable', 'dandy', 'seducer', 'Earl', 'Essex', 'place', 'drama', 'racheted', 'up', 'stunning', 'bizarre', 'climax', 'believe', 'extremely', 'accurate', 'historically', 'frightening', 'reflection', 'E', 'weaknesses', 'character', 'judgment', 'suspected', 'spoiler', 'yet', 'needed', 'performances', 'are', 'utterly', 'superb', 'believable', 'also', 'Duc', ""d'Anjou"", 'who', 'portrayed', 'bit', 'too', 'sympathically', 'view', 'apparently', 'loving', 'suitor', 'was', 'cynical', 'transvestite', 'other', 'film', 'was', 'doubt', 'always', 'there', 'deepest', 'motives', 'never', 'resolved', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'also', 'wonderful', 'just', 'subtle', 'simplistic', 'label', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'stuck', 'Was', 'Catholic', 'martyr', 'conspirator', 'treason', 'Once', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'know', 'so', 'film', 'questions', 'are', 'never', 'answered', 'Other', 'courtier-ministers', 'are', 'equally', 'complex', 'characters', 'pygmy', 'E', 'master', 'spy', 'Walsingham.This', 'perhaps', 'best', 'HBO', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'much', 'history-buff', 'pendants', 'wonderfully', 'realised', 'intricate', 'story', 'simply', 'brillaint', 'will', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'again', 'seek', 'nuance', 'different', 'interpretations', 'masterpiece', 'view', 'Warmly', 'recommended', 'truly', 'deep', 'informative', 'drama']",Elizabeth I

Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 0]","Short and simple:If you liked the BBC production of ""Elizabeth R"" with Glenda Jackson, it may take you a while to warm up to Helen Mirren as Elizabeth. Give yourself a chance to do so because she (and the supporting cast) is fantastic.Like Glenda, she owns the part and gives us a vision of Elizabeth I as a very human, yet powerful monarch.Where Glenda's Elizabeth was VERY historical and came off as a strong and sometimes strict monarch, Helen's Elizabeth I is more approachable and softer, without losing any of the great monarch's strengths.The production is sumptuous, has amazing costumes and sets, brilliant acting, wonderful dialog, totally believable performances and fascinating characters.Jeremy Irons is amazing as Lord Dudley. His chemistry with Helen is palpable, very exciting to watch. These are great actors.We all know the story of Elizabeth, so no point in a synopsis. This production follows the history fairly closely, but focuses more on the human and day-to-day life of Elizabeth and less on the courtly experiences.For any Elizabeth I fan, this is a must have!Excellent overall but...****** WARNING *****Some of the scenes in this production are EXTREMELY GORY!If you like ""torture porn"" they'll be just the thing for you. But if you are more interested in history than ""blood and guts"", have your finger on the Fast Forward button of your remote. Fortunately, there's enough warning before a gore scene starts so you can jump ahead before being totally grossed out.I know that these events DID occur. So do horrific traffic accidents, and I don't want to see them either! It is enough to know THAT it happened, rather than WATCH it happen.So, if you are like me, have your remote handy. If you want to watch the gore, then sit back and enjoy, you won't be disappointed.Either way, give this one a try, it is very enjoyable and thought provoking, just what you would expect from the great Queen herself!",5,Excellent,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,1928,"['Short', 'simple', 'liked', 'BBC', 'production', 'Elizabeth', 'R', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'may', 'take', 'while', 'warm', 'up', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Elizabeth', 'Give', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fantastic.Like', 'Glenda', 'part', 'vision', 'Elizabeth', 'very', 'human', 'yet', 'powerful', 'monarch.Where', 'Glenda', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'VERY', 'historical', 'came', 'off', 'strong', 'sometimes', 'strict', 'monarch', 'Helen', 'Elizabeth', 'more', 'approachable', 'softer', 'losing', 'great', 'monarch', 'strengths.The', 'production', 'sumptuous', 'amazing', 'costumes', 'sets', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'dialog', 'totally', 'believable', 'performances', 'fascinating', 'characters.Jeremy', 'Irons', 'amazing', 'Lord', 'Dudley', 'chemistry', 'Helen', 'palpable', 'very', 'exciting', 'watch', 'are', 'great', 'know', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'so', 'point', 'synopsis', 'production', 'history', 'fairly', 'closely', 'more', 'human', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'Elizabeth', 'less', 'courtly', 'Elizabeth', 'fan', 'must', 'have', 'Excellent', 'overall', '******', 'WARNING', '*****Some', 'scenes', 'production', 'are', 'EXTREMELY', 'GORY', 'like', 'torture', 'porn', ""'ll"", 'be', 'just', 'thing', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'history', 'blood', 'guts', 'have', 'finger', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'button', 'remote', 'Fortunately', 'enough', 'warning', 'gore', 'scene', 'so', 'can', 'jump', 'ahead', 'being', 'totally', 'grossed', 'out.I', 'know', 'events', 'DID', 'occur', 'So', 'do', 'horrific', 'traffic', 'accidents', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'enough', 'know', 'happened', 'rather', 'WATCH', 'are', 'have', 'remote', 'handy', 'want', 'watch', 'gore', 'then', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Either', 'way', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'thought', 'provoking', 'just', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'great', 'Queen']",Elizabeth I

Elizabeth is my FAVORITE historical figure and I Love it when I find a show that does her justice!!Helen Mirren is a great Elizabeth. She captures everything from Elizabeth's confidence and intelligence to her frustration and pervasiveness so perfectly. I love her! I wasn't so sure about Jeremy Irons as Dudley, but after a couple of viewings his performance has grown on me.What is so great about this show is that it takes place during the last years of Elizabeth's reign, which means we see some of the events that made Elizabeth a legend (like the death of Mary, Queen of Scots and the defeat of the Spanish Armada).

Anyway, like I said, the film is very long and the older Elizabeth got the more scarier and creepier she started to look.
