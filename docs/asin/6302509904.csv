The children in this movie, six children from different countries staying in an abandoned church in London, don't look as eerie and seem to be confused rather than evil. The small town in the first movie is also a more interesting environment than the big city in this sequel.The acting is quite fair but the screenplay is far from as good as the one of the first movie. The cinematography is quite good, but this sequel should have been better, but it's not a bad movie, watch this if it is on TV but don't pay too much to see it. If you have seen neither of them, watch Village of the Damned, it's quite much better. I give this movie 6 points of 10.

316780,A16G4AMQQK9299,6302509904,Dr. Nocturna,"[0, 0]","Intelligence experiments of children being conducted by the United Nations roots out Paul, a quiet boy in England that shows signs of being an absolute genius. Like assembling different shaped pieces into a box in 37.5 seconds, whereas an adult might take 2-3 hours kind of genius. Ever more bizarre is the discovery of five other children around the world with identical test results as Paul's. Bizarre to the second power: all the children come from mothers who have no idea how they got pregnant in the first place, with one claiming to be a virgin prior to the mysterious bun in the oven manifesting. Agamogenesis, anyone? When the tykes convene in an old church, the standoff thus begins between mankind and... well... emotionless children with awesome mind control capabilities, creepy, glowing eyes when provoked and who are well overdue for a timeout. A not bad sequel to the superior ""Village of the Damned"" that seems to be not much more than a cut and dry extension of the previous story. I'll go as far to say that a couple of times, it just got plain dull (there really was no need for this film to be 12 minutes longer than the first). It also didn't help that the story was more impersonal than its predessessor, where conflicted families dealing with their unusual children added emotional attachment for the viewer.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I don't know that 1964's CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED is that much of a direct sequel to VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (Village of the Damned/Children of the Damned). It for sure departs from John Wyndham's novel,The Midwich Cuckoos, which was the source material for CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED. The cast is different; no George Sanders in sight. There's no mention made of events that took place in the first film. You can even argue that CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED is a reboot of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED.It's still a thoughtful MGM slice of horror. It starts with a pair of academics, a psychologist (Ian Hendry) from London University and a geneticist (Alan Badel), marveling at the mental prowess exhibited by a peculiar English boy named Paul. They're so astounded, in fact, that they attempt to investigate the lad and his background. And this is where the freaky bits begin to edge in. They learn that Paul's mother loathes him. She claims that she hadn't been touched, so how could the boy exist? She gets in a terrible accident and we can't help but glance accusingly at the boy. We'd all seen the first movie.The film introduces us to five other children, gathered from other parts of the globe. They're similarly gifted, all of them kind of creepy, they and Paul manifesting a telepathic accord and a hive awareness. Their frightening psychic powers send ripples up and down the international scientific community and the respective military organizations. And this is where this film really sets itself apart from the first film. The kids from VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED were adamantly malevolent, whereas it's trickier to figure out what these kids truly are. What happens in this follow-up should inspire debate focusing on what defines humanity and on murky morality versus proper accountability. The film isn't subtle about condemning man's ambition and paranoia and jingoism. Everyone wants to harness the children's abilities. Governing bodies jostle to see which of them could monopolize these unknown assets, these biological sports. But xenophobia plays a role. Use the children, or destroy them? One scientist asks, either cynically or pragmatically: ""And if they marry and propagate, whose grandchildren will inherit the Earth? Ours or theirs?"" We the movie viewers aren't certain what choices man's self-interest will compel him to make.It's not as unnerving as VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, maybe because the shock value's not as pronounced anymore. It doesn't convey the same spooky chills and sense of uneasiness. It doesn't have George Sanders. It's still a decent watch. See this for the allegorical tale that it is, the cautionary tale that it is. This is not how one should react when faced with the unknown. You got to keep track of that loose screwdriver.",3,"""Have you ever seen them laugh, run, play?

Kuczma ""RogueUlfric""","[4, 5]","Perhaps Children of the Damned would have been a lot more effective had it not been for the heightened expectations created by the original Village of the Damned.  By itself, it's not a bad little chiller, combining strong  elements of suspense, horror, some unintentional humor, and adequate  special effects.  The plot is a bit too predictable and the action too slow  in developing.  The action/horror sequences lack the surprise and  unpredictability of the earlier film, but are decent in their own right.  This is a perfect three-star effort, not too good, not too bad.  If you  really like modern variations of gothic horror, you'll enjoy Children of  the Damned.

Bernabo,"[1, 2]","Once you have seen ""Village of the Damned"" it is pretty much inevitable that you will check out ""Children of the Damned,"" although you will find it impossible to avoid being less impressed with the sequel. Written by John Briley (""Invasion Quartet"" and ""Ghandi""), this 1963 film makes more sense if you think of it as a re-imagining of John Wyndham's original concept. Instead of all these children being born in one place looking the same, this time we have children born all over the place who look different. They still stare and they still control your minds, but now they are not children from a damned village but children from around the world.Paul (Clive Powell) is from the United Kingdom, Mi Ling (Yoke-Moon Lee) is from China), Nina (Roberta Rex) is from the Soviet Union, Aga Nagolo (Gerald Delsol) is from an African nation, Rashid (Mahdu Mathen) is from India, and Mark (Frank Summerscale) is from the United States. So while there is East and West tensions here there is also a Third World element to the Cold War sub-text, although really it is each nation for itself because allies do not trust each other. Debating the pros and cons are Dr. David Neville (Alan Badle) and Colonel Tom Lewellin (Ian Hendry) while Paul stares in a manner that is either threatening or unthreatening depending on what you end up thinking about the children.Are these children still the progeny of alien visitors? Apparently not this time around, because although their births cannot be dismissed as mere coincidence, it could just as likely be that they are the result of mutation. At least I could make such a reading based on what happens in the film, which goes for a more of a sense of ambiguity regarding why the children are here: are they evil or our saviors? Good question. Just plan on looking into your own heart and mind to find the answer because the film wants to have it both ways (or as many different ways to explain what is going on as you can come up with here). In the end what this film most has in common with ""Village of the Damned"" is the conclusion.""Children of the Damned"" is not even close to being a great science fiction film, but if you could forget the inevitable comparisons to ""Village of the Damned"" it is at least interesting on its own terms and apparently much more worth watching that John Carpenter's remake of ""Village of the Damned"" from what I hear. Still, if what you are interested in is a science fiction film that functions as a Cold War allegory, skip this one and go directly to ""Invasion of the Body Snatches"" and ""The Thing From Another World."" If you want children who are damned, then just go back to the original.",3,Not really a sequel but a re-imagining of the Wyndham's damned children,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,2663,"['Once', 'have', 'seen', 'Village', 'Damned', 'pretty', 'much', 'inevitable', 'will', 'check', 'Children', 'Damned', 'will', 'find', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'being', 'less', 'impressed', 'sequel', 'Written', 'John', 'Briley', 'Invasion', 'Quartet', 'Ghandi', '1963', 'film', 'more', 'sense', 'think', 're-imagining', 'John', 'Wyndham', 'original', 'concept', 'Instead', 'children', 'being', 'born', 'one', 'place', 'looking', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'children', 'born', 'place', 'who', 'look', 'different', 'still', 'stare', 'still', 'control', 'minds', 'now', 'are', 'not', 'children', 'damned', 'village', 'children', 'world.Paul', 'Clive', 'Powell', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'Mi', 'Ling', 'Yoke-Moon', 'Lee', 'China', 'Nina', 'Roberta', 'Rex', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Aga', 'Nagolo', 'Gerald', 'Delsol', 'African', 'nation', 'Rashid', 'Mahdu', 'Mathen', 'India', 'Mark', 'Frank', 'Summerscale', 'United', 'States', 'So', 'East', 'West', 'tensions', 'here', 'also', 'Third', 'World', 'element', 'Cold', 'War', 'sub-text', 'really', 'nation', 'allies', 'do', 'not', 'trust', 'other', 'Debating', 'pros', 'cons', 'are', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Neville', 'Alan', 'Badle', 'Colonel', 'Tom', 'Lewellin', 'Ian', 'Hendry', 'Paul', 'manner', 'threatening', 'unthreatening', 'depending', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'thinking', 'children.Are', 'children', 'still', 'progeny', 'alien', 'visitors', 'Apparently', 'not', 'time', 'around', 'births', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'dismissed', 'mere', 'coincidence', 'could', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'be', 'are', 'result', 'mutation', 'least', 'could', 'make', 'such', 'reading', 'based', 'what', 'film', 'more', 'sense', 'ambiguity', 'regarding', 'why', 'children', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'evil', 'saviors', 'Good', 'question', 'Just', 'plan', 'looking', 'own', 'heart', 'mind', 'find', 'answer', 'film', 'have', 'ways', 'as', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'here', 'end', 'what', 'film', 'most', 'common', 'Village', 'Damned', 'conclusion', 'Children', 'Damned', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'could', 'forget', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'Village', 'Damned', 'least', 'interesting', 'own', 'terms', 'apparently', 'much', 'more', 'worth', 'watching', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'remake', 'Village', 'Damned', 'what', 'hear', 'Still', 'what', 'are', 'interested', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'functions', 'Cold', 'War', 'allegory', 'skip', 'one', 'go', 'directly', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatches', 'Thing', 'World', 'want', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'damned', 'then', 'just', 'go', 'back', 'original']",N/A
316784,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6302509904,Martin Asiner,"[6, 6]","There is the unfortunate but understandable tendency to judge the merits of THE CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED against its highly successful predecessor, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED.  In the latter, director Wolf Rilla created crackling suspense with the birth of a brood of telepathic blond children who are clearly the result of extraterrestrial intervention.  Their mission was to create more of their own kind; hence the mutually antagonistic Darwinian confrontation between them and humanity.  With the former, however, director Anton Leader shifts the focus from the why of the children to the how.  Several times, a human scientist asks the children, ""Why are you here?""  Each time, the reply is noncommital.  For the most part the children are eeriely silent, and it is only toward the end that they can verbalize, however imperfectly, their mission.  Just before the inevitable bloodbath, the children's spokesboy Paul notes: ""We are here for the same reason you are.""  This reply raises more questions than it answers since humanity is here only because as a species human beings have run roughshod over all competitors.This film is not meant to be a sequel to the earlier VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, despite the similar titles and storyline.  CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED is a stand alone film that is typical of the British thrillers of the mid 1960's.  The production is starkly filmed in harsh shades of black and white with an earnest cast that delivers considerable suspense, even if none of the actors is known to American viewers. Both films suggest that humanity is quite willing to meet all threats to its safety with a singlemindedess of purpose that is at least as fixed as any the children could produce.",3,The Children: We Are Here For the Same Reason You Are,1066608000,"10 20, 2003",2003,1702,"['unfortunate', 'understandable', 'tendency', 'judge', 'merits', 'THE', 'CHILDREN', 'THE', 'DAMNED', 'highly', 'successful', 'predecessor', 'VILLAGE', 'THE', 'DAMNED', 'latter', 'director', 'Wolf', 'Rilla', 'created', 'crackling', 'suspense', 'birth', 'brood', 'telepathic', 'blond', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'result', 'extraterrestrial', 'intervention', 'mission', 'was', 'create', 'more', 'own', 'kind', 'hence', 'mutually', 'antagonistic', 'Darwinian', 'confrontation', 'humanity', 'former', 'however', 'director', 'Anton', 'Leader', 'shifts', 'focus', 'why', 'children', 'how', 'Several', 'times', 'human', 'scientist', 'children', 'Why', 'are', 'here', 'time', 'reply', 'noncommital', 'most', 'part', 'children', 'are', 'eeriely', 'silent', 'only', 'end', 'can', 'verbalize', 'however', 'imperfectly', 'mission', 'Just', 'inevitable', 'bloodbath', 'children', 'spokesboy', 'Paul', 'notes', 'are', 'here', 'same', 'reason', 'are', 'reply', 'more', 'questions', 'humanity', 'here', 'only', 'species', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'run', 'roughshod', 'competitors.This', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'sequel', 'earlier', 'VILLAGE', 'THE', 'DAMNED', 'similar', 'titles', 'storyline', 'CHILDREN', 'THE', 'DAMNED', 'stand', 'alone', 'film', 'typical', 'British', 'thrillers', 'mid', '1960', 'production', 'starkly', 'filmed', 'harsh', 'shades', 'black', 'white', 'earnest', 'cast', 'considerable', 'suspense', 'even', 'none', 'actors', 'known', 'American', 'viewers', 'films', 'suggest', 'humanity', 'quite', 'willing', 'meet', 'threats', 'safety', 'singlemindedess', 'purpose', 'least', 'as', 'fixed', 'children', 'could', 'produce']",N/A
