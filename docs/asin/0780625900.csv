34682,A26A8T38C2GQD7,0780625900,Taheen Lopez,"[3, 4]","I don't see what's taking them so long to bring this CHiPs reunion movie out on DVD, especially since it was a popular TV movie that lots of people enjoyed watching including myself since it gave us a chance to see Ponch(Erik Estrada)and Jon(Larry Wilcox) reunite after 16 years from disolving their partnership since Wilcox left the show in the Spring of 1982 due to the fact that Wilcox and Estrada didn't get along in real life behind the set, plus it was interesting seeing how much everyone on the show had changed 15 years later after CHiPs cancellation on NBC along with the fact that the action was actually more upgraded and more realistic in this movie than it ever was during CHiPs whole 6-year run on NBC since Jon and Ponch and none of their fellow officers ever used their guns on the series, unlike most other cop shows like ADAM-12, DRAGNET, TJ HOOKER, HUNTER, etc.Unfortunately CHP mechanic Harlan Arliss(Lou Wagner) along with Officers Bonnie Clark(Randi Oakes), Jeb Turner(Michael Dorn), Sindy Cahill(Brianne Leary), or Kathy Linahan(Tina Gayle)were not in this CHiPs reunion movie although it would've been nice if they had been.Additionally, Jon & Ponch's superior officer Joe Getraer(Robert Pine)is now the CHP Commisioner, Jon is now Capt. Baker, Ponch's last partner in the last 3 episodes of CHiPs Bruce Nelson(Bruce Penhall)gets promoted to Sergeant, and Artie Grossman(Paul Linke)gets transferred to investigations, plus Ponch and Jon aren't bachelors anymore living the single life that they had lived on the show since they both settled down and got married since Ponch is now a widower with a kid and Jon is now married to a fellow CHP officer Sandy Baker.In addition, everything else in this movie is a lot more upgraded too like Ponch and Jon used BMW motorcycles instead of the Kawasaki bikes they used in the series, the CHP cruisers are obviously more sophisticated and more upgraded with better equipment, better lightbars since they used '97 and '98 Ford Crown Victoria CHP patrol cars instead of the '77 and '79 Dodge Monacos they used on the series and used the Vision brand lightbars that they still sometimes use today instead of using the squared flimsy looking lightbar they used on the series.Even though CHiPs '99 was quite an upgrade from CHiPs 1977-83 run on NBC, it's just too bad that Jon and Ponch didn't look nearly as good as they did on the series since Ponch is all chunky with gray hair instead of fit with black hair and Jon had wrinkles and grays, although Larry Wilcox didn't look bad for his age, despite the fact that Wilcox isn't young and wrinkle-free anymore.It was also cool seeing Ponch and Jon being shown on the show JUDGE JUDY just before Jon has a fallout with Ponch before Ponch and his partner get rescued by Jon at the end of this movie when Ponch and Jon make up and become friends again.The one thing I had a hard time understanding about CHiPs '99 is why did they decide to name this CHiPs reunion movie ""CHiPs '99"" instead of ""CHiPs '98"" or ""CHiPs 2000"", since CHiPs '99 made its debut on TNT in October of 1998, not in 1999 or the year 2000.Additionally, I found it odd how Jon was a captain all of the sudden in this movie since Jon had so-called left the CHP and moved back to his ranch in Wyoming in the 1982-83 Season when Officer Bobby Nelson(Tom Reilly)had replaced Jon Baker(Larry Wilcox)as Ponch's new partner in the 1982-83 Season of CHiPs, which by the way was the last and final season of CHiPs before declining ratings led to the shows cancellation in the Summer of 1983.But in this movie, Ponch and Jon act almost as if Jon never even left the CHP, yet Jon is a captain all of the sudden, but was only a patrolman throughout the first 5 years of his partnership with Ponch along with the fact that the California Highway Patrol requires anybody who wants to rejoin the CHP to go through the CHP Academy in Sacramento all over again, even if you're a former chippie, which would therefore mean that both Jon and Ponch had to go through the CHP academy all over again before they reunited at Central in the Fall of 1998.In addition to that, even though they used clips from episodes of the CHiPs series in this movie, including clips from CHiPs 6th Season like the ""Fast Company"" episode when Bruce Nelson becomes a sworn rookie California Highway Patrolman and becomes Ponch's new partner replacing Bruce's big brother/Ponch's previous partner Bobby Nelson, yet in this movie they don't even mention Bobby or even his name, even though Bruce was still in this movie and nearly dies in a motorcycle accident, but I guess the reason why they didn't have or even mention Bobby's name was because nobody really liked Bobby on the show along with the fact that Erik Estrada had a fallout with Tom Reilly since Estrada didn't like Reilly's  work ethic when Reilly got arrested by the CHP's rival(LAPD)for drug possession in early 1983 which resulted in Reilly getting replaced by Penhall as Ponch's new partner in April of 1983.However, Wilcox and Estrada were eventually able to patch up their differences and become friends later on after CHiPs cancellation on NBC, which was how they were able to manage having Estrada and Wilcox do this reunion movie even though Wilcox and Estrada had constant rivalry behind the set during the first 5 seasons of the show.",3,CHiPs 99 for DVD?,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,5344,"['do', ""n't"",
