I saw this originally on HBO years ago and their relationship just drew me in.  The two are so adorable together...it always brings a smile to my face when they talk abut each other.  It truly is a relationship of mutual respect and understanding.  If you're a fan of basketball for sure give this a try...I would say if you are a fan of documentaries in general give this a try!

IT IS NOT A HIGHLIGHT REEL. This is about how they are forever linked in so many ways. They are linked in a lot of ways by being polar opposites from each other on some things. Black and white, East and West, charismatic and awkwardly quiet, Boston and LA, among about a million other comparisons.  I saw this twice on HBO and I plan on buying it as soon as it comes out.Their story is pretty much storybook type material. No two players in NBA history have ever been forever linked as Larry Bird and Earvin Johnson. Only a few rivalries in sports history compare. As I said before, this is not a highlight reel. This is as indepth life and career overview that has been made about these two men. Being too that it is made by HBO, it gives it much more credibility than any other previous biographies about them.If you are a fan of sports in general I think you will enjoy this selection. If you are basketball fan, then this is a must have for your collection. Anyone will love Magic's infectious attitude about life and how emotional he is about himself and his friends and Bird's emotionless facial expressions as well as dry, ironic sense of humor that will have you rolling in the floor. Both of these men are equally likable but totally different personality wise. They were once bitter enemies and now are great friends that have a special connection and understanding only they can grasp.I wrote HBO to release this on DVD and they finally have and I'm so excited! I think anyone that watches this will see why after they view this gem!",5,For the Bird OR Magic Fan!,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,1646,"['videos', 'Bird', 'Magic', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'years', 'far', 'best', 'IT', 'NOT', 'A', 'HIGHLIGHT', 'REEL', 'how', 'are', 'forever', 'linked', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'linked', 'lot', 'ways', 'being', 'polar', 'opposites', 'other', 'things', 'Black', 'white', 'East', 'West', 'charismatic', 'awkwardly', 'quiet', 'Boston', 'LA', 'million', 'other', 'comparisons', 'saw', 'twice', 'HBO', 'plan', 'buying', 'as', 'soon', 'out.Their', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'storybook', 'type', 'material', 'two', 'players', 'NBA', 'history', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'forever', 'linked', 'Larry', 'Bird', 'Earvin', 'Johnson', 'Only', 'few', 'rivalries', 'sports', 'history', 'compare', 'said', 'before', 'not', 'highlight', 'reel', 'indepth', 'life', 'career', 'overview', 'been', 'made', 'two', 'men', 'Being', 'too', 'made', 'HBO', 'much', 'more', 'credibility', 'other', 'previous', 'biographies', 'them.If', 'are', 'fan', 'sports', 'general', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'selection', 'are', 'basketball', 'fan', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'collection', 'Anyone', 'will', 'love', 'Magic', 'infectious', 'attitude', 'life', 'how', 'emotional', 'friends', 'Bird', 'emotionless', 'facial', 'expressions', 'as', 'well', 'dry', 'ironic', 'sense', 'humor', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'floor', 'men', 'are', 'equally', 'likable', 'totally', 'different', 'personality', 'wise', 'were', 'once', 'bitter', 'enemies', 'now', 'are', 'great', 'friends', 'have', 'special', 'connection', 'understanding', 'only', 'can', 'grasp.I', 'wrote', 'HBO', 'release', 'DVD', 'finally', 'have', ""'m"", 'so', 'excited', 'think', 'anyone', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'view', 'gem']",N/A
