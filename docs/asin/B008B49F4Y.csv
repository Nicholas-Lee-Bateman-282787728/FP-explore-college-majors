The packaging does not mention this is only part 1 --- so you waste your time watching an average B movie that does not have the best acting but it is still interesting.  The movie leaves you hanging when it ends and says the next part is coming soon.  Kinda reminds me of the old serials that I used to see every saturday at the local theater and leaves you hanging until the next chapter.  Well I wasted $$$ buying this DVD and am going to cut my losses by not buying the next chapter.

I could actually see something like this happening now days.  Husband did not understand why the chip was so important till i explained a little more detail about it having to deal with the Mark of the Beast.  Other than that it was good.  THere was a little gore  but not so much that it was gross and yes they had guns....there had to be guns to make the movie more realistic for now days.  It you dont like action movies --you should avoid it --you can tell by the cover on the dvd that there will be some action.  I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12 due to subject matter and action and gun use.Can't wait to watch  The Mark 2.

The acting was ok, but it was obvious that some of the background was computer generated and as a result, looked really fake. It was a bit hard to get into the movie as a result.That being said, I have some issues with some of the plot lines. The main character gets implanted with the chip against his will and since he's the first successful human transplant, he's now a very valuable commodity. Now, going by the Bible here, I don't get how you can be implanted and not give up your soul in the process as the Bible teaches that once you receive that mark, your soul is gone. The movie never addresses that paradox.Overall, I'm not hanging about with baited breath for the next series.
