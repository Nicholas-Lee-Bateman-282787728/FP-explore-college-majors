In my personal opinion, dinosaur documentaries these days rely too much on advanced computer graphics technology. Some of the technology is fantastic, but the amount of learning is minimal at best. Most of the learning has to do with what the animal is doing on screen at that time. The T-Rex senses danger, the apatosaurus feeds, etc. Not really anything on the overall behaviors of the animals or why we think they behaved in that way.It is true that the documentaries on this DVD focus on the activities of paleontologists, but you absolutely HAVE to understand how these people work to understand where current hypotheses regarding dinosaurs originated. Otherwise, you are just watching a TV show. This type of in-depth learning is good for kids and I'd encourage parents to let their kids give programs like this a fair shot. Maybe they will want to be scientists one day. I know I did.",5,Pleasantly surprised.,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,1160,"['had', 'held', 'off', 'getting', 'DVD', 'here', 'have', 'said', 'quality', 'was', 'low', 'being', 'dinosaur', 'nut', 'documentary', 'collector', 'could', 'not', 'hold', 'off', 'long.These', 'programs', 'are', 'more', 'line', 'what', 'used', 'watch', 'young', 'aspiring', 'paleontologist', 'personal', 'opinion', 'dinosaur', 'documentaries', 'days', 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'advanced', 'computer', 'graphics', 'technology', 'technology', 'fantastic', 'amount', 'learning', 'minimal', 'best', 'Most', 'learning', 'do', 'what', 'animal', 'doing', 'screen', 'time', 'T-Rex', 'senses', 'danger', 'apatosaurus', 'feeds', 'etc', 'Not', 'really', 'anything', 'overall', 'behaviors', 'animals', 'why', 'think', 'behaved', 'way.It', 'true', 'documentaries', 'DVD', 'focus', 'activities', 'paleontologists', 'absolutely', 'HAVE', 'understand', 'how', 'people', 'work', 'understand', 'where', 'current', 'hypotheses', 'regarding', 'dinosaurs', 'originated', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'just', 'watching', 'TV', 'show', 'type', 'in-depth', 'learning', 'good', 'kids', ""'d"", 'encourage', 'parents', 'let', 'kids', 'give', 'programs', 'fair', 'shot', 'Maybe', 'will', 'want', 'be', 'scientists', 'one', 'day', 'know', 'did']",Dinosaurs - Inside and Out - 4 HOURS!

It also describes different views on the extinction of Dinosaurs, as well as new information on how some of them lived. I was also very surprised that it contained information on finds in Argentina! There is also some information on the Jurasic. Most videos concentrate on the Cretaceus, I don't know if it's due to lack of information or the popularity of T-Rex.
