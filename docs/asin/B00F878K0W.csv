Everything else here is obnoxious, meandering, and doesn't deliver in any dramatic way whatsoever.  Other than the 'horror' of drug use destroying lives (the film even manages to deliver this angle with apathetic blandness), there is nothing remotely frightening or suspenseful.  A disappointing affair that seems like someone found a couple of hours of themselves partying on their smartphone, wondered how they could use it for a movie, tacked on some vague voice over about the gates to hell in the last 15 minutes, and called it a horror film.  Obviously, if I watched it I'm willing to give indie movies a shot, but this was an awful 90 minutes.",1,"Unlikeable 20-something's do drugs for an agonizing 90 minutes of pure boredom.

The actors are definitely genuine. I felt like I had known some back in the day. I googled afterwards and read that some of them were not actors but were cast  because they embodied the character. By cast, I do not mean via a regular casting call but picked off the street. There are some hallucinatory scenes, surreal touches, which were very nice. The atmosphere is effectively creepy. The horror is more of  'a lurking fear' than an overt one. It is more arthouse than mainstream. If you are into that, then dial it up. If not, and are curious, you might like it too.",4,Horror Junkie's review: oops forgot this one; different in a good way,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,675,"['details', 'are', 'fuzzy', 'mind', 'watched', 'while', 'back', 'could', ""'ve"", 'sworn', 'reviewed', 'actors', 'are', 'definitely', 'genuine', 'felt', 'had', 'known', 'back', 'day', 'googled', 'afterwards', 'read', 'were', 'not', 'actors', 'were', 'cast', 'embodied', 'character', 'cast', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'regular', 'casting', 'call', 'picked', 'street', 'are', 'hallucinatory', 'scenes', 'surreal', 'touches', 'were', 'very', 'nice', 'atmosphere', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'horror', 'more', 'lurking', 'fear', 'overt', 'one', 'more', 'arthouse', 'mainstream', 'are', 'then', 'dial', 'up', 'not', 'are', 'curious', 'might', 'like', 'too']",Toad Road

It was suppose to have a Blair Witch element but nothing even close shows up. Just nothing.3. Sadly, lead actress dies from a drug overdose shortly after filming in which she enacts a similar role.Positives:1. Surprisingly good acting for individuals with no acting and this was their only film, but then the film really didn't require acting to distant from one's self.2. Accurate portrayal of those who use soft drugs to pass time and feel better about themselves, especially from a daily mundane existence.

1670616,A3PO1EUJGZEOVY,B00F878K0W,Robert T,"[3, 3]",I bought this movie cause it sounded good. Well all that was good about it was the acting. There really is no horror to it. It was about kids getting high mostly. The main man actor and the lead lady one evening take a trip to Toad Road which is suppose to contain the 7 gates of hell. And well something happens. I just wish I watched this on Netflix. It sure wasn't worth what i spent on it. Do your self a favor and pass on this movie.,2,Ehhh,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,438,"['bought', 'movie', 'cause', 'sounded', 'good', 'Well', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'acting', 'really', 'horror', 'was', 'kids', 'getting', 'high', 'mostly', 'main', 'man', 'actor', 'lead', 'lady', 'one', 'evening', 'take', 'trip', 'Toad', 'Road', 'suppose', 'contain', '7', 'gates', 'hell', 'well', 'something', 'happens', 'just', 'wish', 'watched', 'Netflix', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'what', 'i', 'spent', 'Do', 'self', 'favor', 'pass', 'movie']",Toad Road
