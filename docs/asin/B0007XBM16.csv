893262,A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ,B0007XBM16,Daniel W. Kelly,"[30, 32]","The cover of the DVD looks REALLY creepy. It's a scam. Hip Hop horror has become a genre, and this is a terrible attempt to go the zombie route. This is 80 minutes of one woman running away from people with no zombie makeup on, just making silly snarling faces and grunting noises--and each ""zombie"" has bright red blood splashed on its white t-shirt so you know it's been chowing down. In group shots, when the zombies rip store bought meat products out of victims' shirts, some of the actors are either smiling or laughing at how stupid they're acting. It's ridiculous. Oh yeah, the zombies talk every once in a while, too. and they tote guns. And they wield a whole lot of rubber meat cleavers, and you can clearly see them faking the blows of the blade. Storyline? Simply, this woman seems to work at a construction site, gets attacked by the zombies, all her co-workers die, she runs and runs and runs, runs through the woods, finally mentions that she's going to save her husband and get away, and then eventually ends up back at the construction site after being captured several times and tied up by the zombie gang then breaking free while some other unfortunate gets sliced up. this movie is bad.

893266,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B0007XBM16,Joshua Koppel,"[5, 5]","I bought this one because I saw the trailer and it looked good.  Unfortunately the trailer contained the only good scene in the movie.  The movie starts with definitions of zombie so that we get the idea that traditional zombies aren't really dead.  Our first view of them is when two zombies wielding a cleaver and a sickle attack a guy at a shipping yard that is twenty miles from the nearest working plumbing (or so the captions says, believe it or not).  We then follow the plight of a young woman who works at the yard (which is in an industrial area and has a bus stop out front).  She is attacked and runs away to her apartment with her husband.  The zombies follow her and abduct them.  She wakes at the shipping yard and escapes.Now it gets even stranger.  She runs away and winds up in the woods beyond some really high mountains.  She is chased by more zombies who happen to be running around in the woods.  She returns to the shipping yard where she tries to rescue her husband (she was looking for him in the woods).  Then the plot falls completely apart until the end.  Each phase of the story starts out with more definitions that I guess are supposed to help us understand the main character better.These zombies use weapons and some of them talk.  The effects are ridiculous at best.  The opening zombie attack has the victim hid a dozen times by the cleaver and the sickle and yet there is no blood or wounding and he keeps fighting back and yelling even though he should be in little pieces.  We don't really know who the zombie master is or why he is doing what he is doing.  We don't know why everything seems to happen at the shipping yard or why the woman keeps going back there (except the time she is looking for her husband).  The geography of the movie makes no sense.  The plot makes no sense.  The appearance of the zombies at every turn makes no sense.  Production values are almost nonexistent.  The only high point was when a big zombie asks a naked woman with a hole in her belly why she won't just die (and if that is the high point you know how bad the rest must be).

Films like House Of The Dead, Dead Heist, Night Of The Living Dead 3-D, Return Of The Living Dead 4 & 5, Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium and Day Of The Dead Remake. But this is really the worst one I've ever seen. I thought Uwe Boll was a hack director. But ZWS is one HELL of a bad director.I've seen little kids did way much better with their home movies with their toys and imagination then this grown hack with his toys and his imagination. And I do mean toys.The cover is very misleading. The zombies look like walking corpses on the cover. Instead, they're really humans who walk like that have bad hemeriods. The carry plastic sickles and butcher knives you can get for $3.99 at any store. The laugh, they play stupid jokes, act like humans and talk like humans.You can easily tell that the gore looks like sausages, hot dogs and other types of food. There's even a scene where the film's heroine throws a motolov cocktail at the zombies, and their bodies are not on fire. All you see is smoke made from dried ice and the bodies look clean.The acting is horrible, even for a grade ""F-"" film. The DP work is pure garbage. The film score is really annoying and horrible. All I can say is that you can drink 10,000 cans of beer and you won't find no good in this film. Even with some really bad films out there, you can find something good in it.

893269,AKNIVZXNOIO1A,B0007XBM16,"Trashcan Ninja ""kinggojira""","[5, 5]","It can be if it's a movie called Zombiez...To call it the worst movie I've ever seen is too good for it. That would be saying that it's a movie in some sense, and I can't justifiably do that. What it most resembles are the stories that kids make up in those last years of elementary school-- you know the ones-- those last years that their imagination is still active and the real world hasn't corrupted their tender minds. This movie has a repetitive, improvised ""story"" style that is very much similar to children at play.The ""plot"" revolves around Josephine who basically runs from ""zombies"" for 85 minutes. Yeah. That's the plot. No, I am not kidding you. Anything else that happens to pop up in the story is purely coincidental. It does not add to nor take away from the previously mentioned ""plot"" of Josephine running from zombies.Now... by ""zombie"" I don't mean the guys you see on the awesome looking cover.... heavens, no.  These zombies are a bunch of happy smiling and/or grunting guys that look like the guys you might see sitting by the drink machine outside Piggly Wiggly on any given day. And no: They never realy look much different than that. They sometimes have blood on their faces that looks a lot like that red sweet and sour sauce I get at the china buffet, but that's about all the makeup effects that really happen in the movie. And in just a few brief moments of viewing the ""film"" you'll notice that there are actually more happy zombies in this movie than the rotten, mindless kind you find in most zombie flicks.Now, as far as ""special effects;"" well... the movie... kind of doesn't really have any. Yeah.  Well... Ok. There is this one scene where Josephine makes a Molitov Cocktail and throws it at the zombies.Well... who knew Molitov Cocktails created smoke but no fire? Crazay! It seemed to burn the zombies anyway, so who cares, right?But by far the real concern of the film was obviously the thing the director focused on more than anything else: Josephine's butt. I'd say a good 65 minutes of the 85 minute long movie the screen was filled with Josephine's ample bottom. It was like some reverse nightmare. Death by getting too much of a good thing.This movie is a blacksploitation movie made by black people. I have no doubt that the KKK bought the bulk of the production run of this movie to spread their assumption that African Americans are obsessed with big butts and fried chicken. I say the fried chicken part because of one scene near the end of the movie that makes absolutely no sense.... at all.... and that's saying something when that pops up as a significant point in a turdfest of a film like this....I give this -65 stars.But, man... It is definately worth buying, if just to own a copy of something so uniquely horrible.  I got it as a Christmas gift this year, and honestly it is one of the most treasured items I own.  No, I haven't watched it over and over again since I got it.  I actually only saw it once.  But I stick by my point that owning something like this is an honor.

893271,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B0007XBM16,Zombob,"[2, 2]","I am speechless after viewing this one, so let's get right to the review...1) ACTING: The acting really wasn't all THAT bad. There were a few individuals that could have taken a few more acting classes, but no one was REALLY bad. The lead actress was very good.2) PRODUCTION: Amazingly enough, I found the production values on this surprisingly good...to a point. Just an observation, but it makes me wonder if this movie was actually shot in order with the script. As the movie progresses, the production values started to suffer. Shots that were properly lit and focused and very tight, now have gone down in quality. Near the end of the movie, there was nary a drop of blood to be seen, even though people were stilled being killed off. It made me think that since the budget for the movie was going down, so was everything else. So, when the producers got to the ending scenes of the movie, it appeared that money had run out and they were making do with what they had. While I'm sure that many movies suffer from this, sadly, it was painfully noticable. And the soundtrack, while it was not the latest hip-hop songs I had thought it might be, (and it wasn't heavy metal music. YAY!) it seemed like someone sat down at a music machine, recording a few tracks sounding like ""an urban beat,"" and palyed it over and OVER AND OVER. And my only real continuity gripe was the heroine seemed to forget when her ankle was sprained / broken except when the scence called for it.3) SPECIAL EFFECTS: Very disappointing. I know low budget movies have to improvise and make do, but...it just gets very old and repetitive when a zombie reaches UNDER my shirt to kill me and pulls out my guts (which consisted of a bag of leftovers from the local butcher shop) time and time again. A zombie's make up consisted of having some blood on its face and having some blood / dirt on its shirt. And the weapons that the zombies used must have been gotten from the local Halloween store. Plastic knives, cleavers, swords...at LEAST for the close ups, real ones should've been used.4) ZOMBIES / ZOMBIEZ: This was the biggest let down of all. The zombies in this movie are not zombies at all. They are more like psychopaths with cannibalistic traits on the loose. They use weapons, they talk, they taunt their victims, they run away from the police, they follow the words of their leader, they torture people. This movie should've been called ""PsychoZ"" or ""CannibalZ,"" not ""ZombieZ.""5) THE CAUSE: It was over an hour before any revelation was made as to what exactly was going on in this movie, relating to all these people being killed, and to why the zombies were attacking. Which still didn't really explain HOW the zombies came to be...6) NUDITY: One brief scene of a totally nude female victim laying on a table.7) SPECIAL INTEREST: I will not even begin to explain the guy dressed up as a giant yellow chicken.Avoid this one. This one isn't worthy of a rental. If it was on the sci-fi channel, I would turn the t.v. off. Seriously. I would rather watch Day of the Dead 2: Contagium again.
