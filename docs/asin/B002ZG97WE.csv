The trend may be motivated because the producers save some money rather than hiring real actors. Unfortunately the results more often than not, are poorly acted movies, repulsive rather than funny situations, and feeling that strong desire to leave the theater, (or just turn off the TV if you watch at home) in just the first 10 minutes after the movie started. This movie is just one of those, with the difference that instead of 10 minutes you only need 5 to reach that point.Jack Black may be funny (to some people) as stand-up comedian, but as a movie actor he is really really really bad.In this movie he uses his body to try to make people laugh, but I could tell that most people watching, did not. With so many better actors available in Hollywood, maybe this movie could have been saved from doom, had the casting crew have done a better job by selecting a real actor for the main character.Bottom line: Unless you are the devil, and enjoy human pain, avoid this movie at all cost.

1303940,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG97WE,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 7]","I could be a prude and talk about how modernizing ""Gulliver's Travels"" is an affront to Jonathan Swift's novel and to the imagination in general, or I could admit that I was amused by some of what I saw. To say that I liked this movie would be an overstatement, but it does have its redeeming qualities, and by the end, it was obvious that the film wasn't the God awful experience I had read about and had been expecting. It stars and was executive produced by Jack Black, who plays Lemuel Gulliver as a modern day mailroom clerk for a New York newspaper, a position he has held for ten years. For some time, he has had a crush on the travel editor, Darcy (Amanda Peet), although he has always lacked the nerve to ask her out; hoping to impress her, he plagiarizes sections of vacation guides and passes himself off as a travel writer.She's impressed by his work, and lo and behold, she gives him an assignment: Sail into the middle of the Bermuda Triangle and write a piece debunking the myth that ships disappear there due to extraterrestrial activity. It's off the grid, she warns, and it will require him to be in a boat for three weeks. Gulliver assures her that it isn't a problem at all, that he's an avid boat-man. The next thing we know, he has fallen asleep at the helm, the GPS system has failed, and he's engulfed in a raging storm, one that results in an unnatural waterspout stretching high into the clouds. After being sucked into the towering vortex, Gulliver comes to on a shoreline; his body is restrained by ropes staked to the ground, and tiny people - no bigger than four inches, I'd say - are crawling all over him, thinking he's some kind of evil beast.Gulliver is now in the kingdom of Lilliput, and judging by the period costumes and the occasion use of Arthurian language, it's a land that time forgot. Although Gulliver is initially treated as forced labor, he wins over the people by saving the life of King Theodore (Billy Connolly). How does he do this? I don't think I should say. I run the risk of (a) ruining the moment for those who may actually find it funny, or (b) disgusting the readers and forever turning them away from the film. I'll say this much: Jonathan Swift had absolutely nothing to do with it.At this point, Gulliver has become the savior of the Lilliputians, who, as it turns out, are skilled builders. In record time, they construct a house big enough for him to live in. This is revealed in a clever shot; we see miniature construction workers toiling away on scaffolding, and as the camera pans upward, it's revealed that they're constructing a coffee maker. This home contains a theater, and it's there that Gulliver has Lilliputians reenact scenes from movies. He, of course, passes them off as events in his own life - they are amazed to learn that he fought Darth Vader, learned that Vader was his father, and, after shouting, ""I'm the king of the world!"" actually died during the sinking of the ""Titanic."" He also tells them that he's the President of the United States, that Yoda is Vice President, and that he misses the Millennium Falcon.The emotional center of the story is Gulliver's friendship with a Lilliputian named Horatio (Jason Siegel), and although he's a lowly commoner, I was surprised at just how much I liked him. He has feelings for the lovely Princess Mary (Emily Blunt), but she can't reciprocate, for she's betrothed to General Edward (Chris O'Dowd), who, for the sake of the kingdom, must maintain his reputation and his honor. Edward is an arrogant, jealous fool who wants to possess Mary and hates Gulliver for no reason other than the fact that he exists. Although he's the primary antagonist, he's also the film's main source of comedy; we delight as we watch him fail miserably at courting Mary and protesting Gulliver's influence on the people of Lilliput. The latter includes T-shirts, shorts, and a complete transformation of the town center into a Times Square recreation, the neon Broadway posters altered to prominently feature Gulliver's face. Somehow, I just don't see him as Elphaba or the Phantom of the Opera.I neglected to mention that ""Gulliver's Travels"" is in 3D, but considering how inundated we are with movies in that format, it probably wouldn't have made a difference. Although it's being advertised as a family comedy, it was really made for younger audiences in the transition phase from mindlessly innocent to awkward and rebellious. It may not please fans of Jack Black's raunchier comedies, although it does have a few well placed immature scenes.

1303942,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG97WE,C. Sawin,"[7, 11]","Jack Black is one of those actors/musicians that you either like somewhat or hate with a passion. There really is no middle ground. For me, Jack Black the actor will best be known for Be Kind Rewind, the Kung Fu Panda films, Saving Silverman, and High Fidelity while Jack Black the musician kind of lost his mojo after the first Tenacious D record (which is still a favorite amongst friends). Truth be told, Black seems to be at his best when he's not confined to the limits of family entertainment or at least has some room to stretch in a PG-13 environment. Gulliver's Travels actually feels like a Jack Black movie despite its family friendly rating, but that still can't save the fact that it's a fairly horrid experience overall.Gulliver (Black) works in the mail room and comes to the realization that he's not going anywhere in life. He finds himself on the way to The Bermuda Triangle after informing the office travel editor, Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet), that he's this supremely gifted (plagiarized) writer. On his journey there, Gulliver wakes up on the island of Liliput which is filled with nothing but tiny people. As a giant amongst mere men, Gulliver sees this as a chance to start over and be the ""big man"" for once. He soon learns that the size of a person isn't always an accurate portrayal of how big they really are.For a movie being marketed towards children, it was kind of shocking what actually made it into the film. There's an entire conversation centered on the term, ""lame ass,"" which is blurted several times throughout the entire two minute conversation. Can you remember the last time Mickey Mouse called Donald Duck a ""dumb ass?"" I sure can't (that ""South Park"" episode doesn't count). After a fire breaks out in Liliput, Gulliver thinks on his feet er...with his groin and puts out the fire by urinating on it as well as a handful of tiny people in the process. When all else fails, when you have a problem you're having a difficult time resolving, just piss on it as well as everyone around you. That's pretty much what you'll take away from the segment. And did they really squeeze the phrase, ""skeet skeet,"" into a family movie? Really?! That's pretty insane. What's even more ludicrous is what the film followed that part of the conversation up with; ""ship happens."" It sure does, Gulliver. It sure does.You can probably accept the way the movie begins; mostly because it actually looks and feels like the way Jack Black wakes up every morning. Walking around without pants on, re-enacting Star Wars with action figures, and mixing coffee and creamer in the filter to make coffee all seem like something the Jack Black people have gone to see on-screen the past fifteen years would do. That's kind of the only good thing about Gulliver's Travels. It does feel like it's Jack Black approved and authenticated by the man himself, which it probably was since he also produced it. The movie is based on the Jonathan Swift novel of the same name, which was written in 1726. But the movie gives no on-screen credit to the novel and that should be the first sign that you should probably abandon ship before you even board.The bottom line is Gulliver's Travels isn't funny. Not even a little bit. It's just toilet humor and expensive special effects colliding together while Jack Black shoves his goofy antics down your throat. The guy passes out after he falls on his backside, which is honestly something I've never seen before this movie. While Black does look to be having fun in the role, it just doesn't translate very well. These tiny people build Gulliver a life size home in less than seven days, which doesn't seem very logical. Forcing Horatio (Jason Segel) to recite Prince's ""Kiss"" while trying to woo Princess Mary (Emily Blunt) probably should've been more entertaining than it was. Jack Black can sing. He has the talent and the ability, but he's one of those performers that's better heard rather than seen. Him singing ""War"" at the end of the movie really should've just played over the credits rather than be an in-movie, choreographed with tiny people music video. Was Emily Blunt being awful on purpose? She was just horrendous at times. Plus she dropped out of Iron Man 2 for this? Somebody explain that to me.Gulliver's Travels is more than likely just as bad as the unfortunate soul that actually sat through it told you it was, if not worse. Jack Black does try to carry the film the best that he can, but it all crumbles once he literally and figuratively urinates all over everything. Throw in a giant robot and Black's butt crack and it's immediately labeled as something you should probably never sit through. Ever. Although featuring some well done special effects, any little bit of good Gulliver's Travels once had is massively outweighed by bad acting, weak story points, and humor that's more disgusting than it needs to be.",1,Ship really does happen...,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,4891,"['Jack', 'Black', 'one', 'actors/musicians', 'either', 'somewhat', 'hate', 'passion', 'really', 'middle', 'ground',

With this movie, if you can even call this a movie, Fox has become a degenerate studio catering to drooling imbeciles with any lack of taste for films in general.Before I review this film in proper, let me list down Fox's 'achievements' for 2010:1. John Davis. Enough said. This so-called 'uber-producer' who produces schlock for 20th Century Fox and its incumbent incompetent chairman, Tom Rothman, is no Jerry Bruckheimer or Brian Grazer. Look at his list of crapfest. Garfield? Dr Dolittle? Marmaduke? Norbit? Daddy Day Camp? And now this? He must be the king of talking animal flicks and that includes Jack Black. Can someone please stop him from producing anymore nonsensical rubbish?2. Tom Rothman. The man responsible for micromanaging and mismanaging every single Fox misfire this year. Stipulating all films to run under 2 hours? Prince Caspian was a masterpiece at 140 minutes and Dawn Treader sunk under its light weight at 110 minutes. Same goes for X3. Whatever happened to the 131 minute of a superhero epic we got for X2? Changing the title of 'Knight and Day'? And now a marketing executive takes the blame for the film's underwhelming box office returns? Real smooth, Tom, real smooth. Way to go for being a great helmsman in charge.3. Every flick that 20th Century Fox put out somehow fizzled at the box office. A-Team, Knight and Day, Marmaduke, Wall Street, Percy Jackson. Not a good lineup considering that the studio is celebrating its 75th anniversary. Not one classic. In comparison, look at Paramount's 1987's lineup for its 75th Anniversary. The Untouchables, Planes Trains and Automobiles, Fatal Attraction, Beverly Hills Cop 2. Now, this is the way to go!I digress. Now back to Gulliver's Travels. The biggest problem with this flick is that everything about it is cringe-worthy. 'Gavatar'? 'Homages' to practically all successful Fox movies? This is pure shameless self-promotion and self-aggrandizement I have ever seen. If this is a contemporary update of Swift's classic novel, it has failed utterly and miserably.Jack Black's ego is the problem here. He's still acting as a good-for-nothing slacker who plays rock music all day long. Basically, he's a momma's boy who has yet to grow up. Trying to play off his 'School of Rock' persona, I guess he wants to cater to the young. I mean, the breakout into the rock number at the end of the film, serves as an embarrassing reminder that Black needs to find an exit fast.Emily Blunt is being reduced to nothing more than a pea-brained princess whose intelligence rivals that of Hugh Laurie's 'Prince mini-brain' in the Blackadder series. What a disappointing turn from a hugely talented actress.Jason Segal is still holding on to a job?All in all, a really awful cinematic experience. Extremely forgettable.

In an attempt to impress her, he makes liberal use of the Cut/Paste PC function to put together sample articles, which then win him an assignment in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle.  This in turn lands him in a mysterious land far from NYC (but with cell access) in which he's the biggest person, in fact downright gargantuan.  (If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the first half hour in a nutshell.)He's landed in the land of the Lilliputians, who may be little but can build anything and apparently, have full access to modern technological devices.  At first, they hold him hostage, later he wins their undying gratitude by doing something that will be absolutely hysterical to anyone under the age of 10.  This part bears a slight resemblance to the eponymous book by Jonathan Swift, but otherwise, many liberties have been taken with the plot.

Max Gooding,"[6, 9]","This latest movie on Gulliver's Travels, which is based on a novel written by Jonathan Swift, an Irish writer and clergyman in the early 1700s, has a new twist to it and is set in more contemporary times.While the original book had several aspects to it, as listed below:[1] Adventure at rival countries of Lilliput and Blefuscu.[2] Adventure at Brobdingnag.[3] The Flying Island - Laputa[4] Empress Muodi's Estate[5] Glubbdubdrib - the magician's dwelling[6] Struldburgs - immortals with blindness[7] Houyhnhnms / YahoosThis film only touches on the first, and a bit of the second adventure aspects of the novel.However, it is still a delightful PG-rated movie. Rather than just being a storm that causes Gulliver's adventures, the Bermuda Triangle is brought into the mix, which is pretty cool.Also this film has some charming romantic aspects to it, firstly between Gulliver (Jack Black) and his co-worker Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet) and secondly on a smaller scale, between Horatio (Jason Segel) and Princess Mary (Emily Blunt).A lot has been thrown into the pot in making this movie, and these elements make the movie unusual and enjoyable. For the main battle, the army of Blefuscu, with the help of General Edward (Chris O'Dowd) of Lilliput, constructs a massive robot, that has some 'transformer' type capabilities to fight Gulliver. This was quite imaginative of the writers. Also throughout the movie, Guilliver 'pirates' ideas from other movies, and this also lends itself to some humor.",4,Gulliver's Twist,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,1500,"['latest', 'movie', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', 'based', 'novel', 'written', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'Irish', 'writer', 'clergyman', 'early', '1700s', 'new', 'twist', 'set', 'more', 'contemporary', 'original', 'book', 'had', 'several', 'aspects', 'listed', '[', '1', ']', 'Adventure', 'rival', 'countries', 'Lilliput', 'Blefuscu', '2', ']', 'Adventure', 'Brobdingnag', '3', 'Flying', 'Island', 'Laputa', '4', ']', 'Empress', 'Muodi', 'Estate', '[', '5', ']', 'Glubbdubdrib', 'magician', 'dwelling', '6', ']', 'Struldburgs', 'immortals', 'blindness', '7', ']', 'Houyhnhnms', '/', 'YahoosThis', 'film', 'only', 'first', 'bit', 'second', 'adventure', 'aspects', 'novel.However', 'still', 'delightful', 'PG-rated', 'movie', 'Rather', 'just', 'being', 'storm', 'Gulliver', 'adventures', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'brought', 'mix', 'pretty', 'cool.Also', 'film', 'charming', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'firstly', 'Gulliver', 'Jack', 'Black', 'co-worker', 'Darcy', 'Silverman', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'secondly', 'smaller', 'scale', 'Horatio', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Princess', 'Mary', 'Emily', 'Blunt', '.A', 'lot', 'been', 'thrown', 'pot', 'making', 'movie', 'elements', 'make', 'movie', 'unusual', 'enjoyable', 'main', 'battle', 'army', 'Blefuscu', 'help', 'General', 'Edward', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'Lilliput', 'massive', 'robot', ""'transformer"", 'type', 'capabilities', 'fight', 'Gulliver', 'was', 'quite', 'imaginative', 'writers', 'Also', 'movie', 'Guilliver', 'ideas', 'other', 'movies', 'also', 'humor']",N/A

1303959,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B002ZG97WE,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[5, 7]","***This review may contain spoilers***First of all, in response to Swiftian purists who were disappointed that Jack Black's version of ""Gulliver's Travels"" (hereafter GT) was not strictly faithful to Swift's ageless satire, I say, are you hopelessly naive?  In spite of its fantastic locales and characters, GT really doesn't lend itself to cinematic treatment because of its episodic structure and laceratingly pessimistic satire of human nature.  As Hallmark proved, GT is more suited to a mini-series approach, and while, I believe, Hallmark's GT (starring Ted Danson as Lemuel Gulliver) is the best (and probably the only) faithful adaptation of Swift's satire we will ever witness, even it had a contrived upbeat ending antithetical to Swift's themes.  As movies go, I think a somewhat whimsical (albeit somewhat superficial) fairy-tale approach is the best way to deal with GT.  Just about every GT movie version (animated or live action) does so, and I have enjoyed them all.  That goes for Jack Black's ""GT"" too, which is about on a par with the others.(PLOT DESCRIPTION:  Lemuel Gulliver (Jack Black), a boisterous, but surprisingly shy, mail-room clerk for a New York travel company, can't seem to advance professionally or romantically.  He has harbored a 5-year crush on Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet) without acting on it.  Gathering his courage one more time to ask Darcy out, he loses his nerve and instead pretends to be a noted travel writer looking for a better job.  After Gulliver fabricates a plagiarized travel article on Mexico, Darcy gives him a Bermuda Triangle assignment. Gulliver goes to Burmuda, charters a sailboat, gets sucked into a watery maelstrom, and finds himself bound on the ground in Lilliput, a miniature kingdom of doll-sized people.  At first their chained slave, Lemuel gains freedom and respect after saving the tiny princess (Emily Blunt) from a palace fire with his - excretions and the whole kingdom from an armada sent by Lilliput's enemy, the equally tiny kingdom of Blefescu. Lilliput celebrates the ""giant"" Gulliver as a hero and protector, all except the treacherous and jealous Lilliputian general Edward Eduardo (Chris O'Dowd), who schemes to take over Lilliput (and treasonously orchestrated the fire and armada attack) and resents the intrusion of the ""big, hairy beast"".Feeling like a ""big shot"" for the first time in his life, Gulliver gets the royal treatment from the industrious and tech-savvy Lilliputians, who amazingly build him a seaside home, theater, and even miniature Times Square mockup, and cater to his every need.  In the meantime, Gulliver regales the tiny folk with tall tales of his exploits, cribbing from ""Star Wars"", ""Titanic"", and other movies.  But the facade quickly crumbles as Gulliver receives voicemail messages from Darcy, who has realized Gulliver's deception and threatens to fire him.  Even worse, General Eduardo constructs a 7-foot metal robot (from a blueprint Lemuel accidentally brings with him) that humiliates, defeats, and exiles Gulliver to ""the forbidden land"", which turns out to be Brobdingnag, land of the giants (not named in the film).  For a while, the demoralized Gulliver becomes the plaything of a sadistic little girl until the heroic Lilliputian Horatio (Jason Segel), Gulliver's best friend in Lilliput, finds him and convinces him to come back to save the kingdom.  In the meantime, Darcy, who has set out to perform Gulliver's assignment, is also caught in the whirlpool and whisked to Lilliput, where she is also made prisoner.  Gulliver finds her in the dungeon he used to occupy, along with the king (Billy Connolly), queen (Catherine Tate), and the rest of the royal retinue, frees them, and vows to save Lilliput from the usurper Eduardo and his Iron-Man like robot. With Horatio's help, Gulliver does defeat Eduardo and the robot and save the kingdom, and wins Darcy's love and a real job as travel writer.  Also, Horatio finally overcomes his ""base"" origins and wins the princess's love.  Gulliver and Darcy go back to New York. Whew!)Now I'll admit that ""GT"" is far from a seamlessly perfect movie.  It contains improbabilities and plot holes a Brobdingnagian could walk through (e.g. how did the medieval Lilliputians acquire enough resources and technological know-how to feed and house Gulliver?; why didn't Gulliver trample any Lilliputians with all his jumping around; why didn't the Blefuscudian cannons wound Gulliver like a pistol?, how did Horatio make it safely to Brobdingnag to save Gulliver?; how could Gulliver's phone have enough bars to receive Darcy's call?).  The special effects and CGI were also wildly variable, from stunning to background projection phony.  And no, ""GT"" does not address Swift's satirical themes at all.  In spite of these shortcomings, I did enjoy the movie.I guess Jack Black's Gulliver insidiously won me over.  Sure, he's a chubby, fun-loving, energetic goof, but he is also (and not inconsistently) an endearingly diffident, uncertain guy with self-esteem issues.  Even in Lilliput, he is initially intimidated by the tiny kingdom and general until he proves his worth.  Even when he is exploiting and deceiving the Lilliputians (who reminded me of the Doozers in ""Fraggle Rock""), Gulliver is sweet and gentle to all of them.  He acts as a huge, funny Cyrano de Bergerac to Horatio by giving him song lyrics from Prince help him woo the princess.  Gulliver doesn't want to hurt anyone; even when he faces the Blefuscudian armada, he tries unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the ship commanders and says he'll only pretend to attack them if they promise to leave.  When Gulliver's fortunes fall because of his deceit and he sinks into despair, I think it's touching. When he regains his confidence and vows to be a genuine hero, to both Darcy and Lilliput, I think it's both touching and inspiring.  Gulliver's tussle with the robot was also fun and even a bit hair-raising, as when the robot knocks Gulliver back and he (or maybe a stunt double) performs a temporary headstand (with no arm support).  I guess I am part of the group that like's Jack Black's frat-boyish, exuberant, but basically decent persona (as I did in ""School of Rock"" and ""King Kong""). ""GT"" showcases believable character growth and development.Ultimately, ""GT"" is what it is: an engagingly silly but enjoyably lighthearted romp with gently-presented themes of integrity, courage, and self-improvement.  And yes, I really mean that (even taking the butt-crack and urination scenes into account).",3,"Lightweight (well, actually kinda heavyweight) ""Gulliver"" still has its lighthearted

If you love him, you will probably love Gulliver.For everyone else:  Moments of cleverness, special effects and sweet humor make it watchable. I didn't see it in 3D which I'm sure added an element that would make it more watch-worthy. Overall, it is a sweetish story of growing up, doing the right thing, taking responsibility for your actions, and overcoming slackerness.Basic plot: Gulliver is the manager of the mail room at a large newspaper. He has a huge, silent crush on the travel writing editor. He packs up all his boyish pride and charm and intends to ask her out, but he flakes and pretends to want to write a travel article. She gives him a fake one to test his skills and he plagiarizes some impressive write-ups. She offers him an obscure gig in the Bermuda Triangle.  And there the story gets freaky. He's sucked into a whirlpool and wakes up on a beach and discovers that he's infested with little people --- angry little people. He goes on to befriend them by saving the king but makes an enemy out of the head of the military, the king's soon-to-be son-in-law. Drama, angst, and more drama follow, lessons are learned and everyone who deserves to lives happily ever after does.High points: The Lilliputians are extreme builders and there are very entertaining moments watching them in action. Live theater wherein the Lilliputians act out scenes from Gulliver's ""life"" are entertaining  too. ""Live"" interactive video games ala Rock Band or Guitar Hero are funny. One scene was an inappropriately laugh out loud moment for me. During the arrest scene on the beach, Gulliver's shorts get yanked on exposing some crack, and then he falls, onto one of the most unfortunate Lilliputians. The credits may have been a bigger laugh though because he was billed as the butt crack guy. My friends and I thought that would be a fabulous addition to his resume and/or a great ice breaker at parties. ""So have I seen you in anything?"" ""Well, my best part was Butt Crack Guy in Gulliver's Travels.""Low points: Lots of bathroom humor. From saving the king by putting out the fire via bladder contents, to the scene where the words Lame A--are used about ten times while Gulliver tries to convince the General that Lame A--is the ultimate in compliments, to the whispered say-what-I-say-to-your-lady-love scene, to the anti-war dance, there are plenty of flat or odd moments. Gulliver's relationship with Darcy (Amanda Peet) is not real fleshed out or believable, and Emily Blunt really doesn't get much of a chance to shine.It's worth the investment of a Red Box or Netflix rental.

1303969,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG97WE,Mark Turner,"[9, 13]","There are comedians who make some hilarious movies. The problem is that they have a certain shtick that they use...and then use again...and then use again and again and again until they've played it out so often that they fade to obscurity. That or they begin to make movies that folks never pay to see any more (see Eddie Murphy). Face it, when you rely on the same character or style over and over again people will tire of you quickly. Such is the case with Jack Black and especially his new DVD release GULLIVER'S TRAVELS.Black stars as Gulliver, the head of the mailroom for a magazine. As he introduces the new guy to the job, we get to see him ignored by most of the staff and his longing for the travel editor Darcy (Amanda Peet). By the end of the day this new employee has taken his job and let him know that he'll always been in the position he's in because he has no backbone, no ambition to move forward. He also notes the same holds true with his affection for Darcy, a love that will go unrequited because he never makes a move towards her.This changes when he stops by her office that night intending to let her know how he feels. But he backs down and tells her that he's actually there to sign up as a writer for her department. She's glad and gives him an assignment except that he's never been anywhere and has no idea what to write. A few moment of copy and paste and suddenly he's got a new job. And a new assignment, heading to the Bermuda Triangle to look into the truth behind it.With no idea what he's doing he soon finds himself heading for a swirling mass of water going up rather than down. His boat is swept up and the next thing he knows he's been washed ashore of an island inhabited by people who stand about 4 inches tall, the Lilliputians. Captured by egomaniacal officer General Edward (Chris O'Dowd) and their army, he's forced into a life of servitude making friends with another prisoner named Horatio (Jason Segel). Horatio's crime is falling in love with Princess Mary (Emily Blunt) who is betrothed to General Edward.A chance rescue of the Princess wins Gulliver freedom and the same for his new friend. He becomes the protector of the country. All the while Edward attempts to knock down this new hero and take back his place atop the crowd. When that fails, he sets out to take over the kingdom or at least assist in it.Can Gulliver save the day? Can he take on Edward? Will Horatio and Princess Mary finally get together? Will Gulliver ever have the chance to woo Darcy? WHO CARES!This movie is perhaps one of the worst that I've ever seen and that's saying something. I like almost every movie I watch in one way or another. But this film is terrible from start to finish. And the biggest reason is the center of it all, Jack Black. This is not a portrayal of Gulliver but the same goofy oddball that he's played in almost every movie he's made. This character always tries to act cool, to act like he's in the know, to create words of his own making to display how with it he is. The problem is that while it may have been funny the first time it has now become downright intolerable. Okay we get it Jack, you're the goofball who pretends to be hip but who isn't. Ha ha.The jokes are some of the lamest ever written. That is if they were intended to be jokes. Who knows, there was never one moment that I found myself smiling let alone laughing. The acting is on par with junior high plays...I take that back. That would be an insult to junior high school actors. But perhaps its less their problem seeing as how most of these actors are quite good and thus the fault of the director.Another thing that insults the audience is the special effects. In a time when we can make spaceships seem real, when we can make hobbits and orcs look like they could actually exists, the special effects displayed here seem lame. One would think they would outshine those seen in the 1960 film THE 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVER but they don't. I'm not even certain that children would be impressed with these effects.But the main thing remains Jack Black. I like him. I loved his earlier films. He just needs to move forward. The same thing has happened with comedic actors in the past. As I said, Eddie Murphy went from making some of the best comedies around to making lame movies where he does the same thing over and over again. Robin Williams was another comedic actor who headed that direction until he finally realized that doing the same character with a different name won't get people to watch your movie.Black did a great job in KING KONG.

You can only watch so many film where he gurns and plays air guitar before it wears a bit thin.  The rest of the cast, which includes some great British names, are all rather wooden and the dialogue is atrocious.Thankfully the effects are reasonable and this also has a decent soundtrack which helps redeem it.I guess this film is aimed more towards a child audience and they may well enjoy it more than my wife and I did.

I think his role was perfect here and I do think he would be happy with such a ""unique"" production. The twist is unique and children were laughing a lot in the theatre so it is entertaining.I think the direction could have been better. I think the story was lacking. The Mail Room replacement could have been meaner; there could have been a better story here. The big lesson(s) was/were missing.If you are 8 years old, or have 8 year olds they may well love this. I think it would be a great way to spend the afternoon with a bucket of popcorn and Pepsi in hand.  It is by no means painful to watch. The adults I watched it with were slightly disappointed, but CRITICAL to remember that this is not aimed at adults. Admittedly there were very funny parts that even the tightest of grinches would have to laugh at.If you are a Jack Black fan it's a most see.I rate this 5 for the children in the audience and a 2/3 from myself and the other adults. A true feeling would be a 3.5. Be fair, if you honestly like movies that are a little immature (in the most positive of ways) you will be up there with the 5 perhaps.Tenacious D",4,3.5,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1275,"['love', 'Jack', 'Black', 'especially', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'years', 'see', 'link', 'beware', 'may', 'say', 'immature', 'also', 'great', 'talent', 'think', 'role', 'was', 'perfect', 'here', 'do', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'unique', 'production', 'twist', 'unique', 'children', 'were', 'laughing', 'lot', 'theatre', 'entertaining.I', 'think', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'think', 'story', 'was', 'lacking', 'Mail', 'Room', 'replacement', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'meaner', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'story', 'here', 'big', 'lesson', 'was/were', 'missing.If', 'are', '8', 'years', 'old', 'have', '8', 'year', 'olds', 'may', 'well', 'love', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'way', 'spend', 'afternoon', 'bucket', 'popcorn', 'Pepsi', 'hand', 'means', 'painful', 'watch', 'adults', 'watched', 'were', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'CRITICAL', 'remember', 'not', 'aimed', 'adults', 'Admittedly', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'parts', 'even', 'tightest', 'grinches', 'would', 'have', 'laugh', 'at.If', 'are', 'Jack', 'Black', 'fan', 'most', 'see.I', 'rate', '5', 'children', 'audience', '2/3', 'other', 'adults', 'true', 'feeling', 'would', 'be', '3.5', 'Be', 'fair', 'honestly', 'movies', 'are', 'little', 'immature', 'most', 'positive', 'ways', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'there', '5', 'perhaps.Tenacious', 'D']",N/A

This has been the way of Hollywood. Vampires and werewolves: chick flick. Red Riding Hood: chick flick. The sinking of the Titanic: chick flick. Red Sox Nation: chick flick. Shouldn't us guys get a warning label? Please Please, leave Star Trek alone!!!The product placement in the movie was higher than normal, Coke, Red Bull, Cremora, Planet Hollywood to name a few. If we list other movies, we would have to use scientific notaion.Jack Black, mail room boy, has a crush on the travel editor at the newspaper where he is employed. He ends up writing a story for her which lands him trip to the Bermuda Triangle. This in turn sends him to Lilliput where he ends up helping a lowly commoner in love with the princess. Not too difficult to figure out the symbolism. Jack has the Lilliputians construct items similar to our own. While there is humor in this, as well humor in Jack's fascination with Star Wars and Guitar Hero. However, the movie lacks the biting political satire of the original tale, something they could of done if they had a half decent script writer.No nudity, unless you count Jack Black's butt crack, no sex, no f-bombs.
