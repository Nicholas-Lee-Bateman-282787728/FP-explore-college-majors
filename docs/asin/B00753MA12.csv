1526456,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B00753MA12,Ron,"[2, 2]","This isn't the worst movie ever and its far from being the best ever too!I rented this because it had Berenger, Coyote and Brolin in the cast and I had high hopes that it would be a good drama/thriller.The story is about a woman (O'neal) who marries a wealthy and powerful man (Berenger) who's family is connected with everything in Kansas City. The new wife throws a wrench in the works of a new high rise condo complex that the other two brothers run. This action leads to changes in the will and O'neal will inherit everything leaving the two brothers penniless. That's the setup for the story before all heck breaks loose in a power play move.I was somewhat disappointed with the writing and the direction, but by far the worst part of this production was the acting with the worst of the worst award going to Tatum O'neal. I could not believe her performance especially in one scene when she gets angry stomps her foot and has a mini temper tantrum. The story was neither a good drama nor was it much of a thriller due to the acting, transparent plot and the less than stellar writing.The movie had very little cursing, and very tame gore and violence, but did have a couple of scenes of topless women and a man having sex with a woman exposing her backside.3 stars for this average drama and nothing more.",3,WELL???,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,1311,"[""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'far', 'being', 'best', 'ever', 'too', 'rented', 'had', 'Berenger', 'Coyote', 'Brolin', 'cast', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'drama/thriller.The', 'story', 'woman', ""O'neal"", 'who', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'man', 'Berenger', 'who', 'family', 'connected', 'everything', 'Kansas', 'City', 'new', 'wife', 'wrench', 'works', 'new', 'high', 'rise', 'condo', 'complex', 'other', 'two', 'brothers', 'run', 'action', 'changes', 'will', ""O'neal"", 'will', 'inherit', 'everything', 'leaving', 'two', 'brothers', 'penniless', 'setup', 'story', 'heck', 'breaks', 'loose', 'power', 'play', 'move.I', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'writing', 'direction', 'far', 'worst', 'part', 'production', 'was', 'acting', 'worst', 'worst', 'award', 'going', 'Tatum', ""O'neal"", 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'performance', 'especially', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'angry', 'stomps', 'foot', 'mini', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'drama', 'was', 'much', 'thriller', 'due', 'acting', 'transparent', 'plot', 'less', 'stellar', 'writing.The', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'cursing', 'very', 'tame', 'gore', 'violence', 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'scenes', 'topless', 'women', 'man', 'having', 'sex', 'woman', 'exposing', 'backside.3', 'stars', 'average', 'drama', 'nothing', 'more']",Last Will

The movie opens with a death and then goes back six months earlier. Hayden (Tatum) marries into the wealthy Emery family who own Kansas City real estate. The wedding was very pretentious and the acting reminded me of porn star quality. Frank Emery (Tom Berenger) is a surgeon. His brothers manage the real estate which Frank owns.Hayden discovers they are evil slum lords and wants to change it. She convinces Frank, who fires his brothers and the next thing you know Frank is dead, with a new will cutting out Hayden, and Hayden is framed for his death.That is the bare bones plot. The court room scenes are laughable as Hayden takes the stand and is grilled by Moon Unit Zappa dressed all in black, apparently a stipulation in her contract. The movie reminded me of a soap opera series, with trite dialouge and cutout characters. The occasional jazz soundtrack didn't seem to fit the film.The plot wasn't that bad, it was just executed so badly it makes it unbearable to watch. Alan Moskowitz, who writes for TV series was the script writer. Actor/writer/director Brent Huff directed this mess. He is still best known for his role in ""The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak.""Parental Guide: No sex. No f-bombs that I recall, although I did a lot of fast forwarding.
