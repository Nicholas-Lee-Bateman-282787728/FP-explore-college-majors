1362982,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B003TYI092,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[0, 0]","&#34;Two On A Guillotine&#34; looks for all the world like a WiIliam Castle spook epic, but it's not. Its actually a bit too mild to match up to one of Mr C's works, which is saying something. However if you are a fan of things like &#34;House on Haunted Hill&#34;, you should enjoy this.There's a very slim plot: perky Connie Stevens plays Cassie, called to the funeral and will-reading of her eccentric father who was a famous magician, although the two had been strangers for many years before his mysterious death. The will states that Cassie must spend 7 nights in her fathers mansion or lose the inheritance, which will instead to go two housekeepers. And as soon as she moves in spooky things start happening..will she be frightened into to leaving the house or clever enough to work out who is behind it?Talk about the creakiest of old plots! There's really nothing in the plot to get excited about, although at least the script does not paint the characters as idiots - Cassie (and her protector/suitor) find out almost straight away that the spooky occurrences are being faked, so at least that's one plot twist out of the way. But who is doing it and why? Again, as I said, there's not much plot to go around and there are hardly any characters in the cast, so guessing the truth is not that hard.However I still enjoyed the movie. It's nicely shot, in widescreen crisp black and white (well, mostly crisp, as focus goes off now and again), and the dialogue is entertaining. Soem shots are actually very stylish, and there's a pretty cool sequence set in a noisy nightclub that culminates in an embrace, which is set up very strangely, but I really liked how they did it. There's very little to actually scare you, although there is a bit of fun to be found in a couple of &#34;body horror&#34; effects (I'm trying not to reveal what they are!)Curiously I've been seeking out kooky horror movies my whole life and had never even heard of this film until now (2014), which shows how hard to find it has been, Thankfully now released on the Warner Archive label, it;s a lovely looking print, and worth getting if you like not-too-serious 1960's chillers.",3,Silly but fun,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,2163,"['34', 'Two', 'A', 'Guillotine', '34', 'looks', 'world', 'WiIliam', 'Castle', 'spook', 'epic', 'not', 'actually', 'bit', 'too', 'mild', 'match', 'up', 'one', 'Mr', 'C', 'works', 'saying', 'something', 'However', 'are', 'fan', 'things', '34', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', '34', 'should', 'enjoy', 'very', 'slim', 'plot', 'perky', 'Connie', 'Stevens', 'Cassie', 'called', 'funeral', 'will-reading', 'eccentric', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'famous', 'magician', 'two', 'had', 'been', 'strangers', 'many', 'years', 'mysterious', 'death', 'will', 'Cassie', 'must', 'spend', '7', 'nights', 'fathers', 'mansion', 'lose', 'inheritance', 'will', 'instead', 'go', 'two', 'housekeepers', 'as', 'soon', 'spooky', 'things', 'start', 'happening..will', 'be', 'frightened', 'leaving', 'house', 'clever', 'enough', 'work', 'out', 'who', 'Talk', 'creakiest', 'old', 'plots', 'really', 'nothing', 'plot', 'get', 'excited', 'about', 'least', 'script', 'not', 'paint', 'characters', 'idiots', 'Cassie', 'protector/suitor', 'find', 'out', 'almost', 'straight', 'away', 'spooky', 'occurrences', 'are', 'being', 'faked', 'so', 'least', 'one', 'plot', 'twist', 'way', 'who', 'doing', 'why', 'Again', 'said', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'go', 'around', 'are', 'hardly', 'characters', 'cast', 'guessing', 'truth', 'not', 'hard.However', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'nicely', 'shot', 'widescreen', 'crisp', 'black', 'white', 'well', 'mostly', 'crisp', 'focus', 'off', 'now', 'again', 'dialogue', 'entertaining', 'Soem', 'shots', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'stylish', 'pretty', 'cool', 'sequence', 'set', 'noisy', 'nightclub', 'embrace', 'set', 'up', 'very', 'strangely', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'did', 'very', 'little', 'actually', 'scare', 'bit', 'fun', 'be', 'found', 'couple', '34', 'body', 'horror', '34', 'effects', ""'m"", 'trying', 'not', 'reveal', 'what', 'are', 'Curiously', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeking', 'out', 'kooky', 'horror', 'movies', 'whole', 'life', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'film', 'now', '2014', 'how', 'hard', 'find', 'been', 'Thankfully', 'now', 'released', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'label', 'lovely', 'looking', 'print', 'getting', 'not-too-serious', '1960', 'chillers']",Two On A Guillotine

1362989,ALJWRGOANWDWJ,B003TYI092,Jack-O-Lantern,"[3, 4]","The last time I saw this movie was 40+ years ago, and the intervening years have been quite kind to this little gem!  I had forgotten all about 'Two On A Guillotine,' even after watching it countless times on local 'Creature Features' shows and Saturday afternoon television runs in the 60s as a little kid.  I was thrilled to see that Warner Archives has resurrected this film, an 'old dark house' tale that still retains its power to conjure up a jolly good time, as well as a few scares!Connie Stevens is surprisingly effective in her dual role as the wife and daughter of a famous magician who has passed away, promising to return from the afterlife.  Gorgeous, perky and, as others have noted, a GREAT screamer!!!  Cesar Romero proves yet again that he could chew scenery with the best of them, and though his screen time is minimal, his presence is felt throughout the film.  Dean Jones, the penultimate guy-next-door, provides not only the love interest, but also a grounding in reality that helps keep Connie in check as she slides slowly into hysteria.Though it takes awhile to get going (quite awhile, actually, thus the 4-star rating), once it kicks into gear this becomes quite a little roller coaster ride.  Excellent black-and-white cinematography, an amazing, grandiose final score from the legendary Max Steiner, and even some directorial flourishes that still seem fresh and original today.  Genuine suspense toward the last third of the film, which climaxes with a satisfying return to the guillotine first glimpsed in the preamble to the film.The print is in amazing condition--I believe this truly is a ""remastered edition"" as the packaging notes, in full anamorphic widescreen glory here and just gorgeous to look at.  I am SO impressed, and couldn't care less if this is a DVD-R...I'm thrilled to have this underrated, ""lost"" film in my permanent library!  BRAVO, Warners!My dogs and I watched this last night, by ourselves, with the lights down and the popcorn bowl within easy reach.  SO much fun, I highly recommend this to anyone, especially us children of the 60s who LIVED for this kind of movie when we were little (you know who you are)!

It looks clear enough but has a slight softness to the picture. It's still in great condtion and very watchable nonetheless. For any horror fan of a certain age who has never seen 1965's ""Two on a Guillotine"" here's your chance. For any fan period. For those not old enough to remember it, it's a B&W and non-gory old house shocker. It's wonderfully campy by today's standards and it does involve a guillotine. Sixties cutie Connie Stevens plays two roles, Cesar Romero plays a mad magician/Grand Guignol illusionist and Dean Jones is a reporter out for a scoop. When her father, the Great Duquesne (Romero), dies, his will stipulates Stevens must spend 7 nights in his supposedly haunted mansion to get her inheritance. The Great Duquesne also stated he would come back from the grave. Of course, she's then subjected to a house of horrors complete with a mysterious locked room whose key has been buried with her father. Romero is excellent in a role Vincent Price would have had a field day with. Stevens does her two roles (playing both mother and daughter) appropriately and is a great screamer and Dean Jones is, well, Dean Jones. Everyone overacts and over re-acts to a degree and there are maybe a few too many cutesy moments, but this is still enjoyable and completely harmless entertainment in a ghoulish sense.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[4, 4]","William Conrad, the mellifluent baritone and star of ""Cannon,"" ""Nero Wolfe"" and ""Jake and the Fatman"" was once a prolific director and producer, but always a consummate entertainer.  He directed three films in 1965 for Warner Bros. and they have shown up one by one on Warner Archive.  ""Brainstorm"" starring Jeffrey Hunter and Anne Francis was a little dated when it was released, and old-fashioned studio picture, but still entertaining.  ""Two on a Guillotine"" (starring Connie Stevens and Dean Jones) and ""My Blood Runs Cold"" (which starred Troy Donahue and Joey Heatherton) were directed more at the teen audience.  I prefer ""Two on a Guillotine"" as ""My Blood Runs Cold"" sort of had Troy Donahue showing why his contract would not be picked up soon after in a rather distasteful role.  But ""Two on a Guillotine"" had the genuine engaging casting of Connie and Dean Jones and some nice touches mixing humor and Grand Guignol.  There is a Hitchcock kiss that is worth the cost of the DVD alone as the group, The Condors wail ""Go, Baby"" in a discotheque.  This Warner Archive edition is remastered and quite watchable, but wish they had included the trailer as an extra, but that did not happen.

The film looks like it belongs back in the fifties borrowing heavily from William Castle's 'HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL' but has a unique spirit(no pun intended) of its own. Connie Stevens in a great dual role as both mother and daughter owns the film as the executor of the will of the estate of Cesar Romero ( a year before his stint as the Joker on the 'BATMAN' T.V. series) as illusionist Duke Duquesne who must spend seven days in his gloomy mansion in order to collect $300,000 and see him return from the grave.  A pre-Disney Dean Jones is the love interest who really shows his underrated acting abilities and gives the film a James Stewart quality. Fans will also recognize John Hoyt and a blink or you'll miss cameo from Richard Kiel(Jaws in the Roger Moore Bond films).  Actor/Director William Conrad and suspense writer Henry Slesar's script pour on the cliches and spooky hi-jinks making the film a must for horror and suspense fans. The icing on the cake is one of the last orchestral film scores of the great Max Steiner.  Available as a DVD-R from Warner Archive and now from Amazon.com, its a beautiful transfer and worth the price tag.",4,The Joker Goes Wild,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,1299,"['Here', 'film', 'read', 'Famous', 'Monsters', 'magazine', 'when', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'never', 'got', 'view', 'now', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'film', 'back', 'fifties', 'borrowing', 'heavily', 'William', 'Castle', ""'HOUSE"", 'ON', 'HAUNTED', 'HILL', 'unique', 'spirit', 'pun', 'intended', 'own', 'Connie', 'Stevens', 'great', 'dual', 'role', 'mother', 'daughter', 'film', 'executor', 'will', 'estate', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'year', 'stint', 'Joker', ""'BATMAN"", 'T.V', 'series', 'illusionist', 'Duke', 'Duquesne', 'who', 'must', 'spend', 'seven', 'days', 'gloomy', 'mansion', 'order', 'collect', '300,000', 'see', 'return', 'grave', 'pre-Disney', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'really', 'underrated', 'acting', 'abilities', 'film', 'James', 'Stewart', 'quality', 'Fans', 'will', 'also', 'recognize', 'John', 'Hoyt', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'cameo', 'Richard', 'Kiel', 'Jaws', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Bond', 'films', 'Actor/Director', 'William', 'Conrad', 'suspense', 'writer', 'Henry', 'Slesar', 'script', 'pour', 'cliches', 'spooky', 'hi-jinks', 'making', 'film', 'must', 'horror', 'suspense', 'fans', 'icing', 'cake', 'one', 'last', 'orchestral', 'film', 'scores', 'great', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'Available', 'DVD-R', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'now', 'Amazon.com', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'price', 'tag']",Two On A Guillotine
