1254661,A1TCV11CEB0EKD,B0027VSTJO,Alan Mansfield,"[3, 4]","Animaniacs was and IS a cartoon that has an incredible amount of genious minded individuals behind it.  Rob Paulsen (Raphael from the Turtles series) plays numerous characters including Pinky, as well as one of the lead characters, Yakko.  Tress MacNeille is the cute and adorable Dot, and also has a variety of other voices.  (just think back to when she was voicing Babs Bunny on Tiny Toons, she was not only Babs but like another 30 voices that Tress had to inpersonate through Babs).  Jess Harnell was a little more less known compared to the other 2 lead roles, but he did a fantastic job none the less.  Plus you've got Maurice LaMarche as Brain (and Wakko's burps!) and there were others as well, including the 3 sons of one of the producers, I believe his name was Tom Ruegger.  And this is all powered by Steven Speilberg, I mean HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Speilberg looked in on every single script, and wrote several of them as well, and he went to the scoring and voicing segements often, he was very hands on and Im pretty sure no one can deny the fact that he is a major power house director in hollywood, he just has that special something when he visualizes the direction of a movie and in his animated series as well. Essentially what Michael Jackson did to music, Speilberg does as a director.AND IT IS TIME TO RELEASE THE FINAL VOLUME OF THIS AMAZING SERIES, PLEEEEEEEEEEEASE!!!!  I mean it was I believe 17 out of 100 as the best, most outstanding animated series of all time... how can it be denied their final DVD set? IT CANT!!! RELEASE IT ALREADY!!!!!!!!!",5,LOVE IT!

1254666,AIFRJS0H0AA3A,B0027VSTJO,Mikhail Kamenskiy,"[37, 38]","Animaniacs is arguably the best cartoon TV show of the 90s created by WB. The level of depth of this project is incredible - despite being a cartoon show originally oriented towards kids and teenagers, it's drawn to well and it contains such a great amount of smart, witty jokes, and cultural references that it's interesting and funny to watch for people of all ages. Steven Spielberg's Animaniacs is a masterpiece that deserves a place in the hall of fame of the greatest cartoons of all time. I was happy to buy all the previously released sets of Animaniacs (DVD volumes 1-3) because this show is an eternal classic that all my family finds interesting to watch, and I definitely want my children to grow up on cartoon shows like this. However, I got really frustrated to see that the last, fourth volume got delayed further, and further, and further, while other WB shows of the 90s (unquestionably excellent, but in my opinion still not this great!) got released and even completed (e.g. Pinky and the Brain and Freakazoid). I keep looking for updates on Volume 4 practically daily and the day when it's finally announced and when I'm going to be able to hit the ""Pre-order"" button here on Amazon and know that the final episodes of my favorite series of all time is going to be released will definitely make me a very happy man, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one on the planet dying to get the last set of Animaniacs.Animaniacs Volume 4, when and if released, will contain the final 24 episodes of the show (76-99) and will include such masterpieces as ""Hurray for North Hollywood"" (in two parts), ""The Animaniacs Suite"", ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Clock"", and much more.Animaniacs is the show that deserves to be completed in the form of a DVD release. If you are reading this and you like cartoons, comedy, and parody, but you still haven't gotten Animaniacs volumes 1-3, I highly recommend that you get them because it's one of those shows you'll never regret buying. And if you already have volumes 1-3, definitely consider getting volume 4 once Warner Bros. finally decides to release it!",5,Can't wait for this to be released!,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,2106,"['Animaniacs', 'arguably', 'best', 'cartoon', 'TV', 'show', '90s', 'created', 'WB', 'level', 'depth', 'project', 'incredible', 'being', 'cartoon', 'show', 'originally', 'oriented', 'towards', 'kids', 'teenagers', 'drawn', 'well', 'such', 'great', 'amount', 'smart', 'witty', 'jokes', 'cultural', 'references', 'interesting', 'funny', 'watch', 'people', 'ages', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Animaniacs', 'masterpiece', 'place', 'hall', 'fame', 'greatest', 'cartoons', 'time', 'was', 'happy', 'buy', 'previously', 'released', 'sets', 'Animaniacs', 'DVD', 'volumes', '1-3', 'show', 'eternal', 'classic', 'family', 'interesting', 'watch', 'definitely', 'want', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'cartoon', 'shows', 'However', 'got', 'really', 'frustrated', 'see', 'last', 'fourth', 'volume', 'got', 'delayed', 'further', 'further', 'further', 'other', 'WB', 'shows', '90s', 'unquestionably', 'excellent', 'opinion', 'still', 'not', 'great', 'got', 'released', 'even', 'completed', 'e.g', 'Pinky', 'Brain', 'Freakazoid', 'keep', 'looking', 'updates', 'Volume', '4', 'practically', 'daily', 'day', 'when', 'finally', 'announced', 'when', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'able', 'hit', 'Pre-order', 'button', 'here', 'Amazon', 'know', 'final', 'episodes', 'favorite', 'series', 'time', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'very', 'happy', 'man', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'planet', 'dying', 'get', 'last', 'set', 'Animaniacs.Animaniacs', 'Volume', '4', 'when', 'released', 'will', 'contain', 'final', '24', 'episodes', 'show', '76-99', 'will', 'include', 'such', 'masterpieces', 'Hurray', 'North', 'Hollywood', 'two', 'parts', 'Animaniacs', 'Suite', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Clock', 'much', 'more.Animaniacs', 'show', 'be', 'completed', 'form', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'reading', 'like', 'cartoons', 'comedy', 'parody', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'Animaniacs', 'volumes', '1-3', 'highly', 'recommend', 'get', 'one', 'shows', ""'ll"", 'never', 'regret', 'buying', 'already', 'have', 'volumes', '1-3', 'definitely', 'consider', 'getting', 'volume', '4', 'once', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'finally', 'release']","Animaniacs, Vol. 4"

I think it was unfair of WB to put out the first three seasons and then hold back the fourth and final disk.Animaniacs was a refreshing show, at a time when most cartoons were aimed directly for young kids and had to meet a marketing agenda. Animaniacs offered social and political commentary in a way that was fun for kids, but insightful for the adults. A true family comedy where old and young could watch and enjoy. This was very much in line with the original Looney Tunes which were written for adults.I am curious as to how Star Warners wound up in the Pinky and the Brain DVD. I realize that the segment did start and end with P&B; theme however, it was originally broadcast as part of the Animaniac's 99th episode and included the The Scoring Session, Star Warners, Animaniacs Suite and a short Good Feathers clip. I know because I still have the recording I taped when it first aired.But please, please, please WB release the 4th Animaniacs DVD.
