I also miss the romance,which a friend told me existed, between Greg Brady and the coroner.  I definitely think another season or two should be added for a bit of something between Bobby and Alex.

1594809,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B009CSVRNU,D. S. Thurlow,"[6, 7]","The Ninth Season of ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" opens with a catastrophic two-part story which results in the departure of detectives Goren and Eames, and their boss, from the major case squad.  Their replacements are Detectives Nichols (Jeff Goldblum) and Stevens (Saffron Burrows) and a new boss (played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio).  The tried and true format of the series remains the same, as the detectives investigate unusual murders, smoke out the intent of the suspects, and try to wring a confession out of them.Season Nine offers sixteen new episodes and a procession of interesting guest stars.  The cases range from mob bosses to serial killers to revenge for old murders, and more.  Perhaps most interesting, at least for some viewers, will be the evolving dynamics between the two new detectives.  Nichols is the black sheep of a family of doctors, who sometimes seem over-educated for a detective.  Stevens is a hardworking single mom, transferring in from the Detroit police department.  The two detectives will take awhile to get used to each other's operating styles, but it's fun to watch two talented actors work it out on screen.  Nichols and Stevens are risk-takers, but the new boss usually gives them lots of room to solve their cases.  One of the better episodes involves a serial killer, put in jail by Stevens, who claims to be innocent on the eve of his execution, just as a copy-cat killer seems to strike.  Nichols will be driven beyond the call of duty to obtain the confession that could save his partner's peace of mind.""Criminal Intent: Year Nine"" is recommended to fans of the series who are prepared to take on the shift change.",4,Shift Change...,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,1671,"['Ninth', 'Season', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'catastrophic', 'two-part', 'story', 'results', 'departure', 'detectives', 'Goren', 'Eames', 'boss', 'major', 'case', 'squad', 'replacements', 'are', 'Detectives', 'Nichols', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Stevens', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'new', 'boss', 'played', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mastrontonio', 'tried', 'true', 'format', 'series', 'same', 'detectives', 'investigate', 'unusual', 'murders', 'smoke', 'out', 'intent', 'suspects', 'try', 'wring', 'confession', 'them.Season', 'Nine', 'sixteen', 'new', 'episodes', 'procession', 'interesting', 'guest', 'stars', 'cases', 'range', 'mob', 'bosses', 'serial', 'killers', 'revenge', 'old', 'murders', 'more', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'least', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'evolving', 'dynamics', 'two', 'new', 'detectives', 'Nichols', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'doctors', 'who', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'over-educated', 'detective', 'Stevens', 'hardworking', 'single', 'mom', 'transferring', 'Detroit', 'police', 'department', 'two', 'detectives', 'will', 'take', 'awhile', 'get', 'used', 'other', 'operating', 'styles', 'fun', 'watch', 'two', 'talented', 'actors', 'work', 'out', 'screen', 'Nichols', 'Stevens', 'are', 'risk-takers', 'new', 'boss', 'usually', 'lots', 'room', 'solve', 'cases', 'One', 'better', 'episodes', 'serial', 'killer', 'put', 'jail', 'Stevens', 'who', 'be', 'innocent', 'eve', 'execution', 'just', 'copy-cat', 'killer', 'strike', 'Nichols', 'will', 'be', 'driven', 'call', 'duty', 'obtain', 'confession', 'could', 'save', 'partner', 'peace', 'mind', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'Year', 'Nine', 'recommended', 'fans', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'prepared', 'take', 'shift', 'change']",Law & Order: Criminal Intent: Year Nine

1594812,ALFRR0XFLRRC,B009CSVRNU,"Jean Richmond ""Jean Richmond""","[11, 14]","I'm a huge fan of the original Law and Order-but grew to love Criminal Intent- most especially watching D'Onofrio and Erbe's characters develop. But this season is terrible. Tragic of course in realizing that Goren and Eames were leaving- and then the writing went to hell! Most of these episodes make no sense. ""Palimpsest"" is possibly the worst-Goldblum overacts the hell out of it (which is nothing new) but there's no clear plot. Other episodes have the detectives telling a women's spouse that she's been cheating on him- the wife's lover is dead-they think her husband did it-so they confront him and leave?? Cue next scene and here's the police, remarkably arriving on time as said husband is beating his wife. L and O may not always have been sticklers for following procedure but this? All I could think if Goren and Eames had this case, they would've bent the rules if they had to, to protect the wive and find the killer. Add to this the pointless addition of Mastrantinio as Captain-who seems to just run around picking up and laying down files-she adds mothing to the story.What a terrible shame. I'm still looking forward to getting the final season. In short-avoid this-or get the first 2 episodes only. Just atrocious. And I'm not sure what reviewer ""Keene"" is talking about - I agree that Mz Erbe is a terrific actress-but she leaves at the end of the 2nd episode (I think her work is terrific in general, she was recently on Broadway playing Pat Nixon-and my favorite episode of hers is ""Amends"" when her husband's murder case is re-opened). But Burrows gets no ""standing ovation"", midway through the episode ""traffic"" she gets some wolf whistles-she's all glammed up having just come from a interview with a Madame of a Escort agency!!
