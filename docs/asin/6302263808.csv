304615,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,6302263808,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[7, 21]","This movie frankly is awful and pointless.  It attempts to show the story of a prostitute and what her life is like but I could never tell if the movie was supposed to be a satire, if it was supposed to be comedy because it's characters were such caricatures, or if it was supposed to taken seriously.  Either way, the movie lacks anything remotely interesting.  It's neither titillating nor enlightening.  In short, it's a waste of a few hours.",1,Terrible Movie,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,445,"['movie', 'frankly', 'awful', 'pointless', 'show', 'story', 'prostitute', 'what', 'life', 'could', 'never', 'tell', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'satire', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'characters', 'were', 'such', 'caricatures', 'was', 'supposed', 'taken', 'seriously', 'way', 'movie', 'anything', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'titillating', 'enlightening', 'short', 'waste', 'few', 'hours']",Whore VHS
304616,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,6302263808,D. Hartley,"[13, 14]","Director Ken Russell has never been accused of understatement, and this in-your-face character study of a jaded streetwalker is no exception. Theresa Russell chews major scenery in the lead role. The film has been misunderstood by viewers who miss the black comic undertones (I find it interesting that in 2006, no one blinks at Amy Sedaris' broad portrayal of a 42 year-old ex-hooker going back to high school on Comedy Central's ""Strangers With Candy"", but we still have reviewers tsk-tsking over Russell's 1991 treatment of the subject!) There are pacing issues that betray the story's stage play origins. Russell's character addresses the audience throughout, making the story a bit ""talky"" at times. In fact, characters in the film spend much more time TALKING about sex than actually engaging in it! Definitely a cult item. Currently not available on DVD, but used VHS copies can tracked down. Beware of the butchered ""R"" rated prints; the uncut ""European"" version contains 7 extra minutes (the excised scenes are actually tame by current standards). A note to my fellow reviewer regarding Ms. Russell's marital status: She is NOT married to Ken Russell, but to director Nicholas Roeg.",3,Ho ho ho!,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,1191,"['Director', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'never', 'been', 'accused', 'understatement', 'in-your-face', 'character', 'study', 'jaded', 'streetwalker', 'exception', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'major', 'scenery', 'lead', 'role', 'film', 'been', 'misunderstood', 'viewers', 'who', 'miss', 'black', 'comic', 'undertones', 'find', 'interesting', '2006', 'one', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'broad', 'portrayal', '42', 'year-old', 'ex-hooker', 'going', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'still', 'have', 'reviewers', 'tsk-tsking', 'Russell', '1991', 'treatment', 'subject', 'are', 'pacing', 'issues', 'betray', 'story', 'stage', 'play', 'Russell', 'character', 'audience', 'making', 'story', 'bit', 'talky', 'times', 'fact', 'characters', 'film', 'spend', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'TALKING', 'sex', 'actually', 'engaging', 'Definitely', 'cult', 'item', 'Currently', 'not', 'available', 'DVD', 'used', 'VHS', 'copies', 'can', 'tracked', 'down', 'Beware', 'butchered', 'R', 'rated', 'prints', 'uncut', 'European', 'version', '7', 'extra', 'minutes', 'excised', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'tame', 'current', 'standards', 'note', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'regarding', 'Ms.', 'Russell', 'marital', 'status', 'NOT', 'married', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'director', 'Nicholas', 'Roeg']",Whore VHS

She is a beatiful street-walker, has pimp problems, acts so believable that it's hard to watch at times. What a great actress!Oh, did I see a one-star review copied three times in order to lower the general rating of this film?Well, just watch it and let your daughter watch it too!

304618,AM0G4IO57D2Z4,6302263808,"""ninetwob""","[16, 24]","The only one reason that I have seen this film is the director of this film, Ken Russell who is one of my favorite directors. However, contrary to my expectations, it gives only disappointment. As the title shows, it describes a life of one prostitute who threads streets of the city. At the beginning, this film progresses with her conversation to the audience that how she has became a prostitute and how she has lived. This kind of form makes a characteristic feeling, but as the whole, this film has lost persuasiveness. Unfortunately, I think, the director of this film, Ken Russell did not show what he really wants to talk about. This kind of film has to evoke sympathy from the audience, but it is lacking in this point. So, it was not particularly interesting and has no impression or excitement. After all, it just became a trashy work of Ken Russell&iexcl;s films. He brought forward a problem well, but solving this problem was little bit clumsy.",3,A trashy work of Ken Russell.,1022371200,"05 26, 2002",2002,958,"['only', 'one', 'reason', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'director', 'film', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'who', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'However', 'contrary', 'expectations', 'only', 'disappointment', 'title', 'life', 'one', 'prostitute', 'who', 'streets', 'city', 'beginning', 'film', 'conversation', 'audience', 'how', 'became', 'prostitute', 'how', 'lived', 'kind', 'form', 'characteristic', 'feeling', 'whole', 'film', 'lost', 'persuasiveness', 'Unfortunately', 'think', 'director', 'film', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'what', 'really', 'talk', 'kind', 'film', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'lacking', 'point', 'So', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'impression', 'excitement', 'just', 'became', 'trashy', 'work', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'iexcl', 's', 'films', 'brought', 'forward', 'problem', 'well', 'solving', 'problem', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'clumsy']",Whore VHS
