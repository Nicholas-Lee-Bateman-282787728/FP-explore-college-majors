The story-line is not very original: two people meet with the intent of having casual sex and end up finding themselves more involved in some sort of relationship than they predicted (or wanted to). The screen-play is also not particularly original or interesting.Still, the movie works very well, in large part, I think, thanks to the two main characters. David Wenham and Susie Porter are just perfect in their roles and they play very very well their parts. The so-called ""chemistry"" between them works remarkably well, which is essential, because 90% of the screen time is taken by them and only them. I also really liked the fact that none of the two actors are particularly beautiful or in any sense ""super"" (nor does the director try to make them especially so. Many close-ups are quite ruthless in showing lines and wrinkles). This makes the whole story so much more real and interesting. The minor characters (friends of his or hers) that also sometimes appear to ""comment"" on the craziness that is happening to their friends are also well played.Overall, not a masterpiece but a very nice and well done romantic sexy comedy!",4,Interesting!,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,1232,"['definitely', 'NOT', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'very', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'story-line', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'two', 'people', 'meet', 'intent', 'having', 'casual', 'sex', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'more', 'involved', 'sort', 'relationship', 'predicted', 'wanted', 'screen-play', 'also', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'interesting.Still', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'large', 'part', 'think', 'thanks', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'David', 'Wenham', 'Susie', 'Porter', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'roles', 'play', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'parts', 'so-called', 'chemistry', 'remarkably', 'well', 'essential', '90', '%', 'screen', 'time', 'taken', 'only', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'fact', 'none', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'sense', 'super', 'director', 'try', 'make', 'especially', 'so', 'Many', 'close-ups', 'are', 'quite', 'ruthless', 'showing', 'lines', 'wrinkles', 'whole', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'interesting', 'minor', 'characters', 'friends', 'hers', 'also', 'sometimes', 'appear', 'comment', 'craziness', 'happening', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'played.Overall', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'nice', 'well', 'done', 'romantic', 'sexy', 'comedy']",N/A

It has a simple story about a relationship between a man and a woman, but goes beyond the usual talk talk yada yada of common relationship movies. It is fun, steamy, and definitely adult. It is highlighted by very good performances from David Wenham and the naturally sexy and freckled Susie Porter. This movie is not without a life message- beware of chance meetings and casual acquaintances. They may lead to something unexpected or surprising... but that could be a good thing. Also, beware of omnipresent female taxi drivers.

The tag line pretty much sums it up -- what was intended as a one night stand turns into more than the participants expect. Sexy -- definitely (I may never look at wildlife documentaries quite the same way again); funny -- in many places hilarious, especially when examining the Mars/Venus aspect of burgeoning relationships (toilet seats, dressing time); and surprisingly sweet. The stars are charming, attractive and very real, both emotionally and physically (after years of plastic Hollywood types, you have NO idea how pleasant it is to see a good looking guy who is NOT Mr. Universe, and a good looking woman without augmentation), and are ably supported by the rest of the cast, particularly the actress (whose name I now can't remember, my apologies!) who plays the cabbie and doubles as a relationship counselor.There's a saying that life is what happens when you're busy making plans -- perhaps love is what can happen when you're busy having sex, if you let it.

It is set almost entirely in the loft of Cin, the female lead.  Cin meets the male lead, Josh, at a party and shares a cab with him.  They then have a one night stand that lasts for three days.  These two characters are so likable and cute together that the movie doesn't need much of anything else.  The movie occasionally cuts to comments about Cin and Josh, made by their friends, that help us to understand a little about their love histories.  There is one scene with one of Cin's friends that shows she has some insecurity.  Being a virtual stranger, Josh doesn't understand Cin's behavior and leaves (temporarily).  The chemistry of the actors makes the [love] scenes really hot and the dialog is great, too.
