This was good on two levels, my 3 year old daughter was entranced by it, and it had a clear story line to follow. It reminded me a bit of Rapunzel and Swan Lake maybe it was the flying horse? But a strong heroine again - it also returned to the use of classical music which I enjoyed listening to in the background.All Princess Annika wants to do is skate, but her parents don't approve. Even so she sneaks out and does it - only Wenlock, an evil wizard hears about her beauty and comes to find her to take her for his bride. She resists and to force her to marry him Wenlock enchants her family setting them in ice as statues along with all the villagers. Annika is saved by a winged horse (her sister Brietta under enchantment). She has three days to try to find the key to breaking the spell - or the people and her parents will stay as statues forever. Along the way she finds love (in the form of the penitent Aidan who has lost all his family's money) and she finds friends and allies - as well as breaking her sister's enchantment. It has some simple and nice messages in it as well - sisterly love, taking only what you need, empathy etc.It is nice to see a return to simpler storylines - Fairytopia (the last Barbie movie) had a complicated storyline and seemed to be all about marketing as many dolls as possible. With two main characters and a winged horse (who is 'Barbie's' sister but has been under enchantment), the story was easier for the kids to follow along. the costumes were more reminiscent of classical fairytales as well. I guess I will be getting a bit of grief from my kids about buying them the toys to go with this. I don't know if I will or not - but at least other barbie dolls can be used in the fray - Anneliese and Erika could be dressed up - even rapunzel, or using Marzipan from Nutcracker if you have any of themThe animation on tis was very good I loved the way the hair moved during the ice skating scenes for instance so it seems to be getting better with each movie. There were good bright colours. the 3D is great too and the glasses that come with this are Barbie branded, however, just watch out, the littlies don't like keeping them on their noses and are more interested in experimenting with everything else in the house - 4 pairs don't last long. you can order more but it is an expensive kind of novelty - I think I appreicated it more than they did!This is a good movie, but all I would ask is that Barbie goes back to all singing all dancing like in Princess and the Pauper, that was a great movie!",4,Barbie is back to simpler story lines - kind of mix of  Rapunzel/swan lake,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,2604,"['How', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'out', 'New', 'Zealand', 'already', 'was', 'good', 'two', 'levels', '3', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'was', 'entranced', 'had', 'clear', 'story', 'line', 'follow', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Rapunzel', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'maybe', 'was', 'flying', 'horse', 'strong', 'heroine', 'again', 'also', 'returned', 'use', 'classical', 'music', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'background.All', 'Princess', 'Annika', 'do', 'skate', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'approve', 'Even', 'out', 'only', 'Wenlock', 'evil', 'wizard', 'beauty', 'find', 'take', 'bride', 'force', 'marry', 'Wenlock', 'family', 'setting', 'ice', 'statues', 'villagers', 'Annika', 'saved', 'winged', 'horse', 'sister', 'Brietta', 'enchantment', 'three', 'days', 'try', 'find', 'key', 'breaking', 'spell', 'people', 'parents', 'will', 'stay', 'statues', 'forever', 'way', 'love', 'form', 'penitent', 'Aidan', 'who', 'lost', 'family', 'money', 'friends', 'allies', 'as', 'well', 'breaking', 'sister', 'enchantment', 'simple', 'nice', 'messages', 'as', 'well', 'sisterly', 'love', 'taking', 'only', 'what', 'need', 'empathy', 'etc.It', 'nice', 'see', 'return', 'simpler', 'storylines', 'Fairytopia', 'last', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'had', 'complicated', 'storyline', 'seemed', 'be', 'about', 'marketing', 'many', 'dolls', 'possible', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'winged', 'horse', 'who', ""'Barbie"", 'sister', 'been', 'enchantment', 'story', 'was', 'easier', 'kids', 'follow', 'along', 'costumes', 'were', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'classical', 'fairytales', 'as', 'well', 'guess', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'bit', 'grief', 'kids', 'buying', 'toys', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'not', 'least', 'other', 'barbie', 'dolls', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'fray', 'Anneliese', 'Erika', 'could', 'be', 'dressed', 'up', 'even', 'rapunzel', 'using', 'Marzipan', 'Nutcracker', 'have', 'themThe', 'animation', 'tis', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'loved', 'way', 'hair', 'moved', 'ice', 'skating', 'scenes', 'instance', 'be', 'getting', 'better', 'movie', 'were', 'good', 'bright', 'colours', '3D', 'great', 'too', 'glasses', 'come', 'are', 'Barbie', 'branded', 'however', 'just', 'watch', 'out', 'littlies', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'keeping', 'noses', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'experimenting', 'everything', 'else', 'house', '4', 'pairs', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'can', 'order', 'more', 'expensive', 'kind', 'novelty', 'think', 'appreicated', 'more', 'did', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'ask', 'Barbie', 'back', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Princess', 'Pauper', 'was', 'great', 'movie']",Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus

I'm a 3D enthusiast so I look at it from a different perspective. The effects for DVD are average and yes red and blue (anaglyph)3D can be disorientating when the film is in color.There's many things that can be done about that but it's up to the consumer to express a demand in quality 3D DVD.If you want good family 3D purchase the Ultimate Imax Collection.This electronic system works with flickering LCD lenses and produces a splendid out of the set 3D experience. The major set backs are that untill the demand for more is expressed the number of titles is limited and for the time being they only work on the tube sets and not plasma or HDTV. THis I hear is being corrected in the near future.Spy kids Game over is now available like this in a special edition and I can assure you the 3D is awesome and far superior to anaglyph. The other nice thing about getting this system is that if you go to Toy,Sci-fi and other conventions you can usually find foreign copies of Movies like HOUSE OF WAX(original) and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE in this format.Under no circumstances get THE ULTIMATE HORROR COLLECTION IN 3D as these movies really suck and they are not kid friendly. There is one other form of 3D available called Pulfrich. It's featured on some kids videos. Basically  it's paper glasses with one clear lens and one dark lens.The major problem with it is  that it wont come out of the screen and it's kind of a rip because once you have the glasses you can keep them because this style of 3d works on any image moving from left to right.

915885,ACC8K30ZFCB0M,B0009X775Y,Lisa Dawn,"[3, 3]","Well, I finally saw this movie on TV, and it was definitely better than Fairytopia, since that one was a huge disappointment.  It still wasn't as good as Princess and the Pauper, which will probably forever be the best Barbie movie, but it wasn't bad.Unlike the other Barbie movies, I thought this one felt the most like an action/adventure video game.  Barbie keeps getting into sticky situations, like having to quest for a jewel, getting stuck in a giant's stew, and escaping from a collapsing dungeon.  She uses her intellect and wit to escape from these situations, but even though it sounds like the storyline would be very choppy because of this, it actually seemed surprising fluid.  That's because she goes on these quests to collect the pieces of one wand that she needs to save her family.I actually could have done without the Pegasus aspect of the movie since it didn't make much sense that her sister was turned into a Pegasus as a teenager before Barbie's character was born, because then her sister would have to be in her 30s now, but I guess most people wouldn't think about that.  The graphics were pretty well-done, and I would look forward to seeing this movie in 3D because I noticed several scenes would look nice in 3D.Overall, it's a lovely movie with a very strong yet very feminine heroine (similar to the other Barbie movies), but I thought that some of the dialogue was very cheesy, and there were a few plotholes.

915893,A29L2RN5D8C0HM,B0009X775Y,"Prism Light ""Prism""","[0, 0]","In ""Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus"", Barbie plays Princess Annika (pronounced on-i-ka).  Annika is a spirited girl with a love for ice skating.  She finds so much enjoyment out of it, that she doesn't understand why her parents (the king and queen) forbid her to do it.  In fact, they don't even want her out of their sight.  One night, Annika becomes very upset with her parents and sneaks out to ice skate.  While she skates with a cheerful crowd, an evil wizard approaches her and commands that she marry him.  Annika refuses and the wizard turns her parents, who have come to rescue her, to stone.  But Annika is momentarily saved from the frightening wizard by a winged horse, who seems to care about Annika, though they have never met before.It is a fun adventure from that point on.  I think it was a neat movie, especially for being a Barbie movie.  I think younger girls will love it, as it contains all of the qualities that little girls love: cute characters, romance (not extreme, mind you) suspense, magic, and a little bit of comedy.  If I were a younger, I know I would be like, ""Mom!  Take me to WAL*MART!  I want the Princess Annika doll!""  Which is not to say that ""I'm too old for it now"".  I thought it was a good movie.  My only comments are that some things are just a bit over the top.  For example, the wizard was supposed to have had 3 past wives, Annika would be his 4th.  I think the multiple wives thing might make some parents a bit uncomfortable.  Also, some of the word exchange between Annika and Aidan (the boy) could be pretty smart-aleck sometimes.  (It's the they-hate-each-other-then-fall-in-love storyline.)

They're few and far between, and frankly, they're downright irritating. Put the 3D glasses back in the box, and put on a helmet, because the moral of the story will be pummeled into your head with Aidan's blacksmith hammer over the next hour or so.Barbie as Princess Annika, voiced by Kelly Sheridan (as she should be!), seems to be an unlikely disciple of the ""YES WE CAN NO MATTER WHAT!""philosophy. She sneaks out of the palace and gives her parents an attitude about being kept there all the time. She says it's not fair, they're ruining her life, et cetera... to be honest this is probably the most realistic Barbie character in any of the movies I've seen. When the quest gets going, she abruptly stops being a spoiled brat and becomes the Tony Robbins of children's video with a relentless touch of the Borg from Star Trek to give it that added annoyance factor. I think I preferred the brat to the unflinching, never ending MESSAGE.Brietta, Barbie's sister turned into a flying horse, is the complete opposite and just as irritating. She wallows in self pity and even when she's been shown that things are not hopeless, she just mopes and whines. All the Barbie movies seem to be this way-- Polly Perfect must teach Negative Nancy some valuable life lessons. I'm sure it's done to make the movie easier for the kids to understand, but when the characters are so extreme, even the kids get tired of it. It would be nice to see two average characters with different strengths teaching each other for once.Ken as Aidan is a bit of a darker character than the men in other Barbie movies, and I kind of like him. He gambled away his parents' money and now he's trying to set things right. If you have a problem with Ken playing poker, I think the important thing to remember is that he regrets what he did, and there were no positive consequences to it. It's also nice that they don't beat you over the head with it, but of course they were too busy doing that with the ""CAN DO YAHOO!!!"" stuff. If there had been text flashing on the screen that said ""Here's the MESSAGE! Don't forget the MESSAGE!"" it would have been less subtle.Wenlock can be downright scary for kids at times, and the polygamy issue could have been avoided without hurting the story at all. I have to wonder if anyone making these movies stops to think about these things first. Even if a kid is familiar with Bible stories where polygamy plays an integral part, it's usually glossed over in children's versions. I don't want to be ambushed with something like this and have to explain it to a young child. These women could have been presented as badly treated servants without affecting the plot or bringing in the multiple marriage issue. Even more disturbing, after they're free, the wives are shown floating off into the sunset with Wenlock, implying that they are staying with an abuser, and that their forced marriages were permanent.With no songs to temper the mood, and the only bright light at the cloud castle, the look and feel of the movie is very dark. The real comic relief comes at the end of the movie with the ""outtakes"" that play during the credits. Mattel (or whoever they pay to make these things) missed the mark on this one by going to too many extremes in too many areas. It's not a horrible movie, but it's made worse by the fact that it could have been really good had the various elements been handled properly. The producers would benefit from someone hammering ""NO YOU CAN'T!"" into THEIR heads a little and learning a lesson of their own.",3,Don't forget the MESSAGE!,1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,3603,"['First', 'all', ""'re"", 'excited', '3D', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', ""'re"", 'few', 'far', 'frankly', ""'re"", 'downright', 'irritating', 'Put', '3D', 'glasses', 'back', 'box', 'put', 'helmet', 'moral', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'pummeled', 'head', 'Aidan', 'blacksmith', 'hammer', 'next', 'hour', 'so.Barbie', 'Princess', 'Annika', 'voiced', 'Kelly', 'Sheridan', 'should', 'be', 'be', 'unlikely', 'disciple', 'WE', 'CAN', 'NO', 'MATTER', 'WHAT', 'philosophy', 'palace', 'parents', 'attitude', 'being', 'kept', 'there', 'time', 'not', 'fair', ""'re"", 'ruining', 'life', 'cetera', 'be', 'honest', 'probably', 'most', 'realistic', 'Barbie', 'character', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'When', 'quest', 'going', 'abruptly', 'being', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'Tony', 'Robbins', 'children', 'video', 'relentless', 'touch', 'Borg', 'Star', 'Trek', 'give', 'added', 'annoyance', 'factor', 'think', 'preferred', 'brat', 'unflinching', 'never', 'ending', 'MESSAGE.Brietta', 'Barbie', 'sister', 'turned', 'flying', 'horse', 'complete', 'opposite', 'just', 'irritating', 'self', 'pity', 'even', 'when', 'been', 'shown', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'hopeless', 'just', 'mopes', 'whines', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'way', 'Polly', 'Perfect', 'must', 'teach', 'Negative', 'Nancy', 'valuable', 'life', 'lessons', ""'m"", 'sure', 'done', 'make', 'movie', 'easier', 'kids', 'understand', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'extreme', 'even', 'kids', 'get', 'tired', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'two', 'average', 'characters', 'different', 'strengths', 'teaching', 'other', 'once.Ken', 'Aidan', 'bit', 'darker', 'character', 'men', 'other', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'kind', 'gambled', 'away', 'parents', 'money', 'now', 'trying', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'have', 'problem', 'Ken', 'playing', 'poker', 'think', 'important', 'thing', 'remember', 'what', 'did', 'were', 'positive', 'consequences', 'also', 'nice', 'do', ""n't"", 'beat', 'head', 'course', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'doing', 'CAN', 'DO', 'YAHOO', 'stuff', 'had', 'been', 'text', 'flashing', 'screen', 'said', 'Here', 'MESSAGE', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'MESSAGE', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'subtle.Wenlock', 'can', 'be', 'downright', 'scary', 'kids', 'times', 'polygamy', 'issue', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'hurting', 'story', 'have', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'making', 'movies', 'stops', 'think', 'things', 'first', 'Even', 'kid', 'familiar', 'Bible', 'stories', 'where', 'polygamy', 'integral', 'part', 'usually', 'glossed', 'over', 'children', 'versions', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'ambushed', 'something', 'have', 'explain', 'young', 'child', 'women', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'badly', 'treated', 'servants', 'affecting', 'plot', 'bringing', 'multiple', 'marriage', 'issue', 'Even', 'more', 'disturbing', ""'re"", 'free', 'wives', 'are', 'shown', 'floating', 'off', 'sunset', 'Wenlock', 'implying', 'are', 'staying', 'abuser', 'forced', 'marriages', 'were', 'permanent.With', 'songs', 'temper', 'mood', 'only', 'bright', 'light', 'cloud', 'castle', 'look', 'feel', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'real', 'comic', 'relief', 'end', 'movie', 'outtakes', 'play', 'credits', 'Mattel', 'whoever', 'pay', 'make', 'things', 'missed', 'mark', 'one', 'going', 'too', 'many', 'extremes', 'too', 'many', 'areas', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'made', 'worse', 'fact', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'had', 'various', 'elements', 'been', 'handled', 'properly', 'producers', 'would', 'benefit', 'someone', 'hammering', 'NO', 'YOU', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'THEIR', 'little', 'learning', 'lesson', 'own']",Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus
