1029064,A1I1GC24YNZJO2,B000JR0BYE,A. Ryan,"[26, 26]","This moving film truly captures the personality, spirit and character of Pope John Paul II thru the two powerful performances by Cary Elwes (""Princess Bride"" fame) as the younger Pope, Karol Wojtyla, and the critically acclaimed performance by Academy Award winner, Jon Voight. Both actors give stellar performances to show the many facets of the Pope's personality and life, from his challenging youth in war torn Poland through his last days in the papacy.Contrary to what another reviewer said about budget limitations, this is actually a big budget movie for television, a 20 million dollar production. It also had a full theatrical release throughout Poland, and had tremendous box office susccess, second only in revenues to ""The Passion of the Christ"". This is a very beautifully filmed production that has a great look to it, shot on location in Rome and Poland.Director John Kent Harrison also wrote the screenplay, after interviewing those who were closest to the Pope, and Harrison just nails the story of the Pope's life so well. Both Elwes and Voight have publicly stated how greatly honored and humbled they were to play JP II, and they both said they worked extremely hard to portray the Pope as best as possible. They both succeeded admirably.Voight was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance, one that Variety called ""remarkable"", and USA Today said ""Voight stands out as he closely mirrors our image of the Pope . . .with a mix of majesty and humility, humor and steel."" Finally, the renowned Peggy Noonan said it was ""Brilliant and warm . .  the best work of Jon Voight's storied career.""I wholeheartedly agree.

I met many Poles who thought that this was one of the greatest living men of the time. Not being Catholic, I had no positive nor negative opinions about him.This year for some reason I became curious about the Pole, so many talked about as being a Saint. I had watched the other film about John Paul's life called, Karol-a man who would become Pope, before watching this film. I thoroughly enjoyed the other film, but felt it ended too early, as his life as Pope was not looked at. Karol left me intrigued to find out more about this man. I stumbled across this title by accident, I had no idea John Voight had made it.This film starts with the assassination attempt May 13th 1981. It then regresses back to 1939 when Karol was living in Kracow and was an Actor and University student. Cary Elwes plays the young Karol. For me the actor Piotr Adamczyk who played Karol in the first film I watched was a far better actor for this role, he was just more believable. The two films look at the same events in general, but present what I thought were facts about his life in different ways. One of the films must be inaccurate, I am not sure which one is which. Once again with this film, a great deal of time is spent looking at his time in Poland and how he became Pope.For me the utter delight of this film is in the second half, when John Voight takes over the role as the Pope. This is done whilst dressing, after his election to the Papacy. If I hadn't have seen the film, the idea of Voight playing John Paul would have sounded strange. All I can say after seeing the film is WOW, he looks and acts just like John Paul. Voight is so believable as Pope. The rest of the film looks at the Pope's life after election and looks at the Polish problem in the 1980's from his eyes. The film ends with his death in 2005.This film is a great portrait of a very great man. I have so much admiration for Karol Wojtyla after watching the two films. This is a made for TV film and does suffer from some low budget special effects, but these do not detract from what is a great biopic film of a great man.",5,Great Biopic Of John Paul,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,2177,"['Between', '1993', '1995', 'lived', 'Lublin', 'Poland', 'where', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'used', 'teach', 'met', 'many', 'Poles', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'living', 'men', 'time', 'Not', 'being', 'Catholic', 'had', 'positive', 'negative', 'opinions', 'him.This', 'year', 'reason', 'became', 'curious', 'Pole', 'so', 'many', 'talked', 'about', 'being', 'Saint', 'had', 'watched', 'other', 'film', 'John', 'Paul', 'life', 'called', 'Karol-a', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'Pope', 'watching', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'film', 'felt', 'ended', 'too', 'early', 'life', 'Pope', 'was', 'not', 'looked', 'Karol', 'left', 'intrigued', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'man', 'stumbled', 'title', 'accident', 'had', 'idea', 'John', 'Voight', 'had', 'made', 'it.This', 'film', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'May', '13th', '1981', 'then', 'back', '1939', 'when', 'Karol', 'was', 'living', 'Kracow', 'was', 'Actor', 'University', 'student', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'young', 'Karol', 'actor', 'Piotr', 'Adamczyk', 'who', 'played', 'Karol', 'first', 'film', 'watched', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'actor', 'role', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'believable', 'two', 'films', 'look', 'same', 'events', 'general', 'present', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'facts', 'life', 'different', 'ways', 'One', 'films', 'must', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'Once', 'again', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'spent', 'looking', 'time', 'Poland', 'how', 'became', 'Pope.For', 'utter', 'delight', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'John', 'Voight', 'role', 'Pope', 'done', 'whilst', 'dressing', 'election', 'Papacy', 'had', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'idea', 'Voight', 'playing', 'John', 'Paul', 'would', 'have', 'sounded', 'strange', 'can', 'say', 'seeing', 'film', 'WOW', 'just', 'like', 'John', 'Paul', 'Voight', 'so', 'believable', 'Pope', 'rest', 'film', 'Pope', 'life', 'election', 'Polish', 'problem', '1980', 'eyes', 'film', 'death', '2005.This', 'film', 'great', 'portrait', 'very', 'great', 'man', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'admiration', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'watching', 'two', 'films', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'suffer', 'low', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'what', 'great', 'biopic', 'film', 'great', 'man']",N/A
1029068,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000JR0BYE,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[6, 14]","This interesting and admittedly riveting film--with a few big yawns in the middle--is incredibly moving with Jon Voigt (AN AMERICAN CAROL, NATIONAL TREASURE 2) taking over the lead role from Carey Elwes. It was a strong, Vatican-approved biopic and of course another pathetic biopic was stupidly pitted against this one at the time it was televised.Elwes gives a pretty smashing performance as a youthful His Holiness, but in fact he strains as he tries so hard to show us a young Father Wojtyla age into a senior bishop. None of the other performers in this film show that immense unprofessional strain. Elwes annoys all the more because he's more than a good half of the nearly 3-hour film.Passing to the other actors and storyline: this purports to be a film based on the life of Pope John Paul II, yet what is refuses to show the viewer is as telling as the film. Did you know the Pope's mother came from a converted Jewish family? Did you know he was raised in Jewish neighborhoods, had only Jewish friends as a kid and may have had secretly practicing Jewish relatives?Did you know he was roundly and loudly booed on his trip to Columbia in the 1980s? He actually banged his fist and shouted at the crowd to shut up...he was a man with a temper on him. I know. I was there.Aside from a sort of rambling mess of a story, which on other occasions I might have said was smooth streamlining, we have the spectacular performances of James Cromwell as Prince Adam Cardinal Sapieha (who was also a prince), and Christopher Lee as Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski. The great Ben Gazzara, here obviously recovered from a stroke, plays a stunning Augustino Cardinal Cassaroli.For some odd reason, everyone else in this film consists of EuroUnknowns. That's perfectly OK with me, but I hate all the voice dubbing. There are some famous but not easily recognizable voices dubbed over never-before-seen faces. And I guess my point is that it's too much to have to wade through all this to enjoy the film.Anything with cooperation of the Vatican will have been meddled with by same...and this film shows it. Ben Gazzara has done these kinds of things before, but the movie bears the unbearable stamp of people who know nothing about good film.This thing could have been SO much better.",3,"Karol Wojtyla, Meet Jon Voigt",1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,2270,"['interesting', 'admittedly', 'riveting', 'film', 'few', 'big', 'yawns', 'middle', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'Jon', 'Voigt', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'CAROL', 'NATIONAL', 'TREASURE', '2', 'taking', 'lead', 'role', 'Carey', 'Elwes', 'was', 'strong', 'Vatican-approved', 'biopic', 'course', 'pathetic', 'biopic', 'was', 'stupidly', 'pitted', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'televised.Elwes', 'pretty', 'smashing', 'performance', 'youthful', 'Holiness', 'fact', 'so', 'hard', 'show', 'young', 'Father', 'Wojtyla', 'age', 'senior', 'bishop', 'None', 'other', 'performers', 'film', 'show', 'immense', 'unprofessional', 'strain', 'Elwes', 'more', 'more', 'good', 'half', 'nearly', '3-hour', 'film.Passing', 'other', 'actors', 'storyline', 'be', 'film', 'based', 'life', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'yet', 'what', 'show', 'viewer', 'as', 'telling', 'film', 'Did', 'know', 'Pope', 'mother', 'came', 'converted', 'Jewish', 'family', 'Did', 'know', 'was', 'raised', 'Jewish', 'neighborhoods', 'had', 'only', 'Jewish', 'friends', 'kid', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'secretly', 'practicing', 'Jewish', 'relatives', 'Did', 'know', 'was', 'roundly', 'loudly', 'booed', 'trip', 'Columbia', '1980s', 'actually', 'banged', 'fist', 'shouted', 'crowd', 'shut', 'up', 'was', 'man', 'temper', 'know', 'was', 'there.Aside', 'sort', 'rambling', 'mess', 'story', 'other', 'occasions', 'might', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'smooth', 'streamlining', 'have', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'Cardinal', 'Sapieha', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'prince', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Stefan', 'Cardinal', 'Wyszynski', 'great', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'here', 'obviously', 'recovered', 'stroke', 'stunning', 'Augustino', 'Cardinal', 'Cassaroli.For', 'odd', 'reason', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'EuroUnknowns', 'perfectly', 'OK', 'hate', 'voice', 'dubbing', 'are', 'famous', 'not', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'voices', 'dubbed', 'never-before-seen', 'guess', 'point', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'wade', 'enjoy', 'film.Anything', 'cooperation', 'Vatican', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'meddled', 'same', 'film', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'done', 'kinds', 'things', 'movie', 'unbearable', 'stamp', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'about', 'good', 'film.This', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'SO', 'much', 'better']",N/A

His Holiness Pope John Paul II (Jon Voight) is greeted by well-wishers. Today, he will greet the visitors outside The Vatican on St. Peter's Square. While standing in the mobile driving by slowly, he touches the hands of some visitors. Suddenly, a Turkish man, Mehmet Ali Agca, raises his arm and shoots a gun at His Holiness. Pope John Paul II is struck by four bullets. At the same time, a nun is screaming in horror as the arm with the gun is in front of her. She quickly pushes down the man's arm and gun. The Pope says he was hit in the stomach. He is loosing blood fast. As he is laying there, he sees a vision or a memory of his mother teaching him how to pray. He is immediately taken to the hospital.The movie now recalls the life of the Pope when he was a young man in Poland. His name is Karol Wojtyla (Cary Elwes). The movie goes from September 1939 to when he becomes a priest and then a Bishop at the age of 38. Then on to his election to the papacy on October 16, 1978. The story continues again with Jon Voight as ""Pope John Paul II"".Ben Gazzara as ""Cardinal Agostino Casaroli.James cromwell as ""Archbishop Adam Stefan Sapieha""Christopher Lee as ""Cardinal Agostino Casaroli""Mikolaj Grabowski as ""Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany"".Special Features:World Premiere Screening at The Vatican with Pope Benedict XVI.Memories of the Pope.Making of the movie.3 Deleted scenes.Fact: Pope John Paul II passed away April 2, 2005.

Bush, former President Bill Clinton, the current President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush, Condoleezza Rice and Andrew Card were in attendance.On April 4, with The Papal Gentlemen, he was officiated the asperges rite. This was followed by a long procession to transfer the body from Clementine Hall through the colonnades of the Apostolic Palace and outside into St. Peter's Square.The Mass of Requiem was held outside on April 8, led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.It was the very first Mass of Requiem to ever be televised and all over the world.The conclave began in the Sistine Chapel with the College of Cardinals on April 18. The black smoke appeared that evening. It meant the paper card ballots were being burned. They had not reached a final decision. The next morning of April 19, twice the black smoke appeared again, however by the  afternoon the white smoke appeared. The election was finished. However, the bells of St. Peter's Basilica did not ring. Was this forgotten?Eventually the bells did peal.  The people had gathered at St. Peter's Square.

Gary (as the young Karol) gives  veritable insight to the future Pope's young life and the struggles of living in Poland during the Nazi invasion of his beloved Poland. Gary's performance shows Karol's love of his friends caught in the revolution of the times and his love of God, ultimately leading him to choose the priesthood. Jon Voight's performance is equally if not better, in so far as we now get to know the interesting details Pope's life, his challenges, how he dealt with the assassination attempt and his good works during his long papacy. Whomever cast Voight for this role, knew what they were doing. At some points, Voight's physical appearance and actions makes one believe they are actually looking at the real John ii.

As a young man facing the Nazi invasion of his homeland he expresses the theme of his life saying that such an abyss of hate can only be met with an equal abyss of love.  Becoming a priest in defiance of the Nazi followed by Communist authorities, he planted the seeds that would lead that country to freedom once again.  As Pope he stood up for what was right and encouraged non-violent resistance as the tool of revolution.  His homilies on the what he called, ""the theology of the body"" gave the logical and inspiring defense of human sexuality based on dignity and respect for human life.  A man unimpressed with the difficulty of the cause so long as the cause was just and the methods of fighting for it did not contradict the dignity of mankind, his impact on the world will ripple out to the centuries that follow.  He was a hero worthy of imitation and veneration.

1029080,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B000JR0BYE,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This is not a dull historical biography or religious hagiography, but a passionate human story that reaches straight to your heart. Without silliness or exaggeration, ""Pope John Paul II"" tells the very human story of an ordinary man who responded to the immense sufferings of his life with an extraordinary love that never wavered. There are heartbreaking moments in this film that are so real and understated they will bring tears to your eyes. Karol Wojtyla's mother and older brother (his only sibling) were both dead by the time he was 12. Raised by his single dad, who was a retired army sergeant, he studied theater and philosophy at Krakow's Jagiellonian University, where the German invasion of Poland forced him at age 19 to seek out manual labor in a quarry after the Nazis closed his school. Then his dad died in 1942 and he was left alone in the world. After doing underground theater productions for a little while, he chose to enter an underground seminary, studying secretly for the priesthood during the German occupation. After the war he became a priest, bishop and cardinal, fighting the Communists who had taken over Poland and declared war on religious freedom. After being elected pope at age 58 in 1978, he took the name John Paul II and became a major player on the world stage, helping to topple Soviet Communism and fight for human rights over the course of the next 26 years before he gradually withered away under the onslaught of Parkinson's disease. He was an actor and athlete who loved crowds, but he was also one of the great figures in human history. Due to the modern media, I have read that more people saw John Paul II in person or on camera than any other figure in human history, and his public funeral in April 2005 was a major world event. This film does justice to these events in his life with a first-rate cast (including James Cromwell and Christopher Lee) and location shooting that extends from Poland to Rome. Recreations of big historical moments like the WWII invasion of Poland and the papal conclave of 1978 are incredibly well depicted without any hint of staginess. Both Cary Elwes (as the younger Karol Wojtyla) and Jon Voight (as Karol after he is elected pope) are exceptional as John Paul II, channeling his public persona so well that you sometimes forget you are watching actors. They are especially good at evoking the evolution of Karol Wojtyla from his humble origins to the leader of 1 billion Catholics worldwide. Don't be fooled by the other films on John Paul II: This is the only one that is worthwhile. The made-for-TV productions ""Have No Fear"" (ABC) and ""Karol: The Man, The Pope"" (including its prequel) pale in comparison to this heartwarming film. Unlike those productions, this movie (originally aired on CBS) does not merely depict events in the manner of a high school social studies report, but inspires faith in human nature. This is not a film to be missed. Short of meeting the real John Paul II, or seeing one of the better documentaries on his life, this 3-hour telepic is as good as it gets. To people of all faiths and none, I cannot recommend it enough.",5,You'll be crying by the end,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,3139,"['not', 'dull', 'historical', 'biography', 'religious', 'hagiography', 'passionate', 'human', 'story', 'straight', 'heart', 'silliness', 'exaggeration', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'very', 'human', 'story', 'ordinary', 'man', 'who', 'responded', 'immense', 'sufferings', 'life', 'extraordinary', 'love', 'never', 'wavered', 'are', 'heartbreaking', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'understated', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'mother', 'older', 'brother', 'only', 'sibling', 'were', 'dead', 'time', 'was', '12', 'Raised', 'single', 'dad', 'who', 'was', 'retired', 'army', 'sergeant', 'studied', 'theater', 'philosophy', 'Krakow', 'Jagiellonian', 'University', 'where', 'German', 'invasion', 'Poland', 'forced', 'age', '19', 'seek', 'out', 'manual', 'labor', 'quarry', 'Nazis', 'closed', 'school', 'Then', 'dad', 'died', '1942', 'was', 'left', 'alone', 'world', 'doing', 'underground', 'theater', 'productions', 'little', 'while', 'chose', 'enter', 'underground', 'seminary', 'studying', 'secretly', 'priesthood', 'German', 'occupation', 'war', 'became', 'priest', 'bishop', 'cardinal', 'fighting', 'Communists', 'who', 'had', 'taken', 'Poland', 'declared', 'war', 'religious', 'freedom', 'being', 'elected', 'pope', 'age', '58', '1978', 'took', 'name', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'became', 'major', 'player', 'world', 'stage', 'helping', 'topple', 'Soviet', 'Communism', 'fight', 'human', 'rights', 'course', 'next', '26', 'years', 'gradually', 'withered', 'away', 'onslaught', 'Parkinson', 'disease', 'was', 'actor', 'athlete', 'who', 'loved', 'crowds', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'great', 'figures', 'human', 'history', 'Due', 'modern', 'media', 'have', 'read', 'more', 'people', 'saw', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'person', 'camera', 'other', 'figure', 'human', 'history', 'public', 'funeral', 'April', '2005', 'was', 'major', 'world', 'event', 'film', 'justice', 'events', 'life', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'including', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'location', 'shooting', 'Poland', 'Rome', 'Recreations', 'big', 'historical', 'moments', 'WWII', 'invasion', 'Poland', 'papal', 'conclave', '1978', 'are', 'incredibly', 'well', 'depicted', 'hint', 'staginess', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'younger', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Karol', 'elected', 'pope', 'are', 'exceptional', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'channeling', 'public', 'persona', 'so', 'well', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'actors', 'are', 'especially', 'good', 'evoking', 'evolution', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'humble', 'origins', 'leader', '1', 'billion', 'Catholics', 'worldwide', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'other', 'films', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'only', 'one', 'worthwhile', 'made-for-TV', 'productions', 'Have', 'Fear', 'ABC', 'Karol', 'Man', 'Pope', 'including', 'prequel', 'pale', 'comparison', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'productions', 'movie', 'originally', 'aired', 'CBS', 'not', 'merely', 'depict', 'events', 'manner', 'high', 'school', 'social', 'studies', 'report', 'faith', 'human', 'nature', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'missed', 'Short', 'meeting', 'real', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'seeing', 'one', 'better', 'documentaries', 'life', '3-hour', 'telepic', 'as', 'good', 'people', 'faiths', 'none', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'enough']",N/A
