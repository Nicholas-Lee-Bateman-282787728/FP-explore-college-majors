So when I saw this new series by LMM, priced relatively inexpensively, I decided to purchase season one.  I loved it enough to purchase season two, which I just finished watching.  I didn't want it to end!  Although I was getting impatient with Laura's decompensation after the death of Elizabeth for the first two or three episodes of season two, I also realized that such a reaction was understandable and realistic, given her character.  Nevertheless, I was relieved when she rebounded and, although I disliked Isabel (""Lucifer"") at first, as the ice in her melted I grew to appreciate her just as I grew to appreciate Elizabeth as she warmed up to Emily.  Each episode was different and kept my interest.  Just as Anne of Green Gables (the Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst version) had a strong ensemble cast, so does this new series.  I'm eager for season three (when will it arive?) so I can find out whether Laura marries Ian Bowles or Ilsa's dad, whether Jimmy ends up with Eve, whether Isabel ends up with the teacher, and if Malcolm marries ""Jezebel.""  Oh, yes, and I want to see how Ilsa and Emily mature from girls into adolescents and young adults (I assume Emily does become a writer but does Emily end up remaining single or marrying her cousin, Perry, or Teddy?  Does Ilsa marry Perry who she's always fighting with?).  So, if any producers are reading these reviews, please...don't end with season three!! I look forward to many more seasons of this wonderful Emilia of Nuova Luna!",5,I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON THREE!!!,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,1799,"['loved', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'fell', 'love', 'PEI', 'when', 'visited', 'first', 'time', 'August', '2007', 'highlight', 'was', 'visit', 'house', 'north', 'central', 'coast', 'tour', 'here', 'where', 'Lucy', 'Maude', 'Montgomery', 'lived', 'where', 'met', 'one', 'descendents', 'when', 'saw', 'new', 'series', 'LMM', 'priced', 'relatively', 'inexpensively', 'decided', 'purchase', 'season', 'one', 'loved', 'enough', 'purchase', 'season', 'two', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'was', 'getting', 'impatient', 'Laura', 'decompensation', 'death', 'Elizabeth', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'season', 'two', 'also', 'realized', 'reaction', 'was', 'understandable', 'realistic', 'given', 'character', 'Nevertheless', 'was', 'relieved', 'when', 'rebounded', 'disliked', 'Isabel', 'Lucifer', 'first', 'ice', 'melted', 'grew', 'appreciate', 'just', 'grew', 'appreciate', 'Elizabeth', 'warmed', 'up', 'Emily', 'episode', 'was', 'different', 'kept', 'interest', 'Just', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'version', 'had', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'so', 'new', 'series', ""'m"", 'eager', 'season', 'three', 'when', 'will', 'arive', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'Laura', 'marries', 'Ian', 'Bowles', 'Ilsa', 'dad', 'Jimmy', 'up', 'Eve', 'Isabel', 'up', 'teacher', 'Malcolm', 'Jezebel', 'Oh', 'yes', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'Ilsa', 'Emily', 'mature', 'girls', 'adolescents', 'young', 'adults', 'assume', 'Emily', 'become', 'writer', 'Emily', 'end', 'up', 'remaining', 'single', 'marrying', 'cousin', 'Perry', 'Teddy', 'Does', 'Ilsa', 'marry', 'Perry', 'who', 'always', 'fighting', 'So', 'producers', 'are', 'reading', 'reviews', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'season', 'three', 'look', 'forward', 'many', 'more', 'seasons', 'wonderful', 'Emilia', 'Nuova', 'Luna']",N/A
