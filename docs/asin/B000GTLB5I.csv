It comes in a cool box and the seasons are divided in half in 2 sleeves with duct tape graphics, but both the box and sleeves are cheaply made. The set has all the seasons and the 2 movies that came out in '94 in believe. I really don't remember a lot of the episodes from the first 2 seasons but as I got further into the show I started seeing familiar scenes. This was one of the really good shows, and would be great for families since they really don't show a lot of blood, Mac doesn't drink or smoke, or curse.

""MacGyver"" isn't one of them.  Just about any episode from any season is enough to remind me why I loved going along for the ride back then, and I still do.Of course, I knew even as a teenager that he was a bit goody goody - ordering milk at a bar, never eating junk food, trying to reason gently with an ex-girlfriend who just tried to murder him, and yet he doesn't always wear his seatbelt - but it's all part of the fun.  So are the occasional plot holes, which of course are a bit more noticeable this time around.  I also seem to recall thinking as a kid that the show became less about gadgets and more about teaching life lessons in later seasons, but I now see that even the earliest episodes often had morality issues and the later seasons still had quite a bit of gadgetry to their credit.  It's really a pretty consistent formula across all seven seasons.The only problem with this set is that, if you're a fan, chances are you already bought at least a few other seasons separately.

My main complaint is the amount of discs and the non-standard (LARGE) boxes used for most series. Sure, it looks nice in the store and online, but it sure doesn't fit nicely on a shelf with the rest of your DVD collection. Try putting a couple ""complete series"" box sets on a shelf and see how quickly it starts to look ridiculous!I prefer buying individual seasons, which fit nicely on a shelf (with the rest of my collection) and ussually have better packaging. Remember that some of the ""whole season"" box sets either have the discs laying on top of each other (loose) or simply sliding into little notches in cardboard (which scratches the discs).The true answer for whole season sets will be the increased capacity of the BLU-RAY format.

I have all 7 seasons, and am waiting for the 2 TV movies to be put out.  Now they are coming out with the entire series, which is supposed to include the tv movies, but no seperate release of the TV movies.  I am mad.  They should give us the tv movies seperately as several people paid out good money for each season release.  Boo Paramount!!I just saw this set at Target.  Yes folks, the tv movies are in the complete series set.  Again, why not release the movies seperately as well?",2,why no seperate dvd of the tv movies?,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,555,"['bought', 'season', 'show', 'as', 'soon', 'came', 'out', 'have', '7', 'seasons', 'am', 'waiting', '2', 'TV', 'movies', 'be', 'put', 'out', 'Now', 'are', 'coming', 'out', 'entire', 'series', 'supposed', 'include', 'tv', 'movies', 'seperate', 'release', 'TV', 'movies', 'am', 'mad', 'should', 'give', 'tv', 'movies', 'seperately', 'several', 'people', 'paid', 'out', 'good', 'money', 'season', 'release', 'Boo', 'Paramount', 'just', 'saw', 'set', 'Target', 'Yes', 'folks', 'tv', 'movies', 'are', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'Again', 'why', 'not', 'release', 'movies', 'seperately', 'well']",N/A
