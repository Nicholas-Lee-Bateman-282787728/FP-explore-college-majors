This movie was also close to the book, where as some of the other movies veered to far from the book.

747737,A2WFNNKUK3OC2X,B00008W2QT,T. Winston,"[1, 2]","This film was pretty good but it was too predictable.  It was your typical fatal attraction movie but it didn't have you guessing.  The main character, Jackson, had a small fling with a female coworker before he got married.  Little does he know that she has an agenda up her sleeve for the two of them.  First of all, in the beginning when Jackson's wife got murdered, I had a hunch that the (other) woman was the suspect.  Sometimes that's the case when another woman wants another woman's man and is obsessed.  They really had that Jackson guy acting clueless.  Especially towards the end when he said ""so you're the one who killed my wife"".  I was like duh.  All the signs were there.  Showing up at his house unannounced all the time, demanding to spend time with him and forcing him to marry her.  I was like something should have went off in his head that this woman was nuts.This wasn't a bad movie, I just wished the plot was more complex  and kind of played tricks with your mind like most movies do.  It was just too simple and you always had a feeling of what was going to happen next.  I'm not saying that you should waste time seeing this movie because it did have suspense.  It's kind of worth seeing.",3,It was okay,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,1216,"['film', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'too', 'predictable', 'was', 'typical', 'fatal', 'attraction', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'guessing', 'main', 'character', 'Jackson', 'had', 'small', 'fling', 'female', 'coworker', 'got', 'married', 'Little', 'know', 'agenda', 'up', 'sleeve', 'two', 'First', 'beginning', 'when', 'Jackson', 'wife', 'got', 'murdered', 'had', 'hunch', 'other', 'woman', 'was', 'suspect', 'case', 'when', 'woman', 'woman', 'man', 'obsessed', 'really', 'had', 'Jackson', 'guy', 'acting', 'clueless', 'Especially', 'end', 'when', 'said', 'so', ""'re"", 'one', 'who', 'killed', 'wife', 'was', 'duh', 'signs', 'were', 'there', 'Showing', 'up', 'house', 'unannounced', 'time', 'demanding', 'spend', 'time', 'forcing', 'marry', 'was', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'went', 'off', 'head', 'woman', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'wished', 'plot', 'was', 'more', 'complex', 'kind', 'played', 'tricks', 'mind', 'most', 'movies', 'do', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'simple', 'always', 'had', 'feeling', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', 'waste', 'time', 'seeing', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'suspense', 'kind', 'worth', 'seeing']",Hidden Blessings

She was a little on the heavy (Thick) side but as you know, some of us like em like that. :-) Along with that it had a good storyline and the drama was captivating. So fellahs, get this one to watch with your lady, she'll like the story and you get ""eye-candy"".
