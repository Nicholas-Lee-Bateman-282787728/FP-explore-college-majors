710291,A39PGE3IDI0VY6,B00006AUJG,"A. KAPLAN ""Penelopecat""","[22, 27]","In a small town, a comic book collector passes away, leaving a phenomenal collection in the hands of his elderly mother.  The owners of the town's two rival comic book stores hear about it, and become obsessed with acquiring the collection.  For Raymond (Donal Logue), whose entire life revolves around comics, the collection represents a dream, a chance to be taken seriously and remembered by his peers.  For Norman (Michael Rappaport) and Judy (Natasha Lyonne), it's all about the money.  Teenage fanboy Archie (DJ Qualls) just wants to see his friend Raymond happy.  And the shady, mysterious Carter (Cary Elwes)?  Who knows his true motivation?What starts out as a whimsical tale of oddball obsession takes a very dark turn about 2/3 of the way through, when everything goes horribly wrong.  It is to writer/director James Robinson's credit that he keeps the viewer onboard, despite this tremendous shift in tone.  We can see him bring the characters to the brink of madness, so the transition feels more natural, and not completely forced.I should point out that I am a huge comics fan, and have known people just like the ones in the movie.  (Though I'd like to think I'm more Archie than Raymond.)  I have been a fan of James Robinson's work for years, and eagerly awaited this, his first feature film as writer and director.  This film provides an interesting counterpoint to the tales of collecting and nostalgia presented in his Starman series.  Overall, his message is a little heavy-handed (Interest Good, Obsession Bad), but he manages to create mostly fleshed-out characters through his customary clever dialogue.  There are lots of insider references to comics, but viewers unfamiliar with comics shouldn't be put off any more than non-doctor viewers are put off by the medical terminology in a typical episode of ER.  The detail just helps illustrate how much the comics mean to the characters, which in turn helps explain why this particular collection is so important.The actors bring the characters to life in a believable fashion.  The real surprise for me was Cary Elwes, who I generally think of in stick-up-his-wazoo, pretty-boy roles like in Twister or his recent turn on X-Files.  Here, he manages to play a nasty two-bit, low-life punk with some edge, and I almost didn't recognize him.  It's a low-budget, independent film, but a cast of names we recognize from other films give it some prestige.This won't be the last movie we'll see written by James Robinson; his screenplay based on Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is already being filmed.  Hopefully, this won't be the last we'll see of his direction, either.  It's too dark and nasty a film to be called charming, and the message is a little too obvious and not particularly clever, but it's very watchable, and I enjoyed it.",4,The Pulp Fiction of comic book movies,1031356800,"09 7, 2002",2002,2823,"['small', 'town', 'comic', 'book', 'collector', 'away', 'leaving', 'phenomenal', 'collection', 'hands', 'elderly', 'mother', 'owners', 'town', 'two', 'rival', 'comic', 'book', 'stores', 'hear', 'become', 'obsessed', 'acquiring', 'collection', 'Raymond', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'entire', 'life', 'revolves', 'comics', 'collection', 'dream', 'chance', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'remembered', 'peers', 'Norman', 'Michael', 'Rappaport', 'Judy', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', 'money', 'Teenage', 'fanboy', 'Archie', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'just', 'see', 'friend', 'Raymond', 'happy', 'shady', 'mysterious', 'Carter', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Who', 'true', 'motivation', 'What', 'out', 'whimsical', 'tale', 'oddball', 'obsession', 'very', 'dark', 'turn', '2/3', 'way', 'when', 'everything', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'writer/director', 'James', 'Robinson', 'credit', 'viewer', 'onboard', 'tremendous', 'shift', 'tone', 'can', 'see', 'bring', 'characters', 'brink', 'madness', 'transition', 'more', 'natural', 'not', 'completely', 'forced.I', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'am', 'huge', 'comics', 'fan', 'have', 'known', 'people', 'just', 'ones', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', ""'m"", 'more', 'Archie', 'Raymond', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'James', 'Robinson', 'work', 'years', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'film', 'interesting', 'counterpoint', 'tales', 'collecting', 'nostalgia', 'presented', 'Starman', 'series', 'Overall', 'message', 'little', 'heavy-handed', 'Interest', 'Good', 'Obsession', 'Bad', 'create', 'mostly', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'customary', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'are', 'lots', 'insider', 'references', 'comics', 'viewers', 'unfamiliar', 'comics', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'more', 'non-doctor', 'viewers', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'medical', 'terminology', 'typical', 'episode', 'ER', 'detail', 'just', 'illustrate', 'how', 'much', 'comics', 'mean', 'characters', 'turn', 'explain', 'why', 'particular', 'collection', 'so', 'important.The', 'actors', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'believable', 'fashion', 'real', 'surprise', 'was', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'who', 'generally', 'think', 'stick-up-his-wazoo', 'pretty-boy', 'roles', 'Twister', 'recent', 'turn', 'X-Files', 'Here', 'play', 'nasty', 'two-bit', 'low-life', 'punk', 'edge', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'cast', 'names', 'recognize', 'other', 'films', 'give', 'prestige.This', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'written', 'James', 'Robinson', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'already', 'being', 'filmed', 'Hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', ""'ll"", 'see', 'direction', 'either', 'too', 'dark', 'nasty', 'film', 'be', 'called', 'charming', 'message', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'not', 'particularly', 'clever', 'very', 'watchable', 'enjoyed']",Comic Book Villains

The only problem is the man's elderly mother refuses to sell them.

As a comic book fan myself I would like to point out that it is the comic book dealers who are depicted this way not the collectors themselves. And any collector I know has sort of a love/hate relationship with comic book dealers. From my experience a lot of comic book dealers are in fact greedy people who offer collectors a penny for every dollar worth of comic books you try to sell to them so this film was enjoyable for me. I also enjoyed the idea of a big mint condition collection of silver and golden age comic books being discovered. This is every comic book fans dream come true. I enjoyed the actors in this film. This is a fun black comedy not to be taken too seriously. Once again I find it odd that some fans object to the violence in this film since most comic books deal with a lot of violence all the time. And in real life let's face it there are a lot of loser, bitter comic book collectors (not all or even most of course) who take their hobby way too seriously. The message of this film is that comic books are fun but there is more to life than comic books and you should get out of the comic book store and go explore what the rest of the world and life has to offer.

710295,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00006AUJG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","COMIC BOOK VILLAINS (2002, 92 minutes) is a quietly black comedy about the insanity of comic book collectors. It is definitely not geared toward children and certainly written so as to titillate the full-grown comic collector. At least at first - because I can't tell if this film is a morality tale or simply an excuse to produce yet another cheap, ill-tempered violent film that shows our ugliest sides.Two comic book shop owners (my favorite Donal Logue and Michael Rapaport) who are quasi-archenemies hear about an impossibly perfect comics collection, left by a deceased 65-year-old recluse. Thrown into this mix is one of my all-time favorite film stars, DJ Qualls, as Archie (the pun is intended), an innocent, intelligent friend of one of the store owners.The two store owners go nuts attempting to find a way to persuade the deceased man's elderly mother (the immortal Eileen Brennan) to sell the collection. By my very lousy estimation, that collection's worth is approximately a quarter of a million, but I'll never swear by that. Finally, in an off twist I couldn't begin to comprehend is Cary Elwes as a mysterious character who seems to have a comic book past - but he definitely does not have an actual comic book present. He does, however, play the role of The Villain Among Villains. Wait and see.In somebody's excellent review of this film, I read that the writer's original ending was scrapped for some reason. Then they did not even bother to attempt to match up the new ending with the original film. I can see that clearly, but I thought it looked so contrived that I myself cannot attribute that to pure accident. It looked like it was their intention all along.Another great reviewer said, why decry this violence when comics are so violent? - to which I urbanely thought, ""Amen."" To all who said this film was terrible, I say ""Agreed,"" but I love DJ Qualls and Eileen Brennan makes anything shine. At least those two and the brilliant Donal Logue did their duty.What this film made me ponder is my own comic book past. I have owned and have lost all of several collections that might have left me a millionaire today. From ""Batman"" to Morbius the vampire, from ""Spiderman"" to the Walt Disney comics featuring Scrooge McDuck (which I got exclusively in Mexico, because my collections spanned the globe).My parents tried for years to track down that one collection. My other collections, well, when we were kids we used comic books (in the movie the old lady says ""funny books"" and sometimes we called them that) as currency, as bribes, for trades, everything normal kids do. We did not hoard them or live in them - we lived according to what we learned from them. We also outgrew them. Once we outgrew them, they meant little to us. I speak from bitterness since I now know how much money I could have made from them, had I kept them mint. But, I WAS A KID.This movie definitely brought back to memory the love of comics-for-comics-sake, the excitement of a new comic. When I said my bedtime prayers, I prayed FOR Stan Lee and Bob Kane ... not TO them. I prayed for a new comic for my birthday ... I didn't pray that I'd wake up in Gotham City as Batman anymore than I prayed I'd be a wealthy old comic collector.Collectors have love; those who were lucky enough to realize fortunes from collections were those who inherited them. For those who collected with love, there was no money involved if you take my meaning. The point is, there is loving something, collecting it for that reason, learning along the way - and then there is sick obsession that is the sibling of greed.Comics were never, ever about greed - and this film shows in a terrible, dark way how greed definitely drives people insane.",2,"Like any comic, you must ultimately decide how many stars this is worth to you",1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,3725,"['COMIC', 'BOOK', 'VILLAINS', '2002', '92', 'minutes', 'quietly', 'black', 'comedy', 'insanity', 'comic', 'book', 'collectors', 'definitely', 'not', 'geared', 'children', 'certainly', 'written', 'so', 'titillate', 'full-grown', 'comic', 'collector', 'least', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'film', 'morality', 'tale', 'simply', 'excuse', 'produce', 'yet', 'cheap', 'ill-tempered', 'violent', 'film', 'ugliest', 'sides.Two', 'comic', 'book', 'shop', 'owners', 'favorite', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'who', 'are', 'quasi-archenemies', 'hear', 'impossibly', 'perfect', 'comics', 'collection', 'left', 'deceased', '65-year-old', 'recluse', 'Thrown', 'mix', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'film', 'stars', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'Archie', 'pun', 'intended', 'innocent', 'intelligent', 'friend', 'one', 'store', 'owners.The', 'two', 'store', 'owners', 'go', 'nuts', 'attempting', 'find', 'way', 'persuade', 'deceased', 'man', 'elderly', 'mother', 'immortal', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'sell', 'collection', 'very', 'lousy', 'estimation', 'collection', 'worth', 'approximately', 'quarter', 'million', ""'ll"", 'never', 'swear', 'Finally', 'twist', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'comprehend', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'mysterious', 'character', 'who', 'have', 'comic', 'book', 'definitely', 'not', 'have', 'actual', 'comic', 'book', 'present', 'however', 'play', 'role', 'Villain', 'Villains', 'Wait', 'see.In', 'somebody', 'excellent', 'review', 'film', 'read', 'writer', 'original', 'ending', 'was', 'scrapped', 'reason', 'Then', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'bother', 'attempt', 'match', 'up', 'new', 'ending', 'original', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'clearly', 'thought', 'looked', 'so', 'contrived', 'can', 'not', 'attribute', 'pure', 'accident', 'looked', 'was', 'intention', 'along.Another', 'great', 'reviewer', 'said', 'why', 'decry', 'violence', 'when', 'comics', 'are', 'so', 'violent', 'urbanely', 'thought', 'Amen', 'who', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'terrible', 'say', 'Agreed', 'love', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'anything', 'shine', 'least', 'two', 'brilliant', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'did', 'duty.What', 'film', 'made', 'ponder', 'own', 'comic', 'book', 'have', 'owned', 'have', 'lost', 'several', 'collections', 'might', 'have', 'left', 'millionaire', 'today', 'Batman', 'Morbius', 'vampire', 'Spiderman', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'comics', 'featuring', 'Scrooge', 'McDuck', 'got', 'exclusively', 'Mexico', 'collections', 'spanned', 'globe', 'parents', 'tried', 'years', 'track', 'down', 'one', 'collection', 'other', 'collections', 'well', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'used', 'comic', 'books', 'movie', 'old', 'lady', 'funny', 'books', 'sometimes', 'called', 'currency', 'bribes', 'trades', 'everything', 'normal', 'kids', 'do', 'did', 'not', 'hoard', 'live', 'lived', 'according', 'what', 'learned', 'also', 'outgrew', 'outgrew', 'meant', 'little', 'speak', 'bitterness', 'now', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'had', 'kept', 'mint', 'WAS', 'KID.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'brought', 'back', 'memory', 'love', 'comics-for-comics-sake', 'excitement', 'new', 'comic', 'When', 'said', 'bedtime', 'prayers', 'prayed', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Bob', 'Kane', 'not', 'TO', 'prayed', 'new', 'comic', 'birthday', 'did', ""n't"", 'pray', ""'d"", 'wake', 'up', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Batman', 'prayed', ""'d"", 'be', 'wealthy', 'old', 'comic', 'collector.Collectors', 'have', 'love', 'who', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'realize', 'fortunes', 'collections', 'were', 'who', 'inherited', 'who', 'collected', 'love', 'was', 'money', 'involved', 'take', 'meaning', 'point', 'loving', 'something', 'collecting', 'reason', 'learning', 'way', 'then', 'sick', 'obsession', 'sibling', 'greed.Comics', 'were', 'never', 'ever', 'greed', 'film', 'terrible', 'dark', 'way', 'how', 'greed', 'definitely', 'people', 'insane']",Comic Book Villains

In a movie about obsessive comic book fans and collectors, it sums up the banality of the obsession.  COMIC BOOK VILLAINS starts out in a fairly light vein, with some funny scenes and then turns bleakly dark, and by the end of the movie, you feel like you need Prozac.  Another lesser known film, STRANGER THAN FICTION, did this funny to horrifying segue, and it worked.  Somehow COMIC BOOK VILLAINS doesn't make this transition as easily.  Donal Logue as the totally obsessed Raymond starts out rather cool, then almost zany in his obsession, but by the end, his murderous rage totally disengages him from real life.  DJ Qualls (The Core) once again plays the nerdy friend to the tee.  Qualls will probably always look seventeen, but he's a disciplined performer, and shines in his role.  Natasha Lyonne and Michael Rapaport are such caricatures that when Lyonne decides to end their marriage, it seems way out of character.  Cary Elwes plays way against type as the hoodlum Carter, but even his metamorphosis from a guy trying to make life work to a crazed kidnapper seems improbable.Eileen Brennan is glorious as the intended victim, and though she looked very old and frail, her reserve energy boosted the film when she was on screen.A different kind of film, but not as fulfilling as it should have been.",3,FUNNY BOOKS,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,1456,"['Eileen', 'Brennan', 'way', 'long', 'ago', 'LAUGH', 'IN', 'PRIVATE', 'BENJAMIN', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'when', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'funny', 'books', 'movie', 'obsessive', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'collectors', 'sums', 'up', 'banality', 'obsession', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'VILLAINS', 'out', 'fairly', 'light', 'vein', 'funny', 'scenes', 'then', 'bleakly', 'dark', 'end', 'movie', 'feel', 'need', 'Prozac', 'lesser', 'known', 'film', 'STRANGER', 'THAN', 'FICTION', 'did', 'funny', 'horrifying', 'segue', 'worked', 'Somehow', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'VILLAINS', ""n't"", 'make', 'transition', 'easily', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'totally', 'obsessed', 'Raymond', 'out', 'rather', 'cool', 'then', 'almost', 'zany', 'obsession', 'end', 'murderous', 'rage', 'totally', 'real', 'life', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'Core', 'once', 'again', 'nerdy', 'friend', 'tee', 'Qualls', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'look', 'seventeen', 'disciplined', 'performer', 'shines', 'role', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'are', 'such', 'caricatures', 'when', 'Lyonne', 'end', 'marriage', 'way', 'character', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'way', 'type', 'hoodlum', 'Carter', 'even', 'metamorphosis', 'guy', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'work', 'crazed', 'kidnapper', 'improbable.Eileen', 'Brennan', 'glorious', 'intended', 'victim', 'looked', 'very', 'old', 'frail', 'reserve', 'energy', 'boosted', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'screen.A', 'different', 'kind', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'fulfilling', 'should', 'have', 'been']",Comic Book Villains
710299,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00006AUJG,Only-A-Child,"[4, 6]","James Robinson started out with a pretty good idea although I was hoping for a character based more on the comic book guy from ""The Simpsons"". He had enough money to make a technically solid feature out of his material, and he did a fairly good job of casting (except for Cary Elwes). I won't bother to summarize the plot but will just address what went wrong. And enough is wrong to render this thing genuinely terrible.It appears that Robinson was inspired to totally change his original ending late in the game, but was not inspired enough to rewrite the first half of his screenplay (very lazy). Which means there is a HUGE disconnection between the first and the second halves of the movie. This is not a good thing because in the first half Robinson provides film language elements (signs and syntax) that point in an entirely different direction from the way the film ends up going. The whole idea of film is to effectively tell a story; bottom line is that writers and directors who do this well are considered talented.As I was watching it I gave it more credit than it deserved. I was waiting for them to reveal that the mother and the robber had just set up the store-owners to teach them a lesson. After a point I had to abandon this idea and began to wonder if it was a parody without any humor. If that's the idea then someone should explain to Robinson that to be successful a parody should be funny.There were some very good shots in this movie. Natasha Lyonne gave a particularly good performance even if it was a grown-up version of her ""American Pie"" character.

710303,A5OLZCDKGED5Z,B00006AUJG,Vincent Zahedi,"[11, 15]","I am not a comic book fan. I have read a few comic books, but not enough to be called a reader, let alone a collector. I was drawn into the premise of this movie, and also believe that Michael Rappaport has the ability to turn dog[doo] into diamonds, no matter what the role. I am also a fan of Donal Logue, and I have an appreciation for culty films like this. As it turns out, the comic book aspect was not too extreme. ""Comic Book Villains"" requires a familiarity for the themes of comic books, rather than the comics themselves. There are three types of comic book 'geeks' in the movie: the hardcore collector, represented by Logue's character; the famous book reader, who knows everything about popular comics, but nothing about less-known ones; and the casual reader, represented by DJ Quall's character of Archie. His role is where the problems begin. Every moment that Logue, Rappaport, or Cary Elwes is on screen, the movie shines of brilliant observation and attention to dialogue (even though the funniest conversation is blatently ripped off from Kevin Smith's ""Mallrats""). However, Archie was written as the ideal reader, a guy who understands that comics are entertainment, not reality. He epitomizes everything i dislike about this movie. Every scene he is in is either hinting at a message, or explaining a message. The theme Archie brings to the story is furthered by ridiculously pathetic acts of violence and obsession, which ruin the film's last 4th. If one were to watch the ending of the movie and then the beginning, he would not have any idea they belonged to the same picture. Take Natasha Lyonne's character for instance. At the opening of the movie, she is a bright woman who runs a comic book store very casually. A slow change and character ark would have been brilliant for her character. However, after one stupid plot-hole-filled scene, she becomes a vengeful warrior obsessed with getting the mcguffin of the piece, the dead man's comics. And by the end, the film has made such lifeless criminals out of the characters, I couldn't even enjoy watching Logue, Rappaport, or Elwes anymore. The theme of the movie jumps so violently from comedy to black ""comedy"", that it no longer becomes entertaining. A potentially brilliant film cut down by the director's hatred for comic book readers.",3,"What could have, my, what could have been.",1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,2319,"['am', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'have', 'read', 'few', 'comic', 'books', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'called', 'reader', 'let', 'alone', 'collector', 'was', 'drawn', 'premise', 'movie', 'also', 'believe', 'Michael', 'Rappaport', 'ability', 'turn', 'dog', '[', 'doo', ']', 'diamonds', 'matter', 'what', 'role', 'am', 'also', 'fan', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'have', 'appreciation', 'culty', 'films', 'out', 'comic', 'book', 'aspect', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'extreme', 'Comic', 'Book', 'Villains', 'familiarity', 'themes', 'comic', 'books', 'rather', 'comics', 'are', 'three', 'types', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'hardcore', 'collector', 'represented', 'Logue', 'character', 'famous', 'book', 'reader', 'who', 'everything', 'popular', 'comics', 'nothing', 'less-known', 'ones', 'casual', 'reader', 'represented', 'DJ', 'Quall', 'character', 'Archie', 'role', 'where', 'problems', 'begin', 'moment', 'Logue', 'Rappaport', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'screen', 'movie', 'shines', 'brilliant', 'observation', 'attention', 'dialogue', 'even', 'funniest', 'conversation', 'blatently', 'ripped', 'off', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Mallrats', 'However', 'Archie', 'was', 'written', 'ideal', 'reader', 'guy', 'who', 'comics', 'are', 'entertainment', 'not', 'reality', 'everything', 'i', 'dislike', 'movie', 'scene', 'hinting', 'message', 'explaining', 'message', 'theme', 'Archie', 'story', 'furthered', 'ridiculously', 'pathetic', 'acts', 'violence', 'obsession', 'ruin', 'film', 'last', '4th', 'one', 'were', 'watch', 'ending', 'movie', 'then', 'beginning', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'idea', 'belonged', 'same', 'picture', 'Take', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', 'character', 'instance', 'opening', 'movie', 'bright', 'woman', 'who', 'comic', 'book', 'store', 'very', 'casually', 'slow', 'change', 'character', 'ark', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'character', 'However', 'one', 'stupid', 'plot-hole-filled', 'scene', 'vengeful', 'warrior', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'mcguffin', 'piece', 'dead', 'man', 'comics', 'end', 'film', 'made', 'such', 'lifeless', 'criminals', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Logue', 'Rappaport', 'Elwes', 'anymore', 'theme', 'movie', 'so', 'violently', 'comedy', 'black', 'comedy', 'no', 'longer', 'entertaining', 'potentially', 'brilliant', 'film', 'cut', 'down', 'director', 'hatred', 'comic', 'book', 'readers']",Comic Book Villains
710304,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,B00006AUJG,"Yendor ""sknayfan""","[2, 6]","There is an underlining message to COMIC BOOK VILLIANS.  All involved in this film must either hate comic books and its industry or know a lot about it... or care about comic books to put out this ""message"" film.  It can go either way. In the mid-to-late 90's, the comic book industry and its subculture went on a collecting and memorabilia craze. People thought they were going to buy comic books as investments and be millionaires. That plan bottomed out and the industry nose-dived. COMIC BOOK VILLIANS indirectly is an outgrowth of what happened to the industry in the late 90's. The film is a cross between PULP FICTION, A SIMPLE PLAN, and VERY BAD THINGS with a touch of 'Kevin Smith' thrown into the mix. Two rival comic book storeowners Ray and Norman (Donal Logue / Michael Rapaport respectively) in a small town find out a local avid collector has died. Then they figure that they can get his comic book collection and sell it for a windfall. Unfortunately, the guy lived at his Mom's house (Eileen Brennan) where he kept his collection and she refuses to sell.  So, the two rivals devise plans to woo her to get the collection.  However, she stands her ground not to sell. They end up resorting to drastic measures to get the collection and it gets real ugly, and very, very, violent. The plot starts out innocently enough with the script and dialogue having ""comic book-knowledge"" banter and even mentions the SDComic Con Int. (The San Diego Comic Con International)etc. However, it suddenly takes a sharp left turn and it is jarring and unwatchable.  None of the characters are likeable. The only positive aspect of the film is that one of the characters; a comic book aficionado  (D.J. Qualls as Archie) realizes the futility of comic book collecting and comes out on top.  Therefore, as stated, there is an underlining message of the film; and that it is telling comic book 'fan-boys' to ""GET-A-LIFE!"" and that there is a whole world out there to explore besides the world of comic books and its obsession with memorabilia and collections. The film is blatant in this message  and if that is its main intent, it is a scathing dig on the whole culture of the comic book industry.",2,Comic Book Fan Boys Run  Amouk,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,2193,"['underlining', 'message', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'VILLIANS', 'involved', 'film', 'must', 'either', 'hate', 'comic', 'books', 'industry', 'know', 'lot', 'care', 'comic', 'books', 'put', 'out', 'message', 'film', 'can', 'go', 'way', 'mid-to-late', '90', 'comic', 'book', 'industry', 'subculture', 'went', 'collecting', 'memorabilia', 'craze', 'People', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'buy', 'comic', 'books', 'investments', 'be', 'millionaires', 'plan', 'bottomed', 'out', 'industry', 'nose-dived', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'VILLIANS', 'indirectly', 'outgrowth', 'what', 'happened', 'industry', 'late', '90', 'film', 'cross', 'PULP', 'FICTION', 'A', 'SIMPLE', 'PLAN', 'VERY', 'BAD', 'THINGS', 'touch', ""'Kevin"", 'Smith', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Two', 'rival', 'comic', 'book', 'storeowners', 'Ray', 'Norman', 'Donal', 'Logue', '/', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'respectively', 'small', 'town', 'find', 'out', 'local', 'avid', 'collector', 'died', 'Then', 'figure', 'can', 'get', 'comic', 'book', 'collection', 'sell', 'windfall', 'Unfortunately', 'guy', 'lived', 'Mom', 'house', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'where', 'kept', 'collection', 'sell', 'So', 'two', 'rivals', 'devise', 'plans', 'woo', 'get', 'collection', 'However', 'ground', 'not', 'sell', 'end', 'up', 'resorting', 'drastic', 'measures', 'get', 'collection', 'real', 'ugly', 'very', 'very', 'violent', 'plot', 'out', 'innocently', 'enough', 'script', 'dialogue', 'having', 'comic', 'book-knowledge', 'banter', 'even', 'mentions', 'SDComic', 'Con', 'Int', 'San', 'Diego', 'Comic', 'Con', 'International', 'etc', 'However', 'suddenly', 'sharp', 'left', 'turn', 'jarring', 'unwatchable', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'only', 'positive', 'aspect', 'film', 'one', 'characters', 'comic', 'book', 'aficionado', 'D.J', 'Qualls', 'Archie', 'futility', 'comic', 'book', 'collecting', 'out', 'top', 'Therefore', 'stated', 'underlining', 'message', 'film', 'telling', 'comic', 'book', ""'fan-boys"", 'GET-A-LIFE', 'whole', 'world', 'there', 'explore', 'world', 'comic', 'books', 'obsession', 'memorabilia', 'collections', 'film', 'blatant', 'message', 'main', 'intent', 'scathing', 'dig', 'whole', 'culture', 'comic', 'book', 'industry']",Comic Book Villains
