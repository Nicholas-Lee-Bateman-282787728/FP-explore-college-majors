The three stories were all excellent, with great performances by Matt Dillon and Paul Walker (worth watching just for the way he moves his fingers).  On the surface, this movie would seem analogous to a dinner at a Chinese restaurant; that is, thoroughly enjoyed but quickly forgotten.  Yet, many deep questions keep coming to mind regarding one of the movie's core themes:  Salvation.  Specifically the characters of ""The Man"" and the Preacher.  ""The Man"" shows up in a pickup truck, looking like the Marlboro man dressed in black and offers salvation in the form of a shotgun.  The recipient of his largess quickly puts the shotgun to deadly use, killing his backstabbing buddies along with himself.  In contrast, we have the Preacher man, dressed in white, who hangs around a local restaurant called ""The Fire Pit"".  He has the ability to seemingly appear from nowhere and hands out pamphlets that appear to have Satan drawn on them.  Oh, and he goes around making deals for people's souls.  In contrast to ""The Man"", the result of the Preacher's dealings are pretty benign.  Thanks to the Preacher, Ricky Baldowski (the Elvis impersonator) can suddenly belt out a version of ""Amazing Grace"" that is good enough to make old enemies (like feuding barbers Doc and Cook) make up.  So, who is offering salvation and who is offering damnation?  Is the point that we can't tell the difference?

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 3]","PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES is not really a good film, yet despite its problems, it is intriguing, weird and quite entertaining.Some viewers have described the picture as ""a redneck version of PULP FICTION,"" but I think that's a stretch.  Essentially, the movie consists of three unconnected stories, told separately yet all supposedly taking place at the same time, that lightly intersect along the way.  What they do have in common is that, for the most part, they all begin at a rural Louisiana pawnshop run by Vincent D'Onofrio.In one story, a trio of goofy white-supremacist drug addicts decides to rob a meth lab, but the plan goes awry when one of them (Lukas Haas) pawns their only gun in order to buy enough gas to get there.A second, much darker tale begins when a newlywed (Matt Dillon) discovers a unique ring in the pawnshop that belonged to his first wife who disappeared six years earlier, sending him on a violence-filled search to find her.The final story concerns a down on his luck Elvis Presley impersonator (Brendan Fraser), who makes a life-changing decision when he comes to a small town to play the local fair.Written by Adam Minarovich and directed by Wayne Kramer, PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES contains a number of ethereal elements that are never satisfactorily resolved.  Indeed, expanded, each of the three stories has a strong enough premise that they would probably have worked as a separate film.  Having them ""touch shoulders"" in this movie seems like a forced effort.The cast, when you can decipher their Southern dialects, is first-rate.  They include Elijah Wood, Thomas Jane, Norman Reedus, Pell James, Chi McBride and Paul Walker.PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES is available via Anchor Bay Entertainment in both a Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack and as a separate DVD.

The second tale involves Richard (Matt Dillon) attempting to track down his long lost wife (Pell James). The third involves a down on his luck Elvis impersonator (Brendan Fraser).This could be described as a grindhouse, ""Creepshow"" style. The episodes are clever dark comedy, marvelously written, directed, and acted. For those like their films on the oddball Tarantino side, check this one out. Yes, it had me laughing out loud, especially the first episode.Warning: Film contains scenes of captive women who had been abused and treats it on the light side.Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, Masturbation (Elijah Wood) TV screen sex, nudity (Pell James, plus many more)",5,SALVATION COMES IN MANY FORMS,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,909,"['Alton', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'pawn', 'shop', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'connecting', 'link', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'also', 'loosely', 'linked', 'first', 'tale', 'misadventures', 'crack', 'heads', 'wanting', 'rob', 'manufacturer', 'second', 'tale', 'Richard', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'attempting', 'track', 'down', 'long', 'lost', 'wife', 'Pell', 'James', 'third', 'down', 'luck', 'Elvis', 'impersonator', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', '.This', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'grindhouse', 'Creepshow', 'style', 'episodes', 'are', 'clever', 'dark', 'comedy', 'marvelously', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'films', 'oddball', 'Tarantino', 'side', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'Yes', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'especially', 'first', 'episode.Warning', 'Film', 'scenes', 'captive', 'women', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'abused', 'light', 'side.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'N-word', 'Masturbation', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'TV', 'screen', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Pell', 'James', 'many', 'more']",N/A

There are three stories in all and they are all brought together during the course of the film.The first tale is of some meth addicted white supremacists. Their story centres on a pawned shotgun and features a brilliant performance from Paul Walker playing the marvellously named `Raw Dog. There is a brilliant scene where him and his bro discuss the politics of being a white supremacist and find they come up a bit wanting.Then tale two takes us on a dark ride with Matt Dillon who finds a ring, in the same shop, that had belonged to his missing wife. His search for her is ruthless and unveils a very unsettling surprise - with Elijah Wood playing a role as far removed from his Hobbiting days as one can imagine.The trio is completed with Brendan Fraser giving a bravura performance as one of the World's worst Elvis tribute acts. He must have had a blast playing it and that pays off in what turned out to be the biggest surprise of a film so far this year - absolutely recommended.",5,"A Tale of Pawned Goods, Salvation and Elvis",1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,1120,"['great', 'indie', 'effort', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'linked', 'objects', 'have', 'wound', 'up', 'down', 'market', 'pawn', 'shop', 'are', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'course', 'film.The', 'first', 'tale', 'meth', 'addicted', 'white', 'supremacists', 'story', 'centres', 'pawned', 'shotgun', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'playing', 'marvellously', 'named', 'Raw', 'Dog', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'where', 'bro', 'politics', 'being', 'white', 'supremacist', 'find', 'come', 'up', 'bit', 'wanting.Then', 'tale', 'two', 'dark', 'ride', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'ring', 'same', 'shop', 'had', 'belonged', 'missing', 'wife', 'search', 'ruthless', 'very', 'unsettling', 'surprise', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'playing', 'role', 'far', 'removed', 'Hobbiting', 'days', 'one', 'can', 'imagine.The', 'trio', 'completed', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'giving', 'bravura', 'performance', 'one', 'World', 'worst', 'Elvis', 'tribute', 'acts', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'blast', 'playing', 'off', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'absolutely', 'recommended']",N/A

One day a kid comes in with a ring to pawn. This innocent event triggers something that affects many people including a group of meth addicts, an Elvis impersonator, and the original owner of the ring. I really like this type of movie. Movies where one event connects a wide variety of people and the stories all end up converging. They are fun to watch and are usually well written. The best of this type is obviously Crash but there have been others. That said, this is watchable, funny and entertaining but nothing amazing. The best part of this movie is Brendan Frasier as Elvis, it took me a while to realize it was him, but he was really funny and great in this. There is some really dark humor in this but there is also main stream humor, there is a little bit of everything in this. I liked it but it's not something I think I would watch again. Overall, funny and entertaining. A fun one time watch. I give it a B.",3,"A darkly funny, entertaining and fun movie that I enjoyed. I love movies like this. One event affects strangers.

I was blown away.  It was crazy!!  It was funny, it was ridiculous, it was weird....it was entertaining!!!  Paul Walker was awesome...a real change for him.  Funny!!!  Matt Dillon was great as well.  I just really enjoyed this movie.  It's not a movie for everyone though...you have to have an open mind and just want to be entertained, not looking for an academy award caliber movie. In other words, if you are into deep, meaningful movies, this is not for you.
