441970,AD0HF7KPJ64AD,6304968868,Bane's Errant Nephew (starscream44@hotmail.com),"[9, 12]","After creating so many beautiful situations and so much heart-wrenching drama in the past 20-some episodes, Gainax dropped its trousers and urinated all over me in the last few volumes of Eva. I KNOW it's not the  true end to the story, which is dandy, but as a de facto conclusion to the  characters and events of the series, it's tremendously disappointing. I had  always thought that Eva had many things in common with the writings of  sci-fi mastermind Robert Heinlein, and 0:13 reinforces this as Shinji  finally leaves his troubled childhood and accepts his worth as a man. But  that's the only redeeming feature of the end of the Eva series as we  Americans get to see it. The alternate reality that Shinji summons in the  ending minutes borders on endearing (especially with Megumi Hayashbiyara's  Rei suddenly becoming a frantic, clumsy schoolgirl), but in the end is only  a detour.The ending episodes weigh heavily in Cartesian and Spinozistic  philosophy, but who the hell wants to see an animated series based on the  works of Spinoza? I would have rather had a few questions answered,  particularly as to the true motivations of Gendo Ikari (is he utilitarian  or just an obsessive genius who killed his wife?), the bastardized lineage  of the Angels, what the full potential of the Evas was, and the reality of  Rei. Oh, and the character that is probably squandered the most in the  endgame is Asuka, who had the determination to overcome the destruction  inflicted by the Angels and her own past, but instead is turned into  another manic-depressive basket case like Shinji. That's not fate. That's  bad storytelling. Shinji provides enough think-skulled mopery for Eva and  three other series like it. In the end, he beats his demons - but we have  to wonder about everyone else.Neon Genesis Evangelion was a brilliant  series, but it was brilliant not because of the copious theological and  scientific material, but because of the human element that made all the  characters close to us. For whatever reason, that human element is largely  lost toward the end - and Eva suffers big time. It's like having a  wonderful four course meal and then having it all ruined by a nasty piece  of Brie cheese at the end. Like that repulsive fromage, the end of the Eva  TV series is interesting, but it tastes awful and most definitely leaves  something to be desired. Sorry Eva fans, but this is a real letdown. I  expect the recut ending and movies to be as spectacular as everyone says  they heard they were. Let's bring them over here posthaste, so we can have  a real eclair-like ending, all right?",3,"Ah, a nice slice of Brie after a four-course dinner.",932515200,"07 21, 1999",1999,2612,"['creating', 'so', 'many', 'beautiful', 'situations', 'so', 'much', 'heart-wrenching', 'drama', 'past', '20-some', 'episodes', 'Gainax', 'dropped', 'trousers', 'urinated', 'last', 'few', 'volumes', 'Eva', 'KNOW', 'not', 'true', 'end', 'story', 'dandy', 'de', 'facto', 'conclusion', 'characters', 'events', 'series', 'tremendously', 'disappointing', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'Eva', 'had', 'many', 'things', 'common', 'writings', 'sci-fi', 'mastermind', 'Robert', 'Heinlein', '0:13', 'reinforces', 'Shinji', 'finally', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'accepts', 'worth', 'man', 'only', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'end', 'Eva', 'series', 'Americans', 'get', 'see', 'alternate', 'reality', 'Shinji', 'summons', 'ending', 'minutes', 'borders', 'endearing', 'especially', 'Megumi', 'Hayashbiyara', 'Rei', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'frantic', 'clumsy', 'schoolgirl', 'end', 'only', 'detour.The', 'ending', 'episodes', 'weigh', 'heavily', 'Cartesian', 'Spinozistic', 'philosophy', 'who', 'hell', 'see', 'animated', 'series', 'based', 'works', 'Spinoza', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'had', 'few', 'questions', 'answered', 'particularly', 'true', 'motivations', 'Gendo', 'Ikari', 'utilitarian', 'just', 'obsessive', 'genius', 'who', 'killed', 'wife', 'bastardized', 'lineage', 'Angels', 'what', 'full', 'potential', 'Evas', 'was', 'reality', 'Rei', 'Oh', 'character', 'probably', 'squandered', 'most', 'endgame', 'Asuka', 'who', 'had', 'determination', 'overcome', 'destruction', 'inflicted', 'Angels', 'own', 'past', 'instead', 'turned', 'manic-depressive', 'basket', 'case', 'Shinji', 'not', 'fate', 'bad', 'storytelling', 'Shinji', 'enough', 'think-skulled', 'mopery', 'Eva', 'three', 'other', 'series', 'end', 'demons', 'have', 'wonder', 'everyone', 'else.Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'was', 'brilliant', 'series', 'was', 'brilliant', 'not', 'copious', 'theological', 'scientific', 'material', 'human', 'element', 'made', 'characters', 'close', 'reason', 'human', 'element', 'largely', 'lost', 'end', 'Eva', 'suffers', 'big', 'time', 'having', 'wonderful', 'four', 'course', 'meal', 'then', 'having', 'ruined', 'nasty', 'piece', 'Brie', 'cheese', 'end', 'repulsive', 'fromage', 'end', 'Eva', 'TV', 'series', 'interesting', 'awful', 'most', 'definitely', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'Sorry', 'Eva', 'fans', 'real', 'letdown', 'expect', 'recut', 'ending', 'movies', 'be', 'as', 'spectacular', 'everyone', 'heard', 'were', 'Let', 'bring', 'over', 'here', 'posthaste', 'can', 'have', 'real', 'eclair-like', 'ending', 'right']",N/A

Gainax and Hideaki Anno have never released any statement (to my knowledge) to that effect. Instead they are compliments to eachother, with the episodes taking place at a crucial point in the movie.Bear in mind that you need several viewings of this video to truly be able to think about it, for it disturbs, depresses, enlightens and uplifts (and in that order too, if memory serves me well).Please toss out all stereotypes, previous concepts of the world, thoughts about you lifes problems and pretty much everything you can think of.

441972,AT576Z9DC6HJ0,6304968868,D. K. Malone,"[2, 3]","As the finale to what I consider to be the greatest anime series thus far, perhaps 0:13 was doomed to disappoint... or so I thought until I finally obtained a fan-sub of the End of Evangelion movie. I wholeheartedly prefer the movie version of the ending to these two episodes. While I am glad I was able to glean some valuable insight from the psychological outpouring of this tape, I watch anime first and foremost to be entertained. I did not find this tape to be entertaining per se. I watched it with a sense of solemn duty. It's painfully didactic. It's not impossible to be both enlightening -and- entertaining. I am suspect of any who would claim that they found these episodes to be literally ""entertaining"". (Well, except for one short hilarious sequence which I won't spoil.) EoE maybe be every bit as confusing, perhaps more so, but I personally found it to be infinitely more enjoyable to watch... although it ranks much higher than the series ending in my ""Most Depressing Top 10"" list. :)Be it known that the writer/director of the EVA series, Anno Hidekai, is an extremely troubled man.EDITED July 16, 2001:According to ""The Red Cross Book"" (which was sold at End Of Evangelion screenings during its original theatrical release in Japan in 1997 and was officially endorsed by GAINAX,) the original scripts for the final two episodes of the series were scrapped. The reasons are not made clear, but there are rumors that sponsor funding was cut due to controversy about the content, and that Hideaki and GAINAX were pressured to end the series differently, in a very short time frame. The result is the two episodes on the this tape. The book then goes on to say that the original scrapped scripts were essentially fished out of the trash and became the basis for the feature film End of Evangelion. In other words, it's arguable that the final two episodes of the TV series are invalid, and that EoE is in fact the true ending to the story.",2,Sudden Left Turn,946771200,"01 2, 2000",2000,1956,"['finale', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'greatest', 'anime', 'series', 'thus', 'far', 'perhaps', '0:13', 'was', 'doomed', 'disappoint', 'so', 'thought', 'finally', 'obtained', 'fan-sub', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'movie', 'wholeheartedly', 'prefer', 'movie', 'version', 'ending', 'two', 'episodes', 'am', 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'glean', 'valuable', 'insight', 'psychological', 'outpouring', 'tape', 'watch', 'anime', 'first', 'foremost', 'be', 'entertained', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'tape', 'be', 'entertaining', 'se', 'watched', 'sense', 'solemn', 'duty', 'painfully', 'didactic', 'not', 'impossible', 'be', 'enlightening', '-and-', 'entertaining', 'am', 'suspect', 'who', 'would', 'claim', 'found', 'episodes', 'be', 'literally', 'entertaining', 'Well', 'one', 'short', 'hilarious', 'sequence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'EoE', 'maybe', 'be', 'bit', 'confusing', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'personally', 'found', 'be', 'infinitely', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'much', 'higher', 'series', 'ending', 'Most', 'Depressing', 'Top', '10', 'list', 'Be', 'known', 'writer/director', 'EVA', 'series', 'Anno', 'Hidekai', 'extremely', 'troubled', 'man.EDITED', 'July', '16', '2001', 'According', 'Red', 'Cross', 'Book', 'was', 'sold', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'screenings', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Japan', '1997', 'was', 'officially', 'endorsed', 'GAINAX', 'original', 'scripts', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'series', 'were', 'scrapped', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'are', 'rumors', 'sponsor', 'funding', 'was', 'cut', 'due', 'controversy', 'content', 'Hideaki', 'GAINAX', 'were', 'pressured', 'end', 'series', 'differently', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'result', 'two', 'episodes', 'tape', 'book', 'then', 'say', 'original', 'scrapped', 'scripts', 'were', 'essentially', 'fished', 'trash', 'became', 'basis', 'feature', 'film', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'other', 'words', 'arguable', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'invalid', 'EoE', 'fact', 'true', 'ending', 'story']",N/A

It truly is worth owning this whole series.Evangelion 0:13 is a departure from most of the above.  the director primarily tries to move the viewer into the dark parts of the Evangelion characters' mind by using surreal settings, storyboard sketches, and photographicc images as metaphores to represent the dialog. Unfortunately it falls short.  What may work well for poetry fails when applied to anime.Evangelion 0:13 lacks in episodic delivery as well.  It is more stream of consciousness then story. You do see how these characters think and feel, but I would have rather discovered these traits through unusual situations and the craft of animation itself rather than dialog.

Studio Gainax was making radical new anime that  was freaking out the traditional audiences. And then good old Anno was  almost as screwed up as Shinji was. For four years before EVA came out,  Anno was a broken man, incapable of doing anything, because he realized  that if he stopped making anime, he'd have nothing left. Shinji says that  he feels like when he pilots EVA, others like him and his existence is  meaningful: this is a way for anno to talk about how he feels about himself  making anime.

441982,A36D94ZAIRFAA1,6304968868,Trevor Wright,"[0, 0]","What an amazing series Evangelion is, sad to say it ends without answering a lot of the questions I still had. A lot of reviewers got nightmares from  watching this clash of images and death and chaos... so did I. I had to  watch these 2 episodes about 5 or 6 times before I got what was going on.  Let me see if I can summarize:About 12 Angels (though techincally only  one) come down to attack the Earth again, meanwhile NERV is under attack by  the Seele group which Shinji's father is actually in league with so they  can do the Third Impact. Since humans haven't killed humans in a long time  apparently, NERV forces falls easily except the command center. Misato gets  Asuka into her EVA (even though she is unconscious) and sends her out into  a lake to protect her... Misato then goes to rescuse Shinji, who is moping  around wanting to die.Meanwhile, Ikari is at the bottom of NERV with Rei  preparing to merge her with the 1st Angel that they have kept hidden, Adam.  Misato finds Shinji and starts to take him to his EVA. She manages to get  him there but is killed in the process. Asuka wakes up in her EVA and  proceeds to attack the Seele forces and the 12 Angels around there. Asuka  power supply gets cut off but she manages to kill each of the 12 Angels  except for one and when she is going to deliver the final blow, a spear  shoots right through her EVA. The 12 Angels, who we thought were dead, wake  up and proceed to destroy EVA-02.Meanwhile, Shinji is still wanting to  die, but his EVA-01 now has a soul of it's own and picks up Shinji and puts  him in the cockpit and leaves NERV. The 12 Angels and EVA-01 then proceed  to create an Anti-AT Field. Rei merges with Adam and decides to help Shinji  instead of Shiniji's father. After a lot of weird stuff everyone on the  Earth is killed and transformed into one soul, Rei also merges with EVA-01  and completes the Third Impact.Shinji then learns some things about Rei,  Asuka, and Misato that he didn't know and that he is not the center of the  world, but Rei allows him to decided how to reshape the new world. All  Shinji wants is to be happy but doesn't know what it is. He discovers that  happyness for him is actually being with Asuka, even though she loaths him  and she always makes him miserable, but for his happyness he wants to be  with her for the rest of his life.Then the movie ends. A lot of this  doesn't make much sense, but I think that the director left it open to your  own interpretation. Of course you want to see the end of this great series,  but this ending leaves you feeling empty and confused, I know I was.",4,Took me a while to figure this stuff out...,965347200,"08 4, 2000",2000,2612,"['What', 'amazing', 'series', 'Evangelion', 'sad', 'say', 'answering', 'lot', 'questions', 'still', 'had', 'A', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'got', 'nightmares', 'watching', 'clash', 'images', 'death', 'chaos', 'so', 'did', 'I.', 'had', 'watch', '2', 'episodes', '5', '6', 'times', 'got', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Let', 'see', 'can', 'summarize', '12', 'Angels', 'techincally', 'only', 'one', 'come', 'down', 'attack', 'Earth', 'again', 'meanwhile', 'NERV', 'attack', 'Seele', 'group', 'Shinji', 'father', 'actually', 'league', 'can', 'do', 'Third', 'Impact', 'humans', 'have', ""n't"", 'killed', 'humans', 'long', 'time', 'apparently', 'NERV', 'forces', 'easily', 'command', 'center', 'Misato', 'Asuka', 'EVA', 'even', 'unconscious', 'out', 'lake', 'protect', 'Misato', 'then', 'rescuse', 'Shinji', 'who', 'moping', 'around', 'wanting', 'die.Meanwhile', 'Ikari', 'bottom', 'NERV', 'Rei', 'preparing', 'merge', '1st', 'Angel', 'have', 'kept', 'hidden', 'Adam', 'Misato', 'Shinji', 'take', 'EVA', 'get', 'there', 'killed', 'process', 'Asuka', 'up', 'EVA', 'proceeds', 'attack', 'Seele', 'forces', '12', 'Angels', 'there', 'Asuka', 'power', 'supply', 'cut', 'off', 'kill', '12', 'Angels', 'one', 'when', 'going', 'deliver', 'final', 'blow', 'spear', 'shoots', 'right', 'EVA', '12', 'Angels', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'dead', 'wake', 'up', 'proceed', 'destroy', 'EVA-02.Meanwhile', 'Shinji', 'still', 'wanting', 'die', 'EVA-01', 'now', 'soul', 'own', 'up', 'Shinji', 'cockpit', 'NERV', '12', 'Angels', 'EVA-01', 'then', 'proceed', 'create', 'Anti-AT', 'Field', 'Rei', 'Adam', 'help', 'Shinji', 'instead', 'Shiniji', 'father', 'lot', 'weird', 'stuff', 'everyone', 'Earth', 'killed', 'transformed', 'one', 'soul', 'Rei', 'also', 'EVA-01', 'Third', 'Impact.Shinji', 'then', 'things', 'Rei', 'Asuka', 'Misato', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'center', 'world', 'Rei', 'decided', 'how', 'reshape', 'new', 'world', 'Shinji', 'be', 'happy', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happyness', 'actually', 'being', 'Asuka', 'even', 'loaths', 'always', 'miserable', 'happyness', 'be', 'rest', 'life.Then', 'movie', 'lot', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'think', 'director', 'left', 'open', 'own', 'interpretation', 'course', 'want', 'see', 'end', 'great', 'series', 'ending', 'feeling', 'empty', 'confused', 'know', 'was']",N/A
