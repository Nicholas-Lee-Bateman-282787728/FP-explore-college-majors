However, because I really enjoyed Hidden Colors #1 and was excited to learn more from the historians and professors on Hidden Colors #2 - I decided to purchase.  I am so glad that I did!  The amount of knowledge given in this documentary is amazing.  During the video, professionals in history, education and the arts share research that dispels stereotypes about black people and Africa.  The information is enhanced by photographs of ancient paintings, statues, documents and videos.  I consider myself knowledgeable and this documentary had so much info that I did not know that I found myself running to google to learn more!  This is something that every black and brown person should watch repeatedly. I am purchasing copies for family and friends.",5,Entertaining and Full of Hard to Find Information!,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,910,"['was', 'little', 'nervous', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'Tariq', 'Nasheed', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'very', 'negative', 'blackwoman-bashing', 'videos', 'youtube', 'However', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Hidden', 'Colors', '1', 'was', 'excited', 'learn', 'more', 'historians', 'professors', 'Hidden', 'Colors', '2', 'decided', 'purchase', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'amount', 'knowledge', 'given', 'documentary', 'amazing', 'video', 'professionals', 'history', 'education', 'arts', 'share', 'research', 'black', 'people', 'Africa', 'information', 'enhanced', 'photographs', 'ancient', 'paintings', 'statues', 'documents', 'videos', 'consider', 'knowledgeable', 'documentary', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'info', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'found', 'running', 'google', 'learn', 'more', 'something', 'black', 'brown', 'person', 'should', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'am', 'purchasing', 'copies', 'family', 'friends']",Hidden Colors 2: The Triumph Of Melanin

Most of the information in the film, I already knew because I have been studying and traveling for 64 years.  I never had the money or opportunity to reach as many people as I hope ""Hidden Colors 2"" will.I would like however to say that Trucannini was not the last Aboriginal Tasmanian.  This is another trick used to exterminate from the human record, the existence of indigenous people. Indians have this problem too.  I would suggest that Tariq Nasheed see the two disc set ""The First Australians"" written and produced by Aborigines. I learned a lot about Aborigines during my 13 years in Australia and when working with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra.I'd also like to add that as concerns Hawai'ians you will find that many will tell you that they are definitely African--the Japanese came later.  How do I know?  On a visit to Hawai'i, I booked into a hotel.  I was married to an African from Kenya (lived there 10 years) and my last name was ""Kaloki."" When the receptionist saw me and looked at my name she asked whether I was Hawai'ian and I said ""No.""  She told me I had a Hawai'ian name.  I insisted it was African (this was in 1973) She said, ""We have people over here whom we call Kanakas and they look like you.""  We also have a god named Kaloki.  You might want to look into that sometime. I've had many of these experiences.  I also have compiled a 134 list of countries (1996) in which blacks are indigenous and I match mine against Tariq's with each ""Hidden Colors"" DVD that comes out. I'll close by saying thanks for doing what I could not do on as expansive basis as you have.  I have however started teaching private students, since I fit into the 60-70 year old teachers who still remember how it's done.Bonita Evans, Ph.D.",5,They've done it again- Hidden Colors 2,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,1851,"['What', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'so', 'good', 'know', 'someone', 'else', 'taking', 'up', 'challenge', 'Most', 'information', 'film', 'already', 'knew', 'have', 'been', 'studying', 'traveling', '64', 'years', 'never', 'had', 'money', 'opportunity', 'reach', 'many', 'people', 'hope', 'Hidden', 'Colors', '2', 'will.I', 'would', 'like', 'however', 'say', 'Trucannini', 'was', 'not', 'last', 'Aboriginal', 'Tasmanian', 'trick', 'used', 'exterminate', 'human', 'record', 'existence', 'indigenous', 'people', 'Indians', 'have', 'problem', 'too', 'would', 'suggest', 'Tariq', 'Nasheed', 'see', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'First', 'Australians', 'written', 'produced', 'Aborigines', 'learned', 'lot', 'Aborigines', '13', 'years', 'Australia', 'when', 'working', 'Department', 'Aboriginal', 'Affairs', 'Canberra.I', ""'d"", 'also', 'add', 'concerns', ""Hawai'ians"", 'will', 'find', 'many', 'will', 'tell', 'are', 'definitely', 'African', 'Japanese', 'came', 'later', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'visit', 'Hawai', 'i', 'booked', 'hotel', 'was', 'married', 'African', 'Kenya', 'lived', 'there', '10', 'years', 'last', 'name', 'was', 'Kaloki', 'When', 'receptionist', 'saw', 'looked', 'name', 'asked', 'was', ""Hawai'ian"", 'said', 'told', 'had', ""Hawai'ian"", 'name', 'insisted', 'was', 'African', 'was', '1973', 'said', 'have', 'people', 'here', 'whom', 'call', 'Kanakas', 'look', 'also', 'have', 'god', 'named', 'Kaloki', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'sometime', ""'ve"", 'had', 'many', 'experiences', 'also', 'have', 'compiled', '134', 'list', 'countries', '1996', 'blacks', 'are', 'indigenous', 'match', 'mine', 'Tariq', 'Hidden', 'Colors', 'DVD', 'out', ""'ll"", 'close', 'saying', 'thanks', 'doing', 'what', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'expansive', 'basis', 'have', 'have', 'however', 'started', 'teaching', 'private', 'students', 'fit', '60-70', 'year', 'old', 'teachers', 'who', 'still', 'remember', 'how', 'done.Bonita', 'Evans', 'Ph.D']",Hidden Colors 2: The Triumph Of Melanin

For example, the claim that the Egyptians were Africans is too broad. My understanding is that the first Pharaohs were Arabs but later dynasties were African.The claim that the term Moor is used to indicate that a person is African is dubious. I have been to Spain and stayed at the Alhambra in Granada and admired the Grand Mosque in Cordoba. These and other buildings were the work of Moors, who are the people of Morocco, which is a country on the Mediterranean Sea south of Spain. My dictionary says that the Moors were a mix of Arabs and Africans and were Muslims. They were better educated and more tolerant than the Visigoths who previously ruled all of Spain. When Los Reyes Catolicos came into power they held an Inquisition which required that all Muslims and Jews had to convert to Catholicism or be burned at the stake.It is true that Europeans lived in barns and Paris was a swamp when Muslims were translating the works of Plato and Aristotle into Arabic.Finally, what is your source for the magic of melanin? My dictionary says it is a dark pigment in the body of man and certain animals. My cat is a tortoise-shell cat(aka calico). Does she have melanin?
