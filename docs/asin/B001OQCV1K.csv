However, I was a little concerned with Cameron Diaz cast as the role of the mother, Sara Fitzgerald. As a matter of fact, after seeing the movie, I would still say she was my least favorite part of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Cameron Diaz's work, but in comedies usually. Abigail Breslin does a superb job as little sister Anna Fitzgerald. Sofia Vassilieva plays Anna's big sister Kate, who has had a lifelong battle with Leukemia. Sofia did, in my opinion, an amazing job. Throughout the whole movie, I was thinking to myself, I can handle this. But in the end, I could not.

1223207,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001OQCV1K,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Get out your box of tissue is right; this movie is designed to make you drain your eye sockets.  It's almost hart for me to critique this movie, because it has so much going for and against it that it's hard to pinpoint whether this was a great movie or a terrible one.  In the end, I have to settle with `very well intentioned', and that feels about right.The film tells the story of the Fitzgerald family.  Sara and Brian had two beautiful children, Jesse and Kate, before they realized that their eldest child was dying of leukemia.  In an attempt to secure her future (or at least a chunk of it), the Fitzgerald's decided to have another child, Anna, who was genetically engineered to be Kate's equal, serving as a donor baby since she was born.  This involved countless surgeries and hospital stays, endangering her life to sustain the life of her sister.  Right before Kate is set to have a very vital kidney transplant, Anna decides that she doesn't want to do it anymore.  She seeks out the help of a lawyer and proceeds to sue her parents for medical emancipation.  This throws a gigantic wrench in their family dynamic.  Her mother, Sara, is beyond furious.Anna has basically just murdered her sister.The essential plot here is fantastic.  This is such a morally complex tale that it leaves the audience on pins and needles throughout the entirety of the film.That said, there are some issues that I have here that are very standout to me.First, everything about this film seems almost too manufactured.  Each scene or character seems to set up with another scene or character in order to garner a bigger response from the audience.  It becomes frustrating because the film starts to lose its realistic and raw appeal.  It feels forced and thus begins to feel fake.  You sit back and think to yourself `oh, this is the point where they want me to cry' instead of just naturally letting go.  I also have an issue with some of the acting, namely Alec Baldwin (who should only do comedy from here on out), Joan Cusack (who almost gets it but suffers due to an overly manipulated character) and Abigail Breslin (who seems to be given far too many projects based on the sole fact that she got nominated for an Oscar for screaming and jumping up and down).  Breslin especially is a sore spot for me because she really carries the film and she comes across so forced and unsympathetic.  Her outbursts and especially her tears feel put-on.  I'm interested in reading the book because I felt that the character of Jesse really needed to be fleshed out more.  During part of the narration (which is also a tad overdone) Anna mentions that Jesse got his act together.  The film really doesn't make it clear what was wrong with him.  He just seemed depressed.And still, there is a lot to love here.  Cameron Diaz and the luminous Sofia Vassilieva are marvelous here.  The connection that one feels to the film is also a major plus.  This is a story that is bound to wreck havoc in the hearts of many, and rightfully so.  There are no bounds to what a parent will do for a child, but there are times when we try so hard we fail to open our ears to what is really important to that child.  A parent always feels as though they know best, but do they really?  I felt that the bond between Sofia and Cameron was beautiful and represented the true heart of this story.  Nothing about that relationship felt forced.  While certain aspects of the storyline seemed overdone and manipulated (okay, most every sub-plot was yet another setup to heartbreak), some of them really worked, especially the one concerning Kate's boyfriend.I don't think that `My Sister's Keeper' manages to be the morality play it tries to be, but it really tries and so I give it credit for that.  If Nick Cassavetes has practiced a little more restraint in his storytelling decisions (less is more) then this film would have felt a little more intimate and profound.  Some of his visual techniques were well used (the way that scenes became flushed with light, providing a dream like feeling) while others (the choppy flashbacks that took you out of the `now' for far too long) didn't quite do the trick.Still, there is a very poignant story hidden within this film, and there are enough reasons to see this film at least once.",3,Its good intentions get in its own way...,1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,4293,"['Get', 'out', 'box', 'tissue', 'right', 'movie', 'designed', 'make', 'drain', 'eye', 'sockets', 'almost', 'hart', 'critique', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'terrible', 'one', 'end', 'have', 'settle', 'very', 'well', 'intentioned', 'feels', 'right.The', 'film', 'story', 'Fitzgerald', 'family', 'Sara', 'Brian', 'had', 'two', 'beautiful', 'children', 'Jesse', 'Kate', 'realized', 'eldest', 'child', 'was', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'attempt', 'secure', 'future', 'least', 'chunk', 'Fitzgerald', 'decided', 'have', 'child', 'Anna', 'who', 'was', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'be', 'Kate', 'equal', 'serving', 'donor', 'baby', 'was', 'born', 'involved', 'countless', 'surgeries', 'hospital', 'stays', 'endangering', 'life', 'sustain', 'life', 'sister', 'Right', 'Kate', 'set', 'have', 'very', 'vital', 'kidney', 'transplant', 'Anna', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'anymore', 'out', 'help', 'lawyer', 'proceeds', 'sue', 'parents', 'medical', 'emancipation', 'gigantic', 'wrench', 'family', 'dynamic', 'mother', 'Sara', 'furious.Anna', 'basically', 'just', 'murdered', 'sister.The', 'essential', 'plot', 'here', 'fantastic', 'such', 'morally', 'complex', 'tale', 'audience', 'pins', 'needles', 'entirety', 'film.That', 'said', 'are', 'issues', 'have', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'standout', 'me.First', 'everything', 'film', 'almost', 'too', 'manufactured', 'scene', 'character', 'set', 'up', 'scene', 'character', 'order', 'garner', 'bigger', 'response', 'audience', 'frustrating', 'film', 'lose', 'realistic', 'raw', 'appeal', 'forced', 'thus', 'feel', 'fake', 'sit', 'back', 'think', 'oh', 'point', 'where', 'want', 'cry', 'instead', 'just', 'naturally', 'letting', 'go', 'also', 'have', 'issue', 'acting', 'namely', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'should', 'only', 'do', 'comedy', 'here', 'out', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'almost', 'suffers', 'due', 'overly', 'manipulated', 'character', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'who', 'be', 'given', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'projects', 'based', 'sole', 'fact', 'got', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'screaming', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'Breslin', 'especially', 'sore', 'spot', 'really', 'film', 'so', 'forced', 'unsympathetic', 'outbursts', 'especially', 'tears', 'feel', 'put-on', ""'m"", 'interested', 'reading', 'book', 'felt', 'character', 'Jesse', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'part', 'narration', 'also', 'tad', 'overdone', 'Anna', 'mentions', 'Jesse', 'got', 'act', 'together', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'just', 'seemed', 'depressed.And', 'still', 'lot', 'love', 'here', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'luminous', 'Sofia', 'Vassilieva', 'are', 'marvelous', 'here', 'connection', 'one', 'feels', 'film', 'also', 'major', 'plus', 'story', 'bound', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'hearts', 'many', 'rightfully', 'so', 'are', 'bounds', 'what', 'parent', 'will', 'do', 'child', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'fail', 'open', 'ears', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'child', 'parent', 'always', 'know', 'best', 'do', 'really', 'felt', 'bond', 'Sofia', 'Cameron', 'was', 'beautiful', 'represented', 'true', 'heart', 'story', 'Nothing', 'relationship', 'felt', 'forced', 'certain', 'aspects', 'storyline', 'seemed', 'overdone', 'manipulated', 'okay', 'most', 'sub-plot', 'was', 'yet', 'setup', 'heartbreak', 'really', 'worked', 'especially', 'one', 'concerning', 'Kate', 'boyfriend.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Sister', 'Keeper', 'manages', 'be', 'morality', 'play', 'be', 'really', 'so', 'give', 'credit', 'Nick', 'Cassavetes', 'practiced', 'little', 'more', 'restraint', 'storytelling', 'decisions', 'less', 'more', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'little', 'more', 'intimate', 'profound', 'visual', 'techniques', 'were', 'well', 'used', 'way', 'scenes', 'became', 'flushed', 'light', 'providing', 'dream', 'feeling', 'others', 'choppy', 'took', 'now', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'trick.Still', 'very', 'poignant', 'story', 'hidden', 'film', 'are', 'enough', 'reasons', 'see', 'film', 'least', 'once']",My Sister's Keeper

It's one of those storylines that's honestly impossible to NOT be moved by it to some extent, even if you don't wanna come out and admit it.It's about a girl who's dying of cancer, and she has a sister who doesn't wanna go through with the donar transplant.

Even timeless?You will constantly be guessing why the one girl doesn't wanna help her dying sister, and eventually you'll find out why.

It's one of those ""What would you do?"" situations, and unfortunately this particular family had to go through with it.The film also does a solid job focusing on the dying sister and shows us all the people she meets in the hospital.

""My Sister's Keeper"" is a beautiful, heartfelt story that's ambitious enough to be about more than a teenager sick with cancer; it presents us with a series of moral issues that have no easy solutions. We do expect to laugh and cry (mostly the latter), but we don't expect to think--at least, not as deeply as this. Of all the issues presented in this film, the main one is an eleven-year-old girl who was engineered rather than conceived. She's a perfect genetic match to her older sister, who suffers from a rare form of leukemia and often needs spare quantities of blood, marrow, and organs to keep her alive. The younger sister believes she has rights to her own body and subsequently sues her parents. In legal terms, she files a suit to be medically emancipated.Her name is Anna Fitzgerald (Abigail Breslin), who by all accounts would be a normal girl were it not for the fact that her sister, Kate (Sophia Vassilieva), is slipping further and further away. Their mother, Sara (Cameron Diaz), handles the situation as best she can, having given up her career as a lawyer to spend all her time at home. Naturally, she only thinks about keeping her daughter alive, which is why she has no qualms about using her other daughter's body for spare parts. She feels, quite understandably, that subjecting Anna to medical procedures isn't as hard as the thought of burying Kate. But in all those years, did she ever ask Anna how she feels about her role? Does the fact that she's a minor mean she doesn't have a say in this? Hoping to convince her parents that she does, she appeals to Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin), a defense attorney with a 91% success rate. He takes her case for reasons that aren't immediately obvious.How does the rest of the family deal with this? How does anyone deal with the realities of a terminal illness in the family? Sara's husband, a firefighter named Brian (Jason Patric), is beginning to question the idea of conceiving a child for medical purposes. ""We went against nature,"" he solemnly muses during one of the film's many moments of interior dialogue (the entire family given the chance to speak at least once). But there's more to it than that; it's gotten to the point where he no longer wants to drag Anna kicking and screaming to a hospital and hold her down while the nurses sedate her. After all, there's only so much of that a father can take.The middle child, their son Jesse (Evan Ellingson), is all but ignored, and while he never rebels, his solitary existence at dark bus stops make it obvious he's seriously considering it. And why not? It would be a sure fire attention getter. Goodness knows it took his parents long enough to realize that there was an explanation for his academic problems.And what about Kate? It seems that whenever we focus on someone's illness, we tend to forget that there's still a person underneath it all. Sara is so driven to save Kate's life that she never pauses to consider how Kate really feels about herself or her condition. This is understandable; as a mother, Sara doesn't want to go through the pain of burying a child. But at what point is it clear that there's nothing left to hold onto? Is there ever a time when it's better to let someone go, knowing it was only a matter of delaying the inevitable? ""I don't mind the cancer killing me,"" Kate says, ""but it's killing my family."" Then again, there is the part of her that wanted nothing more than to live the life of a normal teenager. She should be able to go shopping, hang out with friends, and date. Flashback sequences show her falling in love with another cancer patient, Taylor Ambrose (Thomas Dekker), who does whatever he can to make Kate feel better.I'm usually wary of movies like this, and that's because they're inherently manipulative. What makes ""My Sister's Keeper"" far better than the average tearjerker is that it doesn't exactly manipulate; rather, it suggests, and it does so at a subtler, more believable level. I suppose it's natural to question certain scenes after the fact, but when you're right in the middle of it, you let it happen. It's hard not to given the maturity of the story, the intensity of the performances, and the believability of the dialogue. By the end of the film, I guarantee you there will not be a dry eye in the house.Fortunately, this is a film that earns its heavy-handedness. We're not being forced to watch a shameless melodrama--we're being asked to engage in an ethical dilemma and determine for ourselves what was done right and what wasn't. Is it right to conceive a child for donor purposes? Is it right for a healthy individual to deny a sick individual access to necessary organs? Is there a point at which modern medicine can go too far? What I think and feel really doesn't matter. It only matters what you think and feel. ""My Sister's Keeper"" is powerful, intelligent, and incredibly moving, as I should have known it would be.",4,I Was Born to Be a Donor,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,5028,"['came', 'expecting', 'sappy', 'melodrama', 'came', 'out', 'clutching', 'tear-stained', 'movie', 'theater', 'napkin', 'Sister', 'Keeper', 'beautiful', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'ambitious', 'enough', 'be', 'more', 'teenager', 'sick', 'cancer', 'series', 'moral', 'issues', 'have', 'easy', 'solutions', 'do', 'expect', 'laugh', 'cry', 'mostly', 'latter', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'think', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'deeply', 'issues', 'presented', 'film', 'main', 'one', 'eleven-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'engineered', 'rather', 'conceived', 'perfect', 'genetic', 'match', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'rare', 'form', 'leukemia', 'often', 'spare', 'quantities', 'blood', 'marrow', 'organs', 'keep', 'alive', 'younger', 'sister', 'rights', 'own', 'body', 'subsequently', 'parents', 'legal', 'terms', 'suit', 'be', 'medically', 'emancipated.Her', 'name', 'Anna', 'Fitzgerald', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'who', 'accounts', 'would', 'be', 'normal', 'girl', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'sister', 'Kate', 'Sophia', 'Vassilieva', 'slipping', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'mother', 'Sara', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'situation', 'can', 'having', 'given', 'up', 'career', 'lawyer', 'spend', 'time', 'home', 'Naturally', 'only', 'keeping', 'daughter', 'alive', 'why', 'qualms', 'using', 'other', 'daughter', 'body', 'spare', 'parts', 'quite', 'understandably', 'subjecting', 'Anna', 'medical', 'procedures', ""n't"", 'as', 'hard', 'thought', 'burying', 'Kate', 'years', 'did', 'ever', 'ask', 'Anna', 'how', 'role', 'fact', 'minor', 'mean', ""n't"", 'have', 'say', 'Hoping', 'convince', 'parents', 'appeals', 'Campbell', 'Alexander', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'defense', 'attorney', '91', '%', 'success', 'rate', 'case', 'reasons', 'are', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'obvious.How', 'rest', 'family', 'deal', 'How', 'anyone', 'deal', 'realities', 'terminal', 'illness', 'family', 'Sara', 'husband', 'firefighter', 'named', 'Brian', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'beginning', 'question', 'idea', 'conceiving', 'child', 'medical', 'purposes', 'went', 'nature', 'solemnly', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'moments', 'interior', 'dialogue', 'entire', 'family', 'given', 'chance', 'speak', 'least', 'once', 'more', 'gotten', 'point', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'drag', 'Anna', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'hospital', 'hold', 'down', 'nurses', 'sedate', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'father', 'can', 'take.The', 'middle', 'child', 'son', 'Jesse', 'Evan', 'Ellingson', 'ignored', 'never', 'solitary', 'existence', 'dark', 'bus', 'stops', 'make', 'obvious', 'seriously', 'considering', 'why', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'sure', 'fire', 'attention', 'getter', 'Goodness', 'took', 'parents', 'long', 'enough', 'realize', 'was', 'explanation', 'academic', 'problems.And', 'what', 'Kate', 'whenever', 'focus', 'someone', 'illness', 'tend', 'forget', 'still', 'person', 'Sara', 'so', 'driven', 'save', 'Kate', 'life', 'never', 'consider', 'how', 'Kate', 'really', 'condition', 'understandable', 'mother', 'Sara', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'pain', 'burying', 'child', 'what', 'point', 'clear', 'nothing', 'left', 'hold', 'there', 'ever', 'time', 'when', 'better', 'let', 'someone', 'go', 'knowing', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'delaying', 'inevitable', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'cancer', 'killing', 'Kate', 'killing', 'family', 'Then', 'again', 'part', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'more', 'live', 'life', 'normal', 'teenager', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'shopping', 'hang', 'out', 'friends', 'date', 'Flashback', 'show', 'falling', 'love', 'cancer', 'patient', 'Taylor', 'Ambrose', 'Thomas', 'Dekker', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'Kate', 'feel', 'better.I', ""'m"", 'usually', 'wary', 'movies', ""'re"", 'inherently', 'manipulative', 'What', 'Sister', 'Keeper', 'far', 'better', 'average', 'tearjerker', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'manipulate', 'rather', 'so', 'subtler', 'more', 'believable', 'level', 'suppose', 'natural', 'question', 'certain', 'scenes', 'fact', 'when', ""'re"", 'right', 'middle', 'let', 'happen', 'hard', 'not', 'given', 'maturity', 'story', 'intensity', 'performances', 'believability', 'dialogue', 'end', 'film', 'guarantee', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dry', 'eye', 'house.Fortunately', 'film', 'heavy-handedness', ""'re"", 'not', 'being', 'forced', 'watch', 'shameless', 'melodrama', ""'re"", 'being', 'asked', 'engage', 'ethical', 'dilemma', 'determine', 'was', 'done', 'right', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'Is', 'right', 'conceive', 'child', 'donor', 'purposes', 'right', 'healthy', 'individual', 'deny', 'sick', 'individual', 'access', 'necessary', 'organs', 'there', 'point', 'modern', 'medicine', 'can', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'What', 'think', 'feel', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'only', 'what', 'think', 'feel', 'Sister', 'Keeper', 'powerful', 'intelligent', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'would', 'be']",My Sister's Keeper

The story begins with Anna Fitzgerald seeing a lawyer, Campbell Alexander, to sue her parents for the right to her own body. Anna was conceived to provide (initially) cord blood for her older sister Kate who has leukaemia. As she has grown up and as Kate's disease has progressed, more and more has been demanded of Anna's body for her sister. While a movie can never encompass all the content of a book, many of the main issues were covered in this film. Fans of the book will, however, very likely be disappointed with the ending: the twist that gave Picoult `s book the perfect ending was changed to a more Hollywood ending. Another drawback was the absence of one of Picoult's delightful humour devices in the book: all the purposes that Campbell comes up with for his dog, Judge. It also misses completely the angst of Anna and Kate's older brother, Jesse, as his life is put on hold for his sister. If you haven't read the book, you may well enjoy this movie.

Looking at what he did with John Q and Alpha Dog, and what he's done again recently with My Sister's Keeper; you can see he ensures we get to know each and every character in stories jam-packed with several of them.A box of Kleenex takes priority even above popcorn, as your companion while watching this film. I can almost guarantee that you will cry at least once. If you don't - sadly, chances are you may not have a soul!Anna Fitzgerald (Abigail Breslin) strolls into the office of well-known attorney, Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin) and proclaims that she would like to sue her parents for the rights to her own body. They have been forcing her for years, to be poked, prodded scanned and excessively examined by doctors. Why, you might ask? Because Anna's sister, Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) is dying of cancer. Their parents, Sara (Cameron Diaz) and Brian (Jason Patric) had Anna created in a test tube, for the sole purpose of being able to donate certain organs to her sister.Campbell agrees to take the case. Anna's mother is beyond upset when she discovers this, while her father tries to be more supportive. The person who is the most appreciative of what Anna's been going through? Her sister Kate.The Fitzgerald family has had it rough over the years to say the least. Kate's unfortunate situation has really put them through the ringer. As she shouldn't, Kate can't help but feel remorse and guilt for this. Her father has to work more hours; her mother had to give up her job as a lawyer to stay home and take care of her; Anna has been victimized by hospitals countless times; her brother Jesse (Evan Ellingson), is often left forgotten about by both parents, and of course, she herself is dying.Things do pick up for her a little though, when she meets a cute boy during one of her many hospital visits. Taylor (Thomas Dekker) is also dying of cancer, and wishes to spend his final days on earth with her. It's no wonder that Nick Cassavetes knows romance as well as drama; after all, he also directed The Notebook.I won't tell you any more of what happens, but I will say that it is all very entertaining and emotionally gut-wrenching. I have heard it's devastatingly far from the book, and some fans were not happy. Having not read it yet, I can only say it stands alone as a great film, whether it differs from that version of this story or not.The acting is remarkable. Some of the best performances of the year can be found in this film, and there are a ton of them. It's because of this, that the next several paragraphs exist, so please bear with me.Abigail Breslin and Sofia Vassilieva could very well be watching the Oscars live, from the first few rows, come this March 7th. They are both believable as sisters and furthermore they have us convinced they love each other dearly. We've seen plenty of Abigail Breslin over the last few years to know that she is going places with her career, so let's take a minute to discuss new-comer Sofia Vassilieva.She will tear your heart in half, in this film. She is a beautiful person, in every way that one can be beautiful and it almost seems like she is this dying young girl. Expect to be seeing much more of her.Jason Patric delivers (at least from what I have seen him in) his best performance to date. The scene where he tells his wife that if she doesn't come to the beach with him and the kids, he wants a divorce - was incredible. He is a terrific actor who chooses his roles very wisely.While I may not agree with everything he says outside of a movie theater, Alec Baldwin is always enjoyable to watch. He has shown several new sides of himself this year, especially in this film and in It's Complicated. It's no wonder the Academy honored him with an invitation to host the Oscars. I look forward to seeing him then, as well.Evan Ellingson did a great job playing the kid that mom and dad tend to forget about. You get that he has his own issues, but puts them aside because he loves his sisters and realizes that theirs may be of greater importance.Thomas Dekker was like a young Brad Pitt, coming in mid-movie and sweeping Kate off her feet, as Taylor. Their scenes together weren't very long, but they were a huge part of the film.The film's third potential Oscar nominee is Joan Cusack. She plays the judge that is to oversee Anna's case. She's a woman who suffered a tragedy that will haunt her forever and she carries its burden on her face for the world to see. I have seen Cusack in plenty of films and I've never seen her anywhere near where she was here. She conveys so much emotion and anguish with her eyes alone, I was baffled.If you're thinking I was saving Cameron Diaz for the last, because she is the biggest star in the film, or due to her acting being extra-stellar, you can guess again. As it will to many, it came as a huge surprise to me, that she is my only complaint in the film.I'm under the impression she may actually be far better at comedy than drama. I think she's a great deal more believable and enjoyable in films like There's Something about Mary and The Sweetest Thing. While I do admire her for stepping out of those types of roles that can be like death-traps for so many talented actresses (meaning they just keep making the same romantic comedy again and again), I wish she would do more of them.I also want to give her some credit for shaving her head, but I'm not sure if she actually did it or not! I know the character does and we see a shot of her in the mirror shaving away; but it's a quick shot and it seems like she's wearing plastic or something in the other scenes. If she did, then my hat is off to her. If she didn't, well then I guess she wouldn't need my hat, now would she?",4,My Sister's Keeper Review,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,6162,"['SISTER', 'KEEPERSTARRING', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Cameron',

However, This is suppose to be a story about a little girl fighting for the rights to her own body. They made it into just another sad cancer movie. This kids parents basically had her so they could take certain body parts and give them to her dying sister. That's really messed up. Even though you understand why, it's still just plain wrong. We see this little girl fighting for a normal life. I was captivated by this story until the end. All of a sudden we find out she doesn't really care of they give her body parts to her sister.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[8, 10]","Like the stubborn curmudgeon I am, I keep thinking that with each viewing of MY SISTER'S KEEPER I will finally be able to keep the emotions this film releases at arm's length and watch the movie strictly on its merits.  What an idiot I am.  Having viewed this film numerous times, I am just as emotionally moved--and drained--as I was when I first saw it in the cinema--when I sat a few rows back from a distraught teen girl who sobbed hysterically during the last half hour.Sure, there are countless movies about disease, suffering, familial conflict, and death; so why does MY SISTER'S KEEPER strike such a resolute emotional chord?  For me, it has to do with the five members of the Fitzgerald family; not only are they totally believable--in their actions and interactions--but they connect with the audience, and the film respects each character enough to allow him or her to be fully vetted and explored.  The plot is, quite simply, titanic:  Anna (Abigail Breslin), an 11-year-old girl who is a test tube baby brought into the world to donate body parts for her cancer-stricken sister, Kate (Sofia Vassilieva), suddenly retains an attorney (Alec Baldwin in, for once, a very likable role) to sue for medical emancipation from her parents, Sara and Brian (Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric).  Of course the lawsuit throws the Fitzgeralds into further disarray, yet the story moves along beautifully despite all the conflict and turmoil, especially in the form of numerous flashbacks that serve to fill in the blanks for a family ultimately bonded--however dysfunctionally--through love.I was, and am, extraordinarily moved by this film, whether it be via Anna's yearning for innocence lost, Brian's remarkable love and devotion to all of his family, brother Jesse's (Evan Ellingson) inner turmoil, or Sara's profound determination to save her daughter's life--no matter what the cost to the rest of the family.  Through the depictions of these characters we forget we are watching a film; instead we feel we are privy to a front row seat as the Fitzgeralds struggle through an experience that can either bring them all together--or drive them forever apart.  As compelling as it is poignant, MY SISTER'S KEEPER is an exceptional examination of human interaction and tragedy, with a silver lining of love and recollection.

1223228,A28S3F43F76HSH,B001OQCV1K,"D. Sorel ""book lovah""","[2, 3]","Based on the book by Jodi Picoult, My Sister's Keeper tells the story of a family on the brink of ruin. While sister Kate sits in the hospital preparing to die from her last battle with leukemia, her younger sister Andromeda is suing their parents for the fight to make her own decisions on her body. The back story: When Kate was under five years old, she was diagnosed with leukemia and there was no match for blood transfusions or organ donations. Therefore, Kate's mother and father decided to have a daughter who genetically matched Kate from whom the parents could harvest her organs and blood to ensure that Kate lived. This worked perfectly for about 11-12 years until Andromeda (the created daughter) decided that she wanted control over her own body and did not want to be subjected to tests and harvests. Of course this threw the entire family into shock and divided all members. If you are a reader of Jodi Picoult, you know that there is a twist to every story. However, this twist is not nearly as powerful on screen as it was on the page. Yet, that seems to be the motto for this film: read the book instead!!In fact, there is little in common between the film and the book. Though the names are the same and the fact that one daughter sues the family for her medical rights is also the same, little else is. In this novel, there are in fact two twists that occur. Yet, the movie only showed one and the more boring one at that. If you have read the book, you would be outraged at the happy ending that the movie presents. In addition, the characters in the film are presented with much more heart and compassion than the cut-throat mom and extremely distant father in the novel. It seems as if none of the cast and crew even read the book. Instead, you would probably find dozens of copies of the novel being used as doorstops throughout the studio. Ironically, it is the movie that should find an alternative use.

But here goes.The movie is loosely based on the eponymous book by Jodi Picoult. If you're expecting prety much the same storyline, you will be disappointed. One character is omitted from the movie which removes any possibility of another having a love interest. But it might have made the movie even more convoluted and sentimental.Anna (Abigail Breslin) is an eleven-year-old who was conceived as a ""designer baby,"" that is a perfect genetic match for her sister Kate, who has leukemia.  When it looks like she'll have to donate a kidney, she decides to sue her parents for medical emancipation, using a famous lawyer (Alec Baldwin).  Mom hits the roof (which is an understatement), Dad begins to wonder if he should have stepped in sooner, and Jesse, the brother, leads a secret life, which is easy since no one pays attention to him.  Joan Cusack plays the judge who will have to decide Anna's case.There's also an adorable dog, who seems to be the only one having any fun in the movie.All the actors do a good job, and their angst is always backlit in a soft golden glow with lots of stirring music in the background. When they go to the beach, the sand is free of trash and the seagulls wheel and dip against a bright blue sky.  The perfect place to ponder the fragility of life.  It's not the actors' fault the direction is so heavy-handed; all of them deserve much better.You will likely cry, but you may also feel, to quote one reviewer, that your tear ducts have been hijacked.

Though the story seems perfect for  ""Lifetime"" movie, several members of the Cast lift the overall quality of things. Abigail Breslin is perfect as the daughter conceived for spare parts who has had enough while Alec Baldwin is the ideal fit as a sleazy lawyer. The best performance is given by Joan Cusack in a brief role as a Judge who has understands tragedy in and out of the courtroom. Evan Elligson is also good in his role as the neglected son but his role is truncated in the film. Sofia Vassilleva is OK as the cancer-stricken daughter, but the role is written in such a martyr-like manner that it blocks out some of the sympathy. Jason Patric (who has held up well) as the hunky super-Dad does'nt have much to do but when he finally stands up to his wife, it is a great ""Ah-Ha"" moment. But the film founders badly on the performance of Cameron Diaz in a dramatic role as the cold, driven Sarah, the Matriarch.

The acting is wonderful. All of the kids are great in their respective roles, but the two girls are absolutely heart wrenching. It is a painful story of life, illness and the effects of illness on a family. It is a tough movie to watch, especially if you know anyone who has been through cancer. I can say, as much as I enjoyed the movie, I doubt I will see it again, it is just too sad, too much reality.From the perspective of having read the book, I was horribly disappointed. It took what was an amazing story with a killer twist at the ending and made it into just a sad, heart wrenching cancer movie with a different story line regarding the lawsuit. The twist ending is what MADE the book! I understand that changes have to be made, different plotlines have to be left out in the interest of time, but to completely change the point of the book....I think that's wrong.

The casting was very well done; the cinematography and the choreography enhance the quality of the picture. The acting was very convincing, too. The plot moves along at a good pace for the first half-hour or so but after that things do slow down; they could have cut a few minutes once or twice to truly make this a taut drama. That is a disappointment.When the action starts, we meet the members of the Fitzgerald family who endure endless emotional angst and suffering because tragically one of the Fitzgerald children, Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) is very ill with cancer--yet again. Now that Kate's kidneys have failed her; Kate's life is in immediate jeopardy. We also meet Kate's sister Anna (Abigail Breslin) who was a tube baby created for the purpose of contributing one thing or another from her own body to save Kate's life repeatedly throughout the years. Cameron Diaz plays Sara Fitzgerald, a mother who bravely scraps her lucrative career as a lawyer to take care of her daughter Kate at any cost and there's Kate's father Brian (Jason Patric).Although Anna has given blood, bone marrow and more in the past to keep her sister Kate alive, all of a sudden Anna throws the family into complete turmoil when she hires crackerjack lawyer Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin) to win medical emancipation from her parents. Sara and Brian are stunned, to say the least; Sara is furious with Anna, too. The ensuing court scenes with Judge De Salvo (Joan Cusack) are quite memorable.But if the scenes with Judge De Salvo in the courtroom are memorable, the depiction we get of Kate's cancer is absolutely remarkable and generally rather accurate. As a cancer survivor myself, I saw some mild exaggeration of what a cancer patient goes through on chemotherapy (believe me, if the patient is throwing up THAT much, the doctor would at least try to switch chemo drugs); and although I was on Rituxan I have never heard of ""Rituxan on the breath."" However, the rest of Kate's cancer and its treatments are rather accurate. We do see what poor Kate has to endure and it can be just awful; although we do see Kate have a sweet, moving relationship with Taylor (Thomas Dekker), another young leukemia patient.Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. What will Anna eventually decide to do--will she drop her legal case for medical emancipation from her parents and give Kate the kidney she needs to live; or will Anna not want to risk the very real lifelong complications from a kidney surgery and stand firm, refusing to give up one of her kidneys? What about Sara and Brian Fitzgerald--how will they cope with Anna who wants to thwart them, her own parents, to go against their wishes and not help her sister Kate stay alive? What happens in the courtroom--what will Judge De Salvo ultimately decide? Is there any other reason why Anna won't give her kidney to Kate? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!My Sister's Keeper is not a bad movie at all; it pushed my buttons as a former social worker, a cancer survivor and an adult child of a family with a lot of health problems to handle. The movie is definitely a tearjerker; and it will stay in your mind for quite some while after you see it. The acting is wonderful as well. Admittedly, it could have been edited a little more to make it tighter after the first half-hour; and that's something of a disappointment. After all is said and done, however, I do recommend this film; it's a sensitive portrait of a family in crisis that has meaning and that's a big plus.",4,bring along some tissues,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,3785,"['Sister', 'Keeper', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'adult', 'child', 'family', 'someone', 'had', 'serious', 'ongoing', 'health', 'problems', 'former', 'social', 'worker', 'cancer', 'survivor', 'who', 'beat', 'advanced', 'form', 'disease', 'mighty', 'big', 'odds', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'enhance', 'quality', 'picture', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'too', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'first', 'half-hour', 'so', 'things', 'do', 'slow', 'down', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'few', 'minutes', 'once', 'twice', 'truly', 'make', 'taut', 'drama', 'disappointment.When', 'action', 'meet', 'members', 'Fitzgerald', 'family', 'who', 'endure', 'endless', 'emotional', 'angst', 'suffering', 'tragically', 'one', 'Fitzgerald', 'children', 'Kate', 'Sofia', 'Vassilieva', 'very', 'ill', 'cancer', 'yet', 'again', 'Now', 'Kate', 'kidneys', 'have', 'failed', 'Kate', 'life', 'immediate', 'jeopardy', 'also', 'meet', 'Kate', 'sister', 'Anna', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'who', 'was', 'tube', 'baby', 'created', 'purpose', 'contributing', 'one', 'thing', 'own', 'body', 'save', 'Kate', 'life', 'repeatedly', 'years', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Sara', 'Fitzgerald', 'mother', 'who', 'bravely', 'lucrative', 'career', 'lawyer', 'take', 'care', 'daughter', 'Kate', 'cost', 'Kate', 'father', 'Brian', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Anna', 'given', 'blood', 'bone', 'marrow', 'more', 'past', 'keep', 'sister', 'Kate', 'alive', 'sudden', 'Anna', 'family', 'complete', 'turmoil', 'when', 'crackerjack', 'lawyer', 'Campbell', 'Alexander', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'win', 'medical', 'emancipation', 'parents', 'Sara', 'Brian', 'are', 'stunned', 'say', 'least', 'Sara', 'furious', 'Anna', 'too', 'ensuing', 'court', 'scenes', 'Judge', 'De', 'Salvo', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'are', 'quite', 'memorable.But', 'scenes', 'Judge', 'De', 'Salvo', 'courtroom', 'are', 'memorable', 'depiction', 'get', 'Kate', 'cancer', 'absolutely', 'remarkable', 'generally', 'rather', 'accurate', 'cancer', 'survivor', 'saw', 'mild', 'exaggeration', 'what', 'cancer', 'patient', 'chemotherapy', 'believe', 'patient', 'throwing', 'up', 'THAT', 'much', 'doctor', 'would', 'least', 'try', 'switch', 'chemo', 'drugs', 'was', 'Rituxan', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Rituxan', 'breath', 'However', 'rest', 'Kate', 'cancer', 'treatments', 'are', 'rather', 'accurate', 'do', 'see', 'what', 'poor', 'Kate', 'endure', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'awful', 'do', 'see', 'Kate', 'have', 'sweet', 'moving', 'relationship', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'Dekker', 'young', 'leukemia', 'patient.Of', 'course', 'here', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'What', 'will', 'Anna', 'eventually', 'decide', 'do', 'will', 'drop', 'legal', 'case', 'medical', 'emancipation', 'parents', 'give', 'Kate', 'kidney', 'live', 'will', 'Anna', 'not', 'want', 'risk', 'very', 'real', 'lifelong', 'complications', 'kidney', 'surgery', 'stand', 'firm', 'refusing', 'give', 'up', 'one', 'kidneys', 'What', 'Sara', 'Brian', 'Fitzgerald', 'how', 'will', 'cope', 'Anna', 'who', 'thwart', 'own', 'parents', 'go', 'wishes', 'not', 'help', 'sister', 'Kate', 'stay', 'alive', 'What', 'courtroom', 'what', 'will', 'Judge', 'De', 'Salvo', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'Is', 'there', 'other', 'reason', 'why', 'Anna', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'kidney', 'Kate', 'No', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'Sister', 'Keeper', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'pushed', 'buttons', 'former', 'social', 'worker', 'cancer', 'survivor', 'adult', 'child', 'family', 'lot', 'health', 'problems', 'handle', 'movie', 'definitely', 'tearjerker', 'will', 'stay', 'mind', 'quite', 'while', 'see', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'Admittedly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'little', 'more', 'make', 'tighter', 'first', 'half-hour', 'something', 'disappointment', 'said', 'done', 'however', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'sensitive', 'portrait', 'family', 'crisis', 'meaning', 'big', 'plus']",My Sister's Keeper

I wasn't.A child with leukemia is tough subject matter no matter what format one uses to convey the story. Both the novel and the film had flaws, but neither had the flaw of storytelling. Anyone with an interest in family dynamics and can stomach the truly heart-wrenching drama of how disease interferes with the dream of a perfect family, will find meaning in this film. If the material is too sensitive--too painful--stay away.The flaw I found in the book was the lack of physical character description. This, by the way, is evident in nearly all the Picoult novels I've read. The film version of My Sister's Keeper, of course, gives one faces and voices. The acting--particularly by Sophia Vassilieva (Kate) and Abigail Breslin (Anna) certainly adds to the poignancy and the story. ** I didn't go through as many tissues while reading.** But overall, I didn't like the adaptation--the indecision on behalf of the writers on whether or not to stick to the individual characters' first-person narratives (as they do in the opening scenes) or to take it to a series of present-day scenario to a series of flashbacks. The ending was also changed.Overall, even though it's not a film I'd watch again, I'm glad I saw it--especially to put faces on the characters.

Could a physician ever dare to suggest such route of having birth with the intent to supply genetically matching organs (even if that was technically possible)? Those were the main reasons that undermined the convinciblity of the scenario.The residing judge was a great actor and played a convincing role. The same could be said on the desperate mother who could not let her dear daughter separate from life. The dad's role was also well done with the background of a humble and charismatic firefighter that rendered dad's role real.Another inconvenient glitch was the daughter who sought a lawyer and sued her own mother in order to end her abuse. That was unconvincing even if the community was so enlightening that it could educate a child of the role of the State on such matters.As for the two cancer patients indulging in sex that appeared far fetched. One assumes that a terminally sick patient would be more occupied with survival than  productivity.The cold and dry role of the medical staff was bit of exaggeration as far as calculation of genetic manipulation and discharge of a not very sick patient. To the injury was added the dog ""Judge"". An attorney accompanied by a dog in a court trial and calling his dog ""Judge"" was excessive humor.When many pieces of the puzzle do not fit, the finger points to the manipulators of the story.

So skip half of these reviews, and read this one---it IS about the movie by itself.This is a major league tear-jerker, as it should be. It is good to see a big screen portrayal of the horror and pain inflicted when a child becomes sick. Although we have made huge strides in medicine, I cannot help but to believe that it's borderline barbaric to make a child sicker in order to increase the odds of survival. Having said that, what else can any of us do in a similar circumstance? NOTHING. You live by instinct and emotion---doing the logical or ""right thing"" is impossible because nobody knows what that is. This is but one portrayal of what such a family might go through.I believe all the actors here did a marvelous job. Cameron Diaz surprised me; she plays a Mother having multiple internal conflicts, and she plays it very well IMO. Sofia Vassilieva is absolutely terrific as the poor beautiful soul cursed with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Where do these young actors come from?! Amazing. Alec Baldwin, my personal dislike aside, gets my utmost respect here. He's just one of the best at playing these parts, and he certainly showed up for the job during this movie. Btw, I mention the dislike angle to illustrate that the man's acting abilities go a long way to counteract such views. I hope he's around for a long time.I found the medical emancipation issue quite interesting and new to think about. Although a lot of time was spent on it---maybe it shouldn't have been, it could be that the movie would have been too weak without that extra baggage. Still though, it seemed to flow fine with this reviewer. Another thing that struck me, and I believe it is important to keep it in one's mind, is that events such as these are life's great equalizers. No amount of wealth, power, or connections can make one's life any better when you are dealt one of these hands. You are simply a sitting duck, waiting for fate to do what it's going to do.The blu-ray edition (at least my rental version) does not have a special features section. This was one film where I missed that immensely; I would have enjoyed seeing interviews of the young actors, to see how they prepared, and how they kept themselves from drowning in the subject matter mentally. For the adult actors (Cameron and Jason Patric), I cannot imagine spending a dozen hours or more every day being immersed in this subject matter.

1223275,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001OQCV1K,RMurray847,"[8, 12]","Let me be very clear right from the start:  I hated Jodi Picoult's bestselling novel MY SISTER'S KEEPER.  It suffered from two things.  One, Picoult is one of those writer's who loves to bounce around from narrator to narrator so that we can get EVERY SINGLE FLIPPIN' thought from EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in the book.  A character's actions and behaviors are never enough to enlighten us, we must be beaten over the head with their innermost ramblings...all of which sound like they come from the same person, whether a 10 year old girl, a teenage boy, an attorney or a firefighter.  Two, the ending was truly, truly awful.  I can handle endings that are not what I might have hoped for (e.g. a sad ending when I had  my fingers crossed for something happy)..but when a book ends with an event so random, so unlikely and so much a cop-out, I want to scream.So I reluctantly agreed to attend the movie of MY SISTER'S KEEPER because the two lovely ladies in my life wanted to go.  While I didn't want to scream at the end (mostly because the ending is VERY different...sorry if that's a spoiler for you, even though it's been the subject of much discussion in virtually every review of the film), I still didn't like the film all that much.As a toddler, Kate Fitzgerald is diagnosed with cancer.  For years, her parents understandably fight for her life.  But early in the treatment, they make an ethically gray decision.  To give birth to another child, but one that has been ""engineered"" to provide excellent matches as a potential donor of everything from blood to marrow.  Thus, when Anna Fitzgerald comes into the world, she is already saddled with a heavy responsibility.  Her mother Sara has little time for her, other than in her role as donor, because she is so fiercely working to save Kate.  Her firefighter father does his best to be a balanced presence, but sometimes the more demanding voices of others in his family undo his efforts.  Kate and Anna have an older brother, Evan, who is mostly just ignored by the rest of his family.  All in all, the Fitzgerald household is full of stress and bottled-up emotions.Everything begins to come to a head when Anna decides she does not want to donate a kidney to her sister.  She's had enough of being used (without even being asked)...and she finds an attorney to take her side.  Needless to say, her rather dramatic gesture is met with a wide range of emotions, particularly by her mother, who no longer understands anything in her life other than her battle to keep Kate alive.  She can see no other side to any issue.The movie plays out all this turmoil, but is heavily reliant on extended flashbacks, particularly of Kate and her battle.  These flashbacks are almost entirely geared towards squeezing tears from the audience.  While it is undeniable that they often do, the tears are also cheap and manipulative.  One extended flashback shows how Kate meets a dying teenage boy and the romance that blossoms.  You know FROM THE START that things cannot end happily.  So the flashback is just a long exercise in wringing emotion from us.One thing Picoult's novel worked hard on was to be about the ethical conflict.  Did Anna have a right to decide for herself about whether she could donate a kidney?  Was it RIGHT for her to feel that way?  What did her parents owe to HER?  What about the forgotten brother?  And so forth.  It was poorly written, but at least she understood that this made her work unique.  The movie is mostly about the dying girl.  The lawsuit feels tangential for much of the movie as we're asked to cry and feel bad for everyone.  Again, we DO feel bad and many, many people were sobbing at the end of this film.  In fact, I've never heard such emotion from a theater audience.  My eyes got wet.  And why not?  Watching a lovely teenage girl die from a horrible cancer is going to get me upset even if it is poorly done in a Lifetime TV movie.  When talented people work to such ends, it will be even more effective.But the film is simply a wallow...and that is NOT a pleasant feeling.  It seems to have nothing to say...particularly with the new ending.  I guess the lesson is:  a dying girl is a bummer.  I don't mean to sound cavalier or insensitive...but from a pure movie-going standpoint, that IS what the film is about.Too bad, too.  There are many excellent performances.  Abigail Breslin is very nice as Anna and Sofia Vassilieva is practically radiant as the stricken Kate.  I have enjoyed her on TV's MEDIUM, and it's nice to see her playing with the ""big boys.""  It's not her fault that she's written to be practically a saint.  Alec Baldwin is his usual amusing self.  And Jason Patric is best of all in a restrained, soft-spoken but powerful performance.  He is so seldom in movies anymore, and many of them are lousy.  He often looks bored...as though his striking jawbones can do all the acting for him.  But he's loose and convincing here...he should consider taking on more ""blue collar"" roles, I think.  They seem to suit him now that he's aged a little.Cameron Diaz tries really hard, and she has some good moments...but for me, the strain to be ""Oscar worthy"" is etched on her face.  Her performance doesn't feel natural, it feels like work.  She was much more balanced in her semi-dramatic turn in IN HER SHOES.While the acting is pretty good, I can't honestly recommend this film.  It is too manipulative.  The ending is far, far too tidy.  I guess if you want to burn through a box of Kleenex, you might like it.  Otherwise, I'd avoid it.",3,A wallow in sadness for no particular purpose.,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,5545,"['Let', 'be', 'very', 'clear', 'right', 'start', 'hated', 'Jodi', 'Picoult',

The premise is incredibly thought provoking, so terribly sad, and downright scary, not only that people could act this way but in knowing that this is happening. People are having children for their parts. I can understand the terror when a child is dying, and the feeling and desperation of being willing to do anything to save them, but I didn't understand either in the book or film the complete lack of caring for Anna or about her or what it felt like to be considered a nonperson in her own right, but just a supply shop for Kate. I never really felt that Sarah loved Anna that much, if at all. I was sickened by the scene in the courtroom where Sarah is screaming at Anna, berating her for not wanting to give up a part of her body, asking what was wrong with Anna. I didn't know until the end why Anna refused, but I think in any event, Anna had a right to refuse to be forced to be a parts shop for Kate simply on the grounds that she is a human being, even though I know she loved Kate dearly. I would have really liked to know how the judge would have ruled, and whether she would have thought that forcing Anna to give up her organs was abuse, and possibly remove Anna, or go along with it.I didn't at all like the ending in the book. It felt immensely contrived and false. I never understood how a kidney transplant would save Kate, since she had cancer, not kidney disease. How could a new kidney destroy the cancer? I thought the ending of the film was much more realistic and natural. I also know why I have avoided seeing Cameron Diaz in anything up til now and plan to go back to that avoidance. I hated every scene she was in, especially the ones where she acted like an absolute insane woman, example, when the father was going to take Kate to the beach.  I thought that was such a beautiful thing for him to do, to let his dying child see the beach one last time. It seems as though by that point, Kate didn't even matter anymore, as a person, with wants and needs, to Sarah.  It was just about Sarah winnning the battle, no matter the cost to Kate, to Anna, to their family, and that was just scary. It isn't called catastrophic disease for nothin, it is like a bomb going off for the whole family, but it was horrible to see Sarah in effect step over the bodies of Anna, the brother, the husband, for Kate, and then even stop really seeing Kate.

The overly emotional exchanges and tearful drama appear so frequently that anticipating the next bout of sobbing becomes a game much like the jumpy scares of a horror film. Though the acting never falters, several direction choices such as constantly changing narrators and ill-suited musical accompaniments detract from the overall effect of this mostly-poignant weepfest. Misery may love company, but when you're in the company of this much misery, it's difficult to maintain an appropriate connection.Since her birth, Anna Fitzgerald (Abigail Breslin) has undergone constant sacrifices to help keep her sister Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) alive. From blood to bone marrow, she has given whatever is needed to fend off the impending tragedy of her sister's leukemia. But upon the necessity of a kidney transplant, Anna decides she has had enough and hires famously outspoken lawyer Campbell Alexander (Alec Baldwin) to win medical emancipation from her domineering mother (Cameron Diaz). But as this new confrontation collides with Kate's steadily declining condition, the Fitzgeralds must come together as a family before a guarded secret destroys them completely.Under the foundation of happy family life reside many cracks, resentments, depression and dysfunction; especially when a deadly disease threatens to disrupt all sense of normalcy and happiness. But we got that from the first ten minutes of the film. So the next couple hours involving one saddening moment trumped by another heartbreaking episode grows tiresome very quickly. A unique premise may lurk amongst the tear-jerking scenes, but it just isn't much fun to watch. Important themes and thought-provoking subject matter can't prevent My Sister's Keeper from being little more than weeping, bleeding and music video montages.It's a realistic and heavy-hitting drama with several outstanding performances. Abigail Breslin is, as usual, awfully mature for her age, Alec Baldwin brings a charming sense of ethics to the table as a charismatic lawyer, and Joan Cusack provides an understandably biased source of justice. It's undoubtedly tough to deal with cancer, not just for the sick but for their family; as demonstrated in the film, the parental attention is unfairly split up between the children. It's quite an emotional event, but with such a looming preoccupation with death and children coming to terms with mortality, the entertainment value is just as bleak as the plot. Even the lighter scenes are tinged with a depressing melancholy as if foreshadowing the next tearful segment. Just when it couldn't get any sadder, it does.- The Massie Twins",3,My Sister's Keeper Review from The Massie Twins,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,2855,"['Sister', 'Keeper', 'situations', 'lives', 'family', 'so', 'depressingly', 'wounded', 'not', 'exactly', 'dysfunctional', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Anna', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'often', 'difficult', 'relate', 'sympathize', 'overly', 'emotional', 'exchanges', 'tearful', 'drama', 'appear', 'so', 'frequently', 'anticipating', 'next', 'bout', 'sobbing', 'becomes', 'game', 'much', 'jumpy', 'scares', 'horror', 'film', 'acting', 'never', 'falters', 'several', 'direction', 'choices', 'such', 'constantly', 'changing', 'narrators', 'ill-suited', 'musical', 'accompaniments', 'detract', 'overall', 'effect', 'mostly-poignant', 'weepfest', 'Misery', 'may', 'love', 'company', 'when', ""'re"", 'company', 'much', 'misery', 'difficult', 'maintain', 'appropriate', 'connection.Since', 'birth', 'Anna', 'Fitzgerald', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'undergone', 'constant', 'sacrifices', 'help', 'keep', 'sister', 'Kate', 'Sofia', 'Vassilieva', 'alive', 'blood', 'bone', 'marrow', 'given', 'needed', 'fend', 'off', 'impending', 'tragedy', 'sister', 'leukemia', 'necessity', 'kidney', 'transplant', 'Anna', 'had', 'enough', 'famously', 'outspoken', 'lawyer', 'Campbell', 'Alexander', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'win', 'medical', 'emancipation', 'domineering', 'mother', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'new', 'confrontation', 'collides', 'Kate', 'steadily', 'declining', 'condition', 'Fitzgeralds', 'must', 'come', 'together', 'family', 'guarded', 'secret', 'completely.Under', 'foundation', 'happy', 'family', 'life', 'reside', 'many', 'cracks', 'resentments', 'depression', 'dysfunction', 'especially', 'when', 'deadly', 'disease', 'disrupt', 'sense', 'normalcy', 'happiness', 'got', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'next', 'couple', 'hours', 'involving', 'one', 'saddening', 'moment', 'trumped', 'heartbreaking', 'episode', 'tiresome', 'very', 'quickly', 'unique', 'premise', 'may', 'lurk', 'amongst', 'tear-jerking', 'scenes', 'just', ""n't"", 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Important', 'themes', 'thought-provoking', 'subject', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'My', 'Sister', 'Keeper', 'being', 'little', 'more', 'weeping', 'bleeding', 'music', 'video', 'montages.It', 'realistic', 'heavy-hitting', 'drama', 'several', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'usual', 'awfully', 'mature', 'age', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'charming', 'sense', 'ethics', 'table', 'charismatic', 'lawyer', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'understandably', 'biased', 'source', 'justice', 'undoubtedly', 'tough', 'deal', 'cancer', 'not', 'just', 'sick', 'family', 'demonstrated', 'film', 'parental', 'attention', 'unfairly', 'split', 'up', 'children', 'quite', 'emotional', 'event', 'such', 'looming', 'preoccupation', 'death', 'children', 'coming', 'terms', 'mortality', 'entertainment', 'value', 'just', 'as', 'bleak', 'plot', 'Even', 'lighter', 'scenes', 'are', 'tinged', 'depressing', 'melancholy', 'foreshadowing', 'next', 'tearful', 'segment', 'Just', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'sadder', 'Massie', 'Twins']",My Sister's Keeper
