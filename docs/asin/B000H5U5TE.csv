1009782,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B000H5U5TE,"JJD ""John""","[8, 9]","For the uninitiated, these five Canadians are the standard to which all other sketch comedy acts must follow.Most people know them for Mark McKinney's ""Head Crushing"" bits or Scott Thompson's Buddy Cole monologues. The fact of the matter is that they are so much more than a few memorable catch phrases. Their irreverant humor and ability to find a laugh in the most incredibly mundane situations makes them comedic masterminds. There is nary a dull point in all of their seasons. Some may be quite funnier than others, but they are a joy to watch nonetheless. There is chemistry here...and in spades.One particular favorite is watching Dave Foley as a lounge pianist who doesn't know a single note on the piano..and he sings about his shortcomings with such glee. Enter Kevin McDonald, who glides across the piano, his lankey frame sporting a sequinned coctail dress. He knows he's not a singer, but like Foley, he sings of his own ineptitude so horribly off key. In about a 60 second bit, they have me rolling. It's so bizarre, yet undeniably hypnotic. That remains my single favorite moment in the whole of the series, and I laugh about it to this day (16 years later).Other faves include...Bruce McCullough's open letter to the guy that stole his bicycle wheel..and his open letter to the people that watched the guy steal his bicycle wheel.Dave Foley as Kevin's pet demon who just want's someone to talk to.Scott Thompson's ""Running Faggot"".Mark McKinney as a French Canadian pyromaniac office employee.The list goes on...If you haven't given these guys much attention, then you missed out on the best sketch comedy show since Lorne Michaels introduced us to Belushi and company 30 plus years ago.

This set is a must-have (whether you buy it as a set or individually). The recurring characters are especially hilarious from the very first episode: Chicken Lady, Buddy Cole, Cathy and Kathy, Thirty Helens, the Headcrusher, Bellini, Simon and Hecubus, ""He's Hip.."", the Cops, Queen Elizabeth, and I know I forgot a ton of others. They are all priceless. One of the sketches that always cracks me up is when Scott Thompson's character decides he wants to be an Indian woman. I don't know why, it just does. Bruce McCulloch's annoying kid Gavin is awesome as are Simon and Hecubus (""EVIL!""). And the one where Kevin and Dave are trappers in an office building. I could go on and on, it is impossible to pick one favorite. Then there are their monologues...absolutely priceless!

I loved The Kids in the Hall when they debuted over twenty years ago untill they ended some five years later.  They are not for everybody but I think they have something for everyone.  They did some weird stuff back then.  For instance the Cabbage Head guy, the chicken woman, the head squasher etc.  The office ladies were pretty funny, actually anytime they put dresses on which was often they were pretty funny, and they did not look like to bad of chicks either.  If you were a fan back then this set is worth having.  Nothing was off limits for the kids, from sex,race,gays,death,religion and so on and so on.  They were all over the place.
