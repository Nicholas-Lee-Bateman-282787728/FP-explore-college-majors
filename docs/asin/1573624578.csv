My initial assessment remains accurate today even though the politicizing of James Carville now repulses me. This documentary fulfills every expectation. It takes a snapshot at an isolated point in time and conveys a bevy of information about an era. We discover (or re-discover as the case may be) Bill Clinton along with the folks who orchestrated his 1992 campaign. ""The War Room"" also is an excellent primary source document and a fine piece of history. It remains topical as some of the same figures graced Senator Clinton's run for the Democratic Party nomination in 2008. As many of these magnates were a part of the Clinton Administration (albeit briefly), the movie yields considerable insight on an era--perhaps far more than the future president would have liked. D.A. Pennebaker is highly esteemed by his peers and we see here that this is for solid reasons.

190282,A1S3C5OFU508P3,1573624578,Charles Ashbacher,"[4, 4]","While I found the glimpses into the inner workings of the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton to be interesting and well worth watching, it was a bit disappointing. Campaign manager James Carville and Communications Director George Stephanopoulos demonstrate their skills at political maneuvering. Even though Bill Clinton was a masterful politician, these two men got him elected. While both of them show their hard-boiled political fronts, they also show their human sides. Stephanopoulos openly talks about how nervous he is and Carville cries when he thanks the staff for their hard work.There are two main weaknesses to the presentation. The first is that many parts will be incomprehensible to anyone who does not already know a great deal about the events. For example, there is mention of the relationship between Carville and Mary Matalin, but it is never truly explained. The incongruity of the political strategists of Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican George Bush having a romantic relationship in the middle of a presidential campaign is not emphasized as much as it should. If you were not aware of the depth of that relationship and who they are, then that segment will be little more than a flyby.The second main weakness is that your perspective never reaches the level of the ""fly on the wall."" At all times, it is clear that you are seeing into the campaign only to the extent that they want you to see. It would have been better if they at least sometimes made it appear that you were seeing workings of the campaign staff that they would have preferred not be seen. I was especially disappointed with the response to the Gennifer Flowers incident. Clinton and his campaign staff handled it very deftly, yet we really don't see what they did. This contrasts with an incident later in the campaign when Stephanopoulos fields a call from someone who is threatening to expose what they claim is another Clinton infidelity. In this case, he supposedly fathered a child with a black woman. Stephanopoulos tells the person politely but firmly that:*) At this point no one cares.*) If you break the story, you will never work in the Democratic party again.I found this video fascinating, but I remembered and understood the events that unfolded. If you for any reason do not know the fundamentals of what is happening, then you will spend a great deal of time puzzled by what you see.",4,Sometimes you need to fill in the gaps,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,2407,"['found', 'glimpses', 'inner', 'workings', '1992', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'be', 'interesting', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'Campaign', 'manager', 'James', 'Carville', 'Communications', 'Director', 'George', 'Stephanopoulos', 'demonstrate', 'skills', 'political', 'maneuvering', 'Even', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'was', 'masterful', 'politician', 'two', 'men', 'got', 'elected', 'show', 'hard-boiled', 'political', 'fronts', 'also', 'show', 'human', 'sides', 'Stephanopoulos', 'openly', 'how', 'nervous', 'Carville', 'cries', 'when', 'staff', 'hard', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'weaknesses', 'presentation', 'first', 'many', 'parts', 'will', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'already', 'know', 'great', 'deal', 'events', 'example', 'mention', 'relationship', 'Carville', 'Mary', 'Matalin', 'never', 'truly', 'explained', 'incongruity', 'political', 'strategists', 'Democrat', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Republican', 'George', 'Bush', 'having', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'middle', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'not', 'emphasized', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'were', 'not', 'aware', 'depth', 'relationship', 'who', 'are', 'then', 'segment', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'flyby.The', 'second', 'main', 'weakness', 'perspective', 'never', 'level', 'fly', 'wall', 'times', 'clear', 'are', 'seeing', 'campaign', 'only', 'extent', 'want', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'least', 'sometimes', 'made', 'appear', 'were', 'seeing', 'workings', 'campaign', 'staff', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'especially', 'disappointed', 'response', 'Gennifer', 'Flowers', 'incident', 'Clinton', 'campaign', 'staff', 'handled', 'very', 'deftly', 'yet', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'did', 'incident', 'later', 'campaign', 'when', 'Stephanopoulos', 'call', 'someone', 'who', 'threatening', 'expose', 'what', 'claim', 'Clinton', 'infidelity', 'case', 'supposedly', 'fathered', 'child', 'black', 'woman', 'Stephanopoulos', 'person', 'politely', 'firmly', '*', 'point', 'one', 'cares', '*', 'break', 'story', 'will', 'never', 'work', 'Democratic', 'party', 'again.I', 'found', 'video', 'fascinating', 'remembered', 'understood', 'events', 'unfolded', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'fundamentals', 'what', 'happening', 'then', 'will', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'puzzled', 'what', 'see']",N/A

Mostly, I was just plain bored.  There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks.  Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President.  And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie.

There's no question that their campaign was a real game changer and one can see Obama applying many of the same tactics as Clinton employed with equally favorable results. What James Carville and George Stephanopoulos did worked: Clinton was elected President of the United States. Carville went on to appear in minor roles in a few movies and also starred in a short-lived HBO T.V. series directed by Steven Soderbergh and produced by George Clooney. Stephanopoulos parlayed his success into high profile hosting gigs on several T.V. news shows.The first disc includes the ""William J. Clinton Foundation Panel,"" which consists of excerpts from a panel discussion held in 2011 to mark the 20th anniversary of Clinton's announcement to run for president. Carville and others recount their experiences and remember how exhausting it was because of the unrelenting pace. Clinton himself shows up and offers his recollections.The second disc starts off with Return of The War Room, the 2008 follow-up documentary that sees Hegedus and Pennebaker check in with some of the major players from their previous film. They reflect on the '92 campaign and its legacy. Carville speaks of the vibe of the campaign team headquarters while others talk about how Democrats were ready to fight back. Many of the participants put certain incidents in the film in context and offer their opinion of it.""Making The War Room"" features the filmmakers and key crew members sharing their experiences of making the famous documentary. Hegedus talks about its origins, including how he got Pennebaker involved. The veteran filmmaker had always wanted to make a documentary about a man becoming president but never had access until he met Hegedus. Originally, they wanted to cover the Republicans, Ross Perot and the Democrats but they were turned down by the first two.Pollster Stanley Greenberg talks about the misunderstood art of polling - what it is and how it's done.

Pennebaker's name is legendary.For music, Pennebaker's work on the 1967 Bob Dylan's documentary ""Dont Look Back"" became a landmark in film and rock history and is regarded as one of the best documentaries of all time.Pennebaker is also know for his music documentary work fon ""Monterey Pop"" (1967), ""Alice Cooper"" (1970), ""Jimi Plays Monterey"" (1986), ""101' (1989) to name a few.But as Pennebaker is known for his music documentaries, he's also known for his political documentaries.  Pennebaker was the editor for the 1960 documentary ""Primary"" featuring John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey for the United States Democratic Party nomination for the President of the United States.He and filmmaker Chris Hegedus (""Startup.com"", ""Down from the Mountain"", ""Jimi Plays Monterey"") would repeat the success of ""Primary"" by creating a documentary in 1993 titled ""The War Room"" about Bill Clinton's campaign for President of the United States during the 1992 presidential election.While the film has been released on DVD in 1998 and in 2004, ""The War Room"" receives its Criterion Collection treatment in 2012 by a Blu-ray and DVD release which includes the 1993 film but also the inclusion of the 2008 documentary ""Return of the War Room"" revisiting many of the people that were featured in the 1993 documentary plus many special features including a panel hosted by the William J. Clinton Foundation, interview with strategist Stanley Greenberg on the evolution of polling plus a featurette with the filmmakers as they discuss the challenges of filming ""The War Room"".The film marks the third Criterion Collection release featuring D. A. Pennebaker (""Monterey Pop"", ""Jimi Plays Monterey & Shake! Otis at Monterey"") and the second for Chris Hegedus (""Jimi Plays Monterey & Shake! Otis at Monterey"").  The Blu-ray and DVD will be released in March 2012.""The War Room"" is a documentary that takes place during Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's presidential campaign.While the coverage of Bill Clinton was limited by the Bill Clinton campaign, both Hegedus and Pennebaker were able to film Communications Director George Stephanopoulos and Lead Strategist James Carville.And what was supposed to be the film crew focusing on the Clinton campaign in New Hampshire for the state's Democratic primary, became much bigger as the film crew was able to document the Primary but also the strategy that took place at the Clinton Campaign Headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas and how the campaign team were able to revitalize Bill Clinton's campaign despite the challenges by Paul Tsongas, the Gennifer Flowers scandal, the Bush campaign (especially since James Carville's girlfriend, Mary Matalin was Bush's deputy campaign manager) and also Ross Perot's campaign.""The War Room"" gives perfect insight to the mindset of the campaign that would lead to Bill Clinton's presidential victory in 1992.Also included on this Criterion Collection Blu-ray release is the 2008 follow-up titled ""Return of the War Room"" which revisits everyone who had worked with Bill Clinton during the campaign, including those who worked with on George Bush and Ross Perot's campaign.  From their memories of the campaign, their feelings of the Monica Lewinsky incident, James Carvile and Mary Matalin's relationship then and now, how the Internet has changed the campaign scene now compared to how things were done back in 1993 and more!VIDEO:""The War Room"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio).  It's important to remind everyone that this is a documentary that utilizes archived footage and footage that came from different sources.  Also, the film was shot with a limited budget.  With that being said, this is the best looking version of ""The War Room"" yet.  In HD, the colors look much natural, not faded nor does it look aged. In fact, I didn't notice any dirt or debris, any major problems with the footage, the film look absolutely clean.Although, ""Return of the War Room"" is a bit different in the fact that video from the ""War Room"" does feature a few specks, but it's important to note that ""Return of the War Room"" is not treated as a double feature but more like a special feature.According to the Criterion Collection, the film was approved by filmmakers Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker and produced by Frazer Pennebaker.  This new HD digital transfer was created on a Spirit 2K Datacine from the original 16 mm camera negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for grain, noise reduction, jitter and flicker.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The War Room"" is presented in 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround. The dialogue is crystal clear and I heard no hissing, crackles or any audio problems during my viewing.According to the Criterion Collection, the soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35 mm magnetic audio tracks.

No new taxes!"", it was a broken promise that was reverberated over and over in the media and television commercials.  There was no doubt that this would provide Democrats fodder for the November election.And for those who followed the election, it was one of the most intriguing political confrontations ever seen in American history.  A campaign in which the Republicans and the Democrats have flipped and flopped in various polls, a campaign that had its share of intriguing circumstances and yet, no matter how much mudslinging there was against Governor Arkansas Bill Clinton, he was the underdog early in the campaign that would later emerge victorious in the 1992 President Election.Many have wondered how his campaign staff pulled it off.  People got to see how it was done courtesy of the documentary ""The War Room"" by Chris Hegedus and legendary documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker.And if there is one thing that I fans of Pennebaker can depend on, it's that D.A. Penneger has a wonderful eye when it comes to creating documentaries and he knows how to make an impact with the public.  He has done it many times in his career and the list of impressive documentaries within his oeuvre is amazing.Having watched ""The War Room"" many years ago and watching it again today, it still surprises me how they managed to pull it off.  To get so much access within the campaign staff and earn their trust to film them in their most challenging of moments.  There was no doubt that both Pennebaker and filmmaker Chris Hegedus really took a risk by covering a campaign for then Arkansas governor Bill Clinton.Why a risk?  There were other Democratic nominees that were doing well in the polls and for Bill Clinton, he was a man that was scrutinized.  When model and actress Gennifer Flowers came out in the media and alleged that she and Bill Clinton had a sexual relationship, for most people, that would doom one's campaign.  He took another blow when it was leaked that he protested against the Vietnam War in Oxford and also used the influence of a U.S. Senator, which he was employed as an aide, to avoid being drafted.  Once again, there were mounting points of negativity surrounding Bill Clinton but yet he never wavered and his staff and American people supported him.Rarely do you see this synergy continue with a political candidate that has been knocked down so many times, but he and his staff came out swinging and Pennebaker and Hegedus captured it all on camera.Similar to what Pennebaker was involved in back in the '60s with John F. Kennedy as an editor on ""Primary"", he and Chris Hegedus was able to capture the campaign of Bill Clinton on camera.Because the Bush camp was unwilling to let any film crew document them on camera and Ross Perot had not officially announced that he would be running, the only person that would be willing to allow coverage was the Clinton campaign.  While coverage of Bill Clinton would be limited, Hegedus and Pennebaker and a few others in the film crew were given the greenlight to film the campaign, especially of lead strategist James Carville and campaign communications director George Stephanopoulos.And for the filmmakers, this documentary would show viewers the behind-the-scenes of an actual presidential campaign, the strategy involved, the respond of campaign members to their opponents tactics plus the wide range of emotions that were involved in the campaign.But for many people who do follow campaigns and who have watched this film, what Carville, Stephanopoulos and the staff were able to accomplish, was like the underdogs beating the favorite team and winning a championship.  With political campaigns, we only see so much through the media but ""The War Room"" was able to show how the campaign took advantage of President's Bush's ""No New Taxes"" broken promise, how they were able to use television as a way to make Clinton this charismatic leader, while George Bush was looking at his watch.  The campaign was thorough with their research, thorough in trying to make a negative into a positive but most of all, to bring Bill Clinton to the people and let them see how he is and that he generally cares about them.It's important to note that as much as the staff were important in making things happen for Bill Clinton, we also get to learn more through the follow-up film ""Return to the War Room"" and learn how Bill Clinton during the campaign was a big inspiration to the group.  From him showing his leadership and never wavering.  No matter how bad things looked, he persevered and wanted to take it directly to the people and see how he's the real deal.  This was a problem with the Bush campaign and as Mary Matalin explained in the follow-up film, he was a surprise to the Republican campaign.So, while ""The War Room"" shows the viewers how things were behind-the-scenes and almost like a chess game, it was a battle of opposing strategy and taking advantages of opportunities, the follow-up was just as entertaining because we got to learn more about the couple who were working on opposing sides (James Carville working for Clinton, Mary Matalin working for Bush) and learning how they dealt with each other during the campaign and the feelings they had towards one another.  We also learn about the dirty work of politics, how one reacted after the Impeachment trial, how some felt about the overall campaign and how campaigns have changed since Barack Obama won the Presidency and the use of social media.""The War Room"" is a magnificent release from the Criterion Collection and I as continue to wish for more Pennebaker documentaries to be released on Blu-ray and DVD, I'm quite pleased of how much better of a release this one was compared to the 1999 and 2004 DVD release, not just in picture and audio quality but the amount of special features included.  The fact that the follow-up film ""Return to the War Room"" was included was a big plus for me but the conversation featurette between Hegedus, Pennebaker, Cutler and Ettinger was also a pleasant addition.  And you also get a few more special features included with this release.Overall, ""The War Room"" is a wonderful Blu-ray release from the Criterion Collection.  I have always been intrigued by this film for its political strategy but also as an educational film for me while I was growing up.  During that time, I was also studying the campaign and although I was a young adult that was not an erudite when it came to politics, the film was inspirational to the point that I wanted to work on a political campaign, be part of the staff in planning strategies and just working in politics.  What I saw on the film, those were the people I wanted to be surrounded with at the time.  Political strategists, people who wanted to make a big difference by getting their candidate elected.""The War Room"" was an intriguing film that it was one of the factors that led me to work as an intern for a California Senator a few months after the release of the film.  After my internship, I was recruited as a paid staff member for a Congressional and Lt. Governor campaign and it was an intriguing, learning experience.Overall, ""The War Room"" is a wonderful political documentary and while I can say it's easy to recommend to those who are interested in politics and have an interested in political campaigns, just the mention of politics may turn people off and if that is the case, then this film may not be for you.  It's a film documenting Bill Clinton's campaign and the strategy and planning that went on behind the scenes.  It's not for everyone, but for those who are interested in political campaigns and are wondering how this presidential campaign overcame major obstacles and eventually making Bill Clinton the 42nd President of the United States, then you will find this film captivating, entertaining and worth owning.""The War Room"" is definitely recommended!",5,"(4.5 stars) ""The War Room"" is captivating,

Four years later, in 1992, the top brass of Bill Clinton's campaign decided that they needed a rapid response team and a War Room to coordinate their strategy and message.  This documentary recalls that effort.""The War Room"" contains fascinating behind-the-scenes footage of the campaign's early stages in the New Hampshire primary, when many thought that the Gennifer Flowers and ROTC draft letter issues would drive Clinton from the race.  The self-proclaimed Comeback Kid survived the Granite State's primary and went on to win the nomination.The film continues on through the Democratic convention that year in New York City and into the fall campaign and the debates, when strategists James Carville and George Stephanopoulos ran the War Room and gained national renown in the process.  Many forget that Bush pulled to within 41-40 in a CNN poll less than a week before the election, and this superb documentary closes by recalling both how nervous the Clinton campaign was in the final days and the relief and celebration of its staffers when their candidate did hold on to win.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[3, 4]","WHAT IS THE WAR ROOM?What we have here is a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes activities of the Clinton for President election team effort during the 1992 presidential race, centering around ""The War Room"" [the campaign headquarters]. This documentary begins at the New Hampshire primary and ends with Clinton's victory.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?We are shown the difficulties the Clinton campaign had in dealing with an avalanche of negative press. How they essentially continued effectively implementing their strategic election plan while simultaneously minimizing the damage to Clinton's credibility caused by his emerging image as a draft-dodger and an adulterer is simply amazing to see.This small epic is quite interesting but knowing how it all ends takes away some of the much deserved suspense and awe. Sure there are scandals for Mr. Clinton and we have the accuser admitting that it was the Republican party that put her up to it. We also have a candidate in Clinton that seemed to have no chance to get the support of his party, let alone win the election. Maybe when the film came out 11 years ago it had more weight. After all this was all one great big surprise and these were current events. However, today my attention went to James Carville who seemed the most genuine and able participant within the war room. We also got a good look at George Stephanopoulos whose presence gave a nice contrast to Carville. I found myself wishing that Carville and Stephanopoulos had been the candidates as they both seemed more sincere and public service oriented than the actual candidates. Naturally it does not work that way, but that is how the film affected me 5 years after the end of the Clinton presidency.HISTORY AS IT HAPPENED!This is a true documentary and appears to be fairly objective in depicting how the people who made up the winning political machine in 1992 functioned. This team functioned quite well in overcoming seemingly impossible hurdles which we can now witness as they were happening. In effect, we get to see a rather significant slice of political history as it happened.SOME FINAL THOUGHTS:This delightful film is not like ""JFK"" or some of Michael Moore's films in that it is not fictionalized to entertain and convince at the expense of truth. Charismatic Hollywood actors are never used in place of the real people to foster credibility and empathy. Simply stated, ""The War Room"" is closer to reality than many of us are use to seeing in film. While it does not have the polish of a ""JFK"" or the raw emotional impact of a ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", ""The War Room"" is much closer to objective truth and therefore extremely worthwhile.",5,11 YEARS LATER ALL THIS SEEMS LIKE A VIDEO OF AN OLD SUPERBOWL - - - - BUT !!!,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,2656,"['WHAT', 'THE', 'WAR', 'ROOM', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'glimpse', 'behind-the-scenes', 'activities', 'Clinton', 'President', 'election', 'team', 'effort', '1992', 'presidential', 'race', 'centering', 'War', 'Room', 'campaign', 'headquarters', ']', 'documentary', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'primary', 'Clinton', 'victory.WHAT', 'IT', 'ALL', 'ABOUT', 'are', 'shown', 'difficulties', 'Clinton', 'campaign', 'had', 'dealing', 'avalanche', 'negative', 'press', 'How', 'essentially', 'continued', 'effectively', 'implementing', 'strategic', 'election', 'plan', 'simultaneously', 'minimizing', 'damage', 'Clinton', 'credibility', 'caused', 'emerging', 'image', 'draft-dodger', 'adulterer', 'simply', 'amazing', 'see.This', 'small', 'epic', 'quite', 'interesting', 'knowing', 'how', 'away', 'much', 'deserved', 'suspense', 'awe', 'Sure', 'are', 'scandals', 'Mr.', 'Clinton', 'have', 'accuser', 'admitting', 'was', 'Republican', 'party', 'put', 'up', 'also', 'have', 'candidate', 'Clinton', 'seemed', 'have', 'chance', 'get', 'support', 'party', 'let', 'alone', 'win', 'election', 'Maybe', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', '11', 'years', 'had', 'more', 'weight', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'big', 'surprise', 'were', 'current', 'events', 'However', 'today', 'attention', 'went', 'James', 'Carville', 'who', 'seemed', 'most', 'genuine', 'able', 'participant', 'war', 'room', 'also', 'got', 'good', 'look', 'George', 'Stephanopoulos', 'presence', 'gave', 'nice', 'contrast', 'Carville', 'found', 'wishing', 'Carville', 'Stephanopoulos', 'had', 'been', 'candidates', 'seemed', 'more', 'sincere', 'public', 'service', 'oriented', 'actual', 'candidates', 'Naturally', 'not', 'work', 'way', 'how', 'film', 'affected', '5', 'years', 'end', 'Clinton', 'presidency.HISTORY', 'IT', 'HAPPENED', 'true', 'documentary', 'be', 'fairly', 'objective', 'depicting', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'up', 'winning', 'political', 'machine', '1992', 'functioned', 'team', 'functioned', 'quite', 'well', 'overcoming', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'hurdles', 'can', 'now', 'witness', 'were', 'happening', 'effect', 'get', 'see', 'rather', 'significant', 'slice', 'political', 'history', 'FINAL', 'THOUGHTS', 'delightful', 'film', 'not', 'JFK', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'films', 'not', 'fictionalized', 'entertain', 'convince', 'expense', 'truth', 'Charismatic', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'are', 'never', 'used', 'place', 'real', 'people', 'foster', 'credibility', 'empathy', 'Simply', 'stated', 'War', 'Room', 'closer', 'reality', 'many', 'are', 'use', 'seeing', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'polish', 'JFK', 'raw', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'War', 'Room', 'much', 'closer', 'objective', 'truth', 'therefore', 'extremely', 'worthwhile']",N/A

The documentary was originally supposed to be about the romance between chief Clinton strategist, James ( the ""Ragin' Cajun"") Carville, and Marlee Matilin, who, at the time, was a chief advisor to the George Bush campaign. But documentaries, like politics, have a way of taking on a life of their own, and The War Room turned into a cinema verit&eacute; examination of a presidential election at work, through the eyes of the master, Carville, and George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's press secretary, with whom the audience identifies, idealist that he is.The War Room gives one an opportunity to see up close the salesmanship, competitiveness, sincerity, frustration, and the unrelenting pace of king-making in politics. Carville and Stephanopoulos' work is exhilarating and exhausting. They are men of conviction, and have the battle-scars to prove it. As we watch the Convention showmanship, the strategies, the debates, and the cabin-fever come election day, we find ourselves knuckling down with our two guides and crossing our fingers as the results come in.Hegedus and Pennebaker do a remarkable job of making the audience feel part and parcel of the Clinton campaign. Even more impressive, election strategy successes and failures come across as well. We see the Clinton strategists impressive &quot;quick-response&quot; system in action, as they do battle with the media over the Gennifer Flowers nightmare, and we see what at first seems to be a promising lead on the Bush campaign financing their sign-printing with foreign laborers fall off the nightlynews schedule.Nobility and venality can coexist in the most talented and altruistic of people, but cannot be painlessly reconciled in the eyes of those who follow and admire them. This is a lesson lightly touched on by The War Room, and beaten over our heads by eight years that followed.The War Room was an Academy Award nominee in the category of &quot;Best Documentary.&quot;",5,Excellent Documentary on Electoral Politics,1017360000,"03 29, 2002",2002,2083,"['One', 'time', 'favorite', 'documentaries', 'War', 'Room', 'scene', 'machinations', 'Bill', 'Clinton', '1992', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'documentary', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'romance', 'chief', 'Clinton', 'strategist', 'James', 'Ragin', 'Cajun', 'Carville', 'Marlee', 'Matilin', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'chief', 'advisor', 'George', 'Bush', 'campaign', 'documentaries', 'politics', 'have', 'way', 'taking', 'life', 'own', 'War', 'Room', 'turned', 'cinema', 'verit', 'eacute', 'examination', 'presidential', 'election', 'work', 'eyes', 'master', 'Carville', 'George', 'Stephanopoulos', 'Clinton', 'press', 'secretary', 'whom', 'audience', 'identifies', 'idealist', 'War', 'Room', 'one', 'opportunity', 'see', 'up', 'close', 'salesmanship', 'competitiveness', 'sincerity', 'frustration', 'unrelenting', 'pace', 'king-making', 'politics', 'Carville', 'Stephanopoulos', 'work', 'exhilarating', 'exhausting', 'are', 'men', 'conviction', 'have', 'battle-scars', 'prove', 'watch', 'Convention', 'showmanship', 'strategies', 'debates', 'cabin-fever', 'come', 'election', 'day', 'find', 'knuckling', 'down', 'two', 'guides', 'crossing', 'fingers', 'results', 'come', 'in.Hegedus', 'Pennebaker', 'do', 'remarkable', 'job', 'making', 'audience', 'feel', 'part', 'parcel', 'Clinton', 'campaign', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'election', 'strategy', 'successes', 'failures', 'come', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'Clinton', 'strategists', 'impressive', 'quot', 'quick-response', 'quot', 'system', 'action', 'do', 'battle', 'media', 'Gennifer', 'Flowers', 'nightmare', 'see', 'what', 'first', 'be', 'promising', 'lead', 'Bush', 'campaign', 'financing', 'sign-printing', 'foreign', 'laborers', 'fall', 'nightlynews', 'schedule.Nobility', 'venality', 'can', 'coexist', 'most', 'talented', 'altruistic', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'painlessly', 'reconciled', 'eyes', 'who', 'follow', 'admire', 'lesson', 'lightly', 'touched', 'War', 'Room', 'beaten', 'heads', 'eight', 'years', 'followed.The', 'War', 'Room', 'was', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominee', 'category', 'quot', 'Best', 'Documentary.', 'quot']",N/A

Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus spent three weeks shot 33 hours of film, which was later combined with news footage to capture the cause-and-effect relationship between what happened inside &quot;The War Room&quot; and the election of the president.  There is no voice over narration to this documentary, just clips spliced together.  The dynamic behind it all is the Fire and Ice duo of chief Clinton strategist James Carville and director of communications George Stephanopoulos. Of course, both titles are gross simplifications of their roles in the campaign, and it is impossible not to see &quot;The War Room&quot; as being one of the inspirations for &quot;The West Wing.&quot;What stands out in watching this documentary is the complete sense that this is what it was really like, which, in the end, is more impressive than the fact that these guys won the election. Here you get to see the infamous Clinton &quot;quick response&quot; strategy at work, where every attack by the opponent is crushed in an immediate barrage of rhetoric. For me the most memorable sequences were when the Clinton brain trust discover the Bush-Quayle campaign is having its campaign signs printed in Brazil rather than in the U.S., Carville becomes emotional in the final staff meeting of the Clinton War Room, and when he and Stephanopoulos find themselves unsure as to how they are supposed to address the man who is now the president-elect.From the perspective of today it is interesting to compare the Carville and Stephanopoulos we see behind closed doors with their more public personas as talking heads. The Jim and Mary (Matlin) traveling road show that keeps Carville in the political spotlight today might get more of the publicity, but the one who has impressed me the most is Stephanopoulos, whose work on the Sunday morning political roundtable &quot;This Week&quot; established his reputation as one of the most objective and restrained political analysts on the tube of either party affiliation.  That assessment was codified this past year when Stephanopoulos replaced Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts as the hosts of the show.  &quot;The War Room&quot; shows not only where he paid his dues, but gives him his bone fides as well.The final irony is that the one clip showing Al Gore giving a campaign speech is more dynamic than anything we saw during the 2000 election.",5,Carville &amp; Stephanopoulos run the Clinton War Room in '92,1062028800,"08 28, 2003",2003,2498,"['celebrated', 'documentary', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'inner', 'sanctum', 'Bill', 'Clinton', '1992', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'D.A', 'Pennebaker', 'Chris', 'Hegedus', 'spent', 'three', 'weeks', 'shot', '33', 'hours', 'film', 'was', 'later', 'combined', 'news', 'footage', 'capture', 'cause-and-effect', 'relationship', 'what', 'happened', 'inside', 'quot', 'War', 'Room', 'quot', 'election', 'president', 'voice', 'narration', 'documentary', 'just', 'clips', 'spliced', 'together', 'dynamic', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'duo', 'chief', 'Clinton', 'strategist', 'James', 'Carville', 'director', 'communications', 'George', 'Stephanopoulos', 'course', 'titles', 'are', 'gross', 'simplifications', 'roles', 'campaign', 'impossible', 'not', 'see', 'quot', 'War', 'Room', 'quot', 'being', 'one', 'inspirations', 'quot', 'West', 'Wing.', 'quot', 'What', 'out', 'watching', 'documentary', 'complete', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'end', 'more', 'impressive', 'fact', 'guys', 'won', 'election', 'Here', 'get', 'see', 'infamous', 'Clinton', 'quot', 'quick', 'response', 'quot', 'strategy', 'work', 'where', 'attack', 'opponent', 'crushed', 'immediate', 'barrage', 'rhetoric', 'most', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'were', 'when', 'Clinton', 'brain', 'trust', 'discover', 'Bush-Quayle', 'campaign', 'having', 'campaign', 'signs', 'printed', 'Brazil', 'rather', 'U.S.', 'Carville', 'emotional', 'final', 'staff', 'meeting', 'Clinton', 'War', 'Room', 'when', 'Stephanopoulos', 'find', 'unsure', 'how', 'are', 'supposed', 'address', 'man', 'who', 'now', 'president-elect.From', 'perspective', 'today', 'interesting', 'compare', 'Carville', 'Stephanopoulos', 'see', 'closed', 'doors', 'more', 'public', 'personas', 'talking', 'heads', 'Jim', 'Mary', 'Matlin', 'traveling', 'road', 'show', 'Carville', 'political', 'spotlight', 'today', 'might', 'get', 'more', 'publicity', 'one', 'who', 'impressed', 'most', 'Stephanopoulos', 'work', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'political', 'roundtable', 'quot', 'Week', 'quot', 'established', 'reputation', 'one', 'most', 'objective', 'restrained', 'political', 'analysts', 'tube', 'party', 'affiliation', 'assessment', 'was', 'codified', 'past', 'year', 'when', 'Stephanopoulos', 'replaced', 'Sam', 'Donaldson', 'Cokie', 'Roberts', 'hosts', 'show', 'quot', 'War', 'Room', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'where', 'paid', 'dues', 'bone', 'fides', 'well.The', 'final', 'irony', 'one', 'clip', 'showing', 'Al', 'Gore', 'giving', 'campaign', 'speech', 'more', 'dynamic', 'anything', 'saw', '2000', 'election']",N/A

Mostly centered around the Clinton campaign, we get a look at a man who is determined to be the next President of the United States.  James Carville and George Stephanopoulos are the main brains behind the campaign, and they show it with their rapid thinking and reactions.  The road to the White House proves to be a bumpy one for Clinton and company, as scandals surface and tabloid articles flood the newsstands.  The people behind the campaign of Bill Clinton never get a break as they always have to be on their toes and figure out damage control.  Even though you know how it all ends, it is still a tense and shocking film.What I love the most about this documentary is that there is no overall narrator, and there really isn't an agenda to it.  The film doesn't force-feed you a likable Clinton.  The film's real purpose is to show you what happens during these campaigns.  Even though it's centered around Clinton, this film really could've been about anyone.  The film doesn't sugarcoat anything as it gives you the raw footage and shows you how both sides can play dirty.  It was amazing to watch Carville and Stephanopoulos work the way they did, as I had no idea how much of an important role they played in Clinton's campaign.I think this documentary can be enjoyed by anyone who is interested in how the system works.  You really don't even have to like Clinton in order to enjoy it, as the film isn't trying to make it look like Clinton is a saint or anything like that.  It is about how dirty people in these campaigns can fight, and it occurs on both sides.  And since there is no overall narrator, there is really nothing in here that tells you that you should feel a certain way about it all.  The DVD contains no special features, which is a shame.I really enjoyed &quot;The War Room,&quot; and I'm not a real big fan of politics.  I think it presents an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes.

Lachance,"[1, 11]","The completely naive idea that this campaign was some kind of new groundbreaking approach to presidential campaigning, or that Carville and Stephanopolis re-wrote the book on such campaigns is sadly nothing more than left wing revisionist thinking being pasted across America's forehead once again.  The fact that a decade earlier Michael Deaver orchestrated an even greater victory against Jimmy Carter and then again against Walter Mondale is the timeless proof that a successful and seemingly steamroller campaign strategy is nothing new to American Politics. Moreover it must be noted that the Carville/Stephanopolis duo were not the do-all/end-all vehicle that handed Mr. and Mrs. Clinton the Presidency. What this colorful documentary fails to note is that it was neither Clinton nor his campaigners that defeated George Bush in 1992.

190303,A3K8OWCZYJBJ1E,1573624578,"M. McM ""AOTT-TMF""","[4, 4]","As of this writing, all 50 reviews for this film cover the older VHS and DVD editions, so I'm going to focus on the Criterion Collection reissue that came out today. First off, this is a welcome reissue because the film's been out-of-print for years. It was becoming difficult to find, let alone purchase, so I'm glad it's widely available now.But even if you have the old DVD copy of this film, it's worth upgrading because the transfer is often stunning. Criterion actually went back to the original 16mm camera negative, and the results are immediately apparent. The amount of detail is striking and the hues and color levels are actually realistic - on older video editions, they looked flat and dull. There are a few scenes that were constructed out of TV footage (mostly the news footage at the beginning of the movie), and though they look fine, you can't expect much out of those scenes - they were shot on videotape that's never going to look good blown up in hi-def. However, watching that stuff just makes the 16mm footage that follows it look even better. To Criterion's credit, much of the film grain has been preserved, a big reason why their transfer looks so much more detailed than older video releases. If you've seen Criterion's other releases that were shot in 16mm film (like ""Close-Up"" or ""Harvey Milk""), you'll know what to expect. Few documentaries are shot on 16mm film anymore (a format that's virtually been phased out in the U.S.), and this movie was released at the tail end of that era - the fact that it was shot in 16mm actually adds to the historical value of this movie.The best part of this package is actually the extras, which are very well done. The main one is a follow-up documentary that was shot for the Sundance Channel called ""Return to the War Room."" Unlike ""The War Room,"" it's not cinema verite - it's all talking head interviews - but it does fill in all the background information you need in case you're unfamiliar with American politics (specifically the way campaigns and elections work in the U.S.), and it does a good job of detailing how things have changed since then. They talk extensively with Carville and Stephanopoulos, but they also talk to Mary Matalin (who has a few scenes in ""The War Room"") and a conservative lobbyist who actually learned quite a bit from watching Clinton. And speaking of Bill Clinton, he does appear in another featurette, giving his thoughts on how the ""story"" of his campaign came together. It's worth noting that the featurette was taken from a public discussion broadcast on C-SPAN, so you're basically watching Clinton work a crowd like he was back on the campaign trail (albeit toned down a notch or two).Finally, there are three interviews (or featurettes) that are valuable for anyone who's learning to be a documentary filmmaker. One of them is an extensive roundtable discussion between two of the producers and the two directors, Chris Hegedus and D.A. Pennebaker, and it's very instructive in terms of how the film came together, and how they had to deal with each challenge, the most difficult and recurring one being access. Another interview with producer Frazer Pennebaker also addressed the business side of things, which is particularly interesting because this was an independent production that had no distributor until after it was finished, and the internet certainly wasn't popular or sophisticated enough to be an option. You also realize how a lot of small details become bigger issues with an independent film like this. For example, do they need to license a song just because someone decided to play it at a campaign stop? Finally, there's another interview with cameraman Nick Doob, who shot many of Pennebaker's films, and even though it's short, it's great to hear what's going on in a cameraman's mind during a very tense moment.In 1992, filming a movie about a campaign staff probably seemed relatively safe. But all that's changed, especially now that you can shoot and make a video available almost instantaneously. (It's worth noting that the filmmakers had to promise that no footage would be released until after the election. Given the time it took to process, sync up and edit film, it probably wasn't hard to keep. It would be difficult to trust any filmmaker to honor that agreement today, it's just too easy to break.) Campaigns are so much more mindful of cameras now that making a film like ""The War Room"" may be impossible, and it's wonderful that Criterion has brought this landmark documentary back into print.",5,Finally back in-print in a definitive mastering from the Criterion Collection,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4544,"['writing', '50', 'reviews', 'film', 'older', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'editions', ""'m"", 'going', 'focus', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'reissue', 'came', 'out', 'today', 'First', 'off', 'welcome', 'reissue', 'film', 'been', 'out-of-print', 'years', 'was', 'becoming', 'difficult', 'find', 'let', 'alone', 'purchase', ""'m"", 'glad', 'widely', 'available', 'now.But', 'even', 'have', 'old', 'DVD', 'copy', 'film', 'worth', 'upgrading', 'transfer', 'often', 'stunning', 'Criterion', 'actually', 'went', 'back', 'original', '16mm', 'camera', 'negative', 'results', 'are', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'amount', 'detail', 'striking', 'hues', 'color', 'levels', 'are', 'actually', 'realistic', 'older', 'video', 'editions', 'looked', 'flat', 'dull', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'constructed', 'TV', 'footage', 'mostly', 'news', 'footage', 'beginning', 'movie', 'look', 'fine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'videotape', 'never', 'going', 'look', 'good', 'blown', 'up', 'hi-def', 'However', 'watching', 'stuff', 'just', '16mm', 'footage', 'look', 'even', 'better', 'Criterion', 'credit', 'much', 'film', 'grain', 'been', 'preserved', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'transfer', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'detailed', 'older', 'video', 'releases', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Criterion', 'other', 'releases', 'were', 'shot', '16mm', 'film', 'Close-Up', 'Harvey', 'Milk', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Few', 'documentaries', 'are', 'shot', '16mm', 'film', 'anymore', 'format', 'virtually', 'been', 'phased', 'out', 'U.S.', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'tail', 'end', 'era', 'fact', 'was', 'shot', '16mm', 'actually', 'historical', 'value', 'movie.The', 'best', 'part', 'package', 'actually', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'main', 'one', 'follow-up', 'documentary', 'was', 'shot', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'called', 'Return', 'War', 'Room', 'War', 'Room', 'not', 'cinema', 'verite', 'talking', 'head', 'interviews', 'fill', 'background', 'information', 'need', 'case', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'American', 'politics', 'specifically', 'way', 'campaigns', 'elections', 'work', 'U.S.', 'good', 'job', 'detailing', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'then', 'talk', 'extensively', 'Carville', 'Stephanopoulos', 'also', 'talk', 'Mary', 'Matalin', 'who', 'few', 'scenes', 'War', 'Room', 'conservative', 'lobbyist', 'who', 'actually', 'learned', 'quite', 'bit', 'watching', 'Clinton', 'speaking', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'appear', 'featurette', 'giving', 'thoughts', 'how', 'story', 'campaign', 'came', 'together', 'worth', 'noting', 'featurette', 'was', 'taken', 'public', 'discussion', 'broadcast', 'C-SPAN', ""'re"", 'basically', 'watching', 'Clinton', 'work', 'crowd', 'was', 'back', 'campaign', 'trail', 'toned', 'down', 'notch', 'two', '.Finally', 'are', 'three', 'interviews', 'featurettes', 'are', 'valuable', 'anyone', 'who', 'learning', 'be', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'One', 'extensive', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'two', 'producers', 'two', 'directors', 'Chris', 'Hegedus', 'D.A', 'Pennebaker', 'very', 'instructive', 'terms', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'together', 'how', 'had', 'deal', 'challenge', 'most', 'difficult', 'recurring', 'one', 'being', 'access', 'interview', 'producer', 'Frazer', 'Pennebaker', 'also', 'addressed', 'business', 'side', 'things', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'was', 'independent', 'production', 'had', 'distributor', 'was', 'finished', 'internet', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'popular', 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'be', 'option', 'also', 'realize', 'how', 'lot', 'small', 'details', 'become', 'bigger', 'issues', 'independent', 'film', 'example', 'do', 'need', 'license', 'song', 'just', 'someone', 'decided', 'play', 'campaign', 'stop', 'Finally', 'interview', 'cameraman', 'Nick', 'Doob', 'who', 'shot', 'many', 'Pennebaker', 'films', 'even', 'short', 'great', 'hear', 'what', 'going', 'cameraman', 'mind', 'very', 'tense', 'moment.In', '1992', 'filming', 'movie', 'campaign', 'staff', 'probably', 'seemed', 'relatively', 'safe', 'changed', 'especially', 'now', 'can', 'shoot', 'make', 'video', 'available', 'almost', 'instantaneously', 'worth', 'noting', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'promise', 'footage', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'election', 'Given', 'time', 'took', 'process', 'sync', 'up', 'edit', 'film', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'keep', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'trust', 'filmmaker', 'honor', 'agreement', 'today', 'just', 'too', 'easy', 'break', 'Campaigns', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'mindful', 'cameras', 'now', 'making', 'film', 'War', 'Room', 'may', 'be', 'impossible', 'wonderful', 'Criterion', 'brought', 'landmark', 'documentary', 'back', 'print']",N/A
