Minutella ""mystery buff""","[3, 3]","Like most shows, ""Dynasty""---considered a classic among nighttime soaps---needed a season to get its feet on the ground, and this was it. So yes, you won't get as of yet the Krystle-Alexis catfights, Sammie Jo's and Adam's evil scheming, Diahann Carroll's wonderful Dominique Deveraux, or even Joan Collins in all her splendor...Season One is really a warm up. However, there is some solid entertainment here: good writing, solid performances (especially by Al Corley and the always-lovely Pamela Sue Martin), and some nice attention to detail. As other reviewers have mentioned, enough cannot be said about how great Pamela Sue Martin as Fallon is to the show; sexy, vibrant, sarcastic, and adorable, she adds a real touch of class to the show (something the ""later"" Fallon, Emma Samms, never achieved). Basically Season One is essential viewing for soap fans and especially the Dynasty fans who are anticipating later season releases with all the juicy catfights and the one and only Alexis.",4,Solid Beginning for a Memorable Nighttime Soap,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,993,"['most', 'shows', 'Dynasty', '-considered', 'classic', 'nighttime', 'soaps', '-needed', 'season', 'get', 'feet', 'ground', 'was', 'So', 'yes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'yet', 'Krystle-Alexis', 'catfights', 'Sammie', 'Jo', 'Adam', 'evil', 'scheming', 'Diahann', 'Carroll', 'wonderful', 'Dominique', 'Deveraux', 'even', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'splendor', 'Season', 'One', 'really', 'warm', 'up', 'However', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'here', 'good', 'writing', 'solid', 'performances', 'especially', 'Al', 'Corley', 'always-lovely', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'nice', 'attention', 'detail', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'enough', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'how', 'great', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'Fallon', 'show', 'vibrant', 'sarcastic', 'adorable', 'real', 'touch', 'class', 'show', 'something', 'later', 'Fallon', 'Emma', 'Samms', 'never', 'achieved', 'Basically', 'Season', 'One', 'essential', 'viewing', 'soap', 'fans', 'especially', 'Dynasty', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'anticipating', 'later', 'season', 'releases', 'juicy', 'catfights', 'one', 'only', 'Alexis']",Dynasty: Season 1

The packaging is superior - you can tell Fox didn't just slap this together - it is packaged in beautiful thin cases housed in a very nice cardboard sleeve, WITH an additional sleeve to hold them into place.The episodes themselves look amazing for a show that is now 25 years old.  The color and picture quality is beautiful.  I'm amazed at the great job they did on this set.  A lot of care was taken in producing this set.The story itself is much better than I remember.  I used to think that Dynasty didn't really start till Alexis and Sammy Jo arrived.  But on the contrary, the stories here are compelling and heartwrenching.  The acting is superb, especially by actresses such as Pamela Bellwood, Pamela Sue Martin, and Linda Evans.  These three ladies are beautiful and have a talent that surpasses anyone on TV nowadays.

881076,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B0007IO6V4,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[6, 6]","Are general briefs of the entire season necessary? This show came to be known as a soap, but the first season is more like a drama. Yeah, it's devoid of catfights, of the B-word being tossed around, of Joan Collins (Alexis Morrel Carrington Colby Raun) scheming to get back at Blake for throwing her out of his mansion and lifestyle ... BUT ... this season is great and shows that this was more than just a flash in the pan. The creators of the show, Esther and Richard Shapiro, set out to tell a story of society as it was, and as it still is.Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) is an oil tycoon. He's preparing to marry his former secretary, Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans). She's still in love with Matthew Blaisdale (Bo Hopkins), whom she had an affair with while his wife, Claudia (Bellwood) was in a mental institution. The wedding brings together the family and exposes it's many flaws. Blake's daughter Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) is jelous, wanting her father all to herself. She gets involved with Cecil Colby, who'll help her father out if she marries his nephew, Jeff (John James). Then there's the Carrington rebel son Steven (Al Corley), who's struggling with his sexuality and his place in the world.Everyone can find something to relate to in ""Dynasty."" Whether it's a dysfunctional family, issues of sexuality, or class struggles, there's a lot said in this series that simply caught me by surprise. The actors are all high class. The first season is different from all the other seasons. Yes, it's shorter, with only 13 episodes which clock in at 15 hours worth, but it's high quality story-telling and acting. Forsythe makes you hate Blake for how hard he is on Krystle and how demanding he is of Steven. Steven puts a new face on a bisexual male, one that today's t.v. really wouldn't handle.The first episode was rather epic and was originally shown on ABC as a 3-hour event. As for the transfer to DVD, I thought it was rather good. I've heard complaints, but considering it was filmed in 1981, I think it's good. The story lines and acting are nothing like the rest of the series. Linda Evans plays a Krystle who isn't comfortable with wealth and she isn't comfortable with being Blake's lap-dog. Forsythe's Blake is hard-nosed and aged, hateful and angry and unable to manage his family while his business ventures take-off. Another breakout star is Bellwood, who plays a fragile Claudia Blaisdale. Her scenes with her on-screen daughter and others really help you to relate the all the wealth and glamour. Another great actor, Pamela Sue Martin, who plays the jealous daughter. She's witty, independent, and knows how to get to people.I'd definately recommend that people listen to the commentary. I was disapointed with some of the commentary that went into the Dallas Season 1 and 2 set. Yet, Esther Shapiro really puts in a great effort by explaining everything in the three episodes which commentary is available. She'll explain the coming of Joan Collins, why they decided to spend so much time on Steven's sexuality, why this season was different from all the others. She puts the show in the context of the '80s, saying that they wanted to do a show about the wealthy but they wanted to tell it somewhat from the perspective of the ordinary man. Surprisingly, she also compares a lot of the scenes and characters to that of Dallas, which Dynasty was in constant competition with.As for other bonus features, Al Corley (Steven), does commentary with Esther Shapiro for two episodes near the end of the season. He too is great to listen to. They don't just sit there and say, ""oh, look, there I am. I remember liking that scene."" He comments on how he was frustrated with Steven always being unsure of his sexuality, on the secrets behind little scenes such as the big trial, on what it was like behind the stage. ""Family, Furs and Fun: Creating DYNASTY"" isn't really a series overview as the box claims. It talks about the creation of the series and the characters. It's short but informative. Richard Shapiro speaks more here than his wife Esther. Fallon and Steven are profiled in ""Dynasty's Daughter"" and ""Prodigal Son."" I would ave liked it if it would have gotten the opinions of the actors who took over the roles in the later seasons, just to get an idea of how these characters changed. BUT, the great thing is that these segements contained candid interviews from Pamela Sue Martin and Al Corley as they are today. So they've had time to reflect on their experiences and their roles and they don't really hold back. Both are about five minutes each. Pamela Sue Martin goes into Fallon's character and the decision she made to leave the show.This was such a great season and show that I'd recommend it to all. It's relevant to today because here we are, nearly two decades after the show first aired, still dealing with homosexuality, oil, wealth, greed, just as the characters in the show are. Birth control, drugs, sex ... that's all a part of this season as well and highly interesting. ""Dynasty"" is a timeless show that perhaps was derailed after Joan Collins stepped in and spiced things up, but definately should be included in your DVD collection.",5,Still Timeless and

881078,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,B0007IO6V4,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[1, 15]","One couldn't wait for the 70s to end, what with years of television that gave us Fantasy Island, Love Boat, Happy Days, Maude, etc... Bad shows that spun off more bad shows full of schlock and contrived, over the top acting. And what came to our rescue? Dynasty, Dallas, and their spin-offs, schlock, and perhaps the worst (yet rewarded with Emmys) acting perhaps in the history of television. For that alone, I'd recommend buying ""Dynasty"", if only because it could be put in a time capsule for future generations to laugh at what fascinated TV viewers so much in the 80s. As if bad music wasn't enough to be ashamed of in that decade, we were given soap operas in TV's prime time slots, and the acting that has come to be expected in such programs. The fact that anyone was even nominated for acting in a show as dreadful as this is an indictment on awards shows themselves. Fact is, this was a show that got what it asked for- lots of females talking about it the next day at work as if they were talking about real people in their lives, their fashions, their affairs, their wretched lifestyles that were justified by the flaunting of their wealth, the pretty faces (men and women) and the fantasies and affairs to go with them. And yes, we got more spin-offs. Dynasty had some of the most contrived, predictable, cliched writing, and some of the worst acting in TV history. Linda Evans should have been banned from the screen actors guild. Mr. Forsythe himself was better off at being just a voice on a TV show. Bo Hopkins disgraces himself and his history of some great character acting roles in some great movies (""Wild Bunch/ Culpepper Cattle Company"") by being associated with this drek, and for laughing all the way to the bank by merely doing a hybrid impersonation of James Dean and Marlon Brando. And Pamela Sue Martin, if it wasn't for her sex appeal and fashion statements (as can be said for most of the cast), she'd never have acted after ""The Poseidon Adventure."" But I suppose she too epitomizes the show in one respect. There was at least one character that would draw a target audience the producers wanted to reach- in my case I lusted for Martin. That made me a viewer for several epiodes a year, enough to give an informed, objective opinion on this show- garbage! Only those who cling to the past would cling to this show. For them, this show is a bargain. To be fair, it is luscious in it's digital remastering, and all the glitz, glamour and fashion comes across in it better than when originally aired. But also coming across as clearly is the pretentious personna, the incredibly simplified story lines of a complicated business world, and what in hindsight even some of the most dedicated fans has to admit is some dreadful fashions, which was one of the shows drawing cards. The only people who will buy this DVD set is those who watched this show in the first place. No viewer with a taste for quality television will watch this without laughing at it. It's no coincidence that the mid to late 70s, to the mid to late 80s was the time period I watched the least amount of TV in my entire life- news, sports and real events aside (not to be confused with ""reality TV""). At least the 70s had some ground breaking programming to help offset the [...]. What helped salvage the 80s? The Cosby Show? That's another argument for another day. In general, there's a reason the networks are losing so many viewers to cable and sattelite TV: Quality television has been on a downward spiral since the mid-70s and has only devolved at an exponential rate.

881079,A2E5XLTZZZ23HQ,B0007IO6V4,BENJAMIN YAFET,"[1, 1]","This product seems to be made in Germany. My first problem with that is that DVD's are two sided. But more importantly than that, Episodes are missing and are even badly counted. For example, in Disc four (4) Episodes 11-13, Episode 12 is missing. And so on and so fourth. Between Disc one (1) and (2), the outside labeling of Episodes is wrong, i.e. Episodes are missing.

King Lear with Oil, instead of land. The land of the Rich, Famous and otherwise. It was Upstair Downstairs for American TV and most of all in the 1980's , it was one of the best!John Forsyth brought an air of class to the role of Blake Carrington, playing against his so clear, nice guy type image he had played for 30 years since Batchlor Father. Linda Evans was brought out of moth balls to play Krystal, to see this world thru her eyes was eye openning. You must remember first season did not have the talent of Joan Collins (she came to the cast in season two).Esther and Richard Shapiro created a King Lear for modern TV. A strong father and his two wayward kids. the tart daughter Falon, played to the hilt by Pamela Sue Martin (i wish she would do TV again)and  Steven  the openly Gay son who needs his father's approval when all he gets is belittlement.

I've been having fun watching these episodes again, especially since in childhood, I had the B&W; tv and can now enjoy the episodes again and in color.  The acting was good, the scripts were well written for prime time soap material, and some of the aerial shots of the forests and such were breathtaking.My only complaint is for such a show where true fans loved seeing how the characters dressed as much as what was going on and such, the packaging was very limited in its presentation.  It seems nowdays, the cheaper way to package is to sandwich episodes on either side of a disc.  Sure, it's more convenient, doesn't take as much time to sort through episodes and putting in discs, but the black interior casings, disc cover repeats of what's on the front cover, and small pics lining the back of the casings just doesn't do the show justice.I'm hoping as given the long time frame between Dallas seasons 1-2 & 3, that we won't have to wait long for Season 2 of Dynasty and when it does come out, atleast add some more pictures and make the packaging a bit more enticing!Aside from that, I'm another Dynasty fan sooo glad it's now out on DVD!",4,"Finally on DVD, but dissapointing packaging",1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,1305,"['have', 'been', 'checking', 'repeatedly', 'release', 'tv', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', '80', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'release', ""'ve"", 'been', 'having', 'fun', 'watching', 'episodes', 'again', 'especially', 'childhood', 'had', 'B', 'W', 'tv', 'can', 'now', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'again', 'color', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'scripts', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'prime', 'time', 'soap', 'material', 'aerial', 'shots', 'forests', 'such', 'were', 'breathtaking.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'such', 'show', 'where', 'true', 'fans', 'loved', 'seeing', 'how', 'characters', 'dressed', 'as', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'such', 'packaging', 'was', 'very', 'limited', 'presentation', 'nowdays', 'cheaper', 'way', 'package', 'sandwich', 'episodes', 'side', 'disc', 'Sure', 'more', 'convenient', ""n't"", 'take', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'sort', 'episodes', 'putting', 'discs', 'black', 'interior', 'casings', 'disc', 'cover', 'repeats', 'what', 'front', 'cover', 'small', 'pics', 'lining', 'back', 'casings', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'show', 'justice.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'given', 'long', 'time', 'frame', 'Dallas', 'seasons', '1-2', '3', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'long', 'Season', '2', 'Dynasty', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'atleast', 'add', 'more', 'pictures', 'make', 'packaging', 'bit', 'more', 'enticing', 'Aside', ""'m"", 'Dynasty', 'fan', 'sooo', 'glad', 'now', 'out', 'DVD']",Dynasty: Season 1

881083,A2VMHFDH5V1BOC,B0007IO6V4,Bragan Thomas,"[6, 7]","As quite a few reviewers have commented, this DVD set does not include any episodes with Joan Collins, whose casting as the marvellously bitchy Alexis Morell Carrington proved to be the match which lit the flame of this show's popularity.  Most people remember ""Dynasty"" as a good bit of campy, silly, glossy fun - who could forget the huge shoulder pads, the garish sets, or all of those catfights between Alexis and Krystle!  Certainly, revisiting Season One of this beloved program gives you the feeling of watching something which just isn't quite ""right"" - Collins' arrival proved to be the glue which knit the cast and crew together and made ""Dynasty"" a must-see show.  That said, there are many Dynasty fans who actually prefer the first - Alexis-free - season.  Why?  Possibly because Collins' campy presence and over-the-top performance style quickly took the show in a very different, and for many, far less satisfying direction.  Originally, ""Dynasty"" was meant to be a far more realistic and topical program than it eventually became - a show which, unlike its competitor ""Dallas,"" tried to explore very serious issues beneath its glossy melodramatic surface.  Thus, the first season (which was a ratings success but far from the colossal hit the show became in the Alexis years) stands for many as a catalogue of ""might-have-beens.""  For one thing the absence of a strong antagonist/villain at this time made the whole show much more complicated and ambiguous.  Blake Carrington, for example, is in this early period a far from sympathetic man.  John Forsythe plays Blake as ruthless, selfish, arrogant and domineering.  An especially manipulative CEO, Blake treats all others as if they were pawns on a chessboard.  Blake at this period is not the cardboard patriarch he would later become.  In this season, Blake shows little restraint when things do not go his way, and not only winds up killing his son's male lover at the end, but also orders the brutal beating of his daughter's boyfriend and even rapes his own wife in a night of drunken frenzy.  Throughout the season, Blake seems to regard Krystle as his personal possession - a true trophy wife.  He treats his new wife as he treats his children, and it is in fact the conflict between Blake and his offspring which is the heart of this version of the show.  At this period, son Steven (Al Corley) and daughter Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin - the ONLY Fallon) each have major trouble dealing with their father, but for different reasons.  If the producers had had the guts to logically expand on the plotlines they developed in this season, Dynasty would have been a quite different show.  Indeed, the changes made in the characters of Fallon and Steven proved to be so disturbing to the actors playing those parts that both of them eventually left, changing the chemistry of the program and making both characters much less interesting.  In this season, Pamela Sue Martin makes an indelible impression as Fallon Carrington.  Brilliant, spoiled, sensual, free-spirited and tomboyish, Martin gives us a Fallon whose flirtations mannerisms and [...]behavior never compromise her status as a lady.  Fallon - whose business acumen makes her Blake's chosen heir - is also the only person unafraid to tell Blake to go to hell, just as she is his only vulnerable spot.  After Alexis reappeared, the ""bitchy"" qualities displayed by Fallon in the first season were downplayed, making the girl a much more conventional and less independent character, which caused Martin to leave the show suddenly after the second season.  Al Corley - whose brilliant performance as the deeply conflicted yet heroic Steven is the real revelation of this DVD - had the same experience.  Corley accepted the role of the first ""serious"" gay character on a prime-time drama after being told by the producers that Blake's battle with his son over Steven's sexual identity would be the emotional and dramatic crux of the program.  This was a ground-breaking idea and a brave one in 1980 (when the show was actually shot).  Dynasty's best-written scenes in this early period are with Corley.  Kind, generous, highly intelligent, cultured, politically aware and determined to go his own way, Steven is also deeply depressed about his father's rejection of him (he is taking to drink to combat the pain) and is haunted by his hope that his father might someday love him for who he is rather than who Blake thinks he should be.  Corley's performance is quite touching and indeed, heroic, by far the best acting in the entire show.  Corley's expressive face seems to boil with repressed emotion, and the famous ""coming-out"" scene at the end of the pilot episode is a riveting piece of drama, with Blake determined to see Steven's love life as a problem or a sickness, and Steven just as determined to be himself over all objections.  It was a setup rife with real dramatic tension, and the whole thing was discarded in the second season, when Steven went straight and the whole ""gay"" theme dropped for a time.  Like Pamela Sue Martin, Corley was so disgusted by what he saw as a betrayal that he quit the show, forcing the character to be written out for a time.  Of course, if the Steven/Blake conflict were indeed going to be the true dramatic arc of the story, this would have required eventually giving Steven a real boyfriend, and that was not a risk that the producers were willing to take (then or now, just look at Will on ""Will & Grace""!).  Also making a huge mark is the sensitive, deeply touching performance of Pamela Bellwood as the unstable Claudia, who will become Steven's unlikely girlfriend.  I think the one thing which really did not turn out as hoped was the Matthew Blaisdel sub-plot.  Bo Hopkins is handsome but has no screen presence and seems strangely miscast in the role of Blake's antagonistic star geologist.  His leaden and thankless role drags the whole show down, he has no chemistry with the otherwise-charming Linda Evans and it is no wonder the character was written out after the first season!  Also, the direction of the whole thing is much more slow-paced than it would later become.  However, the sets and costumes are much more restrained and less campy here, and in fact the show as a whole seems much more ""real-world"" than it would later be - Blake, Steven and Fallon in particular seem like real people with real problems, not soapy caricatures.  In this season, we see the Dynasty that might have been had the producers not elected to keep it safe and predictable, and had not Joan Collins become such an unexpected bonus.  Required viewing and still compelling after all these years.",4,Dynasty - Without Alexis!,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,6661,"['quite', 'few', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'DVD', 'set', 'not',

Cullum,"[6, 6]","This DVD set is interesting because it includes the 1st season of DYNASTY which was radically different from what the show became after its initial year.  This season is split between ultra-rich oil tycoon Blake Carrington as he marries Krystle and decidedly middle class Matthew and Claudia Blaisdale as they struggle to put their life back together.  It was meant to be an update of UPSTAIRS,DOWNSTAIRS with the common Blaisdales contrasting the opulence of the Carringtons.  It has a lot of grit, and shows the inner workings of an oil rig -- all things that were left out once Alexis showed up in the second season and they decided to all stay in the mansion (because the network thought that would garner it higher ratings).This is how the creators originally envisioned the show.  It shows you the origins of many of your favorites - Blake, Krystle, Fallon, Steven, and Claudia are all very prominent in this season.  The DVDs are well done with about 5 hours of commentary from Esther Shapiro (a co-creator) and actor Al Corley (Steven Carrington).  The features include interviews with both Al Corley and Pamela Sue Martin (Fallon).  You get to see how they look today, and what they thought about playing on the show in this first season.  These stories were grounded and realistic when contrasted with all the crazy things that happened later on during the 8 year DYNASTY run.

881087,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0007IO6V4,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.In the debut season, we first meet oil magnate Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), the tough but fair CEO of Denver-Carrington, as he's preparing to marry former secretary Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans).  The show's opening story, ""Oil"", is spread over three episodes and sets up the characters and plots that would unfold throughout the season.Sweet-as-pie Krystle is met with all-out resentment by Blake's stuffy butler (SORRY, ""major domo"") Joseph, played to perfection by Lee Bergere, and the staff follow suit.  Meanwhile, Blake's grown children are causing their own headaches.  Wild child Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) proudly admits to bedding half the players on Carrington's football team and is also carrying on with studly chauffeur Michael (Wayne Northrop).  In the midst of all the bed-hopping comes a tantalising deal from Blake's chief rival Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner): if Fallon marries Cecil's nephew Jeff (John James, of the quizzical expressions and upturned eyebrows), he'll absorb the $9.5 million debt owed by Blake and help the continued association between Denver-Carrington and ColbyCo.Blake's son Steven (Al Corley) is another kettle of fish altogether.  Returning to Denver after spending a year in New York with his...da-da-dum...gay lover Ted (Mark Withers), Steven's relationship with his father (and sexuality) goes through some particularly bumpy patches, to say the least.  Steven was the first regular gay character on a soap and broke many boundaries.On the other side of the social divide we find the middle-class Blaisdel clan.  Matthew (Bo Hopkins) was kicked out of the Middle East, where he managed oil wells belonging to Denver-Carrington.  Lovely wife Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) has suffered a breakdown and spent a long spell in a mental institution, and daughter Lindsay (Katy ""New Adventures of Heidi"" Kurtzman) spends all her time looking like she's on the verge of bursting into tears.  Yawn.  Audiences didn't really enjoy their involvement in the show, and the Blaisdel family was written out after the first year, except for good ole ""Crazy Claudia"" who provided lots of value in some of DYNASTY's best storylines in the years to come.And what of the legendary Alexis (Joan Collins)?  Well, you'll have to stick out the entire first season before she makes her dazzling entrance as the surprise witness in the last episode.  Starting in Season 2, Alexis pulls no punches in her vendetta against Krystle and the war on Denver-Carrington.  The show is still enjoyable without Alexis, but the last few episodes seem to drag a lot in their build-up to her arrival.This set features all 15 episodes from the first season, retrospective ""Family, Furs & Fun: Creating Dynasty""; and mini featurettes on the Fallon and Steven characters including recent interviews with Pamela Sue Martin and Al Corley.Disc 1: Oil (Parts 1, 2 & 3)Disc 2: The Honeymoon / The Dinner Party / Fallon's Wedding / The Chauffeur Tells a SecretDisc 3: The Bordello / Krystle's Lie / The Necklace / The BeatingDisc 4: The Birthday Party / The Separation / Blake Goes to Jail / The Testimony",4,fabulous first season of the perfect primetime soap,1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,3494,"['ABC', 'Network', 'answer', 'hugely-popular', 'primetime', 'soap', 'Dallas', 'DYNASTY', 'was', 'created', 'Esther', 'Richard', 'Shapiro', 'be', 'most', 'flamboyant', 'daring', 'outrageous', 'night-time', 'drama', 'series', 'lives', 'Denver', 'oil-rich', 'Carrington', 'family', 'unfolded', 'week', 'fascination', 'viewers', 'world', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'scandalous', 'private', 'debut', 'season', 'first', 'meet', 'oil', 'magnate', 'Blake', 'Carrington', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'tough', 'fair', 'CEO', 'Denver-Carrington', 'preparing', 'marry', 'former', 'secretary', 'Krystle', 'Jennings', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'show', 'opening', 'story', 'Oil', 'spread', 'three', 'episodes', 'up', 'characters', 'plots', 'would', 'unfold', 'season.Sweet-as-pie', 'Krystle', 'met', 'all-out', 'resentment', 'Blake', 'stuffy', 'butler', 'SORRY', 'major', 'domo', 'Joseph', 'played', 'perfection', 'Lee', 'Bergere', 'staff', 'follow', 'suit', 'Meanwhile', 'Blake', 'grown', 'children', 'are', 'causing', 'own', 'headaches', 'Wild', 'child', 'Fallon', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'proudly', 'bedding', 'players', 'Carrington', 'football', 'team', 'also', 'carrying', 'studly', 'chauffeur', 'Michael', 'Wayne', 'Northrop', 'midst', 'bed-hopping', 'tantalising', 'deal', 'Blake', 'chief', 'rival', 'Cecil', 'Colby', 'Lloyd', 'Bochner', 'Fallon', 'Cecil', 'nephew', 'Jeff', 'John', 'James', 'quizzical', 'expressions', 'upturned', 'eyebrows', ""'ll"", 'absorb', '9.5', 'million', 'debt', 'owed', 'Blake', 'help', 'continued', 'association', 'Denver-Carrington', 'ColbyCo.Blake', 'son', 'Steven', 'Al', 'Corley', 'kettle', 'fish', 'altogether', 'Returning', 'Denver', 'spending', 'year', 'New', 'York', 'da-da-dum', 'gay', 'lover', 'Ted', 'Mark', 'Withers', 'Steven', 'relationship', 'father', 'sexuality', 'particularly', 'bumpy', 'patches', 'say', 'least', 'Steven', 'was', 'first', 'regular', 'gay', 'character', 'soap', 'broke', 'many', 'boundaries.On', 'other', 'side', 'social', 'divide', 'find', 'middle-class', 'Blaisdel', 'clan', 'Matthew', 'Bo', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'kicked', 'Middle', 'East', 'where', 'managed', 'oil', 'wells', 'belonging', 'Denver-Carrington', 'Lovely', 'wife', 'Claudia', 'Pamela', 'Bellwood', 'suffered', 'breakdown', 'spent', 'long', 'spell', 'mental', 'institution', 'daughter', 'Lindsay', 'Katy', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Heidi', 'Kurtzman', 'time', 'looking', 'verge', 'bursting', 'tears', 'Yawn', 'Audiences', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'involvement', 'show', 'Blaisdel', 'family', 'was', 'written', 'out', 'first', 'year', 'good', 'ole', 'Crazy', 'Claudia', 'who', 'provided', 'lots', 'value', 'DYNASTY', 'best', 'storylines', 'years', 'come.And', 'what', 'legendary', 'Alexis', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'have', 'stick', 'out', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'dazzling', 'entrance', 'surprise', 'witness', 'last', 'episode', 'Starting', 'Season', '2', 'Alexis', 'punches', 'vendetta', 'Krystle', 'war', 'Denver-Carrington', 'show', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'Alexis', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'seem', 'drag', 'lot', 'build-up', 'arrival.This', 'set', '15', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'retrospective', 'Family', 'Furs', 'Fun', 'Creating', 'Dynasty', 'mini', 'featurettes', 'Fallon', 'Steven', 'characters', 'including', 'recent', 'interviews', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'Al', 'Corley.Disc', '1', 'Oil', 'Parts', '1', '2', '3', 'Disc', '2', 'Honeymoon', '/', 'Dinner', 'Party', '/', 'Fallon', 'Wedding', 'Chauffeur', 'Tells', 'SecretDisc', '3', 'Bordello', '/', 'Krystle', 'Lie', '/', 'Necklace', '/', 'BeatingDisc', '4', 'Birthday', 'Party', '/', 'Separation', '/', 'Blake', 'Goes', 'Jail', '/', 'Testimony']",Dynasty: Season 1

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[4, 4]","When TV producer Aaron Spelling found a network for ""Dynasty"" in 1981, the inside joke was that ABC spelled Aaron's Broadcasting Company. Little wonder, given Spelling's dominance of the network in the 70's (""Love Boat,"" ""Fantasy Island,"" ""Charlie's Angels""). It is little surprise, then, that ABC challenged CBS' own dynasty of prime time soaps (""Dallas,"" ""Falcon Crest"" and ""Knot's Landing) with this series, originally dubbed - uninspiringly - ""Oil."" Mercifully retitled ""Dynasty,"" cast as Denver oil baron Blake Carrington, John Forsythe finally got to be seen after five years as the faceless Charlie of ""Angels"" fame. Throw in his pending marriage to a former secretary, Krystle Jennings, idelibly Linda Evans' most recognizable personna, and throw in a couple of his kids, spoiled and pampered Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) and openly gay son (Al Corley) Steven (open, but not flaming), an arch-nemisis (Cecil Colby) running a competing oil company - and don't forget the millions and billions of bucks that everyone seems to have - and you've got the groundwork for a mega-hit series that lasted nine years. In this, ""Dynasty's"" freshman season, we learn that scads of power and wealth don't spare its privileged few from some of the same stuff that hits the not-so-powerful and less-than-wealthy, like Blake pushing daughter Fallon into marrying the son of his corporate arch-enemy and her predictable shove-it response, Steven pining over his fractured relationship with Big Daddy Blake after Papa catches Junior in a gay affair. And Krystle? The heart-of-gold (with locks to match) bombshell whose beauty is the Titanic's iceberg has to fret about her transition from working girl and vaulting up a social ladder she fears is too high for her. And she also has to soothe her former lover (Matthew Blaisdel), a geologist for her husband's oil company and who already has his hands full with mentally unhinged wife Claudia. And the season's first cliffhanger gives us Blake on trial for killing his son's gay lover and freeze frames on each central character as the prosecution calls to the stand Blake's long-divorced and long-absent first wife, a veiled and shrouded-in-black Alexis (an omen of seasons to come?). We all know by now that Joan Collins showed up under the veil the next season, but she hadn't been cast for the role and a stand-in used in the first-season wrapup. Some critics here have bemoaned the slow issuance of subsequent seasons because Collins isn't part of the first year. Geez, with Linda Evans, who wants or needs more? Talk about greed!

The DVD set includes all thirteen episodes from the first season of the nightime drama which changed television forever.Although the show is probably best known for it's vixen Alexis Carrington Colby, the show was not built around Alexis in the beginning although many of the storylines later tied into the character. The show was built around multi-millionaire business tycoon Blake Carrington, his children Fallon and Steven and his new wife, the former Krystal Jennings.Krystal formerly worked as Blake's secretary. During season one Krystal has to make the transition from former working girl to the wife of a very rich man. She promises her friends that she will never change, but how can she remain the same with Blake and all of his money? After she weds Blake, Krystal instantly becomes the step-mother to two very complex adult children. Krystal also is dealing with a former lover who has recently returned from the Middle East.Fallon is a wild child who is having an affair with Blakes limo driver. The first Fallon was played by Pamela Sue Martin. She molded that character and really brought the character to life. The character was later played by Emma Samms but many Dynasty fans still consider Pamela Sue Martin the real Fallon. Al Corley played Steven during the first season. Steven had a very interesting storyline. He was one of the first characters openly gay on a night time drama. Even though the character of Steven was gay, he still had a lot of interaction with women in his storyline, sex and the whole nine.Missing from season one are popular characters Sammy Joe, Adam, and the aforementioned Alexis. The show is still chock full of drama and characters like Fallon and Claudia keep the storyline interesting. It's a really great show and the writing during the first season was great.Dynasty, Dallas, Falcon Crest and Knots Landing were the really big nightime soap opera like one hour series of the 80's. The first two seasons of Dallas are now available on DVD, and this is the first season of Dynasty released on DVD. Hopefully, future seasons will follow soon.Extras included on the set include commentary from the shows co-creator on several episodes, character profiles for the characters of Steven and Fallon and a featured titled, ""Family, Furs and Fun: Creating Dynasty."" The thirteen episodes are included on four dual sided discs. The packaging is really amazing with bright color photos on the cases that jump out at you.

It's easy to like Dynasty because in Charlie's Angels you always hear John Forsythe's voice but never meet the character.  So in Dynasty, it's almost as if it's telling Charlie's story.  And who better to tell these stories than creator Aaron Spelling responsible for both Angel and Dynasty.The DVD transfer was very close to the picture quality that I remembered watching on TV.  It definitely has the 80s film-color to it.  I like the packaging especially with the brief summary of each episode and the air date!",5,Pamela Sue Martin!!,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,794,"['DVD', 'fans', '80s', 'are', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'year', 'release', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Mysteries', 'now', 'Dynasty', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'was', 'boy', 'dream', 'hair', 'everybody', '80s', 'cameo', 'corded', 'telephone', 'Shiny', 'lips', 'one', 'had', 'cell', 'phone', 'easy', 'like', 'Dynasty', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'always', 'hear', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'voice', 'never', 'meet', 'character', 'So', 'Dynasty', 'almost', 'telling', 'Charlie', 'story', 'who', 'better', 'tell', 'stories', 'creator', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'responsible', 'Angel', 'Dynasty.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'picture', 'quality', 'remembered', 'watching', 'TV', 'definitely', '80s', 'film-color', 'packaging', 'especially', 'brief', 'summary', 'episode', 'air', 'date']",Dynasty: Season 1

I got hooked on it when the show was in late-night syndication here in Canada in the late 80s/early 90s.Since I never watched it during its original run I guess I never saw the first season episodes included in this set before, and so I was quite shocked and disappointed to find that my favourite element of the show and my whole reason for buying this set -- the delectable Joan Collins chewing up the scenery as deliciously nasty Alexis -- is completely absent from the first season episodes!Yes the episodes in this set do give me a lot more background on various characters and storylines, but without Alexis the show really lacks that extra ""something"", and never really seems to rise above the level of your typical soap. So all in all, this set felt more like a prequel to the ""real"" Dynasty, which it looks like only actually got rolling in Season 2.So hurry up and bring us Season 2, because that's the Dynasty that I really want to see!As for the DVDs, since Dynasty started its first season as a mid-season replacement series, there are only 13 episodes here. In such a case I think it would have been smarter to include the full Seasons 1 & 2 in one set the way some other shows like ""Moonlighting"" and ""Sliders"" have, but oh well...The set also includes a nice documentary on the making of the show plus commentaries on certain episodes from series creator Esther Shapiro and actor Al Corley (Steven Carrington).The 4 discs are packed in a handy space-saving 2 slipcase format. And I loved the package and menu design which features beautifully glittering diamonds, capturing perfectly the spirit of decadent opulence which permeates the show.All in all a nice little package, but I still need my Season 2 with Joan Collins.

881096,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B0007IO6V4,Edward Aycock,"[2, 3]","Before this past month, I had seen ""Dynasty"" only once: at the age of 9 in September of 1981 when I was in the hospital recovering from an appendectomy.  It was the rebroadcast of the episode when Blake attacks Steven's ex, Ted.  While watching the episode on DVD, I was surprised at how much of it I remembered and was also struck by how seminal that episode ended up being.There are some slow moments in the first season, notably in the early episodes.  Once Fallon marries Jeff, things start to take off.  The cast is good.  I had reservations about Pamela Sue Martin at first, but she won me over as Fallon.  Martin has a wonderful command of Fallon and her scenes with Al Corley as her brother Steve are well done.  John James as Jeff Colby seems to be having a great time and his eyebrows are as demonstrative as the rest of him.  I'm surprised at how unsympathetic the character of Blake is, but he's counterbalanced by the radiant Linda Evans as Krystle.The first season of ""Dynasty"" was a show trying to find its legs.  After this season, major characters were written out and the show felt less like a Denver version of ""Dallas."". Joan Collins was brought in and the oil rig story was phased out entirely though thankfully Pamela Bellwood was retained as Claudia.  The show's ratings rose and it became must watch TV for many on Wednesday nights, so many may be surprised by the first season's different pace and tone.I'm struck by how excellent the picture quality is of this DVD.  There's barely an imperfect frame. These episodes could have been broadcast yesterday for all the age they show.  Also, don't be fooled by the teaser photo of Alexis on the box; she appears in the last 30 seconds of the final episode.",4,Oil,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,1727,"['past', 'month', 'had', 'seen', 'Dynasty', 'only', 'once', 'age', '9', 'September', '1981', 'when', 'was', 'hospital', 'recovering', 'appendectomy', 'was', 'rebroadcast', 'episode', 'when', 'Blake', 'Steven', 'ex', 'Ted', 'watching', 'episode', 'DVD', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'remembered', 'was', 'also', 'struck', 'how', 'seminal', 'episode', 'ended', 'up', 'being.There', 'are', 'slow', 'moments', 'first', 'season', 'notably', 'early', 'episodes', 'Once', 'Fallon', 'marries', 'Jeff', 'things', 'start', 'take', 'off', 'cast', 'good', 'had', 'reservations', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'first', 'won', 'over', 'Fallon', 'Martin', 'wonderful', 'command', 'Fallon', 'scenes', 'Al', 'Corley', 'brother', 'Steve', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'John', 'James', 'Jeff', 'Colby', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'eyebrows', 'are', 'as', 'demonstrative', 'rest', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'Blake', 'counterbalanced', 'radiant', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'Krystle.The', 'first', 'season', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'show', 'trying', 'find', 'legs', 'season', 'major', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'out', 'show', 'felt', 'less', 'Denver', 'version', 'Dallas.', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'was', 'brought', 'oil', 'rig', 'story', 'was', 'phased', 'out', 'entirely', 'thankfully', 'Pamela', 'Bellwood', 'was', 'retained', 'Claudia', 'show', 'ratings', 'rose', 'became', 'must', 'watch', 'TV', 'many', 'Wednesday', 'nights', 'so', 'many', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'first', 'season', 'different', 'pace', 'tone.I', ""'m"", 'struck', 'how', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'barely', 'imperfect', 'frame', 'episodes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'broadcast', 'yesterday', 'age', 'show', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'teaser', 'photo', 'Alexis', 'box', 'last', '30', 'seconds', 'final', 'episode']",Dynasty: Season 1

881101,A213FO12B3XYV3,B0007IO6V4,Iceblue,"[3, 4]","I'd only started collecting TV shows on DVD this year.  I realized just about any show is now available in this format, which has been the highlight of '07 for me.  I wondered what show I'd like to have, and Dynasty came to mind.  Imagine my delight when I realized the first season has been released.  However, I didn't buy it yet as I remembered Dynasty started late in its first season, like Dallas, Fantasy Island, Grey's Anatomy, to name some.  I decided to wait until Season 2 is released, to see if 2-packs for both seasons might be available.  You know the rest; someone else here stated it's cheaper and I finally ordered the 2-pack.  They arrived within a week and a half in good condition.  I really appreciate the company for bundling them together; that's what I'd do for every show that starts late if I'm in charge of DVD releases.Some actors had yet to appear that'd put this series on the map, like Joan Collins and Heather Locklear, to name two.  If Dynasty did fare well at any time in the ratings during the first season, it must've been strictly by an episode or two as the series didn't make the top 25 overall for the season.  Those expecting to see the aforementioned actors here will be disappointed as they didn't arrive until the sophomore season; if good writing is expected or if you'd like to know what started it all that got us Dynasty fans yakking about at the water cooler on Thursdays, then do check this one out.  I'd say it's worth a look.Actually, I'd never watched Dynasty until its 6th season when I was in college.  Some friends told me how great it was and they kept telling me I should check it out.  I didn't care but decided to give it a try, but sure enough I got hooked.  Wednesday nights became Dynasty nights for me.  One friend told me she's practically dead to the world when it's on--she ignores the phone, the door, etc. everything and everyone that breathes until the closing credits roll.  I  also remember this show being described as larger than life.  Anyway, I'd watch the show for a while until I had to focus some more on my studies, when I'd lost interest in it altogether, or when I noticed the catfights seemed to finally become a thing of the past.  What a time we had to enjoy the beauties that defined devastatingly wealthy excess for us.I'd already finished watching Season 1.  I had mixed feelings about this one at first given its early storylines but told myself to hang in there until the hiss-worthy Alexis finally charms her way into our DVD players, to put it somewhat questionably.  It's been a wait but worth it.

While I found the start of Season One to be a slow start, I soon found myself very interested in the storylines as the episodes progressed. DYNASTY was a wonderful show and I can't wait for more seasons to be released! In Season One we meet Krystal and Blake, who get married. Krystal used to be Blake's secretary and is unaccustomed to the rich lifestyle. His daughter Fallon doesn't like Krystal at all and uses any opportunity to show this. She marries Jeff to make a business deal. Matthew is a hard working man who is reunited with his wife Claudia who was in a mental institution. She slowly starts to adapt to life again, and repairing her relationship with Matthew and her daughter. We also focus on Steven, Blake's son who is a homosexual. He struggles with it, and it was very accurately portrayed in my opinion. His on and off again boyfriend Ted visits a few times. He has an affair with Matthew's wife Claudia. Blake finds out that Steven and Ted are together saying goodbye, and goes to do something about it. He gets in a scuffle with Ted and pushes him. Ted falls down and hits his head and dies, and Blake goes on trial for murder. It is then when Steven and Claudia's affair is revealed and Matthew attacks Blake, and is arrested. Claudia flees with her daughter and they are in a car accident, Matthew finds out and asks to be released from jail to see them. Also, Blake's ex-wife Alexis shows up. The role that Joan Collins would begin playing in Season 2.It was definately a drama filled, action packed season. Although, many of the characters would not return in the second season. Matthew and Claudia's daughter would not be seen after the car crash. In season 2, Matthew flees with his daughter and only Matthew returns in one of the later seasons.Overall a great DVD and it makes me excited to buy the other seasons when they are released!",5,Dynasty,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,1887,"['truly', 'treat', 'found', 'start', 'Season', 'One', 'be', 'slow', 'start', 'soon', 'found', 'very', 'interested', 'storylines', 'episodes', 'progressed', 'DYNASTY', 'was', 'wonderful', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more', 'seasons', 'be', 'released', 'Season', 'One', 'meet', 'Krystal', 'Blake', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'Krystal', 'used', 'be', 'Blake', 'secretary', 'unaccustomed', 'rich', 'lifestyle', 'daughter', 'Fallon', ""n't"", 'like', 'Krystal', 'opportunity', 'show', 'Jeff', 'make', 'business', 'deal', 'Matthew', 'hard', 'working', 'man', 'who', 'reunited', 'wife', 'Claudia', 'who', 'was', 'mental', 'institution', 'slowly', 'adapt', 'life', 'again', 'repairing', 'relationship', 'Matthew', 'daughter', 'also', 'focus', 'Steven', 'Blake', 'son', 'who', 'homosexual', 'was', 'very', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'opinion', 'off', 'again', 'boyfriend', 'Ted', 'few', 'times', 'affair', 'Matthew', 'wife', 'Claudia', 'Blake', 'out', 'Steven', 'Ted', 'are', 'together', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'do', 'something', 'scuffle', 'Ted', 'Ted', 'down', 'head', 'dies', 'Blake', 'trial', 'murder', 'then', 'when', 'Steven', 'Claudia', 'affair', 'revealed', 'Matthew', 'attacks', 'Blake', 'arrested', 'Claudia', 'daughter', 'are', 'car', 'accident', 'Matthew', 'out', 'be', 'released', 'jail', 'see', 'Also', 'Blake', 'ex-wife', 'Alexis', 'up', 'role', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'would', 'begin', 'playing', 'Season', '2.It', 'was', 'definately', 'drama', 'filled', 'action', 'packed', 'season', 'many', 'characters', 'would', 'not', 'return', 'second', 'season', 'Matthew', 'Claudia', 'daughter', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'car', 'crash', 'season', '2', 'Matthew', 'daughter', 'only', 'Matthew', 'returns', 'one', 'later', 'seasons.Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'excited', 'buy', 'other', 'seasons', 'when', 'are', 'released']",Dynasty: Season 1

I watched this from the begining but that was years ago, so this was interesting the rewatch. I was a tad bummed that the 2nd season wasn't released at the same time, as that is when Joan Collins, joined and the show kicked-off into high gear and never looked back. Also past the first season was the star making debut of screen siren, Heather Locklear. This series is where ""Melrose Place"" got it's roots. And this is the show that obviously got it's cue from the early 70's Spelling horror/soapy camp-fest television movie, ""Home for the holidays,"" starring Jill Haworth and Sally Field. One thing's for certain though, Pamela Sue Martin was the best Fallon Carrington. She really was commiting career suicide when she left this show to pursue an ill-fated movie career.(Where is she now??) And Al Corley was clearly the best Stephen Carrington(kicked off the show for pushing the producers to stand behind gay issues of his character).

Pity though to neglect Pamela Sue Martin from the front cover.

It's kind of weird seeing it right from the start, but it puts it all into place.Initially this season is a little boring (because we're desparately waiting Joan Collins' arrival), but after the first couple of episodes, you'll probably be hooked.  It's got a trashy storyline (all soaps do), but that's what makes it so good.  For some reason, soaps hook you in and this is no exception.  In a mini nutshell, it's about the wealthy and the real working class trying to merge lives.  Blake marries Krystal who finds it hard trying to fit into this new lifestyle.  Not everyone is happy with her (Blakes daughter for one) and it tells the story of his 'corupt' company and the people he steps on to get to the top.  It's great.If there is one fault about the dvd that I don't like, it's that there is only two episodes per dvd and it's a pain in the you-know-where to have to keep getting up to change it over (when you're in a hurry to catch the next episode).  Anyway, other than that, I love this show.

881116,A1GE1H2W7UH3K4,B0007IO6V4,"Motown Fan ""Mr. Music""","[5, 7]","I am very excited to see Dynasty released on DVD.  I NEVER was a Dallas fan.  Dynasty was simply the greatest nighttime soap ever!  Outstanding picture quality.  Great extras.  Loved the commentaries and new interviews with the REAL Steven and Fallon.  I would have liked to have seen included the teasers at the end/beginning of each episode as when it originally aired (""Next/Last Time, on Dynasty"").  The first season starts slow, and picks up when Alexis arrives in season 2.  But, there are plenty of reasons that this season is a must have.  There was a true sense of heartfelt honesty in Al Corley's performance as he embodies the character of Steven, and it only goes to show what a brilliant actor he is.  Pamela Sue Martin and Al Corley in my opinion always gave standout performances and are the reason I love this show.  While I THOUGHT that I learned in time to come to terms with and accept their replacements (I came to enjoy Jack Coleman in later seasons, though I always preferred Al Corley), when I watch these episodes again, it is clear to me that there is only ONE actress who could ever portray Fallon Carrington, and she was NOT Emma Samms.  While I'm sure Ms. Samms is a great actress in her own right, she will NEVER be Fallon for me.  Never!  Case in point, Fallon despised Sammy Jo at all times, but near the end of the series when the characters got in a fight that turned out to be a mud slinging event, they eventually laughed and made up.  Are you KIDDING ME?  Fallon hated Sammy Jo.  This scene could have NEVER happened if they hadn't ruined the character of Fallon.  What an injustice the producers and everyone involved did to the die hard fans in casting an actress so night-and-day different than Pamela Sue to portray one of the most popular characters in the series.  What a huge mistake.  Why Why Why?  She did not look the same (hello?!), she did not act the same (the fake Fallon acted like she was constantly a victim, crying and feeling sorry for herself, unlike the carefree, lovable, scheming vixen the REAL Fallon was), and she did not SOUND the same (they never bothered to explain how she mysteriously picked up an English accent).  As far as I'm concerned, it was a totally different character altogether (same thing when they replaced Catherine Oxenberg's Amanda with that no name, but the sting from the Fallon substitute was FAR worse).  It's no wonder why The Colby's never really caught on.  Viewers just can't accept a Fallon replacement, no matter who it is.  Pamela Sue Martin's Fallon was the spark that drove the first season from start to finish, right up to her final episode.  You can't deny, she stole every scene she was in!!  As far as I'm concerned, when she left the show, the show officially died.  In time maybe I'll be able to come to terms with the fact that they ever thought that they could replace her.  And even so, what a very bad choice.  This is unexplainable and unforgivable to me, a true Dynasty fan from the beginning.  One last thing.  Who in the world was in charge of designing the box for this season???  Fallon was totally robbed.  She earned the right to be on the cover with Blake and Krystle, as SHE was the one that provided the conflict that drove the early episodes.  I hope that Pamela Sue Martin and Al Corley will participate with even more extras and commentaries in the future (as well as the other stars like Linda Evans, John Forsythe, and John James), because they still have so many fans out here that love them!",5,Pamela Sue Martin will ALWAYS be the ONLY Fallon for me!!!,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,3515,"['am', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'Dynasty', 'released', 'DVD', 'NEVER', 'was', 'Dallas', 'fan', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'simply', 'greatest', 'nighttime', 'soap', 'ever', 'Outstanding', 'picture', 'quality', 'Great', 'extras', 'Loved', 'commentaries', 'new', 'interviews', 'REAL', 'Steven', 'Fallon', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'included', 'teasers', 'end/beginning', 'episode', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'Next/Last', 'Time', 'Dynasty', 'first', 'season', 'slow', 'up', 'when', 'Alexis', 'season', '2', 'are', 'plenty', 'reasons', 'season', 'must', 'have', 'was', 'true', 'sense', 'heartfelt', 'honesty', 'Al', 'Corley', 'performance', 'character', 'Steven', 'only', 'show', 'what', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'Al', 'Corley', 'opinion', 'always', 'gave', 'standout', 'performances', 'are', 'reason', 'love', 'show', 'THOUGHT', 'learned', 'time', 'come', 'terms', 'accept', 'replacements', 'came', 'enjoy', 'Jack', 'Coleman', 'later', 'seasons', 'always', 'preferred', 'Al', 'Corley', 'when', 'watch', 'episodes', 'again', 'clear', 'only', 'ONE', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'ever', 'portray', 'Fallon', 'Carrington', 'was', 'NOT', 'Emma', 'Samms', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Ms.', 'Samms', 'great', 'actress', 'own', 'right', 'will', 'NEVER', 'be', 'Fallon', 'Never', 'Case', 'point', 'Fallon', 'despised', 'Sammy', 'Jo', 'times', 'end', 'series', 'when', 'characters', 'got', 'fight', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'mud', 'slinging', 'event', 'eventually', 'laughed', 'made', 'up', 'Are', 'ME', 'Fallon', 'hated', 'Sammy', 'Jo', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'NEVER', 'happened', 'had', ""n't"", 'ruined', 'character', 'Fallon', 'What', 'injustice', 'producers', 'everyone', 'involved', 'did', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'casting', 'actress', 'so', 'night-and-day', 'different', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'portray', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'characters', 'series', 'What', 'huge', 'mistake', 'Why', 'Why', 'Why', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'same', 'hello', 'did', 'not', 'act', 'same', 'fake', 'Fallon', 'acted', 'was', 'constantly', 'victim', 'crying', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'herself', 'carefree', 'lovable', 'scheming', 'REAL', 'Fallon', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'SOUND', 'same', 'never', 'bothered', 'explain', 'how', 'mysteriously', 'picked', 'up', 'English', 'accent', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'character', 'altogether', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'replaced', 'Catherine', 'Oxenberg', 'Amanda', 'name', 'sting', 'Fallon', 'substitute', 'was', 'FAR', 'worse', 'wonder', 'why', 'Colby', 'never', 'really', 'caught', 'Viewers', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'Fallon', 'replacement', 'matter', 'who', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'Fallon', 'was', 'spark', 'drove', 'first', 'season', 'start', 'finish', 'right', 'up', 'final', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'when', 'left', 'show', 'show', 'officially', 'died', 'time', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'ever', 'thought', 'could', 'replace', 'even', 'so', 'what', 'very', 'bad', 'choice', 'unexplainable', 'unforgivable', 'true', 'Dynasty', 'fan', 'beginning', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'Who', 'world', 'was', 'charge', 'designing', 'box', 'season', 'Fallon', 'was', 'totally', 'robbed', 'earned', 'right', 'be', 'cover', 'Blake', 'Krystle', 'SHE', 'was', 'one', 'provided', 'conflict', 'drove', 'early', 'episodes', 'hope', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'Al', 'Corley', 'will', 'participate', 'even', 'more', 'extras', 'commentaries', 'future', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'stars', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'John', 'James', 'still', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'out', 'here', 'love']",Dynasty: Season 1

881121,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B0007IO6V4,Retro Pixie,"[2, 2]","Against a backdrop of the glistening snow-capped mountains of Colorado and the sprawling Carrington estate, the real stars of this show line up in contrast to that beauty...Let's meet them:  Greed, Deceit, Power, Cattiness, Adultery and your basic Hatred.  You know... everything you need to make a night-time soap as sudsy as possible, and, oh, let me tell you... ""Dynasty"" was surrounded in those bubbles.When Krystle tells her fianc&eacute;, Blake Carrington, that she would like Chinese food and doesn't want to go to an expensive restaurant, he fires up his jet and they zoom off to San Francisco...to Chinatown.  That's classic oil tycoon Blake. And this is quintessential ""Dynasty.""  Big lives, great wealth and glamour as far as the eye can see.  Welcome to the 80's, where we dreamed in glorious Technicolor and liked our entertainment just as glorious and over the top.The first season started in January of 1981, so it's shorter with 13 episodes plus a two-hour movie that introduced the series.  It was Aaron Spelling's answer to ""Dallas.""  And his answer to Dallas' boots and Stetsons?  Tuxes and jewels.And if ever there were two people who represented elegance, beauty and wealth, it would be John Forsythe and Linda Evans as Blake and Krystle Carrington.  He's dapper; she's refined.  He has a golden voice; she has jewel-like eyes.  These chiseled, specimens of pulchritude must have made central casting jump up and down with glee the first time they saw them in a tux and evening gown.The stories revolve around Blake and Krystle, their new marriage and the problems a nice, soft-spoken girl from Ohio has fitting in with his power-hungry lifestyle.  The cast of characters around them causing conflict and distress are:Fallon - Blake's spoiled daughter from his first marriage.  She is sleeping her way through Denver...chauffeurs, Denver Broncos, her father's friends...you name it.  Pamela Sue Martin brings humor to this part and is very enjoyable every time she's on the screen.Steven - Blake's son from his first marriage is gay, but then he's bi-sexual - mostly because I think the show couldn't make up their minds.  At any rate, Al Corley plays the part beautifully.  He's never a caricature.  Frankly, some of the actors portraying gay characters today could take a lesson or two.Jeff Colby - Fallon's new husbandMatthew Blaisdel - Krystle's former boyfriend and Blake's former employeeClaudia Blaisdel - Matthew's wife, who just got out of a mental-health hospital.And...the Clothes - Yes, that's right.  I'm that girl.  The clothes are a character to me.  Or maybe I should say designer Nolan Miller was.  Everyone looks beautiful, and Linda Evans has gorgeous gowns and even beautiful everyday clothes.  Ah, a girl can dream.There are more characters, but that's the core group contributing to all of the crazy.  With Matthew and Claudia, the show goes away from the mansion from time to time, but the creators said the audience always wanted to be in the world of wealth, which is where the stories were focused after season one.  Anyone looking for Joan Collins should know she doesn't show up until the second season.  We get a glimpse of her character, but never see her face.  The producers wanted to hire Joan, but the network executives thought she was too old.  Creator Esther Shapiro said they fought about it over the summer.  I wonder if anyone was pushed into a pool...The DVD quality is excellent, the colors are beautiful and there are some good extras:  Character profiles, Esther Shapiro and Al Corley do commentary on a few episodes and ""Family, Furs and Fun:  Creating Dynasty"" with William and Esther Shapiro, Corley and Pamela Sue Martin.I highly recommend ""Dynasty.""

And that is my name "". Both Joan Collins, by-the-by. And since La Collins isn't in this series at all (the walk-on, nonspeaking role of Alexis at the very end of the very last episode is played by a different actress), it falls far, far short of the mark set by later seasons.Dynasty's not about finely-acted drama, beautifully-directed scenes or Pulitzer-worthy dialogue. What is was about, was Excess. The most satisfying part of the whole show was watching the dual apsects of Crime and Retribution played out against a backdrop of oil-stained Money, and this is a key element that, sadly, Season One lacks in spades.Instead of the glamorous and preposterous situations of UFO Abductions, Plastic Surgery altering more than just an outward appearance, and catfights where sequins are literally used as projectiles, we have to put up with interminable scene after interminable scene of Steven Carrington (TV's least likeable gay man since Coco the Golden Girls' Cook - remember him?? Thought not :-) and his Whiney Angst, Crazy Claudia and her Looney Angst, sappy Michael Blaisdale and his Lovetorn Angst, and a Krystle Carrington that Linda Evans must have really loathed playing - she looks like she couldn't possibly have been more bored!!The final four episodes show the inklings of the beginning of Dynasty as we knew and loved it - glitzy murders, divided loyalties, and Krystle in a very faithful pastiche to Faye Dunaway's Pepsi-Cola boardroom sequence from Mommie Dearest - but the rest of the episodes, for me, focus far too much on the cotton (Blaisdale, Michael the Wicked Chauffeur, whiney angsty boring Steven) and not enough on the silk (Fallon, and... uh... Fallon?).Unless you're a huge completist, don't bother.

During the 1980's the big budget soaps like ""Dallas"", and ""Dynasty"" succeeded in doing just that all over the world. I know in my household at 8.30pm on Monday nights the phone was taken off the hook, the dishes were already washed and put away, and the popcorn was at the ready so that we could sit back and enjoy uninterrupted the latest larger than life traumas and heartbreaks encountered  by television's most outrageously dysfunctional family, the hugely rich Carringtons. We didn't tune in expecting to see nice people like in ""The Waltons"", instead we, like people everwhere, tuned in to lap up the glamour, double dealings, infidelities and memorable bitchy cat fights that made ""Dynasty"" such totally great fun to watch.Reliving the at times rather unglamourous beginnings of ""Dynasty"" in the ""Complete First Series"", has been a great joy for me over this last month and has been highly interesting viewing especially when one considers what the series became after the dramatic second season entry of the unforgettable villianess Alexis, Blake Carrington's long absent first wife, played to perfection by Joan Collins. Immediately a very different series was born however I have to give this first, (half) season its due in that while lacking the later season's glamour and over the top storylines and excitement, it still sustains great interest and sets up the scenario of the oil rich Carringtons and the Colbys. It also allows many of the performers such as the wickedly wonderful Pamela Sue Martin, Al Corley, and Pamela Bellwood  the opportunity to really shine in their own storylines before the arrival of the ""Alexis Juggernaut"" changed the series forever.",5,The Rather Non Glitzy Beginning To Television's Most  Glamourous And Outrageous 1980's Prime Time Soap,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,1838,"['When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'can', 'recall', 'home', 'life', 'literally', 'stopping', 'when', 'hour', 'arrived', 'when', 'favourite', 'night', 'time', 'program', 'aired', 'prime', 'time', 'television', '1980', 'big', 'budget', 'soaps', 'Dallas', 'Dynasty', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'just', 'world', 'know', 'household', '8.30pm', 'Monday', 'phone', 'was', 'taken', 'off', 'hook', 'dishes', 'were', 'already', 'washed', 'put', 'away', 'popcorn', 'was', 'ready', 'so', 'could', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'uninterrupted', 'latest', 'larger', 'life', 'traumas', 'heartbreaks', 'encountered', 'television', 'most', 'outrageously', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'hugely', 'rich', 'Carringtons', 'did', ""n't"", 'tune', 'expecting', 'see', 'nice', 'people', 'Waltons', 'instead', 'people', 'everwhere', 'tuned', 'lap', 'up', 'glamour', 'double', 'dealings', 'infidelities', 'memorable', 'bitchy', 'cat', 'fights', 'made', 'Dynasty', 'such', 'totally', 'great', 'fun', 'watch.Reliving', 'times', 'rather', 'unglamourous', 'beginnings', 'Dynasty', 'Complete', 'First', 'Series', 'been', 'great', 'joy', 'last', 'month', 'been', 'highly', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'what', 'series', 'became', 'dramatic', 'second', 'season', 'entry', 'unforgettable', 'villianess', 'Alexis', 'Blake', 'Carrington', 'long', 'absent', 'first', 'wife', 'played', 'perfection', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Immediately', 'very', 'different', 'series', 'was', 'born', 'however', 'have', 'give', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'due', 'lacking', 'later', 'season', 'glamour', 'top', 'storylines', 'excitement', 'still', 'great', 'interest', 'up', 'scenario', 'oil', 'rich', 'Carringtons', 'Colbys', 'also', 'many', 'performers', 'such', 'wickedly', 'wonderful', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'Al', 'Corley', 'Pamela', 'Bellwood', 'opportunity', 'really', 'shine', 'own', 'storylines', 'arrival', 'Alexis', 'Juggernaut', 'changed', 'series', 'forever']",Dynasty: Season 1

Passion, glamour, catfights, and the biggest shoulder pads in Denver. DYNASTY, was the primetime soap fueled by an all-star cast and ""sexsational"" storylines.Relive the wrestling matches between Alexis and Krystle, Steven's scandalous romances, Fallon's affairs with practically everybody, and of course, the power struggles at Denver-Carrington, led by the magnetic Blake Carrington.DYNASTY was an awesome over-the-top nighttime soap opera about a bunch of rich-people humping each other that ran on ABC from Monday January 12, 1981 thru Thursday May 11, 1989 that was in competition with CBS's prime-time soap opera DALLAS, which debuted in the Spring of 1978, plus DYNASTY revolved around a wealthy oil family living in Denver, Colorado by powerful oil tycoon Blake and his new wife who is also Blake's former secretary Krystle.DYNASTY was originally supposed to make its debut on ABC in the Fall of 1980, but was delayed till the Winter of 1981, due to a strike precipated by animosity.This popular series ratings for the 1st Season were unremarkable, but the 2nd Season with the arrival of Alexis and Heather Locklear as Krystal's sexy greedy niece(Sammy Jo Dean)in the Fall of 1981 heralded DYNASTY's arise into the Top 20 in the Nielsen ratings and by 1984 DYNASTY was a Top 10 show and by 1985, it was the #1 series on television and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Drama series every year from 1981-1986, winning in 1984, but then DYNASTY dropped from #7 to #24 in the ratings during its 1986-87 Season and was ultimately cancelled in the Spring of 1989 after its 9th Season and 8 1/2 year run on ABC, due to a severe decline in ratings.George Peppard who is known as the brainy on-the-run Vietnam veteran(Col. Hannibal Smith)on THE A-TEAM was originally given the role of Blake Carrington in the Autumn of 1980, but was quickly replaced with John Forsythe since Peppard had difficulties dealing with the somewhat unsympathetic role of patriarch Blake Carrington along with the fact that Forsythe who died in the Spring of 2011 was the only cast member to appear in all 220 episodes of DYNASTY.Part of what made this show so popular and kept it going strong for so long were the catfights and physical altercations that frequently occured between Alexis & Krystle since Alexis was always interferring in the lives of Krystle & Blake's family and friends along with the fact that DYNASTY was the first TV show to use the word ""Bitch"" on television on top of that.Additionally, DYNASTY along with the premiere of the police drama T.J. HOOKER in the Spring of 1982 had launched Heather Locklear's acting career and made her a star since Locklear was also doing her role as the sexy Officer Stacey Sheridan on that show at the same time at one time too, but then Locklear had went onto co-starring as the sassy Amanda Woodward on MELROSE PLACE back in 1992 along with the fact that MELROSE PLACE was similar to DYNASTY since it had a lot of steamy sex in it like DYNASTY along with the fact that there was always a lot of humping around on both shows since everybody slept with everybody on MELROSE PLACE having frequent affairs with one another, especially in Amand's apartment complex in L.A. along with the fact that Locklear's Amanda character was quite similar to her Sammy Jo character on top of that as if DYNASTY had inspired the premiere of MELROSE PLACE, which was a spin-off series of BEVERLY HILLS 90210.The 1981-82 Season of DYNASTY also takes me all the way back to memory lane when this show was part of ABC's Wednesday night line-up starting with THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO at 8PM followed by THE FALL GUY at 9PM, and then topped off with DYNASTY at 10PM, which also takes me back to when Ronald Reagan was president

881129,A65XH6L5BUX0X,B0007IO6V4,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[1, 2]","In the early 1980s, CBS had two nighttime soap operas that were hugely popular in the Nielsen ratings: Dallas was #1 and its spin-off Knots Landing was #22. Jealous ABC was anxious to have their own nighttime serial to compete CBS. To that end, Richard and Esther Shapiro gave ABC a script entitled Oil, about a wealthy oil family living in Denver, Colorado, similar to the Ewings on Dallas. Before the class act went to air, the show became DYNASTY.In the three-part pilot episode, we are introduced to the Carrington family who ""live and sin"" in a 48-room mansion. The family's headed by Blake (John Forsythe), who is about to marry his former secretary, the younger Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans). Krystle is not overly expected into Blake's billion dollar world, and is especially disliked by his snotty majordomo Joseph Anders (Lee Bergere) and his spoiled daughter Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin). Krystle's only ally is her stepson Steven (Al Corley), who has recently revealed his homosexuality, and is quarreling with Blake.These early plots deal with Steven's ""coming out"" and his arguments with Blake; Krystle struggling to be expected by Blake's family; Fallon's affair with Carrington chauffeur, Michael Culhane (Wayne Northrop), to which Blake disapproves; Fallon's dream love being Blake's friend/enemy Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner); Fallon marrying Cecil's nephew Jeff (John James) because of a business deal with Cecil; Steven becoming involved with Ted Dinard (Mark Withers), who Blake kills in episode 11.Playing counterpart to the Carringtons are the Blaisdels; Denver-Carrington geologist Matthew (Bo Hopkins) -- unhappily married to the emotionally fragile Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) -- is Krystle's ex-lover. The Blaisdels daughter Lindsay (Katy Kurtzman) fells unwanted and neglected. Returning from an extended assignment in the Middle East, Matthew quits and goes into business with wildcatter Walter Lankershim (Dale Robertson), and as Blake's behavior begins pushing Krystle toward Matthew, the men are set as both business and romantic rivals.These first 13 episodes that started the Dynasty trend are entertaining. It's a bit campy, but that's Dynasty, from season 1 to season 9. It's direct and a bit more racy than Dallas and especially more ritzy. Season 2 is were this show really gets good, but if you cut these episodes out completely, you'll be lost. This is why ABC added Joan Collins as Alexis Carrington, the scheming, but gorgeous ex-wife of Blake the following season, to spice things up. The ratings were low during this initial year, with Dynasty coming in 38th in the spring of 1981. This is a fair season, but don't be baffled that this what Dynasty was, it isn't.

881130,A25DPNEBMPYU3J,B0007IO6V4,Tom,"[5, 5]","Watching the new box set of 'Dynasty', it's interesting to see how the show started and was designed.  Unlike the salacious camp of later seasons, the first season of Dynasty was saucy and playful, but not outright trashy like some of the later seasons.  With themes like homosexuality, anti-Americanism, depression, class struggles, the early Dynasty actuallly tried to be...dare I say it? - intelligent.The show actually tried to address serious matters yet still deliver solid entertainment.  I also found the characters better written in the early seasons.  Blake was much more mysterious and cunning in the early seasons, and both Al Corley and particularly Pamela Sue Martin (fabulous) were better than their replacements in later seasons.  In fact, I could never imagine anyone else playing Fallon than Emma Samms, but watching Martin, I realize she truly was Fallon.  She was a great nemesis for Krystle before Joan Collins showed up.  Also, the show had incredible set design even from the beginning, and it still looks great today.Also, I hand it to Fox for their presentation of Dynasty.  The show looks great on DVD, unlike the transfer of Dallas which looked dirty and grainy.  Dynasty looks crisp and sleek, but then what would you expect from a show about the richest of the rich?",4,An interesting start,1113004800,"04 9, 2005",2005,1295,"['Watching', 'new', 'box', 'set', ""'Dynasty"", 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'started', 'was', 'designed', 'salacious', 'camp', 'later', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'saucy', 'playful', 'not', 'outright', 'trashy', 'later', 'seasons', 'themes', 'homosexuality', 'anti-Americanism', 'depression', 'class', 'struggles', 'early', 'Dynasty', 'actuallly', 'tried', 'be', 'dare', 'say', 'intelligent.The', 'show', 'actually', 'tried', 'address', 'serious', 'matters', 'yet', 'still', 'deliver', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'also', 'found', 'characters', 'better', 'written', 'early', 'seasons', 'Blake', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'mysterious', 'cunning', 'early', 'seasons', 'Al', 'Corley', 'particularly', 'Pamela', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'fabulous', 'were', 'better', 'replacements', 'later', 'seasons', 'fact', 'could', 'never', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'Fallon', 'Emma', 'Samms', 'watching', 'Martin', 'realize', 'truly', 'was', 'Fallon', 'was', 'great', 'nemesis', 'Krystle', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'showed', 'up', 'Also', 'show', 'had', 'incredible', 'set', 'design', 'even', 'beginning', 'still', 'great', 'today.Also', 'hand', 'Fox', 'presentation', 'Dynasty', 'show', 'great', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'Dallas', 'looked', 'dirty', 'grainy', 'Dynasty', 'crisp', 'sleek', 'then', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'show', 'richest', 'rich']",Dynasty: Season 1

I will admit that The Show didnt hit its stride until the second season when the Character of Alexis was  Introduced BUT The First Season of Dynasty was Still Excellent featuring Srong Writing and Acting! What the First season lacks in Alexis is almost made up by the Delicious and Mischivious Fallon(Played Beautifully By pamela sue martin). fans of the series who didnt watch the first Season would be surprised to know that Blake Carrington(John Forthyte who is perfect for the role) was  actually not that nice of a guy , had a darker side and you can tell that the producers were trying to make him as a JR ewing typr character(you will be happy to know though that blake mellows out in season 2). Krystle(Linda Evans who must be the most beautiful woman in the world) starts out overwhelmed by her sudden life change from secretary to Lady of The Manor and  it is fun to take this journey with her Dynasty was Considered Bold and Brave when they introduced Steven Carrington, son of blake(a sensitive portrayal by Al Corely) as a homosexual, the first openly gay main character in a prime time drama. Al corely  is to be commended for two reasons,, #1 that he took the part when most actors wouldnt, and #2 he portrayed steven as a Gay man but without the swishy steroetypes. What I enjoyed about the first season was the contrasting lifestyles between the Carringtons and the Blaisdales(matthew, claudia and lindsey) and it was intriguing to watch there lives entertwine. I dont want to get into any plot details as not to give anything away, but the first season, even without Alexis was Excellent and should be looked at.

When The Dumb Company knew that the 1st Season would not sell as well without Joan Collins , Without Joan Collins it is Like Dallas without JR. This Boxset contained only 15 episodes which was a dissapointment they should have just Combined Season 1 & 2 which would have jacked the price up a little bit , but They would have sold twice as many copies because Joan  Collins would be in the series.Now we find out Months after Dynasty Season 1 is released , there wont be anymore for a while probley not till 2007 , because in november the rights of The DVD will be tooken over by paramont which accually isnt a horriable thing because if that happens and they start producing The Series on DVD  we will have it out by the end of 2007 because of Paramounts VERY FAST PRODUCTION IN TV ON DVD.

It provided very good episodes for us to get to know each character and get invested in their lives and lifestyle.  Pamela Sue Martin's portrayal as Fallon makes her the best character of the first season, her witty remarks mixed with her snotty attitude you can't help but love her.  The least liked character to me is Krystle, through out the series run she was never a character I could get myself to care about.  In the later seasons I was always rooting for Alexis to destroy Krystle (that's probably why Alexis was my favorite character).  John Forsythe portrays Blake with perfection during this season as a strong and powerful man.  Al Corly is okay as Stephen although I think Jack Coleman portrayed the character better in the later years.

The first season gives you a rich, textured introduction to the Carrington saga and its wealthy but often-empty world, with brutal tycoon Blake (John Forsythe) mistreating his sensitive-but-strong wife, Krystle (then beautifully played by Linda Evans). Season 2, with the arrival of wicked ex-wife Alexis (Joan Collins), is great fun as well, albeit of a somewhat different sort, and the glitz increases.Unfortunately, Krystle did eventually become a wimp: Evans' performance becomes unrecognizable a few seasons into the show, as (and perhaps because) the stories gradually begin to fall apart, with one-plot-after-another-after-another that just went nowhere, the catty dialogue and flashy wardrobe becoming all that remained to sustain the viewer for several years--- or to distract us from what was really happening. (The series' quality only recovering for its final year, season 9, ironically just before it was cancelled).But seasons 1 and 2 are quite good; I only wish ""Dynasty"" had stayed on-track after this.(Technical details: Pretty good visual transfer, though a dirty, scratchy copy of the opening theme is used repeatedly; the sound quality is a bit flat and tinny, without much resonance--- curiously, the French dubbed version on this DVD had much richer sound in terms of music and effects).",4,Before Krystle turned wimp...,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,1410,"['Season', '1', 'Dynasty', 'may', 'have', 'lacked', 'Alexis', 'later', 'lacked', 'Krystle', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'there', 'first', 'season', 'rich', 'textured', 'introduction', 'Carrington', 'saga', 'wealthy', 'often-empty', 'world', 'brutal', 'tycoon', 'Blake', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'mistreating', 'sensitive-but-strong', 'wife', 'Krystle', 'then', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'Season', '2', 'arrival', 'wicked', 'ex-wife', 'Alexis', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'great', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'somewhat', 'different', 'sort', 'glitz', 'increases.Unfortunately', 'Krystle', 'did', 'eventually', 'become', 'wimp', 'Evans', 'performance', 'unrecognizable', 'few', 'seasons', 'show', 'perhaps', 'stories', 'gradually', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart', 'one-plot-after-another-after-another', 'just', 'went', 'nowhere', 'catty', 'dialogue', 'flashy', 'wardrobe', 'becoming', 'remained', 'sustain', 'viewer', 'several', 'years', 'distract', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'series', 'quality', 'only', 'recovering', 'final', 'year', 'season', '9', 'ironically', 'just', 'was', 'cancelled', '.But', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'only', 'wish', 'Dynasty', 'had', 'stayed', 'on-track', 'Technical', 'details', 'Pretty', 'good', 'visual', 'transfer', 'dirty', 'scratchy', 'copy', 'opening', 'theme', 'used', 'repeatedly', 'sound', 'quality', 'bit', 'flat', 'tinny', 'much', 'resonance', 'curiously', 'French', 'dubbed', 'version', 'DVD', 'had', 'much', 'richer', 'sound', 'terms', 'music', 'effects']",Dynasty: Season 1
881135,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B0007IO6V4,William,"[5, 6]","In 1981, Dynasty was released to rival Dallas.  John Forsythe's character of Blake Carrington was intended to be as mean and cruel as JR. Rewatching Season 1 recently, Blake certainly showed this cruel side and it was interesting to see how the show began ie. Krystle's wedding day etc.  Fallon was intended to be the villianess of the show to match the likes of Lucy Ewing, Pamela or even Sue Ellen Elling. I found Season 1 of Dynasty rather dull overall, the storylines were lacking in spark, and the characters just didn't really work. Alot of emphasis was placed on Matthew Blaisdale (Bo Hooper) who's character was not included in Season 2 onwards.  His wife Claudia also received considerable exposure in Season 1 and it seemed that these two characters were intended to be a big part of the show.  Well, no. There is one particular good point about Season 1 - the way they dealt with Stephen's sexuality was quite well handled for the time.  As shown in the special features, very few TV shows back then approached this subject for fear of censorship.Overall Dynasty Season 1 didn't do well in the ratings back in 1981, so it was spiced up for Season 2. Enter Joan Collins who played Blake's first wife Alexis.  This is the when the show really took off.  Joan added the much needed spark and the show's ratings soared.DVD SUMMARY:Season 1 DVD is only 13 episodes so it is not very good value for money when compared with the Dallas Pilot/Season 1 DVD which boasts 26 episodes total for around the same price.  A suggestion then would have been to include Dynasty Season 2 on the same set as Season 1. Afterall, isn't that what we are all really waiting for?Bring on the cat-fights with Krystle and Alexis now.  I will be first in line with my order.",3,Season 1: the empty feeling,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,1757,"['1981', 'Dynasty', 'was', 'released', 'rival', 'Dallas', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'character', 'Blake', 'Carrington', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'mean', 'cruel', 'JR.', 'Rewatching', 'Season', '1', 'recently', 'Blake', 'certainly', 'showed', 'cruel', 'side', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'began', 'ie', 'Krystle', 'wedding', 'day', 'etc', 'Fallon', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'villianess', 'show', 'match', 'likes', 'Lucy', 'Ewing', 'Pamela', 'even', 'Sue', 'Ellen', 'Elling', 'found', 'Season', '1', 'Dynasty', 'rather', 'overall', 'storylines', 'were', 'lacking', 'spark', 'characters', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'Alot', 'emphasis', 'was', 'placed', 'Matthew', 'Blaisdale', 'Bo', 'Hooper', 'who', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'Season', '2', 'onwards', 'wife', 'Claudia', 'also', 'received', 'considerable', 'exposure', 'Season', '1', 'seemed', 'two', 'characters', 'were', 'intended', 'be', 'big', 'part', 'show', 'Well', 'one', 'particular', 'good', 'point', 'Season', '1', 'way', 'dealt', 'Stephen', 'sexuality', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'handled', 'time', 'shown', 'special', 'features', 'very', 'few', 'TV', 'shows', 'back', 'then', 'approached', 'subject', 'fear', 'censorship.Overall', 'Dynasty', 'Season', '1', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'ratings', 'back', '1981', 'was', 'spiced', 'up', 'Season', '2', 'Enter', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'who', 'played', 'Blake', 'first', 'wife', 'Alexis', 'when', 'show', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'Joan', 'added', 'much', 'needed', 'spark', 'show', 'ratings', 'soared.DVD', 'SUMMARY', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'value', 'money', 'when', 'compared', 'Dallas', 'Pilot/Season', '1', 'DVD', '26', 'episodes', 'total', 'same', 'price', 'suggestion', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'include', 'Dynasty', 'Season', '2', 'same', 'set', 'Season', '1', 'Afterall', ""n't"", 'what', 'are', 'really', 'waiting', 'Bring', 'cat-fights', 'Krystle', 'Alexis', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'line', 'order']",Dynasty: Season 1
