I got the dvd and thought the set up of the dvd was big disappointment. The menu is basic scroll of clips and thats about it, well previews of other Comedy Central releases. Its not really the best of the show. Poor selection of clips, whoever picked them. The only saving grace for the dvd is the Better Know a District segements, which is one of the funniest segements in any variety/news show. Still I recommend it to Colbert fans because they love him no matter what.",4,Not really the best of,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,552,"['love', 'Colbert', 'Report', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'release', 'best', 'clips', 'dvd', 'got', 'dvd', 'thought', 'set', 'dvd', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'menu', 'basic', 'scroll', 'clips', 'thats', 'well', 'previews', 'other', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'releases', 'not', 'really', 'best', 'show', 'Poor', 'selection', 'clips', 'whoever', 'picked', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'dvd', 'Better', 'Know', 'District', 'segements', 'one', 'funniest', 'segements', 'variety/news', 'show', 'Still', 'recommend', 'Colbert', 'fans', 'love', 'matter', 'what']",The Best of The Colbert Report

Stephen Colbert, my horse for the long haul 2008 Presidential election--the man who promised--if elected--that he would ""crush the state of Georgia"" because their peaches weren't as good--is not going to be the Democratic nominee from S.C. The reasoning behind the Democratic executive committee, which makes the ultimate decision who can run as a Democrat, was that Colbert wasn't a serious candidate. ""I think this committee that votes took their responsibilities seriously. Our rules are pretty specific about what makes a legitimate candidate,"" a committee member said. Well, excuse me, Miss Committee member! If thousands and thousand of South Caolinigian legal and illegal immigrants want to vote for a joke, what's wrong with that? Remember all the people who voted for Ross Perot? What a joke. I see nothing different from John Edwards' comments about health care and Colbert's comments about peaches.

I figured I'd get around 20-25 dvd's containing every episode ever recorded and then some and for only $14.99 ... who could beat that price.But No!!!  This is only a small glimpse into the first few season of the show.  Mr. Colbert,  this is not a ""Best of"",  what you gave us is called a ""greatest hits"" compilation.The best of your show should begin with the opening sequence of your first ever show  and lasting up to the present day and into the future.  Yes Stephen,  with the purchase of this DVD I was expecting future DVD's to be sent to my house weekly for the remainder of the relevancy of your show,  just so my ""Best of"" set would be constantly up to date and be truly what you so falsely described it.I don't even know what to do with this purchase.  It's like giving a Coke sniffin junkie some over-the-counter nose spray instead of what he most needed (and deserved).
