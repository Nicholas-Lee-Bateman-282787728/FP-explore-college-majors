591218,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKVT,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 13]","If Disney ever wanted to make the argument that they have not lost touch with their childhood roots, I would strongly suggest not mentioning Snow Dogs in that argument.  Sure, the numbers showed that this film was a success (i.e. the budget was $35 million and it took in $81 million in the US alone), but the final product that was released to the screen was nothing but sheer drivel.  From the unoriginal story, to the inconsistent characters, to the painful acting of Cuba Gooding, Jr., Snow Dogs proved two truths.  The first is that Disney can successfully make and mass-produce B-level cinema.  The second is that they can make Oscar-winning actors give the worst performances of their careers.  Snow Dogs demonstrates fully that some people in Hollywood choose money over scripts, they choose flimsy over developed, and recycled over original.  What upset me the most about this film was the use of CGI to exaggerate the dog's expressions.  To me, that is a huge slap in Cuba Gooding, Jr's face.  If the studio didn't think that Cuba could successfully make the audiences laugh, then they needed to get stronger talent, do not muddle the genre with CGI created eyes, mouths, and expressions on the dogs.  With this CGI, I felt as if I was watching a quick fix to an already unfixable problem.Did I go into this film expecting greatness?  Not in any way shape or form.  What I did expect was a level of professionalism topped with some brilliant ""something"" to make me utterly aware that this was a Disney film and while they may have a bad film on their hands, at least they may throw money to fix the problem.  Again, my expectations were demolished.  It became very obvious as I watched this film that half of the scenes were in front of a green screen, not actually in Alaska.  Some of the more emotional moments were completely ruined by the horrid special effects in place.  Disney has the money, where did the $35 million dollar budget go?  From the CGI created dog ""faces"" to the CGI trees, bears, and mountains, you never felt like you were in Alaska at all, but instead warmly comfortable inside an obvious soundstage.  Pay up Disney, you cheated me on this one...For this to be a full review, I have to mention the acting.  It pains me to do so because nobody, I repeat, NOBODY could muster any form of ""reality"" to this film.  From the delivery of the lines, the horrid physical comedy (which never worked), to the random moment of romance, not one character in this movie stayed in character or gave us any semblance of an actual character.  I watched an hour and a half of actors awkwardly demonstrating to us that they did not know their characters, that they did not know their lines, and that the paycheck at the end was more important than the work throughout the process.  I place solely the blame on Cuba Gooding, Jr.  What happened to him?  From the opening scene in Miami to the ending embarrassing ""catch-phrase"", I felt like Cuba should have handed the Academy back the award and apologized to everyone profusely.  There are lines in Snow Dogs that were obviously read from a cue card.  There were moments when it was obvious Cuba didn't care.  He showed no range of emotion, no rational credibility, and again, there was no character.  Who was Cuba Gooding, Jr. in this film?  Just like a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know!  I could easily, and sadly, say the same about James Coburn.  He was awarded an Oscar as well and the best he can manage is Snow Dogs?  Who was Thunder Jack?  What was his story, what made him gruff, what ... what ... what ... just too many questions running through my mind with these key actors that it makes me feel sorry for the child audience this film was aimed towards.  It was very clear that neither of these actors were passionate about the story for they would have stopped early and backed away.  I would have thought that Cuba (or at least James Coburn) would have put their hands down when it was discovered that SISQO (Mr. Thong himself) was going to be a key player.  Unbelievable is the level of lacking respect that both of these actors had for themselves.  The proof is in Snow Dogs.What bothered me the most about this film was the lack of intelligence aimed towards children.  This was a ""family"" film, yet racism seemed to be slapped directly in your face.  There was a scene that sticks out in my mind when Gooding tries to find his real father and assumes that it can only be the other black man in town.  When it is discovered that it is someone else, there is a shock in the community.  This film was released in 2002, with the society that we live in why would this be such a shock to the system?  Couple this with the fact that Michael Bolton brings us the ""inspirational"" line from the film, ""It doesn't matter what color you are, everyone can have soul.""  Egh.  Where did this come from, and is this a ""good"" message to send to children?  This ranks right next to the feeling that Gooding's love-interest was the only woman within a 100-mile radius, and that those living in Alaska are grizzly men with bad teeth.  I felt midway through this film that Disney executives were in their offices insisting on another Cool Runnings-esque film (there was even a Volkswagen moment in this one).  Sadly, with Snow Dogs their request became a nightmare.Overall, this was a cheap film, which boasts Oscar-winners performing well below the bar, CGI dogs and background, a story that hinges on the edge of fantasy, and the quintessential Disney ""bow of approval"".  What I mean by this is that anything can happen, and with Disney films, it will.  Gooding has the finances to leave his dental practice for several weeks without worrying about missing work, he can learn how to dogsled within a couple days, saves a man's life, and he immediately falls in love with the only girl from town who happens to be a model in her spare time.  For those looking for a cute and cuddly film about dogs, I would not suggest this garbage.  It is predictable, pretentious, and pathetic.  Maybe a six-year old wouldn't mind the three ""p"", but this critic hated it!Grade: * out of *****",1,I am not putting any part of that dog in my mouth!,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,6151,"['Disney',

There, he seeks information about his birth mother---who recently died---and comes into a pack of racing huskies. He learns to run the dogs from his birth father Thunder Jack (James Coburn).

Snow Dogs, the movie released from Disney in 2001.This review is from a Christian male 17-year old who has never seen any R-rated movies, and doesn't plan to either, just so you know. If it helps one person decide yes or no on a movie, then it's been worth it. And besides...movie reviewing is fun!PLOT:Ted Brooks (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a successful dentist in rural Miami, with a great job, a nice car, and a great apartment. When he receives a notice that his Mom, his REAL Mom has just passed away in Alaska, and left him an inheritance, his life is shaken up. His kindly adopted mom explains that she had so wanted him to have a normal life that she had never told him about his real mother.So, in the classic tradition of greenhorn-goes-west, Ted catches a plane to Alaska to claim his inheritance. When he finally arrives, he finds Tolketna, a scrawny little town in the wilderness, and the people that knew his Mom, Lucy as one of their ownBarb, the operator of the local watering hole, takes Ted to his mother's rustic cabin, where Ted explores his mother's legacy inside. He gets quite a shock when he discovers seven rambunctious and raucous snow dogs and one mild-mannered border collie staying inside the home.The rest of the movie is classic fun as Ted attempts to learn how to drive his new Snow Dogs, encounters the beautiful winter countryside, and becomes accustomed to his new environment.GOOD POINTS:Ted's mom is a great gal, helping out at his dentist's office and being supportive of Ted's venture into the artic. Ted's devotion to his father in spite of his father's rejection is exemplary, There is no swearing, and the only violence is shown in a comical cartoon-style. This movie is just a light-hearted comedy.BAD POINTS:There aren't many bad points, but what little there is I'm going to list, just in case there are some careful parents out there. Ted, being taught dentistry by his adopted father at a young age, is shown for an instant vomiting after viewing a patient's decaying teeth.Ted is bitten on the behind by Demon, the lead dog, and on another occasion, when Ted mocks the dog, the dog urinates on the tree Ted is in.There are two instances where the movie causes you to think something bad is coming, but veers off in a comical manner. (Examples, Ted encounters a giant grizzly bear, and exclaims ""Oh...oh my GOODNESS GRACIOUS!"" Ted also cuddles with Barb in front of a campfire, and the next scene is Ted awakening in bed. He smiles, and turns to his bed partner, who turns out to be nothing more than the border collie, Nana.A one-night encounter in a cave that led to Ted's birth, is briefly described, but a way that does not focus on the encounter itself, but the events thereafter.In a black-out dream sequence, Ted dreams that, among other things, Barb is talking to him on a beach wearing a bikini, but this quickly fades back to real life. Ted also takes a walk on the beach, and you can see several sunbathers in the background, but nothing is shown or emphasized.THOUGHTS:I have to make this plain to dispel any ideas you may have from previews; the dogs do NOT talk in the movie. If you've seen any previews, that's what you could easily think, but it ain't true.This movie is pure, light-hearted fun, and promises lots of laughs if you buy it. It is a great film family-friendly film for people of all ages. Recommended at seven stars.

But I found it irritating that there was inter-racial humor which would not be accepted if a white person presented it the other way around - a dentist raised by white people who finds out he has a black ancestor, or who is raised in a white community and goes back to his - possibly - New Orleans Haitian roots, to inherit (what?) maybe a place as an ethnic clothing designer, and some rhode island red, voodoo-blessed roosters.What reviewers skip is that Ted is the illigitimate son of a black mother and a white father, which is Thunder Jack. So she gave him up for adoption. This tension is played off and there is a gradual father-son reunion, as Thunder rescues Ted one time, and Ted returns the favor when Thunder goes missing in the big race. Naturally, there is a bad snow storm. Naturally no one else has a desire to brave it to find the musher. Naturally, foster-mom arrives to bid a tearful, worried farewell to her son who goes off to get Thunder.The dogs are good characters in their own right, and the animatronics worked seamlessly, making ""Demon"" really seem like he was plotting against Ted with human intellect.The movie was going well until the cliff-falling-off scene. That was so contrived it spoiled the credibility of the story. I snapped out of the movie and could not get reabsorbed again. The dogs could never have hauled 2 grown men up a cliff with the sled and gear. Deos Ex Machina (act of God) was a bad choice by the script writer.It had a nice family reunion at the finish, and Ted gets his girl, the lovely eskimo-Indian girl, who runs the local pub.

Dr. Ted Brooks, A successful Miami dentist, finds out his mom has died and he must go to Alaska for the hearing of her will. In the will it states he has inherited sled dogs and not wanting to let his mom down he decides to enter in a local race.Before I seen it I thought this plot sounds very silly and it sounds like something only a kid will like. Unfortunately this turns out to be true as the writers forgot to include anyone over the age 13 in on the fun. My 7 year old daughter likes this movie and had seen it a number of times. The screenplay was full of clich&eacute;s and they didn't make them fun either. The movie is very predictable that even kids will be able to see where it's going. It won't matter to them as long as their entertained and it does a decent job at that. Snow Dogs does make an interesting film for kids even if it's pretty generic. It's not worth a second viewing either.The film is 99 minutes long but it feels much longer. There might be chance an adult might like this, however, there's nothing exciting or new here that might guarantee that. Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as Dr. Ted Brooks, why he is in this film remains unclear as he should be picking better roles then this. The late great James Coburn plays Thunder Jack Johnson and sadly this was his last movie.Brian Levant directs and he has made some other family films such as ""Problem Child 2,"" ""The Flintstones"" and ""Are We There Yet?"" Even ""Snow Dogs"" doesn't match up to those films. Maybe I was expecting too much but I thought this was going to be a really good family film. I was wrong as it wasn't very entertaining for me.

I grew angry with the lord and began to question my faith when 3 weeks later he still hadn't delivered, then I saw a report on ET (entertainment Tonight not the alien from the movie of the same name) telling me of this delightful movie being made that featured Sisq&oacute; and Cuba Gooding Jnr, surely it doesn't also feature Michael Bolton I whispered quietly under my breath, at least I thought it was quietly under my breath until the guy standing next to me in the electrical goods store was all like ""quiet I am trying to watch ET"" (interestingly enough he was watching the movie ET which happened to be playing on the TV next to the one I was watching the Entertainment Tonight show on) then ET gave me a glimpse of Michael Bolton! My prayers had been answered and I knew this movie would change my life and be the one thing that would make me feel complete. So I made a calendar (like the Christmas advent ones) counting down the days until the release of Snow Dogs at the Cinemas on January 18 in the year 2002, each day on the calendar had a different picture of Siberian Huskies, however I could only find 3 pictures of Siberian Huskies so instead I just cut out pictures of Huskie men and women to fill out the calendar.6 years later in 2007 I was cleaning out my room because my parents were kicking me out on the streets and while cleaning up I found an elaborate advent calendar with 152 doors to open each one featuring pictures of increasingly fat people, I kicked myself and remembered Snow Dogs and how I had prayed so hard for it yet here I was almost 7 years later and I hadn't seen it, I rushed down to Blockbuster (a popular video store that was operating back in 2007) and out of breath said ""please tell me you have at least one copy of Snow Dogs in"" despite it being such a wildly popular film they had 4 copies in store, I rented 3 of them (I wasn't taking any chances that one might not work) I rushed home and watched it.SNOW DOGS!",4,Michael Bolton is in this movie (so is Sisq&oacute; who sung the thong song),1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,2127,"['one', 'day', '2001', 'was', 'praying', 'hard', 'do', 'day', 'asked', 'lord', 'can', 'bring', 'Sisq', 'oacute', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'same', 'place', 'grew', 'angry', 'lord', 'began', 'question', 'faith', 'when', '3', 'weeks', 'later', 'still', 'had', ""n't"", 'delivered', 'then', 'saw', 'report', 'ET', 'entertainment', 'Tonight', 'not', 'alien', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'telling', 'delightful', 'movie', 'being', 'made', 'featured', 'Sisq', 'oacute', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jnr', 'surely', ""n't"", 'also', 'feature', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'whispered', 'quietly', 'breath', 'least', 'thought', 'was', 'quietly', 'breath', 'guy', 'standing', 'next', 'electrical', 'goods', 'store', 'was', 'quiet', 'am', 'trying', 'watch', 'ET', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'ET', 'happened', 'be', 'playing', 'TV', 'one', 'was', 'watching', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight', 'show', 'then', 'ET', 'gave', 'glimpse', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'prayers', 'had', 'been', 'answered', 'knew', 'movie', 'would', 'change', 'life', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'make', 'feel', 'complete', 'made', 'calendar', 'Christmas', 'advent', 'ones', 'counting', 'down', 'days', 'release', 'Snow', 'Dogs', 'Cinemas', 'January', '18', 'year', '2002', 'day', 'calendar', 'had', 'different', 'picture', 'Siberian', 'Huskies', 'however', 'could', 'only', 'find', '3', 'pictures', 'Siberian', 'Huskies', 'instead', 'just', 'cut', 'out', 'pictures', 'Huskie', 'men', 'women', 'fill', 'out', 'calendar.6', 'years', 'later', '2007', 'was', 'cleaning', 'out', 'room', 'parents', 'were', 'kicking', 'streets', 'cleaning', 'up', 'found', 'elaborate', 'advent', 'calendar', '152', 'doors', 'open', 'one', 'featuring', 'pictures', 'increasingly', 'fat', 'people', 'kicked', 'remembered', 'Snow', 'Dogs', 'how', 'had', 'prayed', 'so', 'hard', 'yet', 'here', 'was', 'almost', '7', 'years', 'later', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'rushed', 'down', 'Blockbuster', 'popular', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'operating', 'back', '2007', 'breath', 'said', 'please', 'tell', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'copy', 'Snow', 'Dogs', 'being', 'such', 'wildly', 'popular', 'film', 'had', '4', 'copies', 'store', 'rented', '3', 'was', ""n't"", 'taking', 'chances', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'work', 'rushed', 'home', 'watched', 'it.SNOW', 'DOGS']",Snow Dogs VHS

As it turns out, the part about the dogs talking was in one scene and that was a dream sequence. So having watched an hilarious trailer I had really high hopes for this movie. As the movie reached the 45 minute mark, and the dogs still hadn't said anything, I was beginning to think it was just me. However it wasn't and boy was I disappointed.Still, not to be too harsh I sat back and accepted the movie for what it was. And I did indeed find it funny in places. Cuba Googing, Jr was on fine form. I also really enjoyed the pretty exciting ending which featured appropriately rousing music. It had an ending reminiscent of a Mighty Ducks movie or &quot;Cool Runnings&quot;, and helped to improve my overall view of &quot;Snow Dogs&quot;.The version I saw in the UK was a widescreen version and looked great and so I would have given it 4 stars out of kindness. However the U.S. version is in full screen format which I'd be very disappointed in indeed. It might be interesting to note that many full screen Disney releases are being released in widescreen in the UK, and so if there is a movie that you really treasure that is only available in widescreen in the U.S. it might be worth waiting a little longer.The special features are fine but nothing special. And I'm not sure, but the director whether being interviewed or speaking on the commentary, always seems to be high.

Such is the case with ""Snow Dogs,"" a funny movie with a truly all-star cast that keeps the spirit of the Disney of old while giving us modern entertainment.Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays dentist Ted Brooks.  Ted is more than just a dentist; he has a huge practice in sunny Miami, apparently quite wealthy, a true man of the city, until a summons arrives one day informing him that his mother has died.  One small detail, his mother, Nichelle Nichols of the original ""Star Trek"" series and movies fame, had neglected to tell Ted that she was his adoptive mother.  Ted's biological mother lived in the wide-spot-in-the-valley of Tolketna, Alaska.  Isolated does not describe Tolketna, which appears to be reached only by helicopter or airplane, and even those must be small.Ted's mother turns out to have been a very nice lady, with a penchant for sled dog racing.  Lucky Ted, he not only inherits the bulk of his mother's possessions, he also inherits a team of potentially prize-winning sled dogs.  If only Ted did not hate dogs.In the course of discovering that small-town life is infinitely more appealing than living shoulder-to-shoulder with your neighbors, Ted also discovers a lot about himself and about life in general.  He discovers his father and discovers true love in the cold and snow of mythical Tolketna.  During this voyage of discovery we gain an appreciation for the beauty of the far north, lots of laughs, and several tense moments, including one where Ted Brooks and Thunder Jack Johnson (James Coburn) are hanging suspended over a cliff, hoping the sled dogs can pull them to safety.Superb family movies seem to be hard to come by these days.  This movie is excellent and a family movie.  The violence is minimal, the tense moments generally work out well, there are lessons regarding perseverance, and there are dogs that have more expressions than Mr. Spock.  While I often caution parents that some portions of a movie may be a bit too tense for younger members of the family, that caution is unnecessary for this PG rated movie.  Admittedly there are several moments of very mild violence, but those moments I found to be less than that in other family movies, such as ""The Wizard of Oz.""With the combination of scenery, a reasonably plausible plot, excellent cast, and frequent funny moments, this movie is a great movie for everyone.

Bryan Levant directed this film and you can tell because it does have that Flintstones quality to it. The whole family should like this movie. It's cute and has lots of furry dogs with incredible eyes. The only thing that bugged me a little is that Bryan is obnoxious in his commentary. He is very loud and sometimes annoying. Where the duel commentary with producer Jorden is much more calmer to listen to.Cuba Gooding Jr. stars in this feature and I must say he is really a good physical actor. As you know, his Academy Award for Jerry McGuire proves he is a extremely gifted comedic actor, but in this movie not only is he funny, but he has great athletic bits as well.The movie is about a Miami dentist who inherits a team of Snow Dogs that race every year in an Alaskan competition. There are some really great performances by Graham Green and the ever-ominous James Coburn as the bad guy. He is actually got a secret that Cuba doesn't know about. Once he decides to the dogs up north something happens that changes his mind and makes him enter the Mush races as well.My favorite performance in this film is by far Nichelle Nichols. She is funny, elegant and very charming. She plays the concerned and overly conscious mother like no one I have seen. As you know, she is better known for her role as Commander Uhura in the Star Trek series and feature films.The extras include some funny deleted scenes, the commentary and a DVD game where you have to ride a snowmobile. Its kind of fun. And very entertaining. Like I said this movie was a much more pleasant surprise than I expected and Nichelle steals the scene while Cuba does hold the film together.

A little harsh; SNOW DOGS works not because of Cuba; it works because it's hearts in the right place and the dogs are a pleasure to watch, especially Demon and Nana.  There is one hilarious dream sequence where the dogs are sunning themselves on the beach, in lounge chairs, sunglasses and drinks in hand.  Cuba does better once he gets over the prat-falling sequences early in the movies; Gooding comes nowhere near the masters of this:  Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, Dick van Dyke and Jerry Lewis.  But once Gooding stops trying to be these guys, his performance settles down, and he avoids killing the movie.  Also, James Coburn is delightful as his ""father"", and Nichelle Nichols is even more beautiful than she was in ""Star Trek.""

Dr. Ted Brooks (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) has a successful practice, ""Hot Smile,"" when one day his mother drops the news that he was adopted.

It's lighter in tone but still provides some thrilling moments against a spectacular Alaskan backdrop. (They could have capitalized on the scenery even more.)  The laughs come naturally in this script, as a Southern city slicker thrust into the Alaskan wilderness is bound to run into goofy situations.

There are a lot of people making social judgements about the characters and I think they miss the whole point of the film. Disney set out to make a funny movie about a Miami dentist.

The movie is about a man that is transported to an enviroment completly different for the comfort that he enjoyed in Miami.

It's the story of a Miami dentist who, through a woman's will, becomes the owner of a house in (seemingly fictional) Alaskan town of Talkeetna, where he meets the house's current residents, a group of seven Siberian Huskies, the woman's sled dog team.  The dentist tries to find out how to deal with the dogs while trying to learn about his past and this woman's connection to him, all while the region's second biggest sled dog race is coming up.  I will admit that I really liked this film's theme music and I'm looking for a soundtrack to buy.

There is a brief dream sequence with Cuba Gooding freezing and hallucinating about the dogs talking to him. The dream bit is entertaining, but the film is not a fantasy. Well, lets just say it is Hollywood's version of reality.Cuba Gooding is his usual appealing self and James Coburn as Thunder Jack reminds us of why he was a popular star. Cuba Gooding plays a successful dentist in Florida who discovers he was adopted. His biological mother in Alaska has died and left him . . guess what? The dogs, of course. He sets off to visit Alaska and find his true self. The funniest scenes are when Cuba is learning to handle the dogs and drive a dog sled team. This is an ideal movie to watch with the kids. Mine laughed at the right places and were quiet in the right places. They gave it five stars. I am sure they will convince me to watch it with them again in a month or two.

Then, after renting it 3 times, I almost rented it a 4th time, but, after I told the check-out gal that this was my 4th time renting it, she asked me, ""Well, do you want to buy it?"" and I said ""Sure!"" Then, when it came out on DVD, I bought a previously-viewed copy of it from the same video rental store. I love Snow Dogs for lots of reasons: the cast, which includes Cuba Gooding, Jr., the late James Coburn, Joanna Bacalso, Nichelle Nichols, Brian Doyle-Murray (brother of Bill Murray), etc., the plot, in which dentist Ted Brooks (Gooding, Jr.), who hates dogs, finds out that he's adopted, he travels from his home, in Miami, Florida, to Tolketna, Alaska for the reading of the last will & testament of his birth mother, a sled-dog racer, who's just passed away and left him her team of sled dogs, plus her border collie, Nana. But, Ted faces challenges like a crusty, old mountain man named Thunder Jack (Coburn)who wants the sled dogs for the Arctic Challenge sled-dog race, which is similar to the Iditarod. So, Ted trains himself to be a musher. I also like the names of the sled dogs like Yodel, Sniff, Demon, etc., the dialogue especially when Barb (Bacalso) & Ted are on a mountain & she tells him, ""Maybe you need to finish what you started."", because that's a phrase that I live by, and the funny parts, like when Ted's teaching himself how to ride a dog-sled. This movie is hilarious, and I recommend it to anyone who likes Cuba Gooding, Jr., comedy movies, or any kind of movies, in general, because, believe me, this movie is GREAT!",5,"It's time to get ready for Mush Hour!,",1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,1667,"['discovered', 'extremely', 'funny', 'movie', 'local', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'available', 'video', 'cassette', 'Then', 'renting', '3', 'times', 'almost', 'rented', '4th', 'time', 'told', 'check-out', 'gal', 'was', '4th', 'time', 'renting', 'asked', 'Well', 'do', 'want', 'buy', 'said', 'Sure', 'Then', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'bought', 'previously-viewed', 'copy', 'same', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'love', 'Snow', 'Dogs', 'lots', 'reasons', 'cast', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'late', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Joanna', 'Bacalso', 'Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'Brian', 'Doyle-Murray', 'brother', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'etc.', 'plot', 'dentist', 'Ted', 'Brooks', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'who', 'dogs', 'out', 'adopted', 'home', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'Tolketna', 'Alaska', 'reading', 'last', 'will', 'testament', 'birth', 'mother', 'sled-dog', 'racer', 'who', 'just', 'passed', 'away', 'left', 'team', 'sled', 'dogs', 'border', 'collie', 'Nana', 'Ted', 'challenges', 'crusty', 'old', 'mountain', 'man', 'named', 'Thunder', 'Jack', 'Coburn', 'who', 'sled', 'dogs', 'Arctic', 'Challenge', 'sled-dog', 'race', 'similar', 'Iditarod', 'So', 'Ted', 'be', 'musher', 'also', 'names', 'sled', 'dogs', 'Yodel', 'Sniff', 'Demon', 'etc.', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'when', 'Barb', 'Bacalso', 'Ted', 'are', 'mountain', 'Maybe', 'need', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'phrase', 'live', 'funny', 'parts', 'when', 'Ted', 'teaching', 'how', 'ride', 'dog-sled', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'comedy', 'movies', 'kind', 'movies', 'general', 'believe', 'movie', 'GREAT']",Snow Dogs VHS
591290,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JKVT,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","In the dishearteningly mediocre ""Snow Dogs,"" Oscar-winner Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a Miami dentist who inherits an Alaskan dogsled team from a mother he never knew he had.Perhaps to compensate for the bland inexpressiveness of the canines themselves, Gooding Jr. prances, preens and mugs for the camera in a vain attempt to bring some badly needed life to the proceedings.  Indeed, the dogs are so lacking in personality and character that they become little more than bit players in their own movie.  For some inexplicable reason, the creaky Jim Kouf screenplay concentrates almost exclusively on the dull plot mechanics involving a young man's attempts to come to terms with the various adults in his life - particularly his derelict father played by yet another Oscar-winner, James Coburn.  Of what possible interest this could be to the target audience of the film - 5 to 10 year olds - I find it impossible to fathom.  With so little attention paid to the dogs in the film, even the least demanding viewer will quickly find himself bored, restless and disappointed.There seems to be an unwritten rule among adult critics that states that children's films are not to be held to the same standard as adult films, that somehow one needs to qualify one's criticism with the understanding that children do not judge movies by the same terms adults do.  Yet does one feel the need to qualify one's praise of ""The Wizard of Oz""? Of ""Mary Poppins""? Of ""E.T. - The Extraterrestrial""?  Certainly not, for any great film that can be enjoyed by children can be enjoyed by adults as well.Sad to say, ""Snow Dogs"" is a movie that neither children nor adults will take much pleasure in.",2,not much fun for children or adults,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,1673,"['dishearteningly', 'mediocre', 'Snow', 'Dogs', 'Oscar-winner', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Miami', 'dentist', 'who', 'Alaskan', 'dogsled', 'team', 'mother', 'never', 'knew', 'compensate', 'bland', 'inexpressiveness', 'canines', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'prances', 'preens', 'mugs', 'camera', 'vain', 'attempt', 'bring', 'badly', 'needed', 'life', 'proceedings', 'Indeed', 'dogs', 'are', 'so', 'lacking', 'personality', 'character', 'become', 'little', 'more', 'bit', 'players', 'own', 'movie', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'creaky', 'Jim', 'Kouf', 'screenplay', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'dull', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'involving', 'young', 'man', 'attempts', 'come', 'terms', 'various', 'adults', 'life', 'particularly', 'derelict', 'father', 'played', 'yet', 'Oscar-winner', 'James', 'Coburn', 'what', 'possible', 'interest', 'could', 'be', 'target', 'audience', 'film', '5', '10', 'year', 'find', 'impossible', 'fathom', 'so', 'little', 'attention', 'paid', 'dogs', 'film', 'even', 'least', 'demanding', 'viewer', 'will', 'quickly', 'find', 'bored', 'restless', 'disappointed.There', 'be', 'unwritten', 'rule', 'adult', 'critics', 'children', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'held', 'same', 'standard', 'adult', 'films', 'somehow', 'one', 'qualify', 'one', 'criticism', 'understanding', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'judge', 'movies', 'same', 'terms', 'adults', 'do', 'one', 'feel', 'need', 'qualify', 'one', 'praise', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'E.T', 'Extraterrestrial', 'Certainly', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'adults', 'well.Sad', 'say', 'Snow', 'Dogs', 'movie', 'children', 'adults', 'will', 'take', 'much', 'pleasure']",Snow Dogs VHS

From the previews of this film I had assumed this movie was about dogs who could talk (ala Babe). I'm sorry to say,  its not. The dogs only talk in one (particularly funny) dream sequence.When Miami dentist Ted Brooks learns, that he is adopted, he is summoned to the distant North for the reading of his will. In Alaska,  Ted learns some surprising facts about his TRUE parentage. Ted's mother was a sled dog racer, had a mysterious lover, and owns a beautiful piece of property in Alaska, and a horde of  aggressive sled dogs. As Ted tries to explore the past, he becomes sucked into his birth-mother's world, and develops a romantic interest in lovely bartender/innkeeper Barb (Joana Basco).I thought this movie was a light funny comedy,  with some good acting by Cuba Gooding, James Coburn, and Nichelle Nichols. The scenery was beautiful, and cgi special effects were great.What I didn't like about the film is it enforced the idea that ""rural live is good, city life is bad,"" and ""city people are incompetent materialistic morons"" (which is a stereotype that has been done to death in recent films). There was also an unfunny slapstick scene where  Ted was trapped on the ice, and fell in,  that raised the hair on the back of my neck.

Dr. Brooks is a dentist with a wonderful dental practice in Miami.  He finds out he has to go to Alaska, and his mother has to finally reveal a secret that will turn his world upside down.  He finds out he was adopted, and going to Alaska he will learn about his true birth mother, but he also finds out about his birth father.  Ted finds out he inherits some snow race dogs, which he is not thrilled with.  Ted HATES dogs with a passion.  Well it turns out the dogs don't like him much either, and that's when the fun really begins!As anxious as he is to return to Miami, he finds himself starting to appreciate the low key town, but he is especially drawn to Barb (Joanna Balcaso - My Baby Daddy).  Ted wants to prove he hang so he tries to learn the sport, and again you get a ton of laughs as he tries to control the dogs.  I'm not a dog lover, but even I could not help but fall in love with the canine stars in this film.  Especially Demon and Nana.  The dream sequence is quite enjoyable.  James Coburn is wonderful as Thunder Jack the ""father"", and he keeps harassing Ted into giving him the dogs.  Nichelle Nicholos was simply GORGEOUS in this film.  Just stunning!!!Some of the funnier moments in the film:1.  Teds first encounter with the dogs will leave you in tears because you will be laughing so hard.2.  Ted trying to get the dogs to Mush, and the dogs taking him on a wild, wild ride.Please ignore the reviews that trash this film.  This is a film that will leave you with that feel good feeling when it's all over!!  This is a film for the whole family to sit down together and enjoy. I enjoyed this movie so much, I plan to add it to my collection.

Many of the children I worked with at the preschool had seen it and told me it was a ""really good movie"". My family saw it and told me I would probably like it. However, every critical review I read panned the film and against my better judgement, I listened to the critics.  I should know better than that by now.Sure, the movie is full of stereotypes (big city ones, rural life ones, Canadian ones, Miami ones). Sure there are a few low humor jokes. Sure, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and James Coburn are great actors and could have made ""much better pictures"", but maybe they didn't want to. Maybe they read this script, thought it would be fun and would be something nice to do for, oh I don't know, kids and their families.I laughed my head off at several spots throughout this movie. Yet, though it is a comedy, SNOW DOGS is much more. It's a coming of age tale. It's a story about a man's quest for his past. It's a film that takes a look at what living is really about.The film is aimed at children. Surprisingly, it looks at some pretty heavy issues: bi-racial relationships and adoption. Most people don't even recognize that.
