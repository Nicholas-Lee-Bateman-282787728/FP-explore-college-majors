It was also a treat to see Alison Arngrim who played ""Nellie Oleson"" on the legendary series ""Little House on the Prairie"".I would give this movie 5 stars except for one problem.  To be totally honest, the comments and demeanor of Gunn's parents, Anya and Sven (played by Kelly Keaton and Derek Long) are rather nauseating throughout the film.  Anya is an airhead whose incessant giggling and verbal diarrhea are extremely irritating, and Sven is a burnt out pothead whose moronic utterances render his character virtually insufferable.Nevertheless, they are harmless characters with a zest for life, especially in contrast to Nathan's parents who seem so cold and distant towards him, and I found them much more redeeming by the end of the film.Watching this film along with ""Scrooge and Marley"" and ""Regarding Billy"" will be new annual holiday treat at my house.",4,An Entertaining Holiday Treat,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,1143,"['Overall', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'cute', 'young', 'couple', ""'Gunn"", 'made', 'smile.I', 'was', 'delighted', 'festive', 'holiday', 'music', 'much', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'decorations', 'celebratory', 'activities', 'characters', 'were', 'engaged', 'was', 'also', 'treat', 'see', 'Alison', 'Arngrim', 'who', 'played', 'Nellie', 'Oleson', 'legendary', 'series', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', '.I', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'problem', 'be', 'totally', 'honest', 'comments', 'demeanor', 'Gunn', 'parents', 'Anya', 'Sven', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Keaton', 'Derek', 'Long', 'are', 'rather', 'nauseating', 'film', 'Anya', 'airhead', 'incessant', 'giggling', 'verbal', 'diarrhea', 'are', 'extremely', 'irritating', 'Sven', 'burnt', 'out', 'pothead', 'moronic', 'utterances', 'render', 'character', 'virtually', 'insufferable.Nevertheless', 'are', 'harmless', 'characters', 'zest', 'life', 'especially', 'contrast', 'Nathan', 'parents', 'who', 'seem', 'so', 'cold', 'distant', 'towards', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'redeeming', 'end', 'film.Watching', 'film', 'Scrooge', 'Marley', 'Regarding', 'Billy', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'annual', 'holiday', 'treat', 'house']",Make The Yuletide Gay

I have yet to see a bad movie made by them.  Anyway, I kind of hate to admit the fact that I loved this movie so much, I watched it at least 2 maybe 3 times a day since Thanksgiving.In fact I had to just order another copy, because mine is starting to wear out.The acting is excellent, Derek Long is great, he made this right after 3 Day Weekend, and to see the contrast between the two parts shows what a great actor he is, And he is H.O.T.  Kelly Keaton is a laugh a minute, although she does tend to step on others lines and she is not that old, but she is silly.  Alison Arngrim is great as the bitchy neighbor, but she can be a bit of a Nellie.Gates Mcfadden and Ian Buchanan are wonderful as the wealthy parents who go on a Christmas Cruise without their son, because there just weren't any other cabins available.  Halee Hirsh shows what a fine young actress she is going from Miss Prim and Proper to Gay boy's best friend, air kisses.Adamo Ruggiero and Keith Jordan really have chemistry.  They actually look as if they are in love.What I do like, which some didn't is all the double inuendos.  The film is filled with them and they are really funny.

1282836,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B002PCVLWW,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[38, 40]","The college dorm's resident ""out and proud"" gay couple, Olaf (""Gunn"") and Nathan, are going home to spend Christmas with their respective families, and those families couldn't be more different. Whereas ""trust fund baby"" Nathan's parents are rather cold, status-seeking yuppies, Olaf's parents are a couple of former hippies who start decorating their home for the holidays months before.  When Nathan's parents stand him up to go on a holiday cruise, he decides to surprise Olaf by joining him at his parents, only to find out that his parents have no clue that he is gay.  Nathan immediately tries to ""butch it up"" a bit, but is disappointed and hurt that Olaf is unable - more like unwilling - to introduce him as his boyfriend.A sweet and engaging, though somewhat corny, story about honesty, self-acceptance and - ultimately - the meaning of love.  Newcomer Keith Jordan does a first-rate job as the emotionally conflicted Olaf, and is surrounded by an excellent cast of veteran character actors, including Derek Long (""3-Day Weekend"" and several other gay films) as Olaf's stoner dad, actress/voiceover artist Kelly Keaton as his jolly mother, Hallee Hirsh (who played Dr. Greene's daughter on ""ER"") as Olaf's supposed girlfriend Abby, Alison Arngrin (best know as Nellie Olsen on ""Little House on the Prairie"") as Abby's mom, Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher on ""Star Trek: TNG"") as Nathan's mom, and Adamo Ruggiero (Marco for five seasons on ""Degrassi: The Next Generation"") as Nathan. The direction and technical aspects seem flawless, and there are even a half dozen or so original songs on the soundtrack. DVD isn't rated, but would likely be PG; definitely a film you could (and should) share with your parents and younger siblings.  Popular at several gay film festivals, and in a limited theatrical run, this just might become a timeless gay holiday classic.

1282847,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B002PCVLWW,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","A sweet or really fabulous film on coming out; not in the world which is college for the two boys (That was done a long time ago and everyone knows about it), but in their families. On one side Olaf has to reveal his parents he is gay, on the other side Nathan has to reveal his family he has a boy friend. Both are hard, both situations and probably both boys too. One has to be done face to face. The other has to be done on an answering machine that will only be listened to three weeks later.But the film is not only fabulous because of these last five minutes but because all along it is innuendo upon innuendo and it never ends. We believe up to those last five minutes that it is pure innocence if not simple-mindedness on Olaf's parents' side, but it is true there is some humour when people who play straight 100% start telling you that ""If you put enough meat in a man's mouth, he is happy"". And there is also some humour when the two boys confronted with sharing the same room and bunk beds the one like the other both pretend that they both like to be on top, and the poor mother does not seem to catch the very direct meaning.The best part is not about the film. It is about the quotes from this film given by cinema sites: I have not found one single of these funny remarks that are funny because of their double-entendre. Why on earth are some people shy about it, even when it does not concern them directly? I wonder. That is not modesty at all but guilt somewhere, and probably rejection.The film is probably not going to revolutionize our way of looking at gay people coming out of the famous closet, and it is probably not that simple and easy to do. But it is a funny film that reveals how two men can really love each other just because they love each other and there is no explanation for love. It is just beautiful and hot, indeed, burning hot. ""All you need is love!"" Quoted in the film.And even if it is true we are always amazed how well most people are able to accept love, no matter what kind of love it is because there are always a few who will become brutal and aggressive just for the fun and the anger of blowing up a gay man.I cannot understand why so many people can only see that love can only be straight, whereas love can be mental, artistic, musical, sentimental, passionate, gay, straight or LGBT. And there is no obligation for that love to be hormonal at all. We can, we must, we should love many people for all types of reason and in all types of way, each form of love reinforcing all other forms. Just loving another person is the most beautiful thing in the world and the phenomenal transformation it operates in one's mind and way of looking at the world is a good enough reason to accept and even worship every and any form of love.And a love affair can always be carried out to its acme between two sheets of paper in a book, or two prints from the 18th century or two blankets of silky thinking on the latest physical discovery about how protons, neutrinos, electrons, and so many other photons can spend their whole life chasing one another and yet never meeting and having any kind of a direct physical encounter.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Gay is hot and the closet is lukewarm,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,3187,"['sweet', 'really', 'fabulous', 'film', 'coming', 'out', 'not', 'world', 'college', 'two', 'boys', 'was', 'done', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'everyone', 'families', 'one', 'side', 'Olaf', 'reveal', 'parents', 'gay', 'other', 'side', 'Nathan', 'reveal', 'family', 'boy', 'friend', 'are', 'hard', 'situations', 'probably', 'boys', 'too', 'One', 'be', 'done', 'face', 'face', 'other', 'be', 'done', 'answering', 'machine', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'listened', 'three', 'weeks', 'later.But', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'fabulous', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'innuendo', 'innuendo', 'never', 'believe', 'up', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'pure', 'innocence', 'not', 'simple-mindedness', 'Olaf', 'parents', 'side', 'true', 'humour', 'when', 'people', 'who', 'play', 'straight', '100', '%', 'start', 'telling', 'put', 'enough', 'meat', 'man', 'mouth', 'happy', 'also', 'humour', 'when', 'two', 'boys', 'confronted', 'sharing', 'same', 'room', 'bunk', 'one', 'other', 'pretend', 'be', 'top', 'poor', 'mother', 'not', 'seem', 'catch', 'very', 'direct', 'meaning.The', 'best', 'part', 'not', 'film', 'quotes', 'film', 'given', 'cinema', 'sites', 'have', 'not', 'found', 'one', 'single', 'funny', 'remarks', 'are', 'funny', 'double-entendre', 'Why', 'earth', 'are', 'people', 'shy', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'concern', 'directly', 'wonder', 'not', 'modesty', 'guilt', 'somewhere', 'probably', 'rejection.The', 'film', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'revolutionize', 'way', 'looking', 'gay', 'people', 'coming', 'famous', 'closet', 'probably', 'not', 'simple', 'easy', 'do', 'funny', 'film', 'how', 'two', 'men', 'can', 'really', 'love', 'other', 'just', 'love', 'other', 'explanation', 'love', 'just', 'beautiful', 'hot', 'indeed', 'burning', 'hot', 'need', 'love', 'Quoted', 'film.And', 'even', 'true', 'are', 'always', 'amazed', 'how', 'well', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'accept', 'love', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'love', 'are', 'always', 'few', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'brutal', 'aggressive', 'just', 'fun', 'anger', 'blowing', 'up', 'gay', 'man.I', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'love', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'straight', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'mental', 'artistic', 'musical', 'sentimental', 'passionate', 'gay', 'straight', 'LGBT', 'obligation', 'love', 'be', 'hormonal', 'can', 'must', 'should', 'love', 'many', 'people', 'types', 'reason', 'types', 'way', 'form', 'love', 'reinforcing', 'other', 'forms', 'Just', 'loving', 'person', 'most', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'world', 'phenomenal', 'transformation', 'one', 'mind', 'way', 'looking', 'world', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'accept', 'even', 'worship', 'form', 'love.And', 'love', 'affair', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'carried', 'acme', 'two', 'sheets', 'paper', 'book', 'two', 'prints', '18th', 'century', 'two', 'blankets', 'silky', 'thinking', 'latest', 'physical', 'discovery', 'how', 'protons', 'neutrinos', 'electrons', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'photons', 'can', 'spend', 'whole', 'life', 'chasing', 'one', 'yet', 'never', 'meeting', 'having', 'kind', 'direct', 'physical', 'encounter.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Make The Yuletide Gay

1282850,A2CSEAGXAPQ0Z4,B002PCVLWW,James S.,"[10, 11]","Sometimes sweetness and innocence are enough.  A movie doesn't have to be the best, the most technically assured, when the characters that inhabit it are filled with genuine goodness.  Among the dreck of most gay cinema, it's an unexpected surprise to find a movie that rests on the laurels of simple affection and succeeds.The premise is simple enough: Olaf is a college senior.  While he's freely out on campus, things are different at the Gunnunderson (yes, Gunnunderson) household.  Olaf goes home to visit his wacky parents, and is shocked when his boyfriend, Nathan, having been ditched by his cold-hearted parents, shows up on the doorstep.  Olaf isn't out, of course, so he introduces Nathan as his ""roommate.""  The film follows Olaf as he struggles to tell his parents who he truly is, and Nathan, who isn't at all comfortable being shoved back in the closet.I've read some reviews criticizing the film's over-the-top characters and sometimes awkward dialogue.  But you know what?  ""Make the Yuletide Gay"" has such a joyous spirit that none of those things matter.  Cynicism isn't wanted here.  Olaf and Nathan (played charmingly by Keith Jordan and Adamo Ruggiero) have true, genuine affection for one another.  Olaf's parents, while not necessarily realistic, are filled with love and, knowing that Nathan has been dumped by his parents, take him and treat him like one of their own.  And the most miraculous part of the film?  It's practically devoid of negative gay stereotypes.  No drugs.  No random sex (save for one hilariously interrupted intimate moment).  And when the drama comes, it isn't born of archetypes, but of two characters, deeply in love, who can't bear to watch each other suffer.This is a sweet movie, a hidden gem.",4,Unexpected,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1747,"['Sometimes', 'sweetness', 'innocence', 'are', 'enough', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'best', 'most', 'technically', 'assured', 'when', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'are', 'filled', 'genuine', 'goodness', 'dreck', 'most', 'gay', 'cinema', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'find', 'movie', 'laurels', 'simple', 'affection', 'succeeds.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'enough', 'Olaf', 'college', 'senior', 'freely', 'out', 'campus', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'Gunnunderson', 'yes', 'Gunnunderson', 'household', 'Olaf', 'home', 'visit', 'wacky', 'parents', 'shocked', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'Nathan', 'having', 'been', 'ditched', 'cold-hearted', 'parents', 'up', 'doorstep', 'Olaf', ""n't"", 'out', 'course', 'roommate', 'film', 'Olaf', 'tell', 'parents', 'who', 'truly', 'Nathan', 'who', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'being', 'shoved', 'back', 'closet.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'criticizing', 'film', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'know', 'what', 'Make', 'Yuletide', 'Gay', 'joyous', 'spirit', 'none', 'things', 'matter', 'Cynicism', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'here', 'Olaf', 'Nathan', 'played', 'charmingly', 'Keith', 'Jordan', 'Adamo', 'Ruggiero', 'have', 'true', 'genuine', 'affection', 'one', 'Olaf', 'parents', 'not', 'necessarily', 'realistic', 'are', 'filled', 'love', 'knowing', 'Nathan', 'been', 'dumped', 'parents', 'take', 'treat', 'one', 'own', 'most', 'miraculous', 'part', 'film', 'practically', 'devoid', 'negative', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'drugs', 'random', 'sex', 'save', 'one', 'hilariously', 'interrupted', 'intimate', 'moment', 'when', 'drama', ""n't"", 'born', 'archetypes', 'two', 'characters', 'deeply', 'love', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'watch', 'other', 'suffer.This', 'sweet', 'movie', 'hidden', 'gem']",Make The Yuletide Gay

1282854,AMWIK6JOWNTHK,B002PCVLWW,Kurt Clare,"[1, 6]","Some have described this as a 'feel good' movie, which in my opinion amounts to nothing more than accepting the average. Look it is not terrible, but is far from the hype afforded to it in both promotional material and these reviews. Gunn whilst convincing in his portrayal of a closeted 'jock' is a little stoic and at times seemed removed from what is happening around him. Whilst unsure of his parents reaction to him being gay, and somewhat terrified at the thought of loosing them should they react badly, he seems somewhat unaffected emotionally. In fact, the only time he shows any real emotion is when his boyfriend Nathan arrives unexpected at his childhood home to celebrate Christmas with him. I found the very nature of his reaction (being closeted) to be arbitrary, particularly in the face of Nathan's open flamboyance. Any reasonable person would have certainly raised eyebrows and been a little suspicious. In short the acting was okay, but the script (more accurately dialogue between characters) was trivial as if they were not entirely sure of what they had to portray. The actors did not seem to fit, but for the rather eccentric parents.What I did like was the alter story, between Nathan and his 'girlfriend' aka the girl next door. Ultimately both characters, one straight and one gay, both portrayed ulterior versions of themselves to both society and their parents. The perverse irony being that 'closeted' personalities or sexuality what ever that may be, is not unique to the gay community. This could have been explored better, as I found the humour to be witty, dynamic and new. This was also true of the scathing sarcasm that existed between her and his mother, which at times had me replaying the conversation so that I did not miss the 'furious' exchanges.In summary, the movie was painfully average. At times it was badly acted, with serious scenes feeling staged, and the more humorous scenes mechanical. I found Nathan to be entirely inappropriate, and his overstated sense of drama unnecessary to the story. Gunn was better, although marginally so.Ultimately this movie is one that could! It could have been so much better. The casting could have been better. The script could have been better. The acting could have been better.

But to only focus on the comedy means not looking at the rest of the story which may have been funny 40 years ago but (I'd have thought) we are more informed now than to produce stuff like this. I'll not repeat the synopsis. Although I disagree with comments that paint the wealthy parents out to be the 'bad parents'. NOTE: From this point there are spoliers. By the end of the movie, due to some coincidences Olaf comes out. There is the appropriate dramatic pause where we wait for the parent's reaction (which we know will be positive as it's the end of the movie and a negative reaction would need more time to resolve that). But what sickened me was that we find that the parents, essentially, knew that had a gay son for many years yet stil tormented and teased him by trying to connect him with the 'preety girl next door'. They literally made a bet on his sexuality. Suicide amongst gay teens is, we are told, high, and apparently part of the reason is that they don't feel accepted by their family or friends.

And the two sets of parents could not have been so different: There's Gunn's loopy, jolly Mom (who bakes TONS of goodies during the movie), a transplanted Wisconsin who says ""Don'tcha Know"" a lot; Sven, the absent-minded, pot-smoking Dad who accidentally flashes Nathan by leaving his robe open; and familiar faces Ian Buchanan (daytime's ""General Hospital"") & Gates McFadden (of ""Star Trek: TNG"" fame) as Nathan's cold & self-centered parents. Viewers might be disappointed that the latter parents are absent through most of the film (which is logical, since they leave their own son in a lurch to travel to Jerusalem at the last minute). Thus, Nathan surprises Gunn at his doorstep when his own family plans fall through. This is where the story might have turned into an ""Afterschool Special"" of melodrama, as Gunn has not told his parents of his true sexuality, let alone that Nathan is more than a roommate. But Williams handles the subplot deftly, and doesn't overplay it, even during a front lawn argument between the two. He keeps the film light & airy while slyly tossing out snickering double entendres that either startle its characters or fly right over their heads.Also of note is ""Little House on the Prairie's"" Alison Arngrim (remember nasty little Nellie?) as a trampy, abrasive neighbor who is the nemesis of Gunn's Mom.In short, whether you're gay or straight, you'll most likely enjoy this small Holiday goodie.

1282865,A224BKBLXVA859,B002PCVLWW,Rocky Sunico,"[1, 1]","The writing of the movie was pretty interesting. I say interesting instead of good or great since there was clearly a certain amount of intelligence and wit involved in a lot of the lines (e.g. ""So you're friends of Dorothy"" - but in reference to a local girl named Dorothy) but delivery was weird and flat. I surmise it was an attempt at more deadpan delivery so the jokes weren't too campy. But they happened so often throughout everyone's dialog (especially the parents) that that in itself became campy.Beyond the jokes, I liked how the story wasn't overly predictable. Sure, it had a number of the tropes that we can associate with either LGBT movies or holiday movies, but it all still worked together. The relationship between Olaf and Nathan felt real enough plus the added complications of the differences in their social classes relative to their families's wealth was an interesting addition that didn't feel too forced or preachy. And that's not exactly an easy balance to strike.I appreciate how the movie avoided a lot of the dumber tropes of queer films like relying too much on casting really beautiful / attractive people who really can't act all that well. Sure, I can appreciate a hot body as much as the next guy but I'd rather have a good story instead of a lot of shirtless posing here and there.

One has to go home to his parents from Minnesota (with great accents, don'cha know!) who don't know he's gay and are trying to fix him up with the girl next door.  The other, the son of cold, rich and distant parents, is suddenly on his own for Christmas as his parents decided to go abroad for the holidays without him and didn't tell him until he was on his way home.So he shows up unexpectedly at his lover's for the holidays.  Complications ensue which threaten to part the lovers but a happy ending saves the day (and Christmas.)  The closet case comes out to his parents (who suspected anyway and are fine with it), and the lonely lad starts to re-develop a relationship with his mother at least.This isn't deathless cinema history--our lead actors are not exactly thespians and the production values are limited--but I don't understand the really negative reviews.
