The second season is finally coming, which was long overdue for many of us who bought season 1 as soon as it came out.The second season of Diff'rent Strokes improves on the first season.  Arnold (Gary Coleman), Willis (Todd Bridges) and Kimberly (the late Dana Plato) begin to grow up and tackle more serious subjects, while at the same time, far from becoming the ""very special episode"" haven it became in its later seasons.  As Arnold, Coleman provided countless laughs and smiles on many peoples faces.  While you can list everything you like about the show, there is no denying that without Gary Coleman, Diff'rent Strokes is not Diff'rent Strokes.I urge every fan of this show, as well as fans of other Sony properties from the era such as The Facts Of Life, One Day At A Time and Silver Spoons, to purchase this set.  Sales for season one were apparently lackluster enough that Sony shelved plans for a lot of era shows on DVD,  the more Strokes sells, the better shot other shows from the era also have coming out.So come January 31st, put your old white socks on with the red stripes and Jordache jeans, and pop open a can of Tab and relive the golden age of Diff'rent Strokes with the release of season 2 on DVD.",5,whatchootalkinbout?

The second season of ""DS"" sees some important changes, which I'll discuss later in the review. Willis, Arnold & Kimberly haven't quite hit puberty, & that's a good thing, for this sitcom hasn't quite hit totally mature & serious subject matter this season - at least not 100%. There's the two-part season opener where Arnold enters the hospital for a kidney operation. He meets a cute neighbor Alice, who also has to have a similar operation. When Alice's father learns she & Arnold might share the same room, he changes his opinion. This was & is a highly controversial & serious episode that tackled prejudice & racism head-on. There's also the season finale where Willis joins a street gang despite Mr. Drummond's objections. There's still plenty of other great, fun episodes in between. There are also a couple of cast changes this season, as Charlotte Rae leaves ""DS"" mid-season to star in her own sitcom ""The Facts of Life"". Shavar Ross & Steven Mond make their first appearances as Dudley Johnson (later Ramsey) & Robbie Jason - Arnold's best friends. Future ""DS"" co-star Mary Ann Mobley makes an appearance as Arnold's teacher in the same episode. Oh, & the theme of responsibility is tackled during this season as well, as Willis gets his first taste of employment, working at an auto-body shop (with nearly disastrous results). This is the first season we are introduced to housekeeper #2 - Adelaide Brubaker (played by Nedra Volz). With plenty of laughs & scenarios to go around, there's enough here to satisfy everyone of any age.

The 1979/1980 season wasn't that different than the first season, but there are a few noticeable differences.  Arnold was a little bigger than he was the previous season.  Dana Plato (Kimberly) plays a bigger role during the season 2 episodes.Season two begins with three painfully slow episodes.  For some reason the shows writers decided not to focus on the ensemble cast.  Episodes 1&2 of the second season feature guest star Dabney Coleman who stars as a businessman with a daughter named Alice.  When Alice finds out he has to have an operation he wants to share a hospital room with Alice, however after the business relationship between Mr. Drummond and Alice's father goes sour he refuses to let the kids share a hospital room.  The third season two episode once again brings the cast of the series ""Hello Larry"" to town.There are some good and funny episodes during season 2. ""Sanford and Son"" funnyman Whitman Mayo appears in ""The Adoption Part 1& 2"" as a junk man whose scam threatens the finalization of the adoption of Arnold and Willis.Race issues continued to be addressed during season 2. Mrs. Garrett would leave the show and be replaced by Adelaide.  Overall, it's a pretty mediocre season.

In my opinion Diff'rent Strokes got better in the 1980's starting with season 3, plus we had more guest stars and people like Janet Jackson who played Willis' main squeeze Charlene, Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones, Arnold's friends Dudley, Kathy, and Robby, Pearl as the housekeeper, Maggie(Mr. D's wife), and Sam as well as less 2 parters.So Sony Distribution, tell me what is the hold-up on the further release of season sets of this Wonderful pop culture phenomenon of this show on DVD.

956337,A3W3OG4JJKFFTV,B000CCBCCQ,RetroRhythms,"[4, 5]","I'm so happy that this finally achieved release! A few months ago, I pretty much figured that there was going to be no Season Two release, for it had already been a year since the first season had been released! I had gone ahead and bought some of the old Columbia House VHS tapes with episodes from seasons two and on; but not long after, I learned this was going to be released!I agree with another reviewer that the second season started off a bit slow. While I enjoyed the episodes about ""Arnold's Girlfriend"" and found the portrayal of the girlfriend's racist father to be relevant, I did not so much enjoy the return of the ""Hello Larry"" cast in ""Feudin' and Fussin'."" McLean Stevenson was a very talented man, but it seems generally agreed that this stage of his career was a weak one ... and in this character, his acting seems particularly forced and overdone. Or perhaps part of that is that the script for the show was a little unnatural and drawn out.Now, to the GOOD STUFF!...My favorite episode from this season is ""Slumber Party."" Just the pillow fight scene alone makes it worthwhile somehow; but aside from that, the presence of both ""Willis""'s friends and Kimberly's ""Facts of Life"" buddies adds a certain dynamic element that is very effective....what with all of the fighting going on. Furthermore, it's a pleasure to see the late, very talented Frank De Vol in the role of the restaurant violinist who just can't get his song done because of the constant calls Mr. Drummond receives! ""Return of the Gooch"" is another episode with a lot of laughs. Just seeing Gary Coleman do his karate moves was great fun, and the actor playing the instructor also added a nice element. ""Big Business"" is also very enticing. In it, Arnold and Willis decide to go into business based on the brownies of their new housekeeper, Adelaide, but don't realize the dues that have to be paid!DIFF'RENT STROKES was certainly a unique show. In many ways it was unrealistic, but it also had a certain idealism and positivity that makes it charming to this day. Of course, Gary Coleman, Todd Bridges, and Conrad Bain were all very talented actors who carried their roles strongly. Unfortunately, the writing sometimes had very noticeable gaps and sudden conclusions that made it hard for the actors to make it seem natural! But as with all sitcoms, there is a certain suspension of disbelief that the viewer has to have, so all in all, those shortcomings can be forgiven....especially given the positive message this show was aiming to send when others wouldn't take on that task. And most of the time, they did it with a lot of laughs! I'm speaking specifically of interracial relations. The writers and producers did a good job of handling the situations well, and presenting both sides of the issues. And Gary Coleman delivered so many laugh-inducing performances along the way!I'm very grateful to have two seasons of this show on DVD now. I can only hope that we'll see more!",4,A Worthy Investment,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,2972,"[""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'finally', 'achieved', 'release', 'few', 'months', 'pretty', 'much', 'figured', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Season', 'Two', 'release', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'year', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'had', 'gone', 'ahead', 'bought', 'old', 'Columbia', 'House', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'two', 'not', 'long', 'learned', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'second', 'season', 'started', 'off', 'bit', 'slow', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'Arnold', 'Girlfriend', 'found', 'portrayal', 'girlfriend', 'racist', 'father', 'be', 'relevant', 'did', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'return', 'Hello', 'Larry', 'cast', 'Feudin', 'Fussin', 'McLean', 'Stevenson', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'man', 'generally', 'agreed', 'stage', 'career', 'was', 'weak', 'one', 'character', 'acting', 'particularly', 'forced', 'perhaps', 'part', 'script', 'show', 'was', 'little', 'unnatural', 'drawn', 'out.Now', 'GOOD', 'STUFF', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'pillow', 'fight', 'scene', 'alone', 'worthwhile', 'somehow', 'aside', 'presence', 'Willis', 'friends', 'Kimberly', 'Facts', 'Life', 'buddies', 'certain', 'dynamic', 'element', 'very', 'effective', '.what', 'fighting', 'going', 'Furthermore', 'pleasure', 'see', 'late', 'very', 'talented', 'Frank', 'De', 'Vol', 'role', 'restaurant', 'violinist', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'song', 'done', 'constant', 'Mr.', 'Drummond', 'Return', 'Gooch', 'episode', 'lot', 'laughs', 'Just', 'seeing', 'Gary', 'Coleman', 'do', 'karate', 'moves', 'was', 'great', 'fun', 'actor', 'playing', 'instructor', 'also', 'added', 'nice', 'element', 'Big', 'Business', 'also', 'very', 'enticing', 'Arnold', 'Willis', 'decide', 'go', 'business', 'based', 'brownies', 'new', 'housekeeper', 'Adelaide', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'dues', 'have', 'be', 'paid', ""DIFF'RENT"", 'STROKES', 'was', 'certainly', 'unique', 'show', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'also', 'had', 'certain', 'idealism', 'positivity', 'charming', 'day', 'course', 'Gary', 'Coleman', 'Todd', 'Bridges', 'Conrad', 'Bain', 'were', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'carried', 'roles', 'strongly', 'Unfortunately', 'writing', 'sometimes', 'had', 'very', 'noticeable', 'gaps', 'sudden', 'conclusions', 'made', 'hard', 'actors', 'make', 'seem', 'natural', 'sitcoms', 'certain', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'viewer', 'have', 'shortcomings', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', '.especially', 'given', 'positive', 'message', 'show', 'was', 'aiming', 'send', 'when', 'others', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'task', 'most', 'time', 'did', 'lot', 'laughs', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'specifically', 'interracial', 'relations', 'writers', 'producers', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'handling', 'situations', 'well', 'presenting', 'sides', 'issues', 'Gary', 'Coleman', 'delivered', 'so', 'many', 'laugh-inducing', 'performances', 'way', ""'m"", 'very', 'grateful', 'have', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'DVD', 'now', 'can', 'only', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more']",Diff'rent Strokes - The Complete Second Season
