I was surprised however to find I have grown up since I last watched these shows (when they were on the very first time). Shows I loved as a youngster didn't do it for me as an adult, and shows I had to sit through as a kid because my parents liked them were the ones I enjoyed most.  All that aside, this was a very well produced product. I thought the quality was very good,both picture and sound. It may not have all the bells and whistles some people want in a DVD these days,but fills the bill if you want to see some of your favorite crime drama from back in the day.",4,Prime example of 70's police dramas,1224374400,"10 19, 2008",2008,656,"['was', 'excited', 'when', 'offering', 'arrived', 'mail', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'was', 'surprised', 'however', 'find', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'last', 'watched', 'shows', 'when', 'were', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'loved', 'youngster', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'adult', 'had', 'sit', 'kid', 'parents', 'liked', 'were', 'ones', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'aside', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'product', 'thought', 'quality', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'bells', 'people', 'want', 'DVD', 'days', 'bill', 'want', 'see', 'favorite', 'crime', 'drama', 'back', 'day']",N/A

You get the first episodes of 5 classic 70's cop shows.1. Charlies Angels2. The Rookies3. Starsky and Hutch4. Swat5. Police WomanI love all these shows, but I espacially love Police Woman and Starsky and Hutch. I grew up watching these shows, and there is not a cop show today that can hold a candle to these shows. I have some Charlie's Angels on dvd, and Starsky and Hutch on VHS from Columbia House, but I have missed watching Police Woman in over 25 years. I had a serious crush on Angie Dickinson back in the day. This is a great dvd of classic tv, when tv was entertaining, not all this reality crap that is on now. I just hope they realease more Police Woman and Starsky and Hutch on dvd. Its well worth the price and then some.

499290,A2ZQ990AWKIO8W,B00000F6RL,Michael A. Nelson,"[13, 16]","I was a child of the 70s and remembered these shows fondly.  I took them VERY seriously at the time.  Now they are instant nostalgia and a hoot.  I love the bland studio bars and apartments, the lack of much blood after some serious gun fights, the friendly neo-fascist cops who do their duty & then go party.  These are the ""first"" episodes of each show but that is misleading.  Most started as 2 hour movies of the week.  These are the first of the on going episodes but in most cases the viewer's second helping.The Rookies-the most social conscious of the group.  The street wise cop who grew up in the 'hood with the very naive suburban kid.  Nice sentiments here about getting through to gang members excpet that these guys are psuhing 40 when they should be teens & the slum is obviously a Hollywood backlot with lots of newspapers thrown all over it.Police Woman-good drama, Angie does some nice touches.  The show isn't just about her though, a whole unit so it's kinda misleading.  That hippuie undercover has on of the oddest faces to grace a TV screen.  And I loved the casual traffic driving past a desperate shoot out early on.SWAT-Now this felt like a pilot.  Like most of SWAT's villains, total psychos.  Although no one mentions it, they are sniffing alot during the episode so grown up viewers will know that they are all coked up.Starsky & Hutch-lame plot but good commadarie.  Watch for a sexy cameo but Suzanne Sommers.  This show was a little more into innuendo but then came...Charlie's Angels-not a cop show!  This one actually isz the first time we'd seen the Angels.  Not bad but the whole Doyle as a preacher bit was grating.  I remeber them calling this a ""jiggle show""  but note the lack of the extra large busts we've come to expect nowadays.I wish they'd have released the ""best"" ep of each show rather than the ""first"", now that would be a 5 star DVD!",4,3 stars if you didn't grow up with these shows,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,1883,"['was', 'child', '70s', 'remembered', 'shows', 'fondly', 'took', 'VERY', 'seriously', 'time', 'Now', 'are', 'instant', 'nostalgia', 'hoot', 'love', 'bland', 'studio', 'bars', 'apartments', 'lack', 'much', 'blood', 'serious', 'gun', 'fights', 'friendly', 'neo-fascist', 'cops', 'who', 'do', 'duty', 'then', 'go', 'party', 'are', 'first', 'episodes', 'show', 'misleading', 'Most', 'started', '2', 'hour', 'movies', 'week', 'are', 'first', 'going', 'episodes', 'most', 'cases', 'viewer', 'second', 'helping.The', 'Rookies-the', 'most', 'social', 'conscious', 'group', 'street', 'wise', 'cop', 'who', 'grew', 'up', ""'hood"", 'very', 'naive', 'suburban', 'kid', 'Nice', 'sentiments', 'here', 'getting', 'gang', 'members', 'excpet', 'guys', 'are', 'psuhing', '40', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'teens', 'slum', 'obviously', 'Hollywood', 'backlot', 'lots', 'newspapers', 'thrown', 'it.Police', 'Woman-good', 'drama', 'Angie', 'nice', 'touches', 'show', ""n't"", 'just', 'though', 'whole', 'unit', 'kinda', 'misleading', 'hippuie', 'oddest', 'grace', 'TV', 'screen', 'loved', 'casual', 'traffic', 'driving', 'desperate', 'shoot', 'out', 'early', 'on.SWAT-Now', 'felt', 'pilot', 'most', 'SWAT', 'villains', 'total', 'psychos', 'one', 'mentions', 'are', 'sniffing', 'alot', 'episode', 'so', 'grown', 'up', 'viewers', 'will', 'know', 'are', 'coked', 'up.Starsky', 'Hutch-lame', 'plot', 'good', 'commadarie', 'Watch', 'sexy', 'cameo', 'Suzanne', 'Sommers', 'show', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'innuendo', 'then', 'came', 'Charlie', 'Angels-not', 'cop', 'show', 'one', 'actually', 'isz', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Angels', 'Not', 'bad', 'whole', 'Doyle', 'preacher', 'bit', 'was', 'grating', 'remeber', 'calling', 'jiggle', 'show', 'note', 'lack', 'extra', 'large', 'busts', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'nowadays.I', 'wish', ""'d"", 'have', 'released', 'best', 'ep', 'show', 'rather', 'first', 'now', 'would', 'be', '5', 'star', 'DVD']",N/A
