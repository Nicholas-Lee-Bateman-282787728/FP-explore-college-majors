The Possum sings all of his big hits on this one with his voice as smoothe and crisp as ever. The sound quality is excellent except for the over dubbing of crowd applause that is more than occaisionally annoying. The only other flaw is the poor quality stage lighting makes a complete mess of the color production. The Possums Jones boys led by the ever faithfull to GJ, Ron Gaddis is tighter than ever on this one. I notice Mel Tillis' lead guitarist helping out here and a fiddle player from N.C. that is without question the finest that I have ever seen. Combined with the finest players in the land and the finest C&W ballad singer in the land, this is Country at its best.
