160789,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,080010482X,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","One of the most spellbinding films I've ever seen, and certainly the film that Sidney Poitier should be remembered for (and the one that should have netted him the Oscar, not that horribly mediocre `Lilies of the Field' film), `A Raisin in the Sun' is a powerful look at racism, poverty, religion, dreams and aspirations as well as to importance of family and togetherness.  With a stellar cast (seriously, Oscar nominations should have been handed out to nearly everyone) and a tightly woven and poignant script, this film is a total must see.I think it is safe to say that I didn't expect this to move me as much as it did.The film revolves around a check for $10,000, made out to Lena Younger, the matriarch of an African American family living in Chicago.  With the check scheduled to arrive in mere days, everyone in the family is expressing their feelings as to how the money should be spent.  Despite seemingly noble motives, the divided interests of the family begin to ware at the fibers of their unity and cause them to turn on one another.  Walter is a struggling chauffer who just wants a chance to provide for his family.  His plans are hasty but he means well.  His wife, Ruth, looks at the expected money as a chance to get out of their small, cramped living space and really spread out (get their son off the couch maybe), but her role as `supportive wife' makes it difficult to really voice her concerns.  Beneatha, Walter's sister, is spoiled and nave to her cultured existence, developing a certain arrogance that lends itself to disapproval from those around her.  She, of course, feels that the money should be spent on furthering her education.In the end, the final hand is to be dealt by Lena herself, a wise woman who knows just how to give her family what they need, even if they don't see it that way.The film, adapted from a stage play, never plays to the confines that most stage-to-screen adaptations bare with.  It feels open and free even if the scenes all take place within the small confines of a cramped apartment (mostly).  This is thanks in large part to the fantastic performances that litter the screen.  Sidney Poitier, an actor I often find stiff and highly overrated, is a revelation here as Walter.  He just commands every scene with a theatrical naturalness that is rarely seen in films today.  He is supporting by a strong female cast, most notably Ruby Dee, who is beautifully restrained as Ruth.  Diana Sands is also stellar as the self-centered Beneatha, and Claudia McNeil is remarkable as the wise Lena Younger.With a delicate yet affirmative stand on very sensitive subjects, `A Raisin in the Sun' is a beautiful film that everyone should see.  I have not seen the made-for-television remake, but I cannot imagine it can hold a candle to this finely crafted and unforgettable experience.",5,The sun shines brightly on this unforgettable masterpiece...,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,2837,"['One', 'most', 'spellbinding', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'film', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'netted', 'Oscar', 'not', 'horribly', 'mediocre', 'Lilies', 'Field', 'film', 'Raisin', 'Sun', ""'"", 'powerful', 'look', 'racism', 'poverty', 'religion', 'dreams', 'aspirations', 'as', 'well', 'importance', 'family', 'togetherness', 'stellar', 'cast', 'seriously', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'handed', 'out', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'tightly', 'woven', 'poignant', 'script', 'film', 'total', 'must', 'see.I', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'move', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'revolves', 'check', '10,000', 'made', 'out', 'Lena', 'Younger', 'matriarch', 'African', 'American', 'family', 'living', 'Chicago', 'check', 'scheduled', 'arrive', 'mere', 'days', 'everyone', 'family', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'how', 'money', 'should', 'be', 'spent', 'seemingly', 'noble', 'motives', 'divided', 'interests', 'family', 'begin', 'ware', 'fibers', 'unity', 'cause', 'turn', 'one', 'Walter', 'struggling', 'chauffer', 'who', 'just', 'chance', 'provide', 'family', 'plans', 'are', 'hasty', 'well', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'expected', 'money', 'chance', 'get', 'small', 'cramped', 'living', 'space', 'really', 'spread', 'out', 'get', 'son', 'couch', 'maybe', 'role', 'supportive', 'wife', 'difficult', 'really', 'voice', 'concerns', 'Beneatha', 'Walter', 'sister', 'spoiled', 'nave', 'cultured', 'existence', 'developing', 'certain', 'arrogance', 'disapproval', 'course', 'money', 'should', 'be', 'spent', 'furthering', 'education.In', 'end', 'final', 'hand', 'be', 'dealt', 'Lena', 'wise', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'how', 'give', 'family', 'what', 'need', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way.The', 'film', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'never', 'confines', 'most', 'stage-to-screen', 'adaptations', 'bare', 'open', 'free', 'even', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'small', 'confines', 'cramped', 'apartment', 'mostly', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'litter', 'screen', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'actor', 'often', 'find', 'stiff', 'highly', 'overrated', 'revelation', 'here', 'Walter', 'just', 'scene', 'theatrical', 'naturalness', 'rarely', 'seen', 'films', 'today', 'supporting', 'strong', 'female', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'who', 'beautifully', 'restrained', 'Ruth', 'Diana', 'Sands', 'also', 'stellar', 'self-centered', 'Beneatha', 'Claudia', 'McNeil', 'remarkable', 'wise', 'Lena', 'Younger.With', 'delicate', 'yet', 'affirmative', 'stand', 'very', 'sensitive', 'subjects', 'Raisin', 'Sun', ""'"", 'beautiful', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'made-for-television', 'remake', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'can', 'hold', 'candle', 'finely', 'crafted', 'unforgettable', 'experience']",N/A

It won the 1960 Best Play Tony; Sidney Poitier and Claudia McNeill were both nominated for acting Tonys. The main cast of the play appears in this David Susskind produced COLUMBIA motion picture. Director: Daniel Petrie.SYNOPSIS--Lena Younger (McNeil) has lived in the same cramped, sunless Chicago tenement apartment all her married life. Now a widow, Lena plans to use a portion of her husband's 10K life insurance policy as down payment on a pleasant home in a white neighborhood. The balance will be evenly divided between her 35-year-old son Walter Jr. (Poitier) and 20-year-old daughter Beneatha (Sands), a college student with dreams of becoming a doctor.Beneatha is seeing Asagai (Dixon), a Nigerian exchange student, and now she preaches against ""assimilation"" and embraces traditional African garb and music.Walter and wife Ruth (Dee) have a young son named Travis (Perry). Like his mom and sister, Walter also has dreams. He wants to quit being a white man's chauffeur and become partners in a package store with Bobo (Fluellen) and fast-talking Willie Harris (Glenn). His hopes are crushed when the insurance check arrives and Mama refuses to invest in Walter's liquor store idea.Walter despairs that his last chance to make something of himself is gone. He spends three days in a local bar and is on the verge of getting fired. Lena comes for him, gives Walter her remaining 7K with instructions that half is for Beneatha's tuition and the rest for Walter to open a checking account with. He asks in surprise if she trusts him with this money and Mama answers ""I've always trusted you.""The Youngers' moving day is interrupted by a distraught Bobo. Con man Wille has disappeared with Bobo's life savings and with the money Mama entrusted to Walter. The dreams of all seem irrevocably shattered.Roy Glenn, who appears briefly as Willie, was a regular supporting player on the controversial TV sitcom,THE AMOS 'N' ANDY SHOW.

So I am disposed to like this movie. But it is an odd little black-and-white heart-wrencher.Walter Lee Younger (Poitier) is 35, works as a chauffeur for a rich white guy, and wants something more out of life. His mother Lena (Claudia McNeil) is about to receive a check for $10,000 from her husband's life insurance, and everyone in the family has an idea of how to spend it. Of course they all say that money is Mama's and it's up to her what she does with it. But they dream.Walter wants to invest all or most of it in a partnership with two of his friends to buy a bar. Mama says she's not going to use her dead husband's money to sell people liquor, it's not a fitting memorial to a hard-working man.His sister Beneatha (Diana Sands) is a thoroughly modern college student who wants to be a doctor. She has a passion for all things African, including Joseph Asagai, a charming young Nigerian who goes to college with her. She also considers herself above her mother's simple Christian faith, declaring that she's sick of hearing about God.But Mama wants to buy a house to get them out of their too-small apartment. Especially since Walter's wife (Ruby Dee) is pregnant. Their son is already sleeping on the couch because there's not enough room for everyone, they share a bathroom in the hallway with another apartment, and the idea of one more leads her to consider abortion. Of course Mama thinks that is ""talking about killing babies"" and blows up about it.So when Mama gets the check, she puts a down payment on a house. They go and see the house, which is in an all-white neighborhood, and they all love it. Then they receive a visit from the chairman of the Neighborhood Improvement Committee, a wimpy little white guy who explains very condescendingly that ""people are happier when they live in neighborhoods with their own kind,"" and offers to buy their interest in the house and include a profit. They angrily order him out of their house.Without telling anyone, Walter hasn't gone to work for three days when his boss's wife calls and says he will be out of a job if he doesn't show up tomorrow. Mama goes to the club where he is drowning his sorrows in beer. She explains that she put $3,500 down on the house, and then hands the rest of it (in cash) to Walter to show that she trusts him. She tells him to put $3,000 in a savings account for Beneatha to go to medical school, and put the rest in a checking account in his name, and he'll be the head of the household. But he takes the entire $6,500 and gives it to his friend Willy, who is supposed to use it for the bar. Predictably, Willy disappears with his money and his other friend Bobo's money.So how is this tangled mess of emotions and finances and contest of wills resolved? I'll have to leave SOME things for the movie to tell you. Can't give it all away. As I said, it's a heart-wrencher. Be sure you have a good supply of tissues when you watch this one. It's good, even if it is a bit over-played for the emotional roller coaster. I suspect it is pretty authentic for all that. I recognize some of that mercurial personality Walter displays as pretty typical of a man who is frustrated because he feels he's not going anywhere. My own father got like that.I enjoyed it, but even more, I respect it as a real American story. And like I said, I've had the hots for Sidney Poitier for nearly 50 years.",4,"Rather Gritty Drama, Very Well Told",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3506,"['First', ""'ve"", 'had', 'hots', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'ever', 'was', '11', '12', 'found', 'was', 'OK', 'admit', 'black', 'man', 'was', 'sexy', 'So', 'am', 'disposed', 'like', 'movie', 'odd', 'little', 'black-and-white', 'heart-wrencher.Walter', 'Lee', 'Younger', 'Poitier', '35', 'chauffeur', 'rich', 'white', 'guy', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'mother', 'Lena', 'Claudia', 'McNeil', 'receive', 'check', '10,000', 'husband', 'life', 'insurance', 'everyone', 'family', 'idea', 'how', 'spend', 'course', 'say', 'money', 'Mama', 'up', 'what', 'dream.Walter', 'invest', 'most', 'partnership', 'two', 'friends', 'buy', 'bar', 'Mama', 'not', 'going', 'use', 'dead', 'husband', 'money', 'sell', 'people', 'liquor', 'not', 'fitting', 'memorial', 'hard-working', 'man.His', 'sister', 'Beneatha', 'Diana', 'Sands', 'thoroughly', 'modern', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'be', 'doctor', 'passion', 'things', 'African', 'including', 'Joseph', 'Asagai', 'charming', 'young', 'Nigerian', 'who', 'college', 'also', 'mother', 'simple', 'Christian', 'faith', 'declaring', 'sick', 'hearing', 'God.But', 'Mama', 'buy', 'house', 'get', 'too-small', 'apartment', 'Especially', 'Walter', 'wife', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'pregnant', 'son', 'already', 'sleeping', 'couch', 'not', 'enough', 'room', 'everyone', 'share', 'bathroom', 'hallway', 'apartment', 'idea', 'one', 'more', 'consider', 'abortion', 'course', 'Mama', 'talking', 'killing', 'babies', 'up', 'about', 'it.So', 'when', 'Mama', 'check', 'down', 'payment', 'house', 'go', 'see', 'house', 'all-white', 'neighborhood', 'love', 'Then', 'receive', 'visit', 'chairman', 'Neighborhood', 'Improvement', 'Committee', 'wimpy', 'little', 'white', 'guy', 'who', 'very', 'condescendingly', 'people', 'are', 'happier', 'when', 'live', 'neighborhoods', 'own', 'kind', 'buy', 'interest', 'house', 'include', 'profit', 'angrily', 'order', 'house.Without', 'telling', 'anyone', 'Walter', ""n't"", 'gone', 'work', 'three', 'days', 'when', 'boss', 'wife', 'calls', 'will', 'be', 'job', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'tomorrow', 'Mama', 'club', 'where', 'drowning', 'sorrows', 'beer', 'put', '3,500', 'down', 'house', 'then', 'rest', 'cash', 'Walter', 'show', 'put', '3,000', 'savings', 'account', 'Beneatha', 'go', 'medical', 'school', 'put', 'rest', 'checking', 'account', 'name', ""'ll"", 'be', 'head', 'household', 'entire', '6,500', 'friend', 'Willy', 'who', 'supposed', 'use', 'bar', 'Predictably', 'Willy', 'money', 'other', 'friend', 'Bobo', 'money.So', 'how', 'tangled', 'mess', 'emotions', 'finances', 'contest', 'wills', 'resolved', ""'ll"", 'have', 'leave', 'SOME', 'things', 'movie', 'tell', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'said', 'heart-wrencher', 'Be', 'sure', 'have', 'good', 'supply', 'tissues', 'when', 'watch', 'one', 'good', 'even', 'bit', 'over-played', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'suspect', 'pretty', 'authentic', 'recognize', 'mercurial', 'personality', 'Walter', 'displays', 'pretty', 'typical', 'man', 'who', 'frustrated', 'not', 'going', 'anywhere', 'own', 'father', 'got', 'that.I', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'more', 'respect', 'real', 'American', 'story', 'said', ""'ve"", 'had', 'hots', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'nearly', '50', 'years']",N/A
160797,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,080010482X,Birdman,"[3, 3]","For one who has never had the chance to se this luminous film, you have a rare treat in store. Lorraine Hansberry adapted her NY Drama Critics Circle Award-winning drama for the screen in 1961. It is a deeply compassionate film with an ensemble cast unequaled in its day.Hansberry had the power to translate a black family's struggles into a universal parable that bears repeated viewing for its magnificent dialogue, rich black and white photography and unforgettable performances.It was the film that launched not only Sidney Poitier's career, and also inspired the start of so many other careers for talented African-Americans. Claudia McNeil's performance is towering as Lena Younger, her final soliloquy (""Have You Cried for That Boy Today?"") one of the most moving highlights of the film.Ruby Dee's nuanced portrayal of Ruth Younger is one in which the actress is completely immersed in her character: beautiful, vulnerable, tenacious. Even when the script calls for Ruth to be resigned, grief-stricken or fatigued, she is infused with life and is always very, very beautiful.Diana Sands also delivers a bravura role as Lena's headstrong daughter, providing much of the comic relief in the script.The pacing of Daniel Petrie's direction is flawless and Lawrence Rosenthal's musical score heartrending.My only complaint is that Columbia Pictures has not yet released a fully-remastered, two disc special edition of this  historic film. The package provides a ""widecreen"" version of the film on one side and a full-screen version on the other. The film source run on the full-screen side is slightly off-speed, painfully evident inmusical pitch of the main title. So buyers should just move to the wide-screen side, whichhas a warmer transfer with the source film running on-speed.

Credit goes in no small part to the wonderful cast (Sidney Poitier as the mercurial Walter Lee Younger, the legendary Ruby Dee as his wife, Ruth, Diana Sands as his spirited sister, Beneatha, and Claudia McNeil as the matriarch, Lena Younger).RAISIN is centered on the Younger family.  When Lena Younger, the mother and head of the family, is widowed, she is left with $10,000.00 in insurance money.  The family must decide how to spend the inheritance.  It is between funding her daughter, Beneatha's education and purchasing a house for the family.  Walter Lee wants to invest part of the inheritance in a business (specifically, a liquor store).This film examines the African-American experience in 1950s Chicago, where racial tensions are strong (and remain so today).  There is also an underlying examination of the strain existing in the African-American experience in the United States (specifically, in the experiences and conflicts in the identity of Beneatha, Walter Lee's younger sister).  An example of the tension between the African and African-American experience is really illustrated in Beneatha's interest in African culture and her commitment to establishing pride in her identity.  This play is truly a groundbreaking, important and truly original look at the African-American experience.  I really reccomend that everyone see it!

160805,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,080010482X,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[2, 3]","In terms of cinematography and multidimensional characterization this film is flawless. Claudia McNeil does a superb job as Mama, the head of the Younger family. She depicts successfully the foundation that the family needs in times of both trouble and struggle. For instance, in the one scene after Walter is about to give in to ""the man"" and his sister is disgusted with him, Mama quickly advises her to understand that ""there is always something left to love."" This is a recurrent idea embedded in the film: through thick and thin, troubled times or good, the essence of moving forward, being successful, is to look past mistakes and try to see the good in all, especially those who are closest to you.The other characters are also multifaceted, not only having good characteristics, but also negative ones. Walter seems to be a man who struggles with alcohol, Ruth struggles to cope with the idea of bringing another child in the world, and Beneatha is often impatient and rude to those who don't think like her. Yet, it is through these faults that the characters become stronger. The whole concept of self-reformation is prevalent in many of the moments of the film, as the characters try not only to accept others, but become better themselves in some way for the benefit of the family.The film really is a testament to not only the situation of African-American families in the 1950s but the struggle of any family trying to better their situation in life. After the Younger family receives the check for ten thousand dollars they try to figure out what would be the best thing to invest this in. Walter Lee (Sidney Pointier), the movie's protagonist, has dreams of giving his son Travis and family a better life than he had, and decides to try to invest the money in a risky investment, a liquor store. While this turns out to be a foolish mistake, it is his realization of what is important for family that becomes the essence of his character.  His sister, Beneatha, is perhaps his complete opposite being a college student who is all about free thinking, and has big dreams of being a doctor. All in all, the family struggles to not only exist in an apartment making ends meat, but to gain the foundation for getting ahead in life.One of the major morals of the film is the importance of keeping family together. There are many instances where the family appears to be falling apart, but Mama continues to help everyone resolve their disputes for the common good of everyone's interests, and she also inflects the values that her late husband had onto both Walter and Beneatha.Another great aspect of this film is the ability to keep the feel of the play alive. Most movies have a hard time transferring from play to movie without losing much of the significance and essence intended, but this film almost comes across exactly as the play. There are great performances all around, and this is a movie that will make you think deeply about the struggles of not only past generations, but also the struggles of ""making it"" in today's world.",5,"""There is always something left to love""",1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,3050,"['terms', 'cinematography', 'multidimensional', 'characterization', 'film', 'flawless', 'Claudia', 'McNeil', 'superb', 'job', 'Mama', 'head', 'Younger', 'family', 'successfully', 'foundation', 'family', 'times', 'trouble', 'struggle', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'Walter', 'give', 'man', 'sister', 'disgusted', 'Mama', 'quickly', 'understand', 'always', 'something', 'left', 'love', 'recurrent', 'idea', 'embedded', 'film', 'thick', 'thin', 'troubled', 'times', 'good', 'essence', 'moving', 'forward', 'being', 'successful', 'look', 'past', 'mistakes', 'try', 'see', 'good', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'closest', 'you.The', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'multifaceted', 'not', 'only', 'having', 'good', 'characteristics', 'also', 'negative', 'ones', 'Walter', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'alcohol', 'Ruth', 'cope', 'idea', 'bringing', 'child', 'world', 'Beneatha', 'often', 'impatient', 'rude', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'faults', 'characters', 'become', 'stronger', 'whole', 'concept', 'self-reformation', 'prevalent', 'many', 'moments', 'film', 'characters', 'try', 'not', 'only', 'accept', 'others', 'become', 'better', 'way', 'benefit', 'family.The', 'film', 'really', 'testament', 'not', 'only', 'situation', 'African-American', 'families', '1950s', 'struggle', 'family', 'trying', 'better', 'situation', 'life', 'Younger', 'family', 'check', 'ten', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'invest', 'Walter', 'Lee', 'Sidney', 'Pointier', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'dreams', 'giving', 'son', 'Travis', 'family', 'better', 'life', 'had', 'decides', 'try', 'invest', 'money', 'risky', 'investment', 'liquor', 'store', 'out', 'be', 'foolish', 'mistake', 'realization', 'what', 'important', 'family', 'essence', 'character', 'sister', 'Beneatha', 'perhaps', 'complete', 'opposite', 'being', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'free', 'thinking', 'big', 'dreams', 'being', 'doctor', 'family', 'not', 'only', 'exist', 'apartment', 'making', 'ends', 'meat', 'gain', 'foundation', 'getting', 'ahead', 'life.One', 'major', 'morals', 'film', 'importance', 'keeping', 'family', 'together', 'are', 'many', 'instances', 'where', 'family', 'be', 'falling', 'apart', 'Mama', 'help', 'everyone', 'resolve', 'disputes', 'common', 'good', 'everyone', 'interests', 'also', 'values', 'late', 'husband', 'had', 'Walter', 'Beneatha.Another', 'great', 'aspect', 'film', 'ability', 'keep', 'feel', 'play', 'alive', 'Most', 'movies', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'transferring', 'play', 'movie', 'losing', 'much', 'significance', 'essence', 'intended', 'film', 'almost', 'across', 'exactly', 'play', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'around', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'deeply', 'struggles', 'not', 'only', 'past', 'generations', 'also', 'struggles', 'making', 'today', 'world']",N/A

So begins what is perhaps Langston Hughes' most famous poem ""A Dream Deferred"" and ends with the line, ""Or does it explode?"" The writer Lorraine Hansberry lifted the quotation from Hughes' powerful poem for her equally powerful award-winning play that ultimately became the 1961 film starring Sidney Poitier, Claudia McNeil, Ruby Dee and Diana Sands, directed by Daniel Petrie for which Ms. Hansberry wrote the screenplay.It is safe to say that America had never seen a film quite like this one coming not that long after Brown v. Board of Education and on the eve of the racial change of the 1960's. I saw the film in Syracuse, New York in 1964; and as a white Southerner, I was so pleased with myself. Now over 40 years later it has only gotten better with time. Sad to say, one need only drive though practically any neighborhood in any city in any state in the union to see that unfortunately forty years after the passage of the Federal Fair Housing Act the pupose of which was to make racial discrimination in housing illegal and to promote integration many African American familes experience what the Younger family did in Chicago. They are not welcome in an all-white neighborhood and are confronted with racial prejudice when they try to purhase a home. Our nation remains racially segregated.But the film is much more than about race. It is also about the conflict of generations and between husbands and wives. It is about pride and dreams, living your dreams through your children, the importance of family, and redemption through love. As the matriarch of the family Lena Younger says, you should never stop loving someone, particularly when they are at the lowest: ""There is always something to love.""There is so much conflict in this wondrous film that it practically explodes. The acting by everyone is impeccable. Sidney Poitier, who for years was the only black actor to have received an Oscar for best actor (""Lilies of the Field"") should have won an academy award for his performance as Walter Lee Younger. His confrontation with the white representative from the Community Improvement Association is as good as acting gets. ""We are going to try to be good neighbors."" Of course Ruby Dee is an American treasure. And Claudia McNeil is magnificent as the matriarch of the family, its moral center, who seeps love and compassion although her love is tough. There is one powerful scene (of many) where she makes her daughter Beneatha all full of dreams of Africa and medical school and no religion repeat: ""In my mother's house there is a God.""If there is any lover of movies alive today who hasn't seen this particular version of this truly American story, you owe it to youself to rent what is one of the best American films ever made.",5,An American Classic In Black And White,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,2832,"['What', 'dream', 'deferred', 'dry', 'up', 'raisin', 'sun', 'So', 'what', 'perhaps', 'Langston', 'Hughes', 'most', 'famous', 'poem', 'Dream', 'Deferred', 'line', 'explode', 'writer', 'Lorraine', 'Hansberry', 'lifted', 'quotation', 'Hughes', 'powerful', 'poem', 'equally', 'powerful', 'award-winning', 'play', 'ultimately', 'became', '1961', 'film', 'starring', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Claudia', 'McNeil', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'Diana', 'Sands', 'directed', 'Daniel', 'Petrie', 'Ms.', 'Hansberry', 'wrote', 'screenplay.It', 'safe', 'say', 'America', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'quite', 'one', 'coming', 'not', 'long', 'Brown', 'v.', 'Board', 'Education', 'eve', 'racial', 'change', '1960', 'saw', 'film', 'Syracuse', 'New', 'York', '1964', 'white', 'Southerner', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'Now', '40', 'years', 'later', 'only', 'gotten', 'better', 'time', 'Sad', 'say', 'one', 'need', 'only', 'drive', 'practically', 'neighborhood', 'city', 'state', 'union', 'see', 'unfortunately', 'forty', 'years', 'passage', 'Federal', 'Fair', 'Housing', 'Act', 'pupose', 'was', 'make', 'racial', 'discrimination', 'housing', 'illegal', 'promote', 'integration', 'many', 'African', 'American', 'familes', 'experience', 'what', 'Younger', 'family', 'did', 'Chicago', 'are', 'not', 'welcome', 'all-white', 'neighborhood', 'are', 'confronted', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'when', 'try', 'purhase', 'home', 'nation', 'racially', 'segregated.But', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'about', 'race', 'also', 'conflict', 'generations', 'husbands', 'wives', 'pride', 'dreams', 'living', 'dreams', 'children', 'importance', 'family', 'redemption', 'love', 'matriarch', 'family', 'Lena', 'Younger', 'should', 'never', 'stop', 'loving', 'someone', 'particularly', 'when', 'are', 'lowest', 'always', 'something', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'conflict', 'wondrous', 'film', 'practically', 'acting', 'everyone', 'impeccable', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'who', 'years', 'was', 'only', 'black', 'actor', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actor', 'Lilies', 'Field', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'performance', 'Walter', 'Lee', 'Younger', 'confrontation', 'white', 'representative', 'Community', 'Improvement', 'Association', 'as', 'good', 'acting', 'are', 'going', 'try', 'be', 'good', 'neighbors', 'course', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'American', 'treasure', 'Claudia', 'McNeil', 'magnificent', 'matriarch', 'family', 'moral', 'center', 'who', 'love', 'compassion', 'love', 'tough', 'one', 'powerful', 'scene', 'many', 'where', 'daughter', 'Beneatha', 'full', 'dreams', 'Africa', 'medical', 'school', 'religion', 'repeat', 'mother', 'house', 'God', 'lover', 'movies', 'alive', 'today', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'particular', 'version', 'truly', 'American', 'story', 'owe', 'youself', 'rent', 'what', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'films', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

In a way it was a relief that all those reviews were complaining about the quality of various version of the DVD on the market. So, I want to make it clear that I am commenting on the original MGM, black & white version with Sidney Poitier.Most of the cast were in the original stage version of A RAISIN IN THE SUN--that must have been a hell of a performance. The play/film stands out as a shinning dramatic reflection of the Civil Rights movement. According to TCM's Robert Osborn there was creative tension between Poitier & Claudia McNeil who played his morally powerful mother. Poitier believed the script spun around the son and McNeil, of course, felt the mother was at the center. An interesting dilemma. In the end Poitier won out, but the conflict between the actors probably was good for the dramatic tension--and there is PLENTY of dramtic tension in  the movie.It is a conflict of personalities within a family & the social/racial tensions in soiciety at the time (late 1950's to early 1960's) affecting the family.

160813,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,080010482X,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","Some stories leaves a great impression on you and this is one of them. The 1961 film version of ""A Raisin in the Sun"" reassembled the stage cast, with leading actors Claudia McNeil, Ruby Dee and Diana Sands as well as Poitier. The plays black director was replaced by Columbia Pictures with a white one, but Hansberry wrote the screenplay adaptation of her own work, saying, ""Nobody's going to turn this thing into a minstrel show"" (Goudsouzian). Hansberry originally toughened the plays script, adding scenes that emphasized the hopelessness of the ghetto environment, for example, one in which Mama Younger's is overcharged while shopping at an inner-city supermarket and one that shows Walter Lee seeking advice from a white store owner about opening his own business and misinterpreting the businessman's personal frustrations as racism. Columbia rejected this material, as well as eliminating black slang like ""bread"" for ""money,"" saying that additional polarizing issues lessened the white audience's sympathy for the Younger family. The studio was cautious, because bringing the play to the screen was a financial risk, since there would be no bookings, and no revenue, from the South.Both the play and later the film version of ""A Raisin in the Sun"" came at a critical time for black Americans. ""In 1960, Negroes were quietly asking for their rights. By 1969, blacks were demanding them. The decade moved from the traditional goal of cultural and academic assimilation to one of almost absolute separatism and the evolution of a black cultural aesthetic"" (Bogle). Some critics viewed the play as a ""soap opera made successful by American's collective guilt over the Negro Question"" (Mapp). But Hansberry's goal was to write about ""honest to God, believable, many-sided people who happen to be Negroes"" (Leab).The play touched on universal themes: ""marital and generational discord, conformity vs. respect for diversity, struggle for women's rights, idealism vs. cynicism, dangers of misdirected ambition and religion vs. atheistic humanism"" (Stevens). Mama Younger rules her family with a potent form of passive aggressive love, smothering her family with her affection, but perhaps failing to teach them how to make independent decisions, precipitating a family crisis. Issues of self-improvement, education, Afro-centrism, parenting, and intra-family bullying releases, in turn, each family member's bottled up rage. The themes in A Raisin in the Sun still resonate, as black Americans continue to search for a middle ground between African heritage and slave-descendant personal histories, and to decide how much to either ""assimilate"" or to reject the values of white society.In his autobiography, Producer Philip Rose wrote of Hansberry, ""she was brilliant, perceptive, incredibly articulate, well-informed in the literature of the theater, and certainly freely expressive of her very strong opinions.""  Both the stage and screen versions of ""A Raisin in the Sun"" were turning points in the way African Americans were portrayed: they appeared, for the first time, as three-dimensional human beings. The dialogue and issues that are discussed reinstate the values upon which America was built. I strongly recommend this excellent film.",5,Great American Classic,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,3247,"['stories', 'great', 'impression', 'one', '1961', 'film', 'version', 'A', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'reassembled', 'stage', 'cast', 'leading', 'actors', 'Claudia', 'McNeil', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'Diana', 'Sands', 'as', 'well', 'Poitier', 'plays', 'black', 'director', 'was', 'replaced', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'white', 'one', 'Hansberry', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'own', 'work', 'saying', 'Nobody', 'going', 'turn', 'thing', 'minstrel', 'show', 'Goudsouzian', 'Hansberry', 'originally', 'toughened', 'plays', 'script', 'adding', 'scenes', 'emphasized', 'hopelessness', 'ghetto', 'environment', 'example', 'one', 'Mama', 'Younger', 'overcharged', 'shopping', 'inner-city', 'supermarket', 'one', 'Walter', 'Lee', 'seeking', 'advice', 'white', 'store', 'owner', 'opening', 'own', 'business', 'misinterpreting', 'businessman', 'personal', 'frustrations', 'racism', 'Columbia', 'rejected', 'material', 'as', 'well', 'eliminating', 'black', 'slang', 'bread', 'money', 'saying', 'additional', 'polarizing', 'issues', 'lessened', 'white', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'Younger', 'family', 'studio', 'was', 'cautious', 'bringing', 'play', 'screen', 'was', 'financial', 'risk', 'would', 'be', 'bookings', 'revenue', 'South.Both', 'play', 'later', 'film', 'version', 'A', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'came', 'critical', 'time', 'black', 'Americans', '1960', 'Negroes', 'were', 'quietly', 'asking', 'rights', '1969', 'blacks', 'were', 'demanding', 'decade', 'moved', 'traditional', 'goal', 'cultural', 'academic', 'assimilation', 'one', 'almost', 'absolute', 'separatism', 'evolution', 'black', 'cultural', 'aesthetic', 'Bogle', 'critics', 'viewed', 'play', 'soap', 'opera', 'made', 'successful', 'American', 'collective', 'guilt', 'Negro', 'Question', 'Mapp', 'Hansberry', 'goal', 'was', 'write', 'honest', 'God', 'believable', 'many-sided', 'people', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'Negroes', 'Leab', '.The', 'play', 'touched', 'universal', 'themes', 'marital', 'generational', 'discord', 'conformity', 'vs.', 'respect', 'diversity', 'struggle', 'women', 'rights', 'idealism', 'vs.', 'cynicism', 'dangers', 'misdirected', 'ambition', 'religion', 'vs.', 'atheistic', 'humanism', 'Stevens', 'Mama', 'Younger', 'rules', 'family', 'potent', 'form', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'love', 'smothering', 'family', 'affection', 'perhaps', 'failing', 'teach', 'how', 'make', 'independent', 'decisions', 'precipitating', 'family', 'crisis', 'Issues', 'self-improvement', 'education', 'Afro-centrism', 'parenting', 'intra-family', 'bullying', 'releases', 'turn', 'family', 'member', 'bottled', 'up', 'rage', 'themes', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'still', 'resonate', 'black', 'Americans', 'continue', 'search', 'middle', 'ground', 'African', 'heritage', 'slave-descendant', 'personal', 'histories', 'decide', 'how', 'much', 'assimilate', 'reject', 'values', 'white', 'society.In', 'autobiography', 'Producer', 'Philip', 'Rose', 'wrote', 'Hansberry', 'was', 'brilliant', 'perceptive', 'incredibly', 'articulate', 'well-informed', 'literature', 'theater', 'certainly', 'freely', 'expressive', 'very', 'strong', 'opinions', 'stage', 'screen', 'versions', 'A', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'were', 'turning', 'points', 'way', 'African', 'Americans', 'were', 'portrayed', 'appeared', 'first', 'time', 'three-dimensional', 'human', 'beings', 'dialogue', 'issues', 'are', 'discussed', 'reinstate', 'values', 'America', 'was', 'built', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A

160823,A319KYEIAZ3SON,080010482X,Mary Whipple,"[36, 37]","With perhaps the best cast ever assembled for this play, David Susskind's 1961 production of Raisin in the Sun is a classic film and a landmark achievement during the civil rights struggles of the early 1960s.  Starring a young Sidney Poitier as Walter Lee, Claudia McNeil as his mother Lena Younger, Ruby Dee as his wife Ruth, and Diana Sands as his sister Beneatha, the film closely follows the script of the play, and director Daniel Petrie wisely confines the setting almost entirely to one room, as it is on stage.  This intensifies the emotions and interactions of this three-generation family, which share a small, two-bedroom apartment in South Chicago, and makes their longing to break free obvious both visually and emotionally.Sidney Poitier as Walter Lee is the &quot;giant...surrounded by ants&quot; as he dreams of escaping his job as a chauffeur and investing in a liquor store. Poitier's body language and subtle gestures as he argues about how to spend his mother's ten thousand dollar life insurance check powerfully convey his anguish.  The close-up of Poitier's slow transition from an insolent and angry young man to a tearful and repentant son in one scene with his mother is unforgettable.  Claudia McNeil, as the mother, is stalwart, strong, and full of pride.  Ruby Dee, as the devoted wife, trying to decide whether to have an abortion in order to lighten her husband's load, is simultaneously resolute and resigned.  Diana Sands, as Beneatha, the agnostic medical student, reflecting the beginning of the &quot;Roots&quot; and &quot;Black Power&quot; movements, provides some comic relief as she practices African &quot;home-from-the-hunt&quot; dances.At the heart of the play is the issue of discrimination against black people and the limitations on their dreams, and the filming in black and white is appropriate.  The small dying houseplant that Lena nurtures remains the major symbol here, as it is in the play, but through the cinematography new symbols emerge.  The kitchen cupboard door opens and shuts as family members open and shut themselves to each other and the outside world, and numerous scenes take place between two people with a door in the background, opening and closing as their emotions change.  The film quality and its high contrast have withstood the test of time, the sound is good, and the acting, especially as revealed in the close-ups, makes this a classic film, better than any stage version I have ever seen or imagined.

160827,ATSWIYN2BJDVP,080010482X,Movie and Music lover!,"[3, 3]","I just finished watching this spectacular movie, A Raisin In The Sun. My eyes are still moist from the tears...I will not ruin your viewing of this spectacular piece of film by telling the story, but I will outline some facts:This movie chronicles the basic dilemma of life which is: whether a person's skin is white, black, purple or green, a person wants to have dignity in their life and to have a place of their own to call home. That is the driving force behind this movie. Angst and drama is present on a daily basis as the characters discuss life, money, family and death. Metaphors and symbolism abound throughout the production. Even though the movie plays out primarily on one set (an apartment in the projects of Chicago), the viewer does not get the feeling of being closed in or claustrophoic. On the contrary, the dreams of the family are so big that they over-flow outside the walls of their small and dingy apartment.Mama, (Claudia McNeal) who was the matriarch and the backbone of the family was my favorite character. She was unbelieveable! Her worry over her family was metaphored in the plant that she constantly fussed over. What an amazing woman.Sidney Poitier was... I cannot find the words.

160832,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,080010482X,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","A Raisin in the Sun(released May/61)consists of an all star black cast,that simply crackles with the vibrancy and immediacy of the actors and the tension that is created between the various characters.The film has the feel of its stage origins,and the cast that of an ensemble as sure as the characters they portray. I recall seeing it way back when upon its release and it certainly made for an uncomfortable feeling.All star black casts of this quality were few and far between in those days and the message portrayed in it was powerful and to the point.Sure it looked at the black culture and its foibles but it also cast a big light on the racist white to black aspect of things which was bound to make any middle class person of the Caucasian persuasion more than a little uncomfortable.This was the early 60s don't forget.There were a combination of messages for both cultures in the picture and the blend of both was seamless.Most of the action takes place in and around the apartment lived in by a hard working mother,Lena Younger(Claudia McNeil),whose years of back breaking work and worry are carved into her face.Living in this small apartment are her son Walter(Sidney Poitier),his wife Beneatha(Diana Sands)and their son Stephen,along with Walter's sister Ruth(Ruby Dee,real life wife of the late Ossie Davis).Day to day existence is hard because Mom is the only one with a steady income,son Walter is a daydreamer full of ideas and nothing much else and they are all in each others faces day in and day out.Walter and Beneatha's marriage has suffered greatly and both are in a rut.Along comes a scheme from one of Walter's buddies at the bar to go into the liquor business and open a store.It sounds sure fire and Walter lays down a good deal of Moms savings.Mom in the meantime has put a down payment on an inexpensive home in a white neighbourhood.Everything is looking up with the family until news comes in that Walter's future business partner has absconded with all the cash.All are devastated and it affects each in a different way.This was Walters ticket up and out of his problems which have all come crashing down on his head.This was a chance for Mom to have a better feel about her son and a better life for both of her children.This was Beneatha's chance at a new and better improved Walter/marriage.Thrown into this cauldron of wildly conflicting tension is a rep from the white neighbourhood they are moving to.He at first seems to be a one man welcoming committee of sorts until his real reasons come to the fore,which include buying out the family so they do not move in.After he leaves they are at first indignant but do to the money woes,his offer is very tempting.The tight family continues its bitter squabbling until Walter finally realizes how far he has sunk and swallows his petty pride.He starts to rebuild himself and his marriage from the bottom up and has the obvious pride of his mother behind him.They vow to move despite their woes and hold their collective heads up high...together,as a family.Each actor has his moments to shine.Poitier is the easiest to pick out as his was and still is the name with the most star power,but I did not see any actor within this film fall short at any point in keeping that tension and dynamic on an even keel.Looking back after so many years it's hard to imagine today a film like that not receiving some form of Academy recognition.It didn't and I have heard every explanation I think there is,from Hollywood's shortsightedness to its prejudice.The truth is part and all of it at the same time.However time has not diminished the power of the actors herein,the play or the film overall.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a w/s a/r of 1:85:1,in b&w; of course.Along with production notes there are talent files and its trailer.This is a film not to be missed.Rarely does a film stand out as a small testament of its time and still have relevance after all these years.Some would say the battle is still being fought,I will leave that up to you,dear reader,to decide for yourself.Highly recommended.",5,Devestatingly Powerful!,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,4101,"['Raisin', 'Sun', 'released', 'May/61', 'star', 'black', 'cast', 'simply', 'vibrancy', 'immediacy', 'actors', 'tension', 'created', 'various', 'characters.The', 'film', 'feel', 'stage', 'origins', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'as', 'sure', 'characters', 'portray', 'recall', 'seeing', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'upon', 'release', 'certainly', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling.All', 'star', 'black', 'casts', 'quality', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'days', 'message', 'portrayed', 'was', 'powerful', 'point.Sure', 'looked', 'black', 'culture', 'foibles', 'also', 'cast', 'big', 'light', 'racist', 'white', 'black', 'aspect', 'things', 'was', 'bound', 'make', 'middle', 'class', 'person', 'Caucasian', 'persuasion', 'more', 'little', 'uncomfortable.This', 'was', 'early', '60s', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget.There', 'were', 'combination', 'messages', 'cultures', 'picture', 'blend', 'was', 'seamless.Most', 'action', 'place', 'apartment', 'lived', 'hard', 'working', 'mother', 'Lena', 'Younger', 'Claudia', 'McNeil', 'years', 'back', 'breaking', 'work', 'worry', 'are', 'carved', 'face.Living', 'small', 'apartment', 'are', 'son', 'Walter', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'wife', 'Beneatha', 'Diana', 'Sands', 'son', 'Stephen', 'Walter', 'sister', 'Ruth', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'late', 'Ossie', 'Davis', '.Day', 'day', 'existence', 'hard', 'Mom', 'only', 'one', 'steady', 'income', 'son', 'Walter', 'daydreamer', 'full', 'ideas', 'nothing', 'much', 'else', 'are', 'others', 'day', 'day', 'out.Walter', 'Beneatha', 'marriage', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'are', 'rut.Along', 'scheme', 'one', 'Walter', 'buddies', 'bar', 'go', 'liquor', 'business', 'open', 'store.It', 'sure', 'fire', 'Walter', 'lays', 'down', 'good', 'deal', 'Moms', 'savings.Mom', 'meantime', 'put', 'down', 'payment', 'inexpensive', 'home', 'white', 'neighbourhood.Everything', 'looking', 'up', 'family', 'news', 'Walter', 'future', 'business', 'partner', 'absconded', 'cash.All', 'are', 'devastated', 'different', 'way.This', 'was', 'Walters', 'ticket', 'up', 'problems', 'have', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'head.This', 'was', 'chance', 'Mom', 'have', 'better', 'feel', 'son', 'better', 'life', 'children.This', 'was', 'Beneatha', 'chance', 'new', 'better', 'improved', 'Walter/marriage.Thrown', 'cauldron', 'wildly', 'conflicting', 'tension', 'rep', 'white', 'neighbourhood', 'are', 'moving', 'to.He', 'first', 'be', 'one', 'man', 'welcoming', 'committee', 'sorts', 'real', 'reasons', 'come', 'fore', 'include', 'buying', 'out', 'family', 'do', 'not', 'move', 'in.After', 'are', 'first', 'indignant', 'do', 'money', 'woes', 'offer', 'very', 'tempting.The', 'tight', 'family', 'bitter', 'squabbling', 'Walter', 'finally', 'how', 'far', 'sunk', 'petty', 'pride.He', 'rebuild', 'marriage', 'bottom', 'up', 'obvious', 'pride', 'mother', 'him.They', 'vow', 'move', 'woes', 'hold', 'collective', 'heads', 'up', 'high', 'together', 'family.Each', 'actor', 'moments', 'shine.Poitier', 'easiest', 'pick', 'out', 'was', 'still', 'name', 'most', 'star', 'power', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'actor', 'film', 'fall', 'short', 'point', 'keeping', 'tension', 'dynamic', 'even', 'keel.Looking', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'hard', 'imagine', 'today', 'film', 'not', 'receiving', 'form', 'Academy', 'recognition.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heard', 'explanation', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'shortsightedness', 'prejudice.The', 'truth', 'part', 'same', 'time.However', 'time', 'not', 'diminished', 'power', 'actors', 'herein', 'play', 'film', 'overall.Technically', 'speaking', 'film', 'clear', 'crisp', 'w/s', 'a/r', '1:85:1', 'b', 'w', 'course.Along', 'production', 'notes', 'are', 'talent', 'files', 'trailer.This', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Rarely', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'small', 'testament', 'time', 'still', 'have', 'relevance', 'years.Some', 'would', 'say', 'battle', 'still', 'being', 'fought', 'will', 'leave', 'up', 'dear', 'reader', 'decide', 'yourself.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

While it is set at a specific time and place--the turbulence of the late 50's in Chicago--the themes are universal.

John Fiedler's milquetoast persona makes his words so much more sinister than John Stamos's.  Stamos is wonderful, but the contrast between Fiedler and Poitier, especially their sizes, makes the power of the white character's words much more frightening.My college freshman all connect fully to this film, even though these people are not very like themselves, nor is the neighborhood much like their mid-Missouri town life.

Everyone in this film has them, but the question is, do they ever come true? Do you have to put that dream on hold because of other circumstances beyond your control, until it consumes you to do something unthinkable? Or in order to reach that dream you want to come true so badly, you decide to take another route to get it? Or you just let it die, and you are forever regretting not taking the necessary steps to make that dreams a reality?I first saw this on television umpteen years ago and in school, and I was touched by the whole plot. In the 1950s, an African-American family living in a Chicago tenement obtains a large amount of money from an insurance policy due to the death of the patriarch, and his widow (Claudia McNeil) decides to use a large portion of it as a down payment on a home in the suburbs, which is a thrill to everyone in the family, except her petulant son Walter Lee (Sidney Poitier). Walter Lee has dreams of his own, and wants the insurance money for another purpose.Walter Lee's headstrong, witty and socially conscious younger sister, Beneatha (Diana Sands), is a college student who has dreams of going to medical school and becoming a doctor and in the meanwhile, trying desperately to identify with her African roots after meeting a Nigerian exchange student (Ivan Dixon). This is a major ingredient in the script, being that this was written shortly after the birth of the Civil Rights Movement, several years before the Black Panthers were formed and at least 15 years before the women's liberation movement. Will she ever get there? Meanwhile, Walter Lee and his mother continuously clash until his mother finally breaks down and gives him a portion of the money, but she is very careful about how she wants him to use it.Meanwhile, the residents of the white suburban neighborhood where this family wants to move don't want them there. Later on, a decision must be made. Should they move to this beautiful new home where they aren't really wanted, or take the white neighbors up on their offer to buy the house back from them with a profit?The entire cast, which is the original Broadway ensemble, is stellar, especially Claudia McNeil's amazing portrayal of the widowed Lena Younger, Walter Lee's mother. She is nothing short of phenomenal - she is a proud woman, a tower of strength in the face of tragedy and although she herself is suffering, she is able to put her own grief aside to comfort the other family members. This is clearly Sidney Poitier's finest role, right up there with playing Virgil Tibbs in 1967's ""In The Heat of the Night"". Exploding with intensity, he accurately nails down the frustrations and pain of a black man who wants for much more for himself and his family, and pins his hopes on an unyielding dream. Ruby Dee plays Ruth, Walter Lee's wife, a beautiful woman of quiet dignity who is struggling with conflicts of her own. Also appearing in his first movie role is future Oscar winner Louis Gossett, Jr. as George Murchison, an articulate and well-to-do college student.This is still a relevant  topic today, even though this film was made over 40 years ago because these  things are still happening. Lorraine Hansberry, the playwright, was inspired to write this masterpiece by her own experience of moving to an all-white Chicago suburb as a child, and the very public genrification story of entertainer Nat King  Cole, who faced the same kind of bigotry when he brought a house in  a wealthy white neighborhood in California in 1948.Wonderful family  film.
