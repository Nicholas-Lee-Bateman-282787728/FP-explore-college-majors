Now that both Jerry and Chester have passed on, maybe someone will get some more material out there for us to enjoy. With all of the TV and concert work Jerry performed, its a crime we don't have more material of his available to us on DVD.",5,Two of the Best!,1220659200,"09 6, 2008",2008,357,"['such', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'Jerry', 'Chet', 'were', 'none', 'other', 'music', 'inspiring', 'fun', 'Now', 'Jerry', 'Chester', 'have', 'passed', 'maybe', 'someone', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'material', 'enjoy', 'TV', 'concert', 'work', 'Jerry', 'performed', 'crime', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'material', 'available', 'DVD']",Chet Atkins & Jerry Reed In Concert

Hedges,"[2, 2]","If only there was more musicianship of this caliber around today I would listen to far more contemporary music, but Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed had few equals, and there's even fewer around now. This concert from The Bottom Line in 1992 is absolutely brilliant. The music is first rate, and the guitar work is something to behold (especially if you're a guitarist yourself) with Jerry in particular playing masterfully. I love the musical selection, but gravitate toward the boisterous Reed. There's an interesting choice of music here, and it's all good. I was particularly fond of Jerry's version of Bob Dylan's &#34;Don't Think Twice It's Alright.&#34; Chet's beautiful &#34;I Still Can't Say Goodbye&#34; is another highlight, and shows off Chet's quite gentlemanly mannerism better than most any other number.Throughout the entire show the casual exuberance these two old friends shared as they played is a mesmerizing delight to watch (I love Jerry trying to get his guitar plugged in, for example, and Chet in search of a capo.)  I am a fan of both these men, and as guitarists they were perfectly matched. Anyone who loves music should watch this concert with all due haste.",5,Jerry Reed And Chet Atkins: Two Guitarists Without Peer,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1181,"['only', 'was', 'more', 'musicianship', 'caliber', 'today', 'would', 'listen', 'far', 'more', 'contemporary', 'music', 'Chet', 'Atkins', 'Jerry', 'Reed', 'had', 'few', 'equals', 'even', 'fewer', 'around', 'now', 'concert', 'Bottom', 'Line', '1992', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'music', 'first', 'rate', 'guitar', 'work', 'something', 'behold', 'especially', ""'re"", 'guitarist', 'yourself', 'Jerry', 'particular', 'playing', 'masterfully', 'love', 'musical', 'selection', 'gravitate', 'boisterous', 'Reed', 'interesting', 'choice', 'music', 'here', 'good', 'was', 'particularly', 'fond', 'Jerry', 'version', 'Bob', 'Dylan', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Think', 'Twice', 'Alright.', '34', 'Chet', 'beautiful', '34', 'Still', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Goodbye', '34', 'highlight', 'off', 'Chet', 'quite', 'gentlemanly', 'mannerism', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'entire', 'show', 'casual', 'exuberance', 'two', 'old', 'friends', 'shared', 'played', 'mesmerizing', 'delight', 'watch', 'love', 'Jerry', 'trying', 'get', 'guitar', 'plugged', 'example', 'Chet', 'search', 'capo', 'am', 'fan', 'men', 'guitarists', 'were', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'Anyone', 'who', 'music', 'should', 'watch', 'concert', 'due', 'haste']",Chet Atkins & Jerry Reed In Concert

So mild and easy going and seemed so nice. And will always be given the credit as a GREAT guitar picker, of any and all genres.  Jerry, on the other hand, I don't think has nearly the recognition that he deserves.  He's proven over and over that he's right up there with Chet.  These albums with Chet attest to that fact.  Let someone please recognize him and elect him into the CMHOF while he is still alive.  I am in the throes (it's difficult) of reading that book about Elvis (Careless Love, by Peter Guralnick).  In it, Elvis wants to record ""Guitar Man"".  But he nor his back-ups can get it right.  The way Jerry did it. (Well, what did they expect? Jerry wrote the darn song.)  So someone says ""you've just got to get Jerry to come and do it himself"".  So he has his ""people"" call Jerry to come to the studio and record it with him.  Elvis is thrilled to death.  It was just as he wanted it to be.  After it's done, Kernel (Yes the ""korny kernel"" as I call him.  He was NOT a Colonel. That title has to be earned).  Anyhow, Kernel and his people try to badger Jerry into giving them publishing/copyrights to the song, or selling to them.  Jerry stood his ground.  They weren't getting it.  And they shouldn't have called him off of his fishing trip to begin with.  If they had just told him in the beginning what the deal was that they wanted, he wouldn't have wasted their time.  GOOD for Jerry.  I guess up to that point, Elvis had always gotten what he wanted.  Not this time.  JERRY BELONGS IN THE COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME with Chet and the others.",5,Chet & Jerry = 2 geniuses,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,1664,"['Even', 'Chet', 'passed', 'think', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'class', 'person', 'was', 'mild', 'easy', 'going', 'seemed', 'so', 'nice', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'GREAT', 'guitar', 'picker', 'genres', 'Jerry', 'other', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'nearly', 'recognition', 'proven', 'right', 'there', 'Chet', 'albums', 'Chet', 'attest', 'fact', 'Let', 'someone', 'please', 'recognize', 'elect', 'CMHOF', 'still', 'alive', 'am', 'throes', 'difficult', 'reading', 'book', 'Elvis', 'Careless', 'Love', 'Peter', 'Guralnick', 'Elvis', 'record', 'Guitar', 'Man', 'back-ups', 'can', 'get', 'right', 'way', 'Jerry', 'did', 'Well', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'Jerry', 'wrote', 'darn', 'song', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'just', 'got', 'get', 'Jerry', 'come', 'do', 'people', 'call', 'Jerry', 'come', 'studio', 'record', 'Elvis', 'thrilled', 'death', 'was', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'done', 'Kernel', 'Yes', 'korny', 'kernel', 'call', 'was', 'NOT', 'Colonel', 'title', 'be', 'earned', 'Anyhow', 'Kernel', 'people', 'try', 'badger', 'Jerry', 'giving', 'publishing/copyrights', 'song', 'selling', 'Jerry', 'stood', 'ground', 'were', ""n't"", 'getting', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'called', 'fishing', 'trip', 'begin', 'had', 'just', 'told', 'beginning', 'what', 'deal', 'was', 'wanted', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'wasted', 'time', 'GOOD', 'Jerry', 'guess', 'up', 'point', 'Elvis', 'had', 'always', 'gotten', 'what', 'wanted', 'Not', 'time', 'JERRY', 'BELONGS', 'IN', 'THE', 'COUNTRY', 'MUSIC', 'HALL', 'OF', 'FAME', 'Chet', 'others']",Chet Atkins & Jerry Reed In Concert
