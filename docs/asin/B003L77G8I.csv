1351370,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B003L77G8I,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[13, 18]","Bones: The Complete Sixth Seasonbegan awkwardly; after an uncomfortable romantic rejection by Tempe (which she reversed herself on, too late), Booth surprised her by introducing a girlfriend, embarking on a hot and heavy relationship with globe-trotting journalist, Hannah Burley (Katheryn Winnick)...while this plot device was intended to create new sparks and tension between the leads (not a bad idea in a very long-running series), the chemistry between Hannah and Booth wasn't there, the sparks weren't there, and truthfully, the over-padded 7-episode story arc was one of the most disappointing of the show's history (even the murders seemed routine!) The saving grace was the often funny, occasionally tragic, and always believable subplot between Angela and Hodgins, as they impatiently waited on their baby. Kudos on timing the pregnancy out; too often, on series television (unless a star is actually 'with child'), the time between the discovery and the delivery is only the length of time between 'sweeps'...here, we watched the development, physically and emotionally, of Angela, shared their heartache over a potential genetic defect that could leave their baby blind, enjoyed Hogkins actually standing up to her rockin' daddy (ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons)...Michaela Conlin and T.J. Thyne were, to me, the saving grace of the first part of the season.HOWEVER, when Hannah served Booth her walking papers (refusing to marry him), ""Bones"" IMMEDIATELY jumped into high gear (with the exception of the 'groanable' 'crossover' episode/pilot of new series, ""Finder"", which shouldn't have aired, even if both series have the same producer)...The cases got far more interesting, the sexual chemistry between Booth and Brennan resumed without a hitch, a truly frightening, lethal opponent to Booth (fellow sniper Jacob Broadsky, played by the wonderfully wicked Arnold Vosloo, of the ""Mummy"" series), initiated one of the most shocking, unexpected plot-twists, ever, and the finale offered a 1-2 punch that caught me totally by surprise! I can't WAIT until next season, the swansong for one of my favorite TV 'families'.While 5-stars may seem too high for some, with the less-than-stellar start to Season Six, the series certainly earned it, with the amazing comeback it made...And now on to the Grand Finale!",5,"An Off-Kilter Start, But a Magical Finale!",1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,2310,"['Bones', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Seasonbegan', 'awkwardly', 'uncomfortable', 'romantic', 'rejection', 'Tempe', 'reversed', 'too', 'late', 'Booth', 'surprised', 'introducing', 'girlfriend', 'embarking', 'hot', 'heavy', 'relationship', 'globe-trotting', 'journalist', 'Hannah', 'Burley', 'Katheryn', 'Winnick', 'plot', 'device', 'was', 'intended', 'create', 'new', 'sparks', 'tension', 'leads', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'very', 'long-running', 'series', 'chemistry', 'Hannah', 'Booth', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'sparks', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'truthfully', 'over-padded', '7-episode', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'disappointing', 'show', 'history', 'even', 'murders', 'seemed', 'routine', 'saving', 'grace', 'was', 'often', 'funny', 'occasionally', 'tragic', 'always', 'believable', 'subplot', 'Angela', 'Hodgins', 'impatiently', 'waited', 'baby', 'Kudos', 'timing', 'pregnancy', 'out', 'too', 'often', 'series', 'television', 'star', 'actually', ""'with"", 'child', 'time', 'discovery', 'delivery', 'only', 'length', 'time', ""'sweeps"", 'here', 'watched', 'development', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'Angela', 'shared', 'heartache', 'potential', 'genetic', 'defect', 'could', 'leave', 'baby', 'blind', 'enjoyed', 'Hogkins', 'actually', 'standing', 'up', 'rockin', 'daddy', 'ZZ', 'Top', 'Billy', 'Gibbons', 'Michaela', 'Conlin', 'T.J.', 'Thyne', 'were', 'saving', 'grace', 'first', 'part', 'season.HOWEVER', 'when', 'Hannah', 'served', 'Booth', 'walking', 'papers', 'refusing', 'marry', 'Bones', 'IMMEDIATELY', 'jumped', 'high', 'gear', 'exception', ""'groanable"", 'episode/pilot', 'new', 'series', 'Finder', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'aired', 'even', 'series', 'have', 'same', 'producer', 'cases', 'got', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'Booth', 'Brennan', 'resumed', 'hitch', 'truly', 'frightening', 'lethal', 'opponent', 'Booth', 'fellow', 'sniper', 'Jacob', 'Broadsky', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'wicked', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'Mummy', 'series', 'initiated', 'one', 'most', 'shocking', 'unexpected', 'plot-twists', 'ever', 'finale', 'offered', '1-2', 'punch', 'caught', 'totally', 'surprise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'WAIT', 'next', 'season', 'swansong', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', '5-stars', 'may', 'seem', 'too', 'high', 'less-than-stellar', 'start', 'Season', 'Six', 'series', 'certainly', 'earned', 'amazing', 'comeback', 'made', 'now', 'Grand', 'Finale']",N/A

Marold""","[1, 1]","I have to walk very delicately with what I say about the episodes in this season, since the last two episodes bring an end to a very long ark, which has had its ups and downs since season 1. If you have seen season six, you know of the cliff hanger, which had five of the six team members travelling to far flung corners of the world, for a year. In the hiatus between seasons, the Jeffersonian Medico-Legal Laboratory is transformed into an exhibit for a mastodon, and the one member remaining behind, Camille Saroyan, gets into a jam, and is about to be fired (for no good reason). Our favorite federal prosecutor, Caroline Julian, brings all the team members back to save Cam's bacon.Honestly, I think the rotating ""squinterns"" replacing Zach Addy may just be a bit better than the multi-talented Zach himself (but it would be keen to see him again, maybe once a season, the way Ryan O'Neal is brought back for 1 or 2 episodes per season. The longest arc in the season is Booth's new girlfriend, Hannah, which puts a chill on the possible romantic relation between Booth and Brennan. (This is a technique used before, in the second season, when Brennan hooked up with Booth's FBI colleague, Scully.)Overall, the season does a lot to pump up Booth's capabilities as a sniper. In passing, we get the sense that Booth, like Ian Edgerton in the Numb3rs series, is one of the best snipers in the Bureau, if not in the world. He proves that at least once in this season.One thing which distinguishes this season from others is that it has a spin-off episode, which never resulted in a series.

1351389,A2ZTD6BWSIMQYV,B003L77G8I,"E. Burke ""eburke1""","[11, 16]","The endearing character of Bones, and her singular adherence to the evidence, and denial of any intimate personal relationship is mimicing the legendary character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes.  Holmes could identify a person's profession by looking at them, splashes of mud on a person told him where they had been at a glance, and he could see facts in the most insignificant and mundane bits of evidence. Bones looks at tye bones and unerringly describes the details, much like Holmes.  Watson was the man of action, though most Americans wouldn't understand since over here we have traditionally shown Watson to be an oaf. But Conan Doyle made him a wounded veteran of war, very similar to FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, and Watson, not Holmes, carried the gun. Watson was a man of action, and not the fool hollywood made him in the many lame portrayals of the stories. Watson called Holmes a calculating machine, and like Temerance Brennan, Holmes had his own lab as well.I find the whole series a recreation of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but uniquely and competently modernized to our time, and near worship of science and the military man of action.  The characters are endearing, the relationships active and fluid, and the talent of everyone involved in this series first rate.  I am not being the least bit negative here.  The Sherlock Holmes stories in their day had the popularity of today's Harry Potter, they were a huge and entertaining success for the hords of people, and they remain that to this day for many of us.  It takes serious talent to recreate that, and in this series, they have come very close.This particular episode is wonderful because it exposes the mutual attraction they all feel for each other, their work, and the need to do good and be good.  As Holmes would often say, ""Come Watson, the game's afoot!""  In essence that is how the character of the irrascable District Attorney gets them all to return, she told them in similar fashion, ""the Game's Afoot !"" and they all responded unerringly as did Watson to the call.",4,Temperance Brennan is Sherlock Holmes,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",2010,2079,"['endearing', 'character', 'Bones', 'singular', 'adherence', 'evidence', 'denial', 'intimate', 'personal', 'relationship', 'mimicing', 'legendary', 'character', 'created', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Holmes', 'could', 'identify', 'person', 'profession', 'looking', 'splashes', 'mud', 'person', 'told', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'glance', 'could', 'see', 'facts', 'most', 'insignificant', 'mundane', 'bits', 'evidence', 'Bones', 'tye', 'bones', 'unerringly', 'details', 'much', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'was', 'man', 'action', 'most', 'Americans', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'here', 'have', 'traditionally', 'shown', 'Watson', 'be', 'oaf', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'made', 'wounded', 'veteran', 'war', 'very', 'similar', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Seeley', 'Booth', 'Watson', 'not', 'Holmes', 'carried', 'gun', 'Watson', 'was', 'man', 'action', 'not', 'fool', 'hollywood', 'made', 'many', 'lame', 'portrayals', 'stories', 'Watson', 'called', 'Holmes', 'calculating', 'machine', 'Temerance', 'Brennan', 'Holmes', 'had', 'own', 'lab', 'well.I', 'find', 'whole', 'series', 'recreation', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'stories', 'uniquely', 'competently', 'modernized', 'time', 'worship', 'science', 'military', 'man', 'action', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', 'relationships', 'active', 'fluid', 'talent', 'everyone', 'involved', 'series', 'first', 'rate', 'am', 'not', 'being', 'least', 'bit', 'negative', 'here', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'stories', 'day', 'had', 'popularity', 'today', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'were', 'huge', 'entertaining', 'success', 'hords', 'people', 'remain', 'day', 'many', 'serious', 'talent', 'recreate', 'series', 'have', 'come', 'very', 'close.This', 'particular', 'episode', 'wonderful', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'feel', 'other', 'work', 'need', 'do', 'good', 'be', 'good', 'Holmes', 'would', 'often', 'say', 'Come', 'Watson', 'game', 'afoot', 'essence', 'how', 'character', 'irrascable', 'District', 'Attorney', 'return', 'told', 'similar', 'fashion', 'Game', 'Afoot', 'responded', 'unerringly', 'did', 'Watson', 'call']",N/A

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[28, 28]","- Dr. Brennan reciting the scientist's credo with Professor Bunsen Jude the Science Dude: ""We get the facts and say what's true, because that is what scientists do.""BONES supports the contention that a guy and a girl, especially if they're both hotties, cannot be friends without eventually becoming more than friends. And, yes, this applies even to someone as detached and clinical as the world's foremost forensic anthropologist, Dr. Temperance Brennan. It's BONES' sixth season and, as ever, the sparks fly between our two leads. How cool is that?As we saw in the Season 5 closer, our crime-solving squints have scattered to the winds. FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth has been recalled to active military duty. Dr. Brennan is traipsing thru Indonesia in search of man's true origins. Hodgins and Angela are in France. And the heart-broken Sweets had gone on sabbatical and become a goateed piano player in some bar. It would take seven months and Dr. Cam Saroyan's dire straits at the Jeffersonian Institute to reunite the old gang. The Season Six opener (""The Mastodon in the Room"") reminds us that Bones can still deliver a smackdown as she wipes the jungle floor with a crew of armed guerrilas.Six seasons into it, BONES is still my favorite show on television. I'm still savoring that blend of police procedural, slightly futuristic forensics, terrific humor, and addictive relationship drama. I don't know how the showmakers keep coming up with interesting ways to present the icky corpse. Agent Booth and the squints from the Jeffersonian Institute take on challenging cases, whether it's a homicide victim found in a giant chocolate bar (""The Babe in the Bar"") or one mauled by the mythical chupacabra (""The Truth in the Myth"") or one grounded up in the pin setting machine of a bowling alley (""The Change in the Game"") or melted into the dashboard of an exploded truck (""The Twisted Bones in the Melted Truck"").There are several pivotal episodes. In ""The Mastodon in the Room,"" Booth confesses to Brennan he's in love with a lovely investigative reporter he met during his recent Army tour. This new relationship dynamics would have Brennan reassessing her own feelings for Booth. In ""The Doctor in the Photo,"" Brennan is strangely affected by a murdered cardiac surgeon who resembles Brennan in uncanny ways. This episode would also give us the half-Latin, half-gibberish phrase ""Ipso facto Columbo Oreo,"" which I love. ""The Bullet in the Brain"" features the return of the Gravedigger and introduces this season's recurring big bad, a vigilante sniper from Booth's military past. In the bottle episode ""The Blackout in the Blizzard"" a blizzard cuts off power city-wide and confines Booth and Brennan in an elevator and the squints at the lab while still having to investigate a case involving a potential viral outbreak. ""The Hole in the Heart"" offers the resolution (for now) of Booth's pursuit of the vigilante sniper. ""The Change in the Game"" is the season finale and drops one of those awesome reveals that makes you go ""What the what?!!"" Meanwhile, ""The Signs in the Silence"" may be the most emotional, tearjerky episode of this season as the squints attempt to dig into the past of an abused deaf/mute teenaged girl who may have committed a fatal stabbing.Less pivotal but very fun are ""The Shallow in the Deep,"" which has Booth, Bones, and Sweets ending up on a cougar cruise while following leads to a murder, and ""The Body in the Bounty"" guest-stars David Alan Grier as the ""amazing"" Professor Bunsen Jude ""The Science Dude"" who asks Bones to go on his kid's television science show if he acquits himself well as the intern in her current case. Speaking of which, the oddball cast of rotating ""squinterns"" is back, and it's neat that the show's writers have given them even more back story. I also appreciated that Booth's new girlfriend, Hannah, is treated as a believable character instead of, say, being stereotyped as the predictable witch. I like that Hannah and Bones - and, for that matter, Hannah and Booth's young son - are good friends.In Emily Deschanel's hands, Dr. Temperance Brennan continues to be a wonderful character. Bones is still socially awkward, still unfailingly blunt, is at all times literal. But she's still trying. And she's progressed far enough that she's even trying to crack jokes (bad jokes, excruciatingly unfunny jokes, but that's not the point). Deschanel allows you to see the painful vulnerability in Bones and the heart beneath the icy, abrasive surface. Deschanel and Boreanaz's chemistry continues to be unbeatable. For those who've been keening for progress in the ""Will they, won't they?"" department, several episodes address this concern.Six discs to this complete Season 6 Collection containing all 23 episodes. Bonus stuff as follows:- Audio Commentary on 2 episodes: ""The Doctor in the Photo"" (with Hart Hanson, Stephen Nathan and Jan Toynton) and ""The Blackout in the Blizzard"" (with David Boreanaz and

1351400,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B003L77G8I,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","To resuscitate a dead team out of their scattered disappearance is not an easy task. Luckily the DA in Washington DC is a powerful woman, stubborn and resolute, and she generally gets what she wants. So she brought Agent Booth back from Afghanistan, and Temperance Brennan, aka Bones, from the exotic place where she was trying to get some archaeologically interesting bones with Daisy, Dr Sweet's girl friend, and Dr Sweet from his hideout somewhere in Paris where he was having a showbiz career as a cabaret singer. They all come back, change clothes and back in the business in a jiffy they all are. Angela and Dr Hodgins are also back though from not so far away and Angela is pregnant. Don't worry the delivery will go just fine, and their fear of some handicap will be unfounded. They will celebrate at the end of the season.But this season is a lot more interesting than just those circumstantial collateral disagreements or pleasure.As usual one case per episode, clean and neat, always dealing with a lot of bones, gross and dirty, soaked in a lot of decomposed muck with a tremendous number of maggots, worms and other corpse parasites. A series not to watch while eating anything more delicate than dry cookies.The interest is first the relations among the people in the series and these relations include some personal data on each case. Dr Saroyan has the case of her daughter to solve who is supposed to start her college years. The mother cannot cope with the idea of her following her boyfriend to some community college in some county of some northern New England state nearly in Canada but is it ethical to cheat the system and get her accepted in Columbia University, if it is Columbia University (you can check that one out), on a fake file? It is amazing what parents are at times ready to do that is so absurd and goes against the grain of their profession and personality. Will the girl accept to enter a top university on a fake file? That is the real question. Will the daughter teach a lesson to her own mother? Not so simple.Of course Angela and Dr Hodgins have a full plate with the pregnancy and the delivery of the baby. For them that's enough and that will require some help from a friendly psychiatrist because it is hard for the father not to become overprotective and it is hard for the mother to accept the physical handicap this pregnancy may represent. Yet they decided that working with the people they are used to work and live with was the best thing for the pregnancy, the mother and the child. Angela was not alone at any moment of her days or nights.Agent Booth brought a journalist back from Afghanistan, a sort of love substitute for Temperance. But will that not cause some problems, like conflicting interests between the two professions? And Booth with his own son is already very busy in life. Will that new woman in the picture be able to cope with a child, what's more the child of another woman? And the question of marriage will come up sooner or later and how are the two going to react to that eventuality? Probably not very well, maybe not too bad. A decision that is always difficult to take for someone who is constantly in the field of police investigation and for a journalist just back from a war zone and who may consider Washington DC as another war zone. Do you get married and build a home and a family when you are in a war zone?There is of course the case of Booth and Temperance. It did not work the first time, but will there be a second time? Why not? They are both young enough to think about their independence and old enough to start thinking about settling down in some kind of normal place. But of course Booth is not free and temperance is mature enough to keep up appearances.Then you have the interns still rotating, the four of them. They are the surprise of each episode because they are so different and they can be so funny, though at times they are just funny for us because they are mismatched with what is happening around them, but that's what interns are all about. Unluckily one will end up very badly. That's not the first case, but so far none had ended up that badly. But a song will carry him through: lime and coconut, sung in a chorus all together, mellow and heart stirring.There will be a case that will run over the whole season, the case of a sniper who had been a colleague and friend of Booth in Afghanistan and who came back slightly berserk and decided that what he did over there was good enough for the USA too and he started killing those who were rotten, and those who were in his way for his type of justice and these were only collateral victims for him, hence justified by the end. It will take the whole team to stop him and it will bring a lot of suffering and even mourning to that team.Then there are 23 cases in this season and I would advise you to watch them if you haven't yet or watch them again if you have already.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Even the bones are delicious,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,4955,"['resuscitate', 'dead', 'team', 'scattered', 'disappearance',

1351405,AM0Q2JUS910ZQ,B003L77G8I,"JEROME W, MARTIN","[0, 1]","This season 6 is perhaps my favorite one because we finally learn how Dr Brennan really feels about Booth.  In THE DOCTOR IN THE PHOTO She confesses to Booth she made a big mistake in not getting together with him when he asked her to.  This was one of the mystical weird episodes whereshe is apparently affected by some drugs in a tree with the body of a female doctor and sees herself in the photo of the doctor.  Again, Booth rescuesher from getting killed.  I have great admiration for Emily D. as an actress as well as being one of the most beautiful women (with Zooey) that I haveever seen.  Her Acting is superb, very realistic, and she touches my heart in a way no other female has done.  Her tears really move me.  I empathizewith Brennan and Booth because my childhood had some bumps in the road.  I often was alone and turned to reading, mainly history and science and Inever new my biological father.  So I understand her struggles on her own.  The splendid production values enhance the good stories in the 6th season as well as the other Seasons , all of which I got from Amazon.  And those who have seen all the episodes in this set, especially disc 6 know that theyfinally ""make it"". Yea!!At the beginning Booth & Brennan return from overseas to return to crime fighting.  Brennan learns, however, Booth has a new girl friend named Hannah; reasonably good looking but with a big nose.  No, I did not like her.  Bones tried hard to be friends with her and tried not to spoil theirrelationship, but clearly she was not happy about it.  Anyhow, it broke up because she did not want to get married.  Booth threw the ring away (DUMB!)in a pond and that was that.There are other good stories in this set, though someone seems to keep giving Sweets roles: I do not like this pompous, snobby, yuppie man-child and wish he would marry Dippy Daisy run off somewhere.  I do think eventually everyone is going to get married, even Sweety-pie.  Maybe time will make Sweets better, but I would never give him a weapon, not even a pea shooter!I love Hodgins & Angela, both very likeable and well played by their respective actors/actresses.  Camille is excellent (and beautiful) along withWendel and the other intern actors.  David B., of course, is excellent: really comes off believeably as a FBI cop.  Oh yeah, I don't care much for the character Daisy: Her constant yapping drives me up the wall.  NOTE: if  Brennan becomes President, pls tap her phone!In conclusion I think this is the best show on Television bar none.  though I am a bit uncomfortable with all the sex talk, still it has to rankof one of the best all around TV shows in the history of entertainment.  One of the best casting jobs ever, realistic acting, relatively accuratescience and lots of humour.  Everyone seems capable of comedy when wanted and they all LOOK GOOD, especially the women (hubba!).

I was a fan of Kathy Reich's books and lets face it, Emily looks nothing like the character.  She seemed too glamorous and elegant! And the setting was out of whack, not at all like the books.  But I quickly became a fan!  The ensemble cast works well together and seems to me to be friends, which adds to the cachet.  I like it that one time characters ended up a semi permanent part of the story line, reappearing often.  And I found Temperance's quirks endearing...I've done the manuscript work for PHD's and know how they can be!  That she is so beautiful and glamorous and has these single minded quirks makes her fun to watch.  The other characters story lines are developed so watching a show is like catching up with a bunch of friends, but with a good story thrown in as well. I've gotten every one of the series, and when I can no longer see it on tv, I'll have it to revist again and again.  I'm not fond of many of the 'hot' programs and tend to buy up series I like so I can go back and enjoy them (LIFE and LOST being two in question).
