No, there wasn't any sex or violence, but it was still exciting.  It took place right when the US was entering WW II, so there was tension in the air, especially since the setting was at a radio station and the characters had to deal with news issues about the war on  daily basis.  But the tension wasn't only about the war, there was also tension about love - there were two love issues going on at the station, one involving two voice actors, and one involving Betty, the show's lead.  Betty was torn between two men, and the viewer finds themself torn between which one we want her to end up with.The only bad thing I can say about this show is how it ended - it didn't.  Blasted AMC nixed the show even tho it had on multiple awards simply because the new President didn't like it.  What was extra bad was the prior season had ended with what seemed to be a cliffhanger.  I've had to resign myself with dreaming of how I'd like it to turn out - and I spent the next five years boycotting AMC!",5,"I agree, the best TV show ever",1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,1081,"['show', 'had', 'was', 'best', 'written', 'best', 'acted', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'sex', 'violence', 'was', 'still', 'exciting', 'took', 'place', 'right', 'when', 'US', 'was', 'entering', 'WW', 'II', 'was', 'tension', 'air', 'especially', 'setting', 'was', 'radio', 'station', 'characters', 'had', 'deal', 'news', 'issues', 'war', 'daily', 'basis', 'tension', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'war', 'was', 'also', 'tension', 'love', 'were', 'two', 'love', 'issues', 'going', 'station', 'one', 'involving', 'two', 'voice', 'actors', 'one', 'involving', 'Betty', 'show', 'lead', 'Betty', 'was', 'torn', 'two', 'men', 'viewer', 'torn', 'one', 'want', 'end', 'up', 'with.The', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'how', 'ended', 'did', ""n't"", 'Blasted', 'AMC', 'nixed', 'show', 'even', 'tho', 'had', 'multiple', 'awards', 'simply', 'new', 'President', 'did', ""n't"", 'What', 'was', 'extra', 'bad', 'was', 'prior', 'season', 'had', 'ended', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'cliffhanger', ""'ve"", 'had', 'resign', 'dreaming', 'how', ""'d"", 'like', 'turn', 'out', 'spent', 'next', 'five', 'years', 'boycotting', 'AMC']",Remember WENN

That's the response I received from AMC today. I followed up by suggesting a release to Hulu or some other on-demand service. I can't imagine how such a great show might be allowed to languish in these times when everything is released if it can make a buck. The special Christmas episode with Betty Buckley alone is worthy of a more dignified fate. Maybe it's an issue of royalties? All that aside, if you grew up enjoying old-time radio, drawing room comedies, or are at least a fan of Prairie Home Companion, then Remember WENN is a pitch-perfect bit of light entertainment with a delightful ensemble cast. There are plenty of tv shows that command the modern attention span with thunder and lightning, but this small, luminous show was a standout for its sparkling wit and hijinks, its cheerful embrace of smaller moments, and its ringing endorsement of humanity. It's a treasure and a jewel, somehow consigned to AMC's closet by corporate ignorance or indifference.",5,"Wonderful show, hopeless situation",1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,1178,"['Here', 'latest', 'sad', 'news', 'terrific', 'show', ""'Remember"", 'WENN', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'ratings', 'viewership', 'needed', 'continue', 'production', 'support', 'DVD', 'release', 'response', 'received', 'AMC', 'today', 'followed', 'up', 'suggesting', 'release', 'Hulu', 'other', 'on-demand', 'service', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'such', 'great', 'show', 'might', 'be', 'allowed', 'languish', 'times', 'when', 'everything', 'released', 'can', 'make', 'buck', 'special', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'alone', 'worthy', 'more', 'dignified', 'fate', 'issue', 'royalties', 'aside', 'grew', 'up', 'enjoying', 'old-time', 'radio', 'drawing', 'room', 'comedies', 'are', 'least', 'fan', 'Prairie', 'Home', 'Companion', 'then', 'Remember', 'WENN', 'pitch-perfect', 'bit', 'light', 'entertainment', 'delightful', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'are', 'plenty', 'tv', 'shows', 'command', 'modern', 'attention', 'span', 'thunder', 'lightning', 'small', 'luminous', 'show', 'was', 'standout', 'sparkling', 'wit', 'hijinks', 'cheerful', 'embrace', 'smaller', 'moments', 'ringing', 'endorsement', 'humanity', 'treasure', 'jewel', 'somehow', 'consigned', 'AMC', 'closet', 'corporate', 'ignorance', 'indifference']",Remember WENN
1076661,A9J2NIW7J6JT2,B000QRI1G2,MissPammy,"[4, 4]","I still miss this show, and for all the years it was on TV and all the years since, it has been my #1 favorite television show of all time.  I used to wait excitedly each week for it to come on, and the moment the intro started, I was taken up again in its charm, its quirky characters, and the reassuring feeling of being somehow at home.  There are TV shows I really enjoy now and look forward to each week, but none of them compares to this one.  It was simply stellar in every way, from the authentic costumes and set to the endearing characters.  The look of the show was also unique.  It was filmed differently from regular shows, using a technique that gave it a soft retro look, yet with gorgeous, saturated color.The AMC executive that axed the show might have given some thought to what the viewers wanted before making that decision, but beyond that, I have never been able to understand why such a beloved show has never come out on DVD.  There are legions of people asking for it to be released.  Whatever other considerations there might have been for canceling the show, it is mystifying that with such a pressing demand for a DVD release, none has ever come forth.  It's a travesty, really.  Hopefully someday AMC will be headed up by a wiser person with the insight to recognize that producing DVDs of the series and possibly other memorabilia would be a goldmine.  At the very least, AMC could run the series again in reruns as a summer filler for some other show.  If none of these options are appealing, it would be great if they would then just sell the series to another network that has the sense to show it again to the waiting population that was captivated by it the first time, as well as the new fans waiting to love it.Some television shows become a part of the American culture forever.  Remember WENN was one of those, and it would have become much more so if AMC had done a better job of promoting it.  Every person I know who ever watched it at least once became a diehard fan forever, and I am convinced that if the rest had known about it, it would still be around today.  Once in a blue moon, a show is made that strikes all the right chords in the hearts of the audience.  This was that kind of show.  It was sweet, hilarious, suspenseful, and completely addictive.  I do not watch AMC anymore, because I am so disappointed in the shabby way the fans of this show were treated.  I hope that if it airs again, there will be lots of promotion beforehand so I don't miss a moment of it, and full support by the viewing audience of whatever sponsors sponsor the reruns.  The television industry only cares about money and ratings, so our efforts to make sure they get both when they offer a show that we love is the way to make sure we get to keep watching it.",5,Such a superb show!,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,2793,"['still', 'miss', 'show', 'years', 'was', 'TV', 'years', 'been', '1', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'time', 'used', 'wait', 'excitedly', 'week', 'come', 'moment', 'intro', 'started', 'was', 'taken', 'up', 'again', 'charm', 'quirky', 'characters', 'reassuring', 'feeling', 'being', 'somehow', 'home', 'are', 'TV', 'shows', 'really', 'enjoy', 'now', 'look', 'forward', 'week', 'none', 'one', 'was', 'simply', 'stellar', 'way', 'authentic', 'costumes', 'set', 'endearing', 'characters', 'look', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'unique', 'was', 'filmed', 'differently', 'regular', 'shows', 'using', 'technique', 'gave', 'soft', 'retro', 'look', 'yet', 'gorgeous', 'saturated', 'color.The', 'AMC', 'executive', 'axed', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'thought', 'what', 'viewers', 'wanted', 'making', 'decision', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'understand', 'why', 'beloved', 'show', 'never', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'are', 'legions', 'people', 'asking', 'be', 'released', 'other', 'considerations', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'canceling', 'show', 'mystifying', 'pressing', 'demand', 'DVD', 'release', 'none', 'ever', 'come', 'forth', 'travesty', 'really', 'Hopefully', 'someday', 'AMC', 'will', 'be', 'headed', 'up', 'wiser', 'person', 'insight', 'recognize', 'producing', 'DVDs', 'series', 'possibly', 'other', 'memorabilia', 'would', 'be', 'goldmine', 'very', 'least', 'AMC', 'could', 'run', 'series', 'again', 'reruns', 'summer', 'filler', 'other', 'show', 'none', 'options', 'are', 'appealing', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'would', 'then', 'just', 'sell', 'series', 'network', 'sense', 'show', 'again', 'waiting', 'population', 'was', 'captivated', 'first', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'fans', 'waiting', 'love', 'it.Some', 'television', 'become', 'part', 'American', 'culture', 'forever', 'Remember', 'WENN', 'was', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'AMC', 'had', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'promoting', 'Every', 'person', 'know', 'who', 'ever', 'watched', 'least', 'once', 'became', 'diehard', 'fan', 'forever', 'am', 'convinced', 'rest', 'had', 'known', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'today', 'Once', 'blue', 'moon', 'show', 'made', 'right', 'chords', 'hearts', 'audience', 'was', 'kind', 'show', 'was', 'sweet', 'hilarious', 'suspenseful', 'completely', 'addictive', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'AMC', 'anymore', 'am', 'so', 'disappointed', 'shabby', 'way', 'fans', 'show', 'were', 'treated', 'hope', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'lots', 'promotion', 'beforehand', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'moment', 'full', 'support', 'viewing', 'audience', 'sponsors', 'sponsor', 'reruns', 'television', 'industry', 'only', 'money', 'ratings', 'efforts', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'when', 'offer', 'show', 'love', 'way', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'keep', 'watching']",Remember WENN
