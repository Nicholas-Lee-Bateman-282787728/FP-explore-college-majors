1314426,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B002ZNNXDG,Compay,"[11, 14]","Wrong Side of Town is your typical straight to DVD action flick, with a handful of people cast just to appeal to different audiences.The plot is predictable, and almost identical to the 1985 Schwarzenegger film Commando.  Ex-military toughguy leaves the service, gets into it with the wrong guys, and has to rescue his kidnapped daughter.  The movie's dialogue is awkward and tries too hard to be funny, and too many aspects of the plot don't make any sense.Rob Van Damn, cast as Navy Seal turned landscape architect Bobby Kalinowsky, does a sub-par acting job.  Fellow wrestler Dave Batista easily steals the show as Big Ronnie, Kalinowsky's former war buddy.  Batista's screen presence is simply much better, had he been cast in the lead role instead, I'd be giving this movie a much higher rating.  Despite being front and center on the DVD cover, Batista really doesn't get much screen time, which is a shame since he's easily a more natural actor than most professional wrestlers.  Ja Rule and Omarion both landed ""blink and you missed them"" roles in the movie, so if you're a fan of either, don't bother watching it just for them.The fight choreagraphy isn't anything special, although the rock score for the film is solid.  The only standout fight in the movie is the showdown between Batista's character and Markus, right-hand man to the film's bad guy.  Markus was played by legit martial artist Marrese Crump, who coincidentally trains Batista in real life (The hit ""Batista Crump Workout"" is on Youtube).Overall, I was disappointed by the story, the dialogue, and by Rob Van Dam's weak acting.  Cast Batista as the lead, cook up an original story with Marrese Crump thrown in the mix, and I'll gladly review it four or five stars.",2,Average Straight-To-Video Action Flick,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,1741,"['Wrong', 'Side', 'Town', 'typical', 'straight', 'DVD', 'action', 'flick', 'handful', 'people', 'cast', 'just', 'appeal', 'different', 'audiences.The', 'plot', 'predictable', 'almost', 'identical', '1985', 'Schwarzenegger', 'film', 'Commando', 'Ex-military', 'toughguy', 'service', 'wrong', 'guys', 'rescue', 'kidnapped', 'daughter', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'awkward', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'too', 'many', 'aspects', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.Rob', 'Van', 'Damn', 'cast', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'turned', 'landscape', 'architect', 'Bobby', 'Kalinowsky', 'sub-par', 'acting', 'job', 'Fellow', 'wrestler', 'Dave', 'Batista', 'easily', 'show', 'Big', 'Ronnie', 'Kalinowsky', 'former', 'war', 'buddy', 'Batista', 'screen', 'presence', 'simply', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'lead', 'role', 'instead', ""'d"", 'be', 'giving', 'movie', 'much', 'higher', 'rating', 'being', 'front', 'center', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Batista', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'shame', 'easily', 'more', 'natural', 'actor', 'most', 'professional', 'wrestlers', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'Omarion', 'landed', 'blink', 'missed', 'roles', 'movie', 'so', ""'re"", 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'just', 'them.The', 'fight', 'choreagraphy', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'rock', 'score', 'film', 'solid', 'only', 'standout', 'fight', 'movie', 'showdown', 'Batista', 'character', 'Markus', 'right-hand', 'man', 'film', 'bad', 'guy', 'Markus', 'was', 'played', 'legit', 'martial', 'artist', 'Marrese', 'Crump', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'Batista', 'real', 'life', 'hit', 'Batista', 'Crump', 'Workout', 'Youtube', '.Overall', 'was', 'disappointed', 'story', 'dialogue', 'Rob', 'Van', 'Dam', 'weak', 'acting', 'Cast', 'Batista', 'lead', 'cook', 'up', 'original', 'story', 'Marrese', 'Crump', 'thrown', 'mix', ""'ll"", 'gladly', 'review', 'four', 'five', 'stars']",N/A
1314427,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B002ZNNXDG,D.P.,"[3, 4]","Rob Van Dam (RVD) plays Bobby, a  landscape architect & former Navy Seal, living with a wife & teenage daughter.  When Bobby & his wife decide to go out to a nightclub with the new neighbors, he runs into trouble after accidently killing a man who attempted to rape his wife...a man who happens to be the brother of a mob boss who's blames Bobby for the death & decided to put a $100,000 bounty on him.  Throughout the night, Bobby encounters so many groups of people looking to collect the bounty (including characters played by R&B; artist Omarion, rap artist Ja Rule, and former WWE wrestler Nelson ""Mabel/Viscera/Big Daddy V"" Frazier) along with various people who aren't completely trustworthy from a crooked cop to his former friend (WWE wrestler Dave ""Batista"" Bautista) but when it gets too personal with his daughter being kidnapped, Bobby goes from being the hunted to the hunter.This is one of those low budget action movies where the plot itself was very simple & something the average person can understand. The acting isn't much (RVD & Dave Bautista pretty much played their ""wrestling"" characters).  The action here was martial arts based as RVD did have various fight scenes against multiple men throughout the film while Bautista did have the only one-on-one fight (and the best fight) in the whole movie...and for his WWE fans, you'll see some actions that he's done in the ring as well.  It should be made clear thought that RVD is the star of this movie with the other appearences in the movie from those heavily advertised aren't much as Bautista appears for maybe 15 mins. total while Omarion & Ja Rule's appearences are around 5 minutes each.DVD extras include RVD talking about his experience on the set & the stunts, quick interviews with various members of the cast, movie trailer, and footage of training for the fight scens featuring Bautista.  In the end, this movie was about as good as you expected a low budget movie to be that heavily relied on various names from different venues (wrestling & urban music) to carry the movie than actors.  This isn't a bad movie to the point where you want to shoot yourself in the head afterwards but also not worth going out of your way to see so I recommend for a rental if you have nothing else better to do for an hour & a half.",2,Wrestlers & R&B/Rap Artist Can't Save This Movie,1269648000,"03 27, 2010",2010,2300,"['Rob', 'Van', 'Dam', 'RVD', 'Bobby', 'landscape', 'architect', 'former', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'living', 'wife', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'When', 'Bobby', 'wife', 'decide', 'go', 'out', 'nightclub', 'new', 'neighbors', 'trouble', 'accidently', 'killing', 'man', 'who', 'attempted', 'rape', 'wife', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'brother', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'blames', 'Bobby', 'death', 'decided', 'put', '100,000', 'bounty', 'night', 'Bobby', 'so', 'many', 'groups', 'people', 'looking', 'collect', 'bounty', 'including', 'characters', 'played', 'R', 'B', 'artist', 'Omarion', 'rap', 'artist', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'former', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'Nelson', 'Mabel/Viscera/Big', 'Daddy', 'V', 'Frazier', 'various', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'completely', 'trustworthy', 'crooked', 'cop', 'former', 'friend', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'Dave', 'Batista', 'Bautista', 'when', 'too', 'personal', 'daughter', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'Bobby', 'being', 'hunted', 'hunter.This', 'one', 'low', 'budget', 'action', 'movies', 'where', 'plot', 'was', 'very', 'simple', 'something', 'average', 'person', 'can', 'understand', 'acting', ""n't"", 'much', 'RVD', 'Dave', 'Bautista', 'pretty', 'much', 'played', 'wrestling', 'characters', 'action', 'here', 'was', 'martial', 'arts', 'based', 'RVD', 'did', 'have', 'various', 'fight', 'scenes', 'multiple', 'men', 'film', 'Bautista', 'did', 'have', 'only', 'one-on-one', 'fight', 'best', 'fight', 'whole', 'movie', 'WWE', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'see', 'actions', 'done', 'ring', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'clear', 'thought', 'RVD', 'star', 'movie', 'other', 'appearences', 'movie', 'heavily', 'advertised', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'Bautista', 'maybe', '15', 'mins', 'total', 'Omarion', 'Ja', 'Rule', 'appearences', 'are', '5', 'minutes', 'each.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'RVD', 'talking', 'experience', 'set', 'stunts', 'quick', 'interviews', 'various', 'members', 'cast', 'movie', 'trailer', 'footage', 'training', 'fight', 'featuring', 'Bautista', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'expected', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'be', 'heavily', 'relied', 'various', 'names', 'different', 'venues', 'wrestling', 'urban', 'music', 'carry', 'movie', 'actors', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'point', 'where', 'want', 'shoot', 'head', 'afterwards', 'also', 'not', 'worth', 'going', 'way', 'see', 'so', 'recommend', 'rental', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'better', 'do', 'hour', 'half']",N/A

1314429,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002ZNNXDG,Haunted Flower,"[0, 0]","""Wrong Side of Town"" was written and directed by David DeFalco and stars Rob Van Dam as Bobby, a guy from special forces in the wrong place at the wrong time (a club when he's a buff guy that hates to dance). A bad guy named Seth's dumb brother is accidentally killed after he tries to rape Bobby's wife so Seth assumes Bobby was the cause and puts a hit out on him for $100,000 for any goon that can get him.Rob Van Dam is not believable in any regular conversations establishing relationships, but is great at taunting and clever quips in a fight. He handles the physicality of the role in the fight scenes easily due to his depth of experience. It is pretty cool when a goon called Animal shows up at a gas station and low and behold, it is the wrestler previously known as Big Daddy V or Viscera, real name Nelson Frazier Jr. (Junior to whom I can only imagine).After enough fights and car chases late in the movie, Bobby goes to B.R./Big Ronnie played by David Bautista, another partner in special forces for help. Dave Bautista (known in the WWE is Batista) seems stronger by comparison in the acting department, mostly because all he has to do is be a tough guy and make threats. This movie is only 85 minutes long and Bautista doesn't show up until 45 minutes in so leading off with him first on the cover seems a bit misleading but he has a more imposing presence that looks better out front. Bautista isn't involved for long either, maybe 15 minutes of the film, this is really Rob Van Dam's movie even though the cover won't admit it. Ja Rule is also on the cover for some reason but shows up as one of many goons that try to take Rob Van Dam down late in the movie for about five minutes total.There are so many obvious cliches. The boss has two bald, bearded bikers for henchmen who are as dumb as any stereotype and don't even check to see if the hero is dead before reporting back. There is an obligatory stripper club scene since they are in the ""wrong side of town"" complete with many topless women and lots of swearing. No wonder the WWE didn't jump up and down to produce this one since it goes against the somewhat family-friendly image they try to promote currently for their young fans.The layout of the story is poor. For example, after an attack the two couples go to the cops and immediately change their mind about being there and ask for a ride home, the only purpose of the visit appears to be so Rob Van Dam can flash his special services badge for the camera. They are sent on their way in a taxi, not a police cruiser so that the driver can be easily corruptible after receiving a text incentive to pull over.Another poor set-up. This smart special forces guy actually goes home while on the run while that would be a good place for the bad guys to lay in wait for him. After a lengthy scene of first aid from his wounds, he finds his daughter has been kidnapped to draw him out...Since he is at home, he can use all the special forces stuff he wants from his secret stash to come prepared, how dumb can these bad guys be? They are going after him for no reason since the brother was an idiot and they allow him every opportunity to defeat them if he wants. The ""big surprise"" at the end still doesn't change the stupidity of the bad guys.The editing is poor making the action sequences seem slower. Scenes are poorly lit and it messes up the focus on the camera. The shaky handheld cam does not improve matters outside of fight scenes. Two people can be laying still having a conversation and the camera keeps wobbling. What's worse is that the story is weak, the writing is poor, and the whole thing just feels like some sort of cheap B film, the straight-to-dvd-ness really shines through.Favorite line of the movie after daughter meets Bautista: ""His tattoos were awesome, I want one!""",1,"Wow, this movie was soooo sad.

Films *directed* by wrestlers are another matter, but while I'm glad thatDavid DeFalcoseems to be distancing himself from the exploitation torture porn business, his contribution here means very little. Even with two of the business' biggest stars in tow, ""Wrong Side of Town"" is a forgettable little action-thriller much in the same vein as a lot of the other dreck I've recently reviewed. Absolutely nothing special.The plot: when ex-Navy SEAL Bobby Kalinowsky (Rob Van Dam) kills the brother of a sadistic gangster (Jerry Katz,Knucklehead), he and his family must fear retaliation in the form of a $100,000 price placed on his head.The film is the victim of false advertising. Get David Bautista and Ja Rule off the cover, Sony - they have a combined screentime of less than fifteen minutes. Beyond that, the movie does okay as far as production is concerned: sometimes the camerawork looks cheap and a few voiceovers are evident, but considering that the film was shot for under $2 million, I can forgive these deficiencies. There are a few go-nowhere scenes, but the writing isn't awful otherwise. (SPOILER) Heck, I took unexpected pleasure in the scene wherein Bautista's character shoots Ja Rule in the head. This is all fine and good...but what then? With a story that doesn't really intrigue by itself, ""Wrong Side of Town"" was banking on some solid action scenes to support it, but these just aren't there.Through his successful incorporation of martial arts into his in-ring performances, Van Dam secured both popularity in the wrestling world and a handful of roles in legitimate action flicks wherein he received the honor of being the only pro wrestler to have been directed and/or choreographed by bothTony LeungandYuen Woo-Ping(only one other wrestler has matched the strength of these credits: Nathan Jones has been wrangled byWoo-PingandPanna Rittakrai). I had really been hoping that some of their style and flair would carry over to his first starring vehicle, but by and large his three fight scenes - all against multiple opponents - are as poorly-shot as any brawl of these days featuring the other Van Damme. The only encounter of any interest is between Bautista and newcomer Marrese Crump, who's set to appear in Tony Jaa's ""Tom Yum Goong 2"" and gets to show off a few promising kicks before the two of them draw knives and proceed to have a veritable pattycake fight worthy of Steven Seagal's lower quality work.I wish I had more to say about this one, seeing as I had respectable hopes for it, but I can't help but think that I'll have forgotten the movie by tomorrow, so why waste words?
