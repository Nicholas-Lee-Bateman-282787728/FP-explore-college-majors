777866,A25Y22XPPLGPF8,B0000DBJBD,"a customer ""me""","[3, 4]","I have now got a long lean strong flexible 48 year old body with this yoga workout dvd, after doing it for about 6 months, I am short, only 5'1, so lifting weights, was making me look short and boxy.Tari Rose is absolutely fantastic. My time is limited, I wanted it all in a yoga dvd and I got it. This dvd has strength training, yoga-stretching, flexibility, balance and relaxation - I had only been doing yoga a month when I pick this dvd up, so I pretty much knew the breathing and alignment one should have.  This kicked my butt and I poured sweat, my heart rate went up, so I got quite a bit of cardio with it as well. My belly is gone and my thighs and legs, no longer have saddle bags and are well toned and strong, and don't look so short anymore, so are my arms, no more flab, my endurance and stamina is out of this world, so is my lung power!I still do this dvd minimum of 3 times a week, because it works for me and my body, and I haven't gotten tired of it, like so many other dvds, and it is still a challenge to me.For such a strenuous workout, I do wish there was more stretching relaxation at the end, but I am still giving it a 5, because you just can't beat the quality and effectiveness of this workout.  I just add 10 minutes more of my own stretching to it sometimes.  I have so many yoga dvds and not many of them compare to this one.I have to have low impact workouts, where I don't put a lot of stress on my ankles, from having surgery and pins put in my ankles, this was exactly what I was looking for.  I didn't want to spend a lot of time, doing individual workouts, so I got basically a bit of everything in this dvd.  Buy it, you won't regret it, and the price can't be beat, if this 48 year old woman can do it, you can too, just do what you can, a bit at a time and work your way up, you won't regret it.P.S. I don't understand why this dvd isn't more well known or popular. Tari Rose is great, and she looks great!  This dvd has literally, and honestly transformed my body for the better.  P.S. I do, do a seperate cardio each day.  No dvd has a magical cure for everything, but this is close to it.",5,Excellent,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,2132,"['have', 'now', 'got', 'long', 'lean', 'strong', 'flexible', '48', 'year', 'old', 'body', 'yoga', 'workout', 'dvd', 'doing', '6', 'months', 'am', 'short', 'only', '5', '1', 'so', 'lifting', 'weights', 'was', 'making', 'look', 'short', 'boxy.Tari', 'Rose', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'time', 'limited', 'wanted', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'got', 'dvd', 'strength', 'training', 'yoga-stretching', 'flexibility', 'balance', 'relaxation', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'month', 'when', 'pick', 'dvd', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'knew', 'breathing', 'alignment', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'kicked', 'butt', 'poured', 'sweat', 'heart', 'rate', 'went', 'up', 'got', 'quite', 'bit', 'cardio', 'as', 'well', 'My', 'belly', 'gone', 'thighs', 'legs', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'saddle', 'bags', 'are', 'well', 'toned', 'strong', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'short', 'anymore', 'so', 'are', 'arms', 'more', 'flab', 'endurance', 'stamina', 'world', 'so', 'lung', 'power', 'still', 'do', 'dvd', 'minimum', '3', 'times', 'week', 'body', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'tired', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'dvds', 'still', 'challenge', 'me.For', 'strenuous', 'workout', 'do', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'stretching', 'relaxation', 'end', 'am', 'still', 'giving', '5', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'quality', 'effectiveness', 'workout', 'just', 'add', '10', 'minutes', 'more', 'own', 'stretching', 'sometimes', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'not', 'many', 'compare', 'one.I', 'have', 'have', 'low', 'impact', 'workouts', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'lot', 'stress', 'ankles', 'having', 'surgery', 'pins', 'put', 'ankles', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'doing', 'individual', 'workouts', 'got', 'basically', 'bit', 'everything', 'dvd', 'Buy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', '48', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'too', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'bit', 'time', 'work', 'way', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'it.P.S', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'more', 'well', 'known', 'popular', 'Tari', 'Rose', 'great', 'great', 'dvd', 'literally', 'honestly', 'transformed', 'body', 'better', 'P.S', 'do', 'do', 'seperate', 'cardio', 'day', 'dvd', 'magical', 'cure', 'everything', 'close']",N/A
777867,A118DD1BQQX1WX,B0000DBJBD,James E. White,"[20, 21]","I tried this workout because it got some great ratings.  I can now see why.  This work out is not for the faint of heart.  In fact, I would say that the overall workout is on par or maybe a step below a primary series (ashtanga) workout.  The poses themselves are not beyond the experienced beginner level.  However, it is what she does with them that makes the workout intermediate to advanced.  She will perform a given pose repeatedly in regular speed, and then in super slow motion. It is this super slow motion that really builds strength and endurance, because you just can't know how to perform the pose, but you have to be able to hold the pose for a while.  In addition,  the abs section of this work was very challenging for me.  Just so that I don't scare off anyone new to yoga who wants to try this DVD, Tari does offer you the option of watching the pose performed first, then you can follow along with either the full or modified version of the pose.  This DVD was 60+ minutes of sweat and work.  If you are ready for a fairly intense workout then give this a try.",5,Wow!

I tend to be a bit on the stocky side, so I like doing strength building that combines cardio and/or stretching.  I also have a neck that can easily get out of whack, and weights can aggravate this if I'm not careful.  I frequently do Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's Kundalini Yoga DVDs as well.  I would consider myself in good shape; not gym rat kind of good shape, but good shape nonetheless.  Another thing worth noting is I own many workout DVDs, and have grown picky about which ones I do.This workout is very challenging.  Tari Rose goes through a sequence of true yoga poses; at the end of each series you do one in verrry slooowly.  It's not power yoga; in fact, the challenge is in slowly, smoothly moving through each sequence with control.  While motions-wise, this is genuine yoga poses, it lacks the spiritual aspect some other yoga DVDs possess.It's really too bad she hasn't come out with any other DVDs, because I really like her style.  She has put together an effective workout, and she's very pleasant.  This isn't the cheapest yoga workout you'll buy, but it's certainly worth the money, and I'm very happy with my purchase.  Were she to come up with other DVDs in this style, I would buy them in a second.",5,Wonderful - one of my favorite strength building workouts!,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,1248,"['wonderful', 'DVD', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'stocky', 'side', 'so', 'like', 'doing', 'strength', 'building', 'cardio', 'and/or', 'stretching', 'also', 'have', 'neck', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'whack', 'weights', 'can', 'aggravate', ""'m"", 'not', 'careful', 'frequently', 'do', 'Ana', 'Brett', 'Ravi', 'Singh', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'consider', 'good', 'shape', 'not', 'gym', 'rat', 'kind', 'good', 'shape', 'good', 'shape', 'nonetheless', 'thing', 'worth', 'noting', 'own', 'many', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'have', 'grown', 'picky', 'ones', 'do.This', 'workout', 'very', 'challenging', 'Tari', 'Rose', 'sequence', 'true', 'yoga', 'poses', 'end', 'series', 'do', 'one', 'verrry', 'slooowly', 'not', 'power', 'yoga', 'fact', 'challenge', 'slowly', 'smoothly', 'moving', 'sequence', 'control', 'motions-wise', 'genuine', 'yoga', 'poses', 'spiritual', 'aspect', 'other', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'possess.It', 'really', 'too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'other', 'DVDs', 'really', 'style', 'put', 'together', 'effective', 'workout', 'very', 'pleasant', ""n't"", 'cheapest', 'yoga', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'certainly', 'worth', 'money', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'purchase', 'Were', 'come', 'up', 'other', 'DVDs', 'style', 'would', 'buy', 'second']",N/A

This incorporates muscles up and down your body and I really enjoyed it.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because some moves can put strain on you back if you aren't using the right muscles and she never made mention of that.

Anyhow, my lack of yoga experience really was not an issue.  I was able to go through the entire routine and learn all the moves.I have done many cardio videos, but this video offered something new for me.  I actually found it challenging!  It really stretches you out and my arms were definitely shaking by the end!!!!  This will tone and stretch your entire body!!  I really enjoyed this and I actually had to do some of the modifications for the exercises.  All exercises were great, but I felt the abs section was not that effective for me... then again I have very strong abs.  For each exercise she will do them 2-3 times fast and then they will be done for a slow count of ten.  This really works you!A solid DVD, easy to follow, works your body, I am hooked!  I recommend this for ALL levels of fitness.  Modifications of the exercises are shown for begineers.

777871,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B0000DBJBD,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[2, 3]","This is not spiritual or flows in any way, this is yoga for muscle building only. There is no instruction on breathing or body awareness. The music is the usual cheap, lightly annoying noise music from gym classes.This is yoga converted into a toning gym class for the not faint of heart.The stage is stark white & Tari shows modifications with the two backup women.What's great is Tari Rosi is very friendly, has great enthusiasm, you can tell she loves this workout & isn't annoying even though she does a lot of counting when she does the moves slowly or when holding it. If it wasn't for her, this dvd would be very, very boring.To do this, I would say you'd have to have endurance & decent muscle strength to start with. My first time, I couldn't complete it, though tried the fwd bend/chair pose & abs section & found it a good moderate to advanced workout. though I have yet to complete the whole thing since it's long & definitely challenging.She does basic poses normal speed a couple of times, then super-slow in the count of 10 2x, then normal again a couple of times. She builds on different areas such as back, shoulders, butt, abs, etc.Such moves are standing fwd bends/chair, downward dog/upward dog, bridge also w/single leg up, warrior 2/side angle (bound too), side plank, etc. Each two pose exercise is done for several minutes.The last section for the abs has leg lifts/down, laying spread legs up/down w/a crunch, pilates like shoulders & straight legs up & going up/down slightly & 1 or 2 other exercises. It ends with some nice spinal twists. No meditation of course.People who want the toning/balance aspect of yoga will love this, those who want body awareness & keep their mind on their body by the more authentic yoga should look elsewhere.You can see more reviews with word for word on the workout at videofitness",4,Gym style killer toning workout using yoga poses,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,1841,"['not', 'spiritual', 'flows', 'way', 'yoga', 'muscle', 'building', 'only', 'instruction', 'breathing', 'body', 'awareness', 'music', 'usual', 'cheap', 'lightly', 'annoying', 'noise', 'music', 'gym', 'classes.This', 'yoga', 'converted', 'toning', 'gym', 'class', 'not', 'faint', 'heart.The', 'stage', 'stark', 'white', 'Tari', 'modifications', 'two', 'backup', 'women.What', 'great', 'Tari', 'Rosi', 'very', 'friendly', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'can', 'tell', 'workout', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'even', 'lot', 'counting', 'when', 'moves', 'slowly', 'when', 'holding', 'was', ""n't"", 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'boring.To', 'do', 'would', 'say', ""'d"", 'have', 'have', 'endurance', 'decent', 'muscle', 'strength', 'start', 'first', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'complete', 'though', 'tried', 'fwd', 'bend/chair', 'pose', 'abs', 'section', 'found', 'good', 'moderate', 'advanced', 'workout', 'have', 'yet', 'complete', 'whole', 'thing', 'long', 'definitely', 'challenging.She', 'basic', 'poses', 'normal', 'speed', 'couple', 'times', 'then', 'super-slow', 'count', '10', '2x', 'then', 'normal', 'again', 'couple', 'times', 'different', 'areas', 'such', 'back', 'shoulders', 'butt', 'abs', 'etc.Such', 'moves', 'are', 'standing', 'fwd', 'bends/chair', 'downward', 'dog/upward', 'dog', 'bridge', 'also', 'w/single', 'up', 'warrior', '2/side', 'angle', 'too', 'side', 'plank', 'etc', 'two', 'pose', 'exercise', 'done', 'several', 'minutes.The', 'last', 'section', 'abs', 'leg', 'lifts/down', 'laying', 'spread', 'legs', 'up/down', 'w/a', 'crunch', 'shoulders', 'straight', 'up', 'going', 'up/down', 'slightly', '1', '2', 'other', 'exercises', 'nice', 'spinal', 'twists', 'meditation', 'course.People', 'who', 'want', 'toning/balance', 'aspect', 'yoga', 'will', 'love', 'who', 'want', 'body', 'awareness', 'keep', 'mind', 'body', 'more', 'authentic', 'yoga', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere.You', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'reviews', 'word', 'word', 'workout', 'videofitness']",N/A
