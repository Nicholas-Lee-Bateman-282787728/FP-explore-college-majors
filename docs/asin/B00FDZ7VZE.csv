1671109,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00FDZ7VZE,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[31, 31]","No surprise if you read the details prior to buying. Every decade since the 1930s is represented in one or more film features up to the first century of the new millennium. There is only so much you can do for movies created in past, and done at the time with state of the art technology, but much less than the capability of today's HD. What counts in this price-reasonable set is the nostalgia. It is a great assortment of Christmas video that has come down through the ages.Young viewers will not recognize the stars that made history; they are too young. But those of us who have lived through a good portion of the history represented with these 20 segments of Christmas Past will celebrate anew, just as done when the feature first was shown. the price is less than 4-bits per episode, but then one has to be a bit on the nostalgic-age to even know what 4-bits means. Grin, grin. I'm there.True, some of the old films have the look of old films. That is expected. I also own a couple of silent movies on DVD and they appear on a HD TV screen just like they did in the nickle movie theater. BW, jumpy, and silent. I love it. For someone born like me in the 1940s, it's a Christmas trip down memory lane. I know new Christmas movies sell for $20 and more, so if these were current movies the set would be selling for 20 X $20 or $400. Nostalgia is still Christmas joy and on the inexpensive side. I like that.This is a fun set of DVDs that can be played continuously, quietly as background throughout the days ahead of Christmas Day; much like a Christmas music CD. But when something exciting, and memorable comes on, one can sit and view as well as listen. At least for those of us blessed with the stay-at-home days.We enjoy our purchase. But then we enjoy all things retro. We are retro.Merry Christmas one and all.",4,GOOD FOR WHAT IT IS; NOSTALGIA TO THE 9TH,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1823,"['surprise', 'read', 'details', 'prior', 'buying', 'decade', '1930s', 'represented', 'one', 'more', 'film', 'up', 'first', 'century', 'new', 'millennium', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'movies', 'created', 'past', 'done', 'time', 'state', 'art', 'technology', 'much', 'less', 'capability', 'today', 'HD', 'What', 'price-reasonable', 'set', 'nostalgia', 'great', 'assortment', 'Christmas', 'video', 'come', 'down', 'ages.Young', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'recognize', 'stars', 'made', 'history', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'good', 'portion', 'history', 'represented', '20', 'segments', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'will', 'celebrate', 'anew', 'just', 'done', 'when', 'feature', 'first', 'was', 'shown', 'price', 'less', '4-bits', 'episode', 'then', 'one', 'be', 'bit', 'nostalgic-age', 'even', 'know', 'what', '4-bits', 'means', 'Grin', 'grin', ""'m"", 'there.True', 'old', 'films', 'have', 'look', 'old', 'films', 'expected', 'also', 'own', 'couple', 'silent', 'movies', 'DVD', 'appear', 'HD', 'TV', 'screen', 'just', 'did', 'nickle', 'movie', 'theater', 'BW', 'jumpy', 'silent', 'love', 'someone', 'born', '1940s', 'Christmas', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'know', 'new', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'sell', '20', 'more', 'were', 'current', 'movies', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'selling', '20', 'X', '20', '400', 'Nostalgia', 'still', 'Christmas', 'joy', 'inexpensive', 'side', 'that.This', 'fun', 'set', 'DVDs', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'continuously', 'quietly', 'background', 'days', 'ahead', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'much', 'Christmas', 'music', 'CD', 'when', 'something', 'exciting', 'memorable', 'one', 'can', 'sit', 'view', 'as', 'well', 'listen', 'least', 'blessed', 'stay-at-home', 'days.We', 'enjoy', 'purchase', 'then', 'enjoy', 'things', 'retro', 'are', 'retro.Merry', 'Christmas', 'one']",Family Holiday Film Collection: Twenty Films to Celebrate the Season!
