1168405,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B001AUKUV8,Artist & Author,"[10, 12]","Right at the outset it needs to be said that there are three versions of this movie.  The Netherlands [Kruistocht in spijkerbroek] version is 138 minutes long; the German version is 125 minutes, and the North American is stripped down to 100 minutes.That said, this is a wonderful movie for traditional values, especially religious, families.  In a sense, it is a clever comparison between the lack of Christian faith in the modern boy, Dolf, with the simple, trusting faith of the bulk of the people on the Children's Crusade.  I think the movie was quite fair in its treatment of both sides.  Of course, they had to show the monk-leader to be anything but Christian, which is a negative.  But, he clearly is the exception, not the rule, among the believers.  In one of the climactic scenes the behavior of the monk and Dolf was compared, in that the monk talked a good talk, but it was Dolf who acted over and over again to help the people.  We don't know Dolf's inner spiritual life, but he clearly did to 'the least of these' in the way that Jesus spoke of in the Gospels.Of course, there is lots of great adventure that will keep the whole family glued to the screen.  There is quite a bit of violence, but nothing particularly gory.  Also, this was a very hard time in which to live, so they are faced with illness and even the death of some of the children.  One of Dolf's most faithful admirers dies when he is kidnapped.  Some of the children are sold into slavery for passage through a certain area, but Dolf springs into action and leads a group to rescue the kids.If you need one movie to entertain the whole family, I think this would be a great choice.  Parents may need to explain things to the younger children, but I am sure that even to a kindergartner will be able to tell who is good and who is not.  Finally, there is virtually no questionable language.  There is a bit from the modern people, but the overwhelming majority of the film takes place with the simple Christian children trying to serve God in the best way they could.",5,A 'Whole Family' Movie,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2051,"['Right', 'outset', 'be', 'said', 'are', 'three', 'versions', 'movie', 'Netherlands', '[', 'Kruistocht', 'spijkerbroek', ']', 'version', '138', 'minutes', 'long', 'German', 'version', '125', 'minutes', 'North', 'American', 'stripped', 'down', '100', 'minutes.That', 'said', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'traditional', 'values', 'especially', 'religious', 'families', 'sense', 'clever', 'comparison', 'lack', 'Christian', 'faith', 'modern', 'boy', 'Dolf', 'simple', 'trusting', 'faith', 'bulk', 'people', 'Children', 'Crusade', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'fair', 'treatment', 'sides', 'course', 'had', 'show', 'monk-leader', 'be', 'anything', 'Christian', 'negative', 'clearly', 'exception', 'not', 'rule', 'believers', 'one', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'behavior', 'monk', 'Dolf', 'was', 'compared', 'monk', 'talked', 'good', 'talk', 'was', 'Dolf', 'who', 'acted', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'help', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Dolf', 'inner', 'spiritual', 'life', 'clearly', 'did', ""'the"", 'least', 'way', 'Jesus', 'spoke', 'Gospels.Of', 'course', 'lots', 'great', 'adventure', 'will', 'keep', 'whole', 'family', 'glued', 'screen', 'quite', 'bit', 'violence', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'gory', 'Also', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'live', 'are', 'faced', 'illness', 'even', 'death', 'children', 'One', 'Dolf', 'most', 'faithful', 'admirers', 'dies', 'when', 'kidnapped', 'children', 'are', 'sold', 'slavery', 'passage', 'certain', 'area', 'Dolf', 'springs', 'action', 'group', 'rescue', 'kids.If', 'need', 'one', 'movie', 'entertain', 'whole', 'family', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'choice', 'Parents', 'may', 'need', 'explain', 'things', 'younger', 'children', 'am', 'sure', 'even', 'kindergartner', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'who', 'good', 'who', 'not', 'Finally', 'virtually', 'questionable', 'language', 'bit', 'modern', 'people', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'film', 'place', 'simple', 'Christian', 'children', 'trying', 'serve', 'God', 'best', 'way', 'could']",Crusade: A March Through Time

1168407,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001AUKUV8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 3]","First the Dutch gave us those clogs and Vermeer and that tasty Edam cheese, and then followed up with Rutger Hauer and Famke Janssen and, of course, Ikea. To round off this very shallow breakdown of Dutch exports, here's this pretty neat movie CRUSADE: A MARCH THROUGH TIME (otherwise known as CRUSADE IN JEANS or KRUISTOCHT IN SPIJKERBROEK). Adapted from and apparently diverging a bit from Thea Beckman's novelCrusade in Jeans, it's an absorbing coming-of-age time travel adventure set primarily in the Middle Ages. I think it's well worth watching.It's not often that one gets a second chance in life. Teenaged soccer player Rudolf Vega had just royally bollixed it up and cost his team and country the European Junior Cup Championship. But this is a sci-fi picture and it's encouraged that you roll with the unbelievable. Dolf's scientist mom has built a time machine, and it doesn't take too long for a distraught Dolf to have it in his mind that he can time travel to the immediate past and replay the championship match. He sneaks in the lab, punches in the time travel computations, and bollixes that up, too. A startled Rudolf Vega finds himself in the year 1212 and taking part in the Children's Crusade, a self-referred Army of Innocents composed of thousands of children journeying to Jerusalem's gates to convert heathens, infidels, and other naysayers of clogs, Edam cheese, and Ikea.Stranded in the Middle Ages and alternatively regarded as a miracle worker and a minion of the Devil, Dolf and his contemporary perspective predictably clash with 13th Century thinking and beliefs. Although he starts out a sort of whiny kid, he rapidly enough straightens out his act, his modern day wits rapidly elevating him to the rank of squire. He ends up making a difference as the pilgrimage encounters arrogant lords, mass starvation, deadly disease, slavers, and a corrupt companion in the midst.It's gratifying that the movie chooses to veer away from the kiddish shenanigans of, say, A KID IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT, a film which has its own niche and is more tot-friendly. CRUSADE carries more weight, takes its story more seriously and is keyed by the kid actors' quite sincere, very good performances. The two young leads, Joe Flynn and Stephanie Leonidas, are outstanding and create sparks together. In tone this movie is more in line with LIONHEART, another (but rather more boring) film about the Children's Crusade. However, CRUSADE tends to be more spirited and playful, the nature of the premise allowing for several cute and fun moments. You can't help but smile at the effect a Mars bar has on the raggedy children or at Dolf putting to good use that iPod of his, or as he calls it: a ""troubadour in a box."" Now, medieval children baking bread whilst singing along to Queen's ""We Are the Champions"" may be stretching things a bit too far, but I ate it up, brother!Interwoven into the main story thread is a side arc involving Dolf's scientist mom frantically trying to get him back to the present, even as her backers threaten to shut her down. Thank goodness for historical records.CRUSADE: A MARCH THROUGH TIME has its share of action, although it plays fair in that it doesn't portray the few warrior-minded children as being able to easily stand up to grown combatants. Dolf himself doesn't suddenly acquire massive martial skills. Instead he consistently relies on his 21st Century brains to problem solve. But, realistically, he can't save everyone, and he doesn't, and Joe Flynn is a savvy enough actor that he's able to roll with his character arc and demonstrate grief and growth and maturity. This movie - part science-fiction, part medieval adventure, and most improbable - still manages to deliver a powerful coming-of-age story.I saw the film in its true entirety at a buddy's house, so I do want to echo one of the reviewers in that this version is only 100 minutes long, meaning that about half an hour of story content is missing here, resulting in a sometimes choppy feel. Thing is, far as I know, the film in its more than 2 hours running time is only available in Region 2, so I'm envying those lucky bastards who own an All Region DVD player. Regarding bonus stuff, there's not much in the way of that on this DVD. There's a brief, five-minute Making Of featurette and the film trailer. The Dutch evidently feel that they've contributed enough already. To which I say: Ikea rocks!",4,"""Crap!

1168408,A1EUFCOZLSAWZP,B001AUKUV8,Medieval Lady,"[0, 0]","I heartily agree with the reviewer who stated that this movie is strong even though it has no Hollywood style gloss. Thank God for that!This film has more of soul than Hollywood films such as Timeline which falls under the same genre. The latter relies on action to keep the audiences interest, A March through time is far more of a human drama, which explores the motivations of well developed characters. We see Dolf (Rudolf) the male lead grow from the complaining, indulged modern Kid, to a charismatic and compassionate leader, whom the other children come to love and respect.Whereas Timeline is mostly shallow, and devoid of anything but a superficial exploration of moral and scientific themes, these are strongly present in A March Through Time. The audience is presented with the themes of friendship, loyalty, love and sacrifice, as well as a thought provoking exploration of the uses and abuses of religion.This is to some characters a convinient justification for thier own selfish ends, and a means of controlling people, whilst to others thier faith forms a genuine basis for thier life and behaviour, as well as a strong moral axis.There is also mention of the theoretical physical effects of the alterations in time, as well as the problems and challenges of overcoming this. This gives the film something of a pseudo- scientific basis that is lacking in others like it.Many such time travel movies, especially those set in the ancient of medieval times adopt a very arrogant and patronising view of past eras and the people who lived in them. With modern characters harping on about how much cleverer they are, and how much more knowledge they have than people from the past, or else simply presenting medieval people as superstitious idiots.This movie does this less often than most, and Dolf comes to understand and respect the people around him, and adapt to thier 'strange' ways, without always assuming he is better than them.",4,Not the typical time-travel yarn,1309996800,"07 7, 2011",2011,1949,"['heartily', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'stated', 'movie', 'strong', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'gloss', 'Thank', 'God', 'film', 'more', 'soul', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'such', 'Timeline', 'same', 'genre', 'latter', 'relies', 'action', 'keep', 'audiences', 'interest', 'March', 'time', 'far', 'more', 'human', 'drama', 'motivations', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'see', 'Dolf', 'Rudolf', 'male', 'lead', 'grow', 'complaining', 'indulged', 'modern', 'Kid', 'charismatic', 'compassionate', 'leader', 'whom', 'other', 'children', 'come', 'love', 'respect.Whereas', 'Timeline', 'mostly', 'shallow', 'devoid', 'anything', 'superficial', 'exploration', 'moral', 'scientific', 'themes', 'are', 'strongly', 'present', 'March', 'Time', 'audience', 'presented', 'themes', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'as', 'well', 'thought', 'provoking', 'exploration', 'uses', 'abuses', 'religion.This', 'characters', 'convinient', 'justification', 'thier', 'own', 'selfish', 'ends', 'means', 'controlling', 'people', 'whilst', 'others', 'faith', 'forms', 'genuine', 'basis', 'thier', 'life', 'behaviour', 'as', 'well', 'strong', 'moral', 'axis.There', 'also', 'mention', 'theoretical', 'physical', 'effects', 'alterations', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'problems', 'challenges', 'overcoming', 'film', 'something', 'pseudo-', 'scientific', 'basis', 'lacking', 'others', 'it.Many', 'such', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'especially', 'set', 'ancient', 'medieval', 'times', 'adopt', 'very', 'arrogant', 'patronising', 'view', 'past', 'eras', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'modern', 'characters', 'harping', 'how', 'much', 'cleverer', 'are', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'knowledge', 'have', 'people', 'past', 'else', 'simply', 'presenting', 'medieval', 'people', 'superstitious', 'idiots.This', 'movie', 'less', 'often', 'most', 'Dolf', 'understand', 'respect', 'people', 'adapt', 'thier', ""'strange"", 'ways', 'always', 'assuming', 'better']",Crusade: A March Through Time
