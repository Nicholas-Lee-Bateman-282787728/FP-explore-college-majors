1015139,AKKSHEGRQVQRK,B000HKKY3G,Great Movie Addict,"[4, 7]","DeMille was clever at combining sex with religion (see his 1927 ""King of Kings"" and the way he embellishes the story of Mary Magdalen). In this movie he combines gorgeous Hedy Lamarr with hunk Victor Mature -- two ingenious strokes of casting -- along with enough corn to feed everyone in Canaan. Too many Philistine officials have British accents and the entire cast looks overwhelmingly Western European. The costuming and military gear are a hodgepodge from various cultures, but seem to be generally accurate. That said, the scenes where Mature slaughters a slew of his enemies with a donkey's jawbone and then later brings down the Philistine temple, not to mention the sight of Hedy herself, are  themselves worth the price of admission. An earlier action scene in which Mature strangles a lion (""He's only a young lion"", Samson says dismissively in the script) just doesn't seem to pack the wallop it should, likely because in many of the quick cuts it's easy to tell that Mature had been replaced by a stunt man. One main selling point of many DeMille movies is spectacle; oddly, the only big spectacle is Samson's destruction of the temple, but it's still a mighty impressive piece of work given the technology of 1949 film making. The movie's plot line diverges wholesale from legend and Biblical scripture. In the movie Samson's bride dies by the spear, but official legend says she was burned -- probably a little too raw for 1949 crowds. In the movie Delilah does the haircutting, contrary to legend, and in the following scenes Mature's shortened hair is a bit too cleverly coiffed for having been cut with a hunting knife. Later, it looks more convincing. Many of the interior scenes look so stagey you have little difficulty guessing how many of the production crew were lurking in the wings and behind the walls. Aside from all this, the movie's major fault for me is that it's about half an hour too long. But for all the movie's flaws, the basic morality tale survives with all its ageless appeal. Mature's performance is unique, unlikely to be equalled by any possible remake. He's especially effective in the latter part of the film. Hedy's performance demonstrates that she had not only beauty but talent, especially in the later scenes. In fact, the film's romantic and psychological interest becomes much more involving after Samson's haircut. The scene in which Hedy first realizes the full effect of Samson's blindness is among her best work, and in many of her scenes that follow you'd almost think she was Garbo. From that point on, the movie and characters are raised almost to a 5-star level. S&D certainly has its moments: I saw its initial release at the age of five and for years recalled many scenes in detail. As for casting young Russ Tamblyn as Saul, well, it helps not to take this film too literally. Afterthought: one reviewer here was disappointed that the DVD isn't in wide-screen format. Sorry, youngster, but wide-screen movies didn't arrive until a few years later.",4,"Essential Hedy and Vic, somewhat generic DeMille",1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,3010,"['DeMille', 'was', 'clever', 'combining', 'sex', 'religion', 'see', '1927', 'King', 'Kings', 'way', 'story', 'Mary', 'Magdalen', 'movie', 'gorgeous', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'hunk', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'two', 'ingenious', 'strokes', 'casting', 'enough', 'corn', 'feed', 'everyone', 'Canaan', 'Too', 'many', 'Philistine', 'officials', 'have', 'British', 'accents', 'entire', 'cast', 'overwhelmingly', 'Western', 'European', 'costuming', 'military', 'gear', 'are', 'hodgepodge', 'various', 'cultures', 'seem', 'be', 'generally', 'accurate', 'said', 'scenes', 'where', 'Mature', 'slew', 'enemies', 'donkey', 'jawbone', 'then', 'later', 'down', 'Philistine', 'temple', 'not', 'mention', 'sight', 'Hedy', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'earlier', 'action', 'scene', 'Mature', 'lion', 'only', 'young', 'lion', 'Samson', 'dismissively', 'script', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pack', 'wallop', 'should', 'likely', 'many', 'quick', 'easy', 'tell', 'Mature', 'had', 'been', 'replaced', 'stunt', 'man', 'One', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'many', 'DeMille', 'movies', 'spectacle', 'oddly', 'only', 'big', 'spectacle', 'Samson', 'destruction', 'temple', 'still', 'mighty', 'impressive', 'piece', 'work', 'given', 'technology', '1949', 'film', 'making', 'movie', 'plot', 'line', 'diverges', 'wholesale', 'legend', 'Biblical', 'scripture', 'movie', 'Samson', 'bride', 'dies', 'spear', 'official', 'legend', 'was', 'burned', 'probably', 'little', 'too', 'raw', '1949', 'crowds', 'movie', 'Delilah', 'haircutting', 'contrary', 'legend', 'following', 'scenes', 'Mature', 'shortened', 'hair', 'bit', 'too', 'cleverly', 'coiffed', 'having', 'been', 'cut', 'hunting', 'knife', 'Later', 'more', 'convincing', 'Many', 'interior', 'scenes', 'look', 'so', 'stagey', 'have', 'little', 'difficulty', 'guessing', 'how', 'many', 'production', 'crew', 'were', 'lurking', 'wings', 'walls', 'Aside', 'movie', 'major', 'fault', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'flaws', 'basic', 'morality', 'tale', 'ageless', 'appeal', 'Mature', 'performance', 'unique', 'unlikely', 'be', 'equalled', 'possible', 'remake', 'especially', 'effective', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'Hedy', 'performance', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'beauty', 'talent', 'especially', 'later', 'scenes', 'fact', 'film', 'romantic', 'psychological', 'interest', 'becomes', 'much', 'more', 'involving', 'Samson', 'haircut', 'scene', 'Hedy', 'first', 'full', 'effect', 'Samson', 'blindness', 'best', 'work', 'many', 'scenes', 'follow', ""'d"", 'almost', 'think', 'was', 'Garbo', 'point', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'raised', 'almost', '5-star', 'level', 'S', 'D', 'certainly', 'moments', 'saw', 'initial', 'release', 'age', 'five', 'years', 'recalled', 'many', 'scenes', 'detail', 'casting', 'young', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'Saul', 'well', 'not', 'take', 'film', 'too', 'literally', 'Afterthought', 'one', 'reviewer', 'here', 'was', 'disappointed', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'wide-screen', 'format', 'Sorry', 'youngster', 'wide-screen', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'arrive', 'few', 'years', 'later']",Samson And Delilah (DVD) Cecil B Demille - BY GOLDEN CLASSIC COLLECTIBLES

1015141,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,B000HKKY3G,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[0, 0]","One of my favorite movies finally came to DVD only to be shown in washedout color. The radiant technicolor of the original has been compromised, especially with regard to the reds (which look more brownish at times) and the golds (which have lost their sheen). I have a far better VHS recording made directly from a TCM broadcast. The story is well known and need not be repeated here. Unfortunately, DeMille's first choice (a youthful Steve Reeves)to play Samson was rejected by the studio (Paramount) which wanted a bigger ""name"" and was replaced by the always smug looking Victor Mature.  A 29? year old Reeves later appeared in the first of the many Italian ""sword and sandal"" movies of the 50s and 60s as Hercules. Imagine what he might have brought to S&D. Ironically, one of the last scenes of HERCULES showed Reeves pulling down some columns on a bunch of Greek warriors which may have been a deliberate echo of what Samson did at the end of S&D. Lamarr was exquisite in every way and was a most credible Delilah. George Sanders as the Saran deliciously chewed up the scenery and stole a number of scenes; and Henry Wilcoxon as his hapless general (a regular in DeMille movies)gave his usual solid performance. Look for a very young Angela Lansbury as Delilah's doomed ""older"" sister and George Reeves (who later played Superman) as a surviving soldier whose compatriots were all done in by Samson wielding the jawbone of an ass.
