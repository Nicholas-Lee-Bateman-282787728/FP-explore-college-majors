Uthman ""Ed""","[0, 0]","I had heard a little of Spock's Beard before and was somewhat lukewarm about them, but after watching this incredible video, I am a hooked for life. Whether listened to in two-channel stereo or Dolby Digital 5.1, the audio production is flawless, and the video direction is tailor-made for an audience who loves to watch great musicians do what they do best. There are no cheesy video effects or jump cuts, just great shots of some great playing.",5,Outstanding musicianship and audio/video production,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,446,"['had', 'heard', 'little', 'Spock', 'Beard', 'was', 'somewhat', 'lukewarm', 'watching', 'incredible', 'video', 'am', 'hooked', 'life', 'Whether', 'listened', 'two-channel', 'stereo', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'audio', 'production', 'flawless', 'video', 'direction', 'tailor-made', 'audience', 'who', 'watch', 'great', 'musicians', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'are', 'cheesy', 'video', 'effects', 'jump', 'cuts', 'just', 'great', 'shots', 'great', 'playing']",N/A

Song after song is an awesome display of musical talent and you actually start to take it for granted and miss some of the things they do!Highly recommended, especially if you're a musician. I would have liked to see Alan Morse's guitar rig just to discover how he gets some of those sounds.",5,Just one little complaint...,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,572,"['someone', 'new', 'SB', ""'m"", 'utterly', 'impressed', 'everything', 'band', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'job', 'illustrating', 'how', 'talented', 'versatile', 'guys', 'are-', 'how', 'reproduce', 'complex', 'awesome', 'CD', 'sound', 'only', 'complaint', 'suffering', 'little', 'genius', 'overload', 'Song', 'song', 'awesome', 'display', 'musical', 'talent', 'actually', 'start', 'take', 'granted', 'miss', 'things', 'do', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'especially', ""'re"", 'musician', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Alan', 'Morse', 'guitar', 'rig', 'just', 'discover', 'how', 'sounds']",N/A

You see all the riffs you'd prefer to see by any particular band member during any song and if you've listened to much SB, you understand this accomplishment. Also, you don't have to worry about the band kicking in with a killer track, only for the sound to soften to allow footage of the band to talk over it. This DVD does an excellent job of allowing the fan to imagine they're very much a part of the show. (The only thing I can find that a very picky fan might gripe about, is that when a different song is starting, small text will appear briefly to announce that song's title. I personally loved this touch and did not AT ALL find it distracting, since I never had to reach for the DVD's jacket to recall a song's name.) It becomes obvious within the first song, the direction of this release had very professional intentions.Also, as far as the sound of this release is concerned, it's absolutely perfect in my opinion. The band sounds whole, you can easily hear each instrument equally and nothing is lost in the mix. Even the audience is mixed well, they don't drown out songs, yet in between songs when the band interacts with them, you can make out fan's comments word for word! You become aware quickly the appreciation the band and the fans have for each other. Band mates even crowd surf during some very touching moments (pun intended) of the show.Next, I'll address SB fans who are unsure about getting this. I'm sure there's a handful of fans who will claim to enjoy the band's older material more than their recent. Well, fear not and check out the set list, the band does a mighty fine job of covering all the bases. Whether you're an old fan or a new fan, they deliver! There will be some favorite tracks missed I'm sure, but this show is mainly the most rocking material and it's all great live. The drum duel featuring Nick and Jimmy is sure to entertain and the abilities of individual band members makes this any musician's delight to witness.Now, I'll mention bonus/extra material for this DVD. To be honest, there's not much, but to be more honest, by the time the show itself is over, you're guaranteed to feel like you got your money's worth. There is a very unique discography/photo album. Moving in chronological order, fans get to view an evolution of the band through pictures, simultaneously listening to musical medleys from each album. It's very cool and original even if I couldn't describe it as such.Lastly I want to mention that I own anywhere between 75-100 live concert DVDs (including others from SB) and this one will easily rank in the top 5 greatest of all so far. The production value is through the roof and you can't help noticing after watching it that the band has put considerable attention, care, and inspiration into this release. So don't rent it, don't download it, love yourself enough to OWN IT!!!!!",5,Top Notch Concert DVD!!!,1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,3133,"[""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'Spock', 'Beard', 'just', 'fan', 'progressive', 'rock', 'music', 'general', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Unlike', 'so', 'many', 'concerts', 'released', 'DVD', 'recently', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'dizzy', 'upset', 'speedy', 'camera', 'changes', 'footage', 'nonsense', 'songs', 'see', 'riffs', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'see', 'particular', 'band', 'member', 'song', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'much', 'SB', 'understand', 'accomplishment', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'band', 'kicking', 'killer', 'track', 'only', 'sound', 'soften', 'allow', 'footage', 'band', 'talk', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'job', 'allowing', 'fan', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'very', 'much', 'part', 'show', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'find', 'very', 'picky', 'fan', 'might', 'gripe', 'when', 'different', 'song', 'starting', 'small', 'text', 'will', 'appear', 'briefly', 'announce', 'song', 'title', 'personally', 'loved', 'touch', 'did', 'not', 'AT', 'ALL', 'find', 'distracting', 'never', 'had', 'reach', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'recall', 'song', 'name', 'obvious', 'first', 'song', 'direction', 'release', 'had', 'very', 'professional', 'intentions.Also', 'as', 'far', 'sound', 'release', 'concerned', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'opinion', 'band', 'whole', 'can', 'easily', 'hear', 'instrument', 'equally', 'nothing', 'lost', 'mix', 'Even', 'audience', 'mixed', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'drown', 'out', 'songs', 'yet', 'songs', 'when', 'band', 'can', 'make', 'out', 'fan', 'comments', 'word', 'word', 'become', 'aware', 'quickly', 'appreciation', 'band', 'fans', 'have', 'other', 'Band', 'even', 'crowd', 'surf', 'very', 'touching', 'moments', 'pun', 'intended', 'show.Next', ""'ll"", 'address', 'SB', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'unsure', 'getting', ""'m"", 'sure', 'handful', 'fans', 'who', 'will', 'claim', 'enjoy', 'band', 'older', 'material', 'more', 'recent', 'Well', 'fear', 'not', 'check', 'out', 'set', 'list', 'band', 'mighty', 'fine', 'job', 'covering', 'bases', 'Whether', ""'re"", 'old', 'fan', 'new', 'fan', 'deliver', 'will', 'be', 'favorite', 'tracks', 'missed', ""'m"", 'sure', 'show', 'mainly', 'most', 'rocking', 'material', 'great', 'live', 'drum', 'duel', 'featuring', 'Nick', 'Jimmy', 'sure', 'entertain', 'abilities', 'individual', 'band', 'members', 'musician', 'delight', 'witness.Now', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'bonus/extra', 'material', 'DVD', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'much', 'be', 'more', 'honest', 'time', 'show', 'over', ""'re"", 'guaranteed', 'feel', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'very', 'unique', 'discography/photo', 'album', 'Moving', 'chronological', 'order', 'fans', 'get', 'view', 'evolution', 'band', 'pictures', 'simultaneously', 'listening', 'musical', 'medleys', 'album', 'very', 'cool', 'original', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'describe', 'such.Lastly', 'want', 'mention', 'own', 'anywhere', '75-100', 'live', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'including', 'others', 'SB', 'one', 'will', 'easily', 'rank', 'top', '5', 'greatest', 'so', 'far', 'production', 'value', 'roof', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'noticing', 'watching', 'band', 'put', 'considerable', 'attention', 'care', 'inspiration', 'release', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'download', 'love', 'enough', 'OWN', 'IT']",N/A

Ryo is one crazy dude and is guaranteed to make you laugh even before you reach the DVD menu.  Also, Jimmy Keagan is one amazing drummer, and some of his fills will make drummer drop their jaw (bring a drummer myself).  NVD really loves to play music, and his running around between the front of the stage and behind the kit is very impressive (and humorous at times).  NDV's voice is stellar on this!!!The production is awesome.  I'm surprised they were able to get such good camera angles in such a small and crowded venue.  The audio is also mixed beautifully.If were unsure or turned off by the new-age Spock, try this DVD.
