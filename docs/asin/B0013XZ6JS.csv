Now, how many other films have reached this `startling' conclusion? And, as for the purported subject of the film, Danny Williams? Well, he's as much of a cipher at the end of the film as he was at the beginning. Yes, his mother Nadia talks about her son, some 40 years dead, with startling clarity, the sort that is rare for a parent to have for their child. Usually, one hears gushing sentiments, but Nadia speaks openly of her son's drug use and homosexuality and....well, that's about it. The truth is, for all her clarity on what he was, externally, after the fact, she really knew very little about her son. To her, as to us, he is a cipher. The only difference is that she obviously cares for the memory of her son. We, the audience, are not inclined to that emotion since the film never opens him up. Director Robinson had an opportunity to make a film of more substance about the Factory scene, yet- either out of the needed hard work to do so, or a lack of basic curiosity, chose to just lob a softball at us, where a Nolan Ryan-level fastball (high and inside) would have been the better pitch selection.In short, the film is circular and solipsistic, even though its center is a dead man. It is as intriguing as strobe effects, after two or more minutes, and really should have been a thing kept for the archive of Warholia, not the masses. In real life, no one knows what happened to Danny Williams, as his body was never found (the film's title is based on one of the theories of his death). In A Walk Into The Sea: Danny Williams And The Warhol Factory, no one ever knows what is what about Danny Williams: man, mind, art, life, nor soul As such, the film can only fairly be deemed a failure. My only questions are to what degree did Robinson's relation to Williams contribute to that failure (a fear to unleash information?), and lacking such a relation, would there have even been a point for her making the film? While the latter question's answer is rather easy to pin down, I suspect the former one will remain as missing as the sum of Williams.",2,Ok,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,2217,"['film', 'murder', 'plot', 'only', 'Warhol', 'cohorts', 'were', 'unsympathetic', 'bastards', 'real', 'life', 'public', 'personae', 'Now', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'reached', 'startling', 'conclusion', 'purported', 'subject', 'film', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'Well', 'as', 'much', 'cipher', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'beginning', 'Yes', 'mother', 'Nadia', 'talks', 'son', '40', 'years', 'dead', 'startling', 'clarity', 'sort', 'rare', 'parent', 'have', 'child', 'Usually', 'one', 'gushing', 'sentiments', 'Nadia', 'openly', 'son', 'drug', 'use', 'homosexuality', '.well', 'truth', 'clarity', 'what', 'was', 'externally', 'fact', 'really', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'son', 'cipher', 'only', 'difference', 'obviously', 'memory', 'son', 'audience', 'are', 'not', 'inclined', 'emotion', 'film', 'never', 'up', 'Director', 'Robinson', 'had', 'opportunity', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'substance', 'Factory', 'scene', 'yet-', 'needed', 'hard', 'work', 'do', 'so', 'lack', 'basic', 'curiosity', 'chose', 'just', 'lob', 'softball', 'where', 'Nolan', 'Ryan-level', 'fastball', 'high', 'inside', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'pitch', 'selection.In', 'short', 'film', 'circular', 'solipsistic', 'even', 'center', 'dead', 'man', 'as', 'intriguing', 'strobe', 'effects', 'two', 'more', 'minutes', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'thing', 'kept', 'archive', 'Warholia', 'not', 'masses', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'what', 'happened', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'film', 'title', 'based', 'one', 'theories', 'death', 'Walk', 'Into', 'Sea', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'Warhol', 'Factory', 'one', 'ever', 'what', 'what', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'man', 'mind', 'art', 'life', 'soul', 'such', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'fairly', 'be', 'deemed', 'failure', 'only', 'questions', 'are', 'what', 'degree', 'did', 'Robinson', 'relation', 'Williams', 'contribute', 'failure', 'fear', 'unleash', 'information', 'lacking', 'such', 'relation', 'would', 'there', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'point', 'making', 'film', 'latter', 'question', 'answer', 'rather', 'easy', 'pin', 'down', 'suspect', 'former', 'one', 'will', 'remain', 'as', 'missing', 'sum', 'Williams']",A Walk into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory

Very few people from the Andy Warhol days  remembered or knew Danny William's. It's almost like he was neglected and forgotten from the moment he was born.The film drags on and on never telling the audience the few FACTS about the disappearance of Danny.Let me save you the trouble...1. Danny took his moms car, the car was found several weeks later at the edge of a cliff in Cape Cod.2. Danny's cloths were found neatly folded on a rock by the beach.3. Danny Williams had a dysfunctional family who didn't really look to hard for him when he went missing.4. Andy Warhol was a master manipulator of everyone around him including Danny Williams. Danny William's lived briefly with Andy Warhol, then soon became homeless, leading him to go home.......soon after, taking his mothers car and disappearing.5. Danny Williams was addicted to amphetaminesThe only thing worth watching in this documentary is the movies Danny Williams made (5 minutes worth). It's obvious from the brief clips of Danny's films that he was very talented.Don't waste your time on this documentary.",1,Don't waste your time,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,1243,"['will', 'find', 'more', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'investing', '5', 'minutes', 'google.His', 'family', 'know', 'almost', 'NOTHING', 'Danny', 'was', 'gay', 'used', 'drugs', 'went', 'Harvard', 'Very', 'few', 'people', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'days', 'remembered', 'knew', 'Danny', 'William', 'almost', 'was', 'neglected', 'forgotten', 'moment', 'was', 'born.The', 'film', 'drags', 'never', 'telling', 'audience', 'few', 'FACTS', 'disappearance', 'Danny.Let', 'save', 'trouble', '1', 'Danny', 'took', 'moms', 'car', 'car', 'was', 'found', 'several', 'weeks', 'later', 'edge', 'cliff', 'Cape', 'Cod.2', 'Danny', 'cloths', 'were', 'found', 'neatly', 'folded', 'rock', 'beach.3', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'had', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'hard', 'when', 'went', 'missing.4', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'was', 'master', 'manipulator', 'everyone', 'including', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'Danny', 'William', 'lived', 'briefly', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'then', 'soon', 'became', 'homeless', 'leading', 'go', 'home', '.soon', 'taking', 'mothers', 'car', 'disappearing.5', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'was', 'addicted', 'amphetaminesThe', 'only', 'thing', 'worth', 'watching', 'documentary', 'movies', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'made', '5', 'minutes', 'worth', 'obvious', 'brief', 'clips', 'Danny', 'films', 'was', 'very', 'talented.Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'documentary']",A Walk into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory

Martin,"[1, 1]","In this movie, some relatives of a minor flunky at Andy Warhol's Factory try to imply that Warhol was somehow responsible for the guy's disappearance hundreds of miles away in the middle of nowhere.It gives a strong impression (but doesn't say) that the relatives first tried extorting money from Warhol's estate and only decided to make this smear movie when that attempt failed. This attempt should fail too, joining the missing flunky in well-deserved obscurity.I gave it two stars only because it's slightly amusing that the guy's relatives would have the gall to do something so monumentally and so brazenly stupid. Warhol was a neurotic, talentless jerk, but if he or any of his gang took the trouble to murder a nobody like Danny Williams then pigs can fly and George W Bush is a genius.

1144368,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B0013XZ6JS,stoic,"[5, 6]","A Walk Into the Sea is an account of the disappearance of filmmaker Danny Williams, who worked with Andy Warhol at his ""Factory"" in the 1960s. After graduating from Harvard in 1961, Williams moved to New York, where he became Warhol's lover. Williams later disappeared while visiting his family in Massachusetts and his niece set out to make a film about him. This film has real potential, but none of it is realized.There are several interesting themes that A Walk Into the Sea could have explored. One would have been Danny Williams' life story. Another would have been the competition among the Factory's artists for Warhol's favor. (The film portrays Warhol as a Grade-A jerk who jilted Williams). A third theme might have been the impact of Williams' disappearance on his loved ones.Instead, A Walk Into the Sea just spins its wheels; the film tells all of the stories above, but it does not tell any of them in depth. The film, therefore, lacks focus and fails to answer any of the questions surrounding Williams. The viewer sees some mildly-interesting black-and-white films that Williams made, but the films will be of little interest to anyone other than (perhaps) film students; the films are silent and contain black-and-white images of the people at the Factory.For an interesting account of Warhol's impact on the lives of others, I suggest George Plimpton's book Edie.

1144369,A17AHTCKJ4SUT0,B0013XZ6JS,"Suzinne Barrett ""Suzinne""","[3, 4]","I found this film very engrossing.  It was produced by the subject of the film's sister, and through her effort the world can appreciate the striking talent of her brother, Danny Williams.  Danny was the ""lighting and technical guy"" for many of Andy Warhols' shoots, and in the course of this film the viewer is treated to some stunning film work that was rediscovered as part of the Warhol archive @ the Museum of Modern Art here in NYC.  Such was the impression of these film clips that I found myself going back and viewing them again a number of times.  One clip was of the Edie Sedgwick at the height of her ""stardom"" watching ""a happening"" while maniacally chewing gum.  Sounds silly but you just have to see yourself to truly understand the trancelike effect of Mr. Williams' camera work.  Unfortunately, his was a life cut short, hastened by the casual cruelty of New York City or, more specifically, other people in Warhol's orbit.What was very disturbing to me though is how Danny Williams' contribution to the Warhol oeuvre was so undervalued and actually demeaned by other participants.  Paul Morrissey, in particular, who apparently was in competition w/ Mr. Williams for the director role, undercuts Danny Williams to the point of ridiculousness.  It just comes off as pure cattiness.That being said, the story can meander a bit, but for those, like myself, who continue to be fascinated by the creativity and decadence of New York City of the 60s and onward, this film offers some very satisfying backward glances.",4,A Forgotten Member of the Warhol Entourage,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,1529,"['found', 'film', 'very', 'engrossing', 'was', 'produced', 'subject', 'film', 'sister', 'effort', 'world', 'can', 'appreciate', 'striking', 'talent', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'Danny', 'was', 'lighting', 'technical', 'guy', 'many', 'Andy', 'Warhols', 'shoots', 'course', 'film', 'viewer', 'treated', 'stunning', 'film', 'work', 'was', 'rediscovered', 'part', 'Warhol', 'archive', '@', 'Museum', 'Modern', 'Art', 'here', 'NYC', 'Such', 'was', 'impression', 'film', 'clips', 'found', 'going', 'back', 'viewing', 'again', 'number', 'times', 'One', 'clip', 'was', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'height', 'stardom', 'watching', 'happening', 'maniacally', 'chewing', 'gum', 'silly', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'truly', 'understand', 'trancelike', 'effect', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'camera', 'work', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'life', 'cut', 'short', 'hastened', 'casual', 'cruelty', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'more', 'specifically', 'other', 'people', 'Warhol', 'orbit.What', 'was', 'very', 'disturbing', 'how', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'contribution', 'Warhol', 'oeuvre', 'was', 'so', 'undervalued', 'actually', 'demeaned', 'other', 'participants', 'Paul', 'Morrissey', 'particular', 'who', 'apparently', 'was', 'competition', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'director', 'role', 'undercuts', 'Danny', 'Williams', 'point', 'ridiculousness', 'just', 'off', 'pure', 'cattiness.That', 'being', 'said', 'story', 'can', 'meander', 'bit', 'who', 'continue', 'be', 'fascinated', 'creativity', 'decadence', 'New', 'York', 'City', '60s', 'onward', 'film', 'very', 'satisfying', 'backward', 'glances']",A Walk into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory
