180244,A10XJR7CWHNKWU,1558908358,Alan Caylow,"[2, 2]","Like ""The Black Hole"" three years before it, 1982's ""TRON"" was another Walt Disney sci-fi movie that did not get proper respect upon it's initial release, but has developed an avid cult following ever since. ""TRON"" tells the story of a young, hotshot computer programmer named Flynn (Jeff Bridges), who created a handful of popular video games for the company ENCOM but had his ideas stolen by a sneaky co-worker named Dillinger (David Warner), who subsequently rose to the Senior Executive position at the company, while Flynn was subsequently booted out and now makes his living running a video game arcade. With the aid of two friends, Alan (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora (Cindy Morgan), Flynn breaks into ENCOM and attempts to retreive the evidence of Dillinger's crime, but gets detected by ENCOM's Master Control Program (a highly-advanced computer program with a mind---and voice---of it's own), which catches Flynn and beams him (ala Star Trek) *into* a computer, where computer programs have human feelings & physical bodies (in fact, they are the dopplegangers of the ""users"" who wrote them). Flynn is forced to fight for his life as a video game warrior in this vastly colorful, computerized world he finds himself trapped in, as he seeks a way back to his own world....""TRON"" was the very first film to extensively use computer animation for it's visual effects, and it is without question a dazzling feast for the eyes. Writer/director Steven Lisberger and his production team created a fascinating, unique, *alive* world that has never been seen on the screen before or since. ""TRON"" also has going for it a brilliant, atmospheric score by Wendy Carlos (available on CD at last!), and terrific performances by Jeff Bridges as Flynn, and David Warner as the oily Dillinger (and his demented program counterpart SARK). Boxleitner, Morgan, Bernard Hughes and Dan Shor also lend good acting support in their roles. However, ""TRON"" is not a perfect movie. Lisberger's screenplay could've used some more dramatic weight, and somehow, the movie's finale feels rushed and doesn't quite pack the emotional punch that it should. But these mistakes are forgiveable. ""TRON"" is so much fun, that I don't really mind a less-than-perfect script or a rushed ending.""TRON"" was way---and I mean WAY---ahead of it's time, which may explain why the movie went sailing over the heads of some audience members & movie critics back in 1982 (although Siskel & Ebert, in particular, praised ""TRON"" to the hilt---thank you, Gene & Roger!). But the passing of time has been very kind to ""TRON,"" as the film is now recognised as the landmark, groundbreaking sci-fi film that it is. This DVD edition of ""TRON,"" with it's remastered print of the film, the excellent ""Making Of"" documentary, deleted scenes and other goodies, is wonderful to have, but I hope the folks at Disney will do the right thing and re-release ""TRON"" back into theaters, so everyone can experience this movie the way it was meant to be experienced. In the words of the late Gene Siskel, ""TRON"" is a whole lot of fun. It simply dazzles.",4,TRON: Way Ahead Of It's Time,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,3089,"['Black', 'Hole', 'three', 'years', '1982', 'TRON', 'was', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'proper', 'respect', 'initial', 'release', 'developed', 'avid', 'cult', 'following', 'ever', 'TRON', 'story', 'young', 'hotshot', 'computer', 'programmer', 'named', 'Flynn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'created', 'handful', 'popular', 'video', 'games', 'company', 'ENCOM', 'had', 'ideas', 'stolen', 'sneaky', 'co-worker', 'named', 'Dillinger', 'David', 'Warner', 'who', 'subsequently', 'rose', 'Senior', 'Executive', 'position', 'company', 'Flynn', 'was', 'subsequently', 'booted', 'out', 'now', 'living', 'running', 'video', 'game', 'arcade', 'aid', 'two', 'friends', 'Alan', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'Lora', 'Cindy', 'Morgan', 'Flynn', 'ENCOM', 'attempts', 'retreive', 'evidence', 'Dillinger', 'crime', 'detected', 'ENCOM', 'Master', 'Control', 'Program', 'highly-advanced', 'computer', 'program', 'mind', '-and', 'voice', '-of', 'own', 'Flynn', 'beams', 'ala', 'Star', 'Trek', 'computer', 'where', 'computer', 'programs', 'have', 'human', 'feelings', 'physical', 'bodies', 'fact', 'are', 'dopplegangers', 'users', 'who', 'wrote', 'Flynn', 'forced', 'fight', 'life', 'video', 'game', 'warrior', 'vastly', 'colorful', 'computerized', 'world', 'trapped', 'way', 'back', 'own', 'world', 'TRON', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'film', 'extensively', 'use', 'computer', 'animation', 'visual', 'effects', 'question', 'dazzling', 'feast', 'eyes', 'Writer/director', 'Steven', 'Lisberger', 'production', 'team', 'created', 'fascinating', 'unique', '*alive*', 'world', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'screen', 'TRON', 'also', 'going', 'brilliant', 'atmospheric', 'score', 'Wendy', 'Carlos', 'available', 'CD', 'last', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Flynn', 'David', 'Warner', 'oily', 'Dillinger', 'demented', 'program', 'counterpart', 'SARK', 'Boxleitner', 'Morgan', 'Bernard', 'Hughes', 'Dan', 'Shor', 'also', 'lend', 'good', 'acting', 'support', 'roles', 'However', 'TRON', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'Lisberger', 'screenplay', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'more', 'dramatic', 'weight', 'somehow', 'movie', 'finale', 'feels', 'rushed', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pack', 'emotional', 'punch', 'should', 'mistakes', 'are', 'forgiveable', 'TRON', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'less-than-perfect', 'script', 'rushed', 'ending', 'TRON', 'was', 'way', '-and', 'mean', 'WAY', '-ahead', 'time', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'movie', 'went', 'sailing', 'heads', 'audience', 'members', 'movie', 'critics', 'back', '1982', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'particular', 'praised', 'TRON', 'hilt', '-thank', 'Gene', 'Roger', 'passing', 'time', 'been', 'very', 'kind', 'TRON', 'film', 'now', 'recognised', 'landmark', 'groundbreaking', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'DVD', 'edition', 'TRON', 'remastered', 'print', 'film', 'excellent', 'Making', 'documentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'other', 'goodies', 'wonderful', 'have', 'hope', 'folks', 'Disney', 'will', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 're-release', 'TRON', 'back', 'theaters', 'everyone', 'can', 'experience', 'movie', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'experienced', 'words', 'late', 'Gene', 'Siskel', 'TRON', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'simply']",N/A

Why?  Well, no one can question Tron's innovations in  special FX,  but as far as a movie as a complete thought it leaves alot to  be desired.  Though the film is visually stunning and (visually)  imaginative, the acting in this film is downright awful at times, and the  plot leaves alot to be desired.  (And has Disney ever made a film over 90  minutes?)  People say that this film started it all as far as CG  goes...true.  But is this a good thing?  Seems like this movie just told  filmakers they could rely on eye candy to sell tickets, with little effort  put into the script - this trend really started kicking in in the early  90's and is progressively getting worse.  I must use 2001 as the standard  for all sci fi films, it had great FX combined with an incredible story.  2001 (and Jurassic park, for that matter)  shows how FX can be used to  acheive a complete cinematic experience, this film just says &quot;Hey,  look what our toys can do! &quot;  The DVD is downright cheap, a la  Disney, with virtually no extras and a crummy piece of paper with chapter  titles as opposed to a booklet (which is why i bought it used rather than  give my money to Disney).  The picture quality was crisp, but for some  reason this DVD pauses slightly during chapters, which Ive never  experienced on any other DVD's I own, including the Matrix.  All in all,  its acheivements in SFX cannot be denied and must be applauded.

Well, it turns out that it was NOT just my selective memory thinking that this was an awesome show!  It is a classic bit of sci-fi and movie-making history.I recall the first time I saw TRON.  I saw it at a matinee when I was in college.  I told my friends about it...I went back again that night, and to the matinee again the next day.This movie represents a great example of the genesis of computer animation for full-feature films.  It was originally released in 1982, and now, 27 years later, it is still extremely watchable, though the special effects are extremely dated - even so, I still think that the disc games and the light cycles are the coolest!  The light cycle game has even resurfaced in a game called ""Light Bike"" that came on my son's iPod touch.  Take that detractors!One of the things that made this film memorable was not only its computer graphics, but it was released in the hey day of video game arcades.  The joint experience of this movie and the phenomenon of classic video arcades made for a memorable experience.As for the movie itself, well, the acting is marginal, but the story line is intruiging, and, at the time the computer graphics were mesmerising.

Wolverton,"[1, 2]","'Tron' is one of those films from the past that really never got a fair shot at the box office, but has cleaned up on video and now looks better than ever on DVD.  A real departure for Disney in 1982, 'Tron' is the story of Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is a former employee of ENCOM.  (Sounds a little like ENRON?  Sorry, that's another story that's still being written.)  ENCOM's CEO (David Warner) has pirated Flynn's video game software, leaving Flynn out in the cold.  But Flynn has an idea:  If he can get into ENCOM's Master Control Program, he may be able to make a few changes and receive the credit he deserves.  But things take a surprising turn when Flynn finds himself actually inside the computer system fighting for his life.The story is simple and is really quite secondary to the great visual effects.  Although film visuals have made many exciting advances in the last 20 years, no other film has captured the look of 'Tron.'  It continues to stand alone.  If you've never seen it, by all means, do yourself a favor and watch what I believe will be a pleasant surprise for you.

What was also surprising at that time was that this new advance came not from Walt Disney Studios, but from a new group called Industrial Light and Magic. As ILM developed the technology over the course of each new Star Wars movie, Disney looked to the future and decided to produce a computer animated film of its own, Tron. The great Disney artists showed how beautifully they could use the new medium by creating a vision of a living world within a mainframe computer--more than a decade before the Matrix trilogy. In the story the Master Control program of a computer technologies company gains power by drawing all programs within the mainframe into itself. Its counterpart in the real world is an ambitious programmer who rises to the company's top position by pirating the work of a video games innovator. The sinister Master Control program uses this knowledge to gain a foothold in the real world. The only barrier in its path to control of both virtual and real worlds is the video game wizard, Flynn, played by Jeff Bridges. Master Control uses an experimental program that transposes matter to electrons to pull Flynn into the mainframe world. His plan is to destroy the programmer on the game grid. But Flynn is the game master and escapes to help the beings that inhabit the digital landscape regain their freedom, as well as save the real world from the MCP's plans. Although the story is simple, it is told with a visual complexity that is still a delight to the eye after 30 or so years. Tron maintained enough popularity over the years as a cult classic to inspire a sequal over 3 decades later, Tron Legacy.

180263,AR8Y6VPVUHCSB,1558908358,"Brad Torgersen ""Full-time nerd, part-time sol...","[4, 5]","Before I start, let me just say that I have loved TRON since I first saw it in the theaters in the summer of 1982.  I was 8 years old then, and while I can now, at age 28, recognize the plot holes and sometimes hammy acting, back in '82 TRON was a breathtakingly good romp.  Since 1982 I have seen TRON literally hundreds of times.  Perhaps thousands?  I lost count a long time ago.  For whatever reasons, I never get tired of it, and while some other SF and fantasy fans can claim to have viewed Star Wars or Star Trek hundreds or thousands of times, I'd have to say that, for me, TRON is at the top of the pile.Getting down to brass tacks, and without spoiling the plot, TRON is a lot like BLADERUNNER in that it was way ahead of its time, and therefor suffered audience and critical apathy in the year of its release.  I don't think people were ready for either film, and perhaps not coincidentally both TRON and BLADERUNNER dovetail to form the cinematic bedrock of the Cyberpunk genre on the silver screen.  No cyberpunk movie made since 1982 can escape comparison to TRON and BLADERUNNER; either because of Bladerunner's grimy and dystopic future cityscapes, or Tron's abstract and surreal CGI-generated ""world inside the computer"".In the years since its release, TRON has been much slower to attract the critical and public acclaim that is now heaped on BLADERUNNER.  But the acknowledgement is coming just the same, and Disney's 20th anniversary efforts are proof of that.  The DVD set itself is a wealth of refurbished footage, more colorful and vibrant than ever seen on VHS, along with piles of goodies wrapped up in a very TRONish menu.  One can spend hours flipping through the electronic pages of the bonus CD, and some of the cut footage like the 'love scene' fills in some holes that have always been apparent in the original release.I would especially recommend TRON to that generation of movie-goers who only know cyberpunk through films like THE MATRIX or perhaps the truly awful LAWNMOWER MAN movies.

180268,A141HP4LYPWMSR,1558908358,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 0]","The 1982 Disney movie 'Tron' is a film that was so far ahead of its time that we're only now some thirty years later (give or take a year) able to finally get some degree of perspective on what it's storyline was alluding to. The computerized world we live in today was in many ways forshadowed in this ""children's"" film and one can only look back and wonder how in the world they ever knew what may lie ahead in the years to come.Personally the aspects of 'Tron' that I find the most fascinating are the religious/spiritual implications of creating a digital world. The identification of humans, or more specially ""users"" as divine, God-like beings, ""user, oh my user"", added a wonderful and complex subtext to the storyline that on can examine ad-infinitium. Coupling such suggestive, spiritual inuendos into a largely futuristic, technically oriented film was a bold and brillian move.I think the biggest problem with the film is that it has somehow been programed into the mind of the community-at-large that this is a children's feature. The end result being that those who could really understand it aren't seeing it and the children who are being sat in front of the television to see it don't really understand what's going on.

180269,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,1558908358,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[3, 5]","It's been 25 years since Steven Lisberger's TRON opened to mixed reviews in 1982. The question that remains is whether or not TRON was so far ahead of its time that it can legitimately be called a classic today.Viewing TRON in an historical context one is left feeling that the film is conceptually amazing yet somewhat lacking in both acting and plotting. This is not necessarily a bad thing just a weakness.Many reviewers have disected the plot so no further analysis is really necessary. You can take your choice and view the film either as an adventure film set in the world of computers, a warning against an overly technical society or a Christ type parable.What remains to be appreciated is the amazing technical skill that went into the film's production. This was a film that harkens back to Disney's Fantasia. It was and is a new type of entertainment never seen before and for that it deserves credit. The film effectively marries traditional animation styles with the newly developed computer animation of companies like MAGI and III into a new form of hybrid and it does this almost seamlessly. The film while slightly dated is still brillient in this aspect.The disc that I viewed was the 20th Anniversary Edition. The film is presented in widescreen and the transfer while showing its age is well restored. The Wendy Carlos soundtrack sounds fresh and crisp. The sound on the film is a little low but clear. In fact many of the problems are not fromm sound loss but from the jargon filled dialogue.The heart of this edition is the bonus features. We get just about all available materials from the creation of the film including animation test reels, extensive production drawings, publicity materials , storyboards, trailers and posssibly one of the best making of documentaries seen on a Disney film. The Making of TRON feature runs  88 minutes and features new interviews with most of the people involved and gives a generally good overview of the complex animation issues faced in the making of the film. A commentary track featuring Lisberger, producer Donald Kusner, co producer Harrison Ellenshaw and visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor is well worth the listen even if it does get overly technical at times.All in all a worthwhile edition to the Disney canon. It is well worth the watch for anyone interested in the history of computer animation.",3,Classic in the Development of Computer Animation,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,2374,"['been', '25', 'years', 'Steven', 'Lisberger', 'TRON', 'opened', 'mixed', 'reviews', '1982', 'question', 'not', 'TRON', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'can', 'legitimately', 'be', 'called', 'classic', 'today.Viewing', 'TRON', 'historical', 'context', 'one', 'left', 'feeling', 'film', 'conceptually', 'amazing', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'acting', 'plotting', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'weakness.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'disected', 'plot', 'further', 'analysis', 'really', 'necessary', 'can', 'take', 'choice', 'view', 'film', 'adventure', 'film', 'set', 'world', 'computers', 'warning', 'overly', 'technical', 'society', 'Christ', 'type', 'parable.What', 'be', 'appreciated', 'amazing', 'technical', 'skill', 'went', 'film', 'production', 'was', 'film', 'back', 'Disney', 'Fantasia', 'was', 'new', 'type', 'entertainment', 'never', 'seen', 'credit', 'film', 'effectively', 'traditional', 'animation', 'styles', 'newly', 'developed', 'computer', 'animation', 'companies', 'MAGI', 'III', 'new', 'form', 'hybrid', 'almost', 'seamlessly', 'film', 'slightly', 'dated', 'still', 'brillient', 'aspect.The', 'disc', 'viewed', 'was', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'film', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'showing', 'age', 'well', 'restored', 'Wendy', 'Carlos', 'soundtrack', 'fresh', 'crisp', 'sound', 'film', 'little', 'low', 'clear', 'fact', 'many', 'problems', 'are', 'not', 'fromm', 'sound', 'loss', 'jargon', 'filled', 'dialogue.The', 'heart', 'edition', 'bonus', 'features', 'get', 'just', 'available', 'materials', 'creation', 'film', 'including', 'animation', 'test', 'reels', 'extensive', 'production', 'drawings', 'publicity', 'materials', 'storyboards', 'trailers', 'posssibly', 'one', 'best', 'making', 'documentaries', 'seen', 'Disney', 'film', 'Making', 'TRON', 'feature', '88', 'minutes', 'new', 'interviews', 'most', 'people', 'involved', 'generally', 'good', 'overview', 'complex', 'animation', 'issues', 'faced', 'making', 'film', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'Lisberger', 'producer', 'Donald', 'Kusner', 'co', 'producer', 'Harrison', 'Ellenshaw', 'visual', 'effects', 'supervisor', 'Richard', 'Taylor', 'well', 'listen', 'even', 'get', 'overly', 'technical', 'times.All', 'worthwhile', 'edition', 'Disney', 'canon', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'computer', 'animation']",N/A

Thanks to those who do this.I have the 5-disc Tron set, so I am reviewing the ""Tron Original"" Blu-Ray that came with the set.Aspect ratio is about 2.20:1 (seemed a little less wide than 2.35:1).  The movie lasts about an hour and 34 minutes.  Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.The soundtrack is probably the best surround sound I've ever heard.  There is a lot of sound from the surround speakers, and sub-woofers.  It was perfect, and I give it a 10.0 on a 10.0 scale.The video quality varied.  Outside of the computer it was very good to great (not perfect).  Inside the computer it varied.  It seemed like there was a lot of grain in scenes that had humans.

For one thing, it uses as its background a type of 80s computer graphic not seen in any movies since after - bold neon colors on a grayish to black background similar to computer and videogames played from that period. By compare, there are 50 or more cowboy movies that are made based on a actual period that last less than four years for the Wild West theme or on actual events like the apache wars which last at least 10 years (I'm not sure exact - I'm not familiar with that period - just bits of facts from that period). The numbers of movies based on 80s theme computers may numbers less than five. There are enemies that break up into polygons like triangles, rhombus instead of dust or other methods and that give it a unique experience. It will also show those who have been born after the 80s an experience of what that period was like.Actually I was introducted to the movie after playing the game, Kingdom Hearts 2 for Playstation 2 - I didn't know it exists because I was a little kid back then and sci fi wasn't my thing.(I'm a late comer)",5,A movie for those who loves to daydreams!,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,1336,"['know', 'lot', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'movie-', 'am', 'typing', 'are', '22', 'pages', 'reviews', 'movie', ""n't"", 'matter', 'who', 'get', 'see', 'review', 'movie', 'rare', 'treasure', 'who', 'likes', 'be', 'creative', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'public', 'one', 'thing', 'background', 'type', '80s', 'computer', 'graphic', 'not', 'seen', 'movies', 'bold', 'neon', 'colors', 'grayish', 'black', 'background', 'similar', 'computer', 'videogames', 'played', 'period', 'compare', 'are', '50', 'more', 'cowboy', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'based', 'actual', 'period', 'last', 'less', 'four', 'years', 'Wild', 'West', 'theme', 'actual', 'events', 'apache', 'wars', 'last', 'least', '10', 'years', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exact', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'period', 'just', 'bits', 'facts', 'period', 'numbers', 'movies', 'based', '80s', 'theme', 'computers', 'may', 'numbers', 'less', 'five', 'are', 'enemies', 'break', 'up', 'polygons', 'triangles', 'rhombus', 'instead', 'dust', 'other', 'methods', 'give', 'unique', 'experience', 'will', 'also', 'show', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'born', '80s', 'experience', 'what', 'period', 'was', 'like.Actually', 'was', 'introducted', 'movie', 'playing', 'game', 'Kingdom', '2', 'Playstation', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'back', 'then', 'sci', 'fi', 'was', ""n't"", 'thing', ""'m"", 'late', 'comer']",N/A
180279,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,1558908358,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","Tron in many ways was supposed to be a big hit. It had ultra cutting-edge special effects for its time and the story seemed to be pretty cool. However the film, criticized for poor acting and a lack of a coherent plot made the film a minor success. Since then it's become a cult favorite with its audience steadily growing over the years. I actually first experienced Tron through Kingdom Hearts II, the Playstation 2 videogame with the world of Tron as one of its levels. I got interested in the movie so I rented it and while it's not to me buy worthy, it was certainly an entertaining film.Tron isn't actually the computer world name but one of the main characters. I don't even know what the name of it is but anyway. The Master Control Program(MCP) has been turning the computer world into a kind of militaristic world, with second-in-command Sark making people play videogames until they ""de-rez"" or basically, die. Unfortunate for Flynn who is zapped into the computer world and has to team up with a program named Tron to defeat the MCP and save computer land.Even typing that plot, part of me is thinking ""good lord, that is kind of silly"" but since I play quite a lot of videogames with tales of flying fortresses and airships and mystical beasts, I just let it slide. Some people couldn't figure out the plot but to me it kind of made sense although I'm no computer expert so all the ""geek speak"" tends to fly over my head.What attracts people to Tron is most likely the animation which is one of the first if not the first heavily-CGI extensive film and while it doesn't have the pristine shine of recent films, it's certainly quite a visual feast, especially if you're watching it for the first time. The much-praised lightcycle is just as cool as people describe it and the film's quite colorful. However I found that the novelty value went down where I wasn't wowed anymore and was like ""okay, on with the story"". Oddly enough the film didn't even get nominated for Visual Effects Oscar since people thought they ""cheated"" by using a computer. Nowadays, every Visual Effect Oscar has to include computers. Screw models, matte paintings, miniatures and in-camera techniques and stunts, if you got a computer and you're talented at it, you could get nominated.It's a film that feels slow at times and story might be hokey but boy is it a blast to watch, just don't pay attention to most if not all of the acting at times.",4,Before the Matrix there was Tron,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,2434,"['Tron', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'big', 'hit', 'had', 'ultra', 'cutting-edge', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'story', 'seemed', 'be', 'pretty', 'cool', 'However', 'film', 'criticized', 'poor', 'acting', 'lack', 'coherent', 'plot', 'made', 'film', 'minor', 'success', 'then', 'become', 'cult', 'favorite', 'audience', 'steadily', 'growing', 'years', 'actually', 'first', 'experienced', 'Tron', 'Kingdom', 'Hearts', 'II', 'Playstation', '2', 'videogame', 'world', 'Tron', 'one', 'levels', 'got', 'interested', 'movie', 'so', 'rented', 'not', 'buy', 'worthy', 'was', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'film.Tron', ""n't"", 'actually', 'computer', 'world', 'name', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'name', 'anyway', 'Master', 'Control', 'Program', 'MCP', 'been', 'turning', 'computer', 'world', 'kind', 'militaristic', 'world', 'second-in-command', 'Sark', 'making', 'people', 'play', 'videogames', 'de-rez', 'basically', 'die', 'Unfortunate', 'Flynn', 'who', 'zapped', 'computer', 'world', 'team', 'up', 'program', 'named', 'Tron', 'defeat', 'MCP', 'save', 'computer', 'land.Even', 'typing', 'plot', 'part', 'thinking', 'good', 'lord', 'kind', 'silly', 'play', 'quite', 'lot', 'videogames', 'tales', 'flying', 'fortresses', 'airships', 'mystical', 'beasts', 'just', 'let', 'slide', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'plot', 'kind', 'made', 'sense', ""'m"", 'computer', 'so', 'geek', 'speak', 'fly', 'head.What', 'people', 'Tron', 'most', 'likely', 'animation', 'one', 'first', 'not', 'first', 'heavily-CGI', 'extensive', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'pristine', 'shine', 'recent', 'films', 'certainly', 'quite', 'visual', 'feast', 'especially', ""'re"", 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'much-praised', 'lightcycle', 'just', 'as', 'cool', 'people', 'describe', 'film', 'quite', 'colorful', 'However', 'found', 'novelty', 'value', 'went', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'wowed', 'anymore', 'was', 'okay', 'story', 'Oddly', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'nominated', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'Oscar', 'people', 'thought', 'cheated', 'using', 'computer', 'Visual', 'Effect', 'Oscar', 'include', 'computers', 'Screw', 'models', 'matte', 'paintings', 'miniatures', 'in-camera', 'techniques', 'stunts', 'got', 'computer', ""'re"", 'talented', 'could', 'get', 'film', 'slow', 'times', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'hokey', 'boy', 'blast', 'watch', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'most', 'not', 'acting', 'times']",N/A
180280,A10XZH78SDOI5M,1558908358,C. Matthew Curtin,"[9, 10]","In 1982, we were given a glimpse into the soul of the computer, a view into cyberspace that was known only to a small handful of pioneering programmers. Twenty-three years later, Tron was clearly a brilliant film, far ahead of its time and showing a world that makes only more sense as technology progresses further.Tron is a story of independence in the world of the computer. Two primary characters struggle for freedom in the world of electrons. The first is Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), who works from inside the system, developing a program called Tron-a security program to monitor contact between systems and to put a stop to unauthorized connections. The second is Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), a brilliant programmer whose work-a series of video games that became a big hit when brought to market-was stolen by a greedy insider called Ed Dillinger (David Warner). Dillinger's program, a system-wide command-and-control program called the Master Control Program (MCP) operated as did Dillinger, by annexing others' work that would be useful and destroying everything else. Designed to run independently, Tron would stand in the way of the MCP's unauthorized intrusions and annexations.When Flynn crosses the MCP in an effort to reconstruct the evidence to show that Dillinger stole his work, the MCP uses a molecular transportation system to bring Flynn out of the real world and into the world on the other side of the screen. Working in cyberspace, Flynn works with Tron and a small cast of supporters to bring down the MCP and return freedom to the system.Being only nine years old when it was released, I didn't first see the movie in the theater. Four years later, I was somehow familiar with the movie and had some idea that it was one that I wanted to see-though I cannot remember whether it was for the first time. My parents were invited to a card party on the evening it was to be broadcast on local television and somehow or other, my siblings and I were also expected to go. To ensure that I would not miss the movie, I procured a videocassette tape and programmed the family's VCR to record the movie in my absence. When we arrived at the party, my siblings and I followed our parents through the process of making greetings. As the host tried to convince my father to remove his necktie (apparently having some objection to a man dressing properly for a social event), we children were directed to a separate part of the home where we'd not be likely to interfere with the heavy-duty card playing that would be taking place on the main floor. Finding an obliging television that would allow me to watch the movie even as it was being recorded at home, I really had no objection to being temporarily sequestered downstairs. I still have the videotape, complete with stupid commercials, and it is not in good condition.Tron shows computers and their programs as being far more than cold, simple tools configured to improve efficiency in various business functions. It shows the world of computing from inside of the machine, where programs bear critical characteristics to their creators and interact with each other in a complex electronic world in an attempt to carry out the wishes of their users.The film reflects a vision of computing that has been described by such pioneering programmers as Alan Kay-for whom the movie's Alan character is named, who saw the world as full of small computing devices that people would have all around them, and whose programs would work as agents that would be sure that people had access to the information that mattered to them whenever they wanted it. These were radical ideas in 1982 and it was by no means clear that people would ever understand this vision of the future. Now firmly into the twenty-first century, we can see that this is indeed just what computer technology is all about. Others were more focused on immediate problems of data processing, estimating the total worldwide market for computers would be something like six, asking why in the world anyone would ever want a computer at home, or otherwise failing to see computing beyond the set of stuff that could be made, marketed, and sold in the immediate future. In a late-evening argument between Dillinger and Dr. Walter Gibbs, the technologist who founded the company that employs them all, these competing philosophies of computing were presented.Dillinger: I can't worry about every user request that comes in here.Gibbs: User requests are what computers are for!Dillinger: Doing our business is what computers are for!Central to telling the story was the characters and their dealings with one another. Tron is a no-nonsense program, dedicated to the commission he was given by his user, Alan, himself a quiet, slightly awkward, analytical professional programmer. Flynn is brilliant and jovial (""Now how are you going to run the universe if you can't answer a few unsolvable problems?"" Flynn asks the MCP). Flynn continues his work with or without sanction, unafraid of those who would call him a renegade. When brought into the world of the computer, he uses his insights and power to do what must be done-and that which cannot be seen or executed by the programs incapable of seeing beyond the options handed to them by another. (""I hate to disappoint you, but that's the way it is most of the time for users, too,"" he tells Tron and Laura's program Yori.)Laura (Cindy Morgan) is another programmer at Encom. Her life's work is the laser that they're using to digitize matter, suspend it, and reassemble it at will. It's her work and her laser that the MCP uses to bring Flynn into the world of digits. She's smart and prizes intelligence in others around her; she's loyal to her friends and she can assert herself when the need arises. Yori reflects all of these traits, aligning herself and her work Tron just as Laura aligns herself and her work with Alan.Walter is the gray-bearded sage who founded the company but rather than spending time in the executive suite, he spends his time in the laboratory, building things. His counterpart in the world of the computer is Dumat, the guardian of the I/O (Input/Output) Tower that the system needs to communicate with the world of users.Dillinger is greedy and unprincipled, doing whatever he believes necessary to achieve his objectives without regard to his impact on others. He originally created the Master Control Program, which came to mirror his personality and began its process of acquisition that made it smarter and more powerful still. His counterpart in the machine is not the MCP itself but Sark, a program that the MCP uses to oversee all of the functions of other programs in the computer. As the story unfolds, we see that Dillinger is not as powerful as he is believed; like Sark, he has become an agent of the MCP. (""You wouldn't want me to read up Flynn's file on a VDT at the Times, now, would you?"" threatens the MCP when Dillinger tries to assert some authority over it.)What I was able to see through the characters of Flynn, Alan, Laura, and Walter is that there are people who need to think up the things that computers can do and then figure out how to do it. A year or so later, I would come across Steven Levy's Hackers and learn about some of the real people represented through the characters shown on-screen. By this time, I was already a programmer and often found myself far ahead of most of my classmates when it came to making the machines do interesting things.As my final year of high school drew to a close, I spent some time thinking about operating systems and decided that if I really wanted to know how they worked, I was going to need to do more than use operating system made by others. I had already done quite a lot with getting Apple Computer's ProDOS 8 and ProDOS 16 to behave according to my wishes instead of their usual specifications. I decided that I wanted to understand how to make multiuser systems like those mysterious Unix systems that I was learning about. After high school graduation, I set about building my own operating system. Using a strange Apple DOS 3.3 implementation modified for use on my Apple IIGS 800kB 3.5-inch floppy disks called AmDOS as my filesystem and interface to hardware, I wrote a shell program that allowed the user to enter commands for the computer and to launch programs. Once the shell was working, I created a new program that would prompt the user for a username and password; a successful combination would cause a specified program-in practice, the shell I wrote, but could really be anything-to be executed and failure would simply begin the authentication procedure anew, tersely displaying LOGON: before waiting for input from the user. I called my shell the Master Control Program and designed the user interface to appear like screens that appeared in the movie.My high school vocational training in data processing on IBM System/36 systems to write programs in OCL, BASIC, RPG II, and COBOL showed little regard for the human side of computing. It was all business and about as boring as can be. Fortunately, by then I had discovered The Network, such as it was at the time, and came to be acquainted with people who were then wired. That was the group that had vision, that was making something because of a higher calling, the sort of imperative that would drive creation-the same sort of calling that was heard by Newton, Leonardo, and Archimedes. The mundane matter of how to get paid was, at most, a secondary consideration. In that world, imagination was prized, as was technical skill. Those who would succeed would need to have plenty of both. In this meritocracy, degrees, certifications, and institutional affiliation were irrelevant. What mattered was the work.Tron was far ahead of its time; released fifteen years later it might well have become a blockbuster, though by then, much of what was being presented was becoming the obvious conclusion to the adoption of all of the technology around us. It's unlikely that I would have gone in some other direction but for the film; I had already written some simple computer programs by the time I was nine and did independently find many other avenues into the world where creativity and technology intersected. Even so, the film was prescient at the time of its release and helped to influence my ideas about computing and what was possible. If you want to understand what's happening inside of your computer, my advice is to begin by watching Tron.",4,A Glimpse Inside the World of the Computer,1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,10502,"['1982',

More than twenty years later, the movie plays more like a nostalgic ode to the early 1980s, than a simple good vs. evil morality tale. Tron evokes the heady days when video games like Pac Man, Defender and Centipede ruled the arcades and when everyone owned a Commodore 64 or an Atari 2600 -- the eight track of personal computing.Writer/director Steven Lisberger creates a flashy, neon-drenched world, a cybernetic version of Social Darwinism where lowly computer programs must participate in gladiatorial battles against the Master Control's ruthless minions. Even though the computer effects look primitive now, back then they were considered ahead of their time. Fortunately, Lisberger has not remastered the special effects with contemporary computer graphics (take note George Lucas). There is a certain clunky charm to the effects that makes Tron all that more endearing to its fans.Tron is one of those rare examples where style over substance works. The computer world that Lisberger and his team worked so hard to create is rich in detail. It also plays on our romantic notions of what really goes on inside our computers -- not a collection of microchips and circuit boards but a vast world where programs fight each other for survival. It's no wonder that visionary science fiction writer, William Gibson once commented in an interview that the cyberworld in Tron is how he envisioned the cyberspace in his novels.The audio commentary with director Steven Lisberger, producers Donald Kushner and Harrison Ellenshaw, and special effects wizard, Richard Taylor. There is a relaxed feel to the track as these guys reminisce about working on the movie. The commentary does tend to lean more towards the technical aspects of making the movie as opposed to anecdotal content but the documentary on disc two covers this aspect in more detail.Disc two features a wealth of supplemental material that was mostly carried over from a special edition laserdisc set that Disney released many years ago. The DVD reorganizes all of these extras into several easily navigable sections.The best extra on the second disc is a comprehensive 90-minute documentary entitled, &quot;The Making of Tron.&quot; Every aspect of the movie, from its humble origins to the struggles of getting it made are covered with brand new interviews with Lisberger and his crew and Jeff Bridges and the cast (minus David Warner). Everyone speaks fondly of his or her experiences working on Tron. This retrospective look at the movie 20 years later is a real treat for the fans and is the crowning touch on this excellent set.",5,&quot;Greetings Program!&quot;,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,2724,"['When', 'Tron', 'came', 'out', '1982', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'visually', 'stunning', 'parable', 'powers', 'computers', 'technology', 'More', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'movie', 'more', 'nostalgic', 'ode', 'early', '1980s', 'simple', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'morality', 'tale', 'Tron', 'heady', 'days', 'when', 'video', 'games', 'Pac', 'Man', 'Defender', 'Centipede', 'ruled', 'arcades', 'when', 'everyone', 'owned', '64', 'Atari', '2600', 'eight', 'track', 'personal', 'computing.Writer/director', 'Steven', 'Lisberger', 'flashy', 'neon-drenched', 'world', 'cybernetic', 'version', 'Social', 'Darwinism', 'where', 'lowly', 'computer', 'programs', 'must', 'participate', 'gladiatorial', 'battles', 'Master', 'Control', 'ruthless', 'minions', 'Even', 'computer', 'effects', 'look', 'primitive', 'now', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'considered', 'ahead', 'time', 'Fortunately', 'Lisberger', 'not', 'remastered', 'special', 'effects', 'contemporary', 'computer', 'graphics', 'take', 'note', 'George', 'Lucas', 'certain', 'clunky', 'charm', 'effects', 'Tron', 'more', 'endearing', 'fans.Tron', 'one', 'rare', 'examples', 'where', 'style', 'substance', 'works', 'computer', 'world', 'Lisberger', 'team', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'create', 'rich', 'detail', 'also', 'romantic', 'notions', 'what', 'really', 'computers', 'not', 'collection', 'microchips', 'circuit', 'boards', 'vast', 'world', 'where', 'programs', 'fight', 'other', 'survival', 'wonder', 'visionary', 'science', 'fiction', 'writer', 'William', 'Gibson', 'once', 'commented', 'interview', 'cyberworld', 'Tron', 'how', 'envisioned', 'cyberspace', 'novels.The', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Steven', 'Lisberger', 'producers', 'Donald', 'Kushner', 'Harrison', 'Ellenshaw', 'special', 'effects', 'wizard', 'Richard', 'Taylor', 'relaxed', 'feel', 'track', 'guys', 'reminisce', 'working', 'movie', 'commentary', 'tend', 'lean', 'more', 'towards', 'technical', 'aspects', 'making', 'movie', 'opposed', 'anecdotal', 'content', 'documentary', 'disc', 'two', 'covers', 'aspect', 'more', 'detail.Disc', 'two', 'wealth', 'supplemental', 'material', 'was', 'mostly', 'carried', 'special', 'edition', 'laserdisc', 'set', 'Disney', 'released', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'DVD', 'extras', 'several', 'easily', 'navigable', 'sections.The', 'best', 'extra', 'second', 'disc', 'comprehensive', '90-minute', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Making', 'Tron.', 'quot', 'Every', 'aspect', 'movie', 'humble', 'origins', 'struggles', 'getting', 'made', 'are', 'covered', 'brand', 'new', 'interviews', 'Lisberger', 'crew', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'cast', 'David', 'Warner', 'Everyone', 'fondly', 'experiences', 'working', 'Tron', 'retrospective', 'look', 'movie', '20', 'years', 'later', 'real', 'treat', 'fans', 'crowning', 'touch', 'excellent', 'set']",N/A

It is so connected with external events that it is these relationships that are more important.It has been repeatedly mentioned that this is a great movie.  The plot is sometimes obscured by the visually stunning graphics, but that is OK.  Cindy Morgan is drop dead gorgeous.  Furthermore this film, as good as it was originally, has improved with age, for it evokes the ethos of the beginning of the age of video games.  All of these things were amply brought up by other reviewers.But there is another aspect of these external relationships that was alluded to, but worth going in into further.  That is the relationship between Disney and this film.  This was not an in-house production.  The fact that it was made by Disney outsiders is probably the reason that such a good film could even come from this corporation.Disney has shown only contempt for the American people.  This is evidenced by the endless stream of sleekly produced, yet insipid films that insult the intelligence of the viewers.  Then there is a long history of using the company's money to lobby congress to pass laws which gutted two centuries of tradition concerning fair use and public domain.  As far as this film is concerned, in the period before the release of TRON: LEGACY, Disney took the unusual and somewhat draconian step of removing the original TRON from circulation.Disney's contempt for their audience is clearly shown in the mastering of this disk.  This is particularly noticeable in the nonintuitive way that one must use to skip the trailers.  These trailers for Disney-mind-pablum are unusually intrusive and difficult to circumvent.In spite of this, it is a good DVD and is certainly worth buying.",4,Disney and Tron,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,1796,"['TRON', 'Original', 'Classic.TRON', 'one', 'films', 'impossible', 'review', 'own', 'merits', 'so', 'connected', 'external', 'events', 'relationships', 'are', 'more', 'important.It', 'been', 'repeatedly', 'mentioned', 'great', 'movie', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'obscured', 'visually', 'stunning', 'graphics', 'OK.', 'Cindy', 'Morgan', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'originally', 'improved', 'age', 'ethos', 'beginning', 'age', 'video', 'games', 'things', 'were', 'amply', 'brought', 'up', 'other', 'reviewers.But', 'aspect', 'external', 'relationships', 'was', 'alluded', 'worth', 'going', 'further', 'relationship', 'Disney', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'in-house', 'production', 'fact', 'was', 'made', 'Disney', 'outsiders', 'probably', 'reason', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'even', 'come', 'corporation.Disney', 'shown', 'only', 'contempt', 'American', 'people', 'evidenced', 'endless', 'stream', 'sleekly', 'produced', 'yet', 'insipid', 'films', 'insult', 'intelligence', 'viewers', 'Then', 'long', 'history', 'using', 'company', 'money', 'lobby', 'congress', 'pass', 'laws', 'gutted', 'two', 'centuries', 'tradition', 'concerning', 'fair', 'use', 'public', 'domain', 'As', 'far', 'film', 'concerned', 'period', 'release', 'TRON', 'LEGACY', 'Disney', 'took', 'unusual', 'somewhat', 'draconian', 'step', 'removing', 'original', 'TRON', 'circulation.Disney', 'contempt', 'audience', 'clearly', 'shown', 'mastering', 'disk', 'particularly', 'noticeable', 'nonintuitive', 'way', 'one', 'must', 'use', 'skip', 'trailers', 'trailers', 'Disney-mind-pablum', 'are', 'unusually', 'intrusive', 'difficult', 'circumvent.In', 'spite', 'good', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A

Spalding,"[1, 1]","Years ago, the only way to see TRON was on video, a terrible pan and scan experience considering the care with which Lisberger &amp; Co. designed and filmed TRON. Now the DVD version has been reissued with a second disc absolutely BURSTING with bonuses.Disc 2 is one of those well-designed DVDs with production art, outtakes, alternate music cues, all accessible via the arrow keys. Best of all are the well-known outtakes, Tron and Yori's &quot;love scene&quot; and &quot;morning after&quot; scene, alternate end titles (with Wendy Carlos' music, not the Journey song), dozens of sketches and production art by Syd Mead and Moebius. Possibly best of all is a new, 88 minute (!) documentary on the film: great interviews, production photos, reminisces from cast and crew, and more embarrassing hairdos and fashions from the late 70s, early 80s, than anyone'd care to admit to.What makes TRON an enduring classic is that it bridged two eras of old-fashioned filmmaking and animation, with a new realm of digital, computer-generated (CG) imagery, still in its infancy. The story line itself bridged two eras of corporate computing resources and ""popular computing,"" as it came to be known. TRON prophesied the revolution in &quot;online&quot; culture and politics, e.g. corporate control versus free access, information security versus open source, and even took a swipe at intellectual property rights. Children of the 21st Century info age need to see this film, if only to realize that &quot;mom and dad&quot; came from an era of 8-bit video games, teletype computer monitors, and ... the &quot;personal computer&quot; was still a revolutionary idea.

The art of CG animation began with Tron. (well, more or less anyway...) While it's still  somewhat pleasing to the eye even today, I feel a little sorry for anyone  who is seeing it now for the first time, instead of in 1982, when it was  quite literally mindblowing. The fact that I was a 13 yr old hardcore  videogame addict at the time enhanced my viewing pleasure, of course.  Still, this movie does have a beautiful visual style that has never once  been duplicated.Here's a bit of Tron trivia: it was originally planned  to be a regular hand-drawn animated feature.Shame on Disney for chincing  out on the DVD frills.(Note: This review was written two years before the release of the 20th anniversary edition DVD, which is bursting at the seams with great features.)",4,It all started here.,956880000,"04 28, 2000",2000,900,"['Toy', 'Story', 'A', 'Bugs', 'Life', 'Antz', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Small', 'Soldiers', 'etc', 'owe', 'movie', 'taking', 'first', 'step', 'art', 'CG', 'animation', 'began', 'Tron', 'well', 'more', 'less', 'anyway', 'still', 'somewhat', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'even', 'today', 'feel', 'little', 'sorry', 'anyone', 'who', 'seeing', 'now', 'first', 'time', 'instead', '1982', 'when', 'was', 'quite', 'literally', 'mindblowing', 'fact', 'was', '13', 'yr', 'old', 'hardcore', 'videogame', 'addict', 'time', 'enhanced', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'course', 'Still', 'movie', 'have', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'style', 'never', 'once', 'been', 'bit', 'Tron', 'trivia', 'was', 'originally', 'planned', 'be', 'regular', 'hand-drawn', 'animated', 'feature.Shame', 'Disney', 'chincing', 'out', 'DVD', 'frills', 'Note', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'two', 'years', 'release', '20th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'DVD', 'bursting', 'seams', 'great', 'features']",N/A
180297,A2198FZZMTJ38H,1558908358,D. Litton,"[2, 18]","As someone who has seen the wonders of computer animation put to use in such films as ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bug's Life,"" I can't help but feel nothing but disdain and repulsion for Disney's earlier effort, ""Tron."" Released in 1982, the film was a landmark film in that it was the first to use computer animation as a major storytelling effect. By the standards of its time, it was a breakthrough piece of filmmaking; by today's standards, its technical wizardry would be considered a cheap ploy at masking its absolutely hammy story.Don't get me wrong; I, too, admire the movie's visual trickery, especially for its age. Disney has always been known for setting new standards in animation, and ""Tron"" was just another step up the ladder of success. With its striking display of colors, lines, wrap-around sound design and meticulous artistry, the viewer is essentially transported to a place that, twenty years ago, was hardly anything more than a childhood fantasy.But to look at ""Tron"" in this day and age, and compare it to the wonders of cinema that have developed over the past decade, and it appears to be a sophomoric effort, providing a striking contrast between two places in time, one when technology was just beginning to get on its feet, and one where it has nowhere to go but up. That's not to say the movie isn't well-made, but I wonder how many ""Matrix"" junkies would embrace it.To be honest, despite my praise for the film's achievements, I thought it was downright terrible. The new generation in me looks upon the animation as cheesy but commendable for its time, while the critic inside me cries out for a better, more interesting storyline to accompany the effects.Anyone who thinks many of today's films are ludicrous haven't seen anything until they've seen Jeff Bridges starring as a computer engineer who finds himself trapped inside a computer, fighting for his life against a Master Control Program that grows smarter by the day. In real life, Flynn (Bridges) is a video arcade owner who once worked for a major engineering corporation, until Ed Dillinger (David Warner) came into play and robbed Flynn of his job and his original ideas. Flynn, who has been trying hack into the computer systems, causes a lockdown of the system, leading him to infiltrate the facility with the help of friends, and thus, become entrapped in a computer.But the cheese isn't done melting yet. Oh, no. Once inside the computer, Flynn finds himself in a place where programs are ruled over by the Master Control Program, which delights in sending lesser programs to their doom as they battle one another in video games. Flynn, along with Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), break free from their captors and must find a way to contact Tron's user in reality, before the MCP begins taking over major world corporations.And I thought the plot for the various ""Friday the 13th"" sequels were convoluted. Truth be told, ""Tron"" possesses a story that is unbefitting of its visual flare, deadening any and all intensity that may have rested within the well-constructed action sequences. At one point, during a game in which players on opposite teams race in a grid-like maze, there is a slight glimmer of hope that the movie might break loose from its moorings and become entertaining, but then it's back to the banal dialogue, lifeless characters, cheesy plot twists, and a steadily rising level of disinterest in anything that happens.Besides the visuals, there is one thing I can honestly say in favor of ""Tron:"" it is the true definition of a love-it-or-hate-it experience. You'll either fall in love with the wonderfully old-fashioned trickery of the visuals and the cheesy sci-fi storyline, or you'll look at it as a bland, almost mind-numbing exercise in animated excess.",2,The true definition of a love-it-or-hate-it experience.,1015027200,"03 2, 2002",2002,3763,"['someone', 'who', 'seen', 'wonders', 'computer', 'animation', 'put', 'use', 'such', 'films', 'Toy', 'Story', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'nothing', 'disdain', 'repulsion', 'Disney', 'earlier', 'effort', 'Tron', 'Released', '1982', 'film', 'was', 'landmark', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'use', 'computer', 'animation', 'major', 'storytelling', 'effect', 'standards', 'time', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'today', 'standards', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'cheap', 'ploy', 'masking', 'absolutely', 'hammy', 'story.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'too', 'admire', 'movie', 'visual', 'trickery', 'especially', 'age', 'Disney', 'always', 'been', 'known', 'setting', 'new', 'standards', 'animation', 'Tron', 'was', 'just', 'step', 'up', 'ladder', 'success', 'striking', 'display', 'colors', 'lines', 'wrap-around', 'sound', 'design', 'meticulous', 'artistry', 'viewer', 'essentially', 'transported', 'place', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'hardly', 'anything', 'more', 'childhood', 'fantasy.But', 'look', 'Tron', 'day', 'age', 'compare', 'wonders', 'cinema', 'have', 'developed', 'past', 'decade', 'be', 'sophomoric', 'effort', 'providing', 'striking', 'contrast', 'two', 'places', 'time', 'one', 'when', 'technology', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'get', 'feet', 'one', 'where', 'nowhere', 'go', 'up', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'well-made', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'Matrix', 'junkies', 'would', 'embrace', 'it.To', 'be', 'honest', 'praise', 'film', 'achievements', 'thought', 'was', 'downright', 'terrible', 'new', 'generation', 'animation', 'cheesy', 'commendable', 'time', 'critic', 'out', 'better', 'more', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'accompany', 'effects.Anyone', 'who', 'many', 'today', 'films', 'are', 'ludicrous', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'starring', 'computer', 'engineer', 'who', 'trapped', 'computer', 'fighting', 'life', 'Master', 'Control', 'Program', 'smarter', 'day', 'real', 'life', 'Flynn', 'Bridges', 'video', 'arcade', 'owner', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'major', 'engineering', 'corporation', 'Ed', 'Dillinger', 'David', 'Warner', 'came', 'play', 'robbed', 'Flynn', 'job', 'original', 'ideas', 'Flynn', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'hack', 'computer', 'systems', 'lockdown', 'system', 'leading', 'infiltrate', 'facility', 'help', 'friends', 'thus', 'become', 'entrapped', 'computer.But', 'cheese', ""n't"", 'done', 'melting', 'yet', 'Oh', 'Once', 'computer', 'Flynn', 'place', 'where', 'programs', 'are', 'ruled', 'Master', 'Control', 'Program', 'sending', 'lesser', 'programs', 'doom', 'battle', 'one', 'video', 'games', 'Flynn', 'Tron', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'break', 'free', 'captors', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'contact', 'Tron', 'user', 'reality', 'MCP', 'taking', 'over', 'major', 'world', 'corporations.And', 'thought', 'plot', 'various', 'Friday', '13th', 'sequels', 'were', 'convoluted', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Tron', 'story', 'unbefitting', 'visual', 'flare', 'deadening', 'intensity', 'may', 'have', 'rested', 'well-constructed', 'action', 'sequences', 'one', 'point', 'game', 'players', 'opposite', 'teams', 'race', 'grid-like', 'maze', 'slight', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'movie', 'might', 'break', 'loose', 'moorings', 'become', 'entertaining', 'then', 'back', 'banal', 'dialogue', 'lifeless', 'characters', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'twists', 'steadily', 'rising', 'level', 'disinterest', 'anything', 'visuals', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'favor', 'Tron', 'true', 'definition', 'love-it-or-hate-it', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'either', 'fall', 'love', 'wonderfully', 'old-fashioned', 'trickery', 'visuals', 'cheesy', 'sci-fi', 'storyline', ""'ll"", 'look', 'bland', 'almost', 'mind-numbing', 'exercise', 'animated', 'excess']",N/A

180306,ARNEUO7BF3J55,1558908358,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","Tron came out when computers were just starting to integrate themselves into the mass market and people were humorously ignorant as to the limitations of their new tool. Movies like War Games and Weird Science fantasized that computers had near unlimited potential while Tron took it to the next level featuring an entire world within the computer. I enjoyed Tron when I first watched it in theaters and for decades bought into the idea that it was computer generated (I also thought Max Headroom was computer generated). Although only a small percentage of the film is actually CGI it still used technology that was revolutionary at the time. Tron employed a technique called &#8220;backlit animation&#8221; which was never again used, not because it didn&#8217;t look cool, which it did, but because it was so difficult and expense.The limited use of computer animation probably was a blessing in disguise. The primitive computers animations is visually interesting but cold and sterile. The Last Starfighter, which came out a couple of years later, used CGI more extensively and I was never a fan of the film because I found it lacking any warmth. As far as I can tell the plot of Tron all takes place in one evening and even the real world feels dark and empty. The offices of Emcom have cubicles for hundreds yet we only ever see a handful of workers. About the only place in the film filled with humanity is Flynn&#8217;s arcade.The biggest complaint with the film is the thin plot but that&#8217;s never bothered me. In fact I don&#8217;t even think I agree. You can have a minimal plot and still be a great film. The true beauty of Tron is in the artistry and here it shines. The main designer was French artist Jean Giraud who&#8217;s comic art and writing I&#8217;ve enjoyed immensely. I Ioved the costumes and the tanks and lightcycles. These are the kinds of simple but brilliant designs that stick with you even decades later. The coup de gras may be the MCP (Master Control Program) which is nothing more than a spinning tube that tapers in the middle. With today CGI the MCP looks very primitive but the designers used the technology of the time to produce a simple but visually memorable look. In fact I would say the MCP is one of cinema&#8217;s great villains with some of the coolest and most sinister lines ever. After the MCP digitizes Flynn and pulls him into the computer he says to his second in command Sark, &#8220;That's right. He pushed me... in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.&#8221; I can&#8217;t really do the quote justice without the MCP&#8217;s low, semi robotic voice. There is one huge plot hole. Flynn describes Dillinger as a mediocre developer who stole three games he developed but the movie establishes that Dillinger coded the MCP which is a fully self learning AI program that appears to be capable of taking over any other computer on Earth. In the film the MCP implies that Dillinger DIDN&#8217;T create him as if the MCP just materialized out of the world&#8217;s collective programs but that seems unlikely particularly since the World Wide Web was more than a decade away. More likely is that Dillinger is the world&#8217;s greatest developer.The cast is great and features a 33 year old Jeff Bridges, Bruce Boxleitner and David Warner who portrays Dillinger, his avatar Sark in the computer world as well as doing uncredited work as the voice of the MCP. The weakest performance was from Cindy Morgan who was not brought back for the remake. Like many movies this one is a product of its time. I saw this movie in the theaters so for me it holds a special place in my heart but for people raised on modern special effects it may look sadly primitive. Flynn&#8217;s arcade is awesome to me but that&#8217;s because I spent so many hours of my youth in an arcade whereas a young person today is likely to only know of arcades as a relic of gaming past. I can&#8217;t step out of myself and see the film through someone else&#8217;s eyes but I suspect if this wasn&#8217;t a film I grew up with I may be much more irritated by the sometimes dodgy special effects and first generation CGI. This is a film that still resonates with me and so did the sequel which I felt was very unfairly maligned. It too was tagged as a film with a weak plot but I simply don&#8217;t agree. I would compare it to Inception which was visually mind blowing but had an overly confusing plot filled with holes and yet somehow got much kinder reviews. The lack of financial success of Tron and The Black Hole ended any live action films by Disney for the next decade so it&#8217;s with great irony that Disney not only produced and Tron sequel but is now working on a Black Hole sequel. Maybe the two films were simply several decades before their time.",4,Underrated Classic,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,4867,"['Tron', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'computers', 'were', 'just', 'starting',

180308,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,1558908358,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","Are you one of those people who wonders what animals are thinking? Or about the inner details of weird things like beer-making? Or perhaps...what a computer and its components are feeling?TRON (1982) is your answer. It is the original geek-movie, inspiring a wide spectrum from innovations in the animated medium to theological comparisons. This film is Deeply Personal because I saw it with my best friend from childhood...the last film we went to see together, as adults. It was two years before I met my wife.In rapid-fire synopsis, TRON is a parallel-story about a video game corporation trying to take over the world while one of its founders--now relegated to the basement lab--is working on teleportation as a means toward data storage. The parallel is the story of the young scientist who decides to fight the corporation, and runs off to find the one hacker who can help. This hacker of course is the inventor of the corporation's best games. And the horrid surprise about the corporation is something we ought to heed more closely: a massive supercomputer that has gained consciousness.The thing is like Hitler-in-a-box. That is no namby-pamby message.OK, now for the deeply personal. I don't think many people of my age range would admit to liking TRON as I do. If you want original adult impressions from when the film was new: it was a blast! Sure we had the STAR WARS movies, but this was in another direction. The effects were as always a Disney experiment and only secondary to the story of corporate greed. Half the stuff they did here they did with a pencil, anyway. Much like they had done years earlier in THE BLACK HOLE.Jeff Bridges, in a very early appearance, plays Kevin Flynn, the hacker/video arcade owner/inventor/disgruntled former employee. When engineers Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora (Cindy Morgan) go to him for help, well...action explodes.Meanwhile corporate bigwig Ed Dillinger (Dillinger, get it?--a sinister David Warner) is being bossed about by the conscious Master computer program. He's also pushing Dr. Walter Gibbs (Barnard Hughes back when we knew him well) into the basement, and Dr. Gibbs in turn is hiding his teleportation/data storage results. When Kevin Flynn breaks in to steal incriminating data, Master turns the teleportation guns on him, sending him into the computer software.And there is the parallel world we never saw coming. Bytes become virtual people who don't realize they are virtual. They know they are manipulated, but they worship their manipulators (""users"")--they are stunned when they find that one of them, the hapless Flynn, is a user. What I love about this film is that they don't fall down and worship Flynn. They just say ""I told you so!!""Also significant is the exploration of artificial intelligence. Only Philip K. Dick had written of it at any length; this film probes the notion deeply and frighteningly. Can you imagine a motherboard bossing around the sinister David Warner?The acting and story arc truly sizzle and make this film. Nothing like it was done before, and if you love the nuts and bolts of PCs, or are merely a PC nut, you'll love TRON for that alone. Don't laugh at it: it is far older than you! It is older than the net, older than Bill Gates' life's work, older than home computers. Yet it shows how a computer works, it shows the dawn of modern computers and the animation is somehow Japanese in style yet sumptuous--because we never saw anything like it before. I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like it since.And I must admit that Dan Shor, who played Ram, was very sexy and appealing in this film. That was not an accident, but I don't why Disney did that with the character, or why they killed him off--maybe he represented the virtual prophet/martyr. This, for some reason, causes me to protest any relation between TRON and what we call ""cyberpunk"".  This film is way before any of that.Directed by Steven Lisberger, who is really only known for his 1989 offering SLIPSTREAM, did fantastic directing. I do not know why he doesn't make more films. He produces and writes a little, and as such he's recognized for producing and writing this year's TRON:LEGACY.Yet the understanding the Disney team brought to the film transcends all, and that is why I really love it.",5,Thank The User!,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,4286,"['Are', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'wonders', 'what', 'animals', 'are', 'thinking', 'inner', 'details', 'weird', 'things', 'beer-making', 'perhaps', 'what', 'computer', 'components', 'are', 'feeling', 'TRON', '1982', 'answer', 'original', 'geek-movie', 'inspiring', 'wide', 'spectrum', 'innovations', 'animated', 'medium', 'theological', 'comparisons', 'film', 'Deeply', 'Personal', 'saw', 'best', 'friend', 'childhood', 'last', 'film', 'went', 'see', 'together', 'adults', 'was', 'two', 'years', 'met', 'wife.In', 'rapid-fire', 'synopsis', 'TRON', 'parallel-story', 'video', 'game', 'corporation', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'one', 'founders', 'now', 'relegated', 'basement', 'lab', 'working', 'teleportation', 'data', 'storage', 'parallel', 'story', 'young', 'scientist', 'who', 'fight', 'corporation', 'find', 'one', 'hacker', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'hacker', 'course', 'inventor', 'corporation', 'best', 'games', 'horrid', 'surprise', 'corporation', 'something', 'ought', 'heed', 'more', 'closely', 'massive', 'supercomputer', 'gained', 'consciousness.The', 'thing', 'Hitler-in-a-box', 'namby-pamby', 'message.OK', 'now', 'deeply', 'personal', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'people', 'age', 'range', 'would', 'admit', 'liking', 'TRON', 'do', 'want', 'original', 'adult', 'impressions', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'new', 'was', 'blast', 'Sure', 'had', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'movies', 'was', 'direction', 'effects', 'were', 'always', 'Disney', 'experiment', 'only', 'secondary', 'story', 'corporate', 'greed', 'stuff', 'did', 'here', 'did', 'pencil', 'anyway', 'Much', 'had', 'done', 'years', 'earlier', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'HOLE.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'very', 'early', 'appearance', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'hacker/video', 'arcade', 'owner/inventor/disgruntled', 'former', 'employee', 'When', 'engineers', 'Alan', 'Bradley', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'Lora', 'Cindy', 'Morgan', 'go', 'help', 'well', 'action', 'explodes.Meanwhile', 'corporate', 'bigwig', 'Ed', 'Dillinger', 'Dillinger', 'get', 'sinister', 'David', 'Warner', 'being', 'bossed', 'conscious', 'Master', 'computer', 'program', 'also', 'pushing', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Gibbs', 'Barnard', 'Hughes', 'back', 'when', 'knew', 'well', 'basement', 'Dr.', 'Gibbs', 'turn', 'hiding', 'teleportation/data', 'storage', 'results', 'When', 'Kevin', 'Flynn', 'breaks', 'steal', 'incriminating', 'data', 'Master', 'teleportation', 'guns', 'sending', 'computer', 'software.And', 'parallel', 'world', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'become', 'virtual', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'are', 'virtual', 'know', 'are', 'manipulated', 'worship', 'manipulators', 'users', 'are', 'stunned', 'when', 'find', 'one', 'hapless', 'Flynn', 'user', 'What', 'love', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'down', 'worship', 'Flynn', 'just', 'say', 'told', 'so', 'Also', 'significant', 'exploration', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'Only', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'had', 'written', 'length', 'film', 'notion', 'deeply', 'frighteningly', 'Can', 'imagine', 'motherboard', 'bossing', 'sinister', 'David', 'Warner', 'acting', 'story', 'arc', 'truly', 'sizzle', 'make', 'film', 'Nothing', 'was', 'done', 'before', 'love', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'PCs', 'are', 'merely', 'PC', 'nut', ""'ll"", 'love', 'TRON', 'alone', 'Do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'far', 'older', 'older', 'net', 'older', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'life', 'work', 'older', 'home', 'computers', 'how', 'computer', 'dawn', 'modern', 'computers', 'animation', 'somehow', 'Japanese', 'style', 'yet', 'sumptuous', 'never', 'saw', 'anything', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'since.And', 'must', 'admit', 'Dan', 'Shor', 'who', 'played', 'Ram', 'was', 'very', 'sexy', 'appealing', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'accident', 'do', ""n't"", 'why', 'Disney', 'did', 'character', 'why', 'killed', 'off', 'maybe', 'represented', 'virtual', 'prophet/martyr', 'reason', 'protest', 'relation', 'TRON', 'what', 'call', 'cyberpunk', 'film', 'way', 'that.Directed', 'Steven', 'Lisberger', 'who', 'really', 'only', 'known', '1989', 'offering', 'SLIPSTREAM', 'did', 'fantastic', 'directing', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'films', 'little', 'such', 'recognized', 'producing', 'writing', 'year', 'TRON', 'understanding', 'Disney', 'team', 'brought', 'film', 'why', 'really', 'love']",N/A

Esteve ""Franco""","[1, 1]","My original review (for the other DVD release of this movie, and I'm glad so many of you found it helpful) pleaded for Disney to get its act together and release a version more in tune with the LaserDisc which was awesome. Instead they had released a really bad version at a very high price. Finally, with the 20th Anniversary edition, they got their act together and boy did they.I had waited years to watch Tron in widescreen again (not having had the pleasure of watching the famed LaserDisc version). and the previous DVD was a disappointment in so many ways. I mean, Tron is one of the best movies of all time, a true classic in every sense of the word. It is the first film to use Computer Animation and Graphics, EVER. The story is interesting and explores some very interesting concepts both philosofical and otherwise. The acting is not bad if at times some parts may be a bit cheesy but still excellent. The story is less than perfect but incredibly enjoyable and in many ways (certainly not all of them and certainly not the deleted scene) has stood the test of time.This DVD is what all of us have waited for, a historically improtant film in all its glory filled with awesome features we had been waiting so many years to see again or for the first time. I highly recommend buying this 20th Anniversary edition, it is not only a CG classic and true ground breaking (setting) film, but a highly enjoyable one to boot.

Lam,"[3, 3]","""Greetings programs!"" - Before The Matrix Trilogy, Ultraviolet, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Last Starfighter and CG animated favorites; Kung-Fu Panda, Shrek, Ice Age, and others from Pixar, Tron became the first original granddaddy of CGI films from the early 80's when Apple and PC computer companies paralleled in popularity with arcade videogames for users. A classic like any other but never a dated relic if you were around when entering command codes on a computer screen was the way before GUI operating systems were invented. Today some users still rely on that old school method.""Hey who you calling 'program,' program?!"" - For Tron, the story is pretty interesting about Flynn, a program engineer, trying to make ends meet as an ex employee to ENCOM after creating his own videogames, ""Space Paranoids,"" was ripped off by Ed Dillinger, an exec, makes several hack attempts in ENCOM's network to retrieve his memory file for retribution. Teaming with fellow programmers, Allen and Lori to infiltrate the MCP, Flynn gets digitized into the electroscopic world of cyberspace where programs; Tron, Ram, Chrome, etc. are forced to play gladiator videogames from light cycles to digital ring ball. Tanks, recognizers, guards, and red warriors are led by Sark to deres Flynn, Tron, and Yori from the grid as the MCP (Master Control Program) merges more programs to get bigger to affect the computer and the real world. And yet it's odd that Amazon Marketplace sellers priced this two to three times the regular store price I purchased at Fye's of $14.99.""End of line."" - The creative CGI effects were brilliant and first of its kind. Based on the visual concepts of Syd Mead, a digital geometric shaped world full of colorful electronic circuitry; blue, red, green, yellow, and cyan. Most of the actors' surroundings were shot on blue screen with black matte walls and platforms with complex layer effects on the actors.

180318,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,1558908358,Garrett Aja,"[2, 4]","If Tron has a problem, it's more than likely rooted in that which makes the film so memorable: the attempt by the movie to humanize the inner workings of the computers that, when the film was made, were just beginning to become a huge part of our lives. The main effect embraced by the film was to make everything appear as colorless as possible in the computer world, which unfortunately can be extremely painful on the eyes after a while, especially since there is no attempt to show the &quot;real world&quot; in between the extended &quot;computer world&quot; sequences. Also, the virtual characters (which are all represented by the image of their &quot;user&quot;), are quite stiff at times (for lack of a better word), which is accurate, but not always the most exciting stylistic choice.Regardless of this quibble, Tron is very much ahead of its time. The importance of computers hinted at in this film has come to pass, with all but the artificial intelligence system of the Master Computer in use today. So much so, in fact, that one can see an image of a sea of cubicles at the software company, and shake one's head at the prophetic nature of the image. And this goes without mentioning the computer animation, which is now standard for all TV shows and movies being made.What this DVD does is prove to be an incredible source of information on the film. While I have not viewed the documentary or the commentary as of yet, I still very much give the features for this set my fullest appreciation. In addition to the previously stated features, there is just about every trailer connected to the film and an extensive gallery of production stills and merchandise. Also included is a segment from a PBS program on computers, where one of Tron's staff predicts that computer animation will be the norm in Hollywood.

Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Disney's TRON received mixed reaction when it debuted in 1982, but now it seems even more visually amazing than when it first appeared. The story is slight: when computer hacker Jeff Bridges attempts to access a computer system to find proof of theft, a self-aware master program responds by digitalizing him and transporting him into the computer itself.  Once on the &quot;other side of the screen,&quot; he finds himself embroiled in a conflict between programs personfied as humanoid beings, some of whom battle against the master program's control.TRON was possibly the first mainstream feature-length films to incorporate computer generated graphics; surprisingly, however, the film relies much more heavily upon various animation techniques that give the appearance of being computer generated.  Much of the art concept was inspired by arcade games that were popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and as such some viewers accuse the film of being &quot;primative&quot; in design: after all, our ideas about computers and computer graphics have changed quite a lot in the past 30 years.  But in fact, computer graphics have moved increasingly toward simulations of reality; the complete unreality of TRON is part of what makes the film both effective and enjoyable.TRON is visually fascinating, seemingly made with DVD in mind, and I found the DVD transfer quite good.  The &quot;anniversary&quot; edition includes a second DVD with bonus material that ranges from a fairly lengthy &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary to storyboards and art designs; the &quot;Making Of&quot; is quite interesting and gives the viewer a good sense of the challenges the technicians faced in creating the film.

Yes, I'm sure it was light-years ahead of its time when first made, but from what I saw, the story wasn't very intriguing, and the acting was just plain bad throughout most of the film. Some of the more metaphysical aspects of the film were interesting, however, such as the allegorical parallels between Flynn and Christ, coming in from the ""other, higher world"" to mingle with the simple people or programs to save them from evil.  Very nice touch there.However, I find this film to be highly, highly, over-rated.  The entertainment value simply is not present. I wonder how many of the rave reviews are from people who first saw the film as children and loved it. It must have some nostalgia factor going for it.  Personally, I skipped the film the first time it came out because it looked like one big video game, and I did not play video games then and still do not (huge waste of my time).

180326,A3SP8WBIJMCMS5,1558908358,Gregory J. Bendokus,"[2, 2]","You have to understand, I was about 12 years old when this first came out in theatres and I've already had a personal computer for a few years by then (got my first Atari 400 in 1980) and was definitely a computer geek, even then.  To see this movie back then was almost beyond words, as it fired my imagination more than just about anything else had before or after.  It was a great time - videogames were taking off,  computers were taking off, and there was just a feeling in the air that anything could happen.  This film was a perfect example of people taking these feelings to their extreme and no other movie takes me back to that era (except for maybe Wargames) better than Tron does.Back then, a lot of people actually felt threatened by computers and this film did little to help that notion.  Viewing Tron today, it may be hard for the younger set to see what the big deal was, but in 1982, this was probably just as mind-boggling to audiences as 2001 was when it came out in '68.  I still remember being absolutely floored after seeing this the first  time on the big screen...you have to remember, back in '82, there really WAS no CGI and the best graphics resolution on the best home PC or arcade game was not even as good as the original Gameboy.  This movie pulled out all the stops and really showed the world what could be done with computer graphics and I feel that it was HUGELY influential in the development of CGI in the years to come.Ok, the plot is kind of lame and there are a few lines in the script which are cringe-inducing when heard today (eg. ""C'mon you SCSI data, be in there""), but I can forgive the writers for dropping a few buzzwords in the script, even if they didn't quite know what they meant.  The acting is great - Jeff Bridges completely sells the movie and is solid, as usual, and David Warner is fantastic as Sark.  Bruce Boxleitner was definitely cast against type but also did a great job and Cindy Morgan nailed her character as well.  Barnard Hughes played his usual father-figure role to great effect as well.After the lackluster original non-anamorphic DVD which was plagued by line noise, Disney has finally done right by Tron with this double-disc set.  The Anamorphic picture looks about as good as possible and the colors really pop.  The faces on the characters are a bit grainy due to the process used to make the film, but it's not a problem.  The sound has been remixed to 5.1 (unlike the 4.0 of the previous release) but to my ears, for some reason the original DVD has much deeper bass - I'm not quite sure why.  On the original DVD, the recognizers absolutely THUNDER, on this DVD, the effect is diminished somewhat.There are also a ton of extras, the best of which is an absolutely incredible 88-minute making-of documentary which was obviously lovingly prepared and is almost as good as the film itself.When you discover the actual work it took to create this movie, you realize that it was WAY ahead of it's time.  And as I said, if you ever have a chance to see this on the big screen, jump at it.",4,This must be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated.,1180569600,"05 31, 2007",2007,3063,"['have', 'understand', 'was', '12', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'theatres', ""'ve"", 'already', 'had', 'personal', 'computer', 'few', 'years', 'then', 'got', 'first', 'Atari', '400', '1980', 'was', 'definitely', 'computer', 'geek', 'even', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'almost', 'words', 'fired', 'imagination', 'more', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'had', 'was', 'great', 'time', 'videogames', 'were', 'taking', 'off', 'computers', 'were', 'taking', 'off', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'feeling', 'air', 'anything', 'could', 'happen', 'film', 'was', 'perfect', 'example', 'people', 'taking', 'feelings', 'extreme', 'other', 'movie', 'back', 'era', 'maybe', 'Wargames', 'better', 'Tron', 'does.Back', 'then', 'lot', 'people', 'actually', 'felt', 'threatened', 'computers', 'film', 'did', 'little', 'help', 'notion', 'Viewing', 'Tron', 'today', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'younger', 'set', 'see', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'was', '1982', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'mind-boggling', 'audiences', '2001', 'was', 'when', 'came', 'out', ""'68"", 'still', 'remember', 'being', 'absolutely', 'floored', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'big', 'screen', 'have', 'remember', 'back', ""'82"", 'really', 'WAS', 'CGI', 'best', 'graphics', 'resolution', 'best', 'home', 'PC', 'arcade', 'game', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Gameboy', 'movie', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'really', 'showed', 'world', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'computer', 'graphics', 'feel', 'was', 'HUGELY', 'influential', 'development', 'CGI', 'years', 'come.Ok', 'plot', 'kind', 'lame', 'are', 'few', 'lines', 'script', 'are', 'cringe-inducing', 'when', 'heard', 'today', 'eg', ""C'mon"", 'SCSI', 'data', 'be', 'there', 'can', 'forgive', 'writers', 'dropping', 'few', 'buzzwords', 'script', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'meant', 'acting', 'great', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'completely', 'movie', 'solid', 'usual', 'David', 'Warner', 'fantastic', 'Sark', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'was', 'definitely', 'cast', 'type', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Cindy', 'Morgan', 'nailed', 'character', 'well', 'Barnard', 'Hughes', 'played', 'usual', 'father-figure', 'role', 'great', 'effect', 'well.After', 'lackluster', 'original', 'non-anamorphic', 'DVD', 'was', 'plagued', 'line', 'noise', 'Disney', 'finally', 'done', 'right', 'Tron', 'double-disc', 'set', 'Anamorphic', 'picture', 'as', 'good', 'possible', 'colors', 'really', 'pop', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'grainy', 'due', 'process', 'used', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'problem', 'sound', 'been', 'remixed', '5.1', '4.0', 'previous', 'release', 'ears', 'reason', 'original', 'DVD', 'much', 'deeper', 'bass', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'original', 'DVD', 'recognizers', 'absolutely', 'THUNDER', 'DVD', 'effect', 'diminished', 'are', 'also', 'ton', 'extras', 'best', 'absolutely', 'incredible', '88-minute', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'was', 'obviously', 'lovingly', 'prepared', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'itself.When', 'discover', 'actual', 'work', 'took', 'create', 'movie', 'realize', 'was', 'WAY', 'ahead', 'time', 'said', 'ever', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'jump']",N/A

It wasn't a particularly good film back in 1982, and it's even worse today.  The computer effects, while still interesting, seem antiquated and really are only for nostalgic people who miss Atari and Colecovision.  The lead characters (except for Jeff Bridges, who is so good all he has to do is show up, and David Warner, an excellent British character actor) are boring, and the actors who play them (Bruce Boxleitner and Cindy Morgan) are tepid.  Boxleitner, who plays Tron and Tron's ""user"", is especially limited, dull as paste.  Many people think that Bridges played Tron, but he doesn't (he should have).  Morgan is cute, but she's just cheesecake here (the only other film I remember her in was in Caddyshack).  While the film was mounted handsomely (shot in 70mm), it's a simplistic film, with bad, wooden dialogue and choppy pacing.  The score by the great Wendy Carlos is excellent though, and is available on CD.Tron reminds me of The Black Hole, which came out a few years earlier and was a pretty ambitious movie for Disney.  It also had (for the time) great special effects (which still look good), but had a lousy, simplistic story that undermined the film.  The Black Hole had better performances and was the better of the two films.If you have an inkling for 80's nostalgia and video games, rewatch this film.  Otherwise, it's a really dated film that will probably produce chuckles and boredom rather than a sense of awe.",2,"OK in the 1980's, deeply disappointing now...",1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,1632,"['film', 'was', 'considered', 'really', 'there', 'revolutionary', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'film', 'great', 'central', 'concept', 'execution', 'boring', 'stilted', 'clumsy', 'disappointing', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'back', '1982', 'even', 'worse', 'today', 'computer', 'effects', 'still', 'interesting', 'seem', 'antiquated', 'really', 'are', 'only', 'nostalgic', 'people', 'who', 'miss', 'Atari', 'Colecovision', 'lead', 'characters', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'so', 'good', 'all', 'do', 'show', 'up', 'David', 'Warner', 'excellent', 'British', 'character', 'actor', 'are', 'boring', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'Cindy', 'Morgan', 'are', 'tepid', 'Boxleitner', 'who', 'Tron', 'Tron', 'user', 'especially', 'limited', 'dull', 'paste', 'Many', 'people', 'think', 'Bridges', 'played', 'Tron', ""n't"", 'should', 'have', 'Morgan', 'cute', 'just', 'cheesecake', 'here', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'remember', 'was', 'Caddyshack', 'film', 'was', 'mounted', 'handsomely', 'shot', '70mm', 'simplistic', 'film', 'bad', 'wooden', 'dialogue', 'choppy', 'pacing', 'score', 'great', 'Wendy', 'Carlos', 'excellent', 'available', 'CD.Tron', 'Black', 'Hole', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'was', 'pretty', 'ambitious', 'movie', 'Disney', 'also', 'had', 'time', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'still', 'look', 'good', 'had', 'lousy', 'simplistic', 'story', 'undermined', 'film', 'Black', 'Hole', 'had', 'better', 'performances', 'was', 'better', 'two', 'films.If', 'have', 'inkling', '80', 'nostalgia', 'video', 'games', 'rewatch', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'really', 'dated', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'produce', 'chuckles', 'boredom', 'rather', 'sense', 'awe']",N/A

Nonetheless, we watch very few films for the effects, and the story and acting in Tron are excellent.I'm a big fan of David Warner, and while he is better as someone who is of uncertain sanity (as he was in the Hornblower series, or Time After Time) he is quite good as the bad guy, both in reality and inside the computer world.  Jeff Bridges is excellent as the happy-go-lucky geek who is sucked into the computer.  I think the best bit player (and comic relief) in the film is the ""bit"", a sprite that can only say ""yes"" or ""no"".The best part of Tron for many of us is that it brings us back to the 80s when computers and video games were new.  In that respect, the graphics aren't ""not bad"", they're perfect.  This is especially true for those of us who played the Tron video game.The message aspects of the film aren't as subtle as I might like, and may annoy some viewers.  The biggest trouble with the film is that Hollywood special effects have advanced so far by now that younger viewers (for whom recent films are the FX standard) might see the effects as comparable to Clutch Cargo, and never look past them.The Bonus Features are better than many similar products, including an all new documentary.The story is interesting, and the acting is quite good.

180330,A3TRWCKDLYECZ2,1558908358,Gryphon,"[13, 15]","First, this is a fantastic classic from the dawn of the computer age as we know it today. The movie came out just after the birth of the IBM PC. Back in those days the concept of distributed computing was unknown outside of the computer room. Main frame and mini-computers lived in air conditioned secured rooms, hosting a bunch of dumb video terminals for the users.  Most people had no idea of how they worked and they were usually found only in big companies.Even today the special effects, though quaint by modern standards, are still impressive and the story line is pretty good.  But the visual concepts from back then of what it would be like to actually be inside of a computer is what makes this movie really special and fascinating.  To say the movie was conceptually far ahead of it's time is an understatement.The video quality in this version is great and looks impressive on my 65"" screen with the upscaling provided by my Blu Ray player.  Color saturation is rich but not overdone and the images are crisp and clean although you can see the black outline around each character from the matting process.  The 5.1 sound is also very clear and clean with good surround sound effect.  All in all, it's a terrific movie that all sci-fi fans should have in their library.As for the exorbitant prices being charged for the movie now, bear in mind that it is not Disney that's setting those stupid prices even though they undoubtedly contributed to the situation by not producing any more copies of this movie and/or forcing distributors to return unsold stock.  But the prices you see are being set by greedy resellers, for the few copies they have left in stock, who are basing them on the law of supply and demand and hoping they can find enough suckers who want a copy of this movie badly enough to pay them such ridiculous prices.  I'm just thankful that I bought my copy from Amazon before these greedy moron resellers jacked up their prices.  You'll notice that Amazon is not selling this particular movie; they are just providing access to other resellers who are.Actually I think Disney is being very short sighted and greedy itself in trying to prevent sales of this movie because they think it will negatively impact their revenue from the new Tron Legacy release.  It they were really smart, they would have done a digitally remastered Blu Ray version and promoted that to drum up additional interest in the new movie.  That way they would have made even more money off both products.  I know I certainly would have bought a remastered Blu Ray version and also gone to see the new movie.Bottom line, just don't buy this movie until the prices come back down to a reasonable level.  I think that after the new movie has been out for a few months, these prices will come back down to a reasonable level, especially if no one buys from these greedy resellers until they bring the prices back to down to reasonable levels.",5,TERRIFIC CLASSIC...but Disney is NOT setting those stupid prices,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,2937,"['First', 'fantastic', 'classic', 'dawn', 'computer', 'age', 'know', 'today', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'birth', 'IBM', 'PC', 'Back', 'days', 'concept', 'distributed', 'computing', 'was', 'unknown', 'computer', 'room', 'Main', 'frame', 'mini-computers', 'lived', 'air', 'conditioned', 'secured', 'rooms', 'hosting', 'bunch', 'dumb', 'video', 'terminals', 'users', 'Most', 'people', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'worked', 'were', 'usually', 'found', 'only', 'big', 'companies.Even', 'today', 'special', 'effects', 'quaint', 'modern', 'standards', 'are', 'still', 'impressive', 'story', 'line', 'pretty', 'good', 'visual', 'concepts', 'back', 'then', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'actually', 'be', 'computer', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'special', 'fascinating', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'conceptually', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'understatement.The', 'video', 'quality', 'version', 'great', 'impressive', '65', 'screen', 'upscaling', 'provided', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player', 'Color', 'saturation', 'rich', 'not', 'overdone', 'images', 'are', 'crisp', 'clean', 'can', 'see', 'black', 'outline', 'character', 'matting', 'process', '5.1', 'sound', 'also', 'very', 'clear', 'clean', 'good', 'surround', 'sound', 'effect', 'terrific', 'movie', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'should', 'have', 'library.As', 'exorbitant', 'prices', 'being', 'charged', 'movie', 'now', 'bear', 'mind', 'not', 'Disney', 'setting', 'stupid', 'prices', 'even', 'undoubtedly', 'contributed', 'situation', 'not', 'producing', 'more', 'copies', 'movie', 'forcing', 'distributors', 'return', 'unsold', 'stock', 'prices', 'see', 'are', 'being', 'set', 'greedy', 'resellers', 'few', 'copies', 'have', 'left', 'stock', 'who', 'are', 'basing', 'law', 'supply', 'demand', 'hoping', 'can', 'find', 'enough', 'suckers', 'who', 'want', 'copy', 'movie', 'badly', 'enough', 'pay', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'prices', ""'m"", 'just', 'thankful', 'bought', 'copy', 'Amazon', 'greedy', 'moron', 'resellers', 'jacked', 'up', 'prices', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'Amazon', 'not', 'selling', 'particular', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'providing', 'access', 'other', 'resellers', 'who', 'are.Actually', 'think', 'Disney', 'being', 'very', 'short', 'sighted', 'greedy', 'trying', 'prevent', 'sales', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'negatively', 'impact', 'revenue', 'new', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'release', 'were', 'really', 'smart', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'promoted', 'drum', 'up', 'additional', 'interest', 'new', 'movie', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'products', 'know', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'remastered', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'also', 'gone', 'see', 'new', 'movie.Bottom', 'line', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'prices', 'come', 'back', 'down', 'reasonable', 'level', 'think', 'new', 'movie', 'been', 'out', 'few', 'months', 'prices', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'down', 'reasonable', 'level', 'especially', 'one', 'buys', 'greedy', 'resellers', 'bring', 'prices', 'back', 'down', 'reasonable', 'levels']",N/A

180336,A3NMTMK5Z5VJDL,1558908358,"H. Tague ""nerd""","[0, 0]","Tron was a Disney production that is truly one of a kind, a classic in every sense. It started as an idea: ""What is it like inside your computer? Is there a world in there? Are there people? What does it look like? What kind of culture would it have?"" Computers were still a new and fantastic kind of machine in 1982, and it was only natural that it would lead to a new kind of fantasy, something original for people to romanticize over. The creative team behind this production took that concept and ran with it. They visualized what a bit looks like and how it behaves, they defined the physical aspects of a data stream, how programs might interact with each other, and how a world made of light might look.The artwork of this film is what stands out the most. Computer generated images were new technology at the time and not nearly as impressive as today, but that is only a fraction of what makes this movie stunning. All of the heavily stylized design of the sets to the intricate details of the costumes, which while certainly unconventional for the actors, gave their characters unique and impressionable appearances while making it look as though they were wrapped in a circuit board. Tron had a look that was all its own and no film has managed to duplicate that level of creativity since, and once you see it, it will stay with you forever.Story-wise the film is an epic tale inside a computer. It focuses more on the fantasy of discovering a new world not outside of our own, but within it. There are heroes and villains in both worlds as the oppressive Master Control Program dominates all other programs on what would come to be known as `The Grid'. It's an adventure in cyberspace filled with action and drama that you will enjoy every second of.As far as this DVD package of the film goes, it's a great buy. The picture is great, and the extras are fantastic. On top of which, it's a lot cheaper than getting the blue ray edition, and a lot cheaper than one of the combo pack that couple it with the new Legacy film.

Just the movies unless otherwise stated.Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.Well. after watching this I must say, 80's sci-fi all seems the same. But, that's a good thing, it's something thats always entertaining to watch. It's all based off Star Wars. All of it, this, Indiana Jones, everything in the 80's sci-fi genre. I love it. The plot is great, it is about a gigantic mainframe leading slaves in an order of computing inside a video game. Programs are the slaves, users wrote everything, you have to see it to understand it. Meanwhile, Flynn, this character, has wrote several games and is not getting credit for it from his boss.Characters? I like to view Flynn as the Luke Skywalker in this movie, and Tron is like Han Solo. Master Control Program is absoulutely the evil emperor, and Yori is princess Leia. The bit is definatly C-3PO and R2-D2. It goes on like that from there. The special effects, 80's were a milestone in special effects, it's just lately when people have been abusing it. I cannot believe I am looking at an old movie. A good way to summarize this movie is like playing Star Fox and watching Star Wars.You know, anybody wondering how Disney made this film, it was when Disney was scrambeling when Walt died, and they needed material without there main guy. So, they startede making Horror and Sci-Fi films...interesting.

It only had 128K RAM of memory. This was eleven years before the World Wide Web, the Internet, was available for people in their homes.In 1982, people were leaving pinball machines for video games in the arcades, such as, Pac-Man, Space Invaders and Astroids. The year earlier, people were buying the Atari 2600 to play video games on their television at home.Disney was ahead of their time in this movie.What if a computer programmer could actually play the game inside the world of his video game?  Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is about to find out.Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is about to hack into the master control at his company, ENCOM. The computer warns him not to enter. The laser-device behind him zaps him inside the master control program to be a guest inside the video game.In the cast: Jeff Bridges, Bruce Boxleitner, David Warner, Cindy Morgan, Barnard Hughes, Dan Shor, Jerry Maren.The video game portion of this movie was filmed in black & white with the color added.

Reviewing Tron even within period parameters yields equally middling results.Blade Runner, which shared the use of futurist Syd Mead, was also released in 1982.WarGamesfollowed the next year. Regarded against both of these peers, Tron falters.As a film of environmental proportions, Blade Runner cannot be beat. Not in the 1980s, probably not ever. So densely packed with texture was Blade Runner that special photographic effects supervisor David Dryer once said, ""The environment in the film is almost a protagonist."" And no less than creator Philip K. Dick, after seeing a rough cut shortly before his death, remarked, ""You would literally have to go five times to see it before you could assimilate the information that is fired at you.""As admittedly lighter fare, WarGames beats Tron, too. It's got requisite arcade games, humor, romance, and enough gizmos to impress without risking the kind of epilepsy that Tron must have induced in theaters, especially that light cycle race.So where does that leave Tron and how to best enjoy it? Well, watch the documentary first. ""The Making of TRON"" on disc two here: an excellent effort which will put the film in the proper historical context. Nuclear war, which figures so prominently in both WarGames (as a plot device) and Blade Runner (as backstory) has thankfully not transpired in the real world. On the other hand, the divide between user and computer has continued to shrink with every week. If we are not yet ""one"" with our devices, our youngest generation will come very close. Tron may therefore be the most prescient of the three films. That integrated terminal in Dillinger's desk? It's *still* ultra cool.Sure, some of Tron's acting is overdone. And to be fair, those scenes in the final third drag a little, especially on the long journey aboard the solar sailer. But just like the astronauts who may (ormay not) have gone to the moon using the power of a Casio calculator, the mere existence of Tron is testament to director Steven Lisberger's vision and the work of his creative team. Shooting the (in-computer) scenes in black & white, then hand coloring every.single.frame? Wow.1982 was a tough year to be a sci-fi film. It wasn't just Blade Runner and Tron. ET and Poltergeist were also released that year. Perhaps it was all too much for 1982's audiences to handle. Tron wasn't even nominated for the visual effects Oscar! With the passage of time, the story in Tron has become appreciable, if not completely believable.

It's also clearly meant to be a family friendly film with fairly simplistic characters and an interesting, if somewhat dated and perhaps unimaginative plot.  Of course, that's also based on the concept that computers trying to take over the world and killing people, and people being trapped in computers (or simulations) seems over-done by today's standards.  Back when the film was created the ideas were fresh and new, and the film definitely had heavy influences on such films as Terminator (MCP vs Skynet), and The Matrix (people trapped in a computer ""simulation"").If you like the Tron movie, this is an excellent collection. Although it's somewhat disappointing that it doesn't have a digital copy, the Blu-ray version does have a lot of extras that somewhat make up for this omission.

The special effects in this movie were great for the time period in which it was made.  A lot of times the images appear cartoonish, but that's to be expected from an early '80s Disney movie.  The acting is OK.  The musical score is OK.  I like this original movie better than the remake from a few years ago.  One thing I noticed during the movie is that the object that is shaped like a butterfly that flies in a straight line many times throughout the movie looks a lot like Count Dooku's spaceship from Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones.  Or should I say that Dooku's spaceship looks like this object from Tron.  I also noticed that the sound of Dooku's spaceship sounds like some of the sound effects from Tron when this butterfly shaped object is on screen.

Griffith, who showed that the audience was capable of following two and three plots within a movie (Birth of a Nation), Tron was truly one of the first steps toward combining technology and storyline that challenged not only the intelligence, but the eye's ability to absorb truly visual interpretation.The only ones who saw what was coming were the geeks and pinheads, and we bought the VHS, the Disc (yeah, the big album looking one) and for a short period of time, you could get it on DVD for 5 bucks at Blockbuster with a free popcorn, coke and a box of candy!We bought the DVD, and told the clerk that we would have bought this without the frilly food.

180369,A3SJ5A6L2FRGGW,1558908358,Keith_Joseph,"[3, 3]","My son (8) quite enjoyed watching this movie, but probably I wanted to see it more having enjoyed it at the movies back in 1982. The actual film doesn't seem any better than I remember it in terms of picture quality, although apparently Wendy (Walter) Carlos's film score has been recovered as the original analogue master tapes had badly degraded. This 20th anniversary edition also has a second DVD of stills, inspirational designs by artists Syd Mead, Peter Lloyd and Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud, and a new 88 minute documentary `The making of TRON' that is far more interesting to adults than kids. The documentary goes on a bit but has cast interviews etc. and is worth a view. Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner (TRON) are very good considering they were the first to act against a blue screen for mostly the whole movie. David Warner is excellent as MCP and Sark, reprising his equally superb role as The Evil Genius in The Time Bandits (1981). Peter O'Toole had turned down his role (as he didn't fancy acting against a blue screen). TRON is actually a Hewlett Packard BASIC simple debugging command of the period, and stands aptly for ""Trace On"". So as we all know, ""That's TRON. He fights for the users"". Let's hope he's still out there. Interestingly, first use of the term `Users' has been credited to this influential movie.A sequel called TRON 2.0 was in the works, but only the visually outstanding computer game version was released in 2003. Despite it's innovation, on release TRON did relatively badly in the cinema (where it looked at its best), and ironically the well received TRON arcade game spin-offs made the most profit. Rumour has it that traditional Disney animators refused to work on this movie because they feared that computers would put them out of business. In fact, 22 years later Disney closed its hand-drawn animation studio in favour of CGI animation, following the rise of Pixar. TRON wasn't considered for an academy award for `animation' at the time, as it was felt that computer aided design cheated (it was nominated for both Best Costume and ironically Sound). In the ""solar sail-ship"" sequence, look out and see, for a brief moment, the cross-hatched silhouette of Mickey Mouse on the ground made to look like part of the terrain.So the films worth owning as an historical cinema milestone, although the plot was a bit ahead of its time as many preteen boys, the target audience, naturally weren't quite so into computers and game consoles back then, and arcade games tended to be in 18+ locations. However it s well worth another watch, and the storyline can still hold most boys attention for one viewing (try renting if you don't want to buy even at this knock down price). The film is clearly the grand daddy of the films like Spy Kids III and Scooby and the Cyber Chase, and is probably better than both.",5,Very stylish SciFi thriller - 25 years old and looking good,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,2847,"['son', '8', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'probably', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'back', '1982', 'actual', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'better', 'remember', 'terms', 'picture', 'quality', 'apparently', 'Wendy', 'Walter', 'Carlos', 'film', 'score', 'been', 'recovered', 'original', 'analogue', 'master', 'tapes', 'had', 'badly', 'degraded', '20th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'also', 'second', 'DVD', 'stills', 'inspirational', 'designs', 'artists', 'Syd', 'Mead', 'Peter', 'Lloyd', 'Jean', 'Moebius', 'Giraud', 'new', '88', 'minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'TRON', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'adults', 'kids', 'documentary', 'bit', 'cast', 'interviews', 'etc', 'view', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'TRON', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'considering', 'were', 'first', 'act', 'blue', 'screen', 'mostly', 'whole', 'movie', 'David', 'Warner', 'excellent', 'MCP', 'Sark', 'reprising', 'equally', 'superb', 'role', 'Evil', 'Genius', 'Time', 'Bandits', '1981', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'had', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'fancy', 'acting', 'blue', 'screen', 'TRON', 'actually', 'Hewlett', 'Packard', 'BASIC', 'simple', 'debugging', 'command', 'period', 'aptly', 'Trace', 'So', 'know', 'TRON', 'users', 'Let', 'hope', 'still', 'out', 'there', 'Interestingly', 'first', 'use', 'term', 'Users', 'been', 'credited', 'influential', 'movie.A', 'sequel', 'called', 'TRON', '2.0', 'was', 'works', 'only', 'visually', 'outstanding', 'computer', 'game', 'version', 'was', 'released', '2003', 'innovation', 'release', 'TRON', 'did', 'relatively', 'badly', 'cinema', 'where', 'looked', 'best', 'ironically', 'well', 'received', 'TRON', 'arcade', 'game', 'spin-offs', 'made', 'most', 'profit', 'Rumour', 'traditional', 'Disney', 'animators', 'refused', 'work', 'movie', 'feared', 'computers', 'would', 'put', 'business', 'fact', '22', 'years', 'later', 'Disney', 'closed', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'studio', 'favour', 'CGI', 'animation', 'following', 'rise', 'Pixar', 'TRON', 'was', ""n't"", 'considered', 'academy', 'award', 'animation', 'time', 'was', 'felt', 'computer', 'aided', 'design', 'cheated', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Costume', 'ironically', 'Sound', 'solar', 'sail-ship', 'sequence', 'look', 'out', 'see', 'brief', 'moment', 'cross-hatched', 'silhouette', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'ground', 'made', 'look', 'part', 'terrain.So', 'films', 'worth', 'owning', 'historical', 'cinema', 'milestone', 'plot', 'was', 'bit', 'ahead', 'time', 'many', 'preteen', 'boys', 'target', 'audience', 'naturally', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'computers', 'game', 'consoles', 'back', 'then', 'arcade', 'games', 'tended', 'be', '18+', 'locations', 'However', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'storyline', 'can', 'still', 'hold', 'most', 'boys', 'attention', 'one', 'viewing', 'try', 'renting', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'even', 'knock', 'down', 'price', 'film', 'clearly', 'grand', 'daddy', 'films', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'III', 'Scooby', 'Cyber', 'Chase', 'probably', 'better']",N/A

First of all, it's easy with our modern ILM and digital masterpieces like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, Jurassic Park, etc. to criticize a movie made in 1982 but the bottom line is that the effects, for its time, were amazing!! I remember as a kid watching this movie with my mouth hanging open. I watched it, as a matter of fact, this week, on DVD and it still impresses me.The key to being thoughtful and critical of movies is to be able to watch them in the context of their time.  I could easily watch Star Trek episodes and say, ""ha!! Look at that! Since our FX are so much better now days, that series isn't even relevent!!"" That's, in a nutshell, what I read one reviewer saying, that the FX of Tron are corney by modern standards to it's irrelevent. Not at all.....I think the plot, and keep in mind this IS a Disney movie, though simple, is a good one.  It deals with a big brother government that wants to make everyone think the same, live under one rule, if you're not with us you're against us, etc. kind of government. To be in good standing with the Master Control, one must not believe in the ""users,"" or, to the computer programs, 'God.'  So, atheism is the key to getting good training, promotion and success.  Those who oppose the MCP are treated like Roman Gladiators only to perish.  Flynn takes on an incarnation of sorts becoming a ""user"" and a ""program"" almost resembling a kind of computer Christ. Very interesting notion.  Neat parallel.  The movie if full of Christian-type allegories and overall is very entertaining.There is no sex, hurtful violence or garbage.

Steven Lisberger's second film shows the director's lack of talent for sharp pacing and original screenplay.

The story is simple. Man verses Machine. Creator verses creation. Sound familiar?Jeff Bridges leads the cast of a very young group of newcomer actors  - Bruce Boxlightner and Cindy Morgan up against some veteran performers like Bernard Hughs and England's very own David Warner (Star Trek V &amp; VI and Time Bandits). Jeff Bridges is outstanding!The visuals are breath taking and the design is very unique. A look inside the computer and all its parts is what this film proposes. The Light cycles are the best. It has some ""Disneyesque"" points to it. There is Friendship and loyalty and even love. (Among programs!)The DVD extras are definitely worth it.

180391,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,1558908358,Matthew Kresal,"[0, 0]","If you were amongst those who saw Tron: Legacy in theaters or on DVD, you may be curious to see its predecessor that came out 28 years earlier. Hard to find a few months ago, the original Tron was finally released again by Disney back in April to coincide with the DVD release of Legacy. So how does it hold up?For starters it has a pretty good cast. Leading the cast is Jeff Bridges as computer programmer turned arcade-owing hacker Kevin Flynn whose attempts to prove that his work was stolen by a rival programmer leads to him being sent into the digital world of the movie. Bridges gives Flynn an eccentric yet everyman quality that, while perhaps not serving the character best in the opening part of the movie, works perfectly when the character of Flynn ends up trying to make sense of the digital world he finds himself in. Bruce Boxleitner plays computer programmer Alan Bradley and his creation: the heroic security program named Tron. The two are very different characters and at times it is hard to believe that are being played by the same actor because of the huge differences between them. Aiding them in both the real and digital world are Cindy Morgan (as Lora and Yori) and Barnard Hughes (as Dr. Walter Gibbs and Dumont) who, like Boxleitner, find ways of making each of their characters different from the other. Opposing them, and perhaps giving the best performances in the movie, is David Warner as program stealing executive Ed Dillinger in the real world as being both the digital world menace of Sark and the electronically distorted voice of the the dictatorial Master Control Program. Put all these actors together and the result is that they give this digitally set movie a human grounding.Which brings us to perhaps the most iconic part of the movie: the digital world the majority of the movie takes place in. Given that the nearly thirty years that have passed since the movie was made have seen a true revolution in special effects, one might expect that the effects (including some of the earliest CGI effects) would look rather passe now. The truth of the matter is in fact quite different: the digital world of Tron  is a truly immersive, and highly original, one.The production design, costumes and effects all go towards creating that unique world. The production design imagines a digital world that is both alien and yet familiar with its take on tanks, ships and perhaps most famously cars in the form of light cycles. Then there are all of the unique costumes of the digital characters with their stark whiteness contrasted by the illuminations of the apparent circuitry on them with a truly unusual look being the result. Last but not least on this list is all of the effects work. The effects would seemingly be the most dated part of the original Tron and to some extent this is true on the surface. But if you scratch below the surface you'll discover that those seemingly dated effects are surprisingly effective. Two perfect examples can be found in the light cycle gaming sequence where there is a point of view shot that gives the viewer a true sensation of speeding along a maze of lines or during the chase sequence that follows directly on from it when the ""camera"" follows two ships that are pursuing the escaping light cycles. If you are however looking at the effects of the movie cynically from the viewpoint of today's CGI here is another way of looking at them within the logic of the movie: the film is set and uses early 1980s computers and therefore it makes perfect sense that the digital world reflects the technology of the time rather the more advanced and evolved digital world seen in Legacy. Back to the main point though: the result of all these elements put together is that the digital world setting of the film remains both unique and immersive almost thirty years on.No review of the film though would be complete without a discussion of its script or storyline. The basic plot of Tron are quite simplistic: in the real world Flynn is trying to prove that Dillinger stole his programs to further his own career while in the digital world Flynn and Tron end up on a quest to save to free that world from the tyrannical reign of Dillinger's Master Control Program and its minion Sark. The dialogue too is more often then not as simplistic as the plot and can be at times either corny or cringe-worthy. Yet Tron's script and story are full of fascinating ideas: Programs acting as avatars of their programmers with deletions being their literal death (or derezzing), information and programs being sent along by incredible vehicles with energy or light used as paths, and even religious undertones to the relationship of programs to their users which features throughout the film is various character discussions and is best illustrated in the scene where Tron communicates with his user Alan Bradley. As a result Tron on the script and story level is very much driven by its ideas rather then its own plot.While it may be lacking in plot, Tron makes up for that in other ways. That includes the cast which makes the most of the duel roles that most of them have. Where it does that mainly though is in the immersive digital world it is set in and the ideas that lie behind it. Tron therefore is perhaps more a triumph of style over substance but it more then makes up for that fact.",4,Tron Version 1.0,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,5354,"['were', 'amongst', 'who', 'saw',

Collins ""ScorpioGeek""","[1, 1]","In 1982, when I was just 16 years old, I was one of the 16 TRON Tournament finalists who played the final TRON rounds in New York's Madison Square Garden. I know; big deal. But it is because of this that this movie will always have a special place in my heart, and it still conjures good memories with each viewing all these years later.My appreciation for the movie is also bolstered since I sat in the screening room - watching the very first public viewing of the movie ever with the other tournament contestants - with the movie's actors just a few feet away. Jeff Bridges (Flynn/Clu), Bruce Boxleitner (Bradley/Tron), David Warner (Dillinger/Sark/MCP) and Cindy Morgan (Lora/Yori) and several others - they were all there. And the special effects and story were mind blowing - they were nothing like I, nor anyone else, had ever seen.Sure, the movie definitely has its shortcomings by today's standards, and it was not the financial hit Disney wanted - and needed. Perhaps worst of all, it really was the special effects that carried the movie. The acting and story were both good, but no one understood them. I still have dozens of newspaper clippings panning the movie's story line because of this, and probably just as many predicting Disney's financial demise for investing so heavily in such an untested story line and technological approach.Basically, if you were an adult in 1982, you probably didn't like the movie. If you were a tech-savvy kid, it was the best movie ever - at least it was to me at the time - and a sign of things to come.By why was that? Remember, the movie was full of terms like ""bits"" and ""bytes"" and ""CPU"" which meant very little to most of the people walking the planet at the time. But we hear them all the time now. And it didn't help that several of the actors were playing dual roles with alter ego names like ""Tron"", ""Clu"" and ""Sark"". Being a young video game player then, I understood the terminology and concept, but my parents, who were about 40 years old then, didn't get it at all. It broke my heart when my dad stood up when the lights came on and said he hated it. Many of the movie's own investors hated it, too, probably for the same reason.But technological movies and items are de rigueur these days, and I think that makes this story easier to understand in the contemporary world.With all that said, the movie is an '80s time capsule to be appreciated now like ""Back to the Future"", ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"", etc. Don't take it too seriously; just enjoy it for all of its Reagan Era goodness.",5,1982 TRON Tournament Contestant Loves TRON,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,2580,"['1982', 'when', 'was', 'just', '16', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'one', '16', 'TRON', 'Tournament', 'finalists', 'who', 'played', 'final', 'TRON', 'rounds', 'New', 'York', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'know', 'big', 'deal', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'still', 'good', 'memories', 'viewing', 'years', 'later.My', 'appreciation', 'movie', 'also', 'bolstered', 'sat', 'screening', 'room', 'watching', 'very', 'first', 'public', 'viewing', 'movie', 'ever', 'other', 'tournament', 'contestants', 'movie', 'actors', 'just', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Flynn/Clu', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'Bradley/Tron', 'David', 'Warner', 'Dillinger/Sark/MCP', 'Cindy', 'Morgan', 'Lora/Yori', 'several', 'others', 'were', 'there', 'special', 'effects', 'story', 'were', 'mind', 'blowing', 'were', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'else', 'had', 'ever', 'seen.Sure', 'movie', 'definitely', 'shortcomings', 'today', 'standards', 'was', 'not', 'financial', 'hit', 'Disney', 'wanted', 'needed', 'Perhaps', 'worst', 'really', 'was', 'special', 'effects', 'carried', 'movie', 'acting', 'story', 'were', 'good', 'one', 'understood', 'still', 'have', 'dozens', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'panning', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'predicting', 'Disney', 'financial', 'demise', 'investing', 'so', 'heavily', 'such', 'untested', 'story', 'line', 'technological', 'approach.Basically', 'were', 'adult', '1982', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'were', 'tech-savvy', 'kid', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'least', 'was', 'time', 'sign', 'things', 'come.By', 'why', 'was', 'Remember', 'movie', 'was', 'full', 'terms', 'bits', 'bytes', 'CPU', 'meant', 'very', 'little', 'most', 'people', 'walking', 'planet', 'time', 'hear', 'time', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'several', 'actors', 'were', 'playing', 'dual', 'roles', 'alter', 'ego', 'names', 'Tron', 'Clu', 'Sark', 'Being', 'young', 'video', 'game', 'player', 'then', 'understood', 'terminology', 'concept', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'about', '40', 'years', 'old', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'broke', 'heart', 'when', 'dad', 'stood', 'up', 'when', 'lights', 'came', 'said', 'hated', 'Many', 'movie', 'own', 'investors', 'hated', 'too', 'probably', 'same', 'reason.But', 'technological', 'movies', 'items', 'are', 'de', 'rigueur', 'days', 'think', 'story', 'easier', 'understand', 'contemporary', 'world.With', 'said', 'movie', ""'80s"", 'time', 'capsule', 'be', 'appreciated', 'now', 'Back', 'Future', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Ferris', 'Buellers', 'Day', 'Off', 'etc', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'just', 'enjoy', 'Reagan', 'Era', 'goodness']",N/A

180398,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,1558908358,mirasreviews,"[2, 4]","When ""Tron"" hit movie theaters in 1982, it wowed a lot of critics by placing human actors in a computer-generated environment. Actually, some of it is back-lit animation, but that was a convincing stand-in for the digital world. I wasn't especially impressed at the time. It looked like a video game, as was intended -that was the novelty. Stephen Lisberger wrote and directed the film, which was inspired by the game Pong. It looks it. I've been re-watching iconic films from the 1980s to see how they have held up. ""Tron"" wasn't one that I liked in the first place, but, ironically, it has taken on new meaning with the passage of time.Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), is trying to break into the computer of his former employer, Encom, whose CEO Mr. Dillinger (David Warner) stole several video games that Flynn wrote and used them to advance his career. Flynn is looking for evidence of his authorship, aided by Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora Baines (Cindy Morgan), scientists who still work for Encom. But his efforts have been repelled by Master Control, Encom's ambitious security program. Alan has written ""Tron"", a program which he hopes can infiltrate Master Control. But when Flynn's attack becomes threatening, Master Control zaps him with a beam that turns the man into a computer program, at Master Control's mercy.The story is incoherent and silly. A lot of scenes serve no narrative purpose. The visuals were unusual for a movie at the time but were never interesting in themselves. The attempt to fuse photographic images of actors with digital animation is funny, perhaps because filmmakers have still not gotten that quite right. George Lucas' and Stephen Spielberg's effrots in this area still look like video games with humans walking around in them. The depth of field never seems to match up correctly, among other issues. The imagery in ""Tron"" is, mercifully, unsophisticated enough not to be bedeviled by these finer points.Thematically, ""Tron"" is more interesting. It exists somewhere between ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and ""The Matrix"" (1999) is its concept of powerful, all-knowing, all-controlling computers. Master Control's personality is that of a heavy-handed, militant HAL. It terrorizes humans and machines alike. It entertains a grand ambition to hijack all government and corporate computers, because Master Control fancies himself better than humans, who have become his toys. From inside Encom's computer, Flynn, aided by Tron and a program called Yori, must destroy Master Control and free cyberspace from its dominion. Sounds like ""The Matrix"".The casting of Jeff Bridges is odd. Flynn is a god, a ""user"", fallen to earth, or cyberspace, to free the masses, but  Flynn's personality does not resemble any computer geek I've ever met. This was before geeks were allowed in movies. Back then, coders were still called ""programmers"". That ""Tron"" was a pioneer effort in digital animation is undisputed. But, ultimately, the tediousness of the whole thing does not allow me to give the movie more than 3 stars. It's not great entertainment. It takes some effort to stay awake for the duration.

My above title, is not meant to be insulting...actually it's dialogue from a great &quot;Simpsons&quot; Halloween episode where Homer crosses over to another dimension, which reminds him of Tron.  When he asks if anybody saw the movie, only Chief Wiggum says Yes, then pauses and says, &quot;I mean, no&quot;, as if to imply that many of us love Tron, but are just afraid to admit it, probably because the movie was not a success.Like many others, I felt the DVD release was good and bad.  Good, being that the picture and sound quality were very impressive.  Bad, being that Disney had released a very, very expensive Laserdisc edition of Tron which included a ton of extras, and none of them made it on the DVD except for the trailer.  But I think, hopefully, now that Disney is beginning to come around in the DVD universe, a Special Edition release seems a likely possibility.  The only question is, how long will it take for them to get around to releasing it?  It really shouldn't take long.  Why?  The special features have already been made (for the CAV laserdisc: deleted scenes, pre-production animation tests, soundtrack music deleted from the film, excerpts from two behind-the-scenes documentaries, theatrical trailers, concept art, storyboards, publicity materials, computer animation demo reels, and more) they'd just need to transfer them to the DVD and that's it.  Unless they want to add something more, like a cool audio commentary with Jeff Bridges &amp; Bruce Boxleitner.  I would love an Isolated Score of the wonderful music by Wendy Carlos, which has never been released on compact disc and is out of print in all other formats.  But perhaps the fact that the film was not a hit in theaters is the reason for the delay of a new release?  Maybe Disney doesn't think it will make enough money to justify making it.

I would first see it on VHS. The video's blury 4:3 transfer didn't do the film justice. Years later I saw it on Laserdisc. The picture was much better, but still failed to reproduce the amount of detail the film had theatrically. Up until this weeks blu ray release, the best version of the film was the 20th Anniverary 2 Disc DVD. It was the first true 16:9 transfer of the film for home video. It was the closest I've been to seeing TRON projected and one of my favorite DVDs. But as beautiful as the DVD is, the blu ray puts it to shame. I played both discs side by side and the blu ray looks like a brand new film. Colors are brighter. Details are clearer. The biggest improvement is how clean it looks. The DVD has alot of noticable dirt in several scenes. The blu ray has none. Watching the remastered BD has finally given me the feeling of seeing the film in it's theatrical presentationAs far as the film itself, I've always loved it. Anyone reading this has probably seen TRON by now so I won't rehash the plot. All I will say about the film is that the story and look were ahead of it's time. Much of the plot and dialogue went over my head when I first saw it. But as technology has progressed and become much more common, TRON became more and more understandable. I'm still amazed that Disney took such a gamble on what was such a radical story. What's even more amazing is that TRON was snubbed by the Academy for ""cheating"" using computers for the visual effects. When you realize what the film makers went through to create the visual effects, you'll demand a Oscar for what they went through. Using computers to do visual effects in 1982 was like drawing a comic book blind folded and having to re-draw panel after panel til you got it right. It wasn't the streamlined process it is today.For any fan of TRON it's a no-brainer that you purchase this blu ray.

This was the first time for me seeing this movie since its original release in the early 80s, and I must say I am immensely impressed with this movie, now 3 decades later. It was then, snd still remains to this day, ahead of its time. Yes, some of the scenes, particularly the ""current"" 80s scenes, are now outdated, but once the movie gets into the ""inside video game"" sequences, I am impressed how well it holds up. Remember, this was done 3 decades ago! But it still feels futuristic. What a great experience to see this movie again after all these years. And to watch it with my son just added to the enjoyment. He was quite impressed by the movie too, even more so that this was made so long ago.Now having seen the original ""Tron"" again after all these years, I can tell you that I like this movie better than ""Tron: Legacy"", which for one thing was way too long, and its story long was way too concocted to make a lot of sense.

The big screen was definitely the way to go.Back in 1982, this movie was THE cutting edge in special effects. Nothing else like it had ever been done before. I beleive that most of the naysayers of this film are of a younger generation that grew up watching movies where CGI effects were the norm rather than revolutionary.Also, the ""computer age"" was just beginning to emerge from the hands of scientists and big corporations and into the hands of the common man. If you were around back then and old enough to understand what was going on, it was an exciting and scary time. No one really knew what was going to happen in our new ""computerized"" society, so there was a bit of apprehension and even a bit of paranoia when it came to these big, bulky machines that people were shelling out thousands of dollars for and setting them up in their living rooms and dens.Tron addresses that apprehension and fear of the future. Of course, computers today are not scary at all and most people give no more thought to using their PC than one would give any extra thought to using a telephone or television. In that respect, Tron may seem dated and silly, but if you remember the computer revolution of the early '80s, Tron was a timely allegory of man's fear of losing control of his life to technology.Ok. Enough of that.This is a great DVD packed with LOADS of special features. I especially appreciated the ""roots"" of Tron and how the characters and ideas developed (as well as the special effects).Give this movie a try if you're into early '80s nostalgia or if you're curious as to what the common man's outlook was like 25 years ago in regards to the future and technology.",4,"Excellent ""old school"" FX film",1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,1734,"['was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Tron', 'theater', 'Wow', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'definitely', 'way', 'go.Back', '1982', 'movie', 'was', 'THE', 'cutting', 'edge', 'special', 'effects', 'Nothing', 'else', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'done', 'beleive', 'most', 'naysayers', 'film', 'are', 'younger', 'generation', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'movies', 'where', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'norm', 'rather', 'revolutionary.Also', 'computer', 'age', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'emerge', 'hands', 'scientists', 'big', 'corporations', 'hands', 'common', 'man', 'were', 'around', 'back', 'then', 'old', 'enough', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'exciting', 'scary', 'time', 'one', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'new', 'computerized', 'society', 'was', 'bit', 'apprehension', 'even', 'bit', 'paranoia', 'when', 'came', 'big', 'bulky', 'machines', 'people', 'were', 'shelling', 'out', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'setting', 'up', 'living', 'rooms', 'dens.Tron', 'addresses', 'apprehension', 'fear', 'future', 'course', 'computers', 'today', 'are', 'not', 'scary', 'most', 'people', 'give', 'more', 'thought', 'using', 'PC', 'one', 'would', 'give', 'extra', 'thought', 'using', 'telephone', 'television', 'respect', 'Tron', 'may', 'seem', 'dated', 'silly', 'remember', 'computer', 'revolution', 'early', ""'80s"", 'Tron', 'was', 'timely', 'allegory', 'man', 'fear', 'losing', 'control', 'life', 'technology.Ok', 'Enough', 'that.This', 'great', 'DVD', 'packed', 'LOADS', 'special', 'features', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'roots', 'Tron', 'how', 'characters', 'ideas', 'developed', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'effects', '.Give', 'movie', 'try', ""'re"", 'early', ""'80s"", 'nostalgia', ""'re"", 'curious', 'what', 'common', 'man', 'outlook', 'was', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'regards', 'future', 'technology']",N/A

Videogames were seen as a niche amusement, and computers were for business. It's lucky for everyone that Disney took a chance on a concept they didn't really understand and greenlit this movie. And who would've thought that the project would attract the likes of artists like Syd Mead and Moebius, and fire the imaginations of artists and programmers everywhere. Look at the opening reveal of the whirling insides of CLU's tank.  It's a stunning synthesis of art, film and sound- it was a new visual language. It paved the way for CGI, and to a lesser degree it also popularized the idea of free networks, at a time when people didn't know what a network was. I feel that the sequel really missed a golden opportunity to make some social commentary about how far we've come since the first film.Tron came out at a time when personal computers and cel-phones were science fiction ideas. Creating a representational world of the inside of a computer was pure greek to the older generation, but us children?  We got it. I saw Tron in the theater when I was 14 and I was overwhelmed by the artistry of it. I don't know if children today could click with it.  Videogames are passe now and graphics are expected to look more real than real life, so I think Tron will best be remembered by those who saw it when it came out and were drawn into it's neon minimalist world.To those fans I will report I am very impressed with this bluray.  The image and sound has been lovingly restored, and that's all. It is, IMO, as beautiful as it's ever going to look and sound.

180428,A1K94LXX833JTT,1558908358,Sanpete,"[1, 1]","Tron is like a dream, where imagery and emotional content are strong but normal rules don't apply, and what rules there are may not have much rational coherence.  And on that level it works.The movie is mostly set inside the computer of the large (fictional) Encom Corporation.  The more being inside the computer is explained, the less sense it makes, so you just have to accept it as fantasy.  Computer programs are conscious, with personalities reflective of their programmers, called Users.  Inside the computer, most programs actually look just like their Users, and behave much as they would.  One program, called the Master Control Program (MCP), is taking over all the other programs in the computer, with an eye to expanding to programs in places like the Pentagon.  The MCP's hunger for conquest is pleased by using unwilling programs as gladiators in computer games where the losers die (are ""derezzed,"" from ""deresolution"").Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) is a program designed to make things open and free in the computer, thereby undoing the dark work of the MCP.Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is a real-world wiz at both playing and writing computer games.  While trying to find the evidence that the MCP's original programmer, who now serves the MCP in the real world, stole some successful game programs from him, he's sucked (to use a technical term) into the computer, where he now looks like and has the same basic state as a program.  Taken prisoner by the MCP and made to play for his life the games he created, he joins with Tron and a female program (yes, programs have gender), to escape the MCP's control and restore goodness and light.There's a quasi-spiritual side to all of this.  It comes out in a not entirely serious way in treating the belief among programs in Users as a religious belief.  The MCP is trying to eliminate that belief, but programs naturally wonder where they came from.  When Tron learns that Flynn is a User, he says one of the film's funnier lines, ""If you are a User, then everything you've done has been according to a plan, right?""  There are sideways glances at other real-world issues too, such as a struggle of decentralized computing (as in personal computers, still new at the time) vs central computing (mainframes), and corporate corruption of idealism and creativity.  The latter qualities are embodied in the character Walter, who started Encom in his garage (just as Walt Disney started his enterprise in his--what parallel does that suggest?).The fantasy of escaping from an oppressive system and passing through trials, with some romance thrown in, is basic and universal, the stuff of dreams.  Inside the computer, the story unfolds like a dream, aided by the otherworldly special effects.  The backgrounds are mainly dark.  A lot of the animation is the addition of light, as though programs and their surroundings glow from within via what are designed to look like electronic circuits.  The terrain (as it were) includes both vast spaces and tight passages through which various vehicles move in breakneck, menacing, or graceful ways.  Sometimes it feels like what we might imagine it to be like to be in a video game (from the early 80s), sometimes it's more like being in an airplane over a city at night.  It was impressive on the big screen, and still packs some punch for home viewing.The effects in Tron are unique, based on a hybrid of early computer animation and highly labor-intensive manual animation.  They were groundbreaking at the time.  The filmmakers remark in the special features that no film will ever be done the same way again, which is probably true as to process.Even so, Tron 2 is coming out this year and the trailer does have a distinctive Tron look, if much advanced (google Tron Legacy to see it and get more info).The musical score, by Wendy Carlos, makes more sense if you recall what video game music sounded like in the early 1980s.The major special features in this DVD set are the audio commentary with the writer/director and several of the main effects makers, and an 88-minute making-of feature (with no chapters--poor execution there).  It's best to watch the making-of feature before you listen to the commentary, so you'll have a better idea what they're talking about when the commentary turns technical, which it does a lot.  There are also some deleted scenes, some substantial.  The other features on the second disc often overlap with parts of the making-of, but there's some interesting stuff in some of them, mainly for those wanting more details about how the project developed.  (The Kodaliths they keep talking about but never fully explain are the 12.5"" x 20"" celluloid transparencies used in the animation process, one for each animated frame of film--that's a lot of Kodaliths.)By the way, if the idea of being inside a computer game is of interest, there's a serious philosophical argument that this universe is a simulation, that we're virtual creatures ourselves.  Google Bostrom simulation for details.  I think it's an interesting and significant argument.This would be at most a 4-star movie in most respects, but the pioneering effects make it 5 for me.",5,"Doesn't make much sense, but effects are

180442,A26MJME9IBNETY,1558908358,StrangePegs,"[1, 1]","Greetings, Programs...It doesn't always take great writing to make a great film. Of course, I'm sure there are many out there that would argue that Tron is not a great film. I don't feel like debating the definition of greatness, at the moment, though, so I'm just going to say that based upon it's cultural impact and cult status, it's a great film. After all, how many movies get an actual sequel after almost 30 years. Not a re-boot. Not a re-make. An honest to goodness sequel. It's almost a singular achievement (it may be a singular achievement, for all I know).Tron is the movie that opened the door to computer generated special effects. In fact, John Lasseter has said that without Tron there would have been no Toy Story as it was Tron that opened his eyes to the potential of computer animation. Despite that, Tron contains far less computer generated material than most people might suspect, but what was there was completely new, much of which was never used again due to the costs involved. Interestingly enough, Tron was not even nominated for a special effects Oscar possibly because of the use of computers, which was considered ""cheating"" by many in the Academy, at the time.The story of Tron is fairly straightforward and ironically appropriate for Disney. The conflict revolves around a corporation (Encom) taking advantage of the little guy (Kevin Flynn) by stealing his work and the little guy trying to prove the work is actually his. Even at 12, when the movie came out, I knew that the story was just the vehicle to get Flynn into the ""digital"" world of the computer so they could show off their stuff. Still, it's a solid plot even if it's not original. We still seem to be having issues with that aspect of corporate greed in America, so I can't say it's not a story that needs to be told anymore. They may have done better to have centered Tron: Legacy on that same type of story since it opens with those same overtones, but Disney isn't brave enough to do that story again, or, perhaps, realizes it's a message that strikes at the heart of their business model, so they abandon it as soon as the younger Flynn enters The Grid.There is, however, one bit of story genius that I was struck with at the time, and it has always stayed with me. This one thing made the movie for me, made it great in my mind, as it completely fascinated me at 12. I thought it was SO cool, and, yet, most people miss it entirely (along with the significance of it within the confines of the story), and some have even argued that it didn't happen that way at all. The key to the weight of the story of Tron is getting Flynn into the digital world himself. Flynn is our connection, the eyes that allow us to see this digital world as real. But they have to get him inside the computer. Utilizing another emerging technology (lasers), they have him zapped by a laser that is being developed as a quantum teleportation device. Early in the movie, we get to witness this laser being tested on an orange. The process only takes a few seconds. Zap target with laser. Digitize target. Reintegrate target. The implication, then, is that Flynn's sojourn in the digital world happens within this span of a few seconds.  [They support this idea in the sequel by quantifying the time discrepancy, although I'm not remembering the ratio, right off the top of my head.] It was a fabulous notion.Still, it took time for Tron to really grow on me. And repeated exposure to the video games. There was, of course, the Tron arcade game, which made more money than the movie. We owned it for our Atari. Although I liked the game, it was never one of my favorites. However, Discs of Tron... that one, I loved. It was more than just a joystick game. None of my friends liked it because it was ""too hard,"" and, indeed, it was one of the most complex games around. For years. But I loved it. Except for one thing, it wasn't just a quarter to play it. I don't remember what the actual cost was, but I remember being constantly put off by the fact that it cost so much. However, when I was in college, they put a Discs of Tron in the student center (at the one quarter/play cost) during my freshman year, and I ruled that game. Literally. Not only did I have the high score, but no one could beat me at head-to-head play, either. I was extremely sad when they removed the game at the beginning of my sophomore year. For that game alone, Tron holds a special place of nostalgia in my heart.And, then, there's Jeff Bridges. Between Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill, Bridges had a lot of competition back when I was 12, but I noticed him, which is saying a lot. I noticed him more with Starman in 1984, but it was Tucker: The Man and His Dream that really convinced me of how great an actor he is. I spent my 20s telling people that he was the most underrated actor in Hollywood, and I wasn't wrong. It's great that he's now getting the recognition that he's deserved for so long. The fact that he has been so instrumental in the return of Tron says a lot both for whom he is and the film. The legacy of Tron.My boys were immediately excited when they heard there was going to be a sequel (to the original), and the initial trailers for it sent them both into a frenzy of excitement over it. It's hard to fault them for that. The trailers were nearly as visually stunning as the movie. And it was. Visually stunning. The film is worth seeing just as a visual masterpiece, and it was... well, it was spectacular in 3D. It's true that the plot is a bit more contrived and, therefore, weaker than the plot for the original, but, again, the story is really only there as a vehicle to display the digital landscape they've created. I will say, though, that it's only upon reflection that the holes in the story become apparent. Bridges' talent is enough to make everything believable, and Garrett Hedlund, who plays Flynn's son, is more than adequate in supporting him. Truthfully, the film is dazzling enough just on its own that it's hard to contemplate any weaknesses while watching it. At least on  the big screen.end of line",5,Combined review for Tron and Legacy,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,6099,"['Greetings', 'Programs', ""n't"", 'always', 'take', 'great', 'writing', 'make',

The music score was done by the rock group ""Journey"" adding a lifting spiritual ambiance to the great costuming and early computer graphics. The premise of this story follows revelations found in Hindu, Buddhist and Christian teachings. The concept deals with the Universe existing inside the God of the Creation who is both Creator and creation.This Universe within a Universe is made only all to clear as you enter the world of Kevin Flynn, played by Jeff Bridges. Kevin, who should be key executive of the company he works for, had his greatest electronic games stolen by one of the company's partners, played by David Warner. Kevin must find the evidence inside the computer, if he is to redeem his true status in life. However, he takes a bad turn one night with the MCP who transports him into the world Kevin Flynn helped create, as the MCP turns Kevin, a human, into a computer program.In the end, Kevin plays a Messiah type figure, who takes on the MCP by sacrificing himself to the MCP to free the system from its evil and make the system a free system in the end. How he reaches his destiny, which also returns him to the real world with the evidence he needs to regain his throne in the corporation, makes for great fun and entertainment as the story unfolds.Since he has ""Christ like"" powers as a ""user"" or ""creator"" of the system, while in the system; he is even able to ""raise the dead"" when it comes to one program in particular he falls in love with. He's also able to do things, we only dream about in the real world, in his new environment. It's a cute film to watch and very uplifting once you see the premise it was written from.

After all this is a film Roger Ebert gave four stars (out of four).But let's face it. Some people say the visuals of ""Tron"" look dated. Of course they are because it was made about 30 years ago. The real problem of the film is not that part, however. It is the pace of the film that really damages the otherwise excellent film. Director Steven Lisberger's storytelling lacks momentum and clarity especially toward the climax that could have been more exciting.There is not enough interaction between characters including the hero of justice ""Tron"" (actually a computer program) played by Bruce Boxleitner, and ""Yori"" by Cindy Morgan. David Warner playing multiple roles is effective, but his ""villain(s)"" isn't as strong a menace as he should. We need a Darth Vader or Grand Moff Tarkin at least.Of more interest to me is Jeff Bridges, who plays Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer (called a ""user"" here) trapped in the world of computer.

No one would have ever expected that these wondrous thinking machines would be a staple of the common house hold let alone be used for anything else than simple game programs. Suddenly in the early 1980s a film was announced and it was to be the first that ever delved into the concept that computers could be use to help make films through its own style of animation. That movie was Tron.Tron is a simple story starring the great Jeff Bridges who hacks his way into his old company's computer data base to retrieve evidence that ideas for successful computer games belonged him and not the man who forced him to leave. Little did he know that a program known as Master Control had been growing and hacking its own way into other databases to become the greatest most powerful program ever. Machines thinking on their own?! ,Who would have thought?! So the computer universe is given a visit from ""The Dude"" and a cult hit is born.This film for what it was for its time in incredible. I am blown away by what creative minds felt would be the next generation of film making. Mind you if you were born after 1996 you probably will not understand this film nor will you even believe that there was a time when computers that you see in Tron were considered `Advanced.' This film is not only a great ride, but it is a historical trip in understanding the pioneering of computer technology and how we got to where we are today. The plot is a little hard to get at times and the movie does move a bit slow. Still, Tron is a classic and a true wonder to behold",4,A breakthrough classic.,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,1675,"['can', 'try', 'believe', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'computers', 'considered', 'untouchable', 'average', 'person', 'world', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'expected', 'wondrous', 'thinking', 'machines', 'would', 'be', 'staple', 'common', 'house', 'hold', 'let', 'alone', 'be', 'used', 'anything', 'else', 'simple', 'game', 'programs', 'Suddenly', 'early', '1980s', 'film', 'was', 'announced', 'was', 'be', 'first', 'ever', 'delved', 'concept', 'computers', 'could', 'be', 'use', 'help', 'make', 'films', 'own', 'style', 'animation', 'movie', 'was', 'Tron.Tron', 'simple', 'story', 'starring', 'great', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'way', 'old', 'company', 'computer', 'data', 'base', 'retrieve', 'evidence', 'ideas', 'successful', 'computer', 'games', 'belonged', 'not', 'man', 'who', 'forced', 'leave', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'program', 'known', 'Master', 'Control', 'had', 'been', 'growing', 'hacking', 'own', 'way', 'other', 'databases', 'become', 'greatest', 'most', 'powerful', 'program', 'ever', 'Machines', 'thinking', 'own', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'computer', 'universe', 'given', 'visit', 'Dude', 'cult', 'hit', 'born.This', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'time', 'incredible', 'am', 'blown', 'away', 'what', 'creative', 'minds', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'generation', 'film', 'making', 'Mind', 'were', 'born', '1996', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'film', 'will', 'even', 'believe', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'computers', 'see', 'Tron', 'were', 'considered', 'Advanced', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'ride', 'historical', 'trip', 'understanding', 'pioneering', 'computer', 'technology', 'how', 'got', 'where', 'are', 'today', 'plot', 'little', 'hard', 'get', 'times', 'movie', 'move', 'bit', 'slow', 'Still', 'Tron', 'classic', 'true', 'wonder', 'behold']",N/A

180462,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,1558908358,Westley,"[23, 62]","TRON stars Jeff Bridges as the brilliant computer programmer Flynn.  He's fired from his company for some reason (here's part of why it's so convoluted) and attempts to hack into the company's computer to prove that he wrote some programs stolen by the senior exec, Dillinger.  He enlists the help of several company employees, one of whom has written a hacker program called Tron.  While using the program, Flynn gets sucked into cyberspace and has to disarm the Master Control Program (MCP), which was developed by Dillinger.  Whew!  The plot is way more complex than need be.When released by Disney in 1982, TRON was a bit of a flop.  Expected to be a huge hit, it only placed at #18 for the year, behind such 80s relics as ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""First Blood,"" and ""The Dark Crystal.""  This lack of success likely lead to the subsequent dearth of videogames-based movies, potentially sparing us ""From Pac-Man to Ms. Pac-Man.""Despite the lame plot, TRON is good kitschy 80s fun.  The special effects (for 1982) are extremely impressive, and several sequences remain exciting.  In particular, the scenes where the MCP forces the computer programs to battle each other as cyber-motorcycles are quite fun.  Compared to more recent movies based on videogames (e.g., Final Fantasy, Laura Croft movies), TRON is surprisingly tame and gentle, which only adds to its appeal.  This movie may bore many young videogame fans, but it will be enjoyed by fans of 80s movies and videogames.",3,"Lame & convoluted, but kinda fun!",1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,1478,"['TRON', 'stars', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'brilliant', 'computer', 'programmer', 'Flynn', 'fired', 'company', 'reason', 'here', 'part', 'why', 'so', 'convoluted', 'attempts', 'hack', 'company', 'computer', 'prove', 'wrote', 'programs', 'stolen', 'senior', 'exec', 'Dillinger', 'help', 'several', 'company', 'employees', 'one', 'whom', 'written', 'hacker', 'program', 'called', 'Tron', 'using', 'program', 'Flynn', 'sucked', 'cyberspace', 'disarm', 'Master', 'Control', 'Program', 'MCP', 'was', 'developed', 'Dillinger', 'Whew', 'plot', 'way', 'more', 'complex', 'need', 'be.When', 'released', 'Disney', '1982', 'TRON', 'was', 'bit', 'flop', 'Expected', 'be', 'huge', 'hit', 'only', 'placed', '18', 'year', 'such', '80s', 'relics', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'First', 'Blood', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'lack', 'success', 'likely', 'lead', 'subsequent', 'dearth', 'videogames-based', 'movies', 'potentially', 'sparing', 'Pac-Man', 'Ms', 'Pac-Man', 'lame', 'plot', 'TRON', 'good', 'kitschy', '80s', 'fun', 'special', 'effects', '1982', 'are', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'several', 'sequences', 'remain', 'exciting', 'particular', 'scenes', 'where', 'MCP', 'computer', 'programs', 'battle', 'other', 'cyber-motorcycles', 'are', 'quite', 'fun', 'Compared', 'more', 'recent', 'movies', 'based', 'videogames', 'e.g.', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Laura', 'Croft', 'movies', 'TRON', 'surprisingly', 'tame', 'gentle', 'only', 'appeal', 'movie', 'may', 'bore', 'many', 'young', 'videogame', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'fans', '80s', 'movies', 'videogames']",N/A

180465,A3OI841P5R6FCH,1558908358,Zagnorch,"[1, 2]","Well, I hate to admit it, but it finally happened. I thought I was vigilant enough to prevent it from ever happening to me, but now I'm yet another victim. A victim of what, you ask? A victim of a movie studio's DVD double-dip sales strategy, that's what! I'm sure most of you digital videophiles are familiar with the scene: one of your fave flicks comes out on DVD with minimal extra features, and you buy it, never suspecting that the studio and/or distributor might put out a deluxe, mega-tricked-out collector's edition DVD of the same beloved movie sometime down the road. But sure enough, several months to a few years later, that's exactly what happens. Fortunately, I learned of Disney's double-dip tactic with TRON about four months before the 20th Anniversary edition's street date, so I was able to auction off my old platter of it on eBay before word-of-mouth (and of e-mail) spread about the new release. Fortunately, I recouped almost all of what I originally paid for it. If I'd put it on the block any later, I likely wouldn't've gotten as much for it, and... hey wait a minute, I'm going off on a tangent here. I'm giving you advice for selling your DVDs on eBay when I should be presenting my review of the item at hand. Sorry `bout that. I'm gonna get back on track here with my critiques of this particular DVD edition's special features, starting.......right now. I think I'm getting a bit jaded with the bonus materials included with these special-edition DVDs. There was a time when I'd be almost ecstatic over the extra thingies that I'd be able to look at and enjoy long after the closing credits of the movie itself were rolling. But nowadays, it just doesn't seem as big a deal anymore. It's probably because just about every Collector's version movie platter contains pretty much the same things: one or more behind-the-scenes documentaries and/or featurettes, stills of the movie in production as well as various merchandise & promotional items, deleted/altered scenes, storyboard sketches, and of course the obligatory trailers and teasers. All of which can be found in this particular presentation, as well as a few other bits & pieces Disney picked up off the cutting-room floor. Oh yes, and let's not forget......the feature-length commentary track. TRON'S secondary audio channel is helmed by co-writer/director Stephen Lisberger and a few other TRON collaborators. Often they'll go over the making of each corresponding scene, as well as the movie's history of production. Throw in a few cute little anecdotes, and you pretty much have your basic informative commentary track. A few of the things the speakers mention here are also discussed in the behind-the-scenes documentary, so you might already be familiar with some of the things they're commenting on if you watched the doc beforehand.Unfortunately, I have to concur with a few of my fellow Amazonians about the TRON 20th Anniversary DVD's picture quality. The movie isn't quite as crisp & clear as the preceding bare-bones edition disc. I found the sound quality & separation to be as good, though. I really enjoy hearing the subtle background sounds that I never even noticed until I saw it on DVD. A great example of this are the famous Pac-Man video game sound effects that one can hear during the scenes on the bridge of Sark's giant CGI carrier/cruiser thingy.Well, I guess it's time for me to wind this up. If you already own this flick, I'm going to leave you with a little ""Where's Waldo?""-type task: look for Mickey Mouse's head, which is drawn somewhere on the landscape of the CGI realm in the last half of the movie. Oh, and no fair listening to the commentary track (Lisberger & friends point it out)!`Late",3,Another example of the dreaded DVD double-dip ploy,1012089600,"01 27, 2002",2002,3714,"['Well', 'hate', 'admit', 'finally', 'happened', 'thought', 'was', 'vigilant', 'enough', 'prevent', 'ever', 'happening', 'now', ""'m"", 'yet', 'victim', 'victim', 'what', 'ask', 'victim', 'movie', 'studio', 'DVD', 'double-dip', 'sales', 'strategy', 'what', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'digital', 'videophiles', 'are', 'familiar', 'scene', 'one', 'fave', 'flicks', 'out', 'DVD', 'minimal', 'extra', 'features', 'buy', 'never', 'suspecting', 'studio', 'and/or', 'distributor', 'might', 'put', 'out', 'deluxe', 'mega-tricked-out', 'collector', 'edition', 'DVD', 'same', 'beloved', 'movie', 'sometime', 'down', 'road', 'sure', 'enough', 'several', 'months', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'exactly', 'what', 'Fortunately', 'learned', 'Disney', 'double-dip', 'tactic', 'TRON', 'four', 'months', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'edition', 'street', 'date', 'was', 'able', 'auction', 'off', 'old', 'platter', 'eBay', 'word-of-mouth', 'e-mail', 'spread', 'new', 'release', 'Fortunately', 'recouped', 'almost', 'what', 'originally', 'paid', ""'d"", 'put', 'block', 'later', 'likely', ""wouldn't"", ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'much', 'hey', 'wait', 'minute', ""'m"", 'going', 'off', 'tangent', 'here', ""'m"", 'giving', 'advice', 'selling', 'DVDs', 'eBay', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'presenting', 'review', 'item', 'hand', 'Sorry', 'bout', ""'m"", 'gon', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'here', 'critiques', 'particular', 'DVD', 'edition', 'special', 'features', 'starting', '.right', 'now', 'think', ""'m"", 'getting', 'bit', 'jaded', 'bonus', 'materials', 'included', 'special-edition', 'DVDs', 'was', 'time', 'when', ""'d"", 'be', 'almost', 'ecstatic', 'extra', 'thingies', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'look', 'enjoy', 'long', 'closing', 'credits', 'movie', 'were', 'rolling', 'nowadays', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'big', 'deal', 'anymore', 'probably', 'just', 'Collector', 'version', 'movie', 'platter', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'things', 'one', 'more', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentaries', 'and/or', 'featurettes', 'stills', 'movie', 'production', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'merchandise', 'promotional', 'items', 'deleted/altered', 'scenes', 'storyboard', 'sketches', 'course', 'obligatory', 'trailers', 'teasers', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'particular', 'presentation', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'other', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Disney', 'picked', 'up', 'cutting-room', 'floor', 'Oh', 'yes', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'feature-length', 'commentary', 'track', 'TRON', 'secondary', 'audio', 'channel', 'helmed', 'co-writer/director', 'Stephen', 'Lisberger', 'few', 'other', 'TRON', 'collaborators', 'Often', ""'ll"", 'go', 'making', 'corresponding', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'history', 'production', 'Throw', 'few', 'cute', 'little', 'anecdotes', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'basic', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'few', 'things', 'speakers', 'mention', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'discussed', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'might', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'things', ""'re"", 'commenting', 'watched', 'doc', 'beforehand.Unfortunately', 'have', 'concur', 'few', 'fellow', 'Amazonians', 'TRON', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'crisp', 'clear', 'preceding', 'bare-bones', 'edition', 'disc', 'found', 'sound', 'quality', 'separation', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'really', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'subtle', 'background', 'never', 'even', 'noticed', 'saw', 'DVD', 'A', 'great', 'example', 'are', 'famous', 'Pac-Man', 'video', 'game', 'sound', 'effects', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'scenes', 'bridge', 'Sark', 'giant', 'CGI', 'carrier/cruiser', 'thingy.Well', 'guess', 'time', 'wind', 'up', 'already', 'own', 'flick', ""'m"", 'going', 'leave', 'little', 'Where', 'Waldo', '-type', 'task', 'look', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'head', 'drawn', 'somewhere', 'landscape', 'CGI', 'realm', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'Oh', 'fair', 'listening', 'commentary', 'track', 'Lisberger', 'friends', 'point', 'out', 'Late']",N/A
