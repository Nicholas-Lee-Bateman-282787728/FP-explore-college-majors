We meet his defense team, we meet his family, we meet his friends.  We meet the defense in what is more of a fleeting introduction because they weren't as comfortable talking about their strategies and such as the defense.  What you get overall is a sense of the inner workings in a real case, the humans at stake and the people who're in charge of their destinies.  As the reviewer who spoke before of a number of the evidences not being shown in this series, I'm convinced it was because the prosecution didn't want to allow the filmmakers the opportunity get that in fear that they would use it to help the defense and so they couldn't connect it to other scenes where it was presented in court.  At any rate, what is presented does show a strong argument that Peterson didn't do it, and even the evidence that was used to convince the jury of his guilt doesn't fly when compared to the things that the prosecution uses to create motive and ""potential"" murder weapon.  In many ways the prosecution is revealed in the series as being a story of the Emperor having no clothes.  Their case is built on guess work, and not facts.  Those other facts of her death that led to the verdict don't take away from the fact that the prosecution couldn't explain the inconsistencies between her injuries and the injuries that had happened because of murder from a weapon.  Whereas, the prosecutions guess work is sketchy at best and not backed up well at all, the defense hires specialists to prove that their alternative theories (since they can't know exactly how she died, they weren't there) were highly possible. Unfortunately, the jury didn't connect with this information and instead went with the prosecutions last ditch efforts to present fragments that don't add up to his murdering her. That's not presented in this series, but what you get is the fact that truth and facts are not things are not things that necessarily add up to justice being served. Often, the American justice system is about having the resources to win, which shouldn't be anything new to the public.  This is a rare case when the defendant did have the resources and he still lost.  Now, if only in the future we could have a documentary film with footage of a jury deliberating that would be insightful. All of the special features in this collection are nice appendices of the series, and it's understandable why they are included and why the deleted scenes were cut out of the film.  As you might have caught from this review, the series is very engaging and if the American justice system interests you, check it out.

In fact, I couldn't tell--at first--if this film was truly a documentary or one played by actors.  In the end, I was pleasantly surprised by the superlative true-to-life drama and mounting suspense coupled with an extended treatment of the family and the lawyer-client relationship. The only downside from a viewing perspective was the inclusion of extensive forensic evidence which I found to be too technical and hard to follow.  Hence, I'm glad I wasn't on that jury.

There is such an enormous amount of doubt about the case, about the guilt and even about the murder itself that it is unbelievable that a unanimous verdict of guilt came out of the jury pool. Such cases are examples for us to question the system of justice we set up over the last four centuries. And the judge decided to impose life imprisonment but for first degree murder it could have been the death penalty. It is such cases that prove that jury justice is maybe good in many cases but there are a few cases where it is the worst possible system, and that is why the death penalty should be gotten rid of, and that's why we should make sure the defendants, now sentenced culprits, have access to all possibilities and opportunities to appeal the decision and to have the best councilors available. Jury justice in a world that is so deeply cut in small antagonistic pieces does not work in any sensitive delicate case because of any kind of un-namable bias having to do with race, wealth, age, sex, sexual orientation, and any other parameter you may think of. This case should be compared to other cases where the reverse decision was reached, but the model of such a case of failed justice was clearly written in a book and set to the screen a long time ago: ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"". Miscarriage of justice due to some kind of totally unmentionable prejudice. I am not sure though that the conclusion of ""Romeo and Juliet"" is the proper one here: ""They are all Punished"", because in Romeo and Juliet's case there was no trial, and especially no jury trial.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Jury justice is not always a guarantee of fair justice,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,1950,"['film', 'murder', 'case', 'trial', 'one', 'American', 'films', 'fact', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'real', 'case', 'not', 'go', 'normal', 'direction', 'direction', 'what', 'should', 'think', 'not', 'truth', 'justice', 'should', 'be', 'such', 'enormous', 'amount', 'doubt', 'case', 'guilt', 'even', 'murder', 'unbelievable', 'unanimous', 'verdict', 'guilt', 'came', 'jury', 'pool', 'Such', 'cases', 'are', 'examples', 'question', 'system', 'justice', 'set', 'up', 'last', 'four', 'centuries', 'judge', 'decided', 'impose', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'first', 'degree', 'murder', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'death', 'penalty', 'such', 'cases', 'prove', 'jury', 'justice', 'maybe', 'good', 'many', 'cases', 'are', 'few', 'cases', 'where', 'worst', 'possible', 'system', 'why', 'death', 'penalty', 'should', 'be', 'gotten', 'rid', 'why', 'should', 'make', 'sure', 'defendants', 'now', 'sentenced', 'culprits', 'have', 'access', 'possibilities', 'opportunities', 'appeal', 'decision', 'have', 'best', 'councilors', 'available', 'Jury', 'justice', 'world', 'so', 'deeply', 'cut', 'small', 'antagonistic', 'pieces', 'not', 'work', 'sensitive', 'delicate', 'case', 'kind', 'un-namable', 'bias', 'having', 'do', 'race', 'wealth', 'age', 'sex', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'other', 'parameter', 'may', 'think', 'case', 'should', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'cases', 'where', 'reverse', 'decision', 'was', 'reached', 'model', 'such', 'case', 'failed', 'justice', 'was', 'clearly', 'written', 'book', 'set', 'screen', 'long', 'time', 'Kill', 'Mocking', 'Bird', 'Miscarriage', 'justice', 'due', 'kind', 'totally', 'unmentionable', 'prejudice', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'conclusion', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'proper', 'one', 'here', 'are', 'Punished', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'case', 'was', 'trial', 'especially', 'jury', 'trial.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

Vance has spent a great deal of time researching the entire trial, the victims, and Mr. Peterson himself and clearly points out all the discrepancies in this DVD.If you visit his Website first, you will be all the more drawn to purchasing this 8-chapter set.  Just to KNOW this Peterson guy is GUILTY beyound a resonable doubt, then to watch him snake his way through the trial with his mock tears, and his innapropriate humour at times makes you realize this guy is the most self-centered, narcissistic sociopath that ever walked the streets of Durham, North Carolina.Not only did he murder his second wife, Kathleen, but it seems pretty obvious he may have murdered his first wife's best friend in Germany when she too was found bloody, and at the bottom of a long staircase.  Top this all off with the fact that Michael is Bi-Sexual and had been carrying on multiple affairs with both women and MEN during BOTH his marraiges, and you will walk away thoroughly convinced he belongs in that Prison they interview him in on the last disc's ""Special Features"" addition vinnette.Still playing the pitiful role as the persecuted victim, this incredibly insensitve egotist is lucky he didn't meet ""Old Sparky"" instead of getting off with a life sentence with no parole.This documentary is a must see for true crime buffs, and a fascinating study in how Peterson's own family and friends can be so blindly decieved by a master Sociopath who cares nothing about anyone but himself.  Jean Xavier de Lestrade, ""The Staircase"" Director should throw his Oscar for ""Murder on a Sunday Afternoon"" into the Seine River for presenting Peterson as the ""innocent victim of a prejudiced court and community"" and go back to making commercials in Paris for French Laundries and skinny brown Turkish cigarettes.Although Lestrade simply closes his featurette interviews on this DVD with comments like ""we just don't know what happened,"" the REST of us are pretty convinced Peterson should have got the ""Chair"" for murdering not one, but TWO women for who knows what reason but his own.  Sociopaths don't always need a reason to kill someone......just a convenient dimly lit Staircase and a trusting soul as his next victim standing before him on those steps.",5,"If Michael Peterson isn't guilty, then I'm not a Bay Area Boy!",1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,2533,"['purchased', 'DVD', '7', 'months', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'eight', 'episodes', 'least', 'ten', 'time', 'had', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'convinced', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'was', 'guilty', 'even', 'found', 'great', 'Website', 'internet', 'called', '[', ']', 'hosted', 'fella', 'named', 'Vance', 'Holmes', 'Vance', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'researching', 'entire', 'trial', 'victims', 'Mr.', 'Peterson', 'clearly', 'points', 'out', 'discrepancies', 'DVD.If', 'visit', 'Website', 'first', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'drawn', 'purchasing', '8-chapter', 'set', 'Just', 'KNOW', 'Peterson', 'guy', 'GUILTY', 'resonable', 'doubt', 'then', 'watch', 'snake', 'way', 'trial', 'mock', 'tears', 'innapropriate', 'humour', 'times', 'realize', 'guy', 'most', 'self-centered', 'narcissistic', 'sociopath', 'ever', 'walked', 'streets', 'Durham', 'North', 'Carolina.Not', 'only', 'did', 'murder', 'second', 'wife', 'Kathleen', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'may', 'have', 'murdered', 'first', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'Germany', 'when', 'too', 'was', 'found', 'bloody', 'bottom', 'long', 'staircase', 'Top', 'fact', 'Michael', 'Bi-Sexual', 'had', 'been', 'carrying', 'multiple', 'affairs', 'women', 'MEN', 'BOTH', 'marraiges', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'thoroughly', 'convinced', 'Prison', 'interview', 'last', 'disc', 'Special', 'Features', 'addition', 'playing', 'pitiful', 'role', 'persecuted', 'victim', 'incredibly', 'insensitve', 'egotist', 'lucky', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'Old', 'Sparky', 'instead', 'getting', 'off', 'life', 'sentence', 'parole.This', 'documentary', 'must', 'see', 'true', 'crime', 'buffs', 'fascinating', 'study', 'how', 'Peterson', 'own', 'family', 'friends', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'blindly', 'decieved', 'master', 'Sociopath', 'who', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'Jean', 'Xavier', 'de', 'Lestrade', 'Staircase', 'Director', 'should', 'throw', 'Oscar', 'Murder', 'Sunday', 'Afternoon', 'Seine', 'River', 'presenting', 'Peterson', 'innocent', 'victim', 'prejudiced', 'court', 'community', 'go', 'back', 'making', 'commercials', 'Paris', 'French', 'Laundries', 'skinny', 'brown', 'Turkish', 'cigarettes.Although', 'Lestrade', 'simply', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'comments', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'REST', 'are', 'pretty', 'convinced', 'Peterson', 'should', 'have', 'got', 'Chair', 'murdering', 'not', 'one', 'TWO', 'women', 'who', 'what', 'reason', 'own', 'Sociopaths', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'need', 'reason', 'kill', 'someone', 'just', 'convenient', 'dimly', 'lit', 'Staircase', 'trusting', 'soul', 'next', 'victim', 'standing', 'steps']",N/A
918465,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,B000A1INIK,Jessica Lux,"[9, 16]","Documentary filmmaker Jean-Xavier de Lestrade set out to portray both sides of the sensational 2001 case in which author Michael Peterson was arraigned for the murder of his wife Kathleen, whose body was discovered lying in a poll of blood on the stairway of their home.  As the case progressed, the prosecution became less willing to speak to the filmmakers, so the story transitioned into that of the defense team.One could write a term paper or a book about the intricacies of this case, the twists and turns on both sides, so there's no need to recount any of them in the review.  This eight-part series painstakingly lays out the details for the audience to make their own determination about the case.  I went away amazed at what it costs to mount a proper defense in America.  Peterson tallied his expected costs at $800,000, and he boggled how any working-class American could defend themselves.The documentary drives home the fact that trials are not about right and wrong.  They are a personal battle between the prosecution and the defense.  So much depends on juror perception, not on the actual fact of testimony.  Once the prosecution marries themselves to a story, they stick to it no matter what holes are poked in it, because they can't lose face.This is a worthwhile film, and the directory and producer commentaries will help bring some sense of perspective once you've been blown away by the series.",5,A fascinating (and terrifying) look inside American justice,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,1419,"['Documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Jean-Xavier', 'Lestrade', 'set', 'out', 'portray', 'sides', 'sensational', '2001', 'case', 'author', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'was', 'arraigned', 'murder', 'wife', 'Kathleen', 'body', 'was', 'discovered', 'lying', 'poll', 'blood', 'stairway', 'home', 'case', 'progressed', 'prosecution', 'became', 'less', 'willing', 'speak', 'filmmakers', 'story', 'transitioned', 'defense', 'team.One', 'could', 'write', 'term', 'paper', 'book', 'intricacies', 'case', 'twists', 'turns', 'sides', 'need', 'recount', 'review', 'eight-part', 'series', 'painstakingly', 'out', 'details', 'audience', 'make', 'own', 'determination', 'case', 'went', 'away', 'amazed', 'what', 'mount', 'proper', 'defense', 'America', 'Peterson', 'tallied', 'expected', 'costs', '800,000', 'boggled', 'how', 'working-class', 'American', 'could', 'defend', 'themselves.The', 'documentary', 'drives', 'home', 'fact', 'trials', 'are', 'not', 'about', 'right', 'wrong', 'are', 'personal', 'battle', 'prosecution', 'defense', 'So', 'much', 'depends', 'juror', 'perception', 'not', 'actual', 'fact', 'testimony', 'prosecution', 'story', 'stick', 'matter', 'what', 'are', 'poked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', 'face.This', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'directory', 'producer', 'commentaries', 'will', 'help', 'bring', 'sense', 'perspective', ""'ve"", 'been', 'blown', 'away', 'series']",N/A

918467,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000A1INIK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","When Jean-Xavier de Lestrade's comprehensive, problematic, and strangely exhilarating documentary miniseries ""The Staircase"" premiered on the Sundance Channel in 2004, I sat transfixed for all eight episodes. It is certainly a program that has stayed with me through the years, and I even survived the 2007 Lifetime network obligatory ripped-from-the-headlines interpretation ""The Staircase Murders."" Having been unavailable on DVD for some time, I'm glad to see it being reissued as this is surely one of the more fascinating examples of documentary filmmaking that you're likely to encounter. Lestrade, an Oscar winner for ""Murder on a Sunday Morning,"" took on the 2001 highly publicized murder trial of author Michael Peterson to unravel the follies and foibles of the legal system. I saw an interview with Lestrade in which he claimed that once he met the larger-than-life Peterson, the direction the documentary would take started to formulate itself. And that's easy to believe, Peterson is a character you can't tear your eyes away from.I have heard ""The Staircase"" decried as both a masterpiece and as irresponsible trash. It tends to elicit a very strong reaction as the piece itself, and Lestrade's point of view, seem pretty well substantiated. Does he feel Peterson was innocent of orchestrating the murder of his wife? It certainly seems that he does. And yet despite this obvious slant, the film itself won't necessarily make you a believer. Further research into actual events, should you be interested, also lead one to see that certain principle evidence vital to convicting Peterson gets little play in the documentary. But I don't think establishing guilt or innocence has anything to do with the brilliance of ""The Staircase."" Perhaps that's a controversial position, but the truths it does document are almost as frightening as any murder investigation. The movie allows its cast to create their own portraits, and this character study is as compelling and riveting as any fictional drama.Peterson is a chilling and complicated persona whose very demeanor might make one leery. Others in the Peterson family are oddly vacant, others poised for vengeance. As presented, the prosecution's case becomes so extravagant and improbable--it's hard not to imagine a reasonable doubt acquittal. They so single-mindedly pile every strategy into the mix (a previous murder, fictional writing, sexuality, and other oddball theories). To watch the defense formulate plans about how they wish to build a rebuttal is never less than fascinating. But most interesting is how everything is just a construction, defense and prosecution. The truth seemingly is the least of anyone's concern when building a case. What's real? What's relevant? And does it matter?This is, after all, the justice system at work. In this case, the trial was overcome by prejudices and pre-conceived notions. Guilt or innocence? I know what I believe after having researched this case in various venues. But, in the long run, Lestrade's film does more than just document a trial.

We had no idea what the verdict would be and was surprised by all the drama. Excellent direction and camera/sound work. I really like the interviews with the lawyers and the accused and the family. This is a rare look into a person's life during a murder trial. Surprises around every corner. This is not a court tv type of show. It is an amazing documentary and should be watched/studied in school. They made a movie with the same title but to me it isn't worth watching. Save your money and watch this one. What I like about Amazon is that you can find movies like this. Trying to find this in a video store would be impossible. Strangely after I bought it I saw it on the Sundance Channel.

It is a very impressive, highly addictive document that will instantly have its hooks in you from episode 1. There are a couple of key things I feel are worth mentioning that I picked up from some of the negative reviews. The main compliant is ""The Staircase"" is presented in a way that makes it look like Michael Peterson is actually innocent and NC wrongly locked him up. I went into this film knowing that Michael Peterson was already found guilty and based on what I have read, do believe he committed the murder. However, watching this film, I can easily see why people can walk away feeling he was wrongly convicted. There were even a couple of times I had a reasonable doubt!The main thing to keep in mind is 80% of the film is shot from the defense's perspective. Most of the footage is taken from the Peterson house, interviews with the kids, his brothers, ex-wife. You candidly are exposed to the defense team and how they set up their strategy to defend Peterson, even after all the bizarre instances are exposed over the course of the investigation and trial. A majority of what you are watching over 6 hours is a family that really wants to believe their father did not murder their mother, and a defense team that is trying their hardness to get a murderer off even though all fingers seem to point right at him.In the bonus features, the director points out that after a couple months, the prosecution did not want the film crew to have 'all-access' pass to their case and refused to let them film, unlike the Peterson family/ defense which was an open book.  The initial intent was to have a balanced story, but it didn't turn out that way. So in the end ""The Staircase"" is not really pure documentary of the murder and trial of Kathleen Peterson. It is more a documentary on Michael Peterson and his family after the murder of their wife/ mother, and how a high-end murder defense team defends their client. Absolutely fascinating. But not a balanced criminal/ judicial documentary.",5,I think it comes down to perspective...,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,2052,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Staircase', 'last', 'night', 'very', 'impressive', 'highly', 'addictive', 'document', 'will', 'instantly', 'have', 'hooks', 'episode', '1', 'are', 'couple', 'key', 'things', 'feel', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'picked', 'up', 'negative', 'reviews', 'main', 'compliant', 'Staircase', 'presented', 'way', 'look', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'actually', 'innocent', 'NC', 'wrongly', 'locked', 'up', 'went', 'film', 'knowing', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'was', 'already', 'found', 'guilty', 'based', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'do', 'believe', 'committed', 'murder', 'However', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'can', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'was', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'were', 'even', 'couple', 'times', 'had', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'main', 'thing', 'keep', 'mind', '80', '%', 'film', 'shot', 'defense', 'perspective', 'Most', 'footage', 'taken', 'Peterson', 'house', 'interviews', 'kids', 'brothers', 'ex-wife', 'candidly', 'are', 'exposed', 'defense', 'team', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'strategy', 'defend', 'Peterson', 'even', 'bizarre', 'instances', 'are', 'exposed', 'course', 'investigation', 'trial', 'majority', 'what', 'are', 'watching', '6', 'hours', 'family', 'really', 'believe', 'father', 'did', 'not', 'murder', 'mother', 'defense', 'team', 'trying', 'hardness', 'get', 'murderer', 'off', 'even', 'fingers', 'seem', 'point', 'right', 'bonus', 'features', 'director', 'out', 'couple', 'months', 'prosecution', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'film', 'crew', 'have', ""'all-access"", 'pass', 'case', 'refused', 'let', 'film', 'Peterson', 'family/', 'defense', 'was', 'open', 'book', 'initial', 'intent', 'was', 'have', 'balanced', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'So', 'end', 'Staircase', 'not', 'really', 'pure', 'documentary', 'murder', 'trial', 'Kathleen', 'Peterson', 'more', 'documentary', 'Michael', 'Peterson', 'family', 'murder', 'wife/', 'mother', 'how', 'high-end', 'murder', 'defense', 'team', 'client', 'Absolutely', 'fascinating', 'not', 'balanced', 'criminal/', 'judicial', 'documentary']",N/A
918470,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000A1INIK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[13, 15]","The Staircase (Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, 2004)When I can sit staring into space for a half an hour after watching a documentary stunned at the outcome, it's a good documentary. When I can do it when I already knew the outcome, we go from good to exceptional pretty fast.Now, before I go anywhere with this: since it seems to be a bone of contention among those who debate the merits of this documentary, whether Michael Peterson is guilty or not is not the thrust of this documentary. Nor was it the thrust of the trial. Trials are not about guilt or innocence-- they are about the creation and destruction of reasonable doubt. A number of the combatants (and there really is no other word to describe them) who have flung words back and forth about this film have either forgotten this, or never knew it in the first place.Lestrade, on the other hand, doesn't seem to care one way or the other. This is an outrageous larger-than-life cast of characters, none of whom seems in the least concerned with the fact that they're all involved in a murder trial. It's not quite as off-the-wall, character-wise, as Gates of Heaven, but it's up there. If you were going to write a satire of a courtroom thriller, you might well come up with characters like these-- the oblivious protagonist, accused of killing his wife in what may be the most improbable manner the prosecution could have chosen; the victim, whose death was improbable no matter what option you considered; the kids/stepkids, who practice a weirdly vacant form of denial; the prosecution, who resemble the shrieking-harridan Greek chorus in a badly-filmed musical; the defense, who come off as competent, but not much more so than the prosecution (the main difference between the two, Lestrade seems to be telling us, is that the defense has a sense of humor); etc.  From the point of view of simply following this cast around like Errol Morris and letting them dig their own holes, The Staircase is an unqualified triumph. Who needs editing to make people look dumb? Just turn the camera on them long enough, they'll do it themselves.For the first half of this, you will likely be as convinced as I was that Lestrade isn't even interested in the trial itself; he was having so much fun with these people that I wondered if the trial would have even opened by the time he'd finished filming. It does (and, in fact, it ends), and at that point, even if Lestrade was just chronicling, we, as viewers, have to concern ourselves with the trial. We have no choice; we're about to spend three hours engrossed in it. A number of us spent a whole lot more time engrossed in it as well, as it was carried, minute by minute, on CourtTV.As far as the trial is concerned, Lestrade's thesis seems to be that no matter how strong the circumstantial evidence, the method of death advanced by the prosecution was so ludicrous as to create reasonable doubt by itself. This seems to be accurate, though Lestrade was certainly not above slanting the footage he ended up showing us to support his point of view. (Interestingly, in the exhaustive lists of forensic evidence not shown to the viewers are a number of things that would have strengthened, not lessened, Lestrade's case that there was reasonable doubt; if he was as biased as people claim when making this film, why were those things not left in?) Still, as with the trial, all the circumstantial and anecdotal evidence is just that. Michael Peterson may be guilty as sin, but unless you can conceive of this crime happening in the way it was presented by the prosecution, how can you not have reasonable doubt? And if you can conceive of the crime in that way, you have a far more vivid imagination than I do.One way or the other, though, Lestrade has created an extremely entertaining, if somewhat jaundiced, look at the American legal system.

Peterson said that he found her at the bottom of a staircase in their North Carolina home. Eventually, prosecutors charged Peterson with her murder.The Staircase covers familiar territory in the age of O.J., Robert Blake, and Phil Spector - the celebrity on trial. The murder charge shatters Peterson's life and causes his family to choose sides. The charges expose unflattering and embarrassing facts about Peterson.The filmmakers have amazing access to Peterson. They film him at home and ask Peterson intimate questions. You feel like a voyeur while watching a man under almost-unbearable pressure. But you cannot stop watching. You watch because Peterson might do or say something that reveals whether he is a murderer.The Staircase is pro-defense. Peterson's attorneys are intelligent, principled, and logical. The prosecutors and judge are bumbling, myopic, and possibly corrupt. One does wonder whether important aspects of the story are missing here.I was very surprised at the Amazon reviewers who said that this film is boring. I watched with my wife and it held our attention for the full six hours. (We watched over several nights). By the end, we both were riveted to the screen.Was justice done? I don't know.

Most of the German nationals do well; one of the defense attorneys does well. The prosecution does not; they seem righteous, smug. The sisters-in-law do not; they seem vindictive with newly-evangelical zeal. The children do not; their emotions seem a bit false. Is it their father they are crying for, or the lifestyle they are about to lose? And then there are those prizes, directly from the crackerjack box: Peterson's ex-wife and the sherrif, gleeful at the site of an exhumation.Everybody is a good character, though. This film is compelling: you want to be viewing; you wanted to be judging. The prosecution does a good job raising doubts that Kathleen Peterson's death was accidental. The million dollar defense does an excellent job raising ""reasonable doubt"" that Michael Peterson murdered her.Doubt--and worry--are somethings you will take away from this film.
