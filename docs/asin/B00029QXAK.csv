828662,AVT2CST57MKDL,B00029QXAK,Abby,"[3, 6]","I just want to say here and now that ""Dogville"" is the first(and so far only) Lars Von Trier film I've seen, and the first time I'd even heard of the man. That said, I won't be comparing this film to any of his previous ones, since I haven't seen them.""Dogville"" is not for the easily offended. It is also not for the easily bored. It is a fascinating, frustrating, beautifully made intellectual film that's really good if you have patience with it. I know lots of reviewers have described the film in such a way that it might be a turnoff to some viewers, but allow me to explain.First of all, the film is shot entirely on a soundstage, and performed in the style of ""Our Town"". Those who haven't seen ""Our Town"" might be a little confused when they see invisible doors being opened and closed, but after a while, the viewer gets used to, even apriciates, the simplicity of the set. There are quite a few camera shots that are beautiful to watch, even if the scene itself is almost unbearable, and, surprsingly, there's a lot of opportunity for symbolism on the director's innovative set, especially at the end.Secondly, just about every reviewer has said that the film is blatantly anti-american. I saw none of that here. It is simply about human nature, and how corruptible we all can be. That said, it's probably best at this point if I explain the plot.The story centers around a mysterious young fugitive named Grace(Nicole Kidman) who arrives in the tiny mountain town of Dogville. She is immediately taken in by Tom(Paul Bettany), a young philosopher who decides to use Grace as a lesson in trying to teach tolerance to his fellow townspeople. Grace helps the citizens of Dogville and attempts to befriend them. The townspeople accept Grace, first reluctantly, then seemingly wholeheartedly. But after a wanted poster featuring the town's newest resident is posted, the townspeople gradually turn on grace, first raping her, then enslaving her, then chaining her up and turning her in to the gangsters she was running from at the start of the film. Even Tom, who eventually falls in love with Grace shows his true colors and sides with the townspeople on the issue after trying to force himself on her.The film ends in a rather odd way that, though unexpected, doesn't really seem right, and is never truly explained. Indeed, even when I listened to the director's commentary for an explanation as to the film's ending, it seemed that Von Trier himself didn't really have an explanation for it, other than ""it was just the way the story had to end"".So that brings us back to film's constant criticism of being very anti-American. First, keep in mind that Von Trier himself is not American, so therefore has every right to make an anti-American film if he so wishes. Also, as I said before, I really didn't say any parts that I thought showed the United States as a whole in a really unfavorable light. It seems that simply because the characters and setting are in the United States, people tend to assume that the film must therefore be anti-American. Again, I'll refer back to the director's commentary. What I took away from that was that Von Trier was not trying to poke sadistic fun at Americans, but that he had made each part of the plot and the film simply because he thought it was artistic.The film ends with David Bowie's ""Young Americans"" with a montage of pictures of poverty-stricken people, which Von Trier says were part of the research that went into the film. I'm not quite sure what to think of this montage, other than that it was really odd, and probably so intellectual and artistic that I wouldn't get it.But my last problem with the film(and the real reason, other than the ending that I gave it three stars) is that the message it gives is that in life there is no hope, only pain and revenge. ""Dogville"" is, at it's heart, a cold, painful movie, though there are happy parts. But these few moments of joy are so rare and so short that I thought Von Trier just shoved them in there to keep people from walking out of the theater so that he could move on the more pain and evil and suffering.Anyway, ""Dogville"" should be seen with at least one other person, if not a group, because it makes for some very interesting conversation afterwards. Are humans really the greedy, conniving creatures that Von Trier makes them out to be? Is there a limit to how many times a person can bring themselves to forgive somebody else? If so, where is the line drawn? Just how nasty were all those rape scenes?So, though it's not exactly a film to be watched solely for entertainment, I do highly reccomend ""Dogville"" to those people who enjoy movies that make them think.",3,A great conversation starter,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,4688,"['just', 'want', 'say', 'here', 'now', 'Dogville', 'first', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'even', 'heard', 'man', 'said', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'comparing', 'film', 'previous', 'ones', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Dogville', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'also', 'not', 'easily', 'bored', 'fascinating', 'frustrating', 'beautifully', 'made', 'intellectual', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'have', 'patience', 'know', 'lots', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'film', 'way', 'might', 'be', 'turnoff', 'viewers', 'allow', 'explain.First', 'film', 'shot', 'entirely', 'soundstage', 'performed', 'style', 'Town', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Town', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'confused', 'when', 'see', 'invisible', 'doors', 'being', 'opened', 'closed', 'while', 'viewer', 'used', 'even', 'simplicity', 'set', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'camera', 'shots', 'are', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'even', 'scene', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'surprsingly', 'lot', 'opportunity', 'symbolism', 'director', 'innovative', 'set', 'especially', 'end.Secondly', 'just', 'reviewer', 'said', 'film', 'blatantly', 'anti-american', 'saw', 'none', 'here', 'simply', 'human', 'nature', 'how', 'corruptible', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'probably', 'best', 'point', 'explain', 'plot.The', 'story', 'centers', 'mysterious', 'young', 'fugitive', 'named', 'Grace', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'tiny', 'mountain', 'town', 'Dogville', 'immediately', 'taken', 'Tom', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'young', 'philosopher', 'who', 'use', 'Grace', 'lesson', 'trying', 'teach', 'tolerance', 'fellow', 'townspeople', 'Grace', 'citizens', 'Dogville', 'attempts', 'befriend', 'townspeople', 'accept', 'Grace', 'first', 'reluctantly', 'then', 'seemingly', 'wholeheartedly', 'wanted', 'poster', 'featuring', 'town', 'newest', 'resident', 'posted', 'townspeople', 'gradually', 'turn', 'grace', 'first', 'raping', 'then', 'enslaving', 'then', 'chaining', 'up', 'turning', 'gangsters', 'was', 'running', 'start', 'film', 'Even', 'Tom', 'who', 'eventually', 'love', 'Grace', 'true', 'colors', 'sides', 'townspeople', 'issue', 'trying', 'force', 'her.The', 'film', 'rather', 'odd', 'way', 'though', 'unexpected', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'right', 'never', 'truly', 'explained', 'Indeed', 'even', 'when', 'listened', 'director', 'commentary', 'explanation', 'film', 'ending', 'seemed', 'Von', 'Trier', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'explanation', 'other', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'story', 'had', 'end', '.So', 'back', 'film', 'constant', 'criticism', 'being', 'very', 'anti-American', 'First', 'keep', 'mind', 'Von', 'Trier', 'not', 'American', 'so', 'therefore', 'right', 'make', 'anti-American', 'film', 'so', 'Also', 'said', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'parts', 'thought', 'showed', 'United', 'States', 'whole', 'really', 'unfavorable', 'light', 'simply', 'characters', 'setting', 'are', 'United', 'States', 'people', 'tend', 'assume', 'film', 'must', 'therefore', 'be', 'anti-American', 'Again', ""'ll"", 'refer', 'back', 'director', 'commentary', 'What', 'took', 'away', 'was', 'Von', 'Trier', 'was', 'not', 'trying', 'poke', 'sadistic', 'fun', 'Americans', 'had', 'made', 'part', 'plot', 'film', 'simply', 'thought', 'was', 'artistic.The', 'film', 'ends', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Young', 'Americans', 'montage', 'pictures', 'poverty-stricken', 'people', 'Von', 'Trier', 'were', 'part', 'research', 'went', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'montage', 'other', 'was', 'really', 'odd', 'probably', 'so', 'intellectual', 'artistic', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.But', 'last', 'problem', 'film', 'real', 'reason', 'other', 'ending', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'message', 'life', 'hope', 'only', 'pain', 'revenge', 'Dogville', 'heart', 'cold', 'painful', 'movie', 'are', 'happy', 'parts', 'few', 'moments', 'joy', 'are', 'so', 'rare', 'so', 'short', 'thought', 'Von', 'Trier', 'just', 'shoved', 'there', 'keep', 'people', 'walking', 'theater', 'so', 'could', 'move', 'more', 'pain', 'evil', 'suffering.Anyway', 'Dogville', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'not', 'group', 'very', 'interesting', 'conversation', 'afterwards', 'Are', 'humans', 'really', 'greedy', 'conniving', 'creatures', 'Von', 'Trier', 'out', 'be', 'there', 'limit', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'person', 'can', 'bring', 'forgive', 'somebody', 'else', 'so', 'where', 'line', 'drawn', 'Just', 'how', 'nasty', 'were', 'rape', 'scenes', 'So', 'not', 'exactly', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'solely', 'entertainment', 'do', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'Dogville', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'make', 'think']",N/A

Is it more arrogant to hold someone to a lower standard and forgive them, or to hold them to a higher standard and judge them accordingly?Very few philosophical movies are as effective as this one, but you have to keep watching through to the very end, otherwise the message will be lost on you.

However, the story line is wonderfully rich and complex and the acting is very well done. You soon find yourself enthralled in the story line and realize that it is so powerful/well done that the lack of visual screen set design is not an issue.All the actors did a wonderful job. I have recommended this movie to many friends. What I find humorous is that all of my friends came back at me with really resenting my recommendation for a film that they initially thought was going to be a bore to thanking me once they watched it to completion.

After a very fast three hours, I was surprised, shocked, amazed, and excited about what I just witnessed.  Film God (if you don't mind me calling him that) Lars von Trier has done it again.  With each film of his that you watch, you can only be more and more impressed with the level of intelligence and passion that he has for his films.  Breaking the Waves was Trier's first film I ever saw, and I still think his story of unbounded love is gut wrenching.  It will make any grown man or woman tear up.  He successfully redefined the musical with Dancer in the Dark giving a platform for singer Bjork to show her talents.  Now, he has come full circle and directed a film that touches such a variety of different topics.  When you watch this film you will see images of women's rights, rape, slavery, depression, poverty, hatred, and justice.For those of you weak of heart, Trier does not sugar coat anything.  He gives us such a powerful stage to watch these actors do their trade that we cannot help but get caught up in everything that they do.  Dogville is a cross between ""Our Town"" and The Godfather with a twist of Trier's other films.  It gives us the story of a woman, passionately played by Nicole Kidman, who chooses to live in a town of corruption because she believes in the human spirit.  The human element is stronger than any evil.  Kidman, literally, gives the performance of her career proving yet again that she is not afraid to tackle any female role.  Her work has continually proved that women can be a dominant force in cinema.  This film is no different.  Add to the mix a powerhouse of independent players like Patricia Clarkson, Chloe Sevigny, John Hurt, James Caan, Lauren Bacall, Jeremy Davies, and Ben Gazzara and Trier's stage-like film is easily transformed into the cinematic event of the decade.To add to the superb acting, you also have the most creative eye in Hollywood today.  The silver screen could not be what it is today without the work of Lars von Trier.  His talent far exceeds anyone else in Hollywood.  If I could time capsule any film in cinema for others to find later, I think it would be Dogville.  From the delicious opening scene to the ending credits which will literally blow your mind and make you see true images of this nation, Trier does not hide anything.  If there is one director on the planet that I would like to meet, it would be him.  I hear he is such an ogre when making these films, yet the finished product is always nothing short of a masterpiece.  I still have those images and song ringing through my mind when the final credits rolled.  It was a completely different atmosphere than the rest of the film, but yet it worked and completely blew my mind.  Trier is the Picasso of the film world.  His art will challenge and destroy any preconceived notions while all the same making you look inside of yourself.This was the best movie made in 2003 with no further doubts in my mind.  To have a canvas that not only allows independent thought, yet covers a topic that is feared is a feat not taken enough in Hollywood.  The acting was phenomenal, the direction was crisp and focused, and the story was disturbing and powerful.  This film broke all other film boundaries.  While I still have trouble understanding every issue brought forth in this film, I cannot wait to watch it again and experience small town America.Bravo to everyone involved with this film.Bravo, Lars von Trier, Bravo!!!Grade:  ***** out of ***** (The best film of 2003!)",5,"Oh, I think you have plenty to offer Dogville.",1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,3615,"['Wow', 'am', 'normally', 'man', 'words', 'reviews', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'Wow', 'very', 'fast', 'three', 'hours', 'was', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'amazed', 'excited', 'what', 'just', 'witnessed', 'Film', 'God', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'calling', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'done', 'again', 'film', 'watch', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'more', 'more', 'impressed', 'level', 'intelligence', 'passion', 'films', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'was', 'Trier', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'still', 'think', 'story', 'unbounded', 'love', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'will', 'make', 'grown', 'man', 'woman', 'tear', 'up', 'successfully', 'redefined', 'musical', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'giving', 'platform', 'singer', 'Bjork', 'show', 'talents', 'Now', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'directed', 'film', 'variety', 'different', 'topics', 'When', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'images', 'women', 'rights', 'rape', 'slavery', 'depression', 'poverty', 'hatred', 'justice.For', 'weak', 'heart', 'Trier', 'not', 'sugar', 'coat', 'anything', 'powerful', 'stage', 'watch', 'actors', 'do', 'trade', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'everything', 'do', 'Dogville', 'cross', 'Town', 'Godfather', 'twist', 'Trier', 'other', 'films', 'story', 'woman', 'passionately', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'live', 'town', 'corruption', 'human', 'spirit', 'human', 'element', 'stronger', 'evil', 'Kidman', 'literally', 'performance', 'career', 'proving', 'yet', 'again', 'not', 'afraid', 'tackle', 'female', 'role', 'work', 'continually', 'proved', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'dominant', 'force', 'cinema', 'film', 'different', 'Add', 'mix', 'powerhouse', 'independent', 'players', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'John', 'Hurt', 'James', 'Caan', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'Trier', 'stage-like', 'film', 'easily', 'transformed', 'cinematic', 'event', 'decade.To', 'add', 'superb', 'acting', 'also', 'have', 'most', 'creative', 'eye', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'silver', 'screen', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'today', 'work', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'talent', 'far', 'anyone', 'else', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'time', 'capsule', 'film', 'cinema', 'others', 'find', 'later', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'Dogville', 'delicious', 'opening', 'scene', 'ending', 'credits', 'will', 'literally', 'blow', 'mind', 'make', 'see', 'true', 'images', 'nation', 'Trier', 'not', 'hide', 'anything', 'one', 'director', 'planet', 'would', 'like', 'meet', 'would', 'be', 'hear', 'such', 'ogre', 'when', 'making', 'films', 'yet', 'finished', 'product', 'always', 'nothing', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'have', 'images', 'song', 'ringing', 'mind', 'when', 'final', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'atmosphere', 'rest', 'film', 'yet', 'worked', 'completely', 'blew', 'mind', 'Trier', 'Picasso', 'film', 'world', 'art', 'will', 'challenge', 'destroy', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'same', 'making', 'look', 'yourself.This', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'made', '2003', 'further', 'doubts', 'mind', 'have', 'canvas', 'not', 'only', 'independent', 'thought', 'topic', 'feared', 'feat', 'not', 'taken', 'enough', 'Hollywood', 'acting', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'direction', 'was', 'crisp', 'focused', 'story', 'was', 'disturbing', 'powerful', 'film', 'broke', 'other', 'film', 'boundaries', 'still', 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'issue', 'brought', 'forth', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'watch', 'again', 'experience', 'small', 'town', 'America.Bravo', 'everyone', 'involved', 'film.Bravo', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Bravo', 'Grade', '*****', '*****', 'best', 'film', '2003']",N/A

828669,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00029QXAK,Alex Udvary,"[7, 11]","""Dogville"" is one of those movies that inspired hate within me. Don't misinterpret what I'm saying. I don't mean I hate the movie, and I don't simply mean I hate the characters. My feelings dwell deeper than that. What I mean is after watching it I had a hate for society. Few movies have challenged me in such a way.One was Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"". It's amazing that people would want to cause such harm to others. And ""Focus"". A movie about a man who is mistakenly seen as Jewish and now must encounter the same social problems.Lars von Trier's ""Dogville"" will push many viewers to the limit. But Trier has high ambitions with this one. Von Trier is one of the most consistantly bold and daring filmmakers we have through such masterpieces as ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"".""Dogville"" is filmed as if it were played on stage. What does that mean? There are no ""real"" houses. People pretend to be opening doors. There is chalk with the name of streets on them. There is even one that has the word 'dog' written on it with a bone.I admit at first this bothered me. I would have rather seen the actually locations, but, after a while you adjust. So don't harp on it. If you do, you'll stop yourself from enjoying the movie.Nicole Kidman plays Grace a young woman on the run from gangsters and finds herself in the small town of Dogville. The first person she meets is Tom Edison, a morale crusader of the town. Tom wants to help her and has to try on convince the other citizens of town (including Lauren Bacall, Harriet Andersson, Chloe Sevigny, Stellan Skarsgard, and Patricia Clarkson) to help hide her from the gangsters.And soon ""Dogville' takes on the themes revenge, greed, lust, fear, and vindictiveness. It also describes the characters of this small town.Many have called the film anti-American. Well, believe it or not I'm too smart to open that can of worms. So I'll just say the movie is anti-American to those who want it to be.""Dogville"" is one of the year's best films. It has a performance by Nicole Kidman that is arguably her bravest yet. But I can assure you she stands no chance of getting nominated for an Oscar for her work here. She would more likely be nominated for ""The Stepford Wives"" than this. Nor sadly will Trier's scrpit get nominated. It is more ambitious than any other script so far this year. It touches on more social problems than any other film except maybe ""The Passion of the Christ"". And there's little chance ""Dogville"" will be nominated for ""Best Picture"".

828672,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00029QXAK,Andrew Ellington,"[9, 11]","`Dogville' is one of those films that you really have to see multiple times to really appreciate.  Maybe that is the case with all good films, for no film can really be considered a masterpiece after one solitary viewing (or can they?).  I've seen `Dogville' a number of times, and even though I was quick to laud it after one viewing alone, it has really settled with me as one of the most important and most controversially monumental films of the past decade, maybe even forever, the more I see it.With each frame, director Lars von Trier has captured something so organic and so human it is the epitome of brilliance.Now, I totally understand why people may hate this film, or find it pretentious and `artsy' (I really hate that label).  For me, this is BY FAR von Trier's finest film.  It is visual impacting, morally aggressive and seemingly conflicted in its direction.  The films final moment (where everything comes to a brutal and shocking conclusion) is one of the most visually and mentally exhausting sequences in film this past decade (maybe even forever) and it is for that reason that I feel this film could be labeled confusing or even pointless.  It is far from pointless, but I can see why some may draw that conclusion.  The films pacing and the way in which the film is painted (the stale, almost vacant visual surroundings) can be off-putting to some, especially those belonging to the A.D.D. generation spawned by overindulgence in Michael Bay cinema.  That addressed, it is the pacing and seemingly plain surroundings that add so much depth to the production.  The chalk outlined template used as the basis for the films unraveling has so much meaning and carries with it so much weight.  Sure, it is definitely `artsy', but it is art with a direct and poignant message.Let me just say, labeling a film `artsy' in an attempt to discredit it as `trying to hard' or not really being `entertainment' is a joke when you consider the fact that cinema is an art form used as a way to express the opinions and concerns of the writer/director/actors.`Dogville' tells the story of Grace, a beautiful stranger fleeing gangsters who winds up in the small town of Dogville seeking some sort of solace.  Tom, the towns moral guide, persuades the townsfolk to give Grace a chance, and while they are at once skeptical, they let their guard down and welcome Grace into their lives.  She performs various odd-jobs for the townsfolk and garners their respect and friendship, until they label her costly and decide to take full advantage of her in order to make up for what she `could' cost them in the end.  They eventually turn to tormenting her (in brutal and rather grotesque ways) which leads to one of the most heartbreaking and gut-wrenching conclusions in cinematic history.The coldness is haunting.The film is a brilliantly conceived piece of filmmaking that really develops and portrays a consistent and powerful line of thinking.  Von Trier understands how to create a deeply compelling story with very little at his disposal.  The fact that the film is not tied down or overstuffed with any visual grandeur also helps keep our focus on the unraveling plot, which dissects the morality of human frailty magnificently.To say that understanding `Dogville' means that we understand the darkest parts of our very being would not be an overstatement.With sublime acting on all fronts (Patricia Clarkson is at her brutal best and deserves to be singled out here) and a steady and capable man sitting in the director's chair, `Dogivlle' is a masterpiece.  Few films address such poignant and controversial subjects with the blunt honesty needed to make the audience truly listen to what is being spoken.  Sure, it can be aggressive and distasteful to some, but maybe that is because this film says something we don't want to hear.But maybe we need to hear it.",5,Sometimes the hardest words to hear are the ones we need to hear the most...,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,3869,"['Dogville', 'one', 'films', 'really', 'have', 'see', 'multiple', 'times', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Maybe', 'case', 'good', 'films', 'film', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'considered', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'solitary', 'viewing', 'can', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dogville', 'number', 'times', 'even', 'was', 'quick', 'laud', 'one', 'viewing', 'alone', 'really', 'settled', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'most', 'controversially', 'monumental', 'films', 'past', 'decade', 'maybe', 'even', 'forever', 'more', 'see', 'it.With', 'frame', 'director', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'captured', 'something', 'so', 'organic', 'so', 'human', 'epitome', 'brilliance.Now', 'totally', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'may', 'hate', 'film', 'find', 'pretentious', 'artsy', 'really', 'hate', 'label', 'BY', 'FAR', 'von', 'Trier', 'finest', 'film', 'visual', 'impacting', 'morally', 'aggressive', 'seemingly', 'conflicted', 'direction', 'films', 'final', 'moment', 'where', 'everything', 'brutal', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'mentally', 'exhausting', 'sequences', 'film', 'past', 'decade', 'maybe', 'even', 'forever', 'reason', 'feel', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'labeled', 'confusing', 'even', 'pointless', 'far', 'pointless', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'may', 'draw', 'conclusion', 'films', 'pacing', 'way', 'film', 'painted', 'stale', 'almost', 'vacant', 'visual', 'surroundings', 'can', 'be', 'off-putting', 'especially', 'belonging', 'A.D.D', 'generation', 'spawned', 'overindulgence', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'cinema', 'addressed', 'pacing', 'seemingly', 'plain', 'surroundings', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'production', 'chalk', 'outlined', 'template', 'used', 'basis', 'films', 'unraveling', 'so', 'much', 'meaning', 'so', 'much', 'weight', 'Sure', 'definitely', 'artsy', 'art', 'direct', 'poignant', 'message.Let', 'just', 'say', 'labeling', 'film', 'artsy', 'attempt', 'discredit', 'trying', 'hard', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'entertainment', 'joke', 'when', 'consider', 'fact', 'cinema', 'art', 'form', 'used', 'way', 'express', 'opinions', 'concerns', 'writer/director/actors.', 'Dogville', 'story', 'Grace', 'beautiful', 'stranger', 'fleeing', 'gangsters', 'who', 'winds', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'Dogville', 'seeking', 'sort', 'solace', 'Tom', 'towns', 'moral', 'guide', 'townsfolk', 'give', 'Grace', 'chance', 'are', 'once', 'skeptical', 'let', 'guard', 'welcome', 'Grace', 'lives', 'various', 'odd-jobs', 'townsfolk', 'garners', 'respect', 'friendship', 'label', 'costly', 'decide', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'order', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'could', 'cost', 'end', 'eventually', 'turn', 'tormenting', 'brutal', 'rather', 'grotesque', 'ways', 'one', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'gut-wrenching', 'conclusions', 'cinematic', 'history.The', 'coldness', 'haunting.The', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'really', 'consistent', 'powerful', 'line', 'thinking', 'Von', 'Trier', 'how', 'create', 'deeply', 'compelling', 'story', 'very', 'little', 'disposal', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'tied', 'down', 'overstuffed', 'visual', 'grandeur', 'also', 'keep', 'focus', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'morality', 'human', 'frailty', 'magnificently.To', 'say', 'understanding', 'Dogville', 'understand', 'darkest', 'parts', 'very', 'being', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'overstatement.With', 'sublime', 'acting', 'fronts', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'brutal', 'best', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'here', 'steady', 'capable', 'man', 'sitting', 'director', 'chair', 'Dogivlle', 'masterpiece', 'Few', 'films', 'address', 'such', 'poignant', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'blunt', 'honesty', 'needed', 'make', 'audience', 'truly', 'what', 'being', 'spoken', 'Sure', 'can', 'be', 'aggressive', 'distasteful', 'maybe', 'film', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear.But', 'maybe', 'need', 'hear']",N/A

And I didn't even hate it in a way that would inspire comment or conversation, but simply as a needlessly brutal exercise in one man's prejudice (von Trier) against, well, just about everything. But most of all America and its ideas.This is a film that uglifies everything it depicts, everything it touches. The film seems coated with a layer of grime. It depicts gang rape, mass murder, the ugliest sides of human nature, while supposedly presenting an overly stagey &quot;parable&quot; (Our Town-style, on a mostly empty set) about small towns and (most of all) America. Von Trier's view is disturbing, ugly, needlessly brutal, and in the end a betrayal of all the amazing actors who worked on the film.The performances are great, and I give 1 star for them alone. Nicole Kidman in particular manages to stay luminous and poignant even through violence, brutality, gang rape, ugliness, murder, you name it. I know some admire this film, but to me its pretensions to art were mostly what offended me about it. The film is a paen to Von Trier's simplistic view that America is corrupt and (ultimately) hopeless. I love America but I do so with a mind as well as a heart; I don't mind discourse, exploration, etc., as a pathway to ideas.But to me this film ultimately is pretentious slop, a way for this guy to wage his one-man war against American ideas and daily life by painting a truly ugly picture and saying, &quot;See yourself there?&quot; I love dark stuff, but no, I didn't. I actually felt sorry for Von Trier -- at this point I feel he's someone who only seems to see what he wants, which most of the time seems to be the worst in people.Ultimately the story is so silly and over the top that I wasn't even angry -- I felt like I'd watched something completely ludicrous. The film doesn't work even as a parable, despite the few favorable reviews mentioning names like &quot;Shirley Jackson,&quot; etc. The film has nothing in common with Jackson's quiet devastation -- Von Trier would rather hit you over the head with a hammer to make a point.Stay away from this one, it's not worth a rental, much less an actual purchase.",1,A really ugly little film...,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,2243,"['Oh', 'man', 'hated', 'film', ""'m"", 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'almost', 'movie', 'genre', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'hate', 'way', 'would', 'inspire', 'comment', 'conversation', 'simply', 'needlessly', 'brutal', 'exercise', 'one', 'man', 'prejudice', 'Trier', 'well', 'just', 'everything', 'most', 'America', 'ideas.This', 'film', 'everything', 'everything', 'film', 'coated', 'layer', 'grime', 'gang', 'rape', 'mass', 'murder', 'ugliest', 'sides', 'human', 'nature', 'supposedly', 'presenting', 'overly', 'stagey', 'quot', 'parable', 'quot', 'Town-style', 'mostly', 'empty', 'set', 'small', 'towns', 'most', 'America', 'Von', 'Trier', 'view', 'disturbing', 'ugly', 'needlessly', 'brutal', 'end', 'betrayal', 'amazing', 'actors', 'who', 'worked', 'film.The', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'give', '1', 'star', 'alone', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'particular', 'manages', 'stay', 'luminous', 'poignant', 'even', 'violence', 'brutality', 'gang', 'rape', 'ugliness', 'murder', 'name', 'know', 'admire', 'film', 'pretensions', 'art', 'were', 'mostly', 'what', 'offended', 'film', 'paen', 'Von', 'Trier', 'simplistic', 'view', 'America', 'corrupt', 'ultimately', 'hopeless', 'love', 'America', 'do', 'so', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'heart', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'discourse', 'exploration', 'etc.', 'pathway', 'ideas.But', 'film', 'ultimately', 'pretentious', 'slop', 'way', 'guy', 'wage', 'one-man', 'war', 'American', 'ideas', 'daily', 'life', 'painting', 'truly', 'ugly', 'picture', 'saying', 'quot', 'See', 'there', 'quot', 'love', 'dark', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Von', 'Trier', 'point', 'feel', 'someone', 'who', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'most', 'time', 'be', 'worst', 'people.Ultimately', 'story', 'so', 'silly', 'top', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'angry', 'felt', ""'d"", 'watched', 'something', 'completely', 'ludicrous', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'even', 'parable', 'few', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'mentioning', 'names', 'quot', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'quot', 'film', 'nothing', 'common', 'Jackson', 'quiet', 'devastation', 'Von', 'Trier', 'would', 'rather', 'hit', 'head', 'hammer', 'make', 'point.Stay', 'away', 'one', 'not', 'worth', 'rental', 'much', 'less', 'actual', 'purchase']",N/A

I knew very little before seeing the movie, and know very little now, of the film's director and writer, Lars von Trier.  The mega-talented cast (of which includes Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, James Caan, Patricia Clarkson, Paul Bettany and more) is what compelled me to check it out, and thank God for that.What is important to convey first is that this movie is unlike any other with regards to set design and stage direction.  There are few props besides the clothes that each character wears, and little more than a large black room with white outlines on its floor in the place of walls and doors, trees and roads.  This will put many potential views off before they even begin watching the film - I know, because I hardly had interest in such a bizarre arrangement myself... no doors?!  You've got to be mad, Lars!Watching this movie puts a new perspective on cinema.  If you become as submersed in the film as I have, you'll likely never see another movie the same way again - a new angle is opened up.  The angle of a character's emotions becomes the central device rather than action shots or props commanding your attention.Grace (Kidman) is a wealthy woman on the run from gangsters when she stumbles across a quaint town full of honest, hard-working people willing to save a ravaged soul like hers.  What we find is that those who are willing to save us can be just as apt to annihilate us for their own survival.  I might say that this movie features the greatest twists I have ever seen develop on screen, but they're far more than twists, they're erratic developments of unfathomable and philosophical proportions.  If you let it, the power of this movie has the capacity to blow your mind.""Dogville"" is an examination of the human condition, as seen through the eyes of a small American town, located somewhere in the Smokey Mountains.  The way these humans react to guilt, desire, and threat can shock the views' soul to the core.  It's a profound experience to see emotion running so raw, so vivid, and so extreme.

828681,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00029QXAK,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 3]","`Dogville', a three-hour filmed stage play by writer and director Lars von Trier is not for everyone, and that, dear reader, is an understatement. The A-List cast headed by Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, James Caan, Ben Gazzara, and John Hurt and the synopsis of the plot may give one the impression that this is a sleeper thriller waiting to be discovered.For starters, all the business takes place on a rather large stage, measuring perhaps 40 by 60 yards, probably the floor of a large sound stage. The stage setting owes much to the technique used in Thornton Wilder's classic play `Our Town' as it was originally produced on Broadway, not in the much more conventional setting we see in the movie made of the play. But, this production takes this basic notion much further. There are practically no flats depicting walls. All walls of all buildings in `Dogville' are marked by chalk marks on the floor of the stage, easily seen when the entire stage is photographed from a ceiling camera placed about 60 feet above the level of the floor. Almost all other features of buildings and fixtures are also represented by the same kind of chalkmarks. The only props are benches, chairs, beds, bookcases, and figurines actually used by the actors. Some very few key items such as the top of the steeple on the meetinghouse are present, hanging in midair to serve as a sign that this is the meetinghouse. Even the berry bushes often discussed and the dog after which one senses the town was named are represented by chalk outlines on the floor. An abandoned mine is represented by nothing more than a series of three or four timber reinforcement post and lentil sets lined up to outline the passage of the tunnel entrance. And this is just the beginning of the strangeness.The parallel with `Our Town' continues with the presence of a narrator of whom we only hear his voice. Unlike `Our Town', he does not appear `in the flesh' as a stage manager or any other character. The town, `Dogville' is an old mining town very much off the beaten track and on its last leg in the journey to ghost town status. Just a little more weird atmosphere to the setting, there is a constant thud of piledrivers heard in the distance where a construction crew is placing piles to anchor a new prison in a nearby marsh.The most prominent citizen of this small town is the local doctor Thomas Edison Sr., with no apparent connection except by name to the famous inventor. The main character among the residents of the town is his son, Thomas Edison Jr., played by Paul Bettany, whose proclaimed vocation is `writer'; however, he spends practically no time writing, claiming that he is gathering material from interaction with his neighbors.The story opens as Tom Jr. hears some gunshots over the sound of the piledrivers and runs into a young woman played by Nicole Kidman who is apparently fleeing from something, probably something connected with the gunshots. Soon afterward, a very fancy 1930's automobile shows up decked out with all the trappings of an Al Capone era mob bosses limousine. The driver asks Tom Jr. if he has seen a young girl, who he has just hidden in the old mineshaft. He claims ignorance of the girl and is given a business card by a shadowy hand attached to the occupant of the rear seat in the car with a voice which sounds like it comes straight from `The Godfather'. Since the actor providing the voice is James Caan, the voice did come straight from `The Godfather'.Much of the movie from that point on deals with the townsfolk's' agreeing to hide Kidman beginning with a two week trial period. In payment, Kidman's character attempts to do work for the town's few residents. At first they find nothing for her to do, but Edison Jr. points out things at which she can help. Once the movie settles down to accommodate the new girl in town, the dialogue and voice-over commentary begins going into very seriously impressionistic observations on town, life, and events. This is dialogue and narrative one may expect from Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Harold Pinter, Berthold Brecht or Henrik Ibsen. These are not sentences you will find in a script by Blake Edwards or even by Woody Alan or Robert Altman. Oddly, the ending is a big surprise and could have been conceived and written by Quentin Tarantino or Sam Peckinpah.As the ending and the way in which the story gets there is quite a surprise, I am reluctant to tell much more of the story. I will only repeat my warning that if you slip this DVD into you player, be prepared for a very weird, very cerebral ride with a stark surprise. I will only say that the ending is a serious homage to Kurt Weill's very popular song `Pirate Jenny'.My four star rating is less a reflection of the quality of the production than it is a warning to check your expectations at the door when you enter this party. All performances are delightful, especially from the rarely seen Ben Gazarra and the luminously legendary Lauren BaCall. Cinematography is rudimentary, but it doesn't have to be great on this kind of set. Lighting is just as quirky as the stagesettings. Blocking shots does seem a bit awkward at times, but it does not distract from the very strange things coming out of the actors' mouths.Oh, by the way, the dog does actually make an appearance in the final scene. And, I agree with another reviewer that this movie is not anti-American. I was not aware of the charge, but the thought never entered my mind as I was watching the movie.",4,"'Our Town' done darkly, with a Tarantino Twist",1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,5512,"['Dogville',

828689,A95SF04RX9G8,B00029QXAK,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[13, 27]","Lar von Trier's Dogville is an ambitious motion picture. It is also contrived, self-indulgent, fatally overlong, and ultimately downright repulsive. Dogville tells the story of what happens when Grace (Nicole Kidman), on the run from gangsters, stumbles upon the small Rocky Mountain town of Dogville. She first encounters Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), the town's resident big thinker, who manages to convince the townspeople to offer Grace refuge, but in exchange they demand that she visit everyone in town once a day to help out with whatever chores they need help with.The townspeople consist of a number of ominous personalities: the gooseberry bush-protecting Ma Ginger (Lauren Bacall), the blind old man Jack McKay (Ben Gazzara), the dumb wannabe engineer Bill Henson (Jeremy Davies) and his sister Liz (Chloe Sevigney), the apple picker Chuck (Stellan Skarsgaard) and his wife Vera (Patricia Clarkson) and their many children, the silent Martha (Siobhan Fallon), the professional freight carrier Ben (Zeljko Ivanek), and Tom's dad Tom Edison, Sr. (Philip Baker Hall)At first, the townspeople seem shy and unwilling to accept Grace, but she does her best to accommodate them in the hopes that they will let her stay in town and avoid her troubles elsewhere. However, once the people of Dogville get to know Grace better, they treat her with unflinching cruelty and coldness - she is raped on numerous occasions by numerous people, as one example. Tom does his best to help Grace deal with everything - he's falling in love with her, and she with him - but there's only so much one man can do when he's trying to be accepted by both sides.So, let me talk first about what I liked about the movie. The entire film is shot on a single stage, which represents the town of Dogville. Walls and props are few and far between, as the buildings are identified by outlines and text painted on the stage. It gives the film the feel of live theater, but with the freedom of film cuts and edits. Von Trier uses a handheld camera throughout, as he does in most his films. Because there are no distractions by way of setpieces, the actors are given the opportunity to shine, and shine they do. The only acting quirk that really bothered me was that Paul Bettany, who is British, could not seem to settle on one single American accent - he couldn't decide whether he was from the North or the South, East or West, or the ambiguous area in between all of these we call the Midwest.Now, what was bad: the plot and the characters. Grace and Tom are two of the dumbest movie characters who make some of the worst decisions I have ever seen. Dumb movie characters are okay, but not when they're passed off as intelligent. Grace hangs around this town and takes abuse from these small-town folk for no reason. She doesn't tell anyone except Tom about any of it, and he's even worse than her. He's supposed to be this man with all of these great ideas, except all of his ideas are absolutely terrible. There isn't a single character you can even relate to in the entire movie - they're all inexplicably despicable.And did I mention that Dogville takes three hours to tell a story so simple it could be told in about fifteen minutes worth of film? Plus, there is an overbearing narrator (John Hurt) who explains every last detail, instead of allowing the actors to express the emotions of the characters and allowing the audience to interpret those emotions. There is nothing wrong with making ambitious films, but if an ambitious film fails, it makes it ten times worse than when a formula film fails, because there is so much unfulfilled promise.

828690,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00029QXAK,Clare Quilty,"[4, 5]","... it takes your head off.""Dogville"" reminds me of that old story about how Andy Kaufman, back when he was alive and still doing stand-up routines, used to go into comedy clubs and jump onstage and psych up the crowd. . . and then proceed to read huge sections of ""The Great Gatsby"" into the microphone - no funny voices, no winking, just page after page recited in a clipped voice.Sometimes the audience grew hostile, sometimes the audience walked out, a small minority found it ingenious but whatever the response, Kaufman read the book until he wanted to stop.And while having F. Scott Fitzgerald read to you is arguably a worthwhile way to spend an evening, that understandably wasn't the evening most of the patrons wanted yet Kaufman did it just to rub them the wrong way.""Dogville"" is the same kind of deal: It's definitely worthwhile, but it wants to rub viewers the wrong way; some will grow hostile, some will stop watching and a small minority will find it ingenious.The movie stars Nicole Kidman, and was directed by Lars von Trier, who made the similarly challenging ""Dancer in the Dark"" and ""Breaking the Waves."" It's a two-hour, 57-minute drama set in the tiny Colorado town of Dogville in what might be the 1930s. The entire film, however, takes place on a large, mostly empty stage. Buildings and houses and even a household pet are designated by chalklines on the floor; daytime is indicated by blinding white light beyond the perimeter of the set, nighttime by impenetrable blackness; and the population consists of 15 unwashed, crotchety adults and a few creepy kids.Kidman plays Grace, a mysterious woman who winds up in town on the run from both gangsters and the police. The citizens are suspicious at first but agree to hide her and, in exchange, she helps them with chores. For a while everyone is happier, but the heroines in von Trier movies rarely avoid injury and humiliation at the hands of angry mobs and, sure enough, Grace's relationship with Dogville soon sours, and the people take greater and greater advantage of her until finally she wishes the gangsters would find her.So what we have here is a three-hour chronicle of unlikable people doing cruel things to a nice woman against a boring back-drop. There are also hints that Von Trier is lashing out specifically at America (the action takes place on a street called Elm, a particularly spineless character is named Tom Edison, Grace's circumstances take a turn for the worst on Independence Day and ""Young Americans"" plays over the end credits).Obviously, this is not a movie with mass appeal and although I admire von Trier's will to be weird, I slogged through the first two-thirds of ""Dogville"" like it was a homework assignment; it's tedious for long stretches and sometimes feels like bloated bad theater.I'm glad I stuck with it, though, because the movie delivers one tremendous wallop at the end, when an audacious and complex twist occurs and we find out what the movie is really all about. But is it a compliment to say that a film becomes engrossing after the first hour-and-a-half, and that it really pays off if you can make it through the first 160 minutes? I'm not sure, but I know that without the excessive length, it probably wouldn't pack the same punch. And I'm also pretty sure that while many who see it will find ""Dogville"" dullsville, others will see it as a bitter allegory about slavery, exploitation and casual corruption and, to an extent, both groups will be correct.",4,Just when you think the bomb isn't going to explode...,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,3487,"['head', 'Dogville', 'old', 'story', 'how', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'still', 'doing', 'stand-up', 'routines', 'used', 'go', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'jump', 'onstage', 'psych', 'up', 'crowd', 'then', 'proceed', 'read', 'huge', 'sections', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'microphone', 'funny', 'voices', 'winking', 'just', 'page', 'page', 'recited', 'clipped', 'audience', 'grew', 'hostile', 'sometimes', 'audience', 'walked', 'out', 'small', 'minority', 'found', 'ingenious', 'whatever', 'response', 'Kaufman', 'read', 'book', 'wanted', 'stop.And', 'having', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'read', 'arguably', 'worthwhile', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'understandably', 'was', ""n't"", 'evening', 'most', 'patrons', 'wanted', 'yet', 'Kaufman', 'did', 'just', 'rub', 'wrong', 'way', 'Dogville', 'same', 'kind', 'deal', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'rub', 'viewers', 'wrong', 'way', 'will', 'grow', 'hostile', 'will', 'stop', 'watching', 'small', 'minority', 'will', 'find', 'ingenious.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'was', 'directed', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'who', 'made', 'similarly', 'challenging', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'two-hour', '57-minute', 'drama', 'set', 'tiny', 'Colorado', 'town', 'Dogville', 'what', 'might', 'be', '1930s', 'entire', 'film', 'however', 'place', 'large', 'mostly', 'empty', 'stage', 'Buildings', 'houses', 'even', 'household', 'pet', 'are', 'designated', 'chalklines', 'floor', 'daytime', 'indicated', 'blinding', 'white', 'light', 'perimeter', 'set', 'nighttime', 'impenetrable', 'blackness', 'population', '15', 'unwashed', 'crotchety', 'adults', 'few', 'creepy', 'kids.Kidman', 'Grace', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'town', 'run', 'gangsters', 'police', 'citizens', 'are', 'suspicious', 'first', 'agree', 'hide', 'exchange', 'chores', 'while', 'everyone', 'happier', 'heroines', 'von', 'Trier', 'movies', 'rarely', 'avoid', 'injury', 'humiliation', 'hands', 'angry', 'mobs', 'sure', 'enough', 'Grace', 'relationship', 'Dogville', 'soon', 'sours', 'people', 'take', 'greater', 'greater', 'advantage', 'finally', 'gangsters', 'would', 'find', 'her.So', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'three-hour', 'chronicle', 'unlikable', 'people', 'doing', 'cruel', 'things', 'nice', 'woman', 'boring', 'back-drop', 'are', 'also', 'hints', 'Von', 'Trier', 'lashing', 'out', 'specifically', 'America', 'action', 'place', 'street', 'called', 'Elm', 'particularly', 'spineless', 'character', 'named', 'Tom', 'Edison', 'Grace', 'circumstances', 'take', 'turn', 'worst', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Young', 'Americans', 'end', 'credits', '.Obviously', 'not', 'movie', 'mass', 'appeal', 'admire', 'von', 'Trier', 'will', 'be', 'weird', 'slogged', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'Dogville', 'was', 'homework', 'assignment', 'tedious', 'long', 'stretches', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'bloated', 'bad', 'theater.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'stuck', 'though', 'movie', 'one', 'tremendous', 'wallop', 'end', 'when', 'audacious', 'complex', 'twist', 'occurs', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'compliment', 'say', 'film', 'engrossing', 'first', 'hour-and-a-half', 'really', 'can', 'make', 'first', '160', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'know', 'excessive', 'length', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'pack', 'same', 'punch', ""'m"", 'also', 'pretty', 'sure', 'many', 'who', 'see', 'will', 'find', 'Dogville', 'dullsville', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'bitter', 'allegory', 'slavery', 'exploitation', 'casual', 'corruption', 'extent', 'groups', 'will', 'be', 'correct']",N/A

828692,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B00029QXAK,C.Wallace,"[2, 2]","I have never seen a dramatic performance as powerful as that of Nicole Kidman in this film. She portrays Grace Mulligan, who seeks refuge in Dogville, a very small village (fifteen adults, seven children). Dogville is in a remote mountainous pocket of desperate poverty during the Great Depression of the 1930's. It's accessible by only one mountain road. The one radio in town only plays music. No news. It's like Dogville makes up its own shabby little world.Grace is running away from gangsters. She is at the mercy of the townspeople, all of whom know that she is hiding from grave danger. So, she depends on the milk of human kindness.For the most part, Dogville's residents appear to be kind and compassionate toward Grace at first. But that's before they start thinking that Grace just might be the perfect victim...The film reinforces the Hobbesian notion that many do the right thing only because they fear retribution for behaving poorly. So, how do people treat someone who is totally at their mercy? That is, how do people act once they think that there is no possibility of retribution?The production of the film is unique. It's set on a bare-bones stage. People act like they are opening and closing doors; there are no actual doors. Walls are just lines on the floor. The most substantial props are cars and a truck used in a few scenes.Once I got over the unusual staging, I realized that the acting was all that mattered. Kidman's performance is remarkable as Grace comes to learn, the hard way, how cruel people can be. It all builds to a shocking, explosive, conclusion. All of the acting is solid, but, for the most part, the others could just play off of Kidman's work.",5,No Puppies in Dogville,1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,1690,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'as', 'powerful', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'film', 'Grace', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'refuge', 'Dogville', 'very', 'small', 'village', 'fifteen', 'adults', 'seven', 'children', 'Dogville', 'remote', 'mountainous', 'pocket', 'desperate', 'poverty', 'Great', 'Depression', '1930', 'accessible', 'only', 'one', 'mountain', 'road', 'one', 'radio', 'town', 'only', 'music', 'news', 'Dogville', 'up', 'own', 'shabby', 'little', 'world.Grace', 'running', 'away', 'gangsters', 'mercy', 'townspeople', 'whom', 'know', 'hiding', 'grave', 'danger', 'So', 'milk', 'human', 'kindness.For', 'most', 'part', 'Dogville', 'residents', 'appear', 'be', 'kind', 'compassionate', 'Grace', 'first', 'start', 'thinking', 'Grace', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'perfect', 'victim', 'film', 'Hobbesian', 'notion', 'many', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'only', 'fear', 'retribution', 'behaving', 'poorly', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'people', 'treat', 'someone', 'who', 'totally', 'mercy', 'how', 'do', 'people', 'act', 'once', 'think', 'possibility', 'retribution', 'production', 'film', 'unique', 'set', 'bare-bones', 'stage', 'People', 'act', 'are', 'opening', 'closing', 'doors', 'are', 'actual', 'doors', 'Walls', 'are', 'just', 'lines', 'floor', 'most', 'substantial', 'props', 'are', 'cars', 'truck', 'used', 'few', 'scenes.Once', 'got', 'unusual', 'staging', 'realized', 'acting', 'was', 'mattered', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'Grace', 'learn', 'hard', 'way', 'how', 'cruel', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'builds', 'shocking', 'explosive', 'conclusion', 'acting', 'solid', 'most', 'part', 'others', 'could', 'just', 'play', 'off', 'Kidman', 'work']",N/A
828693,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00029QXAK,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[9, 11]","`Dogville' is a unique look at human interaction.  Set in the town of Dogville where the people live in close quarters away from the rest of the world a young woman, a stranger, named Grace (Kidman) comes to escape a group of gangsters seeking her.  Tom (Bettany), who feels he needs to be the moral guide to the town, feels that accepting Grace into their lives and helping her will help the town build character.  So, with all in agreement, they give her two weeks to prove herself no danger to the community, and so with the help from Tom she begins to prove herself by doing jobs here and then for the community.This small town consisted of many different people, some who embrace Grace right off and others that warm up to her over time.  There's Gloria (Harriet Andersson) who is in charge of ringing the bell to sound off every hour that passes, and there's the Henson household, Liz (Chloe Sevigny) the daughter who wants to get out of town, and Bill (Jeremy Davies) the son who dreams of a better education and a good career.  There's Vera (Clarkson) and Chuck (Skarsgard), the couple with too many children and not enough love between them to make it work.  There's Ben (Ivanek), a somewhat slow freight man who visits the house of ill repute on many occasions.  And there's Tom and his father Tom Sr. (Philip Baker Hall) the doctor.As Grace cowers to their every command they begin to accept her, that is until they deem her more costly then she's worth and start to abuse her friendship in order to make up the difference.  Their cruelty turns to brutality, but it shows the selfishness in human nature.  The film burns down to a brutal ending, a surprising and controversial ending that makes this tragic tale all the more real and important to the grown of society.The film is shot in an interesting format; the set's set up as if watching a play, with everything open and exposed, no doors or walls, just a chalk outline on the floor to distinguish living arrangements.  I found this a very interesting way to film the picture and felt it adds to the air that everything in this town is open and exposed to all, nothing hidden, nothing sacred but everything shared.  Some have found this film offensive, but I find it inspiring.  I find it truthful and important and courageous for it isn't shy about exposing the faults in human's but gives to a dramatic portrait of the worst in all of us.The acting on the parts of the entire cast is subtle yet powerful, Nicole grabbing her character and becoming her, portraying her for who she is, not hiding anything from the viewer.  Paul Bettany also does a great job adding depth to his character, showing pure hearted naivety.  But it's Skarsgard and Clarkson to me that really stand out, delivering knock out performances that transformed them from actors into people.

828694,AQ990HW13DP08,B00029QXAK,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[0, 0]","In this much-maligned film, the Danish writer and director Lars von Trier paints a dark portrait of the human spirit in both its communal and individual dimensions. He suggests that lurking beneath our veneer of social respectability, and even our best of intentions, there is something wild and dangerous deep in the human heart. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a fugitive on the run from gangsters who seeks refuge in Dogville, a tiny town of fifteen people set in the Colorado Rockies at the turn of the century. At first petty, suspicious, and insular, after a two-week trial the citizens loosen up and provide Grace the haven she seeks. But eventually the town turns on her, viciously, despite the many ways she has served them. Grace forgives them, the victim blaming herself, and then later undergoes her own moral transformation and exacts vicious retribution. The victim becomes the new oppressor. This film watches more like a movie of a play. The entire production takes place on one, large sound stage. The town streets, bushes, etc., are mere chalk lines. The houses are sparse frames without doors. John Hurt narrates the successive ""chapters."" At 177 minutes, the film is long.

828695,A3GRANSGMYPX00,B00029QXAK,"Danielle Kuehnel ""A Trendy Twentysomething""","[5, 8]","'Dogville' was the type of film that I never would have expected, and never will forget. The most obvious, and odd, part of the film was that there was barely a set - no walls, no doors, just a chalk outline of what is supposed to be there, along with minimalist amounts of furnishings.This works on a few levels. First, it is symbolic with the plot: breaking barriers to the human condition, seeing people for who, and what, they really are. Second, the lack of walls shows audiences the true talents of the actor. Indeed, the actor must employ imagination and true feeling in order to be engrossed in the plot and their character's condition, rather than fixed on the lack of props.On that note, Nicole Kidman, as well as the other actors, did a stellar job in her character study. Once you are engaged in her performance, the no-walled set seems to not matter anymore, while you are more focused on the characters and what is happening in Dogville.I would also have to say that 'Dogville' is a film not to be taken lightly. It is definitely one of those films to think about, and that can be proposed as an allegory to modern society. Can people really help themselves? Should the wronged forgive? What can one person to in this world to simply survive? This film also questions moral judgement, as well as questioning how far is too far.The film has a startlingly unpredictable ending, but one that I found rather satisfying considering all that had happened in the preceding three hours.

Lars ""von"" Trier didn't get the nickname ""von"" from building model planes.  The guy's buddies in college just couldn't get over his resemblance to certain bad-guys from old World War II movies.What's horrifying about this monstrosity is how few people understand that this is pure, unrefined hate.  Apparently, most folks just believe that Nazi's were about antisemitism and jazzy uniforms.  Well, no.  Adolf Hitler could have written this.  ""Mein Kampf"" and ""Dogville"" have the same plot.  A young person is ruthlessly exploited, but then turns on her(his) exploiters and has revenge.I don't believe in censorship, but this movie should be required, by law, to have a warning label.  The label should explain, in detail, what a National Socialist is and what it means to exploit revenge and hatred and rage.  This movie should be shown to a wide audience, but only to educate them about the nature of the enemy, and how easy it is to be pulled-in by the appeal to raw emotion.Make no mistake-- this film is propaganda.  The sequel (Manderlay) is just as bad (but emphasizes the racism that always a part of Nazi ideology).  See them both for an education in evil.So... if you're wondering why this film hasn't been despised for what it is... just read the newspapers and watch FOX News and think for moment.

A young woman (Nicole Kidman) running from gangsters seeks refuge in a small mountain town during the Depression, where she is enslaved and brutalized by the inhabitants.  Von Trier appears to believe that Americans are uniquely violent, unfriendly, and racist.  Not only is the film set in the United States, but his decision to film it on a soundstage with outlines marked on the floor to represent the buildings and to use an omniscient narrator to comment on the action are reminiscent of ""Our Town,"" a play which is widely recognized as a slice of small-town Americana.  In case there are still any lingering doubts that von Trier intended this as a comment on human nature in general that just happens to be set in the US, at the end he treats us to a montage of photographs that show extreme poverty, ignorance, and cruelty while David Bowie sings ""Young Americans"" on the soundtrack.Of course, von Trier has a right to express his opinions about the US, even if he had never been here when he made his film.  America makes a lot of noise on the world stage and pretty much forces everyone to have an opinion about it.  However, even trying to look past my distaste with his message, I don't think it's a very successful film.  The running time is far too long and there seems to be a sadistic impulse toward the characters that is off-putting.  It benefits, however, from a truly extraordinary cast.

828706,AVCRD98TH48RN,B00029QXAK,D. Knouse,"[6, 8]","3.5 stars.  The most noticable difference about this film as compared to most others is that the entire film is shot on one huge soundstage, chalk outlines on the ground showing where the walls of homes are and the names of each residence, making this feel like a PBS special with nudity and sexual situations.  It looks and feels like a play, with each character bringing specific attitudes and motivations.  The cast is actually exceptional, with many memorable performances giving way to unsettling scenes ranging from reluctant acceptance to taking unseemly liberties with Grace (Nicole Kidman) without any fear of repercussion from the rest of the townsfolk by way of an insane communal understanding.  Grace is a character who enters the town of Dogville on the run from gangsters for mysterious reasons and is convinced by the resident philosopher to try and fit in with the people until things have died down.  She agrees reluctantly, but as the film progresses she grows to appreciate small town life away from crime and her former life in the big city and is gradually accepted into the fold of the community.  Then things start to change as the residents begin to show their true colors, that human nature is the same no matter where you find it, and they start to take advantage of Grace's situation.  The requests start off small, then build and build until she is under the proverbial ""thumb"" of the town.  She fears and loathes returning to her fomer life so much that she submits to all sorts of humiliation until finally she is nearly an empty shell of a woman.  Without hope or fear left, people from her past come to Dogville to find her broken in spirit but now cast in iron and able to survive and do anything without fear.  There is a lot of philosophical depth to the piece, and to be honest this story would work much better on the stage than it does on film.  Within the first half hour of the film I was convinced that the title of my review was going to be ""Snore.""  But as the ""chapters"" are revealed, the metaphors become more evident, Dogville itself looks more and more like an asylum with only the rare individual being anywhere near sane.  Eventually, Grace is given the choice of becoming a part of the madness or creating her own.  There are many scenes near the end of the film which are very provocative, but early on this film is so unusual as to seem a chore to watch.  Once the characters are established and once the viewer gets used to the idea of watching a filmed play instead of a movie, only then does the story become interesting.  There are a couple of negatives that become grating at times.  One was the voice-over narration that pops in for explanations and/or direction for what characters are thinking or going to do.  I would rather the story showed the characters using dialogue and action to convey their motivations rather than having it all explained to me throughout the film.  The second thing I didn't like, and this goes for many films these days, is that I'm am getting sick of hand-held photography.  It looks amateurish, as if anybody could be filming, the camera shaking and completely unable to center an image.  This type of filming happened frequently enough for me to get a little exasperated.  ""Enough!""  However, there is some interesting material here.  Is it enough to recommend the film?  Well, it really depends on how open-minded and cultured the viewers are.  If you enjoy a good play with strange characters and good acting in unusual situations, then yes, I recommend this film.

828707,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B00029QXAK,Dogville,"[4, 7]","Having watched Dancer In The Dark which left me emotionally cold and visibly affected, I expected no less from Dogville. One big difference between Dancer and Dogville is that the latter features just a stage set; no outdoor scenes. The story happens on a cludeo boardgame-like setup with well-demarcated lines and labelled areas that represent each charcter's dwelling place, roads and landmarks etc. The emphasis therefore falls on the actors' acting and good acting you will find here.Nicole Kidman's character stumbled into Dogville following some mobster's chase. A man, by the name of Tom, sheltered Grace, cared and fell for her. Tom tried to get the townsfolk to let Gracestay, so she began to help out with the residents on a daily basis for a small sum of money in order to gain their acceptance.However, things take a turn for the worse when wanted posters of Grace were put up in Dogville. The residents made more demands of Grace and the men made more advances. Her escape plan fell off tangent, but Dogville made a costly mistake.Nicole's acting is consummate. You can witness her emotions rollercoaster to great heights and lows and even the supporting cast gave great performances. The film was accussed of being anti-American and may have cost its chances at the Oscars but director Lars Von Trier should not be bothered for he has crafted yet another masterpiece, the first of a trilogy with the second, Manderlay to be out in 2005.This film is utimately about human flaws and vulnerability; the human nature of taking advantage of the disadvantaged and also the strength to survive. Nicole plays the role of God trying to help mankind realize their good but wrongdoings must also be punished for.A masterpiece!",5,Dogged Human,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,1729,"['Having', 'watched', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'left', 'emotionally', 'cold', 'visibly', 'affected', 'expected', 'less', 'Dogville', 'One', 'big', 'difference', 'Dancer', 'Dogville', 'latter', 'features', 'just', 'stage', 'set', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'story', 'cludeo', 'boardgame-like', 'setup', 'well-demarcated', 'lines', 'labelled', 'areas', 'represent', 'charcter', 'dwelling', 'place', 'roads', 'landmarks', 'etc', 'emphasis', 'therefore', 'actors', 'acting', 'good', 'acting', 'will', 'find', 'here.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'stumbled', 'Dogville', 'following', 'mobster', 'chase', 'man', 'name', 'Tom', 'sheltered', 'Grace', 'cared', 'fell', 'Tom', 'tried', 'get', 'townsfolk', 'let', 'Gracestay', 'began', 'help', 'out', 'residents', 'daily', 'basis', 'small', 'sum', 'money', 'order', 'gain', 'acceptance.However', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'wanted', 'posters', 'Grace', 'were', 'put', 'up', 'Dogville', 'residents', 'made', 'more', 'demands', 'Grace', 'men', 'made', 'more', 'advances', 'escape', 'plan', 'fell', 'off', 'tangent', 'Dogville', 'made', 'costly', 'mistake.Nicole', 'acting', 'consummate', 'can', 'witness', 'emotions', 'rollercoaster', 'great', 'heights', 'lows', 'even', 'supporting', 'cast', 'gave', 'great', 'performances', 'film', 'was', 'accussed', 'being', 'anti-American', 'may', 'have', 'cost', 'chances', 'Oscars', 'director', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'crafted', 'yet', 'masterpiece', 'first', 'trilogy', 'second', 'Manderlay', 'be', 'out', '2005.This', 'film', 'utimately', 'human', 'flaws', 'vulnerability', 'human', 'nature', 'taking', 'advantage', 'disadvantaged', 'also', 'strength', 'survive', 'Nicole', 'role', 'God', 'trying', 'help', 'mankind', 'realize', 'good', 'wrongdoings', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'punished', 'for.A', 'masterpiece']",N/A

828709,A2UBWDZF1HDXFZ,B00029QXAK,Douglas M. May,"[15, 21]","This film is unlike any other, including any other by Von Trier.  It is deeply flawed in execution but, at the same time, exhilaratingly fresh in inspiration.  I watched it for the first time last night and wasn't bored for a single minute.  Any film that so obviously concerns itself with exploring ideas and which, at the same time, manages to be so entertaining has to command respect.At the same time, I am convinced that at heart this film has no meaning-or that it has so many contradictory meanings that they effectively cancel each other out.  Is it an allegory of the Last Judgment?  Only if you believe that God is an implacable mobster bent on sadistic sport and Jesus his spiteful emissary-in other words, fallen sinners.  How about a socialist screed revolving around the class struggle?  Only if you're willing to ignore the fact that most of the exploiters are themselves exploited proletarians and that the major character's victimization is often more emotional than material.Perhaps the film works best as a conservative critique of classical liberalism, with its final insistence on personal responsibility and its insistence on the ""arrogance"" of forgiveness, when forgiveness implies the moral superiority of she or he who forgives and the inherent inferiority of the parties requiring forgiveness.The problem I have with the film is not with its multiplicity of possible interpretations.  It lies in the director's constant confusion of the moral and aesthetic dimensions.  In a film that is so obviously concerned with the human capacity for choosing good or evil, it is disconcerting to say the least to constantly be pulled in the direction of the aesthetic.  And make no mistake, this film is an aesthetic triumph.  The set is beautiful.  The most casual effects, such as the fine dusting of snow or the light appearing through the clouds at the end of the film, achieve visual sublimity occurring as they do in such an austere setting.  The compositions are rigorous and exacting as those encountered in Giacometti's metaphysical palaces and consistently arrest the eye with unimpeded vanishing points and breathtaking arrangements of artfully chosen visual props.  But what does any of this have to do with either/or?The actors make a brave attempt to cast off their instincts and training to become like Bresson models, so that Von Trier can achieve his Brechtian alienation strategy.  Mostly they succeed.  Nicole is magnificent, as good as Emily Watson in ""Breaking the Waves"" and that's really saying something.Finally, if anyone thinks this film isn't about the good old USA, they didn't stay until the final credits.  The choice of images from the Depression, spiraling downward to racist atrocities in the 60's, was another deliberate aesthetic choice by the director-one of many quixotic choices that will have people discussing this movie for years to come.",3,Completely sui generis....,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,2894,"['film', 'other', 'including', 'other', 'Von', 'Trier', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'execution', 'same', 'time', 'exhilaratingly', 'fresh', 'inspiration', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'single', 'minute', 'Any', 'film', 'so', 'obviously', 'concerns', 'exploring', 'ideas', 'same', 'time', 'be', 'so', 'entertaining', 'command', 'respect.At', 'same', 'time', 'am', 'convinced', 'heart', 'film', 'meaning-or', 'so', 'many', 'contradictory', 'meanings', 'effectively', 'cancel', 'other', 'out', 'allegory', 'Last', 'Judgment', 'Only', 'believe', 'God', 'implacable', 'mobster', 'bent', 'sadistic', 'sport', 'Jesus', 'spiteful', 'emissary-in', 'other', 'words', 'fallen', 'sinners', 'How', 'socialist', 'screed', 'revolving', 'class', 'struggle', 'Only', ""'re"", 'willing', 'ignore', 'fact', 'most', 'exploiters', 'are', 'exploited', 'proletarians', 'major', 'character', 'victimization', 'often', 'more', 'emotional', 'film', 'best', 'conservative', 'critique', 'classical', 'liberalism', 'final', 'insistence', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'insistence', 'arrogance', 'forgiveness', 'when', 'forgiveness', 'moral', 'superiority', 'who', 'inherent', 'inferiority', 'parties', 'requiring', 'forgiveness.The', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'not', 'multiplicity', 'possible', 'interpretations', 'director', 'constant', 'confusion', 'moral', 'aesthetic', 'dimensions', 'film', 'so', 'obviously', 'concerned', 'human', 'capacity', 'choosing', 'good', 'evil', 'disconcerting', 'say', 'least', 'constantly', 'be', 'pulled', 'direction', 'aesthetic', 'make', 'mistake', 'film', 'aesthetic', 'triumph', 'set', 'beautiful', 'most', 'casual', 'effects', 'such', 'fine', 'dusting', 'snow', 'light', 'appearing', 'clouds', 'end', 'film', 'achieve', 'visual', 'sublimity', 'occurring', 'do', 'austere', 'setting', 'compositions', 'are', 'rigorous', 'exacting', 'encountered', 'Giacometti', 'metaphysical', 'palaces', 'consistently', 'arrest', 'eye', 'unimpeded', 'vanishing', 'points', 'breathtaking', 'arrangements', 'artfully', 'chosen', 'visual', 'props', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'either/or', 'actors', 'make', 'brave', 'attempt', 'cast', 'off', 'instincts', 'training', 'become', 'Bresson', 'models', 'Von', 'Trier', 'can', 'achieve', 'Brechtian', 'alienation', 'strategy', 'Mostly', 'succeed', 'Nicole', 'magnificent', 'as', 'good', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'really', 'saying', 'something.Finally', 'anyone', 'film', ""n't"", 'good', 'old', 'USA', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'final', 'credits', 'choice', 'images', 'Depression', 'spiraling', 'downward', 'racist', 'atrocities', '60', 'was', 'deliberate', 'aesthetic', 'choice', 'director-one', 'many', 'quixotic', 'choices', 'will', 'have', 'people', 'discussing', 'movie', 'years', 'come']",N/A

The DVD I had only had the one disc.If you're looking for the big-budget movies Nicole is usually in, look elsewhere.. this is the type of movie that winds up on Sundance Channel and IFC, and as far as I know, only played the art houses...The draw to this film is Nicole Kidman, but the overall cast is top-rate, legends and current actors alike.The entire film is presented in a play format, on a stage, over a 3 hour period, with 7 chapters and a narrator.In a way, it reminded me of old clips I've seen of ""GE Theater"" or ""Hallmark"" teleplays from the 1950s, when they used to televise plays on soundstages.To summarize, a mysterious girl named Grace (definitely representative of her nature) runs into small town hiding from something, a town of 20-something people in the 30s. The people seem friendly and Grace tries to point out the positives, but the Dog ""bears its teeth"" soon enough and Grace is attacked by the town in different ways. (Bjork had mentioned that von Trier's a ""stealer of women's souls"" when they made ""Dancer in the Dark"")Eventually we find out what Grace was running from and there's no mistaking why James Caan is in it.It ends somewhat shocking.If I was to describe it, it is part ""Ironweed"", part ""Our Town"" part ""Threepenny Opera"" (without the singing) part ""The Lottery"".I wouldn't say the tone was ""anti-American"" though. ""anti-arrogance"" maybe... I think von Trier in calling the trilogy ""America-Land of Opportunity"" might give some hints into what he's actually trying to say through the films.I had thought of a film called ""Maria Full of Grace"" which in a way could be a ""Dogville"" of sorts, in Columbia.Any country could have their own ""Dogville"", and putting it in the Depression era at a time when things were truly bleak for many people.

But, in the end, I was glad I stayed with it notwithstanding the deeply disturbing plot.  [WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD.]  As the entire town by turns betrays and exploits the female fugitive who throws herself on its mercy, all the while justifying its actions with copious doses of self-righteous rationalization, one detects notes of abusive regimes from nazism to slavery.  But the most disturbing part about it to me was that, by the time the tables are turned and the victim makes her choice between forgiveness and revenge, I didn't want her to show forgiveness.  And even though her retribution was totally heartless, even sadistic, at some level it was satisfying.  Thus one is given insights into one's own potential for vindictiveness, and perhaps into the reason that human societies are burdened with bitter, centuries-old enmities that show no hope of being resolved.  In sum the film was a depressing but worthwhile effort.  The one thing that didn't really work for me were the depression-era photos shown with the credits, because while that was a sad and grim era in our country's history, the malign and cowardly behavior of the characters here reminded me more of the shameful way American citizens behaved toward the Japanese-Americans during WWII or towards suspected communists during or during the cold war.",4,Very dark,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,1422,"['took', 'get', 'film', 'grim', 'thesis', 'theatrical', 'style', 'stark', 'sets', 'end', 'was', 'glad', 'stayed', 'notwithstanding', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'plot', '[', 'WARNING', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'entire', 'town', 'turns', 'betrays', 'female', 'fugitive', 'who', 'mercy', 'while', 'justifying', 'actions', 'copious', 'doses', 'self-righteous', 'rationalization', 'one', 'notes', 'abusive', 'regimes', 'nazism', 'slavery', 'most', 'disturbing', 'part', 'was', 'time', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'victim', 'choice', 'forgiveness', 'revenge', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'show', 'forgiveness', 'even', 'retribution', 'was', 'totally', 'heartless', 'even', 'sadistic', 'level', 'was', 'satisfying', 'Thus', 'one', 'given', 'insights', 'one', 'own', 'potential', 'vindictiveness', 'perhaps', 'reason', 'human', 'societies', 'are', 'burdened', 'bitter', 'centuries-old', 'enmities', 'show', 'hope', 'being', 'resolved', 'sum', 'film', 'was', 'depressing', 'worthwhile', 'effort', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'were', 'depression-era', 'photos', 'shown', 'credits', 'was', 'sad', 'grim', 'era', 'country', 'history', 'malign', 'cowardly', 'behavior', 'characters', 'here', 'reminded', 'more', 'shameful', 'way', 'American', 'citizens', 'behaved', 'Japanese-Americans', 'WWII', 'towards', 'suspected', 'communists', 'cold', 'war']",N/A

Would you be touched and inspired to emulate her when she turned the other cheek, or would her failure to defend herself from the unscrupulous gradually earn your contempt?  Would you take her gifts, use her, persecute her, and eventually join the mob baying to the authorities for her blood?This is the implicit question posed to every viewer by director von Trier in this brilliant allegory, excruciating (no pun intended) to watch, but so mesmerizing that I couldn't look away. Here you'll find no fancy special effects, no gorgeous period sets, just a wall-less chalked-out stage to represent a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business and an outstanding ensemble of actors who bring it to life, ultimately in horrifying detail.It's no coincidence that the movie ends with Depression-era footage and a particular David Bowie song in the background, but von Trier's intent is not simple America-bashing. Under the right circumstances, the sort of transformation depicted so extremely here could happen anywhere that the Other is regarded with suspicion and fear, where need and/or greed outweigh empathy and persuade us to regard our fellow human beings as commodities, where legally and socially vulnerable individuals depend on the kindness of strangers (or even friends) and are powerless to oppose their own ill treatment.Think runaway slaves heading north but also Jews in Nazi Germany.

So understand that if you read on, I'm not responsible for blowing the ending.Ok, so I watched this movie in a political studies class at my university. At first, I hated.. HATED the minimalist set. I was thinking to myself, oh man, I hope the whole movie is not like this. I was waiting for buildings to start appearing one by one. Nope. Not happening. The whole movie looks like a high school play production. I was fuming about that for quite a while. To me, when I watch a movie, I pay attention to the set, because it provides a lot of context for the movie. It really helps set the scene, which is why it's called the SET. Take that away, and sometimes it just looks silly, like when actors are trying to turn invisible doorknobs on doors that are plainly not there.Then the plot started picking up, and I was able to forget about the lack of a proper set. The main character of the story, Grace, tries to fit in to a small town, works hard for all the townspeople, and in return she is taken advantage of by everyone in the town. It starts with petty jealousy, then overwork, then she is threatened, has her belongings smashed, her money stolen, then rape, then she's chained up and raped repeatedly by just about every male in the town. She tries to to escape and is betrayed. When the townspeople call in her gangster father, hoping for a reward, she settles her differences with her father and uses his power. I was afraid for a minute she was going to cower away, leaving the townspeople unpunished. Instead, she orders her father's gangsters to set fire to the town and shoot every man, woman and child with their tommy guns. At that point I was laughing and clapping my hands, as was everyone else in my class. Then she corrects the gangsters to ""shoot the kids in front of the mother, then shoot her."" HA! I wanted to give Grace a high five at that point.Later on, I remembered that I had always wondered what could have possessed German troops in WWII to liquidate entire villages in Eastern Europe, and here I was laughing and clapping at images of it happening here in the USA. But Grace had been so wronged, for so long, in so many ways, and those townspeople were so irredeemably wicked, they deserved exactly what they got. I think that is one of the lessons of this movie, that if properly motivated, any person, anywhere is capable of deadly actions.As for accusations that this is anti-American, I don't think so. It was set in the USA, but it could have happened anywhere. I didn't perceive anything that made this situation as a commentary on American culture, but on humanity in general. And I'm a dedicated Republican saying this. Usually I am sensitive to anti-American propaganda in movies and on tv, but I think this movie's criticisms go beyond just the United States.",4,WARNING this whole review is one big SPOILER,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,2932,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'STOP', 'READING', 'NOW', 'real', 'movie', 'best', 'surprise', 'ending', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'So', 'understand', 'read', ""'m"", 'not', 'responsible', 'blowing', 'ending.Ok', 'watched', 'movie', 'political', 'studies', 'class', 'university', 'first', 'hated..', 'minimalist', 'set', 'was', 'thinking', 'oh', 'man', 'hope', 'whole', 'movie', 'not', 'was', 'waiting', 'buildings', 'start', 'appearing', 'one', 'one', 'Nope', 'Not', 'happening', 'whole', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'production', 'was', 'fuming', 'quite', 'while', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'pay', 'attention', 'set', 'lot', 'context', 'movie', 'really', 'set', 'scene', 'why', 'called', 'SET', 'Take', 'away', 'just', 'silly', 'when', 'actors', 'are', 'trying', 'turn', 'invisible', 'doorknobs', 'doors', 'are', 'plainly', 'not', 'there.Then', 'plot', 'started', 'picking', 'up', 'was', 'able', 'forget', 'lack', 'proper', 'set', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'Grace', 'fit', 'small', 'town', 'hard', 'townspeople', 'return', 'taken', 'advantage', 'everyone', 'town', 'petty', 'jealousy', 'then', 'overwork', 'then', 'threatened', 'belongings', 'smashed', 'money', 'stolen', 'then', 'rape', 'then', 'chained', 'up', 'raped', 'repeatedly', 'just', 'male', 'town', 'escape', 'betrayed', 'When', 'townspeople', 'call', 'gangster', 'father', 'hoping', 'reward', 'differences', 'father', 'power', 'was', 'afraid', 'minute', 'was', 'going', 'cower', 'away', 'leaving', 'townspeople', 'unpunished', 'Instead', 'orders', 'father', 'gangsters', 'set', 'fire', 'town', 'shoot', 'man', 'woman', 'child', 'tommy', 'guns', 'point', 'was', 'laughing', 'clapping', 'hands', 'was', 'everyone', 'else', 'class', 'Then', 'gangsters', 'shoot', 'kids', 'front', 'mother', 'then', 'HA', 'wanted', 'give', 'Grace', 'high', 'five', 'point.Later', 'remembered', 'had', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'possessed', 'German', 'troops', 'WWII', 'liquidate', 'entire', 'villages', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'here', 'was', 'laughing', 'clapping', 'images', 'happening', 'here', 'USA', 'Grace', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'wronged', 'so', 'long', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'townspeople', 'were', 'so', 'irredeemably', 'wicked', 'deserved', 'exactly', 'what', 'got', 'think', 'one', 'lessons', 'movie', 'properly', 'motivated', 'person', 'capable', 'deadly', 'actions.As', 'accusations', 'anti-American', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'was', 'set', 'USA', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'anywhere', 'did', ""n't"", 'perceive', 'anything', 'made', 'situation', 'commentary', 'American', 'culture', 'humanity', 'general', ""'m"", 'dedicated', 'Republican', 'saying', 'Usually', 'am', 'sensitive', 'anti-American', 'propaganda', 'movies', 'tv', 'think', 'movie', 'criticisms', 'go', 'just', 'United', 'States']",N/A
828718,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B00029QXAK,Erica Anderson,"[2, 4]","I finally got the opportunity to see ""Dogville"" today. I have been wanting to see it for some time now. I am not really a big Nicole Kidman fan but I do think she is a good actress to say the very least. I just never been really into some of her films (didn't like ""Moulin Rouge"" but loved ""The Others"", ""Dead Calm"", ""The Hours""). I can now add ""Dogville"" to my brief list of films that I enjoyed her in. ""Dogville"" simply took my breath away. This was a film that solely relied on the actors and their performances than on the settings and scenery. Director Lars Von Trier picked a stunning cast of actors to play the entire town of Dogville. It took me awhile to recognize Patricia Clarkson (of ""The Station Agent"") as Vera, the wife of the local apple orchard man. The story revolves around Dogville and its residents when Grace (Nicole Kidman) enters the town and is befriended by Tom (Paul Bettany). The residents are at first reluctant to allow Grace to reside in their small, desolate town but eventually they decide to give her two weeks to prove herself. Everything starts off on the right foot for Grace but eventually the towns people begins to show their true colors when missing/wanted posters of Grace are hung up, and it isn't a pretty sight. Despite the lengthiness of the film, I was engaged in the film completely. This was my first Lars Von Trier film I have seen so I can't really compare ""Dogville"" to any of his other movies. If I thought ""Mystic River"" and ""21 Grams"" were dark films, ""Dogville"" would make them look like an Adam Sandler movie. I thought ""Dogville"" was a very compelling look into the dark side of human nature and how manipulative and cruel we as an entire race can be towards our fellow human being. I also liked the feel of the film. It felt like watching a play in a movie theater. In some bizarre way, ""Dogville"" was a messed up version of ""Our Town"". Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, and the rest of the cast put in excellent performances.

This and almost every other Trier film (minus his first few) are essentially exercises in style (or deliberate lack thereof) over substance. Plot isn't really the point, writing is definitely not the point, acting is not even the point (although the actors do try). The point, at least from Triers' perspective is a grandiose, delusional updraft of self worth that (in his mind) makes his esoteric manner of filmmaking more perfect than everything that came before it. I believe the idiom is &#34;hot air&#34;.Triers revels in being &#34;provocative&#34; - but provocation without reason is simply the act of being annoying, and that seems to basically define Triers' self-made genre. I am sure he secretly considers himself the cinematic equivalent of Andy Warhol - an artist's who's statement and philosophy is deliberately more considered than the work it describes. The big difference between a revolutionary like Warhol and a wannabe revolutionary like Triers is that for Warhol the joke was on us - everybody else.

828724,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,B00029QXAK,Furiae,"[30, 46]","I had already typed up a review detailing the flaws in the movies central themes.  I set out to defy Lars von Trier's message and commentary on kindness, but I decided to leave the philosophizing out.  Suffice to say I found the themes and messages of this movie cynical and pretentious.Speaking of pretention, however, many people have labeled this work anti-American.  I can't say I agree, but I do see how and why that accusation comes about.  As Roger Ebert put it, ""His dislike of the United States (which he has never visited, since he is afraid of airplanes) is so palpable that it flies beyond criticism into the realm of derangement... Von Trier could justifiably make a fantasy about America, even an anti-American fantasy, and produce a good film, but here he approaches the ideological subtlety of a raving prophet on a street corner.""  I couldn't agree more.  While watching the movie, I didn't feel the 'sense' or 'spirit' of the United States.  I've felt this many times, being Chinese-American, while watching American movies that touched on Asian subjects--the 'feel' and 'spirit' of the subject matter was never tapped into because it's something unfamiliar to the film's makers.  To tell you the truth, the overall vibe I got from the movie was more European than anything else.Lars von Trier has gone on record saying that he didn't feel his never visiting America would hamper his making a movie about America.  In my opinion, that's like saying I could make a film about Native Americans and portray them faithfully without ever spending any time on a reservation with a tribe.  I guess there's just a huge difference between wishing to portray something ""successfully"" versus wishing to portray them ""faithfully.""Von Trier doesn't fail in this movie--he makes an original piece that is unique, though quite a bit too long for my taste.  The actors' give stellar performances given the framework they had to work within.Some say the film is anti-American, but I say it's un-American.  Down to the ambiance and unconscious subtleties, von Trier doesn't possess the grasp of Americana it takes to make a film set in a believable America about believable Americans.  The lack of believable, realistic nuances that surround American life make this film a bit odd (okay, very odd).  What nuances and subtleties I felt while watching this film felt more, like I said, European in nature than American.Lastly, this piece is rather pretentious.  It seemed to have been made to convey a message more than anything else.  There are little props, the characters play second fiddle to their dialogue, and realism is all thrown out the door.  Unfortunately, the concepts are conceited and the ideology and philosophies are dry.  I'm not saying that the stage set-up wasn't realistic--I understand it's not meant to be realistic--I'm saying the overall nuances are not realistic.I try to be open-minded, and indeed, I usually am the one in my family who enjoys films my relatives would consider too off-the-wall.  However, I couldn't help but feel all the 'ideologies' presented in this film came from a friend of my younger brother's: an adolescent boy who has too much time to waste (but thinks his life is oh-so-full-of-woe) whose philosophies are always on the conceited, cynical side and would do well to get out into the real world and get a reality check.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that boy spouted support of some of this movie's themes.

When the residents find out that she may be wanted by the law for the bank robberies, they demand more of her services and eventually make her their slave. Friendly and honest people turn into the sadistic monsters indulging their vile instincts and enjoying the strongest drug possible - absolute power over a helpless human being.Dodgeville's visual style comes directly from the 50th TV dramas - minimum decorations, just a few actors, and a lot of text. There are no real houses or mountains on the screen - the main street, the benches, the bushes, the houses of the residents are marked out with a chalk outlines on the stage. We see some chairs, beds, and desks. There are no walls or doors to cover what happens behind them - all is opened for us to see. Director's craft is fantastic - you soon forget unreality of the sets - impressiveness of close-ups, usage of light and different angles are fantastic. Several film's images should be studied in the film schools. One of them is the shot of Grace trying escape Dogville and hiding in the truck full of apples. She thinks she is covered and safe and nobody could see her...Another - shot when the light lit her face and it radiates in a gentle gold - brings to memory the famous candle lit scenes from Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. The actors are all amazing and they are another reason to forget about the unconventional set. Nicole Kidman played the best role of her career and I have to admit that waiting for so long to see her in this performance was worth it.With all this said I couldn't accept Lars von Trier's ""Dogville"" as his masterpiece. He may be a genius but an evil genius. He is a cold and calculating master of provocations. Each frame of Dogville is a masterpiece and I am ready to admire and applaud to every one of them. Unfortunately, put together they contain nothing but misanthropy, hatred and contempt for all humans with only one exception - Mr. Von Trier himself. I kept asking myself while watching Dogville why he hates us? Not just the town folks of Dogville and not only America but the whole human race. What is it, genuine pain or the evil laugh in which we hear that we all deserve our Hell?Von Trier is a brilliant director, ""Dogville"" is a phenomenal film but I just cannot agree with his depiction of all residents. There were children (one of them just an innocent infant who could not be hold responsible for the sins of his parents) and a crippled, helpless girl.This is not the first von Trier's film I've seen. His ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"" are very difficult to watch. They, too, deal with humiliated and tortured innocence but there was hope in those two films. The heroines went through unthinkable trials and tribulations but there was light in the end, catharsis. There is no catharsis in ""Dogville"" - bitterness, hopelessness, despair, anger, and the question to the writer/director -who are you to judge? You are the one who came up with all these monsters in the first place.I understand the whole story is an allegory of power and how easily it turns seemingly decent people into monsters. As Lord Acton said ""Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely"" but I simply refuse to accept von Trier's message that the whole world MAY BE Dogville. I refuse to believe that an outsider in a desperate need of help will be treated by ALL with no exception members of a tight community in such way the citizens of Dogville treated Grace.Directing and acting - 5/5 ; message 1/5",3,Is the Whole World Dogville?,1177545600,"04 26, 2007",2007,3943,"['Beautiful', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'Grace', 'gangsters', 'tiny', 'town', 'Dogville', 'somewhere', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', 'first', 'man', 'Tom', 'Edison', 'Paul', 'Bethany', 'writer/philosopher', 'who', 'not', 'written', 'anything', 'yet', 'help', 'town', 'folks', 'Hard-working', 'decent', 'residents', 'Dogville', 'reluctantly', 'agree', 'let', 'Grace', 'stay', 'exchange', 'menial', 'services', 'When', 'residents', 'find', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'wanted', 'law', 'bank', 'robberies', 'demand', 'more', 'services', 'eventually', 'make', 'slave', 'Friendly', 'honest', 'people', 'turn', 'sadistic', 'monsters', 'indulging', 'vile', 'instincts', 'enjoying', 'strongest', 'drug', 'possible', 'absolute', 'power', 'helpless', 'human', 'being.Dodgeville', 'visual', 'style', 'directly', '50th', 'TV', 'dramas', 'minimum', 'decorations', 'just', 'few', 'actors', 'lot', 'text', 'are', 'real', 'houses', 'mountains', 'screen', 'main', 'street', 'benches', 'bushes', 'houses', 'residents', 'are', 'marked', 'out', 'chalk', 'stage', 'see', 'chairs', 'beds', 'desks', 'are', 'walls', 'doors', 'cover', 'what', 'opened', 'see', 'Director', 'craft', 'fantastic', 'soon', 'forget', 'unreality', 'sets', 'impressiveness', 'close-ups', 'usage', 'light', 'different', 'angles', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Several', 'film', 'images', 'should', 'be', 'studied', 'film', 'schools', 'One', 'shot', 'Grace', 'trying', 'escape', 'Dogville', 'hiding', 'truck', 'full', 'apples', 'covered', 'safe', 'nobody', 'could', 'see', 'shot', 'when', 'light', 'lit', 'face', 'gentle', 'gold', 'memory', 'famous', 'candle', 'lit', 'scenes', 'Kubrick', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'actors', 'are', 'amazing', 'are', 'reason', 'forget', 'unconventional', 'set', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'played', 'best', 'role', 'career', 'have', 'admit', 'waiting', 'so', 'long', 'see', 'performance', 'was', 'worth', 'it.With', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'accept', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Dogville', 'masterpiece', 'may', 'be', 'genius', 'evil', 'genius', 'cold', 'calculating', 'master', 'provocations', 'frame', 'Dogville', 'masterpiece', 'am', 'ready', 'admire', 'applaud', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'put', 'together', 'contain', 'nothing', 'misanthropy', 'hatred', 'contempt', 'humans', 'only', 'one', 'exception', 'Mr', 'Von', 'Trier', 'kept', 'asking', 'watching', 'Dogville', 'why', 'Not', 'just', 'town', 'folks', 'Dogville', 'not', 'only', 'America', 'whole', 'human', 'race', 'What', 'genuine', 'pain', 'evil', 'laugh', 'hear', 'deserve', 'Hell', 'Von', 'Trier', 'brilliant', 'director', 'Dogville', 'phenomenal', 'film', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'depiction', 'residents', 'were', 'children', 'one', 'just', 'innocent', 'infant', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'hold', 'responsible', 'sins', 'parents', 'crippled', 'helpless', 'girl.This', 'not', 'first', 'von', 'Trier', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'too', 'deal', 'humiliated', 'tortured', 'innocence', 'was', 'hope', 'two', 'films', 'heroines', 'went', 'unthinkable', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'was', 'light', 'end', 'catharsis', 'catharsis', 'Dogville', 'bitterness', 'hopelessness', 'despair', 'anger', 'question', 'writer/director', '-who', 'are', 'judge', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'monsters', 'first', 'place.I', 'understand', 'whole', 'story', 'allegory', 'power', 'how', 'easily', 'seemingly', 'decent', 'people', 'monsters', 'Lord', 'Acton', 'said', 'Power', 'corrupt', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely', 'simply', 'refuse', 'accept', 'von', 'Trier', 'message', 'whole', 'world', 'MAY', 'BE', 'Dogville', 'refuse', 'believe', 'outsider', 'desperate', 'need', 'help', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'ALL', 'exception', 'members', 'tight', 'community', 'such', 'way', 'citizens', 'Dogville', 'treated', 'Grace.Directing', 'acting', '5/5', 'message', '1/5']",N/A

828729,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00029QXAK,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[2, 9]","Lars Von Trier, the 47 old ditsy Danish director, once dubbed the enfant terrible, has placed in the mainstream of celluloid a movie that manages to be anti-film, even as it passes itself off as an artistic endeavor. Was this film a religious allegory, a morality play, or just the germ of an idea that aborted as it came to full term? Yes, came the thunderous reply, and more, and less. But one thing is abundantly clear,""Something is rotten in the State of Denmark."". Roger Ebert said of this film,"" Von Trier exhibits the imagination of an artist, but the pendantry of a crank."".The choice of a minimalist set, a sparse world for the word play, just so many fat chalk lines and a few assorted props, was far from innovative; rather it was enervative, actually sapping the vigor of the piece and reducing its vitality. Von Trier, a guiding force behind the Dogme Movement, feels that as an artist, it is his job to alienate, to shock, to outrage and to confuse his audience. Like Brecht, he seems hellbent on breaking the illusion that comes from developing feeling for a character. As a writer, he created dialogue that would drive an insomniac crashing into slumber, flat non-sequiturs that lethargically lead from one dead end thought to another.This film outraged me, but oddly, I also treasured the excruciating experience. I was witness to both a travesty and a pivotal form of greatness. Von Trier is so arrogant that he seems to believe that he needs to pummel down the conventions of film, and create a whole new form. But he works fitfully, like a mentally deranged amateur. Actually his premise is a workable one. I just felt that his hubris prevented him from creating something cohesive. His Dogme principles of natural lighting, poorly executed camera angles, and handheld jerky documentarian six o'clock news utilization of his camera, are all leagues short of successful composition or cinematic closure. He shot the film on a sound stage in Copenhagen. A stage, I'm certain that came equipped with state of the art cranes, stedi-cams, gyros, tracks, and mulitiple cameras. Why did he chose to disregard them?A Von Trier film is a virtual netherland of wandering zombies who demand our attention, but who resist our overtures for clarification of thought, plot, and action. His dialogue is flat, preachy, colorless and monotone gray. His actors are forced to mouth it like month-old bread; stale, dry, and tasteless.His cast was a powerhouse, albeit mostly wasted on the mundane material; a whirlwind blend of bankable stars that were willing to take chances for their art, and veteran stars that were just glad to get the work. Nicole Kidman, as Grace, the sacrificial lamb, was very effective. Her role will be memorable, more for its outrageousness than for its integral value or artistic merit. Many of her past performances outshine and eclipse this one. Paul Betteny was appropriately shallow, enigmatic, self-serving and hypocritical as young Tom Edison. Presented at first as a probable protagonist, he emerged quickly as a coward and opportunist. Stellan Skarsgard as Chuck, the cynic hiding in plain sight was very good. His sense of despair was clarion. John Hurt as the narrator who droned on in theatrical tones about the good people of Dogville, seemed to be chorus and godhead in one. I would have liked to have met him incarnate, interacting with the townsfolk, ala OUR TOWN. James Caan as the Big Man, the enforcer, was also very effective, effortless emulating his past roles, creating a solid presence with a minimum of effort. Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Blair Brown, Jeremy Davis, Zeljko Ivanek, and Philip Baker Hall, all were given little to do, so they responded in kind, making barely a ripple in the big pond. Patricia Clarkson was the exception. She was able to wrest an interesting performance from the lameness of the script. Most of the cast were satisfied with underachievement, and they became almost faceless fabric in the weave of the murmering mosaic of townsfolk.This film is worth the watch, if one has the energy, and three hours to spare.",3,Brecht's Dogpatch,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,4095,"['Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', '47', 'old', 'ditsy', 'Danish', 'director', 'once', 'dubbed', 'enfant', 'terrible', 'placed', 'mainstream', 'celluloid', 'movie', 'be', 'anti-film', 'even', 'off', 'artistic', 'endeavor', 'Was', 'film', 'religious', 'allegory', 'morality', 'play', 'just', 'germ', 'idea', 'aborted', 'came', 'full', 'term', 'Yes', 'came', 'thunderous', 'reply', 'more', 'less', 'one', 'thing', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'Something', 'rotten', 'State', 'Denmark.', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'said', 'film', 'Von', 'Trier', 'imagination', 'artist', 'pendantry', 'crank', '.The', 'choice', 'minimalist', 'set', 'sparse', 'world', 'word', 'play', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'fat', 'chalk', 'lines', 'few', 'assorted', 'props', 'was', 'far', 'innovative', 'rather', 'was', 'enervative', 'actually', 'sapping', 'vigor', 'piece', 'reducing', 'vitality', 'Von', 'Trier', 'guiding', 'force', 'Dogme', 'Movement', 'artist', 'job', 'alienate', 'shock', 'outrage', 'confuse', 'audience', 'Brecht', 'hellbent', 'breaking', 'illusion', 'developing', 'feeling', 'character', 'writer', 'created', 'dialogue', 'would', 'drive', 'insomniac', 'crashing', 'slumber', 'flat', 'non-sequiturs', 'lethargically', 'lead', 'one', 'dead', 'end', 'thought', 'another.This', 'film', 'oddly', 'also', 'treasured', 'excruciating', 'experience', 'was', 'witness', 'travesty', 'pivotal', 'form', 'greatness', 'Von', 'Trier', 'so', 'arrogant', 'believe', 'pummel', 'down', 'conventions', 'film', 'create', 'whole', 'new', 'form', 'fitfully', 'mentally', 'deranged', 'amateur', 'Actually', 'premise', 'workable', 'one', 'just', 'felt', 'hubris', 'prevented', 'creating', 'something', 'cohesive', 'Dogme', 'principles', 'natural', 'lighting', 'poorly', 'executed', 'camera', 'angles', 'handheld', 'jerky', 'documentarian', 'six', ""o'clock"", 'news', 'utilization', 'camera', 'are', 'leagues', 'short', 'successful', 'composition', 'cinematic', 'closure', 'shot', 'film', 'sound', 'stage', 'Copenhagen', 'stage', ""'m"", 'certain', 'came', 'equipped', 'state', 'art', 'cranes', 'stedi-cams', 'gyros', 'tracks', 'mulitiple', 'cameras', 'Why', 'did', 'chose', 'disregard', 'Von', 'Trier', 'film', 'virtual', 'netherland', 'wandering', 'zombies', 'who', 'demand', 'attention', 'who', 'resist', 'overtures', 'clarification', 'thought', 'plot', 'action', 'dialogue', 'flat', 'preachy', 'colorless', 'monotone', 'gray', 'actors', 'are', 'forced', 'mouth', 'month-old', 'bread', 'stale', 'dry', 'tasteless.His', 'cast', 'was', 'powerhouse', 'albeit', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'mundane', 'material', 'whirlwind', 'blend', 'bankable', 'stars', 'were', 'willing', 'take', 'chances', 'art', 'veteran', 'stars', 'were', 'just', 'glad', 'get', 'work', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Grace', 'sacrificial', 'lamb', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'role', 'will', 'be', 'memorable', 'more', 'outrageousness', 'integral', 'value', 'artistic', 'merit', 'Many', 'past', 'performances', 'outshine', 'eclipse', 'one', 'Paul', 'Betteny', 'was', 'appropriately', 'shallow', 'enigmatic', 'self-serving', 'hypocritical', 'young', 'Tom', 'Edison', 'Presented', 'first', 'probable', 'protagonist', 'emerged', 'quickly', 'coward', 'opportunist', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Chuck', 'cynic', 'hiding', 'plain', 'sight', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'sense', 'despair', 'was', 'clarion', 'John', 'Hurt', 'narrator', 'who', 'droned', 'theatrical', 'tones', 'good', 'people', 'Dogville', 'seemed', 'be', 'chorus', 'godhead', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'met', 'incarnate', 'interacting', 'townsfolk', 'ala', 'OUR', 'TOWN', 'James', 'Caan', 'Big', 'Man', 'enforcer', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'effortless', 'emulating', 'past', 'roles', 'creating', 'solid', 'presence', 'minimum', 'effort', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'Jeremy', 'Davis', 'Zeljko', 'Ivanek', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'were', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'responded', 'kind', 'making', 'barely', 'ripple', 'big', 'pond', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'was', 'exception', 'was', 'able', 'wrest', 'interesting', 'performance', 'lameness', 'script', 'Most', 'cast', 'were', 'satisfied', 'underachievement', 'became', 'almost', 'faceless', 'fabric', 'weave', 'murmering', 'mosaic', 'townsfolk.This', 'film', 'watch', 'one', 'energy', 'three', 'hours', 'spare']",N/A

Writer Director Lars von Trier once again has dared to pry open the truths concealed by conventional facades to examine the human condition, the plight of human survival in a world populated by intimidated individuals who only define their public identity by affiliating/identifying with the Norm.  In so many ways this story with a Prologue and Nine Chapters is a morality play ad as such it is piercingly poignant and superbly constructed.  This film is a minimalist film: the 'sets' are diagrammed lines on the floor, the props are spare, the action all taking lace on a sound stage that appears like a Joseph Cornell box.The Depression Years in America, a time of gangsters, poverty and minimal communication of world events to the tiny towns on the Midwest. Dogville is a rural small town in the Midwest peopled by what appear to be good folk.  Into this scene enters a beautiful girl on the run Grace (a luminous Nicole Kidman) who seems to be in flight from gangsters.  The town's philosopher Tom (Paul Bettany in an extraordinary performance) finds Grace, hides her in the town's mineshaft (over the door is the inscription 'Speak the Truth'...), and convinces the townsfolk to harbor her.  In exchange for this kindness Grace must do some work for each of them everyday as a gesture of good will.  When the police come looking for Grace later, the townsfolk still protect her but the price is doubling the amount of work she must do in reparation. Slowly this town of kind appearing folk become wary of Grace, start lies about her, abuse her sexually and physically, and eventually fetter her as their prisoner. Tom advises her to address the townsfolk with the whole truth of how the individuals in the town, quite apart form acting as a group,  have been secretly treating her: the truth will make you free sort of confession.  From that point the story turns and the ending is so very powerful that even hinting at the last chapter would rob the audience of the incredible impact.von Trier has gathered a cast of brilliant actors: in addition to Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany, the cast includes Patricia Clarkson, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Skarsgard, Chloe Sevigny, Harriet Andersson, James Caan, Phil Baker Hall, Jeremy Davies, and the eloquent off stage narrator John Hurt.  Despite the length of the film (close to three hours) the tension never lapses.  The only true criticism of the film is some very unnecessarily choppy editing.  The musical score is haunting and the final credits (von Trier tastefully opens his film with no credits at all) are presented with many of the photographs of Dorothea Lange from her Depression Series, and photographs by other artists who show the effects of poverty throughout the world.  It leaves you breathless.  This film is a triumph, it calls for your involvement as a viewer, and it has lessons about morality and the individual's plight in an angry world.

828733,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B00029QXAK,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[2, 3]","Denmark's Lars von Trier, one of their finest directors, is also one of the most polarising filmmakers today.  He's been rather quiet as of late, not making a film since 2005, but he's still out there.  This film, Dogville, alternates between being brilliant, astonishing, and frustrating, but it's undeniably a work of art that has many cheering at the end and some demanding their money back.The film is shot in von Trier's hand held, digital video style that he's used since his TV series, The Kingdom (this was the series that Kingdom Hospital was based on).  While I generally dislike hand held camerawork (it's way overdone in my opinion), von Trier's hand held style is not straightforward.  It's a hand held/jump cut style, where von Trier gets to the heart of the scene with no desire for strict continuity.  In the hands of a lesser director, this would be a disaster, but in the hands of Lars, it works amazingly well.  Von Trier operates the camera himself, with his director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle (the cinematographer who recently won an Academy Award for his work on Slumdog Millionare).This film concerns itself with many things.  America, idealism (and foolish idealism), hypocrisy, anger, foolishness, and the darker side of human nature.  The film is shot entirely on a soundstage with very few props, like Thorton Wilder's Our Town, where you imagine most of what's going on.  This technique lends itself to deeply fascinating shots, where von Trier holds a long shot where you can see inside two houses, and see what's going on in one house, while something related is going on in another house.  It creates a startling distancing effect, and it's quite effective.John Hurt's narration is quite caustic and acerbic, and he reads it very well.  The performances are very good, with Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany particularly good.  The only thing I don't really like about this work is the rather stilted English dialogue.  Von Trier has filmed in English many times, but his dialogue always has a tendency to be ""learned"" American English rather than ""natural"" American English.

The questions?Can a town be so horrible that it should be wiped off the face of the earth? Dogville answers that question somewhat. In retrospect, Kidman's character seems to be a Christ-figure, an idealist trying to forgive. But in the end, we conclude, nay, we demand that Dogville be destroyed, and all that dwell within - even its children. We want her to choose vengeance. We know that it would be justified.And suddenly we understand why Sodom and Gomorrah were judged for ""inhospitality."" And more importantly, we can understand why they could be judged in that manner, how mere people can warrant such a terrible fate.Too bad the script is a pig's breakfast. As I said, preternaturally self-conscious, trying so hard to be profound, yet it moves so slowly and predictably and ... pedestrian(-ally?). The acting ... well, the actors do their best with the disaster they were given to work with, but it comes off as mostly unnatural, untrue-to-life. The cadence is Mamet-wannabe.

It is straightforward, visceral, and, in a way, very realistic. Potential viewers will not have to worry about being bored by some vague, pretentious message explained in an abstract artsy style. What Dogville presents, instead of moral allegory, is - in the fashion of Lord of the Flies, the works of Jerzy Kosinski and, more recently, the Japanese Battle Royale - a simple portrait of how people will behave under certain extreme circumstances. Dogville clearly has no moral; its moralizing characters are punished perhaps the most severely. It does establish moral _problems_ which give the viewer something to consider after the film is over. What it does best, though, is engage the viewer and cleverly play with their sympathies. It connects on the level of a horror film in the intimate associations formed with the characters.

Under these considerations we will become silent witness of  abominable corporal abuses and physical sadism, double moral behaviors, acid comments under the holly blanket of dogmatism and religious fervor (the sordid sequence in which the bells mask the aggression is simply magisterial).Triers, to my mind is one of the most gifted directors in the world actually: In my previous review about Zentropa (1992) I remarked his visual and storytelling innovations. And Dogville represents (at the present moment, because with the genius the definitive statement is never possible), the supreme summit of his original career.I hope you agree with me when I say that Triers reached the cathartic state at the end of the film, without stylized concessions or intellectual pretensions. And considering the fact the elapsed time is 170 min. the wholeness of the human soul (with all its imaginable and glittering morbidity and rotten nakedness) was showed with all its tempestuous rage with a minimum of resources, but talent in its highest level.

828742,A2B0XO8BTPRX7R,B00029QXAK,Ian Vance,"[6, 8]","Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier occupies the coveted and much-acclaimed/decried position of the auteur: the cinematic craftsman of visionary power. Von Trier's films, particularly the recent compositions of *Breaking the Waves* (1996) and *Dancer in the Dark* (2000), have astonished/infuriated both the avant-garde and mainstream audience: with their intricate meld of art-house technique (the infamous Dogme 95 movement) and emotional manipulation that, for some, reaches borderline-bathos, Von Trier's films compel the base instincts, inspire heated conversation...and most importantly, continue to build upon previous work, achieving new vistas of theme, ambition and overall `modus operandi.'The cost of such vision is, apparently, quite exacting: Von demands much of his tools, and can be abusive to achieve his desired result.  After *Dancer in the Dark* Bjork announced she would never act again; Nicole Kidman, during press at Cannes, hinted at her personal struggle with Grace's character arc and the overall tone of *Dogville*.  Yet an uncompromising attitude often strains the best juice from the pulp, the end result being the important emphasis: whatever _works_.  And the end result here is like a thorn in the heart - it cannot be ignored.*Dogville* is, in essence, a study of humanity at its most tribal-base, set within the modern-era microcosm of the small town.  Initially I was off-put by the theater setting: it seemed an awkward, pretentious device.  This sensation was augmented by the distracting lighting variations, which I initially took to be bad DVD transfer.  As the film progressed, however, the invisible walls came to serve story and theme, revealing the sordid hypocrisies seething beneath the tranquil faade.  Showy technique showed more than I anticipated; it was a conceit I came to admire.A prologue introduces the audience to allegorical Dogville, rural USA epitomized.  Isolated from the world at large by a mountain range, the village consists of fourteen souls existing in relative harmony, the sort of apple-orchid haven not inconsistent with the Pastures and Valleys of Steinbeck's So Cal exegesis.  Secrets, sorrow and resentment ferment beneath the small town surface, but everyone knows their place, everyone tolerates to a greater or lesser extent the frailties of one another through virtue of long-term association.But come the gloaming of one dusk evening, resident philosopher/artiste Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) hears gunfire in the distance, and his investigation reveals a beautiful damsel in distress, Grace (Nicole Kidman, in perhaps the most accomplished role of her career).  Tom is instantly smitten by the fur-coiffed, strawberry-blonde Grace; and she in turn throws her fate upon his mercy, revealing a frailty that, we later come to understand, is as much subconscious psychological _testing_ as it is immediate conscious need.  Grace's predicament, indeed her very presence, is viewed with some suspicion and consternation by the other Dogville residents: she is the seductive Apple in the Garden, foreign yet ultimately irresistible.*Dogville* is a long film - two and half hours - with the first half devoted to the aesthetic construction of the community at large and the individual roles the town residents play in their fragile symbiosis. As the movie progresses Grace is accepted and comes to occupy a greater responsibility in the foundation-activities of the community, yet ever remains the outsider, the alien corn.  Exploitation emerges slowly, with doomed certainty, for Grace's charm, beauty and overall usefulness, coupled with her frail position, ""plants seeds that must surely grow,"" to paraphrase the justification of one offender.The eventual climax/conclusion of *Dogville* comes as no surprise.  Von Trier illustrates the proverb of ""Every Dog will Have it's Day"" with a philosophical argument between Kidman and an unsurprising cameo about humanity in general - exposing and effectively condemning the pity-route of the Great White Guilt.  The result of stripped illusions cannot be shrugged off, the other cheek turned; under a bloody moon Grace transfigures herself from victim to jury/judge.  Some will perceive this entire segment, and the movie as a whole, as a misanthropic exercise of cynicism.  I, a survivor of small town USA xenophobia, am torn in my overall assessment: my social-theory recognition is marred with the evocation of ancient wish-fulfillment fantasy, augmented by an inescapable cinematic surge of Platonic justice - the visceral climatic need - as served with extreme prejudice.  But regardless of my own emotional impression, this remains a powerful film, a dark and demanding theatre of (in)humanity at its most base fragility.Highly recommended.",5,Dog Days: A Theatre of

Lars von Trier follows up Dancer in the Dark, with an even darker view of small town life in America. In this case, we find a town quite literally at the end of the road, buried in a hollow somewhere in West Virginia, where the denizens are reduced to having to pick up the scraps left behind by others and live out a marginal existence. But, in its midst there is a dreamer, Tom, who at first appears to be the moral bellwether of the community. He tries to convince the community to take in a fugitive, evocatively played by Nicole Kidman, and finds that he has to make certain concessions in order to do so.This film unfolds on stage as a highly theatrical telling, lending to the story the strong sense of a parable. Von Trier has assembled an impressive cast including old favorites Lauren Bacall and Ben Gazzara. The story builds slowly, with some fascinating twists and turns before reaching its shattering climax. It reminded me a lot of Shirley Jackson's classic story, The Lottery, but seems to owe more to the small town vision of Sinclair Lewis and Thornton Wilder.I suppose some will be turned off by von Trier's disturbing view of small town life, but this film is masterfully handled, and shows what an accomplished director he is, drawing the most from his actors, in particular Nicole Kidman.",4,A lot of bite to this movie,1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,1416,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'movie', 'finally', 'made', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'States', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'up', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'even', 'darker', 'view', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'America', 'case', 'find', 'town', 'quite', 'literally', 'end', 'road', 'buried', 'hollow', 'somewhere', 'West', 'Virginia', 'where', 'denizens', 'are', 'reduced', 'having', 'pick', 'up', 'scraps', 'left', 'behind', 'others', 'live', 'out', 'marginal', 'existence', 'midst', 'dreamer', 'Tom', 'who', 'first', 'be', 'moral', 'bellwether', 'community', 'convince', 'community', 'take', 'fugitive', 'evocatively', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'make', 'certain', 'concessions', 'order', 'do', 'so.This', 'film', 'unfolds', 'stage', 'highly', 'theatrical', 'telling', 'lending', 'story', 'strong', 'sense', 'parable', 'Von', 'Trier', 'assembled', 'impressive', 'cast', 'including', 'old', 'favorites', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'story', 'slowly', 'fascinating', 'twists', 'before', 'reaching', 'shattering', 'climax', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'classic', 'story', 'Lottery', 'owe', 'more', 'small', 'town', 'vision', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'Thornton', 'Wilder.I', 'suppose', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'von', 'Trier', 'disturbing', 'view', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'film', 'masterfully', 'handled', 'what', 'accomplished', 'director', 'drawing', 'most', 'actors', 'particular', 'Nicole', 'Kidman']",N/A

Well, it is uplifting because it holds up a mirror. Those who don't like what they see may be seeing themselves represented on screen.Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the ideal character of the film, and yet she is persecuted and taken advantage of by good-intentioned (and emotionally-blind) citizens of Dogville. Tom is the man Grace slowly falls in love with, yet he is the same person leading the town's citizens into a moral crusade against her. The climax of the love story comes when Grace finally realizes Tom is not the good-hearted man she once loved, and acts accordingly.  With the powerful words from her father (James Caan), Grace learns that she has been arrogant by not making people accountable for their cruelty, because she has not held others to the same moral standards she holds herself. She considers others incapable of those standards (and, considering she is an ideal character, she is probably right).The core of the film is the love story--the disillusionment of Grace when she realizes the true nature of Tom.

There are a number of reasons for this:  its more like a play than a movie (the ""set"" is really a stage), its extremely long (nearly 3 hours), its heavy on dialog but lite on action, the plot unfolds at the same rate that grass grows, and it doesn't fit into any traditional movie genre.  However, if you can wade through all that, you'll discover Dogville delivers a powerful thesis on human nature that has plenty of ""bite"".  The story itself is about a beautiful, fragile woman on the run (Grace) and the town that ""befriends"" her.  Of course, neither Grace or the town are quite what they appear to be.  Like a mean dog, the town eventually turns on the pure-hearted Grace--while she struggles to maintain her dignity and ideals. Perhaps the most pathetic character is Tom, the town's erstwhile philosopher and full-time layabout, who has professed his love for Grace (and she for he).  Despite his role as the town's moral compass, Tom stands idly by as Grace is increasingly humiliated, abused, and ultimately enslaved by his fellow townsfolk--so much for true love.  As the movie reaches its climax, Grace suffers a final betrayal at Tom's hands and the town is exposed for what it is (the transparency of the set itself helps reinforce this point).  With her faith in the goodness of humanity gone, Grace ends up embracing what she once shunned.  Will Dogville survive?  And should it?  The ending is appalling, yet satisfying from both a cinematic and emotional standpoint, and a James Caan cameo provides the icing on the cake.  If you want to see a movie that showcases the best & worst of human nature, I highly recommend Dogville.",4,"Starts Slow, Stays Slow, but Packs a Powerful Wallop",1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,1763,"['Dogville', 'movie', 'will', 'disappoint', 'most', 'conventional', 'viewers', 'came', 'close', 'turning', 'off', 'few', 'times', 'are', 'number', 'reasons', 'more', 'play', 'movie', 'set', 'really', 'stage', 'extremely', 'long', 'nearly', '3', 'hours', 'heavy', 'dialog', 'lite', 'action', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'same', 'rate', 'grass', 'grows', ""n't"", 'fit', 'traditional', 'movie', 'genre', 'However', 'can', 'wade', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'Dogville', 'powerful', 'thesis', 'human', 'nature', 'plenty', 'bite', 'story', 'beautiful', 'fragile', 'woman', 'run', 'Grace', 'town', 'befriends', 'course', 'Grace', 'town', 'are', 'quite', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'mean', 'dog', 'town', 'eventually', 'pure-hearted', 'Grace', 'maintain', 'dignity', 'ideals', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'pathetic', 'character', 'Tom', 'town', 'erstwhile', 'philosopher', 'full-time', 'layabout', 'who', 'professed', 'love', 'Grace', 'role', 'town', 'moral', 'compass', 'Tom', 'idly', 'Grace', 'increasingly', 'humiliated', 'abused', 'ultimately', 'enslaved', 'fellow', 'townsfolk', 'so', 'much', 'true', 'love', 'movie', 'climax', 'Grace', 'final', 'betrayal', 'Tom', 'hands', 'town', 'exposed', 'what', 'transparency', 'set', 'reinforce', 'point', 'faith', 'goodness', 'humanity', 'gone', 'Grace', 'up', 'embracing', 'what', 'once', 'shunned', 'Will', 'Dogville', 'survive', 'should', 'ending', 'appalling', 'yet', 'satisfying', 'cinematic', 'emotional', 'standpoint', 'James', 'Caan', 'cameo', 'icing', 'cake', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'best', 'worst', 'human', 'nature', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Dogville']",N/A

828758,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00029QXAK,Josh Hitchens,"[11, 14]","Lars von Trier's ""Dogville"" is one of the best films of the year. It is also sometimes very difficult to watch because of its subject matter and three hour running time. However, it is an extremely great movie, worth every second you put into it. Trier's direction and screenplay are superb, and the acting by the ensemble of sixteen actors is uniformly excellent.""Dogville"" tells the story of Grace (Nicole Kidman), a woman who is on the run from her mobster father. She makes her way to Dogville, a small, forgotten town of only fifteen residents and a dog. Grace meets Tom Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany), a young would-be writer who tries to understand the human condition. The residents of Dogville give Grace two weeks to endear herself to them. Grace does this by performing small chores for the residents: babysitting the children of Vera (Patricia Clarkson), helping Chuck (Stellan Skarsgaard) in his apple orchard, working at Ma Ginger's (Lauren Bacall) general store, and being a companion for an old blind man (Ben Gazzara). The town allows her to stay, and for a while Grace is very happy there. To Grace, Dogville is a place ""where people have hopes and dreams."" She and Tom slowly begin to fall in love, but there are subtle clues that something ominous is on the way. Soon Dogville turns against Grace, chaining her up like an animal, making her into a virtual slave. She is also subjected to nightly rape by the men of the town. When Grace's father returns, she decides to exercise violent retribution against the citizens of Dogville.The experimental way in which ""Dogville"" was shot is fascinating and arresting. The town is represented by chalk outlines on a large soundstage, with the actors miming the opening and closing of doors. There are some fragments of set pieces, like a desk, bed, or bench, but for the most part the stage is blank. This allows you to see what all the characters are doing all of the time, and forces you to focus on the people and the acting. ""Dogville"" works so well because it takes the time to define all of its inhabitants. Paul Bettany is great as Tom, and Patricia Clarkson is positively brilliant as the cruel and fragile Vera. Other standouts are Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Skarsgaard, and Chloe Sevigny. John Hurt is also noteworthy as the film's acidic narrator. But as Grace, Nicole Kidman delivers an emotionally naked performance that stands proudly alongside her revelatory work in ""The Hours."" Her Grace is a good, trusting, forgiving woman who opens her heart to Dogville, which in turn tries to destroy her. Kidman is utterly amazing to watch, and Trier puts her through immense pain and suffering. It's no surprise that Kidman backed out of the second film in this trilogy. Her intense work on ""Dogville"" was probably not something she could endure again. But we are left with a raw and stunning performance from the best actress of her generation.At three hours, ""Dogville"" does run a little long, but every scene is essential. Because you spend so much time with this town and its people, you become deeply involved in what happens. ""Dogville"" is also a very disturbing movie to watch, with the inhuman cruelty visited on Grace and the violent, shocking denoument. It has been said that the film is anti-American, and I would have to agree. With one of the central themes being the destructiveness of arrogance and an ending credits sequence that shows pictures of the homeless to the tune of David Bowie's ""Young Americans,"" it is obvious where Trier's sympathies lie. But so what if the movie is anti-American? It is a brave, brilliant film that dares to show the darkness of human nature, which is completely universal. Anyone interested in challenging filmmaking should see it.""Dogville"" is not solely about Grace's transformation from a good and trusting woman into a cold killer. It's more complex than that. In the end, when Grave is as cruel and inhumane to Dogville as it was to her, Trier shows a shot of her face.

Consequently, a narrator has to explain everything because you otherwise can't tell from the sedated performances.  The Tom character incessantly grows more and more insipid and annoying.  Even the kid is an annoying jerk, just wanting to be spanked by Grace, obviously because he gets a charge out of it...So, by the time the rape scene started I figured it was time to move on and skipped through to the end.  I could see where it was going and frankly, had no interest in plodding any further along with it.  As a fable, allegory or metaphor, it merely ended up disconnected, unrealistic, moralistic and preachy if anything at all, and ultimately, not very interesting or poignant.If this is what Von Trier really thinks of human nature, American or otherwise, I pity the poor fool.  If he's trying to make some kind of deep allegorical statement about anything, American imperialism, immigration, human nature, or whatever, the overly simplistic plot just falls on it's face.  I don't care if he's been to America or not, he's simply a lousy storyteller here.  Sophomoric and pointless.Aptly named though, the movie IS truly a dog.

828764,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00029QXAK,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[10, 13]","The Danish Lars von Trier is a cinematic visionary and his creation Dogville is an example of his remarkable cinematic genius. The film is shot in a studio where white lines on the floor depict the where the houses and other significant landmarks are located. There is some minute use of mise-en-scene such as a top of a bell tower floating in mid air by wires and small porcelain figurines, but most of the mise-en-scene is completely removed. The transparent environment produces an atmosphere without secrets and the true nature of people is completely revealed when an opportunity appears.The story takes place in the small mountain village, Dogville, which is located in Colorado during the Great Depression. The young aspiring writer and philosopher Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) wanders through Dogville one late evening when he hears a shot, and later discovers Grace (Nicole Kidman). Grace has escaped pursuing gangsters and Tom decides to act as Grace's savior as he becomes infatuated with her. Tom presents Grace to the village's 15 adult inhabitants as he intends to let the village decide whether she can join the village or not. The people of Dogville give Grace two weeks to prove that she is an honorable person and not a threat.Grace offers herself to the town by helping with the towns chores. Initially Grace faces resistance to her presence, however, the people of Dogville decide that she is useful and they let her stay. This is the beginning of a wonderful time for Grace, but when the police turn up in the small village claiming that she is a dangerous bank robber and she has committed several robberies while she has been in Dogville townsfolk begin to demand more from her. The demands are a lead up to a beginning of a brutal exploitation of Grace's persona while Tom feebly attempts to find a reason to the madness and an escape for Grace.Dogville is a disturbing film with a straight forward story. However, the politics behind the film have an allegorical value as it seems to draw from both historical and contemporary issues. The film strongly hints toward the use of allegory since the intended use of almost no mise-en-scene was cleverly manufactured by von Trier. The story is well directed as the film progresses with ease as it is both chaptered and well-written. When the cinematography, mise-en-scene, cast performance, and script is put together it offers a brilliant cinematic experience that the audience can ponder and discuss for a lengthy time since it can be related to issues that have affected the world.",5,Brilliant Transparency in Disturbing Cinematic Experience...,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,2551,"['Danish', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'cinematic', 'visionary', 'creation', 'Dogville', 'example', 'remarkable', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'film', 'shot', 'studio', 'where', 'white', 'lines', 'floor', 'where', 'houses', 'other', 'significant', 'landmarks', 'are', 'located', 'minute', 'use', 'mise-en-scene', 'such', 'top', 'bell', 'tower', 'floating', 'mid', 'air', 'wires', 'small', 'porcelain', 'figurines', 'most', 'mise-en-scene', 'completely', 'removed', 'transparent', 'environment', 'atmosphere', 'secrets', 'true', 'nature', 'people', 'completely', 'revealed', 'when', 'opportunity', 'appears.The', 'story', 'place', 'small', 'mountain', 'village', 'Dogville', 'located', 'Colorado', 'Great', 'Depression', 'young', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'philosopher', 'Tom', 'Edison', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'wanders', 'Dogville', 'one', 'late', 'evening', 'when', 'shot', 'later', 'discovers', 'Grace', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Grace', 'escaped', 'pursuing', 'gangsters', 'Tom', 'act', 'Grace', 'savior', 'infatuated', 'Tom', 'Grace', 'village', '15', 'adult', 'inhabitants', 'let', 'village', 'decide', 'can', 'join', 'village', 'not', 'people', 'Dogville', 'give', 'Grace', 'two', 'weeks', 'prove', 'honorable', 'person', 'not', 'threat.Grace', 'town', 'helping', 'towns', 'chores', 'Initially', 'Grace', 'resistance', 'presence', 'however', 'people', 'Dogville', 'decide', 'useful', 'let', 'stay', 'beginning', 'wonderful', 'time', 'Grace', 'when', 'police', 'turn', 'up', 'small', 'village', 'claiming', 'dangerous', 'bank', 'robber', 'committed', 'several', 'robberies', 'been', 'Dogville', 'townsfolk', 'begin', 'demand', 'more', 'demands', 'are', 'lead', 'up', 'beginning', 'brutal', 'exploitation', 'Grace', 'persona', 'Tom', 'feebly', 'find', 'reason', 'madness', 'escape', 'Grace.Dogville', 'disturbing', 'film', 'straight', 'forward', 'story', 'However', 'politics', 'film', 'have', 'allegorical', 'value', 'draw', 'historical', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'film', 'strongly', 'use', 'allegory', 'intended', 'use', 'almost', 'mise-en-scene', 'was', 'cleverly', 'manufactured', 'von', 'Trier', 'story', 'well', 'directed', 'film', 'ease', 'chaptered', 'well-written', 'When', 'cinematography', 'mise-en-scene', 'cast', 'performance', 'script', 'put', 'together', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'audience', 'can', 'ponder', 'discuss', 'lengthy', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'related', 'issues', 'have', 'affected', 'world']",N/A

When she is given a chance to revenge herself on the ""good intentioned"" citizens who have tormented her, her lack of animation makes the final scene all the more chilling.Von Trier takes his minimalist philosophy to a new extreme with Dogville's set design. The story is enacted on a soundstage consisting of outlines drawn on the ground to indicate buildings and stenciled labels indicating ""Gooseberry Bush"" or other objects. To me this is a brilliant use of foreshadowing in cinema as it reminds one of a crime scene on some unconscious level.At first the set is jarring and the movie a slow starter. There was a point where I said to myself: ""Do I really want to sit through three hours of this?"" I'm glad I stuck it out. The story is engrossing once your mind adapts itself to the unconventional visuals. This film proves the gestalt theory perfectly.A lot of critics have blasted this movie as ""Anti-American.""

While narrator John Hurt intorduces us to the place and the people we look at an overhead view of the ""town"" of Dogville.  On a large sound stage we can see the few houses, shacks we are told, of Dogville, all outlined in chalk and labeled for our benefit.  There are a few pieces of furniture, a desk or a bed, but everything else is gone.  The focus here is to be on the characters and the story.Clearly von Trier intends to be provocative and his unsettling film is certainly going to get audiences thinking, although exactly what they are going to end up thinking is going to be as much up to the individual as it is to what von Trier has put together.  Then throw into the mix that at 177 minutes long the patience of viewers might be sorely tested before we get to the payoff, but the payoff is such that you should stick around to the end before you make up your mind about ""Dogville.""  The story is told in scenes, so you have clear opportunities to take breaks and get some air, which you are probably going to need at some point in the proceedings.The town of Dogville is in the Rocky Mountains during the Great Depression.  One day a young woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives in Dogville, fleeing from gangsters.  Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), a young man who considers himself to be a philosopher, hides her and persuades his neighbors to give her a chance.  For a two-week period she will have a trial run and then they will decide what to do with her and whether they will allow her to stay in their little town.  Tom persuades Grace, who has never done physical labor, to offer to do such work for each person in town, but the citizens of Dogville are, if anything, insulted by the idea that they are not doing what needs be done.  So instead of doing what needs to be done Grace offers to do more trivial things that people would like to have done.For a while Grace appears to be fitting in and she proves her worth to the lady who runs the general store (Lauren Bacall), the guy who grows apples (Stellan Skarsgard) and his wife (Patricia Clarkson), the blind man (Ben Gazzara), Tom's dad the retired doctor (Philip Baker Hall), and the rest.  But then everything changes.  The gangsters trying to find Grace have the cops putting up wanting posters saying she committed a string of bank robberies.  The people of Dogville know this is not true, since she was with them during that time, but this new fact changes their relationship with Grace.  Now, instead of seeing her as someone who is helping them, they see her as being helpless, and they take full advantage of it as they find a multitude of ways to abuse Grace.The biggest clues with regards to the allegorical elements of the film come from Tom Edison's philosophical pronouncements.  He is always trying to persuade the townspeople and/or Grace to his way of thinking and always trying to find illustrations and object lessons to make his point.  The fact that things get progressively worse for Grace is lost on Tom, and they really do get worse for Grace, whose knowledge of the philosophy of stoicism does not serve her as well as you would have thought.  Everything in ""Dogville"" has a deeper meaning and even if you do not want to diver into the allegory you can still appreciate the twisted weirdness of it all as Grace endures what Dogville has to offer and Tom sacrifices his supposed idealism to much more baser interests.  You know that in the end the gangsters will come for Grace, so the question is whether or not that will be a good thing or not for both her and the people of Dogville.  Obviously our sympathies are with Grace, but that does not mean anything in the ugly little corner of the world van Trier has created.During the end credits, as David Bowie's ""Young Americans"" play over photographs from Jacob Holdt's book ""American Pictures,"" van Trier makes it clear that he is pointing the finger at the United States (and it is also clear which finger her is pointing).  I do not know if I have ever seen end credits that have undercut the effectiveness of a film as much as what we have here.  I understood that van Trier was attacking America and the end credits serve as adding injury to insult because to me it basically says ""You people are probably too stupid to know that I am attacking you, so let me twist the knife until you get the point.""  I am willing to sit through a condemnation of American culture and international policy, but van Trier does not have to be so patronizing about it.  I certainly do not remember Bertolt Brecht being patronizing, although I appreciate it is strange to wait until the end credits to criticize van Trier for being nasty in his attack.""Dogville"" is the first in von Trier's third trilogy series entitled ""USA: Land of Opportunities.""  The next film, to be released in 2005, is ""Mandalay"" (2005), a story of slavery, also set in the 1930s but this time in the American South. Bryce Dallas Howard (""The Village"") will now be playing Grace and several of the same actors from ""Dogville"" will be in ""Mandalay"" (e.g., Lauren Bacall, Jeremy Davies), but in different roles.  The movie had an interesting controversy in that actor John C. Reilly walked off the set and was replaced after a donkey was killed on film.  The final film in the trilogy will be ""Washington,"" and we can obviously all look forward to be provoked further in the future.",4,"""Dogville"" is ""Our Town"" gone to Hell in a

828775,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00029QXAK,Linda Linguvic,"[8, 10]","It's a full three hours long.  It's depressing.  It's a film about America from a Danish director who has never set foot in the United States.  And it feels like a play that has been filmed because of its stark set.  Yes, it's about a town but the audience only sees chalk marks where houses are supposed to be and the very most vague Styrofoam or wooden partially built sets.  Everything, from the dialog to the narration to the titles on the screen is of the minimalist variety. It's the kind of film that holds controversy as its core and likely to be analyzed to death.It does have star quality though.  The voice is John Hurt, a narrator we never see.  He's the storyteller, and moves along the action, interpreting things that the audience would be able to see for themselves if he just stopped talking.  The scene is a small town named Dogville in 1920s America.  There are 15 residents of the town -- all leading harsh and unhappy lives.  Nicole Kidman seems to come out of nowhere, running from the mob.  The town decides to hide her and she must win them over.  At first they say they don't need help but little by little she does a service for each of them.  She reads to a blind man, she baby-sits for a family's children, she works in an apple orchard, she weeds the gooseberries.  At first they love her.  Then they take her for granted.  And then, when she tries to run away, they keep her captive. Eventually we see the ugly side of each of them.  And, at the end, we see Nichole Kidman's ugly side too.Certainly, this film was much much too long.  It drove home its points over and over again.  I wanted to scream ""enough already""!  It also shows the cruel side of human beings.  It goes on and on.  Too much!  I hadn't realized a non-American director made it until the very end.  And it was only later that I came to understand that he made this film to be particularly negative to Americans.  That's funny.  Because even though Dogville was set in America, it was clear to me throughout that it could have been set any place in the world.  Negative and hurtful human beings are everywhere.Some people will consider Dogville a work of art.  It reminds me of some of the exhibits I've seen at the Guggenheim Museum and couldn't help but raise a quizzical eyebrow.  The work might be articulated well, but the art comes straight from a sick and twisted mind.  It left me disturbed and somewhat angry.  However, I cannot say this was a bad film.  It a way it was a work of genius.  But it's not the kind of genius I either like or admire. Film buffs should see it for curiosity alone.

The follow-up ""Manderlay"" answered a few questions raised by this movie, but this is a standalone experiment that often works. Is it a classic? By our standards, yes. By Trier's standards, he has done better in the past.The idea of setting the entire film on the soundstage with no props or external environment is something that works to great effect in the beginning, and then fast loses steam. The only thing that holds all of this together is the exciting performance by Nicole Kidman who OWNS her role here. She has never been better, and watch her here to understand how she remains an underrated actress (she is better here than she was in 'The Hours').Political consciousness and an Anti-American sentiment are obviously present throughout Lars' work, but the point is to understand it from a Scandinavian's perspective rather than call all his work 'anti-American'. On 'Dogville', he raises some interesting questions about privacy, revenge, and culpability, and I think he speaks to the entire world at large here, not just America. By transposing the 'them' vs 'us' aspect of society on a bare stage with fine actors in minimal clothing, this becomes a work of art. Pure transcendence.Make sure you're ready for a bit of experimental cinema if you want to enjoy this.

Well where on Earth is this not the case? Power can corrupt, and those without any can be overzealous when they taste some for themselves.It should not be a surprise to anyone that, yes, this is a part of our shared human nature, but it has been more cleverly and convincingly and more evenhandedly demonstrated in any number of 1/2 hour twilight zone episodes, than it was in this 3 hour stage play, so disconnected from the reality it is trying to portray.Is it that all people are bad? This is certainly true, but this is only like describing the taste of a grape in terms of it's skin, while completely ignoring its more appealing parts, Humanity is much more complex than this film seems to understand, and the film is an insult to the intelligence to anyone who has given real thought to the good and bad of human nature, where it comes from, and how and when it's complexity is expressed.And what is the point of having it staged? Any message can be more effectively communicated using the full weight of the medium involved. Would it ever truly make sense to make a film using no sound at all, or using only a series of snap shots? Apparently there are many here who might be fooled into applauding such a film for it's originality, when the only real effect such limitations have, is to simplify and limit any originality that could have been possible given no such constraints..In closing this was a long slog through the mud that will only serve to further confuse people who have never had the time to think very deeply on human nature. It is very much like the blind trying to lead the blind, and so perhaps it is fitting that the experience of the average viewer of this film would not be much different from the blind man, who could only listen to it.

828784,A148MMCVL4BAZ1,B00029QXAK,"Mark Tusher ""working class hero""","[2, 4]","If nothing else Dogville is like no other movie I have ever seen. In fact, after leaving the theater I felt more like I just read a good book or watched an excellent play. Like in many fine books Dogville utilizes quite effectively a narration, done masterfully by John Hurt, to help us understand the depths and layers of the subject matter. The movie opens announcing there will be a prologue followed by the unfolding of nine chapters. By the time the final chapter closes we feel as if we spent a lifetime with the movie's characters--and that's meant in a good way.Dogville could be called the quintessential arthouse film. It's bold, provocative, risk taking and moody. It uses one large stage (throughout the whole movie), that reflects an exercise in minimalism. No real sets, no doors, no windows. All the walls were invisible, except the human ones. It chooses to use chalk outlines to portray dogs and gooseberry bushes. All this in an effort to help the viewer laser focus on the subject matter.The Dutch director Lars von Trier, as evidenced by his ""Breaking The Waves,"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"" is anything but conventional. He is a man who is obviously housing a lot of pain and goes to great lengths to assure his viewers don't escape without sharing some of it. ""Dogville"" is no exception.In response to any criticism claiming this movie carries an anti-American sentiment I say lighten up and watch the movie again. It's message is universal, has no nationality, and applies equally to all species of the human race. It just happened to take place in a small town in the Rocky mountains. It's about hypocrisy and pain. It's about suffering and healing and suffering again. It's about redemption and revenge. And crossroads, and missed opportunities.Anyone going to therapy might want to skip a week and buy a ten dollar ticket to this film and see if you don't get just as much out of it. Yes the film is infuriating, painful and uncomfortable, but that's why it's so effective. It slyly slips deeply down into the human psyche where our guilt and anger manifest and somehow finds a way to bring it to the surface for us to confront.Yes Dogville exaggerates the dark side of man (and woman) and magnifies its consequences, but as a result the message resonates and is impossible to ignore. Exactly what Trier was trying to do.And special kudos to the whole cast, who's ensemble performance had to be no easy task considering the set limitations and surroundings. In my opinion Nicole Kidman will NOT get nominated for this film (though her performance was worthy) for two reasons. One, the movie's release is almost a year from next year's Academy Awards show. And two, even more importantly, not enough people would be willing to invest their time or risk exposure to this insightful masterpiece. This movie is one in a thousand. Unfortunately not one in ten thousand people are probably willing to ever give it a chance.Mark Tusher",5,Like no other movie you've ever seen-Dogville,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,2951,"['nothing', 'else', 'Dogville', 'other', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'fact', 'leaving', 'theater', 'felt', 'more', 'just', 'read', 'good', 'book', 'watched', 'excellent', 'play', 'many', 'fine', 'books', 'Dogville', 'quite', 'effectively', 'narration', 'done', 'masterfully', 'John', 'Hurt', 'help', 'understand', 'depths', 'layers', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'announcing', 'will', 'be', 'prologue', 'followed', 'unfolding', 'nine', 'chapters', 'time', 'final', 'chapter', 'feel', 'spent', 'lifetime', 'movie', 'characters', 'meant', 'good', 'way.Dogville', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'quintessential', 'arthouse', 'film', 'bold', 'provocative', 'risk', 'taking', 'moody', 'one', 'large', 'stage', 'whole', 'movie', 'exercise', 'minimalism', 'real', 'sets', 'doors', 'windows', 'walls', 'were', 'invisible', 'human', 'ones', 'use', 'chalk', 'outlines', 'portray', 'dogs', 'gooseberry', 'bushes', 'effort', 'help', 'viewer', 'laser', 'focus', 'subject', 'matter.The', 'Dutch', 'director', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'evidenced', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'anything', 'conventional', 'man', 'who', 'obviously', 'housing', 'lot', 'pain', 'great', 'lengths', 'assure', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'escape', 'sharing', 'Dogville', 'exception.In', 'response', 'criticism', 'claiming', 'movie', 'anti-American', 'sentiment', 'say', 'lighten', 'up', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'message', 'universal', 'nationality', 'applies', 'equally', 'species', 'human', 'race', 'just', 'happened', 'take', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'Rocky', 'mountains', 'hypocrisy', 'pain', 'suffering', 'healing', 'suffering', 'again', 'redemption', 'revenge', 'crossroads', 'missed', 'opportunities.Anyone', 'going', 'therapy', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'week', 'buy', 'ten', 'dollar', 'ticket', 'film', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Yes', 'film', 'infuriating', 'painful', 'uncomfortable', 'why', 'so', 'effective', 'slyly', 'slips', 'deeply', 'down', 'human', 'psyche', 'where', 'guilt', 'anger', 'manifest', 'somehow', 'way', 'bring', 'surface', 'confront.Yes', 'Dogville', 'dark', 'side', 'man', 'woman', 'consequences', 'result', 'message', 'resonates', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'Exactly', 'what', 'Trier', 'was', 'trying', 'do.And', 'special', 'kudos', 'whole', 'cast', 'who', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'had', 'be', 'easy', 'task', 'considering', 'set', 'limitations', 'surroundings', 'opinion', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'will', 'NOT', 'get', 'nominated', 'film', 'performance', 'was', 'worthy', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'movie', 'release', 'almost', 'year', 'next', 'year', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'show', 'two', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'invest', 'time', 'risk', 'exposure', 'insightful', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'one', 'thousand', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'one', 'ten', 'thousand', 'people', 'are', 'probably', 'willing', 'ever', 'give', 'chance.Mark', 'Tusher']",N/A

Either way it's most definitely a raw, but intriguing look at human nature, capitalism, the United States, the world and all it's good and bad. It's both unnerving and touching, we wish to turn away, but are pulled back in at the same time because of an intellectual and polarizing look at humanity. This is a bold film that has to be congratulated on those merits. Theatrical and fresh, whether you like or hate it (both of which I can so vividly understand).The film's setting of a small depression-era Colorado town Dogville is showcased on a single large set. Houses and landmarks are simply chalk lines on the floor accessorized by a few pieces of furniture and props. The open, single set allows the camera to zoom in and swoop wherever it pleases, taking us right into the story. Nothing is hidden in Dogville, at least from us. It forces us to concentrate on the terrific cast who are forced to tell us the story almost entirely by themselves. They're up to the challenge.There is no getting around, though, that the dissection of humanity here is scathingly true and that we want to turn away from the discussions the film has that tend to line up with our own lives, feelings, judgments, and, well, humanity and nature. The lack of walls gives us the ultimate ""if walls could talk"" look into the worlds that we can see all while our characters can see one, ignorant to the horrors we can so plainly see. We can no longer hide behind our walls and claim ignorance to the horrors of the world we don't want to accept as real.Nicole Kidman is fantastic, she'll get uncountable award nominations that are well deserved. She is Grace, a mystery woman on the run from gangsters who ends up in Dogville and is taken in by Tom (Paul Bettany) who falls for her face and charm. He soon convinces the residents to let her win their favor, which she does. Her frailty too is evident to those other than Tom, and they unlike he are readily willing to exploit her by hanging the fact that she is a threat to them. The duality of power and those who have it plays out throughout the film and takes a striking twist at the end that provides a shocking, provocative and proper ending of the film and it's themes.The claim of anti-Americanism are only for those pre-disposed to dislike the movie, despite the fact that the film does take stabs and capitalism and probably America by default because of it's universal representation of it to the world.

A large number of my fellow customers have taken care of that for me. I just want to make a couple of points.Despite sentiments expressed here that the film is Anti-American, it's not. Note the tagline...In a town not far from here... If it really was, would he have been able to round up(with the exception of Kidman)a cast completely made up of this brilliant bunch of American actors? Sadly, human cruelty is universal. And therein lies the point Von Trier is trying to make. For those who missed that point, I can only recommend a repeat viewing.It's not 3 hours long either. It's just over 2. But like DANCER IN THE DARK & ZENTROPA, when a film is as uniquely delivered as this one, who cares? I must admit that at one point, I felt the film started to drag. It was at that point that, like magic, Von Trier literally speeds up the action.

This very worthy and very long piece of 'parable' which explores the darkest and most primal side of human nature, and a side which potentionally lurks within all of us, would obviously work equally well in the theatre. The Brechtian alienation techniques clearly apparent in the floor marked rehearsal 'style' set, deliberatley underplayed performances and fairytale style narration. But this story is anything but a fairytale, infact the total antitheses. Set in a small isolated American town during the depression, 'Dogville', or at least elements of it, could of course exist anywhere (hence the undetailed and unrealistic set). The film pulls no punches in its grittingly bleak representation of human beings at their worst in desperate times. A small seemingly simple and welcoming community who reveal their true colours as they gradually begin to turn on the weaker member of the herd, the vulnerable outsider, like a flock of relentless vultures who have smelled the blood. Grace's(supposed) passive co-operativeness and'niceness' is rewarded at first but then becomes an easy target for exploitation and hideous abuse, as the villagers take advantage of her needy dilema.The film asks many moral and hypothetical questions in its allegory, and then finally answers them in the most unexpectedly shocking and brutal way at the film's climax, prompting the audience then to ask yet more questions. This is a deeply provoking and intellectual film, those looking for a relaxing night of popcorn and entertainment should give this one a miss. It's heavy chewing for the mind and blatantly confronting and hardhitting in its content.The strength of the movie is in the story and universal themes and questions it raises. This is my opinion, is not an 'actors' film. It's a writer/directors piece that could be played by no-bodies and probably would have more impact if it was, though not the commercial recognition. I didn't find Nicole Kidman's performance anything outstanding frankly, to me she seemed to be acting half asleep throughout the movie as if she was tranquillized. But in all honesty none of the actors performances stand out in my mind.

828803,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00029QXAK,Paul McGrath,"[18, 26]","This is a pretty interesting film for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it takes huge risks.  In an age in which most filmmakers go out of their way to avoid risks, this is no small thing.  And although it does give one a great deal to think about, at the end, its overwhelming, sodden, grim heavy-handedness dooms it to failure.The first interesting thing here is the set, which as everybody knows by now is very unusual.  It is nothing more than a bleak sound stage, with white painted lines on the floor to represent the buildings, streets, gardens, homes and even the dog of the small American town, Dogville.  There are no walls or other obstructions.Into this lovely place stumbles Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, who is clearly on the run from something or other.  The townspeople initially balk at helping her because of their fear of her pursuer, but after she begins to help them in various ways, they warm up to her.  Over time, and realizing the advantage they hold over her, they begin to mistreat her and ultimately abuse her in the most degrading fashion.  After a futile attempt at escape, a huge dog collar is put around her neck, and her leg is chained to a huge anvil-like thing, which she is forced to drag around.Needless to say, the film is meant to be symbolic, and there are unquestionably some very arresting images.  The July 4 dinner, for example, is celebrated by the townspeople seated at an outdoor table--except for the poorer family, who kind of stand forlornly at a corner.  All are properly reverent to the occasion, though.  The filmmaker means this to be ironic.Grace could be looked upon as symbolic of the immigrant experience in America.  She is welcomed, and returns this affection.  Indeed, she falls in love with the youthful all-American, Tom Edison, played by Paul Bettany. He churlishly spurns her affection though, and although he professes a willingness to help her, is so incompetent and ineffectual as to be useless.  As mentioned, as time goes by and as the town realizes she has no place to go, they ruthlessly exploit her then abuse her in sadistic, sexually degrading ways.  There is nothing she can do.  She has nowhere to go and no one to complain to:  the townspeople either refuse to believe her or blame her for her own problems.The town, of course, is America, and maybe even the world at large.  Tom is the left wing.  Completely self-absorbed, he ignores if not acquiesces in her bondage, then, feeling guilty or perhaps self-righteous, decides to help her by pushing her anchor.  He doesn't make any effort to REMOVE it, you'll note, he only helps her to push it around occasionally.Eventually, Grace is saved by her mobster, machine-gun-armed father, played by James Caan, who comes to town and is furious at these goings on.  She tries to plead with him to show some mercy to these people--wretched as they are--and all of a sudden, whoa, there is another shift.  Is she a Christ figure?  Is she going to make the ultimate sacrifice and allow herself to be crucified for them?Er, no.  Without giving anything away, let's just say that James Caan, the God figure in this little scenario, reacts in a more . . . Old Testament way.It's all quite interesting and thought-provoking, but like other projects of this type--and there have been hundreds if not thousands over the centuries--the nihilistic, misanthropic view presented here is simply not realistic.  To make his ponderous point, the filmmaker must necessarily twist his depiction of human nature to meet his needs.  There is no laughter here, for example.  No jokes or humor, grim or otherwise.  The subject of religion is completely avoided, even though Tom gives his speeches in what clearly must be the town church, and from which bells ring.Sure, human beings can be awful--nobody disagrees with this--but at the same time, they are just as often capable of acting in noble, altruistic ways.  There is no indication anywhere in this film that humans can do so.  (It's more than a little ironic that, although this film isn't necessarily anti-American, it does view humanity through the prism of America, which by just about any rational consensus has been the most humane society in history.)So in the end, interesting as this is, it is really just a heartless and cruel exercise.  Human beings as snarling dogs.  God as a murderer.

828804,A1QWG77KXFU4GI,B00029QXAK,Perrin Frch,"[4, 5]","Danish Director Lars Von Trier is a very unique film maker and has a very interesting view on the world. Dogville is a masterpiece that was kept under wraps until it's release. Dogville stars Nicole Kidman, in one of her best roles yet, as one of the leading characters Grace. Paul Bettany is excellent as Tom, who is an aspiring writer, who's plans are to get the towns people together to talk about the town plans. The film is told in nine chapters and is narrated by English actor John Hurt(Alien, 1984). The film was all shot in High-Definition hand held camera in a studio in Sweden. This film had been kept very secretive by Lars Von Trier and the rest of the cast and crew. Before it's release, there was no clips of the film, no pics, no plot synopsis, you would have had to actually go see the film to find out what it's actually about. Dogville was actually in competition for the prestigous Palme d'Or award for best picture at the Cannes Film Festival.Dogville is part one in Von Trier's USA trilogy, with Manderlay and Wasington as the follow ups. Dogville is a small town in the rocky mountains where it is filled with innocent hard working American citizens and have very forgivable problems about them. They are all viewed through Tom's eyes who is a man who enjoy's his quiet little town. Soon a young woman arrives that goes by the name of Grace, she's on the run from gangsters who she claims are after her. Tom feels he can't just give her into these gangsters and decides to hide her and give her shelter. The gangsters come by and ask the towns folk if they've seen her anywhere and tell them to contact them if they do. Tom decides to call a town meeting and introduce them to Grace, he tells them her dilema and asks them if she can work and live in the town if they don't go on to tell the gangsters. Throughout the film we see how society take advantage of blackmailing and how they take advantage of her problem and start to show betrayel and hatred.Dogville is stunning in every aspect. It has everything a theater and and an art-house cinema fan loves. First of all, this is Lars Von Trier, an absolute dynamite at storytelling and writing. I'm not just saying this because my dad's Danish and Von Trier is, I'm saying this because it's absolutely true. His previous stunners like Dancer In The Dark, Breaking The Waves and The Idiots are sparkling examples of why he's a genius, and this is one of them. Dogvile's uniqueness lies in the sets, acting, cinematography, and ofcourse the storytelling. The film is shot on a stage in Sweden, and has a very small production cost, the sets are very simple but effective and something that has never been done before. The buildings for example are simple lines of chalk, the doors and everything are drawn in chalk, so you can see everything that the people are doing, the characters obviously can't though. The camerawork is very much the same as Dancer In The Dark and has a very arty and independant feel to it. The acting is marvelous, it's pretty much like stage acting, they have alot of dialogue, they have detailed characters and are most certainly in character here. The musical score is very beautiful in this picture and keeps you more and more involved in the movie.Overall this film is nearly perfect but can't reccomend to the average movie goer/watcher. Dogville is nearly 3 hours long and has alot of dialogue, the average joe will find this boring, but the cinema fanatic who truly knows what is good and bad should have a go at this. As I said before the film is bassicly a filmed play, and will most likely not appeal to the average person, but the patient avid film fanatic should love every minute. This is truly an exhilarating experience and the finale proves to be a brilliant sign off to a truly magnificent film.The extra features on the region 2 disc aren't very impressive, it only has a trailer(it's actually quite good), the confessional box is a very good feature, it was a box confessional they had on the set where the actors could talk to the outside world so they didn't feel so alienated, and then there's a documentary about the film being shown at the Cannes Film Festival. Either way, you're getting the film, not the extra features. The film: 5/5, the extras: 3/5.",5,Lars Von Trier's Masterpiece,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,4277,"['Danish', 'Director', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'very', 'unique', 'film', 'maker', 'very', 'interesting', 'view', 'world', 'Dogville', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'kept', 'wraps', 'release', 'Dogville', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'yet', 'one', 'leading', 'characters', 'Grace', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'excellent', 'Tom', 'who', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'who', 'plans', 'are', 'get', 'towns', 'people', 'together', 'talk', 'town', 'plans', 'film', 'told', 'nine', 'chapters', 'narrated', 'English', 'actor', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Alien', '1984', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'High-Definition', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'studio', 'Sweden', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'kept', 'very', 'secretive', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'rest', 'cast', 'crew', 'release', 'was', 'clips', 'film', 'pics', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'actually', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'actually', 'about', 'Dogville', 'was', 'actually', 'competition', 'prestigous', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'award', 'best', 'picture', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival.Dogville', 'part', 'one', 'Von', 'Trier', 'USA', 'trilogy', 'Manderlay', 'Wasington', 'follow', 'ups', 'Dogville', 'small', 'town', 'rocky', 'where', 'filled', 'innocent', 'hard', 'working', 'American', 'citizens', 'have', 'very', 'forgivable', 'problems', 'are', 'viewed', 'Tom', 'eyes', 'who', 'man', 'who', 'enjoy', 'quiet', 'little', 'town', 'young', 'woman', 'name', 'Grace', 'run', 'gangsters', 'who', 'claims', 'are', 'Tom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'gangsters', 'decides', 'hide', 'give', 'shelter', 'gangsters', 'come', 'ask', 'towns', 'folk', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anywhere', 'tell', 'contact', 'do', 'Tom', 'call', 'town', 'meeting', 'introduce', 'Grace', 'dilema', 'can', 'work', 'live', 'town', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'tell', 'gangsters', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'society', 'take', 'advantage', 'blackmailing', 'how', 'take', 'advantage', 'problem', 'start', 'show', 'betrayel', 'hatred.Dogville', 'stunning', 'aspect', 'everything', 'theater', 'art-house', 'cinema', 'fan', 'loves', 'First', 'all', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'absolute', 'dynamite', 'storytelling', 'writing', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'saying', 'dad', 'Danish', 'Von', 'Trier', ""'m"", 'saying', 'absolutely', 'true', 'previous', 'stunners', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'Idiots', 'are', 'sparkling', 'examples', 'why', 'genius', 'one', 'Dogvile', 'uniqueness', 'lies', 'sets', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'storytelling', 'film', 'shot', 'stage', 'Sweden', 'very', 'small', 'production', 'cost', 'sets', 'are', 'very', 'simple', 'effective', 'something', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'buildings', 'example', 'are', 'simple', 'lines', 'chalk', 'doors', 'everything', 'are', 'drawn', 'chalk', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'people', 'are', 'doing', 'characters', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'though', 'camerawork', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'very', 'arty', 'independant', 'feel', 'acting', 'marvelous', 'pretty', 'much', 'stage', 'acting', 'have', 'alot', 'dialogue', 'have', 'detailed', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'certainly', 'character', 'here', 'musical', 'score', 'very', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'more', 'more', 'involved', 'movie.Overall', 'film', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reccomend', 'average', 'movie', 'goer/watcher', 'Dogville', 'nearly', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'alot', 'dialogue', 'average', 'joe', 'will', 'find', 'boring', 'cinema', 'fanatic', 'who', 'truly', 'what', 'good', 'bad', 'should', 'have', 'go', 'said', 'film', 'filmed', 'play', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'appeal', 'average', 'person', 'patient', 'avid', 'film', 'fanatic', 'should', 'love', 'minute', 'truly', 'exhilarating', 'experience', 'finale', 'proves', 'be', 'brilliant', 'sign', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'film.The', 'extra', 'features', 'region', '2', 'disc', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressive', 'only', 'trailer', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'confessional', 'box', 'very', 'good', 'feature', 'was', 'box', 'confessional', 'had', 'set', 'where', 'actors', 'could', 'talk', 'outside', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'alienated', 'then', 'documentary', 'film', 'being', 'shown', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'way', ""'re"", 'getting', 'film', 'not', 'extra', 'features', 'film', '5/5', 'extras', '3/5']",N/A

It is something we all engage in, rather egregiously, yet it is difficult to see if portrayed so vividly.  There is indeed destruction behind beauty, and despite conscious efforts and wishes to see something modified into a supposedly ""better"" condition, it becomes clear that the unconscious desire will ultimately wreak havoc, especially when aided by a dysfunctional and envious mass mentality.  Unintegration prevailed, and when a unifying force showed up in Dogville, one that could make the town actually unite in something positive (the admiration and appreciation of Grace's presence), the threat of disintegration ensued, and she needed to be destroyed and incorporated into the unintegrated structure.  There truly are no walls to hold us in, we are all very knowing and aware of what goes on in the minds and bodies of our fellow man, and truly the structures we edify are illusory and used as defense mechanisms so as to not have to identify with the perverse nature of others we see in ourselves.  This movie begets the question alluded to at the end, which I interpreted as ""is this town real?"" (reinforced by the drawing of the dog becoming real at that moment), and truly it is, real in every individual psychic microcosm as an intolerable reality; one may even sympathize with the murderous mobsters at the end wiping out the hapless people.

I think this could really depict any small, isolated community in the world. Yes the bare set was a little disconcerting, but it didn't bother me, it seemed like watching a play in my opinion. There's not much of a script either, but the narration by Jonathan hurt helps this film along. The basic plot of this film is: A young woman named grace stumbles across a sleepy town known as Dogville. She's on the run from the mob and willingly offers her services to the town in exchange for sanctuary there. Grace tries hard to please and gradually the reluctant townsfolk warm to her and take her in. This works great at first, and everyone agrees that the town is better off with her. Gradually however the townsfolk load more and more onto grace and seeing as she never retaliates or shows any anger or discomfort, they slowly take advantage of her more and more. In the end she is practically a slave and also serves as the local whore to all the men in the village as well. She is also chained to an anvil to prevent her escape. She is abused, manipulated and mentally tortured until it appears that she has decided to sacrifice herself completely. I liked this film because I can totally understand where she's coming from. Let me explain. When I was 8 my mother moved us to Tenerife, which is a little Spanish island of the coast of morocco. I was immediately sent to school, where I was bullied and shunned by the entire class. Even by the teachers, whose punishment included kneeling on a cold floor for half an hour etc. You have to understand that it was a very backwards island educational wise. Despite everything, I tried my hardest to be nice and helpful. I never retaliated and put up with their physical and mental abuse for 4 years. I let them walk all over me. It was (like in this film) a very close-knit community that disliked outsiders. Even though I was much taller then them and could have easily pummelled them one by one I was determined to get them to like and except me. Well it never happened and I was forced to leave, but looking back at it now, having been through quite a lot, would I have liked to have all those people that took advantage of me and my feelings killed? Well...yes. In fact if the whole island sank back into the sea I would be ecstatic. So as you can imagine I really enjoyed the end when Grace realizes that some people just can't be saved and orders the whole town to be extinguished and the residents shot. She tried to fool herself into thinking that it wasn't their fault that they were the way they were, that they were just victims of circumstance, which is what I used to tell myself all the time. Kind of like a bad dog, blame the owner right? It doesn't stop the need for the dog to be put down though does it? No, and that's what happens here. I give it 4 stars because I don't think it could stand up to repeated viewing.

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[2, 2]","Mr. von Trier doesn't always make films that appeal to me, but you can be sure he'll get a dynamite performance out of his lead actress, in this case, the magnificent Nicole Kidman. A (sort of) tribute to Thornton Wilder's Our Town, there is no discernable set, some props and some sound effects, but it's basically a tour de force for actors creating a world without the benefit of a real milieu. The actors, all of them, succeed brilliantly. We're not talking about theatre workshop actors; Kidman, Paul Bettany, Lauren Bacall, Jeremy Davies, Chlo&eacute; Sevigny, James Caan, and all involved are in tune with the narrative and the settings don't seem to matter. At 3 hours, it didn't take long to realize that I never noticed anything other than a good story, though it's not always pleasant. Von Trier became my champion after Breaking the Waves, with Emily Watson. After that, I saw Dancer in the Dark, with a brutal story about futility, with a perfect performance from Bjork; I can't watch that film again. After Dogville, I realized that von Trier is mean-spirited and it's good to be cautious. Dogville catches the basic evil in human nature, though it's more about survival than true evil. Any film freak should see Dogville, if only for the experimental novelty. Thanks to a bravura cast, it succeeds on that level. Don't expect laffs 'n stuff because they won't be there. There's also a twist ending that adds a bit to Kidman's extraordinarily complex character. No spoiler: There's something going on with Grace, but she's not talkin'...I heard von Trier has never been to America; if the voice-over didn't say it took place in the Rocky Mountains, I was sure it was more like Appalacia.",4,Lars von Trier: An Acquired Taste?,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,1701,"['Mr.', 'von', 'Trier', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'films', 'appeal', 'can', 'be', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'dynamite', 'performance', 'lead', 'actress', 'case', 'magnificent', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'A', 'sort', 'tribute', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'Town', 'discernable', 'set', 'props', 'sound', 'effects', 'basically', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'actors', 'creating', 'world', 'benefit', 'real', 'milieu', 'actors', 'succeed', 'brilliantly', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'theatre', 'workshop', 'actors', 'Kidman', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Chlo', 'eacute', 'Sevigny', 'James', 'Caan', 'involved', 'are', 'tune', 'narrative', 'settings', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', '3', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realize', 'never', 'noticed', 'anything', 'other', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'always', 'pleasant', 'Von', 'Trier', 'became', 'champion', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'saw', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'brutal', 'story', 'futility', 'perfect', 'performance', 'Bjork', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'Dogville', 'realized', 'von', 'Trier', 'mean-spirited', 'good', 'be', 'cautious', 'Dogville', 'basic', 'evil', 'human', 'nature', 'more', 'survival', 'true', 'evil', 'film', 'freak', 'should', 'see', 'Dogville', 'only', 'experimental', 'novelty', 'Thanks', 'bravura', 'cast', 'level', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'laffs', 'n', 'stuff', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', 'also', 'twist', 'ending', 'bit', 'Kidman', 'extraordinarily', 'complex', 'character', 'spoiler', 'something', 'going', 'Grace', 'not', 'talkin', 'heard', 'von', 'Trier', 'never', 'been', 'America', 'voice-over', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'took', 'place', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'more', 'Appalacia']",N/A

828816,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00029QXAK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Dogville (Lars von Trier, 2003)Lars von Trier has always been, if nothing else, ambitious in the breadth and scope of his films. A quick look at The Kingdom should show that. And Dogville is nothing if not ambitious--a movie whose entire set is a huge chalkboard with lines delineating buildings, a small scattering of props, and a small, controlled stable of top-notch actors. How much can you do with such a minimal setup? Enough to fill a three-hour movie, apparently. And while Dogville isn't the best movie I've seen this year-- hell, it's not the best movie I've seen this week (that honor would have to go to Neil Jordan's fantastic The Butcher Boy)-- but it does its job, and it does it very, very well.Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a woman on the run from gangsters who stumbles into the ramshackle town of Dogville, Colorado. She is found by Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), the town thinker, and he decides to invite her into the close-knot town. After a town meeting, the others decide to give her two weeks, and see if she fits in. She goes to work for them, helping each family in town for an hour a day. As time goes on, however, their demands get stranger and more perverse, and Grace begins to realize that this town, who originally weren't sure if they wanted anything to do with her at all, is now unwilling to let her go...von Trier's set design, which has absolute zero in the way of eye candy, distances the viewer and forces him to concentrate on the actors and their relationships. At times, this can be, well, not the blessing it initially sounds, as all the ugliness at the heart of the town comes out. Because of this, there are parts of the movie than will probably be difficult to watch for those who lack strong stomachs. On the other hand, there's nothing to distract from the caliber of the performances; with a cast that includes Stellan Skarsgard, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan, Ben Gazzara, Udo Kier, Lauren Bacall, and, of course, Kidman and Bettany (and I'm just touching the tip of the iceberg), you can see how such an approach certainly has its upside as well.A great deal has been made of the anti-American sentiment in the film, but I tend to agree with those critics who see the underlying morality of Dogville in a more universal sense; of course it applies to current-day America (and, distressingly, it applies more now than it did at the time of the film's release), but to jump from that to assuming it applies only to America would be a grave mistake. People with the mindset of those in Dogville can be found anywhere, and in any time period; von Trier may not have set out to make a universal film (though for all I know, that's exactly what he intended), but that's how it came out.I admit, once I realized the entire film was going to be shot on the same set as the prologue, I despaired at my ability to stare at chalk outlines for three hours, but I ended up far more impressed than I expected to be. It's a hard film, but a powerful one nonetheless. *** ",4,Interesting experiment that doesn't go too wrong.,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,2999,"['Dogville', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', '2003', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'always', 'been', 'nothing', 'else', 'ambitious', 'breadth', 'scope', 'films', 'quick', 'look', 'Kingdom', 'should', 'show', 'Dogville', 'nothing', 'not', 'ambitious', 'movie', 'entire', 'set', 'huge', 'chalkboard', 'lines', 'delineating', 'buildings', 'small', 'scattering', 'props', 'small', 'controlled', 'stable', 'top-notch', 'actors', 'How', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'minimal', 'setup', 'Enough', 'fill', 'three-hour', 'movie', 'apparently', 'Dogville', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'hell', 'not', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'week', 'honor', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'fantastic', 'Butcher', 'Boy', 'job', 'very', 'very', 'well.Grace', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'woman', 'run', 'gangsters', 'who', 'stumbles', 'ramshackle', 'town', 'Dogville', 'Colorado', 'found', 'Tom', 'Edison', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'town', 'thinker', 'invite', 'close-knot', 'town', 'town', 'meeting', 'others', 'decide', 'give', 'two', 'weeks', 'see', 'work', 'helping', 'family', 'town', 'hour', 'day', 'time', 'however', 'demands', 'get', 'stranger', 'more', 'perverse', 'Grace', 'realize', 'town', 'who', 'originally', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'wanted', 'anything', 'do', 'now', 'unwilling', 'let', 'go', 'von', 'Trier', 'set', 'design', 'absolute', 'zero', 'way', 'eye', 'candy', 'viewer', 'forces', 'concentrate', 'actors', 'relationships', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'well', 'not', 'blessing', 'initially', 'ugliness', 'heart', 'town', 'out', 'are', 'parts', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'difficult', 'watch', 'who', 'lack', 'strong', 'stomachs', 'other', 'hand', 'nothing', 'distract', 'caliber', 'performances', 'cast', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'James', 'Caan', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'course', 'Kidman', 'Bettany', ""'m"", 'just', 'touching', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'such', 'approach', 'certainly', 'upside', 'well.A', 'great', 'deal', 'been', 'made', 'anti-American', 'sentiment', 'film', 'tend', 'agree', 'critics', 'who', 'see', 'underlying', 'morality', 'Dogville', 'more', 'universal', 'sense', 'course', 'current-day', 'America', 'distressingly', 'more', 'now', 'did', 'time', 'film', 'release', 'jump', 'assuming', 'only', 'America', 'would', 'be', 'grave', 'mistake', 'People', 'mindset', 'Dogville', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'time', 'period', 'Trier', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'universal', 'film', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'intended', 'how', 'came', 'out.I', 'admit', 'once', 'realized', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'shot', 'same', 'set', 'prologue', 'despaired', 'ability', 'stare', 'chalk', 'outlines', 'three', 'hours', 'ended', 'up', 'far', 'more', 'impressed', 'expected', 'be', 'hard', 'film', 'powerful', 'one', 'nonetheless', '***']",N/A

828822,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00029QXAK,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 15]","Lars Von Trier's ""Dogville"" is ""Our Town"" for the clinically depressed, exploring the dark underbelly of rural Americana in ways that Thornton Wilder never even imagined.  Like Wilder, Von Trier utilizes a fictional small town to reveal profound truths about human nature, although Von Trier`s revelations are far more sinister and despairing than any Wilder came up with.Dogville is a sleepy little hamlet nestled high up in the Colorado Rockies.  The simple folk there lead lives of humdrum monotony, undisturbed by the troubles and vicissitudes of the outside world.  One day, a mysterious and beautiful young woman - allegorically named Grace - is found wandering in the town.  When it is discovered that she is fleeing some mobsters, the townspeople reluctantly agree to hide her and let her become a member of their community.  At first all goes well, with Grace winning over the hearts of the citizens and even bringing a measure of previously unknown joy into their lives.  However, slowly the mood turns sinister, as the denizens begin to exploit, then sexually and psychologically abuse the delicate young woman.  Von Trier makes the case that even the most seemingly benign, mild-mannered individual will, if given half a chance, lord it over someone who is weaker and more vulnerable than he is.  The final hour of the film has much of the feel of Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery,"" as Grace becomes the expiatory sacrifice for the sinful folk who live in the town - until, that is, the tables are turned on them.Because the story is essentially a morality play and a parable, Von Trier has chosen to make the film on a stark soundstage, with chalk lines substituting for walls and only the barest minimum of d&eacute;cor suggesting an actual town.  Only the sound effects - such as the opening and closing of invisible doors - is entirely realistic.  (A TV movie version of ""Our Town"" in the 1970's utilized this same technique).Although, as a conceit, ""Dogville"" is intriguing enough in its early stages, after about the first hour or so - and it runs for almost three! - the movie begins to severely outstay its welcome.  Once the novelty of the stage-bound approach wears off, we are left with a pretty silly story in which the characters act in ways that are not merely inscrutable but downright maddening.  We begin to wonder what the point of it all is after awhile.  If Von Trier is trying to say that small town Americana is really not all Norman Rockwell sweetness-and-light, that theme has been explored countless times before, and in works far less contrived and pretentious than this one.  The tone of self-importance that permeates the film is reflected in the dividing up of the tale into nine ""chapters"" - replete with fancy title cards - and the use of a droning, hoity-toity narrator (more shades of ""Our Town"") whose main function seems to be to point out the obvious.As Grace, Nicole Kidman does an effective job portraying an essentially passive victim, although we spend most of our time wanting to see her deck all those sadistic idiots with whom she comes into daily contact.

Rasband,"[33, 66]","""Dogville"" is one of the most excruciatingly boring movies you will ever see; it has a brutal three-hour running time that will have you feeling every minute of it.  Add to this an ignorant, stridently anti-American theme and you really have a dog on your hands.  ""Von"" Trier (I use quotation marks because as the critic John Simon has correctly pointed out there are no ""von""'s in Denmark, the director's home country: the ""von"" is just an affectation he uses to seem more aristocratic) has never visited America.  He obviously has no idea what this country is like.  The massacre which closes this movie reminds one of the Nazi SS killing squads that roamed Europe just a few years after this movie supposedly takes place, and from which American troops saved ""von"" Trier's grandparents.  Similar massacres are of course common in European history and unheard of at a similar time in America.  Nothing in this movie rings true.  Americans generally treat each other with an informal respect and friendliness, which is a far cry from the behavior in this movie.  The airy, abstact dialogue bears no resemblance to real speech between actual people; it sounds like the bad dialogue in an awful book that the character Tom, Jr. would write.  And the strange relationship between the Edisons and the rest of the town makes no sense in an American context; it's like the Edison's are feudal lords or something.  So the movie turns out not to be a representation of America at all, but an inane fantasy of a confused European intellectual.  And the closing credits are the final straw.  Anyone can assemble degrading pictures of any country and set them to ironic music; it's no great trick.  Hell, I'll bet there's even some poor people in Denmark, too.  On the DVD commentary track, ""von"" Trier dismisses criticism of the closing credits, simply saying ""they are facts.  You can't criticize facts.""  As if there is no inherent bias in the very act of selecting the pictures you choose to show.  (And seldom have I heard a more pompous, pleased-with-himself commentary track as this one.)  I can't believe I ever defended ""Breaking the Waves"" to people.  The director should check his own continent's history of collaboration with fascism before hurling stones at the U.S.  I guess Nicole Kidman's ""Grace"" is supposed to be a Christ figure; if so ""von"" Trier should read the New Testament scripture about being unable to remove the mote in your neighbor's eye because of the beam that is in your own.",1,"Check The Beam In Your Own Eye, ""Von"" Trier",1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,2497,"['Dogville', 'one', 'most', 'excruciatingly', 'boring', 'movies', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'brutal', 'three-hour', 'running', 'time', 'will', 'have', 'feeling', 'minute', 'Add', 'ignorant', 'stridently', 'anti-American', 'theme', 'really', 'have', 'dog', 'hands', 'Von', 'Trier', 'use', 'quotation', 'marks', 'critic', 'John', 'Simon', 'correctly', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'von', 'Denmark', 'director', 'home', 'country', 'von', 'just', 'affectation', 'seem', 'more', 'aristocratic', 'never', 'visited', 'America', 'obviously', 'idea', 'what', 'country', 'massacre', 'movie', 'one', 'Nazi', 'SS', 'killing', 'squads', 'roamed', 'Europe', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'place', 'American', 'saved', 'von', 'Trier', 'grandparents', 'Similar', 'massacres', 'are', 'course', 'common', 'European', 'history', 'unheard', 'similar', 'time', 'America', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'true', 'Americans', 'generally', 'treat', 'other', 'informal', 'respect', 'friendliness', 'far', 'cry', 'behavior', 'movie', 'airy', 'abstact', 'dialogue', 'resemblance', 'real', 'speech', 'actual', 'people', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'awful', 'book', 'character', 'Tom', 'Jr.', 'would', 'write', 'strange', 'relationship', 'Edisons', 'rest', 'town', 'sense', 'American', 'context', 'Edison', 'are', 'feudal', 'lords', 'something', 'movie', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'representation', 'America', 'inane', 'fantasy', 'confused', 'European', 'intellectual', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'final', 'straw', 'Anyone', 'can', 'assemble', 'degrading', 'pictures', 'country', 'set', 'ironic', 'music', 'great', 'trick', 'Hell', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'even', 'poor', 'people', 'Denmark', 'too', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'von', 'Trier', 'criticism', 'closing', 'credits', 'simply', 'saying', 'are', 'facts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'criticize', 'facts', 'inherent', 'bias', 'very', 'act', 'selecting', 'pictures', 'choose', 'show', 'seldom', 'have', 'heard', 'more', 'pompous', 'pleased-with-himself', 'commentary', 'track', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ever', 'defended', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'people', 'director', 'should', 'check', 'own', 'continent', 'history', 'collaboration', 'fascism', 'hurling', 'stones', 'U.S', 'guess', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Grace', 'supposed', 'be', 'Christ', 'figure', 'von', 'Trier', 'should', 'read', 'New', 'Testament', 'scripture', 'being', 'unable', 'remove', 'mote', 'neighbor', 'eye', 'beam', 'own']",N/A

I feel such paranoid jibes completely miss the point: although Dogville is set in a fictional village in the Rockies during the Depression-era, it really could be any place, any time. It is anti-human-ugliness. The tagline reads ""A quiet little town not far from here"", and the sparse stage set reinforces that point. The viewer's imagination is meant to fill in the gaps, making Dogville their home town for nearly three hours.The theme veers around Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives, seeking shelter from pursuing gangsters, the natives are reluctant to help. With the assistance of a local 'philosopher' (played by Paul Bettany), she eventually persuades the inhabitants to relent, and they grant her a two week trial period. During the fortnight, she manages to win the villagers over by performing good deeds, but gradually they begin to take advantage of her kindness and the rot sets in.This is an extremely long film, but it is definitely worth the effort. It is an allegory of staggering proportions, it deals with virtually every aspect of humanity and some of the most fundamental questions people can face, whilst maintaining a lightness of touch that makes the mental workout more than bearable.

828833,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B00029QXAK,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[2, 11]","I just finished this film. I was completely polorized by the ending. Very powerful, and extremely provocative. It brings a lot of thoughts to the surface, like: Did the people of Dogville deserve the punishment that they recieved? Were their crimes that extreme? Of course, Grace went through a lot. She was raped by almost every man in the village, chained, forced to do odd jobs around the town for little pay and hardly any respect, humiliated and wrongly accused, and betrayed by the one and only person who she thought she could trust. Thats a lot for one person to carry, but throughout the film, Grace seems to maintain a forgiving spirit to the extreme. She is always willing to look past these horrible things, move on with her life, and keep the peace. Her name, Grace, is probably symbolic of this.Later on in the film, we see a change in Grace. This forgiving attitude seems to be fading away, and human nature is taking over. This is something that stuck with me. Can one person, besides Jesus Christ, be THIS forgiving? Sometime or another, you're gonna explode or act in a way that you never thought you would, abandoning all of your previous beliefs and attitudes. Eventually, we find out that Grace's daddy is a mob boss, and she is given the chance to join him or to go on with her life, possibly to stay in Dogville and start anew. Then she realizes that she CAN have revenge. It is her right, and the people of Dogville deserve every bit of it. Grace is a whole different person here, and its very disturbing to watch. She orders her father to send out his team of mobsters and massacre the entire village, including the children. In my humble opinion, the children should have been spared, but this goes to show the lengths Grace was willing to go to in order to get back at the town. No harm comes to the dog, however.To me, this film was an amazing character study about human nature. What forces us to turn on each other? Why is it so hard to accept others who are different from us? Can we find it in ourselves to forgive others, even when they have caused us extreme pain in the worst way possible? Or will our natural desire to get revenge and take matters into our own hands get the best of us?

When describing his body of work, phrases such as ""an assault on the senses"" and ""an unrelenting test of one's endurance"" oftentimes are used.  ""Dogville"" is no exception.  It is at the same time a bold piece of experimental storytelling and a daring creation of a mad visionary.  How many films can you say that about?A mysterious woman named Grace Margaret Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) enters the town of Dogville looking for a safe haven from pursuing gangsters.  A young man named Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) convinces the townspeople to hide Grace despite the danger to their own personal safety.  A friendly relationship develops between the denizens of Dogville and the woman on the run but matters soon turn sinister.  Knowing of Grace's vulnerable situation, the townspeople start to increase their physical and psychological exploitation of her.  Then one fateful night, Grace's past catches up with her as a limousine pulls into Dogville and changes the destiny of every inhabitant of the small town forever.Watching a film that is 177 minutes long is an exhausting experience no matter what the film may be.  If the 177 minute film being watched is a Lars von Trier film, then consider yourself lucky if your sanity is still intact once the film is over.  ""Dogville"" is not for the weak of mind or the weak of heart.  In fact, it is not for anyone who is expecting a conventional film even if you are using the most liberal definition of the term ""conventional film.""  ""Dogville"" will literally break your mind if you have not been previously exposed to Lars von Trier's earlier works and have not developed a tolerance towards his unique filmmaking style.  Yet, despite all of the havoc this film may wreak on your well-being, ""Dogville"" is a triumph of sorts.  It is audacious and brave.  It is filled with damning and insightful commentary on social dynamics and human nature.  It is a film that will linger in your mind for days on end as the characters brought to life by Kidman, Bettany, Lauren Bacall, Patricia Clarkson, Jeremy Davies, Philip Baker Hall, Chlo Sevigny, Stellan Skarsgrd, and James Caan will continue to haunt your thoughts.

The acting and script are decent at best - I think von Trier did everything in one take and didn't care how wooden or emotionless the acting was as long as he had the shot. The use of the narrator is such a lazy thing to do - a director should show the audience what the characters are thinking and feeling, not tell them. I don't have a qualm with narrations if used only a few brief times in a film. Dogville uses narration very frequently and for no real reason other than Lars von Trier didn't feel like showing (or couldn't figure out how to show) the audience what is happening. The editing is dreadful. There are random jump cuts that exist for no reason (unlike, say, Traffic or Memento where the jump cuts make sense or at least look awesome).

Well despite its near 3-hour length, Dogville had me glued to my seat throughout. This morality play with its Brechtian approach to staging and props works magnificently. Far from being distracted or annoyed by its minimalism, I actually found that being able to see some of the goings-on in other parts of the town when the focus was in one particular house only added to the film's emotional impact, and what an impact it has - the first rape scene being a spectacular case in point. The fact that the performances are pitch perfect doesn't hurt either; Nicole Kidman is in career-best form.

Its very suspicious of outsiders but with a simple tummy rub everyone can be won over and accepted. The film is book ended with the bark of a dog. The dog you see, doesn't exist, he is merely a chalk outline on the floor of a sound stage. Using a minimal amount of props Von Trier creates a town  where everyone is very secretive, yet ironically enough their homes are out in the open for all to see inside.Von Trier asks alot from his audience, its up to you to fill in the gaps. Actors close and open doors that simply are not there, but it is your mind that makes it real. In the span of three hour this strange little town will both pass judgement and be judged themselves. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a woman on the run from gangsters. She ends up in Dogville where she meets a small town of simple town people. The movie chooses to linger and lets you soak in the rich dialogue and accurate performances. Unlike Von Triers previous effort (Dancer in the Dark) this time he lets events happen naturally. Instead of feeling the forced hand of the script making lives miserable, it is characters who act out of instinct that is the driving force through out the movie. They turn from kind to mean very gradually and all the clues are scattered through out nine chapters.This Dog has quite a bite and Grace learns this the hard way. The many rich layers of thought have lingered in my mind and I eagerly wish to watch the movie again and catch all the subtle ideas I may have missed the first time around. If there is any criticism in this movie about America, I don't think I would disagree with any of it. I think America is best symbolized by the blind man, who refuses to admit he's blind, and foolishly thinks that no one else has noticed his loss of sight. To criticize the world, is not to disown it, but if we do not admit our loss of sight, than we truly have grown old, stubborn and cold.Dogville is one of the best films of the year and the first Lars Von Trier film that I truly think works from beginning to end.

Critics found a miraculous way to label it ""anti-american"" (funniest thing I've heard about a film in ages) whereas Dogville is about a town anywhere on the globe. Others suggested that it's a pointlessly bleak film when anyone with a functioning brain should easily recognise how ultra-realistic this film actually is..And on and on...But this is how humans are. Once we have to be confronted with the not-so great side of our nature we tend to be evasive. We tend to invent excuses. Lie if we have to. And our not-so great nature turns even uglier. There's no limit to our ugliness just as there could be no limit to our goodness if we somehow found a way to be honest about what we are.But Dogville's premise, no matter how you cut it, is undeniable: humans when given power over someone will more than likely exploit him, beat him, humiliate him, dehumanise him. And that's the good scenario. Power corrupts and it corrupts totally.As a seemingly hunted woman arrives at a remote and isolated town, the powers of the human psyche go into full effect. The town goes into council and decides to take this woman under its wings recognising -albeit not admitting it- that there is much to be gained here. Everybody has a small little agenda to run. That agenda can take all kinds of different colours: it might a sexual one, it might be a workwise exploitative one, or it might be a ""well, lets see what good this can be for me"" one. All of the agendas together are in their essence perverse and malevolent.As the story progresses things turn uglier. And uglier. The director and scriptwriter relentlessly follow the lead they've set up. The fate of the ""protected"" woman becomes darker and darker right infront of your eyes whether this might mean rape, utter degradation, daily devaluation of dignity, or whatever else you could think of that would drive the less endurable from us to suicide under such circumstances.But the female-protagonist of the story hangs on. And it's a mystery really for the audience why she does, especially as the films stretches for 3 hours while it seems that the longer she allows herself to stay into this environment of sick intentions she might not even come through it alive. The more suspicious of the audience might sense that she has an agenda as well. If so, it's one you wont suspect, until the end of the film thrusts forward and hits you with a vengeance no other film could claim.And long after you've taken your eyes off the screen, Dogville will keep lingering annoyingly in your mind. Is this what we are? And do we deserve what Dogville shows as a resolution to its story? The answer is not comfortable.Dogville is simply an unparallel masterpiece. On any level a film could judged. The acting is absolutely stunning and this not only from Nicole Kidman who gives the performance of a lifetime but from everyone else in the cast, even the characters who speak a mere few lines. I cant think of another film where there's such an overwhelming series of great performances from such a diverse and quite big cast.This still takes second seat though to the strikingly effective directing of Lars von Triers. It's a stroke of genius really. He didn't need a huge budget to make Dogville what it is, because he only needed the actors. Literally. The walls are missing from Dogville. The set is basically a design on the floor, made so that everything could be stripped bare of any element hiding it. So it's allegorigal and straightforward simoultaneously. The effect of this is gripping.Easily one of the most intelligent, cynical, human and brutal films ever made, Dogville has gained a place way high in the pantheon of great movies. Its reputation is only destined to grow once the last superficial critiques fade away as well. It's destined to be recognised for its message and for the incredible work for art that it is.As far as films about the human condition go, this is the film to end all films.",5,Possibly the most realistic film about humans ever...,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,4146,"['thing', 'Dogville', 'caused', 'stir', 'even', 'made', 'theaters', 'continued', 'do', 'so', 'hit', 'screens', 'wont', 'stop', 'long-long', 'time', 'Critics', 'found', 'miraculous', 'way', 'label', 'anti-american', 'funniest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'film', 'ages', 'whereas', 'Dogville', 'town', 'anywhere', 'globe', 'Others', 'suggested', 'pointlessly', 'bleak', 'film', 'when', 'anyone', 'functioning', 'brain', 'should', 'easily', 'recognise', 'how', 'ultra-realistic', 'film', 'actually', 'is..And', 'how', 'humans', 'are', 'have', 'be', 'confronted', 'not-so', 'great', 'side', 'nature', 'tend', 'be', 'evasive', 'tend', 'invent', 'excuses', 'Lie', 'have', 'not-so', 'great', 'nature', 'even', 'uglier', 'limit', 'ugliness', 'just', 'could', 'be', 'limit', 'goodness', 'somehow', 'found', 'way', 'be', 'honest', 'what', 'are.But', 'Dogville', 'premise', 'matter', 'how', 'cut', 'undeniable', 'humans', 'when', 'given', 'power', 'someone', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'exploit', 'beat', 'humiliate', 'dehumanise', 'good', 'scenario', 'Power', 'corrupts', 'seemingly', 'hunted', 'woman', 'remote', 'isolated', 'town', 'powers', 'human', 'psyche', 'go', 'full', 'effect', 'town', 'council', 'take', 'woman', 'wings', 'recognising', 'not', 'admitting', 'it-', 'much', 'be', 'gained', 'here', 'Everybody', 'small', 'little', 'agenda', 'run', 'agenda', 'can', 'take', 'kinds', 'different', 'colours', 'might', 'sexual', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'workwise', 'exploitative', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'well', 'lets', 'see', 'what', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'agendas', 'together', 'are', 'essence', 'perverse', 'malevolent.As', 'story', 'things', 'turn', 'uglier', 'uglier', 'director', 'scriptwriter', 'relentlessly', 'follow', 'lead', ""'ve"", 'set', 'up', 'fate', 'protected', 'woman', 'darker', 'darker', 'right', 'infront', 'eyes', 'might', 'mean', 'rape', 'utter', 'degradation', 'daily', 'devaluation', 'dignity', 'else', 'could', 'think', 'would', 'drive', 'less', 'endurable', 'suicide', 'such', 'circumstances.But', 'female-protagonist', 'story', 'hangs', 'mystery', 'really', 'audience', 'why', 'especially', 'films', 'stretches', '3', 'hours', 'longer', 'stay', 'environment', 'sick', 'intentions', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'alive', 'more', 'suspicious', 'audience', 'might', 'sense', 'agenda', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'one', 'wont', 'suspect', 'end', 'film', 'forward', 'hits', 'vengeance', 'other', 'film', 'could', 'claim.And', 'long', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'eyes', 'screen', 'Dogville', 'will', 'keep', 'lingering', 'annoyingly', 'mind', 'what', 'are', 'do', 'deserve', 'what', 'Dogville', 'resolution', 'story', 'answer', 'not', 'comfortable.Dogville', 'simply', 'unparallel', 'masterpiece', 'level', 'film', 'could', 'judged', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'not', 'only', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'even', 'characters', 'who', 'speak', 'mere', 'few', 'lines', 'cant', 'think', 'film', 'where', 'such', 'overwhelming', 'series', 'great', 'performances', 'such', 'diverse', 'quite', 'big', 'cast.This', 'still', 'second', 'seat', 'strikingly', 'effective', 'directing', 'Lars', 'von', 'Triers', 'stroke', 'genius', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'huge', 'budget', 'make', 'Dogville', 'what', 'only', 'needed', 'actors', 'Literally', 'walls', 'are', 'missing', 'Dogville', 'set', 'basically', 'design', 'floor', 'made', 'so', 'everything', 'could', 'be', 'stripped', 'bare', 'element', 'hiding', 'allegorigal', 'straightforward', 'simoultaneously', 'effect', 'gripping.Easily', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'cynical', 'human', 'brutal', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Dogville', 'gained', 'place', 'way', 'high', 'pantheon', 'great', 'movies', 'reputation', 'only', 'destined', 'grow', 'once', 'last', 'superficial', 'critiques', 'fade', 'away', 'as', 'well', 'destined', 'be', 'recognised', 'message', 'incredible', 'work', 'art', 'far', 'films', 'human', 'condition', 'go', 'film', 'end', 'films']",N/A

Anytime you try something truly different, there will and should be backlash.When considering all of this, its immensely important to remember that just because something is different does not meanits good, valuable, or necessary. Enter Dogville. This film is certainly something to behold and if you have watched it, for better or worse, you know what I mean.  If you have not watched in yet, take the entire experience with a grain of salt. Watching this film is a test of endurance, but there are certainly valuable aspects to the journey. Dogville is story telling. It harkens back to classical elements of story telling on a number of levels. If you have a high appreciation for classical literature and stage plays, you are heading in the right direction. Dogville has no special effects, limited editing, and a very scarce set. The entire presentation is mostly very raw and essentially uncooked. The human emotion is put on center stage. The question is how raw of human emotion is truly needed? Lars Von Trier attempts to answer that questions through art and experimentation.Don't be mistaken, this is not a traditional film. This is essentially a filmed stage play told with a prologue and chapters.Dogville tells the story a very small mountain town of Dogville, Colorado. One random night, a mysterious girl named Grace (Nicole Kidman) runs into the town. She is running from gangsters and gun fire.  One of the towns people named Thomas Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany) decides to try and take her in from harm's way. The town votes to shelter her in exchange for physical labor.This all seems really innocent at first. As it turns out, this seemingly pleasant town turns out to the twilight zone.Dogville is long and the story takes many curves. Watch this with an open mind, be patient, and you will find something that surprises you.Overall, you have to commend Von Trier for attempting something bold and different.Does it work at all?

828847,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B00029QXAK,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[7, 12]","I give Nicole Kidman credit for being brave enough to take this role. They couldn't have paid her much--this film appears to have had a budget of about $100--so she certainly didn't do it for the money. Maybe after making such movies as Practical Magic and The Peacemaker she wanted once again to show the world she's a serious actress. She is. But this pretentious film is not worthy of her. Danish Director Lars von Trier does not like America or Americans and he is not shy about it. I'm not adverse to criticizing the U.S., but I find his critique in this film to be overly broad, overly general, woefully unsubtle and completely uninsightful. It's as if he's just discovered for the first time that people--especially isolated people--can be suspicious, small-minded and hypocritical, and now he wants to share this revelation with the world.  Guess what, Larsie?  --We know!Specifically, the small-town of von Trier's Dogville could be any small town anywhere--the Bavarian Alps, the Russian Steppes, an African village, an intolerant fundamentalist Islamic society. People everywhere are suspicious and generally maintain a pack mentality--that's how humanity has gotten into everything from the Iraq debacle to the crucifixion of Christ to the rise of Nazism to the mutilation of infant genitals. But von Trier doesn't go beyond this very simple ""exploration"" to find anything unique about Dogville, or America, or anything in this movie that makes it more than a broad and unfocused diatribe against...everything, really, while at the same time against nothing. Most of us learn about the cheerful hypocracy of the world (and not just America) when we are in our teens. For von Trier to step in and tell us--with verbose subtitles preceding each scene no less--this information is pretension with a capital P. For him to drive home his simplistic and simple message over and over again throughout three of the slowest hours in recent movie memory (""I wondered if my watch had stopped,"" says Roger Ebert in his review) is self-indulgence, not art, not a penetrating and powerful cinematic experience.Most of all the director seemed to be mad at everyone and everything.  Anger in art certainly isn't a bad thing, but unforcused anger is, and the ""message"" here, while obvious, is at the same time not very clearly targeted.  We flail at the world when we're a rebellious 16, but then we grow up, or most of us do.  By the time we're 30 we hopefully realize we're not impressing everybody by wearing shredded jeans, chain-smoking, not bathing, and telling everyone who walks by how much the world sucks.The cast is as good as can be expected, and Kidman occasionally even transcends her circumstances; the ideas for set design are interesting. Nicole Kidman deserves credit for allowing herself to be degraded with repeated rape and sodomy scenes, a stint where she wears a metal collar with a leash secured to a heavy iron wheel, and everything else short of water-dunking torture. Subtle this movie ain't.The DVD looks excellent, without even slight nicks because the movie was shot on video and only later transferred to film. There's a commentary track but I didn't listen to it. This is supposedly the first film in a trilogy that's supposed to be all about how awful America is. But there's nothing to learn about America here--a country von Trier has never even visited. As I've stated in other reviews, often Europeans have a good clear-eyed vision of America with all its virtues and flaws, as they can often see things in our culture that we cannot, due to our proximity and their distance. Such is not the case here, however. There is nothing to learn in Dogville--about America, the nature of hypocracy, or anything else other than how to be arty and long-winded about it.

828849,A3VZ4LAHI144EC,B00029QXAK,"tomato cow ""JSC""","[5, 7]","This is about as far away as one can get from a 'feel good' flick, yet it is undeniably powerful and delivers a most difficult subject to ponder that really is one of the central themes to the human experience: the delicate balance between good and evil and how one navigates in the waters of extreme polarity. Director Lars von Trier has created a uniquely affecting tale that is played out on a single soundstage with only the most basic of non-human elements so that the focus can be exclusively on the relationships of the people in 'Dogville'. And it is this intense development of the dynamics of the character's interactions that makes this film the powerful statement it is.What we see in the gradually developing story of Dogville is how noble traits such as good intentions, giving, forgiveness and long suffering - when taken to the extreme - can actually empower evil and destroy oneself. It seems to me the message in this film is that self love is equally important as love for others. And so, we are taught an important lesson of Balance here. This issue comes to a dramatic pinnacle with Grace's conversation with her gangster-boss father (James Caan) near the end of the film in the back of his limo. They both represent arrogance in polarized opposite ways: hers of the lightside; his of the dark.In the end, Grace chooses to 'balance the scales' in order to find her own peace and resolution for the horrors inflicted upon her. We witness karmic debt being cancelled as Dogville goes up in flames. In my sense of fairness, it couldn't have ended any other way, and be truthful. I say this not to condone the actions she ultimately chooses here: the movie is what it is. It's a lesson in just how out of balance one can become in trying to 'love' others that we actually become that which we hate: In Grace's case, her altruism taken to the extreme ultimately transforms her into violent retribution. We are left to speculate that she could have created a much different and more humane outcome simply by not allowing herself to become the doormat for all those who did indeed exploit her. That would have not been possible unless she played the role she played. Had she embraced more self respect and defined her boundaries, the nasty outcome would most probably have been aborted entirely. What we see played out here is the natural result of embracing extremes of polarity. The truth (and sanity) lies in a healthy balance between the two.This is a most unique and thought-provocative film about what it means to be human and live in the cosmic soup of good and evil that we find ourselves in. I believe that most people desire to be good and kind to their neighbor. However, there are healthy limits to how much abuse one can take and if we do not also be kind to ourselves, we are out of balance and we end up with a mini (or major)-Dogville on our hands. This is an issue that is central to everyone's life to some degree and one we must all come to resolution with eventually. In contemplating this further, was it not her own fear that inspired her playing the role of doormat? She wanted to 'be saved'. THAT was her foundational error.Nicole Kidman's acting in this film is probably the best of her career. She is convincing as the archetypical altruistic martyr as she continually chooses to overlook the bad behaviour of those around her, making allowances for their 'weaknesses' and deliberately forgives those who exploit her. Excellent also is Paul Bettany as Tom, who is also an archetype of an all too common character: seemingly kind and good-hearted at first, but when push comes to shove is revealed to be a weak, spineless, self-serving wimp with no real integrity. With Tom, goodness is really all just 'appearance'. There are many archetypes of dysfunctional humans in this film... it is indeed a cross section of humanity. (May God have mercy on us all). Director Trier developes all characters with equal skill as he weaves the tale in layer upon layer of psychological intrigue.This film is not easy to watch, for it's really a study of the dark side of humanity. But I think it is a necessary one. It is also a rather long film, and it did take me a little while for it to grab and sustain my attention, due to the unorthodox 'theatrical' setting which took some getting used to just because it so 'different'. But due to the many excellent reviews here I persevered and I'm glad I did for once I allowed myself to become part of the Dogville world, I was quite affected. Dogville reveals itself to be a powerful metaphor for the entire world and all of humanity. Yes, we indeed live in a realm of the predator and the prey, and it seems the thing that matters most is not the ultimate outcome but how we choose to navigate our way through the treacherous waters: how fairly we treat ourselves, as equally as how fairly we treat others.Substance worth pondering indeed.",5,Disturbingly Brilliant Expose of the Dance of Polarity,1239148800,"04 8,

828852,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00029QXAK,Tsuyoshi,"[14, 20]","WARNING.  WHAT YOU SEE in ""Dogville"" is very strange.  The town of ""Dogville"" is made with only the minimal sets and props, put on the darkly-lit soundstage.  The ""houses"" have no walls or doors; the ""streets"" are just the white lines drawn on the ground with the name in between; and even the dog is represented by the white drawing with ""DOG"" beside it.  The film thus looks like a stage drama, and you are watching it through the camera on the stage.  And the film, shot with a hand-held DV camera, goes as much as three hours.  Prepare for that.THE STORY is based on a brief scene in a Brecht drama, ""Threepenny Opera,"" but just forget about it.  ""Dogville"" follows a female fugitive named Grace (Nicole Kidman), who seeks for a hiding place in the small town of Dogville.  A young wannabe writer Tom is the first to help her, but he and Grace have to get the approval from all the townspeople to let her stay.  As if in a game, it is decided that Grace has to win the favor of the people by doing whatever she can do for them, the chores for starters.Grace does it, and finally can live in the community, but as she stays longer there, the locals starts to want more from her, never being satisfied with what she offers, and the film leads them to the ending full of impact.  About the rest of the film, you should see for yourself; either you are enthralled with it, or utterly shocked and disgusted.ABOUT THE CAST; the cast is unanimously good, and the names here are quite impressive.  Paul Bettany (as Tom), Chloe Sevigny, Lauren Bacall, Patricia Clarkson, Ben Gazzara, Jeremy Davies, Stellan Skarsgard, Philip Baker Hall, Harriet Andersson, and Blair Brown.  You also see the regular of the director Lars von Trier, Udo Kier and Jean Marc Barr as cameo, plus James Caan whose role reminds us of one Coppola film he was in.  John Hurt also provides the narration.THE DIRECTOR LARS VON TRIER is famous for the dark contents of his films -- see ""Breaking the Waves"" or particularly ""Dancers in the Dark"" -- and he doesn't seem to have changed.  ""Dogville"" is full of such elements that would make you hate the human beings, and moreover, is supposed to be the first part of director's trilogy about America.  (Which means two more are coming....)  However, to be fair, the ""Dogville"" can be anywhere in the world, having the universal theme on the darker side of humans.  The point is, either you like it or not, which I would be never sure of.  If you dislike it, keep this in mind; Lars von Trier has never been to America in his life, and the ""America"" is his America.  (In fact ""Dogville"" was shot in Sweden.)THE CONTENTS are strongly presented, and the acting of Nicole Kidman is brilliant, but the three hours is certainly too long; besides, we have too many words which do not always work.  Actually, it is the fine acting of the cast that drive the story forth with considerable emotioal power, and though the each character's development is far from smooth (especially the relation between Grace and Tom is weakly drawn), each sequence is effectively shown with ardently done works from everyone.Look at this film as you do at theatre.  ""Dogville"" requires your patience, but to many who wants to see thought-provoking or challenging film, this is rewarding experience.  But don't you ever expect from Nicole Kidman's name love or romance,  They are least likely to be found in this town.",4,A Female Fugitive in Town; Explore the Dark Side of Humans,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,3404,"['WARNING', 'WHAT', 'YOU', 'SEE', 'Dogville', 'very', 'strange', 'town', 'Dogville', 'made', 'only', 'minimal', 'sets', 'props', 'put', 'darkly-lit', 'soundstage', 'houses', 'have', 'walls', 'doors', 'streets', 'are', 'just', 'white', 'lines', 'drawn', 'ground', 'name', 'even', 'dog', 'represented', 'white', 'drawing', 'DOG', 'film', 'thus', 'stage', 'drama', 'are', 'watching', 'camera', 'stage', 'film', 'shot', 'hand-held', 'DV', 'camera', 'as', 'much', 'three', 'hours', 'Prepare', 'that.THE', 'STORY', 'based', 'brief', 'scene', 'Brecht', 'drama', 'Threepenny', 'Opera', 'just', 'forget', 'Dogville', 'female', 'fugitive', 'named', 'Grace', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'hiding', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'Dogville', 'A', 'young', 'wannabe', 'writer', 'Tom', 'first', 'help', 'Grace', 'have', 'get', 'approval', 'townspeople', 'let', 'stay', 'game', 'decided', 'Grace', 'win', 'favor', 'people', 'doing', 'can', 'do', 'chores', 'starters.Grace', 'finally', 'can', 'live', 'community', 'longer', 'locals', 'starts', 'want', 'more', 'never', 'being', 'satisfied', 'what', 'film', 'ending', 'full', 'impact', 'rest', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'are', 'enthralled', 'utterly', 'shocked', 'disgusted.ABOUT', 'THE', 'CAST', 'cast', 'unanimously', 'good', 'names', 'here', 'are', 'quite', 'impressive', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Tom', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Harriet', 'Andersson', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'also', 'see', 'regular', 'director', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'Jean', 'Marc', 'Barr', 'cameo', 'James', 'Caan', 'role', 'one', 'Coppola', 'film', 'was', 'John', 'Hurt', 'also', 'narration.THE', 'DIRECTOR', 'LARS', 'VON', 'TRIER', 'famous', 'dark', 'contents', 'films', 'see', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'particularly', 'Dancers', 'Dark', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'changed', 'Dogville', 'full', 'such', 'elements', 'would', 'make', 'hate', 'human', 'beings', 'moreover', 'supposed', 'be', 'first', 'part', 'director', 'trilogy', 'America', 'Which', 'two', 'more', 'are', 'coming', 'However', 'be', 'fair', 'Dogville', 'can', 'be', 'anywhere', 'world', 'having', 'universal', 'theme', 'darker', 'side', 'humans', 'point', 'either', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'never', 'sure', 'dislike', 'keep', 'mind', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'never', 'been', 'America', 'life', 'America', 'America', 'fact', 'Dogville', 'was', 'shot', 'Sweden', 'CONTENTS', 'are', 'strongly', 'presented', 'acting', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'brilliant', 'three', 'hours', 'certainly', 'too', 'long', 'besides', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'words', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'work', 'Actually', 'fine', 'acting', 'cast', 'drive', 'story', 'forth', 'considerable', 'emotioal', 'power', 'character', 'development', 'far', 'smooth', 'especially', 'relation', 'Grace', 'Tom', 'weakly', 'drawn', 'sequence', 'effectively', 'shown', 'ardently', 'done', 'everyone.Look', 'film', 'do', 'theatre', 'Dogville', 'patience', 'many', 'who', 'see', 'thought-provoking', 'challenging', 'film', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'expect', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'name', 'love', 'romance', 'are', 'least', 'likely', 'be', 'found', 'town']",N/A

Marshall,"[5, 9]","This film is actually presented as a play with chalkboard homes and an entire invisible town created on a soundstage but it is still an indispensable look into the psyche of humanity.The town of Dogville exists during the depression era and is nestled deep into the Rocky Mountains, away from prying eyes and the influence of ""civil"" society. It is here that we meet Grace (Nicole Kidman) a mysterious woman who stumbles into town looking for acceptance. The moral influence of the town is Tom (Paul Bettany) and it is in him that Grace seeks refuge. The townspeople are presented with a dilemma to harbor a so-called fugitive or to take pity on a woman running from a fearful past. At first the people shun this mysterious woman but soon find her handy at chores and useful to some extent. As with all human nature Grace is soon exploited because she is weak and at the mercy of the strong, her services used and trodden upon and soon the beginnings of destruction stand firmly in Dogville. The ending is justice and vindication based on the need of all humanity for revenge and a violent end to an unfair situation.This film is intriguing in its message and theory on what exists in the heart of man. Directed brilliantly by Lars von Trier it all seems strange at first until the truth is somehow brought into play. Nicole Kidman is phenomenal as the mysterious woman who becomes the town stepping stone at the sake of her true character. Paul Bettany is perfect as the town philosopher who steers the sleepy inconspicuous town into trouble. The townspeople are played with precision by such great actors as Lauren Bacall and Ben Gazzara along with many other talented individuals. This film is something original and profound with an ability to strike a cord with any society. The story is narrated by John Hurt and the writing is visionary and powerful.If you like films that make you think this one will do it.

Not a perfect movie by any means, but still one that jars you, stuns you, and pokes you uncomfortably enough to either be: 1) turned off totally (as one reviewer was) or 2) inspired to really contemplate the message being portrayed in the movie.  What this movie focuses on ISN'T the warm and fuzzy niceness of being human.Nicole Kidman portrays a woman in some sort of trouble, who turns to the folks in a small Colorado town to help protect and hide her.  They reluctantly do so at first, but then slowly discover their position of power over the woman isn't so uncomfortable after all. And eventually, almost every person in the town begins to exploit the woman's predicament, and their begrudging pseudo-benevolence slowly mutates into horrific abuse.The entire movie is shot on a sound stage resembling a large-scale play set.  Minimal props and effects give the whole story a surrealistic feel.  The characters and their costumes are the only completely made up items in the movie.Not a big Lars Von Trier fan, as he seems quite the pretentious **** at times, and yes, there does seem to be an anti-American slant to his work, but the themes and ideas presented in this movie definitely aren't unique to the U.S.  Several non-American friends of mine didn't see the movie as necessarily an American-bashing flick.  Its message is bit more universal than that.Similar themes have been presented in other stories (""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" came to mind during the film) where we examine a small isolated group of people, trying to define what's moral, what's just (and excessively patting themselves on the back for doing so), but ultimately failing miserably and ending up even further away from the humanity they're proclaiming to represent.Outstanding performances in the film, despite the stage-like setting and minimal props, from Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, et al.  You get the feeling that Von Trier kept things tense on the set, just to add to the overall feeling.If you want to buy/rent a ""feel-good"" flick, then this isn't the one to get.

828859,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B00029QXAK,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[4, 8]","I will open my review of 'Dogville' with a quote from play writer and director Bertolt Brecht:""Estrangement (verfremdung) means to historicize, that is, consider people and incidents as historically conditioned and transitory... The spectator will no longer see the characters on stage as unalterable, uninfluencable, helplessly delivered over to their fate. He will see that his man is such and such, because circumstances are such. And circumstances are such, because man is such. But he in turn is conceivable not only as he is now, but also as he might be-- that is, otherwise-- and the same holds true for circumstances. Hence, the spectator obtains a new attitude in the theatre... He will be received in the theatre as the great 'transformer,' who can intervene in the natural processes and the social processes, and who no longer accepts the world but masters it.""Director Lars von Trier's masterful, however incendiary human drama is reflective of Brecht's theory of verfremdung, or estrangement. Many have complained not only of its striking parallels to the United States of America, but also of its lack of upfront emotion, emphasized by John Hurt's perfect narration. But it is meant to be this way, since von Trier barrows from Brecht's theory, and I think it not only strengthens the film's emotional involvement, but also cancels out any complaints of some sort of lowly attack on Americans, because it becomes far more universal.Even the subtitle is eerily personal: ""In a town not far from here..."" I believe this is meant to establish that the town in the film may be set in Colorado, but is really meant to be psychologically placed by the viewer to wherever he or she feels it is applicable (hence Brecht's theory, once again, since it leaves the connection and action to the viewer who may alter his or her perception of the characters, setting and situation to however he or she wants). The film is also divided up into nine segments beginning with a prologue, each complete in its own right.What is incredible is that this reflection of ""verfremdung"" extends through every aspect the film, from its writing, to its performances, and most importantly to its sets. They are sparse, contrasting with von Trier's earlier films, leaving the walls off of the houses, the dogs off of the streets, and resorting items like these to mere chalk marks so that we may fill in the details as the story unfolds in our minds.Essentially, the story of 'Dogville' concerns a woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who is running from the mob for reasons unknown to the citizens of Dogville, Colorado. They agree to keep her as a result of Tom Edison, Jr.'s (Paul Bettany) persuasion. Progressively, Grace's trust is gained and then lost, despite her efforts, and as the police swing by again and again, they then chain her to a large rusted piece of metal and she is prostituted by the men of the town, all the while working through the day for the villagers, who are frightened, projecting this fear through vilifying Grace's very humanity. This all ends chaotically, and we are meant to decide for ourselves what this film means, how and if it applies to us, what von Trier's objectives were, and finally, how we should react.This explains why there is such a divide among critics and viewers. It is so easily crafted to your own psyche that your view will immediately reflect your opinions of the current state of this world, which the film is so obviously about in addition to human goodness, only further explaining why so many believe it is a direct attack on Americans only, though it is far more than just that (however, I never said that wasn't a part of its message).The performances are virtuoso in that they flawlessly comply with the combination of Brecht's theory and von Trier's emotional rawness. They are at times real and toned down, so that we can also absorb them into our minds and complete them ourselves.The standout is Nicole Kidman, who should receive an Acadamy Award nomination for her work, but probably won't considering how challenging 'Dogville' is as a whole, and the fact that it was released so early in the year. You feel for her interpretation of Grace, even though she is held at such a distance. Her eyes allow us to travel into her mind and assimilate her pains and her desire to somehow requite the misery her company has so willingly inflicted upon her. I began to feel the horror, as well as the towns malignancy within her inner being. It is probably Kidman's best performance to date. She has always been able to bring nuance to a wide variety of vulnerable characters, and this is when I've seen her give the most complete version of that particular persona.Also notable were Paul Bettany and Patricia Clarkson, who both add an astounding array of dimensions to two characters who have more prominence in the film than the rest of the supporting cast. They allow us to understand them, as well, no matter their actions.Ultimately, von Trier has achieved his goal with 'Dogville.' It is his strongest work to date, and has left me contemplating whether or not it is a masterpiece, because it is one of the few films in recent years that attempts to capitalize and reflect the fears, needs and opinions of our time. Further more, it is a most visionary piece, not only visually but emotionally. It allows us to discuss and think about it for weeks, and offers interesting insight into a European view of our world. Though I feel most may immediately reject the film as sick propaganda, take the time to consider the layers von Trier has so masterfully embedded into it. If you do so, I can't guarantee you will still admire the film, but you will have gained much more out of it. In fact, I think it may be impossible to avoid its visceral qualities. In other words, give it a chance. It is all about who you are. Referring back to Brecht's theory, you are allowed to influence and alter, making this film your own.",5,"Applicable in any way, no matter who you are.",1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,5960,"['will',

His two most well-known prior films are prime examples of the genre - ""Dancer in the Dark"" and ""Breaking the Waves.""  What a shock ""Dogville"" is then, in which seemingly every aspect of Dogma 95 is violated!Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a young woman fleeing from gangsters who happens upon a small mountain town in 1930s America.  The town hesitantly agrees to take her in, and they soon use her presence to their advantage.  The conceit is the film's soundstage setting, in the manner of a play.  The feeling it engenders is of ""Our Town,"" only far more twisted.  The obvious question is why von Trier would abandon Dogma 95 and direct one of the stagiest movies possible?  Although an obvious answer is not forthcoming, even in his director's commentary, the format does have a noticeable benefit.  Namely, the film is perhaps as universal in nature as imaginable, which seems to be a goal here.Von Trier's abandonment of Dogma 95 undoubtedly irritated many.  However, ""Dogville"" is likely to alienate people in other ways, specifically by being a 3 hour presentation of a rather simplistic parable.  Is the film worthwhile, and who is likely to enjoy it?  Well, I can think of relatively few audiences who are likely to actually ""enjoy"" the film.  However, I certainly ""appreciated"" it - the film is mesmerizing at times because of its simplicity.Of course, ""Dogville"" has an incredible cast: Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany (looking far less frail than usual), Lauren Bacall, Bergman regular Harriet Andersson, Phillip Baker Hall, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan, Jeremy Davies, Stellan Skarsgard, and Chloe Sevigny.  In addition, the film explores some important basic concepts of human nature, particularly the idea of arrogance, and many scenes are undeniably powerful.  If you enjoy films that examine Big Issues, then ""Dogville"" will likely appeal to you.The film was honored at numerous European film festivals, but largely ignored in the U.S.  I don't think it's as skillfully made a film as ""Dancer in the Dark,"" but ""Dogville"" is not to be missed by adventuresome moviegoers.  Of interest, ""Dogville"" is the first of a pre-planned trilogy - ""USA - Land of Opportunity.""  The second film, ""Manderley"" is in production and carries on the story of Grace, although played by Bryce Dallas Howard this time.  Nicole Kidman was reportedly not able to star in ""Manderley"" because of scheduling conflicts.

The folks in this small isolated town was so nice to her at first, but they eventually turned into nasty people when she became the woman all men wanted to share. How much of nasty treatment can a woman endure before she turns herself into a ""monster""?The cast is absolutely irresistable, and it's rare to see Patricia Clarkson play a mean and nasty woman, considered she was so wonderful in Pieces of April preiously. Bacall and Sevigney are equally good, but their roles are not strong enough. Do prepare to be amazed by the simulated nude sex scene performed by Skarsgard and Kidman, because it seemed very real while the camera actually captured his private part. At the same time, it's interesting that the scene took place in the background while another scene was being played in the foreground. There is no actual sets in this film, so every thing is transparent, and the characters would knock at a door when there was no door. Every house was drawn on the ground, which made the viewiing experience more simplistic than a stage show.James Caan appeared in limited screen time as a mobster. The ending was very shocking and it makes quite a provocative statement. Do give this movie a try if you are curious about the hype on Lars Von Trier, and certainly this is a rare case to see a super low budget film using so many big stars.

That was how I found ""Dogville.""The solid cast hinted at quality: Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, Ben Gazzara, James Caan, and many others. Director Lars Von Trier has put together this innovative and unusual, if challenging, movie about a woman named Grace (Kidman), running from gangsters, who takes refuge in a small town called Dogville sometime during the 1930s.Acting, as it turns out, is what this film relies upon exclusively. The scene unfolds on a basic black stage--black floor with chalk lines designating streets, squares and rectangles that serve as houses and shops and town halls. Nothing, but nothing, detracts from the actors and their exchanges with each other, their movements across this black expanse.Grace slips into town, hiding where she can, as gangsters pursue her for not quite explained reasons. We are not meant to know... yet. She is found by Tom Edison, a young man with a pale, wincing, if philosophical manner. He takes her and her cause to the town hall meeting, where her dilemma is discussed. She needs a place to hide from her pursuers, and the town inhabitants decide, with some misgivings, to offer it to her.What unfolds next is our increasingly uncomfortable watch over the gradual ethical and moral decay of this (any?) town. Grace seeks work to earn her keep. Initially, no one seems to have any for her. There is an unspoken, but polite resistance to her presence. Little by little, however, people open their homes and businesses to her, and as they learn how well she works, they give her ever more to do. Since she does not resist increased labor, she is given more. And more. And more to do. A sped up sequence in the film has us watching from above, rather God-like, as Grace zips through town, from one house to the next, from one store to the next, doing her duties and accepting more duties, and this at decreasing pay.It appears the lesson here is that excellence never goes unpunished, and when we do nothing to express our personal boundaries of what kind of treatment we will accept, we are inevitably, eventually, taken for granted, inviting our own abuse.But the lesson grows far more harsh. Grace is an attractive woman. She is sweet. She is pleasant and eager to please. She is helpful, kind, forgiving, accepting, nice nice nice. Men in Dogville take notice. Their hunger begins to show. Their hunger turns into the ugliest forms of lust, and Grace is raped by the keeper of the town apple orchard. We feel a mix of horror and sympathy for the ever suffering Grace at this scene of violence.And still, this woman has no boundaries. Still, she does nothing to stop the downslide of the town's morals, allowing herself to become also the town prostitute, the town slave, the town joke. Even the children turn against her. Only Tom Edison declares in a simpering voice that, oh, he loves her. Yet he quietly stands by as she is debased to the point of having an iron collar bolted around her neck and then to an iron chain, fastened to a heavy wheel that she must then drag behind her. Indeed, he expects gratitude from her. Even... reciprocated love.The movie ends with a fascinating twist that asks a question each viewer must then answer for him or herself: is it saintliness or is it arrogance to accept and forgive the transgressions of others endlessly, without limit? Is it a kindness to play the victim and the martyr? Or is it nothing other than giving permission, even invitation, for those around us to debase us as far as we allow it? In short, did God really mean for us to be doormats?Suffice it to say, I was completely nailed by this movie. To the spot. It has me feeling, thinking, wondering, questioning and understanding. What more can a good movie do?",5,Dogged by Shadows in Human Nature,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,4025,"['tend', 'pick', 'new', 'releases', 'movies', 'much', 'do', 'books', 'bookstores', 'avoid', 'ones', 'great', 'showy', 'piles', 'titles', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'take', 'more', 'careful', 'look', 'single', 'copies', 'perhaps', 'back', 'shelf', 'perhaps', 'find', 'buried', 'treasure', 'was', 'how', 'found', 'Dogville', 'solid', 'cast', 'hinted', 'quality', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'James', 'Caan', 'many', 'others', 'Director', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'put', 'together', 'innovative', 'unusual', 'challenging', 'movie', 'woman', 'named', 'Grace', 'Kidman', 'running', 'gangsters', 'who', 'refuge', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Dogville', 'sometime', '1930s.Acting', 'out', 'what', 'film', 'exclusively', 'scene', 'basic', 'black', 'stage', 'black', 'floor', 'chalk', 'lines', 'designating', 'streets', 'squares', 'rectangles', 'serve', 'houses', 'shops', 'town', 'halls', 'Nothing', 'nothing', 'actors', 'exchanges', 'other', 'movements', 'black', 'expanse.Grace', 'town', 'hiding', 'where', 'can', 'gangsters', 'pursue', 'not', 'quite', 'explained', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'know', 'yet', 'found', 'Tom', 'Edison', 'young', 'man', 'pale', 'wincing', 'philosophical', 'manner', 'cause', 'town', 'hall', 'meeting', 'where', 'dilemma', 'discussed', 'place', 'hide', 'pursuers', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'decide', 'misgivings', 'offer', 'her.What', 'unfolds', 'next', 'increasingly', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'gradual', 'ethical', 'moral', 'decay', 'town', 'Grace', 'work', 'earn', 'keep', 'Initially', 'one', 'have', 'unspoken', 'polite', 'resistance', 'presence', 'Little', 'little', 'however', 'people', 'open', 'homes', 'businesses', 'learn', 'how', 'well', 'give', 'ever', 'more', 'do', 'not', 'resist', 'increased', 'labor', 'given', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'do', 'A', 'sped', 'up', 'sequence', 'film', 'watching', 'rather', 'God-like', 'Grace', 'zips', 'town', 'one', 'house', 'next', 'one', 'store', 'next', 'doing', 'duties', 'accepting', 'more', 'duties', 'decreasing', 'pay.It', 'lesson', 'here', 'excellence', 'never', 'unpunished', 'when', 'do', 'nothing', 'express', 'personal', 'boundaries', 'what', 'kind', 'treatment', 'will', 'accept', 'are', 'inevitably', 'eventually', 'taken', 'granted', 'inviting', 'own', 'abuse.But', 'lesson', 'far', 'more', 'harsh', 'Grace', 'attractive', 'woman', 'sweet', 'pleasant', 'eager', 'please', 'helpful', 'kind', 'forgiving', 'accepting', 'nice', 'nice', 'nice', 'Men', 'Dogville', 'take', 'notice', 'hunger', 'show', 'hunger', 'ugliest', 'forms', 'lust', 'Grace', 'raped', 'keeper', 'town', 'apple', 'orchard', 'feel', 'mix', 'horror', 'sympathy', 'ever', 'suffering', 'Grace', 'scene', 'violence.And', 'still', 'woman', 'boundaries', 'Still', 'nothing', 'stop', 'downslide', 'town', 'morals', 'allowing', 'become', 'also', 'town', 'prostitute', 'town', 'slave', 'town', 'joke', 'Even', 'children', 'turn', 'Only', 'Tom', 'Edison', 'simpering', 'voice', 'oh', 'quietly', 'debased', 'point', 'having', 'iron', 'collar', 'bolted', 'neck', 'then', 'iron', 'chain', 'fastened', 'heavy', 'wheel', 'must', 'then', 'drag', 'Indeed', 'gratitude', 'Even', 'reciprocated', 'love.The', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'twist', 'question', 'viewer', 'must', 'then', 'answer', 'saintliness', 'arrogance', 'accept', 'forgive', 'transgressions', 'others', 'endlessly', 'limit', 'kindness', 'play', 'victim', 'martyr', 'nothing', 'other', 'giving', 'permission', 'even', 'invitation', 'debase', 'as', 'far', 'allow', 'short', 'did', 'God', 'really', 'mean', 'be', 'doormats', 'Suffice', 'say', 'was', 'completely', 'nailed', 'movie', 'spot', 'feeling', 'thinking', 'wondering', 'questioning', 'understanding', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'good', 'movie', 'do']",N/A
