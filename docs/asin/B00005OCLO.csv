Drugs, sex and death. I watched this alone, please don't watch this film alone.Paul Bettany and cast of this film get into a lot of drugs for fun. Yes, they do! Why ?? To make the story more sick and as it goes on it gets sicker.This film is not for children or someone with a weak heart. This film isn't easy to watch at all.The end of the film was great ,because it was over.Paul Bettany, will wake you right up around the end of this film. I have to say that, Paul Bettany will do any role that dark and filled with anger. I feel Paul Bettany pushes himself again and again so he not put in one kind of role. He doesn't want to do the same role again and again. I love that about Paul Bettany.",5,'Mood Swingers' Don't watch alone.,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,809,"[""'Mood"", 'Swingers', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Well', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'someone', 'film', 'sick', 'Drugs', 'sex', 'death', 'watched', 'alone', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'Bettany', 'cast', 'film', 'get', 'lot', 'drugs', 'fun', 'Yes', 'do', 'Why', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'sick', 'sicker.This', 'film', 'not', 'children', 'someone', 'weak', 'heart', 'film', ""n't"", 'easy', 'watch', 'all.The', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'over.Paul', 'Bettany', 'will', 'wake', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'will', 'do', 'role', 'dark', 'filled', 'anger', 'feel', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'again', 'again', 'so', 'not', 'put', 'one', 'kind', 'role', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'same', 'role', 'again', 'again', 'love', 'Paul', 'Bettany']",Mood Swingers

672554,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005OCLO,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 3]","This picture is a quintessential nihilist picture.  If you share the value system that life has no meaning or value, you may find some comfort in the Conceptualists from this film.  William Marsh who plays the drug-dealing Marvel in the film also directed and wrote the screenplay.  I have no idea what the feud entailed between Marsh and producer Holmes' final cut of the film, but I doubt it could essentially be less dreadful.  Paul Bettany has shown himself to have a great range from ""Wimbledon"" to ""Gangster No. 1,"" so I wanted to see this film.  As the self-absorbed Quentin, he turns in another performance that surpasses the material.  Titled ""Dead Babies"" in England, ""Mood Swingers"" shows a group of bored and insecure people getting together for the weekend for drugs and free sex.  Olivia Williams who starred as the mother in ""Peter Pan"" and the wife in ""The 6th Sense"" is a bored and restless woman looking for kicks.  Alexandra Gilbreath plays Bettany's wife and is equally restless for some unnamed satisfaction.  She looks nice dancing in her sheer floral print blouse, but one hardly understands what draws the character to this loose company.  Andy Nyman as the pimple-faced heavy-set loser who prances around in his bathrobe wondering why he can't find a lover turns in one of the best performances.  Charlie Condon as Giles also does a nice job as the insecure weakling who worries about his teeth.  Kris Marshall does a great job as the part psycho/part victim/part gay crazy Skip.  Added to this is the nymphomaniac Roxanne played by Hayley Carr and Lucy who has the rep as a loose woman.  All in all, the plot twists through the Conceptualists invading the weekend party and unexpectedly turns to a pile of corpses.  While certainly foreshadowed, the ending still seems to come out of left field.  In the end, watching this film is mostly a waste of time and money.

672555,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00005OCLO,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[11, 14]","In spite of a somewhat ham-fisted ending, Mood Swingers delivers the goods.  It's a relatively plotless tale of a bunch of young blokes and babes who converge in London--three of them are American--for a weekend of drug-induced chaos.  The drug supplier is played by the same chap who wrote and directed the film, which is based on a novel by British bad boy author Martin Amis--who even blurbs the film on the DVD front cover!More an ensemble piece than anything else, the film veers wildly from relatively straightforward narrative to occasionally very imaginative jump cutting.  The thrust here doesn't seem to be storytelling as much as it is a &quot;let's cram as much sharp dialogue, striking images, and violent segues into this 100 minutes as possible&quot;.  The emphasis is on violence--meaning, not graphic violence (although yes, there is some of that)--but more to the point, a violent, hyperbolic style.This is in keeping with the source material from Martin Amis.  The youthfulness of the group aligns with their powerful urges for sex and drugs and also with the violent style of the film.  This three-way convergence actually works well and it would have been perfect if the same approach had been used for the ending, which unfortunately descends into a thicker, more predictable mode when the real perpretrator of the graphic violence is revealed.Nevertheless, this is an interesting film because of the chances it takes stylistically and the often sharp--and funny--dialogue.  The mixture of biting comedy, intense emotionality, and sudden outbursts of manic energy is more than enough to hold your interest throughout.Different and worthwhile.",4,"Quirky, flashy, erratic, intriguing",1008460800,"12 16, 2001",2001,1664,"['spite', 'somewhat', 'ham-fisted', 'ending', 'Mood', 'Swingers', 'goods', 'relatively', 'plotless', 'tale', 'bunch', 'young', 'blokes', 'babes', 'who', 'converge', 'London', 'three', 'are', 'American', 'weekend', 'drug-induced', 'chaos', 'drug', 'supplier', 'played', 'same', 'chap', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'British', 'bad', 'boy', 'author', 'Martin', 'Amis', 'who', 'even', 'blurbs', 'film', 'DVD', 'front', 'cover', 'More', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'veers', 'wildly', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'narrative', 'occasionally', 'very', 'imaginative', 'jump', 'cutting', 'thrust', 'here', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'storytelling', 'as', 'much', 'quot', 'cram', 'much', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'striking', 'images', 'violent', 'segues', '100', 'minutes', 'possible', 'quot', 'emphasis', 'violence', 'meaning', 'not', 'graphic', 'violence', 'yes', 'more', 'point', 'violent', 'hyperbolic', 'style.This', 'keeping', 'source', 'material', 'Martin', 'Amis', 'youthfulness', 'group', 'powerful', 'urges', 'sex', 'drugs', 'also', 'violent', 'style', 'film', 'three-way', 'convergence', 'actually', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'same', 'approach', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'ending', 'unfortunately', 'thicker', 'more', 'predictable', 'mode', 'when', 'real', 'perpretrator', 'graphic', 'violence', 'revealed.Nevertheless', 'interesting', 'film', 'chances', 'stylistically', 'often', 'sharp', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'mixture', 'biting', 'comedy', 'intense', 'emotionality', 'sudden', 'outbursts', 'manic', 'energy', 'more', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'throughout.Different', 'worthwhile']",Mood Swingers
