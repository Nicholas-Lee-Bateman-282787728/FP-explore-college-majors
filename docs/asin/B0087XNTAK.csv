1548221,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0087XNTAK,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[9, 10]","Yoga Foundations is a Level 1 or beginner yoga DVD featuring self-dubbed ""Ultimate Yogi"" Travis Eliot.  On this DVD, Eliot offers three live yoga classes designed to provide a foundation yoga practice for beginners.  To further assist those new to yoga, he has included a video tutorial breaking down many of the postures.  In addition, the DVD case includes a 36-page ""Training Guide.""  This insert provides the sequencing of poses for each of the three routines as well as offers additional form and alignment guidelines for some of the postures.  Finally, there is a brief bio on Eliot--describing him as a ""rising star"" in today's yoga community and noting that he is on the faculty at Kripalu yoga center--as well as a review of Eliot's 108 dayThe Ultimate Yogiprogram.The breakdowns I have give below are taken directly from the DVD insert (times added by me).  However, I should note that many poses from each class are actually NOT included on the insert breakdown--for examples, Class 2 has several more floor poses, including bridge, reclining pigeon, and shoulderstand.CLASS 1 SEQUENCING (46 minutes)Cross Legged SeatedSide Stretch (L/R)Seated Twist (L/R)Table Top PoseCat Cow TiltChild's PoseDownward Facing DogMountain PoseTriangle (L/R)PlankSphinxCobraButterflyBridgeReclining PigeonReclining Twist (L/R)Corpse PoseCLASS 2 SEQUENCING (54 minutes)Child's PoseTable TopCat CowSunbirdDownward Facing DogForward FoldFlat Back1 Arm Standing Twist (L/R)Standing Shoulder Roll1/2 SquatWarrior 1Warrior 2Reverse WarriorSide AngleTriangleExtended TriangleYoga SquatPlankCobraCorpse PoseCLASS 3 SEQUENCING (53 minutes)Child's PoseTable TopSun Bird PoseDownward Facing DogForward FoldMountain PoseHalf Sun SalutationsPlank PoseCrocodile PoseSphinx PoseFloating Cobra FlowDownward Facing DogForward FoldCobraDownward Facing DogSun Salutation ASun Salutation BSpread Legs Forward Fold Shoulder StretchTree PoseChair TwistCamel PoseCobblerReclining PigeonReverse CobraShoulder StandReclining TwistCorpse PoseEliot teaches live to a small class of background exercisers.  Sometimes he briefly moves through a few postures, but in general, he is walking amongst the group.  One thing I found confusing was that he seemed to alternate between sometimes mirror cuing to the viewer and sometimes NOT doing so; even the class members appeared uncertain at times as to which side they were supposed to be on.  Similarly, I thought Eliot came off as somewhat inexperienced, both as a video instructor (in addition to the cuing issue, he would also sometimes have you faced AWAY from the TV, which was awkward) and also in his general yoga instruction.  Regarding the latter, I just noticed that he didn't provide much detail on alignment, nor did he give cues such as to change the crossing of your hands in postures.Eliot did have a nice, easy-going manner, and I am sure many people would find him soothing as well as enjoy the relaxed vibe of these practices.  I don't believe that Eliot provides quite enough instruction for those brand-new to yoga, so I would suggest that this DVD would be best suited to those at an experienced beginner level.",4,Nice selection of three yoga practices geared toward beginners,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,3142,"['Yoga', 'Foundations', 'Level', '1', 'beginner', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'self-dubbed', 'Ultimate', 'Yogi', 'Travis', 'Eliot', 'DVD', 'Eliot', 'three', 'live', 'yoga', 'classes', 'designed', 'provide', 'foundation', 'yoga', 'practice', 'beginners', 'further', 'assist', 'new', 'yoga', 'included', 'video', 'tutorial', 'breaking', 'down', 'many', 'postures', 'addition', 'DVD', 'case', '36-page', 'Training', 'Guide', 'insert', 'sequencing', 'poses', 'three', 'routines', 'as', 'well', 'offers', 'additional', 'form', 'alignment', 'guidelines', 'postures', 'Finally', 'brief', 'bio', 'Eliot', 'describing', 'rising', 'star', 'today', 'yoga', 'community', 'noting', 'faculty', 'Kripalu', 'yoga', 'center', 'as', 'well', 'review', 'Eliot', '108', 'dayThe', 'Ultimate', 'Yogiprogram.The', 'breakdowns', 'have', 'give', 'below', 'are', 'taken', 'directly', 'DVD', 'insert', 'times', 'added', 'However', 'should', 'note', 'many', 'poses', 'class', 'are', 'actually', 'NOT', 'included', 'insert', 'breakdown', 'examples', 'Class', '2', 'several', 'more', 'floor', 'poses', 'including', 'bridge', 'reclining', 'pigeon', 'shoulderstand.CLASS', '1', 'SEQUENCING', '46', 'minutes', 'Cross', 'Legged', 'SeatedSide', 'Stretch', 'L/R', 'Seated', 'Twist', 'L/R', 'Table', 'Top', 'PoseCat', 'Cow', 'TiltChild', 'PoseDownward', 'Facing', 'DogMountain', 'PoseTriangle', 'L/R', 'PlankSphinxCobraButterflyBridgeReclining', 'PigeonReclining', 'Twist', 'L/R', 'Corpse', 'PoseCLASS', '2', 'SEQUENCING', '54', 'minutes', 'Child', 'PoseTable', 'TopCat', 'CowSunbirdDownward', 'Facing', 'DogForward', 'FoldFlat', 'Back1', 'Arm', 'Standing', 'Twist', 'L/R', 'Standing', 'Shoulder', 'Roll1/2', 'SquatWarrior', '1Warrior', '2Reverse', 'WarriorSide', 'AngleTriangleExtended', 'TriangleYoga', 'SquatPlankCobraCorpse', 'PoseCLASS', '3', 'SEQUENCING', '53', 'minutes', 'Child', 'PoseTable', 'TopSun', 'Bird', 'PoseDownward', 'Facing', 'DogForward', 'FoldMountain', 'PoseHalf', 'Sun', 'SalutationsPlank', 'PoseCrocodile', 'PoseSphinx', 'PoseFloating', 'Cobra', 'FlowDownward', 'Facing', 'DogForward', 'FoldCobraDownward', 'Facing', 'DogSun', 'Salutation', 'ASun', 'Salutation', 'BSpread', 'Legs', 'Forward', 'Fold', 'Shoulder', 'StretchTree', 'PoseChair', 'TwistCamel', 'PoseCobblerReclining', 'PigeonReverse', 'CobraShoulder', 'StandReclining', 'TwistCorpse', 'PoseEliot', 'live', 'small', 'class', 'background', 'exercisers', 'Sometimes', 'moves', 'few', 'postures', 'general', 'walking', 'group', 'One', 'thing', 'found', 'confusing', 'was', 'seemed', 'alternate', 'sometimes', 'mirror', 'cuing', 'viewer', 'sometimes', 'NOT', 'doing', 'so', 'even', 'class', 'members', 'appeared', 'uncertain', 'times', 'side', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'Similarly', 'thought', 'Eliot', 'came', 'off', 'somewhat', 'inexperienced', 'video', 'instructor', 'addition', 'cuing', 'issue', 'would', 'also', 'sometimes', 'have', 'faced', 'AWAY', 'TV', 'was', 'awkward', 'also', 'general', 'yoga', 'instruction', 'Regarding', 'latter', 'just', 'noticed', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'detail', 'alignment', 'did', 'give', 'cues', 'such', 'change', 'crossing', 'hands', 'postures.Eliot', 'did', 'have', 'nice', 'easy-going', 'manner', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'soothing', 'as', 'well', 'enjoy', 'relaxed', 'vibe', 'practices', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Eliot', 'quite', 'enough', 'instruction', 'brand-new', 'yoga', 'would', 'suggest', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'suited', 'experienced', 'beginner', 'level']",N/A

I think this DVD has great progression, although I think if you are TRULY a beginner to yoga it'd be best to start with a few classes with an in-person instructor for safety purposes, otherwise this is one of the best foundation DVDs I have tried.  I have been doing yoga off and on for about 12 years, but because I am never consistent I always have a period where I want to go back to basics.  This is a great DVD for that, and also great if you are just looking for something to add to your workout routine a couple of times a week.

1548226,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B0087XNTAK,Leanne,"[16, 17]","I bought this DVD in order to work up to doing the entireThe Ultimate Yogiprogram.  It contains three practices, and each is just over 50 minutes long.  Each one builds on the previous one in terms of difficulty (or so it has seemed to me), which makes them nice to use to build up your strength.  I love all three of these so far, and highly recommend this disk!As a bit of background, I used to take bi-weekly yoga classes about fifteen years ago, but no longer have the time to attend live classes.  I own about ten yoga DVDs (my current favorites are the Raviana Kundalini ones), but, as mentioned above, I've been looking for something that was more of a system, instead of stand-alone DVDs, and thought that this particular Yoga Foundations disk would be a good way to work into the Ultimate Yoga program.Since I have a bit of background in yoga, I've found that the poses are very easy to follow along with.  If you're new to yoga, this DVD also comes with a very nice booklet that details all of the poses, so you can read more about them before or after doing the three practices.  If you're brand new, I would also say to repeat practice 1 a few times before moving on the second and third practices.Travis' voice is also very soothing, and I love how he explains everything so that you can listen and follow along, instead of having to peek up at the screen.  With some yoga and workout DVDs I own, the cueing is such that you constantly have to look at the TV to see what is going on.All in all, this is a great DVD that should be useful for beginning and intermediate yoga students.Namaste!",5,Great set of three different yoga practices,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,1603,"['bought', 'DVD', 'order', 'work', 'up', 'doing', 'entireThe', 'Ultimate', 'Yogiprogram', 'three', 'practices', 'just', '50', 'minutes', 'long', 'one', 'builds', 'previous', 'one', 'terms', 'difficulty', 'so', 'seemed', 'nice', 'use', 'build', 'up', 'strength', 'love', 'three', 'so', 'far', 'highly', 'recommend', 'disk', 'bit', 'background', 'used', 'take', 'bi-weekly', 'yoga', 'classes', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'time', 'attend', 'live', 'classes', 'own', 'about', 'ten', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'current', 'favorites', 'are', 'Raviana', 'Kundalini', 'ones', 'mentioned', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'something', 'was', 'more', 'system', 'instead', 'stand-alone', 'DVDs', 'thought', 'particular', 'Yoga', 'Foundations', 'disk', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'work', 'Ultimate', 'Yoga', 'program.Since', 'have', 'bit', 'background', 'yoga', ""'ve"", 'found', 'poses', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'along', ""'re"", 'new', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'booklet', 'details', 'poses', 'can', 'read', 'more', 'doing', 'three', 'practices', ""'re"", 'brand', 'new', 'would', 'also', 'say', 'repeat', 'practice', '1', 'few', 'times', 'moving', 'second', 'third', 'practices.Travis', 'voice', 'also', 'very', 'soothing', 'love', 'how', 'everything', 'so', 'can', 'listen', 'follow', 'along', 'instead', 'having', 'peek', 'up', 'screen', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'own', 'cueing', 'such', 'constantly', 'have', 'look', 'TV', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'on.All', 'great', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'useful', 'beginning', 'intermediate', 'yoga', 'students.Namaste']",N/A

I always felt like I had to be able to move into the positions immediately, and that if I wasn't flexible or able to hold myself up only with my pinky (I exaggerate), I was a failure.  After reading the reviews and watching a clip of the DVD, I decided to try this video.  OMG, changed my perspective and started to impact my life in so many positive ways.  One of my goals this year was not to attract or cause negativity, and this DVD has definitely helped in my success (yes, we're not even done with January, but considering the type of job I have and my family, that's saying A LOT).  Since trying it on day one, I have felt healthier, both mentally and physically.  Travis' instruction is PERFECTION.  I could close my eyes through this ENTIRE workout and not have to look up to see how to get into the moves.  The DVD has three workouts, the first focuses more on strength and foundational poses.  The second still has a lot of stretch moves, but starts to bring in strength, and I just did the third workout yesterday (going on my third week) and it is more cardio and strength.  I have NEVER been able to go from plank pose, into a pushup pose to the floor...EVER...the third workout has a few moves where you go from plank, to pushup, to cobra, to downward dog, and I was able to do the pushup component EVERY time.  Even though the third routine WORKS you out, I did not get tired or exhausted during the workout, and felt great after.  I also am amazed at how the time flies...most of the workouts are close to an hour long, if not longer, and I can't even tell.  Other workouts I'm counting down the minutes and can't wait until it's over, with this, I just shut down my brain, do the moves to the best of MY ability, and come out totally relaxed and ready for the world.  I find myself looking forward to the next workout, and have done at least 6 days a week.  I find myself making time.  Travis is PHENOMENAL...LOVE him.  Soothing, awesome instructor, keeps it to the routine, and guides you through the moves so you tailor it to the best of YOUR ability.  Highly recommend.  For the price, you're getting an AMAZING deal.  I bought the Ultimate Yogi 108 day program, and look forward to starting that once I've mastered this foundational DVD.  I am calmer, can control my stress and just take everything with a grain of salt.
