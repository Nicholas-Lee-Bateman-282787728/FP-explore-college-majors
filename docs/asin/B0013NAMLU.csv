1143951,A32O98PFC3OP7K,B0013NAMLU,A Gamer at Heart,"[2, 2]","I absolutely loved this series.  I started watching over the summer when there was not a lot of television.  I did not know much about it other than the fact that it was highly rated by viewers on Netflix, and decided to give it a try.  GLAD I DID!  The series began regular broadcasting on October 10, 2006 in Canada on CBC starring Ian Tracey and Klea Scott.  The show follows Jimmy Reardon (Tracey), one of Vancouver's top organized crime bosses, head of a third generation west coast crime syndicate (think Tony Soprano but Canadian), and Mary Spalding (Scott), the director of the Vancouver Organized Crime Unit (OCU) (or our US feds).  Mary Spalding (a complex character who may be good and may not be, highly ambitious and willing to step on anyone who gets in her way) offers Reardon immunity from prosecution in exchange for his role as a police informant. Crime boss Reardon is working to avoid issues with his rival, the Disciples Motorcycle club, who is trying to control Vancouver's marijuana trade and money laundering industry.

1143952,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B0013NAMLU,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[3, 16]","This TV series was billed as Canada's answer to the great U.S. series ""The Wire."" However it falls far short of that show in almost every respect.The basic premise is that everyone in this show is spying on everyone else. The police chief spies on her superiors while her subordinate plots to replace her. The drug dealer at the heart of the show gives to and receives information from the police. The U.S. drug enforcement agency is also involved in the plot. The twists and turns become bewildering -- and then tedious.In ""the Wire"", the city of Baltimore becomes a crucial and vibrant character in its own right. ""Intelligence"" is set in Vancouver, which ought to be an attractive and interesting venue -- but is a non-factor. There is no strong sense of place.I was also intrigued by the lack of basic civil liberty protections in Canada as depicted by this show. In the United States, as seen in ""The Wire"" it is incredibly difficult for the police to set up surveillance -- and the criminals take elaborate precautions to avoid being surveilled. The technological challenges are immense, especially with the advent of throw-away cellphones.In this show, the police set up wires and keep them running at the drop of a hat. If there is a technical problem or legal issues setting them up, we don't see them.The biggest problem is that the characters here are not compelling. The gangsters are too gentle -- they don't kill or torture. They have no muscle. Their sex club is not sexy -- in fact nobody seems to have sex. The ""villains"" are too nice, the police are too sneaky, the political intrigue is not intriguing, there's no intensity and the script lacks wit.This series has no real depth and most of all lacks humanity. Its complexities are not sufficiently complex to be compelling.

If it were, it would quickly eclipse the usually predictable and increasingly gory American crime series that Amazon's reviewer seems to prefer.Unlike many of its American competitors, ""Intelligence"" is not a show that aims at the lowest common denominator.  Instead, it requires a bit of intelligence on the part of the viewer to sort through the convoluted plots and the complex characters, but the effort is worth it. The second season, which just started playing overseas when I returned to the States, is even better, which makes it all the more shameful that the Canadian Broadcasting Company is apparently not going to pick it up for a third season.I have heard that there is some talk of reviving the series on cable and changing its locale to an American city.  Continuing ""Intelligence"" is a great idea, but changing locales is not.

I also could not disagree more with the Amazon review.  Point in fact that if I could give 4 1/2-stars I would, as the series is just a notch under perfect.  First and foremost, for a crime drama there is a surprising lack of gratuitous violence.  Could this be a result of the copious amounts of alcohol consumed?  The aforementioned may put many people off that are accustomed to American TV a la ""24"" and the ""CSI Trilogy.""  Violence does lurk beneath the surface, though even when deemed necessary we rarely get to see it on screen.Perhaps my reason for not giving the series 5-stars is that a good portion of the show is filmed in a strip club with nary a bare breast seen (not sure if this is  a result of CBC sensors or simply a decision made by the producers).  Seriously, it may actually be the lack of gratuitous sex & violence that make this series work, as the focus is more on interior & exterior power struggles and the resulting sub plots, yea? (Apparently, in Vancouver it is common to finish a sentence with ""yea"").  The other interesting aspect to show, which was frequently a topic of discussions among my friends and I, was how such relatively ""soft"" organization could manage a criminal enterprise that generated 9-figures annually?  Again, perhaps this goes to how criminal enterprises are managed in Canada?I would recommend this series to anyone that is a fan of well written crime dramas sans the sex & violence.  If you pinned me down I would have to say the real reason why this would not rate 5-stars is that the characters are not multi layered, which while may be enough to not generate a fifth star, still place this series in the top tier of anything that is currently in the USA/UK.*Does anyone recognize Jimmy's Brother Mike as the Rick Diesel from ""Eddie & the Cruisers 2?""",4,"Intelligence is for the ""Intelligent!""

Matt Brewer is the ultimate creep as an ambitious, double-crossing and back-stabbing intelligence officer.

1143967,A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5,B0013NAMLU,Olaf Johnson,"[2, 8]","I'm surprised by all the positive feedback here. I gave 3.5 stars. The plot is very much convoluted to the point where there is no real plot and it seems the direction of the show is to get everyone in Vancouver wired and on the inside of something. I've never worked for Law Enforcement in Vancouver but I am somewhat familiar with the drug (marijuana) trade around the Alberta/BC region so I found it very hard to swallow that the marijuana market was pulling in millions per week for Jim and that the law would need to wire and bug everything in the city to catch marijuana dealers. I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s New York City scene and I am familiar with all sorts of ""real world"" drug issues so it may be my regional bias that prohibits me from thinking that Vancouver is a crime syndicate capitol of the galaxy. I also didn't quite understand the USA's involvement in any of that nor what it has to do with Chinese triads and Mid-East terrorism or diamonds/guns in the Congo.Also incredible to swallow was understanding why getting promoted in the ranks is so important to characters (Ted and Deacons) when they clearly showed a contempt for working there and would not gain much more power or salary in promotion. Only once in the first 8 episodes someone mentions salary as a reason for promotion or working elsehwere outside the agency. That said there is some confusion in what the motivation is for the characters. The criminals naturally want to make more money and gain territory for selling pot or ATM machines. Jim to be seen as a villian by the time we meet him is odd because he already seems to already be rich enough to exit this world scotch free with this daughter. He even claims he wants out several times but we know why he stays - the same reason DeNiro went back at the end of Heat. Also as a character I just didn't get that he was ambitious at any point in his past to be at the top of the pot trade. As for the agency, these good guys seem to only be out to impress themselves by acruing informants and wiring everything and not really wanting to catch anyone. After 8 shows you are left thinking they don't even want to catch bad guys anymore just spend government money setting up taps, paying off informants, putting guys on the inside. It is really pointless from a viewer's perspective because we are told that the main criminal carrot is somewhere overseas in Hong Kong or the Mid East so spending billions on informants and taps in the small drug and arms trade in Vancouver seems laughable. This is even expressed between Mary and her lover in one of the early episodes where he says his department spend billions to tap out a criminal that was worth way less.If anything the main conflict lies more so between law enforcement employees themselves and between the criminals themselves but there is no tension at all between law and crime.That said, what drives excitement is the communication or lack thereof between the characters that should be talking. Much like the LOST TV show, Intellegence relies of key players not communicating at key times to ramp up the drama. This drags the story out and after LOST I will never dedicate another 6 years to a singular TV show waiting for something spectacular to happen.

It certainly meets their standards and often surpasses them in plot and character development.  The series (so far -- through the first season and into the first couple of weeks of the second) doesn't throw the kinds of plot surprises at the viewer which indicate that the writers were having a hard time figuring out what to do next. Instead, you become a believer and a fully-engaged partner in the action. Character drives action.  As other reviewers have suggested, it really gets under your skin.Here's the thing:  The writers of this and other notable Canadian TV series show respect for the viewer.  They don't belabor each point; they don't hammer home each plot twist.  They don't nudge-nudge and they don't overdo.  Of course, the pleasure of watching this series demands a little more imagination and focus than many American series (frequent exception:  The Wire) which seem to play to an attention span of about three minutes.  Result:  the viewer feels respected and drawn in, rather than patronized.Klea Scott is endlessly compelling; Matt Frewer becomes a wonderfully detestable and (we hope) doomed sleazeball; Bernie Coulson's Mike has you on tenterhooks, waiting for his next screw-up.  Ian Tracey, as the complicated and attractive drug lord, is competent and deft. Throughout each 45 minute episode, a crew of directors has you hooked on the interplay between Vancouver's drug underground and ambitious (not to mention vicious and corrupt) American and Canadian officials.I envy you if you haven't yet seen this series -- you have a treat in store!",5,Hooked!,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1635,"['Intelligence', 'been', 'compared', 'Wire', 'other', 'HBO', 'series', 'certainly', 'standards', 'often', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'couple', 'weeks', 'second', ""n't"", 'throw', 'kinds', 'plot', 'surprises', 'viewer', 'indicate', 'writers', 'were', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'Instead', 'become', 'believer', 'fully-engaged', 'partner', 'action', 'Character', 'action', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'suggested', 'really', 'thing', 'writers', 'other', 'notable', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'series', 'show', 'respect', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'belabor', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'hammer', 'home', 'plot', 'twist', 'do', ""n't"", 'nudge-nudge', 'do', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'course', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'series', 'little', 'more', 'imagination', 'focus', 'many', 'American', 'series', 'frequent', 'exception', 'Wire', 'seem', 'play', 'attention', 'span', 'three', 'minutes', 'Result', 'viewer', 'feels', 'respected', 'drawn', 'rather', 'patronized.Klea', 'Scott', 'endlessly', 'compelling', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'wonderfully', 'detestable', 'hope', 'doomed', 'sleazeball', 'Bernie', 'Coulson', 'Mike', 'tenterhooks', 'waiting', 'next', 'screw-up', 'Ian', 'Tracey', 'complicated', 'attractive', 'drug', 'lord', 'competent', 'deft', '45', 'minute', 'episode', 'crew', 'directors', 'hooked', 'interplay', 'Vancouver', 'drug', 'underground', 'ambitious', 'not', 'mention', 'vicious', 'corrupt', 'American', 'Canadian', 'officials.I', 'envy', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'series', 'have', 'treat', 'store']",Intelligence: Season 1
