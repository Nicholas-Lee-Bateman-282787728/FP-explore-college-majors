1353831,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B003LXM1QE,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[0, 1]","Before I start savagely ripping apart this dvd, let me just say that it's a testament to Will Ferrell's talent and his impact on &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34; that he actually has a third volume of his supposed best work, and that he's the only former cast member thus far to have multiple volumes.With that out of the way, this dvd is an utter turd in execution. The majority of these sketches come from his post-show cameos and his 2005 hosting gig, neither of which had Ferrell bring his A game. The &#34;Celebrity Jeopardy sketch and the Robert Goulet bit are shadows of his past appearances. The Bush / Palin sketch is a waste of one of &#34;SNL&#34;'s best presidential impersonations. The Spartans sketch and &#34;Get Off the Shed&#34; are repeats! This is by far the laziest &#34;SNL&#34; best-of all time.The saddest thing is that after three volumes, some of Ferrell's best stuff still hasn't been represented yet (we've had three dvd now without Neil Diamond's &#34;Storytellers&#34;). If a fourth volume is inevitable, then &#34;SNL&#34; had better do their hoemwork.",1,"The Worst Best-Of ""SNL"" Has Ever Put Out.",1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,1079,"['start', 'savagely', 'ripping', 'apart', 'dvd', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'testament', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'talent', 'impact', '34', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', '34', 'actually', 'third', 'volume', 'supposed', 'best', 'work', 'only', 'former', 'cast', 'member', 'thus', 'far', 'have', 'multiple', 'volumes.With', 'way', 'dvd', 'utter', 'turd', 'execution', 'majority', 'sketches', 'come', 'post-show', 'cameos', '2005', 'hosting', 'gig', 'had', 'Ferrell', 'bring', 'game', '34', 'Celebrity', 'Jeopardy', 'sketch', 'Robert', 'Goulet', 'bit', 'are', 'shadows', 'past', 'appearances', 'Bush', '/', 'Palin', 'sketch', 'waste', 'one', '34', 'SNL', '34', 'best', 'presidential', 'impersonations', 'Spartans', 'sketch', '34', 'Get', 'Shed', '34', 'are', 'far', 'laziest', '34', 'SNL', '34', 'best-of', 'time.The', 'saddest', 'thing', 'three', 'volumes', 'Ferrell', 'best', 'stuff', 'still', ""n't"", 'been', 'represented', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'had', 'three', 'dvd', 'now', 'Neil', 'Diamond', '34', 'Storytellers', '34', 'fourth', 'volume', 'inevitable', 'then', '34', 'SNL', '34', 'had', 'better', 'do', 'hoemwork']",Saturday Night Live: The Best of Will Ferrell - Volume 3
