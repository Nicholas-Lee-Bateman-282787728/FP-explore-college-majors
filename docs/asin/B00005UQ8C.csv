I think that was 1981 or so. I think he is certainly the best guitarist in the world at what he does.This DVD captures the spirit of his act very well. It's just plain old fun. I don't think the camera work is the greatest, but I don't have any issues with the sound mix at all. If you have a good system, it'll sound great. A couple of multi camera options allow you to see his finger work during a couple of the instrumentals. It's truly phenomenal.The band does a great job of swinging along with Brian on this one. They along with everyone in the crowd seem to having a great time at the concert, which makes it more enjoyable to watch at home. They even do a couple of Stray Cats numbers to great effect.Great band, great sound, great performance. If you like Brian Setzer, you'll love this disk. I don't think there's any doubt about that.

The song selection is great and if you have ever seen the BSO live, then you will definitely enjoy this DVD. The only complaint I have is, that there should have been more close up on Brian's guitar work. I love to watch him play during the live shows and this DVD does not show enough of his fantastic finger work.

684994,A33KJZ6GCAUKOV,B00005UQ8C,Ronald K. Goodenow,"[1, 1]","When I was a kid I formed and led a big band, influenced by the excitement of Count Basie, Duke, Stan Kenton, and Benny Goodman. So, I am always looking for signs that 'big bands are back.' Well, this dvd is a very hopeful sign. Brian Setzer is something of an Elvis on steroids. Ok, that's said. But the guy has put together a big band that supports both his rock style and, happily, efforts to just plain swing. And swing he does on Duke Ellington's Caravan (grammy winner), Glenn Miller's Pennsylvania 6-5000 and In the Mood, and the old standard Get me to the Church on time. This band is a precision outfit that enjoys what it does, and creates the kind of excitement I associate with Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. Oh, and Setzer plays a mean guitar and who can resist his tatooes, rather devilish crooning smile and showmanship.Quibbles. The video is fine, but at times the orchestra itself is not well miked -- there's a crush of volume that blurs section and solo work (some fabulous bass playing and drumming here). In sum, it's fun to watch the excited Japanese audience, and well oiled performers. Let's hope this fine dvd persuades Setzer to put this outfit on the road here in the US.",4,An acquired taste -- and worth it,1018656000,"04 13, 2002",2002,1194,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'formed', 'led', 'big', 'band', 'influenced', 'excitement', 'Count', 'Basie', 'Duke', 'Stan', 'Kenton', 'Benny', 'Goodman', 'So', 'am', 'always', 'looking', 'signs', ""'big"", 'bands', 'are', 'back', 'Well', 'dvd', 'very', 'hopeful', 'sign', 'Brian', 'Setzer', 'something', 'Elvis', 'steroids', 'Ok', 'said', 'guy', 'put', 'together', 'big', 'band', 'rock', 'style', 'happily', 'efforts', 'just', 'plain', 'swing', 'swing', 'Duke', 'Ellington', 'Caravan', 'grammy', 'winner', 'Glenn', 'Miller', 'Pennsylvania', '6-5000', 'Mood', 'old', 'standard', 'Get', 'Church', 'time', 'band', 'precision', 'outfit', 'what', 'kind', 'excitement', 'associate', 'Buddy', 'Rich', 'Gene', 'Krupa', 'Oh', 'Setzer', 'mean', 'guitar', 'who', 'can', 'resist', 'tatooes', 'rather', 'devilish', 'crooning', 'smile', 'showmanship.Quibbles', 'video', 'fine', 'times', 'orchestra', 'not', 'well', 'miked', 'crush', 'volume', 'section', 'solo', 'work', 'fabulous', 'bass', 'playing', 'drumming', 'here', 'sum', 'fun', 'watch', 'excited', 'Japanese', 'audience', 'well', 'oiled', 'performers', 'Let', 'hope', 'fine', 'dvd', 'persuades', 'Setzer', 'put', 'outfit', 'road', 'here', 'US']",N/A
