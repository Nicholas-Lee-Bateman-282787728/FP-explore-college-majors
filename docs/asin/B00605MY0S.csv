Only in the end of the movie can you understand that it is not. It's an actual prequel to the Thing.The morphing of the creatures is not the same as in the remake of the original movie.  I am not jumpy on fantasy/horror movies and I do not like gore. However this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.Pros: Amazing graphics (not looking cartoonish or too computerized). Good set of actors (However I didn't love them, they acted good). First, iw as thinking there would be two main heroes through the whole movie. I was wrong. And I was thinking there would be a romance between the main heroes. I was wrong again. It would be unnecessary and there are plenty of other things to show in the movie. Glad that didn't happen. Director seemed to make a good job overall. With minor ''I wish it was different or I wish it was that way''. More and more people will get a chance to see John Carpenter's classic. Since it is one of the best movies I ever saw, I am very happy.Cons: For 100.000 years an alien didn't seem to be buried deep enough under ice like it's spacecraft. In one scene a guy gets a stick. Question is why didn't they show how he got it. Not too much of a big deal, but they didn't show it. Guess they were really busy or inspired witht the movie. I forgive that. Next is the storm. We didn't see it. It was a good weather all the time. The next thing is everything that goes after going into the speceship. Wish the alien didn't have the face on the front but somewhere on the rib side. That way the humans face wouldn't be the center of everything. It's an alien we should be looking at not the dead human. If we wanted to know who it was we could look on any other side of aliens body. And it was already obvious who turned out to be an alien. The next thing is the grenade part and miraculous. Please, that's too Holliwood. The main actress couldn't have escaped easily and grabbed the grenade and kill an alien. I will not spoil how she saved herself. Watch the movie.Overall it is enjoyable, very well made movie. I have to give it 5 stars. It's a great prequel and now I really want to see a movie that goes on what happened after John Carpenter's remake. And of course not just some alien movie, but what will inspire us further.It's a movie that should be owned on dvd or blueray! I've been waiting a year for it, since I first heard of it.

1506048,A1VWWTCCFU8EVQ,B00605MY0S,A Customer,"[0, 0]","I love the original John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). I remember staying in my seat in the cinema to watch it again. To take on this huge task of making a prequel is not easy because whatever film you create it's going to be compared to the original. It's even more difficult because you have to include discoveries from the original Norwegian facility and be sure to transfer them 30 years later.Directed by Matthijs Van Heijningen, who's industry background is commercials, television and this is his first major feature film. I liked the first few minutes, but from such a dramatic start you wonder how the three characters involved survived. There was no verbal or visual explanation, it was just ignored which was a little distracting. There is a lack of preparation with this production. In the 1982 original they discover many video tapes, all in Norwegian, this was brushed over because many tapes would indicate a long investigative time frame and this prequel ignores this major clue by being a little rushed. The other oversight is the way people interacted in the 1980's, especially towards women in the workplace. If they did the research by watching films of the time they could have picked up a few pointers to get the social aspect, look and feel, just right. I did not believe the story was set 30 years ago, it was a little 2011. The same has to be said for the look of the main female character `Kate Lloyd' (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead who was John McLane's daughter in Die Hard 4.0).I have experienced conditions in Canada's winter where you can't walk around outside because you can feel the cold cutting into your face. Conditions in the Antarctic are far more extreme, the Norwegian outpost surroundings could have been more treacherous creating an unbearable claustrophobic environment. If you take on a project like this, which has such a cult following and great memories for so many, you need to have bleeding edge attention to detail in order to stand out best from the rest. I wanted this film to work so much and despite my observations and creative suggestions I did enjoy the ride. To be balanced there are explanations of direct links to the original which are brilliant. One is the huge empty ice block Kurt Russell finds in the original and the burnt two headed `thing' that they bring back for a post mortem. The other great moments are the fantastic creature effects. Today's special effects are pure magic and they morph match perfectly. We all love the fact the original was more hands on without computer generated effects, but it's all about the end result on screen and not how they got there. The story would have improved if it focused on the characters reactions and trauma to the unspeakable mutations and morphing happening before their eyes.The ending feels like a last minute attempt to tie things together and the spaceship scene destroyed the mystery of the original. However, this film is worth seeing because of the moments they get just right, especially when the `Thing' decides to make its appearances. If `The Thing' (2011) was a modern day, 30 years later, sequel it would have given the writers and producers a more creative blank canvas. The idea to create a prequel unfortunately set them up for a huge challenge where they failed, but all involved can certainly hold their heads up high for a brave effort in trying.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com",3,bleedingfilms.com review of 'THE THING' (2011),1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,3417,"['love', 'original', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Thing', '1982', 'remember', 'staying', 'seat', 'cinema', 'watch', 'again', 'take', 'huge', 'task', 'making', 'prequel', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'create', 'going', 'be', 'compared', 'original', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'have', 'include', 'discoveries', 'original', 'Norwegian', 'facility', 'be', 'sure', 'transfer', '30', 'years', 'later.Directed', 'Matthijs', 'Van', 'Heijningen', 'who', 'industry', 'background', 'commercials', 'television', 'first', 'major', 'feature', 'film', 'liked', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'such', 'dramatic', 'start', 'wonder', 'how', 'three', 'characters', 'involved', 'survived', 'was', 'verbal', 'visual', 'explanation', 'was', 'just', 'ignored', 'was', 'little', 'distracting', 'lack', 'preparation', 'production', '1982', 'original', 'discover', 'many', 'video', 'tapes', 'Norwegian', 'was', 'brushed', 'many', 'tapes', 'would', 'indicate', 'long', 'investigative', 'time', 'frame', 'prequel', 'major', 'clue', 'being', 'little', 'rushed', 'other', 'oversight', 'way', 'people', 'interacted', '1980', 'especially', 'towards', 'women', 'workplace', 'did', 'research', 'watching', 'films', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'few', 'pointers', 'get', 'social', 'aspect', 'look', 'feel', 'just', 'right', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'story', 'was', 'set', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'little', '2011', 'same', 'be', 'said', 'look', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'Kate', 'Lloyd', 'played', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'who', 'was', 'John', 'McLane', 'daughter', 'Die', 'Hard', '4.0', '.I', 'have', 'experienced', 'conditions', 'Canada', 'winter', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'outside', 'can', 'feel', 'cold', 'cutting', 'face', 'Conditions', 'Antarctic', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'extreme', 'Norwegian', 'outpost', 'surroundings', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'treacherous', 'creating', 'unbearable', 'claustrophobic', 'environment', 'take', 'project', 'cult', 'following', 'great', 'memories', 'so', 'many', 'need', 'have', 'bleeding', 'edge', 'attention', 'detail', 'order', 'stand', 'out', 'best', 'rest', 'wanted', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'much', 'observations', 'creative', 'suggestions', 'did', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'be', 'balanced', 'are', 'explanations', 'direct', 'links', 'original', 'are', 'brilliant', 'One', 'huge', 'empty', 'ice', 'block', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'original', 'burnt', 'two', 'headed', 'thing', 'bring', 'back', 'post', 'mortem', 'other', 'great', 'moments', 'are', 'fantastic', 'creature', 'effects', 'Today', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pure', 'magic', 'morph', 'match', 'perfectly', 'love', 'fact', 'original', 'was', 'more', 'hands', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'end', 'result', 'screen', 'not', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'focused', 'characters', 'reactions', 'trauma', 'unspeakable', 'mutations', 'morphing', 'happening', 'eyes.The', 'ending', 'feels', 'last', 'minute', 'attempt', 'tie', 'things', 'together', 'spaceship', 'scene', 'destroyed', 'mystery', 'original', 'However', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'moments', 'get', 'just', 'right', 'especially', 'when', 'Thing', 'decides', 'make', 'appearances', 'Thing', '2011', 'was', 'modern', 'day', '30', 'years', 'later', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'writers', 'producers', 'more', 'creative', 'blank', 'canvas', 'idea', 'create', 'prequel', 'unfortunately', 'set', 'up', 'huge', 'challenge', 'where', 'failed', 'involved', 'can', 'certainly', 'hold', 'heads', 'up', 'high', 'brave', 'effort', 'trying.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com']",N/A
1506049,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,B00605MY0S,A customer,"[2, 3]","(Spoilerless review) Having just watched ""Kon Tiki"", it seems Norway's Viking descendants are still busy exploring the globe.  This time they're in an Antarctic ice-station in a prequel to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". I avoided this movie for a couple years because of bad reviews, and after watching it I'm not sure why. While not as good as Carpenter's version (what is?) and with a few problems, this is still a 4 star movie that works on many levels and should only receive complaints if you're not a fan of the genre. You don't need to have seen Carpenter's movie to watch this in any way.Pros:(1) Almost seamless prequel. They paid a lot of attention to detail to recreate sets and to authentically fill in the gaps that led up to the JC film.(2) Cast a strong female lead that isn't running around in skimpy outfits or showing up in an obligatory shower scene. This was smart too so that they weren't having to draw comparison's to the male MacCready from the JC version. They knew the prequel would fail if it just seemed liked a straight remake, and they successfully avoided that.(3) Where there were similar scenes they made them different enough to keep your interest.  Rather than do a straight blood test scene like in JC (spoiler alert), they instead have people looking into each other's mouths with flashlights to see who had dental fillings to determine who was human or not.  This was just as suspenseful as the original, and managed to be both ""the same"" and ""different"" at the same time. Great line: ""So I get killed because I floss?""(4) Several coy references to the ""Alien"" franchise, so there is fun not just comparing different versions of The Thing but also to those movies as well. The female lead is not Ripley per se, but you'll spot the homages along the way.Cons:(1) Where the plot did suffer it was because it was trying too hard to account for everything from the JC film.  Towards the end of the movie when dealing with the spaceship is really when it starts to lose it. I think they would have avoided all plot problems if they didn't feel they had to address the ship. But they would have been equally criticized if they did ""pick and choose"" and left something unaddressed.(2) CGI - While nowhere near as poor as some people claimed (and equal to most 2010 CGI out there), there were two bad shots in particular.  It could also not compete with all of JC's old puppets.  At the end of the day though, so what? Complaints of poor CGI here are overblown, and animatronics were still used in conjuction.(3) Subtitles - Not really a con in my mind, I only list it here because some have complained about it. The vast majority of the film is in English, and having the Norwegians talk to each other in their own language helped them to keep secrets from the Americans and lend to the distrust/paranoia that is part of the film.(4) Did it feel a little rushed? To me, yes, but it was still well paced. I like slower movies, but that is not what the market is dictating these days. Would have been nice to see a directors cut, but the deleted scene bonus features don't go far enough in that regard.The Bluray looks good, the soundtrack works well, and bonus feature wise you have some obligatory ""making of"" vignettes. The commentary overtrack from the director was very worthwhile and I watched it all the way through, providing interesting insight/trivia from both this and the JC film.Bottom line, this was a better prequel than say ""Prometheus"" was to Alien and overall adds to the franchise. Manage your expectations and enjoy.

1506050,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,B00605MY0S,Adam B. Krenn,"[12, 21]","I am all for adding to a mythos but that doesn't mean it is always a good thing (no pun intended).How can one rate this film without looking at the John Carpenter version? Since it is meant as a direct prequel, I would argue that you can't. So, from an the point of view of one of the members of the expedition (which was John Carpenter's intent)let's give an overview of that version:An antarctic research crew encounters a being which can mimic anyone or anything it absorbs (and summarily duplicates). It turns out that this being is extraterrestrial in origin and is both cunning and pretty successful as an ambush predator, not to mention very intelligent. It is the ultimate ninja (not the video game kind) as it patiently waits, bides its time and methodically begins taking over whomever it can. It acts with intelligence and foresight by absorbing/assuming individuals as it can and only ONLY acting in direct opposition when cornered, exposed or weak. But even then it has a back-up plan. When it ambushed Bennings and was discovered part way through, it (as the Thing was also at least Palmer and Norris by this time) acted against itself to protect the greater whole. Now none of this is to say the Thing didn't make some mistakes. It did attack the dogs under the assumption that it would be able to successfully absorb all of them. The noise worked against it in that case. The point being is the Thing acted with intelligence as a thinking being would do and was under the same (or very similar) physical limitations as terrestrial creatures. Even the finale blatantly suggested that freezing was now its plan as a rescue team would likely show up eventually taking it to more civilized areas.Now here comes The Thing (2011), the prequel the the 1982 John Carpenter version which deals with the Norwegian Camp's experiences. Did not have any problem with any of the actors. Felt Mary Elizabeth Winstead was great for her part. The film itself? Hmm, let's see, early in the film they find the block of ice containing the Thing. It then breaks out of the ice? Really? So it freezes because it can't do anything else but then breaks out of the ice because, what, it didn't really need to allow itself to freeze in the first place. I am confused at this point. As the film progresses, one of the Things is now in a helicopter being taken away from the Norwegian camp which would eventually lead to more civilized areas (**Edit: I stand corrected, the helicopter was called back to the base before the Thing attacked. I still feel the attack in the air goes against how the Thing normally acted as both patient hunter and intelligent creature). So instead of biding its time it attacks the helicopter crew and allowing itself to crash and be trapped back at the Norwegian camp? Really? I guess the whole intelligent being idea was totally scrapped. I did like the idea that it can't replicate artificial parts (i.e. fillings and knees replacements) but then it decides to ambush our Hero Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the most profoundly clumsy and noisy way possible? Really? Which of course does not succeed and puts everyone that wasn't already on edge, in total Red Alert mode. I'm sorry, the film came off the rails pretty quick in Act II. What followed was just a loud, noisy action film with plenty of monster hi-jinx and scene match-ups with the 1982 version of The Thing when they travel to the Norwegian camp.Ultimately a failure in my opinion, due to the plot, writing or whatever mechanism completely stripped our villain (i.e. The Thing) of any true intellect and cunning. Again, while the performances were all solid it ended up being a pretty heartless outing overall and not worthy of its title.

1506051,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00605MY0S,A. Estes,"[2, 4]","Remakes are one thing, but remakes masked as prequels to remakes from the `80s? Now that's a whole new ballgame. ""The Thing,"" despite its similarity in title to John Carpenter's cult-classic 1982 film is actually a prequel. But it's also a remake. Make sense? Of course not. Just go with it. The basic premise will sound familiar: a group of scientists holed away in the bowels of Antarctica make an earth (err, ice) shattering discovery that soon proves to be a deadly threat.  It turns out a foreign life-form found buried in the ice is actually a lethal shape-shifting monster that consumes and then replicates its hosts, turning the entire crew on each other one by one. However, this story concerns the Norwegians whose mess Kurt Russell and crew were left to clean up in the original (remake).So how does it fare when compared to the coat-tails it's riding? Well, it's a mixed-bag, really. While Carpenter's film is notorious for boasting some ground-breaking practical effects that still hold up rather well 30 years later, this version will likely be remember for having quite possibly some of the laziest and most blatantly obvious CGI committed to mainstream cinema in recent memory. There are some truly grisly moments in the film that are virtually neutered by their presentation, which is perhaps the film's greatest short-coming. Granted, it doesn't help that the plot moves so quickly that you never get a chance to get to know (or care) about the crew, but a little more effort spent on making the effects look authentic would have gone a long way.On the upside, Dutch director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. has a strong visual sense that pays off big time. Granted, an isolated snowbound setting almost creates its own atmosphere, but the film does a superb job of immersing you in the bleakness of the situation, much in the same way Carpenter did with his film. Also in the film's favor is Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Final Destination 3, Death Proof) who is essentially stepping in Kurt Russell's shoes. While her character is barely expanded upon, she brings enough gravity to keep you caring. As the film shows, Winstead is truly one of Hollywood's most underused talents. In perhaps a more refined film, she could be this generation's Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton.The thing of it is (see what I did there?) that ""The Thing"" is neither a great nor a bad movie. It exists solely to serve a specific fanbase: namely Carpenter enthusiasts who have seen the 1982 film enough that they can quote the characters by heart. To that end, the film feels like a decent piece of fan-fiction come to life. As far as remakes go (and believe me, there's some bad remakes of Carpenter films on the market), this one is on the higher end of the scale. If you can get past the fact that it's essentially the Diet Coke version of a bonafide classic, you might get some thrills out of this new ""Thing.""",3,A Diet Coke Version of a Carpenter Classic,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,2905,"['Remakes', 'are', 'one', 'thing', 'masked', 'prequels', 'remakes', '80s', 'Now', 'whole', 'new', 'ballgame', 'Thing', 'similarity', 'title', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'cult-classic', '1982', 'film', 'actually', 'prequel', 'also', 'remake', 'Make', 'sense', 'course', 'not', 'Just', 'go', 'basic', 'premise', 'will', 'sound', 'familiar', 'group', 'scientists', 'holed', 'away', 'bowels', 'Antarctica', 'make', 'earth', 'err', 'ice', 'shattering', 'discovery', 'soon', 'be', 'deadly', 'threat', 'out', 'foreign', 'life-form', 'found', 'buried', 'ice', 'actually', 'lethal', 'shape-shifting', 'monster', 'consumes', 'then', 'hosts', 'turning', 'entire', 'crew', 'other', 'one', 'one', 'However', 'story', 'Norwegians', 'mess', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'crew', 'were', 'left', 'clean', 'up', 'original', 'remake', '.So', 'how', 'fare', 'when', 'compared', 'coat-tails', 'riding', 'Well', 'mixed-bag', 'really', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'notorious', 'boasting', 'ground-breaking', 'practical', 'effects', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'rather', 'well', '30', 'years', 'later', 'version', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'remember', 'having', 'quite', 'possibly', 'laziest', 'most', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'CGI', 'committed', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'recent', 'memory', 'are', 'truly', 'grisly', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'virtually', 'neutered', 'presentation', 'perhaps', 'film', 'greatest', 'short-coming', 'Granted', ""n't"", 'help', 'plot', 'moves', 'so', 'quickly', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'care', 'crew', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'spent', 'making', 'effects', 'look', 'authentic', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way.On', 'upside', 'Dutch', 'director', 'Matthijs', 'van', 'Heijningen', 'Jr.', 'strong', 'visual', 'sense', 'big', 'time', 'Granted', 'isolated', 'snowbound', 'setting', 'almost', 'own', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'superb', 'job', 'immersing', 'bleakness', 'situation', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Carpenter', 'did', 'film', 'Also', 'film', 'favor', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'Death', 'Proof', 'who', 'essentially', 'stepping', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'shoes', 'character', 'barely', 'expanded', 'upon', 'enough', 'gravity', 'keep', 'caring', 'film', 'shows', 'Winstead', 'truly', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'underused', 'talents', 'perhaps', 'more', 'refined', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'generation', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Linda', 'Hamilton.The', 'thing', 'see', 'what', 'did', 'there', 'Thing', 'great', 'bad', 'movie', 'solely', 'serve', 'specific', 'fanbase', 'namely', 'Carpenter', 'enthusiasts', 'who', 'have', 'seen', '1982', 'film', 'can', 'quote', 'characters', 'heart', 'end', 'film', 'feels', 'decent', 'piece', 'fan-fiction', 'come', 'life', 'As', 'far', 'remakes', 'go', 'believe', 'bad', 'remakes', 'Carpenter', 'films', 'market', 'one', 'higher', 'end', 'scale', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'essentially', 'Diet', 'Coke', 'version', 'bonafide', 'classic', 'might', 'get', 'thrills', 'new', 'Thing']",N/A

The second time I watched it on blu ray I really liked it and became more engrossed in the nuances. I'm a huge fan of the 1982 Thing (as well as the 1951 version)so I believe I come at this being a hard core skeptic. As with the 1983 film this version has a very real dynamic going on between the cloistered players. Mary Elizabeth Winstead impressed the heck out of me portraying an outwardly bland scientist that invokes inner strength when confronted with fear. As well, her fear is genuine.Many already know this 2011 version is a prequel. I didn't think the Norwgian camp needed to be revisited but, my predilections aside, it worked very well. Many of the actors are big Norwegian film stars. One was referred to as the ""Brad Pitt"" of Norway in the dvd extras. The film basically holds to what our minds remember the creature being in the ""82 masterpiece and that goes a long way. I do agree with some reviewers that one or two CGI scenes were somewhat weak but it could also be that I am so used to the thing being ""live action"" that the CGI just throws me off for this type of creature. I would also say that some necessary dark scenes leaned a little too dark for me. I also don't understand why the film was given the title ""The Thing"". Remakes are usually entitled the same, not prequels or sequels. This could have been ""The Thing- A Beginning"" or something like that. I think the marketers needed this title to sell it to newer audiences.The movie doesn't have the memorable lines that the classic has but I can't forget the line, ""be careful, that thing went through the ------ roof"" (lol). Seeing the creatures space ship could have sunk the film but wisely this area was handled smoothly and added greater fascination. Kate's outcome left me a bit more wanting but I can live with it.

When the alien promptly escapes its icy prison and begins taking the form of the various researchers, jump scares and gore ensue.

I will say that the special effects are quite good and the performances fine, especially when the actors have such little to work with. this is because of the afforementioned flaws in the Things's lazy script, which is strictly sci-fi channel original-level. even the generic ""will you go on this mission"" scene happens immediately after the prologue, with seven minutes passed, and not a single conversation taken place. come to think of it, I don't recall a single conversation in The Thing. by-the-numbers it may be, there still are a few scary scenes to be had. the movie finally hits a stride about halfway through, and delivers the goods for a while before slowing down again with the uninspired, ridiculous final scenes. winstead falls down feet by the dozens (you can hear her screaming for a good 7 seconds)and gets up miraculously unharmed. when she is subsequently being pursued by the monster, she comes whithin easy reach of its writhing tentacles while hiding around the corner... still unharmed! (of course in any other movie, the monster would have reached around the corner where she would be waiting at the end of the hall) I call this questionable star treatment for someone I only know about because of Final Destination 3. the real star here needs to be eric christian olsen, a talented and underrated actor who has starred (consistently) in worse films than this. dude needs ambition. or maybe just a new agent. all in all, the thing is a film that will probably please horror fans, especially ones of the john carpenter original. but for everyone else, well, let's just say the people who say things along the lines of ""oh great, another horror flick"" while watching the trailers in theaters are not wrong about this one",2,"Where have we seen this one before? oh, yeah...",1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,2636,"['PREQUEL', 'was', 'fan', 'john', 'carpenter', 'original', 'unavoidable', 'say', 'making', 'film', 'one', 'identical', 'plot', 'face-absorbing', 'scene', 're-used', 'archtypes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grace', 'anyone', 'else', 'movie', 'calling', 'characters', 'husky', 'also', 'eaten', 'cell', 'even', 'title', 'not', 'prequel', 'make', 'ironically', 'one', 'few', 'real', 'differences', 'monster', 'same', 'abilities', 'one', 'original', 'different', 'credibility', 'relation', 'first', 'film', 'aside', 'movie', 'formulaic', 'thinly', 'scripted', 'ultimately', 'forgettable', 'characters', 'personalities', 'are', 'barely', 'established', 'not', 'show', 'personality', 'traits', 'film', 'anyway', 'save', 'one', 'bit', 'where', 'eric', 'christian', 'olsen', 'never', 'believed', '@', 'referring', 'aliens', 'guy', 'next', 'colorfully', 'always', 'believed', 'aliens', 'will', 'say', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'performances', 'fine', 'especially', 'when', 'actors', 'have', 'such', 'little', 'work', 'afforementioned', 'flaws', 'Things', 'lazy', 'script', 'strictly', 'sci-fi', 'channel', 'original-level', 'even', 'generic', 'will', 'go', 'mission', 'scene', 'immediately', 'prologue', 'seven', 'minutes', 'passed', 'not', 'single', 'conversation', 'taken', 'place', 'come', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'single', 'conversation', 'Thing', 'by-the-numbers', 'may', 'be', 'still', 'are', 'few', 'scary', 'scenes', 'be', 'had', 'movie', 'finally', 'stride', 'halfway', 'goods', 'while', 'slowing', 'down', 'again', 'uninspired', 'ridiculous', 'final', 'scenes', 'winstead', 'down', 'feet', 'dozens', 'can', 'hear', 'screaming', 'good', '7', 'seconds', 'up', 'miraculously', 'unharmed', 'when', 'subsequently', 'being', 'pursued', 'monster', 'whithin', 'easy', 'reach', 'writhing', 'tentacles', 'hiding', 'corner', 'still', 'unharmed', 'course', 'other', 'movie', 'monster', 'would', 'have', 'reached', 'corner', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'waiting', 'end', 'hall', 'call', 'questionable', 'star', 'treatment', 'someone', 'only', 'know', 'Final', 'Destination', '3.', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'be', 'eric', 'christian', 'olsen', 'talented', 'underrated', 'actor', 'who', 'starred', 'consistently', 'worse', 'films', 'dude', 'ambition', 'maybe', 'just', 'new', 'agent', 'thing', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'please', 'horror', 'fans', 'especially', 'ones', 'john', 'carpenter', 'original', 'everyone', 'else', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'things', 'lines', 'oh', 'great', 'horror', 'flick', 'watching', 'trailers', 'theaters', 'are', 'not', 'wrong', 'one']",N/A

1506060,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B00605MY0S,Andre Dursin,"[3, 4]","Respectful, and nicely mounted, prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 take on the John W. Campbell, Jr. story ""Who Goes There?"" offers decent monster thrills on an old-fashioned level.The lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as an American scientist whisked away to Antarctica in order to study a Norwegian crew's find of the century: a massive alien craft entombed in the ice...and a survivor frozen nearby, outside the craft. Unbeknownst to Winstead and her mostly nameless companions, once the extraterrestrial thaws out, it's able to swallow its prey whole and reanimate itself in the guise of another life form.Eric Heisserer's script includes a couple of nice touches that Carpenter and his screenwriter Bill Lancaster missed in the `82 version - namely, that the alien can't replicate inorganic matter like tooth fillings - but for the most part is content to rehash its predecessor's principal set-pieces, thereby serving as more of a remake than anything else. Consequently, fans of the original ""Thing"" are likely to be bored with what amounts to a serviceable, yet uninspired, reworking of scenes from the Carpenter film (the blood test, etc.), though at least director Matthjs van Hejningen visually pays tribute to its predecessor with an effective mix of CGI and Alec Gillis/Tom Woodruff make-up replicating Rob Bottin's legendary work from the 1982 picture. The human element of the film, though, never pays off with threadbare character beats, though I'd be happy watching Winstead in pretty much anything - she manages to be attractive and convincing here, and the only distinguishing element in an otherwise bland acting ensemble.Universal's Blu-Ray of the 2011 ""Thing"" looks tremendous with a high-quality VC-1 encoded transfer. The DTS MA sound is constantly active with Marco Beltrami's score boasting the occasional flourish of Ennio Morricone's 1982 theme. Extras include a few deleted scenes, featurettes and commentary from the filmmakers, along with a digital copy and standard DVD edition.",3,"Not a Classic, Not a Disaster -- Just a Decent ""Creature Feature""",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2011,"['Respectful', 'nicely', 'mounted', 'prequel', 'John', 'Carpenter', '1982', 'take', 'John', 'W.', 'Campbell', 'Jr.', 'story', 'Who', 'decent', 'monster', 'thrills', 'old-fashioned', 'level.The', 'lovely', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'American', 'scientist', 'whisked', 'away', 'Antarctica', 'order', 'study', 'Norwegian', 'crew', 'find', 'century', 'massive', 'alien', 'craft', 'entombed', 'ice', 'survivor', 'frozen', 'nearby', 'craft', 'Unbeknownst', 'Winstead', 'mostly', 'nameless', 'companions', 'once', 'extraterrestrial', 'thaws', 'able', 'swallow', 'prey', 'whole', 'reanimate', 'guise', 'life', 'form.Eric', 'Heisserer', 'script', 'couple', 'nice', 'touches', 'Carpenter', 'screenwriter', 'Bill', 'Lancaster', 'missed', '82', 'version', 'namely', 'alien', 'ca', ""n't"", 'replicate', 'inorganic', 'matter', 'fillings', 'most', 'part', 'content', 'rehash', 'predecessor', 'principal', 'set-pieces', 'thereby', 'serving', 'more', 'remake', 'anything', 'else', 'Consequently', 'fans', 'original', 'Thing', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'bored', 'what', 'amounts', 'serviceable', 'yet', 'uninspired', 'reworking', 'scenes', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'blood', 'test', 'etc', 'though', 'least', 'director', 'Matthjs', 'van', 'Hejningen', 'visually', 'tribute', 'predecessor', 'effective', 'mix', 'CGI', 'Alec', 'Gillis/Tom', 'Woodruff', 'make-up', 'replicating', 'Rob', 'Bottin', 'legendary', 'work', '1982', 'picture', 'human', 'element', 'film', 'though', 'never', 'threadbare', 'character', 'beats', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'watching', 'Winstead', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'be', 'attractive', 'convincing', 'here', 'only', 'distinguishing', 'element', 'otherwise', 'bland', 'acting', 'ensemble.Universal', 'Blu-Ray', '2011', 'Thing', 'tremendous', 'high-quality', 'VC-1', 'encoded', 'transfer', 'DTS', 'MA', 'sound', 'constantly', 'active', 'Marco', 'Beltrami', 'score', 'boasting', 'occasional', 'flourish', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', '1982', 'theme', 'Extras', 'include', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'digital', 'copy', 'standard', 'DVD', 'edition']",N/A

They surely weren't as action-packed or suspenseful as this one.It's about a group of researchers who travel to Antarctica and dig up an alien stuck in the ice.  Well you can probably guess what happens next- the darn thing literally launches itself out of the ice and comes to life in grand, human-morphing fashion!  It's up to the research team (starring the extra cute Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and their trusty selection of flamethrowers to put out the threat, however there's a catch.These aliens can actually replicate human beings and specifically, members of the research team, which means the entire team is constantly under careful examination.  If something appears to be off just a *little* bit about their behavior -or the fact that aliens can't replicate the fillings in teeth- guess what happens to them?  As the old Mortal Kombat video game used to say, ""Toasty!""  Time to take out the flamethrower and go to town!Entertainment starting about 20 minutes in and continuing until the very end- these aliens will pop up around the frozen facility during several surprising moments and wreak havoc on anyone that stands in their way.  I have to admit, the Exorcist-influenced ""crawling backwards"" motion of the aliens was really horrific and terrifying on a personal level.  Added to the fact is that the HEADS of the people the aliens were replicating were always attached to the front of the aliens body, and it's just really juicy and gross!

It was found due to a magnetic disturbance. On extraction there is an accident.  We find a being from another world and another time.  The being has powers of deception and shape shifting.  Yet the story is not really of supernatural beings as it is of the people and their relationship to each other. As with many great mysteries it is always the last person you suspect.

Naturally it complied with the monster movies of the time and starred James Arness in a veggie suit. It was lots of fun, spooky and had some of the original electrical devices from the book. If you like fifties sci-fi, do not miss this one.This effort was made as a prequel to the1982 Carpenter version when the monster moved from veggie suits to cheap graphics. The graphic tradition is kept on this presentation. There was a need for the story to be fleshed out and Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. did better at portraying people as people than Carpenter did.Still the story was fluffed out with Carpenter esque story telling and misses the point of the book and the film spends too much time with blood and guts to focus on the people interaction.

The 2011 prequel to John Carpenter's classic Science Fiction film THE THING is surprisingly well-made, and serves as a valid companion piece to the original film by filling in the events that preceded it. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and his team of set designers have taken great care in recreating the Norwegian base camp and following the frightful events just as they had been described in the previous film. The one major disadvantage that anyone would come to expect falls in the special effects department. Rob Bottin's ground-breaking make-up designs have terrified audiences since 1982, but the computerized monstrosities found here lose much of their effect despite their nasty appearances. Although THE THING presents several new twists on the plot points from before, the plagiarized ideas border quite closely to making this a direct remake.

1506090,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00605MY0S,C. Sawin,"[1, 2]","John Carpenter's version of The Thing is a horror classic that has not only stood the test of time, but is considered by many to be one of the best horror movies ever. The desire to return to the 1982 film to attempt and capture a similar atmosphere in a modern motion picture is understandable, but the journey is likely to not only tarnish its reputation but weaken the impact it once had. Despite being held in such high regard, it's not like The Thing is a huge money maker. The 1982 film didn't even break $20 million at the domestic box office and didn't really become a success until it was released on VHS. Fast forward nearly thirty years and a new version of The Thing has covertly made its way into theaters or at least that's what it would like to lead you to believe.The Thing has a pretty decent opening. What's a modern day R-rated horror movie without a really terrible raunchy joke to break the ice (pun intended) minutes before everything hits the fan? The scenery is kind of breathtaking, as well. The roaming shot that opens the film where we see many of the snow caps in ""Antarctica"" along with most of the scenic shots are fairly beautiful. There's something about vast, snowy landscapes and icy structures that's mesmerizing.The special effects are probably the main reason to see The Thing. Many horror fans that have seen the prequel are upset that the film relied so much on CG, but I found them rather extraordinary. There's a mix of both practical effects and computer generation for a result that is both gnarly and out of this world. It's not so much that CG is so relevant in films nowadays that turns me off of it it's the amount of cheap-looking CG that constantly gets used. In regards to living up to Carpenter's film, The Thing came closest with how the creature looked. That along with how everything happening seemed to explain events in the 1982 version are a drawing factor. The Thing feels like a remake, but the events that unfold explain what happened leading up to the opening shot in Carpenter's film. The sound effects also at least make the film worth a viewing in the theater. The creature's sounds alone are pretty intense. The score wasn't necessarily memorable, but was just subtle enough and just enough to put you on the edge to add a little bit to the film. Lastly, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the most decent part of the cast. She's no R.J. MacReady, but she has the most developed personality.Unfortunately The Thing pretty much has everyTHING working against it despite showing quite a bit of potential. It has the blandest dialogue. Everything is so boring and monotone. All of the characters feel one-dimensional, as well; paper thin. Character development is mostly nonexistent. The jump scares feel cheap and it's so dead set on staying close to Carpenter's vision that it isn't able to establish an identity of its own. The ""test"" in the prequel is beyond weak and the film's constant absence of logic becomes groan-worthy.In the 1982 film, Childs (Keith David) says at one point ""If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation, how would you know it was really me?"" This version of The Thing aspires to be a perfect imitation of Carpenter's version and it crashes and burns. It barely passes as an imperfect imitation. The way it relies on Carpenter's film as a crutch hurts it more than anything. However the special effects at least make it worth seeing in the theater. Although disappointing, The Thing is somewhat decent, better than what most review sites are giving it credit for, and moderately entertaining.",3,Better than what most give it credit for,1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,3573,"['John', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'Thing', 'horror', 'classic', 'not', 'only', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'ever', 'desire', 'return', '1982', 'film', 'attempt', 'capture', 'similar', 'atmosphere', 'modern', 'motion', 'picture', 'understandable', 'journey', 'likely', 'not', 'only', 'tarnish', 'reputation', 'weaken', 'impact', 'once', 'had', 'being', 'held', 'such', 'high', 'regard', 'not', 'Thing', 'huge', 'money', 'maker', '1982', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'break', '20', 'million', 'domestic', 'box', 'office', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'become', 'success', 'was', 'released', 'VHS', 'Fast', 'forward', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'new', 'version', 'Thing', 'covertly', 'made', 'way', 'theaters', 'least', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'lead', 'believe.The', 'Thing', 'pretty', 'decent', 'opening', 'What', 'modern', 'day', 'R-rated', 'horror', 'movie', 'really', 'terrible', 'raunchy', 'joke', 'break', 'ice', 'pun', 'intended', 'minutes', 'everything', 'fan', 'scenery', 'kind', 'breathtaking', 'as', 'well', 'roaming', 'shot', 'film', 'where', 'see', 'many', 'snow', 'caps', 'Antarctica', 'most', 'scenic', 'shots', 'are', 'fairly', 'beautiful', 'something', 'vast', 'snowy', 'landscapes', 'icy', 'structures', 'mesmerizing.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'Thing', 'Many', 'horror', 'fans', 'have', 'seen', 'prequel', 'are', 'upset', 'film', 'relied', 'so', 'much', 'CG', 'found', 'rather', 'extraordinary', 'mix', 'practical', 'effects', 'computer', 'generation', 'result', 'gnarly', 'world', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'CG', 'so', 'relevant', 'films', 'nowadays', 'amount', 'cheap-looking', 'CG', 'constantly', 'used', 'regards', 'living', 'up', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'Thing', 'came', 'closest', 'how', 'creature', 'looked', 'how', 'everything', 'happening', 'seemed', 'explain', 'events', '1982', 'version', 'are', 'drawing', 'factor', 'Thing', 'feels', 'remake', 'events', 'unfold', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'leading', 'up', 'opening', 'shot', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'sound', 'effects', 'also', 'least', 'make', 'film', 'viewing', 'theater', 'creature', 'sounds', 'alone', 'are', 'pretty', 'intense', 'score', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'memorable', 'was', 'just', 'subtle', 'enough', 'just', 'enough', 'put', 'edge', 'add', 'little', 'bit', 'film', 'Lastly', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'most', 'decent', 'part', 'cast', 'R.J.', 'MacReady', 'most', 'developed', 'personality.Unfortunately', 'Thing', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyTHING', 'working', 'showing', 'quite', 'bit', 'potential', 'blandest', 'dialogue', 'Everything', 'so', 'boring', 'monotone', 'characters', 'feel', 'one-dimensional', 'well', 'paper', 'thin', 'Character', 'development', 'mostly', 'nonexistent', 'jump', 'feel', 'cheap', 'so', 'dead', 'set', 'staying', 'close', 'Carpenter', 'vision', ""n't"", 'able', 'establish', 'identity', 'own', 'test', 'prequel', 'weak', 'film', 'constant', 'absence', 'logic', 'becomes', 'groan-worthy.In', '1982', 'film', 'Childs', 'Keith', 'David', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'imitation', 'perfect', 'imitation', 'how', 'would', 'know', 'was', 'really', 'version', 'Thing', 'aspires', 'be', 'perfect', 'imitation', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'crashes', 'burns', 'barely', 'imperfect', 'imitation', 'way', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'crutch', 'more', 'anything', 'However', 'special', 'effects', 'least', 'make', 'worth', 'seeing', 'theater', 'disappointing', 'Thing', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'better', 'what', 'most', 'review', 'sites', 'are', 'giving', 'credit', 'moderately', 'entertaining']",N/A

After all humans are largely just the sum of their/our memories,and this alien creature not only absorbs and assimilates our bodies but also our brains and memories to not only pass for human but as the specific individual it's using as its host...

1506098,ACPXNYGPXPKED,B00605MY0S,David N. Brown,"[5, 10]","The best I can say about this movie is that I liked it better than the 1951 ""Thing"". It strikes me as not so much a bad film as one that tries to be two things at once- in this case a sequel and a remake- and does neither well.  I see the following as particular problems:1.  The final scenes supposed to tie this film to the 1982 original simply don't make sense, either in relation to the earlier film or the events of this one.  I personally would need another viewing just to sort out who was even still alive.  This is the most obvious indication that the filmmakers would have been better off to drop the prequel pretense and just let it be a ""remake"" that could stand on its own.2.  The sequel v. remake conundrum shows even more in the conception of the creature.  As other reviewers have been pointing out very consistently, the Thing here doesn't act at all like the 1982 Thing.  In the earlier film, the Thing is a model of caution and stealth.  Here, it seems hellbent on eliminating or assimilating everyone as quickly as possible.  As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing wrong with this revisionist take on Thing behavior.  The problem for me is, it just isn't done well.  The speed of the Thing's onslaught doesn't leave much room for tension, never mind character development.  There isn't a sense of the Thing progressively revealing itself, as the first transformation of human to thing is little different from the ones that follow, and we see the ""original"" form (by far the most weakly conceived!) at the start.  And, ultimately, this Thing just doesn't seem like an effective fighter.  Like the 1951 creature, it can't seem to come up with a better strategy than rushing straight at a human.3.  I was disappointed in the use of Mary Winstead. Her character has the potential for a symbol of changing gender roles (the most promising subtext of the 1951 film), and one can at least give this film credit for letting a woman's competence and character speak for itself instead of pushing her into a romance subplot or a heavy-handed feminist manifesto.  But, ultimately, she isn't given that much to do, and at times the story comes perilously close to pushing her into the ""passive victim"" stereotype.  I must also say, Winstead herself doesn't convey the same energy or charm that made her stand out in ""Scott Pilgrim"".4.  Finally, I think the helicopter landings in the storyline are significant deviations from the ""set-up"".  If anything unifies the original story and the first two films based on it, it is a sense of isolation and claustrophobia.  This film clearly tries to have the same quality, but having helicopters repeatedly coming out of the sky goes a long way toward defeating it.",2,Call it a remake...,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,2718,"['best', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'liked', 'better', '1951', 'Thing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'film', 'one', 'be', 'two', 'things', 'once-', 'case', 'sequel', 'remake-', 'well', 'see', 'following', 'particular', 'problems:1', 'final', 'scenes', 'supposed', 'tie', 'film', '1982', 'original', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'either', 'relation', 'earlier', 'film', 'events', 'one', 'personally', 'would', 'need', 'viewing', 'just', 'sort', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'even', 'still', 'alive', 'most', 'obvious', 'indication', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'drop', 'prequel', 'pretense', 'just', 'let', 'be', 'remake', 'could', 'stand', 'own.2', 'sequel', 'v.', 'remake', 'conundrum', 'even', 'more', 'conception', 'creature', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'pointing', 'out', 'very', 'consistently', 'Thing', 'here', ""n't"", 'act', '1982', 'Thing', 'earlier', 'film', 'Thing', 'model', 'caution', 'stealth', 'Here', 'hellbent', 'eliminating', 'assimilating', 'everyone', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'revisionist', 'take', 'Thing', 'behavior', 'problem', 'just', ""n't"", 'done', 'well', 'speed', 'Thing', 'onslaught', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'room', 'tension', 'never', 'mind', 'character', 'development', ""n't"", 'sense', 'Thing', 'progressively', 'revealing', 'first', 'transformation', 'human', 'thing', 'little', 'different', 'ones', 'follow', 'see', 'original', 'form', 'far', 'most', 'weakly', 'conceived', 'start', 'ultimately', 'Thing', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'effective', 'fighter', '1951', 'creature', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'strategy', 'rushing', 'straight', 'human.3', 'was', 'disappointed', 'use', 'Mary', 'Winstead', 'character', 'potential', 'symbol', 'changing', 'gender', 'roles', 'most', 'promising', 'subtext', '1951', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'least', 'give', 'film', 'credit', 'letting', 'woman', 'competence', 'character', 'speak', 'instead', 'pushing', 'romance', 'subplot', 'heavy-handed', 'feminist', 'manifesto', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'given', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'times', 'story', 'perilously', 'close', 'pushing', 'passive', 'victim', 'stereotype', 'must', 'also', 'say', 'Winstead', ""n't"", 'convey', 'same', 'energy', 'charm', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', '.4', 'Finally', 'think', 'helicopter', 'landings', 'storyline', 'are', 'significant', 'deviations', 'set-up', 'anything', 'original', 'story', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'based', 'sense', 'isolation', 'claustrophobia', 'film', 'clearly', 'have', 'same', 'quality', 'having', 'helicopters', 'repeatedly', 'coming', 'sky', 'long', 'way', 'defeating']",N/A

Just like in the movie, my answer is ""yes I do"". Making a film this many years after a classic and trying to make the story before that movie is challenging. I had no great expectations for this film going into the theater. When watching The Thing from '82 you had to wonder about the Norwegians and the back story, thats why this film is interesting.Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Kate a paleontologist, brought to Antartica to help in bringing a frozen ""thing"" out of the ice. She starts out observing and asking questions while Dr. Halvorson conducts his analysis of the specimen. As the story unfolds however, its Kate that uses her head and leads the group. The question throughout the film is- who is human? Nobody is who they seem all the way til the end. And some people you think aren't human, turn out to be only to be different later. The effects and cgi are executed very well here. The examination of a consumed human within a thing is creepy. They even have to cut through a casing around the human- sick stuff. The star of the movie is definately Winstead, although the cast is collectively good. The casting was very good for a film that mixes characters from different countries. One of the best scenes in the movie is when the group gathers for a test to see who is human. This is where Winstead is at her best. Great work here.  And the best weapon against these things is THE FLAMETHROWER! Great action throughout the movie- you won't be disappointed. Theres even some time spent in the craft these visitors came to Antartica in. And you'll get that feeling of isolation and fear that the '82 movie was effective at. Not to mention not everyone speaks English which adds another dimension. What could be worse than being in the freezing cold, thousands of miles from civilization and  not knowing if the person next to you is human? The movie doesn't end with the credits. Most the people at the theater left at this time. But there is a bridging of this film straight into the '82 film. The dog being chased by the helicopter is here. ""Thats no dog!""Some production notes that I thought were interesting. There was a million screen captures of the '82 film on a lap top. That was used to create as close as possible, the Norwegian camp.  The film used practical effects as much as possible over CGI. The movie was shot in Toronto. The lead character of Kate was inspired by Weaver's character in the Aliens films. John Carpenter wanted to make an appearance in the film, but this didn't happen because of scheduling.4 1/2 stars",5,Do you really think thats a good idea??,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,2677,"['Thats', 'one', 'early', 'lines', 'film', 'Kate', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'asked', 'making', 'prequel', 'much', 'loved', ""'82"", 'classic', 'Just', 'movie', 'answer', 'yes', 'do', 'Making', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'classic', 'trying', 'make', 'story', 'movie', 'challenging', 'had', 'great', 'expectations', 'film', 'going', 'theater', 'When', 'watching', 'Thing', ""'82"", 'had', 'wonder', 'Norwegians', 'back', 'story', 'why', 'film', 'interesting.Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Kate', 'paleontologist', 'brought', 'Antartica', 'help', 'bringing', 'frozen', 'thing', 'ice', 'out', 'observing', 'asking', 'questions', 'Dr.', 'Halvorson', 'analysis', 'specimen', 'story', 'however', 'Kate', 'head', 'group', 'question', 'film', 'is-', 'who', 'human', 'Nobody', 'who', 'seem', 'way', 'end', 'people', 'think', 'are', ""n't"", 'human', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'be', 'different', 'later', 'effects', 'cgi', 'are', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'examination', 'consumed', 'human', 'thing', 'creepy', 'even', 'have', 'cut', 'casing', 'human-', 'sick', 'stuff', 'star', 'movie', 'definately', 'Winstead', 'cast', 'collectively', 'good', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'characters', 'different', 'countries', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'group', 'gathers', 'test', 'see', 'who', 'human', 'where', 'Winstead', 'best', 'Great', 'work', 'here', 'best', 'weapon', 'things', 'FLAMETHROWER', 'Great', 'action', 'movie-', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Theres', 'even', 'time', 'spent', 'craft', 'visitors', 'came', 'Antartica', ""'ll"", 'get', 'feeling', 'isolation', 'fear', ""'82"", 'movie', 'was', 'effective', 'Not', 'mention', 'not', 'everyone', 'speaks', 'English', 'dimension', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'being', 'freezing', 'cold', 'thousands', 'miles', 'civilization', 'not', 'knowing', 'person', 'next', 'human', 'movie', ""n't"", 'end', 'credits', 'Most', 'people', 'theater', 'left', 'time', 'bridging', 'film', 'straight', ""'82"", 'film', 'dog', 'being', 'chased', 'helicopter', 'here', 'dog', 'production', 'notes', 'thought', 'were', 'interesting', 'was', 'million', 'screen', 'captures', ""'82"", 'film', 'lap', 'top', 'was', 'used', 'create', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'Norwegian', 'camp', 'film', 'used', 'practical', 'effects', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'CGI', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Toronto', 'lead', 'character', 'Kate', 'was', 'inspired', 'Weaver', 'character', 'Aliens', 'films', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'wanted', 'make', 'appearance', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'scheduling.4', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

On the big screen and small it was probably the most memorable movie for us during that entire decade...but most of that decade was spent watching very early Van Damme and Segal testosterone oozing films...anything with high body counts and cordite haze.News of the ""prequel"" were heard and the grown son again accompanied me to the screening. The small town Wisconsin theater screwed up the final reel.....so I am literally being forced into purchasing the blu ray/DVD/Ulta-Violet (whatever the hell that is) copy on pre-order....I hope it is as the director wished it to be shown.

They all have good points and bad points.  All three are highly entertaining.Is this third version as good as the other two, no.  Did I see it as a prequel, no.  To me it just seemed like another botched attempt at a very good story.  All three left out the best part of the novella, the human angle, and a really terrific ending.  But, you have to take things as they are, not as you'd wish them to be.  In this case, I wish this movie had taken more time developing characters and not just a high body count that was impossible to count.  I wish they had introduced the discovery of the space ship in a better light; no wow moment there because you can't see what it is.  I wish they hadn't included two endings; one that made no sense and one that served as the only proof they were making a prequel.

There was always a hint of Lovecraftian that I felt on the edges of what issues the film actually focused on: here was a disgusting amalgamation of various creatures, which/whose master plan is unknowable. It is a thing of genius and insanity. It defies us to describe it.Well, they described it pretty well in this, the 'prequel' - a concept that did not sit well with me until I began to see the trailers. Now that I've added this film to my BD collection, the verdict is in (almost; I haven't listened to the commentary tracks just yet. That's tomorrow).The pros:- This prequel is down to the final detail identical to many of the opening sequence of the original- This prequel literally leaves off where the first one begins. You can literally watch them all at one go and there will seem to be no noticeable incongruities. It's a 3-hour film.- The Norwegian cast is great fun to watch together. Americans are the ones that always much things up, eh? Give her a flamethrower and one grenade, and she thinks she's Lara Croft.The Cons:- There are times that the scenes not only remind us of the ""original"", but even the set designs make me feel like they used the same place for both films.- They run a razor's edge on whether or not they showed The Thing too much. It's a coin toss, mostly because the creature designs are that awesome.As for the special features, they step back up to plate and do almost as good a job as for the BD of Carpenter's film. The deleted scenes are more of scene extensions, and while neat to see it was a smart choice to make the cut. The featurette ""Fire and Ice"" literally has the cast and crew running around set and lightning things on fire for the sheer gigglies of it. The main featurette documents the blending of practical and CGI effects and the film maker's dictum to keep as much of it real as possible.Where the original was edge of your seat nail-biting mystery-horror, this new Thing is forced. They forced themselves to adhere to the film classic in all ways. In doing so, it makes the film, in my eyes, not stand out on it's own enough. YMMV, but I'll give them this - it's a hell of a fun ride!>>> EDIT ----- >>> After watching the film again and listening to the commentary, I find I must go back and rate the film at five-stars. The commentary points out both technical goodies as well as Easter eggs scattered sparingly throughout the film. And wouldn't you know it?

John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" was a huge hit so someone(s) looked at it to see if there was another story in there to exploit. The best bet was to take the story with the Norwegians before Carpenter's story begins. I'm in.Here's the scoop. The Norwegians find the space ship stuck in the ice near their base in Antarctica and want to do a study. They enlist a young female biologist to help. The creature thaws out, starts to assimilate people and now it's a game of paranoid survival.This is nearly a carbon copy of Carpenter's piece. It starts with us meeting the crew, them coming into possession of the thing. The thing, of course, escapes and they need to try and figure out who is and who ain't assimilated, along with a way out of the mess. There is a clever turn here on how the assimilated can be detected, but it's mostly what you've already seen. They do a good job in ramping up the paranoia and the turn the goo dial up to 11. The effects are good and the action is smooth.This appears to be a Norwegian production but, as they targeted it for the U.S., they knew they needed some Americans (well....two Americans and an Aussie) to head things up. This is all very clean and slick but it's better craft than art and, given its pedigree, it's not as involving as I would have liked. I do like it and will see it some number of times more.

1506125,A6LG4R7GHVC1P,B00605MY0S,fenx1200,"[0, 1]","From the very beginning this movie suffers from extremely poor character development.  I can still remember all of the characters' names in the original 1982 classic movie by John Carpenter starring Kurt Russell. I could hardly remember anyone's names as soon as the action begins. I think the director was obsessed with getting to the monters as soon as possible, and neglected to bring the antarctic crew together in a cohesive manner. The director may have done this on purpose to possibly show that the scientific, academic types are rather boring.In the original movie (1982), Kurt Russell clearly emerges as the true leader amid the chaos of the alien take-over. Kate Lloyd reluctantly emerges as the leader after discovering the cellular structure of the alien creature and its potential for imitating other life forms.  One thing missing from the original movie (1982) is the fact that Kate Lloyd finds the fillings from people's teeth missing when the alien takes over an organism.  This would hace been great to see in the original movie, and would have made it more interesting.I think this movie had the potential for being a great movie if the proper character development and synergy was colated early on, and if Kate Lloyd's character truly grabbed the role of a definite leader, engaged and as lively as Kurt Russell's original character, MaCready.  Some good old American kick-butt, break-the-rules, action was definitely required here.The creature effects were very good, and I found them to be scary.  The director should have turned up the suspence dial a little more.  I did see some segways into the 1982 classic.  For example, the fire axe embedded into the building wall, the two-headed creature lying in the snow with the hole in the building wall, and the radio operator's suicide.  The helicopter arrival at the end of the movie contained some minor ommissions.  For example, Lars' headset did not have the initials on the metal band (B.H.S.) I think. And the dog did not look like the one in the original movie. I had to watch this movie since I enjoyed the original one and feel it is a horror classic. The Thing (2011) is not as good as the original, but worth your time to watch it, especially if you did not see the original.

1506126,A2897WGLPISHM2,B00605MY0S,Frank Rhee,"[1, 6]","To cut to the chase immediately:  this movie should not have been made. It should have been left alone for another 30 years. At least by the screenwriter and director or whoever thought up this piece of drivel. What an awful, boring, unimaginative movie. The most suspenseful part are the end credits. It was not until I heard the familiar, eerie original 1982 soundtrack that my heart started beating a little faster.  This movie could and should and was supposed to have been so much better. Its brilliant predecessor (John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name) hit the movie theaters 30 years ago. So the makers  have had aeons to dream up and produce a more worthy sequel (or in this case prequel). They utterly failed. It feels rushed, there's not the slightest build-up of tension and suspense and the characters are made of cardboard. The monster is boring too and without any variation. The film is moronic, full of plot holes and illogical. The team of scientists discover what is the greatest find in human history and they treat it like they just discovered a, well , a rusty bike really. They store it in a shed under a tarpaulin and seem to be much more interested in food and drinks. After drilling holes in it they immediately go about their daily business again. These people are scientists, mind you, not engineers or oilworkers. You really don't care who gets absorbed by the monster and who doesn't. They walk out the door as if they are in a holiday camp somewhere in Norway or Sweden. The milder southern parts of these countries, mind you. The cold doesn't seem to bother them nor does their breath fog up.  The snowcats are deliberately sabotaged to prevent the monster from infesting the populated parts of the world, but when the heroine chases the monster, they are easily fixed again and used as chase vehicle. Making  remakes of classic movies is a very dangerous thing. It is not the 1982 John Carpenter original (which was in itself a remake of a 50s movie of the same name), but this 2011 remake which is in dire need of being remade. Preferably soon. To people who love the John Carpenter original and are curious about this prequel --like I was-- I would like to say: don't bother, it's an utter waste of time and if you do watch it, you will feel so disappointed afterwards.

It's just decent, this movie pretty much attempts to explain everything that lead up to the encounter with the Norwegians near the beginning of The Thing by Carpenter. I don't care for the overall casting, no characters are memorable aside from the female lead and the dude that played in Dumb And Dumberer? whatever it's actually called... and he's only memorable because i was annoyed that they cast him until he was killed off then yeah. The CG creatures didn't bother me at all, they were great... the problem I had was basic, the directing... he didn't convey any true sense of hysteria that any normal person or group of people would be exhibiting in this alien encounter situation. The most he gets out of this group of actors is just a type of wide-eyed disbelief and stereotypical fear, let's face it if I was in that situation there would be many moments of outright panic, hysteria that would require yelling and calming others and one's self down, this movie doesn't convey or display any such scenes at all.It's a good film, but lacks the most import ingredient, good directing drawing upon good actors to manifest a true sense of fear, dread and overall hysteria upon facing the gruesome horrific reality of the situation they are trapped within.",3,Decent Prequel To The Thing by Carpenter,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,1347,"['Just', 'watched', 'Blu-ray', 'downloading', 'digital', 'version', 'type', 'quick', 'review', 'just', 'decent', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'attempts', 'explain', 'everything', 'lead', 'up', 'encounter', 'Norwegians', 'beginning', 'Thing', 'Carpenter', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'overall', 'casting', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'aside', 'female', 'lead', 'dude', 'played', 'Dumb', 'Dumberer', 'actually', 'called', 'only', 'memorable', 'i', 'was', 'annoyed', 'cast', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'then', 'yeah', 'CG', 'creatures', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'were', 'great', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'basic', 'directing', 'did', ""n't"", 'convey', 'true', 'sense', 'hysteria', 'normal', 'person', 'group', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'exhibiting', 'alien', 'encounter', 'situation', 'most', 'group', 'actors', 'just', 'type', 'wide-eyed', 'disbelief', 'stereotypical', 'fear', 'let', 'face', 'was', 'situation', 'would', 'be', 'many', 'moments', 'outright', 'panic', 'hysteria', 'would', 'require', 'yelling', 'calming', 'others', 'one', 'down', 'movie', ""n't"", 'convey', 'display', 'such', 'scenes', 'all.It', 'good', 'film', 'most', 'import', 'ingredient', 'good', 'directing', 'drawing', 'upon', 'good', 'actors', 'manifest', 'true', 'sense', 'fear', 'dread', 'overall', 'hysteria', 'facing', 'gruesome', 'horrific', 'reality', 'situation', 'are', 'trapped']",N/A

While the 1982 version had an obvious opening for a prequel, the bar for any attempt was high. Not only would it be hard to tell an equally compelling story, but keeping continuity with and maintaining loyalty to the first narrative would be a huge challenge. The first few scenes hinted at a too-modern &#34;assemble your team&#34; phase, but the cast quickly snuggled in for the more appropriate confinement of the trapped with the beast theme. I was also worried because the first half of the movie feels like a beat-for-beat pretreatment of the events of the Kurt Russell version, but at a pivotal scene the new protagonist comes up with a different solution to the problem of isolating the alien and from then on everything is fresh, exploring more backstory and frightening consequences of the creature's nature. Best of all, I can't think of a single loose thread in continuity. Everything seen in the Norwegian base in 1982 is explained (though occasionally in haste) in this film. The bottom line is that this prequel makes the original seem like a sequel. If only every reboot, remake, and follow up could fit so well, I'd be much happier at the box office!

Very few things.If you called this a ""remake"" instead of a ""prequel"", you wouldn't be wrong.The studios obviously didn't want hardcore fans who loved the original to go into this thinking they would be getting the same ""thing"" (pun intended) over again and not bother with this movie. Instead labeling this movie as a ""prequel"" would be a better marketing move to attract new fans who have never seen the cult classic and thus would not have to fear disappointment for shelling out movie for this movie (if they disliked it).The movie feels  more like a remake than a prequel. The same events that happen in 82 remake happen in 2011 remake.I am not calling this a prequel since there is very little in the way of actual background to the origins of the thing. Where does ""The Thing"" come from? Nope writers never bothered to explain that.What kind of species is it? Nope let's not explain that either. Where does it gain it's power? Nope.I think this hurt the film significantly (since it has bombed in the box office since its opening). It would have been great to get some insight into how exactly the Thing came to earth. It would have shown me some initiative here to differentiate itself from Carpenter classic.Everything that happens in the movie is pretty much lifted or inspired from the Carpenter film.Plot: An alien craft lands in Antarctica (check), the expedition finds the craft and are threatened by the alien who came out of it (check). They slowly become prey for the creature who also begins to imitate the crew until all of them are wiped out (check).Only differences between this and 82 classic is changing the script with the characters and circumstances in which the characters meet their ghastly end.  As you recall in the 82 film the American crew are the victims of the ""Thing"". In this one the Norwegians are the victims of the thing creature.To avoid the obvious comparisons of the 82 movie, director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and writersdecide to introduce a female hero(contrasting with Kurt Russell's MacReady).There is as well definitely a lot more gore in this movie than the 82 movie.The special effects were ok in some areas, and average in others. Some effects didn't even look like they were finished.Don't know what else to add. It's pretty much a coin toss to see this movie.I didn't think it was anything special. I've seen all this before.

The only problem is that it's not the ""original"", it pays homage to it, and so there are many similarities. But if taken on its own, it's as good, except if judged by ""freshness"" or ""originality."" Then it falls when compared to Star Trek's or James Bond's reboots. The way to enjoy this, then, is to forget you saw Carpenter's version. Until the ending credits, that is.But it's actually fun to see them recreate what happened at that smoldering outpost that Kurt Russell's team finds later. Kind of like the other other reboots mentioned, seeing things click into place.You know the plot. Our heroine, Kate, is invited to be on the team for a mysterious discovery by famous, cold-scientist type Sanders. His chilliness is part of the horror, in small ways. The Americans in the team of Norwegians add a note of xenophobia later. The story is the same, with the addition of a fresh, new way to ""out"" the Thing. The ""testing"" scene is full of tension as each person gives off a suitable aura of menace. Most of the characters are likeable, even for the short time you get to know the poor schmucks.The requisite gore is there, although not as icky as reviews led me to expect. Well, your opinion may be different. I suppose it's the type of violence that matters. There are impalements, but no (human) dismemberments, as I recall, so that's ""toned down"" in my book. There are still some disturbing moments, such as the terrible intimacy of one absorption during a long, panicky scene (when the flamethrower chokes, of course - but not before recreating an iconic image from its ""sequel""). There are some surprises and new creatures, although after a while the larger ones look similar due to their toothed, gaping maws.Generally, the shock value is diminished if you've seen JC's version, but they manage to pull off a couple of good scares.The ending wasn't as neat as I'd have liked, and didn't quite tie in as well to the ""series"", but it still provided a clever twist.I liked it.

1506142,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00605MY0S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","It's hard to trump a classic (let alone two classics), and this remake doesn't really do that. And yet 2011's THE THING offers up its own brand of watchability. First, you should know that this isn't a reboot. It's instead a prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 adaptation (which itself is an updating of Howard Hawk's original 1951 version). All three films are inspired by John W. Campbell's novella ""Who goes There?""It's always appreciated when the lead character manages to keep a cool head in trying circumstances, and especially in a survival horror flick. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays paleontologist Kate Lloyd who couldn't pass up an opportunity to take part in an expedition to a remote research outpost in Antarctica, where a gamechanging discovery awaits. And when stranded members of the international team begin to get killed off one by one in horrifying ways, it's Kate Lloyd who keeps it together. She's the one who best applies her analytical skills. Hunted by an otherworldly predator that can replicate human flesh and so pass as one of them, Kate figures out the one other thing - what with the blood test having been sabotaged - that may penetrate the thing's deception. She uses this rule of thumb to unmask the final alien disguise, a feat that addressed one of my beefs (which was why was she not checking this one certain person?). I need to brush up on my powers of observation, because it was obvious once she pointed it out. So I like that the story lays out the ground rules and then adheres to them.I've had friends complain that this newest iteration is too slavish in its homage to John Carpenter's version, that the homage veers too close to mimicry. And maybe it's so. I tend to regard this movie as a companion piece, a complementing prelude. To paraphrase the DVD's audio commentary, the filmmakers had to dabble in a bit of reverse engineering. It addresses the shocking sights witnessed by R.J. MacReady and Dr. Copper as they explored the blasted Norwegian camp early in Carpenter's film. That bloody fire axe on the door. The radio operator with his throat slashed. That block of ice with the hollowed cavity. The burnt carcass of a two-headed freak. We learn how they got to be that way. Those poor doomed Norwegians (played by actual Norwegian actors).A sense of paranoia and distrust permeates the film, naturally. And a sense of melancholy, as well, because, going in, we knew the outcome of this story. I thought the film was good but was undermined by that feel of been there, done that. There isn't enough time given to character development so that when the victims start getting weeded out, there's not enough investment in them, excepting Winstead's competent paleontologist. The f/x crew works with practical effects and CG to flesh out the monster(s) but really does nothing to improve on the 1982 beastie which, back in 1982, was considered a groundbreaking creation. The allure instead lies in watching Mary Elizabeth Winstead breathe life into a sensible Ellen Ripley-type role (and tote a flamethrower) and in that the film allows us to revisit John Carpenter's nightmarish world.3.5 out of 5 stars.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary by director Matthijs van Heijningen and producer Eric Newman- 7 Deleted/Extended Scenes (totaling 00:09:16 minutes)- ""THE THING Evolves"" - the Making Of featurette (00:14:00 minutes)- Fire & Ice - the special effects crew and stunt doubles have fun lighting themselves and other things on fire (00:04:48 minutes)",4,...when too much flossing may get you set on fire...,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,3504,"['hard', 'trump', 'classic', 'let', 'alone', 'two', 'classics', 'remake', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'yet', '2011', 'THE', 'THING', 'up', 'own', 'brand', 'watchability', 'First', 'should', 'know', ""n't"", 'reboot', 'instead', 'prequel', 'John', 'Carpenter', '1982', 'adaptation', 'updating', 'Howard', 'Hawk', 'original', '1951', 'version', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'inspired', 'John', 'W.', 'Campbell', 'novella', 'Who', 'always', 'appreciated', 'when', 'lead', 'character', 'manages', 'keep', 'cool', 'head', 'trying', 'circumstances', 'especially', 'survival', 'horror', 'flick', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'paleontologist', 'Kate', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'opportunity', 'take', 'part', 'expedition', 'remote', 'research', 'outpost', 'Antarctica', 'where', 'gamechanging', 'discovery', 'awaits', 'when', 'stranded', 'members', 'international', 'team', 'begin', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'horrifying', 'ways', 'Kate', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'together', 'one', 'who', 'best', 'analytical', 'skills', 'Hunted', 'otherworldly', 'predator', 'can', 'replicate', 'human', 'flesh', 'so', 'pass', 'one', 'Kate', 'out', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'what', 'blood', 'test', 'having', 'been', 'sabotaged', 'may', 'penetrate', 'thing', 'deception', 'rule', 'thumb', 'unmask', 'final', 'alien', 'disguise', 'feat', 'addressed', 'one', 'beefs', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'checking', 'one', 'certain', 'person', 'need', 'brush', 'up', 'powers', 'observation', 'was', 'obvious', 'once', 'pointed', 'out', 'So', 'like', 'story', 'out', 'ground', 'rules', 'then', 'them.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'friends', 'complain', 'newest', 'iteration', 'too', 'slavish', 'homage', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'homage', 'veers', 'too', 'close', 'mimicry', 'maybe', 'so', 'tend', 'regard', 'movie', 'companion', 'piece', 'complementing', 'prelude', 'paraphrase', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'dabble', 'bit', 'reverse', 'engineering', 'shocking', 'sights', 'witnessed', 'R.J.', 'MacReady', 'Dr.', 'Copper', 'explored', 'blasted', 'Norwegian', 'camp', 'early', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'bloody', 'fire', 'axe', 'door', 'radio', 'operator', 'throat', 'slashed', 'block', 'ice', 'hollowed', 'cavity', 'burnt', 'carcass', 'two-headed', 'freak', 'learn', 'how', 'got', 'be', 'way', 'poor', 'doomed', 'Norwegians', 'played', 'actual', 'Norwegian', 'actors', '.A', 'sense', 'paranoia', 'distrust', 'film', 'naturally', 'sense', 'melancholy', 'as', 'well', 'going', 'knew', 'outcome', 'story', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'undermined', 'feel', 'been', 'there', 'done', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'given', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'when', 'victims', 'start', 'getting', 'weeded', 'out', 'not', 'enough', 'investment', 'excepting', 'Winstead', 'competent', 'paleontologist', 'f/x', 'crew', 'practical', 'effects', 'CG', 'flesh', 'out', 'monster', 's', 'really', 'nothing', 'improve', '1982', 'beastie', 'back', '1982', 'was', 'considered', 'groundbreaking', 'creation', 'allure', 'instead', 'watching', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'breathe', 'life', 'sensible', 'Ellen', 'Ripley-type', 'role', 'tote', 'flamethrower', 'film', 'revisit', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'nightmarish', 'world.3.5', '5', 'stars.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Matthijs', 'van', 'Heijningen', 'producer', 'Eric', 'Newman-', '7', 'Deleted/Extended', 'Scenes', 'totaling', '00:09:16', 'minutes', 'THING', 'Evolves', 'Making', 'featurette', '00:14:00', 'minutes', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'special', 'effects', 'crew', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'have', 'fun', 'lighting', 'other', 'things', 'fire', '00:04:48', 'minutes']",N/A

1506145,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B00605MY0S,Ian,"[3, 5]","When it comes to remakes, sequels, or prequels, doing anything involving classic films is a very risky business, even more so when dealing with one of the most beloved films of horror cinema.  Any filmmaker involved in the process can only do their best, and hope that fans won't tear them apart upon releasing a companion piece to their treasured masterpiece.  The best they can probably hope for is to at least make an entertaining movie that can at least compliment what has come before, and in that aspect, ""The Thing"" manages to succeed.Taking place three days before the beginning of John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name, ""The Thing,"" follows a group of Norwegian explorers and scientists in Antarctica, who have found a spaceship buried under the ice, as well as what appears to be an alien life-form.  But their joy and excitement quickly turn to fear when the alien escapes, and is revealed not only to be incredibly bloodthirsty, but also capable of copying and mimicking any life-form it comes across...including people.From the very beginning, ""The Thing"" has the unenviable task of standing in Carpenter's shadow, and despite it's best efforts, it comes off as something imitating the original while trying to be it's own thing: with a breakneck pace (thus having very little time for character development), heavier emphasis on deaths and gruesome body transformations, ""The Thing"" feels like an action film, rather then a horror film, and isn't particularly scary.  The fact that it relies very heavily on obvious CGI to bring it's monster to life, rather then practical effects, also hurts as well, because after seeing the astonishing puppet and make-up effects in the original, having pixels running about on the screen doesn't have the same impact.Yet, despite the differences in tone, the use of CGI over practical effects, and the lack of scares, amazingly, ""The Thing"" really isn't that bad.  It's fast pace means there's no time to be bored with what's going on, the action is constant and interesting to watch, and even though almost all of it is CGI, the sheer amount of body parts, teeth, claws, and tentacles waving about on screen is compelling enough to follow, and the ending, while having some continuity problems in terms of character appearances, does tie into the original very well.Overall, ""The Thing"" has the unique distinction of being an unnecessary addition to the ""Thing"" franchise, yet is entertaining in it's own right.  Unlike other series where some installments can cheapen or spoil an entire franchise, ""The Thing"" is a brisk entry that, while not as grand as the original, is still a fun watch.",3,"Unnecessary, but still fun",1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,2649,"['When', 'remakes', 'sequels', 'prequels', 'doing', 'anything', 'involving', 'classic', 'films', 'very', 'risky', 'business', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'dealing', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'films', 'horror', 'cinema', 'filmmaker', 'involved', 'process', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'best', 'hope', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tear', 'apart', 'releasing', 'companion', 'piece', 'treasured', 'masterpiece', 'best', 'can', 'probably', 'hope', 'least', 'make', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'can', 'least', 'compliment', 'what', 'come', 'aspect', 'Thing', 'succeed.Taking', 'place', 'three', 'days', 'beginning', 'John', 'Carpenter', '1982', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Thing', 'group', 'Norwegian', 'explorers', 'scientists', 'Antarctica', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'spaceship', 'buried', 'ice', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'be', 'alien', 'life-form', 'joy', 'excitement', 'quickly', 'turn', 'fear', 'when', 'alien', 'escapes', 'revealed', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'incredibly', 'bloodthirsty', 'also', 'capable', 'copying', 'mimicking', 'life-form', 'including', 'very', 'beginning', 'Thing', 'unenviable', 'task', 'standing', 'Carpenter', 'shadow', 'best', 'efforts', 'off', 'something', 'imitating', 'original', 'trying', 'be', 'own', 'thing', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'thus', 'having', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'heavier', 'emphasis', 'deaths', 'gruesome', 'body', 'transformations', 'Thing', 'feels', 'action', 'film', 'rather', 'then', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'scary', 'fact', 'very', 'heavily', 'obvious', 'CGI', 'bring', 'monster', 'life', 'rather', 'then', 'practical', 'effects', 'also', 'as', 'well', 'seeing', 'astonishing', 'puppet', 'make-up', 'effects', 'original', 'having', 'pixels', 'running', 'about', 'screen', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'impact.Yet', 'differences', 'tone', 'use', 'CGI', 'practical', 'effects', 'lack', 'scares', 'amazingly', 'Thing', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'fast', 'pace', 'time', 'be', 'bored', 'what', 'going', 'action', 'constant', 'interesting', 'watch', 'even', 'almost', 'CGI', 'sheer', 'amount', 'body', 'parts', 'teeth', 'claws', 'tentacles', 'waving', 'screen', 'compelling', 'enough', 'follow', 'ending', 'having', 'continuity', 'problems', 'terms', 'character', 'appearances', 'tie', 'original', 'very', 'well.Overall', 'Thing', 'unique', 'distinction', 'being', 'unnecessary', 'addition', 'Thing', 'franchise', 'entertaining', 'own', 'right', 'other', 'series', 'where', 'installments', 'can', 'cheapen', 'spoil', 'entire', 'franchise', 'Thing', 'brisk', 'entry', 'not', 'as', 'grand', 'original', 'still', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A
1506146,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B00605MY0S,I'm Right,"[0, 0]","*Warning* This review is spoiler-tasticIf you completely ignore the existance of John Carpenter's The Thing than this movie would probably be seen in a better light, but alas it's in the shadow of it's 80's predecessar. Since around 2004 a few writers considered another film to add to the Thing's series, ultimately settling on a prequel. They took a long time to write the script, and gave it to the Strike company who produced Dawn of the Dead, so things (LOL PUN!) looked pretty bright huh? Then the director said while there was a woman as the star, there would be no ham-fisted love story and the effects will be practical, and the cast will be largely Norwegian, staying true to the original. Wow! Hopes were high for this, well lets take all of these promising features and apply them to the finished product.-Prequel: it made sense to make it a prequel, there was some room for a sequel to the Thing but it could've gone horribly wrong since everyone in the original is presumed dead. Could've been really really stupid so they played it safe, and although the end is predictable the journey there can be entertaining.-Strike Company: this is where the problems come in, while the prequel seemed like it was getting loving care and detail to polish it up Strike decided to rush the production, meaning all the effects turned into CGI, which was lazy and stupid. The story itself is also rushed, aside from Kate, the white American pilot and the jerk boss Sanders we don't know anything about any of the other characters, and they're all hard to distinguish from each other which is a real shame because they all look like good actors.-Norwegians: The original script called for an all Norwegian cast, as it was a Norwegian camp, makes sense right? But the production company wanted more 'MURICANS so the stupid xenophobic audience can relate, so the half of the cast that matters are Americans, while all the Norwegians are treated like death fodder, being largely inconsequential to the plot. Oh and the one single Norwegian that doesn't know English happens to be the one that confronts the Americans in Carpenter's version. Veeeeery coincedential.-Starring a Female!: Sigorney Weaver has shown that a woman can kick ass in these kinds of films, but there shouldn't be some corny Grrl Power message thrown in. There was in here. Throughout the film you see that Sanders and Kate have a slowly building rivalry, and at some point in the film he talks with the other Norwegian superior literally saying ""looks like the woman is in charge now"". Do we really need this in sci-fi horror movie the Thing? We're not watching Sex & the City here, and of course at the end Kate has a dumb showdown with the monster who happens to have Sander's face still intact, in case the dumb audience couldn't put it together that this guy is mean to women and should die, even though, he already did... stupid decision.Weird Unnecessary Set Up Scenes: So apparently there was a dog in the camp somewhere, you see like one second where it's trying to bite open the cage. Ok? It's just out of the camera until the very end, who knows what it was doing the whole time, who got to it, why they wanted the dog, whatever. It pops up at the end anyways which brings me to another scene. Kate and the one Norwegian that doesn't speak English (Lars) go to a grenade cache in a fairly suspenseful scene, but then he just opens it up and stares at her and grunts ""granada"". If I were Kate I would be like ""Ok. What about the grenades? Any plan with them? Are you going to start chucking grenades at whoever turns into the next thing in these tight confined rooms? Couldn't grenades destroy most of the building, messing up the whole warm shelter situation we have going for us? Why grenades? Aren't flamethrowers doing the job already? What? Who? Why?"" Grenades serve no practical purpose for them until the very ending, he just shows it to her and might as well wink at the audience, saying ""we know this a prequel, see?"".-The Trailer: The trailer gave away everyone who was the Thing in one way or another, and even if you didn't see the trailer the film itself makes it painfully clear who's the Thing. One of the great things about the original is that whenever someone turned out to be the Thing it was completely unexpected, they were completely off the list of red herrings and the film doesn't exactly show when they were assimilated. In the prequel however one guy leaves the group when the Thing escapes, guess what happened to him? Later we see that guy just stare at someone as THEY leave the group, guess what happens to that person! Edvard genuinely suprised me though, but that brings me to my next point.-The Thing itself: despite it being crappy CGI effects the Thing itself acted stupidly, I guess you could say it was getting used to people so it was more prone to mistakes, but that sounds like a sloppy excuse considering this Thing likely wiped out planets in order to get all those grotesque shapes. In this prequel however when the Thing attacks people it's very loud and makes a huge commotion, like when the French chick turned into the Thing it started throwing bookcases over and roaring really loudly, also breaking the door open to chase Kate down a hallway. Can you imagine if it happened to catch her and assimilate her, both of them later explaining that to the others? ""Uhh we were kind of play fighting and one of us hit the door so hard it broke off, yeah that's it, keep looking at that broken door with your back turned as we roar into giant things and make even more commotion"". Also the Thing in Carpenter's wasn't a good brawler, it's strength was stealth, it attacked one person at a time and when it was confronted by multiple people it wasn't very effective, it tried hiding and running away. In this new one when Edvard changes he kills like 6 people under a minute, the worst addition being that lame spear tentacle that stabs a few people. Wow, really interesting death scene, *yawn* oh is it over already?Third act: After the camp is decimated and the two attractive American's are chasing the evil sexist foreigner the film reaches what could be the dumbest scene of all time, the space ship scene. Basically it's an excuse for Kate to get stuck in narrow spaces and for loud CGI jump scares, until we get to the famous gender showdown at the end, where she blows it up similar to the ending to Carpenter's the Thing. Here's an alternate idea for that whole third act, the spaceship crashed, the alien LEFT the spaceship so it's obviously NOT working, instead of going back it makes a break for another camp and the tractor runs out of gas so it starts going on foot. The American's catch up but are low on flamethrower gas, so they have to sacrifice the gas to get them back in order to destroy the Thing once and for all. This would lead to an ambigious ending, instead of Kate going to some Russian camp after burning the stupidest Thing ever that didn't kill her when it had the chance.But it had some good aspects too, the cinematography was beautiful, and I thought the cold climate was shown effectively. The Thing designs were still grisly and memorable, also some of the deaths were pretty nasty (like the hand-thing glued to that guys face, F THAT). Despite the predictability of who was who there was still some tension in the 2nd act between all of the characters, and they played off each other really well. And of course the ending was a perfect bridge between Carpenter's version and the prequel. Overall I found it disappointing though because it was obviously rushed out and dumbed down for mass appeal.When the Thing came out in the 80's someone summed up it's production process perfectly, saying ""it was a movie that could only come out in the 80's"", meaning the studios were more lax about what was going on, the deadlines weren't rushed, they had time to make some really good practical effects, and so on and so forth. It was a product of it's time, similar to the first couple of Star Wars, the prequel to the Thing however is also a product of the current time, the Thing's now owned by Universal and they made it as appealing as they could, sacrificing geniune surpises, fleshed out characters, and a really solid script for a quick appealing film. If Carpenter's film released in 2011 it would probably be like this, CGI fest with a rushed script. I would however recommend this to anyone interested, especially if they haven't seen the 80's version. It's still a pretty interesting story, but if you've seen the Carpenter version and how tight that script was this one comes off as weak and disappointing.",2,The Stupid Thing,1329091200,"02 13,

They are using an underground scanner. Their is a strong reading. Suddenly the snow-covered ground beneath them give way under the snow vehicle and send them down a crevice. The vehicle gets stuck between the walls.Another team arrives at a base. They take Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Adam (Eric Christian Olsen) to an underground site. Their they meet Edvard (Trond Espen Seim), Karl (Carsten Bjornlund) and Juliette (Kim Bubbs). They show them where a UFO was discovered.  Then Kate and Adam are taken to the hole the other team had fallen through. Under the ice surface, they see a creature frozen in the ice. They believe came from the UFO.Thy take the creature, encased in a block of ice, back to the base. The doctor uses a drill into the ice to get a sample of tissue from the creature.Later,  Derek (Adewale Akinnuoye-Aghaje) goes into the room alone to look at the block of ice. As the ice is melting, he is getting a better view of the creature. The creature is huge.  Suddenly, the creature blasts through the ice and goes through the ceiling.Now outside, the creature is hiding. It is hungry. it has killed a dog and now it is after fresh human meat.This Thing is going to stay around until it gets every human to munch on.

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[0, 1]","The Thing is not a remake, but a prequel to John Carpenter's cult classic of the same name, where an alien being crash-lands on Earth after a supposed malfunction in its ship. The year is 1982, and a Norwegian team stationed in Antarctica have just uncovered the ship, and the frozen occupant. Recruiting the help of paleontologist Kate Lloyd, the financier of the discovery Dr. Sander Halvorson and his assistant Adam Finch then escort her to the dig site. But after they recover the creature and celebrate, things take a turn for the worst when the being awakens after thawing out, and begins killing the crew one by one. But the Thing doesn't just kill them, it assimilates them, becoming them. So, how do you fight something you can't see?Directed by Dutch filmmaker Matthijs van Heijningen, Jr., The Thing is a surprisingly well-made prequel that does the original justice, but not in the best way possible. If this prequel wanted to really define the greatness behind The Thing, it would have been longer, taken different twists and turns, but ultimately end at the same conclusion. Instead, it plays out a lot like the original film. When I mean a lot, I mean some of the scenes play out almost exactly like they did in the original, like when the Thing attacks the group after they try to help one of their own, revealing itself to be the injured party. Now while this isn't bad, it still would have been better if they did something more original. The acting was superb all-around, especially the slight show-stealing Lars, played by Jorgen Langhelle. The visual effects were overall good, having some truly award-worthy effects, and some run-of-the-mill effects that were alright, but kept the effects from ranking along side films with some other great CG the same year (Cowboys & Aliens, Real Steel, and Super 8). Though the scene that deserved an award just for the awe-inspiring feeling it produced was the shots of the alien craft starting-up. The effects were and still are some of the best, which is kind of surprising for a $35 million movie. The script was good, nothing award-worthy but living up to the original, and Marco Beltrami's score was just great. Keeping the same theme (which appears in the end credits) from the original, Beltrami creates a haunting and eerie sound-scape that is very memorable and spine-tingling.Honestly, I really don't get why this movie bombed at the box office. Was it because of the theatrical trailer? Did people actually listen to the critics when the movie came out? If so, that's sad. If you have seen the original or like science fiction/thrillers, get this. I'm not sure that there are many movies that can or have had a prequel treatment that's as good as this.4/5 Stars****",4,A Note-worthy Prequel That Might Be Too Much of the Original,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,2736,"['Thing', 'not', 'remake', 'prequel', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'cult', 'classic', 'same', 'name', 'where', 'alien', 'being', 'crash-lands', 'Earth', 'supposed', 'malfunction', 'ship', 'year', '1982', 'Norwegian', 'team', 'stationed', 'Antarctica', 'have', 'just', 'uncovered', 'ship', 'frozen', 'occupant', 'Recruiting', 'help', 'paleontologist', 'Kate', 'Lloyd', 'financier', 'discovery', 'Dr.', 'Sander', 'Halvorson', 'assistant', 'Adam', 'Finch', 'then', 'escort', 'dig', 'site', 'recover', 'creature', 'celebrate', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worst', 'when', 'being', 'awakens', 'thawing', 'out', 'killing', 'crew', 'one', 'one', 'Thing', ""n't"", 'just', 'kill', 'becoming', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'fight', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Directed', 'Dutch', 'filmmaker', 'Matthijs', 'van', 'Heijningen', 'Jr.', 'Thing', 'surprisingly', 'well-made', 'prequel', 'original', 'justice', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'prequel', 'wanted', 'really', 'define', 'greatness', 'Thing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'taken', 'different', 'twists', 'turns', 'ultimately', 'end', 'same', 'conclusion', 'Instead', 'out', 'lot', 'original', 'film', 'When', 'mean', 'lot', 'mean', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'almost', 'exactly', 'did', 'original', 'when', 'Thing', 'group', 'try', 'help', 'one', 'own', 'revealing', 'be', 'injured', 'party', 'Now', ""n't"", 'bad', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'did', 'something', 'more', 'original', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'all-around', 'especially', 'slight', 'show-stealing', 'Lars', 'played', 'Jorgen', 'Langhelle', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'overall', 'good', 'having', 'truly', 'award-worthy', 'effects', 'run-of-the-mill', 'effects', 'were', 'alright', 'kept', 'effects', 'ranking', 'along', 'side', 'films', 'other', 'great', 'CG', 'same', 'year', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'Real', 'Steel', 'Super', '8', 'scene', 'deserved', 'award', 'just', 'awe-inspiring', 'feeling', 'produced', 'was', 'shots', 'alien', 'craft', 'starting-up', 'effects', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'best', 'kind', 'surprising', '35', 'million', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'good', 'nothing', 'award-worthy', 'living', 'up', 'original', 'Marco', 'Beltrami', 'score', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'Keeping', 'same', 'theme', 'end', 'credits', 'original', 'Beltrami', 'haunting', 'eerie', 'sound-scape', 'very', 'memorable', 'spine-tingling.Honestly', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'movie', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'Was', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Did', 'people', 'actually', 'listen', 'critics', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'so', 'sad', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'like', 'science', 'fiction/thrillers', 'get', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'have', 'had', 'prequel', 'treatment', 'as', 'good', 'this.4/5', 'Stars****']",N/A

I remember watching it on LaserDisc (wasn't all that popular in comparison to DVDs, but I still enjoyed it) as a young kid and loving it, not really get horrified, but enjoying the fright chill (and chill overall).Now we have what happened before all that, starting with a Norwegian crew in the Arctic tracking the source of a signal that, given time, unleashes a chameleon-like chaos. Now's a good time to be rather paranoid.I almost couldn't recognize Mary Winstead from when I saw her in Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World (the main movie I can always remember her in) since she has a much more serious role in this and is a stronger, more independent heroine (I guess that's because there's no love interest here for her) as well as a group of guys that I've never seen before, all having an interesting flavor to add to this frightful recipe. I thought the special effects in the original Thing were crazy good for its time, this time, they get a believable revamp. Nothing like completely obvious CGI, but it looks real enough (and disturbing enough) to almost get you paranoid in life (almost), facial shifts, skeletal breaks, body rearrangements, complete metamorpheses that get under your skin (and practially stay there), and a good dash of common sense to help with the paranoid tension between everyone.This was definitely one very good prequel in an age of Hollywood where most prequels end up falling flat and are better to not notice at all. And then, the last test done for the last enemy was one that did end up getting me good, despite its simplicity.Those, along with the visual effects of contrasting infernoes and surrounding ice (some of it in a couple characters' personalities), this will be one very good horror movie to be rememebered for a time to come.",4,Prelude to chaos,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,1842,"['really', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'first', 'watched', 'Thing', 'kid', 'remember', 'watching', 'LaserDisc', 'was', ""n't"", 'popular', 'comparison', 'DVDs', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'young', 'kid', 'loving', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'horrified', 'enjoying', 'fright', 'chill', 'chill', 'overall', '.Now', 'have', 'what', 'happened', 'starting', 'Norwegian', 'crew', 'Arctic', 'tracking', 'source', 'signal', 'given', 'time', 'chameleon-like', 'chaos', 'Now', 'good', 'time', 'be', 'rather', 'paranoid.I', 'almost', 'could', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Mary', 'Winstead', 'when', 'saw', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Vs.', 'World', 'main', 'movie', 'can', 'always', 'remember', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'stronger', 'more', 'independent', 'heroine', 'guess', 'love', 'interest', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'group', 'guys', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'having', 'interesting', 'flavor', 'add', 'frightful', 'recipe', 'thought', 'special', 'effects', 'original', 'Thing', 'were', 'crazy', 'good', 'time', 'time', 'get', 'believable', 'revamp', 'Nothing', 'completely', 'obvious', 'CGI', 'real', 'enough', 'disturbing', 'enough', 'almost', 'get', 'paranoid', 'life', 'almost', 'facial', 'shifts', 'skeletal', 'breaks', 'body', 'rearrangements', 'complete', 'metamorpheses', 'get', 'skin', 'practially', 'stay', 'there', 'good', 'dash', 'common', 'sense', 'help', 'paranoid', 'tension', 'everyone.This', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'prequel', 'age', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'most', 'prequels', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'flat', 'are', 'better', 'not', 'notice', 'then', 'last', 'test', 'done', 'last', 'enemy', 'was', 'one', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'good', 'simplicity.Those', 'visual', 'effects', 'contrasting', 'infernoes', 'surrounding', 'ice', 'couple', 'characters', 'personalities', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'be', 'rememebered', 'time', 'come']",N/A
1506157,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00605MY0S,Jason,"[6, 11]","This is how remakes are supposed to be done!  It sticks VERY closely to the original, adds substantial input without straying too far outside the original concept's box, refreshes the FX and filming for a modern audience, and throws in a final loop to make it all worthwhile.  Technically, the film is not a remake; it's a prequel, but there is enough content that nearly the entire film feels like an homage.  Very pleasing to someone wanting things to be similar to the original.  And keeping the title the same adds some John Carpenter shape-shifting mystique to the entire film.  Bravo!For those unaware of the original, the plot is simple but insidious: An alien life-form has been found in the remote wintery wilderness of an Antarctica research site cut off from the rest of the world.  The human inhabitants must kill the alien before it reaches the rest of humanity.  The problem, the creature thrives in extreme colds, and can mimic any lifeform's appearance to perfection.It's clear going in that none of the stars of the show have any chance of exuding the gravitas a cast of Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Keith David, and Donald Moffat, the 2011 version does a very fine, professional job of conveying the fear and paranoia of their situation.  I particularly enjoyed Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's performance.  Where the cast lacks, however, is their inability to carry, in relation to the original, the intensity.  Making up for that minor void is a substantial upgrade in action (read: more flamethrowers).  John Carpenter's version: Suspense.  2011 version: Action/Suspense.Where this film scores the most is the story.  A plausible connection to the first film justifies the ample screen time the Thing receives, as well as some truly gruesome assimilations with the unfortunate cast-members.  The assimilations are explained with a bit of pseudo-science, but the exponential cell-to-cell siege is certainly an upgrade to the John Carpenter's version.  As with the first film's ""blood test"" reveal, the screen-writers for this film were able to insert an equally ingenious method of determining just which people were actually human.

It's not perfect, i first thought they had too many unknown actors in the lead roles, but over time, they all grew on me. The Thing creature could of been more gory, but for the scenes it was in, it was pretty cool. The Ending in my own mind, is the most perfect ending to a prequel ever. It just flows into the 82 classic flawlessly, when you see the Norweigian Base Camp frozen at the end, and the dead scientists inside, it hit the mark right on cue. I am actually glad they made a prequel instead of a remake of the 82 classic, because they wouldn't have done it justice. 4/5 stars for me.",4,"Not Enough Showing Of ""The Thing"" Creature, But The Best Ending To A Prequel",1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,823,"['know', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'worthy', 'prequel', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'almighty', '1982', 'classic', 'Thing', 'i', 'think', 'mark', 'when', 'want', 'feeling', 'watching', 'original', '82', 'classic', 'over', 'again', 'not', 'perfect', 'i', 'first', 'thought', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'unknown', 'actors', 'lead', 'roles', 'time', 'grew', 'Thing', 'creature', 'could', 'been', 'more', 'gory', 'scenes', 'was', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Ending', 'own', 'mind', 'most', 'perfect', 'ending', 'prequel', 'ever', 'just', '82', 'classic', 'flawlessly', 'when', 'see', 'Norweigian', 'Base', 'Camp', 'frozen', 'end', 'dead', 'scientists', 'hit', 'mark', 'right', 'cue', 'am', 'actually', 'glad', 'made', 'prequel', 'instead', 'remake', '82', 'classic', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'justice', '4/5', 'stars']",N/A
1506159,A20CR4907G7CTS,B00605MY0S,Jeff Marzano,"[2, 3]","This isn't a bad movie overall I would say.  The expectations were high because of the two previous movies that are very highly regarded.I wouldn't say the plot and writing is the strong point for this movie.  The scientist who leads the investigation, Dr. Sander, is a cold fish who makes the transition from a stuffed shirt academic to a mad scientist too quickly.  He was crazy even before he became the Thing.  In fact it seems like everyone in this movie already saw part 2.The movie's greatest strengths would be the special effects for the creature and the scenery in general.  It also fills in some of the missing pieces about what happened before John Carpenter's version since this is actually a prequel for Carpenter's 1982 movie.Carpenter's version was not a sequel to the original but a retelling of the story to match the book 'Who Goes There ?'.  Carpenter's version is a classic but it introduced a lot of subtle and rather vague issues about the true nature of the creature which were not present with the original black and white movie from 1951.It's never totally clear to what extent someone is aware that they have been invaded by the Thing.  In some cases the person doesn't seem to realize it themselves until their head explodes while in other cases the person seems to be following the Thing's will at all times.  This implies that when the Thing replicates someone it can also replicate their memories.  This makes the creature basically impossible to identify for other people.In both movies confusing things happen which are really never totally explained.The Thing that John Carpenter created could never be allowed to get loose in society.  As Dr. Blair figured out in part 2 it would take approximately 27,000 hours or 3 years for the creature to take over the entire human population.  Carpenter's creature is sort of a hybrid between a demon and a virus.That factor creates a lot of restrictions for making a movie about this monster.  The group always has to be isolated from the rest of the world.  All three movies include a loss of communications with the outside world although in this installment the main scientist arrives from outside already knowing about the flying saucer.  To me this would imply that others outside of Antarctica may also have known.  That was a possible angle that wasn't followed up in this movie though.The ending of this movie doesn't make any sense to me if we assume that when two people are possessed by the Thing they would both be aware of this.There were three people involved with the final battle.  One was definitely a Thing.  But the Thing status of the other two was not clear to me.  The ending seems to imply that at least one of those two others was a Thing.  In that case why didn't one of them assist the other Thing to kill the normal person ?Either that or the lovely but lethal flame thrower wielding scientist made one heck of a mistake.  Maybe she got too trigger happy with the flame thrower I don't know.  She's another mystery in the movie since Carpenter's version doesn't say anything about her.  I guess we'll have to wait until part 4 to find out about her but at the current production rate for sequels that will probably be in 2041.Anyway something isn't adding up here for me.I hope the trend of showing parts of movies after the credits have started at the end stops soon.  Someone told me I missed an important part of the Green Lantern because I must have left the theater when the credits started.  I was probably out in the parking lot by the time they showed the part I missed.  Now I don't know what the Hell is going on.I have an idea.  What about producing a true sequel to the original 1951 version ?  Doing this would create a separate movie series from this one since the two creatures are completely different.Although I doubt that many movie producers would dare to attempt this unless they have a solid concept.  They would be messing around with a Hollywood legend.PhantasmThe Blob (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (Color Special Edition)Horror Hotel (City of the Dead)The Four Skulls of Jonathan DrakeThe MansterThe Flesh EatersBeyond the Darkness: Buio Omega (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla / Godzilla vs. DestoroyahAlien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction",4,Ending Didn't Make Sense To Me,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,4312,"[""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'overall', 'would', 'say', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'two', 'previous', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'highly', 'regarded.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'plot', 'writing', 'strong', 'point', 'movie', 'scientist', 'who', 'investigation', 'Dr.', 'Sander', 'cold', 'fish', 'who', 'transition', 'stuffed', 'shirt', 'academic', 'mad', 'scientist', 'too', 'quickly', 'was', 'crazy', 'even', 'became', 'Thing', 'fact', 'everyone', 'movie', 'already', 'saw', 'part', '2.The', 'movie', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'would', 'be', 'special', 'effects', 'creature', 'scenery', 'general', 'also', 'missing', 'pieces', 'what', 'happened', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'actually', 'prequel', 'Carpenter', '1982', 'movie.Carpenter', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'sequel', 'original', 'retelling', 'story', 'match', 'book', 'Goes', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'classic', 'introduced', 'lot', 'subtle', 'rather', 'vague', 'issues', 'true', 'nature', 'creature', 'were', 'not', 'present', 'original', 'black', 'white', 'movie', '1951.It', 'never', 'totally', 'clear', 'what', 'extent', 'someone', 'aware', 'have', 'been', 'invaded', 'Thing', 'cases', 'person', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'head', 'explodes', 'other', 'cases', 'person', 'be', 'following', 'Thing', 'will', 'times', 'when', 'Thing', 'someone', 'can', 'also', 'replicate', 'memories', 'creature', 'basically', 'impossible', 'identify', 'other', 'people.In', 'movies', 'confusing', 'things', 'happen', 'are', 'really', 'never', 'totally', 'explained.The', 'Thing', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'created', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'get', 'loose', 'society', 'Dr.', 'Blair', 'figured', 'out', 'part', '2', 'would', 'take', 'approximately', '27,000', 'hours', '3', 'years', 'creature', 'take', 'over', 'entire', 'human', 'population', 'Carpenter', 'creature', 'sort', 'hybrid', 'demon', 'virus.That', 'factor', 'lot', 'restrictions', 'making', 'movie', 'monster', 'group', 'always', 'be', 'isolated', 'rest', 'world', 'three', 'movies', 'include', 'loss', 'communications', 'outside', 'world', 'installment', 'main', 'scientist', 'arrives', 'outside', 'already', 'knowing', 'flying', 'saucer', 'would', 'imply', 'others', 'Antarctica', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'possible', 'angle', 'was', ""n't"", 'followed', 'up', 'movie', 'ending', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'assume', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'possessed', 'Thing', 'would', 'be', 'aware', 'were', 'three', 'people', 'involved', 'final', 'battle', 'One', 'was', 'definitely', 'Thing', 'Thing', 'status', 'other', 'two', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'ending', 'imply', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'others', 'was', 'Thing', 'case', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'assist', 'other', 'Thing', 'kill', 'normal', 'person', 'lovely', 'lethal', 'flame', 'thrower', 'wielding', 'scientist', 'made', 'one', 'heck', 'mistake', 'Maybe', 'got', 'too', 'trigger', 'happy', 'flame', 'thrower', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'mystery', 'movie', 'Carpenter', 'version', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'part', '4', 'find', 'out', 'current', 'production', 'rate', 'sequels', 'will', 'probably', 'be', '2041.Anyway', 'something', ""n't"", 'adding', 'up', 'here', 'me.I', 'hope', 'trend', 'showing', 'parts', 'movies', 'credits', 'have', 'started', 'end', 'soon', 'Someone', 'told', 'missed', 'important', 'part', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'must', 'have', 'left', 'theater', 'when', 'credits', 'started', 'was', 'probably', 'out', 'parking', 'lot', 'time', 'showed', 'part', 'missed', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Hell', 'going', 'on.I', 'have', 'idea', 'What', 'producing', 'true', 'sequel', 'original', '1951', 'version', 'Doing', 'would', 'create', 'separate', 'movie', 'series', 'one', 'two', 'creatures', 'are', 'completely', 'doubt', 'many', 'movie', 'producers', 'would', 'dare', 'attempt', 'have', 'solid', 'concept', 'would', 'be', 'messing', 'Hollywood', 'legend.PhantasmThe', 'Blob', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Earth', 'Flying', 'Saucers', 'Color', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Horror', 'Hotel', 'City', 'Dead', 'Four', 'Skulls', 'Jonathan', 'DrakeThe', 'MansterThe', 'Flesh', 'EatersBeyond', 'Darkness', 'Buio', 'Omega', 'Two-Disc', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'Godzilla', 'vs.', 'SpaceGodzilla', '/', 'Godzilla', 'vs.', 'DestoroyahAlien', 'Autopsy', 'Fact', 'Fiction']",N/A

She is shocked to find out that the Norwegians have found an extraterrestrial spacecraft and about 300 yards away is an alien body frozen in the glacier's ice.

Anyone whose seen John Carpenters amazing version of ""The Thing"" will see this immediately. What the filmmakers did wrong was simply call the movie ""The Thing"". That is where 99% of the confusion lies. They really should have called it ""The Thing From Outer Space"" or something like that to help differentiate it.That being said, I think the film is a very well done prequel (George Lucas could definitely take some notes on this), although the story is flawed and the continuity between this film and the 1982 source material is not always 100% correct, it is  still a fun exploration of the events that unfolded at the Norwegian camp prior to the Husky escaping and making its way to the U.S Research Post NOR 31 in Carpenter's film. The film begins with the discovery of the creature buried in the ice by a Norwegian research camp and the hush-hush recruitment of several American scientists to research the find. The creature thaws and escapes the block of ice. What is next is a series of events similar to the original film with crew members one by one being assimilated by the Thing, leading up to a climatic showdown at the buried alien spacecraft that crash landed in the ice several thousands of years earlier. The end of the film is excellent as it blends in PERFECTLY with the opening of the 1982 film, essentially allowing you to watch both films back to back almost seamlessly.All pleasantries aside however, the story is not incredible, and the CGI effects are ghastly to put it mildly (it makes you TRULY appreciate the work that Rob Bottin, and Stan Winston to a much lesser extent, did in 1981-1982). What the movie DOES do, however, is explain some of the mysteries seen at the smoldering remnants of the Norwegian camp as found in Carpenters film (the fire axe in the door, the hole in the wall, the straight razor guy, the burned up two-faced Thing, just to name a few), and although this film is not a tenth the film ""The Thing"" (1982) is, it is a worthwhile watch for fans, if only to help fill in the gaps.",4,A PREQUEL!!!

1506171,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B00605MY0S,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[1, 3]","As a pre-quel to the 1958 and 1982 films ""The Thing"" has a bunch of people in a remote lab in Antartica where a paleontologist named Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"") along with said group find some incredible discovery that is of course something that can change the fate of the world. This discovery turns out to be an alien being that has been encased in ice for years upon years and once its thawed it begins to turn everyone against one another as this being can mimic anyone it touches so who can you really trust?If you've seen the previous films you know what to expect here, the usual build-up with the eventual creature attacks and the face/off between the remaining characters as they fight to survive. The initial scenes with the exploration and discovery are decent, once the creature comes to life (which doesn't take long mind you) it becomes a typical horror flick. Its kind of a goofy looking monster but isn't nearly as bad as many other sci-fi/horror movie monsters have been.Personally this is one remake/pre-quel they could've done without, it really doesn't tell much more that we didn't already know. Sure there's a little tension, a few jolts and the acting is ok for this type of flick, Mary does shine as she's one of the breakout stars in Hollywood in my opinion. It doesn't involve much thought as its fairly straight foward and to the point. As stated in other reviews, the last few scenes do tie into the beginning of the 1982 film which I guess was a decent touch. However its really kinda boring as most of the characters are throw away and one dimensional. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",2,"Some ""thing"" is coming for everyone....",1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,1637,"['pre-quel', '1958', '1982', 'films', 'Thing', 'bunch', 'people', 'remote', 'lab', 'Antartica', 'where', 'paleontologist', 'named', 'Kate', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Vs', 'World', 'said', 'group', 'find', 'incredible', 'discovery', 'course', 'something', 'can', 'change', 'fate', 'world', 'discovery', 'out', 'be', 'alien', 'being', 'been', 'encased', 'ice', 'years', 'years', 'once', 'thawed', 'turn', 'everyone', 'one', 'being', 'can', 'mimic', 'anyone', 'so', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'trust', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previous', 'films', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'here', 'usual', 'build-up', 'eventual', 'creature', 'attacks', 'face/off', 'remaining', 'characters', 'fight', 'survive', 'initial', 'scenes', 'exploration', 'discovery', 'are', 'decent', 'once', 'creature', 'life', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'mind', 'typical', 'horror', 'flick', 'kind', 'goofy', 'looking', 'monster', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'other', 'sci-fi/horror', 'movie', 'monsters', 'have', 'been.Personally', 'one', 'remake/pre-quel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'really', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'Sure', 'little', 'tension', 'few', 'jolts', 'acting', 'ok', 'type', 'flick', 'Mary', 'shine', 'one', 'breakout', 'stars', 'Hollywood', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'involve', 'much', 'thought', 'fairly', 'straight', 'foward', 'point', 'stated', 'other', 'reviews', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'do', 'tie', 'beginning', '1982', 'film', 'guess', 'was', 'decent', 'touch', 'However', 'really', 'kinda', 'boring', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'throw', 'away', 'one', 'dimensional', '*1/2', '4', 'stars']",N/A

1506173,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B00605MY0S,Jordan David,"[10, 23]","I'm going to immediately get this out of the way and make it clear that Matthijs van Heijningen has a preposterously difficult name to type, let alone pronounce, and will hereafter refer to him simply as ""the director"". That aside, his name may very well be the most intriguing element of an otherwise pedestrian prequel to John Carpenter's masterful '82 horror film. And yet, quite ironically, Carpenter's work itself truly does its successor no favors in allowing a unique be newly developed.The end result is something that is bound by too many predeterminations and, therefore, a disappointing ability to tap into ambition. Look, it's a prequel, through and through. Not that the marketing team necessarily cared for that to slip but, as a prequel, it inaverdently does the one thing any director can admit to fearing: Limiting one's creativity. Sloppy detours intermittently show themselves throughout the film, things that would perplex a viewer without a knowledge of where the movie's foundations lie. Largely pointless questions are clumsily answered that, even for a diehard fan of the original such as myself, were hardly burning to be answered in the first place.Horror thrives on these uncertainties, and to seek closure for any film pertaining to the genre is almost contradictory to the essence. With that said, was I not eagerly anticipating this film as a proponent of Carpenter's original? Of course I was. As a work of cinema, The Thing is blessed with key factors in its setting and premise that trigger immediate intrigue with the audience. The ""thing"" itself is a masterclass in monster making, igniting both spectrums of our fear and paranoia by freely transitioning between the unknown and the absolutely vile. Terror can be at its best when it's right before our eyes and, yet, somehow invisible.Carpenter took these themes and used it to conduct the closed experiment that took place within the confines of the arctic research facility in which the original took place, drawing a bead on the dozen or so men who slowly turned against each other until fragile authorities were built. It's the same story here with Kate, played by the ever lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as she struggles to retain order among the norweigan founders of the thing. Despite being only 5 minutes shorter than the original, the prequel somehow feels infinitely more anxious and frantic as pacts are made and broken in about as much time as it would take to get up and grab a soda refill. The remarkable tension that grew to a fever pitch in Carpenter's work is a fleeting visitor here. When it's present, it works just as well, but the intervals in which it's not have nothing to offer us.Again, there's a persistent lack of vision that handicaps the director's half-hearted attempts to bring new things to the table. The effort's glaringly present, nonetheless, and one particular scene that shares no ties to the predecessor is a nail biter as Kate desperately attempts to discern between those who are infected and those who are not. And, to be ""infected"", is to witness the film's (predictably) strongest asset, and you can almost hear the director's sighs of relief when any scene involving the thing's many incarnations make themselves known; at last, an opportunity to flex the imagination.Lacking the shocking nature of the original, who's practical special effects were critically lauded for being remarkably gory and absurd, those seen her still retain a gleeful creativity that put most other monsters to shame in this era. Bones and flesh distort and people are assaulted in shamelessly gruesome ways. It's the one thing in the film that achieves parity in greatness between itself and its superior predecessor, with actor Ulrich Thomsen's variation (yeah, he dies - people die in horror movies) almost singlehandedly redeeming an otherwise stupendously dull third act. Almost. Indeed, things do quickly fall apart when the expendable bodies start thinning out.It's a testament to Carpenter's prowess in methodical, efficient filmmaking that the original's rising action towards its grim climax never lost any of its suspensful drive. For Heijninenblahblah, he's an unfortunate slave to whatever the original film alluded to, all the way to the rolling credits.",2,The Thing,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,4277,"[""'m"", 'going', 'immediately', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'make', 'clear', 'Matthijs', 'van', 'Heijningen', 'preposterously', 'difficult', 'name', 'type', 'let', 'alone', 'pronounce', 'will', 'hereafter', 'refer', 'simply', 'director', 'aside', 'name', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'most', 'intriguing', 'element', 'otherwise', 'pedestrian', 'prequel', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'masterful', ""'82"", 'horror', 'film', 'yet', 'quite', 'ironically', 'Carpenter', 'work', 'truly', 'successor', 'favors', 'allowing', 'unique', 'be', 'newly', 'developed.The', 'end', 'result', 'something', 'bound', 'too', 'many', 'predeterminations', 'therefore', 'disappointing', 'ability', 'tap', 'ambition', 'Look', 'prequel', 'Not', 'marketing', 'team', 'necessarily', 'cared', 'slip', 'prequel', 'inaverdently', 'one', 'thing', 'director', 'can', 'admit', 'fearing', 'Limiting', 'one', 'creativity', 'Sloppy', 'detours', 'intermittently', 'show', 'film', 'things', 'would', 'perplex', 'viewer', 'knowledge', 'where', 'movie', 'foundations', 'lie', 'Largely', 'pointless', 'questions', 'are', 'clumsily', 'answered', 'even', 'diehard', 'fan', 'original', 'such', 'were', 'hardly', 'burning', 'be', 'answered', 'first', 'place.Horror', 'thrives', 'uncertainties', 'seek', 'closure', 'film', 'pertaining', 'genre', 'almost', 'contradictory', 'essence', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'film', 'proponent', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'course', 'was', 'work', 'cinema', 'Thing', 'blessed', 'key', 'factors', 'setting', 'premise', 'trigger', 'immediate', 'intrigue', 'audience', 'thing', 'masterclass', 'monster', 'making', 'igniting', 'spectrums', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'freely', 'transitioning', 'unknown', 'absolutely', 'vile', 'Terror', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'when', 'right', 'eyes', 'yet', 'somehow', 'invisible.Carpenter', 'took', 'themes', 'used', 'conduct', 'closed', 'experiment', 'took', 'place', 'confines', 'arctic', 'research', 'facility', 'original', 'took', 'place', 'drawing', 'bead', 'dozen', 'so', 'men', 'who', 'slowly', 'turned', 'other', 'fragile', 'authorities', 'were', 'built', 'same', 'story', 'here', 'Kate', 'played', 'ever', 'lovely', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'retain', 'order', 'norweigan', 'founders', 'thing', 'being', 'only', '5', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'original', 'prequel', 'somehow', 'infinitely', 'more', 'anxious', 'frantic', 'pacts', 'are', 'made', 'broken', 'about', 'much', 'time', 'would', 'take', 'get', 'up', 'grab', 'soda', 'refill', 'remarkable', 'tension', 'grew', 'fever', 'pitch', 'Carpenter', 'work', 'fleeting', 'visitor', 'here', 'When', 'present', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'intervals', 'not', 'have', 'nothing', 'offer', 'us.Again', 'persistent', 'lack', 'vision', 'director', 'half-hearted', 'attempts', 'bring', 'new', 'things', 'table', 'effort', 'glaringly', 'present', 'nonetheless', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'shares', 'ties', 'predecessor', 'nail', 'biter', 'Kate', 'desperately', 'discern', 'who', 'are', 'infected', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'infected', 'witness', 'film', 'predictably', 'strongest', 'asset', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'director', 'sighs', 'relief', 'when', 'scene', 'involving', 'thing', 'many', 'incarnations', 'make', 'known', 'last', 'opportunity', 'flex', 'imagination.Lacking', 'shocking', 'nature', 'original', 'who', 'practical', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'critically', 'lauded', 'being', 'remarkably', 'gory', 'absurd', 'seen', 'still', 'retain', 'gleeful', 'creativity', 'put', 'most', 'other', 'monsters', 'shame', 'era', 'Bones', 'flesh', 'distort', 'people', 'are', 'assaulted', 'shamelessly', 'gruesome', 'ways', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'parity', 'greatness', 'superior', 'predecessor', 'actor', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'variation', 'yeah', 'people', 'die', 'horror', 'movies', 'almost', 'singlehandedly', 'redeeming', 'otherwise', 'stupendously', 'dull', 'third', 'act', 'Almost', 'Indeed', 'things', 'do', 'quickly', 'fall', 'apart', 'when', 'expendable', 'bodies', 'start', 'thinning', 'out.It', 'testament', 'Carpenter', 'prowess', 'methodical', 'efficient', 'filmmaking', 'original', 'rising', 'action', 'grim', 'climax', 'never', 'lost', 'suspensful', 'drive', 'Heijninenblahblah', 'unfortunate', 'slave', 'whatever', 'original', 'film', 'alluded', 'way', 'rolling', 'credits']",N/A

I will do 2002 in film & 20 years ago on my other account. But I'm going to review a movie that wasn't wanted & wasn't needed at all. As you know it's this movie The Thing prequel, premake preboot it is what it is it's a back door remake. Let me tell you all why this movie was completebulls h i t. Back iin 2004 John Carpenter wanted to do a sequel to The Thing Universal said no Carpenter said this to Empire Magazine in October of 04 ""I have a great story for part 2 which kicks off with the 2 characters left alive from the last movie. I'm interested in doing it. Unfortantly I dont't think Universal is. Well there interested in doing it but there not interested in having me direct it! You know that the studio will end getting some commercials hotshot to direct it & that will be that. I don't care I'm certaintly not going to beg. Despite the fact that these people don't even get The Thing even though it is it's a favorite film of my own."" He's right they got some tool in Mattijs van Henijnigen like the drink only not spelled the same. This gy has directed Zien & Red Rain Red Rain was a short film from 96. Zien was a musical from 2004 he has about as much credibillity directing a horror movie let alone a prequel to 1 of the best horror movies ever made as George Tillman did directing an action movie. So Universal said no NO! To a sequel directed by John Carpenter & Kurt Russell & Keith David returning in favor of a prequel. I'm sorry I hate prequels imo there not needed the only time a prequel is good is if it's Missing In Action 2, Psycho IV, He l lraise Bloodline which serves as a sequel & a prequel both or Terminalor Salvation which again is a prequel & sequel both. The movie stars Mary Elizabeth Weinstead as Kate Lloyd & I'd be lying if I said she was complete s h i t but I didn't care about her character 1 way or the other. Also stars Joel Edgerton as Sam Carter, Ulrich Thmpsen  as Dr Sander Halverson & Eric Christen Olsen as Adam, Now if you love this movie & think it is a wonderful companion piece then be my guest but don't try to comment & tell that it's good this is my opinion. Ok so you start off these 3 Norwegians have discovered an Alien Body frozen in the ice & right off the bat you have 1 of these Norweigians tell a joke. ""A man & a woman are doing it 1 night & there young son comes in & is horrified. The Woman says what do we do? Then the man says I'll take care of this. The man finds his son on top of his Grandmother & he tells his dad it ain't so funny when it's your mother."" I pause right there & I stared cussing I was like WTF!? But then you're introduced to Kate Lloyd & the guy from NCIS LA & Dr Halverson. The Norwegians have found something so The Norwegians need an American to go to Antartica to tell them with the proper tools it will take half a day.. Really it's to have the final girl. I wouldn't know that was taking place in 1982 if it didn't say so at the beginning. Kate is listening to Who Could It Be Now by Men At Work cause it has to do with paranoia that's so brillant ha ha. The opening reminds me of AvP in it's look & feel cause they found something in Antartica & you have your Ellen Ripley knock off, So these group of Americans go to Antartica they get The Alien out of the ice & I swear to G o d you mean to tell me that they couldn't even get a real block of ice the had to use CGI. So there celebrating the find you have this guy looking at the ice some other guy comes from behind & says boo. Literally he says boo. So the creature breaks through the ice then you have that guy run down the hall in the same exact way as in The 82 film & you have a dog biting on the cage. You have these people looking for The Thing a tentical goes through this 1 guy & pulls in they set it on fire & kill it & try to figure out what is going on & this is the only time you get pratical effects when they have the body on the table so you have Kate who took a blood sample she finds out  that it can copy human cells perfecly just like this movie perfectly copies The 82 film. When they were looking at creature they had burned they found a metal object in it & it was from that guy that was killed earlier cause he had surgery on his arm. So later on this guy got sick he has to be taken out of the area Kate finds some teeth fillings in the bathroom cause The Thing can't assimlate metal. She tries to get Sam Carter to land The Helicopter 1 guy transforms into a creature in some turely awful CGI. The Helicopter crashes & we think Sam & The Helicopter piolet are dead. Kate tells everybody that they can't leave & that The Thing is coping it's vicims like I didn't already know that from The 82 movie. So then you have this 1 girl taking to Kate & then you get another horrid CGI transformation. That creature is burned. Then Sam & The Helicopter Piolet come back. They decided to do a blood test I already knew that going to the lab is torched. Cause Kate looks at there teeth to find out that there not human open your mouth. You find out that none of these people are infected & you know not everybody has teeth fillings by this movies logic if you don't have teeth filling you'refv c k e d. Sam & The Helicopter Piollet escaped they all run into them The Helicopter Piolet shoots this 1 guys Flamethrower Tank it blows up. They take this guy who is hurt to The REC room just like The 82 movie & we get some s h i t CGI transformation you have the low Flamethrower Fuel scene recreated The Windows death scene copied from The 82 film. The Thing kills The Helicopter Piolet gut it crawls up to a wounded Adam & rubs it's face up to his & never in a million years would I have thought that the body they found in The 82 mvoie woudl be part of the dip s h it from Dumb & Dumberer & NCIS LA. You have Dr Halverson escap cause he is infected they follow him which leads to a medioce fanale with Kate & The Thing. She throws a grenade in it's mouth & it dies. If the space ship worked all along why WHY oh why did it just go there The Thing is suppose to be Stealthy & don't tell me that oh this thing is brand new it's learning. In The Documentary Carpetnter says that it's been around for 1,000 of years theres no fan fiction allowed in this dojo. Anyway Kate tells Sam you know who I knew you were human your ear ring she burns him & WOW! The Final Girl I haven't seen that before in except for 50 other fv c k in g horror movies. That Sam guy mentioned that we need to get to The Russian Outpost they never mentioned that in The 82 film & in thiis film they never mentioned The American Outpost. Then OMG this Helicopter lands at The Norwegian Base then all of a sudden a dog pops out of it there was only 1 dog & it was killed so where did it come from so they chased it down the ending of that was the start of the 82 film & if I didn't rent this I would've broken the disc & I got it with a gift card thankfully. This movie is a disgrace it is an insault to John Carpetnter it's an insautl to me being a massive fan of the 1982 film I even liked the original The Thibg From Another World so I know that The Thing was a remake but you know what it became it's own movei not a carbon copy. A movie I'll mention Levithatn it gets s h i t on people complain that it is a ripoff of Alien & The Thing I'm sorry it had characters that you cared about Peter Weller Richard Crenna, Ernie Hudson, Amanda Pays, Lisa Eilbacher & Daniel Stern. It had an inferction plot but it was underwater & did enough where it became it's own movie. Levithan didn't haves # ! t effects that looked like video game graphichs. The writer even said pratical effects will be used whenever possible wtf ever the only time I saw pratical was on the autopsy table maybe. I'm hard on CGI most of the time cause pratical effects look better effects from an almost 30 year old movie look better than anything today. It's sad that old school pratical effects are being phased out in favor of CGI. CGI was never ment to replace old school pratical effects it was to be used to do the impsooible like in T2 & The Abyss.CGI will never ever ever ever ever top pratical effects by the masters like Rob Bottin, Rick Baker, K&B John Carl Bechler & The Late Stan Winston. & please don't tell me that CGI is better cause you will just get c us se d out. The characters are forgetable Kate Lloyd is just another final girl. Joel Edgerton doesn't do much he's barley in the movie & he has 2nd billing. Eric Christen Olsen is a wimp. Urlich Thompsen is nothing special. Why was this movie made we didn't need to know what happend to The Norwegian's we know enogh that someF U B AR I N G went on. So if you want to know what happend to The Norwegian's just watch the 1st 15 or 20 minutes of John Carpenters The Thing. Don't tell me that it's a story that needed to be told a story that needed to be told was a sequel with John Carpenter coming back to direct with Kurt Russell returning. I mean think of the possibilities of The Thing in a city or The Thing in a deset or The Thing in a jungle. So this was a cash iin with 1 note characters video game graphic effects & a plot I don't care about. I remember MacReady, Windows, Norris, Dr Blair, Childs, Nauls, Gerry & Palmer why cause I cared about them. I remember The Dog transformation scene Infermary Scene The Norris transformation scene I remeber a lot of scenes. This doesn't stand on it's own legs it's just a rehash bottom line.",1,Can't believe that Universal chose a prequel over a sequel with John Carpenter directing & Russell coming back

Of course ""Alien"" writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett surely knew the original ""The Thing From Another World"" made in 1951 and the original story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell, so cross pollination could have been present from the beginning, but it looks like this ""The Thing"" took a lot of its look from ""Alien"".The plot of ""The Thing"" is close to the 1951 original and the 1982 remake, this ""Thing"" is supposed to be a prequel to the 1982 version starring Kurt Russell. An Antarctic scientific team discovers an alien spaceship under the ice and they inadvertently release an alien that has the ability to absorb and replicate its victims while the others in the camp try to scientifically deduce who the replicated are and to devise tests to prove who is human and who is not while the death toll rises.In this 2011 version Mary Elizabeth Winsted plays paleontologist Kate Lloyd who is brought in when the spaceship is discovered with an ""organism"" nearby. When ""The Thing"" is released from the ice, she's takes the Kurt Russell/Sigourney Weaver lead of finding ""The Thing"" hiding amongst them. The acting all around is good, there's nothing over the top and all the performances are believable, although by the end just about everybody has been screaming in horror and running down hallways or screaming as they change into ""The Thing.""One thing ""The Thing"" does that other movies don't do is go inside the spaceship and that's where we see a lot of the alien comparisons, it looks like the set designers for ""The Thing"" were either highly influenced by ""Alien"", H.R. Giger or just had left over sets from the spaceships of ""Alien.""Despite the ""Alien""/""The Thing"" interbreeding there was a lot of surprises in the story and the action kept the movie moving along without it being rote or formulaic, and there's a little bit of tension, but not too much. ""The Thing"" is for those who haven't seen either of the previous movies and if you have you'll still find yourself entertained and occasionally surprised.Bonus features include: Directors commentary, deleted scenes, and the documentaries and featurettes, ""The Thing Evolves"" and ""Fire and Ice"".",3,The Thing Absorbs Alien,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,2347,"['new', 'version', 'Thing', 'have', 'absorbed', 'lot', 'Alien', 'stories', 'are', 'fairly', 'similar', 'alien', 'creature', 'infects', 'isolated', 'humans', 'killing', 'off', 'course', 'Alien', 'writers', 'Dan', ""O'Bannon"", 'Ronald', 'Shusett', 'surely', 'knew', 'original', 'Thing', 'World', 'made', '1951', 'original', 'story', 'Who', 'John', 'W.', 'Campbell', 'so', 'cross', 'pollination', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'present', 'beginning', 'Thing', 'took', 'lot', 'look', 'Alien', '.The', 'plot', 'Thing', 'close', '1951', 'original', '1982', 'remake', 'Thing', 'supposed', 'be', 'prequel', '1982', 'version', 'starring', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Antarctic', 'scientific', 'team', 'alien', 'spaceship', 'ice', 'inadvertently', 'release', 'alien', 'ability', 'absorb', 'replicate', 'victims', 'others', 'camp', 'try', 'scientifically', 'deduce', 'who', 'replicated', 'are', 'devise', 'tests', 'prove', 'who', 'human', 'who', 'not', 'death', 'toll', 'rises.In', '2011', 'version', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winsted', 'plays', 'paleontologist', 'Kate', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'brought', 'when', 'spaceship', 'discovered', 'organism', 'nearby', 'When', 'Thing', 'released', 'ice', 'Kurt', 'Russell/Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'lead', 'finding', 'Thing', 'hiding', 'amongst', 'acting', 'good', 'nothing', 'top', 'performances', 'are', 'believable', 'end', 'just', 'everybody', 'been', 'screaming', 'horror', 'running', 'down', 'hallways', 'screaming', 'change', 'Thing', 'One', 'thing', 'Thing', 'other', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'go', 'spaceship', 'where', 'see', 'lot', 'alien', 'comparisons', 'set', 'designers', 'Thing', 'were', 'highly', 'influenced', 'Alien', 'H.R', 'Giger', 'just', 'had', 'left', 'over', 'sets', 'spaceships', 'Alien', 'Alien', '/', 'Thing', 'interbreeding', 'was', 'lot', 'surprises', 'story', 'action', 'kept', 'movie', 'moving', 'along', 'being', 'rote', 'formulaic', 'little', 'bit', 'tension', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'Thing', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'previous', 'movies', 'have', ""'ll"", 'still', 'find', 'entertained', 'occasionally', 'surprised.Bonus', 'features', 'include', 'Directors', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'documentaries', 'featurettes', 'Thing', 'Evolves', 'Fire', 'Ice']",N/A

The prequel to John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is a perfect example.  I'll start off by saying that I wasn't impressed with Carpenter's film.  Just another 'spam in a can' flick.  But this!  The dialogue is insulting to the cast.  The special effects have me convinced that nothing in this area has moved forward since 1982.  They looked exactly the same as those used in the Carpenter film. The entire cast was boring.  No emotions, nothing to like about them; I reached a point about thirty minutes in that the only reason I would stay with the film was to watch everyone die.  And because this story has already been done to death, there is absolutely NO suspense.  Nothing ever had me wondering what would happen next.  The film is sleep-inducing.  And why is everything so dark?  Most of the time it's impossible to tell what's happening because you can't see anything.  What was the director hiding in the dark?  Evidently not much.  And all of the subtitles were very distracting.  This is the type of film that is only hurt by subtitles, although at least white subtitles against a constantly black background are at least easy to read.  This movie bites.

This one, on the other hand, is just a cheap, shoddy imitation of what Carpenter did.  Carpenter knew how to build an atmosphere of isolation, dread, and distrust: the suspense starts right away and just keeps building and building from there.

A 0.5 to Carpenter's 1.0?  Anyway, no matter how you slice it, it is a valiant effort with passable acting and an attempt to marry the CGI of today with the practical effects of Carpenter's effort.Unfortunately, fans are so strongly supportive of Carpenter's movie, that this movie received a lot of flack and felt unnecessary.  The strongest acting is crafted by the Norwegian cast and Joel Edgerton who balances out Winstead's heroine.  The CGI lacks the depth of the practical effects burned into our consciousness by the 80's film.  And you can't help to feel that this movie lacks SOMETHING!  It successfully leads right into Carpenter's story, even borrowing the theme from that film for the end credits.  But it misses the mark somehow.

My love for Carpenter's film is great: it isn't perfect but the tension can be cut with a knife. The all male cast was perfect for what the film required. I was a bit disappointed they had chicks in this flick (girls are great but the tension was gone). As much as the producers and directors said they were fans of the first film, they made mistakes that should not have been made.First, in the '82 movie, when Mac and Doc are visiting the camp, they come up steps to the bloody axe -the '11 movie has a dead end as Kate torches the little hand things on a wall where the steps would be for the '82 visit.Next when Mac finds the ice casing the Thing was frozen in, I don't really see the roof as being demolished, though the '82 film doesn't offer a great view, admittedly.Mac and Copper go outside and find the corpses with kerosene cans around them. The only time I remember seeing kerosene in the '11 movie was when they burned the Thing after it kills Henrick and then when it attacks the doctor trying to get to Kate. They didn't use kerosene to burn the ""two-head"" monster -Kate torched it, it jumped thru a wall, then she kept torching it.When Mac and Copper get back to camp, the video of the Norwegian expedition shows them using thermite charges to blow up the ice around the ship or the creature -yet in the '11 movie the ship is still buried until the very end when the engines melt the ice and the Thing was supposedly cut free from the ice, still encased in a block of it.Get the picture here? Though admirable, the producers of the '11 prequel did not pay that close attention. Unless I missed something but these are important things. The dog at the end that runs off looks nothing like the dog in the '82 version -this is a direct connection for the films. (Remember the scene in the rec room, before the Thing gets free and Lars is petting his dog?) -that is supposed to be the ""Thing"" dog at the end since the Thing killed the dog after it's escape.Again, Carpenter's film isn't perfect but it's a masterpiece in horror and paranoia -the new film, should have had everyone on the edge of their seats with palatable tension but (except for not knowing what to expect) this movie didn't have the tension. The new film should have set the tone and taken it a step further -real adrenaline rushed paranoia.Another flub is when Kate (barely) escapes the other chick ""Thing"" and it attacks the poor doctor -suddenly, outta nowhere Lars comes running up with the flamethrower -? How did he know to bring it? In the '82 film, Childs was told to bring the flamethrower. The '11 movie assumes too much.I respect that they used many practical elements but some of the CGI actually looked like, well, CGI. The scene where Adam is attacked and the Thing is merging its face with his, its seemed to me they didn't finish that CGI very well, watch it a few times. I only rated it as high as I did outta respect for Carpenter's movie.The characters, though well played, looked too clean. The grit and dirt of the '82 film was lost (admittedly there is 29 years separating the two movies) but all the characters didn't look weather beaten or even cold. The girls looked too nice, the guys too sharp and clean. Not enough facial hair, unkempt or ill trimmed. It was too slick. The Thing attacks were too ""one after the other"" -no suspense. How did half the people (including the guy on the helicopter and the other chick) become Things? In the '82 movie, you can kind of get a timeline of when most everyone got attacked -not all mind you but most.In the end, if you're a fan of the '82 Carpenter film, stay that way -you may be disappointed in this prequel. I was. Again, I rated it three stars out of respect for what Carpenter did in 1982. He unleashed the Thing.",3,Not the Thing I thought it would be,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,3919,"['Well', 'was', 'psyched', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', '-I', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'theaters', 'got', 'blu-ray', 'put', 'watch', 'well', '-hmmm', 'love', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'great', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'tension', 'can', 'be', 'cut', 'knife', 'male', 'cast', 'was', 'perfect', 'what', 'film', 'required', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'had', 'chicks', 'flick', 'girls', 'are', 'great', 'tension', 'was', 'gone', 'As', 'much', 'producers', 'directors', 'said', 'were', 'fans', 'first', 'film', 'made', 'mistakes', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made.First', ""'82"", 'movie', 'when', 'Mac', 'Doc', 'are', 'visiting', 'camp', 'come', 'up', 'steps', 'bloody', '-the', ""'11"", 'movie', 'dead', 'end', 'Kate', 'little', 'hand', 'things', 'wall', 'where', 'steps', 'would', 'be', ""'82"", 'visit.Next', 'when', 'Mac', 'ice', 'casing', 'Thing', 'was', 'frozen', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'roof', 'being', 'demolished', ""'82"", 'film', ""n't"", 'offer', 'great', 'view', 'admittedly.Mac', 'Copper', 'go', 'outside', 'find', 'corpses', 'kerosene', 'cans', 'only', 'time', 'remember', 'seeing', 'kerosene', ""'11"", 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'burned', 'Thing', 'Henrick', 'then', 'when', 'doctor', 'trying', 'get', 'Kate', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'kerosene', 'burn', 'two-head', 'monster', '-Kate', 'torched', 'jumped', 'thru', 'wall', 'then', 'kept', 'torching', 'it.When', 'Mac', 'Copper', 'get', 'back', 'camp', 'video', 'Norwegian', 'expedition', 'using', 'thermite', 'charges', 'blow', 'up', 'ice', 'ship', 'creature', ""'11"", 'movie', 'ship', 'still', 'buried', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'engines', 'melt', 'ice', 'Thing', 'was', 'supposedly', 'cut', 'free', 'ice', 'still', 'encased', 'block', 'it.Get', 'picture', 'here', 'Though', 'admirable', 'producers', ""'11"", 'prequel', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'missed', 'something', 'are', 'important', 'things', 'dog', 'end', 'nothing', 'dog', ""'82"", 'version', '-this', 'direct', 'connection', 'films', 'Remember', 'scene', 'rec', 'room', 'Thing', 'free', 'Lars', 'petting', 'dog', '-that', 'supposed', 'be', 'Thing', 'dog', 'end', 'Thing', 'killed', 'dog', 'escape.Again', 'Carpenter', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'masterpiece', 'horror', 'paranoia', '-the', 'new', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'everyone', 'edge', 'seats', 'palatable', 'tension', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'tension', 'new', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'set', 'tone', 'taken', 'step', 'further', '-real', 'adrenaline', 'rushed', 'paranoia.Another', 'flub', 'when', 'Kate', 'barely', 'other', 'chick', 'Thing', 'poor', 'doctor', '-suddenly', 'nowhere', 'Lars', 'running', 'up', 'flamethrower', 'How', 'did', 'know', 'bring', ""'82"", 'film', 'Childs', 'was', 'told', 'bring', 'flamethrower', ""'11"", 'movie', 'too', 'much.I', 'respect', 'used', 'many', 'practical', 'elements', 'CGI', 'actually', 'looked', 'well', 'CGI', 'scene', 'where', 'Adam', 'attacked', 'Thing', 'merging', 'face', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'CGI', 'very', 'well', 'watch', 'few', 'times', 'only', 'rated', 'as', 'high', 'did', 'outta', 'respect', 'Carpenter', 'movie.The', 'characters', 'though', 'well', 'played', 'looked', 'too', 'clean', 'grit', 'dirt', ""'82"", 'film', 'was', 'lost', 'admittedly', '29', 'years', 'separating', 'two', 'movies', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'weather', 'beaten', 'even', 'cold', 'girls', 'looked', 'too', 'nice', 'guys', 'too', 'sharp', 'clean', 'Not', 'enough', 'facial', 'hair', 'unkempt', 'ill', 'trimmed', 'was', 'too', 'slick', 'Thing', 'attacks', 'were', 'too', 'one', 'other', '-no', 'suspense', 'How', 'did', 'people', 'including', 'guy', 'helicopter', 'other', 'chick', 'become', 'Things', ""'82"", 'movie', 'can', 'kind', 'get', 'timeline', 'when', 'most', 'everyone', 'got', 'attacked', 'mind', 'most.In', 'end', ""'re"", 'fan', ""'82"", 'Carpenter', 'film', 'stay', 'way', '-you', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'prequel', 'was', 'Again', 'rated', 'three', 'respect', 'what', 'Carpenter', 'did', '1982', 'unleashed', 'Thing']",N/A

they had done a Prequel film, & that Mary Elizabeth Winstead(Die Hard 4) was in it (why have we not seen more of her??), I immediately ordered both films on Amazon, the 82' film is about the only Kurt Russell film that I didn't have, not having seen the 82' film in so long, I was able to judge both films on their own merit, & I have to say the filmakers were smart to do a Prequel, in this one we find out what happened to the Norweign outpost, these team members unearth the alien who has been buried in Antartica for thousands of years, Winstead is Kate who is a scientist & discovers that the alien can replicate humans, just as Wilford Brimley realized in the 82' film, she tries desperately to warn the others, but the alien thaws out & goes on its killing spree & learns how to replicate the others, Joel Edgerton(young Owen in ""Star Wars Ep II)& the guy who played Mr.Ecko in ""Lost"" are here as the helicopter pilots who are the first to discover the ""Thing"" & try to warn the others as well, Winstead's Kate pretty much becomes the hero who is in many ways equal to Kurt Russell's character in the 82' film, we discover how the two-headed creature came to be, the ax in the wall, the dead guy Russell & Richard Dysart find in the 82' film, & why he committed suiside, but most of all, we discover that the helicopter sniper seen at the beginning of the 82' film is actually a survivor hell bent on destroying the dog seen running at the end of this one, I really liked how the this one runs directly into the 82' film, this is a Prequel done right, when I went to watch the 82' film with Kurt Russell I was amazed at how well the two films connected to one another, & loved this aspect of it, & some reviewers have mentioned inconsistencies with the spaceship in the snow, in the 2011 film, it is buried underneath the ice, in the 82' film it is not, however if you watch the very end of the 2011 film where Winstead & Edgerton are looking for the alien, he tries to leave, but is intercepted by them, the alien had fired in engines, only to turn them off to deal with Winstead & Edgerton, it can be assumed that the heat of the engines melted the above snow roof which in turn would make it visable as seen in the 82' film, highly recommend this one to fans of the 1982 film.Spoilers.....Winstead's fate becomes unknown just as Kurt Russell & Keith David's fate in the 82'

In fact, I think they could make a compelling double feature.  It is in fact 1982 and a Norwegian group of scientists in Antarctica discover an anomaly located deep below the ice.  An American helicopter crew shuttle the lead scientist (Ulrich Thomsen) who was summoned from Norway to check out what's what.  Along for the ride to help out is Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) an expert on extracting animal carcasses.  They believe they have found an alien pilot frozen in the ice outside a space vehicle that crashed a hundred thousand years earlier.Winstead is an interesting choice to play what becomes the heroine of the story.  She is shy, attractive but plain and somewhat dorky.  Here she is with a group of a dozen or so Norwegian men and one woman.  Remind you of anyone?  Try Sigourney Weaver of the ""Alien"" franchise.  After ""The Thing"" escapes its now melting block of ice, it is Kate who discovers that it has the ability to replicate human cells and take over their bodies.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers were anxious to show off the creature in various stages of being, much too early in the movie.  Most great horror films hold back on showing the creature in order to build more suspense and anticipation.  Still, there are plenty of scenes to jump start the heart if that's what you're after.""The Thing"" really doesn't give us anything we haven't already learned from the '82 version and to a lesser extent the 1951 original.  The special effects are a modest boost based on current technology.  Most interesting is the homage paid to those earlier films, especially John Carpenter's.  There are brief interludes of Carpenter's quick musical drumbeats and the ending sequence leads perfectly to the opening of Carpenter's terrific film.

It shows what went down at the Norwegian's camp that Macready (Kurt Russell) and his crew investigated in John Carpenter's 1982 classic. You know, an alien is found frozen in ice that has the ability to copy other organisms and often twist itself into grotesque forms before killing someone. Unfortunately it is almost an exact copy of the last movie, but with weaker characters and hit and miss CGI. The nearly 30 year old practical effects blow away the SFX here, but they are not so horrendous that it ruins the whole experience. The best parts of this prequel are when the paranoia sets in and nobody trusts anyone. The cast is better than your average horror movie nowadays. Mary Elizabeth Winestead does a good job as the lead character, but nobody is developed enough to care about. I did like how the scenes during the end credits directly leads into Carpenter's The Thing. We even get a few of those eerie bass lines that brought so much tension all those years ago.Some will like it for being a companion piece to the 1982 film and others will hate it just because it doesn't achieve any level of greatness, or try to be anything other than a copy (ha, fits the theme of the movie) of what came before.On a side note, I always wondered what the true form of The Thing creature actually looked like. The alien that is frozen in the block of ice has claws and doesn't resemble something that could build such a huge and complex spaceship. My theory is that the ""Thing"" infected the alien crew of the ship on some planet and caused them to crash on Earth. Uh oh, I can see it now. The Thing vs. Aliens vs. Predators!

During the original movie, many questions were left unanswered, what happened in the Norwegian camp? How did the Thing looked like while it was still in the ice? What happened to McReady and Childs? Unfortunately, Hollywood likes to take steps back instead of forwards and we will never know of McReady and Childs (unless a sequel is made, hopefully).The prequel takes place just before the original when a group of Norwegians stumble upon an alien spacecraft buried deep in the ice, the customary grumpy scientist flies to America and recruits the young hero, Kate Lloyd to go and discover what lies underneath the ice. The cast is filled with international stars, which is refreshing, however, if the filmmakers wanted to keep with the original tone set by the first movie, the Norwegian camp probably would have filled with men doing their work just like in Carpenter's film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is one dimensional and unlikable, she is clearly a Ripley clone where you know no danger will come to her and the story is too afraid to cause her any harm other than her hair getting messy, unfortunately there is no strong central character to root for like in the original. The writer tries very hard to tell a compelling story, filled with suspense and horror and sadly misses the point.I know many reviews compare this movie to the original but is what happens when a prequel/sequel fails to tell a story and keep the audience interested. Everybody in the camp are just victims for the CGI Thing and the visual effects rely too heavily on CGI to convince anybody that the Thing is something to be feared. The Thing's first, brief appearance is interesting and then is never seen again, the rest is just sloppy mash ups of victims and guts. The story leaves off for a sequel but by the end of the movie, you feel nothing for Kate and the writer tries to sneak in the opening scene of the first film in an effort to redeem itself but at the end, it is simply better to enjoy the original and ignore this one.The Blu-ray does deliver a clear picture and sound,the extra features are worth a look at and the movie looks amazing on a 1080P TV.The Thing's ship looks amazing and the film does capture a bit of the doomed atmosphere of the original, except you can see the Thing a mile coming and all the suspense of where the Thing is hiding among the cast is gone.

It captured a certain paranoia of the times, made some oblique social commentary and applied a relatively decent budget to an essentially B movie story.  In particular, it showed visually a creativity in effects which had not been seen before - notable for their shot in-camera reality.This time round, we have the same B-movie story retrod.  Although it is a prequel, telling the story from the Norwegian camp that Kurt Russell and co. visit in the Carpenter version, it hits many of the same beats - the twist on the blood test scene is interesting, for example.  However, we never quite get into the characters or atmosphere of the camp in the way that Carpenter set up, and certainly the tension is never generated in the same way.  There are no shocks and surprises, other than the cheap `make a loud noise to give the audience a jump' type, mostly because the film eschews the sense of distrust caused by a creature that only reveals itself when forced to.. here the creature seems to appear at the drop of a hat.  The effects are (mostly) CG this time round, which I assumed would rob them of their real-feel bite.. and yet, they have stuck closely to the aesthetics of the original so the CG-ness is played down in a way that does them credit.  Although the characters never feel particularly well defined, the cast do their best - Mary Elizabeth Winstead is actually satisfyingly low key and unshowy, and comes across almost Ripley-like in her ability to rise to the challenge, particularly in the final scenes, which edge away from the genre in the direction of sci-fi.  The rest of the cast all look convincing, but we don't feel we know them enough to care much what happens.All in all, not a disaster then.. just oddly irrelevant and unnecessary.  It's not badly done, one just ends up wondering why do a remake / reimagining / prequel if you don't have anything new to bring to the table?

It borrows many of the scenes and dialogue from the JC version. Its almost like they were going for a reboot and decided to go down another track. The other issue is the casting. The first 2 movies had great dialogue with a cast that meshed together well. All of the characters in this one are weak, nondescript and completely forgettable. Yes paranoia is the underlying theme. Yet it would have been more interesting if some characters got along better in order to build up to some sort of tension.  Most of the characters are too aloof and underwritten to care about them.

Well, it turned out it is a prequel to a remake, the 1982 version. I still was skeptical about a prequel of a movie from almost 30 years ago. Surprisingly I was blow away by the little things that were thrown into the 2011 prequel which linked to the 1982 version. Little things like the ax in the wall that Kurt Russell sees when he first visits the Norwegian base, the burnt Thing outside the base as well as so many other little similarities which perfectly link the two movies. It was very well done and completely took me off guard as I expected this to be a quick slasher remake just to make cash for Universal.They did a great job of respecting the original work and perfectly blending the end of this film into the beginning of the 1982 version of The Thing with Kurt Russell. Make sure you stay for the credits as little clips connect to the start of the 1982 version.Yes, The Thing alien was pretty much all CGI, however they did a really good job of it and some things actually surprised me how well they did it and how far they took it. The cast and acting was perfect and felt right throughout the film. Yes, it lacked some character development, however they used fear and the casts' reactions as a solid character introduction.Nothing will ever top the 1982 version of The Thing, however this 2011 version of The Thing is a perfect Prequel to that and I could not have asked for a better horror flick. One recommendation I have is that if you see the 2011 The Thing in theaters or watch it at home on Blu, make sure to clear your schedule and watch the 2011 version and the 1982 version back to back. You will be quite surprised by the similarities and the amazing level of detail to each and every scene. The makers of the 2011 The Thing must be huge fans of the 1982 version as they made a perfect prequel to such an amazing film.VideoVideo codec: TBAVideo resolution: 1080pOriginal aspect ratio: 2.39:1AudioEnglish: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1English: Dolby Digital 2.0French (Canada): DTS 5.1Spanish: DTS 5.1English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1English: Dolby Digital 2.0French (Canada): DTS 5.1Spanish: DTS 5.1 (less)SubtitlesEnglish SDH, French, SpanishEnglish SDH, French, Spanish (less)Discs50GB Blu-ray DiscTwo-disc set (1 BD, 1 DVD)UV digital copyDVD copyMobile featuresPlaybackRegion A (B, C untested)",4,Great Prequel to the 1982 version of The Thing,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,2456,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'Thing', 'got', 'incredibly', 'upset', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'remake', 'Well', 'turned', 'out', 'prequel', 'remake', '1982', 'version', 'still', 'was', 'skeptical', 'prequel', 'movie', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Surprisingly', 'was', 'blow', 'away', 'little', 'things', 'were', 'thrown', '2011', 'prequel', 'linked', '1982', 'version', 'Little', 'things', 'ax', 'wall', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'when', 'first', 'Norwegian', 'base', 'burnt', 'Thing', 'base', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'little', 'similarities', 'perfectly', 'link', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'completely', 'took', 'off', 'guard', 'expected', 'be', 'quick', 'slasher', 'remake', 'just', 'make', 'cash', 'Universal.They', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'respecting', 'original', 'work', 'perfectly', 'blending', 'end', 'film', 'beginning', '1982', 'version', 'Thing', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Make', 'sure', 'stay', 'credits', 'little', 'clips', 'connect', 'start', '1982', 'version.Yes', 'Thing', 'alien', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'CGI', 'however', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'things', 'actually', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'how', 'far', 'took', 'cast', 'acting', 'was', 'perfect', 'felt', 'right', 'film', 'Yes', 'lacked', 'character', 'development', 'however', 'used', 'fear', 'casts', 'reactions', 'solid', 'character', 'introduction.Nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'top', '1982', 'version', 'Thing', 'however', '2011', 'version', 'Thing', 'perfect', 'Prequel', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'asked', 'better', 'horror', 'flick', 'One', 'recommendation', 'have', 'see', '2011', 'Thing', 'theaters', 'watch', 'home', 'Blu', 'make', 'sure', 'clear', 'schedule', 'watch', '2011', 'version', '1982', 'version', 'back', 'back', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'surprised', 'similarities', 'amazing', 'level', 'detail', 'scene', 'makers', '2011', 'Thing', 'must', 'be', 'huge', 'fans', '1982', 'version', 'made', 'perfect', 'prequel', 'amazing', 'film.VideoVideo', 'codec', 'TBAVideo', 'resolution', '1080pOriginal', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1AudioEnglish', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0French', 'Canada', '5.1Spanish', 'DTS', '5.1English', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0French', 'Canada', '5.1Spanish', 'DTS', '5.1', 'less', 'SubtitlesEnglish', 'SDH', 'French', 'SpanishEnglish', 'SDH', 'French', 'Spanish', 'less', 'Discs50GB', 'Blu-ray', 'DiscTwo-disc', 'set', '1', 'BD', '1', 'DVD', 'UV', 'digital', 'copyDVD', 'copyMobile', 'featuresPlaybackRegion', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'untested']",N/A

Maybe their daddys made them eat worms as kids when they went fishing as punishment for not catching enough fish?  Or maybe they currently have some sort of spastic colon or duodenumic disease and are tormented at night with intestigut monsters floppily, sloppily attacking them?  Or...maybe their I.Q. is simply minus 74.  Who can know these things?  Maybe they voted for Obama or Clinton and their brains have become half-eaten away as a result of a rare kind of subconscious self-flagellation where they've auto-infected their brains with Amazonian pinworms or something.

Along with that, it was terrifc the way they ended it to seamlessly stop where the JC version begins. Of course, the advent of CGI gives this film more leaway with the special effects, which are truly frightening. The cast is a major plus, as they all seem to git in with each other and the acting is superb. I especially liked the bit of levity when the Norwegians start singing and dancing to an old Norwegian tune. It was hilarious.

I liked it and enjoyed the upgrades to the 1982 version as well as the story enhancement in the form of a prequel.  The subject matter of not trusting the person standing next to you was at the core of the Carpenter version and was what made it great.  You get that same feeling here, as you expect, and the acting across the board is solid.  There is not a lot of character development explored but there was not much in the 82 version either.  That is probably a good thing because there are not a lot of people left standing in the end so the less you care about them the easier it is to see their fates played out.You do not have to see the Carpenter version to enjoy this film but for me it helped.  This is especially the case at the end as the filmmakers did a great job of tying this story to the 82 version.  It is such a great transition that watching this movie then the 82 film right after makes a lot of sense and was the first thing I wanted to do.  So if you have not seen the 82 film then watch it right after this one.  Not everything between the two movies syncs perfectly but there is more then enough to make the connection.  There are also a lot of things the two films have in common, again as you would expect.  The sets look the same, many of the scenes feel identical, the creature look is the same although much better with modern special effects.  All of these things make for a smooth transition between the two films going from this prequel to Carpenter's version.The Blu-Ray itself has very good video quality, not the best I have seen but far from the worst.  The audio is good when it needs to be but this is not an audio track that will match up with a disc like Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol but then again the filmmakers never intended it to be.  Basically the movie plays on Blu-Ray as the filmmakers intended it to and if there is any fault it would be in the way it was made as opposed to any issue with the product.  I love director's commentaries and I really enjoyed the one on this disc.  Not all commentaries are interesting but this one was and I love to hear about the creative process behind what you see on screen.Overall I really enjoyed this movie and like all films the best way to watch them is on Blu-Ray.

1506243,AUDW8J8GH0IDO,B00605MY0S,"ReAgent 6 ""Mixed media: movies, music and wha...","[2, 3]","Taken from me Blogsite!After reading all the lackluster reviews for the updated The Thing movie, I passed on the theatrical release and figure I'd wait for the DVD rental. Before picking up on the re-imaging, I thought it might be wise to watch the original 1951 Howard Hawking version along with John Carpenter's The Thing 1982 update.The Thing from another World (1951)I remember this B&W; classic from my childhood and being creeped out by the huge humanoid monster stalking through the hallways like an unstoppable Juggernaut. You didn't need special effects or sophisticated graphics to turn a man into an alien beast. Giant hands and a helmet, along with good physical acting, was enough to convince anyone back then.Watching the dialogue now reminds me of the different deliveries and sense of timing actors used in those early days of cinema. The rapid fire speeches gave a sense of military formality, efficiency and added a rushed importance to every line. We have the classic commander who is respectfully chided by his men and who is in full command, but also willing to listen to solid ideas from the men under him. He comes off as not knowing everything, but still being the smartest. Yes, they chose a military officer who uses common sense.The scientist is still the early clich&eacute; of wanting knowledge of the unknown and is willing to sacrifice everything - including human life to get it.  To his un-cowardly credit, he is willing to trade his own life in exchange for furthering our understanding of the universe. Of course, he does an ill-advised, morally questionable experiment that does give us our only look into the habits of the monster. In this case, the alien visitor is a humanoid beast that has apparently evolved from plant life and feeds on blood. The sled dogs are fodder and food and have little involvement with the creature besides attacking the intruder early on.This is a great movie that stands as a perfect example of our early paranoia about alien visitors and invasions. It ends with the memorable line ""Keep Watching the Skies"".The Thing 1982John Carpenter takes the basic concept and updates the science while keeping the atmosphere intact. He takes environmental factors like the cold and isolation and turns them into major plot points. He uses a research station as the backdrop and assembles regular men to go up against the threat from outer space. The monster has been turned up a few notches too. The original was a menacing brute and this version pits the humans against a shape-shifting alien that can impersonate any living organism it comes in to contact with. Assimilation after annihilation. Our paranoia over space invasions has been replaced with paranoia over who you can trust as it isn't clear who is friend and who is foe- who you can turn to and who's been turned.We still have the alien saucer under the ice as the initial point of contact, but even that idea is pushed further as the alien tries to build another ship using spare parts from around the base in order to make his escape. The original alien was pretty smart for cutting the power, but this guy is really sharp (no pun intended). The surrounding cast is composed of well crafted characters and the main protagonist is the helicopter pilot J.R MacReady played by Kurt Russel. The movie has more of a singular focus as we mostly follow MacReady and learn as he learns. Like the best of horror movies, our characters are placed in a near hopeless situation and it's only their spirit and willingness to live that keeps them going. If the original ended with the line Watch the Skies, this one should end with ""watch the man next to you"". This is one of the few times where a remake does justice to the source material.The Thing 2011The newest version is listed as a prequel and although the events of this film bring us within a few hours of the 1982 John Carpenter classic, it still feels like a modern translation since several key scenes are recreated. I'm not sure why director Matthijis van Heijningen Jr would choose to helm this movie as his first big release. It wasn't as though the 82 version was dated or The Thing represents some sort of big money franchise that needed to be restarted or reinvigorated like Star Trek.Most modern horror flicks reply on jump gags where there's a meaningless, but sudden action meant to deliver a quick jolt of fear. It's the old cat jumping out of the cupboard and unfortunately that's the engine behind this movie. It lacks the hard science and joy of discovery from the first movie and misses the `who can I trust?' paranoia of the second. There is a good attempt to recreate that tension, but it falls flat since all the characters are fairly generic. It's pretty much a few random Americans and a bunch of crazy Norwegians. When you compare this cast with stand-out characters from John Carpenter's take, you'll quickly realize why the deaths are meaningless. The writers Eric Heisserer, John W. Campbell Jr. never gave us any personalities to connect with. The main character, a Kate Lloyd played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a fine job as the one sensible character. It's obvious from the beginning that she deserves to live and everyone else deserves to die for being so stupid.The 1982 Thing did its best to show us a monster that was doing things on-screen that we had never seen before- from growing heads - to assimilating dogs- to, damn, just being gross and scary. The monster in this affair is a multi-lobster-limbed crawler and, I must admit, quite formidable. It copies the big punch-line or becoming a grotesque merging of all the victims it's absorbed, but in this case, it looks kinda silly. When you finally get the payoff of seeing a version of the monster in full light, it's a little disappointing and honestly, non-scary. Still, it does better to deliver the chills than the current crop of disposable horror-flicks Hollywood has been churning out in recent years.In the original movie, it's science verse the military when the army men want to destroy the dangerous alien and the mad scientist wants to be friends and preserve the monster at all costs. And although that was the same foolish opinion held by the upper branches of the military, it didn't seem so sinister. The 1982 film simply stands us up against a monster we don't understand and survival is the only goal. The 2011 thing brings us another dumb scientist, but you could argue that his interest also lie in a quest for personal glory. ""We May lose this find"" yes, he has a personal interest and is in it for his own immortality and legacy.The music/soundtrack borrows or pays homage to the 1982 score by Ennio Morricone. Those two ominous tones drop at the very start and at the end of the movie. It makes for a nice wrapper. Speaking of endings, 1982 left us with two characters staring at each other with complete distrust. This is an amazing stalemate and a good way to end a classic. This movie, in perfect step with the younger generation, cannot leave anything to the imagination and we get a big impact. Yeah, I must admit this is a welcome twist.Overall, I consider the 2011 The Thing to be a good movie. It's worth seeing if you're a fan of the original and the 1982 revisit. The original was a statement of our time and left a marker that exposed how we felt about first contacts. The second was a statement about the human condition and what it would take to break down the bonds that hold us together as a species. This third version details who we are in 2011 and beyond. Simply put: we are creatures that seem capable of holding on to every memory and experience while we refuse to let anything with $entimental value go. Once, we had a disposable culture, but now we have one of recycling: it's all old- fashion, phrases, influences and ideas. The big question for every revisit or re-imaging is what are you going to add? Are you going to give us useful background information? Are you going to develop a beloved character more? Are you fixing technical flaws or enhancing an experience? The problem I have with most rehashes is that the priority lies in bringing us the memorable moments while forgetting to include the WHY as far as why we chose to hang on to those moments to begin with. I think I'm going to watch the 1982 version again. Thank you John Carpenter for including the why.",3,"The Thing [from Another World] Movie Review 1951, 1982, 2011",1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,8376,"['Taken', 'Blogsite', 'reading', 'lackluster',

1506245,A39W3263A9HCMN,B00605MY0S,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[0, 3]","In this day and age of remakes, prequels and reboots, and other endless franchise padding, it only seemed inevitable that John Carpenter's The Thing, which forever became known as a cult classic after it tanked hardcore in cinemas, would get the honour. Or is it a dishonour? That certainly seems inevitable, as the reaction to the fact it is getting a prequel of sorts got a mixed reception when announced some time ago.A fan of the original film, I tend to take a disliking to prequels in general. Maybe I'm a bit biased, but I find prequels tend to ruin what you liked about a piece of work in the first place. Remember Lucas' three-part turd he dropped on us some time ago? Yeah. Let's not go there. But, if done right, a prequel can be entertaining. This year, two prequels got released that entertained me lots; X-Men First Class, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And then, this got released.The film is essentially a prequel, or so it says, to the 1982 remake of the '55 film. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World) is a brilliant, young and beautiful scientist, studying in Antartcica. The Norewigans have discovered a mysteriously unknown apparatus in the ice, and invite Mary and her team to investigate. They stumble upon a gigantic ice block with a seemingly mysterious creature inside it. Thiking they have discovered something incredible, they transport it back to base, and celebrate.However, on the night of the celebration they discover the ice is melting faster than usual, and in a rather effective jump scare, the thing escapes. Now their doom has been sealed, and death, chaos and destruction is about to happen. The terror is heightened when they realize that there is no true specimen. It has a way of letting its cells get into the people and imitating them, thus turning into the thing itself.Now, I will say that there's a lot to love about this movie, but unfortunately there's a lot to hate about it too, and it gets to the point where you're not sure if you should think it's a good movie or a bad movie.However, I could very well be blowing steam up this film's ass, but I would consider it to not be a bad movie at all. First off, the movie is well shot, and has a nice atmosphere, though it doesn't have a scratch on the first movie in terms of the two. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic, and manages to make her character in the film totally believable due to her performance. The score is excellent too, it mixes in a higher budget film sound with the creepiness of Morricone's score.In addition, the special effects are nice. Of course nothing can touch the original's practical effects that make me cringe and gag lots yet still scare the hell out of me all these years later, but the digital special effects manage to impress. Problem is, that the magic of the effects are gone in this film, I couldn't be grossed out by it at all. Instead it's just... Digital.However, there is a fair deal to hate about this film too, like I mentioned. For one, the most obvious being that this just seems too much the same as the first. There's even the obligatory ""we must have a test of some sort to see who's real"" scene that was done incredibly much better in the 1982 film. And the only reassurance that it's a prequel is the scene during the credits at the end, which, while the best part of the movie, all so simultaneously feels like an excuse for the film to say ""just in case you forgot, I'm a prequel!"". It just feels... there.Another thing about the film is that it almost completely missed the point of the original, as another reviewer on IMDb correctly put it. The thing has to be alone in the room with you for it to get ahold of your cells. This is completely urinated all over in the film, as if the writers haven't seen the original film. And this isn't helped by a big lipped alligator moment near the end, which in addition to being in a last act that tries to explain The Thing, features a scene where Kate jumps on top of the spaceship and a bizarre video/hologram thingy starts. A total nuke the fridge moment.In short, I don't know what to think about this film at all. It isn't bad, and I would watch it before the latest Michael Bay movie, indeed, but unfortunately, it seems all too obvious that this won't be one I can recommend. Not even to fans of the original, mainly because it's as if it were designed for people with low attention spans. That said, strangely enough, I would say it's worth watching at least once- that's just how polarizing the film is.OVERALL: 5/10THE GOOD: The Thing is a nicely atmospheric and shot prequel to the first movie, which features nice creepy tension and a good amount of scares.THE BAD: In addition to being a rehash, it seems like it's rather just the first movie designed for people with A.D.D. and methadone for The Thing addicts.",3,It's as if it were designed for people with low attention spans,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,4856,"['day', 'age', 'remakes', 'prequels', 'reboots', 'other',

1506250,AOKDVIEZVCRJV,B00605MY0S,Robert A. Cappelletto,"[10, 45]","Is it a prequel?  Is it sequel? Is it good story telling?  The answer to all these questions is no!  All this movie is is a forgettable pile of poo.....  Spend your money on something else; don't reward Hollywood by giving them your hard earned money -- because they certainly did not work hard on this generic mess.John Carpenter's The Thing--his 1982 Antarctic update of a 1951 B movie about an alien organism on a rampage at a remote Arctic outpost--was one of the best horror movies ever made. It was a seamless work of dread-inducing art that boasted a brooding score by Ennio Morricone, dazzlingly gruesome special makeup-FX by Rob Bottin, and star Kurt Russell, who was still basking in the year-old glow of his spot-on portrayal of antihero Snake Plissken in Carpenter's equally awesome Escape From New York.In short, The Thing was the type of rare Hollywood release that made you proud to be a horror freak.Unlike this lousy Thing.A prequel to Carpenter's cult classic by Dutch commercial director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr.--don't worry, there's no point memorizing the spelling--it opens with a trio of Norwegian researchers in the Antarctic discovering a spaceship buried in the ice, the frozen corpse of an alien being nearby. Realizing the colossal import of their find, they haul the body back to the outpost in a huge ice cube and use a drill to awkwardly extract a tissue sample. Forgetting that ice melts, they then go party. While they're dancing the Norwegian jig, their prize springs to life, resembling a gooey, spider-crab thingie with flailing octopus arms. After 100,000 years of slumber, it's understandably cranky.The alien is able to replicate human DNA and mimic bodies, so the rest of the film sees it repeatedly bursting from the flesh of folks, making screechy noises while morphing into variations of the gooey spider-crab thingie and getting toasted with flamethrowers, which causes more screeching.And that's basically it. Since Heijningen already had dibs on The Thing's hallowed name, he didn't even bother trying to conjure any of its slow-burning suspense or claustrophobic vibe, instead just blowing his creative wad on gross-out CGI effects, like the one where a vagina with teeth attacks.Of course an American audience wouldn't be trusted to maintain interest in a Norwegian-camp prequel composed entirely of Norwegians speaking subtitled Norwegian. So we have four Americans, an Englishman, a French woman, and a bunch of indistinct Norwegians, most of whom obligingly speak fluent English. One of the Americans is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a paleonthologist recruited to have a look at the Thing discovered buried in the ice. Winstead isn't a bad actress (she was a delight in Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World), and at 26 she could plausibly be a college graduate and practicing scientist herself, but the problem is she doesn't look it. Like many another actress these days, she looks far younger than her years. She doesn't get to do much science-y stuff anyway, though she does figure out that the Thing can't replicate inorganic material, so anyone without fillings in his teeth is suspect. (I'm guessing she means it can't imitate anything bioinorganic, but the producers may have feared such a word would confuse the same stupes who were assumed to need Americans in a Norwegian story.) So we get several scenes with characters yelling at each other to open their mouths.Look at the 1982 Thing again and you see a perfect thunderstorm of paranoia and suspense, brewed up by the clash of the cold front of director John Carpenter's cool-cucumber style (the camera almost never moves, and it stares objectively at the characters much as a Thing would) and the warm front of Rob Bottin's excitable-boy, sugar-fueled metamorphosis sequences, where chaos reigns. Director Matthijs van Heijningen, a fan of the Carpenter film, gets the externals but can't duplicate the authentic chill and isolation of the original.

The 2011 version of The Thing is a prequel to Carpenter's version, and 2011 Thing Director Matthijs van Heijningen (who???) pays tribute to Carpenter's work by creating the Arctic Norwegian Camp story that immediately precedes the events in Carpenter's film.Carpenter's The Thing is one of my all time favorites and has several moments that are just stuck on my brain. Who will ever forget the dog metamorphosis, the blood jumping out of the petri dish or especially ""the head-spider""? And what about the burned up, half metamorphed creature that Kurt Russell and his crew find at the Norwegian camp...well, you do indeed find out the origin of that ""Thing"" in the 2011 film and it is done brilliantly.So the 2011 film takes place in 1982 hours before the 1982 film begins. The Thing 2011 basically is somewhat of a Norwegian Camp redo of the same kinds of horrors that befell Kurt Russell's American Camp. But like I said earlier it was all very well done. The Norwegians find the spaceship and ""the escape pod"" encased in ice, they let it melt, the beast is unleashed and, voil&agrave;, it's d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again in reverse.The cast of The Thing 2011 is mostly as little known as the Director with the exception of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But they all do a great job making you feel like you're right there in the cold, Arctic camp with them in a real situation. There's tons of action & thrills and I was completely entertained from start to finish.Now if you've never seen Carpenter's 1982 version, it's completely unnecessary to see it in advance of the 2011 version. In fact my son had never seen Carpenter's, and after showing him the 1982 version after we had watched the 2011 version he asked, ""Why would I want to watch the second part of the story first?"" So if you're new to The Thing franchise go ahead and grab this film as a warm up toone of the best sic-fi horror flicks of the past 30 years. And if you're a fan of Carpenter's The Thing, but you're concerned that this movie will be a blasphemous injustice to a classic, you'd be depriving yourself of what is a very cool upfront to one of our favorite movies.",4,AND Another Thing....,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2205,"['Director', 'John', 'Carpenter', '1982', 'Thing', 'should', 'be', 'proud', '2011', 'version', 'Thing', 'prequel', 'Carpenter', 'version', '2011', 'Thing', 'Director', 'Matthijs', 'van', 'Heijningen', 'who', 'tribute', 'Carpenter', 'work', 'creating', 'Arctic', 'Norwegian', 'Camp', 'story', 'immediately', 'events', 'Carpenter', 'film.Carpenter', 'Thing', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'several', 'moments', 'are', 'just', 'stuck', 'brain', 'Who', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', 'dog', 'metamorphosis', 'blood', 'jumping', 'petri', 'dish', 'especially', 'head-spider', 'what', 'burned', 'up', 'half', 'metamorphed', 'creature', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'crew', 'find', 'Norwegian', 'camp', 'well', 'do', 'indeed', 'find', 'out', 'origin', 'Thing', '2011', 'film', 'done', '2011', 'film', 'place', '1982', 'hours', '1982', 'film', 'begins', 'Thing', '2011', 'basically', 'somewhat', 'Norwegian', 'Camp', 'redo', 'same', 'kinds', 'horrors', 'befell', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'American', 'Camp', 'said', 'earlier', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Norwegians', 'find', 'spaceship', 'escape', 'pod', 'encased', 'ice', 'let', 'melt', 'beast', 'unleashed', 'voil', 'agrave', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'over', 'again', 'reverse.The', 'cast', 'Thing', '2011', 'mostly', 'as', 'little', 'known', 'Director', 'exception', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'feel', ""'re"", 'right', 'there', 'cold', 'Arctic', 'camp', 'real', 'situation', 'tons', 'action', 'thrills', 'was', 'completely', 'entertained', 'start', 'finish.Now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Carpenter', '1982', 'version', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'see', 'advance', '2011', 'version', 'fact', 'son', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Carpenter', 'showing', '1982', 'version', 'had', 'watched', '2011', 'version', 'asked', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'second', 'part', 'story', 'first', 'So', ""'re"", 'new', 'Thing', 'franchise', 'go', 'ahead', 'grab', 'film', 'warm', 'up', 'toone', 'best', 'sic-fi', 'horror', 'flicks', 'past', '30', 'years', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Carpenter', 'Thing', ""'re"", 'concerned', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'blasphemous', 'injustice', 'classic', ""'d"", 'be', 'depriving', 'what', 'very', 'cool', 'upfront', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies']",N/A

I heard a lot of not so good things about this movie. But I was surprised that I liked this a lot more than I thought it was going to be. The main, huge thing about it that I didn't like was the cgi. There was just no need for it. The original movie was just as effective, and in parts, far more effective...but with no cgi. The acting was pretty good, but I wouldn't have cast people as recognisable as Eric Christian Olsen and Mary Winstead. The entire time, I kept getting memory flashes of other movies those two had been in; Dumb And Dumberer, Sky High, etc. That's one of the things that were so great about the original movie. They had tons of recognisable actors in it, but they were so into their parts that you forgot you were looking at Kurt Russel or Wilfred Brimley. THe best parts of the movie were the great nods to the original movie; the ax in the door, the guy with the slit throat, the ice block, the double-headed Thing, and the very end scenes during the credits. I would have loved the movie a lot more if they hadn't used cgi. I've seen worse cgi, but every time in this movie, you were aware it was cgi.All that said, this was a decent movie and, as I said, a lot better then you may have heard. It could have been a lot better, though it WAS limited in what could happen, as we saw a lot of what happened in the first movie. They did pretty well with what they had.

My favorite example is the axe found in the '82 version that this version goes on to show you just how it got there. Good stuff there.The suspense in the film is sometimes palpable, and sometimes they do the &#34;you KNOW something's going to pop out of the darkness&#34; cliche, but over all it's a decent film with some good special effects. I don't find it as &#34;amazing&#34; as the original, but it is a darn good watch.Video:1080p VC-1 encoded video. Retains the 2.40:1 ratio of the original theatrical version.The video is perfect. No noise to be found, no grain, nothing. It was filmed digitally, so this is as to be expected.I didn't notice any compression issues and the picture is, really, flawless.Audio:The audio is done in 5.1 DTS-HD MA, so it is lossless. What you heard in the cinema is what you hear at home (basically).The separation is really, really good. Dialog is clean and easily discernible. Music is properly and appropriately mixed and the sound effects are likely to be what really makes you jump. Everything sounds life life, which is a good thing.Extras:There are a few deleted scenes, some featurettes and commentaries included. I don't normally bother with the extras, but these were actually fun to watch. &#34;The Thing Evolves&#34; featurette is especially good.Overall:I'm giving the Blu Ray release itself 5 stars.

1506281,A3OWUMRVHG0VGT,B00605MY0S,The Lou,"[3, 6]","Who goes there? I mean really who digs up one of the best cult classics EVER just to do nothing with it. John Carpenters 80's The Thing was his Sistine Chapel (I'm still not the same after seeing it and that was 20 years ago). He based his version off of the original book (if you don't know it look at my first sentence) not to be confused with the 50's popcorn sci-fi flick The Thing From Another World. Carpenter also played off of the cold war paranoia going on in the 80's. It was pure raw genius. This Thing based its premise off of every other pointless sci-fi horror flick. Hot female lead Check, Lots of violence Check and a monster check. Too bad that whole plot Thing missed them.If you're going to re-make (actually a prequel) a movie then be bold and fresh about it. The Thing is neither of these which begs to question, who goes there? If it was to waste my time and make me think I could write (not to mention direct) a better movie than good show! Maybe I'm off base because after all they did get a quality script writer in Eric Heisserer (A Nightmare on Elms Street 2008 & Final Destination 5). Opps my bad I guess they didn't. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. direction was a white out void of emotion. His biggest fail was not creating that feeling that the walls were closing in on our cast.The only reason to bring the Thing to the screen again would've been to give the audience another portion of what they loved about the original. This flick failed to flesh out the everyman for himself paranoia. There were no moments that were so revolting that you simply couldn't look away. It was more jack in a box scares than a total freak show that messed with your mind. The only thing messed up about The Thing prequel was how bad they messed it up.Acting (Ambivalent): The acting wasn't horrid. It's just none of characters were really engrossing. This was mostly due to a rushed script that gave no depth to rich characters. They traded depth of a few characters for plenty of back ground characters. Most of whom lacked a pulse. Once the killing starts it turns into, oh that guy died who was he again? Plus most emotional scenes lacked a proper response from the surrounding characters. E.g. tons of serious drama is going down around me but I'll just follow orders as if it all hasn't quite registered yet. Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) the lead scientist was poorly fleshed out and came across stale. Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) played the now overdone heroine (ever since Aliens every sci-fi horror movie does this, sorry Ripley was a one of kind). Her character was forced but she gave it a go and she's eh. Carter (Joel Edgerton; terrific actor in good movies) plays the American helicopter pilot hero (R.J. MacReady wannabe; if you didn't get that then shame on you) and he's also eh.Script (Yak): Pitch, lets remake a cult classic. We'll steal the title (I would have gone with ""Who Goes There?"" But hey that's me) and recycle what we shouldn't from the original (you know flame throwers, blizzards and tough helicopter pilots). Oh yeah and were going to have badder fast moving monsters and a few inconceivable plot twists. Sigh... the problem with this pitch is that along the way they forgot what really mattered. What made the 80's Thing great was that feeling that the walls were closing in on you. That gut check moment of if we don't stop it here the whole world is done.Also Things move way too fast (this is true no matter how you take it).The best parts to the script were the very very very end and very very very beginning. Their method for testing if someone was the Thing was well thought out but that's really about it. Overall it's mostly just another sci-fi slasher without the gratuitous nudity (I'm not pro nudity but B slasher flicks at least know what they are and aren't). This Thing doesn't know what it is.My other grip is when a movie is a prequel/sequel for a universe but they totally don't fit in that universe (most notorious offender is George Lucas). The whole premise that an American team went to the Norwegian camp was lame. We didn't need an American female lead but most importantly we didn't need any Americans. Plus the Thing at times doesn't pounce on potential victims when it could. This made no sense other than to create that big plot twist moment.Special Effects (Nothing Special about Digital): Special effects in the 80's looked real (Empire, Return of the Jedi, Blade Runner, The Thing, Aliens & Terminator). I appreciate what digital effects can do but they can't do quite a lot. The Thing uses them often which really mucks up the moment by taking us out it. When a monster looks fake you stop living the scene and start to analyze how silly it looks. This NEVER happened in the original. The effects fell short because they lacked the brutal nature of actual monster props, gallons of blood and puss plus the realness of hand crafted latex creepers (When they burn they look real unlike their digital cousins).Music (where are you): Bum bump bum bump flat line. The heart beat music wasn't here until the last scene (I think the start also but it was brief). That's the best part of the music and it wasn't even used. Wow bad call in a movie full of bad calls.Fin.",2,All those little THINGS like script and direction.,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,5250,"['Who', 'there', 'mean', 'really', 'who', 'up', 'one', 'best',

It sent my date into hiding with her head turned into my shoulder for most of the film.I had always wondered if someone would produce a sequel so we could know Mac's ultimate fate. Wisely, this was never done ( although Dark Horse comics did produce a series of books as a follow up but I didn't keep up with them ). Hollywood will produce superior sequels, on occasion but, for the most part, they eff it up.As a prequel, this movie didn't work for me, at first. I saw it as too derivative. I let it go for awhile. I had occasion to watch it again, recently, and found my initial reaction a little too judgmental. There's room for legitimate comparison. However, I thought about the concept paired with the location similarities and decided, 'why would there not be a fair amount of deja-vu-ness'?The finished product can stand on its' own, I feel.My only real criticism would be with the film makers vision of the alien craft interior. The mesh of a good mech representation on the exterior vs. the claustrophobic, organic interior was a good idea, just didn't work for me somehow.But, that's it.

What this movie gives you that that movie didn't was a bit more of an explanation of the ""what"" and the ""why"" of the alien fiend, not that it matters as the film was really about paranoia regarding who we are and can we trust ourselves and others, and unfortunately it doesn't do as good or smart of a job of playing upon, developing, or sustaining the paranoid aspect.  But that's not saying that it doesn't manage these elements and include some good creature effects (I prefer the original's though as its more practical effects carried more weight than the digital effects here).The winsome Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Kate Lloyd, the heroine and brains of the picture, and she does a good job though it's not quite believable how she picked up on and understood everything so quickly.

No film before or since has scared me as much as that film (granted I was 13 when I saw it). When I heard of a film at first remaking, and then covering the events prior to this film, I was to put it mildly very skeptical to outright hostile about this film. My view was that it was a stupid idea since you know what happens if they stay true to the original film. Then slowly but surely I had heard things (pun intended) about the film. I liked the cast and not just for Mary Elizabeth Winstead. I finally decided to go and see it and I was not dissapointed. The film faithfully stays true to the era (no PCs or cell phones) and to the film(it ends as the JC film begins with a helicopter chasing a Thing dog). What happens in-between was a treat to watch. The Thing really lends itself to CGI making the creatures far more lethal then their animatronic versions in 1982. The acting is first rate as is the science of discovering who is or isn't the Thing. The tension and suspicion of the first film is with you until the final reel and they do leave the camp in the same condition so Kurt Russell can find it in 1982. The fun is how they get there and what happens to everyone.

Hoier ""thoier""","[21, 36]","Part of my job professionally is having to read through treatments written by Directors (well, I'm not entirely sure the majority of Director's actually write them themselves) for the commercial campaigns they're essentially pitching.  Almost all of them are a little over the top and they almost always say the exact same thing if you just swap whatever product or service it is they're going to try to sell us.I'm not sure if motion picture Director's have to sell their idea in a written treatment, but I wondered aloud if Vinken Von Duchsmieldt (or whatever his name is) had to write one to direct 'The Thing'.  If so, and if someone could score me a copy, I'll pay $5 for it.I paid $4 to watch 'The Thing' and I'm sure that whatever his vision was to get the job was hilarious.It's not that 'The Thing' is hilarious, but when you sit for a moment in your living room chair, alone because the wife and kids are gone to visit the in-laws, and think about what you just witnessed...you wonder how such a wonderful idea could be butchered so badly.I refuse to watch remakes of terrific movies and John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is FIVE STARS.  It's unparalleled in it's genre and still, to date, one of my five favorite movies.  When I read that this was meant to be a prequel to the 1982 film, I figured no harm-no foul.You have your mixture of Norwegians, Swedes, Latinos, Africans, and Americans all working as scientists in Antarctica.  There are a ton of camps up there for some reason, apparently...as we know there is the Pro-American Camp not too far away and find out there might even be a Russian Camp not too far away, either.  Who cares, really.We find out that the United Nations of scientists stumble upon the alien craft that spawns 'The Thing' and, of course, they fiddle-fart around with appendages and all hell breaks loose.  Now it's up to Casper Den Kompnenstov to make this a fun-filled-thrill ride for the motion picture thrill seeker.What you, your neighbors and I get is a confused mess that makes little to no sense.  It's 1982 and there are futuristic helicopters flying all over the joint.  Aircrafts crash 20 miles away from camps in subzero mountainous/rugged terrain and survivors appear at the door in three hours.  One guy leaves a room and then you don't see him until the end in a random control room (oh yeah, THAT guy...I wondered what happened to him), one guy leaves and gets violently attacked and then magically appears late A-OK (did The Thing not like him?), dogs disappear, the dogs owner reappears and randomly says, ""That's no dog!"" when the dog reappears.  There are more holes in this film than in a box of Honeycomb cereal.  It's truly astonishing.One thing that could save it some dignity is that we're currently residing in the 21st Century and we could really get some great features on The Thing.  A contemporary feel, so to speak.  Well, much like Lucas's prequels to the Star Wars Trilogy, you'll look back at Carpenter's version and realize that they just don't make 'em like they used to.  BORING, unrealistic garbage is what we get for the most part, here.  The first autopsy/examination we see offered hope, but it just turns into some sort of venus flytrap-Leviathon-upside down corpse concoction the rest of the way.  ZERO imagination, here.  I could have helped.  They had 30 years to think about it, for crying out loud.I will say that whoever the girl is who plays the lead did a good job.  She's got nothing to work with here but she's a good actress and I was happy she didn't get killed....or did she?Oh my GOD...The Thing really has me thinking now.  What am I going to do?Stay away and thank me in the morning, girlfriend.

1506294,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00605MY0S,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","So this is a prequel to a John Carpenter classic made in 1982. Or some may call it a ""remake,"" judging from the plotline. Whichever it is, comparison seems inevitable as Carpenter's version holds a special place in many fan's hearts. (The original currently scores an average of 8.2 points out of 10 on imdb.) And so many reviewers have already done great jobs, comparing two versions, so I think I will judge the film on its own merits. So how good is this sci-fi thriller?The story of ""The Thing"" (2011) unfolds pretty fast. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (who slightly looks like young Sigourney Weaver) is Dr. Kate Lloyd, an American paleontologist, who is called in by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) for a research project about a recently discovered object that had crashed-landed in the Antarctic about 100,000 years ago.""The Thing"" has a few scary moments indeed, but the film quickly becomes clich&eacute; once we learn what the ""Thing"" can do. The visual effects of the ""Thing"" is impressive, but the film shows it too early and too much. Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. (his feature debut) somehow refuses to create a claustrophobic environment that the film's ""Alien""-like scenario seems to need. Instead of that, he opts for a more action-filled storyline, especially in the film's climax, where things look confusing and even silly.The film is not terrible - at least it is not boring.

I can't complain about the CGI... we've all gotten so used to seeing grand vistas, battles stretching beyond the horizon and brutal violence in full-view... most films use some kind of CGI.  The Griggs-monster (in the chopper), was very cool, but the tentacles-and-toothsome-gaping-maw was getting pretty old toward the end.  I didn't care for the art direction for the inside of the flying saucer:  I know it's an alien culture and saucer is ergonomically designed to accommodate an alien creature, but the problem was the outside of the saucer doesn't resemble the inside.  The inside looked like that organically-inspired, curved walled interior of the Jupiter 2 in the ""Lost in Space"" remake.  All in all, though, I found the movie exciting.  The fight in the rec room served as the ""bomb-in-the-closet"" in Stephen King's ""The Stand"", eliminating a lot of characters in short order.  The art direction for the camp and costumes is excellent!  I like the way the director got around rehashing the primitive computer graphics of the 1982 version during the investigation of the cellular activity by going full CGI, showing the cells as viewed through a microscope.

The new 2011 isn't a sequel to Carpenter's classic film which was closer to John W. Campbell's original novella than the 1951 film. In fact, this film plays more like a remake of the 1951 Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks with the way the story is set up and the characters. This 2011 prequel manages to throw in a couple of surprises for fans of the 1982 film while also staying faithful to what we know from the 1982 film. The director and writer bring in a few unique twists and it is surprisingly well cast.SPOILERS:While tracking a strange signal a group of Norweigans discover an ancient buried spaceship when the ice they are traveling over collapses. Calling in an American Dr. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to help Dr. Sandor Halvorson determine what type of creature they've discovered trapped in the ice. When Halvorson insists on drilling into the cake of ice the creature is trapped in for a tissue sample against Lloyd's advice, they unleash a creature that immitates humans perfectly and is designed to survive something that the Norweigans are NOT prepared to face.END OF SPOILERS:Writer Eric Heisserer does an expert job of reverse engineering the screenplay from what we saw in Carpenter's film about the remains of the creature and the Noreweigan base. While that by itself wouldn't be enough to recommend the film writer Heisserer and director Matthijs van Heijningen, Jr. do an expert job of creating a sense of suspense (although not the feeling of impending doom and dread that Carpenter so expertly puts on display in the 1982 film)even though we know what is coming playing on the fact that the audience may have knowledge while the characters are completely in the dark.There are a couple of minor flaws in the film. One we can't help--it's the fact that we know the outcome (somewhat although the writer and director throw a few surprises into the film at the conclusion)and dramatically that Dr. Lloyd makes a huge leap of logic as to what the creature can do based on a cursorary examination of the cells and the remains of one of the attacked members of the team. While it might work for those who might have seen the 1982 film more casual fans or those who haven't seen the 1982 film will be a bit puzzled by it. Still, that's the worst of the film's sins. The other flaw is that while the casting is quite good for most of the main characters they aren't quite as memorable as those created for the 1982 film and the casting director doesn't have the opportunity to rely on the strong group of American character actors that populate the 1982 film. Still, the the producers and directors do work wonders with the cast that they have particularly Winstead who does a fine job recalling the character of Ripley from James Cameron's ""Aliens"" as she takes charge of the group.The director creates a creature that while it recalls what it is in the 1982 film is more brazen and reckless (as something inexperienced with humans might be)when it comes to attacks on members of the crew. We also get explanations as to why certain things occur in the 1982 film that are never fully explained (although they probably didn't need to be).The score by Marto Beltrani adds to the suspense of the film and, at the conclusion, uses Ennio Moricone's classic score from the 1982 film. The CGI and physical effects work very well and visually the creature appears quite unique at times but still recalling what we know of it from the 1982 film.There are certainly those who are going to be disappointed by the prequel but the writers and directors do an exceptional job with what they have to work with and, in some respects, the tone of the film recalls the relationship that exists between the films ""Alien"" and ""Aliens""; each film shared a central premise but each also goes its own way (although the director here has much less wiggle room with the story).As a straight forward horror filck the 2011 prequel ""The Thing"" is quite good and stays remarkably true to what we see in Carpenter's classic film.Recommended.",4,"Very good prequel--not as good as Carpenter's classic film-plays more like a remake of ""The Thing From Another World"" from 1951",1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,4105,"['always', 'seemed', 'more', 'story', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Thing', 'new', '2011', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'Carpenter', 'classic', 'film', 'was', 'closer', 'John', 'W.', 'Campbell', 'original', 'novella', '1951', 'film', 'fact', 'film', 'more', 'remake', '1951', 'Christian', 'Nyby/Howard', 'Hawks', 'way', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'characters', '2011', 'prequel', 'manages', 'throw', 'couple', 'surprises', 'fans', '1982', 'film', 'also', 'staying', 'faithful', 'what', 'know', '1982', 'film', 'director', 'writer', 'bring', 'few', 'unique', 'twists', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'cast.SPOILERS', 'tracking', 'strange', 'signal', 'group', 'Norweigans', 'discover', 'ancient', 'buried', 'spaceship', 'when', 'ice', 'are', 'traveling', 'collapses', 'Calling', 'American', 'Dr.', 'Kate', 'Lloyd', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'help', 'Dr.', 'Sandor', 'Halvorson', 'determine', 'what', 'type', 'creature', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'trapped', 'ice', 'When', 'Halvorson', 'drilling', 'cake', 'ice', 'creature', 'trapped', 'tissue', 'sample', 'Lloyd', 'advice', 'unleash', 'creature', 'humans', 'perfectly', 'designed', 'survive', 'something', 'Norweigans', 'are', 'NOT', 'prepared', 'face.END', 'OF', 'SPOILERS', 'Writer', 'Eric', 'Heisserer', 'expert', 'job', 'reverse', 'engineering', 'screenplay', 'what', 'saw', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'remains', 'creature', 'Noreweigan', 'base', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'enough', 'recommend', 'film', 'writer', 'Heisserer', 'director', 'Matthijs', 'van', 'Heijningen', 'Jr.', 'do', 'expert', 'job', 'creating', 'sense', 'suspense', 'not', 'feeling', 'impending', 'doom', 'dread', 'Carpenter', 'so', 'expertly', 'display', '1982', 'film', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'playing', 'fact', 'audience', 'may', 'have', 'knowledge', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'dark.There', 'are', 'couple', 'minor', 'flaws', 'film', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fact', 'know', 'outcome', 'somewhat', 'writer', 'director', 'throw', 'few', 'surprises', 'film', 'conclusion', 'dramatically', 'Dr.', 'Lloyd', 'huge', 'leap', 'logic', 'what', 'creature', 'can', 'do', 'based', 'cursorary', 'examination', 'cells', 'remains', 'one', 'attacked', 'members', 'team', 'might', 'work', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'seen', '1982', 'film', 'more', 'casual', 'fans', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '1982', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'puzzled', 'Still', 'worst', 'film', 'sins', 'other', 'flaw', 'casting', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'memorable', 'created', '1982', 'film', 'casting', 'director', ""n't"", 'have', 'opportunity', 'rely', 'strong', 'group', 'American', 'character', 'actors', 'populate', '1982', 'film', 'Still', 'producers', 'directors', 'do', 'work', 'wonders', 'cast', 'have', 'particularly', 'Winstead', 'who', 'fine', 'job', 'recalling', 'character', 'Ripley', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Aliens', 'charge', 'group.The', 'director', 'creature', 'what', '1982', 'film', 'more', 'brazen', 'reckless', 'something', 'inexperienced', 'humans', 'might', 'be', 'when', 'attacks', 'members', 'crew', 'also', 'get', 'explanations', 'why', 'certain', 'things', 'occur', '1982', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', '.The', 'score', 'Marto', 'Beltrani', 'suspense', 'film', 'conclusion', 'Ennio', 'Moricone', 'classic', 'score', '1982', 'film', 'CGI', 'physical', 'effects', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'visually', 'creature', 'quite', 'unique', 'times', 'still', 'recalling', 'what', 'know', '1982', 'are', 'certainly', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'prequel', 'writers', 'directors', 'do', 'exceptional', 'job', 'what', 'have', 'work', 'respects', 'tone', 'film', 'relationship', 'films', 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'film', 'shared', 'central', 'premise', 'also', 'own', 'way', 'director', 'here', 'much', 'less', 'wiggle', 'room', 'story', 'straight', 'forward', 'horror', '2011', 'prequel', 'Thing', 'quite', 'good', 'remarkably', 'true', 'what', 'see', 'Carpenter', 'classic', 'film.Recommended']",N/A

I will agree as with everyone else the CGI was used a bit to much.  If they had made some gore scenes without CGI showing the alien it would of added some additional fear factor.  I still at times got freaked out but there is just something about CGI which the mind can tell is fake and it detracts from the shock part of it.The movie over all was worth watching still and descently well done.  Now days they are bringing out so many bad movies that watching this was refreshing to finally be gripping my seat once again in suspense.Over all I would recommend this movie provided your not anal about every detail in a movie.,5,Good Movie,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,710,"['watched', 'original', 'Thing', 'now', 'one', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'equally', 'will', 'agree', 'everyone', 'else', 'CGI', 'was', 'used', 'bit', 'much', 'had', 'made', 'gore', 'scenes', 'CGI', 'showing', 'alien', 'would', 'added', 'additional', 'fear', 'factor', 'still', 'times', 'got', 'freaked', 'out', 'just', 'something', 'CGI', 'mind', 'can', 'tell', 'fake', 'shock', 'part', 'it.The', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'still', 'descently', 'well', 'done', 'Now', 'days', 'are', 'bringing', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'movies', 'watching', 'was', 'refreshing', 'finally', 'be', 'gripping', 'seat', 'once', 'again', 'suspense.Over', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'provided', 'not', 'anal', 'detail', 'movie']",N/A

BUT ... it is a very good shot by shot remake.  What this updated look at the world of the 1982 JC movie does is reverse engineer all the terrible-ness Kurt Russell and company discovered in the Norwegian science camp and fill in all the shape-shifting bloody blanks.  And this movie does a really good job of that.  Filling in for Kurt Russell this time around is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate, a paleontologist invited to the arctic to helped a group of (doomed) scientists explore a thing they've found in the ice.  From there, it's ""Who Goes There"" chills and suspense.  It would be easy to merely compare this movie to John Carpenter's and find it lacking.  In '82, John Carpenter's nightmare vision was fresh and awful and groundbreaking.  But this new Thing offers its own horror movie pleasures -- a chance to see what happened to the Norwegian camp ... some mechanical effects that are as good as those provided by Rob Bottin in ,82 ... and a first-rate performance by Winstead as the heroine of the piece.  All too often, horror movies rely on the idiotic to propel the plot.  That can't be said of this movie.  Everyone does what we would all probably do, and yet ... well, it's the thing, after all.  This is a fun movie experience created with obvious respect and care for what has come before it.

1506303,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00605MY0S,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[1, 2]","It's hard to criticize a movie like The Thing - the 2011 film by first-time director Matthijs van Heijningen - as it is in fact a good movie and very well done. And had John Carpenter never made his 1982 version of The Thing (which itself was a remake of the 1951 scifi/horror classic The Thing From Another World), then this would have been a great movie. But Carpenter did make his film and therein lies the problem.The problem is that, while this new film is written as a prequel to the 1982 film (and why couldn't they have come up with some slightly different name, btw?) and slavishly dedicates itself to that purpose, it does not for the most part add anything to the story. Certainly not enough to warrant an entire film being made. If you've seen the earlier film, then nothing in this prequel comes as a surprise. And if somehow you never saw the earlier film, then there's no real point to seeing it after the prequel as nothing in it will come as a surprise either. The bottom line is, this was a completely unnecessary film. The basic plot and events are exactly the same, just occurring a few days earlier in a Norwegian Antarctic base instead of an American Antarctic base. Which you would already know if you've seen the first film. Both the Carpenter film and this film are good movies and both are very well done - but we only need one of them.The plot, of course, is set in 1982, the year of the original film.  At a research base in Antarctica, a team of Norwegian scientists, headed by Dr. Sander Halversen (Ulrich Thomsen), make an astounding discovery, buried deep beneath the glacial ice. Or two discoveries, actually.  The first is an extraterrestrial spacecraft that apparently crashed on Earth over a hundred thousand years ago. And the second a body of what may have been one of the aliens from the ship, completely encased in - and preserved by - the ice.  Determined to keep the discovery a secret but needing special expertise to research the body, Halversen recruits an American paleontologist, Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to join the project. The alien, whose outlines are just vaguely discernable through the surrounding ice, is transported back to the base where the scientists begin their research by drilling a hole in the ice to secure a small tissue sample. This decision has unfortunate consequences as shortly afterwards, while most of the scientists are celebrating their discovery, the creature bursts out of its icy confinement, incredibly somehow alive in spite of having been frozen for the last hundred thousand years.  Alive, and as the scientists quickly discover, more dangerous than any of them could ever have imagined.  The `thing' as they call it, not only attacks everything it encounters, its cells have the ability to mimic living tissue:  it can become whatever it kills or infects.  And suddenly the scientists are trapped in a paranoid nightmare:  which of them are still human, and which of them have been replaced by the thing?  Which is pretty much the dilemma of the first film, and so nothing that happens will surprise anyone who's seen the original.To its credit, The Thing does deliver the goods where the creature is concerned.  The skin-crawling creepiness of its various manifestations and forms and the sheer grisliness of its attacks are on a par with what Carpenter's original provided in spades.  And Winstead's Lloyd does come up with a clever way of distinguishing who's human and who's one of the things that is completely different from the blood test that was used in the original film.  But only fans of the first film will be able to appreciate what the director and writer managed to accomplish in making this a true prequel.  When I say that this version of The Thing was slavishly devoted to making itself a prequel, I mean it.  Enormous care was taken both in the writing of the script and in the filming of the shots to reproduce in exacting detail the images of what the American team found when they went to the Norwegian base in the early part of the original. And the very end of the film - you'll have to sit through the ending credits to catch it - dovetails perfectly with the beginning scene of Carpenter's film.Without giving away any spoilers, I will note that the new film's makers did allow themselves a possible basis for another sequel (technically the Carpenter film counts as a sequel now, at least in terms of story) to this film. Whether or not it's made will probably depend on how well The Thing does at the box office.One final note - I would have to rate the Carpenter film as better than this one in two areas. The Carpenter film had a better musical score, done by the immortal Ennio Morricone.  The new score by Marco Beltrami is not bad, but Morricone's bass-thrumming score lent an edgier tenseness to the earlier film. The Carpenter film also had better dialogue, and more humor, as exemplified in the classic line ""I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.""  On the other hand, van Heijningen's film does have one very funny dirty joke, related in Norwegian with English subtitles, that's so obscene I can't relate it here but is pretty damned funny nonetheless.And one final question - why is it that Antarctic research stations in these movies all seem to be abundantly supplied with flame-throwers? It's not the sort of thing you'd thing would be standard equipment for that environment, unless the alien threat in Antarctica is a lot greater than the new media would have us believe.If you've already seen Carpenter's The Thing, then I can recommend this film as a kind of filler-in for people who want to know exactly what happened in the events prior to the Carpenter film and don't expect much else. But if by chance you haven't seen the Carpenter film, then I would highly recommend you see at least at least one of these two films; it's just that there's no pressing need to see them both.But all that said, both films will still scare the living daylights out of you and probably show up in your nightmares.",3,"A very well done prequel, but unfortunately a completely unnecessary

Cue the paranoia, bring on the claustrophobia, and start the body count: one by one, the isolated scientists get picked off in increasingly gruesome ways.Well done, of its kind, it differs from most other flicks of this sort in that the polar temperatures mean everyone stays pretty well bundled up, so we never get the usual ""vulnerability"" scene of Our Heroine in her Haynes. Also, we never get clear explanation of why this peaceful little science outpost comes so well supplied with the military goodies used against The Thing. I'm not complaining, though. Kate (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) channels Sigourney Weaver's ""babe with flamethrower"" more than adequately.

And when I heard they were ""remaking"" it, I just had to see it.Story: It turns out this film is actually not a remake, but a premake! You''ll noticed this at the end of the film, but was a premake even neccesary? The whole point was that we didn't know what was going on, we didn't need answers, that's what made the original scary. If you ask me this film is just a remake in disguise, most of the events that occurred in the film were the same as the original. The spaceship scene? Don't even get me started with how absurd that was, that was just going too far. Basically they are all stuck together in the artic and are trying to figure out who the next thing is. Personally this film to me would've been better off as a remake.Acting: The acting was great, I actually had no problem with it. And they didn't choose well known actors, they chose some fresh new meat!Special effects/CGI: This may be the worst CGI work I have ever seen in my life! It looked like something off the syfy channel. Example, in the beginning during the helicopter scene, when the guy's head split open, it looked like something off photoshop, no, worse! The original film contained anamatronic pupptery, no CGI. Now I don't have a problem with CGI, but at least make it look good. I was not scared a single bit, this was the biggest dealbreaker for me.Final word: Please do not waste your hard earned cash on this, if you want a real scary film, see the original, this film just doesn't do justice to it.",1,Waste of time,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,1618,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'original', 'thing', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'top', 'horror', 'films', 'up', 'date', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'remaking', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'it.Story', 'out', 'film', 'actually', 'not', 'remake', 'premake', 'll', 'noticed', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'premake', 'even', 'neccesary', 'whole', 'point', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'answers', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'scary', 'ask', 'film', 'just', 'remake', 'disguise', 'most', 'events', 'occurred', 'film', 'were', 'same', 'original', 'spaceship', 'scene', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'how', 'absurd', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'Basically', 'are', 'stuck', 'together', 'artic', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'next', 'thing', 'Personally', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'off', 'remake.Acting', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'actually', 'had', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'choose', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'chose', 'fresh', 'new', 'meat', 'Special', 'effects/CGI', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'CGI', 'work', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'looked', 'something', 'syfy', 'channel', 'Example', 'beginning', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'when', 'guy', 'head', 'split', 'open', 'looked', 'something', 'photoshop', 'worse', 'original', 'film', 'contained', 'anamatronic', 'pupptery', 'CGI', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'CGI', 'least', 'make', 'look', 'good', 'was', 'not', 'scared', 'single', 'bit', 'was', 'biggest', 'dealbreaker', 'me.Final', 'word', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'waste', 'hard', 'earned', 'cash', 'want', 'real', 'scary', 'film', 'see', 'original', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice']",N/A

They have also retconned the character ""Jans Bolon"" into ""Lars"". However, most of the rest of the movie does a nice job of setting up the continuity for Carpenter's The Thing. They worked in the key aspects of Carpenter's movie into the credits. Including Lars chasing Jed in the copter, which leads directly into Carpenter's film.CGI: This movie suffers some serious problems with CGI monsters. They look too cartoony to really be taken seriously. They were, in fact, used to replace practical effects that would have worked a lot better.Characters: Kate is a very weak hero. Her response to finding the bathroom painted with blood? Pull the other woman aside and casually mention it to her, but not tell anyone else. And her idea for a test?

It was difficult to tell one from the other.  Other than the lead character we never got to know them and never cared if they lived or died.  In JC's version you knew who was who even with the limited time each character had.The CGI also wasn't the greatest but the 1982 version puppets doesn't hold up well today so CGI is where we are at.  Unfortunately this movie didn't have a Lord Of The Rings type of budget to make that CGI look real.Overall it's a nice little companion piece to JC's movie.
