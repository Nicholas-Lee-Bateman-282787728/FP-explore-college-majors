645928,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JP71,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","I have used a review of ""The Best Of Leonard Cohen"" CD as the start of my review of the DVD ""Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man"" because I believe that the questions that I had about his place in musical history get resolved, partially, in the film:""The Best Of Leonard Cohen, Leonard Cohen, CBS Records, 1975Leonard Cohen always seemed to me to be the odd man out in the swirl of the folk revival of the early 1960's. Yes, sure he did his time at the Chelsea Hotel (something of a rite of passage for some singer/songwriters). He certainly, either through his music or lifestyle, did not merely represent some hippie faddism. He was just a little too old and little too proper writer, in the European sense, for that. Yet, although some of his material could well be played in the beat caf&eacute;s of the late 1950's, there too his work seems too civilized for that raucous crowd. A viewing several years ago of a film documentary on his life, work and times ""I'm Your Man"" only added to my confusion about where to pigeonhole Mr. Cohen.So now you see my dilemma. In any case the best place to start to get an appreciation for the work of this very talented and driven lyricist (I cannot say much for his vocal accomplishments as it will be the lyrics that will stand the test of time, not the voice) is this compilation of his best work, circa 1975. Haven't we all had, or wanted to have, male or female, that ""Suzanne"" of the first song. This is probably his best known song, and I think rightly so as a secondary anthem of the 1960's. Included here are the heart-wrenching lyrics of ""Bird On A Wire"", as well as ""Sisters Of Mercy"" and ""So Long, Marianne"". Cohen tips his hat to the Chelsea Hotel experience in ""Chelsea Hotel No. 2"". As I run through this list there is one thought that does occur to me. If you are in a depressed or melancholy mood it is best to save this CD for some other time. But do listen to it.""Those remarks receive some answers in this well-done 2005 part biographic sketch and part tribute concert (down in Sydney, Australia). The parts about his driven personal life from the days when he held forth in the poetry circles of his native Montreal, his evolution as a lyricist during his key stay at the Chelsea Hotel (basically absorbing the vibrant folk lyric/ poetic milieu of New York City, the center of the cultural universe back in those days), and his long time commitment to the rigors of Buddhism round his story and give a better sense of the demons that drove his work.The concert segments interspersed between the Cohen commentaries are the real reason to view this DVD though. I mentioned in the review of the CD (and Cohen, with a measured sense of his own creative skills, confirms in this film) that Leonard Cohen would be remembered for his lyrics not for his voice. By that I did not mean that his work could not be well-covered by others. And this Sydney concert is the proof. Of course any time you have the McGarrigle Sisters, Anna and Kate and the Wainwright kids (Kate's kids), Rufus and Martha (Martha outshines Rufus here, if you can believe that), you know that there is a solid base to the show. Add in Linda Thompson, Beth Orton and others covering Cohen classics like ""Suzanne"", ""Sisters Of Mercy"", and Chelsea Hotel"", to name a few, and this is quite a tribute show. Additionally, there is as segment with the ubiquitous Bono and the U2 crowd doing their part by ""aiding"" Cohen's singing on a newer song ""Tower Of Sound"" and the title entry ""I'm Your Man"". This is good stuff for Cohen aficionados and newcomers alike.",4,"Once Again, On The Enigma Of Leonard Cohen",1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,3571,"['have', 'used', 'review', 'Best', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'CD', 'start', 'review', 'DVD', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', ""'m"", 'Your', 'Man', 'believe', 'questions', 'had', 'place', 'musical', 'history', 'get', 'resolved', 'partially', 'film', 'Best', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'CBS', 'Records', '1975Leonard', 'Cohen', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'odd', 'man', 'swirl', 'folk', 'revival', 'early', '1960', 'Yes', 'sure', 'did', 'time', 'Chelsea', 'Hotel', 'something', 'rite', 'passage', 'singer/songwriters', 'certainly', 'music', 'lifestyle', 'did', 'not', 'merely', 'represent', 'hippie', 'faddism', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'little', 'too', 'proper', 'writer', 'European', 'sense', 'Yet', 'material', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'played', 'beat', 'caf', 'eacute', 's', 'late', '1950', 'too', 'work', 'too', 'civilized', 'raucous', 'crowd', 'viewing', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'documentary', 'life', 'work', 'times', ""'m"", 'Your', 'Man', 'only', 'added', 'confusion', 'where', 'pigeonhole', 'Mr.', 'Cohen.So', 'now', 'see', 'dilemma', 'case', 'best', 'place', 'start', 'get', 'appreciation', 'work', 'very', 'talented', 'driven', 'lyricist', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'vocal', 'accomplishments', 'will', 'be', 'lyrics', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'not', 'voice', 'compilation', 'best', 'work', 'circa', '1975', 'Have', ""n't"", 'had', 'wanted', 'have', 'male', 'female', 'Suzanne', 'first', 'song', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'song', 'think', 'rightly', 'so', 'secondary', 'anthem', '1960', 'Included', 'here', 'are', 'heart-wrenching', 'lyrics', 'Bird', 'A', 'Wire', 'as', 'well', 'Sisters', 'Mercy', 'So', 'Long', 'Marianne', 'Cohen', 'hat', 'Chelsea', 'Hotel', 'experience', 'Chelsea', 'Hotel', 'No', '2', 'run', 'list', 'one', 'thought', 'occur', 'are', 'depressed', 'melancholy', 'mood', 'best', 'save', 'CD', 'other', 'time', 'do', 'listen', 'remarks', 'receive', 'answers', 'well-done', '2005', 'part', 'biographic', 'sketch', 'part', 'tribute', 'concert', 'down', 'Sydney', 'Australia', 'parts', 'driven', 'personal', 'life', 'days', 'when', 'held', 'forth', 'poetry', 'circles', 'native', 'Montreal', 'evolution', 'lyricist', 'key', 'stay', 'Chelsea', 'Hotel', 'basically', 'absorbing', 'vibrant', 'folk', 'lyric/', 'poetic', 'milieu', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'center', 'cultural', 'universe', 'back', 'days', 'long', 'time', 'commitment', 'rigors', 'Buddhism', 'round', 'story', 'give', 'better', 'sense', 'demons', 'drove', 'work.The', 'concert', 'segments', 'interspersed', 'Cohen', 'commentaries', 'are', 'real', 'reason', 'view', 'DVD', 'mentioned', 'review', 'CD', 'Cohen', 'measured', 'sense', 'own', 'creative', 'skills', 'confirms', 'film', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'would', 'be', 'remembered', 'lyrics', 'not', 'voice', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'work', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'well-covered', 'others', 'Sydney', 'concert', 'proof', 'course', 'time', 'have', 'McGarrigle', 'Sisters', 'Anna', 'Kate', 'Wainwright', 'kids', 'Kate', 'kids', 'Rufus', 'Martha', 'Martha', 'Rufus', 'here', 'can', 'believe', 'know', 'solid', 'base', 'show', 'Add', 'Linda', 'Thompson', 'Beth', 'Orton', 'others', 'covering', 'Cohen', 'classics', 'Suzanne', 'Sisters', 'Mercy', 'Chelsea', 'Hotel', 'name', 'few', 'quite', 'tribute', 'show', 'Additionally', 'segment', 'ubiquitous', 'Bono', 'U2', 'crowd', 'doing', 'part', 'aiding', 'Cohen', 'singing', 'newer', 'song', 'Tower', 'Sound', 'title', 'entry', ""'m"", 'Your', 'Man', 'good', 'stuff', 'Cohen', 'aficionados', 'newcomers', 'alike']",N/A

645931,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,B00005JP71,Birdman,"[7, 12]","I have followed Leonard Cohen's work since I bought my first vinyl of THE SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN back in 1968. Over the years I have admired most of his albums and especially the live sets. I own and love three of his poetry collections and find his recent work particularly inspiring.Knowing the risks he has taken in his poetry,music and spiritual life, I was amazed that the director of this oddly irritating tribute (and the concert on which it is based) garnered such praise from the press and from viewers.To my mind, only Rufus Wainwright and Beth Orton sang Cohen's songs clearly enough and unaffectedly enough to bring their message to life. While Antony excels on an album or two, and Linda Thompson is consistently fine on her own, they seemed oddly out-of-place here And Martha Wainwright's 'very high-pitched timbre almost gave me the willies.The actual documentary footage here is bare-bones featuring some scattered childhood footage and extended coverage of Cohen's two monastic sojourns.  But the childhood footage repeats -- without apparent reason. The scattered archival footage from Cohen's New York days lacks focus. There must be more substantial archival stuff available, and one wonders why the director did not use it.The cinematography is often quite jarring, as often the camera peers between mike stands at Wainwright's face as he sings ""Hallelujah.""  Now and then, a showgirl appears, without rhyme or reason, wearing a low-cut dress against a red-background. Seemed self-conscious.The film ended as abruptly as it began. It lacked a coherent structure, and its odd narrative form was mashed by the out-of-focus, colored lights the director used for many of his segues. Why?The three stars are for Leonard Cohen, who has triumphed in most of his albums, poetry collections, earlier documentaries and more. The guy is an honest, good-humored genius who works hard for his money. And his 2003 CBS album,TEN NEW SONGS, is no less fascinating than SONGS OF LOVE AND HATE.Had the film been more thoughtfully produced (Mel Gibson was actually one of the producers) the director might not have needed the Edge and Bono to work so hard at praising Cohen. They might have told stories of their friendship instead.For those who disagree, I extend my respect. I may have missed something here, but I left the film in the same mental state as when I started. I have ultimate respect for Leonard Cohen and this disjointed film contributed little to my knowledge of his work or deepened my respect for him.Buy remastered versions of his recordings. Buy a book of his poetry, but don't waste your money on this.",4,If the filmmaker had only searched as deeply as Leonard Cohen does in his songs--,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,2626,"['have', 'followed', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'work', 'bought', 'first', 'vinyl', 'THE', 'SONGS', 'OF', 'LEONARD', 'COHEN', 'back', '1968', 'years', 'have', 'admired', 'most', 'albums', 'especially', 'live', 'sets', 'own', 'love', 'three', 'poetry', 'collections', 'find', 'recent', 'work', 'particularly', 'inspiring.Knowing', 'risks', 'taken', 'poetry', 'music', 'spiritual', 'life', 'was', 'amazed', 'director', 'oddly', 'irritating', 'tribute', 'concert', 'based', 'garnered', 'such', 'praise', 'press', 'viewers.To', 'mind', 'only', 'Rufus', 'Wainwright', 'Beth', 'Orton', 'sang', 'Cohen', 'songs', 'clearly', 'enough', 'unaffectedly', 'enough', 'bring', 'message', 'life', 'Antony', 'excels', 'album', 'two', 'Linda', 'Thompson', 'consistently', 'fine', 'own', 'seemed', 'oddly', 'out-of-place', 'here', 'Martha', 'Wainwright', 'high-pitched', 'timbre', 'almost', 'gave', 'willies.The', 'actual', 'documentary', 'footage', 'here', 'bare-bones', 'featuring', 'scattered', 'childhood', 'footage', 'extended', 'coverage', 'Cohen', 'two', 'monastic', 'sojourns', 'childhood', 'footage', 'repeats', 'apparent', 'reason', 'scattered', 'archival', 'footage', 'Cohen', 'New', 'York', 'days', 'focus', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'substantial', 'archival', 'stuff', 'available', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'it.The', 'cinematography', 'often', 'quite', 'jarring', 'often', 'camera', 'peers', 'mike', 'stands', 'Wainwright', 'face', 'Hallelujah', 'Now', 'then', 'showgirl', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'wearing', 'low-cut', 'dress', 'red-background', 'Seemed', 'self-conscious.The', 'film', 'ended', 'as', 'abruptly', 'began', 'lacked', 'coherent', 'structure', 'odd', 'narrative', 'form', 'was', 'mashed', 'out-of-focus', 'colored', 'director', 'used', 'many', 'segues', 'Why', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'who', 'triumphed', 'most', 'albums', 'poetry', 'collections', 'earlier', 'documentaries', 'more', 'guy', 'honest', 'good-humored', 'genius', 'who', 'hard', 'money', '2003', 'CBS', 'album', 'TEN', 'NEW', 'SONGS', 'less', 'fascinating', 'SONGS', 'OF', 'LOVE', 'AND', 'HATE.Had', 'film', 'been', 'more', 'thoughtfully', 'produced', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'producers', 'director', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'needed', 'Edge', 'Bono', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'praising', 'Cohen', 'might', 'have', 'told', 'stories', 'friendship', 'who', 'disagree', 'extend', 'respect', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'here', 'left', 'film', 'same', 'mental', 'state', 'when', 'started', 'have', 'ultimate', 'respect', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'disjointed', 'film', 'contributed', 'little', 'knowledge', 'work', 'deepened', 'respect', 'him.Buy', 'remastered', 'versions', 'recordings', 'Buy', 'book', 'poetry', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money']",N/A
645932,A2CZPM110DW516,B00005JP71,"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks""","[10, 12]","The great Leonard Cohen is saluted by a lineup of lesser artists in this disappointing concert film/documentary.The man himself is seen throughout in snippets from several interviews, but the bulk of the footage is devoted to live performances from Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Beth Orton, and others, not one of whom does proper justice to the Cohen songbook. It's really not their fault. Cohen's songs are so uniquely his own, too much the breath from his soul, that other singers tend to fumble badly when offering their interpretations. Imagine Barry Manilow attempting to tackle the songs of Lou Reed (or vice versa) and you'll get an idea of why Lian Lunson's film fails.The problem with this tribute is that those who aren't already smitten with Cohen's songs will likely go away from this film without really discovering why he's worthy of such an honor in the first place. Meanwhile, Cohen fans who are unimpressed by the performances here and who are not already familiar with Antony, the Handsome Family, or Wainwright aren't likely to bother exploring the work that presumably made them important enough to be issued the invite to appear. In effect, nobody wins.Only Cohen's backup singers, Julie Christensen and Perla Battala, hit the ball out of the park with a moving duet on ""Anthem."" The big finale with Cohen joined by U2 on ""Tower of Song"" might have been a highlight, but I'm at a point where I can't bear even one second of the pompous Bono or his bandmates.If you're not a Cohen fan and you're wondering what the fuss is about, skip this concert film and get a copy of 1971's ""Songs of Love and Hate"" or 1994's ""Cohen Live,"" and wait for the release of Cohen's 1988 ""Austin City Limits"" concert on DVD. If you discover that Cohen's voice is not to your taste and want to hear another artist interpret his songs, get Jennifer Warnes' magnificent ""Famous Blue Raincoat: The Songs of Leonard Cohen.""Brian W.

645934,A318OYMQJK0UYI,B00005JP71,C. Slayton,"[5, 9]","I have not even finished viewing this DVD and started this review in the heat of outrage, so this gives you some idea that I am not pleased with this presentation of Leonard Cohen's music. There is nothing more irritating than a hagiography about a songwriter which begins with and continues the ultimate error of constantly interrupting MUSIC, which is the reason we presumably find the subject interesting in the first place, with narrative about how great the art and the artist are. This is disrespectful to everyone concerned: the audience who settles down with the very first song (Nick Cave singing title song ""I'm Your Man"") and finds that they are suddenly listening to Hal Willner, a great producer, but he is not Nick Cave singing ""I'm Your Man;"" the creative artist, whose works are not being presented as he or she intended; and the performers themselves. This is especially egregious since these are not studio contrivances but live performances (although I have not finished the whole thing yet). I have performed music and anyone who has knows the wrench of disappointment when the music is being drowned out by a loud drunken party, well this is the video equivalent of that, and there is no excuse for it, since the problems of live music making are out of the performer's control, but certainly not out of the control of a director and editor who could have presented the music as performed. I expect this kind of thing with manufactured ""We are the World"" events, where the music is in no way the point of interest, but not with someone as respected as Leonard Cohen.Despite (or with some people, because of) his view of life as a turgid punishment for some unnamed sin, much of his body of work is especially amenable to performance by other artists. There are some wonderful performers here, the biggest treat for me being Linda & Teddy Thompson. But there are some dreadful performances, including a misreading by Rufus Wainwright of ""Everybody Knows"" (and these are readings in every sense, because almost none of these people seems to have bothered to learn his lyrics and they are reading them) and a seriously talent-challenged person called Antony is a real low point. Cohen does not write pop cliches, so his lyrics must be presented clearly, as Teddy Thompson does; there is little room for the typical vocal stylization that allows the listener to predict a word at the end of phrases that a performer completely obliterates through baroque cadences. Mannerisms do not work with this music but nearly every performer here is laden with them.The opinions of U2, Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright , etc and even Cohen himself are of far less value than the music which we are trying to appreciate but cannot because of the constant interruptions. Rather than interviewing the performers, whose opinions are somewhat predictable, I would have rather have heard from Ron Sexsmith, Gordon Lightfoot or Joni Mitchell on the subject of Leonard Cohen. I cannot fault this film for not having these but I can for boring us with the opinions of some of these performers, who despite their enthusiasms, are so young in the business compared to Cohen that I frankly don't care about their opinions. Taking a year to write a song is impressive to Bono, but this is not James Joyce's Ulysses we are talking about, it is still popular music, no matter how many dreary dissertations have been spawned by appreciation of Cohen's muse.I can put up with the limitations of Randy Newman, Richard Thompson and Tom Waits as singers, because of their wonderful material and musicianship. But when the material is shaped by limitations, even the best performers cannot overcome this, and Cohen as a performer (abysmal) and composer (boring, predictable progressions) has always put me off, the lyrics are occasionally so depressing that I almost never listen to him performing his own stuff. Like a previous reviewer, I too would rather hear Judy Collins or Jennifer Warnes than most of these people, but there are dozens of fairly recent tribute CDs to Cohen, such as ""Tower of Song,"" which present this material done by both old hands and some quite young ones.

From the first time I heard Cohen's music (in the soundtrack to ""McCabe And Mrs. Miller"") I experienced a strong and immediate reverence for these songs -- who else can unite heartbreaking beauty, spirituality, irreverence, nonchalance, cynicism, and despair into a coherent musical whole (well . . . maybe Beethoven).  So it was of great interest to see that Cohen's spirituality is informed by everything from his Jewish upbringing to the nuns he encountered in the streets of Montreal to his Japanese Zen master.  The interviews with Cohen himself are very worthwhile; his observations about events as important as the death of his father and as seemingly trivial as his lack of gallantry in revealing the subject of ""Chelsea Hotel"" emerge from his mouth as polished and poignant as haikus.  Some of the interpretations of my favorite Cohen songs rubbed me the wrong way; for instance, though I like Nick Cave, I found myself fast-forwarding through his performances as I just couldn't handle his almost Sinatra-ish take on the music.  I did however enjoy Rufus Wainwright and also, to my surprise, Antony's highly affected, yet strangely affecting version of ""If It Be Your Will.""  Hearing U2 collaborate with Cohen on ""Tower of Song"" was also a treat.  And, if all that were not enough of an aesthetic and spiritual feast, the film uses a number of Cohen's own drawings to excellent effect.  I had not known of his skill in this area and these spare, graceful drawings that hover somewhere between Matisse portraits and Asian Buddhas are the icing on an incredibly rich cake.",5,A revelation,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,1655,"['rate', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'concert', 'certainly', 'documentary', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'Cohen', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'McCabe', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'experienced', 'strong', 'immediate', 'reverence', 'songs', 'who', 'else', 'can', 'unite', 'heartbreaking', 'beauty', 'spirituality', 'irreverence', 'nonchalance', 'cynicism', 'despair', 'coherent', 'musical', 'whole', 'well', 'maybe', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'great', 'interest', 'see', 'Cohen', 'spirituality', 'informed', 'everything', 'Jewish', 'upbringing', 'nuns', 'encountered', 'streets', 'Montreal', 'Japanese', 'Zen', 'master', 'interviews', 'Cohen', 'are', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'observations', 'about', 'events', 'as', 'important', 'death', 'father', 'seemingly', 'trivial', 'lack', 'gallantry', 'revealing', 'subject', 'Chelsea', 'Hotel', 'emerge', 'mouth', 'polished', 'poignant', 'haikus', 'interpretations', 'favorite', 'Cohen', 'songs', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'instance', 'like', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'found', 'fast-forwarding', 'performances', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'almost', 'Sinatra-ish', 'take', 'music', 'did', 'however', 'enjoy', 'Rufus', 'Wainwright', 'also', 'surprise', 'Antony', 'highly', 'affected', 'yet', 'strangely', 'affecting', 'version', 'Be', 'Will', 'Hearing', 'U2', 'collaborate', 'Cohen', 'Tower', 'Song', 'was', 'also', 'treat', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'aesthetic', 'spiritual', 'feast', 'film', 'number', 'Cohen', 'own', 'drawings', 'excellent', 'effect', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'skill', 'area', 'spare', 'graceful', 'drawings', 'hover', 'somewhere', 'Matisse', 'portraits', 'Asian', 'Buddhas', 'are', 'icing', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'cake']",N/A

Of course, tribute projects are always dicey in any event, and the concert organizers should be commended for bringing in (by and large) a new generation of Cohen interpreters.  Nostalgia buffs like me might have secretly preferred Judy Collins, Jennifer Warnes and Buffy Sainte-Marie (whose inventiv, evocative ""God Is Alive, Magic Is Afoot"" is my own personal benchmark for originality in Cohen interpretations--mainly because it was a musical adaptation of a literary passage and not simply one of Cohen songs).  So give the filmmakers AND the concert organizers their props for their sincere attempt to bring the work of one of popular music's darkest poets to a generation that seems to like it pop even darker.And the roster of artists chosen for the tribute are all ones that I welcomed seeing in this context or ones whom have been reading good things about and was eager to hear.  For us old-timers, we have a least one classic act, namely Kate and Anna McGarrigle, whom I have always loved.  Unfortunately, it has come to light that Kate's children (with Loudon Wainwright) are the kind of arch, grating performers you just want to slap.  (And I am not someone normally given to thoughts of violence.)  Yes, they are talented--but also incredibly mannered and irritatingly full of themselves.  And they are not alone. I can't recall the last time I've seen such an artsy-fartsy assemblage of musicians.  (Although I will come to the defense of Nick Cave, who's taken a few knocks but whose take on ""Suzanne"" is, I think, pretty effective and as original as you could hope for.).The film comes alive whenever Cohen himself is onscreen.  If the other interviewees are almost too lavish in their praise, Cohen is himself almost too modest.  But he is always engaging, and in his own concert clip, in which he is accompanied by U2 (and which closes out the film), he is just riveting.  More of that would have made this effort a truly great concert film/music doc.  Several years ago, there was another Cohen tribute project, a CD called I'M YOUR FAN, which was pretty good.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[18, 23]","There are so many reasons to love all things Canadian: national health insurance for all citizens, the novelist Margaret Atwood and certainly Leonard Cohen. A group of singers got together to honor Cohen by singing his songs: Nick Cave, U2 and Bono, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, Anthony et al. Added to their performances are footage from many periods of Mr. Cohen's life, interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well. We thus have this documentary that will delight Mr. Cohen's fans.  At 72, Mr. Cohen may have lost a lot of his voice-- he opines that he never could carry a tune-- but he has lost none of his brilliant self-deprecating humor.The singers are fantastic; but why wouldn't they be with such words and lyrics?  Nick Cave sings probably Cohen's most well-known song ""Suzanne,"" introduced to the U. S. public so many years ago by Judy Collins. One wonders if the group drew straws to see who would get to sing that one. Anthony is great, of course; but the Wainwrights, both Martha (her rendition of ""The Traitor"" will put chills on your spine) and Rufus who sings ""Everybody Knows,"" ""Chelsea Hotel Number 2"" and ""Hallelujah"" are not to be missed.

Still, if you have any interest in Cohen and his music, this is unquestionably a must see.  The commentary by Bono, Rufus Wainwright and others gets a little too reverential at times for my taste.  Leonard is no saint (if for no other reason than Chelsea Hotel #2, his kiss -- and more -- and tell tale about an interlude with Janis Joplin) and his sly humor as he talks about his life peeks through again and again, leavening the endless accolades from his admirers.  There are many wonderful pictures of Cohen as a child and the film ends by repeating one of him on a tricycle.  My favorite though, and one that I think ties together all the contradictions in his life and work, is one of a ten or twelve year old Leonard neatly dressed and combed but for an unmanageable cowlick, and standing with a bouquet of flowers in front of a statue of Mary.The singers do great justice to Leonard's work, including  Rufus Wainwright in Hallelujuah and the aforementioned Chelsea Hotel (a somewhat different tune from Rufus's point of view).  But best of all for me were his sister Martha and her version of The Traitor and backup singers Perla Batalla and Julie Christensen stepping up with a glorious Anthem.  Only Nick Cave and, sadly, Anna and Kate McGarrigle are weak in the parade of spectacular voices singing spectacular songs.Toward the end of the film, Leonard muses about touring again, a prospect that, he says on camera, gets better the more he and others in the scene drink.  And then he whets our appetite for such a probably-not-to-happen tour by performing Tower of Song, dressed impeccably as his haberdasher father would have liked, and backed by U2.  How much would the tickets for Leonard touring with U2 as a backing band scalp for?

I found myself fidgeting whenever the camera focused on others. Especially the Wainwrights seemed to be all over the place, undeservedly so, IMHO; and Nick Cave was vaguely dissapointing with his Sinatra mannerisms.

Lian Lunson's 2006 documentary titled Leonard Cohen:  I'm Your Man is about the life and career of Canadian song lyricist/poet Leonard Cohen, and it helps verify to me that my lifetime fascination with Cohen is because he seems to write and sing as if he has no choice.  It is just part of who he is and what he must do.  Cohen writes songs like we would need to eat, it is id-driven; he simply needs it for sustenance.  In some ways listening to, understanding, and connecting to Cohen's words and music is as equally an aggressive impulse for me as a fan.He was inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame last night.  I gave up on the legitimacy of the Rock N' Roll Hall a Fame a while ago but they gain points for honoring Cohen, perhaps this means they finally giveTom Waitshis due?  Anyway, rather than sit through boring brown-nosing of what I see as mediocre talents like John Mellencamp and Madonna, I decided to just watchLou Reedgloat over how great Cohen is and then seeDamien Ricebelt out a nice version of Hallelujah (a song best covered by the lateJeff Buckley).  Then I opted to throw in this little documentary.  To my surprise I was in the prefect mood for it and so I decided to review it after a positive viewing experience.  The first time I saw this it seemed to drag at a snail's pace but still kept my attention, so take that for what it is and know it is my primary justification for a less than perfect rating.It is very important to note that this movie really is for Cohen fans, or at least fans of some of the artists who appear in the film singing his songs at a tribute show at the Sydney Opera House.  In fact, if you like Cohen but not some of the performers you may be frustrated because the film shows primarily covers versions of his songs.  Some of the complete performances includeNick Cavesinging the title track,Beth Ortonsinging ""Sisters of Mercy"",Rufus Wainwrightsinging various tracks, and perhaps my favorite performance, Antony Hegarty ofAntony and the Johnsonssinging ""If it Be Your Will"" with great passion.  Cohen also performs with U2 at the end of the film and several additional performances that appear on the film'ssoundtrackare available as extras on the DVD.  If none of that interests you then you might want to pass, but I happen to think Cohen is one of best song lyricists I've ever heard and this documentary really tries to focus on how he writes and what inspires him.",4,"""I was born like this, I had no choice""",1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,2506,"['something', 'about', 'Leonard', ""Cohen'smusicthat"", 'just', 'right', 'Lian', 'Lunson', '2006', 'documentary', 'titled', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', ""'m"", 'Your', 'Man', 'life', 'career', 'Canadian', 'song', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'verify', 'lifetime', 'fascination', 'Cohen', 'write', 'sing', 'choice', 'just', 'part', 'who', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'Cohen', 'songs', 'would', 'need', 'eat', 'id-driven', 'simply', 'sustenance', 'ways', 'listening', 'understanding', 'connecting', 'Cohen', 'words', 'music', 'equally', 'aggressive', 'impulse', 'fan.He', 'was', 'inducted', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'last', 'night', 'gave', 'up', 'legitimacy', 'Rock', 'N', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'while', 'ago', 'gain', 'points', 'honoring', 'Cohen', 'perhaps', 'finally', 'giveTom', 'Waitshis', 'due', 'Anyway', 'rather', 'sit', 'boring', 'brown-nosing', 'what', 'see', 'mediocre', 'talents', 'John', 'Mellencamp', 'Madonna', 'decided', 'just', 'watchLou', 'Reedgloat', 'how', 'great', 'Cohen', 'then', 'seeDamien', 'Ricebelt', 'out', 'nice', 'version', 'Hallelujah', 'song', 'best', 'covered', 'lateJeff', 'Buckley', 'Then', 'opted', 'throw', 'little', 'documentary', 'surprise', 'was', 'prefect', 'mood', 'so', 'decided', 'review', 'positive', 'viewing', 'experience', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'seemed', 'drag', 'snail', 'pace', 'still', 'kept', 'attention', 'so', 'take', 'what', 'know', 'primary', 'justification', 'less', 'perfect', 'rating.It', 'very', 'important', 'note', 'movie', 'really', 'Cohen', 'fans', 'least', 'fans', 'artists', 'who', 'appear', 'film', 'singing', 'songs', 'tribute', 'show', 'Sydney', 'Opera', 'House', 'fact', 'like', 'Cohen', 'not', 'performers', 'may', 'be', 'frustrated', 'film', 'primarily', 'covers', 'versions', 'songs', 'complete', 'performances', 'includeNick', 'Cavesinging', 'title', 'track', 'Beth', 'Ortonsinging', 'Sisters', 'Mercy', 'Rufus', 'Wainwrightsinging', 'various', 'tracks', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'performance', 'Antony', 'Hegarty', 'ofAntony', 'Johnsonssinging', 'Be', 'Will', 'great', 'passion', 'Cohen', 'also', 'U2', 'end', 'film', 'several', 'additional', 'performances', 'appear', ""film'ssoundtrackare"", 'available', 'extras', 'DVD', 'none', 'interests', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'pass', 'happen', 'think', 'Cohen', 'one', 'best', 'song', 'lyricists', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'documentary', 'really', 'focus', 'how', 'what']",N/A

As nice a job as the various tribute concert participants did (including Rufus Wrainright on several songs, such as ""Hallelujah"", which he has performed many times over the years, and quite well), when you hear the songs, all it makes me wanna do is grab the original Cohen tunes. Leonard Cohen's interviews are the real meat here, including among others his reading of an introduction he recently wrote for an old book of his that was now being translated into Mandarin for the Chinese market, but also his musings on how the ""Suzanna"" song came about, just mesmorizing. The last track is Leonard performing ""Tower of Song"" accompanied by U2, quite nice.So I saw Leonard Cohen's set at this past weekend's Coachella music festival, my first time seeing him in concert, and what a delight it was, almost an honor really. He was his humble self, several times saying ""Thank you, my friends"". No, thank YOU, Mr. Cohen.

Then, when his first LP came out my passion was cemented (if passion can be said to be ""cemented""?)...Oh well, this movie is definitely a treat if you are another diehard fan.  If not, well, maybe read the (excellent) Amazon review for a more objective viewpoint.  This won't be everyone's cup o' tea.  Leonard never tried to please everyone's taste and that's what makes him so wonderful.  Actually a friend of mine who is pretty middle-of-the-road and and had never heard of Leonard Cohen, saw the film and liked it.  So....Being closer to Cohen's age than to those of these artists, and not a follower of pop music at all, I had no knowledge of any of them going in.  I was disappointed when I realized that Lenny, himself, was not going to be the performer.  Who were these people anyway?  However, it only took a little while for me to be charmed, if not downright captivated by their performances.  I think it's a credit to the depth of Cohen's work that they touch people of such different ages to the degree that they obviously do.  I was very moved by the devotion to the work, the sheer passion, that these kids (and some older ones) showed.  Yes, some could be said to be ""wierd"" and ""over the top"" but that's what made them so good.  (If you don't care for wierd and over the top, you probably won't like Cohen anyway.)The interviews with The Man were lovely, too, although I had heard him give the same responses to other interviewers (Terri Gross on NPR for example).

Schultz,"[3, 5]","Just as Leonard Cohen's voice got deeper, more distinctive, and better with age - so this DVD tribute to him improves as it progresses.It doesn't start well. The first singer renders one of Cohen's trademark songs in the style of a sleazy Las Vegas lounge singer, a twin to Andy Kaufman's Vic Ferrari caricature on ""Taxi."" Then the next singer camps up a version of ""Everybody Knows,"" making it almost sound like something out of the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" This was so contrary to the darkly haunting spirit of Cohen's songs that I felt like abandoning the DVD. Who were these people? The only performers on it even remotely familiar to me were Cohen's two long-time female back-up singers. (The U2 band members on the DVD don't do much singing. They mainly provide rather lame commentary.)But I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did. The quirky and sometimes very unglamorous performances of the singers began to grow on me. In later songs, they shed any quality of parody and - let the light shine in. A singer named ""Antony"" delivers the most beautiful, heart-breaking version of ""If It Be Thy Will"" in the world.On the whole though, I still think Cohen himself does the best job of singing his own songs. He truly is the man with ""the golden voice.""  So it's a bit disappointing that we hear so little of him singing on this film - only in bookend embrace of the other singers.

We see him as a small boy riding his tricycle in Montreal, as a young beat poet intoning a stanza here and there... These bits of biography are revealing and humanizing.

The performances presented are interlaced with fragments of interviews with Cohen, in which he is witty and charming as usual. The information given by him in these interviews may not be new for Cohen fans (for example the fact that Chelsea Hotel 2 was written from his relationship with Janis Joplin) yet there are old pictures from his childhood/youth and extracts from his books that are shown while he is recollecting on his memories.Among the performances there are a few surprises, Nick Cave is incredible as anyone can expect; there is this guy named Antony (of whom I did not know anything about) that delivers a delightful version of `If it be your will', the feeling with which he sings makes this song one of the best performances presented. Rufus Wainwright presents a cool version of `Everybody knows' that in certain parts can sound overly produced, yet it is a nice twist from the original version, he also presents an interesting version of `Chelsea Hotel 2'There are also some performances that were left out and are included in this DVD release (when you see them you will understand why they were not included), Martha Wainwright is someone I still don't understand what is she doing in this film. The closing performance of the movie with U2 presents a very U2-esque version of `Tower of song' that could have sounded better if performed live, which is not the case.Even though many Cohen classics were left out (Who by fire, Bird on a wire, etc) this is an enjoyable film.

He comes across as modest, as not taking his achievements too seriously, and yet trying seriously to be a good writer (and being a good writer seems to matter to him more than being a performer).  The reference to his Zen training is interesting, but we want to know a little more about the troubles that sent him in that direction.  So, from the biographical point of view, there are gaps.But biography isn't really the point --this is a film whose backbone is a concert in honor of Cohen given at the Sydney Opera House.  Rufus and Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, the McGarrigles,  Antony, Jarvis Cocker, and others are involved, and they perform some of Cohen's best known songs very effectively.  Cave gives splendid accounts off ""I'm Your man"" and ""Suzanne,"" and there's a great account of ""Sisters of Mercy.""  The filmmaker can be a bit intrusive, with odd coloristic effects, and Bono and the Edge, members of U2, who don't seem to have been in Sydney, act as a kind of Greek Chorus, interspersing comments throughout on Cohen's spirituality.  That gets a wee bit tiresome, but they redeem themselves at the end when there's a film of them in New York accompanying Cohen himself in a charming and witty performance of ""Tower of Song,"" the only time we see Cohen sing in the movie (though we do hear his account of ""I'm Your Man"" as the credits are rolling).
