But the 1984 movie was even better.  And it became one of the highest rated made for TV movies in history.There are gut wrenching scenes, but the worst of them all is when the daughter (Cassie) has her leg cut off when sitting on the train tracks.  The actress (Nikki Creswell) also played (briefly)  Patrick's Swayze's sister in the first two episodes of North and South.  I haven't seen her since.  She's amazeballs in this-- but ultimately the picture rises or falls on Fonda's performance and it is a dilly!!!  Completely and totally unlike anything she's done and amazingly convincing.  When I first saw it on TV in '84 I was with a friend who had come in late. At the film's conclusion when the credits were on--my friend said--""That was Jane Fonda???  I thought it was Sally Field"".The film is a pure masterpiece.",5,Loved this made for TV movie.,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,940,"['Dollmaker', 'came', 'attention', 'early', '80s', 'when', 'friend', 'recommended', 'novel', 'read', 'about', 'two', 'days', '1984', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'became', 'one', 'highest', 'rated', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'history.There', 'are', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'scenes', 'worst', 'when', 'daughter', 'Cassie', 'leg', 'cut', 'off', 'when', 'sitting', 'train', 'tracks', 'actress', 'Nikki', 'Creswell', 'also', 'played', 'briefly', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'sister', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'North', 'South', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'amazeballs', 'ultimately', 'picture', 'Fonda', 'performance', 'dilly', 'Completely', 'totally', 'anything', 'done', 'amazingly', 'convincing', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'TV', ""'84"", 'was', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'late', 'film', 'conclusion', 'when', 'credits', 'were', 'friend', 'said', 'was', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'thought', 'was', 'Sally', 'Field', '.The', 'film', 'pure', 'masterpiece']",N/A

Jane Fonda has seldom been given credit for her acting ability, probably because too many people focused on her politics and protests during the Vietnam Era. She has a lot of talent, just like her father did, and more so than her brother, Peter. The Dollmaker should be considered a film classic, even though it's very existence is not that well known!

Her husband, a struggling Appalachian sharecropper, finds a job in the big city of Detroit in the early twentieth century. Believing he has found a better life for his family, he sends for them. They uproot themselves from their familiar rural homeland, and join him in a crowded, dehumanizing, housing development set up for factory workers.

269885,A31VGBHV1FDUM4,6301802837,S. Kelley,"[59, 59]","I believe &quot;The Dollmaker&quot; was a made for television movie years ago.  To this date, even tho it was made for television, &quot;The Dollmaker&quot; is one of my all time favorite movies.  It is most inspiring to me, especially if I am at a low point in my life's journey.In the movie we see the love and the struggles of an Appliachian Kentucky family.  The Nevel family may lack in money and materialistic &quot;things&quot; but the family is rich with tradition, family, love and faith in God.  From the outside they had little but really they had it all.We see the Gertie (Jane Fonda) and her husband, Clovis (Levon Helm), move from their beloved Appalachia Kentucky to the chaotic Detroit.  Clovis was to be called up to serve in WWII but went to Detroit where the family could be enrich by Clovis joining a union and working at a car assembly plant.Gertie finds her whole family stuck in a crackerbox of a housing development in a world far away from Appalachia.  How will she and the children adjust to Detroit?  How will Clovis make it in the union? Will the Nevels ever see their beloved Appalachia Kentucky again?It is a bittersweet struggle of survival for one woman, to beat all the odds stacked against her and her family and to follow that dream in life... &quot;HOME&quot;.  It proves one CAN go home again if they only have the dream and desire.How will Gertie accomplish it?  At what cost will it be to Gertie?One word to the wise, have a box of tissue near by as you watch the movie.I wish this movie would come out of print and more people could see it as it is most inspiring.  It leaves the viewer with the motivation that they TOO can dream and reach that dream in life!  It makes the viewer most grateful for what they have in life.I cannot recommend this movie enough.  I love this movie so much, that I bought a used copy of this video as a gift to a friend at a very high price.  It's worth every penny and I treasure my own copy of &quot;The Dollmaker&quot;.",5,A Lesson In Following One's Dreams,990921600,"05 27, 2001",2001,1993,"['believe', 'quot', 'Dollmaker', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'date', 'even', 'tho', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'quot', 'Dollmaker', 'quot', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'most', 'inspiring', 'especially', 'am', 'low', 'point', 'life', 'journey.In', 'movie', 'see', 'love', 'struggles', 'Appliachian', 'Kentucky', 'family', 'Nevel', 'family', 'may', 'lack', 'money', 'materialistic', 'quot', 'things', 'quot', 'family', 'rich', 'tradition', 'family', 'love', 'faith', 'God', 'outside', 'had', 'little', 'really', 'had', 'all.We', 'see', 'Gertie', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'husband', 'Clovis', 'Levon', 'Helm', 'move', 'beloved', 'Appalachia', 'Kentucky', 'chaotic', 'Detroit', 'Clovis', 'was', 'be', 'called', 'up', 'serve', 'WWII', 'went', 'Detroit', 'where', 'family', 'could', 'be', 'enrich', 'Clovis', 'joining', 'union', 'working', 'car', 'assembly', 'plant.Gertie', 'whole', 'family', 'stuck', 'crackerbox', 'housing', 'development', 'world', 'far', 'away', 'Appalachia', 'How', 'will', 'children', 'adjust', 'Detroit', 'How', 'will', 'Clovis', 'make', 'union', 'Will', 'Nevels', 'ever', 'see', 'beloved', 'Appalachia', 'Kentucky', 'again', 'bittersweet', 'struggle', 'survival', 'one', 'woman', 'beat', 'odds', 'stacked', 'family', 'follow', 'dream', 'life', 'quot', 'HOME', 'quot', 'one', 'CAN', 'go', 'home', 'again', 'only', 'have', 'dream', 'desire.How', 'will', 'Gertie', 'accomplish', 'what', 'cost', 'will', 'be', 'Gertie', 'One', 'word', 'wise', 'have', 'box', 'tissue', 'near', 'watch', 'movie.I', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', 'come', 'print', 'more', 'people', 'could', 'see', 'most', 'inspiring', 'viewer', 'motivation', 'TOO', 'can', 'dream', 'reach', 'dream', 'life', 'viewer', 'most', 'grateful', 'what', 'have', 'life.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'enough', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'used', 'copy', 'video', 'gift', 'friend', 'very', 'high', 'price', 'worth', 'penny', 'treasure', 'own', 'copy', 'quot', 'Dollmaker', 'quot']",N/A
