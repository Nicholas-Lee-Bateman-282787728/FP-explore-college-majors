The film is missing something -- it never ties it all  together or pushes its points through to their conclusions.Tom Grant's  conspiracy theory is refuted only from one angle, but never fully explored.  Broomfield seemed to have worked hard to get the film made, but doesn't  seem to have done enough actual reporting. Surely he could have dug up  better people to ask about K &amp; C.And as an earlier review has said,  the film can't make up its mind about what direction to go in.For those  of you seeking proof of a Courtney-headed conspiracy, it's not here,  although the documentary does make a compelling case that Courtney is  manipulative and sometimes vicious.For me, the highlight of the film  came near the end when Broomfield essentially hijacks an ACLU dinner at  which Courtney was the keynote speaker. As Broomfield begins to ask a  question of Courtney, the head of the ACLU shouts &quot;Get off the  [expletive] stage!&quot; Great irony.So, unless you're a big fan of  Broomfield, Kurt, Courtney, or the Mentors, you should rent this, but not  buy it.

507883,AVW4ZUR0324BE,B00000JRWS,"Amazon Customer ""Chris Hudson""","[13, 16]","""Kurt and Courtney"" is a fascinating documentary, even if you're not a big Nirvana fan.  Nick Broomfield has a style of just going out and interviewing people on the spot and then it seems as if the documentary just comes together on its own with this loose, unstructured feel.  It makes for interesting viewing, especially since the people that Nick digs up are very strange but incredibly interesting characters:  El Duce the drunk porn rocker, Kurt's old drug buddy, the detective, Kurt's sweet aunt (the only sane one in the whole story), and Courtney's angry father.  I also thought the two tabloid journalist guys that Nick talked to were hilarious simply because they were such losers; when they finally get their shot at interviewing Courtney, they chicken out!  Of course Courtney herself comes off as being a very tough cookie and I probably would've chickened out too.  There are a couple of interesting twists, such as the death of El Duce shortly after he is interviewed, and his hint that Allen Wrench is the one responsible.After watching this documentary I still believe that Kurt committed suicide, but I do think it is possible that there may have been some people plotting his death, and he just beat them to it.

I'm not sure if the theory is true, but Love was never charged. She is no longer much heard from, however.

Its not the best, But I give it 5 stars, merely because I like the way he goes through Seattle, and quite frankly I love Seattle, the music, etc. Nick Broomfield's deficit in the directing/filmmaking department is made up by the hilarious and interesting interviews from Courtney's head shaking father, who quite frankly passed his strong willed demeanor onto Courtney, and the fact that 85% of the people interviewed in this film seem to be under the influence of, uh substances... I recommend this, sure its quite mediocre in the way its made, but if you want to get to know Kurt or Courtney, and see how she REALLY is, rent this at your local Blockbuster. Heck, I bought the film. The music from the bands Earth and Theatre of Sheep is amazing, just amazing.

507886,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B00000JRWS,Busy Body,"[6, 9]","I am a very passionate follower of Kurt Cobain and the wonderful music he created with Nirvana from 1989 to 1994. I've researched his past in intricate detail, and I'm aware that there is a lot of stuff out there - mostly unauthorized - about him that tries to prove if Cobain was murdered or if, it was indeed, a suicide. I don't think I've ever come across anything as bad as &quot;Kurt And Courtney&quot; by Nick Broomfield though...I didn't actually buy this DVD because I'm not really into wasting money on things that I know I won't like. My friend bought this on Ebay and lent it to me. He's not really big on Nirvana. Sure, he likes &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;Heart Shaped Box,&quot; but that's about as far as it goes. I borrowed this DVD from him earlier today and went home and watched it - after about the first 10 minutes I was bored to death!Apart from having a boring and monotonous voice, Broomfield has a very unprofessional and slack way on how to approach a decent documentation of the rock icon Cobain. The film itself is very negative in its portrayal of Courtney Love, and after a while you begin to think that the entire thing is about Broomfield's grudge against her because she refused to be interviewed for this documentary. He constantly moans that she has the rights to some early material by Kurt and that it cannot be played because she won't allow it. All it does is try to steer the viewer into disliking Ms. Love. Once it's clear she won't participate, we're taken on a trip to find as many people as we possibly can - including her strange father - who will slate her, and a pointless showing of an appearance Broomfield made at some awards benefit where he gets on stage to protest about Courtney in front of a packed audience, and basically makes a bit of fool of himself! Hey, at least it's entertaining!We get many interviews with people who played extremely minor roles in the lives of both Kurt and Courtney who approach the documentary in a messed up and non-linear way. These people are basically on here to get their faces known and to glorify the fact that they were briefly involved with Kurt at some point in his life. This is exactly the kind of thing that Kurt would strongly object against if he were still with us, God rest his soul! The DVD runs for a painfully boring 92 minutes, and a lot of this time is filled by scenes of the streets that Kurt grew up in, with no commentary. The editing is poor and the language the same. Don't expect much at all, because you'll come away sorely disappointed!I'm a very big fan of Nirvana and Kurt is almost like a hero I look up to - not for his death, but because I can relate to his pain at times, so to see a DVD like this makes me angry. If you really want to see this, rent it and then forget about it because it's rubbish.

I was never much of a fan of Nirvana myself; that's probably why I liked this documentary more than most.  I was able to probably remain more objective than the actual fan.Now, I'm not saying that I bought all of the conspiracy-theory ""stuff"" here.  A lot of it is just theory, and a lot of it is probably wrong.  But it is interesting, nonetheless.  I - like so many other people - do remember hearing about Kurt Cobain's death, and at the time, it was ruled strictly as a suicide.  Even at the time I thought, ""Why would such a rich dude kill himself?"" and yes, that may sound too simplistic and naive, but I'm sure a lot of people thought the same thing.  Did Mr. Cobain really kill himself?  Well, we'll probably never know for sure, but it is surely possible that he was murdered.  There certainly were enough people that could profit off of his death.But what's really interesting about this documentary:  so many people ARE still profiting off of Mr. Cobain.  Courtney Love; Frances Bean; Ms. Love's father, who is shown in this film and I guess who has written a book or two; Mr. Cobain's aunt; even the guy who made this film.  And almost no one in this film seems to have a problem with those profits.  Personally, I find it at least problematic.  You might think more strongly about it than that on a viewing, which I do recommend.And all I've got to say to those profiteers is the following:  take advantage of your 15 minutes; they really are almost up.  Why?  Well, in five to ten years not many people will care about Nirvana's music much.  You may disagree with that, but I'll bet most teenagers today would say, ""Nirvana who?""

Instead of adopting a ruse of objectivity, he jumps head first into the middle of the action, paying off interview subjects and arguing with his financial backers over the phone while the camera is rolling. While many people scoff at such &quot;tabloid&quot; antics, I find it refreshing, considering that most major news organizations do the same thing, but are too arrogant to admit it.Broomfield's &quot;Kurt and Courtney&quot; attempts to answer the question &quot;Who killed Kurt Cobain?&quot; Broomfield more than implies that while Courtney Love may not have killed Cobain, she played a big part in &quot;driving&quot; Cobain to kill himself. Whether this is true or not, nobody will ever know.But you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist (or even a fan of Cobain or Love) to enjoy this documentary. To answer his questions about the death of Cobain, Broomfield interviews every burnout and loser (as well as a few normal people, like Cobain's aunt, who comes off as so sweet and endearing, she appears to have walked in to the wrong movie) on the West Coast, resulting in some of the most side-splitting and horrifying interviews ever caught on film. Among the subjects: an ex-boyfriend of Love's who is extremely bitter over their relationship from more than a decade before (even though he claims he isn't); El Duce (the deceased former lead singer of &quot;porn rock&quot; legends the Mentors) whose bug-eyed, drunken antics should have been captured on film more often (preferably in his own sitcom on Fox); a couple of extraordinarly inept interview terrorists (known as &quot;stalkerazzis&quot;) who appear to have even lower I.Q.'s than the average Howard Stern phony phone caller; and Love's Dad, who is even more bitter than the ex-boyfriend and has written not one, but TWO books denigrating his daughter.&quot;Kurt and Courtney&quot; is a great movie, not only about the underbelly of society, but also of the documentary process.Also highly recommended: Nick Broomfield's &quot;Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam,&quot; which is just as sleazy, scary, and funny as &quot;Kurt and Courtney.&quot;",5,Great gonzo documentary about burnouts and losers!,977702400,"12 25, 2000",2000,2169,"['Nick', 'Broomfield', 'best', 'documentarian', 'working', 'today', 'Instead', 'adopting', 'ruse', 'objectivity', 'head', 'first', 'middle', 'action', 'paying', 'off', 'interview', 'subjects', 'arguing', 'financial', 'backers', 'phone', 'camera', 'rolling', 'many', 'people', 'scoff', 'such', 'quot', 'quot', 'antics', 'find', 'refreshing', 'considering', 'most', 'major', 'news', 'organizations', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'are', 'too', 'arrogant', 'admit', 'it.Broomfield', 'quot', 'Kurt', 'Courtney', 'quot', 'attempts', 'answer', 'question', 'quot', 'Who', 'killed', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'quot', 'Broomfield', 'more', 'implies', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'killed', 'Cobain', 'played', 'big', 'part', 'quot', 'driving', 'quot', 'Cobain', 'kill', 'true', 'not', 'nobody', 'will', 'ever', 'know.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'even', 'fan', 'Cobain', 'Love', 'enjoy', 'documentary', 'answer', 'questions', 'death', 'Cobain', 'Broomfield', 'burnout', 'loser', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'normal', 'people', 'Cobain', 'aunt', 'who', 'off', 'so', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'have', 'walked', 'wrong', 'movie', 'West', 'Coast', 'resulting', 'most', 'side-splitting', 'horrifying', 'interviews', 'ever', 'caught', 'film', 'subjects', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Love', 'who', 'extremely', 'bitter', 'relationship', 'more', 'decade', 'even', ""n't"", 'El', 'Duce', 'deceased', 'former', 'lead', 'singer', 'quot', 'rock', 'quot', 'Mentors', 'bug-eyed', 'drunken', 'antics', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'film', 'more', 'often', 'preferably', 'own', 'sitcom', 'Fox', 'couple', 'extraordinarly', 'inept', 'interview', 'terrorists', 'known', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'appear', 'have', 'even', 'lower', 'I.Q', 'average', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'phony', 'phone', 'caller', 'Love', 'Dad', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'bitter', 'ex-boyfriend', 'written', 'not', 'one', 'TWO', 'books', 'denigrating', 'daughter.', 'quot', 'Kurt', 'Courtney', 'quot', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'underbelly', 'society', 'also', 'documentary', 'process.Also', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'quot', 'Heidi', 'Fleiss', 'Hollywood', 'Madam', 'quot', 'just', 'sleazy', 'scary', 'funny', 'quot', 'Kurt', 'Courtney.', 'quot']",N/A

Was it really suicide, or did someone murder him?And from this we get ""Kurt and Courtney,"" Nick Broomfield's now-legendary documentary that explores the life of Kurt Cobain, his relationship with his wife Courtney Love, and the question of whether he was murdered. There's a lot of good material floating around, but the heavy slant throws the whole film off-balance.First, Broomfield interviews many people who knew Cobain during his younger years -- his teacher, his first love, and an aunt of Cobain's. His hometown, loves, artistic leanings and rough upbringing are examined in detail. But after examining his life in Nirvana and his relationship with rocker Courtney Love, Broomfield begins examining the question: did Love kill him, or did he really commit suicide?He interviews Hank Harrison (Love's father), a PI crusading to have Cobain's case reopened, a creepy sleaze called Il Duce who claims Love tried to hire him as a hit man, a former stripper who claims to have ""proof"" of Love and Cobain's drug use, and a former nanny for Frances Bean Cobain. And as Broomfield investigates Cobain's suspicious death, he indirectly clashes with Love herself.This entire documentary is filmed in a shaky, raw manner that makes it feel like a homemade video, and most of the interviewees are seedy, creepy and occasionally disturbing. Some of them are obviously fake (the lipsticked stripper), but a few of them (the nanny, the first girlfriend, the aunt) offer some true insights into Cobain's life.But at some point, ""Kurt and Courtney"" becomes all about the Courtney conspiracy. As he investigates Love, Broomfield includes footage of his funding being yanked due to her influence, leading to him stalking her during a recording session and publicly denouncing her at the ACLU... only to get kicked off the stage. What did that accomplish, exactly?However, there's still a lot of good stuff in here -- there is some evidence in favor of the murder theory, and it's fascinating to see glimpses of Kurt's childhood (his first babyish ""song"" is adorable). And Broomfield does get some testimonies that are unique and intriguing, such as the nanny's suggestion that Love is spiritually if not legally responsible for Cobain's death.Ironically, the most fascinating part of this documentary is Kurt himself, in some brief clips from an interview near the end of his life. It's astonishing how his purity and quiet charisma shine through; he seems more alive and vibrant than anyone else.""Kurt and Courtney"" slants itself too far in one direction, possibly as revenge for Love's interference.

507894,A1OT976K86LL7I,B00000JRWS,Eric D,"[0, 0]","I'll try to keep this brief, even though I could go on and on.As a casual Nirvana fan, I've always been intrigued by the sad and untimely death of Kurt Cobain. Before watching this, I had heard about the conspiracy theory regarding his murder, supposedly plotted by Courtney. While I never fully came to my own opinion on whether it was murder or suicide, I had hoped to get some more information from this documentary. Unfortunately, the evidence proposed in this film is everything I had already heard before. So that kinda was a bummer.While there are some interesting things you can learn in this film about Kurt, in a biographical sense, there's a lot of stuff that just seems fake. I can't really explain it, but so many of the interview subjects just seemed full of crap. Maybe they were lying on their own, maybe they were being coached. Whatever it was, they seemed completely fake. Not to mention seedy. Nearly everyone appeared to be just out of their gourd. It reminded me of the 1994 VPRO interview with John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Just out there, man. Kurt's aunt and old girlfriend were the only ones that really seemed normal, truthful, and lacking any real angle.One part of the documentary that is rather amusing is the irony of the scene at the ACLU benefit ceremony. The president of the ACLU, a group whose main theme is protecting freedom of speech, does exactly what he works to prevent when he forces the documentary's director off the stage because he started asking some questions about Courtney threatening journalists. Hypocrisy at its finest.In all, the documentary never goes anywhere. There's really no main theme, thought, or idea. It's just a little journey that ends, with no resolution. Also, it's not much to look at. Visually, this documentary looks like it was filmed in the 80s, even though it was made in the mid-late 90s. I know the director had some budget problems, but wow.I guess my final statement would be this: skip it. If you're a HUGE Nirvana fan and you have absolutely nothing else to do, I guess you could give it a shot.

The director finds what he finds, and we are invited to bear witness to the whole process.  After viewing this film, we may not be convinced one way or another about the cause of Cobain's death, but we must all agree that the director gives us a fair and honest treatment of his subject.

(The episode to which I refer occurs near the end of the documentary, and managed to inspire in me a sense of outrage far greater than the death of one musician.)This documentary leaves the judgment calls to its audience, and while I could comment on my own hypotheses based on the contents of this film, in the spirit of the documentary itself I choose to leave these judgments to you.

Wallace and Halperin are far superior journalists to filmmaker Nick Broomfield and tell a better constructed story, but this movie is worth it for the interviews with Kurt's aunt, with Courtney's father, and with the eccentric alcoholic El Duce (who claims Courtney offered him cash to murder Kurt).Kurt & Courtney has a very low-budget feel throughout, and it seems as if scenes are thrown together in the order they were filmed, not in a manner to present a compelling narrative.  At one point, an essential camera battery fails and the potential for an explosive interview with Courtney is lost.  The interviewer frequently antagonized his subjects (private investigator Tom Grant and Courtney's father, among others) and lacked basic research into the backstory.  One real low point in the film is an interview of a friend of the Cobain's nanny, who reveals thirdhand ""facts"" about the case and her own interpretation of the events surrounding the death (when she was nowhere near the family).Anyone interested in the Kurt & Courtney story should watch this, just for some of the few worthwhile highlights, but this isn't high quality documentary work.

507905,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00000JRWS,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","Kurt & Courtney is the haunting documentary, about the death of Nirvana guitarist/singer/lyricist Kurt Cobain. Everyone knows the story of Kurt Cobain, but here director Nick Broomfield presents us with a different story.As everyone knows, Kurt Cobain was found in a greenhouse above the garage of his home in Seattle in April of 1994, dead of an apparent self inflicted gunshot wound. There was a high level of heroin in his system.Kurt Cobain was married to singer/actress Courtney Love and had a young daughter named Frances Bean. Before seeing this movie I had heard all sorts of conspiracy theories about the death of Kurt Cobain that all went back to the theory that he was murdered by Courtney Love. I always dismissed these because while Courtney Love does appear to me to be a little whacked out on drugs, she doesn't have the appearance of a killer. One of the things that I admired about this film is that it doesn't try to swing your view one way or the other, but instead just tries to give you the straight facts. I'm still undecided on whether I believe Cobain was murdered or not, but this movie does present some interesting facts. Broomfield has meetings with several people during the course of the film; including Courtney Love herself briefly.First he talks with Kurt's aunt Mary, who believes Kurt commited suicide and talks about the poems she found when he was a kid and some of the recordings he made. We meet a woman named Amy who claimed to know Kurt and Courtney and offers to show Broomfield pictures. Pictures that we never see...Then, in an interesting turn, there's Courtney Love's father Hank Harrison; who has written two books about the death of Kurt and believes that he was murdered, but not necessarily by Courtney. There's Private Detective Tom Grant who has gone bankrupt trying to prove that Kurt was murdered by Courtney, and who claims that someone with that high a level of heroin in their system could not have possibly manipulated a shotgun into their mouth. Problem is, Grant insists this fact even when medical experts say otherwise. In what I believe to be the most interesting turn is El Duce, a singer of an underground punk rock group called The Mentors. When Broomfield introduces us to El Duce, he's drunk and insists that Courtney offered to pay him 50 g's to whack Kurt Cobain. A few days (or weeks) laterEl Duce was found dead, hit by a train. Finally, while Courtney is at an awards show Broomfield takes the stage to ask her some questions but is quickly thrown off the stage by the president of the awards, a good friend of Courtney's. I do believe that a lot of the people in this documentary were trying to just get some fame and didn't know Cobain. But there's definitley some interesting evidence presented here. I almost forgot to mention howTom Grant actually searched the house that Kurt killed himself in with Kurt's best friend (I forget his name) and belives that the man purposefully made sure Grant didn't search the Greenhouse. This film was set to play at the Sundance Film Festival but was pulled due to pressure from Love's attorneys. Why would Love want this movie pulled so badly? As I said, I don't think everyone here is honest; but I believe at least parts of Aunt Mary,El Duce, and Hank Harrison's stories. The Nanny interview is interesting too and seems to be true. Kurt & Courtney is one of the most haunting, entertaining, and interesting documentaries in a while and anyone who has ever doubted Cobain's death or just doesn't know a whole lot about it should check it out. Whether this movie steers your opinion one way or the other, it's nice to have some facts.GRADE: A",5,Haunting and Interesting,1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,3658,"['Kurt', 'Courtney', 'haunting', 'documentary', 'death', 'Nirvana', 'guitarist/singer/lyricist', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'Everyone', 'story', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'here', 'director', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'different', 'story.As', 'everyone', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'was', 'found', 'greenhouse', 'garage', 'home', 'Seattle', 'April', '1994', 'dead', 'apparent', 'self', 'inflicted', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'was', 'high', 'level', 'heroin', 'system.Kurt', 'Cobain', 'was', 'married', 'singer/actress', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'had', 'young', 'daughter', 'named', 'Frances', 'Bean', 'seeing', 'movie', 'had', 'heard', 'sorts', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'death', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'went', 'back', 'theory', 'was', 'murdered', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'always', 'dismissed', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'appear', 'be', 'little', 'whacked', 'out', 'drugs', ""n't"", 'have', 'appearance', 'killer', 'One', 'things', 'admired', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'swing', 'view', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'instead', 'just', 'tries', 'give', 'straight', 'facts', ""'m"", 'still', 'undecided', 'believe', 'Cobain', 'was', 'murdered', 'not', 'movie', 'present', 'interesting', 'facts', 'Broomfield', 'meetings', 'several', 'people', 'course', 'film', 'including', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'briefly.First', 'Kurt', 'aunt', 'Mary', 'who', 'Kurt', 'commited', 'suicide', 'talks', 'poems', 'found', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'recordings', 'made', 'meet', 'woman', 'named', 'Amy', 'who', 'claimed', 'know', 'Kurt', 'Courtney', 'show', 'Broomfield', 'pictures', 'Pictures', 'never', 'see', 'Then', 'interesting', 'turn', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'father', 'Hank', 'Harrison', 'who', 'written', 'two', 'books', 'death', 'Kurt', 'was', 'murdered', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Courtney', 'Private', 'Detective', 'Tom', 'Grant', 'who', 'gone', 'bankrupt', 'trying', 'prove', 'Kurt', 'was', 'murdered', 'Courtney', 'who', 'someone', 'high', 'level', 'heroin', 'system', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'possibly', 'manipulated', 'shotgun', 'mouth', 'Problem', 'Grant', 'fact', 'even', 'when', 'medical', 'experts', 'say', 'otherwise', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'turn', 'El', 'Duce', 'singer', 'underground', 'punk', 'rock', 'group', 'called', 'Mentors', 'When', 'Broomfield', 'El', 'Duce', 'drunk', 'Courtney', 'offered', 'pay', '50', 'g', 'whack', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'A', 'few', 'days', 'weeks', 'laterEl', 'Duce', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'hit', 'train', 'Finally', 'Courtney', 'awards', 'show', 'Broomfield', 'stage', 'ask', 'questions', 'quickly', 'thrown', 'off', 'stage', 'president', 'awards', 'good', 'friend', 'Courtney', 'do', 'believe', 'lot', 'people', 'documentary', 'were', 'trying', 'just', 'get', 'fame', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Cobain', 'interesting', 'evidence', 'presented', 'here', 'almost', 'forgot', 'mention', 'howTom', 'Grant', 'actually', 'searched', 'house', 'Kurt', 'killed', 'Kurt', 'best', 'friend', 'forget', 'name', 'man', 'purposefully', 'made', 'sure', 'Grant', 'did', ""n't"", 'search', 'Greenhouse', 'film', 'was', 'set', 'play', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'pulled', 'due', 'pressure', 'Love', 'attorneys', 'Why', 'would', 'Love', 'want', 'movie', 'pulled', 'so', 'badly', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'everyone', 'here', 'honest', 'believe', 'least', 'parts', 'Aunt', 'Mary', 'El', 'Duce', 'Hank', 'Harrison', 'stories', 'Nanny', 'interview', 'interesting', 'too', 'be', 'true', 'Kurt', 'Courtney', 'one', 'most', 'haunting', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'documentaries', 'while', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'doubted', 'Cobain', 'death', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'whole', 'lot', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'opinion', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'nice', 'have', 'facts.GRADE']",N/A
507906,AHJ5MWFXGGQ3T,B00000JRWS,Mathias,"[1, 1]","This movie should not be watched with the intent of finding any new information on Kurt Cobain's life or any answers to the various theories around his death. For some reason, though, I recommend it as required viewing for anyone who has ever found solace in his music, if only to hear Kurt Cobain's voice as a child. This comes from the recordings of his aunt, who seems to be most decent person interviewed and provides the most insight into Cobain's early life. It is interesting see the kinds of people who were involved, such as an ex-boyfriend of Love's (who seems normal until his memories of her provoke a sudden outlash), strung out ex-scenesters who all eerily resemble Courtney Love (or rather, what she may have become), and Il Duche, a weirdly detached shock rocker who claims he was asked by Love to &quot;whack&quot; Cobain for $50,000. Love's father and a lawyer convinced that Cobain was part of a conspiracy murder are also included. It is a disturbing film, in that it is very difficult to tell who really knows from who just wants attention.It's disturbing, and it's ultimately a documentary of a failed attempt to make a documentary. And while it does not always portray Love as the villain, it certainly doesn't flatter her. Courtney Love is not exactly a candidate for sainthood, and she does seem to set herself up for a lot of her criticism, but the depictions of her given by many of those who were interviewed in this movie are truly unfair.

It isn't one of the best documentaries that I have seen but it is definitely a raw piece of work.Most of the people involved in Kurts life  that are depicted here are rather seedy and burnt out but that's part of the ""beauty"" of this film. It is an unflinching look at , not just Kurt and Courtney , but also the people who were in some way or another involved in their lives and you see them , warts and all. Although ""El Duce"" is a creep you have to wonder about his claims of Courtney paying him to kill Kurt. He could have obviously been lying and he is a creep but his responses to Nick's questions seem direct , candid and sincere. It makes you wonder.The interview with ""the nanny"" was slow but somewhat revealing. Her general belief seems to be that Coutney didn't kill Kurt but she may have drove him to suicide.And the girl , Amy ,(wearing too much lipstick) seem to be just full of bolony.The one upstanding person in this film is Kurt's aunt Mary. She is a person who you would've nevered figured to be related to Kurt Cobain. She played an audio tape of a 2 year old Kurt singing a song and referred to it as ""early Nirvana"". That was very cool.There are pictures and never before seen home footage of Kurt in this film. One home video is of Kurt arriving at a Christmas party with his girlfriend in 1987. There is an interview of Kurt talking about his new found wealth and fame and also talking about having love in his life.(no pun intended)But the footage that sticks in my mind the most is the footage of Kurt at some sort of picnic it seems sitting on the ground staring across a creek while kids play around him. A little girl picks up her doll that is laying behind him and as she picks it up Kurt just looks over his shoulder at her. The camera gradually zooms in on Kurt , freezes , then fades to black. The clip isn't sharp because it is a home video but you see this thin man with the long blond hair , dark sweater , and worn out jeans and you can quickly tell that this is Kurt Cobain ; the grunge god and symbol of a generation just looking bored like his thoughts are somewhere else. And the movie ends with a smiling picture of Kurt as a child. That final segment of the film was very sentimental to me especially knowing the fate of that smiling kid. It was sad and rather haunting.This film does lean to accusing Love of killing Kurt but there is nothing here that gives concrete evidence. The interview with Courtney and Nick getting in front of the audience and denouncing Love at the ACLU awards dinner reminds me of Michael Moorer's pursuit of Roger Smith in ""Roger & Me""; the documenter , finally , face to face with his antagonist. But ""Roger & Me"" is a far superior piece of work than this film.Get this dvd only if you are a fan of Kurt Cobain because you'll appreciate it more despite it's flaws.",3,FOR NIRVANA FANS ONLY,1001721600,"09 29, 2001",2001,2913,"['think', 'have', 'be', 'Nirvana', 'fan', 'TOTALLY', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'one', 'best', 'documentaries', 'have', 'seen', 'definitely', 'raw', 'piece', 'work.Most', 'people', 'involved', 'Kurts', 'life', 'are', 'depicted', 'here', 'are', 'rather', 'seedy', 'burnt', 'out', 'part', 'beauty', 'film', 'unflinching', 'look', 'not', 'just', 'Kurt', 'Courtney', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'way', 'involved', 'lives', 'see', 'warts', 'El', 'Duce', 'creep', 'have', 'wonder', 'claims', 'Courtney', 'paying', 'kill', 'Kurt', 'could', 'have', 'obviously', 'been', 'lying', 'creep', 'responses', 'Nick', 'questions', 'seem', 'direct', 'candid', 'sincere', 'wonder.The', 'interview', 'nanny', 'was', 'slow', 'somewhat', 'revealing', 'general', 'belief', 'be', 'Coutney', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Kurt', 'may', 'have', 'drove', 'suicide.And', 'girl', 'Amy', 'wearing', 'too', 'much', 'lipstick', 'seem', 'be', 'just', 'full', 'bolony.The', 'one', 'upstanding', 'person', 'film', 'Kurt', 'aunt', 'Mary', 'person', 'who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'nevered', 'figured', 'be', 'related', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'played', 'audio', 'tape', '2', 'year', 'old', 'Kurt', 'singing', 'song', 'referred', 'early', 'Nirvana', 'was', 'very', 'cool.There', 'are', 'pictures', 'never', 'seen', 'home', 'footage', 'Kurt', 'film', 'One', 'home', 'video', 'Kurt', 'arriving', 'Christmas', 'party', 'girlfriend', '1987', 'interview', 'Kurt', 'talking', 'new', 'found', 'wealth', 'fame', 'also', 'talking', 'having', 'love', 'life', 'pun', 'intended', 'footage', 'mind', 'most', 'footage', 'Kurt', 'sort', 'picnic', 'sitting', 'ground', 'staring', 'creek', 'kids', 'play', 'little', 'girl', 'up', 'doll', 'laying', 'up', 'Kurt', 'just', 'over', 'shoulder', 'camera', 'gradually', 'Kurt', 'then', 'black', 'clip', ""n't"", 'sharp', 'home', 'video', 'see', 'thin', 'man', 'long', 'blond', 'hair', 'dark', 'sweater', 'out', 'jeans', 'can', 'quickly', 'tell', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'grunge', 'god', 'symbol', 'generation', 'just', 'looking', 'bored', 'thoughts', 'are', 'somewhere', 'else', 'movie', 'smiling', 'picture', 'Kurt', 'child', 'final', 'segment', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'sentimental', 'especially', 'knowing', 'fate', 'smiling', 'kid', 'was', 'sad', 'rather', 'haunting.This', 'film', 'lean', 'accusing', 'Love', 'killing', 'Kurt', 'nothing', 'here', 'concrete', 'evidence', 'interview', 'Courtney', 'Nick', 'getting', 'front', 'audience', 'denouncing', 'Love', 'ACLU', 'awards', 'dinner', 'Michael', 'Moorer', 'pursuit', 'Roger', 'Smith', 'Roger', 'Me', 'documenter', 'finally', 'face', 'face', 'antagonist', 'Roger', 'Me', 'far', 'superior', 'piece', 'work', 'film.Get', 'only', 'are', 'fan', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'more', 'flaws']",N/A

He is given a short interview where El Duce breaks out laughing and offers to tell more in exchange for beer.As some credentials, I promoted several Mentors concerts in the early 90s.  I have met and have listened to many El Duce stories in person.  El Duce loves to tell perverted stories, and disgusting pranks. He appreciated our location because the liquor stores sold 64 ouncers of beer and changed his song that from ""40 Ouncer"" to 64 ouncer.  As far as being an actual dark dangerous person, the closest he came was telling story of tying dead cats by the tail to church doors before Mass.In this documentary, El Duce is presented by another interviewee as a person with a reputation of someone who would be likely to accept a contract on someone and likely/capable of doing it.I can not see anyone ever coming to El Duce to do a contract on someone.  The Mentors are all about outrageousness and humor.  I just can't see someone viewing El Duce as a killer to be hired.In the documentary, the person that lead Nick Broomfield to El Duce was someone covering his face.  At first look, I first thought this might be Dr. Heathen Scum (another member of the Mentors, for non-fans) disguising his voice.  However, on second look, the voice seemed too different than Scum's and the body type was too thin.The Mentor's website made by Dr. Scum often takes current events and humorously inserts the Mentors into currents events in fake stories.To me, it really appears to me that the Mentors pulled a huge joke on Nick Broomfield and got some free promotion in the process.Again, as a Mentors fan buying this for my interest in the Mentors, it was mildly enjoyable seeing the Mentors scam their way into a ""serious"" documentary like this.Although El Duce is pictured on the back cover of the DVD as one of 5 main characters.  The El Duce/Mentors segments maybe amount to 2 minutes of the 95 minute run time.  Nick Broomfield basically takes it with a grain of salt and moves on.  He didn't seem to have been convinced at all but I guess it was interesting to keep as part of the story.On other areas, as a non-fan of Kurt Cobaine/Courtney Love, the documentary was somewhat interesting.  Although I despised Kurt Cobaine and his music, the documentary does demonstrate him as a sincere person even being bothered by having to play the radio hits at every gig.  This documentary took my respect for Cobaine up a notch.  It now stands at notch #1.Courtney Love was shown as a total rock star pop conformist.  She stays at notch 0.Overall, this documentary seemed to lack a specific story or aspect of Kurt and Courtney to propel it and Nick Broomfield makes statements to this effect in the middle.I don't know how much I'd like this if I was a Kurt and/or Courtney fan but it seems to bounce around with no real purpose.There were some interesting parts, like interviews with Courtney's psycho father, Nick Broomfield's bold questioning of Courtney being honored at an ACLU event, but overall this wasn't very impressive, despite the few high points.",3,From the point of a MENTORS fan and Kurt and Courtney hater.,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,3279,"['bought', 'am', 'big', 'Mentors', 'fan', 'will', 'state', 'up', 'front', 'hate', 'grunge', 'am', 'definitely', 'not', 'Nirvana', 'documentary', 'El', 'Duce', 'Mentors', 'singer', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'offered', '50,000.00', 'kill', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'given', 'short', 'interview', 'where', 'El', 'Duce', 'out', 'laughing', 'offers', 'tell', 'more', 'exchange', 'beer.As', 'credentials', 'promoted', 'several', 'Mentors', 'concerts', 'early', '90s', 'have', 'met', 'have', 'listened', 'many', 'El', 'Duce', 'stories', 'person', 'El', 'Duce', 'tell', 'perverted', 'stories', 'disgusting', 'pranks', 'appreciated', 'location', 'liquor', 'stores', 'sold', '64', 'ouncers', 'beer', 'changed', 'song', '40', 'Ouncer', '64', 'ouncer', 'As', 'far', 'being', 'actual', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'person', 'closest', 'came', 'was', 'telling', 'story', 'tying', 'dead', 'cats', 'tail', 'church', 'doors', 'Mass.In', 'documentary', 'El', 'Duce', 'presented', 'interviewee', 'person', 'reputation', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'accept', 'contract', 'someone', 'likely/capable', 'doing', 'it.I', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'anyone', 'ever', 'coming', 'El', 'Duce', 'do', 'contract', 'someone', 'Mentors', 'are', 'outrageousness', 'humor', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'someone', 'viewing', 'El', 'Duce', 'killer', 'be', 'documentary', 'person', 'lead', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'El', 'Duce', 'was', 'someone', 'covering', 'face', 'first', 'look', 'first', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'Dr.', 'Heathen', 'Scum', 'member', 'Mentors', 'non-fans', 'disguising', 'voice', 'However', 'second', 'look', 'voice', 'seemed', 'too', 'different', 'Scum', 'body', 'type', 'was', 'too', 'thin.The', 'Mentor', 'website', 'made', 'Dr.', 'Scum', 'often', 'current', 'events', 'humorously', 'Mentors', 'currents', 'events', 'fake', 'stories.To', 'really', 'Mentors', 'pulled', 'huge', 'joke', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'got', 'free', 'promotion', 'process.Again', 'Mentors', 'fan', 'buying', 'interest', 'Mentors', 'was', 'mildly', 'enjoyable', 'seeing', 'Mentors', 'scam', 'way', 'serious', 'documentary', 'El', 'Duce', 'pictured', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'one', '5', 'main', 'characters', 'El', 'Duce/Mentors', 'segments', 'maybe', 'amount', '2', 'minutes', '95', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'basically', 'grain', 'salt', 'moves', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'convinced', 'guess', 'was', 'interesting', 'keep', 'part', 'story.On', 'other', 'areas', 'non-fan', 'Kurt', 'Cobaine/Courtney', 'Love', 'documentary', 'was', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'despised', 'Kurt', 'Cobaine', 'music', 'documentary', 'demonstrate', 'sincere', 'person', 'even', 'being', 'bothered', 'having', 'play', 'radio', 'hits', 'gig', 'documentary', 'took', 'respect', 'Cobaine', 'up', 'notch', 'now', 'notch', '1.Courtney', 'Love', 'was', 'shown', 'total', 'rock', 'star', 'pop', 'conformist', 'notch', '0.Overall', 'documentary', 'seemed', 'lack', 'specific', 'story', 'aspect', 'Kurt', 'Courtney', 'propel', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'statements', 'effect', 'middle.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'was', 'Kurt', 'and/or', 'Courtney', 'fan', 'bounce', 'around', 'real', 'purpose.There', 'were', 'interesting', 'parts', 'interviews', 'Courtney', 'psycho', 'father', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'bold', 'questioning', 'Courtney', 'being', 'honored', 'ACLU', 'event', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressive', 'few', 'high', 'points']",N/A

This is hard to swallow for me still, even all these years later.  The evidence presented here is rather questionable to stay the least, but it obviously will still linger.  Why?  Because we simply don't know what happened to him in those last few days.This documentary is done fairly well, as it has a very DIY quality about it.  The people interviewed are, quite honestly, not reliable, at least to me.  They are a bunch of burned out losers, rather trashy people.  But then again, Kurt was, we later realized, one of them too.  This is all about trashing Courtney.  At the time, I was (and still am) a Nirvana fan who wouldn't believe that Kurt was anything but the artist he was.  He was many things to all of us, who married Courtney, the source of all of their problems seemed to stem from her.  The documentary interviews Courtney's estranged father (who she has not spoken to in years), who has made several attempts to launch his own failed fame attempts through her.  Apples don't fall far from the tree, as it seems.  An ex boyfriend is interviewed, who accuses Courtney of attempting to achieve fame through him like she would Kurt many years later, says Courtney was just using him as well.  It's well known that Courtney was a stripper and a groupie for many bands long before she formed Hole, but she didn't want to acknowledge this as she was attempting to launch her acting career in the late 90s (see the Good Morning America interview nearly thwarted in the beginning).It's now many years later.  Courtney has since abandoned that clean image and went back to her old ways, has had her face pulled taut thanks to many plastic surgeries, and now the only media that pays much attention to her is the tabloid media and we really don't care anymore.  But, did she murder him or at least drive him to suicide?  I think I would certainly consider hurting myself as well if I had to live with her.  But, the people that are interviewed (especially that weird scumbag ""El Duche"") are not the most reliable of sources.
