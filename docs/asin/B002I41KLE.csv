It's not a classic but it is very well done and should meet (and in some cases exceed) viewers' expectations. Inevitable comparisons to John Carpenter's 'The Thing' will arise (and indeed the initial setup is similar to 'The Thing'), but hopefully people won't attack this film because of that, as that wouldn't be entirely fair. The movie plays out differently than 'The Thing' and some of the sequences are truly unnerving in their own right. There is a major 'squirm' factor that permeates the movie with the parasites really 'getting under your skin' during some of the more disturbing infestation shots. It remains sufficiently suspenseful and unpredictable all the way to the satisfying conclusion. Val Kilmer is great as the obsessed scientist but he isn't in the movie very much, however this isn't a hinderance to the movie because the rest of the cast are quite capable themselves.

1269127,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B002I41KLE,John Milton,"[0, 0]","There's something about horror films set in sub-zero conditions that just adds another dimension to movies for me: John Carpenter's The Thing, 30 Days of Night, and The Shining are all excellent examples of movies that have been greatly enhanced by the characters having to deal not only with their respective antagonists but also to contend with the adverse weather conditions and the isolation thrust upon them by the harsh climate.Having watched the trailer for The Thaw, I thought it showed some promise...Starring Val Kilmer (The Island of Dr Moreau, Heat, Twixt), Martha MacIsaac (Superbad), Kyle Schmid (A History of Violence, The Covenant, Joy Ride 2), Steph Song and Aaron Ashmore (Fear Island, The Shrine), The Thaw was filmed on location in British Columbia, Canada, the research station where proceedings largely play out is set in a suitably bleak and isolated site, adding another quandry for the visiting students to contend with along with the prehistoric bugs that have been unleashed.The special effects are largely CGI and obviously so. The practical effects, when brought in to play, were on the whole well-done and one particular scene involving a meat cleaver genuinely left me wincing. The MPAA rated this film as an `R' for ""violence, disturbing images, language and brief sexuality"" and I would say that is appropriate. Some of the scenes here are not for the faint of heart or indeed for entomophobes.With regards the acting, I'm afraid it was largely perfunctory. Divisive actor Val Kilmer is left with not very much to do in this film and I suggest he's probably been drafted in to add a bit of star pulling power to the project; a real shame since when given a chance to stretch his acting legs, he's capable of some excellent performances, such as his turn as Doc Holliday in Tombstone. MacIsaac's character turns from bratty teenager with daddy issues in the first half of the movie to some kind of brainbox paleoentomologist in the second half and this change is entirely unconvincing and somewhat annoying.For my money, the best performance came from Schmid who displayed a wide range of emotion across the film as well as being able to present as a more physical actor when required to do so.Horror movies are tremendous vehicles for conveying allegorical messages to your audience. Romero was noted for it with Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead in particular. The Thaw attempts to follow this well-worn horror trend but the environmental message behind the film is laid on thick and without any subtlety whatsoever, rendering any prospective impact it may have had impotent.At one point, I thought this film was going to play out like Eli Roth's Cabin Fever without the rampaging hormones that were at play in that movie; with some nasty body horror.

This selection showed up when I was selecting movies from a Redbox, and it promised to be fairly entertaining. The opening sequence (with the news, reporters, etc talking about a epidemic and that lady with the bug in her forehead) piques your interest and you wonder what is happening, and then the movie starts. At first it seems like your typical polar research station set up, but it quickly unfolds into something creepy.The special effects and the characters were well-done to me, with various people freaking out about infections and the like - I know I would be freaking out big-time. The only thing that really bothered me about this movie was the prolonged sex scene between Fed and his on-and-off girlfriend, it was a very, very unneccessary scene especially because it went on for like, a good ten seconds with the thrusting and all and it was not relevant to the plot. However, things get really good as the young'uns are trying to figure out what the heck is going on as the infections start to appear and Jane shows up.The ending isn't your stereotypical happy ending where the guy and the girl make out and everything's dandy, and it actually leads up into the opening scene, making for a movie that is creepily realistic. Vampires and werewolves and giant anacondas are fun, but this movie really hits home because there are already parasitic bugs in this world, and I've seen pictures and read stories of these nasty infestations.

Lewis, 2009)Here's something I'm not sure I ever thought I'd see: a movie that shows up on the Chiller network that I hadn't heard about before the Chiller network started advertising it that actually doesn't suck. Don't get me wrong, it's a fur piece from great, but considering this is the station that brought us such unbearable crap as Zombie Town, this isn't a step in the right direction, it's a quantum leap.In any case, the plot: there's a bunch of scientists and their helpers hanging out in the Arctic Circle headed up by Dr. Kruipen (Val Kilmer), a noted climate scientist and former crazy activist. He's up there with his assistant Jane (Anne Marie DeLuise, recently of the Black Christmas remake), their handyman Ed (Horsemen's John Callender), and their native guide-type person Nuti (Sleep Murder's Lamech Kadloo). They're in the midst of tracking a polar bear when they stumble upon a woolly mammoth encased in ice. Fast-forward two months and three university students are chosen to go up to the site and help them out with their research. They are Atom Galen (Smallville's Aaron Ashmore), Federico Fulce (A History of Violence's Kyle Schmid), and Ling Chen (Dim Sum Funeral's Steph Song, the Sexiest Woman in the World, according to FHM a few years back). There's some history between Fulce and Chen, but we don't know quite what until later in the movie. Also coming with them is Evelyn (Superbad's Martha MacIsaac), Kruipen's daughter, who was expressly warned to stay away but has a thing for not listening to her dad, and the helicopter pilot taking them out to the site, Bart (Hot Tub Time Machine's Viv Leacock).First off: you will hear, in other reviews, all sorts of silliness about how, for a film that's supposed to be set above the Arctic Circle, there's very little snow and no one's breath plumes. That can't be realistic, right? Well, the movie was shot on location. You tell me, bub. Then there's Val Kilmer's performance. Which was bad, true, but compared to some of his other recent flicks (Moscow Zero, Alexander, MacGruber) it wasn't all that awful. What happened to the Val Kilmer who made Real Genius and Tombstone (and was great as recently as Wonderland)? I don't know, but you won't find him in any Val Kilmer movies from the past six years. And okay, William B. Davis is in the movie for about ten seconds. I'll give you that one. And the movie has set off all kinds of crazed global warming fanatics on both sides of the fence, which is irritating. So if I were you I'd ignore the global warming stuff, which isn't nearly as heavy-handed as one would expect given the debates that have been raging since the movie was released, and just take it as a bad horror flick. In which case, it's fun, the acting is at least average, and it has actual, honest-to-god bugs, or CGI good enough that I couldn't tell the difference (as opposed to every Sci-Fi Channel killer-bug movie from the past five years). Sure, there are plot holes and general low-buget horror-movie silliness. If you're expecting a Michael Bay movie, go elsehwere.

1269145,A1F6Q5Q0U6MS5X,B002I41KLE,Tim F. Martin,"[1, 1]","I was I have to admit a little doubtful at first about _The Thaw_. I knew it was a straight to DVD release and I worried that it would have bad acting, awful dialogue, or just otherwise low production values, perhaps like some of the other bad straight to DVD releases out there or some of the worst of the SyFy movies of the week (especially how they used to be a few years ago before they started improving in quality).The movie was a lot better than I thought it would be. In fact, I really liked it. Though the overall plot was not extraordinarily new it boasted one of my favorite go-to genre plots; the isolated Arctic/Antarctic research station having to contend with some horror that they can't get help (or help fast enough) from the outside world, a plotline used successfully in the _The Thing_, the _X-Files_ episode _Ice_ and in the mystery film _Whiteout_. This time though with a nod towards global warming has as its location a Canadian island in the high Arctic, a place that is shown largely snow and ice free, just open tundra with a nearly melted glacier.In fact, the movie has more than a nod towards global warming as it is a central theme of the movie. The opening montage shows news footage of global warming related disasters and talking heads on news shows arguing vociferously for or against global warming. I first feared that the film would be preachy (really, a preachy horror movie?) or that the horror would either outright gleefully mock climate change fears or embrace them wholeheartedly with a joy-killing earnestness. Thankfully, the movie did neither.The movie opened with a team lead by an environmental scientist played by Val Kilmer. Up there to study the effects of climate change on polar bears (they appear to have used a real polar bear in the filming, one in the wild as far as I could tell, impressive) they come across something. One of the native guides finds just barely covered in the ice of a melting glacier a thawing carcass of a very well preserved woolly mammoth, one so well preserved that the polar bear had been feeding on it.Early on there is something ominous though; the polar bear, which they had shot with a tranquiller gun so that they could study it, unexpectedly died off camera. This is a shock to the researchers. What is going on?No answers yet as we go to the United States to meet the rest of the cast, the chief scientist's estranged daughter and three graduate students , all of whom are to join the professor at his research camp (one of the students is played by Aaron Ashmore of _Smallville_ fame, a good actor and much appreciated).  Taking them to the research station is a bush helicopter pilot, a good man and a strong character in this film.Cutting back to the research station, or rather, the field station camp near the mammoth find, things are clearly not well. The researchers are sick, possibly dying, and Val Kilmer's character, looks defeated, depressed and is obviously making some sort of video diary that has the feel of a last will and testament. He warns the helicopter pilot to not bring his daughter up there (though crucially, and deliberately, says nothing of the students). What is going on?I don't think I am giving too much away to say that the threat is some sort of insect-like creature, a parasite, one that had infested the woolly mammoth and now (presumably thanks to global warming) was free, active, and  now making the research team sick. The insects are creepy, the effects they have on people chilling, and there was some really good tension and thrills regarding their threat (and key to the sub-genre of genre films, half the action is the growing paranoia, hysteria, and frustration of people in a very isolated part of the world, far from help, in a life or death situation against something truly unknown and deeply chilling, in a situation where the worst can come out in people and everyone fears everyone else). There however is more than meets the eye at first, truly muddying the waters and making any charge that this is a pro-environmentalist film a difficult one to make in my opinion.The cinematography is beautiful. I must confess I have not watched the making of special feature but clearly they were somewhere, not on a soundstage (except maybe while inside the station itself) and were somewhere doing great location shooting. If they weren't in the Canadian Arctic they found a good place to represent it. They also had real helicopters and the CGI was quite good.  There was action but nothing I thought too unrealistic, nothing that I thought the characters wouldn't try or couldn't achieve given their backgrounds.All in all a surprisingly good movie. My only complaint was that Val Kilmer seemed little used and tired at first, almost not wanting to be there, an opinion I revised when I saw the entire film, that the amount of time he was used and how he acted very much fit his character's mental state and served the overall plot of the film well. There were some gross scenes but I have seen much, much worse and what was shown I think was necessary to advance the plot and show the very real risk faced by the students and others in the film.",4,Surprisingly good horror movie of the isolated-polar research station sub-genre,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,5181,"['was', 'have', 'admit', 'little', 'doubtful', 'first', '_The', 'Thaw_',

The mammoths we find, for example, show us exactly what the past might have looked like, just as the bodies of people have done for us in the past. Still, there have to be things that would be better off lef to the snowdrifts, and what if one of hose were dug up and found? Could we close Pandora's box before it closed the worldwide chapter on this thing we call humanity? This seems to be the paradox that we might one day be faced with as we take pick and shovel to the snow, not really thinking about something nightmarish that could have been left behind.As far as movies go, this is nothing new. It involves an outbreak in an isolated community, people trying to cope with the impact on themselves and on the world around hem, and just what they are willing to give up in order to stay alive. The problem the movie has is the fact that some of it is unbelievable and that it has been done over and over: the part that is hard to comprehend is the rate at which the ""thing"" spreads from person to person, and the overdone part is something that is bothersome because it shows just how much movies rely on plot recycling. Add to this some bad acting, some deaths that are horrible but that should have numbered in the ""everyone"" category (really, if you look at the station the people were in, you can see how easily it would be for something like this to get out and get everyone), and how the entire area that the dig as in would be considered a death zone. This sort of gets left on the backburner and leaves major holes in the story, but the movie is a B-movie in disguise and is hard to blame for these mistakes.If you want to see some snow and some out breaking little legs that follow, then this could be something you might like. I personally enjoyed it but was surprised by the B-movie nature of it considering how it was billed, and this led to a little disappointment on my part. I know that expectation plays a role in this as well, but I'm not sure if hat is my fault or if it is the fault of the way the movie was presented to its audience. So, if expect nothing in the beginning and watch the movie, you might find it entertaining. I did on the second go in the middle of the night, but that was after I shrugged off the first screening and knew what I was getting into. I can't say I recommend it with good conscience to anyone but those who enjoy B-movie terrors, so know what you are getting into before watching the film.",3,Digging in the sandbox of time,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,2512,"['Digging', 'up', 'things', 'artic', 'sometimes', 'yields', 'unexpected', 'results', 'mammoths', 'find', 'example', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'past', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'just', 'bodies', 'people', 'have', 'done', 'past', 'Still', 'have', 'be', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'lef', 'snowdrifts', 'what', 'one', 'hose', 'were', 'dug', 'up', 'found', 'Could', 'close', 'Pandora', 'box', 'closed', 'worldwide', 'chapter', 'thing', 'call', 'humanity', 'be', 'paradox', 'might', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'faced', 'take', 'pick', 'shovel', 'snow', 'not', 'really', 'thinking', 'something', 'nightmarish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'behind.As', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'nothing', 'new', 'outbreak', 'isolated', 'community', 'people', 'trying', 'cope', 'impact', 'world', 'hem', 'just', 'what', 'are', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'order', 'stay', 'alive', 'problem', 'movie', 'fact', 'unbelievable', 'been', 'done', 'part', 'hard', 'comprehend', 'rate', 'thing', 'spreads', 'person', 'person', 'overdone', 'part', 'something', 'bothersome', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'movies', 'rely', 'plot', 'recycling', 'Add', 'bad', 'acting', 'deaths', 'are', 'horrible', 'should', 'have', 'numbered', 'everyone', 'category', 'really', 'look', 'station', 'people', 'were', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'easily', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'get', 'out', 'get', 'everyone', 'how', 'entire', 'area', 'dig', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'death', 'zone', 'sort', 'left', 'backburner', 'major', 'holes', 'story', 'movie', 'B-movie', 'disguise', 'hard', 'blame', 'mistakes.If', 'want', 'see', 'snow', 'out', 'breaking', 'little', 'legs', 'follow', 'then', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'might', 'like', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'surprised', 'B-movie', 'nature', 'considering', 'how', 'was', 'billed', 'led', 'little', 'disappointment', 'part', 'know', 'expectation', 'role', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'hat', 'fault', 'fault', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'presented', 'audience', 'So', 'expect', 'nothing', 'beginning', 'watch', 'movie', 'might', 'find', 'entertaining', 'did', 'second', 'go', 'middle', 'night', 'was', 'shrugged', 'off', 'first', 'screening', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'recommend', 'good', 'conscience', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoy', 'B-movie', 'terrors', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'watching', 'film']",The Thaw
1269147,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002I41KLE,trebe,"[0, 0]","Part of the Ghost House Underground series, The Thaw (2009) has an interesting if unoriginal premise that has some potential, but entrusted to youth, it sinks into an ocean of Babel where that potential isn't realized particularly well.  The film bears some obvious similarities to John Carpenter's The Thing (1981), as a group of scientists led by  Dr. David Kruipen (Val Kilmer) discovers an ancient parasite, in the remains of a frozen wooly mammoth embedded in an Alaskan glacier.  While the special effects are passable, unfortunately with college kids in control, reason and intelligence are in very short supply.  Spoilers follow, so you have been warned.A polar bear infected from eating the mammoth, is captured by Dr. Krupien's team.  The bear soon dies at the group's basestation, and parasitic worms from the animal infect members of the team, who become sick and begin to die.  Kruipen tries to prevent his daughter Evelyn (Martha MacIssac) from joining a group of college students scheduled to arrive at the camp, but she boards a helicopter and lands with pilot Bart (Liv Leacock), and students Federico (Kyle Schmidt),  Ling (Steph Song), and Atom (Aaron Ashmore).  Krupien's group has set up a camp near the mammoth, so the students are on their own at the basestation, and before long, some of them are infected.  Fearing for her life, Jane (Anne Marie DeLuise), an infected member of Krupien's team, shoots Krupien.  She flees, and arrives back at the basestation, but dies after warning the group not to let the parasites spread.  Soon, the worms are on the loose inside the station, threatening the survivors who begin to turn on each other.By featuring Evelyn (whose age isn't specified, but she often looks and acts like she is about 16), and a bunch of college students, as the main characters, the filmmakers apparently were not interested in appealing to an adult audience (somewhat odd, for an R rated science fiction thriller).  Dumbed down by the writing and some atrociously irritating dialog, the characters spend almost all their time arguing about what to do, and asking each other stupid questions about where they are going, and what are they doing.  The credit/blame appears to be squarely on director and co-writer Mark A. Lewis.  Most of his characters are so irritating and inept, that they distract from the story he is trying to tell.Bart the pilot, seems intelligent, and you might expect that he would be an authority figure, but surprisingly he displays almost no leadership at all.  Dr. Krupien isn't around much, and he isn't exactly the most rational thinker.  Krupien is not a hero, he's a delusional loser, who leaves his daughter to die.  He should never have survived being shot, but then little about this film rings true.  On the plus side, the special effects while nothing new, and small in scale, are done pretty well.  Too bad the story wasn't better conceived.  Had some different choices been made, this film could have been much better than 2.5 stars.The Thaw provides some mild entertainment value, although the mentally challenged individuals arguing about what to do, may drive you a bit mad.

1269148,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002I41KLE,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Long-dormant bug-like creatures, now awake because of global warming, attack the researchers and college students on the Arctic tundra. Except the brief opening sequence where a disaster of enormous scale is implied, ""The Thaw"" remains a typical low-budget B horror movie with a new trick or two. In this case its trick is Val Kilmer's character, Dr. Kruipen, who is seen dictating something before the camera, or the nasty horror poised to make a huge impact on human beings. Well, that's what he thinks.Maybe this is not exactly a very original concept, but still works as a serviceable plot. It is a familiar situation where unsuspecting characters, ethnically diverse and mostly young, are trapped in a remote location with unwelcome parasitic creatures. In ""The Thaw"" the creatures can attack from inside your body, and things only get worse when you have to deal with people who start behaving erratically.The creature effects of ""The Thaw"" are fairly impressive, which means those who don't like bugs or worms crawling on the skin should stay away. The film also uses the beautiful location of British Columbia, effectively creating isolated atmosphere. Unfortunately, the narrative is predictable, sometimes preposterous, with the cardboard characters doing exactly what we know they do. Also, though the acting of Val Kilmer (who appears as a support) is not bad, obviously this is not his best, either.Not a terrible movie, but not great either, with some nice effects.",2,(2.5 STARS) Killer Creature Horror Movie with Nice Effects,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,1479,"['Long-dormant', 'bug-like', 'creatures', 'now', 'awake', 'global', 'warming', 'attack', 'researchers', 'college', 'students', 'Arctic', 'tundra', 'brief', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'disaster', 'enormous', 'scale', 'implied', 'Thaw', 'typical', 'low-budget', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'new', 'trick', 'two', 'case', 'trick', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Kruipen', 'who', 'seen', 'dictating', 'something', 'camera', 'nasty', 'horror', 'poised', 'make', 'huge', 'impact', 'human', 'beings', 'Well', 'what', 'thinks.Maybe', 'not', 'exactly', 'very', 'original', 'concept', 'still', 'serviceable', 'plot', 'familiar', 'situation', 'where', 'unsuspecting', 'characters', 'ethnically', 'diverse', 'mostly', 'young', 'are', 'trapped', 'remote', 'location', 'unwelcome', 'parasitic', 'creatures', 'Thaw', 'creatures', 'can', 'attack', 'body', 'things', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'have', 'deal', 'people', 'who', 'start', 'behaving', 'erratically.The', 'creature', 'effects', 'Thaw', 'are', 'fairly', 'impressive', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'bugs', 'worms', 'crawling', 'skin', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'film', 'also', 'beautiful', 'location', 'British', 'Columbia', 'effectively', 'creating', 'isolated', 'atmosphere', 'Unfortunately', 'narrative', 'predictable', 'sometimes', 'preposterous', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'know', 'do', 'Also', 'acting', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'who', 'support', 'not', 'bad', 'obviously', 'not', 'best', 'terrible', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'nice', 'effects']",The Thaw
