I haven't liked any of the new ones they have on Hallmark this year. This one has the same plot as many of the Christmas movies. It should definitely be voted most cheesy ending ever, but it's a good way to veg out and enjoy the season. We've seen it three times so far and will probably watch it again. There was nothing bad and nothing brainy. It truly is just a good veg out movie to relax, watch and enjoy. The actors did a good job - even Joey Lawrence in that all-time cheesy ending. It was nice to see a movie where someone wasn't really in love with someone else, or another guy or girl is in the middle somehow.

Both sets of parents have their suspicions, best represented by the hilarious lighting of candles scene, but the appeasers try to continue their facade until cornered.  Meanwhile they are the last to know that they have come to admire and enjoy each other.  Not a new theme or movie idea, but a very likeable setting for this incarnation.Actors were well selected for this lighthearted slice of life, and the story becomes more plausible because all the lies have to be revealed.  What makes this especially appealing are the scenes where misunderstandings are cleared up with honest confrontation, and mutual openness to making things absolutely right.  Instead of just assuming things will work out and writing our own script to complete those thoughts, the writers included the path to real reconciliation.
