861361,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B00065HKMA,Andrew Desmond,"[7, 9]","""We Don't Live Here Anymore"" is a languidly told tale of human faults and frailties.  Its resolution, however, is less than satisfactory.The film involves four main characters.  These characters are two married couples in their thirties whose marriages are disintegrating.  There is sex between the partners outside of their marriages but within their group.  Although in most cases this would create perhaps hostile outrage within the marriages, in this case, it is largely seen as inevitable and almost acceptable.  Yet such arrangements, no matter what the circumstances, do involve playing with fire.Although the acting in this film is near flawless, there is something missing.  This missing piece may be that the characters are so lacking in warmth and none engage the viewer.  Each player is bleak, lacking a moral code and, thus, fails to leave the viewer with any real empathy for their plights.Although I found the film very easy to watch, its conclusion was without clarity and the characters were without warmth of any kind.  Unfortunately, the film was something of a let down.",3,Lacking in Warmth,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,1090,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'languidly', 'told', 'tale', 'human', 'faults', 'frailties', 'resolution', 'however', 'less', 'satisfactory.The', 'film', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'married', 'couples', 'thirties', 'marriages', 'are', 'disintegrating', 'sex', 'partners', 'marriages', 'group', 'most', 'cases', 'would', 'create', 'perhaps', 'hostile', 'outrage', 'marriages', 'case', 'largely', 'seen', 'inevitable', 'almost', 'acceptable', 'such', 'arrangements', 'matter', 'what', 'circumstances', 'do', 'involve', 'playing', 'acting', 'film', 'flawless', 'something', 'missing', 'missing', 'piece', 'may', 'be', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'lacking', 'warmth', 'none', 'engage', 'viewer', 'player', 'bleak', 'lacking', 'moral', 'code', 'thus', 'leave', 'viewer', 'real', 'empathy', 'plights.Although', 'found', 'film', 'very', 'easy', 'watch', 'conclusion', 'was', 'clarity', 'characters', 'were', 'warmth', 'kind', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'let', 'down']",N/A
861362,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00065HKMA,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","There is something so hauntingly real about `We Don't Live Here Anymore' that you end up walking away from this movie feeling dirty; like a sinner.  I remember the first time I watched this I wept because I felt every ounce of pain and regret and fear and guilt that was running through the veins of the characters on the screen.  I remember that I felt those same feelings when reading Andre Dubus' brilliant novella's that inspired this film (all of which can be found in the compellation work `We Don't Live Here Anymore').  Director John Curran marvelously brought to the screen one of the finest films I think ever made about marriage and relationships and the tragedy of the affair.The reason I mention that you feel dirty when watching this film is that the characters, as horrible and unsympathetic as they are, are truly relatable in the most complex and emotional ways.  Jack feels lost in a marriage he doesn't want.  He feels like his wife doesn't work for his affection anymore; that she's grown complacent.  Terry feels neglected and unwanted, unloved and alone.  Hank, drifting away in his own little world, doesn't cherish Edith the way that he should because monogamy is not something he believes in.  Edith, feeling neglected and slighted, seeks out the affections of a man who truly desires and values her.  Each character, flawed as they are, is real and grounded.  This has a lot to do with the performances by the very talented cast, but I'll get to that in a moment.So the film follows the torrid affair between Jack Linden and Edith Evans.  Jack is married to Terry and Edith to Hank, and the four of them are all great friends.  It's apparent that Hank favors Terry and she has obviously fantasized about him as well, but she would never cheat on her husband unless she was coerced.  When Jack and Edith's affair is uncovered by Terry that is just what happens.  Jack, in an attempt to squash his own guilt, protests that she should give herself to Hank.  This of course spirals down on all four of them as their actions end up crushing them in the end.Mark Ruffalo has always been an actor I saw great things for.  He has somewhat stayed under the radar for most of his career but her performances are never less than mesmerizing.  As Jack he truly gets under the skin of his character and brings his all too real emotions to life.  Laura Dern (screen goddess for many) delivers a brilliant performance here as well.  As Terry she is immediately the most sympathetic of the characters.  She is not the one in the initial affair and she truly loves her husband.  In the end we feel as though these events have scarred her deepest.  Peter Krause delivers a fine performance as Hank, but the film seems less interested in him than anyone else in the cast.  We are aware that he is struggling to write something important, to right something he loves and that he is more invested in his work than his wife but he never seems to be too important to us.The real standout in this lineup is inarguably Naomi Watts.  This actress is just superb in everything and the more I see her the more I am convinced that she is our next Kate Winslet (my screen goddess!).  As Edith she creates such a real and emotionally connected character.  Yes, she adulterous and we should be repelled by her actions, but the regret and guilt that racks her soul is enough to bring anyone to their knees.  There is one scene in particular, when Edith retreats to her bedroom after a tryst with Jack and lays upon her bed, and on her face is etched these sincere and moving expressions and pain and fear, regret and agonizing guilt and every time I think of that one scene I'm more convinced of her never-ending talent.In the end we can't help but think of the poor children who of course suffer more than anyone else when a marriage falls apart.  There is a beautiful scene towards the end with Jack and his two kids that is moving and memorable and moralistic for a film of this nature.I have complained before with a similar film (not really all that similar) about the `preachy' aspect of that said film.  What I love so much about `We Don't Live Here Anymore' is that it doesn't beat you with its preconceived notions on the matter or adultery but rather allows you to decide for yourselves who is in the wrong, who is being wronged, who is suffering the most, so on and so forth.  We are shown these four characters and are exposed to their lives and their actions and that is all.  There is no monologue explaining the woes of cheating on your spouse.  There is no moral dictated to us at the films conclusion.  We are shown these characters with all their warts and moles in clear view and we are asked to decide for ourselves what we think of them.  This is a beautiful way of allowing the audience to become one with the film and find themselves amidst the chaos.One thing that is clear by the time the credits role is that these marriages were over long before the affairs were started.  When I think of the title `We Don't Live Here Anymore' I can't help but relate it to that feeling you have when you're disconnected from the one you are supposed to love indefinitely.  It's almost as if you don't live in the same home anymore.  You sleep in the same bed, under the same roof yet you feel as though you aren't really there.That is the point of this film.Affairs don't break marriages; broken marriages start affairs.`We Don't Live Here Anymore' is a very difficult film to get through, especially if you've ever been the victim of an affair.  The film is gritty and very real and so emotions are bound to stir.  If you feel as though you can make it through this one I feel you'll be glad you did.  It's one of the purest and most remarkable looks at the mystery known as marriage.",5,Tragic and heartbreaking; one of the purest and most effective looks into the lives of the

861364,A3H2KLAV0VLQ0K,B00065HKMA,B26354,"[3, 3]","""She blooms she blooms and in May so hurt"" Mark Ruffalo's Jack says to Naomi Watts' Edith as they make their way into the woods to make love for the first time, starting their affair. ""In May I was alone,"" she answers, referring to her husband Hank's infidelity. So rare are films that show characters change (some too little too late, but at least they finally come to it). Probably the most beautifully scored film I have ever seen - the singular cello and fluttering piano notes blend through like a transparent, delicate cloth, and sounds from one scene often flow over into the next, causing a beautiful, dreamy continuity. Look for reasoning of what is underneath the affairs of these four characters instead of the affairs themselves. Yes, the affairs are tragic and destructive, but it isn't enough to simply judge them on their actions and call them immoral. These are people who love their children and are reaching out for comfort because they are suffering, (parallels are made between Jack and the character in Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilyich, the book Jack is teaching) and the guilt is all there too, Jack vomits on a run with Hank when they near the spot in the woods where he and Edith made love, and guilt is particularly within Edith (Watts' portrayal here is so devastatingly real) who is so incredibly wounded, the trust in her marriage broken way before she and Jack reach out to each other for comfort, love, support - something they aren't getting from their partners.The mismatch of each couple is underscored by their lovemaking with each person with their marriage partner - I found the sex between the marriage partners to be the most uncomfortable and difficult thing about the movie to watch - distorted and desperate - the sex between Edith and Hank is ugly and detached, but the sex between Edith and Jack is sexy and fun and represents perhaps what a marriage should be. Terry and Hank seem to be the odd people out in this film - the clueless Hank is emotionally distant - depressed, frustrated writer - and brags of his affairs, (Krause is so wonderful in this role and I have enjoyed his other work as well) and Terry is retreating with alcohol, her attempts at repairing her marriage rebuffed and undermined over and over by Jack. Terry is the only character who seems to be able to communicate her frustrations openly (they are justified and true) albeit in a destructive manner sometimes, and has no real interest in having an affair: her sex with Hank in the car is just that, the act itself with no real emotion behind it - more of a revenge for Jack's affair with Edith and also an attempt to get Jack to care. Terry is continually trying to reach out to her husband to make things work (this is one of Laura Dern's most brilliant performances). Edith is locked down emotionally: in one scene she is asked why she won't stop Hank from giving Terry a ride home: ""I don't know,"" her lockdown brilliantly underscored by the appearance of crossing signals throughout the movie, but see what you think. I also feel that the last shot of the film is left ambiguous, while offering a more concrete view of what point Hank and Edith have come to. The camera work and scoring in this film are unique and unusual, and the lovemaking between Ruffalo and Watts' characters is packed with heat; spontaneous, sexy and intimate. The movie was filmed in various locations in Vancouver, BC, which adds to the intimate atmosphere and small-town imagery. Other notables: interesting camera work, overlaying of scenes, and the kids (who sometimes actually steal the show) are absolutely adorable. Also listen for parts of Beethoven's Symphony #1 throughout - the first notes of the opening movement serve the subject matter of this film well.",5,She Blooms She Blooms and in May So Hurt,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,3763,"['blooms', 'May', 'so', 'hurt', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Jack', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Edith', 'make', 'way', 'woods', 'make', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'starting', 'affair', 'May', 'was', 'alone', 'referring', 'husband', 'Hank', 'infidelity', 'rare', 'are', 'films', 'show', 'characters', 'change', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'least', 'finally', 'come', 'Probably', 'most', 'beautifully', 'scored', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'singular', 'cello', 'fluttering', 'piano', 'notes', 'blend', 'transparent', 'delicate', 'cloth', 'one', 'scene', 'often', 'over', 'next', 'causing', 'beautiful', 'dreamy', 'continuity', 'Look', 'reasoning', 'what', 'underneath', 'affairs', 'four', 'characters', 'instead', 'affairs', 'Yes', 'affairs', 'are', 'tragic', 'destructive', ""n't"", 'enough', 'simply', 'judge', 'actions', 'call', 'immoral', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'children', 'are', 'reaching', 'out', 'comfort', 'are', 'suffering', 'parallels', 'are', 'made', 'Jack', 'character', 'Tolstoy', 'Death', 'Ivan', 'Ilyich', 'book', 'Jack', 'teaching', 'guilt', 'there', 'too', 'Jack', 'run', 'Hank', 'when', 'near', 'spot', 'woods', 'where', 'Edith', 'made', 'love', 'guilt', 'particularly', 'Edith', 'Watts', 'portrayal', 'here', 'so', 'devastatingly', 'real', 'who', 'so', 'incredibly', 'wounded', 'trust', 'marriage', 'broken', 'way', 'Jack', 'reach', 'other', 'comfort', 'love', 'support', 'something', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'partners.The', 'mismatch', 'couple', 'underscored', 'lovemaking', 'person', 'marriage', 'partner', 'found', 'sex', 'marriage', 'partners', 'be', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'difficult', 'thing', 'movie', 'watch', 'distorted', 'desperate', 'sex', 'Edith', 'Hank', 'ugly', 'detached', 'sex', 'Edith', 'Jack', 'sexy', 'fun', 'perhaps', 'what', 'marriage', 'should', 'be', 'Terry', 'Hank', 'seem', 'be', 'odd', 'people', 'out', 'film', 'clueless', 'Hank', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'depressed', 'frustrated', 'writer', 'brags', 'affairs', 'Krause', 'so', 'wonderful', 'role', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Terry', 'retreating', 'alcohol', 'attempts', 'repairing', 'marriage', 'rebuffed', 'undermined', 'Jack', 'Terry', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'communicate', 'frustrations', 'openly', 'are', 'justified', 'true', 'albeit', 'destructive', 'manner', 'sometimes', 'real', 'interest', 'having', 'affair', 'sex', 'Hank', 'car', 'just', 'that', 'act', 'real', 'emotion', 'more', 'revenge', 'Jack', 'affair', 'Edith', 'also', 'attempt', 'get', 'Jack', 'care', 'Terry', 'continually', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'husband', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'one', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'most', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Edith', 'locked', 'down', 'emotionally', 'one', 'scene', 'asked', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Hank', 'giving', 'Terry', 'ride', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lockdown', 'brilliantly', 'underscored', 'appearance', 'crossing', 'signals', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'also', 'feel', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'left', 'ambiguous', 'offering', 'more', 'concrete', 'view', 'what', 'point', 'Hank', 'Edith', 'have', 'come', 'camera', 'work', 'scoring', 'film', 'are', 'unique', 'unusual', 'lovemaking', 'Ruffalo', 'Watts', 'characters', 'packed', 'heat', 'spontaneous', 'sexy', 'intimate', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'various', 'locations', 'Vancouver', 'BC', 'intimate', 'atmosphere', 'small-town', 'imagery', 'Other', 'notables', 'interesting', 'camera', 'work', 'overlaying', 'scenes', 'kids', 'who', 'sometimes', 'actually', 'steal', 'show', 'are', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'Also', 'listen', 'parts', 'Beethoven', 'Symphony', '1', 'first', 'notes', 'opening', 'movement', 'serve', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'well']",N/A

It's filled with great acting, interesting direction, beautiful faces (Laura Dern looking nuttier than a Snickers, Mark Ruffalo fashionably tousled, Peter Krause looking for all the world like Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine and Naomi Watts, who makes me a little ill with longing).It's also filled with the kind of domestic situations that are eternally interesting to eavesdrop on.  Almost every shot seems designed to look like the cover of a Raymond Carver book (with fashions by J.

861368,AAPA4KQWA7UXN,B00065HKMA,cvairag,"[2, 2]","I don't wish to be irreverent, but my main response to this story was that Jack and Edith and Hank and Terry seemed much more physically and emotionally suited to each other than their mates.  For one thing, Terry (Dern) was taller than Jack (Ruffalo), and sort of stooped over him in certain scenes (menacingly, not unlike her father, in movies of yore).  I suppose the idea was that the domain of marriage is really the realm of interiority. But, frankly, I feel the physical has a lot to do with it.  Whether this phenomenon was intended by the filmakers or not, I could not quite fathom. I guess by beginning mise en scene, the original relationships between the mates never get established as much as their new loves, especially the heated affair between Jack and Edith.But, if it were the case that they had found more suitable partners in their friends' spouses, why did the couples not simply accept the way of nature and hang out as a merry foursome?  I believe the what was implied was that the physical attraction was fueled, in part at least, by the covert nature of the relationships and their proximity, rather than the possibility that marital exclusivity is a social form whose basic functions and values are increasingly perceived as relative to the primary importance child rearing.And it must be noted that the child acting in the sophisticated contexts of the film is uniformally superb.  As far as the adult acting: Naomi Watts is a superstar in her generation - an actress of insight and power reminiscent in a certain way of the young Tuesday Weld - but generations beyond in subtlety and depth. I cannot express my gratitude enough for her openess, generosity, and courage in her examination of female sensuality in all her films. Her undeniable beauty, which seems to grow more profound as her characters sink into the depths of tragedy, is framed very well in this one.  The other three all have their moments (and bless Ruffalo for openly opposing the war) - as does the script - although, I will say that as a teacher at a small college, if I ever spoke to a young student as Hank does in a number of scenes, I would be in serious violation of my obligation to the community. I do not know if this lack of realism was unconscious on the part of the film-makers, or simply irresponsible in the attempt characterize the dark, reckless side of Hank - but the public ought to know that that type of talk is monitored in most schools.In the final analysis, almost in spite of its intentions, but most sadly, not quite, the whole comes off as a rather soporific soap, rather than the serious pyschodramatic investigation it wants to be.",3,and the winner for best casting is . . . ?,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,2658,"['do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'be', 'irreverent', 'main', 'response', 'story', 'was', 'Jack', 'Edith', 'Hank', 'Terry', 'seemed', 'much', 'more', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'suited', 'other', 'mates', 'one', 'thing', 'Terry', 'Dern', 'was', 'taller', 'Jack', 'Ruffalo', 'sort', 'stooped', 'certain', 'scenes', 'menacingly', 'not', 'father', 'movies', 'yore', 'suppose', 'idea', 'was', 'domain', 'marriage', 'really', 'realm', 'interiority', 'frankly', 'feel', 'physical', 'lot', 'do', 'Whether', 'phenomenon', 'was', 'intended', 'filmakers', 'not', 'could', 'not', 'quite', 'fathom', 'guess', 'beginning', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'original', 'relationships', 'mates', 'never', 'get', 'established', 'as', 'much', 'new', 'loves', 'especially', 'heated', 'affair', 'Jack', 'Edith.But', 'were', 'case', 'had', 'found', 'more', 'suitable', 'partners', 'friends', 'spouses', 'why', 'did', 'couples', 'not', 'simply', 'accept', 'way', 'nature', 'hang', 'out', 'merry', 'foursome', 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'implied', 'was', 'physical', 'attraction', 'was', 'fueled', 'part', 'least', 'covert', 'nature', 'relationships', 'proximity', 'rather', 'possibility', 'marital', 'exclusivity', 'social', 'form', 'basic', 'functions', 'values', 'are', 'increasingly', 'perceived', 'relative', 'primary', 'importance', 'child', 'rearing.And', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'child', 'acting', 'sophisticated', 'contexts', 'film', 'uniformally', 'superb', 'As', 'far', 'adult', 'acting', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'superstar', 'generation', 'actress', 'insight', 'power', 'reminiscent', 'certain', 'way', 'young', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'generations', 'subtlety', 'depth', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'gratitude', 'enough', 'openess', 'generosity', 'courage', 'examination', 'female', 'sensuality', 'films', 'undeniable', 'beauty', 'grow', 'more', 'profound', 'characters', 'sink', 'depths', 'tragedy', 'framed', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'other', 'three', 'have', 'moments', 'bless', 'Ruffalo', 'openly', 'opposing', 'war', 'script', 'will', 'say', 'teacher', 'small', 'college', 'ever', 'spoke', 'young', 'student', 'Hank', 'number', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'serious', 'violation', 'obligation', 'community', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'lack', 'realism', 'was', 'unconscious', 'part', 'film-makers', 'simply', 'irresponsible', 'attempt', 'characterize', 'dark', 'reckless', 'side', 'Hank', 'public', 'ought', 'know', 'type', 'talk', 'monitored', 'most', 'schools.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'almost', 'spite', 'intentions', 'most', 'sadly', 'not', 'quite', 'whole', 'off', 'rather', 'soporific', 'soap', 'rather', 'serious', 'pyschodramatic', 'investigation', 'be']",N/A

Maybe it's because every married couple goes through the feelings expressed in this film.  Laura Dern, Mark Ruffalo, Naomi Watts & Peter Krause star as two couples whose relationships are rattled by adultery.  These two couples have very different relationships yet are looking for exactly the same thing.Jack (Ruffalo) is a college professor married to Terry (Dern).  Terry loves Jack but Jack is falling in love with Edith (Watts) who is married to Hank (Krause) who doesn't love her but is attracted to Terry.  Jack and Edith fall into an affair that causes more pain to each of them then to their respective partners.  Watching Jack and Edith react to their mates after they've just been with each other, the tears, the looks, the concern in their eyes.  Hank in the meantime is looking for someone to cure his boredom with his wife, and Terry may be that woman, and since Jack's guilt is tearing him apart he encourages Terry and Hank's relationship in order to justify is infidelity.What Jack never banked on was realizing the love he had for his wife and his children.  After his wife sleeps with Hank, Jack is panged with regret and heartache as he watches his marriage fall apart, the marriage he felt he was tired of but in actuality it's the only thing he wants and needs.This movie is a wake up call for all of us who are falling out of love with our relationships, our lives in general and the ones we share it with.  It's brilliantly scripted and acted and flows wonderfully, delivering its point beautifully.  Watts and Dern are brilliant here and show so much feeling in all their words, in all their actions.

861372,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B00065HKMA,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[3, 4]","Four very capable actors are at the core of this film: Mark Ruffalo (excellent but just a bit out of his depth here), Peter Krause (who resembles Jim Carrey in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""), Laura Dern (the best acting of the bunch) and Naomi Watts (proves that blondes can be hot and act very well too, wow).  If I had not found all 4 to be interesting and involving characters I might not have made it through this film, but overall it is very well written though at times too ""written""---the dialogue comes off a little too academic/theatrical, not as natural as it should be.However the cinematography, camera work and soundtrack manage to gloss over these slow spots, and as a whole the film works in exposing many of the games, shams and contractual lies that comprise what most of society considers to be ""marriage"" with a capital M.  Conventional/conformist/conservative viewers will likely find this deconstruction of marriage deeply unsettling and even enraging, esp. the actions of the Peter Krause character who in some ways is quite a mature fellow, perhaps the most mature of the four.This movie takes its time in revealing character, but to its credit has the cojones to leave many questions and issues unanswered.  For example it's unclear why Mark Ruffalo's character decides not to divorce his wife, whether he CHOOSES to live a lie or he simply does not want to hurt/lose his children.  The U.S. divorce rate has been steady at 50% for decades...if there were a magic button that unhappy couples could push that would undo the birth of their children, it begs the question of how much higher that rate would be.It makes for an engrossing and thought-provoking 2 hours, which invites repeated viewing.",4,worth watching more than once,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,1730,"['Four', 'very', 'capable', 'actors', 'are', 'core', 'film', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'excellent', 'just', 'bit', 'depth', 'here', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'who', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'best', 'acting', 'bunch', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'blondes', 'can', 'be', 'hot', 'act', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'wow', 'had', 'not', 'found', 'all', '4', 'be', 'interesting', 'involving', 'characters', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'overall', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'though', 'times', 'too', 'written', '-the', 'dialogue', 'off', 'little', 'too', 'academic/theatrical', 'not', 'as', 'natural', 'should', 'be.However', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'work', 'soundtrack', 'manage', 'gloss', 'slow', 'spots', 'whole', 'film', 'exposing', 'many', 'games', 'shams', 'contractual', 'lies', 'comprise', 'what', 'most', 'society', 'considers', 'be', 'marriage', 'capital', 'M.', 'Conventional/conformist/conservative', 'viewers', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'deconstruction', 'marriage', 'deeply', 'unsettling', 'even', 'enraging', 'esp', 'actions', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'character', 'who', 'ways', 'quite', 'mature', 'fellow', 'perhaps', 'most', 'mature', 'four.This', 'movie', 'time', 'revealing', 'character', 'credit', 'cojones', 'leave', 'many', 'questions', 'issues', 'unanswered', 'example', 'unclear', 'why', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'character', 'not', 'divorce', 'wife', 'CHOOSES', 'live', 'lie', 'simply', 'not', 'want', 'hurt/lose', 'children', 'U.S.', 'divorce', 'rate', 'been', 'steady', '50', '%', 'decades', 'were', 'magic', 'button', 'unhappy', 'couples', 'could', 'push', 'would', 'undo', 'birth', 'children', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'higher', 'rate', 'would', 'be.It', 'engrossing', 'thought-provoking', '2', 'hours', 'repeated', 'viewing']",N/A
861373,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00065HKMA,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 10]","Exhausting. This film is so desultory that it's hard to care about the characters and what they go through in this film. Perhaps that was the intention of director John Curran and screenwriter Larry Gross, that marriage can reach a point among people so unaware of themselves that adultery becomes a matter-of-fact, negotiation ploy rather than a source of betrayal and heartbreak. This nihilistic view permeates the whole film, and that is both its chief asset and its worst failing. The benefit is that we are not given a lot of pumped-up drama about guilt, which would have been the more predictable route to take here. The film feels honest in its treatment of two couples, who happen to be within convenient proximity for two of them, Jack and Edith, to start an affair and the other two, Hank and Terry, to do the same as if they are expected to. The problem, however, is that we are not given much in way of a back story for us to care what happens to the relationships, either the marriages that are crumbling or the affairs that develop in the emotional void of their lives. There are no showy Edward Albee-esque scenes, no moments of great revelation that draw us closer to the characters, and the result is that we are indifferent to their fate at the end of the film.Fortunately, the acting partially compensates for the relentlessly enervating tone. In the least interesting role, Peter Krause credibly plays Hank, the frustrated, emotionally detached college professor, who at first seems like a pathetic womanizer but then gradually reveals himself to be the catalyst for all that occurs in the four people's lives. At times, he seems near catatonic, I assume to show the depth of his character's emptiness. Naomi Watts plays his wife Edith as rather flirtatious and manipulative at first, but then she starts to reveal the same hollowness that Hank has, showing little concern for what the consequences would be should her affair with Jack be disclosed. I think Watts is the least credible of the quartet of actors perhaps because she is developed as the most cryptic in motivation. This is also unfortunately a case where her youth and beauty work against the exhausted character she is playing. Their characters' marriage seems so dead at the beginning that it is difficult to assess who was more responsible for the state it was in, and frankly it's hard to care what happens to them.Mark Ruffalo, so good in Kenneth Lonergan's ""You Can Count On Me"", plays the de facto emotional core of the film, a seemingly more conscientious husband than Hank but likely the most emotionally stunted of the four. As Jack, he is a passive-aggressive husband who cannot come to terms with the state of his marriage and can only justify his affair through the condescending view he has of his wife's drinking and messy housekeeping. It's a tough role, but Ruffalo does capture the fulcrum of emotional frustration. Unfortunately what he sacrifices is a lot of the sympathy that should have gone his way as the story evolves. Top acting honors have to go to Laura Dern in a brave performance as Terry. She gets under the skin of her character with enveloping intensity as she desperately clings onto her self-esteem and tries hard to avoid becoming the harridan that Jack wants her to be to get out of his marriage. Her character is the only one capable of honest confrontations, and Dern seizes every moment given to her with piercing intelligence. It's Terry's sensibility, not the emotionally drawn out scenes between Jack, Edith and their respective children, that almost saves the end of the film but not quite. Despite some strong acting, this is a disappointing downer of a film no matter how you slice it.",2,Good Actors Drowning in Marital Catatonia,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,3715,"['Exhausting', 'film', 'so', 'desultory', 'hard', 'care', 'characters', 'what', 'go', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'intention', 'director', 'John', 'Curran', 'screenwriter', 'Larry', 'Gross', 'marriage', 'can', 'reach', 'point', 'people', 'so', 'unaware', 'matter-of-fact', 'negotiation', 'ploy', 'rather', 'source', 'betrayal', 'heartbreak', 'nihilistic', 'view', 'whole', 'film', 'chief', 'asset', 'worst', 'failing', 'benefit', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'lot', 'pumped-up', 'drama', 'guilt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'predictable', 'route', 'take', 'here', 'film', 'feels', 'honest', 'treatment', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'convenient', 'proximity', 'two', 'Jack', 'Edith', 'start', 'affair', 'other', 'two', 'Hank', 'Terry', 'do', 'same', 'are', 'expected', 'problem', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'way', 'back', 'story', 'care', 'what', 'relationships', 'marriages', 'are', 'crumbling', 'affairs', 'develop', 'emotional', 'void', 'lives', 'are', 'showy', 'Edward', 'Albee-esque', 'scenes', 'moments', 'great', 'revelation', 'closer', 'characters', 'result', 'are', 'indifferent', 'fate', 'end', 'film.Fortunately', 'acting', 'partially', 'compensates', 'relentlessly', 'enervating', 'tone', 'least', 'interesting', 'role', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'credibly', 'Hank', 'frustrated', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'first', 'pathetic', 'womanizer', 'then', 'gradually', 'be', 'catalyst', 'four', 'people', 'lives', 'times', 'catatonic', 'assume', 'show', 'depth', 'character', 'emptiness', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'wife', 'Edith', 'rather', 'flirtatious', 'manipulative', 'first', 'then', 'reveal', 'same', 'hollowness', 'Hank', 'showing', 'little', 'concern', 'what', 'consequences', 'would', 'be', 'should', 'affair', 'Jack', 'be', 'disclosed', 'think', 'Watts', 'least', 'credible', 'quartet', 'actors', 'perhaps', 'developed', 'most', 'cryptic', 'motivation', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'case', 'where', 'youth', 'beauty', 'work', 'exhausted', 'character', 'playing', 'characters', 'marriage', 'so', 'dead', 'beginning', 'difficult', 'assess', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'responsible', 'state', 'was', 'frankly', 'hard', 'care', 'what', 'them.Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'so', 'good', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'de', 'facto', 'emotional', 'core', 'film', 'seemingly', 'more', 'conscientious', 'husband', 'Hank', 'likely', 'most', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'four', 'Jack', 'passive-aggressive', 'husband', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'terms', 'state', 'marriage', 'can', 'only', 'justify', 'affair', 'condescending', 'view', 'wife', 'drinking', 'messy', 'housekeeping', 'tough', 'role', 'Ruffalo', 'capture', 'fulcrum', 'emotional', 'frustration', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'lot', 'sympathy', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'story', 'Top', 'acting', 'honors', 'have', 'go', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'brave', 'performance', 'Terry', 'skin', 'character', 'enveloping', 'intensity', 'desperately', 'clings', 'self-esteem', 'hard', 'avoid', 'becoming', 'harridan', 'Jack', 'be', 'get', 'marriage', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'capable', 'honest', 'confrontations', 'Dern', 'moment', 'given', 'piercing', 'intelligence', 'Terry', 'sensibility', 'not', 'emotionally', 'drawn', 'out', 'scenes', 'Jack', 'Edith', 'respective', 'children', 'almost', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'strong', 'acting', 'disappointing', 'downer', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'slice']",N/A

861378,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00065HKMA,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE is a tough movie based on two searingly poignant short stories by Andre Dubus ('In the Bedroom', 'House of Sand and Fog', 'Meditations from a Moveable Chair, 'Adultery and Other Choices', 'Broken Vessels') adapted with great care for the screen by Larry Goss.  Dubus knows how to surgically open individual lives to expose the beating heart beneath, a heart that may be so abused and tattered that the mere fact that it is still able to support its body is shockingly formidable.Under John Curran's direction this four-character story with added children is one of the more potent examinations of marriage in the 21st century.  The two couples involved are middle class, suburbanites, friends bonded by college ties and by the fact that the two men are professors in the same school.  Hank (Mark Ruffalo) is married to Terry (Laura Dern) but is having an affair with Edith (Naomi Watts) who is married to Hank (Peter Krause). The four appear so closely knit as friends that it makes their infidelities seem like incest.  Both couples have children who are all too aware of the discord under their roofs, especially when the two couples are not sharing time together as is their mode of existence.Neither couple is happily married: all four people see the need to stay together with their respective spouses because of their children, but each craves intimacy of the carnal and passionate kind that has disappeared from their married unions.  No one is to blame in this quartet as each member is participating in  adultery with their opposite couple.  The manner in which these needs and acts occur, persist, and scar each of them is the driver of this remarkable film.Ruffalo, Dern, Watts and Krause are all extraordinary in their work here.  This kind of ensemble commitment is usually reserved or observed in the sanctity of a concert hall when listening to a gifted string quartet perform the works of Bartok or Shostakovich.  Yet for all the magnificence of their achievements under John Curran's taut direction, some of the most memorable moments are reserved for the writing and delivery of the lines of the children of these dysfunctional couples:  the sensitivity of the children's observation of the progress of the games is terrifying.This is a tough movie about a tough subject: it needs to be seen.

Of course, Closer was a play for a lot of years before the movie, and ...Anymore was a short story, so who knows which actually came out first.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[5, 11]","""We Don't Live Here Anymore,"" John Curran's downbeat domestic drama, adapted from two novellas by Andres Dubus, is enough of a bummer to make anyone contemplating marriage move to Brazil - alone. Jack Linden, (Mark Ruffalo), and Hank Evans, (Peter Krause), along with their respective spouses Terry, (Laura Dern) and Edith, (Naomi Watts), are close friends who share much in common - including each other's spouses. All four are miserable, depressed, desperate and disappointed. So much for the purported secret thrills of infidelity.The two men are English professors at a local college. The wives keep house, Edith better than Terry - one is meticulous, the other a slob, and take care of their children. Hank, a writer who has his office bulletin board plastered with rejection slips, is detached, moody, seemingly amoral, with a history of philandering. He has minimal energy for his family. His wife is well aware of all this. She is in the middle of an intense affair with Jack, her best friend's husband, and may have initiated the dalliance out of revenge for hubby's lurid past. Jack, in love with Edith, shows even less affection to Terry than Hank shows to Edith. He is petulant and manipulative, like a little boy, but he loves his kids. I wanted to pop a Prozac about here. Terry is faithful to Jack, so far. She loves him and wants to make everything better. Masochistic behavior? Things will never improve, so she drinks and throws tantrums. Jack could care less. So, Terry and Hank begin a relationship of their own. Vindictive? Who knows. None of these individuals show any sign of becoming happier, even with the extra curricular activities. And I cannot find an adult in the entire movie that I like. All of them need immediate intensive therapy. The children are cute, but ones feels that if they spend 48 hours more around their parents, they too will be afflicted.I kept waiting for something to happen, besides the emoting, especially with the building dramatic, musical score. Instead, the film just sits there and stagnates. There is almost no humor to lighten things up. The excellent ensemble cast does an outstanding job with what they have been given. But they haven't much to work with, at all. A waste of talent, if you ask me. Are these self absorbed, arrogant people supposed to be sympathetic...or remotely appealing, as they contemplate the minutia of their lives? What it the point Curran is trying to make? Whatever it is, didn't ""Whose Afraid Of Virginia Woolf"" do a better job with marital pathos in 1966? These four need to get new lives...fast.If you are looking for an evening watching marital destruction, with discordant notes - by all means, don't miss ""We Don't Live Here Anymore.""

He describes himself as a reader, not a writer, in contrast to Hank, who gets the occasional story accepted by the New Yorker, and he seems trapped by his marriage and unrewarding job. Played by Mark Ruffalo, always good at cuddly muddled characters, he is surprisingly sympathetic; despite the emotional damage he does to the highly strung Terry. Hank on the other hand is cast as the villain. He doesn't actually mind Jake having it off with Edith as he thinks this might make her easier to live with, and anyway he himself chases anything in skirts. Peter Krause does a fine job, but you are left wondering is Mark not equally at fault? As the two wives, Laura Dern as Terry and Naomi Watts as Edith also put in strong performances.While there is plenty of emotion below the surface the story stays low-key, despite a couple of suggestions that one or other of the characters is about to do something awful. Andre Dubus (who had a Louisiana Cajun background) was credited with having a Catholic sensibility, whatever that means, and I suppose he was saying that adultery has a price. However he also seemed to be saying that for this bunch it was practically to be expected. That being the case, it's hard to be harsh on them, except perhaps the priapic Hank who in the end suffers the most.The setting is almost idyllic (suburban Vancouver standing in for New England) and the cinematography is great. Although this film is rather dull there is interest in the characters but the story is so trite it is hard to sustain one's interest. The dialogue is peppered with the odd literary quote but is generally pretty banal.

861383,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B00065HKMA,Jonathan Appleseed,"[8, 10]","Adultery is never a pleasant topic, in any medium. Most people, whether in marriages, long-term relationships, or romances that last a few months to a few years experience the pain of being cheated on. What the person that is being cheated on doesn't often see is the behind the scenes look - and this film gives us that behind the scenes look from every angle of what is not a love triangle, but a ""love square"".I found myself furious with Jack (Ruffalo), who stood in the kitchen with his wife Terry (Dern) and lied to her while looking into her eyes. It's terrifying, really - that someone can look another person in the eyes and not only lie to them, but turn it around to make it seem as if it's their fault that they're having an argument, that it's their fault that they have suspicions. The person that does that is despicable. Later in the film, when Terry admits to having an affair with Jack's best friend Hank (Krause), Jack had every opportunity to come clean. Instead he is silent, and has the audacity to fling Terry onto a chair and raise his fist to her.I never did fully understand Edith (Watts). Jack admitted to loving her, but I don't recall her saying the same. It seemed that for her, she was acting out against Hank's unfaithfulness. When she leaves him in the end, Hank asks, ""Why"", and she replies, ""Because I can"". Apparently, now that everything was in the open, she felt that she could leave. But as I said, I'm not entirely certain that I understood her. I rack that up to my own inadequacies as opposed to that of the film itself.This is a very, very sad film. Every character is tragic, and none are very sympathetic. Terry *might* be the most sympathetic character, but the reality of her life is that she is, quite frankly, a lazy drunk. She puts some of that on Jack, and there's certainly some merit in her accusation, but we all know that everyone is responsible for their own actions.The d&eacute;nouement was a little confusing.

861384,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00065HKMA,Josh Hitchens,"[3, 3]","""We Don't Live Here Anymore"" features a cast of amazing actors and a screenplay based on stories by ""In the Bedroom's"" Andre Dubus. It's a pity, then, that this film doesn't reach the tragic heights that it promises. What puports to be a searing expose of modern marriage turns out to be something less, and the film wouldn't be as good as it is without its quartet of gifted actors.Jack and Terry (Mark Ruffalo and Laura Dern) have been married for ten years. They have two children, and a marriage that's on the verge of collapsing. Terry isn't the woman Jack married anymore. She has become a slob and an alcoholic, bitter about her life's missed opportunities. Jack has an affair with Edith (Naomi Watts), the wife of his best friend Hank (Peter Krause). Hank and Terry find out about their spouse's infidelity, and decide to have an affair themselves. It remains to be seen whether or not the damage done to their marriages can be repaired.The film is exquisitely directed by John Curran, dividing the film between the beautiful and the mundane. The screenplay is adequate, but sometimes has terrible dialogue that makes the plot almost unbelievable. The reason why ""We Don't Live Here Anymore"" is worth watching is for the intense, precise performances of Mark Ruffalo, Laura Dern, Naomi Watts, and Peter Krause. Ruffalo's Jack is supremely unhappy with Terry and loves Edith, but is guilt-ridden by what the consequences of his affair will bring for his children. Krause is given the least to do in the film, but creates a very intriguing portrait of a man incapable of really loving anyone.That said, ""We Don't Live Here Anymore"" belongs to Laura Dern and Naomi Watts. Dern, giving her best performance in years, buries herself deep into the ugly rage and disappointment of Terry. It's a brutal, unfliching performance, and Dern should receive high recognition for her work. However, I think her performance is surpassed by the wrenching work done by Naomi Watts. Fresh off of brilliant turns in ""21 Grams"" and ""Mulholland Drive,"" Watts acts with heartbreaking simplicity the pain of Edith, whose joyless life is only made better when she cheats on Hank with Jack. Edith knows that Hank doesn't love her, and is looking for comfort any way she can. She also realizes that what she's doing is wrong, but can't stop. Naomi Watts makes Edith a fascinating enigma, a woman who can't reconcile the pain her happiness with Jack brings. In the final scenes, she owns the movie.There were times when watching this movie that I was begging for something to happen. ""We Don't Live Here Anymore"" could have been a powerful film, but somehow the impact just isn't there. It has wonderful moments, and a lot of mediocre ones. I recommend it for the direction and the acting, just don't be surprised when it leaves you wanting more.",3,Adult Foolishness,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,2826,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'cast', 'amazing', 'actors', 'screenplay', 'based', 'stories', 'Bedroom', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'pity', 'then', 'film', ""n't"", 'reach', 'tragic', 'heights', 'What', 'be', 'searing', 'expose', 'modern', 'marriage', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'less', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'good', 'quartet', 'gifted', 'actors.Jack', 'Terry', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'marriage', 'verge', 'collapsing', 'Terry', ""n't"", 'woman', 'Jack', 'married', 'anymore', 'become', 'slob', 'alcoholic', 'bitter', 'life', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'Jack', 'affair', 'Edith', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'Hank', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Hank', 'Terry', 'find', 'out', 'spouse', 'infidelity', 'decide', 'have', 'affair', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'damage', 'done', 'marriages', 'can', 'be', 'repaired.The', 'film', 'exquisitely', 'directed', 'John', 'Curran', 'dividing', 'film', 'beautiful', 'mundane', 'screenplay', 'adequate', 'sometimes', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'reason', 'why', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'worth', 'watching', 'intense', 'precise', 'performances', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Ruffalo', 'Jack', 'supremely', 'unhappy', 'Terry', 'Edith', 'guilt-ridden', 'what', 'consequences', 'affair', 'will', 'bring', 'children', 'Krause', 'given', 'least', 'do', 'film', 'very', 'intriguing', 'portrait', 'man', 'incapable', 'really', 'loving', 'said', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Dern', 'giving', 'best', 'performance', 'years', 'buries', 'deep', 'ugly', 'rage', 'disappointment', 'Terry', 'brutal', 'unfliching', 'performance', 'Dern', 'should', 'receive', 'high', 'recognition', 'work', 'However', 'think', 'performance', 'surpassed', 'wrenching', 'work', 'done', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Fresh', 'brilliant', 'turns', '21', 'Grams', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'Watts', 'heartbreaking', 'simplicity', 'pain', 'Edith', 'joyless', 'life', 'only', 'made', 'better', 'when', 'Hank', 'Jack', 'Edith', 'Hank', ""n't"", 'love', 'looking', 'comfort', 'way', 'can', 'also', 'what', 'doing', 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Edith', 'fascinating', 'enigma', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reconcile', 'pain', 'happiness', 'Jack', 'brings', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie.There', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'begging', 'something', 'happen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'film', 'somehow', 'impact', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'lot', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'recommend', 'direction', 'acting', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'wanting', 'more']",N/A

But that's about the best thing that I can say about this film.The story starts at a small party, when Mark Ruffalo drives his friend's wife, played by Naomi Watts to get some beer.  Suddenly they are embracing and making a date to meet the next day.  In the meantime, Laura Dern is left alone with her husband's friend, played by Peter Krause.  She's drinking too much and he makes a pass at her.  After that the story gets more complex and tries to get into the heart and souls of the characters.

Frankly though, the romances were just too full of angst, and didn't seem like any fun.I found the script tedious as and talky.  Also, the director tried too hard to be artsy.  For example, every time Mark Ruffalo would pass the area where he and Naomi Watts had their little escapade, the audience would have to see a very fast memory flashback.  There were so many of these scenes that it disrupted the flow of the story.  There was discordant music throughout that tried to create drama but instead it was just distracting.

Both Hank (Peter Krause) and Jack (Mark Ruffalo) are teachers at a community college, Hank an aspiring novelist who treats infidelity as a necessary adjunct to his life. The most sophisticated of the four, he embraces the romance of the writer's ancillary angst, women serving as both inspiration and gratification. His wife, Edith (Naomi Watts) is aware of Hank's indiscretions, increasingly bitter and disappointed with her marriage, but unwilling to act.Edith and Hank are good friends with Jack and Terry (Laura Dern), socializing frequently, a source of titillation for a clandestine affair between Jack and Edith. Edith embarks on the affair partly from spite and partly from devastating loneliness, but Jack is not as cavalier as his fellow adulterer, blindsided by daydreams of his lover and irritated by Terry's obvious flaws. As Jack, Ruffalo is sensitive and thoughtful, playing the formerly faithful husband with subtle grace, sinking into a moral quagmire that renders him unable to stop the affair or leave his wife. This man enjoys the comforts of marriage, children and the routine, almost undone by the risks he is taking to meet Edith.The jewel of the movie is Laura Dern as Terry, her performance flawless as the confused, wounded wife who senses her husband's betrayal but won't confront him, crippled by her own inadequacies. Dern and Ruffalo move in perfect counterpoint, circling their marriage, challenged in ways they never anticipated. He obsesses over the other woman and adores his children, but there is more emotional depth here than may appear. This is a man who cannot abide his own betrayal. Edith realizes that eventually the affair will be exposed, almost anticipating the ensuing confrontation.Under the direction of John Curran, the insightful script is riveting in the hands of these actors, the subdued atmosphere belying a tight undercurrent of tension, a sense that something terrible might happen to these people, especially Jack and Terry. The director manipulates this tension to pull the characters back and forth, their interactions emotionally charged, until finally the truth of each marriage is revealed. This movie has been compared to The Ice Storm, but I never made any such connection when watching the film. The Ice Storm is cynical, a study in carelessness, but this film carries the weight of truth, how easily marriage gets side-tracked by tedium, how simple it is to forget the cost of infidelity.Krause plays an egocentric, insensitive cad, Watts the long-suffering wife driven to her own solutions, but Dern is the heart of the movie, waxing hot and cold, caught up in her own deceptions, bruised by Jack's betrayal, both of them torn between need and responsibility. The couple is faced with the consequences of their actions, where nothing happens in a vacuum and the children pay the price of their parent's self-indulgence. There are no easy answers, no great epiphany, only hard truths and the concessions demanded by modern marriage.

So there you have it; the dilemma: a great cast with juicy, wife-swapping fodder for a movie, but the damn thing's over-edited and just stays on the same emotional level the whole time.And that doesn't make sense, considering it's such rocky territory. Jack and Edith are having, and have been having, a steamy little affair, and though Hank may have an idea, Terry still has yet to catch on. Hank is notorious for infidelity, with one in his past that nearly killed his marriage to Edith; you get the idea that killing the marriage wouldn't be so bad. Jack wants to, since he loves Edith, but the emotionally high-strung Terry is a strong force in his life that he can't just toss off like that. Considering there's more to the plot than that, this adaptation of two Andre Dubus short stories sounds tight and layered on the outside, but paraded across the screen, it has a quality of sameness that fails to elevate it to the full-blooded psychodrama that Dubus' In the Bedroom was.Of course, at times, I derived a kind of pleasure watching the cast members work, as much as they're surrounded by inadequacies in the script, editing, and pacing of the film. Mark Ruffalo has reached the point that Julianne Moore did in 1997 with Boogie Nights: he proves that he can sink his teeth into any kind of role and make it look effortless and stunning. He takes Jack, a schlubby English professor with ambivalent tendencies toward his wife and the hots for his best friend's wife, and somehow creates a believable persona. Peter Krause, finally getting some big-screen time, has a boyish glee as he navigates the immoral world of Hank. Dern and Watts, though, are both tarnished by Larry Gross' uneven screenplay. The women of We Don't Live are submissive housewives who are either neurotic (Dern's Terry) or just plain awkwardly written (Watts' Edith).I don't get how this movie, with so much potential, just seems to languish without any rise and fall. Maybe it's the fact that it's hard to truly care anything about a foursome who f**k around with their respective friends' spouses, when they're given few redeeming qualities and then further surrounded by kids who seem more reasonable than they are (a scene toward the end of the film shows Jack's kids discussing theology; maybe they should counsel their mommy and daddy). Then again, I think it all comes down to that initial scene. Anymore begins with a quick-paced opener that cracks wide its characters, but then fails to really explore them in any way besides explaining who loves whom, etc.For all my misgivings about We Don't Live Here Anymore, I can't say that I was ever really, truly bored. There's something about watching good actors work that makes that impossible. And thank God, the film does seem to explore longer takes and deeper conversations by the end, and it does have some kind of a fitting finale. It's a strange film, though, not necessarily in its plot (mundane and obvious) or its execution (too technically heavy-handed, too emotional vague), but in the general effect of it. For nearly two hours, I sat and watched two marriages getting torn apart...but I can't say it had much of an effect. I hate to talk about a movie like a drug, but the analogy works; I've been high on a lot of great films this summer, but this one didn't even give a buzz. See this one if you like the cast, but don't expect what they've delivered in the past.

Their pairings are mechanical, if there is any so-called Love, it is fleeting and only of the moment. These are people who have experienced Love and found it to be lacking. They talk a lot, they fight and argue more: but all of it means nothing and seems to only be a means to pass the day without slitting their throats.Where director Curran gets it right though is how he shows that nothing, none of the arguments leads to any kind of easy resolutions: in fact there is no resolution to any of this at all.

He picks interesting roles and knows how to express a lot without saying much.  This film could very well be an extension of his role in ""XX/XY"", since it covers similar ground.  The film starts out with the regular get togethers two couples have, with Jack (Ruffalo) making a beer run with the wife, Edith (Naomi Watts) of his friend Hank (Peter Krause), leaving his own wife, Terry (Laura Dern) to stay behind with Hank, who has the hots for her.  This sets into motion the conflict going on in both couples, where love seems to be missing as each man lusts after the other man's wife.There are flaws in the film:  its slow at times, we see little of what brought each person to their spouse, how the couples became friends with each other, and when did things go bad in each relationship?  Those are some unanswered questions.  The scenes are edited quite brilliantly, I thought, and there was an interesting flow to them.  The dialogue was superb and the acting by Ruffalo and Watts were stand-out in this film.  The person who bothered me the most was Laura Dern, because I like her in other films but got the impression that she was just wrong for the role.  Her facial expressions were downright scary and some of her dialogue was off the wall.  She's not a sympathetic character, though its her husband Jack who's the sleazeball.  Hank is even sleazier, as he seems okay with the wife swapping, because he gets to have Terry (Dern) and doesn't feel guilty about his wife because she gets to love Jack.  Hank offers an interesting personal philosophy to Jack about love and sex and how he believes that sex is more fun without the complications of love.The film doesn't really build to anything, except shattered relationships in the two couples.  The choices they make differ, but it doesn't really add up to a big picture.  It's not a great film, but I do find it interesting in the way it portrays marriage.  Its a mature film, with good performances by Ruffalo and Watts, and an outstanding editing job of scenes...things to be expected in an Independent film.

Curran, We Don't Live Here Anymore is based on two short stories (by Andre Dubus) that chronicle infidielities committed by two married couples. Mark Ruffalo plays the role of Jack, a college professor in an unhappy marriage with Terry (Laura Dern), a rather slovenly houswife who, nonethless, loves her husband (and often yells at him) passionately. Bookending their tumultuous relationship are Edith (Naomi Watts), an ultra-neat, quiet beauty married to Hank (Peter Krause), another college professor who has a rather fluid definition of faithfulness.Jack and Edith secretly nurse an affection for each other, which they indulge. Edith knows they will get caught, but doesn't think her husband will mind. Jack, on the other hand, struggles with the idea that he may not love Terry at all anymore. Wracked with guilt, Jack practically sets Terry and Hank up on a date, then is by turns pleased (because he then feels his own infidelity is more justifiable) and horrified (because maybe part of him still loves Terry) when the two of them go to bed together.Performances in this film are of the highest quality. The arguments between Jack and Terry are cutting and often cruel, underscoring the messy nature of their relationship. Conversely, Edith and Hank seem to feel so sterilized towards each other that passion doesn't enter into the equation for them, making the ending of the film predictable but somehow ""right."" Bedroom scenes of the two married couples emphasize how, even in the act of lovemaking, oceans of distance can separate people.

None of the characters are judged as they act out and seek some way to feel they are still alive, while having to take care of their kids and the banalities of house cleaning and their petty disagreements.

Everyone I know seems to have daily train wrecks with their relationships and marriages....But then I found myself drawn in by this movie.I have a thing for Naomi Watts, I admit it, so I started watching primarily because of her, but all of the performances are excellent, even the kids.  Add to that a really insightful, tight script and you've got a great movie about how unhappy marriages sink into routine and failure--and what each husband or wife does about it.Even though I love Naomi Watts (not repeating it because I'm a deranged stalker or obsessed fan--but because I'm making a point), I have to say the most touching performance comes from Laura Dern.  It's deceptive how bland her character is at the very start because she soon becomes the character we see change the most.  She ends up becoming the heart of the movie.  I really felt for her as she snaps out of her rut to finally start being the wife/mom she needs to be and cleaning that pig pen of a house--only to discover just how far her marriage has run off the tracks.Not a false note here.

It is also true that Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting. The film as a result looks like a filmed version of some John Updike novels (actually it is based on two shorts by Andre Dubus, whose `Killings' became `In the Bedroom').But sorry, Updike is not my favorite author, and the film's touch is too desultory for me. No, `desultory' is not the only real problem because I remember I was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful `In the Bedroom.' The real flaw of `We Don't Live Here Any More' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters.Mark Ruffalo's character Jack is having affair with Naomi Watt's Edith and Jack's wife (Laura Dern) already suspects, or knows that his husband is cheating. But the affair means here uninspired, clich&eacute;d sex scenes between Edith and Jack among the woods in Oregon, with Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo having sex against a tree ala `Fatal Attraction.' Edith husband Hank (Peter Krause) teaches creative writing, and has just one book published. The alcoholism of Laura Dern's character is suggested in the most obvious way (you know what), but in the first place why didn't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big clich&eacute;?Among these recycled materials, there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention. It is the brief, but efficient study of the children in both families, and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart. These clever, insightful moments, however, do not last long in the film, for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in America.We don't want any big surprises, or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning.

'We Don't Live Here Anymore' fantastically manages to maintain our sympathies with the characters we're meant to feel for so that it isn't as distanced as it would have been had it been cold and much too fierce. The film, after all, surrounds two married couples --Jack (Mark Ruffalo) and Terry (Laura Dern), and the second, Edith (Naomi Watts) and Hank (Peter Krause)-- essentially making love with each other behind one another's backs. Some may immediately be pushed away from the subject matter for moral reasons, but three of the four central performances are so fantastic that maintaining sympathy becomes plausible. For example, Laura Dern, who gives perhaps the film's best performance, is Terry, a wife her husband Jack sees as a slob in comparison to Edith, who he is having sex with. Here, we understand how Jack and Edith's relationship is a means of catharsis for an unhappy Jack, but Dern dimensionalizes Terry to the degree that we side with her while also understanding Jack's perspective, in turn making Terry's final monologue much more effective. Terry is mad at Jack for rejecting her so easily, clearly stating in the film's third central clash between the two that she would love Jack even if he were a bum on the streets, the point being that love isn't about what you do: it's about who you are.'We Don't Live Here Anymore' consistently studies such claims in this essay-like manner: presenting a situation, studying it at all angles, and executing a specific theme with utmost precision. The film is a juxtaposition of the love of Jack and Terry, the superficiality of Edith and Hank, and each criss-crossing affair. We see them go back and forth, loving and hating, with us progressively being absorbed in the situation (a process only aided by very sensual yet secretive camera work). An important factor in 'We Don't Live Here Anymore' is the role of each child and how they react to the fighting. There are three fights the screenplay structures itself around --all of which are between Jack and Terry, and all of which have different themes-- and in between we see the dispositions and commentary of the children among other crucial scenes (the awkwardness of the four, the moments leading up to yet another clash). Director John Curran handles the children's perspective well and understands the importance of their ever-constant presence (one gains the sense that they're always there, a feeling that becomes unsettling). As a result of this combination of the adult situation and a child's emotions, 'We Don't Live Here Anymore' ends up being not simply dark histrionics, but an honest attempt at exploring what true love is and whether or not it is enough to maintain a marriage.",4,Impassioned marital drama,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,2931,"['Work', 'as', 'impassioned', ""'We"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'pushed', 'sidelines', 'cinema', 'rare', 'come', 'dramas', 'so', 'intent', 'being', 'fearless', 'exploration', 'relationship', 'darkest', 'aspects', ""'We"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'fantastically', 'maintain', 'sympathies', 'characters', ""'re"", 'meant', 'feel', 'so', ""n't"", 'as', 'distanced', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'cold', 'much', 'too', 'fierce', 'film', 'two', 'married', 'couples', 'Jack', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Terry', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'second', 'Edith', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Hank', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'essentially', 'making', 'love', 'other', 'one', 'backs', 'may', 'immediately', 'be', 'pushed', 'away', 'subject', 'matter', 'moral', 'reasons', 'three', 'four', 'central', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'fantastic', 'maintaining', 'sympathy', 'becomes', 'plausible', 'example', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'who', 'perhaps', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'Terry', 'wife', 'husband', 'Jack', 'slob', 'comparison', 'Edith', 'who', 'having', 'sex', 'Here', 'understand', 'how', 'Jack', 'Edith', 'relationship', 'means', 'catharsis', 'unhappy', 'Jack', 'Dern', 'Terry', 'degree', 'side', 'also', 'understanding', 'Jack', 'perspective', 'turn', 'making', 'Terry', 'final', 'monologue', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'Terry', 'mad', 'Jack', 'rejecting', 'so', 'easily', 'clearly', 'stating', 'film', 'third', 'central', 'clash', 'two', 'would', 'love', 'Jack', 'even', 'were', 'bum', 'streets', 'point', 'being', 'love', ""n't"", 'what', 'do', 'who', 'are', ""'We"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'consistently', 'studies', 'such', 'claims', 'essay-like', 'manner', 'presenting', 'situation', 'studying', 'angles', 'executing', 'specific', 'theme', 'utmost', 'precision', 'film', 'juxtaposition', 'love', 'Jack', 'Terry', 'superficiality', 'Edith', 'Hank', 'criss-crossing', 'affair', 'see', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'loving', 'hating', 'progressively', 'being', 'absorbed', 'situation', 'process', 'only', 'aided', 'very', 'sensual', 'yet', 'secretive', 'camera', 'work', 'important', 'factor', ""'We"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'role', 'child', 'how', 'react', 'fighting', 'are', 'three', 'fights', 'screenplay', 'around', 'are', 'Jack', 'Terry', 'have', 'different', 'themes', 'see', 'dispositions', 'commentary', 'children', 'other', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'awkwardness', 'four', 'moments', 'leading', 'up', 'yet', 'clash', 'Director', 'John', 'Curran', 'children', 'perspective', 'well', 'importance', 'ever-constant', 'presence', 'one', 'gains', 'sense', ""'re"", 'always', 'there', 'feeling', 'unsettling', 'result', 'combination', 'adult', 'situation', 'child', 'emotions', ""'We"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'up', 'being', 'not', 'simply', 'dark', 'histrionics', 'honest', 'attempt', 'exploring', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'not', 'enough', 'maintain', 'marriage']",N/A
861410,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00065HKMA,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[2, 2]","I recently saw Laura Dern in Nicolas Cage's Wild At Heart, and I was so blown away by her performance opposite her mother(Diane Ladd) and Cage. To this date, I still consider Rambling Rose is her signature movie, and she was so memorable. OK, that's enough of an intro about her. In We Don't Live Here Anymore, she's the reason that this lowkey infidelity domestic drama is more worthwhile watching, because she gave her best, and the other three leads just can't match her level of intensity.So this film is about two couples who are friends and each of the spouses are secretly sleeping around with the other. It took a while before it became obvious to the faithful spouse that their spouse were unfaithful. Mark Rufallo, Laura Dern's husband, started to have discreet encounters with Naomi Watts, who was the wife of Peter Krause, who was a good friend of Rufallo. Soon Dern figured out what was going on, and decided to get even with Rufallo by seducing Krause. When Rufallo confronted her, she got very furious, and fought back in a rage of anger. This was the scene that allowed Dern to ""explode"" in front of Rufallo, and she was incredible! So the two couples were on the verge of divorce or forgiveness and reconcilation....Naomi Watts was pretty good, but she's still got a long way to go compared to Dern, and her character is rather unlikeable. I prefer to see her screaming at Samara in The Ring or doing a bikini ad in I Heart Huckubees.Peter Krause is less aggressive than Rufallo in this film. Somehow I couldn't stop thinking how alike he looks to Jim Carrey in The Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.Mark Rufallo is slowly shedding his You Can Count On Me image by doing a bad husband role in this film and a sexualized bad cop in In The Cut(Meg Ryan). He tried very hard as far as performance is concerned, by it's not his forte to be on the dark side.",4,Laura Dern gives her best reaction to infidelity.,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1874,"['recently', 'saw', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Wild', 'Heart', 'was', 'so', 'blown', 'away', 'performance', 'mother', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'Cage', 'date', 'still', 'consider', 'Rambling', 'Rose', 'signature', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'memorable', 'OK', 'enough', 'intro', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'reason', 'lowkey', 'infidelity', 'domestic', 'drama', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'watching', 'gave', 'best', 'other', 'three', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'level', 'intensity.So', 'film', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'spouses', 'are', 'secretly', 'sleeping', 'other', 'took', 'while', 'became', 'obvious', 'faithful', 'spouse', 'spouse', 'were', 'unfaithful', 'Mark', 'Rufallo', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'husband', 'started', 'have', 'discreet', 'encounters', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'was', 'wife', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'friend', 'Rufallo', 'Soon', 'Dern', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'decided', 'get', 'even', 'Rufallo', 'seducing', 'Krause', 'When', 'Rufallo', 'confronted', 'got', 'very', 'furious', 'fought', 'back', 'rage', 'anger', 'was', 'scene', 'allowed', 'Dern', 'explode', 'front', 'Rufallo', 'was', 'incredible', 'So', 'two', 'couples', 'were', 'verge', 'divorce', 'forgiveness', 'reconcilation', '.Naomi', 'Watts', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'still', 'got', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'compared', 'Dern', 'character', 'rather', 'unlikeable', 'prefer', 'see', 'screaming', 'Samara', 'Ring', 'doing', 'bikini', 'ad', 'Heart', 'Huckubees.Peter', 'Krause', 'less', 'aggressive', 'Rufallo', 'film', 'Somehow', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'how', 'alike', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind.Mark', 'Rufallo', 'slowly', 'shedding', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'image', 'doing', 'bad', 'husband', 'role', 'film', 'sexualized', 'bad', 'cop', 'Cut', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'as', 'far', 'performance', 'concerned', 'not', 'forte', 'be', 'dark', 'side']",N/A
861411,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00065HKMA,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","There's this movie titled ""Dinner with Friends"" with Greg Kinnear, Andie Macdowell, Dennis Quaid, and Toni Collette which addresses marriage, and divorce, and one which I thought portrayed all the angst and strife that can afflict couples that have been together for a while. Well, ""We Don't Live Here Anymore"" does this too, but in a more honest and credible way. At heart it explores the issue of infidelity and dissatisfaction in marriages, as portrayed by two couples who also happen to be close friends. Hank and Edith (Peter Krause and Naomi Watts) & Jack and Terry (Mark Ruffalo and Laura Dern) are good friends who are unhappy in their respective marriages. Hank and Jack are both lecturers in a local community college (filming was in Vancouver, BC) and Hank seems to be experiencing a serious case of writer's block whilst Jack takes time off for the summer. Of the four main characters, I felt Hank was the most unsympathetic character, portraying a guy who is distant and aloof from his pretty wife Edith (Watts), and also a serial adulterer. Edith finds herself stuck in a marriage that does not give her any sense of happiness,yet unwilling to do anything about it, choosing instead to reach out to Jack (Ruffalo) who reciprocates, resulting in a torrid affair (they make it everywhere - in the car, in the woods, in Edith's house whilst Hank sleeps upstairs!). Jack, seems disconnected from his own wife, and rebuffs her attempts at reconnecting, and rediscovering whatever it was that drew them together in the first place.This movie is basically about a couple of 'lost' souls - each individual is searching for some form of fulfillment, and not really attaining it. Laura Dern's Terry was the character I empathized with the most, and Dern pours her heart and soul into her portrayal of a sad and frustrated housewife who tries to desperately reach out to and reconnect with her distant husband. Ruffalo also does a credible job of playing a man who is so consumed with his need for Edith that he totally alienates his wife, ignorant of her needs, whilst struggling with the moral dilemma of his affair (yet unwilling to stop it). Watts shines as a woman who has so much to give yet is trapped in a loveless marriage. The sex scenes are portrayed in a brutally honest manner - ironically, it is not the scenes of adulterous sex that are hard to watch. On the contrary, the sex that Edith and Jack engage in may be animalistic but it also shows two people who are in true harmony with each other. In contrast, the marital sex that Edith and Hank engage in, as well as Terry and Jack, appear almost awkward and perfunctory - made glaringly and painfully obvious with the desperate plea by Terry in one sex scene with Jack ""Look at me"" she cries out repeatedly.The pacing of the movie is just right - drawing viewers in as we get to know these flawed and conflicted characters, watching the marital dramas unfold against a backdrop of suspicion, guilt, anger, frustration - in short, all of the emotions that many couples experience in their relationships. This movie provides an honest and unflinching look at the unraveling of two marriages, the emotional cost of infidelity, and the compromises that people make in relationships.",5,Honest and unflinching look at marriage and infidelity,1256342400,"10 24, 2009",2009,3247,"['movie', 'titled', 'Dinner', 'Friends', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Andie', 'Macdowell', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'marriage', 'divorce', 'one', 'thought', 'portrayed', 'angst', 'strife', 'can', 'afflict', 'couples', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'while', 'Well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'too', 'more', 'honest', 'credible', 'way', 'heart', 'issue', 'infidelity', 'dissatisfaction', 'marriages', 'portrayed', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'close', 'friends', 'Hank', 'Edith', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Jack', 'Terry', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'unhappy', 'respective', 'marriages', 'Hank', 'Jack', 'are', 'lecturers', 'local', 'community', 'college', 'filming', 'was', 'Vancouver', 'BC', 'Hank', 'be', 'experiencing', 'serious', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'whilst', 'Jack', 'time', 'off', 'summer', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'felt', 'Hank', 'was', 'most', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'portraying', 'guy', 'who', 'distant', 'aloof', 'pretty', 'wife', 'Edith', 'Watts', 'also', 'serial', 'adulterer', 'Edith', 'stuck', 'marriage', 'not', 'give', 'sense', 'happiness', 'yet', 'unwilling', 'do', 'anything', 'choosing', 'instead', 'reach', 'out', 'Jack', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'resulting', 'torrid', 'affair', 'make', 'everywhere', 'car', 'woods', 'Edith', 'house', 'whilst', 'Hank', 'sleeps', 'upstairs', 'Jack', 'disconnected', 'own', 'wife', 'attempts', 'reconnecting', 'rediscovering', 'whatever', 'was', 'drew', 'together', 'first', 'place.This', 'movie', 'basically', 'couple', ""'lost"", 'souls', 'individual', 'searching', 'form', 'fulfillment', 'not', 'really', 'attaining', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Terry', 'was', 'character', 'empathized', 'most', 'Dern', 'heart', 'soul', 'portrayal', 'sad', 'frustrated', 'housewife', 'who', 'desperately', 'reach', 'out', 'reconnect', 'distant', 'husband', 'Ruffalo', 'also', 'credible', 'job', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'consumed', 'need', 'Edith', 'totally', 'wife', 'ignorant', 'needs', 'whilst', 'struggling', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'affair', 'yet', 'unwilling', 'stop', 'Watts', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'give', 'yet', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'portrayed', 'brutally', 'honest', 'manner', 'ironically', 'not', 'scenes', 'adulterous', 'sex', 'are', 'hard', 'watch', 'contrary', 'sex', 'Edith', 'Jack', 'engage', 'may', 'be', 'animalistic', 'also', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'true', 'harmony', 'other', 'contrast', 'marital', 'sex', 'Edith', 'Hank', 'engage', 'as', 'well', 'Terry', 'Jack', 'appear', 'almost', 'awkward', 'perfunctory', 'made', 'glaringly', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'desperate', 'plea', 'Terry', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'Jack', 'Look', 'out', 'repeatedly.The', 'pacing', 'movie', 'just', 'right', 'drawing', 'viewers', 'get', 'know', 'flawed', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'watching', 'marital', 'dramas', 'unfold', 'backdrop', 'suspicion', 'guilt', 'anger', 'frustration', 'short', 'emotions', 'many', 'couples', 'experience', 'relationships', 'movie', 'honest', 'unflinching', 'look', 'unraveling', 'two', 'marriages', 'emotional', 'cost', 'infidelity', 'compromises', 'people', 'make', 'relationships']",N/A
