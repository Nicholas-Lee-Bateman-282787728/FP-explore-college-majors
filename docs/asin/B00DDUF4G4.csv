1655343,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00DDUF4G4,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 2]","It used to be that more and more students headed toward college wanted to study journalism.  And why not?  Who wouldn&#8217;t want a job where you were paid well to spend a great deal of your time speaking with people?  That isn&#8217;t meant as an insult.  As one who briefly considered journalism myself many moons ago, I can certainly appreciate the hard work it takes to crack any story, let alone one that&#8217;ll make headlines.  However, the newspaper business ain&#8217;t what it used to be, as they say, so less and less interest seems to be heading that way.The world of ANNIKA BENGTZON might confuse you.  There&#8217;s still an awful lot and glamor and glitz associated to print media.  Though her paper is part of a larger media conglomerate, methinks there&#8217;s still a healthy amount of cynicism viewers should use in viewing her responsibilities as an ace crime reporter.  No doubt, Bengtzon is the exception to the rule; the rule itself is a dying business.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Odds are that, if you&#8217;re here reading this, then you&#8217;re familiar with the Swedish series focusing on an intrepid crime reporter &#8211; the lovely Annika Bengtzon (as played by the equally lovely Malin Crepin) &#8211; as she goes about trying to not only report on the &#8216;wrongs&#8217; but see them &#8216;righted.&#8217;  Not only that, but the show gives more than just passing lip service to her other roles in life, that of a mother and a wife.  All that&#8217;s really left then is for me to detail to some lesser degree how well each installment here works.  For the record, there are three of them: a good one, a great one, and &#8230; well &#8230; not so good.&#8220;The Red Wolf&#8221; (3 of 5 stars): Bengtzon is drawn into the murder of a fellow journalist who had nurtured a long-time conspiracy theory involving a locally famous terrorist attack from thirty years ago.  Suffice it to say, his demise means he was definitely on to something, and Bengtzon races against time to expose a decades old cover-up before yesterday&#8217;s Leftists become today&#8217;s ruling elite.  It&#8217;s a good story &#8211; a bit dreary in tones and setting compared to what&#8217;s come before in this series &#8211; and, frankly, it&#8217;s all a bit muddled come the ending.  Our reporter does suffer a pretty intense beat down in the finale, but &#8211; ever the trooper &#8211; she&#8217;s get back up and still manages to save the day.  (I found that a bit hard to swallow.)&#8220;Lifetime&#8221; (5 of 5 stars): Of all the Bengtzon procedurals I&#8217;ve seen, this is by far my favorite.  It has everything, and that&#8217;s precisely because it allows so many smaller storylines that have been hanging on &#8211; Annika&#8217;s failed marriage, Annika&#8217;s questionable role as a mother, Annika&#8217;s obsession with her work, etc. &#8211; to come to a head.  What looks like a celebrity murder turns out to have even darker secrets in wait, and our reporter must rely on the assistance of an inexperienced female officer in order to break through some procedural red tape and get to the truth.  What she learns will force her to re-evaluate how she&#8217;s lived her life thus far, and it&#8217;ll also put her on a path toward (possibly) a brighter tomorrow.&#8220;A Place in the Sun&#8221; (2 of 5 stars): Unfortunately, that &#8216;brighter tomorrow&#8217; I spoke of above all turned out to be a bit of a well-structured creative ruse as Bengtzon is sent off to Costa del Sol, Spain, to investigate the high-profile murder of a former Swedish hockey great.  What looks like a burglary gone horribly wrong quickly becomes something else, and the reporter will be forced to travel into some very dark places in order to piece together what really happened.  For all of its nice moments (great setting, nice romantic subplot, and even the hint of a reconciliation of sorts with her ex-husband) falls apart in the story&#8217;s last 15 minutes with a stunningly ridiculous development in the whodunit department.  Suffice it to say, this &#8216;place&#8217; stretched credibility too far to ever be recovered.ANNIKA BENGTZON, CRIME REPORTER: EPISODES 4-6 [2012] is produced by Yellow Bird Films, Degeto Film, TV4 Nordisk Television, Nordisk Film, and Filmpool Nord.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by MHZ Networks.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, here you go: this is a Swedish spoken language release with English subtitles available.  (No, there is no English dubbed track.)  As for the technical specifications, I&#8217;m increasingly impressed with the quality of the sight and sound that goes into BENGTZON; it&#8217;s nothing short of incredible, though some of the shooting locations this time around were far from the glamor of past installments.  Sadly &#8211; as is too often the case when these foreign productions find release on American shores &#8211; there are no special features to speak of.  (Shame on you, Sweden!  For shame!)RECOMMENDED.  For all practical intents, I&#8217;d encourage you definitely to check out &#8220;The Red Wolf&#8221; and &#8220;Lifetime,&#8221; but I&#8217;m really struggling with giving &#8220;A Place in the Sun&#8221; even a weak recommendation.  Arguably, it&#8217;s the best produced of the three, but it has the weakest narrative because too much of it is centered entirely on coincidences.  In the world of hard reporting, coincidences of this magnitude don&#8217;t take place; when they rear their ugly heads in quality fiction, they usually spell certain doom.  Skip it &#8230; unless you&#8217;d like to see Malin Crepin&#8217;s assets (briefly) on display.  At least, there is that highpoint.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MHz Networks provided me with a DVD copy of ANNIKA BENGTZON, CRIME REPORTER: THE

1655345,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DDUF4G4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 7]","To be frank, I was nearly put off watching ""Annika Bengtzon: Crime Reporter"" for the title alone. I was afraid the series would feel too young, too on the nose, because the name made me anticipate a sort of Nancy Drew vibe. I'm pleased to say that this set of stories from Sweden is, indeed, a stylish entertainment for adults. As witnessed by the slate of popular procedural programs on network television, we can't get enough of solving crime! I really enjoy having the opportunity to sample International programs, and the handsomely produced mystery series ""Annika Bengtzon: Crime Reporter"" deserves to be discovered by a larger worldwide audience. The series has a great cast, interesting location shooting, and a strong central character. It looks and feels expensive, and it held my interest as I watched all of the episodes over a two day period. The series currently consists of six self-contained adventures of about 90 minutes each (some a bit more plausible than others) and is being sold in two different sets of three.Note on pricing: As of this review, the current non-sale and subject to change price for each of these sets is 39.95. That means to watch the entire series, it is an eighty dollar expenditure. Although I recommend the series, I'd watch for sale pricing as this seems extreme for nine hours of programming.""Annika Bengtzon: Crime Reporter"" adheres to the conventions of the genre (both good and bad) but adds enough flavor to Bengtzon's workplace and home life to keep things progressing on an interesting character arc. And this series of movies is largely sold by its leading lady Malin Cr&eacute;pin. Bengtzon can certainly be a frustrating heroine, but Cr&eacute;pin keeps us involved even when she's being silly. She is the quintessential news hungry reporter, usually in the right place at the right time. Needless to say, this reporter doesn't just cover the news--she becomes a part of it. It is easy to become exasperated with the series as Bengtzon repeatedly puts herself in harm's way. She is obsessed with work and this creates waves with her significant other (an appealing Richard Ulfs&auml;ter). Although it seems like we're supposed to side with the heroine in matters domestic, he is a virtual saint in early episodes to put up with her lack of familial commitment. Then, all of a sudden, she's supposed to be a committed mother when the plot dictates. Heck, she might have died a dozen times in these six episodes alone and is always abandoning the little ones!The Three Episodes on this set of 4-6:4) The Red Wolf: (3 Stars): When the Annika series gets into deep conspiracy mode, it is at its most outlandish. This revolves around a murder from forty years prior on a military base. An obsessed journalist is murdered and Annika wants to know what new information might be the cause. This leads to a string of murders and Annika endlessly throwing caution to the wind and being foolhardy.5) Lifetime: (4 1/2 Stars): Probably my second favorite episode, this gets off with a gruesome crime. A cop is brutally shot, his wife has lost her mind and their child has disappeared. Working with a young officer, Annika starts to unravel corruption within the force that reaches unexpected heights.6) A Place In The Sun (3 1/2 Stars): In this episode, Annika is off to Spain (dressed like a homeless person) to investigate the high profile death of a major Swedish sports star. Loved the setting, but the case involves hired murderers, illicit drugs, and real estate fraud. One of the bigger stories, but Annika's single handed charge into Morocco is one of the series most preposterous moments.

Beautiful young crime reporter with lovely family, but who has an obsession with nosing out the most muderous anddangerous crimes and not only writing them up for her byline in her newspaper but dashing headlong into danger single-handedly, after which she comes out -- unscathed! And not even dirty.The plots are uneven in quality. Some go by so fast I barely remember them. The characters also don't seem to have a scratch on them after a scuffle, leaving a bit of a surfacy, or cartoonish, sense and not a realistic one.'Production values' are high: sets, locations,  and cinematography. Actors are all good. So directing is good. It's the stories that could use more imagination and plausibility.I was kept watching by the evolving story of Annika's family, particularly her husband. Her kids as actors are equal to the other crew members. At her work I kept looking out for Annika's cohort, an older woman, who, as a character has first-hand history Annika doesn't have, helps her selflessly with research,  and is an excellent actor.At work, as with the police, we don't see sexism. Respect is always welcome.The episodes become repetitive and predictable. A murder happens. Annika abandons family plans and runs to cover it, gets in as deeply as she can, sees a plot snag that needs to be untangled or rushes in to save someone, 'almost gets killed', gets saved at the most breathless moment by the police (who share information with herfor the most part freely). Again, if Annika has been just been ruthlessly kicked by a criminal she nonetheless gets up and saves the day and her body shows no signs of wear.I like series which change and move the character along in her life, a bigger story within which the episodic stories are contained. But there is not much of a macrostory, just self-contained episodes -- plus family.

Each story is complete in itself, the threads that runs through them being the newspaper's staff and Bengtzon and her personal life. Filmed in Sweden with a Swedish cast (and thus with English subtitles), the series features excellent cinematography and high production values.

We are used to police of all genre involved in the mysteries, now we have a journalist who is a crime reporter who is solving the crimes.Based on the crime novels by Liza Marklund, this series follows Annika Bengtzon, played by Malin Cr&eacute;pin. She is a reporter for a Swedish newspaper, Kv&auml;llspressen. She is a dedicated reporter and loves her work. At the same time, she is married with two small children. The entire family is good looking, and everyone is vying for Annika's attention. Her bosses want her work, now, and her family wants her at home. We are treated to three interesting and sometimes engrossing episodes in this set. Annika is thwarted at every turn either by her family, her bosses or the police. But she is able to get around them, and in doing so, brings us along for the ride. The storylines are well done, but seem familiar. Filmed in Sweden with a Swedish cast, the series features excellent cinematography and production values. The stories are interesting; the time devoted to Bengtzon's pursuit of the story and the effect of her career on her personal life is well balanced; and the cast, especially Malin Cr&eacute;pin as Bengtzon, are effective.The continuing story of her marriage and her life as a mother make Annika a much fuller character. Like the best of series, there is both an episode resolution and continuing character development. The show does an excellent job at showing how difficult a woman's working life can be. I found the second 3 episodes to b far more interesting and compelling than the first three episodes.Recommended. prisrob 03-22-14",4,Journalistic Experience,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,1717,"['Scandinavian', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'are', 'forte', 'love', 'new', 'DVD', 'series', 'Sweden', 'promising', 'beginning', 'are', 'used', 'police', 'genre', 'involved', 'mysteries', 'now', 'have', 'journalist', 'who', 'crime', 'reporter', 'who', 'solving', 'crimes.Based', 'crime', 'novels', 'Liza', 'Marklund', 'series', 'Annika', 'Bengtzon', 'played', 'Malin', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'pin', 'reporter', 'Swedish', 'newspaper', 'Kv', 'auml', 'llspressen', 'dedicated', 'reporter', 'work', 'same', 'time', 'married', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'entire', 'family', 'good', 'looking', 'everyone', 'vying', 'Annika', 'attention', 'bosses', 'want', 'work', 'now', 'family', 'home', 'are', 'treated', 'three', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'engrossing', 'episodes', 'set', 'Annika', 'thwarted', 'turn', 'family', 'bosses', 'police', 'able', 'get', 'doing', 'so', 'ride', 'storylines', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'seem', 'familiar', 'Filmed', 'Sweden', 'Swedish', 'cast', 'series', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'production', 'values', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'time', 'devoted', 'Bengtzon', 'pursuit', 'story', 'effect', 'career', 'personal', 'life', 'well', 'balanced', 'cast', 'especially', 'Malin', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'Bengtzon', 'are', 'effective.The', 'continuing', 'story', 'marriage', 'life', 'mother', 'make', 'Annika', 'much', 'fuller', 'character', 'best', 'series', 'episode', 'resolution', 'continuing', 'character', 'development', 'show', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'difficult', 'woman', 'working', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'second', '3', 'episodes', 'b', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'first', 'three', 'episodes.Recommended', 'prisrob', '03-22-14']","Annika Bengtzon, Crime Reporter: Episodes 4-6"
