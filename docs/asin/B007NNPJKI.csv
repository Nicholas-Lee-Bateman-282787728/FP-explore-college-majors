Words cannot express my dislike of this film.  Even a musical needs a coherent plot of some kind, but IKaV had none.  The music was mediocre at best, the villain not really villainous, and the production value felt just one step higher than what some friends would do in their garage.  The vocal talent wasn't too far off though.  Still, save your money, save your time, and save yourselves.",1,"I Want my 90 Minutes Back, With Interest",1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,514,"['vein', 'high', 'school', 'musical', 'was', 'what', 'description', 'said', 'thought', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'was', 'wrong', 'Words', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'dislike', 'film', 'Even', 'musical', 'coherent', 'plot', 'kind', 'IKaV', 'had', 'none', 'music', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'villain', 'not', 'really', 'villainous', 'production', 'value', 'felt', 'just', 'one', 'step', 'higher', 'what', 'friends', 'would', 'do', 'garage', 'vocal', 'talent', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'Still', 'save', 'money', 'save', 'time', 'save', 'yourselves']",N/A

1534953,AWNR5E6OSM0DY,B007NNPJKI,Desi,"[1, 1]","Just got done watching this film and I have to say its definately geared towards a younger audience. I would say anyone between the ages of 12 and 18 would probably like this movie better then a more older audience. But I have to say went into this movie not expecting anything great. But sense it was a musical and had vampires in it I deceided to check it out. I actually liked it, surprizingly, even though I'm not in the 12-18 age group. The story, plot and characters needed to be more developed. I felt like the film moved at such a fast pace that whoever wrote it fogot the developing part. The music was pretty good. Even if the lyrics were corny. The dancing left something to be desired. I liked the gothic settings. I give this film a three out of five stars.",3,I kissed a vampire,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,770,"['Just', 'got', 'done', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'definately', 'geared', 'towards', 'younger', 'audience', 'would', 'say', 'anyone', 'ages', '12', '18', 'would', 'probably', 'movie', 'better', 'then', 'more', 'older', 'audience', 'have', 'say', 'went', 'movie', 'not', 'expecting', 'anything', 'great', 'sense', 'was', 'musical', 'had', 'vampires', 'deceided', 'check', 'out', 'actually', 'liked', 'surprizingly', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', '12-18', 'age', 'group', 'story', 'plot', 'characters', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'developed', 'felt', 'film', 'moved', 'fast', 'pace', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'fogot', 'developing', 'part', 'music', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Even', 'lyrics', 'were', 'corny', 'dancing', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'liked', 'gothic', 'settings', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

Couldnt get past the first 30 minutes.  Maybe if I was a 14 year old I would find it great.
