1068528,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,B000P5FH2Q,Casey62,"[4, 9]","As a die-hard fan of LAND OF THE GIANTS, I'm not going to complain about the price of this set because I'm just glad it's finally out and looking better than ever, transferred from sharp, 35mm prints with beautiful color saturation. In addition to the pristine looking episodes, the extras include cast interviews, a network sales pitch, behind the scenes footage, publicity photos, photo cards, a comic book repro, mini booklet, spaceship key chain, and a crew patch. To top it off, everything comes housed in a cool box cage that captures the spirit of the show. I can ony give this DVD set the highest recommendation to all serious GIANTS devotees.For those unfamiliar with the show, here's the lowdown:A sub-orbital spaceflight en-route from Los Angeles to London passes through a dimensional space warp and crash lands on a planet inhabited by giants. The crew and passengers must work together if they hope to survive, repair their spaceship, and someday return to Earth. In the process they learn that the giants have a totalitarian form of government in which the Earthlings are sought out as enemy aliens whose advanced technology poses a threat to the giants.LAND OF THE GIANTS is a classic that holds up extremely well today. Among the popular Irwin Allen T.V. shows of the 60's - VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, LOST IN SPACE, and THE TIME TUNNEL - GIANTS was the most ambitious and stands out as the best of the lot. It was the most expensive series up to that time, employing production values and special effects usually reserved for feature films. The high cost was the reason it was cancelled after its initial 1968-70 run, but the show remained popular in syndication over the years and has gained new generations of fans. It all speaks for the high quality of GIANTS.The attractive cast performs engagingly; each actor approaches his/her role with a sincere earnestness that makes them easily likable. There is also a lot more ad-libbing than in Allen's other shows, which makes the dialog delivery feel natural and spontaneous. The characters contain an adequate measure of depth that is in keeping within the framework of what is essentially an action based show. Throughout the various episodes, each cast member is given their chance to dominate the plot.Obviously in a science fiction show, the special effects play a prominent role and LAND OF THE GIANTS provided an elaborate showcase for them. GIANTS is a veritable visual feast with lush, Technicolor photography and expertly constructed props that are twelve times larger than normal. The extreme low angle shots of the giants required that the sets have ceilings built into them, something other shows didn't have to bother with. On the other hand, the extreme high angle shots of the ""little people"" needed a very wide soundstage that was often an artificial, oversized forest or the bottom portion of an office room furnished with enormous props. To further simulate gigantic proportions, various in-camera techniques were utilized such as large and miniature rear projection, split screen photography, travelling mattes, and forced perspective. Even in our CGI era the expertise of 20th Century Fox's special effects department still impresses, especially since such high standards had to be maintained on a weekly basis.Music was always a major contributing factor to the quality of Irwin Allen's T.V. shows, and the score for GIANTS is exemplary. Full bodied and vibrant, the music matches the impact of the visuals and heightens the feeling of suspense and impending danger. The powerful brass section gives the show a genuine, giant-like atmosphere. This comes off particularly well in the opening title theme for the first season and in the pilot episode, THE CRASH.Something else that greatly works to LAND OF THE GIANTS' advantage is that it sticks to its basic premise and doesn't try to copy STAR TREK. It also never resorts to silliness like LOST IN SPACE often does. GIANTS is a bit darker in tone with a distinctly paranoid feel. There's also a certain eerieness, particularly in some of the first season episodes where the giants move lethargically and scarcely talk. Whenever the show addresses an ""issue"" it is never in an overt or pretentious way. Science fiction themes that deal with time travel or cloning are always handled intelligently. Mostly though, the episodes are about the difficulties and dangers one would encounter in a hostile world of giants. This served the show well, giving it a universal appeal that hasn't dated. Indeed, LAND OF THE GIANTS is a cult favorite in several European countries with a substantial fanbase in England.As a six year old, I was lucky enough to see it when it made its debut in 1968 and I was immediately captivated and enthralled by it. It had aspects that were familiar as I've seen and loved Irwin Allen's other shows, but there was also something excitingly fresh and different - it was a show that just looked, sounded, and felt BIG. I have to say that after all these years none of that has diminished, and now with DVD, LAND OF THE GIANTS is still a terrifically fun place to visit over and over again.",5,GIGANTIC

I have reviewed over a hundred projects on Amazon and am a regular book reviewer for our local paper so I am aware that the reader (or in this case the viewer) should really have seen the book or DVD set from beginning to end before making a judgement. Therefore I feel guilty about making a commentary so early in the game.However, the three star rating listed with this product on Amazon may seem to some like an indictment of the show.  Not the price.  I have seen all the episodes many times and love the show.  One who has not seen the show could be turned off once they see that three star rating and not bother with reading the reasons for the rating.Most reviewers have so far dealt with the price, which is high I agree.  That didn't prevent me from ordering it as I considered it a great series, better than any of the others by Irwin and one of the best all time shows on television.  Sadly none of the original cast gets a dime for this.  I don't want to take a chance on Fox pulling the product due to criticism and selling only what they have on hand.While the price is high, I also know there are collectors who will pay any price for something they really want.  I recently returned from AdventureCon, a large toy and comic show in Tennessee.  I saw collector cards going for three and four hundred dollars each from various TV shows.  People  were buying them.  I also feel lucky I found my Giants lunch box for fifteen dollars in a flea market as I have seen them priced for $200.00 to $400.00. And they do sell at that price.  I confess I have too often paid more for things than I should.I am puzzled by the price on the Giants set just as so many of you are.  I just paid much less for the first two seasons of Veronica Mars with extras.  Many of you have bought whole season sets for less I know.  I have complete sets of several shows, Sliders, Smallville, Wonder Woman, Home Improvement etc..  Land of the Giants is the one I have wanted most.  So I had to budget my fan buying for this set, it will be worth it to me.The reason I sound off like this is because the star system runs one to five and there is no indication whether that rating is for the product, the show or the price.  LOTG has only three and to the new buyer on Amazon this could imply the quality of the show.  I gave it five stars because of the series and what it meant to me.",5,Reviewing the project and not the price.,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,2449,"['am', 'violating', 'reviewer', 'rule', 'writing', 'what', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'seen', 'have', 'reviewed', 'hundred', 'projects', 'Amazon', 'am', 'regular', 'book', 'reviewer', 'local', 'paper', 'am', 'aware', 'reader', 'case', 'viewer', 'should', 'really', 'have', 'seen', 'book', 'DVD', 'set', 'beginning', 'end', 'making', 'judgement', 'feel', 'guilty', 'making', 'commentary', 'so', 'early', 'game.However', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'listed', 'product', 'Amazon', 'may', 'seem', 'indictment', 'show', 'Not', 'price', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'many', 'times', 'love', 'show', 'One', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'see', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'not', 'bother', 'reading', 'reasons', 'rating.Most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'dealt', 'price', 'high', 'agree', 'did', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'ordering', 'considered', 'great', 'series', 'better', 'others', 'Irwin', 'one', 'best', 'time', 'television', 'Sadly', 'none', 'original', 'cast', 'dime', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'chance', 'Fox', 'pulling', 'product', 'due', 'criticism', 'selling', 'only', 'what', 'have', 'price', 'high', 'also', 'know', 'are', 'collectors', 'who', 'will', 'pay', 'price', 'something', 'really', 'want', 'recently', 'returned', 'AdventureCon', 'large', 'toy', 'comic', 'show', 'Tennessee', 'saw', 'collector', 'cards', 'going', 'three', 'four', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'various', 'TV', 'shows', 'People', 'were', 'buying', 'also', 'feel', 'lucky', 'found', 'Giants', 'lunch', 'box', 'fifteen', 'dollars', 'flea', 'market', 'have', 'seen', 'priced', '200.00', '400.00', 'do', 'sell', 'price', 'confess', 'have', 'too', 'often', 'paid', 'more', 'things', 'should.I', 'am', 'puzzled', 'price', 'Giants', 'set', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'just', 'paid', 'much', 'less', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'extras', 'Many', 'have', 'bought', 'whole', 'season', 'sets', 'less', 'know', 'have', 'complete', 'sets', 'several', 'shows', 'Sliders', 'Smallville', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'etc..', 'Land', 'Giants', 'one', 'have', 'wanted', 'most', 'So', 'had', 'budget', 'fan', 'buying', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'me.The', 'reason', 'sound', 'off', 'star', 'system', 'one', 'five', 'indication', 'rating', 'product', 'show', 'price', 'LOTG', 'only', 'three', 'new', 'buyer', 'Amazon', 'could', 'imply', 'quality', 'show', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'series', 'what', 'meant']",Land of the Giants: The Full Series
1068540,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B000P5FH2Q,Edmonson,"[5, 5]","The ""Land of the Giants"" TV series ran for two seasons, from September 1968 to September 1970. It was set in the then-future of 1983 telling the tale of a crew and passengers in a sub-orbital transport spaceship (the Spindrift) which was en route from Los Angeles to London via an ultra-fast parabolic trajectory that would take the ship temporarily into space. But when the spaceship encounters a strange space storm they are transported to a mysterious planet where everything is much larger than on earth, where the civilization is run by a totalitarian government with inhabitants that look humanoid. This was one of the most interesting TV series from the 1960s and was produced by Irwin Allen (Lost in Space).The ""Land of the Giants"" limited edition set comes in a sturdy wooden cage that resembles a mice cage. The 9 DVDs are in 5 slim dvd cases that slip easily into wooden slots so they ship fully protected. Each DVD is secured into each side of its slim plastic DVD case so none of the discs touch. The discs are double sided. Included are all 51 episodes as well as the unaired pilot episode. The episodes look very good as they are crisp and clean with deep blacks, and have apparently been remastered. Also included is a miniature reproduction of the original comic book, a cast interview booklet, a crew patch, postcards, and a keychain. Special features include cast interviews.

However the package is stamped as a limited edition which means that the series might be re-issued in individual packages like the other Irwin Allen shows after a while, but who knows. My guess is that a good part of the price is simply the packaging. The extra's are not a big deal, but this is the stuff you get with limited editions, so if you think it's to high you may want to wait it out and one of two things can happen. Either they re-issue it later at a lower price or not at all. It's anyone's guess.I've checked some of the discs and I own the original Columbia House DVD's as well, and these look better than what Columbia released. The picture quality is excellent! That said there is a problem that another reviewer mentioned, and that is the first 3 episodes of the second season have the wrong theme music on them. 'The Mechanical Man' 'Six Hours to Live' and 'The Inside Rail' all have 2nd season intro's with the 1st season music. These episodes are available on the Columbia House versions and the intro's on those discs are correct.Except for that, I've found that these discs play well and look good, but I've still to see the entire run. Except for the price, this is not a bad set and if you can get it cheap I recommend it.Note: Land of the Giants is best enjoyed in production order rather than broadcast order. These discs as well as others always list the shows in broadcast order and often the network that originally aired the show (abc) screwed up the order terribly. I'm a long time Irwin Allen fan and I know he is not the best at character development or continuity, but what little there is is lost when the episodes are run out of order.Try this: The first 5 episodes should run like this - 'The Crash' 'The Weird-World' 'The Trip' 'The Bounty Hunter' and 'The Golden Cage.' The character of Mark especially changes gradually and you see them slowly adapting to there new surroundings. Because the series was originally aired out of order the second episode 'Ghost Town' is way out of place. It is actually the 14th episode!If you are a die hard fan this doesn't matter, but if you only marginally like the show try watching it in production order.

The restoration job was evidently made with great care (the same goes for the ""Time Tunnel"" sets).Seeing it now, I realized how amazing this show really was for its time. The episodes are 50 minutes-long. Special effects were the best of the Irwin Allen shows. And boy, the cast really works here! Always running, climbing, dodging.Of course, this is a typical action show of the 60s. Character development is close to zero. Once the heroes fall on the other dimension, each episode is an action-paced feast. You'll never see on of them longing for a relative from Earth, or parents, wives, whatever. And, unfortuantely, like many old shows, it was cancelled abruptely, so there is no closure. Poor Captain Burton and friends must be trapped in the other dimension until today...Acting is top notch, both by the ensemble cast or the giants.As for the release of this show only in this limited edition form, I don't care.

I gave it 4 stars for the long term price gouging.However, today it dropped 60 do11ars to 121 so I did order it. Much more reasonable. As long as it has dropped to this rate, I recommend buying this set. I just received it so I can only describe the unique packaging as I looked through this limited collectors edition. I now understand why the prices were so far out of whack with other DVD sets.This is the most unusual DVD packaging I have ever seen. A real wood box with a sliding front with wire and what looks like a pressed tin lunch box image of the cast behind the wire to look like they are trapped inside the box. The set includes a shoulder patch, Key chain, photos and a mini comic book. The DVD cases are slid into slots inside the wood box. This is where the problem is. The plastic cases warp without support in the middle, thus the DVD's pop out and the package wont stay closed as the warping increases. The cover and photos are all artificially distressed to look like this is a very old antique. It was very convincing design... but not practical... however, it isn't uncomon to see these types of plastic cases for DVD's. Especially for TV series. Nearly all of this type of cases had the same problem of the DVD's popping loose and allowing them to slide around inside the case and become damaged....but if they jack the price back up again to the outrageous level it was... then you should boycott it until reason has been restored. This packaging may look antique but it is only a 2007 release and the packaging is not conducive to protecting the DVD's from damage. As customers, you do have the power to pressure outrageous pricing by refusing to buy. If they can't sell it at those prices... then they accomplish nothing by trying to pillage the public.Don't let shill commenters affect your purchasing either. Sellers, including Amaz0n themselves, will have employees, friends and relatives place ""staged"" commentaries to alter your purchasing habits... especially when they try to make you feel like it is your last chance to get something... the sellers do NOT control manufacturing or quantity of product availability.Be especially suspicious of any commenters who attack another reviewer for warning about crooked dealings from sellers such as price jacking and other underhanded tricks. It is usually the seller behind attacks on reviewers who are trying to warn the public...However, at the current 121, it is a good time to buy the Land of the Giants. Get it while you can at this lower price... but be careful on checkout to make sure the price has not increased between the time you placed it in your cart and the time you check out. I had Amaz0n pull this on me on another TV series... by 75 dollars in less than an hour. It was deliberate but I caught it at the last minute and cancelled it.

1068564,A83VFWZVHIJ79,B000P5FH2Q,"Peter Karsten ""Osiris""","[2, 3]","1960's American television was an exciting time, especially for science fiction; in England we had `Doctor Who' from 1963-1969, and continuing beyond, The Thunderbirds from 1965-1966, which also spawned two movies and UFO 1969-1970, (three most notable) in Australia we had `Phoenix Five' in 1970, (just missing out, but included here as it was the closest series in the 1960's) and I'm sure science fiction was alive and well in Europe in one form or another (I'm guessing here, but what classics am I missing?)If England had Gerry Anderson, (he also had other sci-fi related shows including `Captain Scarlet' a cult classic, to name just one more) America had Irwin Allen, the king of American science fiction television series, he didn't have one but four to his credit-and imagination to boot. `Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea' 1964-1968, `Lost in Space' 1965-1968, Time Tunnel 1966-67 and `Land of the Giants' 1968-1970.If Irwin had produced a show, say-entitled `The Land of the Giant Killer Plants', he would have pulled it off, that was the kind of man he was; what today's science fiction on television lacks, Irwin had and produced and proved it in the 1960's. As mentioned, all the shows are cult classics achieving cult stasis, I consider `Time Tunnel' the weakest of the four possibly classified as semi-cult, the idea was great but due to budget the show did not fulfil its potential.The Land of the Giants.Set in the then-future year of 1983, Land of the Giants was an hour-long American science fiction television program lasting two seasons beginning on September 22, 1968 and ending on March 22, 1970. The series tells the tale of the crew and passengers of a sub-orbital passenger spaceship called the Spindrift. In the pilot episode, the Spindrift is en route from Los Angeles to London via the ultra-fast route of a parabolic trajectory. Just beyond Earth's boundary with space, the Spindrift encounters a strange space storm, (a giant cosmic spaceball) and is transported to a mysterious planet inhabited by humanoid giants.Created and produced by Irwin Allen, the show was aired on ABC and released by 20th Century Fox Television. The series was filmed entirely in colour and ran for 51 episodes. The budget for the show per episode was $250,000 and it showed, the series was thus well produced and all the episodes including the characters was well represented-no stuffing around here, as the actors and the actresses took their jobs/roles seriously, (conflicts between Steve and Mark is just one example) thus the show was very credible, and enjoyable to watch.The `Little People':Gary Conway as Captain Steve BurtonDon Marshall as Dan EricksonDon Matheson as Mark WilsonKurt Kasznar as Alexander FitzhughStefan Arngrim as Barry LockridgeDeanna Lund as Valerie ScottHeather Young as Betty HamiltonWhen I was a wee young lad in the early 70's I use to watch the show when it was on, and I guess you can say I had my first of two TV crush's, one on Heather Young who played Betty, I thought she was real pretty, sadly watching the series again her character was the least used, concentrating on instead the other actress Deana Lund; and the other with Marta Kristen who played Judy in Lost in Space, I thought she was a real spunk.For the `Giants':Kevin Hagen as Inspector Kobick (having a recurring role)I have to confess that I really liked Kevin Hagan's performance as Inspector Kobick as the `Little People's' Nemesis, he did a great job, and was a credit to the show.Episodes to Note:The most interesting episode: Wild Journey - This episode should have been the last televised episode instead of `Graveyard of Fools', as it would have created a time-loop for the series (With the DVD you can view `Wild Journey' last anyway). It just goes to show that Steve and Dan actually had no control or is that control, over their fate that made them crash-land in the land of the giants in the first place.The most unusual episode: Nightmare - This episode has a surreal touch to it, I just find it fascinating to watch, it's so out of place with the rest of the series, that's why I think it's so remarkably different.The most boring episode: Our Man O'Reilly - This episode in my mind just wasn't going anywhere, there really wasn't any story in it-just a waste, I couldn't wait for it to finish.The most stupid episode: A Small War - A boy and his toys against the little people-how dull is that, just another wasted episode.Some episodes that I like: The Crash (both the `aired' and `unaired' versions), The Unsuspected, The Clones, A Place Called Earth, Land of the Lost, The Secret City of Limbo; plus all the episodes with Inspector Kobick.DVD Limited Edition.Okay, what are the goodies in store for you, if you get this edition?First of all, the series of DVD's is presented to you in a wooden cage replica, with a rope handle and with the lid/opening having actual wire mesh with a paper-colour relief of the cast behind it as the `Little People', real cool!Secondly when you open the lid-what's inside? You get the complete 51 episodes, 2-season series; this also includes an extra unaired episode of the pilot, `The Crash'. This is another version of the aired pilot, with different scenes not in the aired pilot, different music and one or two different camera angles on some scenes that are in the aired pilot. (Actually I like the unaired pilot better than the aired one-but that's just me I guess), that's 52 episodes! Not only that, but also have interviews of the actors/actresses as well.And what makes this edition special is some extra stuff which is well worth the money.1] Spindrift Key-Ring Chain.2] Four Picture Postcards.3] Spindrift Crew Patch (the ones that Steve, Dan and Betty wear on their uniforms).4] Cast Interview Booklet.5] A `Gold Key' miniature replica comic book of `Land of the Giants'.This limited edition is worth getting if you are a collector and/or a sci-fi buff; in all honesty I have never seen DVD editions presented like this, a lot of thought obviously went into this, to present this series to the public-well done 20th Century Fox.I am very happy with my copy of Land of the Giants to add to my collection. It would be good if 20th Century Fox did something special for the other Irwin Allen stuff. Here are my suggestions, naturally the DVD's would be inside these models, and thus these models would have to be big enough to encase them. (But it's just an idea, could be too expensive to produce though-just a dream)Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.A model of the Seaview with the first and second seasons, a model of the Driving Bell with the third season, and a model of the Flying Sub with the fourth season DVD's.Lost in Space.A model of the Jupiter 2 with the first season, a model of the Pod with the second season, and a model of the Robot with the third season DVD's.Time Tunnel.A model of an Hourglass with the first season DVD's.My advice is, get this limited edition of Land of the Giants before you can't or you'll be sorry, don't worry or go for other editions on the cheap, if you're going to spend the money then this edition is a must-go the extra dollar, you'll be happy in the long run.And you never know that wooden box could come in handy if you spot some little people in your garden-you know what I mean.Special thanks to Wikipedia for additional information to complete this review.",5,"One small step for IRWIN,

McMullen ""kinghazzah""","[12, 14]","I LOVE THIS SERIES but then again, I already OWN just about all the other Irwin Allen DVD sets in full (and I've just about gotten my Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea set now complete).  As many have said, yes the nostalgia element for those of us in the 40 something range who remember this as a first run series will probably love to have this item.  Sure it's a bit campy but ALL Irwin Allen is campy, that's why many of us love them.  I actually have only viewed the first side of the first DVD in the set (and I must admit I had to jump to the unaired pilot, which I actually liked hearing the Lost in Space music, even though I really do love Johnny Williams as he was known back then music) this one seems to be of excellent quality.Now on to the packaging -- in a word STINKS!!!The added extras, well I could probably live without the patch, the keychain, the postcards and the comic book NICE TO HAVE but not necessary, maybe it did help to sell to some people but I purchased the set only to have the DVD's.  The worst thing, however, about the packaging has again been said by others.  When the DVD's get shipped, they don't stay in the DVD jewel cases and this can cause damage to the discs even though the wooden box is still SHRINK WRAP SEALED!!!  I believe there should be better quality controls at the FACTORY before shipping the product out.  The Amazon Marketplace Vendor who shipped me this item was MOST careful to include LOT'S of bubblewrap and peanuts in the packing so that wasn't where the fault lies.  The DVD jewel cases aren't made very well and they allow the discs to come loose during shipment NOT necessarily from your vendor.  Since they are still shrinkwrapped, how's the vendor going to know if there is a problem or not?I also have a beef with a company who charges this much and then skimps on materials, especially using double sided DVD's instead of the industry standard single sided ones.  THIS PART IS RIDICULOUS!!!!  In the early days of DVD production when costs were relatively high, it was understandable WHY this was done.  Now with the advent of home DVR's where making DVD's from broadcast TV or your own home movies has become relatively commonplace (and by its very nature affordable) paying this much for a double sided edition of ANYTHING is price gouging!!!!!OK I've had my say, all in all I do like the series, I just wish that more care would be taken when going into production.

1068569,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000P5FH2Q,"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man""","[57, 63]","The year was 1968 and producer Irwin Allen had already taken TV viewers on a ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" gotten them ""Lost in Space,"" and thrown them through ""The Time Tunnel.""  He decided that it was time now to go a journey to a ""Land of the Giants.""Fans and critics alike feel that Allen was influenced by the respective films ""Dr. Cyclops"" (1940) and ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1957) and that is a fair assessment.  The show deals with the crew and passengers of a suborbital flight in the year 1983 that is somehow transported to a realm where they are ""six inch oddities"" in a land of gargantuan proportions.  The setting allowed the creative staff to place the seven principal cast members in all sorts of situations/dangers, making for possibly Allen's most visually striking and ""serious"" endeavor.  Though geared toward a young audience, the show occasionally showcased more adult themes than either of the producer's other three television efforts.  Such change may have been the result of the influence of NBC's ""Star Trek"" which was in the last season of its three-year run when ""Land of the Giants"" debuted.It also appears that some aspects of the show were more innovative than it was then perceived.  One is in the casting.  Don Marshall, who played co-pilot ""Dan Erickson,"" was one of the few black Americans on network television with a pivotal role.  The character was sometimes allowed to be the decision maker and shared close quarters with white female co-stars Deanna Lund (""Valerie"") and Heather Young (""Betty""), something that was revolutionary in the late sixties-early seventies.  Allen may not have considered that in his hiring of Marshall but it does elevate the actor to ""trailblazer status.""Also, Young's real-life pregnancy was obvious in the second season, leading to speculation that her character and one of the male characters may have been doing more than just ""struggling to survive.""  She was conveniently filmed standing behind other characters or with some prop hiding her ""development"" or she was conveniently absent from the story line altogether.The ""little people,"" as they were referred to by the inhabitants of this unusual realm, encountered friendly giants, sadistic giants, life-threatening balloon rides, hallucination-inducing mushrooms, mad scientists, diamond/jewelry thieves, as well as the usual assortment of ""silver-suited"" aliens common to Allen productions.  The land in which the Earthlings found themselves was a police state, of sorts, and they found themselves relentlessly pursued by Inspector Kobick, well played by Kevin Hagen, a frequent performer in Allen productions.Not only did the seven principals have to make their situation believable, they had to endure the physical challenge of running, climbing, and handling giant props and impressive set designs...and did the creative staff give them a lot with which to work.  Some oversized objects included hydrants, cameras, a dog's leash, a menacing mop, test tubes, a hungry chicken, drains, a horse's rein, anything that the storyline imagined.It is obvious that each of them, including the fifty-something Kurt Kaszner (""Commander Fitzhugh""), was in pretty good shape.The show's production values included inspired casting in most episodes.  There were actors that were in Allen's ""repertory company"" and they could be seen in all of the producer's series.  These included John Carradine, Lee Meriwether, John Crawford, Warren Stevens, Nehemiah Persoff, Malachi Throne, Michael Ansara, Paul Fix, Jonathan Harris, and the producer's future wife Sheila Matthews. In addition to those familiar faces, Oscar winners Broderick Crawford and Jack Albertson appear in one installment, respectively.Boxers-turned-occasional actors Sugar Ray Robinson and Jerry Quarry find themselves featured as giants on the show, too.Also, years before they hit it big in their signature roles, ""Land of the Giants"" showcased the efforts of future stars Susan Howard (""Dallas""), Vic Tayback (""Alice""), and Sam Elliott (""Lifeguard,"" ""The Hulk,"" and the upcoming ""The Golden Compass"").Even a certain Oscar-winning director by the name of Ron Howard pops up as a ""special guest star"" in one episode!The nine-disc (four two-sided and a single) showcases the fifty-one installments with much better sound and picture than their original airings, a plus for an almost forty-year-old show.  On the ninth disc are found insightful reflections from stars Gary Conway (""Steve""), Don Matheson (""Mark""), Lund, Marshall, and Stefan Arngrim (""Barry"").The Gold Key comic is a great addition, especially for those of us fortunate to have read one during its publication.Besides the nifty carrying case, a true bonus is the addition of the UNAIRED original pilot, minus John William's outstanding score.  Though the pilot featured the composer's music written for ""Lost in Space,"" the revamped pilot, ""The Crash,"" takes on a much more exciting dynamic with the music that he composed for the actual premiere episode.Though it may not go down as one of the great shows of all time, ""Land of the Giants"" is still a remarkable bit of television production and this GIGANTIC compilation set does it justice.",4,A show this BIG deserves the full treatment!,1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,5199,"['year', 'was', '1968', 'producer', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'had', 'already', 'taken', 'TV', 'viewers', 'Voyage',

They look horrible. Be warned.Also be informed that now the set has been issued in the UK and amazon carries it. It is much cheaper and it is recorded on 14 discs, double-layered, so it means single-sided.Your decision. I am not asking Amazon for a replacement, because I would have to pay custom taxes again given the high set price.On the other hand, the show looks pristine and complete.

As an adult the show is hardly as exciting but still it provides some campy entertainment. The quality of the video seems to be pretty high. The show though is rather dumb. The passengers of the Spindrift encounter someone every week in the middle of some forest. Still the group is never to far to venture into some urban setting.Anyway, the packaging is BAD. I say this because the plastic cases are not able to secure the double sided discs from being damaged. The cases are separated by a wooden slat. There is no pressure on the plastic cases and so the discs fall off of the retainer rings. The first thing I did was to put each disc in a paper sleeve to protect each one from damage. Through two discs thus far all of the shows play just fine. One piece of wood that holds the screen in the front of the package is coming loose. I need to tack a brad into the frame to hold that piece of wood together. All in all I think the CONCEPT of the PACKAGE was quite GOOD.

I started only because I wanted to see the first episode, since I missed that one when the show was briefly syndicated back in the mid-seventies.  I'm continuing because, to my surprise, the show is quite good.  Unlike Lost In Space, LOTG quickly establishes the personalities of the characters.  As the series progresses, the characters show at least a bit of depth and complexity.  Fitzhugh is craven and self-centered, but he is, at times, altruistic and faithful to his companions.  Betty is a nurturing peacekeeper (good in a stewardess), but she is quite ready and able to kick the crap out of a punk captor when necessary.  There is a strong component of volatile character interaction that was dreadfully weak and altogether too predictable in other Irwin Allen shows.  In fact, I think that the acting and writing in LOTG can better be compared to the disaster films that Allen did so successfully in the mid-seventies.  While I'd not classify this show as a classic (heck, for me, all Irwin Allen sci-fi/fantasy shows amount to guilty pleasures), I do think that it was surprisingly well done and is on a level footing with most of VTTBOTS.

In the science fiction genre, it ranks with Star Trek, The Time Tunnel, and The Invaders, as one of my favorites from the 1960's.  Science fantasy master Irwin's Allen's creation had a terrific cast, good stories, and very believable cutting edge special effects.  Being a fan of the crew of the Spindrift, the main reason that this classic show is not in my collection is because the price is too high, and I refuse to support releases that gouge loyal fans.Initially, Get Smart (138 episodes on 25 single sided discs), and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (105 episodes on 41 single sided discs), were exclusively being sold by Time Life, for $199.95 and 249.95 respectively.  When these sets were first released to the general public, they were often available on sale at Amazon as Deals of the Day, at great savings.  The Get Smart set currently sells for $86.99 and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. set is currently $139.90.  Like The Land of the Giants, both Get Smart, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E., had special packaging and extensive extras.Unlike the series sited above, which have dropped in price at least 40%, the price for the Land of the Giants has remained high since its initial release.  For $187.49 you are getting 51 episodes, on nine double sided discs.  That's right, that big huge box, contains just nine disks!  Compare that to the 41 disks in the less expensive U.N.C.L.E. set.  Just as a rough comparison, at current regular prices, an episode of Land of the Giants costs about $3.68, versus $1.33 for an episode of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.  While the price has come down slightly, the Land of the Giants set was grossly overpriced from the start, and double sided discs just do not belong in a premium quality release.Land of the Giants, was a fun series.  Kurt Kazsnar was fabulous, and Gary Conway and Don Marshall made a great team.  I would greatly enjoy seeing the program again, but unfortunately it probably  won't happen, unless the price comes way down, or I can get the set used for much.  Instead of buying The Land of the Giants, for the same money, I can get a big stack of DVD's of other television shows.",2,seems like it is time for a price break . . .,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,2345,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', '60', 'television', 'would', 'love', 'add', 'Land', 'Giants', 'collection', 'saw', 'kid', 'original', 'run', 'was', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'compelling', 'show', 'never', 'forgot', 'science', 'fiction', 'genre', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Time', 'Tunnel', 'Invaders', 'one', 'favorites', '1960', 'Science', 'fantasy', 'master', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'creation', 'had', 'terrific', 'cast', 'good', 'stories', 'very', 'believable', 'cutting', 'edge', 'special', 'effects', 'Being', 'fan', 'crew', 'Spindrift', 'main', 'reason', 'classic', 'show', 'not', 'collection', 'price', 'too', 'high', 'refuse', 'support', 'releases', 'gouge', 'loyal', 'fans.Initially', 'Get', 'Smart', '138', 'episodes', '25', 'single', 'sided', 'discs', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E', '105', 'episodes', '41', 'single', 'sided', 'discs', 'were', 'exclusively', 'being', 'sold', 'Time', 'Life', '199.95', '249.95', 'respectively', 'When', 'sets', 'were', 'first', 'released', 'general', 'public', 'were', 'often', 'available', 'sale', 'Amazon', 'Deals', 'Day', 'great', 'savings', 'Get', 'Smart', 'set', 'currently', '86.99', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'set', 'currently', '139.90', 'Land', 'Giants', 'Get', 'Smart', 'Man', 'From', 'U.N.C.L.E.', 'had', 'special', 'packaging', 'extensive', 'series', 'sited', 'have', 'dropped', 'price', 'least', '40', '%', 'price', 'Land', 'Giants', 'remained', 'high', 'initial', 'release', '187.49', 'are', 'getting', '51', 'episodes', 'nine', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'right', 'big', 'huge', 'box', 'just', 'nine', 'disks', 'Compare', '41', 'disks', 'less', 'expensive', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'set', 'Just', 'rough', 'comparison', 'current', 'regular', 'prices', 'episode', 'Land', 'Giants', 'costs', '3.68', 'versus', '1.33', 'episode', 'Man', 'U.N.C.L.E', 'price', 'come', 'down', 'slightly', 'Land', 'Giants', 'set', 'was', 'grossly', 'overpriced', 'start', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'belong', 'premium', 'quality', 'release.Land', 'Giants', 'was', 'fun', 'series', 'Kurt', 'Kazsnar', 'was', 'fabulous', 'Gary', 'Conway', 'Don', 'Marshall', 'made', 'great', 'team', 'would', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'program', 'again', 'unfortunately', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'price', 'way', 'down', 'can', 'get', 'set', 'used', 'much', 'Instead', 'buying', 'Land', 'Giants', 'same', 'money', 'can', 'get', 'big', 'stack', 'DVD', 'other', 'television', 'shows']",Land of the Giants: The Full Series

I'm a fan but I won't pay full price for this set so I got in on the half price sale.  You can also find it cheaper on other sites like Ebay.  It's hard to believe they kept the show on for two seasons while shows today hardly last one.  The show still holds up well with great sets and camera work.  This isn't a numbered set so I don't know how limited it is.  Just think for about 30 bucks more you can get the ten season set of Stargate SG-1.  A nice set but do some research before you buy.,5,Must buy for Fans,1189468800,"09 11, 2007",2007,641,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'then', 'must', 'own', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'then', 'better', 'rent', 'first', 'chuck', 'cash', ""'m"", 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'set', 'so', 'got', 'half', 'price', 'sale', 'can', 'also', 'find', 'cheaper', 'other', 'sites', 'Ebay', 'hard', 'believe', 'kept', 'show', 'two', 'seasons', 'shows', 'today', 'hardly', 'last', 'one', 'show', 'still', 'up', 'well', 'great', 'sets', 'camera', 'work', ""n't"", 'numbered', 'set', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'limited', 'Just', 'think', 'about', '30', 'bucks', 'more', 'can', 'get', 'ten', 'season', 'set', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'A', 'nice', 'set', 'do', 'research', 'buy']",Land of the Giants: The Full Series
