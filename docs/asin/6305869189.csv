This was something I just had to have, my mom said get good grades and I'll get for you, and I did, and she was so proud we came on Amazon and preordered it straight away.  I don't frequent this release as much as I previously did, of course, concert DVDs lose their value quite quickly.  I do fondly remember it alot and come back to it and watch it front to back of course.  Great performance, great artist, and don't forget a rather long and interesting interview.
