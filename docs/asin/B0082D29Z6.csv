Because it knows it's a movie. Unlike other Naruto films (Including Road to Ninja), This film doesn't try to force some message from the show down your throat. NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG!!! I don't mind that in the other films (Except Lost Tower, that movie sucks). But Blood Prison is just a side story of fun, mystery, and action. It has a cool mystery/conspiracy that forces Naruto into a very bad situation. But it never contradicts what was put out in the original series or even the other movies. And the message it sent about Forgiveness and Moving forward after making mistakes was very well written and executed. Plus, from the fan perspective, it had everything we wanted. Cool action showcasing all the characters and SAGE MODE!!!To sum up, Blood Prison has all the good things from Naruto and the other movies. It has the awesome concepts of the series. It has all the characters fighting like the Will of Fire. And it has the Message we can all stand behind from Road to Ninja. And, as a side note, THE ANIMATION WAS GODLY!!! It's a fun watch even if you aren't a fan of the series. Highly recommend to everyone. I hope this helps your decision.",5,The Best Naruto movie.

1544760,A18GP7JOZT0842,B0082D29Z6,JimD,"[2, 4]","I was hesitant to buy this movie, since it is not a dubbed version.  The story description, and my love of the series provided enough friction where I decided that I did not want to wait it out.  I can't be happier with my decision.  I won't go into any detail on the story or plot, other than Naruto is one of the best written animes, with excellent character development and well thought continuity.  If you want to know about the plot, read the Amazon synopsis.I want to inform that the video quality is quite good, and if you use an upscaling DVD player - looks really good on screen.  While I only have a pedestrian understanding of Japanese, playing the audio with the subtitles HELPS the immersion process.  The voice actors do an excellent job conveying the urgency of the situation.  Unlike their English Dub counterparts -who try to emulate the spoken Japanese inflection the Japanese dialogue gives the proper weight and balance.  English Dubs always sounds like they're screaming at each other-which just isn't the case.  I have become accustomed to this screeching on many of the animes over the years.If you're considering buying this, but hesitant concerned about the VIDEO quality - it is first rate.  If you're concerned about not understanding the dialogue - the subtitles work.  I was also concerned that with subtitles, I would 'miss&#34; the action because I was reading the dialouge, and there is some of that..but the movie is worth a second look - so problem solved.",5,Excellent,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,1490,"['was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'movie', 'not', 'dubbed', 'version', 'story', 'description', 'love', 'series', 'provided', 'enough', 'friction', 'where', 'decided', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'wait', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'decision', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'story', 'plot', 'other', 'Naruto', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'animes', 'excellent', 'character', 'development', 'well', 'thought', 'continuity', 'want', 'know', 'plot', 'read', 'Amazon', 'synopsis.I', 'want', 'inform', 'video', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'use', 'upscaling', 'DVD', 'player', 'really', 'good', 'screen', 'only', 'have', 'pedestrian', 'understanding', 'Japanese', 'playing', 'audio', 'subtitles', 'HELPS', 'immersion', 'process', 'voice', 'actors', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'urgency', 'situation', 'English', 'Dub', 'counterparts', '-who', 'try', 'emulate', 'spoken', 'Japanese', 'inflection', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'proper', 'weight', 'balance', 'English', 'Dubs', 'always', ""'re"", 'screaming', 'other-which', 'just', ""n't"", 'case', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'screeching', 'many', 'animes', 'years.If', ""'re"", 'considering', 'buying', 'hesitant', 'concerned', 'VIDEO', 'quality', 'first', 'rate', ""'re"", 'concerned', 'not', 'understanding', 'dialogue', 'subtitles', 'work', 'was', 'also', 'concerned', 'subtitles', 'would', ""'miss"", '34', 'action', 'was', 'reading', 'dialouge', 'that..but', 'movie', 'second', 'look', 'so', 'problem', 'solved']",N/A
