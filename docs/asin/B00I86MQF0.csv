When TGG Direct licensed this series, there were episodes that had home video clearance issues such as music rights, etc. that prevent us from releasing the complete series.  It is not in the authority of TGG Direct to authorize clearance nor are we provided the exact legal issue that is prohibiting the release of these excluded episodes.
