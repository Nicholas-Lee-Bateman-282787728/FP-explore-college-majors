But it was already in my cue, and had already shipped, and I have a hard time saying no to most movies, So I popped this puppy in. Though not great by any means, it was considerably better than Escape 2000.Here's the scoop. The world is breaking down. Economic ruin is everywhere. Punk thugs are taking over the streets and towing companies fight over the rights to tow freshly crashed vehicles. Our hero borrows his brother's car to take his gal to a drive in movie. While they're there the cops steal two of his wheels. He now finds he can't leave and this place actually turns out to be a kind of concentration camp where the inmates spend their days primping, getting high and watching earlier Brian Trenchard Smith movies.This is more than a bit strange. It seems to deal with much of what must have been happening in Australia at the time. Part deals with the car culture and it's subsequent body count. Then there are the disenfranchised youth. All the inmates in this camp are punked out with spiked Mohawks, way over the top make-up and clothes. Then they bring in the fear of foreigners aspect. As Asians are trucked into the camp the inmates shout ""No Asians."" Funny they would feel the need to be politically correct while shouting at those they both fear and loathe. There is also a conspiracy side to this. The theatre owner tracks all inmates on a computer and the officials bring in drugs, a' la the CIA, to keep everybody happy and in line.This is certainly directed much better than 'Escape 2000' but it still has some major screw-ups. At the climax, our hero does something so unbelievably stupid it boggles the mind. The movie is spotted with some very dumb stuff. Plus, I'm not certain what Smith was getting at. If this is a government project then why are these young people content to while away their days with nothing to do and no desire to escape. Who is it Smith is pointing a finger at? The production design is also better than 'Escape 2000.' The sets and props look more real. Overall this was a much better outing and it clocks in at under ninety minutes so one's patience isn't put to the test.This probably amounts to more of an historical curiosity than anything else. If you need to fill in some gaps in your film history then have at it. If not, you're not hurting yourself by letting this slip by.",3,Better Than I Expected,1301616000,"04 1, 2011",2011,2450,"['Having', 'just', 'viewed', 'Brian', 'Trenchard', 'Smith', 'Godawful', ""'Escape"", '2000', 'thought', 'was', 'horrible', 'outing', 'was', 'already', 'cue', 'had', 'already', 'shipped', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'saying', 'most', 'movies', 'popped', 'puppy', 'not', 'great', 'means', 'was', 'considerably', 'better', 'Escape', '2000.Here', 'scoop', 'world', 'breaking', 'down', 'Economic', 'ruin', 'everywhere', 'Punk', 'thugs', 'are', 'taking', 'streets', 'towing', 'companies', 'fight', 'rights', 'tow', 'freshly', 'crashed', 'vehicles', 'hero', 'brother', 'car', 'take', 'gal', 'drive', 'movie', ""'re"", 'cops', 'steal', 'two', 'wheels', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'place', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'kind', 'concentration', 'camp', 'where', 'inmates', 'spend', 'days', 'primping', 'getting', 'high', 'watching', 'earlier', 'Brian', 'Trenchard', 'Smith', 'movies.This', 'more', 'bit', 'strange', 'deal', 'much', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'happening', 'Australia', 'time', 'Part', 'deals', 'car', 'culture', 'subsequent', 'body', 'count', 'Then', 'are', 'disenfranchised', 'youth', 'inmates', 'camp', 'are', 'punked', 'out', 'spiked', 'Mohawks', 'way', 'top', 'make-up', 'clothes', 'Then', 'bring', 'fear', 'foreigners', 'aspect', 'Asians', 'are', 'trucked', 'camp', 'inmates', 'Asians', 'would', 'feel', 'need', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'shouting', 'fear', 'loathe', 'also', 'conspiracy', 'side', 'theatre', 'owner', 'tracks', 'inmates', 'computer', 'officials', 'bring', 'drugs', 'la', 'CIA', 'keep', 'everybody', 'happy', 'line.This', 'certainly', 'directed', 'much', 'better', ""'Escape"", '2000', 'still', 'major', 'screw-ups', 'climax', 'hero', 'something', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'mind', 'movie', 'spotted', 'very', 'dumb', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'Smith', 'was', 'getting', 'government', 'project', 'then', 'why', 'are', 'young', 'people', 'content', 'while', 'away', 'days', 'nothing', 'do', 'desire', 'escape', 'Who', 'Smith', 'pointing', 'finger', 'production', 'design', 'also', 'better', ""'Escape"", '2000', 'sets', 'props', 'look', 'more', 'real', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'outing', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'one', 'patience', ""n't"", 'put', 'test.This', 'probably', 'more', 'historical', 'curiosity', 'anything', 'else', 'need', 'fill', 'gaps', 'film', 'history', 'then', 'have', 'not', ""'re"", 'not', 'hurting', 'letting', 'slip']",N/A

Elephantine. Point is, part of what we love doing most every October, is watching a lot of 80s horror. We made a list of our favorites when we were kids, and came looking to purchase them. 80s horror feels nothing like today's horror, so to like this movie, you have to be into this sort of thing. It's filmed differently, paced differently. The whole vibe is different. Dead End Drive-In is a great example of what we love about this stuff. I don't describe the plots of movies.
