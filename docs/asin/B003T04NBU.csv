1361737,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B003T04NBU,Anthony Pittore,"[10, 11]","Fourteen years ago (even though some of the cars were from the mid-2000s), Claire (Meghan Ory) was horrifically traumatized in the ""Darrode House,"" the site of a brutal massacre that left seven children dead by the hand of their evil foster mother Miss Darrode. In present day, Claire is plagued with night terrors, panic attacks, and other psychological ailments rooted deep in her suppressed memories of that terrible day. To fight these fears, her psychiatrist tells her that she must return to the scene of the event and face what happened there so many years ago. She gets her chance when her acting troupe, which is composed of a jock, a black guy, a goth, a slutty blonde, etc. (seriously), decides to join a high-tech haunted house for Halloween. But, uh oh! The creator of the haunted house, entrepreneur Walston (played by horror icon Jeffrey Combs), has chosen none other than the Darrode House itself in which to stage the house of terrors! As expected, Miss Darrode and her house are not happy with their unwelcome visitors. . .As many horror fans will tell, it is very difficult to make a great ""haunted house"" movie. Even those who believe in the paranormal often do not fall for many of the tricks & scares that are frequent in ghost-themed horror films. Other than `Paranormal Activity,' it has been several years since the U.S. has had an overly successful (critically and/or financially) haunted house film, instead having mediocre pictures like `An American Haunting' or `The Haunting in Connecticut.' One of the major failures of the subgenre comes from the lack of subtlety that ends up ruining any chance at real terror. That being said, it seems that `Dark House' was never made to be `the next great haunted house film.' It was aware of its limitations and, instead of true fear, it went for the next best things in horror: fun & blood. And, while a darker `Dark House' may have been a welcome idea, this way worked well enough for a fun evening.On the technical side of the film, there isn't a lot to complain about. Unfortunately, there isn't too much to be praised either. The cast had its flaws, especially when they took their roles as the haunted house characters. Making this worse was the ridiculous dialogue written for them, turning what would just be laughable stereotypes into something much, much more annoying and frustrating. Luckily, Jeffrey Combs, as he so often does in films like this, acts as saviour. It would be difficult to write a character for Combs that would be anything close to annoying, and that's why viewers will be grateful to have this slightly creepy, often funny madman in the film. Looking past the dialogue, the writing isn't too awful. The story progression and overall plot was fairly trite, but it was delivered in such a way that made it entertaining enough to look past its general lack of originality. As for the element of this film that seemed to matter most, the special effects were quite wavering in their quality. The ""hologram"" effects & transitions were actually done fairly well, but the quality quickly degraded anytime the holograms interacted/attacked the humans. Given the budget, however, the FX weren't really a disappointment.Overall, this is not going to be a film that will go down in the annals of horror history as great or memorable cinema. However, viewers looking for an entertaining evening with a few jump scares and some gore will find enjoyment in `Dark House.'Final Verdict: 6/10.-AP3-",3,Fun & bloody little haunted house horror,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,3482,"['Fourteen', 'years', 'ago', 'even', 'cars', 'were', 'mid-2000s', 'Claire', 'Meghan', 'Ory', 'was', 'horrifically', 'traumatized', 'Darrode', 'House', 'site', 'brutal', 'massacre', 'left', 'seven', 'children', 'dead', 'hand', 'evil', 'foster', 'mother', 'Miss', 'Darrode', 'present', 'day', 'Claire', 'plagued', 'night', 'terrors', 'panic', 'attacks', 'other', 'psychological', 'ailments', 'rooted', 'deep', 'suppressed', 'memories', 'terrible', 'day', 'fight', 'fears', 'psychiatrist', 'must', 'return', 'scene', 'event', 'face', 'what', 'happened', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'chance', 'when', 'acting', 'troupe', 'composed', 'jock', 'black', 'guy', 'goth', 'slutty', 'blonde', 'etc', 'seriously', 'join', 'high-tech', 'haunted', 'house', 'Halloween', 'uh', 'oh', 'creator', 'haunted', 'house', 'entrepreneur', 'Walston', 'played', 'horror', 'icon', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'chosen', 'none', 'other', 'Darrode', 'House', 'stage', 'house', 'terrors', 'expected', 'Miss', 'Darrode', 'house', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'unwelcome', 'visitors', '.As', 'many', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'tell', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'great', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'Even', 'who', 'believe', 'paranormal', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'fall', 'many', 'tricks', 'scares', 'are', 'frequent', 'ghost-themed', 'horror', 'films', 'Other', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'been', 'several', 'years', 'U.S.', 'had', 'overly', 'successful', 'critically', 'and/or', 'financially', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'instead', 'having', 'mediocre', 'pictures', 'American', 'Haunting', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'One', 'major', 'failures', 'subgenre', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'up', 'ruining', 'chance', 'real', 'terror', 'being', 'said', 'Dark', 'House', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'be', 'next', 'great', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'was', 'aware', 'limitations', 'instead', 'true', 'fear', 'went', 'next', 'best', 'things', 'horror', 'fun', 'blood', 'darker', 'Dark', 'House', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'idea', 'way', 'worked', 'well', 'enough', 'fun', 'technical', 'side', 'film', ""n't"", 'lot', 'complain', 'about', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'be', 'praised', 'cast', 'had', 'flaws', 'especially', 'when', 'took', 'roles', 'haunted', 'house', 'characters', 'Making', 'worse', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'dialogue', 'written', 'turning', 'what', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'laughable', 'stereotypes', 'something', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'annoying', 'frustrating', 'Luckily', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'so', 'often', 'films', 'saviour', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'write', 'character', 'Combs', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'close', 'annoying', 'why', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'grateful', 'have', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'often', 'funny', 'madman', 'film', 'Looking', 'dialogue', 'writing', ""n't"", 'too', 'awful', 'story', 'progression', 'overall', 'plot', 'was', 'fairly', 'trite', 'was', 'delivered', 'such', 'way', 'made', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'look', 'general', 'lack', 'originality', 'element', 'film', 'seemed', 'matter', 'most', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'quite', 'wavering', 'quality', 'hologram', 'effects', 'transitions', 'were', 'actually', 'done', 'fairly', 'well', 'quality', 'quickly', 'degraded', 'anytime', 'holograms', 'interacted/attacked', 'humans', 'Given', 'budget', 'however', 'FX', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'disappointment.Overall', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'annals', 'horror', 'history', 'great', 'memorable', 'cinema', 'However', 'viewers', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'evening', 'few', 'jump', 'scares', 'gore', 'will', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'Dark', 'House', ""'Final"", 'Verdict', '6/10.-AP3-']",N/A

Oh, it might have had potential, but that was lost because of so many inconsistencies in the script.  The film doesn't look cheap.  Colors are very vivid and overall the picture had a nice look to it.  However,...It began with three pre-teen girls arriving at the local ""haunted house.""  That's unbelievable part #1.  You see, MOST haunted houses are run-down, unkempt, and OLD.  This is one of the most gorgeous Victorian houses you'll ever see.  But I digress.  While standing outside the gate, they hear screams from the inside and one decides she'll go investigate.  That's unbelievable part 2.  When she opens the door, she sees the bodies of small children everywhere.  Does she leave?  Unbelievable part #3.  Oh no; that would make sense.  After seeing seven slaughtered little lambs, she comes upon the caregiver who must have decided she just couldn't get her hands clean enough, because she has buried them in the garbage disposal--while it's running.  Little girl dumb slips in a puddle of goo, whacks her head, and...it's 14 years later.  Little girl dumb has now become really-old-teenager-with-lots-of-problems.

I have to say that it was excellent to see Jeffrey Combs in this; I think he is what made it so fun. Of course the story behind this was made for such claims since it is about holograms that can actually kill. Those things put together mixed in with some cool kills make for a good little Fango flick.When Claire was a little girl she was placed in a foster in which she witnessed the slaughter of all the kids there. Since then she has had professional help and is trying to move on. In doing so she is taking an acting class, bad move on her part. A man comes in named Walston [Jeffery Combs] who is famous for his horror attractions. He is opening a new haunted house and is looking for some actors. The class agrees to do it but the new attraction is the house in which the massacre happened. Claire agrees to do it as well thinking it will help her move on. Once their Walston showcases his new and very realistic looking hologram spooks. All is well until the critics show up for a special performance, it seems the holograms are coming to life and someone or something is behind it.This film had an interesting storyline behind it, one that got my attention right away. The murdering of the kids by their caretaker reeled me in. Something about kids in horror movies has always creeped me out. Then of course all of the hologram ghouls and such just looked great. So all that was going for this film, plus Combs is excellent here like he always is. In fact all of the actors were really good in this but Diane Salinger was the show stealer here. At times she is scary and at others she is out there crazy. Still when she was on screen I was watching for sure.Don't get me wrong this is not the best movie of all time but like I have said many times before it was a fun flick. If you are a haunted house, monster, or horror fan I am sure you will enjoy this movie for what it is. The DVD has a commentary track on it and trailers for the other Fangoria Fright Fest flicks.

1361748,A3PZTH1DTX6O6B,B003T04NBU,"H. F. Gibbard ""History Buff""","[0, 0]","""Dark House"" has a high-concept premise that I believe could have succeeded if handled more deftly and perhaps with a bigger budget.  Mr. Walston, a morally-impaired impresario, has designed a haunted house attraction with state-of-the-art holographic illusions and effects.  The holograms are so real they are guaranteed to scare the living daylights out of anyone who takes the tour of his haunted mansion.  But with both bad taste and poor judgment he has placed his illusions inside a _real_ haunted house which is plagued by the spirit of Ms. Darrode, a religious fanatic who murdered seven children fourteen years earlier, then killed herself.  Walston hires an acting class to staff his haunted house, but Ms. Darrode is not happy about the intruders in her domain.  In particular, she resents one of the actors, a girl who escaped her malevolent powers when she massacred the other children.  Soon, the murders begin...This scenario had plenty of promise.  What's real?  What's illusion? Where does the true danger lie?  Unfortunately, this movie surrenders itself to cheesy special effects, terrible dialogue, and cardboard characters, to the point that it almost totally wastes its intriguing premise.  Sadly, there are references to much better films, most notably the Waxworks series.There is one reason to watch this film, however, and that is to see Diane Salinger's turn as the ghost of Ms. Darrode.  (In the version I watched, her performance begins at about the 1:06:00 point.)  Salinger, who played fun characters like ""Simone"" in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and the psychiatrist in ""Ghost World,"" is almost unrecognizable here in grotesque makeup and an outrageous fright wig.  Bless her, she delivers an over-the-top performance, chewing the scenery with terrifying intensity.  I can't remember a more outr&eacute; portrayal of sheer malevolent madness, made all the more poignant by the fact that the rest of the film is so incredibly mediocre.  I liked her before, but with this film Salinger has made a fan of me for life.",3,"mediocre, with one exception",1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,2041,"['Dark', 'House', 'high-concept', 'premise', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'succeeded', 'handled', 'more', 'deftly', 'perhaps', 'bigger', 'budget', 'Mr.', 'Walston', 'morally-impaired', 'impresario', 'designed', 'haunted', 'house', 'attraction', 'state-of-the-art', 'holographic', 'illusions', 'effects', 'holograms', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'scare', 'living', 'daylights', 'anyone', 'who', 'tour', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'bad', 'taste', 'poor', 'judgment', 'placed', 'illusions', '_real_', 'haunted', 'house', 'plagued', 'spirit', 'Ms.', 'Darrode', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'who', 'murdered', 'seven', 'children', 'fourteen', 'years', 'earlier', 'then', 'killed', 'Walston', 'acting', 'class', 'staff', 'haunted', 'house', 'Ms.', 'Darrode', 'not', 'happy', 'intruders', 'domain', 'particular', 'one', 'actors', 'girl', 'who', 'escaped', 'malevolent', 'powers', 'when', 'massacred', 'other', 'children', 'Soon', 'murders', 'begin', 'scenario', 'had', 'plenty', 'promise', 'What', 'real', 'What', 'illusion', 'Where', 'true', 'danger', 'lie', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'terrible', 'dialogue', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'point', 'almost', 'totally', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'Sadly', 'are', 'references', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'most', 'notably', 'Waxworks', 'one', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'however', 'see', 'Diane', 'Salinger', 'turn', 'ghost', 'Ms.', 'Darrode', 'version', 'watched', 'performance', '1:06:00', 'point', 'Salinger', 'who', 'played', 'fun', 'characters', 'Simone', 'Pee-Wee', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'psychiatrist', 'Ghost', 'World', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'here', 'grotesque', 'makeup', 'outrageous', 'fright', 'wig', 'Bless', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'terrifying', 'intensity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'more', 'outr', 'eacute', 'portrayal', 'sheer', 'malevolent', 'madness', 'made', 'more', 'poignant', 'fact', 'rest', 'film', 'so', 'incredibly', 'mediocre', 'liked', 'film', 'Salinger', 'made', 'fan', 'life']",N/A

A bombastic producer of haunted amusement attractions purchases an old victorian manor where a horrible mass murder of children occurred 14 years ago by a deranged foster mother ( Miss Darrode ) who stabbed the children she cared for to death before committing suicide, and he sets it up as a walk-through haunted house controlled by sophisticated computers that craft laser-generated ghosts , demons and demented killers to thrill and shock the guests. He then hires some local amateur actors to play roles as guides and characters in the house. One of the actors is a young woman, Claire,  who..., unknown to the new owner of the house or even her closest friends..., was the sole child survivor of that mass murder 14 years ago. There are some very brutal scenes in this movie and some dark comedy interspersed.  The one quandary is, how does an evil spirit ( Miss Darrode ) know how to operate a sophisticated cutting edge computer mainframe and make it produce solid creatures from a holographic laser system? And..., the blood is overdone, there are geysers of it everywhere in this film as people get sliced and diced..., to the point that it becomes an apathetic tool and no longer frightening. Still, it's fun for a cheap scare,  and if you don't take it too seriously then it's entertaining to watch. I recommend it.

Interestingly, all of them came out in 2009. There's Wojciech Smarzowki's Polish thriller, Will Koopman's Dutch stalker flick, and Darin Scott's American haunted-house story. I haven't seen the other two, so I'm not 100% certain about this, but I would still lay money on the proposition that Darin Scott's is the worst of the three.Plot: an attraction mogul, Walston (Re-Animator's Jeffrey Combs), buys a supposedly haunted house in generic suburban America and plans to turn it into a modern haunted house attraction. To that end, he rigs it up with all sorts of lovely computers in the basement and a bunch of revolutionary effects (big problem with the movie #1: &#8220;revolutionary effects&#8221; and &#8220;bad CGI&#8221; really, really do not mix) (oh, and big problem #2: why did all the ghosties not come out and attack all the workmen installing this stuff, who would have had to have been there for weeks, if not months?) and hires a team of young-and-beautifuls as tourguides, models, and folks to dress up. The usual haunted house shtick. Except, of course, the house is really haunted, and one of said young-and-beautifuls, Claire (Once Upon a Time's Meghan Ory), has a connection to the house, and the events therein, that she did not disclose...which makes her a conduit for the nasty goings-on. Or something.It's actually not a bad little idea, if not one that's anything new. But Scott, better known as a producer (on much better films, e.g. Menace II Society), wrote such a ham-handed script, and then cast actors with so much more of an eye towards budget than ability, that even the best idea would have gone horribly wrong. I'm not going to say it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It wasn't even the worst movie I watched that week (my spreadsheet informs me I had been traumatized by Parasitic just three days before). The young and beautifuls are, in fact, young and beautiful, even if most of them couldn't act their collective way out of a paper bag, and when Scott abandons the amateurish CGI and goes for the good old-fashioned gore effects, with rubber prosthetics and squibs, you can convince yourself, for a few minutes at least, that there's a good time to be had here.

The acclaimed horror festival has been a complete bust up until it's fourth film, Dark House. This is a highly imaginative film, with one hell of a twist in the end, and as all of my regular readers know, I love a good twist at the end! Dark House is Walston's newest haunted attraction, featuring state of the art technology, that promises to rattle even the most fearless of people. Aside from the new technology, the big draw for Dark House is that it is the actual house where a ghastly mass murder took place years earlier. Besides it's cool effects, what I really liked about this film was the strong background story that goes along with it. Yes, it does eventually become a gorefest, but it comes after you've been watching a really interesting story for quite some time. As for the gore, it's not what you usually see either, as it's done in a b-movie style. This was really interesting to me, as the attraction features state of the art technology, but the actual murder scenes look like something out of a cheesy 70s film. The stars of the film are mostly newcomers, and as expect some were great, while others need more school, but it's a fairly large cast, so those actors who aren't very good, didn't have much screen time. Dark House will make you jump, make you laugh, and shock you with it's surprise ending. There's a simple plot, that's easy to follow, and an interesting back story for those of us who like to think a little bit.
