But in this case, I'm going to make an exception.I'm also no great lover of all of Steven Spielberg's films (although I do enjoy many of them), but Mr. Spielberg (director of the remake of this film, re-titled ""Always"", staring Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter, and John Goodman) seemed to have a better grasp of the relationship between Pete -- the main protagonist -- and Dorinda -- the main protagonist's love interest -- than did the director of ""A Guy Named Joe"", Victor Fleming.And let's face it, their relationship is what the story is all about. A cocky fly-boy who strives to maintain his independence but is deeply in love with another woman who also happens to love flying. Spencer Tracy plays Pete Sandidge, a gruff but extremely able pilot, fighting the good fight against the Germans during WW II. His only vice is his affection toward Dorinda Durston (Irene Dunne), a beautiful lady in the Womens Air Corp. But when Pete dies bombing a German carrier (which, by the way, is historically false since Germany never made one before the end of the war), Dorinda turns inward, choosing a life of loneliness and despair, until she meets Ted Randall (Van Johnson). Little does Dorinda and Ted, and Pete for that matter, realize that their lives will be inexplicably intertwined during their flight and ground time during the end of the war.Pete returns as a sort of spirit to the pilots and aids Ted in becoming the best flyer in the army. But Ted also falls in love with Dorinda, Pete's old flame, and Pete has to choose between letting Dorinda go, or holding onto her and watching her whither into a shell of aloneness.********************************************************************************My biggest issue with this film was that I didn't feel the connection that Pete felt for Dorinda. He just seemed off-ish and brusque. While in ""Always"", Richard Dreyfuss' character really made me aware of how strongly Pete felt for Dorinda.I also didn't care for ""Heaven"" -- or whatever it was supposed to represent when Spencer Tracy died -- being a military style place. In ""Always"", Audrey Hepburn plays Richard Dreyfuss' Heaven and Earth go-between with no ties to anything military or government related. A nice adjustment and screenplay alteration.There was also a lot more subtle humor in ""Always"" that made me feel more connected with the characters than in ""A Guy Named Joe.""This isn't to say that I didn't enjoy ""A Guy Named Joe."" I did.

280229,A1NTIRBM2X0OVU,6301969162,John &#34;Silence is Golden&#34;,"[3, 5]","""A Guy Named Joe"" was one of biggest box office winners of 1944. It has a stellar cast, a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, its director is Victor Fleming {Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz} and it is scrumpcously photographed by ace cameramen George Folsey and Karl Freund. This is a big budget, top quality, ""A Class"" picture AND despite all these assets - it is a overlong somewhat pretensious World War 11 melodrama that has some serious miscasting and screenplay issues and in viewing this film I found it to be somewhat of a disappointment.Spencer Tracy {Pete Sandidge} is too old and overweight to play a young ""hotshot pilot"". Irene Dunne is too old {at 45 + years} to play ""Dorinda"" a  young seasoned pilot in love with Pete and after Pete's untimely death has hotshot pilot # 2 Van Johnson {Tex Randall} enamoured of her even though he is almost 20 years her junior - this some very strange casting and MGM had any # of younger actresses who would have been more realistically and better cast -  Donna Reed, Ann Southern and Marsha Hunt were all long term MGM contract actresses who would have been avaliable.The storyline is simple. Pete is a reckless combat pilot who in an act of heroism {or reckless stupidity?} sacrifices his plane [and crew} and sinks an enemy aircraft carrier and goes to heaven !! {Heaven after committing suicide ?} where he meets ""The General"" an ancient Lionel Barrymore who assigns him the mission as a benevolent, unseen ""spirit mentor"" to watch over the pilots of his squadron and influence them to make the right descisions while in flight training and in combat. Pete takes a particular interest in Tex and steers this raw talented youngster thru the travails of his inexperience and ""period of immortality"" in thinking nothing can ever happen to him with Pete realizing that Tex is a young pilot cast exactly in his mold/mindset when he first became a pilot.The supporting cast is excellent and includes Barry Nelson, Esther Williams, Ward Bond, Don Defore and James Gleason. S. Tracy despite being miscast gives a interesting performance and give a subtle, restrained performance as the spirit guiding Tex talking him thru his headstrong recklessness to become the responsible pilot/leader he needs to become. Pete also has to work on a grieving Dornida to convince put her love for him behind her and move on - this is the wartime love and death aspect in the screenplay that falls very flat and leads to the rather contrived and farfetched climax of the movie. Irene Dunne's performance is by degrees too coy, strained and overwrought and it is not one of her better efforts .This is the movie that made Van Johnson a star and during production when he suffered major injuries {and nearly died} from an automobile accident it was S. Tracy who refused to continue to play in the movie until Johnson was ready to resume filming. It was one of the most generous gestures that Tracy ever extended to a young actor - it saved Johnson's career and Johnson never ceased to be gratefull to Tracy for his kindness and how he used his ""star power"" and stood up for Johnson against the MGM top brass who wanted to replace him.I love World War 11 movies that were made during the war years but this one rings ""Kind of Hollow"" and {in my opinion} does not hold up very well !! This is a strange, hybrid, mixed bag of a movie and despite good direction from Victor Fleming and outstnading production values - the casting, screenplay and other flaws prevent me from giving it more than a lukewarm 3 star rating",3,A Curiously Unsatisfying World War 11 Melodrama:,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,3540,"['Guy', 'Named', 'Joe', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'box', 'office', 'winners', '1944', 'stellar', 'cast', 'screenplay', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'director', 'Victor', 'Fleming', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'scrumpcously', 'photographed', 'ace', 'cameramen', 'George', 'Folsey', 'Karl', 'Freund', 'big', 'budget', 'top', 'quality', 'Class', 'picture', 'assets', 'overlong', 'somewhat', 'pretensious', 'World', 'War', '11', 'melodrama', 'serious', 'miscasting', 'screenplay', 'issues', 'viewing', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disappointment.Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Pete', 'Sandidge', 'too', 'old', 'overweight', 'play', 'young', 'hotshot', 'pilot', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'too', 'old', '45', '+', 'years', 'play', 'Dorinda', 'young', 'seasoned', 'pilot', 'love', 'Pete', 'Pete', 'untimely', 'death', 'hotshot', 'pilot', '2', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Tex', 'Randall', 'enamoured', 'even', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'junior', 'very', 'strange', 'casting', 'MGM', 'had', 'younger', 'actresses', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'realistically', 'better', 'cast', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Ann', 'Southern', 'Marsha', 'Hunt', 'were', 'long', 'term', 'MGM', 'contract', 'actresses', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'avaliable.The', 'storyline', 'simple', 'Pete', 'reckless', 'combat', 'pilot', 'who', 'act', 'heroism', 'reckless', 'stupidity', 'plane', '[', 'crew', 'enemy', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'heaven', 'Heaven', 'committing', 'suicide', 'where', 'General', 'ancient', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'mission', 'benevolent', 'unseen', 'spirit', 'mentor', 'watch', 'pilots', 'squadron', 'influence', 'make', 'right', 'descisions', 'flight', 'training', 'combat', 'Pete', 'particular', 'interest', 'Tex', 'steers', 'raw', 'talented', 'youngster', 'travails', 'inexperience', 'period', 'immortality', 'thinking', 'nothing', 'can', 'ever', 'happen', 'Pete', 'realizing', 'Tex', 'young', 'pilot', 'cast', 'exactly', 'mold/mindset', 'when', 'first', 'became', 'pilot.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Barry', 'Nelson', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Don', 'Defore', 'James', 'Gleason', 'S.', 'Tracy', 'being', 'miscast', 'interesting', 'performance', 'give', 'subtle', 'restrained', 'performance', 'spirit', 'guiding', 'Tex', 'talking', 'thru', 'headstrong', 'recklessness', 'become', 'responsible', 'pilot/leader', 'become', 'Pete', 'also', 'work', 'grieving', 'Dornida', 'convince', 'put', 'love', 'move', 'wartime', 'love', 'death', 'aspect', 'screenplay', 'very', 'flat', 'rather', 'contrived', 'farfetched', 'climax', 'movie', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'performance', 'degrees', 'too', 'coy', 'strained', 'overwrought', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'efforts', '.This', 'movie', 'made', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'star', 'production', 'when', 'suffered', 'major', 'injuries', 'nearly', 'died', 'automobile', 'accident', 'was', 'S.', 'Tracy', 'who', 'refused', 'continue', 'play', 'movie', 'Johnson', 'was', 'ready', 'resume', 'filming', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'generous', 'gestures', 'Tracy', 'ever', 'extended', 'young', 'actor', 'saved', 'Johnson', 'career', 'Johnson', 'never', 'ceased', 'be', 'gratefull', 'Tracy', 'kindness', 'how', 'used', 'star', 'power', 'stood', 'up', 'Johnson', 'MGM', 'top', 'brass', 'who', 'wanted', 'replace', 'him.I', 'love', 'World', 'War', '11', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'war', 'years', 'one', 'Kind', 'Hollow', 'opinion', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'strange', 'hybrid', 'mixed', 'bag', 'movie', 'good', 'direction', 'Victor', 'Fleming', 'outstnading', 'production', 'values', 'casting', 'screenplay', 'other', 'flaws', 'prevent', 'giving', 'more', 'lukewarm', '3', 'star', 'rating']",A Guy Named Joe VHS
280230,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,6301969162,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[9, 9]","A GUY NAMED JOE is a wonderful, old-fashioned, patriotic film made in 1944 during WWII.  Starring Spencer Tracy, Irene Dunne, Van Johnson, Ward Bond, and Lionel Barrymore, A GUY NAMED JOE is the story of Pete (Tracy), a hot shot bomber pilot, who dies when he purposefully crashes his disabled plane into a German aircraft carrier.  Dorinda (Dunne), Pete's girl friend and a pilot with the Women's Air Ferrying Corps, is devastated, especially since she has just convinced Pete to take a safer assignment stateside teaching new recruits how to fly.  In Heaven, which looks remarkably like an Army airfield only with soft, fluffy, white clouds on the ground, ""The Commanding General"" (Barrymore) makes Pete a guardian angel to Ted Randall (Johnson), a young, unsure Army pilot.  Pete invisibly helps Ted through flight training and combat.  Ted eventually picks of some of Pete's quirks and style, becoming quite a hot shot pilot himself.  Of course, he eventually meets and falls in love with Dorinda, making Pete very jealous.  Dorinda is still devoted to Pete's memory, but she, too, eventually falls for Ted.  In the end, however, Pete lets Dorinda go, saving Dorinda, Ted, and even his own soul.This sweet, sentimental film combines the war genre with romantic fantasy.  Directed by Victor Fleming and written by Dalton Trumbo, the script is wry and witty with both Spencer Tracy and Irene Dunne delivering some great lines (hence the title of this review). Tracy, Dunne, and Johnson are all believable in their respective roles as well as what you expect them to be as actors.  Barrymore is classic as ""The Commanding General,"" and I loved Ward Bond as Pete and Dorinda's best friend.  Considering this was filmed in 1944, the special effects are admirable and what you would expect from that era.  Apparently, there are several inaccuracies in this film (e.g.  there weren't any German aircraft carriers in WWII), but I simply did not care.A GUY NAME JOE is a terrific choice for a pleasant, sappy, nostalgic evening at home.  You may need a hanky in a few spots.  But watching this classic film, both my husband and I found smiles on our faces for most of the evening.Side notes:  There is no character named Joe in this film.  At the beginning some hero-worshipping kids explain that pilots in the Army Air Corps call any ""right fellow"" Joe.  Also, A GUY NAMED JOE was remade in 1989 by Steven Spielberg as the movie ALWAYS.",5,"""Girl clothes!  From London!

Spencer Tracy should never have been shoe-horned by MGM into this piece of drivel. Wartime cinemagoers may have been conned into accepting such fantasies, but in retrospect this movie really bombed. When Tracy dies while crashing his B-25 into a German aircraft carrier, I realised that the fantasy lay in MGM producers failing to realise that Germany had only one carrier, the 'Graf Zepelin' which was never involved in any naval activity. Tracy is no romantic lead and it comes as no surprise that on his demise he is supplanted by Van Johnson. What the two stars illustrate in this film is their brashness and rashness. Ward Bond plays the role of Tracy's best friend during his lifetime, while Barry Nelson is his mentor in the afterlife. Lionel Barrymore as the 'heavenly' general is as brusque as usual despite his occasional lapses into lyricism, while Esther Williams makes a brief appearance as Johnson's dancing partner. The only part of the movie which appealed to me was Irene Dunn singing 'I'll Get By' to the accompaniment of Bond on his harmonica. Tracy had a more successful role as a B-25 pilot the following year in 'Thirty Seconds over Tokyo', where Van Johnson also appeared, but this time without dancing because he had lost both his legs.",2,flight of fancy,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,1459,"['idea', 'Irene', 'Dunn', 'piloting', 'P-38', 'fighter-bomber', 'blow', 'up', 'Japanese', 'ammunition', 'dump', 'just', 'as', 'preposterous', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'role', 'Russian', 'jet', 'pilot', 'film', 'name', 'Jet', 'Pilot', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'shoe-horned', 'MGM', 'piece', 'drivel', 'Wartime', 'cinemagoers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'conned', 'accepting', 'such', 'fantasies', 'retrospect', 'movie', 'really', 'bombed', 'When', 'Tracy', 'crashing', 'B-25', 'German', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'realised', 'fantasy', 'lay', 'MGM', 'producers', 'failing', 'realise', 'Germany', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'carrier', ""'Graf"", 'Zepelin', 'was', 'never', 'involved', 'naval', 'activity', 'Tracy', 'romantic', 'lead', 'surprise', 'demise', 'supplanted', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'What', 'two', 'stars', 'illustrate', 'film', 'brashness', 'rashness', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'role', 'Tracy', 'best', 'friend', 'lifetime', 'Barry', 'Nelson', 'mentor', 'afterlife', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', ""'heavenly"", 'general', 'as', 'brusque', 'usual', 'occasional', 'lapses', 'lyricism', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Johnson', 'dancing', 'partner', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'appealed', 'was', 'Irene', 'Dunn', 'singing', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'accompaniment', 'Bond', 'harmonica', 'Tracy', 'had', 'more', 'successful', 'role', 'B-25', 'pilot', 'following', 'year', ""'Thirty"", 'Seconds', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'also', 'appeared', 'time', 'dancing', 'had', 'lost', 'legs']",A Guy Named Joe VHS
280234,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6301969162,magellan,"[7, 10]","This movie is sort of like the flying-ace version of Angels on My Shoulder. It's unusual for a Spencer Tracy film in that he dies in the first half of the movie, goes to heaven, comes back to earth to help rookie pilots, and doesn't get his girl. Instead, Van Johnson, the young flyer he's sent to shepherd, gets her and they live happily ever after, presumably.There are some unusual aspects to the plot. Tracy is assigned to assist Van Johnson during training, but Johnson isn't the sort of guy Tracy would normally hang out with or even like. For example, we're told he's rich and just inherited 4 million dollars. When Johnson gets sent to New Guinea to fly in the south Pacific, he meets Irene Dunne, Tracy's former love, and Johnson starts putting moves on her, another reason for Tracy to dislike his assigned pilot.But Johnson turns out to be a better guy for Irene than Tracy was, and Tracy even seems to sense or realize that, and at the end of the film, he finally lets her go.There are some nicely done battle scenes in the movie, and the one where Dunne takes up the P38 and successfully completes a solo suicide mission Van Johnson was sent to do is notable in that this was a long time before women's lib. Dunne shows that she can fly as well as any man, and along with the scene where Tracy goes down taking out the German aircraft carrier (which the Germans never had), is one of the two most climactic battle scenes in the movie. Dunne shows she can be as good as any man, but still feminine, a role contemporary feminists don't seem to approve of.All in all a decent movie with some interesting aspects to the characters and plot.

280238,A2JYIDH7JIG48H,6301969162,"R. Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[34, 36]","A Guy Named Joe is THE classic movie about a cracked up WWII bomber pilot (Spencer Tracy) sent back from Heaven as a ghost to provide guidance, like a guardian angel, to a new pilot trainee who turns out to fall in love with the ghost's girlfriend (Irene Dunne).  I think this is the only movie in which Spencer Tracy played opposite Irene Dunne, who was one of the classiest leading ladies of her time (The Awful Truth, Penny Serenade, Life With Father, I Remember Mama, Anna and the King of Siam, The Mudlark, etc.).The stellar supporting cast includes Van Johnson (Brigadoon, The Pied Piper of Hamlin), James Gleason (Here Comes Mr. Jordan, The Bishop's Wife), Lionel Barrymore (On Borrowed Time, It's A Wonderful Life), Ward Bond (Sgt. York, The Searchers), Don Defore (The Human Comedy, Ramrod), Barry Nelson (Airport, The Shining), and Esther Williams, soon to become a star in a class of her own (Bathing Beauty, Take Me Out To The Ball Game).  Unfortunately remade as ""Always"" - nothing against Richard Dreyfuss, but he's no Spencer Tracy, and ditto the rest of the respective casts.In addition to well-acted fantastic romance, there are some great air combat scenes, some of the best of its time. (Van Johnson also appeared with Spencer Tracy in Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo the same year.)If you like fantasies like Heaven Can Wait, That's The Spirit, The Dust Factory, Beyond Tomorrow, etc., you must see this one.  If you're a fan of Spencer Tracy or a movie buff who likes a lot of character actors, you must see this movie.

280239,A2FA18B50XGXJX,6301969162,Sam Damon Jr.,"[45, 58]","&quot;A guy named Joe&quot; (AGNJ) should not be compared to Spielberg's &quot;Always&quot;, because they are different pictures. AGNJ in the first half is about flying and Spencer Tracy's love for IT, not so much Irene Dunne. Its highly amusing to see him die by crashing into a German aircraft carrier when the Germans never put one into service. In Always, you really do sense that Richard Dreyfuss loves Holly Hunter. Its Irene Dunne's character that is stuck on Joe, and its wonderful to see her in the movie maintaing her professional poise as a ferry pilot while Van Johnson is hitting on her. In fact, I know a young woman who reminds me exactly of her, who holds a deep loss in her heart but maintains a professional bearing.Its Van Johnson who makes her want to live again, and in the best scene of the movie, she realizes he ain't gonna make it when he's assigned a suicide attack mission in his P-38. What's amazing is this in the 1940s, but Irene Dunne jumps into his P-38 and flies the mission INCLUDING dropping bombs and firing machine guns at the enemy. Its startling to see and you don't see any feminists rushing to praise this picture. Its because she's a professional, a sexy woman AND a warrior, not a bitter man-hater. Like I suspect many from &quot;America's greatest generation&quot; she knew the enemy had to be defeated or else tyranny would rule the earth and instead of complaining pitched in and helped. Her goal was to help not be a female version of a male &quot;Top Gun&quot; egotist.
