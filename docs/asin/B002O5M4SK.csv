Suffice it to say that it is a great rendition of Spiderman and well worth it for any fan to pick up.  What I want to pass along is that at least now (with the most recent lower prices on each disc) it is worthwhile to actually buy these as separate volumes.  If you want Season 2 (the last season) of Spectacular Spiderman you need to pick it up as four separate discs (Vol 5, 6, 7, and 8).  Each disc is now priced at approximately $7 so a full season still costs more than it should have, but if you are a fan of the show I think you will think it is worth it.

This like the series itself is a victim of the ambiguous licensing war between Sony & Marvel/Disney.
