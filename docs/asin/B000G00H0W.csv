997741,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000G00H0W,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[26, 30]","It's hard to describe `Romance and Cigarettes' without sounding weird or schmaltzy, but it's a rock solid romantic comedy that's driven by its offbeat dialogue and characters.  Produced by the Coen Brothers, but directed and written by veteran actor John Turturro, the film still feels like a Coen Brothers' venture if they made musical comedies, which, partly, they do.To give you a flavor of the movie, it starts off with Constance Murder (Mary-Louise Parker) walking up to her unfaithful father, Nick (James Gandolfini, 'The Sopranos') who's asleep on the couch in their modest NY suburban home, snoring away like a slow moving saw.  Her arms are akimbo and her face sports disapproval, yet she seems to show compassion as the mounting evidence comes in for yet another mistress and another affair, which is written all over her face.  She walks up to him and puts her lit cigarette between his toes.  She walks out of the room, and after a pregnant pause, we hear him yell out in pain.His daughters are on mom, (Susan Sarandon) Katie Murder's side, so she's really wronged in a one-sided way.  She wears her anguish on her sleeve and in song (as she reconnects with her local Catholic church choir.)  One of the best scenes is when they wiggle and grind through a steamy rendition of ""Take Another Piece of My Heart"".  (You know, the one Janis Joplin made so famous).  One of her daughters has all the looks she may have lost, is in a rock band, and is steady with her dancer boyfriend (Duck-tail flamboyant Bobby Cannavale) who also co-fronts the band.On his way to work, Nick sings along with the soundtrack, so his voice absurdly blends in Karaoke style with Engelbert Humperdinck's ""A Man Without Love"" in a lavishly choreographed neighborhood scene.  The juxtaposition of fantasy with mundane reality must be a Hollywood trend, for I kept thinking of `Across the Universe' here or `Enchanted' and `Hairspray'.  Yet, it would be unfair for me to keep those connections too strong here, for I felt like I was watching something uniquely sublime and daffy.There isn't really much of plot, per se, except for the ramifications of his British adulterous interest (Kate Winslet), but the character study is enough to keep the pages turning.  Nick is able to confide with fellow hardhat Angelo (Steve Buscemi) whose lecherous confessions on the job are both grim and practical, and Katie relies on her quirky cousin (Christopher Walken) to boost her spirits and keep her sense of purpose in life.Much like the aforementioned films, `Romance and Cigarettes' uses musical comedy to rise about the dingy skylines and heart rending realities with some fun fantasies that both escape one's lot in life and process the wounds.  I'd say after all is said and done, this is a fun and colorful film that is a real pleasure to watch.(Happy belated Valentine's Day!)",4,"""Love Stinks""",1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,2857,"['hard', 'describe', 'Romance', 'Cigarettes', 'sounding', 'weird', 'schmaltzy', 'rock', 'solid', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'driven', 'offbeat', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'Produced', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'directed', 'written', 'veteran', 'actor', 'John', 'Turturro', 'film', 'still', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'venture', 'made', 'musical', 'comedies', 'partly', 'do.To', 'give', 'flavor', 'movie', 'Constance', 'Murder', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'walking', 'up', 'unfaithful', 'father', 'Nick', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Sopranos', 'who', 'asleep', 'couch', 'modest', 'NY', 'suburban', 'home', 'snoring', 'away', 'slow', 'moving', 'saw', 'arms', 'are', 'akimbo', 'face', 'sports', 'disapproval', 'yet', 'show', 'compassion', 'mounting', 'evidence', 'yet', 'mistress', 'affair', 'written', 'face', 'walks', 'up', 'lit', 'cigarette', 'toes', 'walks', 'room', 'pregnant', 'pause', 'hear', 'yell', 'out', 'pain.His', 'daughters', 'are', 'mom', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Katie', 'Murder', 'side', 'really', 'wronged', 'one-sided', 'way', 'anguish', 'sleeve', 'song', 'local', 'Catholic', 'church', 'choir', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'when', 'wiggle', 'grind', 'steamy', 'rendition', 'Take', 'Piece', 'My', 'Heart', 'know', 'one', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'made', 'so', 'famous', 'One', 'daughters', 'looks', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'rock', 'band', 'steady', 'dancer', 'boyfriend', 'Duck-tail', 'flamboyant', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'who', 'also', 'co-fronts', 'band.On', 'way', 'work', 'Nick', 'sings', 'soundtrack', 'voice', 'absurdly', 'Karaoke', 'style', 'Engelbert', 'Humperdinck', 'A', 'Man', 'Love', 'lavishly', 'choreographed', 'neighborhood', 'scene', 'juxtaposition', 'fantasy', 'mundane', 'reality', 'must', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'trend', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Universe', 'here', 'Enchanted', 'Hairspray', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'keep', 'connections', 'too', 'strong', 'here', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'uniquely', 'sublime', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'plot', 'se', 'ramifications', 'British', 'adulterous', 'interest', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'character', 'study', 'enough', 'keep', 'pages', 'turning', 'Nick', 'able', 'confide', 'fellow', 'hardhat', 'Angelo', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'lecherous', 'confessions', 'job', 'are', 'grim', 'practical', 'Katie', 'relies', 'quirky', 'cousin', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'boost', 'spirits', 'keep', 'sense', 'purpose', 'life.Much', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'Romance', 'Cigarettes', 'uses', 'musical', 'comedy', 'rise', 'dingy', 'skylines', 'heart', 'rending', 'realities', 'fun', 'fantasies', 'escape', 'one', 'lot', 'life', 'process', 'wounds', ""'d"", 'say', 'said', 'done', 'fun', 'colorful', 'film', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Happy', 'belated', 'Valentine', 'Day']",N/A
997742,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000G00H0W,Andrew Ellington,"[40, 41]","Musicals have become all the rage lately (I feel so weird saying `all the rage') and `Romance & Cigarettes' is yet another in the long line; but there is something different about this `musical', something that makes it stand apart as superior to the rest.  John Turturro's `Romance & Cigarettes' is one of the strangest musicals I've ever seen, one that is definitely not for every palate but one that is sure to find it's cult following and devoted fans.  It's abrasive, crude and ultimately unforgettable.  The tagline for this film's is `A Savage Musical' and while that may sum up the film in part there is really so much heart here that it seems unjust to classify it as `savage'.`Romance & Cigarettes' follows blue collar worker Nick Murder as he juggles his relationships with the women in his life.  His marriage to Kitty is falling apart, mostly due to his relationship with vixen Tula.  His daughters Baby, Constance and Rosebud despise him for what he has done to their mother and his girlfriend Tula is challenging him in ways he didn't know he could be challenged.  And then there is his mother who will never forgive him for becoming his father.  While Nick is sorting out his life Kitty is trying to find herself.  She visits the church of which she's all but forsaken.  She contemplates handling Tula on her own, for good.  She battles her feelings about her husband as well as those about her dead ex-lover.`Romance & Cigarettes' plays out like a musical meets a black romantic comedy meets a crime noir meets a family drama.  The `musical' elements are open song where characters either sing along or lip synch to pop ballads; where musical numbers are performed in the middle of the street complete with choreographed dancing.  The minute Gandolfini walks out the front door singing `A Man Without Love' you know you're in for a treat.  It's definitely `out there' but it all fits together in such an oddly fulfilling way that you can't help but embrace it.The performances are stellar, truly stellar.  James Gandolfini almost reprises his role of Tony Soprano when you really think about it.  Sure, he's not a mobster but his family life (the cheating, the sick form of loyalty to his mate, the sympathetic failure) is pretty similar.  He nails it, but that's to be expected.  Susan Sarandon also nails her part as the eccentric down trodden mother.  Her performance is similar to her role in `Igby Goes Down' (another SOLID piece of work).  Mandy Moore, Mary-Louise Parker and Aida Turturro all deliver fine performances as the three daughters, Parker standing out due to her scene stealing antics.  Christopher Walken is hilarious as Cousin Bo and Elaine Stritch has a noteworthy cameo as Nick's mother.Standout here though is none other than Kate Winslet.  Her performance as the dirty mouthed Tula is outstanding.  The things that come out of her mouth are so horrible yet she says them with such calm and ease you can't help but believe every word.  How she made it through her dialog without gagging on her own laughter is beyond me.  How she was passed over for an Oscar nomination is also beyond me.`Romance & Cigarettes' is one of those films that stays with you whether you like it or not.  It's imaginative and original and completely ridiculous in a manor that makes you want to be a part of this crazy world somehow.  With stellar performances that elevate the screenplay and tender moments that add layers of emotional depth to the chaos on screen, `Romance & Cigarettes' is definitely worth the ride.",5,Unlike any musical you've ever seen...,1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,3536,"['Musicals', 'have', 'become', 'rage', 'lately', 'feel', 'so', 'weird', 'saying', 'rage', 'Romance', 'Cigarettes', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'something', 'different', 'musical', 'something', 'stand', 'apart', 'superior', 'rest', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Romance', 'Cigarettes', 'one', 'strangest', 'musicals', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'definitely', 'not', 'palate', 'one', 'sure', 'find', 'cult', 'following', 'devoted', 'fans', 'abrasive', 'crude', 'ultimately', 'unforgettable', 'tagline', 'film', 'Savage', 'Musical', 'may', 'sum', 'up', 'film', 'part', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'here', 'unjust', 'classify', ""savage'."", 'Romance', 'Cigarettes', 'blue', 'collar', 'worker', 'Nick', 'Murder', 'relationships', 'women', 'life', 'marriage', 'Kitty', 'falling', 'apart', 'mostly', 'due', 'relationship', 'vixen', 'Tula', 'daughters', 'Baby', 'Constance', 'Rosebud', 'despise', 'what', 'done', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'Tula', 'challenging', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'be', 'challenged', 'then', 'mother', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'forgive', 'becoming', 'father', 'Nick', 'sorting', 'out', 'life', 'Kitty', 'trying', 'find', 'church', 'forsaken', 'handling', 'Tula', 'own', 'good', 'feelings', 'husband', 'as', 'well', 'dead', 'ex-lover.', 'Romance', 'Cigarettes', 'plays', 'musical', 'black', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'meets', 'crime', 'noir', 'family', 'drama', 'musical', 'elements', 'are', 'open', 'song', 'where', 'characters', 'sing', 'along', 'lip', 'synch', 'pop', 'ballads', 'where', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'performed', 'middle', 'street', 'complete', 'choreographed', 'dancing', 'minute', 'Gandolfini', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'singing', 'Man', 'Love', 'know', ""'re"", 'treat', 'definitely', 'there', 'together', 'such', 'oddly', 'fulfilling', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'embrace', 'it.The', 'performances', 'are', 'stellar', 'truly', 'stellar', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'almost', 'role', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'when', 'really', 'think', 'Sure', 'not', 'mobster', 'family', 'life', 'cheating', 'sick', 'form', 'loyalty', 'mate', 'sympathetic', 'failure', 'pretty', 'similar', 'be', 'expected', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'also', 'part', 'eccentric', 'down', 'trodden', 'mother', 'performance', 'similar', 'role', 'Igby', 'Goes', 'Down', 'SOLID', 'piece', 'work', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Aida', 'Turturro', 'deliver', 'fine', 'performances', 'three', 'daughters', 'Parker', 'standing', 'out', 'due', 'scene', 'stealing', 'antics', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'hilarious', 'Cousin', 'Bo', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'noteworthy', 'cameo', 'Nick', 'mother.Standout', 'here', 'none', 'other', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'dirty', 'mouthed', 'Tula', 'outstanding', 'things', 'come', 'mouth', 'are', 'so', 'horrible', 'yet', 'such', 'calm', 'ease', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'believe', 'word', 'How', 'made', 'dialog', 'gagging', 'own', 'laughter', 'How', 'was', 'passed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'also', 'me.', 'Romance', 'Cigarettes', 'one', 'films', 'not', 'imaginative', 'original', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'manor', 'want', 'be', 'part', 'crazy', 'world', 'somehow', 'stellar', 'performances', 'elevate', 'screenplay', 'tender', 'moments', 'add', 'layers', 'emotional', 'depth', 'chaos', 'screen', 'Romance', 'Cigarettes', 'definitely', 'worth', 'ride']",N/A

The film contains enough interesting moments that it should be checked out.  There are scene-stealing moments from Winslet, Steve Buscemi, Elaine Stritch, and Christopher Walken who does a mean ""Delilah"".

If there were no-name actors in this and it was being made by producers & directors & writers making their first movie you could understand some of the excess and horribleness you'll see, but when you consider that Academy Award winning actors & actresses & producers are involved in this you're simply in disbelief. It's a good thing James Gandolfini made this after he made The Sopranos, because I don't think he'd ever work again after folks saw this. I'm not quite sure where to start.....You don't connect with any of the characters, who are really only caricatures. It was as if Turturro was working in every wacky character into this film in fear that he'd never get a chance to make another movie.If Mary Louise Parker & Mandy Moore & Aida Turturro & Amy Sedaris were trying to top each other in awfulness, they all win. Except they'd be 2nd behind Bobby Carnavale.I always thought that Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken are great in everything. Here I learn that they're only as good as their material, and this material stinks. John Turturro managed to make a movie with Steve Buscemi & Christopher Walken that is horrible. I think anybody else could have made something half decent with only one of them.What Kate Winslet was doing with James Gandolfini, and why she was so over the top, escapes me.This was such a train wreck I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Until I had to. At that point I just tried to click on the singing & dancing scenes. Because as bad as this movie is, I did enjoy some of the singing & dancing. Maybe if the movie ONLY had that it would have been OK. Susan Sarandon looked great. Like a real woman should look. It was fun seeing Kate Winslet in her Mae West persona, but she was just too way out.I'm probably extra disappointed because there aren't many movies on Amazon Prime that have Academy Award winners in them.

Set in New Jersey-like area, this is a story of a working class family with three adult daughters at the moemnt that the husband and father or the family (James Gandolfini) is caught cheating on his wife (Susan Sarandon).  The rage that transpires from his wife, is like a virus that catches on to all his daughters and even his own mother.However, it is Kate Winslet who steals the show.  She is the seductress that prefers emotionally unavailble men and they turn her on for as long as they are not in love with her.  Once they do fall in love, the affair is over.  Winslet has so much fun in this movie that it is hillarious to listen to her speak with ehr British accent, make love (to Gandolfini's character) and get into a cat fight with no ther woman ut Susan Sarandon!  In one scene, she is thrown into a water by Gandolfini's character and she looks like a mermaid with her flaming red hair, beautifully sculpted face and most amazing costume made up of Agent Provocateour underwear.It is a funny movie with really cool choreography and mix of musical scores.  Even the people who are not fans of musicals (myself included) will enjoy this goofball movie.",4,Goofballs getting at each other,1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,1282,"['Film', 'John', 'Turturro', 'part', 'musical', 'part', 'comedy', 'most', 'fantastically', 'assembled', 'cast', 'one', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'Set', 'New', 'Jersey-like', 'area', 'story', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'three', 'adult', 'daughters', 'moemnt', 'husband', 'father', 'family', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'caught', 'cheating', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'rage', 'wife', 'virus', 'daughters', 'even', 'own', 'mother.However', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'show', 'seductress', 'prefers', 'emotionally', 'unavailble', 'men', 'turn', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'not', 'love', 'do', 'fall', 'love', 'affair', 'Winslet', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'movie', 'hillarious', 'listen', 'speak', 'ehr', 'British', 'accent', 'make', 'love', 'Gandolfini', 'character', 'get', 'cat', 'fight', 'ther', 'woman', 'ut', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'one', 'scene', 'thrown', 'water', 'Gandolfini', 'character', 'mermaid', 'flaming', 'red', 'hair', 'beautifully', 'sculpted', 'face', 'most', 'amazing', 'costume', 'made', 'Agent', 'Provocateour', 'underwear.It', 'funny', 'movie', 'really', 'cool', 'choreography', 'mix', 'musical', 'scores', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fans', 'musicals', 'included', 'will', 'enjoy', 'goofball', 'movie']",N/A
