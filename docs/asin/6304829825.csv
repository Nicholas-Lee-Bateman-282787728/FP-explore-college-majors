The audiences loved them but the academics, politicians, party leaders and censors barely tolerated them and tried to force them to serve the grim worker mentality of the state.  On the one hand, these musicals are oddly entertaining. On the other, they are a grim reminder of how human happiness and the human spirit is so often strangled by political and religious repressive systems.  People want to laugh, love, and, yes, sing and dance.  Too bad that that is so threatening to so many.

437108,A2DSXA1E02C86D,6304829825,Joseph Haschka,"[6, 6]","My credentials as a fan of screen musicals are suspect. In 56 years, I can count on one hand the number I've seen that I thought worth viewing more than once: CHICAGO (2003), EVITA (1996), HELLO DOLLY (1969), THE KING AND I (1956), and (dare I admit it?) MARY POPPINS (1964). Having said that, however, I found EAST SIDE STORY illuminating. During the Bad Old Days of the Cold War, what average American would've thought that the Warsaw Pact/Evil Empire was making musicals? And had been doing so for many years.EAST SIDE STORY is a documentary roughly covering the period 1930-1970, when the Soviet Union, and its satellites after 1945, struggled to create Hollywood-like entertainment for the proletariat masses without sacrificing the central tenants of socialism. The fact that only forty musicals were filmed during this period suggests that the two concepts blended as efficiently as oil and water.Chronologically, the documentary begins with the 1934 Soviet musical comedy, THE JOLLY FELLOWS, a rather unsocialist production that apparently only made it to the local cinemas after Stalin overrode the censors - a bad career move for them, no doubt - and personally approved it. As a matter of fact, Uncle Joe was a big fan of the genre, and gave a copy of a favorite reel to FDR as a gift. In any case, the visual narrative proceeds through several more Soviet releases, including the 1939 film with the catchy title TRACTOR DRIVERS and the 1946 COSSACKS OF THE KUBAN featuring synchronized wheat harvesting, and ending with the Polish, Czech, Romanian and (mostly) East German musicals of the 50s and 60s. Indeed, the costuming, hairstyles, and choreography of the DDR productions are so similar to Tinseltown fare that, if I squint my eyes against the cheesy sets and block out the German lyrics, I might just as well be watching a teenage beach blanket saga filmed in Southern California.EAST SIDE STORY is liberally sprinkled with interviews with aging actors, production lackeys, and cinema historians. (Early on, it's pointed out that none of the films' directors have survived. A purge maybe, or just old age?) They establish quite clearly the dichotomy that existed between the desire to entertain audiences with big box office hits and the doctrinaire restrictions imposed by socialist ideology that tended to cramp the screenwriter's style. One of those interviewed wistfully observed, ""If only socialism had been more fun."" Gee, I don't know. I can see Stalin reprising Dick van Dyke's role as the dancing chimney sweep in MARY POPPINS, can't you?",4,If only socialism had been more fun,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2565,"['credentials', 'fan', 'screen', 'musicals', 'are', 'suspect', '56', 'years', 'can', 'count', 'one', 'hand', 'number', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thought', 'worth', 'viewing', 'more', 'once', 'CHICAGO', '2003', 'EVITA', '1996', 'HELLO', 'DOLLY', '1969', 'THE', 'KING', 'AND', '1956', 'dare', 'admit', 'MARY', 'POPPINS', '1964', 'Having', 'said', 'however', 'found', 'EAST', 'SIDE', 'STORY', 'illuminating', 'Bad', 'Old', 'Days', 'Cold', 'War', 'what', 'average', 'American', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'Warsaw', 'Pact/Evil', 'Empire', 'was', 'making', 'musicals', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'so', 'many', 'years.EAST', 'SIDE', 'STORY', 'documentary', 'roughly', 'covering', 'period', '1930-1970', 'when', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'satellites', '1945', 'struggled', 'create', 'Hollywood-like', 'entertainment', 'proletariat', 'sacrificing', 'central', 'tenants', 'socialism', 'fact', 'only', 'forty', 'musicals', 'were', 'filmed', 'period', 'two', 'concepts', 'blended', 'as', 'efficiently', 'oil', 'water.Chronologically', 'documentary', '1934', 'Soviet', 'musical', 'comedy', 'THE', 'JOLLY', 'FELLOWS', 'rather', 'unsocialist', 'production', 'apparently', 'only', 'made', 'local', 'cinemas', 'Stalin', 'overrode', 'censors', 'bad', 'career', 'move', 'doubt', 'personally', 'approved', 'matter', 'fact', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'genre', 'gave', 'copy', 'favorite', 'reel', 'FDR', 'gift', 'case', 'visual', 'narrative', 'proceeds', 'several', 'more', 'Soviet', 'releases', 'including', '1939', 'film', 'catchy', 'title', 'TRACTOR', 'DRIVERS', '1946', 'COSSACKS', 'THE', 'KUBAN', 'featuring', 'synchronized', 'wheat', 'harvesting', 'ending', 'Polish', 'Czech', 'Romanian', 'mostly', 'East', 'German', 'musicals', '50s', '60s', 'Indeed', 'costuming', 'hairstyles', 'choreography', 'DDR', 'productions', 'are', 'so', 'similar', 'Tinseltown', 'fare', 'squint', 'eyes', 'cheesy', 'sets', 'block', 'out', 'German', 'lyrics', 'might', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'watching', 'teenage', 'beach', 'blanket', 'saga', 'filmed', 'Southern', 'California.EAST', 'SIDE', 'STORY', 'liberally', 'sprinkled', 'interviews', 'aging', 'actors', 'production', 'lackeys', 'cinema', 'historians', 'Early', 'pointed', 'out', 'none', 'films', 'directors', 'have', 'survived', 'purge', 'maybe', 'just', 'old', 'age', 'establish', 'quite', 'clearly', 'dichotomy', 'existed', 'desire', 'entertain', 'audiences', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'hits', 'doctrinaire', 'restrictions', 'imposed', 'socialist', 'ideology', 'tended', 'cramp', 'screenwriter', 'style', 'One', 'interviewed', 'wistfully', 'observed', 'only', 'socialism', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'Gee', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'see', 'Stalin', 'reprising', 'Dick', 'van', 'Dyke', 'role', 'dancing', 'chimney', 'sweep', 'MARY', 'POPPINS', 'ca', ""n't""]",N/A

It is very frustrating to find out after my own further research that the amount of these movies that are actually available today can be counted on the fingers of one hand.It is a bit sad that these films were never considered as `art' when they were released, as it means that many of them were just forgotten after the fall of communism. The people involved had a hard enough time making them in the first place and they deserve recognition for their achievements.I also liked the funny anecdotes from this movie, such as Stalin liking to laugh it up with funny movies and having a fantasy for `boys photographing tractors'. The views of the audience members interviewed were also great to hear as you don't normally hear their opinions in this sort of documentary.This documentary comes very highly recommended and I had been wanting to buy a copy for ages and also track down some of the movies shown in it even if I have order off amazon.de and watch them without subtitles.",5,Tractor!
