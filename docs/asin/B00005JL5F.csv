595620,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JL5F,A Customer,"[0, 3]","Summary:Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) and Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) just happen to meet when neither of them can really afford to, because when they do, all hell breaks loose.  Gavin is a high-powered attorney on his way to cheat a charity out of millions of dollars.  Doyle is an insurance salesman and a recovering alcoholic who is about to lose his children in a custody hearing.  When Gavin swerves into Doyle on the freeway while distracted on his cell phone, Doyle tries to do what is right by getting Gavin to exchange insurance information.  But Gavin is in such a hurry that instead he simply offers Doyle a blank check.  And even though they are headed to the same courthouse Gavin refuses to offer Doyle a ride.  As it turns out Gavin leaves the major document in his court case at the scene of the accident where Doyle picks it up.  Doyle, not having a ride, rushes to the courthouse but is too late to prevent his wife from gaining complete custody of the kids so she can move out of state and prevent him from seeing them anymore.Gavin, to save his job and prevent himself from going to prison, needs the folder with the documents from Doyle.  Doyle is upset with Gavin because if he hadn't run into him or, even then, if Gavin had given him a ride, Doyle wouldn't be loosing his kids.  What results is an hour and a half of two men vacillating between trying to kill each other and then trying to help each other for an a very long day.My Comments:First of all, the acting wasn't atrocious, which to me is surprising seeing as how Ben Affleck is, well, a mediocre actor at best (don't believe me? watch Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).  And Samuel L. Jackson is typically only good when he is violent, which he does get to do occasionally in this movie; otherwise I don't think he can't really act (don't believe me? watch Star Wars: Episode I).  So, the movie was actually surprising in terms of the acting, perhaps because I didn't have very high hopes to begin with.The story idea was actually kind of interesting, but only after they tried to really hurt the other person the first time.  After the five millionth time they tried to hurt the other person the movie lost my interest completely.  I was continuously staring at the time counter to see how long the movie was going to continue, and it just kept going and going.  What's worse, nothing is ever really resolved in a satisfactory way - Gavin is still a crook, but what's worse, he blackmails his bosses who are crooks (making him doubly crooked?).Which leads to the next point, the whole subplot of Gavin finding out that he is a 'dirty' lawyer was pretty [weak].  It was almost as though the director of the movie realized that the main plot was only worth about 50 minutes of screen time so he had to come up with some pretty [weak] subplots to fill up another 40 to 50 minutes.After the movie was over my wife was convinced that she had just lost nearly two hours of time - time that was completely wasted.  When I pressed her for what she thought, her first comment was, ""Do you really think people would behave that way?""  My response, ""Well, would we really want to watch a movie where the people were normal?""  But, I must admit, the movie was remarkably far-fetched, at least from my perspective.  I'm not a New Yorker and I've never been to New York, so perhaps the portrayal of these two New Yorkers as vicious, almost homicidal, maniacs was accurate, but I highly doubt it.Anyway, I think you could possibly enjoy this movie if you watched about the first 30 minutes then about the last ten.  The repeated attacks back and forth are tedious, pointless, and tiresome.  I don't recommend this movie unless you enjoy road rage.",2,Too long.,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,3717,"['Summary', 'Gavin', 'Banek', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Doyle', 'Gipson', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'just', 'happen', 'meet', 'when', 'can', 'really', 'afford', 'when', 'do', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Gavin', 'high-powered', 'attorney', 'way', 'cheat', 'charity', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Doyle', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'lose', 'children', 'custody', 'hearing', 'When', 'Gavin', 'Doyle', 'freeway', 'distracted', 'cell', 'phone', 'Doyle', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'getting', 'Gavin', 'exchange', 'insurance', 'information', 'Gavin', 'such', 'hurry', 'instead', 'simply', 'Doyle', 'blank', 'check', 'even', 'are', 'headed', 'same', 'courthouse', 'Gavin', 'offer', 'Doyle', 'ride', 'out', 'Gavin', 'major', 'document', 'court', 'case', 'scene', 'accident', 'where', 'Doyle', 'up', 'Doyle', 'not', 'having', 'ride', 'rushes', 'courthouse', 'too', 'late', 'prevent', 'wife', 'gaining', 'complete', 'custody', 'kids', 'can', 'move', 'state', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'anymore.Gavin', 'save', 'job', 'prevent', 'going', 'prison', 'folder', 'documents', 'Doyle', 'Doyle', 'upset', 'Gavin', 'had', ""n't"", 'run', 'even', 'then', 'Gavin', 'had', 'given', 'ride', 'Doyle', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'loosing', 'kids', 'What', 'results', 'hour', 'half', 'two', 'men', 'vacillating', 'trying', 'kill', 'other', 'then', 'trying', 'help', 'other', 'very', 'long', 'day.My', 'Comments', 'First', 'all', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'atrocious', 'surprising', 'seeing', 'how', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'well', 'mediocre', 'actor', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watch', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'Strike', 'Back', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'typically', 'only', 'good', 'when', 'violent', 'get', 'do', 'occasionally', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'act', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watch', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'So', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'surprising', 'terms', 'acting', 'perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'begin', 'with.The', 'story', 'idea', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'interesting', 'only', 'tried', 'really', 'hurt', 'other', 'person', 'first', 'time', 'five', 'millionth', 'time', 'tried', 'hurt', 'other', 'person', 'movie', 'lost', 'interest', 'completely', 'was', 'continuously', 'staring', 'time', 'counter', 'see', 'how', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'continue', 'just', 'kept', 'going', 'going', 'What', 'worse', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'resolved', 'satisfactory', 'way', 'Gavin', 'still', 'crook', 'what', 'worse', 'bosses', 'who', 'are', 'crooks', 'making', 'doubly', 'crooked', '.Which', 'next', 'point', 'whole', 'subplot', 'Gavin', 'finding', 'out', ""'dirty"", 'lawyer', 'was', 'pretty', '[', 'weak', ']', 'was', 'almost', 'director', 'movie', 'realized', 'main', 'plot', 'was', 'only', 'worth', '50', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'pretty', '[', 'weak', ']', 'subplots', 'fill', 'up', '40', '50', 'minutes.After', 'movie', 'was', 'wife', 'was', 'convinced', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'time', 'time', 'was', 'completely', 'wasted', 'When', 'pressed', 'what', 'thought', 'first', 'comment', 'was', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'behave', 'way', 'response', 'Well', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'normal', 'must', 'admit', 'movie', 'was', 'remarkably', 'far-fetched', 'least', 'perspective', ""'m"", 'not', 'New', 'Yorker', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'New', 'York', 'so', 'perhaps', 'portrayal', 'two', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'vicious', 'almost', 'homicidal', 'maniacs', 'was', 'accurate', 'highly', 'doubt', 'it.Anyway', 'think', 'could', 'possibly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'watched', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'then', 'last', 'ten', 'repeated', 'attacks', 'back', 'forth', 'are', 'tedious', 'pointless', 'tiresome', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'road', 'rage']",N/A
595621,A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F,B00005JL5F,Ahmed,"[1, 2]","Changing lanes is a very interesting flick. It has it all. The movie faces up to traditional concepts of entertainment. a great director. It has good sound effects and a good sense-making atmosphere. It's worth a check if u have nothing to do and is compelling. At certain scenes it can confuse the mind. Still it's a great movie. Unlike the usual Lawyer themed movies and TV shows, this movie is not about a Boston lawyer (it's a lawyer in Manhattan). At various occasions you'll be wondering why the cast made a certain decision that turned out to be the wrong decision. Still in the end you'll think ""Ah well, maybe it wasn't that bad of a decision, made the story more interesting"". It's made up of both irony and coincidences. The story is very gripping indeed and the two main actors were definitely fit for the part. It's a refreshing new adventurous masterpiece that in a way can be described as being thought-provoking. It's also a little something for most John Grisham fans! But not really. Oh and the 5 * was a mistake- I meant to put 4 stars...The movie revolves around Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck), a young partner in a powerful law firm, and Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson), a submissive working class man whose cars have just collided on the expressway. Gavin was busy trying to put together a business meeting on his mobile, and so he presents Doyle with a blank check to cover costs. Doyle, wanting to correctly swap records, rejects, causing Gavin to flee the accident site. In his rush, Gavin leaves behind an essential legal folder that Doyle uses to his advantage, setting off a vile sequence of vengeance between these two men.You shouldn't expect a romantic comedy only because Michell directs it. It's a Lawyer movie. But a so-so one.

For me this movie however, fell a bit flat - I kept expecting something much more than I saw, and the ending seemed as if the Director had run out of ideas, and had to go with the ""off the shelf"" crowd pleaser finale.

595624,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JL5F,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","This film is surprisingly strong despite a few clich&eacute; areas and some overly preachy and sympathetic moments.  The idea behind the film was interesting, and the construction (and marvelous direction) keeps the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the films running length.The film tells the story of two men (one down on his luck reformed alcoholic and one successful attorney working on the deal of his career) who are thrust into each others lives through a car accident.  Gavin, the attorney, is on his way to court when he causes a collision of sorts with Doyle.  Doyle is in a hurry too, rushing to get to a different kind of court, the kind where you fight for custody.  Because of the accident, and Gavin's rudeness, Doyle is late and loses custody to his wife.  What is worse, his wife is leaving town with the kids which means that Doyle will barely see them, if at all.  What he soon realizes is that he has something very important in his possession; a file that Gavin left at the scene of the crime that Doyle can now use as a means to get back at him.But that document is too important for Gavin to just give up.`Changing Lanes' has some genre issues, and it certainly loses a little of it's gruff realism to the clich&eacute;s of the genre (it makes some generic decisions that lead it in directions I wasn't hoping for) but in the end the film really pops visually and emotionally, which is needed in character studies like this one.  It also boasts some nicely crafted performances by two men known for their charm and charisma.  While I don't consider either of them `great actors' (well, Jackson WAS superb in the 90's, but he has lost a lot of steam for me as of late), they both turn in excellent work in this film, especially Affleck who may deliver the performance of his career.  He battles Gavin's internal struggle effortlessly, shifting from corporate villain to frustrated `human' with ease and believability.You hate his actions but you are strangely endeared to him.I thought that the character of Doyle was too much of a clich&eacute; to really rally behind.  It isn't to say that Gavin's character was devoid of clich&eacute;s (but, to be honest, it was really his work plot that was the clich&eacute;) but the script was kinder to him.  Doyle's character just melts down into something very predictable, which I wasn't happy with considering the promise he held.Still, Jackson made the most of it.In the end I'm giving this thrill ride a solid B.  Director Roger Michell REALLY understood how to create a bounty of tension, and he draws from his actors to elevate the issues in the script.  If it had a tighter and less conventional script (yes, the idea has flares of originality, but it is woven rather generically) then this could have been a near flawless film.  Instead, it'll have to settle for underseen and undervalued.Watch it.",4,Stay in your lane...,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,2884,"['film', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'few', 'clich', 'eacute', 'areas', 'overly', 'preachy', 'sympathetic', 'moments', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'construction', 'marvelous', 'direction', 'audience', 'edge', 'seats', 'films', 'running', 'length.The', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'down', 'luck', 'reformed', 'alcoholic', 'one', 'successful', 'attorney', 'working', 'deal', 'career', 'who', 'are', 'thrust', 'others', 'car', 'accident', 'Gavin', 'attorney', 'way', 'court', 'when', 'collision', 'sorts', 'Doyle', 'Doyle', 'hurry', 'too', 'rushing', 'get', 'different', 'kind', 'court', 'kind', 'where', 'fight', 'custody', 'accident', 'Gavin', 'rudeness', 'Doyle', 'late', 'custody', 'wife', 'What', 'worse', 'wife', 'leaving', 'town', 'kids', 'Doyle', 'will', 'barely', 'see', 'What', 'soon', 'something', 'very', 'important', 'possession', 'file', 'Gavin', 'left', 'scene', 'crime', 'Doyle', 'can', 'now', 'use', 'means', 'get', 'back', 'him.But', 'document', 'too', 'important', 'Gavin', 'just', 'give', 'up.', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'genre', 'issues', 'certainly', 'little', 'gruff', 'realism', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'genre', 'generic', 'decisions', 'lead', 'directions', 'was', ""n't"", 'hoping', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'visually', 'emotionally', 'needed', 'character', 'studies', 'one', 'also', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'performances', 'two', 'men', 'known', 'charm', 'charisma', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'great', 'actors', 'well', 'Jackson', 'WAS', 'superb', '90', 'lost', 'lot', 'steam', 'late', 'turn', 'excellent', 'work', 'film', 'especially', 'Affleck', 'who', 'may', 'deliver', 'performance', 'career', 'Gavin', 'internal', 'struggle', 'effortlessly', 'shifting', 'corporate', 'villain', 'frustrated', 'human', 'ease', 'believability.You', 'hate', 'actions', 'are', 'strangely', 'endeared', 'him.I', 'thought', 'character', 'Doyle', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'clich', 'eacute', 'really', 'rally', ""n't"", 'say', 'Gavin', 'character', 'was', 'devoid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'really', 'work', 'plot', 'was', 'clich', 'eacute', 'script', 'was', 'kinder', 'Doyle', 'character', 'just', 'melts', 'down', 'something', 'very', 'predictable', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'considering', 'promise', 'Jackson', 'made', 'most', 'it.In', 'end', ""'m"", 'giving', 'thrill', 'ride', 'solid', 'B', 'Director', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'REALLY', 'understood', 'how', 'create', 'bounty', 'tension', 'actors', 'elevate', 'issues', 'script', 'had', 'tighter', 'less', 'conventional', 'script', 'yes', 'idea', 'flares', 'originality', 'woven', 'rather', 'generically', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'near', 'flawless', 'film', 'Instead', ""'ll"", 'have', 'settle', 'underseen', 'undervalued.Watch']",N/A

I went from `7' to `5', then to `8'; then the rating nosedived to `4' before finally settling on `6'. It's not that I didn't like the movie much but rather overwhelmed with too much happenstances that occurred during the film. In a certain way, the events that unfolded in Changing Lanes seemed to be over-the-top for me. The acting is not that bad at all, and I was at the verge of saying, ""My dear Ben...you cannot act."" before stopping myself, thinking that he was all right yet sleazy and so Ben Affleck-ish. Samuel L. Jackson holds his water. I think Changing Lanes is more of a story-driven film than by performances. Several moments during Changing Lanes seemed to be illogical to me. One particular scene where Gavin Banek pulls the fire alarm, resulting in activation of sprinklers, and goes to the boss' office to pull out a paper from a file cabinet. You know, at that point, the sprinklers are going off, the water is pouring around, and what are the odds that the water will not affect the document that Gavin was reading? Another scene where Gavin's car sees its tire go unhooked seems to be too good to be true. Normally when a car is left ditched, that car shouldn't have remained there for a long period of time. So, when Banek's car crashed, he gets out and walks past by the car. That's another fascinating coincidence. If Roger Michell had focused on two or three twists, Changing Lanes would have been more acceptable, but he decided to push the envelope too far. The ending wasn't all that satisfying for me, and I also got disgusted when Banek came to the school, where the black sons of the father attend, and made up lies about the father. That moment was unsettling and disappointing. Having William Hurt in a cameo appearance was a nice touch. Toni Collette, the lady from Shaft, looks like she is suffering from bone marrow cancer.

Jackson) is an average working class Joe and recovering alcoholic. Both men obviously have nothing in common, but their paths cross when their cars collide on the freeway. Late for work, the self-absorbed yuppie Banek offers Gipson a blank check and hastily abandons the scene of the accident. However, Gipson has stolen one of Banek's legal files containing info which is pertinent to a case he is trying. Luckily for him, the judge gives Banek till day's end to recover the file. Sounds simple? No way, Jose. Because the collision has also had an undesirable effect on Gipson's day as well; as his lateness has cost him a custody battle for his sons. What is the obvious solution to the problem? Good ol' reliable blackmail, of course.Later Banek and Gipson's paths cross again and Banek once more attempts to make amends or the accident, but Gipson is a man with a chip on his shoulder the size of Al Gore's ego and he's not about to make life easy for Banek; who just happens to be married to the boss's daughter.CHANGING LANES is a movie which is never boring, and is helped a lot by Jackson's usual strong performance. Ben Affleck on the other hand, is Ben Affleck. It's amazing how with all the money he's made Ben doesn't seem to possess the initiative to take acting lessons; and it's also a shame that Toni Collette isn't given much to do in her role here as Affleck's secretary.

Ben is a lawyer and he's late for a court hearing, meanwhile Samuel has a court hearing himself relating to important matters concerning his family life.They don't exactly end up in the same courtroom however, since I'm sure you're probably believing that's where it's going. Nope!Well, Ben's character being young and impatient, basically says ""I'm late for work, goodbye!"" after the accident takes place, leaving Samuel's character confused and really angry. Well Ben happens to leave an important file in the possession of Samuel L. Jackson, so Samuel eventually uses that file to get his revenge and make Ben's life a living nightmare after the two of them fail to negotiate in a proper, adult manner.My only gripe with the storyline is that, well for one thing the ending is melodramatic and unmemorable (though to be fair, perhaps the writers were going for something different from the norm, which is a respectable move I suppose).The biggest problem is that the actual nightmare scenarios Samuel puts Ben through isn't NEARLY as intense or as exciting as you're probably hoping for, especially if you've ever watched Samuel's frightening performance in Lakeview Terrace. The same can be said for Ben's revenge against Samuel. Basically the storyline is that Ben and Samuel keep going back and forth at each other trying to one-up the other person in terms of being aggressive and vengeful.But again... the ending.

Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson are random strangers thrown together by random destiny when their cars collide on a New York Freeway. Jackson is on his way to divorce court, while Affleck, a hotshot lawyer from a giant Manhattan firm, is late for a courtdate of his own. A careless Affleck decides to leave the scene without giving much personal information, not even offering Jackson a lift to the courthouse, and eventually realizes that he has left an important and completely necessary document behind him. Jackson, seeing the file as a trump card, holds on to it until he can exact proper revenge for what he loses as a result of Affleck's callousness. It's not a one-sided affair, though, and soon we see the two of them playing out various schemes to get each other back for what they keep doing to each other. It's probably the worst day that either of them has encountered, but as the film continues we begin to question if they're destroyed by it, or maybe are being given the chance to wipe the board clean and make their lives better. It doesn't achieve every single one of its aims to be a marked cut above conventional drama, but it certainly does a great, entertaining job, never compromising its focus on character development for brainless action or ever pandering to simpleminded morality. Affleck hasn't been better in years as a golden boy who loses his innocence by truly getting a look around at the world around him, and Jackson is a shocking contrast to his powerfully cool Shaft as this character, a broken man who has just taken too many beatings from his difficult life. Smaller roles are also first-rate, including a stunning Toni Collette as Affleck's colleague and Amanda Peet (surprisingly good, I'd hate to admit) as his soulless wife.",4,Surprisingly effective,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1929,"['Compelling', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'most', 'damaging', 'cliches', 'one', 'up', 'mass-marketed', 'studio', 'fare', 'truly', 'grit', 'story', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'are', 'random', 'strangers', 'together', 'random', 'destiny', 'when', 'cars', 'collide', 'New', 'York', 'Freeway', 'Jackson', 'way', 'divorce', 'court', 'Affleck', 'hotshot', 'lawyer', 'giant', 'Manhattan', 'firm', 'late', 'courtdate', 'own', 'careless', 'Affleck', 'leave', 'scene', 'giving', 'much', 'personal', 'information', 'not', 'even', 'offering', 'Jackson', 'lift', 'courthouse', 'eventually', 'left', 'important', 'completely', 'necessary', 'document', 'Jackson', 'seeing', 'file', 'trump', 'card', 'can', 'exact', 'proper', 'revenge', 'what', 'result', 'Affleck', 'callousness', 'not', 'one-sided', 'affair', 'soon', 'see', 'two', 'playing', 'out', 'various', 'schemes', 'get', 'other', 'back', 'what', 'keep', 'doing', 'other', 'probably', 'worst', 'day', 'encountered', 'film', 'begin', 'question', ""'re"", 'destroyed', 'maybe', 'are', 'being', 'given', 'chance', 'wipe', 'board', 'clean', 'make', 'lives', 'better', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'single', 'one', 'aims', 'be', 'marked', 'cut', 'conventional', 'drama', 'certainly', 'great', 'entertaining', 'job', 'never', 'compromising', 'focus', 'character', 'development', 'brainless', 'action', 'ever', 'pandering', 'simpleminded', 'morality', 'Affleck', ""n't"", 'been', 'better', 'years', 'golden', 'boy', 'who', 'innocence', 'truly', 'getting', 'look', 'around', 'world', 'Jackson', 'shocking', 'contrast', 'powerfully', 'cool', 'Shaft', 'character', 'broken', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'taken', 'too', 'many', 'beatings', 'difficult', 'life', 'Smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'also', 'first-rate', 'including', 'stunning', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Affleck', 'colleague', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'surprisingly', 'good', ""'d"", 'hate', 'admit', 'soulless', 'wife']",N/A

What I mean is that it lets you think that it's a tale of the vengeance that two men inflict on one another after a traffic accident causes more trouble than they could have imagined, but really it's much more than that. It's about self-preservation, and how much a man is willing to do to protect himself, even if it means hurting someone else.The two men are Gavin Baneck (Ben Affleck) and Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson). Gavin, a Wall Street lawyer, is on his way to a court hearing to prove that he acted on behalf of a client and not out of self-interest, which would put him in jail - and he's got the paperwork to prove it. Doyle is also on his way to a hearing to prove that he should retain joint custody of his two young children, because he's a recovering alcoholic and is about to buy a home for all of them to live in.When they get into the accident, Gavin leaves Doyle stranded, saying, ""Better luck next time,"" but he also leaves behind a file that is crucial to his hearing. By the time Doyle makes it to his appointment, it's already over and sole custody has been rewarded to his ex-wife. Gavin, not wanting to be the one who screws over himself and his partners, does everything in his power to get back that file from Doyle, which includes bankrupting him. He doesn't want to hurt him, but if he doesn't get that file to the courthouse by the end of the day, he's probably going to jail for a long time. However, Doyle, acting irrationally because he's scared of losing his kids, is unwilling to cooperate, and things quickly escalate, leaving both men wounded and questioning themselves.What makes this film work so well is that while the premise may not be probable, it is entirely plausible.

In movies, everybody likes to see good guys defeating bad guys, but the real world doesn't work like that; it's just a bunch of flawed humans trying to figure out the point of it all and trying to become the good guy.

One is on his way up, and one is on his way out of the gutter, for lack of a better term.  Affleck, in a role seemed tailored for him, plays the young attorney on his way to power.

He does manage to guide his characters zig zag-ing perceptions of right and wrong with the skill you would expect.Jackson handles his part with much more of what you've come to expect.  He expertly handles his character's seeming disregard for all he has rebuilt in reaction to the sheer frustration and absurdity of his situation.

595637,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005JL5F,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[5, 11]","`One Wrong Turn Deserves Another"", that's the tagline for the film Changing Lanes (2002), starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson, directed by Roger Michell, someone I've never heard of before here, but I found out he also directed the Julia Roberts film Notting Hill (1999), which I have yet to see, mostly because Julia Roberts kinda scares me with those big horse teeth of hers.As the film begins, we sort of meet two individuals, a fancy schmanzy lawyer named Gavin Banek (Affleck) and a telephone insurance salesman Doyle Gipson (Jackson).  The two men, while both on their way to court, Banek involved in a case worth a lot of money to the law firm he's a partner in, and Gipson involved in a custody hearing with his divorced wife, get into a car accident with each other.  Gipson wants to handle the situation in the correct manner, but Banek, who caused the accident, has little time to deal with the formalities, tries to deal with the matter expeditiously, pawning off a blank check on Gipson, leaving not only the scene of the accident, but leaving Gipson stranded as his car is totaled.  In his haste, Banek accidentally leaves an important document with Gipson, one that could potentially cost his firm over 100 million dollars and even prison time for Banek.  As a result of the accident and being stranded by Banek, Gipson misses his appearance, and the court rules against him, allowing for his ex-wife to move away with their two sons.  Banek, in the meantime, is allowed until the end of the day to produce the lost document, and later discovers Gipson still has possession of it, but is disgruntled over the treatment he received from Banek and losing his custody hearing, setting up a cycle of revenge between the two men, each sort of `one upping' each other to increasingly dangerous and life-altering levels.First of all, I just had a hard time buying Affleck as a partner in a big law firm, despite the fact that his father-in-law, played wonderfully by Sidney Pollack, is also a partner.  I think he's a decent actor, a bit over-rated, and he's certainly got the smarmy quality down, inherent in many of his roles, but I didn't feel like he had the level of intelligence required to hold the position he does...and are all lawyers smarmy, greedy, opportunistic liars looking to rip people off?  Maybe...I don't know, but this movie would have you believe so...Jackson is pretty good, but he's pretty much playing a role I've seen numerous times before from him, the angry, loud black man who yells a lot.  It's toned down a little here, but not much.  In the film, we find his wife left him because of his problem with alcohol and his addiction to rage.  Throughout the film, she would seem on the verge of possibly reconciling with him, but then would quickly change her mind.  This happened three or fours times, and given the film takes place over the course of one day, I could see where Jackson's character might react the way he does, given that she has such a penchant for flip flopping.  One of the things I disliked about this film was each time one of the main characters would initiate some form of revenge on the other, they would suffer from moralistic pangs, which would soon pass as the cycle continued.  And honestly, there weren't really any likeable characters in this film, despite any attempts of redemption by the characters within the story.  Banek is a self-serving lawyer, one whose professional dealings seem awful shady (he struggles with this throughout most of the movie, as we are supposed to believe his conscious is now bothering him, despite his previous actions).  Oh yeah, he's also an adulterer...and Jackson's character, a recovering alcoholic telephone insurance salesman with confrontation issues, one who his AA sponsor (played by William Hurt) say is `addicted to chaos'.  We do see him desperately trying to put the pieces of his life back together and develop a relationship with his two young sons, but I always got the feeling like his attempts were always too little, too late.  I did like the performances by Pollack and Hurt, even though they got so little screen time and it seemed like their characters were a bit contrived as plot devices, both seemingly only present to serve as external forces for good, with Hurt and Jackson, and bad, with Pollack and Affleck, to put it simply.  Toni Collette makes an appearance or two, as a colleague of Affleck at his law firm, but her character is almost a non-character, offering little more than a foil for Banek to bounce off of as he deals with his conscience.  And I have to say, while I think she's normally an attractive woman, she did not look good here, with here bleached out hair.  I was expecting a much different direction at the end, as the film reminded me slightly of the 1993 Michael Douglas film Falling Down, in that events continuously build on each other leading to an inevitable conclusion, but here, things wrapped up just a bit too convenient for my tastes, especially given the self destructive nature of the characters and events that transpired.The wide screen anamorphic picture here looks wonderful, and there are a few special features available including a really worthwhile commentary track by the director, a 15 minute `Making of' featurette, deleted and extended scenes (only about three total and not really offering much more to the story), a five minute `A Writer's Perspective' featurette, and a theatrical trailer for the film.  The product page here mentions alternative endings, but I didn't see those listed in the special features of the disc.  By the way, if you ever get into a one upping contest with Samuel L. Jackson, check your car's lug nuts regularly.Cookieman108",3,&quot;You're addicted to chaos.&quot;,1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,5734,"['One', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'tagline', 'film', 'Changing', 'Lanes',

Directed by Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"", ""Persuasion"", etc.) and a screenplay/story by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin (""The Player"", ""The Rapture"", ""Deep Impact"", etc.), the film which stars Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson was a financial success and grossed over $94 million worldwide.""CHANGING LANES"" is a compelling story of two men who had normal lives and then because of this accident, their lives are changed forever.  Now driven by anger and revenge, the film is a thriller that will surprise the viewer on how far these men will go to destroy the other.VIDEO & AUDIO:""CHANGING LANES"" receives its High Definition treatment with a 1080p transfer (with an aspect ration of 2:35:1).  The Blu-ray release is quite solid as we see the details in the men's skin (many close up shots).  The picture quality does show some presence of grain and also dust speckles but nothing that deters you from watching.  The film utilizes a bluish hue during outdoor scenes and amber during indoor scenes.  In fact, it seems to have been shot during overcast, so it's not a film where you would see any color vibrancy.  There is a slight softness to the picture quality but found no artifacting.  Overall, compared to the original DVD, this transfer of ""CHANGING LANES"" looks very good.As for audio, ""CHANGING LANES"" sports and English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track (and also Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily a dialogue driven film but there are scenes that utilize natural ambiance during crowd scenes and sounds that get really cool use of audio during the sprinkler scene and even the car accident scene.If anything, the film is primarily front channel driven with not much utilization of low frequency bass from the subwoofer or the rear surrounds.  The good news is that the audio is clear and understandable, the disappointing news is that the soundtrack does not take advantage of all speaker channels for the action scene.  So, you get an average soundtrack at best.Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""CHANGING LANES"" features the following special features in standard definition with the exception of the theatrical trailer which is in HD:* Audio Commentary by director Roger Michell - An interesting insight of the film from Director Roger Michell.  Commentary seemed slow at times but there were a good amount of behind-the-scene tidbits on working with the various talent, deviations from the original screenplay but most of all, how they wanted to handle the scenes that featured the World Trade Center as he felt despite shooting the footage in Jan. 2001, having removed it post 9/11 but then deciding to keep the Twin Towers in the final cut.  Michell is very complimentary to his cast and crew but showing how people working on the film did a wonderful job when it came to cinematography and even production design.* The Making of Changing Lanes - A 15 minute featurette that is a making-of, with interviews with the cast and crew about the making of ""CHANGING LANES"".  And quite interesting that you have the movie man doing voice overs at the beginning and end.* A Writer's Perspective - A six minute featurette on the overall screenplay with interviews with screenplay writers Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin who both seem to enjoy the lunch between Gavin and his wife.* Deleted Scenes - A total of two deleted scenes.  One featuring Gavin with a student Gordon Pinella who needed to be interviewed for a job and another with Doyle meeting with his boss in regards to his performance at work.  Two scenes that deserved to be cut from the film.* Extended Scene - Featuring a single extended scene when Gavin was at the church and in the confession booth as he puts the blame on Doyle for what is happening with his life.  In the film, we know how Gavin's state of mind, so I'm glad they shortened it in the film and not let it run this long.* Original Theatrical Trailer - The original theatrical trailer in HD.JUDGMENT CALL:""CHANGING LANES"" was a film that definitely had an interesting premise.  What if these two men who feel their lives were wrecked because of their one incident, tried to one up each other and nearly destroy themselves in the process.People who let their anger and their hatred get the best of them and while its nearly too late, just enough time to see how they let it go too far.What Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin are able to come up with for the screenplay is to manipulate the audience into rooting for a certain side and then you just realize that these two men are just too flawed and are way over their heads.If anything, it's the ""what if"" that becomes an entertaining experiment of exposing the human element of revenge.  We hear and read about vindictive people getting back to each other, ""CHANGING LANES"" shows people of that unthinkable moral potential if one is able to go too far.Samuel Jackson does a wonderful job of playing the character of Doyle Gipson but most of all, a man that has his own demons to contend with and in one scene, is told that he enjoys living in chaos.  If anything, the interaction with Jackson's Gipson and Affleck's Gavin Banek made Affleck's performance much more believable.  Sydney Pollack, Kim Staunton and Toni Collette also do well onscreen despite their short duration onscreen.Overall, ""CHANGING LANES"" is one of those clever films that is enjoyable but as for owning it on Blu-ray, its left to the viewer's choice if its a film worthy of repeated viewings.",4,"Blu-ray: A riveting and provocative thriller but if you own the DVD, is it worth the double

595645,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JL5F,D. Litton,"[1, 2]","""Changing Lanes"" is everything that its trailer is not, and that's a good thing. Movie previews for this refreshingly different thriller tout it as a fast-paced revenge machine, but in actuality, it moves at a much slower speed, developing its story and characters in a manner that brings us into their lives rather than placing us on the sidelines. The ending is a bit meak, but the suspense is non-stop, the acting superb, and the overall effect a satisfying one.The beginning keeps details at bay, introducing fragments of the puzzle that will later come together. Ben Affleck plays Gavin Banek, a successful young attorney who has been sent by his firm to deliver important files concerning A) a charitable institution, and B) a very disgruntled granddaughter of its now-deceased founder. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we meet Samuel L. Jackson's middle-class father, Doyle Gibson, who is in the process of taking out a loan for a home in the hopes that his ex-wife will accept the action as a peace offering instead of taking their two children to Oregon.The two men are both on their way to the courthouse. They have an accident after Banek attempts to change lanes, causing Gibson to careen into a freeway divider. Gibson wants to exchange insurance information (""I wanna do things the right way""); Banek, in a frenzied rush, gives him a blank check and speeds off, unaware that in his search for his checkbook, an important file landed on the street. Gibson retrieves the file, thumbs a ride to the courthouse, too late to make his statement in the custody case; Banek, who discovers his file is missing, is given an end-of-the-day deadline to come up with the document.This all occurs within the first twenty minutes of the film, but not to worry: there's more to it than what we've seen, or what we think will happen. Much of what goes on centers around the important document, that which delegates the power to make decisions for the institution to the law firm. Banek lies to his two partners, telling them the case was ruled in their favor to tide them over while he attempts to get the file back from Gibson.This is where the good gets even better, as the two men engage in a battle of wills and wits. It's like a game, really, an ongoing silent war in which a double-cross is payed back within the hour. Banek enlists the help of a hacker known for his ability to ""help out with things that need helping out."" He infiltrates Gibson's bank accounts, bankrupting him of his precious loan (""I need this loan for my life,"" Gibson later pleads with the teller), setting in motion a chain reaction of events that lead to an uncertain destination.I must say, the film packs a real whallop in its first and second acts. The somewhat slow pacing is in its favor, allowing us to understand the characters while at the same time putting real effort into the explanations of various plot twists and new developments. There is an underlying web of deception underneath the action that centers around the document, the law firm, and the institution, that which I will not reveal. This subplot turns out to be the basis for the thrills, and it is smart and cooly calculated without insulting one's intelligence.Also backing the film is its terrific cast, featuring two leads who play off one other so well, they could carry the movie by themselves. Jackson is a man of many virtues, and he displays a versatility here that is mesmerizing and intense. We feel for this man as a father, and as a person, and can come to understand his reasoning. Affleck has found a role befitting of his acting ability; there is a diversity of emotions to Banek's character, much of which revolves around being held at the whim of a man he hardly knows, and Affleck portrays this exquisitely.The film worked for me right up until the ending, a well-intentioned morality lesson that doesn't quite live up to the goals the material sets for itself. But to think about it further is to realize that there is really no other way for ""Changing Lanes"" to end without descending into the ludicrousness that plagues most thrillers; the ending we are supplied with is safe while not being totally satisfactory. Up until this point, there are thrills, surprises, and acting gusto aplenty, making the experience an enjoyable and involving one.",4,Smart and cooly calculated.,1019174400,"04 19, 2002",2002,4321,"['Changing', 'Lanes', 'everything', 'trailer', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'Movie', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'thriller', 'tout', 'fast-paced', 'revenge', 'machine', 'actuality', 'much', 'slower', 'speed', 'developing', 'story', 'characters', 'manner', 'lives', 'rather', 'placing', 'sidelines', 'ending', 'bit', 'meak', 'suspense', 'non-stop', 'acting', 'superb', 'overall', 'effect', 'satisfying', 'one.The', 'beginning', 'keeps', 'details', 'bay', 'introducing', 'fragments', 'puzzle', 'will', 'later', 'come', 'together', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Gavin', 'Banek', 'successful', 'young', 'attorney', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'firm', 'deliver', 'important', 'files', 'concerning', 'A', 'charitable', 'institution', 'B', 'very', 'disgruntled', 'granddaughter', 'now-deceased', 'founder', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', 'meet', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'middle-class', 'father', 'Doyle', 'Gibson', 'who', 'process', 'taking', 'out', 'loan', 'home', 'hopes', 'ex-wife', 'will', 'accept', 'action', 'peace', 'offering', 'instead', 'taking', 'two', 'children', 'Oregon.The', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'way', 'courthouse', 'have', 'accident', 'Banek', 'attempts', 'change', 'lanes', 'causing', 'Gibson', 'careen', 'freeway', 'divider', 'Gibson', 'exchange', 'insurance', 'information', 'wan', 'na', 'do', 'things', 'right', 'way', 'Banek', 'frenzied', 'rush', 'blank', 'check', 'speeds', 'off', 'unaware', 'search', 'checkbook', 'important', 'file', 'landed', 'street', 'Gibson', 'file', 'thumbs', 'ride', 'courthouse', 'too', 'late', 'make', 'statement', 'custody', 'case', 'Banek', 'who', 'file', 'missing', 'given', 'end-of-the-day', 'deadline', 'come', 'up', 'document.This', 'occurs', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'not', 'worry', 'more', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'what', 'think', 'will', 'happen', 'Much', 'what', 'centers', 'important', 'document', 'power', 'make', 'decisions', 'institution', 'law', 'firm', 'Banek', 'two', 'partners', 'telling', 'case', 'was', 'ruled', 'favor', 'tide', 'over', 'get', 'file', 'back', 'Gibson.This', 'where', 'good', 'even', 'better', 'two', 'men', 'engage', 'battle', 'wills', 'wits', 'game', 'really', 'ongoing', 'silent', 'war', 'double-cross', 'payed', 'back', 'hour', 'Banek', 'help', 'hacker', 'known', 'ability', 'help', 'out', 'things', 'need', 'helping', 'out', 'Gibson', 'bank', 'accounts', 'bankrupting', 'precious', 'loan', 'need', 'loan', 'life', 'Gibson', 'later', 'teller', 'setting', 'motion', 'chain', 'reaction', 'events', 'lead', 'uncertain', 'destination.I', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'real', 'whallop', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'pacing', 'favor', 'allowing', 'understand', 'characters', 'same', 'time', 'putting', 'real', 'effort', 'explanations', 'various', 'plot', 'twists', 'new', 'developments', 'underlying', 'web', 'deception', 'action', 'centers', 'document', 'law', 'firm', 'institution', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'subplot', 'out', 'be', 'basis', 'thrills', 'smart', 'cooly', 'calculated', 'insulting', 'one', 'intelligence.Also', 'backing', 'film', 'terrific', 'cast', 'featuring', 'two', 'leads', 'who', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'other', 'so', 'well', 'could', 'carry', 'movie', 'Jackson', 'man', 'many', 'virtues', 'versatility', 'here', 'mesmerizing', 'intense', 'feel', 'man', 'father', 'person', 'can', 'come', 'understand', 'reasoning', 'Affleck', 'found', 'role', 'befitting', 'acting', 'ability', 'diversity', 'emotions', 'Banek', 'character', 'much', 'being', 'held', 'whim', 'man', 'hardly', 'Affleck', 'exquisitely.The', 'film', 'worked', 'right', 'up', 'ending', 'well-intentioned', 'morality', 'lesson', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'goals', 'material', 'sets', 'think', 'further', 'realize', 'really', 'other', 'way', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'end', 'descending', 'ludicrousness', 'most', 'thrillers', 'ending', 'are', 'supplied', 'safe', 'not', 'being', 'totally', 'satisfactory', 'Up', 'point', 'are', 'thrills', 'surprises', 'acting', 'gusto', 'aplenty', 'making', 'experience', 'enjoyable', 'involving', 'one']",N/A

You have an important event coming up in the day, then something totally unexpected happens to throw you off your game and disorient you, then the next thing you know you're spending the rest of your time fighting uphill.  So I lended a sympathetic eye to the intriguing film CHANGING LANES, when a young attorney (Ben Affleck) on his way to court to file a questionable document at best has a fender bender with an insurance salesman (Samuel L. Jackson) on his way to court to salvage his family and his life.  Once Affleck leaves the scene (and his highly prized document) everything starts to unravel, pitting the two men against each other in ever-increasing altercations of rancor and anger.  Yet as both men find their respective situations spinning out of control, both also learn some very basic things--about themselves.Affleck and Jackson are superb; they're totally and utterly believable as honorable men who find it all too easy to cross the civility line and allow darker thoughts to prevail.  Yet they both show their characters as men with consciences; this dichotomy is riveting to watch.  Compound this with the fact Jackson's character is a recovering alcoholic and the tension becomes even more compelling.  Other noteworthy performances include William Hurt as Jackson's sponsor and the ever-great Sydney Pollack as Affleck's unscrupulous father-in-law and senior law partner.  This is exceptional drama, although at times Jackson is a tad over the top (but name me a performance where he isn't).  CHANGING LANES is like having a whole month of Bad Mondays.--D.

595650,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JL5F,Eric,"[15, 18]","Changing Lanes happens to feature two movie stars in the lead roles and is funded by Paramount Pictures, one of the top film production studios. So is it with anything less than pure surprise that this doesn't turn out to be an action or buddy picture? Not only does this film happen to be a character-driven thriller, it's also an intriguing look at societal pressures on the human individual, delivering in a manner that is intense, edgy, and perhaps even quite frightening.Ben Affleck stars as Gavin Banek and Samuel L. Jackson is Doyle Gipson. Banek is a high-priced lawyer who is ready to finalize a big deal with will turn over a recently deceased millionaire's entire fortune to his firm. Gipson is a recovering alcoholic who's doing everything he can (mainly by purchasing a house in Queens for them to settle in) to save his marriage and keep his wife from taking the children and moving to another state. Both Banek and Gipson are on their way to court when their cars crash into each other.Gipson wants to get everything done legally, ""the right way,"" but Banek is in too much of a hurry, so he simply leaves a blank check and takes off to court, leaving the other man stranded. However, Banek leaves the most important file at the scene of the accident (which Gipson is now in possession of), and Gipson misses his own court hearing, losing any chance for custody of his kids to his wife. Banek's determination to get the file back and Gipson's anger and frustration turns this cross of paths into a game of cat-and-mouse and revenge which makes for probably the most lopsided day of their lives.Changing Lanes is a film that surprised me almost every minute of the way. There's a lot of plot and theme at work here, but I want to emphasize that this is hardly pretentious filmmaking; it's an honest look at just how far pressure can push normal men, as well as how such pressure can bring out the best qualities in these same people. After a rather clumsy introduction and a chaotically directed crash scene that felt rather rushed, the film settled in comfortably into its main story. On the surface, the movie plays perfectly well as a thriller, certainly enough to satisfy thriller buffs looking for hard-edged suspense.But further yet, the film becomes a character study of two men who lead opposite lives, but perhaps aren't as dissimilar as each may think. Rich and affluent, Affleck's Banek is a man on the top, but despite his seemingly arrogant and impatient behavior, he displays a moral and conflicted center, torn by what's right and what everyone else-namely his boss, co-workers, wife-says is right. Undoubtedly the most complex character Affleck has ever played, this is also the young actor's best performance to date.Samuel L. Jackson is easily one of the best actors around, and his portrayal here is absolutely terrific, perhaps his most substantial performance since his role in Pulp Fiction. Gipson is certainly less priveleged than Banek, and this societal gap displays an interesting effect once things get out of hand. Gipson represents the majority of us, the working middle class that's frustrated when fate hands him a wrong turn.  The disastrous day that Gipson endures is affecting, and it's both simultaneously crushing and exhilarating to see a reasonable man go to the extremes.There are far more themes at work here, and I've only touched on the surface.  For instance, there's a powerful scene where Amanda Peet (as Banek's wife) delivers a coldly manipulative speech that clues us in as to why Banek would cheat on his beautiful wife with a less physically attractive, but far kinder, more emotionally supportive woman (played well by Toni Collete).  Another similarly powerhouse sequence is Sydney Pollack's (playing Banek's boss) diatribe on ethics in business and why the cutthroat method is the only effective tool for pressing business matters.  With an abundance of moments like these, there's so much theme at work in the script that the film simply demands repeat viewings.Changing Lanes is always entertaining, thanks to Roger Mitchell's well-paced and sure-handed direction, and the script never falters when it comes to both story and thematic material, mixing both together without ever coming off as preachy. The film has lots to offer, and for viewers willing to take the ride, the rewards are plentiful. It's been a fine year for movies so far, and without a doubt, Changing Lanes is one of the best cinematic offerings to date.",5,A superb thriller and character study.,1031616000,"09 10, 2002",2002,4491,"['Changing', 'Lanes', 'feature', 'two', 'movie', 'stars', 'lead', 'roles', 'funded', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'one', 'top', 'film', 'production', 'studios', 'So', 'anything', 'less', 'pure', 'surprise', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'action', 'buddy', 'picture', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'happen', 'be', 'character-driven', 'thriller', 'also', 'intriguing', 'look', 'societal', 'pressures', 'human', 'individual', 'delivering', 'manner', 'intense', 'edgy', 'perhaps', 'even', 'quite', 'frightening.Ben', 'Affleck', 'stars', 'Gavin', 'Banek', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Doyle', 'Gipson', 'Banek', 'high-priced', 'lawyer', 'who', 'ready', 'finalize', 'big', 'deal', 'will', 'turn', 'over', 'recently', 'deceased', 'millionaire', 'entire', 'fortune', 'firm', 'Gipson', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'mainly', 'purchasing', 'house', 'Queens', 'settle', 'save', 'marriage', 'keep', 'wife', 'taking', 'children', 'moving', 'state', 'Banek', 'Gipson', 'are', 'way', 'court', 'when', 'cars', 'crash', 'other.Gipson', 'get', 'everything', 'done', 'legally', 'right', 'way', 'Banek', 'too', 'much', 'hurry', 'simply', 'blank', 'check', 'court', 'leaving', 'other', 'man', 'stranded', 'However', 'Banek', 'most', 'important', 'file', 'scene', 'accident', 'Gipson', 'now', 'possession', 'Gipson', 'own', 'court', 'hearing', 'losing', 'chance', 'custody', 'kids', 'wife', 'Banek', 'determination', 'get', 'file', 'back', 'Gipson', 'anger', 'frustration', 'cross', 'paths', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'revenge', 'probably', 'most', 'lopsided', 'day', 'lives.Changing', 'Lanes', 'film', 'surprised', 'almost', 'minute', 'way', 'lot', 'plot', 'theme', 'work', 'here', 'want', 'emphasize', 'hardly', 'pretentious', 'filmmaking', 'honest', 'look', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'pressure', 'can', 'push', 'normal', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'such', 'pressure', 'can', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'qualities', 'same', 'people', 'rather', 'clumsy', 'introduction', 'chaotically', 'directed', 'crash', 'scene', 'felt', 'rather', 'rushed', 'film', 'settled', 'comfortably', 'main', 'story', 'surface', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'well', 'thriller', 'certainly', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'thriller', 'buffs', 'looking', 'hard-edged', 'suspense.But', 'further', 'yet', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'lead', 'opposite', 'lives', 'perhaps', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'dissimilar', 'may', 'think', 'Rich', 'affluent', 'Affleck', 'Banek', 'man', 'top', 'seemingly', 'arrogant', 'impatient', 'behavior', 'moral', 'conflicted', 'center', 'torn', 'what', 'right', 'what', 'everyone', 'else-namely', 'boss', 'co-workers', 'wife-says', 'right', 'Undoubtedly', 'most', 'complex', 'character', 'Affleck', 'ever', 'played', 'also', 'young', 'actor', 'best', 'performance', 'date.Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'portrayal', 'here', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'perhaps', 'most', 'substantial', 'performance', 'role', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Gipson', 'certainly', 'less', 'priveleged', 'Banek', 'societal', 'gap', 'displays', 'interesting', 'effect', 'once', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'Gipson', 'majority', 'working', 'middle', 'class', 'frustrated', 'when', 'fate', 'hands', 'wrong', 'turn', 'disastrous', 'day', 'Gipson', 'affecting', 'simultaneously', 'crushing', 'exhilarating', 'see', 'reasonable', 'man', 'go', 'extremes.There', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'themes', 'work', 'here', ""'ve"", 'only', 'touched', 'surface', 'instance', 'powerful', 'scene', 'where', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Banek', 'wife', 'coldly', 'manipulative', 'speech', 'why', 'Banek', 'would', 'cheat', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'less', 'physically', 'attractive', 'far', 'kinder', 'more', 'emotionally', 'supportive', 'woman', 'played', 'well', 'Toni', 'Collete', 'similarly', 'powerhouse', 'sequence', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'playing', 'Banek', 'boss', 'diatribe', 'ethics', 'business', 'why', 'cutthroat', 'method', 'only', 'effective', 'tool', 'pressing', 'business', 'matters', 'abundance', 'moments', 'so', 'much', 'theme', 'work', 'script', 'film', 'simply', 'repeat', 'viewings.Changing', 'Lanes', 'always', 'entertaining', 'thanks', 'Roger', 'Mitchell', 'well-paced', 'sure-handed', 'direction', 'script', 'never', 'when', 'story', 'thematic', 'material', 'mixing', 'together', 'ever', 'coming', 'off', 'preachy', 'film', 'lots', 'offer', 'viewers', 'willing', 'take', 'ride', 'rewards', 'are', 'plentiful', 'been', 'fine', 'year', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'doubt', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'one', 'best', 'cinematic', 'offerings', 'date']",N/A

I cannot begin to count the number of totally implausible situations that are conjured here.Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) has got to be one of the stupidest characters ever written.  This is supposed to be a bright young lawyer whose ambition has gotten the better of his principles.  Instead he comes across as a hapless loser.When one understands that lawyers can lose their license to practice law for committing felonies even if they don't go to jail, and also knowing that Gavin's entire existence depends on his being a lawyer, almost everything he does is utterly illogical.  He leaves the scene of the accident with Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) when he could easily have called the court to advise them that he had been in a wreck.  Contrary to how it was portrayed, that hearing could have been rescheduled.  The judge probably would have required some proof of the accident, but that's about it.  Yet he drives off knowing he could go to jail and lose his law license for this.  Nonsense.It gets worse.  He decides to alter financial records, (a felony), so he can blackmail Gipson (a felony) and he LEAVES HIS NAME ON GIPSON'S VOICEMAIL TO TELL HIM THIS?!  As if Gipson would tell no-one and the FBI wouldn't be at his office in 15 minutes to lock him up.That's just the warm-up.  In the course of the next hour, the two of them commit about a dozen felonies between them, and then inexplicably do a 180 degree turn and become the Justice League of America.  I guess this is supposed to erase all the mayhem they caused during the first 90 minutes of the film and make us feel like they are great guys for realizing the errors of their ways.Samuel Jackson gives another excellent performance rendering the only character that is remotely believable other than Sydney Pollack who is credible as the crooked law partner pulling all the strings.Ben Affleck is awful, but to be fair his character is so moronic that it would be hard for anyone to play this part and not look foolish.  Affleck's biggest mistake was agreeing to take this part in the first place.  Toni Collette and Amanda Peet both come across as gutless whiners.This film is an insult to the audiences' intelligence, not to mention to lawyers in general.  This is not to say that there aren't crooked lawyers, but they are lawyers for heaven's sake; they know the law.  When they break it, they usually do it deviously, not like common street thugs.Other than Jackson's performance, there is not much to recommend this film.  I rated it a 3/10.

Neither one understands for a minute just how important the moment in time when they meet is for the other. The rich guy blows off the poor guy because the rich guy's time and schedule has to be far more important than whatever the poor guy has going on. The poor guy picks up a file folder inadvertently dropped in the street by the rich guy and thereby gains leverage for the following events. How far will each one go to get what he wants and needs forms the basis for the rest of the film. It could have been so good. Instead, it was soooooo bad.The trailer for this movie promised me suspense, excitement, thrills and chills. I saw this film in its first day of release. I'm still waiting for all the reactions I was promised to sink in. The point is that the trailer was far, far better than the movie it represents. The trailer is also extremely misleading.Ben Aflick tries very hard to be the hardcase lawyer type, but I got the impression from the beginning that Ben just didn't have it in him. He can do arrogant; he just can't pull off heartless and cold-blooded when he keeps showing up with that one lonely tear working its way down his perfect face. It's not the ""Men Don't Cry"" syndrome so much as it just is so out of character to see him as doing whatever it will take to get his file back while he has these simultaneous attacks of conscience and that one lonely tear.Samuel L. Jackson is one of my favorite actors. I believed, before I saw Changing Lanes that Samuel L. could play anyone or anything. I was wrong. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to emasculate Samuel for this movie should be fired from movie making forever. Samuel's character has every reason to feel outrage - at his sorry life, at Ben Aflick's mania for the file Jackson accidently has in his possession, at his wishy-washy wife, even at the world at large. There are sparks of Samuel's outrage here and there, but they come at odd times and without much credibility.

He is married to the daughter of the boss who is a crook and stealing money from some foundation. Circumstances put him in a road accident when he is on his way to the court with a man who is an Alcoholic Anonymous, divorced, in a lawsuit with his ex-wife about the custody of the kids and is on the way to the same court. The lawyer drops a file that is essential for his case and he strands the other man on the highway on foot. Both are late in court. The lawyer manages his way out under a strict deadline condition. The other one loses his case. And then everything goes down because each one will try to pressurize the other into repairing the damage and they will cause even more damage by doing so. The film then is a thriller in a way since we expect any moment more violence and more retribution and more vengeance. Dependence is the worst thing that can hit a man, be it tobacco, alcohol, drugs or plain catastrophe or anti-social reactions. Lawyers are all crooked and perverted and sick in their minds and you can decide to do more good everyday than you do evil, if you are a lawyer you can be sure you will never keep that word. So you better give five dollars to the beggar round the corner in the street: that will probably be the only good action you will do today. Good action? My foot!

And if you are a mischief maker, a catastrophe bringer, a crash perpetrator, you better stop drinking, stop smoking, stop getting under the influence of anything and retire into some kind of padded monastery or reclusion center for the mentally insane because there is no way you will change and the world will change.

If you are looking for a fast-moving, energetic movie, do not watch this movie.The premise of Changing Lanes is intriguing -- two men with very different lives collide on the freeway in NY, and their lives become affected and intermingled in a most unusual way from that point forward.  A single moment makes a significant difference in both men's lives.  And the entire movie takes place in the course of a single day.  As I mentioned, it is definitely not fast-moving.A little more about the plot ... Jackson plays a down-on-his-luck guy who works as a customer service agent in an insurance call center.  He is a father of two who, on this fateful morning, is stuck in traffic en route to a very important child custody hearing.  He is also a recovering alcoholic.  Affleck plays a wealthy law firm partner, who happens to be married to another partner's daughter.  Scruples are few and far between in the law firm, and Affleck is quickly falling prey to believing wrong is actually right.  You can tell early on that his heart is in the right place and he maintains a sense of decency despite his high-powered, cut-throat career.  On this fateful morning, he is en route to a court room as well, where he must deliver a very important document that signs over millions of dollars of a deceased man's estate, against the wishes of his heir.  In a moment, these men ""change lanes"" on the freeway and collide.  Jackson winds up in the median with his car banged up enough to be undriveable.  Affleck stops just long enough to make sure Jackson is okay and to give him his insurance info -- which he jots down on his very important file folder.  At this point, the two strangers become intimately involved ... they just don't know it yet.  The remainder of the movie pertains to the immense damage done to Jackson's life as the accident made him late for court, and he continues to struggle with his alcoholism.  And it also pertains to Affleck's personal journey to the dark side of his own personality, and back again, while trying to retrieve his precious document.  This movie gets very dark in exploring the worst possible scenario of this accident, and how a bad situation can tip off and escalate into a worse one.  Fortunately, there is a positive turn and message in the end, but it's a long, drawn-out, dark road getting there.  If you're like me, you figure out what's going on and what's going to happen very early on in the movie, so it seems that much slower.  Also, as a big fan of comedies and romantic comedies, this movie was not at all my kind of flick -- I found it depressing.

I wrote it off when it came out years ago as something I might watch one day, but nothing that would be special.The truth is, it's an excellent movie.  The script is taut and well written, and the performances are solid.  Like so many similar films, the entire plot takes place in one day.  But unlike many of those films, we actually get a complete picture of every single character's life just from this brief, less than 12-hour glimpse.Sam Jackson plays Doyle Gipson, a recovering alcoholic desperate to keep his children from being moved to Chicago by their angry mother.  Ben Affleck is Gavin Banek, a lawyer who has no idea how slimy a person he's allowed himself to become.  Just because of a single car accident, these two men cross paths and continue to cross each other throughout the film, due to bad timing, a series of missed chances and moral wrong turns and a hell of a lot of bad choices on both their parts.Toni Collette, the late great Sydney Pollack, Dylan Baker and Amanda Peet are just a few of the supporting players who shine in this film, despite their relative lack of screen time.  Best of all is Kim Staunton as Sam Jackson's soon-to-be ex-wife, who brings a completely believable amount of pain and passion to the screen each time she's on it.  All of them are well served by Chap Taylor's fantastic screenplay.  It's amazing that a writer this great hasn't done any movies since.  It just goes to show that in Hollywood, it's not talent that counts, it's the almighy dollar.  If this movie had been a bigger hit, he'd be a household name by now.Depsite their success and fame, I believe that Sam Jackson and Ben Affleck are both underrated as actors.  It's their own fault, really.  Both of them have starred in a number of terrible movies, presumably just for the payday.  And those bad choices mean that people (myself included) are more likely to skip their movies, and therefore miss gems like this in the process.  I don't believe this one was for the payday.  I think they both must have seen something special here, and it's a shame that more people haven't seen the same thing.  I hope others realize their mistake as I have, and give this deserving movie another chance.(I watched this film online and therefore cannot comment on the DVD extras.

595672,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JL5F,K. Driscoll,"[18, 19]","South African director Roger Michell directs this hit suspense thriller starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson.  Michell is actually very skilled and has a tremendous amount of mainstream appeal.  He also directed last years Venus, which was another solid film albeit very different from Changing Lanes.  Ben Affleck plays Gavin, a successful Wall Street attorney who must file a power of appointment for his company, which is run by his father-in-law played by Sydney Pollack.  The document will sign a company over to his law firm and that company is owned by a dying man.  Ethical questions certainly surround the document and as things unfold we find out even more.  Doyle is played by Samuel L. Jackson, he is an insurance salesman and a recovering alcoholic who wants badly to restore his family before his wife takes his children away to the west coast.  We get the feeling that Doyle is a wounded man and his actions are unacceptable at times.  Actually both characters are deeply flawed and that is what makes their collision so engaging.On his way to court to file this crucial document, Gavin gets into a car accident with Doyle.  He doesn't prioritize the accident and instead must leave the scene to make it to court on time.  Doyle's car will not drive and he is in the middle of a highway median when Gavin takes off in a rush.  It of course begins to rain.  Doyle himself was on his way to court and when he eventually gets there he finds out that he is too late.  His goal was to surprise his wife with a mortgage loan he just received so his family would stay.  He was attempting to get some resolution to whatever chaos he may have caused his family before this movie begins.  Unfortunately for Gavin the power of appointment was left at the scene of the accident and is in Doyle's possession.  Doyle, sour for being left in the rain on the highway and missing his chance in court, refuses to give Gavin the document.  Needless to say they both have reasonable vendettas against one another and the battle they have escalates throughout as the film goes forward.  These two men are basically dehumanized to one another and it doesn't help matters that they both come from entirely different worlds. They are opposites in life, so they are fundamentally opposed to one another when the first sign of conflict surfaces.  It turns out that Changing Lanes evolves into a unique commentary on the darkest sides of human nature.  It is unique because we visit these dark decisions by way of likeable and real character portrayals.  To avoid spoilers, I won't reveal anymore than I have already.Samuel L. Jackson is obviously an outstanding actor and he is great here but the most surprising thing is Ben Affleck matches him and then some.  It's a shame Ben's reputation as an actor was so horrible at the time Changing Lanes came out because his performance definitely deserved some praise.  Sydney Pollack is also outstanding as an exceptionally believable and accessible villain.  A lot of the credit goes to the screenplay here for exposing pragmatic reactions to specific circumstances instead of superficial morality.  There are no purely ethical and moral figures in Changing Lanes, but then again I can't think of too many in real life either.  If they did exist in Changing Lanes then its commentary would be disrupted completely, but I still held out hoping reason would creek into the picture.  Chaos reigns here and humanity is called upon to prevail.  It puts suspense on a much larger societal scale for me.  I know that the ending bothered those hoping for something more retributive but try to see Changing Lanes as a story about healing, not revenge.",5,One of the Most Underrated Movies in Years,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,3683,"['South', 'African', 'director', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'hit', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Michell', 'actually', 'very', 'skilled', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'mainstream', 'appeal', 'also', 'directed', 'last', 'years', 'Venus', 'was', 'solid', 'film', 'albeit', 'very', 'different', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Gavin', 'successful', 'Wall', 'Street', 'attorney', 'who', 'must', 'file', 'power', 'appointment', 'company', 'run', 'father-in-law', 'played', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'document', 'will', 'sign', 'company', 'law', 'firm', 'company', 'owned', 'dying', 'man', 'Ethical', 'questions', 'certainly', 'surround', 'document', 'things', 'find', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'Doyle', 'played', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'badly', 'restore', 'family', 'wife', 'children', 'away', 'west', 'coast', 'get', 'feeling', 'Doyle', 'wounded', 'man', 'actions', 'are', 'unacceptable', 'times', 'Actually', 'characters', 'are', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'what', 'collision', 'engaging.On', 'way', 'court', 'file', 'crucial', 'document', 'Gavin', 'car', 'accident', 'Doyle', ""n't"", 'prioritize', 'accident', 'instead', 'must', 'leave', 'scene', 'make', 'court', 'time', 'Doyle', 'car', 'will', 'not', 'drive', 'middle', 'highway', 'median', 'when', 'Gavin', 'off', 'rush', 'course', 'begins', 'rain', 'Doyle', 'was', 'way', 'court', 'when', 'eventually', 'there', 'out', 'too', 'late', 'goal', 'was', 'surprise', 'wife', 'mortgage', 'loan', 'just', 'received', 'so', 'family', 'would', 'stay', 'was', 'attempting', 'get', 'resolution', 'whatever', 'chaos', 'may', 'have', 'caused', 'family', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'Gavin', 'power', 'appointment', 'was', 'left', 'scene', 'accident', 'Doyle', 'possession', 'Doyle', 'sour', 'being', 'left', 'rain', 'highway', 'missing', 'chance', 'court', 'give', 'Gavin', 'document', 'Needless', 'say', 'have', 'reasonable', 'vendettas', 'one', 'battle', 'have', 'escalates', 'film', 'forward', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'basically', 'dehumanized', 'one', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'come', 'entirely', 'different', 'worlds', 'are', 'opposites', 'life', 'are', 'fundamentally', 'opposed', 'one', 'when', 'first', 'sign', 'conflict', 'surfaces', 'out', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'unique', 'commentary', 'darkest', 'sides', 'human', 'nature', 'unique', 'visit', 'dark', 'decisions', 'way', 'likeable', 'real', 'character', 'portrayals', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anymore', 'have', 'already.Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'obviously', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'great', 'here', 'most', 'surprising', 'thing', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'then', 'shame', 'Ben', 'reputation', 'actor', 'was', 'so', 'horrible', 'time', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'came', 'out', 'performance', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'praise', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'also', 'outstanding', 'exceptionally', 'believable', 'accessible', 'villain', 'lot', 'credit', 'screenplay', 'here', 'exposing', 'pragmatic', 'reactions', 'specific', 'circumstances', 'instead', 'superficial', 'morality', 'are', 'purely', 'ethical', 'moral', 'figures', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'then', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'many', 'real', 'life', 'either', 'did', 'exist', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'then', 'commentary', 'would', 'be', 'disrupted', 'completely', 'still', 'held', 'out', 'hoping', 'reason', 'would', 'creek', 'picture', 'Chaos', 'here', 'humanity', 'called', 'prevail', 'suspense', 'much', 'larger', 'societal', 'scale', 'know', 'ending', 'bothered', 'hoping', 'something', 'more', 'retributive', 'try', 'see', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'story', 'healing', 'not', 'revenge']",N/A

Jackson was involved.  The story is about two men who do not have time for a freeway fender bender.  Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer who has some important papers to file to prove an ailing millionaire signed over control of his foundation to Banek's law firm.  Doyle Gipson (Jackson), also has to get to court so he can show he got approved for a loan to buy a house so that his wife will not move with his two sons to Oregon.  The accident itself is really nobody's fault, but everything that happens after words in this escalating war of words and deeds can be laid at the feet of Gavin and Doyle, who dive off into the deep end.The movie ads proclaimed &quot;One wrong turn deserves another,&quot; and it helps set the audience up for the carnage these two reap on each other's lives as their frustrations give way to anger.  They have good reason to be frustrated: Doyle gets to court too late and his last chance to keep his family together is gone; Gavin arrives at court only to discover he has left the most important document behind.  It turns out that this document is so important that not having it can put him and the bosses at his firm, including his father-in-law, in prison.  These are two men whose lives have come to major crossroads.  This is news to Gavin, but the impact is not less than it is on Doyle.The trailer for &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; emphasizes the horrible things these two men manage to do to each other during the course of what is clearly the worst days of their lives.  Gavin uses a computer wizard to destroy Doyle's credit rating.  Doyle loosen the bolts on the wheel of Gavin's car.  If somebody does not end up dead by the end of this film, then we are all going to be very much surprised.  But that is what makes this film worth watching is that it is surprising, as when Gavin and Doyle both discover the true value of the lives they have been trying to lead are found in the women they have married (Amanda Peet and Kim Stauton respectively).Ultimately, it is the ability of the script by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin to surprises us and lifts &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; above the standard Hollywood tale of urban violence.  These two men could be cartoonish figures, but they become fully developed characters; not because of what they do to each other, but because of what they articulate about their lives in talking to others.

595676,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JL5F,Linda Linguvic,"[7, 8]","Starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson, this is the story of how a seemingly small fender-bender incident changed the lives of two men forever. Affleck is cast as Gavin Banek, a young Wall Street lawyer married to the boss's daughter, who is on his way to court to file some papers that were obtained unethically. He doesn't have the document with him, however, and realizes he  lost it during his encounter with Jackson on the expressway. Jackson, cast as Doyle Gibson, is a recovering alcoholic, who is also on his way to court.  He's in the process of obtaining a mortgage on a modest house and is trying to keep his wife from moving across the country with his two young sons. When he is 20 minutes late for the custody hearing, he loses his case. Both men are now hurtled into a series of confrontations with the kind ofescalating intensity that kept my eyes glued to the screen as the tension increased.The screenplay, by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin, was excellent, and kept the audience not only wondering what would happen next, but also gradually understanding the character of each man, and how this affected their next moves.  The plot twisted and turned as the men became more and more real, with the human frailties that hurtled the action along, showing how the way that each had been living his life contributed to what would happen next. Some deeply moral and ethical questions were raised with no easy answers. And in, at the end, as each man had to deal with his own personal demons, the conclusion was resolved on a positive note, leaving everyone wiser.Roger Michell, the director, was able to get outstanding performances out of all of the supporting cast members, as well as the stars - most notably Toni Collette as a colleague and sometime mistress of Affleck, Amanda Peet as his wife, Sidney Pollack as the head of the law firm, and Kim Staunton as Jackson's wife.  The New York setting was also wonderful and I'm glad that a decision was made not to edit out the World Trade Towers.  It was a real and important part of New York, and I personally enjoyed seeing them there, a visual reminder of how quickly things can change, which fit in perfectly with the story.I highly recommend this film, not just for the action, but also for the uncompromising view of how a person's character determines the outcome of situations and the hard choices that have to be made every day.

Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson are two of these people. They are two men who are brought, seemingly by fate --or at least, by an extremely contrived script-- into a head-on collision with each other. Affleck is an attorney involved in a morally ambiguous case involving control of a foundation. Jackson is a struggling insurance salesman involved in a custody battle. Actually, they literally do have a collision, though it's more of a fender bender than head-on. Both of them are due in court in mere minutes. Affleck offers Jackson a blank check to cover any damages; Jackson refuses, insisting on doing things ""the right way."" I may be cynical, but I suspect it would be rare outside of a film for someone to refuse a blank check offered by a wealthy attorney (probably even rarer for an attorney to make such an offer). It turns out that this accident has devastating consequences for each of them. Affleck leaves a vital file with Jackson. Jackson, in turn, loses custody of his children. From here, the plot turns from contrived to idiotic. Affleck desperately wants to get back his file. So what does he do? He hires a sleazy private investigator/hacker to destroy Jackson's credit. This sets into motion a spiraling cycle of revenge, with both of them becoming increasingly desperate and deranged. What is supposed to give the film depth and meaning is the fact that they both have consciences. We get to watch Jackson's tortured expression, for instance, as he watches Affleck almost die in a car crash he (Jackson) caused. Affleck, in turn, manages to get Jackson arrested, but we can see how terrible he feels as he watches his antagonist's wife and children suffer through the experience. There is a great deal of soul searching in this film, many discussions about ethics and a heavy-handed expose of the legal profession. It is hardly headline news that many corporate lawyers are less than pristine in their ethics. This point is hammered home by a completely unconvincing scene between Affleck and his wife (whose father, naturally, he works for). This  pretty and demure women tells her husband, in the middle of his crisis of conscience, how things are --that everything is based on fraud and deceit, but that he just has to grin and bear it. These are not the words a corporate wife, but of a Hollywood screenwriter who despises lawyers. What Changing Lanes lacks overall is credibility. Good people can surely make mistakes, even serious ones. But one after the other, on a single day (many of which are felonies)? By the time the tediously escalating conflict is resolved, we are supposed to be in awe at how much everyone has learned. The problem is, if they had behaved in a remotely sane manner earlier, none of the calamaties would have occurred in the first place.",2,"Good Acting, Lacks Credibility",1032048000,"09 15, 2002",2002,2920,"['best', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'how', 'world', 'tempting', 'basically', 'good', 'people', 'behave', 'very', 'bad', 'ways', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'brought', 'seemingly', 'fate', 'least', 'extremely', 'contrived', 'script', 'head-on', 'collision', 'other', 'Affleck', 'attorney', 'involved', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'case', 'involving', 'control', 'foundation', 'Jackson', 'struggling', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'involved', 'custody', 'battle', 'Actually', 'literally', 'do', 'have', 'collision', 'more', 'fender', 'bender', 'head-on', 'are', 'due', 'court', 'mere', 'minutes', 'Affleck', 'Jackson', 'blank', 'check', 'cover', 'damages', 'Jackson', 'insisting', 'doing', 'things', 'right', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'cynical', 'suspect', 'would', 'be', 'rare', 'film', 'someone', 'refuse', 'blank', 'check', 'offered', 'wealthy', 'attorney', 'probably', 'even', 'rarer', 'attorney', 'make', 'such', 'offer', 'out', 'accident', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'Affleck', 'vital', 'file', 'Jackson', 'Jackson', 'turn', 'custody', 'children', 'here', 'plot', 'contrived', 'idiotic', 'Affleck', 'desperately', 'get', 'back', 'file', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'sleazy', 'private', 'investigator/hacker', 'destroy', 'Jackson', 'credit', 'motion', 'spiraling', 'cycle', 'revenge', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'deranged', 'What', 'supposed', 'give', 'film', 'depth', 'meaning', 'fact', 'have', 'consciences', 'get', 'watch', 'Jackson', 'tortured', 'expression', 'instance', 'Affleck', 'almost', 'die', 'car', 'crash', 'Jackson', 'caused', 'Affleck', 'turn', 'get', 'Jackson', 'arrested', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'terrible', 'antagonist', 'wife', 'children', 'suffer', 'experience', 'great', 'deal', 'soul', 'searching', 'film', 'many', 'discussions', 'ethics', 'heavy-handed', 'expose', 'legal', 'profession', 'hardly', 'headline', 'news', 'many', 'corporate', 'lawyers', 'are', 'less', 'pristine', 'ethics', 'point', 'hammered', 'home', 'completely', 'unconvincing', 'scene', 'Affleck', 'wife', 'father', 'naturally', 'pretty', 'demure', 'women', 'husband', 'middle', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'everything', 'based', 'fraud', 'deceit', 'just', 'grin', 'bear', 'are', 'not', 'words', 'corporate', 'wife', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'lawyers', 'What', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'lacks', 'overall', 'credibility', 'Good', 'people', 'can', 'surely', 'make', 'mistakes', 'even', 'serious', 'ones', 'one', 'other', 'single', 'day', 'many', 'are', 'felonies', 'time', 'tediously', 'escalating', 'conflict', 'resolved', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'awe', 'how', 'much', 'everyone', 'learned', 'problem', 'had', 'behaved', 'remotely', 'sane', 'manner', 'earlier', 'none', 'calamaties', 'would', 'have', 'occurred', 'first', 'place']",N/A
595678,A2XVRCU5DQBULH,B00005JL5F,"L. Varnau ""nerff20""","[1, 1]","Ben Affleck has really grown as an actor in the past year. This is his best performance since &quot;Chasing Amy,&quot; and that's a hard one to beat. He plays Gavin, a lawyer who gets in an auto accident with Doyle, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Doyle gets his hands on some documents that Gavin needs for a case that very day and thus the two get into a cat-and-mouse escapade that feels surprisingly real as things unfold. The one thing this movie contains is an element of harsh realism and believability. Our characters are well scripted and the audience really understands them. We're never once asked to like our characters nor hate them. Instead, we are asked to empathize with them, especially Doyle, who is having family trouble and because of the accident is late to his divorce hearing. The one character we should like is Doyle, but even he has his faults. William Hurt plays an AA mentor who bails Doyle out of jail at one point and the two have a well-scripted conversation in which Hurt points out the faults of Jackson's character. &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; is definitely not a cheery film, but it is great in that the characters are three-dimensional and the acting is extremely good, especially from Affleck and Jackson. While this may not be one of Samuel L. Jackson's best films, at least it showcases Affleck as a talented, capable actor.

595679,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JL5F,Matthew Horner,"[3, 6]","""Changing Lanes"" is a thriller blessed with an unusually intelligent script by Charles Taylor and Michael Tolkin. Though a little preachy at times and a bit too pat [especially at the end], it manages to bypass many of the cliches we have become accustomed to in such films. It casts an unflinching eye on its characters and their place in a world which sometimes seems to have lost its moral compass. Directed at a brisk pace by Roger Michell [""Notting Hill""] and beautifully photographed by Salvatore Totino, ""Changes Lanes"" is a thinking man's thriller. [The testosterone and adrenaline crowd should probably pass on this one because nothing is blown up and nobody dies.]On a cold New York morning, we find two men racing to court. Doyle [Samuel L. Jackson] is going to Family Court to try to prevent his wife from moving to Oregon with their two boys. Gavin [Ben Affleck] is a lawyer who's on his way to Probate Court to seal a deal that's of great benefit to his high-powered law firm. Along the way they are involved in a fender bender. Gavin is polite at first but becomes increasingly agitated when Doyle wants to take his time `doing the right thing'. He winds up leaving Doyle stranded. Consequently, Doyle is late to court and loses his case. Gavin, meanwhile, arrives at his destination only to find he has accidentally left an important document in Doyle's possession. Without it, he can not win his case. What ensues is an increasingly nasty game of ""Gotcha"" between two very angry men, neither of whom is entirely right or wrong.Few mainstream movies ask us to examine current moral values or to question the ways in which we deal with each other. Fewer still question the value of righteous anger. ""Changing Lanes"" doesn't hesitate to address these issues head on.

At times, it seems like you're back in school, with two little boys in the playground accusing each other of starting it first.The thing that does get me sometimes, is the fact that Samuel L Jackson seems to play the exact same role, and you can recognise the role he has played many times before. Maybe that's just me.The trailer doesn't do anything for the film, the trailer seems to say it's more fast paced than it actually is.

Banek takes off leaving Gipson stranded, never realizing that he has dropped the most important file that he will need to win his court case.  What follows is a true case of eye for an eye as Gipson, losing his family by being late to the hearing, decides to pay Banek back for his hospitality.Samuel L.

Every other character is a plot device existing only to influence Jackson and Affleck in their escalating war against each other. The only exception is Toni Collette as Affleck's colleague and ex-lover, and her character becomes steadily less significant as the film progresses. Thus the film becomes simultaneously too claustrophobic and too scattered; since Jackson and Affleck share very little screen time, they spend most of their performances wandering among ciphers. This is too bad, because Jackson's controlled rage--which suddenly flares with hellfire fury--is very impressive, as is Affleck's delicate balancing act with conflicting feelings of smugness, frustration and remorse.

It starts off well, with two characters that at least aren't boring or ordinary.  The premise has Matt Damon as a hotshot young lawyer who crashes into Samuel L Jackson's recovering drunk on the highway.  Rather than giving him his insurance details or helping the guy whose car is wrecked, Damon runs off to court simply saying 'Better luck next time'.Things gets twisted though when he realises that he left the file crucial to winning over his corrupt case in the hands of Jackson, who incidentally couldn't get to court in time to argue for custody of his children.  What follows is mainly a list of mind games as Damon's character resorts to ever more dirty methods in forcing Jackson to hand over the important files, punctuated only by his ambiguous feelings towards colleague Toni Collette.  What's presumably meant to come of all this is Damon realises that the law is a dirty business and that the world is a corrupt place devoid of happiness.The most interesting thing about the movie is definitely the characterisation though, with both Jackson and, surprisingly, Damon, on fine form.  Neither are particularly likeable characters even if the movie does a good job of showing what motivates them to do what they do.  Indeed, there's a good sense of desperation that runs throughout this.  This leads to a question over who you're supposed to be rooting for exactly.  However, towards the end it becomes all too obvious that the filmmakers were obviously not too keen on an ambiguous ending and instead crudely inserted a moral resolution for Damon and let him keep his job as well as ensure that Jackson isn't left out in the cold.  All of this is presided over by some absolutely cringe-worthy calypso music at the end.  It's such a shame that a good, high-concept thriller like this was so swiftly turned around to something formulaic and dull.

595695,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JL5F,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[8, 10]","Changing Lanes, directed by Roger Michell (Notting Hill), is an urban morality tale that centres around a road rage conflict that escalates out of control following a fender bender between an obnoxious yuppie lawyer (Ben Affleck) and a recovering alcoholic (Samuel L Jackson) desperately trying to rebuild his family life. From what should have been an easily resolved accident their row escalates into an obsessive conflict in which the ante is continually upped as they set about bringing misery and revenge to each others lives.Despite the mixed reviews I found this to be a very intelligent and well-acted movie. Unlike most mainstream Hollywood movies it has both a point and some meaning. It offers a very insightful snapshot of the dog eat dog world that we currently co-exist in, where people are in constant competition with each other and (selfishly) no longer show any thought, courtesy, compassion or consideration for each other. In many ways Changing Lanes is an Indie movie in Hollywood clothing. However, it boasts two strong male leads in Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson, who both portray their opposing characters with depth, range and subtlety. In particular, it is refreshing to see Ben Affleck in something more substantial. The poor guy has taken such a fearful battering from critics since the ill-conceived Pearl Harbour but despite this he has made something of a comeback this year with both Changing Lanes and The Sum of All Fears. Like it or not, Ben Affleck IS a big star with a bright future. Samuel L Jackson, once again shows what a very versatile actor he is. He can be cool, he can be powerful, he can dominate the screen or as he does in this movie he can show a range of depth and subtlety beyond the vast majority of other actors. However, it is Toni Collette (Muriels Wedding, The Sixth Sense, About A Boy etc.) and legendary film producer/Director Sydney Pollack (in a rare acting appearance) that, to my mind, are the stars of this particular show in their respective supporting roles as Affleck's ex-mistress/confidante and boss/father in law. Pollack in particular gives a powerful performance as a charming father figure who switches at the drop of the hat to be a ruthless and vindictive morally corrupt businessman.If there is a downside to this movie, it's the ending. If this was truly an Independent movie and not a Paramount produced project, then it surely would have had an ending more befitting reality and more befitting the tone of the film, with no redemption for anybody. Instead however, what we get is ultimately a cop-out (Hollywood) and they all lived happily ever after ending. Despite that though, given the worthiness of this tale and the top-notch acting performances from a fine cast, I still think its worth a go and worthy of 3.5 stars.  : )",4,WORTHY MORALITY TALE: 3.5 STARS,1039651200,"12 12, 2002",2002,2810,"['Changing', 'Lanes', 'directed', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'urban', 'morality', 'tale', 'road', 'rage', 'conflict', 'control', 'following', 'fender', 'bender', 'obnoxious', 'yuppie', 'lawyer', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'desperately', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'family', 'life', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'resolved', 'accident', 'row', 'obsessive', 'conflict', 'ante', 'continually', 'upped', 'set', 'bringing', 'misery', 'revenge', 'others', 'lives.Despite', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'intelligent', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'most', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'point', 'meaning', 'very', 'insightful', 'snapshot', 'dog', 'eat', 'dog', 'world', 'currently', 'co-exist', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'constant', 'competition', 'other', 'selfishly', 'no', 'longer', 'show', 'thought', 'courtesy', 'compassion', 'consideration', 'other', 'many', 'ways', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'Indie', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'clothing', 'However', 'two', 'strong', 'male', 'leads', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'portray', 'opposing', 'characters', 'depth', 'range', 'subtlety', 'particular', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'something', 'more', 'substantial', 'poor', 'guy', 'taken', 'fearful', 'battering', 'critics', 'ill-conceived', 'Pearl', 'Harbour', 'made', 'something', 'comeback', 'year', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'not', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'big', 'star', 'bright', 'future', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'very', 'versatile', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'cool', 'can', 'be', 'powerful', 'can', 'dominate', 'screen', 'movie', 'can', 'show', 'range', 'depth', 'subtlety', 'vast', 'majority', 'other', 'actors', 'However', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Muriels', 'Wedding', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Boy', 'etc', 'legendary', 'film', 'producer/Director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'rare', 'acting', 'appearance', 'mind', 'are', 'stars', 'particular', 'show', 'respective', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Affleck', 'ex-mistress/confidante', 'boss/father', 'law', 'Pollack', 'particular', 'powerful', 'performance', 'charming', 'father', 'figure', 'who', 'drop', 'hat', 'be', 'ruthless', 'vindictive', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'businessman.If', 'downside', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'truly', 'Independent', 'movie', 'not', 'Paramount', 'produced', 'project', 'then', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'ending', 'more', 'befitting', 'reality', 'more', 'befitting', 'tone', 'film', 'redemption', 'anybody', 'Instead', 'however', 'what', 'get', 'ultimately', 'cop-out', 'Hollywood', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'ending', 'given', 'worthiness', 'tale', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'performances', 'fine', 'cast', 'still', 'think', 'worth', 'go', 'worthy', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

The movie takes places in New York, where a car accident at the beginning of the movie brings together Affleck, an attorney at a prestigious law firm named Gavin Banek, and Jackson, as recovering alcoholic Doyle Gipson who is trying to prevent his ex-wife from moving to Oregon with his two children. Gipson's car is broken down with a flat tire and he's due in child custody court. Banek is too busy to help, and he races off to his own appointment at court, where he is to present documents to the judge which prove that a old, dying man had left millions to the law firm instead of rewarding his surviving relatives. The crucial legal documents he needed for court were left behind at the scene of the car accident.  Gipson, because of his tardiness loses any claim to visitation or custody of his children which means his ex-wife will move the children with her to Oregon. Gipson has Banek's files, however, which keeps these two tied together, and a game of revenge between the two begins. ""I just want my time back,"" Gipson explains to Banek, trying to get the man to empathize with his problems. Banek's career is on the line, and without those papers the law firm could be duly implicated in criminal fraud.This is a fantastic drama with many complexities and great characters.

I wasn't disappointed.Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Affleck play their parts superbly: Affleck as the affluent Wall Street lawyer with a conscience, and Jackson as the blue-collar black man with marital difficulties. Their chance meeting happens when their two cars collide and Affleck unwittingly leaves some important documents with Jackson. The rest of the movie deals with how both men try to punish each other for what they perceive are injustices to themselves.The film is pretty slow to start, but once you get over the half way mark and the stage is set, the story becomes more engaging. The movie explores what it means to have a conscience in today's dog-eat-dog, humanist society where morality seems to have become relative. Affleck has conflicts about the rightness of his actions when he is told by his bosses to forge the document that he has lost to Jackson. He struggles to find meaning in the world and isn't satisfied by his money hungry girlfriend or boss who both try to dismiss his inner conflict.Both men's lives become connected by that one incident and it seems almost as if ""God has put them in a brown paper bag...and let them have a go at each other"" Jackson's hot temper and alcoholism has led to a loss of his wife and children and the accident earlier in the day with Affleck leads to him losing custody over his children.I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a good `thinking' movie.

The direction of Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") is outstanding! And the top-notch performances from Samuel L. Jackson (""Shaft"") and Ben Affleck (""The Sum of All Fears"") were played with perfection all the way! The film centers around two men: The first man is Doyle Gipson (Jackson), a recovering alcoholic who tries to pick up the pieces of his once happy marriage and tries to provide for his family by buying a house for them. The other man is Gavin Banek (Affleck), an ambitious high-powered attorney involved in a shady deal with his business partners who are biking a charity. Doyle Gipson and Gavin Banek had no reason to meet...until that fateful day on the freeway. The two men are in a rush to get to their court appointments when a fender bender puts them behind schedule. Banek's rushed handling of the situation, including leaving the scene of the accident saying the words ""Better luck next time!"", has resulted in Gipson not only being late for his court appointment, but he also lost custody of his kids and it looks like he might not see them again. As for Banek, well, not only is he also late for court, he has also lost a very important file of his...at the scene of the accident...with Doyle Gipson! And not only does this mean that Banek has lost the file, it could also cost him his job and his freedom as well! So what started out as a simple fender bender on the freeway became a conflict between two different men...each with two different agendas...and one with a very important file that the other wants back as soon as possible. And the film goes on from there. ""Changing Lanes"" is a contemporary American thriller that will keep you on the edge of the seat from start to unforgettable finish!

Changing Lanes is one such movie.The 2002 drama aired last Thursday on My9 Network in the New York City area, and once again I found myself deeply engrossed in the drama of two motorists (Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson) who, after getting into an accident on a New York City highway, proceed to turn each other's life upside down and in the process become unraveled by their own doing. What starts out as a road rage thriller turns into a soul-baring personal journey of self-discovery and the quest for ethical equilibrium in a world in which the end justifies the means.Dylan Baker exudes reptilian slime as a cyber ""fixer"" who helps Affleck unleash virtual demons on Jackson. And the outstanding William Hurt provides great support as Jackson's Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who tries to rescue Jackson from demons in a bottle.I am not a fan of Affleck, and Jackson is more fun and larger than life in his big franchise roles such as the Star Wars prequels and the Marvel superhero movies and kitsch such as Shaft, Snakes on a Plane, and The Other Guys. However, Changing Lanes stands among the finest work of both of their careers and is a cinematic gem worth seeking out.",5,The RajMan (Fan) Review,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,1533,"['are', 'movies', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'as', 'long', 'live', 'are', 'movies', 'regardless', ""'re"", 'good', 'bad', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'good', 'life', 'then', 'are', 'movies', 'fall', 'camp', 'were', 'so', 'compelling', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'opportunity', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'one', 'such', 'movie.The', '2002', 'drama', 'aired', 'last', 'Thursday', 'My9', 'Network', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'area', 'once', 'again', 'found', 'deeply', 'engrossed', 'drama', 'two', 'motorists', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'getting', 'accident', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'highway', 'proceed', 'turn', 'other', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'process', 'become', 'unraveled', 'own', 'doing', 'What', 'out', 'road', 'rage', 'thriller', 'soul-baring', 'personal', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'quest', 'ethical', 'equilibrium', 'world', 'end', 'means.Dylan', 'Baker', 'reptilian', 'slime', 'cyber', 'fixer', 'who', 'Affleck', 'unleash', 'virtual', 'demons', 'Jackson', 'outstanding', 'William', 'Hurt', 'great', 'support', 'Jackson', 'Alcoholics', 'Anonymous', 'sponsor', 'who', 'rescue', 'Jackson', 'demons', 'bottle.I', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Affleck', 'Jackson', 'more', 'fun', 'larger', 'life', 'big', 'franchise', 'roles', 'such', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'movies', 'kitsch', 'such', 'Shaft', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'Other', 'Guys', 'However', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'finest', 'work', 'careers', 'cinematic', 'gem', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out']",N/A
595709,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JL5F,Reviewer,"[5, 5]","With the advent of the internet, all things electronic or digital, and fast food, our world has become altogether too small, and everything moves entirely too fast.  With so much happening all the time, everywhere, and with so many different ways to go, people have become preoccupied, which can be dangerous if the momentum propelling an individual happens to come to cross purposes with that same kind of momentum driving another, and the two converge.  And it happens.  ""Things"" happen; and when they do, the important thing is that all parties involved react responsibly and focus their individual attention on the matter at hand.  If either side fails in this regard, it can mean big trouble.  it means you suddenly have a situation; and it's just such a situation that is explored by director Roger Michell in ""Changing Lanes,"" a tension filled drama starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson.Gavin Banek (Affleck) is a successful lawyer, a partner in the firm and married to Cynthia (Amanda Peet), the daughter of his boss, Stephen Delano (Sydney Pollack).  He's currently handling a probate case worth millions to the firm; he's due in court, where he simply has to present a document that will, for all intents and purposes, wrap up the proceedings.  But fate is waiting in the wings.  In another part of town, Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) is also about to wrap up a deal-- a loan for a house that will keep his estranged wife, Valerie (Kim Staunton), from moving with their two boys, Stephen (Akil Walker) and Danny (Cole Hawkins), to Portland, Oregon, or as Doyle sees it, half way across the world.When Gavin and Doyle get into their respective cars to head to court, they are strangers to one another; they are about to meet, however, when heavy traffic on the expressway and their own preoccupied mental states precipitate a collision-- a minor car accident that ultimately effects a much bigger wreck in both their lives.  In his rush to meet his appointed court time, Gavin leaves the scene of the accident and, more importantly, leaves Doyle-- who also has an appointment in court (his child custody hearing, no less)-- stranded, and out of time.  Ironically, the document Gavin must file in court is inadvertently in the confusion of the accident left behind on the expressway, and is now in Doyle's hands.  And so the conundrum; loss of the document may mean jail time to Gavin.  To Doyle, the loss of twenty minutes may mean losing his children.  The question now is, how will these two men solve their dilemma?  One has what the other needs, but how do you give ""time"" back to someone?This film, nicely fashioned by screenwriters Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin, and extremely well crafted and delivered by director Michell, is at it's core a character study that examines the effects of desperation and the emotional responses elicited thereof.  It explores how anger and frustration can in the heat of the moment negatively affect even an individual who under normal circumstances is predisposed to abiding by his own conscience; how even the most rational among us has the capacity for irrational behavior if provoked by unmitigated circumstances.  At one point in the film, one of the characters observes that it's like two guys have been dropped into a paper bag together and shaken up, just to see what happens; and that about sums it up.  And Michell does an excellent job of keeping the story on track, setting a good pace and maintaining the tension that keeps the audience involved.  It's straightforward storytelling that is well presented and effective.As Gavin, Affleck gives a solid performance, developing his character quite nicely as the story unfolds.  When the film begins, Gavin is in a comfort zone, a place that allows him the tunnel vision necessary to do what he does with a clear conscience.  In a way, he's naive; a guy who's been led down the path and made to believe that all is well in the land of the free.  By the end of the film, we see a different Gavin-- or at least an ""awakened"" Gavin; the same man, perhaps, but with an entirely different perspective on life.  And Affleck's portrayal makes it convincing, and brings Gavin to life in a very real way.  A good job by a fine young actor with the ability to tap into that emotional depth that makes his character believable.Samuel L. Jackson hits his stride, as well, as Doyle, a character whose outward demeanor masks the complexities lying beneath the surface, but which Jackson brings incisively to light.  Doyle is your average guy, an insurance salesman, but a man plagued by the demons of addiction; he's a man addicted to chaos, evidenced by the failed relationships in his life and his inability to cope with the situation engendered by his encounter with Gavin.  Jackson creates a character with whom you can empathize, even as he makes you aware of the rage within him that could explode at any minute.  Doyle understands only too well the dire, probable consequences of being unable to quell his anger, and through his portrayal, Jackson makes the audience aware of it, as well; and it's a pivotal point in the story, which he successfully conveys.  And it's that unstable element of Doyle's personality that makes this more than just a story about right or wrong, or who's going to win; it means anything can happen, and it keeps you wondering right up to the end what that something is going to be.The supporting cast includes William Hurt (The Sponsor), Toni Collette (Michelle), Richard Jenkins (Walter), Tina Sloan (Mrs. Delano), Ileen Getz (Ellen), Sam Rovin (Paralegal) and Jennifer Dundas (Mina).  A morality tale that, be advised, does not take too kindly to lawyers, ""Changing Lanes"" is an engrossing film that delivers much than what is promised, even, by the trailers; a worthwhile cinematic experience.",4,"Solid Story, Performances",1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,5835,"['advent', 'internet', 'things', 'electronic', 'digital', 'fast', 'food', 'world', 'become', 'altogether', 'too', 'small',

Jackson's credit seems unrealistic, and an extreme measure that early in the movie. Also, the relationship between Samuel L. Jackson and his wife would have to be devloped more to really make sense in the context of the movie. In their first scene together, she is hollering at him in the courtroom.

595711,A1JIPFV4OL520T,B00005JL5F,Robert Wynkoop,"[1, 2]","Wow! What a movie.  It is a tale of revenge and redemption.  Great story, superb editing, and dynamite performances not only by Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson, but the supporting cast as well.  It is gratifying to find a movie made for adults who like to think.  If you are looking for the latest action thriller, this is not your movie; but if you are looking for a movie that will grab you by your throat and pulls you into the lives of its characters leaving you breathless Changing Lanes is for you.This is a story about redemption.  It is interesting to note that it takes place on Good Friday, the day that Christians remember the crucifixion of Jesus for the sins of the world.  Both characters are lost. Doyle Gipson (Samuel Jackson) is the middle class insurance salesmen whose violent temper and alcoholism has caused him to lose his family.  Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) is unlikable yuppie attorney who is being manipulated by his boss father-in-law.  These two men are brought together in an auto accident and when Gavin leaves the scene of the accident stranding Doyle by the side of the road beginning an escalating cycle of revenge begins that leaves the viewer wondering where it will end.The theme of redemption runs throughout the move.  The church is the background of several scenes, one involving as he struggles with his conscience with the priest in the confessional.  At the same time, Doyle is riding in the taxi looks at the cross dangling from the rearview mirror of the cab.Although the race card is not played, race is an issue.  Neither character uses it in their quest for revenge, but the scene of Doyle at the bar gives some insight into his rage.  His fury at the white man is demonstrated as he beats up the two advertising men outside the bar.  To his credit he shows a depth of character by not blaming racism for his failures in life.  I will not give the end of the movie away for those of you who have not seen it yet, but you would be hard pressed to find a movie as good as this.

595712,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JL5F,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","***1/2 Gavin Banek and Doyle Gibson are two gentlemen having one hell of a bad Good Friday.  While millions of people around the world are commemorating the crucifixion and atonement of Jesus Christ, Banek and Gibson find themselves acting out a little morality play of their own in the streets and skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan.  Along the way, they too will confront the issues of right and wrong, sin and redemption - and find out just how far into the depths of depravity their own moral codes will allow them to go.  Interestingly, the heightened unreality of some of the characters' more extreme actions brings to the tale much of the quality of a parable.  As a result, we don't have to believe every twist and turn of the plot in order to validate and appreciate it.As the title of the film suggests, the theme revolves around what happens when the paths of two very distinct lives ""accidentally"" intersect.  These two individuals are total strangers before fate, chance, providence, the gods - whatever you want to call it - conspire to bring them together.  Banek is a hotshot young attorney who has married into his father-in-law's wealthy firm, while Gibson is a recovering alcoholic and AA member who is trying desperately to close the deal on a house so that his fed-up wife won't move with their boys to Oregon, far away from Gibson's deleterious influence.  Both desperate to get to their respective court dates - Banek to argue an important case and Gibson to plead for one more chance to keep his family from moving away - the two harried men meet up in a mild fender bender during morning rush hour traffic.  When Banek callously palms Gibson off with a blank check and leaves him stuck in traffic to fend for himself, the wheels are set in motion for the strange, offbeat tale of revenge and recrimination that ensues.  In the confusion of the accident, Banek does not realize that he has accidentally left a crucial folder in Gibson's possession.  Gibson, mistreated by Banek at the scene of the accident and refused a hearing by the court because of his tardiness, finds himself in no mood to turn the other cheek and help Banek by returning his folder.  The resultant game of cat-and-mouse, which could so easily have devolved into a cheap, tawdry melodrama of violence and revenge, instead achieves surprising moments of thought provoking depth and insight.""Changing Lanes"" is, indeed, that rarity among American films: a drama more concerned with issues and ideas than with cheap thrills and emotional exploitation.  Within the context of a densely plotted thriller, writer Chap Taylor has fashioned a film that is nothing less than a study of the part ethics plays in our daily lives.  Like all of us, Banek and Gibson contain within their beings both the seeds of goodness and the germs of evil.  The question becomes how far each is willing to go to cultivate those qualities when faced with the dilemmas and vicissitudes life throws their way.  Both men, though basically decent at the core, find themselves doing deeds that surprise even themselves when pushed into a corner by despair and desperation.  Rarely in the movies do we find characters this concerned with analyzing both the motives and the consequences of their actions.  In fact the film plays out like a classic morality play, with each man engaging in an internal struggle with his conscience as well as with the other person.  The underlying cynical subtext is, of course, that, in the corporate business world, all morality is relative, a fact Banek, in particular, is ultimately forced to face up to - and, by extension, to act upon.Although it does seem to strain a bit to make its point every now and then - employing overemphasis when subtlety is what is really called for - the film boasts a number of beautiful and haunting moments such as when the director, Roger Michell, intercuts between a quiet, but highly charged and revelatory conversation Gibson has with his longsuffering wife and a scene of Banek seeking surcease from his guilt in a quiet confessional.Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson both do superb work at getting to the bottom of their respective characters' innermost feelings and thoughts.  David Arnold's somber musical score and Salvatore Totino's moody cinematography lend an appropriately otherworldly quality to this stark morality play, making the everyday world of city streets and soaring skyscrapers seem strangely twisted and menacing.""Changing Lanes"" does lose its nerve a little at the end, as evidenced by a certain softness in its resolution. Nevertheless, it still deserves enormous credit for attempting to do what few other films even have the courage to try.  It's truly refreshing to see a film that respects the intelligence of its audience and which provides moviegoers with a little nutritional sustenance to go along with all that cinematic junk food Hollywood normally provides for us in such abundance.",3,"provocative, thought provoking thriller",1018656000,"04 13, 2002",2002,4952,"['***1/2', 'Gavin', 'Banek', 'Doyle', 'Gibson', 'are', 'two',

However, few films capture the essence of true emotion, and throw out the question: ""What would you do?""  Changing Lanes did this for me, and made me ask myself, ""Would I do that?""Ben Affleck stars as Gavin Banek, a corporate lawyer out for blood on every case he is involved in.  When a small accident pits his wits against recovering alcoholic Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson), the beast within him leaves the poor old man stranded out in the rain with a flat tire and a head full of anger.  However, as fate would have it, Banek drops an important file that is vital for winning his case in the midst of stranding Gipson.What follows is the lust for who will come out the better man, both fighting to take back what they need.  However, this is not simply a morality tale, it is a tale tainted with reality.  I would not be surprised if this story has actually happened quite a few times, in many variations and forms.  This is the greatest film of 2002, and I think Academy Award nominations are in line.

This movie exceeds the extremeties at times and makes for a film that will either grab you or send you to the grocery store to look for the newest version of &quot;movie repellent!&quot;  Each scene is carefully structured here and the director of this film certainly knows how to create mood and tension between characters.

Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant.Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is alsodependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.VIDEO....The transfer to video does provide a sharper contrast and a somewhat more detailed appearance than its Standard Def counterpart.  However, I believe that is due to the transfer to a blu ray encode rather than a filmic remastering of the movie.  Color grading is fairly natural with skin tones as they should be.  Backgrounds are somewhat soft in appearance and overall colors tend to be slightly muted.  This is not a bad thing as a film like this is not a place to expect the popping colors of a Marvel Avengers movie.  At no point did I see any dropouts or artifacting and any film noise was not noticeable.  Mbps rates appeared to average in the mid 20's, not bad but not earth shaking either.  All in all, a good transfer but nothing to write home about, there is an improvement over the SD release but not by all that much.  4 stars for the videoAUDIO....The lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 audio provides a clean and transparentness to the dialogue.  However, I did notice that audio levels were a tad lower than normal and raised the volume via my remote.  Once properly set, I did not have to go back to the remote and play roller coaster with the volume control.  The music soundtrack was spread nicely across the front sound stage and there were a few traffic pans across that stage.  However, the rear channels as well as the LFE channel are pretty much ignored when there were plenty of opportunities to have properly incorporated them.  2.5 stars for the audio.Extras....Some very decent extras are included made up of deleted and extended scenes which I always enjoy.  Additionally there is a commentary by the directory, a 'Making Of' and a documentary regarding the writer's perspective as well as the film's trailer.I like this movie otherwise I would not have purchased it, and I am glad to have it on Blu Ray...just a bit disappointed that this film was only re encoded and not really remastered.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.

That premise is enough for a decent movie, but its power is doubled here by an intelligent moral subtext. What could have been just another urban action film becomes not only an exciting thriller, but a finely nuanced commentary on contemporary values: in a corrupt world, doing the right thing can be more revolutionary, more ""edgy"", than doing the wrong. Affleck is wonderful as Gavin Banek, the morally-conflicted Wall Street attorney desperately trying to recover a lost file; and Jackson, as Doyle Gipson, sets aside his trademark coolness to convincingly portray an estranged, alcoholic father struggling to salvage what's left of his life. The tone is elevated enormously by some inspired casting in the supporting roles: William Hurt as Doyle's AA sponsor; Sidney Pollack as Gavin's venal father-in-law and boss; Dylan Baker as an online Mr Fix-It; Toni Collette as Gavin's co-worker; and Amanda Peet as his pragmatically devoted wife. Roger Michell's direction is never self-consciously showy, yet perfectly captures the feeling of a frantic struggle through the oppressive streets of a rainy New York day. There are some speechy moments when the morality theme is hammered home a little too hard, but for the most part writers Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin manage to show it rather than say it, and at 99 minutes they know precisely when to cut it off. It isn't perfect - there are some odd jumps, sloppy writing (why is the stock market open on Good Friday?), and a heavy-handed bar scene that could've been cut.  Still, that this film could so easily have settled for being a cat-and-mouse story of visually spectacular revenge makes it all the more thrilling that it isn't. The artistry and intelligence of its creators and performers ensure that ""Changing Lanes"" is not only entertaining, but intellectually engaging on an entirely different level.",4,"Fresh, original and courageous",1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,1995,"['mid-morning', 'scrape', 'FDR', 'two', 'men', 'radically', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'become', 'locked', 'high-stakes', 'game', 'revenge', 'premise', 'enough', 'decent', 'movie', 'power', 'doubled', 'here', 'intelligent', 'moral', 'subtext', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'urban', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'commentary', 'contemporary', 'values', 'corrupt', 'world', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'revolutionary', 'more', 'edgy', 'doing', 'wrong', 'Affleck', 'wonderful', 'Gavin', 'Banek', 'morally-conflicted', 'Wall', 'Street', 'attorney', 'desperately', 'trying', 'recover', 'lost', 'file', 'Jackson', 'Doyle', 'Gipson', 'aside', 'trademark', 'coolness', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'estranged', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'struggling', 'salvage', 'what', 'left', 'life', 'tone', 'elevated', 'enormously', 'inspired', 'casting', 'supporting', 'roles', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Doyle', 'AA', 'sponsor', 'Sidney', 'Pollack', 'Gavin', 'venal', 'father-in-law', 'boss', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'online', 'Mr', 'Fix-It', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Gavin', 'co-worker', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'pragmatically', 'devoted', 'wife', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'direction', 'never', 'self-consciously', 'showy', 'yet', 'perfectly', 'feeling', 'frantic', 'struggle', 'oppressive', 'streets', 'rainy', 'New', 'York', 'day', 'are', 'speechy', 'moments', 'when', 'morality', 'theme', 'hammered', 'home', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'most', 'part', 'writers', 'Chap', 'Taylor', 'Michael', 'Tolkin', 'manage', 'show', 'rather', 'say', '99', 'minutes', 'know', 'precisely', 'when', 'cut', 'off', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'are', 'odd', 'jumps', 'sloppy', 'writing', 'why', 'stock', 'market', 'open', 'Good', 'Friday', 'heavy-handed', 'bar', 'scene', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cut', 'Still', 'film', 'could', 'so', 'easily', 'have', 'settled', 'being', 'cat-and-mouse', 'story', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'revenge', 'more', 'thrilling', ""n't"", 'artistry', 'intelligence', 'creators', 'performers', 'ensure', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'not', 'only', 'entertaining', 'intellectually', 'engaging', 'entirely', 'different', 'level']",N/A
595724,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,B00005JL5F,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[3, 4]","I was really impressed with the first thirty minutes or so of this film.  The movie is set in a very specific time and place - a rainy Good Friday in contemporary Manhattan (sometime before 9-11 as we see the World Trade Center and the release date was early 2002). In a morning auto accident hotshot Wall Street lawyer ""Gavin"" played by a barely adequate Ben Affleck hits a car driven by recovering alcoholic insurance salesman ""Doyle"" excellently portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson.  Both men are made late for court appearances and Affleck's character has inadvertently left an important legal file with Jackson  causing repercussions that lead to  escalating and improbable acts of revenge during the course of this spring Friday.One of the problems with the film is Affleck is unbelievable as Gavin as he does not impart the intelligence or drive one would expect to see in a rising Wall Street attorney.  One can never imagine him possessing the power and gravitas his father-in law (played by Sydney Pollock) commands as a senior partner.  Both his soft spoken pretty wife (Amanda Peet) and his career girl mistress (Toni Collette) are much stronger and decisive. Furthermore Gavin's ""ethics crisis""  seems phony as we are supposed to believe an insider in a high power firm is suddenly opposed to white collar flimflam when he is not above some evil mischief against Doyle or cheating on his wife.  Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Doyle a man who has anger and alcohol problems but desperately wants to get back in the good graces of his divorcing wife and two sons.  However he is so out of control (in one day we see him throw a computer through a bank window, beat up some characters he meets in a bar, attempt to kill Gavin by loosening his wheel and yell and scream at various other people) even when sober that it is difficult to believe he is functioning at all in life let alone on a job with some responsibility.

595725,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00005JL5F,Takis Tz.,"[3, 5]","Admittingly, my only reservation about seeing this film was that it included Ben Affleck in it. After recent disasters like ""Pearl Harbor"" and the ""Sum of all fears"" he's participated in, he's become an actor whose films i tend to avoid on principle.Having said that, i also have to admit that my concerns were proven wrong as Affleck does an excellent job here.But more to the specifics, ""Changing lanes"" is an excellent and mysteriously underrated thriller.With a plot based on revenge and the intense personality and determination of both characters to achieve their respective missionsthis film works very effectively until the end where ""Hollywooditis"" infects the ending and undermines an otherwise  great effort by all involved.Before that, we see a high profile lawyer (Affleck)on his way to the courthouse for an ultra important trial that is supposed to land him and his firm millions and put him for good in the top league. Bound for the very same courthouse is Doyle Gibson (Jackson) a middle class man with his life in shambles and with a last ditch plan to salvage his marriage at court as he has just taken a loan for a house which he hopes will convince his wife to return to him along with their kids.On their way (shades of doom-laden synchronicity) these 2 characters engage in a car accident. Affleck ignores Jackson's intentions to ""do things right"" and instead hands him a blank check and speeds off the scene while Jackson is left there with a crashed car and time running out for his court appearance. Affleck does reach the court in time but not so Jackson whos sees his last hopes going down the drain.But ar the scene of the accident Affleck loses a key document for his trial which lands in the hands of Jackson. Subsequently Affleck's trial becomes a non decision and unless he gets that document back his life is about to become shambles too.That's where the story takes off. Jackson with nothing much else left to lose decides he's going to have his revenge by not giving that document back. Affleck uses all his high-end connection to force or even terrorise Jackson, all to no avail as he finds out that he's really encountered the wrong man in the wrong situation.Credits to the scriptwritter for not indulging in any cheap tricks as he lays out the duel between the 2 main characters. The  script is indeed carefully plotted (but not contrived as many reviewers claim) and even though it does have a rather slow pace it never loses its grip on the viewer.Affleck and Jackson make two perfect poles of opposition and that without the need of the race card. As we see each of them exchange positions in holding the upper hand and the tricks and machinations being constantly renewed by both we still have no way to predict where this will all end up. While Jackson's performance is arguably no suprise (by now he's in no need of proving anything as an actor) it's Affleck who actually follows suit with a strong outing of his own.A great thriller that will only let you down in the very last scene, which, doesnt betray the plot but is definately not the appropriate ending for such a great film.",4,Mysteriously underrrated..,1047859200,"03 17, 2003",2003,3129,"['Admittingly', 'only', 'reservation', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'included', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'recent', 'disasters', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Sum', 'fears', 'participated', 'become', 'actor', 'films', 'i', 'tend', 'avoid', 'principle.Having', 'said', 'i', 'also', 'have', 'admit', 'concerns', 'were', 'proven', 'wrong', 'Affleck', 'excellent', 'job', 'here.But', 'more', 'specifics', 'Changing', 'lanes', 'excellent', 'mysteriously', 'underrated', 'thriller.With', 'plot', 'based', 'revenge', 'intense', 'personality', 'determination', 'characters', 'achieve', 'respective', 'missionsthis', 'film', 'very', 'effectively', 'end', 'where', 'Hollywooditis', 'ending', 'undermines', 'otherwise', 'great', 'effort', 'involved.Before', 'see', 'high', 'profile', 'lawyer', 'Affleck', 'way', 'courthouse', 'ultra', 'important', 'trial', 'supposed', 'land', 'firm', 'millions', 'put', 'good', 'top', 'league', 'Bound', 'very', 'same', 'courthouse', 'Doyle', 'Gibson', 'Jackson', 'middle', 'class', 'man', 'life', 'shambles', 'last', 'ditch', 'plan', 'salvage', 'marriage', 'court', 'just', 'taken', 'loan', 'house', 'will', 'convince', 'wife', 'return', 'kids.On', 'way', 'shades', 'doom-laden', 'synchronicity', '2', 'characters', 'engage', 'car', 'accident', 'Affleck', 'Jackson', 'intentions', 'do', 'things', 'right', 'instead', 'blank', 'check', 'speeds', 'off', 'scene', 'Jackson', 'left', 'crashed', 'car', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'court', 'appearance', 'Affleck', 'reach', 'court', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'Jackson', 'whos', 'last', 'hopes', 'going', 'drain.But', 'scene', 'accident', 'Affleck', 'key', 'document', 'trial', 'hands', 'Jackson', 'Subsequently', 'Affleck', 'trial', 'non', 'decision', 'document', 'back', 'life', 'become', 'shambles', 'where', 'story', 'off', 'Jackson', 'nothing', 'much', 'else', 'left', 'lose', 'going', 'have', 'revenge', 'not', 'giving', 'document', 'back', 'Affleck', 'high-end', 'connection', 'force', 'even', 'terrorise', 'Jackson', 'avail', 'out', 'really', 'encountered', 'wrong', 'man', 'wrong', 'situation.Credits', 'scriptwritter', 'not', 'indulging', 'cheap', 'tricks', 'out', 'duel', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'script', 'indeed', 'carefully', 'plotted', 'not', 'contrived', 'many', 'reviewers', 'claim', 'even', 'have', 'rather', 'slow', 'pace', 'never', 'grip', 'viewer.Affleck', 'Jackson', 'make', 'two', 'perfect', 'poles', 'opposition', 'need', 'race', 'card', 'see', 'exchange', 'positions', 'holding', 'upper', 'hand', 'tricks', 'machinations', 'being', 'constantly', 'renewed', 'still', 'have', 'way', 'predict', 'where', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'Jackson', 'performance', 'arguably', 'suprise', 'now', 'need', 'proving', 'anything', 'actor', 'Affleck', 'who', 'actually', 'suit', 'strong', 'outing', 'own.A', 'great', 'thriller', 'will', 'only', 'let', 'down', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'plot', 'definately', 'not', 'appropriate', 'ending', 'such', 'great', 'film']",N/A
595726,A3863M2049OPN3,B00005JL5F,The Bus,"[1, 2]","So I went to see this expecting to see two guys trying ruin each other's lives. Well, most of the action scenes are shown in the commercial, which misleads people to think that this is an action movie. In truth, it is more drama and suspense. The movie is really about how one person (s. jackson) blames everybody else but himself for his problems and does not find peace with himself until he finally accepts that he is really the one to blame.  The other main character (b. affleck) is a good person who justified to himself that bad things he was doing were really ok. Once he comes to his senses and accepts what he was doing was wrong, and decides to change for the better, only then does he find peace with himself, and thus each other. True, they are fighting with each other, but their individual internal struggles are the true battle. The film is one big tense moment, only finally relaxing at the very end. S. jackson as always delivers an excellent performance. His character's behavior was very similar to that character he played in Die Hard 3. Something about him, when he wigs out, is just awesome. Personally, I don't normally like b. affleck. He did a great job in this film though, as if the part was written for him.So, basically, even though this movie was different than I expected, it was an excellent movie. If you are expecting the kind of Arnold or Bruce Willis action flick, then you'll be disapointed. You don't know what's comming next, and the tension in the movie is thick enough to cut with a knife. How far would you go in the same situation? Personally, I thought the ending was perfect.

In REGARDING HENRY, a lawfirm wins a lawsuit on behalf of a hospital, but after a brain injury, Harrison Ford (playing an attorney) has second thoughts, and takes action to have the decision reversed.The second concurrent theme in CHANGING LANES is a divorce where the wife takes custody of her 2 children and plans to move across the country with them to Oregon, leaving the ex-husband bereft and on the verge of complete despair.  We have seen films showing divorces involving families with children, for example, KRAMER v. KRAMER, and so on.  I also was glad to see actress Kim Staunton in the role of the ex-wife.  I was glad because she looks like a real, typical member of the human race (she does not resemble Hollywood's usual version of how a black, adult woman should look like).The third concurrent theme is unique.  The third theme takes the form of a cat-and-mouse game, where Ben Affleck attempts to acquire a legal document that he'd accidently lost, and that had been picked up and toted around by a common insurance man played by Samuel L. Jackson.  On a few occasions, Ben Affleck is about to recover his document (but doesn't recover it).  On a couple of occasions Samuel L. Jackson is about to voluntarily transfer the document to Ben Affleck (but doesn't transfer it), and on a couple of occasions, he discards the document (but he recovers it from the trash).  But each time, fate gets in the way.  The result is a continuing series of setbacks for Mr.Affleck.  Samuel Jackson plays a man who is a decent fellow who, unfortunately, allows commonplace stresses to get the best of him.  He gets into a fistfight in a tavern.  He smashes a computer in a bank.  He sabotages Mr.Affleck's automobile resulting in a wheel falling off on the freeway.  He causes a disruption in his childrens' school in his attempt to get near his children, after the divorce.  CHANGING LANES is brilliant for its subtle depiction of the characters played by Mr.Affleck and Mr.Jackson.  Neither character is depicted entirely as a good guy or as a bad guy.  The characters are fraught with ambiguity.  The only thing that holds steady in this movie is Mr.Jackson's love for his children, and hope that the ex-wife does not re-locate them in Oregon.P.S.  The movie has a happy ending.",5,"Finally, a thriller taking place in New York City with no guns and no shooting.",1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,2939,"['CHANGING', 'LANES', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'contemporary', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Already', 'location', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'movie', 'won', 'favor', 'tend', 'like', 'movies', 'taking', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'example', 'AS', 'GOOD', 'IT', 'GETS', 'KING', 'KONG', '2005', '13', 'GOING', 'ON', '30', 'TOWN', 'APARTMENT', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', '.The', 'movie', 'three', 'concurrent', 'themes', 'First', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'bright', 'young', 'attorney', 'partner', 'law', 'firm', 'However', 'second', 'thoughts', 'regarding', 'ethics', 'winning', 'lawsuit', 'charitable', 'foundation', 'have', 'seen', 'ethical', 'dilemma', 'example', 'REGARDING', 'HENRY', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'REGARDING', 'HENRY', 'lawfirm', 'lawsuit', 'behalf', 'hospital', 'brain', 'injury', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'playing', 'attorney', 'second', 'thoughts', 'action', 'have', 'decision', 'second', 'concurrent', 'theme', 'CHANGING', 'LANES', 'divorce', 'where', 'wife', 'custody', '2', 'children', 'plans', 'move', 'country', 'Oregon', 'leaving', 'ex-husband', 'bereft', 'verge', 'complete', 'despair', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'showing', 'divorces', 'involving', 'families', 'children', 'example', 'KRAMER', 'v.', 'KRAMER', 'so', 'also', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'actress', 'Kim', 'Staunton', 'role', 'ex-wife', 'was', 'glad', 'real', 'typical', 'member', 'human', 'race', 'not', 'resemble', 'Hollywood', 'usual', 'version', 'how', 'black', 'adult', 'woman', 'should', 'look', '.The', 'third', 'concurrent', 'theme', 'unique', 'third', 'theme', 'form', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'where', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'acquire', 'legal', 'document', ""'d"", 'accidently', 'lost', 'had', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'toted', 'common', 'insurance', 'man', 'played', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'few', 'occasions', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'recover', 'document', ""n't"", 'recover', 'couple', 'occasions', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'voluntarily', 'transfer', 'document', 'Ben', 'Affleck', ""n't"", 'transfer', 'couple', 'occasions', 'document', 'trash', 'time', 'fate', 'way', 'result', 'continuing', 'series', 'setbacks', 'Mr.Affleck', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'man', 'who', 'decent', 'fellow', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'commonplace', 'stresses', 'get', 'best', 'fistfight', 'tavern', 'computer', 'bank', 'Mr.Affleck', 'automobile', 'resulting', 'wheel', 'falling', 'off', 'freeway', 'disruption', 'childrens', 'school', 'attempt', 'get', 'children', 'divorce', 'CHANGING', 'LANES', 'brilliant', 'subtle', 'depiction', 'characters', 'played', 'Mr.Affleck', 'Mr.Jackson', 'character', 'depicted', 'entirely', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'characters', 'are', 'fraught', 'ambiguity', 'only', 'thing', 'steady', 'movie', 'Mr.Jackson', 'love', 'children', 'hope', 'ex-wife', 'not', 're-locate', 'Oregon.P.S', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending']",N/A

There was such an evident layer of meaning behind all the twists and turns that the characters went through that it just intrigued me beyond any point that I thought I would be.The directing was fantastic.

I have never seen a movie utilize the music better.Affleck and Jackson both give tremendous performances.  Affleck especially, which I eluded to earlier.  He made you care for his character, which really you wanted to hate him.  I think he actually did have morals, and if he just slowed down a little bit in life, he would be able to use them.

Starring Ben Affleck(who plays a hotshot lawyer and whose long chin and bad acting always get on my nerves) and Samuel Jackson( who plays divorced father of two). Ben is supposed to be in court and so is Samuel. They get in the traffic accident and when Ben wants to just give Samuel a check because he is in a hurry, Samuel wouldn't take it because he wants everything to be ""just right""(whatever the hell that means). Ben decides the hell with this and leaves. Samuel is late for court and because it was for a custody hearing, judge awards custody to his wife. He is royally pissed. Then, we go back to Ben who realizes he left an important document in Samuel car. Okay, Ben is pissed too. He tries to track down the other guy who promptly tells Ben to go to hell. Shortly thereafter he realizes that there is some fun to be had at Ben's expense and sends him a fax(although how he gets Ben's number is not explained) indicating he has the document and is not giving it back. Ben, who is pissed beyond belief decides to have some revenge and hires a hacker to screw Samuel's credit history. Next step, Samuel unscrews the wheel of Ben's car making a serious car accident a sure thing. Ben has the stage at this point and he threatens Samuel's kids. And so it goes. Oh, somewhere in the middle, Ben discovers that his boss(who is also his father-law) is a crook and he has to do some serious soul searching which almost made me lose my lunch(it was that painful to watch).

595736,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B00005JL5F,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[1, 2]","A gem of a movie hiding there in the shelves. After seeing the movie I truly could not understand why this movie did not make a splash. I never even heard of it until I saw it at the rentals. The movie basically has Ben Affleck playing a hotshot lawyer who on his way to a very important court case has a small accident with Samuel L Jackson who was on his way to the court as well to appear for his child custody case. Ben offers a blank check to Samuel citing he has to be some place and thus does not have the time to check and share insurance information. When Samuel does not accept the blank check and says he wants to do this the right way, Ben  leaves the scene leaving Sam stranded without a ride. Samuel cries out to Ben for a ride and not to leave him there stranded. Ben disregards this and is off. Back at the court, Ben realises when he is arguing the case, that he can't produce a very important document (a power of appointment) given by a deceased client of the firm which gave Ben's law firm the power to be trustees and caretaker of the money left behind by the deceased guy. He realises he must have dropped it at the accident site  (which Sam has picked up as good samaritan despite the harsh treatment he was given by Ben Affleck). Sam, due to the accident delay and due to not getting a timely ride to the court reaches late and as a result looses his right to say his piece before the judge and looses custody of the children. Ben then tries to get the power of appointment from Samuel. Being enraged on Ben for stranding him and thereby making him loose his childeren's custody, he refuses to return the document that Ben needs. Ben then uses the services of a guy who does network hacking jobs and gets Samuel's credit turned off. Sam thus gets refused a loan which he needed desperately to buy a house with, to persuade his estranged wife to live with him so he can be close to the childeren. Samuel now gets further enraged and then makes it a mission to make life tough for Ben. Samuel tears up certain parts of power of appointment, threatens to destroy the book if the credit is not turned on. Ben tries to get it turned back but the hacker guy is not able to reverse it, Samuel is further enraged and sabotages Ben's car by loosening the wheels. Ben nearly gets killed. This draws a response from Ben. Ben then calls Samuel Saying his boys have been kidnapped while informing the School that an unstable man will try to run away with this childern. A Distraught Samuel goes to the School in concern for his children which is misread by the School as a father who is trying to kidnap his children. So right from the accident, it's a case of Ben and Sam one-upping each other and trying to view the other with harmful intent and each end up doing things that they would otherwise normally not do. It basically showcases the depths to which a normal noble law abiding logical person can sink to and how easily in a second he can chose to give up the very moral fibre by which he lived his life all along and how this can be brought about by a single seemingly unimportant incident which can have meaningful negative consequences for a person. This is a film about the fine line that we tread between leading our lives with the moral code or making an exception and sometimes doing the immoral thing. I believe each of us who see this movie can relate to this movie because  no one can claim to be saint. We all in our past, be it small instances and incidences, have made some choices which we saw as right and just and correct in the heat of the moment but when the spite and anger over the situation passes we find ourselves questioning our very own actions which we thought were justifiable and correct beyond a shadow of doubt at an earlier point in time.regards, Vikram",5,A film about the fine line that we tread between leading our lives with the moral code and the rejection of this code at times.,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,3803,"['gem', 'movie', 'hiding', 'there', 'shelves', 'seeing', 'movie', 'truly', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'splash', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'saw', 'rentals', 'movie', 'basically', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'playing', 'hotshot', 'lawyer', 'who', 'way', 'very', 'important', 'court', 'case', 'small', 'accident', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'who', 'was', 'way', 'court', 'as', 'well', 'appear', 'child', 'custody', 'case', 'Ben', 'blank', 'check', 'Samuel', 'citing', 'be', 'place', 'thus', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'check', 'share', 'insurance', 'information', 'When', 'Samuel', 'not', 'accept', 'blank', 'check', 'do', 'right', 'way', 'Ben', 'scene', 'leaving', 'Sam', 'stranded', 'ride', 'Samuel', 'out', 'Ben', 'ride', 'not', 'leave', 'there', 'stranded', 'Ben', 'off', 'Back', 'court', 'Ben', 'when', 'arguing', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'produce', 'very', 'important', 'document', 'power', 'appointment', 'given', 'deceased', 'client', 'firm', 'gave', 'Ben', 'law', 'firm', 'power', 'be', 'trustees', 'caretaker', 'money', 'left', 'behind', 'deceased', 'guy', 'must', 'have', 'dropped', 'accident', 'site', 'Sam', 'picked', 'up', 'as', 'good', 'samaritan', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'was', 'given', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Sam', 'due', 'accident', 'delay', 'due', 'not', 'getting', 'timely', 'ride', 'court', 'late', 'result', 'right', 'say', 'piece', 'judge', 'custody', 'children', 'Ben', 'then', 'get', 'power', 'appointment', 'Samuel', 'Being', 'enraged', 'Ben', 'stranding', 'thereby', 'making', 'loose', 'childeren', 'custody', 'return', 'document', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'then', 'services', 'guy', 'who', 'network', 'hacking', 'jobs', 'Samuel', 'credit', 'turned', 'off', 'Sam', 'thus', 'refused', 'loan', 'needed', 'desperately', 'buy', 'house', 'persuade', 'estranged', 'wife', 'live', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'close', 'childeren', 'Samuel', 'now', 'further', 'enraged', 'then', 'mission', 'make', 'life', 'tough', 'Ben', 'Samuel', 'up', 'certain', 'parts', 'power', 'appointment', 'destroy', 'book', 'credit', 'not', 'turned', 'Ben', 'get', 'turned', 'back', 'hacker', 'guy', 'not', 'able', 'reverse', 'Samuel', 'further', 'enraged', 'Ben', 'car', 'loosening', 'wheels', 'Ben', 'nearly', 'killed', 'response', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'then', 'Samuel', 'Saying', 'boys', 'have', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'informing', 'School', 'unstable', 'man', 'will', 'try', 'run', 'away', 'childern', 'Distraught', 'Samuel', 'School', 'concern', 'children', 'misread', 'School', 'father', 'who', 'trying', 'kidnap', 'children', 'So', 'right', 'accident', 'case', 'Ben', 'Sam', 'one-upping', 'other', 'trying', 'view', 'other', 'harmful', 'intent', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'things', 'would', 'otherwise', 'normally', 'not', 'do', 'basically', 'depths', 'normal', 'noble', 'law', 'abiding', 'logical', 'person', 'can', 'sink', 'how', 'easily', 'second', 'can', 'chose', 'give', 'up', 'very', 'moral', 'fibre', 'lived', 'life', 'along', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'about', 'single', 'seemingly', 'unimportant', 'incident', 'can', 'have', 'meaningful', 'negative', 'consequences', 'person', 'film', 'fine', 'line', 'tread', 'leading', 'lives', 'moral', 'code', 'making', 'exception', 'sometimes', 'doing', 'immoral', 'thing', 'believe', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'relate', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'claim', 'be', 'saint', 'past', 'be', 'small', 'instances', 'incidences', 'have', 'made', 'choices', 'saw', 'right', 'just', 'correct', 'heat', 'moment', 'when', 'spite', 'anger', 'situation', 'find', 'questioning', 'very', 'own', 'actions', 'thought', 'were', 'justifiable', 'correct', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'earlier', 'point', 'time.regards', 'Vikram']",N/A

595738,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00005JL5F,wellwellwell,"[0, 0]","After watching this movie and 'The Sum Of All Fears', both of which came out and the same time, I think it's safe to say this is the better of the two.  In this sometimes subtle thriller, Ben Affleck stars with Samuel L. Jackson.  Affleck plays the part of a big-shot attorney whose supposed-to-be-pro-bono job takes a turn for the worst when he loses a red folder after an accident on the freeway.  He'd met Doyle Gibson during that accident, and in turn he has the folder.  This then starts an awesome brawl between the two men, who are both seeking successful revenge to make up for the [bad] days they'd each had.  And as the battle between them picks up, so does the movie.I find it disappointing that Affleck and Jackson had never, before 'Changing Lanes', been in a movie together.  They work so well as enemies that you're never able to chose a side; or pick a favorite.  Both characters do things they'd probably never do, but in the cases they're in, they have no choice.  And throughout the movie, you'll keep wondering to yourself why he doesn't just give the folder back.  But remember, if he did that, there would be no movie.As far as a supporting cast, there's not much.  The appearance by Amanda Peet ('The Whole Nine Yards' and 'Whipped') is good, yet minimal.  But to be honest, the film doesn't need much support.  It's very strong on its own; Affleck and Jackson really mold the movie into an original piece of work.  And defining this movie in a genre is difficult.  It's not a comedy, nor is it a true action film.  In the end it's just a thriller; and a great one at that.  I gave this movie only 4 stars, and not 5, because of its (lack of) supporting cast.  As I said, the film is still very strong without it, but it would have been nice to see some more familiar faces.

Just trying to do right, get with his wife, be a good father and Bam!  But I'm not too worried, after all he's a jedi. This was by far the best acting by Ben Affleck I've seen in a while.One of the things I loved about 'Lanes' was once you thought you've found the lowest common denominator, forget it, someone will go even lower. These guy go beyond killing they move in on each others families. And I love his boss trying to rationalize what he does as ""more good"" It was almost the only laugh in an otherwise serious movie.The two leads punch and claw their way through a terrible day and the movie ends with a surprising if not satisfying conclusion.

""Changing Lanes"" is a drama about greed tugging at the soul of society and how one young man responds, producing another feel good movie of sorts by the film's finale.Ben Affleck is a ""What Makes Sammy Run?"" style lawyer from New York who at the tender age of 29 has already made it to partner level in the highly successful firm run by his father-in-law, played by prominent director and talented character actor Sydney Pollack.  On his way to court and an important probate hearing for control of the foundation previously headed by a now deceased, wealthy entrepreneur-philanthropist, the young man in a hurry becomes involved in a fender bender with Samuel L. Jackson.The fender bender has a major impact on both drivers.  Jackson, an insurance salesman fighting a battle against alcohol addiction, misses a crucial custody hearing involving his wife and children.  His wife is slated to move to Oregon and seeks to take Jackson's children with her while, through great effort, he has managed to string together a deal for a fixer-upper house, hoping this will keep her in New York and prompt her to drop her divorce action against him.  The accident makes him late for the hearing as full custody is granted to his wife.  He does not get to make his case.Affleck suffers in a different way.  In the mixup following the accident Affleck leaves behind the all-important file containing the signature of the dying philanthropist granting the law firm for which the young lawyer works total control of the foundation's money.  This crucial document ends up in Jackson's hands.When Affleck through happenstance manages to see Jackson on the street and seeks help, the angry insurance salesman lets him know what he thinks of his discourtesy and indifference to his plight, reminding him that he fled the scene of the accident.  When Affleck plays hardball and has Jackson's credit ruined through employing a skilled Internet hacker, his tough adversary fights back on his own terms.After the action has escalated to an accelerated level the two adversaries develop a respect for each other and begin to recognize that in such a situation an ethical solution is the best course for both of them.Affleck grows up in a hurry, facing the blunt truth that in securing the signature of a dying man no longer in control of his faculties he has engaged in fraud on behalf of the firm.  When he expresses his misgivings to Pollack, he is bluntly told to wise up and do his job.  Pollack states that the philanthropist used some shady methods to acquire his fortune, and that is the way the game is played in the corporate and professional big leagues, in a take no prisoners manner with moral qualms left behind.  To do less is to lose the race.At the film's end Affleck is a changed man who is able to turn the tables on Pollack in a clever manner.  He will no longer be a hired gun who abandons ethical considerations in the pursuit of more money and fame.",5,A Film With a Positive Message,1034726400,"10 16, 2002",2002,3185,"['Director', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'scored', 'big', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'love', 'unlikely', 'pairing', 'film', 'superstar', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'impoverished', 'book', 'store', 'proprietor', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'resulted', 'gloriously', 'unselfish', 'love', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'drama', 'greed', 'tugging', 'soul', 'society', 'how', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'producing', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'sorts', 'film', 'finale.Ben', 'Affleck', 'What', 'Makes', 'Sammy', 'Run', 'style', 'lawyer', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'tender', 'age', '29', 'already', 'made', 'partner', 'level', 'highly', 'successful', 'firm', 'run', 'father-in-law', 'played', 'prominent', 'director', 'talented', 'character', 'actor', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'way', 'court', 'important', 'probate', 'hearing', 'control', 'foundation', 'previously', 'headed', 'now', 'deceased', 'wealthy', 'entrepreneur-philanthropist', 'young', 'man', 'hurry', 'involved', 'fender', 'bender', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson.The', 'fender', 'bender', 'major', 'impact', 'drivers', 'Jackson', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'fighting', 'battle', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'crucial', 'custody', 'hearing', 'involving', 'wife', 'children', 'wife', 'slated', 'move', 'Oregon', 'take', 'Jackson', 'children', 'while', 'great', 'effort', 'managed', 'string', 'together', 'deal', 'fixer-upper', 'house', 'hoping', 'will', 'keep', 'New', 'York', 'prompt', 'drop', 'divorce', 'action', 'accident', 'late', 'hearing', 'full', 'custody', 'granted', 'wife', 'not', 'get', 'make', 'case.Affleck', 'suffers', 'different', 'way', 'mixup', 'following', 'accident', 'Affleck', 'all-important', 'file', 'containing', 'signature', 'dying', 'philanthropist', 'granting', 'law', 'firm', 'young', 'lawyer', 'total', 'control', 'foundation', 'money', 'crucial', 'document', 'up', 'Jackson', 'hands.When', 'Affleck', 'happenstance', 'manages', 'see', 'Jackson', 'street', 'help', 'angry', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'know', 'what', 'discourtesy', 'indifference', 'plight', 'reminding', 'fled', 'scene', 'accident', 'When', 'Affleck', 'hardball', 'Jackson', 'credit', 'ruined', 'employing', 'skilled', 'Internet', 'hacker', 'tough', 'adversary', 'fights', 'back', 'own', 'terms.After', 'action', 'escalated', 'accelerated', 'level', 'two', 'adversaries', 'develop', 'respect', 'other', 'begin', 'recognize', 'such', 'situation', 'ethical', 'solution', 'best', 'course', 'them.Affleck', 'up', 'hurry', 'facing', 'blunt', 'truth', 'securing', 'signature', 'dying', 'man', 'no', 'longer', 'control', 'faculties', 'engaged', 'fraud', 'behalf', 'firm', 'When', 'misgivings', 'Pollack', 'bluntly', 'told', 'wise', 'up', 'do', 'job', 'Pollack', 'states', 'philanthropist', 'used', 'shady', 'methods', 'acquire', 'fortune', 'way', 'game', 'played', 'corporate', 'professional', 'big', 'leagues', 'take', 'prisoners', 'manner', 'moral', 'qualms', 'left', 'behind', 'do', 'less', 'lose', 'race.At', 'film', 'end', 'Affleck', 'changed', 'man', 'who', 'able', 'turn', 'tables', 'Pollack', 'clever', 'manner', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'hired', 'gun', 'who', 'ethical', 'considerations', 'pursuit', 'more', 'money', 'fame']",N/A

The collison changes their lives, but they don't realise straight away.  Without giving too much away, Changing Lanes is a film that also questions people's general behaviour. Aside from all this, the film is rather predictable and gets a bit dry in the second half.  Toni Collette stars as a trusted colleague to Ben Affleck and is the main reason I watched the film - she's a great actress.  The film suffers from a happy Hollywood ending which is a shame because it's unlikely that such a situation would have a happy ending in real life. A film that is not worth buying in my opinion.

Samuel Jackson and Ben Affleck give excellent performances, expected from Jackson and one of Affleck's better outings.Changing Lanes is not the hyper charged action revenge flick the trailer made it out to be. Instead it is a thoughtful look at two flawed characters that devolve through most of the film until they meet their base personality and the responsibility of their actions.There is action and the plot moves quickly. Watching events unfold and splinter into lower forms of behavior is convincingly conveyed right until the last scene which is a Hollywood ending.Without giving away details it makes the decision that you as a viewer aren't smart enough to &quot;get&quot; the film and helps you along with the extra Hollywood oriented coda type ending.Worth seeing for 95% of the film.

Here we have two men from the opposite end of the humanities spectrum crashing into each other and uprooting their agendas, which are the basis of life to them at this time.As one breaks the covenant of how we treat ourselves and others and the consequences of breaking that covenant, then we ignite the hatred that lies just beneath the surface. And the vendettas are our only means to get even.This was a good and interesting premise But the ending was like all of Hollywood movie endings. And, excuse me, but, how do we get from all the hate these two men have for each other, their evil deeds they let-loose on each other...how can you sum it up in the end that Roger Mitchell give us and walk away feeling like you just saw something great or something the director, (in the end felt guilty about) and says, "" oh erase the first part and lets fade to"" it was all a mistake.Don't get me wrong the movie is worth seeing. Samuel L. Jackson (Doyle) gives a great performance as does Kim Staunton, (his wife Valerie) she gives a stunning tirade on why she and the kids are leaving, him,(Doyle) She tells him that he is hung-up, not on booze, but, on chaos, and chaos follows him and touches everyone around him. His mentor in AA( William Hurt) tells him the same thing.Ben Affleck(Gavin) is the well-to-do-lawyer who actually breaks the covenant of a mans bond to another man, by leaving Doyle at the scene of the accident with the words""better luck next time"". Both men are due in court,Gavin to file papers for a trust foundation (legality in question) and Doyle for a hearing to have visiting rights of his two sons.l You are going to have to wrestle with the ending in your own way.ciao yaaah69",4,CHANGING LANES= A FREEWAY IN THE END!!,1018569600,"04 12, 2002",2002,1788,"[""'Changing"", 'Lanes', 'makings', 'great', 'film', 'kept', 'interested', 'most', 'way', 'Here', 'have', 'two', 'men', 'opposite', 'end', 'humanities', 'spectrum', 'crashing', 'other', 'uprooting', 'agendas', 'are', 'basis', 'life', 'time.As', 'one', 'covenant', 'how', 'treat', 'ourselves', 'others', 'consequences', 'breaking', 'covenant', 'then', 'ignite', 'hatred', 'just', 'beneath', 'surface', 'vendettas', 'are', 'only', 'get', 'even.This', 'was', 'good', 'interesting', 'premise', 'ending', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'endings', 'excuse', 'how', 'do', 'get', 'hate', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'other', 'evil', 'deeds', 'let-loose', 'other', 'how', 'can', 'sum', 'up', 'end', 'Roger', 'Mitchell', 'give', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'just', 'saw', 'something', 'great', 'something', 'director', 'end', 'felt', 'guilty', 'oh', 'erase', 'first', 'part', 'fade', 'was', 'mistake.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Doyle', 'great', 'performance', 'Kim', 'Staunton', 'wife', 'Valerie', 'stunning', 'tirade', 'why', 'kids', 'are', 'leaving', 'Doyle', 'hung-up', 'not', 'booze', 'chaos', 'chaos', 'touches', 'everyone', 'mentor', 'AA', 'William', 'Hurt', 'same', 'thing.Ben', 'Affleck', 'Gavin', 'well-to-do-lawyer', 'who', 'actually', 'covenant', 'mans', 'bond', 'man', 'leaving', 'Doyle', 'scene', 'accident', 'words', 'better', 'luck', 'next', 'time', 'men', 'are', 'due', 'court', 'Gavin', 'file', 'papers', 'trust', 'foundation', 'legality', 'question', 'Doyle', 'hearing', 'have', 'visiting', 'rights', 'two', 'sons.l', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'wrestle', 'ending', 'own', 'way.ciao', 'yaaah69']",N/A
