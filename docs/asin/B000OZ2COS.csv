1067581,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000OZ2COS,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Our Very Own was sort of boring and hard to understand.  It wasn't just the point of the main storyline that was hard to understand, but initially very difficult to understand who all the teenage kids hanging out together were supposed to be.  At first I thought they were brothers and sisters and was completely shocked how well behaved they were and how well they got along, but soon some of them start kissing each other so I realize they're friends instead.Occasionally some minor problems occur (emphasis on ""minor"") such as the one boys father having a drinking problem and would attempt arguing with his wife around their son, and then eventually the drinking turned into the potential loss of a house that resulted in sadness and concern by the mother and teenage son.  Unfortunately there's no atmosphere to speak of- almost *never* in fact, so it was hard as a viewer to really sink myself into the storyline and feel sympathy or concern for the characters.Well another aspect is that there's supposed to be a special celebrity woman visiting this small southern town, and the one girl (of the friends) really admired her moreso than the other friends and she was determined to visit her.  Again though, the storyline was so boring that it was hard to care about any of this.I guess the movie took place in the 70's given the constant disco music being played and the stereo equipment in the teens bedrooms, and the general feeling and quiet tone of the characters and the dreary secluded setting felt very 70'-ish, but I don't believe it was ever specifically said what year it took place.Sometimes these bullies would cause *very* minor trouble with the group of friends and criticize them, but it was never very serious or anything.  Well I guess it gets serious later on but still, it's not compelling enough for a TV drama.Overall... well a bunch of nothingness happens concerning a group of friends.  It's not a bad movie- just a boring one.",3,somewhat boring,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,1957,"['Very', 'Own', 'was', 'sort', 'boring', 'hard', 'understand', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'point', 'main', 'storyline', 'was', 'hard', 'understand', 'initially', 'very', 'difficult', 'understand', 'who', 'teenage', 'kids', 'hanging', 'out', 'together', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'first', 'thought', 'were', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'was', 'completely', 'shocked', 'how', 'well', 'behaved', 'were', 'how', 'well', 'got', 'along', 'soon', 'start', 'kissing', 'other', 'so', 'realize', ""'re"", 'friends', 'instead.Occasionally', 'minor', 'problems', 'occur', 'emphasis', 'minor', 'such', 'one', 'father', 'having', 'drinking', 'problem', 'would', 'attempt', 'arguing', 'wife', 'son', 'then', 'eventually', 'drinking', 'turned', 'potential', 'loss', 'house', 'resulted', 'sadness', 'concern', 'mother', 'teenage', 'son', 'Unfortunately', 'atmosphere', 'speak', 'of-', 'almost', '*never*', 'fact', 'was', 'hard', 'viewer', 'really', 'sink', 'storyline', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'concern', 'characters.Well', 'aspect', 'supposed', 'be', 'special', 'celebrity', 'woman', 'visiting', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'one', 'girl', 'friends', 'really', 'admired', 'moreso', 'other', 'friends', 'was', 'determined', 'visit', 'Again', 'storyline', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'was', 'hard', 'care', 'this.I', 'guess', 'movie', 'took', 'place', '70', 'given', 'constant', 'disco', 'music', 'being', 'played', 'stereo', 'equipment', 'teens', 'bedrooms', 'general', 'feeling', 'quiet', 'tone', 'characters', 'dreary', 'secluded', 'setting', 'felt', 'very', ""70'-ish"", 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'ever', 'specifically', 'said', 'what', 'year', 'took', 'place.Sometimes', 'bullies', 'would', 'cause', '*very*', 'minor', 'trouble', 'group', 'friends', 'criticize', 'was', 'never', 'very', 'serious', 'anything', 'Well', 'guess', 'serious', 'later', 'still', 'not', 'compelling', 'enough', 'TV', 'drama.Overall', 'well', 'bunch', 'nothingness', 'happens', 'concerning', 'group', 'friends', 'not', 'bad', 'movie-', 'just', 'boring', 'one']",Our Very Own

1067584,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000OZ2COS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 11]","I can see where ""American Graffiti"" is an obvious point of cinematic reference for ""Our Very Own,"" but while this 2005 film has the charm and sense of nostalgia that defined George Lucas's film, it does not have the same feeling of weight.  But that is going to happen when one film has a character who will end up being reported MIA in Vietnam and the other has a character who is hoping to see the actress Sondra Locke.  Still, first time writer-director-producer Cameron Watson, an actor who might be most recognizable for his role of Rick in the 2-part ""The Other Side of Life"" on ""Grey's Anatomy"" last season, has put together a nice little film about Shelbyville, Tennessee, where he went to high school.  Watson was born in Lexington, Kentucky, but Sondra Locke was born and raised in Shelbyville (valedictorian of the class of 1962), which explains why the whole town gets excitedSondra Locke was pretty much at the peak of her career back in 1978, which explains why everybody is excited about her new movie that year, ""Every Which Way but Loose"" came out.  The previous two years Locke had starred in ""The Gauntlet"" and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" so on the one hand you have to wonder why nobody is wondering if Clint Eastwood is going to show up, but on the other if you know how their 12-year romance ended you can understand why his name would be taboo in this film.  But all that matters is that as far as Shelbyville is concerned they are all excited that their very own favorite daughter is coming home to kick off the annual walking horse competition for which the city is best known.Ostensibly this film focuses on a group of young friends trying to figure out the rest of their lives.  Melora Kendall (Autumn Reeser) is the one who is giddy with the thought of meeting Locke, while Bobbie Chester (Hilarie Burton) just wants to borrow the car from her momma (Beth Grant) and check out the nightlife in Nashville.  The two girls hang out with a trio of guys.  Glen (Michael McKee) is not quite out of the closet, Ray (Derek Carter) who does not have much to say, and Clancy Whitfield (Jason Ritter), whose family life is about to implode.  His father Billy (Keith Carradine) has been drinking more and more since he lost his job and now his mother Joan (Allison Janney) is finding her dinning room furniture is being repossessed and is worried about losing the family home.  So while the kids are in the forefront of this movie, is what it happening with Clancy's family that our attention gravitates towards, especially given Janney's performance.Much is made by the fact that Watson got Mary Badham (Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"") to do her first film in almost 40 years to play Mrs. Nutbush, but the more impressive testament to this film is that his script got Janney to play Clancy's mother.  Janney is 6 feet tall, but Carradine is an inch taller and that matters in this film as Billy makes his wife look small.  Joan knows that the train wreck her life is fast becoming will be grist for the town's gossip mill and she is trying to retain her dignity.  At least Joan's best friend, Sally Crowder (Cheryl Hines) is a true friend and can help lessen the indignities that Billy is heaping on her.  Playing C.J. Cregg on ""The West Wing"" earned Janney four Emmy Awards, but she has had trouble finding movie roles worthy of her talents (""American Beauty"" being the exception proving the rule in this case).  Joan Whitfield is a supporting role in the film in the dynamic of this film, but you are drawn to Janney in virtually every scene in which she appears.The time frame of this movie precludes much happening in terms of resolution to the Whitfield family problems, let alone Clancy's budding romance with Melora, Melora's quest to become an actress, or most of the other pressing concerns of these young folks that week in Shelbyville.  But if Bobbie can just get Ricky Pranger (John Will Clay) out of her hair, that would put these kids ahead of the game.  ""Our Very Own"" is a small film that celebrates small moments, and the key moments in this film are the simplest of beginnings.  Beyond Janney's performance, the most impressive thing about this film is how the people of Shelbyville supported what Watson was doing.  You look at the end credits of this film and you have to wonder if there actually are any businesses in town that do not get mentioned.  This is not a product of Hollywood; it is a hometown movie if every I have seen one.",4,"Cameron Watson's hometown movie about Shelbyville, Tenneessee in 1978",1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,4473,"['can', 'see', 'where', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'obvious', 'point', 'cinematic', 'reference', 'Very', 'Own', '2005', 'film', 'charm', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'defined', 'George', 'Lucas', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'feeling', 'weight', 'going', 'happen', 'when', 'one', 'film', 'character', 'who', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'reported', 'MIA', 'Vietnam', 'other', 'character', 'who', 'hoping', 'see', 'actress', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'Still', 'first', 'time', 'writer-director-producer', 'Cameron', 'Watson', 'actor', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'recognizable', 'role', 'Rick', '2-part', 'Other', 'Side', 'Life', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'last', 'season', 'put', 'together', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'Shelbyville', 'Tennessee', 'where', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'Watson', 'was', 'born', 'Lexington', 'Kentucky', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Shelbyville', 'valedictorian', 'class', '1962', 'why', 'whole', 'town', 'excitedSondra', 'Locke', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'peak', 'career', 'back', '1978', 'why', 'everybody', 'excited', 'new', 'movie', 'year', 'Which', 'Way', 'Loose', 'came', 'out', 'previous', 'two', 'years', 'Locke', 'had', 'starred', 'Gauntlet', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'so', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'nobody', 'wondering', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'going', 'show', 'up', 'other', 'know', 'how', '12-year', 'romance', 'ended', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'name', 'would', 'be', 'taboo', 'film', 'matters', 'as', 'far', 'Shelbyville', 'concerned', 'are', 'excited', 'very', 'own', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'coming', 'home', 'kick', 'off', 'annual', 'walking', 'horse', 'competition', 'city', 'best', 'known.Ostensibly', 'film', 'group', 'young', 'friends', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'rest', 'lives', 'Melora', 'Kendall', 'Autumn', 'Reeser', 'one', 'who', 'giddy', 'thought', 'meeting', 'Locke', 'Bobbie', 'Chester', 'Hilarie', 'Burton', 'just', 'borrow', 'car', 'momma', 'Beth', 'Grant', 'check', 'out', 'nightlife', 'Nashville', 'two', 'girls', 'hang', 'out', 'trio', 'guys', 'Glen', 'Michael', 'McKee', 'not', 'quite', 'closet', 'Ray', 'Derek', 'Carter', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'say', 'Clancy', 'Whitfield', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'family', 'life', 'implode', 'father', 'Billy', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'been', 'drinking', 'more', 'more', 'lost', 'job', 'now', 'mother', 'Joan', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'finding', 'dinning', 'room', 'furniture', 'being', 'repossessed', 'worried', 'losing', 'family', 'home', 'So', 'kids', 'are', 'forefront', 'movie', 'what', 'happening', 'Clancy', 'family', 'attention', 'towards', 'especially', 'given', 'Janney', 'performance.Much', 'made', 'fact', 'Watson', 'got', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'Scout', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'do', 'first', 'film', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'play', 'Mrs.', 'Nutbush', 'more', 'impressive', 'testament', 'film', 'script', 'got', 'Janney', 'play', 'Clancy', 'mother', 'Janney', '6', 'feet', 'tall', 'Carradine', 'inch', 'taller', 'matters', 'film', 'Billy', 'wife', 'look', 'small', 'Joan', 'train', 'wreck', 'life', 'fast', 'becoming', 'will', 'be', 'grist', 'town', 'gossip', 'mill', 'trying', 'retain', 'dignity', 'least', 'Joan', 'best', 'friend', 'Sally', 'Crowder', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'true', 'friend', 'can', 'help', 'lessen', 'indignities', 'Billy', 'heaping', 'Playing', 'C.J', 'Cregg', 'West', 'Wing', 'earned', 'Janney', 'four', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'movie', 'roles', 'worthy', 'talents', 'American', 'Beauty', 'being', 'exception', 'proving', 'rule', 'case', 'Joan', 'Whitfield', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'dynamic', 'film', 'are', 'drawn', 'Janney', 'virtually', 'scene', 'appears.The', 'time', 'frame', 'movie', 'much', 'happening', 'terms', 'resolution', 'Whitfield', 'family', 'problems', 'let', 'alone', 'Clancy', 'budding', 'romance', 'Melora', 'Melora', 'quest', 'become', 'actress', 'most', 'other', 'pressing', 'concerns', 'young', 'folks', 'week', 'Shelbyville', 'Bobbie', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'Ricky', 'Pranger', 'John', 'Will', 'Clay', 'hair', 'would', 'put', 'kids', 'ahead', 'game', 'Very', 'Own', 'small', 'film', 'small', 'moments', 'key', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'simplest', 'beginnings', 'Beyond', 'Janney', 'performance', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'film', 'how', 'people', 'Shelbyville', 'supported', 'what', 'Watson', 'was', 'doing', 'look', 'end', 'credits', 'film', 'have', 'wonder', 'actually', 'are', 'businesses', 'town', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'mentioned', 'not', 'product', 'Hollywood', 'hometown', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'one']",Our Very Own
