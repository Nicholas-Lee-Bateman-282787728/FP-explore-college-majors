First I'll mention that my wife also gave it three stars although the rating here is strictly my doing.Importantly it was good enough that we wanted to finish it instead of stopping it at some point before the ending; that's saying something in its favor. As a music lover I'll admit the theme music is hauntingly beautiful and often finds its way into my thoughts; this sort of gets things off to a good start. The story as presented was not hard to follow and had some very dramatic and provocative scenes. I'll not repeat the story here but will simply say it made sufficient sense for me to avoid frustration with the progress of the story.I always find English scenery interesting and the images presented as representing Suffolk held my attention. It seems like a rugged and unforgiving coastline along there as I'm much better acquainted with the softness, usually, of the Gulf Coast (hurricanes are an exception of course).My wife and I agree that the situation involving the Commander and Deborah was somewhat abrupt there near the ending and didn't seem to have a sufficient buildup to justify what happened. We also share the opinion the ending seemed much too contrived and was the biggest disappointment of all.By and large we shall probably not seek this one out to watch again although the first time around it was worth three stars.I suggest you view it before you buy it.",3,Beautiful Theme Music and an OK Story,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,1520,"['wife', 'more', 'P.D', 'James', 'fan', 'am', 'read', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'simply', 'address', 'impressions', 'DVD', 'First', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'wife', 'also', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'rating', 'here', 'strictly', 'doing.Importantly', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'wanted', 'finish', 'instead', 'stopping', 'point', 'ending', 'saying', 'something', 'favor', 'music', 'lover', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'theme', 'music', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'often', 'way', 'thoughts', 'sort', 'things', 'good', 'start', 'story', 'presented', 'was', 'not', 'hard', 'follow', 'had', 'very', 'dramatic', 'provocative', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'not', 'repeat', 'story', 'here', 'will', 'simply', 'say', 'made', 'sufficient', 'sense', 'avoid', 'frustration', 'progress', 'story.I', 'always', 'find', 'English', 'scenery', 'interesting', 'images', 'presented', 'representing', 'Suffolk', 'held', 'attention', 'rugged', 'unforgiving', 'coastline', 'along', 'there', ""'m"", 'much', 'better', 'acquainted', 'softness', 'usually', 'Gulf', 'Coast', 'hurricanes', 'are', 'exception', 'course', 'wife', 'agree', 'situation', 'involving', 'Commander', 'Deborah', 'was', 'somewhat', 'abrupt', 'there', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'sufficient', 'buildup', 'justify', 'what', 'happened', 'also', 'share', 'opinion', 'ending', 'seemed', 'much', 'too', 'contrived', 'was', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'all.By', 'large', 'shall', 'probably', 'not', 'seek', 'one', 'out', 'watch', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'worth', 'three', 'stars.I', 'suggest', 'view', 'buy']",N/A

This makes for dead end plot lines, incomprehensible scenes, comprehensible scenes which no longer advance the plot. Clearly if one tries to adapt a complex novel such as one by the later James one must cut to the bone or saw off all the branches of the tree leaving only the solid trunk. Nevertheless, seen without concern to how faithful the film is to the original book, it is an entertaining hour and forty minutes. This episode marks the emergence of the humane, decent Dalgleish as distinct from the almost pure copper we saw earlier on. There is a parallel between his relationship to his lady-love and the murder victims to those who loved him.

Roy Marsden falls flat as a romantic lead, Mel Martin bears little resemblance to the Deborah of the book, and there's no wonder sparks don't fly between them.

In this story we have a crime novelist who is found dead, his hands severed from his body.  The suspects have alibis; one (a slightly effete and decidedly obnoxious critic) is played by the superb Bill Nighy.  There are two subplots, one involving a sleazoid gangster, the second involving Dalgleish and his relationship with his girl friend.  As those subplots intersect, the girl friend is threatened. The climax is particularly memorable, with a storm at sea and Dalgleish trapped with a suspect in a seaside cottage through which the winds are howling and in which the water is rising.
