The cd was hilarious and only had one use of profanity, showing comedy can be funny and clean. ""I Say Nay Nay"" is John's first dvd, and the material is mostly different from the cd. There are a few similar stories, but not many. The only extra on the dvd is a 5 minute clip of a much younger John on TV doing the ""You Go Now"" bit from the cd. The only problem is John uses a lot more language in this one. I sat down with the kids to watch it because we all love his cd and I was a little shocked.

Both DVDs have pretty much the same material with a few twists. John Pinette is one funny guy but he is also a pretty good singer and he sings quite a bit in this DVD.If you think being overweight stops you from having fun, think again! John Pinette has hilarious stories about water skiing, parasailing, cruising, white water rafting, amusement parks and water parks. He is also very well traveled and his stories of London and Paris are quite humorous. He also does accents very well.What I like most about John Pinette's act is how his stories flow from one to the other quite seamlessly. Like he tells all his stories about standing in line all at once so they are even funnier.John Pinette has been on diets for over 20 years so he knows all about exercising, personal trainers, the gym and nutritionists. I'm currently on the Medifast diet so everything John Pinette says about dieting makes complete sense.So if you are trying to decide between ""I'm Stavin"" and ""I Say Nay Nay"" go with the latter.
