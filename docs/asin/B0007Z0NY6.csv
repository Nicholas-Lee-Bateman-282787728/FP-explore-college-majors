895659,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B0007Z0NY6,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[8, 10]","You know those cutesy pet commercials with talking animals that have the rather bad CGI moving mouths?  That's what I thought the kids and I were in for.-mistakenly, as it turned out.  What a pleasant surprise that Racing Stripes proved to be top family entertainment.Racing Stripes is about a zebra who was lost from a traveling circus as a foal, then rescued by a racehorse-trainer-turned-farmer and his daughter, Channing.  They raise him with their other barnyard animals, within clear sight of the thoroughbred farm next door.  Stripes grows up dreaming about becoming a race horse, much to the snickering delight of the farm.  But some of the other animals encourage him to go for his dreams, even dig up some surprisingly effective training skills to help him out.  Through a series of carefully planned manipulations, the barnyard conspires to get the humans to enter Stripes in the big race with Channing as his jockey.  The odds are against him, he is often ridiculed about his lack of size and funny appearance, but the plucky zebra proves in the end that taking risks for what's important to you is what makes you a winner.This movie plot is predictable and formulaic, standard ""talking animal"" fare - so what?  It's visuals are done seamlessly and beautifully.  The messages about working hard to achieve your goals, having a good attitude and not giving up when things get tough are very timely for this generation.  There is some guilty pleasure in the running gags which involve some potty humor, even for an adult (but I won't admit this to my husband!). I liked all the human actors as much as the charming animals; even the villainess is a personal favorite from her previous roles on television. Most importantly, it was a feel good story that the * kids* loved. Was it the sight of realistic-looking talking animals that enthralled them or the well-choreographed action?  Don't know, don't care because IT WORKED.Don't ever forget, kids can love movies and tv shows that drive you up the wall: but when it's entertaining to the adults as well, it's a real keeper.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",5,Entertaining and wholesome: what more could a parent want?,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2107,"['know', 'cutesy', 'pet', 'commercials', 'talking', 'animals', 'have', 'rather', 'bad', 'CGI', 'moving', 'mouths', 'what', 'thought', 'kids', 'were', 'for.-mistakenly', 'turned', 'out', 'What', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Racing', 'Stripes', 'proved', 'be', 'top', 'family', 'entertainment.Racing', 'Stripes', 'zebra', 'who', 'was', 'lost', 'traveling', 'circus', 'foal', 'then', 'rescued', 'racehorse-trainer-turned-farmer', 'daughter', 'Channing', 'raise', 'other', 'barnyard', 'animals', 'clear', 'sight', 'thoroughbred', 'farm', 'next', 'door', 'Stripes', 'up', 'dreaming', 'becoming', 'race', 'horse', 'much', 'snickering', 'delight', 'farm', 'other', 'animals', 'encourage', 'go', 'dreams', 'even', 'dig', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'training', 'skills', 'help', 'out', 'series', 'carefully', 'planned', 'manipulations', 'barnyard', 'get', 'humans', 'enter', 'Stripes', 'big', 'race', 'Channing', 'jockey', 'odds', 'are', 'often', 'ridiculed', 'lack', 'size', 'funny', 'appearance', 'plucky', 'zebra', 'proves', 'end', 'taking', 'risks', 'what', 'important', 'what', 'winner.This', 'movie', 'plot', 'predictable', 'formulaic', 'standard', 'talking', 'animal', 'fare', 'so', 'what', 'visuals', 'are', 'done', 'seamlessly', 'beautifully', 'messages', 'working', 'hard', 'achieve', 'goals', 'having', 'good', 'attitude', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'tough', 'are', 'very', 'timely', 'generation', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'running', 'gags', 'involve', 'potty', 'humor', 'even', 'adult', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'husband', 'liked', 'human', 'actors', 'as', 'much', 'charming', 'animals', 'even', 'villainess', 'personal', 'favorite', 'previous', 'roles', 'television', 'Most', 'importantly', 'was', 'feel', 'good', 'story', '*', 'kids*', 'loved', 'Was', 'sight', 'realistic-looking', 'talking', 'animals', 'enthralled', 'well-choreographed', 'action', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'IT', 'WORKED.Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'forget', 'kids', 'can', 'love', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'drive', 'wall', 'when', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'well', 'real', 'keeper.-Andrea', 'aka', 'Merribelle']",N/A

The keys to its success are a great story, a great cast of both animals and humans, and an indomitable spirit that few movies can convey over the course of 103 minutes.It's a sad beginning, as we see a young zebra accidentally left behind by a circus on a road in Kentucky; luckily, Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) finds the little guy and takes him home to his farm - where his daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere) instantly falls in love with him and names him - what else? - Stripes.  Stripes is also welcomed by the other animals on the farm - and it is here we learn that these animals can talk.  Talking animals is a bigger risk than you might think - it can easily flop if done poorly, but there are no worries here: the cast of voice actors is superb.  Dustin Hoffman plays a miniature horse named Tucker, Whoopi Goldberg is Franny the goat, Jeff Foxworthy is good for many laughs as Reggie the rooster, and the list goes on.  The farm lies adjacent to a horse track, and Stripes immediately decides he is a race horse - no one tells him he's a zebra.  It just so happens that Nolan is one of the best horse trainers around, but he left all of that behind some years earlier when his jockey wife was killed in a racing accident.  That doesn't stop Channing from wanting to ride, however, and Stripes is determined to some day prove himself on the track.  He takes a lot of abuse for this - the horses in this film, with one exception, are incredibly arrogant, hateful creatures that constantly make fun of Stripes.  Luckily, though, a pretty little filly named Sandy (Mandy Moore) befriends and encourages him.  I should mention the fact that Frankie Muniz supplies the voice of Stripes - and even Snoop Dogg contributes as the voice of Lightning, the world's laziest dog.The odds are against Stripes.  No zebra has ever raced with horses, and Nolan is adamantly opposed to letting his daughter race at all.  That's where Stripes' animal friends come in.  Even the newest addition to the farm, a Mafioso pelican named Goose (Joe Pantoliano) does his part.  The only characters who can give Goose a run for his money in terms of comedy are Buzz and Scuzz, two flies featuring the voices of Steve Harvey and David Spade.  Wait until you see them dance and sing.  A number of physical and emotional obstacles stand in the way of Stripes' realizing his dream.  To succeed, he will have to want it with all of his heart, stand up against ridicule and even physical threat (Sir Trenton is not going to sit still for a zebra joining in a race his son is supposed to win), discover who he is and what he is made of.  You'll want to stand up and cheer for this plucky little zebra with the heart of a champion.  There's so much more to this story, though.  Nolan's struggle to forget the past and support his daughter's dreams is quite emotional, the animals are all incredible characters themselves - especially Tucker, the little horse who helps train Stripes for the big race (and is amply rewarded in a very poignant moment).  I've always believed that we see the best of human nature through our animals, and that is certainly the case here.  The only complaint I have is that the talented animal actors who pretty much carried this film did not get their names listed in the credits.  This always bothers me; every human who had anything to do with these animals gets credited, but the animals themselves are snubbed - it should not be this way.  The animals make this movie and they deserve to have their own names in lights.I'll conclude with a warning: parents who buy this DVD for their kids can expect to see a lot of this movie, as kids will inevitably want to watch it multiple times.  The good news is that parents should enjoy multiple viewings of Racing Stripes just as much as their kids surely will.",5,Great fun for the whole family - one of the best movies of its kind,1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,4552,"['Just', 'when', 'start', 'thinking', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'anymore', 'go', 'make', 'one', 'Racing', 'Stripes', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'kind', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Animal', 'movies', 'always', 'get', 'suck', 'emotionally', 'more', 'other', 'kind', 'story', 'may', 'well', 'shed', 'tears', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'watch', 'film', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'more', 'ready', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'all', 'again', 'as', 'soon', 'reach', 'end', 'inspirational', 'film', 'full', 'kinds', 'truths', 'kids', 'need', 'learn', 'adults', 'need', 'remember', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'thus', 'far', 'new', 'century', 'keys', 'success', 'are', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'animals', 'humans', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'few', 'movies', 'can', 'convey', 'course', '103', 'minutes.It', 'sad', 'beginning', 'see', 'young', 'zebra', 'accidentally', 'left', 'behind', 'circus', 'road', 'Kentucky', 'luckily', 'Nolan', 'Walsh', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'little', 'guy', 'home', 'farm', 'where', 'daughter', 'Channing', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'instantly', 'love', 'names', 'what', 'else', 'Stripes', 'Stripes', 'also', 'welcomed', 'other', 'animals', 'farm', 'here', 'learn', 'animals', 'can', 'talk', 'Talking', 'animals', 'bigger', 'risk', 'might', 'think', 'can', 'easily', 'flop', 'done', 'poorly', 'are', 'worries', 'here', 'cast', 'voice', 'actors', 'superb', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'miniature', 'horse', 'named', 'Tucker', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Franny', 'goat', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'good', 'many', 'laughs', 'Reggie', 'rooster', 'list', 'farm', 'adjacent', 'horse', 'track', 'Stripes', 'immediately', 'race', 'horse', 'one', 'zebra', 'just', 'so', 'Nolan', 'one', 'best', 'horse', 'trainers', 'left', 'years', 'earlier', 'when', 'jockey', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'racing', 'accident', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Channing', 'wanting', 'ride', 'however', 'Stripes', 'determined', 'day', 'prove', 'track', 'lot', 'abuse', 'horses', 'film', 'one', 'exception', 'are', 'incredibly', 'arrogant', 'hateful', 'creatures', 'constantly', 'make', 'fun', 'Stripes', 'Luckily', 'though', 'pretty', 'little', 'filly', 'named', 'Sandy', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'should', 'mention', 'fact', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'voice', 'Stripes', 'even', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'voice', 'Lightning', 'world', 'laziest', 'dog.The', 'odds', 'are', 'Stripes', 'No', 'zebra', 'ever', 'raced', 'horses', 'Nolan', 'adamantly', 'opposed', 'letting', 'daughter', 'race', 'where', 'Stripes', 'animal', 'friends', 'come', 'Even', 'newest', 'addition', 'farm', 'Mafioso', 'pelican', 'named', 'Goose', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'part', 'only', 'characters', 'who', 'can', 'give', 'Goose', 'run', 'money', 'terms', 'comedy', 'are', 'Buzz', 'Scuzz', 'two', 'flies', 'featuring', 'voices', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'David', 'Spade', 'Wait', 'see', 'dance', 'sing', 'number', 'physical', 'emotional', 'obstacles', 'stand', 'way', 'Stripes', 'realizing', 'dream', 'succeed', 'will', 'have', 'want', 'heart', 'stand', 'up', 'ridicule', 'even', 'physical', 'threat', 'Sir', 'Trenton', 'not', 'going', 'sit', 'still', 'zebra', 'joining', 'race', 'son', 'supposed', 'win', 'discover', 'who', 'what', 'made', ""'ll"", 'want', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'plucky', 'little', 'zebra', 'heart', 'champion', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'though', 'Nolan', 'struggle', 'forget', 'past', 'support', 'daughter', 'dreams', 'quite', 'emotional', 'animals', 'are', 'incredible', 'characters', 'especially', 'Tucker', 'little', 'horse', 'who', 'train', 'Stripes', 'big', 'race', 'amply', 'rewarded', 'very', 'poignant', 'moment', ""'ve"", 'always', 'believed', 'see', 'best', 'human', 'nature', 'animals', 'certainly', 'case', 'here', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'talented', 'animal', 'actors', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'carried', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'names', 'listed', 'credits', 'always', 'human', 'who', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'animals', 'credited', 'animals', 'are', 'snubbed', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'way', 'animals', 'make', 'movie', 'deserve', 'have', 'own', 'names', 'lights.I', ""'ll"", 'conclude', 'warning', 'parents', 'who', 'buy', 'DVD', 'kids', 'can', 'expect', 'see', 'lot', 'movie', 'kids', 'will', 'inevitably', 'want', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'good', 'news', 'parents', 'should', 'enjoy', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Racing', 'Stripes', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'kids', 'surely', 'will']",N/A

895688,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B0007Z0NY6,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[3, 4]","Hollywood is not known for its originality.  Sure, a new idea comes along and revolutionizes the business, but most of the time, all the movie industry does is sequel, remake, or just repackage existing material.  Which is pretty much what ""Racing Stripes"" is: repackaged material for your viewing pleasure.  But in this case, it is not entirely a bad thing.In 1995, a movie called ""Babe"" graced the silver screen.  It was one of those revolutionary idea things, where there was a lot of publicity because this film was doing something else with the Disney-esque talking-animal-kid's-movie genre, which had been around for a while.  But thanks to this new thing called ""computer animation"" the filmmakers could make it look like the animals' mouths were actually moving in sync with the dialogue, rather than doing it the ""Mr. Ed"" way, where the animal just randomly moved its mouth.  ""Babe"" was a reasonably big success (big enough, obviously, to warrant a pointless and sub-par sequel), and I remember enjoying it as a kid.Since then, there have been a few attempts to recapture some of that, and those films were so memorable that I forgot their titles.  So now, here we are, ten years later, and ""Racing Stripes"" shows up.  It certainly was a long time coming, but this film is quite possibly the ""Babe"" for this new generation of little kids.Not surprisingly, the plot is almost a carbon copy of that movie about a talking pig who wanted to be a sheepdog.  A young zebra (voiced by Frankie Muniz) is accidentally abandoned by a circus in rural Kentucky (as if there's an urban Kentucky), and picked up by a local farmer (Bruce Greenwood) and his daughter (Hayden Panettiere).  As it turns out, the farmer is a former racehorse trainer, whose horses consistently won the Kentucky Derby.  So the little zebra, creatively named Stripes, gets introduced to the racing life early on, and fantasizes about racing in the Derby.  Of course it's preposterous that a zebra could win the race, everybody says, but Stripes is out to prove them wrong.The plot, as you can see, is very ""Babe""-ish, with some ""Seabiscut"" thrown in.  But it's okay because everyone who saw ""Babe"" as a kid is a teenager now, and this film is being exposed to a whole new audience.The supporting vocal cast is excellent, with Dustin Hoffman as a gruff Shetland pony who helps Stripes train, Whoopi Goldberg as a motherly goat, Steve Harvey and David Spade as wise-cracking flies, Joe Pantoliano as a Mafia pelican, and even rap icon Snoop Dogg as, well, a dog.But, all is not perfect here.  In places, ""Racing Stripes"" gets heavily bogged down with deep, thoughtful, super-sappy dialogue between farm animals.  If there weren't so many eye-rollingly bad soliloquies and heartfelt discussions, this film would get a 5-star rating in my book.",4,"""Stripes"" is strangely familiar",1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,2811,"['Hollywood', 'not', 'known', 'originality', 'Sure', 'new', 'idea', 'along', 'business', 'most', 'time', 'movie', 'industry', 'sequel', 'remake', 'just', 'repackage', 'existing', 'material', 'Which', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Racing', 'Stripes', 'repackaged', 'material', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'case', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad', 'thing.In', '1995', 'movie', 'called', 'Babe', 'graced', 'silver', 'screen', 'was', 'one', 'revolutionary', 'idea', 'things', 'where', 'was', 'lot', 'publicity', 'film', 'was', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'Disney-esque', ""talking-animal-kid's-movie"", 'genre', 'had', 'been', 'around', 'while', 'thanks', 'new', 'thing', 'called', 'computer', 'animation', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'make', 'look', 'animals', 'mouths', 'were', 'actually', 'moving', 'sync', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'doing', 'Mr.', 'Ed', 'way', 'where', 'animal', 'just', 'randomly', 'moved', 'mouth', 'Babe', 'was', 'reasonably', 'big', 'success', 'big', 'enough', 'obviously', 'warrant', 'pointless', 'sub-par', 'sequel', 'remember', 'enjoying', 'kid.Since', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'attempts', 'recapture', 'films', 'were', 'so', 'memorable', 'forgot', 'titles', 'So', 'now', 'here', 'are', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Racing', 'Stripes', 'up', 'certainly', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'film', 'quite', 'possibly', 'Babe', 'new', 'generation', 'little', 'kids.Not', 'surprisingly', 'plot', 'almost', 'carbon', 'copy', 'movie', 'talking', 'pig', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'sheepdog', 'young', 'zebra', 'voiced', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'accidentally', 'abandoned', 'circus', 'rural', 'Kentucky', 'urban', 'Kentucky', 'picked', 'up', 'local', 'farmer', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'daughter', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'out', 'farmer', 'former', 'racehorse', 'trainer', 'horses', 'consistently', 'won', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'little', 'zebra', 'creatively', 'named', 'Stripes', 'introduced', 'racing', 'life', 'early', 'racing', 'Derby', 'course', 'preposterous', 'zebra', 'could', 'win', 'race', 'everybody', 'Stripes', 'out', 'prove', 'wrong.The', 'plot', 'can', 'see', 'very', 'Babe', '-ish', 'Seabiscut', 'thrown', 'okay', 'everyone', 'who', 'saw', 'Babe', 'kid', 'teenager', 'now', 'film', 'being', 'exposed', 'whole', 'new', 'audience.The', 'supporting', 'vocal', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'gruff', 'Shetland', 'pony', 'who', 'Stripes', 'train', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'motherly', 'goat', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'David', 'Spade', 'wise-cracking', 'flies', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Mafia', 'pelican', 'even', 'rap', 'icon', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'well', 'dog.But', 'not', 'perfect', 'here', 'places', 'Racing', 'Stripes', 'heavily', 'bogged', 'down', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'super-sappy', 'dialogue', 'farm', 'animals', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'many', 'eye-rollingly', 'bad', 'soliloquies', 'heartfelt', 'discussions', 'film', 'would', 'get', '5-star', 'rating', 'book']",N/A

He is raised by a former racing horse trainer and his daughter and grows up believing that he is a racing horse and has a strong desire to become one of the greatest.Positives:1)  Talking animals.  If you liked ""Babe"" and the talking animals in ""Dr. Doolittle"" (the Eddie Murphy version) then you'll love the talking animals in ""Racing Stripes"".  They do a great job, even when trying to convey emotion.2)  Pulls at the Heart-Strings.  This isn't just a story of a zebra who wants to be a racing horse.  There are so many other plots and sub-plots.  By the end, they all get resolved, everybody is happy, and those who deserve to be pooped upon are done so by a gangster pelican.3)  Good message.  The overriding theme of the movie is one of my favorites: if you want something then work hard to get it.4)  Good acting.  With the exception of Wendie Malick (was she supposed to be THAT way over-the-top?), the acting by the human characters was quite good and believable.  The emotional range of Hayden Panettiere is pitch-perfect for every occasion of the film.Negatives:1)  Far too many adult jokes.  Some of the humor of this movie was too grown-up.  And if they were trying to be subtle with it, they did a horrible job with it.  It was one thing to imply a swear-word, but to actually use one is another matter.If it weren't for the adult jokes, I would recommend this for the entire family.

The story starts when a travelling circus gets caught in the storm, and they are in such a panic, that they accidentally leave behind a baby zebra. The zebra is found by Mr. Walsh, a retired horse trainer who is facing hard times.When he brings the zebra home, his daughter, Channing Walsh, adopts the zebra and names him Stripes.Stripes grows up on the Walsh Farm, which is in plain view of Turfway Park. From the moment Stripes sees the track, he's hooked; he's desperate to be a racer. Since he thinks he's a horse, he sees no reason why he shouldn't race.While on the Farm, Stripes meets an enemy, the cruel Thoroughbred Trenton's Pride, and a love, the beautiful Arabian Sandy. These horses increase Stripe's desire to become a racehorse.Meanwhile, Channing has problems, her dad won't let her become a jockey because her mother died while racing on a horse. He's also planning to sell Stipes, because Channing nearly got hurt while running on the track. Channing convinces her dad to keep Stripes. He accepts, but still son't let Channing be a jockey.Mean Ms. Darymple, who owns Trenton's Pride, is amused that Channing is interested in racing Stripe's, so she invites him to enter an important race called the Kentucky OPen, even if he is not a Thoroughbred.Mr. Walsh almost refuses, but Channing not only convinces him to enter Stripes, but to be a jockey. They keep on training and manage to get into the race, even if Trenton's Pride's cruel father, Sir Trenton, tries to stop him.This movie is kind of predictable, but it is warm hearted, cute, and funny.

It's probably not going to be a pleasant experience. I'm rather surprised the actual Turfway Park hasn't sued for defamation of character. (At least they put it in the correct state.) Don't get me started on jockey licensing, Thoroughbred breeding, and the hundred other little details overlooked by the movie, though I have to say none of them compared to turning the gorgeous Turfway Park, one of America's most beautiful racetracks (which, it should be noted, ironically doesn't have a turf course), into a county fair bullring. At least they didn't call it Keeneland.Okay. Now put aside all the technical stuff that's wrong with the movie. Is it any good from a layman's point of view? Well, it's not bad, mostly because of the voice talent. Such actors as Dustin Hoffman, Whoopi Goldberg, Frankie Muniz, Fred Dalton Thompson, and a number of other big names lent their voices to animals here with lovely results. The human actors, on the other hand, are to a person bad. Even the normally enjoyable Bruce Greenwood and the normally fantastic M. Emmett Walsh are bland and insipid here.But even if the voice talent is good, it's not running on much that's worthwhile. One reviewer called it ""Babe in stripes,"" and that's pretty much what it comes down to-- fish (erm, pig-- no, wait, zebra) out of water has to try and fit in among those who are different from him. But where Babe approached the idea with freshness, originality, and an innocent sweetness that approached fairy tale-quality, Racing Stripes just seems like a slightly degenerated retread; it's probably serviceable, but don't go for long drives in the desert, or it might blow on you far, far away from civilization. ** ",3,They really could've tried a little harder.,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,1823,"['Racing', 'Stripes', 'Frederick', 'Du', 'Chau', '2005', 'Watching', 'Racing', 'Stripes', 'rather', 'like', 'watching', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'paleontologist', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'pleasant', 'experience', ""'m"", 'rather', 'surprised', 'actual', 'Turfway', 'Park', ""n't"", 'sued', 'defamation', 'character', 'least', 'put', 'correct', 'state', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'jockey', 'licensing', 'Thoroughbred', 'breeding', 'hundred', 'other', 'little', 'details', 'overlooked', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'none', 'compared', 'turning', 'gorgeous', 'Turfway', 'Park', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'beautiful', 'racetracks', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'ironically', ""n't"", 'have', 'turf', 'course', 'county', 'fair', 'bullring', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'call', 'Keeneland.Okay', 'Now', 'put', 'aside', 'technical', 'stuff', 'wrong', 'movie', 'good', 'layman', 'point', 'view', 'Well', 'not', 'bad', 'mostly', 'voice', 'talent', 'Such', 'actors', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'Fred', 'Dalton', 'Thompson', 'number', 'other', 'big', 'names', 'lent', 'voices', 'animals', 'here', 'lovely', 'results', 'human', 'actors', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'person', 'bad', 'Even', 'normally', 'enjoyable', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'normally', 'fantastic', 'M.', 'Emmett', 'Walsh', 'are', 'bland', 'insipid', 'here.But', 'even', 'voice', 'talent', 'good', 'not', 'running', 'much', 'worthwhile', 'One', 'reviewer', 'called', 'Babe', 'stripes', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'down', 'fish', 'erm', 'pig', 'wait', 'zebra', 'water', 'try', 'fit', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'where', 'Babe', 'approached', 'idea', 'freshness', 'originality', 'innocent', 'sweetness', 'approached', 'fairy', 'tale-quality', 'Racing', 'Stripes', 'just', 'slightly', 'degenerated', 'retread', 'probably', 'serviceable', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'long', 'drives', 'desert', 'might', 'blow', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'civilization', '**']",N/A

The gangly little foal is rescued by horse farmer Nolan Walsh, who takes him home to his young daughter Channing. Once a champion thoroughbred trainer, Walsh has given up horse training for a quiet life with Channing on their modest Kentucky farm. The little zebra, or ""Stripes,"" as Channing calls him, is soon introduced to the farm's misfit troupe of barnyard residents, led by a cranky Shetland Pony named Tucker and Franny, a wise old goat who keeps the family in line. The group is joined by Goose, a deranged big-city pelican who's hiding out in the sticks until the heat dies down in Jersey. The un-aptly named bloodhound Lightening keeps a lazy eye on goings-on at the farm - in between naps. The Walsh farm borders the Turfway Racetrack, where highly skilled thoroughbreds compete for horse racing's top honor, the ultra-prestigious Kentucky Crown. From the first moment Stripes lays eyes on the track, he's hooked--he knows that if he could just get the chance, he could leave all those other horses in the dust. What he doesn't know is--he's not exactly a horse. But with characteristic zeal, he devotes himself to training for the big time, with a little help from Tucker, who has coached a host of champion racehorses in the past.

895760,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007Z0NY6,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","There is absolutely NO originality in 'Racing Stripes' but originality does not always mean a good family picture.  At least, I found 'Racing Stripes' pretty enjoyable, but not so great, because the idea of a spirited girl and a cute zebra joining in Kentukey Horse Race, sounds exactly like a cross between 'National Velvet' and 'Babe.'  And the heroine of 'Racing Stripes' looks like young Liz Taylor, doesn't she?Anyway, the film is about the zebra 'Stripes' (voiced by Frankie Munitz).  During the heavy storm, he was left behind by the traveling circus, but was found and kept by a retired horce trainer Mr. Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood)  Three years later, grown-up Stripes dreams of racing like horses (next to Mr. Walsh's farm, they are breeding thoroughbreds), and finally gets a chance to participate in the 'Kentukey Open.' (Actually, the film was shot in South Africa.)In the meanwhile, an equally cute girl, and Mr. Walsh's daughter Channing (Hayden Panetteire) is dreaming another thing -- riding a horse.  But as a tragic accident took the life of her mother away years ago, her dad would not listen.  Well, but of course, he would relent in the end.[VOICED BY...] One of the merits of the film is its impressive voice cast dubbing the animals living at and near the Walsh Farm.  Dustin Hoffman, Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Clark Duncan, Mandy Moore, Steve Harvey, David Spade, Jeff Foxworthy, Joshua Jackson, Michael Rosenbaum, Joe Pantliano, Fred Dalton Thompson, and Snoop Dogg (as dog named 'Lightnening').  The most effective is Hoffman as 'Tucker' an old horse who becomes the mentor to Stripes, and Pantliano as 'Goose' the Pelican who, he claims, is hiding from the mobsters because killing the wrong bird.[GOOD AND BAD] Good points about 'Racing' are its father-daughter relations, and the against-all-the-odds story of the zembra.  Greenwood and Panettiere are very convincing and likable, being the characters you are ready to relate to, and the animals are always scene-stealers on the screen.  But the film borrows so many bits from others, and when it tries to add something new -- like gags or parodies -- they mostly go wrong.  The misguided idea of the horses threating like gangsters (and kidnapping too!) another horse is laughable, and hardly appropriate in family pictures, and the relentless attack of ineffective toilet humor only help degrade the film.The film has some good bits here and there, from the humans and animals alike, but it never reaches the quality of 'Babe' and other family pictures.

895765,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0007Z0NY6,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[0, 0]","Racing Stripes is actually a lot more entertaining and funny than I had expected. The story of a circus zebra(Stripes) adopted by a corn farmer/ex-race horse trainer Nolan Walsh(Bruce Greenwood), and eventually became a race horse when Channing Walsh(Hayden Panettiere) learned that it was a fast runner after riding it to work. At first, Nolan was reluctant to let his daughter to get into the race, because he feared that it was dangerous and that Stripes wasn't good enough. Soon the animals in the barn came up with a plan to convince him that Stripes was the perfect race horse, and deserved to be trained.The talking animals featured the voices of some well-known stars including Mandy Moore(Sandy the horse), Frankie Muntz(Stripes), Whoopi Goldberg, and Dustin Hoffman.It's a very good family film, and both Greenwood and Panettiere were wonderful and touching.
