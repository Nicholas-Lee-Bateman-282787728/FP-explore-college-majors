684896,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005UQ6M,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I was pretty worried going into Nothing In Common earlier tonight.  I seem to be a VERY picky person when it comes to Tom Hank films.  Besides Forest Gump, I mostly only like his ultra serious films, such as Saving Private Ryan and a few others that escape my mind at the moment.I still believe Tom Hanks hit the high point in his career around 10 years ago.  He didn't exactly start out as an incredible movie star.  It took him a long time to get going and win over movie watchers.However, Nothing In Common turned out to be good.  Not GREAT by any stretch of the imagination- just barely good enough that I recommend sticking through the first hour of useless storytelling in order to get to the good stuff (the good being Tom Hanks' characters relationship with his father).The first hour of Nothing In Comming features nothing but Hanks' character trying to sleep with a few different women, and he ends up succeeding.  I guess these moments are supposed to qualify as humor, or romantic-style humor, but for me it doesn't exactly work because there's no interesting storyline development while this is going on.  Some of the other characters he communicates with is rather unexceptional and pointless to include in the story as well.  Makes me wonder what movie writers were thinking back then.The film is also SEVERELY dated.  It's definitely stuck in the mid 80's, right down to the ugly predictable pacing and the wimpy music that's supposed to pass the test as ""beautiful"" and ""fitting the mood"".  Prepare yourself for a huge smack of the 80's right in your face as far as the soundtrack and presentation is concerned.At least the relationship between Tom Hanks' character and his father actually got good starting around the halfway point, otherwise this would have easily been a 1-star forgettable (and laughable) movie for Tom Hanks.  He moved on to *much* better things later on.",3,improves later,1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,1893,"['was', 'pretty', 'worried', 'going', 'Nothing', 'Common', 'earlier', 'tonight', 'seem', 'be', 'VERY', 'picky', 'person', 'when', 'Tom', 'Hank', 'films', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'mostly', 'only', 'ultra', 'serious', 'films', 'such', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'few', 'others', 'escape', 'mind', 'moment.I', 'still', 'believe', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'hit', 'high', 'point', 'career', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'start', 'out', 'incredible', 'movie', 'star', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'going', 'win', 'movie', 'watchers.However', 'Nothing', 'Common', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'Not', 'GREAT', 'stretch', 'imagination-', 'just', 'barely', 'good', 'enough', 'recommend', 'sticking', 'first', 'hour', 'useless', 'storytelling', 'order', 'get', 'good', 'stuff', 'good', 'being', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'characters', 'relationship', 'father', '.The', 'first', 'hour', 'Nothing', 'Comming', 'features', 'nothing', 'Hanks', 'character', 'trying', 'sleep', 'few', 'different', 'women', 'up', 'succeeding', 'guess', 'moments', 'are', 'supposed', 'qualify', 'humor', 'romantic-style', 'humor', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'work', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'development', 'going', 'other', 'characters', 'rather', 'unexceptional', 'pointless', 'include', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'what', 'movie', 'writers', 'were', 'thinking', 'back', 'then.The', 'film', 'also', 'SEVERELY', 'dated', 'definitely', 'stuck', 'mid', '80', 'right', 'down', 'ugly', 'predictable', 'pacing', 'wimpy', 'music', 'supposed', 'pass', 'test', 'beautiful', 'fitting', 'mood', 'Prepare', 'huge', 'smack', '80', 'right', 'face', 'as', 'far', 'soundtrack', 'presentation', 'concerned.At', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'character', 'father', 'actually', 'got', 'good', 'starting', 'halfway', 'point', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'been', '1-star', 'forgettable', 'laughable', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'moved', '*much*', 'better', 'things', 'later']",N/A

684898,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005UQ6M,Craig Matteson,"[7, 9]","""Nothing in Common"" is Tom Hanks' first dramatic role (though there are plenty of comedic moments) and Jackie Gleason's last movie role.  Both do a fine job as a father and son who really have no use and less understanding of each other.  Of course, there is a crisis (actually a series of crises) that forces them to choose further alienation or reconciliation.  You will have to watch the movie to find out - and I encourage you to do so.Tom Hanks plays David Basner, a young and talented up-and-coming ad executive.  He is in all ways the flower of the YUPPIE ethos including the pre-AIDS casual attitude towards sex and relationships.  Gleason plays Max Basner who is a way past his prime manufacturers rep for a children's clothes manufacturer.  Max is by all accounts a difficult and angry man who used to be quite a charmer and ladies man.Eva Marie Saint plays Lorraine Basner.  Lorraine was trapped into a marriage some would call loveless, but it is much more complicated than that.  Again, you will have to watch the movie to learn all the subtleties, but during the film she decides to break free and ""find herself"" by walking out of her home and marriage to file for divorce and get the first job of her life.  Both Max and Lorraine begin relying on David in ways that reverse the parent - child relationship and put a real strain and the solo life and upward career path David is enjoying.To complete the sea of troubles, David is in the middle of trying to land a huge airline deal for his firm that would likely make him a partner and has also developed a mutual attachment with Cheryl Ann Wayne (played by the amazing Sela Ward) who is important on the airline account for multiple reasons.  Plus, there is the old friend who really needs to be more, Donna Martin, played wonderfully by Bess Armstrong.Some have criticized the movie as having two minds.  The stuff at the office is fun, raucous, aggressive, and often very funny.  The Basner family saga is often very painful.  I actually found the clash of these two stories more or less realistic.  Many young professionals experience a much different life at work than at home and that leads to a lot of stress, broken marriages, and lots of counseling hours.While I am not thrilled with all the choices the characters make along the way, I do think the movie ends in a good place - though some might find it maudlin.  In my view, the character that comes off best is Charlie Gargas, David's Boss, played by the always effective Hector Elizondo.Other reasons to view the film again are the very young and pre- Homer Simpson Dan Castellaneta, the now strange 80's fashions, and the wonderful exchanges between David Basner and the deadpan secretary, and Conrad Janis on trombone with his jazz band (however briefly).I think the best reason to see the film is the performance delivered by Jackie Gleason.  It is a tour de force of how to provide humanity to such an unsympathetic character.  There is much subtlety and skill in his portrayal of Max Basner and it is very memorable.",4,More serious than you might expect for a film this funny,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,3048,"['Nothing', 'Common', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'first', 'dramatic', 'role', 'are', 'plenty', 'comedic', 'moments', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'last', 'movie', 'role', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'really', 'have', 'use', 'less', 'understanding', 'other', 'course', 'crisis', 'actually', 'series', 'crises', 'choose', 'further', 'alienation', 'reconciliation', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'encourage', 'do', 'so.Tom', 'Hanks', 'David', 'Basner', 'young', 'talented', 'up-and-coming', 'ad', 'executive', 'ways', 'flower', 'YUPPIE', 'ethos', 'including', 'pre-AIDS', 'casual', 'attitude', 'towards', 'sex', 'relationships', 'Gleason', 'Max', 'Basner', 'who', 'way', 'prime', 'manufacturers', 'rep', 'children', 'clothes', 'manufacturer', 'Max', 'accounts', 'difficult', 'angry', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'quite', 'charmer', 'ladies', 'man.Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Lorraine', 'Basner', 'Lorraine', 'was', 'trapped', 'marriage', 'would', 'call', 'loveless', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'Again', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'learn', 'subtleties', 'film', 'break', 'free', 'find', 'walking', 'home', 'marriage', 'file', 'divorce', 'get', 'first', 'job', 'life', 'Max', 'Lorraine', 'begin', 'relying', 'David', 'ways', 'reverse', 'parent', 'child', 'relationship', 'put', 'real', 'strain', 'solo', 'life', 'upward', 'career', 'path', 'David', 'enjoying.To', 'complete', 'sea', 'troubles', 'David', 'middle', 'trying', 'land', 'huge', 'airline', 'deal', 'firm', 'would', 'likely', 'make', 'partner', 'also', 'developed', 'mutual', 'attachment', 'Cheryl', 'Ann', 'Wayne', 'played', 'amazing', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'who', 'important', 'airline', 'account', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'more', 'Donna', 'Martin', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Bess', 'Armstrong.Some', 'have', 'criticized', 'movie', 'having', 'two', 'minds', 'stuff', 'office', 'fun', 'raucous', 'aggressive', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'Basner', 'family', 'saga', 'often', 'very', 'painful', 'actually', 'found', 'clash', 'two', 'stories', 'more', 'less', 'realistic', 'Many', 'young', 'professionals', 'experience', 'much', 'different', 'life', 'work', 'home', 'lot', 'stress', 'broken', 'marriages', 'lots', 'counseling', 'hours.While', 'am', 'not', 'thrilled', 'choices', 'characters', 'make', 'way', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'good', 'place', 'might', 'find', 'view', 'character', 'off', 'best', 'Charlie', 'Gargas', 'David', 'Boss', 'played', 'always', 'effective', 'Hector', 'Elizondo.Other', 'reasons', 'view', 'film', 'again', 'are', 'very', 'young', 'pre-', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'Dan', 'Castellaneta', 'now', 'strange', '80', 'fashions', 'wonderful', 'exchanges', 'David', 'Basner', 'deadpan', 'secretary', 'Conrad', 'Janis', 'trombone', 'jazz', 'band', 'however', 'briefly', 'think', 'best', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'performance', 'delivered', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'tour', 'force', 'how', 'provide', 'humanity', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'much', 'subtlety', 'skill', 'portrayal', 'Max', 'Basner', 'very', 'memorable']",N/A

It is a favorite movie of mine.The film, released in 1986, was not a great financial success, but itbecame more popular as Hanks's fame grew. It is considered by some tobe a pivotal role in Hanks's career because it marked his transitionfrom less developed comedic roles to becoming a leading actor in moreserious stories, while many critics also praised Gleason's performance,which was his last movie. The original music score was composed byPatrick Leonard. The film was marketed with the tagline ""On his way upthe corporate ladder, David Basner confronts his greatest challenge:his father."" Happy-go-lucky advertising executive David Basner, whorecently got a promotion at his Chicago ad agency, returns to work froma vacation. He is utterly carefree until his parents split up after 36years of marriage.Out of the blue, he must care for his aging, bitter father Max (playedby Gleason), as well as be there for his emotionally fragile mother,Lorraine (played by Eva Marie Saint). To add insult to injury, Max hasjust been fired from his 35-year career in the garment industry.At work, David is developing a commercial for Colonial Airlines, ownedby the rich and eccentric Andrew Woolridge. A successful ad campaignwould likely promote David to partner in his company. David develops arelationship with Woolridge's daughter, no-nonsense Cheryl Ann Wayne.His father is well aware of David's playboy nature. Asking at one pointif his son is in bed with a woman, Max adds: ""Anybody you know?"" Theparents begin to rely more and more on David, calling him on the phoneconstantly. His mother needs help moving to a new apartment. His fatherneeds to be driven to an eye doctor. Lorraine needs to be rescued in abar after going out on a date with another man, having becomefrightened when he tried to kiss her goodnight.David's mother then confides to him that Max cheated on her andhumiliated her. An enraged David goes to confront Max. Their argumentends with David saying: ""Tomorrow I'm shooting a commercial about afamily who loves each other, who cares about each other. I'm fakin'it."" The next day, David is distracted by the deterioratingrelationship with his dad and it affects his work. As a peace offering,David offers to take Max to a nightclub to hear some of the jazz musicMax likes. It is there that David accidentally discovers a secret Maxhas been hiding: diabetes. His foot is gangrened.Max must go to the hospital. While awaiting surgery, he and Lorraineshare their thoughts about their life together, with Lorrainecondemning him for doing what he did to himself and to her. Max sobsover his mistakes once he is alone.At the agency, Andrew Woolridge insists that David go to New York withhim to promote his new ad campaign. David refuses, saying he wants tostay with his sick father. Woolridge complains that it's unnecessary.David tells him off and is fired.The next day, David accompanies his dad to the operating room. His bossCharlie assures him that he will personally smooth things over withWoolridge, so David should take some time off.Max loses two toes. When he goes home from the hospital, David pusheshis wheelchair. Max admits to his son: ""You were the last person Ithought would come through for me.""

Hanks, a smooth-talking corporate '80s ad exec, and Gleason, a foot-to-pavement salesman struggling to deal with the end of his career, manage well with the heavy stuff while occasionally injecting a few welcome dashes of humor and sarcasm to the mix. The film is flawed, though, in its unbridled lack of restraint. Every last supporting character hints at a big, convoluted back story and many of them are halfheartedly explored. That diverts attention away from the key players and leaves us with what seems like one big, fuzzy, unfocused batch of incomplete or unfulfilling arcs.

684903,A3IB5WCHJVJA4N,B00005UQ6M,"MF Regan ""Seth""","[6, 6]","This is the first movie where Tom Hanks really began to show his depth. It was a film that required him to open with the comedic chops he's honed so well but then, because of the deepening of the film's story from comedy to drama, requested so much more of him. He ultimately delivers in spades.This is really a story about a son moving very fast in the fast lane of advertising. He's a pro and he loves what he does. He's also a personality that lives on charm and in the moment.  But when his parents separate after years of marriage, his life changes rapidly from no personal responsibilities to a multitude of them. It's also begs a question that rarely gets told well- how do sons and daughters deal with parents as life turns the tables and we suddenly start having to deal with listening to and taking care of them? The changing of roles and responsibilities. As the film unfolds, it presents those concerns with proper weight, depth, sadness, growth and understanding.Gary Marshall directed the film prior to his mega hit with Pretty Woman but I really think this is the better film of the two. He draws the best from Jackie Gleason, Eva Marie Saint and Beth Armstrong and Hector Alonzo- each lending a real ensemble cast feeling to the piece and although Tom Hanks shines- so do they.Jackie Gleason deserves special mention because he really plays a rather hard, sad man at the end of the road as a clothing salesman, and he digs deep, never lending anything false to how this man thinks, feels and operates. The exchanges between him and Hanks about how he was raised lend a real truth to the role.If you're looking for a film that has some humor and some depth of feeling in the same breath, this is an interesting evening's viewing.An underrated film that deserves a second look and a larger audience.",3,Cats in the Cradle Revised,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,1813,"['first', 'movie', 'where', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'really', 'began', 'show', 'depth', 'was', 'film', 'required', 'open', 'comedic', 'honed', 'so', 'well', 'then', 'deepening', 'film', 'story', 'comedy', 'drama', 'requested', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'ultimately', 'spades.This', 'really', 'story', 'son', 'moving', 'very', 'fast', 'fast', 'lane', 'advertising', 'pro', 'what', 'also', 'personality', 'charm', 'moment', 'when', 'parents', 'separate', 'years', 'marriage', 'life', 'changes', 'rapidly', 'personal', 'responsibilities', 'multitude', 'also', 'question', 'rarely', 'told', 'well-', 'how', 'do', 'sons', 'daughters', 'deal', 'parents', 'life', 'tables', 'suddenly', 'start', 'having', 'deal', 'listening', 'taking', 'care', 'changing', 'roles', 'responsibilities', 'film', 'unfolds', 'concerns', 'proper', 'weight', 'depth', 'sadness', 'growth', 'understanding.Gary', 'Marshall', 'directed', 'film', 'prior', 'mega', 'hit', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'really', 'think', 'better', 'film', 'two', 'best', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Beth', 'Armstrong', 'Hector', 'Alonzo-', 'lending', 'real', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'feeling', 'piece', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'shines-', 'so', 'do', 'they.Jackie', 'Gleason', 'special', 'mention', 'really', 'rather', 'hard', 'sad', 'man', 'end', 'road', 'clothing', 'salesman', 'deep', 'never', 'lending', 'anything', 'false', 'how', 'man', 'feels', 'exchanges', 'Hanks', 'how', 'was', 'raised', 'lend', 'real', 'truth', 'role.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'humor', 'depth', 'feeling', 'same', 'breath', 'interesting', 'evening', 'viewing.An', 'underrated', 'film', 'second', 'look', 'larger', 'audience']",N/A

Before he made the ill-advised ""Philadelphia"" and then the cleverer ""Forrest Gump"", Hanks was actually a fairly broad comic actor. Some of his movies hit the mark, like ""Splash"" and ""The Money Pit"", and others bombed badly, like ""The Man With One Red Shoe"" and ""Bachelor Party"". He was great at playing overly-confident, affable yuppies that were almost always put-upon in the extreme or finding themselves in odd situations, like he did in this one.In this movie, Hanks plays David Basner, a hotshot adman in Chicago, with comical co-workers and upper-middle-aged parents that are breaking up. While he tries romancing the daughter of a major client, (Sela Ward, hubba-hubba!) he also has to deal with his poor father (Jackie Gleason) losing his wife of 40 years and his job, all within the same month! The ""tough love"" tenderness Basner uses with his dad is offset by the kid gloves he uses with his mother, played by Eva Marie Saint. There are some ingenious comic scenes in this film, such as the ad company presentation to the Texan airline owner client, father of the Sela Ward character, (the woman with the guitar voicing the old lady on the plane is priceless,) and some other ad proposals are done well too. However, it is the later scenes with Max, his father, that will probably get to you the most. This was Jackie Gleason's last movie, and it is LIGHT YEARS better than most of the stuff he starred in late in his career, specifically the ""Smokey & The Bandit"" movies and ""The Sting II"". Hanks would go on to make ""Joe Versus The Volcano"", which was really Meg Ryan's movie more than his, his last broad comedy, and then made ""A League of Their Own"", which changed his career as well as saved it. There was no looking back after ""Philadelphia"", which was actually his first totally dramatic role.Frankly, I kinda miss the affable yuppy Hanks and would love to see him in another ""Money Pit"".Whaddya say, Tom....huh?",4,One of Hanks better movies....,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1972,"['went', 'soporific', 'everybody', 'made', 'ill-advised', 'Philadelphia', 'then', 'cleverer', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Hanks', 'was', 'actually', 'fairly', 'broad', 'comic', 'actor', 'movies', 'hit', 'mark', 'Splash', 'Money', 'Pit', 'others', 'bombed', 'badly', 'Man', 'One', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'was', 'great', 'playing', 'overly-confident', 'affable', 'yuppies', 'were', 'almost', 'always', 'put-upon', 'extreme', 'finding', 'odd', 'situations', 'did', 'one.In', 'movie', 'Hanks', 'David', 'Basner', 'hotshot', 'adman', 'Chicago', 'comical', 'co-workers', 'upper-middle-aged', 'parents', 'are', 'breaking', 'up', 'romancing', 'daughter', 'major', 'client', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'hubba-hubba', 'also', 'deal', 'poor', 'father', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'losing', 'wife', '40', 'years', 'job', 'same', 'month', 'tough', 'love', 'tenderness', 'Basner', 'dad', 'offset', 'kid', 'mother', 'played', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'are', 'ingenious', 'comic', 'scenes', 'film', 'such', 'ad', 'company', 'presentation', 'Texan', 'airline', 'owner', 'client', 'father', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'character', 'woman', 'guitar', 'voicing', 'old', 'lady', 'plane', 'priceless', 'other', 'ad', 'proposals', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'too', 'However', 'later', 'scenes', 'Max', 'father', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'most', 'was', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'last', 'movie', 'LIGHT', 'YEARS', 'better', 'most', 'stuff', 'starred', 'late', 'career', 'specifically', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'movies', 'Sting', 'II', 'Hanks', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'Joe', 'Versus', 'Volcano', 'was', 'really', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'more', 'last', 'broad', 'comedy', 'then', 'made', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'changed', 'career', 'as', 'well', 'saved', 'was', 'looking', 'back', 'Philadelphia', 'was', 'actually', 'first', 'totally', 'dramatic', 'role.Frankly', 'kinda', 'affable', 'yuppy', 'Hanks', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Money', 'Pit', '.Whaddya', 'say', 'Tom', '.huh']",N/A

What I'm saying is that this one does not come out swinging. But stick with it and you'll find something overwhelmingly beautiful.Without giving too much away, let me say that this is no typical romantic comedy. You fully expect things to follow the usual Hollywood generic script-styling. But it's going to throw you more than a few curves. These characters feel like real people. It's a lot like the real world. There's no real enemy, just misunderstood individuals with tangled webs; some easier unspun than others. It is a breath of fresh air, even more than 20 years after having been filmed.If you want something lighthearted from beginning to end with a guaranteed outcome of something ideal for everyone, then look elsewhere. But if you want something that stands a chance of striking the more fragile emotional chords within you, then I could not recommend this movie more.

684908,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005UQ6M,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[1, 1]","With my family on aThe Honeymoonerskick (including theThe Lost Episodes) from Gleason's earlier variety show), they wanted to see some later work by him.Of course, with my family also being Tom Hanks fans, this film was an easy choice for a lazy Sunday afternoon.  When I first saw this film it seemed funnier to me, but perhaps that is because the serious stuff really didn't hit home at that point in my youth, but having had my father die a rather lonely and broken man in a nursing home earlier this year, I found this story more poignant than in my youth.  The story now rings more true and instead of noticing the comedy in a drama, as I did in my younger days, I am now finding the drama in the comedy.  Amazing how life experience can alter a perspective.Tom Hanks plays, for the upteenth time, an immature adult who can't keep serious relationships, thinks life is one big joke, and, in his own words, moved away from home and just ""waited for his parents to die.""  In spite of his callous nature, both his attitude and behavior is rather realistic and, even likable at times.  He just wants to coast through and enjoy life without a lot of emotional baggage and having grown up in a home with a distant and somewhat absent father and a doting, but emotionally frigid mother, one can understand his desire to enjoy and experience a life he never had growing up in the first place; hence, Tom creates a believable character who at times is both lovable and annoying as all hell.Hanks' character gets an emotional and literal wake-up call when his father, wonderfully played by Gleason in, ironically, his last role, tells him in both a sad and sensationally funny dialogue of how his, Tom's, mother has left . . . with everything.  At this point, many reviewers here reveal far too much of the story that little surprises that would have been nice to discover while watching the film are now lost if you've read the other reviews, including the Spotlight ones.  I won't go that road other than to say that things regarding the parents in this film are nothing like they appear as the title refers not only to Tom and Gleason, but also Gleason and Eva Marie Saint who plays his wife in a terrifically understated performance.What was intended as a comedy about family relationships between people who have little in common other than last name, eventually becomes a serious story that is only laced with humor and poignant humor at that.  Gleason's last role is as memorable as his Ralph Kramden, an equally bull-headed, loud, pipe-dreamer, who, while having some awful character traits, is still sympathetic.  Although this character is far less lovable than Kramden's whose motives where always covered with good intentions, this character is more bitter and hurt and that is why many of us can identify with him in one way or another.  He is very reminicent of Willy Loman inDeath of a Salesmanin that he feels like a failure, but boasts of being a success to cover his hurt.  Life has somehow passed him by and his family life is nothing like he had hoped or imagined it would be.  Life, in short, has been one great letdown for him.The supporting roles are wonderfully filled by the ever reliable Hector Elizando (Pretty Woman) as Tom's hair deficient but understanding boss, the cute as a button Bess Armstrong (whose career never took off, but should have easily) as Tom's old flame who is always there for hm, and the terrific Eva Marie Saint.  Relative newcomer at the time, Sela Ward ofThe Day After TomorrowandThe Fugitiveis about as hot as you can get without literally being on fire.  I have always thought she was one of our great looking ""mature"" actresses (she is older than most think), but to see her here in 1986 . . . WOW doesn't even cover it.  Of course, this woman has acting chops to go with the great looks and nearly steals the film out from under Hanks every time they are on screen together.Well, there you have it.  A film heavily promoted as a comedy, with two great comedians (of which Hanks was mostly known as at the time), is far more a moving drama only laced with humor on family relationships and the impact our homelives have on us as adults and at what costs we measure success.",4,"Not as funny as promoted, but an effective comedy-drama.",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,4224,"['family', 'aThe', 'Honeymoonerskick', 'including', 'theThe', 'Lost', 'Episodes', 'Gleason', 'earlier', 'variety', 'show', 'wanted', 'see', 'later', 'work', 'him.Of', 'course', 'family', 'also', 'being', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'fans', 'film', 'was', 'easy', 'choice', 'lazy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'seemed', 'funnier', 'perhaps', 'serious', 'stuff', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'home', 'point', 'youth', 'having', 'had', 'father', 'die', 'rather', 'lonely', 'broken', 'man', 'nursing', 'home', 'earlier', 'year', 'found', 'story', 'more', 'poignant', 'youth', 'story', 'now', 'more', 'true', 'instead', 'noticing', 'comedy', 'drama', 'did', 'younger', 'days', 'am', 'now', 'finding', 'drama', 'comedy', 'Amazing', 'how', 'life', 'experience', 'can', 'alter', 'perspective.Tom', 'Hanks', 'plays', 'upteenth', 'time', 'immature', 'adult', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'serious', 'relationships', 'life', 'one', 'big', 'joke', 'own', 'words', 'moved', 'away', 'home', 'just', 'waited', 'parents', 'die', 'spite', 'callous', 'nature', 'attitude', 'behavior', 'rather', 'realistic', 'even', 'likable', 'times', 'just', 'coast', 'enjoy', 'life', 'lot', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'home', 'distant', 'somewhat', 'absent', 'father', 'doting', 'emotionally', 'frigid', 'mother', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'desire', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'life', 'never', 'had', 'growing', 'up', 'first', 'place', 'hence', 'Tom', 'believable', 'character', 'who', 'times', 'lovable', 'annoying', 'hell.Hanks', 'character', 'emotional', 'literal', 'wake-up', 'call', 'when', 'father', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Gleason', 'ironically', 'last', 'role', 'sad', 'sensationally', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'how', 'Tom', 'mother', 'left', 'everything', 'point', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'reveal', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'little', 'surprises', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'discover', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'now', 'lost', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'including', 'Spotlight', 'ones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'road', 'other', 'say', 'things', 'regarding', 'parents', 'film', 'are', 'nothing', 'appear', 'title', 'not', 'only', 'Tom', 'Gleason', 'also', 'Gleason', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'who', 'wife', 'terrifically', 'understated', 'performance.What', 'was', 'intended', 'comedy', 'family', 'relationships', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'other', 'last', 'name', 'eventually', 'serious', 'story', 'only', 'laced', 'humor', 'poignant', 'humor', 'Gleason', 'last', 'role', 'as', 'memorable', 'Ralph', 'Kramden', 'equally', 'bull-headed', 'loud', 'pipe-dreamer', 'who', 'having', 'awful', 'character', 'traits', 'still', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'far', 'less', 'lovable', 'Kramden', 'motives', 'where', 'always', 'covered', 'good', 'intentions', 'character', 'more', 'bitter', 'hurt', 'why', 'many', 'can', 'identify', 'one', 'way', 'very', 'reminicent', 'Willy', 'Loman', 'inDeath', 'Salesmanin', 'failure', 'being', 'success', 'cover', 'hurt', 'Life', 'somehow', 'passed', 'family', 'life', 'nothing', 'had', 'hoped', 'imagined', 'would', 'be', 'Life', 'short', 'been', 'one', 'great', 'letdown', 'him.The', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'filled', 'ever', 'reliable', 'Hector', 'Elizando', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Tom', 'hair', 'deficient', 'understanding', 'boss', 'cute', 'button', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'career', 'never', 'took', 'off', 'should', 'have', 'easily', 'Tom', 'old', 'flame', 'who', 'always', 'hm', 'terrific', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Relative', 'newcomer', 'time', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'ofThe', 'Day', 'TomorrowandThe', 'Fugitiveis', 'as', 'hot', 'can', 'get', 'literally', 'being', 'fire', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'looking', 'mature', 'actresses', 'older', 'most', 'think', 'see', 'here', '1986', 'WOW', ""n't"", 'even', 'cover', 'course', 'woman', 'acting', 'chops', 'go', 'great', 'looks', 'nearly', 'steals', 'film', 'Hanks', 'time', 'are', 'screen', 'together.Well', 'have', 'A', 'film', 'heavily', 'promoted', 'comedy', 'two', 'great', 'comedians', 'Hanks', 'was', 'mostly', 'known', 'time', 'far', 'more', 'moving', 'drama', 'only', 'laced', 'humor', 'family', 'relationships', 'impact', 'homelives', 'have', 'adults', 'what', 'measure', 'success']",N/A
