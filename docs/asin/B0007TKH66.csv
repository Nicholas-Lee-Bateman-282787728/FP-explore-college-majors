I always found the level of set & story detail to be amazing (maybe subsequent DVD sets will go into that more). That might be some critic's problem with Enterprise- the NX-01 looked so much better than previous ships.I did like the introduction of the Klingons(Broken Bow)but didn't care for the Suliban/temporal wars angle (never really handled well then slopped off at the end of third/start of fourth seasons). I don't remember the Andorians (The Andorian Incident, Shadows of P'Jem)all that well from the original series but I ""liked"" the way they were presented here. The Vulcans (most episodes) were very different from what we've always known, too bad it took four years to get around to really explaining that. I am one of those who did like the presentation, just wish they'd handled it better.Many of the stories are of the ""I've seen it before"" variety but what do you expect after almost 40 years? I wish the series had gone on for at lest 2 or 3 more years. Most of the stories will hold up pretty well with time, better than many in the original series.I liked the extra's but think the packaging is way overdone (seems to be a Star Trek trait)and dislike the pricing (very high but Amazon is as cheap as anyone when you figure in free shipping)but I'll buy the other sets when they come out, and hope they've got the behind the scenes stuff this set doesn't have.",4,"Some good stories, beautifully detailed, deserved more years",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,1500,"[""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'seemed', 'hate', 'Enterprise', 'was', ""n't"", 'Kirk', 'Picard', 'was', 'prequel', 'versions', 'always', 'found', 'level', 'set', 'story', 'detail', 'be', 'amazing', 'maybe', 'subsequent', 'DVD', 'sets', 'will', 'go', 'more', 'might', 'be', 'critic', 'problem', 'Enterprise-', 'NX-01', 'looked', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'ships.I', 'did', 'introduction', 'Klingons', 'Broken', 'Bow', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Suliban/temporal', 'wars', 'angle', 'never', 'really', 'handled', 'well', 'then', 'slopped', 'off', 'end', 'third/start', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Andorians', 'Andorian', 'Incident', 'Shadows', ""P'Jem"", 'well', 'original', 'series', 'liked', 'way', 'were', 'presented', 'here', 'Vulcans', 'most', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'what', ""'ve"", 'always', 'known', 'too', 'bad', 'took', 'four', 'years', 'get', 'really', 'explaining', 'am', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'presentation', 'just', 'wish', ""'d"", 'handled', 'better.Many', 'stories', 'are', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'variety', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'wish', 'series', 'had', 'gone', 'lest', '2', '3', 'more', 'years', 'Most', 'stories', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'time', 'better', 'many', 'original', 'series.I', 'liked', 'extra', 'think', 'packaging', 'way', 'overdone', 'be', 'Star', 'Trek', 'trait', 'dislike', 'pricing', 'very', 'high', 'Amazon', 'as', 'cheap', 'anyone', 'when', 'figure', 'free', 'shipping', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'other', 'sets', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'got', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'set', ""n't"", 'have']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

889251,A19HQVND02SRWE,B0007TKH66,Alan,"[21, 48]","I'm not sure if the decision to make a Star Trek prequel was influenced in any way by the *Star Wars* prequels, but whatever the reasoning, it didn't pay off.  The recent cancellation of Star Trek: Enterprise (originally just titled ""Enterprise"") is vindication to myself and others who used to be Star Trek fans, but feel that the series (or as the execs call it, the ""franchise"") has long since lost its way.  I was reminded of the reasons I dislike the newer Trek shows recently when I tuned into Enterprise and in a matter of one minute heard the words ""gravimetric"" and ""anamoly"".  Trek used to be about good, smart storytelling, and not about technobabble and using technologocial ""deus ex machinas"" to solve their problems each week.  In fact, one of the early Star Trek writer's guides states that, while grounded to the best of their abilities in science, the episodes should not rely on science at the expense of storytelling (or something to that effect).While Scott Bakula is good as Caprain Archer, I had a hard time telling any of the other characters apart.  This wasn't due to a lack of talent or skill on the actors' part, but rather the writing, and for that matter, costuming, made it hard to distinguish one from the other.  Then there's that whole matter of a ""temporal cold war"", the alien alliance which looked all-too similar to the seperatist aliens in ""Attack Of The Clones"", and the willingness to just toss Trek continuity out the window.  I'd like to thank co-producer and scribe Brannon Braga for almost single-handedly taking something that I used to enjoy and beating it into the ground.  Sure, it's impressive that he worked his way up the Trek totem-pole from intern to co-producer, and that he hooked up with Jeri Ryan, but the guy has no respect for the fan base that made Star Trek a success, and not a short-lived, forgotten TV series.  And don't I sound like a total geek now!  But in all seriousness, Trek used to be an enjoyable TV series with important social commentary (not to mention entertainment value), but is now off the radar for the forseeable future.  Paramount, if you're reading this, please do the following:1. Bring in a fresh producer and fresh writers.2. Create a new series.  It doesn't have to be some mega-original idea, just something that will entertain and not INSULT the core audience.  Maybe give George Takei the opportunity he's been asking for, and create a Captain Sulu series -- this would interest the hardcore fans who have long-since tuned out.3. Give it a modest budget, and don't overkill on the merchandising.  Let the stories do the talking.  Braga says the fans have Trek ""fatigue"".  That's only partially correct -- we aren't fatigued of Trek, we're fatigued of BAD Trek.",1,Beating a dead horse,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,2751,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'decision', 'make', 'Star', 'Trek', 'prequel', 'was', 'influenced', 'way', '*Star', 'Wars*', 'prequels', 'whatever', 'reasoning', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'recent', 'cancellation', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'originally', 'just', 'titled', 'Enterprise', 'vindication', 'myself', 'others', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'feel', 'series', 'execs', 'call', 'franchise', 'long', 'lost', 'way', 'was', 'reminded', 'reasons', 'dislike', 'newer', 'Trek', 'shows', 'recently', 'when', 'tuned', 'Enterprise', 'matter', 'one', 'minute', 'heard', 'words', 'gravimetric', 'anamoly', 'Trek', 'used', 'be', 'about', 'good', 'smart', 'storytelling', 'not', 'technobabble', 'using', 'technologocial', 'deus', 'ex', 'machinas', 'solve', 'problems', 'week', 'fact', 'one', 'early', 'Star', 'Trek', 'writer', 'guides', 'states', 'grounded', 'best', 'abilities', 'science', 'episodes', 'should', 'not', 'rely', 'science', 'expense', 'storytelling', 'something', 'effect', '.While', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'good', 'Caprain', 'Archer', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'telling', 'other', 'characters', 'apart', 'was', ""n't"", 'due', 'lack', 'talent', 'skill', 'actors', 'part', 'rather', 'writing', 'matter', 'costuming', 'made', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'one', 'other', 'Then', 'whole', 'matter', 'temporal', 'cold', 'war', 'alien', 'alliance', 'looked', 'all-too', 'similar', 'seperatist', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'willingness', 'just', 'toss', 'Trek', 'continuity', 'window', ""'d"", 'like', 'thank', 'co-producer', 'scribe', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'taking', 'something', 'used', 'enjoy', 'beating', 'ground', 'Sure', 'impressive', 'worked', 'way', 'Trek', 'totem-pole', 'intern', 'co-producer', 'hooked', 'up', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'guy', 'respect', 'fan', 'base', 'made', 'Star', 'Trek', 'success', 'not', 'short-lived', 'forgotten', 'TV', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'total', 'geek', 'now', 'seriousness', 'Trek', 'used', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'TV', 'series', 'important', 'social', 'commentary', 'not', 'mention', 'entertainment', 'value', 'now', 'radar', 'forseeable', 'future', 'Paramount', ""'re"", 'reading', 'please', 'do', 'following:1', 'Bring', 'fresh', 'producer', 'fresh', 'writers.2', 'Create', 'new', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'mega-original', 'idea', 'just', 'something', 'will', 'entertain', 'not', 'INSULT', 'core', 'audience', 'Maybe', 'give', 'George', 'Takei', 'opportunity', 'been', 'asking', 'create', 'Captain', 'Sulu', 'series', 'would', 'interest', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'long-since', 'tuned', 'out.3', 'Give', 'modest', 'budget', 'do', ""n't"", 'overkill', 'merchandising', 'Let', 'stories', 'do', 'talking', 'Braga', 'fans', 'have', 'Trek', 'fatigue', 'only', 'partially', 'correct', 'are', ""n't"", 'fatigued', 'Trek', ""'re"", 'fatigued', 'BAD', 'Trek']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

Enterprise meets new friendly alien...New Alien turns out to be bad guy or still practices out dated human taboos...Enterprise tries to fix things.  The first season gets a bit long in the tooth with that formula.  It's an ok show while doing laundry.

not Star Trek's best pilot.Number 5:This is 'Enterprise''s most exciting season to me.This is a prequal to Star Trek that,at this time didn't even have those words as part of it's name-it was only called 'Enterprise'.It takes place aboard a flat starship in the mid 22'nd century with less then 80 people on board.The crew have a good chemistry but are more timid and uncertain then the brave Trek characters we've come to know,especially Scott Bakula's Captain Jonathan Archer who always seems unsure wheather to leap forward or backward.These people on 'Enterprise' live in a world without holodecks,deflector shields or even a dependable transporter.They ride around in Shuttle Pods alot and frequently where space suits.My favorite during this season?I have a couple-""Terra Nova"" because the humans seen in that show make the Enterprise crew seem LESS self doubting.The other would be ""Two Days And Two Nights"" about the first human visit to Risa and the season ends with the great shocking cliffhanger ""Shockwave"",the first one a Star Trek series included in it's first season.So at first I was a little put off by 'Broken Bow',whitch is overlong and has sections that are painfully dull but as the season progressed so did the quality.But this is about as good as this gets because in upcomming years Enterprise became incredibly tedious to the point that it had to serialize it's entire third season to keep people's attention and was ultimately cancelled.As of this writing the series finale hasn't yet aired but Enterprise has gone down as the shortest lives series in the francise since the original show in 1966,clocking in at only four seasons.This might have worked magnificantly as a miniseries or a Star Trek television movie but didn't always live up to the promise of this first year.Sadly the reality of 9/11 intruded coldly on this series pilot and in the coming years people have been glued more to the news and reality TV then good ol' Star Trek.Has Trek gotton worse?No-regular network television has and without the mass public interest to back it up this show was almost doomed from the start.So I rate this highly because of the quality FX duty done,the overall historical look of the show and the sense of continuity-not to mention that considering having little reference to go by the starship NX-01 itself is one of Trek's most clever spaceship designs and is ammong my all time favorites.Character developement and writing seem to be the fatal flaw of Enterprise at times and these episodes are as good as it gets in that department.So is this worth the investment?I say yes.",5,Setting The Record Straight!,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,2765,"['Number', '1', 'AM', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fanNumber', '2', 'WILL', 'buy', 'when',

I didn't liked it for some reason. One reason was the terrible ""Main Theme"".The Story/serie ""Enterprise"" is somewhere located between the movie ""Star Trek: The First Contact"" and the classic Serie and tells the story of the first flight to space. The captain is John Archer, played by Scott Backula.I thought I give now a new chance and buy the Blu-Ray and hey... its better than i thought (ok, the song/ main-theme is still terrible). There is a story-line through the whole season which makes for me interesting to keep my interest.Sure, one problem is (from the technical point/view) that this ""Enterprise"" looks more modern (Computer, Monitor etc.) than of Captain Kirks one but they didn't had in 1966 any computers like we have ""today"". Anyway.. that doesn't matter.Interesting are any special guests: in a recurring role can be seen Vaughn Armstrong and Jeffrey Combs (""Re-Animator"", ""From Beyond"") and other guests like Clint Howard (who appeared already as child-actor in the ""classic"" serie). Behind the camera on the directors chair are other Star Trek Veterans: Roxann Dawson, LeVar Burton, Jonathan Frakes, Robert Duncan McNeill etc.The stories are entertaining, interesting (ok, here and then are a few terrible episodes - even Brannon Braga says this in the interviews/extras).The Blu-Ray (US)-Set is CODEFREE and contains with English also German Track (inkl. a german Menu and Subtitles).This Set contains several intersting Bonus-Features:On selected episodes: Text commentaries, audio-commentariesDeleted ScnesArchive Docu/Makin-Ofs/Interviews (from the previously released DVD's)and also new Conversation between Rick Berman/Brannon Braga and Interviews (both speaking today critical abouth ""Enterprise"" and they say that they made something wrong).The Text-Commentaries (a kind of Trivias) are interesting.

889270,A3AFFR1OI77BQQ,B0007TKH66,"Bernard Clemmons III ""Soldier369""","[5, 9]","I have been a fan of Star Trek since it's inception. The original series is the benchmark by which other sci-fi series are compared. When The Next Generation was introduced I was sceptical. I watched but only when I didn't have anything else to do and remebered when it was on, there was nothing that drew me to the show. I didn't particularly like any of the characters. Picard, Riker, Data, they were good character's but even after seven years they all seemed shallow and unrealistic. Kirk, Spock, Bones were all infinitely more realistic and believable.Paramount continued after TNG with DS9 and then Voyager and the same weakness permeated those shows as well. I noticed how it became common for the crew to develope some new method of modifiying thier equipment to fix thier problem, but it always made me feel like they hadn't overcome the problem just circumvented it. The answer to every problem can't be remodulating the shield harmonics or focusing a tetryon beam through the main deflector, and yet it was, a large majority of the time.Then I saw Babylon 5 and it assumed the spot right below TOS in my list of favorite shows. It had it's problems and was weak in some points but did more of what the other Star Trek shows should have done.I have since watched Firefly and the Battlestar Galactica redux each are very good in thier own right. Firefly is particularly well done rivaling Babylon 5 in it's enjoyment value and storytelling, it's character's are on par with Kirk and his crew, it was a very good, if short lived show.Then along comes Enterprise, which I initially didn't bother watching. I was so disappointed with the other newer Star Trek series and the fact that other shows had come out and easily overshadowed them that I new Enterprise would be an abismal failure, and to a degree it was a failure. But while deployed in Iraq with the National Guard I was sent the first season but I didn't even watch it until I got home, I even managed to get my wife to watch it and the only other Sci-Fi series she has ever been able to watch was Serenity, otherwise she hates Sci-Fi altogether. But then we started watching Enterprise and not only did my wife love it but I did as well.The characters are the best I've seen portrayed in any of the series, and any of the other series I have mentioned. The stories are phenomenal. The Enterprise, internaly, is the most realistic design I've seen yet. I served in the Navy on submarines for ten years prior to joining the National Guard and the Enterprise reminded me of being on one of my old boats, right down to movie night.I don't understand why other Star Trek Fans didn't seem to like the show. I did find some weaknesses, such as the episode with the Ferengi who have, in my view, been one of the worst things introduced into the Trek Universe. They were poorly concieved and equally poorly done, I never felt that Starfleet needed an entire race of moron's to contend with.Another weakness was the episode with the Borg a race just as useless as the Ferengi but for different reasons. The Borg were introduced to Starfleet by Q which I think was the greatest mistake that was ever perpetrated on the Star Trek Universe. The Borg are senseless machines and utterly worthless as characters. There is nothing to fear, nothing to hate, nothing to immortalize them, they are like the Enterprise D and Voyager, fantastic pieces of technology but with no emotional connection.

889279,A2H8NP7I9LF6O8,B0007TKH66,BruceK,"[0, 4]","Well, way back in the 60's there was a show called ""Star Trek"".  I was a kid and it had a great affect on me in a lot of ways.  It did on many others as well too.  Movies, cartoons, books sprouted up after the show was abruptly cancelled ... probably for being too subversive.  The original series is still pretty good, if it is a little dated and simple.  Originally it was billed as an adult science fiction drama if I recall right.Well, my affection for Star Trek had me going to movies and eventually watching spin-off series, one after the other, until I just lost interest.  Most of the Next Generation shows were too staid and politically correct for me, but mostly they were dry and preachy and kind of campy even.  There was one excellent episode I think was entitled ""The Flute"" that I thought was very good.  But I lost interest and stopped caring after a while.  Then came ""Deep Space Nine"", ""Voyager"", and finally ""Enterprise"".  By the time ""Enterprise"" came along I considered it kid stuff.  When the ""Star Trek"" movie reboot showed up it was great eye candy, but it just made me mad it was so far from the original vision of Gene Roddenberry.Well ... thank to streaming video NetFlix and Amazon I have had the chance without a major investment in time and money to sample ""Enterprise"".  The first episodes of the first season were pretty much what I expected and more or less the same predictable formula of the franchise.  But a funny thing happened over time as I watched the episodes develop, the show got into a pace, and it was more raw, more honest, less politically correct, less preachy, and by the second season - damn good.The first season is good, but I almost did not keep up watching it.  Something happened in the second season, particularly with the episode ""Cogenitor"" that showed me the series had writers that were not afraid to dive into tough issues, with good writing and with class.""Enterprise"" is excellent.  Certainly it will never have the same effect on me that the original series had as a kid, but I think it is better than the original series, though not quite as comedic, it meets the criterion of an adult science fiction drama.  It's really good, and congratulations to the actors, effects makers, writers and directors for doing a f-ing excellent job of bringing Star Trek back to life.  The whole cast is great and the stories are much fun yet the stories as serious and human but still do not take themselves too seriously.  Just a wonderful experience to se this ... and my only regret is that I did not give it a chance and add to ""Enterprise's"" ratings when it was on.  This show has every indication that it had plenty of adventures to go and a lot of good ideas and thought provoking statements.As I approach the finishing of the 4th season I find myself sorry that it is coming to an end and wanting more.  I would not jump at the chance to see another Star Trek series franchise if it was anywhere as good as ""Enterprise"".

889285,ACVBZF3GK3O45,B0007TKH66,C. Davis,"[0, 1]","Bottom Line: The first two seasons are as good as any of the Star Trek franchise. The third season is very poor, but the fourth season rebounds with the exception of the final episode. Many will be disturbed by the way that this series introduces new topics into the Star Trek timeline. However, if you can get past that issue; the first two seasons are as thought provoking as any of the Star Trek TV shows. The third season, which may have been written as an artistic response to the traumatic events of 11 Sep 2001, seem downright un-Trek-like in their content. The fourth season is pretty solid, but never reaches the quality of the first two seasons.Plot issues:It is exceedingly hard to do a ""prequel"" for a franchise like Star Trek. The ""lore"" and ""background"" of the Star Trek universe is so well established that slight deviations, the first encounter with the Klingons, the Temporal Cold War, and the discovery of the Borg almost seem like emotional betrayals to even the casual fan. However, it is what it is and I would recommend that the viewer just accept the stories at face value.Third season: The whole Xendi as terrorism storyline seemed contrived and overdone. I think if Enterprise had only allowed a handful of episodes to address the 9/11 attacks vice a whole season, then it would have been much more entertaining. On a side note, I have always mocked Rodenberry's idealized take on humanity in the Star Trek universe. It was pretty sobering to see how bad the franchise could be without that as, at least, a goal that all humans strived for. Seeing the Star Trek universe give into the fear and hate that briefly consumed America after 9/11 was a bit disturbing and not in an artistically satisfying way.The thing I like best about Enterprise is the character development. All of the characters seem like real people with real flaws that influence their actions for both good and bad.CAPT Archer: He is the son of one of the men who perfected the Warp Drive. As such, he is somewhat of a golden child, handpicked to be the first Star Ship captain and promoted past his peers, most notably a girlfriend - his promotion destroys or at least delays the relationship until she also becomes a Star Ship captain - and his good friend, Trip, the ship's engineer. As another reviewer has pointed out, he is basically a good person but struggles with some real character issues. He is forced by circumstances to act in ways he finds morally repugnant but simultaneously realizes that he must put aside his resentment of Vulcans to succeed in his current role.T'Pol: She is the token Vulcan. Along with the ship's doctor, she is intended to reflect the eventual multi-species nature of Star Fleet.  After she became infected and later addicted to a neurological toxin, her emotional indulgences had a plausible storyline.  I found the storylines dealing with the correct interpretation of Vulcan philosophy to be very interesting and among some of the better episodes in the series. At some point, T'Pol permanently leaves the Vulcan High Command and becomes a permanent Star Fleet Officer.CDR Charles ""Trip"" Tucker: Trip, to this reviewer, fills the role of rambunctious swashbuckler that CAPT Kirk had in the original Star Trek. Without the expectations of command, he is free to indulge in both the worst and best aspects of his personality. In many ways, Trip is a tragic character. He loses his family when Earth is attacked. His relationship with T'Pol doesn't really amount to anything. CAPT Archer's friendship grows more formal and distant as time goes by. His devotion to the Enterprise is really the only thing this smart, friendly, and generous man has going for him.Malcolm Reed: Something just isn't right about this guy. He strikes me as the sort of person who joined Star Fleet looking for something, not realizing that the thing he was looking for was to fill the emotional void that he, perhaps, doesn't even realize is destroying his life. A smart, competent, and competitive individual,  Malcolm focuses on his work. His inability to form close and meaningful relationships is very poignant. In one episode, the Enterprise crew meets a future version of Enterprise. Malcolm realizes that he dies alone without a wife and a child.Dr. Phlox: He is the ship's doctor. An alien on earth to participate in a Vulcan multi-species physician exchange program, he is recruited to be the ship's doctor by CAPT Archer since he, unlike any Star Fleet doctor, has at least seen a Klingon, albeit a deceased one. This expertise is essential for the Enterprise's first mission. His disposition, friendly nature, and genuine interest in the crew make the stories that focus on him highly enjoyable.",4,"ENTERPRISE - MIXED BAG, BUT OVERALL VERY GOOD",1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,4716,"['Bottom', 'Line', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'third', 'season', 'very', 'poor', 'fourth', 'season', 'exception', 'final', 'episode', 'Many', 'will', 'be', 'disturbed', 'way', 'series', 'new', 'topics', 'Star', 'Trek', 'timeline', 'However', 'can', 'get', 'issue', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TV', 'shows', 'third', 'season', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'artistic', 'response', 'traumatic', 'events', '11', 'Sep', '2001', 'seem', 'downright', 'un-Trek-like', 'content', 'fourth', 'season', 'pretty', 'solid', 'never', 'quality', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.Plot', 'issues', 'exceedingly', 'hard', 'do', 'prequel', 'franchise', 'Star', 'Trek', 'lore', 'background', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'so', 'well', 'established', 'slight', 'deviations', 'first', 'encounter', 'Klingons', 'Temporal', 'Cold', 'War', 'discovery', 'Borg', 'almost', 'seem', 'emotional', 'betrayals', 'even', 'casual', 'fan', 'However', 'what', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewer', 'just', 'stories', 'face', 'value.Third', 'season', 'whole', 'Xendi', 'terrorism', 'storyline', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'overdone', 'think', 'Enterprise', 'had', 'only', 'allowed', 'handful', 'episodes', 'address', '9/11', 'attacks', 'vice', 'whole', 'season', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'side', 'note', 'have', 'always', 'mocked', 'Rodenberry', 'idealized', 'take', 'humanity', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'was', 'pretty', 'sobering', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'franchise', 'could', 'be', 'least', 'goal', 'humans', 'strived', 'Seeing', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'give', 'fear', 'hate', 'briefly', 'consumed', 'America', '9/11', 'was', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'not', 'artistically', 'satisfying', 'way.The', 'thing', 'like', 'best', 'Enterprise', 'character', 'development', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'flaws', 'influence', 'actions', 'good', 'bad.CAPT', 'Archer', 'son', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'perfected', 'Warp', 'Drive', 'such', 'somewhat', 'golden', 'child', 'handpicked', 'be', 'first', 'Star', 'Ship', 'captain', 'promoted', 'peers', 'most', 'notably', 'girlfriend', 'promotion', 'least', 'delays', 'relationship', 'also', 'Star', 'Ship', 'captain', 'good', 'friend', 'Trip', 'ship', 'engineer', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'basically', 'good', 'person', 'real', 'character', 'issues', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'act', 'ways', 'morally', 'repugnant', 'simultaneously', 'must', 'put', 'aside', 'resentment', 'Vulcans', 'succeed', 'current', ""role.T'Pol"", 'token', 'Vulcan', 'ship', 'doctor', 'intended', 'reflect', 'eventual', 'multi-species', 'nature', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'became', 'infected', 'later', 'addicted', 'neurological', 'toxin', 'emotional', 'indulgences', 'had', 'plausible', 'storyline', 'found', 'storylines', 'dealing', 'correct', 'interpretation', 'Vulcan', 'philosophy', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'better', 'episodes', 'series', 'point', ""T'Pol"", 'permanently', 'Vulcan', 'High', 'Command', 'permanent', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'Officer.CDR', 'Charles', 'Trip', 'Tucker', 'Trip', 'reviewer', 'role', 'rambunctious', 'swashbuckler', 'CAPT', 'Kirk', 'had', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'expectations', 'command', 'free', 'indulge', 'worst', 'best', 'aspects', 'personality', 'many', 'ways', 'Trip', 'tragic', 'character', 'family', 'when', 'Earth', 'attacked', 'relationship', ""T'Pol"", ""n't"", 'really', 'amount', 'anything', 'CAPT', 'Archer', 'friendship', 'more', 'formal', 'distant', 'time', 'devotion', 'Enterprise', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'smart', 'friendly', 'generous', 'man', 'going', 'him.Malcolm', 'Reed', 'Something', 'just', ""n't"", 'right', 'guy', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'joined', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'looking', 'something', 'not', 'realizing', 'thing', 'was', 'looking', 'was', 'fill', 'emotional', 'void', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'destroying', 'life', 'smart', 'competent', 'competitive', 'individual', 'Malcolm', 'work', 'inability', 'form', 'close', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'very', 'poignant', 'one', 'episode', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'future', 'version', 'Enterprise', 'Malcolm', 'alone', 'wife', 'child.Dr', 'Phlox', 'ship', 'doctor', 'alien', 'earth', 'participate', 'Vulcan', 'multi-species', 'physician', 'exchange', 'program', 'recruited', 'be', 'ship', 'doctor', 'CAPT', 'Archer', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'doctor', 'least', 'seen', 'Klingon', 'deceased', 'one', 'expertise', 'essential', 'Enterprise', 'first', 'mission', 'disposition', 'friendly', 'nature', 'genuine', 'interest', 'crew', 'make', 'stories', 'focus', 'highly', 'enjoyable']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

889288,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B0007TKH66,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[2, 3]","First off I watched Enterprise from start to finish so I was not one who tuned out. Second I thought the casting was great and the writing was excellent (as with any star trek shows there are always a few episodes that are hard to love but there are more than enough that you love outright)I think access was the main problem for most people. I am sure they went to friend's houses so as not to miss the premier but this could not be done every week (I am assuming). Luckily our cable company carried it. The other reason for lack of ratings was the fact that everyone who seemed to be criticising the show never saw the show. they were going by what others had said or what they read from critics. And anyone who is a true fan of science fiction will tell you, Most critics (though not all) have no clue what Star Trek or even Science Fiction is all about. So why listen to them? I have always been the type who read reviews but could filter out useless opinion (for instance they'd have a writer review a show like Star Trek, when they are not even A Sci Fi Fan). But, even if the review was scathing I'd still have to judge it for myself. The only thing as a fan, that I can say may have alienated some people (who do not get the priveledge to watch week to week) is that season 3 was one major story arc. I understand how that can seem a bit tired after awhile, but it was very ambitious and actually well executed, and seeing the borg episode was great as well. My only issue with the series, as I've said the cast/writing/directing were great, is that the final episode made no sense and even included old star trek stars, rather than focusing on the enterprise crew. I do not blame the writers etc for this, as I am under the impression they had little notice that they were being canceled and so they cobbled something together to give the show closure, however it just gave most fans convulsions:). I am glad that this series is getting the blu ray treatment I have bought every star trek blu ray so far, and they have done a great job. and it seems that Star Trek as a whole always does better with video releases than they do with ratings/grosses. And it's nice to see that Paramount isn't taking the easy way out and they are not only in it for the money (obviously any company would be) but they are giving the fans a great presentation of the show on enough discs (no excess compression, everything is spread out to take advantage of the blu ray's size) and they get a plethora of extras. Everything is well produced and done well. Giving Star Trek new life, and perhaps adding a new audience. While JJ Abrams may be giving a breath of fresh air to the franchise, we must remember it's these series that gave it life, Everything Roddenberry dreamed of, every hope, every wishful thought flows from the screen in each episode. Humanity may not be perfect, but when we balance the good and the bad of mankind, ultimately we find the good always outweighs the bad. And that is what Roddenberry wanted to share with us: Hope. And Enterprise does a great job and perpetuating that theme. We may not be the best we can be...but eventually we'll get there. Perhaps going where no one has gone before isn't about the exploration of new species and galaxies but about understanding ourselves and our place in that galaxy. For anyone on  the fence about buying the blu rays, my advice is to buy it now so you won't regret it later:) you won't be disappointed.I must also add that when TNG came out, everyone was rather negative yet the ratings were high. And there were a lot more rougher episodes to watch than the enterprise has (though I must add seeing tng on blu ray has made it easier to judge the series as the look/feel of the remastered video leaves the only criticism left for the actual writing/acting). Maybe now on Blu ray people can give the crew of the Enterpise a fair shot. I know a lot of people didn't like Bacula for the captain as he was in another iconic sci fi franchise, Quantum Leap and apparently you can't star in two major franchises of the same genre. Bacula makes it work though and the human way in which they all act in the beginning before starfleets regulations were formulated, is an interesting take on space travel. We are not the holier-than-thou space farers intent on protecting the galaxy, we are very human explorers who want to satiate their curiostiy and well stay alive while doing so. And they are in over their heads. Of course they tech of star trek, in going backwards, was hard to come up with, how can you simplify the communicators of TOS when in today's time frame we have smaller more technologically advanced looking cell phones? sure we can dial into space (yet) but the look of the tech now makes TOS look silly. Unless of course you view it for what it is, and now what you want it to be. which seems to be what a lot of negative sci fi fans are doing, they aren't judging the show by what it does, or what it shows, but by what it didnt' show or do that the reviewer was hoping they'd do. That's probably why Lucas sold Lucasfilm he was tired of everyone yelling at him for doing the movies the way he wanted to do them, they belong to him after all. So why not just enjoy the show for what it is rather that what our expectations had hoped they'd be. This really is an excellent series...so anyone who is on the fence I say go for it. You may see it in a different light now that it's on Blu Ray. The extras alone are a huge selling point for this set...and the series is phenomenal.",5,New beginnings on blu ray,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,5547,"['First', 'off', 'watched', 'Enterprise',

Kirk's five year voyage of the original series.This series follows the pioneering voyage of the first warp five ship in the early days of Starfleet, before the formation of the United Federation of Planets.The crew of the NX-01 led by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), consisted of the Vulcan liason/first officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), Chief Engineer Charles ""Trip"" Tucker III (The great Connor Trennier), British armory officer Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating),Communication Officer/ linguist Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), Helmsman Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), and Denoblian Chief Medical Officer Phlox (John Billingsly).At first the series was sampled by Trekkers curious about the beginnings of the Federation,which wasn't adressed until the fourth and final season.Soon viewership dwindled by it's racy tone, disregard of continuity, the fact that NX-01 looked technologically advanced to Kirk's NCC-1701,the unnessesary ""Temporal Cold War"" and it's theme song which was a AOR pop song(!!!!).The stories felt prefunctuary as to appeal to a larger audience, which was the previous Star Trek Voyager's biggest flaw.Aside from the shows fallabilities, the first season boasted great episodes in Broken Bow (the series pilot),  The Andorian Incident, Breaking the Ice, Cold Front, Dear Doctor, Shuttlepod One, and Shockwave (the season finale cliffhanger).Unfortunately,Enterprise would be a troubled production whereas the declining interest of Trek, flawed stories of the earlier seasons, and bad ratings would lead to it's cancellation in season four.The latter two seasons would find the show discovering it's tone under the guidence of Executive Producer Manny Coto.Season one may have turned off some viewers spoiled by TNG and Voyager, but would later emerge as one of the best Trek shows  since DS9",4,Enterprise Season One - The First Frontier,1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,2097,"['September', '2001', 'UPN', 'network', 'Star', 'Trek', 'producer', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'writer/producer', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'introduced', 'viewers', 'Enterprise', 'later', 'renamed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'season', 'three', '.This', 'fifth', 'live', 'action', 'series', 'franchise', 'took', 'place', 'century', 'James', 'T.', 'Kirk', 'five', 'year', 'voyage', 'original', 'series.This', 'series', 'pioneering', 'voyage', 'first', 'warp', 'five', 'ship', 'early', 'days', 'Starfleet', 'formation', 'United', 'Federation', 'Planets.The', 'crew', 'NX-01', 'led', 'Captain', 'Jonathan', 'Archer', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'consisted', 'Vulcan', 'liason/first', 'officer', ""T'Pol"", 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'Chief', 'Engineer', 'Charles', 'Trip', 'Tucker', 'III', 'great', 'Connor', 'Trennier', 'British', 'armory', 'officer', 'Malcolm', 'Reed', 'Dominic', 'Keating', 'Communication', 'Officer/', 'linguist', 'Hoshi', 'Sato', 'Linda', 'Park', 'Helmsman', 'Travis', 'Mayweather', 'Anthony', 'Montgomery', 'Denoblian', 'Chief', 'Medical', 'Officer', 'Phlox', 'John', 'Billingsly', '.At', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'sampled', 'Trekkers', 'curious', 'beginnings', 'Federation', 'was', ""n't"", 'adressed', 'fourth', 'final', 'season.Soon', 'viewership', 'dwindled', 'racy', 'tone', 'disregard', 'continuity', 'fact', 'NX-01', 'looked', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'Kirk', 'NCC-1701', 'unnessesary', 'Temporal', 'Cold', 'War', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'AOR', 'pop', 'song', '.The', 'stories', 'felt', 'prefunctuary', 'appeal', 'larger', 'audience', 'was', 'previous', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'biggest', 'flaw.Aside', 'shows', 'fallabilities', 'first', 'season', 'boasted', 'great', 'episodes', 'Broken', 'Bow', 'series', 'pilot', 'Andorian', 'Incident', 'Breaking', 'Ice', 'Cold', 'Front', 'Dear', 'Doctor', 'Shuttlepod', 'One', 'Shockwave', 'season', 'finale', 'cliffhanger', '.Unfortunately', 'Enterprise', 'would', 'be', 'troubled', 'production', 'declining', 'interest', 'Trek', 'flawed', 'stories', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'bad', 'ratings', 'would', 'lead', 'cancellation', 'season', 'four.The', 'latter', 'two', 'seasons', 'would', 'find', 'show', 'discovering', 'tone', 'guidence', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Manny', 'Coto.Season', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'viewers', 'spoiled', 'TNG', 'Voyager', 'would', 'later', 'emerge', 'one', 'best', 'Trek', 'shows', 'DS9']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

889306,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B0007TKH66,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[10, 23]","As with Voyager before, Enterprise repeated the same errors. At its core, the show had promise. With very little of early Federation days nailed down, it seemed like a good idea to go back and tell the story. But instead of sticking with some of the canon that did exist, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman rebooted the entire Star Trek franchise, which angered about 10 million viewers. Season one continued the ever increasing schism between the fans. And while I liked Bakula on Quantum Leap, he -like Kate Mulgrew before him - was woefully miscast. The supporting cast, with the exception of Jolene Blalock, showed their limitations as actors (when they got lines). The stories were mostly retreds of previous Trek episodes and while both Berman and Braga were aware of the issues of continuity, they felt that if the adhered to it too much, then the show could not work. They continued to believe that Trek viewers -at least the newer, younger ones (and, admittedly, the group advertisers like) - were only concerned about the how weird the story was and if it had half naked females parading around. This misstep by them, by fulling ignoring the fans who had watched TOS, TNG and DS9, was increasing ENT's end week by week. Paramount can be blamed also, for not stepping in sooner. Berman and Braga's now almost incestuous relationship with Trek caused then not to see the forest for the tree's. Had they realized that fan base was deeply divided, and had they analyzed who was not watching Trek anymore instead of small band who were, maybe something could've been done. Then again, maybe its doom was already sealed by the time Insurrection came out in 1998. And then there is the fan base. They too can be blamed for this, as this schism did not begin with ENT. It really started with VOY. As a network show, VOY had different standards to live up too than it's syndicated brothers, TNG and DS9. Racier plots and emphasis on action and violence became the criterion, while a device called the Temporal Reset Button was used week after week. And while TRB is a useful tool, but to rely on it for every episode got you caught in a never ending loop of Easter Peep type stories; all full of air with no substance. Plus, people who were in there teens or early 20's when TNG premiered were not 15 years older, wiser and now considered less desirable by the advertisers. ENT was, I guess, designed for the guys and girls who were the same age as the ones who saw the first season of TNG. But these new groups of kids, now brought up on a diet of science fiction being everywhere, felt Trek was a dinosaur. So all that remained, in the end, was a few really dedicated fans who felt that, yes the show was not as good as it could be, but it still needed to stay on because it was Star Trek. I will concur to a point, but that's mostly because I hate reality shows and procedural dramas that have overtaken the air waves. Give me a good science fiction story that challenges the mind, then I'll watch. I once read that science fiction is a dangerous genre, for it can be seem as anti-Christian and anti-establishment. It brings up thought provoking ideas and presents a possible world were there is no hatred, no poverty, and no religion. It's the possibilities that scare people. But even as Star Trek has framed a lot of peoples lives, such as wonderful idea of a utopian world and taught us some good values, it has entertained us for nearly 40 years. Both VOY and ENT might be considered entertaining shows, but they are NOT the next step in Star Trek's evolutionary life that TNG and DS9 were.",2,Star Trek: Voyager Redux: Enterprise,1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,3594,"['Voyager', 'Enterprise', 'repeated', 'same', 'errors', 'core', 'show', 'had', 'promise', 'very', 'little', 'early', 'Federation', 'days', 'nailed', 'down', 'seemed', 'good', 'idea', 'go', 'back', 'tell', 'story', 'instead', 'sticking', 'canon', 'did', 'exist', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'rebooted', 'entire', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'angered', '10', 'million', 'viewers', 'Season', 'one', 'continued', 'ever', 'increasing', 'schism', 'fans', 'liked', 'Bakula', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'was', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'supporting', 'cast', 'exception', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'showed', 'limitations', 'actors', 'when', 'got', 'lines', 'stories', 'were', 'mostly', 'retreds', 'previous', 'Trek', 'episodes', 'Berman', 'Braga', 'were', 'aware', 'issues', 'continuity', 'felt', 'adhered', 'too', 'much', 'then', 'show', 'could', 'not', 'work', 'continued', 'believe', 'Trek', 'viewers', '-at', 'least', 'newer', 'younger', 'ones', 'admittedly', 'group', 'advertisers', 'were', 'only', 'concerned', 'how', 'weird', 'story', 'was', 'had', 'half', 'naked', 'females', 'parading', 'around', 'misstep', 'fulling', 'ignoring', 'fans', 'who', 'had', 'watched', 'TOS', 'TNG', 'DS9', 'was', 'increasing', 'ENT', 'end', 'week', 'week', 'Paramount', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'also', 'not', 'stepping', 'sooner', 'Berman', 'Braga', 'now', 'almost', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'Trek', 'caused', 'then', 'not', 'see', 'forest', 'tree', 'Had', 'realized', 'fan', 'base', 'was', 'deeply', 'divided', 'had', 'analyzed', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'watching', 'Trek', 'anymore', 'instead', 'small', 'band', 'who', 'were', 'maybe', 'something', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'doom', 'was', 'already', 'sealed', 'time', 'Insurrection', 'came', 'out', '1998', 'then', 'fan', 'base', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'schism', 'did', 'not', 'begin', 'ENT', 'really', 'started', 'VOY', 'network', 'show', 'VOY', 'had', 'different', 'standards', 'live', 'up', 'too', 'syndicated', 'brothers', 'TNG', 'DS9', 'Racier', 'plots', 'emphasis', 'action', 'violence', 'became', 'criterion', 'device', 'called', 'Temporal', 'Reset', 'Button', 'was', 'used', 'week', 'week', 'TRB', 'useful', 'tool', 'rely', 'episode', 'got', 'caught', 'never', 'ending', 'loop', 'Easter', 'Peep', 'type', 'stories', 'full', 'air', 'substance', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'teens', 'early', '20', 'when', 'TNG', 'premiered', 'were', 'not', '15', 'years', 'older', 'wiser', 'now', 'considered', 'less', 'desirable', 'advertisers', 'ENT', 'was', 'guess', 'designed', 'guys', 'girls', 'who', 'were', 'same', 'age', 'ones', 'who', 'saw', 'first', 'season', 'TNG', 'new', 'groups', 'kids', 'now', 'brought', 'up', 'diet', 'science', 'fiction', 'being', 'everywhere', 'felt', 'Trek', 'was', 'dinosaur', 'So', 'remained', 'end', 'was', 'few', 'really', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'who', 'felt', 'yes', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'still', 'needed', 'stay', 'was', 'Star', 'Trek', 'will', 'concur', 'point', 'mostly', 'hate', 'reality', 'shows', 'procedural', 'dramas', 'have', 'overtaken', 'air', 'waves', 'Give', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'mind', 'then', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'once', 'read', 'science', 'fiction', 'dangerous', 'genre', 'can', 'be', 'seem', 'anti-Christian', 'anti-establishment', 'up', 'thought', 'provoking', 'ideas', 'possible', 'world', 'were', 'hatred', 'poverty', 'religion', 'possibilities', 'scare', 'people', 'even', 'Star', 'Trek', 'framed', 'lot', 'peoples', 'lives', 'such', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'utopian', 'world', 'taught', 'good', 'values', 'entertained', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'VOY', 'ENT', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'entertaining', 'shows', 'are', 'NOT', 'next', 'step', 'Star', 'Trek', 'evolutionary', 'life', 'TNG', 'DS9', 'were']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

I could finally see Enterprise and I have to agree with a lot of fans, this series was cancelled way before it's time.Star Trek Enterprise is a very interesting series that deals with how everything came into being, the first episode ""Broken Bow"" alone introduced how the transporter beamed its first person aboard a ship. The story is a refreshing throw back to the TOS era, seeing the return of some of the classic TOS props, but with a more updated look. To describe it, this is like TOS with a DS9 storyline. Very dark storyline with a few casual jokes thrown in, but when they do have jokes, they are hilarious! Watch Malcolm's fantasy about T'Pol on the episode ""Shuttlepod One"" for a great example, it is hilarious!The actors fit perfectly into their characters. Scott is Archer, Connor is Trip! They fit in so perfectly into their characters; I couldn't picture anyone else that could be cast in the role.Overall, this collection lived up to everything I hoped it would be, another great series that I can say that was definitely cancelled before it's time, and I heard it only gets better.

889340,A1XO58KR12PC91,B0007TKH66,"Iqbal Faizer ""Muldfeld""","[30, 69]","The latest incarnation of Star Trek devised by producers/writers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, this show promises a lot, as did Voyager, but never delivers.  These writers are so dedicated to a cynical view of what the audience wants and are so formulaic and uninventive in their approaches that this show is just as dumbed-down as Voyager, always heading toward unsuccessful action-oriented and suspenseful scenes to avoid significant character development;  and when character exploration is done, it's so awfully clich&eacute;d that it stinks of superficiality and remains unmoving.Back in 1997, Berman was quoted in TV Guide as admiring the awful ""Hercules"" series, which essentially took the ""Baywatch"" premise and added bad action sequences and worse drama.  He said he wanted Star Trek to attract that audience.  So, in that year, Voyager brought in the curvacious Jeri Ryan (who's actually a good actor) in tight-fitting clothing -- so tight she fainted at times.  This became Star Trek's new mission:  appealing to people's pornographic desires in the guise of bad stories set in space.  Even some of the actors and writers started to speak out about how uninspiring it was to work on Star Trek Voyager.This same writing/producing duo went on to create ""Enterprise"", along with a cheesy, soft-pop intro to win over the stereotypically unintelligent WB-type youth demographic.  The first episode saw them apply a disinfectant ointment on Jolene Blalock's slinky bikini-and-panty-clad body;  over the years there were so many instances of using Blalock's body, I couldn't tell you about them -- mostly because I couldn't continue watching this awful show;  the latest incarnation of which I know (since, like a hopeful fool, I gave the show another chance in season 3, when most shows get a lot better) was Blalock naked and topless holding her bosoms in hand asking another officer to massage her, while she moaned orgasmically.  This all is decent soft porn, but not what the audience should expect from ""Star Trek"".  Now, to the actor's credit, she very much resented being used like this and protested the writers' intentions.Even TNG saw a significant dumbing down in its later years, as Berman took over.  Any Star Trek story in which these two were significantly involved was always bound to stem from cynical calculations rather than the potential to write as good a story as was possible.  See, for example, all the Next Generation movies;  now, compare those to Star Trek 1 through 4, and you''ll see what I mean.Now, there is a happy ending to this depressing tale of Star Trek's decline, and that is ""Deep Space Nine"" (1993-1999), which remained largely out of these writers' grasp.  During its run, the show was mostly guided by Michael Pillar and the ingenius Ira Steven Behr, who -- along with some great writers -- always tried to make the show the best they could, and succeeded in creating something amazing by Season 4.  When action was done, it was always exciting, too, propped up by great drama, often brilliant comedy, and fantastic secondary and primary characters.(...)",1,Only because I can't give this show zero stars.,1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,3102,"['latest', 'incarnation', 'Star', 'Trek', 'devised', 'producers/writers', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'show', 'lot', 'did', 'Voyager', 'never', 'delivers', 'writers', 'are', 'so', 'dedicated', 'cynical', 'view', 'what', 'audience', 'are', 'so', 'formulaic', 'uninventive', 'approaches', 'show', 'just', 'as', 'dumbed-down', 'Voyager', 'always', 'heading', 'unsuccessful', 'action-oriented', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'avoid', 'significant', 'character', 'development', 'when', 'character', 'exploration', 'done', 'so', 'awfully', 'clich', 'eacute', 'superficiality', 'unmoving.Back', '1997', 'Berman', 'was', 'quoted', 'TV', 'Guide', 'admiring', 'awful', 'Hercules', 'series', 'essentially', 'took', 'Baywatch', 'premise', 'added', 'bad', 'action', 'sequences', 'worse', 'drama', 'said', 'wanted', 'Star', 'Trek', 'attract', 'audience', 'So', 'year', 'Voyager', 'brought', 'curvacious', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'actor', 'tight-fitting', 'clothing', 'so', 'tight', 'fainted', 'times', 'became', 'Star', 'Trek', 'new', 'mission', 'appealing', 'people', 'pornographic', 'desires', 'guise', 'bad', 'stories', 'set', 'space', 'Even', 'actors', 'writers', 'started', 'speak', 'out', 'how', 'uninspiring', 'was', 'work', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager.This', 'same', 'writing/producing', 'duo', 'went', 'create', 'Enterprise', 'cheesy', 'soft-pop', 'intro', 'win', 'stereotypically', 'unintelligent', 'WB-type', 'youth', 'demographic', 'first', 'episode', 'saw', 'apply', 'disinfectant', 'ointment', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'slinky', 'bikini-and-panty-clad', 'body', 'years', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'instances', 'using', 'Blalock', 'body', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'mostly', 'could', ""n't"", 'continue', 'watching', 'awful', 'show', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'know', 'hopeful', 'fool', 'gave', 'show', 'chance', 'season', '3', 'when', 'most', 'shows', 'get', 'lot', 'better', 'was', 'Blalock', 'naked', 'topless', 'holding', 'bosoms', 'hand', 'asking', 'officer', 'massage', 'moaned', 'orgasmically', 'decent', 'soft', 'porn', 'not', 'what', 'audience', 'should', 'expect', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Now', 'actor', 'credit', 'very', 'much', 'resented', 'being', 'used', 'protested', 'writers', 'intentions.Even', 'TNG', 'saw', 'significant', 'dumbing', 'down', 'later', 'years', 'Berman', 'took', 'over', 'Star', 'Trek', 'story', 'two', 'were', 'significantly', 'involved', 'was', 'always', 'bound', 'stem', 'cynical', 'calculations', 'rather', 'potential', 'write', 'as', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'possible', 'See', 'example', 'Next', 'Generation', 'movies', 'now', 'compare', 'Star', 'Trek', '1', '4', 'll', 'see', 'what', 'mean.Now', 'happy', 'ending', 'depressing', 'tale', 'Star', 'Trek', 'decline', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', '1993-1999', 'remained', 'largely', 'writers', 'grasp', 'run', 'show', 'was', 'mostly', 'guided', 'Michael', 'Pillar', 'ingenius', 'Ira', 'Steven', 'Behr', 'who', 'great', 'writers', 'always', 'tried', 'make', 'show', 'best', 'could', 'succeeded', 'creating', 'something', 'amazing', 'Season', '4', 'When', 'action', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'always', 'exciting', 'too', 'propped', 'up', 'great', 'drama', 'often', 'brilliant', 'comedy', 'fantastic', 'secondary', 'primary', 'characters.']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

889343,A2RPQXROPB6Z22,B0007TKH66,James A. Cole,"[12, 37]","What was the problem with enterprise? There are many opinions, but upon closer examination of the show the problem is not the choice of actors or failing ratings. Scott bakula must have been happy when he was chosen for this role and probably thought rightfully that it was the role of a lifetime after all it made William Shatner a  household name. Many people have complained that he was a wrong choice for this role, but he was perfectly suited for it. This actor , in fact all the actors that graced the small screen in enterprise were more than competent, particular Bukula.Scott bakula was an actor best known for a role he had in another TV show that was long running.  In this show he played a wide variety of roles some even female, and some in different historical settings. This would have been too much for most actors ,but Bakula  managed to succeed and hit a bulls eye constantly. Just this show alone proves Bakula is an outstanding actor that can handle any role tossed at him.John Billingley is another fine actor, pay close attention to his facial expression and mannerisms, particularly in the temporal cold war arc and in later episodes. He manages to capture the psychological portrayal of his character despite the laughable lines that come out of his mouth. The problem with enterprise lies with the writing particularly the script. The actors do an above average performance with sub- material.  Even outstanding actors cant save a sinking ship- and the enterprise was a sinking  ship, literally a sinking star ship. Without solid writing a TV show or film will not survive and prosper. Despite its expensive budget, state of the art special effects and a name brand recognized by millions, and flawless sets enterprise should have succeeded and gone where star trek didn't go before. But enterprise only managed to cause embarrassment for everyone involved  especially the actors who tried their best with the trash handed to them. They deserved better than this and we the viewers deserve better.The actors are probably going to be blamed for this shows failure maybe even vilified, but anyone with intelligence knows it wasn't their fault the enterprise sank. Without good or even average writing a TV show cant survive, this show sadly suffered from all aspects of bad writing- derivative and ill-conceived plots to a far fetched premise and down right embarrassing scripts. The actors had nothing to do with this mess, bakula and billingley are more than competent actors I  would even call them outstanding- just check their other work out .Enterprise was a  bad idea that should have never seen the light of day  or in this case the darkness of space.",1,Help!

It was too hard to try and find when it was going to be on every week.  Networks need to take note of that.But anyway, I enjoyed the show quite a bit.  I hadn't really developed too much of a connection to all the characters yet, but they seemed pretty good.  My only complaints would be that Cpt. Archer was a bit wishy washy.  Of course, when you're used to people like James T. Kirk, and Jean Luc Picard, you are looking for someone who will be ready at the drop of a hat to put their foot down.  Hmmm, maybe they wanted to try something different...  Can they do that?The Vulcan girl.  Yeah, she was a bit strange, and probably way too hot.  I can say that she had the ability to keep my eyes on the screen.  Her looks are used very liberally, like when her and a few other cast members way early in the series (maybe it was in the pilot) have to disinfect themselves, by rubbing a clear lotion all over their finely tuned starfleet bodies.  I liked it, but I sat there feeling that I shouldn't.  Make your own call.Time travel.  Urk, it's nice that they wanted to tackle some nice time travel stories, but I think that there was a lot of overkill in that area.The last little complaint is the poor continuity.

889348,A3C6R3PV0T3YMV,B0007TKH66,Jeffrey D. Messer,"[25, 32]","A lot of people slam this show. However, it was a brilliant concept and a great pilot episode. Too bad the people behind it lacked talent for execution of good ideas. They should have hired a better writing staff (like that of season four) and let them take the series where no series had gone before.And while most episodes in season one were very good, about one out of every 5 were pretty bad. Terra Nova with it's not so clever alien language morphed from English was a low point. But others were super episodes including the hailed Shuttlepod One, which was one of the best Trek episodes of all time.Out of the 26 season one episodes, at least 15 to 20 were very good, and better than the first seasons of Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, all of which took 2 to 3 seasons before the great episodes actually outweighed the bad ones in any given season.TNG had season 3 before it found it's footing. DS9 had to let Avery Brooks Hawk-ify his role before things got good. And Voyage floundered aimlessly like Battlestar Galactica 1978-lite until 7of9 came on board.  In most cases I started watching the previous series in their first season, then bailed out only to return years later when it was in syndication. Even now, I never watch reruns of seasons one two and three of any of those series when they air.But Enterprise had me at hello. I watched it from beginning to end, and never missed an episode. Sure, season two lost some focus and had too mainly aimless episodes. And season three had it's single story arc which they couldn't keep interesting for a whole season and ended up havng filler episodes to avoid showing the holes in their storytelling ability. But season four got it all right. And just like the previous series, season four was to be the real start of better things to come. But it got cancelled.People scratch their heads and wonder why it couldn't get the ratings to stay on. Yet no one recalls that all 3 previous series launched in syndication, not on UPN solely. In fact UPN launched on Voyager's back as a network, yet I watched Voyager on the local Fox network which played all Trek shows in syndication. SO ENTERPRISE was the first of the series to actually only have UPN as it's home. So less people were able to see it. Somehow people forget that.And when we talk about Trek people who slam Enterprise heap praise on the original series, which I can happily say I can't really bear to watch a full episode of. For the time, it was revolutionary, but out of that time... well, it's aweful. No doubt about it. It stinks in a modern context. But then again, I was not born until 5 years after it got cancelled, so I had no original point of entry. The first original Trek cast thing I saw was ST 4 The Voyage Home. From there I became a fan of Trek.But it is perspective. I like the New Battlestar Galactica quite a lot, but I love and adore the original which came on when I was 8. The original was a classic and will always be. Yet some of the fans of the new series who were born less than 2 decades ago, seem to have a hatred for the original, which offends me. I am sure my dislike of the original Trek offends some of those fans similarly. >But I digress.Enterprise is great Trek. But like all Trek, is flawed by often weak writing and poor executive producer mindset. But everyone knew that going in. And if they say they didn't, they are having selective amnesia. Go back and watch Seasons one of TNG, DS9 or Voyager. Then watch season one of Enterprise. Tell me which of the four has more quality episodes.  ENTERPISE.

889351,A3P9EH5DY3GEEO,B0007TKH66,J. Gower,"[1, 6]","I hate to make my review about just one thing, visual quality, but to me it was the most critical reason to upgrade from DVD to Bluray. I've had Enterprise on DVD ever since it was available, so I knew what I was getting in terms of the quality of the show itself.  I love Star Trek, so I'd feel remiss if I didn't have all of the seasons of all four shows as well as The Animated Series.I had this on preorder, so I hadn't the chance to read the reviews on sites like The Digital Bits and Bluray.com before I purchased it.  Even then, it's hard not to treat video quality subjectively, which makes it difficult for me to accept a review until I see the video with my own eyes.  With TNG, for example, the differences between the DVD and the Bluray versions were so striking I felt I was seeing the episodes the way they were meant to be seen for the first time.  Although the reviews had indicated this, until I had seen it I would never have believed how remarkable the difference was.Unfortunately, this Enteprise Bluray simply doesn't measure up to those other efforts.  The remastered TOS and TNG Blurays are vibrant, clear, and sharp.  CBS put in a remarkable effort to restore them, resulting in nearly reference-quality video that's even competitive with modern shows.  Enterprise episodes, in contrast, look soft and washed out, with muted colors and even some noise.  The blacks are flat instead of conveying a sense of deep space. In many ways, I feel like I'm watching an upscaled DVD, with many of the compression problems inherent to the older format.Perhaps I'm spoiled in this day and age, but when a closeup of an actor's face remains fuzzy, you can barely pick out individual hairs on their head, and their uniform looks dingy when it should look vibrant, I can't help but feel underwhelmed and even disappointed.As Bluray.com noted, perhaps someday they will be able to go back and give this series the treatment it deserves.

Overall I thought this was a good start to the series and I enjoyed most of the episodes on the disks.I thought the characters in the series were played well by the actors but I felt the actor who played Reed was neither the best choice nor the best acting job for the role.  I found him annoying in his defeatist demeanor and whining.  (Shuttlepod One for example)There are several storyline issues but to me the most glaring were the Temporal Cold War and the race called the Suliban.  I found it odd that the writers introduced two totally new aspects to the Star Trek saga that had never been mentioned in all of the past shows.  Wouldn't all of the other shows have brought up a past race of aliens, especially one that tried to destroy the Federation almost before it ever got started?Nevertheless I still enjoyed the episodes and had a lot of fun just watching anything related to Star Trek that was good.  I won't review each episode as so many people have done it and it would just be repetitious to do so.  I felt that overall there were more good episodes that average ones and there was only one I didn't care for. (Fusion)I did like the story line regarding the resentment of humans toward Vulcans for holding back their efforts in space travel and constantly telling them that we were not mature enough to explore the galaxy.

Many of the episodes deal with the trials and tribulations of being the first to go where no man has gone before, but after awhile the writers appeared to grow bored with all that and simply started making action episodes.

I explained away their naive and often idiotic decisions when encountering hostile aliens by the fact that they were more of the astronaught mentality, not military.

889359,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B0007TKH66,John Kwok,"[2, 2]","When television and science fiction critics have a chance to review recent science fiction television programming, I suspect that ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" will earn finally some praise as one of the better American science fiction television series ever aired. Indeed, I suspect that this series will garner more respect and praise from critics than ""Star Trek: Voyager""; the latter is quite simply the worst ""Star Trek"" series ever produced, since the quality of both its writing and acting was often far behind the best from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"". At least ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" tried to tell how humanity finally emerged from the Solar System, without relying upon Vulcan ""benevolent"" guidance, offering some compelling episodes as well as an excellent  series cast.  But clearly, the writing of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" often fell far behind the best I had seen from the first two sequel ""Star Trek"" series. For example, I agree with others who are surprised how the Vulcans were portrayed often in a less than flattering light in this series, behaving more like their distant Romulan kin, than as pacific, logical folk like Spock. And frankly, I was far from impressed with the Suliban/Temporal War series arc which finally petered out by the third season. Still, despite these reservations, I suspect that many ""Star Trek"" fans will purchase this season DVD set.I found the main characters quite likeable and interesting, most notably the dramatic trio of Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), Chief Engineer Charles ""Trip"" Tucker (Conor Trinneer) and Sub-Commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock). Without question, they most closely resembled The Original Series's Captain Kirk, Spock and Dr. McCoy, in their personalities and personal relationships. The Denobulan Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley) was yet another fascinating character too, who became the center of several superb episodes of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"".""Star Trek: Enterprise"" began on a promising note with ""Broken Bow"", introducing the Klingons to humanity, and setting the stage for further diplomatic conflict between Vulcan and Earth. One of the first season's finest episodes was ""Shadows of P'Jem"" in which Archer must contend with Vulcan duplicity and offer assistance to the Andorians, almost singlehandedly defusing a tense diplomatic conflict between both alien civlizations. This episode benefited from excellent acting from several guest stars, most notably Jeffrey Combs as the Andorian commander Shraan. Another favorite episode of mine was ""Dear Doctor"" which featured a stellar performance from John Billingsley.",4,Decent Beginnings for Star Trek: Enterprise,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2634,"['When', 'television', 'science', 'fiction', 'critics', 'have', 'chance', 'review', 'recent', 'science', 'fiction', 'television', 'programming', 'suspect', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'will', 'earn', 'finally', 'praise', 'one', 'better', 'American', 'science', 'fiction', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'aired', 'Indeed', 'suspect', 'series', 'will', 'garner', 'more', 'respect', 'praise', 'critics', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'latter', 'quite', 'simply', 'worst', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'ever', 'produced', 'quality', 'writing', 'acting', 'was', 'often', 'far', 'best', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'least', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'tried', 'tell', 'how', 'humanity', 'finally', 'emerged', 'Solar', 'System', 'relying', 'Vulcan', 'benevolent', 'guidance', 'offering', 'compelling', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'series', 'cast', 'clearly', 'writing', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'often', 'fell', 'far', 'best', 'had', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'sequel', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'example', 'agree', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'surprised', 'how', 'Vulcans', 'were', 'portrayed', 'often', 'less', 'flattering', 'light', 'series', 'behaving', 'more', 'distant', 'Romulan', 'kin', 'pacific', 'logical', 'folk', 'Spock', 'frankly', 'was', 'far', 'impressed', 'Suliban/Temporal', 'War', 'series', 'arc', 'finally', 'petered', 'out', 'third', 'season', 'Still', 'reservations', 'suspect', 'many', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'will', 'purchase', 'season', 'DVD', 'set.I', 'found', 'main', 'characters', 'quite', 'likeable', 'interesting', 'most', 'notably', 'dramatic', 'trio', 'Captain', 'Jonathan', 'Archer', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Chief', 'Engineer', 'Charles', 'Trip', 'Tucker', 'Conor', 'Trinneer', 'Sub-Commander', ""T'Pol"", 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'question', 'most', 'closely', 'resembled', 'Original', 'Series', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'personalities', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Denobulan', 'Dr.', 'Phlox', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'was', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'character', 'too', 'who', 'became', 'center', 'several', 'superb', 'episodes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'began', 'promising', 'note', 'Broken', 'Bow', 'introducing', 'Klingons', 'humanity', 'setting', 'stage', 'further', 'diplomatic', 'conflict', 'Vulcan', 'Earth', 'One', 'first', 'season', 'finest', 'episodes', 'was', 'Shadows', ""P'Jem"", 'Archer', 'must', 'contend', 'Vulcan', 'duplicity', 'offer', 'assistance', 'Andorians', 'almost', 'singlehandedly', 'defusing', 'tense', 'diplomatic', 'conflict', 'alien', 'civlizations', 'episode', 'benefited', 'excellent', 'acting', 'several', 'guest', 'stars', 'most', 'notably', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'Andorian', 'commander', 'Shraan', 'favorite', 'episode', 'mine', 'was', 'Dear', 'Doctor', 'featured', 'stellar', 'performance', 'John', 'Billingsley']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","Combining a grittier, more dangerous period of space exploration with the usual ""Trek"" optimism, the first season of ""Enterprise"" delivers an entertaining array of often-ambitious stories, likable characters, and generous special effects.  On that last point, the show doesn't cheap out when characters have to take a shuttle down to a planet (which happens almost every episode in the show's ""transporters only used as a last resort"" era) and we get to see many nicely done sequences of the crew heading to and returning from their planetside adventures.  A small point to be sure, but the detail was appreciated.More importantly, the main crew members and their interactions are entertaining and fun, again mixing unpredictability (even Vulcan science officer T'Pol often acts in ways one wouldn't expect, based on our previous experience of the stoic Vulcan race) with the expected loyalty and cameraderie we're used to seeing among previous ""Trek"" crewmen.  Also adding to the unpredictable nature of the show is the fact that the famed ""Prime Directive"" doesn't yet exist, so solutions to delicate problems are quite varied and freewheeling.Season one of ""Enterprise"" looks and sounds great on standard DVD and there are a variety of interesting extra features, along with some commentaries.

889361,AEZ55FCD5XJD6,B0007TKH66,Joseph Torcivia,"[3, 3]","Star Trek Enterprise: The Complete First Season(Released: 2005 by Paramount Home Entertainment)Another Looong DVD Review by Joe TorciviaIn the beginning, Zefram Cochrine invented Warp Drive technology.  The rest was (TV, movie, and merchandising) history!Somehow, I'd never seen STAR TREK ENTERPRISE before.  That is until an Amazon.com DVD sale proved irresistible, and I finally took the plunge.I didn't know what to expect.  What I did know is that, while I loved both STAR TREK THE ORIGINAL SERIES (""TOS"") and STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION (""TNG""- Great shows for different reasons!), each succeeding TREK series left me less and less satisfied.I liked DEEP SPACE NINE (""DS9"") less than TNG, and VOYAGER (""VOY"") less than DS9.  As VOYAGER was winding down, ENTERPRISE (""ENT"") was starting up.  Life's ups and downs notwithstanding, I was also not too eager to sample yet another TREK show that would presumably continue the downward trend.Elaborating on why I felt this way toward DS9 and VOY, I can only say that each moved further away from the ""core"" of what I thought STAR TREK should be.Both series were not about a ship (Extra points if the ship is named ""Enterprise""!) in active service to the Federation.  Yes, Voyager was a ship too, but it was (um...) ""lost in space"", full of weird characters, and wasn't nearly as much fun as was the Jupiter II.There were also too many strange aliens on these shows.  In contrast, TOS and TNG were far more relatable to us humans.  Vulcans, Klingons, and the occasional Betazoid are okay, but I really started drawing the line at regularly featured Ferengi (DS9 - I HATE Ferengi!) and the very annoying Neelix (VOY).ENTERPRISE goes back to the beginning and, much as J.J. Abrams has done in his recent feature film, starts to tell the story from the ground (Earth's ""ground"") on up.Scott Bakula, as Captain Jonathan Archer, is the perfect middle-ground between ""womanizer/ cowboy"" James T. Kirk and ""stiff-upper-lipped"" Jean Luc Picard.The crew he leads is predominantly human (Engineer Trip Tucker, Armory Officer Malcolm Reed, Navigator Travis Mayweather, and Translator Hoshi Sato), with just the right number of aliens... Vulcan Science Officer Sub-Commander T'Pol and genial Doctor Phlox (a Denobulan who is part of the ""Inter-Species-Medical-Exchange"").As this series took place a century before the original STAR TREK, efforts were made to look... not merely retro, but ""pre-retro"", if you will.  This Enterprise is small, almost cramped, compared with later models.  Try as they might, the set design crew couldn't always make this 2001 show look 100 years more primitive than its 1966 predecessor.The clothing had to step back as well.  Starfleet Admirals wore basic (but somewhat futuristically designed) military dress uniforms - and Archer and his crew wore garb that was a cross between NASA gear and the crew jumpsuits from VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.Oh, and Archer has a DOG!  A beagle named ""Porthos"".  A first for a TREK series!As is our custom in these reviews, we'll break it into CONS and PROS.The CONS:Packaging: Why is it that ALL STAR TREK SERIES have packaging that is both annoying and difficult to open and negotiate?!  The discs of STAR TREK ENTERPRISE are housed in a large ""clamshell"" pack that opens like an oversized stick of deodorant!Attached to the package with TWO DABS OF GLUE is a cardboard piece that wraps AROUND THE TOP FRONT, BACK, AND BOTTOM FRONT of the package!  You cannot open the package without removing the cardboard.  BUT, on this cardboard, is the ONLY PLACE that it is identified as being the FIRST SEASON!  So, if you remove it, nothing else on the package can distinguish it from subsequent seasons.  WHY?Menu Navigation: STAR TREK SERIES often have the most difficult, and outright noisy Menus to navigate.  Though, I must admit that the menus of ENTERPRISE are much easier to navigate than that of the Original Series. Still, it is a CON.No Skipping the End Credits:  To my surprise, I found that the EPISODE END CREDITS - the SAME end credits that Paramount routinely shrunk, squashed, and did not allow to be read in its original UPN TV broadcasts - COULD NOT BE CHAPTER-SKIPPED on it's DVDs.  Of course, I can choose to fast forward through them, if need be.  BUT... Just thought I'd share the irony, folks!The PROS:Wide Screen:  STAR TREK ENTERPRISE is the first TREK series to be filmed in wide-screen.  When played on my HD TV and upconverted via Blu-ray player, it's a delight to behold!The Episodes - with a special emphasis on the pilot:""Broken Bow"":  No Star Dates here!  This takes place in the almost-relatable year 2151!It has been 90-100 years since Cochrine's introduction of Warp Drive and travel to the distant stars is now a more a reality than a possibility.The planet Vulcan has taken notice of these early experiments, and has sent emissaries to Earth... to ""guide us"" along the correct path.  This is a SUPERB inversion of all those TOS and TNG episodes where the Federation declines or refuses to share its superior technologies with developing planetary cultures, due to the ""Prime Directive"".Resentment toward our Vulcan ""friends"" has grown, as they are suspect of holding back on technological developments and suppressing the development of Earth's Warp Program efforts.Jonathan Archer, the son of Henry Archer - an associate of Cochrine's - is selected to be captain of the just completed ""Enterprise NX-01"", a forerunner of the more familiar later USS Enterprise NCC-1701.  The Enterprise NX-01 can reach the as-of-yet unheard of speed of Warp Factor 5!  Later ships could travel at Warp 9 and above.Without spoiling too much for those who STILL haven't seen it, we have such grand moments as:The great speech about ""boldly going, etc."" that all starship captains seem to spout was actually from an historic speech by Zefram Cochrine.  The speech is played on the occasion of the launch of the Enterprise NX-01.The first human to go through a transporter. Under duress, I might add.  It was originally, not thought of for human use.  Shuttle-Pods are routinely used for transport.The introduction of the ""phase-pistol"" (with two settings ""Stun"" and ""Kill"" - nothing in between).No Deflector Shields yet.  Instead, they ""polarize the hull plating"".No phaser-weaponry that can be fired by the ship.  There are ""photon torpedoes"", but they are exactly that - torpedoes that are physically loaded as on a submarine!  ""Phase Cannons"" (the forerunner of ship phaser-weaponry) are developed during Season One.Communicators are of the good old ""flip variety"".The initial mission involves a Klingon that was pursued to Earth by hostiles unknown, and the sensitive diplomatic mission to return him to the Klingon homeworld.  Klingons were an unknown species at the time - the one was even referred to as a ""Kling-got"" by the admiral in charge.We also meet the series' new major villains: The Suliban.  This race is conducting a campaign of aggression against the Klingons and other species, taking its marching orders from a mysterious presence from ""The Future"".  This campaign, referred to as the ""Temporal Cold War"" slowly unfolds over the course of the season - and beyond.Some pilot, eh?  Now, a few other highlights...""The Andorian Incident"": Archer and crew stumble onto the ongoing hostilities between the Vulcans and the blue-skinned, antenna-ed Andorians, with unexpected revelations.  Perhaps my favorite episode of this season.""Cold Front"" Archer is surprised to find his steward hails from 900 years in the future, and is a player in the ""Temporal Cold War"".""Dear Doctor"":  A grim choice on the part of Archer and Doctor Phlox results in the first contemplations of ""The Prime Directive"" of non-interference with alien cultures.""Sleeping Dogs"" Archer and company assist the crew of a doomed Klingon ship.  They don't want the assistance.""Shuttlepod One"":  Trip and Malcolm's ordeal marooned aboard a lost shuttlepod.""Acquisition"": A boarding party of Ferengi incapacitates the crew of NX-01, and begins to loot the ship. ENTERPRISE does the impossible. A Ferengi story that I actually like!""Detained"": A militaristic society imprisons Archer and Travis in a detention camp filled with Suliban victims.""Vox Sola"": A web-like creature invades the Enterprise, takes over a cargo hold, and wraps its captured victims as would a spider!  The images of Archer and his fellow captives webbed-up are effectively disgusting.  A visual masterpiece!""Desert Crossing"": More striking scenic visuals, as a seemingly friendly desert warlord takes Archer and Trip hostage to obtain knowledge of his enemies.  Clancy Brown (""Superman the Animated Series"", ""Lost"") is a standout as the warlord.""Shockwave"": Ah, what would a modern STAR TREK series be without a season-ending cliffhanger episode!  This one reveals tantalizingly more about the ""Temporal Cold War"" and the devastating consequences for the Earth when Archer is removed from the time stream.Extra Features:Numerous features on the genesis and background of the series are included.  Scott Bakula appears in a featurette to introduce the series. Bakula is also profiled as Captain Archer.  There are also cast impressions of the season and outtakes.There is an audio commentary track for the pilot, ""Broken Bow"", with producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, and two additional pop-up ""text commentaries"" by production staffers Michael and Denise Okuda.My favorite feature is: ""Star Trek Time Travel: Temporal Cold Wars and Beyond"".  The ""Temporal Cold War"" of ENTERPRISE is examined, along with all other notable instances of time travel that occurred in the various TREK series and films.Overall:I'm sorry I missed STAR TREK ENTERPRISE in its original 2001-2005 run. From this first season - and what I've seen of the second season thus far - it is severely underrated, likely from its having come along at a time when the mass audience (myself included) was suffering a prolonged case of ""Trek Fatigue"".If you are so inclined, give it a chance.

I was excited to see how the Federation and Starfleet first developed and what happened soon after the discovery of warp drive. But the show didn't deliver on those promises in the first season.I could (possibly) have forgiven all glaring inconsistencies about the ship's naming and the technology, the bland crew, and the 'Patch Adams' theme song if - IF - the NX-01 hadn't started off by meeting alien races that were not discovered until centuries later. Picard encountered the Borg first? Nope, Archer. Ferengi? Archer. And on and on and on. That was not only flagrant, unnecessary retconning, it was totally against the (alleged) premise and promise of ENTERPRISE: They missed so much opportunity to show how the charter Federation members were discovered and eventually allied with. A virtual warehouse of cultures to explore and flesh out and they pick ones from the TNG era that have been done to death? That was the last straw for me.I understand they finally got around to doing this when the show was in its death throes but I wasn't around to enjoy it by then.Exploring the charter races, I mean.Well, the death throes, too.",1,"Should have been called ""Star Trek: Retconiverse""",1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,1173,"['tried', 'give', 'ENTERPRISE', 'chance', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'how', 'Federation', 'Starfleet', 'first', 'developed', 'what', 'happened', 'soon', 'discovery', 'warp', 'drive', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'promises', 'first', 'season.I', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'forgiven', 'glaring', 'inconsistencies', 'ship', 'naming', 'technology', 'bland', 'crew', ""'Patch"", 'Adams', 'theme', 'song', 'IF', 'NX-01', 'had', ""n't"", 'started', 'off', 'meeting', 'alien', 'races', 'were', 'not', 'discovered', 'centuries', 'later', 'Picard', 'encountered', 'Borg', 'first', 'Nope', 'Archer', 'Ferengi', 'Archer', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'flagrant', 'unnecessary', 'retconning', 'was', 'totally', 'alleged', 'premise', 'promise', 'ENTERPRISE', 'missed', 'so', 'much', 'opportunity', 'show', 'how', 'charter', 'Federation', 'members', 'were', 'discovered', 'eventually', 'allied', 'virtual', 'warehouse', 'cultures', 'explore', 'flesh', 'out', 'pick', 'ones', 'TNG', 'era', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'was', 'last', 'straw', 'me.I', 'understand', 'finally', 'got', 'doing', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'death', 'throes', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'enjoy', 'then.Exploring', 'charter', 'races', 'mean.Well', 'death', 'throes', 'too']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

889365,A10872FHIJAKKD,B0007TKH66,Just Bill,"[1, 3]","I have to admit that when Enterprise first aired in the early 2000s, I didn't watch a single episode. I remember thinking at the time, ""How awful will this be? Scott Bakula? A prequel? Ugh.""My loss. Big time.Because I have Amazon Prime, I'm able to watch all of the Star Trek series free. On a lark, my wife and I started Enterprise.At first, the theme song turned us off. It sounded...well...weird. Out of place. Not in keeping with Star Trek.But it grew on us. We actually like it now.Then there are the characters: Captain Archer, T'Pol, Trip, Malcom, Hoshi, Phlox, and Travis. At first, we thought, what a motley crew. A bunch of odd balls. Just normal people, really. We thought Trip sounded like someone doing a George Bush impression. And we thought T'Pol was hot in her chesty jumpsuits, but hardly a Vulcan as we've come to know them.But they grew on us.Then we started getting into the stories, as clunky and as cheesy as they seemed to be. They grew on us.We watched all four seasons and absolutely fell in love with Star Trek: Enterprise, as it came to be called. We feel closer to these characters than any other Star Trek series. And that's saying a lot. I grew up watching the original series with Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and others. My wife loved Next Gen and thought Picard was a hunk.For whatever reason, we now think Enterprise is our favorite of the Star Treks. I know that sounds nearly blasphemous. But it's true. Enterprise is a truly wonderful series that didn't last long enough. The characters, for all their quirks and human foibles (except for the non-humans, that is) seemed REAL. They seemed to be earnest, and wide-eyed, and sincere. They seemed like nice people. No pretense.Season One gets off to a rocky start. Takes a bit to get into the show. But stick with it.Season Two is our favorite season. That really rocked. Great stories. Nice character development.Season Three is our least favorite season. Way too much about the Xindi. The entire season is one big story arc about something we just couldn't get into. This is why we think the series started to nose dive in the ratings. If you miss an episode or two in Season Three you're lost.Season Four is back to Season Two levels...except for that horrendous last episode. We agree with others: Berman and Braga ought to be flogged for the way they treated Enterprise.The only thing stopped me from buying Enterprise on Blu-ray is the price. This is way overpriced for what it is. If it dips to around $60, we may take the plunge. But we're not paying $75 for six Blu-rays.If you've ever thought of taking a chance on Star Trek: Enterprise, I wholeheartedly recommend you do so. We fell in love with this series. Maybe you will, too.",4,Fell In Love With This Series...but what's with the price?!?!?!,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,2716,"['have', 'admit', 'when', 'Enterprise', 'first', 'aired', 'early', '2000s', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'single', 'episode', 'remember', 'thinking', 'time', 'How', 'awful', 'will', 'be', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'prequel', 'Ugh', 'loss', 'Big', 'time.Because', 'have', 'Amazon', 'Prime', ""'m"", 'able', 'watch', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'free', 'lark', 'wife', 'started', 'Enterprise.At', 'first', 'theme', 'song', 'turned', 'off', 'sounded', 'well', 'weird', 'place', 'Not', 'keeping', 'Star', 'Trek.But', 'grew', 'actually', 'are', 'characters', 'Captain', 'Archer', ""T'Pol"", 'Trip', 'Malcom', 'Hoshi', 'Phlox', 'Travis', 'first', 'thought', 'what', 'motley', 'crew', 'bunch', 'odd', 'balls', 'Just', 'normal', 'people', 'really', 'thought', 'Trip', 'sounded', 'someone', 'doing', 'George', 'Bush', 'impression', 'thought', ""T'Pol"", 'was', 'hot', 'chesty', 'jumpsuits', 'hardly', 'Vulcan', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'them.But', 'grew', 'started', 'getting', 'stories', 'clunky', 'as', 'cheesy', 'seemed', 'be', 'grew', 'us.We', 'watched', 'four', 'seasons', 'absolutely', 'fell', 'love', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'came', 'be', 'called', 'feel', 'closer', 'characters', 'other', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'saying', 'lot', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'original', 'series', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'McCoy', 'others', 'wife', 'loved', 'Next', 'Gen', 'thought', 'Picard', 'was', 'hunk.For', 'reason', 'now', 'think', 'Enterprise', 'favorite', 'Star', 'Treks', 'know', 'nearly', 'blasphemous', 'true', 'Enterprise', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'enough', 'characters', 'quirks', 'human', 'foibles', 'non-humans', 'seemed', 'REAL', 'seemed', 'be', 'earnest', 'wide-eyed', 'sincere', 'seemed', 'like', 'nice', 'people', 'pretense.Season', 'One', 'rocky', 'start', 'bit', 'get', 'show', 'stick', 'it.Season', 'Two', 'favorite', 'season', 'really', 'rocked', 'Great', 'stories', 'Nice', 'character', 'development.Season', 'Three', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'Way', 'too', 'much', 'Xindi', 'entire', 'season', 'one', 'big', 'story', 'arc', 'something', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'think', 'series', 'started', 'nose', 'dive', 'ratings', 'miss', 'episode', 'two', 'Season', 'Three', ""'re"", 'lost.Season', 'Four', 'back', 'Season', 'Two', 'levels', 'horrendous', 'last', 'episode', 'agree', 'others', 'Berman', 'Braga', 'ought', 'be', 'flogged', 'way', 'treated', 'Enterprise.The', 'only', 'thing', 'stopped', 'buying', 'Enterprise', 'Blu-ray', 'price', 'way', 'overpriced', 'what', '60', 'may', 'take', 'plunge', ""'re"", 'not', 'paying', '75', 'six', 'Blu-rays.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'thought', 'taking', 'chance', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'do', 'so', 'fell', 'love', 'series', 'Maybe', 'will', 'too']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

Even though I have problems with some of the story arcs, nevertheless I think it's better than both ""Next-Gen"" and ""Voyager,"" good though these were (TOS and DS-9 being favorites).I must admit being a bit befuddled and dismayed by the show's early departure from the established history of the Trek universe; I had hoped we would get to see the formation of the Federation and be allowed to view the genesis of the Federation's conflicts with the Klingons and Romulans. Instead, we were shown a temporal cold-war and the Xindi story arc (if Earth was really devastated by a Xindi attack why did Spock never reference this important bit of history in TOS?). The Xindi arc was well done and I liked it, but it was a diversion from established Trek history.I did think the main characters evolved nicely over the course of the show, particularly Archer and T'Pol-they took her character to some very interesting places.  Having Lt. Reed's operative status ""recativated"" was also a nice character revelation.I'm just sorry it took four seasons for Manny Coto and Judith Reeves-Stevens to come on board. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens (authors of some of the best Trek novels) should have been scripting plots from day one, instead of coming aboard only in the fourth season; they know the Trek universe better than the producers themselves. They could also have utilized other great Trek authors such as Keith R. A. DeCandido, Greg Cox and SA Perry.Though each season had its share of very memorable shows, season four is by far the best, as it got back on track exploring TOS prehistory. Finally, the explanation for the marked differences between the Klingon's of TOS' era and those of the movies/ Picard's time! We were also shown the basis for the antagonism between the Andorians and Tellarites. The two-parter ""In a Mirror Darkly"" was nothing short of amazing! In this episode we get to see the mirror universe Enterprise crew aboard the USS Defiant, one of twelve Consitution Class ships, and sister to Kirk's Enterprise (the Defiant was drawn into ""interspace"" in the award-winning TOS episode ""The Tholian Web"" and lost with all hands). Seeing the alterate Enterprise crew aboard the Defiant was awesome. The produces of Enterprise did a masterful job of recreating TOS starship sets. Seeing what the Tholians actually look like from the neck down was nice as well, although the sense of mystery regarding their full appearance which had been maintained heretofore was kind of nice. And as I said, it was also nice to see Lt. Reed as a covert intel agent in season four.All-in-all Enterprise was a very worthy addition to the Trek universe; had it not been cancelled prematurely it could have truly gone where no man has gone before.Live long and prosper.",4,A Show that Should Have Lived Long and Prospered,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,2799,"['rated', 'show', 'four', 'stars', 'Even', 'have', 'problems', 'story', 'arcs', 'nevertheless', 'think', 'better', 'Next-Gen', 'Voyager', 'good', 'were', 'TOS', 'DS-9', 'being', 'favorites', '.I', 'must', 'admit', 'being', 'bit', 'befuddled', 'dismayed', 'show', 'early', 'departure', 'established', 'history', 'Trek', 'universe', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'get', 'see', 'formation', 'Federation', 'be', 'allowed', 'view', 'genesis', 'Federation', 'conflicts', 'Klingons', 'Romulans', 'Instead', 'were', 'shown', 'temporal', 'cold-war', 'Xindi', 'story', 'arc', 'Earth', 'was', 'really', 'devastated', 'Xindi', 'attack', 'why', 'did', 'Spock', 'never', 'reference', 'important', 'bit', 'history', 'TOS', 'Xindi', 'arc', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'liked', 'was', 'diversion', 'established', 'Trek', 'history.I', 'did', 'think', 'main', 'characters', 'evolved', 'nicely', 'course', 'show', 'particularly', ""T'Pol-they"", 'took', 'character', 'very', 'interesting', 'places', 'Having', 'Lt.', 'Reed', 'operative', 'status', 'recativated', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'character', 'revelation.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'sorry', 'took', 'four', 'seasons', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'Judith', 'Reeves-Stevens', 'come', 'board', 'Judith', 'Garfield', 'Reeves-Stevens', 'authors', 'best', 'Trek', 'novels', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'scripting', 'plots', 'day', 'one', 'instead', 'coming', 'only', 'fourth', 'season', 'know', 'Trek', 'universe', 'better', 'producers', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'utilized', 'other', 'great', 'Trek', 'authors', 'such', 'Keith', 'R.', 'A.', 'DeCandido', 'Greg', 'Cox', 'SA', 'Perry.Though', 'season', 'had', 'share', 'very', 'memorable', 'shows', 'season', 'four', 'far', 'best', 'got', 'back', 'track', 'exploring', 'TOS', 'prehistory', 'Finally', 'explanation', 'marked', 'differences', 'Klingon', 'TOS', 'era', 'movies/', 'Picard', 'time', 'were', 'also', 'shown', 'basis', 'antagonism', 'Andorians', 'Tellarites', 'two-parter', 'Mirror', 'Darkly', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'episode', 'get', 'see', 'mirror', 'universe', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'USS', 'Defiant', 'one', 'twelve', 'Consitution', 'Class', 'ships', 'sister', 'Kirk', 'Enterprise', 'Defiant', 'was', 'drawn', 'interspace', 'award-winning', 'TOS', 'episode', 'Tholian', 'Web', 'lost', 'hands', 'Seeing', 'alterate', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'Defiant', 'was', 'awesome', 'produces', 'Enterprise', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'recreating', 'TOS', 'starship', 'sets', 'Seeing', 'what', 'Tholians', 'actually', 'look', 'neck', 'down', 'was', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'sense', 'mystery', 'regarding', 'full', 'appearance', 'had', 'been', 'maintained', 'heretofore', 'was', 'kind', 'nice', 'said', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Lt.', 'Reed', 'covert', 'intel', 'agent', 'season', 'four.All-in-all', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'very', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Trek', 'universe', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'cancelled', 'prematurely', 'could', 'have', 'truly', 'gone', 'where', 'man', 'gone', 'before.Live', 'long', 'prosper']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

The concept was bold - although not original - and it had a great time to be started at the turn of the 21st century - however - the show show lacked some basic elements.It lacked interesting characters. Even with a very talented performer like Scott Bakula - without a good script, it just doesn't happen. I feel sorry for Scott and have heard that he and Conner Trinneer both campaigned for a new direction for their characters.The first season tried its best to flesh out the intrigue but failed in the story arcs. Rick Berman and Brannon Braga killed the series by making it a REAL Soap Opera. (The only thing missing was the Sappy music!)The show didn't focus on characters or story at all. by the end of the second season - it was apaprent no one was watching and in fact - it was cancelled twice.Star Trek needs a rest from TV to gain new life and definately NEW blood onthe production side. I am said to see no new Trek, but Berman followed his legacy by killing the Movie franchise and creating ""Nemesis"" and ""Insurrection"" - thereby killing the movie Trek relm as well.The only reason I gave it a 2 at all was because of its technical achievements.

I had high hopes for Enterprise; I haven't seen a Star Trek that I really enjoyed since The Next Generation went off the air, and the idea of a lower-tech, and hopefully more gutsy and engaging, Star Trek was appealing.Unfortunately much of Enterprise is the same tired material that has been done and re-done in all the shows that came before it. Like the original, there is a Vulcan Science Officer. Like Voyager, Enterprise insists on having a ridiculously cat-suited female prancing around. This is made more ludicrous by the fact that she is T'Pol, a Vulcan...is it really logical to wear something so skin-tight that mobility is at stake?The crew of this first Enterprise face the same situations that the crews of subsequent ships have faced for hundreds and hundreds of episodes; I'm not saying that these situations aren't sometimes interesting and even creative (an unexpected development with Tripp in ""Unexpected"" was delightful) but really, how many times can a captain almost-instantly pacify races who have been archenemies for hundreds of years before it gets tired? How many defiant and/or motivational speeches and words of encouragement can he give before we realize he's some sort of strange hybrid of Captains Picard, Kirk, AND Janeway?Much of the show's watchability comes from what it doesn't have: high technology, people beaming in and out constantly, etc. It's interesting to watch how the crew of this ship make do without what we've come to see as standard Starfleet equipment: shields, force fields, transporters, and the like.All in all, if you're a Trekkie you might enjoy Enterprise; you might not. Personally I miss the refined class of Captain Picard and the TNG crew; this show rarely achieves the depth of that series, while retaining all its preachiness - which is, by the way, the single most annoying aspect of the show. We've heard enough about racial tensions and unfair treatment and peace treaties and the like on ALL the other series; it would have been nice to have a show not quite so high-minded and preachy in its philosophy.

I only watched the pilot and the following episode and to me the whole thing seemed up-converted, and I mean every scene and not only the special effects which were originally rendered in standard definition. If you rate the Next Generation Blu-rays 10 and Enterprise DVDs 5, the Enterprise Blu-rays would be at best 5.5.I only hope that Paramount didn't do it intentionally so they have an excuse not to release Deep Space Nine and Voyager when the Enterprise Blu-rays don't sell as much as the classic series or TNG.So if you're planning on buying this I'd suggest that you rent it first and find for yourself if it's worth the purchase. I gave this review 2 stars in respect for the show, which I really like, but the quality of the image, especially if you consider the other Star Trek shows already released on Blu-ray, is insulting.-------------------UPDATE-------------------Following the suggestion of another customer, I checked another episode further ahead, and although the picture does improve, I'd give it a 7.5, which doesn't come near the results they had on TOS or TNG, so I still humbly maintain that it isn't worth the upgrade unless you are really interested in the new extras or if you have money to burn.

889399,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0007TKH66,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[78, 96]","Following the success of four live-action TV series and ten feature-length films, producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga attempted to create a fifth live-action ""Star Trek"" series that would be set approximately 100 years prior to the time of Captain Kirk (during the original ""Star Trek"" series, which ran between 1966 and 1969) and 100 years after the fictional character Dr. Zefram Cochrane flew the first warp-capable spaceship, as depicted in the 1996 film ""Star Trek VIII: First Contact"".The new series, entitled ""Star Trek Enterprise"" debuted in the fall of 2001, only months after the previous ""Star Trek"" series, ""Star Trek Voyager"" concluded its seven-year run.  The show's series premiere, entitled ""Broken Bow"", began with the appearance of a Klingon on Earth following a mishap long before the formation of the United Federation of Planets.  To return the Klingon back to his home world, Capt. Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula, formerly the lead actor of the sci-fi TV show ""Quantum Leap"", that ran between 1989-1993), gets permission from Starfleet to take the experimental starship named Enterprise, with serial number NX-01, to Kronos, in spite of the misgivings from Vulcans, who don't believe that mankind is sufficiently prepared to begin exploring other worlds and encounter more alien species.  The NX-01 is the first man-made starship capable of traveling at a speed of warp 5.  Capt. Archer then assembles the rest of his crew for the new Enterprise, including the non-human Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), the Vulcan Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalok), Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating), Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) and Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker III (Connor Trinneer).  With over 12,000,000 viewers watching the premiere episode, it initially appeared that UPN, which broadcasted the show, would have another successful ""Star Trek"" series, just as it had with ""Star Trek Voyager"".  Unfortunately, subsequently shows had much smaller audiences that only continued to shrink with each season. The average number of viewers per episode for the first season was about 6.7 million; for the second season, this number dropped to 4.4 million and for the third season, the number dropped further to 3.8 million.  It was during the fourth season that UPN decided to cancel the series, even though there were still another three seasons to be produced because the fourth season ratings dropped even further to 3.1 million viewers per episode.The question, then, is why did ""Star Trek Enterprise"" fail to capture the attention of the estimated 30,000,000 ""Star Trek"" fans living in the U.S.A.?  Personally, I believe several factors are responsible.  First, the only truly interesting characters were Dr. Phlox and T'Pol.  The characters of Reed and Trip were often annoying.  However, the most annoying character during the first season was Capt. Archer himself, who repeatedly acted like an arrogant uninvited guest towards every alien species and outpost encountered.  Second, the inclusion of the previously unknown species called the Suliban and the notion of a ""temporal cold war"" from the far distant future ran tangent to the notion that ""Enterprise"" was supposed to be a prequel leading up to the time of Capt. Kirk.  Third, the technology and overall look of the NX-01 often appeared more advanced than what was used in the original 1966-1969 ""Star Trek"" series, which is supposed to be 100 years more advanced than ""Enterprise"".  Fourth, insufficient attention was given to portraying the various extraterrestrial races responsible for for forming the United Federation of Planets: the Vulcans, the Andorians, the Tellarites, and the Alpha Centauris; as well as to other races known during Capt. Kirk's time.  Though the Vulcans were a frequent race depicted in the first season of ""Enterprise"", the only other future founding race of the United Federation of Planets were the Andorians, which appeared in only two first-season episodes: ""The Andorian Incident"" and ""Shadows of P'Jem"".  The blame for these various factors that directly contributed to the premature cancellation of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" rests solely with producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.  Unfortunately, the addition of producer Manny Coto who did an amazing job of reconnected the fourth season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" to the rest of the ""Star Trek"" TV series came too late to save the show.Of the 26 episodes the comprise the first season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"", the most memorable were ""Broken Arrow"", ""Fight or Flight"", ""Strange New World"", ""Unexpected"", ""Terra Nova"", ""The Andorian Incident"", ""Breaking the Ice"", ""Civilization"", ""Fortunate Son"", ""Silent Enemy"", ""Dear Doctor"" (one of the best first-season episodes), ""Sleeping Dogs"", ""Shadows of P'Jem"", ""Oasis"", ""Two Days and Two Nights"" and season finale ""Shockwave, Part 1"".  One disappointing episode was ""Fusion"", which appeared to contradict descriptions from other ""Star Trek"" TV series that Vulcans had always practiced mind melds; as was the episode ""Acquisition"", which included the Ferengi: a species that had only been introduced in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", 200 years later.Overall, I rate the first season of ""Star Trek Enterprise"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was an interesting experiment that had it been given more time, probably would have blossomed into a far better series thanks to the efforts of Manny Coto.",4,"The ""Star Trek"" Prequel That Failed

The writing always seemed to be finding it's way and often times, it was slow and daunting to keep interest.  I can now years later be more kinder to watching it.  But after Voyager, it was just a engine that had run out of steam.  The first 2 seasons was like a slow loving train that was in search of it's way.  Thankfully season 3 began to get good and season 4 rocked it hard!

Lamoglia ""Nostalgic Lamoglia""","[2, 14]","For me to actually sit here and type a review can only mean one thing:1) I absolutely LOVE something and want total strangers on the net to know, or2) I HAVE to warn people about pending disaster, hate, evil, or if they are about to step into doodoo.I speak not to the star trek aficionado, who will watch trek, any trek, as long as it IS trek. There will be hate, love, discussion, anger, happiness, etc amongst us who are of the trek. There is no point in telling any of us what we already know, that this show stinks.........I am directing this to the innocent fool who never really got into star trek, but is curious of what this series has to offer. With the advent of the new hack and slash, ""let's attract as many people as we can to the franchise and give the finger to the fans"", movies that are coming out, many are probably skimming amazon to learn and digest more trek, at least I hope. If this is you, and you are reading this, immediately search for star trek deep space nine and buy that.Listen to me, and listen carefully. Star Trek Enterprise was a prequel (and I probably need not say more) that was conceived by Satan and his disciple, namely Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. These two animals took an incredible series (or franchise as the bankers call it) and destroyed what once was magnificent social commentary set in space. This show stinks. Why? Well read the 1 star ratings and find out! Oh you won't? Why? Because you feel that those who gave it a 1 star are cynical, evil dwarves who just want to hate? Maybe. But the truth is, It really is poorly done.Where do I begin?Why rehash what we already know, and disrupt canon, when you could easily have explored the birth of the federation and its' member species. You want conflict? Well let there be conflict between these, instead of bringing in the romulans, the borg (!) etc.Ira Steven Behr and Michael Piller (from ds9 and tng as well for Piller) is what is needed once again. Why won't the studio fund a 3 part mini series on the events following the dominion war to see if anyone will watch? I guarantee there will be interest. People don't like prequals (doesn't take a genius to realize this) but they do like continuity, character development, etc. Let's put it this way. The show Dallas has been off the air for umpteen years, and they just brought it back, same characters and a few new ones, to critical acclaim! What does this tell you? We want more of what we love. We want to see familiar faces. We want what works.I can go on and on, but my fingers hurt and I'm feeling sick thinking about Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.

In both cases the first disc had a clear glue like sticky coating completely covering the printed side of the disc. It would stick right to your hand. Every other disc in the package was fine and did not have this issue. It leads me to believe that someone at the manufacturing plant must have run off an entire batch of bad first discs. I am writing this to warn buyers of what they may experience. Thankfully Amazon was willing to help with this issue, and allowed me to return the defective sets. I already purchased season 2 and it had no such problem.

889408,ACTHUAU2A70DF,B0007TKH66,"M. Sharpless ""NERV""","[4, 4]","I am bringing this review over from the DVDs.  It still holds true!This is a long time coming, and I know there is already a ton of reviews for this series. I just have to give my take on this series just too kind of cleanse my soul after watching it for the second time.Broken Bow was the start of the series, and it had a lot of promise and it gave me so much hope for the show. Who wouldn't want to see the missions before the Original Trek Crew of Kirk and Spock? In this episode we see the Klingons for the first time in the Trek universe and to any fan of Star Trek you immediately notice something that most casual fans might not. So it starts to make you think about the possibilities of what could have happened. It was a great time to be a Trek fan.Season One started out strong and for the most part was a great first step in building the Trek universe, That said Season two was dragged down by time travel, too much was used to try and explain things. It was unnecessary and a cheap way to explain things. In my opinion it brought the show down and ruined what could have been an outstanding show. The second season turns Enterprise into an acceptable TV drama that was to busy trying to confuse everyone.Season two brought more time travel into the mix with trying to expand the ""Temporal Cold War"". Season one had the ""Temporal Cold War"" and if you didn't get it by the end of season one, season two and three throw it in your face every time they can. It really cheapens the Trek universe and it reveals too much to Captain Archer. Even with all the future information given to him you wonder why he makes some of the decisions he makes knowing full well what would happen if he just did it another way. With the information given to Captain Archer about the Federation being formed you feel as if it deprives you and him of the experience of creating it. There was no need for time travel in this show. Season two was were a lot of the fans left the show on to better things.If Season two was not enough to make you turn it off, Season three was another good reason to do so. As with season two and one the ""Temporal Cold War"" plays a big role with the Xindi learning of how Earth is going to destroy their home world from another faction of the Cold War feeding the Xindi lies. This in an attempt to destroy humans so the other species manipulating the Xindi could eventually take over the known universe. So you guessed it, more time travel and more nonsense. The Season starts off with the Xindi sending a massive weapon of mass destruction to Earth which ends up killing 7 million people. So humans and Enterprise has to go to ""The Expanse"" to find the Xindi and stop them from completing an even bigger weapon that would destroy Earth in one blow. This Season also tries to strengthen a romance that you feel was developing slightly in the First and Second seasons. The season ends with Enterprise being thrown back into time. Once again you're left wondering if they will just let the ""Cold War"" die and get back to being Star Trek!!If you managed to stick with the show you're finally made it to the best part of what unfortunately became the last season of this show. It started out weak with the whole time travel thing, but they finally stopped the nonsense with time travel and focused on what was important. It got the series back on track, and featured more of the aliens we have come to know. The first part started off with the Augments and even has a reference to the ""Botany Bay"" and ""KHAN""! The show also started to explain the Klingon disease that changed their appearance to what we saw in the Original Show with Kirk. This Fourth season was what we craved the show to be from the start and it was delivering on so many levels only to destroy you in the finial episode.The last episode is what makes people cringe with fear when they watch this show. They know what's coming. I for one hated the last episode as it basically makes you feel the whole experience was a joke from the start. Was it real or all fake? The little joke they had going though the whole series about a chief which you never see until now makes you wonder was it all worth it. The last episode cheapens what the whole cast had worked for and basically turned it into a half baked Star Trek ""The Next Generation"" episode.A few things could have been changed and this episode would have been great! Change one would be get rid of the TNG cast and all references to TNG. Let it be about Enterprise and not William Riker! Don't kill off an awesome character that everyone agrees is one of the best in the show for no reason. This was done just to make fans talk, and it was senseless, there was no point in the killing and it seemed so forced like it was a joke to the writers. Lastly show the speech we all wanted to see. Why was this never shown? It was start of the federation, the speech that made it comes into being and nothing was shown. If you took out all the worthless TNG crap they would have had plenty of time to show the speech. Besides that it was an ok episode and I understood what they were trying to do, but it failed miserably. ( I really believe if you just take out the one death, everyone would be happy with this episode, it would not make it so hated like it is. Still a bad episode but that one death thows it over the top of being bad).Besides the last episode and the clunky 2nd and 3rd season, this is a great show. The fourth season really does hit a home run, and it's too bad they canceled it. I hope they could do something in the future with Star Trek. It's like something has been missing for so long from TV and it needs to come back in the ""Original Time Line"". Maybe the first episode should try and fix the damage done to Enterprise with another holodeck recreation of the 'Real Events"". Having said how badly this show ends, I would still recommend this show to Trek Fans. It's a great show and it was enjoyable to watch twice though.Update:I got the Blu-Ray and I am not blown away by the picture, but I am very happy. I never really owned the real DVD set so(I bought my DVD's in Afghanistan, so what I really have is a Ripped version of the show. :-), I thought it was about time I buy the show in a proper format.First, I would like everyone to understand the reason why the first season of ""Enterprise"" is not up to picture quality like ""The Original Star Trek"" or ""The Next Generation"". This is not a remaster of ""Enterprise"". This is simply a transfer of the original film to blu-ray disk. I am not the only one to realize this, Blu-Ray.com does not really talk about this, but another review does. Read the Digitalbits review it's very spot on!!The picture is an upgrade over the DVD's, but its not a huge upgrade. If you are like me and have not bought the DVDs yet, than this is the set you want. You will not be disappointed in the quality. The first episode was the worse picture out the whole season, but it did get better along the way. I believe this is due to the fact that the show was filmed when HD was still very young. On the plus side it's the first Star Trek filmed in Widescreen.The sound is not great, but it is 5.1 and it's an upgrade over the DVD's. The best thing about ""Enterprise"" on blu-ray is the special features. Words can not express the amount of extra's you get on this Blu-Ray. The extras alone prove how much love CBS put into this Blu-Ray set. If you think CBS is taking your money for a substandard blu-ray than the Special Features prove you wrong. All of the DVD extras and even the Best Buy Extras are presented here, plus a few new ones that will blow you away on the amount of information given on why the show was not what it could have been.Overall the score for this release is a solid 8 out of 10 for me. The picture could have been remastered, but I understand the reason why it was not. The picture was state of the art back in 2001 but today it does not hold up. The sound is good but could have been great. Despite the little problems ""Enterprise"" on blu-ray comes warping out of space dock onto your TV in a great package and is a overall great value.",4,These Are the Voyages!!

Naturally, I began with season 1 of the prequel series Enterprise.Captain Johnathan Archer (note, JOHN Archer, JIM Kirk, JEAN-LUC Picard, and Kathrin JANEWAY), son of Zephram Cocraine's pal and fellow warp engineer, and warp test pilot, is put in charge of the first human warp 5 vessal, Enterprise. Archer and his crew, including Vulcan science officer T'Pol, engineer Trip Tucker, and Dr. Phlox, seek out new species and new planets (new to humans, at least) and find themselves in the middle of a Temporal Cold War none of them were prepared for...Season 1 largely deals with humanity beginning its quest amongst the stars. Relations with alien species and the ongoing saga with the Suliban are at a prime in this season, with several of the more minor characters remaining seemingly 1 dimensional for this season.

If I have any real complaint it's that it negates a lot of what was written or what happen when you connect the story from this series to the 1960's Star Trek, case in point while many of this generation have grown used to Klingons with warped forehead skull ridges and the like the 60's version were in fact more human and no stronger then humans with the exception of being more militaristic in their government. Still looking pas t these mixed feelings and facts between the two the series still gave us a more somewhat realistic look of how it was when humanity began its deep space exploration thanks due to the discovery of warp drive technology though while the Vulcans while helping still feel humanity lacks the level headiness and emotional control to begin this trek man starts the exploration anyway.  The crew are a a nice intermix of cast and characters who fit the series nicely especially and somewhat surprisingly Scott Bakula as the newly made captain of the interstellar Ship Enterprise as for so long I've just seen this actor as more on the lighter and more comedic roles then anything else but he pulls of this role pretty well.The video and clear and sharp and since it's one and somewhat sadly the last of the franchise to be released on t.v. around 2000 the series is in widescreen format instead of standard format like with the previous series released before it.The audio is also clear and sharp no audio distortions to mention,the extras are decent but I don't really concern myself with those most times.

889437,A1165I5PFKIFEL,B0007TKH66,"Robert Carver ""Space Historian""","[0, 0]",When Enterprise debuted in the fall of 2001 we had come off of having Star Trek on TV starting with The Next Generation which begat Deep Space Nine which begat Voyager while also having several Star Trek movies in the theaters. Star Trek had saturated our media culture for over a decade and there was obviously some franchise fatigue that had set in with the tepid reception for Enterprise. Enterprise survived four seasons rather than the expected seven enjoyed by the previous three series. It is typically the most critically dissed of the Star Trek series and dismissed by many fans as being a misstep for the franchise. I enjoyed the series when it first ran but didn't have the same regard for it that I did TNG and DS9. So it was good to be able to revisit this series via Amazon. Watching Enterprise again has given me a greater appreciation for just how good the characters and stories were once separated from the other series. Season 1 of Enterprise has surprisingly few poor episodes and the overall quality is high. Broken Bow starts the series off with a bang with the best premiere for the franchise. We then get to see how Earth finally moved out of the shadow of Vulcan supervision to become a leader in the politics of the quadrant and in exploring &#34;strange new worlds.&#34; I really enjoyed exploring how our relationship with the Vulcans evolved with the complication of dealing with the Andorians and being a buffer between these species. Then you had the introduction of the Suliban and the Temporal Cold War. In watching this series again (all four seasons back to back) this story arc worked for me. It was an interesting way to bring in the future of the Federation hinging on the actions of Captain Archer and the crew of the Enterprise. A great stand alone episode was Shuttlepod One which helped bond the characters of Trip and Malcolm for the duration of the series. Season 1 set a solid foundation for the success of this series. It is just a shame that Enterprise didn't get the full seven-year run that it deserved.,5,Better than I remembered,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,2052,"['When', 'Enterprise', 'debuted', 'fall', '2001', 'had', 'come', 'having', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TV', 'starting', 'Next', 'Generation', 'begat', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'begat', 'Voyager', 'also', 'having', 'several', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'theaters', 'Star', 'Trek', 'had', 'saturated', 'media', 'culture', 'decade', 'was', 'obviously', 'franchise', 'fatigue', 'had', 'set', 'tepid', 'reception', 'Enterprise', 'Enterprise', 'survived', 'four', 'seasons', 'rather', 'expected', 'seven', 'enjoyed', 'previous', 'three', 'series', 'typically', 'most', 'critically', 'dissed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'dismissed', 'many', 'fans', 'being', 'misstep', 'franchise', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'ran', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'regard', 'did', 'TNG', 'DS9', 'was', 'good', 'be', 'able', 'revisit', 'series', 'Amazon', 'Watching', 'Enterprise', 'again', 'given', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'characters', 'stories', 'were', 'once', 'separated', 'other', 'series', 'Season', '1', 'Enterprise', 'surprisingly', 'few', 'poor', 'episodes', 'overall', 'quality', 'high', 'Broken', 'Bow', 'series', 'bang', 'best', 'premiere', 'franchise', 'then', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Earth', 'finally', 'moved', 'shadow', 'Vulcan', 'supervision', 'become', 'leader', 'politics', 'quadrant', 'exploring', '34', 'strange', 'new', 'worlds.', '34', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'exploring', 'how', 'relationship', 'Vulcans', 'evolved', 'complication', 'dealing', 'Andorians', 'being', 'buffer', 'species', 'Then', 'had', 'introduction', 'Suliban', 'Temporal', 'Cold', 'War', 'watching', 'series', 'again', 'four', 'seasons', 'back', 'back', 'story', 'arc', 'worked', 'was', 'interesting', 'way', 'bring', 'future', 'Federation', 'hinging', 'actions', 'Captain', 'Archer', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'A', 'great', 'stand', 'alone', 'episode', 'was', 'Shuttlepod', 'One', 'helped', 'bond', 'characters', 'Trip', 'Malcolm', 'duration', 'series', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'solid', 'foundation', 'success', 'series', 'just', 'shame', 'Enterprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'seven-year', 'run', 'deserved']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

889443,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B0007TKH66,Roger J. Buffington,"[11, 15]","First, the disclaimer: I loved both The Original Series and The Next Generation.  (I'm still working my way to Deep Space 9 and Voyager, which I missed when on television).  Enterprise, however, is far and away my favorite.  If this show had been presented in 1966, it would probably still be in production.  ""Enterprise"" embodies everything I love about the Star Trek concept...space is new and largely unknown, and humankind has just really begun to master space travel.  The ""transporter"" is highly experimental and quirky, ""phase cannons"" (the precursor to phasers) are brand-new, and there are no tractor beams, just the grappler.  The Vulcans, and indeed several space-faring species, have technology significantly more advanced than that of humanity.  All of this ""new"" technology, and the whole concept of the show lends a unique atmosphere of wonder and freshness to the series.In my opinion the only reason that Enterprise did not last more than its 4 seasons is the overall decline in network television and the concept of situational series.  When The Original Series debuted in 1966 the networks dominated the weeknight entertainment market, and most American households were loyal to their favorite series.  No more.  With DVD players, TiVos, and 500 channel cable, a high budget series like Enterprise has less of a chance.  I am, at least, grateful for the 4 years that this series flourished.  Most of the storylines are excellent, and no few of them are outstanding.""Enterprise"" has cooler weapons, uniforms, and equipment than the later Star Trek series, and the connection to the present day is still there.  Basically, ""Enterprise"" is set in a time about 150 years from now.  Mankind made first contact with the Vulcans (who found Earth) 90 years earlier, and this shocked and inspired humanity such that we very shortly focused on catching up with the Vulcans, and in doing so war, disease, and most other components of human backwardness were left behind.  The starship Enterprise is Earth's first deep space Warp 5 cruiser, capable of fairly quick transit between star systems.The cast of Enterprise is terrific.  Captain Archer, T'Pol, Trip (the chief engineer), Ensign Mayweather (helmsman), Reid (weapons officer), Dr. Phlox, and Hoshi are all very well done by the actors who play them, and in fact I think that these characters are even better done than most of the cast in later Treks.  Opinions will differ, but that's mine.The DVD is a great value.  It has deleted scenes, crisp video and audio, and a good interface.  The packaging is OK, in a tricorder like package that is a trifle clunky for putting on a shelf, but otherwise not bad.""Enterprise"" embodies what I like most about the Star Trek concept: what will humans find when we venture out among the stars, and how will this affect us?  Enterprise is all about this question, with a happy answer than mainly space will affect humanity by bringing out our best and challenging us to greater heights.

It shows things like &#34;phasers&#34; in their initial state of development as well as the Transporter system being feared by most of the crew. It shows the Tricorders in their initial development as being somewhat bulky too. Plus it does a good job with the relationship between Vulcans and Humans when they first got to know each other. It also demonstrates how the relationship between the Captain and the crew develops over time.

And for once, the Vulcans are looked at in a negative way - as a people who hindered humanity's progress. The characters are a bit jaded, yet still embrace the spirit of exploration. This first season may be my favorite of this series. The stories are fresh. And the cast is new and just exploring their characters.

889451,A1KFCZF2V2FS62,B0007TKH66,"Scott C. Locklin ""Selectos nisi das mihi libe...","[7, 25]","It's official: I hate Star Trek Enterprise Season 1. I watched parts of later episodes a few years ago when it was on TV, and it seemed kind of OK compared to the other Trek shows which have come out in recent years. Season 1 is most emphatically not OK.In Season 1, Vulcan chick has the personality of celery. Tactical officer Englishman is an uptight tosser. Captain American likes puppy dogs. Communication neurotic ... why is she on this show? Doctor Flox is kind of cool in a perverted way. Engineer Redneck is pretty awesome, actually: first sympathetic modern unabashed redneck character on televisions. Ethnic complaint: everyone is an American except for the English guy. In old Star Trek, there was Japaneses, Zulus, Scotchmen and Russians. That ruled. This sucks.What is the plot of season-1? The plot is, Vulcans are bad, but maybe they're kind of good and need humans help to help them be better people. Back in the mists of Star Trek history, this sort of dynamic was probably designed to get smart people to think about being more filled with pep and ginger, and dynamic people to be more reflective and logical: this is probably a healthy moral lesson. Somehow that dimension has been lost, and it's turned into some pathetic psychotherapeutic point about being more sensitive. Other important plot device: golly that Vulcan chick is attractive. Seriously, the main plot device is adolescent sexual tension between Vulcan chick and the male members of the crew. While I bet this is popular with fans ... it's death to the story telling. I'm always thinking, ""OK, now they're going to tie the Captain to the Vulcan girl, but she thinks he is stinky."" And it always happens: it is boring and juvenile.  More boring than the faceless guys in red always dying in the old episodes.Storyline: I can't figure it out. Enterprise aimlessly wanders in space. Some scaly green dudes want to hurt people at the behest of the Mysterious Stranger from the Future. And, there are occasionally cool green dudes with antennas who find Vulcans to be as irritating as I find everyone on this show.  Enterprise Season 1 is what I imagine came out of a focus group of Trekkies. Old school Star Trek was the creation of Gene Roddenberry and his genius. It was Shakespearean in its human insight and moral lessons. This is just a compound of adolescent neuroses, soap opera and techno porn. The fragments of the old series show through: some of the plot is straight from old episodes, and the moments of dramatic tension often involve fixing the transporter and engines.My rating: phasers on bored and one half a green dancing alien girl.",1,"Good god, this is terrible",1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,2631,"['official', 'hate', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'Season', '1', 'watched', 'parts', 'later', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'seemed', 'kind', 'OK', 'compared', 'other', 'Trek', 'shows', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', 'Season', '1', 'most', 'emphatically', 'not', 'OK.In', 'Season', '1', 'Vulcan', 'chick', 'personality', 'celery', 'Tactical', 'officer', 'Englishman', 'uptight', 'tosser', 'Captain', 'American', 'likes', 'puppy', 'dogs', 'Communication', 'neurotic', 'why', 'show', 'Doctor', 'Flox', 'kind', 'cool', 'perverted', 'way', 'Engineer', 'Redneck', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'actually', 'first', 'sympathetic', 'modern', 'unabashed', 'redneck', 'character', 'televisions', 'Ethnic', 'complaint', 'everyone', 'American', 'except', 'English', 'guy', 'old', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'Japaneses', 'Zulus', 'Scotchmen', 'Russians', 'ruled', 'plot', 'season-1', 'plot', 'Vulcans', 'are', 'bad', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'kind', 'good', 'need', 'humans', 'help', 'help', 'be', 'better', 'people', 'Back', 'mists', 'Star', 'Trek', 'history', 'sort', 'dynamic', 'was', 'probably', 'designed', 'get', 'smart', 'people', 'think', 'being', 'more', 'filled', 'pep', 'ginger', 'dynamic', 'people', 'be', 'more', 'reflective', 'logical', 'probably', 'healthy', 'moral', 'lesson', 'Somehow', 'dimension', 'been', 'lost', 'turned', 'pathetic', 'psychotherapeutic', 'point', 'being', 'more', 'sensitive', 'Other', 'important', 'plot', 'device', 'golly', 'Vulcan', 'chick', 'attractive', 'Seriously', 'main', 'plot', 'device', 'adolescent', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Vulcan', 'chick', 'male', 'members', 'crew', 'bet', 'popular', 'fans', 'death', 'story', 'telling', ""'m"", 'always', 'thinking', 'OK', 'now', ""'re"", 'going', 'tie', 'Captain', 'Vulcan', 'girl', 'stinky', 'always', 'boring', 'juvenile', 'More', 'boring', 'faceless', 'guys', 'red', 'always', 'dying', 'old', 'episodes.Storyline', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'Enterprise', 'aimlessly', 'space', 'scaly', 'green', 'dudes', 'want', 'hurt', 'people', 'behest', 'Mysterious', 'Stranger', 'Future', 'are', 'occasionally', 'cool', 'green', 'dudes', 'antennas', 'who', 'find', 'Vulcans', 'be', 'as', 'irritating', 'find', 'everyone', 'show', 'Enterprise', 'Season', '1', 'what', 'imagine', 'came', 'focus', 'group', 'Trekkies', 'Old', 'school', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'creation', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'genius', 'was', 'Shakespearean', 'human', 'insight', 'moral', 'lessons', 'just', 'compound', 'adolescent', 'neuroses', 'soap', 'opera', 'techno', 'porn', 'fragments', 'old', 'series', 'show', 'plot', 'straight', 'old', 'episodes', 'moments', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'often', 'involve', 'fixing', 'transporter', 'engines.My', 'rating', 'phasers', 'bored', 'one', 'half', 'green', 'dancing', 'alien', 'girl']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

889460,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B0007TKH66,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[16, 33]","Until recently a mediocre effort that seemed a redux of the show that immediately preceded it, ""Star Trek:  Voyager,"" ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" squanders a big budget and generally watchable cast in its first season, though a few episodes rise above pedestrian.  A completely miscast Scott Bakula, so likable in ""Quantum Leap"" but so wooden and ineffective here, struggles to bring to life Jonathan Archer, perhaps the blandest commanding officer in ""Star Trek's"" 40-year history.  It doesn't help Bakula that the writers aren't sure who the guy is.  His supporting cast--including Connor Trinneer as a folksy engineer, Jolene Blalock as the 22nd century's version of Mr. Spock, John Billingsley as a terrific alien physician, Jeffrey Combs as a feisty, blue-skinned ally, and Vaughn Armstrong as an admiral who shows up in quite a few episodes--is much better, though the actors often aren't given much to do.  Still, they fare better than the rest of the cast, which seems consigned mostly to pushing buttons or supporting in the lamest of ways ""Star Trek's"" commitment to ethnic and racial diversity.  (But let's be honest--most of the world's population is Asian, and none of the series has even shown anything remotely like the reality of the world's population or what it might be in the future.)  Purporting to be a prequel series, ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" only occasionally seems authentic or even respectful of the original ""Star Trek"" and aesthetically, it has much more in common with the plasticky tedium of the newer shows.  Episodes worth watching include ""The Andorian Incident,"" ""Silent Enemy,"" ""The Shadows of P'Jem,"" and ""Shuttlepod One,"" but for some bizarre reason, the producers decided to toss in the distraction of time travel in some episodes, something obviously new to people in the first series.Not surprisingly, under new creative leadership, the show improved markedly this past year and now is starting to genuinely  feel like a prequel.  Even Bakula finally seems to be warming up to his role.  Had the show been as strong out of the gate, it probably would have found a substantial audience.  But the damage has already been done, and the dwindling ratings and news of cancellation speak for themselves.  Too bad.  Don't believe the spin about ""franchise fatigue"" from the people who bungled this series--there's still a healthy audience for ""Star Trek.""  It's just that the audience wants good ""Star Trek.""",3,Never Completely Fulfilled Its Promise as a Prequel,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,2436,"['recently', 'mediocre', 'effort', 'seemed', 'redux', 'show', 'immediately', 'preceded', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'squanders', 'big', 'budget', 'generally', 'watchable', 'cast', 'first', 'season', 'few', 'episodes', 'rise', 'pedestrian', 'completely', 'miscast', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'so', 'likable', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'so', 'wooden', 'ineffective', 'here', 'struggles', 'bring', 'life', 'Jonathan', 'Archer', 'perhaps', 'blandest', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Star', 'Trek', '40-year', 'history', ""n't"", 'help', 'Bakula', 'writers', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'who', 'guy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Connor', 'Trinneer', 'folksy', 'engineer', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', '22nd', 'century', 'version', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'terrific', 'alien', 'physician', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'feisty', 'blue-skinned', 'ally', 'Vaughn', 'Armstrong', 'admiral', 'who', 'up', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'much', 'better', 'actors', 'often', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'Still', 'fare', 'better', 'rest', 'cast', 'consigned', 'mostly', 'pushing', 'buttons', 'supporting', 'lamest', 'ways', 'Star', 'Trek', 'commitment', 'ethnic', 'racial', 'diversity', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'most', 'world', 'population', 'Asian', 'none', 'series', 'even', 'shown', 'anything', 'remotely', 'reality', 'world', 'population', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'future', 'Purporting', 'be', 'prequel', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'only', 'occasionally', 'authentic', 'even', 'respectful', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'aesthetically', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'plasticky', 'tedium', 'newer', 'shows', 'Episodes', 'watching', 'include', 'Andorian', 'Incident', 'Silent', 'Enemy', 'Shadows', ""P'Jem"", 'Shuttlepod', 'One', 'bizarre', 'reason', 'producers', 'decided', 'toss', 'distraction', 'time', 'travel', 'episodes', 'something', 'obviously', 'new', 'people', 'first', 'series.Not', 'surprisingly', 'new', 'creative', 'leadership', 'show', 'improved', 'markedly', 'past', 'year', 'now', 'starting', 'genuinely', 'feel', 'prequel', 'Even', 'Bakula', 'finally', 'be', 'warming', 'up', 'role', 'Had', 'show', 'been', 'strong', 'gate', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'substantial', 'audience', 'damage', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'dwindling', 'ratings', 'news', 'cancellation', 'speak', 'Too', 'bad', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'spin', 'franchise', 'fatigue', 'people', 'who', 'bungled', 'series', 'still', 'healthy', 'audience', 'Star', 'Trek', 'just', 'audience', 'good', 'Star', 'Trek']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

889472,A3C3CJKYHNDVQ0,B0007TKH66,TheMaximusKane,"[0, 0]","While many people may disagree with the headline of this opinionated review; this is my favorite of all the Star Trek Series.  I love The Next Generation and Voyager and I give ultimate respect to the original series; I see Deep Space 9 as nothing more than a footnote to the Trek Universe.  I was never been a big fan of the original series but became a great fan of the original cast because the motion pictures.  The original show Star Trek wasn't my cup of tea but I can't ignore what they and Gene Roddenberry did to create this universe.  As far as Enterprise goes; the direction to have a series prequel was a great concept.  The only downfall is that there were only four seasons.  In seeing how they integrated what eventually became landmarks on the shows previous to Enterprise (i.e. the Prime directive, Red Alert, the birth of the Federation) was cool to see how they saw the birth of those things.  Season two is even better and the beginning of Season Three and some of the episodes in Season Three were great but there were a lot that dropped off because of a season long story line.  Season Four was also great and showed us how they were gaining their footing again when the short lived series was ended.  I wish there were more seasons or at least a movie with the cast and the first Captain of the Starship Enterprise.  If you haven't seen the series you should.  If you don't agree with me that's OK but re-watch the series with the other series in mind and make the connections and how they were integrated into the more contemporary series and recent movies like &#34;Star Trek&#34; and &#34;Star Trek: Into Darkness.&#34;  Play close attention to the episode in Season Two called &#34;Regeneration&#34; which deals with the Borg that Captain Picard and his crew destroyed in &#34;First Contact.&#34;  In season four pay attention to the &#34;Augments&#34; and the three episode mini series with Brent Spiner that explains what will eventually result in Data and explains Khan in both the original &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; and &#34;Into Darkness.&#34;",5,Best of the series,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,2073,"['many', 'people', 'may', 'disagree', 'headline', 'opinionated', 'review', 'favorite', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Series', 'love', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Voyager', 'give', 'ultimate', 'respect', 'original', 'series', 'see', 'Deep', 'Space', '9', 'nothing', 'more', 'footnote', 'Trek', 'Universe', 'was', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'series', 'became', 'great', 'fan', 'original', 'cast', 'motion', 'pictures', 'original', 'show', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'what', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'did', 'create', 'universe', 'As', 'far', 'Enterprise', 'direction', 'have', 'series', 'prequel', 'was', 'great', 'concept', 'only', 'downfall', 'were', 'only', 'four', 'seasons', 'seeing', 'how', 'integrated', 'what', 'eventually', 'became', 'landmarks', 'shows', 'previous', 'Enterprise', 'i.e', 'Prime', 'directive', 'Red', 'Alert', 'birth', 'Federation', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'how', 'saw', 'birth', 'things', 'Season', 'two', 'even', 'better', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Three', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Three', 'were', 'great', 'were', 'lot', 'dropped', 'season', 'long', 'story', 'line', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'showed', 'how', 'were', 'gaining', 'footing', 'again', 'when', 'short', 'lived', 'series', 'was', 'ended', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'seasons', 'least', 'movie', 'cast', 'first', 'Captain', 'Starship', 'Enterprise', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'should', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'OK', 're-watch', 'series', 'other', 'series', 'mind', 'make', 'connections', 'how', 'were', 'integrated', 'more', 'contemporary', 'series', 'recent', 'movies', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', '34', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness.', '34', 'Play', 'close', 'attention', 'episode', 'Season', 'Two', 'called', '34', 'Regeneration', '34', 'Borg', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'crew', 'destroyed', '34', 'First', 'Contact.', '34', 'season', 'four', 'pay', 'attention', '34', 'Augments', '34', 'three', 'episode', 'mini', 'series', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'what', 'will', 'eventually', 'result', 'Data', 'Khan', 'original', '34', 'Wrath', 'Khan', '34', '34', 'Into', 'Darkness.', '34']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

The year is 2151 and the Vulcans have reluctantly released star charts to the humans, enabling them to navigate deep space.  Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), the commanding officer of the starship Enterprise, is a charismatic leader with an insatiable curiosity who inspires tremendous loyalty among his crew.  At the time of ""Enterprise,"" technology is not nearly as advanced as in the ""Star Trek"" series, set further in the future.  Many aspects of space travel are, for the people of Earth, works in progress.In the expansive ""Star Trek"" franchise -- both on the big and small screens -- ""Enterprise"" was the last TV series, coming long after the successes of ""The Next Generation,"" ""Deep Space Nine,"" and ""Voyager.""  It was the first ""Star Trek"" series to be produced and broadcast in high-definition video, but lasted only four seasons.Though some episodes recapture the magic of earlier series, there are a number of drawn-out, talky shows that are better geared for radio than television, since they lack strong visuals.  Perhaps this has to do with a limited budget, but it's sad to see such a glorious, highly popular franchise diminished by pedestrian writing and lackluster acting.Bonus features on the six-disc Blu-ray release include a new three-part documentary containing new cast and crew interviews and vintage behind-the-scenes footage; cast and crew commentaries on select episodes; and ""In Conversation,"" a candid interview with creators Rick Berman and Branon Braga.",2,Weakest link in the Star Trek franchise,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1602,"['Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'Season', 'One', 'set', 'early', 'days', 'Earth', 'exploration', 'universe', 'year', '2151', 'Vulcans', 'have', 'reluctantly', 'released', 'star', 'charts', 'humans', 'enabling', 'navigate', 'deep', 'space', 'Captain', 'Jonathan', 'Archer', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'commanding', 'officer', 'starship', 'Enterprise', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'insatiable', 'curiosity', 'who', 'tremendous', 'loyalty', 'crew', 'time', 'Enterprise', 'technology', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'advanced', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'set', 'further', 'future', 'Many', 'aspects', 'space', 'travel', 'are', 'people', 'Earth', 'progress.In', 'expansive', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'big', 'small', 'screens', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'last', 'TV', 'series', 'coming', 'long', 'successes', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Voyager', 'was', 'first', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'be', 'produced', 'broadcast', 'high-definition', 'video', 'lasted', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'recapture', 'magic', 'earlier', 'series', 'are', 'number', 'drawn-out', 'talky', 'shows', 'are', 'better', 'geared', 'radio', 'television', 'lack', 'strong', 'visuals', 'Perhaps', 'do', 'limited', 'budget', 'sad', 'see', 'such', 'glorious', 'highly', 'popular', 'franchise', 'diminished', 'pedestrian', 'writing', 'lackluster', 'acting.Bonus', 'features', 'six-disc', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'include', 'new', 'three-part', 'documentary', 'containing', 'new', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'vintage', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'cast', 'crew', 'commentaries', 'select', 'episodes', 'Conversation', 'candid', 'interview', 'creators', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'Branon', 'Braga']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

I have always been a die hard ST fan and I just couldn't get into it. Granted, at the time I was very busy so it was very easy for me not to give it much of a chance. A year ago I watched it for the first time beyond the first 3 or 4 episodes. I must say I enjoyed it and was sorry it didn't run as long as the other ST series. One thing I hated, at the time it first aired, was the intro song. All the other ST shows had full orchestrated music that was fitting to the grand nature of the concept and shows. Now, years later, I can appreciate it as a transitional phase. In the ST universe, &#34;we&#34; were emerging into the galaxy as explorers. If you think about it, people weren't so different in Enterprise as they are now. They had not fully evolved as they had in the other shows which were hundreds of years later. Now, I think this series shows a kind of segue from our current rather primitive state of being (wars, greed & power struggles we currently endure) to the next step of cowboy Kirk and beyond to the enlightened era of STNG and beyond. The characters are fun and seriously, the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because, try as I might, I really had problems with this Angelina Jolie Vulcan.

Originally the first season as envisioned by co-crators Brannon Braga and Rick Berman was to take place almost entirely on Earth with the ship being build and the drama that surrounded that (including protesters, etc.)with the conclusion being the launching of Enterprise.Paramount hated the idea and also didn't like the idea of a prequel that would connect more with who we are now than the 24th century (and, in fact, Paramount wanted the next show to take place BEYOND ""ST:TNG""). The studio compromised with the co-creators only on the grounds that ""Enterprise"" DIDN'T take place entirely on Earth during the first season and focused on the crew's first adventures in space. The temporal cold war story arc was introduced as a compromise since Paramount wanted SOMETHING from the far future introduced into the show.If you add in the viewer fatigue (the co-creators wanted to take a couple of years between the end of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" and ""Enterprise"" but were forced to launch the show immediately)after having three ""Star Trek"" series in a row, it's no wonder that ""Enterprise"", which initially was a ratings winner, lost most of its audience by the end of the first season.In spite of all that ""Enterprise"" was a decent show during its first season that kept striving for better and finally reached that goal having lost most of its audience by the third season. For every outstanding episode there were two that ranged from fair to mediocre and could have been on ANY ""Trek"" series (and still been mediocre).""Enterprise"" was shot on film for its first two seasons and HD vide for its third and fourth. The masters were prepared in HD for broadcast. The detail during the live action scenes is pretty good and blacks are fairly good in scenes where there are no visual effects. Unfortunately, the visual effects were shot at 480p or 720p depending on how involved the shot was and these have been upscaled. They STILL look better than the DVD's in that regard with better fine detail BUT the visual effects sequences are softer (particularly those integrated with live action)and the shift between higher def and upscaled is noticeable at times.The pilot episode looks the worst--it wasn't shot with widescreen in mind (Paramount couldn't make up its mind about what aspect ratio the show would be broadcast in)and has been blown up for widescreen resulting in a soft, grainy look that is filled with artifacts. The good news is that the show improves with each successive episode on the set.What makes this set especially worthwhile (aside from the improved image qualty -even if it isn't demo quality-compared to the DVD's)are the special features; all of the original special features have been ported over plus we get four new commentary tracks.We also get a three part documentary on the creation of the show where Braga, Berman and the cast are brutally honest in their assessment of ""Enterpirse"" (Braga being the most honest--he calls many of the episodes crap and takes responsibility as he was the head writer but pointed out that he and those who came over from ""Voyager"" were exhausted and needed a break which Paramount wouldn't give them at that point).We also get a good featurette with Braga and Berman discussing the creation of the show as well as discussing the accusations that THEY killed the franchise with ""Enterprise"".While ""Enterprise"" was flawed during its first season (every ""Trek"" series has been except ""Star Trek"" where the first and second seasons were the best)and those flaws still dogged the show during a much improved second season, the show didn't get the shot it deserved. The third and fourth seasons proved how good ""Enterprise"" could be (exceptional)unfortunately most of the audience except die hards had tuned out by that point and UPN cancelled the series (even though the fifth season had amibitions similar to ""Fringe"" with a number of episodes taking place in the alternate universe we glimpsed during the fourth season very briefly).The A/V isn't perfect but it looks better than the DVD's. Hopefully as we continue to see new seasons released we'll see an improvement in the over all look of the show as well.Recommended",3,"Uneven first season of ""Enterprise"" with uneven Blu-ray transfers--still worth while for fans",1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,4270,"['NEW', 'REVIEW', 'FOR', 'BLU-RAY', 'Enterprise', 'got', 'caught', 'web', 'studio', 'politics', 'immediately', 'Originally', 'first', 'season', 'envisioned', 'co-crators', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'was', 'take', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Earth', 'ship', 'being', 'build', 'drama', 'surrounded', 'including', 'protesters', 'etc', 'conclusion', 'being', 'launching', 'Enterprise.Paramount', 'hated', 'idea', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'idea', 'prequel', 'would', 'connect', 'more', 'who', 'are', 'now', '24th', 'century', 'fact', 'Paramount', 'wanted', 'next', 'show', 'take', 'place', 'BEYOND', 'ST', 'TNG', 'studio', 'compromised', 'co-creators', 'only', 'grounds', 'Enterprise', ""N'T"", 'take', 'place', 'entirely', 'Earth', 'first', 'season', 'focused', 'crew', 'first', 'adventures', 'space', 'temporal', 'cold', 'war', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'introduced', 'compromise', 'Paramount', 'wanted', 'SOMETHING', 'far', 'future', 'introduced', 'show.If', 'add', 'viewer', 'fatigue', 'co-creators', 'wanted', 'take', 'couple', 'years', 'end', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'Enterprise', 'were', 'forced', 'launch', 'show', 'immediately', 'having', 'three', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'row', 'wonder', 'Enterprise', 'initially', 'was', 'ratings', 'winner', 'lost', 'most', 'audience', 'end', 'first', 'season.In', 'spite', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'decent', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'kept', 'striving', 'better', 'finally', 'reached', 'goal', 'having', 'lost', 'most', 'audience', 'third', 'season', 'outstanding', 'episode', 'were', 'two', 'ranged', 'fair', 'mediocre', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ANY', 'Trek', 'series', 'still', 'been', 'mediocre', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'shot', 'film', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'HD', 'vide', 'third', 'fourth', 'masters', 'were', 'prepared', 'HD', 'broadcast', 'detail', 'live', 'action', 'scenes', 'pretty', 'good', 'blacks', 'are', 'fairly', 'good', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'visual', 'effects', 'Unfortunately', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'shot', '480p', '720p', 'depending', 'how', 'involved', 'shot', 'was', 'have', 'been', 'upscaled', 'STILL', 'look', 'better', 'DVD', 'regard', 'better', 'fine', 'detail', 'BUT', 'visual', 'effects', 'sequences', 'are', 'softer', 'particularly', 'integrated', 'live', 'action', 'shift', 'higher', 'def', 'upscaled', 'noticeable', 'times.The', 'pilot', 'episode', 'worst', 'was', ""n't"", 'shot', 'widescreen', 'mind', 'Paramount', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'aspect', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'broadcast', 'been', 'blown', 'up', 'widescreen', 'resulting', 'soft', 'grainy', 'look', 'filled', 'artifacts', 'good', 'news', 'show', 'successive', 'episode', 'set.What', 'set', 'especially', 'worthwhile', 'aside', 'improved', 'image', 'qualty', '-even', ""n't"", 'demo', 'quality-compared', 'DVD', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'original', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'been', 'ported', 'get', 'four', 'new', 'commentary', 'tracks.We', 'also', 'get', 'three', 'part', 'documentary', 'creation', 'show', 'where', 'Braga', 'Berman', 'cast', 'are', 'brutally', 'honest', 'assessment', 'Enterpirse', 'Braga', 'being', 'most', 'honest', 'many', 'episodes', 'crap', 'responsibility', 'was', 'head', 'writer', 'pointed', 'out', 'who', 'came', 'Voyager', 'were', 'exhausted', 'needed', 'break', 'Paramount', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'point', '.We', 'also', 'get', 'good', 'featurette', 'Braga', 'Berman', 'discussing', 'creation', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'discussing', 'accusations', 'THEY', 'killed', 'franchise', 'Enterprise', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'flawed', 'first', 'season', 'Trek', 'series', 'been', 'Star', 'Trek', 'where', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'were', 'best', 'flaws', 'still', 'dogged', 'show', 'much', 'improved', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'shot', 'deserved', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'proved', 'how', 'good', 'Enterprise', 'could', 'be', 'exceptional', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'audience', 'die', 'hards', 'had', 'tuned', 'out', 'point', 'UPN', 'cancelled', 'series', 'even', 'fifth', 'season', 'had', 'amibitions', 'similar', 'Fringe', 'number', 'episodes', 'taking', 'place', 'alternate', 'universe', 'glimpsed', 'fourth', 'season', 'very', 'briefly', '.The', 'A/V', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'better', 'DVD', 'Hopefully', 'continue', 'see', 'new', 'seasons', 'released', ""'ll"", 'see', 'improvement', 'look', 'show', 'well.Recommended']",Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season

His character was just so ill at ease and generally stiff it never really won me over. Characters I LOVED though were Trip Tucker and Dr. Phlox, they just had a warmness and geniune feel, they seemed real. Most of the other characters didn't work for me, T'pal was hit and miss, though she had some bright spots.I would like to see the other Seasons to see how much the show improved like many here say but when the STAR of the show puts you off somewhat, I have a feeling I'll never fully love this series, even though I do respect it and feel it was a decent look at Star Trek.Lastly, I can say this price point is ridiculous. The original series is justified because it's almost like my religion plus older television just has more replay value for some reason, not so with this. I *might* pay 50, but not 100, no way. Why are Starsky and Hutch $45 with the same run time? Why is my Millennium sets also about $45 with similar minutes and Enterprise is double the price??
