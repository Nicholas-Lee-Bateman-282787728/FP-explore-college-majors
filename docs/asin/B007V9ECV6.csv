1538596,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B007V9ECV6,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[23, 26]","The main flaw is that Geneon was soon to go under, and they outsourced a lot of animation to cheaper (low budget) Korean firms. It really shows. Episode one is really the only episode where the series shines in the animation department. As it progresses, things go from bad to worse. Long shots show characters that look deformed, and often the lines are in inexplicable places. The episode in the dome with no living beings is a good example.But Funimation has acquired a lot of Geneon's old licenses and they are re-releasing a ton of series right now. The price is right for this one however. 23 episodes for $24. Solid deal.Dai Sato lends his masterful touch to the writing (he previously worked on Wolf's Rain and would go on to work as chief scriptwriter for Eureka Seven). The story is one of the best I have ever witnessed in anime. It is rife with references to old Greek lore. What starts off looking like a futuristic, crime fighting series similar to Blade Runner ends up as a philosophical story. What does it mean to exist? And throughout the series the question is constantly rasised ""What is my raison d'tre?"". Even the Aristocracy (more geared towards a Timocracy - ruled with honor by chosen few) ask citizens to find their raison d'tre.There is one odd episode, Nightmare Quiz Show, but when it ends you kind of see what was going on and you actually find out a bit of back story (the spaceship and all).The conflict is between humans / autoreivs (semi-sentient androids) / and the Proxys (sic). I enjoy that the autoreivs have a 'Turing application' (Alan Turing is the father of artificial intelligence). Each of these beings has a reason for existing, and unfortunately their inability to coexist begins to bring about chaos.Rie-L Mayer is the protagonist, she looks like the chick from Evanescence. Her father is a puppet mayor of Romdeau under the 'philosophers'. She works for the investigations department and ends up involved in a strange case involving immigrant Vincent Law. The one thing I wasn't clear on is where these 'immigrants' came from. It seems they came from Moscque, but we're never really privy to that information. But events transpire exposing Rie-L to the Proxys and forcing her out of the city into the poisonous air of the outside. Her story really begins there. Her and Vincent are accompanied by Pino, a child autoreiv that was discarded after the mother was finally able to 'acquire' a human child. At times Pino seems more human than anyone else in the series. She is clearly my favorite character! She is based on Pinocchio. You know, the doll who wants to be real.The story is so well written and complex that you will probably need to watch through the series multiple times. So purchasing the series is highly recommended. The animation gets worse, but the story gets weirder and better as the series progresses. The Geneon US voice over was actually pretty good, but I'm almost positive Funimation will re-dub. The Japanese cast is also very good, though this was one series that was hard to make the call on. I watch 95% of anime in Japanese with English subtitles, but this was one that was as good either way. Hopefully Funi will do it right.Also, the music is amazing. I actually own the soundtracks (back when Geneon was putting them with the special editions). It's a dark, instrumental sound, almost with a techno edge. The intro song is really catchy, it's by Monoral which is a Japanese band despite the song being in English. The ending credits are Radiohead Paranoid Android. Which is one of Radiohead's best songs. It works great as a closing song.In my humble Otaku opinion, you should buy this. Every sci-fi anime fan should at least watch it. It's not big action and battles, not mecha, and not cutesy girls with magic powers. It's a solid story with a lot of philosophy.I imagine that if Nietzsche, Philip K Dick, and Ray Bradbury were to create a futuristic anime series, this would be it.",5,Funimation re-release of a flawed yet brilliant series ~,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,3962,"['main', 'flaw', 'Geneon', 'was', 'soon', 'go', 'outsourced', 'lot', 'animation', 'cheaper', 'low', 'budget', 'Korean', 'firms', 'really', 'Episode', 'one', 'really', 'only', 'episode', 'where', 'series', 'shines', 'animation', 'department', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Long', 'shots', 'show', 'characters', 'look', 'deformed', 'often', 'lines', 'are', 'inexplicable', 'places', 'episode', 'dome', 'living', 'beings', 'good', 'example.But', 'Funimation', 'acquired', 'lot', 'Geneon', 'old', 'licenses', 'are', 're-releasing', 'ton', 'series', 'right', 'now', 'price', 'right', 'one', 'however', '23', 'episodes', '24', 'Solid', 'deal.Dai', 'Sato', 'masterful', 'touch', 'writing', 'previously', 'worked', 'Wolf', 'Rain', 'would', 'go', 'work', 'as', 'chief', 'scriptwriter', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'story', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'anime', 'rife', 'references', 'old', 'Greek', 'lore', 'What', 'off', 'looking', 'futuristic', 'crime', 'fighting', 'series', 'similar', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'up', 'philosophical', 'story', 'What', 'mean', 'exist', 'series', 'question', 'constantly', 'rasised', 'What', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'Even', 'Aristocracy', 'more', 'geared', 'Timocracy', 'ruled', 'honor', 'chosen', 'few', 'ask', 'citizens', 'find', 'raison', 'one', 'odd', 'episode', 'Nightmare', 'Quiz', 'Show', 'when', 'kind', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'actually', 'find', 'out', 'bit', 'back', 'story', 'spaceship', '.The', 'conflict', 'humans', '/', 'autoreivs', 'semi-sentient', 'androids', '/', 'Proxys', 'sic', 'enjoy', 'autoreivs', 'have', ""'Turing"", 'application', 'Alan', 'Turing', 'father', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'beings', 'reason', 'existing', 'unfortunately', 'inability', 'coexist', 'begins', 'bring', 'about', 'chaos.Rie-L', 'Mayer', 'protagonist', 'chick', 'Evanescence', 'father', 'puppet', 'mayor', 'Romdeau', ""'philosophers"", 'investigations', 'department', 'up', 'involved', 'strange', 'case', 'involving', 'immigrant', 'Vincent', 'Law', 'one', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'where', ""'immigrants"", 'came', 'came', 'Moscque', ""'re"", 'never', 'really', 'privy', 'information', 'events', 'transpire', 'exposing', 'Rie-L', 'Proxys', 'forcing', 'out', 'city', 'poisonous', 'air', 'outside', 'story', 'really', 'there', 'Vincent', 'are', 'accompanied', 'Pino', 'child', 'autoreiv', 'was', 'discarded', 'mother', 'was', 'finally', 'able', ""'acquire"", 'human', 'child', 'times', 'Pino', 'more', 'human', 'anyone', 'else', 'series', 'clearly', 'favorite', 'character', 'based', 'Pinocchio', 'know', 'doll', 'who', 'be', 'real.The', 'story', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'complex', 'will', 'probably', 'need', 'watch', 'series', 'multiple', 'times', 'So', 'purchasing', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended', 'animation', 'worse', 'story', 'weirder', 'better', 'series', 'Geneon', 'US', 'voice', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', ""'m"", 'almost', 'positive', 'Funimation', 'will', 're-dub', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'one', 'series', 'was', 'hard', 'make', 'call', 'watch', '95', '%', 'anime', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'Hopefully', 'Funi', 'will', 'do', 'right.Also', 'music', 'amazing', 'actually', 'own', 'soundtracks', 'back', 'when', 'Geneon', 'was', 'putting', 'special', 'editions', 'dark', 'instrumental', 'sound', 'almost', 'techno', 'edge', 'intro', 'song', 'really', 'catchy', 'Monoral', 'Japanese', 'band', 'song', 'being', 'English', 'ending', 'credits', 'are', 'Radiohead', 'Paranoid', 'Android', 'Which', 'one', 'Radiohead', 'best', 'songs', 'great', 'closing', 'song.In', 'humble', 'Otaku', 'opinion', 'should', 'buy', 'sci-fi', 'anime', 'fan', 'should', 'least', 'watch', 'not', 'big', 'action', 'battles', 'not', 'mecha', 'not', 'cutesy', 'girls', 'magic', 'powers', 'solid', 'story', 'lot', 'philosophy.I', 'imagine', 'Nietzsche', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'were', 'create', 'futuristic', 'anime', 'series', 'would', 'be']",N/A

1538598,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B007V9ECV6,Coulter Rail,"[3, 3]","There's so much to appreciate in this anime. With a dark mood, masterful shot blocking, and smooth pacing, it truly captures the sterile, supremely controlled world the characters start out in. The latter half of the series falters, suffering some lost narrative and eventually concluding with an ending that lacks the intelligence and intrigue of the first half. Nonetheless, it's still a wonderfully grim journey through a world that I'm sure the creators are proud of.***PROS***ANIMATIONReminiscent of Ghost in the Shell: SAC, but darker and without the washed-over look. The first few episodes are stunning. The visuals fall off in the middle (lazy shot blocking and three-frame movements/stills), but I believe it was the animation team's choice to do so, wanting to save their tenacious skills for the big parts. Their minor detour will not deter you from the path.SETTINGThe world created in the show goes from a sterile, emotionless society preserved in a dome, to the deserts of the free-willed disenfranchised and the grief-scape beyond. If you like a dark mood and a world that is handed to you in pieces, then enjoy the ride.CHARACTERSThey are a mystery--all of them, each with motivations both pure and twisted. They do not unravel to the promise they're capable of, but still hold genuine revelations that are rewarding and wholesomely desolate to behold.MUSICSome of the best I've heard in anime: ghostly, uplifting with consequence, and melodically tense. I rarely listen to the opening and end credits for every episode in a series, but in this show's case, I did so with purpose.***CONS***LOST NARRATIVEAs this journey started to examine time lost and aimless goals, I applauded the direction and the bored disorientation I began to feel. When they stayed lost for five episodes, I started to worry. The finale came, and the resolution seemed weaker than the promise of the premise. Let's just say the questions were better than the answers.All in all, I recommend this series to anyone who's ready to break from the norm and take a trip. Whether or not you like what is at the end for the characters is irrelevant; somewhere along the line, this show has a way of making you ask questions about yourself, and that insight is worth the time.

I'll have to be honest, it took me over 2 years to finally actually get through watching this because I'd start, stop... forget, restart... watch it while going to bed etc. Well, the style is amazing... the atmosphere and feel of the world is dark, moody, cyberpunk post apocalyptic in nature but engaging. The thing that makes this sleep inducing is the overall elements of dark graphics and monotonous voice acting for the english version. Vincent's voice is listless, Iggy's voice in monotone, and Re-L is almost completely antagnonistic throughtout the entire series up until the last few episodes... if a Blu-ray version comes out then I'll probably try the original Japanese language which will hopefully not be as trance inducingly boring.

Great opener and good closer with Radio Head's &#34;Paranoid Android&#34;Animation:  Breath takingTheme:  Dark yet vibrant",5,Epic Ergo Proxy,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,569,"['First', 'want', 'say', 'reviews', 'series', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'want', 'show', 'think', 'feel', 'then', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'this.Characters', 'Well', 'developed', 'vulnerable', 'relatable.Romance', 'Hard', 'understand', 'times', 'be', 'backbone', 'whole', 'storyPlot', 'Excellent', 'aside', 'few', 'bizarre', 'standalone', 'episodes.Themes', 'Existentialism', 'romance', 'faith', 'destiny', 'moreMusic', 'Top', 'notch', 'Great', 'opener', 'good', 'closer', 'Radio', 'Head', '34', 'Paranoid', 'Android', '34', 'Animation', 'Breath', 'takingTheme', 'Dark', 'yet', 'vibrant']",N/A
1538609,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B007V9ECV6,Sean,"[6, 7]","Ergo Proxy is an anime that does a number of things right. First of all, it is an adult anime that treats it's viewer as an adult. There are no boob jokes or typical anime fair, it's a lot of philosophical and biblical things that make up a good portion of the show. The show does a good job of being intelligent, though sometimes this comes off as totally insane. The ending is a typical anime ending that leaves you scratching your head, but the ending comes to abruptly and comes right out of left field that it leaves you scratching your head even longer than usual. Think Big O quality of what the hell at the end.I like to say that the story is told in three acts because the acts are all completely different. The first act is the one that many people will think to associate with the whole series, a cyberpunk-y kind of crime show. Then the second act rolls around and we get a lot of exploration and get to know the world even better. The third act is when the show---well, it doesn't degrade, I like anime that does crazy things at the end and I was sort of expecting it---but it just doesn't fit in with the rest of the series. I don't know how to react to the ending because it was just too different from the rest of the show. It just wasn't set up enough that we would be tromping through biblical/religious/philosophical ground for a whole three nonsensical episodes. The episodes before that are all internal conflicts and a lot of it makes no sense as well, but you think the end will be a very psychologically stressing one for the characters, but it turns out to be just psychological stress on the person watching and wondering what the hell is going on.Ergo Proxy has good animation, it's landscapes look amazing. The characters are another story though. They look decent from up close but far away they look pretty crappy. Overall though the animation is pretty good. Characters do look a lot more gritty and realistic than other animes, but that's not enough to save the fact it just looks choppy at some points.The Japanese voice actors do a good job and the music, well, there's barely enough to really complain about. It doesn't exactly need music though because there is enough dialogue to suffice. The opening theme is alright, though I've heard better before. The end theme just plain sucks. Otherwise, everything sounds good and the sound would have been a 10 if not for the end theme.I had a hard time deciding the score on characters. I liked them all for whatever reason, but most were shallow. Lil Mayar who should have been the outstanding character of the series is just kind of bitchy and dull, Vincent isn't all that compelling, and Pino can come off as a decent character at points but at other points just doesn't come off as any good either. Raul, who actually was shaping up to be an awesome character, just turns out to be bland and Daedalus is probably the worst character of the series, I still have no idea what the hell he had to do with much of anything.This anime is not something that you can go into as a fan of cyberpunk, because it's not cyberpunk. It's a weird mix of cyberpunk, steampunk, apocalyptic, and religious that works to a degree, but ends on a weaker note because of it's attempt at blowing our minds toward the end with it's religious turn. While it's last episode is enjoyable for those who do like to mull over the meaning and everything, it may be way to much for the average fan of anime. Hell, the whole series may be a bit too much. It caters to a certain sci-fi niche essentially and for whatever reason, I wish the world that was created (an exceptional world) could have been utilized much better than with this overly-complicated and scatterbrained plot that's only job seems to be to hurt the brain.Not that I didn't enjoy it. It was a good anime, an anime for adults and thinking types. While some of it's philosophy came off as corny a lot of it was pretty good and there are a lot of things you can decipher from this anime if you really want to think into it. And that's probably part of the reason I don't understand bits of the plot, I don't feel like thinking.Can I suggest this to everyone? Definitely not. But Ergo Proxy comes off with an 8 for me. Not one of my favorites, but can be an enjoyable ride for those with the right mindset to take it.",4,"An Intelligent, Somewhat Memorable Romp",1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,4333,"['Ergo', 'Proxy', 'anime', 'number', 'things', 'right', 'First', 'all', 'adult', 'anime', 'viewer', 'adult', 'are', 'boob', 'jokes', 'typical', 'anime', 'fair', 'lot', 'philosophical', 'biblical', 'things', 'make', 'up', 'good', 'portion', 'show', 'show', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'intelligent', 'though', 'sometimes', 'off', 'totally', 'insane', 'ending', 'typical', 'anime', 'ending', 'scratching', 'head', 'ending', 'abruptly', 'right', 'left', 'field', 'scratching', 'head', 'even', 'longer', 'usual', 'Think', 'Big', 'O', 'quality', 'what', 'hell', 'end.I', 'say', 'story', 'told', 'three', 'acts', 'acts', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'first', 'act', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'think', 'associate', 'whole', 'series', 'cyberpunk-y', 'kind', 'crime', 'show', 'Then', 'second', 'act', 'rolls', 'get', 'lot', 'exploration', 'get', 'know', 'world', 'even', 'better', 'third', 'act', 'when', 'show', '-well', ""n't"", 'degrade', 'like', 'anime', 'crazy', 'things', 'end', 'was', 'sort', 'expecting', '-but', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'react', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'different', 'rest', 'show', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'enough', 'would', 'be', 'tromping', 'biblical/religious/philosophical', 'ground', 'whole', 'three', 'nonsensical', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'are', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'lot', 'sense', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'psychologically', 'stressing', 'one', 'characters', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'psychological', 'stress', 'person', 'watching', 'wondering', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'on.Ergo', 'Proxy', 'good', 'animation', 'landscapes', 'look', 'amazing', 'characters', 'are', 'story', 'look', 'decent', 'close', 'far', 'away', 'look', 'pretty', 'crappy', 'Overall', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'Characters', 'do', 'look', 'lot', 'more', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'other', 'animes', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'fact', 'just', 'choppy', 'points.The', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'music', 'well', 'barely', 'enough', 'really', 'complain', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'need', 'music', 'enough', 'dialogue', 'suffice', 'opening', 'theme', 'alright', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'better', 'before', 'end', 'theme', 'just', 'plain', 'sucks', 'Otherwise', 'everything', 'sounds', 'good', 'sound', 'would', 'have', 'been', '10', 'not', 'end', 'theme.I', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'deciding', 'score', 'characters', 'liked', 'reason', 'most', 'were', 'shallow', 'Lil', 'Mayar', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'outstanding', 'character', 'series', 'just', 'kind', 'bitchy', 'dull', 'Vincent', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'Pino', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'decent', 'character', 'points', 'other', 'points', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'good', 'either', 'Raul', 'who', 'actually', 'was', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'awesome', 'character', 'just', 'out', 'be', 'bland', 'Daedalus', 'probably', 'worst', 'character', 'series', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'hell', 'had', 'do', 'much', 'anything.This', 'anime', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'go', 'fan', 'cyberpunk', 'not', 'cyberpunk', 'weird', 'mix', 'cyberpunk', 'steampunk', 'apocalyptic', 'religious', 'degree', 'weaker', 'note', 'attempt', 'blowing', 'minds', 'end', 'religious', 'turn', 'last', 'episode', 'enjoyable', 'who', 'do', 'mull', 'meaning', 'everything', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'much', 'average', 'fan', 'anime', 'Hell', 'whole', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'certain', 'sci-fi', 'niche', 'essentially', 'reason', 'wish', 'world', 'was', 'created', 'exceptional', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'utilized', 'much', 'better', 'overly-complicated', 'scatterbrained', 'plot', 'only', 'job', 'be', 'hurt', 'brain.Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'was', 'good', 'anime', 'anime', 'adults', 'thinking', 'types', 'philosophy', 'came', 'off', 'corny', 'lot', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'can', 'decipher', 'anime', 'really', 'want', 'think', 'probably', 'part', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'bits', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'thinking.Can', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'Definitely', 'not', 'Ergo', 'Proxy', 'off', '8', 'Not', 'one', 'favorites', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'right', 'mindset', 'take']",N/A
