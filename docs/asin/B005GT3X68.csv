I mean, I did like the first three in the Wrong Turn series. However, my taste in movies has changed in the last year or so and I just have a hard time getting into these dumb violent movies these days. Wrong Turn 4 has a few scares, and the killers are pretty disturbing and grotesque looking. And there is a ton of gore. This one is definitely for the gorehounds.Spoiler Alert:The ending is horrible in my opinion. I would have preferred for there to have been at least one good character live. But two of the would-be heroines get decapitated at the very end, while the inbred cannibals survive to do more killing.End SpoilerSo, if it's gore that you want, Wrong Turn 4 is good for that.

Honestly, I didn't even know there names & i've seen the previous three movies. Anyways, they overtake sanatorium. They kill the lead doctor in a realistic looking way, doesn't look like they used cgi at all. Then we cut to a couple making out & a lesbian couple making out on the other side of the room! Don't worry, the good stuff ends for awhile. Group of teens head to a cabin as a snow storm approachs & they get lost but find the eerie looking sanatorium in the middle of nowhere & decide to shack up there for the night as the snow storm nears. It's pretty creepy on it's own as they search the place, seen many ghost shows about abandoned hospitals. Anyways, the cannibals live there. It moves slow for awhile but does pick up in the middle to a bloody finale.Overall, a very well done film. Not a classic but very enjoyable. I don't usual question logic of horror but they should have shown what happens to the sanatorium. The inmates overtake it & it flash fowards 20-30 years. How did the brothers survive? where did the inmates go?

Well, I am soooooo glad to finally see this in a movie.  The ""innocents???"" who are always such incredible idiots and do so many stupid things that I can't help but to  feel they deserve to die.  In fact, it's only through their sheer stupidity that they're even in the situation to get killed and they just don't ever seem to get it so I feel no need to have these types survive only to produce idiot children.  They deserve to die!!! Unfortunately, there always seems to be a couple people who manage to survive and they're usually a male and female who never even knew each other before, but yet somehow form a romance in the midst of all the killing - now how stupid is that?  The killers aren't stupid at all.  They know exactly what's going on and in this movie they take care of business and kill them all. Anyway, at last a movie where THEY ALL DIE!!!

Thirty years later, a pack of partying college students make a wrong turn and end up camping out in the old abandoned asylum. Little do they know that its prior residents still live within its walls, and meat is back on the menu! WRONG TURN 4 presents itself as a prequel to the series, but then lazily jumps forward to the 2000's after a brief introduction of the infamous killers. It is clear from the beginning that SHARKTOPUS director Declan O'Brien is entirely unconcerned with the plot or characters, and that he is just using the shell of a film to put on another gory display. WRONG TURN 4 is just as bland and predictable as the third installment. It lacks the suspense of the original and the off-the-wall insanity of the second, leaving Slasher fans with nothing more than a few bloody kills and ample amounts of nudity. If you're in it for the gore, you get several decapitations, a giant drill through the chest, a human buffet, and countless missing limbs, but WRONG TURN 4 is nothing more than a mindless knock-off of the Norwegian hit COLD PREY.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,ILHM Reviews: Wrong Turn 4,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1254,"['1974', 'Glenville', 'Sanatorium', 'overrun', 'three', 'most', 'notorious', 'patients', 'inbred', 'cannibal', 'brothers', 'known', 'One', 'Eye', 'Three', 'Finger', 'Saw', 'Tooth', 'Thirty', 'years', 'later', 'pack', 'partying', 'college', 'students', 'make', 'wrong', 'turn', 'end', 'up', 'camping', 'out', 'old', 'abandoned', 'asylum', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'prior', 'residents', 'still', 'live', 'walls', 'meat', 'back', 'menu', 'WRONG', 'TURN', '4', 'presents', 'prequel', 'series', 'then', 'lazily', 'forward', '2000', 'brief', 'introduction', 'infamous', 'killers', 'clear', 'beginning', 'SHARKTOPUS', 'director', 'Declan', ""O'Brien"", 'entirely', 'unconcerned', 'plot', 'characters', 'just', 'using', 'shell', 'film', 'put', 'gory', 'display', 'WRONG', 'TURN', '4', 'just', 'bland', 'predictable', 'third', 'installment', 'suspense', 'original', 'off-the-wall', 'insanity', 'second', 'leaving', 'Slasher', 'fans', 'nothing', 'more', 'few', 'bloody', 'kills', 'ample', 'amounts', 'nudity', ""'re"", 'gore', 'get', 'several', 'decapitations', 'giant', 'drill', 'chest', 'human', 'buffet', 'countless', 'missing', 'limbs', 'WRONG', 'TURN', '4', 'nothing', 'more', 'mindless', 'knock-off', 'Norwegian', 'hit', 'COLD', 'PREY.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings

1460519,AWKRTLXGSNRES,B005GT3X68,"Donald C. Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[5, 7]","Wrong Turn (the original) was better than most of its genre.  I think Stan Winston did the makeup, and the movie carried an overall sense of dread and creepiness.  Wrong Turn 2 was enjoyable simply because of the casting of Henry Rollins.  Not as strong as the original, it still had its moments.  Wrong Turn 3 was where this series began its downward spiral.  Now, Wrong Turn 4:  Bloody Beginnings MAY kill the series.  Hopefully it does, because the producers have nowhere else to go with the idea.What's supposed to be ""beginnings,"" neither answers the questions of HOW the inbred cannabalistic hillbillies got started or how they procreated.  They kill everything in sight; how did they manage to breed when none of the three are female?  Supposedly set in an abandoned psychiatric hospital (it's AMAZING to me how many abandoned psychiatric hospitals there are), yet still fully functional as far as showers and electricity go, all you get in the fourth installment are some more gruesome killings (gruesome but NOT original) and more stupid decisions made by 25 year old ""teenagers"" to guarantee an early demise.

The first of this series was adventurous and somewhat genuine, with good acting and a solid script.  Unfortunately after that, it seemed to go downhill, with WT4 at the bottom.  The issue with WT4 is just about everything.  Part of this can be the fact this film obviously was done on a shoe string budget.  While this is pretty common for a film of this genre that is bypassing a theater near you, what it lacks even more, is effort.Perhaps taking some time to find more investors and getting a better overall crew and cast could have helped WT4.  Even the second and third installments of this Film Series did better, where the actors portrayed their characters with enough back story and purpose to make a viewer at least somewhat curious as to how their fates might play out.  A loaf of bread and a plywood plank getting thrown into a chainsaw covered in ketchup would have faired for more entertainment than what this film delves out.The antagonists of the story are not scary or even that sinister looking.  The trapped friends are supposed to be late teen/early twenty chums who are all couples and like to smoke weed.  That's believable, however none of these characters really has any depth or significance in the first place.  That creates a double whammy of ""WHO CARES"" when the juvenile gore fest style action scenes kill them off.

(So far, I've only liked/kept the first movie, I've tossed the rest.)Originality doesn't seem to be the filmmaker's goal, as proven by this nonsensical version of a well-worn plot device: trap a group of kids in an abandoned building and slowly kill them off one by one.  Who hasn't seen this gimmick used before?  In their case, they hedged a trifle by wondering aloud: when is a prison not a prison but a hospital instead?  I can't think of a single hospital with prison cells, I certainly wouldn't go to one that did!The biggest problem with the story this time out is the vast number of people that went romping through the wilderness during a snowstorm.  True, a large cast does mean a high body count.  However, when that number is so great that you can't remember one character from another, especially in the dark, that becomes a problem.  It also poses the question, with superior numbers why didn't they simply get rid of the three inbred idiots in the first place?  It also puts into question the type of education these college students were getting that they couldn't outsmart three inbred idiots?What did we learn from this movie?  Even if a building is ""creepy, warm, and dusty"", it's worth setting up residence for a night or two.  Always pass around booze found in a sanatorium.

Being able to see where everything started sounded interesting, especially since we were going to see the three main hillbilly characters shedding some blood as children.  The beginning seemed promising - c'mon, mental institutes with murderous crazies ALWAYS sounds like fun. But boy...was this movie bad.  The characters are ridiculous.  After a few minutes of ""terror"" at the opening of the movie, we then get to see some totally unnecessary sex.  Well, of course.  And not just one couple, but two, yay!  And there's even some lesbians! Well, given these facts, you know some deaths are about to incur...only, they're really boring deaths.  Even the most interesting one, the hillbillies version of The Melting Pot, lost my attention after ten seconds.  People can say this movie gives a shout out to female empowerment, but I totally disagree.  This is only said because all of the men are killed off first - however, these women are idiots.  I mean, pure rocks for brains.  They scream every 5 seconds, are stupid enough to stay in a room (though there's hundreds more in this large institute) that has a huge hole in the door, worry about snow clothes when all of their friends are being murdered, and then keep drifting away from each other throughout the entire movie...and these are only a few examples from a million depicting the lack of intelligence of the women in this movie.

But as far as direct-to-blu-rays go in the context of this genre it was pretty good. The movie includes lots of gore, enough T&A to make even Sean S. Cunningham blush and lots of melodramatic screaming by a slew of b-grade actors. I have only seen the first movie in the series besides this one and ""Wrong Turn 4"" is at least as good as the first one. A couple of standout performances that deserve an honorable mention... It was perhaps a stroke of genius casting Sean Skene as one of the annoying snow-mobilers and as one of the inbred cannibals in a dual role. And, although she started out superficial and shallow, Tenika Davis gave, perhaps the most impressive performance because her character was the most multi-faceted. Some scenes in the movie bordered on high-camp as it was obvious that the directors and producers were trying to shock audiences just as much as they were attempting to make audiences laugh (just think, when was the last time you saw a small group of deranged lunatics ballroom dancing, or fondueing a man alive?) The movie also had a really ""killer"" ending that was congruent to the entire over-the-top theme.

No matter how many bad sequels, awful remakes, and painful prequels Hollywood brings us, we just keep coming back for more. Case in point, ""Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings."" The original ""Wrong Turn"" was a fun if fairly derivative slice of hillbilly horror that struck the right cord with horror audiences. It was not a box office hit making just $16 million on a budget of $12 million but the film sold millions of dvds and we can thank it with starting the series that no one really asked for. ""Wrong Turn 2"" turns the tables by turning the first film into a reality show. It was fun, campy, and delightfully over-the-top. The less said about the third film the better. Now, eight years after the first installment, we have ""Wrong Turn 4"" a prequel that sets to up the stakes. But...does it succeed?The film opens in 1974 at the Glenville Sanatorium with Dr. Ryan (Arne McPherson) showing a local psychiatrist Dr. Ann McQuaid (Kristen Harris) around the psychiatric hospital. The cannibals from the previous films-One Eye, Three Finger, and Saw Tooth now are locked up in the institution as children. But the cannibals escapes and sets other insane patient free in the hospital. Then cannibals savagely murder an orderly, Guard, Dr. Ryan and Dr. McQuaid.The film then switches to present day where a group of college kids, Kenia (Jennifer Pudavick), lesbian couple Sara (Tenika Davis) and Bridget (Kaitlyn Wong), Lauren (Ali Tataryn), Jenna (Terra Vnesa), and Claire (Samantha Kendrick), along with their guy friends Kyle (Victor Zinck), Vincent (Sean Skene) and Daniel (Dean Armstrong) are going snowmobiling. They are heading to their friend Porter's cabin in the mountains. They get lost in a storm and seek refuge inside the now abandoned Glenville Sanatorium. Little do they know, the three now adult cannibals are hiding out in the sanatorium and murdering trespassers. The movie makes it unclear as to the whereabouts of rest of patients set free by cannibals.The group of teenagers explore the asylum, and decide to wait out the storm. After a montage of rolling around in wheelchairs, acting on illegal drugs, drinking booze and acting like teenagers, the storm still hasn't stopped so the teenagers are forced to sleep in the desolate building. In the middle of the night, Vincent, suffering from insomnia, walks around the asylum and finds Porter's mutilated body - apparently he didn't make it to his cabin either. He is then killed by Saw-Tooth having a metal rod shoved into his chin and out through the top of his head. The next morning, everyone discovers they are still snowed in, and Vincent is missing. The gang splits up to look for him, and Jenna witnesses the cannibals cutting Porter up. She runs back to tell the others and they all meet up in the auditorium. Something wrapped in Porter's jacket is thrown at them and Kenia opens it up to reveal Porter's severed head. Screaming and panicking, the group flocks around the door, trying to get out but the doors are locked. The three cannibals-up in the balcony, throw down a strip of barb-wire and loop it around Claire's neck, pulling her up to the balcony. Kyle tries to save her, but it is too late and the barb-wire tightens, severing Claire's head. Horrified, those who are left of them (Kenia, Sara, Bridget, Lauren, Jenna, Kyle and Daniel) run outside and try to escape on their snowmobiles, but the engines won't turn and it is revealed that the cannibals had stripped them of their spark plug wires. Lauren sets off to ski down the mountain to retrieve help and the other six run inside to try to defend themselves.""Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings"" is all sorts of lame. Bad CGI, atrocious acting, and thoroughly unlikable characters are just the start of this film's problems. When will filmmakers realize that when we don't like their characters, we don't care who lives and who dies. When we don't care, the movie is robbed of any and all suspense.

1460548,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005GT3X68,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","I saw the first film in this franchise some years ago when it arrived on DVD. I wasn't thrilled but I didn't hate the film either. It felt like they were taking the horror genre Wes Craven started with THE HILLS HAVE EYES, an inbred cannibalistic mutant family, and relocating it to the back hills of West Virginia. The location change shows Hollywood's contempt for anything found in flyover country. I think they still think DELIVERANCE was a documentary and that folks outside of New York and Los Angeles are all this way.But things progressed from there. With the quick return on investment from the first film a franchise was born and the sequels began. I had a hard time even finishing the second (and I'm not quite sure I did) and never bothered to seek out the third film. I wish the same could be said for the newest fourth film which is subtitled BLOODY BEGINNINGS.Yes they've decided the best way to go with this one is to take us back and show us where it all started. Never fear though even with this one we could still go back a few more years and have a part 5! Lucky us!The film opens in 1974 at a sanatorium where a new doctor is being shown around the facility. The head of the place takes her down the secluded hall where the worst patients are, including three inbred hillbillies from West Virginia. One had eaten 2 of his own fingers, another forked out his eyeball and eaten it and the last has filed his teeth into sharp points. All three suffer from a malady where they feel no pain. Of course another patient steals a hairpin from this new doctor, tosses it to the 3 brothers who then escape and let the rest of the inmates out to wreak havoc on the sanatorium and kill all in charge.Fast forward to 2003 and the obligatory nude sex scene introduces us to two couples enjoying one another's company. They're interrupted by a friend who enters and tells them they have 5 minutes to get dressed and ready and then she's leaving. The group is heading for a weekend in the woods at a cabin their friend owns. They take cars to a designated dropping point and decide, even though a terrible winter storm is on the way, to take their snow mobiles and head out.Of course they get lost and where to the end up? At the infamous sanatorium from the start of the film! They enter and are not surprised that the building is warm, thinking that of course someone takes care of the boiler in the place to make sure the pipes don't burst. After a series of stereotypical stupid ideas (""hey let's divide up and search the place!"") they turn in for the night, sleeping (and of course having sex) in various rooms.During the night the first victim is killed, one of the boyfriends who can't sleep and sneaking around the building comes upon the body of a friend who was separated from the group. The next morning when he can't be found they search for him only to have his girlfriend find the 3 cannibals snacking on his body.She runs screaming for the rest of them to get out but not before another is lassoed with a piece of barb wire which after a tug of war between the cannibals and her boyfriend decapitates here. With no winter clothing they can't leave so are forced to find a way to overcome the incredibly intelligent inbreds. Well, they seem incredibly intelligent compared to the stupid things these kids do.The movie is little more than a way to show off a body count and various gory set pieces. In the extras you discover that the movie was shot in 19 days and while the photography and technical aspects of it are pretty good, the whole set up and story makes you wonder if the money couldn't have been spent better elsewhere.I'm not a fan of movies that have been termed torture porn. I hated HOSTEL but at the same time appreciated the SAW films. At least those had some story behind them, some mystery to solve. Fans of this sort of film are not horror fans, they are body count fans. They live and breathe to watch some new form of torture or murder occur. That's not scary and honestly becomes quite boring after a while. And truth be told that's the biggest sin with this film. It's boring.If you're a fan of the series then by all means enjoy. If you like little more than watching the body count rise and various forms of blood gushing incidents happen then you'll like it. If you want a horror film though or something that doesn't have the dumbest group of kids around then pass it by.I leave you with one of the stupidest thing that happens in the movie. It irked me so I have to share it with you. The group, minus a few friends who've been killed, captures the 3 inbreds and one says he's going to kill them by lighting them on fire. Another tells him not to, that it will only drag him down to their level and they're above that. Needless to say he dozes off guarding them so they escape, kill him and later on the rest of the group. Yes they all die but then again if you noticed the title this is only the beginning and had they not then it would be the end, eh?",1,JUST WRONG,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,5001,"['saw', 'first',

In addition to poor acting, there are also poor makeup effects, and, of course, CGI blood, which is the bane of most horror aficionados.This film is supposed to act as a prequel, but it is so badly done that you often forget that these are supposed to be the same three mutants from the original film, especially since the poor makeup job draws a disconnect. There is nothing scary about the film, and there are no tense moments. There is only one cringe-inducing scene, and there another absolutely ridiculous scene that could have ended the film, but the last surviving male character allows himself to be talked back from killing the mutants over some strange and sudden debate over higher morality.Essentially, this film is only for completists who want to see all installments of the franchise, or those that are fans of bad horror movies; however, even the latter will probably be disappointed.",2,Poor attempt at continuing the franchise,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,1496,"['first', 'sequel', 'original', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'was', 'least', 'minor', 'hints', 'movie', 'was', 'making', 'fun', 'franchise', 'also', 'had', 'Henry', 'Rollins', 'who', 'always', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'overly', 'serious', 'B-rate', 'horror', 'movies', 'third', 'film', 'however', 'pretty', 'much', 'stop', 'trying.In', 'fourth', 'installment', 'everything', 'pretty', 'poor', 'fact', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'even', 'close', 'attempting', 'act', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'often', 'confuse', 'several', 'other', 'have', 'real', 'clue', 'characters', 'are', 'dating', 'other', 'characters', 'addition', 'poor', 'acting', 'are', 'also', 'poor', 'makeup', 'effects', 'course', 'CGI', 'blood', 'bane', 'most', 'horror', 'aficionados.This', 'film', 'supposed', 'act', 'prequel', 'so', 'badly', 'done', 'often', 'forget', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'same', 'three', 'mutants', 'original', 'film', 'especially', 'poor', 'makeup', 'job', 'disconnect', 'nothing', 'scary', 'film', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'only', 'one', 'cringe-inducing', 'scene', 'there', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'film', 'last', 'surviving', 'male', 'character', 'be', 'talked', 'back', 'killing', 'mutants', 'strange', 'sudden', 'debate', 'higher', 'morality.Essentially', 'film', 'only', 'completists', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'installments', 'franchise', 'are', 'fans', 'bad', 'horror', 'movies', 'however', 'even', 'latter', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed']",Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings

Some people may think it has been taken too far with the blood and dismemberments, but if you're a fan of the franchise, you will most likely appreciate that. In some ways it is funny to think that the hillbilly's have sort of 'calmed down' since this film (it's a prequel and they are more monstrous than in the originals).Definitely worth watching, and it was great to see a different setting.

The first film was glorified trash, but it was enjoyable despite its shortcomings.  The second film was an ultra-bloody blast that was better than the original, while the third film had its share of good things, but was overall disappointing.  This fourth entry, Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings, finds our favorite inbred hillbilly cannibals back to doing what they do, only this time it's in an abandoned mental ward where a group of sexy friends get stuck inside on a ski trip.  While that sounds ripe for bloody fun, Wrong Turn 4 is sadly dull.  The characters are unlikable (as are the actors playing them), the film is predictable, and there's a torture scene that seems to never end.  There's some great gore effects on display though, and the hillbilly clan makeup is disgustingly well-made, so the film isn't a total loss all things considered.

Now, some years later, a group of nine friends have made a ""Wrong Turn"" while snowmobiling and end up at the sanatorium where they decide to spend the night... everything is fine until one of the college kids goes missing and soon they discover that they will be running for there lives in a game of cat and mouse from the three mutant hillbillies that caused the chaotic torture and cannibalism all those years ago!Review: I did right another review for this movie but I changed it because when I read it some weeks later I totally disagreed with it! I also must mention that this movie is even better than the awesome trailer purposed it to be! First off I love the fact that this takes place during the winter and not many slasher movies do that especially when the first three films take place in the summer! The action was very crazy in my opinion the most suspenseful, crazy scene is when *Spoiler Alert* the girl is being strangled with barb wire and the boyfriend is trying to pull her down with blood pouring on him like crazy *End Spoiler*! A couple of scenes that I thought were very intense where the three young adults were running from three finger, and when the guy is being eaten alive like some sort of ""fondue"" by having his flesh torn off piece by piece and then having it fried and eaten on the spot! I do however still don't like how many lesbian sex scenes there were, I felt that they didn't need them as much but I will give props for when the movie first takes off towards the actual story the opening scene they chose to introduce some of the characters was an orgy between four people (A.K.A. three girls, one guy)! There were several atmospheres, one of which were being stuck in a corner in a dark room with all sorts of weapons around able to be killed with, that gives the impression of atmospheric fear and I admit when the movie began I felt that it was going to be extremely cheesy but it actually turned out quite superb and I will rank this movie along side parts one and two any day!Gore: An extremely graphic, intense barb wire strangling that leads to the individual's head to cut off from the neck stump, a messy multiple stabbing scene, some nasty extra decapitations, a woman is brutally rug burned from a snowmobile (very bloody), a long spike is shoved through somebody's nose and out there head, a person has there flesh fried and are slowly eaten piece by piece, a graphic hung and quartered scene, a woman's brain is fried (literally), a nose bitten off, a woman has a huge toy-like drill impaled through her back side (very gory) and much more! This is The Most Grotesque, Goriest, Grisly, Grubbiest, Grimiest, and Gruesome Wrong Turn Movie to This Date!Acting: I was very surprised at how the actors preformed there characters, it felt real, the only acting that wasn't bad but had a very annoying scream was the boyfriends hanging girl when he was trying to save her... I was laughing as much as I was screaming! The surviving aspect of the acting felt determined and that was very good! All in all it had a little over decent acting!Bottom Line: Now you are all probably wondering why I gave this a four out of five, it is because of the story, the scenery is great, and the plot was decent but the prequel-idea for the story had been done death.... other than that... I will dare say that this is one of my most favorite Wrong Turn movies out of them all!Rated R: for strong horror violence and gore, language, sexuality, and brief drug useIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 8For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 4 (it would be a 4 and a half out of 5 but alas the ratings on Amazon.Com wont let me!)P.S. I know this was also a bit cheesy, but that's what I knew what I was in store for, so watch this with an open mind and you'll most likely come out happy.",4,"The Most Grotesque, Goriest, Grisly, Grubbiest, Grimiest, and Gruesome Wrong Turn Movie to This Date",1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,4212,"['lot', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'likable', 'characters', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'creative', 'deaths', 'best', 'thing', 'deaths', 'were', ""n't"", 'all', 'covered', 'terrible', 'CGI', 'when', 'CGI', 'came', 'actually', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'Plot', '1974', 'sanatorium', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'had', 'workers', 'slaughtered', 'three', 'cannibalistic', 'mutant', 'hillbillies', 'Now', 'years', 'later', 'group', 'nine', 'friends', 'have', 'made', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'snowmobiling', 'end', 'up', 'sanatorium', 'where', 'decide', 'spend', 'night', 'everything', 'fine', 'one', 'college', 'kids', 'missing', 'soon', 'discover', 'will', 'be', 'running', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'three', 'mutant', 'hillbillies', 'caused', 'chaotic', 'torture', 'cannibalism', 'years', 'ago', 'Review', 'did', 'right', 'review', 'movie', 'changed', 'when', 'read', 'weeks', 'later', 'totally', 'disagreed', 'also', 'must', 'mention', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'awesome', 'trailer', 'purposed', 'be', 'First', 'love', 'fact', 'place', 'winter', 'not', 'many', 'slasher', 'movies', 'do', 'especially', 'when', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'summer', 'action', 'was', 'very', 'crazy', 'opinion', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'crazy', 'scene', 'when', '*Spoiler', 'Alert*', 'girl', 'being', 'strangled', 'barb', 'wire', 'boyfriend', 'trying', 'pull', 'down', 'blood', 'pouring', 'crazy', '*End', 'Spoiler*', 'A', 'couple', 'scenes', 'thought', 'were', 'very', 'intense', 'where', 'three', 'young', 'adults', 'were', 'running', 'three', 'finger', 'when', 'guy', 'being', 'eaten', 'alive', 'sort', 'fondue', 'having', 'flesh', 'torn', 'off', 'piece', 'piece', 'then', 'having', 'fried', 'eaten', 'spot', 'do', 'however', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'many', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'will', 'give', 'props', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'actual', 'story', 'opening', 'scene', 'chose', 'introduce', 'characters', 'was', 'orgy', 'four', 'people', 'A.K.A', 'three', 'girls', 'one', 'guy', 'were', 'several', 'atmospheres', 'one', 'were', 'being', 'stuck', 'corner', 'dark', 'room', 'sorts', 'weapons', 'able', 'be', 'killed', 'impression', 'atmospheric', 'fear', 'admit', 'when', 'movie', 'began', 'felt', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'extremely', 'cheesy', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'quite', 'superb', 'will', 'rank', 'movie', 'side', 'parts', 'one', 'two', 'day', 'Gore', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'intense', 'barb', 'wire', 'strangling', 'individual', 'head', 'cut', 'off', 'neck', 'stump', 'messy', 'multiple', 'stabbing', 'scene', 'nasty', 'extra', 'decapitations', 'woman', 'brutally', 'rug', 'burned', 'snowmobile', 'very', 'bloody', 'long', 'spike', 'shoved', 'somebody', 'nose', 'there', 'head', 'person', 'flesh', 'fried', 'are', 'slowly', 'eaten', 'piece', 'piece', 'graphic', 'hung', 'quartered', 'scene', 'woman', 'brain', 'fried', 'literally', 'nose', 'bitten', 'off', 'woman', 'huge', 'toy-like', 'drill', 'impaled', 'back', 'side', 'very', 'gory', 'much', 'more', 'Most', 'Grotesque', 'Goriest', 'Grisly', 'Grubbiest', 'Grimiest', 'Gruesome', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Movie', 'Date', 'Acting', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'actors', 'preformed', 'characters', 'felt', 'real', 'only', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'had', 'very', 'annoying', 'scream', 'was', 'boyfriends', 'hanging', 'girl', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'save', 'was', 'laughing', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'screaming', 'surviving', 'aspect', 'acting', 'felt', 'determined', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'had', 'little', 'decent', 'acting', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Now', 'are', 'probably', 'wondering', 'why', 'gave', 'four', 'five', 'story', 'scenery', 'great', 'plot', 'was', 'decent', 'prequel-idea', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'other', 'will', 'dare', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'movies', 'Rated', 'R', 'strong', 'horror', 'violence', 'gore', 'language', 'sexuality', 'brief', 'drug', 'useIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '8For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '4', 'would', 'be', '4', 'half', '5', 'alas', 'ratings', 'Amazon.Com', 'wont', 'let', 'P.S', 'know', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'what', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'store', 'so', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'come', 'out', 'happy']",Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings

1460571,A1ZCMOW8Q6E71X,B005GT3X68,"Ted E. Kissel ""Ted Kissel""","[5, 8]","First off I would like to make it perfectly clear that I am a huge fan of the Wrong Turn movies.  I saw the first one, loved it, and became even move impressed by the second.  And I loved the new traps, blood, and gore in the third Wrong Turn.  But this one is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen.  It disgraces the Wrong Turn movies more then American Pie Presents Band Camp or even American Pie Presents The Book Of Love (A film I won't even see because it has gotten so many bad reviews) disgraces and insults the American Pie movies.  IN THIS REVIEW I WILL POINTS OUT THE MISTAKES ONE BY ONE IN NUMBERS.MISTAKE 1 (the beginning of the movie)-At the beginning of this movie you see an insane asylum that seems worse then even your typical insane asylum with Dr. Brendon Ryan showing Dr. Ann Marie McQuaid (a psychologist) where the cannibals from the Wrong Turn series are kept in the insane asylum, in the year 1974.  You see Dr. Ryan telling Dr. McQuaid about how the cannibals in the movie were found eating their parents in the woods of West Virginia causing them to be locked up where they have eaten a few of their own body parts and that was the only thing this movie did right to live up to it's name.  Doctor Ryan also talks about how the cannibals are smart and have a disorder that allows them to fell no pain what so ever.  After that scene it was like the idiot director and creator of the film decided to ruin the fun of the cannibals trying to escape form the mental institute (as if they hadn't already made a mistake by not showing them in the woods eating their parents, getting captured, and taken to the insane asylum), by just having one cannibal throw what seemed to be a vintage 1960's hair barrette to the smarter cannibals in another jail cell allowing them to pick their cell lock.  After the cannibals pick the lock, a guard comes into where they escaped and is eaten by them.  Then the cannibals who picked the lock open all the other cannibals cells and chaos breaks out.  And as you might guess even though it only shows the cannibals killing Dr. Ryan and Dr. McQuaid they kill everyone and that's the end of their time with the insane asylum and anywhere in the movie from 1974-2002.MISTAKE 2 (the time period the rest of this movie takes place in)-Next the director takes you to a college in West Virginia where a bunch of students are in a dorm getting ready to go up to a cabin in the mountains for a ski trip in the year 2003.  Then the group of college students going to the cabin on a ski trip, as you might guess park their car, ride snow mobiles, get lost in a severe snow storm trying to find the cabin and end up settling in at the insane asylum out in the middle of no where the cannibals escaped form in 1974.  Again dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb every single movie that takes place in the past it seems like takes place in this past decade.  Why?  This past decade wasn't that great, sure the internet & cell phone technology from the 1990's was developing tremendously, but the economy was bad and it didn't have the good fashion statements, images, design styles, and fads the past decades did.  Plus the music scene from this past decade is by far the worst ever.  And worst of all the first Wrong Turn movie was made the same year this piece of crap took place talk about a hole in one screw up.  Why not just have the movie take place in the 1970's, 80's or 90's?MISTAKE 3 (The college students seemed to vulnerable)-When the college students in this film decide to spend the night in the cannibals abandon insane asylum out in the middle of no where during a severe snow storm where their cell phones don't work, they park their snow mobiles in front of it and one student (Porter) is instructed to bring their bags into the insane asylum.  Then all the college students except the one (Porter) bringing in the over night bags make it into the insane asylum.  Next you see 3 cannibals have killed Porter before he had a chance to bring in the over night bags and are taking his body into the insane asylum.  Then you see the rest of the college students exploring the insane asylum, turning on the power, getting drunk off Dr. Ryan's scotch, getting stoned, finding an old 1970's film canister containing brutal therapy treatment to one of the cannibals and watching it on a projection screen.  Then one college student tells the rest about the Wrong Turn cannibals legend.  Then all the college students except one (Vincent) get a good nights rest.  As you might guess Vincent was killed in the night because he decided to wonder off.  OK, lets be completely honest here, after seeing the first 3 Wrong Turn films do we really think the cannibals are going to let the college students get a good night's rest?  And do we really think they would kill the toughest target in the one college student who is up first?  And how much time do we really think the Cannibals would take to dismantle the college kids snow mobiles and take there belongings before they decide to hunt them?MISTAKE 4 (All the college kids except 4 (3 killed by the cannibals) have a chance to kill them and they don't do it)-The college students find out about the cannibals when they see them killing one of the college student's girl friend's with a barb wire noose, they run to their snow mobiles and find out they don't work.  Then one of the college kids goes off skiing through the woods of the cannibals insane asylum to find help.  The rest of the college kids are stuck in the insane asylum trying to defend them selves from the cannibals with sharp object type weapons they find in the basement of the insane asylum.  A little over half way though the film, you see the college kid who went off skiing to find help freezing her but off near a small fire she made that ends up being put out by a snow drift.  Then you see the rest of the college students except for 2 of them lure the 3 cannibals through a fire trap with their weapons into a jail cell, close the door, and lock it.  Then you see the one male college student who hasn't been killed by the cannibals pouring kerosene into the jail cell the cannibals are trapped in getting ready to burn them to death with a cigarette lighter have a sudden change of heart from words said to him by his friends causing him to change his mind about killing the cannibals after the cannibals had kept their mouth's shut (when asked) about the parts they had taken off the college kids snow mobiles to dismantle them.  OK, would any of the rest of the people the cannibals are hunting in the other Wrong Turn movies have done the same in this situation?MISTAKE 5 (The ending)-OK time for the ending, it's pretty simple everyone dies.  2 girls are killed by one of the cannibals traps at the very end and the girl who went off skiing ends up freezing to death.  Then after the 2 girls are killed you see one of the cannibals drive the toe truck they had in the other Wrong Turn movies to retrieve their remains.  Good job not showing us how the cannibals got their toe truck Mr. idiot director, producer, and screen writer.  Yeah I take it the cannibals lived in the cabin they lived in, in the first Wrong Turn too another thing that wasn't shown to us in this film.So basically all in all Wrong Turn 4 (The Beginnings) does not live up to it's title one bit, is basically just a crappy remake of the first Wrong Turn, and should have been done like this:-Starts off in the 1960's showing the cannibals being born and possibly them being kicked out of school (who knows they could have been home schooled before they ate their parents anyways).-Show's them going to the insane asylum for eating their parents in the late 1960's early 1970's.-The movie should have shown the cannibals escaping and starting what they did in all the other Wrong Turns in the mid 1970's.  There they could have shown how the Cannibals got their toe truck instead of just bringing it in out of no where at the end of the movie at basically the same time the first Wrong Turn took place.-And in the end the insane asylum should have been burned down and at least one person should have survived.If you want a good movie about the beginning's of a monster in a horror film I would strongly not recommend this garbage.  Instead I would recommend the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning, Rob Zombie's Halloween, or Tremors 4.And on my final note even though it's completely off topic, I would like to send a message out to the idiots who made this garbage Wrong Turn 4 movie.  What's next for you idiots, making a movie about the video game The Final Fight (A film that should clearly take place in the early 1990's), having Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson play Andore (someone who clearly should be played by Dalip ""The Great Kali"" Singh Rana with his skin lightened tremendously) and having it take place when this piece of crap garbage Wrong Turn 4 movie took place?",1,DO NOT

A doctor is giving a new female doctor a tour and introduces the three inbred hillbilly cannibals. They don't feel pain. When they were discovered they were chewing on their parents. Their escape is inevitable (it would be a short film if they stayed locked up). And in classic horror movie form the inmates become the keepers. The battle for the sanitarium is done in style, to the background of classical music (""The Blue Danube""), reminiscent of the violence scenes in ""Clockwork Orange."" They ironically perform electroshock therapy on the woman doctor (Kristen Harris) who wanted to use ""music therapy"" on them. I'm loving it. (Okay ""The Blue Danube"" was in ""2001..."" and not ""Clockwork Orange"", but I think you get the idea.) Terrific blood and gore. Hillbilly cannibals are jumping around and grunting like a Monthy Python Mr. Gumby brain specialist, looking like demented Klingons. And this is all before the opening credits!After the credits, the movie starts out ala Roger Corman style with a nude scene to set the tone for the picture. There are 4 people having sex and one girl not having sex. According to the unwritten slasher code of horror movies the 4 having sex must die and the lone girl who didn't show us her tatas will survive the upcoming snow mobile adventure. But to make this thing interesting there are 8-9 young adults total. If you have read the story line, you know they lose their way and spend the night at the abandoned sanitarium. The kids get drunk and stoned as they explore the place and read medical records for entertainment.

When three ""special"" boys who are brought to an insane asylum escape the reign on terror from the ""Hillbilly Cannibals"" begins. I will start by saying that this was much better then the third one. This movie further supports my argument that Hollywood is out of ideas and is stuck on prequels/sequels, re-makes and comic book movies only. If you don't believe me, ask yourself how long you have been saying...""I wish they made a prequel to 'Wrong Turn', the saga doesn't feel complete."" That's what I thought. This movie is just a lot of screaming, blood and decapitations. Oh yeah, and cannibalism. If you are into that sort of thing this is the movie you have been waiting for. Overall, much better then the third, my favorite was the second...but again I don't think a prequel to this series was needed.

1460577,A12LKEM543ILBK,B005GT3X68,zombie phreak,"[21, 26]","This was just stupid!***SPOILERS***You mean to tell me that in this sanitarium that there are no guards and that they have NO contingency plans for if the inmates get out of their cells?  Okay, why not?  But on top of that, NO ONE goes investigating when there is no word from the sanitarium, or when the people who work there don't come home at night?  No one investigates this at all?  Maybe if this was the 1700's that might be believable, but this is MODERN times.So then our dumb main characters show up, and frankly I watched this 12 hours ago and as I sit here I can only remember ONE character's name, ""Vincent"" cuz they were yelling it over and over again.  When I can't remember the characters names it's a real failure on the part of the writer because it means there is nothing memorable about them.So they come across this abandoned nut house and they just decide to barge on in because it's getting cold out and there's no other place to go.  Okay, why didn't they just follow the road that's leading to that place and take it back to civilization?  Guess it doesn't fit into the plot.  Also what happened to all the other inmates we saw at the beginning of the movie?  If the main villains ate them, just establish it by having them find a pile of bones or something.So they party at this nut house loud and hard and these crazies just let them?  Okay...  Then they start killing these college students one at a time and frankly deserve it for how stupid they are.  Why don't they just get into a room with a window, and barricade the hell out of it, stay there until the snow stops and then make a run for it when it's clear outside?  Again I guess that makes too much sense.Also, where the hell did these nut jobs get an ice auger?  You mean to tell me that it was just laying around the sanitarium somewhere?  On top of that you mean to tell me that these back water hill billies who are mentally retarded and have been locked in a nut house for years know how to take apart and put back together the inner workings of a snowmobile!?!  And on top of THAT, they know how to ride them!?!  How does that make sense!?!Plus if that wasn't enough, these college students FINALLY trap these guys in a cell, lock them in there and they finally have the upper hand.  One of the students douses them in kerosene and is about to light them on fire and end this nightmare, but one of the air-headed bimbos pipes up and says, ""We can't kill them!!!""  Why not!?!  They just MURDERED your friends!!!  And if you don't kill them, they are going to get out and kill YOU and the rest of your friends!  Use your brain, it's kill or be killed!!!So of course the students fall asleep, the crazies get out and kill them all.  Movie ends.  Oh, one after thought, where the hell did they get all this barbed wire!?!***END SPOILERS***So not only is this movie just totally unbelievable and just non-nonsensical in all forms, but you can't see half of it!  Seriously!!!  I have a brand new flat screen that I just bought 6 months ago that I can watch other movies just fine on and see everything, so it's not my TV.  Half of the action scenes take place in the dark and you can't even see what is happening or who it is happening to!  I admit that this worked for some movies like Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity, but in an ACTION movie, if I can't see what's happening, it's not scary!  It's just annoying!!!  I don't wanna have to use my imagination when I'm watching a horror/action movie!  I should be able to see what's happening so I can follow the story!I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this and just got it outta the Red Box.
