916203,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0009X7BG4,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I should have expected this to be semi-mediocre when I popped it in.  I find &#8216;Breaking Away&#8217; to be vastly overrated, and Penn&#8217;s directorial efforts aren&#8217;t the most consistent (he fit in nicely with &#8216;The Miracle Worker&#8217;, but a recent viewing of &#8216;Bonnie and Clyde&#8217; shone a spotlight on its many flaws).  This character study centering on four friends growing up in the 60&#8217;s has a lot going for it, but it all feels so amateurishly constructed.  The performances are either too much or too little, lacking balance and conviction, and the screenplay panders and fails to make a real impact.  It all just came and went with little to show, and Penn&#8217;s knack for turning things into a soap opera didn&#8217;t help much at all.  Maybe I just don&#8217;t connect with the time, place or era depicted, and yet that can&#8217;t be it since I have in the past.  A good movie is a good movie, and sadly a bad one cannot hide behind nostalgia.

916204,A2JBVRCJ8VS7PQ,B0009X7BG4,Jerry (Celil) Parker,"[0, 0]","I admire intensely and love this film, ""Four Friends"" (the DVD widescreen edition of it which I own and that I have viewed being Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Home Entertainment 4008665, also being the number 1008936). It truly is one of the great motion pictures about American identity. However, I felt considerable confusion due to the inappropriate depiction of the age of the Yugoslavian immigrant boy, Danilo. He is depicted coming to the U.S. at about twelve or so, he and his mother reunited with their father, who already had been in the U.S. for some time. One would assume that this happen in the immediate post-war period; the styles, cars, and so forth seem to be redolent of the late 1940s when the boy arrives. However, for him to be a ""baby boomer"", he would have had to be born no earlier than 1946 and the lad clearly is a child of the latter part of the 1930s. I wish that there were a novel or play upon which the film were based to clear that up! (But the film's script was not based upon a prior printed work from what I understand.) Perhaps Danilo and his mother really do arrive later after the war than the film visually seems to suggest, making Danilo a newly arrived twelve-year-old in the 1950s.Having myself been born during W.W.-2, too early to be a real ""boomer"", I only was lucky enough to be swept up into the later 1960s culture, participating in it with somewhat younger university students than myself (although I looked as boyish as most of them), from having had to do military service during the Kennedy presidency, and then afterwards to work for a few years between junior college and university (at U. Mass. Boston and Kent State U.). I developed, due to that lapse in my own and my friends' ages (albeit looking really no older than they), the stance of being something of an observer as much as a participant in the doings of the youth culture of the late 1960s and the 1970s, being ""The Camera"" as a lady friend called me! I mention that because something of the kind could be Danilo's situation, too, if he has been placed with younger children than himself during his public school years in Indiana. He seems to be the same age as his friends, however, as the film depicts him. It is rather a pity that the movie is not clearer about these matters!Anyway, the movie is incredibly true to the era (1950s and 1960s) that it in largest part depicts. It catches not just the styles and external trappings of those years, but the social and political tensions, the quandaries of those years that American youth had to face. The cruelest manifestation of that, of course, is the unbridgeable conflict between Danilo's well-born bride and her father, who is some kind of bitter old Goldwater Republican (that's my interpretation, since the film is not so explicit as that) who just cannot accept the new order of things in those times, especially within his own family; atop that, there is an hint of father-daughter incest, too, that has flashed past shortly before the scene of the wedding reception. The devastating triumph of the ""Neo-Conservatives"" to come with the second term of Pres. Clinton onwards down through ""Prez' Obawumpa"" and, one fears, beyond, shows how the detestable values of the likes of Barry Goldwater era, alas, would come to prevail, to the destruction of American political culture and to a perversion of values in the late 1990s and opening decades of the 21st century, years before which, perhaps thankfully, the 1981 film is too early to have been able to portray unless the director would have risked doing that in a futuristic way. The old man, Danilo's bride's wealthy father, asserts himself in the most appallingly violent way, something that sets Danilo back on his luck for years to follow, among other consequences. To mention how that happens would be too much of a ""spoiler"" for those who have yet to experience this motion picture.Through all the changes of the times that Georgia, for her part mostly blithely, and her friends/lovers undergo, she is the most ""hip"" and ""with it"" barometer of the shifting mood of the times through which she and the others pass. Danilo himself, as an immigrant male, despite his outward assimilation to American life, poses a kind of steady gauge compared to her, never trying to define himself merely as the culture impels the others to do, who in varying ways pass from one phase to another (as Georgia herself does), while it is steadfast Danilo who sees the irony of it all.This film is a masterwork, however relatively ignored it has been over the decades. It is one such film of lasting value that any lover of the cinematic art owes it to himself to discover and to savour!",5,"Great Film, Despite What Seems Like a Chronological Contradiction Regarding Danilo, the Immigrant Son",1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,4685,"['admire', 'intensely', 'love', 'film', 'Four', 'Friends', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'edition', 'own', 'have', 'viewed', 'being', 'Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer', 'Home', 'Entertainment', '4008665', 'also', 'being', 'number', '1008936', 'truly', 'one', 'great', 'motion', 'pictures', 'American', 'identity', 'However', 'felt', 'considerable', 'confusion', 'due', 'inappropriate', 'depiction', 'age', 'Yugoslavian', 'immigrant', 'boy', 'Danilo', 'depicted', 'coming', 'U.S.', 'about', 'twelve', 'so', 'mother', 'reunited', 'father', 'who', 'already', 'had', 'been', 'U.S.', 'time', 'One', 'would', 'assume', 'happen', 'immediate', 'post-war', 'period', 'styles', 'cars', 'so', 'forth', 'seem', 'be', 'redolent', 'late', '1940s', 'when', 'boy', 'However', 'be', 'baby', 'boomer', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'be', 'born', 'earlier', '1946', 'lad', 'clearly', 'child', 'latter', 'part', '1930s', 'wish', 'were', 'novel', 'play', 'film', 'were', 'based', 'clear', 'up', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'not', 'based', 'prior', 'printed', 'work', 'what', 'understand', 'Perhaps', 'Danilo', 'mother', 'really', 'do', 'arrive', 'later', 'war', 'film', 'visually', 'suggest', 'making', 'Danilo', 'newly', 'arrived', 'twelve-year-old', '1950s.Having', 'been', 'born', 'W.W.-2', 'too', 'early', 'be', 'real', 'boomer', 'only', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'swept', 'up', 'later', '1960s', 'culture', 'participating', 'somewhat', 'younger', 'university', 'students', 'looked', 'as', 'boyish', 'most', 'having', 'had', 'do', 'military', 'service', 'Kennedy', 'presidency', 'then', 'afterwards', 'work', 'few', 'years', 'junior', 'college', 'university', 'U', 'Mass', 'Boston', 'Kent', 'State', 'U.', 'developed', 'due', 'lapse', 'own', 'friends', 'ages', 'looking', 'really', 'older', 'stance', 'being', 'something', 'observer', 'as', 'much', 'participant', 'doings', 'youth', 'culture', 'late', '1960s', '1970s', 'being', 'Camera', 'lady', 'friend', 'called', 'mention', 'something', 'kind', 'could', 'be', 'Danilo', 'situation', 'too', 'been', 'placed', 'younger', 'children', 'public', 'school', 'years', 'Indiana', 'be', 'same', 'age', 'friends', 'however', 'film', 'rather', 'pity', 'movie', 'not', 'clearer', 'matters', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'true', 'era', '1950s', '1960s', 'largest', 'part', 'not', 'just', 'styles', 'external', 'trappings', 'years', 'social', 'political', 'tensions', 'quandaries', 'years', 'American', 'youth', 'had', 'face', 'cruelest', 'manifestation', 'course', 'unbridgeable', 'conflict', 'Danilo', 'well-born', 'bride', 'father', 'who', 'kind', 'bitter', 'old', 'Goldwater', 'Republican', 'interpretation', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'explicit', 'who', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'new', 'order', 'things', 'times', 'especially', 'own', 'family', 'hint', 'father-daughter', 'incest', 'too', 'flashed', 'past', 'shortly', 'scene', 'wedding', 'reception', 'devastating', 'triumph', 'Neo-Conservatives', 'come', 'second', 'term', 'Pres', 'Clinton', 'onwards', 'down', 'Prez', 'Obawumpa', 'one', 'fears', 'how', 'detestable', 'values', 'likes', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', 'era', 'alas', 'would', 'come', 'prevail', 'destruction', 'American', 'political', 'culture', 'perversion', 'values', 'late', '1990s', 'opening', 'decades', '21st', 'century', 'years', 'perhaps', 'thankfully', '1981', 'film', 'too', 'early', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'portray', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'risked', 'doing', 'futuristic', 'way', 'old', 'man', 'Danilo', 'bride', 'wealthy', 'father', 'most', 'appallingly', 'violent', 'way', 'something', 'Danilo', 'back', 'luck', 'years', 'follow', 'other', 'consequences', 'mention', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'spoiler', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'experience', 'motion', 'changes', 'times', 'Georgia', 'part', 'mostly', 'blithely', 'friends/lovers', 'undergo', 'most', 'hip', 'barometer', 'shifting', 'mood', 'times', 'others', 'pass', 'Danilo', 'immigrant', 'male', 'outward', 'assimilation', 'American', 'life', 'kind', 'steady', 'gauge', 'compared', 'never', 'trying', 'define', 'merely', 'culture', 'others', 'do', 'who', 'varying', 'ways', 'pass', 'one', 'phase', 'Georgia', 'steadfast', 'Danilo', 'who', 'irony', 'all.This', 'film', 'masterwork', 'however', 'relatively', 'ignored', 'been', 'decades', 'one', 'such', 'film', 'lasting', 'value', 'lover', 'cinematic', 'art', 'discover', 'savour']",N/A

Silver ""Major Fan""","[4, 7]","The best way to tell you how pleased I am that this is FINALLY being released on DVD is to post my comments over the years(...)Will some company PLEASE make a DVD of this film!???27 March 2005Author: jim6263 &lt;/user/ur3773358/comments> from So.California, USAWill some company PLEASE make a (good+) DVD of this film!???  Aside from being a wonderful film about relationships and friendships, ""Four Friends"" is the ONLY film I've ever seen -- And I have, literally, spent *years* of my life watching films! -- that captures the essence of the 60s experience (and I was there!): the idealism, the hope, the freedom, the confusion, the betrayals, and ultimately its upbeat but bittersweet denouement.  And all of this is accomplished without being a story about any of the numerous upheavals of that era, although many are just touched upon... as part of the tapestry.  But the story is primarily about the characters and their friendship over about 10~15 years... and that those survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade.  Absolutely a joy and must-see film... even if one's not an old hippie!!!Re: the slew of new comments, 26 July 2001Author: scrypter &lt;/user/ur0534625/comments>I watched it again tonight (once or twice a year); and it got me curious re: what new comments were here, if any.  I'm both pleased and surprised to see the relative glut of new reviews -- which do NOT add up to a 6.1 rating, btw!!! -- for this most excellent film.  I guess it was released on video...FINALLY!!!?In a comment dated 18 June 2001, Nozz wrote: Melville said that ""Moby Dick"" was only ""a sketch of a sketch""... the book illuminated so many avenues that it never took time to explore.  So too with ""Four Friends."" ... So it's a little unfair, but there's a sense of missed opportunity because everything in this movie is so good that it seems to deserve more attention.I think that's part of the point/its poignancy and bittersweet sense of loss at the end, which is what makes it so evocative; as so is life -- small moments of apparently frivolous experience/choices/opportunities -- which will rarely, if ever, come again; and certainly not while we are the same.  We always think of/were taught the 20/20 hindsight bit; but there's NO guarantee path ""x"" would have been more ideal/fruitfil/ better than path ""y""!  One can never KNOW w/o taking the path/making (whatever) choice -- Talking about good things here, not stupid things like OD'ing on some lame chemical or suicide!  Can't speak for today's youths -- As it is indeed a far different, more cynical world!! -- but given the idealism, hope, and energy inherent in the 60s youth, who wanted to LIVE (after so much repression)...... and experience everything, a legacy of feeling loss was inevitable.  There's just not enough time being young.  I never grew tired of being young, as long as my body was!  That's not to say many/most did not have many good times, even wonderful lives and families.  But the ideals we hoped for the world certainly didn't materialize; and few realized it in their personal lives, I suspect, at least on the broad scale we hoped.  And for that, we greive; for few have the choice. ""Four Friends,"" as does few films, conveys that loss so splendidly and the rewards of the remaining, though not ideal, friendships -- whose importance in our lives is timeless.  And yeah, it always elicits tears and longing for what could have been.  Someday it will be recognized, I hope, for the great film it is!Still a sleeper...... sorry to say!, 11 December 1999Author: scrypter &lt;/user/ur0534625/comments>Granted it's alleged that we romanticize the past and I've always loved films -- My video collection is 1,500 (all good+!) and I have an affinity for nostalgic films -- (I also love ""Peggy Sure Got Married,"" to name but one) even though there's not much I liked (for real) in/about the 50s (exc. H.S.).  But I'd go back to the 60s in a heartbeat (angst and all), even if I had to go back to who I was -- not a pleasant prospect -- although my preference would be to go knowing what I know/being who I am now.  I'd therefore not miss such sublime opportunities as that which young Danilo Prozor was offered by Georgia. ""Four Friends"" is really the only film I've ever seen that sums up the personal essence of the 60s so well -- the uncertainty, hope, idealism, searching, (specific) emotional baggage, heartbreak of reality, love, and friendship.  Certainly every generation shares versions of these feelings and loves films which elicit them!?  However, ""Four Friends"" does all this by the use of carefully-chosen (I assume) metaphors and without -- perhaps because of not -- delving into all the socio-political turbulence/unrest.  I saw ""Four Friends"" first run in a very sparsely populated theater.  Can't really say why it bombed; I haven't a clue.  But I loved it then, and still do; it's a profoundly rich story/film!!",5,AT LAST... a gift for MOST generations!!!,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,4934,"['best', 'way', 'tell', 'how', 'pleased', 'am',

916206,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B0009X7BG4,Randy Keehn,"[2, 7]","I watched ""Four Friends"" because of praise that I had read of it.  I noted a lot of very positive reviews here on Amazon.com.  Let me candidly give my differing impression; this movie is incoherent and ""over the top"".  The film begins in an earlier time that what I expected.  We are led to understand that we are seeing the reunion of a family that immigrated seperately.  The family is a bit dysfunctional which, I suppose, was a key element to understanding the 1960's and 70's; i.e. generations that were not communicating with each other.  We jump shift to high school senior year and focus on four main characters.  The film's title did more than the film did at that point to have us understand that these are four close friends.  We accept the premise that they are friends and listen to their dreams of becoming something special, each in their own way.  We see a high school career program that suggests that East Chicago offers only steel mill and/or military professions.  This does not wash with the students's expectations so they rebell...why?  If you don't want to work in a steel mill does that mean that a protest demonstration is the way to express your opinion?  A senior kegger is going fine until it turns into a race riot.  A wedding reception turns into a...well, you decide for yourself what happened there.  Things like that kept making me wonder why everyone reacts so bombastically and, sometimes, violently.These four friends really are just two friends.  The other two serve as straight men for the rather comic relationship that the main couple have.  Along the way others move in and out all the while giving us a kaleidescope of the youth of that generation.  I found myself embarrassed at times to think I supposedly grew up with these people.  Many of us WERE cliches back then but it seemed that just about everyone was a cliche in ""Four Friends"".  If the writer and the director meant ""Four Friends"" to be a farce on the 60's and 70's, I'd say they succeeded.  If, however, they meant the movie to be an explanation of that era, they failed mainly because they left us with the impression that everyone in it failed.  I found it hard to identify with anyone in this movie and this was (and still is) my generation.This nation is still dealing with the leadership and influence of people who learned life's lessons in that time.  We are the generation in power and some of us learned the right lessons and discarded, in time, the wrong ones.  There is an ongoing debate (at least I THINK there is) in this country as to what were the right lessons and what were the wrong ones.  I realize that ""Four Friends"" is not responsible for identifying or solving all the issues that arose with this generation.  I understand that the movie was too close to the period it described to have any real perspective.  However, I had the feeling that the writer and the director had a purpose.  I just couldn't figure out what it was.  I guess their statement was just too incoherent and ""over the top"".",3,Second Opinion,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,3024,"['watched', 'Four', 'Friends', 'praise', 'had', 'read', 'noted', 'lot', 'very', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'Let', 'candidly', 'give', 'differing', 'impression', 'movie', 'incoherent', 'top', 'film', 'earlier', 'time', 'what', 'expected', 'are', 'led', 'understand', 'are', 'seeing', 'reunion', 'family', 'immigrated', 'seperately', 'family', 'bit', 'dysfunctional', 'suppose', 'was', 'key', 'element', 'understanding', '1960', '70', 'i.e', 'generations', 'were', 'not', 'communicating', 'other', 'jump', 'shift', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'year', 'focus', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'title', 'did', 'more', 'film', 'did', 'point', 'have', 'understand', 'are', 'four', 'close', 'friends', 'accept', 'premise', 'are', 'friends', 'listen', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'something', 'special', 'own', 'way', 'see', 'high', 'school', 'career', 'program', 'East', 'Chicago', 'only', 'steel', 'mill', 'and/or', 'military', 'professions', 'not', 'wash', 'students', 'expectations', 'rebell', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'work', 'steel', 'mill', 'mean', 'protest', 'demonstration', 'way', 'express', 'opinion', 'A', 'senior', 'kegger', 'going', 'fine', 'race', 'riot', 'wedding', 'reception', 'well', 'decide', 'what', 'happened', 'there', 'Things', 'kept', 'making', 'wonder', 'why', 'everyone', 'so', 'bombastically', 'sometimes', 'violently.These', 'four', 'friends', 'really', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'friends', 'other', 'two', 'serve', 'straight', 'men', 'rather', 'comic', 'relationship', 'main', 'couple', 'have', 'way', 'others', 'move', 'while', 'giving', 'kaleidescope', 'youth', 'generation', 'found', 'embarrassed', 'times', 'think', 'supposedly', 'grew', 'up', 'people', 'Many', 'WERE', 'back', 'then', 'seemed', 'just', 'everyone', 'was', 'cliche', 'Four', 'Friends', 'writer', 'director', 'meant', 'Four', 'Friends', 'be', 'farce', '60', '70', ""'d"", 'say', 'succeeded', 'however', 'meant', 'movie', 'be', 'explanation', 'era', 'failed', 'mainly', 'left', 'impression', 'everyone', 'failed', 'found', 'hard', 'identify', 'anyone', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'generation.This', 'nation', 'still', 'dealing', 'leadership', 'influence', 'people', 'who', 'learned', 'life', 'lessons', 'time', 'are', 'generation', 'power', 'learned', 'right', 'lessons', 'discarded', 'time', 'wrong', 'ones', 'ongoing', 'debate', 'least', 'THINK', 'country', 'what', 'were', 'right', 'lessons', 'were', 'wrong', 'ones', 'realize', 'Four', 'Friends', 'not', 'responsible', 'identifying', 'solving', 'issues', 'arose', 'generation', 'understand', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'close', 'period', 'described', 'have', 'real', 'perspective', 'However', 'had', 'feeling', 'writer', 'director', 'had', 'purpose', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'guess', 'statement', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'incoherent', 'top']",N/A

Horwatt,"[3, 3]","If you're lucky enough to have seen this movie, you've probably had the experience of telling dozens of people about it, and receiving blank looks in response.  It's one of those great movies that no one seems to have seen.It covers a decade (the 1960's) in the lives of four friends, with most of the emphasis being on two of them (Danny and Georgia).  It covers so much ground that it's difficult to describe:  love, friendship, sex, social issues, coming of age, defining yourself, what is worth fighting for, etc.  IT CONTAINS THE FUNNIEST BARFIGHT EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE. It contains one of the most surprising plot turns I have ever seen (if you see this coming, my hat is off to you).  I cry and laugh every time I watch it.It also manages to profoundly show the various conflicts that ripped at the fabric of American society in the 60's without trashing America itself.Just get it.",5,The most awesome movie you've never heard of,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,903,"[""'re"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'had', 'experience', 'telling', 'dozens', 'people', 'receiving', 'blank', 'looks', 'response', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'one', 'have', 'seen.It', 'covers', 'decade', '1960', 'lives', 'four', 'friends', 'most', 'emphasis', 'being', 'two', 'Danny', 'Georgia', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'difficult', 'describe', 'love', 'friendship', 'sex', 'social', 'issues', 'coming', 'age', 'defining', 'what', 'worth', 'fighting', 'etc', 'IT', 'CONTAINS', 'THE', 'FUNNIEST', 'BARFIGHT', 'EVER', 'IN', 'THE', 'HISTORY', 'THE', 'UNIVERSE', 'one', 'most', 'surprising', 'plot', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'see', 'coming', 'hat', 'cry', 'time', 'watch', 'it.It', 'also', 'profoundly', 'show', 'various', 'conflicts', 'ripped', 'fabric', 'American', 'society', '60', 'trashing', 'America', 'itself.Just', 'get']",N/A
