Smith,"[0, 2]","We are expected to believe that the two 18-year-old hotties who lead this film live willingly in this fantasy trailer park somewhere in New Mexico, often lolling in a hot tub where they hold deep conversations. No one appears ever to do anything to earn any money except one works as a cashier in a convenience store where everyone buys things often. There's a silly teenage love story here, replete with a long-term fatal illness involved. If there ever was a place like Dreamland, I'd want to live there and never leave, too. Of course, one of the teenage goddesses is portrayed as a literary genius while her alcoholic love-sick dad can't manage to leave the couch as he moons over his dead wife. I enjoyed the soundtrack, which has a nice tune by Mazzy Star.

Are they people with hopes, ambitions and talents? Are they people like you and me? Maybe yes, maybe no. 'Dreamland' released in '05 deals with just such a quaint, out-of-the-way spot where a small group of individuals dwell away from the maddening crowd in an attempt to sort out the mysteries of life and the possible opportunities that await outside their cloistered community.I enjoyed this movie. `Dreamland' contains an attractive cast of characters, a strong storyline with some quirky situations, beautiful desert scenery and an enjoyable Indie soundtrack.

1025542,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000JBWWQA,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","This is an odd sort of film - simplistic yet profound, sad yet somehow uplifting.  There's a slight edge of surreality to the whole story, but the characters couldn't be more human.  Basically, Dreamland left me feeling a bit odd and slightly out of sorts, but in a good way.  It's as if I expected some kind of enlightenment to break through the clouds in the final moments, and the fact that this didn't happen strikes me as somehow profound.You might recognize the lead actress from the film The Woods, but I've been a fan of Agnes Bruckner ever since I saw her in Rick (another indie film that deserves much more attention than it has received).  It's true that I have a thing for redheads, but this young lady can act, and she has the kind of magical persona that only the greatest actresses are born with.  Watching her in Dreamland, I saw some real similarities with Angelina Jolie in her facial expressions and the sheer power of her presence.  It's an all-too-rare treat to see a great actress at work, and I can only hope that Agnes Bruckner gets the kinds of roles she deserves in the years ahead - she's really something special.  Not to be outdone, however, is Kelli Garner, who turns in an impassioned, subtly exquisite performance as Calista, an ethereal beauty who dreams of becoming Miss America even as she lives with the knowledge and fear of being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.Dreamland, it turns out, is a trailer park out in the middle of the desert.  The small number of inhabitants make up a surprisingly strong community, but the deepest bond is between Audrey (Bruckner) and Calista (Garner).  It's a really confusing time for Audrey, who has just graduated from high school.  Not only does she have her best friend to worry about, she also has to help take care of her father.  Henry (played brilliantly by John Corbett) has never gotten over his wife's death.  Not only does he spend most of his time drinking, he has not been able to leave the trailer park in over two years.  He's emotionally and psychologically unable to take even a few steps outside Dreamland.  Audrey is a smart girl who secretly wants to go to college, but she puts her own dreams aside, believing that her father and Calista need her to stay.Audrey really begins to unravel, though, following the arrival of new neighbors - specifically, Mookie (Justin Long).  True friend that she is, she sets Mookie up with Calista, then finds herself tormented by her own love for the guy.  Obviously, Audrey's friendship with Calista will be tested by this unfortunate love triangle, setting in motion a series of events that ultimately change the lives of all the main characters.As an aside, I have to ask why so many of today's young actors (e.g., Justin Long) look like junior versions of David Schwimmer.  Isn't one David Schwimmer more than enough for all of us?  And Mookie?  Unless your character plays centerfield for the New York Mets, why would you call him Mookie?  Obviously, I'm no Justin Long fan, but Dreamland really isn't about him, anyway.  It's about friendship, love, sacrifice, hopes and dreams, and all of the other things that make us human - and it's truly a wonderful little story.  Hollywood doesn't make nearly enough films like this.",5,There's a fine line between losing it and getting it,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,3258,"['odd', 'sort', 'film', 'simplistic', 'yet', 'profound', 'sad', 'yet', 'somehow', 'uplifting', 'slight', 'edge', 'surreality', 'whole', 'story', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'human', 'Basically', 'Dreamland', 'left', 'feeling', 'bit', 'odd', 'slightly', 'sorts', 'good', 'way', 'expected', 'kind', 'enlightenment', 'break', 'clouds', 'final', 'moments', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'strikes', 'somehow', 'profound.You', 'might', 'recognize', 'lead', 'actress', 'film', 'Woods', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'ever', 'saw', 'Rick', 'indie', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'received', 'true', 'have', 'thing', 'redheads', 'young', 'lady', 'can', 'act', 'kind', 'magical', 'persona', 'only', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'are', 'born', 'Watching', 'Dreamland', 'saw', 'real', 'similarities', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'facial', 'expressions', 'sheer', 'power', 'presence', 'all-too-rare', 'treat', 'see', 'great', 'actress', 'work', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'kinds', 'roles', 'years', 'ahead', 'really', 'something', 'special', 'Not', 'be', 'outdone', 'however', 'Kelli', 'Garner', 'who', 'impassioned', 'subtly', 'exquisite', 'performance', 'Calista', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'who', 'becoming', 'Miss', 'America', 'even', 'knowledge', 'fear', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'multiple', 'sclerosis.Dreamland', 'out', 'trailer', 'park', 'middle', 'desert', 'small', 'number', 'inhabitants', 'make', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'community', 'deepest', 'bond', 'Audrey', 'Bruckner', 'Calista', 'Garner', 'really', 'confusing', 'time', 'Audrey', 'who', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'best', 'friend', 'worry', 'about', 'also', 'help', 'take', 'care', 'father', 'Henry', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'John', 'Corbett', 'never', 'gotten', 'over', 'wife', 'death', 'Not', 'only', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'drinking', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'leave', 'trailer', 'park', 'two', 'years', 'emotionally', 'psychologically', 'unable', 'take', 'even', 'few', 'steps', 'Dreamland', 'Audrey', 'smart', 'girl', 'who', 'secretly', 'go', 'college', 'own', 'dreams', 'aside', 'believing', 'father', 'Calista', 'need', 'stay.Audrey', 'really', 'unravel', 'following', 'arrival', 'new', 'neighbors', 'specifically', 'Mookie', 'Justin', 'Long', 'True', 'friend', 'Mookie', 'up', 'Calista', 'then', 'tormented', 'own', 'love', 'guy', 'Obviously', 'Audrey', 'friendship', 'Calista', 'will', 'be', 'tested', 'unfortunate', 'love', 'triangle', 'setting', 'motion', 'series', 'events', 'ultimately', 'change', 'lives', 'main', 'characters.As', 'aside', 'have', 'ask', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'today', 'young', 'actors', 'e.g.', 'Justin', 'Long', 'look', 'junior', 'versions', 'David', 'Schwimmer', ""n't"", 'one', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'more', 'enough', 'Mookie', 'character', 'plays', 'centerfield', 'New', 'York', 'Mets', 'why', 'would', 'call', 'Mookie', 'Obviously', ""'m"", 'Justin', 'Long', 'fan', 'Dreamland', 'really', ""n't"", 'anyway', 'friendship', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'other', 'things', 'make', 'human', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'little', 'story', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'make', 'nearly', 'enough', 'films']",Dreamland
1025543,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000JBWWQA,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 8]","There are two things that work well in first-time director Jason Matzner's leisurely paced 2006 indie drama. The first are the arresting visuals of the sun-parched New Mexico desert landscape courtesy of the rich, mirage-like cinematography of Jonathan Sela. The second is the touching performance of Agnes Bruckner as eighteen-year old Audrey, the emotional focus of this rather idiosyncratic coming-of-age story. Looking and acting a bit like Toni Collette's prettier baby sister, Bruckner lends refreshing resonance to a role that could have been left as another put-upon teen coming to terms with her life. Written by Tom Willett, the story takes place in the aptly named Dreamland, an isolated trailer park where a group of people are living just outside of the mainstream.What we discover in Dreamland is a community of needy misfits with Audrey the common thread who nobly helps them carry on with their lives. She lives with her beer-swilling, agoraphobic father, who stays in the trailer park like a recluse unable to get past his wife's death two years prior. She also takes care of her best friend, the self-dubbed Calista, a beauty queen wannabe gradually deteriorating from multiple sclerosis. All the while, Audrey works at the local mini-mart with her beatnik co-worker Abraham with whom she experiments carnally on occasion. When a new family moves into the park, Audrey and Calista are both attracted to Mookie, the basketball-obsessed son of a minor-league rock singer just about to marry her pedal steel guitar-playing boyfriend. The inevitable complications occur and lead to a tragic event that forces all the co-dependency issues to come to the surface.The movie has a loping though occasionally inviting tone until the contrived accident at which point Willett seems to shift gears into standard melodrama as if there is a loss of faith in the story. Character transformations occur more as plot conveniences leaving the resolution feeling rather hollow. Beyond Bruckner, the cast is solid even though the characters seem only half-baked. Using his innate likeability from playing decent guys on ""Northern Exposure"" and ""Sex in the City"", John Corbett does what he can with the impossible role of the father. Kelli Garner effectively manages to combine effervescence and fragility as Calista. Even though he looks too short to be convincing as a basketball scholarship candidate, Justin Long provides affecting moments as Mookie when he is not contriving basketball analogies to explain his feelings. The usually more intriguing Gina Gershon is barely onscreen as his mother. Other than previews of current theatrical releases and new DVDs, there are no extras to be found on the 2006 DVD.",3,Dreams in the Desert...and a Lot of Co-Dependency,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,2712,"['are', 'two', 'things', 'work', 'well', 'first-time', 'director', 'Jason', 'Matzner', 'leisurely', 'paced', '2006', 'indie', 'drama', 'first', 'are', 'arresting', 'visuals', 'sun-parched', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'landscape', 'courtesy', 'rich', 'mirage-like', 'cinematography', 'Jonathan', 'Sela', 'second', 'touching', 'performance', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'eighteen-year', 'old', 'Audrey', 'emotional', 'focus', 'rather', 'idiosyncratic', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'Looking', 'acting', 'bit', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'prettier', 'baby', 'sister', 'Bruckner', 'refreshing', 'resonance', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'put-upon', 'teen', 'coming', 'terms', 'life', 'Written', 'Tom', 'Willett', 'story', 'place', 'aptly', 'named', 'Dreamland', 'isolated', 'trailer', 'park', 'where', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'living', 'just', 'mainstream.What', 'discover', 'Dreamland', 'community', 'needy', 'misfits', 'Audrey', 'common', 'thread', 'who', 'nobly', 'carry', 'lives', 'beer-swilling', 'agoraphobic', 'father', 'who', 'trailer', 'park', 'recluse', 'unable', 'get', 'wife', 'death', 'two', 'years', 'prior', 'also', 'care', 'best', 'friend', 'self-dubbed', 'Calista', 'beauty', 'queen', 'wannabe', 'gradually', 'deteriorating', 'multiple', 'sclerosis', 'while', 'Audrey', 'local', 'mini-mart', 'beatnik', 'co-worker', 'Abraham', 'whom', 'carnally', 'occasion', 'When', 'new', 'family', 'park', 'Audrey', 'Calista', 'are', 'attracted', 'Mookie', 'basketball-obsessed', 'son', 'minor-league', 'rock', 'singer', 'just', 'marry', 'pedal', 'steel', 'guitar-playing', 'boyfriend', 'inevitable', 'complications', 'occur', 'lead', 'tragic', 'event', 'co-dependency', 'issues', 'come', 'surface.The', 'movie', 'loping', 'occasionally', 'inviting', 'tone', 'contrived', 'accident', 'point', 'Willett', 'shift', 'gears', 'standard', 'melodrama', 'loss', 'faith', 'story', 'Character', 'transformations', 'occur', 'more', 'plot', 'conveniences', 'leaving', 'resolution', 'feeling', 'rather', 'hollow', 'Beyond', 'Bruckner', 'cast', 'solid', 'even', 'characters', 'seem', 'only', 'half-baked', 'Using', 'innate', 'likeability', 'playing', 'decent', 'guys', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Sex', 'City', 'John', 'Corbett', 'what', 'can', 'impossible', 'role', 'father', 'Kelli', 'Garner', 'effectively', 'combine', 'effervescence', 'fragility', 'Calista', 'Even', 'too', 'short', 'be', 'convincing', 'basketball', 'scholarship', 'candidate', 'Justin', 'Long', 'affecting', 'moments', 'Mookie', 'when', 'not', 'contriving', 'basketball', 'analogies', 'explain', 'feelings', 'usually', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'barely', 'onscreen', 'mother', 'Other', 'previews', 'current', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'new', 'DVDs', 'are', 'extras', 'be', 'found', '2006', 'DVD']",Dreamland

Written by Tom Willett and directed with great sensitivity to both style and message by Jason Matzner, the film boasts a truly remarkable cast in every role and the ensemble acting is some of the finest in this year's lineup.""Dreamland"" is the name of a very small trailer park in New Mexico, out in the sticks, yes, but surrounded by the magnificence of majestic clouds in crystalline blue skies and a land free of industrial detritus - except for the powerlines that play such an important role in the story.  In a sad trailer house live Audrey (Agnes Bruckner), a poet who has given up chances for college to remain with her father Henry (John Corbett), a man decimated by the death of his wife to the point that he is unable to leave the trailer even to buy the beer and cigarettes that sustain his life. Audrey also is caring for her closest friend Calista (Kelli Garner), a beautiful girl who dreams of becoming Miss America but knows her life is to be shortened by the fact that she suffers from Multiple Sclerosis.  Audrey writes her poetry but her life is consumed by being the caretaker for Henry and Calista.Into the trailer park moves a new 'family' - hunky young Mookie (Justin Long) and his mother ex-singer/performer Mary (Gina Gershon) and her live-in boyfriend Herb (Chris Mulkey).  Audrey and Calista watch them unpack and while both girls find Mookie attractive, Audrey talks Calista into dating him.  Audrey's only male contact is her 'sex-buddy', tacky and gawky Abraham (Brian Klugman) who works at the local convenience store with Audrey.  Mookie and Calista begin an affair while Audrey looks on longingly, and when Calista lets Mookie know she has MS the relationship is strained: Mookie also is leaving for the university soon.Audrey confesses her feelings for Mookie and Calista flees on a motorcycle to chase the now departed Mookie.  She is in an accident and is hospitalized and since she has broken her relationship with her caretaker Audrey, Henry manages to draw enough courage to leave his trailer to sit at Calista's hospital bedside - along with visits from Mookie.  Calista's accident makes her even more aware of her fractured future and she releases her feelings for Mookie, reconnects with Audrey, and Audrey's father discovers her many letters of acceptance to college she has hidden to prevent abandoning her role as caretaker and convinces Audrey to flow with her dreams instead of being imprisoned in Dreamland.  And the manner in which each of the characters in the film resolves the changes now facing them is the tender ending of the story.DREAMLAND is created by a very strong cast of fine actors who dwell solidly within their characters' psyches, making this somewhat surreal story very real indeed.  The setting is extraordinary in its ordinariness and the camerawork by Jonathan Sela  is impeccable.  This is a strong story about coming of age, about quality of love, and about being human.  It is a treasure.

1025545,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000JBWWQA,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","""Dreamland"" is one of those movies that come out every year and stay completely below the radar and maintain only the smallest of audiences. It was one of those movies I saw the trailer for and just thought ""I have to see that movie."" It, in the end, falls short in many areas and isn't a masterpiece; But it's got some powerhouse performances and a great look and mood to it. Agnes Brucker, a talented actress who appeared in ""The Woods,"" plays Audrey, an aspiring poet, who lives in a trailer park deep in New Mexico called Dreamland. Audrey lives with her dad Henry (John Corbett); a man who lives in an alcohol induced haze and likes to reminisce about his long-dead wife. Audrey's best friend is Calista (Kelli Garner, 'Thumbsucker'), a girl recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis who one day dreams of winning Miss America. Their lives are long and empty. Audrey works at a convenience store and has sex with her co-worker, then she goes home and writes poetry, or hangs out with Calista. Then a new family moves in; Mom, Mary (Gina Gershon), boyfriend Herb (Chris Mulkey), and son Mookie (Justin Long), who the girls instantly take a liking too. When Calista and Mookie start dating, Audrey (whose life is all about supporting the people around her) finds jealousy consuming her. Eventually, Mookie and Audrey find themselves falling for each other and so on...The movie comes very close to becoming a masterpiece. It's got all the elements; great acting, great cinematography, great art direction, and great dialogue. It's the script (by Tom Willett) that just stops it from entering the realm of masterpiece. The film tends to drag in some spots, but is overall entertaining. I have to give Willett credit for writing a movie about people who live in a trailer park and not turning them into stereotypes. Nobody's fat, nobody's pregnant, nobody's missing any teeth, and even the alcoholic dad isn't abusive in any way. Corbett (who recently took a break from acting to pursue a career in country music) shows that he's got real acting chops that have yet to be fully seen with films like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and stints on the series ""Sex & the City."" The biggest surprise to me was Justin Long, an actor who normally dapples in comedies (Dodgeball, Accepted, etc.). The only dramatic role I've seen him in was in a horror movie called ""Jeepers Creepers"" but he gives a good, solid performance in ""Dreamland."" Bruckner and Garner are two actresses that have careers in front of them. They're not beautiful, but they both can act and even some dialogue that doesn't quite work sounds good coming from them. ""Dreamland"" is, overall, a minor masterpiece that is still a wonder of a debut film (the director, Jason Matzner, has the potential to be a very good filmmaker) and I recommend you see it if you enjoyed movies ranging from ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" to ""Thirteen.""GRADE: B",4,Almost a Masterpiece,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2904,"['Dreamland', 'one', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'stay', 'completely', 'radar', 'maintain', 'only', 'smallest', 'audiences', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'saw', 'trailer', 'just', 'thought', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'end', 'short', 'many', 'areas', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'got', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'great', 'look', 'mood', 'Agnes', 'Brucker', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'appeared', 'Woods', 'Audrey', 'aspiring', 'poet', 'who', 'trailer', 'park', 'deep', 'New', 'Mexico', 'called', 'Dreamland', 'Audrey', 'dad', 'Henry', 'John', 'Corbett', 'man', 'who', 'alcohol', 'induced', 'haze', 'likes', 'reminisce', 'long-dead', 'wife', 'Audrey', 'best', 'friend', 'Calista', 'Kelli', 'Garner', ""'Thumbsucker"", 'girl', 'recently', 'diagnosed', 'multiple', 'sclerosis', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'dreams', 'winning', 'Miss', 'America', 'lives', 'are', 'long', 'empty', 'Audrey', 'convenience', 'store', 'sex', 'co-worker', 'then', 'home', 'poetry', 'hangs', 'out', 'Calista', 'Then', 'new', 'family', 'moves', 'Mom', 'Mary', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'boyfriend', 'Herb', 'Chris', 'Mulkey', 'son', 'Mookie', 'Justin', 'Long', 'who', 'girls', 'instantly', 'take', 'liking', 'too', 'When', 'Calista', 'Mookie', 'start', 'dating', 'Audrey', 'life', 'supporting', 'people', 'jealousy', 'consuming', 'Eventually', 'Mookie', 'Audrey', 'find', 'falling', 'other', 'so', 'movie', 'very', 'close', 'becoming', 'masterpiece', 'got', 'elements', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'cinematography', 'great', 'art', 'direction', 'great', 'dialogue', 'script', 'Tom', 'Willett', 'just', 'entering', 'realm', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'drag', 'spots', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'have', 'give', 'Willett', 'credit', 'writing', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'trailer', 'park', 'not', 'turning', 'stereotypes', 'Nobody', 'fat', 'nobody', 'pregnant', 'nobody', 'missing', 'teeth', 'even', 'alcoholic', 'dad', ""n't"", 'abusive', 'way', 'Corbett', 'who', 'recently', 'took', 'break', 'acting', 'pursue', 'career', 'country', 'music', 'got', 'real', 'acting', 'chops', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'fully', 'seen', 'films', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'stints', 'series', 'Sex', 'City', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'Justin', 'Long', 'actor', 'who', 'normally', 'comedies', 'Dodgeball', 'Accepted', 'etc.', 'only', 'dramatic', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'horror', 'movie', 'called', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'good', 'solid', 'performance', 'Dreamland', 'Bruckner', 'Garner', 'are', 'two', 'actresses', 'have', 'careers', 'front', ""'re"", 'not', 'beautiful', 'can', 'act', 'even', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'sounds', 'good', 'coming', 'Dreamland', 'overall', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'wonder', 'debut', 'film', 'director', 'Jason', 'Matzner', 'potential', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'recommend', 'see', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'ranging', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'Thirteen', 'GRADE', 'B']",Dreamland
1025546,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,B000JBWWQA,LARRY,"[1, 2]","*Dreamland* tries to paint a sterotypical life at an isolated trailer park, without the Jerry Springer drama.  Life and time goes by slowly, with almost nothing to do.Audrey, a poetress, has just graduated from high school.  She stashes acceptance letters from colleges in a hat box.  The reason for this is because she feels obligated to care for her widowed father, who does nothing but drink and smoke, and her best friend, Calista, who is afflicted with MS and dreams of being Miss America.A new untraditional family moves in next door, which includes a young guy whom Audrey and Calista deems hot.  (To me, eww!)  Audrey, thinking the best for Calista, sets up her best friend with the new guy, Mookie.  However, upon their first date, Audrey seems to regret doing this.Of course, things go wrong when Audrey and Mookie admit their feelings to each other.  Worse, Calista finds out about it.  Angry, Calista takes off in search for Mookie who has just left for college.  However, things don't go the way they're supposed to.So, *Dreamland* is about dreams put to the test, whether that be love, a career or new changes.  Do you drop everything around you and pursue your dreams or do you put your dreams on hold and take care of everything around you?  That is the question.Overall, I did enjoy this movie.  However, I found it a bit slow and a bit depressing for me.",3,a somewhat morose film of a trailer park life,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,1372,"['*Dreamland*', 'tries', 'paint', 'sterotypical', 'life', 'isolated', 'trailer', 'park', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'drama', 'Life', 'time', 'slowly', 'almost', 'nothing', 'do.Audrey', 'poetress', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'acceptance', 'letters', 'colleges', 'hat', 'box', 'reason', 'obligated', 'care', 'widowed', 'father', 'who', 'nothing', 'drink', 'smoke', 'best', 'friend', 'Calista', 'who', 'afflicted', 'MS', 'dreams', 'being', 'Miss', 'America.A', 'new', 'untraditional', 'family', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'young', 'guy', 'whom', 'Audrey', 'Calista', 'hot', 'eww', 'Audrey', 'thinking', 'best', 'Calista', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'new', 'guy', 'Mookie', 'However', 'first', 'date', 'Audrey', 'regret', 'doing', 'this.Of', 'course', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'Audrey', 'Mookie', 'admit', 'feelings', 'other', 'Worse', 'Calista', 'out', 'Angry', 'Calista', 'off', 'search', 'Mookie', 'who', 'just', 'left', 'college', 'However', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'to.So', '*Dreamland*', 'dreams', 'put', 'test', 'be', 'love', 'career', 'new', 'changes', 'Do', 'drop', 'everything', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'do', 'put', 'dreams', 'hold', 'take', 'care', 'everything', 'question.Overall', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'However', 'found', 'bit', 'slow', 'bit', 'depressing']",Dreamland

1025549,A26EAPS9DZM2JB,B000JBWWQA,Quick Reviews,"[0, 0]","I recently came across this movie and was really impresseed. The main theme is about a young woman, Audrey, who is a very dutiful friend and daughter. Audrey dreams of leaving the Dreamland cacoon and experiencing life. Instead of acting on her college and life's ambitions, she puts herself at the disposal of others (her devestated, widowed father and her chronically ill best friend).Pragmatically speaking, she simply has to nudge her dad out of his comfort zone. Teach him how to live again by dragging him out of the trailer and going places - initially with her. Like many challenges in personal relationships, this is easier said than done.In the end the father helps himself in order to help his daughter. When he finds her letters of acceptance to various colleges she has hidden from him, he realizes he MUST step-up, and transform from being Audrey's dependent to being her dad.
