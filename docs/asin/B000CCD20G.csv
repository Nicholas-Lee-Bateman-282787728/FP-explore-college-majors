956654,A3SW0B5IBY53AJ,B000CCD20G,Brian,"[0, 0]",When I was little I had a VHS copy of this.  I remember I used to watch it all the time.  I was a great cartoon to watch as a kid.  For years since then I always had it in my mind that I watched this as a kid but I couldn't remember the name of it.  I looked it up and I am glad to see it's on DVD.  I recommend this for any child.,4,A blast from my childhood!,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,331,"['When', 'was', 'little', 'had', 'VHS', 'copy', 'remember', 'used', 'watch', 'time', 'was', 'great', 'cartoon', 'watch', 'kid', 'years', 'then', 'always', 'had', 'mind', 'watched', 'kid', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'looked', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'DVD', 'recommend', 'child']",Adventures of Scamper the Penguin

It has lots of excitement and laughter.

956660,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000CCD20G,Michael Butts,"[8, 8]","The animation in this Japanese cartoon is certainly not up to the standards of today's big-budget toonies, but it's a cute little film that smaller kids should find interesting and adults can tolerate.  Scamper is a penguin chick with a penchant for wandering away from the nest.  Facing attacks from seagulls and sea lions, Scamper nevertheless wanders off and meets a huskie and his human owner, a scientist.  Another venture is not as friendly though as Scamper and his little pal Snowflake are whisked away by hunters who plan to sell them to the zoo.  They meet Louie, a Macaroni penguin (?) who tries to help them escape.Scamper teaches the value of learning and family and is harmless enough for the young set, although there is a little disturbing violence with the penguin hunters.  All in all, a fun movie for the family to watch together.",4,KIDDIE FUN,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,849,"['animation', 'Japanese', 'cartoon', 'certainly', 'not', 'standards', 'today', 'big-budget', 'toonies', 'cute', 'little', 'film', 'smaller', 'kids', 'should', 'find', 'interesting', 'adults', 'can', 'tolerate', 'Scamper', 'penguin', 'chick', 'penchant', 'wandering', 'away', 'nest', 'Facing', 'attacks', 'seagulls', 'sea', 'lions', 'Scamper', 'nevertheless', 'wanders', 'huskie', 'human', 'owner', 'scientist', 'venture', 'not', 'friendly', 'Scamper', 'little', 'pal', 'Snowflake', 'are', 'whisked', 'away', 'hunters', 'who', 'plan', 'sell', 'zoo', 'meet', 'Louie', 'Macaroni', 'penguin', 'who', 'help', 'escape.Scamper', 'value', 'learning', 'family', 'harmless', 'enough', 'young', 'set', 'little', 'disturbing', 'violence', 'penguin', 'hunters', 'fun', 'movie', 'family', 'watch', 'together']",Adventures of Scamper the Penguin

You might want to prepare your students/children about poachers though as there is a scene where hunters shoot at the older penguins in order to get away with Scamper.,5,Very Cute!,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,261,"['preschoolers', 'love', 'movie', 'play', 'doing', 'mini', 'unit', 'study', 'penguins', 'might', 'want', 'prepare', 'students/children', 'poachers', 'scene', 'where', 'hunters', 'shoot', 'older', 'penguins', 'order', 'get', 'away', 'Scamper']",Adventures of Scamper the Penguin
