Williams,"[1, 1]","The Mask: In Edge City, nice guy Stanley Ipkiss, Jim Carrey, gets sssmokin' when he wears the mask of Loki which releases the id that is normally suppressed. Cameron Diaz is in this film and Ben Stein plays Dr. Neuman who has coincidentally written a metaphorical book titled The Masks We Wear. I think Jim Carrey is funny.Son of the Mask:  Beyond Edge City is Fringe City. Ben Stein is the only recurring actor in the sequel. It is like a nonanimated cartoon. Jamie Kennedy and Traylor Howard ,of Monk, are a couple who have a son that was conceived while he was wearing the mask. Alan Cummings is Loki who is searching for his mask. This movie is more enjoyable if you can latch onto the sweetness of the family and overlook a few cinematic details.",4,Looney,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,751,"['Mask', 'Edge', 'City', 'nice', 'guy', 'Stanley', 'Ipkiss', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'sssmokin', 'when', 'mask', 'Loki', 'id', 'normally', 'suppressed', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'film', 'Ben', 'Stein', 'Dr.', 'Neuman', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'written', 'metaphorical', 'book', 'titled', 'Masks', 'Wear', 'think', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'funny.Son', 'Mask', 'Beyond', 'Edge', 'City', 'Fringe', 'City', 'Ben', 'Stein', 'only', 'recurring', 'actor', 'sequel', 'nonanimated', 'cartoon', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'Traylor', 'Howard', 'Monk', 'are', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'son', 'was', 'conceived', 'was', 'wearing', 'mask', 'Alan', 'Cummings', 'Loki', 'who', 'searching', 'mask', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'latch', 'sweetness', 'family', 'overlook', 'few', 'cinematic', 'details']",The Mask / Son of the Mask

Stanley, played by Carrey, finds a magical mask that turns him into a character unlike himself. This includes his dog.  The second movie 'Son of the Mask' is surprisingly fun to watch. This time Loki, some ancient god of mischief, comes in search of his Mask and that's when the fun begins.",4,Great fun and laughs,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,404,"['like', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'then', 'movie', 'action', 'filled', 'fun', 'toe', 'tapping', 'music', 'Stanley', 'played', 'Carrey', 'magical', 'mask', 'character', 'dog', 'second', 'movie', ""'Son"", 'Mask', 'surprisingly', 'fun', 'watch', 'time', 'Loki', 'ancient', 'god', 'mischief', 'search', 'Mask', 'when', 'fun']",The Mask / Son of the Mask
