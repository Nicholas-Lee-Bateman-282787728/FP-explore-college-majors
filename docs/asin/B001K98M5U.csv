Uncut and unedited the way it's supposed to be.For this stretch of episodes, it's nonstop action. We get the conclusion of the Baratie Arc and jump straight into the Arlong Arc. The two main villains appearing in these episodes are Don Krieg and Arlong. Sanji officially join the crew, and we get to look at Nami's backstory. One Piece really hits it's stride with these episodes, and there's nary a fluff episode in sight.Special mention should go for episodes 35 and 36, Nami's backstory. I was concerned that the dub would lose the emotional weight of the story, but I was pleasantly surprised when the english VA for Nami managed to bring the right emotional sting to the role.And don't foget to watch the commentary, you're paying for it, after all.",5,"If you can only own one long runner, make it this one",1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,875,"['Part', 'three', 'Funimation', 'much', 'beloved', 'redub', 'One', 'Piece', 'not', 'crappy', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'version', 'assure', 'Uncut', 'unedited', 'way', 'supposed', 'be.For', 'stretch', 'episodes', 'nonstop', 'action', 'get', 'conclusion', 'Baratie', 'Arc', 'jump', 'straight', 'Arlong', 'Arc', 'two', 'main', 'villains', 'appearing', 'episodes', 'are', 'Don', 'Krieg', 'Arlong', 'Sanji', 'officially', 'crew', 'get', 'look', 'Nami', 'backstory', 'One', 'Piece', 'really', 'stride', 'episodes', 'nary', 'fluff', 'episode', 'sight.Special', 'mention', 'should', 'go', 'episodes', '35', '36', 'Nami', 'backstory', 'was', 'concerned', 'dub', 'would', 'lose', 'emotional', 'weight', 'story', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'english', 'VA', 'Nami', 'managed', 'bring', 'right', 'emotional', 'sting', 'role.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'foget', 'watch', 'commentary', ""'re"", 'paying']","One Piece: Season 1, Third Voyage"

It has comedy, drama, action, adventure, etc. It's an endearing and quite popular anime title but that's because there's something in it that everyone can enjoy. Only complaint?
