Cross ""D_Cross""","[0, 2]","When I saw my first Swanberg film, I thought it was a brilliant parody of this subculture of folks I like to call indie kids - even though they're chronologically not kids at all. You will find them in great abundance in the Silverlake area of Los Angeles, for example. They try to be super-ironic and arty.As a slice of life treatise on this group of people who are totally emotionally detached, intellectually stunted, and socially and politically disengaged - his movies work great. However, it has dawned on me that this is not the director's intent at all. This isn't a polemic on a generation of young adults who have been given everything and waste it in the most pathetic, contrarian fashion - this guy actually thinks hes making serious films about real people.This realization has thus turned my view of his work on its head. The only thing more torturous than watching this movie would be sitting next to these losers in some faux-bohemian coffeehouse.",1,...you'll just be looking for the exit,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,963,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'Swanberg', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'parody', 'subculture', 'folks', 'like', 'call', 'indie', 'kids', 'even', ""'re"", 'chronologically', 'not', 'kids', 'will', 'find', 'great', 'abundance', 'Silverlake', 'area', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'example', 'try', 'be', 'super-ironic', 'slice', 'life', 'treatise', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'totally', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'intellectually', 'stunted', 'socially', 'politically', 'disengaged', 'movies', 'work', 'great', 'However', 'dawned', 'not', 'director', 'intent', ""n't"", 'polemic', 'generation', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'everything', 'waste', 'most', 'pathetic', 'contrarian', 'fashion', 'guy', 'actually', 'hes', 'making', 'serious', 'films', 'real', 'people.This', 'realization', 'thus', 'turned', 'view', 'work', 'head', 'only', 'thing', 'more', 'torturous', 'watching', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'sitting', 'next', 'losers', 'faux-bohemian', 'coffeehouse']",Hannah Takes the Stairs

The middle lover didn't get a nude scene.  The nude scenes are the highlight (the only highlight) of this movie.  The cinematography is good so a star for that and another for the leading lady's charms.  You have to wonder if they made up the script as they went along.  It is worse than mundane.  I cannot believe anyone talking like these people do.  I cannot believe these people work at a television show. There are scenes where she makes faces at a bus stop.  I don't know why she dumped the shower guy.  But the bathtub guy playing a horn along with nude Hannah playing her horn was worth the $1.17 I paid for a used copy.  But don't waste your life watching the middle of this.

1134928,A3MYY88NLEJ8Y3,B00125WAVY,Diane Moore,"[13, 21]","To start off, I love independent film. I love low-budget films.  After all,Clerks (Collector's Series)was a low budget film. But, that movie was entertaining and funny. This movie seemed to have no redeeming value.Hannah is a twenty-something intern at a production company. She starts off with one boyfriend, and quickly gets rid of him, because she likes someone else that she is working with. He starts to get a little stale as well, so she replaces him with the other guy that they are working with.I would find it more interesting if there was a script intact. I could deal with ad-libbing if it were amusing or enjoyable, (not to say that this was ad-libbed, but it seems as though it was) but most of the time, you had to listen carefully, because there was a lot of mumbling, and to be honest, the characters weren't that compelling. They also seemed as if they could learn some social skills as well.And, of course, there is Hannah. She seems to be floating through life, not a care in the world, except for who she is going to sleep with next. She wasn't intelligent like the men at work claimed. She was so self absorbed, so annoying, and it was really hard to listen to her voice, quite honestly. I have read many books and seen movies where the characters are not good people or I don't empathize with them, but at least in those situations, the characters were intriguing! The conversations were so awkward, with so many pregnant pauses, and everyone interrupting each other. It was like not being able to look away from a car crash.My boyfriend walked out of the room halfway through, but I decided to stick it out, just in case it got better. I hardly ever write really negative reviews like this, unless something is really terrible.",1,Hannah ruins the movie...,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,1750,"['start', 'off', 'love', 'independent', 'film', 'love', 'low-budget', 'films', 'Clerks', 'Collector', 'Series', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'redeeming', 'value.Hannah', 'twenty-something', 'intern', 'production', 'company', 'one', 'boyfriend', 'quickly', 'rid', 'someone', 'else', 'working', 'get', 'little', 'stale', 'well', 'other', 'guy', 'are', 'working', 'with.I', 'would', 'find', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'script', 'intact', 'could', 'deal', 'ad-libbing', 'were', 'amusing', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'ad-libbed', 'was', 'most', 'time', 'had', 'listen', 'carefully', 'was', 'lot', 'mumbling', 'be', 'honest', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'also', 'seemed', 'could', 'learn', 'social', 'skills', 'well.And', 'course', 'Hannah', 'be', 'floating', 'life', 'not', 'care', 'world', 'who', 'going', 'sleep', 'next', 'was', ""n't"", 'intelligent', 'men', 'work', 'claimed', 'was', 'so', 'self', 'absorbed', 'annoying', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'listen', 'voice', 'quite', 'honestly', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'seen', 'movies', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'empathize', 'least', 'situations', 'characters', 'were', 'intriguing', 'conversations', 'were', 'so', 'awkward', 'so', 'many', 'pregnant', 'pauses', 'everyone', 'interrupting', 'other', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'look', 'away', 'car', 'crash.My', 'boyfriend', 'walked', 'room', 'halfway', 'decided', 'stick', 'out', 'just', 'case', 'got', 'better', 'hardly', 'ever', 'write', 'really', 'negative', 'reviews', 'something', 'really', 'terrible']",Hannah Takes the Stairs
1134929,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B00125WAVY,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","One of the main conversations at the end of the movie has Hannah and her soon-to-be boyfriend using the word &#34;like&#34; SOOOO many times, that I was laughing! It was supposed to be a scene of self-reflection for both and becomes inane.Oh, was this tedious! It just a slice-of-life, low budget film that looks to have been made in someone's basement. Everyone is a slacker at some &#34;job&#34; in a very ill-defined, Chicago-area, cinder-block closet. It appears to be some video production company, but the lack of any work or any overheard conversations, on and off of phones, really doesn't make it clear. The characters are pathetic and annoying - ultimately unrealistic and wooden. The actors and actresses seem to be relying on some direction for the story. The lack of depth simply makes the characters unsympathetic and the viewer is left finding zero empathy with any one of them. In most of the movie, I believed that the cast was drunk and simply ad-libbing in their drunken states. Just look at how red their faces and watery the eyes are throughout!Why this movie was picked-up by Weinstein or IFC is beyond me. Maybe they all like looking at Hannah's nude body or the male nudity at the end.Please note that the DVD cover gives the movie &#34;No Rating&#34;, but the nudity itself and the highly adult &#34;relationships&#34; storyline is not for young viewers. This is a twenty-something movie. It uses the word &#34;like&#34; so many times, that I was screaming it to prompt the coming of the word. I'm from Chicago and never heard the word used so much in conversation. It's a sign of bad speech and writing. The sound work is poor, mostly because the director forgot the cardinal rules in sound (such as don't film in places where it will reverberate and sound horrible in the final cut).1 of 5. Just stay away, and don't be suckered into the DVD cover. Hey, Swanberg - Where can I get a job in CHICAGO where I just sit around, do nothing work-related, talk gibberish, hit people with toys, and make out with a girl???",1,"Like, Don't, Like, Bother With This, Like, Movie",1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,2040,"['One', 'main', 'conversations', 'end', 'movie', 'Hannah', 'soon-to-be', 'boyfriend', 'using', 'word', '34', '34', 'SOOOO', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'laughing', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'scene', 'self-reflection', 'inane.Oh', 'was', 'tedious', 'just', 'slice-of-life', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'someone', 'basement', 'Everyone', 'slacker', '34', 'job', '34', 'very', 'ill-defined', 'Chicago-area', 'cinder-block', 'closet', 'be', 'video', 'production', 'company', 'lack', 'work', 'overheard', 'conversations', 'phones', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear', 'characters', 'are', 'pathetic', 'annoying', 'ultimately', 'unrealistic', 'wooden', 'actors', 'actresses', 'seem', 'be', 'relying', 'direction', 'story', 'lack', 'depth', 'simply', 'characters', 'unsympathetic', 'viewer', 'left', 'finding', 'zero', 'empathy', 'one', 'most', 'movie', 'believed', 'cast', 'was', 'drunk', 'simply', 'ad-libbing', 'drunken', 'states', 'Just', 'look', 'how', 'red', 'eyes', 'are', 'Why', 'movie', 'was', 'picked-up', 'Weinstein', 'IFC', 'Maybe', 'looking', 'Hannah', 'nude', 'body', 'male', 'nudity', 'end.Please', 'note', 'DVD', 'cover', 'movie', '34', 'No', 'Rating', '34', 'nudity', 'highly', 'adult', '34', 'relationships', '34', 'storyline', 'not', 'young', 'viewers', 'twenty-something', 'movie', 'word', '34', '34', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'screaming', 'prompt', 'coming', 'word', ""'m"", 'Chicago', 'never', 'heard', 'word', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'conversation', 'sign', 'bad', 'speech', 'writing', 'sound', 'work', 'poor', 'mostly', 'director', 'forgot', 'cardinal', 'rules', 'sound', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'film', 'places', 'where', 'will', 'reverberate', 'sound', 'horrible', 'final', 'cut', '.1', '5', 'Just', 'stay', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'suckered', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Hey', 'Swanberg', 'Where', 'can', 'get', 'job', 'CHICAGO', 'where', 'just', 'sit', 'around', 'do', 'nothing', 'work-related', 'talk', 'gibberish', 'hit', 'people', 'toys', 'make', 'out', 'girl']",Hannah Takes the Stairs
1134930,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00125WAVY,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","**1/2Joe Swanberg`s ""Hannah Takes the Stairs"" is a low-budget art-film done in a quasi-improvisational style.  It centers around a group of self-absorbed twenty-somethings who spend most of their time sitting around discussing life and relationships as if such subjects had never been talked about before.  The result is a sometimes insightful but more often tedious look into the mindset of today's younger generation.Hannah (Greta Gerwig) is a neo-Bohemian playwright with poor instincts when it comes to men, who, upon dumping her ne'er-do-well musician boyfriend, immediately strikes up romances with two fellows at the obviously loosey-goosey TV production company where she works.  The movie strives hard to be as extemporaneous as possible both in its performances and its direction, and while that does yield a few moments of truth and honesty along the way (the break-up scene is almost painfully convincing), too much of the movie is simply vapid and self-indulgent, with a trio of perfectly able-bodied young folk puling and mewling and whining about life to the point where we just don`t care to listen to them anymore.With no real plot or storyline to speak of, watching ""Hannah Takes the Stairs"" is a bit like staring at someone else's random doodlings for an hour-and-a-half and finding no real reason why we should care about them.  And, oh yes, unless I missed it, no actual staircase appears in the movie, with or without Hannah going up or down it.
