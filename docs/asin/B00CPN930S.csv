I have to admit, while the living room was filled with giggles, I just didn't ""get it"".  LOL.  Pocoyo was having a great time sneaking up scaring everyone, including the narrator, and the kids were in fits of giggles themselves over it.  I will say that in our home, we are always sneaking up on each other and scaring each other and it IS a lot of fun so maybe the kids were relating to it.  Overall, it was a good movie.  While the cover and title makes it look Halloween-ish, it's really not.  The only complaint I have is that I wish the alien was a she in ""Scary Noises"".  While that innuendo was hard to catch and most children may not, I don't feel the need for it to be included in a children's movie.",3,Sent the kids into fits of giggles as usual.,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,785,"['family', 'received', 'copy', 'Pocoyo-Boo', 'month', 'NSider', 'review', 'have', 'admit', 'living', 'room', 'was', 'filled', 'giggles', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'LOL', 'Pocoyo', 'was', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'sneaking', 'up', 'scaring', 'everyone', 'including', 'narrator', 'kids', 'were', 'fits', 'giggles', 'will', 'say', 'home', 'are', 'always', 'sneaking', 'up', 'other', 'scaring', 'other', 'lot', 'fun', 'maybe', 'kids', 'were', 'relating', 'Overall', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'cover', 'title', 'look', 'Halloween-ish', 'really', 'not', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'wish', 'alien', 'was', 'Scary', 'Noises', 'innuendo', 'was', 'hard', 'catch', 'most', 'children', 'may', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'be', 'included', 'children', 'movie']",Pocoyo- Boo!

1649923,AOURF2C6EWZNS,B00CPN930S,Jennifer,"[0, 0]","First off, I have to let you know we were given this move for the purpose of doing a review on it.  I've been thinking about what I wanted to say about Pocoyo Boo for a few days now. Unfortunately my son, he is 2,  did not care for this movie at all. I've put it on for him a few different times and each time he lost interest in no time.  I have to say I didn't really care too much for it either though. Now it Pocoyo's defense, we have never watched anything Pocoyo before and just couldn't get into it. I think it's the fact that for the most part the characters don't really do any of the talking, everything is mostly interpreted by the narrator. I  think that is why he lost interest, he is too young to grasp that. I didn't care for the fact that the movie was put out to and made be a Halloween movie when you look at it, but it really isn't. There are 7 episodes (Boo, Scary Noises, Detective Pocoyo, Lost In Space, Poczilla, Monster Mystery and Angry Alien) none of which are about Halloween. The movie runs about 45 minutes, so it is a decent length for a kid's movie. Now don't get me wrong, I don't want to make discourage anyone about Pocoyo. I have friends who's kids just love Pocoyo and I'm sure if your a Pocoyo fan you will like this move, my son just wasn't one of them. Well I hope that helps some of you... enjoy.",2,Not a Halloween movie but would be good for a Pocoyo fan.,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,1336,"['First', 'have', 'let', 'know', 'were', 'given', 'move', 'purpose', 'doing', 'review', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thinking', 'what', 'wanted', 'say', 'Pocoyo', 'Boo', 'few', 'days', 'now', 'Unfortunately', 'son', '2', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'put', 'few', 'different', 'times', 'time', 'lost', 'interest', 'time', 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'Now', 'Pocoyo', 'defense', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'anything', 'Pocoyo', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'think', 'fact', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'talking', 'everything', 'mostly', 'interpreted', 'narrator', 'think', 'why', 'lost', 'interest', 'too', 'young', 'grasp', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'made', 'be', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'when', 'look', 'really', ""n't"", 'are', '7', 'episodes', 'Boo', 'Scary', 'Noises', 'Detective', 'Pocoyo', 'Lost', 'Space', 'Poczilla', 'Monster', 'Mystery', 'Angry', 'Alien', 'none', 'are', 'Halloween', 'movie', '45', 'minutes', 'decent', 'length', 'kid', 'movie', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'discourage', 'anyone', 'Pocoyo', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'kids', 'just', 'love', 'Pocoyo', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Pocoyo', 'fan', 'will', 'like', 'move', 'son', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'Well', 'hope', 'enjoy']",Pocoyo- Boo!
1649924,AQS7029ZUSTUR,B00CPN930S,Keeping It Real,"[1, 5]","This video is truly great for young children with gay parents or children that have other gay couples in their family. It's also great for parents that want to address homosexual relationships at an early age. Our family, however, prefers to establish male/female relationships as the baseline and save the complexities of different sexual preferences for when she's a little older. I grew up with heterosexual relationships as the ""norm"" but that didn't affect my ability to accept gay couples when I was older.In the episode, ""Scary Noises"", the duck (is his name Pato?), who is a ""he"" falls in love with an alien, who is also a ""he"". Complete with throbbing hearts and romantic picnics gazing into each others eyes. I watched it again to make sure it wasn't my assumption that the alien was a ""he"". Indeed, the narrator calls it a ""he"". In another episode, they return to space specifically to find their ""friend"". As viewers, we naturally expect them to be looking for the romantic buddy. It turns out not be that particular alien, but it still reinforces him in our thoughts.As I said, if you are trying to raise a child encouraging homosexuality, this is a perfect way to do it. If you're not sure you want to expose them at this age, as I don't, avoid this DVD. You really won't be missing much as far as a ""Halloween"" theme, because none of the episodes are really Halloween themed anyway.

In the episode titled ""Boo!"", Pocoyo enjoys sneaking up on and scaring his friends, until the tables turn and it's his friends who are doing the surprising! In ""Scary Noises"", Pato crashes the Vamoosh on a strange planet where he makes a new alien friend. In ""Detective Pocoyo"", Ellie looses her doll and accuses her friends of taking it, but it turns out she was responsible for the disappearance all along. Pocoyo, Pato and Baby Bird can't find their way back to the Vamoosh after visiting an alien friend on his home planet in the episode titled ""Lost in Space"". In ""Poczilla"", Pocoyo and Pato act out a comic book cartoon. Everyone thinks Sleepy Bird is a monster when Pocoyo's monster-decorated box falls on top of her in the episode titled ""Monster Mystery"". In ""Angry Alien"", a visitor from another planet tries to rule over Pocoyo's world but has a change of heart when he becomes friends with the inhabitants.

It was nice to have some Halloween entertainment for our little one that I knew would not give her a scare. Instead Pocoyo and friends kept her giggling at all their Halloween fun!

I think this has rubbed off on my kids because they love everything Halloween too! Pocoyo: Boo was our first Halloween DVD of the year so we were all ready to kick off the season with a good family fun DVD!I keep thinking at four and five my kids will outgrow Pocoyo soon because it seems a bit young to me but they still LOVE him! I don't know what it is about this little guy but it completely mesmerizes them and they literally sit still and stare at the TV the whole time he's on. I need to figure out the secret!With his fun friends, bright colors and silly sound effects, Pocoyo is music to my preschoolers ears and joy to their eyes. This DVD has seven new episodes including a few Halloween themed.They requested to watch Boo and Monster Mystery over and over again. I really wish these shows lasted longer than seven minutes because it doesn't give me much time to walk away and get anything done. Is that a legitimate complaint?
