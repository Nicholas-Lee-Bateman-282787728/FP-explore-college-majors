1618064,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00AWQEJPE,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I'm about to tell you something so shocking you might not believe me.  Something so incredible that only a talented writing team such as the ones who wrote Starlet could come up with.  Other than one particularly offensive and raw 2-minute scene, this movie is almost completely clear of any signs of pornography.  Absolutely amazing considering Starlet can't be mentioned without bringing up its storyline connection to the adult film industry.Now I've been told (or rather I read- I know nobody personally involved in the adult film business) that Starlet accurately portrays what it's like to be a porn star.  Judging the way these character act and interact with each other and the noticeable sense of lacking direction and immaturity they possess, I can actually believe it.  It's just incredible how the movie dances around such a touchy subject without being offensive (except, again, that 2-minute segment I mention above, which is undoubtedly a VERY rough and potentially uncomfortable 2 minutes for those turned off by such strong sexual content- you've been warned).I can imagine the porn lifestyle is dominated with heavy drug use, lots of partying and drinking, sleaziness, sitting around playing video games as a way to pass the time, being lazy/lacking ambition, low self-esteem and basically being a total bum all because they make so much money they don't really need to do anything else.  This is all well presented in Starlet and done so in a way that would feel natural to a porn star so while watching Starlet they'd be able to say ""Yes, this is what it's like!  I can relate!""  I can seriously imagine them being able to relate based on the very believable acting performances.And by the way I know for a fact not *all* porn stars fall under this category.  Many of them are more productive and civilized than the ones you hear about in the news or see portrayed in movies such as this, but unfortunately this is a very small category.  In fact Starlet proves not all adult actresses can be lumped together better than any other movie you will probably ever see.  While one of the actresses (Jane) is more outgoing, adventurous and kind, her roommate is more vindictive, unambitious and drugged out always in pursuit to make sure she gets the right amount of money she's earned (which is a scene you will discover later) and though her attitude is way out of line during this particular part of the movie, her intentions and reasons for doing so are arguably fair.Starlet is best described as a drama with elements of comedy.  In fact the comedy is mostly reserved for the beginning while the story is being told and the characters are yet to establish themselves, and the tone gradually shifts when the roommate/friend named Melissa (real name Stella Maeve) gets more attention.  Let me describe what Starlet is about without spoiling anything (which is something the wiki page on Starlet didn't do I'm afraid- wow do NOT read that page!  They spell out the entire movie word for word in the order the events happen!)It's about a young, caring and compassionate adult actress played by Drew Hemingway (named Jane in the film) that buys a thermos at a yard sale, and upon bringing it home discovers it's loaded with all kinds of cash.  She doesn't tell her roommate Melissa or Melissa's boyfriend (who Jane is living with).  Nope!  Instead she keeps and hides the money for herself.  Now this is where the movie gets interesting.  Jane wants to return the money to the old lady at the yard sale where she bought the thermos from, but... the old lady turns her away and tells her to leave.  Gradually, throughout the movie, Jane becomes friends with the old lady.  They hang out together, eat breakfast together, go to bingo together (including a hilarious bingo segment near the end)... all while the old lady reluctantly accepts this confusing newfound friendship (and understandably so) without having a single clue what Jane does for a living.  The old lady presents herself as a stubborn, often cranky but ultimately responsible and firm woman who just needs assistance getting around town.  This leads to more humorous and carefree segments thanks to Jane either creating mischief or mischief finding her!When Melissa discovers the money in Jane's bedroom by way of Jane's miniature (and adorable) dog chewing on it one day while Jane's away, this is when things get interesting.  Melissa doesn't confront Jane or ask her any questions initially. Rather Melissa plays it cool for a while but with an attitude proving she knows *something* but isn't speaking out, so for a while you're not sure what's going to happen when the money is finally mentioned.  I don't want to discuss anymore for fear of spoiling too much.  All I can say is that this movie is appropriate for anyone over the age of 22, and without that one sex scene I mention above, it would probably be appropriate for a broader age group.  The subject of sex isn't really brought up very often as shocking as it is to believe.Anyway the relationship between Jane and the old lady is really amazing.  You'd never guess that someone who does what Jane does for a living would present herself so open-mindedly and friendly, and this goes to show that perhaps I personally shouldn't judge others based on their professions (not that I do... well okay when it comes to the adult industry I think we're *all* guilty of judging them, right?)  The only thing that seemed off to me was the ending.  I didn't quite get it.  Actually I got it but I thought there was an extra something to it I may have missed so I had to search a website that explained the ending.  Apparently no, that's it.  It's sad but wraps up a fantastic story.Overall, very VERY good movie.  I highly recommend it.  The writers got this one right.",5,everyone's a star,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,5802,"[""'m"", 'tell', 'something', 'so', 'shocking', 'might', 'not', 'believe', 'Something', 'so', 'incredible',

1618065,A336ELI13OGMHJ,B00AWQEJPE,"Bill Lee, Author","[1, 1]","This is one of those thought-provoking movies that captures the human spirit. I truly believe that the success of this film is attributed to the fact that the filmmaker, Sean Baker, worked with a limited budget and preserved its indie status. Hence, he wrote, directed, and personally edited Starlet without interference from a big studio. Another advantage of working with limited resources is that you attract actors and crew members who are motivated, committed, and passionate about the project. Commentaries featured in the DVD confirm this.It's been days since I watched the video, but I'm still reflecting on the interactions between Jane and Sadie, especially the ending scenes. I'm looking forward to future film projects from Sean Baker, Dree Hemingway, and Stella Maeve. Sad to learn that Ms. Johnson passed away last month. Her first and only acting role in Starlet was superb.Additional thoughts, which include spoilers:I can't say enough about the clever screenplay, with its numerous twists and subtle details, which will attract viewers drawn to cerebral storylines. The source of the money found in the thermos is one example. Did Sadie hide it there or was it left there by her late husband -- a successful, professional gambler? The amount, denominations, how the money was wrapped, and modus operandi of gamblers would indicate the latter. The revelation that Sadie rarely ventured out (not requiring use of the thermos) after becoming a widow seem to support this theory. Yet, in the closing scenes at the gravesite, we learn that Sadie's husband died in 1969, but the ""Benjamins"" displayed in the film appear to be versions designed/circulated much later.

In fact, the sex workers (in this film at least) look at it as ""just another job"" with absolutely no regrets or emotional conflicts.

No, it wasn't hard core porn but it was certainly more than I expected a legitimate model and actress to do in a film. It was more graphic than what you might see on HBO or something like that.The film did not need that type of thing to make its point. She could have been a struggling actress as the film title suggests. The porn scenes don't add anything to the film or character so it seems they are only there for the prurient viewer.I had more fun watching the absolutely adorable dog, Dree's character's pet in the film. The dog's name is Starlet although it's a male dog. People should know what is in the film in case they think it's a sweet film about a grandmother and surrogate daughter and try to watch it with their own parent or grandparent.

1618073,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00AWQEJPE,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","This is an indy flick to the nines. It has an interesting story but the ending puzzled me.Here's the scoop. Jane is an adult movie actress. She rents a room from Mikey and Melissa. He sell drugs. She also acts in adult films. Jane has her little dog starlet and takes her on a garage sale junket to get stuff to fix up her room. She buys a thermos, from an elderly woman, that she wants to use as a vase. When she gets home she finds the vase is full of rolled up bills to the tune of about 10K. She is compelled to go back to the old woman to see.....what? If she would even miss the money? Is she destitute? But a relationship develops between the two as Jane's friends' situation deteriorates and things go south.This is a cool flick. Good writing. Particularly as concerns the characters. Jane makes adult films and seems curiously passive about it. She seems to not think much about it one way or the other. Melissa, on the other hand, is a total stroke, loser. Gets too high too often, can nowhere near manage her finances and is always coming apart at the seams. Mikey wants to be bigger in the adult film industry but has nowhere near the skills. Then there's Sadie, the elderly woman. What's her story? Married to a professional gambler who died from a heart attack. Left her oodles of dollars and no kids. Or were there? You see her suspicion of Jane straight off, but her walls get worn down. A relationship does develop but what's really happening? Is Jane merely guilty about not telling her about the money or is Sadie a mom she never really had? Is Sadie just lonely or is Jane the daughter she once had and lost.

I was compelled to find out what the fuss was about.Imagine my surprise; a well-written, well-crafted, simple story about integrity, good intentions and issues of the elderly. I won't give away some of the more sensational plot-points, but the plentiful DVD extras explain that first impressions should not make one judgmental regarding the true make up of a person. The talented Mr Baker lets you know these people before adding an interesting element that may shock some (I found it mildly amusing).Dree Hemingway is remarkable as Jane, a girl new to the San Fernando Valley, staying with friends while she establishes herself. She buys a thermos from a cranky old lady at a yard sale (the magnificent Besedka Johnson), later to find out there's $10K inside. This makes Jane uncomfortable, and she attempts to find out if the old lady might really need that money, a guilt-complex that results in an adventure of stalking, friendship, fondness, understanding and genuine love.At age 85, it was Johnson's first film role, and she handles it like a pro. It's Jane's integrity and perseverance to know this old woman that is the gist of the film, a sweetness that can't help but move the viewer. It's a beautifully controlled relationship starting with suspicion, mutual interests, leading to genuine caring. I was totally taken in. The film still resonates with me, though I saw it over a week ago.I won't give away the other plot points, but there are terrific supporting players; Stella Maeve as Jane's stoner best friend, Melissa, and James Ransone, great as Melissa's manic, stoner boyfriend.It is to Mr Baker's credit that he let you know the sweetness of Jane before he drops the ""bomb"", about one-third into the film. A great lesson to not judge people before you know how good they can be.It's ""Not Rated"", so be prepared for some surprises.

It stars Dree Hemmingway as Jane a 21 year old worker in the `adult entertainment industry'.  She buys a Thermos in a yard sale one day and on getting it home finds that it is stuffed with cash. She tries to take it back to the cantankerous old woman, whom she bought it from,  but is rebutted.So she engineers a way to be a `Good Samaritan' to Sadie (the late Besedka Johnson) with her faithful lapdog in tow - this is `Starlet' of the film title. What starts out as marked for failure in the relationship department soon blossoms into a real friendship. However, Jane lives with Melissa and Mikey - Melissa is one of those people who think the Universe revolves around them and everyone is here to do her a favour; so she finds it strange that her `besty' is hanging with an old lady and wont let it lie - to say more is straying into the realms of plot spoiling.As I mentioned this is a film that plays out slowly but it is interesting all the way and actually quite a lot does happen. Dree Hemmingway is superb as is the pooch but then there are convincing performances from everyone.

1618081,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00AWQEJPE,Turfseer,"[2, 6]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Starlet' refers to an adorable Chihuahua of the same name, owned by Jane (Dree Hemingway), an actor of the adult entertainment variety. Perhaps Jane aspires to be a starlet herself but is content when we first meet her, to room with two other denizens of the adult entertainment industry, coke-addicted Melissa and her pimp, Mikey, in a small but comfy San Fernando Valley apartment.Director Sean Bake has propelled Jane on a journey of redemption when she meets Sadie, an elderly woman, who is selling some of her personal items at a garage sale. After Jane buys an old vase from Sadie, a veritable curmudgeon, she brings it home and suddenly discovers $10,000, in rolled up $100 bills, hidden inside. Jane finds the money does come in handy and decides to keep it. But by the same token, she feels guilty and then attempts to befriend the old woman, perhaps as an act of penitence.At first Sadie is extremely suspicious of Jane's motives, culminating in Sadie's pepper spray attack on Jane, as the friendly porn actress drives her home. But now Sadie feels guilty how she treated Jane and decides to allow Jane into her life. There are forays to Sadie's weekly bingo game and later out to the cemetery, where Sadie wistfully places flowers on the grave of her long-deceased gambler husband (perhaps the husband stashed the money in the vase without Sadie's knowledge; or perhaps Sadie just plain forgot the money was inside the vase).Meanwhile, there's a sub-plot involving Melissa, who has a meltdown over her alleged mistreatment at the hands of her porn industry boss, with level-headed Jane coming to her rescue. When Starlet drags out the purse containing the pilfered cash, Melissa discovers the stash and decides to help herself to a few hundred for a few car down payments. Jane of course doesn't even notice. Eventually, the second act crisis involves Melissa, in a fit of jealousy, revealing to Sadie that Jane took her money.Jane and Melissa perhaps represent the dichotomy in the adult entertainment world. Porn actresses such as Jane, despite their involvement in a world that many consider sleazy, can still operate with their head above water. Case in point: her humanitarian concern for Sadie. Melissa, on the other hand, represents the dark side of porn--she is narcissistic, angry, jealous and vindictive. Mikey perhaps is more the comic relief--even both Jane and Melissa find that the pole he installs in the living room (for pole dancing), is ridiculous.Starlet's central problem is the poorly developed Sadie. She's played by Besedka Johnson, a neophyte, discovered at a local YWCA gym. Johnson can do little with a character that is so one-note and who we find out so little about. Some may find the relationship between Jane and Sadie to be touching but ultimately it really doesn't go anywhere. I would go so far as to say that the appeal of the relationship is strictly sentimental at its core. Nonetheless, Sadie's decision not to listen to Melissa's tirade against Jane, and ending up going with her to Paris, is proof of the film's inherent optimism.In the end, my feelings about 'Starlet' are ambivalent. I found the scenes involving the machinations within the adult entertainment world to be somewhat interesting. Less so with the perfunctory relationship between Jane and Sadie. 'Starlet' wins points because it suggests that even a porn actress can have a good heart. It also does well in examining the flip side: the aforementioned dark side of porn, embodied by the character of Melissa. Ultimately, the relationship between the principals proves to be too ordinary and lugubrious, to be considered dramatically effective.",3,'Boogie Nights' meets 'On Golden Pond',1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,3701,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Starlet"", 'refers', 'adorable', 'Chihuahua', 'same', 'name', 'owned', 'Jane', 'Dree', 'Hemingway', 'actor', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'variety', 'Perhaps', 'Jane', 'aspires', 'be', 'starlet', 'content', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'room', 'two', 'other', 'denizens', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'coke-addicted', 'Melissa', 'pimp', 'Mikey', 'small', 'comfy', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'apartment.Director', 'Sean', 'Bake', 'propelled', 'Jane', 'journey', 'redemption', 'when', 'Sadie', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'selling', 'personal', 'items', 'garage', 'sale', 'Jane', 'buys', 'old', 'vase', 'Sadie', 'veritable', 'curmudgeon', 'home', 'suddenly', 'discovers', '10,000', 'rolled', 'up', '100', 'bills', 'hidden', 'inside', 'Jane', 'money', 'come', 'handy', 'keep', 'same', 'token', 'guilty', 'then', 'attempts', 'befriend', 'old', 'woman', 'perhaps', 'act', 'penitence.At', 'first', 'Sadie', 'extremely', 'suspicious', 'Jane', 'motives', 'culminating', 'Sadie', 'pepper', 'spray', 'attack', 'Jane', 'friendly', 'porn', 'actress', 'home', 'now', 'Sadie', 'feels', 'guilty', 'how', 'treated', 'Jane', 'allow', 'Jane', 'life', 'are', 'forays', 'Sadie', 'weekly', 'bingo', 'game', 'later', 'cemetery', 'where', 'Sadie', 'wistfully', 'flowers', 'grave', 'long-deceased', 'gambler', 'husband', 'perhaps', 'husband', 'stashed', 'money', 'vase', 'Sadie', 'knowledge', 'perhaps', 'Sadie', 'just', 'plain', 'forgot', 'money', 'was', 'vase', '.Meanwhile', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Melissa', 'who', 'meltdown', 'alleged', 'mistreatment', 'hands', 'porn', 'industry', 'boss', 'level-headed', 'Jane', 'coming', 'rescue', 'When', 'Starlet', 'out', 'purse', 'containing', 'pilfered', 'cash', 'Melissa', 'stash', 'help', 'few', 'hundred', 'few', 'car', 'down', 'payments', 'Jane', 'course', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'Eventually', 'second', 'act', 'crisis', 'Melissa', 'fit', 'jealousy', 'revealing', 'Sadie', 'Jane', 'took', 'money.Jane', 'Melissa', 'perhaps', 'represent', 'dichotomy', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'world', 'Porn', 'actresses', 'such', 'Jane', 'involvement', 'world', 'many', 'consider', 'sleazy', 'can', 'still', 'operate', 'head', 'water', 'Case', 'point', 'humanitarian', 'concern', 'Sadie', 'Melissa', 'other', 'hand', 'dark', 'side', 'porn', 'narcissistic', 'angry', 'jealous', 'vindictive', 'Mikey', 'perhaps', 'more', 'comic', 'relief', 'even', 'Jane', 'Melissa', 'find', 'pole', 'living', 'room', 'pole', 'dancing', 'ridiculous.Starlet', 'central', 'problem', 'poorly', 'developed', 'Sadie', 'played', 'Besedka', 'Johnson', 'neophyte', 'discovered', 'local', 'YWCA', 'gym', 'Johnson', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'character', 'so', 'one-note', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'so', 'little', 'may', 'find', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'Sadie', 'be', 'touching', 'ultimately', 'really', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'appeal', 'relationship', 'strictly', 'sentimental', 'core', 'Nonetheless', 'Sadie', 'decision', 'not', 'listen', 'Melissa', 'tirade', 'Jane', 'ending', 'up', 'going', 'Paris', 'proof', 'film', 'inherent', 'end', 'feelings', ""'Starlet"", 'are', 'ambivalent', 'found', 'scenes', 'involving', 'machinations', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'world', 'be', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'Less', 'perfunctory', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'Sadie', 'wins', 'points', 'even', 'porn', 'actress', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'heart', 'also', 'well', 'examining', 'flip', 'side', 'aforementioned', 'dark', 'side', 'porn', 'embodied', 'character', 'Melissa', 'Ultimately', 'relationship', 'principals', 'be', 'too', 'ordinary', 'lugubrious', 'be', 'considered', 'dramatically', 'effective']",Starlet
