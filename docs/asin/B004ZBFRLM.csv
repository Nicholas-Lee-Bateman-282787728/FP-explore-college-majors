1434491,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B004ZBFRLM,C McGhee,"[1, 9]",CHERRY starring Kyle Gallner & Brittany Robertson.Supposedly a funny coming of age movie in which a virginal college freshman falls in love with a 31 yr. old freshman that has a 14 yr. old daughter who falls in love with him. I thought this could be really funny & touching at the same time but the characters are just toons. I never felt that this was happening to people & therefore could of cared less about what happened to them. A 40 yr. Old Virgin remake or more like a scaled down American Pie with Adult toons thrown in. If you want to see a penis under a wooden ruler this is your show.

1434492,A108XP24UESKSV,B004ZBFRLM,"E. Kay ""eclectic6""","[5, 5]","This movie is about Aaron, a 17-year-old who just went away to college. His parents expect him to be an engineer, but Aaron is drawn (pun intended) to the arts. In an art class, Aaron meets a 30-something student named Linda, and they become fast friends. But Aaron finds himself attracted to her... and Linda's 14-year-old daughter is attracted to him. Along the way, he also has to deal with his oversexed roommate and overprotective mother.What really carries this film is the wonderful performances by all the actors. The always-impressive Kyle Gallner (who I usually see in horror films) is very likable as Aaron. How is this actor not a star?! However, I was most impressed by Britt Robertson, who plays the 14-year-old (I was shocked to find out she's 21 in real life..she truly did look like a teenager!) Britt's performance is multi-layered and expertly played.",4,Very good movie,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,870,"['movie', 'Aaron', '17-year-old', 'who', 'just', 'went', 'away', 'college', 'parents', 'expect', 'be', 'engineer', 'Aaron', 'drawn', 'pun', 'intended', 'arts', 'art', 'class', 'Aaron', '30-something', 'student', 'named', 'Linda', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', 'Aaron', 'attracted', 'Linda', '14-year-old', 'daughter', 'attracted', 'way', 'also', 'deal', 'oversexed', 'roommate', 'overprotective', 'mother.What', 'really', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'actors', 'always-impressive', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'who', 'usually', 'see', 'horror', 'films', 'very', 'likable', 'Aaron', 'How', 'actor', 'not', 'star', 'However', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'Britt', 'Robertson', 'who', '14-year-old', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'out', '21', 'real', 'life..she', 'truly', 'did', 'look', 'teenager', 'Britt', 'performance', 'multi-layered', 'expertly', 'played']",Cherry
1434493,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004ZBFRLM,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 2]","Indy flicks are alive and well and this is a good one to wrap your head around.Here's the scoop. Aaron is in college, ahead of his time, enrolled in an advanced engineering program. His mom is overbearing and his dad in milquetoast. He really would rather be an artist. He gets involved with and older woman student who has a rough past. Her daughter starts to dig him and there is kind of a cool female student in the wings. It all gets really messy.As in all good indy films the writing and acting are at the heart. The set-ups might not be too original, and you see fairly early on where these set-ups might lead, but it's still full of surprises. Aaron is younger than his classmates and gets involved with things that are beyond his years. He navigates through the situations as best he can but they are messy and he's lucky he's smart and has a good heart. A lesser person would have been eaten alive. He likes Linda, the older woman. He's too young for her. Her daughter likes him. She's too young for him. Then there's Wes (Esai Morales) who's a cop also in love with Linda. Each character is on the brink of going off the deep end. They stumble and bumble but end up none the worse for wear.They dot the film with glimpses of his artwork and fill it with a lot of nifty tunes. Enough was spent on production to give it a professional sheen. You like these folks. None of them are bad. They just have issues that are at odds with one another. Aaron is having difficulty with his big engineering project (walking on water) so the viewer really wants to see if he'll nail it. How will the relationships work out. I was satisfied with the way things played out. Everybody wins (or at least doesn't lose) in a way that didn't seem too pat. Kyle Gallner, as Aaron, played the doe-eyed card a bit too much. Esai was steady. Laura Allen and Britt Robertson did well as mom and daughter. Zosia Mamet as Darcy left me wanting more. I would like to see a sequel to see if her and Aaron have any relationship in the future.This is a cool flick with a lot going for it. If indy films are your poison, this should do you well.",4,This Cherry Has More than One Stem,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,2121,"['Indy', 'flicks', 'are', 'alive', 'well', 'good', 'one', 'wrap', 'head', 'scoop', 'Aaron', 'college', 'ahead', 'time', 'enrolled', 'advanced', 'engineering', 'program', 'mom', 'overbearing', 'dad', 'milquetoast', 'really', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'artist', 'involved', 'older', 'woman', 'student', 'who', 'rough', 'past', 'daughter', 'dig', 'kind', 'cool', 'female', 'student', 'wings', 'really', 'messy.As', 'good', 'indy', 'films', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'heart', 'set-ups', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'original', 'see', 'fairly', 'early', 'where', 'set-ups', 'might', 'lead', 'still', 'full', 'surprises', 'Aaron', 'younger', 'classmates', 'involved', 'things', 'are', 'years', 'situations', 'can', 'are', 'messy', 'lucky', 'smart', 'good', 'heart', 'lesser', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'eaten', 'alive', 'Linda', 'older', 'woman', 'too', 'young', 'daughter', 'too', 'young', 'Then', 'Wes', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'who', 'cop', 'also', 'love', 'Linda', 'character', 'brink', 'going', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'stumble', 'bumble', 'end', 'up', 'none', 'worse', 'wear.They', 'dot', 'film', 'glimpses', 'artwork', 'fill', 'lot', 'nifty', 'tunes', 'Enough', 'was', 'spent', 'production', 'give', 'professional', 'sheen', 'folks', 'None', 'are', 'bad', 'just', 'have', 'issues', 'are', 'odds', 'one', 'Aaron', 'having', 'difficulty', 'big', 'engineering', 'project', 'walking', 'water', 'viewer', 'really', 'see', ""'ll"", 'nail', 'How', 'will', 'relationships', 'work', 'out', 'was', 'satisfied', 'way', 'things', 'played', 'out', 'Everybody', 'least', ""n't"", 'lose', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'pat', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'Aaron', 'played', 'doe-eyed', 'card', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Esai', 'was', 'steady', 'Laura', 'Allen', 'Britt', 'Robertson', 'did', 'well', 'mom', 'daughter', 'Zosia', 'Mamet', 'Darcy', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'sequel', 'see', 'Aaron', 'have', 'relationship', 'future.This', 'cool', 'flick', 'lot', 'going', 'indy', 'films', 'are', 'poison', 'should', 'do', 'well']",Cherry

A real well made and much enjoyable film from a real good writer and director. The acting was very good from all of the characters. It takes me back to some of the typical hi-jinx from my college days!! A real high-ho to Britt Robertson who is a real good young actress! I have seen her before in a couple of other recent films and she is quite good.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[2, 4]","As you might expect from the title, this entry in the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival concerns itself with a freshman entering college saddled with an inconvenient virginity. I automatically braced myself for a snicker and grin T & A-type toga party, but had to quickly alter my expectations. Although there are a few bongs around, the story quickly evolves into a far more complicated one.There are no ""name brand"" actors in the cast, so I'll just talk about the characters:* Our hero is a talented artist but his parents are determined that he will be an engineer. His roommate is such a successful lothario, our guy quickly becomes sleep deprived.* One fellow student in his art class is a gorgeous woman (NOT a girl!) who seems flirtatious and approachable. There is a reason why she doesn't drink, though.* Our hero's roommate is the stereotypical horndog whose life is a constant party. He isn't above a practical joke or two, either.* A delectable 14-year-old girl gets a BIG crush on our hero. Problem is, she's the daughter of that gorgeous woman in his art class!* The parents footing the bill for this iffy college career are understandably concerned.This is a film that will have trouble finding an audience. It's too dramatic for a comedy; too funny for a drama; doesn't have enough sex for a toga party; has too much sex for a family film.Hmmm...Our hangdog hero will eventually have his day, though.

Aaron is one of those smart people and he in college at the age of 17. He get's into a top Ivy league school and in a tough engineering program. But, we see him not too interested in it as to in his Art class. This is where he meets Linda and she 30 something years ago. He learns a lot from her and they become friends. Later he finds out that she has a 14 year daughter, Beth.Beth is very independent and very different from Linda. Beth really gets on Aaron neves. But, he still okay with that and starts to fall for Linda. He then finds out Linda has a BF, West and is so, so about Linda. But, starts to like Beth.Now, everything starts to fall apart and Aaron is in the middle of everything and he starts to come to age now. He helps out Linda, Beth, and West with their problems and they become a family at the end. Aaron learns more about life and what it has to offer and he is well on his way to get on with his new life.I felt this movie had a great plot and characters.
