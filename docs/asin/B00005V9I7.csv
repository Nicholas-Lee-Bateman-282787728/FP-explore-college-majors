Stuckey ""kateling""","[5, 6]","A book-to-movie is not always easy and this movie has moments where it is not quite up to par with the book, but the underlying message still comes through.  It is a great story of the things we do, whether we want to or not, for the good of the whole and also of the ties that bind. Plus, Glenne Headley is a stitch as the matriarch Ingrid. Anyone who has ever felt insecure or out-of-place will appreciate this movie (and be glad it's not your family!).",4,"Worse than some, better than a lot",1037491200,"11 17, 2002",2002,455,"['book-to-movie', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'movie', 'moments', 'where', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'book', 'underlying', 'message', 'still', 'great', 'story', 'things', 'do', 'want', 'not', 'good', 'whole', 'also', 'ties', 'bind', 'Glenne', 'Headley', 'stitch', 'matriarch', 'Ingrid', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'insecure', 'out-of-place', 'will', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'be', 'glad', 'not', 'family']",The Sandy Bottom Orchestra

688145,A1FNW6H983I87V,B00005V9I7,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[4, 4]","This is a Hallmark/Showtime made for TV movie adapted from the Novel by Garrison Keillor who also acted as a consultant for the movie. Norman is the father who dreams of conducting classical music and practices while shaving and managing his herd of dairy cows. Ingrid is the mother who gave up a promising musical career to marry Norman and live in the small community of Sandy Bottom, WI. She is also the town activist. Rachel is the 14 year old daughter who has inherited her mother's musical talent but can't find a place in school where all her friends are into girls' baseball and cheerleading. Can this out of place family find a way to connect with the rest of the townspeople or will they will be forever the joke of the community. This is a movie about life in a small town and the agony of growing up different. It's about family and friends and community and the problems and crises they experience. And it wouldn't be a Garrison Keillor story without a Lutheran Church that is somewhat dysfunctional about its music. While this could easily have turned out sappy and syrupy, it's quite satisfying emotionally and intellectually. It's definitely as family friendly as they come. No sex, no violence, one bad word that I can remember, it's a Hallmark film in their best tradition. Enjoy!! Lu G. for Lu's Reviews.
