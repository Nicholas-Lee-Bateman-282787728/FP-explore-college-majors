Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 9]","In this, the third 4-episode season of the PBS series - the ""genres"" covered are ""Funny Ladies"", ""Prime Time Soaps"", ""Superheroes"" and ""Miniseries"" Of course, as the seasons continue they need to find new ""genres"" to cover. It's been a while since I watched the first two seasons but it seemed to me that, this time they concentrated each episode on less shows - most often, only two or three. They did get a lot of celebrities to be interviewed (and some crossed genres, like Joan Collins in both ""Primetime Soaps"" (""Dynasty"") and ""Superheroes"" (Batman).Each episode runs 55 minutes.Funny Ladies concentrated on Mary Tyler Moore and her appearances on The Dick Van Dyke Show as well as her own series. Carol Burnett is shown on the Gary More Show and then her own Variety Show. Betty White - the one with the longest career is shown on her MANY shows. And then there are the standup comediennes Joan Rivers and Phyllis Diller (in her last recorded interview).Prime Time Soaps spends all it's time on the big three from the late 70s - Dallas, Knots Landing and Dynasty.Superheros spend MOST of the time on Batman while also covering 4 more: Superman from the 1950s (but in COLOR!), The Incredible Hulk, Wonder Woman and The Greatest American Hero.The Miniseries episode spends the first 27 minutes on Roots - the most watched TV series at that time. They seem to have interviewed nearly all the major cast members and there are lots of clips. The remain time is spent on just two other series: Rich Man, Poor Man and The Thorne Birds. (the latter has actress Rachel Ward describing how here role was so badly cast, that it ended her acting career.)Ryan Seachrist is the narrator for all the episodes in Season 3. Each Episode ends with a few minutes of ""Trivia Quiz"" about the shows covered and each of the two DVDs has 4 short interview outtakes (two from each of the episodes on the disc.)While I didn't feel they covered enough of 1950 and 1960 TV as they have in the past, the series does capture and preserve the cast members memories and - especially if you were a fan of these genres - you'll enjoy it.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Four more genres are covered with LOTS of ne2w cast member interviews,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,2200,"['third', '4-episode', 'season', 'PBS', 'series', 'genres', 'covered', 'are', 'Funny', 'Ladies', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Soaps', 'Superheroes', 'Miniseries', 'course', 'seasons', 'continue', 'need', 'find', 'new', 'genres', 'cover', 'been', 'while', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'time', 'concentrated', 'episode', 'less', 'shows', 'most', 'often', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'did', 'get', 'lot', 'celebrities', 'be', 'interviewed', 'crossed', 'genres', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Primetime', 'Soaps', 'Dynasty', 'Superheroes', 'Batman', '.Each', 'episode', '55', 'minutes.Funny', 'Ladies', 'concentrated', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'appearances', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'series', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'shown', 'Gary', 'More', 'Show', 'then', 'own', 'Variety', 'Show', 'Betty', 'White', 'one', 'longest', 'career', 'shown', 'MANY', 'shows', 'then', 'are', 'standup', 'comediennes', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'last', 'recorded', 'interview', '.Prime', 'Time', 'Soaps', 'time', 'big', 'three', 'late', '70s', 'Dallas', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'Dynasty.Superheros', 'spend', 'MOST', 'time', 'Batman', 'also', 'covering', '4', 'more', 'Superman', '1950s', 'COLOR', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero.The', 'Miniseries', 'episode', 'first', '27', 'minutes', 'Roots', 'most', 'watched', 'TV', 'series', 'time', 'seem', 'have', 'interviewed', 'nearly', 'major', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'lots', 'clips', 'remain', 'time', 'spent', 'just', 'two', 'other', 'series', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'Thorne', 'Birds', 'latter', 'actress', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'describing', 'how', 'here', 'role', 'was', 'so', 'badly', 'cast', 'ended', 'acting', 'career', 'Ryan', 'Seachrist', 'narrator', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'Episode', 'few', 'minutes', 'Trivia', 'Quiz', 'shows', 'covered', 'two', 'DVDs', '4', 'short', 'interview', 'outtakes', 'two', 'episodes', 'disc', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'covered', 'enough', '1950', '1960', 'TV', 'have', 'past', 'series', 'capture', 'preserve', 'cast', 'members', 'memories', 'especially', 'were', 'fan', 'genres', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Pioneers of Television: Season 3
