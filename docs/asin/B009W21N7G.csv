When I saw the trailer for this film a few months ago, I immediately felt drawn to it. Once I actually got around to watching Now is Good, I felt a little cheated. First off, I thought Fanning gave a brave and tough as nails performance as Tessa, a young teenager dying of cancer. But the pace of the film is rather slow and overwrought. I felt the writing was a little flat, and the relationship she has with her uninvolved mother was a little clich&eacute;. Tessa eventually falls in love with a handsome, nice guy but I felt that relationship was also clich&eacute; and I felt they had no passion for each other. I just didn't feel anything towards the end of the film, it's a mixed bag for me.",3,A letdown.,1368662400,"05 16, 2013",2013,773,"['Now', 'Good', 'starring', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'left', 'feeling', 'empty', 'disappointed', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'few', 'months', 'immediately', 'felt', 'drawn', 'Once', 'actually', 'got', 'watching', 'Now', 'Good', 'felt', 'little', 'cheated', 'First', 'thought', 'Fanning', 'gave', 'brave', 'tough', 'nails', 'performance', 'Tessa', 'young', 'teenager', 'dying', 'cancer', 'pace', 'film', 'rather', 'slow', 'overwrought', 'felt', 'writing', 'was', 'little', 'flat', 'relationship', 'uninvolved', 'mother', 'was', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Tessa', 'eventually', 'love', 'handsome', 'nice', 'guy', 'felt', 'relationship', 'was', 'also', 'clich', 'eacute', 'felt', 'had', 'passion', 'other', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'end', 'film', 'mixed', 'bag']",N/A

She has always brought an amazing truth to her roles, and has always been able to bring emotions out of her audiences, almost as if she had popped out of the screen and was there in person.  This movie exemplifies how she can make a simple story into a riveting performance.This movie shirks all of the glitz and glam and special effects that Hollywood often uses and it instead is a simple premise showing the emotional struggle of a girl who is facing death.  She dropped out of school to deal with her illness and ended up battling cancer for four years, throughout which she has womanhood thrust upon her.  The movie gracefully explores difficult themes, such as how hard we try to hold on to what we love, how we can rationalize any kind of behavior, and how a few months can almost reverse peoples character.This movie does hit home to me, not because I lost anyone particularly close but in high school I knew a girl who went through this experience.  To this day, more than a decade later, I remember every word of every conversation that we had, though few, as she mainly stayed home.  There was something eerily haunting about talking to that girl who looked so young and yet spoke with an unshakeable brevity and serene calmness.  It was as though decades of living had somehow been lived within her thin, frail body.  And somehow, Dakota Fanning has captured this essence perfectly.

Adapted by Director/Screenwriter Ol Parker form Jenny Downham's novel `Before I Die', the film deals with delicate issues in a mature way and allows the emotional aspect of the film's theme to soar into that realm of films that deal with death in an honest and respectful way.Tessa Scott (Dakota Fanning in a miraculous performance with a perfect British accent!) is diagnosed with leukemia. Despite her four-year devotion to chemotherapy she has discovered that her cancer is terminal and her doctors don't give her very long to live. Tessa with the help of her best friend Zoey (Kaya Scodelario) comes up with a list of things she wants to do before she dies, including some risky behaviors that she deems necessary to have ""lived"". Tessa's dad (Paddy Considine) is resistant to Tessa's behavior from the start but realizes he has little influence and can only enjoy the time they have left. Best friend Zoey is excited and supportive of the outrageous bucket list until an unplanned pregnancy test comes up positive. Tessa's parents are divorced and have very different views on her desire to experience the dangerous side of life before she passes. Her mother (Olivia Williams) simply cannot deal with the diagnosis and copes by distancing herself from Tessa's activities and is more or less absentee in her role as a mother. Her father's main mechanism for coping is denial. Tessa mentions that he spends hours on the computer looking up possible treatments for her even after the doctors have told her that the cancer has consumed her body. Tessa's little brother Cal (Edgar Canham) is a brutally honest individual that has mixed feelings ranging from lack of care to jealousy to sadness. In the beginning of the novel Cal says to his sister ""I'm gonna miss you"" during a joking situation. One of Tessa's last wishes is to find love, of which she thinks she has with her neighbor Adam (Jeremy Irvine whose performance here is as fine as his War Horse role). Adam is shy and his main priority is taking care of his sickly mother after their father died. But Tessa's gradually breaks through Adam's fears and the two fall in love, Adam promising to stay with Tessa until the end. The film follows her last few months of life, explores her relationships with her loved ones, and her personal feelings about being trapped in a failing body. The film is tenderly brought to a credible and touching close - everyone has grown to appreciate that `now is good'.Dakota Fanning rises to new heights in her sensitive portrayal and her skills are matched by inimitable performances by Paddy Considine, Olivia Williams, Jeremy Irvine, Kaya Scodelario and a superb supporting cast. This is a very beautiful film that begs to be seen and understood.  Never sanguine, it is just an honest piece of life - and death.

Not sure why they chose acute lymphoblastic leukemia as the terminal illness for the protagonist.  Maybe because it&#8217;s a fairly common type of cancer, and most people have heard about it.  They could have chosen a more deadly type of leukemia, like acute myeloid.  ALL is highly curable, especially in children and teenagers.  However, if you stop treatment cold turkey during a relapse, you don&#8217;t go on living for months. You&#8217;ll be dead in a week.  Clearly, the writers have not done their homework.  The protagonist, Tessa, is not credible and not sympathetic.  A dying teenage protagonist whose idea of &#8220;embracing life&#8221; by shoplifting, getting arrested and mouthing off to her stay-at-home dad is just barf-worthy.

Not only is he a total eye candy, he also has the wisdom of Aesoph and the compassion of Mother Theresa.  He commits to spending a few months holding Tessa in his arms.

Her slightly older pal - the gorgeous and effortlessly sexy Zoey has no problems with 'doing' her boyfriend Scott - she's just not so good at keeping what his young loins have deposited (nicely played by Kaya Scoldelario). Tessa hasn't been so naughty yet but she wants to be. She wants to have sex, swill beer, pop a few pills, hit a racist, ride a wave in Hawaii, ski down a mountain and on a boring weekday maybe even engage in a bit of shoplifting in the mall (breaking the law). The only problem with Tessa's 'bucket list' of moments is that she's running out of time because she has acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Worse - Tessa couldn't stand the chemotherapy for such an aggressive cancer and has chosen to opt out - so now she desperately wants to fulfil her list (""as much as I can...as fast as I can..."").Her father and mother (a superlative combination of British actors Paddy Considine and Olivia Williams) are separated and poles apart. Uber-responsible loving Dad cares too much - suffocating Tessa (Dakota Fanning) with his need to control every part of her life in a bid to protect her from pain - while flighty Mum can't even seem to turn up on time for a crucial hospital appointment. Her 9-year old younger brother Cal worries too in his own soppy way (a natural and delightful Edgar Canham) ""are you gonna haunt me..."" But then hope arrives in the shape of a handsome and genuine English lad who literally moves in next door with his mum (Jeremy Irvine generously giving the screen and movie to Fanning). Adam's father has died the year earlier and Tessa and Adam's initial meets are awkward and even reluctant (occasionally funny) but then the two slowly move towards each other despite their pasts and her lack of a future. And on it goes. This is a girl wanting love and finding it - wanting to matter - and realizing that she actually does...Written and Directed by Ol Parker (adapted from Jenny Downham's book ""Before I Die"") - ""Now Is Good"" is a bit of a weepy for sure - but what makes it life-affirming and special are the beautifully realized performances by all of its lead actors (especially the phenomenal Dakota Fanning who never once lets that American accent slip and maintains a perfectly judged calmness throughout) and the depth in the script. As you can imagine material like this could be mawkish if handled badly - but ""Now Is Good"" never feels manipulative. The sentimentality is kept in check by candid and at times brutal exchanges between Tessa and her father and the new visiting home nurse Phillippa (superb work by Rayke Ayola).""Now Is Good"" is also that rare thing - tender and observant - full of great moments - seeing a daughter and mum at the front door of their home connect (""don't be afraid...""), sitting on a bench in the sunshine overlooking the White Cliffs of Dover, holding her first proper boyfriend on the bus home, fireworks at night in the garden with family, cooking breakfast for Dad (""who are you and what have you done with my daughter...""), Adam carving a snow angel in the ground, horses running free beside a set of iron railings in a park as they glide by on a motorbike, Nurse Phillippa humanely describing to Tessa how the end will come... Special mention should also go to the exceptional music by Dustin O'Halloran that fills so many scenes with emotion - fun and flighty one minute - aching and broken the next - an amazing piece of work.A BLU RAY of ""Now Is Good"" appears NOT to be available in the UK or USA. My copy is a German issue that I purchased on the GERMAN AMAZON SITE (use Barcode Number 887654313492 in their Search Bar). For some reason this reasonably priced version is not for sale on Amazon UK? When you do get your copy - as the movie starts - you will need to go to the Audio button on your remote and actually seek out the English 5.1 DTS-HD Audio track - or it'll play the film overdubbed in German.Defaulted to 2.35:1 aspect ratio (bars on top and bottom) or even stretched to full screen - the picture quality is absolutely beautiful throughout and as already mentioned - the audio is warm, full and gorgeous.The extras feature interviews with all the lead cast filmed in Hi Def (how they approached the roles and working with the other actors) and Director Ol Parker heaping praise on his cast (especially Dakota Fanning for 'going for it'). There's also Deleted Scenes and a very long behind the cameras B-Roll segment with the actors and crew (shots of Brighton Beach and Town, White Cliffs Of Dover, Epping Forest, Leyton Ice Rink).Like many - I came to this movie not expecting much and was more than surprised - I was moved. Using the parlance - ""Now Is Good"" is smart enough to keep it real - and by doing so - has captured in film and sound a loveliness that is rare.

So powerful, so real, so painful.Ive always loved her work as a child, especially in Man on Fire, and I think everyone had figured she would eventually grow up to be an amazing actress, and this performance right here is truly worthy of a gold statue.

1602794,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B009W21N7G,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 2]","""Now is Good"" is a loving and an equally heartbreaking story, a family's story, which demands that you consider your own life.  To concentrate on the people you love and the things that you wish to do.  A rare non cliched film that hits with a solid and believable punch of sentimentality.  Written and directed by Ol Parker, for me the story concentrates on the relationship of Tessa Scott (Dakota Fanning) and her father (Paddy Considine - wonderful in this portrayal) just as much as her relationship with her new love, Adam (Jeremy Irvine). Although, the central relationship that I found in this story is Tessa's relationship with her own feelings while they come closer to the surface as her illness gets worse.Tessa is a young lady of seventeen who is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a form of cancer which is a terminal illness in her case and did not respond well to chemotherapy.  Because of the demands on her body, Tessa gives up on the procedure and decides to live out her limited life doing, feeling, and being involved in the time that she has left.  An amazing and believable performance by Dakota Fanning, who never breaks character or her British accent as the movie is set in the coastal city of Brighton in the southern part of England.  Her loving and protective father cannot bear to watch his daughter leave him. Reluctantly, and with much reservation, he watches her go through a self-made list of quite reckless behaviors that she feels she will miss out on later.  Some of the time they are mainly excessive acts of rebellion and also the happiness she is seeking.Tessa's parents are separated, and her mother (Olivia Williams) basically appears clueless while keeping herself away from the family dynamic, is absent from doctor appointments, from Tessa's day to day experiences, etc. For myself, Williams played a quite different type character.  Tessa lives with her father and little brother who is curious and definitely speaks his mind - ""Will I still be your brother when you're dead?"".  Her best friend Zoey (Kaya Scodelario) is a funny and an even mannered teen who neither coddles her, nor considers her a 'sick' friend.  Zoey doesn't always make the wisest decisions in her own life, nor involving her boyfriend. In the long run a certain course will end happily for Tessa.The curious direction of this film is its ability to stay almost upbeat covering a horrible situation, although Tessa is not your ordinary girl.  While viewing Tessa, one thinks of all her other attributes, which are many, and not so much on her illness for quite a bit of the film.  She is cynically funny, self-deprecating, and facetiously sarcastic.  Refusing to fall into the 'different' type girl category, she keeps fighting and most of the time you can almost put aside that she is suffering having cancer as she acts just like any young lady her age.  She does have that list though, and to top it is to fall into a real and intimate love which she does with her new next-door neighbor, Adam, as he does with her.  They are a great match and try to squeeze every breath out of life, although the film doesn't feel overly romantic, this is Tessa's story.  She is able to take things much less seriously than her father and vaguely forget her circumstance. This is what she wishes to do.  In the heat of a moment she calls her father ""cancer obsessed"".  He is not. He loves her dearly and certainly does an astounding job of constantly showing it, containing a daily check on her health.  His performance is delicately layered as he bounces between frustration towards an unfair world that would take his daughter from him and Adam stealing her time away (a ""father's worst nightmare, the day he meets the boyfriend"").The scenery is beautifully shot (Erik Wilson) while they are by the coastline riding Adam's motorbike, up in a tree in the density of a green and wooded forest, along the small shops that line the streets of Brighton with Zoey, and definitely alongside the living ocean by a cozy and romantic fire while on the sand.  Their romance is slower, interactive and sweet for a young lady and her newly found love.  They discuss plans while in a winter white snowfall sitting on a park bench in the evening.  Soothing music (Dustin O'Hallaran) drifts along an endearing story that will make you think, and will have you crying both happy and sad tears throughout.",5,"""I'm Going To Tell You Something And You Have To Promise Not To Tell Anyone"" - Tessa",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,4403,"['Now', 'Good', 'loving', 'equally', 'heartbreaking', 'story', 'family', 'story', 'consider', 'own', 'life', 'concentrate', 'people', 'love', 'things', 'wish', 'do', 'rare', 'non', 'cliched', 'film', 'solid', 'believable', 'punch', 'sentimentality', 'Written', 'directed', 'Ol', 'Parker', 'story', 'relationship', 'Tessa', 'Scott', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'father', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'relationship', 'new', 'love', 'Adam', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'central', 'relationship', 'found', 'story', 'Tessa', 'relationship', 'own', 'feelings', 'come', 'closer', 'surface', 'illness', 'worse.Tessa', 'young', 'lady', 'seventeen', 'who', 'suffering', 'acute', 'lymphoblastic', 'leukemia', 'form', 'cancer', 'terminal', 'illness', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'respond', 'well', 'chemotherapy', 'demands', 'body', 'Tessa', 'up', 'procedure', 'decides', 'live', 'out', 'limited', 'life', 'doing', 'feeling', 'being', 'involved', 'time', 'left', 'amazing', 'believable', 'performance', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'never', 'breaks', 'character', 'British', 'accent', 'movie', 'set', 'coastal', 'city', 'Brighton', 'southern', 'part', 'England', 'loving', 'protective', 'father', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'watch', 'daughter', 'leave', 'Reluctantly', 'much', 'reservation', 'go', 'self-made', 'list', 'quite', 'reckless', 'behaviors', 'will', 'miss', 'out', 'later', 'time', 'are', 'mainly', 'excessive', 'acts', 'rebellion', 'also', 'happiness', 'seeking.Tessa', 'parents', 'are', 'separated', 'mother', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'basically', 'clueless', 'keeping', 'away', 'family', 'dynamic', 'absent', 'doctor', 'appointments', 'Tessa', 'day', 'day', 'experiences', 'etc', 'Williams', 'played', 'quite', 'different', 'type', 'character', 'Tessa', 'father', 'little', 'brother', 'who', 'curious', 'definitely', 'speaks', 'mind', 'Will', 'still', 'be', 'brother', 'when', ""'re"", 'dead', 'best', 'friend', 'Zoey', 'Kaya', 'Scodelario', 'funny', 'even', 'mannered', 'teen', 'who', ""'sick"", 'friend', 'Zoey', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'wisest', 'decisions', 'own', 'life', 'involving', 'boyfriend', 'long', 'run', 'certain', 'course', 'will', 'end', 'happily', 'Tessa.The', 'curious', 'direction', 'film', 'ability', 'stay', 'almost', 'upbeat', 'covering', 'horrible', 'situation', 'Tessa', 'not', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'viewing', 'Tessa', 'one', 'thinks', 'other', 'attributes', 'are', 'many', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'illness', 'quite', 'bit', 'film', 'cynically', 'funny', 'self-deprecating', 'facetiously', 'sarcastic', 'Refusing', 'fall', ""'different"", 'type', 'girl', 'category', 'fighting', 'most', 'time', 'can', 'almost', 'put', 'aside', 'suffering', 'having', 'cancer', 'just', 'young', 'lady', 'age', 'have', 'list', 'top', 'fall', 'real', 'intimate', 'love', 'new', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Adam', 'are', 'great', 'match', 'try', 'squeeze', 'breath', 'life', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'overly', 'romantic', 'Tessa', 'story', 'able', 'take', 'things', 'much', 'less', 'seriously', 'father', 'vaguely', 'forget', 'circumstance', 'what', 'do', 'heat', 'moment', 'father', 'cancer', 'obsessed', 'not', 'dearly', 'certainly', 'astounding', 'job', 'constantly', 'showing', 'containing', 'daily', 'check', 'health', 'performance', 'delicately', 'layered', 'frustration', 'unfair', 'world', 'would', 'take', 'daughter', 'Adam', 'stealing', 'time', 'away', 'father', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'day', 'boyfriend', '.The', 'scenery', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Erik', 'Wilson', 'are', 'coastline', 'riding', 'Adam', 'motorbike', 'up', 'tree', 'density', 'green', 'wooded', 'forest', 'small', 'shops', 'line', 'streets', 'Brighton', 'Zoey', 'definitely', 'living', 'ocean', 'cozy', 'romantic', 'fire', 'sand', 'romance', 'slower', 'interactive', 'sweet', 'young', 'lady', 'newly', 'found', 'love', 'discuss', 'plans', 'winter', 'white', 'snowfall', 'sitting', 'park', 'bench', 'evening', 'Soothing', 'music', 'Dustin', ""O'Hallaran"", 'endearing', 'story', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'crying', 'happy', 'sad', 'tears']",N/A

Perhaps you have seen such films as ""My Life Without Me"" starring Sarah Polley, ""The Theory of Flight"" starring Helena Bonham Carter, and more recently ""Restless"" starring Mia Wasikowska. These three films, though with varied degrees of success, all benefit from the strong acting from the leading player, and now another film arrives from UK with Dakota Fanning as a terminally ill teenage girl Tessa Scott, who falls in love with her shy and kind-hearted neighbor Adam (Jeremy Irvine).As I said above, the story is nothing new. Based on a novel ""Before I Die"" by Jenny Downham, ""Now is Good"" is about a 16-year-old girl dying of leukemia, who makes a list of what she wants to do before dying. With this kind of story you expect the film will become sentimental. Yes, it does at times, but not too much so.Written and directed with confidence and sensitivity by Ol Parker (writer/director of ""Imagine Me & You"" better known for his work as screenwriter for ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel""), ""Now is Good"" delivers the goods with several truly moving scenes. Dakota Fanning and Jeremy Irvine (star of Spielberg's ""War Horse"") are both fantastic, but equally great are Paddy Considine as Tessa's protective father and Olivia Williams as her estranged mother. The characters are all flawed but ultimately likable, thanks to the understated performances from the cast.""Now is Good"" is exactly what you expect from its premise, but sometimes you will be surprised at the reality it brings in. The story goes where it goes, and we know from the beginning where it is going, but it is told with sincerity, and the emotional impact is genuine.",4,"Familiar Story; Still, Emotional Impact Is Genuine",1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,1749,"['young', 'woman', 'man', 'course', 'dying', 'disease', 'subject', 'matter', 'been', 'many', 'years', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'seen', 'such', 'films', 'Life', 'Me', 'starring', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Theory', 'Flight', 'starring', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'more', 'recently', 'Restless', 'starring', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'three', 'films', 'varied', 'degrees', 'success', 'benefit', 'strong', 'acting', 'leading', 'player', 'now', 'film', 'UK', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'terminally', 'ill', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Tessa', 'Scott', 'who', 'love', 'shy', 'kind-hearted', 'neighbor', 'Adam', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', '.As', 'said', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'Based', 'novel', 'Die', 'Jenny', 'Downham', 'Now', 'Good', '16-year-old', 'girl', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'who', 'list', 'what', 'do', 'dying', 'kind', 'story', 'expect', 'film', 'will', 'become', 'sentimental', 'Yes', 'times', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'so.Written', 'directed', 'confidence', 'sensitivity', 'Ol', 'Parker', 'writer/director', 'Imagine', 'Me', 'better', 'known', 'work', 'screenwriter', 'Best', 'Exotic', 'Marigold', 'Hotel', 'Now', 'Good', 'goods', 'several', 'truly', 'moving', 'scenes', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'star', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Horse', 'are', 'fantastic', 'equally', 'great', 'are', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Tessa', 'protective', 'father', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'estranged', 'mother', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'ultimately', 'likable', 'thanks', 'understated', 'performances', 'cast', 'Now', 'Good', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'premise', 'sometimes', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'reality', 'story', 'where', 'know', 'beginning', 'where', 'going', 'told', 'sincerity', 'emotional', 'impact', 'genuine']",N/A

I've recently watchedSteven Spielberg Presents Takenwhere she was starring over 10 years ago. Now, after seeing this emotional and tragic film, ""Now is Good,"" her acting is just phenomenal and breath-taking.Personally, I have not read Jenny Downham's ""Before I Die"" to which this film adapted from. It's basically a story about Tessa Scott (played by Fanning) whose death is imminent of leukemia and who is trying to enjoy whatever left of her precious young life as much as she possibly can. With the help of her best friend Zoey, Tessa came up with the list of things that she wanted to do before she dies. Some of the things in the list contained pretty risky actions that even her father obviously doesn't approve of. This film is also about the family issues where the little brother often speak his mind without any inhibition to his sister, the father finding himself strongly opposing to Tessa's careless behaviors, and the mother whose absent in her daughter's life reveals her struggles with the diagnosis and trying to cope by ""escaping."" Additionally, Tessa found Adam, a next-door neighbor, who she found love and intimacy. The film basically shows Tessa's last few months of her life, in a very real way, and finally her death.Needless to say, this film is very emotional and quite realistically majestic.
