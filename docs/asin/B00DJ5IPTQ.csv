1655814,A36INLW8OL3A73,B00DJ5IPTQ,"D. Aiken ""social observer""","[1, 5]","Ten years ago,7-year-old Yogi Hanada commited an unpardonable sin; he struck his mother and caused her injury. As the story unfolds,in the later part of this series,it isn't as clear as perhaps it should be what all that transpired but whatever it was it seemed his mother was more than just upset with her husband leaving,perhaps she was suffering from mental disorder,what little time spent on her displayed emotionality hints at possible schizophrenia. Yogi,unable to deal with the two opposite demands of his mother regarding his sister,Kobato,(ie;&#34;Love you sister-Hate your sister,&#34;) fugues (mentally withdraws from reality) and &#34;creates&#34; several other &#34;personalities&#34;,their individual personalities all based on characters in his favorite video game,one that has the kigdom of Gretaguard as the center. For you psych-types,you already should know that this is Dissociative Identity Disorder (300.14) and not what the series calls,&#34;Multiple Personality Disorder&#34; as there is great double such really exists. But,for the limited intellictual depth of this series,it really isn't that important what it is called.The players of this well-drawn,reasonably paced and more than interesting series are the several &#34;personalities&#34;, the most prominate being the &#34;daytime&#34; and central alternate personality,the 17-year-old whimpy student,Takashi Haneda.He has a girlfriend named Asuka Watarai who is exceptionally attractive,fiesty and with a rich,dynamic personality: she deserves her own series.In fact,the girls carry this whole series. The females are the ones that are carrying the emotional loads of all the males,none of whom appear to be particuarly emotionally stable nor strong. The girls are also unusually attractive,all with strong personalities....until we get to Alice,who is the reason a 4+ quality series cannot be given more than a 3,if that.Alice is the 6 to 8 year old blonde daughter of a foreign businessman recently transfered to Japan. She hangs out in the late evening with a &#34;black dude&#34; named Marinez, &#34;why&#34;, I cannot even guess, and has not correctly learned the street lingo. In resonse to a comment by Drac that should never been made in the first place concerning her panties,Alice flips her skirt up and fights to hold the hem up while explaining she wears lacey and see-through panties; the artists make sure the viewer sees she is not only is not lying but that she is indeed a girl,front and back. This happens twice, she mentions something about strip-rock-paper-scissors,mentions ,&#34;...Drac is not happy down there...&#34;, and sits on an electric pelvic thruster at a spa.This is a nod to a thankfully microscopic group of sickos,is completely inexcusable and distructive of an otherwise delightful series;can homoerotica be far behind? Those sorry sickos do not bring in anywhere near the monies and fans that they cost.When Alice takes Ai's bra pads at the pool and puts them in her own bathing suit,that is what a girl her age,and older,would do and is entertaining.Her being naked in a spa is also normal but not really neccessary.If there is to be a Season 2,Alice must either be cleaned up or eliminated.",3,We Without Wings...and decent limits.,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,3211,"['Ten', 'years', 'ago,7-year-old', 'Yogi', 'Hanada', 'commited', 'unpardonable', 'sin', 'struck', 'mother', 'caused', 'injury', 'story', 'unfolds', 'later', 'part', 'series', ""n't"", 'as', 'clear', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'what', 'transpired', 'whatever', 'was', 'seemed', 'mother', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'upset', 'husband', 'leaving', 'perhaps', 'was', 'suffering', 'mental', 'disorder', 'what', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'displayed', 'emotionality', 'hints', 'possible', 'schizophrenia', 'Yogi', 'unable', 'deal', 'two', 'opposite', 'demands', 'mother', 'regarding', 'sister', 'Kobato', 'ie', '34', 'Love', 'sister-Hate', 'sister', '34', 'fugues', 'mentally', 'withdraws', 'reality', '34', 'creates', '34', 'several', 'other', '34', 'personalities', '34', 'individual', 'personalities', 'based', 'characters', 'favorite', 'video', 'game', 'one', 'kigdom', 'Gretaguard', 'center', 'psych-types', 'already', 'should', 'know', 'Dissociative', 'Identity', 'Disorder', '300.14', 'not', 'what', 'series', '34', 'Multiple', 'Personality', 'Disorder', '34', 'great', 'double', 'such', 'really', 'limited', 'intellictual', 'depth', 'series', 'really', ""n't"", 'important', 'what', 'called.The', 'players', 'well-drawn', 'reasonably', 'paced', 'more', 'interesting', 'series', 'are', 'several', '34', 'personalities', '34', 'most', 'prominate', 'being', '34', 'daytime', '34', 'central', 'alternate', 'personality', '17-year-old', 'whimpy', 'student', 'Takashi', 'Haneda.He', 'girlfriend', 'named', 'Asuka', 'Watarai', 'who', 'exceptionally', 'attractive', 'fiesty', 'rich', 'dynamic', 'personality', 'own', 'series.In', 'fact', 'girls', 'carry', 'whole', 'series', 'females', 'are', 'ones', 'are', 'carrying', 'emotional', 'loads', 'males', 'none', 'whom', 'appear', 'be', 'particuarly', 'emotionally', 'stable', 'strong', 'girls', 'are', 'also', 'unusually', 'attractive', 'strong', 'personalities', '.until', 'get', 'Alice', 'who', 'reason', '4+', 'quality', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'more', '3', 'that.Alice', '6', '8', 'year', 'old', 'blonde', 'daughter', 'foreign', 'businessman', 'recently', 'transfered', 'Japan', 'out', 'late', 'evening', '34', 'black', 'dude', '34', 'named', 'Marinez', '34', 'why', '34', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'guess', 'not', 'correctly', 'learned', 'street', 'lingo', 'resonse', 'comment', 'Drac', 'should', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'first', 'place', 'concerning', 'panties', 'Alice', 'skirt', 'up', 'fights', 'hold', 'hem', 'up', 'explaining', 'lacey', 'see-through', 'panties', 'artists', 'make', 'sure', 'viewer', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'lying', 'indeed', 'girl', 'front', 'back', 'twice', 'something', 'strip-rock-paper-scissors', 'mentions', '34', 'Drac', 'not', 'happy', '34', 'sits', 'electric', 'pelvic', 'thruster', 'spa.This', 'nod', 'thankfully', 'microscopic', 'group', 'sickos', 'completely', 'inexcusable', 'distructive', 'otherwise', 'delightful', 'series', 'can', 'homoerotica', 'be', 'far', 'sorry', 'sickos', 'do', 'not', 'bring', 'anywhere', 'monies', 'fans', 'cost.When', 'Alice', 'Ai', 'bra', 'pads', 'pool', 'own', 'bathing', 'suit', 'what', 'girl', 'age', 'older', 'would', 'do', 'entertaining.Her', 'being', 'naked', 'spa', 'also', 'normal', 'not', 'really', 'neccessary.If', 'be', 'Season', '2', 'Alice', 'must', 'either', 'be', 'cleaned', 'up', 'eliminated']",We Without Wings: Season 1

I can't say much more than that. As for the fanservice, the girls literally have no point in the series, but you end up liking them anyway. Also, episode 4 and 7 help explain what the scene hopping is all about. I suggest watching it online first. It's kind of confusing, but one of my favorites nevertheless!EDIT: When I reviewed this anime the first time not that long ago, it only said that it was blu-ray. Now that I see that this is blu-ray AND dvd...

1655816,A3BR26ITFVPYTC,B00DJ5IPTQ,jerbearmy,"[13, 16]","First off, if you love harems, bare boobs, panty-shots and the like, this show has plenty of all.  Watch it.  For the rest...We Without Wings is an anime adaptation of an H-game by Navel.  Personally, I'm not a much of a fan of harems and I'm less of a fan of H-games, but I watched this series because I enjoyed the anime adaptation of Navel's ""Shuffle!"" SeeShuffle: Complete Box Set S.A.V.E..  In Shuffle! each of the girls has a dark and interesting backstory.  In Wings, the girls don't seem to have any backstory at all, but the main character is pretty interesting.  The first three episodes of Wings are nothing but really over-the-top fanservice.  But starting at episode 4, you begin to get a glimpse into the true story.From a philosophical point of view, Wings is a commentary on escapism.  It's hard to say much in a review without saying most of what's actually done in the show, but let me just say that I thought that the TV channel-changing was a well thought-out symbol.Overall, I was disappointed by the show.  It does have a couple of pretty interesting ideas, but it doesn't really take the time to develop any of them.  Instead, it spends it's time cramming in more ecchi...  I will say that Wings is more than a typical harem, but it's nothing near the level of Shuffle!",3,Review for Harem non-lovers,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,1292,"['First', 'off', 'love', 'harems', 'bare', 'boobs', 'panty-shots', 'like', 'show', 'plenty', 'Watch', 'rest', 'Without', 'Wings', 'anime', 'adaptation', 'H-game', 'Navel', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'fan', 'harems', ""'m"", 'less', 'fan', 'H-games', 'watched', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'anime', 'adaptation', 'Navel', 'Shuffle', 'SeeShuffle', 'Complete', 'Box', 'Set', 'S.A.V.E..', 'Shuffle', 'girls', 'dark', 'interesting', 'backstory', 'Wings', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'backstory', 'main', 'character', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'Wings', 'are', 'nothing', 'really', 'over-the-top', 'fanservice', 'starting', 'episode', '4', 'begin', 'get', 'glimpse', 'true', 'story.From', 'philosophical', 'point', 'view', 'Wings', 'commentary', 'escapism', 'hard', 'say', 'much', 'review', 'saying', 'most', 'what', 'actually', 'done', 'show', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'thought', 'TV', 'channel-changing', 'was', 'well', 'thought-out', 'symbol.Overall', 'was', 'disappointed', 'show', 'have', 'couple', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'ideas', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'time', 'develop', 'Instead', 'time', 'cramming', 'more', 'ecchi', 'will', 'say', 'Wings', 'more', 'typical', 'harem', 'nothing', 'level', 'Shuffle']",We Without Wings: Season 1
1655817,A195PLFQV0UARO,B00DJ5IPTQ,Solace,"[3, 4]","Imagine you work at an anime studio.  You have 4 or 5 different shows in development and you run out of money.  We without wings is an attempt to cobble together these shows into one.  The series feels disjointed and characters come and go so fast you don't develop a real attachment to them.  The animation is well done, and the series does actually come together by the end so it &#34;makes sense.&#34;The &#34;writers&#34; think that people are obsessed with &#34;panty shots&#34; apparently as there are quite a few of them.  The fan service is pretty random and feels out of place.  It's used in some series for humor, not here.  Most disturbingly is Alice, the little girl, who flashes you.  It was disturbing and I don't know how they get away with it.The last episode was the typical &#34;trip to the hot springs.&#34;  A few participants were a couple of &#34;13&#34; year old girls.
