310397,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302390362,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","1964's KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, once a political fable, seems less so today. It's still very much a mild-mannered battle of the sexes, a vehicle that Tracy and Hepburn would've had a field day with. Leslie Harrison McCloud (Polly Bergen) - ex-judge, ambassador's daughter, senator's niece - has all the tools in the shed to carve a bright future in Washington, D.C. When a successful campaign has her elected as the U.S. President, her affable husband, Thaddeus (Fred MacMurray), sells his business so he could better serve as the White House's First Gentleman.Polly Bergen is very good and believable as our Commander-in-Chief. She demonstrates firm command in scenes when she's fulfilling her presidential obligations, but then loosens up in those private moments with her husband. Unfortunately, those private moments come few and far between and don't ever last very long. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, for the most part, concerns Thad McCloud's harsh acclimation to his new role. It's a comic study on the trivialization of a man.Did you know that Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel was modeled after Fred MacMurray? His face, anyway. In this movie, MacMurray starts out less the superhero, more the milquetoast. How out of sorts must he have been, relegated as the man behind the woman, hamstrung from voicing his political opinions? As the First Gentleman, he merits an office (dainty), two secretaries (old), and certain tasks (emasculating) expected of his post. One of these tasks becomes a send-up of Jacqueline Kennedy's famous televised White House tour.Another is fairly crucial to the plot. When odious dictator of a third world country, President Raphael Valdez (a cartoonish Eli Wallach), calls on the White House to demand a fiscal loan, the U.S. President's delaying tactic has her assigning her husband to escort him around D.C. I'm not saying that this is an awful idea...Thad is accused by an adversarial senator of incompetence, of sabotaging foreign relations, of sullying the presidential office. Good for Thad, he gets a shot at redemption at the senate hearing. But there's also tension from the matrimonial front. His wife being so preoccupied all the time, Thad has taken to spending (platonic) time with an old flame (Arlene Dahl). She's been cozying up to him, she who runs an empire of man's cologne. She extends him a business proposition that he mulls over, and you The viewer are left talking to the screen. ""You silly dupe!"" I heard you say.One more sub-plot, and it's an interesting one. It's to do with the McCloud children and how they start to act up. The elementary-grade son (Ronnie Dapo) starts bullying his classmates and even his teacher because he thinks his Secret Service bodyguards will back him up. The teenaged daughter (Anna Capri) and her boyfriend are all the time getting pulled over for speeding and she's been pulling the ""My mom's the President"" card to get out of tickets. The resolution is pretty mundane. That these kids act up the way they do makes for a fairly fascinating exercise in psychology. It certainly lends depth and dramatic content to the narrative.The timing of the theatrical premiere sucked so bad. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT bombed, and maybe it shouldn't have had. It certainly presents a plentitude of amusing moments and the two leads work well in concert. But the subject matter was a touchy thing in 1964, what with Kennedy's assassination having taken place only less than a year before. An American nation, perturbed and knackered still, probably didn't have it in it to chuckle along. It's almost as bad form as that old joke: ""So how'd you like the play, Mrs. Lincoln?"" 3.5 out of 5 stars. I took half a star off because of the very disappointing sell-out ending.",4,"""Man needs an office, especially if he has nothing to do.""",1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,3738,"['1964', 'KISSES', 'FOR', 'MY', 'PRESIDENT', 'once', 'political', 'fable', 'less', 'so', 'today', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'mild-mannered', 'battle', 'sexes', 'vehicle', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'field', 'day', 'Leslie', 'Harrison', 'McCloud', 'Polly', 'Bergen', 'ex-judge', 'ambassador', 'daughter', 'senator', 'niece', 'tools', 'shed', 'carve', 'bright', 'future', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'When', 'successful', 'campaign', 'elected', 'U.S.', 'President', 'affable', 'husband', 'Thaddeus', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'business', 'could', 'better', 'serve', 'White', 'House', 'First', 'Gentleman.Polly', 'Bergen', 'very', 'good', 'believable', 'Commander-in-Chief', 'firm', 'command', 'scenes', 'when', 'fulfilling', 'presidential', 'obligations', 'then', 'up', 'private', 'moments', 'husband', 'Unfortunately', 'private', 'moments', 'come', 'few', 'far', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'last', 'very', 'long', 'KISSES', 'FOR', 'MY', 'PRESIDENT', 'most', 'part', 'concerns', 'Thad', 'McCloud', 'harsh', 'acclimation', 'new', 'role', 'comic', 'study', 'trivialization', 'man.Did', 'know', 'Fawcett', 'Comics', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'was', 'modeled', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'face', 'anyway', 'movie', 'MacMurray', 'out', 'less', 'superhero', 'more', 'milquetoast', 'How', 'sorts', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'relegated', 'man', 'woman', 'hamstrung', 'voicing', 'political', 'opinions', 'First', 'Gentleman', 'office', 'dainty', 'two', 'secretaries', 'old', 'certain', 'tasks', 'emasculating', 'expected', 'post', 'One', 'tasks', 'send-up', 'Jacqueline', 'Kennedy', 'famous', 'televised', 'White', 'House', 'tour.Another', 'fairly', 'crucial', 'plot', 'When', 'odious', 'dictator', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'President', 'Raphael', 'Valdez', 'cartoonish', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'White', 'House', 'demand', 'fiscal', 'loan', 'U.S.', 'President', 'delaying', 'tactic', 'assigning', 'husband', 'escort', 'around', 'D.C', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'awful', 'idea', 'Thad', 'accused', 'adversarial', 'senator', 'incompetence', 'sabotaging', 'foreign', 'relations', 'sullying', 'presidential', 'office', 'Good', 'Thad', 'shot', 'redemption', 'senate', 'hearing', 'also', 'tension', 'matrimonial', 'front', 'wife', 'being', 'so', 'preoccupied', 'time', 'Thad', 'taken', 'spending', 'platonic', 'time', 'old', 'flame', 'Arlene', 'Dahl', 'been', 'cozying', 'up', 'who', 'empire', 'man', 'cologne', 'business', 'proposition', 'viewer', 'are', 'left', 'talking', 'screen', 'silly', 'dupe', 'heard', 'say.One', 'more', 'sub-plot', 'interesting', 'one', 'do', 'McCloud', 'children', 'how', 'start', 'act', 'up', 'elementary-grade', 'son', 'Ronnie', 'Dapo', 'bullying', 'classmates', 'even', 'teacher', 'Secret', 'Service', 'bodyguards', 'will', 'back', 'up', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Capri', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'time', 'getting', 'pulled', 'over', 'speeding', 'been', 'pulling', 'My', 'mom', 'President', 'card', 'get', 'tickets', 'resolution', 'pretty', 'mundane', 'kids', 'act', 'up', 'way', 'do', 'fairly', 'fascinating', 'exercise', 'psychology', 'certainly', 'depth', 'dramatic', 'content', 'narrative.The', 'timing', 'theatrical', 'premiere', 'sucked', 'so', 'bad', 'KISSES', 'FOR', 'MY', 'PRESIDENT', 'bombed', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'certainly', 'plentitude', 'amusing', 'moments', 'two', 'leads', 'work', 'well', 'concert', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'touchy', 'thing', '1964', 'what', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'having', 'taken', 'place', 'only', 'less', 'year', 'before', 'American', 'nation', 'perturbed', 'knackered', 'still', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chuckle', 'along', 'almost', 'bad', 'form', 'old', 'joke', 'how', ""'d"", 'play', 'Mrs', 'Lincoln', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'took', 'star', 'very', 'disappointing', 'sell-out', 'ending']",Kisses for My President VHS

Of course, this owes to the fact that she is an awesome actor to begin with.Fred MacMurray gives an equally compelling role as the First Gentleman. Frankly, since he was playing a role which was actually disparaged when this film was made (the idea of a dominant wife/subservient husband was-then scandalous) he deserves additional kudos for having to 'climb uphill'. His character has to put-up with now-riddiculous ideas for anybody but he also comes through the screenplay like a champ.The sets are really well designed. The production department wanted viewers to feel as if they are in the White House during this film. The viewers are supposed to balance the-then absurdity of a woman president with the reality of the White House looking basically as it should.The only thing I hated about this movie (again owing to its datedness) was that the President resigns when she is pregnant. There is a somber announcement from the White House as if the president has died or committed a serious crime against the country.  I recognize this film was made when most American companies lacked maternity leave/had pregnancy discrimination, because a pregnancy is now not something we would expect a modern public official to resign for.",3,The president is pregnant!,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,1365,"['Most', 'scripting', 'movie', 'really', 'dated', 'Polly', 'Bergen', 'good', 'job', 'material', 'had', 'work', 'course', 'fact', 'awesome', 'actor', 'begin', 'with.Fred', 'MacMurray', 'equally', 'compelling', 'role', 'First', 'Gentleman', 'Frankly', 'was', 'playing', 'role', 'was', 'actually', 'disparaged', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'idea', 'dominant', 'wife/subservient', 'husband', 'was-then', 'scandalous', 'additional', 'kudos', 'having', ""'climb"", 'uphill', 'character', 'put-up', 'now-riddiculous', 'ideas', 'anybody', 'also', 'screenplay', 'champ.The', 'sets', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'designed', 'production', 'department', 'wanted', 'viewers', 'feel', 'are', 'White', 'House', 'film', 'viewers', 'are', 'supposed', 'balance', 'the-then', 'absurdity', 'woman', 'president', 'reality', 'White', 'House', 'looking', 'basically', 'only', 'thing', 'hated', 'movie', 'again', 'owing', 'datedness', 'was', 'President', 'resigns', 'when', 'pregnant', 'somber', 'announcement', 'White', 'House', 'president', 'died', 'committed', 'serious', 'crime', 'country', 'recognize', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'most', 'American', 'companies', 'lacked', 'maternity', 'leave/had', 'pregnancy', 'discrimination', 'pregnancy', 'now', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'expect', 'modern', 'public', 'official', 'resign']",Kisses for My President VHS
