963979,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000DZIGEO,A Customer,"[5, 6]","Evelyn Ryan (Julianne Moore) is a plucky, optimistic homemaker living in the small town of Defiance, Ohio. It is the mid-nineteen fifties and for most women in Evelyn's situation life's fulfillments consists mainly of raising children whilst being a dutiful wife, and trying to keep her home together. But Evelyn also has something very special to offer; she's part of a subculture called contesting, where word-savvy American housewives entered the countless jingle and slogan contests advertisers used to promote their products.For Evelyn, however, this pastime isn't really about the fun, but more a way to obtain ready cash and merchandise to keep her working class family from going under. After all, Evelyn has six sons and four daughters to feed. Kelly, her husband (a marvelous Woody Harrelson) is an alcoholic. He truly loves his wife and kids but he is, for reasons that are explained in the movie, a crushed and disappointed man, who looks at Evelyn and sees a women who is much smarter than he is and who contains a ready supply of optimism and talent that he can only dream of.Kelly is employed as a machine worker, but he drinks much of his income away, and spends his evenings throwing noisy, sometimes violent tantrums that alarm Evelyn and scare the kids. But Evelyn seems to know how to handle him, letting him rage and bluster the anguish away. There are plenty of trying moments for her, not the least of which is her weekly go-rounds averting creditors like the milkman (Simon Reynolds).Evelyn soon realizes that as she can't take control of Kelly and the financial running of the household, so self-reliance is her only choice. This is 1956, and women's roles are heavily delineated, she doesn't drive, and she's not invited to sign the mortgage; in this world, Miss America contestants confidently proclaim that women are too high-strung and emotional to hold national office, the irony of this remark being painfully obvious.Evelyn has the patience of a saint and cleverly doesn't coddle her deprived husband, but she has limitless empathy for her embittered husband's fall from grace into the ""ranks of ordinary men."" Through all the hardships, the drunken rages, the needy children and the disappointments of never being able to treat herself to at least something, Evelyn is persistently cheerful and capable, running her household efficiently on pennies a day while managing to dole out acceptable proportions of attention and affection to each of her kids.The performance is an absolute showpiece for the wonderful Julianne Moore, and she nails Evelyn's mixture of feisty resilience and quick-witted intelligence in the face of certain disaster and poverty. And while the movie has a tendency to be a trifle Hollywoodized - there's no way that Evelyn would be that thin and glamorous after giving birth to ten kids! - there's a real effort on the part of the writers to brings to life something deeper and wiser, something almost subversive in her character's refusal to be damaged by life's hardships.Watching Evelyn, a woman of such fierce intelligence who could today perhaps be a hotshot career journalist working for a national newspaper, grin and bear it isn't exactly fun and at times is down right maddening, especially when she's dealing with her babyish, useless husband. But Moore puts across Evelyn's philosophy of forgiveness in the name of love and happiness with such a fierce and focused conviction, that one can't help being flawed by another terrific performance from this truly great actress.

963980,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000DZIGEO,Alistair McHarg,"[6, 13]","If you want to see Julianne Moore at the top of her game get Far From Heaven, a film where creative vision brings make-believe characters to life.  While Moore is excellent in The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio, ultimately she is defeated by the emotionally manipulative ""true"" story and ham-fisted directing of first-timer Jane Anderson.Moore Plays Evelyn Ryan, a housewife with an ear for language who supplements her family's income by entering jingle contests.  Her flair with words is significant because the family is always broke.  Amazingly, only the milkman seems to be familiar with the concept of ""living within your means.""  Her husband quite literally drinks up the rent money, but she stays with him anyway, tolerating abuse of all types, and breeding like there's no tomorrow.  Indeed, it is Evelyn's determination to single-handedly overpopulate the world, despite her self-inflicted poverty, that plays the biggest role in making her unsympathetic.Defiance is based on a memoir by Terry Ryan, one of Evelyn's real-life daughters who came to town with an agenda.  She wants us to think about - what would have happened if Evelyn had been allowed to freely express her talent?  What price did Evelyn pay for tiptoeing around and enabling an alcoholic husband?  In case we're not clever enough to answer these questions ourselves, she points us straight to the culprit - the 1950s.  Even the least attentive viewer will ""get it"" when s/he watches Bert Parks and Miss America discuss why women are simply incapable of being President.These sins are egregious, and Ms. Anderson compounds them with many scenes where Evelyn speaks directly to the camera, (a cheap, lazy expository technique.)  Worse still are the MTV-esque montages of advertising art, to say nothing of the other ""contesters.""  One of these women makes regular appearances in an iron lung; an absurdist touch so macabre that it looks like it's been imported from another movie.Instead of feeling inspired by the grit and determination of Evelyn as she writes idiotic rhymes to promote awful products, we are left with a sense of sorrow that a person with such admirable qualities would be forced to squander them by social forces beyond her control.",3,"Less Acquiescence, More Defiance",1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,2228,"['want', 'see', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'top', 'game', 'get', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'film', 'where', 'creative', 'vision', 'make-believe', 'characters', 'life', 'Moore', 'excellent', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'ultimately', 'defeated', 'emotionally', 'manipulative', 'true', 'story', 'ham-fisted', 'directing', 'first-timer', 'Jane', 'Anderson.Moore', 'Plays', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'housewife', 'ear', 'language', 'who', 'family', 'income', 'entering', 'jingle', 'contests', 'flair', 'words', 'significant', 'family', 'always', 'broke', 'Amazingly', 'only', 'milkman', 'be', 'familiar', 'concept', 'living', 'means', 'husband', 'quite', 'literally', 'up', 'rent', 'money', 'anyway', 'tolerating', 'abuse', 'types', 'breeding', 'tomorrow', 'Indeed', 'Evelyn', 'determination', 'single-handedly', 'overpopulate', 'world', 'self-inflicted', 'poverty', 'biggest', 'role', 'making', 'unsympathetic.Defiance', 'based', 'memoir', 'Terry', 'Ryan', 'one', 'Evelyn', 'real-life', 'daughters', 'who', 'came', 'town', 'agenda', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Evelyn', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'freely', 'express', 'talent', 'What', 'price', 'did', 'Evelyn', 'pay', 'tiptoeing', 'around', 'enabling', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'case', ""'re"", 'not', 'clever', 'enough', 'answer', 'questions', 'ourselves', 'straight', 'culprit', '1950s', 'Even', 'least', 'attentive', 'viewer', 'will', 'get', 'when', 's/he', 'watches', 'Bert', 'Parks', 'Miss', 'America', 'why', 'women', 'are', 'simply', 'incapable', 'being', 'President.These', 'sins', 'are', 'egregious', 'Ms.', 'Anderson', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'Evelyn', 'directly', 'camera', 'cheap', 'lazy', 'expository', 'technique', 'Worse', 'still', 'are', 'MTV-esque', 'montages', 'advertising', 'art', 'say', 'nothing', 'other', 'contesters', 'One', 'women', 'regular', 'appearances', 'iron', 'lung', 'absurdist', 'touch', 'macabre', 'been', 'imported', 'movie.Instead', 'feeling', 'inspired', 'grit', 'determination', 'Evelyn', 'idiotic', 'rhymes', 'promote', 'awful', 'products', 'are', 'left', 'sense', 'sorrow', 'person', 'such', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'would', 'be', 'forced', 'squander', 'social', 'forces', 'control']",N/A

True, the dad is an alcoholic and has no respect for God's Holy name; but when taken in the context of the day, the mute button works quite nicely.  In the 1950's - when this film is set - people must understand that Alcoholism did not &#34;exist&#34; as an understood disease.  As such, it was accepted as just &#34;one of those things&#34;.  Also, women were confined again to their homes and the raising of their children.  Not necessarily a bad state of life, but one that prohibited any wage earning outside of the home as far as society was concerned.  So when Evelyn uses her God-given talents for contesting to help keep her family financially afloat, those in her society saw it as wrong and thought she was neglecting her family.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  And the courage, faith, wit, and LOVE that Evelyn has for her family and her neighbors is nothing short of saintly!  I LOVE this film, and I highly recommend it for any parent who feels they're doing it wrong.

She has such a clever and intelligent grasp of the material that Moore seems born to play this woman, until you think of all her previous incarnations so completely unlike this character.Her stoic good cheer in coping with a bunch of children, an angry and bitter husband prone to violent outbursts (nicely played by Woody Harrelson), ever present cash shortages and so on, goes beyond optimism but in fact reveals a steely will and determination to find the good, no matter what set-backs life deals her. It is a marvelous tribute to the fortitude of the real woman it is modeled on.Directed with flair by Jane Anderson who does some nice work spicing up the presentation with some witty bits of business.  Anderson handles the domestic tribulations nicely, and makes some sly references concerning the social restrictions and impositions on the women of the day, boundaries and limits that would be unthinkable today, but were the norm back in the oh-so-romanticized 50's and early 60's.  And yet these women carried on with wit and courage and raised decent children and lived lives of merit and worth.Nicely done in all departments, this was another very good film that sort of slipped through the cracks.

While Father drank away his meager earnings , Mother entered contests , which were common in those days , but because of her determination and sheer NEED , she won LOTS of contests over the years while her children (10 of them) were growing up.BESIDES the story , there are bits and pieces of ""comercials"" of that day , and different snappy propaganda to keep us amused.If you are old enough , they will bring back so many fond memories , if you are younger , you will still enjoy these ""pop up"" songs and dance.This movie is a mixture of so many things: A Mothers love , a Fathers alcoholism , a sometimes sad , sometimes happy family, in short , all the ups and downs of a dysfunctional family, We see the Father at his worst , although he did have a couple good points when he was sober , which I gathered was not too often.The kids, Woody Harrelson , and Julliane Moore are TERRIFIC , and another added treat is , we get to meet the REAL Ryan kids , (as adults of course) at the ending.The most touching part to me , WAS at the ending , the Daughter ""Tuff"" is sitting on the steps of the house , holding her dead Mother's typewriter , and Julliane Moore , (Who of course, played Evelyn) kisses her on the cheek.

This is a fairly faithful adaptation of Terry Ryan's memoir - both my wife and I have read and enjoyed the book.  Ms. Moore portrays Evelyn Ryan, a strong and intelligent ""housewife"" of the 1950's and mother of ten, who uses her writing talents to win contests, literally keeping her family together and the wolf from the door.  As presented in the book, her timing in winning prizes of cash, cars and appliances was uncannily timely.  Woody Harrelson does a fine job, too, portraying her alcoholic and explosive husband, Kelly.  Laura Dern appears also in a small role as Evelyn's contesting friend Dortha.  And the supporting cast of kids are great, too, especially the young actress who portrays daughter ""Tuff"" (who grew to be the author of the book).  I have only minor quibbles with the film. First, I found the ""fourth-wall"" effect of Ms. Moore talking to the audience with her own character in the same scene a little surreal (I would have thought having ""Tuff"" as the narrator would have been a better, though conventional, choice); and as expected, some liberties are taken with the book.  For instance, in the scene where Kelly ends up with a bowl of Jello mold all over him, I believe it was accidental in the book, while in the film it's quite intentional.  While one can understand Evelyn's rage, her character would have never wasted food that way. Otherwise, though, the film does a good job in depicting a housewife's plight in those days, from financial (her husband being the sole signer of the house they purchased with her cash prize), to domestic abuse (the attitude that she just had to put up with an abusive, alcoholic husband, even the implication by a priest that it was her fault).  Ms. Moore, as usual, is luminous in the role, and lifts the whole film above the level of an average big-family drama.  Other than some occasional profanity from Mr. Ryan, it's a family-friendly film.",4,One of Julianne Moore's Best Performances,1142640000,"03 18, 2006",2006,2015,"['Add', 'list', 'fans', 'who', 'think', 'wonderful', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'film', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Terry', 'Ryan', 'memoir', 'wife', 'have', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'housewife', '1950', 'mother', 'ten', 'who', 'writing', 'talents', 'win', 'contests', 'literally', 'keeping', 'family', 'together', 'wolf', 'door', 'presented', 'book', 'timing', 'winning', 'prizes', 'cash', 'cars', 'appliances', 'was', 'uncannily', 'timely', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'fine', 'job', 'too', 'portraying', 'alcoholic', 'explosive', 'husband', 'Kelly', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'also', 'small', 'role', 'Evelyn', 'contesting', 'friend', 'Dortha', 'supporting', 'cast', 'kids', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'especially', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'daughter', 'Tuff', 'who', 'grew', 'be', 'author', 'book', 'have', 'only', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'film', 'First', 'found', 'fourth-wall', 'effect', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'talking', 'audience', 'own', 'character', 'same', 'scene', 'little', 'surreal', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'having', 'Tuff', 'narrator', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'conventional', 'choice', 'expected', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'book', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'Kelly', 'up', 'bowl', 'Jello', 'mold', 'believe', 'was', 'accidental', 'book', 'film', 'quite', 'intentional', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'Evelyn', 'rage', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'wasted', 'food', 'way', 'Otherwise', 'though', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'housewife', 'plight', 'days', 'financial', 'husband', 'being', 'sole', 'signer', 'house', 'purchased', 'cash', 'prize', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'attitude', 'just', 'had', 'put', 'up', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'even', 'implication', 'priest', 'was', 'fault', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'usual', 'luminous', 'role', 'whole', 'film', 'level', 'average', 'big-family', 'drama', 'Other', 'occasional', 'profanity', 'Mr.', 'Ryan', 'family-friendly', 'film']",N/A

963989,A2LN2AK7HNBI8N,B000DZIGEO,Bruce Varner,"[8, 9]","Wow....what an amazing story this is.  I think it is touching and beautiful that one of the daughters of this remarkable woman would tell her story.  It's a story we all need to hear.Evelyn Ryan is a housewife in the mid-1950's who has a talent for writing jingles and tag lines.  She has an alcoholic husband who flys into drunken rages.  In addition to his rages, which cause property damage and physical harm to her, he spends his meager paychecks on booze.  Evelyn is trying to raise 10 children, and most of the time she can't even afford milk.  Amazingly, she is able to do it by winning prizes in writing contests.  Even so, it seems like she can't get a break.  Every time something good happens, it is either followed by something bad or an upcoming good event gets ruined and/or pre-empted by something bad.  She finally does manage to get out of town, and we realize that, since she has been married, she has NEVER eaten out not stayed in a hotel.  She bears her burdens with grace and charm.  She is a lesson to us all.This movie is so incredibly valuable.  It shows us a picture of bygone days, days gone forever, days we can learn a lesson from.  To cope with her difficulties, Evelyn didn't have affairs or pop Prozac.  She didn't divorce her husband.  Every challenge in her life was met by determination and a smile.  The movie shows the end of the contest era, with the arrival of sweepstakes.  No longer would talent or literacy be required to win money.  In short, this movie shows us a remarkable woman, stronger than most of us could ever hope to be.Strong performances bring this film to life.  Julianne Moore is a completely believable Evelyn.  In dealing with all of her challenges, Moore could have played this character as either too strong or too oblivious.  Moore's characterization gives us a woman who is very aware of her suffering, she just doesn't see the use complaining about her plights.  Woody Harrelson does an incredible turn as her alcoholic husband.  Harrelson has correctly identified and internalized the motivation behind Kelly Ryan's rage...he is jealous of his wife's success, afraid of her leaving him, and disgusted at his own state.  These are quite powerful performances from these actors, but hardly unexpected. The pleasant surprise in this film came from a high school actress named Ellary Porterfield.  The young Ms. Porterfield plays ""Tuff"" Ryan, one of the daughters and the author of the book upon which this movie is based.  Ms. Porterfield showed tremendous range, sensitivity, and insight.  I hope to see more from this young actress.Highly recommended.",5,"Sometimes Tough, Always Inspirational",1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2614,"['Wow', '.what', 'amazing', 'story', 'think', 'touching', 'beautiful', 'one', 'daughters', 'remarkable', 'woman', 'would', 'tell', 'story', 'story', 'need', 'hear.Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'housewife', 'mid-1950', 'who', 'talent', 'writing', 'jingles', 'tag', 'lines', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'who', 'flys', 'drunken', 'rages', 'addition', 'rages', 'cause', 'property', 'damage', 'physical', 'harm', 'meager', 'paychecks', 'booze', 'Evelyn', 'trying', 'raise', '10', 'children', 'most', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'afford', 'milk', 'Amazingly', 'able', 'do', 'winning', 'prizes', 'writing', 'contests', 'Even', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'break', 'time', 'something', 'good', 'happens', 'followed', 'something', 'bad', 'upcoming', 'good', 'event', 'ruined', 'pre-empted', 'something', 'bad', 'finally', 'manage', 'get', 'town', 'realize', 'been', 'married', 'NEVER', 'eaten', 'out', 'not', 'stayed', 'hotel', 'burdens', 'grace', 'charm', 'lesson', 'all.This', 'movie', 'so', 'incredibly', 'valuable', 'picture', 'bygone', 'days', 'days', 'gone', 'forever', 'days', 'can', 'learn', 'lesson', 'cope', 'difficulties', 'Evelyn', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'affairs', 'pop', 'Prozac', 'did', ""n't"", 'divorce', 'husband', 'challenge', 'life', 'was', 'met', 'determination', 'smile', 'movie', 'end', 'contest', 'era', 'arrival', 'sweepstakes', 'No', 'longer', 'would', 'talent', 'literacy', 'be', 'required', 'win', 'money', 'short', 'movie', 'remarkable', 'woman', 'stronger', 'most', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'be.Strong', 'performances', 'bring', 'film', 'life', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'completely', 'believable', 'Evelyn', 'dealing', 'challenges', 'Moore', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'character', 'too', 'strong', 'too', 'oblivious', 'Moore', 'characterization', 'woman', 'who', 'very', 'aware', 'suffering', 'just', ""n't"", 'see', 'use', 'complaining', 'plights', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'incredible', 'turn', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'Harrelson', 'correctly', 'identified', 'internalized', 'motivation', 'Kelly', 'Ryan', 'rage', 'jealous', 'wife', 'success', 'afraid', 'leaving', 'disgusted', 'own', 'state', 'are', 'quite', 'powerful', 'performances', 'actors', 'hardly', 'unexpected', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'film', 'came', 'high', 'school', 'actress', 'named', 'Ellary', 'Porterfield', 'young', 'Ms.', 'Porterfield', 'Tuff', 'Ryan', 'one', 'daughters', 'author', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'Ms.', 'Porterfield', 'showed', 'tremendous', 'range', 'sensitivity', 'insight', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'young', 'actress.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
963990,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000DZIGEO,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[8, 10]","Corporate contests that involved creating advertising jingles were all the rage during the 1950's and early 1960's and they were part of the promotional campaigns of many companies, both large and small. The way they worked was simple: Contestants from all over the country were asked to submit an advertising jingle- typically in 25 words or less- that summed up the product in a clever and catchy way. Sometimes, the company would start the slogan and then ask consumers to complete the jingle. Other times, the entry would be completely original, with the consumer composing the entire jingle.""Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio"" is a movie based on a book by the same name. The book, written by Terry Ryan, is based on a true story about Evelyn Ryan and her amazing skill when it came to writing these advertising jingles. The family was constantly in dire financial straits, mainly because of the father's problem drinking, but also because the family was so big. And since Kelly Ryan was constantly broke, Evelyn felt a responsibility to her family to make ends meet. She had a gift for creative writing and she decided to use that gift to compose entries in these contests. She racked up many, many wins and on more than one occasion she saved her family from bankruptcy.This movie captures the heart warming spirit of the book very well and for those who have read the book (I am one of them), you will be pleased to know that what the movie depicts is almost dead- on with the book it is based on. You get to watch this conventional, optimistic housewife as she works her tail to the bone, taking care of her family and writing contest entries. You get to witness the volatile personality of Kelly Ryan and watch him blow up and get raving mad at one moment, only to act completely calm and loving at another. And you get to see how the kid's handle all of this chaos caused by their father along with the joy and happiness that followed one of mom's victories.Many things about this movie make it enjoyable, and the greatest among them is the joyful feeling when Evelyn Ryan gets another phone call or a visit from the postman notifying her that she has, once again, submitted the winning entry to a contest. Just when things seem down and life looks dismal, Evelyn comes through with a winning entry in the nick of time. Another thing that is interesting (and also a little unreal) is Evelyn's perpetual optimism. She has this huge family, her husband is an alcoholic, and there is barely money to put food on the table. But no matter how violent her husband gets or no matter how bleak the situation seems, she is still optimistic that life will get better. And life does get better in the end, with all ten of her kids enjoying different degrees of success. In fact, the film ends by talking about the real- life Ryans and what each of them has done in their adult lives. Evelyn Ryan deserves almost all the credit for making this happen, and the movie portrays her bright, happy demeanor in a convincing way, showing how her warm, loving personality led to the successes of her ten children.Julianne Moore has the character of Evelyn Ryan nailed down (at least from what I know about Evelyn Ryan, based on reading the book) and her joyous, nurturing, forgiving demeanor is compelling. It isn't something you find in very many people and it is amazing that she was able to keep her family together- and keep her own sanity- under these circumstances. Woody Harrelson plays Kelly Ryan and he also nails the part, showing the almost split personality of a man who seemed depressed one minute (his drinking brought his depressed side to the surface) and then happy and loving toward his family the next. He is also responsible for some of the film's more suspenseful moments. When he throws his fits, you're never quite sure what he might do. With the kids, only Allary Porterfield- the actress who plays Terry Ryan as a teenager- gets any real time in the spotlight. The other kids are there, but little is mentioned about them.One of the criticisms that have been leveled toward this movie is the thinness of the script. This is valid, to an extent, because there is very little analysis of the different family members. For example, we all know that Kelly Ryan had a drinking problem and we learn early in the movie that he was an aspiring singer who lost his dream when his vocal chords were damaged in a car accident. The viewer can witness his fits of rage but not much is stated about why he acted this way. One can only make a few guesses. It is obvious that he was depressed and that he became angry when drunk. It is also pointed out that he was a little resentful of his wife's contest success because the men at his workplace were constantly teasing him about it, making him feel inadequate as a provider. But the underlying reasons for his insecurities are never explored. He was likely very disappointed over the damage to his vocal chords- an event that probably changed his life forever. But he was also very upbeat on other occasions, leading me to wonder if maybe he was manic depressive. The same lack of cross- examination is true with all the other characters. We know that Evelyn Ryan was an upbeat, motherly type of gal but we don't get to learn much else about her. And daughter Terry Ryan is the only child who gets much coverage among the ten siblings.One other thing about this film that turned me off at first is the scenes at the beginning that show Julianne Moore talking directly to the camera. Having narration is ok, but in this instance director Jane Anderson decided to have Moore talk directly to the camera, like an announcer for a sporting event. I was able to tolerate this after a while and, fortunately, it doesn't continue for very long. But this is a pet peeve of mine with films. Unless I'm watching a documentary, I don't like to see characters talk to the camera; like they know a film is being made. It takes away from the fictionalization of the movie. I realize this is based on a true story, but I still don't like this type of directing unless I'm watching a non- fiction documentary.""The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio"" isn't the perfect film, even if it does have a happy ending. A little more depth and more investigation into the ""how"" and ""why"" of the characters would have made it more complete. But like the book, this movie is heartwarming and fascinating. It shows how the determination of one woman to make a better life for her family succeeded to the extreme, with contest wins that surpassed all odds and saved her family from financial devastation.",4,And the Winner is......Evelyn Ryan!!,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,6617,"['Corporate', 'contests', 'involved', 'creating', 'advertising', 'jingles', 'were', 'rage', '1950', 'early',

963992,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000DZIGEO,Craig Matteson,"[5, 6]","I knew nothing of the real life story behind the book when I began watching this movie.  It struck me as a very strange story and one so absolutely unique that I wondered what its possible purpose could be as a work of fiction.  While it captured some of what life was like in the 1950s, nearly all men were not mean-drunks (or drunks of any kind), nor had anyone I had ever known ever won a contest let alone try to make ends meet by winning them.  It seems like ridiculously long odds to do so.  While many working class families had to work to make ends meet on one income, and it was not unusual for women to not drive, they were definitely in the minority and almost extinct in the 1960s.Still, the story was quite engaging and the mother (marvelously portrayed by Julianne Moore) is the kind of anchor that did keep such families together even with less than ideal husbands (to be fair, there were many men who kept their families together with less than ideal husbands.  And in every marriage, both partners are actually less than ideal - just some more so than others.).  Evelyn Ryan was a real life woman and this story was written by her daughter, Terry.  The story seems a bit idealized, and the timing of the winnings seems a bit too convenient for reality, but the gestures and structure of the relationships do seem true and real.The father, Kelly, was an alcoholic that was a particularly mean drunk.  He hated his sense of impotence that came from providing so poorly for his wife and ten children and having to work as a laborer in a factory day after day, year after year.  His wife's talents were beyond him and he resented her brilliance.  Yet, he loved his children and his wife.  When he was sober, he did OK most of the time, but he was not good with the family finances and the fact that in that time it was usually the man's prerogative to run them only added to the family's burdens.Today, a woman as talented as Evelyn could do anything she wanted.  And while she might have wanted to raise ten children (there is certainly nothing wrong with a woman being as fine a mother as she was), she might also have wanted to run her own ad agency or marketing firm and she certainly could have done that, as well.The movie does have a fine heart and does a fine job of praising the mother without having to make the father into the villain.  He does screw up, a number of times, but in the end, well, you have to see the movie.

963994,AQ990HW13DP08,B000DZIGEO,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[10, 11]","Set in the post-war 1950s, director Jane Anderson portrays the life of Evelyn Ryan (Julianne Moore), a mother of ten who supported her family as a ""contester"" by winning an astounding number of prizes for her hundreds if not thousands of entries. Evelyn is an irrepressible mother, cheerful, dutiful, brilliant, and probably an enabler to her husband Kelly. Kelly (Woody Harrelson) is an insecure, self-loathing under-achiever whose alcoholism explodes into fits of rage and violence. But as was true for that era, he was the man of the house who called all the shots. When the cops arrive to quell their domestic violence, they chat with Kelly about baseball; when the priest comes over he advises Evelyn to be a better wife. If not for Evelyn's soothing, confident oil upon these troubled waters, the Ryan family and marriage would have both disintegrated. In an interesting technical twist Anderson has a double of Evelyn narrate parts of the film. Anderson based the film on the family memoir The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio: How My Mother Raised 10 Kids on 25 Words or Less by Terry Ryan (one of the ten children). As someone who was raised in a family of eight in the age of Father Knows Best, I loved this emotionally rich film about a mom who had no power but all the influence.",5,mother knows best,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1289,"['Set', 'post-war', '1950s', 'director', 'Jane', 'Anderson', 'life', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'mother', 'ten', 'who', 'supported', 'family', 'contester', 'winning', 'astounding', 'number', 'prizes', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'entries', 'Evelyn', 'irrepressible', 'mother', 'cheerful', 'dutiful', 'brilliant', 'probably', 'enabler', 'husband', 'Kelly', 'Kelly', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'insecure', 'self-loathing', 'under-achiever', 'alcoholism', 'fits', 'rage', 'violence', 'was', 'true', 'era', 'was', 'man', 'house', 'who', 'called', 'shots', 'When', 'cops', 'arrive', 'quell', 'domestic', 'violence', 'chat', 'Kelly', 'baseball', 'when', 'priest', 'Evelyn', 'be', 'better', 'wife', 'not', 'Evelyn', 'soothing', 'confident', 'oil', 'troubled', 'waters', 'Ryan', 'family', 'marriage', 'would', 'have', 'disintegrated', 'interesting', 'technical', 'twist', 'Anderson', 'double', 'Evelyn', 'narrate', 'parts', 'film', 'Anderson', 'based', 'film', 'family', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'How', 'Mother', 'Raised', '10', 'Kids', '25', 'Words', 'Less', 'Terry', 'Ryan', 'one', 'ten', 'children', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'family', 'eight', 'age', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'loved', 'emotionally', 'rich', 'film', 'mom', 'who', 'had', 'power', 'influence']",N/A
963995,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B000DZIGEO,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","I write my editorial tribute to this turbulent, warm-hearted nostalgia piece of Americana, which director Jane Anderson serves up like a slice of sweet apple pie on the 15th anniversary of the passing of its remarkable protagonist, played by Julianne Moore with as much cheerfulness and grit as Evelyn Ryan herself may have possessed.Her story is one in which H.T. Leslie's observation, ""The game of life is not so much  holding a good hand as playing a poor hand well."", receives a highly profound summation through the writings of her late daughter, Tuff.A one-time humor columnist for a newspaper in Sherwood, Ohio, Evelyn becomes enamored of a band singer, Leo ""Kelly"" Ryan(Woody Harrelson), who has a promising career, but after losing his singing voice in an auto accident, he takes a job as a machinist, and as he and his bride begin their lives together, is driven to drink. In what could be construed as co-dependency, Evelyn explains his behavior to the audience, stating that if he appears to be immature, selfish, or mean to remember that he lost his voice while she kept hers.Despite these problems, they proceed to parent 10 children, including Lea Anne( Monte Gagne), Bruce( Jake Scott, Trevor Morgan), Rog(Erik Knusden, Jack Murray), Dick(Robert Clark), Bub(Michael Seater), Tuff(Jordan Todosey, Ellary Porterfield), Mike(Ryan Price, Brendan Price), Barb(Jessica Pollack,Melanie Tonello), Betsy(Emily Persich, Julia Morgan Thompson), and Dave(Luca and Brando Barbaro, Maxwell Uretsky, Conor Sharp).A frequently embittered Kelly drinks away a third of his meager income during the course of this story, which takes place  predominantly in the 1950s and '60s when housewives like Evelyn turned to jingle writing contests sponsored by companies that produced household items, sustaining their families through the prizes they won through them.Evelyn proves to be one of the best at these endeavors, often winning the right prize at just the right time-one of the more relevant ones being a grocery store shopping spree which enables the struggling family to eat better than they normally did (the book on which this story is based notes that they were often dependent on relatives for help in that area).Evelyn previously won an icebox, which she is now able to fill because of the grocery store  shopping spree. But as is often the case, with each prize won, Kelly responds with bitterness, viewing each of these blessings as a threat to his role as the family's breadwinner. While he might have been more grateful for what was working in his life, a modern audience might appreciate him as a product of his time. But his drunken rampages previously resulted in his damaging the lid of the icebox at one point. While even at a young age, Tuff fearlessly confronts her father about his behavior, police called in to deal with the violent domestic situation, as well as the family priest, Father McCague(David Gardiner)are more sympathetic to Kelly, the latter failing to acknowledge that Evelyn does her best as a wife and mother, never really addressing the problems that need to be addressed and quizzing her youngest on whether on not his is being obedient and saying his prayers. Little Dave notes how much the priest's breath smells like his father's, suggesting that the priest's empathy with Kelly stems from his own tendency to have way too much Communion.Four of the older children leave home during the course of the story. Prior to that, we learn how contesters including Evelyn, use their children's names in their contest entries, and how the winners are selected.. Kelly himself occasionally partakes in contesting, but Evelyn has to resolve a dispute between him and Bruce over one of the prizes at one point.Trouble with some of the kids deprives Evelyn of her chance to travel when she wins trips to various places(although in reality, she and Bruce did get to go to New York), and the most difficult scene to watch is when Evelyn, who has often been in arrears in paying Ray the milkman(Simon Reynolds), is grabbed at by a belligerent Kelly, causing her to fall and spill the bottles of milk and severely cut herself, earning him Tuff's ire. Neighbor Mrs. Bidlack (Susan Merson), lends assistance. The horrific episode ends with a bandaged Evelyn still having written  a jingle in one of her ever-present notebook, and retaining a buoyant level of optimism.Nowadays such incidents would be handled differently.In 1963, after previous failed attempts, Evelyn, who does not drive, is finally able to attend a meeting of the Affadaisies, a group of fellow contesters, at the home of Emma Hartzler(Catherine Fitch), who is confined to an iron lung, in Goshen, Indiana. Like Evelyn, Emma handles adversity with much humor . Dortha Schaefer ( Laura Dern), a farm wife, who writes for a newspaper as Evelyn used to, and with whom Evelyn has been corresponding, is the first to greet her.En route to that rendezvous, the fan belt of the car needed repairing, and the feisty Tuff has a frank conversation with her mother about her feeling's about Evelyn's life. But her mother reassures her that she is content.Her time with the Affadaisies is enjoyable, and it is interesting to see  future writer, Tuff, among the group. These ladies include Gladys Tierney(Carolyn Scott) Betty yearling(Lindsay Leese) and Betty White(Tracey Hoyt), all of whom share Evelyn's knack for winning formidable prizes through jingle writing contests. The women, primly arrayed in  either well-coiffed ' dos  and/or hats and gloves, critique each other's work, and discuss whether or not the days of their style of contesting are coming to an end. Before her departure, Evelyn is presented with the last entry form of a Dr. Pepper contest.Once home, she deals with another crisis caused by Kelly's locking the other kids out of the house, due to not wanting them to see him cry from fear of Evelyn's abandoning him. He becomes violent again, Tuff jumps him, and Evelyn throws the Jello she'd made for dessert  on him to get him to cool off as we hear a recital of her jingle for that product. Evelyn  calmly explains how trouble with the fan belt prolonged their outing.The next crisis results from the news of impending foreclosure of their home due to Kelly's having taken out a second mortgage two years prior without Evelyn's knowledge, and not paying it back. Decisions about farming the kids out to relatives or neighbors must be considered. The kids gather in the closet to jointly pray the Rosary, hoping their mother wins a formidable monetary prize, and we will see whether these children who pray together will stay together.The basest point of all finds the Ryans feeding their kids the last remaining packages of soup, vainly trying to convince the kids that the weevils in them are spices.To be fair, Kelly could be generous towards his family, wanting his wife to have a decent piece of furniture, and his children to eat steak. But in modern times, women would not be encouraged to stay in such a difficult union, especially with the risk of daughters ending up in abusive relationships and sons becoming abusers. But after one final triumph for Evelyn, we learn that her children(the actual ones of whom make a poignant cameo) turn out alright despite much childhood adversity--a true testament to their mother's faith, fortitude, and indomitable spirit!",5,Playing a Poor Hand Well,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,7371,"['write', 'editorial', 'tribute', 'turbulent', 'warm-hearted', 'nostalgia', 'piece',

963997,A1UWGR88UD16Z6,B000DZIGEO,"Edward Rasen Jr. ""ExecEditor""","[2, 5]","Julianne Moore is superb as usual but she couldn't save this sad story about Evelyn Ryan, mother of ten children who continually makes excuses for Kelly Ryan, her abusive, alcoholic husband portrayed by Woody Harrelson. The screenplay is based on the memoir written by Terry ""Tuff"" Ryan, one of the ten Ryan children. She deserves accolades for honestly portraying her dysfunctional family. I don't agree with reviewers who think this an inspirational story. I think the moral of the story is simple: don't stay in a relationship with an alcoholic, don't be a co-dependent enabler, and don't think you can save an alcoholic.This film bombed at the box-office when it was released during October 2005: opening weekend gross was only $159,000 and after seven weeks it had generated a meager $626,310 in ticket sales. After that it disappeared from screens. Julianne Moore could not save this tale of despair.Although many reviewers rave about Julianne, I think scriptwriter/director Jane Anderson turned this into an ABC Family channel movie. Julianne supposedly triumphs over her evil husband because when he dies, she inherits his pension money and never has to work again. Whoopee! Fifty years of grief in exchange for a few years of financial security.However, I cannot condemn Evelyn Ryan because the story is primarily set in the mid-50s through mid-60s and by 1955 Evelyn had ten children. Also, when she seeks counsel from her local Roman Catholic priest, he tells her "" try harder"" to make the marriage work and tolerate her husband's alcoholic-fueled outbursts. I am surprised he did not encourage her to have more babies.Evelyn enters numerous product contests and uses her winnings to buy a small house in Defiance, Ohio which is almost lost when husband Kelly secretly takes out a second mortgage to fund his alcoholic binges. But, at the last minute Evelyn wins a big contest and pays off the the first and second mortgages. While it is a wet-eye moment, it isn't uplifting because Tuff Ryan says her father will never change. And, that is the moral of the story: neither uplifting or inspirational.Kelly Ryan apparently did not serve during World War II, perhaps because he was too young. He was a singer with a local band in his hometown until crashing his car and injuring his larynx. Unable to sing for a living, he was forced to toil in small machine shops. Alcohol became his escape.

963998,A2W4UPPE8RUT6Z,B000DZIGEO,"ElaineReads ""ElaineReads""","[9, 10]","The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio:I have actually been meaning to read the book on which this movie is based for a few years now, but still haven't managed to do so.  When I saw that it was made into a movie (through no help of TV previews or anything like that, I might add) I knew I had to see it.  From what I've been told, the movie stays pretty true to the book, and the Ryan family is happy with the finished product, which is always a plus.The story is heartwarming, and as you watch you really begin to care about them.  You're happy when they're happy, and you're sad when Evelyn or the kids are sad.  Julianne Moore did an excellent job in her role as Evelyn Ryan.  She plays a very believable 1950s-1960s housewife.  I was impressed.  Woody Harrelson also did a fantastic job playing Kelly Ryan, the alcoholic husband/father.  While I found it difficult to watch the scenes where he'd get drunk and become angry, I was comforted by knowing that he never really meant any of what he did or said.  I think the positive spin Evelyn put on most things really made the story as great as it is.The fact that this is based on a true story has to be the most important reason for why this is such a great movie.  Sometimes in life you have to deal with stressful, painful situations - many of which involve financial issues.  Seeing how Evelyn dealt with them, almost on a weekly basis, is very inspiring.  True, this was the 50s, and times were certainly different back then, but the true message behind this story can still be received and put into action in our daily lives: stay true to yourself, family first, and never underestimate the power of prayer.This is an all-around excellent movie, and I highly recommend it.  If I had to label it, I would call it a feel-good family movie.  I wasn't born until 1979, but this movie certainly left me feeling nostalgic for a time twenty years before my own.",5,Absolutely fantastic,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,1910,"['Prize', 'Winner', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'meaning', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'managed', 'do', 'so', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'help', 'TV', 'previews', 'anything', 'might', 'add', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'movie', 'pretty', 'true', 'book', 'Ryan', 'family', 'happy', 'finished', 'product', 'always', 'plus.The', 'story', 'heartwarming', 'watch', 'really', 'begin', 'care', ""'re"", 'happy', 'when', ""'re"", 'happy', ""'re"", 'sad', 'when', 'Evelyn', 'kids', 'are', 'sad', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'very', 'believable', '1950s-1960s', 'housewife', 'was', 'impressed', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'also', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'Kelly', 'Ryan', 'alcoholic', 'husband/father', 'found', 'difficult', 'watch', 'scenes', 'where', ""'d"", 'get', 'drunk', 'become', 'angry', 'was', 'comforted', 'knowing', 'never', 'really', 'meant', 'what', 'did', 'said', 'think', 'positive', 'spin', 'Evelyn', 'put', 'most', 'things', 'really', 'made', 'story', 'as', 'great', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'reason', 'why', 'such', 'great', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'life', 'have', 'deal', 'stressful', 'painful', 'situations', 'many', 'involve', 'financial', 'issues', 'Seeing', 'how', 'Evelyn', 'almost', 'weekly', 'basis', 'very', 'inspiring', 'True', 'was', '50s', 'times', 'were', 'certainly', 'different', 'back', 'then', 'true', 'message', 'story', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'received', 'put', 'action', 'daily', 'lives', 'stay', 'true', 'family', 'first', 'never', 'underestimate', 'power', 'prayer.This', 'all-around', 'excellent', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'had', 'label', 'would', 'call', 'feel-good', 'family', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'born', '1979', 'movie', 'certainly', 'left', 'feeling', 'nostalgic', 'time', 'twenty', 'years', 'own']",N/A
963999,A3FHSLWEMH7JD8,B000DZIGEO,"Elizabeth G. Melillo ""gloriana""","[5, 12]","Julianne Moore indeed gives an excellent performance in a largely one dimensional role. I suppose that those who mourn the demise of 'family values' would find the plucky heroine type to be inspiring. In my own case, I wondered if Evelyn, with her endless painfulness and cheerfulness, wasn't more the sort of Irish Catholic 'martyr' often popularised during the 1950s and 60s literature, an era when those with serious problems (whether in marriages, emotional state, disability, or illness) had to show that they never had a trace of 'self pity' or struggle. (Evelyn, I'm sure, would have equally counted her blessings, ""I only have a husband who destroys the property and loses the house - and look at that marvellously cheerful contest winner who is in an iron lung!"")The film is rather entertaining, the more if one who remembers the time period indulges a bit of nostalgia. One scene which seems to develop a theme is when Evelyn tells her daughter about enjoying each moment to the fullest - a philosophy which indeed is a gift. Yet one wonders whether Evelyn is hiding beneath a facade. Though her ability to enjoy such pleasures as come her way seems very genuine, she's a bit too perfect. There is never a moment of impatience with the ten children, sadness but never anger when her alcoholic husband goes into rages or even nearly loses their house. (The latter is saved only by Evelyn's fortuitously winning a major contest at the right moment.)The film is a pleasant enough way to pass a rainy afternoon, but I found it highly artificial. Unlike some women today, I do not find the conditions under which many housewives lived in the 1950s to be other than positive, nor do I assume having a large family had to be oppressive. I knew many women who lived happily in such circumstances. I also can well understand a talented, lively young woman's attraction to a charmer who happened to be alcoholic, since the deterioration with such an illness may be invisible in the very young. Yet I can see the dark side here - when one who has pain must not let it be seen, and, were she to try to share it, would be shrugged off with an exhortation to be a better wife (as her priest offers in the film) or condemned for 'feeling sorry for herself.'",2,Is this heartwarming or pathetic?,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,2252,"['Julianne', 'Moore', 'indeed', 'excellent', 'performance', 'largely', 'one', 'dimensional', 'role', 'suppose', 'who', 'mourn', 'demise', ""'family"", 'values', 'would', 'find', 'plucky', 'heroine', 'type', 'be', 'inspiring', 'own', 'case', 'wondered', 'Evelyn', 'endless', 'painfulness', 'cheerfulness', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'sort', 'Irish', 'Catholic', ""'martyr"", 'often', 'popularised', '1950s', '60s', 'literature', 'era', 'when', 'serious', 'problems', 'marriages', 'emotional', 'state', 'disability', 'illness', 'had', 'show', 'never', 'had', 'trace', 'pity', 'struggle', 'Evelyn', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'equally', 'counted', 'blessings', 'only', 'have', 'husband', 'who', 'property', 'house', 'look', 'marvellously', 'cheerful', 'contest', 'winner', 'who', 'iron', 'lung', 'film', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'more', 'one', 'who', 'time', 'period', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'One', 'scene', 'develop', 'theme', 'when', 'Evelyn', 'daughter', 'enjoying', 'moment', 'fullest', 'philosophy', 'indeed', 'gift', 'one', 'Evelyn', 'hiding', 'facade', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'such', 'pleasures', 'come', 'way', 'very', 'genuine', 'bit', 'too', 'perfect', 'never', 'moment', 'impatience', 'ten', 'children', 'sadness', 'never', 'anger', 'when', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'rages', 'even', 'nearly', 'house', 'latter', 'saved', 'only', 'Evelyn', 'fortuitously', 'winning', 'major', 'contest', 'right', 'moment', 'film', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'way', 'pass', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'found', 'highly', 'artificial', 'women', 'today', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'conditions', 'many', 'housewives', 'lived', '1950s', 'be', 'other', 'positive', 'do', 'assume', 'having', 'large', 'family', 'had', 'be', 'oppressive', 'knew', 'many', 'women', 'who', 'lived', 'happily', 'such', 'circumstances', 'also', 'can', 'well', 'understand', 'talented', 'lively', 'young', 'woman', 'attraction', 'charmer', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'alcoholic', 'deterioration', 'illness', 'may', 'be', 'invisible', 'very', 'young', 'can', 'see', 'dark', 'side', 'here', 'when', 'one', 'who', 'pain', 'must', 'not', 'let', 'be', 'seen', 'were', 'try', 'share', 'would', 'be', 'shrugged', 'off', 'exhortation', 'be', 'better', 'wife', 'priest', 'offers', 'film', 'condemned', ""'feeling"", 'sorry']",N/A

My wife, daughters, and I were drawn in by the easygoing humor of this story, then hooked by the family drama.Based on the true story of Evelyn Ryan, as detailed by her grown daughter in a book of the same name, ""The Prize Winner..."" is not only a beautiful account of a mother's love for her children, but also of her astonishing forgiveness and sacrifice for an irresponsible husband.  Julianne Moore is superb in this role, playing each scene with restraint and subtlety.  She is a housewife in the fifties and sixties, raising ten children, while putting her literary skill to use by earning money through mail-in contests.  Woody Harrelson plays the alcoholic and humiliated husband, who doesn't know whether to cheer for her success or feel sorry for himself for failing to be the breadwinner.  Though his performance isn't quite up to Julianne's, he pulls it off well enough for us to hang on his every scene, wondering if he'll burst or break down.  In conclusion, his character shows a little more depth than we first suspect--though just barely.In today's world, it's hard to imagine a wife would put up with the actions of such a husband(and for good reason!), yet Evelyn's faithfulness is a testimony to the strength of women--particularly in light of the times she lived.  The movie stands in stark contrast to the disintegration of marriages and families in the present.

Sounds like a silly little flick, but in reality it contains a fine re-creation of the 1950s, of the way women were viewed in that era, of the indomitable spirit of a mother who must raise ten children without the help of an inadequate husband - and a finely wrought performance by one of our bets actresses on the screen today.Julianne Moore gives one of her signature understated roles as Evelyn Ryan, creating an unlikely character in whom the audience finds a depth of substance and durability.  Living in Defiance, Ohio with her machinist cum alcoholic husband Kelly (Woody Harrelson) who is unable to bring home money after his purchases of booze to support his large family. Evelyn copes by entering contests of jingles and poems put out by advertising companies and with her earnings supports her family physically as well as emotionally. Though often thwarted by her husband's actions, she still manages to keep the boat afloat, to maintain her dreams, and to make the best of a bad situation.Moore is radiant as usual, but in this role she is even more subtle in creating an unlikely character than in even her best films.  She is a stunning actress and deserved at least an Oscar nomination for her strong work.  The story is based on truth and that helps its credibility as a film.

964004,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000DZIGEO,James Hiller,"[11, 13]","Normally, my equation is Julianne Moore = seat in the theater. I go out of my way to see her films; trusting her judgment and loving her work. However, this little jewel somehow surpassed me in the theaters and it wasn't until a rental that I finally saw this work, and the amazing, amazing life of one Evelyn Ryan.Based on a memoir by Terry Ryan, Prize Winner tells the story of Evelyn, a housewife, mother of ten, and married to a hopeless alcoholic. Due to his drinking problem, the family often found themselves short of cash. To supplement the budget, Evelyn turned to her writing talents, writing jingles, slogans, and sayings for products. Having a knack for such a thing, she finds herself winning a bevy of prizes, some small, like two dollars, and some a little bit bigger, like automobiles.Interspersed in the happy winning moments are her struggles with her husband, played by Woody Harrelson. A raging drunk, Kelly finds himself barely able to control his moments of exploding anger. In a movie so hopelessly chipper at times, these moments are painful and quite off-putting at times. Evelyn's handling of Kelly is a masterstroke in and of itself. Not able to end her marriage, or get support from the church,  Evelyn makes due and brings her family together even when he's being an ass.Julianne's performance is of her usual high quality and wonderful to watch. She's played 50's housewives before, and she has a knack with it. She manages to bring light into the moments when Woody goes into a tantrum, amazing. Woody's performance seems like a harsh caracature at first, but he grows into his role and he both mellows as he sinks into his failure.The true winning of the film is director Jane Anderson's brilliant directing decisions that make this film stick out. Frequently, Evelyn often breaks from the movie, and talks to us, still in character. The effect is charming. Cutaways that celebrate the 50's funky style are also quite fun to watch, and propel this film. These help what could have become a Lifetime movie of the week, into a more playful, happy romp, that the real Evelyn would have loved.In all, this movie isn't about winning prizes, or drunk husbands. It's about everyday heroes. You know the ones. The everyday heroes that go unlauded in our celebrity rife culture.

964005,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B000DZIGEO,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[5, 6]","Based on true events, Defiance is an inspiring tale that offers a unique slice of Americana.  In what other country during the 50's/60's afterall would you find a housewife and mother of 10 entering contests to make the mortgage payments and keep milk in the house?  We find it here in Defiance and thanks to Julianne Moore and Woody Harrelson Defiance is a winner.Moore plays Evelyn, a genuinely optimistic, highly intelligent, witty and monumentally strong mother of 10 children (11 if you count her drunken yet strangely empathetic husband Kelly).  While Kelly blows his paycheck on booze and disrupts things at home, Evelyn manages to always keep her family afloat by writing contest winning jingles.Moore could have easily made this character boiler plate and no one would have complained.  She could have played Evelyn as the sad martyr, a melancholy, inwardly forlorn soul who shrouds her sadness with forced smiles and a phony disposition to protect her children from the hard facts of their lot in life.  But she does not.  Moore instead paints Evelyn's character with a positivity in the face of adversity and imbues her with a devout belief in perserverance.  Her personality we come to find is genuine, not simply an act for the sake of the kids, as is her love, tolerance and empathy for her man-child husband Kelly.  Moore's choice to play Evelyn this way makes the character that much more admirable and extraordinary given what she endures on a daily basis.Harrelson plays an equally unique character in the father, Kelly.  It would have been very easy for Harrelson to mail in his performance by simply playing Kelly as a stock, one dimensional drunk devoid of any redeeming qualities.  He could have made it very easy to hate Kelly and leave it at that.  But Harrelson knows that such thin characters are never interesting and usually exist merely as a mechanism to progress a more sympathetic character's storyline.  Instead, Harrelson stikes a fine balance that makes you hate and pity Kelly at the same time.  He is clearly not the brains or the brawn of his family and he knows it.  Further, his co-workers know it.  A tough pill for a man to swallow during the era in which Defiance takes place.  Over the years we see Kelly devolve more and more into an emotionally helpless child of the family.  Kelly at once looks at his wife with resentment for her clearly superior strength and intelligence, but also with the awe and respect a 5 year gives to an all knowing parent.  To Harrelson's credit, we see Kelly more as a sad character in the long run and less as a drunken monster.  We realize that Kelly is simply not capable of any more than what he contributes to the family.There are other good performances in the film, but make no mistake Moore and Harrelson shoulder 95% of the load here and do it in fine fashion.  Defiance has drama, humor and above all a heart.  It will pull at your heartstrings and make you want to hug mom and say thank you.",4,Moore and Harrelson Shine,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,2976,"['Based', 'true', 'events', 'Defiance', 'inspiring', 'tale', 'unique', 'slice', 'Americana', 'what', 'other', 'country', ""50's/60"", 'afterall', 'would', 'find', 'housewife', 'mother', '10', 'entering', 'contests', 'make', 'mortgage', 'payments', 'keep', 'milk', 'house', 'find', 'here', 'Defiance', 'thanks', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Defiance', 'winner.Moore', 'Evelyn', 'genuinely', 'optimistic', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'monumentally', 'strong', 'mother', '10', 'children', '11', 'count', 'drunken', 'yet', 'strangely', 'empathetic', 'husband', 'Kelly', 'Kelly', 'paycheck', 'booze', 'disrupts', 'things', 'home', 'Evelyn', 'always', 'keep', 'family', 'afloat', 'writing', 'contest', 'winning', 'jingles.Moore', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'made', 'character', 'boiler', 'plate', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'complained', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Evelyn', 'sad', 'martyr', 'melancholy', 'inwardly', 'forlorn', 'soul', 'who', 'sadness', 'forced', 'smiles', 'phony', 'disposition', 'protect', 'children', 'hard', 'facts', 'lot', 'life', 'not', 'Moore', 'instead', 'Evelyn', 'character', 'positivity', 'face', 'adversity', 'devout', 'belief', 'perserverance', 'personality', 'come', 'find', 'genuine', 'not', 'simply', 'act', 'sake', 'kids', 'love', 'tolerance', 'empathy', 'man-child', 'husband', 'Kelly', 'Moore', 'choice', 'play', 'Evelyn', 'way', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'admirable', 'extraordinary', 'given', 'what', 'daily', 'basis.Harrelson', 'equally', 'unique', 'character', 'father', 'Kelly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'Harrelson', 'mail', 'performance', 'simply', 'playing', 'Kelly', 'stock', 'one', 'dimensional', 'drunk', 'devoid', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'easy', 'hate', 'Kelly', 'leave', 'Harrelson', 'such', 'thin', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'interesting', 'usually', 'exist', 'merely', 'mechanism', 'progress', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'storyline', 'Instead', 'Harrelson', 'fine', 'balance', 'hate', 'pity', 'Kelly', 'same', 'time', 'clearly', 'not', 'brains', 'brawn', 'family', 'Further', 'co-workers', 'know', 'tough', 'pill', 'man', 'swallow', 'era', 'Defiance', 'place', 'years', 'see', 'Kelly', 'devolve', 'more', 'more', 'emotionally', 'helpless', 'child', 'family', 'Kelly', 'once', 'wife', 'resentment', 'clearly', 'superior', 'strength', 'intelligence', 'also', 'awe', 'respect', '5', 'year', 'knowing', 'parent', 'Harrelson', 'credit', 'see', 'Kelly', 'more', 'sad', 'character', 'long', 'run', 'less', 'drunken', 'monster', 'realize', 'Kelly', 'simply', 'not', 'capable', 'more', 'what', 'family.There', 'are', 'other', 'good', 'performances', 'film', 'make', 'mistake', 'Moore', 'Harrelson', 'shoulder', '95', '%', 'load', 'here', 'do', 'fine', 'fashion', 'Defiance', 'drama', 'humor', 'heart', 'will', 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'make', 'want', 'hug', 'mom', 'say', 'thank']",N/A

964010,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000DZIGEO,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","""The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio"" is based on a true story and starsJulianne Moore and Woody Harrelson, who gives one of his best performances. The movie stars Moore as Evelyn Ryan, a mother of 10, who managed to raise her kids by writing Jingles for contests. For those who don't know what a Jingle is, it's a short song that companies used to promote their products with. Instead of that annoying commercial saying ""Head on apply directly to the forehead"" 3 times. It would say, something along the lines of ""Put Head on your forehead. With the headache you got, you probably want to be dead."" Yes, that was terrible and yes, I went into too much detail while explaining what a jingle is. Anway, Evelyn has an uncanny knack for writing jingles and frequently wins things such as shopping sprees, money, and, at one point, 1/2 off on carpet. Meanwhile, her machinist husband Kelly (Harrelson) is a drunk; Kelly tries to make money for his family, but tends to blow it on booze. Harrelson is great in the film, delivering the strongest performance (don't get me wrong though, Moore is great)...But his character is also one of the films downsides. In the movie, Harrelson's character is introduced as a mean guy whom you dislike and I couldn't help wonder why Evelyn would put up with the guy. Yeah, he has his moments of niceness in the film. He's not an evil character or anything like that, he's just not the sweetest guy in the world. The movie will appeal mostly to people who look for ""feel-good"" movies that kind of lift your spirits. This film definitely does that, but there are times when you feel as if you've been down this road before. It's a fine movie, but you won't be finding it on any Top 10 Lists when the year ends.GRADE: B",4,Uplifting and Sweet Little Movie,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,1746,"['Prize', 'Winner', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'starsJulianne', 'Moore', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'movie', 'Moore', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'mother', '10', 'who', 'managed', 'raise', 'kids', 'writing', 'Jingles', 'contests', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Jingle', 'short', 'song', 'companies', 'used', 'promote', 'products', 'Instead', 'annoying', 'commercial', 'saying', 'Head', 'apply', 'directly', 'forehead', '3', 'times', 'would', 'say', 'something', 'lines', 'Put', 'Head', 'forehead', 'headache', 'got', 'probably', 'want', 'be', 'dead', 'Yes', 'was', 'terrible', 'yes', 'went', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'explaining', 'what', 'jingle', 'Anway', 'Evelyn', 'uncanny', 'knack', 'writing', 'jingles', 'frequently', 'things', 'such', 'shopping', 'sprees', 'money', 'one', 'point', '1/2', 'carpet', 'Meanwhile', 'machinist', 'husband', 'Kelly', 'Harrelson', 'drunk', 'Kelly', 'make', 'money', 'family', 'blow', 'booze', 'Harrelson', 'great', 'film', 'delivering', 'strongest', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Moore', 'great', 'character', 'also', 'one', 'films', 'downsides', 'movie', 'Harrelson', 'character', 'introduced', 'mean', 'guy', 'whom', 'dislike', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'Evelyn', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'guy', 'Yeah', 'moments', 'niceness', 'film', 'not', 'evil', 'character', 'anything', 'just', 'not', 'sweetest', 'guy', 'world', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'feel-good', 'movies', 'kind', 'lift', 'spirits', 'film', 'definitely', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'road', 'fine', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'finding', 'Top', '10', 'Lists', 'when', 'year', 'ends.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
964011,A2SH17ZKPJNI76,B000DZIGEO,Karen Sampson Hudson,"[5, 6]","Julianne Moore shines in this family drama based on a memoir written by one of the ten children of Evelyn and Kelly Ryan.  She portrays a strong-spirited, intelligent woman who is determined to make the best of a bad situation.  Woody Harrelson does a fine job also as her alcoholic husband, who often buys whiskey instead of setting aside milk money for his super-sized family.  ""He may be unhelpful, "" Evelyn at one point tells one of her daughters, ""but he's not mean.""Evelyn finds herself locked into a 1950s nightmare situation as a Catholic mother in 1950s Ohio, when there was no Al-Anon, when she had to rely on her machinist husband's paycheck to feed and clothe her burgeoning family, when she had no one to one to rely on but herself and her verbal skills.  By entering contests and promotions she was able to supplement a  bleak subsistence.  An especially good scene is when she wins a grocery ""shopping spree"" and brings home caviar and other delicacies for everyone to sample!One thing that I found rather funny is that the children often remain still and silent while the adults speak and the drama unfolds---a necessary convention for a movie, but unrealistic to anyone who is familiar with the busy noisiness of a group of young children.  Another thing that I found unintentionally humorous is that when Evelyn cooks, she seems to be making meals for a family of four, not twelve, judging from the ingredients and amounts she uses! Hollywood producers and scene designers seem not to be aware of the realities of large family life.The director, and Julianne Moore, do pull off the challenging feat of making this an upbeat, light story; they do this without a lot of sugar-coating, and do present the serious problems Evelyn had to face.

964015,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000DZIGEO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","""The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio"" is one of those films that can get me into trouble. Based on the life of Evelyn Ryan, and adapted from her daughter's memoir, the film depicts an honorable story of perseverance, positive attitude, and survival. In fact, it's such an earnest and inspirational story that one might be inclined to overlook the film's flaws. Many will! But while I admire Ryan's story, and it is genuinely fascinating, ""Prize Winner"" is only moderately successful as a film. A fanciful narrative, a frothy tone, and colorful visuals often seem at odds with a film that is also trying to be a biographical treatment of Ryan's life. And as Ryan's life was filled with many adversities such as abuse, alcoholism, and poverty--the lightweight tone can be somewhat unsettling in the more dramatic moments.Julianne Moore portrays Evelyn Ryan, a mother of ten (yes, ten) children. Well, let me tell you, raising ten kids doesn't come cheap--especially when your husband has a spotty work record and an insatiable need for drink. Set during the fifties and sixties, Moore depicts Ryan as a perennially upbeat person. Ryan has a special talent that she employs to keep her family fed, she enters and wins lots of contests. Back in the day, you actually had to have skill to win these contests and Ryan had a knack for jingles and slogans. Winning many prizes (to keep and/or sell) she supported the family in this very unorthodox way. It really is a special and unusual story.The tone of the film is so light, though. Moore often appears in scenes with herself to narrate the action, and it's a fun visual device. The whole thing plays not as realism, but as a Disney-type family fantasy film. That might work but the film is also wrestling with some much more downbeat topics. Woody Harrelson, as Ryan's husband, often explodes in drunken rages and terrorizes Evelyn and the kids. Some of these scenes are quite unpleasant--and it's as if they are from a completely different movie. There is a lot of misery within this uplifting story, but for me the transitions were awkward. The picture never gels as a cohesive whole so the drama ends up lacking in emotional impact. An instant after one of these attacks occurs, we're right back to a comedic tone.I'd probably watch Julianne Moore in anything, however, and this film has a lot to recommend it. I know that the director intended to tug at my heartstrings, but the way ""Prize Winner"" was constructed kept me from appreciating this as a true life story of triumph. Instead, it's passably entertaining and that is not a commentary on the real Evelyn Ryan!

Evelyn, on the other hand, forgives him his faults and simply works twice as hard to make up for them.

Bernabo,"[8, 9]","This 2005 movie is based on Terry ""Tuff"" Ryan's encomium to her mother, ""The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio: How My Mother Raised 10 Kids on 25 Words or Less.""  Evelyn (Julianne Moore) married Kelly Ryan (Woody Harrelson) and had those ten children, and entered every company contest under the sun to win everything from bicycles and a sled to grocery shopping sprees and cars.  Evelyn is brilliantly creative, but she lives in a time and place when ""Mother"" stays home and takes care of the kids while ""Father"" goes out an earns the daily bread.The problem is that in addition to their being a dozen mouths to feed in the Ryan household, Kelly is an alcoholic.  So is the family priest, whose advice to Evelyn is not take the kids and run but shut up and give this loser a happy home.  Unfortunately her efforts to do that and to keep the family from starving to death only infuriate the unhappy Kelly even more.  Later in the film she explains the world she has created to survive when she tells her husband, ""I don't need you to make me happy. I just need you to leave me alone when I am.""  This admission is the most she will say to her husband, despite his drinking and bursts of violent outrage, his jealousy over her success, and her almost getting seriously hurt literally over spilled milk.  But when she gets home from the hospital she writes a humorous poem about it, proving that her creativity is more than just an attempt to win prizes, it is how she survives in this unhappy home.Since Kelly likes to drink a six-pack and put away a pint each night and Evelyn wins cars from time to time, part of me was hoping that such prizes would provide the solution to his problem.  But ""The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio"" is about endurance and survival.  In the end it is important that Evelyn win rather than having Kelly finally lose.  Her ultimate triumph plays out against his ultimate injury added to the constant insults that he lays upon his family.  However, that is a victory for her entire family, while the more personal moment of triumph is when she finally gets to visit her pen pal Dortha Schaefer (Laura Dern) and a group of her peers, other women ""contesters"" who acknowledge her as the best of the bunch.  How good is Evelyn?  Well, you can keep track of all the things she wins for her family, or you can just notice that her biggest win comes from something she cheerfully admits is not even her best effort.Moore's performance is on point and the best tribute I can pay to it would be that I was never thinking about that performance but about what a great woman Evelyn Ryan was and imagining what she could have done in a world that would have let her talents shine through.  There is a nice moment at the end of the film when the real ""Tuff"" Ryan shows up to share a final moment with the Evelyn portrayed by Moore, and both the final bit before the end credits and one of the special features use snapshots from Evelyn Ryan's scrapbook so that viewers can see the fruits of her victory.  Writer-director Jane Anderson last did ""Normal,"" but one of her first scripts was for ""The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom,"" and it is interesting to compare and contrast how she makes one mom look so good and other look so bad.  There is some redemption for Kelly, although it will be too little far too late for most viewers (and is glossed over in the wrap up), but in the end this film is just from ""Tuff"" intended: a loving testament to her remarkable mother.",4,"A loving testimonial to Evelyn Ryan from her daughter, ""Tuff""",1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,3524,"['2005', 'movie', 'based', 'Terry', 'Tuff', 'Ryan', 'encomium', 'mother', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'How', 'Mother', 'Raised', '10', 'Kids', '25', 'Words', 'Less', 'Evelyn', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'married', 'Kelly', 'Ryan', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'had', 'ten', 'children', 'entered', 'company', 'contest', 'sun', 'win', 'everything', 'bicycles', 'sled', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'sprees', 'cars', 'Evelyn', 'brilliantly', 'creative', 'time', 'place', 'when', 'Mother', 'home', 'care', 'kids', 'Father', 'out', 'daily', 'bread.The', 'problem', 'addition', 'being', 'dozen', 'mouths', 'feed', 'Ryan', 'household', 'Kelly', 'alcoholic', 'family', 'priest', 'advice', 'Evelyn', 'not', 'take', 'kids', 'run', 'shut', 'up', 'give', 'loser', 'happy', 'home', 'Unfortunately', 'efforts', 'do', 'keep', 'family', 'starving', 'death', 'only', 'infuriate', 'unhappy', 'Kelly', 'even', 'more', 'Later', 'film', 'world', 'created', 'survive', 'when', 'husband', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'happy', 'just', 'need', 'leave', 'alone', 'when', 'am', 'admission', 'most', 'will', 'say', 'husband', 'drinking', 'bursts', 'violent', 'outrage', 'jealousy', 'success', 'almost', 'getting', 'seriously', 'hurt', 'literally', 'spilled', 'milk', 'when', 'home', 'hospital', 'humorous', 'poem', 'proving', 'creativity', 'more', 'just', 'attempt', 'win', 'prizes', 'how', 'unhappy', 'home.Since', 'Kelly', 'drink', 'six-pack', 'put', 'away', 'pint', 'night', 'Evelyn', 'cars', 'time', 'time', 'part', 'was', 'hoping', 'such', 'prizes', 'would', 'provide', 'solution', 'problem', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'endurance', 'survival', 'end', 'important', 'Evelyn', 'win', 'rather', 'having', 'Kelly', 'finally', 'lose', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'out', 'ultimate', 'injury', 'added', 'constant', 'insults', 'family', 'However', 'victory', 'entire', 'family', 'more', 'personal', 'moment', 'triumph', 'when', 'finally', 'visit', 'pen', 'pal', 'Dortha', 'Schaefer', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'group', 'peers', 'other', 'women', 'contesters', 'who', 'acknowledge', 'best', 'bunch', 'How', 'good', 'Evelyn', 'Well', 'can', 'keep', 'track', 'things', 'family', 'can', 'just', 'notice', 'biggest', 'win', 'something', 'cheerfully', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'effort.Moore', 'performance', 'point', 'best', 'tribute', 'can', 'pay', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'never', 'thinking', 'performance', 'what', 'great', 'woman', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'was', 'imagining', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'let', 'talents', 'shine', 'nice', 'moment', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'real', 'Tuff', 'Ryan', 'up', 'share', 'final', 'moment', 'Evelyn', 'portrayed', 'Moore', 'final', 'bit', 'end', 'credits', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'use', 'snapshots', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'scrapbook', 'so', 'viewers', 'can', 'see', 'fruits', 'victory', 'Writer-director', 'Jane', 'Anderson', 'last', 'did', 'Normal', 'one', 'first', 'scripts', 'was', 'Positively', 'True', 'Adventures', 'Alleged', 'Texas', 'Cheerleader-Murdering', 'Mom', 'interesting', 'compare', 'contrast', 'how', 'one', 'mom', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'other', 'look', 'so', 'bad', 'redemption', 'Kelly', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'little', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'most', 'viewers', 'glossed', 'wrap', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'Tuff', 'intended', 'loving', 'testament', 'remarkable', 'mother']",N/A

He had dreamed of being a singer but lost his singing voice in a car accident, and was often cruel and abusive.In the movie, Evelyn wins a large freezer, ice buckets, a washing machine, a trip to New York, sleds, boots, a pony, a palm tree, a window, a sports car, a shopping spree in her local grocery store, ice crushers, a camera, dance shoes, a boat motor, pogo sticks, a case of dog food, and a lifetime supply of bird seed. Kelly, who feels like his role as provider for the family is being threatened, criticizes Evelyn and sometimes damages the prizes she wins. Their children side with her. At one point, Kelly gets angry at his wife and knocks her over while she is carrying 12 full glass bottles of milk, causing her to nearly sever a ligament. Evelyn is able to talk him down after each incident and, temporarily at least, he treats her better.Evelyn is largely isolated because of the hours she has to spend caring for the children and the lack of local intellectual equals. However, she is contacted by a group of other contest-entering mid-western housewives and befriends them.Ultimately, Evelyn discovers that Kelly had secretly taken out a second mortgage on their house and never made payments on it, leaving the family subject to an almost-certain foreclosure. The children pray for their mother's miraculous victory in a contest sponsored by Dr Pepper. She wins and pays the mortgage on the house.In the closing sequence, set years later, we learn that after Kelly died, Evelyn finds out that he has placed his pension checks in a bank account especially for her.

The film does a good job of showing the lives of absolute drudgery and small-town dreariness that many women led at the time. The scenes with Mrs. Ryan arguing with the milkman over unpaid bills brought back memories of my own childhood. In those days, if a family lost credit with the milkman and the corner grocery store, they had to go without, just as the Ryan family does in the film. I agree with poster B.Niedt that the only jarring part of the film is Mrs. Ryan talking directly to the audience. Women of Ryan's generation (especially in a place like Ohio) would have been too self-effacing to talk about themselves in such a direct way. Woody Harrelson is scarily effective in the thankless role of Evelyn's alcoholic machinist husband. The film ends with the actual grown Ryan children in the family home after Evelyn's death and her writer daughter Tuff inheriting her mother's typewriter.

I'm a fan of Julianne Moore, though, and the opening credits looked fun, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Glad I did. Moore is, as always, wonderful in it, and it was definitely worth watching. In a nutshell, Evelyn Ryan (Moore), Catholic housewife and mother on TEN children, has a way with words. She's married to luckless, alcoholic Kelly Ryan (played pitch-perfect by Woody Harrelson), who drinks away the money he makes as a machinist in a local factory. For fun, and to help make ends meet, Evelyn participates in national contests for jingles, rhymes, and other marketing mumbo jumbo. And she's good, too. Her winnings make up the down payment on the Ryan house and also include cars, kitchen appliances, supermarket sweeps, and more. Frustrated Kelly is by turns resentful and amazed at his wife's prowess as she neatly feeds and cares for their brood. The movie is based on a true story, and for the most part, it's a feel-good family flick.Moore and Harrelson are the true stars of the film, and I don't know which one is better. Moore's character is imminently sympathetic, maintaining a good attitude and a can-do spirit in spite of her husband's failings. In contrast, Harrelson is masterful as Kelly, a good-natured but weak man who can't seem to succeed. He is torn - his status as sole provider is consistently challenged, making him defensive. However, at heart, the viewer does feel that he loves his wife implicitly and admires (indeed, depends on) her resourcefulness.",4,"More Moore, Please",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,1560,"['stumbled', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'totally', 'accident', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'though', 'opening', 'credits', 'looked', 'fun', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', 'Glad', 'did', 'Moore', 'always', 'wonderful', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'nutshell', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'Moore', 'Catholic', 'housewife', 'mother', 'TEN', 'children', 'way', 'words', 'married', 'luckless', 'alcoholic', 'Kelly', 'Ryan', 'played', 'pitch-perfect', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'who', 'away', 'money', 'machinist', 'local', 'factory', 'fun', 'help', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Evelyn', 'national', 'contests', 'jingles', 'rhymes', 'other', 'marketing', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'good', 'too', 'winnings', 'make', 'up', 'down', 'payment', 'Ryan', 'house', 'also', 'include', 'cars', 'kitchen', 'appliances', 'supermarket', 'sweeps', 'more', 'Frustrated', 'Kelly', 'turns', 'resentful', 'amazed', 'wife', 'prowess', 'neatly', 'feeds', 'cares', 'brood', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'feel-good', 'family', 'flick.Moore', 'Harrelson', 'are', 'true', 'stars', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'better', 'Moore', 'character', 'imminently', 'sympathetic', 'maintaining', 'good', 'attitude', 'can-do', 'spirit', 'spite', 'husband', 'failings', 'contrast', 'Harrelson', 'masterful', 'Kelly', 'good-natured', 'weak', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'succeed', 'torn', 'status', 'sole', 'provider', 'consistently', 'challenged', 'making', 'defensive', 'However', 'heart', 'viewer', 'feel', 'wife', 'implicitly', 'admires', 'indeed', 'resourcefulness']",N/A

964034,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000DZIGEO,Samuel McKewon,"[7, 25]","""The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio,"" is a goofy, harmless creation that doesn't really intend to be, and could have been more than a Reader's Digest movie were it not so gee golly bent on being a feminist bedtime story.Evelyn Ryan, who raised ten kids (and a drunk husband) as a sweepstakes poet in the 1950s and 60s, is presented by writer/director Jane Anderson as such a saintly rainbow that it blunts most of Julianne Moore's considerable acting talents. Moore has twice covered the housewife-trapped-in-an-empty-marriage territory with ""Far From Heaven"" and ""The Hours,"" and picked up two Oscar nominations with her skill of revealing the emotional undercurrents not necessarily on paper. But not in a movie that insists we love her from the opening frame.Adapted from the autobiography of Ryan's daughter, Terry, ""Prize Winner"" is narrated in first person by Evelyn, who enters product contests as a means of supporting her husband, Kelly (Woody Harrelson), who drinks away most of his earnings from the local mill. The movie presents Kelly as a fantastic boob - think of Woody from ""Cheers"" on a constant bender - who Evelyn so greatly disdains she just keeps having kids with him.And those kids eye him without fear, jaw at the breakfast table, even leap on him during a family fight. The guy's a cartoon villain melting like the Wicked Witch of the West when Evelyn tosses Jell-O on him. ""You've killed me mother,"" he says in horror. Harrelson is brilliant in ""Prize Winner,"" a hapless-yet-observant basket case of whiskey and wife-beaters. What'll Kelly get into next?Except alcoholism isn't funny, or shouldn't be, and the role is so over-the-top that it works against the Ryan family's struggles. The same goes for a cruel, oddly dramatic milkman who habitually taunts and threatens Evelyn.

964035,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B000DZIGEO,Sheryl Fechter,"[3, 3]","From the memoir written by daughter, Terry (""Tuff""), comes this lovely tribute to her mother, Evelyn Ryan - ""The Contester"".  Another astounding performance by Julianne Moore reprising the role of a spirited and unique 1950's - 1960's homemaker living in Defiance, Ohio.  This movie is so relevant in the special way Evelyn keeps her family together in the midst of overwhelming emotional and financial chaos.  With an abundance of intelligence and a masterful prowess with words, she supports her family and establishes a 'thinking woman' in this popular persona.Screenwriter and director Jane Anderson brings us a homemaker, and mother of ten children in small-town Ohio.  She then expands her with a broad stroke of literary knowledge and a delightful vehicle in which to apply it.  Evelyn writes jingles and slogans for products, back in the day when they awarded prizes, appliances, and really big money to the winning submitter.  On many occasions it was Evelyn who was the one winning, therefore adding to the household in many ways.  Her charm, her snappy wit, but mainly - her love carries her family through the many storms in life, and almost inevitably, through even more.  All the while refusing to wallow in anything negative, Evelyn is just too busy and far too positive ...She is married to her volatile, although emotionally immature husband, Kelly  (Woody Harrelson).  The major problem is his alcoholism along with its indecisive nature.  He spends the vast amount of their paycheck in the liquor store and forces the family to live on a shoestring budget.  I first questioned their marriage and the reason they stayed together although it is at this point that the movie takes us back to their hooking up. It's believable that their initial sparks are enough, along with a tragic incident occurring for Kelly, to hold these two together for the long haul.  And did I mention their Ten Children yet?Evelyn is amazing in the way she handles her husband; taking on alcohol-fueled rages and diffusing the timebombs while they are exploding in her own kitchen.  The chest freezer winds up being the focal point of anger and distraction for Kelly.  It represents all that he can't provide for his family ... and everything that she can.""I just have to sit down and have myself a happy cry"".  Evelyn never stays down too long, not even after something life altering occurs, she is just this buoyant.  Midway through, she is finally able to get away from home and meet her pen pal and friend, Dorothy (Laura Dern), at a get together for their writing club.  It is here, among all her like-minded  peers, where Evelyn shines her brilliance and is totally within her own element.  She becomes inspired all over again and enters yet another big sweepstakes; The Big Sweepstakes.The harmony of this story all comes together with its easily enjoyable music soundtrack (John Frizzell).  Applying an upbeat buoyancy to the movie, the happy mood is purposely kept above water while celebrating songs by 'k.d. lang' and 'Les Paul and Mary Ford'.Stay with this until the end credits to meet the actual writer, Terry 'Tuff' (making an emotional appearance), along with Evelyn's entire brood in pictures.  It will tug at your heartstrings and have you waxing nostalgic.  This endearing work is dedicated to Tuff's mother although this story is a love letter written to mothers everywhere ... along with bringing some Americana at its finest.",5,"""Small Household Adversities Were My Steady Inspiration"" - Evelyn Ryan",1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,3441,"['memoir', 'written', 'daughter', 'Terry', 'Tuff', 'lovely', 'tribute', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'Contester', 'astounding', 'performance', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'reprising', 'role', 'spirited', 'unique', '1950', '1960', 'homemaker', 'living', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'movie', 'so', 'relevant', 'special', 'way', 'Evelyn', 'family', 'together', 'midst', 'overwhelming', 'emotional', 'financial', 'chaos', 'abundance', 'intelligence', 'masterful', 'prowess', 'words', 'family', ""'thinking"", 'woman', 'popular', 'persona.Screenwriter', 'director', 'Jane', 'Anderson', 'homemaker', 'mother', 'ten', 'children', 'small-town', 'Ohio', 'then', 'broad', 'stroke', 'literary', 'knowledge', 'delightful', 'vehicle', 'apply', 'Evelyn', 'jingles', 'slogans', 'products', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'awarded', 'prizes', 'appliances', 'really', 'big', 'money', 'winning', 'submitter', 'many', 'occasions', 'was', 'Evelyn', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'winning', 'therefore', 'adding', 'household', 'many', 'ways', 'charm', 'snappy', 'wit', 'mainly', 'love', 'family', 'many', 'storms', 'life', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'even', 'more', 'while', 'refusing', 'wallow', 'anything', 'negative', 'Evelyn', 'just', 'too', 'busy', 'far', 'too', 'positive', 'married', 'volatile', 'emotionally', 'immature', 'husband', 'Kelly', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'major', 'problem', 'alcoholism', 'indecisive', 'nature', 'vast', 'amount', 'paycheck', 'liquor', 'store', 'family', 'live', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'first', 'questioned', 'marriage', 'reason', 'stayed', 'together', 'point', 'movie', 'back', 'hooking', 'up', 'believable', 'initial', 'sparks', 'are', 'enough', 'tragic', 'incident', 'occurring', 'Kelly', 'hold', 'two', 'together', 'long', 'haul', 'did', 'mention', 'Ten', 'Children', 'yet', 'Evelyn', 'amazing', 'way', 'husband', 'taking', 'alcohol-fueled', 'rages', 'diffusing', 'timebombs', 'are', 'exploding', 'own', 'kitchen', 'chest', 'freezer', 'up', 'being', 'focal', 'point', 'anger', 'distraction', 'Kelly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'provide', 'family', 'everything', 'can', 'just', 'have', 'sit', 'down', 'have', 'happy', 'cry', 'Evelyn', 'never', 'down', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'even', 'something', 'life', 'altering', 'occurs', 'just', 'buoyant', 'Midway', 'finally', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'home', 'meet', 'pen', 'pal', 'friend', 'Dorothy', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'get', 'together', 'writing', 'club', 'here', 'like-minded', 'peers', 'where', 'Evelyn', 'brilliance', 'totally', 'own', 'element', 'inspired', 'over', 'again', 'enters', 'yet', 'big', 'sweepstakes', 'Big', 'Sweepstakes.The', 'harmony', 'story', 'together', 'easily', 'enjoyable', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'John', 'Frizzell', 'Applying', 'upbeat', 'buoyancy', 'movie', 'happy', 'mood', 'purposely', 'kept', 'water', 'celebrating', 'songs', 'k.d', 'lang', 'Paul', 'Mary', ""Ford'.Stay"", 'end', 'meet', 'actual', 'writer', 'Terry', ""'Tuff"", 'making', 'emotional', 'appearance', 'Evelyn', 'entire', 'brood', 'pictures', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'have', 'waxing', 'nostalgic', 'endearing', 'work', 'dedicated', 'Tuff', 'mother', 'story', 'love', 'letter', 'written', 'mothers', 'everywhere', 'bringing', 'Americana', 'finest']",N/A

Although he had a decent job as a machinist, he drank much of his paycheck, and his wife was forced to use her wits to support the family. Luckily, she was brainy and excelled in writing catchy lines for marketing promos.Those were the days, back in the mid-50s, when people could enter contests and win big prizes. Our heroine, Evelyn Ryan, played by Julianne Moore, wins one contest after another, all the while struggling to keep her family afloat. The sexism that existed 50 years ago is appalling to watch today. Everyone from the priest to the police to the milkman seems to either blame her or turn a blind eye to her husband's financial neglect of the family.Evelyn has a special bond with her older daughter, Tuff, the writer of this story, and that is particularly touching.

Obviously not in the right places, because this painfully overlooked gem plopped in the 2005 movie pool with nary a ripple, and what a great shame that was.Julianne Moore, never more radiant, plays Evelyn Ryan, a mother of ten (ten!) children, and wife to Kelly (Woody Harrelson, also splendid), an alcoholic who travels from sweet and timid to brutally viscous with the swig out of a scotch bottle.  The family struggles to get by on the little that's left after Kelly spends much of the family income at the liquor store. The enterprising Evelyn, a talented writer who is unfortunately chained to the kitchen by the antiquated views of the times, fills in many of the gaps by submitting winning entries to the myriad of contests that were the fashion at the time, using rhyme, alliteration and wit to create a host of snappy jingles and slogans.  That, in effect, is the story arc of this fine film.  It's what happens along the way that drives the picture and makes the magic. Based on the memoirs of daughter Terry Ryan, ""The Prize Winner of Defiance, Iowa"" successfully presents a warm, nostalgic look at the late fifties/early sixties, now vintage and in vogue, by using furniture styles and actual appliances from the period. Moore said in interviews that she even wore dresses that had belonged to the real Evelyn Ryan.Much of the credit must go to Director Jane Anderson, who cleverly adds splashy touches by bringing the tv jingle singers right into the frame, smiling Colgate smiles as they sing the catchy tunes even as Evelyn types them. To her credit, Anderson does not demonize the alcoholic Kelly, instead gently illustrates why nothing is truly all black and white. Although neither was nominated, Julianne Moore and Woody Harrelsons performances are absolutely deserving of Academy Awards, an egregious mistake.  Gorgeously shot and highly evocative of the era it depicts, ""The Prize winner of Defiance, Iowa"" is a captivating and honest glimpse into the true story of the struggles and successes of an American family.",4,"""Prize Winner"" is Praise Worthy",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,2206,"['Where', 'oh', 'where', 'was', 'marketing', 'money', 'spent', 'engrossing', 'look', 'American', 'family', 'atomic', 'age', 'Studebakers', 'black', 'white', 'tv', 'milkmen', 'Dwight', 'D.', 'Obviously', 'not', 'right', 'places', 'painfully', 'overlooked', 'gem', 'plopped', '2005', 'movie', 'pool', 'ripple', 'what', 'great', 'shame', 'Moore', 'never', 'more', 'radiant', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan', 'mother', 'ten', 'ten', 'children', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'also', 'splendid', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'sweet', 'timid', 'brutally', 'viscous', 'swig', 'scotch', 'bottle', 'family', 'get', 'little', 'left', 'Kelly', 'much', 'family', 'income', 'liquor', 'store', 'enterprising', 'Evelyn', 'talented', 'writer', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'chained', 'kitchen', 'antiquated', 'views', 'times', 'fills', 'many', 'gaps', 'submitting', 'winning', 'entries', 'myriad', 'contests', 'were', 'fashion', 'time', 'using', 'rhyme', 'alliteration', 'wit', 'create', 'host', 'snappy', 'jingles', 'slogans', 'effect', 'story', 'arc', 'fine', 'film', 'what', 'way', 'picture', 'magic', 'Based', 'memoirs', 'daughter', 'Terry', 'Ryan', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'Defiance', 'Iowa', 'successfully', 'warm', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'late', 'fifties/early', 'sixties', 'now', 'vintage', 'vogue', 'using', 'furniture', 'styles', 'actual', 'appliances', 'period', 'Moore', 'said', 'interviews', 'even', 'wore', 'dresses', 'had', 'belonged', 'real', 'Evelyn', 'Ryan.Much', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'Director', 'Jane', 'Anderson', 'who', 'cleverly', 'splashy', 'touches', 'bringing', 'tv', 'jingle', 'singers', 'right', 'frame', 'smiling', 'Colgate', 'smiles', 'sing', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'even', 'Evelyn', 'credit', 'Anderson', 'not', 'demonize', 'alcoholic', 'Kelly', 'instead', 'gently', 'why', 'nothing', 'truly', 'black', 'white', 'was', 'nominated', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Woody', 'Harrelsons', 'performances', 'are', 'absolutely', 'deserving', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'egregious', 'mistake', 'Gorgeously', 'shot', 'highly', 'evocative', 'era', 'Prize', 'winner', 'Defiance', 'Iowa', 'captivating', 'honest', 'glimpse', 'true', 'story', 'struggles', 'successes', 'American', 'family']",N/A

Run, no wait... get in a car, a fast car, and drive as fast as you can- ignoring all traffic signs and signals- away from this movie. It's terrible mix of pure treacle and bitter hostility. Julianne Moore plays a saint -nay- A GOD, who takes care of, I dunno, 100 kids? And she's as warm and kind and intelligent and loving and patient, etc., as any ascended being would be. Woody Harrelson plays... I don't even know. Knowing one of the kids wrote this is creepy because Woody's character, the father, is an angry, bitter drunk who is about as emotionally mature as your average 10 year old, and all the kids hate him. But then occasionally he has to come groveling for forgiveness and I think it's intended to elicit some sympathy, but it's so slapped on it seems pretty clear the author would have just preferred to damn the father altogether. Cree-py.And that's the thing, this movie isn't even honest. Moore's character at some point says ""I'm not a saint"". Yeah, right! That's just bad filmmaking. This movie is nothing but the 90 minute beatification of Moore's character (with some serious damning of the father thrown in), and rather than show the character as a real person, the character has to tell us she's a real person. Show, don't tell. Every second the woman is on screen she's second only to Jesus. When she said that ""saint"" line I laughed out loud because it was so ridiculous.This is a lousy movie.

The story of The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio is a terrific one, that you just couldn't make up. The book was written by one of a families ten children, about their mother and how she raised their entire family by winning sweepstakes, which were extremely popular in the 50's and 60's. The Ryan family was your typical suburban family, Kelly (Woody Harrelson) worked in a mill and spends most of his paycheck on alcohol. That leaves Evelyn (Julianna Moore) to raise 10 kids on almost no money. Evelyn was in advertising before she became a housewife and had a knack for writing slogans and jingles. As a result of her circumstances, she entered every contest she could find and surprisingly won a large number of them, despite the odds. She won the house they live in, as well as most of the appliances, and even a few cars they sold. The story was truly fantastic and a wonderful tribute to a woman, who in some ways could be considered a modern day working mother. Evelyn was played by Julianna Moore, who gives the performance of her life. Once again, an independent film is overlooked by the Academy, but had this been a major release, there is no doubt in my mind that Moore would have won the Oscar, she is really that good. A good portion of the story is focused on this extraordinary woman, but we do meet her husband and we see her kids at various ages and walks of live. It seems like a movie that could quickly fizzle out, but life is never slow or boring in the Kelly household. On a side note, the author of the book, Evelyn's oldest daughter really made a name for herself with this book and made a cameo at the end of the film. Unfortunately, her career was short lived, as she passed away shortly after the films release. The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio is the kind of tribute we'd all love to give our parents, but most of our parents didn't do the extraordinary things Evelyn Ryan did.

""The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio,"" directed by Jane Anderson and based on the true story as written by Terry Ryan, is that kind of a find.Today when we enter sweepstakes it is nearly always a matter of pure luck whether one wins or not. Perhaps we've gotten lazy? Or less creative? But back in the 1950's, when this story takes place, contests were won by the use of skill in writing jingles and verses and various marketing slogans. The prize winner who lives in the small, rural town of Defiance, Ohio, is Evelyn Ryan, played by Julianne Moore. She seems to win most every contest she enters, and being the mother of a boisterous brood of 10 and wife of an alcoholic husband (played by Woody Harrelson), apparently necessity is the mother of invention and creativity. Evelyn has a journalist's background that, as a woman of those times, she had to give up when she became a wife and mother. Her skills resurface, however, when she must support the household whilst hubby goes to drink.Recommended.
