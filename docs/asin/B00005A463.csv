All too often, making the wrong choice leads to more wrong choices.  Most of the time, the results are unfortunate, and sometimes they are perilous.  Rarely are the results as grisly as the fate that befell the Donner Party.As another reviewer noted, these were not bumbling fools done in by their own incompetence.  In fact, many members of the Donner Party were intelligent men &amp; women who really should have known better.  When sound decisions really counted, they consistently made the wrong choice, and these series of bad choices now means that most of us remember the Donner Party alone out of the thousands of wagon trains that went west in the 19th century.It is an awesome documentary that will not be easily forgotten.  The narrative &amp; the music only augment the eerie, depressing quality of the production.  Ultimately, it leaves all of us with that nagging question:  what would we have done in that same situation?",5,A stunning tale of bad choices,1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,1210,"['hard', 'find', 'words', 'describe', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'used', 'many', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'quot', 'haunting', 'mind-blowing', 'chilling', 'quot', 'come', 'mind.Suffice', 'say', 'everyone', 'had', 'moment', 'life', 'where', 'could', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'wrong', 'choice', 'too', 'often', 'making', 'wrong', 'choice', 'more', 'wrong', 'choices', 'Most', 'time', 'results', 'are', 'unfortunate', 'sometimes', 'are', 'perilous', 'Rarely', 'are', 'results', 'as', 'grisly', 'fate', 'befell', 'Donner', 'Party.As', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'were', 'not', 'bumbling', 'fools', 'done', 'own', 'incompetence', 'fact', 'many', 'members', 'Donner', 'Party', 'were', 'intelligent', 'men', 'amp', 'women', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'When', 'sound', 'decisions', 'really', 'counted', 'consistently', 'made', 'wrong', 'choice', 'series', 'bad', 'choices', 'now', 'most', 'remember', 'Donner', 'Party', 'alone', 'thousands', 'wagon', 'trains', 'went', 'west', '19th', 'century.It', 'awesome', 'documentary', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'easily', 'forgotten', 'narrative', 'amp', 'music', 'only', 'augment', 'eerie', 'depressing', 'quality', 'production', 'Ultimately', 'nagging', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'situation']",American Experience - The Donner Party: A Film by Ric Burns VHS

Olevano,"[6, 7]","I first saw &quot;The Donner Party&quot; during it's initial showing on PBS and it caused me to think about the question of what would I do under the same circumstances.  Also, I can in all honesty say that my sleap was not restful after first viewing this masterful documentary.  It proves that sometimes one does not need to visualy recreate gruesome acts to make us understand how horrifying they are.  Ric Burns through the use of voice over narratives, archival photos, and artist renderings really manages to place us in to the desperate situation that the donner party found themselves in.  So, I highly recommend that this wonderful docunmentary be veiwed by all who are interested in the history of the United States of America.  still, please be aware that this program does become very graphic in the description of the hardship that these doomed individuals indurred on their search for a better life for themselves and their famalies.",5,Riveting viewing,991699200,"06 5, 2001",2001,947,"['first', 'saw', 'quot', 'Donner', 'Party', 'quot', 'initial', 'showing', 'PBS', 'caused', 'think', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'circumstances', 'Also', 'can', 'honesty', 'say', 'sleap', 'was', 'not', 'restful', 'first', 'viewing', 'masterful', 'documentary', 'sometimes', 'one', 'not', 'need', 'visualy', 'recreate', 'gruesome', 'acts', 'make', 'understand', 'how', 'horrifying', 'are', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'use', 'voice', 'narratives', 'archival', 'photos', 'artist', 'renderings', 'really', 'place', 'desperate', 'situation', 'donner', 'party', 'found', 'So', 'highly', 'recommend', 'wonderful', 'docunmentary', 'be', 'veiwed', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'still', 'please', 'be', 'aware', 'program', 'become', 'very', 'graphic', 'description', 'hardship', 'doomed', 'individuals', 'indurred', 'search', 'better', 'life', 'famalies']",American Experience - The Donner Party: A Film by Ric Burns VHS

This story of the journey is inspiring. If pioneers could walk to California just think what we can do with out lives in this day and age.  It's a miracle what the human body and spirit can do.  The story ends with Virginia Reed whose family never ate flesh saying &quot;I have not wrote you half the trouble we've had, but I have wrote you enough to let you know what trouble is......We have got through with our lives.
