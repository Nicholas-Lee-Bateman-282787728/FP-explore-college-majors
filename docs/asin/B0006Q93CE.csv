871922,A1BMQA5PIZKU1P,B0006Q93CE,"Bryan ""Dragonboots""","[4, 5]","This was the name of the article I read in Hit Parader magazine when I first heard of Def Leppard in late 1981/early 1982.  I have been fan ever since I bought 'High N Dry.' at 12 years old.  I kept wondering why I like this movie.  Yeah the acting is kinda corny, the lip synching to the actual def lep songs is a little goofy, the low budget, etc.  And I know why I like it now: They are just a great band who have a very strong friendship.  How many other bands do you know of that kept their drummer after losing an arm and has been drumming with them 22 years later? That's damn cool to me.  Rick Allen is simply amazing in his bravery and determination.  Plus the music is great, another reason to watch the DVD.  All the band members are portrayed by relatively competent(but unknown) actors and it's easy to get into the movie and believe they are def leppard except for the actor who portrays Joe Elliot.  He kinda took me out of the movie cos he didn't really look like real Elliot or act/talk like him perhaps(not to mention the bad hair).  Other than that, the movie was great.  The actor who portrays Steve Clark impressed me the most and I wish they would've explored his problems more with his father, who as far as this movie showed, had a severe impact on his life up until his death in 1991.  Yes it's cheesy and low budget but if it has some great funny moments, dramatic moments and everything in between.  Great band.  Great movie.  It does what it should: It tells thier story.  It would have been interesting if they went up to present day and not stopped at approximately 1987 while on the Hysteria tour(which I've been to... simply awesome).  I wish the move whould've been longer than it's 89 minutes.  The DVD is the most bare bones of any DVD I've EVER seen but it's worth it.  The main menu has 'play' and 'chapter selection' and THAT'S IT.  No audio/subtitles, bonus features, trailers, nothing.  Kinda odd.  I hope they expand on this movie someday and perhaps get the real Leps involved.  Any fan of Def Lep should check out the DVD ""Classic albums: the making of Hysteria""... you will simply drool at all the bonus stuff on that.

871928,A10DQWWRKGQ6FY,B0006Q93CE,"Eric B. Gordon ""The greatest thing we ever ha...","[0, 0]","Talk about a truly unusual saga!  This is a re-enactment of the Def Leppard adventure, a saga that carries multiple turns of events typical among rock musicians and bands, yet made instantly distinctive by one crucial element, the story of drummer Rick Allen.Hysteria starts off with a dramatic re-creation the automobile accident on December 31, 1984 near the British province of Sheffield in which Rick lost his left arm.  He's in his Corvette with his girlfriend Miirium, tearing up the Motorway towards Sheffield, the recent Def Leppard hit ""Rock of Ages"" blaring on the stereo.  Rick starts racing a British vehicle.  Going around a swift turn, the Corvette crashes through the left-hand barrier and rolls over several times. . . As the title sequence runs, we, the viewers are taken back to 1977 in Sheffield, itself.  It's a typical workday, and Joe Elliot (performed by Orlando Seale) is working on a pencil-drawn poster while he waits for the steam whistle.  When it blows, he leaves; the name he's been penciling in is Deaf Leopard.  After a rough day at his factory job, Joe is unfortunate to leave just late enough to miss the bus home.  But, he hooks up with guitarist Pete Willis (Nick Bagnall), whose band called Atomic Mass just lost its singer and lead guitarist.  Joe meets Pete's drummer Tony Kenning (Bret Watson) and bassist Rick Savage (Adam MacDonald), also known as ""Sav"" and auditions as a guitarist; the three of them say they prefer his singing.  When he suggests the new name of Deaf Leopard, Tony suggests changing the spelling to make it ""rock harder.""  Pete rounds out the group with a friend named Steve Clark (Karl Geary) as the lead player.Nine months later, they're rehearsing at the local spoon factory, playing an early original song called ""Getcha Rocks Off,"" but Joe is dissatisfied with the output.  Tony's girlfriend enters the room and jealously coaxes Tony away from the rehearsal.  They get their first gig at a local school dance (at Steve's be-urging).  The gig is a triumph, except they only receive 8 quid per man, and Steve's hypercritical father refuses to compliment his son on the job he's done.  After the gig, the Def Leppard members are planning to cut a demonstration tape funded by Joe's parents, when Tony's girlfriend gives him an ultimatum, the band or his relationship, and he quits.  They replace him with fifteen-year-old Rick Allen (Tat Whalley) who demonstrates an uncanny knack behind the kit.  They record the demo, including an early version of ""Ridin' Into the Sun,"" and the gigs and attendance improve by leaps and bounds.  Backstage after a show one night, Joe spots promoter Peter Mensch (Dean McDermott) and recruits him as the band's manager.Def Leppard release their first album and embark on their first American tour.  The audiences are ecstatic, and the single ""Hello America"" becomes a minor hit, but the band spawns less-than-positive reviews.  Upon their return to Britain, they get a call from legendary producer Mutt Lange (Anthony Michael Hall).  The production of their second album, High 'n' Dry proves tedious and painstaking to the young musicians who aren't used to Mutt's meticulous standards.  But, they're delighted with the results, especially what will be their first significant hit, ""Bringing On the Heartbreak.""  On tour one night, Pete walks offstage in the middle of ""Heartbreak"" and helps himself to booze.  Backstage after the show, the lads fight it out, and the other four decide to kick Pete out.  Afterwards,  Joe and Sav are at a pub in Sheffield and hear a sizzling guitar solo in the background, performed by Pete's eventual replacement, Phil Collen (Esteban Powell).In the studio once again with Mutt Lange, Steve and Phil find they blend well, despite their sonic differences and Steve's internal doubts.  The third record, Pyromania is finished, and the reviews, in an about-face to the early ones, are decidedly positive; all the same, Steve is still plagued by his father's negative influince, which also fuels his own drinking problem.  The album goes on to spawn three gold singles.  The band tour for sixteen months after Pyromania's release and the success of the video for ""Photograph.""  Rick comes off the tour frustrated and desperate for a break.  Here is the instance of the gut-wrenching accident that would claim Rick's arm and, almost his life.In hospital after the accident, doctors have re-attached Rick's arm, but he's far from in the clear.  Not wanting to dismiss him, the rest of Def Leppard talk about what they can do while they wait for him to resurface.  They're optimistic, even though his condition is critical.  In the interim, Steve and Phil, who call themselves ""The Terror Twins"" frequent pubs and get drunk together (Steve is still trying to drink his father out of his head).  Peter Mensch persuades them to double-date two American models he knows.  The date is a success, and Steve begins a relationship with his match, Lorelei Shellist (Amber Valletta).  Meanwhile, Rick is now in worse shape physically, and the doctors set him to have his arm permanently removed.  He dreams about being able to drum again, but at least, he's going to make a full recovery.  Afterwards, Phil gets into trouble by driving his car clear up to the front of his house and buying a fifteen thousand quid watch; he resolves to quit drinking and tries coaxing Steve to do the same (unsuccessfully).In the meantime, Rick has expressed an interest in being able to play more with his feet and getting a set-up that would allow him to do so.  He reads a magazine article about how pilots can function with one arm, and his band mates present him with a new hybrid electronic kit with foot pedals at the left side.  At home, he's trying to practice on his new set and ends up embarrassing himself in front of the others by playing for them before he's ready.  Meanwhile, Steve's alcoholism worsens to the point when he ends up in the hospital just at the moment Mutt Lange turns up (after a leave of absence) to help them finish their fourth album.  In hospital, Joe and Lorelei learn that Steve's blood alcohol level far surpassed that of Led Zepplin's John Bonham.  In a rehabilitation home, Steve displays a complete lack of confidence in himself, claiming the other Def Leppard members ""should've backed a better horse.""  Meanwhile, Rick is improving on his new kit, but he still makes the odd mistake.  Lo and behold, Steve checks himself out of rehab, Joe dispatches Rick to find him, and he's discovered back at the pub.The film culminates with a sellout stadium concert, in which the band triumphantly takes the stage to perform ""Pour Some Sugar On Me,"" which had taken them years to perfect.  They don't miss a note or a beat, and the audience is applauding thunderously.  Before the closing credits role, it's revealed in captions how Rick returned to Def Leppard as a full-fledged drummer and Steve lost his life as a result of his drinking.When I first saw this film on VH1 (catching it at the point when Mutt lange was producing High 'n' Dry), I immediately caught a few inaccuracies.  For one thing, it's depicted that Rick Allen's severed arm remained re-attached for a matter of weeks after the car accident, not to mention that he was coherent throughout the whole tangled event.  However, Rick himself has said in interviews that his arm was only attached for 24 hours before infections set in, and he was out of it the whole time.  Not to mention, the incident with Steve's blood alcohol level exceeding that of John Bonham's took place after the events surrounding Rick's accident and the completion of the Hysteria record.  But, I also recognize how much more effective it was for the plot line to draw out the details of Rick's medical issues and reposition the moment of Steve's drinking incident. The real Steve Clark suffered bouts of stage fright when offstage, but he always performed sober and focused.  The film depicts his accelerated drinking as an aftereffect of the downtime after Rick's accident.  And, it was great the way they managed to make Tat Walley look as though he only had one arm.  In retrospect, I'm more than interested to know if Steve Clark's psyche was as damaged by his father, the way this plot depicted.But, one thing I am kind of sore about is the title of the story, Hysteria.  Nowhere in the film or the soundtrack is there any reference to the album title or the song of the same name.  There may not have been room for it, but it would've been fitting.  That's the real reason I give it four out of five stars.",4,A Story Like No Other,1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,8588,"['Talk', 'truly', 'unusual', 'saga', 're-enactment', 'Def', 'Leppard', 'adventure',

As the viewer you follow Deaf Leopard on their rise from a bunch of kooky kids that like to polka to a full fledged rock supergroup that sings songs like Photograph and Rocket(their tribute to Roger Clemens, little known fact there kids). They're english, so their teeth aren't really healthy and they have accents. One of the guys, Steve Clark, drinks like a freakin fish. He's like me in Dallas getting blitzed like Tony Eason against the 85 bears. He drinks himself to death by the end. The drummer gets in a car accident and loses one of his two arms. You'd think the band would fire him at that point because there is no way in hell the guy could play drums with one ahm. Slap me in the calf with a trout Tom, he does it. I was so inspired that I went out and started a deaf Leapord cover band called Hard of hearing cougar. I was on lead vocals because I'm hot and can shake my butt like a martini on acid. I put on an over the top show. Burns was on keyboards even though they didn't have a keyboard player. Well, we added keyboards to their songs and crowd quickly realized how great Deaf Leopard could've been. JAbs played bass and lead guitar at the same time. How, I don't know, it's jabs. Kroll tucked one arm in his shirt and played drums. Brennan managed the band and booked us in places like Sokol Hall and Chucky Cheeses(he knew the manager). He made us huge money and only kept 3%. That's why Brennan should manage your band.Anyway, this movie is the sixth greatest ever.

871933,A6NA5T5XTW1CY,B0006Q93CE,Susan B. Wallcraft,"[0, 0]","This is overall a very accurate, gripping dramatization of the first nine years of Def Leppard's existence. Casting is absolutely superb; everyone really looks like who they're supposed to. There are certain distance shots of the group onstage where I honestly forgot it wasn't the real band. The actors did a fantastic job mimicking the mannerisms and attitudes, and the costume designer deserves a medal for duplicating real outfits any Def Lep fan will recognize. One thing in this movie that really stood out to me is how well they portrayed Steve Clark's alcoholism. I knew he had a terrible problem with it, but to see it so realistically acted out is enough to bring you to tears. Certain events have been fictionalized/tweaked, but it gets the general point across (e.g. in tweaking: Rick Allen didn't drum completely by himself for the first couple of shows after his accident; there was a backup drummer briefly. E.g. in fictionalizing: again with Rick, they show him using drugs just before his accident. I may be misinformed but I have never ever heard that drugs were involved with the wreck).I feel obligated to offer a few words of caution, however. The case simply states it's rated R for drug use, but there's more than that. There is some language (f word used twice, some ""white trash-talk,"" and some crude comments). If that sort of thing bothers you, all you need is a good memory and a mute button handy. One scene involves some groupies and the guys at a hotel; thankfully, it is right at the end of a scene segment [in other words, if you press the scene skip button right as ""Photograph"" is finishing, the DVD will skip the nasty scene entirely and take you to the next part without leaving anything else out. I promise, you're not missing anything if you do that). My other caution is they do show Rick's arm lying on the ground after the accident. You might want to have your younger Def Lep fans close their eyes.Those detractors aside, this is a great movie that I have watched multiple times already and will continue to do so for many years. It's a real treat to get to see the story of one of rock's greatest bands lovingly represented on the big screen.

871934,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B0006Q93CE,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 0]","From my understanding this was a made for television movie therefore it probably didn't have a big budget and shouldn't be taken as anything bigger than it is. It covers successful British band Def Leppard's career through the ups and down. The film begins on December 31st 1984 with drummer Rick Allen's car accident and then moves back in time to the late 70's to the band's origins and from then on continues in linear fashion. Hysteria-The Story of Def Leppard really begins with a young Joe Elliot working in a factory. Elliot auditions for acquaintance Pete Willis' band to be a guitar player after Pete informs him that his band lost their singer/guitarist. However, after hearing Joe's take on Jimmy Hendrix's ""Purple Haze"" the members all want him in as a singer instead. Elliot then proposes the name ""Deaf Leopard"" which was then styled as Def Leppard. From then on the ban records their first demo in 1979 and eventually their first album ""On Through The Night"". It follows the band's early tours, further recordings, relationships and so on. It shows Def Lepp recovering from Allen's accident and amputation of his left arm which came as a shock. Of course fans know that they came back bigger than they were with the Hysteria album and did just what producer Mutt Lang wanted, a Heavy-Metal ""Thriller"", an album with 7 hit singles. Hysteria is a story of rock `n' roll, success, excess, courage facing adversity and most importantly a story of determination.I must that I enjoyed Hysteria: The Def Leppard Story for what it is. It offers a great look at the band's early and formative years, from their inception, recruiting band members, playing clubs, touring and recording with ""Mutt"" Lang. It covers Def Leppard's rise to the top in a non-perfect but a respectable way. The actors selected have done a good job portraying the members of the band. I thought Anthony Michael Hall's performance as Robert ""Mutt"" Lang was probably the best out of all the actors. I like that Mutt Lang's strong input is displayed, he really deserves credit for the band's success. Tat Whalley as drummer Rick Allen was excellent, very believable and convincing.  The same with Karl Geary as Steve Clark, Whalley and Geary were the ones who got my attention every single time one of them were in a scene with someone else they stole it. Rick Savage was the one who got the less attention; we don't see a lot of him in the movie. Well we DO see him but he doesn't talk or gets nearly as much attention as other band members.For a TV movie based on a band that I love it's pretty good, nothing fancy but it was well executed. While Hysteria is maybe not 100% accurate, it is very much covers the story of the band in a reliable way.  Rick Allen's arm was not re-attached for weeks for instance (which is what the movie indicates) , that's a fact. Yet, Hysteria remains a great look at Leppard's career up to the Hysteria album. Someone else could have done the movie and get certain parts completely wrong. The only thing I'd like to point out is that the film covers the band's early days from the late 1970's through their rise to superstardom with albums like Pyromania and Hysteria. It actually stops at Hysteria, there's mention of the album even if the movie is named after that album although the band plays ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"". During the credits it mentions Steve Clark's passing in 1991 but doesn't go beyond that.I believe that you don't have to be a Def Leppard fan to enjoy the film although it certainly helps if you are. After all it shows through Rick Allen that with courage and determination anything is possible. To me it earns 4/5 stars.
