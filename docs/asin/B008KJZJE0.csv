If my wife had known that this was a another 'Christian movie' cut from the same cloth as 'Suing the Devil' (a movie so poor that even the legendary Malcolm McDowell couldn't save it)she would not have consented to ever place it in our DVD player. She even suggested that this type of movie should come with a warning, or at least some indication that it was a 'Christian movie.' Put it this way...a movie this  heavy-handed in its preachiness is sure to rapidly turn off almost if not all non-Christians. No one is going to be made interested in the faith from a movie this wooden and schmaltzy. We actually threw it out after about half-way. That being said, the cinematography was very good, and the scenes in natural settings looked pretty.  Michael, the main character, was played as well as possible given the frankly lame script. He was quite likable. The little stereotypical bratty over-talkative sister surprisingly brought the only humor we could find in the parts we watched. The basketball game action was convincing, although the cheerleaders and crowd were awfully generic. The Dad and Coach were made of cardboard throughout. I myself am fine with the biblical messages in the film, but the predictable, leaden approach to scripture was...well, I already said we threw the disk out. If you are a Christian and like boring, predictable flicks full of white-bread, straight from centeral casting unconvincing characters who are preaching to the choir, see this one again and again. If anything, movies like this will turn non-Christian off completely. Not a good thing.",1,"Very heavy handed, super preachy movie",1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1683,"['am', 'Christian', 'wife', 'agnostic', 'wanted', 'finish', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'wife', 'had', 'known', 'was', ""'Christian"", 'movie', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', ""'Suing"", 'Devil', 'movie', 'so', 'poor', 'even', 'legendary', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'consented', 'ever', 'place', 'DVD', 'player', 'even', 'suggested', 'type', 'movie', 'should', 'come', 'warning', 'least', 'indication', 'was', ""'Christian"", 'movie', 'Put', 'way', 'movie', 'heavy-handed', 'preachiness', 'sure', 'rapidly', 'turn', 'off', 'almost', 'not', 'non-Christians', 'one', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'interested', 'faith', 'movie', 'wooden', 'schmaltzy', 'actually', 'threw', 'out', 'half-way', 'being', 'said', 'cinematography', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'natural', 'settings', 'looked', 'pretty', 'Michael', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'played', 'as', 'well', 'possible', 'given', 'frankly', 'lame', 'script', 'was', 'quite', 'likable', 'little', 'stereotypical', 'bratty', 'over-talkative', 'sister', 'surprisingly', 'brought', 'only', 'humor', 'could', 'find', 'parts', 'watched', 'basketball', 'game', 'action', 'was', 'convincing', 'cheerleaders', 'crowd', 'were', 'awfully', 'generic', 'Dad', 'Coach', 'were', 'made', 'cardboard', 'am', 'fine', 'biblical', 'messages', 'film', 'predictable', 'leaden', 'approach', 'scripture', 'was', 'well', 'already', 'said', 'threw', 'disk', 'out', 'are', 'Christian', 'boring', 'predictable', 'flicks', 'full', 'white-bread', 'straight', 'centeral', 'casting', 'unconvincing', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'preaching', 'choir', 'see', 'one', 'again', 'again', 'anything', 'movies', 'will', 'turn', 'non-Christian', 'off', 'completely', 'Not', 'good', 'thing']",N/A

Acting is wooden and stiff in many scenes, the music is mundane and many of the scenes are unconvincing. I think a 3 star would be generous for this film, The redeeming quality in my mind is the look into the mind and heart of a pastor's kid. Very nice component of this movie. Still I had to ask my wife to keep watching and she did, but I only did that because it is a faith based film and we are believers. Still we were disappointed by the production quality overall.This movie carries a message for believers to trust in God when you don't like the life you have. I don't agree with the reviewer who said it had no gospel in it...it has a strong faith message that shows how young people can make hard choices for God when life is not smooth.

Parker ""Author""","[1, 2]","I really wanted to like this one, but the unrealistic portrayal of high school basketball was too much for me to overcome. I had to force myself to watch to the end. The acting for the most part was good by the principals, but there were some less than stellar performances by others. Ben Davies was almost enough to hold this movie together by himself--but not quite. The main problem I had was watching a basketball team with only eight players coached by a man who talked more like a cheerleader than a coach. If they had been a poor team, I'd have been comfortable with it, but watching them work their way through to the state championship was more than I could suspend my disbelief. A four-on-four practice scrimmage is not going to prepare a team to win the state championship. In real life, teams would bring up sophomores and maybe freshmen to pad their roster so they'd have enough players for a full scrimmage and a bench. To make things worse, they hosted all of the tournament games in their small home gym, including the state championship. Tournaments are held in large neutral gyms, not in crackerbox local high school gyms. I realize that they saved a lot on expenses by shooting in on location, but I think it was a big mistake. And lastly, the new kid in town, who was billed to be some kind of a hotshot, was a lame basketball player. I think I had more serious basketball skills at fifty-five years of age than his character portrayed. A pretty good Christian message was somewhat lost by ignoring some small details which anyone associated with basketball could have helped avoid.  Here is the perfect example of where a movie producer should have gotten input from others before shooting to avoid story issues. People can stomach a sermon if it's delivered via a good story. I'm afraid this one was not palatable for me.",3,Not a totally bad film but grates on the nerves of an ex basketball coach,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,1843,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'one', 'unrealistic', 'portrayal', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'overcome', 'had', 'force', 'watch', 'end', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'good', 'principals', 'were', 'less', 'stellar', 'performances', 'others', 'Ben', 'Davies', 'was', 'almost', 'enough', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'not', 'quite', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'watching', 'basketball', 'team', 'only', 'eight', 'players', 'coached', 'man', 'who', 'talked', 'more', 'cheerleader', 'coach', 'had', 'been', 'poor', 'team', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'work', 'way', 'state', 'championship', 'was', 'more', 'could', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'four-on-four', 'practice', 'scrimmage', 'not', 'going', 'prepare', 'team', 'win', 'state', 'championship', 'real', 'life', 'teams', 'would', 'bring', 'up', 'sophomores', 'maybe', 'freshmen', 'pad', 'roster', ""'d"", 'have', 'enough', 'players', 'full', 'scrimmage', 'bench', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'hosted', 'tournament', 'games', 'small', 'home', 'gym', 'including', 'state', 'championship', 'Tournaments', 'are', 'held', 'large', 'neutral', 'gyms', 'not', 'crackerbox', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'gyms', 'realize', 'saved', 'lot', 'expenses', 'shooting', 'location', 'think', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'lastly', 'new', 'kid', 'town', 'who', 'was', 'billed', 'be', 'kind', 'hotshot', 'was', 'lame', 'basketball', 'player', 'think', 'had', 'more', 'serious', 'basketball', 'skills', 'fifty-five', 'years', 'age', 'character', 'portrayed', 'A', 'pretty', 'good', 'Christian', 'message', 'was', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'ignoring', 'small', 'details', 'anyone', 'associated', 'basketball', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'avoid', 'Here', 'perfect', 'example', 'where', 'movie', 'producer', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'input', 'others', 'shooting', 'avoid', 'story', 'issues', 'People', 'can', 'stomach', 'sermon', 'delivered', 'good', 'story', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'palatable']",N/A
1569377,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B008KJZJE0,Doug Park,"[9, 10]","Minister Alex Evans (denomination unidentified, but obviously mainline, fairly conservative Protestant) and his family move from Colorado to a small southern town that is still reeling from the suicide of high school basketball star Chase Green the year before. Michael, the minister's son, takes Chase's place on the team, begins a relationship with Chase's decidedly non-Christian girlfriend, Jasmine, and is antagonized by Chase's angry, grief-stricken, star center brother, Lucas.NEW HOPE is, of course, from R-Squared Productions, a Christian film company, so there is little or no sex, gore, violence, profanity, etc. Not rated, but would almost certainly be a ""PG"": Tame stuff, but not completely Hallmark in all respects--it does show a condom in one scene. This film is certainly open to criticism for being sappy and cornballish in many spots, but it's not-so in many others. NEW HOPE honestly, originally, and often quite humorously addresses many pertinent issues: e.g., the well-behaved but still somewhat ambivalent Michael's observation, ""It's not Christianity that's flawed: It's Christians.""Though slow-moving, NEW HOPE's storyline is taut and focused, and there is some real tension here along with genuine elements of surprise in a number of places. Still, the transformations that take place toward the end are both predictable and unbelievable.Some good acting and dialogue, as well as some that's quite lame. Interestingly enough, the teenagers' script is more realistic than the adults': I've seen better depictions of adolescent life, but I've also seen much worse. The interactions between Jasmine and Michael are particularly engaging and poignant. Also worthy of mention is Michael's little sister, Faith, about 10 and always being told to go get ready for bed: ""Mom, don't take this the wrong way, but have you HEARD how boring you and Dad are?!""Unfortunately (since he's so central), NEW HOPE's most wooden character is the minister himself. It is, of course, hard to characterize a Fundamentalist preacher who, regardless of whether or not we all subscribe to his theology, is a decent fellow and neither a thundering lunatic nor a closet pervert; thus, many of Evans's lines are the usual ""We ALL have our struggles,"" blah-blah-blah. Nevertheless, he does have his realer moments: ""Hey, I'm a preacher! This 'God' stuff is all I know.""Though many will find the patriarchal, mostly white, Middle American culture alienating, it's noteworthy that the moms in this film are far more convincing  than the dads. Chase's grieving mother, finely played by Dodie Brown, is probably the most fully-realized character here.NEW HOPE's mood and atmosphere remind me of the ""After-School Specials"" I used to watch as a boy back in the '70s and '80s. {That may sound insulting, but it's not so-intended}. Daryl Wolgemuth's fine soundtrack really enhances this production. Yes, a lot of it's ""Christian rock,"" but it's some of the best that I've heard, and the use of subtle instrumentals is just fantastic. The general cinematography and use of scenery are also quite good.This production will obviously resonate with many Christian audiences, and non-Christians with some tolerance for basic, unpoliticized Christian views should not find it too preachy or dogmatic. It's full of ""lessons"" about God and life, most of which are given via Pastor Evans, and there is an obvious intent to evangelize to the audience, but again, it's not too ""in-yer-face"" in these respects.",4,Was Unsure Beforehand but Really Enjoyed this Film,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,3488,"['Minister', 'Alex', 'Evans', 'denomination', 'unidentified', 'obviously', 'mainline', 'fairly', 'conservative', 'Protestant', 'family', 'move', 'Colorado', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'still', 'reeling', 'suicide', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'star', 'Chase', 'Green', 'year', 'before', 'Michael', 'minister', 'son', 'Chase', 'place', 'team', 'relationship', 'Chase', 'decidedly', 'non-Christian', 'girlfriend', 'Jasmine', 'antagonized', 'Chase', 'angry', 'grief-stricken', 'star', 'center', 'brother', 'Lucas.NEW', 'HOPE', 'course', 'R-Squared', 'Productions', 'Christian', 'film', 'company', 'little', 'sex', 'gore', 'violence', 'profanity', 'etc', 'Not', 'rated', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'be', 'PG', 'Tame', 'stuff', 'not', 'completely', 'Hallmark', 'respects', 'show', 'condom', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'certainly', 'open', 'criticism', 'being', 'sappy', 'cornballish', 'many', 'spots', 'not-so', 'many', 'others', 'NEW', 'HOPE', 'honestly', 'originally', 'often', 'quite', 'humorously', 'many', 'pertinent', 'issues', 'e.g.', 'well-behaved', 'still', 'somewhat', 'ambivalent', 'Michael', 'observation', 'not', 'Christianity', 'flawed', 'Christians', 'slow-moving', 'NEW', 'HOPE', 'storyline', 'taut', 'focused', 'real', 'tension', 'here', 'along', 'genuine', 'elements', 'surprise', 'number', 'places', 'Still', 'transformations', 'take', 'place', 'end', 'are', 'predictable', 'unbelievable.Some', 'good', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'quite', 'lame', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'teenagers', 'script', 'more', 'realistic', 'adults', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'depictions', 'adolescent', 'life', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'much', 'worse', 'interactions', 'Jasmine', 'Michael', 'are', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'poignant', 'Also', 'worthy', 'mention', 'Michael', 'little', 'sister', 'Faith', 'about', '10', 'always', 'being', 'told', 'go', 'get', 'ready', 'bed', 'Mom', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'wrong', 'way', 'have', 'HEARD', 'how', 'boring', 'Dad', 'are', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'central', 'NEW', 'HOPE', 'most', 'wooden', 'character', 'minister', 'course', 'hard', 'characterize', 'Fundamentalist', 'preacher', 'who', 'regardless', 'not', 'subscribe', 'theology', 'decent', 'fellow', 'thundering', 'lunatic', 'closet', 'pervert', 'thus', 'many', 'Evans', 'lines', 'are', 'usual', 'have', 'struggles', 'blah-blah-blah', 'Nevertheless', 'have', 'realer', 'moments', 'Hey', ""'m"", 'preacher', ""'God"", 'stuff', 'know', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'patriarchal', 'mostly', 'white', 'Middle', 'American', 'culture', 'alienating', 'noteworthy', 'moms', 'film', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'convincing', 'dads', 'Chase', 'grieving', 'mother', 'finely', 'played', 'Dodie', 'Brown', 'probably', 'most', 'fully-realized', 'character', 'here.NEW', 'HOPE', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'remind', 'After-School', 'Specials', 'used', 'watch', 'boy', 'back', ""'70s"", ""'80s"", 'may', 'sound', 'insulting', 'not', 'so-intended', 'Daryl', 'Wolgemuth', 'fine', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'production', 'Yes', 'lot', 'Christian', 'rock', 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'use', 'subtle', 'instrumentals', 'just', 'fantastic', 'general', 'cinematography', 'use', 'scenery', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good.This', 'production', 'will', 'obviously', 'resonate', 'many', 'Christian', 'audiences', 'non-Christians', 'tolerance', 'basic', 'unpoliticized', 'Christian', 'views', 'should', 'not', 'find', 'too', 'dogmatic', 'full', 'lessons', 'God', 'life', 'most', 'are', 'given', 'Pastor', 'Evans', 'obvious', 'intent', 'evangelize', 'audience', 'again', 'not', 'too', 'in-yer-face', 'respects']",N/A
