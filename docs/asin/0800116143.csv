Start with Working Girl, substitute New jersey for Staten Island, then take away the plot, the character development and just about everything else and you're left with the big hair and a plotless love story.  Jamie Gertz has had much better material to work with and Dylan McDermott's primary mode of expression in this role is a lazy smile.  Give the actor some dialogue! The ending was so contrived that there's no reward for sticking with this movie to the end.  You know how it will turn out just from reading the marquis.",1,An Insult to All,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,593,"['movie', 'was', 'equally', 'demeaning', 'actors', 'audience', 'Start', 'Working', 'Girl', 'substitute', 'New', 'jersey', 'Staten', 'Island', 'then', 'take', 'away', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'everything', 'else', ""'re"", 'left', 'big', 'hair', 'plotless', 'love', 'story', 'Jamie', 'Gertz', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'material', 'work', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'primary', 'mode', 'expression', 'role', 'lazy', 'smile', 'Give', 'actor', 'dialogue', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'contrived', 'reward', 'sticking', 'movie', 'end', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'just', 'reading', 'marquis']",Jersey Girl VHS
