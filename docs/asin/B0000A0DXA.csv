760912,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B0000A0DXA,David J. Brown,"[1, 2]","Okay, this was an impulse buy I must admit. I have a loyalty to filmmakers I like and Ghost House is headed up by two of my favs, Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi, so without saying I give them a tiny bit more slack. Which unfortunately lead me to theatrical viewing of the first Boogeyman and The Messengers, two totally underwhelming, unscary, unoriginal and just plain ineffective horror films, in The Messengers case it was all of the above until the conclusion where I got the added bonus of it being completely idiotic and predicatable. Anyway, I had seen the trailers for this flick and saw that it was in a different tone and that it was direct to DVD, which usually means it could be more risky and not really be close to what the original was.Low and behold I got a slasher movie. A real one. Old fashioned, not jokey, no self-references and filled with some brutal violence. Some of the violence is brutal just for the sake of gore but some of it works in getting under you skin(literally in one scene involving maggots).This is no great film, mind you. I can only slightly recommend it to folks who already like slasher films and will enjoy any slasher on some level(Yes, I'm talking to you, all you Happy Birthday To Me fans). This film is good enough for what it intended to do. I commend it for not having too many redicules jump scares involving cats, birds, or friends creeping in from the left or right of the frame. The director holds back on certain early scenes and makes the ultra violence towards the end more effective. Also, I must commend the acting. It's pretty good and the young and older actors give the characters some depth that probably wasn't on the page. I was shocked. These direct to video/sequel/teen-slice 'em ups rarely ever have competent acting, let alone a group of unknowns. No problems there, for once.My main gripes with the flick are of two schools: some of the gore was just showy and ineffective, and the reveal of the killer is totally predictable within the first fifteen minutes, though they do throw in some red herrings here and there, one of which was the great and now cult famous Tobin Bell. *SPOILERS* Slasher films are famous for having surprise guest killers under their chosen masks and this one is no different. The problem is the second you meet the main character's brother and he's being released from the fear clinic you know that most likely he is the new Boogeyman, as it were, and he is one because his childhood fear of the Boogeyman made him that way. On the plus side, the actor playing the brother is so good, and he has no corny grandiose 'the cat's outta the bag' killer speeches at the end when he's revealed. A little predictable, but done well.Finally, I'm no prude when it comes to gore, but I'm also aware of how gore can be used effectively and how it can't. This film has a couple real squirmers in the gore department, but then it overdoes it and it's less effective in the film, and more of a show case for some good and gross effects. The opening scene is a good example of this. When the two main characters witness their father's death we see him being stabbed through a dollhouse window, but then we see his actual intestines fall out. Not necessary and takes some of the impact out of the scene. More mood and sound effects and utter shock coming from the little girl would've been better. There's one more scene like this involving a heart. It all just feels like good effects and not-so-good story telling.Check it out, but if you actually liked the original Boogeyman(until I looked on this site I had no clue such people existed) you might not like this one. It's in a different genre. It's not supernatural and it's fairly brutal. The main difference between the films is that Boogeyman failed its supernatural genre, and Boogeyman 2 lives up to it's slasher genre's bretheren.

But compared to Starr and Lommel's sequel, the first film is a masterpiece.It's six months later, and Lacey (Lommel's wife Suzanna Love, an heiress to the DuPont fortune) has gone to California to see her old college friend Bonnie (The Princess and the Call Girl's Shannah Hall), now an actress married to struggling art-film director Mickey Lombard (Lommel). After the two of them hear Lacey's story, Bonnie puts together a party of some of Hollywood's sleaziest personages, with the hope that one or more of them will recognize Lacey's story for what it is--a bangup movie plot. The inevitable occurs, but while actresses are campaigning to play Lacey (who doesn't like the idea at all) and producers are constantly on the phone looking for backers, Bonnie and Mickey's faithful, if somewhat creepy, butler Joseph (Shoto von Douglas, who never appeared in another film) stumbles upon the piece of the mirror that Lacey keeps with her. Once again, the inevitable occurs.As you may have guessed from the first part of that synopsis, the majority of the first half of this movie consists of footage from the first flick. It's a device that I find spectacularly annoying, and I have never once seen a movie in which it's used that's been anything more than execrable. This is no exception. The worst part of it is, however, that the conceit Lommel works with here can be used well (look at Wes Craven's final Nightmare on Elm Street movie, which takes the same conceit and applies some great twists to it), but no one involved with this flick had the remotest intentions of trying to do anything worthwhile with it at all. At least that makes Lommel's character in the film, an art-flick director doing everything he can to avoid being sucked into the Hollywood exploitation machine, amusingly ironic. Doesn't help his incredible lack of acting talent, however, which is shared by the entire cast. And the murders are even sillier than they were in the first movie.

Lommel has made some terrible films (Don't believe me? Check out ""Revenge of the Stolen Stars."") but this one is among his very worst. (As a caution, there are two films of this name and this review is for the 1983 release, not the 2007 movie.) It is highly derivative and highly boring. The script is awful, and the acting worse. Lommel stars against Suzanna Love as Lacey, a young woman haunted by her past and the gruesome deaths of her family and friends.While the film is sadistic, it is also incredibly plodding and fails to chill on any level. While the film allegedly stars John Carradine, be advised that he is in it as a dour psychiatrist for maybe five minutes. It's a shame, as he turns in the best performance in the film (not that that's saying much.) The plot revolves around a house where murders occurred years ago. There's a mirror that witnessed the killings and little pieces of it possess people and objects to bring more death and destruction. I will not bore you with details, but the following is a non-exhaustive list of murderously possessed items: scissors, electric hedge trimmers, a window frame (not the glass part, you understand,) a medicine cabinet, a can of shaving cream, and my personal favorite, a toothbrush. Bonus points go to Lommel for the most ridiculously deadly French kiss in history.The ""Exorcist"" and ""Amityville Horror"" influences are obvious, but the film is clearly not in the same league. The film centers on B-movie personalities in Hollywood, where Lacey confronts her past while the cast gets thinned out. The film has poor sound and lots of annoying directorial choices and camera work (the closeups of children's toys in the dark, etc.) that utterly fail to create suspense or horror. The film winds down with a jarringly quick, but wholly ridiculous conclusion involving a convertible in the desert with three unlikeable cast members in it. I couldn't help but think of the parallel sequences in ""Manos, The Hands of Fate,"" but ""Manos"" is a much more enjoyable movie.Even John Carradine's most devoted fans may want to steer clear of ""Boogeyman 2,"" surely one of the most trying horror films of his career to endure.

ISaw(pun intended) the ending coming very early on in this film (joke directed at Tobin Bell's presence in the film).We are asked to constantly believe in the totally unbelievable in this film.  It was way beyond the ""suspension of disbelief"" I can typically muster up for these kinds of films.  The acting is cartoonish and overwrought, the direction is clumsy and lacks any real suspense, the death knell for any so-called thriller, and the storyline is just preposterous which I guess I have run down here to be fair.The story opens with a young brother and sister witnessing the slaying of their parent in a VERY unnecessarily graphic manner and totally out of sync with the spirit of the first film.  The kids are then sent off to an asylum to help them cope with what they saw.  The brother gets released, but the sister who got over things sooner re-enters when she realizes her brother doesn't seem to need her anymore as he once did and she begins seeing the images of the crazed killer again who was never caught and she believes is a real boogeyman.The rest plays out like any poor slasher sequel with phone lines cut, the teenagers trapped, all adults gone, and one lone survivor trying to tell her story, but no one believes her.  Did I forget to mention the ""slasher"" flick requirement?  These teenager still find time for some sex even though people are dropping like flies around them.This is just awful film making and all connected to this film should be embarrassed.  I can't imagine even the hardcore slasher film buffs enjoying this film, but I know some will.  To each his own, but this is definitely a thumbs down for me.",1,Close to the worse film I have ever seen!,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,2811,"['film', 'so', 'bad', 'English', 'language', ""'m"", 'not', 'blind', 'solely', 'opinion', 'maybe', 'even', 'many', 'will', 'disagree.If', 'were', 'lay', 'film', 'Hits', 'Misses', 'format', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'lopsided', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'go', 'route', 'time.For', 'starters', 'film', 'NOT', 'real', 'sequel', 'other', 'passing', 'reference', 'first', 'film', 'everything', 'first', 'film', 'way', 'can', 'appreciate', 'sequel', 'go', 'off', 'own', 'direction', 'likeWhite', 'Noise', '2did', 'one', 'so', 'far', 'afield', 'first', 'really', 'ticked', 'even', 'use', 'dreaded', 'number', '2', 'title', 'was', 'few', 'actually', 'got', 'mild', 'kick', 'original.This', 'story', 'nothing', 'do', 'actual', 'boogeyman', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'serial', 'killer', 'Anyone', 'reviews', 'how', 'little', 'regard', 'hold', 'slasher', 'films', 'simply', 'little', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'added', 'genre', 'horror', 'film.Boogeymanwas', 'clever', 'monster', 'film', 'ghost', 'story', 'elements', 'thrown', 'film', 'strictly', 'slasher', 'film', 'terrible', 'mystery', 'tale', 'boot', 'ISaw', 'pun', 'intended', 'ending', 'coming', 'very', 'early', 'film', 'joke', 'directed', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'presence', 'film', '.We', 'are', 'asked', 'constantly', 'believe', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'can', 'typically', 'muster', 'up', 'kinds', 'films', 'acting', 'cartoonish', 'overwrought', 'direction', 'clumsy', 'real', 'suspense', 'death', 'knell', 'so-called', 'thriller', 'storyline', 'just', 'preposterous', 'guess', 'have', 'run', 'down', 'here', 'be', 'fair.The', 'story', 'young', 'brother', 'sister', 'witnessing', 'slaying', 'parent', 'VERY', 'unnecessarily', 'graphic', 'manner', 'totally', 'sync', 'spirit', 'first', 'film', 'kids', 'are', 'then', 'sent', 'off', 'asylum', 'help', 'cope', 'what', 'saw', 'brother', 'released', 'sister', 'who', 'got', 'things', 'sooner', 're-enters', 'when', 'brother', ""n't"", 'seem', 'need', 'anymore', 'once', 'did', 'seeing', 'images', 'crazed', 'killer', 'again', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'real', 'boogeyman.The', 'rest', 'out', 'poor', 'slasher', 'sequel', 'phone', 'lines', 'cut', 'teenagers', 'trapped', 'adults', 'gone', 'one', 'lone', 'survivor', 'trying', 'tell', 'story', 'one', 'Did', 'forget', 'mention', 'slasher', 'flick', 'requirement', 'teenager', 'still', 'find', 'time', 'sex', 'even', 'people', 'are', 'dropping', 'flies', 'them.This', 'just', 'awful', 'film', 'making', 'connected', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'even', 'hardcore', 'slasher', 'film', 'buffs', 'enjoying', 'film', 'know', 'will', 'own', 'definitely', 'thumbs', 'down']",N/A

Kept me entertained without dragging on or being too corny (which is the problem with a lot of horror movies nowadays).  The acting was pretty decent; for once there weren't any annoying corny side characters that have no real purpose other than adding to the body count.  The plot was interesting and unique I think-- centered on a group of kids in a psychiatry clinic whose fears ultimately lead them to their demise.  The ending wasn't a complete shocker but I wouldn't call it predictable necessarily... Guess it depends on the person.... Overall I say it's definitely a good DVD to pick up and enjoy on a quiet weekend in with the lights off.

760938,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0000A0DXA,Tim Janson,"[5, 6]","Boogeyman 2 is one of those rare sequels that is better than the original film. Granted, that's not saying much. The original Boogeyman was a rather bland spook-fest about a supernatural Boogeyman that lived in children's closets. Boogeyman 2 is as different from the original as Halloween 3: Season of the Witch was different from the other entries in that series. Now I'm going to do something that I've never done before in one of my DVD reviews and give readers a spoiler alert. I'm doing so because I think it's necessary to totally separate Boogeyman 2 from its predecessor.Two children, Henry and younger sister Laura, are traumatized when they see their parents murdered. Ten years later, Henry is leaving a mental hospital, apparently cured of his phobia of the dark and ready to move on with his life. However, his sister is still terrified of the Boogeyman and decides to voluntarily check into the same facility that treated her brother. There she meets a group of patients, all coping with various phobias such as bulimic Nicky who fears gaining weight, germophobe Paul, agoraphobic Darren, and Alison whose condition causes her to cut herself. The group is all under the care of Dr. Allen, played by Saw veteran Tobin Bell, and his assistant Dr. Jessica Ryan. Ryan is played by Renee O' Connor who is best known for her role As Gabrielle in Xena: Warrior Princess.Soon after Laura arrives, patients start to die. Laura is convinced that the Boogeyman has followed her to the hospital but Dr. Allen insists it's there is no Boogeyman and it's just her fear that she has to face. Boogeyman 2 has only the most tenuous tie to the first film as we learn that the main character was also treated by Dr. Allen. Now, here's the little spoiler alert and I think astute horror fans will figure this out very early on...This is not a supernatural tale like the first one but a good ol' fashioned slasher that is far more effective in its execution than the recent, over-hyped Hatchet.  Director Jeff Betancourt has succeeded in giving fans an 80's-style slasher film with a young, good looking cast, trapped in a creepy hospital, and stalked by a killer. The kills are gory, yet stylishly conceived and original. Each of the patients meets their end in a way that befits their particular fears.Danielle Savre is quite good in her performance as Laura. She's the requisite horror film heroine, terrified yet resourceful enough to stay alive. Tobin Bell only seems to have one expression no matter what role he's playing but he does bring a certain sinister quality to the film.The effects and gore are very well done, far better than one would expect from a direct-to-DVD sequel. While his was Betancourt's first directorial effort, he's not stranger to horror films, having worked as editor on The Grudge, The Grudge 2, When a Stranger Calls, and The Exorcism of Emily Rose.  He's learned his craft well. The scenery was dark, but not so dark that you could not see what was happening onscreen.Now, it's not all perfect. The film stretches the limits of logic quite a bit. We are to believe that this large facility is staffed by only two doctors and one nurse. There's no security, no maintenance, and the only orderly is fired near the beginning of the film. The doors are controlled through the phone system and when the phones go down, everyone is trapped inside. Somehow I'm thinking that a lack of emergency exits would not be up to building and fire safety codes. So yes, the film does ask the viewer to suspend a bit of belief. If you can do that, this turns out to be one gem of a slasher!",4,SUPERIOR TO THE ORIGINAL,1209081600,"04 25, 2008",2008,3602,"['Boogeyman', '2', 'one', 'rare', 'sequels', 'better', 'original', 'film', 'Granted', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'original', 'Boogeyman', 'was', 'rather', 'bland', 'spook-fest', 'supernatural', 'Boogeyman', 'lived', 'children', 'closets', 'Boogeyman', '2', 'as', 'different', 'original', 'Halloween', '3', 'Season', 'Witch', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'entries', 'series', 'Now', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'before', 'one', 'DVD', 'reviews', 'give', 'readers', 'spoiler', 'alert', ""'m"", 'doing', 'so', 'think', 'necessary', 'totally', 'separate', 'Boogeyman', '2', 'predecessor.Two', 'children', 'Henry', 'younger', 'sister', 'Laura', 'are', 'traumatized', 'when', 'see', 'parents', 'murdered', 'Ten', 'years', 'later', 'Henry', 'leaving', 'mental', 'hospital', 'apparently', 'cured', 'phobia', 'dark', 'ready', 'move', 'life', 'However', 'sister', 'still', 'terrified', 'Boogeyman', 'decides', 'voluntarily', 'check', 'same', 'facility', 'treated', 'brother', 'group', 'patients', 'coping', 'various', 'phobias', 'such', 'bulimic', 'Nicky', 'who', 'gaining', 'weight', 'germophobe', 'Paul', 'agoraphobic', 'Darren', 'Alison', 'condition', 'cut', 'group', 'care', 'Dr.', 'Allen', 'played', 'Saw', 'veteran', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'assistant', 'Dr.', 'Jessica', 'Ryan', 'Ryan', 'played', 'Renee', 'O', 'Connor', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Gabrielle', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess.Soon', 'Laura', 'arrives', 'patients', 'start', 'die', 'Laura', 'convinced', 'Boogeyman', 'followed', 'hospital', 'Dr.', 'Allen', 'Boogeyman', 'just', 'fear', 'face', 'Boogeyman', '2', 'only', 'most', 'tenuous', 'tie', 'first', 'film', 'learn', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'treated', 'Dr.', 'Allen', 'Now', 'here', 'little', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'think', 'astute', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'very', 'early', 'not', 'supernatural', 'tale', 'first', 'one', 'good', 'ol', 'fashioned', 'slasher', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'execution', 'recent', 'over-hyped', 'Hatchet', 'Director', 'Jeff', 'Betancourt', 'succeeded', 'giving', 'fans', ""80's-style"", 'slasher', 'film', 'young', 'good', 'looking', 'cast', 'trapped', 'creepy', 'hospital', 'stalked', 'killer', 'kills', 'are', 'gory', 'yet', 'stylishly', 'conceived', 'original', 'patients', 'meets', 'end', 'way', 'particular', 'fears.Danielle', 'Savre', 'quite', 'good', 'performance', 'Laura', 'requisite', 'horror', 'film', 'heroine', 'terrified', 'yet', 'resourceful', 'enough', 'stay', 'alive', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'expression', 'matter', 'what', 'role', 'playing', 'bring', 'certain', 'sinister', 'quality', 'film.The', 'effects', 'gore', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'far', 'better', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'direct-to-DVD', 'sequel', 'was', 'Betancourt', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'not', 'stranger', 'horror', 'films', 'having', 'worked', 'editor', 'Grudge', 'Grudge', '2', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'learned', 'craft', 'well', 'scenery', 'was', 'dark', 'not', 'so', 'dark', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'onscreen.Now', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'limits', 'logic', 'quite', 'bit', 'are', 'believe', 'large', 'facility', 'staffed', 'only', 'two', 'doctors', 'one', 'nurse', 'security', 'maintenance', 'only', 'orderly', 'fired', 'beginning', 'film', 'doors', 'are', 'controlled', 'phone', 'system', 'when', 'phones', 'go', 'down', 'everyone', 'trapped', 'inside', 'Somehow', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'lack', 'emergency', 'exits', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'building', 'fire', 'safety', 'codes', 'So', 'yes', 'film', 'ask', 'viewer', 'suspend', 'bit', 'belief', 'can', 'do', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'gem', 'slasher']",N/A
