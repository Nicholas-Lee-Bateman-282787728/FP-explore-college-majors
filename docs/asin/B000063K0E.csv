It's just not one of those movies they play on cable or satellite TV.Definitely a fun and sexy thriller,5,Great Story,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,163,"['had', 'seen', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'movies', 'play', 'cable', 'satellite', 'TV.Definitely', 'fun', 'sexy', 'thriller']",N/A
695392,A206JYZTUXTFAS,B000063K0E,Jay Holder,"[3, 3]","One hell of a  thriller with more twists than a cork screw.  A well crafted movie with a fine cast.  Not drenched in dark photography like many of today`s films. A good marriage between the music and the film, in that it complemented rather than obstructed the story.  Music by Graeme Revell, released in 2002.",5,top notch thriller,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,310,"['One', 'hell', 'thriller', 'more', 'twists', 'cork', 'screw', 'well', 'crafted', 'movie', 'fine', 'cast', 'Not', 'drenched', 'dark', 'photography', 'many', 'today', 's', 'films', 'good', 'marriage', 'music', 'film', 'complemented', 'rather', 'obstructed', 'story', 'Music', 'Graeme', 'Revell', 'released', '2002']",N/A

I enjoyed this movie as different to the others and is worth buying and keeping. James Belushi plays an excellent part and suits him down to his toes. I enjoyed the other shows of hes and I must say some roles make you feel your right there with him.,5,Something different,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",2010,319,"['movie', 'interesting', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'different', 'others', 'worth', 'buying', 'keeping', 'James', 'Belushi', 'excellent', 'part', 'suits', 'down', 'toes', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'shows', 'hes', 'must', 'say', 'roles', 'make', 'feel', 'right', 'there']",N/A
