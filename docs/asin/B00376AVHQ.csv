Lail,"[7, 8]","Fire From BelowI think this must be one of those really cheap made for TV movies that the SYFY channel airs.All I saw when I reserved this thing was a short description, and that it starred Kevin Sorbo (Hercules Series). I figured that if it had Sorbo it couldn't be all bad. It wasn't all bad, just mostly bad.To put it in a nutshell, this movies was so full of holes, I felt a draft while watching it.The whole premise was stupid from the start. Corporate miners strike a pure lithium source which proceeds to shoot out and kill them all. The fireball follows people around until it vaporizes them, then it goes away itself.There is the chance that the deposit will explode in a nuclear type blast, but Sorbo, his girlfriend, and ex-girlfriend still have time to talk about stupid stuff. The girlfriend is jealous of the Ex, and the Ex just wanted to hear an apology from Sorbo.Two of the team gets trapped in the caverns and are making their way to the surface, only they are going at about ten steps a minute. I suppose they had to shuffle their feet because the set wasn't big enough.Sorbo goes into the caverns with two soldiers to blow up the lithium vein with some kind of fancy bomb. He takes the EX along. He tells his girlfriend that she couldn't go because it wasn't her field of expertise. The Ex didn't do anything but stop walking at one point and talk more stupid stuff. She got her apology from Sorbo so all was well: Except they still had not set the charges. This is all she did. The only reason that she was in this particular story line was the idiotic apology.The bombs go off, the Earth is saved, blah, blah, blah.In case you are wondering, there was nothing on TV that I wanted to watch so I wasted 89 minutes of my life watching this instead.Oh the agony! :p",1,What Was I Thinking? :p,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,1783,"['Fire', 'BelowI', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'really', 'cheap', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'SYFY', 'channel', 'airs.All', 'saw', 'when', 'reserved', 'thing', 'was', 'short', 'description', 'starred', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Hercules', 'Series', 'figured', 'had', 'Sorbo', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'bad', 'just', 'mostly', 'bad.To', 'put', 'nutshell', 'movies', 'was', 'so', 'full', 'holes', 'felt', 'draft', 'watching', 'it.The', 'whole', 'premise', 'was', 'stupid', 'start', 'Corporate', 'miners', 'strike', 'pure', 'lithium', 'source', 'shoot', 'out', 'kill', 'fireball', 'people', 'then', 'away', 'chance', 'deposit', 'will', 'explode', 'nuclear', 'type', 'blast', 'Sorbo', 'girlfriend', 'ex-girlfriend', 'still', 'have', 'time', 'talk', 'stupid', 'stuff', 'girlfriend', 'jealous', 'Ex', 'Ex', 'just', 'wanted', 'hear', 'apology', 'Sorbo.Two', 'team', 'trapped', 'caverns', 'are', 'making', 'way', 'surface', 'only', 'are', 'going', 'about', 'ten', 'steps', 'minute', 'suppose', 'had', 'shuffle', 'feet', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough.Sorbo', 'caverns', 'two', 'soldiers', 'blow', 'up', 'lithium', 'vein', 'kind', 'fancy', 'bomb', 'EX', 'along', 'girlfriend', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'was', ""n't"", 'field', 'expertise', 'Ex', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'stop', 'walking', 'one', 'point', 'talk', 'more', 'stupid', 'stuff', 'got', 'apology', 'Sorbo', 'was', 'well', 'still', 'had', 'not', 'set', 'charges', 'did', 'only', 'reason', 'was', 'particular', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'idiotic', 'apology.The', 'bombs', 'go', 'off', 'Earth', 'saved', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah.In', 'case', 'are', 'wondering', 'was', 'nothing', 'TV', 'wanted', 'watch', 'so', 'wasted', '89', 'minutes', 'life', 'watching', 'instead.Oh', 'agony', 'p']",Fire From Below

The screenplay features the usual cadre of clich&eacute;d characters, sprouting the same kind of drivel that you've heard a thousand times before.  Complementing the uninspired screenplay, are some weak acting performances and unrealistic looking sets.  The finish seems relatively exciting, only because what preceded, is so dull and ridiculous.  Be sure not to confuse this film with Steven Seagal'sFire Down Below(1998).Seismologist Jake Denning (Kevin Sorbo) and his fianc&eacute; Dr. Kerrie Watkins (Maeghan Albach) are on their way to a lake for a little relaxation, however a destructive phenomenon occurring in the area ruins their plans.  A dangerous lithium isotope has been released from a mine, and has somehow become ""animated"".  The threat is manifested as floating balls of light, and moving shafts of flame that take flight, causing fires, death, and destruction, as the substance seeks water.  If this sounds completely whacko, the plot is actually dumber than it sounds.Denning and Watkins are detained by the Government, and begin working with the military, after everyone in a town near the lake is found dead.  Drake Industries, a mining company is responsible for releasing the unstable ""L6 lithium"", which could possible cause a nuclear reaction.  Despite the dangers, slimy Taylor Drake (Matthew Tompkins) the head of the company, is focused solely on profits, and is held back only by his scientific advisor Dr. Reign Palmer (Alex Meneses), his advisor and liaison with the Government.  Eventually it is determined that the detonation of explosives deep in the mine will make things safe, as matters wind up in a rather predictable fashion.If you appreciate bad disaster flicks, Fire Down Below may just be a winner.  The premise is silly, and the awful dialog leads to some pretty terrible acting performances.  It's perfect for the Sy Fy Channel, where it has already been featured.  Perhaps you can catch it there before you decide to buy.
