Now I knew nothing going into this about the flick other than it was about sharks eating people. That was enough for her so my brother came over [he loves horrible movies as well] and we put it in. turns out it was exactly what we thought it would be, your average Asylum movie.A group of people are abducted from their normal lives only to end up bound and standing in front of a billionaire with a pool behind them. Turns out this man wants them to play a game, and each game involves killer sharks ready to tear into these people. What was the reason behind all of this, well they will have to play to find out, and to make it off of the island.This was your typical Asylum flick which is to say it has bad all over it but that is also the charm of it. The sharks and kills are cool but silly which made my cuz love it even more. The acting is horrible for the most part; there are a few good performances. The story is cool although it has been done before just this adds sharks. Writers H. Perry Horton [who has written many Asylum films including a few more shark ones] and Liz Adams [who has done a few Asylum flicks herself] have done much better on their own so it is surprising that this wasn&#8217;t as good as other efforts.The film was directed by Christopher Ray who has directed some other Asylum films including two other shark ones. I think he kept things moving nicely but he has made better films. You get behind the scenes and a bunch of Asylum trailers as is the norm. if you like bad movies like I do or shark flicks like my little cuz then this may be for you.",3,AVERAGE ASYLUM FLICK,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,1697,"['SHARK', 'WEEKMy', 'little', 'cuz', 'huge', 'fan', 'shark', 'movies', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Asylum', 'movies', 'was', 'perfect', 'Now', 'knew', 'nothing', 'going', 'flick', 'other', 'was', 'sharks', 'eating', 'people', 'was', 'enough', 'so', 'brother', 'came', 'over', 'horrible', 'movies', 'well', ']', 'put', 'out', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'average', 'Asylum', 'movie.A', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'abducted', 'normal', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'bound', 'standing', 'front', 'billionaire', 'pool', 'out', 'man', 'play', 'game', 'game', 'killer', 'sharks', 'ready', 'tear', 'people', 'What', 'was', 'reason', 'well', 'will', 'have', 'play', 'find', 'out', 'make', 'island.This', 'was', 'typical', 'Asylum', 'flick', 'say', 'bad', 'also', 'charm', 'sharks', 'kills', 'are', 'cool', 'silly', 'made', 'cuz', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'acting', 'horrible', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'performances', 'story', 'cool', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'just', 'sharks', 'Writers', 'H.', 'Perry', 'Horton', '[', 'who', 'written', 'many', 'Asylum', 'films', 'including', 'few', 'more', 'shark', 'ones', ']', 'Liz', 'Adams', '[', 'who', 'done', 'few', 'Asylum', 'flicks', ']', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'own', 'surprising', 'wasn', '8217', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'efforts.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Christopher', 'Ray', 'who', 'directed', 'other', 'Asylum', 'films', 'including', 'two', 'other', 'shark', 'ones', 'think', 'kept', 'things', 'moving', 'nicely', 'made', 'better', 'films', 'get', 'scenes', 'bunch', 'Asylum', 'trailers', 'norm', 'like', 'bad', 'movies', 'do', 'shark', 'flicks', 'little', 'cuz', 'then', 'may', 'be']",Shark Week

1544929,A2UQF0BCL4I75O,B00834JR0Y,POD JAWS,"[2, 4]","There are several so-called facts that surround the eight characters in this horrific predicament and one thing that was actually quite cool was that they use these facts to fight these sharks as they pick them off one by one. In some ways you could totally tell this was directed by Christopher Ray (Director of Mega Shark vs. Crocosaurus and 2 Headed Shark Attack) because, well.... for one when the sharks attack not only do they use the same sound effects in a few sequences but they show them charging at the people and taking bites out of the non-existing human (well only in the CGI shot they used) The sharks do look really cheesy but at least they made them look accurate you see they used several kinds of sharks in this movie (everything from two month old sharks to the fearsome great white shark) and tell you the truth I did feel a genuine suspense when they entered the great whites domain.... something about being a wicked small boat in the ocean where a twenty something foot great white is stalking you just made me feel uncomfortable or maybe it was just some of the CGI they used in that scene... I don't know.Plot:  A mad man named Tiberon is hosting a deadly game of life in death and the eight contestants quickly find out that they are being hunted by no man, but a series of sharks (new ones attack everyday for seven days hence the title.) Soon everything is considered a weapon and they have been promised a single better weapon every time they kill a shark. Can anyone survive a week filled with a lot of resting and deadly sharks!Review: now when I say a lot of resting I meant it. It seems every one or two scenes the people need to rest and I understand that it is to make character development but seriously they can't be that tired from walking a few hundred yards (I'll let it pass when after they fight a shark.) Now I will admit that the plot could've been better and in some ways it did seem like a bit of a rip off the Shark Night 3D cheese fest but unfortunately this film was worse than that. Some of the special effects were just bad. I mean did you see them jump off the edge of that rock (it looked like.... well... really bad CGI) There practically was no gore, just a lot of blood in the water where as  two headed shark attack people were getting torn apart like crazy. This time it does munch, munch, and bleed. Also some of the dialogue and lines in the movie where just ridiculous such as ""I already killed your who*e"" and then follows ""The who*es are replaceable"" There were a lot of problems I had with this movie Patrick Bergin wasn't one of them though. This movie made him look utterly psychotic. And don't even get me started on the climax it was like ""Oh we're running out of time and this movie still need an epic end"" and then it most likely followed with ""Just end it"" All in all this film felt overly rushed.Acting: Hey, it's David Arquette.... oh wait, no, it's just some guy named Frankie Cullen who was actually my favorite character... I wasn't sure if he was really part of the survival test or just another one of Tiberon's (Patrick Begin) Men. As goes for the acting... it was passableGore: None, just red water.... unless you count non-shark related deaths, that's when you get an exploded body and a stabbing.Bottom Line: It was definitely a little under decent sorry to say... I tried to take it seriously in the begging then just tried to have fun with it the other half but it never ended up being superb in any sort of way.Suggested MPAA: Rated R for violenceIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 3For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 2",2,Treats itself like a T.V.

1544930,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B00834JR0Y,S. Der,"[0, 1]","This movie is truly bad. The story doesn't make much sense, the acting is really bad, the CGI is really bad, and the ending was the worse of them all.I the story could had been good. A drug lord goes crazy after seeing his son die. Now he wants to kill everyone that was ever involved with the case to die. He kidnaps 8 people go to his island and put them in a survival game against different species of sharks every day. He would give the survivors little help ever day for killing a shark and moving on to the next day and event. What I didn't like about the story was the ending and how it was done, but more on that later.The acting in this movie is terrible. The actors are unrealistic and don't make me believe in what they say. The story was written were you don't really connect with each survivor or learn too much about them, so you don't really care for them when they die. Also, the actors don't read their lines that well and they are reading some really bad cheesy lines too. When they pretend to fight the CGI sharks, they don't look like they are really into it and it's hard to believe that they are actually fighting anything at all. Furthermore, they always look dumb and puzzle when a shark appears.Now for the CGI. This is one of those movies that doesn't have any good CGI at all. Yes, all the sharks do look like sharks, but you can tell very easy that it is a CGI creation and they don't look real at all. Some people that say bad about good CGI don't know anything until they see Shark Week's CGI, they will flip out and praise good CGI afterwards.Finally, I want to talk about the ending. This ending has to be one of the worse endings that I have ever seen. Yes, one person does make it and that person does get their revenge by ending the bad guys. What doesn't make sense is how he/she does it. You would think that a drug lord would have guns, body guards, or some kind of protection huh, well towards the end that just doesn't exist and it is thrown out of the window.  The drug is taken down in a ridiculous fashion and doesn't even put up a fight. Also, where the last fight was, just was too dumb.
