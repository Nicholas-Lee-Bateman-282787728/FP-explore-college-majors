This time it's  trying to save his girlfriend from her Uncle Gerald, who is after her  inheritance.OK, the plot isn't much, but Elvis looks good in some of the  outfits he wears in this picture. The songs are not much either, especially  the horrid rendition of &quot;Old MacDonald&quot;. The best songs are  &quot;Long Legged Girl&quot; and &quot;City By Night&quot;.At least this  is a picture in which I didn't cringe.

424506,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6304479670,trebe,"[0, 0]","You really don't expect a terrific plot in an Elvis film.  Typically the story is innocent, light, and fun fluff, without a hint of impropriety, however that doesn't seem to be the case in Double Trouble (1967), where Presley's love interest is a seventeen years old.  Spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.Presley is Guy Lambert, a singer in a rock band performing in England.  Unknown to Guy, Jill Conway (Annette Day) the girl he seems most interested in, is just seventeen.  The band is about to head over to Belgium, and Guy is looking to put some moves on Jill before he leaves, but the precocious youngster skips out of his flat, before he can commit any illegal acts.  After having a talk with Jill's uncle Gerald Waverly (John Williams), he discovers that she is just a few days short of her eighteenth birthday.Jill has marriage on her mind, and boards Guy's ship bound for Belgium.  On the trip smugglers slip some jewels the singer's luggage.  Upon reaching port, Guy and the band head to Bruges to perform in a club.  Predictably, Jill shows up there, and in no time at all is up in Guy's hotel room, spinning stories that her uncle is cruel to her.  Guy agrees to take Jill to Stockholm, while the buffoonish smugglers are hanging around, trying to recover their hidden loot.While in Antwerp, things take a dark turn.  Apparently Uncle Gerald has squandered away his niece's inheritance, and has sent someone to kill her.  Elvis has to break out his karate moves to defend Jill, as the attempted assassin ends up breaking his neck.  Guy is taken into police custody, where he is questioned by inspector de Groote (Leon Askin, General Burkhalter on Hogan's Heroes), as Gerald Waverly arrives on the scene.  The film's big finale features Guy's escape from the police station, and a lackluster chase through the town.Elvis Presley met his future wife Priscilla Wagner in 1959 when she was 14, and eventually married her in 1967 about a month after Double Trouble was released.  As Presley had himself been romantically involved with a minor, and was not yet married, his decision to participate in a film that resembles his real life situation is somewhat baffling.  The whole storyline involving a minor would be a little dodgy, even for an actor with no personal baggage, but given his history, Presley's involvement in such a badly written effort, is more than a little strange.Double Trouble is pretty much just for die hard Elvis fans.  The story is very weak, and the music isn't good either, as the King even sings Old MacDonald on the back of a truck.  Disappointingly, there are only two principal women in the film.  This remains Annette Day's only film, and while she may be handicapped because she is playing a minor, Day doesn't have the qualities you normally find in one of Elvis's leading ladies.  Yvonne Romain, who plays Gerald's girlfriend Claire Dunham, is the only other female with any major screen time.
