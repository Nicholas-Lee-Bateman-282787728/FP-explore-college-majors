1003910,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B000GG4Y6E,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[8, 8]","Money well spent. Even though I already owned all three I bought this to reduce the number of DVD cases on my shelves. All three movies are exceptional thrillers. ""Kiss the Girls"" involves women being kidnapped and tortured or killed and the attempt to find them by Forensic Detective Alex Cross played by Morgan Freeman once the victim played by Ashley Judd escapes. ""Along Came a Spider"" is about a young school girl being kidnapped and the investigation by Morgan Freeman that as Retired detective/Author Dr. Alex Cross follows it. It is a pretty good story that will keep you guessing who is involved. ""Double Jeopardy"" is about a woman played by Ashley Judd accused of killing her husband and going to prison and after she is out she finds he is alive, so she plots her revenge. Tommy Lee Jones plays her parole officer. I highly recommend this set. Good Quality DVDs with one normal size DVD case. Plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed these catch ""Bone Collector"", ""Murder of Crows"", and ""Shoot to Kill"". - C.
