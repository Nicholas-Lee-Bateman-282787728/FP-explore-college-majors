Also, the theme of spouse abuse was presented quite accurately, at least for many cases where the wife continues for years to believe that all will be better and her husband is finally changed and will never again hurt her, as he promises repeatedly. Add to that, self-esteem issues on the woman's part, desperately wanting and needing his love and admiration. Of course, personally, I ask the question why would she have 4 children? But, again, that is often how the illusion works in these kind of domestic situations.  I liked the way the movie covered many years over time and depicted changes in her as she matured and began to find herself (always a threat to the spouse abuse types).",4,Domestic abuse accurately portrayed,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,796,"['give', '3-1/2', 'star', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'really', 'actors', 'Also', 'theme', 'spouse', 'abuse', 'was', 'presented', 'quite', 'accurately', 'least', 'many', 'cases', 'where', 'wife', 'years', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'husband', 'finally', 'changed', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'hurt', 'repeatedly', 'Add', 'self-esteem', 'issues', 'woman', 'part', 'desperately', 'wanting', 'needing', 'love', 'admiration', 'course', 'personally', 'ask', 'question', 'why', 'would', 'have', '4', 'children', 'again', 'often', 'how', 'illusion', 'kind', 'domestic', 'situations', 'liked', 'way', 'movie', 'covered', 'many', 'years', 'time', 'depicted', 'changes', 'matured', 'began', 'find', 'always', 'threat', 'spouse', 'types']",N/A
