1326399,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B0035JHYFW,California Dreaming,"[0, 3]","OK.  So I'm surely not the target audience here.  But really, if I want to hear someone sit around and complain all day long, I'll tune into Rush Limbaugh.  At least I might be updated on some current events.  Or hear about what an awful job that our president is doing.But this &#34;film&#34; is beyond a sapfest, and it is beyond manipulative.  Granted, it was on TV -- I didn't change the channel because I was thinking about something far more important, such as watching paint dry -- and so therefore it was &#34;free,&#34; but still, don't you owe it to your audience more than just trying to induce tears?I give nothing away when I say one of these actors (they used to be called &#34;actresses;&#34; what happened there?) gets cancer.  Chaos ensues and tears fall.  But one thing that really fell:  the remote control when I almost fell asleep while &#34;watching.&#34;Which reminds me:  I've got to tell my wife to change the channel back to the ID network after she's done watching something on either the Hallmark or Lifetime Networks.  That way, I can see something interesting, such as the reenactment of a nasty home invasion.  Otherwise, I might just be forced into watching some so-called uplifting material like this.",2,I've Got a Secret -- It Stinks!,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,1234,"['OK', ""'m"", 'surely', 'not', 'target', 'audience', 'here', 'really', 'want', 'hear', 'someone', 'sit', 'complain', 'day', 'long', ""'ll"", 'tune', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'least', 'might', 'be', 'updated', 'current', 'events', 'hear', 'what', 'awful', 'job', 'president', 'doing.But', '34', 'film', '34', 'sapfest', 'manipulative', 'Granted', 'was', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'channel', 'was', 'thinking', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'such', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'so', 'was', '34', 'free', '34', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'owe', 'audience', 'more', 'just', 'trying', 'induce', 'tears', 'give', 'nothing', 'away', 'when', 'say', 'one', 'actors', 'used', 'be', 'called', '34', 'actresses', '34', 'what', 'happened', 'cancer', 'Chaos', 'ensues', 'tears', 'fall', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'fell', 'remote', 'control', 'when', 'almost', 'fell', 'asleep', '34', 'watching.', '34', 'Which', ""'ve"", 'got', 'tell', 'wife', 'change', 'channel', 'back', 'ID', 'network', 'done', 'watching', 'something', 'Hallmark', 'Lifetime', 'Networks', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'something', 'interesting', 'such', 'reenactment', 'nasty', 'home', 'invasion', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'forced', 'watching', 'so-called', 'uplifting', 'material']",N/A
