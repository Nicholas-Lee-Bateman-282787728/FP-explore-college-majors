Though the premise of glorifying drugs put me off at first, the show is first rate, I can watch them repeatedly, and bought the seasons 1-2 off a e-you-know-who reseller, and have season 3 on pre-order, and I just can't wait to see how season 4 unfolds in July.  My only problems with the seasons 1-2 was that on season 1 so far, while using my blue ray player to play, it had a couple areas that wouldn't play, like the disc was damaged, but when slipped into a regular progressive scan player, then no problem, which is strange, I usually use the blue ray player for badly scratched discs and such, so maybe its my equipment or there is a peculiar quirk associated, maybe the e-auctioner got ahold of a bunch of reject discs, that strangely work excellent in a regular dvd player.The actors/actresses in this show, including Bryan Cranston, they are really performing a show I can watch repeatedly, not every show I can do that for me.",5,"Excellent, surprisingly something I have enjoyed...",1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,1070,"['am', 'really', 'enjoying', 'show', 'having', 'got', 'watching', 're-runs', 'season', 'one', 'got', 'interested', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'hooked', 'premise', 'glorifying', 'drugs', 'put', 'off', 'first', 'show', 'first', 'rate', 'can', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'bought', 'seasons', '1-2', 'e-you-know-who', 'reseller', 'have', 'season', '3', 'pre-order', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'season', '4', 'unfolds', 'July', 'only', 'problems', 'seasons', '1-2', 'was', 'season', '1', 'so', 'far', 'using', 'blue', 'ray', 'player', 'play', 'had', 'couple', 'areas', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'disc', 'was', 'damaged', 'when', 'slipped', 'regular', 'progressive', 'scan', 'player', 'then', 'problem', 'strange', 'usually', 'use', 'blue', 'ray', 'player', 'badly', 'scratched', 'discs', 'such', 'so', 'maybe', 'equipment', 'peculiar', 'quirk', 'associated', 'maybe', 'e-auctioner', 'got', 'ahold', 'bunch', 'reject', 'discs', 'strangely', 'work', 'excellent', 'regular', 'dvd', 'player.The', 'actors/actresses', 'show', 'including', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'are', 'really', 'performing', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'not', 'show', 'can', 'do']",N/A

He was home for a mini family reunion this past summer and described this series to the family. We have all subsequently become Breaking Bad junkies, having watched the first three series in marathon sessions on weekends. Despite the darker elements of the show, it is the best drama available on so many levels. The writing simply doesn't get any better, as one doesn't know what to expect from one moment or one episode to the next. Wonderful characters, terrific acting, and plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat; beautifully scripted, acted and filmed. Simply the best TV drama available. Not a family show, and not to everyone's taste, but I find it to be the most compelling drama since The Sopranos. Two thumbs up for a show that brings together ALL of the elements of truly fine and gripping drama. Such depth and complexity to the characters and the story line that one is constantly amazed by the evolution of the series.",5,Amazing and Compelling Drama.,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,1077,"['oldest', 'son', 'lives', 'Tokyo', 'method', 'keeping', 'up', 'American', 'entertainment', 'what', 'can', 'find', 'iTunes', 'was', 'home', 'mini', 'family', 'reunion', 'past', 'summer', 'described', 'series', 'family', 'have', 'subsequently', 'become', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'junkies', 'having', 'watched', 'first', 'three', 'series', 'marathon', 'sessions', 'weekends', 'darker', 'elements', 'show', 'best', 'drama', 'available', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'writing', 'simply', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'one', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'one', 'moment', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'Wonderful', 'characters', 'terrific', 'acting', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'beautifully', 'scripted', 'acted', 'filmed', 'Simply', 'best', 'TV', 'drama', 'available', 'Not', 'family', 'show', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'compelling', 'drama', 'Sopranos', 'Two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'show', 'together', 'ALL', 'elements', 'truly', 'fine', 'gripping', 'drama', 'Such', 'depth', 'complexity', 'characters', 'story', 'line', 'one', 'constantly', 'amazed', 'evolution', 'series']",N/A

We recently bought seasons 1 & 2 so we could fill in the blanks. It is brilliant television!  We are hooked!  We can't wait for season 4 to find out what is going to happen next!  The characters are all brilliantly played, including the brothers, who never said a word.  Bryan Cranston is a master in this role . . . so different from his previous well-known role as the Dad in Malcolm in the Middle.
