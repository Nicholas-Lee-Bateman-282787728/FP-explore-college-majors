1435210,A1435P5AMCPB3X,B0050I2PQE,"Concerned One ""Thrashfan""","[2, 2]","I have always had a soft spot in my hard rock/metal collection for the Mark IV line up of Deep Purple. Coverdale and Huges I always thought were an excellent fit for the band and created some of the best music that the band had ever done (in MKIII and IV). Tommy Bolin was an excellent player, but as noted by many others, was plagued with health caused by substance use problems. When I learned that this collection was coming out and then saw what it offered when it was promoted on That Metal Show, I knew I had to have it, and put it on my wish list. For the price that it's going for now, it is a steal. The DVD show of Japan is good quality as others have noted, and the CD that comes with it features material from Japan and from Long Beach performances, nicely placed together on this disc. The documentary is informative and I think well done. My favorite part of this set is the 2 books that come with it. One book is of articles and promotional items of and around late mark II, Mark III and Mark IV items. The second is the ""Getting Tighter"" The story of MKIV Deep Purple, which tells the story of how it formed, the hype behind, the reality of it, and the demise. Overall and excellent DVD/CD set with good show, great documentary, and excellent packaging. A must have for any purple fan, and fascinating story.",5,Excellent addition to the Mark IV collection,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,1324,"['have', 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', 'hard', 'rock/metal', 'collection', 'Mark', 'IV', 'line', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'Coverdale', 'Huges', 'always', 'thought', 'were', 'excellent', 'fit', 'band', 'created', 'best', 'music', 'band', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'MKIII', 'IV', 'Tommy', 'Bolin', 'was', 'excellent', 'player', 'noted', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'plagued', 'health', 'caused', 'substance', 'use', 'problems', 'When', 'learned', 'collection', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'then', 'saw', 'what', 'offered', 'when', 'was', 'promoted', 'Metal', 'Show', 'knew', 'had', 'have', 'put', 'wish', 'list', 'price', 'going', 'now', 'steal', 'DVD', 'show', 'Japan', 'good', 'quality', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'CD', 'material', 'Japan', 'Long', 'Beach', 'performances', 'nicely', 'placed', 'together', 'disc', 'documentary', 'informative', 'think', 'well', 'done', 'favorite', 'part', 'set', '2', 'books', 'come', 'One', 'book', 'articles', 'promotional', 'items', 'late', 'mark', 'II', 'Mark', 'III', 'Mark', 'IV', 'items', 'second', 'Getting', 'Tighter', 'story', 'MKIV', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'story', 'how', 'formed', 'hype', 'reality', 'demise', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'DVD/CD', 'set', 'good', 'show', 'great', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'packaging', 'must', 'have', 'purple', 'fan', 'fascinating', 'story']",Phoenix Rising
1435211,A6H7FJYGLF0R4,B0050I2PQE,"David West ""David West""","[0, 0]","I have delayed watching this because I can remember going to the record shop, putting on the headphones, taking them off again and complaining &#34;This isn't Deep Purple.&#34; Stormbringer wasn't, either.It's a sad testimonial to a truly great band. There can be no finger-pointing here. Ritchie leaves after Stormbringer to make the dull Rainbow album. The band, Lord and Paice, struggle on and the rest is history.This document is a face-dipping into utter misery. Glenn Hughes looks and sounds like he never came off the trip he loudly declaims. On the other hand, the more sober Jon Lord has some more interesting points to make.What if he HAD left with Ritchie after Stormbringer?I saw Deep Purple at the Lewisham Odeon in 1974. Hat-wearing Ritchie stayed entirely to the right-hand side of the stage. Shapes of things to come...So why do I give this four stars? It's because of the comments, mostly Jon Lord's, that reveal such insight into this band's workings.For what it's worth, I saw this line-up at Wembley in 1976. I remember it for Coverdale saying &#34;Ian Gillan, he's not here&#34; after the audience yelled for Child in Time; I remember it for Tommy Bolin breaking a string in the middle of a solo and getting booed; I remember a miserable experience.Three years later, I experienced an even more miserable - and possibly life-threatening - event courtesy of Ritchie Blackmore.",4,Demise of a great band,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1396,"['have', 'delayed', 'watching', 'can', 'remember', 'going', 'record', 'shop', 'putting', 'headphones', 'taking', 'off', 'again', 'complaining', '34', ""n't"", 'Deep', 'Purple.', '34', 'Stormbringer', 'was', ""n't"", 'either.It', 'sad', 'testimonial', 'truly', 'great', 'band', 'can', 'be', 'finger-pointing', 'here', 'Ritchie', 'Stormbringer', 'make', 'dull', 'Rainbow', 'album', 'band', 'Lord', 'Paice', 'struggle', 'rest', 'history.This', 'document', 'face-dipping', 'utter', 'misery', 'Glenn', 'Hughes', 'never', 'came', 'off', 'trip', 'loudly', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'sober', 'Jon', 'Lord', 'more', 'interesting', 'points', 'make.What', 'HAD', 'left', 'Ritchie', 'Stormbringer', 'saw', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'Lewisham', 'Odeon', '1974', 'Hat-wearing', 'Ritchie', 'stayed', 'entirely', 'right-hand', 'side', 'stage', 'Shapes', 'things', 'come', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'comments', 'mostly', 'Jon', 'Lord', 'reveal', 'such', 'insight', 'band', 'workings.For', 'what', 'worth', 'saw', 'line-up', 'Wembley', '1976', 'remember', 'Coverdale', 'saying', '34', 'Ian', 'Gillan', 'not', 'here', '34', 'audience', 'yelled', 'Child', 'Time', 'remember', 'Tommy', 'Bolin', 'breaking', 'string', 'middle', 'solo', 'getting', 'booed', 'remember', 'miserable', 'experience.Three', 'years', 'later', 'experienced', 'even', 'more', 'miserable', 'possibly', 'life-threatening', 'event', 'courtesy', 'Ritchie', 'Blackmore']",Phoenix Rising
1435212,A2S1TT4ZIKGYND,B0050I2PQE,"herb ""nice name huh?""","[35, 35]","I won't recap all of what is on here as others will do that.For Deep Purple fans of this era it's a good product. You are essentially watching the demise of the band. What struck me on the concert footage was how good the quality was, because all I had ever seen was horrendous quality out -of -synch footage. The sound is really good and the picture is pretty good too.(Considering the era and previous versions) No synch issues. Sound and picture match up pretty well.Ian Paice is just awesome on this show! If only he would play like this now! He's always been great, but he was exceptionally so on ""Burn"", ""Come taste the band"", and ""Malice in Wonderland"". He is really aggressive on this show. David Coverdale sings really well here too. Glenn Hughes, even when high, is a more dynamic bassist than Roger Glover. The band's core members know the band is compromised and they are trying hard to compensate, but it is what it is....It's a band without a guitarist that night.As for Tommy Bolin? He is so bad on this show it is staggering to witness. Hard to believe he was capable of some of the great solos we all know from ""Spectrum"", ""Mind Transplant"", ""Whips and Roses"", ""Ebbits Field"" etc.Jon Lord covers many of the riffs due to Bolin's supposed ""hurt/numb arm"" during this show. Bolin's stage presence is almost non-existent in comparison to Blackmore too. Just a shame all around as he just doesnt seem vested in the music. One of the booklets has an interesting quote from Lord about how Blackmore maintained a level of virtuosity even when not playing his best, and really didn't fall below that certain level.  Yet he intimates that Bolin sunk deeply at times. I've seen Blackmore on bad nights and nothing compares to this feeble Bolin performance. You will get no satisfaction of Bolin's guitar playing from this footage.I saw this line-up in Providence Rhode Island later on during the US leg of the tour and Bolin was still only ""adequate"". Again he just seemed uninterested in what he was doing. I am a fan of his playing though, and we have do the great jazz fusion albums he played on!.... The guy could really play when he wanted to :)I recommend the product to anyone who likes this era of the band, and especially to anyone who likes the incredible new remaster/remix of ""Come Taste the Band"" (Remix by Kevin Shirley) This DVD has a cool booklet too, which features some pretty interesting quotes and information from some of the peripheral business people surrounding Purple. I like hearing the members discuss the band, so the documentary portion is great to have and does hold up to repeat viewings. I can't wait to see a one-star review from someone saying ""the concert is only 30 minutes man"" (Or, I didn't receive the item"")... :) :)When you put it into perspective how little there is on this era of the band, it's a pretty cool product. I'll give it 3 stars although I'd like to give it 4. The only thing that would have made it better would be Bolin's actual playing. Perhaps some other personnel being interviewed would have been nice too. Glenn Hughes put it best ""It's a postcard from that time frame of the band"". This DVD illustrates the turmoil within the band over the drug issues of Hughes & Bolin. If you realize that going in you will probably find it a satisfying product.  In summery it's a good DVD if you know what you are buying, but NOT a good place to start for someone new to Purple's output.Ps. There is an interesting but strange disclaimer at the end of the documentary stating that Glenn Hughes and Jon Lords comments revolving around the death of Patsy Collins are not necessarilly reflective of David Coverdales. Very strange. I wonder what Coverdale thought happened?????",3,If you know what you are buying it is worth having.,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,3729,"['wo', ""n't"", 'recap', 'what', 'here', 'others', 'will', 'do', 'that.For', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'fans', 'era', 'good', 'product', 'are', 'essentially', 'watching', 'demise', 'band', 'What', 'struck', 'concert', 'footage', 'was', 'how', 'good', 'quality', 'was', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'horrendous', 'quality', '-of', '-synch', 'footage', 'sound', 'really', 'good', 'picture', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'Considering', 'era', 'previous', 'versions', 'synch', 'issues', 'Sound', 'picture', 'match', 'up', 'pretty', 'well.Ian', 'Paice', 'just', 'awesome', 'show', 'only', 'would', 'play', 'now', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'so', 'Burn', 'Come', 'taste', 'band', 'Malice', 'Wonderland', 'really', 'aggressive', 'show', 'David', 'Coverdale', 'sings', 'really', 'well', 'here', 'too', 'Glenn', 'Hughes', 'even', 'when', 'high', 'more', 'dynamic', 'bassist', 'Roger', 'Glover', 'band', 'core', 'members', 'know', 'band', 'compromised', 'are', 'trying', 'hard', 'compensate', 'what', '.It', 'band', 'guitarist', 'Tommy', 'Bolin', 'so', 'bad', 'show', 'staggering', 'witness', 'Hard', 'believe', 'was', 'capable', 'great', 'solos', 'know', 'Spectrum', 'Mind', 'Transplant', 'Whips', 'Roses', 'Ebbits', 'Field', 'etc.Jon', 'Lord', 'many', 'riffs', 'due', 'Bolin', 'supposed', 'hurt/numb', 'arm', 'show', 'Bolin', 'stage', 'presence', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'comparison', 'Blackmore', 'too', 'Just', 'shame', 'all', 'around', 'just', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'vested', 'music', 'One', 'booklets', 'interesting', 'quote', 'Lord', 'how', 'Blackmore', 'maintained', 'level', 'virtuosity', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'playing', 'best', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'certain', 'level', 'Bolin', 'sunk', 'deeply', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Blackmore', 'bad', 'nights', 'nothing', 'feeble', 'Bolin', 'performance', 'will', 'get', 'satisfaction', 'Bolin', 'guitar', 'playing', 'footage.I', 'saw', 'line-up', 'Providence', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'later', 'US', 'leg', 'tour', 'Bolin', 'was', 'still', 'only', 'adequate', 'Again', 'just', 'seemed', 'uninterested', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'am', 'fan', 'playing', 'have', 'do', 'great', 'jazz', 'fusion', 'played', 'guy', 'could', 'really', 'play', 'when', 'wanted', 'recommend', 'product', 'anyone', 'who', 'era', 'band', 'especially', 'anyone', 'who', 'incredible', 'new', 'remaster/remix', 'Come', 'Taste', 'Band', 'Remix', 'Kevin', 'Shirley', 'DVD', 'cool', 'booklet', 'too', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'quotes', 'information', 'peripheral', 'business', 'people', 'surrounding', 'Purple', 'hearing', 'members', 'discuss', 'band', 'documentary', 'portion', 'great', 'have', 'hold', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'one-star', 'review', 'someone', 'saying', 'concert', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'man', 'Or', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'item', 'When', 'put', 'perspective', 'how', 'little', 'era', 'band', 'pretty', 'cool', 'product', ""'ll"", 'give', '3', 'stars', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', '4', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'Bolin', 'actual', 'playing', 'Perhaps', 'other', 'personnel', 'being', 'interviewed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'too', 'Glenn', 'Hughes', 'put', 'best', 'postcard', 'time', 'frame', 'band', 'DVD', 'turmoil', 'band', 'drug', 'issues', 'Hughes', 'Bolin', 'realize', 'going', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'satisfying', 'product', 'summery', 'good', 'DVD', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'buying', 'NOT', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'someone', 'new', 'Purple', 'output.Ps', 'interesting', 'strange', 'disclaimer', 'end', 'documentary', 'stating', 'Glenn', 'Hughes', 'Jon', 'Lords', 'comments', 'revolving', 'death', 'Patsy', 'Collins', 'are', 'not', 'necessarilly', 'reflective', 'David', 'Coverdales', 'Very', 'strange', 'wonder', 'what', 'Coverdale', 'thought', 'happened']",Phoenix Rising
1435213,A1PTMD3D645TI0,B0050I2PQE,"Richard C. Woodhouse ""woodhouse43""","[12, 12]","I have just watched the concert footage and the documentary for the second time. On those two parts I would give a 3 star rating. But I added another star for the remastered CD live tracks. Wow. There are some great moments culled from those two concerts from Japan and Long beach California. Dec 75 and Feb 76 respectively. The tracks from the California concert are especially good. Tommy Bolin was hampered by his drug use on the first concert mentioned. I've read various accounts of why he could barely play on that night, still the other four carry the load very well. And on the Long Beach tracks, they are all just smokin! Come taste the band has long been a favorite album of mine. Though its not considered a proper Deep Purple Album. Whatever! It blows away their previous record Stormbringer. And I say that as a total purple fanatic. The best part of the Stormbringer album was jon lord's keyboard solo on the song ""Highball shooter"". CTTB is molten Rock and It just gets better with time. The live tracks show what could have been if they did not self destruct. A shame really. But thankfully they reformed with the mark 2 line up and have made tons more great music since the 70's. There is a bootleg show of their's recorded on the same tour in Miami in early febuary 76. The sound isn't too great but its listenable and there are parts that are just even better. It would be great if they would remaster that show and put it out. You can check it out on YOu tube.

1435214,A2QLUJK62YAJSF,B0050I2PQE,Terry,"[1, 1]","Ironically, living in a small town in Wisconsin (I am 49), my first Purple album was a cut out of ""Come Taste the Band"", and I worked back from that.  I also haven't seen much of this footage at all, prior to this DVD.  So, while I was very familiar with the music, I wasn't with the particulars.  This package is an enlightening view into the changes of the band, and its ultimate demise.  The concert footage is the only Bolin era that is available, per Glenn Hughes.  The documentary is fascinating, in its candidness and also breadth of experience.  Be aware, the only two current contributors are Jon Lord and Glenn Hughes, so it is through their very honest eyes, but theirs only.  There may be some disagreement, especially the Indonesia incident, if you do research on your own.  It also ends up having a lot of Hughes' drug issues, and by association, Bolen's.  I did find it fascinating, and as my title says, sad.  A great band, in name, morphs into a different, but very skilled version (face it, Purple was never stagnant when it come to members).  Curious what could have happened, but it would have been different from MK II.
