1684322,A3UWYCISNFHO2X,B00H7KJTMG,albarino,"[5, 9]","Computer-generated dinosaurs are no longer as novel when Jurassic Park and Dinosaur wowed audiences awhile back. The ones in WWD are competently realized, to be sure, with solid attention to Paleontological details. But there is too little creativity in WWD, so the animation is largely ..... pedestrian (as in &#34;walking,&#34; get it?).In addition, to secure a family-friendly PG rating, the tooth-and-claw reality of herbivore vs. carnivore is underplayed. No blood is ever in evidence, despite the robust duels and attacks -- and conflict is easily resolved and glossed over. To be more candid about this would have given a greater drama to the dangers of seasonal survival and migrations. We get lots of butt and poop humor instead.And this leads me to the script and character voicing, two elements that sink this film for anyone but the most easily entertained. The writing is inane and out of synch with the lives the dinosaurs lead. Wise-cracking and adolescent rivalry are dolloped on as heavily as dinosaur droppings -- brontosaurus grade. This asphyxiates the pathos that underlines the story which in structure is comparable to Disney's &#34;The Lion King.&#34; There the comparison stops. The latter is an enduring classic; DWD evaporates as the credits roll.In addition, the film score is way too varied (& unmemorable) and often mismatches the action on the screen. Only 4 characters have voices and anthropological intelligence: Pachy, his older brother, Pachy's love interest Juniper, and an irritating pre-historic bird voiced by John Leguizimo. The later wearied me after less than 2 minutes on screen. Every other animal: dinosaurs, pre-historic birds and primitive mammals just squeak, squawk, roar and snarl and act out of instinct, instead of the intelligence written into the 4 voicing characters. This makes for an uneven and annoying film that is already hobbled by forced plot contrivances.",2,"a forgettable walk, tempting viewers to flee theaters",1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,1919,"['Computer-generated', 'dinosaurs', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'novel', 'when', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Dinosaur', 'wowed', 'audiences', 'awhile', 'back', 'ones', 'WWD', 'are', 'competently', 'realized', 'be', 'sure', 'solid', 'attention', 'Paleontological', 'details', 'too', 'little', 'creativity', 'WWD', 'animation', 'largely', '..', 'pedestrian', '34', 'walking', '34', 'get', '.In', 'addition', 'secure', 'family-friendly', 'PG', 'rating', 'tooth-and-claw', 'reality', 'herbivore', 'vs.', 'carnivore', 'underplayed', 'blood', 'ever', 'evidence', 'robust', 'duels', 'attacks', 'conflict', 'easily', 'resolved', 'glossed', 'over', 'be', 'more', 'candid', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'greater', 'drama', 'dangers', 'seasonal', 'survival', 'migrations', 'get', 'lots', 'butt', 'poop', 'humor', 'instead.And', 'script', 'character', 'voicing', 'two', 'elements', 'sink', 'film', 'anyone', 'most', 'easily', 'entertained', 'writing', 'inane', 'synch', 'lives', 'dinosaurs', 'lead', 'Wise-cracking', 'adolescent', 'rivalry', 'are', 'dolloped', 'as', 'heavily', 'dinosaur', 'droppings', 'brontosaurus', 'grade', 'pathos', 'story', 'structure', 'comparable', 'Disney', '34', 'Lion', 'King.', '34', 'comparison', 'latter', 'enduring', 'classic', 'DWD', 'credits', 'roll.In', 'addition', 'film', 'score', 'way', 'too', 'varied', 'unmemorable', 'often', 'action', 'screen', 'Only', '4', 'characters', 'have', 'voices', 'anthropological', 'intelligence', 'Pachy', 'older', 'brother', 'Pachy', 'love', 'interest', 'Juniper', 'irritating', 'pre-historic', 'bird', 'voiced', 'John', 'Leguizimo', 'later', 'wearied', 'less', '2', 'minutes', 'screen', 'other', 'animal', 'dinosaurs', 'pre-historic', 'birds', 'primitive', 'mammals', 'just', 'squeak', 'squawk', 'roar', 'snarl', 'act', 'instinct', 'instead', 'intelligence', 'written', '4', 'voicing', 'characters', 'uneven', 'annoying', 'film', 'already', 'hobbled', 'forced', 'plot', 'contrivances']",Walking With Dinosaurs

1684325,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00H7KJTMG,Andrew Ellington,"[25, 34]","Honestly, I&#8217;m not sure how it could get any worse than this.I was dragged to this film by my children who expressed no desire to see it until their friends invited them on a play date and I was then forced into chaperoning alongside a friend of mine who apparently got into this movie.  I don&#8217;t get it, and obviously everything has an audience, but this is one of those films that just don&#8217;t deserve one.  Pointless, unfunny, redundant, silly and boring; &#8216;Walking with Dinosaurs&#8217; is easily the worst film I&#8217;ve seen all year, and it&#8217;ll take an absolute miracle of crap for something to dethrone it.I said to my wife upon returning home that any film that opens with a rebel teenager opposed to fossil digging being talked to by a morphing bird and then taken on a journey in his mind to prehistoric times is just a complete a total joke.Please get me out of this theater!There are many problems with &#8216;Walking with Dinosaurs&#8217;, but that was a big one.  The film&#8217;s bookends are so obviously tacked on for some strange way of enticing a younger crowd.  Like making a straight up fictional documentary wouldn&#8217;t work.  Instead, we have some horrible acting and a ridiculous set up that leads to some dumb story about a runt who falls in love with a girl from a separate pack only to have his bullish brother take her out from under him and he has to come back and earn everyone&#8217;s respect because he&#8217;s obviously smarter than the rest of those dumb animals.  The entire movie being narrated by John Leguizamo trying his hand at a bizarre accent that resembles no notable ethnicity is bad enough, but the fact that these animals are all communicating telepathically (yes, their mouths never move) is a distraction and makes it pretty clear that this was originally intended to be a mere documentary with narration and was scrapped for this great idea (note the sarcasm).'Walking with Dinosaurs' somewhat plays out like an extended episode of 'Dino Dan' (some horrible kids show I'm forced to stomach every once and a while) and has these pointless pauses in the story to explain what each dinosaur is, how to pronounce their names and what their names mean.  It takes you out of the story (what story?) and further confirms that this movie was really supposed to be something else altogether and got butchered in production hell.The graphics are decent, but nothing noteworthy, and as I mentioned, the story is just plain dumb.  Follow that up with some terribly redundant jokes and awful delivery (it was funny the first time Alex, the bird, stopped talking to eat a bug&#8230;but the next thirty times were just unnecessary) and you have a film that is an absolute chore to get through.",1,Introducing the worst film of 2013&#8230;,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,2756,"['Honestly', '8217', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'could', 'get', 'worse', 'this.I', 'was', 'dragged', 'film', 'children', 'who', 'expressed', 'desire', 'see', 'friends', 'invited', 'play', 'date', 'was', 'then', 'forced', 'chaperoning', 'alongside', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'apparently', 'got', 'movie', 'don', '8217', 'get', 'obviously', 'everything', 'audience', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'don', '8217', 'deserve', 'one', 'Pointless', 'unfunny', 'redundant', 'silly', 'boring', '8216', 'Walking', 'Dinosaurs', '8217', 'easily', 'worst', 'film', '8217', 'seen', 'year', '8217', 'take', 'absolute', 'miracle', 'crap', 'something', 'dethrone', 'it.I', 'said', 'wife', 'returning', 'home', 'film', 'rebel', 'teenager', 'opposed', 'fossil', 'digging', 'being', 'talked', 'morphing', 'bird', 'then', 'taken', 'journey', 'mind', 'prehistoric', 'times', 'just', 'complete', 'total', 'joke.Please', 'get', 'theater', 'are', 'many', 'problems', '8216', 'Walking', 'Dinosaurs', '8217', 'was', 'big', 'one', 'film', '8217', 's', 'bookends', 'are', 'so', 'obviously', 'tacked', 'strange', 'way', 'enticing', 'younger', 'crowd', 'making', 'straight', 'up', 'fictional', 'documentary', 'wouldn', '8217', 't', 'work', 'Instead', 'have', 'horrible', 'acting', 'ridiculous', 'set', 'up', 'dumb', 'story', 'runt', 'who', 'love', 'girl', 'separate', 'pack', 'only', 'have', 'bullish', 'brother', 'take', 'come', 'back', 'earn', 'everyone', '8217', 'respect', '8217', 'obviously', 'smarter', 'rest', 'dumb', 'animals', 'entire', 'movie', 'being', 'narrated', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'trying', 'hand', 'bizarre', 'accent', 'notable', 'ethnicity', 'bad', 'enough', 'fact', 'animals', 'are', 'communicating', 'telepathically', 'yes', 'mouths', 'never', 'move', 'distraction', 'pretty', 'clear', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'mere', 'documentary', 'narration', 'was', 'scrapped', 'great', 'idea', 'note', 'sarcasm', ""'Walking"", 'Dinosaurs', 'somewhat', 'out', 'extended', 'episode', ""'Dino"", 'Dan', 'horrible', 'kids', 'show', ""'m"", 'forced', 'stomach', 'once', 'while', 'pointless', 'pauses', 'story', 'explain', 'what', 'dinosaur', 'how', 'pronounce', 'names', 'what', 'names', 'mean', 'story', 'what', 'story', 'further', 'confirms', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'supposed', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'altogether', 'got', 'butchered', 'production', 'hell.The', 'graphics', 'are', 'decent', 'nothing', 'noteworthy', 'mentioned', 'story', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'Follow', 'up', 'terribly', 'redundant', 'jokes', 'awful', 'delivery', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'time', 'Alex', 'bird', 'stopped', 'talking', 'eat', 'bug', '8230', 'next', 'thirty', 'times', 'were', 'just', 'unnecessary', 'have', 'film', 'absolute', 'chore', 'get']",Walking With Dinosaurs

1684338,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00H7KJTMG,FNDNreview,"[8, 13]","Neil Nightingale and Barry Cook direct the BBC Earth animated adventure, Walking with Dinosaurs, starring the voice of John Leguizamo as a bird named Alex (named after his Alexomis species) who takes viewers back to the Cretacious period (roughly 70 million years ago). There, he narrates and interacts with his dinosaur buddy, Patchi (Pachyrhinosaurus), voiced by Justin Long, who is initially the runt of his family. At an early age, Patchi learns about the various dinosaurs and birds living in his area (Alaska), along with the generalized theme: survival of the fittest.As winter approaches, his herd prepares to migrate south for the winter. While following the path to their destination, he and his older brother, Scowler (Skyler Stone), have a life-altering encounter with a pack of meat-eating Gorgosaurus (just imagine a small version of T-Rex). Eventually, they reconnect with their herd and Patchi establishes an emotional friendship with fellow herd member, Juniper (Tiya Sircar). In the days and years ahead, the once young group ascends into adulthood, facing various challenges, including a brotherly rivalry in regards to who will lead the herd into the future.Dinosaurs have really lost their flavor in the post Jurassic Park era. Naturally, there's been successful films featuring dinosaurs since the original Jurassic Park, like Journey to the Center of the Earth and Dinosaur, but when a film features animatronic dinosaurs chasing after humans, it really takes the thrill out of watching dinosaurs in any other environment. In their natural habitat, dinosaurs are limited to walking around and randomly eating anything and everything in sight &#8211; at least everything that isn't composed of dirt or rock. And, sadly &#8211; that's about all you'll get if you make the decision to watch this particular film.The Walking with Dinosaurs designation comes from the title of a popular BBC television documentary that aired in the United Kingdom and on the Discovery Channel in the United States right around the end of 1999. Just like the film's title, it follows a group of animated dinosaurs endlessly migrating from one place to another. There's so much walking going on over the course of this brief (not even 90 minutes) film that at times it will feel like it's moving just as slow as they are. Regardless, one would assume this film would be some kind of spin-off or continuation of the television miniseries. If you're thinking about watching this film under that assumption, you're in for some monumental disappointment.To be quite honest, this film would have been much more unique without all the voice-overs. There was really no need for a narrator, voice actors, or the absolutely out of place opening/final scene where Karl Urban makes a cameo has an uncle attempting to spend time with his niece and nephew. This brief appearance just felt completely wrong, largely because he was playing a happy-go-lucky character. He's currently well-established playing moody characters, like Judge Dredd and Dr. McCoy from Star Trek. Those aren't exactly the most cheerful roles, so when you see him being so happy and cheerful here, it's almost a shock to the system.Without a doubt, the voice over work absolutely ruins this film. John Leguizamo, who is a relatively recognizable face in several films these days, is also a pretty successful voice actor. His voice is so recognizable (mainly from voicing Sid the sloth in the Ice Age films) that you'd think whoever made the casting choices for this film would have been better off using someone less associated with prehistoric animated films. I'll admit, hearing his voice in this film bothered me to no end because of his prominent role in Ice Age. And, while we're on the subject of speaking roles, does anyone know why some dinosaurs in this film can talk and others can only grunt? If there's humor in that somewhere, it honestly escapes me.If you're wondering how the animation looks, believe me when I say there's no debating that it's the most impressive part of this film. These dinosaurs look more realistic than ever (at least in animated form) &#8211; but that's to be expected these days with multiple state-of-the-art animation studios around the world. Still, the $80 million budget that went into this film seems a bit excessive. It's hard to imagine actors like Justin Long or John Leguizamo commanding that much of a pay day. Based on the limited interest and documentary-style, it really makes you wonder how a studio justifies putting that much money into a movie like this...Overall, Walking with Dinosaurs is a film reserved for children with an interest in dinosaurs. To some young ones, there might be a moderate amount of entertainment here &#8211; and it does contain a few positive theme-based messages, like the importance of developing self-confidence and facing down criticism. However, this film is still mostly dull and unoriginal, focusing far too much on insignificant moments, like trying to make jokes about a dinosaur's tiny arms. I realize one of the film's goals was to introduce new dinosaurs, but they could have at least incorporated a few familiar faces, like T-Rex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, or Raptors. But, at the end of the day, you'll have to settle for impressive animation that's horribly overshadowed by annoying voice work, a poorly designed plot, unfamiliar dinosaurs, and characters that are completely mundane.GRADE:  D-FNDNreview.com",1,'Walking' has never looked so boring...,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,5465,"['Neil', 'Nightingale', 'Barry', 'Cook', 'direct', 'BBC', 'Earth',

David Krentz (the dinosaur designer and animator) has done an amazing job and it shows with active, quickly moving and avian looking dinosaurs.Sadly, the beautiful work of David Krentz was sabotaged by the nonsensical dialogue. Bathroom based humour, in an attempt to appeal to those too young to handle the more intense predation scenes, is only one of the schizophrenic aspects of this train wreck of a film (remember we are talking about the audio only in this critical part of my review). The dialogue shifts between toddler type jokes, to teenage banter, then to semi serious moral issues, then quickly back to the tail end of the digestive system, in case the audience did not already have enough reference to defecation and the rectum. Even the storyline is derailed by the dialogue.I really hope that the producers of this film read the reviews from most every columnist, which echo my own commentary. For the DVD release PLEASE offer an alternate audio track, which will harken back to the original Walking With Dinosaurs, the beloved and groundbreaking series. Narration that does not attempt to run away, competing with the visuals, but offers insightful and thoughtful information, just as the brilliant work of Kenneth Branaugh in the original series, would rescue and redeem this film.If it was possible to have and experience which does not insult the viewer, but instead offers to enlighten, educate and delight, would surely win over those put off by the grave errors this film committed in its audio choices.",3,"Wonderful visual treat, abysmal audio annoyance.",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,1606,"['will', 'begin', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'visual', 'aspect', 'stunning', 'David', 'Krentz', 'dinosaur', 'designer', 'animator', 'done', 'amazing', 'job', 'active', 'quickly', 'moving', 'avian', 'looking', 'dinosaurs.Sadly', 'beautiful', 'work', 'David', 'Krentz', 'was', 'sabotaged', 'nonsensical', 'dialogue', 'Bathroom', 'based', 'humour', 'attempt', 'appeal', 'too', 'young', 'handle', 'more', 'intense', 'predation', 'scenes', 'only', 'one', 'schizophrenic', 'aspects', 'train', 'wreck', 'film', 'remember', 'are', 'talking', 'audio', 'only', 'critical', 'part', 'review', 'dialogue', 'shifts', 'toddler', 'type', 'jokes', 'teenage', 'banter', 'then', 'semi', 'serious', 'moral', 'issues', 'then', 'quickly', 'back', 'tail', 'end', 'digestive', 'system', 'case', 'audience', 'did', 'not', 'already', 'have', 'enough', 'reference', 'defecation', 'rectum', 'Even', 'storyline', 'derailed', 'dialogue.I', 'really', 'hope', 'producers', 'film', 'read', 'reviews', 'most', 'columnist', 'echo', 'own', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'release', 'PLEASE', 'offer', 'alternate', 'audio', 'track', 'will', 'harken', 'back', 'original', 'Walking', 'Dinosaurs', 'beloved', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'Narration', 'not', 'attempt', 'run', 'away', 'competing', 'visuals', 'insightful', 'thoughtful', 'information', 'just', 'brilliant', 'work', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'original', 'series', 'would', 'rescue', 'redeem', 'film.If', 'was', 'possible', 'have', 'experience', 'not', 'insult', 'viewer', 'instead', 'offers', 'enlighten', 'educate', 'delight', 'would', 'surely', 'win', 'over', 'put', 'off', 'grave', 'errors', 'film', 'committed', 'audio', 'choices']",Walking With Dinosaurs

1684356,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00H7KJTMG,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[2, 2]","A FILM ONLY FOR CHILDREN, borrowing heavily from Disney's &#34;Dinosaur&#34;, &#34;Land before time&#34; and &#34;March of the dinosaurs&#34;,Even if the title is the same this children oriented film has virtually NOTHING IN COMMON with the ground-breaking 1999 BBC series &#34;Walking with dinosaurs&#34;, as far from being a document, this is in fact a film for kids, in which dinosaurs and birds are intelligent and can talk. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.PARENTAL WARNING! Some scenes in this film can and will TERRIFY youngest children, especially in 3D (both in theaters and at home) - the scariest scenes include very large predators (there are numerous Gorgosaurus in this film) jumping towards the public and seemingly trying to gnaw at the spectators with their mouths (filled with scary looking teeth) wide open and violently snapping. I would rather avoid showing it to children below at least age of 7. There is also a pretty scary and impressive scene of HUGE RAGING FOREST FIRE and some terrified and crying for help pachyrhinosaurus DROWNING in a freezing lake...First, let's stress it again, in this film, like in Disney's 2000 film &#34;Dinosaur&#34; and like in &#34;Land before time&#34; series some dinosaurs (and one bird) are fully intelligent and can talk. Like in Disney's film, we begin with the main hero, a young pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi, being just a hatchling - and the runt of the litter... Patchi, his big bully of brother named Scowler and his other siblings speak, A LOT - on another hand for some reason their parents don't talk. At all.Patchi is very badly treated by his brothers and sisters, but he befriends a prehistoric bird named Alex, who plays with him and talks. A LOT! Later Patchi will meet Juniper, a little female pachyrhinosaurus of same age as him, who will become the love of his life. As you can see, the main dinosaurs here are fully &#34;humanized&#34; as in &#34;Dinosaur&#34; and &#34;Land before time&#34; and they will continue this way during all the film, even when they are fully grown up. On another hand other dinosaurs and other creatures (including some pesky cretaceous mammals) don't speak.This film borrows A LOT from Disney's &#34;Dinosaur&#34;, with Patchi being in many ways similar to Aladar, Juniper being a carbon copy of Neera and especially the character of Scowler being an almost identical twin to Kron. To continue the similarities, bird Alex simply replaces the lemurs and the pack of gorgosaurus takes the place of the pair of carnotaurus. The species are different, but the characters are not... Sorry, SPOILER here: even the final fight was copied from the final confrontation in &#34;Dinosaur&#34;...On another hand, this film is also in large part inspired by a good document called &#34;March of dinosaurs&#34; (see my review of this one) made in 2011 and narrated by Stephen Fry. Both this film and &#34;The March of the dinosaurs&#34; are centered around the yearly migration of a huge herd of dinosaurs living in Cretaceous in North America to the south in autumn and then back to the north in spring. In &#34;The March of the dinosaurs&#34; the main character was a young edmontosaurus called Scar because it was hurt in childhood and the pachyrhinosaurus are secondary characters - here the main hero is a pachyrhinosaurus called Patchi, who was hurt and scarred in childhood and the edmontosaurus are secondary characters... In both films we also meet some gorgosaurus, troodons and scavenging pterosaurs. I personally found &#34;The March of dinosaurs&#34;, which is a document trying to stick very closely to science, much much better and at least as interesting for older children and teenagers.My 12 years old daughter - who likes dinosaurs, monsters, aliens, mutants and anything else that goes nicely with popcorn - enjoyed this film, which contains some pretty humouristic moments, provided mostly by wise-cracking bird Alex. Me on another hand, I was only partially satisfied, for following reasons:- the images are certainly gorgeous but ultimately not really better than in the &#34;Walking with dinosaurs&#34; which was after all made 14 years ago- the 3D is useful in a couple of sequences (I was really tempted to try to pat a quetzalcoatlus pterosaur on its beak...) but not really so much needed during the rest of the film.- the number of dinosaurs species shown is really rather limited for such a long film - only four species are really shown for any duration (pachyrhinosaurus, gorgosaurus, troodon, edmontosaurus) together with the quetzalcoatlus pterosaurs one bird and a couple of little mammals. There is also one ankylosaurus and a couple of chirostenotes, parksosaurus and hesperonychus all appearing like for 10 seconds... and that is all.- the film doesn't know really where to go. Most of time it is a film purely for children, but then by moments it tries to be also a document - and as a result it is not entirely succesful in either category.Bottom line, this is a watchable dinosaur film FOR OLDER CHILDREN and YOUNG TEENAGERS, but nothing else. For adults and older teenagers I really advise to skip it and watch/re-watch other great British dinosaur productions like the original &#34;Walking with dinosaurs&#34; series and &#34;The March of dinosaurs&#34; or the excellent American series &#34;Dinosaur revolution&#34;.",2,"A FILM ONLY FOR CHILDREN, borrowing heavily from Disney's ""Dinosaur"", ""Land before time"" and ""March of the

Making the dinosaurs talk was a very unfortunate, last minute, post-production decision that ruined the movie. As you may have noticed there was no talking in the first teaser trailer. So here's what went wrong:--The dialog was full of nonstop dopey `humor' and poop jokes to the point where you can't even enjoy the film. I found myself being lost in the amazing FX for a brief moment... before being slapped in the face with a stupid wise-crack or poop joke. URG! Some have argued that: ""Well it's supposed to be fun for kids!"" NO. NO. A THOUSAND TIMES NO. The dialog is extremely patronizing to child audience's intelligence. They do not need to be spoon fed nonstop silly humor to be entertained.--The talking NEVER STOPS. Like I said, the talking was added later in post -production and OOOooooh does it show. It doesn't match up with the film and all and feels very forced (like someone reading quickly from a script while the movie is playing in front of them). Even dark and serious moments in the film are ruined by goofy jokes. If you MUST see it... bring noise canceling headphones so you can just enjoy the visuals.--Only the 4 main characters spoke... which was just awkward... why are the rest silent? Once again making the talking feel like it doesn't belong.--The film pauses every time a new dinosaur appears for a child to tell you it's name and its eating habits. This `feature' really interrupts the movie and you don't learn anything (any dinosaur loving kid would already know the information given).REMOVE THE TALKING.The visuals are great, but that doesn't save it.

The beautifully shot landscapes and dinosaurs are worth seeing, but they hardly make up for the lack of interesting story the film really needs.&#8220;Walking with Dinosaurs&#8221; follows the adventures of a young Pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi and his competitive elder brother Scowler. Patchi is also smitten with another dinosaur Juniper. There is also an Alexornis bird Alex, as a narrator and comic relief.Those principal characters can &#8220;talk&#8221; as the studio provided voiceovers played by human actors. In fact, the film begins with a brief, live-action &#8220;frame story&#8221; where Uncle Zack (Karl Urban) takes out two kids in a car.I know the film is primarily made for children, and filmmakers are only trying to make it easier for younger audiences to connect to the characters, but this time they went too far. There is also toilet humor that seems out of place here.I am not sure why this film had to be made in the first place when there is an original TV series.
