298642,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302158176,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Godfather Part III, 1990 filmThe film begins in the fall (brown leaves for symbolism). There are flashbacks to the earlier 1970s movies to remind you of the past (and pad out the time). In 1979 Michael Corleone receives an award for his charitable works. [Not unlike other millionaires?] There is a celebration later where we meet other people. There is a problem with nephew Vincent (Sonny's boy). Will he have bad luck? No. Michael Corleone wants the Vatican to vote their shares in a corporation so Michael will get control of the Immobiliare Corporation (real estate holdings). [Do real estate holdings have special tax treatment as capital gains?] Will the Vatican Bank put their money in? ""Why am I doing this?"" Do others want to invest? But there is a glitch in taking control. Is the old neighborhood having a problem? `Never hate your enemy - it affects your judgment.""At the meeting Joey Zazza speaks out and asks for a vote. The others want to invest in Immobiliare. But there is a shocking surprise to finish the party! Later Michael has a diabetic stroke. There is trouble again. During a parade shots are fire to kill Zazza and his men. What will Michael do? The scene shifts to Italy. Strategy is plotted. Did the violence there result from history? Michael complains about a financial swindle. Stress causes low blood sugar. The death of Pope Paul VI is announced. Are the rich more corrupt? [The movie slows down here.] There are plots and counter-plots; we know what will happen. [The movie slows down here.] A new pope is elected, Lamberto will be called John Paul I. There will be reforms in the Vatican Bank. Nephew Vincent will take charge (as in a feudal society).The opera `Cavalleria Rusticana' (symbolism?) has many guests. Is it dangerous to be an honest man? Things seem to be building to a climax. ""Love somebody else."" [Does this scene at the opera remind you of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much""?] Who killed Pope John Paul I? Who killed the others? What difference did it make? The bodies fall as in some operas. Was that the intent of this story? A latter-day tragedy?Was this movie deliberately crippled to put an end to this saga? Parts I & II were made fifteen years earlier, and were more dramatic. This version avoided referencing political corruption in America. The hidden scandal about the Vatican Bank was its use for money laundering and avoiding taxes on investments: no official reports. The assassin in the opera house used a rifle that resembled the Mannlicher-Carcano bought by Oswald. A professional killer would use a rifle so he can escape to enjoy his pay. A fanatic would use a pistol because he does not fear the capture that makes him famous.",2,The End of the Saga,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,2695,"['Godfather', 'Part', 'III', '1990', 'filmThe', 'film', 'fall', 'brown', 'leaves', 'symbolism', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'earlier', '1970s', 'movies', 'remind', 'past', 'out', 'time', '1979', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'award', 'charitable', 'works', '[', 'Not', 'other', 'millionaires', ']', 'celebration', 'later', 'where', 'meet', 'other', 'people', 'problem', 'nephew', 'Vincent', 'Sonny', 'boy', 'Will', 'have', 'bad', 'luck', 'No', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'Vatican', 'vote', 'shares', 'corporation', 'Michael', 'will', 'get', 'control', 'Immobiliare', 'Corporation', 'real', 'estate', 'holdings', 'Do', 'real', 'estate', 'holdings', 'have', 'special', 'tax', 'treatment', 'capital', 'gains', ']', 'Will', 'Vatican', 'Bank', 'put', 'money', 'Why', 'am', 'doing', 'Do', 'others', 'want', 'invest', 'glitch', 'taking', 'control', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'having', 'problem', 'Never', 'hate', 'enemy', 'judgment', 'meeting', 'Joey', 'Zazza', 'out', 'asks', 'vote', 'others', 'want', 'invest', 'Immobiliare', 'shocking', 'surprise', 'finish', 'party', 'Later', 'Michael', 'diabetic', 'stroke', 'trouble', 'again', 'parade', 'shots', 'are', 'fire', 'kill', 'Zazza', 'men', 'What', 'will', 'Michael', 'do', 'scene', 'shifts', 'Italy', 'Strategy', 'plotted', 'Did', 'violence', 'there', 'history', 'Michael', 'financial', 'swindle', 'Stress', 'low', 'blood', 'sugar', 'death', 'Pope', 'Paul', 'VI', 'announced', 'Are', 'rich', 'more', 'corrupt', '[', 'movie', 'down', 'here', ']', 'are', 'plots', 'counter-plots', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', '[', 'movie', 'down', 'here', ']', 'new', 'pope', 'elected', 'Lamberto', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'John', 'Paul', 'will', 'be', 'reforms', 'Vatican', 'Bank', 'Nephew', 'Vincent', 'will', 'take', 'charge', 'feudal', 'society', 'opera', 'Cavalleria', 'Rusticana', 'symbolism', 'many', 'guests', 'dangerous', 'be', 'honest', 'man', 'Things', 'seem', 'be', 'building', 'climax', 'Love', 'somebody', 'else', '[', 'scene', 'opera', 'remind', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', ']', 'Who', 'killed', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'Who', 'killed', 'others', 'What', 'difference', 'did', 'make', 'bodies', 'fall', 'operas', 'Was', 'intent', 'story', 'latter-day', 'tragedy', 'Was', 'movie', 'deliberately', 'crippled', 'put', 'end', 'saga', 'Parts', 'II', 'were', 'made', 'fifteen', 'years', 'earlier', 'were', 'more', 'dramatic', 'version', 'avoided', 'referencing', 'political', 'corruption', 'America', 'hidden', 'scandal', 'Vatican', 'Bank', 'was', 'use', 'money', 'laundering', 'avoiding', 'taxes', 'investments', 'official', 'reports', 'assassin', 'opera', 'house', 'used', 'rifle', 'resembled', 'Mannlicher-Carcano', 'bought', 'Oswald', 'A', 'professional', 'killer', 'would', 'use', 'rifle', 'can', 'escape', 'enjoy', 'pay', 'fanatic', 'would', 'use', 'pistol', 'not', 'fear', 'capture', 'famous']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"
298643,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302158176,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 6]","It baffles me sometimes to think about the amount of seething hatred heaped on the third installment of such a beloved trilogy (the first two films are regarded by many as clear masterpieces, and yet so many consider this third film a parody or sorts).  That isn't to say that it isn't flawed, for it certainly is, and the nostalgic angle that the original two films takes is lost in this particular film, but overall this is certainly a well-made and engaging film that shouldn't be so ferociously compared to its superior predecessors.  I understand that inclination, for it is only natural, to expect something grander from such noble beginnings, but `The Godfather part III' is a film that stands on its own and so when taken out of the initial context and judged solely on its own merits, the flaws fade from great to few.Yes, there are some flaws that just won't fade away, but as its own film `The Godfather part III' is certainly better than most.With a different focal point (less on the family, more on the Church), this installment doesn't quite fit in with the internal flow of the first two films; and considering the glossy update it received (being made nearly two decades after the original) it almost feels like it was cut from a different mold.  That may be a reason why so many impulsively label it as a weak or laughable inclusion in such a genius series, but there is so much to really love here.For starters, Al Pacino is spot on perfection here.  The way he's molded one solidary character throughout three films (and multiple generations) is flawless.  This is his grand opus (the character, not this particular film) and it shows in the way he closes out this man.  In watching the films back to back you can see the wholeness of the character spring to life gradually yet with steely power and technique.  It reminds me a bit of how I felt while watching the recent phenomenon known as `The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'.  What Noomi Rapace does over the course of three films is brilliant, slowly fleshing out an entire character.  The difference is that one really needs to see all three films in the Millennium trilogy to appreciate Rapace's performance.  That isn't the case with Pacino and The Godfather films.  Each performance is a performance all its own that works in perfect unison with the previous yet is not reliant on the performance that came before it to grab out attention and respect.While much has been made about Sophia Coppola's lack of acting talent (she is a brilliant director though), it's almost like too much attention has been given to one glaring flaw and not enough given to the fact that the film sports fine performances by everyone else, including the Oscar nominated Andy Garcia.From a technical standpoint, the film is a marvel.  In its glossy veneer, the film still carries a thick film of grit that captures the heart of the franchise.  Coppola's direction is enticing; the production values are insanely well done and the overall impact of the visuals here are spellbinding.It's a pretty picture; no doubt.And so, in closing I'll say this; while the film itself does not live up to the name backing it (and I wholly admit that), there is nothing wrong with embracing this film for what it is.  It is a very entertaining and rewarding crime drama laced with characters we have grown to love (or at least love to watch) and littered with performances that make watching this a pleasure (and yes, one performance that makes watching this a trial at times).The film is good; end of discussion.",4,So much hate...,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,3552,"['sometimes', 'think', 'amount', 'seething', 'hatred', 'heaped', 'third', 'installment', 'such', 'beloved', 'trilogy', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'regarded', 'many', 'clear', 'masterpieces', 'yet', 'so', 'many', 'consider', 'third', 'film', 'parody', 'sorts', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'flawed', 'certainly', 'nostalgic', 'angle', 'original', 'two', 'films', 'lost', 'particular', 'film', 'overall', 'certainly', 'well-made', 'engaging', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'ferociously', 'compared', 'superior', 'predecessors', 'understand', 'inclination', 'only', 'natural', 'expect', 'something', 'grander', 'such', 'noble', 'beginnings', 'Godfather', 'part', 'III', 'film', 'own', 'so', 'when', 'taken', 'initial', 'context', 'judged', 'solely', 'own', 'merits', 'flaws', 'fade', 'great', 'few.Yes', 'are', 'flaws', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fade', 'away', 'own', 'film', 'Godfather', 'part', 'III', 'certainly', 'better', 'most.With', 'different', 'focal', 'point', 'less', 'family', 'more', 'Church', 'installment', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'internal', 'flow', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'considering', 'glossy', 'update', 'received', 'being', 'made', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'original', 'almost', 'was', 'cut', 'different', 'mold', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'impulsively', 'label', 'weak', 'laughable', 'inclusion', 'such', 'genius', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'love', 'here.For', 'starters', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'spot', 'perfection', 'here', 'way', 'molded', 'one', 'solidary', 'character', 'three', 'films', 'multiple', 'generations', 'flawless', 'grand', 'opus', 'character', 'not', 'particular', 'film', 'way', 'out', 'man', 'watching', 'films', 'back', 'back', 'can', 'see', 'wholeness', 'character', 'spring', 'life', 'gradually', 'yet', 'steely', 'power', 'technique', 'bit', 'how', 'felt', 'watching', 'recent', 'phenomenon', 'known', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'What', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'course', 'three', 'films', 'brilliant', 'slowly', 'fleshing', 'out', 'entire', 'character', 'difference', 'one', 'really', 'see', 'three', 'films', 'Millennium', 'trilogy', 'appreciate', 'Rapace', 'performance', ""n't"", 'case', 'Pacino', 'Godfather', 'films', 'performance', 'performance', 'own', 'perfect', 'unison', 'previous', 'yet', 'not', 'reliant', 'performance', 'came', 'grab', 'out', 'attention', 'respect.While', 'much', 'been', 'made', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'lack', 'acting', 'talent', 'brilliant', 'director', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'been', 'given', 'one', 'glaring', 'flaw', 'not', 'enough', 'given', 'fact', 'film', 'sports', 'fine', 'performances', 'everyone', 'else', 'including', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Andy', 'Garcia.From', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'marvel', 'glossy', 'veneer', 'film', 'still', 'thick', 'film', 'grit', 'heart', 'franchise', 'Coppola', 'direction', 'enticing', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'insanely', 'well', 'done', 'overall', 'impact', 'visuals', 'here', 'are', 'pretty', 'picture', 'doubt.And', 'so', 'closing', ""'ll"", 'say', 'film', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'name', 'backing', 'wholly', 'admit', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'embracing', 'film', 'what', 'very', 'entertaining', 'rewarding', 'crime', 'drama', 'laced', 'characters', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'least', 'love', 'watch', 'littered', 'performances', 'make', 'watching', 'pleasure', 'yes', 'one', 'performance', 'watching', 'trial', 'times', '.The', 'film', 'good', 'end', 'discussion']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"
298644,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302158176,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 2]","THE GODFATHER: Part III opens with 62-year-old Michael Corleone seeking redemption and a way to expunge the many crimes and personal failings of his past, but as we learn, he will never be ""legit,"" can't buy a spotless soul nor will his own nagging conscience ever allow this tortured man some peace. He makes, and with the help of step-nephew Vincent Mancini, breaks a vow to ""never sin again,"" and it's suggested that Michael's day of reckoning when he doesn't keep his word to God is the result. (semi-spoiler ahead)No, it's not equal to parts I and !!, yet despite this third Godfather film's few shortcomings, it can't be denied that its climactic scene is truly gut-wrenching, because unlike other murders throughout the 9-hour series, there is loud wailing on all sides as soon as this one occurs, crying and shouts of woe that really get to a viewer (it does to me, at least!). The ""crime pays only to a certain extent"" subtext is clear, and when some years later he passes away, all alone on a sunny Sicilian day, this is a mere footnote to Michael's true demise, which happened on the steps of a Palermo opera house that terrible night.Director Francis Coppola originally considered having Michael fatally wounded in this sequence, then he'd roll down the stairs. Ex-wife Kaye comes to his side and asks, ""Michael, are you dying?"" He'd answer, ""No,"" and then expire. Coppola preferred instead to have the ex-Don Corleone suffer for his sins, and suffer mightily he does. That forlorn, delayed scream he lets out when the tragedy is done can only scratch the surface of Michael's grief. You clearly see it in his eyes: although still breathing Michael Corleone has ceased to exist.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(7.6) The Godfather: Part III (1990) - Al Pacino/Diane Keaton/Talia Shire/Andy Garcia/Eli Wallach/Joe Mantegna/George Hamilton/Bridget Fonda/Sofia Coppola/Raf Vallone/Helmut Berger/Don Novello/John Savage/Al Martino/Catherine Scorsese (uncredited: Ron Jeremy/Carmine Coppola)",5,""" I killed...

298645,A1534MBU6VJXYN,6302158176,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[6, 9]","On its own, ""The Godfather Part III"" is actually a pretty good movie. However, in comparion to its two predecessors, I'm sorry but the film just doesn't hold its ground. Coppola and Puzzo were running out of ideas, and the cast members, both returning and new, basically phoned in their performances.The main problems with the film are script and casting. First of all, the plot is filled with more holes than Sonny Corleone's body when he got shot at the toll booth. Several new characters are introduced to the story, many of them with little to no origins that just pop out of nowhere. There is some weird plot against the Vatican that may have looked good on paper but just didn't transfer well onto the screen. Then, there's the cast. Pacino and Andy Garcia were great, but for the most part, the cast sleepwalked through their performances, including Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna were welcome additions to the cast but they too couldn't muster up decent performances. Whose idea was it to replace Robert Duvall with George Hamilton? What was Bridget Fonda doing there again? And then there's Sofia Coppola - look, Francis, we all know you love your daughter, but if you really loved her, you wouldn't go exploiting her lack of acting talent like you did with this film.The film is not a complete waste, however. The scenes from Sicily, for exmple, are brilliantly written and breathtakingly filmed. As an Italian, I can honestly say this is the best footage of the Sicillian landscape ever to be put on film. The usual death montage at the end of the film was cool to watch, and the Atlantic City Massacre sequence was incredibly well done.Overall, get this film only if you want to own the complete trilogy on dvd.

The opera scene is the killer for dragging the pace. I've seen reports of bashing on Sofia Coppola, but I think she did just fine. Al Pacino once again dominates the movie as he does for the whole trilogy. For that, he should be received a special honorary award based on his performances of three movies. Andy Garcia, for his brashness, aces it with the mixed temperament of Michael and Sonny. Introducing Don Altobello to this film, Francis Ford Coppola makes mistake because there is no set up of his character in the previous two films. The strong scenes in this film are: the creation of a new Don through Vincent, Vincent/Zasa in Michael's study, the ambush in the Atlantic City ballroom, and Mary's murder at the end of the film. Again, the picture looks great as usual. Although not strong as the original, The Godfather Part III retained the same style with some recycling of the same concepts.12/07: Here we go again: another three hour snooze-fest. The Godfather Part III, thankfully, is the final chapter of this mediocre trilogy. Everything I saw of The Godfather Part III is average at best, but there are worse parts about it. I've read reviews, and nearly all of them bashes Sofia Coppola into smithereens, contributing to its failure. Guess what? She isn't the problem...far from it. The Godfather Part III sums up everything I've thought about each of the first two pictures, and my reaction is no different this time around. The Godfather trilogy has been overrated right from the start due to several factors. One, there is no depth. Two, there is not enough of character development for anybody. Three, there isn't an iota of care from me about the family or anybody else for that matter. The overall acting of the whole trilogy, while boasting an impressive cast, has been exaggerated to great lengths that I am simply unfazed. I also read that the absence of Robert Duvall killed The Godfather Part III. Please...give me a break. His lack of presence doesn't matter. To start with a small number of positives out of The Godfather Part III, it has a few good moments. The cinematography is wonderful as usual, and Andy Garcia gives a nice, perhaps energetic, performance but not worthy of mention. Now, with the negatives, that wasn't Michael Corleone I saw. That is Al Pacino being Al Pacino. What's with his haircut? Given that his character is interested in maintaining his familial tradition, Michael Corleone would've never sported that radical look. The movie takes place in 1979, but the film felt like it was 1990. Once again, The Godfather Part III manages to be redundant as this third part opens almost exactly in the same way as the first two pictures did. In fact, much of The Godfather Part III is recycled from the previous two. That's why the movie felt like it was going in circles. I am surprised to see, after the first two have gotten rich cinematography work, how made-for-TV The Godfather Part III sometimes feels like. Some scenes are horribly shot. Possibly the worst aspect of The Godfather Part III is its screenplay. The dialogues are laughably bad, and unlike the last two films, the lines were incredibly hollow. It's no surprise that each of three pictures in the whole trilogy has been seen overrated because of the hollowness of the dialogues. That, in effect, harms the overall development of the characters individually and the family as whole while lacking any credible depth among characters within each other. Again and again, I am particularly surprised how characters appear and disappear without any reminiscence of them. Michael begins one for his very first wife, but nobody else very much. Speaking of the magnitude that Michael Corleone brings in terms of power, how come his family is so small? When I say family, I mean his relatives and his mafia hoods; at the same time, only one or two bodyguards for Michael Corleone? Especially when there is a price for his head? Going back to Sofia Coppola, I don't see, after viewing this picture few times, anything wrong with her performance at all. I am surprised to see that George Hamilton was in the picture, and his face gives the impression that he is oddly out of place. Finally in The Godfather Part III, Francis Ford Coppola starts to develop some depth between Michael and his former wife. But too late. Talia Shire: what a surprise that her character in The Godfather Part III gets more latitude than ever. Is it necessary? I think not, especially how little attention the women received in the first two pictures. Another terrible aspect about The Godfather trilogy is how characters appear in the second and third part without knowing who the hell they are. A great example in The Godfather Part III is Don Altobello. Who the hell is he? Probably the softest and weakest part of the trilogy is how the family had managed to come away unscathed by the police and FBI. One silly scene occurred in Vincent Mancini's bedroom of the apartment where the bad guy with a panty-hosed face entered the room, shooting the bed, yet I saw neither a bullet through the bed nor a movement of the bed. Anyway, The Godfather Part III isn't that awful as the reputation says, but it sums up excellently of all problems that I saw in the whole trilogy.12/12: I had a feeling that The Godfather Part III isn't a bad film as critics make it out to be. They went overboard with the criticism of Sofia Coppola (Jesus...the role almost went to Julia Roberts) and tried to pinpoint the excuse of the film's downfall on her. Really, for me, why I think The Godfather Part III couldn't sustain the strength anymore is because the whole thing is silly. The mafia is stupid and childish. When Michael Corleone is throwing big words around, he looks like a caricature. He says that he did it all for the family. Yeah, but what do you mean, Michael? You made the family rich by stealing money from people and then killing them? By the time the daughter dies and he has an overdone catharsis moment, I feel nothing but a relief that the trilogy is finally over. The length was getting to me midway of The Godfather Part III. Andy Garcia is very good in his performance, and there is a powerful moment when the abdication of the Don is passed onto him. Anyway, the cinematography remains a very strong, powerful factor in seeing the The Godfather Part III.

I find her cute and charmingly fresh, though, and her presence kept my eye from wandering off screen. Her acting is certainly no worse than that of bland Bridget Fonda and dull Andy Garcia.The worst offender in the cast, however, is Al Pacino. Looking and sounding nothing like he did in ""Part II"" sixteen years earlier, he's short-tempered and even blustery in ways that one does not associate with cold, calculating Michael Corleone. The man who cruelly ordered the execution of his brother, Fredo, and withdrew to the point that he was a zombie, is suddenly impassioned without reason. It simply fails to be credible. Pacino might as well be playing a completely different character because this is not the Michael Corleone of the earlier films.Stylistically, ""Part III"" is rather plain, even drab, lacking the artistry that made ""Part II"" a masterpiece and the best in the series.

Al Pacino is brilliant in his seminal role as Michael, but his acting skills can't compensate for a convoluted and wandering plot, or the fatal flaw that nearly ruins this movie: the casting of Sofia Coppola in the role of Michael's daughter.Others might pass off Coppoloa's poor acting skills as &quot;so what?&quot; but it's incomprehensible that Coppola allowed his amateur daughter play such a vital role. Every time Sofia Coppola is in a scene, the viewer cringes because her acting abilities are, quite frankly, non-existent. Her limitations as an actress are absolute in every department, and her scenes with Pacino are particularly difficult to watch. Pacino is one of the greatest actors of the post-1950 generation, but here he is saddled with a woman who is not in the same league, by an impossibly wide margin. I noticed other reviewers slamming her for her lack of physical attractions: this is also jarring and ruins an otherwise adequate movie.Andy Garcia is quite good in the role of Michael's nephew, Vincent, though he can't hold a candle to James Caan's performance as Sonny in the original Godfather. The Vincent subplot is ultimately plodding and distracting.There is one great scene in the movie: when Michael and Kay return to Sicily and he asks her forgiveness and they admit they still love one another. This is as touching and as beautifully written as scene as anything in the previous two Godfather movies.Ultimately, Godfather III fails because it faces an impossible task. No movie can duplicate the sheer brilliance of its predecessors and the casting of Sofia Coppola undermines it completely.

298657,ANJSV7TKWLPJV,6302158176,Chance,"[4, 8]","An ill-advised plan to go for the easy money sixteen years after the glory days of Godfather I and II, Coppola and company don't even come close to the spirit and quality of those first two films.The reason that  Godfather II bucks the sequel trend, and is nearly every bit as good as the  original, is twofold- first, each film introduces a new actor or two to the  immense cast.  The new actor introduced to the mix in Godfather II is  Robert DeNiro as a young Don Corleone, who is a wonderful addition to the  series (For his counterpart in III, see below).  The second reason is that  Puzo's book proved to have too much material for any film (even a lengthy  one) to accomodate.  So with the original still in theatres, Coppola  created a second film from the source material left behind two years  earlier.  Attempting to go &quot;back to the well&quot; after nearly two  decades was a bad idea.Much of the rest of the blame for this terrible  film must fall on the new cast member introduced in this film, Sophia  Coppola.  Heck, if Francis wanted to employ more of his family (not that we  should mind- his father's score is consistently fantastic), he should have  considered Nicholas Cage.  Sophia, replacing a much better actor who  droppped out at the last moment, is completely out of her element (and who  wouldn't be, in her first film?  Still, she took the part, she can take the  lumps).  For as much of the film revolves around her character, this is  inexcusable.  Andy Garcia is a better addition to the ensemble, if a bit  over the top.The rest of the film is a tired re-hash.  We are even  treated to a new non-Italian consigliere, and George Hamilton is no Robert  Duvall.

298662,ATYKXNLVOZN02,6302158176,Constant Viewer,"[3, 4]","After giving us with GF1 and GF2 2 of the greatest films American cinema has yet produced, Francis Ford Coppola unfortunately gave in to the temptation to create a trilogy.  He should have quit while he was ahead. Cinematographically, GF3 is stunning, the acting almost uniformly superb.  But while watching it for the first time in theatrical release I was astounded at its endless succession of ripped-off images.  This convinced me that Coppola had run out of ideas.  Another of these reviews rightly points out that Coppola skilfully blended fact and fiction by adapting the Vatican Bank scandal for GF3 but even this is, in the last analysis, an act of borrowing of the kind that typifies the film.Additional Example 1:  the street scene in which Joey Zaza is killed. The assasin is disguised as a mounted police officer & as he fires says, ""Take that, Zaza.""  Remember Zsa Zsa Gabor's trial for slapping a police officer?Additional Example 2: The much lauded shot of Pacino, as Michael Corleone, on the opera house steps as he realizes his daughter is dead.  It seems horrific--until you realize it's merely one of the 20th century's most iconic image: Edvard Munch's ""The Scream.""Additional Example 3: Pacino dying and falling off his chair in the film's final shot.  Pure Rowan and Martin's ""Laugh-in"" with Artie Johnson's dirty old man putting the moves on Ruth Buzzi's frump & falling off the park bench after she hits him with her purse.  Unfortunately, Buzzi doesn't appear in GF3.Additional Example 4: the ascending spiral of murders counterpointed against a performance of ""Cavalleria Rusticana.""  Here Coppola rips off his own GF1, specifically the baptism sequence in which Corleone rivals are violently killed while Michael stands godfather to his sister's son.  In both cases, the sordidly violent is juxtaposed with the sublime.  Effective, but inevitably less so in its repetitiveness in GF3 than it was in GF1, where it was new and had tremendous impact (arguably among the most striking sequences in film history---right up there with that baby buggy in ""Battleship Potemkin"").Unfortunately Coppola further weakens the final moments by having Talia Shire repeat a gesture taken from the opera stage just minutes before--she raises her scarf over her head in a traditional Sicilian sign of mourning.  A tad trite, though it is a reminder that for all Michael's yearning for respectability, the Corleones always remained a Sicilian village clan.As to the casting, Coppola erred grievously by not offering Robert Duvall a salary equal to Pacino's, who according to Duvall was to get 3 times what Duvall was offered.  It hurts to imagine what Duvall could have done for this film.  It is equally painful to recall Sofia Coppola's presence in the film, which cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be called a performance.  So Coppola couldn't land the actress he wanted for the part; there were lots of other highly competent young ladies out there. Yet he insisted on using his woefully inexperienced daughter.  Go figure.  Ms Coppola has landed on her feet as a director, but here's hoping she has the sense never again to step in front of a camera.",3,He should've quit while he was ahead,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,3173,"['giving', 'GF1', 'GF2', '2', 'greatest', 'films', 'American', 'cinema', 'yet', 'produced', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'unfortunately', 'gave', 'temptation', 'create', 'trilogy', 'should', 'have', 'quit', 'was', 'ahead', 'Cinematographically', 'GF3', 'stunning', 'acting', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'astounded', 'endless', 'succession', 'ripped-off', 'images', 'convinced', 'Coppola', 'had', 'run', 'ideas', 'reviews', 'rightly', 'out', 'Coppola', 'skilfully', 'blended', 'fact', 'fiction', 'adapting', 'Vatican', 'Bank', 'scandal', 'GF3', 'even', 'last', 'analysis', 'act', 'borrowing', 'kind', 'film.Additional', 'Example', '1', 'street', 'scene', 'Joey', 'Zaza', 'killed', 'assasin', 'disguised', 'mounted', 'police', 'officer', 'Take', 'Zaza', 'Remember', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'trial', 'slapping', 'police', 'officer', 'Additional', 'Example', '2', 'much', 'lauded', 'shot', 'Pacino', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'opera', 'house', 'steps', 'daughter', 'dead', 'horrific', 'realize', 'merely', 'one', '20th', 'century', 'most', 'iconic', 'image', 'Edvard', 'Munch', 'Scream', 'Additional', 'Example', '3', 'Pacino', 'dying', 'falling', 'off', 'chair', 'film', 'final', 'shot', 'Pure', 'Rowan', 'Martin', 'Laugh-in', 'Artie', 'Johnson', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'putting', 'moves', 'Ruth', 'Buzzi', 'frump', 'falling', 'off', 'park', 'bench', 'purse', 'Unfortunately', 'Buzzi', ""n't"", 'appear', 'GF3.Additional', 'Example', '4', 'ascending', 'spiral', 'murders', 'counterpointed', 'performance', 'Cavalleria', 'Rusticana', 'Here', 'Coppola', 'own', 'GF1', 'specifically', 'baptism', 'sequence', 'Corleone', 'rivals', 'are', 'violently', 'killed', 'Michael', 'godfather', 'sister', 'son', 'cases', 'sordidly', 'violent', 'juxtaposed', 'sublime', 'Effective', 'inevitably', 'less', 'so', 'repetitiveness', 'GF3', 'was', 'GF1', 'where', 'was', 'new', 'had', 'tremendous', 'impact', 'arguably', 'most', 'striking', 'sequences', 'film', 'history', '-right', 'up', 'there', 'baby', 'buggy', 'Battleship', 'Potemkin', '.Unfortunately', 'Coppola', 'further', 'final', 'moments', 'having', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'repeat', 'gesture', 'taken', 'opera', 'stage', 'just', 'minutes', 'before', 'scarf', 'head', 'traditional', 'Sicilian', 'sign', 'mourning', 'tad', 'trite', 'reminder', 'Michael', 'yearning', 'respectability', 'Corleones', 'always', 'remained', 'Sicilian', 'village', 'clan.As', 'casting', 'Coppola', 'erred', 'grievously', 'not', 'offering', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'salary', 'equal', 'Pacino', 'who', 'according', 'Duvall', 'was', 'get', '3', 'times', 'what', 'Duvall', 'was', 'offered', 'imagine', 'what', 'Duvall', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'equally', 'painful', 'recall', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'presence', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'be', 'called', 'performance', 'So', 'Coppola', 'could', ""n't"", 'land', 'actress', 'wanted', 'part', 'were', 'lots', 'other', 'highly', 'competent', 'young', 'ladies', 'there', 'insisted', 'using', 'woefully', 'inexperienced', 'daughter', 'Go', 'figure', 'Ms', 'Coppola', 'landed', 'feet', 'director', 'here', 'hoping', 'sense', 'never', 'again', 'step', 'front', 'camera']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

This is the question that many people asked themselves before and after seeing Francis Ford Coppola's third (and hopefully last) installment of The Godfather saga. The first two parts were such perfect meditations on violence and the absolute corrupting effect of money and power on an individual. The way Part II ended was a darkly poetic conclusion that nothing else really needed to be said.Apparently, Coppola thought otherwise and went back to the well one more time with Part III. The problem is that he waited too long. Too many years had passed and he had changed as a filmmaker. Almost going mad making Apocalypse Now and the commercial and critical failure of The Cotton Club had taken its toll on the man. Hollywood had changed and this is reflected in the movie. First and foremost is the casting: Andy Garcia? Bridget Fonda? George Hamilton?! They are fine actors in their own right but are they really acceptable substitutes for the likes of James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall? Granted the first two played characters that died in Parts I and II but the miscasting of these actors speaks volumes of what is wrong with so many movies coming out of Hollywood these days. Actors are cast for their marquee value and not because they are necessarily right for the role.The Godfather Part III has the feeling of a paycheck movie because it lacks the passion of the first two parts.

Other than the obvious fact that Sophia Coppola makes a MUCH better director than actress (her role would have been better suited for Italian actresses like Monica Bolluci or Asia Argento, but alas) the film still stands as a great movie.  No, it doesn't carry the same weight as the previous two, but that's mostly because this film focuses less on the Corleone family and more on the Church.  Al Pucino is SPOT on in this film, and whats great here is that with all three films we see a gradual progression of his charactor, starting in the first film as a man lost in is own steps and then in the second film as a strong and dangerous man and now finally in the third film we see the man that is Michael Corleone, not the gangster, not the son but the man he always meant to be.  This film follows as Michael reluctantly takes on his nephew (Sonny's son) Vincent (Andy Garcia) as an aprentice sort-of-speak, training him in the ways of the family business.  As a deal with the Church goes bad Michael is drug back into the world he thought he was leaving behind.  Michael wants to be legit now, he wants to be a good man, and throughout this film he's trying to prove that to Kay (Diane Keaton) as he tries to be there for his family.  Vincent has brought his own baggage to the table, and as he starts an affair with Michael's daughter (Sophia Coppola) there is turmoil as both Michael and Kay try and seperate them.  The film is much different then the first two but that doesn't make it a bad movie.  No, it's not as good, but as the Oscar Nominations will atest to, the film itself is still above average.",4,"""Every family has bad memories...""",1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,1743,"['thought', 'was', 'apt', 'quote', 'film', 'many', 'reviewers', 'film', 'Corleone', ""'bad"", 'memory', 'disagree', 'Other', 'obvious', 'fact', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'MUCH', 'better', 'director', 'actress', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'Italian', 'actresses', 'Monica', 'Bolluci', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'alas', 'film', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'No', ""n't"", 'carry', 'same', 'weight', 'previous', 'two', 'mostly', 'film', 'less', 'Corleone', 'family', 'more', 'Church', 'Al', 'Pucino', 'SPOT', 'film', 'great', 'here', 'three', 'films', 'see', 'gradual', 'progression', 'charactor', 'starting', 'first', 'film', 'man', 'lost', 'own', 'steps', 'then', 'second', 'film', 'strong', 'dangerous', 'man', 'now', 'finally', 'third', 'film', 'see', 'man', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'not', 'gangster', 'not', 'son', 'man', 'always', 'meant', 'be', 'film', 'Michael', 'reluctantly', 'nephew', 'Sonny', 'son', 'Vincent', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'aprentice', 'sort-of-speak', 'training', 'ways', 'family', 'business', 'deal', 'Church', 'bad', 'Michael', 'drug', 'back', 'world', 'thought', 'was', 'leaving', 'Michael', 'be', 'legit', 'now', 'be', 'good', 'man', 'film', 'trying', 'prove', 'Kay', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'be', 'there', 'family', 'Vincent', 'brought', 'own', 'baggage', 'table', 'affair', 'Michael', 'daughter', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'turmoil', 'Michael', 'Kay', 'try', 'seperate', 'film', 'much', 'different', 'then', 'first', 'two', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'movie', 'No', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Oscar', 'Nominations', 'will', 'atest', 'film', 'still', 'above', 'average']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"
298669,A29NRLC2CLHU6S,6302158176,Darth Vegas,"[2, 2]","This is the only Godfather film that I haven't seen over a hundred times, which is telling.  In many respects, it fits very well with the series.  Most of the acting and casting is spot-on, the acting strong, and the overall tone, continuing with the melancholic nature of 2.  And there is a strong continuity with the music, which has been such a major part of the trilogy.  I particularly like Andy Garcia -- if anything, he should have played a more major part.  He is believable as Sonny Corleone's illegimate son.  And it's nice to see many of the original players, acting as strong as ever -- some with a much more prominent role (esp. Shire).The movie unfortunately suffers from weaknesses that were not present in either 1 or 2.  I won't get into the miscasting of Sofia Coppola -- the critics have said enough.  I can just say that I cringe whenever she's on the screen.  Also, the story is often disjointed -- and while some have said the same about 2 (switching between the story of Michael and the young Vito), the story is occasionally hard to follow here, and continuity is not as smooth.I suppose my biggest problem with the movie is with Michael.  This has nothing really to do with Pacino, whose acting is flawless and intense.  It has more to do wtih the character of Michael.  He seems completely different from either 1 or 2.  Previously, he was cold, calculating, full of reason and lacking in emotion; here, he is completely the opposite -- compassionate, regretful, full of sadness, pitiful, even weak in spirit.  Even his tone of voice is different -- often calm but with a playful nature.I understand that Coppola wanted to manifest a change in the character, but what I think is missing is what happened between 2 and 3 to cause this growth/change/evolution.  Yes, at the end of part 2, Michael had committed the ultimate despicable act, and we can guess from the parting shots of his face that he was troubled, full of regret, wondering where he went wrong.  Here, he has made the transition almost completely from righteous Don to regretful old man.  I wish there had been more back story here.In any case, there are some very memorable scenes here, mostly involving Garcia and Pacino, and there was so much potential here to end the trilogy on a very strong, powerful note.  As it is, I too, like Michael, am left feeling a sadness -- that greatness was lost here somewhere.  Not that it is a bad movie -- but it should have been better.",4,"Almost a classic... as it is, a flawed but strong finale.",1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,2466,"['only', 'Godfather', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'telling', 'many', 'respects', 'very', 'well', 'series', 'Most', 'acting', 'casting', 'spot-on', 'acting', 'strong', 'overall', 'tone', 'continuing', 'melancholic', 'nature', '2', 'strong', 'continuity', 'music', 'been', 'major', 'part', 'trilogy', 'particularly', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'anything', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'more', 'major', 'part', 'believable', 'Sonny', 'Corleone', 'illegimate', 'son', 'nice', 'see', 'many', 'original', 'players', 'acting', 'as', 'strong', 'ever', 'much', 'more', 'prominent', 'role', 'esp', 'Shire', '.The', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'suffers', 'weaknesses', 'were', 'not', 'present', '1', '2', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'miscasting', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'enough', 'can', 'just', 'say', 'cringe', 'whenever', 'screen', 'Also', 'story', 'often', 'disjointed', 'have', 'said', 'same', '2', 'switching', 'story', 'Michael', 'young', 'Vito', 'story', 'occasionally', 'hard', 'follow', 'here', 'continuity', 'not', 'smooth.I', 'suppose', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'Michael', 'nothing', 'really', 'do', 'Pacino', 'acting', 'flawless', 'intense', 'more', 'do', 'wtih', 'character', 'Michael', 'completely', 'different', '1', '2', 'Previously', 'was', 'cold', 'calculating', 'full', 'reason', 'lacking', 'emotion', 'here', 'completely', 'opposite', 'compassionate', 'regretful', 'full', 'sadness', 'pitiful', 'even', 'weak', 'spirit', 'Even', 'tone', 'voice', 'different', 'often', 'playful', 'nature.I', 'understand', 'Coppola', 'wanted', 'manifest', 'change', 'character', 'what', 'think', 'missing', 'what', 'happened', '2', '3', 'cause', 'growth/change/evolution', 'Yes', 'end', 'part', '2', 'Michael', 'had', 'committed', 'ultimate', 'despicable', 'act', 'can', 'guess', 'parting', 'shots', 'face', 'was', 'troubled', 'full', 'regret', 'wondering', 'where', 'went', 'wrong', 'Here', 'made', 'transition', 'almost', 'completely', 'righteous', 'Don', 'regretful', 'old', 'man', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'here.In', 'case', 'are', 'very', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'here', 'mostly', 'involving', 'Garcia', 'Pacino', 'there', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'here', 'end', 'trilogy', 'very', 'strong', 'powerful', 'note', 'too', 'Michael', 'am', 'left', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'greatness', 'was', 'lost', 'here', 'somewhere', 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"
298670,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6302158176,David Baldwin,"[4, 6]","I never understood the animous of so-called ""Godfather"" purists directed against this installment of the trilogy.  For years Francis Ford Coppola resisted efforts to recruit him to make another ""Godfather"" film.  When he did make one it was on the condition that Michael Corleone dies, the only logical conclusion in continuing this story.  The knives were out for the casting of his daughter Sofia in the central role of Mary Corleone.  Now I'm not saying that Sofia is a credible actress but her deficiencies, I felt, were covered up by the more accomplished actors in the cast.  I'm more outraged that people think she is an accomplished director-screenwriter on the basis of the woeful ""Lost in Translation"".  Yes, there are many ridiculous elements to the film, a ludicrous Vatican bank scandal subplot and Talia Shire's scenery-chewing account of Connie Corleone.  That said the positives here outnumber the negatives.  First off, Al Pacino's account of Michael Corleone in the twilight of his life is flawless.  You can see in his face the realization that he's deluded himself that the family business that he headed was a noble enterprise despite his efforts to legitimize it in the eyes of acceptable society.  I also thought there was some discernable chemistry in the scenes he shared with Diane Keaton as Kay.  It's kind of ironic that Pacino wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his work here;instead he was nominated for his role as Big Boy Caprice in ""Dick Tracy"".  Andy Garcia is magnetic as Vincent, Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son.  Joe Mantegna gives a colorful account of Joey Zaza, a John Gotti type.  Look for Catherine Scorsese(Marty's mother) in a small role here.  Not to be missed is Coppola's commentary where he vociferously defends the choices he made for this film, in particular his casting of his own daughter.  He sounds like an overly protective daddy protecting his baby girl from the knives and daggers directed against her.",4,The Saga Ends,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,1960,"['never', 'understood', 'animous', 'so-called', 'Godfather', 'purists', 'directed', 'installment', 'trilogy', 'years', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'resisted', 'efforts', 'recruit', 'make', 'Godfather', 'film', 'When', 'did', 'make', 'one', 'was', 'condition', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'only', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'continuing', 'story', 'knives', 'were', 'out', 'casting', 'daughter', 'Sofia', 'central', 'role', 'Mary', 'Corleone', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Sofia', 'credible', 'actress', 'deficiencies', 'felt', 'were', 'covered', 'up', 'more', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'cast', ""'m"", 'more', 'outraged', 'people', 'think', 'accomplished', 'director-screenwriter', 'basis', 'woeful', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Yes', 'are', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'elements', 'film', 'ludicrous', 'Vatican', 'bank', 'scandal', 'subplot', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'scenery-chewing', 'account', 'Connie', 'Corleone', 'said', 'positives', 'here', 'outnumber', 'negatives', 'First', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'account', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'twilight', 'life', 'flawless', 'can', 'see', 'face', 'realization', 'deluded', 'family', 'business', 'headed', 'was', 'noble', 'enterprise', 'efforts', 'legitimize', 'eyes', 'acceptable', 'society', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'discernable', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'shared', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Kay', 'kind', 'ironic', 'Pacino', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'work', 'here', 'instead', 'was', 'nominated', 'role', 'Big', 'Boy', 'Caprice', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'magnetic', 'Vincent', 'Sonny', 'Corleone', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'colorful', 'account', 'Joey', 'Zaza', 'John', 'Gotti', 'type', 'Look', 'Catherine', 'Scorsese', 'Marty', 'mother', 'small', 'role', 'here', 'Not', 'be', 'missed', 'Coppola', 'commentary', 'where', 'vociferously', 'choices', 'made', 'film', 'particular', 'casting', 'own', 'daughter', 'overly', 'protective', 'daddy', 'protecting', 'baby', 'girl', 'knives', 'daggers', 'directed']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"
298671,APY0VGFBZQ8XS,6302158176,"David C. ""photo pen men""","[1, 2]","Yes it is true, this is the least entertaining of the Godfather Trilogy, however it does have a few sparkles that shine in the darkness. What many people might fail to see is that this film does reflect the nature of transition which took place not only in the Mob, but also in America.The film documents how slowly but surely another generation takes a hold of the reigns, only instead of a worthy successor the torch is passed reluctantly to someone incapable of filling the shoes of the title. It reflects America (and much of Western Culture,) in the fact that we too have been protected for so long from ""the horrors of this world"" that we are not even aware of the proper way to fight them. One gets the sense that Vincent (played by Andy Garcia,) although a very competent leader is not quite up to challenge to take over the Family.For me this was one of the primary shortcomings of the film, yes Sophia was terribly and a waste of film but the real tragedy of this film was the lack of depth to Andy Garcia's character. The man is a supreme actor and could have easily offered an Oscar performance if given the chance. The film should have focused more on Michael attempting to maintain the protection of his family through his sister and his nephew, not as the film really materialized. However, despite that judgement I do believe this film is worth your time.Godfather part III is interesting in that it presents how deep corruption can truly go, it also shows the viewer just how quickly life can become complicated and that sometimes the solution to those complications ends in utter sadness. The film is quite appropiate for the nature of the times in which it was written (the 1990's,) and if it can teach anything to us, it is that we have to live our lives without letting the corruptions and horrors of this world get to us.

While not up to the level of the first two, the movie is still compelling. Michael Corleaone, played by Al Pacino, is trying to go legitimate. He and his foundation are very generous donors to the Vatican. He is attempting to purchase control of an international corporation which has ties to the Vatican. Michael wants his son to work for him but, the son has other ideas, he is an opera singer and he wants his life to be Music. Accordingly, his nephew, Vincent, played by Andy Garcia, becomes his succesor but, he ends up heading criminal operations, not becoming legitimate as his uncle is attempting to do. The legitimate operations remain in te family, however, as Michael's daughter Mary (played by Sofia Coppola) heads the Corleone foundation. Michael and his ex wife Kay (Diane Keaton) even have some wistful moments together as they act in their son's best interest and support his music career.Unfortunately, Michael cannot break away completely from his criminal past. Sofia is in love with her cousin Vincent. As Michael attempts to take control of legitimate operations, his enemies attempt to get control of both the Vatican connections and the international corporation by any means possible. Michael also is sought for advice on criminal operations despite his protestations that he is no longer in that business. This all leads to a climax as we see a plot unfold to eliminate Michael. The ending is not a pat, formulaic ending so, it is a genuinely suspenseful thriller.Michael has softened significatly from his cold brutality in the first two movies. There is a scene in which he confesses his sins. He is now capable of emotion and tears. He also is failing physically as he suffers a minor diabetic stroke. All in all, this movie was nearly as compelling as the first two. There are some problems, however. There is too much that just doesn't ring true. For example, if you do the arithmetic based on the monatary figures of his donation to the Vatican and the costs of buying into the corporation, Michael is easily a billionaire. I have no doubt that heading a crime family can net many tens of millions of dollars but, the sum of money that Michael had in 1979 strains credulity. Also, in typical movie fashion, we see newspapers spinning around and then stopping revealing headlines. These headlines are in busniness sections about Corleone's attempts to purchase a controling interest in the corporation. In real life, Michael's criminal past would not have been forgotten and, therefore, this would not be a business story but, a front page expose' of organized crime takeovers, not a dry business section piece that could just as easily be about Bill Gates and Microsoft.This movie has its weaknesses. It is not what the first two were.

I much preferred &quot;Part III&quot; to &quot;Part II&quot;, feeling that the theme of attempted redemption and reconciliation was extremely powerful. Michael is again trying to keep his family intact, while coming under increasing fire from other organized crime figures (literally). He is consumed with guilt over the &quot;hit&quot; he had ordered on his brother. He is trying to remain connected with his children, and to make amends with his estranged wife. Like &quot;Part II&quot;, this movie does a good job of trying to connect actual historical events with the fictional plot of the film. In this case, the historical sub-plot involves the surprise election and sudden death of Pope John Paul I. The weakest portion of this film (and what may well have cost it the Academy Award) was the foolish decision on the part of Francis Ford Coppola to cast his daughter Sophia in the key role of Michael's daughter.

However his attempts to remove himself from the violent underworld are undermined by power hungry proteges from younger gangsters aiming to take over the family business.This finale in the Godfather Trilogy is the darkest and the most emotional of the three. I don't understand the negative reviews that I read on this movie. This is a fitting conclusion to the saga of Don Michael Corleone. The ending is quite depressing and the movie is dark as MIchael Corleone is experiencing the effects of advancing age.The acting, like in it's two predecessors, is really well-done once again. While Al Pacino is by far the driving force of the entire movie series besides the late Marlon Brando from Part I, others in this cast are also really great as well.

298684,AYTGG6XTVUG7G,6302158176,Douglas A. Greenberg,"[38, 52]","It goes without saying that ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" are two of the greatest films ever produced.  It is the very power, majesty, and near-flawless production qualities of these two epics that render it all the more tragic that ""The Godfather Part III"" turned out so badly.There's no sugarcoating the magnitude of the cinematic disaster that ""Part III"" represents.  Everyone knows how poorly the casting is, particularly the unfortunate last-minute insertion of Sofia Coppola into Winona Ryder's planned role as Michael Corleone's daughter Mary. Her wooden performance and awkward screen presence by themselves deal a near-fatal blow to the film's prospects for success.  Other casting blunders include the inclusion of the bland George Hamilton as a replacement for Robert Duvall as the Corleone legal adviser, and the use of Joe Mantagna to portray the supposedly dangerous gangster Joey Zasa.Even with these problems, any ""Godfather"" sequel featuring such talented performers as Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire should at the very least prove decent.  That the film turns out so horribly reveals that the production problems extend to the plot concept, the writing, and the direction.  The main premise of the film, that an aging Michael Corleone wishes to legitimize himself and put his violent, corrupt past behind him is certainly plausible, as is the notion that a ""next generation"" of gangsters (i.e., Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son Vincent) might be waiting in the wings.  The resulting story, however, is muddled and unsatisfying. It is suggested that shadowy, murky kinds of corruption rattle the walls of the Vatican; we are introduced to entirely new and heretofore unknown underworld factions, which don't poke their nefarious way into the plot until midway through the film. Overall, the story is a kind of multilayered mess with countless loose ends, leaving viewers confused and with way too many ""Yeah, buts.""Perhaps even worse than the tortuous story line is the film's presentation and pacing. Whereas first-rate dialogue, camera work, and editing caused the previous two ""Godfathers"" to sizzle from start to finish, this film exhibits a staid, plodding quality that by the last forty minutes or so has slowed to a veritable cinematic crawl. I swear that during the gratuitous scenes in Sicily in which Kay and Michael sit endlessly at a table reminiscing about the old days it's all I can do to keep from falling asleep.  Part of the problem, in fact, is that so much of the film feeds shamelessly off the energies generated by the previous two releases.  The endless recollection, reflection, and hagiographic dredging up of old Corleone family homilies permeates and nearly engulfs the entire project, leaving little that is new or distinctive that can be identified with the ""Part III"" production.The film does have its moments, including a powerful final scene ...  But such moments are too few and far between.  Overall, this is a bloated turkey of a production which demonstrates that the sixteen-year interval between ""Part II"" and ""Part III"" was simply too long to sustain the creative energy that rendered the original ""Godfather"" films so successful.  Frankly, it would have been better for the moviegoing public, for Francis Ford Coppola, and certainly for his daughter Sofia had ""The Godfather Part III"" simply never been made.",2,No revisionism!

298686,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,6302158176,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","The first two Godfather movies are classics, two of the best movies ever. They have rich character development, tight plots, and brilliant acting.That's everything Godfather III doesn't have.I think the biggest problem is that the movie takes place 20 years after Godfather II. It's just too much time and the characters have changed so much. I understand what Coppola was trying to do - he wanted to show an older Michael worried about his soul. However, it just doesn't work. Michael seems more like a doddering old man than the cold, ruthless man we grew to know. We don't see the evolution, and as such don't feel the emotional drama of Michael's quest for forgiveness.The film is filled with a lot of new characters who don't have the audience's love and respect the way that the original characters do. It would have been OK if the new characters were as compelling as the original ones, but they're not. They're shallow and superficial. In particular, Andy Garcia as Sonny's son takes up way too much screen time. The movie could have been subtitled the ""Andy Garcia"" show. He comes across more like Joey from Friends than Sonny from the Godfather. It seems extremely contrived that Michael would suddenly take him on as a son at the beginning of the movie. Same with Sophia Coppola as Michael's daughter. I guess the two characters were designed to add a ""youth"" element to the film, but they add nothing to the story.The script is also a bit too ""on the nose"". Where Godfathers I & II were notable for their remarkable use of silence and facial expressions to convey emotions, Godfather II has several monologues.  Michael has several confession scenes which again don't have the emotional impact they should.I'm glad I did eventually watch this movie, only because I was curious to see Michael's death. That said, Godfather II ends on such a powerful note that I think it says everything that needed to be said about Michael Corleone.

298688,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,6302158176,Eric S. Kim,"[11, 14]","The Godfather Part III suffers from the marvels of the first two films. Brando, De Niro, Caan, Duvall, and many other stars are absent. The Mafia is no longer the central part of this story. And it's actually hard to understand this film without watching the first two films. But does that mean it fails to be a movie overall? Of course, not.Despite being the weakest in the trilogy, The Godfather Part III makes for a powerful conclusion to this epic saga. It's now 1979, and Michael Corleone is diagnosed with diabetes. He's separated from his wife, and his children are estranged. For years, Michael has felt guilt from not only isolating himself from his own family, but also having his brother Fredo killed. Now, he wants to go perfectly legitimate with his risky business. As you can see, this has now become a tale of redemption and forgiveness.Francis Ford Coppola does what he does best here. He moves the story along, with some interesting and powerful elements that have not been found in the first two films. The script is still brilliant the third time around; I don't think you can improve anything here. The music sounds reused, but they still become an important aspect in every scene that requires it.Of course, we cannot forget the cast (whether good or bad). Al Pacino is as amazing as ever. He's still superior in the first two films, but here, we get to see more emotion and more skill. The last two scenes are especially powerful; it still gets me a bit teary-eyed. Diane Keaton is still spectacular as Kay; same goes for Talia Shire as Connie. Andy Garcia becomes a welcome addition in the cast. He's perfect as the late Sonny's son, Vincent. It's very amusing to see Joe Mantegna as Joey Zasa . . . especially if you try hard not to envision him as Fat Tony. Donal Donnelly as the Archbishop can be best described as extraordinary: he's believable alright. B.J. Harrison as the Corleones' new adviser isn't really as great as Robert Duvall in the first two films, but he can still manage to make us appreciate his performance. Finally, we come to Sofia Coppola as Mary. Countless people find her dull and wooden, easily the worst performance in the entire trilogy. While I do find her wooden, she really makes it more authentic. She is oblivious to what's going on in her father's business; she's more of a simpleton rather than an expert in the Mafia business. And I think Sofia pretty much fits that personality here.It's true that The Godfather Part III is not in the same league as the first two classic installments, but this is still a fitting conclusion, and it is an extraordinary movie. Just make sure you've seen Godfather I and II before you see this one.Grade: A-",5,"""When they come . . . they come at what you love.""",1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,2699,"['Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'suffers', 'marvels', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Brando', 'De', 'Niro', 'Caan', 'Duvall', 'many', 'other', 'stars', 'are', 'absent', 'Mafia', 'no', 'longer', 'central', 'part', 'story', 'actually', 'hard', 'understand', 'film', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'mean', 'be', 'movie', 'overall', 'course', 'not.Despite', 'being', 'weakest', 'trilogy', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'powerful', 'conclusion', 'epic', 'saga', 'now', '1979', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'diagnosed', 'diabetes', 'separated', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'estranged', 'years', 'Michael', 'felt', 'guilt', 'not', 'only', 'isolating', 'own', 'family', 'also', 'having', 'brother', 'Fredo', 'killed', 'Now', 'go', 'perfectly', 'legitimate', 'risky', 'business', 'can', 'see', 'now', 'become', 'tale', 'redemption', 'forgiveness.Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'what', 'best', 'here', 'story', 'interesting', 'powerful', 'elements', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'found', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'script', 'still', 'brilliant', 'third', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'improve', 'anything', 'here', 'music', 'reused', 'still', 'become', 'important', 'aspect', 'scene', 'it.Of', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'cast', 'good', 'bad', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'as', 'amazing', 'ever', 'still', 'superior', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'here', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'emotion', 'more', 'skill', 'last', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'especially', 'powerful', 'still', 'bit', 'teary-eyed', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'still', 'spectacular', 'Kay', 'same', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Connie', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'welcome', 'addition', 'cast', 'perfect', 'late', 'Sonny', 'son', 'Vincent', 'very', 'amusing', 'see', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'Joey', 'Zasa', 'especially', 'try', 'hard', 'not', 'envision', 'Fat', 'Tony', 'Donal', 'Donnelly', 'Archbishop', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'extraordinary', 'believable', 'alright', 'B.J', 'Harrison', 'Corleones', 'new', 'adviser', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'great', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'can', 'still', 'manage', 'make', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'Finally', 'come', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Mary', 'Countless', 'people', 'find', 'dull', 'wooden', 'easily', 'worst', 'performance', 'entire', 'trilogy', 'do', 'find', 'wooden', 'really', 'more', 'authentic', 'oblivious', 'what', 'going', 'father', 'business', 'more', 'simpleton', 'rather', 'expert', 'Mafia', 'business', 'think', 'Sofia', 'pretty', 'much', 'fits', 'personality', 'here.It', 'true', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'first', 'two', 'classic', 'installments', 'still', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'extraordinary', 'movie', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Godfather', 'II', 'see', 'one.Grade', 'A-']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

298692,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,6302158176,F. S. L'hoir,"[16, 21]","I confess it! ""Godfather III"" is one of my favorite movies. All right, it has less-than-perfect moments, but it also has memorable ones, such as the touching confessional scene between Michael (Al Pacino) and the Cardinal (Raf Vallone) in the cloister, and the reconciliation of Michael and Kay (Diane Keaton) in Don Tommasino's dining room.I especially enjoy the Italian locations, and since I spent the `80s in Italy, amidst rumors about what was commonly regarded as the suspicious death of John Paul I; the scandals of the Vatican Banco Ambrosiano (with the banker Calvi hanging from the London bridge); the P-2 scandals in the highest posts of the government, not to mention numerous assassinations of judges in Sicily, the background of the story--the last half of which takes place in Sicily--rang true for me. Furthermore--and more importantly--Coppola's brilliant use of recurrent visual and thematic imagery renders the film outstanding not only on its own merits but also in respect to the first two films. Besides the well-discussed use of oranges whenever a catastrophe is imminent, Coppola constantly juxtaposes themes of religion and death, replicating the events of the story--the biting of the ear; the religious procession, the veiling of the head--with those of Mascagni's magnificent opera about death, revenge, and religion in Sicily: ""Cavalleria Rusticana."" Coppola intersperses scenes of the opera with scenes of actual vendetta, as the plans of Vincenzo--the new godfather--are carried to their violent conclusion. The part I love the best, though, is when Coppola transfers the tragedy taking place onstage in the opera, outside onto the steps of the opera house--life imitating art. That final choreographed scene, staged to the heart-rending music of Mascagni, gets me every time (Please pass some more Kleenex tissue!).Al Pacino's silent scream on the steps of the opera house embodies the mask of Greek tragedy. And tragic irony renders ""Godfather III"" particularly powerful, when the film is viewed in the context of the whole. For instance, the preservation of the family is the device that moves the plot of the entire trilogy. The crimes committed first by Vito Corleone and then by Michael are committed in order to keep the family safe, even though the meaning of 'family' becomes distorted from its original significance during the course of the trilogy. In ""Godfather III,"" however, the aging Michael, who is trying to become a pillar of society in order to preserve his immediate family, accomplishes the very opposite of what he intended. The final scenes of ""Godfather I"" and ""Godfather III""--both set in gardens--emphasize the tragedy. Whereas Vito Corleone dies in the garden, alone except for the youngest member of the family--his toddler grandson--at his feet, Michael Corleone dies in the garden, alone--except for a dog at his feet. Classic examples of tragic irony!I wish that Coppola would reprise his ""Godfather Saga"" which he made for television in the seventies. He reshuffled the scenes so that the narrative ran in chronological order from the funeral of Vito's father in Sicily at the beginning of ""Godfather I"" to the shooting of Fredo at end of ""Godfather II."" In combination with this particular format, ""Godfather III"" would make an especially effective tragic finish to the trilogy. The entire saga would then recall the Greek dramatist Aeschylus's trilogy. The original saga of family and its disintegration through revenge and murder, ""The Oresteia"" depicts the fall of the House of Atreus, just as the Godfather trilogy depicts the fall of the House of Corleone.When I once made this observation to my daughter, she gave me a sarcastic look and said: ""Mom, you're over-educated!""Mea Culpa!",5,The Fall of the House of Corleone,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3752,"['confess', 'Godfather', 'III', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'right', 'less-than-perfect', 'moments', 'also', 'memorable', 'ones', 'such', 'touching', 'confessional', 'scene', 'Michael', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Cardinal', 'Raf', 'Vallone', 'cloister', 'reconciliation', 'Michael', 'Kay', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Don', 'Tommasino', 'dining', 'room.I', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'Italian', 'locations', 'spent', '80s', 'Italy', 'amidst', 'rumors', 'what', 'was', 'commonly', 'regarded', 'suspicious', 'death', 'John', 'Paul', 'scandals', 'Vatican', 'Banco', 'Ambrosiano', 'banker', 'Calvi', 'hanging', 'London', 'bridge', 'P-2', 'scandals', 'highest', 'posts', 'government', 'not', 'mention', 'numerous', 'assassinations', 'judges', 'Sicily', 'background', 'story', 'last', 'half', 'place', 'Sicily', 'rang', 'true', 'Furthermore', 'more', 'importantly', 'Coppola', 'brilliant', 'use', 'recurrent', 'visual', 'thematic', 'imagery', 'film', 'outstanding', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'merits', 'also', 'respect', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'well-discussed', 'use', 'oranges', 'whenever', 'catastrophe', 'imminent', 'Coppola', 'constantly', 'themes', 'religion', 'death', 'replicating', 'events', 'story', 'biting', 'ear', 'religious', 'procession', 'veiling', 'head', 'Mascagni', 'magnificent', 'opera', 'death', 'revenge', 'religion', 'Sicily', 'Cavalleria', 'Rusticana', 'Coppola', 'scenes', 'opera', 'scenes', 'actual', 'vendetta', 'plans', 'Vincenzo', 'new', 'godfather', 'are', 'carried', 'violent', 'conclusion', 'part', 'love', 'best', 'though', 'when', 'Coppola', 'tragedy', 'taking', 'place', 'onstage', 'opera', 'steps', 'opera', 'house', 'life', 'imitating', 'art', 'final', 'choreographed', 'scene', 'staged', 'heart-rending', 'music', 'Mascagni', 'time', 'Please', 'pass', 'more', 'Kleenex', 'tissue', '.Al', 'Pacino', 'silent', 'scream', 'steps', 'opera', 'house', 'mask', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'tragic', 'irony', 'renders', 'Godfather', 'III', 'particularly', 'powerful', 'when', 'film', 'viewed', 'context', 'whole', 'instance', 'preservation', 'family', 'device', 'plot', 'entire', 'trilogy', 'crimes', 'committed', 'first', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'then', 'Michael', 'are', 'committed', 'order', 'keep', 'family', 'safe', 'even', 'meaning', ""'family"", 'becomes', 'distorted', 'original', 'significance', 'course', 'trilogy', 'Godfather', 'III', 'however', 'aging', 'Michael', 'who', 'trying', 'become', 'pillar', 'society', 'order', 'preserve', 'immediate', 'family', 'very', 'opposite', 'what', 'intended', 'final', 'scenes', 'Godfather', 'Godfather', 'III', 'set', 'gardens', 'emphasize', 'tragedy', 'Whereas', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'garden', 'alone', 'youngest', 'member', 'family', 'toddler', 'grandson', 'feet', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'garden', 'alone', 'dog', 'feet', 'Classic', 'examples', 'tragic', 'irony', 'wish', 'Coppola', 'would', 'reprise', 'Godfather', 'Saga', 'made', 'television', 'seventies', 'reshuffled', 'scenes', 'narrative', 'ran', 'chronological', 'order', 'funeral', 'Vito', 'father', 'Sicily', 'beginning', 'Godfather', 'shooting', 'Fredo', 'end', 'Godfather', 'II', 'combination', 'particular', 'format', 'Godfather', 'III', 'would', 'make', 'especially', 'effective', 'tragic', 'finish', 'trilogy', 'entire', 'saga', 'would', 'then', 'recall', 'Greek', 'dramatist', 'Aeschylus', 'trilogy', 'original', 'saga', 'family', 'disintegration', 'revenge', 'murder', 'Oresteia', 'fall', 'House', 'Atreus', 'just', 'Godfather', 'trilogy', 'fall', 'House', 'Corleone.When', 'once', 'made', 'observation', 'daughter', 'gave', 'sarcastic', 'look', 'said', 'Mom', ""'re"", 'over-educated', 'Mea', 'Culpa']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"
298693,ALSNA5840Z14,6302158176,fujiyama,"[2, 3]","This review has spoilers of Godfather Part I and II:I'll go ahead and rate this film after having seen it recently after seeing before several years ago. I think I can more fairly judge this film now, considering for some time I was extremely bitter for Paramount having a ""behind the scenes"" promo BEFORE the VHS version of the feature film, which actually showed scenes of the ENDING! Needless to say, giving spoilers of the film before playing it, ruins a film. Fortunately, DVDs have menus so no studio in their right mind would do such a thing.Granted, this wasn't the greatest movie, or even a great movie. But it is good and better than 90% of films out there. But it doesn't match up with the other two films in any way. Adding to the fact that this movie was undoubtadly a disappointment (after watching the first two beforehand for the first time), the spoilers really turned me off this film.But that was a while ago, and when I saw this again recently, I had forgotten the exact details and focused more on the storyline , acting, and other merits.I'll start off by saying that Pacino's acting in this film, as in the first two parts is great. At times he seems a bit over the top, but he conveys the emotions of a regretful old man haunted by his past crimes, especially the killing of his brother Fredo. I actually think his acting in this was better than his acting in ""Scent of a Woman"", which he won an Academy Award for.Anyways, the rest of the plot is interesting and involves the Vatican. It's actually not a bad plot.I think what ruins this film for many are two things: Sophia Copolla's wretched acting and the bizarre incest relationship between her character and her cousin's. Copolla is even worse an acress than she is a director (granted I've only seen one - ""Lost in Translation"" which I found terribly overrated). She wasn't ready for such a major role as this in her first acting job.But looking past the relationship and the terrible acting by Sophia, I still don't believe this to be a terrible film. It's not a film you'll see as many times as the originals (which never get old), but it's worth a viewing or two. And that makes it worth three stars IMO.But I can't fault those that would recommend only the first two and pan this (it may be better looked as the first and second being one very large epic film and having it end there for those that are also fan of the original Godfather novel by Puzo  - which never covered anything that was in this film).

It was a spellbinding story, that is remarkable not for the evil it portrays, but in that it shows the small moves toward evil that lead us on a course that ends up in a personal hell.For me Part III is an essential part of the story, showing that there is no good to come from a deal with the devil. Karma, Fate, what have you, will require payment sooner or later, and the Godfather ends up as a wonderfully poignant tragedy, rather that a cops and robbers kind of crime story.For me the crux of the whole trilogy comes with Don Michael's confession to his ex-wife that all he ever wanted was to protect his family, and in the end he lost them anyway, paired with the final tragic event in the story, the heartbreaking reality, that in the end, someone always has to pay.So here's the deal, don't bother to watch Part III without seeing the other two parts first, preferably in a marathon viewing, but if you watch it as part of the whole, you will probably find it a moving end to the saga.",5,Is it worth it?,1226534400,"11 13, 2008",2008,1257,"['Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'great', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'other', 'two', 'parts', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'happy', 'it.My', 'sweetheart', 'reluctantly', 'part', 'watched', 'three', 'parts', 'row', 'first', 'time', 'summer', 'was', 'spellbinding', 'story', 'remarkable', 'not', 'evil', 'small', 'moves', 'evil', 'lead', 'course', 'up', 'personal', 'hell.For', 'Part', 'III', 'essential', 'part', 'story', 'showing', 'good', 'come', 'deal', 'devil', 'Karma', 'Fate', 'what', 'have', 'will', 'require', 'payment', 'sooner', 'later', 'Godfather', 'up', 'wonderfully', 'poignant', 'tragedy', 'rather', 'cops', 'robbers', 'kind', 'crime', 'story.For', 'crux', 'whole', 'trilogy', 'Don', 'Michael', 'confession', 'ex-wife', 'ever', 'wanted', 'was', 'protect', 'family', 'end', 'lost', 'anyway', 'paired', 'final', 'tragic', 'event', 'story', 'heartbreaking', 'reality', 'end', 'someone', 'always', 'pay.So', 'here', 'deal', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watch', 'Part', 'III', 'seeing', 'other', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'preferably', 'marathon', 'viewing', 'watch', 'part', 'whole', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'moving', 'end', 'saga']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

Coppola had Pacino and Brando both play 'Godfather' without having to resort to profanity, until this film.  The inclusion of George Hamilton does not make up for the screen presence of Robert Duvall--Tom Hagen is sorely missed.  And Joe Mantegna could have easily been replaced by either Chazz Palminteri or Armand Assante (just to name a few), both of whom could have brought forward a bit more charisma to the role of Joey Zaza.The whole subplot of redemption through legalization of the Family holdings is fine--it makes total sense, even if it isn't all that interesting.  My favourite moments came when Pacino was playing Michael at his lowest moments, particularly the confessional scene.The cinematography is a big plus; the film often looks--particularly in the second half--beautiful, and as usual, Nino Rota's score is never less than totally effective.  The other is the inclusion of Andy Garcia as Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son Vincent--he got a well-deserved Oscar nod for this film.By the end, however, the film just can't sustain any momentum it ever gets, and we're left thinking it's a letdown, especially when held up to the first two films.

Don Corleone goes into the  olive oil business, what else would you expect?  He soon learns that it is easier to make money on the wrong side of the law and recruits a small gang of fellow Sicilians.In Part III, Al Pacino returns once again to the role of Don Michael Corleone. In this film, Corleone tries to go legitimate. He purchases an Italian company previously owned by The Vatican. He is given a medal by The Vatican, and believes he is on the path to being legitimate. His nephew, played well by Andy Garcia is being trained by his uncle to one day head the family. The Corleones soon learn there are traitors in The Vatican. Corleone tries to find the traitor legally. Upon the Pope's death, he finds a group of high-ranking Vatican officials, are his traitors. This group is headed by Bishop Lombardo, who has just been named Pope John Paul I. He then rids himself of that problem, and believes to be on the right path again. Just as he starts to feel comfortable with legitimate life, a tragedy occurs. Leaving an old Corleone devastated, this is a tragic end to a wonderful film.There are a million stories that whirl around THE GODFATHER.

It just suffers in the shadow of its great predecessors, and from an overwrought and clunky ending.  For the most part, I enjoyed the film.Pacino gives a great performance and is the real reason to watch this.  That said, too many things end up being too conveniently executed.  Some moments between the characters could have been further developed for greater credibility - for that is where the film suffers.  Andy Garcia gets a lot of screen time, but is improbable as the trigger happy hotshot who's both suave yet totally ruthless and unstable.  He doesn't have the gravitas in some respects, but looks good on screen.  This is where later films like Eastern Promises with Viggo Mortensen go one up on realism.  Sofia Coppola is the ""flower vase"" as some might call her.  She looks fine, but again, is underdeveloped.  In retrospect, Francis Ford Coppola could have done better if he was aiming for the King Lear allegory (which he was) and given us more of a reason to relate to her as a character.  While believable enough as his daughter, she never really makes an impact on us. And as an actress, she's definitely too novice for this role.Still, one can't deny the Godfather feel of the film.  Beautiful set pieces, nice dialogue,...for the most part the film works.But the ending is so improbable, it felt like a bad James Bond plot to kill Saddam Hussain in the space of 15 minutes.

Although the plot gets somewhat byzantine near the end and Al Pacino's ""silent scream"" should have been edited out, I thought the movie held up well with the first two and was a respectable third sequel to the first and second movies. Imagine my surprise when I read the critics and learn that I'm supposed to hate this awful movie, that Sofia Coppola cannot act and that Andy Garcia does an awful job as well, blah, blah, blah. I suspect that if Mr. Coppola had not directed I and II-- is he a victim of his success?-- that the critics would have given him rave reviews. Instead of comparing this one up to the first two, why don't we look at the other movies released (1990?) that year and see how this one measures up to them. The criticism of Ms. Coppola is ill-founded. She is quite good as Michael Corleone's child Mary. The daughter in THE SOPRANOS bears a striking resemblance to her and surely is modeled in part on her. Mr. Garcia is a terrific actor and  brings new meaning to the phrase, handsome Italian men. Diane Keaton is superb here as Michael Corleone's ex-wife who never stopped loving him, at least on some level. Finally Al Pacino gives a heartbreaking performance as the aging head of the Corleone family who struggles unsuccessfully to die a respectable man.All the elements from the first two productions are here, the wonderful crowd scenes, the interweaving of criminal acts with religious services, the juxtaposition of the most heinous acts on earth with holy observances. (Here the poison goes all the way to the Vatican.) On the other hand, both of the Corleone children break the cycle of murder and violence: Mary manages her father's charitable organization and Tony makes his operatic debut in Sicily in quite a grand section of the movie.Damn the critics; they are wrong.

While it retains the same high production values and attention to detail, and contains some powerful scenes, the storyline of 'Part III' is haphazard and the acting very hit-and-miss.The plot revolves around an older Michael Corleone achieving his goal of making the family business (almost) completely legitimate, despite the reluctance of family, associates, and ""friends"" to let him walk away from his criminal past. This had the potential to be really engaging, but the film quickly dissolves into a series of side stories that are under-developed and don't really fit that well together. Instead of the complex interlocking sub-plots of Parts I and II, this film feels much looser and more fragmented; it's more like a series of individual scenes than a coherent narrative. Secondly, far too much time is devoted to the clumsy forbidden-romance subplot between Michael's daughter Mary and his nephew Vincent. This might not have been quite so bad had the two characters shown the slightest chemistry, but as it stands it just feels forced and awkward. Finally, the dodgy Vatican deal at the heart of the film just wasn't that interesting; ""legitimate"" business transactions, no matter how hard-nosed and complex, just don't have the same attraction as the criminal scheming and manipulation we saw in Parts I and II.Unfortunately, the weaknesses in the story are only emphasised by the inconsistent performances. Some people criticise Pacino's performance here, and it's true that this Michael is very different to the character in Parts I and II. However, this suits the film, with Michael coming across as a man who has mellowed significantly with age, and seeking to atone for (or at least face up to) the terrible things he has done in the past. I also really liked Talia Shire in this one; instead of the flaky victim of the first two films, she is ruthless and determined here, almost a Godmother-like figure in her own right. Andy Garcia I thought was hit-and-miss as Vincent, he nails it as the suave gangster type, but is less convincing in the ""hot-headed"" scenes. And Sophia Coppola is definitely the weak link here, although to be fair her character wasn't that interesting to start with. These four apart, and in contrast to the first two films, none of the other characters were particularly memorable or distinctive, with the mobsters in particular tending to blend into one another. The film badly misses Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, who would have fitted perfectly into the central conflict about staying legitimate or seeking personal revenge.What saves `Part III' to some extent is the climax, which is even more tragic and poignant than that of `Part II' because Michael is more of a ""good"" character this time around. Michael has spent the bulk of the film genuinely trying to make things right after a lifetime of wrong-doing, yet still ends up suffering a loss even more devastating than before. Some might regard the climax as Michael's deserved come-uppance, and there is something to be said for him paying for his past sins. But the tone is overwhelmingly sympathetic, with the very final montage of scenes re-inforcing the immense losses Michael has suffered throughout his entire life.These final scenes do at least give the entire Godfather saga an appropriate closure, and `Part III' is almost worth watching for the last 20 minutes alone. But that apart, `Part III' is easily the weakest of the three films, not only in comparison to the first two but also on its own merits. While the technical aspects of the film are still strong, and the film is as ambitious as its predecessors, it's too unfocussed and inconsistent to be a true success. A tighter script and more inspired casting choices could well have elevated Part III into the same category as Parts I and II. As it stands, there are just too many flaws here to ignore.",3,A brilliant climax in need of a film to go with it.,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,3985,"['matter', 'way', 'look', 'third', 'instalment', ""'Godfather"", 'series', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'same', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'attention', 'detail', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'storyline', ""'Part"", 'III', 'haphazard', 'acting', 'very', 'hit-and-miss.The', 'plot', 'revolves', 'older', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'achieving', 'goal', 'making', 'family', 'business', 'almost', 'completely', 'legitimate', 'reluctance', 'family', 'associates', 'friends', 'let', 'walk', 'away', 'criminal', 'past', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'really', 'engaging', 'film', 'quickly', 'series', 'side', 'stories', 'are', 'under-developed', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'well', 'together', 'Instead', 'complex', 'interlocking', 'sub-plots', 'Parts', 'II', 'film', 'much', 'looser', 'more', 'fragmented', 'more', 'series', 'individual', 'scenes', 'coherent', 'narrative', 'Secondly', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'devoted', 'clumsy', 'forbidden-romance', 'subplot', 'Michael', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'nephew', 'Vincent', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'two', 'characters', 'shown', 'slightest', 'chemistry', 'just', 'feels', 'forced', 'awkward', 'Finally', 'dodgy', 'Vatican', 'deal', 'heart', 'film', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'legitimate', 'business', 'transactions', 'matter', 'how', 'hard-nosed', 'complex', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'attraction', 'criminal', 'scheming', 'manipulation', 'saw', 'Parts', 'II.Unfortunately', 'weaknesses', 'story', 'are', 'only', 'emphasised', 'inconsistent', 'performances', 'people', 'criticise', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'here', 'true', 'Michael', 'very', 'different', 'character', 'Parts', 'II', 'However', 'suits', 'film', 'Michael', 'coming', 'across', 'man', 'who', 'mellowed', 'significantly', 'age', 'seeking', 'atone', 'least', 'face', 'up', 'terrible', 'things', 'done', 'past', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'one', 'instead', 'flaky', 'victim', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'ruthless', 'determined', 'here', 'almost', 'Godmother-like', 'figure', 'own', 'right', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'thought', 'was', 'hit-and-miss', 'Vincent', 'suave', 'gangster', 'type', 'less', 'convincing', 'hot-headed', 'scenes', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'definitely', 'weak', 'link', 'here', 'be', 'fair', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'start', 'four', 'apart', 'contrast', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'none', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'distinctive', 'mobsters', 'particular', 'tending', 'blend', 'one', 'film', 'badly', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'fitted', 'perfectly', 'central', 'conflict', 'staying', 'legitimate', 'seeking', 'personal', 'revenge.What', 'Part', 'III', 'extent', 'climax', 'even', 'more', 'tragic', 'poignant', 'Part', 'II', 'Michael', 'more', 'good', 'character', 'time', 'around', 'Michael', 'spent', 'bulk', 'film', 'genuinely', 'trying', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'lifetime', 'wrong-doing', 'still', 'up', 'suffering', 'loss', 'even', 'more', 'devastating', 'before', 'might', 'regard', 'climax', 'Michael', 'deserved', 'come-uppance', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'paying', 'past', 'sins', 'tone', 'overwhelmingly', 'sympathetic', 'very', 'final', 'montage', 'scenes', 're-inforcing', 'immense', 'losses', 'Michael', 'suffered', 'entire', 'life.These', 'final', 'scenes', 'do', 'least', 'give', 'entire', 'Godfather', 'saga', 'appropriate', 'closure', 'Part', 'III', 'almost', 'worth', 'watching', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'alone', 'apart', 'Part', 'III', 'easily', 'weakest', 'three', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'comparison', 'first', 'two', 'also', 'own', 'merits', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'strong', 'film', 'as', 'ambitious', 'predecessors', 'too', 'unfocussed', 'inconsistent', 'be', 'true', 'success', 'tighter', 'script', 'more', 'inspired', 'casting', 'choices', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'elevated', 'Part', 'III', 'same', 'category', 'Parts', 'II', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'here', 'ignore']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

Alvi,"[1, 2]","All three parts of The Godfather series are excellent (and long!) classics, each with its own distinctive feel, and I think Part III is a worthy and fitting closure to the series.  This movie has the emotional intensity of an Italian opera from start to finish, and the ending delivers heartbreak on par with a Greek tragedy.  As one would expect, the composition and execution of the movie are excellent, and others have already commented on the relevant details, so let me instead focus on some of the messages of the movie:1. You can become very wealthy as a criminal if you're smart, motivated, disciplined, have the support of an organization, and are reasonably lucky.2. By getting involved in crime, you endanger your loved ones, not just yourself, and you may wind up paying the ultimate price.3. Money and power have limited value if they come at the expense of relationships with loved ones.4. When a lot of money is at stake, beware of corruption, including in religious organizations.5. Once someone gets deeply involved in crime, it's very difficult to escape from that world, since ties with other criminals will tend to pull one back in.6. There's no honor among theives.7. If you've reached the point where your situation is good, quit while you're ahead, rather than being tempted to risk what you have for the sake of insatiable greed and/or ambition.I certainly highly recommend this movie, but be sure to watch the three parts in sequence.",5,A worthy and fitting closure to a classic series,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,1459,"['three', 'parts', 'Godfather', 'series', 'are', 'excellent', 'long', 'classics', 'own', 'distinctive', 'feel', 'think', 'Part', 'III', 'worthy', 'fitting', 'closure', 'series', 'movie', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'Italian', 'opera', 'start', 'finish', 'ending', 'delivers', 'heartbreak', 'par', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'composition', 'execution', 'movie', 'are', 'excellent', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'commented', 'relevant', 'details', 'so', 'let', 'instead', 'focus', 'messages', 'movie:1', 'can', 'become', 'very', 'wealthy', 'criminal', ""'re"", 'smart', 'motivated', 'disciplined', 'have', 'support', 'organization', 'are', 'reasonably', 'lucky.2', 'getting', 'involved', 'crime', 'endanger', 'loved', 'ones', 'not', 'just', 'may', 'wind', 'up', 'paying', 'ultimate', 'price.3', 'Money', 'power', 'have', 'limited', 'value', 'come', 'expense', 'relationships', 'loved', 'ones.4', 'When', 'lot', 'money', 'stake', 'beware', 'corruption', 'including', 'religious', 'organizations.5', 'Once', 'someone', 'deeply', 'involved', 'crime', 'very', 'difficult', 'escape', 'world', 'ties', 'other', 'criminals', 'will', 'tend', 'pull', 'one', 'back', 'in.6', 'honor', 'theives.7', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'situation', 'good', 'quit', ""'re"", 'ahead', 'rather', 'being', 'tempted', 'risk', 'what', 'have', 'sake', 'insatiable', 'greed', 'and/or', 'certainly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'three', 'parts', 'sequence']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"
298705,A19JYLHD94K94D,6302158176,Itamar Katz,"[4, 5]","Frequently attacked and constantly underappreciated, The Godfather, Part III is often, and unfairly, referred to as one of the biggest disappointments in the history of cinema. When comparing - and I suppose a comparison is inevitable - The Godfather, Part III is certainly not quite as strong as the first two films, both of which are classic masterpieces, practically flawless, to be found in any respectful list of all-time best movies. It was largely a failure both commercially and critically (being nominated for seven Oscars but receiving none). Nevertheless, Part III is a fantastic drama, as good a crime drama as Scorsese's 'Goodfellas', which was released that same year and received much more critical acclaim; certainly the last great film Francis Ford Coppola had directed yet (hopes for 'Youth Without Youth', which has a late 2006 release date). Just like The Godfather, Part II achieved greatness by not trying to recapture the original but being an entirely separate and unique creation, so Part III is a separate creation that stands by its own right, and while it's a continuation of the first two films, it does nothing to subtract from their greatness as some sequels do. The Godfather can work perfectly as a single film, as a two-parter, or as a trilogy; it's a wonderful saga either way.In many ways, The Godfather, Part III, is closer in its spirit to the first film than to the second. International affairs take second place to character development and human insight. Part III, however, focuses on the character of Michael Corleone deeper than any of the other films. It's debatable whether or not Al Pacino's performance here is stronger here than in Part II - it's clear that he's more experienced and mature an actor than he was in 1974, though he may have lost just a bit of his edge. But while in Part II we saw Michael as a decent man gradually turning into a monster, all the while focusing on his life in comparison with his father, Part III delves more deeply into his soul; the influences of Shakespeare and Sophocles are stronger than ever before, as Michael turns into a tragic hero in the classic Greek sense of the words, a man with, ultimately, good intentions, brought down to his tragic end by fate and by his own flaws. Michael is more human and more pitiable in Part III than ever before, and Pacino is certainly up to the task. Comparisons to Vito are certainly there (watch Michael talk some sense into Vincent, just like Vito did to Sonny in the first film) but they're no longer the focus of the film; this film is about Michael, and so Pacino's performance here is more impressive than in the first two parts.The rest of the cast is fantastic (although there aren't any actors in the caliber of Brando, De Niro, Caan or Duvall - who was supposed to be in the film but backed out), but other than Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, who reprise their roles from the previous films excellently, the real revelation here is Andy Garcia, who plays Vincent, illegitimate son of Michael's eldest brother Sonny, and friend-of-the-family Lucy Mancini (the affair between Lucy and Sonny is referred to very briefly in the first film, although it plays a large and important part in the original novel). The role of Vincent Corleone is certainly the strongest in Garcia's career, and his only Oscar-nominated one; Vincent is wonderfully reminiscent of his father (played by James Caan in the first film), and he plays an important part of shedding light on the character of Michael Corleone, while never quite stealing the show from Pacino, clearly the center of the story. Also commendable are performances by George Hamilton, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda and Eli Wallach.There has been much debate about Sofia Coppola's performance as Michael's daughter Mary, so here's my angle on it: it's quite bad indeed, and Sofia proves beyond doubt that she's not an actress. With a lesser cast around her, it wouldn't seem as bad, but next to actors like Pacino, Garcia and Keaton, Coppola seems totally out of place. However, it does little to hurt the film; Mary's part in the film is quite big, but she's mainly there to shed light on Michael and Vincent, and Sofia's less than mediocre performance is ignorable. Thankfully, she quit acting afterwards, and moved on to directing, a field in which she shows much more promise; in fact, the young Miss Coppola shows signs of being one of the most promising young directors of the new millennium.The Godfather, Part III is a fascinating and thrilling tale, and the last forty five minutes are as gripping as any scene in the first two films; Coppola's directing is as inspired and sensitive as it ever was before, and the dialog is all spotless, believable and captivating. The reference to the death of Pope John Paul I, who died only 33 days after being indicted and whose death remains something of a mystery, is a nice touch, which helps create the sense of realism that was an important aspect of the first two films. It's not as timeless a masterpiece as The Godfather and The Godfather, Part II, but if you loved the first two films, you should by all means watch this third installment, too.",5,"Just when I think

They have sold their casinos andgambling institutions, they have never been in drugs or prostitutionand the new Godfather, Michael Corleone, wants to get respectable,recognized by the catholic church and world influential. So he tries todonate big quantities of money to the Vatican bank in exchange of amajority share in the Vatican's real estate institution. He fails atfirst but goes on and tries to find the invisible ways into thelabyrinth. So he makes friends with as many people as possible in thefinancial, religious and political circles around the church. He findsout he has to go to Sicilia to get in touch with an important cardinalwho is actually elected Pope, but does not last more than a few months.They have special teas that make you sleep very long in the Vatican.But this third part shows a great evolution of the Sicilian-Americanand Italian-American communities in the US. Violence is becoming lessand less easy in the US. They have to respect the law and law-enforcinginstitutions are too strong and powerful for them to be neglected orunder-evaluated. Then there is a shift in that mafia violence. TheCorleones going to Sicilia, among other things to take part in thefirst operatic production of Michael's own son who is an opera tenor,violence catches them up and Sicilia becomes the theatre of what theycan't do in the US any more. And once again Michael goes through and iswell protected by the men of his nephew who he has just appointed hissuccessor, and also by chance. The final gun directed at him cannot beprevented from firing, though the assassin will be shot back on thespot by the new Don Corleone, but Michael is once again lucky and thebullet does not reach him. For more details rush to the DVD. Thus thethird part ends in drama, even melodrama. But it is definitely clearerthan the second that is too long and too complex and entangled.

Coppola's vision never comes into focus, which is a shame, because there is a lot to resolve from the first two movies.Its like it tries to be a brand new movie on its own, rather than the culmination of the events and relationships in I and II. Only the characters and some history of the previous films seems applicable.Likely, Coppola was trapped by trying to do too much - trying to conclude the Godfather narrative; having Michael redeem himself while still protecting his family; trying to produce a unique film on its own, etc. The power of movies I and II is their clear and rich narratives. The story-telling is like a Greek classic; everything resolving itself so finally and tellingly: ""the son can do nothing except what he sees the father doing.""Film II was the interesting beginning of Vito, (who seemingly never made a mistake,) and the unraveling of Michael, (who, in trying to legitimize the family's ""business,"" involves himself to a much more final degree; a place where Vito would never have gone.) In that, Michael, who responded to the violent threat against his father by using violence, is a greater villain than his father, who appeared very comfortable with violence; handling everything like the Sicilian he was.Coppola was narrating the course of this country through these movies, and to a certain extent, he succeeded. However, as this country has historically become more fragmented and less focused over the last 100 years, perhaps this is why III fares so badly. There is definitely no clear resolution with the Corleone family at the end of this movie.Pacino is very ""un-Michael"" in this movie, in that he emotes too much, and is far more expressive and physical than he was in the first two movies. Historically, Michael's character is detached, brooding, and very intense. These are his hallmarks, and is why he is so believable in the first two movies. Where did this Michael go? Answer: there is simply too much time passed between the first two movies and this one to believably extend this man.Where was Bobby Duval? Didn't anyone think he was a vital part of the ""family?"" They had to write him off? Ah, there was a salary dispute and Duval refused to reprise Hagen. (Accordingly to the wiki, the plot line was supposed to revolve around him taking over the family business: a much more interesting story than the one we got.)Without Hagen, the ""family"" is a very small fraction of what it was. In fact, we see precious little interaction between Michael and his two children; the ""family"" he sold his soul to protect. (Didn't we see more warmth and involvement from Vito?) So who cares about what happens to Sophia? Michael certainly didn't.Coppola's daughter is not strong in this role. There is very little interesting about her, and she serves only as a plot device. Vintage Coppola would have done this better. As it was, he got to cast his fully grown daughter as a principle in this movie. Great for him.Talia Shire is the only one whose character development made any sense. At least she had some through-line from the previous two, and has become a thoroughly ""family"" woman in every sense. She is corrupt and an advocate of violence; a complete turn-around from her original. It made sense - otherwise, she would have over-dosed on pills years ago.Diane Keaton served no purpose in this movie except to simply be there. Her words to Michael mean nothing. She is there at the end, (why?) to see him get his comeuppance. Aside from that, she served her purpose by the end of II. They couldn't get Duval, so they bring back Keaton. Another wasted character.Michael has this big scene at the coffin of Don Tommasino, (WHO? Exactly.) Apparently this guy was Vito Corleone the second, because the words Michael tells to him are exactly what he would be telling his father, had he lived 20 more years, (which conceivably, could have happened, as Vito is in his late 50's when he dies in part I.) Michael has this long heart-to-heart with a stiff that we know, (and care,) nothing about. Not very scintillating plot progression, here.Seems to me Puzo let Coppola form most of this story himself, which is not a good thing for him to do, simply because he is too creative and unstructured. His best work comes from adapting a story-line that already exists; like I and II, and Apocalypse Now. When he's given full tiller, he isn't able to restrict his highly creative faculties. (Plus, the lack of the Hagen resolution left them with a fraction of the story-line this should/could have had. Blame Paramount for this, folks. It was their budgetary call.)Andy Garcia - nice guy, good actor. Tried to make him an amalgamation of Sonny, Fredo, and Michael.  Failed miserably. At least at the end of film I, we understand the accension of Michael to his father's throne. With Garcia, we neither know nor care. His is the resolving plot device to make this the transfer and continuation of the Corleone dynasty. Very predictable and very ho-hum.Honestly, the lack of the Hagen/Michael resolution has made this entire story one of mediocrity and graphic violence. We simply do not know or care enough about these people to bring the franchise to a close. Okay. Michael is devastated that his daughter is killed. He screams and screams and screams and screams. Is that really Michael from I and II? Is THIS truly Michael's inner soul? (The one we didn't see in I and II?) I don't think so. Michael, if true to form, should have simply died on the spot from catharsis, (such is his love and devotion to his family!) As it closes, he actually does this years later as an old man sitting on a chair, companioned by a dog. With no ""family"" around to care.Conclusion: your entire life was a waste, Michael Corleone. You get zero redemption at any point because. . .  because. . . (because Paramount didn't want to pay Bobby Duval what they were paying Al Pacino!) That's about it. After the end of I, we were amazed by the reversal of fortune for Michael. After II, we were in wonderment about the toll taken by the surrounding events. After III? We simply don't care.A very poor resolution to a monumental film franchise. One hardly recognizes the power and majesty ensconced in the earlier films. Almost like a boffo take-off on the original.

298716,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,6302158176,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 4]","Sixteen long years after the release of ""The Godfather Part 2"", Paramount Pictures along with writer and director Francis Ford Coppola, and co-writer Mario Puzo, delivered to audiences the final chapter in one of the greatest cinematic sagas ever committed to film.""The Godfather Part 3"" finds Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) closer than ever to realizing his dream of transitioning his family into strictly legitimate business dealings. As a part of improving the public's image of both he and his family, Michael is reaching out to the Catholic Church through the charitable donation of millions of his own dollars. Just as Michael has finally found a viable way out of the life of crime that he's known for so many years, a rival gangster seeks to move in on the impending power vacuum Michael's departure will undoubtedly leave behind. Yet this obvious power play may not come without its fair share of bloodshed. Enter Michael's nephew Vincent (Andy Garcia), an up-and-coming mafia hood who wants nothing more than to protect his beloved uncle and preserve the legacy of the Corleone family for years to come.For some reason, that I cannot wrap my head around, ""The Godfather Part 3"" is almost universally panned as being the weakest entry in the trilogy. Personally, I can't figure out what the problem is with this movie that causes so many people to essentially loathe watching it. For me, no matter how many times I watch the film, and do my best to find some fault in it, I still walk away enjoying it as much as I did its two predecessors. Plus, I can't seem to find any glaring problems with the film. Perhaps audiences just don't respond well to the redemptive message inherent within the story, maybe there are just not enough darker elements, such as murder, betrayal, sadness, and despair to satisfy their typical mafia fix. Whatever the case may be, I doubt I will ever understand why this installment is so maligned by most viewers, but I digress.Now, let's talk about what I feel is the main focus of this final chapter in ""The Godfather saga"". I believe the purpose of this third film is two-fold; first, it is an appropriate vehicle with which Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo nicely tie up any loose ends still left over from the initial two installments, while introducing us to a fascinating final act for the Corleone family. Second, ""The Godfather Part 3"" can almost be viewed as a thank you to the fans on behalf of the entire cast and crew of the series. What I mean by that is, after ""The Godfather Part 2"" there was a 16 year gap between films, hinting that perhaps the Corleone family's story was finished, but by returning to the series for one more film the cast and crew reward the audience for their loyalty (and patience) to the franchise. Not to mention the film brings the entire story of Michael Corleone full circle in a very powerful, yet bittersweet sort of way.Speaking of Michael's character arc within this grand trilogy, there is a definite metamorphosis that Michael goes through over the course of his journey. In ""The Godfather"", Michael is an idealistic young man, untainted by the dark world that his father and brothers belong to; however, over the course of that film certain events lead to Michael's eventual baptism by fire into the underworld. Then we come to ""The Godfather Part 2"", where the darkness that had once consumed his father and brothers has now consumed Michael completely, and the results of his decisions do not come without a cost. Finally, we arrive at ""The Godfather Part 3"" and the path he has chosen has resulted in so much death, despair, and loneliness that Michael finally is beginning to realize that perhaps the only way to find some measure of peace is to seek redemption for the sins of his past.On a side note, as a fan of the entire series, I appreciate that this film's story includes numerous nods and/or mentions to events that occurred in the previous films in the trilogy. When a film franchise references events within its own history, I find that to be an added bonus, and shows that those involved in the films take great pride in their work, and strive to further enrich the audience's experience while watching them.From an acting standpoint, this series continues to be one of the greatest examples of brilliant acting one could ever hope to witness. For Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, I'm surprised that they were still able to find new ground to cover with their respective characters. Al's performance as Michael is more reserved and at times weary, yet still as emotionally charged as ever. Diane Keaton brings to Kay a quiet strength and an indomitable will power that at times rivals even that of Michael's, a trait no doubt developed over the course of many years of dealing in his world. Also returning for a third go-round is actress Talia Shire (""Rocky"" franchise) as Michael's older sister, Connie. Finally, Talia is given a character arc that has much more substance to it than what she previously had been given, no doubt a rewarding turn of events for her as an actress. Talia's arc was much different from that of the previous two films; no longer a victim of any kind, Connie is much more in charge, and accepting of the world that had consumed her entire family for the last two generations.Newcomers to the franchise include the considerable talents of Andy Garcia, Bridget Fonda, Eli Wallach, and Joe Mantegna. Each of the new cast members brought a sense of newness to the film, something that each of these three films has surprisingly managed to do with every release. Andy Garcia was the standout performance for me out of the new members of the cast. His energetic performance harkened back to James Caan's volatile character of Sonny from the original film, a character void that had never truly been filled by any other member of the cast within the series.One thing is for certain after watching not only ""The Godfather Part 3"", but the entire trilogy, is that no matter how glamorized the life of the mafia may appear to be (as shown by most movies dealing with the subject), this kind of lifestyle is not worth all the heartache, sadness, and death that surrounds everyone involved. It's true that even ""The Godfather"" trilogy glamorized this life to an extent, but at the same time, each of the films took some time within their respective stories to reveal the consequences of the dark choices of life and death that these people make throughout their lives.""The Godfather Part 3"" is yet another triumphant piece of American cinema, expertly crafted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, serving as the perfect final chapter in one of the most beloved film sagas of all time.""The Godfather Part 3"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,The Final Act in One of the

Puzo was a real story teller. The dialogue was brilliant and unlike any movies before them.  I never tire of watching them.It doesn't appear that Puzo contributed much to the screenplay. Neither our love of the characters nor the amazing acting talent can overcome the lack of a consistent story line, the painful near reconciliation of Michael and Kay or the retread feel of the movie. Sophie Coppola is no actress, but Talia Shire as Connie was terrible. It was not really Shire's fault: Coppola takes the flighty, feminine Connie from Godfather I and turns her into an unconvincing, interfering ""Godmother"" -- ordering killings, etc. Al Pacino, as has been the case in the latter part of his career, overacted the part of Michael and essentially changed Michael from a serious, unsmiling, calculating, cold-blooded gangster/killer to an outgoing, expressive, gregarious, repentant philanthropist.

298722,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6302158176,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[1, 4]","Francis Ford Coppola concludes his cinematic biography and film study of the Will to Power of the fictional Corleone Crime Family in THE GODFATHER, PART III (1990). Completed fifteen years after THE GODFATHER, PART II and seventeen years after the original film, this movie is generally considered an unworthy successor to two of the greatest films ever created. In truth, THE GODFATHER, PART III is a far better film than is generally recognized. But as a high quality ""average""  film, it badly pales in comparison to the brilliant 'Part I' and virtually perfect PART II.In the original, Coppola presented us, by chance, with a mythos of the Father In Age and the Son In Youth. In PART II, he consciously created a study of the Father In Youth and the Son In Middle Age. By this logic, PART III should have been a story of the Father In Middlescence and the Son In Age. But it is not.Surprisingly, Coppola never seemed to envision the films as such a portrait. Although Coppola does give us the Son In Age in THE GODFATHER, PART III, rather than completing his beautiful tryptych portrait of Vito and Michael as Father And Son, he revisits a theme of the first film, that of The Prodigal Son. By treading the same ground in THE GODFATHER, PART III, he seriously weakens this film.The Prodigal Son is Vincent Mancini, Michael's uncertain heir-apparent and nephew, the illegitimate son of his deceased brother Sonny Corleone and his sister Connie's (Talia Shire) bridesmaid, Lucy. Vincent is played by Andy Garcia in the only Oscar-caliber performance of his less-than-stellar career. Although initially considered by all to be ""The Next Pacino"" Garcia is a charter member of The Flat Affect School of Acting typified by Kevin Costner and Viggo Mortensen, and over the years has generally proved to be as engaging onscreen as watching a block of wood. Far worse is Sofia Coppola, the Director's daughter and Talia Shire's niece, whose awful performance as Mary Corleone is legendary.Sensing but never really understanding the central flaw in this film, Coppola tries to close the lacuna with overly-contrived subplots about a rival Don's depredations against the Corleone Family and an international conspiracy to assassinate Pope John Paul I. As a result, THE GODFATHER III occasionally degenerates into a platform for several gratuitously violent scenes, and, at times, takes on the ""B"" air of a spy thriller.The grand performance of this film is Al Pacino's as the aging Don Michael, who, after a bloodstained lifetime of crass manipulation and loss, is spiritually working toward his own redemption. Although he tries valiantly to legitimize the Corleone Family and distance himself from the sins of his past, the shackles of his life's work are not so easily loosed. In Michael, Pacino gives us a tragic portrayal of a man consumed by his own inner demons who is desperately seeking the one spark of light in his innermost being. Unlike Don Vito however, who lived and died knowing himself, Don Michael can never receive dispensation, and Lear-like, must content himself only with acts of contrition.Coppola has returned time and again to THE GODFATHER trilogy re-editing and reworking it. Like Don Michael, he wishes to expiate his shortcomings, one of which is the blind spot that obscured this potentially great film.",3,"""Just when I'm out, they pull me back in...""",1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,3324,"['Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'cinematic', 'biography', 'film', 'study', 'Will', 'Power', 'fictional', 'Corleone', 'Crime', 'Family', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'III', '1990', 'Completed', 'fifteen', 'years', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'II', 'seventeen', 'years', 'original', 'film', 'movie', 'generally', 'considered', 'unworthy', 'successor', 'two', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'created', 'truth', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'III', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'generally', 'recognized', 'high', 'quality', 'average', 'film', 'badly', 'comparison', 'brilliant', 'virtually', 'perfect', 'PART', 'II.In', 'original', 'Coppola', 'presented', 'chance', 'mythos', 'Father', 'Age', 'Son', 'Youth', 'PART', 'II', 'consciously', 'created', 'study', 'Father', 'Youth', 'Son', 'Middle', 'Age', 'logic', 'PART', 'III', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'Father', 'Middlescence', 'Son', 'Age', 'not.Surprisingly', 'Coppola', 'never', 'seemed', 'envision', 'films', 'such', 'portrait', 'Coppola', 'give', 'Son', 'Age', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'III', 'rather', 'completing', 'beautiful', 'tryptych', 'portrait', 'Vito', 'Michael', 'Father', 'Son', 'theme', 'first', 'film', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'treading', 'same', 'ground', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'III', 'seriously', 'film.The', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'Vincent', 'Mancini', 'Michael', 'uncertain', 'heir-apparent', 'nephew', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'deceased', 'brother', 'Sonny', 'Corleone', 'sister', 'Connie', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'bridesmaid', 'Lucy', 'Vincent', 'played', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'only', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'less-than-stellar', 'career', 'initially', 'considered', 'be', 'Next', 'Pacino', 'Garcia', 'charter', 'member', 'Flat', 'Affect', 'School', 'Acting', 'typified', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'years', 'generally', 'proved', 'be', 'engaging', 'onscreen', 'watching', 'block', 'wood', 'Far', 'worse', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Director', 'daughter', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'niece', 'awful', 'performance', 'Mary', 'Corleone', 'legendary.Sensing', 'never', 'really', 'understanding', 'central', 'flaw', 'film', 'Coppola', 'close', 'lacuna', 'overly-contrived', 'subplots', 'rival', 'Don', 'depredations', 'Corleone', 'Family', 'international', 'conspiracy', 'assassinate', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'result', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'III', 'occasionally', 'platform', 'several', 'gratuitously', 'violent', 'scenes', 'times', 'B', 'air', 'spy', 'thriller.The', 'grand', 'performance', 'film', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'aging', 'Don', 'Michael', 'who', 'bloodstained', 'lifetime', 'crass', 'manipulation', 'loss', 'spiritually', 'working', 'own', 'redemption', 'valiantly', 'legitimize', 'Corleone', 'Family', 'distance', 'sins', 'past', 'shackles', 'life', 'work', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'loosed', 'Michael', 'Pacino', 'tragic', 'portrayal', 'man', 'consumed', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'who', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'one', 'spark', 'light', 'innermost', 'being', 'Don', 'Vito', 'however', 'who', 'lived', 'died', 'knowing', 'Don', 'Michael', 'can', 'never', 'receive', 'dispensation', 'Lear-like', 'must', 'content', 'only', 'acts', 'contrition.Coppola', 'returned', 'time', 'again', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'trilogy', 're-editing', 'reworking', 'Don', 'Michael', 'expiate', 'shortcomings', 'one', 'blind', 'spot', 'obscured', 'potentially', 'great', 'film']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

I think the screenwriters hoped that storyline in the book had been forgotten because one of the basic premises of the film directly conflicts from that in the book.  This final episode introduces a new character, Vincent Mancini,  who is supposed to be the son of Sonny and his girlfriend Lucy.  However, the book makes it very very clear that she certainly never had a child with Sonny.  This might be good for the plot, but it disputes the book.Anyway, most of the original cast is still there.  Al Pacino is now the Godfather, Diane Keaton is his ex-wife and Talia Shire is his sister.  Sofia Coppola, who is the daughter of the director, Francis Ford Coppola, is cast as the Godfather's daughter.  And now there is a new and important character introduced.  This is supposedly Sonny's son, played by Andy Garcia.  He sure is good looking and tough and a Godfather-in-the-making.  Soon, he is challenging the Godfather and is also in a romance with the Godfather's daughter.The Godfather has a lot of money by now but the amounts that are thrown around are just too humongous to be believed, like 100 million dollars to the church and as much as 50 million to each of his gangster friends in the hope of forming a coalition.  There is also a scene where a helicopter breaks through the tarp used as  the roof of an Atlantic City Casino with machine guns shooting bullets at everyone in attendance.  This is just too much to be believed.That said, there still great scenes and some fine acting.  I particularly liked the scene between the Godfather and his former wife as they attend their son's operatic debut performance in Sicily of Cavalleria Rusticana.  Actually, all the scenes set in Sicily are well done and I was impressed with its beauty.With all its faults, however, this film is a good concluding chapter of the Godfather film saga and I enjoyed all of it.",4,Good film but some aspects too much to be believed,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,2012,"['third', 'final', 'film', 'depicting', 'Corleone', 'family', 'Godfather', 'fame', 'was', 'produced', '1990', 'sixteen', 'years', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'think', 'screenwriters', 'hoped', 'storyline', 'book', 'had', 'been', 'forgotten', 'one', 'basic', 'premises', 'film', 'directly', 'book', 'final', 'episode', 'new', 'character', 'Vincent', 'Mancini', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'son', 'Sonny', 'girlfriend', 'Lucy', 'However', 'book', 'very', 'very', 'clear', 'certainly', 'never', 'had', 'child', 'Sonny', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'plot', 'book.Anyway', 'most', 'original', 'cast', 'still', 'there', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'now', 'Godfather', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'ex-wife', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'sister', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'who', 'daughter', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'cast', 'Godfather', 'daughter', 'now', 'new', 'important', 'character', 'introduced', 'supposedly', 'Sonny', 'son', 'played', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'sure', 'good', 'looking', 'tough', 'Godfather-in-the-making', 'Soon', 'challenging', 'Godfather', 'also', 'romance', 'Godfather', 'daughter.The', 'Godfather', 'lot', 'money', 'now', 'amounts', 'are', 'thrown', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'humongous', 'be', 'believed', '100', 'million', 'dollars', 'church', 'as', 'much', '50', 'million', 'gangster', 'friends', 'hope', 'forming', 'coalition', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'helicopter', 'breaks', 'tarp', 'used', 'roof', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Casino', 'machine', 'guns', 'shooting', 'bullets', 'everyone', 'attendance', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'believed.That', 'said', 'still', 'great', 'scenes', 'fine', 'acting', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scene', 'Godfather', 'former', 'wife', 'attend', 'son', 'operatic', 'debut', 'performance', 'Sicily', 'Cavalleria', 'Rusticana', 'Actually', 'scenes', 'set', 'Sicily', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'impressed', 'beauty.With', 'faults', 'however', 'film', 'good', 'concluding', 'chapter', 'Godfather', 'film', 'saga', 'enjoyed']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

298731,A36EW68H08UOCS,6302158176,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 4]","Some reviews can't blast this film enough:""There's no sugarcoating the magnitude of the cinematic disaster that ""Part III"" represents.""""Let's all hope that there will be no Part IV.""I think a bandwagon of bashing gathered momentum, and for those who like to look for chinks in the armor, this film seemed the opportunity to throw stones.  I say wait and see: in years to come history will mark part III as a fitting conclusion to the Corleone saga.  No, it is not a masterpiece of the stature of the first two Coppola classics, but dear friends, I'd argue neither were ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"" or ""Once Upon a Time in America"", and although those mafia-themed films are all highly acclaimed, none of them reach the heights of the first two Godfather films, and that shouldn't be held against them.  Neither should it be held against GF III.Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo returned to the characters they know better than anyone, and fashioned a tale that dovetails believably into the Corleone history of the first two films.Al Pacino returns as Don Michael Corleone.  Michael has the strength and cunning of his father, Vito, and an almost superhuman ability to foresee future events.  But where the great Vito Corleone also had a keen devotion to family and compassion for his fellow man, Michael has a cold ruthlessness that allows him to order the murder of family members.Michael is a tragic character.  In the opening of the first film (and we are told in Puzo's original novel) Michael is something of a disappointment to his father and family exactly because he does not want to join the family business.  He enlists in the Marines after Pearl Harbor, even though his father has pulled strings to keep him out of the military.  He's planning a career as a teacher, married to his college sweetheart, but even the enemies of the family know that Michael is an outsider in the family business.The attempted murder of his father pulls Michael quickly into the inner circle.  Circumstances outside his control compel him to become exactly the person he does not want to be.In an early scene in part II wife Kay (wonderfully played by Diane Keaton in all the films) reminds Michael that seven years earlier he had promised her that the family would be ""completely legitimate"" within five years.Part III opens with Michael receiving a high Catholic honor, bestowed on behalf of the Pope himself.  The Church is in trouble. (Based on the real-life papal banking scandal of the early `80s.) Michael is willing to give Archbishop Gilday, the Vatican banker, 600 million in exchange for control of Immobiliare, the largest real estate and construction company in Italy.  When the Archbishop tells Michael that it will be difficult to get the Vatican to approve this deal, Michael says that the family has completely given up all illegitimate businesses. This storyline drives the rest of the film.The Corleones have sold their Vegas hotels and casinos and the other families, used to wetting their beaks in the Corleone fountain, feel left behind as Michael tries to move his family completely away from organized crime.Talia Shire returns again as Michael's sister, Connie, and her role is amplified as counselor as well.  Women are marginalized and completely outside the family business in the earlier films.  Connie is also a mentor and proponent for the next up-and-coming Corleone, Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent, played with intelligence and menace by Andy Garcia in perhaps his first major screen role.  (Coppola seems to have a particular genius for finding and using acting giants before they are well known.  Pacino, Keaton, Robert Deniro, Robert Duvall and John Cazale were all relatively unknown before appearing in the first films.)Much has been made of daughter Sofia Coppola playing Michael's daughter Mary.  The truth is, she has the look, but the romance between Mary and Vincent seems more awkward than passionate, and since Vincent is smart and ambitious, it doesn't make much sense that he would pursue Mary for any reason other than passion since Michael discourages their pairing.  Naysayers can't help but mention that Winona Ryder dropped out of this part at the last minute. (To make Edward Scissorhands.) I can't help but be reminded of the critical thrashing Angelica Huston took for playing the lead in an early film of her famous father, prior to an acting career that resulted in an Academy Award.  Hopefully Ms. Coppola takes some satisfaction that her career progressed to Oscar nominations as a director herself.  In short - she is not so bad that she ruins this film.Robert Duvall is missed as Tom Hagen, and George Harrison is bland as new family attorney B.J. Harrison.The business subplot runs parallel with the plot of the torment of Michael.  As he grows older, and makes more attempts to get out of crime, he nonetheless sees death and tragedy in his wake.  He wants to make amends.  He wants to leave a legacy for his children and to reconcile with Kay, and some of the strongest scenes in the film are when he seems to be succeeding, if only a little.  At one point he consults a priest he thinks will have insight into the Immobiliare deal.  This wise priest feels that Michael has a need for confession.  Startled, Michael admits he hasn't confessed in thirty years.  The priest coaxes Michael because ""it's never too late"", and the work of the two actors in this scene is exceptional.There is a format to the three films: all begin with a large ensemble celebratory scene which includes a few private moments to set the story in motion.  All end with a montage of murder as Corleone enemies are eliminated.  There is a style and elegance and richness in The Godfather films that exists in this one as well.The first two movies won ""Best Picture"".  The last of ""The Lord of the Rings"" films did the same, but I don't recall vitriol being spread on the LOTR films that did not.  The Godfather part III should be enjoyed not for what it is not, but for what it is.",4,Only suffers in comparison to the first two films,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,6006,"['reviews', 'ca', ""n't"",

The Godfather III is so close to good and bad that it can go either way. Coppola should be commended for putting together a film with all the original characters and the same look as the first two flawless films. Coppola should have paid Duvall whatever he wanted to be in the film as he is sorely missed here. Coppola's daughter while not great in this film isn't the actor who bothered me the most. I found Pacino to run hot and cold here, in some scenes he is very good(his confession for his past sins)and in others I found him to be a completely different character(giving the fatherly advise to Vincent and yelling a lot). I also found Andy Garcia to be a bit fake although he did add life to a very slow and boring film. This was probably due to Coppola not giving him enough to do.Some good points are the wedding with it's watered down version of the original's wedding scene, which sadly is the case in real life. I am Italian American and I remember those weddings with the old timers singing and entertaining everyone. It was a grand time with Nana and Pop Pop at the microphone and in this film when we see Connie trying to revive the old time fun again, it reminded me of a sad reality of these events nowadays. I also liked that Michael couldn't bare what he had done to his brother Fredo, but Pacino is like a raving madman in this film, what happened to cold and quite Michael? It just doesn't add up for me and I found his performance distracting at times.Connie(Shire)is at her best here, I think she could have been a scarier Don than Pacino in the film! I also thought Diane Keaton was very good and true to her character. The plot is interesting, but it seems to take a long time getting where it wants to go and that is something I never felt about the first two films. In the first two films I wanted them to go on and on and with this one I just couldn't wait for it to end! ....Too bad, it's not a total loss, but it sure ain't what it ""shoulda""  ""woulda"" ""coulda ""been.The new Blu Ray looks very good and looks obviously cleaner than the first two films. Coppola kept the tinting the same for this film, so they all look very much alike and I hope some day(soon)they will release the director's cut with all three films woven together as one. It's the best version IMHO and it deserves a DVD and Blu Ray release.",3,DISAPPOINTING!....

I would first like to mention this though, and that is to stop bashing Sofia Coppola.  It's not as if Diane Keaton was at first a good choice in the first film (sometimes her character drove me nuts, but this changed by Part II).  While, yes there is one scene in particular that was not one of Sofia's best (and if you listen to the commentary, not really a fault of hers), I otherwise fell in love with her character when watching this film.  I'm about to mention a spoiler here, so if you haven't watched this, don't read this sentence.  When her character is killed at the end of the film, I really felt the shock and pain that Michael had for the death of his daughter.  I literally screamed at the screen for her to get out of the way when the gunman was getting prepared.  This scene contained Al Garcia's flaw, because I wasn't convinced when he screamed ""No!"" after he saw that she was shot.  Otherwise, I thought his performance was just perfect, displaying how he carried Sonny's tough attitude.  I was so happy to see that Gordon Willis remained the photographer, though I wouldn't see why Francis would choose anyone else.  Carmine Coppola was able to add in some wonderful, lovely original music, while also remaining very faithful to Nino Rota's haunting score (having worked on the first two films, in particular, Godfather Part II).  I wish it was more represented on the soundtrack.  In fact, we even have the treat of seeing him conduct the orchestra in the beginning party sequence.  I loved Al Pacino's different approach to Michael, because now we see that he wants to make himself move more in a legitimate direction (unlike what he told Kay in the first film), and this he even states, which causes him to be pulled back into a non-legitimate state again.  We see him getting tired of having men killed, and he basically is less than the monster that he had become in Part II.  While I am also disappointed that Robert Duvall did not reprise his role, I thought that George Hamilton was a fine replacement, though he did seem to not care to hear about Tom Hagen when Tom's son (played by the wonderful John Savage), was leaving for Rome.  The use of the opera I thought was a magnificent idea from Coppola and Puzo, and helped the film out in a very dramatic and theatrical way (not to mention its operatic tendencies).  The moment where Vincent reacts to the opera's own version of someone's ear being bitten I thought was actually pretty humorous.  I don't know if this was intentional, but you have to want to laugh at it.  And it was wonderful to finally see Talia Shire's character expanded upon, so that we can see Shire's extraordinary acting as this character to its fullest, and rather sexy in her delivery.  Yes, the film is definitely unique in its own way, and touches upon a rather heavy subject too, which made it all the more intense.  While it may have been made for money, I'm still glad it was made.  I thought that Francis made a daring choice making another movie that was a continuation of a story that ended (or in this case, stopped) 16 years ago, and the result was nothing short of amazing, surprising, and satisfying.",5,Unique in its own special way,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,3291,"['personally', 'really', 'did', 'love', 'Godfather', 'film', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'number', 'II', 'said', 'would', 'first', 'like', 'mention', 'though', 'stop', 'bashing', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'not', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'was', 'first', 'good', 'choice', 'first', 'film', 'sometimes', 'character', 'drove', 'nuts', 'changed', 'Part', 'II', 'yes', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'Sofia', 'best', 'listen', 'commentary', 'not', 'really', 'fault', 'hers', 'otherwise', 'fell', 'love', 'character', 'when', 'watching', 'film', ""'m"", 'mention', 'spoiler', 'here', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'sentence', 'When', 'character', 'killed', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'felt', 'shock', 'pain', 'Michael', 'had', 'death', 'daughter', 'literally', 'screamed', 'screen', 'get', 'way', 'when', 'gunman', 'was', 'getting', 'prepared', 'scene', 'contained', 'Al', 'Garcia', 'flaw', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'when', 'screamed', 'No', 'saw', 'was', 'shot', 'Otherwise', 'thought', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'displaying', 'how', 'carried', 'Sonny', 'tough', 'attitude', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'Gordon', 'Willis', 'remained', 'photographer', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'Francis', 'would', 'choose', 'anyone', 'else', 'Carmine', 'Coppola', 'was', 'able', 'add', 'wonderful', 'lovely', 'original', 'music', 'also', 'remaining', 'very', 'faithful', 'Nino', 'Rota', 'haunting', 'score', 'having', 'worked', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'particular', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'represented', 'soundtrack', 'fact', 'even', 'have', 'treat', 'seeing', 'conduct', 'orchestra', 'beginning', 'party', 'sequence', 'loved', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'different', 'approach', 'Michael', 'because', 'now', 'see', 'make', 'move', 'more', 'legitimate', 'direction', 'what', 'told', 'Kay', 'first', 'film', 'even', 'states', 'be', 'pulled', 'back', 'non-legitimate', 'state', 'again', 'see', 'getting', 'tired', 'having', 'men', 'killed', 'basically', 'less', 'monster', 'had', 'become', 'Part', 'II', 'am', 'also', 'disappointed', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'did', 'not', 'reprise', 'role', 'thought', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'fine', 'replacement', 'did', 'seem', 'not', 'care', 'hear', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'when', 'Tom', 'son', 'played', 'wonderful', 'John', 'Savage', 'was', 'leaving', 'Rome', 'use', 'opera', 'thought', 'was', 'magnificent', 'idea', 'Coppola', 'Puzo', 'helped', 'film', 'out', 'very', 'dramatic', 'theatrical', 'way', 'not', 'mention', 'operatic', 'tendencies', 'moment', 'where', 'Vincent', 'opera', 'own', 'version', 'someone', 'ear', 'being', 'bitten', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'humorous', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'intentional', 'have', 'want', 'laugh', 'was', 'wonderful', 'finally', 'see', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'character', 'expanded', 'upon', 'can', 'see', 'Shire', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'character', 'fullest', 'rather', 'sexy', 'delivery', 'Yes', 'film', 'definitely', 'unique', 'own', 'way', 'touches', 'rather', 'heavy', 'subject', 'too', 'made', 'more', 'intense', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'money', ""'m"", 'still', 'glad', 'was', 'made', 'thought', 'Francis', 'made', 'daring', 'choice', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'continuation', 'story', 'ended', 'case', 'stopped', '16', 'years', 'ago', 'result', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'surprising', 'satisfying']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

Of course coming back to a loved story after so many years is not an easy thing. The movie isn't bad by any means. Just the religious and cult like following the first two Godfather has, it's hard to live up to.Three things that I thought took away from the quality of the film:1. Sofia Coppola: she was not good in this movie at all. At times she looked bored, most of the time she looked confused. I believe Francis Ford Coppola, being her father didn't push her enough to the performance the movie deserved from such an important character. Winona Ryder was said to been a contender for this role.2. Robert Duvall: One of the Best actors from the original cast was left out from this film because of money. He is quoted recently as saying, ""I said I would work easily if they paid Pacino twice what they paid me, that's fine. But not three or four times, which is what they did,"" recalls Ducal. His absence and the addition of Sofia was a smack in the face of diehard fans.3. Andy Garcia: Don't get me wrong, he's a good actor but he acted like all he did was research on mob guys, I didn't get the impression that he was ever a tough guy in real life. Someone like Johnny Depp would have killed in this role.There are alot of really good reviews on the movies so I won't write anything long but these three things took away from the quality of the movie for me.

It wasn't her looks; She's not beautiful, but there's something inexplicably very sexy about her. Visually, I think she was actually almost perfect. But the sad fact is that she simply cannot act, and for a role as semi-pivotal as hers, that was severely wounding to the movie as a whole. You'll understand this in a minute once you start watching the film.Some of the other acting was king of blah as well, most notably Anthony, who came off fairly wooden himself, and George Hamilton, who's not a terrible actor but who, for some reason, looked like he wanted to be somewhere else in every scene. Even Talia Shire's performance wasn't completely up to par. Admittedly, she's a limited actress, but she's certainly done better than this.However, there were acting standouts: Pacino, of course, was his usual excellent self, with some nice (and unexpectedly fitting, where placed) comic touches here and there. Keaton was surprisingly effective. Eli Wallach was great, a real treat. And Andy Garcia, I thought, did an admirable and convincing job in his role. He truly did; watch the film and see. Also, Joe Montegna's character may have been based on John Gatti, but wasn't intended to be a carbon copy of him. Rather he played the role near-perfectly: a basic street hood who constantly attempts to, bit will never rise about a certain level of class.Yes, the film had some slow parts, but nothing unbearable, and yes, there were a few small plot holes, and yes, some subplots didn't seem to make sense. But as a whole it was, as the other 2, magnificently photographed and, naturally, well-directed. Yes, it would have been nice to have seen Robert Duvall in it, but his absence didn't ruin the film in any way, shape or form. And the interweaving of some real history was a nice touch as well. There were quite a few very well-done scenes overall.If you love the Godfather saga, you need this in your collection. Will you watch it as often as the other two? Probably not. But you will watch it more than once.

298747,A34PUCLNFN62D3,6302158176,Paco Caldern,"[30, 37]","The first time I saw it, I felt disappointed. Several viewings later, I thought it wasn't so bad -not as good as the first two, but not bad. Last night I saw the trilogy non-stop, and yes, it is THAT bad. Here's what's wrong with it:1.- Tom Hagen. He's crucial and he's missing. There's no Godfather III without him. And if Paramount didn't want to pay Robert Duvall whatever he wanted to reprise his role, they should quit show business altogether. Instead we get George Hamilton! What were they thinking, the penny-pincher idiots!2.- Michael Corleone. Not the same guy. Sure, Al Pacino plays him, but unfortunately, he forgot everything about the character. Michael Corelone doesn't ""love public speech""; he's a soft spoken, cold blooded, silent maniac who feels a fish out of water at weddings, first communions, baptisms, New Year's Eve, anything except funerals. A guy that seldom talks and never reveals his emotions. Here, he's a gregarious and bombastic party guy who yells all the time, talks all the time, curses, dances, mingles, counsels all the time. He's more Tony Montana than Michael Corleone. Not the same guy, I tell you. The hairdo doesn't help, either.3.- Mary Corleone. Too ugly. Sorry; no offense, but that's it. Her character is a princess; it deserved a knockout beauty. Or... the part should have been changed to an ugly duckling in love with her handsome relative, a S.O.B. who uses her to climb to the top while fooling around on the side. But such as it is, both the part and the actress are simply not believable. And Ms Coppola can't act, by the way. I'm glad she turned out to be a magnificent filmmaker.4.- Vincent Corleone. Too remote. Sonny's bastard boy. Mmmmmm, I dunno...too many heirs in front of him in line of succession. What happened to them? Coppola doesn't mention. Andy Garcia makes a terrific Corleone, but his part seems implausible. The obvious role was for him to play Connie's boy, Carlo Rizzi Jr, who happened to be Michael's first godson! Then everything falls into place: Carlo hates his godfather for having wacked his dad; Michael has a weak spot for him for the same reason, Mary has a fatal crush on her weasel cousin, he gets far too ambitious... see what I mean?5.-Don Altobello. Altowho? Where was him in the previous films? If he was Connie's Godfather, why wasn't he at the wedding? And how come he knows Don Luchese? And who is Don Luchese? As for the actor, Eli Wallach plays the part with gusto; a coniving Sicillian Tuco. I loved it!6.- The Vatican plot. Too murky, too preposterous. Coppola wanted to exploit the Banco Ambrosiano affair? Fine with me. Pope John Paul I strange and sudden death? Fine with me. Wanted to say that the Church is a bigger, meaner mafia than the mob itself? No problemo. But the Immobiliare thing gets far too confused, and one senses Coppola doesn't know where he's going or wants to. For such grand statements, he should have refined his story to perfection. By the way, both Pope Paul VI and John Paul I died in 1978, not 1979. Holy Blooper!So there you have it. A movie made merely for the money, by people who have grown to hate the previous two. Not a good start by any standard. I heard Coppola was so fed up with the Corleones, he wanted to make ""Abbott & Costello meet the Godfather"". Well, if his heart was really into it ...Harvey Korman was around, Buddy Hackett was around, Marlon Brando was around ...he should have made it instead!",2,WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,3441,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'Several', 'viewings', 'later', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', '-not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'not', 'bad', 'Last', 'night', 'saw', 'trilogy', 'non-stop', 'yes', 'bad', 'Here', 'what', 'wrong', 'it:1.-', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'crucial', 'missing', 'Godfather', 'III', 'Paramount', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'pay', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'wanted', 'reprise', 'role', 'should', 'quit', 'show', 'business', 'altogether', 'Instead', 'get', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'penny-pincher', 'idiots', '2.-', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'Not', 'same', 'guy', 'Sure', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'unfortunately', 'forgot', 'everything', 'character', 'Michael', 'Corelone', ""n't"", 'love', 'public', 'speech', 'soft', 'spoken', 'cold', 'blooded', 'silent', 'maniac', 'who', 'fish', 'water', 'weddings', 'first', 'communions', 'baptisms', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'anything', 'funerals', 'guy', 'talks', 'never', 'reveals', 'emotions', 'Here', 'gregarious', 'bombastic', 'party', 'guy', 'who', 'time', 'talks', 'time', 'curses', 'dances', 'mingles', 'counsels', 'time', 'more', 'Tony', 'Montana', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'Not', 'same', 'guy', 'tell', 'hairdo', ""n't"", 'help', 'either.3.-', 'Mary', 'Corleone', 'Too', 'ugly', 'Sorry', 'offense', 'character', 'princess', 'deserved', 'knockout', 'beauty', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'love', 'handsome', 'relative', 'S.O.B', 'who', 'climb', 'top', 'fooling', 'around', 'side', 'such', 'part', 'actress', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'Ms', 'Coppola', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', ""'m"", 'glad', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'magnificent', 'filmmaker.4.-', 'Vincent', 'Corleone', 'Too', 'remote', 'Sonny', 'bastard', 'boy', 'Mmmmmm', 'dunno', 'too', 'many', 'heirs', 'front', 'line', 'succession', 'What', 'happened', 'Coppola', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'terrific', 'Corleone', 'part', 'implausible', 'obvious', 'role', 'was', 'play', 'Connie', 'boy', 'Carlo', 'Rizzi', 'Jr', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'Michael', 'first', 'godson', 'Then', 'everything', 'place', 'Carlo', 'godfather', 'having', 'wacked', 'dad', 'Michael', 'weak', 'spot', 'same', 'reason', 'Mary', 'fatal', 'crush', 'weasel', 'cousin', 'far', 'too', 'ambitious', 'see', 'what', 'mean', '5.-Don', 'Altobello', 'Altowho', 'Where', 'was', 'previous', 'films', 'was', 'Connie', 'Godfather', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'wedding', 'how', 'come', 'Don', 'Luchese', 'who', 'Don', 'Luchese', 'actor', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'part', 'gusto', 'coniving', 'Sicillian', 'Tuco', 'loved', '6.-', 'Vatican', 'plot', 'Too', 'murky', 'too', 'preposterous', 'Coppola', 'wanted', 'exploit', 'Banco', 'Ambrosiano', 'affair', 'Fine', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'strange', 'sudden', 'death', 'Fine', 'Wanted', 'say', 'Church', 'bigger', 'meaner', 'mafia', 'mob', 'problemo', 'Immobiliare', 'thing', 'far', 'too', 'confused', 'one', 'senses', 'Coppola', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'going', 'such', 'grand', 'statements', 'should', 'have', 'refined', 'story', 'perfection', 'way', 'Pope', 'Paul', 'VI', 'John', 'Paul', 'died', '1978', 'not', '1979', 'Holy', 'Blooper', 'So', 'there', 'have', 'movie', 'made', 'merely', 'money', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'hate', 'previous', 'two', 'Not', 'good', 'start', 'standard', 'heard', 'Coppola', 'was', 'so', 'fed', 'up', 'Corleones', 'wanted', 'make', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Godfather', 'Well', 'heart', 'was', 'really', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'was', 'around', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'was', 'around', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'was', 'around', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'instead']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"
298748,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,6302158176,Patrick L. Randall,"[6, 8]","""The Godfather, Part III"" suffers tremendously when compared with its two legendary predecessors.  It simply lacks the originality and sweeping, epic scope of those originals.  That being said, it's not nearly as bad a movie as some critics and reviewers would have you believe.  There are definite weak moments and performances in the film, most notably that of Sofia Coppola playing Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) daughter, Mary.  Her performance lacks the depth and power necessary to carry this kind of material.  Her's is the work of a novice actress, which she was.  Her scenes are not unwatchable and she's not truly terrible, but she's also not very good and parts of her performance are uncomfortable to watch.  Still, it is nice to see most of the same cast back together again with Michael, Connie, Kay, Al Neri, and even Johnny Fontane.What gives ""...Part III"" its hook is the quest of Michael Corleone to clean himself of the family business and seek redemption for his past sins.  After watching him become one of the most menacing cinematic characters ever in the previous two films, it's intriguing and somewhat sad to watch him struggle to make things right with the people he has hurt as he sees his life reaching its twilight.  His legacy has been one of greed and violence and now he wishes it to be one of kindness and benevolence.  Of course, once you're in the family, it's nearly impossible to leave.  An assassination attempt on his life after he had settled all accounts (with money instead of violence) with his fellow mafioso types graphically illustrates that point, and leads to his famous quote, ""Just when I thought that I was out they pull me back in.""  His hot-headed nephew, Vincent Mancini (Sonny's ... son, played superbly by Andy Garcia), further inflames the situation with his incessant need for revenge on behalf of Michael (and an illicit affair with Mary).  Still, Michael hopes he can overcome this setback and move on with his desire for a crime-free life.  He seeks to make the Corleone business enterprise totally legitimate by purchasing the international conglomerate, Immobiliare (sp?), the construction and development arm of the Vatican.  He also seeks to sever his ties with the violent aspect of the business by transferring the title, and all its trappings, of 'Godfather' to Vincent.The true crux of the story involves Michael's business dealings with corrupt Vatican officials over this deal, and secretive plot to murder Michael by opponents of the sale.  Much of this takes place among the backdrop of Old World Italy as Michael returns home to watch his son, Anthony, perform is his first opera.  Plus, Michael hopes to rekindle the romance with his ex-wife, Kay.  Michael is hopeful that decisions he is making will help make life safer for Mary and help woo Kay back, and, in the end, allow him to fully atone for all his sins.  In true ""Godfather"" style, though, Michael's journey is wrought with difficulty and despair that would rival some of Shakespeare's own tragedies.Pacino's performance manages to give Michael the most human dimension ever seen in him.  This is a fascinating direction to take and powers the film throughout much of the three hour running time.  However, there are still a number of flaws that undermine the film.  The absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is most glaring.  The similarly patterned character of B.J. Harrison (played by George Hamilton) is serviceable, but does not nearly carry the same presence that Hagen did.  In addition, it seems that the 16-year layoff between Part II and Part III caused the ideas to go stale for director Francis Ford Coppola.  He seems to have reused many of the elements of the earlier films, without recapturing their magic.  A notable example would be Johnny Fontane serenading Connie at the beginning of the film.  It's reminiscent of the scenes at the beginning of ""The Godfather"", but doesn't seem to carry nearly the same meaning.In truth, ""Godfather, Part III"" is a completist's movie.  It doesn't stand alone and it makes very little sense if you have not seen the earlier films.  It also does not compel repeated viewings the way the first two films do.  Still, it is a good movie and it is a fitting conclusion to the saga of Michael Corleone.",4,"Not as good as the originals, but not bad, either.",1043884800,"01 30, 2003",2003,4286,"['Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'suffers', 'tremendously', 'when', 'compared', 'two', 'legendary', 'predecessors', 'simply', 'originality', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'scope', 'originals', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'movie', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'are', 'definite', 'weak', 'moments', 'performances', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'playing', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'performance', 'depth', 'power', 'necessary', 'carry', 'kind', 'material', 'work', 'novice', 'actress', 'was', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'not', 'truly', 'terrible', 'also', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'parts', 'performance', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'Still', 'nice', 'see', 'most', 'same', 'cast', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'Michael', 'Connie', 'Kay', 'Al', 'Neri', 'even', 'Johnny', 'Fontane.What', 'Part', 'III', 'hook', 'quest', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'clean', 'family', 'business', 'seek', 'redemption', 'past', 'sins', 'watching', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'menacing', 'cinematic', 'characters', 'ever', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'intriguing', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'watch', 'struggle', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'people', 'hurt', 'life', 'reaching', 'twilight', 'legacy', 'been', 'one', 'greed', 'violence', 'now', 'be', 'one', 'kindness', 'benevolence', 'course', 'once', ""'re"", 'family', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'leave', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'life', 'had', 'settled', 'accounts', 'money', 'instead', 'violence', 'fellow', 'mafioso', 'types', 'graphically', 'point', 'famous', 'quote', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'pull', 'back', 'hot-headed', 'nephew', 'Vincent', 'Mancini', 'Sonny', 'son', 'played', 'superbly', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'further', 'situation', 'incessant', 'need', 'revenge', 'behalf', 'Michael', 'illicit', 'affair', 'Mary', 'Still', 'Michael', 'can', 'overcome', 'setback', 'move', 'desire', 'crime-free', 'life', 'make', 'Corleone', 'business', 'enterprise', 'totally', 'legitimate', 'purchasing', 'international', 'conglomerate', 'Immobiliare', 'sp', 'construction', 'development', 'arm', 'Vatican', 'also', 'sever', 'ties', 'violent', 'aspect', 'business', 'transferring', 'title', 'trappings', ""'Godfather"", 'Vincent.The', 'true', 'crux', 'story', 'Michael', 'business', 'dealings', 'corrupt', 'Vatican', 'officials', 'deal', 'secretive', 'plot', 'murder', 'Michael', 'opponents', 'sale', 'Much', 'place', 'backdrop', 'Old', 'World', 'Italy', 'Michael', 'home', 'watch', 'son', 'Anthony', 'perform', 'first', 'opera', 'Michael', 'rekindle', 'romance', 'ex-wife', 'Kay', 'Michael', 'hopeful', 'decisions', 'making', 'will', 'help', 'make', 'life', 'safer', 'Mary', 'help', 'woo', 'Kay', 'back', 'end', 'allow', 'fully', 'atone', 'sins', 'true', 'Godfather', 'style', 'though', 'Michael', 'journey', 'wrought', 'difficulty', 'despair', 'would', 'rival', 'Shakespeare', 'own', 'tragedies.Pacino', 'performance', 'give', 'Michael', 'most', 'human', 'dimension', 'ever', 'seen', 'fascinating', 'direction', 'take', 'powers', 'film', 'much', 'three', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'However', 'are', 'still', 'number', 'flaws', 'undermine', 'film', 'absence', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'most', 'glaring', 'similarly', 'patterned', 'character', 'B.J', 'Harrison', 'played', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'serviceable', 'not', 'nearly', 'carry', 'same', 'presence', 'Hagen', 'did', 'addition', '16-year', 'layoff', 'Part', 'II', 'Part', 'III', 'caused', 'ideas', 'go', 'stale', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'have', 'reused', 'many', 'elements', 'earlier', 'films', 'recapturing', 'magic', 'notable', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'Johnny', 'Fontane', 'serenading', 'Connie', 'beginning', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'Godfather', ""n't"", 'seem', 'carry', 'nearly', 'same', 'meaning.In', 'truth', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'completist', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stand', 'alone', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'earlier', 'films', 'also', 'not', 'compel', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'way', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'do', 'Still', 'good', 'movie', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'saga', 'Michael', 'Corleone']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

298750,ABK0UWM2WYM7T,6302158176,Peter Benigni,"[8, 13]","Before I start my editorial review, I want to say, that this film, iven with its minor flaws, still remains one of the best Mafia Movies ever made (along with G1 and G2 of course). This film, in my opinion, is perfect, as  his famous predecessors, and deserved an Oscar (at least for Best Picture  or Director or iven Best Supporting Actor --Andy Garcia).Sixteen  years after they made &quot;The Godfather Part 2&quot;, Francis Ford  Coppola have been decided to complete the epic story of the Corleone  family.  For those who can remember back to G2, we last left Don Michael  Corleone sitting alone contemplating the fact that he had ordered the  execution of his own brother, Fredo.The third installment of the  Godfather trilogy takes place twenty years after G2.  Aging Michael  Corleone is trying to turn his dream into a reality.  His dream has been to  make the Corleone family completely legitimate.  Michael has been  attempting to do this ever since he took over control of the family at the  end of the first film, THE GODFATHER.The film opens with an old,  weary, incredibly corrupted Don Michael Corleone receiving a humanitarian  award from the Archbishop.  Michael is later approached by the Archbishop,  who has been placed in financial charge of the Vatican.  In an effort to  help the Vatican overcome their financial trouble Michael offers to donate  600  million dollars in exchange for the Vatican's controlling interest in  a company called Imobilare.  It is Michael's belief that if he can gain  control of the financially strong company he would finally be able to make  the Corleone family legitimate.  Michael encounters problems when several  members of The Vatican council refuse to give controlling interest of  Imobilare to Michael because his family is involved in organized crime.Michael is not so easily free of his former underworld allies, however.  When he makes a $600 million play for the international conglomerate  Immobiliare, they want a piece of the cake, seeing an opportunity to  launder their money.  Michael's refusal at a meeting of dons stings more  than a few of his old friends, and brings down a bloody retribution.The next Don Corleone--Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), Sonny Corleone's  illigitimate boy--is awaiting his opportunity.  He possesses a ruthlessness  and taste for violence that Michael has long since lost, and as the  Immobiliare stakes escalate, the old head of the family recognizes the need  for youth and strength.  The passing of the baton, however, carries with it  a tragic price.The plot of the movie, concocted by Coppola and  Mario Puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines, brings the Corleone  family into the inner circles of corruption in the Vatican. Actual events -  the untimely suddenness of John Paul I's death, the scandals at the Vatican  Bank, the body of a Vatican banker found hanging from a London bridge - are  cheerfully intertwined with the Corleone's fictional story, and it is  suggested that the Vatican lost hundreds of millions in a fraud. We  eavesdrop on corrupt Vatican officials, venal cardinals scheming in the  vast Renaissance palaces that dwarf them, and we travel to Sicily so that  Michael Corleone can consult with Don Tommasino, his trusted old friend  (first appeared in G1), to discover who is plotting against him within the  Mafia council.And yet it's strange how the earlier movies fill  in the gaps left by this one, and answer the questions. It is, I suspect,  not even possible to understand this film without knowing the first two,  and yet, knowing them, G3 works better than it should, evokes the same  sense of wasted greatness, of misdirected genius. Both Don Vito Corleone  and Don Michael Corleone could have been great men. But they lacked that  final shred of character that would have allowed them to break free from  their own pasts. Or perhaps their tragedies were dictated by circumstances.  Perhaps they were simply born into the wrong family.Al Pacino  returns to his familiar role as Michael Corleone, along with Diane Keaton  who reprises her role as Michael's estranged wife Kay Adams. Also  returning, is Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Michael's sister, who has  turned in middle age into a fierce, thin-faced woman in black, who stands  in the deepest shadows, who schemes and lobbies for her favorites -  especially for Vincent, whom she wants Michael to accept and embrace. Once  lineless and rendered obscure to the plot, Lucy Mancini (original actress  and all) has returned to the saga after being left behind in Part I. And  she has brought a not-so-little remnant of her affair with Santino Corleone  with her. Recall the scene in Part I when Sonny leaves Lucy's apartment  with his henchmen to pick up his sister. That was perhaps the very moment  after which the last Don Corleone was conceived. Another one of Santino's  remnants has returned to the saga in G3: his twins (Francesca and the other  one). They are now grown and still identical, and still adorable too  (unfortunately, they are not developed ever since..). Remember their line  in G2, &quot;Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!&quot; and their inclusion in  the Corleone family portrait taken at Connie's wedding. Also returning are  Al Neri, Calo (the Sicilian bodyguard), Tommassino and Johnny Fontaine  (voice still intact).The film also stars newcomers Andy Garcia as  Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son, and Sophia Coppola as Michael's  daughter.  The fine cast is also joined by veteran actors Eli Wallach,  George Hamilton and Joe Mantegna.  There is also a small role played by Don  Novello who is best remembered as Father Guido Sarducci on &quot;Saturday  Night Live.&quot;This film is beautifully filmed with splendid  cinematography of New York and Sicily, but it also contains the violence  that has become a trademark of the Godfather films.As always,  Pacino is a delight to watch.  The third time around, he brings a mournful  weariness to his character --he portrayed an aging and sick Michael  Corleone who couldn't overcome the guilt of having his brother killed.  This is a man who has paid for all the wrong choices.  Memories haunt him  like ghosts that can never be exorcised.  The emotional toll is shown in  the stoop of his shoulders and the thickness of his voice. The final scene  of the movie, Michael's death, which is intended to echo Marlon Brando's  famous death scene, is perfunctory and awkward.Family, as has ever  been the case, is crucial to Michael.  His children are his reason for  living.  In his words, &quot;The only wealth in this world is children.  More than all the money and power on Earth, [they] are my treasure.&quot;  He says to Mary that he would burn in hell to keep her safe.  It is a  prophetic statement.Of course, as I told before, this film has some  minor flaws like: Robert Duvall is missed.  It's impossible not to feel the  vacuum created by his absence.  And because Paramount didn't won't to make  his role bigger in that film, they desided to kill Tom Hagen somewhere  between G2 and G3. George Hamilton's B. J. Barrison is a one- dimensional  necessity of plot, not a &quot;real&quot; character.  At least the decision  was made not to replicate Tom Hagen in Barrison.  Hamilton is given little  more to do than stand in the background and speak a fewlines.Another unfortunate casting decision was the choice of Sofia (daughter of  Francis) Coppola as Mary (Winona Ryder, the director's preference, was  prevented by fatigue from appearing).  Coppola is pleasant enough to look  at, but her range is limited, and that lack of ability diminishes several  emotionally-charged scenes.  This is the first GODFATHER to have a major  role defined by a poor performance.Despite its missteps, THE  GODFATHER PART III packs enough of a punch to deserve a place alongside its  predecessors.  This is no poorly- conceived curiosity.  Not only does the  film bring Michael Corleone's story to a conclusion, but it remains  faithful to the form and style of parts I and II.  Taken as one grand epic,  with this chapter included, the GODFATHER movies represent one of the most  solid, emotionally-rich tales ever committed to film. And if you combine  all three films with ALL their lost scenes (especially from G1 and G2),  like &quot;The Trilogy&quot; or &quot;The Saga&quot; did, then you'll see,  that the Godfather, is purely, and simply, the BEST GANGSTER-DRAMA film  EVER made.",5,The Godfather Part 3 : A film that you can not refuse ......,958867200,"05 21, 2000",2000,8449,"['start', 'editorial', 'review', 'want', 'say',

A big part of the plot involves dealings with less than sanctified Vatican people and evil observers following the money that Michael wants to unload - as he wants to unload all of his past and go back to his pre-crime, War Hero status. Not to be.Along the way his daughter gets involved with her Cousin..and the viewer has to deal with some mildly kinky, unnecessary scenes with the two. As uncomfortable as that is, Coppolla should have stuck to it ...keeping the drama more ""local"", with Michael, now infirm, having to battle with a big question: should he do to his ""love child"" nephew what he did to his oldest Brother.

298753,A292YWWNFVSIWY,6302158176,Publius,"[5, 7]","The Godfather III has been one of the most maligned movies in recent times.  The truth is the movie is not that bad.  In the first two movies, as Michael Corleone descends into his pitiful existence, the audience sees Michael suffer for his terrible sins only once, when Kay aborts her child.  However, we never see the guilt, remorse and sorrow that Michael exhibits in Godfather III.  One of the criticisms leveled at this movie is that Michael does not die a violent death at the hands of his enemies.  He suffers a far worse fate, as he sees his daughter die before his eyes.  In the director's commentary for the disc, Coppola says that `there is not a worse way to pay for your sins then to see your children suffer.'  In this way, the movie acts sort of as a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Sofia took the critics relentless assaults against her acting.  As for Michael, we see him at the end of the original movie as triumphant, but at the end of Godfather II, we see him victorious but it has cost him  his family.  At the end of the third part, he is broken, beaten and destroyed.  He did confess his sins, but still orders murders, and his ultimate punishment is to see his daughter die.  Coppola has not betrayed the cinematic integrity of the first two films, but just elevated the punishment that Michael must face.  In the first two movies, we are left wondering whether Michael has felt remorse for the life that he has led.  At the end of Godfather III, as he screams on the concert hall steps, we finally see the remorse and glimpse the human being that he once was, instead of the old, crippled mafia chieftan that he became.",3,Ultimate Punishment,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,1641,"['Godfather', 'III', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'maligned', 'movies', 'recent', 'times', 'truth', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'pitiful', 'existence', 'audience', 'Michael', 'suffer', 'terrible', 'sins', 'only', 'once', 'when', 'Kay', 'child', 'However', 'never', 'see', 'guilt', 'remorse', 'sorrow', 'Michael', 'Godfather', 'III', 'One', 'criticisms', 'leveled', 'movie', 'Michael', 'not', 'die', 'violent', 'death', 'hands', 'enemies', 'far', 'worse', 'fate', 'daughter', 'die', 'eyes', 'director', 'commentary', 'disc', 'Coppola', 'not', 'worse', 'way', 'pay', 'sins', 'then', 'see', 'children', 'suffer', 'way', 'movie', 'sort', 'self-fulfilling', 'prophecy', 'Sofia', 'took', 'critics', 'relentless', 'assaults', 'acting', 'Michael', 'see', 'end', 'original', 'movie', 'triumphant', 'end', 'Godfather', 'II', 'see', 'victorious', 'cost', 'family', 'end', 'third', 'part', 'broken', 'beaten', 'destroyed', 'did', 'confess', 'sins', 'still', 'orders', 'murders', 'ultimate', 'punishment', 'see', 'daughter', 'die', 'Coppola', 'not', 'betrayed', 'cinematic', 'integrity', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'just', 'elevated', 'punishment', 'Michael', 'must', 'face', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'Michael', 'felt', 'remorse', 'life', 'led', 'end', 'Godfather', 'III', 'concert', 'hall', 'steps', 'finally', 'see', 'remorse', 'glimpse', 'human', 'being', 'once', 'was', 'instead', 'old', 'crippled', 'mafia', 'chieftan', 'became']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"
298754,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,6302158176,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[1, 1]","When I read the review posted by the associated press upon the release of this film, the journalist entitled the review ""The icing on the cake"". I think that was a more than fair assessment. The Godfather pt. III is generally an excellent third installment, but it is not without some serious flaws. The biggest of which is Francis Coppola casting his daughter Sofia in a major role as Michael's daughter, Mary. Francis Coppola chose to cast his daughter for three reasons. The first being that originally Winona Ryder was schedualed to be cast in the part, but she developed some health issue and couldn't participate. Secondly is because Sofia had a natural sicillian beauty that made her visually perfect for the role. Thirdly Coppola had already used numerous family members in the production of the first two films, who had tasks as important as playing major characters and writing the score for the film. Unfortunately Sofia's acting ranges from dreadful to fairly good. There are other obvious weaknesses here and there as well. One that bothered me was just before Michael confesses his sins to a priest in Rome, he suffers a diabetic attack and asks for some orange juice or candy. The priest sends a man off who returns less than 10 seconds later with a tray that included both candy and a pitcher of orange juice, with a glass of the juice already poured. One example of several rediculous weaknesses in this film that are nearly unforgivable. But they are easily forgiven because there are many truly powerfully directed moments in the film that easily companion themselves in the same epic league as the first two films did. The last third of this film is master film making at it's absolute best.

Frankly, I have mixed emotions about it because, when discussing it, I want to be fair and focus on it as a discrete film, judging it on its own terms; however, for me at least, that is impossible because it is the third of three Godfather films and its two predecessors are masterpieces. I cannot exclude vivid memories of scenes and even comments from films I first saw 18 and then 14 years before seeing this one for the first time in 1990. OK, that's my challenge. I finally decided to try to rate it on its own terms, hence the Three Stars. What it has going for it includes Pacino's talent, several plausible conflicts, brilliant cinematography, and a tone of melancholy which is consistent throughout the narrative. After years of broken promises to wife Kay (Diane Keaton), Michael has almost completed a process by which to extricate himself and his family from organized crime. However, his marriage has ended, mortal enemies remain such as Altobello (Eli Wallach) and Joey Zaza (Joe Montegna), his negotiations with the Vatican encounter unexpected complications, and finally, his physical health is poor as pressures and tensions in his life intensify. It is no wonder that he suffers a diabetic attack in his kitchen (""Just when I think I'm out...."") from which he never fully recovers.However, the film has several problems. One concerns the lack of a primary plot to give the narrative cohesion. There are hundreds of individual episodes in The Godfather and Godfather Part II (as in other films such as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago) but they are coordinated effectively. Not so of the episodes in this film. Sofia Coppola's performance as Mary Corleone has been savaged by most critics. In fact, she is reputed to be a late replacement for Wynona Rider, had no prior acting experience in films, and was given a role as trivial as Anne Archer's in the three Jack Ryan films. I will not join others in bashing her. Another of the film's flaws is director Coppola and the three screenwriters' failure to do more with the role of Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia). So many missed opportunities as Garcia's great talents are under-utilized, especially when on-screen with his obviously exhausted Uncle Michael. The illegitimate son of Santino (""Sonny"") Corleone, Vincent is only occasionally allowed to show some of his father's passion, providing energy which this film desperately needs and otherwise lacks.The jumpy plot and underdeveloped characters are, in my opinion, this film's major weakness but it has several fine moments as when Vincent challenges Zaza, when Michael meets with Cardinal Lamberto (Raf Vallone), the deadly sequence as the performance in the opera house proceeds to its conclusion, and the final scene when Michael reflects upon his empty life. Judged only on its own terms, Three Stars.

298758,A1MN1Y3QNUFRBE,6302158176,"Robert W. Berg ""Rob""","[39, 64]","I had to write this review, because I am extremely offended by some of the comments made by the viewer from Derby... &quot;Godfather 3 is a masterpiece, pure and simple, far surpassing its morally bankrupt predecessors. Anyone who says otherwise has no understanding of character, theme and plotting...and can safely be ignored.&quot; Well, I'm sorry, but I refuse to be ignored. For one, this third film, while it does show Michael attempting to legitimize the family business is not any less &quot;morally bankrupt&quot; than the other two.  This film is in fact much more shocking and graphic in its violence, including some particularly gory ear-bitings, and machine-gunnings that were certainly not needed.  Further, there seemed to be a code of honor in the first two films.  The younger characters show none of this code. Vincent is a ticking time bomb, and Mary is a seemingly virginal but duplicitous character. Wouldn't you call an affair between two first cousins &quot;morally bankrupt&quot;?!? Michael, who claims to have put the Mafia business behind him, once again returns out of revenge. This is morally bankrupt as well. As far as the comment that any one who does not think so has no understanding of character, theme, and plotting, let me tell you that not only did this film lack focus, it lacked energy. It was much more slow-moving than the other films, sometimes torturously show.  Further, the plot never maintained interest, mostly due to the fact that these new, younger characters are neither compelling nor very likable. I go into the &quot;Godfather&quot; films expecting to see &quot;Godfather&quot; characters, not their children. Children, who, may I say, were atrociously acted, without feeling or depth. I had trouble maintaining my composure through this film. In the other two films, I hung onto every word, trying to piece together the labyrinthine plots. In this one, I left a number of times to go to the bathroom, get a bite to eat, etc, and did not care that I had missed a little. In fact, I hoped that I had just so the movie would end faster. The only reason I would recommend this film, when I would prefer to just pretend it never happened, is the great scenes between Al Pacino and Diane Keaton.  Kay was always the only character who could speak up to Michael, and it was fascinating to see both of these characters in a later part of their lives, continuing their verbal sparing, but still somewhere deep down caring for each other. So prepare to grab your fast forward button and careen swiftly through the few brilliant scenes of this failed conclusion (and skip the end while you're at it). And to the viewer in Derby--if you truly believe that this film is the best of the series, that this movie has great character, theme, and plotting, you are allowed. But the vast majority will not only tell you that you are wrong, but ignorant as well. Anyone who cannot differentiate the true artistry of filmmaking in the first two &quot;Godfather&quot; films and the hastily slapped together, poorly acted mess that is &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; is in serious need of an education.",1,A regrettable conclusion to a brilliant trilogy...,993081600,"06 21, 2001",2001,3136,"['had', 'write', 'review', 'am', 'extremely', 'offended', 'comments', 'made', 'viewer', 'Derby', 'quot', '3', 'masterpiece', 'pure', 'simple', 'far', 'surpassing', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'predecessors', 'Anyone', 'who', 'otherwise', 'understanding', 'character', 'theme', 'plotting', 'can', 'safely', 'be', 'ignored.', 'quot', 'Well', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'refuse', 'be', 'ignored', 'one', 'third', 'film', 'show', 'Michael', 'attempting', 'legitimize', 'family', 'business', 'not', 'less', 'quot', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'quot', 'other', 'two', 'film', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'shocking', 'graphic', 'violence', 'including', 'particularly', 'gory', 'ear-bitings', 'machine-gunnings', 'were', 'certainly', 'not', 'needed', 'Further', 'seemed', 'be', 'code', 'honor', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'younger', 'characters', 'show', 'none', 'code', 'Vincent', 'ticking', 'time', 'bomb', 'Mary', 'seemingly', 'virginal', 'duplicitous', 'character', 'Would', ""n't"", 'call', 'affair', 'two', 'first', 'cousins', 'quot', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'quot', 'Michael', 'who', 'have', 'put', 'Mafia', 'business', 'once', 'again', 'revenge', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'as', 'well', 'As', 'far', 'comment', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'understanding', 'character', 'theme', 'plotting', 'let', 'tell', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'film', 'lack', 'focus', 'lacked', 'energy', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'slow-moving', 'other', 'films', 'sometimes', 'torturously', 'show', 'Further', 'plot', 'never', 'maintained', 'interest', 'mostly', 'due', 'fact', 'new', 'younger', 'characters', 'are', 'compelling', 'very', 'likable', 'go', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'films', 'expecting', 'see', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'characters', 'not', 'children', 'Children', 'who', 'may', 'say', 'were', 'atrociously', 'acted', 'feeling', 'depth', 'had', 'trouble', 'maintaining', 'composure', 'film', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'hung', 'word', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'labyrinthine', 'plots', 'one', 'left', 'number', 'times', 'go', 'bathroom', 'get', 'bite', 'eat', 'etc', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'had', 'missed', 'little', 'fact', 'hoped', 'had', 'just', 'so', 'movie', 'would', 'end', 'faster', 'only', 'reason', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'when', 'would', 'prefer', 'just', 'pretend', 'never', 'happened', 'great', 'scenes', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Kay', 'was', 'always', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'speak', 'up', 'Michael', 'was', 'fascinating', 'see', 'characters', 'later', 'part', 'lives', 'continuing', 'verbal', 'sparing', 'still', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'down', 'caring', 'other', 'So', 'prepare', 'grab', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'careen', 'swiftly', 'few', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'failed', 'conclusion', 'end', ""'re"", 'viewer', 'Derby', 'truly', 'believe', 'film', 'best', 'series', 'movie', 'great', 'character', 'theme', 'plotting', 'are', 'allowed', 'vast', 'majority', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'tell', 'are', 'wrong', 'ignorant', 'well', 'Anyone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'differentiate', 'true', 'artistry', 'filmmaking', 'first', 'two', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'films', 'hastily', 'slapped', 'together', 'poorly', 'acted', 'mess', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'quot', 'serious', 'need', 'education']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

I think it is the best and most deeply moving piece of the Trilogy.It is about the end game of the quintessential idealist, Michael Corleone.Whereas his father (Marlin Brando) was the honor bound pragmatist, his brother Sonny was the violent loose cannon, his brother Freco was the gutless whiner, Michael was moved by his ideals and what he considered was right.In Godfather 1, we see him throwing away his ideals for Family protection, and in Godfather 2, we see him turned to stone by his own actions.  This is stressed in the Birthday party scene at the end of Godfather 2.In Godfather 3, we see a sick and dying Godfather haunted by the once idealistic Michael Corleone he was.  The idealism is returning to him, and of neccesity there had to be recompence for the earlier sins he did.  Yet the Sins of the Father affected all of his attempted repentance.  He paid the ultimate price at the end by the death of his daughter being part of the neccesary attonement.  And after all that, in the end, he has visions of dancing with the most important women in his life, all which he threw away by his behavior.

298761,A3DC53MM1NGLBB,6302158176,Sean,"[4, 7]","""You know, Michael; now that you're so respectable, I think you're more dangerous than ever. I liked you better when you were just a common Mafia hood.""I have finally seen all three entries in The Godfather trilogy. Part III is widely considered a bad film and has been named one of the worst sequels of all time. But after finally seeing all three movies I can justly say that this movie is not deserving of the bad rep it gets.In the final installment of the Godfather Trilogy, an aging Don Michael Corleone seeks to legitimize his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld but is kept back by the ambitions of the young. While he attempts to link the Corleone's finances with the Vatican, Michael must deal with the machinations of a hungrier gangster seeking to upset the existing Mafioso order and a young prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s love affair with his daughter.This movie was probably not necessary but its here and although it is leagues behind Parts I and II, its still a great movie. I think that's it greatest fault too, that its predecessor's were so great that it couldn't help but be inferior. Al Pacino gives us an aged Michael Corleone but, at least to me, he wasn't as believable as he was in the previous two. Here he was Al Pacino and lacked the intensity and, well, believability of the character he showed previously. Maybe that's because of the character's age and he's so different than what we have perceived him as in the other two movies. But, you eventually accept him again as Michael and Pacino gives another stellar performance. Talia Shire returns as Connie, Michael's sister only this time she tries to pull some strings and get into things. Shire's performance is good but the problem is that this is unbelievable for the character. In the previous two Godfather films she was there, not involved in the business in any way and suddenly here she's thrown herself into the fray. Andy Garcia plays Vinnie, Sonny's illegitimate son. He plays Pacino Sonny's role in the original Godfather and it seems he's trying to imitate James Caan's presence instead of being his son. It works in the long run but it feels like he could have done something more with the character. Diane Keaton is Michael's ex-wife Kay. She doesn't really do much until near the end of the movie and seems like she is only there to further the ending of the movie. Her role is very detached from what she did in Parts I and II where she was Michael's loving wife whom he was trying to hold on to. Here, she's married to another man and doesn't have an impact on Michael until, as I said, the ending and even there her role isn't vital. Sofia Coppola is Mary Corleone, Michael's daughter, and she completely slaughters the character. Did she know that this film wasn't a comedy? She doesn't speak in the movie, she awkwardly yells and is reminiscent of the stereotypical bad actor that reads their lines monotonously. And George Hamilton takes over Robert Duvall's role as B.J. Harrison. George Hamilton? Whoever the hell decided to replace Duvall after he refused to reprise his role should be shot but then to go and cast George Hamilton was just wrong. He sticks out and I was waiting for him to rip open a bad of Baked Ritz crackers and start munching on them. I'm sorry but I just couldn't take him seriously. The rest of the cast does their job well and their really isn't a weak link outside of Sofia.I personally didn't think the music was as good as it was in the previous two installments. There wasn't anything memorable outside of the ""Godfather Waltz"". That's not to say it was bad, because it wasn't. The music perfectly complemented each scene it was used in. It's just that it wasn't as good as previous efforts.I don't think this should have been called The Godfather Part III, it should have been titled The Godfather: The Musical because after every few scenes another musical piece would pop up. This, accompanied with the editing, made it feel like a TV movie. At the end of 97% of each scene the transition was a fade to black. I was honestly expecting a commercial to pop up one of these times. There were just too many musical pieces in the film as well. We get a long one at the beginning, a few shorter ones scattered throughout the middle and another long one at the end. The whole final movement of the film in which two intrigues are inter cut with Anthony performing in an opera are supposed to be suspenseful, but they're not. They're so confusing that we don't even know where the hell one of the intrigues is taking place. Is it in Rome? Sicily? London? I don't know.The whole of the movie is a tad convoluted and hard to believe. Michael is trying to go legit with...the Vatican? This only adds to the confusion of the movie. This entry is easier to grasp and understand what's going on than Part II was but you are left scratching your head at some points. This will definitely require a second viewing just as Part II does. Another problem is that this feels like a sequel unlike Part II, which felt like a natural continuation of the original. You're also just thrown into this world without so much as an introduction or a re acquaintance to some characters so you're left to figure it out on your own which can be pretty annoying when you're trying to do that and follow the complex storyline all at once. But one of the biggest eyebrow raisers is the incest plotline. That's right. Vinnie and Mary are first cousins but are in love with each other. The movie even acknowledges that this is wrong but it's still kept. At the it is supposed to hit us hard due to the circumstances but it just doesn't because you didn't believe in it in the first place because it is wrong. That plotline was unneeded and came out of left field. That was probably the worst addition to this film next to Sofia herself.But what really brings this movie together is its spectacular ending. The whole scene on the steps is superbly shot and you really feel the raw surge of emotion that's going on in that scene. You feel for Michael because of everything he did to try and right his wrongs thus far. But directly after that is the death of Michael Corleone which is tragic yet fulfilling. He is 77 years old and retired to Sicily, alone and distraught when he dies from a stroke. Before he dies he thinks of the women he loved and ultimately lost due to his choices in life. We feel for this character and when he dies, at least with me, a surge of emotion came over because you think back to the journey we went through with this man and here is the end of a legacy. The whole way it is shot and presented struck a chord with me and was the highlight of the movie Michael is alone with nobody left because they are either dead or have left him. It's a sad way to go but perfectly executed here. The music that accompanies it is superb as well. It isn't an original piece conducted for the movie but it works amazingly well. It adds so much to the scene and is a great listen on its own. I cannot say enough good things about this ending. Its just superb and a truly great way to end this monumental series.The Godfather Part III is a great movie. It isn't up to snuff with its predecessors but it can't be expected to be. It is wholly undeserving of the bad rep it gets because underneath, there is a great movie that has just gotten flack for being inferior and a sequel. Despite some rough edges and lacking in areas that the original two excelled in, The Godfather Part III is very worthy of bearing the Godfather name.",3,Not really all that bad,1158537600,"09 18,

298763,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,6302158176,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[6, 8]","Nominated for several major Oscars, the curiously underrated THE GODFATHER: PART III (1990) is the work of a master filmmaker--Francis Ford Coppola--still at the peak of his powers.  Filmed on location in New York City, Rome, and Sicily, the movie is a feast for gangster film lovers.  For starters, it has all been elegantly designed by Dean Tavoularis and costumed by Milena Canonero almost entirely in browns and blacks and whites.  And I believe the great Gordon Willis finally got his GODFATHER Oscar nomination for brilliant cinematography.  This is filmmaking of a very high order.Essentially, the story has the Corleone family coming to Vatican City around 1980 to give a huge sum of money--blood money--to the Catholic church, and the church in Rome trying to decide whether to take such a huge sum of blood money.  There is more than enough violence to satisfy red meat GODFATHER fans, especially a massacre inside an Atlantic City casino, a street shooting during an Elizabeth Street (lower Manhattan) festival, an elegant don (a great Eli Wallach) eating poisoned pastry (!), and the elaborate climax inside a Sicilian opera house during a performance of ""Cavalleria Rusticana"".  The opera action mirrors killings similtaneously taking place all through the opera house.But this is a very mellow and poignant drama, with the violence really in the background.  It was made a full sixteen years after the Oscar-winning Part Two (1974), and the actors are also sixteen years older.  Al Pacino plays Michael very quiet and low-keyed as the character deals with diabetes and a weak heart.  He has made peace with former wife Kay (a never-better or lovelier Diane Keaton).  Kay stands in a darkened study looking at a photo from Lake Tahoe in part two, her younger self.  Much later, she and Michael will travel to Sicily; he will show her some of the places he grew up in and hid out in from the first movie (1972).  Much later still, there is a montage with Michael and daughter Mary (a much maligned and quite charming Sofia Coppola), then Michael in part one dancing with his doomed Sicilian bride, then Michael and Kay dancing at Lake Tahoe in part two.The movies play off one another so beautifully when seen on consecutive nights.The grand party in the first half hour is pure Coppola home movie and wonderful, with everyone having a great time eating and dancing in Canonero's beautiful costumes.  I especially cherish a throwaway improvisation moment that Coppola clearly adores on the audio commentary:  young Gia Coppola wants to dance with Mary and Michael, so a two-some becomes a three-some.  Very lovely.  And, incidentally, I LIKE Sofia Coppola in this movie.  Damn it, she is nervous and vulnerable, but that is what the character of Mary calls for!  She is perfect for the role, better than originally cast Winona Ryder would have been, and Coppola is obviously proud to have her in the movie as a home movie on his commentary.  Her scenes with Andy Garcia are very touching, and Coppola hilariously adds a recipe for Yukki in the movie.  ""My movies should at very least have one food recipe in them,"" he hilariously notes.  Corleone movie fans will also remember that baby Sofia was the infant Michael at the end of part one in 1972.It is no secret that I have been hospitalized for two heart attacks in the past fifteen years.  And I have diabetes.  So the scenes with a hospitalized Michael (recalling his father--Brando's Don Vito in the first film--hospitalized), and Michael needing orange juice and a chocolate bar in a Vatican City garden after a diabetic attack, have a special poignancy for me.  There is also a dark comedy moment in that same (or a similar) Vatican City garden where Michael wants to confess his sins to priest Raf Vallone.  As Vallone listens patiently to the confessions, including having his sister's husband and his brother Fredo killed, he gasps.  But he tells Michael sympathetically that God forgives him if he will sin no more.  It is a hilarious scene, but Michael does not take his advice because the film's last half hour is a bloodbath.  One death on the opera house steps after the performance, and a silent agony scream from Michael, packs a wallop.  The very last scene is quiet and deeply moving.  Corleone family movie fans will definitely be very satisfied.  And be glad that Coppola's original title was not used; it would have given away the ending!THE GODFATHER: PART THREE runs 170 minutes in its Authorized Director's Cut, which is nine minutes longer than the 161 minute theatrical version.  It flows smoothly and leisurely, with a skillful blending of brutal murder scenes and quiet domestic moments.  The brilliant and Oscar-winning film editors are Barry Malkin, Lisa Fruchtman, and Walter Murch.  Coppola truly misses Robert Duvall as the family lawyer, on the audio commentary, and is much too hard on replacement George Hamilton.  I think Hamilton is very good in a few scenes, but agree that Duvall would have been better.  I also think, again, that Sofia Coppola, now an Oscar-winning filmmaker (LOST IN TRANSLATION), is satisfying as the likeable and poignant Mary.  Joe Mantegna has a few powerful scenes as Joey Zaza.  And Eli Wallach is magnificent as an aging villain.Should there be a GODFATHER IV?  Francis Coppola discusses that on the audio commentary to my deluxe DVD boxed set.  Even after two decades, Paramount executives were still hassling him--begging him to make another GODFATHER film for them, but it absolutely MUST be in theaters for Christmas 1990.  That was an enormous challenge that included writing the original script with Mario Puzo and filming all over the world, then editing a three hour movie within one year.  When Michael says in a kitchen set, ""Just when I think I am out, they pull me back in!"", that was also Francis talking about making another GODFATHER film.  But he makes them so well!  And obviously was still supervising final cut editing when the movie hit home video.I think Coppola has a good twenty years of filmmaking left in him.  Anyone can make good wine.  Maybe Sofia could help on the screenplay as an Oscar-winning screenwriter.  Maybe that, and definitely not acting, is her niche.  There is so much material with the Corleone family left to tell.  Intercut the 1930's and 1940's with the 1990's, like Part Two, as a four hour HBO blockbuster.  Or just do the 1930's and 1940's for three hours theatrically.  If you watch the chronological order recut movie, there is a jarring gap of fifteen years between Michael leaving Sicily in 1930 and Bonasera talking with Don Vito in 1945 New York City.  What exactly happens to this family during the Depression and World War Two?  I'd love to know, and I'd love to have a still master filmmaker tell me.  Until that future time, we have three excellent GODFATHER films that play off one another poignantly and powerfully on DVD when watched on three consecutive nights--actually four, including the bonus

298764,AYKM1B74OLEVC,6302158176,Story Charts,"[2, 3]","The Godfather: Part III continues the theme of Family from the first two movies. In The Godfather, Michael had undergone an internal arc to go from outsider to Don of the family, dropping most of his morals along the way in order to protect the family. In The Godfather: Part II, this idea of the ends justify the means is taken to its logical extreme as Michael tears the family apart in order to protect it.In Part III, Michael tries to make the family legitimate in order to redeem himself. Unlike the first movie, where Michael's internal change happens on screen, and unlike the second movie, where Michael's does not change at all, this movie has Michael shifting gears to try to pay for his past sins. But this change does not take place on screen. Michael starts the movie regretting his distance from his children and spends the whole movie trying to make up, his internal compass does not change through the movie.So all we are left are two external plot lines: Michael's efforts to legitimize being constantly thwarted and his failure to protect his family because of his past sins keep catching up to him.The movie seems to be about something like ""Crime will never let you escape"". But the movie doesn't really prove this because so much of what Michael is paying for is offscreen and in the past two movies.

Uh-huh...  Francis Ford Coppola is a very talented director, so why on earth he cast his daughter in the role of Mary when she can't act is beyond me.  I find it hard to believe he just couldn't find anybody at the last minute to take Ryder's place.  In my opinion Sofia is what brings the movie down.  If you can get past her performance, the movie works for me on most levels.  Andy Garcia gives a very strong and believable portrayal of Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son and while I've never been a big Al Pacino fan, he does a creditable job of showing Michael trying to get out and stay out of the family business, and being relentlessly pulled back in.  I particularly liked the interplay between Michael and Kay late in the film, and in my opinion Diane Keaton is outstanding in showing the conflicting emotions she has always felt toward her former husband and the father of her children.  The Catholic church politics and scandal was interesting.  The scene after the opera on the steps I felt Pacino way overdid.

298768,A1BLYVBI0N2U8Y,6302158176,"T. Francois ""tfrancois""","[1, 3]","I have tried many times to give this film an honest chance; to try to judge it on its own merits.  I have found it impossible a task.  Just as difficult as Coppola might have found it to attempt to live up to the two preceding MASTERPIECES that Godfather I and II were, I find it just as hard to give this film a fair shake in attempting to allow it to stand on its own.The film is lacking in so many areas it saddens me.  First of all, and please bare with me because I'm a fan of this actor, I think Andy Garcia was DREADFUL in this movie.  I think that although he has been brilliant in other films, I found in this 3rd installment of the series his performance was way too ""LOUD"", uneven and over the top.  The first two Godfather movies excelled primarily because of the writing, cinematography, and lastly (and most importantly): the way in which the actors achieved artistic excellence via their minimalist performances.  Garcia seems to have been lost on this latter notion of less is more.  He, in a sense, ruins the movie by attempting to overshadow all that has come before him by seemingly and purposefully playing the role of the Corleone heir-apparent with a sense of artistic entitlement, pompousness, boisterousness and borderline obnoxiousness that DOES NOT bode well for him or the producers of the film.  I don't know how intentional this may or may not have been, but I think he could have achieved a better result had he opted to ""tone down"" significantly the way he interpreted the role while still being able to convey the true reckless nature and spirit of a younger Corleone who, in true-to-life like fashion, inherits the personalistic traits of volatility and hothead-edness of his late father.  It's a shame that Duvall, DeNiro and Pacino couldn't have better served him by counseling him during the making of the film.  Clearly these ACTORS know their craft and should have impressed upon the younger Garcia on what licenses he should or shouldn't have taken in order to preserve the consistency and continuity of the lead acting roles in this trilogy.  Its a failure that permanently harms the film and tarnishes an otherwise satisfactory track record up to this point.I think the 2nd most tragic thing about this film is the decision of the director to cast his inexperienced daughter in the role of Marie.  This is clearly nepitism at its worst.  She is HORRIBLE in this film.  Simply terrible.  It made NO sense to do this and I think the outcry that came about because of it is well-deserved, although I do remember being stunned by the level of negative press about it at the time the movie came out.  I make no apology for now having finally agreeing with every bit of it.All in all, I think the movie is salvageable because it had the almost undaunting task of having a lot to live up to.  Godfather I and II are UNDOUBTEDLY among the 10 BEST films of all time.  How could you top or even compete with these two originals?  Simply put, it would have been impossible.  Al Pacino, although less effective in this installment, is still a standard by which all good acting should be measured.  Diane Keaton is HEROIC in the way she is able to reprise her role so well, having for me the distinction of being the ONLY actor in the film who seems to carry over her  performance almost EXACTLY from one film to the next.  And in the absence of the work she does here, the film would have no ""tie that binds"" other than the storyline that, for me, CONTINUES...but doesn't necessarily CONVINCE.Godfather III is worth renting and worth watching.  The problem for me is that it is not worthy of being in the same class of the two films that precede it.  And that is the biggest tragedy of the Corleone saga alone.  It has a beginning, a middle, and NO END.  Just a feeble attempt at one.",2,I hate to pile on...but this film disappoints in comparison.

In this case, that's not a good thing.  In this lackluster sequel to &quot;The Godfather, part II&quot; we find the Corleone family twenty years later in 1979.  Michael is older, suffers from diabetes, and struggles to live down his past as a mafia thug.  He teams up with the Vatican to do charity work, but the ghosts of his background continue to haunt him.  Can Michael renew his life as a &quot;legit&quot; businessman?  Can he ever reconcile with Kay, the mother of his two kids?  The above sounds like an interesting premise, but &quot;the Godfather, part III,&quot; though not awful, lacks the magic and brilliance of its two predecessors.  First off, Franis Ford Coppola replaced the suave Robert Duvall for George Hamilton as the attorney Tom Hagen.  Secondly, he casts his own daughter, Sophia, as the role of Michael's daughter, Mary.  Sophia's performance isn't the disaster people say it is, but it still comes across as amateurish.  And, finally, the film is directed with all the passion of a filmmaker who's in it for the money.  That's because Coppola, reeling from a string of critical and commercial flops in the 1980s, needed a hit badly, so he returned to familiar territory and released this film, which certainly did not deserve a Best Picture Oscar nomination in 1990.  What works?  Well, Andy Garcia lights things up as the son of the hotheaded Sonny, and his character is just as tempermental.  It's also interesting to a degree to see Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire revive their respective roles.  Otherwise, the film isn't a bust, but it's a surprisingly average movie, with a few lines of dialogue that seem awkward as they are cringeworthy.

If you loved the first two, it's not hard to fall in love with this part.Al Pacino is back as Michael, and does a truly wonderfull job. He plays Michael in a way you haven't seen before. He shows the more emotional, regretfull side of the character.Andy Garcia is the one that really steals the show along with Pacino. He plays Vincent, the cousin of Michael with such great acting and style, that you get really impressed by him.Then a part most people complain about, and I think that is totally unnessesary: Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter. She really is a pleasure for the eye and acts wonderfull. I agree that it wasn't a performance for oscar gold, but she plays Mary like a normal girl. She was the right choice for the part.

Maddison ""Tim Maddison""","[7, 12]","I really am amazed that anyone can find something positive about this awful travesty, let alone pick out poor Sophia Copolla for derision - there are far more fundamentally awful things about this movie than her merely unremarkable performance, believe me! The film gives the impression of an entirely strange director finding the abandonned clothes of the first two films and putting them on himself - it really is like that, a peculiar, rather 'off' imitation of someone you know and love. Music, set pieces, themes, characters are all shamelessly rehashed from the first two parts - and honestly to what end? What more about Michael, his life and his family legacy do we learn that we didn't already know? No ending could more definitively convey the shattering of a man's life through his actions' impact on others close to him than the silent coda to Part II (to my mind without doubt one of the top 5 greatest American films), certainly not the overblown operatic hysteria we have here, nor the unintentionally almost comic re-hash of that original spine-tingling moment that ends this film. Copolla was clearly aiming at a certain 'operatic' look and feel in many aspects of the film, but the end results are so ham-fisted in places as to be close to laughable; a good example being poor Talia Shire's bizarre turn as a sort of black-clad Queen of the Night. Dialogue between the Mafiosi is so cliched and leaden in places as to be simply unbelievable any more. The 'borrowings' from the first two films are just too blatant and purposeless to be anything other than irritating; Eli Wallach's character (extraordinarily over-acted), the older father figure who is secretly trying to betray Michael, is a transparent re-hash of Hyman Roth; We have an assasination in the midst of the feast of St Genero and so on and so forth. The two strands of the film, Michael's attempt at legitimacy and redemption and the fact-based dubious shennanigans at the Vatican Bank never really gel either, in such contrast to Part II in which the themes of personal and institutional corruption were seamless. It's possible that there was a film to be made about Michael Corleone's later life - it's true that his torment at the end of Part II does leave the door open - but if there was, it needed a much more original approach than this overblown farago offers.",1,Turgid and ludicrous.

298777,AV5G37VFE5NVD,6302158176,Tom Benton,"[1, 2]","At the end of the 1980s, Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios was nearly bankrupt.  Zoetrope needed money, and it didn't take a genius to figure out how to get it.  They would make another GODFATHER movie.  And that is how, sixteen years after THE GODFATHER: PART II, we were given THE GODFATHER: PART III.The film begins in 1979.  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has finally given up his life of crime and is building a reputation as a respectable philanthropist.  When Victor Mancini (Andy Garcia), the illegitimate son of Michael's deceased brother Sonny, asks Michael for work, Michael finds himself drawn in once more to a life of crime.  Cocky gangster Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) starts a gang war while Victor falls in love with Michael's daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola), deepening Michael's troubles.  As an enraged Michael says, ""Just when I thought that I was out, they PULL me back in!""That was the mood of many audiences as well.In defense of the film, THE GODFATHER: PART III is far from a bad movie.  In fact, it's a very good movie.  However, when compared to the first two GODFATHER films - arguably the greatest movies ever made - PART III looks very, very weak.  For the most part, the acting is excellent.  Pacino is very moving.  His performance as Michael in this film closer resembles the younger Michael from THE GODFATHER than the ruthless fiend from THE GODFATHER: PART II.  Andy Garcia as Victor, Michael's young protege, is excellent.  Returning cast members Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are great.  George Hamilton's character is a substitute for Robert Duvall, who couldn't agree to the low paycheck for the film.  Bridget Fonda has a brief, but enjoyable, appearance.  The big flaw in the cast is Sofia Coppola.  Sofia, Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, is now best-known for directing films such as THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and LOST IN TRANSLATION.  As a director, she is very talented; as an actor, she is not so talented.  Sofia is woefully miscast as Michael Corleone's daughter, though Winona Ryder - the original choice for Mary Corleone, who had to pull out at the last minute to perform in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS - would have been miscast as well.Coppola's directing and his script, co-written by GODFATHER author Mario Puzo, is great, but it lacks the power and feeling that it had in the original GODFATHER movies.  Gordon Willis' cinematography, which was magnificent in the original films, isn't half as impressive here, though it has its moments.  The real problem with THE GODFATHER: PART III is that it shouldn't exist.  Though it is an interesting addition to the saga, it was made for money, not because it needed to be made, and to say it pales in comparison to parts I and II is an understatement.  Still, I would recommend seeing it, if only to quell your curiousity, and for the film's ending, which is truly stellar.",4,"An unnecessary conclusion to the GODFATHER saga, but not a bad film",1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,2855,"['end', '1980s', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Zoetrope', 'Studios', 'was', 'nearly', 'bankrupt', 'Zoetrope', 'needed', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'genius', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'would', 'make', 'GODFATHER', 'movie', 'how', 'sixteen', 'years', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'II', 'were', 'given', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'III.The', 'film', '1979', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'finally', 'given', 'up', 'life', 'crime', 'building', 'reputation', 'respectable', 'philanthropist', 'When', 'Victor', 'Mancini', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Michael', 'deceased', 'brother', 'Sonny', 'Michael', 'work', 'Michael', 'drawn', 'once', 'more', 'life', 'crime', 'Cocky', 'gangster', 'Joey', 'Zasa', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'gang', 'war', 'Victor', 'love', 'Michael', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'deepening', 'Michael', 'troubles', 'enraged', 'Michael', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'out', 'PULL', 'back', 'was', 'mood', 'many', 'audiences', 'well.In', 'defense', 'film', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'III', 'far', 'bad', 'movie', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'However', 'when', 'compared', 'first', 'two', 'GODFATHER', 'films', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'PART', 'III', 'very', 'very', 'weak', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Pacino', 'very', 'moving', 'performance', 'Michael', 'film', 'closer', 'younger', 'Michael', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'ruthless', 'fiend', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'II', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Victor', 'Michael', 'young', 'protege', 'excellent', 'Returning', 'cast', 'members', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'are', 'great', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'character', 'substitute', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'low', 'paycheck', 'film', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'brief', 'enjoyable', 'appearance', 'big', 'flaw', 'cast', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Sofia', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'daughter', 'now', 'best-known', 'directing', 'films', 'such', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'director', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'not', 'so', 'talented', 'Sofia', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'daughter', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'original', 'choice', 'Mary', 'Corleone', 'who', 'had', 'pull', 'out', 'last', 'minute', 'perform', 'EDWARD', 'SCISSORHANDS', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'miscast', 'well.Coppola', 'directing', 'script', 'co-written', 'GODFATHER', 'author', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'great', 'power', 'feeling', 'had', 'original', 'GODFATHER', 'movies', 'Gordon', 'Willis', 'cinematography', 'was', 'magnificent', 'original', 'films', ""n't"", 'half', 'impressive', 'here', 'moments', 'real', 'problem', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'III', 'should', ""n't"", 'exist', 'interesting', 'addition', 'saga', 'was', 'made', 'money', 'not', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'say', 'comparison', 'parts', 'II', 'understatement', 'Still', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'only', 'quell', 'curiousity', 'film', 'ending', 'truly', 'stellar']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

I've come to the conclusion that Godfather II should have been the last Michael Corleone film.  That's because every time I watch it I get chills during those last few moments, a piece of perfect and haunting cinema history.  Somehow those last seconds sum up everything Michael might have had and everything he might have been - they are utterly heartbreaking.  And they are enough.  The message didn't need to be carried into a third film explaining about Michael's regrets - from the end of part 2 we already knew!  Michael has had his brother killed and is emotionally dead, so we don't really need to see his physical death and deterioration in Part 3.So what did I like about Part 3?  Several scenes stick in my mind.  When Vincent killed Joe Zaza there was a flash of Vito / Sonny / Michael from the old days.  When Michael told Kay he'd always loved her and she said it back, I couldn't hold back the tears, although it did feel a little contrived since Kay had remarried and we weren't given a sense of who her new husband was.  The ending was the best bit, symbolic and achingly sad.  Al Pacino's final moments were heartbreaking, as I knew they would be.The performances are generally good, particularly from Al Pacino, although his character unfortunately no longer requires him to use his remarkable quiet voiced anger that he displayed so chillingly in the first two films.  I thought Andy Garcia was only OK as Vincent, his character wasn't really fleshed out enough to be truly compelling.  Talia Shire's character, Connie, seemed to be a completely different woman, and it was strange how Michael suddenly let her sit in on business meetings.  The main problem I had was that Mary, Michael's daughter, and Vincent, did not have any chemistry between them so it was impossible to see how they had fallen in love.  Their romance was unrealistic because they never acted 'in love', there were no intense glances as there were between Apollonia and Michael in Godfather 1, for example.  The whole 'forbidden romance between cousins' plot seemed unneccesary and a bit of a strange choice.  I also would have liked more closure on Michael's first marriage to Apollonia, it wasn't clear if he ever told Kay before or how she found out or how she (or their children) felt about it, they didn't even seem surprised which didn't seem quite right.Overall, the Godfather III is a difficult movie to review.  It isn't a classic like part 1 and 2, but it's not terrible either.  I just question whether it was ever needed in the first place.  Perhaps 'Part 3' should have been left up to our imaginations, with Al Pacino's dark-eyed intensity from the final scenes of Godfather 2 forever etched in our minds.",3,It should have ended with Godfather 2,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,2834,"['do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'several', 'strong', 'points', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'great', 'end', 'Godfather', 'series', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'Godfather', 'II', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'last', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'film', 'time', 'watch', 'get', 'chills', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'piece', 'perfect', 'haunting', 'cinema', 'history', 'Somehow', 'last', 'seconds', 'sum', 'up', 'everything', 'Michael', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'everything', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'utterly', 'heartbreaking', 'are', 'enough', 'message', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'carried', 'third', 'film', 'explaining', 'Michael', 'regrets', 'end', 'part', '2', 'already', 'knew', 'Michael', 'had', 'brother', 'killed', 'emotionally', 'dead', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'see', 'physical', 'death', 'deterioration', 'Part', '3.So', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'Part', '3', 'Several', 'scenes', 'stick', 'mind', 'When', 'Vincent', 'killed', 'Joe', 'Zaza', 'was', 'flash', 'Vito', '/', 'Sonny', '/', 'Michael', 'old', 'days', 'When', 'Michael', 'told', 'Kay', ""'d"", 'always', 'loved', 'said', 'back', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'tears', 'did', 'feel', 'little', 'contrived', 'Kay', 'had', 'remarried', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'sense', 'who', 'new', 'husband', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'best', 'bit', 'symbolic', 'achingly', 'sad', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'final', 'moments', 'were', 'heartbreaking', 'knew', 'would', 'be.The', 'performances', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'particularly', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'character', 'unfortunately', 'no', 'longer', 'use', 'remarkable', 'quiet', 'voiced', 'anger', 'displayed', 'so', 'chillingly', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'thought', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'was', 'only', 'OK', 'Vincent', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'be', 'truly', 'compelling', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'character', 'Connie', 'seemed', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'woman', 'was', 'strange', 'how', 'Michael', 'suddenly', 'let', 'sit', 'business', 'meetings', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'Mary', 'Michael', 'daughter', 'Vincent', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'chemistry', 'was', 'impossible', 'see', 'how', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'romance', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'never', 'acted', ""'in"", 'love', 'were', 'intense', 'glances', 'were', 'Apollonia', 'Michael', 'Godfather', '1', 'example', 'whole', 'romance', 'cousins', 'plot', 'seemed', 'unneccesary', 'bit', 'strange', 'choice', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'closure', 'Michael', 'first', 'marriage', 'Apollonia', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'ever', 'told', 'Kay', 'how', 'found', 'out', 'how', 'children', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'right.Overall', 'Godfather', 'III', 'difficult', 'movie', 'review', ""n't"", 'classic', 'part', '1', '2', 'not', 'terrible', 'either', 'just', 'question', 'was', 'ever', 'needed', 'first', 'place', 'Perhaps', '3', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'up', 'imaginations', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'dark-eyed', 'intensity', 'final', 'scenes', 'Godfather', '2', 'forever', 'etched', 'minds']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

There is another awesome performance from Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, supported superbly by Diane Keaton,Talia Shire , Andy Garcia and Sofia Coppola who plays Michael's beloved daughter Mary. Godfather III is set in 1979 and deals with the declining years of Michael Corleone and his desire to distance himself from his gangster past and to achieve the respectabilty and legitimacy he craves for. This leads him into financial dealings with the Vatican and involves him in a brilliant, but controversial sub-plot concerning a web of corruption and murder within the Roman Catholic hierarchy. However it is family, tradition, revenge , love and power which are the main themes of the film. Michael's desire to mend fences with ex wife Kay and his relationship with his two children are superbly explored, yet his repemtance and paternal love remain always shadowed by a murderous criminal past that he cannot shake off.

First of all, Talia Shire as the sister proved  just as vicious (but not as violent) as the male Corleones--the great Andy  Garcia as Sonny's illegitimate son--the needed muscle when the Corleones  seem to go soft when they try to get legitimate--turns out a great  performance. Did you miss that Michael just did not want to be legitimate,  he wanted to essentially take over the world? Even if it meant buying off  and/or getting rid of the Vatican? That's pretty powerful stuff. And he  would have done so, it if wasn't for the night of his son's Sicilian opera  debut... The scene of an aged Michael (who looked almost exactly like the  older Vito) dying alone in his chair speaks volumes, too.Friends,  friends, friends--this is a great movie...the overall pacing, the acting,  the cinematography, the dialog, the story, the colors make this a great,  though imperfect, film which only improves with repeat viewing. To me, it  is more than a worthy sequel.",5,"Not a Masterpiece like 1 or 2, but Fine Cinema Nonetheless..",963187200,"07 10, 2000",2000,1208,"['take', 'stance', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'did', 'not', 'ruin', 'film', 'One', 'actor', 'not', 'make', 'break', 'film', 'GF', 'III', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'je', 'ne', 'sais', 'qua', 'be', 'characterised', 'masterpiece', 'first', 'two', 'GFs', 'were', 'still', 'excellent', 'movie', 'First', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'sister', 'proved', 'just', 'as', 'vicious', 'not', 'violent', 'male', 'Corleones', 'great', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Sonny', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'needed', 'muscle', 'when', 'Corleones', 'seem', 'go', 'soft', 'when', 'try', 'get', 'legitimate', 'out', 'great', 'performance', 'Did', 'miss', 'Michael', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'legitimate', 'wanted', 'essentially', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'Even', 'meant', 'buying', 'off', 'and/or', 'getting', 'rid', 'Vatican', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'night', 'son', 'Sicilian', 'opera', 'debut', 'scene', 'aged', 'Michael', 'who', 'looked', 'almost', 'exactly', 'older', 'Vito', 'dying', 'alone', 'chair', 'volumes', 'too.Friends', 'friends', 'friends', 'great', 'movie', 'overall', 'pacing', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'dialog', 'story', 'colors', 'make', 'great', 'imperfect', 'film', 'only', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'more', 'worthy', 'sequel']","The Godfather, Part III Final Director's Cut  VHS"

It was just a big money grab for the studio and Francis Ford Coppola. Sofia Coppola and Andy Garcia are bad actors and look lost most of the time. The rest of the cast is good but no Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall)?
