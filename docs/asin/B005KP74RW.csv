1463875,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B005KP74RW,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[6, 6]","As KOL's lead singer Caleb states ""A lot of people were telling our story, but they got it all wrong, so we decided to tell our own story, so people would know the truth."" And that is what this Rock Documentary is all about, a very well presented story & history of the KOL as told by the members themselves, along with Caleb, Nathan, and Jared's Divorced Father & Mother and many of their relatives. It also includes input from KOL band member Matthew, who is a 1st Cousin to the 3 brothers. All 4 members of the KOL bear the same last name of Followill. This ""Rock Doc"" begans at a Followill Family Reunion in their hometown of Talihina, Oklahoma, which is located in rural Southeastern Oklahoma, in a county that intersects with the Arkansas border. Talihina is a American Choctaw Indian name for ""Iron Road""In this ""Rock Doc"" Caleb covers the process they went through in selecting a name for their band. Then Caleb clearly states that their name ""Kings of Leon"", was chosen in honor of all the band members' Granddad, Leon Mitchell Followill. Their Granddad & Grandma, Leon Mitchell Followill & Mildred Ledell Brown Followill are both in this ""Rock Doc"". They reside in the KOL's hometown of Talihina, Oklahoma.The KOL were raised in a strict, Southern Pentecostal background, the 3 members whose father was a Pentecostal Evangelist Preacher, traveled throughout the Mid South, conducting revivals at Pentecostal Churhes. I was raised in a strict Southern Penetecostal background myself, so I can definitely relate to what they went through while growing up. Legendary Louisiana Rocker Jerry Lee Lewis was also raised in this type of environment to a certain extent. One of my uncles was a Pentecostal Preacher. It's a very stressful job, people call you 24 hours a day/7 days a week. So, I can understand how their father ""burned out"" and ""fell from his ministry"" as a Pentecostal evangelist preacher. I have a lot of respect for their father. He very candidly states in this ""Rock Doc"", that he hit the bottom, and begin drinking heavily, to escape from the pain he was experiencing from his ""burn-out"" and ""fall"". He goes on to state that ""when you hit the bottom, you do what you have to do"". Also, I respect him because he states that ""when he was a traveling  Pentecostal Evangelist Preacher, he never begged for money, because he didn't like to see other Preachers begging for money"". So, they just made whatever amount of money the churches were willing to give them, which resulted in them living basically in poverty. It covers the story of how the KOL's strict Southern Pentecostal background eventually transformed them into becoming one of the biggest Rock bands in the world. The ""fall"" of their Pentecostal Evangelist Father, Ivan Leon Followill lead to the divorce between the 3 brothers' mother (Betty Ann) & their father (Ivan Leon).This ""Rock Doc"" contains a lot of candid, intimate home video's of the boys growing up. These videos includes church videos and show the boys' singing gospel songs at church. It also contains home video's of the boys and family members growing up in Southeastern Oklahoma. It includes home & professional videos including commentaries from their divorced mother & father, and many many commentaries & videos from their many relatives. It shows the rural environment where they grew up in, bacisally in Talihina, Oklahoma. It shows them playing in a creek that was one of their main fun spots, while growing up.Overall, their divorced mother & father, along with their many relatives seem to be ""acccepting"" and very proud of them, for their success in the World of Rock & Roll.This is a very interesting ""Rock Doc"" to watch. The dvd package includes a ""family tree"" of the Followill Family. Also, the dvd has an approximate running time of 135 minutes, according to the back of the dvd case, which is longer that what the Amazon Product Description states. It contains ""Special Features"" including deleted scenes, home movies, & additional commentaries. If you like the Kings of Leon, you'll love this history & story of the band members. At the very end during the ""credits"" portion of the dvd, the song ""Radioactive"" is played as background music. It fits in just perfect, especially with the lyrics ""When the role is called up Yonder, I hope you'll see me there....It's in the water, where you came from...."". And this dvd shows you exactly where they came from.",5,"A Very Candid, Intimate, ""Rock Doc"" as Told By The Kings of Leon Themselves, Along with Their Father, Mother, & Relatives.",1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,4421,"['KOL', 'lead', 'singer', 'Caleb', 'A', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'telling', 'story', 'got', 'wrong', 'decided', 'tell', 'own', 'story', 'people', 'would', 'know', 'truth', 'what', 'Rock', 'Documentary', 'about', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'story', 'history', 'KOL', 'told', 'members', 'Caleb', 'Nathan', 'Jared', 'Divorced', 'Father', 'Mother', 'many', 'relatives', 'also', 'input', 'KOL', 'band', 'member', 'Matthew', 'who', '1st', 'Cousin', '3', 'brothers', '4', 'members', 'KOL', 'bear', 'same', 'last', 'name', 'Followill', 'Rock', 'Doc', 'begans', 'Followill', 'Family', 'Reunion', 'hometown', 'Talihina', 'Oklahoma', 'located', 'rural', 'Southeastern', 'Oklahoma', 'county', 'Arkansas', 'border', 'Talihina', 'American', 'Choctaw', 'Indian', 'name', 'Iron', 'Road', 'Rock', 'Doc', 'Caleb', 'process', 'went', 'selecting', 'name', 'band', 'Then', 'Caleb', 'clearly', 'name', 'Kings', 'Leon', 'was', 'chosen', 'honor', 'band', 'members', 'Granddad', 'Leon', 'Mitchell', 'Followill', 'Their', 'Granddad', 'Grandma', 'Leon', 'Mitchell', 'Followill', 'Mildred', 'Ledell', 'Brown', 'Followill', 'are', 'Rock', 'Doc', 'reside', 'KOL', 'hometown', 'Talihina', 'Oklahoma.The', 'KOL', 'were', 'raised', 'strict', 'Southern', 'Pentecostal', 'background', '3', 'members', 'father', 'was', 'Pentecostal', 'Evangelist', 'Preacher', 'traveled', 'Mid', 'South', 'conducting', 'revivals', 'Pentecostal', 'Churhes', 'was', 'raised', 'strict', 'Southern', 'Penetecostal', 'background', 'can', 'definitely', 'relate', 'what', 'went', 'growing', 'up', 'Legendary', 'Louisiana', 'Rocker', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'was', 'also', 'raised', 'type', 'environment', 'certain', 'extent', 'One', 'uncles', 'was', 'Pentecostal', 'Preacher', 'very', 'stressful', 'job', 'people', 'call', '24', 'hours', 'day/7', 'days', 'week', 'So', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'father', 'burned', 'out', 'fell', 'ministry', 'Pentecostal', 'evangelist', 'preacher', 'have', 'lot', 'respect', 'father', 'very', 'candidly', 'Rock', 'Doc', 'hit', 'bottom', 'begin', 'drinking', 'heavily', 'escape', 'pain', 'was', 'experiencing', 'burn-out', 'fall', 'state', 'when', 'hit', 'bottom', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'Also', 'respect', 'when', 'was', 'traveling', 'Pentecostal', 'Evangelist', 'Preacher', 'never', 'begged', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'other', 'Preachers', 'begging', 'money', 'So', 'just', 'made', 'amount', 'money', 'churches', 'were', 'willing', 'give', 'resulted', 'living', 'basically', 'poverty', 'story', 'how', 'KOL', 'strict', 'Southern', 'Pentecostal', 'background', 'eventually', 'transformed', 'becoming', 'one', 'biggest', 'Rock', 'bands', 'world', 'fall', 'Pentecostal', 'Evangelist', 'Father', 'Ivan', 'Leon', 'Followill', 'lead', 'divorce', '3', 'brothers', 'mother', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'father', 'Ivan', 'Leon', '.This', 'Rock', 'Doc', 'lot', 'candid', 'intimate', 'home', 'video', 'boys', 'growing', 'up', 'videos', 'church', 'videos', 'show', 'boys', 'singing', 'gospel', 'songs', 'church', 'also', 'home', 'video', 'boys', 'family', 'members', 'growing', 'up', 'Southeastern', 'Oklahoma', 'home', 'professional', 'videos', 'including', 'commentaries', 'divorced', 'mother', 'father', 'many', 'many', 'commentaries', 'videos', 'many', 'relatives', 'rural', 'environment', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'bacisally', 'Talihina', 'Oklahoma', 'playing', 'creek', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'fun', 'spots', 'growing', 'up.Overall', 'divorced', 'mother', 'father', 'many', 'relatives', 'seem', 'be', 'acccepting', 'very', 'proud', 'success', 'World', 'Rock', 'Roll.This', 'very', 'interesting', 'Rock', 'Doc', 'watch', 'dvd', 'package', 'family', 'tree', 'Followill', 'Family', 'Also', 'dvd', 'approximate', 'running', 'time', '135', 'minutes', 'according', 'back', 'dvd', 'case', 'longer', 'what', 'Amazon', 'Product', 'Description', 'states', 'Special', 'Features', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'home', 'movies', 'additional', 'commentaries', 'like', 'Kings', 'Leon', ""'ll"", 'love', 'history', 'story', 'band', 'members', 'very', 'end', 'credits', 'portion', 'dvd', 'song', 'Radioactive', 'played', 'background', 'music', 'just', 'perfect', 'especially', 'lyrics', 'When', 'role', 'called', 'up', 'Yonder', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'see', '.It', 'water', 'where', 'came', 'dvd', 'exactly', 'where', 'came']",Talihina Sky: The Story Of Kings Of Leon

1463878,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005KP74RW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[39, 40]","When I look at a rock documentary these days, I always wonder how much appeal the movie would have outside a performer or group's regular fan base.  Kings of Leon are certainly a talented quartet that have taken the music scene by storm and I definitely think that this inside portrait will appeal to their fan base.  A truthful, if somewhat episodic, document of the group's success and back story--Stephen C. Mitchell's ""Talihina Sky: The Story of Kings of Leon"" has a warts-and-all appeal that makes for interesting storytelling.  The group has a candor and openness in front of the camera that involves the viewer as a part of the action.  But the focus of the movie kind of jumps around with no specific narrative purpose.  I still thought this was a vital and alive piece that offers quite a bit of insight into Kings of Leon and the roots that made them who they are today.  I don't know if it will necessarily garner new fans--their music, while featured, isn't necessarily a focal point--but it has a satisfying fly-on-the-wall feel for those wishing to understand the boys more personally.If you are shopping this title, you undoubtedly already know that Kings of Leon is comprised of three Followill brothers (Nathan, Caleb, and Jared) with their cousin (Matthew).  While the brothers grew up in a strict Pentecostal upbringing following their preacher father around the country, the main part of their clan resided in rural Oklahoma.  The documentary spends almost as much time with the Followill's extended family as it does with the principle group and it's an intriguing approach.  The family is dirt poor and still live a meager lifestyle at the outskirts of Oklahoma City.  While colorful and wildly eccentric, the film treats these individuals with respect (unlike other filmic representations where they would be looked upon in derision).  This poor upbringing, along with the religion and their father's perceived betrayal, affected the boys in their formative years creating a rebelliousness essential to their music.The film intercuts these family sequences and interviews with Kings of Leon on the road.  The boys are thouroughly surprised by their commercial success as they seem to exhibit much contempt for what plays on contemporary radio.  The film doesn't shy away from some of the unpleasantness inherent in the lifestyle--the drinking, drugs, squabbles, and ego trips--and the experience is more powerful because of it.  The most memorable sequences in the movie are scenes of rock and roll excess juxtaposed with religious mania and iconography.  Again, I don't know that ""Talihina Sky"" will stand as the comprehensive or definitive portrait of Kings of Leon, but it does have an immediacy and intimacy that their fans should eat up.  Beware, though, these are real guys.  This is no processed Hollywood product and their portrayal is not always flattering.

1463879,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B005KP74RW,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 3]","From their dominant religious upbringing to their rebellious and brilliant rise to the top, Kings Of Leon truly are a sight to see.  Named after their paternal grandfather Leon, of whom they are 'Kings Of', they are performing as one of the most celebrated bands of late.Talihina Sky tells the intricate and enticing story of the Followill band of brothers (Nathan, Caleb and Jared--all their middle names) along with first cousin Matthew Followill who also joined in.  This documentary is done in such an appealing way, I have watched it several times already, catching onto something new with each viewing.Beginning this rich tale is to start with the boy's impoverished, zealously Pentacostal childhood.  Their side of the family was strict: devout although favorably balanced through their mother Betty Ann. Their father Ivan, being an evangelical preacher who led revival meetings that the boys were always attending gradually turned to alcohol.  Ivan and Betty Ann were divorced while the boys were in their latter teen years. He comments throughout the film as does she.We see this come into view back and forth as the documentary plays through with plenty of interesting narrative and dialog from a huge family.  They are at their annual family reunion including an abundance of relatives in a very rural Talihina OK. locale where all sorts of people are gathered.  This certainly is an interesting documented family portrait.They have many many uncles, cousins, etc. who all join in and make this yearly occasion quite a shindig for days. There are little shacks all over the property, animals and a creek that their grandmother named ""the best babysitter in the world"". Nathan, Caleb, Jared and Matthew come without any pretense and without an attitude of any superiority.  They don't even bring an instrument, only themselves and a spirit of fun as they look forward to this all year long.The time spent there brings away with it heavy reflection of being brought up ""poor"" and having only two pairs of pants trading between Caleb and Nathan to wear to school.  Caleb talks on this subject from time to time and about the ""shame"" he felt before starting the band.  He always wanted a better life for his own family some day and has now found the opportunity to achieve it.Their very country family hosts a cast of characters that easily makes this film more enjoyable to watch repeatedly.  Set to Kings Of Leon's family musings in the background, you really couldn't wish for a more atmospheric place to be. That family reunion, where everyone is just a 'plain ole' me' looks like a great amount of fun to attend.  Yes, an  excess of some things of the whole rock and roll life, although that is seen everywhere not just here in these families.Along with the familial story itself are the paralleled packed stadiums that the band is performing in.  Lots of backstage antics, much expected rebellion from the Followills and song after song in their writing and performing stages. The documentary has a definite personal stamp right on it and plays to people who are either fans or not, it's just that well done.  This band is tight, cohesive but first and foremost: This band is family.",5,"""....Once The Show Gets Started It's Bound To Be A Sight To See"" - Pyro  (Kings Of Leon)",1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,3196,"['dominant', 'religious', 'upbringing', 'rebellious', 'brilliant', 'rise', 'top', 'Kings', 'Leon', 'are', 'sight', 'see', 'Named', 'paternal', 'grandfather', 'Leon', 'whom', 'are', ""'Kings"", 'are', 'performing', 'one', 'most', 'celebrated', 'bands', 'late.Talihina', 'Sky', 'intricate', 'enticing', 'story', 'Followill', 'band', 'brothers', 'Nathan', 'Caleb', 'Jared', 'middle', 'names', 'first', 'cousin', 'Matthew', 'Followill', 'who', 'also', 'joined', 'documentary', 'done', 'such', 'appealing', 'way', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'already', 'catching', 'something', 'new', 'viewing.Beginning', 'rich', 'tale', 'start', 'boy', 'impoverished', 'zealously', 'Pentacostal', 'childhood', 'side', 'family', 'was', 'strict', 'devout', 'favorably', 'balanced', 'mother', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'father', 'Ivan', 'being', 'evangelical', 'preacher', 'who', 'led', 'revival', 'meetings', 'boys', 'were', 'always', 'attending', 'gradually', 'turned', 'alcohol', 'Ivan', 'Betty', 'Ann', 'were', 'divorced', 'boys', 'were', 'latter', 'years', 'comments', 'film', 'she.We', 'see', 'come', 'view', 'back', 'forth', 'documentary', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'narrative', 'dialog', 'huge', 'family', 'are', 'annual', 'family', 'reunion', 'including', 'abundance', 'relatives', 'very', 'rural', 'Talihina', 'OK.', 'locale', 'where', 'sorts', 'people', 'are', 'gathered', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'documented', 'family', 'portrait.They', 'have', 'many', 'many', 'uncles', 'cousins', 'etc', 'who', 'join', 'make', 'yearly', 'occasion', 'quite', 'shindig', 'days', 'are', 'little', 'shacks', 'property', 'animals', 'creek', 'grandmother', 'named', 'best', 'babysitter', 'world', 'Nathan', 'Caleb', 'Jared', 'Matthew', 'come', 'pretense', 'attitude', 'superiority', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bring', 'instrument', 'only', 'spirit', 'fun', 'look', 'forward', 'year', 'long.The', 'time', 'spent', 'away', 'heavy', 'reflection', 'being', 'brought', 'up', 'poor', 'having', 'only', 'two', 'pairs', 'pants', 'trading', 'Caleb', 'Nathan', 'wear', 'school', 'Caleb', 'talks', 'subject', 'time', 'time', 'shame', 'felt', 'starting', 'band', 'always', 'wanted', 'better', 'life', 'own', 'family', 'day', 'now', 'found', 'opportunity', 'achieve', 'it.Their', 'very', 'country', 'family', 'cast', 'characters', 'easily', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'Set', 'Kings', 'Leon', 'family', 'musings', 'background', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'wish', 'more', 'atmospheric', 'place', 'be', 'family', 'reunion', 'where', 'everyone', 'just', ""'plain"", 'ole', 'looks', 'great', 'amount', 'fun', 'attend', 'Yes', 'excess', 'things', 'whole', 'rock', 'roll', 'life', 'seen', 'everywhere', 'not', 'just', 'here', 'families.Along', 'familial', 'story', 'are', 'paralleled', 'packed', 'stadiums', 'band', 'performing', 'Lots', 'backstage', 'antics', 'much', 'expected', 'rebellion', 'Followills', 'song', 'song', 'writing', 'performing', 'stages', 'documentary', 'definite', 'personal', 'stamp', 'right', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'not', 'just', 'that', 'well', 'done', 'band', 'tight', 'cohesive', 'first', 'foremost', 'band', 'family']",Talihina Sky: The Story Of Kings Of Leon
