They are among the best performers these days.  So, even if I hadn't read the books, I would have probably enjoyed this movie.  But I did read the books, and I thought that this was a very faithful adaptation.  Sure, a purest might quibble with a few plot changes, but they worked quite well.The storyline involves a teenager who becomes a vampire's assistant.  He is a really decent kid, and we follow him as he learns about the world of vampires and ""freaks.""  In many ways, the book is actually rather compassionate.  I liked the treatment of the ""freaks.""What I particularly liked about the movie was the way the world of the cirque was presented.  I loved the sets, the costumes, the intelligent design in everything.  Finally, while I loved the performance of the stars, I was amazed at all the fine talent in the support cast.  Orlando Jones, as the thin man, is fun, for example.  And I found the depiction of the snake boy very touching.  I thought Mr. Tiny was wonderfully done, along with the ""bad guys.""  I think the performer that played Steve was very, very excellent.So, I understand this didn't do so great at the box office.  If that is true, it is a shame.

It tells the boring story of a young man who makes a pact with an old vampire named Crepsley (John C. Reilly). He does this because he feels responsible for putting his best friend Steve in jeapordy. In this world, vampires do not kill to feed unless you are a vampaneze. Vampaneze? At first I thought this was a vampie of asian descent, but I was wrong. They are just skeevy vampires with bad attitudes. Steve is upset that his best friend stole his dream of being a vampire and winds up going to the vampaneze. Do you care yet? I don't! The two best friends now find themselves on opposite sides of an age-old war, which means there is more crap to come.This movie fails on a few levels. The story is good enough to make you watch to the end, yet is predictable. The acting is shoddy and the casting is terrible. I didn't know if this was a comedy or a serious horror movie. Reilly is an excellent actor and does a good job, but I'm looking at him and all I can see is Step Brothers and Talladega Nights! The 2 young actors are horrible and convey nothing in their performances. This makes Twilight look like a great vampire flick (and it's not)! If you like vampire movies I suggest ""30 Days of Night"" or the Underworld trilogy.MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Beautiful picture and sound.

1293351,A5EKUC02QJKWE,B002VJJMT8,"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[1, 2]","I just finished watching this film--luckily--before buying it. I will say this, the movie does have its pros as well as its cons, but I feel that the cons outweigh the pros. For any hardcore fantasy film lover like me, I would recommend you see this movie before buying it. I, personally, felt it was worth seeing at least once. Let me make a list of the pros and cons without giving too much away:Pros: The film has a really good soundtrack. The music is very mysterious and dark, giving this hollow tale a bit more dimension. The beginning credits were animated and very well-sylized, and sets the audience up for a good ride, which, unfortunately, never takes off (the animation combined with the music gave me the same feeling I got when seeing the end credits for A Series of Unfortunate Events--If you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about). Some of the film's visuals were also quite impressive, such as some of the long shots of the campground where the freaks live. Another positive aspect of this film is the casting of John C. Reilly as the vampire Larten Crepsley. When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought he looked a bit miscast, but I was very wrong. He was probably the saving grace of this movie and was the only character keeping the plot afloat. He plays his role with just the right amount of wit, charm, and sympathy; I wish he would have been used more, since he was the only seemingly three-dimensional character in the film. The special-effects were also well-done (except for the speed-racing colors they used on the vampires when they run at the speed of light), especially when the freaks are showcasing their abilities or deformities.Cons: I felt there were too many for me to thoroughly enjoy this film. For one thing, I think everyone else, minus John C. Reilly, was miscast. Then again, I have not read the books on which this movie is based, but I have friends who are quite fond of the books and feel that the darkness, the foreboding, and the melancholy from the story, were not translated well onscreen. I would have to agree. I have passed by the covers of the books in my nearest bookstore, and I felt the cover art revealed a darkness and severity that lacked in this film adaptation. The directing is a little off when it comes to the characters. For one thing, the protagonist is as dull as a plank of wood (his animated counterpart in the beginning credits was more entertaining and convincing; they did him too much justice). He delivers his lines so unconvincingly that we, the audience, wonder if he cares about anything or anyone. His parents, on the other hand, seem too lively and caricatures of real parents. When they find out **spoiler** he dies, their faces show no signs of mourning or regret, or doubt **spoiler end**. They were caricatures while they're son was anything but that. In that sense, the film felt unstable. If it were left up to me, I would have cast either a better protagonist and antagonist, or I would have decided to stray from the book and cast college-age young adults to play them with better acting skills. That way, the stakes would seem more important, and, overall, severe. I am a big fan of a realistic approach to fantasy work, as can be seen in some of the latest Harry Potter films. It makes the world real to the audience, and gets them more involved. Sadly, this film did not achieve that. My guess is that the director wanted to make the protagonist and antagonist seem like real teens by making them use the word ""man"" and ""like"" every other sentence, but it only made them seem a little dumb and incapable of pursuing their intricate destinies. In fact, in trying to make them seem real, they came across as rather lame and empty-headed. I actually feel, however, that Josh Hutcherson did a better acting job than the main guy; but then again, he's had more acting experience and has showcased better acting skills in prior films.Maybe I'm not one to give a valid opinion on this film since I have not read the books and, therefore, cannot compare. However, I do judge this movie as a fantasy film lover who wishes justice would be made to outstanding and iconic works of fiction. I feel filmmakers are at a constant rush to cough out the next big hit, that they forget to make a solid, worthwhile film. Yes, people will pay to see it, but they will not stand the test of time, unfortunately. While watching this movie, I felt myself reworking the tone and plot in my head to make a better film. In my head, I created a masterpiece, but I could not say the same for the crap I was watching onscreen. If they do decide to continue with the Cirque du Freak series, which I strongly hope they do, I hope a new director takes hold of it and truly understands the appeal of this story, which can really be a classic, but only if approached with the right mindset. Instead of watering it down, I say the filmmakers take a chance and make something truly dark, foreboding, and severe.",2,"This is an okay movie, but it is worth viewing at least once.",1268611200,"03

It sported a good cast and seemed to have quite a bit of flair. I was right on both counts but unfortunately that was about all it had. Truth be told this film is a bit of a mess.There are a couple of things going on in the story but none are well resolved. You have the good and bad kid who are somehow best buds and their friendship is tested. You have a very freaky circus coming into town that is owned by a vampire. Now it turns out there is another strain of vampire known as a vampinese . The two factions are at odds with one another and war between the two is getting closer. It seems there is another ghoulish denizen of the darkness that is trying to make said war happen.Part of the problem is the casting. I like John C. Reilly but he is mis-cast as the vampire kingpin. He doesn't have the necessary presence and his voice has no authority. I also like Willem Dafoe but his character barely exists. He's in a couple of scenes giving advice but nothing comes of it or him. What's not to like about Salma Hayek, but like Dafoe her character seems to serve no real purpose. She has strong psychic tremors when she's around Chris Massoglia's character but we don't really get what makes him so different and dangerous. (Unless it's the fact he refuses to take blood). Orlando Bloom is here and he's likable enough but he's just one of the freaks. He has no integral relationship to the story. Now....what about the war. We don't see the vampinese or their army so there is no real sense of threat. What about the ghoul dude and his henchmen trying to broker the war with the use of the Massoglia character? What does he gain in seeing this war happen? Too many loose ends for me.It is a trait for a lot of films to resolve but also leave that little door open at the end in case it becomes a surprise hit and a sequel can turn more profit. But here, very little is resolved and the door is left so wide open you could run a 747 through it.There is a lot of fun and inventiveness here and it it passes the time well enough but the script needed to be a whole lot tighter.

Whenever you get into the PG-13 world you are going to get a much more friendly and watered down film with less brutality, violence and language. Reality and financing dictates that the movie studios have to appeal to a broader audience when possible to make enough money to allow the films I mentioned previously.I am not familiar with the book that this movie is based upon. That being said this was a fun 'teen oriented' vampire movie with no significant violence or gore. This is a PG-13 (unfortunately) flick; you know it's going to be in the vanilla spectrum so don't expect Blade or Underworld. The CGI animation and coloring of John C. Reilly's pet spider was amazing, but then again any quality CGI animation done nowadays should be and usually is amazing. The makeup effects, set design and costumes were well done and give the movie an interesting modern Gothic appearance and feel.The characters were interesting and I found myself pretty involved in the story. Comparing this film to the wildly successful Twilight films, the two out so far any ways, Cirque is much more interesting. There are no moping or perfect looking Twilight characters and Cirque was just more interesting than both Twilight 1 and 2. I love John C. Reilly and vampire movies so this was my primary motivation for seeing this in the theater. Reilly's character was not in his usual comedic or musical roles so it was good to see him do something completely different. Willem Defoe has a smaller role in this film and plays a very interesting vampire character as well.All in all this movie is worth seeing and if you are a genre fan it is probably worth owning.",4,A fun teenage vampire flick...,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,1833,"['will', 'preface', 'review', 'movie', 'saying', 'much', 'prefer', 'Blade', 'From', 'Dusk', 'til', 'Dawn', 'Underworld', 'type', 'vampire', 'flicks', 'have', 'tons', 'action', 'violence', 'gore', 'Whenever', 'get', 'PG-13', 'world', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'friendly', 'watered', 'down', 'film', 'less', 'brutality', 'violence', 'language', 'Reality', 'financing', 'dictates', 'movie', 'studios', 'have', 'appeal', 'broader', 'audience', 'when', 'possible', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'allow', 'films', 'mentioned', 'previously.I', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'fun', 'oriented', 'vampire', 'movie', 'significant', 'violence', 'gore', 'PG-13', 'unfortunately', 'flick', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'vanilla', 'spectrum', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Blade', 'Underworld', 'CGI', 'animation', 'coloring', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'pet', 'spider', 'was', 'amazing', 'then', 'again', 'quality', 'CGI', 'animation', 'done', 'nowadays', 'should', 'be', 'usually', 'amazing', 'makeup', 'effects', 'set', 'design', 'costumes', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'give', 'movie', 'interesting', 'modern', 'Gothic', 'appearance', 'feel.The', 'characters', 'were', 'interesting', 'found', 'pretty', 'involved', 'story', 'Comparing', 'film', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Twilight', 'films', 'two', 'so', 'far', 'ways', 'Cirque', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'are', 'moping', 'perfect', 'looking', 'Twilight', 'characters', 'Cirque', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'interesting', 'Twilight', '1', '2', 'love', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'vampire', 'movies', 'was', 'primary', 'motivation', 'seeing', 'theater', 'Reilly', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'usual', 'comedic', 'musical', 'roles', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'do', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'smaller', 'role', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'vampire', 'character', 'well.All', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'are', 'genre', 'fan', 'probably', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A

1293385,A2XXP3CYVM28MG,B002VJJMT8,"K. pratt ""The Soul of Darkness""","[0, 1]","I haven't read the books that this movie is based on but I wouldn't be surprised if this film fails to convey the spirit, mood and atmosphere of the written word.  This movie falls just a little bit flat.The protagonist is a teen named Darren, played by the very pleasant Chris Massoglia.  Through a series of fairly freaky events, he becomes the half-vampire assistant of a vampire circus leader portrayed by John C. Reilly.  Everybody knows that Reilly is an outstanding actor, but my impression is that he never felt comfortable attempting to breathe life into this role and I have to assume that his casting was a mistake.  Reilly never succeeds in being menacing or in being comical.  He seems rather lost.Another bit of poor casting comes with the young actor who plays Steve, Darren's best friend who ultimately transforms into a nemesis for the teen.  I've seen this actor in other movies, and he always comes across as sullen and smirky and dull.  His limitations as an actor do great harm to the film as a whole because his character should have been quite potent and exciting.Salma Hayek and Willem Dafoe have very small parts in this film and their appearances are essentially merely cameos.  But each actor is fun to watch and so their brief time on screen does enhance the enjoyability of the movie.  Of course, it would have been nice if they had been given more to do.All of these negative factors are balanced by the rich, colorful, weird visual appeal of the film.  Although the film portrays a circus of freaks, the freakish stuff never descends into true ugliness.  Young teens should be fairly comfortable viewing what transpires before them on the screen.  The grotesqueries that this film offers will probably be very appealing to male teens, especially.  They may groove on it quite a bit.Chris Massoglia does a good job in the lead and it is fun to follow his weird adventures for the entire length of the film.  The film has definite flaws and it isn't nearly as entertaining as it should have been, but there really aren't any slow spots and there are always garish images to feast upon.

Each of the two teens finds himself recruited to one side. Darren is our good guy, becoming assistant to the vampire Crepsley and moving in with the Cirque Du Freaks, and also forming a relationship with a very cute girl who just happens to have a monkey tail. Steve, on the other hand, is taken in by the mysterious and clearly evil Mr. Tiny, who plans to use him to kickoff a vampire apocalypse.There's no mistaking when watching ""Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" that it was one of many attempts to imitate the successful Harry Potter franchise by selecting a young readers' book series and making a big budget movie about it. Though these films/stories can be rather formulaic, they also can be entertaining (and always have at least one gorgeous, upcoming starlet). So, it's a bit sad that they rarely have success in kicking off their intended franchises. Percy Jackson is another great example, though that one seemed more of a Potter copycat attempt than this one (keep in mind that I'm basing this on the films, not the books, as I haven't read any of them). While I still found Percy Jackson entertaining, especially Alexandra Daddario, Vampire's Assistant is a far better film/story. Yeah, it's aimed at a young audience, and that is pretty clear at times, but it's also got some humor and general situations that are a bit more adult, which was surprising, and then there's John C. Reilly, who is constantly amazing me. Of course, you've also got some characters and some actors here who are a bit less likable. Salma Hayek, for example, still can't act, and seeing her grow a beard is so nausea inducing. And, Josh Hutcherson is at his least likable. I guess he is supposed to be, though. Oh, by the way, Willem Dafoe was in this! That was a surprise. I guess they really were trying to make this the American Harry Potter here. Again, a shame it didn't hit. I found this film to be lots of fun, never a dull moment,  and I LOVED Jessica Carlson's ADORABLE monkey girl, Rebecca. I could totally learn to love her tail. Oh, I do have to comment on the film's werewolf though. Very offensive. Not so much the ugly werewolf design they used, but the fact that he was depicted as just a circus animal, like an old lion or something. No human side to him at all.The Blu-Ray has a lot of deleted scenes, which are very cool. It also has some good ""Making Of"" featurette material, and there's a virtual tour of the circus's camp grounds that introduces some of the characters. I didn't find any trailers or commentary or anything though, so that's a bit lame. Still, this Blu is generally going for a really nice price lately, so not much to complain about, really. I highly recommend it if you find you enjoy these kinds of films. Even though the sequels will probably never be made, it is still entertaining and worth watching on its own. It will leave you wanting more, but it tells its first story completely enough.

But deep down inside, he's not ready for the College-Marriage-Family scenario his parents are preparing him for.He likes spiders and imagines werewolves.  His best friend, Steve, (Josh Hutcherson) convinces him to cut class for the first time.  Then, to attend a freak show.Big surprise, these freak are real.One particular freak, red-haired Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly) has the most beautiful and deadly spider that Darren's ever seen. If asked, he couldn't tell you why he stole the highly poisonous Madame Octa, but the consequences force him to become a half-vampire and become Crepsley's servant to save his family and his friends. Unwittingly, he steps in the middle of a war between two differently evolved species of vampires.The film's suitable for an audience of 9 or above.  Some gross and dark elements, but about on the level a young adult story.  Arachnophobes will probably only be uncomfortable when a real spider is depicted.The situation just gets odder from here. The film is directed by Paul Weitz, working for the first time without his brother, Chris, and is based on the Little Brown Books for Young Readers series by the same name written by Darren Shan.

1293400,ABFQUOV57SWOR,B002VJJMT8,robb1138,"[1, 1]","If you are planning to see any vampire film this spring, I think you should see the ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant .""  The movie is enchanting, entertaining, and visually stunning.  Based on the Cirque du Freak books by Darren Shan, the movie seems to encompass the first two books of the series.  Suspending reality for this movie is effortless with the help of John C. Riley as Larten Crepsley a 200 hundred year old vampire and a main attraction (along with Madam Octa) at the Cirque.  This fun movie, set in an anonymous town, tells the story of two high school boys representing two opposing forces finding themselves entrapped in the world of vampires, freaks, and the walking, talking dead.Darren Shan, a straight ""A"" student at Beckham High School, and his best friend Steve, from the wrong side of the tracks, have been friends since at least second grade, find them invited to Cirque du Freak as it passes through town.  The boys, admonished not to go by their chalkboard scraping history teacher,Mr. Kersey, the boys go.  Both boys have a secret passion for the perverse.  Darren's, as he explains in a voice over, that spiders captivate him, while Steve, played by Josh Hutcherson, his best friend is fascinated by vampires.  During the freak-show we meet most of the cast, Gavner Purl, (Willem Dafoe looking a lot like a creepy Cesar Romero, during his Joker days), Hibernius Tall (Ken Watanabe), Madam Traska, a bearded lady, (Selma Hayek), Evra Von, the snake man, Rhamus Twobellies, a werewolf and the deceptively large and seemingly evil Mr. Tiny, played by remarkably fit Michael Cerveris.  Mr. Tiny and his henchman Murlough a Vampaneze, approach both boys, trying to recruit them for some evil scheme that he has in the works.  Steve, Darren's best friend, is from a broken home and wants to become a vampire, and interrupts Crepsley  and Gavner while they discuss the state of Vampire verses Vampaneze affairs.  Steve wants to be a vampire, but Crepsley rejects him, stating that he has, ""bad blood.""  All through this film and undoubtedly through out the book series, the author creates his own set of vampire lore.  Steve, rejected meets up with Darren, who stole Madam Octa and wittinessed the rejection scene while hiding in a closet.  At school, the boys get together and inadvertently let Madam Octa loose at school, while trying to catch the spider running amok through the halls, Steve is bitten and falls into a coma.  Darren, in an effort to save Steve's life, trades his life to become a half-vampire and Crepsley's assistant.  Crepsley saves Steve's life and fakes Darren's death, and Darren goes off to live with Crepsley at the Cirque du Freaks winter campground.  The Cirque, a haven for freaks claims neutrality from the two factions of vampires; receives a visit from Mr. Tiny as he requests Darren Shan be turned over to him.  Mr. Tall says he will consider it, setting the stage for the climatic showdown.  Meanwhile, seduced by the dark side and his lust for power, Mr. Tiny recruits Steve to the Vampaneze faction as their future leader.  Like joining a gang, Steve must be initiated and he does so by killing their history teacher, Mr. Kersey.Oddly enough, Paul Weitz director of ""The Vampires Assistant,"" is the brother of Chris Weitz, director of the new ""Twilight"" movie, ""New Moon,"" the other vampire movie out on DVD.  Both movies focus on teenagers falling in love with the vampire lore, however, I find that ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,"" fun, fresh, fast paced, and leaves the audience wanting more.  The casting of character actor John C. Riley in the part of Larten Crepsley was smart and refreshing.  Chris Massoglia plays 17-year-old Darren Shan, (pen name for the author Darren O'Shaughnessy) and I feel he does a superb job portraying Crepsley new assistant.  17-year-old Josh Hutcherson plays Steve, taking on the bad-boy role.  The special effects on this movie help the story progress rather than reveal themselves for their own sake.  Stephen Trask's film score, works well for this movie, creepy yet playful keeps the mood interesting.  I enjoyed Nick Cave's ""Red Right Hand,"" playing while Crepsley digs up Darren out of his untimely grave.Overall, I enjoyed this movie better than the other vampire movie out on DVD and recommend ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,"" for the whole family.  Note the PG-13 rating, but I think its worth watching.",4,"""Life may be meaningless.

1293407,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,B002VJJMT8,Shopper,"[3, 5]","Cirque du Freak is based on the first trilogy of The Saga of Darren Shan, a set of twelve books (four trilogies) by the Irish writer Darren O'Shaughnessy. These teen/young adult oriented novels have a worldwide following and been translated to over 25 languages.Darren is a teen with a charmed life: popular, smart, from an upper class family, he is destined for a productive and orderly life of college-job-family. This order however is disrupted one night, when, after some prodding from his troubled best friend Steve, Darren attends a late night performance of Cirque du Freak. When Darren's actions put Steve's life in danger, a vampire performer from Cirque du Freak is the only one with the power to save the young man. And so, Darren strikes a deal: in exchange for his friend's life, Darren will abandon his family and become the vampire's assistant; a half vampire himself. Unbeknownst to him, a war has been brewing between the two fractions of the vampire world. Both Darren and Steve are destined to be major players in the coming events...Even though, clearly, I am beyond the teen/young adult years, I found the story compelling enough to investigate further. I am pleased to report that most of the film's production values, including CGI, were impeccable. John C. Reilly as the vampire Larten Crepsley was surprisingly convincing. The number of big name actors who made an appearance in the film was astonishing. So, why only two stars? Well, there were two major problems:1) The actors chosen to portray Darren and Steve not only lacked chemistry, but lacked the abilities to emote deep feelings. Consequently, what should have been a dramatic decision to leave his family comes across as nothing more then a minor blip on Darren's schedule. What should have been a complex feud between two friends who go on to become leaders of the opposing vampire fractions, seemed as nothing more then two silly characters bickering at one another.2) Secondly, even though the story was great, the script was poor. Despite the fact that we learned of the events in a chronological order, their lack of clarity was unacceptable.The film ended with many unanswered questions. Counting on audience support, there were three sequences planned, one for each trilogy. I suppose those plans must be on hold at the moment, given the poor turn out at the box office. Shame really.

1293408,A2TUVJMY4CLQPU,B002VJJMT8,SlimJim,"[4, 16]","Let me just say I recently purchased this film thinking it would be funny and fun to watch. I thought that at worst this film would be decent to watch! Boy was I wrong! Where do I even begin on this movie??? All I can say is I knew I had to post this review because I honestly don't want anyone else making the mistake of wasting their hard earned money on this ""freak"" of a movie.Anyone who might actually enjoy the movie (and haven't read the book) this whole review does have some spoilers in it (if you could actually spoil this movie any worse than what it already is).Where to begin.... well....Firstly, this movie had zero plot, I mean if you call that a plot, seriously people all he pretty much does is walk around with ole shake-n-bake and talk about how he isn't going to drink blood or some other vampire stuff. Then it switches over to his friend (has he ever had acting lessons?? I think not) who is bent on being ""evil"" suddenly! I mean does anyone really buy this whole crap as they are watching this movie???Secondly as I breifly mentioned in the previous statement, the acting was completely horrible, I felt like I was watching my local school play on video or something. Although the two main boys were bad, the family had to be the worse! I realize they were a small part, but I mean gosh! I could have got out there and made a more convincing parent!!!! I mean none of the actors were even convincing in his/her emitions or otherwise.Thirdly, this story was not believeible, and yes I know this sounds stupid because it's a vampire movie but it's true. THe way the actors react to horrible situations in this movie, the way the story plays out is so stupid! I mean I hope the book series was completely off from this movie, cuz I would hate to think a story this crazy got published. I understand this is a a vampire story, but still. I mean, firstly, if some guy told me that I had to become a vampire in order to save my friend (when all was needed was the antidote) I'd be like ""what the heck? Are you a freaking nut chase or something? Vampires? If I even believed in vampires, how is me turning into one going to help my friend??"" I mean his whole reaction was not believeible.... Instead he was like I'll do it, as long as you help my friend. I mean really????? Plus, I mean his handler or what ever shake-n-bake is, said you have to fake your death and leave your family forever. and the boy (darren) is like Okay, I guess I have to leave them forever, and he doesn't even shed a tear or put up a real fuss! I mean hello!! If somebody told me I had to do all that I'd be breaking down and have a panic attack!!! I guess ole Darren must really hate his family and friends or some crap... or perhaps, this whole movie just really really SUCKS!!! Then the whole part of how his best friends suddenly hates his guts for no apparent reason. I mean really people??? What the heck is up with this movie?????Fourthly, don't even get me started on how this movie acted like there was going to be some big important battle at the end!!!! This whole movie lead up like it was Darren's destiny to be the good guy on the non-killin side and the steve boy was suppose to be the ""evil"" one for the killing bloodsucking side and they were going to have an all out battle in the end and somehow the vampire world be changed or something. Instead you get all the way to the end and the two main characters pretty much fight like two year olds and then get broken up by this werido dude (that no one knows who the heck he is or why the heck he's doing any of the crap he's doing, whom I might add randomly shows up for no apparent reason.) Then this werid guy turns his dead vampire dude into some shrunken werid creature. Then Darren goes back to the freak camp and lays down in the coffin... the end!!! I mean seriously people!!! WHAT THE HECKKK??? I mean I was expecting something you know that would actually have an effect on it all, instead you are left knowing less after the movie then before you started watching it. I actually thought after the fight scene that there was a good thirty minutes left and we'd be seeing the real show down. This movie was like stopping in mid sentence and then the rest was just left out there hanging somewhere.Fifthly, this movie had way tooo much added stupididy!!!!! I mean really if the bad plot, bad acting, and all the other dissappointments weren't enough to make this one of the suckest movies of all time we had to add all this completely unnessary stupididty!!!! For example, we have this werid woman who's limps regrow if chopped or bitten off, kinda like a skink and its tail regrows. Okay, that's fine, but why do we have to watch some werid sexual scene where she rips her finger off then french kisses with the finger in her lover's mouth. I mean ""EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"" doesn't even cover it. Not to mention the whole crap and extremely fake looking rotten muck thats in the wolfman's cage, and uhhh the werid guck that the shruken people have in their feed tub!!! I'd really like to know the shrunken peoples' purpose, besides bitting at people's hands? I mean really what do these people or the man that calls them his pets really have to do with the movie??? I mean the big guy that rides around in that car makes no sense!!!! I mean you talk about stupid. this guy just shows up outta no where and isn't a vampire, so what business does he have in their business, and talks about destiny all the time and then calls those shrunken people his pets. Which if they are then why the heck are they keeping them at the freak camp??? Because that means they would be knowingly keeping enemies that hear and see everything they do and would be telling their boss/owner??? WOWWWW this movie is so stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just can't believe it!!!Need anymore reasons??? I mean really people do you need any more REASONS!!! I just want to scream thinking about how stupid and awlful this movie was. It most defintley makes the tops in the worse movie of all time!!!!",1,Cirque De Freak was a FREAKING AWLFUL MOVIE!!,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,6025,"['Let', 'just', 'say', 'recently', 'purchased',

Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant  was just not good. Sure, it had a few redeeming moments like some of the vampire special effects and a surprisingly decent cast (John C. Reilly, Salma Hayek,  Ken Watanabe, and Willem Dafoe), but overall it just fell flat for me. It wasn't a comedy, it wasn't a horror, and even though it had a smidgen of romance, I wouldn't quite call it a romance either. It felt like a giant floundering mess that well...sucked, and not in a good way.To recap, two best friends, Darren and Steve, sneak off to see the visiting Cirque du Freak with its very special line-up of freaks, the least of whom are a vampire, a snake-boy, a bearded lady, a monkey chick, and a bunch of some Gollum-looking little creatures reminiscent of the Dinks from Spaceballs. Remember them? One boy has an affinity for vampires, the other spiders. One boy is perfect, the other not so much. Good versus evil set-up? You betcha. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Darren, the spider-loving boy decides to steal a mesmerizing and beautiful spider from the show, only to have it fatally bite his best friend, Steve. To save Steve from certain death, Darren makes a deal with the head of the freak show to become his vampire assistant or a half-vampire. In a very weird manipulation of events by Mr. Tiny (the obscure and overly flamboyant fat bald dude who is supposed to be the epitome of evil), Steve and Darren find themselves pitted against the other, Darren the half-vampire versus Steve the evil vampanese (aka the bad vampires)...which by the way, doesn't even get resolved. See inset, where they are frozen by Mr. Tiny and the fight is postponed for another time. Ahem, enter the sequel(s) at some point (please...say it isn't so!)The movie did have some good moments and funny one-liners which allowed me to get through it without turning the television off so at least that's a good thing.Crepsley to the audience: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. I am so excited to be here in an anonymous small town that used to have character but is now just a bland suburb filled with chain stores and surrounded by slum. It really is a pleasure to be here. And I am SO honored that blah blah blah and so on and so forth and etcetera ad nauseum.The fight scene between Crepsley (vampire) and Murlough (vampanese) in the cemetery was probably the most exciting part, although not a defining moment enough to salvage the whole film. The acting by the lead high-schoolers left me cold, and completely undermined some of the better acting by the more seasoned cast members like Salma Hayek and John C. Reilly, who were both pretty awesome. This film could have been a lot better than it was, which is disappointing since there seem to be so many fans of the book series.  In the end, The Vampire's Assistant just didn't have any fangs whatsoever and offers very little bang for the bite. Instead it turns out to be a bloodless blahness that is embodied by the film's final somewhat clich&eacute;d and unoriginal message - ""it's not about what you are, it's about who you are."" Um, ok thanks.I would rate Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant 1 and a half out of 5 stars.

I was pleasantly disappointed that it isn't. This may be a Young Adult movie but we Older Adults will enjoy it,too. I know I did, so much so, in fact, that I viewed it twice in two days, the second time with my granddaughter. The story treads that fine line between scary and funny, with just enough of each to keep it entertaining. Larten with his fright-wig red hair is a refreshing change from the usual dark foreboding vampire, The dialogue is tongue-in-cheek, the method of becoming a vampire (or a half-vampire) is definitely different. Salma Hayek as a bearded lady in love with Larten and Orlando Jones in the cast add interesting cast characters.

Sixteen-year-old Darren is your typical adolescent; he spends most of his time with his best friend, Steve, earns decent grades, and generally manages to stay out of trouble. But trouble finds Darren when he and Steve make the acquaintance of a vampire named Larten Crepsley while attending a traveling freak show at a local theater. This movie is loosely based on the first trilogy, Vampire Blood. Watching this movie I tried to forget all the things I knew from the books. And yes, this movie experience turned out to be a very enjoyable one. The pace of the movie is pretty good: there's a lot to be told here. There's a lot of humour in it (the books were pretty serious) and the voice-over by Darren Shan works very well. Especially the first 20 minutes (with the actual freakshow) were well done. Ken Watanabe is a great Mr. Tall, the boss of Cirque du Freak. He gives the movie a great mysterious quality.

1293417,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002VJJMT8,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","I tried to like the film. I really did. ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" has many good things in it. This is a slightly dark fantasy world with nice special effects and talented actors such as John C. Reilly, Ray Stevenson and Ken Watanabe. Nothing particularly new, you might say, but still attractive enough. What I really don't understand is the film companies (including Universal) hired Paul Weitz as director. I have nothing against him, but obviously he is not the right choice for the job.The story is about Darren Shan (Chris Massoglia), a young boy living with his perfect family in his perfect community. One day ""Cirque du Freak"" a traveling show with remarkable attractions arrives. It's a spooky night and the red moon is rising. Darren sneaks out of his home and watches the show with his best friend Steve (Josh Hutcherson). However, Darren does one stupid thing there and because of that Steve gets seriously ill. To save his life, Darren meets mysterious Mr. Crepsley (John C. Reilly), who proposes a deal.Like ""The Golden Compass"" (directed by his brother Chris Weitz), Paul Weitz's fantasy film lacks story, character development and imagination. We are told about the warring fractions of vampires. We meet lots of characters - bearded lady Madame Truska (Salma Hayek), Mr. Tall (Ken Watanabe), Evra the Snake Boy (Patrick Fugit) and Rebecca (Jessica Carlson), a cute girl with a tail. OK, I like the cute girl with a tail, but frankly, well-acted as they are, we don't know who they are, and not many of them are very interesting, including the two boys, Darren and Steve.I know this is only the beginning of the long-running series, but ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" looks like one long trailer for another bigger film. ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" looks great and is sporadically engaging.

But instead it turned out to be the funnest, quirkiest vampire movie I've ever seen. Crepsley is just so *not* what you expect from a vampire, and yet he's so perfectly believable as a realistic vampire--no sparkles, no gothiness, just practicality and good-natured cynicism and a multitude of wonderful, funny lines. The pressures and conflicts the two teenage boys go through are remarkably reflective of real-world teen realities, in spite of the supernatural forces that are driving them. And the bad guys are just dangerous and creepy enough to give the movie a dark edge. And yet it never takes itself too seriously.
