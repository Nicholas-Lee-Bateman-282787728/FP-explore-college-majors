The writing, acting, directing, and fight choreography were all excellent. The storylines encompass family, friendship, romance, honor, history, loyalty, legacy, redemption, and personal transformations. The fact that the actor who portrayed Go Ming is Sammy Hung, Sammo's son, is an interesting tidbit. Filming their fight scenes must have been entertaining. I watched all 50 episodes through Netflix and couldn't wait for each disc to arrive.Chinese Playground : A Memoir",5,My Favorite Martial Arts Series,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,564,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'kung-fu', 'films', 'shows', '1960s', 'by-far', 'favorite', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'fight', 'choreography', 'were', 'excellent', 'storylines', 'encompass', 'family', 'friendship', 'romance', 'honor', 'history', 'loyalty', 'legacy', 'redemption', 'personal', 'transformations', 'fact', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Go', 'Ming', 'Sammy', 'Hung', 'Sammo', 'son', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'Filming', 'fight', 'scenes', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'entertaining', 'watched', '50', 'episodes', 'Netflix', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'disc', 'arrive.Chinese', 'Playground', 'Memoir']",N/A

1115668,A3PKZAX2B2Y5WE,B000XY7ZSS,"Mr. Williams ""Book Maniac""","[6, 7]","Good series and filmed well.  My reason for giving 3 stars instead of 5 are:Though title is Wing Chun, the series only contains about 25%, maybe even less, directly realted to Wing Chun or Martial Arts in general. The rest is like a soap opera drama. Though interesting series, if you are expecting all Martial Arts this is not for you.Also, it is too long.  Just goes on and on and on.  They could have condensed this series into about half the length and it would have been much better.Good sets and takes you back in time to 1920s China, though how historically accurate I do not know.Again, would be a great series to watch if it was much shorter in length.",3,"Good, but long",1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,661,"['Good', 'series', 'filmed', 'well', 'My', 'reason', 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'are', 'title', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'series', 'only', '25', '%', 'maybe', 'even', 'less', 'directly', 'realted', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'general', 'rest', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'interesting', 'series', 'are', 'expecting', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'not', 'you.Also', 'too', 'long', 'Just', 'could', 'have', 'condensed', 'series', 'length', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.Good', 'sets', 'back', 'time', '1920s', 'China', 'how', 'historically', 'accurate', 'do', 'not', 'know.Again', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'series', 'watch', 'was', 'much', 'shorter', 'length']",N/A

But be aware that there is no English soundtrack, so it is subtitles all the way. Some people complain that the fight scenes are a little skimpy, but I think there are enough to complement the moderately complex story lines here. This is not a kung fu movie per se, but more of a historical kung fu drama, similar to the way Lonesome Dove was not a traditional western.",5,I Really Enjoyed This,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,499,"['Originally', 'purchased', 'abridged', 'version', 'seriesLEGEND', 'THE', 'TWIN', 'DRAGON', 'Skip', 'go', 'complete', 'series', 'here', 'be', 'aware', 'English', 'soundtrack', 'subtitles', 'way', 'people', 'complain', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'skimpy', 'think', 'are', 'enough', 'complement', 'moderately', 'complex', 'story', 'lines', 'here', 'not', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'se', 'more', 'historical', 'kung', 'fu', 'drama', 'similar', 'way', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'was', 'not', 'traditional', 'western']",N/A

When my wife was out shopping for a few hours, I decided to watch it, and found that there was more to the movie than that.....if you can get your wife or gf to watch it with you, it has a decent story line, very good character development, love interests, and oh yeah, kung fu!  I have to admit, it did start off a little ""cheesy"" and slow (like a cheap soap opera), but after a few discs, it tranformed into a great watch.  It was great to see Yuen Biao again, especially in a Wing Chun film, as I remembered him from the movie, ""The Prodigal Son"", an older Wing Chun film, in which he also starred with Sammo Hung.  I do have to say that the female roles where excellent as well, I have to especially point out the girl that played the character, ""Bun""- she was great and every guy fell in love with her in the movie, and I'm sure most guys that watch the movie will as well.  Final note, the show ended with an absolutely perfect ending!  After it was all done, I sat back and was very satisfied with how they tied it all together.",4,"A little slow at first, but ends just right!",1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,1219,"['purchased', 'set', 'while', 'ago', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'wife', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'marital', 'arts', 'usually', 'ended', 'up', 'other', 'film', 'When', 'wife', 'was', 'out', 'shopping', 'few', 'hours', 'decided', 'watch', 'found', 'was', 'more', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'wife', 'gf', 'watch', 'decent', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'love', 'interests', 'oh', 'yeah', 'kung', 'fu', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'start', 'off', 'little', 'cheesy', 'slow', 'cheap', 'soap', 'opera', 'few', 'discs', 'tranformed', 'great', 'watch', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'again', 'especially', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'film', 'remembered', 'movie', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'older', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'film', 'also', 'starred', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'female', 'where', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'especially', 'point', 'out', 'girl', 'played', 'character', 'Bun', 'was', 'great', 'guy', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'guys', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'as', 'well', 'Final', 'note', 'show', 'ended', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'ending', 'was', 'done', 'sat', 'back', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'how', 'tied', 'together']",N/A
