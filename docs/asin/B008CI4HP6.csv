1550151,A3D3DJKKMLCRYZ,B008CI4HP6,"Erin ""skyblueboy""","[0, 1]","I'm not going to go into too much detail about the plot. Others have covered it and that's not really what people are watching these movies for. Sure, it would be nice if there was an award winning story mixed in with some stellar acting, but we're really here to see what cool fight choreography is presented.Which makes me have to askWHAT FREAKING MOVIE WERE SOME OF YOU WATCHING????!!!The choreography outdated? Maybe I haven't seen every martial arts movie ever. But I have seen all the Tony Jaa and Scott Adkins movies mentioned here and much more. Quite frankly, the acrobatic moves performed by Na Tae-Joo are some of the best I've ever seen by anyone.Whereas others in the past have just done something like a 540 degree kick followed by a brief interlude before doing another kick of some sort, Na Tae-Joo is doing a somersault followed by a back flip where he then does a 720 degree kick.Much ado is made about the uncut scene in the Protector, where Tony Jaa moves up a restaurant taking out bad guys, and he deserves credit for that. But there's a scene in here where Na Tae-Joo takes out at least 12 guys in such stylistic fashion, I have to wonder how anyone can not be in awe of it.Then, of course, there's a scene where he incorporates some dance in with the fighting, which makes me think of the way Bruce Lee used to move. There are many inspiring scenes like these scattered throughout the movie.The rest of the cast isn't as strong in their moves, but no slouches either JeeJa Yanin of Chocolate fame makes an appearance but, except for a few cool moves, she's not as great as she was in that other film. Kim Gyeong-suk, who plays the sister, is much more impressive. Certainly not at the level of Tae-Joo, but definitely no slouch.I think, as far as kicks go, Tae Kwon Do tends to be the most impressive. Punches? Not so much. I think if Na Tae-Joo were to take boxing lessons and lift some weights, he could be even more impressive than he is here.As I mentioned, the story is nothing spectacular. But it does have some genuinely funny moments and, even though it's fairly simplistic, it does have a nice message about allowing people to follow their dreams and also to be understanding of others and their motivations.While I understand people have differing opinions, I don't see how anyone can knock the fights in this movie. Sometimes we come into something new with prior expectations, unable to see what's being presented for how good it really is because we want it to be like what we've come to expect. I feel that may be the case here, because this movie definitely deserves more respect than some are giving it.",5,"You'll get a ki... ah, maybe I won't go there.",1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,2643,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'plot', 'Others', 'have', 'covered', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'watching', 'movies', 'Sure', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'was', 'award', 'winning', 'story', 'mixed', 'stellar', 'acting', ""'re"", 'really', 'here', 'see', 'what', 'cool', 'fight', 'choreography', 'presented.Which', 'have', 'askWHAT', 'FREAKING', 'MOVIE', 'WERE', 'SOME', 'YOU', 'WATCHING', 'choreography', 'outdated', 'Maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'ever', 'have', 'seen', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'Scott', 'Adkins', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'acrobatic', 'moves', 'performed', 'Na', 'Tae-Joo', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anyone.Whereas', 'others', 'past', 'have', 'just', 'done', 'something', '540', 'degree', 'kick', 'followed', 'brief', 'interlude', 'doing', 'kick', 'sort', 'Na', 'Tae-Joo', 'doing', 'somersault', 'followed', 'back', 'flip', 'where', 'then', '720', 'degree', 'kick.Much', 'ado', 'made', 'uncut', 'scene', 'Protector', 'where', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'up', 'restaurant', 'taking', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'credit', 'scene', 'here', 'where', 'Na', 'Tae-Joo', 'out', 'least', '12', 'guys', 'such', 'stylistic', 'fashion', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'awe', 'it.Then', 'course', 'scene', 'where', 'dance', 'fighting', 'think', 'way', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'used', 'move', 'are', 'many', 'inspiring', 'scenes', 'scattered', 'movie.The', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'moves', 'slouches', 'JeeJa', 'Yanin', 'Chocolate', 'fame', 'appearance', 'few', 'cool', 'moves', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'other', 'film', 'Kim', 'Gyeong-suk', 'who', 'sister', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'Certainly', 'not', 'level', 'Tae-Joo', 'definitely', 'slouch.I', 'think', 'as', 'far', 'kicks', 'go', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Do', 'be', 'most', 'impressive', 'Punches', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'Na', 'Tae-Joo', 'were', 'take', 'boxing', 'lessons', 'lift', 'weights', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'here.As', 'mentioned', 'story', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'have', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'even', 'fairly', 'simplistic', 'have', 'nice', 'message', 'allowing', 'people', 'follow', 'dreams', 'also', 'be', 'understanding', 'others', 'motivations.While', 'understand', 'people', 'have', 'differing', 'opinions', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'knock', 'fights', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'come', 'something', 'new', 'prior', 'expectations', 'unable', 'see', 'what', 'being', 'presented', 'how', 'good', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'movie', 'definitely', 'more', 'respect', 'are', 'giving']",N/A

1550153,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008CI4HP6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","The Kick, a Thai/Korean colab, keeps faith with a staple of director Prachya Pinkaew's: phenomenal action beats framed in a weak narrative. Prachya Pinkaew has built up impressive cachet, having guided the likes of Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, Tom-Yum-Goong, and Chocolate to international acclaim. The Kick tracks a Korean family of taekwondo practitioners that immigrates to Bangkok, Thailand and sets up a martial arts school.The movie opens 28 days away from the Olympic tryouts and with the patriarch, Master Moon Sa-beom (Jae-hyeon Jo), psyched about the opportunity for the fam to win a gold medal. Master Moon is one of them stern, autocratic sorts whose word is absolute and final. He's pushing his oldest son, Tae Yang (Tae-joo Na), to master the particularly difficult tornado kick. This doesn't sit well with Tae Yang. He'd rather be a dancer than a martial artist. In fact, Tae Yang has got an audition on the sly, and this ultimately gets in the way of his taekwondo training. Watch the daddy drama attain combustible levels. But the father-son mad-on is only the sub-plot.The story's main thrust revolves around the family's foiling the theft of an invaluable Thai national relic - the Kris of Kings - by a well-coordinated gang of thieves. For their intervention, the family is celebrated as heroes. But you just know the big bad entrepreneur (Kwan-hun Lee) - who'd masterminded the heist - is seething and plotting a retaliation.The Kick's flimsy plot still delivers a bag of treats. The bad guy dramatics are often offset by these injections of humor, with the cast occasionally plying their martial arts to comic effect. I belly laughed all the way thru that scene in which the family is on stage to showcase their taekwondo skills - but the floor proves too slippery.The draw is the action. The movie trots out a parade of dynamic physical sequences. I appreciate that the actors are all martial arts experts and perform their own stunts. The three principals you must keep your eye on are the high-flying Tae-joo Na, Kyung-suk Kim (who plays his sister Tae Mi), and the always awesome JeeJa Yanin (who comes in around 40 minutes in). Tae-joo Na and Kyung-suk Kim are stupendous whirling dervishes with their speed and their acrobatic spin kicks while Jeeja Yanin - who, based on Chocolate alone, is today my favorite female martial artist - stays more grounded but is as just explosive with her forceful application of Muay Thai. By the way, that's another bonus - that we're treated to side-by-side exhibitions of taekwondo and Muay Thai fighting. But my favorite action set is probably Tae-joo Na's fight scene in which he incorporates hip hop dancing into his taekwondo. It's so silly but also awesome.Spelling police! Thumbs down on the filmmakers' lack of attention to detail. It's such a tiny thing, but it bugged me for minutes when I saw that poster in the movie promoting the International Museum of Thailand - site of the Kris of Kings exhibition - and ""Museum"" was spelled ""Musume.""The story is sketchy, the acting is whatever, the spelling falters. Yet, on the basis of how sweet the fight scenes are, The Kick gets 3.5 of 5 stars from me. And do stick around for the closing credits for behind-the-scenes footage of the injuries accrued by the cast and stuntmen. It's like we almost owe it to the cast and crew to watch this footage to acknowledge the hard and extremely dangerous stunt work they'd put in.

WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD:  The Raid: Redemption (2011), Ong-Bak (2003), The Protector (2005) and Chocolate (2009).  If you love them, you could try their second-tier cousins Raging Phoenix (2009), Merantau (2009) and Ong-Bak 2 (2008).Prachya Pinkaew--director of Ong-Bak (2003), The Protector (2005), Chocolate (2009) and currently filming The Protector 2, and producer-only of Ong-Bak 2 (2008) and Raging Phoenix (2009)--disappoints on his most recent release.  The camera work is poor (especially during action scenes and stunts), the editing reveals that the stunts were rarely done fluidly within the fight choreography, and the fight choreography itself felt like it would have been impressive 15 years ago before the Jeeja Yanin (aka Jija Yanin Mitananda), Tony Jaa, Scott Adkins era, but now it just seems dated.The plot is rather simple. A Korean family of Tae Kwon Do Olympians moves to Thailand (for whatever reason) and opens a gym.  While preparing for national Tae Kwon Do day and the Olympic trials they foil some criminals' attempt to steal a valuable artifact and are then extorted to steal it for them.Other than Jeeja Yanin (as Wawa), none of these young kids have been in any movies before.  It's meant to be a cute family martial arts movie but rather than having an air of Jackie Chan charm, it just comes off hokey and poorly executed.  The hits are light, portrayed as far too powerful, and the fights are more silly than clever and, when clever, still poorly executed.I'm confused as to how this was so awful.  It had a $3.5 million dollar budget--slightly less than the $4m for Ong-Bak or $5m for Chocolate.  Couldn't they find more capable young martial artists for cheap?  Stunt men aren't expensive?

He has directed a 2011 Korean-Thai movie ""The Kick,"" starring Cho Jae Hyun and Ji-won Ye as Moon and Yoon, a married couple and taekwondo experts living with their three children in Thailand, where they own a taekwondo gym.The family gets involved with a group of criminals trying to steal the country's national treasure when they accidentally interfere with their heist. Being afraid of further trouble, Moon sends the kids to the home of his old Thai friend Mum (Petchtai Wongkamlao, ""Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior"") and Mum's niece Wawa (Jija Yanin Mitananda, ""Chocolate"").In ""The Kick,"" Jija Yanin Mitananda (or JeeJa Yanin), star of ""Chocolate,"" appears as a supporting character. She shows what she can do and does it brilliantly in the action scenes, but her screen time is limited. The film's best martial arts fights are provided by Tae-joo Na playing Master Moon's first son Tae Yang, who really wants to be a dancer. The film's subplot about Tae Yang's audition is not very interesting, but his amazing combat scenes are worth your money, with his unique ""dance fight"" that is both humorous and amazing.All in all ""The Kick"" is an entertaining action movie with a few jokes here and there. The story is weak and jokes are corny. Be patient and keep waiting for the action to begin.",3,"Taekwondo in Thailand: Martial Arts Action Flcik from the Director of ""Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior"" and ""Chocolate""",1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,1486,"['are', 'avid', 'fan', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'films', 'probably', 'have', 'heard', 'name', 'Prachya', 'Pinkaew', 'director', 'such', 'films', 'Ong-Bak', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'Warrior', 'Tom-Yum-Goong', 'Chocolate', 'directed', '2011', 'Korean-Thai', 'movie', 'Kick', 'starring', 'Cho', 'Jae', 'Hyun', 'Ji-won', 'Ye', 'Moon', 'Yoon', 'married', 'couple', 'taekwondo', 'experts', 'living', 'three', 'children', 'Thailand', 'where', 'own', 'taekwondo', 'gym.The', 'family', 'involved', 'group', 'criminals', 'trying', 'steal', 'country', 'national', 'treasure', 'when', 'accidentally', 'interfere', 'heist', 'Being', 'afraid', 'further', 'trouble', 'Moon', 'kids', 'home', 'old', 'Thai', 'friend', 'Mum', 'Petchtai', 'Wongkamlao', 'Ong-Bak', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'Warrior', 'Mum', 'niece', 'Wawa', 'Jija', 'Yanin', 'Mitananda', 'Chocolate', 'Kick', 'Jija', 'Yanin', 'Mitananda', 'JeeJa', 'Yanin', 'star', 'Chocolate', 'supporting', 'character', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'brilliantly', 'action', 'scenes', 'screen', 'time', 'limited', 'film', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'fights', 'are', 'provided', 'Tae-joo', 'Na', 'playing', 'Master', 'Moon', 'first', 'son', 'Tae', 'Yang', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'dancer', 'film', 'subplot', 'Tae', 'Yang', 'audition', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'amazing', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'worth', 'money', 'unique', 'dance', 'fight', 'humorous', 'amazing.All', 'Kick', 'entertaining', 'action', 'movie', 'few', 'jokes', 'here', 'there', 'story', 'weak', 'jokes', 'are', 'corny', 'Be', 'patient', 'keep', 'waiting', 'action', 'begin']",N/A
1550161,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B008CI4HP6,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[0, 0]","So I watched this film after reading a splendid review of Mr. H. Bala. I give this film a four star rating not because it's a particularly outstanding film, but because it's entertaining with a feel-good quality that makes up for it's flaws. The script is nothing to write home about, the editing could be better, and if you want to be really picky the villains are a bore. Still, there's a lot of charm and cool action, so my advice is to appreciate the fact that this film does not take itself seriously, and fall for the genuine family dynamics.I won't rehash the plot, it's been done in other reviews. What I will rave about is that although the acting certainly isn't award worthy in any respect, all the actors who make up the Hyun family really pulled it off. Not only did they all show tremendous dedication to their fight scenes, making one believe that these people knew without looking how to move together, but the family dynamics were equally flawless. The affection and exasperation present in any close-knit, loving family is present to full effect. That's what sold me on the film.Of course, it's also funny. The comedy bits underscore that you're supposed to just enjoy and not over-think things. It works.The after credits were also lovely and my favorite bit was when Ms. Kim landed a particularly vicious kick to the other Ms. Kim, and shouted, ""UNNI"" (older sister) and raced to hug her and screamed for ice. It's always nice to see acts of respect and kindness.I highly recommend this one.",4,Suits My Sense of the Ridiculous,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,1511,"['So', 'watched', 'film', 'reading', 'splendid', 'review', 'Mr.', 'H.', 'Bala', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'not', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'film', 'entertaining', 'feel-good', 'quality', 'up', 'flaws', 'script', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'editing', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'want', 'be', 'really', 'picky', 'villains', 'are', 'bore', 'Still', 'lot', 'charm', 'cool', 'action', 'advice', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'fall', 'genuine', 'family', 'dynamics.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'plot', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'reviews', 'What', 'will', 'rave', 'about', 'acting', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'award', 'worthy', 'respect', 'actors', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'Hyun', 'family', 'really', 'pulled', 'off', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'show', 'tremendous', 'dedication', 'fight', 'scenes', 'making', 'one', 'believe', 'people', 'knew', 'looking', 'how', 'move', 'together', 'family', 'dynamics', 'were', 'equally', 'flawless', 'affection', 'exasperation', 'present', 'close-knit', 'loving', 'family', 'present', 'full', 'effect', 'what', 'sold', 'film.Of', 'course', 'also', 'funny', 'comedy', 'bits', 'underscore', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'just', 'enjoy', 'not', 'over-think', 'things', 'works.The', 'credits', 'were', 'also', 'lovely', 'favorite', 'bit', 'was', 'when', 'Ms.', 'Kim', 'landed', 'particularly', 'vicious', 'kick', 'other', 'Ms.', 'Kim', 'shouted', 'UNNI', 'older', 'sister', 'raced', 'hug', 'screamed', 'ice', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'acts', 'respect', 'kindness.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one']",N/A
