It really is really funny, full of inside jokes, dark and not-dark humour and just a hoot to watch esp with a group of mates in a Saturday night. I have also found that people in San Francisco Bay Area like it was well as its filmed in and takes place all over San Francisco. Its one of those, &#34;Hey I have been there!&#34; types of film.The plot isn't very important to the film as its the characters that make it. But basically a man with commit issues to start off with, marries a woman and then come to think she had murdered her last three husbands. There is a nice ensemble cast, great acting and Mike does well as both himself and his Scottish expat father. As a native Scottish person I can tell you that his humour at the Scottish although Americanized does hit pretty close to the mark in places.This film is one of those films that has a very loyal following but not so mainstream, cult classic-ish.

But that said, it is an interesting combination of comedy, romance, and horror. It starts in a coffee house. Charlie (Meyers) is talking about his 'women troubles' with his friend Tony. (Tony happens to be an undercover cop.) Tony feels that Charlie is being absurd and paranoid: ""Charlie, every time you meet a nice girl, you come up with some paranoid reason why you should break up with her."" Tony basically feels that Charlie is afraid of commitment, and the possibility of getting married. And we are permitted to go along with Tony's view.We then meet Charlie's parents. The father is also played by Meyers. He has an energetic and theatrical personality. His mother is somewhat of a ditz, but she is sweet in her way. She is worried about a woman in her 'less than universally accepted' newspaper who has been killing off her husbands soon after their marriage. While Charlie is afraid of marriage, he doesn't take the story seriously, seeing that this comes from an 'off beat' newspaper.Charlie then meets Harriet (Travis). He starts to fall for her. She seems to be a sweet girl, but she does have some flaws. (One example is when she asks Charlie if he has ever thought of pushing someone off a cliff.) Harriet then starts to say some things that make Charlie think the story in his mother's newspaper is true, and that Harriet may be the killer.Tony thinks Charlie is being paranoid because on a subconscious level, Charlie thinks that Harriet may be Mrs. Right. But we are allowed to wonder at this point if Charlie's fears are valid. Charlie and Harriet break up for a short while, but they soon get back together. In an especially touching moment, Charlie's father thanks him for giving them a nice anniversary party, and then Charlie and Harriet decide to get married. (Interesting that the anniversary of his parents help Charlie overcome his fear of getting married.)There is a comical, but at the same time, nice wedding reception. (An especially poignant moment is when Charlie and his father embrace.)All seems well, but Tony start finding things out about Harriet that make him fear for Charlie's life. Throughout the movie, we may have felt like we were watching a comedy or a romance. But the last 1/2 hour looks like a Halloween movie. There is a surprise twist that I won't give away.The best thing about this movie is that sometimes we think we're watching a romance; other times, we think it's a comedy; and the last half hour falls into horror.

Even when I don't, this movie is guaranteed to paste a smile on my face for the rest of the day.I have to say something else:  I have never watched a movie that has made me want to move to a certain place so much as this one makes you want to move to San Francisco!Pity that the powers that be show no signs of coming out with a ""collector's edition"" or anything like that.

162326,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0800126130,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 4]","So I Married an Axe Murderer is an early Mike Myers attempt at comedy that is somewhat of an unsuccessful experiment, but it still has lots of funny parts and is entertaining as long as you don't demand too much of it. Myers plays Charlie Mackenzie, a San Francisco poet, and he also plays his own father, Stuart Mackenzie, an abrasive Scotsman. The Scotsman character is one that he cooked up for Saturday Night Live, but while it didn't quite work out for SIMAAM (So I Married an Axe Murderer) it led to him doing the voice for the ogre Shrek, which is obviously based on his Scottish voice, and we all know how that worked out.Strange but funny in a strange way, but also sort of funny in a ha ha ha way, is when Stuart Mackenzie sings pop hits from Scottish singers. The Bay City Rollers and Rod Stewart get the Stuart Mackenzie treatment, with the Do You Think I'm Sexy? lead guitar break done on bag pipe. Bizarre! The most effective use of music in SIMAAM is a cover of Here She Comes with stellar production done by the Boo Radleys (you have to like a band named after the scary character played by Robert Duvall in To Kill a Mockingbird). The song is the theme for Harriet, and illustrates the intense feelings she evokes in Charlie.Nancy Travis as Harriet Michaels, the mystery woman who steals Charlie Mackenzie's heart, is really good. She later married the producer, Rob Fried, and they had two kids together. I wondered if it was a casting couch audition situation, but she redeemed herself.Charlie Mackenzie: How many people have you brutally murdered?Harriet Michaels: Well, brutal's a very subjective word. I mean, what's brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to somebody else.She was funny and cute and very likable, yet, she could also make you shudder with dread, thinking she really could be an axe murderer. She sang, she danced, she cavorted with Charlie, she sparkled, she sizzled, she spoke several languages, she sang ""Only You"" in several languages (just like the lounge singer who was murdered in Atlantic City!!!!!); but mostly she just fed Charlie straight lines:Harriet Michaels: Do you actually like haggis?Charlie Mackenzie: No, I think it's repellent in every way. In fact, I think most Scottish cuisine is based on a dare.Which reminds me of another hole in the plot. Harriet works in a butcher shop; The Meats of the World, but after a scene where Charlie helps her out (actually just an excuse for an extended Mike Myers medley of gratuitous meat jokes) the butcher shop is never mentioned or seen again. You'd think that it would provide at least some opportunity for axe murderer situations?San Francisco plays much more than a cameo role. In fact, San Francisco is the real star, and Mike Myers merely a supporting player. I wonder how a Canadian could have such an affinity for Baghdad-by-the-Bay, as Herb Caen used to refer to it. Great San Francisco scenes, but when it zooms in on the club called Roads it is in Jack Kerouac Alley, and it is where City Lights Bookstore or Vesuvio's bar would be. It was really jarring, because they had this great zoom in from aerial shot through the kitchen, like the scene in Good Fellas that was copied in Swingers. But then when they reach Jack Kerouac Alley, instead of Vesuvio's the bar where Jack (and I) used to drink, or City Lights Bookstore, that published Howl by Allen Ginsberg, among many other great works of literature, we find instead the totally fictional club, Roads. And where were the strip clubs like Carol Doda's on Broadway and Columbus, which was really right there just next to Jack Kerouac Alley?[first lines]Charlie Mackenzie: Excuse me, miss? There seems to be a mistake. I believe I ordered the *large* cappuccino. *Hello!* Look at the size of this thing.Tony Giardino: It's practically a bowl.Charlie Mackenzie: It's like Campbell's Cup-O'-ccino!This was kind of a cute scene, but a little too cute. Can we have a moratorium on *Hello!* spoken like Jerry Lewis used to say *Lady!*? This would have been better placed in Cafe Trieste rather than Roads, the faux Vesuvio's. You know, there was another coffee shop that was right on Columbus and I once saw Rob Schneider in there drinking an espresso and writing. We made eye contact, and I was this close to doing the whole copy guy riffing on his name shtick, but I could tell by the look he gave me that was the last thing he wanted, and he was on a roll, probably he had just come up with a brilliant idea, like Deuce Bigelow, Male Gigolo. And I was never one to interfere with Great Art.The faux Vesuvio's can be forgiven, however, because for the most part they really got the flavor of San Francisco down, and I'm not talking about Rice 'A Roni!!!!! No Ringold Alley, but still. The scene where Harriet scratches his back, directed by Charlie with references to the topography of San Francisco and Oakland alone is worth the price of admission.Sometimes Mike Myers is cute and amusing in SIMAAM, but other times he is only trying to be cute and amusing, but failing miserably. Charlie Mackenzie is no Wayne, but perhaps Austin Powers can be seen as an extension of both Charlie and Stuart Mackenzie. for instance, there is a scene where Charlie drops his towel, but the full backal nudity is merely gratuitous. Later, he perfects the formula in Austin Powers, and it becomes hilarious.Mike Myers poetry was a pretty good parody of the poetry scene. Kind of clever, especially with the jazz trio that backs him, but really bad. I have seen so many poets who had that forced cadence, but were just bad, not in a funny way. He reminded me a lot of a poet I knew, but who was actually very good and talented, but his poetry also had a great sense of humor. I think his name was Kevin Cline, not the actor, who spelled his last name with a K, but perhaps I am mistaken. However, if Kevin Cline or someone who remembers him from San Francisco State reads this, I would like to know what ever became of him.Charlie Mackenzie: Harriet. Harry-ette. Hard-hearted harbinger of haggis. Beautiful, bemuse-ed, bellicose butcher. Un-trust... ing. Un-know... ing. Un-love... ed? ""He wants you back,"" he screamed into the night air like a fireman going to a window that has no fire... except the passion of his heart. I am lonely. It's really hard. This poem... sucks.There were lots of little cameos and small parts, like Bob Scarlatti, Cintra Wilson, Steven Wright as a pilot, and Alan Arkin, as Tony Giardino's boss, the Police Chief. Cintra Wilson is more of a local celebrity, as she had a column that was like the new, hip, Herb Caen that ran in the Examiner, the Chronicle's rival. Michael Richards (Kramer of Seinfeld fame) has a very amusing scene with character actor and Second City graduate Mike Haggerty.Obituary Writer: There's another one here. Native San Franciscan. Plumber. Elliot, Ralph. Moved to Dallas, disappeared four months ago, body was found in a sewer.Obituary Employee: Well, guy takes his job too seriously, life goes down the drain.[both laugh]Charlie Mackenzie: Did they mention anything about his wife?Obituary Employee: All right, okay. Look, I know that we're talking about real people here. I'm sorry.Charlie Mackenzie: No no, I'm serious. Did they mention the wife?Obituary Employee: Look, I'm sorry you know. You know, I didn't mean to make a joke about other people's lives.Charlie Mackenzie: No no, I'm really serious. Did they mention the wife?Obituary Employee: You win, you win okay? I'm a bad person!Obituary Writer: Just take it easy!Obituary Employee: No, he's sayin' I'm insensitive! He's sayin' I'm a ****!Obituary Writer: He's not sayin' you're a ****!Charlie Mackenzie: [yelling] Did they mention the wife? Did they mention the wife?Obituary Employee: No! No! They didn't mention the wife! Ya happy?[speaking to the whole office]Obituary Employee: YEAH! Oh yes, yeah. I'm insensitive! I'm a very insensitive man! Stop your job, look at the insensitive man! That's what they're paying you for![leaves]Obituary Writer: He was my ride home.Charlie Mackenzie: Understood...In light of the subsequent Michael Richards melt down, the ""insensitive man"" tirade would seem to be prophetic.Amanda Plummer is the daughter of Christopher Plummer and Tammy Grimes. She was in Pulp Fiction with Tim Roth. In So I Married An Axe Murderer she plays the strange sister of Harriet Michaels, Rose Michaels. Her best scene is where she makes Charlie breakfast after Charlie and Harriet have spent the night together for the first time:Rose Michaels: Let me make you some breakfast.Charlie Mackenzie: Oh, gee, you know, I'd love to. But you know, I'm really running late, but thanks!Rose Michaels: What would you say to silver-dollar pancakes, fresh-squeezed orange juice, bacon, and Kona coffee?Charlie Mackenzie: Well, that sounds great![Cut to Rose pouring cereal in Charlie's bowl]Rose Michaels: Sorry. I didn't have those other things.Charlie Mackenzie: No, no, that's fine. That other stuff will probably kill you... whereas ""Froot Loops"" are light, and reasonably high in fiber. I care for ""Apple Jacks"" a great deal.Anthony LaPaglia could have been good as the friend who works as an undercover cop, Tony Giardino. The part wasn't written well, and he is forced to deliver some of the worst lines in the whole film. This scene is the worst:Charlie Mackenzie: So Tony, what's the deal with your clothes?Tony Giardino: What do ya mean?Charlie Mackenzie: You look like Huggy Bear from Starsky and Hutch.Tony Giardino: What do ya mean? I look hip!Charlie Mackenzie: No no no no no no, you look like an undercover cop TRYING to look hip.Tony Giardino: I AM an undercover cop trying to look hip.I am not kidding; he is wearing a derby wrapped with a fuzzy pink feather boa. No, really. Anthony LaPaglia plays Detective Jake Malone currently on the crime drama Without a Trace. He usually plays either cops or mobsters. Here, he is playing a cop, but mostly is under utilized, though he does get in a few chuckle inducing scenes, and even a chortle here and there. Debi Mazar is Tony's girlfriend, but she doesn't really have any good material here, either. Best thing about her scene is it was filmed in Fog City Diner, and afterwards Charlie and Harriet walk home in the rain.Faring much better than Tony and Debi is Phil Hartman who is fantastic in a small but intense role, a cameo, practically, where he is Alcatraz Tour Guide John Johnson (but his friends call him Vicky). Don't watch this film on TV because they will cut out this scene, guaranteed.Preposterous plot, with huge gapping holes. The story of course, from the title you know, and I'm not giving anything away, that he thinks his wife is an axe murderer. He hears her say ""Ralph"" in her sleep, and Ralph is the name of one of the victims of Mrs. X, a mysterious woman who disappears when soon after the wedding her husbands are murdered. When Harriet introduces Charlie to Ralph, it is a woman. But later, they are still linking her to the murder of Ralph. In other words, if Ralph really was one of her ex husbands who was murdered, isn't a little too much of a coincidence to have a female friend also named Ralph? I say, if you bring in a female Ralph, then you can't keep the storyline about the murdered ex husband Ralph going. It is like the denizen of Amelia's bar who wanted to have her Kate, and Edith, too.TOP TEN MOVIES WITH SOME SLIGHT CONNECTION TO SIAAM1.Pulp Fiction(1994) ... Amanda Plummer is perhaps best remembered for this film.2.The Fisher King(1991) .... Breakthrough role for Amanda with Robin Williams.3.To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)(1962) .... Robert Duvall played Arthur ""Boo"" Radley, which provided a name for a band that played Here She Comes.4.Shrek (Full Screen Single Disc Edition)(2001) .... Mike Myers as the voice of the ogre Shrek owes it all to Stuart Mackenzie.5.Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery (New Line Platinum Series)(1997) .... Mike is both Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, and his propensity for playing dual roles is foreshadowed in SIMAAM.6.Dr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat (Widescreen Edition)(2003) .... Myers is The Cat in the Hat, but he is no Jim Carey.7.Wayne's World(1992) .... Myers created the memorable Wayne Campbell character for SNL. Who knew he could sustain a feature length film?8.54(1998) .... Myers plays Steve Rubell, owner of Studio 549.Coneheads(1993) .... Phil Hartman showed the way as Marlax, and Mike Myers took note. Perhaps you could sustain a feature length film with an SNL sketch?10.Rosemary's Baby(1968) .... Charles Grodin is Dr. C.C. Hill, and he also has a cameo in SIMAAM.I care for ""Apple Jacks"" a great deal.",3,"I care for ""Apple Jacks"" a great deal",1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,12664,"['So', 'Married', 'Axe', 'Murderer',

Lowerson,"[3, 3]","This 1993 release with Mike Myers and Nancy Travis is a laugh out loud, right off your chair, comedy highlighting Mr. Myers add libb antics pioneered on Saturday Night Live.  It tells the story of a single Scottish American looking for love despite a growing list of failed relationships.Mike Myers not only plays the lead character, Charlie, but also portrays Charlie's father a outspoken Scottish immigrant that in his spare time dusts his personal Scottish hall of fame portraits while wearing only hosery with the Bay City Rollers at full blast.  Hysterical, if for no other reason the role of Charlies father is reason enough to pick up the film at its more than economic price.In all seriousness the film gives hope to the jaded romantic by contrasting the still blooming relationship of Charlies' parents with the new friendship between Charlie and Nancy Travis.  The shocker is that where Wayne's World and Austin Powers, more recent, have met with amazing sucess in theatre ticket sales where as So I Married a Ax Murderer met with little fanfare.

I enjoy it, I laugh, but in the end it's not that memorable, with a few notable exceptions: (1) Myers' portrayal of the crusty Scottish father is great fun, and has the most quotable lines in the film. (2) The undercover cop who wants his captain to act more like a crusty commisioner (like police captains in the movies), and the captain's attempts to do so.Sadly, Myers as the main character is not as good; while well-acted and funny, he's in virtually every scene and we tend to tire of him.  Nancy Travis, the love interest, seemingly exists only to laugh at Myers' antics (but she holds her own much better than Heather Graham's atrocious work in Austin Powers 2).  Thus, individually the jokes are funny, but they are too much of the same thing.  Having said that, Myers is one of the few former SNL comics to make a film that is actually funny!  While adapting some of his SNL characters, they are not one-joke copies (imagine if the father in this film only said, ""If it's nae Scottish, it's ....!"")  Also, look for a ""sneak preview"" of Dr. Evil, whose voice (if not his body) makes an appearance.The DVD is very disappointing - save your money and get the VHS tape.  The video and sound are fine, but there are no extras (except the trailer).  It's typical of a first-generation DVD, and a ""special edition"" has not yet appeared (perhaps waiting for a Mike Myers Box Set).",3,"Sweet and fun, but not Myers' best",1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,1478,"['Most', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'can', 'raise', 'such', 'strong', 'emotions', 'enjoy', 'laugh', 'end', 'not', 'memorable', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', '1', 'Myers', 'portrayal', 'crusty', 'Scottish', 'father', 'great', 'fun', 'most', 'quotable', 'lines', 'film', '2', 'undercover', 'cop', 'who', 'captain', 'act', 'more', 'crusty', 'commisioner', 'police', 'captains', 'movies', 'captain', 'attempts', 'do', 'so.Sadly', 'Myers', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'well-acted', 'funny', 'virtually', 'scene', 'tend', 'tire', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'love', 'interest', 'seemingly', 'only', 'laugh', 'Myers', 'antics', 'own', 'much', 'better', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'atrocious', 'work', 'Austin', 'Powers', '2', 'Thus', 'individually', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'Having', 'said', 'Myers', 'one', 'few', 'former', 'SNL', 'comics', 'make', 'film', 'actually', 'funny', 'adapting', 'SNL', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'one-joke', 'copies', 'imagine', 'father', 'film', 'only', 'said', 'nae', 'Scottish', 'Also', 'look', 'sneak', 'preview', 'Dr', 'Evil', 'voice', 'not', 'body', 'appearance.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'disappointing', 'save', 'money', 'get', 'VHS', 'tape', 'video', 'sound', 'are', 'fine', 'are', 'extras', 'trailer', 'typical', 'first-generation', 'DVD', 'special', 'edition', 'not', 'yet', 'appeared', 'perhaps', 'waiting', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Box', 'Set']",N/A
162332,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,0800126130,Cubist,"[10, 12]","Unfairly slammed by critics when it first came out, So I Married An Axe Murderer has become something of a cult film with a small, but dedicated following. I have always felt that this was Mike Myers' best (and most personal) film to date because he doesn't feel the need to hide behind tons of make-up as he does in the Austin Powers films and also the character of Charlie's dad and his insane love of all things Scottish seem to be an obvious reference to Myers' real-life dad. Everything about this film has an cozy, intimate vibe that is much more personal and engaging.How can you go wrong with a killer cast like this one? First off, you've got Anthony LaPaglia who rarely does comedies and is just great as a frustrated cop who feels more like Fish from Barney Miller than Serpico; there's the kooky Amander Plummer playing yet another bizarro role (does she play any other kind?); the great Brenda Fricker as Charlie's very Scottish mom (another casting against type); and a whole slew of cameos ranging from Charles Grodin and Alan Arkin to Steven Wright and Phil Hartman.What makes this film so good is the insanely quotable dialogue. Pretty much anything Myers says as his dad is classic (&quot;HEAD! PANTS! NOW!&quot;) and the film really hits a groove when he's on-screen. There are a couple moments when you can see LaPaglia actually breaking character as he cracks up over Myers' Scottish rantings about the Pentavert! And then you've got Myers' dead-on homage/parody of Jack Kerouac-style Beat poetry that is so well done -- especially if you're familiar with his style of prose and the way he speaks it.I really hope that some day soon Myers revisits this movie with a lavish special edition DVD treatment it so richly deserves. He's obviously hip to the medium, judging by the extras-packed editions of his Austin Powers films. In the meantime, fans will have to be content with this bare bones DVD, which at least, restores the film's theatrical aspect ratio.",4,So when's the Special Edition coming out?,1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,1979,"['Unfairly', 'slammed', 'critics', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Married', 'Axe', 'Murderer', 'become', 'something', 'cult', 'film', 'small', 'dedicated', 'following', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'best', 'most', 'personal', 'film', 'date', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'hide', 'tons', 'make-up', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'films', 'also', 'character', 'Charlie', 'dad', 'insane', 'love', 'things', 'Scottish', 'seem', 'be', 'obvious', 'reference', 'Myers', 'real-life', 'dad', 'Everything', 'film', 'cozy', 'intimate', 'vibe', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'engaging.How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'killer', 'cast', 'one', 'First', 'off', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'who', 'rarely', 'comedies', 'just', 'great', 'frustrated', 'cop', 'who', 'more', 'Fish', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'Serpico', 'kooky', 'Amander', 'Plummer', 'playing', 'yet', 'bizarro', 'role', 'play', 'other', 'kind', 'great', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'Charlie', 'very', 'Scottish', 'mom', 'casting', 'type', 'whole', 'slew', 'cameos', 'ranging', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Steven', 'Wright', 'Phil', 'Hartman.What', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'insanely', 'quotable', 'dialogue', 'Pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'Myers', 'dad', 'classic', 'quot', 'HEAD', 'PANTS', 'NOW', 'quot', 'film', 'really', 'groove', 'when', 'on-screen', 'are', 'couple', 'moments', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'LaPaglia', 'actually', 'breaking', 'character', 'up', 'Myers', 'Scottish', 'rantings', 'Pentavert', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Myers', 'dead-on', 'homage/parody', 'Jack', 'Kerouac-style', 'Beat', 'poetry', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'especially', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'style', 'prose', 'way', 'it.I', 'really', 'hope', 'day', 'soon', 'Myers', 'movie', 'lavish', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'so', 'richly', 'deserves', 'obviously', 'hip', 'medium', 'judging', 'extras-packed', 'editions', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'films', 'meantime', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'content', 'bare', 'DVD', 'least', 'film', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio']",N/A
162333,A2OVUDBRWGX0LL,0800126130,David,"[9, 10]","This movie was panned by a number a critics upon its release in theaters, and I haven't a clue as to why.Mike Myers, whom I'm not the biggest fan of, hits the bullseye in his portrayal of the neurotic Charlies MacKenzie, a young man who is so afraid of commitment that he spends as much time trying to think up reasons to end his relationships with members of the opposite sex as he does in enjoying the relationships.  Myers, who has a penchant for portraying multiple characters in his movies, also plays his own father--a man who's convinced that Colonel Sanders puts an addictive chemical in his chicken to ""...make you crave it fortnightly.""The beautiful Nancy Travers, as Harriet, enters Charlie's life when he stops in one day at her butcher shop to buy his father some haggas (sp?).  After dating and often hilarious miscommunications, they marry.  Then Charlie's imagination starts to get carried away (again) as he suspects his new bride as being an axe murderer who kills her new husbands while on their honeymoon.The other characters that fill out this movie are truly wonderful.  You have, Tony, played by Anthony LaPaglia, Charlie's best friend and a cop who can't seem to find any satisfaction with his job.  In his words to his Captain:  ""When I became a cop I thought I was going to be Serpico, but now I feel like Fish on Barney Miller.""  He goes on to say that he yearns to hang from that ""thing on the bottom of a helicopter"" (a la the opening credits of ""McCloud,"" starring Dennis Weaver).Funny stuff!Other characters include Alan Arkin in an uncredited role of Tony's precinct captain, who LaPaglia believes is ""too nice"" to be a police captain.  Arkin's artificial transformation into a abusive, bigotted, out-of-control cop (to please LaPaglia) is worth the price of rental alone.  Then you have in smaller roles:  Brenda Fricker, playing Charlie's mother, who has the hots for Tony--and isn't shy about making him aware of it, even in front of her son; Phil Hartman, as ""Vicki,"" a tour guide for Alcatraz; Charles Grodin, as a uncooperative private citizen; and Amanda Plummer, as Rose, Harriet's mysterious sister who is definitely more than she originally passes herself off as.

Myers delivers with ease when he's under the guise of a wild, colorful character - his best scenes are as a boisterous, drunken caricature of a father under heavy makeup - but comes off as insecure and off-putting in the more straightforward leading role. For every joke that lands, Myers ricochets three or four duds off his companions' foreheads, lending the impression that he's always on stage and robbing his turn as well-intentioned poet Charlie of a meaningful connection with the audience. Clunky, distracting post-production work and an excessive dose of early '90s pop culture also prove to be tricky obstacles, dating the material and lending the impression that it wasn't quite polished enough for a final release. When it's working, few films from the era are so consistently funny, but those sporadic dots of brilliance aren't quite enough to compensate for the shaky, timid nature of the rest of the story.

162338,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,0800126130,Earl Hazell,"[5, 7]","I have figured out the incredible appeal of Mike Myers with this movie.  Much like the character he plays in this mess of a funny movie, he is to comedy what prose poetry is to literature, and jazz is to American music.  He is a poet of a comedian, with a unique sense of improvisational timing and beyond-silly ideas of what is funny and ironic- and just plain stupid- in people.  His impersonations and creations of characters are not just great, it's the characters he chooses to impersonate or create that make his signature.  The Irish dysfunctional father figure for example (or Scottish, forgive me if I've offended somebody) is a figure I would have never in a million years thought to recreate, and he did it to such an impeccable degree in SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER that both my girlfriend and I were falling off the bed laughing!  All while still surrendering himself and his humor to the overall comedy in the irony of the plot: a man who is committment phobic actually has the most insane excuse for getting out of another relationship- only this time it might be true, and it could cost him his life.Fans of Mike in general probably already have this; those who don't will certainly want to after seeing it, even if it is seeing it again.  Anyone who has seen the ubiquitous AUSTIN POWERS series will get to see where, how and when the artistic/visual and comedic rhythms and ideas he used to such amazing success in those films became part of his craft in this one; all of the characters of AUSTIN POWERS I and II and their masterful performances seem like a natural progression after seeing this .The boy is funny; no one will argue that.  But this movie is uniquely funny because of how it showcases his unique style, in ways that make you look forward to his future, while cracking you up.

Then he started over-doing that British/Scottish-accent humor to the point that it became annoying, reaching his comedic nadir with Austin Powers, easily the worst comedy I've ever tried to sit through (it was so bad, I had to turn it off halfway through, and I've never looked back).Fortunately, this movie came out before Mike Meyers became truly annoying. It's kind of hard to watch this movie without thinking of some of the SNL characters Meyers created (particularly Linda Richman - HEL-LO!), but his performances are hilarious. His portrayal of Charlie's Scottish father is out-and-out, over-the-top funny, and will have you quoting several of his lines for weeks after a given viewing. Fortunately, his portrayal of Charlie is, relatively speaking, fairly restrained.Anthony LaPaglia is great as the cop who wants to be Serpico (but isn't), and who wants his boss to be like the hard-nosed ones from 70's cop shows (Starsky & Hutch, et. al.) (but he isn't), while Alan Arkin is funny as his kind-hearted boss who tries to oblige him (but can't quite get it right). Nancy Travis manages to be both funny and vulnerable at the same time, so that you're actually rooting for Harriet and Charlie to finally get together. Amanda Plummer is cast - surprise! - as the type of character she's usually called on to portray. Kind of an ill fit (though because of the plot), but she makes it work (more or less).Overall, this is a cute, romantic light comedy.

This is, after all, a film by the legendary Mike Myers who before this didWayne's World [1992] and after did the best James Bond imitation in cinema Austin Powers [1997]. If this is a miss, then it is practically the only miss that Mike Myers ever had (oh, exceptThe Guru [2002]).So, what's the film about? The title tells you a lot, but only enough to help you understand why Charlie (Mike Myers) is scared to marry Harriet (Nancy Travis). Like all good films, the title is actually used like a straight-man from which the comedy comes - all the way through you think you can see exactly where the plot is going, but actually it turns out differently.And far from being twee, Myers displays all the funny bones & natural charisma that he displays in Austin Powers. Best of all, Myers plays his Scottish father to perfection (a role he repeated as 'Fat Bastard').Last of all, there is the soundtrack, which takes a lot of inspiration from the Brit Pop around at the time, with songs such as There She Goes and Two Princes peppering the soundtrack.AsThe Rough Guide to Comedy Moviesrecommended, so I pass on - this is a forgotten comedy gem that deserves the same cult status asAnnie Hall [1977] andChasing Amy [1997] as one of the first romantic comedies that are ten-a-penny nowadays.",5,Very Underrated,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,1638,"['suppose', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'off', 'film', 'title', 'predictable', 'twee', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'mixture', 'gorey', 'goofy', 'rather', 'likeOne', 'Wedding', 'Lots', 'Funerals', '[', '1994', ']', 'only', 'reason', 'tried', 'was', 'was', 'recommended', 'book', ""'d"", 'read', 'Comedy', 'films', 'forgotten', 'classic.And', 'actually', 'book', 'had', 'point', 'film', 'legendary', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'who', 'didWayne', 'World', '[', '1992', ']', 'did', 'best', 'James', 'Bond', 'imitation', 'cinema', 'Austin', 'Powers', '[', '1997', ']', 'miss', 'then', 'practically', 'only', 'miss', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'ever', 'had', 'oh', 'exceptThe', 'Guru', '[', '2002', ']', '.So', 'what', 'film', 'title', 'lot', 'only', 'enough', 'help', 'understand', 'why', 'Charlie', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'scared', 'marry', 'Harriet', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'good', 'films', 'title', 'actually', 'used', 'straight-man', 'comedy', 'way', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'exactly', 'where', 'plot', 'going', 'actually', 'out', 'differently.And', 'far', 'being', 'twee', 'Myers', 'funny', 'bones', 'natural', 'charisma', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'Best', 'Myers', 'Scottish', 'father', 'perfection', 'role', 'repeated', ""'Fat"", 'Bastard', '.Last', 'soundtrack', 'lot', 'inspiration', 'Brit', 'Pop', 'around', 'time', 'songs', 'such', 'Goes', 'Two', 'Princes', 'peppering', 'soundtrack.AsThe', 'Rough', 'Guide', 'Comedy', 'Moviesrecommended', 'pass', 'forgotten', 'comedy', 'gem', 'same', 'cult', 'status', 'Hall', '[', '1977', ']', 'andChasing', 'Amy', '[', '1997', ']', 'one', 'first', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'ten-a-penny', 'nowadays']",N/A

It doesn't matter how perfect his girlfriend is, he finds some reason to end the relationship.Then, into his life, walks Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis).  With just one smile, she melts Charlie's heart.  It's love at first site, and Charlie is ready to leave his bachelor days behind him.There's just one little problem.  Reports are circulating the country about a Mrs. X who kills her husbands on their wedding night.  And Charlie thinks that Harriet may be Mrs. X.  Is he just coming up with another excuse not to commit?  Or is he signing his life away by asking Harriet to marry him?I'm not normally a fan of Mike Myers' comedy, and this movie reminded me why.  The reliance on sexual jokes and situations for comedy never appeals to me.  Mike also plays Charlie's dad Stuart, and I just found that character annoying.To further complicate things, the story is rather dull.  We know what's coming, and the movie takes too long getting there.  If I had been enjoying myself along the way, I wouldn't have minded.  But since I wasn't, I didn't.  I actually enjoyed the sub-plot about Charlie's friend Tony (Anthony LaPaglia) and his disappointment in his job as a cop more then the main story.The only thing that gives the movie that second star is the climax.  It was actually funny and interesting.  It's not enough to make the movie worth watching, but at least it was entertaining.Die hard Mike Myers fans do love this movie.

Myers plays dual roles as Charlie MacKenzie, a commitment fearing coffeehouse poet and his dad, Stuart, a paranoid, singing, hard drinking Scotsman complete with accent. After a series of failed relationships, all of Charlie's self undoing, he meets the perfect woman in Harriet (Nancy Travis), a sweet butcher. Charlie's inhibitions get the best of him when he starts suspecting a few things. As far as the DVD, it pretty much sucks and can be described as a bit of a disappointment with the exception of three languages (including english), and the film's strange trailer which pretty much describes what the movie's going to be like in a nutshell. If you see the trailer, there's a deleted scene in the movie. That's something that I don't like about certain DVDs. They just put the trailer and the standard stuff on it but don't put anything else on it like the TV spots like some actually do.

I'm bummed that on YouTube, the only excerpts that are shown from this are either the scenes at the MacKenzie house, or a poetry reading, which is a total waste of time, just something to fill in around Mike Myers' not quite fully inflated ego.

I dislike Wayne's World and  despise Austin Powers.This charming movie, however, Myers' fourth  film outing, shows a subdued and sweet actor finding his way among a dozen  equally-talented, incredible comedic actors.  Other reviewers have focused  on Myers' portrayal of the racy Scottish father, but to me that's just  another example of him chewing up scenery like it was chocolate-covered  graham crackers.  Instead, take some time to watch him interact with Amanda  Plummer or Anthony LaPaglia, his underappreciated costars.  He is quiet,  charming, vulnerable and funny, without being obnoxious.The story is  about Charlie McKenzie, a beat poet in San Francisco who has a history of  dumping women for stupid reasons (&quot;She smelled like soup...beef  vegetable soup...&quot;  He meets Harriet, a lady butcher, with whom he  falls in love.  But wait!  Is it possible she's the murderous Mrs. X, who  marries men and kills them on their honeymoons?  Charlie thinks so, and the  ride is on from there.Pay special attention to the hysterical  interplay between Alan Arkin and LaPaglia who play a police captain and  undercover detective, respectively.  Also watch for the uncredited costar,  the city of San Francisco, which is shot more beautifully here than I've  seen in any other film.This DVD deserves a lot of extras,  commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes, etc.  With a stunning  cast like this one, there must be treasures moldering in a vault somewhere,  but you'll find none of them here.

It's not the drum I march to, but there are some things about this movie that make it better than much horror and comedy on the market today. (And sometimes I do need a laugh between movies relating to the works of Shakespeare and Dickens.) First the story is well constructed, and even the title of the movie plays an important part in leading us to believe something. Next, Charlie's friend Tony almost immediately gives an important line: &quot;Charlie, every time you meet a nice girl, you come up with some paranoid reason why you should break up with her.&quot; Later Charlie meets Harriet and he tries to keep his friend's message in mind. The irony is well constructed in that this is one time Charlie may very well have something to worry about! First we are lead into believeing something very bad is up; then we gradually receive information that says there is nothing to worry about; then the tension arises and we learn that Charlie is in fact in a bad spot! (Along with Charlie, we worry, relax, and start to panic. Excellent!) Charlie's parents are handled well. Through their appearances, we can see where Charlie gets a lot of his traits; we also get to see disputes between them; but in important things we see the love they have for each other; Charlie organizes a nice 30th anniversary party for them; and at Charlie's wedding Charlie and his father hug. Even secondary characters like Charlie's friend Tony, Tony's boss who is too nice, and Charles Grodin seem to make the most of their screen time. I said this is better than a lot of comedy out there. (To be sure, there is some humor that is in bad taste, and sometimes it's overdone.) But there is enough humor that involves a clever exchange of wit; there is humor that may not be funny to the characters in the movie, but is so to the audience. Also, much of the humor contains information vital to the story. I said that this is better than a lot of horror out there. This is because the movie starts quite normal. We are gradually exposed to information that may constitute some fear; the scenery is dramatized, but NOT overdone. And even though there is not a lot of blood, it is the CONTENT OF THE STORY that scares us.",3,"Actually, Quite Well Done",979948800,"01 20, 2001",2001,2241,"['Actually', 'give', 'movie', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'not', 'drum', 'march', 'are', 'things', 'movie', 'make', 'better', 'much', 'horror', 'comedy', 'market', 'today', 'sometimes', 'do', 'need', 'laugh', 'movies', 'relating', 'works', 'Shakespeare', 'Dickens', 'story', 'well', 'constructed', 'even', 'title', 'movie', 'important', 'part', 'leading', 'believe', 'something', 'Next', 'Charlie', 'friend', 'Tony', 'almost', 'immediately', 'important', 'line', 'quot', 'Charlie', 'time', 'meet', 'nice', 'girl', 'come', 'up', 'paranoid', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'break', 'up', 'her.', 'quot', 'Later', 'Charlie', 'Harriet', 'keep', 'friend', 'message', 'mind', 'irony', 'well', 'constructed', 'one', 'time', 'Charlie', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'something', 'worry', 'First', 'are', 'lead', 'believeing', 'something', 'very', 'bad', 'up', 'then', 'gradually', 'receive', 'information', 'nothing', 'worry', 'about', 'then', 'tension', 'arises', 'learn', 'Charlie', 'fact', 'bad', 'spot', 'Charlie', 'worry', 'relax', 'start', 'panic', 'Excellent', 'Charlie', 'parents', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'appearances', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'Charlie', 'lot', 'traits', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'disputes', 'important', 'things', 'see', 'love', 'have', 'other', 'Charlie', 'nice', '30th', 'anniversary', 'party', 'Charlie', 'wedding', 'Charlie', 'father', 'hug', 'Even', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Charlie', 'friend', 'Tony', 'Tony', 'boss', 'who', 'too', 'nice', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'seem', 'make', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'said', 'better', 'lot', 'comedy', 'there', 'be', 'sure', 'humor', 'bad', 'taste', 'overdone', 'enough', 'humor', 'clever', 'exchange', 'wit', 'humor', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'funny', 'characters', 'movie', 'so', 'audience', 'Also', 'much', 'humor', 'information', 'vital', 'story', 'said', 'better', 'lot', 'horror', 'there', 'movie', 'quite', 'normal', 'are', 'gradually', 'exposed', 'information', 'may', 'constitute', 'fear', 'scenery', 'dramatized', 'NOT', 'overdone', 'even', 'not', 'lot', 'blood', 'CONTENT', 'THE', 'STORY']",N/A

Both women seem to have lived in the same cities at the same time; both share acquaintances with the same names. Myers, expressing his fears to cop and friend Anthony LaPaglia, becomes convinced he's next on the chopping block. &quot;Axe&quot; is not art by any means. It's often overly taken up with resolving itself. But Myers and others create an enjoyably loose, anti-slick feeling about the affair. Amanda Plummer is amusingly off-kilter as Travis's weird sister; Alan Arkin makes much of a small role as LaPaglia's painfully sensitive supervisor. Among the cameo players, Phil Hartman is an amusingly fascistic guide at the Alcatraz prison and Charles Grodin works with superb understatement as a laconic driver reluctant to give up his car to desperate officer LaPaglia. I won't say anymore other than that if you're a mike fan then this is essential viewing.",3,Not art by any means...,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,1779,"[""n't"", 'Mike', 'best', 'oppinion', 'alot', 'better', 'Shrek', 'Anyway', 'quot', 'Axe', 'quot', 'aspiring', 'neo-beat', 'poet', 'San', 'Francisco', 'who', 'had', 'terrible', 'luck', 'women', 'not', 'great', 'beat', 'poet', 'one', 'speaking', 'halting', 'Captain-Kirkian', 'timing', 'burning', 'cigarette', 'hand', 'jazz', 'combo', 'plays', 'slide', 'images', 'flash', 'wall', 'latest', 'song', 'out', 'be', 'Chorus-like', 'prelude', 'movie', 'latest', 'obsession', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'beautiful', 'butcher', 'who', 'flesh', 'Meats', 'World', 'When', 'Myers', 'Scottish', 'mother', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'avid', 'reader', 'World', 'Weekly', 'News', 'Madame', 'X', 'black-widow', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'husbands', 'honeymoon', 'nights', 'more', 'kooky', 'tabloid', 'fare', 'meeting', 'falling', 'love', 'Travis', 'observe', 'disturbing', 'similarities', 'Madame', 'X', 'women', 'seem', 'have', 'lived', 'same', 'cities', 'same', 'time', 'share', 'same', 'names', 'Myers', 'expressing', 'fears', 'cop', 'friend', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'next', 'chopping', 'block', 'quot', 'Axe', 'quot', 'not', 'art', 'means', 'often', 'overly', 'taken', 'up', 'resolving', 'Myers', 'others', 'create', 'enjoyably', 'loose', 'anti-slick', 'feeling', 'affair', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'amusingly', 'off-kilter', 'Travis', 'weird', 'sister', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'much', 'small', 'role', 'LaPaglia', 'painfully', 'sensitive', 'supervisor', 'cameo', 'players', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'amusingly', 'fascistic', 'guide', 'Alcatraz', 'prison', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'superb', 'understatement', 'laconic', 'driver', 'reluctant', 'give', 'up', 'car', 'desperate', 'officer', 'LaPaglia', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'other', ""'re"", 'mike', 'fan', 'then', 'essential', 'viewing']",N/A
