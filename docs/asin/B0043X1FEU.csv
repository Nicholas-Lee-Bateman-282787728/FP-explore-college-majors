McParland,"[10, 11]","If you ever watch the documentary S&Man you'll become familiar with Bill Zebub and the people who make these types of absolutely gutter punk unredeemable, underground indie horror films. Really don't waste your time. I'm a fair fan of exploitation art. This is just empty space. There's nothing there to hang your hat on. No story, no talent at all. The photography and quality of the production don't even offer anything. Believe me that I'm not offended at all by good dirty exploitation fun. I'm offended by the fact that hacks like this even have the gall to release such untalented unimaginative trash. I truly do implore you to skip this because you'll never be able to get that precious time you wasted back.

It was really just some unintelligent babble intertwined with strange grimacing.Nothing of value here at all.  Absolutely no plot or character development.

1384496,AZK7RTMQ4L4T1,B0043X1FEU,Steve,"[85, 91]","With a name like Bill Zebub, you probably have a pretty good idea of what you're getting in terms of film quality, acting, and plot.  That should frame your expectations, so you don't complain that the camera work doesn't hold up when compared with Titanic, or something ludicrous like that.  It is pretty much what it claims to be.  You'll see a variety of young women stripped, have demeaning sexual acts performed upon them, and threatened heartily.  The majority of the movie is seen from the perspective of the rapist.  That's...pretty much it.  It suffices as a plot, puts things into some kind of context, but probably won't engage your mind very much.  Overall, not very enjoyable to my tastes.  The women were all fairly attractive, goth-type chicks.  They do appear to get completely nude, and the camera wanders over them to reveal lots of detail (but little enough that ""appear to get"" is the operative phrase here).  The 'action', such as it is, is focused on the humiliation of being raped by a stranger, with the unusual addition that rapist forces one woman's father to do the honors.  Visually, it's about what you'd expect.  Fit, young women are shown with some good lighting, but the camera is kind of unsteady at times.  The droning background music is repetitive which inspires more of a feeling of annoyance than the dread that was obviously intended.  Plot-wise...yeah, I've talked about that already.  The 'surprise ending' isn't.  After the ending, there are a series of advertisements for Mr. Zebub's other work, which promise to be much more active but less revealing.Anyway, I sated my curiosity, but it'll be a while before I watch another Bill Zebub movie.  I don't feel completely ripped-off, at the price I paid.",2,"Low-grade ""independent film""",1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,1744,"['name', 'Bill', 'Zebub', 'probably', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'terms', 'film', 'quality', 'acting', 'plot', 'should', 'frame', 'expectations', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'camera', 'work', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'when', 'compared', 'Titanic', 'something', 'ludicrous', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'be', ""'ll"", 'see', 'variety', 'young', 'women', 'stripped', 'have', 'demeaning', 'sexual', 'acts', 'performed', 'threatened', 'heartily', 'majority', 'movie', 'seen', 'perspective', 'rapist', 'pretty', 'much', 'plot', 'things', 'kind', 'context', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'engage', 'mind', 'very', 'much', 'Overall', 'not', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'tastes', 'women', 'were', 'fairly', 'attractive', 'goth-type', 'chicks', 'do', 'appear', 'get', 'completely', 'nude', 'camera', 'reveal', 'lots', 'detail', 'little', 'enough', 'appear', 'get', 'operative', 'phrase', 'here', ""'action"", 'such', 'focused', 'humiliation', 'being', 'raped', 'stranger', 'unusual', 'addition', 'rapist', 'forces', 'one', 'woman', 'father', 'do', 'honors', 'Visually', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Fit', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'shown', 'good', 'lighting', 'camera', 'kind', 'unsteady', 'times', 'droning', 'background', 'music', 'repetitive', 'more', 'feeling', 'annoyance', 'dread', 'was', 'obviously', 'intended', 'Plot-wise', 'yeah', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'already', ""'surprise"", 'ending', ""n't"", 'ending', 'are', 'series', 'advertisements', 'Mr.', 'Zebub', 'other', 'work', 'promise', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'active', 'less', 'revealing.Anyway', 'sated', 'curiosity', ""'ll"", 'be', 'while', 'watch', 'Bill', 'Zebub', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'completely', 'ripped-off', 'price', 'paid']",I Told You Not to Call the Police!
