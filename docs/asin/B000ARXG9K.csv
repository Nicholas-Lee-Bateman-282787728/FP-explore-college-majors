If cussing makes you uncomfortable this movie may not be for you, and if questionable content (i.e. adultry, STD's, etc) is offensive, you may want to skip this movie.  It was all in all an ok movie, but a little heavy on the female bashing, men may like that after all they generally are on the receiving end of the bashing.

Each case was different.  It also includes clips of robert towsend (his is funny), flex and other men describing thier issues with women. I actually like the choice of women also.
