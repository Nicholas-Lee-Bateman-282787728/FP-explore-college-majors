Giving up their cell phones and jumping into a pink trailer, the 2 socialites head for a crazy road trip filled with halarious misadventures. The journey includes a stop at a local fast food restaurant where the suddenly penniless gals order practically everything off the menu and then admit innocently that they're out of money. This is not the only time that ""no-money"" has entered the picture. They even try to help the police but turn things upside down as they serve lunch to inmates and speak to them when they're not supposed to. They also pull people over for no apparent reason.Other episodes include them staying with a religious family, working as maids at a hotel, and there's even an unexpected accident involving Paris falling off a horse.The Simple Life has become a guilty pleasure and a favorite among many people, including myself. The girls are practically posterchildren for ""no shame"" and it's hard to watch them make insanely silly mistakes. But Richie and Hilton are fun to watch.

In fact, all three seasons so far have seen these two rich socialites plucked from the norm (to them) and placed in a place that seems foreign with people who just don't understand them.  The fact remains though, that these two girls survive by being themselves, incapable of work, unwilling to work, and unable to work...and they drive everyone insane and then redeem themselves with their charm and sweet hearts (they really are sweet girls)...So this season sees them cross country traveling from FL to Cali and the who way there they stop and live with families getting jobs you'd never expect them to do.  The funniest episodes involve the Local Police Dept. where they use their new power to harrass the locals & the Nudest Colony where they are hired as maids and end up posing as guests, charging food to the room and calling for another maid to clean the room.

The story now is that Paris and Nicole have to drive from Miami to Beverly Hills (they travel in a trailer). Once again without cash, credit cards or cell phones.This season has 10 episodes, all them very funny but my favorites are the ones where they go to work to a hotel as housekeepings. It's very funny because instead of working they call room service like they were hotels guests and when they're eating they call a housekeeper to make the room they had to clean. And my other favorite one is when they go to work to a sausage factory and they simply make a mess. All the episodes are very good, like one they go to work to a men prison, in another they work in a beauty salon.Paris and Nicole make a great couple, each one in her own style but finally they are outrageous.This DVD contains great special features including a lost episode from season one and never before seen footage.With this show you won't laugh a lot but you definitely won't get bored.Finally I want to say that with the languages and subtitles appears that there are Spanish subtitles but they don't work.

It's not meant to be some great television show, nor some extremely real reality show.

Because what those adults don't seem to understand is that the entire SHOW is making fun of Paris and Nicole being stupid and spoiled. Paris and Nicole are also BOTH making fun of themselves being stupid and spoiled. They have a good sense of humor about themselves and their public image, so they were making fun of it with this show. That was kind of the entire point.I find it absolutely ridiculous that grown adults still have that mentality of ""NO! I'M ALLOWED TO MAKE FUN OF YOU BUT WHEN YOU JOIN IN AND START LAUGHING AT YOURSELF IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE."" Grow up, people. Stop taking everything so goddamn seriously.The show is absolutely hilarious if you take it for what it is and just admire the girls for having a sense of humor about who they are. People just need to take a step down off of their OWN blue collar thrones and stop thinking that Paris and Nicole are beneath them simply because they're always in the spotlight.

I've never seen the first or the fourth, and I've seen a few episodes in series 3 Interns, but otherwise that's it. I've never seen the rest of them cheap enough yet. This one was dead cheap, so I snatched it up straight away, even if I did get slated for buying it.The thing about the Simple Life is you will rarely admit to buying it. Or admit to watching it. It's something that's meant to be kept a secret, cos it's simply not ""cool"".I'm ""coming out of the closet"" and admitting I love watching the Simple Life. Sure, it's all scripted beyond belief, it's edited down from lots of footage to barely 20 minutes. And it stars one of the biggest self promoters you can possibly get. (Yes Paris I'm talking about you!)But I love Nicole Richie. And despite her recent weight issues, I'll buy her biographies, and the Simple Life. She is the ultimate rock chick. And she's the true star of the show unlike Paris.But one question is why is this show censored? The swear words are beeped out and there are some scenes where both girls are wearing low cut trousers, and it's been blurred out!!!This will remain my one guilty pleasure, probably until I get the rest of the DVDs, but I just don't understand why it's been censored, it so stupid!

Here they are more experienced at what things will and won't give them laughs, and they have a real challenge to work for.  They are on a road trip to drive cross country from Florida to California, without any money or credit cards, having to live off the kindness of strangers.  People have done it without the luxury trailer and pick up they are living in.  Here they meet up with people for just a few days rather than having to live with them in extended circumstances.  They do everything from having to make sausage, be mermaids at an amusement park, to waxing a man's hairy back.  They can and will get themselves into a lot of trouble with people.The only words of criticism are for that of Nicole rather than Paris.  For all their bumbling antics and silliness, Paris seems to be the more friendly and cooperative one.  Nicole is much ruder and abrasive with people, even when they are being harassed by the redneck teenage boy they have the misfortune of staying with for a spell.  She is not big enough to walk away from it, and instead gives him the special sausage that she made out of dog food for him.

Paris' pet Chihauhau Tinkerbell returns and Nicole's adorable, fiesty Shih Tzu Honey Child (love the name) is brought along for the journey.Once again the pampered socialites' cell phones and credit cards are confiscated and they must work several jobs along the way in order to make it back home, including training for spots in Florida's Weeki Wachee Springs mermaid show (of course Paris gets to be the mermaid while poor Nicole looks ridiculous in her turtle costume), serving as maids at a nudist resort called Caliente, making a total mess of sausage making in Mississippi, and pulling pranks on customers at a Texas hair salon. Ya know, the usual.The best thing about season 2 is how varied the host families are. Most of them are friendly (God bless the religious family that put up with Nicole's potty mouth), but a few aren't so nice. The son of a Mississippi family believes the girls will be rude and act as though they're above everything (well it's not like he was too far off the mark) so he decides to give them their comeuppance. Not a good idea to cross those two and let's just say he got his just desserts. WOOF!
