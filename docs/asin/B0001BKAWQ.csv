799294,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,B0001BKAWQ,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[16, 16]","This DVD contains two 30 minute monologues from Jeff Foxworthy.  They are a bit dated as he looks very young here.  These monologues are filled with his southern goofball shtick - lots of good jokes about married life, crazy family members, goofball things people do, and of course his infamous You Might Be a Redneck If ... jokes.The one thing I am surprised about is how much of the material he used back then is still in his routines now.  And it's all so funny you just never get tired of hearing them.  Even though it's short and sweet, it's quite funny and worth plopping down a few bucks for.",3,Young Jeff Foxworthy,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,599,"['DVD', 'two', '30', 'minute', 'monologues', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'are', 'bit', 'dated', 'very', 'young', 'here', 'monologues', 'are', 'filled', 'southern', 'goofball', 'shtick', 'lots', 'good', 'jokes', 'married', 'life', 'crazy', 'family', 'members', 'goofball', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'course', 'infamous', 'Might', 'Be', 'Redneck', 'jokes.The', 'one', 'thing', 'am', 'surprised', 'about', 'how', 'much', 'material', 'used', 'back', 'then', 'still', 'routines', 'now', 'so', 'funny', 'just', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'hearing', 'Even', 'short', 'sweet', 'quite', 'funny', 'worth', 'plopping', 'down', 'few', 'bucks']",N/A

This DVD must have been produced more than ten years ago as his daughter had just been born.

Most of his material about single life, relationships, and southern living are based on his own family experiences and really hit a cord.As Jeff says, ""Rednecks ain't just in the SOuth.

Thirty minutes is a bit short for a standup routine, but including a pair of them does make the DVD worthwhile, even if it feels like slightly less than a full show.  Foxworthy jokes about single life, married life, his firstborn, and of course, includes some 'you might be a redneck' jokes.  His recollections of being single and broke are particularly amusing.  All of the material is solid, and there are no slow spots to speak of.  The subject matter of the two shows overlap a bit, which makes them feel a tiny bit redundant when watched back-to-back, but the jokes are unique.  This DVD doesn't represent the best that Foxworthy has to offer, but he has an excellent rapport with his audience and delivers smoothly and with superb timing.  This should be considered good viewing for most comedy fans.",3,"Short, But Sweet",1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,892,"['disc', 'two', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'performances', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'Thirty', 'minutes', 'bit', 'short', 'standup', 'routine', 'including', 'pair', 'make', 'DVD', 'worthwhile', 'even', 'slightly', 'less', 'full', 'show', 'Foxworthy', 'jokes', 'single', 'life', 'married', 'life', 'firstborn', 'course', ""'you"", 'might', 'be', 'redneck', 'jokes', 'recollections', 'being', 'single', 'broke', 'are', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'material', 'solid', 'are', 'slow', 'spots', 'speak', 'subject', 'matter', 'two', 'shows', 'overlap', 'bit', 'feel', 'tiny', 'bit', 'redundant', 'when', 'watched', 'back-to-back', 'jokes', 'are', 'unique', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'represent', 'best', 'Foxworthy', 'offer', 'excellent', 'rapport', 'audience', 'delivers', 'smoothly', 'superb', 'timing', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'viewing', 'most', 'comedy', 'fans']",N/A
