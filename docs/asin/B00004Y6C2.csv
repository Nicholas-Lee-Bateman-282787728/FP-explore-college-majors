Harmer,"[10, 12]","When people are asked to name great 80's teen movies, they will almost invariably list THE BREAKFAST CLUB, 16 CANDLES, PRETTY IN PINK, etc. But no one will ever mention TUFF TURF. I wonder why this is? In fact, I'd never heard of this movie until my boyfriend showed it to me. Talk about the most underrated flick of all time! One look at it immediately took me back to my own 80's teenagehood. Did anyone notice how typical of the decade the girls dressed? Forget Molly Ringwald; she wasn't 80's. She was Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" look mixed with some kind of post-modern late-80's/early 90's get-up. If you want bona-fide 80's fashion, take a look at Frankie, a.k.a. Kim Richards, of TUFF TURF. Also, there were a requisite number of mullets in this movie, more than in any other 80's flick I can think of. These are the reasons I consider TUFF TURF to be the premier movie of the 80's.I got a kick out of Robert Downey Jr., who looked no older than a middle schooler!The story line works well. I felt sorry for Morgan Hiller and his family b/c they had sunk to such new socioeconomic lows; however, I think Morgan's travails are an entirely realistic depiction of what a kid in his situation would go through and how he would react to it.Marianne Faithful sings the haunting theme song during the movie's opening segment.

558369,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00004Y6C2,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[9, 16]","Everybody has to start somewhere, and while Tuff Turf (1985) wasn't James Spader's first film, I do believe it was the first film he actually had the lead role in as Morgan Hiller, possibly the world's oldest high school student (Spader was about 25 years of age when he appeared in this film).  Directed by Fritz Kiersch (Children of the Corn, Gor), the film features, along with Spader, popular child actress Kim Richards (Escape to Witch Mountain, Meatballs Part II), Paul Mones (Streets of Fire), Matt Clark (White Lightning, Brubaker), Claudette Nevins (Sleeping with the Enemy), and the miracle of modern science Robert Downey Jr. (Weird Science, Back to School)...seriously, I'm surprised this guy is still around, given his love for both legal (alcohol) and illegal substances.As the movie begins we see Morgan Hiller (Spader) riding his ten-speed bicycle through the dark, busy L.A. city streets sans any reflective clothing (kids, don't try this at home...it may seem cool, but how cool is it to be laid up in a hospital for six months when you get creamed by a car?)...anyway, we see some gang members (I use the term `gang' loosely here, as they're the typically 80s gang types, sporting bandanas and rough trade clothing, the kind that wouldn't last five minutes in the real world) rousting a businessman.  Morgan rides through and breaks up the action, raising the ire of the faux punks, who vow vengeance.  Turns out Morgan and his family were once well-to-do Connecticut types, until his father, played by Clark, lost his business, and they since had to relocate to the comparatively modest setting of  L.A.'s inner city (Morgan's mother, played by Nevins, is as WASPy as they come, and seems to be taking the adjustment harder than the rest).  As Morgan attends his first day at the local high school, the gang from the night before, lead by Nick (Mones), take notice, and begin giving him a hard time, especially after Morgan takes a shine to Nick's girlfriend Frankie, played by Richards.  After this a number of things happen like a choreographed number during a rock concert at an abandoned warehouse, a dead rat in a locker, Morgan and Frankie crashing a posh country club affair (complete with Morgan serenading Frankie on the piano...oh geez), someone gets shot, Morgan puts the moves on Frankie, and so on, leading up to the final showdown between Nick and Morgan, and, as per the tagline for the film, we learn `tuff turf' is `where enemies are made, reputations are earned and love is the most risky affair of all'...or something like that...Well, I'll say this for Tuff Turf, it's certainly steeped in the 80s... bandanas, fried hair, too much make-up, fingerless gloves, studded belts, rayon shirts, hi-top sneakers, painters caps, hand cuffs used as accessories, an over abundance of synthesized music (there's a `synthesizer realization' credit at the end, which, to me was a fancy way of saying `keyboardist'), and so on...the movie was okay, but there seemed to be just a bit too much crammed into the story, causing the film to run a lot longer than it needed to...there's the main plot device in the love triangle between Morgan, Frankie, and Nick, and then there's various subplots that don't really go anywhere like Morgan being compared to his more successful older brother, friction between Morgan and his mother, Morgan and Frankie coming from different sides of the tracks, the angle of Morgan's family once being wealthy and now having to `slum' it, Frankie still dealing with the passing of her mother, etc.  Seemed like all of these secondary elements were touched upon as to try and force some sort of character development, but none of them were ever really explored to properly do so...in my opinion, much of this could have been left out, and the film would have worked much better.  Also, that lengthy, choreographed dance number at the warehouse, along with Spader's character impromptu piano serenade towards Frankie at the country club (by the way, I highly doubt that was Spader actually singing), were two things I could have done without, but then I'm not really big on ill-fitting musical numbers.  One aspect that really annoyed the hell out of me was the crummy, zen-like, new age bunk passed off by a couple of the characters in the film.  In one scene, Morgan's father, the once wealthy businessman, now cabbie, passes along this little nugget...""Life isn't a problem to be solved, it's a mystery to be lived, so live it!""  Uh, yeah, okay...seeing as how he was once a rich and powerful leader of industry, now reduced to (gasp!) driving a cab (night shift, no less), I'd be pretty reluctant to take any advice from him.  Another scene has Morgan spewing out the following line...""I don't think you can hold on to anything until you let it go.""  Just what the hell does that mean?  It sounds pretty...overall, the performances aren't that bad (Kim Richards is awful easy on the eyes), if you can buy off on that Spader's supposed to be a high school student.  Paul Mones, who played the main antagonist Nick, was a bit over the top for my tastes, but then there's always one in a movie like this.  The funniest aspect for me was Morgan's mother, played by Claudette Nevins...she had obviously yet to fully come to terms with her new, modest surroundings, maintaining her country clubbish attitudes that were way beyond her and her families' current means.  Robert Downey Jr.'s part was meager, and was more or less the same character he played in the film Back to School (1986), only in that latter film it was more realized.  Overall Tuff Turf is decent, but it could have been a lot better had they lost a few of the clunkier elements of the story and tightened up the running time (the film runs nearly an hour and forty-five minutes).  If you want to see a better film from the 80s with Spader (as the baddie), I'd suggest checking out The New Kids (1985), recently released onto DVD.The picture quality, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic, on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release looks sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio comes through well, with no complaints.  The only extras included are a theatrical trailer and an insert booklet featuring a still photo collage from the movie.Cookieman108By the way, here's an interesting nugget...did you know both James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. are high school dropouts?  Probably not something either are proud of, but it's true...",3,"""Don't let them fool you...of course size matters, this is the 80s!""",1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,6469,"['Everybody', 'start',

He's new in town, and foils a mugging that is taking place.  This sets him up as the target for the local gang.  Which is pretty much what half the movie is about, how the gang wants to get him, and how he foils their attempts.  The other half is the budding romance of Spader and Richards.  Kim Richards plays the gang leaders girl friend and slowly falls for Spader.

James Spader has also remained possibly my favorite actor of all time since I fell for his incredible face after seeing IT for the first time here as well.James Spader plays Morgan Hiller, the cute(!!!!) new guy at a highschool in a seedy part of Los Angeles.  Immediately Morgan incenses the town gang by ruining a heist they're pulling by going by on his bicycle and spray-painting Paul Mones who plays the gang leader.  His girlfriend played by child actress almost grown-up Kim Fields, is secretly amused by Morgan's nerve.  Never one to back off, Morgan sees what he wants, and goes for the girl.  The result is a dangerous ""Turf"" war between the Spader and Mones characters that lead to an eventual showdown over Fields.Robert Downey Jr. plays a great role here as well as Spaders' loyal new pal in town.  He sticks with his buddy Morgan until the bitter end.There is great atmosphere and pacing in this film. It truly has no dull moments.  The leads are well cast, and VERY easy on the eyes.  The story makes you really care about the characters, a sure sign of quality filmakng in my book.  Spader as Morgan Hiller is particularly excellent here.  After seeing this in the theatre, I knew he would become a star.  A funny note, Spaders tattoo of a Spade on his upper arm is seen here in a locker room scene.  It is also seen in the great Rowdy Herrington classic ""Jack's Back.""  It is NOT seen however in ""White Palace"" or ""Dream Lover"" despite the nude scenes in both.  Was it removed, or covered?  I don't know about that, but I DO know that ""Tuff Turf"" remains as fresh a teen angst love story now, as it was nearly 20 years ago.

Having said that, I'm glad I didn't see this as a teen in the 80's as I doubt I would have enjoyed it.  The acting is overly dramatic, the plot is predictable start to finish and the soundtrack is forgetable.  That is what my teenage self would have said.  My adult self however, just loved this movie.  It was basically everything you remember about 80's movies in a single two hour serving.I found myself fondly remembering my time in decade, and singing along to the soundtrack.  Yes, you will shake your head a few times at the over-the-top script and acting, but two minutes later you will be smiling at your repressed memory of the 80's.If you are a fan of the 80's, or grew up in the 80's, do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

Newcomer and rich kid James Spader moves to a new town, pretends he's a rebel and quickly makes enemies with the local high school hoodlums. Being too darn smart for his own good, he falls for Lead Hoodlum's best girl. Lo and behold, she dreams of a better life and likes him right back, but is too afraid of Lead Hoodlum to trade up. Yawn.
