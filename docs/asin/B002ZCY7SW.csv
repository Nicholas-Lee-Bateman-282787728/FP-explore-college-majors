This show, like many great shows, suffers from the dilemma of whether to stick to the &#34;if it isn't broken don't fix it&#34;point of view. There's nothing new here really. The first bad guy is really like the fourth guy down the ladder or something. Jack takes it too far and...there's a bad guy on the inside feeding other bad guys information. Jack ends up being pursued by the same government agency he was working for five minutes before. If all this sounds familiar, it's because, after 8 years, the show is pretty played out. Don't get me wrong, it's still 24 and I enjoyed it but expect the same old song and dance because that's what you get here.

At least the ending is in harmony with the character of Jack Bauer. I thought the scene with Jack Bauer trapping President Logan's convoy in the tunnel was a classic 24 scene. It is the kind of scenario that makes this series so much fun.I give the writers and actors credit for inventing a type of writing and acting that falls into its own category.

The best thing I can say about this show is that it is very intense. The action is fast paced and it is a real soap opera in that it always keeps you coming back for the next episode. The writing is a little weak and some of the lines on the show are so bad its almost a comedy. For one thing, I don't think it was ever meant to be watched back to back to back. When you watch several shows in a row, the idea that the main character can get shot, stabbed, beaten up, stabbed and still be alive seems very unbelievable. The production values are so so and you have to laugh to think a field agent can call up a president on the cell phone and talk to them. You really have to let reality slip away when you watch this show and just take the story with a gain of salt.That all said, it is a great show to watch if you are doing something like working out. It keeps your mind occupied which allows you to exercise without the thoughts of what your body is doing. There are slight breaks between segments and you can advance the show to the 2 minute mark when watching a new episode as it is a rerun of the first show.I watch this on Amazon prime so I am just a viewer.

Which in the big scheme of network TV, means it's just OK.Nice to see Jack go postal in the last few shows and return to those bad ass moves so many 24 fans came to love. It redeems what have otherwise been a very weak season. Some of the plot twists are so overdone in this series it becomes almost laughable. (a mole in CTU? AGAIN? Really? They really need to work on their screening process.)  But at least no family members are kidnapped to force someone to do something they don't want to do.  I REALLY got tired of that one.I really loathe this ultra liberal President Taylor character, a holdover from the previous season. But at least we get to see her evolve into the same kind of political hack all presidents become. The ends always justify the means.  One more eye roller was the miraculous return of Mr Smarmy himself, President Logan (Huh? I though he got stabbed to death by his former wife two seasons ago. No matter. Resurrection is common in 24. Recall Tony's miraculous return from the dead last season. And, of course, Jack does it almost every season. )This season is modestly entertaining but doesn't kick in until the second half. Not as tightly written as many earlier seasons. Many things make absolutely no sense. Lots of plot holes (a master Russian spy intimidated by a couple of street thugs for half the season? Logan's reappearance without explanation as to how he recovered from death?

Where have we seen those plot lines before?  Oh, that's right.  In several other episodes of 24.  There is little that is original in the Season 8 story line.  Plot twists, the bread and butter of the 24 series, were identifiable before they happened.  All you had to do was recall the previous years' episodes.Some suspension of belief has always been necessary to watch 24, but Season 8 broke the common sense barrier.  A cop tazes Jack and beats him severely.  Renee knifes him deep into the abdomen.  The bad guy strings up Jack and shocks him into unconsciousness while probing fingers dig into the knife wound.  He gets tazed again, takes two automatic weapon rounds in the chest (while wearing a Kevlar vest but a devastating blow nonetheless), suffers a flesh wound to the shoulder, and gets thumped on the head several times.  Yet each time, he pops back up with the spring of a frisky colt and can even get it on with Renee while enduring injuries that each should have immobilized him.  Jack Bauer isn't a secret agent.  He's a professional wrestler!*On the good side, the ending was tense and was the strongest part of Season 8.  We all were certain that, in this last season finale, Jack was going to die.  It was just a matter of how and who went with him.  But, no, the producers left the door open for more.  Don't do it, producers.  Let 24 fade into memory.  It's said everything it can say and more.*Probably the worst example of 24 wanting viewers to buy into the impossible was in the second season when Jack's plane crashed into a mountain side.  As the next episode opened, there was Jack strapped to his seat, just a little groggy after his ordeal.  And there was Nina already up and alert and shooting a pilot whose body, in reality, would have been spread across the mountain along with hers.  And, of course, Jack and Nina remain in such good physical condition that they can run around the mountainside trying to kill each other.

Kapoor manages to pour depth and complexity to his character in a relatively small number of episodes in a series that has become more action than character driven over the years.Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer is excellent as usual. He has had several seasons to grow and improve, and though he has played Jack for such a long time, Sutherland is not careless or tired but focused and resolute and the  viewers will still find it intriguing and exciting to see how Jack would react to the impossible situations brought to his doorstep time and again.Wait for the revenge attack he embarks on in the third part of the season and witness one of the most violent, bloody and angry campaigns he has ever engaged in the show - and prepare to enjoy every minute of it.For the last time on Television, get ready for the wild ride of ""24"".

Please, please, please let a movie deal go through like I heard a rumor for! I will miss Jack Bauer. He is a man of action who can go 24 hours without eating, sleeping, or going to the bathroom. He was my inspiration for my roller derby name, Jackie Bauer. And now once more he has descended into the darkness.This year was the year CTU moved to New York. They were right, how many times can you almost blow up Los Angeles? A year and a half after Day 7, Jack Bauer played by Kiefer Sutherland becomes involved once again at CTU after rumors of assassination attempts threaten to ruin a peace treaty taking place between U.S. President Allison Taylor played by Cherry Jones and Kamistan President Omar Hassan played by Anil Kapoor (""Slumdog Millionaire""). Renee Walker played by Annie Wersching eventually returns because of a deep undercover background she has with suspects involved and her past comes back to haunt her as she proves a little mentally unstable in the line of duty. However, as a love interest for Jack, on his final day, Day 8, Jack finally gets laid. Booyah, my man! About time!Chloe O'Brian played by Mary Lynn Rajskub returns to CTU in New York as well to help out. She has outwitted, outlasted, and outplayed every other character in the series short of Jack himself. It is amazing how this character who started out as a babysitter with symptons of Asperger's syndrome to undermining all authority figures to be Jack Bauer's last line of communication and defense in all situations. Though they probably don't get together for kids' birthday parties or anything, she is probably his best friend. What does she do in this season? Gets threatened, helps Jack, gets threatened, helps Jack, rats out suspicious coworkers, helps Jack, you get the idea.Katee Sackhoff plays Dana Walsh, an operative at CTU who at first appears to be a whiny weakling with emotional baggage and an ex-con ex-boyfriend terrorizing her and eventually flips the switch to reveal more secrets about herself. Her fiance, Cole Ortiz is played by the long absent Freddie Prinze, Jr. (who is a writer for the WWE by the way, fun fact!) thinks she has cold feet but his head is spinning when her truth comes out. Also former President Charles Logan played by Gregory Itzin makes a special appearance for eight episodes to be just as evil as ever and tries to tempt President Allison Taylor into compromising her morals to get the peace treaty signed. And what season of ""24"" wouldn't be complete without a quick appearance by Kim Bauer played by Elisha Cuthbert? No, she doesn't get eaten by a bobcat. She just ups the stakes for what Jack could win or lose like always.An exciting last season, no disappointment here except for the temporary doubt of Allison Taylor's character when she gets sucked in by Logan's deceit. This is a worthy addition to your collection. I still miss President David Palmer, it's just not the same seeing him sell Allstate Insurance or whatever.Bonus Features:""The Ultimate CTU"" talks about all the adjustments made for moving the series this year the is a behind the scenes bit about what they wished to accomplish. What is REALLY awesome is the featurette called ""Virtually New York"" where they show you how much green screening they did! You never would have guessed! In L.A., it's easy to shoot a show for nine months, but in New York, there are seasons. They did a fantastic job hiding snow in alleys, or they'd shoot Kiefer Sutherland walking down an ordinary sidewalk and then show you what it looked like on the show with a split screen showing all the tall buildings they added next to him. They were able to virtually add sunsets, sunrises, New York landmarks, and tons of stuff that would have been very difficult and expensive to shoot. A set that might cost thousands of dollars to build for a short scene instead can have elements and by shot against a moving green screen backdrop and have everything else added later. Totally blew my mind since it isn't obvious at all in the show.There is a featurette called ""Chloe's arrest"" that shows what happens to Chloe for helping Jack escape as she is taken into FBI custody. I'm crossing my fingers that this is a trailer/segway or possible intro to what could be a ""24"" movie!!

1299601,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002ZCY7SW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","Old habits die hard. Jack Bauer is out of C.T.U. and is in New York convalescing from his exposure to a bioweapon from last season. All Jack wants to do now is fly out to Los Angeles, to spend time with his daughter and grand-daughter. But one bleeding informant shatters Jack's serenity, this stool pigeon apprising him of a plan to assassinate the charismatic President of the Islamic Republic of Kamistan (Anil Kapoor, terrific), who is in New York to establish peace relations with the United States. And there goes the reluctant Jack Bauer, handling field ops again, risking his life again, having another crapawful day. But Jack can still adapt to any tricky situation, is as implacable as ever (and he still yells orders a lot). Old habits die hard. The opening episode revs it up, treating us to a whiff of 16 BLOCKS.24 - Season 8 - or as I like to call it, Betrayathon! - superbly closes out one of television's most innovative and controversial series and, the way it ends, I wouldn't be surprised at all if a 24 movie were in the offing. As usual, Jack has to pierce layer after layer of conspiracy. The twists and turns may give you whiplash. Neat ""What the--?!"" moments include an unexpected promotion for Chloe and the return of a familiar snake in the grass. And it wouldn't be 24 unless key characters are navigating thru many moral and political pitfalls, being forced into grey area compromises, except that the grey area always seems to get darker, yeah? Here's a game: Drink a shot every time a character validates their actions by saying it's ""for the greater good.""It would've been a hell of a tweak if 24 this time took place in, say, Duluth, Minnesota or Ogden, Utah. But no, the writers don't go out on that limb. New York is the new C.T.U. setting, and the only familiar presence there is social sandpaper Chloe O'Brian. Intriguing new faces at C.T.U. consist of Mykelti Williamson as the sorta slimy new C.T.U. Director, Katee Sackhoff as a secretive (and hot!) systems analyst, and Freddie Prinze, Jr. as square-jawed C.T.U. agent Cole Ortiz. Cherry Jones (""President Allison Taylor"") and Annie Wersching (""Renee Walker"") return to meaty roles, with Wersching's scarred Agent Walker in some instances out-Bauering Jack Bauer. It's a sight to behold when even Jack thinks Renee had gone too far.But if you thought that Jack was extreme before, he really goes off the reservation in this one. Kiefer is so intense and still so underrated as an actor. We follow multiple story arcs going on simultaneously, and I'll admit to initially scoffing at Katee Sackhoff's narrative. For the first half of the season, I was dismissing her arc as contrived and unnecessary. But then something happens...I've become converted to waiting to watch my television shows until the complete season DVDs come out. 24, with its complex multi-layered plotting, is best taken in when you could it tune in back to back to back. Season 8 is thrilling and action-packed and cautionary. It provokes thought and debate, from Presidents Taylor and Hassan's character arcs to Jack Bauer's controversial stand. 24 doesn't rest on its laurels. It's addictive to the end.24 episodes on six discs with the following bonus material: ""The Ultimate C.T.U."" - a featurette going into the show's relocation to New York and the impressive set designs for the New York-based C.T.U. (00:12:51 minutes); 7 Extended Episodes; Deleted Scenes, including one in which Renee tells Chloe why she never called Jack back when he was recuperating; ""Scenemakers"" - a series of 2 minutes-plus technical footage giving behind-the-scene looks at key stunts/special effects sequences in 21 episodes (the rocket launcher scene, the motorcade save, etc.); and ""Virtually New York"" - this segment explores the tech involved (mostly digital compositing) in delivering a consistent and convincing looking New York City (00:09:09).

The beginning story of her and Kevin? That was not needed at all. It wasn't strong enough and I couldn't help but think about one thing: Dana, you're a CTU Agent. You have too much pull to let some two-bit low life back you up into the corner.That right there let me know that something fishy was going on. However, all of that wasn't needed.And um...when the hell do they plan on finding that dead PO in CTU? Did they forget about that?I really wanted President Hassan to make it and my heart nearly broke in two when they found him dead. But wasn't that scene played out exactly like in Season 3 when they were trying to find that guy responsible for the virus? Yep.I found a lot of this season's ideals repetitive and so it was much harder to watch the first half than the last. After that, this show rocked! I was on the edge of my seat the rest of the way.  After Renee got shot, I thought, ""This is it. Jack's about to lose it."" I was right. But I wasn't expecting his ass to go THAT hard... Just when I thought I knew what Bauer was capable of, he has amazed me once more when he went rogue and killed all of those Russians(with the exception of the Russian President he almost sniped).

Jack is back and in the beginning hejust wants to go home with his family (Kim, her husband and his cute grand daughter). A lot had happened since the lastseason and Jack is fortunately cured (we could not imagine). Now, in New York he's facing a new threat by terrorists from a country ""something"" like Iran (it is been altered for television reason not to mention Iran directly) so they changed it to the Republic of Kamistan.Their prime minister Omar Hassan is negotiated a peace treaty between their countries, also involves a third party: Russia.We all remember President Yuri Suvarov from the fifth season and ""bad man"" former president Charles Logan will also return for this final season: and something will be final for him, too.As Jack uncovers the whole plot behind the killing of his partner and relationship: Agent Rene Walker (Anne Wirsching) he gone beserk. He's following the people behind the assassination, torturing them and finally killing them all.Until one point in this season he is against everybody: even President Taylor (but for good reasons). Otherwise nothing justifies the carnage he executes!Taylor is extremely manipulated by Charles Logan, who's willing to make this peace agreement happen, at all costs.Watching this final season shows some old friends again, like Chloe (she has some vital scenes with Jack), Kim Bauer (unfortunately only some scence with this beauty, but ok. many scences in the previous seasons where really boring sometimes: nobody runs that bad luck all the time!!)Tony Almeida is never present in the eighth season, recalling the amount of body parts he's left in the last seasons, he's in prison this time for sure...But Jack does similar in this, he's really a madman who wants revenge at all costs, even he is unwilling to see or admit it.In the end you always thinking is this really wrong what Jack does or is it justice. Well, first of all this is a televison drama, so not for real. But sometimes it seems like a big computer game and you are Jack Bauer.Don't get me wrong, but what Jack does is not right! Finally the President makes up her mind and does the right thing at the end, Jack gets finally shot by a killing squad, but Taylor saves him the last second.Sometimes this episode is a little bit like season 5, because of many Logan scences in the second half, otherwise Jack Bauer is on the run again, with no hope of getting away with all the crimes, he commited in his rage...At the end Chloe and he look at each other (he in New York somewhere/she at the CTU New York) with a videoline/camera, he thanks her for stopping this maniac tour before it's too late. Chloe cries and wishes him good look and for the first and last time the clock is seen and runs backwards: 003 ... 002 ... 001The end of 24 !jw",4,"The End, unfortunately but this time Jack's loosing it, really!!",1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,2896,"['Beware', 'Spoilers', 'review', 'first', 'ironically', 'not', 'too', 'sad', 'really', 'final', '8th', 'season', '24', 'Jack', 'back', 'beginning', 'hejust', 'go', 'home', 'family', 'Kim', 'husband', 'cute', 'grand', 'daughter', 'lot', 'had', 'happened', 'lastseason', 'Jack', 'fortunately', 'cured', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'Now', 'New', 'York', 'facing', 'new', 'threat', 'terrorists', 'country', 'something', 'Iran', 'been', 'altered', 'television', 'reason', 'not', 'mention', 'Iran', 'directly', 'changed', 'Republic', 'Kamistan.Their', 'prime', 'minister', 'Omar', 'Hassan', 'negotiated', 'peace', 'treaty', 'countries', 'also', 'third', 'party', 'Russia.We', 'remember', 'President', 'Yuri', 'Suvarov', 'fifth', 'season', 'bad', 'man', 'former', 'president', 'Charles', 'Logan', 'will', 'also', 'return', 'final', 'season', 'something', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'Jack', 'whole', 'plot', 'killing', 'partner', 'relationship', 'Agent', 'Rene', 'Walker', 'Anne', 'Wirsching', 'gone', 'beserk', 'following', 'people', 'assassination', 'torturing', 'finally', 'killing', 'all.Until', 'one', 'point', 'season', 'everybody', 'even', 'President', 'Taylor', 'good', 'reasons', 'Otherwise', 'nothing', 'carnage', 'Taylor', 'extremely', 'manipulated', 'Charles', 'Logan', 'who', 'willing', 'make', 'peace', 'agreement', 'happen', 'costs.Watching', 'final', 'season', 'old', 'friends', 'again', 'Chloe', 'vital', 'scenes', 'Jack', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'scence', 'beauty', 'ok.', 'many', 'scences', 'previous', 'seasons', 'where', 'really', 'boring', 'sometimes', 'nobody', 'bad', 'luck', 'time', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'never', 'present', 'eighth', 'season', 'recalling', 'amount', 'body', 'parts', 'left', 'last', 'seasons', 'prison', 'time', 'sure', 'Jack', 'similar', 'really', 'madman', 'who', 'revenge', 'costs', 'even', 'unwilling', 'see', 'admit', 'end', 'always', 'thinking', 'really', 'wrong', 'what', 'Jack', 'justice', 'Well', 'first', 'televison', 'drama', 'not', 'real', 'big', 'computer', 'game', 'are', 'Jack', 'Bauer.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'what', 'Jack', 'not', 'right', 'Finally', 'President', 'up', 'mind', 'right', 'thing', 'end', 'Jack', 'finally', 'shot', 'killing', 'squad', 'Taylor', 'last', 'second.Sometimes', 'episode', 'little', 'bit', 'season', '5', 'many', 'Logan', 'scences', 'second', 'half', 'otherwise', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'run', 'again', 'hope', 'getting', 'away', 'crimes', 'commited', 'rage', 'end', 'Chloe', 'look', 'other', 'New', 'York', 'somewhere/she', 'CTU', 'New', 'York', 'videoline/camera', 'stopping', 'maniac', 'tour', 'too', 'late', 'Chloe', 'cries', 'wishes', 'good', 'look', 'first', 'last', 'time', 'clock', 'seen', 'backwards', '003', '002', '001The', 'end', '24', 'jw']",24: Season 8

Season eight of ""24"" holds the excitement and drama that the previous seven seasons were known for.  This is and was the best show on TV.  Some shows stick around too long, but even in season eight, ""24"" has twists and turns in the plot that leave your jaw dropping in amazement.Season eight begins with an all new CTU (in New York), with Jack Bauer in quiet retirement.  It changes drastically from episode one on!  The plot revolves around a terrorist plan to use fuel rods as a weapon on US soil.  There is constant intrigue involving the middle eastern country which purchased the fuel rods (the I.R.K.), the Russian sellers, and CTU desperately trying to intercept the transaction and stop deployment of the rods.  On the political front, there is intense pressure for the US to sigh a peace treaty with both Russia and the I.R.K.  President Allison Taylor faces her greatest moral challenge, and this becomes a major theme of the season.  Season eight also brings the surprising return of former disgraced President Charles Logan.  His ""Nixon-like"" character represents the worst of American power, dirty politics, and moral failure.  In contrast, the role of CTU analyst Chloe O'Brian represents the best qualities of loyalty, friendship, and intellect.My only criticism of this season is the tendency to turn Jack Bauer into a superhero character. The things he is able to accomplish on his own are simply too much to believe. That aside, this final season of ""24"" will leave you in tears, as we say goodbye to the best show on television. With the rise of the mindless reality shows on TV, one wonders if the industry has any interest in creating further quality television as exemplified in ""24"".kone",5,"A heartfelt ""Goodbye"" to the Best Show on Television",1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,1866,"['eight', 'seasons', '24', 'was', 'easily', 'most', 'riveting', 'show', 'television', 'surprisingly', 'quality', 'usual', 'mindless', 'fare', 'presented', 'boob', 'tube', 'Season', 'eight', '24', 'excitement', 'drama', 'previous', 'seven', 'seasons', 'were', 'known', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'TV', 'shows', 'stick', 'around', 'too', 'long', 'even', 'season', 'eight', '24', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'leave', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'amazement.Season', 'eight', 'begins', 'new', 'CTU', 'New', 'York', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'quiet', 'retirement', 'drastically', 'episode', 'one', 'plot', 'around', 'terrorist', 'plan', 'use', 'fuel', 'rods', 'weapon', 'US', 'soil', 'constant', 'intrigue', 'involving', 'middle', 'eastern', 'country', 'purchased', 'fuel', 'rods', 'I.R.K', 'Russian', 'sellers', 'CTU', 'desperately', 'trying', 'intercept', 'transaction', 'stop', 'deployment', 'rods', 'political', 'front', 'intense', 'pressure', 'US', 'sigh', 'peace', 'treaty', 'Russia', 'I.R.K', 'President', 'Allison', 'Taylor', 'greatest', 'moral', 'challenge', 'major', 'theme', 'season', 'Season', 'eight', 'also', 'surprising', 'return', 'former', 'disgraced', 'President', 'Charles', 'Logan', 'Nixon-like', 'character', 'worst', 'American', 'power', 'dirty', 'politics', 'moral', 'failure', 'contrast', 'role', 'CTU', 'analyst', 'Chloe', ""O'Brian"", 'best', 'qualities', 'loyalty', 'friendship', 'only', 'criticism', 'season', 'tendency', 'turn', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'superhero', 'character', 'things', 'able', 'accomplish', 'own', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'believe', 'aside', 'final', 'season', '24', 'will', 'leave', 'tears', 'say', 'goodbye', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'rise', 'mindless', 'reality', 'TV', 'one', 'wonders', 'industry', 'interest', 'creating', 'further', 'quality', 'television', 'exemplified', '24', '.kone']",24: Season 8

1299634,A2CYWAKMIATB56,B002ZCY7SW,"Leopold Stotch ""Butters""","[169, 197]","I came into this season expecting it to be the last. Fox had long maligned the fact that '24' was very expensive to make. They also cited lagging ratings (mostly due to the lackluster season 6 leaving a bad taste in viewers mouths and the WGA strike making the show almost irrelevant.) as a reason to ax the show. And besides, the concept was becoming a bit outdated. Even the tenor of season 8, with the world standing on the brink of an historic peace agreement, signified that 24 was coming full circle. The idea that peace could exist in a world of espionage and paranoia such as the one 24 dwelled in, was a big step toward a brave new world. The kind of thing you see when a show wants to go out with a bang. I was ready for it to end and am sad to see it go. The Machiavellian exploits of Jack Bauer have been must see television from Day One (November 6,2001) in my household. On Tuesdays at 9pm (Seasons 1-3) and Mondays at 9pm (Seasons 4-8), no one was allowed to bother me. I loved this show. As for season 8;The first half really was tough to swallow. After seeing Doug Hutchison on Lost as a hippie running the Dharma Initiative, I really had trouble buying the Russian Merc angle. His accent was horrible. Davros really bothered me. Strike 1. Katee Sackhoff's character Dana Walsh was one of the most annoying main character in the history of the series (Marilyn Bauer really bugged me). Brian Hastings was a major tool. ANd I am sorry, I just can't take Freddie Prinze, Jr. seriously. Not all of the casting was bad, though. We did get Michael Madsen, Jurgen Prochnow, and David Anders this year. But for not nearly enough time. These actors were too good for the short arcs and cheap exits they made, especially in Anders case.The plot was pretty straight forward until the fuel rods came into play. Then I was slightly annoyed. Arabs with Russian supplied nukes? AGAIN?! The stench of season 6 began to waft upward.But, then, Omar Hassan died and the Russians took center stage and committed the worst mistake ever; killing girl Jack (Renee). Jack went off the deep end. And the series really caught fire again. Those last seven episodes of Jack acting as judge, jury, and executioner really made me think a ninth season would not be all that bad.In the end, everyone stood accountable for their mistakes. And Jack was given time to run. The final goodbye with Chloe was poignant. The long last look up was, too. And then the clock reached zero on one of the more ground breaking and innovative series of this or any generation. It was so ground breaking, it could only copy itself (and did so a lot in season 8).Now that this show is done, I am done with network TV. Really, how could anything top this show and Lost? So, it's the end of an era. Thank you, 24, for making it enjoyable.",5,A fitting end,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,2803,"['came', 'season', 'expecting', 'be', 'last', 'Fox', 'had', 'long', 'maligned', 'fact', ""'24"", 'was', 'very', 'expensive', 'make', 'also', 'cited', 'lagging', 'ratings', 'mostly', 'due', 'lackluster', 'season', '6', 'leaving', 'bad', 'taste', 'viewers', 'mouths', 'WGA', 'strike', 'making', 'show', 'almost', 'irrelevant', 'reason', 'ax', 'show', 'concept', 'was', 'becoming', 'bit', 'outdated', 'Even', 'tenor', 'season', '8', 'world', 'standing', 'brink', 'historic', 'peace', 'agreement', 'signified', '24', 'was', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'idea', 'peace', 'could', 'exist', 'world', 'espionage', 'paranoia', 'such', 'one', '24', 'dwelled', 'was', 'big', 'step', 'brave', 'new', 'world', 'kind', 'thing', 'see', 'when', 'show', 'go', 'out', 'bang', 'was', 'ready', 'end', 'am', 'sad', 'see', 'go', 'Machiavellian', 'exploits', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'have', 'been', 'must', 'see', 'television', 'Day', 'One', 'November', '6,2001', 'household', 'Tuesdays', '9pm', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'Mondays', '9pm', 'Seasons', '4-8', 'one', 'was', 'allowed', 'bother', 'loved', 'show', 'season', '8', 'first', 'half', 'really', 'was', 'tough', 'swallow', 'seeing', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'Lost', 'hippie', 'running', 'Dharma', 'Initiative', 'really', 'had', 'trouble', 'buying', 'Russian', 'Merc', 'angle', 'accent', 'was', 'horrible', 'Davros', 'really', 'bothered', 'Strike', '1', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'character', 'Dana', 'Walsh', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'main', 'character', 'history', 'series', 'Marilyn', 'Bauer', 'really', 'bugged', 'Brian', 'Hastings', 'was', 'major', 'tool', 'am', 'sorry', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'seriously', 'Not', 'casting', 'was', 'bad', 'though', 'did', 'get', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'David', 'Anders', 'year', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'time', 'actors', 'were', 'too', 'good', 'short', 'arcs', 'cheap', 'exits', 'made', 'especially', 'Anders', 'case.The', 'plot', 'was', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'fuel', 'rods', 'came', 'play', 'Then', 'was', 'slightly', 'annoyed', 'Arabs', 'Russian', 'supplied', 'nukes', 'AGAIN', 'stench', 'season', '6', 'began', 'waft', 'upward.But', 'then', 'Omar', 'Hassan', 'died', 'Russians', 'took', 'center', 'stage', 'committed', 'worst', 'mistake', 'ever', 'killing', 'girl', 'Jack', 'Renee', 'Jack', 'went', 'deep', 'end', 'series', 'really', 'caught', 'fire', 'again', 'last', 'seven', 'episodes', 'Jack', 'acting', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'really', 'made', 'think', 'ninth', 'season', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'bad.In', 'end', 'everyone', 'stood', 'accountable', 'mistakes', 'Jack', 'was', 'given', 'time', 'run', 'final', 'goodbye', 'Chloe', 'was', 'poignant', 'long', 'last', 'look', 'up', 'was', 'too', 'then', 'clock', 'reached', 'zero', 'one', 'more', 'ground', 'breaking', 'innovative', 'series', 'generation', 'was', 'so', 'ground', 'breaking', 'could', 'only', 'copy', 'did', 'so', 'lot', 'season', '8', '.Now', 'show', 'done', 'am', 'done', 'network', 'TV', 'Really', 'how', 'could', 'anything', 'top', 'show', 'Lost', 'So', 'end', 'era', 'Thank', '24', 'making', 'enjoyable']",24: Season 8

1299645,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZCY7SW,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","While I didn't jump on with the first season, I became a major fan of the series ""24"". It took all the elements of the best action films, spy films and thrillers and put them not just on the screen in one show but in real time format as well.Real time format means that the show pretty much takes place in actual time. I mean come on; real time doesn't pause for a commercial break so it wasn't exact. But the fact that it took place in real time added to the cliffhanger mode that it clicked on, each week ending with something that wouldn't be solved or corrected until the following week, each episode ending with the digital clock counting down the last few seconds of the hour.Kieffer Sutherland shone as CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) agent Jack Bauer. In a world gone mad where terrorists hijack planes to fly into buildings, there was a need for an agent like Bauer. The suave and sophisticated James Bond could manipulate women to assist him in finding out a bad guy's secrets over time. Bauer and a pair of pliers could find the same information out in moments. Yes it was cruel, yes it was torture but in today's world while we talked about how we should treat people humanely secretly many folks were hoping that a real life Jack Bauer existed to insure the safety of our country.Along with a continuing cast of regulars who either stuck with the show or found themselves cannon fodder for the latest bad guy, all did an exceptional job as well. While Bauer was the focus of the show the supporting casts were family members we grew to love and cherish and cry for when they ended up killed by terrorist's gas or bomb attacks.This brings us to ""24 Season eight"". This was the last season of the series. It brought a close to the world of 24 and of Jack Bauer. Promises have been made that Bauer will return in feature film form minus the real time element. Fans are waiting anxiously. But it is this final season after the show was canceled (due to the cost of production and dropping ratings) that has just now reached DVD.Season Eight begins with President Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones) about to sign a peace agreement with the Islamic Republic of Kamistan, a Middle Eastern country, that could solve the problem there for everyone. It would be a first step that would cause others to think and consider the benefits that would outweigh the problems that lie between the countries there. But not everyone wants peace to happen. Die hard fanatics rarely seek out peace and always think their way is the best.Attacks and kidnapping attempts on President Omar Hassan (Anil Kapoor) of the I.R.K. bring Jack Bauer back to take on the bad guys. Once again he's tried to leave behind the life that nearly destroyed him and did take the life of his wife. As he is about to leave and head out west with his daughter and her family, duty calls once more and only Jack can save the world from total annihilation.Tossed into this plot is a mole (a traitor hidden in the organization) in the new CTU. For some reason this organization that is supposed to protect us always had room for one mole or another nearly every episode. This time around the mole is offering information to the kidnappers. Its just one more thing Jack will have to deal with as he races to save the world in just 24 hours.CTU is different with a new man in charge, Brian Hastings (Mykelti Williamson), who seems to completely miss the abilities and assistance that could be afforded by Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), the computer genius and perhaps the only best friend of Bauer still alive. Each time her advice is ignored more trouble follows until the new director finally discovers how valuable she truly is leaving us something at the series end to consider.New characters arrive to help the story along, old characters make reappearances as they try to gain power once more and through it all Jack Bauer scrambles to save the day in spite of politically motivated bureaucrats more concerned with their stations of power or planned dreams than of making this country safe. The most recent elections as well as numerous polls make one believe that many in this country don't find many politicians to trust these days and if they're anything like those found here it's understandable why.The final season, known as day 8, offers everything that fans have come to love. It has a problem that only the hero can solve and then twists and turns several times over before the real problem or difficulty is seen. And that makes for an enjoyable ride as we go along with Jack to find the solution, the bad guy, the way to save the world.As season eight comes to a close, we're left with one burning question. With Jack Bauer gone, who will we turn to now to save the day?",5,FAREWELL 24,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,4744,"['did', ""n't"", 'jump', 'first', 'season', 'became', 'major', 'fan', 'series', '24', 'took', 'elements', 'best', 'action', 'films', 'spy', 'films', 'thrillers', 'put', 'not', 'just', 'screen', 'one', 'show', 'real', 'time', 'format', 'well.Real', 'time', 'format', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'place', 'actual', 'time', 'mean', 'come', 'real', 'time', ""n't"", 'pause', 'commercial', 'break', 'was', ""n't"", 'exact', 'fact', 'took', 'place', 'real', 'time', 'added', 'cliffhanger', 'mode', 'clicked', 'week', 'ending', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'solved', 'corrected', 'following', 'week', 'episode', 'ending', 'digital', 'clock', 'counting', 'down', 'last', 'few', 'seconds', 'hour.Kieffer', 'Sutherland', 'shone', 'CTU', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'world', 'gone', 'mad', 'where', 'terrorists', 'hijack', 'planes', 'fly', 'buildings', 'was', 'need', 'agent', 'Bauer', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'James', 'Bond', 'could', 'manipulate', 'women', 'assist', 'finding', 'out', 'bad', 'guy', 'secrets', 'time', 'Bauer', 'pair', 'pliers', 'could', 'find', 'same', 'information', 'moments', 'Yes', 'was', 'cruel', 'yes', 'was', 'torture', 'today', 'world', 'talked', 'how', 'should', 'treat', 'people', 'humanely', 'secretly', 'many', 'folks', 'were', 'hoping', 'real', 'life', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'existed', 'insure', 'safety', 'country.Along', 'continuing', 'cast', 'regulars', 'who', 'stuck', 'show', 'found', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'latest', 'bad', 'guy', 'did', 'exceptional', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'Bauer', 'was', 'focus', 'show', 'supporting', 'casts', 'were', 'family', 'members', 'grew', 'love', 'cherish', 'cry', 'when', 'ended', 'up', 'killed', 'terrorist', 'gas', 'bomb', 'attacks.This', '24', 'Season', 'eight', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'series', 'brought', 'close', 'world', '24', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Promises', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Bauer', 'will', 'return', 'feature', 'film', 'form', 'real', 'time', 'element', 'Fans', 'are', 'waiting', 'anxiously', 'final', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', 'due', 'cost', 'production', 'dropping', 'ratings', 'just', 'now', 'reached', 'DVD.Season', 'Eight', 'President', 'Allison', 'Taylor', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'sign', 'peace', 'agreement', 'Islamic', 'Republic', 'Kamistan', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'country', 'could', 'solve', 'problem', 'there', 'everyone', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'step', 'would', 'cause', 'others', 'think', 'consider', 'benefits', 'would', 'outweigh', 'problems', 'lie', 'countries', 'there', 'not', 'everyone', 'peace', 'happen', 'Die', 'hard', 'fanatics', 'rarely', 'seek', 'out', 'peace', 'always', 'think', 'way', 'best.Attacks', 'kidnapping', 'attempts', 'President', 'Omar', 'Hassan', 'Anil', 'Kapoor', 'I.R.K', 'bring', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'back', 'take', 'bad', 'guys', 'Once', 'again', 'tried', 'leave', 'life', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'did', 'take', 'life', 'wife', 'leave', 'head', 'out', 'west', 'daughter', 'family', 'duty', 'once', 'more', 'only', 'Jack', 'can', 'save', 'world', 'total', 'annihilation.Tossed', 'plot', 'mole', 'traitor', 'hidden', 'organization', 'new', 'CTU', 'reason', 'organization', 'supposed', 'protect', 'always', 'had', 'room', 'one', 'mole', 'nearly', 'episode', 'time', 'mole', 'offering', 'information', 'kidnappers', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'Jack', 'will', 'have', 'deal', 'save', 'world', 'just', '24', 'hours.CTU', 'different', 'new', 'man', 'charge', 'Brian', 'Hastings', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'who', 'completely', 'miss', 'abilities', 'assistance', 'could', 'be', 'afforded', 'Chloe', ""O'Brian"", 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'computer', 'genius', 'perhaps', 'only', 'best', 'friend', 'Bauer', 'still', 'alive', 'time', 'advice', 'ignored', 'more', 'trouble', 'new', 'director', 'finally', 'how', 'valuable', 'truly', 'leaving', 'something', 'series', 'end', 'consider.New', 'characters', 'arrive', 'help', 'story', 'old', 'characters', 'make', 'reappearances', 'try', 'gain', 'power', 'once', 'more', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'scrambles', 'save', 'day', 'spite', 'politically', 'motivated', 'bureaucrats', 'more', 'concerned', 'stations', 'power', 'planned', 'dreams', 'making', 'country', 'safe', 'most', 'recent', 'elections', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'polls', 'make', 'one', 'believe', 'many', 'country', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'many', 'politicians', 'trust', 'days', ""'re"", 'anything', 'found', 'here', 'understandable', 'why.The', 'final', 'season', 'known', 'day', '8', 'offers', 'everything', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'problem', 'only', 'hero', 'can', 'solve', 'then', 'twists', 'several', 'times', 'real', 'problem', 'difficulty', 'seen', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'go', 'along', 'Jack', 'find', 'solution', 'bad', 'guy', 'way', 'save', 'world.As', 'season', 'eight', 'close', ""'re"", 'left', 'one', 'burning', 'question', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'gone', 'who', 'will', 'turn', 'now', 'save', 'day']",24: Season 8
1299646,A3LA1L1TUXV9TN,B002ZCY7SW,Martin R. Lash,"[0, 0]","I just finished watching all 192 episodes of 24. This was a project that took a lot of time but worth it. I am not sure why I missed it when it was on TV but I am glad it is available on DVD and I have been able to watch it on my own time. Likely I would have missed episodes when it was on TV. The series had great and weak seasons. I think season 1 and 8 are great. The 5th is exceptional. They say season 6 was weak. I guess so but you can see they still put a lot into it. I can see the complaints about torture. Some of it is very violent and gruesome. I think the use of chemical torture was really uncomfortable to watch. This also reminds me of how many have been complaining that Zero Dark 30 endorses torture. I don't think it did nor do I think 24 did. But, that is my opinion. What I do think was representable was their suggestion that those who are Muslims or Middle-Eastern are terrorists. They fixed that in the later seasons, especially season 8.  In any event I found Kiefer Sutherland to be electrifying throughout every season. His relentless energy and ability to emotionally and physically act at that level is astonishing. He is a great actor. There were many others I greatly admired especially the weird and wonderful Mary Lynn Rajskub. She became a important part of the show. She seemed never comfortable with herself. Her strange expressions were what made her priceless. I guess my regret is that they killed off so many and some in the same seasons. I never got why they did that. Jack had a lot of great, beautiful women but the poor guy could never get a break. Bad things happened to the three that really meant something. I thought of all of them that Annie Wersching as Renee Walker was breathtaking. I also wish to point out that back in 2001 the show had black president. Not just any black president but a commanding Dennis Haysberth in that role. Then in series 7 and 8 they had Cherry Jones as the first female president.

Technically, it was a monstrous achievment. To make a whole show wiht lots and lots of location shooting in New York without the actor even getting near New York was outstanding and very rare for a TV show. This must have been indeed one of the costlier prime time TV shows ever.However, there was something, let's say, weird here. Let's go:a. Kate Sackhoff: as annoying as she was in Galactica. Also, how, HOW someone with a past criminal record can simply forge a new identity and get a high-position job at CTU?! Well, like I said begfore, this seems honest to the premises of the show... IN all the seasons, CTU seemed easier to infiltrate than to assault a candy store...b. Hastings: one of the best CTU leaders ever, was sacked from the show.c. Jack's killing spree: that was annoying, really annoying. But people seem to think it was all because the murder of Rene Walker, but it was not. The trigger that made him go crazy (more crazy, I mean) was the President of the United States ordering him arrested to cover a conspiracy. That was the last straw for a man who did everything in his powers ever to help the US. Anyway, not a good sight. Come one, eviscerating a man?! Also, is the guy a surgeon? He rapidly got the chip the guy had swallowed!d. Logan: you think the guy would be redeemed, but turn into pure evil. And, also, he killed his faithfull assistant (Jason Pillar) for the sake of absolutely nothing!e. In the end, the central character can not even finish the show in a reasonable manner that would indicate he had the possibility of a normal life. No. How has become standards for todays dramas shows, the main character must suffer, otherwise the show is not good... Sad..Good things:a. Freddy Prinze Jr.: I think his Cole Ortiz was good.b.

All the episodes of all previous seasons are riveting for those who are wondering how jack is going to get out of each 60-minute jam. This season was probably better than most in that regard. But as with the plots in the comic books, there are some VERY improbable explainations for how things unfold. And MANY instances of sloppy detective work when it's convenient for plot development. But this season was extraordinary in that the villain was realistic/true to world conditions. In past seasons, the villains were birthed out of Hollywood (re liberal) wishes that big oil, splinter militia groups, or deranged former military (scads of them) are the reason for all the terrorist threats across the planet. This season, the source of vast resources for mass destruction was creditable. It takes a lot of firepower and expertise to keep jack and the nation on the brink of disaster for 24 hours.

1299652,A1WXG10FJ353K0,B002ZCY7SW,MickeyJoe,"[1, 2]","Hard to believe it took almost a decade to get through a week of Jack's life.  But what a wild ride.  Though it's the final season, it still lives on in our imagination.  We are left accepting the fate of our hero, and we're okay with it. We also assume CTU is continued being run by someone we have grown to love as they inherit the unexpected role. The political aspect is left up in the air as we have no idea what direction the administration will go. But we know we can never trust any politician, we must control them.The people we lost along the way have really added up, but we all felt such a loss of a special one near the end leaving a magnitude of heartache.  We would have expected that person to live and that's why losing them makes perfect sense.  It was a desperate act of devotion to the good and love of the country. But a satisfying result in every angle of the story.Some highlight performances come from Necar Zadegan as Dalia, ready to become Evita 2. As well as the surprise appearance of Mare Winningham with an instant thought to the ""brat pack"", but soon throws out all 80's nostalgia with a brilliant performance at 2:00am that is frightening, exciting and heart-wrenching all at once. She appears in one episode that was better than many full length movies.  Mare proves that Hollywood better wake up to her wasted talent. Both deserved at least an Emmy nomination. The only distracting part of this season is Freddie Prinze Jr.. Luckily the story and rest of the cast overpower his ""acting"". It also did not help that the make-up artist must have graduated from clown school. Prize's face is so white, he was almost as ghostly as Michael Jackson. But, I just continued accepting his face and lack of delivery. There's is no Chico left in the kid.The best part of the series is the writing.  Each episode usually has a different Director and writers.  It is what kept the show fresh and unpredictable.  When you feel like you are part of the cast,they must be doing something right.*  Jack Bauer: You detonate that vest, your mother dies too.*  Marcos Al-Zacar: What did you say?*  Jack Bauer: You heard me. I'm gonna make sure your mother's in Manhattan when that dirty bomb goes off.*  Marcos Al-Zacar: You don't even know what the target is.*  Jack Bauer: I'm not talking about her dying during the explosion. I'm gonna personally escort her to the blast site so she's exposed to the radiation.*  Marcos Al-Zacar: I don't believe you. You wouldn't do that. You're a federal agent.*  Jack Bauer: Truth is, I'm not, really. Well, not any more. I'm more of a specialist that they brought in for today. If you knew who I was and the things I've done before in my life, you would know that I'm not bluffing. So go ahead; blow yourself up into a million little pieces, first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make your mother come in here and clean it up. Then I'm gonna take her to the blast site. Do you know how long it takes the human body to absorb a lethal dose of cesium-137? Five seconds, followed by twelve days of pain that is so agonizing, morphine can't even touch it. You got a decision to make, make it carefully.*  Marcos Al-Zacar: You're not gonna hurt my mother.*  Jack Bauer: I'm done playing with you. You will look into my eyes. Look at my eyes! You think I'm joking? What happens to your mother is because of you. Only you.*  Marcos Al-Zacar: If I open the door and I come out; do you promise you won't hurt her? You promise to leave her alone?*  Jack Bauer: I give you my word.When Jack Bauer gives his word, failure to keep his word is not an option.  He will certainly be missed, but we leave him trusting he is in a much deserved better place.Bravo!",5,You don't know Jack,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,3698,"['Hard', 'believe', 'took', 'almost', 'decade', 'get', 'week', 'Jack', 'life', 'what', 'wild', 'ride', 'final', 'season', 'still', 'imagination', 'are', 'left', 'accepting', 'fate', 'hero', ""'re"", 'okay', 'also', 'assume', 'CTU', 'continued', 'being', 'run', 'someone', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'inherit', 'unexpected', 'role', 'political', 'aspect', 'left', 'up', 'air', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'direction', 'administration', 'will', 'go', 'know', 'can', 'never', 'trust', 'politician', 'must', 'control', 'them.The', 'people', 'lost', 'way', 'have', 'really', 'added', 'up', 'felt', 'such', 'loss', 'special', 'one', 'end', 'leaving', 'magnitude', 'heartache', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'person', 'live', 'why', 'losing', 'perfect', 'sense', 'was', 'desperate', 'act', 'devotion', 'good', 'love', 'country', 'satisfying', 'result', 'angle', 'story.Some', 'highlight', 'performances', 'come', 'Necar', 'Zadegan', 'Dalia', 'ready', 'become', 'Evita', '2', 'As', 'well', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'instant', 'thought', 'brat', 'pack', 'soon', 'out', '80', 'nostalgia', 'brilliant', 'performance', '2:00am', 'frightening', 'exciting', 'heart-wrenching', 'once', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'better', 'many', 'full', 'length', 'movies', 'Mare', 'Hollywood', 'better', 'wake', 'up', 'wasted', 'talent', 'deserved', 'least', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'only', 'distracting', 'part', 'season', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr..', 'Luckily', 'story', 'rest', 'cast', 'overpower', 'acting', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'make-up', 'artist', 'must', 'have', 'graduated', 'clown', 'school', 'Prize', 'face', 'so', 'white', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'ghostly', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'just', 'continued', 'accepting', 'face', 'lack', 'delivery', 'Chico', 'left', 'kid.The', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'writing', 'episode', 'usually', 'different', 'Director', 'writers', 'what', 'kept', 'show', 'fresh', 'unpredictable', 'When', 'feel', 'are', 'part', 'cast', 'must', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'right', '*', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'detonate', 'vest', 'mother', 'too', '*', 'Marcos', 'Al-Zacar', 'What', 'did', 'say', '*', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'heard', ""'m"", 'gon', 'make', 'sure', 'mother', 'Manhattan', 'when', 'bomb', 'off', '*', 'Marcos', 'Al-Zacar', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'target', '*', 'Jack', 'Bauer', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'dying', 'explosion', ""'m"", 'gon', 'personally', 'escort', 'blast', 'site', 'exposed', 'radiation', '*', 'Marcos', 'Al-Zacar', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', ""'re"", 'federal', 'agent', '*', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Truth', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'Well', 'not', 'more', ""'m"", 'more', 'specialist', 'brought', 'today', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done', 'life', 'would', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'bluffing', 'So', 'go', 'ahead', 'blow', 'up', 'million', 'little', 'pieces', 'first', 'thing', ""'m"", 'gon', 'do', ""'m"", 'gon', 'make', 'mother', 'come', 'here', 'clean', 'up', 'Then', ""'m"", 'gon', 'take', 'blast', 'site', 'Do', 'know', 'how', 'long', 'human', 'body', 'absorb', 'lethal', 'dose', 'cesium-137', 'Five', 'seconds', 'followed', 'twelve', 'days', 'pain', 'so', 'agonizing', 'morphine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'touch', 'got', 'decision', 'make', 'make', 'carefully', '*', 'Marcos', 'Al-Zacar', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'hurt', 'mother', 'Jack', 'Bauer', ""'m"", 'done', 'playing', 'will', 'look', 'eyes', 'Look', 'eyes', 'think', ""'m"", 'joking', 'What', 'mother', 'Only', '*', 'Marcos', 'Al-Zacar', 'open', 'door', 'come', 'out', 'do', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'promise', 'leave', 'alone', '*', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'give', 'word.When', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'word', 'failure', 'keep', 'word', 'not', 'option', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'missed', 'leave', 'trusting', 'much', 'deserved', 'better', 'place.Bravo']",24: Season 8

How wrong I was...The series this time moves to New York, and the main plot concerns a peace treaty between the US, Russia and a fictional Arab nation. Terrorists are determined to halt the treaty by assassinating the Arab President (a superb performance by Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor) before it is signed. Of course, there are the usual twists and turns (though -- thankfully -- nowhere near as many as in season 7), and inevitably the now-retired Jack is brought reluctantly back into the front line to save the day.This isn't so much as a new 24, but a return to the old style. The tension builds slowly as the clock ticks; there is much more emphasis (like the old days) on creating tension than all out drama. Sure, (naturally) lots of dramatic things happen, but it just felt much more balanced, and less OTT than it had become -- like it used to be. That said, though, when things do get hot then it is as explosive and intense as ever. No spoilers, but the last 4 episodes in particular are as good as any season. It's up there with 5 for a breathtaking finale!...The acting, again, is first class (especially the Arabian presidential family, and again Cherry Jones returning as President Taylor). A couple of old ""friends"" turn up during the course and really add to the drama. Kim is also in New York (but doesn't need rescuing this time around!) and Chloe is still struggling to sort out the muddles at CTU! Freddie Prinze Jr. is solid as the new lead CTU field agent Cole Cortez (a little similar to Chase in Season 3). There are a couple of goofy side plots (as always), but they don't detract from the strong central stories which develop (and nothing as bad as Kim's babysitting adventure!...)Personally, my only quibble is (and it's more about the series as a whole than season 8) that I think they shouldn't have overused Nina Meyers in seasons 2 and 3. I think it would have been the perfect ending to the series if they had saved her showdown with Jack till the last act, bringing it full circle to a more natural conclusion. Other than that, this is one of my favourite series, and season 8 one of my favourite 24 seasons. I can't really separate it from 1 and 5 -- they are all brilliant in different ways. 3 was next best then 6, 2, 4 and 7. That's only my opinion, though!...I'm sad that it has finished, but I'm glad it found it's form again before bowing out. Hopefully the film that is planned will be made...

Jack Bauer kicked butt and for the most part the written and the show was well written and the acting was exceptional.  Kiefer Sutherland did an outstanding job playing Jack Bauer for 8 seasons.  He has made Jack an action hero equivalent to James Bond or John McClane.Now about season 8.  The final 3 years weren't the best seasons and the show started to become formulaic.  I feel the writers, network, and producers didn't want to stray too much from what they thought fan's loved.  I would have liked to have seen the show grow, but that is a whole other topic.  This season has some great episodes but the show started to fall in a routine that was becoming annoying.  If the US government is this inept, and it might be, than we are lucky to have a country.  The conspiracies' started to get outrageous.  I started thinking everyone is a spy and CTU is run by a bunch on monkey's, aka bureaucrats, same thing.  It made China, Russia, and everyone else look smarter with better agents than the US. Yes, Jack usually saved the day by hour 24, but they started to create crazy scenarios.  Season 8 continued with the same premise, the US is in danger, about to be attacked and Jack is needed to save the day.  I would think after Season 5 Jack would be treated as a national treasure instead of a liability only called upon when the US needed his help.  OH well, if you can't get over the ridiculous circumstances that the US calls for Jack's aid, you will like this show.  Season 8 was at times rushed and the scenarios a bit exaggerated.  The brought back another KIM type character in Kayla Hassan.  She is beautiful, but you get annoyed by the child like innocence, to the point that you wish someone would just kill her.  I hate the storyline with President Taylor this season.  Such a great character that owes Jack Bauer so much, is willing to do what she does to him.  I feel they took it too far.  They could have written that whole premise is a more plausible manner.  We American's must elect the worse President's.  And President's must pick a bunch of weasels to serve under them.  God help the US is this is true.  I feel 24 took the feel the US was unhappy with our real President Bush, let's see how we can show the American people why it is important to elect someone competent.  Back to this Season, sorry for the tangent, I had to vent.  Several show's this season are too long or useless.  There are 3 season's of 24 that EVERY episode is excellent, see below, or above average.  This isn't one of them.  I say about 3 great hours and 8 good hours, but one fantastic hour is the ending.

1299687,A1DL0EDVWPSPEW,B002ZCY7SW,"Ryan Matthews ""montvil""","[70, 81]","I may be in the few when I say this, but I don't think this show ever qualified as ""past its prime."" It seems like a lot of the reviews coming out from papers, magazines, even fans revolved around the fact that the show ended on a good note, HOWEVER --note the asterisk-- (*it's not what it once was). Yes, there were recurring themes. Yes, we've gone through the whole nuclear weapons story before. Yes, some things were more predictable than they used to be. But I, for one, loved watching Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brian evolve. I loved watching Charles Logan try and wiggle his way back into the good graces of Americans. I loved watching where the shattered life of Tony Almeida led him in Season 7. I think, reasonably so, a lot of people considered the shark jumped after Season 6. I did, too. But I continued watching, and I thought Seasons 7 and 8 were two of the strongest the 24 crew put together.**Spoilers Below**Since I can't rate the product yet, the five stars is for Season 8 itself. It's more of a 4 1/2, but I think they've earned the benefit of the doubt with consistently great work. This season got off to a slow start, much in the same way Season 3 did. Annie Wersching's portrayal of a darker, hardened Renee Walker dominated the early season episodes as a plot was methodically developed. By the twelfth episode, 24 hit its stride in vintage form. The twists and turns were as drastic as ever, and following the assassination of President Omar Hassan of the I.R.K., the show took on an angle it never had before (or at least an altered version of Season Five's anti-terrorism treaty).The blood stained peace treaty among a trio of nations was a different kind of plot for the show, especially since it ironically made Jack Bauer the biggest, not to mention the only legitimate threat in the final third of the season. Noteworthy: You DO NOT kill Jack Bauer's girlfriend. Apparently the Russians didn't hear that from the Chinese (Audrey's alive but status unknown), who in turn didn't hear it from Nina Meyers. I thought it all made perfect sense, because Jack was finally in a good state of mind at the beginning of the season. He was finally getting his life together, he finally stopped playing mind games with his female counterpart. And then Renee Walker gets killed... in Jack's apartment. Jack summed it up best while torturing Pavel. ""Why couldn't you just leave us alone?"" You have to look back on 8 days of professional, and personal, sacrifices Jack has had to make and wonder how it even took him this long to boil over.Jack became the anti-hero, stopping at nothing to eliminate the participants in a treaty based on crime and deceit. For all he's sacrificed for his country, the United States turned its back on Jack Bauer for what they envisioned as ""the greater good."" So when justice by law was refused, Jack took justice into his own hands. What ensued was a bloody mess created by a man who had been betrayed by nearly everyone (NEARLY--thank you, Chloe).Though many would have preferred Bauer to go out in a blaze of glory, gun in hand, I thought the ending was appropriate. For all the times Jack had been spared, whatever the reason, it was only right that the man with 9 lives was granted a 10th. Taylor, in good conscience, couldn't sign the treaty. I'd like to think the video Jack intended for Kim was a tipping point for the President, thus making Jack his own hero, once again. But like the Chinese said at the end of Season 5: ""you're too valuable to kill."" One more time, Jack was given a pass.- My only problem with Season 8 is the Dana Walsh story, and I don't think I'm in the minority here. I was somewhat relieved she became a mole, but it also discredited much of her story earlier in the day. If she had no problem killing Kevin's parole officer, I don't see why she would have a problem killing Kevin. Yes, she had to maintain her cover, and yes, she was on camera when he visited her at CTU, but why not when he and Nick came to her apartment? I'm just a little cloudy as to why Dana was letting those guys push her around. The fact that she was a mole explained further her change of identity, but there were still several holes in her story (not to mention how she got away with wearing a cocktail dress to work.)- As opposed to many fans this season, I had no problem whatsoever with Brian Hastings. Mykelti Williamson was given a very unoriginal role, because we've seen the kind of stubborn, oblivious CTU/Division/Homeland Security directors before on many occasions. However, outside the fact that he looked like a football coach with his earpiece and hunchback way of treading CTU, I thought Hastings was always an interesting, even comical character on screen.- A couple people mentioned in earlier reviews that they found it difficult to take Freddie Prinze, Jr. seriously. I couldn't agree more. He had a steep hill to climb from the reputation he's made for himself since becoming an actor. However, I thought if there was any character in any season of 24 he could've played, Cole Ortiz was the perfect fit; the straight and narrow, by the book, ""boy scout"" if you will, field agent. Though he's certainly not looking at a Primetime Emmy nod for his performance, I thought he did an excellent job with the role.24 still had tricks up its sleeve after 8 seasons. It had some repetition, but still much more originality. It still presented shock value and still produced likable characters. Season 6 may have been sub-par, but was it sub-par as a TV show or was it sub-par by 24 standards? I really think S6 was wrongly tapped as the show's dip into mediocrity. It was just an isolated miss, in my opinion. Honestly, I think the show went out as good as it came in. Now we turn our attention to the big screen.Season 8 | Grade: A-",5,When the country he fought for turned their back on him...,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,5802,"['may', 'be', 'few', 'when', 'say',

But this season is really hard to believe that events occur in real time.  One minute an agent is in the field and 3 minutes later he's back at CTU.  Things like that make it a little more unbelievable to me.  The mole in CTU this season seems like a highly intelligent person one minute and an unstable weakling the next.

1299721,AP3B615GM191G,B002ZCY7SW,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[4, 6]","Besides ""LOST"", ""24"" (before this year) was the only other TV drama I had been able to give 5-stars for every season.  Unfortunately, Season Eight didn't quite live up to that billing, what with a prolonged stretch of dry episodes to start the season and a resolution that seemed more of a film set-up than anything else.  This final season is still entertaining television, and at its best is equal to any of the previous efforts, but it started to show some serious cracks in the veneer this time around.Without spoiling too much of the story arcs for season eight, this cycle begins with ""Grandpa"" Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) once again being sucked into government/political espionage.  Once fully on board, Jack is saddled with such priorities as preventing the assassination of a crucial foreign dignitary, tracking down a shipment of nuclear fuel rods, and finally undermining a government conspiracy that just may prove to be his ultimate undoing.What really hurt this season right from the get-go was two-fold: 1. Uninteresting use of Bauer for the first 12-15 episodes or so (little palpable drama; instead just fights or shoot-outs); and 2. Two new characters, Cole Ortiz (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Dana Walsh (Katee Sackhoff), fail to invigorate the proceedings, and instead actually bog things down with an inane side-plot that doesn't really lead anywhere.Only about half way through the season, when the primary plotline emerges and an ""old friend"" (a very popular recurring cast member from previous seasons) adds some much-needed plot intrigue, does the season really start to take off.  Plus, Jack's relationship with Renee Walker (Annie Wersching) is also fleshed-out quite a bit, leading to some tense emotional drama that will have you on the edge of your seat.Unfortunately, the season comes to a head an episode or so before the big finale, and thus goes out with a bit of a whimper instead of the much-anticipated bang.  Perhaps the writers/producers can't be crucified too heavily for this, as a feature film was already announced to be in the works, but it seemed as if the goal was more ""wrap up this sub-par storyline"" than ""provided a whizz-bang ending to an incredible show"".On a side note, the acting this season is still as compelling as ever.  Prinze Jr. and Sackhoff's characters got a little annoying, but other than that it was one incredible performance after another from such vets as Mary Lynn Rajskub, Cherry Jones, and the ""late-season special guest"".  The on-screen chemistry between Sutherland and Wersching is inspiring as well.Thus, although I am saddened to see ""24"" leave the airwaves after eight grueling, emotional seasons, I am glad that it is getting out of the game now that some serious cracks formed in the structure of the show.  This eighth season, when really rolling, was as good as anything previous, but too often it lacked that ""punch"" that characterized the earlier material.  I will look forward to a potential motion picture (or franchise) to give the Jack Bauer character a much more deserving send-off.",4,Got Out In Time (As Cracks Began To Form),1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,3069,"['LOST', '24', 'year', 'was', 'only', 'other', 'TV', 'drama', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'give', '5-stars', 'season', 'Unfortunately', 'Season', 'Eight', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'billing', 'what', 'prolonged', 'stretch', 'dry', 'episodes', 'start', 'season', 'resolution', 'seemed', 'more', 'film', 'set-up', 'anything', 'else', 'final', 'season', 'still', 'entertaining', 'television', 'best', 'equal', 'previous', 'efforts', 'started', 'show', 'serious', 'cracks', 'veneer', 'time', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'arcs', 'season', 'eight', 'cycle', 'Grandpa', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'once', 'again', 'being', 'sucked', 'government/political', 'espionage', 'Once', 'fully', 'board', 'Jack', 'saddled', 'such', 'priorities', 'preventing', 'assassination', 'crucial', 'foreign', 'dignitary', 'tracking', 'down', 'shipment', 'nuclear', 'fuel', 'rods', 'finally', 'undermining', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'just', 'may', 'prove', 'be', 'ultimate', 'undoing.What', 'really', 'hurt', 'season', 'right', 'get-go', 'was', 'two-fold', '1', 'Uninteresting', 'use', 'Bauer', 'first', '12-15', 'episodes', 'so', 'little', 'palpable', 'drama', 'instead', 'just', 'fights', 'shoot-outs', '2', 'Two', 'new', 'characters', 'Cole', 'Ortiz', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Dana', 'Walsh', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'fail', 'invigorate', 'proceedings', 'instead', 'actually', 'bog', 'things', 'down', 'inane', 'side-plot', ""n't"", 'really', 'lead', 'anywhere.Only', 'half', 'way', 'season', 'when', 'primary', 'plotline', 'emerges', 'old', 'friend', 'very', 'popular', 'recurring', 'cast', 'member', 'previous', 'seasons', 'much-needed', 'plot', 'intrigue', 'season', 'really', 'start', 'take', 'off', 'Jack', 'relationship', 'Renee', 'Walker', 'Annie', 'Wersching', 'also', 'fleshed-out', 'quite', 'bit', 'leading', 'tense', 'emotional', 'drama', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat.Unfortunately', 'season', 'head', 'episode', 'so', 'big', 'finale', 'thus', 'out', 'bit', 'whimper', 'instead', 'much-anticipated', 'bang', 'Perhaps', 'writers/producers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'crucified', 'too', 'heavily', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'announced', 'be', 'works', 'seemed', 'goal', 'was', 'more', 'wrap', 'up', 'sub-par', 'storyline', 'provided', 'whizz-bang', 'ending', 'incredible', 'show', 'side', 'note', 'acting', 'season', 'still', 'as', 'compelling', 'ever', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Sackhoff', 'characters', 'got', 'little', 'annoying', 'other', 'was', 'one', 'incredible', 'performance', 'such', 'vets', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'late-season', 'special', 'guest', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Sutherland', 'Wersching', 'inspiring', 'well.Thus', 'am', 'saddened', 'see', '24', 'leave', 'airwaves', 'eight', 'grueling', 'emotional', 'seasons', 'am', 'glad', 'getting', 'game', 'now', 'serious', 'cracks', 'formed', 'structure', 'show', 'eighth', 'season', 'when', 'really', 'rolling', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'previous', 'too', 'often', 'lacked', 'punch', 'characterized', 'earlier', 'material', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'potential', 'motion', 'picture', 'franchise', 'give', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'deserving', 'send-off']",24: Season 8
