Far from it. The little girl who played Molly- she was exceptional. She conveyed a child's grief and a child's joy with out being phony. All the kids in the movie were wonderful. Whoopi was amazing and she absolutely shone like a star. Ray Liotta played the father but as a real human who makes mistakes along the way but tries his best. The relationship between he and Corrina ( Whoopi) was real and believable and sincere. The relationship between Corrina and Molly was so heartfelt and touching, I could cry just thinking about it. We were all children once. We all have or had mothers. And we can all feel the emotion of this little child who lost her mother and wants that love in her life again.Oh and the music! The music was incredibly important to the flow of the story, from the classic jazz to the commercial jingles to the gorgeous gospel.The underlying heartbreak of racism, bad then in the 50's, still bad now but not quite. Interraccial couples are more and more  ( thankfully) accepted, but how horrible things were then. But the innocence of children... they do not know color, they are taught that. And the movie beautifully expressed that with out being preachy  or heavy handed. We got it. The one scene with Molly and Corrina's niece, when they were sitting outside and Molly asked her if she tasted like chocolate and then the niece asked Molly if she tasted like vanilla, and they licked each other... oh that scene will be with me forever, it was beautiful.There were other scenes all throughout, on so many levels this was a really perfect movie, with so many issues and lessons and was a  movie that treated its audience as smart and able to read between the lines.I recommend this movie so much! stand on your chair and cheer...NO I mean,  stand on your chair and sing!!!!Sing Sing!

370233,AB8J1LJTCJ8LI,6303347665,Amazon Customer,"[4, 4]","I saw this movie when it was first in the theater, and it has been one of my favorites ever since.  It endeared itself to me even more after I saw an interview with Jessie Nelson on TBS' Dinner and a Movie.  This story was based on Nelson's real experience in her early life.  The true story happens to be that Corrina was a senion citizen.  Jessie did try to fix her up with dad, but of course, it never succeeded.  And she wrote it just that way, as it happened.  After she was done, however, and was reviewing it, she knew that she had written a fine after-school special, not a full feature movie.  This is one time I'm glad they changed the real life situations!This movie is seperated into two distinct halves; one where Molly doesn't talk, and the other half where she does.  The first half is very beautiful, artistic, and insightful; approaching masterpiece in my mind.  The second half is wonderful as well, but it just doesn't have the same magical, dreamy feel as the first.  The musical score fits the movie extraordinarily well.  Thomas Newman's hand in the composing is evident.  And the actors' characterizations are just as good as it gets.  Ray Liotta has always been one of my favorite current actors; it's a shame he's made some very bad career decisions.  I didn't know Whoopi Goldberg had it in her, but she's perfect in this movie.  The chemistry between Manny and Corrina is also an unexpected surprise.  Tina Majorino is wonderful as Molly in both halves (two rather different roles to play).  The supporting actors are at their best, not to mention Don Ameche, who has, I think, one word in the whole film.  But what a touching performance in this smaller role!So, now we know, somebody CAN make 'em like they used to!

The story involved a time warp back to the late 50s. Everybody smoked under any and all circumstances. The streets were crowded with late 50s and earlier cars. (Where does Hollywood get them all?) The prevailing racial attitudes of the 50s prevailed. Little bits of 50s and earlier music filled the airwaves and, yes, ""Corrina, Corrina"" was one of the songs.The story involved a family (Mother, Father, young girl). The mother died leaving the father (Ray Liotta) in need of a house keeper and caretaker of the little girl. In stepped Whoopi (Corrina)i. The story involved the gradual adjustment of this little group into a functioning household. It was funny in places. It was touching in places. It was a feel-good movie that came to a happy ending.

Daniel,"[8, 9]","This movie is beautiful from start to finish.Whoopi Goldberg is perfectly casted as Corrina, a black (well, duh) nanny who is employed by a white Jew (very well played by Ray Liotta), to take care of his daughter Molly (again excellently played by Tina Majorino).The plot. Manny Singer's (Ray) wife has just died leaving him and his 7 year old daughter (Tina) behind. Molly is a little lost after this and she doesn't speak a word to her father or anyone else. After employing a plethora of disastrous nannys Manny finally comes to Corrina, who is perfect. One problem: She's black, he's white, and this is 1959 segregated America.After a little while Molly begins to talk again and is generally uplifted by Corrina, who seems to have this miraculous way of bringing people back to their feet, including Manny. Corrina and Manny fall in love against all odds, and what you get is a beautiful interracial romance that at that time is classed as wrong, even abnormal. No one approves apart from Molly and her Grandfather (Don Ameche).One down side to this film, and I will add that it is the only down side, is the ending - you don't really know what happens. If I hadn't done a little research then I wouldn't have known that director Jessie Nelson had based this film on her true life story. She's black and her now husband of 40 odd years was white. This story is her story. They got married and lived happily ever after - but we have to guess. So the ending could have used a little bit more work. But that's it!! The movie is just wonderful.

Whoopi Goldberg plays a nanny who is hired by an Athiest (Ray Liotta) to look after his 7 year old girl, Molly. It takes some time getting used to Corrina and her religous beliefs (because she'd tell Molly that her mother, who had recently passed away, was in Heaven and the father told Corrina not to be telling Molly such things because he and his deceased wife were Athiest), but in the end, the father comes to accept Corrina's intentions and find what's best for his daughter. There are some heartbreaking moments in the film that will have tears running down your cheeks, but there are also moments where you'll be laughing your sorrow away. This movie is pretty much perfect. When Molly's mother died, she became miserable and wouldn't talk to anyone. She wouldn't say one word.

It has a good  combination of  all the things that make life  interesting. I loved all the characters in the movie. You can tell everyone wanted to make this  movie  as real and  enjoyable as possible. There are so many  scenes that  make this movie  a real treasure.Originally, my mom had rented it on VHS one day and we sat and watched it. We had to stop halfway through  becasue she had to  go to work but when she returned we finished it and  loved it!!!! Later on we got it again on DVD. I was  so overjoyed. Then she let someone  borow it and  we  never  saw it again.I was so upset. Fast forward a  couple  years later and find it on Amazon and buy a copy for her and myself. The acting is good and  there is a lot of fun to be had.One of my favorite scenes  is when  Molly has to spell out vaccum to her  dad after telling him that  she won the spelling bee. (This was hilarious and  Corrina's reaction is  really funny.)There is  also another  scene where  they are sitting down to dinner and Molly haphazardly  let's slip some  personal information about  Ms. Washington. Just to see Whoopi's eyes  during this  segment  is hilarious and so  realistic.

A terrific job directing, editing and all the nuances that pull together a fine production.",5,One of my all time Fav Sleeper flicks,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,549,"['keeper', 'collection', 'story', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'players', 'major', 'minor', 'do', 'super', 'job', 'acting', 'story', 'find', 'inspiring', 'heartwarming', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'striking', 'memorable', 'Character', 'walking', 'curtains', 'blowing', 'wind', 'open', 'window', 'black', 'white', 'projection', 'home', 'movie', 'little', 'girl', 'staring', 'sky', 'lying', 'next', 'mother', 'dress', 'hand', 'pocket', 'mother', 'dress', 'terrific', 'job', 'directing', 'editing', 'nuances', 'pull', 'together', 'fine', 'production']",Corrina Corrina VHS

Whoopi's appearance kicks it up a notch as she brings some spice into the lives of widowed Manny Singer and his daughter, Molly.I've watched this movie so many times, I've memorized dialogue and gestures. It's part of my own video library. Watching Corrina, Corrina always guarantees I'll be smiling and feeling lighthearted by the time the final credits roll. The music is superb (I bought the soundtrack) and always gets me singing and popping my fingers.Some of my favorite moments are when Whoopi steps off the bus and grinds out her cigarette with her pointy-toed shoe; the scene at the drive-in diner with Patrica Darbo (love her accent); the magic stoplights; Lois and &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;; the beautiful scene where Corrina and Molly are listening to &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; and Manny is looking out over the city; when Corrina and Percy stick their tongues out at each other; when Corrina dangles a chandelier piece from her ear and tells Molly &quot;No we can't; we simply can't&quot;; when Manny mistakenly calls Corrina Molly's mother; when Manny wins the Bromide account but Jenny spoils the moment; when Molly calls Corrina and the dog is between Corrina and Anthony; when Manny puts his arm around Corrina while Molly's flying the kite; when Manny and Corrina kiss while dancing; when Manny kisses Corrina outside her sister's house.Okay, so I liked ALL the moments! Anyway, one final tidbit. When TNN first showed the movie, they interviewed Jessie Nelson, the writer, director, and producer (I think). She said that the story was based on her life. Her widowed father hired a black housekeeper, and young Jessie wished they would get married and the housekeeper would be her new mom.I wish the romantic storyline had been more developed; but what little was there was done beautifully and tenderly by Liotta and Goldberg. I read somewhere that Whoopi really wanted to play the love interest for Liotta and advised Nelson not to hire a Halle Berry-type (read beautiful black woman). Her reason was because she wanted to show that someone as handsome as Liotta could really fall for a woman who society may not think of as externally beautiful but who is exceptionally beautiful on the inside.",5,All-time Favorite Feel-good Movie!,982886400,"02 23, 2001",2001,2366,"['little', 'gem', '1994', 'one', 'best', 'smile-inducing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'turn', 'ad', 'man', 'circa', '1950s', 'tender', 'Whoopi', 'appearance', 'kicks', 'up', 'notch', 'spice', 'lives', 'widowed', 'Manny', 'Singer', 'daughter', 'Molly.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'memorized', 'dialogue', 'gestures', 'part', 'own', 'video', 'library', 'Watching', 'Corrina', 'Corrina', 'always', ""'ll"", 'be', 'smiling', 'feeling', 'lighthearted', 'time', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'music', 'superb', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'always', 'singing', 'popping', 'fingers.Some', 'favorite', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Whoopi', 'bus', 'out', 'cigarette', 'pointy-toed', 'shoe', 'scene', 'drive-in', 'diner', 'Patrica', 'Darbo', 'love', 'accent', 'magic', 'stoplights', 'Lois', 'quot', 'Queen', 'Day', 'quot', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'where', 'Corrina', 'Molly', 'are', 'listening', 'quot', 'Somewhere', 'Rainbow', 'quot', 'Manny', 'looking', 'out', 'city', 'when', 'Corrina', 'Percy', 'stick', 'tongues', 'out', 'other', 'when', 'Corrina', 'chandelier', 'piece', 'ear', 'tells', 'Molly', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quot', 'when', 'Manny', 'mistakenly', 'Corrina', 'Molly', 'mother', 'when', 'Manny', 'Bromide', 'account', 'Jenny', 'moment', 'when', 'Molly', 'Corrina', 'dog', 'Corrina', 'Anthony', 'when', 'Manny', 'arm', 'Corrina', 'Molly', 'flying', 'kite', 'when', 'Manny', 'Corrina', 'kiss', 'dancing', 'when', 'Manny', 'Corrina', 'sister', 'house.Okay', 'liked', 'moments', 'Anyway', 'one', 'final', 'tidbit', 'When', 'TNN', 'first', 'showed', 'movie', 'interviewed', 'Jessie', 'Nelson', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'think', 'said', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'life', 'widowed', 'father', 'hired', 'black', 'housekeeper', 'young', 'Jessie', 'wished', 'would', 'get', 'married', 'housekeeper', 'would', 'be', 'new', 'mom.I', 'wish', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'developed', 'what', 'little', 'was', 'was', 'done', 'beautifully', 'tenderly', 'Liotta', 'Goldberg', 'read', 'somewhere', 'Whoopi', 'really', 'wanted', 'play', 'love', 'interest', 'Liotta', 'advised', 'Nelson', 'not', 'hire', 'Halle', 'Berry-type', 'read', 'beautiful', 'black', 'woman', 'reason', 'was', 'wanted', 'show', 'someone', 'as', 'handsome', 'Liotta', 'could', 'really', 'fall', 'woman', 'who', 'society', 'may', 'not', 'think', 'as', 'externally', 'beautiful', 'who', 'exceptionally', 'beautiful', 'inside']",Corrina Corrina VHS
