One story tells more of how Miroku got the wind tunnel and what effects will come when he loses control of it.  One story tells us about Sango's scar and how she got it from her younger brother.  Of course since this is but a small part of the series it will leave you with more questions than answers unless you are familiar with the story.",5,scars of batt;e,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,484,"['part', 'first', 'season', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'are', 'really', 'background', 'stories', 'secondary', 'characters', 'specifically', 'Miroku', 'Sango', 'One', 'story', 'more', 'how', 'Miroku', 'got', 'wind', 'tunnel', 'what', 'effects', 'will', 'come', 'when', 'control', 'One', 'story', 'Sango', 'scar', 'how', 'got', 'younger', 'brother', 'course', 'small', 'part', 'series', 'will', 'leave', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'are', 'familiar', 'story']",N/A
763504,A3B97VI1KMKRL2,B0000AINL0,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","On this disk set you get three great episodes each expanding and illustrating two of the newest characters in Inu Yasha's gang: Miroku and (my fav.) Sango.  The first episode is mostly about Miroku which explains a bit more about the history and dangers of his wind tunnel.  Miroku injures his right hand when he sucks in a giant demon and sets off to have it repaired without telling the rest of the gang.  Naturally Miroku finds himself in trouble and eventually must come to the decision of either letting his friends die or use his wind tunnel and save them but kill himself.The next two episodes are about Sango.  Sango reveals, to Kagome at least, how she got a horrible scar on her back from her little brother and the battel/trap that happened at Naraku's castle.  Ironically the next day the group comes across a village which has been slaughterd only to find, to Sango's suprise and dispair, that the killer was Kohaku, Sango's little brother who was brought back to life by a jewel shard and now being controlled by Naraku.  Naraku, staying true to form, sets up another one of his horrible traps and forces Kohaku to fight Sango who refuses to fight back and is horribly injured.  Angered by the chain of events, Kagome takes on Naraku in a suprising turn of events and nearly kills him--she is def. not a chick someone wants to anger...VERY bad idea.Well, that's a summary of the episodes for you and i have got to say that these three episodes are some of the greatest in the series.  Loyalty and friendship are both put to the test and as well as courage and peserverance.  The characters all find that they must stay strong and stick together if they ever wish to defeat Naraku and no one learns this lesson more than Sango.  If you like Inu Yasha then these are must have episodes for you.  Each are key in character development and the understanding of the plot.",5,More of the Inu Yasha We Love,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,1880,"['disk', 'set', 'get', 'three', 'great', 'episodes', 'expanding', 'illustrating', 'two', 'newest', 'characters', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'gang', 'Miroku', 'fav', 'Sango', 'first', 'episode', 'mostly', 'Miroku', 'bit', 'more', 'history', 'dangers', 'wind', 'tunnel', 'Miroku', 'right', 'hand', 'when', 'giant', 'demon', 'sets', 'off', 'have', 'repaired', 'telling', 'rest', 'gang', 'Naturally', 'Miroku', 'trouble', 'eventually', 'must', 'come', 'decision', 'letting', 'friends', 'die', 'use', 'wind', 'tunnel', 'save', 'kill', 'himself.The', 'next', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'Sango', 'Sango', 'reveals', 'Kagome', 'least', 'how', 'got', 'horrible', 'scar', 'back', 'little', 'brother', 'battel/trap', 'happened', 'Naraku', 'castle', 'Ironically', 'next', 'day', 'group', 'village', 'been', 'slaughterd', 'only', 'find', 'Sango', 'suprise', 'dispair', 'killer', 'was', 'Kohaku', 'Sango', 'little', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'jewel', 'shard', 'now', 'being', 'controlled', 'Naraku', 'Naraku', 'staying', 'true', 'form', 'up', 'one', 'horrible', 'traps', 'forces', 'Kohaku', 'fight', 'Sango', 'who', 'fight', 'back', 'horribly', 'injured', 'Angered', 'chain', 'events', 'Kagome', 'Naraku', 'suprising', 'turn', 'events', 'nearly', 'def', 'not', 'chick', 'someone', 'anger', 'VERY', 'bad', 'idea.Well', 'summary', 'episodes', 'i', 'have', 'got', 'say', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'greatest', 'series', 'Loyalty', 'friendship', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'as', 'well', 'courage', 'peserverance', 'characters', 'find', 'must', 'stay', 'strong', 'stick', 'together', 'ever', 'wish', 'defeat', 'Naraku', 'one', 'lesson', 'more', 'Sango', 'like', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'then', 'are', 'must', 'have', 'episodes', 'are', 'key', 'character', 'development', 'understanding', 'plot']",N/A

Each member of the Inu-Yasha Gang has his or her own struggle as they all come united against Naraku, the big bad bully. Sango seeks to save her dead brother, while Inu-Yasha and Kagome have to find balance in their relationship. What about Miroku, you ask? Well... I guess that his wind tunnel is currently his biggest concern now.  What's more, the whole gang faces another trap by Naraku. I'd say this is getting very good and very deep in an emotional way.

Now he needs help from Mushin, the man who looked after him after his father's death, to sew it up before it widens and shortens his lifespan.  Of course, this was all a trap by Naraku, who proceeds to have a demon take over Mushin's body, and then sends tons more demons out to finish our slightly-lecherous-and-sometimes-questionable-but-overall-good-guy monk.  Now, Inuyasha, Kagome, Sango, and Shippo need to save him before it's too late!  Some very good fight sequences, and even some nice humor, and we also get a bit more insight into not only Miroku, but also Inuyasha, who uses his Tetsusaiga blade at its full power for the first time ever in this episode.The next two episodes are the highlight for me, mainly since they focus on my favorite anime girl of all time, Sango!  Naraku, apparently deciding he hasn't screwed up poor Sango's life enough, revives her dead brother with a Shikon fragment, but brother Kohaku is now a zombie/mind-controlled/puppet/etc.  Naraku tells her that unless she steals Inuyasha's Tetsusaiga, he'll kill Kohaku again.  These two episodes see Sango's loyalty to her brother and her friends put to the test.  Naraku is so mean for continuing to torture her.  Some highlights include a humorous scene with Kagome in her own time, plus Inuyasha and Miroku getting beat up by the girls due to a misunderstanding.  Kagome also gets a brief time to shine near the end when she faces off with Naraku, in a really cool moment where we learn that it's not wise to tick her off.Overall, these episodes are some of my favorites, and are definitely worth checking out.  5/5",5,Miroku and Sango get some time in the limelight.,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,1702,"['Things', 'look', 'bad', 'Miroku', 'when', 'kazanna', 'tunnel', 'hand', 'cut', 'giant', 'mantis', 'Now', 'help', 'Mushin', 'man', 'who', 'looked', 'father', 'death', 'sew', 'up', 'lifespan', 'course', 'was', 'trap', 'Naraku', 'who', 'have', 'demon', 'take', 'Mushin', 'body', 'then', 'tons', 'more', 'demons', 'finish', 'slightly-lecherous-and-sometimes-questionable-but-overall-good-guy', 'monk', 'Now', 'Inuyasha', 'Kagome', 'Sango', 'Shippo', 'need', 'save', 'too', 'late', 'very', 'good', 'fight', 'sequences', 'even', 'nice', 'humor', 'also', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'insight', 'not', 'only', 'Miroku', 'also', 'Inuyasha', 'who', 'Tetsusaiga', 'blade', 'full', 'power', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'episode.The', 'next', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'highlight', 'mainly', 'focus', 'favorite', 'anime', 'girl', 'time', 'Sango', 'Naraku', 'apparently', 'deciding', ""n't"", 'screwed', 'up', 'poor', 'Sango', 'life', 'enough', 'dead', 'brother', 'Shikon', 'fragment', 'brother', 'Kohaku', 'now', 'zombie/mind-controlled/puppet/etc', 'Naraku', 'Inuyasha', 'Tetsusaiga', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'Kohaku', 'again', 'two', 'episodes', 'see', 'Sango', 'loyalty', 'brother', 'friends', 'put', 'test', 'Naraku', 'so', 'mean', 'continuing', 'torture', 'highlights', 'include', 'humorous', 'scene', 'Kagome', 'own', 'time', 'Inuyasha', 'Miroku', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'girls', 'due', 'misunderstanding', 'Kagome', 'also', 'brief', 'time', 'shine', 'end', 'when', 'Naraku', 'really', 'cool', 'moment', 'where', 'learn', 'not', 'wise', 'tick', 'off.Overall', 'episodes', 'are', 'favorites', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', '5/5']",N/A
763507,A3HBVVZCMJPPX4,B0000AINL0,Dr. Michael A. Rinella,"[1, 1]","All three of these episodes are great, it's a high point in the series (up to this time), particularly if you like episodes with plenty of action.  There's plenty of fighting with demons, including the Arch-Demon (he who caused all the trouble to begin with!) Naraku.  The showdown between Sango and Naraku in the final episode is a must-see.The first episode highlights that Miroku the monk is still unable to resist a pretty woman, but that he now has friends who will come to his aid.  The episode develops his character nicely, and is often very funny.  The second and third episodes highlight Sango, and see the return of her thought-to-be-dead little brother.  Turns out little brother has been brought back from the dead using a jewel shard (ok, it's magic) by Naraku and doesn't remember who he was.  Naraku is a master manipulator and liar and has Sango dancing to his tune, which infuriates her and leads to the big showdown.  She too learns that she has friends who will come to her aid.  The second episode has a bit of a moral lesson about landmines, though I suspect that is lost on most viewers.The extras are as usual fairly minimal.  The DVD box art is a departure but a rather embarassing one since they chose to put a naked Sango and Kagome on it just to show the ""scars of battle"" on Sango's back.
