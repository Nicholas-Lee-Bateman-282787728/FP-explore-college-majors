The overall rating of this show is 5/5, it's so well put together for a short anime series. You do however have to buy the 2 movies, The King of Eden and Lost Paradise to actually finish the plot though. But both movies in BluRay/Dvd combo are so reasonably priced, that in the near future I will be buying them as well.

Add in some conspiracy, some rivalry and a dash of style and it should have been a winner. It is interesting but I felt like the plot was rushed. At 11 episodes it seemed to me that they ran out of money to finish it properly and so skipped a couple of episodes so that they could reach the planned ending. So overall I liked its plot and style but would hesitate to recommend it wholeheartedly. I think there's a sequel and I'll probably watch that too. So give this a try but if you're expecting fast paced action then be advised that this isn't the series for you.",3,Flawed piece of modern anime,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,676,"['liked', 'premise', 'series', 'naked', 'guy', 'memory', 'up', 'DC', 'then', 'save', 'Japan', 'Add', 'conspiracy', 'rivalry', 'dash', 'style', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'winner', 'interesting', 'felt', 'plot', 'was', 'rushed', '11', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'ran', 'money', 'finish', 'properly', 'so', 'skipped', 'couple', 'episodes', 'could', 'reach', 'planned', 'ending', 'overall', 'liked', 'plot', 'style', 'would', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'wholeheartedly', 'think', 'sequel', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'too', 'So', 'give', 'try', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'then', 'be', 'advised', ""n't"", 'series']",Eden of the East: The Complete Series

What if you had a phone that could give you anything you wanted and make anything happen? How would you use it to change the world? What if you didn't have a choice? Change the world for the better or die trying.A girl is standing in front of The White House. A buck naked man with a handgun and a cellphone walks up to her and he has no idea why. He has amnesia and needs help. And soon finds that he's being hunted. But the cellphone he carries has the power to make anything he wants happen and has quite a bit of spending change on it to do it too. The catch is he has to change the world with that money. If he runs out it's his life. There are other players in this game, too. All with the the power and money of the phone but with much different views of how the world should be changed. If they succeed first then he dies. He doesn't want to include the girl in this mess but they can't seem to avoid each other. He makes her life more interesting.  She's his first and only memory. Together they sort out his puzzle of a past as he tries to make the world better. But was he always this charismatic and gentle man she knows? Was he dangerous before his amnesia?Eden of the East is nothing but brilliant plot and exciting adventure. You will watch it in it's entirety as fast as you can. It's that good. Just remember that there are two movies that finish the story, King of Eden and Paradise Lost. The story is incomplete without them. It's called an anime classic for a reason.

1361489,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B003SPDS8A,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 2]","If you enjoy cyber punk anime, then you deserve to treat yourself to this amazing masterpiece!  Produced by the same team and writer as Ghost in the Shell SAC, Eden of the East is a riveting story full of lies, deceit, love, hate, life, death, hope and pain.Just watching the opening scene I was immediately shocked (in a good way).  It opens with a young man holding a gun, standing naked outside the White House (and for squeamish folks, they tastefully white out his nether regions).  He has no memory and holds a phone that has access to a concierge and billions of yen.  Despite his care free attitude, he does have an interest in discovering more about his past and unraveling the mystery of 'the game'.The Japanese voice acting is perfect.  I mean PERFECT.  Not since Gundam Seed has there been such a perfectly matched ensemble of talented voice actors as this.  I didn't even flip over to the American voice dub to check it out (as there are only a couple of series that I think do justice with the voice overs).Though the first episode poses many questions and focuses on the chance encounter between the two protagonists; the series really gets going in the second episode.  By the sixth episode I guarantee a riveting experience.This series charges ahead at full speed, taking you along for an insane, mind bending ride without pausing for breath.  I planned on watching two episodes then turning in; I actually finished the entire series and stayed up half the night to finish it (it's not that long of a series)!  SO if you have an open mind and several hours to set aside, then dive right in.  I can't wait until I get my copy of the film sequel:Eden of the East: King of Eden (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)when it is released!Oh one other fun note: watching in the original Japanese I noticed that the American people are actually voiced by American actors (even for the Japanese version).  I truly found this to be a nice touch that adds to the authenticity of this series.  Bravo Studio Production IG! Keep 'em comin!",5,HOLY #&$%!!!!!!!!!!!

1361492,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B003SPDS8A,Coulter Rail,"[6, 6]","Don't get me wrong: Eden of the East is good anime. It's from the writer/director of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, so the storyline is intelligent and solid. The characters are charming and don't stink of clich&eacute; anime archetypes. The concept is interesting and I was driven to see the conclusion. So why couldn't this climb to four or five stars? Let's get to it:***PROS***ANIMATIONSmooth, no shortcuts or gimmicks. The backgrounds are a high point and stand out from standard anime. The battle animation and choreography look great, although battles are almost nonexistent.CHARACTERSThe main character is funny, confident, and completely at home in his confusion. His self-assurance gives the series a lighthearted attitude that helps to keep it entertaining but also causes a problem down the road, which I'll get to. There's a hacker called ""Panties"" who'll come into play in the second half, and he is fantastic. The rest of the players are mildly interesting and not annoying, which seems to be hard to achieve nowadays in anime.STORYIt's hard to touch on the story without throwing up *SPOILERS* because the whole point of the show is that the main character (Akira) has amnesia--and thus the audience should be amnesiacs, as well. We learn of this world as we go along. Akira wakes up naked outside the Capitol in Washington, DC. He has a gun, a cellphone, and no memory. The token female lead appears, and it's time to figure out what's going on. His cellphone has a ton of yen on it and an operator on call that can make pretty much anything happen. It's intriguing and enjoyable to unravel the facts of this unique world.***CONS***PACINGEden of the East suffers from some pacing issues that begin around episode five. The story slows to service a romance and some curious side characters, and the casual attitude that makes Akira so likable begins to erode the seriousness that the plot is trying to form. The lag isn't terrible, but I felt myself getting bored. Worry set in that this show was going to lose its narrative or that the creators didn't have a conclusion planned at all (which anime is famous for). This story DOES HAVE A CONCLUSION, but it drifts between epic and disappointing--an odd feeling. While I can say I liked the resolution, I also felt the show deserved more.MUSICThe soundtrack is light, funky, and has some jazzy vocals. This quirkiness works during cute moments or when Akira is being slick, but during the intense scenes the lightness of the music undermines the gravity of the content. The missile attack finale is ruled by this music, dampening a great scene and making the end of the show feel like every other episode: charming and mildly entertaining.Don't let my gripes dissuade you from watching this series; it's a good story and worth your time. I just expected more from the team behind this, because I knew they had the potential to create something fantastic. They created an interesting world and characters, and then moved them forward mildly. I will watch the movies and hope that they include the much-needed drama and intensity that the series is missing. Please enjoy, but don't expect action or anything more than what you start with. The story is interesting and well-conceived, but that is all.",3,"A Well-Conceived Story, Albeit Devoid of Action or Intensity",1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,3273,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Eden', 'East', 'good', 'anime', 'writer/director', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Stand', 'Alone', 'Complex', 'storyline', 'intelligent', 'solid', 'characters', 'are', 'charming', 'do', ""n't"", 'stink', 'clich', 'eacute', 'anime', 'archetypes', 'concept', 'interesting', 'was', 'driven', 'see', 'conclusion', 'So', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'climb', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'Let', 'get', 'shortcuts', 'gimmicks', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'high', 'point', 'stand', 'out', 'standard', 'anime', 'battle', 'animation', 'choreography', 'look', 'great', 'battles', 'are', 'almost', 'nonexistent.CHARACTERSThe', 'main', 'character', 'funny', 'confident', 'completely', 'home', 'confusion', 'self-assurance', 'series', 'lighthearted', 'attitude', 'keep', 'entertaining', 'also', 'problem', 'down', 'road', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hacker', 'called', 'Panties', 'who', ""'ll"", 'come', 'play', 'second', 'half', 'fantastic', 'rest', 'players', 'are', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'not', 'annoying', 'be', 'hard', 'achieve', 'nowadays', 'anime.STORYIt', 'hard', 'touch', 'story', 'throwing', 'up', '*SPOILERS*', 'whole', 'point', 'show', 'main', 'character', 'Akira', 'amnesia', 'thus', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'amnesiacs', 'well', 'learn', 'world', 'go', 'along', 'Akira', 'up', 'naked', 'Capitol', 'Washington', 'DC', 'gun', 'cellphone', 'memory', 'token', 'female', 'lead', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'cellphone', 'ton', 'yen', 'operator', 'call', 'can', 'make', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'happen', 'intriguing', 'enjoyable', 'unravel', 'facts', 'unique', 'world', '***CONS***PACINGEden', 'East', 'suffers', 'pacing', 'issues', 'begin', 'episode', 'five', 'story', 'service', 'romance', 'curious', 'side', 'characters', 'casual', 'attitude', 'Akira', 'so', 'likable', 'begins', 'erode', 'seriousness', 'plot', 'trying', 'form', 'lag', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'felt', 'getting', 'bored', 'Worry', 'set', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'lose', 'narrative', 'creators', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'conclusion', 'planned', 'anime', 'famous', 'story', 'DOES', 'HAVE', 'A', 'CONCLUSION', 'epic', 'disappointing', 'odd', 'feeling', 'can', 'say', 'liked', 'resolution', 'also', 'felt', 'show', 'deserved', 'more.MUSICThe', 'soundtrack', 'light', 'funky', 'jazzy', 'vocals', 'quirkiness', 'cute', 'moments', 'when', 'Akira', 'being', 'slick', 'intense', 'lightness', 'music', 'gravity', 'content', 'missile', 'attack', 'finale', 'ruled', 'music', 'dampening', 'great', 'scene', 'making', 'end', 'show', 'feel', 'other', 'episode', 'charming', 'mildly', 'entertaining.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'gripes', 'dissuade', 'watching', 'series', 'good', 'story', 'time', 'just', 'expected', 'more', 'team', 'knew', 'had', 'potential', 'create', 'something', 'fantastic', 'created', 'interesting', 'world', 'characters', 'then', 'moved', 'forward', 'mildly', 'will', 'watch', 'movies', 'hope', 'include', 'much-needed', 'drama', 'intensity', 'series', 'missing', 'Please', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'action', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'start', 'story', 'interesting', 'well-conceived']",Eden of the East: The Complete Series
1361493,AYRFLAT8VF732,B003SPDS8A,"DC_Fan_52 ""-Weasel!""","[3, 4]","No Spoilers.Ladies and gentlemen of the Amazon[.]com, I have committed a cardinal sin of TV/movie buying, I bought this blind. That mean I bought this series without knowing anything about it. I knew only about as much as the back of the box says. Something about naked in front of the white house with a gun. But, I was so anxious to get my very first anime on Blu-ray that I decided to buy into the hype and buy End of the East. Yes, I managed to see the hype without learning about the series at the same time.For starters, let be clear, Eden of the East is not an action heavy show. If you want action, you're barking up the wrong tree, its a mystery/political series, sorta.After viewing it once, I can say I'm left a little disappointed.On the positive side, Eden of the East has excellent animation, the hand drawn parts are appealing to the eye and there's some beautifully integrated CG elements. It's easy to tell this is from Production I.G., the animation company behind ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"" (A favorite of mine). Plus, the series has superb pacing, steadily we learn pieces of what Takizawa is involved with. It's also a series that you'll want to marathon, watch in 2-3 sittings. And the characters are likable.On the negative side, there's a few plot holes, dangling plot threads, and questions left unanswered. A few of these problems might be answered after repeated viewing (I have only watched it once, like I said), but they're definitely there. Plus, it seems you must have a knowledge about the problems facing Japan to appreciate the main plot: an aging population, shrinking job market, and rising unemployment, this gets talked about in the series.Eden of the East ends with a lot of stuff in the air, so that's the root of my disappointment. I immediately checked online, to see if they were planning a second series, but instead they're going to make three movies, all of which have been licensed by FUNimation. Speaking of FUNi, they turn out their usual standard of excellence. Yep, the days of bad dubs are essentially gone.So, I like it, but I'm disappointed that I have to wait for 3 movies to come out to get the complete story. You can think of it as a positive, it definitely left me wanting more. But, now I wish I knew more stuff going in. I paid $32 for this series, now I wish I'd paid $20-25.It also has a bunch of Japanese extras, which is rare since FUNimation doesn't usually get those. I haven't watched them, but they must be informative. I can't watch them because the subtitles look so tiny on my TV. Can I say something that has nothing to do with this show? I HATE Blu-ray menus/subtitles. They're impossible to read. They assume that you're watch on a +50"" HDTV, so they make tiny menus that look nice, but they're IMPOSSIBLE to read on a small screen. Whoever keeps Okaying the tiny blu-ray menus, I hope your eyes fall out.So, a solid 4-Stars, for excellent pacing and superb animation.

Amith (kndy),"[26, 27]","In April 2009, a few of Japan's popular talents in the anime and manga industry teamed up on a project known as ""Higashi no Eden"" (Eden of the East).Featuring anime production from Production I.G., ""Eden of the East"" would feature the work of series creator Kenji Kamiyama (creator of ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" and worked on ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"", ""Hakkenden"" and ""Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade""), manga artist/writer Chica Umino (""Honey and Clover""), art director Yusuke Takeda (""Mobile Suit Gundam Wing"", ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"", ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"") and legendary anime musician Kenji Kawai (""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Maison Ikkoku"", ""Patlabor"", ""Ranma 1/2', ""Vampire Princess Miyu"").The anime series debuted on Fuji TV in April 2009 and was followed by three films and now the complete series has been released on Blu-ray (and three films will follow) courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.VIDEO :""Eden of the East"" is just fantastic to look at.  Presented in 1080p, the artistic backgrounds are magnificent.  I don't think there was one re-used (aside from Takizawa's home) but there was always a new painted scene whenever a character was shown.  If there is one thing that I've noticed with recent Production I.G. anime TV series, despite it being a TV series, they still go out of there way to make the series look phenomenal.  Each painted scene looks fantastic, the character designs by Chica Umino come alive!The animation and overall colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and I saw no excessive haloing, edge enhancements and saw no artifacting.  This is one beautiful anime series and definitely one of the best, if not the best, looking anime series on Blu-ray thus far.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Eden of the East - The Complete Series"" is presented in English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The audio for this series is fantastic.  From the crowd ambience and just the sounds of leaves, police sirens, blasts, airplanes, computer keyboard clicking, you name it, the audio was well utilized through the surround channels.Dialogue and Kenji Kawai's impressive musical score is crisp and clear through the front and center channels.  Both Japanese and English vocal tracks were well-done!  Although not an all-out action-driven anime series, there is quite a bit of action throughout the eleven episodes and the lossless audio was very good!I have to admit that I was surprised to hear Oasis' ""Falling Down"" theme but I've noticed that the theme is only present in the first episode and fans have told me that it ran throughout the whole series.  I'm guessing the rights to license the song for Blu-ray and DVD release was expensive.  But at least the song is presented in the first episode.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Eden of the East - The Complete Series"" comes with the following special features:* Director Kamiyama & Original Character Designer Chica Umino Interview - (21:49) A wonderful interview on how the collaboration between Kenji Kamiyama (series creator/director) and ""Honey and Clover"" mangaka Chica Umino came about.  A very cool interview but as always, Umino-san continues to be a mystery as she uses her trademark bear (featured in her HandC manga to cover her face).* Kimura (Takizawa) and Hayami (Saki) Interview - (18:32) Interviews with voice actor Ryohei Kimura (voice of Takizawa) and Saori Hayami (voice of Saki).  The two talk about not knowing what kind of series they were doing a voices for but while recording, being impressed with what they saw and being happy to be part of the series.* Directors Kamiyama & Oshii Interview - (27:17) Director Kenji Kamiyama and Mamoru Oshii sit down to discuss the production of ""Eden of the East"".* Art Director Takeda Interview - (15:36) Art director Yusuke Takeda talks about working with Umino's characters and the things he discussed with director Kamiyama before taking on the series.  Also, showcasing the Bamboo studio as they worked on the backgrounds and Yusuke explains several scenes and what challenges he had and what he wanted to achieve.* Composer Kawai Interview - (10:41) Interview with Kenji Kawai who talks about the music of the series and what he has planned.  Also, showing us a few of the tracks he created at the studio.* TV Spot - (:32) The commercial for the Japanese Blu-ray and DVD release.* Promotion Video - (1:51) The Japanese promotional video for ""Eden of the East"".* Textless Closing Song -* Trailers - FUNimation Entertainment trailersJUDGMENT CALL:Production I.G. has delivered one of the finest anime television anime series to be released on Blu-ray in America.  With the release of ""Ghost Hound"" from Sentai Filmworks last month which I gave a highly favorable review for it, I thought the Production I.G. series was just phenomenal.  But here they are once again with another series and not only does it come with wonderful animation and many brilliantly painted backgrounds (which is rare to see on a anime TV series), the series creator manages to wrap the main storyline in 11 episodes.Most anime TV series tend to run 22-26 episodes and yet, Kenji Kamiyama and Production I.G. manage to do it with 11 episodes and what a wonderful series ""Eden of the East"" has turned out to be!The series has turn out to be one surprise after the other.  From hearing the Oasis theme song, to seeing a well-crafted anime series from director/writer/creator Kenji Kamiyama, seeing the character designs from Chika Umino (which I'm a big fan of the ""Honey and Clover"" manga series), hearing the awesome jazzy music from Kenji Kawai, to see the talented BAMBOO team behind the painted backgrounds of this series....everything about this series is magnificent.  Animation, background design, storyline, music...And then not only do you have a series which looks awesome on Blu-ray, the lossless audio is great and you get a good number of lengthy special features.  This has got to be my favorite anime series on Blu-ray for 2010, hands down!I can go on and on about why I love this series but I will just say that when it comes to anime TV series on Blu-ray, I don't expect much because these anime studios are handling other series at the same time and frankly, many are completed within hours of airing on Japanese television.  Anime TV series are usually not detailed like a film or OVA but somehow in 2010, Production I.G. have two anime series on Blu-ray in the U.S. that just breaks traditional convention of anime TV series and how they can look and literally raises the bar of animation and artistic backgrounds.  ""Ghost Hound"" was incredible and the Blu-ray for the series was awesome... but FUNimation Entertainment has done well by releasing this Blu-ray, to include several lengthy special features (and not just the standard opening and ending themes) and is now planning to release the three ""Eden of the East"" films on Blu-ray as well.And as far as raising the bar for how anime TV series should look, the fact that they got Chica Umino and Ryohei Kimura involved was awesome but just looking at the anime series, rarely do you see the backgrounds being used more than once.  It's like every scene features new animation and background art and there was special emphasis on lighting and once again, this is not the kind of detail you usually see in a anime TV series.  But Production I.G. must have high standards because so far, I've been impressed with their work and it just gets better and better.It may be a little early since the year is not over but in terms of anime releases on Blu-ray in America, ""Eden of the East - The Complete Series"" may be my pick for ""Anime Series on Blu-ray of the Year (2010)"".Highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray: Definitely the top contender of best anime series on Blu-ray of 2010!,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,7703,"['April', '2009', 'few', 'Japan', 'popular', 'talents', 'anime', 'manga', 'industry', 'teamed', 'up', 'project',

From the start I was hooked I watched it all over a week, but if I didn't have a life I would have watched it all within a day.  The reason I say almost perfect is I think they could have taken a few more episodes to flush out some story plot points.  Some charecters seem to be thrown in and not explained at all.  And the way they just threw in the Eden Of The East computer system was a bit strange.  But all in all if you get it going in thinking this isn't an action show you will love it.

1361497,AKH54WVWXATR4,B003SPDS8A,Jake Taylor,"[1, 1]","I decided to buy and look into this anime (and its two feature-length movie continuations) for two reasons: one, the animation looked gorgeous, and two, the plot sounded very intriguing and original. While I can say that it did fulfill both of those expectations, it didn't quite reach the heights it seemed like it could have.I won't spoil anything here and I won't bother giving a plot synopsis because you can read it on here already; what I will say is that the mysteries are all enticing at first, but like so many mysteries, the answers don't live up to the questions. After learning the truth behind the plot, I was excited for where the show could go with it, but it... didn't, really.The plot sort of fumbles along without really taking advantage of the tools it's set up, and in the end it leaves you feeling unsatisfied. The two sequel movies are absolutely necessary if you care at all about the story or closure, but even with them you'll probably feel disappointed. This is simply my opinion, however - you may find something here that I didn't.On the plus side, the characters are pretty great (except for the protagonist during ""King of Eden"", who is very lacking in personality for that movie only for reasons that will be clear if you watch it), and their interactions are very real. The mystery, while it lasts, is intriguing enough to keep you watching to learn more, even if you're ultimately unsatisfied with the denouement. The animation and artwork are beautiful and the music is good enough.Overall, I think that Eden of the East is worth a watch for those curious, but not worth a purchase unless you just really take to it. It's an entertaining enough ride, but at the end of the day it never reaches the heights or importance of ""Ghost in the Shell"" despite purporting to be similar, and so it's best enjoyed as one would enjoy something like the ""Bourne"" movies - an entertaining but ultimately shallow experience that's fun while it lasts, but leaves little impact.",3,Had Potential,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,1995,"['decided', 'buy', 'look', 'anime', 'two', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'continuations', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', 'animation', 'looked', 'gorgeous', 'two', 'plot', 'sounded', 'very', 'intriguing', 'original', 'can', 'say', 'did', 'fulfill', 'expectations', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'heights', 'seemed', 'could', 'have.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'giving', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'can', 'read', 'here', 'already', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'mysteries', 'are', 'enticing', 'first', 'so', 'many', 'mysteries', 'answers', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'questions', 'learning', 'truth', 'plot', 'was', 'excited', 'where', 'show', 'could', 'go', 'did', ""n't"", 'really.The', 'plot', 'sort', 'fumbles', 'really', 'taking', 'advantage', 'tools', 'set', 'up', 'end', 'feeling', 'unsatisfied', 'two', 'sequel', 'movies', 'are', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'care', 'story', 'closure', 'even', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', 'disappointed', 'simply', 'opinion', 'however', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'here', ""didn't.On"", 'plus', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'great', 'protagonist', 'King', 'Eden', 'who', 'very', 'lacking', 'personality', 'movie', 'only', 'reasons', 'will', 'be', 'clear', 'watch', 'interactions', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'mystery', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'learn', 'more', 'even', ""'re"", 'ultimately', 'unsatisfied', 'denouement', 'animation', 'artwork', 'are', 'beautiful', 'music', 'good', 'enough.Overall', 'think', 'Eden', 'East', 'watch', 'curious', 'not', 'purchase', 'just', 'really', 'take', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'ride', 'end', 'day', 'never', 'heights', 'importance', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'purporting', 'be', 'similar', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'would', 'enjoy', 'something', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'entertaining', 'ultimately', 'shallow', 'experience', 'fun', 'little', 'impact']",Eden of the East: The Complete Series

1361501,A3ODKKGVALLI2G,B003SPDS8A,Keris Nine,"[2, 2]","It takes a while, but when you get beneath the surface of what appears to be a typical anime/manga approaching-the-apocalypse situation, there are some interesting and more modern themes tackled in Eden of the East that have a rather more urgent contemporary feel than the usual preoccupation with post-war trauma and questions of national identity.What appears initially to be a post-apocalyptic event - the series set soon after Careless Monday, when an unexplained missile strike took out large sections of downtown Tokyo and targeted five other major cities - soon turns out to be only the tip of the iceberg. Finding himself naked in Washington DC, with his memory wiped, Akira Takizawa gradually discovers that he is part of some elaborate and dangerous game, one of twelve ordinary Japanese citizens selected by a mysterious organisation to be a Seleo, armed with a special phone and access to ten billion yen, charged with coming up with a solution to the crisis facing Japan, and given free-rein to interpret this aim and spend the money in whatever way they see fit.The subject of a selected group of powerful individuals who have the power to either save the world from a looming apocalypse or themselves bring it about is a fairly common anime subject, but Eden of the East is paced rather differently from such series and appears to have other aims than just the usual build-up to an epic grand-scale destruction of the planet. At the heart of the story is the fate of young disenfranchised Japanese people and their struggle against the conservative and traditional ruling establishment that hold them back from realising their true potential in a modern globalised world, represented here not only by Saki and her friends who are developing a revolutionary computer programme, but by the existence and the role of NEETs or Shut-ins, young men who have dropped out of conventional society in favour of a locked-room, computer-oriented existence.It's a little unsettling and confusing that Eden of the East doesn't follow the usual anime template however, and it isn't until quite late in the series that its purpose becomes clear. Each episode doesn't exactly leave you eager for what happens next and the tone is difficult to judge, with several bizarre episodes being based around a castrating 'johnny-hunter' set to an incongruous soundtrack of poppy Japanese music. It definitely gains momentum however, and it's a series that works best when considered as a whole rather than on individual episodes. Having said that, while technically the whole 11-part series is included here, the resolution is left to be completed by a couple of feature-length episodes. One hopes they will follow soon.",4,Interesting new spin on the Japanese anime apocalypse scenario,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,2709,"['while', 'when', 'get', 'surface', 'what', 'be', 'typical', 'anime/manga', 'approaching-the-apocalypse', 'situation', 'are', 'interesting', 'more', 'modern', 'themes', 'tackled', 'Eden', 'East', 'have', 'rather', 'more', 'urgent', 'contemporary', 'feel', 'usual', 'preoccupation', 'post-war', 'trauma', 'questions', 'national', 'identity.What', 'initially', 'be', 'post-apocalyptic', 'event', 'series', 'set', 'soon', 'Careless', 'Monday', 'when', 'unexplained', 'missile', 'strike', 'took', 'out', 'large', 'sections', 'downtown', 'Tokyo', 'targeted', 'five', 'other', 'major', 'cities', 'soon', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'Finding', 'naked', 'Washington', 'DC', 'memory', 'wiped', 'Akira', 'Takizawa', 'gradually', 'part', 'elaborate', 'dangerous', 'game', 'one', 'twelve', 'ordinary', 'Japanese', 'citizens', 'selected', 'mysterious', 'organisation', 'be', 'Seleo', 'armed', 'special', 'phone', 'access', 'ten', 'billion', 'yen', 'charged', 'coming', 'up', 'solution', 'crisis', 'facing', 'Japan', 'given', 'free-rein', 'interpret', 'aim', 'spend', 'money', 'way', 'see', 'fit.The', 'subject', 'selected', 'group', 'powerful', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'power', 'save', 'world', 'looming', 'apocalypse', 'bring', 'about', 'fairly', 'common', 'anime', 'subject', 'Eden', 'East', 'paced', 'rather', 'differently', 'such', 'series', 'have', 'other', 'aims', 'just', 'usual', 'build-up', 'epic', 'grand-scale', 'destruction', 'planet', 'heart', 'story', 'fate', 'young', 'disenfranchised', 'Japanese', 'people', 'struggle', 'conservative', 'traditional', 'ruling', 'establishment', 'hold', 'back', 'realising', 'true', 'potential', 'modern', 'globalised', 'world', 'represented', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'Saki', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'developing', 'revolutionary', 'computer', 'programme', 'existence', 'role', 'NEETs', 'Shut-ins', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'dropped', 'conventional', 'society', 'favour', 'locked-room', 'computer-oriented', 'existence.It', 'little', 'unsettling', 'confusing', 'Eden', 'East', ""n't"", 'follow', 'usual', 'anime', 'template', 'however', ""n't"", 'quite', 'late', 'series', 'purpose', 'becomes', 'clear', 'episode', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'leave', 'eager', 'what', 'next', 'tone', 'difficult', 'judge', 'several', 'bizarre', 'episodes', 'being', 'based', 'castrating', ""'johnny-hunter"", 'set', 'incongruous', 'soundtrack', 'poppy', 'Japanese', 'music', 'definitely', 'gains', 'momentum', 'however', 'series', 'best', 'when', 'considered', 'whole', 'rather', 'individual', 'episodes', 'Having', 'said', 'technically', 'whole', '11-part', 'series', 'included', 'here', 'resolution', 'left', 'be', 'completed', 'couple', 'feature-length', 'episodes', 'One', 'will', 'follow', 'soon']",Eden of the East: The Complete Series

There are also plenty of interesting characters. My complaint is that it leaves you hangin' big time.

They are caught up in a game. The person that changes the country for the best is the winner, and the losers all die. These people are called Selacao. The Selacao all have a phone that connects them to a system that can grant almost any request no matter how crazy or grandiose, however, a fee for each request is taken from the balance on their phone.This anime is very original and entertaining.

1361504,AIO0Y6M8CLEKF,B003SPDS8A,MarkoSion,"[2, 2]","I peeked through the styles of Kenji Kamiyama on some episodes of his work on GITS: Stand Alone Complex, and watched the production team create a web of cyber-punk diaries and plots, and though at times very convoluted, was a master work of alternate universes and an in-depth look at cyborgs and humanity.  I knew that coming into this series I was hesitant that this might be a repeat of the cycle, but I came away pleasantly surprised as Kamiyama weaves an excellent balance of a bizarre game, dark themes, humor, and a hard look at the current social situation that is in Japan.  In my opinion, what makes this an even more rich series is when someone watches it with knowing that Japan is going through a huge state of change and malaise, while the whole idea of someone coming out of the fray to fulfill their 'noblesse oblige as a savior' is a very thought-provoking theme.A mysterious man, Mr. Outside, gives several contestants dubbed ""selecao"" a phone in which they have 10 billion to do as they please.  The catch is that they must use these funds to fulfill their noblesse oblige, or their obligation in a high position to be generous, to change the whole of Japan.  Some squander it for selfish gain, some use it for for their own vision of Japan, and in the meanwhile in Episode I we run into our hero, Akira Takizawa.  He is standing in front of the White House, naked with this phone and gun in hand; his memories wiped clean.  He is dubbed Selecao No. 9.  He runs into a shocked Saki Morimi, a recent college graduate on a trip with her friends, whom they develop a quick friendship.  Together, and with other friends, pursue the game's meaning and see that this game has noble intentions but cruel endings: those who use up their funds are eliminated by ""the supporter.""The plot unfolds on many levels, but the creative energy behind this is that Akira, Saki and friends, as well as the other Selecao, mish and mash to reveal a wider examination of what Japan's state is like today:  a nation in flux where young people, expected to carry the flame forward, live in an era where jobs are not available or are expected to work for meager wages.  Akira comes to represent the NEETs (""Neither employed, educated, or training"") and fights for them, while some other contestants have more sinister notions of creating a Japan that starts from fresh, or some thinking that purging criminals will help heal the wounds.The series is unique that unlike GITS, it holds weight on both sides to have a dark, complex theme unfold while keeping it humorous and light.  One of dread as characters lash out to try to make their own noblesse oblige while not trying to get killed, one of love between Akira and Saki, who uncover his past and fall in love slowly, and a group of friends who stick with one another to solve the mystery of this game.  The soundtrack is a great foundation to express these themes, with its jazzy and cute overtones and haunting ambiances throughout key parts in the episodes.One of the most memorable series I have seen in a while, one with profound imagery, and one that will surprise you where it goes.  Don't expect characters to make big decision to change the world: Akira is a troubled soul but knows what he has to do to make Japan right.  Its not always in the evident changes, but always in the undertones.",5,Clever Yet Relevant,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,3346,"['peeked', 'styles', 'Kenji', 'Kamiyama', 'episodes', 'work', 'GITS', 'Stand', 'Alone', 'Complex', 'watched', 'production', 'team', 'create', 'web', 'cyber-punk', 'diaries', 'plots', 'though', 'times', 'very', 'convoluted', 'was', 'master', 'work', 'alternate', 'universes', 'in-depth', 'look', 'cyborgs', 'humanity', 'knew', 'coming', 'series', 'was', 'hesitant', 'might', 'be', 'repeat', 'cycle', 'came', 'away', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Kamiyama', 'excellent', 'balance', 'bizarre', 'game', 'dark', 'themes', 'humor', 'hard', 'look', 'current', 'social', 'situation', 'Japan', 'opinion', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'rich', 'series', 'when', 'someone', 'knowing', 'Japan', 'going', 'huge', 'state', 'change', 'malaise', 'whole', 'idea', 'someone', 'coming', 'fray', 'fulfill', ""'noblesse"", 'oblige', 'savior', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'theme.A', 'mysterious', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Outside', 'several', 'contestants', 'dubbed', 'selecao', 'phone', 'have', '10', 'billion', 'do', 'please', 'catch', 'must', 'use', 'funds', 'fulfill', 'noblesse', 'oblige', 'obligation', 'high', 'position', 'be', 'generous', 'change', 'whole', 'Japan', 'squander', 'selfish', 'gain', 'use', 'own', 'vision', 'Japan', 'meanwhile', 'Episode', 'run', 'hero', 'Akira', 'Takizawa', 'standing', 'front', 'White', 'House', 'naked', 'phone', 'gun', 'hand', 'memories', 'wiped', 'clean', 'dubbed', 'Selecao', 'No', '9', 'shocked', 'Saki', 'Morimi', 'recent', 'college', 'graduate', 'trip', 'friends', 'whom', 'develop', 'quick', 'friendship', 'Together', 'other', 'friends', 'pursue', 'game', 'meaning', 'see', 'game', 'noble', 'intentions', 'cruel', 'endings', 'who', 'use', 'up', 'funds', 'are', 'eliminated', 'supporter', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'many', 'levels', 'creative', 'energy', 'Akira', 'Saki', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'Selecao', 'mish', 'mash', 'reveal', 'wider', 'examination', 'what', 'Japan', 'state', 'today', 'nation', 'flux', 'where', 'young', 'people', 'expected', 'carry', 'flame', 'forward', 'live', 'era', 'where', 'jobs', 'are', 'not', 'available', 'are', 'expected', 'work', 'meager', 'wages', 'Akira', 'represent', 'NEETs', 'Neither', 'employed', 'educated', 'training', 'fights', 'other', 'contestants', 'have', 'more', 'sinister', 'notions', 'creating', 'Japan', 'fresh', 'thinking', 'purging', 'criminals', 'will', 'help', 'heal', 'wounds.The', 'series', 'unique', 'GITS', 'weight', 'sides', 'have', 'dark', 'complex', 'theme', 'unfold', 'keeping', 'humorous', 'light', 'One', 'dread', 'characters', 'lash', 'try', 'make', 'own', 'noblesse', 'oblige', 'not', 'trying', 'get', 'killed', 'one', 'love', 'Akira', 'Saki', 'who', 'past', 'fall', 'love', 'slowly', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'stick', 'one', 'solve', 'mystery', 'game', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'foundation', 'express', 'themes', 'jazzy', 'cute', 'overtones', 'haunting', 'ambiances', 'key', 'parts', 'episodes.One', 'most', 'memorable', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'one', 'profound', 'imagery', 'one', 'will', 'surprise', 'where', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'characters', 'make', 'big', 'decision', 'change', 'world', 'Akira', 'troubled', 'soul', 'what', 'do', 'make', 'Japan', 'right', 'not', 'always', 'evident', 'changes', 'always', 'undertones']",Eden of the East: The Complete Series

1361513,AV1WAYOHXD1MA,B003SPDS8A,"The Pes ""Deerhoads""","[113, 122]","Takizawa Akira, early 20s, stands in front of the White House, gun in hand, stark naked and a mysterious phone with the word Selecao imprinted on it.  Memory gone, Akira regains his consciousness after, seemingly, erasing his own memories just a few seconds back.  Why is he there?  What reason would he have to brandish a gun in front of such a place?  Why's his memory gone?What's happening?With all these important questions that should take precedent over anything else, his strange predicament takes a bow so that he can rescue a girl in front of him with a predicament of her own.  That girl, Saki Morimi, for entirely different reasons, stands in front of the White House and creates a situation, drawing the attention of the police.And with a simple step forward Akira goes to aid Saki, and a special relationship develops that gives meaning to this whole series.  This bond between them is what drives us, the viewer, to keep watching amidst all the mystery that revolves Akira's past, and his connection to the Selecao, the ""selector.""But, what's happening?As it turns out, Akira has been chosen as part of a group of people selected to ""save"" the country of Japan.  What he needs to save them from is not clear, but at his disposal is a mysterious phone and a bank account worth 10 billion Yen.  He can do anything necessary by calling Juiz, the operator, who can accomplish any request he desires.  And by anything, they mean anything.  Want to clear a path through traffic?  Done.  Want to have the Prime Minister of Japan say ""uncle"" on national TV? Done.  Want to murder someone?...yes, even that.  No problem.  But, there's a catch.  Each request is a transaction that dwindles the 10 billion yen down to zero.  Once that zero is reached a special Selecao, the Supporter, comes knocking at your door to snuff you out.  And it's game over, lights out--adios.You lose.The grand picture is revealed little by little, and in the end, it's a good story to follow.  I won't divulge more of my opinion on the ending, but just know it's worth it.  What really keeps you there is how the relationship between Akira and Saki develops.  Akira has a charm, an easy spirit that isn't suited for the task given to him by the Selecao.  Yet, in the state that he's in, he charges forward, uncovering the threads tangled within his past.  Saki, also is in a tiffy of her own as she feels lost in the world, trying to find a place where she can start her life.  With Akira beside her, and his problems, she becomes a sort of caretaker to him, something that she feels good about and finds meaning in.  Slowly but surely, both become each other's confidant, in a situation where things aren't clear and danger lurks in every corner, they can only trust themselves.Intriguing stuff, eh?Away from the story, everything else is good.  The show is a thing of beauty.  The art style is top notch, with clean lines, bright colors and fluid animation.  The soundtrack stands out and really fits the mood of the show, and the voice acting is great (I saw this with the Japanese voice track, so I can't comment on the quality of the English track).  And with a serious undertone as this, the show does deliver moments of levity and comic relief which never feel out of place.  It's a good mix of drama and comedy, which if it didn't exist, the show would be too overbearing--kudos to the writers for that blend.So is this a show for you?  I think everyone has a space for this type of anime, and truth be told, we need this kind of anime to do well.  Shows like Monster, Moribito, Fighting Spirit, Rainbow and Eden of the East are rare gems that you need to uncover amongst all the teen angst that populate most of anime shelves these days.  Anyone with a nose for mystery and suspense would do themselves a favor by picking this one up.Must buy.Just as an update, there are three other works out there past this DVD release.  One is a movie that compiles the series into a two hour film, compressing what occurs during the series.  The other two are feature length films that continue where the series left off.",5,Juiz says that this is worth your time,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,4100,"['Takizawa', 'Akira', 'early', '20s', 'stands', 'front', 'White', 'House', 'gun', 'hand', 'stark', 'naked', 'mysterious', 'phone', 'word', 'Selecao', 'imprinted', 'Memory', 'gone', 'Akira', 'consciousness', 'seemingly', 'erasing', 'own', 'memories', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'back', 'Why', 'there', 'What', 'reason', 'would', 'have', 'brandish', 'gun', 'front', 'such', 'place', 'Why', 'memory', 'gone', 'What', 'happening', 'important', 'questions', 'should', 'take', 'precedent', 'anything', 'else', 'strange', 'predicament', 'bow', 'so', 'can', 'rescue', 'girl', 'front', 'predicament', 'own', 'girl', 'Saki', 'Morimi', 'entirely', 'different', 'reasons', 'stands', 'front', 'White', 'House', 'situation', 'drawing', 'attention', 'police.And', 'simple', 'step', 'forward', 'Akira', 'aid', 'Saki', 'special', 'relationship', 'meaning', 'whole', 'series', 'bond', 'what', 'viewer', 'keep', 'watching', 'mystery', 'Akira', 'past', 'connection', 'Selecao', 'selector', 'what', 'happening', 'out', 'Akira', 'been', 'chosen', 'part', 'group', 'people', 'selected', 'save', 'country', 'Japan', 'What', 'save', 'not', 'clear', 'disposal', 'mysterious', 'phone', 'bank', 'account', 'worth', '10', 'billion', 'Yen', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'necessary', 'calling', 'Juiz', 'operator', 'who', 'can', 'accomplish', 'request', 'anything', 'mean', 'anything', 'Want', 'clear', 'path', 'traffic', 'Done', 'Want', 'have', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Japan', 'say', 'uncle', 'national', 'TV', 'Done', 'Want', 'murder', 'someone', 'yes', 'even', 'problem', 'catch', 'request', 'transaction', '10', 'billion', 'yen', 'down', 'zero', 'Once', 'zero', 'reached', 'special', 'Selecao', 'Supporter', 'knocking', 'door', 'snuff', 'out', 'game', 'lights', 'out', 'lose.The', 'grand', 'picture', 'revealed', 'little', 'little', 'end', 'good', 'story', 'follow', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'more', 'opinion', 'ending', 'just', 'know', 'What', 'really', 'how', 'relationship', 'Akira', 'Saki', 'Akira', 'charm', 'easy', 'spirit', ""n't"", 'suited', 'task', 'given', 'Selecao', 'state', 'forward', 'uncovering', 'threads', 'tangled', 'past', 'Saki', 'also', 'tiffy', 'own', 'lost', 'world', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'start', 'life', 'Akira', 'problems', 'sort', 'caretaker', 'something', 'good', 'finds', 'meaning', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'become', 'other', 'confidant', 'situation', 'where', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'clear', 'danger', 'lurks', 'corner', 'can', 'only', 'trust', 'themselves.Intriguing', 'stuff', 'eh', 'Away', 'story', 'everything', 'else', 'good', 'show', 'thing', 'beauty', 'art', 'style', 'top', 'notch', 'clean', 'lines', 'bright', 'colors', 'fluid', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'out', 'really', 'mood', 'show', 'voice', 'acting', 'great', 'saw', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'track', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'quality', 'English', 'track', 'serious', 'undertone', 'show', 'deliver', 'moments', 'levity', 'comic', 'relief', 'never', 'feel', 'place', 'good', 'mix', 'drama', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'overbearing', 'kudos', 'writers', 'blend.So', 'show', 'think', 'everyone', 'space', 'type', 'anime', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'need', 'kind', 'anime', 'do', 'well', 'Shows', 'Monster', 'Moribito', 'Fighting', 'Spirit', 'Rainbow', 'Eden', 'East', 'are', 'rare', 'gems', 'need', 'uncover', 'amongst', 'teen', 'angst', 'populate', 'most', 'anime', 'shelves', 'days', 'Anyone', 'nose', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'would', 'do', 'favor', 'picking', 'one', 'up.Must', 'buy.Just', 'update', 'are', 'three', 'other', 'there', 'DVD', 'release', 'One', 'movie', 'series', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'compressing', 'what', 'series', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'feature', 'length', 'films', 'continue', 'where', 'series', 'left', 'off']",Eden of the East: The Complete Series

1361520,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B003SPDS8A,Zack Davisson,"[1, 1]","""Eden of the East"" (a direct translation of Japanese title ""Higashi no Eden"") starts firing mysteries at you from the first frame, and never really stops even after the final episode ends.  I watched this series with my wife in one bold throw:  all eleven episodes back-to-back, and when we finished we both looked at each other and asked ""So what just happened?""Part spy-thriller, part-social commentary, part-surrealist love story, ""East of Eden"" is not an anime for those who like their story neat and clean.  The animation is flawless, as is the talent involved: writer and director Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell SAC), character designs by Chika Umino (Honey and Clover) and animation by Production I.G (Kill Bill - Volume One).Plot-wise, there is a lot packed into those eleven episodes.  21-year old Morimi Saki stands in front of the White House in Washington D.C. and throws something on the lawn. Takizawa Akira, completely naked and memory-less (alaThe Bourne Identity), appears holding a gun and a cell phone.  Japan suffered a missile attack that left huge wholes in the country but magically managed not to kill anyone, now know as Careless Monday.  Twelve operatives, called selecaos, are involved in a game to save the world. Each is given ten billion yen (roughly 100 million dollars) and access to a ""concierge"" who keeps track of their purchases and can deliver any service required from cleaning up dead bodies to making the Primer Minster say ""Uncle"" on live TV.  A group of college kids,  part of the NEET generation (In Japan NEET are a slacker sub-class. The word stands for No Employment, Education or Training), have developed an application called ""Eden"" which is a visual search engine that does a search via cellphone on anything it sees through the camera.  The smartest guy in the world is a shut-in nicknamed ""Underpants.""  A sexy female serial killer called the ""Johnny Chopper"" uses a killing method I will leave up to your imagination.Like I said, a lot packed in.""East of Eden"" was a great show, although I didn't love it as much as some people did.  Definitely not on the same level as Monster. It was disjointed, and a lot of questions that get posed are just never answered.  What did Morimi Saki throw onto the front lawn of the White House?  Who is the mysterious Supporter?  Did that girl really just grow wings and fly away?  Who are the little white monkey people?  Many of these questions are answered in the two theatrical movies that followed the series, but here they are just questions.There is one gapping plot hole.  In light of films like The Social Network, it is hard to imagine that these kids would invent something as amazing as the Eden software and not become instantly rich.  They said they couldn't figure out how to sell it, which I find hard to believe.  They would be millionaires.""East of Eden"" was interesting to me because I recently watched another Japanese film, ""Kaiji the Ultimate Gambler,"" that also offers a bizarre answer to the topical social question in Japan.  What do we do with all of these NEETs?  It is a big issue, and when I lived in Japan you could hardly turn on the TV without hearing something about it.  A whole generation of young adults who just don't want to work, study, or do anything.  A sort of country-wide malaise affecting people of a certain age.  Obviously it is time for the entertainment industry to offer their response.The DVD for ""Eden of the East"" has some extras, although not as many as theBlu-rayrelease.  There is an interview with the director and the two main voice actors.  There has been some complaints that the Oasis song that was used for the opening credits in Japan only appears on the first episode due to rights issues, but I honestly didn't even notice.  I tend to skip the opening and closing theme songs anyways, so it didn't affect my viewing experience at all.The subtitle track was fine.  Nothing really stood out and it did a good job.  One noticeable difference between the subtitle and the dub is the nickname of the computer genius who is called ""underpants"" in the subtitle and ""panties"" in the dub.  Technically, ""underpants"" is the correct Japanese equivalent, as ""panties"" implies women's underwear which is not at all the case in the Japanese language track.  But some one obviously thought it was funnier.",4,Just another Careless Monday,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,4346,"['Eden', 'East', 'direct', 'translation', 'Japanese', 'title', 'Higashi', 'Eden', 'firing', 'mysteries', 'first', 'frame', 'never', 'really', 'stops', 'even', 'final', 'episode', 'watched', 'series', 'wife', 'one', 'bold', 'throw', 'eleven', 'back-to-back', 'when', 'finished', 'looked', 'other', 'asked', 'So', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'Part', 'spy-thriller', 'part-social', 'commentary', 'part-surrealist', 'love', 'story', 'East', 'Eden', 'not', 'anime', 'who', 'like', 'story', 'neat', 'clean', 'animation', 'flawless', 'talent', 'involved', 'writer', 'director', 'Kenji', 'Kamiyama', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'SAC', 'character', 'designs', 'Chika', 'Umino', 'Honey', 'Clover', 'animation', 'Production', 'I.G', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Volume', 'One', '.Plot-wise', 'lot', 'packed', 'eleven', 'episodes', '21-year', 'old', 'Morimi', 'Saki', 'front', 'White', 'House', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'something', 'lawn', 'Takizawa', 'Akira', 'completely', 'naked', 'memory-less', 'alaThe', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'holding', 'gun', 'cell', 'phone', 'Japan', 'suffered', 'missile', 'attack', 'left', 'huge', 'wholes', 'country', 'magically', 'managed', 'not', 'kill', 'anyone', 'now', 'know', 'Careless', 'Monday', 'Twelve', 'called', 'selecaos', 'are', 'involved', 'game', 'save', 'world', 'given', 'ten', 'billion', 'yen', 'roughly', '100', 'million', 'dollars', 'access', 'concierge', 'who', 'keeps', 'track', 'purchases', 'can', 'deliver', 'service', 'required', 'cleaning', 'up', 'dead', 'bodies', 'making', 'Primer', 'Minster', 'say', 'Uncle', 'live', 'TV', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'part', 'NEET', 'generation', 'Japan', 'NEET', 'are', 'slacker', 'sub-class', 'word', 'Employment', 'Education', 'Training', 'have', 'developed', 'application', 'called', 'Eden', 'visual', 'search', 'engine', 'search', 'cellphone', 'anything', 'camera', 'smartest', 'guy', 'world', 'shut-in', 'nicknamed', 'Underpants', 'sexy', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'called', 'Johnny', 'Chopper', 'killing', 'method', 'will', 'leave', 'up', 'imagination.Like', 'said', 'lot', 'packed', 'East', 'Eden', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'as', 'much', 'people', 'did', 'Definitely', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'Monster', 'was', 'disjointed', 'lot', 'questions', 'get', 'posed', 'are', 'just', 'never', 'answered', 'What', 'did', 'Morimi', 'Saki', 'throw', 'front', 'lawn', 'White', 'House', 'Who', 'mysterious', 'Supporter', 'Did', 'girl', 'really', 'just', 'grow', 'wings', 'fly', 'away', 'Who', 'are', 'little', 'white', 'monkey', 'people', 'Many', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'two', 'theatrical', 'movies', 'followed', 'series', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'questions.There', 'one', 'gapping', 'plot', 'hole', 'light', 'films', 'Social', 'Network', 'hard', 'imagine', 'kids', 'would', 'invent', 'something', 'as', 'amazing', 'Eden', 'software', 'not', 'become', 'instantly', 'rich', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'sell', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'millionaires', 'East', 'Eden', 'was', 'interesting', 'recently', 'watched', 'Japanese', 'film', 'Kaiji', 'Ultimate', 'Gambler', 'also', 'bizarre', 'answer', 'topical', 'social', 'question', 'Japan', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'NEETs', 'big', 'issue', 'when', 'lived', 'Japan', 'could', 'hardly', 'turn', 'TV', 'hearing', 'something', 'whole', 'generation', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'work', 'study', 'do', 'anything', 'sort', 'country-wide', 'malaise', 'affecting', 'people', 'certain', 'age', 'time', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'offer', 'response.The', 'DVD', 'Eden', 'East', 'extras', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'theBlu-rayrelease', 'interview', 'director', 'two', 'main', 'voice', 'actors', 'been', 'complaints', 'Oasis', 'song', 'was', 'used', 'opening', 'credits', 'Japan', 'only', 'first', 'episode', 'due', 'rights', 'issues', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'tend', 'skip', 'opening', 'closing', 'theme', 'songs', 'anyways', 'did', ""n't"", 'affect', 'viewing', 'experience', 'all.The', 'subtitle', 'track', 'was', 'fine', 'Nothing', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'One', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'subtitle', 'dub', 'nickname', 'computer', 'genius', 'who', 'called', 'underpants', 'subtitle', 'panties', 'dub', 'Technically', 'underpants', 'correct', 'Japanese', 'equivalent', 'panties', 'implies', 'women', 'underwear', 'not', 'case', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', 'one', 'obviously', 'thought', 'was', 'funnier']",Eden of the East: The Complete Series
