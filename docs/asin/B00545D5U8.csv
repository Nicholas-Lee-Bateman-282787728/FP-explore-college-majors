The German language is not the problem, the casting is.  I don't know what could have possessed anyone to cast this series with this actor in the lead.

I happen to be a big Brunetti fan; I think if you like Brunetti, you'll love this, but I'm pretty sure these programs would also work if you're not familiar with Brunetti.  The acting, direction and screenplay are extremely good.  It's pretty much faithful to the plot, though not slavishly so.  The exterior shots of Venice are gorgeous, and I'm always happy to see that, but the interior shots are breathtaking.  I've seen most of the exterior scenes in person; never had a chance to see interiors of palazzi like this.So, I mean it's Brunetti, it's beautiful, bellisimo, it's extremely well done, it's Venice.  What else could you ask for?Also, like I said, I do love the Brunetti stories very much, but there's not much humor in them, or it doesn't come through for me, and at least some of the characters-- I'm thinking especially of Vianello-- don't come through for me either.  It adds a lot to see those characters brought to life, I didn't realize Brunetti and Vianello were so full of humor and good will.  They're not telling jokes or anything, they just exude these qualities.  I'll read them differently next time.  And Elettra-- porco santa!  And Paola is so gorgeous.The casting is really outstanding.A couple of people complained that the subtitles were too quick; I don't see that, wouldn't have had that thought if someone else hadn't mentioned it.  Not a problem.  Some people, maybe the same people, are bothered by the fact that it's in German, with English subtitles.  Again, I didn't find that to be a problem at all.  It was strange for about 5 seconds.  If it does bother you, I'd suggest just accepting it, and you'll probably get used to it in a few minutes.  Or you could just turn the sound down; you're reading subtitles anyway.  In fact, you can turn the sound down to a point where you can hardly even tell what language it is, but you still have the music and the voices.If you like Brunetti, or if it sounds interesting, give it a shot.

These videos might well be an example of that. I value positiveness enormously and greatly prefer it to ""trashing."" But in reviews I value most of all a fair, balanced description.  I am a fan of Donna Leon's mysteries. To me these television versions get it half right at best. The beauty of Venice is there, and it is a real pleasure.  Brunetti himself is pretty good. He is kind and committed.  His generally happy home life also comes through well and that too is a pleasure and in contrast with so much else on film. But there is a great deal that makes the books so good that does not come through. Complexity is lacking, including Brunetti's. And the pervasive corruption that haunts Brunetti is not quite tangible enough. It is not as powerful a limiting force - limiting what is possible for Brunetti to accomplish as well as his enjoyment of Venice and the beautiful world he inhabits due to ample money and happy marriage. The plots themselves seem so much thinner as well. So, overall, for a Brunetti fan these are pleasurable but also lacking.

I got used to ignoring the language, appreciated the voices and tones (some of which may have been dubbed), and read the translations.This is an excellent series. The only questionable note was the secretary, which interesting, unique character was miscast and misinterpreted, I thought. She behaves seductively toward Brunetti as they gaze too long, inexplicably, into each other's eyes. Otherwise, the characters matched the books just fine. There are two Brunettis actors and two of his wives, switching soon after the first one or two series. All are fine.

1441713,A35VI0H5AFHOJ5,B00545D5U8,Sharon Isch,"[17, 17]","What an odd mix of impressions fans of Donna Leon's Commissario Brunetti books are likely to find themselves having with the onscreen version:  Gorgeous cinematography of glorious Venice, where the actors playing Italians all speak their lines in German while we American viewers read English subtitles.  (Another reviewer here mentioned that this all becomes less jarring if you cut the volume way down.  Wish I'd thought of that.)The first double feature in this series tells tales from two of Leon's early Brunetti books, published in 1994-95. ""The Anonymous Venetian"" gets its title from the British version of Brunetti Book #3, known in the U. S. as ""Dressed for Death.""  It tells of a prominent Venetian banker who is found dead in drag queen makeup, with shaved legs and wearing red high heels.  ""Vendetta,""  based on book #4,  known as ""Death and Judgment"" in the U.S. and ""A Venetian Reckoning"" in Britain, is the story of a prostitution ring run by influential Venetians who import young girls from Eastern Europe by the truckload. (This info doesn't come with the discs. I was able to figure it out because I still have the books.)So how well will the Germans' takes on Brunetti et al measure up to the Leon characters we readers have been carrying around in our heads? Hard to tell, as the opinions on that in these reviews seem to vary all over the place. Here's my take, for what it's worth (probably not much.): The Brunetti in my head isn't short, balding and twinkly-eyed, but the actor playing him here is and he's very very good in the role.  The Vianello of my imagination doesn't tower over his boss and weigh maybe twice as much, as this one does, but he's not the doofus I thought him to be early on and the more I saw of him, the more I came to like and respect him.  While both Paola and Signorina Elettra are beauties, I think their roles lack the distinctive character, intellect and singular pizzazz of their print counterparts.  Neither of the Brunetti kids bears even the tiniest resemblance to a parent.  The big disappointment for me was Patta.  As with  Paola and Elettra, I fault the writing more than the acting.  This Patta doesn't come across anywhere near as incompetent,  pompous and in the pocket of the powerful  as his print version does.  Maybe these key roles will develop and distinguish themselves  more as the series continues.Sidenote:  At a bookstore appearance here in Washington in 2009,  Donna Leon told us that she was then in talks with a prominent British TV producer who wanted to do a Brunetti series for the BBC.  She said that, like her deal with the Germans, she'd leave them alone to recreate her stories as they liked and the only thing she'd requested (though not demanded) of the Brits is that the music be Baroque. (Guess she didn't like that German score.) As for the Germans, she didn't like it that,  as the series went on,  they were apparently turning Brunetti's mother,  who is a very minor character in the books, into a major character in the TV version,  probably because  a very popular German actress had been cast in that role.  Ms. Leon solved that  annoyance by killing the old girl off in her next book. Two years later, in the spring of '11 at another bookstore gig, there was no mention at all of that projected BBC series, so I guess it must not have worked out. (Note: Not having yet seen the rest of the series, I don't know where Brunetti's mom appears; she's not in either of these first two in the series.)3.5 stars",4,"On watching German actors playing Italians, but speaking in German, while we read English subtitles",1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,3503,"['What', 'odd', 'mix', 'impressions', 'fans', 'Donna', 'Leon', 'Commissario', 'Brunetti', 'books', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'having', 'onscreen', 'version', 'Gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'glorious', 'Venice', 'where', 'actors', 'playing', 'Italians', 'speak', 'lines', 'German', 'American', 'viewers', 'read', 'English', 'subtitles', 'reviewer', 'here', 'mentioned', 'less', 'jarring', 'cut', 'volume', 'way', 'down', 'Wish', ""'d"", 'thought', 'first', 'double', 'feature', 'series', 'tales', 'two', 'Leon', 'early', 'Brunetti', 'books', 'published', '1994-95', 'Anonymous', 'Venetian', 'title', 'British', 'version', 'Brunetti', 'Book', '3', 'known', 'U.', 'S.', 'Dressed', 'Death', 'prominent', 'Venetian', 'banker', 'who', 'found', 'dead', 'drag', 'queen', 'makeup', 'shaved', 'legs', 'wearing', 'red', 'high', 'heels', 'Vendetta', 'based', 'book', '4', 'known', 'Death', 'Judgment', 'U.S.', 'A', 'Venetian', 'Reckoning', 'Britain', 'story', 'prostitution', 'ring', 'run', 'influential', 'Venetians', 'who', 'import', 'young', 'girls', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'truckload', 'info', ""n't"", 'come', 'discs', 'was', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'still', 'have', 'books', 'how', 'well', 'will', 'Germans', 'Brunetti', 'al', 'measure', 'Leon', 'characters', 'readers', 'have', 'been', 'carrying', 'around', 'heads', 'Hard', 'tell', 'opinions', 'reviews', 'seem', 'vary', 'place', 'Here', 'take', 'what', 'worth', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'Brunetti', 'head', ""n't"", 'short', 'balding', 'twinkly-eyed', 'actor', 'playing', 'here', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'Vianello', 'imagination', ""n't"", 'tower', 'boss', 'weigh', 'maybe', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'not', 'doofus', 'thought', 'be', 'early', 'more', 'saw', 'more', 'came', 'like', 'respect', 'Paola', 'Signorina', 'Elettra', 'are', 'beauties', 'think', 'roles', 'lack', 'distinctive', 'character', 'intellect', 'singular', 'pizzazz', 'print', 'counterparts', 'Brunetti', 'kids', 'bears', 'even', 'tiniest', 'resemblance', 'parent', 'big', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Patta', 'Paola', 'Elettra', 'fault', 'writing', 'more', 'acting', 'Patta', ""n't"", 'come', 'anywhere', 'incompetent', 'pompous', 'pocket', 'powerful', 'print', 'version', 'Maybe', 'key', 'roles', 'will', 'develop', 'distinguish', 'more', 'series', 'continues.Sidenote', 'bookstore', 'appearance', 'here', 'Washington', '2009', 'Donna', 'Leon', 'told', 'was', 'then', 'talks', 'prominent', 'British', 'TV', 'producer', 'who', 'wanted', 'do', 'Brunetti', 'series', 'BBC', 'said', 'deal', 'Germans', ""'d"", 'leave', 'alone', 'recreate', 'stories', 'liked', 'only', 'thing', ""'d"", 'requested', 'not', 'demanded', 'Brits', 'music', 'be', 'Baroque', 'Guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'German', 'score', 'Germans', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'that', 'series', 'went', 'were', 'apparently', 'turning', 'Brunetti', 'mother', 'who', 'very', 'minor', 'character', 'books', 'major', 'character', 'TV', 'version', 'probably', 'very', 'popular', 'German', 'actress', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'role', 'Ms.', 'Leon', 'solved', 'annoyance', 'killing', 'old', 'girl', 'next', 'book', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'spring', ""'11"", 'bookstore', 'gig', 'was', 'mention', 'projected', 'BBC', 'series', 'guess', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'Note', 'Not', 'having', 'yet', 'seen', 'rest', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'Brunetti', 'mom', 'not', 'first', 'two', 'series', '3.5', 'stars']","Donna Leon's Commissario Brunetti Mysteries, Episodes 1 & 2"
