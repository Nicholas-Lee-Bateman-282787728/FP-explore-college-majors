However, not knowing much about James Joyce, I was confused at what all the hub-bub was.To me this was a story of a very troubled couple.  The man James Joyce a soon to be famous writer in his earlier years, horribly insecure.  The woman Nora Barnacle, a willful sexually risky young woman of her time, with a troubled past.  They meet on the street and not being of the same ""class"" initially the relationship is very uneven.  Soon however, they run off to Italy to escape not only both their pasts, but the puritanical restricts of Irish society of the day.As their relationship is fierce, so is its ups and downs.  They have children and James Joyce being a struggling writer takes much of his failures to heart and drowns them in the bottle.  Needless to say this does not improve things. They are often forced to rely on family for support.A bigger twist is placed in the relationship when James is forced to go back to Dublin for financial reasons to support the family. The already insecure man, is rattled by his friends attempt to meddle with his relationship with the former maid, now the mother of his two children.  Once they make up they find a peculiar way of mitigating their distance, by writing torrid letters to one another.  These letters apparently now part of James Joyce's writing.Soon however, when James returns to Italy, he riles things up locally and Nora leaves him to return to Ireland.The story continues.I found this hard to understand at times, you never really have a clue who James Joyce is from the movie.  I guess it is assumed you know.  I don't.  What triggers the initial attraction is also unexplained.  Also surprising is the forwardness of Nora, so early in a budding relationship.  Much is left very open.  You don't see why Nora puts up with James, he is very cold to her and often very obnoxious.  It seems more a sexual obsession for both.  Needless to say, both come across as very self-centered and immature throughout the whole of the movie.I gave it 3 stars because I felt things were not tied up well. The acting was well done, but the screenplay was lacking.",3,Not interesting on its own,1039910400,"12 15, 2002",2002,2133,"['story', 'intriqued', 'However', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'James', 'Joyce', 'was', 'confused', 'what', 'hub-bub', 'was.To', 'was', 'story', 'very', 'troubled', 'couple', 'man', 'James', 'Joyce', 'soon', 'be', 'famous', 'writer', 'earlier', 'years', 'horribly', 'insecure', 'woman', 'Nora', 'Barnacle', 'willful', 'sexually', 'risky', 'young', 'woman', 'time', 'troubled', 'past', 'meet', 'street', 'not', 'being', 'same', 'class', 'initially', 'relationship', 'very', 'uneven', 'Soon', 'however', 'run', 'off', 'Italy', 'escape', 'not', 'only', 'pasts', 'puritanical', 'restricts', 'Irish', 'society', 'day.As', 'relationship', 'fierce', 'so', 'ups', 'downs', 'have', 'children', 'James', 'Joyce', 'being', 'struggling', 'writer', 'much', 'failures', 'heart', 'drowns', 'bottle', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'improve', 'things', 'are', 'often', 'forced', 'rely', 'family', 'support.A', 'bigger', 'twist', 'placed', 'relationship', 'when', 'James', 'forced', 'go', 'back', 'Dublin', 'financial', 'reasons', 'support', 'family', 'already', 'insecure', 'man', 'rattled', 'friends', 'attempt', 'meddle', 'relationship', 'former', 'maid', 'now', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'make', 'up', 'find', 'peculiar', 'way', 'mitigating', 'distance', 'writing', 'torrid', 'letters', 'one', 'letters', 'apparently', 'now', 'part', 'James', 'Joyce', 'writing.Soon', 'however', 'when', 'James', 'Italy', 'things', 'up', 'locally', 'Nora', 'return', 'Ireland.The', 'story', 'continues.I', 'found', 'hard', 'understand', 'times', 'never', 'really', 'have', 'clue', 'who', 'James', 'Joyce', 'movie', 'guess', 'assumed', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'What', 'initial', 'attraction', 'also', 'unexplained', 'Also', 'surprising', 'forwardness', 'Nora', 'so', 'early', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Much', 'left', 'very', 'open', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'Nora', 'up', 'James', 'very', 'cold', 'often', 'very', 'obnoxious', 'more', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'Needless', 'say', 'come', 'very', 'self-centered', 'immature', 'whole', 'movie.I', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'felt', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'tied', 'up', 'well', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'screenplay', 'was', 'lacking']",Nora

Although he is a university student and she a maid at the local hotel, the two become lovers against the advise of Joyce's friends who lust after Nora themselves.  Joyce convinces Nora to join him in Italy where he has a teaching position.  The two begin their lives together living beyond their means, dressing fashionably, and fighting while raising children.  Nora is anything but a quiet professor's wife, she is the life force that motivates him.  Joyce, one of the major literary geniuses of the 20th century is revealed through the film that explores the volatile relationship between the couple.  Susan Lynch won the Best Actress award at the Dublin Film Festival for her performance as the earthy muse whose presence was as much a torture to Joyce as inspiration.  Ewan McGregor, in his first adult leading man role, proves he has matured as an actor of solid talent and sensitivity in his role as the jealous, insecure, yet brilliant writer.  Shot on location in Ireland and Italy, Nora is a small independent film produced by McGregor's company, Natural Nylon, and likely to be overlooked by most audiences.  However, if solid acting, adult story lines. and turn-of-the-century costume biopics are your cup of tea, this video is worth the price of purchase.",4,Nora and Joyce:  A Literary Genius and his Muse,991612800,"06 4, 2001",2001,1413,"['James', 'Joyce', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'spiritual', 'sexual', 'equal', 'partner', 'life', 'Nora', 'Barnacle', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'Dublin', 'university', 'student', 'maid', 'local', 'hotel', 'two', 'become', 'lovers', 'advise', 'Joyce', 'friends', 'who', 'lust', 'Nora', 'Joyce', 'Nora', 'join', 'Italy', 'where', 'teaching', 'position', 'two', 'begin', 'lives', 'together', 'living', 'means', 'dressing', 'fashionably', 'fighting', 'raising', 'children', 'Nora', 'anything', 'quiet', 'professor', 'wife', 'life', 'force', 'Joyce', 'one', 'major', 'literary', 'geniuses', '20th', 'century', 'revealed', 'film', 'volatile', 'relationship', 'couple', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'award', 'Dublin', 'Film', 'Festival', 'performance', 'earthy', 'muse', 'presence', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'torture', 'Joyce', 'inspiration', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'first', 'adult', 'leading', 'man', 'role', 'matured', 'actor', 'solid', 'talent', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'jealous', 'insecure', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'Shot', 'location', 'Ireland', 'Italy', 'Nora', 'small', 'independent', 'film', 'produced', 'McGregor', 'company', 'Natural', 'Nylon', 'likely', 'be', 'overlooked', 'most', 'audiences', 'However', 'solid', 'acting', 'adult', 'story', 'lines', 'turn-of-the-century', 'costume', 'biopics', 'are', 'cup', 'tea', 'video', 'price', 'purchase']",Nora

When he writes ""The Dead"" I'd hoped to hear the glorious final paragraph about flakes falling into the mutinous Shannon. And so on. But this was a filming of Brenda Maddox's book, not a gathering of Joyce writings. The point of ""The Dead"" in the film is to light up Joyce's compulsive jealousy of ""Gabriel"", Nora's first lover, not show how that lover later splintered into Blazes Boylan. The Joyce here begins as the callow Stephen Dedalus figure, then matures into a much weightier character with a genius for honesty who must never avoid the worst in human nature and, indeed, must hold it dear as a source of inspiration--even if he finds it in his wife. Dublin has bleached him white and he must write the gray prose of ""Dubliners"" to match his feelings, and then the photographically gray prose of ""Ulysses"". Earlier films had already dramatized Joyce's prose, Joseph Strick's ""Ulysses"" and John Huston's ""The Dead""--so why repeat what had already been done? Furthermore, when Joyce complains that Nora never reads his stories, she cries back, Why should I when I see how you twist my life in them? So Joyce's prose is not part of Nora's mind, not even the lovely end of ""The Dead""--so it would be out of place in Nora's universe in this film, as would her reactions to any sublime prose moment. We don't want to see Nora saying what a wonderful writer Jimmy is--although in later life she did enjoy the world's opinion of her husband. I found Ewan McGregor fighting against body type in trying to capture the slender figure of Joyce but that at times he did catch the Joyce silhouette balanced on his cane. McGregor's lighting was splendid, with artful shadows at times molding Joyce's features and even reaching into his head to see Joyce's cold gray torment. Since the film ends before ""Dubliners"" is even published--or rather with the type being smashed by the printers--there can be no reason for working some of Joyce's later writing or glories into the the script. The focus is on Nora, and Susan Lynch, also working against body type in trying to figure forth a robust Nora, does wonderfully. She may never again have as great a role to play. The film successfully plays Nora's burly richness of feeling against Joyce's complexity and writerly distraction snd I for one loved it. Let me add that as I watched it, alas on tape, I kept thinking ""Here is a film that will never earn back its costs--except emotionally for what Stendahl calls 'the happy few.'"" As movies go, this is a treasure and I plan to see it again on DVD. Rosettes to Ewan McGregor, who produced as well as starred, and to Susan Lynch for her unwavering flow of feeling that lapped at my heart like a cow's tongue.",5,THE BARNACULAR JOYCE,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,2818,"['too', 'first', 'wished', 'hear', 'more', 'Joyce', 'famous', 'comments', 'phrases', 'Ireland', 'old', 'sow', 'farrow', 'When', 'Dead', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'hear', 'glorious', 'final', 'paragraph', 'flakes', 'falling', 'mutinous', 'Shannon', 'so', 'was', 'filming', 'Brenda', 'Maddox', 'book', 'not', 'gathering', 'Joyce', 'writings', 'point', 'Dead', 'film', 'light', 'up', 'Joyce', 'compulsive', 'jealousy', 'Gabriel', 'Nora', 'first', 'lover', 'not', 'show', 'how', 'lover', 'later', 'splintered', 'Blazes', 'Boylan', 'Joyce', 'here', 'callow', 'Stephen', 'Dedalus', 'figure', 'then', 'much', 'weightier', 'character', 'genius', 'honesty', 'who', 'must', 'never', 'avoid', 'worst', 'human', 'nature', 'indeed', 'must', 'hold', 'dear', 'source', 'inspiration', 'even', 'wife', 'Dublin', 'bleached', 'white', 'must', 'write', 'gray', 'prose', 'Dubliners', 'match', 'feelings', 'then', 'photographically', 'gray', 'prose', 'Ulysses', 'Earlier', 'films', 'had', 'already', 'dramatized', 'Joyce', 'prose', 'Joseph', 'Strick', 'Ulysses', 'John', 'Huston', 'Dead', 'so', 'why', 'repeat', 'what', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'Furthermore', 'when', 'Joyce', 'Nora', 'never', 'stories', 'back', 'Why', 'should', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'twist', 'life', 'So', 'Joyce', 'prose', 'not', 'part', 'Nora', 'mind', 'not', 'even', 'lovely', 'end', 'Dead', 'would', 'be', 'place', 'Nora', 'universe', 'film', 'would', 'reactions', 'sublime', 'prose', 'moment', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Nora', 'saying', 'what', 'wonderful', 'writer', 'Jimmy', 'later', 'life', 'did', 'enjoy', 'world', 'opinion', 'husband', 'found', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'fighting', 'body', 'type', 'trying', 'capture', 'slender', 'figure', 'Joyce', 'times', 'did', 'catch', 'Joyce', 'silhouette', 'balanced', 'cane', 'McGregor', 'lighting', 'was', 'splendid', 'artful', 'shadows', 'times', 'molding', 'Joyce', 'features', 'even', 'reaching', 'head', 'see', 'Joyce', 'cold', 'gray', 'torment', 'film', 'Dubliners', 'even', 'published', 'rather', 'type', 'being', 'smashed', 'printers', 'can', 'be', 'reason', 'working', 'Joyce', 'later', 'writing', 'glories', 'script', 'focus', 'Nora', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'also', 'working', 'body', 'type', 'trying', 'figure', 'forth', 'robust', 'Nora', 'wonderfully', 'may', 'never', 'again', 'have', 'as', 'great', 'role', 'play', 'film', 'successfully', 'Nora', 'burly', 'richness', 'feeling', 'Joyce', 'complexity', 'writerly', 'distraction', 'snd', 'one', 'loved', 'Let', 'add', 'watched', 'tape', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Here', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'earn', 'back', 'costs', 'emotionally', 'what', 'Stendahl', 'happy', 'few', 'movies', 'go', 'treasure', 'plan', 'see', 'again', 'DVD', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'who', 'produced', 'as', 'well', 'starred', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'unwavering', 'flow', 'feeling', 'lapped', 'heart', 'cow', 'tongue']",Nora
695377,A3H1FLT1JO5ZM3,B000063K0C,"Em ""ebhappyfeet""","[5, 5]","I agree that one's appreciation of this film does depend on what is known of James Joyce's life and literary accomplishments. But providing that foundation was never the intent of the filmmakers to begin with.  The film assumes one has a familiarity with James Joyce's work. To someone just  watching it b/c of a teenage-type idol worship of Ewan McGregor, it would be like watching 'Shakespeare in Love' without having heard of 'Romeo and Juliet.But even without a background knowledge of Joyce's work, there are several facets of the film which undeniably stand on their own.Firstly, the sexual chemistry between the two main characters is undeniable. I found Susan Lynch's performance as Nora to be a bit `stand-offish and unapproachable' at times, which may leave the viewer wondering what attracted Jim to her in the first place. McGregor, however, very successfully portrays Joyce's intense love, lust, fear, and jealousy, (which almost had me sympathizing with his sense of betrayal when he needlessly suspected his wife to be unfaithful) and still convey total devotion, inspiration, and submission. (This makes me almost wonder if  McGregor's `sex-symbol' status is leading him to even make choices of superficial fluff like `The Island'.)And while women will (and do) inevitably find themselves attracted to the actor, I cannot deny that it is partly because he just puts it all out there and plays well-written roles like this so well. One cannot deny the beauty of this performance.Secondly, the film itself is very simply yet beautifully shot from the dark streets of Dublin, to the bright and beautiful Italian villas, the simplicity of the breathtaking landscapes and their reflection of the characters' moods and dispositions, tells its own story.And I do admit that one's appreciation is tempered by lack of background knowledge of Joyce and his work. ' So I do encourage viewers to read up on James Joyce and maybe, God forbid, pick up `Ulysses' or a collection of his poetry.  While one can appreciate the acting, writing, and cinematography, of the film independent of any background knowledge, a true understanding of James Joyce and the pedestal upon which he has places his `awe-inspiring' Nora can only truly be realized if one has a foundation to start from.",4,Strong Characters; Well-Portrayed; Facsinating Tale,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,2283,"['agree', 'one', 'appreciation', 'film', 'depend', 'what', 'known', 'James', 'Joyce', 'life', 'literary', 'accomplishments', 'providing', 'foundation', 'was', 'never', 'intent', 'filmmakers', 'begin', 'film', 'one', 'familiarity', 'James', 'Joyce', 'work', 'someone', 'just', 'watching', 'b/c', 'teenage-type', 'idol', 'worship', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'would', 'be', 'watching', ""'Shakespeare"", 'Love', 'having', 'heard', ""'Romeo"", 'Juliet.But', 'even', 'background', 'knowledge', 'Joyce', 'work', 'are', 'several', 'facets', 'film', 'undeniably', 'stand', 'own.Firstly', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'undeniable', 'found', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'performance', 'Nora', 'be', 'bit', 'stand-offish', 'unapproachable', 'times', 'may', 'leave', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'what', 'attracted', 'Jim', 'first', 'place', 'McGregor', 'however', 'very', 'successfully', 'Joyce', 'intense', 'love', 'lust', 'fear', 'jealousy', 'almost', 'had', 'sympathizing', 'sense', 'betrayal', 'when', 'needlessly', 'suspected', 'wife', 'be', 'unfaithful', 'still', 'convey', 'total', 'devotion', 'inspiration', 'submission', 'almost', 'wonder', 'McGregor', 'sex-symbol', 'status', 'leading', 'even', 'make', 'choices', 'superficial', 'fluff', 'Island', 'women', 'will', 'do', 'inevitably', 'find', 'attracted', 'actor', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'partly', 'just', 'there', 'well-written', 'roles', 'so', 'well', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'beauty', 'performance.Secondly', 'film', 'very', 'simply', 'yet', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'dark', 'streets', 'Dublin', 'bright', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'villas', 'simplicity', 'breathtaking', 'landscapes', 'reflection', 'characters', 'moods', 'dispositions', 'own', 'story.And', 'do', 'admit', 'one', 'appreciation', 'tempered', 'lack', 'background', 'knowledge', 'Joyce', 'work', 'do', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'read', 'up', 'James', 'Joyce', 'maybe', 'God', 'forbid', 'pick', 'up', 'Ulysses', 'collection', 'poetry', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'acting', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'film', 'independent', 'background', 'knowledge', 'true', 'understanding', 'James', 'Joyce', 'pedestal', 'upon', 'places', 'awe-inspiring', 'Nora', 'can', 'only', 'truly', 'be', 'realized', 'one', 'foundation', 'start']",Nora
695378,A1AUKTFT1P3P4Q,B000063K0C,farnorthgirl,"[0, 0]","Late one night I discovered the film, and thought,&#34; James Joyce, a love affair, Italy, Ewan McGregor, give it a try!&#34; This film is an example of being terrible despite the best intentions. Beautifully costumed with excellent period piece scenery, the film is curiously shallow. As scene after scene progressed with the same boring fumbling love-making between the stars, I still tried to hold on. How anyone could make James Joyce, a love affair and Italy boring, the film makers did. Too much time spend on adolescent making out, Ewan McGregor is not suited to the role of James Joyce, and the direction was horrific. Bland. No variety in angled shots, just an occasional mid-range shot, and almost always just head on portrait like, short range shots. I can not say for the script, I did not read it, however I am guessing the direction and production is what turned this into a flop. Despite all the challenges of a relationship across class lines in the day, travel, and sundry other elements this is solidly one of the most boring films I have ever seen. Surprising, as I find Ewan McGregor to be a superb actor with great character roles and choosing his films. The whole idea sounds promising even now, and I can understand why he undertook it. One more thing--this is also one instance where Ewan McGregor's outstanding looks and handesomeness just do not suit him for the role, a glamorization the film makes of reality. James Joyce one of the very great modern writers, was no doubt fascinating, however he was homely,  dark and brooding, at the very best plain, and looked nothing like Ewan McGregor. I suppose a film with a homely if not plain, actor probably would not sell.But even with his sunshine kissed looks, Ewan was not able to somehow channel the intensity and artistry of Joyce, and appears to kind of take a passive role in riding out this film, no matter what the highs and lows, he shows a type of passivity.",2,Catastrophically Bad,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,1942,"['Late', 'one', 'night', 'discovered', 'film', 'thought', '34', 'James', 'Joyce', 'love', 'affair', 'Italy', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'give', 'try', '34', 'film', 'example', 'being', 'terrible', 'best', 'intentions', 'Beautifully', 'costumed', 'excellent', 'period', 'piece', 'scenery', 'film', 'curiously', 'shallow', 'scene', 'scene', 'progressed', 'same', 'boring', 'fumbling', 'love-making', 'stars', 'still', 'tried', 'hold', 'How', 'anyone', 'could', 'make', 'James', 'Joyce', 'love', 'affair', 'Italy', 'boring', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'spend', 'adolescent', 'making', 'out', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'not', 'suited', 'role', 'James', 'Joyce', 'direction', 'was', 'horrific', 'Bland', 'variety', 'angled', 'shots', 'just', 'occasional', 'mid-range', 'shot', 'almost', 'always', 'just', 'head', 'portrait', 'short', 'range', 'shots', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'script', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'however', 'am', 'guessing', 'direction', 'production', 'what', 'turned', 'flop', 'challenges', 'relationship', 'class', 'lines', 'day', 'travel', 'sundry', 'other', 'elements', 'solidly', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Surprising', 'find', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'be', 'superb', 'actor', 'great', 'character', 'roles', 'choosing', 'films', 'whole', 'idea', 'promising', 'even', 'now', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'undertook', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'also', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'outstanding', 'looks', 'handesomeness', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'suit', 'role', 'glamorization', 'film', 'reality', 'James', 'Joyce', 'one', 'very', 'great', 'modern', 'writers', 'was', 'doubt', 'fascinating', 'however', 'was', 'homely', 'dark', 'brooding', 'very', 'best', 'plain', 'looked', 'nothing', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'suppose', 'film', 'homely', 'not', 'plain', 'actor', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'sell.But', 'even', 'sunshine', 'kissed', 'looks', 'Ewan', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'somehow', 'channel', 'intensity', 'artistry', 'Joyce', 'kind', 'take', 'passive', 'role', 'riding', 'out', 'film', 'matter', 'what', 'highs', 'lows', 'type', 'passivity']",Nora
695379,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000063K0C,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 5]","How one views this film will depend in part on how much of a Joyce devotee the viewer is.  As is the case with any film based on the life of a larger-than-life figure, the film will be largely viewed by those who have an avid interest in James Joyce.  These viewers will judge the film with a much more discerning eye.  The fact that Joyce's work does not have mass appeal and is devoured by a small but fervent group of literary intellectuals makes the scrutiny that much more intense.  For this audience, the film will have numerous unbearable flaws and inaccuracies.However, for the audience of non aficionados, this film has a great deal to recommend itself, providing that the viewer loves good drama and has the patience to endure its methodical pacing.  The story is a powerful love story with shearing forces that bring emotional torrent to the relationship.  In it we find the high minded writer, James Joyce, obsessed with Nora, the coarse and illiterate chamber maid whose practical wisdom and unfettered sexuality provide the ideal compliment and the perfect wedge.  These two are helpless moths being consumed by a bonfire of ardor built on differences that are as irreconcilable as they are essential to each of their souls.  Given this premise, we have the underpinnings of great theater.Despite the disappointment of many Joyce fans regarding this treatment, the film is really not about James Joyce, it is about the relationship.  Thankfully, director Pat Murphy didn't lose sight of that fact and succumb to the temptation to mollify Joyce fans by making this a Joyce-centric film.  Murphy patiently peels away the layers of each character and casts each revelation on the relationship like kerosene on a house fire.  The deeper we get into the characters, the more complex and hopeless the relationship becomes, and paradoxically, the more inextricably entwined its participants.Murphy's direction is excellent on all fronts.  The cinematography is incredible with awe inspiring locations and a wonderfully rich sepia quality that enhances the period renderings.  The look and feel the period is well done.  The early 20th century costumes, furniture, sets and props are precise and breathe life and realism into each scene.The acting is superb.  Ewan McGregor practically rips himself to shreds playing the mercurial Joyce, jovial and charming one minute, paranoid, brooding and insanely jealous the next.  However, poor Ewan once again has a terrific performance upstaged by his co-star Susan Lynch (See Nicole Kidman and &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;).Despite lacking the classic features of a leading lady, Lynch's physiognomy is a perfect match for the earthy Nora.

His tantrums against Nora came as a surprise to me, rather than seeing a build in jealousy, McGregor just kind of lets Joyce explode and retract.  Susan Lynch's performance is stellar, a tour de force.  The earthy half-smile of satisfaction is so intriguing as she paws and scratches her way to romance.  Nora comes alive in this portrayal as well-matched for the moody explosive Joyce.  If the film were better known, we'd be comparing theirs to the Burton-Taylor screen spats of George and Martha.

She is not so much beauty but just this real creative seductiveness that comes across in her personality. The way she speaks her mind and feels her emotions. The movie focuses more on Nora and James rather than on James works. There are some readings but the tumultous ups and downs of James and his jealousies and imaginings having to do with Nora is mainly the body of this work. The singing done by the two actors is just wonderful! I am going to see if I can find the soundtrack for the film and purchase it.

Ewan McGregor plays James Joyce and Susan Lynch plays Nora Barnacle. While the movie is titled after her it basically begins and ends with Joyce after a brief reflection of her being beaten by her Uncle and sent off to a nunnery after sneaking out with a local boy in Galway. The real story begins in 1904 when she moves away to work at a hotel as a servant. Here she meets Joyce who is instantly taken with her. On their first outing she introduces him to the intricacies of her hand which instantly links him to her forever but constantly brings around bouts of jealous and doubt from Joyce. Their relationship is frowned upon by everyone because she is poor and he is rich and they aren't married. The turmoil of their relationship is entwined with the turmoil of his attempts to write (and get published) the collection of short stories, Dubliners; specifically the Dead which he draws from Nora's past experience.

The stellar performance given by Susan Lynch, the quiet power of Ewan McGregor, the strength of the script, as well as the maturity this movie as a whole showed. I noticed that there was virtually no lead-in to the relationship between Nora and James Joyce, a total of 3 minutes to introduce Nora, and perhaps 20 seconds to introduce Mr. Joyce. At first, I was slightly put off at this, feeling as though I had been cheated out of a good, 15 minutes...but as the story progressed, I realized that a longer introduction would have been meaningless, and in the end, a waste of the moviegoers time. The great thing about this movie, is that it is about the relationship between James and Nora, not about their families, not about their jobs, not about their children (although all of these things play an important role within their lives, therefore impact how they act towards one another), but solely about *them*.Ewan McGregor is shocking in his portrayl, not only because of his stunning work as a whole, but his honesty in the role. He appears to be baring his soul in this movie, while still keeping a subtle demeanor. Susan Lynch was equally wonderful, but in a totally different way. Her performance was quick and full of life, as opposed to McGregor's dead-but-powerful approach. It was almost as though the role was a shell around the actress, and she became a totally new person, wholly leaving her personal self behind, forgetting any method of acting she may have had, any sense of mechanical acting in her is gone, and she allowed herself to just be this character.A lovely portrayl of one of the most passionate and stormy literary relationships in history, I highly recommend it.",5,Beautifully done,1024876800,"06 24, 2002",2002,1749,"['watched', 'Nora', 'lot', 'things', 'went', 'head', 'stellar', 'performance', 'given', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'quiet', 'power', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'strength', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'maturity', 'movie', 'whole', 'showed', 'noticed', 'was', 'virtually', 'lead-in', 'relationship', 'Nora', 'James', 'Joyce', 'total', '3', 'minutes', 'introduce', 'Nora', 'perhaps', '20', 'seconds', 'introduce', 'Mr.', 'Joyce', 'first', 'was', 'slightly', 'put', 'off', 'feeling', 'had', 'been', 'cheated', 'good', '15', 'minutes', 'story', 'progressed', 'realized', 'longer', 'introduction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'meaningless', 'end', 'waste', 'moviegoers', 'time', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'relationship', 'James', 'Nora', 'not', 'families', 'not', 'jobs', 'not', 'children', 'things', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'lives', 'therefore', 'impact', 'how', 'act', 'one', 'solely', '*them*.Ewan', 'McGregor', 'shocking', 'portrayl', 'not', 'only', 'stunning', 'work', 'whole', 'honesty', 'role', 'be', 'baring', 'soul', 'movie', 'still', 'keeping', 'subtle', 'demeanor', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'was', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'totally', 'different', 'way', 'performance', 'was', 'quick', 'full', 'life', 'opposed', 'McGregor', 'dead-but-powerful', 'approach', 'was', 'almost', 'role', 'was', 'shell', 'actress', 'became', 'totally', 'new', 'person', 'wholly', 'leaving', 'personal', 'self', 'forgetting', 'method', 'acting', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'sense', 'mechanical', 'acting', 'gone', 'allowed', 'just', 'be', 'character.A', 'lovely', 'portrayl', 'one', 'most', 'passionate', 'stormy', 'literary', 'relationships', 'history', 'highly', 'recommend']",Nora

The film is an idealized period pice about their relationship.Apart fom being one of the twentieth centuries most influential writers, Joyce was also one of the most cerebral.  Nora was his complement-a salty, earthy, uneducated, unrepressed Irish girl.  I don't think the film brought out the contrast between the two, enough.  In Nora, the church, intellect, and Victorian cursed Joyce found the passionate, lusty, unrepressed Ireland that he felt should have been.  Cerebral literary critics like to think Nora was a major source of Joyce's inspiritation.The matrimonial issue of what movie to rent, is what will I and the Missus both like enough?  With the Missus, the words boring and Irish movie usually occur in the same breath.  I warned her this would be a REAL boring Irish movie.The first half held it's own.  I detected interest on the Missus' part, and she wouldn't know James Joyce from somebody at the saloon on the corner.  As much as she denies it, she is always drawn in by a strong female role.  The middle and later parts of the film get into details of James's and Nora's life in Continental Europe.  It is not very dramatic, at least not for me.What's of interst in James Joyce is what went on inside his head, but that is hard to show in a movie!  It was by marriage to Nora that James tried to complete himself.I think that Nora's character was done a little too stiff, a little too Victorian proper.

""Nora"" covers the Joyces courtship in Dublin, immigration, and their years in Trieste until 1914 when ""Dubliners"" was finally published. McGregor may not be perfectly cast - he's heavier, and not much of a tenor - Joyce, on the other hand, was so renowned for his singing that he briefly contemplated making a career out of it. Ewan's very earnest in his attempt, though, he gets an A for effort. Susan Lynch makes a great Nora, no complaints there.Some of the chronology is played around with - the Prezioso episode happened after James and Nora's last mutual visit to Galway, not before. Two of Joyce's sisters are conflated into one, and the family's stint in Rome is omitted. Some episodes are invented for the sake of exposition, such as the run-in with the cattle in Dublin. Those are minor quibbles. The film got many details right - not the least of which was how elegantly the couple always tried to dress despite their relative lack of funds. Trieste hasn't changed much since early 20th century, so we also get to see some nice location shots - and a few in Dublin.I was a bit disappointed that the film ended at an early cutoff point, after James and Nora's first decade together.
