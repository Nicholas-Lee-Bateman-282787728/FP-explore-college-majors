The movie brings to front the hush and hidden denials of many relationships. It causes the viewer to question their own responsibility for friends or relatives, who they suspect may be in relationships that are abusive. It is a must see for everyone. Because everyone in someway will see their own reflection, some which they may wish not to acknowledge.",5,Outstanding Performance and Storyline!,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,445,"['performances', 'actor', 'were', 'as', 'powerful', 'message', 'movies', 'subject', 'line', 'movie', 'front', 'hush', 'hidden', 'denials', 'many', 'relationships', 'viewer', 'question', 'own', 'responsibility', 'friends', 'relatives', 'who', 'suspect', 'may', 'be', 'relationships', 'are', 'abusive', 'must', 'see', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'someway', 'will', 'see', 'own', 'reflection', 'may', 'wish', 'not', 'acknowledge']",Blues for Willadean
1680073,ACIMDUGLJR99V,B00GP382YC,"Craig - Indian Wells, CA","[16, 17]","This is a moving, touching, scary, funny and all-around great movie that tugs at your emotions from the writer/director of Sordid Lives, Del Shores. This is NOT Sordid Lives and does not try to be. There are funny moments as only Del Shores can intertwine needed comedy relief into a very dark and, often, hidden subject: Spousal Abuse. Beth Grant is stupendous as the abused wife of a blue collar worker-husband played ruthlessly and brilliantly by David Steen. He is whoring all around with the likes of a barmaid and neighbor played by one of my favorites, Dale Dickey. Willadean is helped by her other neighbor LaSonia played with compassion, love and a bit of comedy by Oscar winner, Octavia Spencer. And, how can there be a review of this movie without the beautiful songs sung by that incredibly talented, Debby Holiday. Her beautiful singing brings more emotions to the movie and poignant melody to the story. The movie will make you cry, it will make you laugh, it will make you gasp, but it will hold you until that moment that you need to look for when Willadean knows things have changed. Beth Grant's moment in the movie. I highly recommend this film. It addresses a problem in this country that we refuse to acknowledge, especially how brutal it can be. Many were disappointed that it wasn't another Sordid Lives. I was glad to see the range of writing and directing of Del Shores. It is a must see!

While the acting is solid, it does seem to suffer a bit in the transition.  First of all, it was ill advised to use the segments with Debby Holiday popping in to belt out her soulful songs.  These worked in the play, and she IS a wonderful singer, but here the performances are just jarring, like something tacked on.  The tone of the movie really suffers from these intrusive sequences, and I would really give it only about 3 1/2 stars if that was an option.The second problem I see with the film is that the director seemed to be searching for the tone.  Beth Grant's portrayal of her character suffers a bit from this.  The subject matter is quite serious, and I had a hard time buying into her character's overused device of saying, &#34;I will not disappear!&#34;  It somehow just didn't fit here as well as in the play.  Too bad, because Grant is a powerhouse actress, and she killed it in every single scene onstage.  The inclusion of Octavia Spencer was one of the reasons Grant's performance doesn't veer into the territory of caricature.  As someone else noted on here, she grounds every scene she's in. Still, it is a quite enjoyable movie.",4,"Better on stage, but still powerful despite tone problems...",1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,1276,"['Having', 'seen', 'onstage', 'L.A.', 'Zephyr', 'Theatre', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'filmed', 'adaptation', 'play', 'acting', 'solid', 'seem', 'suffer', 'bit', 'transition', 'First', 'all', 'was', 'ill', 'advised', 'use', 'segments', 'Debby', 'Holiday', 'popping', 'belt', 'out', 'soulful', 'songs', 'worked', 'play', 'wonderful', 'singer', 'here', 'performances', 'are', 'just', 'jarring', 'something', 'tacked', 'tone', 'movie', 'really', 'suffers', 'intrusive', 'sequences', 'would', 'really', 'give', 'only', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'was', 'option.The', 'second', 'problem', 'see', 'film', 'director', 'seemed', 'be', 'searching', 'tone', 'Beth', 'Grant', 'portrayal', 'character', 'bit', 'subject', 'matter', 'quite', 'serious', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'buying', 'character', 'overused', 'device', 'saying', '34', 'will', 'not', 'disappear', '34', 'somehow', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'play', 'Too', 'bad', 'Grant', 'powerhouse', 'actress', 'killed', 'single', 'scene', 'onstage', 'inclusion', 'Octavia', 'Spencer', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'Grant', 'performance', ""n't"", 'veer', 'territory', 'caricature', 'someone', 'else', 'noted', 'here', 'scene', 'Still', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",Blues for Willadean

What a powerful movie portrayed by several grossly overlooked actors/actresses.  First, Beth Grant, the lovable Aunt Sissy from Sordid Lives, gives a riveting performance as Willadean Winkler.  Dale Dickey beautifully portrays the &#34;tramp with a heart,&#34; Rayleen.  (And, by the way, Dale is the actress I think I'd most like to hang out with!  I know she'd be a riot because you just can't pull a character like Rayleen out of thin air!)  And, how can I not mention David Steen, who plays the despicable, J D Winkler.  Shores brings these characters to life in ways you immediately identify with.  Being a child of the deep south, I totally get where Shores is coming from and easily felt the silent rage and destitution of poor Willadean.  Sordid Lives was comedic, all about laughter and fun and looking at life from the happy side.  Blues for Willadean is somewhere between a drama and a tragedy, about overcoming unspeakable odds and meanness.  It's about hope and survival.  When I told Del (via email) I was looking forward to seeing Beth Grant again, his reply was, &#34;Well, this is a side of Beth I'll bet you've never seen before.&#34;  Man, was he right.  This movie shows a depth in all three actors/actresses [mentioned above], that I suspect many have never seen before.  Outstanding movie!  And, best of all, filmed entirely in my home state of Georgia!
