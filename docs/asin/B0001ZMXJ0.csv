Why, jealousy and murder, of course!!  But who committed the murder?  How do you punish the guilty party when you would also have to throw the innocent sister into jail?  What does one twin do while the other one is on a date?  These questions and more are addressed in this amazing film which will leave your jaw hanging down to knee level.Unfortunately, the film has little plot and is filled with a lot of padding, but where else will you see a film about jealousy and murder starring real conjoined twins?",5,Good Taste Gone Bad,1085875200,"05 30, 2004",2004,667,"['What', 'when', 'one', 'pair', 'conjoined', 'sisters', 'played', 'real-life', 'Hilton', 'twins', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'Freaks', 'love', 'cad', 'Why', 'jealousy', 'murder', 'course', 'who', 'committed', 'murder', 'How', 'do', 'punish', 'guilty', 'party', 'when', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'throw', 'innocent', 'sister', 'jail', 'What', 'one', 'twin', 'do', 'other', 'one', 'date', 'questions', 'more', 'are', 'addressed', 'amazing', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'jaw', 'hanging', 'down', 'knee', 'level.Unfortunately', 'film', 'little', 'plot', 'filled', 'lot', 'padding', 'where', 'else', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'jealousy', 'murder', 'starring', 'real', 'conjoined', 'twins']",N/A

Sizzleless exploiter featuring the Hilton sisters (of Freaks fame), posed as a courtroom drama centering on wether a judge can sentence both sisters for a murder only one comitted. Yes, there's the obligitory square up at the end, as silly as any of em. The dream sequence is sufficeintly weird, with Daisy being stunt doubled except for her close ups peeking through the tree. Oh, and there's a bumbling plate juggler, an organ played by rifle shots and a blind preacher waxing boringly about nature not ""granting favors"". The Hiltons sing a few songs.

818775,A2LC8OZEYOSUAY,B0001ZMXJ0,"D. Perl ""Dragon""","[10, 12]","The quality of the film ""Chained for Life"" is certainly among the worst that I have ever viewed.  The picture is washed out and choppy.  One may wonder why the time has not been taken to restore this bit of sideshow/vaudeville history.  According to the excellent biography ""The Lives and Loves of Daisy and Violet Hilton,"" this is the film that finally ruined them.  The Hilton Sisters had high hopes that this project would make them superstars.  They paid almost all of their own money to produce this story about one twin committing homicide and the legal problems  the situation would cause.  ""Must the innocent be punished with the guilty, or should the guilty go free?""  This idea lost focus even before the first day of its filming.  After rewrites and reediting to please the censors of the day, ""Chained for Life"" became a blur of ideas with no real conclusion and unknown bad actors.  It is an uneven film, with no real plot, and out of place musical performances by Daisy and Violet.The film was locked in litigation, upon it completion, for a year (due to unpaid production bills).  ""Chained for Life"" ended up with a very limited release in hick towns where small audiences hated the film.  The Hilton Sisters traveled from cheap theaters to drive-ins across the country trying to promote their film.  In the end, Daisy and Violet  took a tremendous financial loss.  This was the beginning of the final end for the Hilton Sisters.  They would never recover from the financial loss caused by this venture and would end up living their remaining years in poverty.The DVD ""Chained for Life"" is cheap label discount release(Alpha).  It is a washed out, bad print of the high hopes that ended up being the final ruin of Daisy and Violet Hilton.  It is a bad film, and a sad ending to the once famous vaudeville headliners whose lives ended in tragedy.  Those who have read ""The Lives and Loves of Daisy and Violet Hilton: A True Story of Conjoined Twins by Dean Jensen,"" may find the DVD interesting for historical reasons. Those who know nothing of the Hilton Sisters will only see ""Chained for Life"" as a cinematic failure.",2,"On A Historical Note, This Film Runed the Hilton Sisters.",1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,2134,"['quality', 'film', 'Chained', 'Life', 'certainly', 'worst', 'have', 'ever', 'viewed', 'picture', 'washed', 'out', 'choppy', 'One', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'taken', 'restore', 'bit', 'sideshow/vaudeville', 'history', 'According', 'excellent', 'biography', 'Lives', 'Loves', 'Daisy', 'Violet', 'Hilton', 'film', 'finally', 'ruined', 'Hilton', 'Sisters', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'project', 'would', 'make', 'superstars', 'paid', 'almost', 'own', 'money', 'produce', 'story', 'one', 'twin', 'committing', 'homicide', 'legal', 'problems', 'situation', 'would', 'cause', 'Must', 'innocent', 'be', 'punished', 'guilty', 'should', 'guilty', 'go', 'free', 'idea', 'lost', 'focus', 'even', 'first', 'day', 'filming', 'rewrites', 'reediting', 'please', 'censors', 'day', 'Chained', 'Life', 'became', 'blur', 'ideas', 'real', 'conclusion', 'unknown', 'bad', 'actors', 'uneven', 'film', 'real', 'plot', 'place', 'musical', 'performances', 'Daisy', 'Violet.The', 'film', 'was', 'locked', 'litigation', 'completion', 'year', 'due', 'unpaid', 'production', 'bills', 'Chained', 'Life', 'ended', 'up', 'very', 'limited', 'release', 'hick', 'towns', 'where', 'small', 'audiences', 'hated', 'film', 'Hilton', 'Sisters', 'traveled', 'cheap', 'theaters', 'drive-ins', 'country', 'trying', 'promote', 'film', 'end', 'Daisy', 'Violet', 'took', 'tremendous', 'financial', 'loss', 'was', 'beginning', 'final', 'end', 'Hilton', 'Sisters', 'would', 'never', 'recover', 'financial', 'loss', 'caused', 'venture', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'remaining', 'years', 'poverty.The', 'DVD', 'Chained', 'Life', 'cheap', 'label', 'discount', 'release', 'Alpha', 'washed', 'out', 'bad', 'print', 'high', 'hopes', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'final', 'ruin', 'Daisy', 'Violet', 'Hilton', 'bad', 'film', 'sad', 'ending', 'once', 'famous', 'vaudeville', 'headliners', 'lives', 'ended', 'tragedy', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'Lives', 'Loves', 'Daisy', 'Violet', 'Hilton', 'True', 'Story', 'Conjoined', 'Twins', 'Dean', 'Jensen', 'may', 'find', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'historical', 'reasons', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Hilton', 'Sisters', 'will', 'only', 'see', 'Chained', 'Life', 'cinematic', 'failure']",N/A
818776,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B0001ZMXJ0,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[3, 3]","I found this movie quite fascinating, primarily because it shows the mature Hilton Siamise Twins--Violet and Daisy--in their later years, long after their appearance in the l932 MGM film, ""Freaks.""For a grindhouse exploitation movie, the production values are higher than usual, with a fairly large cast, different sets and flattering photograph of the two stars. However, this is what is so depressing about this effort: both women look like they're well into their 40s or early 50s.Neither can act, since their vaudeville act was always just the two of them singing bland, forgettable songs. in fact, the movie often looks like an Ed Sullivan variety show--with endless and boring vaudeville acts. The male lead is so smarmy and sleazy that it's no wonder he vanished soon after the movie finally appeared in very limited showings.Because of various legal battles and because the twins sunk all their small fortune into making this movie, Daisy and Violet ended up in poverty. they were so certain this movie would catapult them into major stardom which may indicate how totally out of touch they were from reality.This movie was among the 20 in the fantastic boxed collection from Mill Creek called 20 Cult movies. You watch this one and the others and can appreciate more what the Hilton girls were trying to accomplish. When they died in poverty and obscurity, they were probably certain they had been forgotten. With the advent of home video, however, they're now being seen today and even appreciated.  After watching them in this effort, one has to admit that it's been like watching two, rather boring, housewives who somehow found themselves in front of a camera. One wishes they had somehow found understanding spouses and settled down somewhere and left the stage while at the top of their game.",3,Fascinating antique!,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,1807,"['found', 'movie', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'primarily', 'mature', 'Hilton', 'Siamise', 'Twins', 'Violet', 'Daisy', 'later', 'years', 'long', 'appearance', 'l932', 'MGM', 'film', 'Freaks', 'grindhouse', 'exploitation', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'higher', 'usual', 'fairly', 'large', 'cast', 'different', 'sets', 'flattering', 'photograph', 'two', 'stars', 'However', 'what', 'so', 'depressing', 'effort', 'women', 'look', ""'re"", 'well', '40s', 'early', '50s.Neither', 'can', 'act', 'vaudeville', 'act', 'was', 'always', 'just', 'two', 'singing', 'bland', 'forgettable', 'songs', 'fact', 'movie', 'often', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'variety', 'show', 'endless', 'boring', 'vaudeville', 'acts', 'male', 'lead', 'so', 'smarmy', 'wonder', 'vanished', 'soon', 'movie', 'finally', 'appeared', 'very', 'limited', 'showings.Because', 'various', 'legal', 'battles', 'twins', 'sunk', 'small', 'fortune', 'making', 'movie', 'Daisy', 'Violet', 'ended', 'up', 'poverty', 'were', 'so', 'certain', 'movie', 'would', 'catapult', 'major', 'stardom', 'may', 'indicate', 'how', 'totally', 'touch', 'were', 'reality.This', 'movie', 'was', '20', 'fantastic', 'boxed', 'collection', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'called', '20', 'Cult', 'movies', 'watch', 'one', 'others', 'can', 'appreciate', 'more', 'what', 'Hilton', 'girls', 'were', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'When', 'died', 'poverty', 'obscurity', 'were', 'probably', 'certain', 'had', 'been', 'forgotten', 'advent', 'home', 'video', 'however', ""'re"", 'now', 'being', 'seen', 'today', 'even', 'appreciated', 'watching', 'effort', 'one', 'admit', 'been', 'watching', 'two', 'rather', 'boring', 'housewives', 'who', 'somehow', 'found', 'front', 'camera', 'One', 'had', 'somehow', 'found', 'understanding', 'spouses', 'settled', 'down', 'somewhere', 'left', 'stage', 'top', 'game']",N/A

The movie is serious and well made if one views it with  fascination for the people in it. There  are some fine songs sung by the sisters.  They really had vocal talent. They might  have been classic performers if supported by Hollywood star makers.There are several fine vaudeville acts by a very talented man.It's not modern entertainment by any means; but it has a certain beauty and pathos that's worth a few bucks if you have feeling for long gone people and cinema.,4,This is a real movie,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,604,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'apply', 'today', 'sorry', 'moral', 'standards', '1951', 'was', 'shocked', 'discover', 'pitiful', 'duo', 'really', 'did', 'exist', 'movie', 'serious', 'well', 'made', 'one', 'fascination', 'people', 'are', 'fine', 'songs', 'sung', 'sisters', 'really', 'had', 'vocal', 'talent', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'performers', 'supported', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'are', 'several', 'fine', 'vaudeville', 'acts', 'very', 'talented', 'man.It', 'not', 'modern', 'entertainment', 'means', 'certain', 'beauty', 'pathos', 'few', 'bucks', 'have', 'feeling', 'long', 'gone', 'people', 'cinema']",N/A

Molthan,"[7, 7]","This DVD release is mastered from a VHS dub copy of a 16mm dupe print, so no wonder the sound is horribly distorted (as many have pointed out), and the detail of the picture is washed out. You can see the squiggly videotape artifacts from the minute the opening credits start. In brighter scenes, you can barely see any detail of some of the characters' faces (this is evidence that the original source was a dupe of a positive print rather than a positive print made from a negative) and this probably explains the poor sound as well. Then, the dub to videotape further degraded the quality. If Alpha Video couldn't come up with better source material, they should've passed on this title. Considering this film's obscurity, I wasn't expecting miracles, but this is one of the worst DVD releases I've come across.
