But the most irritating thing BY FAR was that this was a total Christian recruitment film. In the end it was all about how pagans are lost and confused and that Jesus is the answer to everything.

1570638,A1Q3GEO516I4VK,B008MXMGJ0,Twisted Slasher,"[9, 10]","So, here's another movie about demonic possession that features a demon who loves to taunt the characters while laughing maniacally and features at least one instance of the heroes saying, ""The power of Christ COMPELS you!""First off, if you're basing your desire to see this off the awesome cover, don't.  The creepy looking chick on the cover is NOT in the movie, at all.  Damn, there's been so many horrible horror movies lately that feature really good cover art.  That creepy demon girl is the one who made me want to see this movie.  Instead, it's a dude who is the vessel for this otherwise unseen demon.The movie features teenagers going to a morgue to film a girl performing a seance there.  I'm not sure why, but I'm sure it doesn't matter.  Anyway, of course there's a demon there and it infiltrates the body of the resident douche bag, who promptly rips his shirt off to provide eye candy for the female audience, I guess.  The rest of the movie features the two main girls keeping him tied down and trying to exorcise the spirit.  This is where the movie gets rather humorous as the demon constantly injures the girls during their exorcism attempts and they keep going back to the same room to regroup and try again.The film is shot decently and the actors aren't that bad.  The villain clearly hams it up playing the demon, but it's a fun performance regardless.  There are some decent set pieces and it's nice that the film references Christianity a lot, for those who are religious like myself.  The dialogue is the highlight of the movie; it is so bad it elevates this from boring trash to slightly entertaining trash.  See it if you must, but pay no more than a dollar to do so.  Oh, and if you hate rats, avoid this film like the plague.",2,BLAHAHAHAHA,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1755,"['So', 'here', 'movie', 'demonic', 'possession', 'demon', 'who', 'taunt', 'characters', 'laughing', 'maniacally', 'features', 'least', 'one', 'instance', 'heroes', 'saying', 'power', 'Christ', 'COMPELS', 'First', 'off', ""'re"", 'basing', 'desire', 'see', 'off', 'awesome', 'cover', 'do', ""n't"", 'creepy', 'looking', 'chick', 'cover', 'NOT', 'movie', 'Damn', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'horrible', 'horror', 'movies', 'lately', 'feature', 'really', 'good', 'cover', 'art', 'creepy', 'demon', 'girl', 'one', 'who', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'Instead', 'dude', 'who', 'vessel', 'otherwise', 'unseen', 'demon.The', 'movie', 'teenagers', 'going', 'morgue', 'film', 'girl', 'performing', 'seance', 'there', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', ""'m"", 'sure', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Anyway', 'course', 'demon', 'there', 'body', 'resident', 'douche', 'bag', 'who', 'promptly', 'shirt', 'provide', 'eye', 'candy', 'female', 'audience', 'guess', 'rest', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'girls', 'keeping', 'tied', 'down', 'trying', 'exorcise', 'spirit', 'where', 'movie', 'rather', 'humorous', 'demon', 'constantly', 'girls', 'exorcism', 'attempts', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'same', 'room', 'regroup', 'try', 'again.The', 'film', 'shot', 'decently', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'villain', 'clearly', 'up', 'playing', 'demon', 'fun', 'performance', 'regardless', 'are', 'decent', 'set', 'pieces', 'nice', 'film', 'references', 'Christianity', 'lot', 'who', 'are', 'religious', 'dialogue', 'highlight', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'boring', 'trash', 'slightly', 'entertaining', 'trash', 'See', 'must', 'pay', 'more', 'dollar', 'do', 'so', 'Oh', 'hate', 'rats', 'avoid', 'film', 'plague']",N/A
