The movie is rated PG-13 because of some nudity but other than that it is perfect for children to watch. The main idea of the movie is that the kind Bobby Buchea is put in a predicament when his mother does not want him to play football. Although the movie was hilarious the visual effects were only mediocre, this having to do with the time period in which it was made. The movie was a perfect  length and is a great movie to watch on a rainy day.Adam Sandler does a fantastic job as Bobby Buchea from when he is making jokes on the field while other people are ""making fun of him"" to when he falls in love with an ex-con. Henry Wrinkler who plays the head coach of the Mud Dogs does a good job when he hallucinates and when he talks to Bobby before each game. Jerry Reed who plays the ex partner of ""The Fonz""(Henry Wrinkler) is great when he insults Bobby and when he calls him a ""mommas boy"" and that he is good for nothing.In the movie Bobby learns to overcome his social problems and wins the Burben Bowl for the Mud Dogs. This is a lesson to be taught, that if you give something your all you can achieve anything. The actors do a fine job portraying this and overall they are a great cast who played each part well.

I'd rank it in my top ten funny movies of my collection and it features one of my favorite characters in film: Bobby Boucher Jr., a heckuva lot nicer guy than Sandler's ""Happy Gilmore.""""Bobby"" is about as innocent and a gentle-natured a guy as you'll find this side of Forrest Gump. You can't help but root for him, and that's the idea. What the film basically involves is another ""Revenge Of The Nerds"" theme except it's ""nerd ""- singular - as the picked-on waterboy turning the tables on the football jocks. Interesting to once again see Jerry Reed, whom I haven't seen much of since his days in ""Smokey And The Bandit."" He has much fatter face but everything else looked the same. Then there is Henry Winkler, ""The Fonz"" who now is the opposite: a guy with a terrible inferiority complex. All the characters in here are wildly exaggerated.This cartoon-like comedy may not be high-brow, but so what? It's not totally low- brow either, but I do wonder why modern filmmakers cannot seem to make a comedy without all the sex references and the profanity. Nonetheless, Sandler's Cajun accent, his strange-looking-but pretty girlfriend (Fairuza Balk) and crazy mother (Kathy Bates, in the funniest role she's ever played) are all great fun to watch.It's silly, particularly the ridiculous climactic football game, but then this movie is hardly to be taken seriously.

It is the perfect answer for a bad day, as not only is it hilarious and uplifting, it lets you take out some of your own pent-up aggression with each powerful hit Bobby Boucher (Sandler) makes out on the football field.  Bobby represents everyone who has ever been excluded, picked on, or ridiculed.  While he is not an intellectual giant and does not possess what you call people skills, his kind and simple nature makes him a man among men even before he finds stardom on the gridiron.  The boy certainly loves his mama, and Kathy Bates shines in her role as the overprotective, quirky, slightly touched in the head Helen Boucher.  If anyone ever questioned Bates' ability to do comedy, this movie should banish all doubts.  Fairuza Balk is strangely beguiling as Vicki Vallencourt, a ""bad girl"" who has long had an interest in Bobby over his mother&#65533;s objections, and the two make a really strange yet somehow logical couple.  Bobby&#65533;s mother describes Vicki as ""the devil,"" but of course she considers just about every person on the planet besides herself and Bobby to be ""the devil.""Bobby&#65533;s real passion in life is his job as waterboy for the local college football team, a real powerhouse coached by Coach Red Beaulieu (Jerry Reed).  When he gets fired, he goes seeking water management employment at South Central Louisiana State University, a legendarily bad team coached by Coach Klein, a very un-Fonzie-like Henry Winkler.  When Coach Klein convinces Bobby to defend himself against the taunts of team members, he finds himself looking at a natural-born linebacker.  Mama does not want her son playing ""foosball,"" but what Mama does not know won't hurt her (Bobby ingeniously blames all of the cuts and scrapes he acquires during the season on an escaped gorilla).  He records a record-shattering sixteen quarterback sacks in his first game, drawing national attention from the real-life sportscasters of ESPN.  A magical season unfolds at SCLSU, setting up a Bourbon Bowl meeting of the little college who could and mean old Coach Beaulieu&#65533;s undefeated championship squad.  At this point, certain complications arise, a secret history between Coaches Beaulieu and Klein is revealed, and SCLSU's dream season stands on the point of suddenly becoming a nightmare.This is not a high-brow comedy, but there is nothing wrong with corny comedy as long as it is funny, and The Waterboy is, to repeat myself, hilarious.  Football fans will definitely get a kick out of the way Bobby just destroys his opponents on the field, using several moves that you will not see in the NFL any time soon in the process (certainly not more than once).  Perhaps overlooked in the midst of all the comedy is a more serious theme, however.  This movie is a story of overcoming obstacles, believing in yourself, and redemption, not just for the ultimate underdog Bobby Boucher but for his mother, Coach Klein, and several other characters.  You almost have to feel pumped up and happy in the end, and that counts for a lot in and of itself.  Sometimes the good guys do come out on top, or so most of us like to believe in order to get through each day.  The Waterboy helps us keep our faith and inspires us to rise above all of the bad things in life and concentrate on such simple yet important matters as family, friendship, love, and always doing your best.",5,A feel-good comedy featuring Sandler at his funniest,1058918400,"07 23, 2003",2003,3557,"['Wedding', 'Singer', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'Waterboy', 'far', 'funniest', 'think', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'watch', 'perfect', 'answer', 'bad', 'day', 'not', 'only', 'hilarious', 'uplifting', 'take', 'out', 'own', 'pent-up', 'aggression', 'powerful', 'hit', 'Bobby', 'Boucher', 'Sandler', 'out', 'football', 'field', 'Bobby', 'everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'excluded', 'picked', 'ridiculed', 'not', 'intellectual', 'giant', 'not', 'possess', 'what', 'call', 'people', 'skills', 'kind', 'simple', 'nature', 'man', 'men', 'even', 'stardom', 'gridiron', 'boy', 'certainly', 'mama', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'shines', 'role', 'overprotective', 'quirky', 'slightly', 'touched', 'head', 'Helen', 'Boucher', 'anyone', 'ever', 'questioned', 'Bates', 'ability', 'do', 'comedy', 'movie', 'should', 'banish', 'doubts', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'strangely', 'beguiling', 'Vicki', 'Vallencourt', 'bad', 'girl', 'who', 'long', 'had', 'interest', 'Bobby', 'mother', '65533', 's', 'objections', 'two', 'make', 'really', 'strange', 'yet', 'somehow', 'logical', 'couple', 'Bobby', '65533', 's', 'mother', 'describes', 'Vicki', 'devil', 'course', 'just', 'about', 'person', 'planet', 'herself', 'Bobby', 'be', 'devil', 'Bobby', '65533', 's', 'real', 'passion', 'life', 'job', 'waterboy', 'local', 'college', 'football', 'team', 'real', 'powerhouse', 'coached', 'Coach', 'Red', 'Beaulieu', 'Jerry', 'Reed', 'When', 'fired', 'seeking', 'water', 'management', 'employment', 'South', 'Central', 'Louisiana', 'State', 'University', 'legendarily', 'bad', 'team', 'coached', 'Coach', 'Klein', 'very', 'un-Fonzie-like', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'When', 'Coach', 'Klein', 'Bobby', 'defend', 'taunts', 'team', 'members', 'looking', 'natural-born', 'linebacker', 'Mama', 'not', 'want', 'son', 'playing', 'foosball', 'what', 'Mama', 'not', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Bobby', 'ingeniously', 'cuts', 'scrapes', 'season', 'escaped', 'gorilla', 'record-shattering', 'sixteen', 'quarterback', 'sacks', 'first', 'game', 'drawing', 'national', 'attention', 'real-life', 'sportscasters', 'ESPN', 'A', 'magical', 'season', 'unfolds', 'SCLSU', 'setting', 'up', 'Bourbon', 'Bowl', 'meeting', 'little', 'college', 'who', 'could', 'mean', 'old', 'Coach', 'Beaulieu', '65533', 's', 'undefeated', 'championship', 'squad', 'point', 'certain', 'complications', 'arise', 'secret', 'history', 'Coaches', 'Beaulieu', 'Klein', 'revealed', 'SCLSU', 'dream', 'season', 'point', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'nightmare.This', 'not', 'high-brow', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'corny', 'comedy', 'as', 'long', 'funny', 'Waterboy', 'repeat', 'hilarious', 'Football', 'fans', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'kick', 'way', 'Bobby', 'just', 'opponents', 'field', 'using', 'several', 'moves', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'NFL', 'time', 'soon', 'process', 'certainly', 'not', 'more', 'once', 'Perhaps', 'overlooked', 'midst', 'comedy', 'more', 'serious', 'theme', 'however', 'movie', 'story', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'believing', 'redemption', 'not', 'just', 'ultimate', 'underdog', 'Bobby', 'Boucher', 'mother', 'Coach', 'Klein', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'almost', 'have', 'feel', 'pumped', 'up', 'happy', 'end', 'counts', 'lot', 'Sometimes', 'good', 'guys', 'do', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'so', 'most', 'believe', 'order', 'get', 'day', 'Waterboy', 'keep', 'faith', 'rise', 'bad', 'things', 'life', 'concentrate', 'such', 'simple', 'yet', 'important', 'matters', 'family', 'friendship', 'love', 'always', 'doing', 'best']",N/A

81932,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0788816454,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[15, 17]","Back in 1998, comedian Adam Sandler was coming from a string of solid box office hits such as ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""The Wedding Singer"".Sandler would return with ""THE WATERBOY"", a film that proved that despite how crude the humor a film may be, people just want to laugh and have a good time.  And sure enough, the film would rake in over $160 million dollars in the US and signified Adam Sandler as box office draw.The film was directed by Frank Coraci (director of ""The Wedding Singer"", ""Around the World in 80 Days"" and ""Click) and a screenplay by Sandler and Tim Herlihy (""Bedtime Stories"", ""Mr. Deeds"", ""Little Nicky"", ""Big Daddy"" and ""The Wedding Singer"").  Also, featuring music by Alan Pasqua and cinematography by Steven Bernstein (""Corky Romano"", ""Scary Movie 2' and ""Bulletproof"").VIDEO & AUDIO:""THE WATERBOY"" receives its first 1080p High Definition transfer (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and for a film made eleven years ago, the film looks great on Blu-ray.  With a large part of the film shot outdoors, you can see the bright colors from the various football teams to natural skin tones for the characters.  Day time scenes in particular reveal plenty of the film's fine details across the board. You can also pick up a lot of detail from the grass on the football field, to the griminess of the run down home that Bobby's mother lives in and more.  Vivid contrast gives daytime exteriors and low-lit interiors a really good amount of depth. Blanks are are nice and deep.As for the soundtrack, ""THE WATERBOY"" sports a lossless English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack (also French 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital).  Although primarily a dialogue-driven film that uses the center channel and is heard clearly, there is occasional music that utilizes the front channel speakers.  It's not until you start getting into the football games where the team gets more of an audience and scenes with crowds, where you hear the surrounds being utilized.  The film doesn't have an immersive soundtrack compared to other sports-based films on Blu-ray but the audio is nice and clear and overall, satisfactory for this film.As expected from a Disney release (via Touchstone Home Entertainment) on Blu-ray, the transfer is gorgeous.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are no special features included on this Blu-ray release of ""The Waterboy"".JUDGMENT CALL:""THE WATERBOY"" is one of those films that people will either love or hate it.  Since this is one of the earlier Adam Sandler films, he has a nack of playing parts that are just outrageously funny but at the same time, some people may find it too idiotic for their taste.  So, suffice to say, if you are the latter, more than likely this film is not going to appeal to you.But for those who have enjoyed his films, ""THE WATERBOY"" is just hilarious and is a Sandler classic!Adam Sandler's ""Bobby Boucher"" is a stuttering mama's boy that is definitely going to make you laugh.  Granted, he has a speech impediment but its not his way of talking but the way he was raised, the way he thinks and although innocent, it just comes off as idiotic.The whole film just made me laugh and although people in Southern Louisiana may not like how they were characterized in this film (living in the swamp and eating dead animals, a hillbilly which no one knows what the heck he's saying as the assistant head coach and cheerleaders inebriated, a man who looks like Colonel Sanders as a professor, etc.), I guess if you can take this comedy and not be so serious about it, you can easily be amused.  Especially if you are a sports fan.The Blu-ray release of ""THE WATERBOY"" definitely has its positive marks for its HD transfer.  The picture quality and lossless audio are awesome but I was surprised there are no special features.  I would have loved to hear Coraci, Tim Herlihy or Adam Sandler come back and do an audio commentary or some sort of behind-the-scenes featurette.So, for those who own the previous DVD and are wondering if its worth the double dip, it all comes down to whether or not you want to watch the film in High Definition.Back then and even today, Adam Sandler films will be love or hate for many viewers but the sheer amount of outrageous comedy from this film is what made it so hilarious.  And for a film that came out in 1998, it manages to retain its humor and craziness eleven years later.""THE WATERBOY"" is just hilarious and crazy but overall, an enjoyable film on Blu-ray!",3,"Blu-ray: For those who love the film, will want this on Blu-ray but as a release, it's quite a barebones release...",1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,4427,"['Back', '1998', 'comedian', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'was', 'coming', 'string', 'solid', 'box', 'office', 'hits', 'such', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'Wedding', 'Singer', '.Sandler', 'would', 'return', 'WATERBOY', 'film', 'proved', 'how', 'crude', 'humor', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'people', 'just', 'want', 'laugh', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'sure', 'enough', 'film', 'would', 'rake', '160', 'million', 'dollars', 'US', 'signified', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'box', 'office', 'draw.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Coraci', 'director', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'World', '80', 'Days', 'Click', 'screenplay', 'Sandler', 'Tim', 'Herlihy', 'Bedtime', 'Stories', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Little', 'Nicky', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'Also', 'featuring', 'music', 'Alan', 'Pasqua', 'cinematography', 'Steven', 'Bernstein', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'Scary', 'Movie', '2', 'Bulletproof', '.VIDEO', 'AUDIO', 'WATERBOY', 'first', '1080p', 'High', 'Definition', 'transfer', '1:85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'film', 'made', 'eleven', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'great', 'Blu-ray', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'shot', 'outdoors', 'can', 'see', 'bright', 'colors', 'various', 'football', 'teams', 'natural', 'skin', 'tones', 'characters', 'Day', 'time', 'scenes', 'particular', 'reveal', 'plenty', 'film', 'fine', 'details', 'board', 'can', 'also', 'pick', 'up', 'lot', 'detail', 'grass', 'football', 'field', 'griminess', 'run', 'down', 'home', 'Bobby', 'mother', 'more', 'Vivid', 'contrast', 'daytime', 'exteriors', 'low-lit', 'interiors', 'really', 'good', 'amount', 'depth', 'Blanks', 'are', 'are', 'nice', 'deep.As', 'soundtrack', 'WATERBOY', 'sports', 'lossless', 'English', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'French', '5.1', 'Spanish', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'primarily', 'dialogue-driven', 'film', 'center', 'channel', 'heard', 'clearly', 'occasional', 'music', 'front', 'channel', 'speakers', 'not', 'start', 'getting', 'football', 'games', 'where', 'team', 'more', 'audience', 'scenes', 'crowds', 'where', 'hear', 'surrounds', 'being', 'utilized', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'immersive', 'soundtrack', 'compared', 'other', 'sports-based', 'films', 'Blu-ray', 'audio', 'nice', 'clear', 'overall', 'satisfactory', 'film.As', 'expected', 'Disney', 'release', 'Touchstone', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'gorgeous.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'Waterboy', '.JUDGMENT', 'CALL', 'WATERBOY', 'one', 'films', 'people', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'one', 'earlier', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films', 'nack', 'playing', 'parts', 'are', 'just', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'idiotic', 'taste', 'So', 'suffice', 'say', 'are', 'latter', 'more', 'likely', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'appeal', 'you.But', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'WATERBOY', 'just', 'hilarious', 'Sandler', 'classic', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Bobby', 'Boucher', 'stuttering', 'mama', 'boy', 'definitely', 'going', 'make', 'laugh', 'Granted', 'speech', 'impediment', 'not', 'way', 'talking', 'way', 'was', 'raised', 'way', 'innocent', 'just', 'off', 'idiotic.The', 'whole', 'film', 'just', 'made', 'laugh', 'people', 'Southern', 'Louisiana', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'how', 'were', 'characterized', 'film', 'living', 'swamp', 'eating', 'dead', 'animals', 'hillbilly', 'one', 'what', 'heck', 'saying', 'assistant', 'head', 'coach', 'cheerleaders', 'inebriated', 'man', 'who', 'Colonel', 'Sanders', 'professor', 'etc', 'guess', 'can', 'take', 'comedy', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'serious', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'amused', 'Especially', 'are', 'sports', 'fan.The', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'WATERBOY', 'definitely', 'positive', 'marks', 'HD', 'transfer', 'picture', 'quality', 'lossless', 'audio', 'are', 'awesome', 'was', 'surprised', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'hear', 'Coraci', 'Tim', 'Herlihy', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'come', 'back', 'do', 'audio', 'commentary', 'sort', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette.So', 'who', 'own', 'previous', 'DVD', 'are', 'wondering', 'worth', 'double', 'dip', 'down', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'High', 'Definition.Back', 'then', 'even', 'today', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'love', 'hate', 'many', 'viewers', 'sheer', 'amount', 'outrageous', 'comedy', 'film', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'hilarious', 'film', 'came', 'out', '1998', 'retain', 'humor', 'craziness', 'eleven', 'years', 'later', 'WATERBOY', 'just', 'hilarious', 'crazy', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Blu-ray']",N/A

This has to be one of my favorites from Sandler because it's a really funny movie plus there's a lot of football action and Sandler is hilarious in this movie.Sandler is Bobby Boucher, a 31 year old still living with his mama waterboy. Boucher gets fired from the big league university he was waterboy for and is then forced to find a new waterboy position and he finds his way to SCLSU (South Central Louisiana State University) and the SCLSU Mud Dawgs football. As soon as he gets there, it's the same situation... the players are picking on him. His coach (Henry Winkler) then tells Bobby to fight back or they'll do it forever. So with his coach's advice, Bobby fights back and shows his teammates who's boss. Winkler being impressed with Bobby's tackling ability when he's mad uses that and makes him their new starting Linebacker.Trutyhfully, Sandler stretched for this one because his character was unlike any of his orher characters. Sandler was funny in almost a DUmb and Dumber sense along with the on field comedy during the football games was also hilarious. I'd suggest this to anyone because it's a great movie for laughs and some good ole' football.If you're looking for other roles where Sandler is more than just a regualr guy (like in Big Daddy), check out LITTLE NICKY because that one is also very funny and Sandler makes an acting stretch for that role as well.

That would be distracting in a drama, but in a comedy it's a forgivable sin. I mean it's not like she's the DEVIL or anything!As an added bonus, the music throughout this movie is also fantastic!

Adam Sandler is at his silly, ""stupid comedy"" best playing Bobby Boucher, a Cajun recluse who has been a waterboy for one football team or another his entire life.  After losing his job, he eventually catches on with another team where his life changes dramatically.One day while perorming his waterboy duties, something he takes to ridiculously hilarious extremes, Bobby is abused by his new team.  His precious water gets spit in, he gets tackled, and everyone of the players makes fun of him.  With his old team, he had to endure the pain and ridicule without retaliation, but not with the new team.A star is born.Bobby eventually joins the team where he immediately, albeit inexplicably, becomes the starting linebacker.  Despite his lack of football knowledge, he ends up becoming one of the greatest forces in college football history.  He destroys everyone and everything on the opposing team, with highlight after highlight, using visualizations of all who have wronged him in the past to fuel his aggression.Waterboy is highly enjoyable, with classic Sandler, and tons of either comedy or action to satisfy all needs.  Henry Winkler is great in his role, bringing laughs whenever he's on-screen.  Kathy Bates is great as the near-psychotic mother,  a Col.

When he joins up with a team that has lost its last 40 games, he is able to channel his hurt into vicious tackles that start to turn the teams fortunes.The fun of the movie is the inspired performances of the supporting cast. There's Kathy Bates (in a comedic tour de force) as the over-protective Mama Boucher whose Cajun cuisine runs to crocs, snakes and squirrels. There's Henry Winkler, as the loser coach, who never recovered from losing his gridiron playbook to a rival.

Sandler created a very interesting character in Bobby Boucher.He goes to work for the Louisiana Mud Dogs where the Coach, played by Henry Winkler discovers a ""hidden talent"" in Bobby. When Bobby gets angry, he has the strength of twenty men so the coach makes Bobby a defensive tackler with the Bobby's condition that nobody tell his momma.In college Bobby learns that alligators are aggressive not because they ""have all these teeth and no toothbrush"" but because of the way their medulla oblongata is geared. He learns to have friends' outside of his momma. In other words, Bobby is growing up which is his momma's biggest fear because she is afraid that once he grows up, he won't need her, any more.It's actually a very sweet movie. What I really liked about this movie were the visualization scenes. The Coach has Bobby visualize his opposition as people who have made him angry in the past. There is this one scene where he sees the whole offensive line with Henry Winklers head on their shoulders singing, ""Water sucks...it really, really sucks...""You have to see it...it's hysterical.For the most part I review spiritual/metaphysical/philosophical books and movies, but I love films like this even though they may appear to have no ""redeemable"" aspects. Which is not true. I can find meaning and depth in everything. I'm not saying that The waterboy is a major philosophical triumph, but it does have meaning and depth even though it's primarily silly and highly bizarre...which is also good!I love this movie and even though I do not own this DVD, I do watch it every time it's on television. It does generate some hardy laughs and I appreciate it just for that!Peace & Blessings.",5,"Boy, Are You Playin' the Foozeball?",1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,2103,"['am', 'not', 'big', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'find', 'most', 'movies', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'boring', 'side', 'bizarre', 'reason', 'absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'just', 'bizarre.Adam', 'Sandler', 'Bobby', 'Boucher', 'pronounced', 'Bo-shay', 'not', 'exactly', 'sharpest', 'knife', 'drawer', 'thirties', 'momma', 'boy', 'career', 'being', 'professional', 'water', 'boy', 'Water', 'life', 'Sandler', 'created', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'Bobby', 'Boucher.He', 'work', 'Louisiana', 'Mud', 'Dogs', 'where', 'Coach', 'played', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'hidden', 'talent', 'Bobby', 'When', 'Bobby', 'angry', 'strength', 'twenty', 'men', 'coach', 'Bobby', 'defensive', 'tackler', 'Bobby', 'condition', 'nobody', 'tell', 'momma.In', 'college', 'Bobby', 'alligators', 'are', 'aggressive', 'not', 'have', 'teeth', 'toothbrush', 'way', 'medulla', 'oblongata', 'geared', 'have', 'friends', 'outside', 'momma', 'other', 'words', 'Bobby', 'growing', 'up', 'momma', 'biggest', 'fear', 'afraid', 'once', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'more.It', 'actually', 'very', 'sweet', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'were', 'visualization', 'scenes', 'Coach', 'Bobby', 'visualize', 'opposition', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'angry', 'past', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'whole', 'offensive', 'line', 'Henry', 'Winklers', 'head', 'shoulders', 'singing', 'Water', 'sucks', 'really', 'really', 'sucks', 'have', 'see', 'hysterical.For', 'most', 'part', 'review', 'spiritual/metaphysical/philosophical', 'books', 'movies', 'love', 'films', 'even', 'may', 'appear', 'have', 'redeemable', 'aspects', 'Which', 'not', 'true', 'can', 'find', 'meaning', 'depth', 'everything', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'waterboy', 'major', 'philosophical', 'triumph', 'have', 'meaning', 'depth', 'even', 'primarily', 'silly', 'highly', 'bizarre', 'also', 'good', 'love', 'movie', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'DVD', 'do', 'watch', 'time', 'television', 'generate', 'hardy', 'laughs', 'appreciate', 'just', 'Peace', 'Blessings']",N/A

Sad he choosed to be more serious after BIG DADDY before coming back to really boring spoof movies.This time, Sandler, who writes his own jokes (Maybe a little too often for the good of his latest movies.) plays Bobby Boucher, a misunderstood 30 years old boy who's got no one but his mother to keep him company. That until the day he finds a job (For free) as the waterboy for a cheap college football team. The team is tired of losing and their coach Kline (Henry Winkler) will soon discover that they should not mess with Boucher anymore and no one should. He'll be tranformed into a raging tackling machine, using all the past mockeries directed at him as a tackling fuel. And what happens once a little stuttering nobody becomes a VI Football player in college? Girls tend to stick to him like a bunch of flies on a bunch of... Well you know. And the girl he meets, Vicky Vallencourt is an old friend of his but his mom already warned Bobby not to hang out with them ladies cuz to her everything is ""The Devil"".Well put Adam Sandler as a stuttering ignorant between his mamma (Katy Bates, remember MISERY and DOLORES CLAIBORNE?) and a really determined young criminal, just out from prison who wants to have some good time with mamma's boy (FAIRUZA BALK as Vicky Vallencourt. BALK: THE CRAFT, AMERICAN HISTORY X.) And you pretty much get the whole joke. 2 of the scariest chicks of Hollywood during the ninethies to tame a clown used to date cute and nice little blondes in previous movies. No wonder why he stutters and has to wait til he gets on the field to excorcise himself.But truly, i kind of got into Sandler's play even more that time, noticing that he could write something a little different, still on the edge of sanity. And personify a really funny Bobby Boucher! Some kind of an actor showed up after all. If only for that one time. Jokes run from one end of the field to the other and will surely catch a couple everytime. A cool little flick for an evening or 2 of fun. At that point, i can probably quote the whole movie. And not only the guys or the lines that were intended to be the funniest.Other than that? BUT MEN ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE STINKY FEET.

It's probably not his best movie, but it definitely has its moments, with a good number of quotable lines.Henry Winkler is hilarious as the cowardly Coach Klein.  I mean, the scene where he's watching video of a past game, gets an idea for a new play and nearly passes out is probably one of the funniest moments in the movie. His Roy Orbison tattoo speech and his ""Gatorade is better than water"" taunt are also standout scenes.Sandler delivers another great ""idiot comedy"" performance as Bobby Boucher.
