863024,A1KYHC3ZXAJICU,B00068NVI4,,"[4, 4]","On Saturday May 15th 2004, Yes played the first of two shows at the Tsongas Arena which was taped by PBS' Soundstage. Since people have brought up sound quality as an issue, let's get that out of the way. Soundstage is PBS show in which most artists are brought into a studio environment (sound stage) with a very small amount of gear and play before a few hundred people (it's sort of like Unplugged but with electric instruments). The Yes Acoustic dvd is the perfect example of this as it was recorded on a sound stage in L.A.. This concert was NOT recorded on a sound stage but in a real concert hall in front of 8,000 people with the Soundstage crew trying to get what the band sounded like in the arena that night. This is not recorded straight from onstage mics, a mixing board or a multi track recording which allows for fixing it in the mix later on. The sound on here is not bad by any means but there are a couple of spots where there's a bit of echo and the like. This is a high definition recording of what Yes sounded like in the arena on this night.The show opens with a recording of Firebird Suite while the band assemble on the stage. Going For The One opens the show and this is the only part of the dvd where the sound is below par as the Yes crew try to get the sound dialed in. The second song is Sweet Dreams and it is played perfectly and the sound is clearly dialed in from the get go. I've Seen All Good People is well performed although Steve's guitar at the beginning could be a little louder but isn't that usually always the case. People are divided on Mind Drive but I love it and here it's first two parts drop us into a rocking South Side Of The Sky. Turn Of The Century is a wonderful performance. The cool My Eyes section of Footprints leads us into the final part of Mind Drive. The first set is wrapped up with a nice version of Yours Is No Disgrace. There's also a nice interview with Roger Dean in here too.The second half of the show opens with a Rick Wakeman solo, The Meeting Room, with Jon then coming out to join him on The Meeting. Then, the the rest of the band appears for a short stunning acoustic set featuring Long Distance Runaround, Wonderous Stories, Time Is Time, Roundabout, Show Me and Owner Of A Lonely Heart. I also like the fact that there's a bit of talking between the band members and to the audience during this short part of the show. Everyone seems in very good spirits. The second electric half resumes with Rhythm Of Love and the mix is a little harsh here but improves for the remainder of the show. And You And I is flawless while Ritual is a wonderful massive treat! For the enocores, we get a wonderful version of the rare Every Little Thing She Does dating all the way back to the band's beginning. Starship Trooper is a cool way to end the show.",5,"Saturday May 15, 2004 Tsongas Arena, Lowell, MA",1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,2816,"['Saturday', 'May', '15th', '2004', 'Yes', 'played', 'first', 'two', 'shows', 'Tsongas', 'Arena', 'was', 'taped', 'PBS', 'Soundstage', 'people', 'have', 'brought', 'up', 'sound', 'quality', 'issue', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'Soundstage', 'PBS', 'show', 'most', 'artists', 'are', 'brought', 'studio', 'environment', 'sound', 'stage', 'very', 'small', 'amount', 'gear', 'play', 'few', 'hundred', 'people', 'sort', 'Unplugged', 'electric', 'instruments', 'Yes', 'Acoustic', 'dvd', 'perfect', 'example', 'was', 'recorded', 'sound', 'stage', 'L.A..', 'concert', 'was', 'NOT', 'recorded', 'sound', 'stage', 'real', 'concert', 'hall', 'front', '8,000', 'people', 'Soundstage', 'crew', 'trying', 'get', 'what', 'band', 'sounded', 'arena', 'night', 'not', 'recorded', 'straight', 'onstage', 'mics', 'mixing', 'board', 'multi', 'track', 'recording', 'fixing', 'mix', 'later', 'sound', 'here', 'not', 'bad', 'means', 'are', 'couple', 'spots', 'where', 'bit', 'echo', 'like', 'high', 'definition', 'recording', 'what', 'Yes', 'sounded', 'arena', 'night.The', 'show', 'recording', 'Firebird', 'Suite', 'band', 'assemble', 'stage', 'Going', 'One', 'show', 'only', 'part', 'dvd', 'where', 'sound', 'below', 'par', 'Yes', 'crew', 'try', 'get', 'sound', 'dialed', 'second', 'song', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'played', 'perfectly', 'sound', 'clearly', 'dialed', 'get', 'go', ""'ve"", 'Seen', 'All', 'Good', 'People', 'well', 'performed', 'Steve', 'guitar', 'beginning', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'louder', ""n't"", 'usually', 'always', 'case', 'People', 'are', 'divided', 'Mind', 'Drive', 'love', 'here', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'drop', 'rocking', 'South', 'Side', 'Sky', 'Turn', 'Century', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'cool', 'My', 'Eyes', 'section', 'Footprints', 'final', 'part', 'Mind', 'Drive', 'first', 'set', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nice', 'version', 'Yours', 'Disgrace', 'also', 'nice', 'interview', 'Roger', 'Dean', 'here', 'too.The', 'second', 'half', 'show', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'solo', 'Meeting', 'Room', 'Jon', 'then', 'coming', 'out', 'join', 'Meeting', 'Then', 'rest', 'band', 'short', 'stunning', 'acoustic', 'set', 'featuring', 'Long', 'Distance', 'Runaround', 'Wonderous', 'Stories', 'Time', 'Is', 'Time', 'Roundabout', 'Show', 'Me', 'Owner', 'A', 'Lonely', 'Heart', 'also', 'fact', 'bit', 'talking', 'band', 'members', 'audience', 'short', 'part', 'show', 'Everyone', 'very', 'good', 'spirits', 'second', 'electric', 'half', 'resumes', 'Rhythm', 'Love', 'mix', 'little', 'harsh', 'here', 'remainder', 'show', 'flawless', 'Ritual', 'wonderful', 'massive', 'treat', 'enocores', 'get', 'wonderful', 'version', 'rare', 'Every', 'Little', 'Thing', 'dating', 'way', 'back', 'band', 'beginning', 'Starship', 'Trooper', 'cool', 'way', 'end', 'show']",N/A

You should consider a couple points before you buy this video.  First, are you expecting Yes in their prime?  I was, which resulted in me being a little disappointed.  Not to discount their performance; Yes will always be a good band regardless of whether or not they play their 'hits', but I would have preferred more of their more popular songs.  Second, what is it worth to you, to see Rick Wakeman on the keyboards.  Other than the fact that his facial expressions seemed to indicate he wanted to be somewhere else, he's still at the top of his game when it comes to the keyboards.  To watch someone, who's worked so hard, to be so good; that alone made the video worth it to me.  His performance takes nothing away from the band.  The vocals and guitar work were top notch too.  Individually, each member of the band works harder than most other band members.  Collectively, they could sing or play anything and I'd listen to it.  They earn their money.

Although this is worth collecting because of Rick Wakeman's involvement, I have to say many of the performances were a bit weak.  This is probably the case since it was recorded during later part of the tour.  I don't wish to be picky here, only that I hold Yes up to their musical performance heritage.  All of them even looked extreemly tired and probably led to the year of in 2005.  I am still giving it a 5 star at any regards because I still support their efforts.  They may not have the $$ to put on a stage presentation as was in the past, but it is good to know they still perform.

YES was known as the band that traveled with so much lighting and sound gear that they had convoys.  They could do no wrong in my eyes.When I saw this DVD, which I purchased based on the ratings, asmany other Yes disks were not rated well. (Like Live in Phili).Makes me wonder if the band has any say in what is released?I was stunned. I saw Steve Howe, and could not believe howI thought to myself, this may be the last time I see the guy.Some of his acoustic work on older songs is aweful. But he is much older than in 1979 right??  No surprise, we all are.  After watching much of the disk, and coming to ""Roundabout"", I almostfell off my chair as I watched them play at about 1/3 tempo.Extensive drums during most of the show consits of a ""Hi-hat, a Base drum, a rider cymbal, and a snare drum, that is it. Being a drummer for 18 years, I know this music cold, and I till this day play most yes with music in front of me. Especially songs like ""Roundabout"".  They sit through much of the concert. I honestly thought Howe should be in a wheel Chair. He looks weak and tired.I prefer to remember them for the great band they were in the 70's, and not remember them as ""beyond AARP age"".  It is upsetting, but I suppose now at 44 myself, we are all getting older.  I even took notice of all the shots when he walked through the audience, most of the ""Guys"" at the show had ""male pattern baldness"".  Unlike the Stones, or Zep, or Who, Black Sabbath/Oz, who also have young followers, Yes does not appear to have nearly as many followers in the younger Gen X and Gen Y.As a drummer I have so much respect for this band.  Yes was the inventors of ""Rock/Jazz Fusion"", or ""Rock/Progressive Jazz"".  I could play nearly any other band's music from memory after some practice. Not the case with all Yes songs often.  If I sit down and play ""Roundabout"", or even ""And you and I"", ""Close to the edge"" (Not on this DVD), I need the drum music, and I am a good drummer.Maybe because of the fact that I put YES on the top of my list,higher than all the other bands I mentioned, I feel this way aboutthis DVD, and honestly it depressed me.",2,"I love Yes, maybe I just remember them when I was 17 in 79'",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2204,"['love', 'yes', 'wore', 'out', 'three', 'Yes', 'Fragile', 'albums', '2', 'Close', 'Edge', 'YES', 'was', 'known', 'band', 'traveled', 'so', 'much', 'lighting', 'sound', 'gear', 'had', 'convoys', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'eyes.When', 'saw', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'based', 'ratings', 'other', 'Yes', 'disks', 'were', 'not', 'rated', 'well', 'Live', 'Phili', 'wonder', 'band', 'say', 'what', 'released', 'was', 'stunned', 'saw', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'howI', 'thought', 'myself', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'see', 'guy.Some', 'acoustic', 'work', 'older', 'songs', 'aweful', 'much', 'older', '1979', 'right', 'surprise', 'are', 'watching', 'much', 'disk', 'coming', 'Roundabout', 'almostfell', 'chair', 'watched', 'play', 'about', '1/3', 'tempo.Extensive', 'drums', 'most', 'show', 'Hi-hat', 'Base', 'drum', 'rider', 'cymbal', 'snare', 'drum', 'Being', 'drummer', '18', 'years', 'know', 'music', 'cold', 'till', 'day', 'play', 'most', 'yes', 'music', 'front', 'Especially', 'songs', 'Roundabout', 'sit', 'much', 'concert', 'honestly', 'thought', 'Howe', 'should', 'be', 'wheel', 'Chair', 'weak', 'tired.I', 'prefer', 'remember', 'great', 'band', 'were', '70', 'not', 'remember', 'AARP', 'age', 'upsetting', 'suppose', 'now', '44', 'are', 'getting', 'older', 'even', 'took', 'notice', 'shots', 'when', 'walked', 'audience', 'most', 'Guys', 'show', 'had', 'male', 'pattern', 'baldness', 'Stones', 'Zep', 'Who', 'Black', 'Sabbath/Oz', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'young', 'followers', 'Yes', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'followers', 'younger', 'Gen', 'X', 'Gen', 'Y.As', 'drummer', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'respect', 'band', 'Yes', 'was', 'inventors', 'Rock/Jazz', 'Fusion', 'Rock/Progressive', 'Jazz', 'could', 'play', 'nearly', 'other', 'band', 'music', 'memory', 'practice', 'Not', 'case', 'Yes', 'songs', 'often', 'sit', 'down', 'play', 'Roundabout', 'even', 'Close', 'edge', 'Not', 'DVD', 'need', 'drum', 'music', 'am', 'good', 'drummer.Maybe', 'fact', 'put', 'YES', 'top', 'list', 'higher', 'other', 'bands', 'mentioned', 'feel', 'way', 'DVD', 'honestly', 'depressed']",N/A

863033,AEFGR6NFTNWH0,B00068NVI4,Emile Pinsonneault,"[4, 8]","Like most Yes fans, I waited for the release of this DVD and was somewhat annoyed when it was delayed. I think many of the reviewers have captured both the negative and positive aspects of this release, the primary one being the audio. I have seen Yes live at least ten times since 1972 and of course was present at the 35th anniversary tour when it landed at the Office Depot Center in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. That was the performance that probably should have been filmed because it was extraordinary. But as far as a live sound, most of the people I talked to agreed that it should have been much louder. I don't know if this correlates wuth the mix on this DVD, but I agree with the other reviewers that the drum mix is too low and the vocal mix too high. Compare it to ""Yes Symphonic Live"" and ""House of Yes"" and you'll see what I'm talking about. And Howe was having an off night compared to the other live DVD's and concerts I've seen. Still, I loved the concert and this disk definately contains some gems that most Yes fans will find hard to resist. The acoustic set is worth the price of admission and there are some other excellent performances. Wakeman is superb and he truly shines on this DVD.

863034,A3IONOAE8EKJH1,B00068NVI4,"Eric Cartman ""LYJY""","[2, 2]","I'm very surprised that some of the reviewers don't like this DVD.  The performances are absolutely amazing.  Some reviewers have stated that Anderson is in the spotlight the whole time and the band members aren't given any time to show off their capabilities.  I don't see that at all except maybe on the beginning of Rhythm of Love when Anderson goes into the audience.  Okay, that's part of one song.  And maybe the acoustic set turned out to be a disappointment for some but I don't see it as a disappointment at all.  I think this DVD is absolutely spectacular.  The performances of South Side Of The Sky, Starship Trooper, Yours Is No Disgrace, You're Move/I've Seen All Good People, Ritual, And You And I, Turn Of The Century, Sweet Dreams, Mind Drive, and even their version of Every Little Thing are all amazing.  Even the acoustic set is incredible.  It shows how brilliant a band really is if they could successfully play some of their songs acoustically.  They do a fantastic job with Long Distance Runaroud, Wonderous Stories, The Meeting, Owner Of A Lonely Heart, Time Is Time, Show Me, and Steve Howe's performance of Second Initial.  Even Roundabout works quite well acoustically.  The camera work is also very good and you get plently of shots of the band members.  Howe (my favorite member) is such an incredible guitarist and you get to see how brilliant he is on electric, acoustic, lap steel, and that other guitar that he uses on Your Move and Wonderous Stories.  You also get to see and hear how Wakeman is a keyboard wizard and is one of the best keyboardists ever.  He does a great job on his regular keyboards during the regular parts of the set and is also brilliant on the piano during the acoustic set.  One great thing about this DVD that is a problem with Yes Live at Montreaux (which is still fantastic) is that you get to see a lot more of Squire.  Not only is Squire a fantastic bassist and backing singer, but he is also the only founding member of Yes who has never left the band.  You get to see and hear how great of a bass player Squire is and how important his backing vocals are.  Some Yes fans seem to prefer Bruford on drums over White, but White is just as good as Bruford ever was.  Plus, it shows that White has been in the band a lot longer than Bruford was so it obviously has worked better with White.  Remember, White was once played drums for John Lennon, and there is no way that Lennon would have allowed White to drum for him if he wasn't any good.  White is an amazing drummer and his drums on South of the Sky alone justify his importance to the band.  Anderson has an amazing voice and it's fantastic that he still can sing as high as he can.  As a band, their playing is just as good, if not better, as it was years ago and you definitely get to witness the virtuosic musicianship of all the band members (especially Howe, Squire, and Wakeman).  This is a fantastic DVD and I strongly recommend it.",5,"Yes, It's An Incredible DVD",1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,2956,"[""'m"", 'very', 'surprised', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', 'performances', 'are', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'Anderson', 'spotlight', 'whole', 'time', 'band', 'members', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'time', 'show', 'off', 'capabilities', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'maybe', 'beginning', 'Rhythm', 'Love', 'when', 'Anderson', 'audience', 'Okay', 'part', 'one', 'song', 'maybe', 'acoustic', 'set', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'disappointment', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'disappointment', 'think', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'South', 'Side', 'Sky', 'Starship', 'Trooper', 'Yours', 'Disgrace', ""'re"", 'Move/I', ""'ve"", 'Seen', 'All', 'Good', 'People', 'Ritual', 'Turn', 'Century', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'Mind', 'Drive', 'even', 'version', 'Every', 'Little', 'Thing', 'are', 'amazing', 'Even', 'acoustic', 'set', 'incredible', 'how', 'brilliant', 'band', 'really', 'could', 'successfully', 'play', 'songs', 'acoustically', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Long', 'Distance', 'Runaroud', 'Wonderous', 'Stories', 'Meeting', 'Owner', 'A', 'Lonely', 'Heart', 'Time', 'Is', 'Time', 'Show', 'Me', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'performance', 'Second', 'Initial', 'Even', 'Roundabout', 'quite', 'well', 'acoustically', 'camera', 'work', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'get', 'plently', 'shots', 'band', 'members', 'Howe', 'favorite', 'member', 'such', 'incredible', 'guitarist', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'brilliant', 'electric', 'acoustic', 'lap', 'steel', 'other', 'guitar', 'Move', 'Wonderous', 'Stories', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'how', 'Wakeman', 'keyboard', 'wizard', 'one', 'best', 'keyboardists', 'ever', 'great', 'job', 'regular', 'keyboards', 'regular', 'parts', 'set', 'also', 'brilliant', 'piano', 'acoustic', 'set', 'One', 'great', 'thing', 'DVD', 'problem', 'Yes', 'Live', 'Montreaux', 'still', 'fantastic', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'Squire', 'Not', 'only', 'Squire', 'fantastic', 'bassist', 'backing', 'singer', 'also', 'only', 'founding', 'member', 'Yes', 'who', 'never', 'left', 'band', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'how', 'great', 'bass', 'player', 'Squire', 'how', 'important', 'backing', 'vocals', 'are', 'Yes', 'fans', 'seem', 'prefer', 'Bruford', 'drums', 'White', 'White', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Bruford', 'ever', 'was', 'White', 'been', 'band', 'lot', 'longer', 'Bruford', 'was', 'so', 'obviously', 'worked', 'better', 'White', 'Remember', 'White', 'was', 'once', 'played', 'drums', 'John', 'Lennon', 'way', 'Lennon', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'White', 'drum', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'White', 'amazing', 'drummer', 'drums', 'South', 'Sky', 'alone', 'justify', 'importance', 'band', 'Anderson', 'amazing', 'voice', 'fantastic', 'still', 'can', 'sing', 'as', 'high', 'can', 'band', 'playing', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'was', 'years', 'ago', 'definitely', 'get', 'witness', 'virtuosic', 'musicianship', 'band', 'members', 'especially', 'Howe', 'Squire', 'Wakeman', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'strongly', 'recommend']",N/A

Bertels,"[7, 8]","This DVD is an extraordinary masterpiece, exemplary of the Yes phenomenon that has captured the progressive rock world for the last 37 years. The classic lineup of Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White returns in this live performance recorded in Boston, MA in 2004.Performing on a stage designed by Roger Dean (who has also created much of the artwork on Yes album covers), Yes traverses from classic stage setup to a special ""unplugged"" set, back to the original. This versatility and prowess demonstrates why Yes is one of the few bands that doesn't need ""bells and whistles"" onstage and instead, relies on the sheer virtuosity of their craft. The band's odd time-signatures, flowing bass lines and lightning-fast guitar riffs are accompanied by Rick Wakeman's legendary performance on keyboards; Wakeman is no less than mesmerizing. Together, they are anchored by Alan White, who provides a solid and flawless backing on drums/percussion.While the band members may have aged chronologically, they are still as tight-knit a group musically as they were when they originally created this music. One can simply close one's eyes while watching this and not be able to tell the difference between the music emanating from the DVD and the Yes of ""yesterday"". Jon Anderson's vocal performance is stellar and he is one of the few lead vocalists that has not lost his ability to reach the higher end of the spectrum. Of noteworthy mention is the backing vocal section of Chris Squire and Steve Howe; it is this unique harmonic unity that has kept Yes at a rare forefront for the past 37 years.Overall, the video and sound quality are excellent. I recommend watching this in 5.1, as the ""live"" performance will be definitely be more robust.This is both for old and new Yes fans, as well as those interested in seeing ""live"" superior musicianship, firsthand.**Update: 2/21/2007 -- I think it's a disservice to Yes, Amazon and prospective buyers of this product for reviewers to watch this DVD objectively, and expect to see Yes appearing unchanged from 1979, as several have. As a prime example of this, it's unfair to take shots at Alan White and say that his playing is not what it used to be, 25 years ago. I saw his drumming in this as well as ""House of Yes -- Live at the House of Blues (1999)"" and frankly, I thought his playing was excellent in both. Likewise, for Steve Howe, Jon Anderson and Chris Squire.The band members of Yes and older bands are human beings as well as artists; they are not superhuman and they age just like the rest of us. Musical performance should be judged in proportion to this DVD; not how others wish to perceive them. They are very remarkable musicians and I saw absolutely nothing wrong with their abilities.",5,Magnificent....Colossal.....Stupendous!!!!,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,2770,"['DVD', 'extraordinary', 'masterpiece', 'exemplary', 'Yes', 'phenomenon', 'captured', 'progressive', 'rock', 'world', 'last', '37', 'years', 'classic', 'lineup', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'Alan', 'White', 'returns', 'live', 'performance', 'recorded', 'Boston', 'MA', '2004.Performing', 'stage', 'designed', 'Roger', 'Dean', 'who', 'also', 'created', 'much', 'artwork', 'Yes', 'album', 'covers', 'Yes', 'traverses', 'classic', 'stage', 'setup', 'special', 'unplugged', 'set', 'back', 'original', 'versatility', 'prowess', 'demonstrates', 'why', 'Yes', 'one', 'few', 'bands', ""n't"", 'need', 'bells', 'whistles', 'onstage', 'instead', 'relies', 'sheer', 'virtuosity', 'craft', 'band', 'odd', 'time-signatures', 'flowing', 'bass', 'lines', 'lightning-fast', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'are', 'accompanied', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'legendary', 'performance', 'keyboards', 'Wakeman', 'less', 'mesmerizing', 'Together', 'are', 'anchored', 'Alan', 'White', 'who', 'solid', 'flawless', 'backing', 'band', 'members', 'may', 'have', 'aged', 'chronologically', 'are', 'still', 'tight-knit', 'group', 'musically', 'were', 'when', 'originally', 'created', 'music', 'One', 'can', 'simply', 'close', 'one', 'eyes', 'watching', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'difference', 'music', 'emanating', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'yesterday', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'vocal', 'performance', 'stellar', 'one', 'few', 'lead', 'vocalists', 'not', 'lost', 'ability', 'reach', 'higher', 'end', 'spectrum', 'noteworthy', 'mention', 'backing', 'vocal', 'section', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'unique', 'harmonic', 'unity', 'kept', 'Yes', 'rare', 'forefront', 'past', '37', 'years.Overall', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'recommend', 'watching', '5.1', 'live', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'definitely', 'be', 'more', 'robust.This', 'old', 'new', 'Yes', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'interested', 'seeing', 'live', 'superior', 'musicianship', 'firsthand', '**Update', '2/21/2007', 'think', 'disservice', 'Yes', 'Amazon', 'prospective', 'buyers', 'product', 'reviewers', 'watch', 'DVD', 'objectively', 'expect', 'see', 'Yes', 'appearing', 'unchanged', '1979', 'several', 'have', 'prime', 'example', 'unfair', 'take', 'shots', 'Alan', 'White', 'say', 'playing', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'saw', 'drumming', 'as', 'well', 'House', 'Yes', 'Live', 'House', 'Blues', '1999', 'frankly', 'thought', 'playing', 'was', 'excellent', 'Likewise', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'Chris', 'Squire.The', 'band', 'members', 'Yes', 'older', 'bands', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'as', 'well', 'artists', 'are', 'not', 'superhuman', 'age', 'just', 'rest', 'Musical', 'performance', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'proportion', 'DVD', 'not', 'how', 'others', 'wish', 'perceive', 'are', 'very', 'remarkable', 'musicians', 'saw', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'abilities']",N/A

Every time I bought a DVD, I knew I would have to sit through ""And you and I"" and ""I've seen good people"" again. I love these songs believe me. But on every DVD, there would be only two or three new classical songs. Now they seem to be understanding that they have to go back to those songs which made Yes one of the best Rock groups ever. We've been throght the 80's and the 90's and when we look back we see nothing of great impact has been done in terms of Rock. We had ""The Police"", Maybe ""U2"", but good, intelligent, pop and creative music mixed up with quality and great musicians has not been found. Of course, we had King Crimson. The reason why I did not mention this other great band was just because I find Yes more popular. Maybe I'm wrong. But the thing is that Yes looked back and probably they had it figured out , ""My God! The songs we composed in the past were one of the best things made in terms of rock music ever."" Let's go back to it and sell, make money, have fun..."" And I would say they are right. I admit and hope millions of Yes fans agree with me : They still have some old rarities left : Sound Chaser, To be Over (Steve Howe; instrumental); Dear Faher; Don't Kill the Whale; Parallells and maybe some more. Every time I saw a Yes DVD I wondered, ""Where's ""South Side of the Sky"" ? It was released in ""Acoustic"" and it is relealed again now. Thank God. I just hope that they do not keep releasing the same songs over and over. I agree that some songs are worth listening to a new version.I'm a little tired of seeing good people, but what Yes did now I take my hats off. Congratulations.

What keeps it from getting five stars has more to do with the setlist selection than the actual performance.  Basically, the inclusion of ""Mind Drive"" slows down the entire show ... and considering it it played in the first half of the show, its inclusion kinda makes it feel like this show never really gets started.  After ""Mind Drive"" (which inexplicably is divided in different sections rather than played once through) is over, the show gets MUCH better.This DVD captures excellent performances of ""Ritual,"" ""Turn of the Century,"" and ""Starship Trooper.""  And although ""Mind Drive"" was a bad choice, the inclusion of rarely played songs such as ""Sweet Dreams,"" ""Going for the One,"" ""The Meeting,"" ""Time is Time,"" and ""Every Little Thing"" is a real treat.  Anderson seems to be having a blast towards the end of the show.  The acoustic section in the middle is also enjoyable.There are no extra features of note here, but the concert itself is very well-filmed.

It's one of Yes' two best DVDs, second only to the magnificent ""Symphonic Live.""First, the awesome, moving Roger Dean stage set makes this a true visual experience. The set, which is sort of an undersea garden/mystical landscapes hybrid, fills the imagination. Dean, if you recall, did the artwork for many classic Yes albums, and looking at this stage is like watching a Dean painting come to life.The set list is absolutely, positively spectacular. Yes was much-maligned in recent years for their stagnant, predictable set list, but on their 2004 tour they aired music that never been played live in their 35-year history, most notably the stellar mid-90s epic ""Mind Drive."" Other songs - ranging from ""Going for the One"" to ""Sweet Dreams"" - hadn't been visited since the 70s, and obligatory pieces like ""Roundabout"" were given fresh arrangements. And there were the 20-minute epics - in addition to ""Mind Drive,"" the show features an excellent version of ""Ritual.""The musician line-up is stellar. While the Yes line-up seems to change as frequently as the weather, on this night it was the classic line up of Anderson/Howe/Squire/Wakeman/White.

The music selection on this tour was outstanding, the sound was outstanding and the lads seemed to really enjoy themselves.  One could hope that they'll continue to do so, but one never knows, do they?The only things I'd have like to had done better is to have the camera operators know who was going to play what at what time.  They sometimes had the camera on one bandmember while another was really jamming on his instrument.  There were some times when I'd have liked to see Rick Wakeman's fingers flying across the keyboards during one of his spotlights rather than watching another bandmember keeping the beat.  Get in there close and tight and see Howe or Squire bending the strings.  That's the only thing I'd say that's keeping me from giving this a five.  And it doesn't miss by a whole star.If you like Yes, go out and get this DVD.  Don't cry about ""I think they should have played this song or left out that song.""  They've been playing for 35 years and unless they're going to play for a couple of days solid, someone's going to be disappointed.

Kepler,"[2, 2]","I love this this music and the people who play it more than I know how to say, so I feel I owe them, and all longtime fans, full honesty in my review.A magical set with gorgeous lighting, great technical production, some preciously seldom-performed songs, and a charming acoustic set, are the highlights of this DVD set.  In particular, the acoustic blues treatment of Roundabout was a stroke of genius, almost self-deprecating in a gentle sort of way, reminding me of The Who's My Generation Blues from The Kids are Alright.I found myself brought to tears of nostalgia at moments, although there was a little sadness behind those tears as well, as each time out Yes performances, and Jon's voice, get a little more raggedy and inconsistent. The only player consistently in top form in these latter years is Alan White, as lately even Steve and Rick have to drop notes to keep up the pace.To be completely honest, I haven't heard a live Yes show that is brilliant and vital from end to end since the ABWH and Union tours of 1989-1992.I feel many of the positive reviews of recent Yes DVDs to be written by fans so glad the band is still playing, they are not frank about the rough edges and sometimes lackluster performances.  There is nothing wrong with finding these less-than-best performances enjoyable and worth buying. I do not regret my own purchase, but in the future will take some of these effusive reviews with more than a few grains of salt.I, too, am glad the band is still playing from time to time, and in particular find parts of the earlier Symphonic Live DVD to be performances as essential as anything they have ever done before.So, with some trepidation, I will lend some trust one more time to the enthusiasm of my fellow fans and go ahead and order the 2003 Montreux show, hoping that it captured one of those good nights, or at least has enough post-production cheats to cover the blemishes and fill the gaps.",4,"Visually beautiful, well produced sonically, uneven performances",1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,1932,"['love', 'music', 'people', 'who', 'play', 'more', 'know', 'how', 'say', 'feel', 'owe', 'longtime', 'fans', 'full', 'honesty', 'review.A', 'magical', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'lighting', 'great', 'technical', 'production', 'preciously', 'seldom-performed', 'songs', 'charming', 'acoustic', 'set', 'are', 'highlights', 'DVD', 'set', 'particular', 'acoustic', 'blues', 'treatment', 'Roundabout', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'almost', 'self-deprecating', 'gentle', 'sort', 'way', 'reminding', 'Who', 'My', 'Generation', 'Blues', 'Kids', 'are', 'Alright.I', 'found', 'brought', 'tears', 'nostalgia', 'moments', 'was', 'little', 'sadness', 'tears', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'out', 'Yes', 'performances', 'Jon', 'voice', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'raggedy', 'inconsistent', 'only', 'player', 'consistently', 'top', 'form', 'latter', 'years', 'Alan', 'White', 'lately', 'even', 'Steve', 'Rick', 'have', 'drop', 'notes', 'keep', 'up', 'pace.To', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'live', 'Yes', 'show', 'brilliant', 'vital', 'end', 'end', 'ABWH', 'Union', 'tours', '1989-1992.I', 'feel', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'recent', 'Yes', 'DVDs', 'be', 'written', 'fans', 'so', 'glad', 'band', 'still', 'playing', 'are', 'not', 'frank', 'rough', 'edges', 'sometimes', 'lackluster', 'performances', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'finding', 'less-than-best', 'performances', 'enjoyable', 'worth', 'buying', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'own', 'purchase', 'future', 'will', 'take', 'effusive', 'reviews', 'more', 'few', 'grains', 'salt.I', 'too', 'am', 'band', 'still', 'playing', 'time', 'time', 'particular', 'find', 'parts', 'earlier', 'Symphonic', 'Live', 'DVD', 'be', 'performances', 'as', 'essential', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'before.So', 'trepidation', 'will', 'lend', 'trust', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'enthusiasm', 'fellow', 'fans', 'go', 'ahead', 'order', '2003', 'Montreux', 'show', 'hoping', 'captured', 'one', 'good', 'nights', 'least', 'enough', 'post-production', 'cheats', 'cover', 'blemishes', 'fill', 'gaps']",N/A

This video is well staged and well shot, and the band plays and sings exceptionally well, even if Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman appear to be bored (appearance only; their playing certainly is sharp). Unfortunately, the whole thing is let down by some of the worst sound I've ever heard in a live performance. The whole thing is mud--compressed, confused, and cloudy. Individual parts occasionally stick out from the murk, but only just. An example: Alan White, in addition to his drumset, is surrounded by giant bulbous drums that appear to be designed by Roger Dean, used only in the intro to Sweet Dreams. At that point there is no one else playing, just White, and all of those big drums are being played by remote beaters. Presumably it sounded impressive in person, but here there is no hint of any sound coming from those drums. It's a completely mystery how the sound mixer could screw that up--there was no other instrument to balance it against! This music is complex, with lots of interlocking parts, and each of the players is usually playing something unusual, so it's all the more important that the sound be clear and clean, and all the more disappointing to find it so muddy.

I've been waiting for the DVD, but only as a momento of the tour since I was extremely disappointed in the Symphonic Yes DVD (I make myself watch it now and then, but it just doesn't cut it- very lackluster performance). My expectations for this DVD were quite low (hopeful- but I was ready to be disappointed again). Well I was quite pleasantly surprised! This DVD is WAY better than Symphonic Yes! The stage presentation, the playing- so much better! I love this DVD!  I think my wife is sick of me playing it over and over. I agree that the sound is at times not perfect and that Jon's voice does overshadow the instruments at times- but this is live music- it isn't perfect. But it is definitely very enjoyable.  I won't go track by track- but the song selection is great. The ONLY disappointing thing about this DVD is that my all-time favorite Yes song- Awaken- was played at the show I saw (oh yes!

They gave a tremendously committed effort to these songs and I loved every minute of the film. I don't quite get the complaints about the sound. I have a very good DVD 5.1 system and I found the sound well balanced, with an empahsis on the music making more than the concert experience. Ambient audience noise is muffled. Good. This ain't Springsteen.From the signature Stravinsky quote through STARSHIP TROOPER, the intensity, humour and passion about this material comes across terrifically, and Steve Howe is an absolute wonder, even if he looks older than God Almighty. Knuckleheads 1/5 his age should play 1/5 as well. And Howe is very much the unsung hero of the history of YES. He plays the works of Peter Banks and Trevor Rabin with the same commitment as though he had been the composer. All of YES's most memorable moments have come courtesy of Howe's fleet command of the classics, jazz and rock and his incredible commitment to his instrument. There has never been a guiatrist quite like him. How could there be? Who else could make musical sense out of the naff lyrics of Jon Anderson?Chris Squier is still looking for a sartorial genie. Hopelessly out of whack with any sense of fashion, he nevertheless commands his bass with authority and still has the choir boy vocal chops to fill out Anderson's still soaring vocals. Yes the key is lower than it used to be, but Anderson still soars where non-eunuchs fear to tread. White seems to be the picture of health and Wakeman looks like he's determined to make rehab work this time. In any case they cover the entire career, and along with the just published triple CD of concert takes, THE WORD IS LIVE, YES delivers a comprehensive review of an astoundingly creative 35 years. it will be interesting to see where they pick up after the brilliant ILLUMINATION CD/DVD of a couple years back. That CD seemed to point to a whole new direction, and given the positively energetic and brilliant SPECTRUM  released by Steve Howe this year, hopefully 2006 will see a new YES release.

I have never seen them live before and, to be truthful, I didn't know what to expect. How many bands that have been around for 35+ years and still sound good without a second band backing them up? What? the Stones! Dream on. Everybody sounded wonderfull. Jon Anderson tenor voice was so nice to hear. He is also a very good frontman who knows how to talk to the audience and a very good back up musican. It was great to see Steve Howe, one of my favorite guitar players. He can still play. I was funny to see his slide guitar roll away from him. We all need a little Spinal Tap in our life. Mr.'s Squire and White provided a incredible rhythm section. I can't say enough about them. Rick Wakeman played very well. One of the best keyboardist of all time but he had a sour puss on his face most of the night. He did seem to lighten up during the acoustic set.What I like about the show is when they played songs I did not know I wasn't bored one bit. If you like this tour, pick the 35th A' triple CD.

Herbert,"[2, 7]","I managed to see one of the dates on this tour and had a great seat, about 6 rows from the stage in front of Steve Howe, but atrocious sound diminished an otherwise great night.  Much like my experience, this DVD continues the tradition of many Yes releases that simply do not live up to modern standards of sound quality.  Someone from the Yes production team really needs to listen to what's possible - like the sonically amazing Steve Winwood Soundstage release - and do a little more work.  Given the vast number of DVD's that have been released by Yes chronicling their great career, I hope that at least one of them will be sonically up to standard.  Thus far, none are.The video quality however is another story.  Very clean and clear, well edited and paced, this is a very enjoyable viewing experience.Performance-wise, the boys are in fine form this night.  Steve Howe especially seems unable to play a bad note.  There are times however when passion and enthusiasm seem lessened from earlier days.  The first few numbers go along seemingly without real engagement, picking up considerably with ""South Side of the Sky"" and staying at a high level until later in the evening.  The acoustic portion of the evening is a highlight.  Should they tour again, consideration should really be given to a smaller venue outing and an all acoustic performance - it's really that good.  ""Ritual"" allows for what might be the most incomprehensible percussion solo in rock history.  What was Alan thinking with those bizarre outrigger drums?  I've seen drummers do more with a pair of sticks and a high-hat than he did with all his massive set.  Unfortunately, the normally show-stopping finale of ""Starship Troopers"", while well played here, doesn't seem to be as energetic as in the past.But hey, why quibble; this is definitely one of the better (maybe the best) captures of this legendary band.  While the sound isn't up to par with the best, it is better than most of this band's previous DVD efforts.  Most Yes fans will be more than pleased.  I just can't help thinking it could be better still with more attention paid to the audio.",3,"Great Video, So-So Sound",1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,2134,"['managed', 'see', 'one', 'dates', 'tour', 'had', 'great', 'seat', 'about', '6', 'rows', 'stage', 'front', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'atrocious', 'sound', 'diminished', 'otherwise', 'great', 'night', 'Much', 'experience', 'DVD', 'tradition', 'many', 'Yes', 'releases', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'modern', 'standards', 'sound', 'quality', 'Someone', 'Yes', 'production', 'team', 'really', 'listen', 'what', 'possible', 'sonically', 'amazing', 'Steve', 'Winwood', 'Soundstage', 'release', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'work', 'Given', 'vast', 'number', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'Yes', 'chronicling', 'great', 'career', 'hope', 'least', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'sonically', 'up', 'standard', 'Thus', 'far', 'none', 'are.The', 'video', 'quality', 'however', 'story', 'Very', 'clean', 'clear', 'well', 'edited', 'paced', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience.Performance-wise', 'boys', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'night', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'especially', 'unable', 'play', 'bad', 'note', 'are', 'times', 'however', 'when', 'passion', 'enthusiasm', 'seem', 'lessened', 'earlier', 'days', 'first', 'few', 'numbers', 'go', 'along', 'seemingly', 'real', 'engagement', 'picking', 'up', 'considerably', 'South', 'Side', 'Sky', 'staying', 'high', 'level', 'later', 'evening', 'acoustic', 'portion', 'evening', 'highlight', 'Should', 'tour', 'again', 'consideration', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'given', 'smaller', 'venue', 'outing', 'acoustic', 'performance', 'really', 'good', 'Ritual', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'incomprehensible', 'percussion', 'solo', 'rock', 'history', 'What', 'was', 'Alan', 'thinking', 'bizarre', 'outrigger', 'drums', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'drummers', 'do', 'more', 'pair', 'sticks', 'high-hat', 'did', 'massive', 'set', 'Unfortunately', 'normally', 'show-stopping', 'finale', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'well', 'played', 'here', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'energetic', 'past.But', 'hey', 'why', 'quibble', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'maybe', 'best', 'captures', 'legendary', 'band', 'sound', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'best', 'better', 'most', 'band', 'previous', 'DVD', 'efforts', 'Most', 'Yes', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'pleased', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'still', 'more', 'attention', 'paid', 'audio']",N/A

The sound is good, the direction and editing are good, the performances are stellar musically, and the whole thing is put together very well.If you weren't able to see the tour, then you'll especially enjoy this DVD immensely.  This is unlike any other Yes tour.  The first thing that is unique is the inclusion of an acoustic set, which is fun and informal, but includes some impressive music.  Second, this show is a true retrospective of the band's entire career.  We get the standards, of course (""Your is No Disgrace"", ""All Good People"", ""Starship Trooper"", ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"", etc).  But the rest of the show is made up of rarely-played material: two songs from the early albums (""Sweet Dreams"" and a terrific ""Every Little Thing""), an ABWH song (""The Meeting""), finally some inclusion of music from the mid-90s (""Mind Drive"" and the intro from ""Footprints"" dressed up as a short song), two Rabin-era songs (""Rhythm of Love"" plus the obligatory ""Owner""), some newer material (""Time is Time"" from MAGNIFICATION and ""Show Me""), and a few deep cuts like ""Turn of the Century"".  The whole thing kicks off with ""Going for the One"" and culminates  with a searing ""Ritual"".The highlights are an amazing rendition of ""South Side of the Sky"", one of the most emotional performances of ""And You and I"" I've ever heard, the gorgeous ""Wonderous Stories"", possibly the most perfect Yes song ever, and a truly lovely ""Century"".  Other really great moments are Rick's lovely piano intro to the acoustic set, his solos in the Rabin-era songs, Steve's beautiful ""Second Initial"" which closes the acoustic set, and of course Chris' bass solo in ""Ritual"", although it is not as long or as raucous as I've seen it before.I highly recommend this DVD to other Yes fans.  If you enjoyed the band's other DVD releases in recent years, then this one will certainly not disappoint.

863060,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B00068NVI4,Sky,"[31, 33]","One of my fondest Yes memories is watching from the 14th row at Madison Square Garden circa 1977 (it was the Going For the One tour) as the band rocked out. And back then they truly were all about rock...albeit prog rock, but indeed it was about rock. Jon Anderson sang like an angel. Rick Wakeman returned to his rightful place in the band (replacing a fair Patrick Moraz) and hid behind long flowing blonde hair as he literally almost rocked his keyboards off the stage at one point. And Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White pumped out their intricate, precisely played melodies. All woven together to absolutely knock The Garden audience out of their seats. Literally. Everyone stood on their seats throughout the whole show.Flash forward to May 2004 where the boys are together to shoot a DVD during their 35th Anniversary tour. Well, seems that the guys have aged a bit from 1977 to 2004 (almost 30 years!!!), but certainly you'd never know it from listening to the musical performances in Songs from Tsongas. Jon Anderson's vocals sound superb. He hits every note (in the '77 show that I saw he had an unforgettable mis-step in Roundabout); Howe and Squire play their instruments precisely and their back up vocals sound as if you're listening to the studio versions; Wakeman and White are also as precise as the studio versions of their setlist. And that setlist is as follows:Disc 1 (65:17)1. Intro/Firebird suite2. Going for the one3. Sweet dreams4. Your move/I've seen all good people5. Mind drive Part 1 and 26. South side of the sky7. Turn of the century8. My eyes/Mind drive part 39. Yours is no disgraceDisc 2 (85:14)1. The meeting room/The meeting2. Long distance runaround3. Wonderous stories4. Time is time5. Rounabout6. Show me7. Owner of a lonely heart8. Second initial9. Rhythm of love10. And you and I11. Ritual12. Every little thing13. Starship trooperTotal Time: 150:31. Now that's a nice dose! The picture is crystal clear, and you have a choice between Dolby or DTS 5.1; it sounded very, very good. The DVD quality lends a nice effect of being in the front row of the show instead of simply sitting in front of the TV.It took away from the live effect a bit for me, but I skipped around to the pre-1980s stuff first, then I watched the whole show again the next evening. I was really glad that I did that, because there was a lot of material that (I couldn't believe that) I didn't even know from the 1980 forward period. The new and newer stuff is a nice bonus and ""nice to have"", but the pre-1980 stuff is why I bought the disk, it's performed precisely and it's ""need to have"" for Yes fans of that era.Yes fans need to hit the buy button now!P.S. - Warning: For those fans that were teenagers or older in the 70s, this DVD will make you feel your age! The Yes in my mind were the Yes from 1977. Silly, I know. But it was a shock in this DVD for me to see Steve Howe looking like the Cryptkeeper (he still rocked though). And an aged Rick Wakeman literally just stood there behind his keyboards like a zombie completely, emotionlessly still through each song (didn't take away from his awesome renditions).",4,Night of the Living Yes,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,3136,"['One', 'fondest', 'Yes', 'memories', 'watching', '14th', 'row', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'circa', '1977', 'was', 'Going', 'One', 'tour', 'band', 'rocked', 'out', 'back', 'then', 'truly', 'were', 'rock', 'prog', 'rock', 'indeed', 'was', 'rock', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'sang', 'angel', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'returned', 'rightful', 'place', 'band', 'replacing', 'fair', 'Patrick', 'Moraz', 'long', 'flowing', 'blonde', 'hair', 'literally', 'almost', 'rocked', 'keyboards', 'stage', 'one', 'point', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'Alan', 'White', 'pumped', 'out', 'intricate', 'precisely', 'played', 'melodies', 'woven', 'together', 'absolutely', 'knock', 'Garden', 'audience', 'seats', 'Literally', 'Everyone', 'stood', 'seats', 'whole', 'show.Flash', 'forward', 'May', '2004', 'where', 'boys', 'are', 'together', 'shoot', 'DVD', '35th', 'Anniversary', 'tour', 'Well', 'guys', 'have', 'aged', 'bit', '1977', '2004', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'certainly', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'listening', 'musical', 'performances', 'Songs', 'Tsongas', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'vocals', 'sound', 'superb', 'note', ""'77"", 'show', 'saw', 'had', 'unforgettable', 'mis-step', 'Roundabout', 'Howe', 'Squire', 'play', 'instruments', 'precisely', 'back', 'vocals', 'sound', ""'re"", 'listening', 'studio', 'versions', 'Wakeman', 'White', 'are', 'also', 'as', 'precise', 'studio', 'versions', 'setlist', 'setlist', 'Disc', '1', '65:17', '1', 'Intro/Firebird', 'suite2', 'Going', 'one3', 'Sweet', 'dreams4', 'move/I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'people5', 'Mind', 'drive', 'Part', '1', '26', 'South', 'side', 'sky7', 'Turn', 'century8', 'eyes/Mind', 'drive', 'part', '39', 'Yours', 'disgraceDisc', '2', '85:14', '1', 'meeting', 'room/The', 'meeting2', 'Long', 'distance', 'runaround3', 'Wonderous', 'stories4', 'Time', 'time5', 'Rounabout6', 'Show', 'me7', 'Owner', 'lonely', 'heart8', 'Second', 'initial9', 'Rhythm', 'love10', 'I11', 'Ritual12', 'Every', 'little', 'thing13', 'Starship', 'trooperTotal', 'Time', '150:31', 'Now', 'nice', 'dose', 'picture', 'crystal', 'clear', 'have', 'choice', 'Dolby', 'DTS', '5.1', 'sounded', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'quality', 'nice', 'effect', 'being', 'front', 'row', 'show', 'instead', 'simply', 'sitting', 'front', 'TV.It', 'took', 'away', 'live', 'effect', 'bit', 'skipped', 'pre-1980s', 'stuff', 'first', 'then', 'watched', 'whole', 'show', 'again', 'next', 'evening', 'was', 'really', 'glad', 'did', 'was', 'lot', 'material', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', '1980', 'forward', 'period', 'new', 'newer', 'stuff', 'nice', 'bonus', 'nice', 'have', 'pre-1980', 'stuff', 'why', 'bought', 'disk', 'performed', 'precisely', 'need', 'have', 'Yes', 'fans', 'era.Yes', 'fans', 'need', 'hit', 'buy', 'button', 'now', 'P.S', 'Warning', 'fans', 'were', 'teenagers', 'older', '70s', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'age', 'Yes', 'mind', 'were', 'Yes', '1977', 'Silly', 'know', 'was', 'shock', 'DVD', 'see', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'looking', 'Cryptkeeper', 'still', 'rocked', 'aged', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'literally', 'just', 'stood', 'there', 'keyboards', 'zombie', 'completely', 'emotionlessly', 'still', 'song', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'awesome', 'renditions']",N/A

The production is top notch and the sound is excellent for a live setting.  Play guitar, play drums, bass or sing the hell out of these songs or just meditate and don't move a muscle (okay, even keyboards or a bouzouki will do), you will NOT BELIEVE the incredible level of musicianship these old friends achieve.  If ever anyone had a doubt, even after YES Symphonic - which was great, that YES could ever bring back the magic...you've been far too stingy with your appreciation!This concert disk is a YES-power-totem frisbee soaring to the stratosphere...WE HAVE HEAVEN!  Parts that thrilled me: South Side of the Sky, a deep cut from my favorite album (Fragile)...how great to see this rocked out again (not acoustic), they do a superb job!  Turn of the Century, the lost cut from Going for the One...unbelievably true to the original and played with total finesse and loving care...VERY BEAUTIFUL!  Long Distance Runaround (acoustic) - seeing the classic line-up play this with a playful but powerful tone and spirit - far @#^& out!!  Wouldn't it be nice to sit down with a few friends and play like that so effortlessly?  Wonderous Stories is a melodic, musical magic bell of a composition that Jon channels like a lost hymn.  And You & I is done very sweetly, I love this song, as do most YES fans...INSPIRED - and the set by Roger Dean is really majestic for the atmosphere here.  Ritual, the Topographic favorite of many (Pt. 1 - Revealing Science of God/Dance of the Dawn would be nice) is one of the main highlights for sure, they take this song to the limit!  How do they perform every nuance with such total recall, while still adding 30 years of musical growth?  WOW!  Yours is no Disgrace rivals the Yessongs version - this is one of the jam breaks for Steve.  For me, the huge surprise is this Starship Trooper (Symphonic's version is outstanding too) in the finale, already one of my favorite songs - they sound like Jehovas favorite choir doing this song (delivered with joy by all of them, but Jon particularly), and get a HUGE standing ovation afterwords...UNREAL!  It is a great opportunity to get a good look at great new material like Mind Drive and revisit early works like Sweet Dreams & Every Little Thing.They are so tuned into the magic of the music they have created it is a sight and sound to behold, the audience obviously thinks so!  If only all bands with a great songbook could pull together for a concert gift of this magnitude so many years later!  This line-up of classic members are clearly back on the bus with the music and their relationships, they appear to be getting on very well together which is wonderful (and all healthy and happy).  Having Rick Wakeman back for this concert is reason enough to get it, he effortlessly rocks the house and plays his parts with precision.I see that there IS HOPE for getting older, even into your 60's and beyond, to seem ageless, timeless and plain old KICK ASS as you dance your way to oblivion...and they hopefully will be doing this for a long time to come!  THANK YOU YES for inspiring us all in so many ways!&lt;Sorry> if some are skeptical of YES ravers like me who enjoy this so much...take into account how much of a YES fan you are before you buy because of opinions like mine, although this is a very nice package and a great place to experience the magic of YES!  PEACE YES FANS...ENJOY!P.S. Steve Howe fans...the new Howe solo piece played here, Second Initial, is really cool - He has a new album out (Spectrum - don't have it yet) and a new concert dvd (Remedy Live - I bought it recently and IT IS GREAT).",5,Songs From SAGNOST ........
