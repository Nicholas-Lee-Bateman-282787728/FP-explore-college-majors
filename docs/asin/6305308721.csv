459524,AYQY3RB33F4J6,6305308721,3rdeadly3rd,"[11, 13]","&quot;Revenge&quot; is one of the better entries in the collection of &quot;Pink Panther&quot; comedies, featuring Peter Sellers as the hapless Jacques Clouseau (who we learn has survived &quot;16 assassination attempts, including 2 from his own boss&quot;). The plot is typically flimsy as Clouseau is apparently killed by a businessman with mafia connections, before investigating his own death and turning up in Hong Kong for the showdown. However, the plot is not the important thing here.What is important is the quality performances given by everyone involved. Sellers is at his bumbling best, along with Kwouk as Cato (the Chinese manservant who always seems to be on the receiving end of Clouseau's slapstick). Herbert Lom's Dreyfus - apparently cured upon hearing of Clouseau's death - is not given as much airtime as he deserves, but then again he isn't the emphasis of the film either.It is always hard to pick highlights of a &quot;Pink Panther&quot; film, everyone will have their own favorite pieces. Here are some of my highlights, both from the action and dialogue departments:ACTIONClouseau being attacked by a bondage mistress in his own home - turned into a &quot;Chinese nookie facory&quot; after his death.Cato's glasses making him knock into everything possible in the hotel in Hong Kong.Clouseau and Cato chasing each other up and down the stairs while covered in plaster and paint.Clouseau attempting to answer the phone after this chase and falling down a hole - again.The appearance of Clouseau - disguised as a priest - at his own funeral, making Dreyfus pitch into the grave.The finale in Hong Kong and its aftermath.DIALOGUEDyan Cannon and Sellers upon entering her apartment in the rain: &quot;My God!&quot;, &quot;Mine too&quot;.Sellers to the &quot;beautiful woman&quot; he has just picked up: &quot;Do you mean to say that you do carry a gurn?&quot;Sellers' excuse for blowing a huge trumpet at midnight: &quot;I'm trying to save my life, madam&quot;&quot;Gesundheit&quot;, &quot;I know that, I know that&quot;Clouseau's ridiculous impression of a mafia don.&quot;Do you mean to say that he killed a roving transvestite to impress his godfather?&quot;&quot;Now we are getting somewhere, who is this Phillippe&quot; (it turns out to be the first name of the man they were talking about).&quot;I knew that you knew that I knew that&quot;.&quot;It is a little overdue for a service...&quot;In short, a worthy inclusion in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; canon.

Maybe the series was running out of gas, as I felt it just didn't have the same level of hilarity as the previous movies, but a half funny Pink Panther movie is still funnier than most.  Anyway, this one involves the inspector going up against the French connection.  In a effort to show that they still have muscle, the syndicate decides to assasinate Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau.  To do this, they hire a sort of martial artist super assasin.  I would have liked to seen more done with this part of the story, as they seemed to set it up really well, but the follow through just didn't seem that strong.  Well, the assasin is unable to complete his mission, and the French syndicate tries another method.  In a comic mishap, they end up killing the wrong man, and, thought to be dead, Chief Inspector Clouseau goes underground to try and flush out his would be killers.  My favorite scene in this movie is when Chief Inspector Clouseau goes back to his apartment after he was thought to be dead, only to find that his manservant, Cato, has turned it into a 'Chinese nookie factory'.  His 'meeting' with Lotus Eater Tanya, played by Valerie Leon, was really funny.  A side note, Valerie Leon can also be seen in such movies as Never Say Never Again, The Spy Who Loved Me, Queen Kong, and Blood From The Mummy's Tomb...whotta babe!  Anyway, Chief Inspector Clouseau eventually trails the French syndicate to Hong Kong with the movie basically culminating in a fireworks factory.  Herbert Lom is also back, playing Chief Inspector Dreyfus.  On hearing that Clouseau is dead, he makes a miraculous recovery and is released from the asylum.  He is given is old position back as chief inspector and tasked to find and arrest Clouseau's killer, but given their past relationship, he would like nothing better than to thank them.  There are a number of funny scenes where he sees Clouseau, who is presumed to be dead, and thinks he is having a relapse.  One of my biggest perceived flaws with this movie was Dyan Cannon.  While she is very attractive, and a capable actress, I just felt like she didn't fit in properly with the movie.  She plays Simone Le Gree, one time secretary and lover to the head of the French connection.  She gets mixed up with Clouseau when the French syndicate decides she's more of a liability alive with her intimate knowledge of their operation.  Again, this was another storyline that could have been expanded more, but was glossed over.  So, in closing, while not the best in the series, it certainly provided a number of laughs.",4,Montezuma got his revenge.

This film is actually quite fresh and very enjoyable.  Not only are the regulars in attendance, we get to meet the people who provide Clouseau with his fabulously ridiculous disguises.  It turns out that there is a store that provides them and is owned by one Professor Auguste Balls (done to a T by the remarkable Graham Stark).In this film, Robert Webber plays Phillipe Douvier, who is a gangster that his peers think is losing his edge.  So, he kills Clouseau as a demonstration that he is still a powerful man.  Well, everyone thinks he has killed Clouseau and that leads to most of the delightful humor in the film.  While the familiar elements of Dreyfus and Kato are here, everything is twisted pretty hard and kept fresh even though they are familiar.  We get to find out more about Kato and what he turns to once he thinks Clouseau is gone.  Amazing stuff.Dyan Cannon, at her most stunning, plays Simone Legree (ho, ho, ho) who is Douvier's mistress / secretary.  The mighty Dourvier is afraid of his wife who demands that he end his relationship with Simone which, of course, makes Simone angry and reckless.  Douvier intends to have her killed and she is inadvertently saved by the already deceased Clouseau.  Fireworks ensue.

459532,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305308721,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","I remember trying to watch some of these Pink Panther movies back when I was a kid - and really not getting the humor at all.  Now, all these years later, firmly convinced of Peter Sellers' comic genius after watching Dr. Strangelove, I thought that I would surely laugh heartily at Inspector Clouseau's antics.  It's unfortunate that the first such film to cross my media-consuming path was this one, The Revenge of the Pink Panther, Seller's last true film of the series.  I have no doubt that the earlier films are certifiably funny, but this one really just sort of sits there - no energy, few laughs, and not much of a story.  Sellers' unique accent is funny, but at times it's about all this movie has going for it.As usual, somebody is out to kill Chief Inspector Clouseau - this time it's a dirty businessman named Douvier (Robert Webber) attempting to secure his somewhat weakened position in a French Connection of heroin smuggling.  Again, as usual, Clouseau manages to survive the assassination attempt through a most bizarre, thoroughly bumbling turn of events.  This time, though, the bad guys and everyone else think Clouseau is dead (and Clouseau himself has a little trouble convincing anyone, including his nutty sidekick Cato, that's he's the recently departed Chief Inspector).  Thinking his hated nemesis is finally out of the picture, former Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) leaves the sanitarium and returns to his old job, taking charge of the investigation into Clouseau's murder.  To his horror, though, he can't shove Clouseau out of his mind because he keeps seeing him wherever he goes.  As for Clouseau, he goes ""under covers"" to find the guys who tried to kill him.  With the help of Douvier's former mistress, Simone Legree (Dyan Cannon), he follows the gang to Hong Kong intent on breaking the French Connection case wide open. Hot on his trail is Dreyfus, who has finally become convinced that his sightings of Clouseau were not his indicative of his madness reasserting itself.  With all parties finally together in the same place, a seemingly unavoidable, tiresome chase scene finally brings the activities to an end.I would certainly not advise anyone to repeat my mistake of watching The Revenge of the Pink Panther before seeing any of the first five films.  Those earlier productions were undoubtedly much funnier than this rather tired denouement to Sellers' career as the bumbling detective.  If you weren't particularly enthused about the earlier ones, you undoubtedly won't walk away overly impressed by this one, either.  Some people just don't ""get"" this type of slapstick-oriented comedy - and I may actually be one of those people.  I'm not going to judge the whole series based on this sixth film alone, though, as it's generally regarded by fans as the least entertaining of the bunch (not counting the films that followed Sellers' untimely death in 1980, of course).",3,Not nearly as funny as I expected it to be,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,2922,"['remember', 'trying', 'watch', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'movies', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'really', 'not', 'getting', 'humor', 'Now', 'years', 'later', 'firmly', 'convinced', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'comic', 'genius', 'watching', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'thought', 'would', 'surely', 'heartily', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'antics', 'unfortunate', 'first', 'such', 'film', 'cross', 'media-consuming', 'path', 'was', 'one', 'Revenge', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Seller', 'last', 'true', 'film', 'series', 'have', 'doubt', 'earlier', 'films', 'are', 'certifiably', 'funny', 'one', 'really', 'just', 'sort', 'sits', 'energy', 'few', 'laughs', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'Sellers', 'unique', 'accent', 'funny', 'times', 'movie', 'going', 'it.As', 'usual', 'somebody', 'out', 'kill', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'time', 'dirty', 'businessman', 'named', 'Douvier', 'Robert', 'Webber', 'attempting', 'secure', 'somewhat', 'weakened', 'position', 'French', 'Connection', 'heroin', 'smuggling', 'Again', 'usual', 'Clouseau', 'survive', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'most', 'bizarre', 'thoroughly', 'bumbling', 'turn', 'events', 'time', 'though', 'bad', 'guys', 'everyone', 'else', 'think', 'Clouseau', 'dead', 'Clouseau', 'little', 'trouble', 'convincing', 'anyone', 'including', 'nutty', 'sidekick', 'Cato', 'recently', 'departed', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Thinking', 'hated', 'nemesis', 'finally', 'picture', 'former', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Dreyfus', 'Herbert', 'Lom', 'sanitarium', 'returns', 'old', 'job', 'taking', 'charge', 'investigation', 'Clouseau', 'murder', 'horror', 'though', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shove', 'Clouseau', 'mind', 'seeing', 'Clouseau', 'covers', 'find', 'guys', 'who', 'tried', 'kill', 'help', 'Douvier', 'former', 'mistress', 'Simone', 'Legree', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'gang', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'intent', 'breaking', 'French', 'Connection', 'case', 'wide', 'open', 'Hot', 'trail', 'Dreyfus', 'who', 'finally', 'become', 'convinced', 'sightings', 'Clouseau', 'were', 'not', 'indicative', 'madness', 'reasserting', 'parties', 'finally', 'together', 'same', 'place', 'seemingly', 'unavoidable', 'tiresome', 'chase', 'scene', 'finally', 'activities', 'end.I', 'would', 'certainly', 'not', 'advise', 'anyone', 'repeat', 'mistake', 'watching', 'Revenge', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'seeing', 'first', 'five', 'films', 'earlier', 'productions', 'were', 'undoubtedly', 'much', 'funnier', 'rather', 'tired', 'denouement', 'Sellers', 'career', 'bumbling', 'detective', 'were', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'enthused', 'earlier', 'ones', 'undoubtedly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'overly', 'impressed', 'one', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'type', 'slapstick-oriented', 'comedy', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'one', 'people', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'judge', 'whole', 'series', 'based', 'sixth', 'film', 'alone', 'though', 'generally', 'regarded', 'fans', 'least', 'entertaining', 'bunch', 'not', 'counting', 'films', 'followed', 'Sellers', 'untimely', 'death', '1980', 'course']",N/A

When he picked his material correctly.  When Sellers reassumed the Clouseau character in 1975 with ""The Return of the Pink Panther"" he had been wandering in the wilderness somewhat(see ""The Blockhouse"").  Sellers regained some box office clout but I get the feeling that he may have been slightly bored treading familiar ground.  That said, the Clouseau films probably gave him the standing to capture the part of Chance the Gardener in ""Being There"", arguably his greatest performance.  As for this film, it's consistently funny in a scattershot way but doesn't reach the classic status of ""A Shot in the Dark"".  What I particularly admired here is that Sellers defers some of his screen time to the talented Burt Kwouk as Cato much like he did for Herbert Lom's Dreyfus in ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"".

Krug,"[3, 4]","As others have mentioned before, this one has one glaring logical gap: the mere presense of Chief Inspector Dreyfuss, since he was killed at the end of THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN. Thus it would be best for a newcomer watching the series for the first time to see this one right after watching RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER, then see THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN, as this entry fits in nicely if veiwed as a prequel to the one where Dreyfuss threatens to destroy the world. (Also we don't see or hear about what happens to Dreyfuss after the climax in the fireworks factory, so for all we he know could well have been sent back to the institution.)Anyway. The plot is about the mafia wanting the newly-promoted-to-Chief-Inspector Cluesoue dead. After two failed attempts, involving a bomb and a superhuman martial artist assassin, they think they've succeeded after luring Cluesoue out to a secluded area at night and ambushing his car with gunmen. Now the whole world thinks Cluesoue is dead. But as it turns out, Cluesoue had picked up a hitchhicking transvestite robber just moments earlier, who had then taken both his car and his clothes and then had fallen into the trap meant for Cluesoue. Now it's up to the bumbling detective to find out who tried to kill him and expose them. Along the way he rescues Simone, former secretary of Phillip, the mob boss who has put a contract out on her life. And, of course, former Chief Inspector Dreyfuss, seen locked away in a mental hospidal at the end of RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER, who makes an instant recovery and is happy as a clam when he learns Cluesoue is dead, is having horrible psychological distress at seeing his hated adversary and hoping he's hallucinating, and then being told he's been assigned to catch Cluesoue's killers when he'd rather congradulate them!Other funny moments include: Cluesoue driving out in the Silver Hornet (a car that looks like it came directly out of a comic book and is about the most conspicuous thing you can think of, and besides which has some serious maintanence problems,) Cluesoue coming home after escaping from the loony bin (he told the cops, after being forced to put on the dress the transvestite left him with, that he was Cluesoue and they didn't belive him,) and seeing what Kato has done to the place after thinking his boss died, and Cluesoue's disguises, most notably the ""old sea dog"" one, complete with a blow-up rubber parrot that is so obviously fake, (particularly since he's always having to pump air into it as it keeps deflating,) he'd be better off without it!

459546,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305308721,Reviewer,"[6, 7]","Peter Sellers returns as Chief Inspector Clouseau in this fifth and final installment of the ""Pink Panther"" series, in ""Revenge Of The Pink Panther,"" directed by Blake Edwards.  This time around, Clouseau becomes the target of a drug lord, Douvier (Robert Webber), who finds it necessary to prove to colleagues that he is still ""strong.""  When the assassination attempt is summarily pronounced successful, it affords Clouseau the edge of pursuing the criminals through the use of disguise and the deft application of stealth as only Clouseau could effect.  Meanwhile, former Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is pronounced fit, and returned to his position at the department.  And, as would be expected, it all adds up to a bad time for the criminals, as well as the hapless Dreyfus.  Edwards does a good job with this film, though it's not on a par with the previous outing, ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again,"" which was arguably the best (and funniest) of the series.  There are scenes involving behind-closed-door meetings of the criminal element that seem to bog things down a bit, but with Sellers on hand they seem almost insignificant, for as soon as Clouseau arrives on the scene they're up and running once again.  And Sellers has some classic moments in this one:  Trying on new disguises at the establishment of Dr. Auguste Balls (Graham Stark), a veritable haberdashery for undercover surveillance; posing as a rotund ""Godfather"" and insinuating himself into the mob; and a foray as a peg-legged pirate with an inflatable parrot on his shoulder.  The story line in this one may be considered thin-- Edwards gives it just enough to serve as a setting in which to showcase the talents of his star-- but there's nothing wrong with that; it's funny stuff, and watching Sellers work is worth the price of a ticket alone.  One of the most memorable moments in the film, however, is courtesy of Herbert Lom, as Dreyfus gives the eulogy for the ""late"" Chief Inspector Clouseau and can barely contain his mirth, with his tears of joy construed, of course, as grief.  And for the first time in the series, Clouseau's faithful manservant, Cato (Burt Kwouk) accompanies the Inspector during his investigation, which adds to the merriment, but is not necessarily a boon to getting the case, as Clouseau would say, ""solv-ed.""  The supporting cast includes Dyan Cannon (Simone Legree), Robert Loggia (Marchione), Tony Beckley (Algo), Andre Maranne (Francois), Charles Augins (Vic) and Douglas Wilmer (Police Commissioner).  With &quot;Revenge Of The Pink Panther,"" Edwards delivers an above average comedy that is good for a lot of laughs, and he finishes it off with an extended, slapstick finale that really gives some sock to the overall movie.  What will stay with you forever, however, is the image of Clouseau, and recalling his antics will provide you with some chuckles for a long time afterwards.

Hedges,"[9, 10]","I am an enormous Peter Sellers fan, and love the whole &quot;Pink Panther&quot; series, but while still funny, this is not one of my favorite outings. Sellers is back as Jacques Clouseau, and this time is taking on &quot;The French Connection&quot; crime organization in the midst of a huge heroin transaction that takes them from France to Hong Kong. Robert Webber plays Philippe Douvier, chief of the organization, and while he is smooth, the interactions are more forced and formulaic than in the other &quot;Panther&quot; films. This time the beautiful vixen is played by Dyan Cannon (as Simone Legree), and series stalwart Burt Kwouk returns as the always helpful  Cato (who starts his own business for a new twist...)Also returning (somehow) is the wonderful Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus, although some suspension of belief is needed for the continuity to work inasmuch as he was last seen in &quot;Strikes Again&quot; being atomized by the doomsday machine. Notwithstanding that continuity gaffe, Lom gives the best performance of the film, and in fact single-handedly rescues this installment from a three star rating by virtue of the sublime funeral scene in which he has to give the giggling eulogy for &quot;Clouseau&quot; in what must be one of the funniest scenes ever caught on film.Here the plot seems very contrived and the screenplay devolves frequently to only modestly amusing puns. Clouseau's disguise designer, for instance, is named &quot;Auguste Balls&quot;, and you can see the hilarity that can result. Pretty grade school level, I'm afraid. Also devolving into tedium is the seemingly eternal chase scene at the close of the film, which looks like something the Three Stooges would have done, and set to extremely repetitive, annoying, whistle-laden vaudeville slapstick music.

The best scenes all had Dreyfuss involved in some way. I didn't really like the combat zones that Clouseau and Cato created between themselves, and I'm not sure how a police officer can afford to hire a servant and pay for the damage they both cause, but I suppose that is part of the movie.

Through a strange turn of events and a case of mistaken identity, the mobster thinks he has succeeded in killing Clousea.The Pink Panther was originally a diamond in the first film in this series, but at this point the name has become synonymous with Clouseau.

Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who tried to take over the world and was disintegrated in the previous film is now not only alive and well but is reinstated to a position of responsibility in the police force.But the Pink Panther series isn't about continuity, anyway.  It's about humor.  And Sellers and crew serve it up in generous quantities.  While some routines are recycled from previous films, there are a few new bits that make the movie worthwhile.There are two especially hilarious scenes.  One is a trip through the insane asylum during which Clouseau has a run-in with a jealous ""Hercule Poirot"" (you'll see).  It's subtle, clever, and very funny.  The second is a sequence in which Clouseau finds out his manservant Kato (Burt Kwouk), believing Clouseau to be dead, has turned the detective's apartment into an Oriental brothel.Then there's whacky disguises, Clouseau's ridiculous accent (crazier here than ever), and the comic ""action"" scenes involving shoot-outs and car chases.  Kato is given a bigger sidekick role than usual here, and Sellers' final moment as Clouseau is perfect.
