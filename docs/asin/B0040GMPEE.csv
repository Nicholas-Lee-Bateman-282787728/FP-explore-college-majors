1379213,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0040GMPEE,Carl Manes,"[38, 49]","Vampires and originality don't usually go hand-in-hand in the Horror genre, but Wyatt Weed's breakthrough feature film looks to change that. SHADOWLAND tells the tale of the beautiful vampiress Laura, who awakens from the grave after being locked away for a century only to find herself lost in the modern world. As she struggles to find her place, she must elude the authorities and outrun a vampire hunter that has been sent after her by the church. Unlike so many other forgettable vampire pictures over the years, SHADOWLAND is heavy on character and low on gore, crafting its own rich history and mythology that are each quite unique. The Southern Gothic atmosphere places it in league with many of the classic Hammer films, only set to a contemporary American backdrop. Weed manages to turn back time, returning the streets of San Carlos into a convincing colonial township on a tiny budget. Where he will find some hesitation with the mainstream crowds is in his slow but deliberate pacing, which works well for Gothic film fans, but will likely become an instant turn-off for many of today's audiences. This allows the viewer the time needed to bond with Laura's character throughout her journey, a task that is made easy thanks to Caitlin McIntosh's winning performance. McIntosh is left to act out the first half of the film without any dialog, yet she is still able to convey a range of emotion while drawing the audience in despite this handicap. Although there are very few action sequences, the ones that do make it in are cleverly shot in order to allude to Laura's powers without a heavy reliance on special FX. On top of everything else, SHADOWLAND provides stunning cinematography and an exceptional score that make it a top-contender for 2010!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Shadowland,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,1793,"['Vampires', 'originality', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'Horror', 'genre', 'Wyatt', 'Weed', 'breakthrough', 'feature', 'film', 'change', 'SHADOWLAND', 'tale', 'beautiful', 'vampiress', 'Laura', 'who', 'grave', 'being', 'locked', 'away', 'century', 'only', 'find', 'lost', 'modern', 'world', 'find', 'place', 'must', 'elude', 'authorities', 'outrun', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'been', 'sent', 'church', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'forgettable', 'vampire', 'pictures', 'years', 'SHADOWLAND', 'heavy', 'character', 'low', 'gore', 'crafting', 'own', 'rich', 'history', 'mythology', 'are', 'quite', 'unique', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'atmosphere', 'league', 'many', 'classic', 'Hammer', 'films', 'only', 'set', 'contemporary', 'American', 'backdrop', 'Weed', 'turn', 'back', 'time', 'returning', 'streets', 'San', 'Carlos', 'convincing', 'colonial', 'township', 'tiny', 'budget', 'Where', 'will', 'find', 'hesitation', 'mainstream', 'crowds', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'well', 'Gothic', 'film', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'become', 'instant', 'turn-off', 'many', 'today', 'audiences', 'viewer', 'time', 'needed', 'bond', 'Laura', 'character', 'journey', 'task', 'made', 'easy', 'thanks', 'Caitlin', 'McIntosh', 'winning', 'performance', 'McIntosh', 'left', 'act', 'out', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'dialog', 'still', 'able', 'convey', 'range', 'emotion', 'drawing', 'audience', 'handicap', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'action', 'sequences', 'ones', 'do', 'make', 'are', 'cleverly', 'shot', 'order', 'allude', 'Laura', 'powers', 'heavy', 'reliance', 'special', 'FX', 'top', 'everything', 'else', 'SHADOWLAND', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'exceptional', 'score', 'make', 'top-contender', '2010', '-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

Unfortunately the plot is so weird.It moves back and forth between two centuries to show how Laura (Caitlin McIntosh) ended up being some kind of super-powered non-vampire (in that she doesn't have fangs and can run around in daylight). She runs around searching for the 'old town' and there's a strange sub-plot where she lost a tooth back in the previous century and how Lazarus (Carlos Antonio Le&oacute;n) the vampire who turned her buys it from a modern-day goth.She is chased, or rather tracked by Julian (Jason Contini) who has something akin to a modern Ouiji Board with a crystal pendant that swings out to point in which direction she has taken.Finally they confront each other after more than an hour of next to no vampirisim and she develops a double set of fangs (two upper, two lower) and bites him and suddenly she seems to be more evil then before.She finds her missing tooth (missing a few centuries) and puts it back in her mouth.And this is why the film is so dumb. Most of it is spent by her being chased. She's not a vampire in the chase 'cause she can go out in daylight, and eat regular food, but she has some kind of super-speed, and super-strength. Yet when she was chased and caught and staked 100 years ago she was easily captured by some local villagers. Now, in the present she's being chased by a guy with some supernatural tracking device, as well as scores of police, including elite SWAT unit personnel, and she can defeat them all.If you want a film where a girl is chased by cops for about half a film, then this is the ideal film for you.Caitlin McIntosh has a nice set, but they're only seen in near profile, only once.

Yes, the pieces do come together in a competent and coherent way, but the story is never given a chance to evolve and pull the viewer in.The prolonged chase did not hold my attention as well as I would have liked because the time wasn't utilized to its full potential to tell the story.If I give even a few details it would spoil the story due to its simplistic nature and lack of depth.There is a fair amount of violence without being graphic along with some foul language, but not a lot.

Imo, it's a B+ because of the film quality, sound, and budget.Because of the honesty of those who gave this a 4, I wasn't disappointed. It's not a typical Indie Film by any means. It is better than a made for TV movie which I would say usually deserve a B. This is a B+ which means you don't want to pay a premium price for it as it isn't worth it. It is reasonable entertainment that is NOT on the edge of your seat. Pop it in and kick back the recliner and RELAX.The main character is who makes this film worth watching. She was good and keeps you from complaining and the storyline isn't half bad. So don't pay too much and sit back and relax with this one without too much expectation as we did and when it's over, you'll say well, it wasn't bad and it was an evening's entertainment.Then later once you own it and you do a Vampire movie-a-thon from your DVD collection, this will be at the start followed with your best and favorites at the finish with this one having provided some variety along the way.",4,Not too bad for low budget,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1084,"['Imo', 'real', 'gusto', 'reviews', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'Imo', 'B+', 'film', 'quality', 'sound', 'budget.Because', 'honesty', 'who', 'gave', '4', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'not', 'typical', 'Indie', 'Film', 'means', 'better', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'usually', 'deserve', 'B', 'B+', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'pay', 'premium', 'price', ""n't"", 'worth', 'reasonable', 'entertainment', 'NOT', 'edge', 'seat', 'Pop', 'kick', 'back', 'recliner', 'RELAX.The', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'film', 'watching', 'was', 'good', 'complaining', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'one', 'too', 'much', 'expectation', 'did', 'when', 'over', ""'ll"", 'say', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', 'evening', 'entertainment.Then', 'later', 'once', 'own', 'do', 'Vampire', 'movie-a-thon', 'DVD', 'collection', 'will', 'be', 'start', 'followed', 'best', 'finish', 'one', 'having', 'provided', 'variety', 'way']",N/A
