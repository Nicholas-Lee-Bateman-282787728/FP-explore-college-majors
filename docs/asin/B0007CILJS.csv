Sounding in great voice, the boys re-visit many of their tunes from days passed by and make you glad that they did. With inter-spaced interviews between songs, the concert speaks for itself as it glides through the musical years on a sled of glass. If you enjoyed them then, you will enjoy them now. A must buy for fans who have been running the course for years, and those who are just joining in.

Sure, this concert would definitely have benefitted from 5.1 sound, and other amenities, but the voice of Johnny Maestro, and the solid backup of the Brooklyn Bridge (and the excellent two singers from the former Del Satins), carried this DVD into the Must-Have category.

Had to buy this DVD video after having been a long time fan and seeing Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge live.  So badly wanted to see him again.  This is the only video I know that exists of him performing and it is a must have for any fan.  I watched it on a 42 inch high def TV and the video is crystal clear.  can't wait to play it through my surround system and crank up the volume on those wonderful vocals.
