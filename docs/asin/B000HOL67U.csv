It takes us to the front lines and behind prison bars in the recent war against terrorism.  Like most historical dramas we have a reinactment as well as some actual footage to put together a story of survival and struggle.  Three British muslims go to Afghanastan to attend a wedding of one of their best friends.  In the meantime, U.S. forces have toppled the Taliban and brought enemy forces to their knees.  In the midst of all the bloodshed, the three muslims are taken prisoner where they are flown to Guantanamo prison on the Cuban islands.  They undergo harrowing interrogation and conditions until their identities are found and an investigation frees them after about two years of confinement.  Even though we wouldn't expect U.S. or any other forces to be like kittens, the presentation is eye opening.While I would like to see a similar film presentation where zealous capitalists and reporters have had their heads decapitated, I find this adventure to be captivating in its own right.  'The Road to Guantanamo' grabs your interest from the playful flashbacks of comraderie to the reinacted prison scenes and the actors reliving interviews of each man presented.  Fascinating.(I should note that in all fairness to Hollywood 'A Mighty Heart' certainly fills the bill for what I've written in the former paragraph.)",4,"""War Is Hell""--Especially for the Innocent",1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,1367,"[""'The"", 'Road', 'Guantanamo', 'impressive', 'front', 'lines', 'prison', 'bars', 'recent', 'war', 'terrorism', 'most', 'historical', 'dramas', 'have', 'reinactment', 'as', 'well', 'actual', 'footage', 'put', 'together', 'story', 'survival', 'struggle', 'Three', 'British', 'muslims', 'go', 'Afghanastan', 'attend', 'wedding', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'meantime', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'have', 'toppled', 'Taliban', 'brought', 'enemy', 'forces', 'knees', 'midst', 'bloodshed', 'three', 'muslims', 'are', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'where', 'are', 'flown', 'Guantanamo', 'prison', 'Cuban', 'islands', 'undergo', 'harrowing', 'interrogation', 'conditions', 'identities', 'are', 'found', 'investigation', 'two', 'years', 'confinement', 'Even', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'U.S.', 'other', 'forces', 'be', 'kittens', 'presentation', 'eye', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'similar', 'film', 'presentation', 'where', 'zealous', 'capitalists', 'reporters', 'have', 'had', 'heads', 'decapitated', 'find', 'adventure', 'be', 'captivating', 'own', 'right', 'Road', 'Guantanamo', 'grabs', 'interest', 'playful', 'flashbacks', 'comraderie', 'reinacted', 'prison', 'scenes', 'actors', 'reliving', 'interviews', 'man', 'presented', 'Fascinating', 'should', 'note', 'fairness', 'Hollywood', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Heart', 'certainly', 'bill', 'what', ""'ve"", 'written', 'former', 'paragraph']",N/A

It's obviously a fairly one-sided portrayal of events, especially once the detention parts start, and it's doubtful that everything happened exactly as portrayed, but in a general sense, I think the movie got things right. While the movie certainly suggests torture and mistreatment, I think the thing to take aways from it is how a situation that is normally seen by both sides to be rather black and white, in fact has a lot of gray areas. You almost have to watch the movie a couple times to be sure of what's what. The characters aren't developed very well, and that along with action that develops quickly and chaotically can sometimes create a bit of confusion as to what's happening to whom.",4,Pretty decent,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,807,"['pretty', 'good', 'depiction', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'number', 'people', 'Afghanistan', 'action', 'obviously', 'fairly', 'one-sided', 'portrayal', 'events', 'especially', 'detention', 'parts', 'start', 'doubtful', 'everything', 'happened', 'exactly', 'portrayed', 'general', 'sense', 'think', 'movie', 'got', 'things', 'right', 'movie', 'certainly', 'torture', 'mistreatment', 'think', 'thing', 'take', 'aways', 'how', 'situation', 'normally', 'seen', 'sides', 'be', 'rather', 'black', 'white', 'fact', 'lot', 'gray', 'areas', 'almost', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'couple', 'times', 'be', 'sure', 'what', 'what', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'developed', 'very', 'well', 'action', 'quickly', 'chaotically', 'can', 'sometimes', 'create', 'bit', 'confusion', 'what', 'happening', 'whom']",N/A

Vegan,"[2, 5]","At times when I was watching this film I had tears in my eyes and at other times, I was wondering when this film was ever going to end.This docudrama focuses on the story of the 'Tipton Three' - young guys from Birmingham who went to Pakistan to organize a wedding and decided to make a trip to Afghanistan and ended up getting embroiled in the conflict, captured with Taliban fighters and subsequently picked up by US Marines for the crime of speaking English in a foreign country.  They are then taken into custody by the Marines after surviving near starvation for a month at the hands of the Northern Alliance.What emerges next through interviews with the men and re-enactment of events is a tale of unbelievable treatment of the three men and incompetence at the hands of the US authorities.  Routine humiliation and torture both physical and psychological in Afghanistan before they are sent to Guantanamo Bay, where they somehow endure the same regime for a further two years.On that note, the film only shows one side of the story, it doesn't even attempt to hint that there might be another side as well.  It never shows the Taliban brutality, the brutality of the Islam Extremists, the way they torture, maim and kill for the pleasure of it.  All it shows is American bombs killing poor innocent Afghan civilians.  I don't like Bush or his policies, but I really think if author of this film intended to show US as bad guys he had to invest much more effort into it.Everyone was affected by 9/11 no doubt but there were better ways to rebuild and handle than to jail hundreds of people without due process of law.

If this all sounds unbelievable too you, don't worry it sounds unbelievable to me as well.

Do all people, regardless of race, creed, sex, ethnicity, or political affiliation, deserve legal representation? Watch THE ROAD TO GUANTANAMO and then ask yourself these questions.The Road to Guantanamo is about a group of friends known as The Tipton Three, Middle Eastern men who live in England and decide to travel to Pakistan where one of them plans to be wedded. Although they start out as four, one quickly disappears as they travel across the border into Afghanistan on a roadtrip. Unfortunately for them, this was right at the time the U.S. began its battle with the Taliban. Bombs drop around Shafiq, Ruhel, Monir, and Asif, the young men who start out on this hellish journey. They quickly try to get away but are led into even more dangerous areas by suspicious men with guns who lock them up in cargo trucks or force them to trek into the desert. Soon, U.S. and British forces arrive and take Shafiq, Ruhel, and Asif into custody. The whereabouts of Monir are never discovered. His body is never found.Filmed using actors and the original Tipton three, the documentary is a disturbing treatise on prisoners of war. That we see the bizarre circumstances leading to their ""arrest"" and incarceration is even more disturbing considering these men were officially residents of England. But because they have Middle Eastern blood in their veins, they are immediately labeled as terrorists or Taliban fighters or (unbelievably) Al Qaeda.The road that The Three travel is horrifying. Death hits near them on every stretch, nearly killing one or all of them at some point; whether its dysentery, Allied bombs, or torture.It is this last that we become painfully aware of as The Three enter Cuba and the ""Gitmo"" detention center. Never having been charged with a single crime, nor having evidence against them, the U.S. forces continually inflict terrible pains on the men. Isolation. Loud music for hours and hours. Sitting in the scalding heat day in and day out. Being knocked down time and again during interrogations when they don't give the interrogators the information they ""want to hear.""Held for a little over two years, The Three are finally released without charges and returned to England. No apologies. No legal recourse. Nothing is available to them.All of this sounds completely un-American and cruel. And it is. But there are some interesting points hit upon in the documentary that are simply left dangling, leaving it up to the audience to decide what they mean. Most importantly is that there's really no explanation as to why The Three decided to go into Afghanistan in the first place. They just do. One might assume that they did it as a kind of fun roadtrip that went terribly awry. But this isn't stated outright.Still, the cost of freedom is implicitly felt throughout the film as the audience watches these men denied any sort of legal representation and then subjected to torture techniques that skim the legalities of The Geneva Convention.",5,How Much Will We Pay For Our Freedoms?,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,3051,"['How', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'considering', 'price', 'freedoms', 'liberties', 'Do', 'people', 'regardless', 'race', 'creed', 'sex', 'ethnicity', 'political', 'affiliation', 'deserve', 'legal', 'representation', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'GUANTANAMO', 'then', 'ask', 'questions.The', 'Road', 'Guantanamo', 'group', 'friends', 'known', 'Tipton', 'Three', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'men', 'who', 'live', 'England', 'decide', 'travel', 'Pakistan', 'where', 'one', 'be', 'wedded', 'start', 'out', 'as', 'four', 'one', 'quickly', 'travel', 'border', 'Afghanistan', 'roadtrip', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'right', 'time', 'U.S.', 'began', 'battle', 'Taliban', 'Bombs', 'drop', 'around', 'Shafiq', 'Ruhel', 'Monir', 'Asif', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'start', 'out', 'hellish', 'journey', 'quickly', 'try', 'get', 'away', 'are', 'led', 'even', 'more', 'dangerous', 'areas', 'suspicious', 'men', 'guns', 'who', 'lock', 'up', 'cargo', 'trucks', 'force', 'trek', 'desert', 'Soon', 'U.S.', 'British', 'forces', 'arrive', 'take', 'Shafiq', 'Ruhel', 'Asif', 'custody', 'whereabouts', 'Monir', 'are', 'never', 'discovered', 'body', 'never', 'found.Filmed', 'using', 'actors', 'original', 'Tipton', 'three', 'documentary', 'disturbing', 'treatise', 'prisoners', 'war', 'see', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'leading', 'arrest', 'incarceration', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'considering', 'men', 'were', 'officially', 'residents', 'England', 'have', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'blood', 'veins', 'are', 'immediately', 'labeled', 'terrorists', 'Taliban', 'fighters', 'unbelievably', 'Al', 'Qaeda.The', 'road', 'Three', 'travel', 'horrifying', 'Death', 'hits', 'near', 'stretch', 'nearly', 'killing', 'one', 'point', 'dysentery', 'Allied', 'bombs', 'torture.It', 'last', 'become', 'painfully', 'aware', 'Three', 'enter', 'Cuba', 'Gitmo', 'detention', 'center', 'Never', 'having', 'been', 'charged', 'single', 'crime', 'having', 'evidence', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'continually', 'inflict', 'terrible', 'pains', 'men', 'Isolation', 'Loud', 'music', 'hours', 'hours', 'Sitting', 'scalding', 'heat', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'Being', 'knocked', 'time', 'again', 'interrogations', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'interrogators', 'information', 'want', 'hear', 'Held', 'little', 'two', 'years', 'Three', 'are', 'finally', 'released', 'charges', 'returned', 'England', 'apologies', 'legal', 'recourse', 'Nothing', 'available', 'them.All', 'completely', 'un-American', 'cruel', 'are', 'interesting', 'points', 'hit', 'upon', 'documentary', 'are', 'simply', 'left', 'dangling', 'leaving', 'audience', 'decide', 'what', 'mean', 'Most', 'importantly', 'really', 'explanation', 'why', 'Three', 'decided', 'go', 'Afghanistan', 'first', 'place', 'just', 'do', 'One', 'might', 'assume', 'did', 'kind', 'fun', 'roadtrip', 'went', 'terribly', 'awry', ""n't"", 'stated', 'outright.Still', 'cost', 'freedom', 'implicitly', 'felt', 'film', 'audience', 'men', 'denied', 'sort', 'legal', 'representation', 'then', 'subjected', 'torture', 'techniques', 'skim', 'legalities', 'Geneva', 'Convention']",N/A
1015377,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000HOL67U,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[7, 9]","Road to Guantanamo is a movie about the inhumane conditions inflicted on three Muslim men who spent almost three years at the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba. This movie is part drama and part documentary. The majority of the film uses dramatizations of the actual events with actors playing three Muslim Englishmen and the military personnel who capture them. The remaining parts of the movie include actual interviews with the three guys and some archive footage of Donald Rumsfeld, George W. Bush, and others.Directors Michal Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross attempt to tackle a very large, controversial subject with Road to Guantanamo and rather than stick to the usual documentary formula of expert testimony, archive footage, and interviews, they decided to try something a little different. Using actors, this docu- drama attempts to let the outside world see what conditions are like inside Guantanamo Bay. The prisoners who suffer at the hands of the military personnel number far more than Asif, Ruhal, and Shafiq. Like the dramatizations show, most everyone at this military base was subject to daily doses of humiliation, physical pain, and mental torture as different captors tried to extract confessions of guilt from the three men and those around them.Among the scenes in this movie, the ones that are most memorable are those taken at prison (a dramatization- it wasn't really filmed there). Watch in disgust as the military people rough up uncooperative prisoners; force the men to sit in physically uncomfortable positions; force the men to listen to loud, blaring music; deny them of their right to pray each day; etc. And, of course, there was plenty of dishonesty on the part of the military personnel when it came time to interrogate. Why was all of this done? To try to get one or all of the men to confess to having some involvement in the Al Qaeda led attacks on September 11, 2001, or to at least obtain some information about Osama Bin Laden and where he might be hiding. Most viewers will find this part of the film moving, regardless of whether or not they agree with this type of interrogation. Personally, I don't like the way things are handled when it comes to POW's and interrogation but, on the other hand, this is war and during war you cannot always be nice and friendly to your captives, especially when you are trying to get information from them that could lead to the arrest of a known killer.This docu- drama is intended to illustrate the horrors of war and the human rights abuses that often take place when prisoners of war are interrogated. It fulfills its task effectively in some ways but not in others. The scenes taken from the prison are among the best in the film, even if they are performed by actors, because they let the world see what it was like to spend time in these prisons as an innocent person. I know that many have denied the human rights abuses at Guantanamo Bay but I think what this docu- drama portrays is pretty accurate. The reason I say this is because the conditions depicted, while nasty and certainly undesirable, are not nearly as bad as they could be and they don't come close to the torture inflicted on POW's in other countries. In other words, I don't think anyone can say that the alleged conditions displayed in this movie are exaggerated. They seem to be right on the mark and while they are nothing to be proud of, they are not as horrifying as the stories told by POW's from other wars, like Vietnam.As far as the viewpoints offered, Road to Guantanamo doesn't offer a balanced picture by any stretch and this should come as no surprise to anyone since the goal of this docu- drama is to gain sympathy for these three innocent men (and others like them) who lost nearly three years of their lives in a military prison. But this lack of any balance is one of the movie's downfalls. Not only is there no counter argument from military personnel, there is no commentary from any one else except the three men themselves. It is nice that these three men are willing to come forward and offer their take on the brutality of war but the movie would have been much more effective if it included at least some commentary by others; like, say, human rights experts, political analysts, military experts, etc. The viewing public fully expects the three men who were held captive to have nothing but negative things to say about the experience. We expect that. But it takes more than one side to make a documentary of this type believable and the filmmakers should have expanded the movie to include commentary from others as further proof of the film's conclusions.Another thing I'm not too happy with about Road to Guantanamo is the DVD; specifically, the lack of extras. The only things you get on the DVD are a scene selection option, previews, and other usual things you get on all DVD's. Here, once again, the directors blew a golden opportunity. The movie makes you want to know more about this controversy and the directors could have fulfilled that curiosity and added to the film's credibility with some educational DVD extras. But they don't offer anything to satisfy the viewer's cravings for more information.The three men portrayed in this documentary did win release from prison in 2004 and the charges were dismissed. They each maintained their innocence which was later proven true. They kept their spirits throughout this time of injustice and they have now emerged stronger than ever. Each of the men talks at length on this documentary about the experience and they claim that their personal character and Muslim faith are now impenetrable thanks to the negative experience at Guantanamo Bay.Overall, Road to Guantanamo is a pretty good film with an important message about POW and the proper way to treat them. It is very one- sided and inconsistent and it falls short of the great documentary it could have been because of its lack of expert testimony and other persuasive/educational material. But it is still a good documentary/drama about the horrors of life as a POW and it is worth a watch.",3,War on Terror POW's Tell Their Side of the Story,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,6095,"['Road',

Apparently, before getting married, they decide to go to Afghanistan to ""help""(never clarified what help they meant to give)and to eat big naans(large flat bread). While in Afghanistan, they eat some naans, get bored, and decide to go back to Pakistan, but nothing is mentioned about any ""help"" they rendered.

The topic is touchy and flamable and likely to stir upp emotions. That fact that captives are being held in Guantanamo against any legal precedence under extremely questionable conditions is worthy of report. Sadly this film is a very one sided affair, you are left with no explanation as to why the good Englishmen Rasul, Ahmed and Iqbal decide to leave Pakistan where Iqbal is suposed to get married (in what appears to be an arranged marriage (since we are on the topic of human rights)) and go to Taliban Afganistan, in fact yes there was some mention of helping the poor - but then again there was also mention of going to Afganistan because there are so big naan breads there, take a pick since neither is plausible.Nor is there a satisfactory explanation as to why our good three friends are arrested there on a truck with a group of armed Talibans. We do get some screen time showing that one of the three was very sick and we are led to believe they are very good people, all willing to help their fellow humans but I doubt Michael Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross spent any effort finding out why they were there and took their story for face value. We do however later on receive information that at least two of them where petty criminals with extensive records in the UK and in my experience petty criminals normally don't go far out of their way in helping people in general.I have no doubt that atrocity's are being committed at Guantanamo but I could not feel sorry for the trio which are portrayed as heros and have a strong suspicion that you are getting convenient half truths at certain parts of the story.

1015380,A3080YC6R9G303,B000HOL67U,Greg Robertson,"[3, 4]","Shot documentary-style, although not a pure documentary because the Bush Administration and CIA were less than cooperative, this film delivers a very telling ""inside look"" at the capture and imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay of three British citizens accidentally caught up in the American invasion of Afghanistan.  It's worth noting, too, that since this film came out, over 4 dozen MORE captives have been released after it was discovered they were innocent of everything except being sold to American forces by the Northern Alliance.If this film is an accurate depiction, and no evidence has come forth to show that it's not, the worst we can say about ""The Tipton Three,"" as they are now known, is that they acted stupidly in taking ""a side trip"" into Afghanistan at a time when the American invasion was heating up.  On the other hand, again if the film is accurate, the Bush Administration's approach to justice and human rights is appalling and NEEDS to have the light of day shown on its abuses and corrupt policies.Just to be clear, as it is depicted here, the way the American military treated its prisoners in Afghanistan was not wrong in any way.  After all, a lot of tough, even cruel steps MUST be taken to keep soldiers alive during a war.  Even the captives in this film don't complain about their initial treatment by Americans, although subsequent captives have.  The real abuses took place at Guantanamo, and in Washington, when decisions were made to label all of the captives as killers who ""hate us because of our freedom,"" even when officials KNEW that many of those captured were innocent.  That's not just abuse of power, after all, that's cowardice that undercuts our country's moral authority in all future foreign matters.Beyond politics and human rights abuses, the young actors who portray the three Brits, as well as those portraying Northern Alliance and American soldiers, have done an excellent job here.  While it's always obvious that this is something of a morality play, given its documentary nature, you definitely get a feel for the abject poverty, somewhat disgusting health conditions, and gritty feel of day-to-day life in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan.  Likewise, they do a great job of not painting all of the American soldiers and guards as abusive, putting the blame for abuses that DO occur squarely on the senior-level people who are making the rules, even occasionally showing empathy by some of the low level soldiers/guards.""The Road to Guantanamo"" is one group of people's story, and never claims to be the whole story.  I also found it hard to watch at times because, as an American, I like to think that while we may need to be tough at times, we always strive to be fair.  This film puts that into serious question, on many levels.  On the other hand, if we can't take criticism when we as a people DON'T do things right, our credibility will only shrink.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[6, 8]","Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross, is a docudrama, inspired in the events that surrounded the incarceration of three British citizens in Guantanamo, and their stay there for long years.How did all start? Asif (Afran Usman) travels from Tipton -England- to Pakistan in 2001, to meet his future wife, as his family arranged. His friends Ruhel (Farhad Harun), Shafiq (Riz Ahmed), and Monir (Waqar Siddiqui) decide to travel to Pakistan too, in order to go to Asif's wedding. This film doesn't show too clearly how on earth these four British Muslims decided that, given that they were already in Pakistan, crossing the border to Afghanistan was a good idea. That decision seems specially strange given that Afghanistan was on the brink of war with the United States.All the same, I suppose I should continue summing up the plot of this movie... As we all know, that war did happen, and these four men were in the midst of everything. One of them, Monir, was lost forever, never to be seen again. Asif, Ruhel and Shafiq somehow ended being captured by the Northern Alliance as members of Al-Qaeda, and transported to Guantanamo by Americans. At Guantanamo they endured all kinds of torture in order to force them to confess to being terrorists, even though facts didn't agree with the version the American military at Guantanamo wanted these three men to back up.Asif, Ruhel and Shafiq, also called ""The Tipton three"", are shown as people who were far from being saints, but that were also quite far from being terrorists. Why were they sent to Guantanamo, and why weren't they released once it was discovered that facts didn't back up the accusations leveled against them? And what about the stories they tell of torture and disrespect to religion at Guantanamo Bay? What happened to human rights?It is highly likely that ""The Road To Guantanamo"" doesn't tell the whole truth, just a version of it. Nonetheless, I think this controversial docudrama needs to be seen, because I'm pretty sure at least part of what it says is true, particularly the blatant disregard for human rights shown at Guantanamo Bay. And that is a shame, the kind of event we simply must be aware of and take a stance against, if we want things to change.

Asif Iqbal, Ruhel Ahmed, and Shafiq Rasul had traveled to Pakistan for Asif's wedding. On a lark, the group foolishly took a trip to Afghanistan at the worst possible time: October 2001, when the United States invaded Afghanistan following the attacks of September 11. Caught in the bloody melee of bombings and Taliban resistance, the men ended up among Taliban fighters as they tried to return to Pakistan. The threesome were arrested by the Northern Alliance, which turned them over to the U.S. military. Initially relieved to be in U.S. custody, they soon found that the Americans were determined to find them guilty of being jihadists. And if evidence was lacking, their captors were willing to coerce confessions.The story is told through interviews with Asif, Ruhel, and Shafiq and through re-enactments of their experiences, where the men are played by actors. Michael Winterbottom directed this film, which initially struck me as not being as polished as his fiction films. But, upon reflection, the recreations of the bloodshed in Afghanistan and life for the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are fairly meticulous and expert. Winterbottom undoubtedly did not want to give the impression of polish or contrivance, but of immediacy and realism in depicting the ordeal these three men suffered.  The men were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay from January 2002 to March 2004, first at ""Camp X-Ray"" and then at ""Camp Delta"". I'm inclined to believe their accounts of their experiences there, as the descriptions are similar to those related by other former Guantanamo and ""black site"" detainees.The men were tortured, deprived of sleep, and, for months, not allowed to stand or walk more than 5 minutes per week. This is not news, though this film offers more detail of the treatment of detainees than I've read in print. The strategies and apparent motivations of the American interrogators might be more damning. Military officers charged with finding ""bad people"" and eliciting information are under a lot of pressure to produce results. So they pass even unlikely culprits up the chain of command, until the prisoners get to Guantanamo Bay, by which time it should be painfully obvious that they don't possess useful information. Asking the same question for 2 years is unlikely to produce a different answer. In a pitiful effort to find ""The Tipton Three"" guilty of something, the U.S. claimed to have photographs placing them at an Al Qaeda rally in Afghanistan in 2000, a time for which the men had easily verifiable alibis. But that didn't stop their captors from torturing a confession out of them.We can only be grateful that Asif, Ruhel, and Shafiq did not sustain long-term injury from the abominable treatment they endured. Egyptian President Nasser's imprisonment and torture of Muslim Brotherhood partisans in the 1960s, whether or not they had committed any crime, galvanized their contempt of secular government and the West. These Westernized Pakistani Brits from Tipton have become more observant Muslims as a result of their ordeal.

For giggles in the midst of massive American-led military actions, the lads decided to hop the Afghan border and head for Kandahar, home of the Taliban (as you do).This preposterous, though well filmed 'innocents caught up in a nightmare' tale that director Mat Whitecross, launches is clear from that beginning that the truth of this story emanates solely from the mouths of Asif and his mates. They comment on their personal road to Guantanamo, while actors demonstrate what we are being told happened.President Bush decided soon after the September attack, that he was going after the bad guys, and if that meant judicial fiat, respect for constitutional principals and international law were to be thrown out of the window, so be it. So here we have yet another botched, ill-conceived, shoot-from-the-hip plan to thwart terrorism, that does little more than give succor to the enemy and trample our moral highground.Asif, and his colleagues were likely mistreated and undoubtedly had their human rights soiled at Guantanamo. To date this debacle of a prison that masquerades as American law has given us not a single convicted poster boy to demonstrate the effectiveness of the policy of 'Rendition.'Those released without charge such as the subjects of this documentary, serve as motivators for the anti-western forces of Jihad, and they will garner sympathy from gullible Kuffar liberals who swallow this Islamoganda hook line and sinker. The fact that this movie was able to be made however lays at the feet of the Bush administration, for it is they that established back door rules of engagement as they pretended to effect law and order.

That crucial question is left unanswered.Did these boys go to fight and then on seeing the realities of War try and escape?The resulting experiences these boys were made to suffer are inexcusable in a modern world.

The treatment of the prisoners is not pretty although nowhere near the horrific cruelty that went on at, for instance, Abu Ghraib during Saddam Hussein's reign.The emotional impact of the film is lessened somewhat by the aloofness of the four boys but the filmmakers are to be commended for making a film of this scale on such a low budget.In the end Winterbottom is preaching to the converted here - I'm not so sure it will change people's attitudes either way.",3,Moderately successful critique of Guantanamo,1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,1228,"['Road', 'Guantanamo', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'attempt', 'criticise', 'American', 'methods', 'treating', 'terror', 'suspects', 'detention', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'Winterbottom', 'story', 'three', 'apparently', 'innocent', 'English', 'Muslims', 'who', 'number', 'twists', 'turns', 'ended', 'up', 'Guantanamo.It', 'little', 'hard', 'understand', 'naivety', 'boys', 'who', 'journey', 'Afghanistan', 'end', 'up', 'Taleban', 'just', 'Americans', 'are', 'attack', 'post', '9/11', 'atrocities', 'Heck', 'pretty', 'suspicious', 'wonder', 'Americans', 'were', 'dubious', 'innocence', 'boys', 'are', 'knocked', 'bit', 'Americans', 'were', 'angry', 'post', '9/11', 'not', 'exactly', 'polite', 'suspected', 'terrorists.The', 'story', 'really', 'up', 'when', 'boys', 'are', 'moved', 'Guantanamo', 'treatment', 'prisoners', 'not', 'pretty', 'nowhere', 'horrific', 'cruelty', 'went', 'instance', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'reign.The', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film', 'lessened', 'somewhat', 'aloofness', 'four', 'boys', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'making', 'film', 'scale', 'low', 'budget.In', 'end', 'Winterbottom', 'preaching', 'converted', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'will', 'change', 'people', 'attitudes', 'way']",N/A

Schultz,"[1, 3]","I think there are several documentaries out there that might make a better case against our unwarranted detention and inhumane treatment of prisoners at the Guantanamo Prison and elsewhere. This film omits too much to give the viewer a clear idea of what happened and why. The presentation is as bumpy as some of the roads the young English-Pakistanis traveled over getting to and from Afghanistan.This is the story of four students in England going back to their native Pakistan for the wedding of one of them. When they arrive in Pakistan, they decide to take a side-trip into Afghanistan, presumably just to see what's happening there, although this is one of the points in the narrative that is not made clear.When the young men attempt to leave Afghanistan, they get caught up in a mass exodus of refugees (although again, who all these migrating people are is not made clear). They fall under fire, and one of their number is presumably killed. The other three are taken prisoner and end up in protracted detention in Guantanamo.Along the way, the Americans/Allies subject them to sometimes brutal, always highly officious, inhumane treatment. However, this chronicle of their plight sorely calls for some commentary - something not supplied on the DVD.It is also hard to fully feel the sting of the injustice these young men suffer because they themselves seem to be such globally blunted, hostile, unsympathetic individuals. The fact that they don't make nice-nice with their captors should in no way cause the viewer to feel less indignant about the ordeal they are made to suffer. In fact, I suppose one should admire the young Pakistanis all the more for not kowtowing to their interrogators. But they just come across as being such unpleasant people, even in their previous private lives, that they seem to be almost self-destructively inviting persecution.But it is hard to really judge anyone's actions here, because we don't really get to know anyone, and the timeline of events is so full of holes.

Three naive young men fly from England to Pakistan soon after 9/11, purportedly to prepare for a wedding, and almost immediately find their way into Afghanistan.  They wander onto a battlefield with no clear intentions, plan, or preparation; silly tourists cluttering up the battlespace while the twenty-first-century U.S. Airforce unleashes its arsenal all around them.  Shot on location, the confusion, carnage, and casual Afghani brutality is riveting.  Eventually captured and handed over to the U.S., much surprise is expressed at the treatment the two surviving detainees received.  But that treatment will come as no surprise to several million Americans, themselves veterans of the U.S. military.  Anyone who has been through some of the more stringent military training, such as basic training before the 1980s, Ranger School, Special Forces, or survival-escape-evasion, will be quite familiar with stress positions, screaming, loud noises and strobe lights, sensory deprivation, punching, kicking, more screaming, extremes of heat and cold, lack of food or sleep, and so on.  In short, do not wander onto a battlefield unless you are absolutely committed and prepared.  ""The Road to Guantanamo"" is an excellent introduction for those who are unaware of the business-end of the so-called war on terror, and it is a detailed account that is impossible to dismiss.

1015394,ABN7RI1VBAKE5,B000HOL67U,Steve Stubbs,"[9, 27]","Instead of Road to Guantanamo this film should have been titled These Guys Are Not the Sharpest Tools in the Shed.  It follows the odyssey of three bearded weirdos from England who had been to Afghanistan before to train for the jihad and to listen to speeches by Osama bin Laden, and who decided to go back and shoot some infidels.  They thought that would be all kinds of fun, but they went to northern Afghanistan with no weapons, very minimal training, and no idea where their unit was or whom their unit commander was or if they even had one.  Instead of having a fun trip, they learned to their shock and amazement that the infidel they were planning to shoot is likely to shoot back.  They were further shocked and amazed that when they were captured by the Northern Alliance they found out people in Afghanistan do not like foreign troublemakers coming into their country to fight for their enemies.  If these clowns are typical products of the British educational system, things must be far worse in that country than anyone had hitherto suspected.From the perspective of the beardos it gets worse.  The Northern Alliance turns them over to US troops who seem to have a small minded attitude toward al Qaeda fighters.  What they thought would be a fun trip in the hills was turning out to be not fun, not fun at all.  After a major Taliban riot in a detention center run by the Northern Alliance in northern Afghanistan the US started using crowd control tactics with their detainees such as hooding them when they were being transported.  It's hard to riot if you can't see what you are doing.  The world was of course shocked, especially since these methods proved to be effective and there were no further riots.  Hooded and shackled, the jihadis were transported to Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo, to the shock and horror of their jihadi supporters throughout the anti-American world.  There they were subjected to military discipline, Marine style.  Nobody pretends they were tortured, but they thought as jihadis plotting to kill the infidel they would be invited to crumpets and tea.  The Marines are not noted for that sort of thing.The CIA had pictures and videos of all these men at an Osama bin Laden speech, but they had the wrong date for the event.  As a result the men, who were all professional criminals in England, could prove that they were in jail or on probation during the entire time the CIA thought they were in Afghanistan.  The movie makes it appear that as career criminals they spent almost all their time in England in jail or on probation except when they were in al Qaeda training camps learning terror tactics.  By this time the film makers expect you to be shedding tears from every pore for these guys, but somehow I was not able to dredge up much sympathy.  I was left thinking they should still be at Guantanamo, and not necessarily above ground, either.In short, the movie had an effect on me which was the exact opposite of the one the film makers had in mind, inasmuch as the Marines and not a troop of unshaven wack jobs from England seemed to be the heroes.  But even though it fails miserably as a pro-jihadi tear jerker it is well worth a look see.",5,A tale of three idiots yet well worth seeing,1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,3194,"['Instead', 'Road', 'Guantanamo', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'Guys', 'Are', 'Not', 'Sharpest', 'Tools', 'Shed', 'odyssey', 'three', 'bearded', 'weirdos', 'England', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'Afghanistan', 'train', 'jihad', 'listen', 'speeches', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'who', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'shoot', 'infidels', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'kinds', 'fun', 'went', 'northern', 'Afghanistan', 'weapons', 'very', 'minimal', 'training', 'idea', 'where', 'unit', 'was', 'whom', 'unit', 'commander', 'was', 'even', 'had', 'one', 'Instead', 'having', 'fun', 'trip', 'learned', 'shock', 'amazement', 'infidel', 'were', 'planning', 'shoot', 'likely', 'shoot', 'back', 'were', 'further', 'shocked', 'amazed', 'when', 'were', 'captured', 'Northern', 'Alliance', 'found', 'out', 'people', 'Afghanistan', 'do', 'not', 'foreign', 'troublemakers', 'coming', 'country', 'fight', 'enemies', 'clowns', 'are', 'typical', 'products', 'British', 'educational', 'system', 'things', 'must', 'be', 'far', 'worse', 'country', 'anyone', 'had', 'hitherto', 'perspective', 'beardos', 'worse', 'Northern', 'Alliance', 'US', 'troops', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'small', 'minded', 'attitude', 'al', 'Qaeda', 'fighters', 'What', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'trip', 'hills', 'was', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'fun', 'not', 'fun', 'major', 'Taliban', 'riot', 'detention', 'center', 'run', 'Northern', 'Alliance', 'northern', 'Afghanistan', 'US', 'started', 'using', 'crowd', 'control', 'tactics', 'detainees', 'such', 'hooding', 'when', 'were', 'being', 'transported', 'hard', 'riot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'world', 'was', 'course', 'shocked', 'especially', 'methods', 'proved', 'be', 'effective', 'were', 'further', 'riots', 'Hooded', 'shackled', 'jihadis', 'were', 'transported', 'Camp', 'X-Ray', 'Guantanamo', 'shock', 'horror', 'jihadi', 'supporters', 'anti-American', 'world', 'were', 'subjected', 'military', 'discipline', 'Marine', 'style', 'Nobody', 'were', 'tortured', 'thought', 'jihadis', 'plotting', 'kill', 'infidel', 'would', 'be', 'invited', 'crumpets', 'tea', 'Marines', 'are', 'not', 'noted', 'sort', 'thing.The', 'CIA', 'had', 'pictures', 'videos', 'men', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'speech', 'had', 'wrong', 'date', 'event', 'result', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'professional', 'criminals', 'England', 'could', 'prove', 'were', 'jail', 'probation', 'entire', 'time', 'CIA', 'thought', 'were', 'Afghanistan', 'movie', 'appear', 'career', 'criminals', 'spent', 'almost', 'time', 'England', 'jail', 'probation', 'when', 'were', 'al', 'Qaeda', 'training', 'camps', 'learning', 'terror', 'tactics', 'time', 'film', 'makers', 'expect', 'be', 'shedding', 'tears', 'pore', 'guys', 'somehow', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'dredge', 'up', 'much', 'sympathy', 'was', 'left', 'thinking', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'Guantanamo', 'not', 'necessarily', 'ground', 'either.In', 'short', 'movie', 'had', 'effect', 'was', 'exact', 'opposite', 'one', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'mind', 'inasmuch', 'Marines', 'not', 'troop', 'unshaven', 'wack', 'jobs', 'England', 'seemed', 'be', 'heroes', 'even', 'miserably', 'pro-jihadi', 'tear', 'jerker', 'well', 'look', 'see']",N/A

More on that in a minute.Three British citizens from Pakistan flew back to Pakistan for the wedding of one of them. They visited Afghanistan just as the US bombing began there. They got caught into the quagmire that eventually led them to the US Camp in Guantanamo (Gitmo).The atrocities commited while the guys were in the custody of the Afghan militia bear notice. One of them was placed in a truck with no ventilation. In short, people on board couldn't breathe. Late at night, a prisoner on another truck heard gunfire. Apparently the militia was providing ventilation using a rifle. The next morning, many on that truck were dead. The British citizen, fortunately, was not among them.Oh, and one of the ""prisoners"" disappeared in the process, and is presumed dead.Eventually the others ended up in the cages in Gitmo. They weren't allowed to talk to the guy in the next cage, their Korans were thrown around abusively. One other prisoner whom the lead characters noted was obviously mentally disturbed was beaten mercilessly. All of them were manhandled. And they were interogated every day with the same questions. ""Your buddy said you WERE at the meeting with Osama bin Laden."" To which the prisoners responded--each and every time--""Who's Osama bin Laden? And what is this organization whose meeting I was supposed to have attended?""The guys were eventually released. But the film mentioned that upwards of 750 have been held. Gitmo now has over 500 ten of whom have been charged with anything and none convicted.This is a must for anyone who purports to care about the US Constitution or anything for which the so-called founding fathers ostensibly stood. You have to see it to believe it (not that abuse in prisons has NOT been an issue for decades anyway, but that's a completely different story.)I regret, though, that it is a docudrama. I'm not so naive as to assume the producers could have gotten more real footage, but that's my ideal. With a docudrama, good thinking people can challenge the credibility of those testifying. Unfortunately, given the circumstances, this is the best that can be done.So, yes, don't miss it and come to your own conclusions. And ask, ""What if those being held were my family members or relatives? How would I respond?""",4,Excellent docudrama,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,2323,"['Then', 'why', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'Well', 'was', 'docudrama', 'More', 'minute.Three', 'British', 'citizens', 'Pakistan', 'flew', 'back', 'Pakistan', 'wedding', 'one', 'visited', 'Afghanistan', 'just', 'US', 'bombing', 'began', 'there', 'got', 'caught', 'quagmire', 'eventually', 'led', 'US', 'Camp', 'Guantanamo', 'Gitmo', '.The', 'atrocities', 'commited', 'guys', 'were', 'custody', 'Afghan', 'militia', 'bear', 'notice', 'One', 'was', 'placed', 'truck', 'ventilation', 'short', 'people', 'board', 'could', ""n't"", 'breathe', 'Late', 'night', 'prisoner', 'truck', 'heard', 'gunfire', 'Apparently', 'militia', 'was', 'providing', 'ventilation', 'using', 'rifle', 'next', 'morning', 'many', 'truck', 'were', 'dead', 'British', 'citizen', 'fortunately', 'was', 'not', 'them.Oh', 'one', 'prisoners', 'disappeared', 'process', 'presumed', 'dead.Eventually', 'others', 'ended', 'up', 'cages', 'Gitmo', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'talk', 'guy', 'next', 'cage', 'Korans', 'were', 'thrown', 'around', 'abusively', 'One', 'other', 'prisoner', 'whom', 'lead', 'characters', 'noted', 'was', 'obviously', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'was', 'beaten', 'mercilessly', 'were', 'manhandled', 'were', 'interogated', 'day', 'same', 'questions', 'buddy', 'said', 'WERE', 'meeting', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'prisoners', 'responded', 'time', 'Who', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'what', 'organization', 'meeting', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'attended', 'guys', 'were', 'eventually', 'released', 'film', 'mentioned', 'upwards', '750', 'have', 'been', 'held', 'Gitmo', 'now', 'over', '500', 'ten', 'whom', 'have', 'been', 'charged', 'anything', 'none', 'convicted.This', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'care', 'US', 'Constitution', 'anything', 'so-called', 'founding', 'fathers', 'ostensibly', 'stood', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'not', 'abuse', 'prisons', 'NOT', 'been', 'issue', 'decades', 'anyway', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'regret', 'though', 'docudrama', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'naive', 'assume', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'real', 'footage', 'ideal', 'docudrama', 'good', 'thinking', 'people', 'can', 'challenge', 'credibility', 'testifying', 'Unfortunately', 'given', 'circumstances', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'done.So', 'yes', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'ask', 'What', 'being', 'held', 'were', 'family', 'members', 'relatives', 'How', 'would', 'respond']",N/A
1015396,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000HOL67U,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 7]","Michael Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross' ""The Road to Guantanamo"" employs an interesting narrative style usually called `docu-drama,' unique blend of reality and fiction. The method worked with ""In This World"" an account of two Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. Winterbottom again uses this method in order to re-create the experiences of ""The Tipton Three"" -- Ruhal Ahmed, Shafiq Rasul and Asif Iqbal -- three British Muslins who were caught by the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, and later detained by the US military before they were sent to, and then held in Guantanamo Bay detainment camp for two years.Instead of traditional narrative method with character development, the film opts for more direct approach with fast cutting and grainy semi-documentary images. It has a series of scenes of the harrowing tortures and humiliating abuse inflicted on the three and other detainees. The film is meant to raise anger in the viewers' heart, and its directors Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross are successful in that even if you think that there might be another side to the story.I admit the film's undeniable power and the palpable anger of the directors. However, in spite of them and the inserted footage of the interviews with the real three detainees, the film did not work for me as ""In This World"" several years ago. At some points ""The Road to Guantanamo"" becomes very hazy. Besides the somewhat vague accounts of how and why they went to Afghanistan, the three main characters remain rather bland and interchangeable, almost like ciphers. Or maybe that is the point.""The Road to Guantanamo"" is a very emotional experience to me. After all, it is meant to be so. It is filled with raw energy and power that are remarkable, though I prefer more balanced approach to the subject matter.",3,"Full of Raw Energy and Power, Not Exactly Well-Balanced",1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,1796,"['Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'Mat', 'Whitecross', 'Road', 'Guantanamo', 'interesting', 'narrative', 'style', 'usually', 'called', 'docu-drama', 'unique', 'blend', 'reality', 'fiction', 'method', 'worked', 'World', 'account', 'two', 'Afghan', 'refugees', 'living', 'Pakistan', 'Winterbottom', 'again', 'method', 'order', 're-create', 'experiences', 'Tipton', 'Three', 'Ruhal', 'Ahmed', 'Shafiq', 'Rasul', 'Asif', 'Iqbal', 'three', 'British', 'Muslins', 'who', 'were', 'caught', 'Northern', 'Alliance', 'Afghanistan', 'later', 'detained', 'US', 'military', 'were', 'sent', 'then', 'held', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'detainment', 'camp', 'two', 'years.Instead', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'method', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'opts', 'more', 'direct', 'approach', 'fast', 'cutting', 'grainy', 'semi-documentary', 'images', 'series', 'scenes', 'harrowing', 'tortures', 'humiliating', 'abuse', 'inflicted', 'three', 'other', 'detainees', 'film', 'meant', 'raise', 'anger', 'viewers', 'heart', 'directors', 'Winterbottom', 'Mat', 'Whitecross', 'are', 'successful', 'even', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'side', 'story.I', 'admit', 'film', 'undeniable', 'power', 'palpable', 'anger', 'directors', 'However', 'spite', 'inserted', 'footage', 'interviews', 'real', 'three', 'detainees', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'World', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'points', 'Road', 'Guantanamo', 'very', 'hazy', 'somewhat', 'vague', 'accounts', 'how', 'why', 'went', 'Afghanistan', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'remain', 'rather', 'bland', 'interchangeable', 'almost', 'ciphers', 'maybe', 'point', 'Road', 'Guantanamo', 'very', 'emotional', 'experience', 'meant', 'be', 'so', 'filled', 'raw', 'energy', 'power', 'are', 'remarkable', 'prefer', 'more', 'balanced', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter']",N/A
