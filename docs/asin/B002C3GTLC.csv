1261937,A4U27URFECK1U,B002C3GTLC,"Chris Damon ""Classic TV & Tech Guy""","[1, 1]","I didn't know this show was based on a UK series, but usually the funniest shows are. This show took on a personal side for me. The guy who plays Sam reminded me of a boss named Dan I once had who looked similar to Kyle Borneimer, though not nearly as good looking. He was such a doofus, and had a really stupid sense of humor. Every time I watch this show I just picture him doing all of these stupid things that Sam does and it just makes it ever more funnier. This show never really got much promotion and was always on a sporadic schedule on TV, so not too many people know about it. Kurtwood Smith's role is not that much different than the one in That 70's Show. He is the grumpy dad who always wonders what is going to happen to him next, and it always does thanks to Sam. The wife played by Nancy Lenehan always tries to have faith in Sam to do the right thing, but something always happens to him. Meanwhile his fianc&eacute; Melanie played by Erinn Hayes just can't believe the predicament that Sam always seems to get in.",5,"If you like ""Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers"", etc and ""Father Of The Bride"".
