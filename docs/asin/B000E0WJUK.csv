964782,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000E0WJUK,A Customer,"[5, 5]","Unfolding in three carefully layered separate storylines, Loggerheads is a quietly deceptive movie that demands patience and a sort of intuitive skill from the viewer. Supposedly based on a true story, the tale involves adoption, conservative Christianity, homosexuality and AIDS. Some viewers may be put off by it's somewhat heavy handed approach, but the film is mostly saved by some wonderful performances, particularly by Bonnie Hunt in what is a dramatic departure from her usual comedic roles.In Asheville, North Carolina, middle-aged Grace (Hunt) is back in her briskly managerial mother's (Michael Learned) house after some rough times that included a suicide attempt. Grace is determined to track down the child she gave birth to at 17 and gave up for adoption at mom's insistence. Because adoption records are sealed under the state's laws, she underhandedly hires a private investigator to find him.Meanwhile, miles away in suburban Eden, chirpy and nosy Elizabeth (Tess Harper), feigns normalcy whilst both she and minister husband Robert (Chris Sarandon) strain to ignore the truth behind Marc, their runaway son. Both Elizabeth and Robert are strict religious conservatives, who when they discovered Marc kissing a boy, bought down their entire fire and brimstone wrath upon him.Marc has since vanished and hasn't been heard from since; mention of him is shrouded in taboo and secrecy. Earth-motherly neighbor Rachel (Robin Weigert), however, reveals she knows his whereabouts perhaps allowing for one last chance of reconciliation for Elizabeth. Mark (Kip Pardue) has actually ended up in the coastal town of Kure Beach, for no reason beyond a fascination with the loggerhead turtles that can be seen making their way from shore to sea at night.Local police don't tolerate drifters, but hunky motel owner George, (Michael Kelly) who is mourning the loss of a male partner who drowned mysteriously, offers free lodging to Mark, who confesses that he is H.I.V.-positive. Marc and George develop a melancholy, very hesitant romantic bond; it's an affair that is haunted by the tragedy of their respective pasts.As Marc and George become closer, Mark's anxious spirit hovers over the lives of Elizabeth and Grace.  Caught between maternal love and religious dogma, Elizabeth misses her only son terribly. She just can't come to terms with the fact that her son is gone, yet the issue of his homosexuality just sits too uncomfortably with her husband. When two men and a little boy move into the house across the street, Elizabeth speculates that their new neighbors might be same sex daddies with an adopted son.As Grace, Ms. Hunt As Grace, Ms. Hunt, conveys an agonizing sense of personal incompleteness compounded by years of pent-up shame. She aches to reconnect with her long-lost son, whilst fending off the judgment of her officious mother, who would prefer for Grace to forget it all and just move on.Director Tim Kirkman bathes his movie in a kind-hearted tenderness and melancholy, and you really get the sense that it isn't easy being any of the troubled characters in this movie. The actors are so good that you instantly believe in these characters and really sympathize with them. With overheard radio broadcasts - designating the time period as late in President Clinton's second term or early in George W. Bush's first - are often the only signal the script is jumping around in time, it takes a while to sort out just what is going on and when, and it's a little confusing at first.However, the film eventually comes together and it not just serves as homage to middle-American intolerance and the different layers of maternal guilt and grief, but it has a purity and warmth that underscores the value of taking your time and getting it right.

Loggerheads takes head on: sealed adoption files, the conflicts that erupt in a religious family and a gay son and finds time to have a tender romance blooming under the balmy beach sun.

964792,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000E0WJUK,Grady Harp,"[20, 22]","Loggerheads are turtles, found along the coast of North Carolina, whose lives are unique in that the females always return to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs, hatch their young who in turn by moonlight go out to sea only to return to their origin to repeat the life cycle.  The film by the name LOGGERHEADS relies heavily on this phenomenon: it is set in North Carolina and is guided by the young man Mark (Kip Pardue) who opens the story sleeping on the beach in Kure Beach, NC where he studies and protects the loggerheads.A complex and challenging film, writer/director Tim Kirkman (The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me, Dear Jesse) calls upon a true story to bring up questions of adoption in all the permutations of the triad, homosexuality, religious intolerance, bigotry, AIDS, and the longing for love and forgiveness.  Kirkman sets his story in three years - 1999, 2000, 2001 - a fact that can be disconcerting until the flow of the film reveals the need to separate the events in time.Mark is befriended by George (Michael Kelly) who is a kind young man, owning a motel, and who provides a room for the beach sleeper Mark.  Mark quickly informs George that he has AIDS, thinking that George's kindness is a barter.  But George is a true friend and their relationship grows slowly and with mutual trust as they learn the secrets of their pasts: George's lover 'drowned' in a mysterious accident; Mark ran away from his adoptive parents when they discovered he was gay; both men are tender and vulnerable souls afraid of further commitment.Simultaneously we are introduced to Grace (Bonnie Hunt), recently recovering from a suicide attempt who longs to connect with the son she was forced to give up for adoption at age 17, and who lives with her rather rigid mother Sheridan (Michael Learned) who believes Grace should not try to discover the son she never knew.  We also meet the minister Rev. Robert (Chris Sarandon) and his wife Elizabeth (Tess Harper) who are fanatics about gay people and even resent their neighbor Ruth (Ann Pierce) who places a nude statue of David on her lawn.  The couple's son Mark is never discussed and the adoptive parents never communicate with him - but Ruth does.  Ruth finally confides that Mark is ill and the wounds of separation open for Elizabeth.  Meanwhile Grace has paid a 'finder' to locate Mark but the finder gives her a sad report.  The three years of the story line make exquisite sense at this point as we realize that Kirkman has allowed us to be voyeurs into a human drama of immense substance, one that inexorably binds these disparate characters.The cast is genuinely fine, with Kip Pardue, Michael Kelly, Bonnie Hunt, Tess Harper all giving highly sophisticated performances.  But the credit for the impact of this stunning film goes to the writing and directing of Tim Kirkman.  He has a way with film that is unique: we can only hope he will continue to make films of this quality, films that tackle difficult issues and are molded into realistic, non-manipulated dramas.

The film pulled me in from the start, however, I'm going to have to review the time sequence better (I did find that the only issue that prevented me from giving 5 stars after first watch.) As an adoptee myself, I always find it interesting to see how other men handle the issue. (I have not been interested in finding the birth mother.) The story wreaks of what I think is wrong with the south and this nation at the moment - the religious element is of little use to human kind when used against others.Performances were excellent across the board and I think with the exception of Chris Sarandon's character the others seemed like people I'd like to meet.

You looked so gaunt and yet so streamlined in LOGGERHEADS I had no way of connecting you with the many characters you played in your heyday, except by the agonizing pain in your eyes.  As many reviewers have noticed, you must have been directed with exactly the same strokes as your fellow players Tess Harper and Bonnie Hunt, for all of you constantly wear the same expressions of anguish, as though each had been hit over the head by a giant rubber mallet, so we see nothing but shellshocked pain.  Then I remembered, you were on THE WALTONS.And also I remember you played the part of Marlon Brando's wife in APOCALYPSE NOW and all of your scenes cut before release, which must have been painful for you.  That sort of broken look remained on your beautiful face all throughout LOGGERHEADS, for your character has a lot of guilt to burn off, for she forced her teen daughter to give up a baby and she's never been the same since.I hadn't seen you, Tess Harper OR Bonnie Hunt in years and years, and all of you were just super in the movie.  I guess it's a truism that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with its actresses of a certain age, but happily you all got tangled up in this sophisticated, time travel picture, in which the many different seasons of a cute guy's life get explicated with thousands of close ups of your grief-filled eyes.

964795,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000E0WJUK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 12]","Going into ""Loggerheads"" with much trepidation, I feared another serious film that might preach at me.  It is such an unexpected pleasure these days when a movie allows you to draw your own conclusions--where every emotion isn't telegraphed by big moments.  But the leisurely, and quiet, ""Loggerheads"" is a rarity--a film that is powerful and serious in a very subtle way.The film sets up three concurrent stories, each set one year apart.  In the first story, a young and wandering gay man finds himself in a coastal town studying the lifestyle of the Loggerhead turtles.  Relinquishing the emotional baggage of his past, he learns how to settle into a life in which he's comfortable--even as he is living with HIV.  The second arc, set a year later, deals with a Minister and his wife as they stoically maintain decorum even after their family has split apart.  And lastly, one year after that, a suicidal woman struggles to locate the child she gave up for adoption when she was seventeen.  The stories and timelines interweave expertly, drawing out detailed performances by all.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist, however, to recognize the connectivity of the varying branches--but this film isn't concerned about surprises.  When all is confirmed halfway through the film, it's a satisfying and subtle revelation.The joy of ""Loggerheads"" is in it's genuinely real, and sometimes flawed, characters.  No one here is a villain, but each has made mistakes.  What is unorthodox, however, is that each person is trying to do right--is trying to live their life as best they can.  Kip Pardue has his best role yet as the young man, and his tentative connection with an effective Michael Kelly is believable and refreshing.  Tess Harper, as the Minister's wife, keeps her pain and suffering just beneath the surface as she seeks to understand how events have left her where she is.  And Bonnie Hunt, searching for the child she gave up, is a revelation.  Her performance makes you wish she'd take on serious work more often.Quiet and understated in every way, ""Loggerheads"" does something quite unique.  Every big moment, every bit of melodrama, confrontation, or revelation is done off screen.  This is not about big ""actorly"" grandstanding--which in less assured hands, it might have been.  It's about the smaller moments that characterize how people deal with their lives in an everyday sense.  To be sure, the issues dealt with here are very serious, but the film never gets lost in messages or contrivance.  No, it's a very observant picture highlighting real characters dealing with the repercussions of the choices and the mistakes that they've made.  Where others films might have chosen to sentimentalize this story, ""Loggerheads"" presents things matter-of-factly.  Allowing you to draw your own conclusions, it has great dignity and restraint--and, thus, reaches a moving conclusion that elicits genuinely earned emotion.""Loggerheads"" was a pleasant surprise in every sense.  Serious, sweet, and sad--the film is real, meaningful, and effective.  A near perfect, fantastically understated treat--this intelligent film earns 4 1/2 stars from me.

It is not entirely a gay movie but it does seem to be a common theme throughout as there are three different things happening.Grace Bellamy (Hunt) is living with her mother.  After a failed suicide, she decides to find a boy that she had given up for adoption when she was 17.  While dealing with issues with her mother, Grace hires some sort of a private investigator to find information on her son.Robert and Elizabeth live in a quiet family neighborhood in North Carolina.  Robert is a reverend and spends most of his time at his church.  Elizabeth is one of those nosy ladies that constantly check through the window on the neighbors.  Things are happening that she feels the neighbors will complain when it is just her. There's a couple of things going on that is keeping Elizabeth busy.  First, she believes that a gay couple, with a kid, has moved in across the street.  Secondly, another neighbor has put up a nude statue of David in the front yard.  The reverend urges her to invite them to church and to convince a neighbor to take down the statue.George runs a motel at Kure Beach.  He's gay and everyone in this little town knows it and do not make it a big deal.  Mark is a newcomer.  He comes to check up on the loggerhead turtles, since they are endangered.  George and Mark strike up a friendship, which Mark confides that he is HIV-positive.  While Mark is used to bartering with sex, George shows him that there's more to life and friendship than sex bartering.*Loggerheads* is just simply a wonderful film that's low-key in drama and dialogues.  And it works!  It couldn't have been done better than to film it in North Carolina, where everything fits.

964797,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000E0WJUK,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","Tim Kirkman is a gay filmmaker whose first documentary was ""Dear Jesse"" about North Carolina's Senator Jesse Helms.  His second film was a gay feature ""The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me"" about AIDS.  This film is about more than just the one story line of a gay man who likes turtles.Bonnie Hunt who was nominated for two Golden Globes for ""Life With Bonnie,"" a sitcom that actually made me laugh, and debuted in ""Rainman"" as a waitress, plays a dramatic role as Grace Bellamy, a woman who regrets having given up her baby for adoption and longs to know what happened to him.  The issue of adoption brought to mind the filmBellathat is also very beautiful.Michael Learned who will probably always remembered for ""The Waltons"" for which she received numerous Golden Globe nominations plays Grace's mother Sheridan who forced the decision on her teenage daughter.  While Sheridan acted in what she thought was best for her daughter's future, we still regard her as heavy-handed as life sometimes takes us in unexpected directions.Kip Pardue was in ""Remember the Titans"" with Denzel Washington, ""Driven"" with Sylvester Stallone"" and starred in a smaller feature ""South of Pico"" last year.  His reddish blond hair and blue eyes give him a Redford-like leading man look.  As Mark, he plays a young man suffering from AIDS, having left a rigidly religious household that could not accept him as gay.  Pardue does a good job, but Kirkman doesn't elicit a deep performance from him.  Rather than the seeing the conflicts of knowing that life will be short, we see a nice young man having adventures as he roams about.Ironically, Chris Sarandon -- who was formerly the husband of Susan -- earned his lone Oscar nomination for 1975's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" where he played a transsexual opposite Al Pacino.  In this film he plays ""Reverend Robert Austin"" who is a hell, fire & brimstone preacher who watches his family fall apart and refuses to save it because of his religious convictions.  This brought to mind another excellent small film I saw recently calledForgiving the Franklins, also Carolina-based as is ""Loggerheads"" at Kure Beach.Tess Harper whose Oscar nomination came for ""Crimes of the Heart"" in 1986 looks matronly as Mark's adoptive mother Elizabeth.  The scene at the conclusion of the film with the biological mother Grace and the adoptive mother sharing memories of their shared son is very touching.Michael Kelly gives an excellent performance as George.  Kelly became known in ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 2004 and also appeared in ""Carlito's Way.""  As the gay motel owner, his performance is deep and touching as we see his grief over his departed partner, the compassion with which he treats other people and his moral stance that rejects Mark's misinterpretation that his kindness is offered as barter for physical attention.  It is a well-written and excellently portrayed performance.Valerie Watkins turns in a nice cameo performance as Lola/Sharon who also stays and works at the motel.  I found this film touching.  The conclusion left a bit to be connected by the viewer, which may be a result of the editing.  However, ""Loggerheads"" is an excellent small film.  I enjoyed watching Bonnie Hunt's and Kip Pardue's comments on the DVD extras.

But it was quite the opposite and I was quite wrong - instead, I found a wonderful work of art that was so genuine and full of the realistic subtleties of life.  It was totally captivating and had such heart!  I cared about the characters and their often flawed, yet deeply felt emotional responses to the great challenges in their lives.  I can't believe I knew nothing of this film until a few months ago.  I don't remember its theatrical release at all!  It just makes me wonder how so many terrible films can make their way into theatres, while little gems like LOGGERHEADS disappear into oblivion.

964801,A14794N044AML4,B000E0WJUK,"Rolando A. Perez ""RAP""","[4, 4]","This is a Strand Releasing movie dealing with the unfortunate and serious issues of being gay and the AIDS virus. Beautiful Kip Purdue (Remember the Titans) plays Mark, an environmentalist who is interested in loggerhead turtles on the shores of North Carolina, he has also runaway from home when he was a teenager, because he got caught kissing another boy and being gay, and his parents not approving of his behavior.  He is dying due to the AIDS virus, which is really not explored in the movie, it is more of a circumstance to further develop the story line. This movie is apparently based on a true story. And it is told in a different periods of time, this is subtle, and you don't realize it until the end of the movie.Mark is an adopted child, whose parents are devout, religious people (his father is a minister.) He meets George, a motel owner, in the sleepy seaside town of Kure Beach, North Carolina. Mark is sleeping on the beach while watching loggerhead turtles. George, Michael Kelly, is also gay. George takes him in, and their relationship flourish. George is a widower (his previous partner dies of an accidental drowning). George was hesitant to get romantically involved with Mark, but he finally gives in and lives with him until his death. Again this is not apparent in the movie but you deduce that is what happens.George is in contact with Mark's grandmother who tells her his whereabouts and condition. She in turns tells her daughter Pattie (Mark's mother.) Robert, Chris Sarandon, Marc's father does not want to forgive him. In the meantime, Grace, Bonnie Hunt, Mark's biological mother, is looking for Mark. She finds him through an orphaned advocate who believes in re-uniting birth parents with adopted children for a fee. At the end of the movie she talks to the adopted mother and George (again this the subtlety of time differences.)The movie outlines the lives of all these characters, all connected to Mark. Because the movie plot occurs in separate times, you have pay close attention to what is happening. There is obvious tones of negative judging about acceptance and being gay throughout the movie. The movie is matured, well crafted, directed, and produced, it is designed as a novel. There is an excellent cast with some old powerful actors. Probably the movie will not be embrace by all age groups.",4,Drama,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,2342,"['Strand', 'Releasing', 'movie', 'dealing', 'unfortunate', 'serious', 'issues', 'being', 'gay', 'AIDS', 'virus', 'Beautiful', 'Kip', 'Purdue', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Mark', 'environmentalist', 'who', 'interested', 'loggerhead', 'turtles', 'shores', 'North', 'Carolina', 'also', 'runaway', 'home', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'got', 'caught', 'kissing', 'boy', 'being', 'gay', 'parents', 'not', 'approving', 'behavior', 'dying', 'due', 'AIDS', 'virus', 'really', 'not', 'explored', 'movie', 'more', 'circumstance', 'further', 'develop', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'apparently', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'different', 'periods', 'time', 'subtle', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'end', 'movie.Mark', 'adopted', 'child', 'parents', 'are', 'devout', 'religious', 'people', 'father', 'minister', 'George', 'motel', 'owner', 'sleepy', 'seaside', 'town', 'Kure', 'Beach', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Mark', 'sleeping', 'beach', 'watching', 'loggerhead', 'turtles', 'George', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'also', 'gay', 'George', 'relationship', 'flourish', 'George', 'widower', 'previous', 'partner', 'dies', 'accidental', 'drowning', 'George', 'was', 'hesitant', 'get', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Mark', 'finally', 'lives', 'death', 'Again', 'not', 'apparent', 'movie', 'deduce', 'what', 'happens.George', 'contact', 'Mark', 'grandmother', 'who', 'whereabouts', 'condition', 'turns', 'tells', 'daughter', 'Pattie', 'Mark', 'mother', 'Robert', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'Marc', 'father', 'not', 'want', 'forgive', 'meantime', 'Grace', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'Mark', 'biological', 'mother', 'looking', 'Mark', 'orphaned', 'advocate', 'who', 're-uniting', 'birth', 'parents', 'adopted', 'children', 'fee', 'end', 'movie', 'adopted', 'mother', 'George', 'again', 'subtlety', 'time', 'differences', 'movie', 'lives', 'characters', 'all', 'connected', 'Mark', 'movie', 'plot', 'separate', 'times', 'have', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'what', 'happening', 'obvious', 'tones', 'negative', 'judging', 'acceptance', 'being', 'gay', 'movie', 'movie', 'matured', 'well', 'crafted', 'directed', 'produced', 'designed', 'novel', 'excellent', 'cast', 'old', 'powerful', 'actors', 'Probably', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'embrace', 'age', 'groups']",Loggerheads

964803,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B000E0WJUK,Turfseer,"[1, 3]","At the beginning of 'Loggerheads', we're introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters. To make matters even more confusing, we're informed (via titles on the screen) that the action is taking place in three separate time lines (between the years 1999 and 2001). It takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three pairs are related: Mark Austin, a young man in his 20s, gay and HIV Positive is estranged from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin.Mark is now a drifter and arrives in Kure Beach, North Carolina, a seaside town, where he meets George (sensitively played by Michael Kelly), a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other. Meanwhile, Mark's birth mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt) has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was 17. Similarly, Mark's adoptive mother, also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him (despite the misgivings of her homophobic minister husband).'Loggerheads' we're told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its Achilles Heel. Director/Writer Tim Kirkman tries too hard to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found. Take Mark and George--they're both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about. There's some slight tension when Grace faces off against an Adoption Agency Director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager. No sparks fly either between Elizabeth and Robert since the good Reverend has adamantly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son.'Loggerheads' is similar to 'Brokeback Mountain' in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males (for example, the Kure Beach cop and the Reverend) are the baddies. The biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction (and hence no dramatic conflict) between Mark and either one of his 'mothers'. Mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him.Kirkman's theme is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it's too late! Kirkman's sentiments are for the most part well-intentioned but they do not make for good drama. Loggerheads moves along at a snail's pace without providing any new revelations (or suspense) regarding such topics as AIDS, Adoption and Homophobia. Ultimately 'Loggerheads' fails due to a lack of originality.",2,Slow-paced like a turtle!,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,2677,"['beginning', ""'Loggerheads"", ""'re"", 'introduced', 'three', 'pairs', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'characters', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', ""'re"", 'informed', 'titles', 'screen', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'three', 'separate', 'time', 'lines', 'years', '1999', '2001', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'eventually', 'come', 'see', 'how', 'three', 'pairs', 'are', 'related', 'Mark', 'Austin', 'young', 'man', '20s', 'gay', 'HIV', 'Positive', 'estranged', 'conservative', 'parents', 'Elizabeth', 'Rev', 'Robert', 'Austin.Mark', 'now', 'drifter', 'Kure', 'Beach', 'North', 'Carolina', 'seaside', 'town', 'where', 'George', 'sensitively', 'played', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'gay', 'motel', 'owner', 'eventually', 'become', 'involved', 'other', 'Meanwhile', 'Mark', 'birth', 'mother', 'Grace', 'played', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'come', 'point', 'life', 'where', 'decided', 'find', 'son', 'gave', 'up', 'adoption', 'when', 'was', '17', 'Similarly', 'Mark', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'also', 'decided', 'track', 'estranged', 'son', 'misgivings', 'homophobic', 'minister', 'husband', ""'Loggerheads"", ""'re"", 'told', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'perhaps', 'Achilles', 'Heel', 'Director/Writer', 'Tim', 'Kirkman', 'too', 'hard', 'create', 'scenes', 'fraught', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'where', 'very', 'little', 'be', 'found', 'Take', 'Mark', 'George', ""'re"", 'sensitive', 'souls', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'disagree', 'about', 'slight', 'tension', 'when', 'Grace', 'off', 'Adoption', 'Agency', 'Director', 'who', 'forbidden', 'law', 'give', 'information', 'lost', 'son', 'as', 'well', 'slight', 'conflict', 'mother', 'who', 'disapproved', 'when', 'became', 'pregnant', 'teenager', 'sparks', 'fly', 'Elizabeth', 'Robert', 'good', 'Reverend', 'adamantly', 'insisted', 'beginning', 'intention', 'reconciling', 'son', ""'Loggerheads"", 'similar', ""'Brokeback"", 'Mountain', 'gay', 'couple', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'straight', 'males', 'example', 'Kure', 'Beach', 'cop', 'Reverend', 'are', 'baddies', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'movie', 'interaction', 'hence', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'Mark', 'one', ""'mothers"", 'Mark', 'already', 'dead', 'birth', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'chance', 'reconcile', 'him.Kirkman', 'theme', 'plea', 'tolerance', 'exhortation', 'family', 'members', 'express', 'heartfelt', 'feelings', 'too', 'late', 'Kirkman', 'sentiments', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'well-intentioned', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'drama', 'Loggerheads', 'along', 'snail', 'pace', 'providing', 'new', 'revelations', 'suspense', 'regarding', 'such', 'topics', 'AIDS', 'Adoption', 'Homophobia', 'Ultimately', 'fails', 'due', 'lack', 'originality']",Loggerheads
