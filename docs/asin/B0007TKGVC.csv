For someone who has never watched Survivor or who has never been into reality t.v. this is a FANTASTIC introduction.  This show captivated America's hearts more than any other season.  The cast was so diverse, we have Elisabeth Filarski (now Hasslebeck from The View) who is one of the ultimate Survivor heroes and truly and inspiration.  Right next to her we have Colby Donaldson, one of the most iconic players of all time.  We have the loveable Kentucky Joe-Rodger Bingham, Tina Wesson is one of the most underrated players in all of Survivor, Jerri Manthey the ultimate female Villain the show has ever seen.  The cast was just spectacular, there was so much raw human emotion throughout this season.  There is the biggest injury in the history of the show, a flood, ultimate starvation, and more!  I can't explain how connected I felt to these people after watching them on TV.  They were just incredible.If you are on the fence about buying this, buy it.  You will not regret it.

889215,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0007TKGVC,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[35, 39]","I was never a fan of reality television, and to this day only watch two reality shows, Survivor being one of them. Thus, I watched only one episode of The Australian Outback when it was on television. The first contestant voted off, Debb Eaton, lived in the next town over from where I grew up, so I tuned in to see how she did and after that, didn't tune back.And now after watching this fantastic DVD set, I am disappointed I didn't keep watching. While I have seen only the three most recent seasons (All-Stars, Vanuatu and Palau) plus the DVD of the first season, I can understand why people who are big fans of this series consistently rank Survivor Australia as one of the best seasons ever. The perfect mix of people in a great environment led to a truly captivating series.The second season provided some very memorable moments, moments that can probably be included among the very best in Survivor history. Of course there is the famous beef jerky incident where ""aspiring actress"" and resident evil woman Jerri Manthey accuses Army officer Kel Gleason of smuggling beef jerky. Who wasn't thrilled for farmer-schoolteacher Rodger ""Kentucky Joe"" Bingham when he confronted his fear of heights and  his lack of swimming ability by leaping off a huge cliff into the water below? I am sure everyone was happy for gourmet (yes I think he can cook rice) chef Keith Famie when  he proposed to his girlfriend in a quick internet chat from the Outback and she said yes. His emotion was genuine as he grabbed Jeff Probst and hugged him. Of course, the incredible relationship between Kentucky Joe and young footwear designer Elisabeth Filarski was a unique one, but one that kept them together until the last few days. Jerri's flirting with Colby Donaldson was amazingly pathetic, and it was actually funny to watch him as you knew he wasn't even remotely interested. And who can forget Michael Skupin's fall in the fire, the one move that essentially changed the game.Of course, when Colby, the auto customizer from Texas, chose Tennessee mom Tina Wesson to join him in the final two, he assured he would finish second, but knew that Tina would be a deserving winner. This was a great moment in Survivor history, as a player put his friendship and alliance ahead of his own personal game. Not until Ian in Pulau did we see something quite like that again. It was a good move and Colby came out, although not with a million dollars, looking like the good guy.Throw in some great characters, such as Maralyn ""Mad Dog"" Hershey, the retired cop from Virginia, Amber Brkich, the youngest of the group, who would go on to win the All-Stars edition, yet who in this edition was quite tentative, but hung tough, the conniving Jeff Varner who would start a battle between others and watch it brew, trainer Alicia Callaway and her finger-waving, and vegetarian Kimmi Kappenberg, the butt of much of Alicia's finger waves and you have the makings of a great season.By comparison to the seasons now, these Survivors were given a lot to help their survival and the challenges weren't quite as difficult as the ones we have seen in the past few years, but they were still quite entertaining and it was great to see the original challenges that some of the newer seasons have used, or built off of.The story of the season early on was the domination of Kucha at the challenges. They had Ogakor feeling down and depressed and it looked like, heading into the merge, that Kucha would have the numbers to just pick off Ogakor one-by-one. Then came Michael's fall in the fire. When he was airlifted out of the game, Kucha lost their advantage and the planning by Ogakor came into play and they were successful, as the final three were all members of the original Ogakor. In the end, it was Colby's domination that helped to push him to the finals, where he chose Tina to sit next to him and the rest is history.There is a reason that five of these castaways (Alicia, Colby, Tina, Amber, Jerri) were chosen to participate in the All-Star version. This group of people was one of the finest casts assembled and the dynamics that came into play really made this season a joy to watch.And of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Elisabeth one more time. In the first season, the incredibly beautiful Colleen Haskell became ""America's Sweetheart."" In this season, the incredibly cute Elisabeth took over that role. Her relationship with Rodger gave her a very real feel, and to anyone watching, she felt like she would be someone you would be friends with in the outside world.The bonus features on this disc are very solid. There are six different commentary tracks, with two from Alicia, Kimmi and Michael (including the one where he falls in the fire), two from Keith, Rodger, Amber and Tina and two from Colby and Jeff Probst, who really began defining the role of realilty show host in this season. To this day, there is nobody who has that role down as well as he does. The two with Colby and Jeff are really, really good, while the others are very good and insightful. There are a couple of documentaries as well and the mid-season recap episode is included. Also included in the set is the previously released ""Greatest and Most Outrageous Moments"" which among other things features little bits on every Survivor and their time in the Outback.On a personal note, I was watching that bonus disc and during the spot on Debb, they showed her sitting on her motorcycle on my mother's front lawn, which happens to be right next to a covered bridge. It was pretty funny to see and took me by surprise.So whether you've been a fan of the show since day one, or it something you are learning to like, this set is top-notch. You will not be disappointed. Now let's hope they consider releasing more season sets.",5,"42 Days, 16 people . . .

I also liked Kimmi. Mike said that Kimmi had a dirt line instead of a tan line. One of the saddest moments in Survivor history was in Ep:6 when Mike fell into the fire and had to leave the game. On the other tribe (Ogakor) I wanted Tina or Marylin to make it far. I also thought that Colby was cool too.

This is the season that really hooked me as a fan and has kept me watching to this day...even through some less than stellar seasons.  Coming off the hot heels of the enormously successful Borneo; Survivor matured and solidified itself in Australia becoming one of the defining Reality Shows of all time.I remember this season as being so huge that I had to listen to every radio/TV talk show and commentary. I rooted for Colby, sympathized with Roger, and was glued to the set. I even became addicted to the website. I still have my ""Survivor II Field Guide"" with map and tribe bios.  I was truly a Survivor junky and I didn't think I would be.  I have to add that Jeff Probst excellent hosting skills were a big part of that.I think the other positive reviews have really expressed the same things I feel but I have to say that for fans of Survivor to get the feeling this season had for us, you have to remember how caught up we all were in this show in the Spring of 01.  I'm not sure if any season since has really captured the drama that prevailed during Australia or held the media's attention.  I wish there could have been more. (I did later become an advent Rupert fan.)Best moment:  The rainstorm that devastated the camp and had them scrambling out over a raging river for their last tin of rice.  Oh, and Jeff scolding them for their bad rationing practices.Additional Comment:Finally got the video and it lives up to my expectations. Fantastic and all the extras you can shake a Didjeridu at!!

889224,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0007TKGVC,Paul Allaer,"[0, 0]","Only weeks ago, I purchased and watched Season 1 of Survivor, which was the only season I had never seen. Indeed, I became a fan of Survivor when Season 2 first aired in Spring, 2001, and I have been watching every season since then. At the conclusion of watching Season 1, nostalgia and curiosity got the better of me and so I decided to watch Season 2 again, 12+ years after having seen it unfold on TV week after week.Having now seen ""Survivor - The Australian Outback: The Complete Second Season"" (6 DVDs), I can state unequivocally that Season 2 of Survivor remains the standard bearer and indeed is the VERY BEST season of Survivor, and unlikely to be ever surpassed for that matter. Several reasons for that: first and foremost, this is by far the strongest cast of Survivor players, and by that I don't necessarily mean they played the game better than in other seasons, but most of them were simply interesting and/or appealing and/or devisive people. The names have been mentioned in plenty of other reviews here, so no need to rehash them again, but there is a reason why so many got called up to play in subsequent All-Stars/Fan Favorites seasons! Second, Season 2 still retains the 'innocense' of Season 1 when it comes to strategizing and ""playing"" the game (and each other). Yes, the contestants are aware that a game is being played, but there is very little scheming or backstabbing going on. The best example: when they are down to 5 people, it is clear that Rodger and Elizabeth are next to go, and that Keith is the third wheel to the Colby-Tina tandem. yet not a single one of Rodger/Elizabeth/Keith contemplates making any move whatsoever to reverse their fortunes. Third, the element of ""surviving"" is still very much an essential component to the show, as we see one tough weather challenge or nature setback after another (camp washed away, no food, etc.).It frankly surprised me to see how entertaining it was to re-watch this. I had forgotten quite a bit of the details 12 years later, and spending time with these characters was a very easy thing to do. When you contrast Season 2 with the most recent seasons, it is amazing how much the show has evolved, and sadly not always for the better. If you want to experience Survivor at the peak of its game, do yourself a favor and (re)watch ""The Australian Outback"" season from start to finish.

889229,AP3B615GM191G,B0007TKGVC,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","After the incredible success of the first ""Survivor"" installment, the challenge for show creator Mark Burnett was to concoct a repeat performance.  Though markedly different from the original, ""The Australian Outback"" again succeeds wildly due to a set of different factors that ultimately set the show up for a long, long run.Whereas the first season was all about alliances, backstabbing, and societal/philosophical issues, Season Two was just more fun.  Some examples include:-Kimmi, the spoiled vegetarian-Jerri, the ""b-word"" everyone loved to hate-Elisabeth and Amber, ""America's Sweethearts""-Colby playing the game with integrity-Michael killing a boar but ultimately meeting a tragic exit from the competitionBasically, this season showed two key ""truths"" of Survivor that the first season did not touch on very much (if at all):1. Solid, positive relationships could indeed be formed between the castaways.2. The physical aspect of the game (actually surviving on little food and unpredictable weather) is nothing to sneeze at.I consider the first two Survivor seasons to have really set the bedrock for the show that may not ever actually end (25 seasons and counting now!).  Though my viewing dropped off after about season four (I felt as if the ""freshness"" was gone), I will always appreciate and enjoy the impact ""Survivor: Australia"" had on the franchise.",5,Survivor's Staying Power,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,1369,"['incredible', 'success', 'first', 'Survivor', 'installment', 'challenge', 'show', 'creator', 'Mark', 'Burnett', 'was', 'concoct', 'repeat', 'performance', 'markedly', 'different', 'original', 'Australian', 'Outback', 'again', 'wildly', 'due', 'set', 'different', 'factors', 'ultimately', 'set', 'show', 'up', 'long', 'long', 'run.Whereas', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'alliances', 'backstabbing', 'societal/philosophical', 'issues', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'fun', 'examples', 'include', '-Kimmi', 'spoiled', 'vegetarian-Jerri', 'b-word', 'everyone', 'loved', 'hate-Elisabeth', 'Amber', 'America', 'Sweethearts', '-Colby', 'playing', 'game', 'integrity-Michael', 'killing', 'boar', 'ultimately', 'meeting', 'tragic', 'exit', 'competitionBasically', 'season', 'showed', 'two', 'key', 'truths', 'Survivor', 'first', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'touch', 'very', 'much', ':1', 'Solid', 'positive', 'relationships', 'could', 'indeed', 'be', 'formed', 'castaways.2', 'physical', 'aspect', 'game', 'actually', 'surviving', 'little', 'food', 'unpredictable', 'weather', 'nothing', 'sneeze', 'at.I', 'consider', 'first', 'two', 'Survivor', 'seasons', 'have', 'really', 'set', 'bedrock', 'show', 'may', 'not', 'ever', 'actually', 'end', '25', 'seasons', 'counting', 'now', 'viewing', 'dropped', 'off', 'season', 'four', 'felt', 'freshness', 'was', 'gone', 'will', 'always', 'appreciate', 'enjoy', 'impact', 'Survivor', 'Australia', 'had', 'franchise']",N/A
