Delaspozas ""Alicia""","[0, 0]","Verdi: La Traviata - Los Angeles Opera Orchestra & Chorus [Blu-ray]I like to have different versions of the same opera when I like it and La Traviata is one of them. I read the reviews of this DVD and I decided to buy it and knowing the main characters from other performances I knew that it was going to be great.I always enjoyed how this romantic story take place in this master piece with the beautiful music that it can be hear over and over, even though it has a tragic ending, it is impossible to renounce enjoying it.The cast is outstanding: Renee Fleming as Violeta was very good, her singing as well as her acting, she shows how the character has to fight against her illness and her love for Alfredo, she has to renounce her happiness and put aside her feelings because the society represented by Alfredo's father does not accept her because of her reputation could harm his family.Alfredo played by Rolando Villazon was very convincing in his role as Violeta's lover; it is a shame that he can't continue singing any more. He is a very good singer and actor.Germont played by Renato Bruson was very good in his role showing his transformation toward Violeta as he changes his opinion of her.The rest of the cast ,scenery, costumes and of course the direction were excellent.Any one who likes La Traviata and are Renee Fleming and Rolando Villazon fans should buy this DVD.",5,A very good performance,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,1383,"['Verdi', 'La', 'Traviata', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Opera', 'Orchestra', 'Chorus', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'like', 'have', 'different', 'versions', 'same', 'opera', 'when', 'like', 'La', 'Traviata', 'one', 'read', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'decided', 'buy', 'knowing', 'main', 'characters', 'other', 'performances', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great.I', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'romantic', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'master', 'piece', 'beautiful', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'hear', 'even', 'tragic', 'ending', 'impossible', 'renounce', 'enjoying', 'it.The', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'Renee', 'Fleming', 'Violeta', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'singing', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'how', 'character', 'fight', 'illness', 'love', 'Alfredo', 'renounce', 'happiness', 'put', 'aside', 'feelings', 'society', 'represented', 'Alfredo', 'father', 'not', 'accept', 'reputation', 'could', 'harm', 'family.Alfredo', 'played', 'Rolando', 'Villazon', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'Violeta', 'lover', 'shame', 'ca', ""n't"", 'continue', 'singing', 'more', 'very', 'good', 'singer', 'actor.Germont', 'played', 'Renato', 'Bruson', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'showing', 'transformation', 'Violeta', 'opinion', 'her.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'course', 'direction', 'were', 'excellent.Any', 'one', 'who', 'La', 'Traviata', 'are', 'Renee', 'Fleming', 'Rolando', 'Villazon', 'fans', 'should', 'buy', 'DVD']",Verdi: La Traviata - Los Angeles Opera Orchestra & Chorus
1217294,AYDW2AFFLN2QH,B001MRMRSS,"Cy Reese ""screenwriter""","[4, 5]","By now, I think I own all or nearly all of the filmed Traviatas, and would someday like to say that I have the definitive production in my collection. Alas, after viewing this Los Angeles Opera production, I have to admit that my search must go on, BUT, this production came close.  First of all, it was a traditional staging, which does not appeal to those who want their operas to be like Startrek - ""to go where no one has gone before"".  To that mind-set, the Willie Decker production starring Villazon and Netrebko is more appealing.  This reviewer has seen so many failures - ""Euro Trash"" - that I prefer traditional, thank you. What makes this production outstanding is the fine singing by the protagonists.  All of the principals are very believable in their roles, not only because they can act and emote, but because they look the ages they represent on stage.  Yes, Fleming is older than Villazon, but did anyone notice?  She is eternally young when she sings and can justifiably claim to be the top American soprano of this age.  Bravo Villazon!  Along with the ""new breed"" of tenors - Juan Diego Florez, Jonas Kaufmann, and Ramon Vargas to name a few - Villazon gives us opera lovers optimism that all is well in tenor world despite the passing of Pavarotti, the vocal decline of Carreras, and the thickening of Domingo's tenor voice to the point that he thinks it necessary to assume baritone roles. The Los Angeles Opera Orchestra conducted by James Conlin created glorious music superbly recorded by Decca in the bluray disc, which also makes the viewer appreciate all the more the period stage sets.  So, why is this one not the definitive production?  I can not put my finger on it!  Perhaps it's because I prefer, like all romantics and knights, to be on the quest.  But again, this Traviata came close to ending my quest and I highly recommend it to lovers of great opera and Giuseppe Verdi's music.",5,"Not the definitive Traviata, but it comes close",1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1918,"['now', 'think', 'own', 'nearly', 'filmed', 'Traviatas', 'would', 'someday', 'say', 'have', 'definitive', 'production', 'collection', 'Alas', 'viewing', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Opera', 'production', 'have', 'admit', 'search', 'must', 'go', 'BUT', 'production', 'came', 'close', 'First', 'all', 'was', 'traditional', 'staging', 'not', 'appeal', 'who', 'want', 'operas', 'be', 'Startrek', 'go', 'where', 'one', 'gone', 'before', 'mind-set', 'Willie', 'Decker', 'production', 'starring', 'Villazon', 'Netrebko', 'more', 'appealing', 'reviewer', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'failures', 'Euro', 'Trash', 'prefer', 'traditional', 'thank', 'What', 'production', 'outstanding', 'fine', 'singing', 'protagonists', 'principals', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'roles', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'act', 'emote', 'look', 'ages', 'represent', 'stage', 'Yes', 'Fleming', 'older', 'Villazon', 'did', 'anyone', 'notice', 'eternally', 'young', 'when', 'sings', 'can', 'justifiably', 'claim', 'be', 'top', 'American', 'soprano', 'age', 'Bravo', 'Villazon', 'new', 'breed', 'tenors', 'Juan', 'Diego', 'Florez', 'Jonas', 'Kaufmann', 'Ramon', 'Vargas', 'name', 'few', 'Villazon', 'lovers', 'optimism', 'well', 'tenor', 'world', 'passing', 'Pavarotti', 'vocal', 'decline', 'Carreras', 'thickening', 'Domingo', 'tenor', 'voice', 'point', 'necessary', 'assume', 'baritone', 'roles', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Opera', 'Orchestra', 'conducted', 'James', 'Conlin', 'created', 'glorious', 'music', 'superbly', 'recorded', 'Decca', 'bluray', 'disc', 'also', 'viewer', 'appreciate', 'more', 'period', 'stage', 'sets', 'So', 'why', 'one', 'not', 'definitive', 'production', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'finger', 'Perhaps', 'prefer', 'romantics', 'knights', 'be', 'quest', 'again', 'Traviata', 'came', 'close', 'ending', 'quest', 'highly', 'recommend', 'lovers', 'great', 'opera', 'Giuseppe', 'Verdi', 'music']",Verdi: La Traviata - Los Angeles Opera Orchestra & Chorus
1217295,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B001MRMRSS,I. Giles,"[1, 1]","This is fine new performance and recording of a favourite opera and one that is closely associated with Fleming. Bearing that in mind, supporters of Fleming now have two fine versions to choose from and both on either DVD or Blu-ray too. I personally prefer the English production at the Royal Opera to this somewhat more spectacular American version on grounds of preferring the rather more intimate setting of the Royal Opera production and the lead tenor who I find to deliver a more balanced partner to Fleming. He is a little more self-controlled than Villazon in this rival American production whom I find rather overblown for my taste. However there will be many who disagree and would choose this alternative version featuring Fleming. Both are rewarding in their own ways and will give much pleasure whichever is chosen.However, my favourite versions of this wonderful opera/drama are still those featuring Gheorghiu who is uniquely able to be the part and to not simply act the role. For some time this my favourite has been her older DVD version with Solti which was her d&eacute;but stunner in London. Now finally there is a true challenger to that performance - and yet again it is Gheorghiu! This time she is older and it shows! The gains are a deeper awareness of the entire dramatic situation, but seen through an older, more experienced woman's eyes. The loss relates to the earlier version being that of a simply younger and fresher woman at the start of her career as you might expect, but bringing a personal level of understanding that you would not expect. Hence its long term standing as a benchmark event.The imaging is crisp in typical HD fashion with full colour and involving camera work. The sound is presented in high quality surround and stereo formats.Which to choose? There is only one answer to this dilemma - and that is to buy both Gheorghiu performances for contrasting and complementary experiences delivered by an artist who really seems to live the part rather than acting it. These could be supplemented by either of the fine, some would say preferable, performances and productions featuring Fleming. We are really spoilt for choice here!In summary therefore, regardless of my preference for the Gheorghiu performances I have still found this performance to be rewarding in terms of both musical values and recording values, sound and vision combined. The Blu-ray version brings all the advantages of the expected additional recorded clarity at all levels and would be my primary recommendation although my previous DVD was still very good. For me it is a 4 star issue but supporters of these artists in particular would probably rate it at 5 stars.",4,4 stars for my taste but many would rate this as 5 stars and I would not argue!,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,2690,"['fine', 'new', 'performance', 'recording', 'favourite', 'opera', 'one', 'closely', 'associated', 'Fleming', 'Bearing', 'mind', 'supporters', 'Fleming', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'fine', 'versions', 'choose', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'too', 'personally', 'prefer', 'English', 'production', 'Royal', 'Opera', 'somewhat', 'more', 'spectacular', 'American', 'version', 'grounds', 'preferring', 'rather', 'more', 'intimate', 'setting', 'Royal', 'Opera', 'production', 'lead', 'tenor', 'who', 'find', 'deliver', 'more', 'balanced', 'partner', 'Fleming', 'little', 'more', 'self-controlled', 'Villazon', 'rival', 'American', 'production', 'whom', 'find', 'rather', 'overblown', 'taste', 'However', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'who', 'disagree', 'would', 'choose', 'alternative', 'version', 'featuring', 'Fleming', 'are', 'rewarding', 'own', 'ways', 'will', 'give', 'much', 'pleasure', 'whichever', 'chosen.However', 'favourite', 'versions', 'wonderful', 'opera/drama', 'are', 'still', 'featuring', 'Gheorghiu', 'who', 'uniquely', 'able', 'be', 'part', 'not', 'simply', 'act', 'role', 'time', 'favourite', 'been', 'older', 'DVD', 'version', 'Solti', 'was', 'd', 'eacute', 'stunner', 'London', 'Now', 'finally', 'true', 'challenger', 'performance', 'yet', 'again', 'Gheorghiu', 'time', 'older', 'gains', 'are', 'deeper', 'awareness', 'entire', 'dramatic', 'situation', 'seen', 'older', 'more', 'experienced', 'woman', 'eyes', 'loss', 'earlier', 'version', 'being', 'simply', 'younger', 'fresher', 'woman', 'start', 'career', 'might', 'expect', 'bringing', 'personal', 'level', 'understanding', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'Hence', 'long', 'term', 'standing', 'benchmark', 'event.The', 'imaging', 'crisp', 'typical', 'HD', 'fashion', 'full', 'colour', 'involving', 'camera', 'work', 'sound', 'presented', 'high', 'quality', 'surround', 'stereo', 'formats.Which', 'choose', 'only', 'one', 'answer', 'dilemma', 'buy', 'Gheorghiu', 'performances', 'contrasting', 'complementary', 'experiences', 'delivered', 'artist', 'who', 'really', 'live', 'part', 'rather', 'acting', 'could', 'be', 'supplemented', 'fine', 'would', 'say', 'preferable', 'performances', 'productions', 'featuring', 'Fleming', 'are', 'really', 'spoilt', 'choice', 'here', 'summary', 'therefore', 'regardless', 'preference', 'Gheorghiu', 'performances', 'have', 'still', 'found', 'performance', 'be', 'rewarding', 'terms', 'musical', 'values', 'recording', 'values', 'sound', 'vision', 'combined', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'advantages', 'expected', 'additional', 'recorded', 'clarity', 'levels', 'would', 'be', 'primary', 'recommendation', 'previous', 'DVD', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'good', '4', 'star', 'issue', 'supporters', 'artists', 'particular', 'would', 'probably', 'rate', '5', 'stars']",Verdi: La Traviata - Los Angeles Opera Orchestra & Chorus

I guess I have more copies of this work on audio and video than any other work and this one tops them all.  A luscious, traditional production with beautiful costumes and featuring the superb singing of Renee Fleming, Rolando Villazon and Renato Bruson, it is difficult to imagine anything better will ever emerge.  Renee is lovely to look at and the passion that she and Rolando evoke is very moving and convincingly projected with first rate recording of audio and video.  The second Act can sometimes be a bit relatively flat but not here.  Renato Bruson portrays Germon with dignity and conviction with Rolando putting more passion into throughout the opera than I have seen from anyone.  He surpasses his efforts seen in the other Blu Ray production featuring Netrebco.  This disc is a must for all opera lovers and cannot be more highly recommended.
