1049639,A10NM4PC3209XU,B000MR9CXM,Deevah,"[2, 4]","England ended its ban on homosexuals in the military in January 2000. Male and female homosexuals are now fully integrated within the British military and same-sex partners of those killed in action receive spousal pension from the government. This made for television, four-part story of Sgt. Caroline Meagher (who makes a personal appearance in front of the camera at the end) takes place between 1979 and 1990, when the military was still investigating homosexuals and purging them from its ranks. Although this awful practice was humiliating and devastating to those who were convicted and discharged, it is also important to remember that volunteering for military service is not on the same level as a civilian job -- it means also accepting a way of life that demands a strict observance and obedience of its rules and standards. I have little sympathy for Sgt. Meagher: she knew what she was getting into and got into it enthusiastically; furthermore, she was a rat fink for investigating ""homosexual crimes"" committed by fellow service women while secretly indulging her own homosexual nature. Her ambition to be promoted in rank was more important than being complicit in the destruction of the lives of fellow soldiers. She was not kicked out of the military for being a lesbian because the evidence against her was not sufficient; instead, she was ultimately discharged for lying on the application that allowed her to reside off-base with her lesbian partner. Sgt. Meagher not only lived a double-life, she compounded the lie by falsifying documents in order to do it. Knowing full well the score, what did she expect the outcome of her actions to be?",3,A true story with consequences,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,1664,"['England', 'ended', 'ban', 'homosexuals', 'military', 'January', '2000', 'Male', 'female', 'homosexuals', 'are', 'now', 'fully', 'integrated', 'British', 'military', 'same-sex', 'partners', 'killed', 'action', 'receive', 'spousal', 'pension', 'government', 'made', 'television', 'four-part', 'story', 'Sgt', 'Caroline', 'Meagher', 'who', 'personal', 'appearance', 'front', 'camera', 'end', 'place', '1979', '1990', 'when', 'military', 'was', 'still', 'investigating', 'homosexuals', 'purging', 'ranks', 'awful', 'practice', 'was', 'humiliating', 'devastating', 'who', 'were', 'convicted', 'discharged', 'also', 'important', 'remember', 'volunteering', 'military', 'service', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'civilian', 'job', 'also', 'accepting', 'way', 'life', 'strict', 'observance', 'obedience', 'rules', 'standards', 'have', 'little', 'sympathy', 'Sgt', 'Meagher', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'got', 'enthusiastically', 'furthermore', 'was', 'rat', 'fink', 'investigating', 'homosexual', 'crimes', 'committed', 'fellow', 'service', 'women', 'secretly', 'indulging', 'own', 'homosexual', 'nature', 'ambition', 'be', 'promoted', 'rank', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'being', 'complicit', 'destruction', 'lives', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'was', 'not', 'kicked', 'military', 'being', 'lesbian', 'evidence', 'was', 'not', 'sufficient', 'instead', 'was', 'ultimately', 'discharged', 'lying', 'application', 'allowed', 'reside', 'off-base', 'lesbian', 'partner', 'Sgt', 'Meagher', 'not', 'only', 'lived', 'double-life', 'compounded', 'lie', 'falsifying', 'documents', 'order', 'do', 'Knowing', 'full', 'well', 'score', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'outcome', 'actions', 'be']",N/A

It is Baxendale though, who brings the story of Caroline Meagher, and the many different nuances and shadings of her career and life, to poignant meaning.I recommend this film highly.Running Time: 88 minutes.Not Rated: contains nudity and adult language",4,Very Well Acted and Told British Drama,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,934,"['film', 'told', 'four', 'parts', 'drama', 'UK', 'Helen', 'Baxendale', 'best', 'known', 'US', 'guest', 'role', 'Emily', 'NBC', 'comedy', 'Friends', '.Based', 'true', 'story', 'script', 'developed', 'interviews', 'official', 'documents', 'plot', 'RMP', 'Royal', 'Military', 'Police', 'soldier', 'Witch', 'Hunt', 'days', 'British', 'Military', 'sweeps', 'lesbians', 'ranks.The', 'acting', 'here', 'dead', 'expecting', 'light', 'carefree', 'Emily', 'Friends', 'will', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprised', 'see', 'deliberate', 'talented', 'acting', 'chops', 'displayed', 'Baxendale.Like', 'most', 'UK', 'based', 'dramas', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'supporting', 'cast', 'more', 'effective', 'Baxendale', 'who', 'story', 'Caroline', 'Meagher', 'many', 'different', 'nuances', 'shadings', 'career', 'life', 'poignant', 'meaning.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly.Running', 'Time', '88', 'minutes.Not', 'Rated', 'contains', 'nudity', 'adult', 'language']",N/A
