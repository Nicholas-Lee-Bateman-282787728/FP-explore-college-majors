415831,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304342950,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The level of acting talent in `Jude' certainly helps elevate it from the messy construction and merely serviceable structure of the film.The story tells of young Jude Fawley, a stone mason who dreams of a big education and a richly fulfilling life.  At a young age he winds up married to a woman named Arabella, but his marriage does not work out (lack of love and a supposed curse on the Fowley men).  Venturing off to discover his dreams, Jude becomes acquainted with his cousin, Sue.  Sue is free spirited and intelligent and controversial and simply everything that a man could hope to adore and so, quickly, Jude becomes smitten.  Despite her marriage to a man whom Jude respects (a former teacher of his), Jude and Sue engage in a illicit affair and soon begin their life together.  They are in love, but they are also stubborn (refusing to condition themselves to society's standards of marriage) and this costs them dearly in the end.The story itself is a strong one, but the way that it is woven is a little sub par.  The films first half jumps around far too much, presenting Jude as a bit of an unstable individual (one thing goes wrong and it's back home, then he rashly moves out, then back home) who doesn't know himself enough to understand what is good for him.  He is rather unlikable in my opinion, a tad whiney and uncharismatic.  In fact, Sue's husband Phillotson is far more likable and endearing.  I also found the structure of the film to feel a tad like a made for television movie, like one of those BBC films.  If didn't have that grit to it (the film has a little more polish) but it just felt a tad cheap to me in areas.Where it never fell short though, was the acting.  Even at his whiniest, Christopher Eccleston seemed to understand Jude more than the script did, and his portrayal of him was rather good.  Liam Cunningham was also very well used, as was a ravishing Rachel Griffiths.But this film BELONGS to Kate Winslet.  As Sue Bridehead, Kate sinks down deep into her soul.  What I love about this performance is that it is very meticulously layered, yet it never feels rehearsed or planned out.  You gradually watch her adapt and grow.  When we meet her she is social and captivating, showing off in bars and debating on Christianity and using her impish sexuality as a tool to be heard.  As she matures and her relationship with Jude grows we see her calm her sensual displays and add the texture of hesitance to her interactions.  The seduction scene in Jude's room is a key moment, where she baits him to make love to her without lifting the air of ambiguity that shields her from a bad decision.  When she marries Phillotson we see the doubt creep in, the nervous understanding that she is making a mistake, and as she toys with her own understanding of her feelings for Jude we see her begin to crumble under the pressure she has heaped upon herself.  We finally get a glimpse of her free spirited nature unleashed once again when she attains Jude as her own, but as desperation and circumstance get a hold of her we see her become frail in her own bitterness.  We almost begin to see a resentment in her eyes, but as she opens the door and takes in the films final moment of horror we see that the resentment building was a realization that her errors were being marked and her sins were catching up with her.She was bound to be punished.Hands down, one of the finest performances of the 90's.  Kate Winslet is easily my favorite working actress today (yes, even above the almighty Meryl, and I LOVE ME SOME MERYL STREEP) and this is a prime example as to why.While this film does not truly deliver on all accounts (it can be stiff, confusing, tedious, redundant and emotionally cold) the performances are more than enough for me to HIGHLY recommend you at least see this once.",3,An obscure depiction of a tragic tale...,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,3819,"['level', 'acting', 'talent', 'Jude', 'certainly', 'elevate', 'messy', 'construction', 'merely', 'serviceable', 'structure', 'film.The', 'story', 'tells', 'young', 'Jude', 'Fawley', 'stone', 'mason', 'who', 'big', 'education', 'richly', 'fulfilling', 'life', 'young', 'age', 'up', 'married', 'woman', 'named', 'Arabella', 'marriage', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'lack', 'love', 'supposed', 'curse', 'Fowley', 'men', 'Venturing', 'off', 'discover', 'dreams', 'Jude', 'acquainted', 'cousin', 'Sue', 'Sue', 'free', 'spirited', 'intelligent', 'controversial', 'simply', 'everything', 'man', 'could', 'hope', 'adore', 'so', 'quickly', 'Jude', 'smitten', 'marriage', 'man', 'whom', 'Jude', 'former', 'teacher', 'Jude', 'Sue', 'engage', 'illicit', 'affair', 'soon', 'begin', 'life', 'together', 'are', 'love', 'are', 'also', 'stubborn', 'refusing', 'condition', 'society', 'standards', 'marriage', 'dearly', 'end.The', 'story', 'strong', 'one', 'way', 'woven', 'little', 'sub', 'par', 'films', 'first', 'jumps', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'presenting', 'Jude', 'bit', 'unstable', 'individual', 'one', 'thing', 'wrong', 'back', 'home', 'then', 'moves', 'out', 'then', 'back', 'home', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'understand', 'what', 'good', 'rather', 'unlikable', 'opinion', 'tad', 'whiney', 'uncharismatic', 'fact', 'Sue', 'husband', 'Phillotson', 'far', 'more', 'likable', 'endearing', 'also', 'found', 'structure', 'film', 'feel', 'tad', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'one', 'BBC', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'grit', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'polish', 'just', 'felt', 'tad', 'cheap', 'areas.Where', 'never', 'fell', 'short', 'was', 'acting', 'Even', 'whiniest', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'seemed', 'understand', 'Jude', 'more', 'script', 'did', 'portrayal', 'was', 'rather', 'good', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'used', 'was', 'ravishing', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths.But', 'film', 'BELONGS', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Sue', 'Bridehead', 'Kate', 'down', 'deep', 'soul', 'What', 'love', 'performance', 'very', 'meticulously', 'layered', 'never', 'rehearsed', 'planned', 'out', 'gradually', 'watch', 'adapt', 'grow', 'When', 'meet', 'social', 'captivating', 'showing', 'off', 'bars', 'debating', 'Christianity', 'using', 'impish', 'sexuality', 'tool', 'be', 'heard', 'relationship', 'Jude', 'see', 'calm', 'sensual', 'displays', 'add', 'texture', 'hesitance', 'interactions', 'seduction', 'scene', 'Jude', 'room', 'key', 'moment', 'where', 'make', 'love', 'lifting', 'air', 'ambiguity', 'bad', 'decision', 'When', 'Phillotson', 'see', 'doubt', 'creep', 'nervous', 'understanding', 'making', 'mistake', 'own', 'understanding', 'feelings', 'Jude', 'see', 'begin', 'crumble', 'pressure', 'heaped', 'finally', 'get', 'glimpse', 'free', 'spirited', 'nature', 'unleashed', 'once', 'again', 'when', 'Jude', 'own', 'desperation', 'circumstance', 'get', 'hold', 'see', 'become', 'frail', 'own', 'bitterness', 'almost', 'begin', 'see', 'resentment', 'eyes', 'door', 'films', 'final', 'moment', 'horror', 'see', 'resentment', 'building', 'was', 'realization', 'errors', 'were', 'being', 'marked', 'sins', 'were', 'catching', 'up', 'her.She', 'was', 'bound', 'be', 'punished.Hands', 'down', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', '90', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'easily', 'favorite', 'working', 'actress', 'today', 'yes', 'even', 'almighty', 'Meryl', 'LOVE', 'ME', 'SOME', 'MERYL', 'STREEP', 'prime', 'example', 'why.While', 'film', 'not', 'truly', 'deliver', 'accounts', 'can', 'be', 'stiff', 'confusing', 'tedious', 'redundant', 'emotionally', 'cold', 'performances', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'least', 'see', 'once']",Jude VHS

415836,AUDIJM3VUULS7,6304342950,Charles Tatum,"[3, 4]","Over one hundred years ago, Thomas Hardy experienced critical backlash against his novel ""Jude the Obscure"" and never wrote another novel. This film version is also controversial, but definitely worth a look.This stars Christopher Eccleston in the title role as a stonemason who yearns for higher learning and a better life. Eccleston's portrayal of Jude is excellent in that he is no Hollywood pretty boy. His ears are too big and his face sallow, but his expressions and gaunt look help his performance immensely, especially in the latter half of the film. Too bad the audience is left in the dark about what exactly makes his character tick.Jude's cousin, Sue, is played by Kate Winslet. She brings a professionalism to her role that almost overshadows Eccleston. Every nuance of her work here does not seem calculated, but very natural.Jude's wife, Arabella, who leaves him, but keeps popping back into his life over and over again, is played by Rachel Griffiths. Her character is a major flaw in the film. Gothicism was fading in the time this novel was written; readers were experiencing more real situations in novels by the likes of Charles Dickens, or fantastic situations in novels by H.G. Wells. Arabella seems old hat in a period film. When she is introduced, the scene is full of sunshine and utopian bliss. Throughout the film, she appears in black widow's wear, striking a contrast against gray backgrounds and the forced happiness of Jude and Sue. This role screamed for a more intense actress along the lines of Nicole Kidman or Emily Watson. Griffiths does not have the presenced needed. Any other actress would have taken the part and sunk her teeth into it, but Griffiths comes across as a pitiful old maid without a thought in her head. In the beginning of the film, in her cutesy courtship with Jude, another actress may have appeared whimsical and innocent, Griffiths plays Arabella like a moron.The director is well known in British and art house circles. His direction is expert, and different from other adaptations of long English novels. Winterbottom uses filmed captions to let the viewer know where Jude's travels take him. The film opens during Jude's childhood, and Winterbottom shoots the entire sequence in black and white, evoking antiquated romantic memories of childhood. The screenwriter, Hossein Amini, and Winterbottom load the film with too much sex, after a while it almost overshadows the plot and characters. The musical score and set design are marvelous and i would highly recommend this film to others, but maybe not as a study aid for Thomas Hardy-reading high school students. The film has plenty of raw emotion (including the stinging fate of Sue and Jude's children), but Jude's character remains, pardon the pun, obscure. There is something great here, despite the flaws.This is rated (R) for physical violence, gore, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, and strong adult situations.",5,Michael Winterbottom's Jude,1023235200,"06 5, 2002",2002,2942,"['one', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'experienced', 'critical', 'backlash', 'novel', 'Jude', 'Obscure', 'never', 'wrote', 'novel', 'film', 'version', 'also', 'controversial', 'definitely', 'look.This', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'title', 'role', 'stonemason', 'who', 'higher', 'learning', 'better', 'life', 'Eccleston', 'portrayal', 'Jude', 'excellent', 'Hollywood', 'pretty', 'boy', 'ears', 'are', 'too', 'big', 'face', 'sallow', 'expressions', 'gaunt', 'look', 'help', 'performance', 'immensely', 'especially', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'Too', 'bad', 'audience', 'left', 'dark', 'what', 'exactly', 'character', 'tick.Jude', 'cousin', 'Sue', 'played', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'professionalism', 'role', 'almost', 'Eccleston', 'Every', 'nuance', 'work', 'here', 'not', 'seem', 'calculated', 'very', 'natural.Jude', 'wife', 'Arabella', 'who', 'popping', 'back', 'life', 'over', 'again', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'character', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'Gothicism', 'was', 'fading', 'time', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'readers', 'were', 'experiencing', 'more', 'real', 'situations', 'novels', 'likes', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'fantastic', 'situations', 'novels', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Arabella', 'old', 'hat', 'period', 'film', 'When', 'introduced', 'scene', 'full', 'sunshine', 'utopian', 'bliss', 'film', 'black', 'widow', 'wear', 'striking', 'contrast', 'gray', 'backgrounds', 'forced', 'happiness', 'Jude', 'Sue', 'role', 'screamed', 'more', 'intense', 'actress', 'lines', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Griffiths', 'not', 'have', 'presenced', 'needed', 'other', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'part', 'sunk', 'teeth', 'Griffiths', 'across', 'pitiful', 'old', 'maid', 'thought', 'head', 'beginning', 'film', 'cutesy', 'courtship', 'Jude', 'actress', 'may', 'have', 'appeared', 'whimsical', 'innocent', 'Griffiths', 'Arabella', 'moron.The', 'director', 'well', 'known', 'British', 'art', 'house', 'circles', 'direction', 'expert', 'different', 'other', 'adaptations', 'long', 'English', 'novels', 'Winterbottom', 'filmed', 'captions', 'let', 'viewer', 'know', 'where', 'Jude', 'travels', 'take', 'film', 'Jude', 'childhood', 'Winterbottom', 'shoots', 'entire', 'sequence', 'black', 'white', 'evoking', 'antiquated', 'romantic', 'memories', 'childhood', 'screenwriter', 'Hossein', 'Amini', 'Winterbottom', 'load', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'sex', 'while', 'almost', 'plot', 'characters', 'musical', 'score', 'set', 'design', 'are', 'marvelous', 'i', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'others', 'maybe', 'not', 'study', 'aid', 'Thomas', 'Hardy-reading', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'film', 'plenty', 'raw', 'emotion', 'including', 'stinging', 'fate', 'Sue', 'Jude', 'children', 'Jude', 'character', 'pardon', 'pun', 'obscure', 'something', 'great', 'here', 'flaws.This', 'rated', 'R', 'physical', 'violence', 'gore', 'female', 'nudity', 'male', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'content', 'strong', 'adult', 'situations']",Jude VHS
415837,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6304342950,Dennis Littrell,"[15, 18]","This pessimistic and rather brutal cinematic production is based on the nineteenth century novel Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy.  A bowdlerized and altered version of that novel first appeared in Harper's New Monthly Magazine as a serial beginning in December 1894.  Its original title was ""The Simpletons,"" a title modern viewers of this movie might find appropriate considering how Jude and Sue round out their lives.It need hardly be said that any motion picture, and certainly not one running only about two hours, can hope to do justice to Hardy's novel (his last, incidentally) which is about 180,000 words long (about 400 pages of dense text).  An earlier TV mini series version made by the BBC that I have not seen, Jude the Obscure (1971), ran for almost four and a half hours in six episodes.  But this is a pretty good movie anyway, highlighted by an enthralling performance by Kate Winslet.The movie starts rather slowly, if picturesquely, until Kate appears and then the movie comes to life.  I have seen Winslet in several films, including her first feature film when she was18-years-old, Heavenly Creatures (1994), an interesting film made in New Zealand based on a sensational matricide from the 1950s.  She was very good in that film, her budding talent immediately obvious as the spinning, laughing, crazy teen who went off the deep end emotionally.  In Jude, Winslet's sharp, confident and commanding style is given greater range and she comes across with a performance that is full of life, effervescent, delightful, witty, sly, clever, and very expressive, and she looks beautiful doing it.The story itself, a naturalistic tragedy that in some respects anticipates Theodore Dreiser, et al., was considered immoral in its time.  ""The Bishop of Wakefield, disgusted with the novel's &lt;insolence and indecency&gt;, threw it in the fire,"" according to Terry Eagleton who wrote the Introduction for the New Wessex Edition of the book.  Modern film goers will hardly notice the implied critique of marriage that offended Victorian readers, but they might find the scene where Arabella throws the pig's ""part"" at Jude indelicate.  Victorian readers found that scene most offensive.  As a public service I want to warn any modern viewer who might be offended at seeing Kate Winslet naked to avoid this film.  (Just Joking: Kate is quite fetching in the Rubenesque shot.)  To be honest, though, this really is a tragedy that still has the power to offend some sensibilities.  Certainly you don't want the kids to see it.Christopher Eccleston plays Jude and does a good job, and Rachel Griffiths in a modest part plays Jude's first wife Arabella.  Director Michael Winterbottom stayed spiritually true to Hardy's dark vision while tailoring the tale for modern audiences.  There's a nice period piece feel and some charming cinematography.  The denouement is well set up and so realistically done that we don't know whether to be horrified or outraged.

415838,A84UFSF2SZS2W,6304342950,"EriKa ""E""","[1, 5]","Never having read the book on which this is based I was not sure what to expect. This is a period piece, and Kate Winslet is beautiful and stunning here as always. However, lest you think the story will be boring, which it seems to be from its first 20 minutes, wait and see the development of the plot. A young man, Jude Fawley, studies all the time. He wants to go to college, but he falls into lust with a young woman (Rachel Griffiths) and she claims to be pregnant. He marries her and defers his dreams of going to college. She eventually runs off and leaves a letter stating that she was never pregnant. You think this is the last you will see of her, but it isn't. It never is in cases such as these. Jude goes off to college and there is meets Sue. Winslet as Sue is a bright, witty, intelligent and unconventional woman who will not bend to the conventions of society or of the church. Her cousin, Jude, is quite a scholar and falls in love with Sue even before he realises she is his cousin. Eventually they fall in love with each other despite the fact that they know it is wrong to be in love with one's own cousin. Winslet bears two children with Jude, and sometime during all of this, Griffiths returns and gives Jude custody of the child she did indeed bear him. The family is poor but seemingly happy, and they travel around to keep people from finding out their secret (having children out of wedlock with one's own cousin is not looked upon fondly). However, just when things seem to be changing economically, the child Jude had with Griffiths murders the other two children and then hangs himself. Sue turns on Jude and leaves him, spending her life almost exclusively in church, suddenly changing her entire belief system. It is a sad, gripping, and heartbreaking story.

415839,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,6304342950,"""eurotrashgirl""","[30, 30]","In this 1996 adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel, Jude the Obscure, a sad, archetypal story plays itself out across the rainy English landscape, helped along by brilliant acting and directing alike.Though the film is  admittedly incredibly bleak, and the ending sad beyond words, it is  all-told a brilliant, classic film.After a short opening sequence  introducing us to the young Jude, the viewer is quickly drawn into the  parameters of Jude's adult world. Almost at once, we begin to feel his  pain, his longing, his hope, and his persistence. We understand well what  is driving him in his journey through life. This is a novel brought to  life, a story in motion.As a die-hard fan of Kate Winslet, I have to say  that this film one of my Winslet favorites. In my view, 1997's blockbuster  Titanic was not only a success as a box office triumph or well-loved film  in its own right, but also because it opened the world's eyes to the talent  of this young British actress, whose consistently fine performances and  willingness to break through barriers as an actress have brought the world  great joy on the silver screen, and will surely continue to do so well into  the new millenium.  In Jude, Winslet is charismatic and beautiful (as  usual), and plays Sue Brideheard to a tee. Introduced to her in a small,  well-loved photograph, we soon come to understand what Jude sees in her.  Her beauty, her intelligence, her promise of a better life. Her laughter  still echoes in my head, like the flashbacks in the film. She is youth, she  is carefree, she is unattainable, she is a vision, a memory,  love.Eccleston is perfect for the role of the ever-yearning Jude, his  face a landscape of green hills, rain, cobblestone streets and stone  carvings, and green hills yet again. There are shadows in his eyes, in his  face. The depth of his feelings is well-conveyed. His tall frame is so  strong and able in one way, so thin and aching in another. We walk with  him, cry with him, and love him as we must love ourselves when fate comes  crashing down upon us.P.S. This was my introduction to British actress  Rachel Griffiths, who went on to star in Hilary and Jackie, and is  currently starring in Me, Myself, and I. Although her role is smaller than  Eccleston's and Winslet's, and her character perhaps less likable, she also  does a fine job.",5,Jude the Obscure - English Novel Brought to Life,957744000,"05 8, 2000",2000,2350,"['1996', 'adaptation', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'Jude', 'Obscure', 'sad', 'archetypal', 'story', 'plays', 'out', 'rainy', 'English', 'landscape', 'helped', 'along', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'directing', 'film', 'admittedly', 'incredibly', 'bleak', 'ending', 'sad', 'words', 'all-told', 'brilliant', 'classic', 'film.After', 'short', 'opening', 'sequence', 'introducing', 'young', 'Jude', 'viewer', 'quickly', 'drawn', 'parameters', 'Jude', 'adult', 'world', 'once', 'begin', 'feel', 'pain', 'longing', 'hope', 'persistence', 'understand', 'well', 'what', 'driving', 'journey', 'life', 'novel', 'brought', 'life', 'story', 'motion.As', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'one', 'Winslet', 'favorites', 'view', '1997', 'blockbuster', 'Titanic', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'triumph', 'well-loved', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'opened', 'world', 'eyes', 'talent', 'young', 'British', 'actress', 'consistently', 'fine', 'performances', 'willingness', 'break', 'through', 'barriers', 'actress', 'have', 'brought', 'world', 'great', 'joy', 'silver', 'screen', 'will', 'surely', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'new', 'millenium', 'Jude', 'Winslet', 'charismatic', 'beautiful', 'usual', 'plays', 'Sue', 'Brideheard', 'tee', 'Introduced', 'small', 'well-loved', 'photograph', 'soon', 'come', 'understand', 'what', 'Jude', 'beauty', 'intelligence', 'promise', 'better', 'life', 'laughter', 'still', 'head', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'youth', 'carefree', 'unattainable', 'vision', 'memory', 'love.Eccleston', 'perfect', 'role', 'ever-yearning', 'Jude', 'face', 'landscape', 'green', 'hills', 'rain', 'cobblestone', 'streets', 'stone', 'carvings', 'green', 'hills', 'yet', 'again', 'are', 'shadows', 'eyes', 'face', 'depth', 'feelings', 'well-conveyed', 'tall', 'frame', 'so', 'strong', 'able', 'one', 'way', 'so', 'thin', 'aching', 'walk', 'cry', 'love', 'must', 'love', 'when', 'fate', 'crashing', 'down', 'upon', 'us.P.S', 'was', 'introduction', 'British', 'actress', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'went', 'star', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'currently', 'starring', 'Me', 'Myself', 'role', 'smaller', 'Eccleston', 'Winslet', 'character', 'perhaps', 'less', 'likable', 'also', 'fine', 'job']",Jude VHS

Thomas Hardy's last novel ""Jude the Obscure"" was so poorly received that he didn't write another.  But the thing about good period piece adaptations is that they remain interesting long after their initial release.  This 1996 film is no different in its DVD release.As the brooding Jude Fawley Christopher Eccleston who was in ""28 Days Later"" & ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman does a good job with the many emotional layers of this character.  Born in the lower class, he longed to be educated.  But his hormones cause him to marry Arabella in an ill-fated arrangement.  Then his attraction to his cousin and his dedication to their illicit love are entrancing.Australian actress Rachel Griffiths from the ""Six Feet Under"" TV series and who was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Hillary & Jackie"" does a good job in the part of Jude's wife Arrabella.  The character in the screenplay seems not well fleshed.  We're not totally sure why the two break off.Kate Winslett with her 3 Oscar nominations (""Sense & Sensibility,"" ""The Titantic,"" & ""Iris"") is a vivid actress upon whose face a range of emotions and nuances are reflected.  As Jude's cousin Sue, she is a feminist prototype.  We watch her aversion to religion and then her embrace of it after the death of her children in amazement as the actress covers such range.At Jude's urging, Sue marries schoolteacher Phillotson, but it is a loveless affair.  Liam Cunningham plays Phillotson excellently and delicately.  His affection for Sue is as delightful as it unrequited.Eduardo Serra did the cinematography as he did for ""Beyond the Sea,"" ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre.""  The look of the film is exquisite and lyrical.Thomas Hardy's story is hardly the social shocker it was in its day.

Certainly it is not recommended that one read the novel, Jude the Obscure, before viewing. How many films have failed to live up to the expectations of the literary adaptation? Why would this be any different? Jude is a man of humble birth who strives to rise above his allotment in life. Rather than approaching the subject as a modern fairy tale where dreams do come true, the standard treatment in cinema, there is a grim realism which reflects the destructive nature of impractical and unnatural compulsions. Jude attempts to fly in the face of social convention in a headlong flight of self-destruction which at times has the horrific fascination of a slow motion train wreck, one is disturbed by the sight but unable to turn away. I knew nothing of this film save that the title characters were played by the extremely talented pair, Kate Winslet and Christopher Eccleston. That was sufficient enticement for me and as always I was not disappointed by the performances. Despite the current trend to degrade the &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; production style actors and directors of immense talent breath life into even the dullest works. Dull this film isn't but grim it certainly is. Only a brave director would tackle this kind of project. How much easier it would have been to soften the hard edge to  make the viewing more palatable. There is much to be gleaned from witnessing in all its ugliness the past stigmatization of relationships we now accept as commonplace.

415849,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6304342950,Mr. Cairene,"[5, 6]","Thomas Hardy was perhaps the most depressingly lyrical of 19th century novelists, Jude the Obscure the novel on which this film is based was his final work of fiction and caused a great controversy when it was published  in 1894. I had the (mis)fortune of studying a few of his peoms in  highschool. The degree of which you appreciate his work depends on how much  you value your happiness.Michael Winterbottom's film doesn't shy away  from the grimness of its source material, as a result the film can not be  enjoyed, only admired. The first half of the film doesn't work nearly as  well as the second, it feels like what it is, a large literaly novel  compressed into a series of arbitrary scenes that have trouble following  one another, i.e. long periods of time pass and characters change within  minutes. It is only in the second half, when the film gets oppresively  bleak that it becomes truly absorbing.Christopher Eccleston plays Jude  Fawley, a self educated man who wants to be a scholar, but is reduced to a  stonemason(carving stone for us mortals) by the British class system. When  he meets his cousin Sue Whitehead played by Kate Winslet it is love at  first sight, but trouble arises when he reveals that he is married and she  in turn marries another man in a fit of defiance. Eccleston is superb as  Jude, bright and idealistic in the beginning and gradually losing his faith  towards the end, and in turn Winslet gives one of her many terrific  performances. There are clear arcs which their characters follow, her  feminist Sue being broken by an unforgiving society/god/religion and his  Jude similarly disheartened.Jude actually has the exact same theme as  Graham Greene's The End of The Affair which was adapted into a masterful  film by Neil Jordan. Both accuse God (or the belief in him) of being  vicious to the free spirited. But Jude doesn't have the poetic flow of that  film.The much talked about (at least among my classmates) sex scenes  are not the titilation they are in most hollywood films. The sex here is  bare and filled with mournful guilt and is therefore genuinely erotic.  Winterbottom documents everything with graphic attention to detail, he  gives us gutted pigs, rabbits with broken necks and lots of cold sweat.

415852,AHZFJ1Z2A3FKQ,6304342950,"Spare-Time Critic ""Deb""","[38, 45]","While I realize a filmmaker can't be expected to slavishly follow the original text word for word, most go too far in remaking the characters as they see fit.  &quot;Jude&quot; is a good example.  In this version, Sue has been crystalized from a flighty woman &quot;in love with being loved&quot; to an opinionated pre-feminist.  Arabella has peeled off several layers of crassness to reveal a pragmatic, self-sufficient person who is simply trying to get by.  Even Aunt Drusilla must have found better living through medication; she's now a basically good-hearted person who cares deeply for her adopted nephew!  After I got past those little changes, I had to take a skeptical look at Jude himself -- with everyone around him now presented in such a sympathetic light, you start wondering, &quot;What's HIS problem?&quot;For example, since Arabella's basic lack of compassion is never exposed, one can only wonder why Jude leaves the house as she's butchering the pig:  Is he sickened by the sight of blood?  Is he repulsed by seeing his bride up to her elbows in pig entrails?  In the book version, the issue was that Arabella wanted to prolong the pig's death to make the meat tastier, while Jude insisted on putting the poor creature out of its misery.  In the movie, you might assume he'd thought bacon grew on trees.Another change from book to film:  &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; was considered scandalous when it was published, but what can shock a jaded '90s audience?  Hmm... *ponder*... Oh, I know!  More sex scenes!  Suffice it to say, if you've ever wondered what Kate Winslet looks like in the buff, you need wonder no more.  As for Christopher Eccleston, a fig leaf would've covered everything we didn't see.  There's a lot more eroticism here than the book called for.  Whether that's a good thing is to be determined by the eye of the beholder.The ending, like the title, is sharply abbreviated.  Without the book as a reference, you'll be left wondering how things all turned out.Overall, I thought the movie failed to either remain true to the original or stand on its own merits.",2,Jude the Confused: &quot;Why is everyone suddenly so likeable?&quot;,998352000,"08 21, 2001",2001,2099,"['realize', 'filmmaker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'expected', 'slavishly', 'follow', 'original', 'text', 'word', 'word', 'most', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'remaking', 'characters', 'see', 'fit', 'quot', 'Jude', 'quot', 'good', 'example', 'version', 'Sue', 'been', 'crystalized', 'flighty', 'woman', 'quot', 'love', 'being', 'loved', 'quot', 'opinionated', 'pre-feminist', 'Arabella', 'peeled', 'off', 'several', 'layers', 'crassness', 'reveal', 'pragmatic', 'self-sufficient', 'person', 'who', 'simply', 'trying', 'get', 'Even', 'Aunt', 'Drusilla', 'must', 'have', 'found', 'better', 'living', 'medication', 'now', 'basically', 'good-hearted', 'person', 'who', 'deeply', 'adopted', 'nephew', 'got', 'past', 'little', 'changes', 'had', 'take', 'skeptical', 'look', 'Jude', 'everyone', 'now', 'presented', 'such', 'sympathetic', 'light', 'start', 'wondering', 'quot', 'What', 'HIS', 'problem', 'quot', 'example', 'Arabella', 'basic', 'lack', 'compassion', 'never', 'exposed', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'why', 'Jude', 'house', 'butchering', 'pig', 'sickened', 'sight', 'blood', 'repulsed', 'seeing', 'bride', 'up', 'elbows', 'pig', 'entrails', 'book', 'version', 'issue', 'was', 'Arabella', 'wanted', 'prolong', 'pig', 'death', 'make', 'meat', 'tastier', 'Jude', 'insisted', 'putting', 'poor', 'creature', 'misery', 'movie', 'might', 'assume', ""'d"", 'thought', 'bacon', 'grew', 'trees.Another', 'change', 'book', 'film', 'quot', 'Jude', 'Obscure', 'quot', 'was', 'considered', 'scandalous', 'when', 'was', 'published', 'what', 'can', 'shock', 'jaded', ""'90s"", 'audience', 'Hmm', '*ponder*', 'Oh', 'know', 'More', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Suffice', 'say', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'buff', 'need', 'wonder', 'more', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'fig', 'leaf', 'would', ""'ve"", 'covered', 'everything', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'eroticism', 'here', 'book', 'called', 'Whether', 'good', 'thing', 'be', 'determined', 'eye', 'beholder.The', 'ending', 'title', 'sharply', 'abbreviated', 'book', 'reference', ""'ll"", 'be', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'things', 'turned', 'out.Overall', 'thought', 'movie', 'failed', 'remain', 'true', 'original', 'stand', 'own', 'merits']",Jude VHS
