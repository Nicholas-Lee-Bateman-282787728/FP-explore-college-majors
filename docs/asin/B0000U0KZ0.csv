I do a lot of weight training and Tae Bo, so I wanted something a bit more feminine that would still work up a sweat.  This was it!  The dancers are regular people, the rhythm is contagious, and even though it takes doing it a few times to get the moves down, it's worth the effort.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it doesn't burn as many calories as Tae Bo, and I would like to find a dance-based workout that does.

Schneider,"[12, 12]","I work out daily with a variety of workouts from more strenuous cardio works out to Pilates and Yoga but one of my favorite workouts is anything dance related.  This looked fun and it is!  If you have done dance type work outs before you will recognize some of the types of steps and after a time or two will have the routine down.  I enjoy the percussion and the steps.  Only a couple draw backs, the instructional segment slows you down a bit after you have already mastered the moves, it is too bad you couldn't have a section that you could learn the moves first and then go to the routine and be uninterrupted by half tempo moves.  The other area is the head rolls during the warm up.  NEVER a good idea to roll your head to the back in a full circle.  This grinds your disks at your neck together.  Skip that step and just do the rolls to the front and side.  Other than that, it is a fun workout where you can really gear it to your own pace.  It is not a heartpounding cardio workout, but you do get your heart rate up if you are putting some ooomph in the moves.

783848,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,B0000U0KZ0,Joanna Daneman,"[221, 222]","I have wanted to learn that tricky Samba step ever since I went to visit cousins in Brazil years ago. I came away with a love of Brazilian music and dance, but I never was able to pick up that samba step--I'm not much of a dancer. Here is a workout tape with something to aim for; not only fitness, but learning those appealing dance routines from Carnival.The tape begins with a longish warm up; a good idea as Brazilian dance, based on African style moves, requires you use EVERY part of your body. So you, like me, may not have moved some of those parts for quite a while. You shake your arms, roll your head, contract and roll the back and do hip swivels, and plenty of shoulder moves, too. The warm up is possibly a sufficient workout for someone very unfit or elderly, in fact.The first dance sequence is done at half-tempo--but, here's my problem. The first step is not explained (a cross and back) but the easier back undulation at the end IS given instruction. Sure, some people have trouble undulating their spine, but the footwork also needed a bit of elucidation. Still, you can replay that part of the DVD til you get it--but it's a bit of a nuisance not to have a different camera angle or a talk-through. So plan on stopping and starting the DVD as you learn these steps before you can get a non-stop Samba workout.This workout is particularly excellent for back flexibility. And on that note, if you do hAVE back problems, you might have difficulties with the upper body parts of this workout so consider your own limitations.The filming is a bit dull--outdoors in a field with palm trees on a portable parquet dance floor. The usual ""one from every kind"" dance troupe of elderly, young, thin, plump, dark, light is included to make the viewer feel included. But the camera stays at a boring same distance. I wanted some more close ups and perhaps some alternate camera angles as well.The music is drums and bells, typical samba rhythm, and very pleasant.Summary: if you want a fun, dance workout, plan on spending some time learning the moves and then enjoy a very thorough, body-moving dance session.",4,Actually teaches you Brazilian dance while you work out,1094688000,"09 9, 2004",2004,2118,"['have', 'wanted', 'learn', 'tricky', 'Samba', 'step', 'ever', 'went', 'visit', 'cousins', 'Brazil', 'years', 'ago', 'came', 'away', 'love', 'Brazilian', 'music', 'dance', 'never', 'was', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'samba', 'step', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'dancer', 'Here', 'workout', 'tape', 'something', 'aim', 'not', 'only', 'fitness', 'learning', 'appealing', 'dance', 'routines', 'Carnival.The', 'tape', 'longish', 'warm', 'up', 'good', 'idea', 'Brazilian', 'dance', 'based', 'African', 'style', 'moves', 'use', 'EVERY', 'part', 'body', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'moved', 'parts', 'quite', 'while', 'shake', 'arms', 'roll', 'head', 'contract', 'roll', 'back', 'do', 'hip', 'swivels', 'plenty', 'shoulder', 'moves', 'too', 'warm', 'up', 'possibly', 'sufficient', 'workout', 'someone', 'very', 'unfit', 'elderly', 'fact.The', 'first', 'dance', 'sequence', 'done', 'half-tempo', 'here', 'problem', 'first', 'step', 'not', 'explained', 'cross', 'back', 'easier', 'back', 'undulation', 'end', 'IS', 'given', 'instruction', 'Sure', 'people', 'have', 'trouble', 'undulating', 'spine', 'footwork', 'also', 'needed', 'bit', 'elucidation', 'Still', 'can', 'replay', 'part', 'DVD', 'til', 'get', 'bit', 'nuisance', 'not', 'have', 'different', 'camera', 'angle', 'talk-through', 'So', 'plan', 'stopping', 'starting', 'DVD', 'learn', 'steps', 'can', 'get', 'non-stop', 'Samba', 'workout.This', 'workout', 'particularly', 'excellent', 'back', 'flexibility', 'note', 'do', 'hAVE', 'back', 'problems', 'might', 'have', 'difficulties', 'upper', 'body', 'parts', 'workout', 'so', 'consider', 'own', 'limitations.The', 'filming', 'bit', 'dull', 'outdoors', 'field', 'palm', 'trees', 'portable', 'parquet', 'dance', 'floor', 'usual', 'one', 'kind', 'dance', 'troupe', 'elderly', 'young', 'thin', 'plump', 'dark', 'light', 'included', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'included', 'camera', 'boring', 'same', 'distance', 'wanted', 'more', 'close', 'ups', 'perhaps', 'alternate', 'camera', 'well.The', 'music', 'drums', 'bells', 'typical', 'samba', 'rhythm', 'very', 'pleasant.Summary', 'want', 'fun', 'dance', 'workout', 'plan', 'spending', 'time', 'learning', 'moves', 'then', 'enjoy', 'very', 'thorough', 'body-moving', 'dance', 'session']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised. Challenging, fun moves, added together quickly, which you can do at your own level and intensify as you get better, but always require a lot more concentration, listening, watching, and hard work to do right.  There is a lot of back and core work here, so ease into it - if you're not used to using those muscles, as I imagine most Americans are not, you could really, really hurt yourself. But if you start small and work up, this will be a refreshing new way of working out and will definitely make you sweat. An earlier poster complained about the simplicity of the angles - in my case, I was REALLY glad it always gave me the whole-body movement, since Brazilian dance moves always use the whole, whole body and it kept me in good form.  And - hey, since there's no reason one can't have fun while watching - there's an amazing male dancer who was just incredible to watch - both because he was awfully good-looking (!) and because his movement was just a little different than the female dancers.

""Buyer Beware"" because you could seriously hurt your knees or stress your heart trying to keep up with this challenging DVD.  This isn't coming from a couch slouch either.  I attend regular dance classes and was once a dancer.  I wish the workout came in different versions, for beginner, intermediate or advanced.  As a dancer I'd say this one is intermediate/advanced.  The plus side is that the teacher is engaging and dedicated to her dance form; she just needs to work harder on the teaching part.  The live drumming is great!  The solos are wonderful--a definite plus, to see so many different styles.  I like the fact that there are dancers of various ages, sizes, male and female.

One of the background dancers was a man, which was nice to see!  Most of my DVDs use only women background dancers.I loved the live music!  She had a band right there with her, and the camera cut to them now and then.  Fun to watch!I was happy that she kept us marching in place while she explained things.  Sure I could march on my own when an instructor doesn't tell us to, but I'm lazy, so I'd rather be told to do it.The bad things were minor: The DVD was really loud.  The music was loud, so she had to nearly shout to be heard; I had to turn the sound lower on my TV than I ever had before.And, as I mentioned, she moved a little fast. It was hard to see the new steps, to see how they were done, so even on the fifth time through I wasn't really doing them right... but even so, it was still fun to do!So all in all, I'd recommend this DVD!",4,"Hard time following it, but still enjoyed it",1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,1134,"['non-dancer', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'DVD', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'use', ""'ll"", 'be', 'using', 'again', 'might', 'even', 'get', 'regular', 'rotation', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'good', 'background', 'dancers', 'had', 'very', 'varied', 'body', 'types', 'including', 'two', 'were', 'nearly', 'overweight', 'One', 'background', 'dancers', 'was', 'man', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Most', 'DVDs', 'use', 'only', 'women', 'dancers.I', 'loved', 'live', 'music', 'had', 'band', 'right', 'there', 'camera', 'cut', 'now', 'then', 'Fun', 'watch', 'was', 'happy', 'kept', 'marching', 'place', 'explained', 'things', 'Sure', 'could', 'march', 'own', 'when', 'instructor', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'m"", 'lazy', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'told', 'do', 'it.The', 'bad', 'things', 'were', 'minor', 'DVD', 'was', 'really', 'loud', 'music', 'was', 'loud', 'had', 'nearly', 'shout', 'be', 'heard', 'had', 'turn', 'sound', 'lower', 'TV', 'ever', 'had', 'before.And', 'mentioned', 'moved', 'little', 'fast', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'new', 'steps', 'see', 'how', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'even', 'fifth', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'doing', 'right', 'even', 'so', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'do', 'So', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A
