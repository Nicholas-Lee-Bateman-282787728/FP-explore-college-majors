ZNMD is about such a raod trip as three friends travel across the country in Spain, changing their lives forever.The director's brother Farhan Akhtar had made a film on his debut which was about friendship but this sophomoric debut by his sister Zoya is completely different from the Dil Chahta Hain.Abhay Deol is plannig to get married to Kalki Koechlin but before he does, he wants to have a road trip in Spain with his childhood buddies- Farhaan Akhtar and Hrithik  Each of them will choose an adventure sport and will participate in it, whether they like it or not. It is during the road trip that they meet women, resolve issues in their life and live lie to the fullest.This is a fantastc film in all respects, I had loved 'Luck by chance' and this one furthers the evidence that Zoya Akhtar is one of the most underappreaciated but one of the greatest directors that we have on the scene today.Hrithik Roshan is great throughout the film and so are Farhan Akhtar and Abhay Deol. Karina Kaif looks pretty after a long time and Kalki Koechlin plays the part of the possesive girlfriend ably.Shankar . Ehsaan and Loy have gven us a decent soundtrack. Especially 'Senorita'Carlos Catalan's cinematography transforms the film and the locations are superb.I thought these scenes were the best:Kalki's expression when she watches the friends walk in the lobby, while Ajay is cradling Katrina in his arms.The song SenoritaThe tomatino festival in SpainThe Sky diving sceneThe events that led to the engagement of Kalki and AjayFarhaans meeting his father for the first time and his conversation with his mom.The song in the climax.ZNMD is one of the better films of the year and Zoya  Akhtar has created an anticipation for her next work.

It's nothing but a snooze fest. The only redeeming aspect of the film is the beautiful scenery that is Spain.

Spain is a beautiful country, and it's glorified well in this film. Plus, the underwater scenes and the skydiving part, and the tomato fight festival, and the bull running traditions were all really great scenes to watch and enjoy. I'm happy I got this film.

The movie works for one main reason that the four characters played by Katrina, Hrithink, Imran and Abhay are very easily relatable. In fact, I think all of us who have watched this movie would have felt at many points that the dilemmas and the emotional conflicts which they go through are the ones that we too have gone through at some points in our lives. And that we too perhaps need to discover the spirit of Katrina's charatcer, to feel, enjoy and live life the way it is supposed to be. The picturesque and sangunie Spain and the way the scenes have been shot is an important aspect, for it indeed helps us understand why the three men feel the way they do and why they realise that Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara.Katrina once again proves and with consummate ease, why she is the best actress Bollywood has ever seen. She is not only a Goddess to look at but the comfort and ease with she portrays this carefree character while retaining her feminine appeal at all times, says a lot about her actining abilities. The scene where she is talking to the ""three musketeers"" over shots of vodka is a case in point.The cynicism of Indian journalists/critics who are from a generation when Indians suffered from a serious inferiority complex about their abilities and everything in general and every person and event was looked at with doubt and suspicion, find flaws with her accent and acting because they can NOT believe that there can be anyone who can have it all - who is impeccably pretty and can act well too. A reminder to all such people - ""Not everyone who lives amongst humans is necessarily human - there are Goddesses too"".Katrina needs to seriously learn from Shah-rukh-Khan some tricks about self promotion and media manipulation. She must not let her talent go unnoticed due to poor PR. She is brilliant and amazing.Kalki, was the only sore point in the movie. I felt like skipping the chapters in which she appeared but did not want to loose on the continuity of the goings on. She should restrict herself only to the dark, with-an-ugly-under-belly, weird kind of movies which her dark, with-an-ugly-under-belly, weird husband produces.All three men did a good job. It showed that they had understood and imbibed the three characters well, before the cameras started rolling.Naseer's cameo was a surprise and he did a phenomenal job of it. With a total footage of 2 minutes or so, it is only a seasoned and a born actor who can convince the viewer that he is indeed the character that he portrays and not some 300 films old veteran who has every imaginable accolade to his credit.This movie surely deserves a place in my collection and Katrina in my temple.",4,This movie surely deserves a place in my collection and Katrina in my temple.,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,2814,"['director', 'script', 'writer', 'whom', 'are', 'same', 'way', 'have', 'done', 'brilliant', 'job', 'keeping', 'goings', 'true', 'title', 'movie', 'one', 'main', 'reason', 'four', 'characters', 'played', 'Katrina', 'Hrithink', 'Imran', 'Abhay', 'are', 'very', 'easily', 'relatable', 'fact', 'think', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'many', 'points', 'dilemmas', 'emotional', 'conflicts', 'go', 'are', 'ones', 'too', 'have', 'gone', 'points', 'lives', 'too', 'perhaps', 'need', 'discover', 'spirit', 'Katrina', 'charatcer', 'feel', 'enjoy', 'live', 'life', 'way', 'supposed', 'be', 'picturesque', 'sangunie', 'Spain', 'way', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'important', 'aspect', 'indeed', 'understand', 'why', 'three', 'men', 'feel', 'way', 'do', 'why', 'realise', 'Zindagi', 'Na', 'Milegi', 'Dobara.Katrina', 'once', 'again', 'proves', 'consummate', 'ease', 'why', 'best', 'actress', 'Bollywood', 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'only', 'Goddess', 'look', 'comfort', 'ease', 'carefree', 'character', 'retaining', 'feminine', 'appeal', 'times', 'lot', 'actining', 'abilities', 'scene', 'where', 'talking', 'three', 'musketeers', 'shots', 'vodka', 'case', 'point.The', 'cynicism', 'Indian', 'journalists/critics', 'who', 'are', 'generation', 'when', 'Indians', 'suffered', 'serious', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'abilities', 'everything', 'general', 'person', 'event', 'was', 'looked', 'doubt', 'suspicion', 'find', 'flaws', 'accent', 'acting', 'can', 'NOT', 'believe', 'can', 'be', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'have', 'who', 'impeccably', 'pretty', 'can', 'act', 'well', 'too', 'reminder', 'such', 'people', 'Not', 'everyone', 'who', 'amongst', 'humans', 'necessarily', 'human', 'are', 'too', 'needs', 'seriously', 'learn', 'Shah-rukh-Khan', 'tricks', 'self', 'promotion', 'media', 'manipulation', 'must', 'not', 'let', 'talent', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'due', 'poor', 'PR', 'brilliant', 'amazing.Kalki', 'was', 'only', 'sore', 'point', 'movie', 'felt', 'skipping', 'chapters', 'appeared', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'loose', 'continuity', 'goings', 'should', 'restrict', 'only', 'dark', 'with-an-ugly-under-belly', 'weird', 'kind', 'movies', 'dark', 'with-an-ugly-under-belly', 'weird', 'husband', 'produces.All', 'three', 'men', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showed', 'had', 'understood', 'imbibed', 'three', 'characters', 'well', 'cameras', 'started', 'rolling.Naseer', 'cameo', 'was', 'surprise', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'total', 'footage', '2', 'minutes', 'so', 'only', 'seasoned', 'born', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'convince', 'viewer', 'indeed', 'character', 'not', '300', 'films', 'old', 'veteran', 'who', 'imaginable', 'accolade', 'credit.This', 'movie', 'surely', 'place', 'collection', 'Katrina', 'temple']",Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara

1455747,A1H5E7O5BW2J13,B005DJDF2I,V.C.,"[4, 4]","This is one of the better Bollywood films I've seen, but it's by no means the best. What I did like about this movie was that the actors were handsome and very relaxed, relatable, and human, their acting wasn't over the top, their delivery was pretty chill and effective. The scenery of Spain is GORGEOUS, especially that sky diving scene, that was beautiful. My main gripe with Zindagi is really the plot. It's a little too simple and wears thin after the first hour with not much dramatic tension to keep things exciting. Sure there's the issue with the fiance getting jealous of the swimming instructor but it seemed a tad unnecessary and over the top for her to go all the way to Spain just to see ""what's going on"" for only one day only to return back home. There just wasn't enough drama for me, not that I wanted it to be a soap opera but most of the movie is basically where the characters are having a good time on vacation. It's nice and enjoyable, but doesn't make for an exciting 2 and a half hour movie. Overall though, this movie was GOOD, not great. It was def. worth watching and sitting through from start to finish.

1455748,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B005DJDF2I,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[1, 1]","OMG! If there was ever a movie that made the idea of a road- trip entiticing it's this one! I'm beyond joy with this one and getting my thoughts in order is incredibly hard because there is just so much emotion to work through. This is the most emotional ""guy"" movie I've ever seen without taking away any masculinity from the characters. Of course, as you can tell by my alias I'm a girl so masculinity isn't my area of expertice. HOWEVER I think I can safely say that my brother would like this movie if I could convince him subtitles aren't awful. He's a bit of a hillbilly so if he would think these guys are manly then they are.Where to start... okay when in doubt start with the obvious and work from there. Spain is AMAZING! It's always been on my bucket list and now wish I really could go. Indian film makers know how to capture fantastic scenery and Spain is captured in all it's natural sensual splendor. I love how even though it's beyond mortal comprehension of beauty it isn't pristine. It's hot, sometimes dusty, and you see that. The reality adds to the sensuality and you feel like you're there too. This isn't a fairy tale this movie is about finding where you belong in your life and friendship. Both subjects get a little messy so is the scenery at times and it works!Music: after Jodhaa Akbar this is my favorite Bollywood soundtrack ever!  It's so fresh and different but still retains the Hindi film cultural spirit. There isn't one dragging or loose song here. There all joyous uplifting and energizing they perfectly capture the theme that life is meant to be devoured and love in all forms savored. I could listen to it twenty-four-seven. I know that's a recognized form of torture but the songs are that wonderful. I love them all but the two most amazing are...""Khwabon Ke Parindey"" is a pure soulful love ballad that's as light as air. I'd play it at my wedding if I was getting married. The only thing I don't understand is why they dubbed Mr. Roshan's three lines when he was going to sing in his own voice anyway!Which is a perfect segway into ""Senorita."" Anyone who's a fan of Farhan Akhtar knows he's an accomplished singer and plays in his own band. Also ""Rock On"" was his baby so it's not surprising he would sing for himself. Mr. Roshan might be a bit of a shock to people who haven't seen ""Kites"" or ""Guzaarish"". Abhay Deol I've never really seen before and according to the special features he didn't enjoy singing but he did a fine job. Senorita is a perfect example of how no matter how culturally diverse humanity is there's always a universal constant where we mix perfectly. I'm not shocked that it's the ""superhit "" of the album.Performances: As I mentioned I've never seen Abhay Deol before so I have to say I'm more impressed than I thought I'd be. I mean just putting Farhan Akhtar an Hrithik Roshan is more than enough for a great film. But Mr. Deol has to hold the trio together in the first half and he does it brilliantly. All of the characters are deliciously human and messy and multi-layered. Kabir has amazing strength and crushing weaknesses and Mr. Deol wisely never overplayed either.Farhan Akhtar has hooked me as a very devoted fan. The first time he came to my attention was with ""Luck By Chance"" due to my determination to see every Hrithik Roshan movie ever made. And Mr. Akhtar made me so mad in that movie because I adored his character and he turned into the biggest Jackass! Well it doesn't take a genius to know he's good at his job because I was angry enough to almost skip ""Rock On"". Fortunately he didn't stay a jackass in that film and hooked me forever. Here he's a total doll and a bit of a harmless lecher. But underneath that charming funny exterior is a confused aching young man with wisdom beyond his years. His ability to observe life altering moments and put them into poetry adds so much depth that by the end of the film you're left feeling that he'll somehow change the world with his gifts. I hope that Mr. Akhtar has more oppertunities to play comedies they fit him like a good cashmere sweater.Just once I *wish* I could say Hrithik Roshan wasn't perfect. I do because I sound like a simpering teenager with a massive crush. Well I'm not a teenager and if I do have a crush it's with a publicity image because (God willing) I'll never meet the man! Alas that blasted man was indeed perfect! How perfect? He actually got to direct himself while lip-synching. Yeah I know, it's just too much! Arjun is a seriously screwed up cat but he's got good reasons. The poor man is trapped in a nightmere of materialism and pain and the worst part is he's oblivious to his situation. Still like a butterfly cracking it's cacoon he comes out of metamorphosis with a new lease on life. The best part is that the transition is handled gradually and very naturally. There's no one huge moment where the lightning strikes. It starts with a single step until one journey is over and a new one begins. Mr. Roshan does do some unusual things here. One, he doesn't cover his tatoos. No complaints there although tatoos aren't usually my cup of tea. Two, he gives the middle finger for a split second. In fairness Imram was being too mean, but my two yr old nephew won't be seeing this movie. The last thing I need is him learning that. Three Arjun and Laila sleep together. Sorry for the spoiler but parents should know these things. The scene isn't graphic in fact they're seen actually sleeping but it's clear more happened.I forgot to mention Imram also had an encounter but that's not shown either. Just a post chat with lady fully dressed in Hindi and Spanish. All in all it's very PG for the USA and it all turns out honorable I just won't say how.Ladies: First up, Laila! Katrina Kaif is a favorite of mine and I get the sense that when it comes to Bollywood fans you either love her or hate her. I love her. She's not the type of girl who is nervous about being silly or uninhibited she's a complete natural at playing sensitive, intelligent, strong-willed free spirits. The kind of girl I wish I was. She plays off of everyone brilliantly and she's my second favorite leading lady for Mr. Roshan. But I just have to say she doesn't do the kissing as well as Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Still if I can't have more of my favorite on-screen jodi Miss Kaif definitely has some serious sparks going for her with Mr. Roshan. Can't wait for the Hindi version of ""Knight and Day"" starring these two. Tom and Cameron who?Natasha played by Kalki Koechlin is pretty much everything irritating to me in another woman. I can't say much more about her without massive spoilers but I will say the actress did not wow me either.Cool stuff: the actors did all the sky diving and scuba diving themselves! The tomatoes action was as real as it gets. And most importantly the car worked!Direction and writing: Zoya Akhtar is so amazing as a director and storyteller. Her brother is no slouch either his dialogue is wonderful and if you get a chance to watch his own directorial efforts do so. It's amazing that this is only the second film Ms.  Akhtar directed. I can't wait for more.Why are you still reading this? Buy it! DVD quality is excellent but no subtitles for the deleted scenes.",5,BUY IT BUY IT NOW!
