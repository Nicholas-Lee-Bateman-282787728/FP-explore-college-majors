1635410,A11XYPHIJ6J85I,B00BLN4V2I,ThoMc,"[9, 9]","&#34;Lonesome Dove&#34; remains the lone standout TV western mini-series. However, that consisted of merely three episodes. For me the greatest TV western of all time is &#34;Rawhide.&#34;  Running to 217 episodes from mid-1958 to late 1965, the vast majority of the shows were solid starring a strong leading cast headed by Eric Fleming as trail boss and Clint Eastwood as ramrod. Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, Rocky Shahan, James Murdock and Robert Cabal provided able support. There were missteps by the suits at CBS and among the producers during the shakedown episodes and the legion of fans quickly let them know that the cattle drive and not the towns was the focus. I was one of those original fans who preferred the trail dust drifting over the wide open spaces for story action settings with the occasional brief stop for supplies at trail towns. Episodes in this mostly solid first half of season six provide that with a just a few of those annoying studio sound stage-attempting-to-duplicate-the-great-outdoor scenes. Still I recommend the series to everyone who loves a great western.",5,A Mostly Solid First Half of Season Six,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,1096,"['34', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', '34', 'lone', 'standout', 'TV', 'western', 'mini-series', 'However', 'consisted', 'merely', 'three', 'episodes', 'greatest', 'TV', 'western', 'time', '34', 'Rawhide.', '34', 'Running', '217', 'episodes', 'mid-1958', 'late', '1965', 'vast', 'majority', 'shows', 'were', 'solid', 'starring', 'strong', 'leading', 'cast', 'headed', 'Eric', 'Fleming', 'trail', 'boss', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'ramrod', 'Paul', 'Brinegar', 'Steve', 'Raines', 'Rocky', 'Shahan', 'James', 'Murdock', 'Robert', 'Cabal', 'provided', 'able', 'support', 'were', 'missteps', 'suits', 'CBS', 'producers', 'shakedown', 'episodes', 'legion', 'fans', 'quickly', 'let', 'know', 'cattle', 'drive', 'not', 'towns', 'was', 'focus', 'was', 'one', 'original', 'fans', 'who', 'preferred', 'trail', 'dust', 'drifting', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'story', 'action', 'settings', 'occasional', 'brief', 'stop', 'supplies', 'trail', 'towns', 'Episodes', 'mostly', 'solid', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'six', 'provide', 'just', 'few', 'annoying', 'studio', 'sound', 'stage-attempting-to-duplicate-the-great-outdoor', 'scenes', 'Still', 'recommend', 'series', 'everyone', 'who', 'great', 'western']",Rawhide: Season 6 - Volume One
