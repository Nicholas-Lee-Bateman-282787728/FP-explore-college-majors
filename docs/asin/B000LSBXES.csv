I found this DVD and the Get Celebrity Fit - Cardio DVD at Marshalls and decided to try it out. It was too easy, I didn't even break a sweat doing both workouts.

1040524,AJ9JBMZ6Z5483,B000LSBXES,Cassidy,"[2, 3]","I found this DVD to be too similar to TaeBo Cardio.  Although he does some dancing moves, he mostly does the same moves he does in TaeBo Cardio with much less explanation and he's moving much faster between moves in this one.  I found myself bored within the first 5 minutes.  It also seemed like Billy was just playing around a lot and the girl to his left kept having to tell him the right moves.  If you're not in shape, this may be challenging for you, but I was dissapointed to find this workout too similar to another one I already own.  Also, this is probably me being a nitpick, but Billy uses most of the same people in his Cardio workout, but I found that the outfits they wore in this one were not flattering.  It's like the outfits were too small and they made some of the girls look heavier and in not as good shape as they look in the Cardio video.",2,Dissapointed,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,862,"['found', 'DVD', 'be', 'too', 'similar', 'TaeBo', 'Cardio', 'dancing', 'moves', 'mostly', 'same', 'moves', 'TaeBo', 'Cardio', 'much', 'less', 'explanation', 'moving', 'much', 'faster', 'moves', 'one', 'found', 'bored', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'also', 'seemed', 'Billy', 'was', 'just', 'playing', 'around', 'lot', 'girl', 'left', 'kept', 'having', 'tell', 'right', 'moves', ""'re"", 'not', 'shape', 'may', 'be', 'challenging', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'find', 'workout', 'too', 'similar', 'one', 'already', 'own', 'Also', 'probably', 'being', 'nitpick', 'Billy', 'most', 'same', 'people', 'Cardio', 'workout', 'found', 'outfits', 'wore', 'one', 'were', 'not', 'flattering', 'outfits', 'were', 'too', 'small', 'made', 'girls', 'look', 'heavier', 'not', 'good', 'shape', 'look', 'Cardio', 'video']",N/A
1040525,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000LSBXES,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[4, 4]","""Billy Blanks' Tae Bo - Get Celebrity Fit - Sculpt"" starts out fast without the usual stretching.  The music moves quickly and Billy leads an exuberant group of familiar faces through the Tae Bo routines that have made him famous.  Some of the combination exercises do not go smoothly the first time out, but all in all, this 45 minute presentation reminds me of the excellent Tae Bo Live series (each segment was around 60 minutes so this Celebrity DVD is a little shorter in length but contains about as much cardio because the warm-up and cool-down are abbreviated) of about 10 years ago minus the popular music accompaniment.Personally, I miss hearing songs with which I can sing along--Billy needs to choose some better music--what he has selected just pretty much provides a beat; I'd like to get into the songs a little more.  Overall I think it would enhance the whole experience.Billy motivates wonderfully as usual--he does a little singing and dancing, but not too much to break the momentum as in the Tae Bo Ultimate offering.The DVD contains some additional material that teaches the fundamentals and a segment where Billy tells his success story.  This latter is very motivational.  I could not help but smile as Billy explained his dreams and the way in which he accomplished them. His honesty and sincerity depict a guy who legitimately loves what he does and gets excited when his techniques help others achieve their mission.Bottom Line?  This is a good workout to get the blood pumping in the AM. Its a little short, but it forgoes the longer warm-up and cool-down so most of the time is cardio-based.  For those who have enjoyed Tae Bo as I have throughout the years, this presentation delivers a quicker pace than some of Blanks' other series, like the 2004 Capture the Power grouping that seemed slow.

1040526,A26EQ8U96JA92T,B000LSBXES,Jody,"[3, 3]",I have 10+ Billy Blanks DVDs and many of them kick my bum.  I found Celebrity Sculpt to move to be more cardio based than sculpting based.  In the last 10 minutes it picked up with some fantastic sculpting/resistance moves but it made me feel like the first 35 minutes were wasted.  Billy moves rather quickly from one move to the next and doesn't spend enough time to really get your muscles tired in that move.  Personally I found myself spending more time trying to keep up and learn the routine than really focusing and burning muscles.

Instead it is all cardio---at a very fast pace.  I have been doing Billy's TaeBo tapes for the past 18 months.  I can get through his Elite and BootCamp workouts without stopping more than once.  I had to stop every 5-8 minutes to catch my breath during this workout.  It has some distracting parts where Billy trys to rap and he has the class do some dancing, but I was so busy focusing on doing the exercises at the super fast pace that it didn't bother me.  My husband, on the other hand, found the rap and dancing to be very funny.Overall, this is a great cardio workout, but if you are looking for strength-training type exercises I recommmend the Elite series (with the weighted bands) or the new Amped series (with the weighted bar).",4,Hard Cardio Workout---But Where's the Sculpting?,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,825,"['bought', 'video', 'impression', 'would', 'contain', 'sculpting', 'exercises', 'Instead', 'cardio', '-at', 'very', 'fast', 'pace', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'Billy', 'TaeBo', 'tapes', 'past', '18', 'months', 'can', 'get', 'Elite', 'BootCamp', 'workouts', 'stopping', 'more', 'once', 'had', 'stop', '5-8', 'minutes', 'catch', 'breath', 'workout', 'distracting', 'parts', 'where', 'Billy', 'rap', 'class', 'do', 'dancing', 'was', 'so', 'busy', 'focusing', 'doing', 'exercises', 'super', 'fast', 'pace', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'husband', 'other', 'hand', 'found', 'rap', 'dancing', 'be', 'very', 'funny.Overall', 'great', 'cardio', 'workout', 'are', 'looking', 'strength-training', 'type', 'exercises', 'recommmend', 'Elite', 'series', 'weighted', 'bands', 'new', 'Amped', 'series', 'weighted', 'bar']",N/A
