290312,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6302004446,Alex Udvary,"[5, 5]","""The Divorcee"" is a movie that risks a lot and rewards us with much more. The movie tackles some big issues in a most frank way, at least for 1930. Had the movie been made a few years later, we would have seen a vastly different picture.Most people have only heard of this movie, few have seen it. Film buffs have only know the movie as ""that one Norma Shearer won the Oscar for"". But it is a little more than that.The movie looks at double-standards in society. Jerry (Shearer) and Ted (Chester Morris) are young and in love. They surprise everyone at a pasrty when they announce they are going to be married. This news especially upsets Paul (Conrad Nagel) whom had planned to marry Jerry himself.Three years later, while celebrating their anniversary Jerry discovers that Ted had an affair, he assures her it was only once, but once is too many. He tries to talk her into understanding that it didn't mean anything, it's just the way men are. Ted then goes out of town on business.Jerry can't get her mind around Ted's confession, and so with the help of a mutual friend, Don (Robert Montgomery) the two paint the town red. But we then find out Jerry and Don had spent the night together. This is all revealed to Ted when he arrives home.Now the movie is about how these two people are going to cope with this information. Ted is outraged. How could his wife, whom he thought was respectable, committ such as act? After all, as Ted explained, he's a man, it's okay for him, but for a woman to act as a man does, unthinkable.This theme was pretty bold for a 1930's movie and as I said surprisingly tackles the issues as frank as possible. Their are however a few faults with the movie. First of all near the end of the movie it starts to lose its nerve. The issue is never really resolved between the two. This can lead one to then interpret the movie as saying absence makes the heart grow fonder. But the underlying dilemma confronting the two is never fully addressed head on. Given that a majority of the movie doesn't take this approach I found the ending disappointing.Shearer though was no stranger to acting in movie that dealt with controversial issues. ""Their Own Desire"", made a year ealier, also with Montgomery, had done it, and Shearer's ""The Women"" would also.The movie was directed by Robert Z Leonard, a studio director, who received an Academy Award nomination for this picture, had also directed Shearer in a Noel Coward adaptation called ""We Were Dancing"", with Melvyn Douglas. Leonard also directed ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Olivier and Greer Garson and a Myrna Loy comedy ""Third Finger, Left Hand"". So his name has been associated with entertaining films that took interesting views of society and in mild attempts challenged the norm.""The Divorcee"" will probably have the most entertainment value if watch by filmbuffs, though it doesn't have to be that way. The movie is boldly acted, and has some very convinving performances,. It is well-written and manages to get its point across by not being vulgar. It merely makes subtle hints. All of this lead the movie to earn four Oscar nominations for ""directing"", ""picture"", ""writing"" and ""actress (the only award it won)"". I don't mean to lessen the movie's worth, but it shold been seen as an example of what Hollywood could have been had there been no production code in effect. Try and think how different the entire history of movie might have been. That, if anything, should intrigue you to watch this. *** 1\2 out of *****.p.s. If you're interested in seeing amovie that deals with the issue of women's role in society played for comedy, track down the Kay Francis comedy ""Man Wanted"" which deals with women's place in the work force and what would happen if a man had a woman as a boss.Bottom-line: Well acted, well written early Hollywood melodrama that is way ahead of its time. Shearer and Montogery are quite good. Bold example of what the movies were once capable of.",3,The Gay Divorcee,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,3953,"['Divorcee', 'movie', 'lot', 'rewards', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'big', 'issues', 'most', 'frank', 'way', 'least', '1930', 'Had', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'vastly', 'different', 'picture.Most', 'people', 'have', 'only', 'heard', 'movie', 'few', 'have', 'seen', 'Film', 'buffs', 'have', 'only', 'know', 'movie', 'one', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'won', 'Oscar', 'little', 'more', 'that.The', 'movie', 'double-standards', 'society', 'Jerry', 'Shearer', 'Ted', 'Chester', 'Morris', 'are', 'young', 'love', 'surprise', 'everyone', 'pasrty', 'when', 'announce', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'married', 'news', 'especially', 'upsets', 'Paul', 'Conrad', 'Nagel', 'whom', 'had', 'planned', 'marry', 'Jerry', 'himself.Three', 'years', 'later', 'celebrating', 'anniversary', 'Jerry', 'discovers', 'Ted', 'had', 'affair', 'was', 'only', 'once', 'once', 'too', 'many', 'talk', 'understanding', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'just', 'way', 'men', 'are', 'Ted', 'then', 'town', 'business.Jerry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'mind', 'Ted', 'confession', 'so', 'help', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Don', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'two', 'paint', 'town', 'red', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'Jerry', 'Don', 'had', 'spent', 'night', 'together', 'revealed', 'Ted', 'when', 'movie', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'cope', 'information', 'Ted', 'outraged', 'How', 'could', 'wife', 'whom', 'thought', 'was', 'respectable', 'committ', 'such', 'act', 'Ted', 'explained', 'man', 'okay', 'woman', 'act', 'man', 'unthinkable.This', 'theme', 'was', 'pretty', 'bold', '1930', 'movie', 'said', 'surprisingly', 'issues', 'frank', 'possible', 'are', 'however', 'few', 'faults', 'movie', 'First', 'end', 'movie', 'lose', 'nerve', 'issue', 'never', 'really', 'resolved', 'two', 'can', 'lead', 'one', 'then', 'interpret', 'movie', 'saying', 'absence', 'heart', 'grow', 'fonder', 'underlying', 'dilemma', 'confronting', 'two', 'never', 'fully', 'addressed', 'head', 'Given', 'majority', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'approach', 'found', 'ending', 'disappointing.Shearer', 'was', 'stranger', 'acting', 'movie', 'dealt', 'controversial', 'issues', 'Own', 'Desire', 'made', 'year', 'ealier', 'also', 'Montgomery', 'had', 'done', 'Shearer', 'Women', 'would', 'also.The', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Z', 'Leonard', 'studio', 'director', 'who', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'picture', 'had', 'also', 'directed', 'Shearer', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'adaptation', 'called', 'Were', 'Dancing', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Leonard', 'also', 'directed', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Olivier', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'comedy', 'Third', 'Finger', 'Left', 'Hand', 'name', 'been', 'associated', 'entertaining', 'films', 'took', 'interesting', 'views', 'society', 'mild', 'attempts', 'challenged', 'norm', 'Divorcee', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'most', 'entertainment', 'value', 'watch', 'filmbuffs', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'way', 'movie', 'boldly', 'acted', 'very', 'convinving', 'performances', 'well-written', 'get', 'point', 'not', 'being', 'vulgar', 'merely', 'subtle', 'hints', 'lead', 'movie', 'earn', 'four', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'directing', 'picture', 'writing', 'actress', 'only', 'won', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'lessen', 'movie', 'worth', 'shold', 'been', 'seen', 'example', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'production', 'code', 'effect', 'Try', 'think', 'how', 'different', 'entire', 'history', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'anything', 'should', 'intrigue', 'watch', '***', '1\\2', '*****.p.s', ""'re"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'amovie', 'deals', 'issue', 'women', 'role', 'society', 'played', 'comedy', 'track', 'down', 'Kay', 'Francis', 'comedy', 'Man', 'Wanted', 'women', 'place', 'work', 'force', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'man', 'had', 'woman', 'boss.Bottom-line', 'Well', 'acted', 'well', 'written', 'early', 'Hollywood', 'melodrama', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'Shearer', 'Montogery', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Bold', 'example', 'what', 'movies', 'were', 'once', 'capable']",N/A

290314,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302004446,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","This VHS of THE DIVORCEE is dubbed from a clean print with few flaws and only one minor break. Audio is clear and distortion-free.Norma Shearer was a very pretty lady with regular features and an angular jaw-- there's a facial resemblance to Mary Astor or even Andie MacDowell. Despite her overwrought acting, this 1930 MGM film won Miss Shearer a Best Actress Oscar.It's a story that illustrates the male/female double standard. On their third anniversary, Jerry's husband Ted (Chester Morris) confesses he's been cheating on her with friend Janice (Mary Doran). Jerry (Shearer), who's known for ""thinking like a man,"" goes clubbing with dapper Don (Robert Montgomery) and they have a ""fling.""After Jerry triumphantly reveals that the ""score has been evened"" between them, petulant Ted sues for divorce. (What a hypocrite!)A secondary plotline involves Paul (Conrad Nagel), who's always loved Jerry. When he learned that Jerry was marrying his best friend Ted, Paul got drunk and wrecked his convertible. Front seat passenger Dorothy (Judith Wood) was facially disfigured in the accident, so Paul married her out of guilt. Now he wants to dump Dot because Jerry is available again. (Another creep!)This melodrama is the sort of picture that studios felt Depression Era audiences wanted to see-- well-dressed people of means who party in fancy clubs and have sumptuously furnished home and busy lives that are ultimately more out of control than in.One notable bit of trivia occurs at a private party in the very first scene. Paul, who's clearly intoxicated (we've yet to learn why) tunes a console radio until he finds music. As a Hot Dance version of ""Singin' in the Rain"" plays, Paul happily strums a ukulele. The scene progresses and this instrumental becomes background music that alternates with ""You Belong to Me."" Both of these Herb Nacio Brown compositions were later used in another MGM picture,SINGIN' IN THE RAIN(1952).",4,"""All men are fair game from now on!""",1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,1931,"['VHS', 'THE', 'DIVORCEE', 'dubbed', 'clean', 'print', 'few', 'flaws', 'only', 'one', 'minor', 'break', 'Audio', 'clear', 'distortion-free.Norma', 'Shearer', 'was', 'very', 'pretty', 'lady', 'regular', 'features', 'angular', 'jaw', 'facial', 'resemblance', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'even', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'overwrought', 'acting', '1930', 'MGM', 'film', 'won', 'Miss', 'Shearer', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar.It', 'story', 'male/female', 'double', 'standard', 'third', 'anniversary', 'Jerry', 'husband', 'Ted', 'Chester', 'Morris', 'been', 'cheating', 'friend', 'Janice', 'Mary', 'Doran', 'Jerry', 'Shearer', 'who', 'known', 'thinking', 'man', 'clubbing', 'dapper', 'Don', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'have', 'fling', 'Jerry', 'triumphantly', 'score', 'been', 'evened', 'petulant', 'Ted', 'sues', 'divorce', 'What', 'hypocrite', 'secondary', 'plotline', 'Paul', 'Conrad', 'Nagel', 'who', 'always', 'loved', 'Jerry', 'When', 'learned', 'Jerry', 'was', 'marrying', 'best', 'friend', 'Ted', 'Paul', 'got', 'drunk', 'wrecked', 'convertible', 'Front', 'seat', 'passenger', 'Dorothy', 'Judith', 'Wood', 'was', 'facially', 'disfigured', 'accident', 'so', 'Paul', 'married', 'out', 'guilt', 'Now', 'dump', 'Dot', 'Jerry', 'available', 'again', 'creep', 'melodrama', 'sort', 'picture', 'studios', 'felt', 'Depression', 'Era', 'audiences', 'wanted', 'see', 'well-dressed', 'people', 'means', 'who', 'party', 'fancy', 'clubs', 'have', 'sumptuously', 'furnished', 'home', 'busy', 'lives', 'are', 'ultimately', 'more', 'control', 'in.One', 'notable', 'bit', 'trivia', 'occurs', 'private', 'party', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'Paul', 'who', 'clearly', 'intoxicated', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'learn', 'why', 'console', 'radio', 'music', 'Hot', 'Dance', 'version', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'plays', 'Paul', 'happily', 'strums', 'ukulele', 'scene', 'instrumental', 'background', 'music', 'Belong', 'Me', 'Herb', 'Nacio', 'Brown', 'compositions', 'were', 'later', 'used', 'MGM', 'picture', 'SINGIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'RAIN', '1952']",N/A
290315,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302004446,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[23, 24]","THE DIVORCEE was created in the first wave of ""all talking pictures,"" an era in which directors, writers, and actors often struggled to find styles appropriate to the new technology.  At the time, it was hailed as a masterpiece of realism; today, however, it is a film more often discussed than actually seen, for there is no escaping the fact that the film is stylistically dated.  Even so, it remains a landmark of its era--and given its historical importance it should be seen by any one with a serious interest in the history of American cinema.The film is ""pre-code,"" which is to say that it was made during a handful of years in the early 1930s when Hollywood's self-censorship was more the subject of jokes than of reality, and THE DIVORCEE was among the first Hollywood talkies to openly address both female sexuality and the sexual double standard.  The story finds Jerry (Norma Shearer) and Ted (Chester Morris) happily married--but on their third anniversary Jerry discovers that Ted has been unfaithful, something that Ted dismisses with the words ""it doesn't mean a thing.""  Angry and hurt, Jerry responds by having a one night stand of her own--and then is astonished by Ted's hypocrisy when he declares that her infidelity ""isn't the same thing.""The same story has been told so often that today we take it for granted, but in 1930 it was extremely controversial, and the cast plays it out with considerable intensity.  Most notable is star Norma Shearer; although changing styles have left her sadly neglected, in her own era she was considered among the finest actresses on the screen and noted for her unusual beauty, memorable speaking voice, and tremendous star quality.  In THE DIVORCEE she gives it everything she has, and her power is such that most viewers will find she quickly transcends the stylistically dated aspects of both the film and her own performance.Over the years I've seen the film several times--most impressively on the big screen, where the larger than life performances seem considerably less affected--and I've enjoyed it quite a bit every time.  If you are interested in exploring early 1930s Hollywood films, you could do considerably worse than to begin with THE DIVORCEE, which was my own introduction to that film era.  If you are already interested in early 1930s film and have never seen it... this one belongs on your shelf, and no excuses.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,"A Neglected Landmark, More Often Discussed Than Seen",1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,2411,"['DIVORCEE', 'was', 'created', 'first', 'wave', 'talking', 'pictures', 'era', 'directors', 'writers', 'actors', 'often', 'struggled', 'find', 'styles', 'appropriate', 'new', 'technology', 'time', 'was', 'hailed', 'masterpiece', 'realism', 'today', 'however', 'film', 'more', 'often', 'discussed', 'actually', 'seen', 'escaping', 'fact', 'film', 'stylistically', 'dated', 'Even', 'so', 'landmark', 'era', 'given', 'historical', 'importance', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'serious', 'interest', 'history', 'American', 'cinema.The', 'film', 'pre-code', 'say', 'was', 'made', 'handful', 'years', 'early', '1930s', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'self-censorship', 'was', 'more', 'subject', 'jokes', 'reality', 'THE', 'DIVORCEE', 'was', 'first', 'Hollywood', 'talkies', 'openly', 'address', 'female', 'sexuality', 'sexual', 'double', 'standard', 'story', 'Jerry', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'Ted', 'Chester', 'Morris', 'happily', 'married', 'third', 'anniversary', 'Jerry', 'discovers', 'Ted', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'something', 'Ted', 'words', ""n't"", 'mean', 'thing', 'Angry', 'hurt', 'Jerry', 'having', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'own', 'then', 'astonished', 'Ted', 'hypocrisy', 'when', 'infidelity', ""n't"", 'same', 'thing', 'same', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'so', 'often', 'today', 'take', 'granted', '1930', 'was', 'extremely', 'controversial', 'cast', 'out', 'considerable', 'intensity', 'Most', 'notable', 'star', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'changing', 'styles', 'have', 'left', 'sadly', 'neglected', 'own', 'era', 'was', 'considered', 'finest', 'actresses', 'screen', 'noted', 'unusual', 'beauty', 'memorable', 'speaking', 'voice', 'tremendous', 'star', 'quality', 'DIVORCEE', 'everything', 'power', 'such', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'quickly', 'stylistically', 'dated', 'aspects', 'film', 'own', 'performance.Over', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'most', 'impressively', 'big', 'screen', 'where', 'larger', 'life', 'performances', 'seem', 'considerably', 'less', 'affected', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'are', 'interested', 'exploring', 'early', '1930s', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'could', 'do', 'considerably', 'worse', 'begin', 'THE', 'DIVORCEE', 'was', 'own', 'introduction', 'film', 'era', 'are', 'already', 'interested', 'early', '1930s', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'shelf', 'excuses.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Maybe if Shearer had had costars with more star wattage than Chester Morris and Robert Montgomery it would have been out long ago!  However everything else being equal, I wouldn't trade Morris and Montgomery for Gable and Leslie Howard!Each man is perfect in his part and Chester Morris, if you ask me, is a real find.  I sort of remember him in his vintage years, kind of a wsie-cracking Oscar Levant type, but hete he is sexy, rough, rather an animal, i.e., perfect casting opposite Norma Shearer, who always seemed to respond well to ""brutes"" and of course to give as good as she got.  I'm afraid Robert Montgomery just isn't up to her (and Chester's) brand of animal magnetism--not just yet--later on of course Robert Montgomery forged his own signature acting menace, revealing an iron hand behind a velvet glove.However THE DIVORCEE is primarily a showcase for Shearer, and her many fans, new and old, will revel in the way she picks herself up, dusts herself off, and starts all over again.  I can only imagine what a stir her acting must have caused in its day.  She's very powerful, and she does it all with facial expressions and the tiniest gestures of her long, lean body and the wonderfully expressive costumes the designers put her in.  Watch her as she pulls a bit of lint from her sleeve just as her husband delivers a crushing speech to her.

The movie pushes double entendres and seuxal situations to the limit but does it with astonishing taste and wit. You know what's going on but since the movie assumes you're an adult it doesn't spell it out for you.The beautiful Norma Shearer plays Jeri, a bold, tough girl who most of the audience immediately identifies with. She falls in love with Ted. Their relationship is wild, passionate and exciting. Jeri continues with her career after the marriage and that's swell with Ted. Then Ted messes up and has a drunken fling with a woman who's not even on Jeri's level. He excuses himself by saying that the fling ""doesn't mean a thing."" Jeri, is NOT mollified and in a cleverly shot scene she pays Ted back in kind. You see Jeri and Ted's best friend. We see a close up of Jeri's face. She looks burnt out, furious and totally unlike herself. She smiles at her husband's best friend and then a window shade is drawn and the lights go out. Next scene is Jeri looking very pale and tired walking into her front door. You know immediately where she's been and what's she's done.  When she tells Ted that she's settled their account it takes Ted a minute to figure out what she means but when he does the expression of horror and disallusionment on his face is done so well.Jeri and Ted divorce and both fling themselves into affairs in order to forget each other. A montage follows where all you see is Jerri's hand with the hands of various other men with snippets of voiced over racy dialouge. One memorable line is Jeri's response to a French lover, ""I dont speak French but I know that's not high blood pressure!""Finally, Jeri faces facts. She still loves Ted and he still loves her and she decides to get him back.

The sound in the film is rough, it is a film made on sound equipment that wasn't very good.  The actors also are confined to standing in the same spot and unable to move due to the crude machinery of the time.  Still, what a wonderful film and what the artists could do with even their limited resources.  Norma Shearer shows why she became a star and her Oscar awarded for this performance as well as A Free Soul is well deserved.  I couldn't watch this film as a child, it was almost impossible to see it on TV.  Pre-code films such as these has been out of circulation for years and weren't available.

290320,AAW58LG72PG7I,6302004446,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 1]","One of the most explosive films of the pre-code era is THE DIVORCEE.  The era of the silent films had just ended a year prior and Hollywood was still searching for a way to tie together the new medium of talking movies with the old philosophy of sexual double standards.  Norma Shearer won an Oscar for her role as Jerry, a woman who has been happily married to Ted (Chester Morris) for three years.  She discovers that he had been unfaithful.  When he tells her that the affair did not mean anything to him, she is angered enough to have a revenge affair with Ted's best friend Don (Robert Montgomery). Whereas he expected her to forgive his tryst, she was shocked to learn that he was not willing to forgive hers.Now this sort of double standard was quite controversial in its day and rarely explored on the screen, which might partly account for the notoriety that helped Shearer win an Oscar and the film itself to be nominated for Best Picture.  As we see the events following the double revelation, we acknowledge the stark reality of it all. Both spouses undergo years of self-torment, he with alcoholism, she with promiscuity. Shearer had to shed her image as the perennial goody-goody type to get this part.  Once she got it, her ability to emote both passion and pain in one tear eyed glance keeps the audience riveted. Chester Morris had the more challenging assignment. He had to continue to be the tough guy that the fans had come to expect, but he also had to show that beneath that square jaw and steely eyes was a heart riven in two. There are several key scenes, each of which points toward the regeneration of two lost souls. One of them occurs at the very end when Shearer's newest beau Paul(Conrad Nagel) tells his current wife that he wishes to divorce her to marry Shearer. Paul's wife had earlier been horribly disfigured in an auto accident for which he blames himself, thus setting up a huge guilt trip that she plays upon to keep him in their marriage. Shearer is right there in the room to hear her tell Paul that she still loves him, and this revelation resonates with her.  THE DIVORCEE is a melodrama, but of the kind that if were were to ring even an iota more true, then it could make that transcendental leap from melodrama to classic film drama.  There are more than a few times with scenes line that that it may have done so.",5,Infidelity Hurts: DIVORCEE Proves That,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,2360,"['One', 'most', 'explosive', 'films', 'pre-code', 'era', 'DIVORCEE', 'era', 'silent', 'films', 'had', 'just', 'ended', 'year', 'prior', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'still', 'searching', 'way', 'tie', 'together', 'new', 'medium', 'talking', 'movies', 'old', 'philosophy', 'sexual', 'double', 'standards', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Jerry', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'happily', 'married', 'Ted', 'Chester', 'Morris', 'three', 'years', 'had', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'When', 'affair', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'anything', 'angered', 'enough', 'have', 'revenge', 'affair', 'Ted', 'best', 'friend', 'Don', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'expected', 'forgive', 'tryst', 'was', 'shocked', 'learn', 'was', 'not', 'willing', 'forgive', 'hers.Now', 'sort', 'double', 'standard', 'was', 'quite', 'controversial', 'day', 'rarely', 'explored', 'screen', 'might', 'partly', 'account', 'notoriety', 'helped', 'Shearer', 'win', 'Oscar', 'film', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'see', 'events', 'following', 'double', 'revelation', 'acknowledge', 'stark', 'reality', 'spouses', 'undergo', 'years', 'self-torment', 'alcoholism', 'promiscuity', 'Shearer', 'had', 'shed', 'image', 'perennial', 'goody-goody', 'type', 'get', 'part', 'got', 'ability', 'emote', 'passion', 'pain', 'one', 'tear', 'eyed', 'glance', 'audience', 'riveted', 'Chester', 'Morris', 'had', 'more', 'challenging', 'assignment', 'had', 'continue', 'be', 'tough', 'guy', 'fans', 'had', 'come', 'expect', 'also', 'had', 'show', 'beneath', 'jaw', 'steely', 'eyes', 'was', 'heart', 'riven', 'two', 'are', 'several', 'key', 'scenes', 'points', 'regeneration', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'One', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'Shearer', 'newest', 'beau', 'Paul', 'Conrad', 'Nagel', 'current', 'wife', 'divorce', 'marry', 'Shearer', 'Paul', 'wife', 'had', 'earlier', 'been', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'auto', 'accident', 'thus', 'setting', 'up', 'huge', 'guilt', 'trip', 'keep', 'marriage', 'Shearer', 'right', 'there', 'room', 'hear', 'tell', 'Paul', 'still', 'revelation', 'DIVORCEE', 'melodrama', 'kind', 'were', 'were', 'ring', 'even', 'iota', 'more', 'true', 'then', 'could', 'make', 'transcendental', 'leap', 'melodrama', 'classic', 'film', 'drama', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'scenes', 'line', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'so']",N/A

Sherwin,"[3, 3]","(4.5 stars)The Divorc&eacute;e is an excellent early ""talkie"" from MGM that stars the incredible Norma Shearer with Chester Morris and a young Robert Montgomery. The acting is very well done although in a two or three brief spots it was a tad overdone; but this is relatively minor. The cinematography is quite good for its time; and the choreography works best in crowd scenes. The plot moves along at a very good pace--I was never once bored. The quality of the print is good, too.When the action starts, we quickly meet several principle members of the cast all gathered at a country home for a party before they return to their homes in New York City. Jerry (Norma Shearer) and Ted (Chester Morris) are madly in love and they want to be married soon--Ted can hardly wait as they spend time alone together by a brook. There's also Paul (Conrad Nagel) who loves Jerry although he knows she doesn't love him in return; and Judith Wood plays Dorothy (or, ""Dot""), the girl who loves Paul although, of course, Paul doesn't love her. Look also for Zelda Sears to give a fine performance as Hannah, Jerry's maid.When Jerry and Ted announce to the group their intentions of becoming married soon, Paul finally realizes in full that he will never have Jerry for himself--and he proceeds to get rather drunk. Dorothy's sister Mary (Helene Millard) suggests to Dorothy and Paul that he's too drunk to drive; but he drives with them all in the car anyway--and a horrible accident occurs that leaves Dorothy's face badly scarred. Paul marries Dorothy in her hospital bed because he feels guilty and he pities her; and Jerry and Ted are married in bliss.On their wedding anniversary, Jerry and Ted have a few people over; and one of them is Janice (Mary Doran), a woman Ted was alone with without telling Jerry! When Jerry finds out she is very upset despite the fact that Ted insists that ""it doesn't mean a thing."" However, when she ""squares their accounts"" by spending romantic time alone with Ted's friend Don (Robert Montgomery), Ted is crushed and he leaves Jerry. It seems that there IS a double standard after all! Their divorce soon becomes final; and Ted and Jerry each try to find new happiness with other partners.Will Ted and Jerry find happiness with new people in their lives? Dorothy says she's willing to give Don a divorce so that he could marry Jerry--but what unexpected problems could actually come out of that? Will Ted find a new woman--he certainly makes the rounds about town; and Jerry does the same, looking for rich men with the help of her friend Helen (Florence Eldridge). No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!The Divorc&eacute;e is quite a strong film that will grab your attention and never let go. The topic is still timely today. There are one or two extremely embarrassing, crude stereotypes but these incidents are thankfully very brief; I suppose this dates the film to some extent and that's a shame because otherwise everything is so brilliantly done. In the final analysis, this film remains a good selection for fans of Norma Shearer and the other actors in this movie.",5,"""I'm just trying to hang on to the marvelous latitude of the man's point of view...""",1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,3111,"['4.5', 'stars', 'Divorc', 'eacute', 'excellent', 'early', 'talkie', 'MGM', 'incredible', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'Chester', 'Morris', 'young', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'two', 'three', 'brief', 'spots', 'was', 'tad', 'overdone', 'relatively', 'minor', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'good', 'time', 'choreography', 'best', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'was', 'never', 'once', 'bored', 'quality', 'print', 'good', 'too.When', 'action', 'quickly', 'meet', 'several', 'principle', 'members', 'cast', 'gathered', 'country', 'home', 'party', 'return', 'homes', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Jerry', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'Ted', 'Chester', 'Morris', 'are', 'madly', 'love', 'want', 'be', 'married', 'soon', 'Ted', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'spend', 'time', 'alone', 'together', 'brook', 'also', 'Paul', 'Conrad', 'Nagel', 'who', 'Jerry', ""n't"", 'love', 'return', 'Judith', 'Wood', 'Dorothy', 'Dot', 'girl', 'who', 'Paul', 'course', 'Paul', ""n't"", 'love', 'Look', 'also', 'Zelda', 'Sears', 'give', 'fine', 'performance', 'Hannah', 'Jerry', 'maid.When', 'Jerry', 'Ted', 'announce', 'group', 'intentions', 'becoming', 'married', 'soon', 'Paul', 'finally', 'full', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'Jerry', 'get', 'rather', 'drunk', 'Dorothy', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Helene', 'Millard', 'Dorothy', 'Paul', 'too', 'drunk', 'drive', 'car', 'anyway', 'horrible', 'accident', 'Dorothy', 'face', 'badly', 'scarred', 'Paul', 'Dorothy', 'hospital', 'bed', 'guilty', 'Jerry', 'Ted', 'are', 'married', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'Jerry', 'Ted', 'have', 'few', 'people', 'one', 'Janice', 'Mary', 'Doran', 'woman', 'Ted', 'was', 'alone', 'telling', 'Jerry', 'When', 'Jerry', 'out', 'very', 'upset', 'fact', 'Ted', ""n't"", 'mean', 'thing', 'However', 'when', 'accounts', 'spending', 'romantic', 'time', 'alone', 'Ted', 'friend', 'Don', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'Ted', 'crushed', 'Jerry', 'double', 'standard', 'Their', 'divorce', 'soon', 'final', 'Ted', 'Jerry', 'try', 'find', 'new', 'happiness', 'other', 'partners.Will', 'Ted', 'Jerry', 'find', 'happiness', 'new', 'people', 'lives', 'Dorothy', 'willing', 'give', 'Don', 'divorce', 'so', 'could', 'marry', 'Jerry', 'what', 'unexpected', 'problems', 'could', 'actually', 'come', 'Will', 'Ted', 'find', 'new', 'woman', 'certainly', 'rounds', 'town', 'Jerry', 'same', 'looking', 'rich', 'men', 'help', 'friend', 'Helen', 'Florence', 'Eldridge', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'Divorc', 'eacute', 'quite', 'strong', 'film', 'will', 'grab', 'attention', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'topic', 'still', 'timely', 'today', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'extremely', 'embarrassing', 'crude', 'stereotypes', 'incidents', 'are', 'thankfully', 'very', 'brief', 'suppose', 'film', 'extent', 'shame', 'otherwise', 'everything', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'final', 'analysis', 'film', 'good', 'selection', 'fans', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'other', 'actors', 'movie']",N/A

Norma Shearer who today is sadly not well known really proved her acting chops in this vehicle and went home with the Best Actress Oscar that year for her troubles. Often labelled quite restrictively as the dignified first lady of MGM resulting from much of her later work in this decade in husband Irving Thalberg's prestige productions; here proves what she was capable of doing on screen when given meaty roles to tackle.
