1100072,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B000VAR0T8,Aion,"[3, 3]","This will be a short review since it's 5:30 AM and my memories of the first season aren't very fresh due to me having completed it a few weeks back. I suddenly felt like expressing my opinion about the series before my memories become too fuzzy, so...The story is simple: A guy (Keiichi) with bad luck has bad things happen to him constantly, a Goddess (Belldandy) takes pity on him, allowing him to have 1 wish and the guy rather bizarrely requests that the Goddess stays with him forever. From that point onwards the other main characters are slowly introduced, including characters such as Skuld; a young Goddess who wants all Belldandy's attention, and lots of comedy follows.Ah! My Goddess (AMG) is what I've come to call a 'circular series', and by that I mean it's the type that goes around in a seemingly endless circle of comedy episodes that advance the plot very slowly if at all. But, thankfully, that isn't a bad thing in the case of this series - The main characters are all likeable, the relationship between a wimp (Keiichi) and doormatt (Belldandy) is as entertaining as it is cute and the series clearly had a fairly high budget. You'll end up glad that Ah! My Goddess is the type of series that will continue until the money stops coming.AMG is a show that just about anyone from either gender should enjoy. It isn't a series for the sort of people who can't enjoy anything without blood and guts but I find it hard to imagine anyone else disliking it. If you want an easy to watch or a 'girlfriend friendly series' that's almost guaranteed to make time pass in an enjoyable manner then this most certainly is it.I've moved onto the 2nd season (although I've put it on hold for the moment) and I still enjoy watching it just as much as I did when I started. I highly recommend continuing the series with that once you get through the first season - It's a direct continuation of what you'll by then know is a high quality series.",4,Ah!

1100073,ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B000VAR0T8,"Amazon Customer ""space_hamster""","[3, 3]","A friend of mine introduced me to anime, and knowing that I hated ultra-violent series that are so popular amongst anime fans, recommended Ah! My Goddess instead. The series starts off incredibly slowly - the very first episode is entirely Keichii-centric. The pace picks up a little when Belldandy shows up. But the series really begins to take off when Belldandy's sisters - Urd and Skuld show up. It's about then that the series settles into a familiar formula - Urd tries to persuade Keichii to put the moves on Belldandy, Skuld tries to stop them, hilarity (and numerous explosions) ensues. It's a simplistic formula, but the characters have so much charm to them that it actually works very well.I have some minor caveats, which I think are particularly relevant to new viewers. Firstly, the series does take awhile to get up to speed and establish the characters, so be patient because the multi-episode wait is worth it. Secondly, for those used to female protaganists like Buffy Sommers, Belldandy is a major throwback to the 1950's. The character of Belldandy is most successful when she is interacting with other characters - particularly Urd and Skuld. When the focus was on Belldandy herself, the pace slowed down for me somewhat.Apart from that, this is a reasonably good series.",4,Pleasant anime romantic comedy,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,1293,"['friend', 'mine', 'introduced', 'anime', 'knowing', 'hated', 'ultra-violent', 'series', 'are', 'so', 'popular', 'amongst', 'anime', 'fans', 'recommended', 'Ah', 'Goddess', 'instead', 'series', 'incredibly', 'slowly', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'entirely', 'Keichii-centric', 'pace', 'up', 'little', 'when', 'Belldandy', 'up', 'series', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'when', 'Belldandy', 'sisters', 'Urd', 'Skuld', 'show', 'up', 'then', 'series', 'familiar', 'formula', 'Urd', 'persuade', 'Keichii', 'put', 'moves', 'Belldandy', 'Skuld', 'stop', 'hilarity', 'numerous', 'explosions', 'ensues', 'simplistic', 'formula', 'characters', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'charm', 'actually', 'very', 'well.I', 'have', 'minor', 'caveats', 'think', 'are', 'particularly', 'relevant', 'new', 'viewers', 'Firstly', 'series', 'take', 'awhile', 'get', 'up', 'speed', 'establish', 'characters', 'so', 'be', 'patient', 'multi-episode', 'wait', 'Secondly', 'used', 'female', 'protaganists', 'Buffy', 'Sommers', 'Belldandy', 'major', 'throwback', '1950', 'character', 'Belldandy', 'most', 'successful', 'when', 'interacting', 'other', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Urd', 'Skuld', 'When', 'focus', 'was', 'Belldandy', 'pace', 'slowed', 'down', 'somewhat.Apart', 'reasonably', 'good', 'series']","Ah!

1100078,A2Y47HN5IP85J,B000VAR0T8,M. Richardson,"[21, 21]","Back in the nineties, all fans of the Ah! My Goddess manga had was a short, very condensed five-episode OVA series. It was lovely, of course, and we would watch and love every second of it. And yet, there was a thirst that the short OVA couldn't quench (and neither could the excellent 2000 Ah! My Goddess film, even if it is still the single best piece of Ah! My Goddess media ever released): we knew this series deserved to be made into a TV series. Back then, the odds of this happening seemed slim. Thankfully, we were wrong.The TV series is everything we'd hoped for and more. This wasn't a rushed 13-episode project that'd only develop things slightly more than the previous OVA. This was (and is) a major, high-quality project. The series neither follows the manga completely faithfully nor veers off in some unknown direction: it takes the basic flow and material provided by the manga and fashions itself as its own creature.As far as the series goes:Visual: A fairly high-quality level of animation is maintained. The visual aspects of the film are maintained, so this and the film don't look that terribly different.Audio: Thankfully, unlike the OVA with its dinky BG music and simplistic J-POP, we get quite a few good tunes with this series. The first season opening is an excellent, Celtic-ish piece of soft rock. The ending is a cute, and, dare I say, slightly country-ish tune. The background music is not spectacular, but it accomplishes its job and, again, it is a far sight better than what was provided in the OVA.Extras: Sparse extras. Very little. Extras-fanatics will be disappointed; for people like me who merely want the show, though, this won't be a problem.All in All, a great show at a very affordable price. Highly recommended!If you've never seen any Ah! My Goddess, though, try to get your hands on the OVA first. If you like the OVA, you'll love the series.ONE POINT OF CAUTIONThe five stars above are for the show itself. I advise against keeping your DVDs in the case. The way it is designed makes it very tough to get the DVDs out. I've never had troubles with any of my other DVDs, but I actually snapped one of the discs in this collection trying to get it out, and had to order a new individual copy of that disc!

The story has the main character Keiichi Morisato a young male college student who seems to have the worst luck with money and women and because of his money problems lives in the auto club dorm rooms.  Than after a accidental phone call mistake he's connected to the goddesses hot line where he meets Belldandy a young goddess who tells him he gets one wish, and his wish turns out having Belldandy staying on earth at his side.  In no way is there anything to adult in this series it's actually pretty light-hearted with most of the romantic scenes so don't worry about younger kids watching this show.  Along the series Belldandy's two other sisters Urd and Skuld come to earth and later stay there.  The series has a mix of romance and humor but again don't worry to much about violence in the series the harshest you'll probably see is when two of the series characters are punished for their conniving ways and trying to get between Belldandy and Keiichi.  The series is widescreen format with clear and sharp picture quality so no need to worry about the picture.  The audio is also great the dubbed and subbed voice actors did a great job for their characters on the show.

1100081,A1JEHPPJ4475HP,B000VAR0T8,W. Watson,"[0, 0]","What can I say about Ah! My Goddess that hasn't already been said? I will say this. It's nice to see a story that has real heart and warmth. It's something that I think is missing from a lot of our own shows. People have criticized Keiichi and Belldandy as being a wimp and a doormat, but I just don't see it that way. Belldandy's status as a First Class Goddess is something that you should keep in mind as you watch this. That's Goddess First Class, Unlimited License. That means she's the example to which all other Goddesses aspire. I don't think that taking care of someone and finding the joy in the simple things of life makes you a doormat. I don't think that looking for the best in people even when they disappoint you makes you weak --I think that kind of character is something that could only exist in a Goddess First Class, Unlimited License.As for Keiichi, he's more than special too. He's that lovable underdog in all of us. This is a truly good young man in the way that he keeps his positive outlook in spite of all the hardships. He's not good with women --that's something that all of us have struggled with at some point. I think the reason I like his character is that I can identify with his problem. Sometimes all you need in order to make the most out of life is to have that important someone to stand by you and believe in you. You can see it as the series progresses, just what an affect having that kind of someone in your life can make. But even with that, it isn't automatic. You don't just get it once and then everything falls into place. His wish wasn't a selfish wish, it was a genuinely honest one. I think that's what she sees in him from the very beginning. Rather than wishing for wealth, or fame or anything materialistic, he wished for someone to stick by him that would believe in him. Who wouldn't fall in love with someone like that?The major problems with their relationship comes from the outside. I think that's the funniest thing about the show. The two come to love unexpectedly, but they are going at their own pace --even though it may seem slow to some; for the two of them it's absolutely right. Urd and Skuld are family, and like family they meddle even if it's with the best of intentions. It's zany and it's non violent for the most part and it's romantic. I really could spend two hours watching these with my daughter and not feel like its a chore. Sometimes I even sneak and preview an episode or two ahead after she's gone to sleep.The sexual tension is real, without going too overboard like a lot of other Anime. It's not too much and I don't think it tries to bash you over the head with it. The violence is minimal, and pertinent to the storyline. Bottom line is that I have no reservations about recommending this kind of Anime to my friends who want something different. I do a lot of watching of shows like this for my daughter because I'm tired of her watching the drivel that counts for shows for girls these days. This one has real heart.",5,I really liked this one.
