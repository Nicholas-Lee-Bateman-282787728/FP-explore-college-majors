1334032,A2AJY9JWL4P7L6,B0039USJBA,"Adam Martin ""redbaron1986""","[0, 3]","Let me start off by saying, I have seen just about every movie on World War One aviation. The Red Baron and Flyboys are the ones I enjoyed the most. I waited for this for nearly 4 years but it was well worth the wait. It starts off when he was kid and sees an airplane for the first time then takes off from there. It showed the relationship he had with his squadron and the people around him. The dogfights scenes are spectacular, especially the night flying scene. It was nice to see flying the red Albatros and Fokker DR1 airplanes. There can always be more of them though, you can never have too many ww1 aerial duels. The romance between him nurse Kate was a little overboard but not too bad. Manfred did have sense of humor, which was in the film. He also rode a bike from time to time. There is a picture of him doing so in the book Under The Guns Of The Red Baron. I don't think he ever met Roy Brown, but who knows? He probably didn't tell people everything he did either. It should have shown his last flight but with all the contreversey surrounding his death, it probably would have cost too much. With all the documentries such as: Who Killed The Red Baron, Red Baron and the Wings Of Death, Death of The Red Baron etc its all good. Like all history and biography movies it has  it's flaws, but all in all a great film. I have alot of Red Baron and WWI stuff so this is a great addition. If you are a WWI buff add it to your collection, it goes great with the ones I mentioned above, as well as Wings(1927),The Dawn Patrol, The Blue Max and others. Check it out!

Now he is so fascinated by the Red Baron, he is doing his own research and begs for anything having to do with von Richtofen and his plane!

I really enjoyed it and will be purchasing the film and the amazing soundtrack (score) if I can find it. (Hello Amazon?!) I will preface my review with being upfront that I don't know much of WWI aviation. A quick google search shows this movie to be decently accurate for Hollywood fare. I was looking forward to seeing Lena Heady (300) and Joseph Fiennes in the cast but it was Matthias Schweighofer who stole the movie for me. Besides being insanely good looking his acting was intense and subtle. I am very much surprised we haven't heard more of him here in the United States.The movie action wasn't over the top because while this is a WWI movie it also has a human element to it. The sets, costumes and decoration were beautifully done -- takes you to another era. Very top notch. The cinematography was stunning especially one of the final scenes of the trees. (If you liked Terrance Malick's the New World's look and feel this movie may be up your alley) The score was haunting and moving.Overall this movie strives to be more than just a guy's action flick or a chick flick with token flying scenes.

1334041,A30TQET02FLSUX,B0039USJBA,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 1]","The Red Baron (2008) just came out on Bluray recently and I wanted to see the film for the first time in this format since I could tell from the trailer that the movie was going to be very visually appealing. And it definitely lived up to that expectation!  The film is absolutely gorgeous in its cinematography.  The lighting is wonderful, the locations and sets are incredible, and the historic detail (whether accurate or not) takes you right back to the beginning of the 20th century.  Even the special effects are top notch, giving you the sense of flying through the air in WWI planes.  The casting was perfect in my opinion.  German actor Matthias Schweigh&ouml;fer lights up the screen and has an incredible magnetism to him in this role.  His smile and his emotions pull you in.  Apparently he also played a small role in Valkyrie (2008), Tom Cruise's WWII epic about the attempted German assassination of Adolf Hitler.  Another good movie by the way! Lena Headey from 300 (2006) plays the love interest for the Baron and her resistance to his charms is fun to watch. The costumes are really good in this flick as well, giving the ""war"" film an interesting feel that I wouldn't have expected.  I imagine the costumes are based in historical accuracy and that these fighter pilots didn't have the strict Nazi Uniform of WWII yet.While the movie is very good, I feel like something is missing from it.  Probably from a story standpoint.  I think the story didn't quite pull together all of the emotion and powerful acting that I felt and saw throughout the film.  The actors really made me feel their roles, but it was like it was for nothing...no cause.  Somehow, the WWI cause was just not giving enough story or context for me to have all of this emotion bump up against.  But I definitely want to watch this movie a second time before making my final rating on it.  But this movie is definitely worth viewing and appreciating simply for its cinematic qualities.  And considering it was not a Hollywood film, but a private German financed film, it's exciting to see this quality of ""independent"" work outside of the film capital of the world.",3,Missing Something...But Visually Stunning,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2152,"['Red', 'Baron', '2008', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'Bluray', 'recently', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'format', 'could', 'tell', 'trailer', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'visually', 'appealing', 'definitely', 'lived', 'up', 'expectation', 'film', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'lighting', 'wonderful', 'locations', 'sets', 'are', 'incredible', 'historic', 'detail', 'accurate', 'not', 'right', 'back', 'beginning', '20th', 'century', 'Even', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'giving', 'sense', 'flying', 'air', 'WWI', 'planes', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'opinion', 'German', 'actor', 'Matthias', 'Schweigh', 'ouml', 'fer', 'up', 'screen', 'incredible', 'magnetism', 'role', 'smile', 'emotions', 'pull', 'Apparently', 'also', 'played', 'small', 'role', 'Valkyrie', '2008', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'WWII', 'epic', 'attempted', 'German', 'assassination', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'good', 'movie', 'way', 'Lena', 'Headey', '300', '2006', 'love', 'interest', 'Baron', 'resistance', 'charms', 'fun', 'watch', 'costumes', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'flick', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'war', 'film', 'interesting', 'feel', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'expected', 'imagine', 'costumes', 'are', 'based', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'strict', 'Nazi', 'Uniform', 'WWII', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'feel', 'something', 'missing', 'Probably', 'story', 'standpoint', 'think', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'together', 'emotion', 'powerful', 'acting', 'felt', 'saw', 'film', 'actors', 'really', 'made', 'feel', 'roles', 'was', 'was', 'nothing', 'cause', 'Somehow', 'WWI', 'cause', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'giving', 'enough', 'story', 'context', 'have', 'emotion', 'bump', 'up', 'definitely', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'making', 'final', 'rating', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'appreciating', 'simply', 'cinematic', 'qualities', 'considering', 'was', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'private', 'German', 'financed', 'film', 'exciting', 'see', 'quality', 'independent', 'work', 'film', 'capital', 'world']",N/A

I'm referring to the aerial battle between a solitary Werner Voss and the whole cream of the crop of the British Air Service.

1334046,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,B0039USJBA,D. Blankenship,"[1, 1]","Needless to say this film is not a historical accurate documentary; far from it.  History buffs will groan and cringe a bit when they watch this one as I am not at all sure if the producers even got many of the dates correct.  On the other hand, they did a pretty good job in recreating the planes.But that is okay.  Films of WWI are my nature extremely depressing for me personally.  This is because WWI (And any war for that matter) is depressing.  Of all the wars I have studied though, with the possible exception of our own Civil War, WWI is, for me, more depressing than all the others; everything was so senseless and from the hindsight of history we know that all that loss and human suffering only led to an even greater tragedy a few years down the road. So many lives shattered, and for no good reason.But I digress....I did enjoy watching this particular film because I have a lot of little boy in me and the digital work with the air battles in this film made it worth watching.  Was it real?  Of course not, but to be honest I did not watch it for the realism but rather the fantasy.  The computer folks did a fine job on this one.The other aspect of the film I found nice was the long gone ""nicety"" displayed by the men who were trying their best to kill each other.  I thought the film brought out how different morals, manners and overall outlook have changed from that era to the one we presently live it.The producers of course brought in a love interest as all producers do and it was tastefully done even if rather gratuitous and unnecessary to make a great film...and a great film this could have been if the writers had simply stuck to the facts.This is a nice film to watch in the wee hours of the morning with the dogs in your lap.  It held my interest if not educating me in the least.I am giving this one four stars simply for the digital work.  As to the acting, I thought it was a bit flat and no one actor (unless it was the young lady who played the nurse and the Baron's girl friend is considered) stood out.

1334048,A3JVLSWJ9629TD,B0039USJBA,D. Madsen,"[3, 3]","(Spoilers ahead.)  Five stars for the costumes and scenery.  Three stars for the film itself.  This film really had so much potential to be a great movie on the highest scoring ace of World War I.  In the end, it degenerated into a tale about a young man who only wants peace and an end to war, his heart turned by a love affair with his nurse.WHAT??  This was Baron Manfred von Richthofen?  The truth: he was a Prussian aristocrat who was a cavalry officer before he joined the air corps.  His father was a Prussian aristocrat and an army officer.  The Red Baron was the poster boy for the war effort and lionized by the public.  The fact and fiction are put together so that the truth becomes blurred.  I am the first to say film is art, and art can go into abstraction, but this is abstraction to the extreme.  They have turned the fighting ace--the Red Battle Flyer--into a loverboy and peacenik.Many things are delightfully recognizable:  there is ace pilot Verner Voss, a close friend of Richthofen, but he is not portayed as Jewish.  (It it often held that Verner Voss was Jewish.)  The role of the Jewish pilot is given off to some other minor character who is killed off.  (Voss, BTW, was killed in his triplane and not an Albatros--with a mustached face painted on the cowling.)  There is Richthofen's family:  the father and mother (Baron Albrecht--unbearded--and Baroness Kunegunde), the sister Ilse as an army nurse, and (I think) the youngest brother Karl Bolko.  Even the Baron's dog Moritz makes an appearance, albeit as a German Wirehaired Pointer and not a Great Dane.  Would it have been that hard to hire a trained Great Dane for the movie?  The middle brother Lothar, also an ace in his own right, is given script prominence as a blood-thirsty combat pilot strutting about with his riding crop.Matthias Schweighofer does an admirable job playing the Baron with conviction, but he is far too tall to be a convincing Richthofen with his statuesque height and tousled blond hair.  (The real Baron was quite short; photos show him almost the same height as nurse Katie.)The costuming and sets show marvelous research and detail: the uniforms and flying kit of the combat pilots on both the Allied and Central sides, for instance.  Exact photos can be referenced to some scenes:  an Albatros biplane with a white Edelweiss flower (actually the plane of ace/dentist Paul Baumer, who does not appear in the film), the Baron's turtleneck sweaters, and even the Geschwaderstock, the squadron walking stick.  The Baron, after his head injury, is shown with his jaw wired shut and nursed by Katie Odersdorf (the real nurse Katie is spun into his love interest, eventually being seduced in an aerodrome tent, of all places!); in truth, it was Lothar who had his jaw wired shut after he was injured in a flying accident.The flying scenes in CG images is engaging and entertaining.With all of the painstaking research given to this film, why the melodrama?  I guess this is an entertaining film, but for fans of history and Manfred von Richthofen, the man, it's a disappointment.  So much more could have been made of this pioneer of air combat.  Some of his ideas are still taught at dogfighting schools such as Top Gun.  He was also an innovator in combat aircraft design, working with engineers on a three-wing design after a captured Sopwith triplane.  (Both Fokker and  Pfalz were in the running.)I kept waiting for aeronautical engineer Anthony Fokker to show up.",5,Some fact and some fiction--blended together,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,3476,"['Spoilers', 'ahead', 'Five', 'stars', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'Three', 'stars', 'film', 'film', 'really', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'highest', 'scoring', 'ace', 'World', 'War', 'end', 'degenerated', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'peace', 'end', 'war', 'heart', 'turned', 'love', 'affair', 'nurse.WHAT', 'was', 'Baron', 'Manfred', 'von', 'Richthofen', 'truth', 'was', 'Prussian', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'was', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'joined', 'air', 'corps', 'father', 'was', 'Prussian', 'aristocrat', 'army', 'officer', 'Red', 'Baron', 'was', 'poster', 'boy', 'war', 'effort', 'lionized', 'public', 'fact', 'fiction', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'so', 'truth', 'blurred', 'am', 'first', 'say', 'film', 'art', 'art', 'can', 'go', 'abstraction', 'abstraction', 'extreme', 'have', 'turned', 'fighting', 'ace', 'Red', 'Battle', 'Flyer', 'loverboy', 'peacenik.Many', 'things', 'are', 'delightfully', 'recognizable', 'ace', 'pilot', 'Verner', 'Voss', 'close', 'friend', 'Richthofen', 'not', 'portayed', 'Jewish', 'often', 'held', 'Verner', 'Voss', 'was', 'Jewish', 'role', 'Jewish', 'pilot', 'given', 'off', 'other', 'minor', 'character', 'who', 'killed', 'off', 'Voss', 'BTW', 'was', 'killed', 'triplane', 'not', 'Albatros', 'mustached', 'face', 'painted', 'cowling', 'Richthofen', 'family', 'father', 'mother', 'Baron', 'Albrecht', 'unbearded', 'Baroness', 'Kunegunde', 'sister', 'Ilse', 'army', 'nurse', 'think', 'youngest', 'brother', 'Karl', 'Bolko', 'Even', 'Baron', 'dog', 'Moritz', 'appearance', 'albeit', 'German', 'Wirehaired', 'Pointer', 'not', 'Great', 'Dane', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'hire', 'trained', 'Great', 'Dane', 'movie', 'middle', 'brother', 'Lothar', 'also', 'ace', 'own', 'right', 'given', 'script', 'prominence', 'blood-thirsty', 'combat', 'pilot', 'strutting', 'riding', 'crop.Matthias', 'Schweighofer', 'admirable', 'job', 'playing', 'Baron', 'conviction', 'far', 'too', 'tall', 'be', 'convincing', 'Richthofen', 'statuesque', 'height', 'tousled', 'blond', 'hair', 'real', 'Baron', 'was', 'quite', 'short', 'photos', 'show', 'almost', 'same', 'height', 'nurse', 'Katie', 'costuming', 'sets', 'show', 'marvelous', 'research', 'detail', 'uniforms', 'flying', 'kit', 'combat', 'pilots', 'Allied', 'Central', 'sides', 'instance', 'Exact', 'photos', 'can', 'be', 'referenced', 'scenes', 'Albatros', 'biplane', 'white', 'Edelweiss', 'flower', 'actually', 'plane', 'ace/dentist', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'who', 'not', 'appear', 'film', 'Baron', 'turtleneck', 'sweaters', 'even', 'Geschwaderstock', 'squadron', 'walking', 'stick', 'Baron', 'head', 'injury', 'shown', 'jaw', 'wired', 'shut', 'nursed', 'Katie', 'Odersdorf', 'real', 'nurse', 'Katie', 'spun', 'love', 'interest', 'eventually', 'being', 'seduced', 'aerodrome', 'tent', 'places', 'truth', 'was', 'Lothar', 'who', 'had', 'jaw', 'wired', 'shut', 'was', 'injured', 'flying', 'accident.The', 'flying', 'scenes', 'CG', 'images', 'engaging', 'entertaining.With', 'painstaking', 'research', 'given', 'film', 'why', 'melodrama', 'guess', 'entertaining', 'film', 'fans', 'history', 'Manfred', 'von', 'Richthofen', 'man', 'disappointment', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'pioneer', 'air', 'combat', 'ideas', 'are', 'still', 'taught', 'dogfighting', 'schools', 'such', 'Top', 'Gun', 'was', 'also', 'innovator', 'combat', 'aircraft', 'design', 'working', 'engineers', 'three-wing', 'design', 'captured', 'Sopwith', 'triplane', 'Fokker', 'Pfalz', 'were', 'running', 'kept', 'waiting', 'aeronautical', 'engineer', 'Anthony', 'Fokker', 'show', 'up']",N/A

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 4]","THE RED BARON (2008, 106 minutes) starring that incredible German cutie Matthias Schweigh&ouml;fer (a/k/a Schweighoefer,Valkyriesee my review) in the title role (before he landed his sad little cameo in VALKYRIE), and Lena Headey as Kate, the nurse who stole the Baron's heart - this was a widely hyped film I did not get to see until recently.These types of films are always difficult to review. Poor Matthias almost lost this role to Val Kilmer. I know next to nothing about World War I - never was much interested as others seemed to be - but this film is the ""dogfight"" film of all time. The effects and cinematography are stunning, the aerial battles thrilling. To me it seems a drastic waste.Schweigh&ouml;fer's acting - along with the others, who are splendid - it all seems wasted. This film is a silly patchwork that presumes the viewer's total knowledge of World War I fighter pilots. My wife said the script sounded as if a college kid had written it (not a compliment). The thick accents (Schweigh&ouml;fer's was the clearest) made me angry this wasn't filmed entirely in German and French. The sound was atrocious and the music was so ridiculously modern it was funny in an unfortunate way.The appearance of Joseph Fiennes in a cameo (as Canadian Captain Brown, the dude who always took credit for shooting down the Baron) is a pleasant surprise, but it is another example of how these things in themselves can do nothing to help such a film.To me it seems Manfred, Baron von Richthoven, The Red Baron, deserved better treatment than this. He was a brave man, a fine pilot who served his country until he'd had enough of playing wartime poster boy. He laughed about the pilots he shot down until suddenly, one day, he saw the slaughterhouse he'd helped create. He tried in his own way to foster some manner of peace until being shot down aged 25.Such a story deserves much better treatment than a bunch of thrilling dogfights and exploding dirigibles. The only touching moment aside from that brought on by the excellent acting was during the end credits, when photos were shown of the real men who had just been portrayed. (The text, which tells a bit about each man, is so tiny on television that I wonder why it isn't modified for television along with the film it is supposed to enhance.)I cannot tell you to avoid this uneven and slightly weird film: it is important and it might whet your appetite for serious learning.

1334054,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0039USJBA,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","THE RED BARON, a film about won of aviation's greatest figures, barely gets off the tarmac.  Written and directed by Nikolai M&uuml;llersch&ouml;n it seems to have good intentions - sharing the very brief life of Manfred von Richtohofen (2 May 1892 - 21 April 1918) historically known as the' Red Baron' who was a German fighter pilot with the Luftstreitkr&auml;fte during World War I, having the record of 80 air combat victories. The unique aspect of von Richthofen's career was the fact that he was admired by all fliers for his unique strategies and flying acrobatics while having as his goal the downing of enemy aircraft rather than the killing of men.The presentation of the film in segments, each labeled with a place and date, makes this film seem almost documentary in nature, and perhaps that excuses the presence of one of the weakest scripts to it the screen.  The dialogue is stilted and silly, leaving very little room for character development.  Another problem with the film is the casting of Matthias Schweigh&ouml;fer as the Red Baron.  He lacks chemistry with almost everyone else on the screen, most of all the ludicrous 'love affair' he has with  nurse K&auml;te Otersdorf (Lena Headey).  The cast does include two fine actors - Til Schweiger and Joseph Fiennes (the Canadian flier with whom the Red Baron has as interesting a relationship as  with anyone else in the story) and the actors in the smaller roles deliver acceptable performances given the script form which they must create.The film begins to be interesting  (outside of some acceptable aerial photography) when the Red Baron discovers he is being used as a propaganda pawn for the Germans, a fact he loathes and actually seems to live up to his reputation for being not only clever and skilled but also compassionate. Thee are the things of which legends are made, and legends always provide fodder for the movies.

As a aviation buff for the last 40 years i know that this film ranks one of the worst about the first world war and one of the worst about Von Richthofen himself. As i said in many other forms it seems that Hollywood or other film studios around the world has to have a love intrest in any and all films because of the females seeing movies and all that crap , blah blah. Well not all films need a woman in it or the remakes , because of past history (Remake of Rollerball , Flight of the Phoenix as examples) bombed in a film that has almost NO females in it. And like this mess destroys the story of one of the most writing about figures in the pass 100 years. The baron NEVER had a love intrest in his military career , and he NEVER violated any orders from HQ , bent the rules a little but never out and out disobeyed orders , he was to much a pro for that conduct. The nurse as we seen in the photos of during the war when he was wounded was nothing like this girl and she was a bit older , so it also destroyed any fact with the original nurse as well , as making his brother Lothar a total ass , which he WASNT , he was a brash and head strong fighter pilot and a great ace as well , but he was respected by his men and at times took over the Jasta when his brother was away. This Roy Brown BS is what it is bull$h!+ , the Baron never shot down Brown , and thou he was credited for shooting the Baron down , they never met , EVER. And the same goes for Hawker , who he shot down for this 11th victory and NEVER knew who he was til a day or so later. This writer should have his head checked for a bullet hole instead of Richtofen , because his brain must of leaked out. Horrible story and total unnessary events in his last couple of years. The movie ranks worst than Flyboys , the Blue Max and Richtofen  and Brown , Malcolm McDowell in Aces High or that piece of trash C movie of Mickey Rooney's Revenge of the Red Baron.Looks like i'll have to wait for another 10 or so years before someone tried to make another WW1 flying flick with a little more truthfulness to the story , unlike the latest Red Tails that bombed big time for WW2. Seems nobody can get it right , Pearl Harbor , the Flying Tigers , Bah Bah Black Sheep ... ect.Maybe i should stay on the ground for WW1 , i would be better off.

1334059,A245AST0T0AZTJ,B0039USJBA,J. Lindner,"[2, 4]","I've said it before in my reviews and I'll say it again here, don't get your history from Hollywood.  Hollywood is in the entertainment business and not the education field.  The Red Baron is a classic example of a movie that is allegedly based on fact.  The fact that this movie wasn't even made in Hollywood doesn't change the fact that is meant for entertainment purposes only.  This film is loosely based on Manfred VPN Richtoven's amazing life as a World War One flying ace, but that is about where fact leaves off and fiction begins.Von Richtoven is depicted in this movie as a caring noble pilot who seems more a victim of circumstance rather than the calculating killer he really was.  When I say calculating killer I do not mean to further the myth of imperial German militarism or make the Germans to be the bloodthirtsty monsters history has labeled them.  Instead I mean that von Richtoven had one choice when in the air, shoot down others before they shot him down.  The life expectancy of a First World War pilot was measured in days, not months or years.  The fact that Von Richtoven lasted as long as he did is testimony to his ability to kill when he needed to kill.  This movie fails completely to put him in that kind of context.  Rather it makes him to be a celebrity (which he was) making the best of a bad situation (which he probably did) while trying to be compassionate (which he wasn't).I give this film three stars not because of the storyline, which is weak, or the acting, which is mediocre, but because of the aerial dogfight scenes, which as quite entertaining.  The fight scenes puts the perspective of the pilots in context for those of us who were not there.  Compared to The Blue Max, The Red Baron shows how technology has changed so that virtually anything is possible with special effects.  For the fight scenes alone this movie is worth watching, especially if you watch it on Netflix.  I do not recommend buying it, there are too many reasons not to.  But watch it and you will appreciate what the pilots went through.  Then you may begin to realise how difficult their role was.  Then, if you are intrigued to learn more, get a book on the Red Baron or the air war in general.This movie is a German production that was done in English.  I've read that the intent was to tap the American market.  Unfortunately for the film's producers, there is little such market even if the main character is portrayed as the king of person we would relate with.  The net result was an indifferent American audience and an uncaring German audience.  Perhaps the producers learned one of those counterintuitive lesson, how not to make a movie.",3,The Red Baron,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,2668,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', 'business', 'not', 'education', 'field', 'Red', 'Baron', 'classic', 'example', 'movie', 'allegedly', 'based', 'fact', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'made', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'meant', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'only', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'Manfred', 'VPN', 'Richtoven', 'amazing', 'life', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'flying', 'ace', 'where', 'fact', 'fiction', 'begins.Von', 'Richtoven', 'depicted', 'movie', 'caring', 'noble', 'pilot', 'who', 'more', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'rather', 'calculating', 'killer', 'really', 'was', 'When', 'say', 'calculating', 'killer', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'further', 'myth', 'imperial', 'German', 'militarism', 'make', 'Germans', 'be', 'bloodthirtsty', 'monsters', 'history', 'labeled', 'Instead', 'mean', 'von', 'Richtoven', 'had', 'one', 'choice', 'when', 'air', 'shoot', 'down', 'others', 'shot', 'down', 'life', 'expectancy', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'pilot', 'was', 'measured', 'days', 'not', 'months', 'years', 'fact', 'Von', 'Richtoven', 'lasted', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'testimony', 'ability', 'kill', 'when', 'needed', 'kill', 'movie', 'completely', 'put', 'kind', 'context', 'be', 'celebrity', 'was', 'making', 'best', 'bad', 'situation', 'probably', 'did', 'trying', 'be', 'compassionate', 'was', ""n't"", '.I', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'not', 'storyline', 'weak', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'aerial', 'dogfight', 'scenes', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'fight', 'scenes', 'perspective', 'pilots', 'context', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'there', 'Compared', 'Blue', 'Max', 'Red', 'Baron', 'how', 'technology', 'changed', 'so', 'virtually', 'anything', 'possible', 'special', 'effects', 'fight', 'alone', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'watch', 'Netflix', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'buying', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'reasons', 'not', 'watch', 'will', 'appreciate', 'what', 'pilots', 'went', 'Then', 'may', 'begin', 'realise', 'how', 'difficult', 'role', 'was', 'Then', 'are', 'intrigued', 'learn', 'more', 'get', 'book', 'Red', 'Baron', 'air', 'war', 'general.This', 'movie', 'German', 'production', 'was', 'done', 'English', ""'ve"", 'read', 'intent', 'was', 'tap', 'American', 'market', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'producers', 'little', 'such', 'market', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'portrayed', 'king', 'person', 'would', 'relate', 'net', 'result', 'was', 'indifferent', 'American', 'audience', 'uncaring', 'German', 'audience', 'Perhaps', 'producers', 'learned', 'one', 'counterintuitive', 'lesson', 'how', 'not', 'make', 'movie']",N/A

When I was 12, my parents took my brother and me to see the then-acclaimed ""Midway"" with Charlton Heston in 1977.  I enjoyed the movie, but enjoyed more pointing out to my parents and brother the facts the movie got right and those it didn't.  Whenever I see a war movie, I'm usually critical about the facts not depicted correctly.  As many reviewers here have pointed out, ""The Red Baron"" takes many liberties with the facts and when I started watching it, I proverbially sighed and thought this was an opportunity wasted.  However, I became increasingly engrossed in the film as it progressed.  I suspect many will disagree with me, especially the aviation history aficionados, but I have to say this is an interesting and entertaining film that captures the spirit of WWI combat aviation even as it takes many liberal liberties with the facts.  It accurately depicts how the early WWI pilots valued chivalry and saw their war as a sport, not the bloody combat it was, and how as the war progressed, the reality of war became increasingly clear to the pilots.  Manfred von Richthofen is accurately portrayed in the beginning as interested in nothing else but shooting down his prey.  Although it is unclear whether von Richthofen actually harbored the same doubts as in the movie as the war progressed, this motif accurately captures the grimness of war.  The aerial combat scenes were well-done and are the centerpiece of the film, and show the potential of CGI and hopefully more WWI and WWII aviation movies will build on this promise.  I was completely captivated by all the aviation combat scenes, as well as the opener in which Richthofen and his comrades ""attend"" the funeral of a British fighter pilot in their aircraft and drop a wreath, somewhat incredibly, into the pilot's grave.  I'm particularly impressed with the accuracy of the Albatros and Fokker Triplane fighter recreations.  Although the movie spliced the many historical figures into fictional relationships--the great fighter ace Werner Voss was a friendly rival of Richthofen's, but never a close comrade as depicted in the film; Lanoe Hawker never flew a Royal Aircraft SE-5 as it appeared well after his death--I was impressed that almost all the major characters were correctly named after their historical prototypes.Yes, the movie twists the facts around greatly--the fictionalized scenes with Roy Brown, the RFC pilot who was initially credited with shooting down von Richthofen before facts showed the ace was downed by ground fire, will make many historians gag.  I can immediately count at least 10 facts the film morphs into fiction.  I also have to comment on one other aspect of the movie.  I thought the producers admirably included a Jewish German fighter pilot as one of Richthofen's close comrades and the movie noted at the end that this pilot never existed, but was instead a composite for the real Jewish German fighter pilots who flew in WWI.  The producers lost an opportunity here, though, in completely neglecting to depict Werner Voss's Jewish ancestry.  They could have depicted Voss's Jewish heritage instead of creating a fictional pilot.  However, if one looks at this movie as a novelized bio-pic of Manfred von Richtehofen, this is an engaging and enjoyable dramatization, marred only by the clumsy intimate scenes between Richthofen and Kate, the nurse who in real life only helped care for the ace after his head wound and remained a friend, but did not have a romance with him.  At least one German WWII fighter pilot wrote a novelized version of his autobiography--Gunther Bloemertz with ""Heaven Next Stop""; Bloemertz was a fighter pilot with JG 26--and it was well-received in Germany and worldwide, eventually translated into several languages and incurring several orders.  I think ""The Red Baron"" can be viewed similarly.  I recommend this film for those who are interested in a period WWI aviation film and who can appreciate the spirit beyond the facts.  The movie is worth seeing for the aviation scenes alone.  Admittedly, those who demand historical accuracy will proverbially gag if they view this movie.",4,short on facts but true on spirit,1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,4193,"['have', 'been', 'WWI', 'WWII', 'aviation', 'buff', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'When', 'was', '12', 'parents', 'took', 'brother', 'see', 'then-acclaimed', 'Midway', 'Charlton', 'Heston', '1977', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'pointing', 'parents', 'brother', 'facts', 'movie', 'got', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'Whenever', 'see', 'war', 'movie', ""'m"", 'usually', 'critical', 'facts', 'not', 'depicted', 'correctly', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Red', 'Baron', 'many', 'liberties', 'facts', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'proverbially', 'sighed', 'thought', 'was', 'opportunity', 'wasted', 'However', 'became', 'increasingly', 'engrossed', 'film', 'progressed', 'suspect', 'many', 'will', 'disagree', 'especially', 'aviation', 'history', 'aficionados', 'have', 'say', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'film', 'spirit', 'WWI', 'combat', 'aviation', 'even', 'many', 'liberal', 'liberties', 'facts', 'accurately', 'how', 'early', 'WWI', 'pilots', 'valued', 'chivalry', 'saw', 'war', 'sport', 'not', 'bloody', 'combat', 'was', 'how', 'war', 'progressed', 'reality', 'war', 'became', 'increasingly', 'clear', 'pilots', 'Manfred', 'von', 'Richthofen', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'beginning', 'interested', 'nothing', 'else', 'shooting', 'down', 'prey', 'unclear', 'von', 'Richthofen', 'actually', 'harbored', 'same', 'doubts', 'movie', 'war', 'progressed', 'motif', 'accurately', 'grimness', 'war', 'aerial', 'combat', 'scenes', 'were', 'well-done', 'are', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'show', 'potential', 'CGI', 'hopefully', 'more', 'WWI', 'WWII', 'aviation', 'movies', 'will', 'build', 'promise', 'was', 'completely', 'captivated', 'aviation', 'combat', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'opener', 'Richthofen', 'comrades', 'attend', 'funeral', 'British', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'aircraft', 'drop', 'wreath', 'somewhat', 'incredibly', 'pilot', 'grave', ""'m"", 'particularly', 'impressed', 'accuracy', 'Albatros', 'Fokker', 'Triplane', 'fighter', 'recreations', 'movie', 'spliced', 'many', 'historical', 'figures', 'fictional', 'relationships', 'great', 'fighter', 'ace', 'Werner', 'Voss', 'was', 'friendly', 'rival', 'Richthofen', 'never', 'close', 'comrade', 'depicted', 'film', 'Lanoe', 'Hawker', 'never', 'flew', 'Royal', 'Aircraft', 'SE-5', 'appeared', 'well', 'death', 'was', 'impressed', 'almost', 'major', 'characters', 'were', 'correctly', 'named', 'historical', 'prototypes.Yes', 'movie', 'facts', 'around', 'greatly', 'fictionalized', 'scenes', 'Roy', 'Brown', 'RFC', 'pilot', 'who', 'was', 'initially', 'credited', 'shooting', 'down', 'von', 'Richthofen', 'facts', 'showed', 'ace', 'was', 'downed', 'ground', 'fire', 'will', 'make', 'many', 'historians', 'gag', 'can', 'immediately', 'count', 'least', '10', 'film', 'morphs', 'fiction', 'also', 'have', 'comment', 'one', 'other', 'aspect', 'movie', 'thought', 'producers', 'admirably', 'included', 'Jewish', 'German', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'one', 'Richthofen', 'close', 'comrades', 'movie', 'noted', 'end', 'pilot', 'never', 'existed', 'was', 'instead', 'composite', 'real', 'Jewish', 'German', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'who', 'flew', 'WWI', 'producers', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'here', 'though', 'completely', 'neglecting', 'depict', 'Werner', 'Voss', 'Jewish', 'ancestry', 'could', 'have', 'depicted', 'Voss', 'Jewish', 'heritage', 'instead', 'creating', 'fictional', 'pilot', 'However', 'one', 'movie', 'novelized', 'bio-pic', 'Manfred', 'von', 'Richtehofen', 'engaging', 'enjoyable', 'dramatization', 'marred', 'only', 'clumsy', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'Richthofen', 'Kate', 'nurse', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'only', 'helped', 'care', 'ace', 'head', 'wound', 'remained', 'friend', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'romance', 'least', 'one', 'German', 'WWII', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'wrote', 'novelized', 'version', 'autobiography', 'Gunther', 'Bloemertz', 'Heaven', 'Next', 'Stop', 'Bloemertz', 'was', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'JG', '26', 'was', 'well-received', 'Germany', 'worldwide', 'eventually', 'translated', 'several', 'languages', 'incurring', 'several', 'orders', 'think', 'Red', 'Baron', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'similarly', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'period', 'WWI', 'aviation', 'film', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'spirit', 'facts', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'aviation', 'alone', 'Admittedly', 'who', 'demand', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'will', 'proverbially', 'gag', 'view', 'movie']",N/A

Bernabo,"[3, 5]","After the disappointment of ""Flyboys,"" it would be nice to see if the 21st century could produce a decent movie about the dog fighting pilots in the War to End All Wars, but 2008's  ""Der rote Baron"" (""The Red Baron"") is not it.  Ostensibly, this is the story of the German ace,Baron Manfred von Richthofen(Matthias Schweigh&ouml;fer), who had 80 confirmed kills, making him the greatest flying ace in that or any other war.  But writer-director Nikolai Mullerschon wants to tell the story of a true knight of the air, making the Richthofen not only German nobility but a German nobleman, who insists the goal is to shoot down planes rather than kill pilots.  This ideal of aerial combat should stand in stark contrast to the horrific trench warfare happening on the ground, where troops had to contend with such innovations as poison gas, machine guns, tanks, and aerial bombardments, but Mullerschon is more interested in painting his main character as not just a gentleman hero, but a clearly German one.  In 1918, Richthofen died in April and the war ended in November, and in this film the character actually tells his superiors that they should end the war because, from his purely practical perspective, they are not going to win the war.  Clearly, this is a Manfred von Richthofen who has contemporary post-Vietnam sensibilities.Consequently, not only does this film turn the title character into a different type of hero, it fails to pull off the effort.  In the same spirit of revisionism the film offers up the fictional character of Friedrich Sternberg (Maxim Mehmet), who represents the handful of Jewish aviators who fought for Germany.  Instead of constituting ominous foreshadowing of what is to happen with the Third Reich in the next generation, this is just another element suggesting these characters represent good Germans.  The Red Baron's chivalrous notions are rejected by his younger brother, Lothar (Volker Bruch), who is only too happy to fight without the pretenses of elegance.  But that fraternal conflict, and the larger debate about the nature of warfare it represents, are never fleshed out in any meaningful way.  I looked up Schweigh&ouml;fer's age, because I thought he looked a tad too young to play Richthofen, but it turns out he is the ballpark.  Still, he and the rest of the German aces are so young and handsome that they look like a Barvarian brat pack and I was worried that if they stood out in the sun their skin would start sparkling.The final and grossest outrage offered is the idea that Richthofen and Captain Roy Brown (Ralph Fiennes), the Canadian flier credited at the time with shooting down the Red Baron, are friendly enemies.  History is rewritten so that Richthofen shot down Brown and then saved his life, setting up Brown's rather ungentlemanly failure to return both parts of the favor.  But then this movie decides to just skip the episode of Richthofen's death and the controversy over who actually fired the fatal bullet that killed him (I think the evidence clearly supports that bullet was fired by someone on the ground and not by Brown from his airplane).  This would be like skipping the last leg of Amelia Earhart's fatal attempt to fly around the world in ""Amelia.""  For that matter, not only does the movie skip a key part of the end of Richthofen's life, it also omits his early time in the war, where he started off as a cavalry officer before switching the air corps and learning how to be a fighter pilot from Major Oswald Boelke.  There is also a relationship between Richthofen and K&auml;te Otersdorf (Lena Headey), the nurse who takes care of him after he is wounded, but this turns out not to be romantic but more an opportunity for our hero to wax rhetorical on the way he sees fighting.  Neither the script nor the acting transforms Richthofen into a memorable heroic figure.  Take away the impressive tally of 80 confirmed kills and there is simply not much here to make an impression.When it comes to movies about the First World War, it seems that the greatest ones are going to end up being the black and white classics made in the decades after the war, with ""Wings"" (the film that won the first Oscar for Best Picture), ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" and, my favorite, ""Sergeant York.""  After World War II you have ""Paths of Glory,"" ""Grand Illusion,"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" but at that point there is clearly an allegorical nature to those war stories, in which the setting might be World War I but the rhetorical import of the tales is more contemporary.  Besides, a ""true"" World War I movie has to have either trench warfare or biplanes, none of which really apply to those later films.  Even with ""Gallipoli,"" where you have the trenches, but the message of that classic Australian films is that the English were always looking to stick it to those members of the Empire from Down Under, which ultimately puts it more in the same category as ""Breaker Morant,"" than other tales of the Great War.  As for ""Der rote Baron,"" it might be marginally better than Roger Corman's more historically accurate 1971 film ""Von Richthofen & Brown,"" but I will still take ""The Blue Max"" over both films (and the same goes for Carl Schell's brief but memorable performance as the Red Baron in that 1966 film) when it comes to movies about dog fighting German aces.",3,A disappointing film about the WWI

1334068,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0039USJBA,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This film is basically a failure with some honest CGIs. Below I will try to describe the reasons why I judge this film so harshly, including some limited SPOILERS.The greatest weakness of this film is the political correctness which pushed the director and the scenarist towards the complete historical inaccuracy - as the result, the ""Red Baron"" on the screen has virtually NOTHING in common with the one that really existed, except for the name, the number of victories and the date of death.In the film Richthofen is almost a non-violent pacifist who cares greatly about not killing enemy pilots and observers and reminds it frequently to his men. In reality, exactly the OPPOSITE was true. Richthofen knew well, that men were the most vulnerable (and also the most precious) element of enemy airplanes, as even a single well aimed bullet hitting the pilot could finish a fight, when the destruction of engine or the wings took much more effort and munitions. He also always warned that when fighting the two placed planes, it was essential to kill the observer, who manned a defensive all azimut firing machine-gun, first, before going after the pilot.In the film Richthofen has doubts about the sense of continuing the war and he even shows insolence towards the Kaizer and general Hindenburg, advising the latter to finish the war as soon as possible. Those things never happened! The ""Red Baron"" was a Prussian aristocrat, son of a professional soldier and himself a career soldier, who started attending a military school at the age of eleven! When the war began he was already an officer in cavalry since 1911 and before joining the aviation he already fought as cavalryman in Belgium, in France and in Russia. He never expressed doubts about the issue of war. When in 1918 the high command, concerned about the possible consequences of his death on the morale on the nation, asked him to accept a post in headquarters, he refused and insisted to fight in the first line, even though his health was diminished after grievous wounds he suffered in 1917. A patriot, a monarchist, a natural born fighter and a Prussian and German nationalist, von Richthofen was never this kind of gentle ""peacenik"" we can see in the film!Less serious but quite annoying is the idiotic sweater von Richthofen wears all the time. It almost seems to me, that the director tried to ""demilitarize"" his character as much as possible and therefore made him wear an outfit which makes him look like a hippie from 70s rather than like a military pilot. I checked a lot of pictures of von Richthofen on the internet and I couldn't find even one in which he would wear such a thing - he either wears an uniform or, when relaxing with his fellow pilots, an open leather flying vest.The film doesn't even mentions the famous silver cups von Richthofen had made on special command for each of his victories - well, I guess that would made him less politically correct... In fact, probably the only moment when the REAL von Richthofen is shown at the screen is the moment when he orders the mechanicians to paint his plane all in red, and when reminded that it will prevent all surprise, he answers: ""I do not want them to be surprised, I want them to be afraid!"". Other than those few seconds, for the rest of the film the REAL von Richthofen is carefully hidden behind a sweater wearing, peace-loving, non-violent anti-war protester from 70s, who somehow by some strange accident happens to be the greatest fighter ace of World War I...Other historical inaccuracies are by comparison rather harmless. The completely fictious scene in which von Richthofen meets in person Captain Roy Brown, who in real life would later down and kill the ""Red Baron"", is of course absolutely fictional, but it is a good scene and it didn't offend me half as much as the alteration of von Richthofen's character. There are also some inaccuracies concerning the technical things (types of planes, paintings, etc.), but you need to be a real expert in World War I aviation to notice them.The romance with the nurse played by Lena Headey has some charming moments, but mostly it is completely useless. Once again political correctness pushed the director into making a scene in which the nurse shows von Richthofen a hospital full of badly wounded soldiers, seemingly to show him how horrible is war - well, as it was already said earlier, he certainly had a pretty good idea about it, after fighting as cavalry officer in Belgium, France and Russia in 1914-15... Also, let's remember here, that von Richthofen was 25 when he died and the nurse, Kate Otersdorf, with whom he was in love, was most probably of his age or younger - in this context, choosing for this role Lena Headey, who was already 35, gives to this film a kind of ""cougar factor"", which it really didn't need...The were only few things I liked in this film. The CGIs were maybe not great, but they were honest. Director made a good choice by selecting Matthias Schweighofer to play the main character - but sadly completely butchered the character itself... Finally, the rather elegant solution of taking care of von Richthofen's last fight and death - considering how controversial is this event, I think the director did the right thing by not choosing any of the sides in the controversy...But bottom line, this is a very BAD film, which deliberately FALSIFIES history in the name of political correctness.

1334069,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0039USJBA,MadMacs,"[2, 2]","One of the absolutely funniest things I've read recently: The specialist reviewers who are livid about the historical accuracy of this film and more specifically Director Nikolai Mullerschon's choice to not depict the death of Richthofen.Why did he do it? Because it's the very entrenched melodramatic mentality of these varied experts that the filmmakers were trying to avoid. If you show his death one way - the other dozen experts are suddenly up in arms, screaming their ""facts"", sputtering their perspectives, and of course, entirely missing the point. The Red Baron was dead.Productions like this will always attract the very worst specialized kooks in life.A mountaineering movie will be filled with angry mountaineers ""explaining"" to the masses how wrong the filmmakers were, what was wrong with the equipment, how wrong the techniques that were shown. A car racing movie... a skydiving movie... a sailing movie... a.... have you noticed that most of the A-type personalities and their specialized endeavors harbor the most venomous reviews?Ironically, if you talk with these guys in real life, when discussing other rarified endeavors and their representation in the media, they couldn't give a crap. In their tunnel-visioned view = only their world is decreed pure, untouchable and unfilmable. (laughing)There will never be a satisfactory movie for these self-absorbed knuckleheads - never.So now my review.A fascinating portrait of the world famous ""Red Baron"" - Manfred von Richthofen.If what I've read about Von Richthofen is accurate - it is apparently verboten to depict the Baron as something other than a stout nationalist determined to win the war for the fatherland.But then you have to remember, even the historically ""accurate"" biographical information is extraordinarily speculative. Beyond the specific dates and places - we can't know for certain what he thought or how he felt. Not with a degree of absolute certainty, especially since he died so young. Who can honestly say what you were thinking and feeling when you're 25 - is how you think and feel when you're 45, or even 65. With age comes perspective, and it's something we will never have since Richthofen was killed at an age when most of us were just beginning to mature into mental adulthood.Honestly, think about it, he was twenty-five years old when he died.So I appreciate the film for what it is, not what it was 'supposed' to be. From a pure film perspective I found it to be a touching portrait of the man who would become the greatest combat flyer of World War I. Certainly, the filmmakers were taking some fairly broad artistic liberties with the character. Would a dedicated officer, born to the aristocracy, question the imperial throne and his personage? Ludicrous. But it gave the film the required juxtaposition of light and dark - we have our hero, now we need the enemy. And certainly not the enemy of the flags, rather the embodiment of the other: The Warmonger.Additionally, the aerial combat scenes were superior to most, including the heavily CGI-driven 'Flyboys'. I honestly felt like I was sitting in these first generation aircraft - impressive and breathtaking aerial dogfighting. The last time I felt like I was ""in the cockpit"" was 1975's ""The Great Waldo Pepper"".Again, this is not what I would consider a historically accurate film. It's fairly obvious that Mullerschon had romanticized his countryman - but can you judge a John Wayne combat movie with a critical eye toward realism? Or do you, as a cinephile, appreciate the story which is being told?Me? I love the story.",4,"Enjoyable, If Historically Challenged Portrait",1303257600,"04 20, 2011",2011,3586,"['One', 'absolutely', 'funniest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'read', 'recently', 'specialist', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'livid', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'more', 'specifically', 'Director', 'Nikolai', 'Mullerschon', 'choice', 'not', 'depict', 'death', 'Richthofen.Why', 'did', 'do', 'very', 'entrenched', 'melodramatic', 'mentality', 'varied', 'experts', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'avoid', 'show', 'death', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'dozen', 'experts', 'are', 'suddenly', 'up', 'arms', 'screaming', 'facts', 'sputtering', 'perspectives', 'course', 'entirely', 'missing', 'point', 'Red', 'Baron', 'was', 'dead.Productions', 'will', 'always', 'attract', 'very', 'worst', 'specialized', 'kooks', 'life.A', 'mountaineering', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'filled', 'angry', 'mountaineers', 'explaining', 'masses', 'how', 'wrong', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'equipment', 'how', 'wrong', 'techniques', 'were', 'shown', 'car', 'racing', 'movie', 'skydiving', 'movie', 'sailing', 'movie', 'have', 'noticed', 'most', 'A-type', 'personalities', 'specialized', 'endeavors', 'harbor', 'most', 'venomous', 'reviews', 'Ironically', 'talk', 'guys', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'discussing', 'other', 'rarified', 'endeavors', 'representation', 'media', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'crap', 'tunnel-visioned', 'view', 'only', 'world', 'decreed', 'pure', 'untouchable', 'unfilmable', 'laughing', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'satisfactory', 'movie', 'self-absorbed', 'knuckleheads', 'never.So', 'now', 'review.A', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'world', 'famous', 'Red', 'Baron', 'Manfred', 'von', 'Richthofen.If', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Von', 'Richthofen', 'accurate', 'apparently', 'verboten', 'depict', 'Baron', 'something', 'other', 'stout', 'nationalist', 'determined', 'win', 'war', 'fatherland.But', 'then', 'have', 'remember', 'even', 'historically', 'accurate', 'biographical', 'information', 'extraordinarily', 'speculative', 'specific', 'dates', 'places', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'certain', 'what', 'thought', 'how', 'felt', 'Not', 'degree', 'absolute', 'certainty', 'especially', 'died', 'so', 'young', 'Who', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'when', ""'re"", '25', 'how', 'think', 'feel', 'when', ""'re"", '45', 'even', '65', 'age', 'perspective', 'something', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'Richthofen', 'was', 'killed', 'age', 'when', 'most', 'were', 'just', 'beginning', 'mature', 'mental', 'adulthood.Honestly', 'think', 'was', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'died.So', 'appreciate', 'film', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'was', ""'supposed"", 'be', 'pure', 'film', 'perspective', 'found', 'be', 'touching', 'portrait', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'greatest', 'combat', 'flyer', 'World', 'War', 'Certainly', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'taking', 'fairly', 'broad', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'character', 'Would', 'dedicated', 'officer', 'born', 'aristocracy', 'question', 'imperial', 'throne', 'personage', 'Ludicrous', 'gave', 'film', 'required', 'juxtaposition', 'light', 'dark', 'have', 'hero', 'now', 'need', 'enemy', 'certainly', 'not', 'enemy', 'flags', 'rather', 'embodiment', 'other', 'Warmonger.Additionally', 'aerial', 'combat', 'scenes', 'were', 'superior', 'most', 'including', 'heavily', 'CGI-driven', ""'Flyboys"", 'honestly', 'felt', 'was', 'sitting', 'first', 'generation', 'aircraft', 'impressive', 'breathtaking', 'aerial', 'dogfighting', 'last', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'cockpit', 'was', '1975', 'Great', 'Waldo', 'Pepper', '.Again', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'historically', 'accurate', 'film', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'Mullerschon', 'had', 'romanticized', 'countryman', 'can', 'judge', 'John', 'Wayne', 'combat', 'movie', 'critical', 'eye', 'realism', 'do', 'cinephile', 'appreciate', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'Me', 'love', 'story']",N/A
1334070,AWA79DF9KLF5Y,B0039USJBA,"Merlin Douglas Larsen ""Merlin the Mad""","[2, 2]","This film is not a low budget production. The acting is quite good. The casting even better: Manfred von Richthofen is visually almost cloned in Matthias Schweigh&ouml;fer, especially when he imitates the iconic facial expressions that we see in Richthofen's photographs. The CGI is first rate, resulting in very convincing, atmospheric scenes. This is not actually a war film, that is to say, it is not an action film; so the amount of on-screen flying and dogfighting is minimal. The technical details are almost entirely correct. I did see where many aircraft types were in operation long before their historical entry date (and Lanoe Hawker flew a DeHavilland DH2, not an SE5). Compared to the travesty that was CGI ""flight"" in ""Fly Boys"", the flight and combat scenes in ""The Red Baron"" are epics of realism. I was satisfied visually with the little bit of war ""footage"" that this film gave me. Also, despite most of the critical, even objectionable commentary that I have read in the years since this movie first came out, I did not find the script particularly poor, as movie scripts go. There were no glaring embarrassments where my belief in the story, as it was being presented, was utterly suspended or offended.Those are the positive aspects of the film. Now to the far weightier negative side:This is meant to be an anti-war picture, using ""the Red Baron"" as the catalyst. Or, I should rather say, exploiting Manfred von Richthofen long after his death to make an anti-war statement - again and yet again, as if we haven't already got enough deliberately, politically correct anti-war films. But as an anti-war statement it largely fails. This is mainly because of the undue focus on the romantic relationship with Kate, the nurse who ministered to von Richthofen while he convalesced following a serious bullet wound to the head (unhistorically, inflicted by Roy Brown - Manfred was actually wounded by the gunner of an FE2 observation plane). Kate is a major character in this movie; no matter where Jasta 11 goes, there too goes the nurse. In their last scene together she even emerges from the baron's tent, having obviously spent the night. The romantic attachment is okay; it might even be mildly historical, since she and Richthofen would have seen a great deal of each other for weeks. But to have Kate also nurse Roy Brown earlier; then to have the two of them meet in ""No Man's Land"" and discuss her over sips of brandy from Brown's flask, is pushing the romantic ""triangle"" into strained emphasis. All we see in the end is this doomed, embryonic romance which dominates the plot and saps any anti-war message going on.There is ""lip service"" paid several times throughout the picture to the horrors of war and the hypocrisy of the German propaganda machine that the media had become. But we never see more than a few severely wounded men in a hospital ward. There is no feeling of countless hundreds of thousands of troops doomed to push each other back and forth through curtains of lead and high explosive. All we see are a few dozen soldiers at a time. (Even Young Indiana Jones on TV got the panoramic scope of a massed advance across ""No Man's Land"" right.) ""The Red Baron"" shows virtually none of the horrors of war that it is out to decry. So as a film it fails in its purpose and leaves the viewer with a pallid, unconvincing love story instead; and not even a tragic one at that, since virtually everyone viewing the movie already knows that von Richtohofen was killed in combat.The ""making of"" track hammers home the unhistorical relationship of Richthofen and Brown that the movie portrays, as if everything we've just seen actually happened, and in fact NONE of it happened. I found the ""making of"" track largely a waste of time. And the actors' interviews were shallow and groping (perhaps the actors are, I don't know).So, in summation: I give three stars for the visuals and photography - it is a pretty picture; 2.5 stars for the casting and acting over all; if the historical accuracy (especially of Richthofen's personality) had been there I would give at least two stars for the script, but since the script's only virtue is that it is a film first and history last - and as such it is terrible factually - it gets only one star for script. And this crime of bogus ""facts"" masquerading as history is pounded home further in the ""making of"" documentary, making me want to kick some writers', directors' and producers' backsides around the block.",2,Not bad as a movie but terrible history,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,4486,"['film', 'not', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'casting', 'even', 'better', 'Manfred', 'von', 'Richthofen', 'visually', 'almost', 'cloned', 'Matthias', 'Schweigh', 'ouml', 'fer', 'especially', 'when', 'iconic', 'facial', 'expressions', 'see', 'Richthofen', 'photographs', 'CGI', 'first', 'rate', 'resulting', 'very', 'convincing', 'atmospheric', 'scenes', 'not', 'actually', 'war', 'film', 'say', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'amount', 'on-screen', 'flying', 'dogfighting', 'minimal', 'technical', 'details', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'correct', 'did', 'see', 'where', 'many', 'aircraft', 'types', 'were', 'operation', 'long', 'historical', 'entry', 'date', 'Lanoe', 'Hawker', 'flew', 'DeHavilland', 'DH2', 'not', 'SE5', 'Compared', 'travesty', 'was', 'CGI', 'flight', 'Fly', 'Boys', 'flight', 'combat', 'scenes', 'Red', 'Baron', 'are', 'epics', 'realism', 'was', 'satisfied', 'visually', 'little', 'bit', 'war', 'footage', 'film', 'gave', 'Also', 'most', 'critical', 'even', 'objectionable', 'commentary', 'have', 'read', 'years', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'script', 'particularly', 'poor', 'movie', 'scripts', 'go', 'were', 'glaring', 'where', 'belief', 'story', 'was', 'being', 'presented', 'was', 'utterly', 'suspended', 'are', 'positive', 'aspects', 'film', 'Now', 'far', 'weightier', 'negative', 'side', 'meant', 'be', 'anti-war', 'picture', 'using', 'Red', 'Baron', 'catalyst', 'should', 'rather', 'say', 'exploiting', 'Manfred', 'von', 'Richthofen', 'long', 'death', 'make', 'anti-war', 'statement', 'again', 'yet', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'got', 'enough', 'deliberately', 'politically', 'correct', 'anti-war', 'films', 'anti-war', 'statement', 'largely', 'mainly', 'undue', 'focus', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Kate', 'nurse', 'who', 'ministered', 'von', 'Richthofen', 'convalesced', 'following', 'serious', 'bullet', 'wound', 'head', 'unhistorically', 'inflicted', 'Roy', 'Brown', 'Manfred', 'was', 'actually', 'wounded', 'gunner', 'FE2', 'observation', 'plane', 'Kate', 'major', 'character', 'movie', 'matter', 'where', 'Jasta', '11', 'too', 'nurse', 'last', 'scene', 'together', 'even', 'baron', 'tent', 'having', 'obviously', 'spent', 'night', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'okay', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'mildly', 'historical', 'Richthofen', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'great', 'deal', 'other', 'weeks', 'have', 'Kate', 'also', 'Roy', 'Brown', 'earlier', 'then', 'have', 'two', 'meet', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'discuss', 'sips', 'brandy', 'Brown', 'flask', 'pushing', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'strained', 'emphasis', 'see', 'end', 'doomed', 'embryonic', 'romance', 'plot', 'saps', 'anti-war', 'message', 'going', 'on.There', 'lip', 'service', 'paid', 'several', 'times', 'picture', 'horrors', 'war', 'hypocrisy', 'German', 'propaganda', 'machine', 'media', 'had', 'become', 'never', 'see', 'more', 'few', 'severely', 'wounded', 'men', 'hospital', 'ward', 'feeling', 'countless', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'troops', 'doomed', 'push', 'other', 'back', 'forth', 'curtains', 'lead', 'high', 'explosive', 'see', 'are', 'few', 'dozen', 'soldiers', 'time', 'Even', 'Young', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'TV', 'got', 'panoramic', 'scope', 'massed', 'advance', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'right', 'Red', 'Baron', 'virtually', 'none', 'horrors', 'war', 'out', 'decry', 'So', 'film', 'purpose', 'viewer', 'pallid', 'unconvincing', 'love', 'story', 'instead', 'not', 'even', 'tragic', 'one', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'viewing', 'movie', 'already', 'von', 'Richtohofen', 'was', 'killed', 'combat.The', 'making', 'track', 'hammers', 'home', 'unhistorical', 'relationship', 'Richthofen', 'Brown', 'movie', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'actually', 'happened', 'fact', 'NONE', 'happened', 'found', 'making', 'track', 'largely', 'waste', 'time', 'actors', 'interviews', 'were', 'shallow', 'groping', 'perhaps', 'actors', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '.So', 'summation', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'visuals', 'photography', 'pretty', 'picture', '2.5', 'stars', 'casting', 'acting', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'especially', 'Richthofen', 'personality', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'would', 'give', 'least', 'two', 'stars', 'script', 'script', 'only', 'virtue', 'film', 'first', 'history', 'last', 'such', 'terrible', 'factually', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'script', 'crime', 'bogus', 'facts', 'masquerading', 'history', 'pounded', 'home', 'further', 'making', 'documentary', 'making', 'want', 'kick', 'writers', 'directors', 'producers', 'backsides', 'block']",N/A

They're great; I love that kind of stuff.The message of the film is anti-war.  It doesn't glorify the battles, but rather offers a perpsective.  One sees the hopelessness of the men in the trenches- getting cut down in an instant (and for what?); the nurses dealing with endless casualities; the fragile planes ripping apart.  The pilots try to keep a sense of mutual honor and respect, but as Captain Brown plainly says, ""We're just here to kill each other.""Yes, they tend to exaggerate the Baron's pacifism, the romance with the nurse is a speculation, the meeting with Brown, fiction;  they don't highlight in any detail the Baron's comrades, like the daring Voss, and there is no final battle seen on screen. We see the pilots faces going into battle, knowing they are pretty much doomed and then, cut away to a graveyard.Overall, regardless to the naysayers, I enjoyed this film.  The romance is touching, the characters, whether true or not, interesting, and the feel of the movie didn't leave me depressed, very well done, and they include a making of feature in the extras.",4,Entertaining Romantic Fiction,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,1975,"['well', 'made', 'acted', 'historic', 'fiction', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'history', 'offers', 'nifty', 'CGI', 'captivating', 'romance.Directed', 'acted', 'very', 'good', 'German', 'English', 'actors', 'crew', 'story', 'Red', 'Baron', 'tale', 'aristocratic', 'naive', 'spoiled', 'sportsman', 'who', 'more', 'competition', 'rather', 'killing', 'effort', 'eyes', 'are', 'opened', 'attractive', 'French', 'nurse', 'played', 'intensely', 'competent', 'Nina', 'Headey', 'who', 'so', 'called', 'glory', 'honor', 'war', 'interaction', 'enemy', 'ace', 'amiable', 'practical', 'Captain', 'Brown.The', 'Baron', 'soon', 'war', 'be', 'brutal', 'horrific', 'slaughter', 'star', 'power', 'nothing', 'more', 'pawn', 'Kaiser', 'propaganda.The', 'dogfights', 'background', 'settings', 'are', 'super', 'e.g.', 'showing', 'opulent', 'Berlin', 'desolate', 'man', 'land', 'giving', 'lots', 'biplanes', 'triplanes', 'dirigibles', ""'re"", 'great', 'love', 'kind', 'stuff.The', 'message', 'film', 'anti-war', ""n't"", 'glorify', 'battles', 'rather', 'perpsective', 'One', 'hopelessness', 'men', 'trenches-', 'getting', 'cut', 'down', 'instant', 'what', 'nurses', 'dealing', 'endless', 'casualities', 'fragile', 'planes', 'ripping', 'apart', 'pilots', 'try', 'keep', 'sense', 'mutual', 'honor', 'respect', 'Captain', 'Brown', 'plainly', ""'re"", 'just', 'here', 'kill', 'other', 'Yes', 'tend', 'exaggerate', 'Baron', 'pacifism', 'romance', 'nurse', 'speculation', 'meeting', 'Brown', 'fiction', 'do', ""n't"", 'highlight', 'detail', 'Baron', 'comrades', 'daring', 'Voss', 'final', 'battle', 'seen', 'screen', 'see', 'pilots', 'going', 'battle', 'knowing', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'doomed', 'then', 'cut', 'away', 'graveyard.Overall', 'regardless', 'naysayers', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'romance', 'touching', 'characters', 'true', 'not', 'interesting', 'feel', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'depressed', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'include', 'making', 'feature', 'extras']",N/A
1334075,A2K6VDHSE2NU4R,B0039USJBA,Nachtjager,"[102, 113]","Allow me to say, I've anxiously awaited the release of this DVD in U.S. format as I'm an extreme military history enthusiast, especially in the fields of WWI and WWII aviation and armor.  I've watched clips of this movie and the trailers for it on youtube for well over a year and expected it to have the fluffy love story others have complained about, but, that is just one of the movie's many problems.  Once again, movie makers have proven they have NO IDEA who the audience is for HISTORICALLY THEMED MOVIES!  I'm starting to get really amazed at how consistently movie makers miss the mark - and waste magnificent opportunities to make a great movie in the process.First off, everything was here for them to make the end-all fantastic movie about the life of Manfred Von Richtofen.  They built 23 Albatros and Fokker airplanes for this film for pity's sake!  Then, all of the flying, apparently, is done using green screen and CG technology - there is no ""real"" flying in the movie.  Watch the extra features, they show how this was done - I was stunned.On the plus side, this movie is far better than ""Flyboys"" which was just horrible.  On the downside, I have no idea who this movie's about, because it darn sure isn't about Manfred Von Richthofen.  The only things they got right here are that he was German and he had a red airplane - other than that, they made everything else up from scratch.  His friendship with Werner Voss is touched upon, but only because they use Voss (shamefully) to push along the pointless and fictional love story between Richthofen and a nurse who seems to be everywhere.  The actual careers of the pilots themselves is entirely glossed over.  Voss's phenomenal last flight isn't shown and if you don't pay attention, you won't even realize when Richtofen finds out he's been killed.  Likewise, Von Richtofen's last flight isn't shown at all.  There's actually very little flying in this movie - almost all the flight scenes are up on youtube.If you're going to make a movie about Manfred Von Richtofen, it should've started when Oswald Boelke picked him out to join Jasta 2, and show him learning from the master to forge his skills.  This movie starts months after Boelke's death just before MvR is awarded his Blue Max - a downright pointless place to start I thought.  Believe it or not, in this movie, MvR and Captain Roy Brown ARE CLOSE FRIENDS!  WHAT?!!!  In fact, Manfred shoots Brown down in early 1917, Brown escapes from a POW camp, they meet again later after having both been shot down, share drinks and notes on the SAME nurse, then they just pal around!  WHAT A CROCK!  You really have to struggle to write history this badly.  Then, all the German troops in the trenches look like they just got back from the dry cleaners.The only reason I give this movie any props at all is because the actors did great with the terrible script they were given - the acting is quite good.  The aerial scenes are spectacular and look quite real, even though there aren't enough of them.  And, they got the uniform details right, even though they went a little too floppy on the caps.Perhaps someday, someone will do a GOOD movie on this legendary figure and do so without having to insert 80% fictional fluff and filler.  Richtofen, Voss, and Roy Brown deserved a much better telling of their story than this.",3,VERY DISAPPOINTING MOVIE - pure fiction filled with problems.,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,3347,"['Allow', 'say', ""'ve"", 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'release', 'DVD', 'U.S.', 'format', ""'m"", 'extreme', 'military', 'history', 'enthusiast', 'especially', 'fields', 'WWI', 'WWII', 'aviation', 'armor', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'clips', 'movie', 'trailers', 'youtube', 'well', 'year', 'expected', 'have', 'fluffy', 'love', 'story', 'others', 'have', 'complained', 'just', 'one', 'movie', 'many', 'problems', 'Once', 'again', 'movie', 'makers', 'have', 'proven', 'have', 'NO', 'IDEA', 'who', 'audience', 'HISTORICALLY', 'THEMED', 'MOVIES', ""'m"", 'starting', 'get', 'really', 'amazed', 'how', 'consistently', 'movie', 'makers', 'miss', 'mark', 'waste', 'magnificent', 'opportunities', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'process.First', 'off', 'everything', 'was', 'here', 'make', 'end-all', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'life', 'Manfred', 'Von', 'Richtofen', 'built', '23', 'Albatros', 'Fokker', 'airplanes', 'film', 'pity', 'sake', 'Then', 'flying', 'apparently', 'done', 'using', 'green', 'screen', 'CG', 'technology', 'real', 'flying', 'movie', 'Watch', 'extra', 'features', 'show', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'stunned.On', 'plus', 'side', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'Flyboys', 'was', 'just', 'horrible', 'downside', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'movie', 'darn', 'sure', ""n't"", 'about', 'Manfred', 'Von', 'Richthofen', 'only', 'things', 'got', 'right', 'here', 'are', 'was', 'German', 'had', 'red', 'airplane', 'other', 'made', 'everything', 'else', 'scratch', 'friendship', 'Werner', 'Voss', 'touched', 'only', 'use', 'Voss', 'shamefully', 'push', 'along', 'pointless', 'fictional', 'love', 'story', 'Richthofen', 'nurse', 'who', 'be', 'everywhere', 'actual', 'careers', 'pilots', 'entirely', 'glossed', 'over', 'Voss', 'phenomenal', 'last', 'flight', ""n't"", 'shown', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'when', 'Richtofen', 'out', 'been', 'killed', 'Likewise', 'Von', 'Richtofen', 'last', 'flight', ""n't"", 'shown', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'flying', 'movie', 'almost', 'flight', 'scenes', 'are', 'up', 'youtube.If', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'Manfred', 'Von', 'Richtofen', 'should', ""'ve"", 'started', 'when', 'Oswald', 'Boelke', 'picked', 'out', 'join', 'Jasta', '2', 'show', 'learning', 'master', 'forge', 'skills', 'movie', 'months', 'Boelke', 'death', 'just', 'MvR', 'awarded', 'Blue', 'Max', 'downright', 'pointless', 'place', 'start', 'thought', 'Believe', 'not', 'movie', 'MvR', 'Captain', 'Roy', 'Brown', 'ARE', 'CLOSE', 'FRIENDS', 'WHAT', 'fact', 'Manfred', 'shoots', 'Brown', 'down', 'early', '1917', 'Brown', 'POW', 'camp', 'meet', 'again', 'later', 'having', 'been', 'shot', 'down', 'share', 'drinks', 'notes', 'SAME', 'nurse', 'then', 'just', 'pal', 'around', 'WHAT', 'CROCK', 'really', 'have', 'struggle', 'write', 'history', 'badly', 'Then', 'German', 'troops', 'trenches', 'look', 'just', 'got', 'back', 'dry', 'cleaners.The', 'only', 'reason', 'give', 'movie', 'props', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'terrible', 'script', 'were', 'given', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'aerial', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'look', 'quite', 'real', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'got', 'uniform', 'details', 'right', 'even', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'floppy', 'caps.Perhaps', 'someday', 'someone', 'will', 'do', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'legendary', 'figure', 'do', 'so', 'having', 'insert', '80', '%', 'fictional', 'fluff', 'filler', 'Richtofen', 'Voss', 'Roy', 'Brown', 'deserved', 'much', 'better', 'telling', 'story']",N/A

But where John Guillermin's film had a genuinely ruthless anti-hero and stunning aerial sequences shot in real planes, this quickly chips away at its hero's early arrogance to find the New Man underneath and too often limits the dogfights to brief green screen and CGI sequences that are good enough but not particularly convincing (though at least are slightly better photographed than the soft and undetailed scenes on terra firma). But while it spends far too much time on the ground and never offers a single prolonged or outstanding aerial setpiece to energise the film, it's not without redeeming features, offering Von Richthofen as the first superstar air ace, star of a thousand battlefront postcards who even has French prisoners stopping him to ask for autographs he gladly signs. There is even some attempt to look at the psychology behind his tactics and the propaganda machinations behind his rise to fame, Germany's need for a hero combining with his initial arrogance, thrill of the hunt and ideal of fighting a war with grace to create the perfect media-friendly heroic image in an increasingly ugly war, while it acknowledges the incestuous nature of the war in Europe, with relatives fighting on either side in family ties that mirror the old collapsed system of European alliances. Unfortunately it raises issues but only pays them lip service and all too often dumbs down with rushed scenes and on-the-nose dialogue that spells everything out far too specifically - it even adds captions like `Berlin, capital of the German Empire' for those who flunked their basic geography.Matthias Schweighofer is adequate in the early scenes where Von Richthofen's arrogance exceeds his actions, but develops little gravitas as the role progresses, underlining the bland predictability of the character's journey from exhilaration to disillusion as he becomes increasingly uncomfortable with his role as a propaganda tool. Til Schweiger and Lena Headey fare rather better in their clich&eacute;d roles, though Joseph Fiennes is unable to do anything with his painfully trite scenes as Roy Brown, the Canadian air ace credited with shooting down Von Richthofen (the film dodges that controversy by not showing the Baron's demise, giving him a romantic farewell before flying off into legend instead). Rather than offering any alternate perspective to the Red Baron's view of war, he's simply there to help facilitate the German ace's relationship with Headey's nurse, who opens his eyes to the true horrors of war and turns him into a politically correct jaded 21st Century figure who even answers back the Kaiser about the futility of mechanised murder in the hope of making him more acceptable to modern audiences. Unfortunately it tends to make him rather bland and anachronistic instead, something the sporadically inappropriate moments of clich&eacute;d world music in Stefan Hansen and Dirk Reichardt's score only amplifies. The end result is a watchable but unconvincingly romanticised potboiler that never does its subject or its setting justice and never offers the kind of thrilling scenes in the air that films made over half a century ago did.Monterey's US Bluray and DVD release of the film is heavily cut from 129-minutes to 106, but the uncut English-language version is available in a region-free Blu-ray edition in the UK from Showbox's with an acceptable 2.35:1 widescreen transfer considering the weaknesses of the original cinematography and a decent array of extras: making of and visual effects featurettes, 6 brief deleted scenes, outtakes, stills gallery, trailer and, er, music video of the end title song - yes, the film ends with a German pop song...",3,The Politically Correct Baron,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,4029,"['Shot', 'English', 'largely', 'German', 'cast', 'Nikolai', 'Mullerschon', '2008', 'German', 'would-be', 'epic', 'Red', 'Baron', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'better', 'slightly', 'more', 'ambitious', 'recent', 'Flyboys', 'still', 'beside', 'earlier', 'films', 'first', 'war', 'air', 'Aces', 'High', 'particular', 'Blue', 'Max', 'times', 'strives', 'emulate', 'where', 'John', 'Guillermin', 'film', 'had', 'genuinely', 'ruthless', 'anti-hero', 'stunning', 'aerial', 'sequences', 'shot', 'real', 'planes', 'quickly', 'chips', 'away', 'hero', 'early', 'arrogance', 'find', 'New', 'Man', 'underneath', 'too', 'often', 'dogfights', 'brief', 'green', 'screen', 'CGI', 'sequences', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'least', 'are', 'slightly', 'better', 'photographed', 'soft', 'undetailed', 'scenes', 'terra', 'firma', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'ground', 'never', 'single', 'prolonged', 'outstanding', 'aerial', 'setpiece', 'energise', 'film', 'not', 'redeeming', 'features', 'offering', 'Von', 'Richthofen', 'first', 'superstar', 'air', 'ace', 'star', 'thousand', 'battlefront', 'postcards', 'who', 'even', 'French', 'prisoners', 'stopping', 'ask', 'autographs', 'gladly', 'signs', 'even', 'attempt', 'look', 'psychology', 'tactics', 'propaganda', 'machinations', 'rise', 'fame', 'Germany', 'need', 'hero', 'combining', 'initial', 'arrogance', 'thrill', 'hunt', 'ideal', 'fighting', 'war', 'grace', 'create', 'perfect', 'media-friendly', 'heroic', 'image', 'increasingly', 'ugly', 'war', 'incestuous', 'nature', 'war', 'Europe', 'relatives', 'fighting', 'side', 'family', 'ties', 'mirror', 'old', 'collapsed', 'system', 'European', 'alliances', 'Unfortunately', 'issues', 'only', 'lip', 'service', 'too', 'often', 'down', 'rushed', 'scenes', 'on-the-nose', 'dialogue', 'everything', 'out', 'far', 'too', 'specifically', 'even', 'captions', 'Berlin', 'capital', 'German', 'Empire', 'who', 'flunked', 'basic', 'geography.Matthias', 'Schweighofer', 'adequate', 'early', 'scenes', 'where', 'Von', 'Richthofen', 'arrogance', 'actions', 'little', 'gravitas', 'role', 'underlining', 'bland', 'predictability', 'character', 'journey', 'exhilaration', 'disillusion', 'increasingly', 'uncomfortable', 'role', 'propaganda', 'tool', 'Til', 'Schweiger', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'fare', 'rather', 'better', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'roles', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'unable', 'do', 'anything', 'painfully', 'trite', 'scenes', 'Roy', 'Brown', 'Canadian', 'air', 'ace', 'credited', 'shooting', 'down', 'Von', 'Richthofen', 'film', 'controversy', 'not', 'showing', 'Baron', 'demise', 'giving', 'romantic', 'farewell', 'flying', 'off', 'legend', 'instead', 'Rather', 'offering', 'alternate', 'perspective', 'Red', 'Baron', 'view', 'war', 'simply', 'there', 'help', 'facilitate', 'German', 'ace', 'relationship', 'Headey', 'nurse', 'who', 'eyes', 'true', 'horrors', 'war', 'politically', 'correct', 'jaded', '21st', 'Century', 'figure', 'who', 'even', 'back', 'Kaiser', 'futility', 'mechanised', 'murder', 'hope', 'making', 'more', 'acceptable', 'modern', 'audiences', 'Unfortunately', 'make', 'rather', 'bland', 'anachronistic', 'instead', 'something', 'sporadically', 'inappropriate', 'moments', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'world', 'music', 'Stefan', 'Hansen', 'Dirk', 'Reichardt', 'score', 'only', 'end', 'result', 'watchable', 'unconvincingly', 'romanticised', 'potboiler', 'never', 'subject', 'setting', 'justice', 'never', 'kind', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'air', 'films', 'made', 'century', 'did.Monterey', 'US', 'Bluray', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'heavily', 'cut', '129-minutes', '106', 'uncut', 'English-language', 'version', 'available', 'region-free', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'UK', 'Showbox', 'acceptable', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'considering', 'weaknesses', 'original', 'cinematography', 'decent', 'array', 'extras', 'making', 'visual', 'effects', 'featurettes', '6', 'brief', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'stills', 'gallery', 'trailer', 'er', 'music', 'video', 'end', 'title', 'song', 'yes', 'film', 'German', 'pop', 'song']",N/A
1334087,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0039USJBA,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","A German production ""The Red Baron"" attempts to be two things at the same time, a biographical film (with a romantic focus) and a Michael Bay-like effect-ridden action film. This is a very ambitious project with a cast of mostly German players speaking English (probably international market in producers' mind). The story of the Red Baron, or Manfred von Richthofen (played by Matthias Schweigh&ouml;fer) - which was taken up in a Roger Corman film ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" back in 1971 - would be perfect for the basis of action-packed period piece, but to be that ""The Red Baron"" still needs one thing: a tight and engrossing script.The unfocused screenplay tries to cover so many things about this legendary person, such as his love story and conflict with his brother Lothar Von Richthofen (Volker Bruch), but everything looks clich&eacute;d. There is no dynamic interaction between him and other flying aces like Captain Roy Brown (Joseph Fiennes) and Werner Voss (Til Schweiger), which would have made the generic story more compelling. The film just moves on from one episode to another, without letting us know about the characters.The combat scenes (obviously using green screen effect) are decent, but its pace is a little hectic. The effects themselves are fine, but fail to show us what made the Red Baron Germany's most feared air ace. His romance with a pacifist nurse Kate Otersdorf (Lena Headey) lacks passion with their dialogue devoid of emotions.""The Red Baron"" is a generic and by-the-numbers bio-pic.

1334089,A3373I4II32NA1,B0039USJBA,Tyler,"[2, 4]","I first watched this movie on Redbox and loved it! Weeks later, I watched it on Netflix and loved it! Then I decided to buy it, watched it when it came in the mail yesterday, and still loved it!The story goes into who Baron Manfred von Richthofen really was--a man of mystery which some called him. I first heard about the Red Baron as a kid reading ""Peanuts"" comic strips and wondering what that dog Snoopy was imitating while sitting on his doghouse and in an outdated flying outfit. Then I heard the mentions of a great German ace, one of the best in WW1 with over 80 kills before his own plane went down in flames in the spring of 1918. When I first watched it, I found out what kind of man that the Baron really was, a respectful one.Apparently, he made little notice of his reputation until 1916, which is where the movie begins. The first scene is of the Baron and his German flying squadron soaring over the mourners at the funeral of a fallen British pilot-officer, and as the stunned Allied troops look on with surprise, the Baron drops a bunch of flowers directly into the freshly-dug grave from overhead, getting chewed out for it by a German superior later on. As the number of kills increase to his name, you see him confirm his kills by ripping off the flying insignia from each destroyed Allied plane, and finally get promoted to commanding his own squadron, which his younger brother even joins. But what really makes a name for himself is when he downs a British major, a flying ace that no one thought he had a chance at defeating.von Richthofen believes in fighting a war the ""gentleman"" way. ""We down planes, not pilots."" he says, giving his enemies the chance to land their wrecked plane safely. He is outraged during a scene in the movie when his cocky brother is seen directly over the airfield, gunning down a helpless British plane and murdering the pilot when it was already apparent that the British plane was going down anyway. The German ruler, Kaiser Wilhelm II, is impressed with him, telling him in one scene, ""The ladies must be all over you.""""Not many ladies are up at 10,000 feet."" the Baron says, drawing laughter from the surprised Kaiser and his staff.But finally, an attractive nurse named Kate, who even tends to the Baron as well when he is injured, opens his eyes and shows him what the war really has to offer. So many hospitals, that they all have to be numbered, and full to the brim with wounded men, most of which will soon die.The war soon goes into the massive German spring offensive of 1918. You see the Baron and his planes chewing up the entire British air fleet overhead, but the war is different on the ground, where the Baron can easily see advancing German infantry being cut into ribbons by British machine guns. He even tells a German general before the offensive that he thinks Germany must surrender. ""You know how I became the victor of 63 aerial battles? Every time I got into a fight that I could not win, I flew away."" He tells the same to his own pilots, to disengage from battles that they clearly have no advantage of over the enemy, but the Generals are not impressed. Even though the enemy respects and fears him, the Baron seems to sense that his own end is near, and flies on his final mission. His death is credited to Captain Roy Brown of the Canadian Flying Corps, a pilot he had encountered twice earlier in the war and in the movie, where he helps the wounded Captain Brown out of a wrecked plane, and then when both men face each other in battle and force each other down, where both men have a respectful chat before the Baron points him to where his lines will be.Such a sad end to the Baron's life and flying career, but also a great movie to span his achievements all within 2 hours! This movie was excellent and is recommended to anyone who liked watching ""Flyboys.""
