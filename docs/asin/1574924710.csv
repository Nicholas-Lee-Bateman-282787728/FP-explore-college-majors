Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","IN THE PRESENCE OF MINE ENEMIES (television film, 1997, written by Rod Serling, 90 minutes) is a strange, excessively stage-like piece centered in the Warsaw ghetto. It is 1942 and the NAZI presence is poised to destroy the Polish Jews. The focus is the rabbi (an unusually intense Armin Mueller-Stahl) who slowly loses his grip on his own humanity.The problem I have with such films is they try far too much to take the viewer into the pain of the subject, the horror of the era and the evil. This is a thing that must never be forgotten, never be repeated - but THIS kind of representation is not the way to do it. The example is in the rabbi himself - struggling to keep the community sane in the face of NAZI insanity, trying to ground the people who have to see dead loved ones in the street every day.Ultimately I must respect this work and its effort, the artless yet compelling drama that sits, quietly and horrifically like a storm on the horizon. The film made me weep, made me angry and on top of it all, I find it to be a somewhat tasteless, poorly acted theatrical piece. In the long list of what I call ""Jewish suffering film"", I put this one at the very bottom.As a matter of interest, I think this is the first movie Armin did that caught the eye of American audiences. His next appearance - which is the first time I ever saw him - was as the villanous former NAZI Strugholdt in the firstThe X-Files: Fight the Futuremovie. He has appeared in nothing (that I know of) since 2009, and the latest appearance of his I can recall is inAngels & Demonsas the cardinal.",3,Blessed is the True Judge,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,1579,"['IN', 'THE', 'PRESENCE', 'OF', 'MINE', 'ENEMIES', 'television', 'film', '1997', 'written', 'Rod', 'Serling', '90', 'minutes', 'strange', 'excessively', 'stage-like', 'piece', 'centered', 'Warsaw', 'ghetto', '1942', 'NAZI', 'presence', 'poised', 'destroy', 'Polish', 'Jews', 'focus', 'rabbi', 'unusually', 'intense', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'who', 'slowly', 'grip', 'own', 'humanity.The', 'problem', 'have', 'such', 'films', 'try', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'viewer', 'pain', 'subject', 'horror', 'era', 'evil', 'thing', 'must', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'never', 'be', 'repeated', 'THIS', 'kind', 'representation', 'not', 'way', 'do', 'example', 'rabbi', 'struggling', 'keep', 'community', 'sane', 'face', 'NAZI', 'insanity', 'trying', 'ground', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'see', 'dead', 'loved', 'ones', 'street', 'day.Ultimately', 'must', 'respect', 'work', 'effort', 'artless', 'yet', 'compelling', 'drama', 'quietly', 'horrifically', 'storm', 'horizon', 'film', 'made', 'weep', 'made', 'angry', 'top', 'find', 'be', 'somewhat', 'tasteless', 'poorly', 'acted', 'theatrical', 'piece', 'long', 'list', 'what', 'call', 'Jewish', 'suffering', 'film', 'put', 'one', 'very', 'matter', 'interest', 'think', 'first', 'movie', 'Armin', 'did', 'caught', 'eye', 'American', 'audiences', 'next', 'appearance', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'was', 'villanous', 'former', 'NAZI', 'Strugholdt', 'firstThe', 'X-Files', 'Fight', 'Futuremovie', 'appeared', 'nothing', 'know', '2009', 'latest', 'appearance', 'can', 'recall', 'inAngels', 'Demonsas', 'cardinal']",N/A

191297,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,1574924710,Z Hayes,"[24, 25]","In The Presence of Mine Enemies centers around a Jewish family in the last days of the Warsaw Ghetto. It is November 1942, and most of the Jews in the ghetto have been deported. We are introduced to Rabbi Adam Heller [Armin Mueller Stahl] and his daughter Rachel[Elina Lowensohn] who try to live as quietly as they can, evading the dreaded transports for as long as possible. The Kommandant is portrayed as an evil, merciless character who has no qualms sending children to their deaths and has his eye set on Rachel. Chad Lowe portrays a young Nazi officer who proclaims that Jews are 'subhumans' yet acts contrary to his beliefs. He refuses to hit the Rabbi, and though is forced to obey the cruel whims of his superior, the Kommandant, does so against his conscience.The story centers mainly on the struggles of Rabbi Heller who tries to remain passive and accepting of the dire circumstances of his people in the ghetto, yet a chain of incidents challenge not only his passivity but also his very faith. When his own daughter falls prey to an evil nazi, his son Paul [already imbued with vitriolic hatred towards the Germans ""We need to kill ten German babies for each one of ours""] challenges his father's deep faith and mocks his father's belief in God.Though this movie is based on a work of fiction, it definitely resonates with one's emotions, and the credible cast of characters [except perhaps the besotted young Nazi played by Lowe] make this a worthy addition to movies dealing with the Holocaust theme.",4,A Holocaust movie that depicts the struggles of faith & hope,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1516,"['Presence', 'Mine', 'Enemies', 'centers', 'Jewish', 'family', 'last', 'days', 'Warsaw', 'Ghetto', 'November', '1942', 'most', 'Jews', 'ghetto', 'have', 'been', 'deported', 'are', 'introduced', 'Rabbi', 'Adam', 'Heller', '[', 'Armin', 'Mueller', 'Stahl', ']', 'daughter', 'Rachel', '[', 'Elina', 'Lowensohn', ']', 'who', 'try', 'live', 'as', 'quietly', 'can', 'evading', 'dreaded', 'transports', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'Kommandant', 'portrayed', 'evil', 'merciless', 'character', 'who', 'qualms', 'sending', 'children', 'deaths', 'eye', 'set', 'Rachel', 'Chad', 'Lowe', 'young', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'who', 'Jews', 'are', ""'subhumans"", 'yet', 'contrary', 'beliefs', 'hit', 'Rabbi', 'though', 'forced', 'obey', 'cruel', 'whims', 'superior', 'Kommandant', 'so', 'conscience.The', 'story', 'centers', 'mainly', 'struggles', 'Rabbi', 'Heller', 'who', 'remain', 'passive', 'accepting', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'people', 'ghetto', 'chain', 'incidents', 'challenge', 'not', 'only', 'passivity', 'also', 'very', 'faith', 'When', 'own', 'daughter', 'prey', 'evil', 'nazi', 'son', 'Paul', '[', 'already', 'imbued', 'vitriolic', 'hatred', 'Germans', 'need', 'kill', 'ten', 'German', 'babies', 'one', 'ours', ']', 'father', 'deep', 'faith', 'mocks', 'father', 'belief', 'God.Though', 'movie', 'based', 'work', 'fiction', 'definitely', 'one', 'emotions', 'credible', 'cast', 'characters', '[', 'perhaps', 'besotted', 'young', 'Nazi', 'played', 'Lowe', ']', 'make', 'worthy', 'addition', 'movies', 'dealing', 'Holocaust', 'theme']",N/A
