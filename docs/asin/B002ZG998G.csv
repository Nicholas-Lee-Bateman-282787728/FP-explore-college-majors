In this stinker of a movie, Gerard Butler plays a former cop turned bounty hunter who gets the job of taking his ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston, to jail on an outstanding warrant for a minor traffic accident.  Along the way, Aniston, who plays a reporter, stumbles into a murder mystery which endangers her life and the life of Gerard Butler.If Aniston and Butler were supposed to be funny or have any chemistry in this film, it didn't happen!  The plot ended up being stupid and unrealistic.  There were plenty of plot holes, and by halfway through the movie, I wanted both characters to be thrown in jail and the key thrown away just because they were both so rude, self-centered, and mean.I definitely wouldn't include this film on my resume if I was Jennifer Aniston or Gerard Butler.  Instead, I would simply hope that people would eventually forget this movie and forgive me for wasting an hour and a half of their lives watching it.

Seriously, there is nothing here that you can't find in a million other movies, and to be quite frank, it isn't done remarkably well here either.  I'm beginning to understand the complaint that Jennifer Aniston is not a film star.  She is a remarkable sitcom actress, and if she ever decides to delve back into TV I'll be first in line to check out her new show, but there are certain things that don't translate so well from small screen to big screen (see the `Sex and the City' movie for all the details) and there is something about Aniston's personality that fits in that boat of `made for TV'.  It just doesn't read so well on the big screen (she has exceptions, but they are few).  Butler is not a great actor, but he looks good and has an accent so he is obviously `in' right now.  I'd watch him do practically anything, but outside of his looks he doesn't have a lot of appeal (although I found him surprisingly tender in `P.S. I Love You'...why don't I own that movie?).  The plot here is a bit bland.  Why is it that these new romantic comedy marriage flicks all have to involve people trying to kill you; like the only way you can rekindle your romantic relations is if you save each other from death.  It just seems odd to me.  Thankfully that `Have you Heard About the Morgans' movie knew how to handle it better than this film.  It feels clumsy here.  Also, this is a rom-com...nothing more and so I find it off putting that they even try and make a statement about marriage (the whole dinner scene was out of place).  In the end there are some scenes that really work and others that fall flat.  Since when did Cathy Moriarty turn into Kathleen Turner?  That was a letdown.  And `The Hangover' certainly proved that Jason Sudeikis deserves much better than this (he was SOOOOO good in that movie).  Thankfully Carol Kane called Aniston stinky, for that was the only time I truly LOL'd during this movie.",2,Hunt a little longer and you'll find a better movie to rent...,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,2060,"['really', 'good', 'thing', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'are', 'so', 'charming', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'complete', 'disaster', 'Seriously', 'nothing', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'million', 'other', 'movies', 'be', 'quite', 'frank', ""n't"", 'done', 'remarkably', 'well', 'here', 'either', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'understand', 'complaint', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'not', 'film', 'star', 'remarkable', 'sitcom', 'actress', 'ever', 'delve', 'back', 'TV', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'line', 'check', 'out', 'new', 'show', 'are', 'certain', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'so', 'well', 'small', 'screen', 'big', 'screen', 'see', 'Sex', 'City', 'movie', 'details', 'something', 'Aniston', 'personality', 'boat', 'made', 'TV', 'just', ""n't"", 'read', 'so', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'exceptions', 'are', 'few', 'Butler', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'good', 'accent', 'so', 'obviously', 'right', 'now', ""'d"", 'watch', 'do', 'practically', 'anything', 'looks', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'appeal', 'found', 'surprisingly', 'tender', 'P.S', 'Love', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'movie', 'plot', 'here', 'bit', 'bland', 'Why', 'new', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'marriage', 'flicks', 'have', 'involve', 'people', 'trying', 'kill', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'rekindle', 'romantic', 'relations', 'save', 'other', 'death', 'just', 'odd', 'Thankfully', 'Have', 'Heard', 'Morgans', 'movie', 'knew', 'how', 'handle', 'better', 'film', 'clumsy', 'here', 'Also', 'rom-com', 'nothing', 'more', 'so', 'find', 'off', 'putting', 'even', 'try', 'make', 'statement', 'marriage', 'whole', 'dinner', 'scene', 'was', 'place', 'end', 'are', 'scenes', 'really', 'work', 'others', 'fall', 'flat', 'when', 'did', 'Cathy', 'Moriarty', 'turn', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'was', 'letdown', 'Hangover', 'certainly', 'proved', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'SOOOOO', 'good', 'movie', 'Thankfully', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'called', 'Aniston', 'stinky', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'truly', 'LOL', ""'d"", 'movie']",N/A

That's good enough for me; if you love her or Gerard Butler AND you are seeing it with your kids or your loved one, then it is good enough(though just good enough).  No, it is not Gladiator, Ben Hur, or Doctor Zhivago...it is not intended to be timeless, or to age like fine wine.  It is an ""outing"" for these stars to make a film and for us to see it.  If you are going with the intention of taking notes and judging it on an absolute scale of cinematic quality, then skip it...save your money.  However, if you just want to take a break from something(shopping?  school?), it is a pleasant diverson.  My real objection is that I could not believe a woman as fantastic as Jennifer Anniston(OK, I'm a fan) would ever go back to, or ever have been associated with, Gerard Butler.  His demeanor and appearance in the film is abhorrent compared to the, as usual, flawless Ms. Anniston.  Of all of Ms. Anniston's films, this is the only one where we get the slightest glimmer of her sex appeal.

Jennifer Aniston has the opposite problem; she frequently 'takes risks', working to avoid type-casting from ""Friends"", which has resulted in several remarkable performances (""The Break-Up"" is wonderfully nuanced), but here, she resorts to mugging and pratfalls to hide the weaknesses of a shallow script. Baranski (as Aniston's 'cougar' mom), and Kane (as innkeeper at the hotel where Butler and Aniston had spent their honeymoon) are two of America's finest comic actresses, but Tennant largely fails to capitalize on their formidable skills.""The Bounty Hunter"" has all the charm of a TV sitcom episode, without the clever editing or pacing.

Sarah Thorp wrote this ambiguous tale and Andy Tennant (who ha done some good movies) 'directed' it and likely the only reason it ever made it into theaters lies in the decision to place name actors in the leads.  That doesn't even help.Milo Boyd (Gerard Butler, grossly miscast) is an ex-cop turned bounty hunter whose track record is less than acceptable. He lands a chance to redeem his failing career when he is assigned to bring in his bail-jumping ex-wife, a news reporter Nicole Hurly (Jennifer Anniston) whose 'crime' is as foolish as the script. The 'cute twist' is that Milo and Nicole were married but found their commitment to work a barricade in maintaining their marriage.  The rest of the film is Milo chasing down Nicole who happens to be tracking a news story on a criminal and somewhere along the way the two have moments of reconciliation quickly botched by the clumsiness of Milo's bounty hunter abilities and Nicole's investigating warps. The chase becomes more of a stagy thriller than the intended comedy romance - and there is absolutely no chemistry between Aniston and Butler on the screen.Tiny cameos are embarrassing, even in the hands of actors such as Christine Baranski, Cathy Moriarty, and Gio Perez.

1311172,A1ULMFI7GNVPZM,B002ZG998G,"J. Beins ""Diversity Encouraged""","[4, 6]","The Bounty Hunter is a pleasant afternoon diversion, a 2-1/2 to 3 (although I gave it five cause I'm tired of it being the poster child for bad movies.)  It's not bad, just not great.  If you like the stars (and I like BOTH Butler and Aniston) it's OK.  It has a lot of cute moments but doesn't gel as a whole for some reason.That reason, I think, can be laid at the door of the producers/director.  Anytime a film doesn't measure up to people's expectations, critics, bloggers, man/woman on the street always lambast the stars.  Well, there are plenty of stars I don't care for, but I really don't think it's their fault, certainly not here.  The producers choose the script (here mild to say the least), the stars, the budget, the director.  It's their ballgame but they get to fade away and leave the talent holding the bag.This film was poorly directed.  Yes, I know he's had other successes but here he dropped the ball.  Cute moments are allowed to lay there, the incidental music drains any sense of fun (the songs are cute but the rest is just bad), locations are drab and lifeless and poorly used.  And the fact that the film actually plays a lot better on TV leads me to my second assertion.The producers/director were not tailoring this film for theaters.  Their sites were set on its perpetual play on cable, it's life on TV.  It is a classy TV movie, already honed to not upset anyone in their living room, tailor made for commercial interuption when that fate befalls it, and cute enough but not too distractive when you have to answer the phone or put the kids to bed - again.I like Butler, a lot, and I like Aniston.  And if I don't like somebody I don't watch their films nor do I whine about them every chance I get (In other words, those who don't like Aniston - or anybody else - DON'T WATCH HER MOVIES. Sheesh!)  Butler and Aniston are good but too sanitized in this outing.  A little more edge would have helped a lot, a stronger central threat, a sharper paced rhythm (the director again).

He's not bad here and he has chemistry with Aniston. Still, I can't say he was made for romantic comedies. He's a macho brute, not that there's anything wrong that, but he lacks charm in films like the Ugly Truth and now the Bounty Hunter. Being a macho brute worked more for him in movies like 300 and Rocknrolla but not romantic comedies.It is strange that he toned down his machoness in Nim's Island though and managed to have some charm in that.

HOT GERRY!  HOT GERRY like the GERRY stripping in PS I LOVE YOU.  So, mistake number one---why isn't GERRY HOT!  Slob Gerry is what we got and---wrong.  Who is running Hollywood?  Why would you pay good coin to have him sloshing around.  The story line would have worked just as well if he had been a classy bounty hunter with a Jaguar who adored his car, made his bounty lick the dirt from it---worked better by the end when his precious Jag is torn to shreds.  He could still have needed money, still have been a gambler with a bad loss and a need for some fast cash.  He could have been in cuff links and white shirts and just plain HOT!  HOT!  HOT!  I kept looking at those tennis shoes and thinking of the Millionaire Matchmaker saying, ""Nobody wants to $%#$ that!""  Now that bathroom scene was what we were looking for.  C'mon!Jennifer was just wrong for this film---wrong. He needs to be opposite someone who is half-nuts and Jen-Jen is so controlled.I thought the story line was good---badly filmed, badly directed, badly cast---but I could see it as a really good comedic novel.  I think it could have been a good film.Having said all of the above---I'm glad I saw it.  I'm giving it 4 stars, even though it probably was under three, but hey---there's Gerry half naked in the bathroom scene---that's worth a star and a half.

You take your rifle and get your ten shots missing everything, not winning a single prize.  That is what I felt like when I watched ""The Bounty Hunter"".  It was painful to see two actors that I actually enjoy on most occasions fail so miserable at the attempt to create any on screen chemistry.  Setting aside a couple of laughs on occasion the movie had no depth, little plot and nothing endearing.  It was difficult to watch at times.Nicole Hurley (Jennifer Aniston) is a reporter for a local newspaper.  She is divorced from Milo Boyd (Gerard Butler) who used to be a top notch detective, but is now a local bail bondsman.  He was fired from the police force for doing something that was never really clear.  The two of them dislike each other immensely.  You can guess most of the plot from here without me going too much further but alas, it is what I do.Nicole, since she is a woman, can't drive that well and grazed the horse of a mounted police officer.  She was set to go to court but missed her designated time.  After several extensions from the judge she finally had her bail revoked, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.  Milo was assigned the case to bring her in for the sum of $5,000.  Damn, I would track somebody down for that much money.  Nicole, found herself not only being tracked by her ex-husband Milo but she was now also being stalked by some vicious killers.She had been working on a new story about a suicide that didn't actually seem like a suicide.  When she got to close to figuring something out, she found herself on the run.  Milo and Nicole devote most of their energy fighting each other in the beginning, but after both of their lives are threatened they pull forces to fight the bad guys.  They bicker, fall in the water at a golf course, rip a bed apart and end up falling back in love.  It makes you wonder what happened the first time around to make them hate each other so much.I happen to like romantic comedies.  I like Jennifer Aniston.  I like Gerard Butler.  I didn't like this movie.  As I left the theater I wondered what ever possessed me to walk in to begin with.  It was grossly disappointing.  I would give it a couple of stars for a few laughs and just for old times' sake, but I sure hope these two don't make another movie together for a long time.  Sometimes on screen chemistry works and sometimes it just needs to be saved for real life.  Uhhhhh, well, maybe that didn't work either I guess.I will say this; Jennifer Aniston still has some of the best legs of any woman any age.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[6, 8]","Well, I see I am not the only one who is compelled to dis ""The Bounty Hunter,"" starring those two usually popular stars. When I go to the movies (or in this case, rent one), I want to get lost in the flicker of the lights, the darkness of the theater, with a great, or even just a pretty good story.But no-o-o-o-, that does not happen here. None of that happens here. Nothing but cynicism, even toward my boy Gerard Butler. And Jennifer Aniston? My opinion is perhaps permanently sealed of her as a bratty, conceited, self-indulgent adolescent. And that hair? Normally, I can admire beautiful hair with the best or worst of them. But her hair? It is so annoying! How many times did she push it away from her face? I found myself even thinking of her hair as straggly!And my boy? Why that shirt? Since we had to watch the entire movie with Gerry wearing the same shirt, why couldn't he have worn a prettier shirt, not that skimpy, cheap-looking one? And who picked that form-fitting little black dress that we must endure seeing Jennifer wear for the entire movie? Just because she still has a nice-looking figure? My thought: She's wearing it to show off her figure and her tan.See? It's not the silly plot or tacky vengeful actions each takes against the other that concerns the viewer--it's all these questions. Watching a movie should be an engrossing activity, not one filled with all these questions and thoughts. So, in lieu of a traditional review, I'm listing some:1. Why in the world did Gerard Butler want to be involved in such a stinker of a movie? Oh, no need to answer. Jennifer Aniston would also star in it. Since Gerry has become such a playboy, having the opportunity of working opposite such an attractive sitcom queen must have been too much to turn down. If the gossip rags are right, the two did spend time together.2. I wish I had not seen the movie. Now my opinion of Jennifer as a one-dimensional actress is sealed. For the entire movie she is pouty and petulant. Frankly, in this story, she acts like a bratty adolescent instead of a professional journalist. She was never convincing. In fact, she exudes desperation and sorrow and loss. At least, that's my opinion.3. That shirt and that black dress. I really tired of seeing them. Here's my question: Were the shirt and dress washed daily for the next shoot (yeah, right), or were there racks of black dresses and skimpy, plaid shirts lined up, waiting for the next day?4. Two scenes with Jennifer: running in high heels? A double? And pumping away on that big tricycle in a short dress and high heels. Not believable and certainly not funny. More so, sad and pitiful.Well, you get the idea. I don't even know why I'm giving two stars. Generous, I guess. I didn't even realize how much I did not like this movie until I stayed the night at my mother's house. My brother and I were discussing which movie to rent. When he suggested ""The Bounty Hunter,"" all these negatives began spewing from my mouth.

Jennifer Anniston (Nicole) is a newspaper reporter who is currently on $50,000 bail for assaulting a mounted police officer, or his horse.  And BTW, they were married about 3 years ago, and divorced after about 9 months.  While the movie begins in NYC and is tied to NY, much of the movie takes place on the Atlantic City Boardwalk and around the casinos.Nicole is investigating a story about a suicide that sounds fishy.  She arrives at court with 4 minutes to spare.  When she gets a call from a snitch, she stupidly runs off instead of going to court.  The judge orders a bench warrant for her and she becomes a fugitive.  The bail bondsman offers Milo $5,000 to go get her.  Because there is plenty of leftover passionate anger between the couple, Milo is only too happy to go after her--besides, he needs the money.  His $11,000 gambling debt is overdue and, well, they break your legs for stuff like that.Meanwhile, the bad guys don't like Nicole investigating the so-called suicide, so they come after her.  Through Milo chasing Nicole and the bad guys chasing both of them, there is also a wanna-be love interest following Nicole because she made out with him one night while she was blitzed at a party.I like both these actors and it was good to see them do a movie together.  It's a wild and crazy story.

1311196,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG998G,Mark Turner,"[25, 27]","There are a large number of movies released starring big name stars that just never seem to quite live up to their potential. The movie that is, not the stars. And I don't think it's the fault of the stars either. Some would say it's a combination of script, direction and more but in general I don't think its any one item. It's a combination of them all and perhaps just a lackluster idea that seemed better on paper. Such is the case with THE BOUNTY HUNTER.Gerard Butler stars as Milo Boyd, a down on his luck bounty hunter deep in debt to bookies who never seems to have much luck. Having just caught a bail jumper the end result is a night in jail for torching a parade float on accident while attempting to catch the guy.Nicole Hurley (Jennifer Aniston) is a hot shot reporter who thinks she's on to a major story. An apparent suicide left behind too many questions that no one seems to be asking. As Nicole is about to go before a judge for an assault charge (what that involves is revealed later and it's not as funny as it should be) when she gets a call from an informant. Since she doesn't show for her hearing, her bail is revoked and she's a wanted fugitive.Guess who gets to pick her up for jumping bail? Of course it's Milo, who also just happens to be Nicole's ex-husband. Yes the pair had a parting of the ways and one gets the idea that it wasn't an easygoing divorce. No, both parties seem to not think well of the other. And when Milo tosses Nicole into the trunk of his car to take her in, things don't get a lot better.As the film moves forward, Milo eventually sees the problems that Nicole is having between trying to find clues to her story that might involve a best friend they both share as well as being shot at by someone who wants this story silenced. Along the way he keeps Nicole handcuffed to the bed at night and has to dodge his own problem, the bookies he owes money to. Somehow the only solutions to their problems is to stick together and figure things out.This is the type of movie where you know from the first scene that a happy ending is just around the corner no matter how many guns are drawn and how many shots are fired. Goldie Hawn made several films in this genre including FOUL PLAY and BIRD ON A WIRE. A combination of agitation between the two main characters, remembering the past, romance, adventure and the chance that someone might separate the characters that were apart for good by the final reel. But that never happens.Butler is coming along well with his career but his choices aren't always what he probably hoped for. He's taken a chance with comedy in a couple of films now and though he does an excellent job, he seems more suited for things like 300. Aniston has never seemed to make the leap from small to large screen like many actresses. Which is sad because she genuinely does a good job in everything she's done and this film is no exception.So what's the problem? The directing is fine, the photography well done and the acting, as state, well above par. I think perhaps the problem lies in the script. The two characters reveal so little of themselves in a positive light that you tend not to care about them. You hope they get back together but know so little of them as the story unfolds. The small glimpses you get are very small indeed.These are characters that we need to feel for, to understand, to want the best for and until late in the film we never have those emotions touched. Instead we witness two self absorbed people who whine about one another and blame each other for everything that went wrong. It's the Bickersons without the humor.The laughs are short term and unmemorable. The action is predictable. And the whodunit that the movie surrounds itself around to make it all worthwhile isn't nearly as crafty as it would like us to believe.All that being said, the movie isn't a bad film and definitely worth a dollar rental. Its just not one of those movies that you'll want to sit on the front shelf and pull down now and then. You may enjoy watching these two gifted actors perform well together once, but long term this isn't a movie you'll add to the collection unless you're a die hard Butler or Aniston fan. So enjoy the small amount of entertainment you get from this one and then let it fly. Perhaps the next movie that arrives in this genre will gel better than this one though.",2,PARTIAL DELIVERY,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,4377,"['are', 'large', 'number', 'movies', 'released', 'starring', 'big', 'name', 'just', 'never', 'seem', 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'movie', 'not', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fault', 'stars', 'would', 'say', 'combination', 'script', 'direction', 'more', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'item', 'combination', 'perhaps', 'just', 'lackluster', 'idea', 'seemed', 'better', 'paper', 'Such', 'case', 'THE', 'BOUNTY', 'HUNTER.Gerard', 'Butler', 'Milo', 'Boyd', 'down', 'luck', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'deep', 'debt', 'bookies', 'who', 'never', 'have', 'much', 'luck', 'Having', 'just', 'caught', 'bail', 'jumper', 'end', 'result', 'night', 'jail', 'torching', 'parade', 'float', 'accident', 'attempting', 'catch', 'guy.Nicole', 'Hurley', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'hot', 'shot', 'reporter', 'who', 'major', 'story', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'left', 'behind', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'one', 'be', 'asking', 'Nicole', 'go', 'judge', 'assault', 'charge', 'what', 'revealed', 'later', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'should', 'be', 'when', 'call', 'informant', ""n't"", 'show', 'hearing', 'bail', 'revoked', 'wanted', 'fugitive.Guess', 'who', 'pick', 'up', 'jumping', 'bail', 'course', 'Milo', 'who', 'also', 'just', 'be', 'Nicole', 'ex-husband', 'Yes', 'pair', 'had', 'parting', 'ways', 'one', 'idea', 'was', ""n't"", 'easygoing', 'divorce', 'No', 'parties', 'seem', 'not', 'think', 'well', 'other', 'when', 'Milo', 'Nicole', 'trunk', 'car', 'take', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'film', 'forward', 'Milo', 'eventually', 'problems', 'Nicole', 'having', 'trying', 'find', 'clues', 'story', 'might', 'involve', 'best', 'friend', 'share', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'shot', 'someone', 'who', 'story', 'silenced', 'way', 'Nicole', 'handcuffed', 'bed', 'night', 'dodge', 'own', 'problem', 'bookies', 'money', 'Somehow', 'only', 'solutions', 'problems', 'stick', 'together', 'figure', 'things', 'out.This', 'type', 'movie', 'where', 'know', 'first', 'scene', 'happy', 'ending', 'just', 'corner', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'guns', 'are', 'drawn', 'how', 'many', 'shots', 'are', 'fired', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'made', 'several', 'films', 'genre', 'including', 'FOUL', 'PLAY', 'BIRD', 'ON', 'A', 'WIRE', 'combination', 'agitation', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'remembering', 'past', 'romance', 'adventure', 'chance', 'someone', 'might', 'separate', 'characters', 'were', 'apart', 'good', 'final', 'reel', 'never', 'happens.Butler', 'coming', 'along', 'well', 'career', 'choices', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'what', 'probably', 'hoped', 'taken', 'chance', 'comedy', 'couple', 'films', 'now', 'excellent', 'job', 'more', 'suited', 'things', '300', 'Aniston', 'never', 'seemed', 'make', 'leap', 'small', 'large', 'screen', 'many', 'actresses', 'Which', 'sad', 'genuinely', 'good', 'job', 'everything', 'done', 'film', 'exception.So', 'what', 'problem', 'directing', 'fine', 'photography', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'state', 'well', 'par', 'think', 'perhaps', 'problem', 'script', 'two', 'characters', 'reveal', 'so', 'little', 'positive', 'light', 'tend', 'not', 'care', 'hope', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'know', 'so', 'little', 'story', 'unfolds', 'small', 'glimpses', 'get', 'are', 'very', 'small', 'indeed.These', 'are', 'characters', 'need', 'feel', 'understand', 'want', 'best', 'late', 'film', 'never', 'have', 'emotions', 'touched', 'Instead', 'witness', 'two', 'absorbed', 'people', 'who', 'whine', 'one', 'blame', 'other', 'everything', 'went', 'wrong', 'Bickersons', 'humor.The', 'laughs', 'are', 'short', 'term', 'unmemorable', 'action', 'predictable', 'whodunit', 'movie', 'make', 'worthwhile', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'crafty', 'would', 'like', 'believe.All', 'being', 'said', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'dollar', 'rental', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'want', 'sit', 'front', 'shelf', 'pull', 'down', 'now', 'then', 'may', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'two', 'gifted', 'actors', 'perform', 'well', 'together', 'once', 'long', 'term', ""n't"", 'movie', ""'ll"", 'add', 'collection', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'Butler', 'Aniston', 'fan', 'So', 'enjoy', 'small', 'amount', 'entertainment', 'get', 'one', 'then', 'let', 'fly', 'Perhaps', 'next', 'movie', 'genre', 'will', 'gel', 'better', 'one', 'though']",N/A

In fact, it's probably one of the worst films of 2010.Jennifer Aniston plays Nicole, the bail-jumping ex-wife of Gerard Butler's Milo, a fired cop who has since become a bounty hunter. He takes the assignment to pick his ex wife up, and take her to jail. But, somewhere down the line, a bunch of incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo about a murder, a cover-up, and other scoff-worthy cliches cause the two of them to flee, and of course, romance ensues, and it leads the two talented stars into the clutches of rom-com hell.This is a film that simply tries too hard to be funny, exciting, romantic, and entertaining. It is entertaining for about the first half-hour, and then starts a downward spiral from which it never recovers. It's a shame that Jennifer Aniston, who has been in top form, for the past five years, giving glowing performances in every film she's been in (Friends With Money, The Break-Up, The Good Girl) chose a dud like this. I'm glad to say that her comic gifts have yet to leave her, however her ability to pick a good one seems to be long gone.The characters in this film could have been so well-written and so interesting, but unfortunately, the lazy writers didn't know what to do with them, and it makes me wonder how detailed the script was anyway. While Aniston's character was somewhat interesting in the film's first act, Butler's character was the most revolting stereotype that I've seen in a film this year. He played the jackass. No more, no less. His character didn't take one unexpected move, or one unforeseen turn.The one redeeming quality that this film had lied in its supporting cast. Curb Your Enthusiasm's Jeff Garlin and Christine Baranski have about five minutes of screentime a piece, and they bring more life to the table than the rest of the cast does in a painful 110 minutes. While Butler should just stay as far away from the romantic comedy genre as possible, and while Aniston simply needs a better manager, they both look as attractive and gorgeous as ever. There's nothing else for either of them in this disaster, however.",1,"An unfunny, cringe-worthy cinematic trainwreck",1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,2350,"['n', 'year', 'where', 'American', 'film', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'flocking', 'sub-par', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'action', 'hybrids', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'worse', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'more', 'unlikable', 'more', 'unromantic', 'more', 'farfetched', 'more', 'unfunny', 'Bounty', 'Hunter', 'fact', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'films', '2010.Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'plays', 'Nicole', 'bail-jumping', 'ex-wife', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Milo', 'fired', 'cop', 'who', 'become', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'assignment', 'pick', 'ex', 'wife', 'up', 'take', 'jail', 'somewhere', 'line', 'bunch', 'incomprehensible', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'murder', 'cover-up', 'other', 'scoff-worthy', 'cliches', 'cause', 'two', 'flee', 'course', 'romance', 'ensues', 'two', 'talented', 'stars', 'clutches', 'rom-com', 'hell.This', 'film', 'simply', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'exciting', 'romantic', 'entertaining', 'entertaining', 'first', 'half-hour', 'then', 'downward', 'spiral', 'never', 'shame', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'been', 'top', 'form', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'giving', 'glowing', 'performances', 'film', 'been', 'Friends', 'Money', 'Break-Up', 'Good', 'Girl', 'chose', 'dud', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'comic', 'gifts', 'have', 'yet', 'leave', 'however', 'ability', 'pick', 'good', 'one', 'be', 'long', 'gone.The', 'characters', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'well-written', 'so', 'interesting', 'unfortunately', 'lazy', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'wonder', 'how', 'detailed', 'script', 'was', 'anyway', 'Aniston', 'character', 'was', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'film', 'first', 'act', 'Butler', 'character', 'was', 'most', 'revolting', 'stereotype', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'year', 'played', 'jackass', 'more', 'less', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'one', 'unexpected', 'move', 'one', 'unforeseen', 'turn.The', 'one', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'film', 'had', 'lied', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'Jeff', 'Garlin', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'have', 'five', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'piece', 'bring', 'more', 'life', 'table', 'rest', 'cast', 'painful', '110', 'minutes', 'Butler', 'should', 'just', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'possible', 'Aniston', 'simply', 'better', 'manager', 'look', 'attractive', 'gorgeous', 'ever', 'nothing', 'else', 'disaster', 'however']",N/A

The new generation of artists; Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, took away the monotony of watching the Travolta, Williams Robinsons, and Bruce Willis.  At least, with the new faces, you could enjoy the surprise of telling a totally new narrative of events, places, people, and social events.  The New York's diverse culture enriched the movie in every way you look at it. The drugs, gambling, smoking, tattoos, obesity, and rugged and troubled way of life and individuals brought all sorts of annoying and bizarre people that made the movie a condensed piece of reality.Aside from the movie narrative, the background of Queens, Atlantic City, and in-between documents the modern way of life of New York and its spill over Atlantic City.  Between the NYPD, the Court, the field of crime, and major attraction of Atlantic City, the movie narrative succeeded in putting the pieces of a struggling professional couple to stay married amidst the madness and fast pace of New York.The News crime reporter who was married to a police officer was trying to get by with her demanding job, new boy friend, and complying with strict court procedure.  The conflict between the three made her run afoul with the law.  Her ex-husband, who also lost his job with NYPD was lucky enough to land on a job to hunt his ex-wife and bring her to custody.  The two divorced couple would soon rediscover the hidden and untold secrets of their broken love.  During the struggle of restraining his ex-wife and bringing her to Queen's Police, the ex-husband was exposed to the limits of a human being to stand humiliation and despair. With the leads from outsiders, such as her ex-mother-in-law and other past acquaintances, the two divorced couple were getting closer and closer to unveil their own hidden defenses that made them lose their marriage.Each working on his own professional survival and trying to secure his and her own living, the two divorced couple were reunited with stronger and more transparent understanding of what made them love in the first place.",5,Another great piece of art of New York's lifestyle.,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,2110,"['fifth', 'movie', 'NYPD', 'saw', 'few', 'months', 'span', 'new', 'generation', 'artists', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'took', 'away', 'monotony', 'watching', 'Travolta', 'Williams', 'Robinsons', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'least', 'new', 'could', 'enjoy', 'surprise', 'telling', 'totally', 'new', 'narrative', 'events', 'places', 'people', 'social', 'events', 'New', 'York', 'diverse', 'culture', 'enriched', 'movie', 'way', 'look', 'drugs', 'gambling', 'smoking', 'tattoos', 'obesity', 'rugged', 'troubled', 'way', 'life', 'individuals', 'brought', 'sorts', 'annoying', 'bizarre', 'people', 'made', 'movie', 'condensed', 'piece', 'reality.Aside', 'movie', 'narrative', 'background', 'Queens', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'in-between', 'documents', 'modern', 'way', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'spill', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'NYPD', 'Court', 'field', 'crime', 'major', 'attraction', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'movie', 'narrative', 'succeeded', 'putting', 'pieces', 'struggling', 'professional', 'couple', 'stay', 'married', 'madness', 'fast', 'pace', 'New', 'York.The', 'News', 'crime', 'reporter', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'police', 'officer', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'demanding', 'job', 'new', 'boy', 'friend', 'complying', 'strict', 'court', 'procedure', 'conflict', 'three', 'made', 'run', 'afoul', 'law', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'also', 'lost', 'job', 'NYPD', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'land', 'job', 'hunt', 'ex-wife', 'bring', 'custody', 'two', 'divorced', 'couple', 'would', 'soon', 'rediscover', 'hidden', 'untold', 'secrets', 'broken', 'love', 'struggle', 'restraining', 'ex-wife', 'bringing', 'Queen', 'Police', 'ex-husband', 'was', 'exposed', 'limits', 'human', 'being', 'stand', 'humiliation', 'despair', 'leads', 'outsiders', 'such', 'ex-mother-in-law', 'other', 'past', 'acquaintances', 'two', 'divorced', 'couple', 'were', 'getting', 'closer', 'closer', 'unveil', 'own', 'hidden', 'defenses', 'made', 'lose', 'marriage.Each', 'working', 'own', 'professional', 'survival', 'trying', 'secure', 'own', 'living', 'two', 'divorced', 'couple', 'were', 'reunited', 'stronger', 'more', 'transparent', 'understanding', 'what', 'made', 'love', 'first', 'place']",N/A

Jennifer Aniston has yet to make a film that is capable of evoking any form of emotion in anyone with an average I.Q. This drivel is no exception. Not even taking into account the entire Brangelina/Aniston debacle, which makes you want to like her, Jennifer Aniston is a mediocre actress.

Instead, she needs a good script with substance and depth, that enables her to prove once and for all she can do more than flick her hair, smile sardonically, and be sarcastic. The standouts in this movie are the gorgeous Gerard Butler (who needs to practice his US accent); the wonderful Siobhan Fallon, whose expression alone cracks me up; and the absolutely priceless Christine Baranski, she makes me proud to be an older woman.

And yet, she continues to bring in the big bucks. Her last ten films since 2006 have grossed $770 Million in profit at the box office. I'm not making this up. People flock to go see her. Why?The studios put Aniston in their films because they're guaranteed to make a sizeable profit, regardless if the movie is good or not. ""Wanderlust"", her last film, flopped at the box office. Perhaps this is an encouraging sign. Maybe moviegoers have become weary of her films. I certainly have. I took a chance on this one, but should have known better.Aniston's last good film, ""The Good Girl"", was ten years ago. Before that she appeared in other critically acclaimed films such as ""The Iron Giant"" and ""Office Space"". These films are not rom-com's and perhaps they didn't rake in millions of dollars, but they did garner the actors who appeared in it valuable respect and admiration. Right now, Aniston is pretty much an industry punchline.Jennifer Aniston can be humorous. So either she's not getting the good, funny scripts, or romantic comedies are not a good vehicle for her comedic abilities. My advice to her would be to take a chance on something different.

Not the same old Jennifer Anniston, playing Rachel Green. Yes, she will always have that type of personality, 'cause that's who she is but I really like the chemistry between her and Gerard Butler for one thing. That's a big deal to me and I like a film where the characters actually grow, learn, change and move on-like they talked about when they had dinner together. Take responsibility for your #*%$ and move on. Also, I appreciated the fact that the few swear words were mild and the little bit of sexual innuendo was pretty tame. I also love Christina Baranski-she's fun no matter what she does but it would have been nice to see her and Anniston have a scene together (on the phone is not doing a scene together). The scene between Baranski and Butler was awesome, they even had chemistry. I also wonder how the actress who played Theresa managed to walk away without fainting when Butler dips her down for a passionate kiss after she hands him a check! Sigh! Now that was hot!I really love this film. I have a copy that I just put in now when I'm doing other stuff and have it running in the background. It's fun, it's fast, it's clever, and it's crazy. Oh, and most of the violence, directed at Jason Sudekis's, Stewart, is comedic and besides his character deserves it, he plays a dope, but a hilarious dope! At one point, he congratulates himself for something and says, 'Stewart, you a tremendous stud!' Hilarious! He's perfect for the part.This movie truely is funny and a little sappy. Give it a chance.

That film was made in 2005 and it is the most memorable reference to entice us to watch this new film? Pretty much, yes. That alone should set off warning signals.As I sat watching the film, I was just amazed how unfunny it is. Two people who hate each other because of a previous relationship gone badly are now forced to spend time together. There are two major problems with this concept. First, who finds it fun to watch two people argue, fight and hit each other? Second, you know they will get together in the end so there is no suspense in the film. Sounds like a fun time for all, huh?The other thing that occurred to me is that Jennifer Aniston is just unable to create any chemistry with Gerard Butler. Sure, he is also partially responsible for this, but he is, at least, trying to achieve the right tone for the film. Jovial and lighthearted. Aniston plays Nicole Hurley, a reporter for the Daily News who is trying to uncover a story involving corrupt cops. She is on a mission and very serious, so she doesn't want to let anyone or anything interfere. Unfortunately, when her ex-husband, Milo (Butler), a bounty hunter, receives a job to bring back Nicole, who has skipped bail, she doesn't change her demeanor or outlook at all. She never seems to smile or laugh or flirt. The only time she even approaches this type of behavior is when she is trying to convince Milo that she is interested in him so she can get his gun and break free to continue her investigation. Later, when their relationship reaches that inevitable stage where they are both gaga over one another, she seems like she has stepped into this film from a different movie. It is really strange. She is doing and saying the things you would expect, but since so much time was spent with the other Aniston, this one doesn't connect.As I sat through this film, I began to think back to other Aniston films. Have I ever seen her create any chemistry with any of her co-stars? In her last film, ""Management"", she never seems to truly love either Woody Harrelson or Steve Zahn's character. Worse, she seems to tolerate Zahn and put up with his shenanigans. This is a good point because a better actress would be able to convince us of why she is putting up with this guy, this loser, and all of his craziness. ""The Break-Up""? Again, fighting with her love interest for over two hours. ""Derailed"". If you are able to look past the extremely unsettling subject matter, a certified piece of crap. But even in this film, she can't make us believe she is in love or in lust with Clive Owen or Vincent Cassell. ""Rumor Has It""? Also a piece of crap. She was okay in ""He's Just Not That Into You"", but because it was an ensemble cast, she certainly can't be called the star and she didn't carry the film. In fact, ""The Good Girl"" and ""Friends With Money"", two small independent films are easily the best she has made but I can't remember any romantic fireworks in either.There has been a lot of press about the affair Aniston and Butler are having right now. They fell in love on the set and, apparently, are unable to keep their hands off one another, grabbing and touching each other on the red carpet. In front of paparazzi. When promoting this new film... They say that everything old is new again. This is exactly the same type of thing the major studios used to hire hundreds of people to orchestrate, to get publicity for their films. You connect the dots.Gerard Butler plays Milo, a former cop who now works as a bounty hunter. He seems to have fun with the role, giving his character a certain amount of playfulness and sarcasm. The film opens with Milo chasing one of his skips, a guy playing Uncle Sam in a Fourth of July parade. As Uncle Sam, walking on stilts, walks along with the parade, Milo spots him and starts to chase him. The guy begins running on the stilts and they soon end up in the middle of some cops. Milo makes a smart aleck remark to the cops and they both reveal a high level of animosity towards each other.Let's return to the director, Andy Tennant. Quick, besides the fact Will Smith starred in the film, name one thing about ""Hitch"" that you remember? I bet many would even have trouble coming up with the name of his female co-star. There are a few reasons why a studio would link a new film with a previous success. Obviously, they want the people who went to see ""Hitch"" and 'loved it' to think they will also love ""The Bounty Hunter"". But did anyone love ""Hitch"" or was it a success because of Will Smith's involvement? That's a rhetorical question by the way. Another reason is because the filmmaker is so brilliant the studio wants all of their devoted followers to know they have a new film coming out. But if a filmmaker is brilliant, they usually have name recognition followed by their last successful film. For instance, ""Shutter Island"" trumpeted ""The new Martin Scorcese film"" or ""From the director who brought you ""The Departed"""". Quite a difference. And the reason for this is Tennant's films are largely forgettable. His most memorable films, ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and ""First Kiss"" are sweet, if extremely predictable pieces of romantic fluff. Nothing he has ever made would make someone say ""Hey did you see this new film from this director, Andy Tennant?""Instead, we are more likely to say, ""Did you see the new Reese Witherspoon film?""Thankfully, when someone asks you if you saw the new Jennifer Aniston film you can happily report ""No, thornhill warned me not to.""",2,I'd Like To Collect A Bounty.

1311244,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002ZG998G,trebe,"[1, 2]","For Jennifer Anniston fans, The Bounty Hunter (2010) does at least offer a slight change of pace.  While not quite Knight And Day (2010), there's still enough action to separate the movie from the typical romantic comedy vehicles that Ms. Anniston usually appears in.  At 41, she looks fabulous, nicely tanned, and superbly toned.  The pairing of Anniston with Gerard Butler (300, The Phantom of the Opera), who plays a kind of rough around the edges type, makes for kind of an odd match, and is a switch from the pretty guys she's typically involved with.Reporter Nicole Hurley (Anniston) is on the trail of a big story involving corruption in the police department.  Ex-cop now bounty hunter Milo Boyd (Butler), is given the assignment of bringing in his ex-wife (Hurley) for jumping bail.  Boyd tracks down his ex at a racetrack and tosses her in the trunk of his car, with the intention of bringing her in.  A short stop in Atlantic City perks up their romance a bit, but Nicole is still on her way to the police station, when an attempt on their lives finally convinces Milo that Nicole might really be on to something.  The couple spend the rest of the film mostly working as a team, reliving their past, and eventually discovering the truth.Jason Sudeikis, Christine Baranski, Cathy Moriarty, and Carole Kane are among the supporting cast.  The Bounty Hunter isn't loaded with action, isn't hilariously funny, is just passable in the romance department, and has a terrible ending.  The writing isn't very clever, and Anniston and Butler don't seem to have the greatest chemistry together.  The result is a mildly entertaining romp, with a couple of pedestrian action sequences, and a few amusing moments.  Jennifer Anniston is extremely likeable, but remains a talent who has yet to find the ideal vehicle.  Though critically panned, The Bounty Hunter did well at the box office.  If you are an Anniston or Gerard Butler fan, you'll probably want to check this out.

1311246,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZG998G,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","""The Bounty Hunter"" is an example of a good Hollywood-made romantic comedy turned into a dull one. The film, directed by Andy Tennant (responsible much better ""Ever After"" and ""Hitch""), stars Gerald Butler and Jennifer Aniston. Butler is a cop-turned-bounty hunter Milo, whose newest assignment is to capture Nicole, a reporter working for a local paper - and she is his ex-wife - who has jumped bail to go after a story. While tracking down his divorced wife, Milo himself gets involved in the case Nicole is determined to investigate. And as you know, Nicole and Milo hate each other at first, but then something romantic happens again between them before the film reaches its inevitable conclusion.Don't get me wrong. The film's storyline is predictable, but it is fine with me. What annoys me here is the filmmakers added so many unnecessary things to the already contrived story that should have been much simpler. There is a subplot about Milo's gambling debt that goes nowhere. There is another subplot about Nicole's coworker Stewart (Jason Sudeikis) that is unfunny and embarrassing. As to the ""story"" Nicole investigates, it is simply boring.Even those who can ignore the weak story will be disappointed with the poorly-written characters Milo and Nicole. The two players themselves Gerald Butler and Jennifer Aniston are as attractive as ever, doing their best to save the film. Still the characters they play remain uninteresting throughout. Director Andy Tennant did a better job in ""Hitch,"" but his latest film lacks the charm and wit of the delightful Will Smith character.It seems ""The Bounty Hunter"" has borrowed so much from classic films as ""The African Queen"" and, more recently, ""Midnight Run.""

In this movie Gerard Butler plays a bounty hunter who was fired from the police department and one day the bounty comes up for his ex-wife played by Jennifer Aniston and the laughter begins.  Like I said before, it's a cute and fun show, the script was just ok & the acting was good.

She's not pretty in the least even with tne new nose job and the orange spray paint. The stringy, uncombed hair-do is bad enough on a lazy 16 yr old kid. Time to get an ADULT hairstyle, Jenny! Time to start ACTING your age, not the gushing, huffing 20-something in ""Friends."" You'll end up a washed up ""movie star"" in the next year or so (We can only HOPE!) with no kids, an army of failed one-night stands, and just a pile of money to keep you warm.Was I the only one who noticed she was acting to the audience, i.e. Brad, instead of inter-acting with her co-stars? She knows Brad's watching. He ain't comin' back, girl! He's got something a whole lot better than you right now.Why do producers throw money at her to star in movies that are losers from the first word on the script? She has a terrible track record, more losses an winners. She and Sarah Jessica Parker! WHY are these two homely women movie stars????? Look at them, with their long horse-faces, jawbones and chins, you could tie a rope around their heads, hook them to a mule and plow fields! Hey, wait, they might be better at thatAnd Gerard! What's up with you? You're gorgeous, can sing,  act, have incredible screen presence, and you show up in THIS thing? Do you need the money that bad? These movies will be on your resume' forever!!!And Hollywood, how many millions did you waste on this dreck? How many great scripts got passed over for this? I feel sorry for anyone who paid to see this thing. Luckily, I did not waste 2 hours, I changed channels in 10 minutes.Shame, shame, shame on everyone involved in this tripe!",1,Unforgiveable Garbage!,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,1659,"['Can', 'someone', 'please', 'tell', 'WHY', 'Jennifer', 'Anuston', 'movie', 'star', 'not', 'pretty', 'least', 'even', 'tne', 'new', 'nose', 'job', 'orange', 'spray', 'paint', 'stringy', 'uncombed', 'hair-do', 'bad', 'enough', 'lazy', '16', 'yr', 'old', 'kid', 'Time', 'get', 'ADULT', 'hairstyle', 'Jenny', 'Time', 'start', 'ACTING', 'age', 'not', 'gushing', 'huffing', '20-something', 'Friends', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'washed', 'movie', 'star', 'next', 'year', 'so', 'can', 'only', 'HOPE', 'kids', 'army', 'failed', 'one-night', 'stands', 'just', 'pile', 'money', 'keep', 'warm.Was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'noticed', 'was', 'acting', 'audience', 'i.e', 'Brad', 'instead', 'inter-acting', 'co-stars', 'Brad', 'watching', 'ai', ""n't"", 'comin', 'back', 'girl', 'got', 'something', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'right', 'now.Why', 'do', 'producers', 'throw', 'money', 'star', 'movies', 'are', 'losers', 'first', 'word', 'script', 'terrible', 'track', 'record', 'more', 'losses', 'winners', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'WHY', 'are', 'two', 'homely', 'women', 'movie', 'stars', 'Look', 'long', 'horse-faces', 'jawbones', 'chins', 'could', 'tie', 'rope', 'heads', 'hook', 'mule', 'plow', 'fields', 'Hey', 'wait', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'thatAnd', 'Gerard', 'What', 'up', ""'re"", 'gorgeous', 'can', 'sing', 'act', 'have', 'incredible', 'screen', 'presence', 'show', 'up', 'THIS', 'thing', 'Do', 'need', 'money', 'bad', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'resume', 'forever', 'Hollywood', 'how', 'many', 'millions', 'did', 'waste', 'dreck', 'How', 'many', 'great', 'scripts', 'got', 'passed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'anyone', 'who', 'paid', 'see', 'thing', 'Luckily', 'did', 'not', 'waste', '2', 'hours', 'changed', 'channels', '10', 'minutes.Shame', 'shame', 'shame', 'everyone', 'involved', 'tripe']",N/A
