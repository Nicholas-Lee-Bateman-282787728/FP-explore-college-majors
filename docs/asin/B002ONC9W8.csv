1281433,A30B0G0CIOOSQ2,B002ONC9W8,Erik Gfesser,"[20, 20]","While I was originally drawn to this movie because of the focus on an autistic boy (my son is one of the 1 in 91 who are on the autism spectrum, and males are 4 times more likely than girls to be diagnosed as such), as it turns out this movie is as much about autism as it is about culture, family, and spirituality. Rupert Isaacson, a writer and former horse trainer, and wife Kristin Neff, a psychology professor, are the parents of Rowan, whose lives took a drastic turn when after planning for a trip for ""Italy"", they ended up in ""Holland"" (see my review for ""Getting Your Kid on a Gluten-Free Casein-Free Diet"" by Susan Lord). In other words, they were thrown off balance because it is not only difficult to prepare for a child with autism, but the lack of readily available information via traditional sources such as physicians is scant to nonexistent, and when information is provided it takes time to sort through what is accurate and what is not, and what applies to one's child and what does not.While this film does get into some of the background behind Rowan's diagnosis, and shows the frequent tantrums common to autistic children, it does not discuss in any great detail the traditional care they sought in the medical community nor the alternative biomedical therapies they may have explored which are increasingly prevalent in this space due to the ill-equipped health care system to handle autism, a neurological disorder. While this might disappoint some viewers, the strengths of this movie are that it shows the relationship between father and son, depicts a family which is unified, and follows a family through Mongolia, a country little known to the West.Midway through the movie, in the midst of singing to his son, Rupert declares: ""Well, it's true - I'm a better father because of his autism. His autism forced me to listen to what interested him beyond all else and implemented because I had no choice. I'm glad now that I had no choice. It was tough at the time, but we're on to something good here"". He later comments that ""We would not be having this amazing, crazy, adventure across Mongolia if Rowan was not autistic. It seems like a curse in some ways, but in many ways it's a real blessing."" Despite some of the drawbacks of this documentary, and actions that Rupert and Kristin took with which one might disagree, it is difficult to fight such a positive attitude.The aspect of this film which will probably shy away some potential viewers is Rupert's pursuit of Mongolian shamen. Because the health care he and his wife pursued resulted in little progress for Rowan, Rupert sought other remedies. After speech delays, Rowan had said his first words while riding bareback on a horse, and after seeing the connection Rowan seemed to have with animals in general (Dr. Temple Grandin provides comments in the film that this is typical for individuals with autism, including herself), Rupert discovered that the one culture which integrates horses and healing is Mongolia. Whatever his initial reluctance may have been to seek such an avenue, Rupert decides to visit multiple shamen throughout the country who he later believes cured Rowan from autistic symptoms such as tantrums (not autism itself).Kristin, however, comments that ""To be honest, I don't really believe in spirits, you know, as actual entities - I think of them more as symbolic entities. My rational mind says, 'What does all this mean?'"" She later says ""I have no idea if any of it has an effect, or if it's just maybe calling up the focus and the intention for his healing which, in itself could be quite powerful. I don't know how useful it is to think of us as normal and totally healthy and Rowan as the ill one. I think it's way more complicated than that."" Along with Dr. Temple Grandin, several other experts weigh in during a 26-minute special features ""Additional Interviews with Autism Experts"" segment following the film, and one of these individuals would agree to some extent with this latter comment, commenting that most cultures around the world have traditionally found roles in society for those with autism, whereas Western culture has traditionally stigmatized those with autism. The great, hopeful development in recent years is that Western culture is now becoming more accepting of these individuals. Well recommended film.",4,"Planning for ""Italy"", ending up in ""Holland"", and journeying to Mongolia",1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,4349,"['was', 'originally', 'drawn', 'movie', 'focus', 'autistic', 'boy', 'son', 'one', '1', '91', 'who', 'are', 'autism', 'spectrum', 'males', 'are', '4', 'times', 'more', 'likely', 'girls', 'be', 'diagnosed', 'such', 'out', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'autism', 'culture', 'family', 'spirituality', 'Rupert', 'Isaacson', 'writer', 'former', 'horse', 'trainer', 'wife', 'Kristin', 'Neff', 'psychology', 'professor', 'are', 'parents', 'Rowan', 'lives', 'took', 'drastic', 'turn', 'when', 'planning', 'trip', 'Italy', 'ended', 'up', 'Holland', 'see', 'review', 'Getting', 'Kid', 'Gluten-Free', 'Casein-Free', 'Diet', 'Susan', 'Lord', 'other', 'words', 'were', 'thrown', 'off', 'balance', 'not', 'only', 'difficult', 'prepare', 'child', 'autism', 'lack', 'readily', 'available', 'information', 'traditional', 'sources', 'such', 'physicians', 'scant', 'nonexistent', 'when', 'information', 'provided', 'time', 'sort', 'what', 'accurate', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'child', 'what', 'not.While', 'film', 'get', 'background', 'Rowan', 'diagnosis', 'frequent', 'tantrums', 'common', 'autistic', 'children', 'not', 'discuss', 'great', 'detail', 'traditional', 'care', 'sought', 'medical', 'community', 'alternative', 'biomedical', 'therapies', 'may', 'have', 'explored', 'are', 'increasingly', 'prevalent', 'space', 'due', 'ill-equipped', 'health', 'care', 'system', 'handle', 'autism', 'neurological', 'disorder', 'might', 'disappoint', 'viewers', 'strengths', 'movie', 'are', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'family', 'unified', 'family', 'Mongolia', 'country', 'little', 'known', 'West.Midway', 'movie', 'midst', 'singing', 'son', 'Rupert', 'Well', 'true', ""'m"", 'better', 'father', 'autism', 'autism', 'forced', 'listen', 'what', 'interested', 'else', 'implemented', 'had', 'choice', ""'m"", 'glad', 'now', 'had', 'choice', 'was', 'tough', 'time', ""'re"", 'something', 'good', 'here', 'later', 'comments', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'having', 'amazing', 'crazy', 'adventure', 'Mongolia', 'Rowan', 'was', 'not', 'autistic', 'curse', 'ways', 'many', 'ways', 'real', 'blessing', 'drawbacks', 'documentary', 'actions', 'Rupert', 'Kristin', 'took', 'one', 'might', 'disagree', 'difficult', 'fight', 'positive', 'attitude.The', 'aspect', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'shy', 'away', 'potential', 'viewers', 'Rupert', 'pursuit', 'Mongolian', 'shamen', 'health', 'care', 'wife', 'pursued', 'resulted', 'little', 'progress', 'Rowan', 'Rupert', 'sought', 'other', 'remedies', 'speech', 'delays', 'Rowan', 'had', 'said', 'first', 'words', 'riding', 'bareback', 'horse', 'seeing', 'connection', 'Rowan', 'seemed', 'have', 'animals', 'general', 'Dr.', 'Temple', 'Grandin', 'comments', 'film', 'typical', 'individuals', 'autism', 'including', 'Rupert', 'discovered', 'one', 'culture', 'horses', 'healing', 'Mongolia', 'Whatever', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'seek', 'avenue', 'Rupert', 'visit', 'multiple', 'shamen', 'country', 'who', 'later', 'cured', 'Rowan', 'autistic', 'symptoms', 'such', 'tantrums', 'not', 'autism', '.Kristin', 'however', 'comments', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'spirits', 'know', 'actual', 'entities', 'think', 'more', 'symbolic', 'entities', 'rational', 'mind', ""'What"", 'mean', 'later', 'have', 'idea', 'effect', 'just', 'maybe', 'calling', 'up', 'focus', 'intention', 'healing', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'powerful', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'useful', 'think', 'normal', 'totally', 'healthy', 'Rowan', 'ill', 'one', 'think', 'way', 'more', 'complicated', 'Dr.', 'Temple', 'Grandin', 'several', 'other', 'experts', 'weigh', '26-minute', 'special', 'features', 'Additional', 'Interviews', 'Autism', 'Experts', 'segment', 'following', 'film', 'one', 'individuals', 'would', 'agree', 'extent', 'latter', 'comment', 'commenting', 'most', 'cultures', 'world', 'have', 'traditionally', 'found', 'roles', 'society', 'autism', 'whereas', 'Western', 'culture', 'traditionally', 'stigmatized', 'autism', 'great', 'hopeful', 'development', 'recent', 'years', 'Western', 'culture', 'now', 'becoming', 'more', 'accepting', 'individuals', 'Well', 'recommended', 'film']",N/A

I watched this documentary since it had a high rating and produced for PBS. It was very difficult for me not to walk away from this documentary at first few minutes. Very disturbing to watch a child scream and cry continuously while meantime two adults trying to talk, communicate and somehow reason with that child unsuccessfully. I enjoy every single moment of my life by insuring that I feed my body the best diet and spirits so I will be able to conquer my next mountain biking trail, or hiking trail, or pumping iron, or the next big wave in the ocean... I do not worry about health since I have health, worship my health, thankful for my health and enjoy my health. Being an avid documentary junkie, I always watch health related documentaries so I can get the best knowledge that I can for my body and mind. It is not like I have not watched any documentary about individuals that suffer from some kind of mental or physical disability or discomfort, it is that I had never watched a child who suffers from something unknown which society has chosen to call it Autism while two other individuals who are his parents have to be there every moment of their lives right next to that child.What they did, where they went, what they achieved are all in the documentary and everyone can walk away with their own take. As parents they deserve a Noble Peace Prize. Wish them health and happiness. The director of this documentary has truly done a superb work and his work should be recognized as well.

1281436,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B002ONC9W8,Samuel McKewon,"[18, 25]","Any magazine, newspaper or film daring to explore autism is ripe to start crossfire conversations; this documentary is hardly different as it follows the efforts of journalist Rupert Issacson and his psychologist/professor wife, Kristin Neff, to reach  their 5-year-old autistic son, Rowan, via a horseback journey through Mongolia. Issacson, a ethnographer who embraces alternative, ritualistic healing methods, calls upon Mongolian shamans - some of whom shepherd reindeer by day -to ""cure"" their son of, if not autism, then his debilitating tantrums and self-imposed incontinence on the toilet.Issacson secured a $1 million book deal to finance the film before even embarking on the trip, so the movie's uplifting end seems ordained - not the kind of ground a doc should hope to claim - although the journey through Mongolia, spare but beautiful, is captured eloquently through Scott's camera. The shamans, some of whom suggest otherworldly origins for Rowan's condition - Neff's poisoned womb, a manic-depressive grandmother holding on to the boy in her afterlife - mostly appear to be workmanlike and uninspired. Their methods - plying Rowan with fluids, lightly whipping the parents, asking Neff to wash herself while facing toward America - appear dubious, and the work of the main shaman is barely captured on camera inside a darkened tent. What he does, and how he does it, remains unclear. Then he lights a cigarette, and asks them to leave. Then he proclaims that, one day, Rowan will be a shaman.So, yes, ""The Horse Boy"" is that kind of film, subjectively objective, occasionally drifting from credulity before being filed as another document detailing the mystery of autism. Rowan, whose natural affinity for animals makes him a good candidate for the trip, is fairly delightful, if unpredictable. Issacson, the father, seems more interested in the larger implications of the journey - he speaks of the trip in terms of success or failure in ways beyond his son's health - while Neff, his wife, emerges as game-for-adventure, dutiful and pragmatic.

The actors look like real people, so I think it's supposed to be a documentary, but I am not sure that I saw that anywhere on the DVD cover (I am going from memory, but I recall that this was something I questioned after finishing watching it so I think I would have looked). The story is about parents of an autistic child going to Mongolia to treat their son's autism. It seems to me that these New Agey people would have tried things like chelation, diet changes, supplements and social butterflies before choosing medications, but if they did, they didn't show that. (I think that's an important omission). Anyway, so they decide to trek to Mongolia to engage in shamanic ritual to help their son. It seems really honest and heart felt. It made me question energy work and spirituality, but then I felt so incredibly let down to learn that the father got a million dollar advance to do this! Did that influence the outcome of the trip? I don't see how it could not.
