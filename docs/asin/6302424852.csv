I was so disappointed but put it aside to try it on my less ""up to the minute"" DVD player and TV.  I'm so glad I gave it s second chance because it was just lovely and as wonderful as I'd hoped it would be.  I'm thrilled to have this movie that I first saw as a teen and always adored!

Who cares about his study with Czerny or his religious faith in such a film anyway?Instead, we have quite a lot of romances with pretty faces,  elegant dresses and magnificent palaces. There was even a brief mention about Chopin and Wagner in the background. Visual effect was excellent and even the actor on the piano was so remarkable.I'm not too sure though if Boglet would suit the taste of all piano lovers, probably not: Liszt is Liszt, who can compare with him when even Anton Rubinstein wanted to be his pupil. But for the general audience, it's just marvelous. The sound is wonderful too, not just the music,the dialoges too.The plot was forceful and the rhythm fast and there is not a single scene that is boring. The result: one could easily sit still in front of it for the whole length of 130 minutes and for twice.Highly recommended.",5,A Perfect Time Killer,1051228800,"04 25, 2003",2003,1072,"['have', 'gone', 'film', 'twice', 'still', 'find', 'interesting.This', 'not', 'documentary', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'depth', 'insight', 'portrayal', 'Liszt', 'else', 'most', 'audience', 'might', 'be', 'bored', 'death', 'Who', 'study', 'Czerny', 'religious', 'faith', 'such', 'film', 'anyway', 'Instead', 'have', 'quite', 'lot', 'romances', 'pretty', 'elegant', 'dresses', 'magnificent', 'palaces', 'was', 'even', 'brief', 'mention', 'Chopin', 'Wagner', 'background', 'Visual', 'effect', 'was', 'excellent', 'even', 'actor', 'piano', 'was', 'so', 'remarkable.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'Boglet', 'would', 'suit', 'taste', 'piano', 'lovers', 'probably', 'not', 'Liszt', 'Liszt', 'who', 'can', 'compare', 'when', 'even', 'Anton', 'Rubinstein', 'wanted', 'be', 'pupil', 'general', 'audience', 'just', 'marvelous', 'sound', 'wonderful', 'too', 'not', 'just', 'music', 'dialoges', 'too.The', 'plot', 'was', 'forceful', 'rhythm', 'fast', 'not', 'single', 'scene', 'boring', 'result', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'sit', 'still', 'front', 'whole', 'length', '130', 'minutes', 'twice.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

I notice it is not being offered on DVD at present. But I did buy it on Video originally and when I saw I could get it on DVD; a while back I thought it might have improved in quality of sound.Alas; the DVD has the same faults as the Video so obviously no technical re recording was attempted.I am not very versed in the history of Lizst and his affairs and the ones with whom he had his affairs.I mainly was disappointed at some of the technical flaws in the Movie BOTH on Video and then again on DVD.While I realize the Movie was originally probably made on 35 mm for Cinema showing..I want other viewers to look at it again and see the number of places where the sound is quite poor.1. In One or two of the concerts  Lizst's playing is really beautiful. BUT when the audience applauds him it is like the applause is off some where in another room. Notice the variation in sound.2. When Lizst visits his Mother the first time notice when Lizst speaks the sound is perfect but when his mother speaks it is like she is off some place else.I found it to be the same on both Video and DVD so I have no doubt that no effort was made in transferring from Tape to DVD to enhance some of the troublesome spots where sound failed.I wish I was more up on the truth of the real Lizst as some other writers were but as far as the technical side of the Movie I was disappointed in several areas.,3,Transfer to Video and DVD quite imperfect,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,1461,"['was', 'really', 'impressed', 'reports', 'have', 'read', 'Song', 'Without', 'End', 'notice', 'not', 'being', 'offered', 'DVD', 'present', 'did', 'buy', 'Video', 'originally', 'when', 'saw', 'could', 'get', 'DVD', 'back', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'improved', 'quality', 'sound.Alas', 'DVD', 'same', 'faults', 'Video', 'so', 'obviously', 'technical', 're', 'recording', 'was', 'attempted.I', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'versed', 'history', 'Lizst', 'affairs', 'ones', 'whom', 'had', 'affairs.I', 'mainly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'technical', 'flaws', 'Movie', 'BOTH', 'Video', 'then', 'again', 'DVD.While', 'realize', 'Movie', 'was', 'originally', 'probably', 'made', '35', 'mm', 'Cinema', 'showing..I', 'want', 'other', 'viewers', 'look', 'again', 'see', 'number', 'places', 'where', 'sound', 'quite', 'poor.1', 'One', 'two', 'concerts', 'Lizst', 'playing', 'really', 'beautiful', 'BUT', 'when', 'audience', 'applause', 'where', 'room', 'Notice', 'variation', 'sound.2', 'When', 'Lizst', 'Mother', 'first', 'time', 'notice', 'when', 'Lizst', 'sound', 'perfect', 'when', 'mother', 'place', 'else.I', 'found', 'be', 'same', 'Video', 'DVD', 'so', 'have', 'doubt', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'transferring', 'Tape', 'DVD', 'enhance', 'troublesome', 'spots', 'where', 'sound', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'up', 'truth', 'real', 'Lizst', 'other', 'writers', 'were', 'as', 'far', 'technical', 'side', 'Movie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'several', 'areas']",N/A
