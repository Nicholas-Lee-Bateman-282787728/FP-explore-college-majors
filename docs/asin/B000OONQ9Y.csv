1064828,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000OONQ9Y,A. Gammill,"[79, 80]","Beauty & The Beast's second season had a rough start, owing to the writer's guild strike in the fall of 1988.  But out of adversity often come great things, and greatness is in abundance during this beloved series' sophomore year.I don't want to give away too many plot points, for those who haven't seen (or maybe have forgotten) the events of the series.  But to be fair to those who'd rather be surprised....MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD.  It's safe to say that the love between Catherine and Vincent grows stronger, even as they brave seemingly insurmountable obstacles to their relationship.  Returning guest stars from season one include Linda Hamilton's then-husband Bruce Abbott as Devin; Edward Albert as the ambitious yet tragic Elliot Burch; Terrylene as the deaf-mute Laura; and the wonderful Tony Jay as Vincent's chief nemesis, Paracelsus.  And the many returning Tunnel characters get a chance to shine in the impressive ""Dead of Winter,"" and in ""Labyrinths,"" in which we learn the reasons many of them now reside beneath the streets of New York City.I will begrudgingly acknowledge there were a couple of sub-standard episodes.  These include the somewhat Vincent-less ""Trial,"" in which Catherine prosecutes a man accused of killing his son; and the excessively violent ""The Hollow Men.""  But these are but two blemishes in an otherwise excellent season of television.On the plus side, the aforementioned ""Dead of Winter"" is only one of three episodes that with a Christmas theme.  ""Remember Love"" is the B & B version of ""It's a Wonderful Life""; ""God Bless the Child"" offers a message of hope, even as an unforeseen obstacle threatens Vincent & Catherine's relastionship.  And t.v. just doesn't get any better than the season closing trilogy, which elevate this gentle romantic fantasy to near-operatic proportions.  And in the best tradition of cliffhanging season-enders, leave you dying to know what comes next.This year marks the 20th anniversary of Beauty & The Beast.  I hope everyone who has enjoyed this unique show will continue to support its release on DVD.  We still have one more season--albeit a shortened and somewhat controvesial one--to go!",5,Even better than the first season!,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,2165,"['Beauty', 'Beast', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'rough', 'start', 'owing', 'writer', 'guild', 'strike', 'fall', '1988', 'adversity', 'often', 'great', 'things', 'greatness', 'abundance', 'beloved', 'series', 'sophomore', 'year.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'points', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'maybe', 'have', 'forgotten', 'events', 'series', 'be', 'fair', 'who', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'surprised', '.MINOR', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'safe', 'say', 'love', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'stronger', 'even', 'brave', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'obstacles', 'relationship', 'Returning', 'guest', 'stars', 'season', 'one', 'include', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'then-husband', 'Bruce', 'Abbott', 'Devin', 'Edward', 'Albert', 'ambitious', 'yet', 'tragic', 'Elliot', 'Burch', 'Terrylene', 'deaf-mute', 'Laura', 'wonderful', 'Tony', 'Jay', 'Vincent', 'chief', 'nemesis', 'Paracelsus', 'many', 'returning', 'Tunnel', 'characters', 'get', 'chance', 'shine', 'impressive', 'Dead', 'Winter', 'Labyrinths', 'learn', 'reasons', 'many', 'now', 'reside', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City.I', 'will', 'begrudgingly', 'acknowledge', 'were', 'couple', 'sub-standard', 'episodes', 'include', 'somewhat', 'Vincent-less', 'Trial', 'Catherine', 'man', 'accused', 'killing', 'son', 'excessively', 'violent', 'Hollow', 'Men', 'are', 'two', 'blemishes', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'season', 'television.On', 'plus', 'side', 'aforementioned', 'Dead', 'Winter', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'episodes', 'Christmas', 'theme', 'Remember', 'Love', 'B', 'B', 'version', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'God', 'Bless', 'Child', 'message', 'hope', 'even', 'unforeseen', 'obstacle', 'Vincent', 'Catherine', 'relastionship', 't.v', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'season', 'closing', 'trilogy', 'elevate', 'gentle', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'near-operatic', 'proportions', 'best', 'tradition', 'cliffhanging', 'season-enders', 'leave', 'dying', 'know', 'what', 'next.This', 'year', '20th', 'anniversary', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'hope', 'everyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'unique', 'show', 'will', 'continue', 'support', 'release', 'DVD', 'still', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'shortened', 'somewhat', 'controvesial', 'one', 'go']",Beauty and the Beast: Season 2

Back then she and I was very much in love. This series captured the essence of what true love really meant. We believed in our love the same way and communicated through our third eye much like Vincent & Catherine. The episode about Lover lost impacted us and I never will forget that episode. We were shocked and stunned. But the message of death having no dominion was clear a powerful. Unfortunately a few years later, I was placed in a position where I truly understood what it meant. My wife Shelia G. Wheeler went to glory and the words of this show never left me. The magic and spirituality of it all kept me strong. That was 1991. I was 32 at the time.

1064833,A38B6JNQA3USU7,B000OONQ9Y,Edward Waters,"[62, 63]","Although long rumoured to have had only women devotees, in fact BEAUTY AND THE BEAST remains to this day my own favourite American television serial as well.  It debuted in 1987, during perhaps the most EXTERNALLY oppressive period in my wife's and my entire marriage.  Feeling alienated from so much around us, we drew deeper into our already close relationship and spent countless hours together reading aloud, listening to good music, and drinking MANY pots of tea.  So this programme about a couple estranged from the 'normal' world -- whose love, nigh-mystical understanding of one another, and taste for simple joys were so like our own -- was deeply encouraging.  Then too, its many literary allusions actually advanced our own interest in classic literature.  I credit the scripts with our appreciation of everything from Shakespeare's 29th sonnet to Rilke's LETTERS TO A YOUNG POET to THE VELVETEEN RABBIT.Of course, the show was not flawless.  Its earliest episodes suffered from excessive Beast-to-the-rescue plotlines; and after Linda Hamilton's departure, the truncated third and final season was seriously marred by a misguided decision to escalate action and violence, presumably in hope of better ratings.  The serial's middle run was by far its best, focusing on Vincent and Catherine's deeply-romantic yet functionally-platonic relationship, the intriguing history of the tunnel community, and the mysterious wonders and perils of the vast realms even further Below.  Yet, whatever its strengths and weaknesses, that the programme came to be at all was a blessing beyond hope in a medium so often glutted with mere ugliness and inanity.

Well, the studio listened to the fans. This release has recently taped special introductions to certain episodes by both Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton. It is neat seeing them together again, some 17 years after the series ended. The first introduction begins at the front before season two begins with ""Chamber Music."" As to the video quality on this DVD set, I looked at two episodes last night, ""Dead of Winter"" and ""God Bless the Child,"" and they were, in my opinion, both of higher quality than the episodes in the season one set. I viewed ""The Watcher"" tonight and it looked fantastic. They cleaned up season two better than season one. I should note that there is also a video introduction by Perlman and Hamilton before the last season two episode, ""The Rest is Silence.""

1064835,AIVY7XC1HRIN7,B000OONQ9Y,Jan R. Schulman,"[8, 8]","Although I despaired at how the third season ended (so cruel), I truly loved the first and second (especially the second) seasons of this incredibly gorgeous series.  It amazes me that with the type of junk that is on TV today, something like this was ever made. (I cannot tell you how many times I have re-read Shakespeare's Sonnets since this series was on...Shakespeare did indeed ""know everything."") Not only is the romance between the two leading characters incredibly moving and uplifting, all of the characters are of amazing interest, original and compelling.  Of course the ""underground"" community is the most interesting, but with Katherine as the conduit between the two worlds, it causes one to hold one's breath throughout each episode, regardless of where the action is taking place.  The setting of the underground world is beyond belief --- beautiful and frightening and literally fantastic.  The love between Father and Vincent is so amazingly touching.  I would love it if one special TV movie with the full cast could be made --- not that anything could add to the story, but perhaps one special incredibly intelligent writer could come up with something so that once again we could see Vincent, Katherine, Father, and everyone.  I know it's not possible; wouldn't make any sense given the way it played out, but still...  But I am so happy that these DVD's are finally available.  I've been aching for them.  Thank you, whoever made this decision, for making it available once again to the world.  Maybe, in addition to we fans who loved it so the first time around, it will also find a new audience who loves it as much as we do.  That will be a real gift.  I just hope the word gets out about these DVD's so that people know they can now buy them and watch them once again.

Words are beyond insufficient in describing this series for those who remain mournfully ignorant, but if it will intrigue new viewers, it is definitely worth the effort.In short, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is Poetry in sight, sound and emotion. This is the one series that will forever be known as the impossibly beautiful, heart-wrenching, and all-consuming dream that changed everyone who understood its message. I truly pity those who refused to do so, even if it was in part due to them that such a brilliant masterpiece was cancelled so quickly.Now to the topic at hand: Season Two, the most beloved of many a fan. Personally, I disagree. Every single episode captured my imagination and left me aching for more, even in the most violent and tragic moments. I simply love them all, so much so that I own a boot-leg ""all season"" set (rest assured that I have bought the official versions and will continue to do so). However, I will admit to having something very close to a ""favorite,"" and it happens to reside in this season, so... take from that what you will.""Brothers,"" in my opinion, encapsulates the very spirit of a very difficult to define series, and it has dear Charles. When he and Vincent talk about the misleading effects of appearances, giving Charles the courage to remove his bag-like mask... I literally wept from sheer joy. While it is true that the man will never be an Adonis by ""normal"" standards because of the disfigurement from his disease, he could power an entire hemisphere indefinitely with that smile. Seeing him come to terms with his differences, with the support of his newfound friends, and gain the courage to face the World Above for the sake of his eternally restless ""brother"" Devon left me deeply moved. Such is the incandescence of all Vincent, Catherine, and their world have been trying to share with us for the last two decades. I can only pray that more will listen in time.Like the rest of the hopelessly addicted followers, I eagerly await this release, when I might add the in-store version to my Amazon pre-order as I have with Season One.

Meanwhile, they're still trying to save the people around them from immpossible situations while being there for each other.I like that the fact that in this season (so far) there are no neat and tidy endings and sometimes love cannot truly conquer all (example being the first episode, ""Chamber Music."") In all aspects of this, Catherine and Vincent's strong love for each other still shines and actually makes them stronger as a couple. They come to realize that sometimes you can't really help someone, but you can let them know you're there. That, in itself, is more than needed.The cinematography is terrific and the dialogue, while poetic and lyrical, fills the story with flavor and provides art through the tough stories.

1064849,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000OONQ9Y,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[2, 2]","Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman return in the second season of the fantasy series Beauty and the Beast. Season Two features grittier storylines that probe the worst that humanity has to offer, including street gangs, drug addicts, gruesome murders, and the sick revenge of a twisted mind that threatens to shatter Vincent's sanity. There were several episodes that I really enjoyed, such as ""God Bless the Child,"" where a frightened teenage prostitute seeks sanctuary for her unborn child and falls in love with Vincent, ""A Fair and Perfect Knight,"" where Michael, a very bright young tunnel dweller, falls in love with Catherine before starting college Above, ""Brothers,"" featuring the return of Vincent's brother Devin, a master at reinventing himself, and ""Remember Love,"" a Capra-esque look at what life would have been like if Vincent hadn't met Catherine. Several characters from the first season return, including Mouse, Laura, Elliott Burch, and Paracelsus.The main story arc of season two revolves around outcast mad genius John Pater, aka Paracelsus (Tony Jay). After being expelled from the tunnels and nearly killed in a fire in the last season, Paracelsus plots his ghastly revenge against Father and Vincent, first in the episode ""Dead of Winter"" and in the final season-end trilogy ""What Rough Beast,"" ""Ceremony of Innocense,"" and ""The Rest is Silence."" The dark, gory storyline in the final three episodes sets up a cliffhanger for the final season, which in turn was even darker and more violent than the second. I really disliked the direction that the show was taking at the end of season two; this subject had already been covered in season one's ""The Alchemist"" and I would have preferred to see a stronger focus on Catherine and Vincent's relationship. The writers essentially ruined their special relationship by placing Vincent in increasingly more violent situations that shred the delicate balance between man and beast.But there are several bright spots: the writing feels more consistent, there is more physical contact and less awkwardness between Catherine and Vincent, and there are several good episodes here, such as ""When the Bluebird Sings,"" which stars the (possible) ghost of a playful painter, and ""A Distant Shore,"" in which Vincent is largely absent, but there is some gorgeous dream scenery of Catherine and Vincent walking together in the rolling surf. Ron Perlman emotes extraordinarily well even under Rick Baker's superb makeup and bulky clothes; in the later episodes, his eyes capture the madness and torture inside of Vincent. Set design is gorgeous as usual, calling to mind Brian Froud's work onThe Dark Crystal (25th Anniversary Edition). Extras are scarce, but there are several new introductions by Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman on select episodes. The packaging is great: it's easy to access each DVD, and they're separated so they don't get scratched.  This is a wise investment for fans of season one, but if you're new to the series, start withBeauty and the Beast - The Complete First Season. If you're a diehard fan, you're probably better off buyingBeauty and the Beast - The Complete Series. As for myself, I was so disappointed in the direction that the series was going that I didn't bother watching the final season, which saw the departure of most of the original cast.",4,A darker season heralds a plunge into madness,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,3334,"['Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'return', 'second', 'season', 'fantasy', 'series', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Season', 'Two', 'features', 'grittier', 'storylines', 'probe', 'worst', 'humanity', 'offer', 'including', 'street', 'gangs', 'drug', 'addicts', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'sick', 'revenge', 'twisted', 'mind', 'shatter', 'Vincent', 'sanity', 'were', 'several', 'episodes', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'such', 'God', 'Bless', 'Child', 'where', 'frightened', 'teenage', 'prostitute', 'sanctuary', 'unborn', 'child', 'love', 'Vincent', 'Fair', 'Perfect', 'Knight', 'where', 'Michael', 'very', 'bright', 'young', 'tunnel', 'dweller', 'love', 'Catherine', 'starting', 'college', 'Above', 'Brothers', 'featuring', 'return', 'Vincent', 'brother', 'Devin', 'master', 'reinventing', 'Remember', 'Love', 'Capra-esque', 'look', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Vincent', 'had', ""n't"", 'met', 'Catherine', 'Several', 'characters', 'first', 'season', 'return', 'including', 'Mouse', 'Laura', 'Elliott', 'Burch', 'Paracelsus.The', 'main', 'story', 'arc', 'season', 'two', 'revolves', 'outcast', 'mad', 'genius', 'John', 'Pater', 'aka', 'Paracelsus', 'Tony', 'Jay', 'being', 'expelled', 'tunnels', 'nearly', 'killed', 'fire', 'last', 'season', 'Paracelsus', 'ghastly', 'revenge', 'Father', 'Vincent', 'first', 'episode', 'Dead', 'Winter', 'final', 'season-end', 'trilogy', 'What', 'Rough', 'Beast', 'Ceremony', 'Innocense', 'Rest', 'Silence', 'dark', 'gory', 'storyline', 'final', 'three', 'episodes', 'up', 'cliffhanger', 'final', 'season', 'turn', 'was', 'even', 'darker', 'more', 'violent', 'second', 'really', 'disliked', 'direction', 'show', 'was', 'taking', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'subject', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'covered', 'season', 'one', 'Alchemist', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'stronger', 'focus', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'relationship', 'writers', 'essentially', 'ruined', 'special', 'relationship', 'placing', 'Vincent', 'increasingly', 'more', 'violent', 'situations', 'shred', 'delicate', 'balance', 'man', 'beast.But', 'are', 'several', 'bright', 'spots', 'writing', 'feels', 'more', 'consistent', 'more', 'physical', 'contact', 'less', 'awkwardness', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'are', 'several', 'good', 'episodes', 'here', 'such', 'When', 'Bluebird', 'Sings', 'possible', 'ghost', 'playful', 'painter', 'A', 'Distant', 'Shore', 'Vincent', 'largely', 'absent', 'gorgeous', 'dream', 'scenery', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'walking', 'together', 'rolling', 'surf', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'even', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'superb', 'makeup', 'bulky', 'clothes', 'later', 'episodes', 'eyes', 'capture', 'madness', 'torture', 'Vincent', 'Set', 'design', 'gorgeous', 'usual', 'calling', 'mind', 'Brian', 'Froud', 'work', 'onThe', 'Dark', 'Crystal', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Extras', 'are', 'scarce', 'are', 'several', 'new', 'introductions', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'select', 'episodes', 'packaging', 'great', 'easy', 'access', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'separated', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'scratched', 'wise', 'investment', 'fans', 'season', 'one', ""'re"", 'new', 'series', 'start', 'withBeauty', 'Beast', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'fan', ""'re"", 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'buyingBeauty', 'Beast', 'Complete', 'Series', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'direction', 'series', 'was', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'final', 'season', 'saw', 'departure', 'most', 'original', 'cast']",Beauty and the Beast: Season 2
