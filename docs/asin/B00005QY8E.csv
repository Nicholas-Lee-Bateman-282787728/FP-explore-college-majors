Like Lain, one of my top fav shows!  I've seen Lain about 7 times and now think I understand at least most.  I have to start watching boogiepop again as well now.

676376,AE5A9FB765HMF,B00005QY8E,gex144,"[1, 1]","[Review refers to the thinpak collection, which also contains the Boogiepop & Others prequel movie]I first watched this series when G4 was known as G4 Tech Tv, and had an anime section, and wasn't lame. The show seemed pretty cool, even though I didn't understand everything.I watch the whole series again a 2nd time through a couple years later. Pretty much had the same reaction, except that I understood it a little more.Recently, I decided to give the Boogiepop Phantom DVD Thinpak Collection (2000) a purchase. I chose that version of the DVD collection for 2 reasons. 1, it has a live action movie that is a prequel to the series, so I figured it would fill me in on details that are tough or impossible to catch in the anime. 2, English commentary on the episodes.But then I decided to go a step further. I purchased 2 of the light novels. Boogiepop and Others (the first light novel written I believe, and is the novel that the movie is based on [obviously, since it has the same title]), and Boogiepop at Dawn. I read both of those novels first before re-watching the series (starting with Boogiepop and Others), and I have to say, both of them are mandatory. They give you background on so much stuff in the anime. In fact, while watching the series again, I realized that the anime kind of assumes the viewer has already read these novels. They're worth a read, and they won't take long to finish. They are &#34;light&#34; novels after all.So after all that, I first tried to watch the live action adaptation of Boogiepop and Others. In a nutshell, it's bad. I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing after seeing how much they butcher the novel (okay, they didn't exactly butcher it, but they could've done a hell of a lot better, even with the low budget).There were only 2 things I liked about what I managed to watch from the movie. 1, the Warning label that comes up at the beginning of every movie, that says you will be sued up the @$$ and imprisoned if you make copies of the video and put it online. What they do with this is so freaking brilliant and hilarious, I wonder why no slasher movies have done the same thing. They have the warning copyright notice as usual, but instead of a blank background screen, they show 3 dead students in the background. It took me a moment to consider the implications of this [don't make bootlegs, or this will be your fate], and once that moment passed, I was laughing for 5 minutes straight . Anyway, the 2nd thing I liked was the Manticore (or just a regular schoolgirl since they couldn't afford make-up effects, not that they would need much for this) at the beginning of the film. She is sitting over a dead(?) girl, and licks her eyeball while her eyelids are open. Since this movie is low budget to the point of being unable to afford decent makeup effects or costumes (the Boogiepop outfit is a joke; seriously, it made me laugh), I'm pretty sure this wasn't a prop. These were two real actresses in the scene, one of them having nerves of steel to keep her eye open, and the other not managing to gag while licking her eyeball. That sequence is gag-worthy, unsettling, a little creepy, and great. Props to the one who got her eye licked. I don't know how she was able to keep her eye open and not flinch during that whole sequence, but she did it.And that's it, those are the only 2 reasons to watch the first 10-15 minutes of the live action film. It gets too boring to bear watching the rest, so I fast-forwarded to the finale sequence, and it's just as irritating as the rest of the film, seeing what they changed. They didn't exactly change anything that affects the plot in a major way, but if you see it after reading the light novel, you will be asking &#34;Why?&#34; the whole time you're watching the movie.As for the anime, it got a whole lot better having knowledge gained from the 2 light novels. This show doesn't hold your hand. It expects the viewers to be of decent intelligence, and expects their full attention and focus while watching each episode, like Serial Experiments Lain except that this show rewards your dedication and gets better with each viewing.The first two episodes let you know exactly what you're getting into, and will immediately let you know if this is the show for you, or not. The strange blurred style, the unique music, the mystery, the fact that you will come to know other characters that you only catch a glimpse of in previous episodes, and the supernatural things that happen. I would recommend watching the first 2 episodes, and if it seems interesting to you at all in anyway, and you want to watch the rest of the series, read the 2 light novels first, then watch the series. Trust me, you will be glad you did. That said, so long as you really pay attention, you can enjoy the series for what it is without reading the novels.People have compared this show to Lain. I'll admit, the comparisons aren't without warrant. Both are weird in their own way, and both demand your attention and thinking caps. But I would also compare this show to The Wire. I only make that comparison with the knowledge gained from the 2 novels. Here's why. By the end of the series, in the final moments of the final episode, it gets pretty emotional. Why? Because it's like the last page of a big novel has just been turned, and it's over. It's the end of it all. It's bittersweet, not everyone gets what they wanted, some turn out better than others. But in the end, it's goodbye. It's the end of an important time in the lives of the characters we come to know from the novels and at points in the anime. They all know this is the end of their youth, and they have to say goodbye to each other, and to the lives they had. It's a feeling you can only get if you've come to know the characters through the novels, which increases the emotional impact of the final moments of the last episode by ten-fold. Let me put it this way, without reading the novels, it's like watching Kingdom of Heaven. With the novels, it's Kingdom of Heaven The Director's Cut.Oh yeah, and the commentary. Man, these English guys who worked on getting this anime stateside, we couldn't have gotten it from a better group. These guys are passionate about this anime. Just listening to the commentary on some of the episodes, seeing their notes on the Bonus Feature on the final dvd disc. Whichever version of the anime set you get, make sure it has the English Producers commentary on it. The only thing that would make the set any more perfect is if it came with the 2 light novels (especially if they replace the live-action movie).I recommend this series, big time.",5,How to properly

The world is not ready for them. The magical light also allows dangerous creatures into the world who collide and hide in people. That's about it. The story(ies) arc tries hard to be mysterious by purposefully obscuring details. It doesn't feel mysterious. It feels unorganized. The tale comes together slowly, in a disappointing, anti-climatic manner. When crucial plot points were revealed, I'd already figured out the puzzle, and I'm not one to figure things out ahead of time unless they're pretty obvious. The final disc is pointless and adds nothing to the story. It's just drawn out closure on top of more drawn out closure.

676382,A3LDRRC6MYEGJP,B00005QY8E,Robert Parker,"[8, 9]","It took me at least three viewings of this whole series, one of which was with the director's commentary, to fully appreciate the skill with which this series is woven. It is completely non-linear, told (but for the final episode) entirely in flashback. The narrative forces you to assemble the puzzle that is the Boogiepop world one seemingly random piece at a time, but once that's done, you will discover an unbelievable picture. The various narrative threads create an incredible tapestry, and it's all the more amazing considering that you are only shown the threads one at a time, completely out of chronological order.This series requires an investment of time and dedicated viewing, and it's not for the hard of thinking. If your experience with anime is Yugi-oh and Sailor Moon...well, you're in for a surprise. A very big, possibly wet and squishy, and certainly very unnerving, surprise.

676384,A171IP3X2DICV2,B00005QY8E,the evil artist,"[3, 3]",Boogiepop Phantom is an awesome excursion into the stuff that is mystery and the macabre. After a strange light appears in the center of a city somewhere in japan a serial killer only known as the manticore escapes from the labs in which it was created and various people start gaining rather strange abilities. However the strangest thing about it is the seemingly random appearances of the entities known as boogiepop and poompoom. A truly eerie foray into the dark recesses of mans world and crosses the line into the depths of darkness itself. I liked the dark twist for a change of pace.The storyline gets confusing only if you don't pay attention to the details and it is rather hard to see but it in my opinion allows for even more eerieness when your mind tries to compensate for what is really going on and plays off the all too common fear not of the darkness itself but what lurks in it.,5,a true excursion into darkness,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,898,"['Boogiepop', 'Phantom', 'awesome', 'excursion', 'stuff', 'mystery', 'macabre', 'strange', 'light', 'center', 'city', 'somewhere', 'japan', 'serial', 'killer', 'only', 'known', 'manticore', 'labs', 'was', 'created', 'various', 'people', 'start', 'gaining', 'rather', 'strange', 'abilities', 'However', 'strangest', 'thing', 'seemingly', 'random', 'appearances', 'entities', 'known', 'boogiepop', 'poompoom', 'truly', 'eerie', 'foray', 'dark', 'recesses', 'mans', 'world', 'line', 'depths', 'darkness', 'liked', 'dark', 'twist', 'change', 'pace.The', 'storyline', 'confusing', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'details', 'rather', 'hard', 'see', 'opinion', 'even', 'more', 'eerieness', 'when', 'mind', 'tries', 'compensate', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'plays', 'too', 'common', 'fear', 'not', 'darkness', 'what']",N/A

We build legends in the mist and pretend that they don't exist, and that death doesn't come on swift wings for those that it wishes. Still, this reaction to the physical, this denial that something may indeed be looming and preying on the human wombs birthing thoughts without suspect, is sometimes wrong. It has only been a few nights since the bright light shined through the sky and people began acting differently, that the serial killer began stalking the depths of the city, and that ""the angel of death"" began taking away the children. They, special in their own rights, seem to call out to it and it comes, sending shockwaves through the minds of those that find the life they once believed in was nothing but a dream.BoogiePop Phantom is a series that I found highly addictive, with its ups and downs tempered by the fact that it was atmospherically charged by the transitions taking place and that the characters in it were fleshed out so well. Each episode focuses on the life of one person as the events begin transpiring, and the people they run across and the things that they cause, no matter how mundane the interaction is or how horrible, can sometimes be an intricate portion of someone else's tale. Sometimes this leads to oddities with a sea of strange scenes, distorting pieces that seem confusing at first until you see them later and then understand exactly what went on in that certain someone's life. Then again, it sometimes does quite the opposite, making it all the more strange. The pulse of the show is enigmatic because of the way its told and the way the music is incorporated into it, with fragmentations of completion being fed to the watcher slowly and the mood being set like a tablepiece to accent the motions. Within it there are depths of shocking darkness, mysterious revelation, and sadness mingling beneath an electric sky, digging deeper and deeper into everything until its finally revealed exactly who the manitcore and BoogiePop are and why the world has become so perplexed. By then, however, the picture painted will have sent ripples through a microcosm of society that will be changed forever.For anyone who enjoys a series that meticulously feeds you little pieces of a broadening horizon, letting you see things that accent the way people think and feel, then this would be a work for you. It is a darkened sky, though, complete with the fleeting images of demise and dying dreams, but that only adds to the aspects of what is taking place herein. Be warned that it does have moments in its pace that seem pointless in one episode to another and that sometimes frightens newer seekers, but this is because the series is actually one picture being painted on twelve individual canvases. Watch them all and ingest them in order, knowing that the concept will be a shadowy affair, and you'll find yourself addicted.",5,The Echoes of A Silent City,1048464000,"03 24, 2003",2003,2978,"['Sometimes', 'reality', 'draw', 'lines', 'sands', 'thought', 'imagine', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'intact', 'build', 'legends', 'mist', 'pretend', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'death', ""n't"", 'come', 'swift', 'wings', 'Still', 'reaction', 'physical', 'denial', 'something', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'looming', 'preying', 'human', 'wombs', 'birthing', 'thoughts', 'suspect', 'sometimes', 'wrong', 'only', 'been', 'few', 'nights', 'bright', 'light', 'shined', 'sky', 'people', 'began', 'acting', 'differently', 'serial', 'killer', 'began', 'stalking', 'depths', 'city', 'angel', 'death', 'began', 'taking', 'away', 'children', 'special', 'own', 'rights', 'seem', 'call', 'out', 'sending', 'shockwaves', 'minds', 'find', 'life', 'once', 'believed', 'was', 'nothing', 'dream.BoogiePop', 'Phantom', 'series', 'found', 'highly', 'addictive', 'ups', 'downs', 'tempered', 'fact', 'was', 'atmospherically', 'charged', 'transitions', 'taking', 'place', 'characters', 'were', 'fleshed', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'episode', 'life', 'one', 'person', 'events', 'begin', 'transpiring', 'people', 'run', 'things', 'cause', 'matter', 'how', 'interaction', 'how', 'horrible', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'intricate', 'portion', 'someone', 'else', 'tale', 'Sometimes', 'oddities', 'sea', 'strange', 'scenes', 'distorting', 'pieces', 'seem', 'confusing', 'first', 'see', 'later', 'then', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'went', 'certain', 'someone', 'life', 'Then', 'again', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'opposite', 'making', 'more', 'strange', 'pulse', 'show', 'enigmatic', 'way', 'told', 'way', 'music', 'incorporated', 'fragmentations', 'completion', 'being', 'fed', 'watcher', 'slowly', 'mood', 'being', 'set', 'tablepiece', 'accent', 'motions', 'are', 'depths', 'shocking', 'darkness', 'mysterious', 'revelation', 'sadness', 'mingling', 'electric', 'sky', 'digging', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'everything', 'finally', 'revealed', 'exactly', 'who', 'manitcore', 'BoogiePop', 'are', 'why', 'world', 'become', 'so', 'perplexed', 'then', 'however', 'picture', 'painted', 'will', 'have', 'sent', 'ripples', 'microcosm', 'society', 'will', 'be', 'changed', 'forever.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'series', 'meticulously', 'little', 'pieces', 'broadening', 'horizon', 'letting', 'see', 'things', 'accent', 'way', 'people', 'think', 'feel', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'work', 'darkened', 'sky', 'complete', 'fleeting', 'images', 'demise', 'dying', 'dreams', 'only', 'aspects', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'herein', 'Be', 'warned', 'have', 'moments', 'pace', 'seem', 'pointless', 'one', 'episode', 'sometimes', 'newer', 'seekers', 'series', 'actually', 'one', 'picture', 'being', 'painted', 'twelve', 'individual', 'canvases', 'Watch', 'ingest', 'order', 'knowing', 'concept', 'will', 'be', 'shadowy', 'affair', ""'ll"", 'find', 'addicted']",N/A
676386,A38JKOT65RLZ9Q,B00005QY8E,Wayne Rossi,"[6, 6]","Boogiepop Phantom is an anime that begins as a series of short story-style tales.  Filmed with sepia filters for 11 of the 12 episodes, it creates a world that is dark and haunting throughout.  What makes Boogiepop Phantom so incredible to watch, though, is the way its story is slowly unfolded across the tableau of episodes.  You get the first hints of this when the second episode utilizes a scene from the first - and it only becomes more haunting when you realize what it implies.The individual episodes are wrapped around a handful of incredible events.  The way the show lets time flow around each episode is magnificent, and its impact as you slowly realize some of what is going on is always stunning.  Every time you watch Boogiepop Phantom, you will understand more of its subtleties - don't get me wrong, it is *very* interesting on first viewing, but it's absolutely amazing to see an anime that you want to keep watching again and again to pick up on more small, but well-rendered, threads of its plot.  The characters are all intriguing, and each episode usually provides a very penetrating analysis of at least one of the show's figures.  The way it constructs its story (which has some horrifying moments that make what gore there is on-screen completely necessary - it actually strikes just the right note with each bit of weirdness) is marvelous.It's kinda on the short side, but if you're of the right mindset to enjoy it, you will not regret picking up Boogiepop Phantom.  You'll probably get a lot of great viewings out of it.  It's a lot of fun to watch with others and compare theories; even more fun is showing people the series for the first time and watch them go through this fascinating mental maze.
