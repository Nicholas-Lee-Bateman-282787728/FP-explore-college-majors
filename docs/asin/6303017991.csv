What better person to sing them in the third movie version than Gordon MacRae with his magnificently rich baritone/tenor voice.  He is joined by Kathryn Grayson, who sings with him on a couple of songs as well as by herself.  The movie story is exciting and also includes some humorous sequences.  For those who like comparing musical performances, Gordon MacRae also performed music from ""The Desert Song"" with both Dorothy Kirsten and Lucille Norman, both from The Metropolitan Opera, for vinyl record releases.  I personally feel that his partnering with Dorothy Kirsten is the superior version, but for those not familiar with Romberg operettas, Warner Brothers' ""The Desert Song"" is an excellent starting point.

The opening scenes with the obvious rear-screen projection, matte paintings, and intercut desert footage are laughable from a directorial point of view.  The plot is stereotypical, but perfect, with unctuous baddies, a mustachioed rival, and uppity leading lady.  As soon as Gordon and Kathryn begin to sing, however, we are transfixed, and all of the cinematic hoo-ha dissolves in the schmaltz of Sigmund Romberg.  In short, it's delicious, and you succumb to it because the songs are so wonderful.  And with Ray Collins as the wise general who helps sort out Arabia, what more could you ask?
