916540,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B0009Y260E,Boggman!,"[4, 4]","""Strings"" is quite a unique and intersting movie going experience. This just happens to be one of those movies I had never heard of before that I ran across doing research, and decided to give it a shot. My biggest problem with ""Strings"" is that the puppets do not move their mouths, which made it a little hard to follow the dialogue as it switched back and forth between characters. Once your able to get past that - this is really a beautiful little film.A little over-dramatic but with some pretty high production values, ""Strings"" is unlike no movie you have seen before.The cinematography, voice overs, and set designs are well done and very pleasing to watch and to listen to all throughout.One thing I enjoyed about ""Strings"" was the how the actual strings were incorporated in the movie. There is no effort to hide them. In fact, the strings themselves are part of each characters actual being, reaching all the way up in to the sky with the ""head"" string being the strongest and most valuable. Cut the head string, and your dead! Get a little to playful, and you might get tangled and need some help getting undone! Interesting little concept.Strings is a fantasy story about a King who commits suicide, leaving the throne to his son. When his son is lead to believe by his evil uncle that some outside rebels are responsible for his death, he seeks out to find them and avenge his father. In the process he goes on a magical journey, learning about life, love, war, and the fact that people and things aren't always quite what they seem.""Strings"" is a film that stands on its own two feet- apart from anything else out there. All in all, it's a very impressive piece of work- and a good family oriented film.Recommended!",4,Strings you along nicely......,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,1731,"['Strings', 'quite', 'unique', 'intersting', 'movie', 'going', 'experience', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'movies', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'ran', 'doing', 'research', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Strings', 'puppets', 'do', 'not', 'move', 'mouths', 'made', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'dialogue', 'switched', 'back', 'forth', 'characters', 'Once', 'able', 'get', 'really', 'beautiful', 'little', 'film.A', 'little', 'over-dramatic', 'pretty', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'Strings', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'before.The', 'cinematography', 'voice', 'overs', 'set', 'designs', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'pleasing', 'watch', 'listen', 'throughout.One', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'Strings', 'was', 'how', 'actual', 'strings', 'were', 'incorporated', 'movie', 'effort', 'hide', 'fact', 'strings', 'are', 'part', 'characters', 'actual', 'being', 'reaching', 'way', 'up', 'sky', 'head', 'string', 'being', 'strongest', 'most', 'valuable', 'Cut', 'head', 'string', 'dead', 'Get', 'little', 'playful', 'might', 'get', 'tangled', 'need', 'help', 'getting', 'undone', 'Interesting', 'little', 'concept.Strings', 'fantasy', 'story', 'King', 'who', 'suicide', 'leaving', 'throne', 'son', 'When', 'son', 'lead', 'believe', 'evil', 'uncle', 'outside', 'rebels', 'are', 'responsible', 'death', 'out', 'find', 'avenge', 'father', 'process', 'magical', 'journey', 'learning', 'life', 'love', 'war', 'fact', 'people', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'quite', 'what', 'seem', 'Strings', 'film', 'own', 'two', 'feet-', 'apart', 'anything', 'else', 'there', 'very', 'impressive', 'piece', 'work-', 'good', 'family', 'oriented', 'film.Recommended']",Strings

However it is not the what, but how is this treatment ""dressed"", which deserves some considering:1)A great opportunity for puppets to demonstrate their capacity to give quite satisfactory dramatic entertainment, over the usual slapstick light humor (even if they are both equally valid resources)in cinema. All this, being just what they are: wooden marionettes, not animatronics or computer animations.2)The skillful manipulation of marionettes (combined with a great hability from the director, photographers and editor)  to keep an agile rithm and pace throughout the story (something  otherwise quite difficult to achieve in action scenes due to the limitations of using long string puppets).2)Symbolism between the strings holding different parts of each ""marionette-character"" and the relevance of the ""head string"". Where do the strings come from? Who is the puppet and who is the puppeteer?, every question equally valid to our ""real"" life, including the heading title ""Tied by hate... Bound by love"".3)The outstanding labour of Mr. Joakim Zacho Weylandt in capturing every character's essence through different kinds of wood (an experience worth to see!).So far, so good...then, you may ask yourself:  -""why the three stars?""-.DISLIKES:The DVD was an opportunity to complete what the movie ""may"" have lost for lack of time near the deadline. Nevertheless this was not the case. Wellspring Media Inc. or Genius Entertainment failed their opportunity to offer a good quality product in:1) Filling the DVD with other trailers of their releases not even close to the genere or concept treated in Strings.2) Problems in their transfer (at least in the copy I purchased) in the scene where Hal's sister (Jhinna I guess), is about to be killed. In a close up to Jhinna's face, the shot seems to be zoomed in and out for very few frames making it feel like a jump in the image (unless it is a shot resource unknown to me up to now).3) Their ""Behind the Scenes"" feature is really disappointing. No presentation (no credits), no interviews, everything with direct cut, even the end, which, by the way is abrupt and seems like Wellspring Media told the DVD responsibles ""-Sorry! there is no more time, we have to get the DVD complete by tomorrow, leave the way it is-"".Come on people! we are the costumers, and we also deserve good products you know!WOULD LIKE:A more in deep behind the scenes fetturete, interviews with the cast and the master puppetbuilder.CONCLUSION:A great movie to see, a better DVD should be done.",3,"Up for the movie, down for the DVD",1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,2909,"['will', 'find', 'everything', 'could', 'wish', 'movie', 'plot', 'net', 'am', 'keeping', 'review', 'general', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'found', 'DVD', 'would', 'like', 'case', 'collectors', 'special', 'edition', 'considered', 'near', 'future', 'LIKES', 'Certainly', 'general', 'treatment', 'Strings', 'not', 'novelity', 'average', 'cinema', 'aficionados', 'Good', 'bad', 'However', 'not', 'what', 'how', 'treatment', 'dressed', 'considering:1', 'A', 'great', 'opportunity', 'puppets', 'demonstrate', 'capacity', 'give', 'quite', 'satisfactory', 'dramatic', 'entertainment', 'usual', 'slapstick', 'light', 'humor', 'even', 'are', 'equally', 'valid', 'resources', 'cinema', 'being', 'just', 'what', 'are', 'wooden', 'marionettes', 'not', 'animatronics', 'computer', 'animations.2', 'skillful', 'manipulation', 'marionettes', 'combined', 'great', 'hability', 'director', 'photographers', 'editor', 'keep', 'agile', 'rithm', 'pace', 'story', 'something', 'otherwise', 'quite', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'action', 'scenes', 'due', 'limitations', 'using', 'long', 'string', 'puppets', '.2', 'Symbolism', 'strings', 'holding', 'different', 'parts', 'marionette-character', 'relevance', 'head', 'string', 'Where', 'do', 'strings', 'come', 'Who', 'puppet', 'who', 'puppeteer', 'question', 'equally', 'valid', 'real', 'life', 'including', 'heading', 'title', 'Tied', 'hate', 'Bound', 'love', '.3', 'outstanding', 'labour', 'Mr.', 'Joakim', 'Zacho', 'Weylandt', 'capturing', 'character', 'essence', 'different', 'kinds', 'wood', 'experience', 'worth', 'see', '.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'then', 'may', 'ask', 'why', 'three', 'stars', '-.DISLIKES', 'DVD', 'was', 'opportunity', 'complete', 'what', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'lack', 'time', 'deadline', 'Nevertheless', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Wellspring', 'Media', 'Inc.', 'Genius', 'Entertainment', 'failed', 'opportunity', 'offer', 'good', 'quality', 'product', 'in:1', 'Filling', 'DVD', 'other', 'trailers', 'releases', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'genere', 'concept', 'treated', 'Strings.2', 'Problems', 'transfer', 'least', 'copy', 'purchased', 'scene', 'where', 'Hal', 'sister', 'Jhinna', 'guess', 'be', 'killed', 'close', 'Jhinna', 'face', 'shot', 'be', 'zoomed', 'very', 'few', 'frames', 'making', 'feel', 'jump', 'image', 'shot', 'resource', 'unknown', 'now', '.3', 'Scenes', 'feature', 'really', 'disappointing', 'presentation', 'credits', 'interviews', 'everything', 'direct', 'cut', 'even', 'end', 'way', 'abrupt', 'Wellspring', 'Media', 'told', 'DVD', '-Sorry', 'more', 'time', 'have', 'get', 'DVD', 'complete', 'tomorrow', 'leave', 'way', 'is-', '.Come', 'people', 'are', 'costumers', 'also', 'deserve', 'good', 'products', 'know', 'WOULD', 'LIKE', 'more', 'deep', 'scenes', 'fetturete', 'interviews', 'cast', 'master', 'puppetbuilder.CONCLUSION', 'great', 'movie', 'see', 'better', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'done']",Strings
916543,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0009Y260E,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","Other reviewers have commented on how wonderful this film is and they're right. That you can take a movie starring marionettes and direct them in such a way that the audience feels for them as they would characters in any live action movie is a remarkable feat. Thanks to great voice over work by notable actors, these puppets become true characters.The story is decent but not great. Somewhat Shakespearean in its content, it involves the death of a king by his own hand with the need to get a message to his son to take up the reins and right a terrible wrong done to another race of people. Unfortunately the message never gets to the son but is instead intercepted by the king's 2nd in command who now is going to further the wrongdoing.It is directed like a regular, live action movie with camera angles, close-ups, nifty lighting, great sets and near seamless editing. The characters all have unique faces and voices furthering the sense that you are watching real people. What really caps things off is the fact that these characters know they are attached to strings and that these strings are their life and death. One scene depicting the change of a piece of wood carved like a child into the actual coming to life of that child through the attaching of the strings is at once eerie and touching.I don't know that I'd go back and watch this again merely because the story could have been better, but the achievement is great and should be seen by everyone with a true love of film.",4,A One of Kind Experience,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,1491,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'how', 'wonderful', 'film', ""'re"", 'right', 'can', 'take', 'movie', 'starring', 'marionettes', 'direct', 'way', 'audience', 'feels', 'would', 'characters', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'remarkable', 'feat', 'Thanks', 'great', 'voice', 'work', 'notable', 'actors', 'puppets', 'become', 'true', 'characters.The', 'story', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'Somewhat', 'Shakespearean', 'content', 'death', 'king', 'own', 'hand', 'need', 'get', 'message', 'son', 'take', 'up', 'reins', 'right', 'terrible', 'wrong', 'done', 'race', 'people', 'Unfortunately', 'message', 'never', 'son', 'instead', 'intercepted', 'king', '2nd', 'command', 'who', 'now', 'going', 'further', 'wrongdoing.It', 'directed', 'regular', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'camera', 'angles', 'close-ups', 'nifty', 'lighting', 'great', 'sets', 'seamless', 'editing', 'characters', 'have', 'unique', 'voices', 'furthering', 'sense', 'are', 'watching', 'real', 'people', 'What', 'really', 'caps', 'things', 'off', 'fact', 'characters', 'know', 'are', 'attached', 'strings', 'strings', 'are', 'life', 'death', 'One', 'scene', 'depicting', 'change', 'piece', 'wood', 'carved', 'child', 'actual', 'coming', 'life', 'child', 'attaching', 'strings', 'once', 'eerie', 'touching.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'merely', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'achievement', 'great', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'true', 'love', 'film']",Strings

The whole movie is acted by marionettes with limited facial movement, but seemingly infinite physical limitations.I was startled by the opening sequence. An elderly king sits over his desk, in the rain, writing a suicide letter to his son. My first thought was that it was a bit over-dramatic to have ""rain"" on the inside of his castle, but I went with it. As I carefully followed along to his voice-over, about the two warring civilizations and the ability of his son to unify the country, I saw this king raise his sword over his head......and cut his head-string. Dead.I sat goggle-eyed for the next 90 minutes, seeing things I really couldn't believe.Beautiful shots of strings ascending to the heavens...(I thought, so THAT'S why it was raining indoors. There are no ceilings)...swordfights with warriors aiming for the strings...marionette SURGERY that was horrifying to me, a surgeon!The plot in and of itself is a fairly standard one: nothing new if you've ever read a classic fairy tale or your basic Shakespeare.But the addition of these...these ""strings'...enables the filmmakers to comment on the nature of God, the connectivity between one another, the fragility of life...even the mischief between two children....the birth scene was surprisingly touching. As was a death scene involving a frail old man. The way they re-interpret life and death with ""string"" theory is simply beautiful.There is imagination and creativity in this film at a level I don't think I've ever seen. We're talking Peter Jackson/Steven Spielberg-type cinematic creativity, but also with ingenious storytelling and astonishing visuals.And as you'd expect, the technical puppetry here is beyond belief. The way they get the tilt of a head or a shrug of a shoulder just right. It's amazing. Couple with vocal work by Sir Derek Jacobi, Catherine McCormack and others, you soon stop noticing that the marionettes' mouths do not move.

After all, I live in Denmark, and ""Strings"" was created by a Danish Director and the production company behind it is to a large extent Danish. Furthermore, I had read several positive articles and reviews about the movie before seeing it.The whole concept is very interesting. We are watching a puppet movie, but not one where the puppets represent people. Well, yes, they do in a way, but at the same time the puppets represent puppets.The many strings that go from the various body parts of the puppets and disappear up into the heavens play a major role in the story. A puppet cannot move past any obstacle above his/her head that prevents the strings from passing. To kill a puppet you cut the ""head string"", and a new baby puppet is ""born"" when a new head string is attached to his/her head.Maybe it's my background as an engineer that makes me start to think of all the implications of these concepts. Instead of concentrating on the beautiful photography and the metaphorical side of the story (we, as humans, also have ""strings"" that put limitations on our freedom of movement), I'm thinking about the architectural implications, etc.The story itself is not particularly innovative. A king dies, the king's evil brother tricks the king's son into going on a mission in preparation to waging war on the neighboring puppets, the son slowly but surely determines the truth, he also falls in love, and eventually peace is restored to the land. If it weren't for the interesting puppet-contra-human aspects it would be rather boring.This is not a movie for children, because children see the story as boring and aren't able to grasp the interesting repercussions of the fact that these beings are puppets and not people.As for adults, I'm sure that many will find the movie innovative and artistic and intellectually stimulating. But then there are the people like me who try to analyze the concept to death, and find it hard to concentrate on the story, while not being particularly impressed by the story.Rennie Petersen",3,"Interesting.

916549,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B0009Y260E,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[0, 0]","There is a very short list of live action films that made exclusively with puppets. The Dark Crystal comes to mind as one of the best, and the Thunderbirds films from the 60's come to mind as well. As good as these, and other puppet films, were there is a level of artistry and imagination that only Strings has pulled off. It is a movie like no other. Entirely done with marionettes Strings pulled off a dramatic and beautiful feature film that defies conventional thinking and by that defiance creates its own mythos.The Dark Crystal created an immensely creative and fascinating world. Thunderbirds Are Go! and Thunderbird 6 were essentially expanded stories based on an already highly imaginative television series. While both these franchises are excellent in their own right there is one thing they did that Strings defied. These movies tried to tell their stories by hiding as much as they can the fact you are seeing puppets on the screen. These films were pulling off a sense of reality by using their craft. Strings went the opposite direction and created their own reality.In the world of Strings the people are marionettes. The strings that hold them up are very real and reach out to the sky. Everything about their world evolves around the fact they are living marionettes. Buildings have open ceilings and doorways so the people can get in and out. Barriers to keep people out are mere beams lifted high enough to keep one from moving past the limitations of their tethers. Weapons, maiming, and the act of life and death all evolve around severing the strings that hold them up. This sort of realization takes what would be considered the technical limitation of filming marionettes and creates a whole paradigm shift on how the film world is viewed.A kind dies and his death is covered up and the opposition is blamed. The story in a nutshell sounds rather basic, but it's a little more complicated than that. Not only is there treachery, but also self realization and the idea that not all is at it seems. Enemies turn out to be the good guys rather quickly in this film, and  the hero has to make new choices on what he thinks is right and wrong. The director, Anders Rnnow Klarlund, wanted to do a story about terrorism and how we respond to it. Eventually that idea morphed into Strings, and while the film is a far cry from Karlund's original thought there are still a few influences of that idea still in the script.What sells the story is a combination of elements that make the whole superior to the sum of its parts. The marionette themselves are crafted with a style and artistry that doesn't pretend to make their subjects real. The characters show wood seams and often aren't completely anatomically correct (missing abdomens and so forth), but that belies the point that these aren't supposed to be real people. They are very much puppets, but puppets alone can't build drama. The voice acting in this film is pitch perfect. It feels like a grand Greek play is unfolding. Yet voicing alone is not enough, which makes the puppeteers just as important. They do a great job handling the subtle motions of a living person and the right kind of head movement can emote a good deal. Above this Strings also capitalizes on camera angles, lighting, environmental effects to really drive the emotions of the characters to a level where you often forget about them being puppets; even when it's staring right at you in the face that they are. That is the sign of some great production work.The sets are a spectacle to behold in of themselves. Not only do you see the creativity of this world in the sets like the city gates, the prisons and many other locations even the more conventional sets are impressive when considering the scale of the marionettes. All of the sets were built on a sound stage, and there are many , many sets. No digital manipulation was done on the sets to the backdrops look like painted sets, but that is appropriate for the feel of the movie. The music is just as grand as the sets with a majestic mood that accentuates the drama and emotion of the scene.I don't think Strings was released to theaters other than in a few film festivals, where it received a number of awards and nominations. The DVD cover is a bit misleading as there are no scenes where anybody raises a sword, nor are there any swords in the film (which makes sense considering how you ""kill"" your opponent). This DVD release is rather basic with just a scant few extra features. I would have loved to hear a commentary from the director and master puppeteer Bernd Ogrodnik. Here's what you do get:Behind the Scenes - A short look at putting together a couple scenes. It's cool to see the scale of the sets and get a little look at the technicians priming them, but this is an all too short featurette with no dialog. Just raw footage.Filmographies - This is the kind of feature I remember seeing in the old DVD's from the 90's. It's essentially pages of texts overseeing the careers of the director and four of the primary voice actors up until the film was made. Nothing you can't find on IMDB.Trailer Gallery - This is a number of unrelated trailers for films I am assuming are related to the production company. Sorry... no trailers for Strings. The trailers are for Funny Ha Ha, Palindromes, and Nina's Tragedies.Coming Attractions - This is a number of unrelated trailers for films that were not yet released at the time of the DVD. Those films are Dear Wendy, The Beat That My Heart Skipped, and Kings and Queen.Strings is a surreal experience that I recommend for any fantasy film fan. This is a world you have never seen, nor will you see again I am betting. The DVD may not have a lot of extras, but the film itself is really worth checking out.",5,A surreal use of marionettes,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,5771,"['very', 'short', 'list', 'live', 'action',

916550,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B0009Y260E,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","Here's a perfect example of why genuine creativity & imagination far surpass bloated CGI effects that are momentarily spectacular but hopelessly empty. The unique fantasy world depicted in this stunning film is peopled by marionettes ... and the characters are well aware of their status: their entire way of life, as well as their life-death cycle itself, is built on this fact. The symbolic & psychological overtones are readily apparent, and are certainly fascinating to contemplate. But you'll want to wait until after the story is over to start thinking about those aspects, because the filmmakers deliver a darkly beautiful tale of betrayal, survival, magic & redemption that's gripping from start to finish. As previous reviewers have noted, much of this is familiar in a general way, from countless fairy tales, folk legends, and fantasy novels. But the visualization of it all, coupled with the downright theological considerations of the strings that give life to all -- where exactly do they go, far above the clouds? who, if anyone, is pulling them? -- places this film on another, more mysterious & compelling level entirely. Add to that the sometimes grotesque, sometimes delicate, always beautiful craft of the marionettes & their world, and you're in for a viewing experience quite unlike many, with a truly lovely final image -- most highly recommended!",5,Cutting the strings of Fate,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,1370,"['Here', 'perfect', 'example', 'why', 'genuine', 'creativity', 'imagination', 'far', 'surpass', 'bloated', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'momentarily', 'spectacular', 'hopelessly', 'empty', 'unique', 'fantasy', 'world', 'depicted', 'stunning', 'film', 'peopled', 'marionettes', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'aware', 'status', 'entire', 'way', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'life-death', 'cycle', 'built', 'fact', 'symbolic', 'psychological', 'overtones', 'are', 'readily', 'apparent', 'are', 'certainly', 'fascinating', 'contemplate', ""'ll"", 'want', 'wait', 'story', 'start', 'thinking', 'aspects', 'filmmakers', 'deliver', 'darkly', 'beautiful', 'tale', 'betrayal', 'survival', 'magic', 'redemption', 'gripping', 'start', 'finish', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'much', 'familiar', 'general', 'way', 'countless', 'fairy', 'tales', 'folk', 'legends', 'fantasy', 'novels', 'visualization', 'coupled', 'downright', 'theological', 'considerations', 'strings', 'give', 'life', 'where', 'exactly', 'do', 'go', 'far', 'clouds', 'who', 'anyone', 'pulling', 'film', 'more', 'mysterious', 'compelling', 'level', 'entirely', 'Add', 'sometimes', 'grotesque', 'sometimes', 'delicate', 'always', 'beautiful', 'craft', 'marionettes', 'world', ""'re"", 'viewing', 'experience', 'quite', 'many', 'truly', 'lovely', 'final', 'image', 'most', 'highly', 'recommended']",Strings
916551,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0009Y260E,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[42, 42]","I promise you, you have never seen anything like this.The story is a very good fantasy, a young king coming of age among evil advisors. The presentation is marionettes, some of the most wonderful I've ever seen. Each one is beautifully crafted and articulated, and each is a distinct personality. The puppeteering is superb. The figures move beautifully well, even in unusual actions like swimming. They move well even when they close in with each other so much that their strings risk tangling.What makes this movie unique is the puppets' awareness that they are puppets. The opening scene is a suicide in which one character cuts his own head-strings. Sword-fights center on cutting the other character's strings. Characters are fully aware that they are carved from wood, and subject to the kinds of decay that wood can experience. Even birth consists of a carved, wooden doll, brought to life when - well, you'll have to see for yourself. There's no need for suspension of disbelief, at least at this level: these puppets are clearly and consciously puppets.All of which leaves a strangely involuted question of free will. The characters all act because of their own impulses, but move only when their strings move them. What connects that will to that motion? I wonder whether this is the sense that puppeteers sometimes get, when the painted wooden characters seem to develop personalities of their own.There is nothing like ""Strings.""
