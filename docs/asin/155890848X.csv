AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS somehow manages to get everything wrong in its cheap attempt to appeal to the MTV generation. The three boneheads that were chosen to lead the film create an immediate distance with the audience. Tom Everett Scott is just awful as Andy in an awkward and childish performance. Every attempt he makes to be macho and cool makes him look even more foolish. The computerized effects that replaced Rick Baker's Oscar-award winning makeup were barely passable in 1997, and only age worse with time. If that weren't enough, the confused designs look more like lions or misshapen bears than wolves any day. Only a few of the juvenile jokes get a laugh through its failing attempts at humor.

181066,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,155890848X,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This certainly is a mixed product. One the good side here were dramatic special effects as characters turn into werewolves or other characters become the undead including losing body parts in their mutilated condition. Also on the good side, Tom Everett Scott fully carries this movie and he does a good job playing a goofy character. He is able to play the young male full of bravado, the love struck man, and the hero primarily running from werewolves but eventually confrontational with werewolves. Julie Delpy is perfect for the part since she is such an beautiful and delicate actress, thus serving as a contrast to the monster she becomes. I found the idea of a pack of male werewolves who would sponsor parties so as to catch victims to be clever and the antics of the un-dead to offer some comic relief. However, at some point in the production of the film, someone lost the script or something and anarchy began to take over. At this point the viewer is jerked from scenes of werewolf fights under a cathedral, werewolves eathing half the police in Paris, werewolves on subways, a miracle cure for werewolves coming from a paramedic in an ambulance, and a wedding where the bride and groom jump off the Statue of Liberty.

Moments later I was shaking my head and pondering switching to one of my favorite television shows.This movie is a pale imitation of the original `American Werewolf in London' and I imagine that the director of that 1981 classic John Landis was none to pleased to be associated with this production (in the credits it refers to using characters from the original).Right from the get-go we can tell though that whereas the original had a wicked dry streak of humor to it (one of the tracks was `Blue Moon') this one is instead going to take a more slapstick approach.As the movie begins we join three American friends who are on a round Europe trip taking a series of daredevil stunts. Being obviously hormone driven (they all eye-up a French girl on the train and discuss how European girls are more sophisticated), I would venture a guess they would feel quite at home in a Farrelly brothers production. Upon arrival in the French capital they sneak onto the Eiffel Tower at night and as one of them prepares to bungee jump off the top some quick thinking allows the hapless hero to save a girls life.Left with only the girls shoe the three track down the girl down after which time they discover her deep secret.This may be some people's idea of a great or fun movie.

To top it off, all this absolutely innovative and realistic special effects was matched with a smart, funny script, terrific acting, and a witty soundtrack--it's still one of the best horror films ever made.So it's no surprise that a sequel would be made, and it's no surprise that the sequel falls short, especially given that none of the major personalities involved in the original returned.  Directing, script, acting, special effects, music, are all in different and apparently less proficient hands.  It's not that American Werewolf in Paris is a bad movie, not by a long shot, but it pales in comparison to its parent.Two major weaknesses mar the film.  The first, and most serious, is that it all too often tries too hard to be funny, and falls flat.  Most of the humor is abandoned toward the end in favor of action and at that point the movie improves, but early scenes made me suspect the whole thing was going to be a failure.  The second flaw is that the CGI werewolves are really inferior  They blend badly with the live action at several points, and frankly it's almost always hard to really make them out, especially their faces.  In England, the Werewolves were shown often and in great detail, but apparently in France they are quite a bit more shy.  The Parisian undead also suffer in comparison--gory, yes, but not terribly realistic or frightening.Nonetheless, American Werewolf in Paris did have its delights.  There's a good duel between two werewolves that's the best CGI in the film, but it's quite short.  The climax of the film is well done and very satisfying, even if it is rather predictable.  Perhaps some viewers will even prefer this film over the original for its lesser intensity.  Worth watching, even worth buying for horror buffs, but lower your expectations from the original for best results.",3,Weaker Relative of A Strong English Parent,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,2463,"['Thanks', 'George', 'Gershin', 'American', 'Paris', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'Paris', 'was', 'natural', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'was', 'even', 'calling', 'first', 'film', 'not', 'terribly', 'funny', 'joke', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'was', 'terrific', 'film', 'breaking', 'new', 'grounds', 'werewolf', 'transformations', 'were', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'revoltingly', 'gory', 'bubbling', 'hideous', 'seeping', 'stretching', 'changes', 'made', 'audience', 'realize', 'how', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'painful', 'becoming', 'werewolf', 'would', 'be', 'then', 'was', 'lead', 'character', 'best', 'friend', 'tortured', 'corpse', 'who', 'kept', 'decaying', 'disgusting', 'detail', 'film', 'top', 'off', 'absolutely', 'innovative', 'realistic', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'matched', 'smart', 'funny', 'script', 'terrific', 'acting', 'witty', 'soundtrack', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'made.So', 'surprise', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'surprise', 'sequel', 'short', 'especially', 'given', 'none', 'major', 'personalities', 'involved', 'original', 'returned', 'Directing', 'script', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'are', 'different', 'apparently', 'less', 'proficient', 'hands', 'not', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'Paris', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'comparison', 'parent.Two', 'major', 'weaknesses', 'mar', 'film', 'first', 'most', 'serious', 'too', 'often', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'flat', 'Most', 'humor', 'abandoned', 'end', 'favor', 'action', 'point', 'movie', 'early', 'scenes', 'made', 'suspect', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'failure', 'second', 'flaw', 'CGI', 'werewolves', 'are', 'really', 'inferior', 'blend', 'badly', 'live', 'action', 'several', 'points', 'frankly', 'almost', 'always', 'hard', 'really', 'make', 'out', 'especially', 'England', 'Werewolves', 'were', 'shown', 'often', 'great', 'detail', 'apparently', 'France', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'shy', 'Parisian', 'undead', 'also', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'gory', 'yes', 'not', 'terribly', 'realistic', 'frightening.Nonetheless', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'Paris', 'did', 'have', 'delights', 'good', 'duel', 'two', 'werewolves', 'best', 'CGI', 'film', 'quite', 'short', 'climax', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'satisfying', 'even', 'rather', 'predictable', 'Perhaps', 'viewers', 'will', 'even', 'prefer', 'film', 'original', 'lesser', 'intensity', 'Worth', 'watching', 'even', 'worth', 'buying', 'horror', 'buffs', 'lower', 'expectations', 'original', 'best', 'results']",N/A

Andy (Tom Everett Scott) and two of his friends travel to Paris. One night while attempting a stunt off the top of the Eiffel Tower, he sees a woman (Julie Delpy) who is about to jump off and fall to her death. He saves her life and is instantly mesmerized by her. But there's something about her that he doesn't know: a full moon will bring out the beast in her, literally. Of course, he eventually gets bitten and the fun begins.I suppose I should mention the film's shortcomings first and get that out of the way. For one, it relies on CGI for the warewolf scenes. It's rather unconvincing most of the time. And second, the blend of horror and comedy simply does not work as it did in &quot;An American Warewolf In London.&quot; Not to overly compare the two, but &quot;An American Warewolf In Paris *is* technically its sequel and therefore must be compared at least somewhat.But that's really all there is in terms of flaws. Everything else about it works. Tom Everett Scott is great in his role and Julie Delpy is excellent as the mysterious and beautiful woman who steals his heart. And her nude scene, while brief, is certainly a nice bonus!I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed &quot;An American Warewolf In London&quot; or anyone who just likes a brainless scary flick.

Director Anthony Waller has created more of a remake than a sequel to the earlier and hugely successful AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.  Waller updates the plot, the music, the characters, and the special effects rather than establishes a worthy cinematic descendant that can stand on its own four feet.  To mention the plot of AAWP is merely to rehash the plot of AAWL.  Tom Everett Scott has the David Naughton role while Julie Delpy has the Jenny Agutter one.  The only variance is that Delpy is a female werewolf who bites Scott, forcing him to acknowledge that the only way for him to reclaim his humanity is to kill Delpy, whom he loves, by munching on her heart.  Part of my dissolutionment with AAWP is that the ugliness of the stereotyped American abroad has been transformed to that of homegrown Parisians who hate all things American and seek to spread their hatred by biting anyone from the red, white, and blue.  The scene in the nightclub that is full of American tourists takes on a new and unsettling nuance given the recent rash of murderous attacks on American soldiers in conquered Iraq.  Here, a pack of Frenchified werewolves pack a nightclub with American tourists and then lock the doors.  When they transform themselves, the resulting gore evaporates any leavening humor that might have preceded it, replacing it with a nihilistic ugliness that might have been approved of by anti-American mullahs.  After that scene, it is hard to get back on track with a movie that treats Americans as foolish pieces of bubble-headed meat.  The entire film is dedicated to the proposition that all Americans are created equally dumb, reprehensible, and edible.  Even technological advances in prosthetic elongation do not compensate for a film that tries mightily hard to recapture the success of an earlier film that did succeed in treating Americans abroad with a winning combination of humor, horror, and sympathy.

But as an updated version in an entirely different city it does a pretty good job.  The Werewolf effects were great, the death scenes very graphic and bloody.  It was pretty obvious that the effects were CGI but being a horror movie my disbelief was already pretty much in the stratosphere.  The beautiful French actress, Julie Delpy is great and Tom Everret Scott plays the lead very well.  The only thing that gets me is that it took so damn long for a sequel to An American Werewolf in London and yet there have been several sequels to The Howling, which is just a terrible werewolf film.  There needs to be more American Werewolf movies!  If you're a Horror/gore fan this movie is right up your alley.  Arguing corpses, neo-nazi Werewolves and a great sense of humor make this an enjoyable sequel to the original that's far better than the Howling (if you like The Howling, I'd suggest checking out Howling V: Rebirth, it's a pretty spooky movie with good werewolf effects).  All in all if you loved the first movie you'll at least like the second, so check it out all you little lycanthropes!",4,An Enjoyable Sequel with Great Werewolf Effects,971913600,"10 19, 2000",2000,1244,"['Bear', 'mind', 'would', 'take', 'nothing', 'short', 'miracle', 'surpass', 'originality', 'greatness', 'original', 'film', 'movie', 'based', 'updated', 'version', 'entirely', 'different', 'city', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Werewolf', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'death', 'scenes', 'very', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'was', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'effects', 'were', 'CGI', 'being', 'horror', 'movie', 'disbelief', 'was', 'already', 'pretty', 'much', 'stratosphere', 'beautiful', 'French', 'actress', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'great', 'Tom', 'Everret', 'Scott', 'lead', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'thing', 'took', 'so', 'damn', 'long', 'sequel', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'yet', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'sequels', 'Howling', 'just', 'terrible', 'werewolf', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'movies', ""'re"", 'Horror/gore', 'fan', 'movie', 'right', 'alley', 'Arguing', 'corpses', 'neo-nazi', 'Werewolves', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'sequel', 'original', 'far', 'better', 'Howling', 'like', 'Howling', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'checking', 'out', 'Howling', 'V', 'Rebirth', 'pretty', 'spooky', 'movie', 'good', 'werewolf', 'effects', 'loved', 'first', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'least', 'second', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'little', 'lycanthropes']",N/A

They sneak onto the Eiffel Tower to bungee jump.  However a girl also is there and she tries to jump.  Our hero saves her life and she tries to avoid him at every turn.  That's because she's cursed with being a werewolf!There's a bunch of slapstick comedy in this film and some rock tunes to liven a rather tired script.  New things are introduced regarding the werewolf myth:  Any kind of bullets kill them and not just silver ones.  In fact this film could use a silver lining.  Another thing is the ""undead"" which are really spirits killed by werewolves who are doomed to walk the earth until the werewolf who made them that way dies and eat their hearts.But when one of our friends is killed and ""doomed to walk the earth"" he goes away when his werewolf is merely shot.  Huh?Hey, try not to think too hard.""London"" is a better film than this one.  We have bad werewolves who wish to clean the Earth of crazies and druggies, so what better way than to eat them alive at raves.  They lock up the doors and tear them apart.Cute romance with the werewolf girl, some comedy with dog interaction and some fun with red meat and mixing hearts in a blender.This movie will not steal your heart, sadly.  Great special effects and big red claw marks, eyes and blood popping out, should satisfy some gore fiends, but that's about it.Film for fans of werewolf movies and fans of An American Werewolf in London.
