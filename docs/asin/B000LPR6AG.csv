1039785,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B000LPR6AG,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[3, 16]","I remember watching ""family Affair"" as a small child in the late 60s and early 70s. Being of course too young to fully understand the episodes, I enjoyed and related to it mostly because I was a kid at the time and enjoyed seeing other small children on such a show. So it was with eager anticipation that I brought this set, as I vividly recalled some of these stories after not seeing them since about 1972 when I was 7 going on 8.What a difference 35 years makes.Sebastian Cabot (Mr. French) is still the coolest beard-wearer around, and its shocking to learn in the special feature that he was actualy Canadian and not British (says a lot for his acting ability). But these stories almost to a one are too mawkish, sugary, and cornball to modern tastes. Buffy and Jody are WAY too goody-twoshoes for kids to really identify with, and their sickening constant lisps of ""Uncle Beeeill"" really grate on the nerves after a while. I guess that in the just-beginning to be cynical sixties, this show was a relief from the calamity of the reality of the time, but kids today would clearly see this as a product of another era.The latch key kid, Albertine (who I had a crush on as a child), and future Brady-girl Eve Plumb as the child with Leukemia, really push the envelope with tales that harken back to old fashioned melodramas with Little Nell being put off the farm into the snow. One just waits to see a villan with a top hat and black cape twirling his moustache shouting ""I must have the rent!"" The three parter in Spain where B&J; get lost in the wilderness among peasant farmers has one of the most unbeleivable and hokey endings in television history.Yeah, to sixties and seventies childen this will stand tall in your memories largely due to nostalgia for the days when you came home from school watching this to milk and cookies.

As for people thinking Johnny Whitaker is purposely banning any participation in the extras, let me assure you that is not the case.  I have contacted him directly.  He told me around Christmas 2006, he had no idea why he wasn't being asked to participate.  MPI at the time had not been responding to any of his attempts to contact them regarding why he wasn't being asked to participate in the extras.

Thank God that DVD is bringing back these wonderful classic television programs.  Season 3 of Family Affair is charming and engaging, poignant, thought-provoking and with messages that touch the heart.  I always remembered the ""Lost in Spain"" episode because it made me cry.  So too ""The Latch Key Kid"" and ""Christmas Came a Little Early"".  ""By a Whisker"" is hilarious!!So what if Buffy and Jody were portrayed as goody-two-shoes?  I'm sorry but Jody cutting Mr. French's whiskers while he was asleep was NOT being exactly a model child.  But if they were portrayed as a goody-two-shoes it was because they were brought up with standards and strict disciplinary rules.  I see nothing unrealistic about this.  It would do parents well to observe these tactics and employ them with the rearing of their own children today....those who care enough to do so.  Children today are crying out for discipline and rules...take the ""Latch Key Kid"" for example.  We have a child whose mother could care less about her.  She has all the freedom in the world to do everything she wants.  But is she happy?  No.  She spends a weekend with Buffy and gets a taste of what ""discipline and rules"" are all about.  She knows that Buffy and Jody are loved because someone cares enough to teach them good manners and discipline them.  Buffy on the other hand wants to experience the freedom that Lana has and comes to realize that the grass isn't always greener and comes to appreciate the love that her family has for her.  This is just one example of the morals and standards this show strived to promote.  Another great example is the ""Cissy"" episode entitled ""Flower Power Child"".  Same principles.  Uncle Bill gives Cissy the opportunity to experience freedom and she comes to realize that the ""hippie"" movement (a timely topic for that time) is not all it seems to be either.  The show has great messages that are still timely and we need them now more than ever.",5,Still Holds Up Well After All These Years....,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,2013,"['Would', 'would', 'have', 'series', 'today', 'television', 'Thank', 'God', 'DVD', 'bringing', 'back', 'wonderful', 'classic', 'television', 'programs', 'Season', '3', 'Family', 'Affair', 'charming', 'engaging', 'poignant', 'thought-provoking', 'messages', 'touch', 'heart', 'always', 'remembered', 'Lost', 'Spain', 'episode', 'made', 'cry', 'So', 'too', 'Latch', 'Key', 'Kid', 'Christmas', 'Came', 'Little', 'Early', 'Whisker', 'hilarious', 'So', 'what', 'Buffy', 'Jody', 'were', 'portrayed', 'goody-two-shoes', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Jody', 'cutting', 'Mr.', 'French', 'whiskers', 'was', 'asleep', 'was', 'NOT', 'being', 'exactly', 'model', 'child', 'were', 'portrayed', 'goody-two-shoes', 'was', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'standards', 'strict', 'disciplinary', 'rules', 'see', 'nothing', 'unrealistic', 'would', 'do', 'parents', 'well', 'observe', 'tactics', 'employ', 'rearing', 'own', 'children', 'today', '.those', 'who', 'enough', 'do', 'so', 'Children', 'today', 'are', 'crying', 'out', 'discipline', 'rules', 'take', 'Latch', 'Key', 'Kid', 'example', 'have', 'child', 'mother', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'freedom', 'world', 'do', 'everything', 'happy', 'No', 'weekend', 'Buffy', 'taste', 'what', 'discipline', 'rules', 'are', 'Buffy', 'Jody', 'are', 'loved', 'someone', 'cares', 'enough', 'teach', 'good', 'manners', 'discipline', 'Buffy', 'other', 'hand', 'experience', 'freedom', 'Lana', 'realize', 'grass', ""n't"", 'always', 'greener', 'appreciate', 'love', 'family', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'morals', 'standards', 'show', 'strived', 'promote', 'great', 'example', 'Cissy', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Flower', 'Power', 'Child', 'Same', 'principles', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'Cissy', 'opportunity', 'experience', 'freedom', 'realize', 'hippie', 'movement', 'timely', 'topic', 'time', 'not', 'be', 'either', 'show', 'great', 'messages', 'are', 'still', 'timely', 'need', 'now', 'more', 'ever']",N/A

My niece, who rather resembled Jones, died when she herself was thirteen.So, I had to get Season Three for the sake of ""Christmas Came a Little Early"" to watch a young Eve Plumb fight her own battle, presumably with leukemia.  This episode was rarely shown in reruns, probably because it was too heartbreaking.""Family Affair"" was one of the last of the really sweet shows.  The obnoxious ""All in the Family"" era came in its wake, and television was never the same.Watching ""Family Affair"" in reruns as an adult I am struck by what a deeply loving person and outstanding ""parent"" Uncle Bill was.  This show offered far more than sitcom fluff, and many times it gave adults and children alike positive examples of how people should treat one another.Strictly speaking, the three children were orphans, yet they lived privileged lives in a New York City penthouse with a full-time man-servant.  Yet the kids were not at all arrogant, and they proved every time to be empathatic toward other children facing their own challenges in life.Brian Keith had his own combination of biological and adoptive children.  He was fatherly toward Anissa Jones, whose own home life was an unfortunate disaster.Keith's role in the ""Parent Trap"" would prove to be a forerunner of his role in ""Family Affair"".  Take a man that was attractive to women, add a pair of twins, and you have one of filmdom's most charismatic and lovable father figures.I love watching Keith in both of these roles.  Once in a while you will see a glimpse of the tattoo on his bicep.  I am guessing this was a memento of his tour of duty in the Marines.Thanks for the memories, Mr. Keith.

The special feature is a 30 minute ""Family Affair Reunion Special"" featuring Kathy Garver (who played Sissy), Sherry Alberoni (who played Sissy's bets friend and upstairs neighbor, Sharon), producer John Stephens and husband and wife writers Austin ""Rocky"" Kalish and Irma Kalish. The five sit in a semi-circle and chat for 30 minutes, offering lots of fascinating background information about the cast members (Irma remembers Brian Keith as never speaking to her on the set and Stephens remembers his prickly personality; Kathy adored him), the show's legacy and the interesting way the show was shot.Each season the show got Brian Keith for just 65 days to shoot all his scenes for a season's worth of episodes. (The series was shot this way to give Keith time to keep filming motion pictures.) This meant that all the episodes had to be written before the season began and in most cases the episodes were filmed ahead of time, missing only the scenes that required Brian Keith. Producer Stephens remembers that when they were filmingw ith Keith, they would often work on 4 or 5 episodes in one day! He called its ""organized chaos"" and credits director Charles Barton, who filmed every episode.We learn about Anissa Jones not being happy to still be dragging around her Mrs Beasley doll by season four when she was 12 (she was 9 years old in the first season when the twins were suposed to be 6) and both Stephens and Mr Kalish don't have positive things to say about her mother. On a more humorous note, we hear about Sebastian Cabot measuring the length of Keith's trailer to make sure it wasn't larger than his. We also find out that Cabot had broken his wrist during season one (which explains the bandages on his one hand in season one) and it required surgury, which is why John Williams replaced him in a handful of episodes that season. We also find out that the 3-part episode LOST IN SPAIN was totally filmed on the network's backlot, using sets from the TV series ""From Rome With Love.""This is a wonderful, chatty and informative feature. Its too bad that no one could convince Johnny Whittaker (""Jody"") to participate. It would be great to get a few commentary tracks with him and Garver in the fourth or fifth season.This show is thought of as a sitcom, but its really much more of a drama-dy. You better have some tissues near when watching ""Christmas Came A Little Early"" where Buffy befriends a young homebound classmate (played by BRADY BUNCH's Eve Plumb) who has leukemia. And you have to admire the restraint and power of some of the more dramatic episodes of this season, especially ""The Latch Key Kid"" where Buffy's new friend, Lana, seems to live a very enviable life as a latch key kid who makes her own dinner and stays up as late as she wishes or ""Albertine"" where the twins try to get close to a new black student who's real life may be very different than what she presents.This is a show that has been long out of syndication. Thanks to MPI, we have uncut episodes to treasure. (One small complaint, I wish the episodes had chapter breaks.)

Maybe I just remember these episodes better, from when they were on in the sixties.  One of the best is ""Christmas Came a Little Early"".  Anybody that can watch it without getting a lump in their throat is made of stone! My 7 and 10 year-old sons watched ""Oliver"" with me and thought it was hilarious. I think MPI has turned out another wonderful product.  The sound and picture quality is great.  I also thought that the ""Reunion"" fature on disc 5 was very enjoyable and interesting.

1039800,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000LPR6AG,trebe,"[0, 0]","I only occasionally watched Family Affair (1966-1971) when I was growing up, but fortunately I was finally able to become reacquainted with this terrific program, and discover what a well-written and acted show it really is.When I watch the show, I can't help but reflect upon a number of very sad events.  One is Anissa Jones' tragic death due to a drug overdose, at the age of 18.  She was so pure and innocent as Buffy, but unfortunately her life after the series was cancelled, was quite turbulent and troubled.  Brian Keith (1921-97) was an actor who could have a hard edge, but as Uncle Bill he was a soft spoken and lovable teddy bear.  Failing health and depression caused Keith to take his own life.  Sebastian Cabot (1918-1977) also had an untimely death, due to a stroke, and Johnnie Whitaker had some issues with substance abuse.Putting those gloomy matters aside, although the Davis' family unit was atypical, the love and understanding displayed on Family Affair, clearly captured the imagination of the American public.  The program debuted in Nielsen's top 20, and became ratings gold, as the fifth most popular TV program for each of the next three seasons.Bill Davis (Keith), a successful civil engineer and businessman in New York City, unexpected becomes the guardian of his dead brother's three children.  Cissy (Kathy Garver), and twins Buffy (Jones) and Jody (Johnnie Whitaker), all come to live with their Uncle Bill, and his live-in butler Giles French (Cabot).  In Season 3, Cissy is now aged 17, while the twins are 8.The experiences of Jody and Buffy, is the focus of most of the stories, as their mostly innocent activities, often result in situations that prove challenging to their Uncle Bill, a man learning about parenting on the fly.  The children are truly adorable, with the angelic looking Anissa Jones, complimented by the boyish charm of Johnnie Whitaker.While Family Affair has some appeal to children, it is a program that appears to have been mainly targeted at an older audience, particularly those who are parents.  The program looks at various parental situations and moral dilemmas, and attempts to come up with sensible and workable solutions.  Uncle Bill is a laid back thoughtful guy, who manages to remain calm, no matter what happens.  While Mr. French, is the model of decorum and dignity.  Together, they work as a team for the children's best interest.  Understanding the complexity of Davis and French, and the nuances of their relationship, is not something that most youngsters would be capable of.The series often tackled ""heavy"" subjects, and perhaps the most poignant episode is ""Christmas Came a Little Early This Year"", where Buffy meets a girl played by Eve Plum, who is weak and bedridden.  The girls become fast friends, and Uncle Bill asks a specialist to look into the case.  Unfortunately, the girl is terminally ill, and the Davis' celebrate Christmas early, so the dying girl can experience some happiness.Other episodes with mature storylines include, ""A Lesson for Grown-Ups"", where the collapse of a bridge under construction in Africa, threatens to bankrupt Bill Davis.  The Davis family receives several letters which seriously defame Mr. French's character, in ""The Matter of Dignity.  Surveillance is the subject of ""A Matter of Privacy"", when Bill Davis discovers that his office is ""bugged"", and the twins get involved with a boy who secretly tape records conversations.Being more mature and level headed, Cissy (real name Catherine) is less prone to getting in trouble, although when it occasionally happens, it's usually something major.  In ""Flip Side"", she becomes involved with a famous pop singer, who even writes a song for her.  When the boy leaves town on tour, Cissy fears that she may have been forgotten.  Cissy is reminded of the real meaning of love, when she is invited to come and live with two liberated hippie chicks in ""Flower Power"".  And in ""A Waltz From Vienna"", Bill Davis' refusal to give Cissy permission to marry, causes her to reassess her priorities in life.Multi-part episodes often lack the substance to sustain interest, and that is the case with the three part adventure ""Lost In Spain"", where Bill Davis takes a job in Spain, and brings the family along.  When Jody and Buffy get lost, even the civil guard is called out to search for them.  It's a rare instance where the focus is on adventure, and poor results in this instance serves to illustrate that Family Affair is clearly at its best when exploring issues related to morality, raising kids, and family dynamics.  It's a program willing to address weighty issues in a straightforward, reasonable, and gentle manner.Admittedly, the 60's is a long time ago, and Family Affair is dated in many respects, but certain basic truths still apply.  For parents who appreciate the wonderful innocence of childhood, Family Affair is highly recommended.  The cast is marvelous, and only a few weak episodes, drop the third season's rating down to 4.5 stars.Family Affair is certainly quite watchable, but image quality isn't the sharpest.  A plus is that the episodes are subtitled, but having no chapter stops is inconvenient.  Season Three features 28 episodes on five discs.  A bonus is a 30 minute long reunion that features cast members Kathy Garver and Sherry Alberoni, producer John Stephens, and writers Austin and Erma Kalish.  There are plenty of warm memories of working on the show, and of Brian Keith, but disappointingly, little is said about Anissa Jones or Johnnie Whitaker.",5,"a truly heartwarming family program, that
