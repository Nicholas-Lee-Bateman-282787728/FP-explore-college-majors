Hurt and Tilly must have received no direction and worse script because they come off as zombies.  The plot is about Hurt and Tilly's 10 yr. old daughter being chased by killers who know she witnessed them murdering a man. The killers are laughably incompetent....just not over-the-top enough. The movie is billed as a tense thriller.  It is only tense in that you will squirm to see such fine actors look ridiculous in this mess. ""Home Alone"" pulled this off.  Originally titled ""Do Not Disturb"".  Good advice.

He even has trouble maintaining a Southern accent throughout the film, sometimes using one, sometimes not.  Dennis Leary, the comic turned actor, is also wasted here but his onscreen time is very small.  The plot is that Hurt's daughter, a mute ten year old, witnesses a murder in Amsterdam.  For the rest of the movie, the villain's hit man tries to kill the girl.  Not only can this ten year old manage to constantly foil a &quot;professional,&quot; but this hit man must have failed Hit Man School.  He absolutely cannot do anything right in carrying out his job and cannot even manage to own a gun that works properly.

While they are there his daughter, a mute, witnesses a murder.  She is pursued by the murderers and shows courage and resourcefulness which would be extremely rare in a 10-year-old.

Charming place.I enjoyed the boat bum.  All the parts where the girl gets the best of the hitman were so unbelievable.  In one part a supposed 10-year-old (she looks 16, if she's a day), swings from a beam in an elevator shaft and kicks the hitman off balance.  Picture a normal sized 10-year-old girl doing this.  Which makes the whole thing really nutty.  Oh, and the ambulance chase with the William Hurt character hanging on outside was pure Charlie Chaplin.  I expected him to lose an arm grabbing the crowbar at such high speed.

566036,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000053VC1,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Well, I admit, this is a very, very silly film by cult Dutch film maker Dick Maas, starring William Hurt, Jennifer Tilly, and Dennis Leary.  Like all the Maas's films -- did you see Naomi Watts in ""The Shaft""? -- ""Silent Witness"" is an uncomfortable blend of thrill and laugh, and though the actors try their best, the result is not as good as is intended.The film is also titled ""Do Not Disturb,"" and quite appropriately starts with the scene where newly-arrived family (Hurt and Tilly ... most unlikely husband and wife) check in Hotel De L'Europe in Amsterdam.  They also have a pretty daughter (Francesca Brown) who cannot speak (hence, Silent Witness), who, well, witnesses a murder done by a hitman (Corey Johnson).The rest of the film is about the 10 year-old girl's attempt to save her life and tell the truth to the parents.  The cat-and-mouse situation sometimes becomes silly when this girl can foil the professional hitman's attacks, displaying the impossible ruses you can never imagine yourself.  And when in real trouble, an American Dennis Leary (who happens to live in the small boat in the city's canal) offers a help.Still, ridiculous as it is, the film is always good to see for its locations.  The seductive charms of the night of Amsterdam are beautifully captured, and after all Dick Maas lived in this city for more than 25 years, so why not?  And the film comes with the surprisingly good action sequences shot on the streets of the city.If you have absolutely nothing to do, or just want to see the beautiful city of Amsterdam, ""Silent Witness"" is a place to go.  Otherwise, stick to Bruce Willis's ""Die Hard"" which this film is definitely not.",3,"Silly, Impossible Action in Amsterdam Starring Hurt & Tilly",1085011200,"05 20, 2004",2004,1670,"['Well', 'admit', 'very', 'very', 'silly', 'film', 'cult', 'Dutch', 'film', 'maker', 'Dick', 'Maas', 'starring', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'Maas', 'films', 'did', 'see', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Shaft', 'Silent', 'Witness', 'uncomfortable', 'blend', 'thrill', 'laugh', 'actors', 'try', 'best', 'result', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'intended.The', 'film', 'also', 'titled', 'Do', 'Not', 'Disturb', 'quite', 'appropriately', 'scene', 'where', 'newly-arrived', 'family', 'Hurt', 'Tilly', 'most', 'unlikely', 'husband', 'wife', 'check', 'Hotel', 'De', ""L'Europe"", 'Amsterdam', 'also', 'have', 'pretty', 'daughter', 'Francesca', 'Brown', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'hence', 'Silent', 'Witness', 'who', 'well', 'murder', 'done', 'hitman', 'Corey', 'Johnson', '.The', 'rest', 'film', '10', 'year-old', 'girl', 'attempt', 'save', 'life', 'tell', 'truth', 'parents', 'cat-and-mouse', 'situation', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'when', 'girl', 'can', 'foil', 'professional', 'hitman', 'attacks', 'displaying', 'impossible', 'ruses', 'can', 'never', 'imagine', 'when', 'real', 'trouble', 'American', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'who', 'live', 'small', 'boat', 'city', 'canal', 'help.Still', 'ridiculous', 'film', 'always', 'good', 'see', 'locations', 'seductive', 'charms', 'night', 'Amsterdam', 'are', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'Dick', 'Maas', 'lived', 'city', 'more', '25', 'years', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'shot', 'streets', 'city.If', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'beautiful', 'city', 'Amsterdam', 'Silent', 'Witness', 'place', 'go', 'Otherwise', 'stick', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Die', 'Hard', 'film', 'definitely', 'not']",N/A
