367925,A11SSYM4ISRN1I,6303274420,gclaheh,"[1, 1]","This movie was very entertaining.  Meredith Baxter does an excellent job acting in this one.  The whole time I was watching this, I thought this is NOT going to end well.  I didn't expect this dude and his wife to be murdered in the end.  I kept asking myself, why couldn't Betty let it go and move on with her life.There are some things in the movie that didn't make sense.  Like, why did Dan ask his girlfriend to move in with him immediately after the divorce?  Why did he allow his live in girlfriend to go to his oldest daughter's graduation?  Why didn't he change his number or ask a third party to communicate between him and Betty?  Or better  yet why didn't he move?  Then I did some research and I found that this is very one sided.After doing the research, here is what I think really happened.  I think Betty put him through medical school and law school by working and taking care of the kids, while Dan just goes to school.  Betty grew to resent him and screamed at him after work every evening or acted nutty and Dan dealt with that by avoiding this nagpie even more.  Rather than telling Betty how he really feels, he finds this little gold digger Linda to have an affair with.  Linda puts pressure on him to leave his wife and he eventually does.  Betty has a hard time dealing with the divorce and Dan remarrying Linda and gets even crazier, but Dan makes all kinds of really dumb decisions like inviting Linda to his daughter's graduation.I think that Betty is totally crazy and she should've just let go of her anger and move on.  She is an insult to women everywhere and is definitely not a feminist.  I do understand why she was angry and I think that Dan should've showed more sensitivity to her or try to understand why she was angry instead of writing her off as a crazy person.  I have a dealt with someone who is angry like Betty, and I have to say that I wouldn't act like Dan.  I would go out of my way to get along with them-I wouldn't start another relationship with another person if my ex had that much trouble dealing with it.

In fact, this movie is based on a magazine article. I have never heard of a movie that was based on a magazine article, have you?It goes without saying that Meredith Baxter didn't bother to speak to Betty, instead she took her instruction from an overzealous director (Dick Lowry.) The Betty in this movie is a crazy, manipulative, lunatic. The real Betty Broderick bares no resemblance to her. However, I still felt sorry the Betty in this movie. Because her husband was a totally insensitive gentleman to say the very least. He had no respect for his wife or children.I never got the impression that I was watching Betty Broderick. Instead, it was like watching Elyse Keaton with a very bad bleach-job. The writers of this ""movie"" did absolutely no research. They didn't bother to explain any of the events leading up to Betty's breakdown.I did like the part at the high school graduation. It was so funny when Linda made that feeble attempt to put Betty in her place, ""if you snap another picture of me you'll be taking a picture from the inside of your mouth..."" I guess breaking up her marriage and stealing her husband, her children and her home wasn't enough for Linda? But Betty just looked her right in the eye and snapped a picture without blinking.The movie never conveyed what led up to Betty's horrible breakdown. Instead, they show her buying a gun and screaming hysterically at everyone who will listen. This just isn't her story. Mrs. Broderick has even said in subsequent interviews that this movie helped poison the public's mind because the jury already thought they knew ""her story.""The second TV movie picked up just after Betty's breakdown is called: Her Final Fury: Betty Broderick, the Last Chapter. This movie aired on TV on November 1, 1992. Again Meredith Baxter plays Mrs. Broderick and Judith Ivey plays the prosecuting attorney.This movie was more foolish than the first and in all likelihood should not have been made. The movie also incorrectly implied that the children were raised by Dan's family; they actually ended up in foster care.Again, like first made-for-TV-spectacle, Betty is totally in a rage in the entire movie but nothing is explained or detailed. She is just so filled with hate and angry all of the time. Why? Again, this movie has no resemblance to Betty's story.If you're interested in learning about the real Betty Broderick, watch some of her TV interviews and read some of her magazine articles. There's also a good book by Bella Stumbo.

367942,A3KM9UA6MAVURN,6303274420,"pjf ""pjf""","[7, 11]","This movie gets four or five stars for entertainment, only 2 or 3 for accuracy.  I suppose its inevitable that with material like a scorned wife driving her car into and otherwise vandalizing her ex-husband's house, they wouldn't capitalize on making this movie as over the top as they could.  And contrasting the husband as a saint for good measure.If you read just a little,however,  you discover the husband was very far from the saint he was portrayed in this movie.  What he did to his wife and his children (who used to hide in the bushes to get away from him) made me almost believe Betty had some justification.  And I only read about him, I didn't live with him for all those years.As for Linda, well, I am not married, so I have no personal ax to grind, but I believe that this idea that one should be allowed to have an affair and break up a family with children and go blameless is wrong. Yet in our society, such behavior is considered blameless. Why is it acceptable in our society that women and men should have no morals in this regard?  Women who would never be caught stealing from a store, have affairs with married men with children and don't consider that a crime?  While murder is not an appropriate consequence, there ought to be some consequence because it is not a victimless crime.  At the very least society should regard them with the attitude their low character grants them.  Breaking up a family, the emotional anguish it causes the wife and children should not be an act without consequences. And yet it has none for the person who does this to a family.I agree with Dot hutelmeyer, who successfully sued her husband's mistress for breaking up her marriage.  There ought to be consequences for doing what Linda did.  And as for Dan, marriage, particularly when there are children involved, is something you should have to earn your way out of, with counseling. Not just walk in one day and say, thanks for twenty years but I've found someone who looks like you, not ravaged by twenty years of working and raising my children,  so I'm leaving you for a younger model. Essentially that's what Dan Broderick did. Shame on him and Linda both.While no one deserves murder, what happened to Betty Broderick was a crime, just one unrecognized by society.  While she reacted poorly, she was an unbalanced individual (and after years of marriage to Dan no wonder, he encouraged her to think she was crazy by denying his affair) who reacted extravagently in some desperate attempt to get justice for what she felt happened to her, when she was getting justice no where else.It's interesting in our society that so little is done to protect families from what happened to Betty and her children.  A family is more than an emotional tie, it's also something of a corporation.  Women have been given the vote. Supposedly, after many years, there are now some laws to protect women from battering. But nothing protects a women from sinking years of her life, emotionally, physically and economically into building a home, having children, and raising them in a family and then having her husband, the man she's done all this supposedly for and with, have a cheap affair and walk out one day without any real consequences for him or the mistress --  cheat her not only emotionally, but legally, morally, economically and in every other way. Dan didn't even pay for her divorce lawyer, hid assets, used the legal system against her.  She had no representation in court even to try to get some justice.  What kind of way is that to treat your wife and children?Women as just supposed to go quietly into the night,set up to fail,  broken emotionally, financially and legally. Society not only allows for this, it expects it, teaching that you get a man for being young and beautiful and to lose one for being older and no longer beautiful is the ultimate disgrace.  But Betty didn't creep away, and that's her infamy.  But part of that infamy is perhaps the recognition within society that she rebelled against an inequity that has yet to be addressed and hurts millions of women and children. It's okay by society to be a mistress, but not to rage out against the person or persons who destroyed the home you spent twenty years building.  For centuries, it was accepted that men would be enraged by someone who stole their wife.  We're allowed to defend our property. But as women, we're supposed to just move on with our lives if someone destroys our family.Did Betty have other options. Sure she did.  She was no saint either.  Millions of women take the blow Betty suffered, and many of them even recover to some extent.  Some even come back stronger.  That still doesn't make what happened to them, or to Betty, right.  As wrong as it was for her to murder, it was equally wrong that she was allowed to be driven to that extreme. Wrong for her, her children, and even wrong for Dan and Linda. Linda took what she wanted, Dan took what he wanted, and finally, Betty took what was left.  Not a pretty story, and not pretty people, whom a little character all around might have saved.",3,"entertaining, if inaccurate",1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,5100,"['movie', 'four', 'five', 'stars',

367947,A27NTH2Y9DAR31,6303274420,Schuyler V. Johnson,"[7, 8]","Men are horrifed and blame BB entirely; women have quite a different opinion. Meredith Baxter is sensational, as is Stephen Collins (this is the second movie Collins portrays a husband murdered in cold blood by his wife; the other was Nick Dunne's excellent book turned movie ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"", the true story of the Woodward family...and even sadder, both children of the couple committed suicide, one on Mother's Day) and it is like watching a train wreck; you can't turn away and you hope maybe this time they will wake up and escape and Betty will recover, but it is not to be.DB did everything wrong; he, of all people, knew BB and how deeply she was affected by the loss of her children, her husband and her entire lifestyle; usurped by a young, thoughtless girl who took delight in sending her ads for wrinkle cream and weight loss products,I also read in one book that Kolkena was a bit of a monster toward the children. Neither Dan nor Linda behaved in a way that was wise or sensible; they seemed to deliberately go out of their way to inflame and harass Betty who was already way over the edge; taunting someone already in deep rage and depression is simply not a good idea.I in NO WAY condone the murder of two people; (I would have much preferred Betty to win by legal means, but it was just not in the stars.) but I absolutely understand WHY she did it. I am also not surprised to notice that the overwhelming majority of those sympathetic to BB are women and those who vilify her are men; it is common and acceptable, even admirable, for men to abandon their wives for younger women; it happens more than we like to think.Baxter said she was more on BB's side in the first picture; much less in the second.

Based on a true story, fast paced and culminating in murder . . .guilty pleasure, for sure.  Meredith Baxter turns in a coldly calculating performance as Betty Broderick, rightly being nominated for an Emmy.  She couldn't be further away from Elyse Keaton of her ""Family Ties"" days.  The story is simply too fantastic to be fictional and the viewer very quickly becomes invested in the story.So what could be wrong with it?  Accuracy.  Dan Broderick is portrayed almost a saint, married to an unbelievable she-devil, who turns to his young assistant Linda for companionship and a romance eventually blossoms once Dan and Betty are divorced.  Read any book, or do any research on the case, and you will see where the bias from the Broderick family participation comes in.  Dan Broderick was hardly an angel, as was his second wife Linda, and they had an ongoing affair for more than three years, before Dan ever left Betty.  It certainly does not justify their murder, but it taints the accuracy of an otherwise impeccable story.Definitely a tele-movie worth viewing.

Dan still had a full head of hair in middle-age, and was really handsome and photogenic. Collins just didn't project Dan's charisma on-screen.Michelle Johnson, while attractive, is not the stunner that Linda Kolkena (supposedly) was. Linda was so beautiful that she turned heads and, reportedly, had a gorgeous smile. Johnson is merely ""cute"" here and is definitely no competition for Baxter in the looks department. This is important because, in real-life, Linda was ALL about her looks. It was all she had going for her.So, watch the DVD for Meredith Baxter's performance.
