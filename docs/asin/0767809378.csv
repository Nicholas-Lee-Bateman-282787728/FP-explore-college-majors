The story  centers around Deede, played to the hilt by Christina Ricci, who runs away  from home to live with her gay brother, Martin Donovan, and his companion.  What transpires is a series of comic antics that end up ruining her  brothers teaching career, his partnership and almost his sanity.  Lisa  Kudrow lends a very comedic hand as the sister to the brothers late dear  departed.  While much of the film is mean-spirited, it is never the less  entertaining to watch.

Lisa Kurdow is anoher with great potential. I know that for a  fact. Friends is a great, well thought out show And her perfonmance in Romy  and Michelles high School Reunion was funny as can be.

9848,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,0767809378,Alistair McHarg,"[4, 4]","The Opposite of Sex, (a Christina Ricci showcase), pulls off an almost impossible trick - it's a gleefully irreverent piece of political incorrectness that is never mean-spirited - indeed, as much as it would pain Dede, (the Ricci character), to admit it, the movie has heart.  This is a solid film that holds up very nicely under repeated viewings.Much has been made of Dede's narration, (more of an anti-narration), and the way it lampoons film conventions, traditional plot points, and viewer expectations.  She's saucy, fun, and outrageous - the kind of smart mouth teenager who's not nearly as tough and savvy as she wants you to believe.  But the real hero of this picture is writer, and novice director, Don Roos.  With a lead as flamboyant as Dede it must surely have been tempting to go for the broad laugh, instead, Roos took the high road.Listen carefully to the dialogue in this film, especially anytime Lucia, Lisa Kudrow, is speaking.  Kudrow gives the performance of a lifetime - perfect - but with scripting that smart and well turned it's hard to go wrong.  In Dede you have cynicism that wants to be cool, in Lucia you have genuine misery born of a feeling that everyone but you was invited to a party.This film looks at the meaning of being gay from every imaginable angle.  At one end are Dede's stereotypes of why real estate agents prefer selling the homes of gay men; at the other is the memorable scene between Bill, (Dede's half brother), and the preposterous Johnny, (Jason Block).  Bill, normally thoughtful and quiet, has found an aggressive way to command Johnny's attention, (Johnny is defaming and extorting him).  Bill's short, passionate speech detailing what he has had to endure as a gay man in order to make way for a next generation of ungrateful gay men like Johnny is hilarious, sad, and powerful; quite an accomplishment.Comedy is hard, dark comedy is harder still.

Minutella ""mystery buff""","[10, 12]","""The Opposite of Sex"" has the reputation for not being for all tastes, which is unfortunate, since this should be required viewing for those with an open mind and an open heart. This is an endlessly clever and well acted comedy that portrays the lives of characters that have flaws, that make mistakes, who judge and criticize, often prematurely, in an effort to find true happiness...just like many real people do. And as many noted, the unquestionable highlights are the stunning performances from both Christina Ricci and Lisa Kudrow. Ricci has simply never been better...her sharp commentary is both wickedly clever and amazingly incisive. Kudrow has perhaps the best role of her career as the acid-tongued Lucia, and one can't help but empathize with her despite her sharp witted barbs. The most amazing feat of ""The Opposite of Sex"" is that despite all the characters' shortcomings, we become so deeply involved in their plight that the ending becomes unexpectedly heatrfelt and moving, but in the least traditional or sappy way imaginable.

9850,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,0767809378,Andy Orrock,"[2, 5]","It's saying something about a movie when a friend asks you for a recommendation in 2004, and 1998's ""The Opposite of Sex"" is one of the first things that pops into your head.  Christina Ricci - in her first real adult role - rips the paint of the walls with her performance as Dede Truitt, a one-woman hurricane.  She wreaks havoc here in everyone else's life, starting with half-brother Bill, played by the always excellent Martin Donovan (see, among others, ""Insomnia,"" in which he plays Al Pacino's doomed partner).In fact, for all the attention garnered by what was essentially Ms. Ricci's very successful coming out party, the real news here are the excellent turns by Donovan, Lisa Kudrow (playing about as far from Phoebe as one can get) and Lyle Lovett.  Mr. Lovett proves her that he doesn't need Robert Altman to transfer his charisma from his musical performances to film.  [He had been essentially an Altman 'house player' up to this point in his career.]The script is sharp and witty.  We've got Don Roos (as writer and director) to thank for that.  I'm a little perplexed by Mr. Roos' career since that point - 'Bounce' (a disappointing Affleck/Paltrow outing) came out in 2000.  He did have a critical hit with 2000's TV summer replacement 'M.Y.O.B.'Roos has proven himself to be a great writer who attracts quality stars and directs them to impressive performances.  He does have 'Happy Endings' in production right now with Ms. Kudrow and other talented actors.

9852,A9XYVIKIN0IMK,0767809378,"aurileo ""aurileo""","[8, 21]","""The Opposite Of Sex"" is a very strange movie.  It tries a little too hard to be hip and ""edgy"" - mainly by having a protagonist, Dedee (played well by Christina Ricci), who's not only not a nice person, but who also tells the audience as much in the many voice-overs she does throughout the course of the movie.  The problem is, the voice-overs seem to be there to keep Ricci's presence in the viewer's mind, since she's actually in very little of the movie as a visible character.  There is lots of screen time given to Dedee's half-brother Bill, very well underplayed by Martin Donovan; and way too much screen time given to Lucia, the sister of Bill's now deceased boyfriend, played by Lisa Kudrow in a grating, one-note performance that has been inexplicably praised to the skies -- Some people thought she was ""robbed"" of an Oscar nomination for this movie, which I find laughable.  Her character here is in a bad mood almost all the time, making caustic (and unoriginal) comments about everyone, but Kudrow uses the same vocal and physical mannerisms as she does on ""Friends"" - the farthest away from Phoebe she gets is her mousy brown hair color.  She never gets Lucia to seem like a real person though.  To be fair, part of the blame must be laid at the feet of Don Roos, the writer/director: Lucia's motivations are never explained, and why she follows Bill around makes no sense except as part of a (possibly incestuous) obsession she had with her own brother -- if the script bothered to explore this aspect of her character it might have been more interesting, but as it is she might as well not be in the movie at all.  The same could be said for Lyle Lovett's policeman Carl (and the heavy-handedness of the dialogue right before Carl and Lucia kiss for the first time is painful).  Even the motivations of Dedee are vague - making a mess out of other people's lives only makes sense if Dedee is going to get something out of it herself, but what she's really after is never made clear, so although at the end of the movie she says she's changed, it seems lame and contrived - she's just smoked and drank her way through a pregnancy and snuck off leaving the baby with her half brother, so how exactly is she different?  And some of Dedee's un-PC observations (like her view of homosexuality and AIDS) are supposed to be knee-slappers, but instead they're just ... well, lame and contrived again, like a lot of the script.  Also problematic is that, between Dedee's voice-overs and Lucia's non-stop ranting about everything that's happening, the viewers are constantly being told what to think and feel about characters and situations, instead of just being allowed to experience the story as it unfolds and make up their own minds.There are some bright spots though.  I'm guessing that the writer/director is a (...)male himself, because the three principal gay male characters are the most authentic and best-written characters, and consequently the best-acted as well.  In addition to Donovan's strong performance (some complain that he is too low-key, but to me this makes sense for a character who's been paralyzed by grief), Ivan Sergei is terrific as Matt, the sweet but confused boy toy who is not quite as clueless as everyone thinks; and Johnny Galecki is hilarious as Jason, Matt's conniving and possessive ""other"" boyfriend who's a drama queen - some reviewers complained that Galecki's performance is over the top and stereotypical, but I thought he was realistic and also very funny.  It seems to me that Roos could have told a more effective story by concentrating on these three characters and fleshing them out more - giving so much importance to Dedee and especially to Lucia, serves mainly to muddy everything up, IMO.  Another plus for the movie is that it looks great - the cinematographer did a remarkable job. One caveat about the DVD though - the disc features a full screen transfer of the film on one side and a ""widescreen"" transfer on the other; however the widescreen version, while it does give a bit more picture on the left and right sides, seems to have cut off some of the top and bottom of the frame as well.  So what's the point?Although it thinks it's more profound than it really is, ""The Opposite Of Sex"" is not a bad movie, but it won't be everyone's cup of tea, so I would recommend renting it before buying it.",3,Not bad but overrated,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,4367,"['Opposite', 'Sex', 'very', 'strange', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'hip', 'edgy', 'mainly', 'having', 'protagonist', 'Dedee', 'played', 'well', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'nice', 'person', 'who', 'also', 'audience', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'voice-overs', 'course', 'movie', 'problem', 'voice-overs', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'keep', 'Ricci', 'presence', 'viewer', 'mind', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'movie', 'visible', 'character', 'lots', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'Dedee', 'half-brother', 'Bill', 'very', 'well', 'underplayed', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'Lucia', 'sister', 'Bill', 'now', 'deceased', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'grating', 'one-note', 'performance', 'been', 'inexplicably', 'praised', 'skies', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'robbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'movie', 'find', 'laughable', 'character', 'here', 'bad', 'mood', 'almost', 'time', 'making', 'caustic', 'unoriginal', 'comments', 'everyone', 'Kudrow', 'same', 'vocal', 'physical', 'mannerisms', 'Friends', 'farthest', 'away', 'Phoebe', 'mousy', 'brown', 'hair', 'color', 'never', 'Lucia', 'seem', 'real', 'person', 'be', 'fair', 'part', 'blame', 'must', 'be', 'laid', 'feet', 'Don', 'Roos', 'writer/director', 'Lucia', 'motivations', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'why', 'Bill', 'sense', 'part', 'possibly', 'incestuous', 'obsession', 'had', 'own', 'brother', 'script', 'bothered', 'explore', 'aspect', 'character', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Lyle', 'Lovett', 'policeman', 'Carl', 'heavy-handedness', 'dialogue', 'right', 'Carl', 'Lucia', 'kiss', 'first', 'time', 'painful', 'Even', 'motivations', 'Dedee', 'are', 'vague', 'making', 'mess', 'other', 'people', 'lives', 'only', 'sense', 'Dedee', 'going', 'get', 'something', 'what', 'really', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'so', 'end', 'movie', 'changed', 'lame', 'contrived', 'just', 'smoked', 'drank', 'way', 'pregnancy', 'snuck', 'off', 'leaving', 'baby', 'half', 'brother', 'how', 'exactly', 'different', 'Dedee', 'un-PC', 'observations', 'view', 'homosexuality', 'AIDS', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'knee-slappers', 'instead', ""'re"", 'just', 'well', 'lame', 'contrived', 'again', 'lot', 'script', 'Also', 'problematic', 'Dedee', 'voice-overs', 'Lucia', 'non-stop', 'ranting', 'everything', 'happening', 'viewers', 'are', 'constantly', 'being', 'told', 'what', 'think', 'feel', 'characters', 'situations', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'allowed', 'experience', 'story', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds.There', 'are', 'bright', 'spots', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'writer/director', 'male', 'three', 'principal', 'gay', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'authentic', 'best-written', 'characters', 'consequently', 'best-acted', 'well', 'addition', 'Donovan', 'strong', 'performance', 'complain', 'too', 'low-key', 'sense', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'paralyzed', 'grief', 'Ivan', 'Sergei', 'terrific', 'Matt', 'sweet', 'confused', 'boy', 'toy', 'who', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'clueless', 'everyone', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'hilarious', 'Jason', 'Matt', 'conniving', 'possessive', 'other', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'drama', 'queen', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'Galecki', 'performance', 'top', 'stereotypical', 'thought', 'was', 'realistic', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'Roos', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'more', 'effective', 'story', 'concentrating', 'three', 'characters', 'fleshing', 'out', 'more', 'giving', 'so', 'much', 'importance', 'Dedee', 'especially', 'Lucia', 'mainly', 'muddy', 'everything', 'up', 'IMO', 'plus', 'movie', 'great', 'cinematographer', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'One', 'caveat', 'DVD', 'disc', 'full', 'screen', 'transfer', 'film', 'one', 'side', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'other', 'however', 'widescreen', 'version', 'give', 'bit', 'more', 'picture', 'left', 'right', 'sides', 'have', 'cut', 'off', 'top', 'bottom', 'frame', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'point', 'more', 'profound', 'really', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'would', 'recommend', 'renting', 'buying']",N/A

Usually I don't add reviews to a film with an existing body of comments, feeling I have little to add to what others have already said, but in this case I'm making an exception.One actor commented in another review that the performances come across as a cold read. While I agree with that opinion of some of the performances, acting is not my forte. I'm a writer and my appreciation of this film is for the wonderful script. If you like your comedy dark and uncompromising, (think Heathers) then you will enjoy some of the crackling and sarcastic dialogue waiting for you in this story.The plot itself isn't designed to bring compelling comparisons to Citizen Kane. The characters are ignorant, easily manipulated, individuals. Contented and in some cases arrogantly complacent people have their lives turned upside down by the arrival of a trailer-trash backwater tramp. It's a common enough contrivance to twist the ""fish out of water"" plot, but Ricci plays her part as one who is better prepared for her new environment than those that already call it home. Her performance is a tour de force and this film was the exact transitional point in her career that allowed her to move from the ""goth child"" whimsy of her early films into the sexier and more adult fare she tends to favor today. Her acting is actually a cut above what she delivers in films like Monster, where she at times seemed almost in awe of her costar. Here she takes center stage and the only real competitor in sight is Lisa Kudrow, who gives an uneven but wickedly sharp-tongued turn.An example of the dialogue I referenced earlier is provided by Kudrow in fact. Early in the film, Ricci announces she has become pregnant by her brother's gay lover. Kudrow turns to the brother and says, ""I thought you were gay!"" He informs her that he is bisexual and without missing a beat Kudrow retorts, ""Oh PLEASE! I went to a Bar Mitzvah once and it didn't make me Jewish!"" Her delivery of this line is full of such venom that half of the audience I saw it with was deeply offended while the other half, myself included, burst out in loud and approving laughter.Such is the nature of black comedy. It walks the fine line between offense and hysteria. When it misses the mark, as is often the case in lesser scripts, the entire film suffers. When it finds the balance it delights as many people as it offends. Such is the case with The Opposite of Sex. The majority of reviewers here have adored the crisp dialogue, and a vocal minority found themselves offended or lost.Amazon recently dropped the price of this movie and while the older $20 price tag may have made it a risky choice for someone who hasn't already seen the film, at the new lower cost it's worth every penny to give this movie the chance it deserves. If nothing else, it's a chance to watch a young talent make the successful transition into adult-flavored roles that have eluded so many other child actors and actresses.",5,Wickedly evil dialogue fills this movie,1256860800,"10 30, 2009",2009,3105,"[""'m"", 'long-time', 'fan', 'film', 'finally', 'took', 'time', 'read', 'reviews', 'comments', 'already', 'here', 'Amazon', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'others', 'thought', 'Usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'reviews', 'film', 'existing', 'body', 'comments', 'feeling', 'have', 'little', 'add', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'case', ""'m"", 'making', 'exception.One', 'actor', 'commented', 'review', 'performances', 'come', 'cold', 'read', 'agree', 'opinion', 'performances', 'acting', 'not', 'forte', ""'m"", 'writer', 'appreciation', 'film', 'wonderful', 'script', 'like', 'comedy', 'dark', 'uncompromising', 'think', 'Heathers', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'crackling', 'sarcastic', 'dialogue', 'waiting', 'story.The', 'plot', ""n't"", 'designed', 'bring', 'compelling', 'comparisons', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'characters', 'are', 'ignorant', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'individuals', 'Contented', 'cases', 'arrogantly', 'complacent', 'people', 'have', 'lives', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'arrival', 'trailer-trash', 'backwater', 'tramp', 'common', 'enough', 'contrivance', 'twist', 'fish', 'water', 'plot', 'Ricci', 'part', 'one', 'who', 'better', 'prepared', 'new', 'environment', 'already', 'call', 'home', 'performance', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'film', 'was', 'exact', 'transitional', 'point', 'career', 'allowed', 'move', 'goth', 'child', 'whimsy', 'early', 'films', 'sexier', 'more', 'adult', 'fare', 'favor', 'today', 'acting', 'actually', 'cut', 'what', 'films', 'Monster', 'where', 'times', 'seemed', 'almost', 'awe', 'costar', 'Here', 'center', 'stage', 'only', 'real', 'competitor', 'sight', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'who', 'uneven', 'wickedly', 'sharp-tongued', 'turn.An', 'example', 'dialogue', 'referenced', 'earlier', 'provided', 'Kudrow', 'fact', 'Early', 'film', 'Ricci', 'become', 'pregnant', 'brother', 'gay', 'lover', 'Kudrow', 'brother', 'thought', 'were', 'gay', 'bisexual', 'missing', 'beat', 'Kudrow', 'Oh', 'PLEASE', 'went', 'Bar', 'Mitzvah', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Jewish', 'delivery', 'line', 'full', 'such', 'venom', 'half', 'audience', 'saw', 'was', 'deeply', 'offended', 'other', 'half', 'included', 'burst', 'out', 'loud', 'approving', 'laughter.Such', 'nature', 'black', 'comedy', 'fine', 'line', 'offense', 'hysteria', 'When', 'mark', 'often', 'case', 'lesser', 'scripts', 'entire', 'film', 'suffers', 'When', 'balance', 'delights', 'many', 'people', 'Such', 'case', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'majority', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'adored', 'crisp', 'dialogue', 'vocal', 'minority', 'found', 'offended', 'lost.Amazon', 'recently', 'dropped', 'price', 'movie', 'older', '20', 'price', 'tag', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'risky', 'choice', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'new', 'lower', 'cost', 'worth', 'penny', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'nothing', 'else', 'chance', 'watch', 'young', 'talent', 'make', 'successful', 'transition', 'adult-flavored', 'roles', 'have', 'eluded', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'child', 'actors', 'actresses']",N/A

9861,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,0767809378,Busy Body,"[2, 9]","OK, first off, this review will focus on the film - not the quality of the DVD. People have reviewed this film giving it 1 Star just because of lack of extra DVD footage, poor quality etc. You're not here to review the DVD content, but to focus on the film. So in the future, please don't focus on the DVD extras, but the quality of the film. The Opposite Of Sex has to be one of the best films of the 90's. This is a scathing, dark comedy best suited for people who enjoy films that shock you and are very truthful about the society we live in. Director Don Roos does an excellent job by sparing nothing and no one. The Opposite Of Sex didn't exactly set the Box Office alight, but its distinctive tone will stay with us for years as one of the best films in quite a while.Christina Ricci plays DeeDee Truitt. This acid-tounged, self-centered and rude teenager makes the biggest impact on the film and she also narrates the movie. This makes us see everything from her viewpoint. She comes from Louisiana, claiming to have been molested by her step-father. But because of her self-centered character, we are never sure if this is true. She goes to visit her gay half-brother, Bill, who lives in the Midwest and is a school teacher. She seduces his boyfriend, Matt. She makes him believe he's the father to her child. Not the brightest star in the night sky, he believes everything she says and leaves his boyfriend for her (he's bisexual). Lisa Kudrow stars as Lucia. She is Bill's best friend and fancies him. They both say goodbye to DeeDee and Matt. There's trouble ahead when Matt's other boyfriend, played by Jonny Galecki, demands to know where he is. Bill doesn't know where he is, so he cannot tell him. With this, Matt's other boyfriend claims that Bill tried to seduce him when he was a student at the same high school Bill teaches at.After that, you're probably left thinking that you wouldn't watch The Opposite Of Sex if it was the last movie on the Earth. But this is a film that you HAVE to see. The acting is absolutely superb and first-rate. Christina Ricci makes a convincing change from her role as Wednesday eight years previously in The Addams Family. While Lisa Kudrow is brilliant too. She also makes a convincing case from the dizzy Phoebe in Friends to an intelligent, yet wacky, Lucia. The film moves at a fast pace to keep you shocked and entertained. But I would say the film is at its best when Christina Ricci narrates the story, keeping you up to date. At the beginning, she tells us, ""I always carry a gun. You should always remember that. If you're smart, you will"". This challanges the audience into thinking they can compete with her. Yet you do actually forget she keeps a gun on her at all times because you're so focused on the film. Another sign on great narration is when she is giving birth to her first child. She says, ""OK, enough of that"". The screen is split in two. ""Here's the rest,"" she says. The left hand of the screen continues the story, as the right hand focuses on a mute version of DeeDee giving birth - amazing and expertly done.This film may not be the biggest hit ever, but at least it deals with real-life issues and is frank and truthful in the telling - something you don't see in pathetic action flicks such as The Mummy or Spiderman. The Opposite Of Sex is a film you will either love or hate because it's full of sex and swearing.

The Opposite of Sex is anything but.  There are a couple of reasons why.1) The characters are actually interesting!  The protagonist is not a likeable character.  Why is it that Hollywood  feels the need to consistently feed us vanilla characters who are heroes  and sympathetic characters?  This film breaks that trend--Dedee is a  wonderfully malicious, if not completely evil, immoral, and obscene  character.  Her maneuverings and dialogue are so much fun to see--both for  her biting humor and the reactions the other characters have to her.  Christina Ricci (as DeDee) obviously had a great deal of fun in playing the  role, and her energy is contagious.Though not as vivid, the other  characters are very interesting as well.  Any fan of Friends and Lisa  Kudrow should see this film just to see her in a non-ditsy role.  Her  character of Lucia, like all of the characters (perhaps save for Lyle  Lovett's Carl), are written and played with a great deal of depth and  style.  None are entirely likeable, but in real life, who ever is?2) I  have not seen a film in a long time that weaves such a complicated  humorously soap-operatic storyline with such effortless grace.  In the end,  all of the characters interrelationships make sense to YOU, but don't try  to explain them to someone who hasn't seen the film--you won't be able  to!The DVD is packed with features as well.  The directors' commentary  is very good, for those aspiring filmmakers out there.  The deleted scenes  were cool as well, especially as they also included director's commentary.

The movie is smart, entertaining, and funny; the cast is perfect. It's really a quality movie. Ricci plays the 16-year old Dedee Truitt, who lives with her mother whom she can't stand and her stepfather who has just passed away. In a act of rebellion, she moves in with her half-brother Bill Truitt (Donovan), a homosexual school teacher. Dedee is a character we've seen in plenty of movies; she's deceitful, a liar, cold, and devilishly smart. Anyway, Dedee seduces Bill's boyfriend Matt (Ivan Sergei) and then announces that she's pregnant. Leaving Bill hearbroken, Matt and Dedee move to Los Angeles and Bill continues living his life. But then a former student of Bill's looking for Matt accuses Bill of molesting him in school, when Bill will not reveal Matt's whereabouts. With his reputation ruined, his former-dead-lover's sister Lucia (Kudrow), who's clearly in love with Bill heads to L.A. with Bill to track down both Dedee and Matt. But things don't go down that easy. Christina Ricci is a talented actress, she can play any character she wants to. Nice girl, naughty girl, or downright mean girl. I think the latter is what she plays best and she's in top form here. The thing I thought was interesting was that I was more interested in the story between Bill and Lucia then I was with Ricci's character though. Since her character would disappear for long intervals (although, Ricci narrates the movie), I noticed I was more entertained without her. Anyway, it's a flawed film definitely but I enjoyed it a lot. It's witty and makes quite a few good points about a lot of different subjects.GRADE: A-",5,Opposite of Sex,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,1928,"['Don', 'Roos', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Buffalo', ""'66"", 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Friends', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'Lyle', 'Lovett', 'dude', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'almost', 'subject', 'having', 'do', 'sex', 'including', 'AIDs', 'homosexuality', 'relationships', 'why', 'like', 'sex', 'name', 'movie', 'smart', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'cast', 'perfect', 'really', 'quality', 'movie', 'Ricci', '16-year', 'old', 'Dedee', 'Truitt', 'who', 'mother', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'stepfather', 'who', 'just', 'passed', 'away', 'act', 'rebellion', 'half-brother', 'Bill', 'Truitt', 'Donovan', 'homosexual', 'school', 'teacher', 'Dedee', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'movies', 'deceitful', 'liar', 'cold', 'devilishly', 'smart', 'Anyway', 'Dedee', 'Bill', 'boyfriend', 'Matt', 'Ivan', 'Sergei', 'then', 'announces', 'pregnant', 'Leaving', 'Bill', 'hearbroken', 'Matt', 'Dedee', 'move', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Bill', 'living', 'life', 'then', 'former', 'student', 'Bill', 'looking', 'Matt', 'Bill', 'molesting', 'school', 'when', 'Bill', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'Matt', 'whereabouts', 'reputation', 'ruined', 'former-dead-lover', 'sister', 'Lucia', 'Kudrow', 'who', 'clearly', 'love', 'Bill', 'heads', 'L.A.', 'Bill', 'track', 'down', 'Dedee', 'Matt', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'easy', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'talented', 'actress', 'can', 'play', 'character', 'Nice', 'girl', 'naughty', 'girl', 'downright', 'mean', 'girl', 'think', 'latter', 'what', 'best', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'story', 'Bill', 'Lucia', 'then', 'was', 'Ricci', 'character', 'character', 'would', 'disappear', 'long', 'intervals', 'Ricci', 'movie', 'noticed', 'was', 'more', 'entertained', 'Anyway', 'flawed', 'film', 'definitely', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'witty', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'points', 'lot', 'different', 'subjects.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

9877,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767809378,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","There were fewer than usual alternative movies released in 1998, but The Opposite of Sex makes up for half a dozen of them. It is a scathing dark comedy, best suited for people who enjoy seeing a film that writes its own formula.Nothing and no one is spared by director and writer Don Roos, yet he still fills the story with a number of redeeming values. This is social satire rather than the nihilistic raving of a disillusioned Generation-Xer. While not destined to be seen by that many viewers, it is still a work that will be remembered long after the year's expensive formula fluff is forgotten.Roos certainly does not hesitate to take chances. Not only is the main character Deedee [Christina Ricci] one of the rudest, self-centered teenage characters ever seen, she also narrates the movie. This means we see everything from this pathetic creature's view point. Roos and Ricci, who's come quite a distance from her days as Wednesday in The Addams Family movies, pull it off. Yes, Deedee is a dreadful young woman, but we start to see that this is all mostly a defense mechanism against a world she views as heartless and unfair. We all know people like this. They strike out furiously before the world can strike back at them.Young Deedee leaves her rural Louisiana town, claiming later to have been molested by her stepfather. Like most of her stories, we never know for sure if this is true or not. She goes to visit her school teacher half-brother in the Midwest and promptly steals his boyfriend Matt, played with comic assurance by Ivan Sergei. Not terribly bright, he leaves town with Deedee, who's convinced him he's the father of her forthcoming child.Her brother Bill [Martin Donovan] and his best friend Lucia [Lisa Kudrow], who has the hots for HIM, say good riddance. When Matt's other boyfriend [Johnny Galecki] shows up demanding to know where he is, Bill can't tell him because he doesn't have a clue. The lad follows through on his threat to claim Bill seduced him when he was his student at the local high school.That should be enough about the plot to convince some people they wouldn't watch this if it were the last video on earth and to show others that, since this is obviously not a normal movie, they will have to see it.The acting is first rate. All of the principles are people who seem to have decided at some point that it's better to be a real actor in a small, independent movie than to be a prop in a large one. They came to this project with a number of off beat films to their credit. Even Kudrow of Friends fame makes small pictures during her vacations from the series.The story, of course, travels an improbably road. Roos keeps it fast moving, shocking and funny. Traps are laid by Deedee, the totally manipulative narrator. Things we expect to happen don't, and vice versa. The writer-director is great at making up characters. I suspect that his unflinching portrait of a trailer trash girl from Louisiana is based on some people he's known in his life. Like it or not, she's far from being a caricature.

9878,ANXXESN6USU1H,0767809378,M. Burns,"[0, 0]","Although Christina Ricci got most of the attention for acting in this film, the rest of the cast gave equally superb performances: Martin Donovan, the untrumpeted lead; Lisa Kudrow, his jaded, acerbic sidekick; and even the subtly effacing Lyle Lovett.Lovett, as Carl the cop, seems to have the innate modesty of self-perception necessary for portraying a sympathetic character, so that he grows on you as he does on Kudrow, his object of affection. Loneliness seems to follow him like a dust cloud; Carl's steadfast determination to trump fate wins her, and us, over.But Donovan is the steady rock of the film, the long-distance runner whose acquired patience and wisdom, necessary in being a successful male high-school teacher, carry the story and its characters to a better destiny. Despite his friends' and relations' seemingly intractable frailties (especially on the part of the diabolical Ms. Ricci), Donovan's understated manner, self-control, and maturity help them unwittingly succumb to age and sensibility in becoming happier and more fulfilled people.The film explores and implodes various truths, half-truths, myths and misconceptions about sex and relationships such that your senses are constantly titillated, though never overwhelmed or annoyed.  Ricci's cynical narration is tempered by Kudrow's tart though sometimes heartwarming observations, Donovan's acceptance and forgiveness, and Lovett's frail decency, traits honed by the pain of experience and loss.Although the cast is small, there are enough interrelationships, and incisive, often hilarious, dialogue, to maintain a brisk pace. Donovan, for example, tolerates and is mildly amused by Kudrow's obsession with human imperfection (underscored by her futile attraction to Donovan), while seemingly having nothing in common with her, except the loss of her brother, who was his lover. (If it hadn't already been taken, this film could alternately have been titled ""Shampoo"".)Excellent screenplay, casting, direction and delivery.  Woody Allen without the self-indulgence and sexual immaturity.

Christina Ricci is an absolute dream in this, and Lisa Kudrow is about as far removed from her Phoebe character as you could possibly get. I wasn't so keen on Martin Donovan's character, Bill, so much. He was very emotionless.It's very fast-paced, with a very sarcastic narrative from Christina's character, which isn't intrusive, and fills you in on stuff you might not have noticed/obvious stuff/stuff that isn't necessary to show in the movie, but needs to be mentioned. It is highly amusing, witty and provides the audience with a release during tense and heavily themed situations. Christina's narrative is quite funny at times, as she comments on her own comments and on the movie itself, and most of the jokes come from her spoken lines. The film is suitably gritty and very well acted. Every character (apart from Bill) is suitably addictive to watch, which you want to know about DeeDee and her life. She smokes, she drinks, she pinches her nipples so they show through her top. A girl we'd all want to be.The director has the audience in the palm of their hand when at one point during the movie, it shows how easily we can be manipulated by mood and music as well as the points that we show in a character's life.This movie comes highly recommended, and a must-have for your collection of DVDs.

Yet, in some way I am yet to verbalize, you land up liking  her (kind of). Martin Donovan as her set-upon half-brother is probably  every gay man's (and probably a few straight women's) dream and Ricci's  scathing narration concerning him makes him even more so. It is a brilliant  performance.

This film moves you, makes you laugh, think, and truly has you wanting to reach into your television to strangle some if not everyone. Christina Ricci ""She's the human tabloid."" is all attitude and no graduate as DeeDee Truitt a 16 year old girl that refuses to grow a heart of gold even for us the veiwers. Thats cool we see that type of stuff everyday in the movies. After her stepfather kicks the bucket she decides to go and live with her brother. He, who is moaring his lovers death welcomes her. One might say that was a huge mistake on his part. She does little more than ruin his teaching career, steal his new boyfriend, gets him involved in a gay sex scandal involving a former student where he teaches (thus, the reason for his almost termination), okay what else... steals his dead lovers urn containing the mans ashes. Oh and thats just the half of it. Let's finish this... ""The Oppisite of sex"" is what DeeDee wants. SEX involves relationships, deceases, pregnanies and other complications in ones life. Who want's that? The film also addresses the survival of the species topic. It's true if we didn't love sex (complications aside) we would have died out aeons ago. Good move on God's part.

The set-up has Deedee (Ricci) as narrator, pregnant and landing herself on the doorstep of her half-brother Bill's only to seduce his boyfriend, convince him the baby's his and to swipe a load of Bill's cash and set him up with a sex scandal at the school he works for.  Things quickly become more tangled as the real father of the child turns up and the sister of Bill's dead ex, Lucia (Kudrow) tags along for the ride.Right from the get go you know you've got a whiz of a narrator in Ricci, this being perhaps her best role to date, as Deedee quickly informs us that she hasn't got a heart of gold and she doesn't grow one later.  She ruins other people's lives and basically doesn't give a damn about them.  Her dry and sardonic tone is perfect for all those moments where you think the plot will sink into clich&eacute;d territory.  In addition this sets Christina Ricci out as one of the actresses of her generation (along with Kirsten Dunst), someone capable of playing diverse roles but always with a glimmering quality.  It's her more than anything else that makes this movie worth watching in fact, and it's a shame that we see less of her after she escapes with Bill's money.Although this is mostly just a conventional movie with a bit of bite, that edge does give it something else.  The main flaw of the movie is that if it sets itself out as being unconventional it goes back on itself countless times.  Still, there's something to be said for a movie that doesn't try and make you like its characters at all, many of whom are self-seeking, selfish or foolish, mostly all at the same time.

""I hate people who talk during movies, but if she were sitting behind me in the theater, saying all of this stuff, I'd want her to keep right on talking"".On the surface, ""The Opposite of Sex"" has the standard love story movie elements with characters engaged in the process of discovery and revelation. But below the surface the voice-over is providing a sort of sexual teasing to the audience (and it is not the opposite of sex). There is an ongoing shifting out of the movie each time Ricci shifts out of her character to discuss the film and its elements; doing this from a detached perspective, a technique that she is especially effective at. This bonds us to her character more completely than a simple narration or point-of-view. After a little of this, when her character interacts with characters inside the film our identification process as viewers intensifies.Then again, what do I know?

Yes, he's over-the-top and, yes, Hollywood needs to make films with gay men that are less stereotypical.
