916529,A3GLX47PF4ZN9T,B0009Y25ZU,Alex,"[1, 1]","If you like movies that make you want to stab its actors in the eardrums so they'll be forced to communicate solely through Facebook chat, because it's all they're fit to do, you might enjoy this movie like I did.Marnie's an interesting character. Her ubernerd friend Mitchell says ""she's an amazing person,"" and it's true. She's nice, funny, unassuming, and fun. So why does she have trouble finding a guy? I've narrowed it down to two reasons: 1. Every guy in her social circle is either a fooshbag or a social fooshtard, and most are both. 2. She is a social fooshtard. When she talks to crush Alex about their relationship, she closes off like a scared valve, and is unable to emit a single mote of feeling.Speaking of - Alex is an interesting character. He's also a fooshbag. Marnie likes Alex because he's one of the few humans she knows who can hold up his end of a conversation. Despite this, Alex can be dismissive, marginally mean, and generally handles his relationship with Marnie like a poophead.This movie is about really awkward people who suck at getting what they want and expressing themselves. I don't buy the idea that these people are everymen; though we've all had awkward moments, I couldn't relate to the level of awkwardness here at all. In fact, if I had to live through the level of awkwardness and anxiety present in this movie, I would definitely shoot myself in the eardrum. But here's a whole community of these people. How do they do it??This could have easily been too grating to watch, but Bujalewski did a really good job of 'making it real', and communicating the desperate importance of its unfolding events for its characters. As Marnie found out about her crush's breakup, got a new job, drank at parties and interacted with people, I was completely absorbed in all of it.I think I rate movies by their power of engagement. As I get old I find it harder to be engaged in movies. This movie was very engaging.",5,This is a good movie I liked,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,1947,"['like', 'movies', 'make', 'want', 'stab', 'actors', 'eardrums', ""'ll"", 'be', 'forced', 'communicate', 'solely', 'Facebook', 'chat', ""'re"", 'fit', 'do', 'might', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'did.Marnie', 'interesting', 'character', 'ubernerd', 'friend', 'Mitchell', 'amazing', 'person', 'true', 'nice', 'funny', 'unassuming', 'fun', 'So', 'why', 'have', 'trouble', 'finding', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'narrowed', 'down', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'guy', 'social', 'circle', 'fooshbag', 'social', 'fooshtard', 'most', 'are', '2', 'social', 'fooshtard', 'When', 'crush', 'Alex', 'relationship', 'scared', 'valve', 'unable', 'emit', 'single', 'mote', 'feeling.Speaking', 'Alex', 'interesting', 'character', 'also', 'fooshbag', 'Marnie', 'Alex', 'one', 'few', 'humans', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'up', 'end', 'conversation', 'Alex', 'can', 'be', 'dismissive', 'marginally', 'mean', 'generally', 'relationship', 'Marnie', 'poophead.This', 'movie', 'really', 'awkward', 'people', 'who', 'suck', 'getting', 'what', 'want', 'expressing', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'idea', 'people', 'are', 'everymen', ""'ve"", 'had', 'awkward', 'moments', 'could', ""n't"", 'relate', 'level', 'awkwardness', 'here', 'fact', 'had', 'live', 'level', 'awkwardness', 'anxiety', 'present', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'shoot', 'eardrum', 'here', 'whole', 'community', 'people', 'How', 'do', 'do', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'too', 'grating', 'watch', 'Bujalewski', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', ""'making"", 'real', 'communicating', 'desperate', 'importance', 'unfolding', 'events', 'characters', 'Marnie', 'found', 'out', 'crush', 'breakup', 'got', 'new', 'job', 'drank', 'parties', 'interacted', 'people', 'was', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'it.I', 'think', 'rate', 'movies', 'power', 'engagement', 'get', 'old', 'find', 'harder', 'be', 'engaged', 'movies', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'engaging']",Funny Ha Ha

916532,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0009Y25ZU,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[2, 4]","A lot of trendy critics are praising this film like it's the future of cinema (the press have dubbed films like this ""the mumblecore movement"").  While this film is not a complete disaster, it is not earth shattering.  In critics' cirlces, there has been comparisons to Cassavettes, Truffault, and the French New Wave!  These are incredibly misplaced and utterly ridiculous.  Ironically, having read a couple of interviews with the director of this film, he might agree that the press are overdoing it.  This is just a film about 20 somethings sitting around, talking, working, sleeping, eating, etc., etc..  The film is at best OK.  It starts out decently, has a nice cinema verite feel to it, but as it progresses, it becomes tedious and tired, as nothing really interesting or artistic ever happens.  Many have done the cinema verite route before (Fassbinder's Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? is a good example, along with some of Cassavettes's work), but just because the film is done in a realistic manner doesn't make the film a work of genius.  I think critics are so desperate at times to find a new ""movement"" that they elevate mediocre films like this to gold status.  Some might say that the point of the film was to show these people as they really are, but I was really bored by this.  Some will say ""you just didn't get it"".  Well, yes, I did, and it's not a good film at all.  Kate Dollenmayer is a pretty engaging actress, and some of the supporting players are good.  Technically, the film is average for an indie film, but the sound is horrible in some places.  When Kevin Smith shot Clerks (a much better film than this one), the sound was rough at times but it was consistent.  Sometimes the sound here is blaring, other times you can't understand one word. Aside from the technical problems, the film isn't particularly good, and it is not a masterpiece.",2,"It's OK, nothing more....",1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,1870,"['lot', 'trendy', 'critics', 'are', 'praising', 'film', 'future', 'cinema', 'press', 'have', 'dubbed', 'films', 'mumblecore', 'movement', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'disaster', 'not', 'earth', 'shattering', 'critics', 'cirlces', 'been', 'comparisons', 'Cassavettes', 'Truffault', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'are', 'incredibly', 'misplaced', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'Ironically', 'having', 'read', 'couple', 'interviews', 'director', 'film', 'might', 'agree', 'press', 'are', 'overdoing', 'just', 'film', '20', 'somethings', 'sitting', 'around', 'talking', 'working', 'sleeping', 'eating', 'etc.', 'etc..', 'film', 'best', 'OK', 'out', 'decently', 'nice', 'cinema', 'verite', 'feel', 'tedious', 'tired', 'nothing', 'really', 'interesting', 'artistic', 'ever', 'Many', 'have', 'done', 'cinema', 'verite', 'route', 'Fassbinder', 'Why', 'Does', 'Herr', 'R.', 'Run', 'Amok', 'good', 'example', 'Cassavettes', 'work', 'just', 'film', 'done', 'realistic', 'manner', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'work', 'genius', 'think', 'critics', 'are', 'so', 'desperate', 'times', 'find', 'new', 'movement', 'elevate', 'mediocre', 'films', 'gold', 'status', 'might', 'say', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'show', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'was', 'really', 'bored', 'will', 'say', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Well', 'yes', 'did', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'Kate', 'Dollenmayer', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'actress', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'good', 'Technically', 'film', 'average', 'indie', 'film', 'sound', 'horrible', 'places', 'When', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'shot', 'Clerks', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'one', 'sound', 'was', 'rough', 'times', 'was', 'consistent', 'Sometimes', 'sound', 'here', 'blaring', 'other', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'one', 'word', 'Aside', 'technical', 'problems', 'film', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'not', 'masterpiece']",Funny Ha Ha
916533,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0009Y25ZU,Kevin Killian,"[4, 6]","At the outset it's pretty crummy, but by the end of the film we were rooting for Marnie (Kate Dollenmeyer) to succeed with her program of bettering herself.  She's not a great actress, and sometimes she looks better than others, but you do keep watching.  At first, when she stumbles drunk into the tattoo parlor and asks for a Celtic cross, you're like ""Oh no,"" but little by little first time director Andrew Bujalski allows us a deeper access into her heart.  I liked the scene where she and Alex spot a girlfriend passed out at the steering wheel of her car, parked in front of Marnie's apartment, and Marnie drops everything, even the chance to lure Alex into her bed, just to help the poor drunk girl.  Thus charity trumps lust for once, and makes the rest of the picture easier to take, for we realize there's more to Marnie than just being the kind of girl every guy wants to kiss, but not to go out on a whole date with.Alex, the irresponsible boy, is well played by Christian Rudder.  Alex' longtime relationship with the va-va-voom Nina has reached a temporary excursus point when FUNNY HA HA begins, and he seems to be single, and when Matnie hears about this news indirectly from her pals Rachel and Dave, she can't help but linger a little too long at Alex's flame.  She knows he's wrong for her, but he's got her number in some white boy way, and she can't help herself.  The attentions of Mitchell, the gawky geek who temps with her the ""Intellitech,"" deflect her not a whit.The film slightly overdoes how Marnie is supposed to be a beauty, and Mitchell a nerd.  I just didn't believe this angle of the story, and it's easy to see that writer/director/editor Andrew Bujalski isn't very much into it, for he rewards himself with healthy close-ups that show, after all, he's a hot guy despite himself.  The actors can't really act, but all in all, FUNNY HA HA is considerably superior to SHADOWS, the Cassavetes film to which it has been frequently compared.Those awful T-shirts that Marnie wears are enough reason to dock this film a star however.",4,Docked for Some Truly Ugly T-Shirt Abuse,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,2062,"['outset', 'pretty', 'crummy', 'end', 'film', 'were', 'rooting', 'Marnie', 'Kate', 'Dollenmeyer', 'succeed', 'program', 'bettering', 'not', 'great', 'actress', 'sometimes', 'better', 'others', 'do', 'keep', 'watching', 'first', 'when', 'drunk', 'tattoo', 'parlor', 'Celtic', 'cross', ""'re"", 'Oh', 'little', 'little', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Bujalski', 'deeper', 'access', 'heart', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'Alex', 'spot', 'girlfriend', 'passed', 'out', 'steering', 'wheel', 'car', 'parked', 'front', 'Marnie', 'apartment', 'Marnie', 'drops', 'everything', 'even', 'chance', 'lure', 'Alex', 'bed', 'just', 'help', 'poor', 'drunk', 'girl', 'Thus', 'charity', 'trumps', 'lust', 'once', 'rest', 'picture', 'easier', 'take', 'realize', 'more', 'Marnie', 'just', 'being', 'kind', 'girl', 'guy', 'kiss', 'not', 'go', 'out', 'whole', 'date', 'with.Alex', 'irresponsible', 'boy', 'well', 'played', 'Christian', 'Rudder', 'Alex', 'longtime', 'relationship', 'va-va-voom', 'Nina', 'reached', 'temporary', 'excursus', 'point', 'when', 'FUNNY', 'HA', 'HA', 'be', 'single', 'when', 'Matnie', 'news', 'indirectly', 'pals', 'Rachel', 'Dave', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'linger', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'Alex', 'flame', 'wrong', 'got', 'number', 'white', 'boy', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'herself', 'attentions', 'Mitchell', 'gawky', 'geek', 'who', 'Intellitech', 'deflect', 'not', 'whit.The', 'film', 'slightly', 'how', 'Marnie', 'supposed', 'be', 'beauty', 'Mitchell', 'nerd', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'angle', 'story', 'easy', 'see', 'writer/director/editor', 'Andrew', 'Bujalski', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'healthy', 'close-ups', 'show', 'hot', 'guy', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'act', 'FUNNY', 'HA', 'HA', 'considerably', 'superior', 'SHADOWS', 'Cassavetes', 'film', 'been', 'frequently', 'compared.Those', 'awful', 'T-shirts', 'Marnie', 'wears', 'are', 'enough', 'reason', 'dock', 'film', 'star', 'however']",Funny Ha Ha
916534,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0009Y25ZU,Lee Armstrong,"[7, 10]","""Funny Ha Ha"" was not a film which made me laugh.  It made me nervous.  The characters seemed uncomfortable with themselves.  They twitched and reached out toward their desires and then as quickly pulled their hands away.  My favorite character was Jennifer L. Schaper's Rachel who seemed to be a hippie, comfortable with herself and her relationship with Dave.  While she wasn't movie-star gorgeous by any means, she seemed to be the girl next door that you hoped would live nearby.  The low production values of the film make you want to root for it.  But a funny -- not funny as in humorous, but more funny like peculiar -- thing happens about halfway through the movie.  You wonder if anything is ever going to actually happen.  We see Kate Dollenmayer's Marnie plodding through various employment situations and trying on relationships like gloves that don't fit too well.  I was tired; so I fast-forwarded through the rest of the film to see if something happened.  It didn't seem like it, but I decided to return the next day and actually finish watching the movie, just so I could say I'd done it.  I did it.  Why, I don't know.  Filmmaker Andrew Bujalski has a nervous Woody Allen-like style that would be more appealing if he also had a sense of humor.  Christian Rudder as Alex looked like he could be a romantic interest, but then he maybe got married to a girl without having a ceremony.  Myles Paige's Dave drunkenly puts the moves on Marnie in an automobile and then leaves without cashing in.  Kate Dollenmayer won the Best Actress Runner Up Award of the National Society of Film Critics for this in 2005.  I'm not sure what she ran up to, or why they wanted to recognize this.  I didn't find a great artistic statement in this movie.  If you're looking to cheer about this, it's boy gets 16 mm camera, boy shoots movie, boy gets it on DVD and makes a second film.  Nothing in the movie itself grabbed me.  In the end, I wished I rented a different movie.  ""Boring Snore Snore"" would have been a better title.

Sure, made with 16 mm, but really, Andrew Bujalski, director and actor, could have filmed for far less money with a digital camera.  For those of us writing our own stuff and lining up our amateur actors, Funny Ha Ha is a wild success.A nerds dream, Kate Dollenmayer, not so pretty that the good lookin' guys whisk her away, but quirky, and cute enough for the nerds to go bananas.  As a twenty-three year-old ex-college student, she is bored out of her mind by paper shuffling jobs and a social whirl that is not unlike dorm life, but more urban trendy in a run down apartment way.  Ah, how we remember all those crash pads of yore.  Nothing has changed since the sixties.  Kate drinks too much, wanders around in a daze too much, and is in love with a guy as dazed and unsure as she.  She could have sex anytime with anyone to relieve tension, but has sex not at all.  A couple of kisses with a boy here and there are as much as our slackers will chance.  I got a kick out of the Russian Scholar Woman's interpretation of Marnie's lifestyle in the commentary feature.  She claims that two-hundred years ago falling in love was dangerous.  Either you got married, had a family, or you killed yourself.  Today, these slackers of the last half century take no risk in love.  They merely move in circular social sets defined by their lack of articulation.  No one ever says I love you aloud seriously.

916538,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0009Y25ZU,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","First time filmmaker Andrew Bujalski's extremely low-budget feature ""Funny Ha Ha"" has many of the hallmarks of an early John Cassavetes film:  grainy camerawork, minimalist storytelling, and naturalistic, ad lib performances.Bujalski's cast of characters is made up entirely of white urban youth in their early to mid 20's - that awkward period in life after an individual has finished college yet before he has moved on to building his own career and family.  Given what appears to be their first real taste of freedom and independence, the characters do little but sit around, get drunk, and talk about their romantic relationships, but Bujalski observes all this without hysteria and judgment, thereby lending the film the aura of real life being caught on film.The focal point is an attractive young woman named Marnie (Kate Dollenmayer) who drinks a bit too much, seems vaguely directionless and lacking in energy, and is somewhat inexperienced in the ways of love, but who, nevertheless, seems reasonably well grounded and knows her own limits as a person.""Funny Ha Ha,"" despite its occasional raggedness and self-indulgence, is blessedly free of contrivance and melodramatics.  These may not be the most goal-oriented or socially-conscious youth we've ever encountered in the movies, but neither are they the most troubled or self-destructive.  They seem like pretty ordinary kids living in the moment and only vaguely aware that there's a world outside of themselves that they are destined to become a part of in the very near future.The beauty of the dialogue rests in its ability to capture with uncanny accuracy the way people in the real world actually speak.  The characters interact in ways that are genuine and believable, and life just seems to be unfolding as we watch it on screen.  This is due in small measure to the fine performances from a cast of virtual unknowns who know how to appear relaxed, honest and natural in front of the camera.With its improvisational and off-the-cuff filmmaking style and its abrupt, the-camera-just-ran-out-of-film ending, ""Funny Ha Ha"" makes us feel as if we are eavesdropping on the daily lives of a handful of relative strangers.  Lucky for us, they turn out to be people in whom we can see something of ourselves reflected, and with whom we enjoy spending our time.",4,winning independent feature,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,2322,"['First', 'time', 'filmmaker', 'Andrew', 'Bujalski', 'extremely', 'low-budget', 'feature', 'Funny', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'many', 'hallmarks', 'early', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'film', 'grainy', 'camerawork', 'minimalist', 'storytelling', 'naturalistic', 'ad', 'lib', 'performances.Bujalski', 'cast', 'characters', 'made', 'up', 'entirely', 'white', 'urban', 'youth', 'early', 'mid', '20', 'awkward', 'period', 'life', 'individual', 'finished', 'college', 'yet', 'moved', 'building', 'own', 'career', 'family', 'Given', 'what', 'be', 'first', 'real', 'taste', 'freedom', 'independence', 'characters', 'do', 'little', 'sit', 'around', 'get', 'drunk', 'talk', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'Bujalski', 'hysteria', 'judgment', 'thereby', 'lending', 'film', 'aura', 'real', 'life', 'being', 'caught', 'film.The', 'focal', 'point', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Marnie', 'Kate', 'Dollenmayer', 'who', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'vaguely', 'directionless', 'lacking', 'energy', 'somewhat', 'inexperienced', 'ways', 'love', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'reasonably', 'well', 'grounded', 'own', 'limits', 'person', 'Funny', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'occasional', 'raggedness', 'self-indulgence', 'blessedly', 'free', 'contrivance', 'melodramatics', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'goal-oriented', 'socially-conscious', 'youth', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'movies', 'are', 'most', 'troubled', 'self-destructive', 'seem', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'kids', 'living', 'moment', 'only', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'world', 'are', 'destined', 'become', 'part', 'very', 'future.The', 'beauty', 'dialogue', 'ability', 'capture', 'uncanny', 'accuracy', 'way', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'actually', 'speak', 'characters', 'interact', 'ways', 'are', 'genuine', 'believable', 'life', 'just', 'be', 'unfolding', 'watch', 'screen', 'due', 'small', 'measure', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast', 'virtual', 'unknowns', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'appear', 'relaxed', 'honest', 'natural', 'front', 'camera.With', 'improvisational', 'off-the-cuff', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'abrupt', 'the-camera-just-ran-out-of-film', 'ending', 'Funny', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'feel', 'are', 'eavesdropping', 'daily', 'lives', 'handful', 'relative', 'strangers', 'Lucky', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'people', 'whom', 'can', 'see', 'something', 'ourselves', 'reflected', 'whom', 'enjoy', 'spending', 'time']",Funny Ha Ha

This is indeed a film that draws its audience in mysteriously in spite of the fact that little happens and that the characters (one really thinks of them more as people) rarely are able to express a complete thought in a complete sentence.The pleasure is voyeuristic. The viewer feels as if she is watching real life over the shoulder of the camera. The low budget ""tech package"" (as one reviewer called it) adds to the effect, as do even Marnie's sad shapeless t-shirts. The mother in me wanted to order her up some new clothes. If only she'd spend a little time at the make-up counter at NM, she could clearly snare Alex (not that he's worth the trouble, esp. now that he's married to Liz!). I think she should cultivate that friendship with Jackie the chic librarian, who knows how to put an outfit together and will be able to set her up with the cute barristo.Well, you get the point: a seductive movie that keeps it real.",4,Less Is More,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,1002,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'add', 'precise', 'appreciative', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'indeed', 'film', 'audience', 'mysteriously', 'spite', 'fact', 'little', 'happens', 'characters', 'one', 'really', 'more', 'people', 'rarely', 'are', 'able', 'express', 'complete', 'thought', 'complete', 'sentence.The', 'pleasure', 'voyeuristic', 'viewer', 'feels', 'watching', 'real', 'life', 'shoulder', 'camera', 'low', 'budget', 'tech', 'package', 'one', 'reviewer', 'called', 'effect', 'do', 'even', 'Marnie', 'sad', 'shapeless', 't-shirts', 'mother', 'wanted', 'order', 'up', 'new', 'clothes', 'only', ""'d"", 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'make-up', 'counter', 'NM', 'could', 'clearly', 'snare', 'Alex', 'not', 'trouble', 'esp', 'now', 'married', 'Liz', 'think', 'should', 'cultivate', 'friendship', 'Jackie', 'chic', 'librarian', 'who', 'how', 'put', 'outfit', 'together', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'set', 'up', 'cute', 'barristo.Well', 'get', 'point', 'seductive', 'movie', 'real']",Funny Ha Ha
