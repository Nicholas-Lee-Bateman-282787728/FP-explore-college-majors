I liked the atmosphere in the small town with a big creepy house sitting alone.  Also the camera angles were nice.  They stretched in some of the hall shots and over head views were given in tight spots.  I also liked the way the camera focused on the door with the glass rose.  I also liked the mystery the movie revolved around.  The ghosts were done nicely.  Yes they were pale and the little girl had long hair but at least her hair was blonde and didn't hang in her face all the time and she didn't move in quick intervals.,4,creppy little mystery,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,669,"['was', 'very', 'pleased', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'beginning', 'picked', 'up', 'once', 'got', 'help', 'paranormal', 'investigator', 'liked', 'atmosphere', 'small', 'town', 'big', 'creepy', 'house', 'sitting', 'alone', 'Also', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'nice', 'stretched', 'hall', 'shots', 'head', 'views', 'were', 'given', 'tight', 'spots', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'camera', 'focused', 'door', 'glass', 'rose', 'also', 'liked', 'mystery', 'movie', 'revolved', 'around', 'ghosts', 'were', 'done', 'nicely', 'Yes', 'were', 'pale', 'little', 'girl', 'had', 'long', 'hair', 'least', 'hair', 'was', 'blonde', 'did', ""n't"", 'hang', 'face', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'quick', 'intervals']",The Marsh

1050733,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000MTFDBK,Grady Harp,"[8, 14]","THE MARSH is yet another scary movie to satisfy the apparently inexhaustible demand for fright films of this genre.  It is obviously a low budget film that suffers from a silly script resurrecting tired themes of communication with ghosts and the intervention of paranormal specialists.Successful children's book author and illustrator Claire Holloway (Gabrielle Anwar) is besieged by recurrent nightmares that prompt her therapist to recommend a sabbatical, advice she heeds as she moves out into the country to a little creepy town called Marshville.  She rents a old house near the marsh from a woman Mercy (Brooke Johnson) and discovers from the local newspaper editor Noah (Justin Louis) that the town is riddled with history of hauntings following the disappearance of a little girl into the marshes, the victim of sexual assault that has never been adequately investigated.  Claire's time in her new 'home' is racked with appearances of the dead little girl and her muddy perpetrator and she finally seeks the help of a Paranormal expert Hunt (Forest Whitaker) who helps her solve the etiology of Claire's nightmares and provides an exit for the ghosts.Most of the film is dark with poor Claire just wandering around the creepy house with her open-mouthed/wide-eyed frightened look, avoiding the flying detritus caused by the angry spirits that haunt her. Gabrielle Anwar is beautiful to look at but is not really called upon to act.  Likewise Forest Whitaker is paralyzed by an inept script that even this fine actor can't overcome.  The music is the canned, synthesizer  variety and the camera work is jerky and gets in the way of the story.  This is a movie for avid fans of scary flicks who can overlook the multiple production and writing problems.

1050742,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000MTFDBK,Z Hayes,"[3, 4]","I had mixed feelings watching this movie. The Marsh is not an original horror movie as I kept comparing it to movies like Stir of Echoes, Dark Water etc as I watched it. That being said, it has an interesting though not remarkable premise, and is well-shot. Gabrielle Anwar [who seems to be in quite a few horror movies these days] plays a children's book author, Claire Holloway who keeps having disturbing nightmares about her childhood and events she no longer remembers as having occured. Upon seeing a familiar place on tv, she ventures out to a small town in Westmoreland County, Marshville, where she leases a house she finds disturbingly familiar.It doesn't take long for Claire to encounter spooky entities and experience disturbing visions. She enlists the aid of a spook consultant, Geoffry Hunt [Forest Whitaker] and he helps her discover the truth behind Claire's visions. It appears that Claire's 'return' to the town of Marshville has unleashed supernatural entities that are seeking revenge for a tragedy long past and Claire is somehow in the center of it.The effects are good for what I assume is a low-budget movie - the entities look creepy enough, and the scares are the usual blink and you'll miss it kind. The movie also has a sufficiently bleak and menacing atmosphere, especially in the scenes where the entities wreak havoc.As for the acting, both Anwar as Claire and Whitaker as Hunt do a credible job with the script they are given, though I felt this role was far beneath Whitaker's talent [this movie was before The Last King of Scotland for which he deservedly won an Oscar].True horror fans who feel they deserve better may not appreciate this as much, but I felt it was worth a rental and the story held my attention till the end.",3,"Lacks originality, yet atmospheric and creepy",1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,1763,"['had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'watching', 'movie', 'Marsh', 'not', 'original', 'horror', 'movie', 'kept', 'comparing', 'movies', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'Dark', 'Water', 'etc', 'watched', 'being', 'said', 'interesting', 'not', 'remarkable', 'premise', 'well-shot', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', '[', 'who', 'be', 'quite', 'few', 'horror', 'movies', 'days', ']', 'children', 'book', 'author', 'Claire', 'Holloway', 'who', 'having', 'disturbing', 'nightmares', 'childhood', 'events', 'no', 'longer', 'remembers', 'having', 'occured', 'seeing', 'familiar', 'place', 'tv', 'ventures', 'out', 'small', 'town', 'Westmoreland', 'County', 'Marshville', 'where', 'house', 'disturbingly', 'familiar.It', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Claire', 'encounter', 'spooky', 'entities', 'experience', 'disturbing', 'visions', 'aid', 'spook', 'consultant', 'Geoffry', 'Hunt', '[', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', ']', 'discover', 'truth', 'Claire', 'visions', 'Claire', ""'return"", 'town', 'Marshville', 'unleashed', 'supernatural', 'entities', 'are', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'tragedy', 'long', 'past', 'Claire', 'somehow', 'center', 'it.The', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'what', 'assume', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'entities', 'look', 'creepy', 'enough', 'scares', 'are', 'usual', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'kind', 'movie', 'also', 'sufficiently', 'bleak', 'menacing', 'atmosphere', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'entities', 'wreak', 'havoc.As', 'acting', 'Anwar', 'Claire', 'Whitaker', 'Hunt', 'do', 'credible', 'job', 'script', 'are', 'given', 'felt', 'role', 'was', 'far', 'beneath', 'Whitaker', 'talent', '[', 'movie', 'was', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', ']', '.True', 'horror', 'fans', 'who', 'feel', 'deserve', 'better', 'may', 'not', 'appreciate', 'much', 'felt', 'was', 'worth', 'rental', 'story', 'held', 'attention', 'end']",The Marsh
