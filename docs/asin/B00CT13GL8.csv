1650725,AOS5ZBTQX7QIT,B00CT13GL8,D. Barbour,"[32, 38]","Las Vegas is a fun, slightly silly romp around Sin City.  The first three seasons do a great job of capturing the Vegas feel while mixing both comedy and suspense with the result being a  fairly addictive show.  I would say the most important thing to note is that NBC cancelled the show abruptly, so season five ends with a BIG cliffhanger that never gets resolved.  It's so disappointing. That being said, if this is a decent price, the first three seasons are extremely enjoyable and are still worth your time.",3,A great show until season 4...and the story cuts off due to cancellation,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,513,"['Las', 'Vegas', 'fun', 'slightly', 'silly', 'romp', 'Sin', 'City', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'Vegas', 'feel', 'mixing', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'result', 'being', 'fairly', 'addictive', 'show', 'would', 'say', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'note', 'NBC', 'cancelled', 'show', 'abruptly', 'season', 'five', 'ends', 'BIG', 'cliffhanger', 'never', 'resolved', 'so', 'disappointing', 'being', 'said', 'decent', 'price', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'still', 'time']",Las Vegas:  The Complete Series
