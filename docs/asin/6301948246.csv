273987,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6301948246,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[34, 35]","Based on Mario Vargas Llosa's semi-autobiographical novel ""Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter"", this is a charming film with some laughs, tenderness, and good performances.Peter Falk plays the highly imaginitive Pedro Carmichael, who writes radio soap operas. One of Pedro's plot devices is to pick a nation that he can blame everything on, and the lucky ""country of the month"" in his latest soap is Albania, which creates controversy, a huge audience, and eventual havoc. Some of the funniest moments in the film are when the soap opera ""comes to life""...Dan Hedeya, as a one-eyed exterminator (watch for the neon rat over the front door of his mansion) is hilarious in his caricature of a crazed bigot.Barbara Hershey is excellent as the ""older woman"", and Keanu Reeves as Martin is utterly lovable in one of his most likable performances. He does well with his Louisiana accent, and portrays a youthful naivete that's engaging and believable...and oh my goodness, the man is a work of art. Total beauty in human form.One of my favorite scenes is between Martin and Pedro in the cafe, when Martin says: ""I think I kinda want to be a writer..."", and it's clever how the titles are read like an old radio show by Henry Gibson. The early 50's era is captured well in the art direction and Wynton Marsalis provides some terrific music.On the minus side, a few of Pedro's schemes are a little slow and weak, bogging the film down at times, but overall, if you're in the mood for some light and slightly off-beat entertainment, this might fit the bill.",4,sweet and funny early Keanu,1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,1545,"['Based', 'Mario', 'Vargas', 'Llosa', 'semi-autobiographical', 'novel', 'Aunt', 'Julia', 'Scriptwriter', 'charming', 'film', 'laughs', 'tenderness', 'good', 'performances.Peter', 'Falk', 'highly', 'imaginitive', 'Pedro', 'Carmichael', 'who', 'radio', 'soap', 'operas', 'One', 'Pedro', 'plot', 'devices', 'pick', 'nation', 'can', 'blame', 'everything', 'lucky', 'country', 'month', 'latest', 'soap', 'Albania', 'controversy', 'huge', 'audience', 'eventual', 'havoc', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'soap', 'opera', 'life', 'Dan', 'Hedeya', 'one-eyed', 'exterminator', 'watch', 'neon', 'rat', 'front', 'door', 'mansion', 'hilarious', 'caricature', 'crazed', 'bigot.Barbara', 'Hershey', 'excellent', 'older', 'woman', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Martin', 'utterly', 'lovable', 'one', 'most', 'likable', 'performances', 'well', 'Louisiana', 'accent', 'youthful', 'naivete', 'engaging', 'believable', 'oh', 'goodness', 'man', 'work', 'art', 'Total', 'beauty', 'human', 'form.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'Martin', 'Pedro', 'cafe', 'when', 'Martin', 'think', 'kinda', 'want', 'be', 'writer', 'clever', 'how', 'titles', 'are', 'read', 'old', 'radio', 'show', 'Henry', 'Gibson', 'early', '50', 'era', 'captured', 'well', 'art', 'direction', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'terrific', 'music.On', 'minus', 'side', 'few', 'Pedro', 'schemes', 'are', 'little', 'slow', 'weak', 'bogging', 'film', 'down', 'times', 'overall', ""'re"", 'mood', 'light', 'slightly', 'off-beat', 'entertainment', 'might', 'fit', 'bill']",N/A

You hope for the best, but sometimes you get the worst.This is one of those movies where you have to wonder if all involved couldn't see that it was going all wrong.  Barbara Hershey had been on something of a roll in the late 80s.  Why I remember a time when there were THREE Hershey movies playing simultaneously playing at the local art house in Albany, NY. (For the record, the were ""A World Apart,"" ""Shy People,"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ."").  In this botch, she still manages to acquit herself fairly well, but it is plainly not the prestige project she was probably hoping for.  As for Peter Falk, well, he does his Peter Falk shtick as per usual.  It works better here than in, say, ""Vibes,""  but he'd have done better to stick to Columbo films and the occasional art film like ""Wings of Desire.""The actor who comes off the best here is Keanu Reeves, believe it or not.  Although this was relatively early in Keanu's career, he was already in desparate need of a ""serious vehicle"" after ""Bill and Ted..."" and other juvenilia had pretty much turned his name into a punch line for late night comedians.  His role here is not all that demanding a one, really.  He basically does the earnest, idealistic young writer bit with all the earnestness and idealism he can muster.  It's not Academy Award caliber by any means, but he pulls it off well enough.The ""art vs. life"" theme that is the core of the film is so mangled that it seems like a bad joke.  Falk's Pedro Carmichael is not an artist, but a hack, and Keanu's Martin Loader character is untested as an artist.  Hershey's supposedly colorful Aunt Julia may be seen as something on an artist figure herself (or at least as a bohemian of sorts), but none of these characters really offers much in the way of vision or insight.  It's mostly just craziness for craziness's sake (check out Pedro's inexplicable arrival in a fire truck at the movie's close--it seems more desparate and contrived than insprired madcap.)If you're a Reeves, Hershey or Falk fan, of course, you'll want to check this movie out.

274000,A3ELSU1SHRX09Y,6301948246,skunktrain,"[23, 23]","I laughed out loud so many times during this movie. It was truly a delight.It centers around a young writer (Reeves) who becomes smitten with his world-weary older aunt (well, aunt-by-marriage -- they are not blood relatives). Barbara Hershey plays the aunt, who plays the lovely 36-year-old divorcee who finds herself attracted to this sweet 21-year-old young man. She thinks she wants someone ""older"" and ""dull,"" so she can have some stability in her life. But, as her sister tells her later -- ""You won't change. You're too wild."" So she ends up falling for this younger man who has dreams of being a writer in Paris.Their romance is sweet and heartfelt, but the true hilarity comes in the form of Peter Falk, who plays an extremely eccentric radio serial writer who is manipulating the whole town with his sensational writing. The town loves the tabloid-like melodrama he interjects into the plots; they are completely hooked. And Falk gets a lot of his ideas for the story by setting up Reeves and Hershey -- encouraging their romance (and then lifting big parts of their conversations to each other and putting it in the radio show). He also manipulates the whole town by targeting Albanians. Over and over, Albanian jokes. Albanian slander. The Albanians in town take notice!The absurdity of the overripe plots of the radio serial are absolutely *hilarious*. We are taken into the ""world"" of the radio serial plot, where actors Peter Gallagher, Dan Hedaya, Elizabeth McGovern, John Larroquette, and Hope Lange play the ""fictional"" characters come to life in everyone's imaginations. These scenes are particularly hilarious, especially when you learn to wait for the Albanian jokes to emerge. And you *know* that they will!One thing I will confess when I first heard about this movie: I was puzzled how they got the ""incestuous"" romance between Reeves' character and his ""aunt"" to work without creeping us all out. But, the ""incest"" thing quickly dispelled  early in the movie. She's just an ""aunt-in-law,"" of a sort. Not a ""real"" aunt. The story wouldn't have worked had she been a flesh-and-blood aunt, because we would have been too aware of the stigma that would exist in such a relationship.This was a sweet, unusual movie.

Peter Falk is the stand-out here and the beautiful Barbara Hershey shines.  The consistenly dull Keanu Reeves is even bearable in this one.

Barbara Hershey is also at her peak as the older Aunt who, despite being a total realist, can't help but fall in love with the smitten Keanu. Add in Peter Falk's fall-down-funny portrail of a famous radio serial writer who almost always is driven out of town and who helps to engineer their romance, a healthy dose of suspense, some magical realism, truly great cameos, and a clever and witty script, and you have just about the best time you can have on a sofa for two hours. The lush New Orleans setting and the wonderful flashes of the (totally hilarious) radio soap cry out for a DVD version. Just thinking about this movie brings a smile to my face. I highly recommend it.",5,NEEDS to be on DVD,998611200,"08 24, 2001",2001,791,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'presence', 'Keanu-', 'very', 'good', 'funny', 'fanciful', 'generally', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'also', 'peak', 'older', 'Aunt', 'who', 'being', 'total', 'realist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'smitten', 'Keanu', 'Add', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'fall-down-funny', 'portrail', 'famous', 'radio', 'serial', 'writer', 'who', 'almost', 'always', 'driven', 'town', 'who', 'engineer', 'romance', 'healthy', 'dose', 'suspense', 'magical', 'realism', 'truly', 'great', 'cameos', 'clever', 'witty', 'script', 'have', 'just', 'best', 'time', 'can', 'have', 'sofa', 'two', 'hours', 'lush', 'New', 'Orleans', 'setting', 'wonderful', 'flashes', 'totally', 'hilarious', 'radio', 'soap', 'cry', 'DVD', 'version', 'Just', 'thinking', 'movie', 'smile', 'face', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
