953871,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B000BZ9TKG,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","Like most people who grow up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (known to many as the LDS church, or Mormons), I grew up watching this play and its film production countless times.  I had most, if not all, of the songs memorized, and embraced it as a mainstay of the LDS culture.  Over the years our VHS copy of the film went missing, but I still listened to the soundtrack on a regular basis and committed the songs to memory, even the goofiest ones.  I understood that this wasn't the full version of the play -- my mom had an old cast recording with some songs on it that either aren't in this version or have been altered somewhat -- but it was still a classic in my mind.Going back and revisiting this play as an adult, with several more musicals under my belt, I find this play isn't quite as masterful as I first thought.  The message is as strong as ever, but there's quite a bit of cheesiness in the execution.""Saturday's Warrior"" tells the story of an LDS family, beginning with the pre-existence -- the life souls live before coming to Earth -- as they excitedly prepare to be born and promise to look out for one another.  Jimmy vows to look after the family and make sure the youngest child, Emily, isn't forgotten.  Meanwhile, sister Julie pledges her love to Todd, and they vow to find one another on Earth, while Wally and Harold, two other souls, are eager to go to Earth and become missionaries for the Lord.  Upon coming to Earth, however, almost all of these promises are forgotten, and Jimmy finds himself at odds with his family, distancing himself from them and growing increasingly disgusted with his parents' insistence on having more kids, to the point where he allies himself with his friends' ""zero population"" stance.  Julie, meanwhile, is engaged to Wally, and is eagerly awaiting his return from his mission, while Todd finds himself aimlessly drifting without purpose in his life.  Can Jimmy's disabled twin sister, Pam, get him to remember his promise and mend the rift with his family, or will it take a tragedy to reunite the family and rekindle promises made in heaven?If you haven't already guessed from the plot summary, this play is steeped in religion and LDS culture, and may be nearly impenetrable to a non-LDS audience.  If one isn't familiar with doctrine of the church, such as the Plan of Salvation, the Pre-Existence, and the basics of missionary life and culture, they're bound to be very confused watching this.  There's nothing wrong with making a play geared toward a specific audience, such as toward a certain sect of faith, but this play's narrow focus is still something to keep in mind, and anyone planning to show it to someone not of the LDS faith should be prepared to answer questions.The quality of the play itself is rather sub-par, even by LDS film standards.  The play was written in the '60s and filmed in the late '80s, and it shows in the dated costumes and dialogue of the characters.  The sets are minimalistic and in some cases almost completely nonexistent, and at times the quality of the film makes it look like it's being filmed with a home video camera.  The acting is passable but not great, and unfortunately many of the actors can't sing very well, leading to some embarrassingly off-key moments.The songs themselves are a mixed bag.  Yes, many of them are classics, and there are some absolutely gorgeous numbers that I personally love -- ""Feelings Of Forever,"" ""Sailing On,"" ""Line Upon Line,"" and the titular ""Saturday's Warrior"" are gorgeous and uplifting, and I will never tire of listening to them.  Others, such as ""Pulling Together,"" ""Brace Me Up,"" and ""Circle Of Our Love,"" are passable but not particularly memorable, and still others -- ""He's Just a Friend,"" ""Will I Wait For You?,"" ""Daddy's Nose,"" and ""Humble Way"" -- are embarrassingly corny and difficult to listen to.  Oddly enough, the songs that are closest to mainstream music and the catchiest in my minds are the ""villain"" songs, ""Zero Population"" and ""Summer Of Fair Weather.""  An intentional statement by the creators, or just plain unfortunate coincidence?And the story of the play, while well-meaning and with good intentions, can come across as heavy-handed.  It does stay fairly faithful to LDS beliefs, and I'm sure many struggling teens can identify with Jimmy as he struggles to find his place and reconcile his personal beliefs with the world around him.  And it's hard to fault the writers for wanting to create a work that promotes family and good values in a world where both are increasingly falling out of favor.  But the message is told in a rather heavy-handed way that can be off-putting to the viewer.  And the play interjects it's own ""doctrine"" at points which has only served to further confuse both members of the LDS church and non-members -- no, our church doesn't believe in pre-destination when it comes to finding the one you love...A well-intentioned play, but somewhat amateurish and heavy-handed in the execution.
