But although I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the film (dark and generally ominous) as well as the actors' performances, I felt like I was missing something.  It's like some of the major plot points are missing entirely: What's with the spiders? What's with the psychiatrist? What really happened to that guy who ""committed suicide?"" I think I read on here that this release was originally part of a substantially longer series, which makes sense to me because at times Toby (Pattinson) refers to events that are never shown onscreen: for example, that his doctor revealed his (the doctor's) master was the devil. Why wouldn't they have filmed that scene?  If this is true, the extent of the editing really damages the film, plotwise, and creates holes that are nearly impossible to fill in, unless, I presume, you have read the novel, ""The Haunting of Toby Jugg,"" on which the film is based. I personally have not. And if I am mistaken and this is a true, un-cut version, there are just plot-holes, period.  In the end, you really can't tell just what it is that is driving Toby mad, if he is indeed mad, or if he has somehow been possessed.  And what is up with all the cigarettes?  I went back and watched it again and counted at least twenty had been lit up, and if you take into account multiple takes of scenes, at least a quarter of the budget had to have gone to the tobacco industry.

1266188,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B002FG9N78,J from NY,"[8, 10]","Dennis Wheatley's short horror story ""The Haunting of Toby Jugg"" was an eerie, short tour de force in horror literature that, while not matching up quite with the work of Lovecraft or James, still stands out today as a gem.  A young Lieutenant in the RAF is crippled in the war and returns to a creepy looking mansion in Wales, which is either haunted or the subject of his psychological projections.  Hammer studios, that great British film production company, produced a classic with a young Christopher Lee entitled ""The Devil Rides Out"" which gave the story superb treatment.""The Haunted Airman"", starring ""teen heartthrob"" Robert Pattinson, is a 70 minute exercise in pointless flashbacks, panasonic 1970's style war reminiscences, and absurd looking spiders crawling all over the pratically nude ""star"".  In fact, there were so many shots of him in bathtubs (smoking cigarette after cigarette with a starry gaze) and sitting in his wheelchair that I wondered if the director had more of a prolonged ""photo shoot"" in mind; the movie will at least produce a lot of posters for 14 year old girls to fawn over.  If his good looks are all Pattinson has going for him as an actor, I hope he finds the fountain of youth somewhere in Britain.Julian Sands plays the villainous psychiatrist who seems to want to dominate Toby's life and mind.  He steals his letters, behaves strangely, flirts with his aunt (who Toby is having an incestuous relationship with) and generally behaves like a big mindf**k with a huge nose.  Sands is the best actor in this movie, recalling his unpleasant role in ""Her Name is Carla"".  All the atmosphere that is built up, all the foreboding, all of this is is really a kind of meandering predicated upon the false notion that this will all lead to something.  The ending is pitiable in it's predictability.

1266220,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002FG9N78,Z Hayes,"[36, 40]","""The Haunted Airman"" sees Twilight's Robert Pattinson flex his acting muscles in a demanding role. The story itself is based on ""The Haunting of Toby Jugg"" (1948) by Dennis Wheatley, an author famous for his thrillers and occult novels in the 50s and 60s (notably ""The Devil Rides Out"" which was also made into a movie by Hammer Studios). I read the original story and loved it, and that is why I picked it up (not because of RP's role in it though I must say I was impressed by his performance). By the way, this is a BBC production.The story centers around Lt. Toby Jugg (Rob Pattinson) who is hurt in action during WW II and becomes confined in a wheelchair. He is taken by his aunt Julia (Rachael Stirling) to recuperate at the remote country clinic of Dr Hal Burns (Julian Sands who last impressed me in Boxing Helena). Soon enough, Toby realizes strange things are afoot as he begins to experience strange visions of spiders and other curious goings-on.This plays out more as a psychological suspense drama than a true horror story. Those who have read the original source material will find some elements missing such as the theme of Satanism which was prevalent in the written material. Rob Pattinson as well as the other main characters are credible in their respective roles, but Pattinson's role is a far cry from Edward in Twilight. In fact, I actually think he showcases his real acting talent here, but that's just my opinion. The running time, at about 70 mins, is quite short, and there are no extras on the DVD, just a trailer of the feature. The picture quality can be a bit grainy, which I assume is intentional,to add on to the atmosphere. The movie, though short, can be a bit plodding at times, but this is a movie that portrays the emotional and psychological troubles of a young man, so the slow-paced storyline is actually appropriate here.  On the whole, I liked the movie as it's high on atmosphere and psychological suspense.",4,Atmospheric and creepy adaptation of an occult classic,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,1953,"['Haunted', 'Airman', 'Twilight', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscles', 'demanding', 'role', 'story', 'based', 'Haunting', 'Toby', 'Jugg', '1948', 'Dennis', 'Wheatley', 'author', 'famous', 'thrillers', 'occult', 'novels', '50s', '60s', 'notably', 'Devil', 'Rides', 'Out', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'movie', 'Hammer', 'Studios', 'read', 'original', 'story', 'loved', 'why', 'picked', 'up', 'not', 'RP', 'role', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'performance', 'way', 'BBC', 'production.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Lt.', 'Toby', 'Jugg', 'Rob', 'Pattinson', 'who', 'hurt', 'action', 'WW', 'II', 'becomes', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'taken', 'aunt', 'Julia', 'Rachael', 'Stirling', 'recuperate', 'remote', 'country', 'clinic', 'Dr', 'Hal', 'Burns', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'who', 'last', 'impressed', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'Soon', 'enough', 'Toby', 'strange', 'things', 'are', 'afoot', 'experience', 'strange', 'visions', 'spiders', 'other', 'curious', 'goings-on.This', 'out', 'more', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'drama', 'true', 'horror', 'story', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'will', 'find', 'elements', 'missing', 'such', 'theme', 'Satanism', 'was', 'prevalent', 'written', 'material', 'Rob', 'Pattinson', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'credible', 'respective', 'roles', 'Pattinson', 'role', 'far', 'cry', 'Edward', 'Twilight', 'fact', 'actually', 'think', 'real', 'acting', 'talent', 'here', 'just', 'opinion', 'running', 'time', '70', 'mins', 'quite', 'short', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'just', 'trailer', 'feature', 'picture', 'quality', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'grainy', 'assume', 'intentional', 'add', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'short', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'plodding', 'times', 'movie', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'troubles', 'young', 'man', 'slow-paced', 'storyline', 'actually', 'appropriate', 'here', 'whole', 'liked', 'movie', 'high', 'atmosphere', 'psychological', 'suspense']",N/A
