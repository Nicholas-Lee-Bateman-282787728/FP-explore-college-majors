This is why it gets 4 stars and not 5 stars.This is a set of 5 disks.  The first 4 are basically the original individual disk releases with all the extras ripped out.  The start up screen is no longer animated but shows a still picture of Sakaki with the cat hanging onto her finger.The 5th disk concerns me.  It contains all the episodes on the original disks 5 and 6.  It contains a total of 7 episodes.  I worry that they may have increase the compression of the video to fit the episodes in.You know, considering that they have to change the masters of disks 1 to 4 to rip out the extras, they might as well have redistributed the episodes more evenly to the 5 disks.  I mean they have to make new masters anyway right?  Damn, I hate sloppy work!I like the packaging.  A thinpak is essentially a box set containing the disks in thin plastic DVD cases instead of the standard thicker ones.  It actually saves you shelf space.  What you sacrifice are the paper inserts.

926071,A1C7OW2QBJKU6J,B000ADKWNM,Brooks Austin,"[11, 12]","This is by far the funniest anime I have ever seen.  Azumanga Daioh is different than most anime in that it doesn't feature a continous storyline with over-the-top action and angsty teenage drama.  In fact, Azumanga Daioh doesn't have any plot at all.  It simply follows the ordinary lives of Japanese school girls Chiyo, Osaka, Yomi, Tomo, Kagura, Kaorin, and Sakaki, as they live their normal, ordinary lives.  Every episode is filled with tons of hilarious moments that'll have you laughing at the edge of your seat the entire time.  Not once did I ever feel sad when watching this series, expcet possibly when it was over because I didn't want it to end.  The show is just all about having fun and enjoying life.For a series that's so plotless, there's a surprising amount of character development here.  Even without the added drama of a complex love triangle that you typically find in most high school-related anime, the characters mature a lot and their friendships grow throughout the series while they still retain their little quirks that made them such a unique cast.  Azumanga Daioh suprisingly doesn't cut many corners with the animation like you would normally expect from a comedy like this, but just about everything is animated with rich detail (expect for maybe things like the crowds at school in unimportant scenes) and all the characters have a unique design about them despite not having all the exaggerated features of most anime characters, like bizarre haircolors and styles.  The music is always bouncy and catchy, filled with lots of energy.  The opening theme song is as random as the show itself and the ending theme is sweet, cute, and relaxing.Azumanga Daioh is just an overall enjoyable comical show that you just can't help but to love.  If there was one thing I could complain about this release is the boxset's lack of extras.  While I'm glad ADV re-released this series in a cheaper boxset making it more affordable for me to buy, I really miss not having any extras here.  Normally, I don't care much about bonus features on DVDs, especially for anime, but with Azumanga Daioh, I feel like they were important to keep.  The main reason being that two of the extras that were only included on the single volume DVDs were two animated shorts: Azumanga Daioh-The Very Short Movie and Azumanga Web Daioh.  Being a plotless anime, these shorts aren't neccessary to watch to be able to understand and enjoy the series as a whole, but they're essential in completing any Azumanga Daioh fan's collection.Despite the lack of extras, this boxset was still worth it for the chance to finally be able to see this hilarious anime for such a low price.  I just hope that ADV will include extras in their future thinpack sets.  Azumanga Daioh is definetly one of the zaniest, most hilarious anime series I've ever seen.  It never fails to put a smile on your face and it's so unique because it's just so different from most of your average anime.  However, I can't really recommend this series to everyone.  The show relies a lot on humor you could only understand if you have a general knowledge of Japanese culture.  The series also features a lot of slapstick comedy and not everyone enjoys that kind of humor, but if you are the kind of person who does like it and if you at least have a basic knowledge of Japanese culture, Azumanga Daioh is definetly a series that you'll love. If you're looking for a drop-dead hilarious comedy anime that's different from the norm, don't hesistate on checking this series out.",4,Funniest anime ever but needs more extras,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,3540,"['far', 'funniest', 'anime', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'different', 'most', 'anime', ""n't"", 'feature', 'continous', 'storyline', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'angsty', 'teenage', 'drama', 'fact', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', ""n't"", 'have', 'plot', 'simply', 'ordinary', 'lives', 'Japanese', 'school', 'girls', 'Chiyo', 'Osaka', 'Yomi', 'Tomo', 'Kagura', 'Kaorin', 'Sakaki', 'live', 'normal', 'ordinary', 'lives', 'episode', 'filled', 'tons', 'hilarious', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'have', 'laughing', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'time', 'Not', 'once', 'did', 'ever', 'feel', 'sad', 'when', 'watching', 'series', 'expcet', 'possibly', 'when', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'show', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'enjoying', 'life.For', 'series', 'so', 'plotless', 'surprising', 'amount', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'Even', 'added', 'drama', 'complex', 'love', 'triangle', 'typically', 'find', 'most', 'high', 'school-related', 'anime', 'characters', 'mature', 'lot', 'friendships', 'grow', 'series', 'still', 'retain', 'little', 'quirks', 'made', 'unique', 'cast', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'suprisingly', ""n't"", 'cut', 'many', 'corners', 'animation', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'comedy', 'just', 'everything', 'animated', 'rich', 'detail', 'expect', 'maybe', 'things', 'crowds', 'school', 'unimportant', 'scenes', 'characters', 'have', 'unique', 'design', 'not', 'having', 'exaggerated', 'features', 'most', 'anime', 'characters', 'bizarre', 'haircolors', 'styles', 'music', 'always', 'bouncy', 'catchy', 'filled', 'lots', 'energy', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'as', 'random', 'show', 'ending', 'theme', 'sweet', 'cute', 'relaxing.Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'just', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'comical', 'show', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'could', 'complain', 'release', 'boxset', 'lack', 'extras', ""'m"", 'glad', 'ADV', 're-released', 'series', 'cheaper', 'boxset', 'making', 'more', 'affordable', 'buy', 'really', 'not', 'having', 'extras', 'here', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVDs', 'especially', 'anime', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'feel', 'were', 'important', 'keep', 'main', 'reason', 'being', 'two', 'extras', 'were', 'only', 'included', 'single', 'volume', 'DVDs', 'were', 'two', 'animated', 'shorts', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh-The', 'Very', 'Short', 'Movie', 'Azumanga', 'Web', 'Daioh', 'Being', 'plotless', 'anime', 'shorts', 'are', ""n't"", 'neccessary', 'watch', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'enjoy', 'series', 'whole', ""'re"", 'essential', 'completing', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'fan', 'collection.Despite', 'lack', 'extras', 'boxset', 'was', 'still', 'worth', 'chance', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'hilarious', 'anime', 'low', 'price', 'just', 'hope', 'ADV', 'will', 'include', 'extras', 'future', 'thinpack', 'sets', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'definetly', 'one', 'zaniest', 'most', 'hilarious', 'anime', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'never', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'so', 'unique', 'just', 'so', 'different', 'most', 'average', 'anime', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'series', 'everyone', 'show', 'lot', 'humor', 'could', 'only', 'understand', 'have', 'general', 'knowledge', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'series', 'also', 'lot', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'not', 'everyone', 'kind', 'humor', 'are', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'least', 'have', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'definetly', 'series', ""'ll"", 'love', ""'re"", 'looking', 'drop-dead', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'anime', 'different', 'norm', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesistate', 'checking', 'series', 'out']",N/A
926072,AZLC3D46UHOAK,B000ADKWNM,Bryan Weber,"[33, 35]","So many people have said that this anime, like Seinfeld, is a show about nothing. I think that viewpoint misses something.

926073,A34JAXR0W215IP,B000ADKWNM,Das Book,"[7, 7]","Hey, you know what?  I'm almost 30.  (UPDATE: I'm now 30, and I still love this series!)  I'm also a guy.  Know what else?  I don't care; I love Azumanga Daioh.  This series is fall-out-of-your-seat funny and touching all at once, packed with characters that you can't help but care about even though (or maybe because) they tend to remind the viewer of everybody they knew in high school.  Remember that one creepy teacher who liked to ogle the female students and thought he was good at hiding it?  Meet Kimura-Sensei.  That psycho chick that thought EVERYTHING was a competition?  That's Tomo.  The girl who thought she was fat even though she was as skinny as everyone else?  That's Yomi.  And so forth.  (In fairness, though, it's not that Kimura's bad at hiding his predilection; he just doesn't care if anyone knows about it or not.  No wonder his male students idolize him so...)There's something oddly reassuring about sitting down to watch this show, and realizing that even though it was produced by a culture whose roots are about as alien to our own as they could possibly be without actually being Martian, it's STILL just like you remember your own high school years.  To be sure, there are some jokes that make very little sense to an American audience, a topic I'll be getting to shortly; but by and large, Azumanga Daioh is as hilarious as it is precisely because almost everyone who watches it can relate to it in one way or another.  (It's worth noting, though, that none of the girls ever has a boyfriend, and no reason is ever given.  Osaka even says as much at one point, although her observation passes almost completely unnoticed by the other girls.)  Other reviewers have noted that the show features virtually no plot, and for some, that might be a sticking point.  That's fine.  Me, I'm not particularly fussed about it; Azumanga Daioh doesn't try to be about plot, after all, but about making you laugh, and sometimes, cry.  In this respect, the show is absolutely and wonderfully successful.Which brings me to my only real gripe against the boxed set.  Although they are by no means the majority, there are a fair number of references to Japanese culture, both pop and traditional, that require some explaining for them to make any sense to the American audience, and while the English dub does a fair job of clearing up some of them, there are some places where even that doesn't help and you're left scratching your head.  The individually-released discs include translation and cultural notes that clear most of this right up (and are often pretty funny to boot), but the box set, for some bizarre reason, includes none of these.  Without them, the viewer will more than likely be baffled as to why everyone is so frustrated with Osaka for referring to the iriomote cat as ""pikanyaa,"" or why Osaka is holding an eggplant and a hawk when she appears in Sakaki's New Year's dream.  (Not to say that all of the inexplicable bits center around Osaka; those are just the two that sprang to mind first.)  Okay, so it's not earth-shattering; the show can still be watched and enjoyed even with a few gaps in one's knowledge.  That doesn't bother some viewers, and it's true, the box set is a good deal cheaper than a complete set of the individual discs.  But I'm the kind of person who never passes up an opportunity to learn something, and besides, I have a hard time seeing where an extra bit of literature included with the set would have really increased the price all that much.  (I'm also the sort of pedantic viewer who watches each episode in English, then watches it again in the original Japanese with subtitles, just to get the full effect.  That's just the kind of guy I am.)  Again, if that doesn't bother you, by all means buy the boxed set.One more thing: When they rated Azumanga Daioh 13 and up, they weren't kidding; there are some fairly blatant references to alcohol consumption and ""cup size,"" shall we say.  In fact, Kimura's behavior would warrant the 13-up rating all by itself (not to mention getting him fired and probably investigated by the authorities in real life).  So if you're looking for something to entertain the kids, be prepared to answer some fairly uncomfortable questions.  Otherwise, give it a look and prepare to fall in love.  I can pretty much guarantee you will.",5,My favorite anime series of all time!,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,4335,"['Hey', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'almost', '30', ""'m"", 'now', '30', 'still', 'love', 'series', ""'m"", 'also', 'guy', 'Know', 'what', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'love', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'series', 'fall-out-of-your-seat', 'funny', 'touching', 'once', 'packed', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'care', 'even', 'maybe', 'tend', 'remind', 'viewer', 'everybody', 'knew', 'high', 'school', 'Remember', 'one', 'creepy', 'teacher', 'who', 'liked', 'ogle', 'female', 'students', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'hiding', 'Meet', 'Kimura-Sensei', 'psycho', 'chick', 'thought', 'EVERYTHING', 'was', 'competition', 'Tomo', 'girl', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'fat', 'even', 'was', 'as', 'skinny', 'everyone', 'else', 'Yomi', 'so', 'forth', 'fairness', 'though', 'not', 'Kimura', 'bad', 'hiding', 'predilection', 'just', ""n't"", 'care', 'anyone', 'not', 'No', 'wonder', 'male', 'students', 'idolize', 'so', 'something', 'oddly', 'reassuring', 'sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'show', 'realizing', 'even', 'was', 'produced', 'culture', 'roots', 'are', 'alien', 'own', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'actually', 'being', 'Martian', 'STILL', 'just', 'remember', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'jokes', 'make', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'American', 'audience', 'topic', ""'ll"", 'be', 'getting', 'shortly', 'large', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'as', 'hilarious', 'precisely', 'almost', 'everyone', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'way', 'worth', 'noting', 'though', 'none', 'girls', 'ever', 'boyfriend', 'reason', 'ever', 'given', 'Osaka', 'even', 'much', 'one', 'point', 'observation', 'almost', 'completely', 'unnoticed', 'other', 'girls', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'show', 'virtually', 'plot', 'might', 'be', 'sticking', 'point', 'fine', 'Me', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'fussed', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'plot', 'making', 'laugh', 'sometimes', 'cry', 'respect', 'show', 'absolutely', 'wonderfully', 'successful.Which', 'brings', 'only', 'real', 'gripe', 'boxed', 'set', 'are', 'majority', 'are', 'fair', 'number', 'references', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'pop', 'traditional', 'require', 'explaining', 'make', 'sense', 'American', 'audience', 'English', 'dub', 'fair', 'job', 'clearing', 'up', 'are', 'places', 'where', 'even', ""n't"", 'help', ""'re"", 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'individually-released', 'discs', 'include', 'translation', 'cultural', 'notes', 'clear', 'most', 'right', 'up', 'are', 'often', 'pretty', 'funny', 'boot', 'box', 'set', 'bizarre', 'reason', 'none', 'viewer', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'baffled', 'why', 'everyone', 'so', 'frustrated', 'Osaka', 'referring', 'iriomote', 'cat', 'pikanyaa', 'why', 'Osaka', 'holding', 'eggplant', 'hawk', 'when', 'Sakaki', 'New', 'Year', 'dream', 'Not', 'say', 'inexplicable', 'bits', 'center', 'Osaka', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'sprang', 'mind', 'first', 'Okay', 'not', 'earth-shattering', 'show', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'few', 'gaps', 'one', 'knowledge', ""n't"", 'bother', 'viewers', 'true', 'box', 'set', 'good', 'deal', 'cheaper', 'complete', 'set', 'individual', 'discs', ""'m"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'up', 'opportunity', 'learn', 'something', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'seeing', 'where', 'extra', 'bit', 'literature', 'included', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'increased', 'price', 'much', ""'m"", 'also', 'sort', 'pedantic', 'viewer', 'who', 'episode', 'English', 'then', 'again', 'original', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'just', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'just', 'kind', 'guy', 'am', 'Again', ""n't"", 'bother', 'means', 'buy', 'boxed', 'set.One', 'more', 'thing', 'When', 'rated', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', '13', 'up', 'were', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'are', 'fairly', 'blatant', 'references', 'alcohol', 'consumption', 'cup', 'size', 'shall', 'say', 'fact', 'Kimura', 'behavior', 'would', 'warrant', '13-up', 'rating', 'not', 'mention', 'getting', 'fired', 'probably', 'investigated', 'authorities', 'real', 'life', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'entertain', 'kids', 'be', 'prepared', 'answer', 'fairly', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'Otherwise', 'give', 'look', 'prepare', 'fall', 'love', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', 'will']",N/A
926074,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,B000ADKWNM,H. Jin,"[0, 0]","If you think about it, Azumanga Daioh is one of those shows that shouldn't really work. It's simply a group of girls going to high school, with no monsters or giant robots to be fought, and no dark teen angsting and depression. The characters are standard high-school-girl stereotypes: the brainy one, the clueless one, the tall silent type, the brash tomboy, the sporty one, and the self-conscious one.  The anime is very episodic, with little overarching plot and development, and again the episodes are not much different from standard high-school scenarios: culture day, sports day, summer break, etc. What's all the fuss about, you might ask?But it works. It really does.As others have mentioned, I think the series' very simplicity is its greatest asset. At its heart, `Azumanga' is a slice-of-life comedy, able to find humour in even the most mundane situations. It's mostly the ditzy, airheaded Osaka, child genius Chiyo, and the brash Tomo who take the comedic lead, although two running jokes involving Sakaki dominate the series. The two female teachers, particularly Yukari, complement the cast with their restless immaturity, while Kimura gets some laughs as the hopelessly perverted male teacher.There are a couple of caveats, however. Firstly, a lot of the humour relies heavily on Japanese culture, and without at least some basic knowledge of Japan, some of the jokes fall flat. The translators for the English sub and dub do a heroic job of interpreting the various idioms, in-jokes and cultural references for a Western audience, but occasionally the original just can't translate (e.g. the `haemorrhoid' joke). Secondly, despite this being a slice-of-life comedy, there is some quite surreal humour at times, which may not be to everyone's taste (e.g. the New Year Dream sequence). Finally, a couple of the gags are done to death, endlessly repeated until they're not really funny anymore (yes, we GET that Kaorin likes Sakaki!).It's not for everyone, but provided you can accept a few jokes missing the mark or going over your head, this is a really enjoyable little comedy. With the trend nowadays seemingly towards darker, artier, and self-consciously ""difficult"" anime, it's refreshing to view something that as light-hearted and fun as `Azumanga Daioh'.",4,It works....,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,2278,"['think', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'one', 'shows', 'should', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'simply', 'group', 'girls', 'going', 'high', 'school', 'monsters', 'giant', 'robots', 'be', 'fought', 'dark', 'teen', 'angsting', 'depression', 'characters', 'are', 'standard', 'high-school-girl', 'stereotypes', 'brainy', 'one', 'clueless', 'one', 'tall', 'silent', 'type', 'brash', 'tomboy', 'sporty', 'one', 'self-conscious', 'one', 'anime', 'very', 'episodic', 'little', 'overarching', 'plot', 'development', 'again', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'standard', 'high-school', 'scenarios', 'culture', 'day', 'sports', 'day', 'summer', 'break', 'etc', 'What', 'fuss', 'might', 'ask', 'really', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'think', 'series', 'very', 'simplicity', 'greatest', 'asset', 'heart', 'Azumanga', 'slice-of-life', 'comedy', 'able', 'find', 'humour', 'even', 'most', 'mundane', 'situations', 'mostly', 'ditzy', 'airheaded', 'Osaka', 'child', 'genius', 'Chiyo', 'brash', 'Tomo', 'who', 'take', 'comedic', 'lead', 'two', 'running', 'jokes', 'involving', 'Sakaki', 'dominate', 'series', 'two', 'female', 'teachers', 'particularly', 'Yukari', 'complement', 'cast', 'restless', 'immaturity', 'Kimura', 'laughs', 'hopelessly', 'perverted', 'male', 'are', 'couple', 'caveats', 'however', 'Firstly', 'lot', 'humour', 'heavily', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'least', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'Japan', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'translators', 'English', 'sub', 'dub', 'do', 'heroic', 'job', 'interpreting', 'various', 'idioms', 'in-jokes', 'cultural', 'references', 'Western', 'audience', 'occasionally', 'original', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'translate', 'e.g', 'haemorrhoid', 'joke', 'Secondly', 'being', 'slice-of-life', 'comedy', 'quite', 'surreal', 'humour', 'times', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'e.g', 'New', 'Year', 'Dream', 'sequence', 'Finally', 'couple', 'gags', 'are', 'done', 'death', 'endlessly', 'repeated', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'funny', 'anymore', 'yes', 'GET', 'Kaorin', 'Sakaki', '.It', 'not', 'everyone', 'provided', 'can', 'accept', 'few', 'jokes', 'missing', 'mark', 'going', 'head', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'comedy', 'trend', 'seemingly', 'towards', 'darker', 'artier', 'self-consciously', 'difficult', 'anime', 'refreshing', 'view', 'something', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh']",N/A

Actually, this is a series about how schoolgirls can overcome the hardships of high school through their humorous gags and jokes.The show begins with simple gags based on the characters, who are hilarious themselves. Chiyo, the child prodigy is so unbearably cute. Sakaki appears to be a cool, athletic girl, but she also wears kitty underwear and she tries to pet every cat she sees. Osaka is an airhead who can't help sleeping in class. Tomo is the loud girl who raises her hand in class just to say that she doesn't know the answer. Yomi just tags along.While all these character-based gags may get very repetitive (especially by episode 15), this is one of the few series in which the characters discover their own talents based on their goofy habits. Chiyo becomes a busybody cheerleader of the class and Sakaki learns to take care of animals. And, of course, they all take the dreaded college entrance exams.This series really grew on me. I liked how the characters grew up and discovered themselves. Some Americans may not like Kaori's crush on Sakaki or the creepy male teacher who loves schoolgirls, but overall, this is an anime for all ages. This is a great anime about schoolgirls whose hilarious jokes can overcome any difficult situation.The only disappointment about this release is that there are no extras. I would have liked the clean opening and ending animation.

It's well High School. It focuses on the most extreme of characters. Osaka is rather spacey, and instead of her being just spacey she is oblivious...to...nearly everything. Then Yomi the girl who is self conscious about herself always trying to maintain her weight. She is fairly normal and often tires of the group for there immaturity but loves them none the less. Chiyo-chan is well she is the smart kid. But remember this is based on extremes so instead of her being just the smart one. She is a child preteen prodigy who is 11 skipped multiple grades and ended in highschool. There is also the love stricken yuri girl and the tall dark mysterious girl( Who LOVES ANIMALS BEYOND ANY WORDS yet every cat seems to bit her). And the teacher with the maturity of a twelve year old. This is just a show based on funny scenarios and one liners. The beginning of the series was rough to accept it seemed to well...childish. Keep in mind I'm nineteen but threw the series I either got used to it or it got better.There really isn't a way to describe this show...it's cute it's funny. It shows what friendship and innocence really is like. I would really suggest the manga. It's a four panel manga slide kinds like the daily funnies in the post dispatch. They translated it to be more American cultured and some of the things that stay Japanese cultured they explain in either foot notes or in the back of the books. It made the anime a little bit easier to understand become some things seem very random but later on I fond out they do serve a purpose.The animation is not the best but it really does suit this anime the most. It's not that the animation sucks it's just I am not a fan of it....but it really does suit this anime.

926082,A11S26M1MUM7O7,B000ADKWNM,Neil Ford,"[5, 7]","Azumanga Daioh is a hard show to talk about. It's been highly praised by many people, but there doesn't actually seem to be much substance to it. It's not very dramatic (except in a childish way), and there aren't any deep themes (except, of course, for ""growing up""). And Japanese humour can be extremely corny!I think the real appeal is the characters, who we get to know and have strong feelings about (positive or negative) through accumulation of detail. Indeed, a strong plot would have worked against this and produced quite a different show. (Full Metal Panic, perhaps?)It's a measure of this show's quality that we can feel so strongly about these fictional girls, having our favourite characters (Yomi for me) and least favourite characters (Tomo, of course!). In this respect, the show has some strange imbalances which I think are quite revealing:Kaorin, with her heavy crush on Sakaki, starts as one of the gang, but begins to be moved to the sidelines after a couple of episodes, and is basically a cameo part by the time of the first summer break. Kagura emerges as her replacement. Mr Kimura, the lecherous teacher, is by mid-season just generally weird. I suspect that the producers or the original manga creator weren't happy with the potential sexual aspects of the show, and insisted on some changes. The period where it seems to be becoming ""The Sakaki Show"" is where they were course-correcting the show, and probably putting in a few extra late nights!The ending still feels a bit like a let-down, but I guess that's in keeping with the nature of the show. On the other hand, without heavy plot-points weighing it down, it's easy to rewatch, starting from any episode you choose. My only real complaint is that, instead of having their whole high school careers fitted into one season, they could have spun it out with a season for each school year!Sub or dub? I prefer the original Japanese voice-actors, but am currently rewatching with the US dub, and finding that the humour works better if you don't have to read all the time.

Out of all 5 discs, i still think the first disc is my favorite.Which puts a little focus on the girl CHIO-CHAN...the bright 10 year old who gets to go to school with the big highschool kids. Shes not the main character, no one really is the main character, theres other girls in it, but Chio Chan gave me an adorably hilarious and strangly enjoyable first impression of the the whole azumanga world.The humor is really good, and odd, but the people who wrote this have true talent to make a person laugh...nothing is forced and nothing really trys too hard. It can be very strange and just funny as heck.Some people try to do the whole ""stupid random""  humor and just try to hard and its lame. But this show knows how to do it like few can.The show i like more than this would have to be CROMARTIE HIGHSCHOOL, which i personally relate to more and i personally love to watch.This show and that one totally changed my entire outlook on ADV films.In short, this series about a group of girls who go to school, and their teachers, and everyone is pretty quirky and weird and funny. Each girl has their own personality. And for the most part, all the girls are likable.Theres also this weirdo male teacher that allways crazily stares at the girls of the school, and i guess hes kinda a creepy perv, but he doesnt do anything disgusting...just creepy...yet very funny at times.The show is just about the random happenings involving the girls at school and stuff, and behind all the crazy hilariousness and repetitive random strange stupidity, theres a little bit of heart behind the series.Just a little bit...but the show allways reminds ya to laugh soon.I liked the voices for the characters, someone you might recognise from other series or anime movies. I recognise one from Pokemon and Project A-ko. I like Chio-Chan and the southern sounding girls voices most. Cuz theyre the funniest to me.The animation is real good, melds computer graphics and animation real well. The CG really expresses things more vividly then ever before.And in this series it looks really fresh. I liked the animation.Its worth buying becouse its really really funny, and therea A LOT of anime out there...and i think it can be hard to find a memorable, loveable anime series, becouse anime these days is SOOOO saturated with mediocre series. But this is a grade A.I only gave it 4 stars becouse i personally didnt love this that much, but its very good and worth watching if your looking to finally find a quality anime series thats very hilarious and very very CUTE at times.At times i think the creators were obsessed and highly aware of the series cuteness, they dont hide it haha.Again, this is one of the very very few anime series/box sets id actually buy.

You might say these sort of anime shows are nothing more than cute girls doing cute things cutely. Azumanga Daioh is about five high school girls who have nothing in common with each other until 10 year old child prodigy Chiyo-chan is put into their class. Chiyo becomes the glue that pulls and holds this goofy group of girls together as they deal with mid-terms, vacations, their teachers and, ultimately, college entrance exams and the certain knowledge that their graduation will spell the end of their special group as they all go their separate ways. The graduation episode had me remembering the end of my own high school days with fondness and even a few tears in my eyes. Unlike the manga, which I also own, I had no trouble in the videos in telling the girls apart, one from the other. This is a superior production for ADV.

A great show about kids growing up and enjoying life together. One of the few anime series that I liked all the characters.

926088,A23BUUV8D8W0R7,B000ADKWNM,S. E. Horne,"[3, 3]","For a show about six girls going through high school, you'd think it would get boring very fast. But with diverse characters and off-beat hilarity, you can't go wrong with Azumanga Daioh.First of al, there are a couple things you shouldn't expect from this show. Don't expect a riveting plot...because there isn't one. It's just six girls through three years of high school. Don't expect fan service just because it's about girls. There's very little, if any at all.Despite lacking the essentials that would ruin any other show, the lack of these things makes this show so unique and interesting. You watch the girls grow and go through normal (and most of the time, abnormal) teen situations. On some level, everyone can compare themselves to these girls.This is a great show to just sit and enjoy any time. The jokes are fresh and funny, all the characters are unique and memorable, and best of all, the show seems to understand its utter pointlessness and never tries to preach to you. On one level it's a heart-warming look into the mind of a teenage girl. On another, it's a hilarious comedy that you really can't compare to anything else. Go into this show with no expectations and you'll come out with a lot more than you bargained for.",5,a masterpiece...about nothing,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,1243,"['show', 'six', 'girls', 'going', 'high', 'school', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'get', 'boring', 'very', 'fast', 'diverse', 'characters', 'off-beat', 'hilarity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh.First', 'al', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'riveting', 'plot', ""n't"", 'one', 'just', 'six', 'girls', 'three', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fan', 'service', 'just', 'girls', 'very', 'little', 'all.Despite', 'lacking', 'essentials', 'would', 'ruin', 'other', 'show', 'lack', 'things', 'show', 'so', 'unique', 'interesting', 'watch', 'girls', 'grow', 'go', 'normal', 'most', 'time', 'abnormal', 'teen', 'situations', 'level', 'everyone', 'can', 'compare', 'girls.This', 'great', 'show', 'just', 'sit', 'enjoy', 'time', 'jokes', 'are', 'fresh', 'funny', 'characters', 'are', 'unique', 'memorable', 'best', 'show', 'understand', 'utter', 'pointlessness', 'never', 'tries', 'preach', 'one', 'level', 'heart-warming', 'look', 'mind', 'teenage', 'girl', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'anything', 'else', 'Go', 'show', 'expectations', ""'ll"", 'come', 'out', 'lot', 'more', 'bargained']",N/A
926089,ABVULUZ2ILKKO,B000ADKWNM,Stephen Ressel,"[6, 8]","There isn't anything quite like it.I don't know the origin of the series (comics, etc), or where this idea found its voice, but this is one of those few anime that rises above the mass of gorey, sex driven, gun battling, robot punching, missile attacking, blood bath, emotionally tormented animation that comes from Japan.  Even better, the drawings are so simple and at most times beautifully animated.  The quality is all around superb.Dealing with the lives of 8 or 9 girls/women (students/teachers), and one odd man across 3 years in a Tokyo high school, it spins very quaint, fragmented yarns of behavior and misbehavior among a clique of 'go-home club' girls (people who belong to no specific after school activities).  Excellent family entertainment, it lacks in only one way - it is slow.  This is nice, easy going tv entertainment with stories loosely based within episodes, or segments of episodes, and also resonating across episodes.See them try to figure out life, learning, themselves.  As they debate who is smarter, or stronger, go to an amusement park, go on beach vacations in summer, try to discern goofy Japanese traditions and expectations, and then graduate, it gives a nice, pedestrian entertainment that isn't so wrapped up in the eye candy and crotch foolery of most modern entertainment.  Instead, it deals on a very pleasant level of simple character reaction to silly, common experiences.  Amazingly, boys, nor boy lusts, never enter into their lives during this series.  Instead it is very craftily subverted into one character as problematic associations with cats about the town.Azumanga, despite the pacing and loose story structure, ranks as one of the best anime on the market.  The catchy, silly animation at points seems to be favorite avatar material for lots of people on the internet, proving the creative integrity and grip of this surprisingly simple series.The dub is excellent, compared to much of the American dubbing of anime.

What about teachers that bicker like they are 10 year olds because you don't want them to join you on your summer vacation? Well if you don't then you need to see the show 'Azumanga Daioh'If there is one thing that can be said about Japanesse animation is they know how to deliver a great comedy that is so outragious yet so real and relatable at the same time. This is the story about five high school friends and a brand new student named Chio, oh and she is a 10 year old super genius who can almost anything. She is welcomed into the the group and each one of them has their own special characteristics. Sakaki: A very tall and silent girl who is extremly helpful, but has a strange obsession with cats. Tomo: a hyper and overcompetative goof-up. Kagura: A sassy superstar athelete, but can't pass a test to save her life. Nyomi: A book worm who is very worrysome about herself, but will always help a friend. Osaka: A space case as out there as they come. These girls get into everything from putting together high school culture fairs, taking trips to the beach or just cramming away at the books and never getting any work done. Some of the moments in the show are so outlandish you can't do anything but laugh. Each character is so different from the next that each one has something that keeps the show strong from the first episode to the last. The end of the show will defintly pull at your heartstrings reminding you of how you felt when you were graduating high school. This show is one you should see because it will definitely leave an impression and if not will definitely make you feel good.",5,Was High School Ever This Nutty?,1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,1701,"['What', 'can', 'remember', 'days', 'high', 'school', 'Do', 'remember', 'crazy', 'sports', 'competitions', 'What', 'teachers', 'bicker', 'are', '10', 'year', 'olds', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'join', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'then', 'need', 'see', 'show', ""Daioh'If"", 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Japanesse', 'animation', 'know', 'how', 'deliver', 'great', 'comedy', 'so', 'outragious', 'yet', 'so', 'real', 'relatable', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'five', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'brand', 'new', 'student', 'named', 'Chio', 'oh', '10', 'year', 'old', 'super', 'genius', 'who', 'can', 'almost', 'anything', 'welcomed', 'group', 'one', 'own', 'special', 'characteristics', 'Sakaki', 'very', 'tall', 'silent', 'girl', 'who', 'extremly', 'helpful', 'strange', 'obsession', 'cats', 'Tomo', 'hyper', 'overcompetative', 'goof-up', 'Kagura', 'sassy', 'superstar', 'athelete', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'test', 'save', 'life', 'Nyomi', 'book', 'worm', 'who', 'very', 'worrysome', 'will', 'always', 'help', 'friend', 'Osaka', 'space', 'case', 'out', 'there', 'come', 'girls', 'get', 'everything', 'putting', 'together', 'high', 'school', 'culture', 'fairs', 'taking', 'trips', 'beach', 'just', 'cramming', 'away', 'books', 'never', 'getting', 'work', 'done', 'moments', 'show', 'are', 'so', 'outlandish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'laugh', 'character', 'so', 'different', 'next', 'one', 'something', 'show', 'strong', 'first', 'episode', 'last', 'end', 'show', 'will', 'defintly', 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'reminding', 'how', 'felt', 'when', 'were', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'show', 'one', 'should', 'see', 'will', 'definitely', 'leave', 'impression', 'not', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'feel', 'good']",N/A
