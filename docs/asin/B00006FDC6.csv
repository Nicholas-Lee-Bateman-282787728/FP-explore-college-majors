The lead characters played by Lark & Kadeem had such great chemistry and comedic timing.  Tempest as Larks best friend and party did a very good job.  It was nice to see her grow from the Cosby Show.  The perky actress that played the customer service rep. was priceless.  The story is about a daughter trying to live up to her ambitious political father (Glenn Turman) and step-mother's (Freda Payne)expectations while trying to make a life of her own.  This is complicated by her ex-fiance being caught in a very public scandal.  Things get even crazier when, Lark ends up making a service call to a very irate customer (Kadeem)of their high tech security system company.  Let the roller coaster ride begin!!

Largely, because a lot of the good African-American movies are right here, and not in the theaters. It really does surprise me a whole lot. Nevertheless, there is just a lot of excitement in these movies that Arabesque and BET developed, most of them anyway. There have been so many good movies that were made including A Private Affair with Vanessa Bell, the very deep and understanding After All with Holly Robinson Peete, and some other well known ones just like the depths of Fire & Ice.The 2001 film Fire & Ice, showcases the surprising love story of a well-recognized talk show host, played by Kadeem Hardison from A Different World fame, and a high ranking daughter of a politican, Holly Ames, played by Lark Vorhies from the hit teen show Saved By The Bell. The story is about two worlds that are matching, that sometimes get in the way of their own careers. Kadeem's character wants to fall in love with Holly Ames, but often gets placed back into the spotlight by his well enforced, demanding career. Within this love affair, he considers popping the question, but Holly decides to refuse the proposal, but under the pressure of her friends, and his well recieevd public feelings from a television plea on the talk show Kadeem performs on. Holly steps into the spotlight, and says yes. This film does show that love can be among strange positions.All in all, Fire & Ice is a delightful film, and is just wonderful to watch. If you have seen this film on BET before, you may want to rent this, buy it on DVD or tape it from BET if it airs again. If not, see this delightful love story for yourself beyond the hearts of fire & ice.",4,Love In The Spotlight,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,1752,"['really', 'have', 'taken', 'real', 'wonderful', 'interest', 'lot', 'movies', 'were', 'showcased', 'BET', 'quite', 'awhile', 'Largely', 'lot', 'good', 'African-American', 'movies', 'are', 'right', 'here', 'not', 'theaters', 'really', 'surprise', 'whole', 'lot', 'Nevertheless', 'just', 'lot', 'excitement', 'movies', 'Arabesque', 'BET', 'developed', 'most', 'anyway', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'including', 'A', 'Private', 'Affair', 'Vanessa', 'Bell', 'very', 'deep', 'understanding', 'Holly', 'Robinson', 'Peete', 'other', 'well', 'known', 'ones', 'just', 'depths', 'Fire', 'Ice.The', '2001', 'film', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'surprising', 'love', 'story', 'well-recognized', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'played', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'A', 'Different', 'World', 'fame', 'high', 'ranking', 'daughter', 'politican', 'Holly', 'Ames', 'played', 'Lark', 'Vorhies', 'hit', 'teen', 'show', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'story', 'two', 'worlds', 'are', 'matching', 'get', 'way', 'own', 'careers', 'Kadeem', 'character', 'fall', 'love', 'Holly', 'Ames', 'often', 'placed', 'back', 'spotlight', 'well', 'enforced', 'demanding', 'career', 'love', 'affair', 'popping', 'question', 'Holly', 'refuse', 'proposal', 'pressure', 'friends', 'well', 'public', 'feelings', 'television', 'plea', 'talk', 'show', 'Kadeem', 'Holly', 'spotlight', 'yes', 'film', 'show', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'strange', 'positions.All', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'delightful', 'film', 'just', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'BET', 'may', 'want', 'rent', 'buy', 'DVD', 'tape', 'BET', 'again', 'not', 'see', 'delightful', 'love', 'story', 'hearts', 'fire', 'ice']",N/A

Holly's (Lark Voorhies, Saved by the Bell) father (Glynn Turman, A Different World) is running for Senate and she is trying to keep scandal out of her life so it does not bring negative press to her fathers campaign.  Holly finds out her boyfriend Trey has been arrested and had drugs on him.  She also finds out he married another woman.  She is devastated and decides to throw herself into her work swearing off men.  Holly and her business partner Pam (Tempest Bledsoe, The Cosby Show) are hoping to expand their business with a deal that will open a Tampa office.  Holly arrives at work one Saturday and finds out she has to deal with a difficult client.  Holly and assistant Wanda go to Williams (Kadeem Hardison), and he yells and berates them for the problems he has incurred since having the alarm installed in his home.  Holly is not impressed with his belligerent behavior.  Holly finds out the specs of his house changed, which caused the alarm to go off.  Michael realizes he has to apologize, and he also sees meeting Holly as an opportunity to hopefully get Holly and her ex Trey on his talk show.  Michael manages to woo Wanda, but Holly is not trying to be seen with Michael.  She promised she would stay out of trouble.  Holly watches his talk show, and finds him to be funny, and charming.  Michael sends her a cute Teddy Bear, but she returns it.  On the show he says ""Ladies, if a  man sends you a teddy bear or something like it don't send it back."" His persistence pays off and they start to see each other.  Holly feels her resistance melt more and more and she finds herself falling for Michael and it feels good.When Holly's brother Robert (Ron Reaco Lee Sister Sister, The Shield) finds out she is dating Michael Williams he says ""Michael Williams changes women like he changes his socks.""  Having dinner one night her family finds Holly with Michael and they end up having dinner together.  Michael is interrogated, and Holly's grandmother threatens him with bodily harm if he breaks her grandbabies heart.  There is a cute scene of Michael being scared of being on a Ferris wheel.  Michael is feeling guilty about booking Trey on the show and can't bring himself to tell her what he did, and he hopes he can fix it before it's too late.  Holly finds out that Trey was booked on the show and she is furious with Michael and decides she can't trust him with her heart and feelings.  Michael is remorseful and wants to marry Holly, but she is not trying to hear it.  Holly wants to confront Michael one more time about breaking her heart, but she hears his speech to the audience and realizes she can trust him.  This is around the time I always find myself holding my heart and reaching for my box of tissue.Fire and Ice is a wonderful love story.  Michael is the Fire that has to melt the Ice around Holly's heart.  The movie is about learning to love again after being  burned.
