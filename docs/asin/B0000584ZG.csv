This film really shows Zellweger's incredible range as an actress, she can play any kind role. Nurse Betty is the story of a woman who witnesses her husband getting murdered and then warps into a world of delusion, she falls for a soap opera actor played by Greg Kinnear. She truly believes his character is real and she will stop at nothing until she can be with her hunky crush. The plot seems far-fetched but this film works, it can be violent at times but I enjoyed Nurse Betty and hopefully so will you.

571740,A1AHFIGBYPZTXC,B0000584ZG,Amazon Customer,"[0, 5]","There are rip offs and then there are rip offs. And when you steal from the masters, it's usually a very visible theft. Nurse Betty, while not falling for the more conventional traps completely, does make it's roots very evident.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger plays the title role, a mousy Kansas waitress married to a scumbag car salesman who, unbeknownst to her, is dealing drugs as a sideline. When she inadvertently witnesses his brutal murder, it causes a psychotic split that convinces her that she's actually the old flame of her favorite soap opera character Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). She leaves the scene of the crime in a haze to go find him and it's not long before the murderers are hot on her trail.Now you have to give the plot credit for originality but there are just so many problems in the execution that originality alone is not enough to save it. In that respect it reminds me of last year's Being John Malkovich (although not as original as that - what is?). The film is basically split into two threads - Betty finding her fictional lover and the killers who are after her. That second thread reveals problems early on.Morgan Freeman plays the seasoned hit man showing the new kid, Chris Rock, the ropes. Their story opens with the sort of banter that Tarantino is known for and evolves into a direct lift from the Coen Brothers bickering bad guys a la Fargo. Freeman plays it with some panache as a smooth old timer looking to retire and finding that he's falling for his target but Rock, in a very uncharacteristic turn, is nothing but screaming anger and complaining throughout the film. I don't know how general audiences will take his latest character, but to this viewer he became a grating harpy real fast. I just don't like seeing a decent comedic actor scalping his victims and roaring with rage in every single scene. There's got to be a human being in there somewhere.The whole story of Betty however is the real point of originality here. I wish writers James Flamberg and John C. Richards had stuck to this and allowed the character to develop more fully. Her soap opera obsession is shared by most of the people she meets along her journey and there's certainly some good parody to be had on the small screen. Zellweger turns out possibly the best performance of her career in such a sweet, low key way that you just can't help but root for her and after traveling across the country, the scene where she finally meets the object of her affection makes the whole film worthwhile.Unfortunately that's the high point in a movie that borrows too liberally from the aforementioned bastions of '90s film. If someone like Tarantino, the Coen brothers or maybe even the Farrellys (There's Something About Mary) had this production, they could keep it interesting and manage to tie the whole thing together. As it is, Nurse Betty is as schizophrenically split as it's title character. Combining violence and comedy is a tricky thing to handle and if you don't do it well, it's too easy to fall into the cracks of those who do.",2,Theft and madness with a dash of originality,976492800,"12 11, 2000",2000,3053,"['are', 'rip', 'offs', 'then', 'are', 'rip', 'offs', 'when', 'steal', 'masters', 'usually', 'very', 'visible', 'theft', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'not', 'falling', 'more', 'conventional', 'traps', 'completely', 'make', 'roots', 'very', 'evident.Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'title', 'role', 'mousy', 'Kansas', 'waitress', 'married', 'scumbag', 'car', 'salesman', 'who', 'unbeknownst', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'sideline', 'When', 'inadvertently', 'brutal', 'murder', 'psychotic', 'split', 'actually', 'old', 'flame', 'favorite', 'soap', 'opera', 'character', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Ravell', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'scene', 'crime', 'haze', 'go', 'find', 'not', 'long', 'murderers', 'are', 'hot', 'trail.Now', 'have', 'give', 'plot', 'credit', 'originality', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'execution', 'originality', 'alone', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'respect', 'last', 'year', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'not', 'as', 'original', 'what', 'film', 'basically', 'split', 'two', 'threads', 'Betty', 'finding', 'fictional', 'lover', 'killers', 'who', 'are', 'second', 'thread', 'reveals', 'problems', 'early', 'on.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'seasoned', 'hit', 'man', 'showing', 'new', 'kid', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'ropes', 'story', 'sort', 'banter', 'Tarantino', 'known', 'direct', 'lift', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'bickering', 'bad', 'guys', 'la', 'Fargo', 'Freeman', 'panache', 'smooth', 'old', 'timer', 'looking', 'retire', 'finding', 'falling', 'target', 'Rock', 'very', 'uncharacteristic', 'turn', 'nothing', 'screaming', 'anger', 'complaining', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'general', 'audiences', 'will', 'take', 'latest', 'character', 'viewer', 'became', 'grating', 'harpy', 'real', 'fast', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'decent', 'comedic', 'actor', 'scalping', 'victims', 'roaring', 'rage', 'single', 'scene', 'got', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'somewhere.The', 'whole', 'story', 'Betty', 'however', 'real', 'point', 'originality', 'here', 'wish', 'writers', 'James', 'Flamberg', 'John', 'C.', 'Richards', 'had', 'stuck', 'allowed', 'character', 'develop', 'more', 'fully', 'soap', 'opera', 'obsession', 'shared', 'most', 'people', 'journey', 'certainly', 'good', 'parody', 'be', 'had', 'small', 'screen', 'Zellweger', 'out', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'such', 'sweet', 'low', 'key', 'way', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'traveling', 'country', 'scene', 'where', 'finally', 'object', 'affection', 'whole', 'film', 'worthwhile.Unfortunately', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'too', 'liberally', 'aforementioned', 'bastions', ""'90s"", 'film', 'someone', 'Tarantino', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'maybe', 'even', 'Farrellys', 'Something', 'Mary', 'had', 'production', 'could', 'keep', 'interesting', 'manage', 'tie', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'schizophrenically', 'split', 'title', 'character', 'Combining', 'violence', 'comedy', 'tricky', 'thing', 'handle', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'too', 'easy', 'fall', 'cracks', 'who', 'do']",N/A

Ye gods !First of all, this is the purist of anathema to any veteran of combat duty. Remaining focused on evil after evil, torture after torture...is anything BUT entertainment. Is IS torture. Hence the reason for the title of my review, ""gratuitous torture""...""give the sick puppies what they want - after all, this is about the almighty dollar, isn't it?""...""To Hell with redeeming social values""? ( phew.)What makes this movie NOT work, is the expectation that an actor we all admire, and an actress we admire, and a comic we may not admire, but maybe even recoil from in disgust...are so out of character here. Oh there's plenty of disgust alright. The opening scenes of torture and murder is one that will NEVER leave your mind. One of the few  ""comic reliefs"" in the script is when, in a storm of frustration over the mindless cruelty, and bungling ineptitude of his ""son"" in the script, Chris Rock, Morgan freman rakes Chris over the coals for his whole ""shtick"", that is to say, his  vile, and profane comedy career, as doing nothing much more than ""...drag the entire country down"".Bravo Monseur Freeman!For a time, I took an interest in Japanese produced movies...until I discovered that there, too, the modus operandi is also to leave you with a disturbing image that you will NEVER forget.I am aware that there are a large number of folks, if not the majority, who revel in ""being profoundly disturbed"".  Psychologists have explained this phenomena as something common among adolescents...who, privately,-not even aware of it themselves -  are ""innoculating themselves against fear"".I'm quite serious. Any of you who have served in combat, are acutely aware of the widespread commonality of torture as THE method of gathering intelligence on the ""enemy"". These sorts of movies are definitly not amusing or entertaining in any way, shape or form.Thus I warn anyone who thinks that ""Nurse Betty"", and great actors, and a well known ""comic""...spell ""amusing, and entertaining situation comedy"".It is simply ""formulaic"" script writing. Anyone with a room temerature IQ could write such a script. These actors deserve better.One wonders why on earth actors of this calibre even agree to such a vomit of  a story.

571746,AHKOPVTQ3IEBL,B0000584ZG,"Baltic Books ""Vic""","[4, 4]","If you liked Fargo, Magnolia, and perhaps Jackie Brown, you're going to also enjoy &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; as a film continuing the present trend in creative storylines.  Neil LaBute can join the Coen brothers as a director who mastered the combination of humor noir, infatuation, pain and a bit of gore with a satirical look at soap operas and all of us that find escape through them. You could say this is a Fargo-styled &quot;date flick&quot;... almost.Renee Zellweger's basically plays the same really sweet-girl-looks-for-Price-Charming role you'll remember from &quot;Jerry McGuire&quot;. In this film she attempts to deal with a bizarre and tragic series of events spawned initially from her marriage to a loser car salesman (Aaron Eckhart).  Betty's favorite hospital soap opera offers the singular daily escape from her own marriage and dead-end life.  All that hyper-jumps to the surreal when she witnesses a gruesome murder. The result is a wild ride as Betty departs town... and reality, as her sole means to cope through living out the soap.Greg Kinnear plays the target of Betty's obsession as a seemingly sensitive but actually self-absorbed love interest, much as he did in &quot;Sabrina&quot;. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are an unlikely father-and-son hit team after Betty.  Freeman does a great job mirroring Betty's fantasy with his own obsession of her, making for an interesting twist and ending to Betty's experience.The result is an entertaining ensemble film touching home with our own occasional forays into fantasy.I would have given this film four stars except for writer's and director's inability (or Chris Rock's unwillingness) to develop humor apart from voluminous profanities.  The only redeeming factor in it was the contrast it built between &quot;class&quot; and &quot;crass&quot; when Freeman and Rock stood side by side.

It's too bad Renee changed too much since her naivete in this silly film within a film.  Lots of things have changed in six or seven years -- I know I have, that's for sure.  When I found this tape, I was shocked, thinking either I have changed or watching it in a theater added a bit of magic lacking on the tape.  Nobody is that un-sophisticated.  Perhaps her ""unknowing"" character was the story (may be every girl's fantasy) takes her on a journey into the world of soap operas.  She was too sweet to be true.  We don't all get what we wish for; this is a modern fairytale like 'Born Yesterday.'Here, now, is Wink's ""A Reason to Love.""  He must have found this same tape in April out there when he accused another Betty of creating a soap opera.  Chuck is no Greg Kinnear.  All Bettys are not so dumb as to travel to California while in a dream state caused by Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  She becomes the character and fascinates Dr. David as she dresses like a nurse and successfully lands a job in a real hospital.Betty was damaged emotionally by the sight of her real-life, abusive husband after he was savagely murdered.  Suddenly, she's free to be herself and spend some time in fairy land out in Los Angeles.  They found her charming and relentless, but she is not a Southerner.  After a foray into a world she does not understand, she lost her spontenanity and is devastated when her idol proves to be less than a god -- when he calls her crazy or deranged.  Later, he changes his mind.  Greg Kinnear is as handsome in this role as our George Clooney, only better.  She had told him ""If you were any handsomer, it'd be a crime; it's too bad you're such an -------.""He inadvertendly sends Del's killers to her before she can safely get away in the car which has their drugs in the trunk.  The publicity of the ordeal at which both father and son murderers died gained her dream come true.  She and David were together for sixty-three episodes.

571752,A168Z6F8T9283S,B0000584ZG,bobjsmith,"[2, 6]","Been a lot of talk about the &quot;originality&quot; and &quot;freshness&quot; of this movie, Neil Labute's first as director only (he scripted his first two films, as well as directing.) But I'm here to give you the low down.It's stupid.I had reservations before actually seeing the film. I'd read about it. Much was made of it's unique plot -- and being fond of Labute, I honestly wanted it to be cool -- but there was a persistant, nagging voice at the back of my head, saying: &quot;It's a dumb idea. Sure, it's original ... I guess ... but it just won't work. It's silly.&quot;How let down I was that Neil and the rest of the team couldn't prove that voice wrong!The movie has its merits. For at least the first third of the movie, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are a genuine hoot, although the humor is dark, and sometimes subtle. Aaron Eckhart ... well ... I just like seeing him turn up in films in general, no matter how small the role. And Zellweger pulls off the naive charm of her character well.But these things aside, it's more or less a big mess. First of all, the story is entirely unbelievable. Accidentally seeing her husband murdered (let's leave aside that the murder itself feels rather awkward in the context of the movie for now), Betty &quot;snaps&quot; and loses herself in her own internal fantasy world, which is constructed from her favorite soap opera, which happened to be on TV at the time.Uh. Yeah. Let's just say this didn't quite &quot;ring true&quot; to me.But it only gets worse. Betty &quot;accidentally&quot; succeeding in becoming a nurse? And then &quot;accidentally&quot; wooing David Ravell, her favorite soap star, by way of some wacky misunderstandings? Ack. This is the kind of story progression usually reserved for sitcoms. But what's even worse is that it's not very funny. It's just sort of ... odd ... and entirely unbelievable.I sense that we, as an audience, are supposed to &quot;let that go&quot; or be liberal in &quot;suspending reality,&quot; because we are supposed to be won over by Betty's innocent, unknowing, uncalculated sweetness, and the magical way it makes everything just sort of happen around her. But to me this just worsened the film's situation. Because now it not only resembled an unfunny sitcom, but a B-grade inspirational children's movie as well.Betty isn't the only problem, though. Morgan Freeman, who starts strong, really loses his flare in the second half as he &quot;falls&quot; for Betty. It just doesn't make any sense in regards to his character, and the film doesn't bother to try to make this change of heart convincing. The rapport with Chris Rock -- which, again, started strong -- falters and loses punch, and by the final half-hour of the movie, it is very difficult to accept the pair as cold-blooded hit men, or ... as much of anything, really. They come off as wasted characters who gradually became obscure and uninteresting throughout the course of the scattershot script.Then there is the climax, after Betty has &quot;come to&quot; (um ... ok) and has been located by the hitmen. It's supposed to be rousing and funny and touching all at once, putting all of the characters who have been on Betty's tail in one room together and having fun with that. But it isn't fun, mainly because none of these characters have been developed in a particularly believable way, and they consequently have no chemistry together.&lt;Sigh.&gt; And that's pretty much that. The only scene in the last two-thirds of the film that came anywhere close to having some real meat was the scene in which Greg Kinnear's character &quot;disillusions&quot; Betty ... it even smacked remotely of &quot;Chad's&quot; scene with Stacy Edwards at the climax of Labute's first movie, &quot;In the Company of Men.&quot; But this is hardly enough to make up for the other 100+ minutes.Can't recommend this one in good conscience, I'm afraid.

I thought &quot;In The Company of Men&quot; was a stunning film but I would hardly turn it on after a hard day's work when I really needed to relax. Yes, this very same director has made a 3rd movie that I could actually like and enjoy; laugh even!  I wouldn't have believed he was capable of doing something not vitrolic.  For awhile, while watching this, I thought he'd gone all the way in the other direction and this was going to take every predictible Hollywood turn. He didn't go that route, Thank God. He pairs Zellwegger with the most unpleasant husband imaginable (the lead from &quot;In The Company of Men&quot;) and then has hubby disposed of by two hit men. Zellwegger's character, Betty, experiences post traumatic stress syndrome since she witnessed the murder.  She becomes, in her own mind, a character, Nurse Betty, on her favorite soap opera, &quot;Reason To Love.&quot;  She is so deeply into this fantasy that she takes off for LA to find her &quot;former fiance&quot;, the &quot;doctor&quot; from the show.  The 2 hit men, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, have to find her to get their money back, which is hidden in her car. How far does she follow her fantasy?  Well, the imagination knows no limits here but I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone.  Suffice it to say that you will have a rollicking good time yet the film does not descend to Hollywood's dream machine level.  In short, it does not become moronic along the way.  If I had one quibble with the movie it is in using the cliche of 2 hit men to move the plot along.  However, the husband had to be disposed of in shocking fashion so I suppose that took the possibilities down to only a few.

I've seen her perfom much better in movies like &quot;Jerry Macguire&quot;.  I half to chalk it up to the terrible script or dissapointing directing.  Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock were also dissapointing in this movie, so I'm chalking it up to a terrible script.

The film's focus is Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger), a small town waitress in Kansas who prefers the world of her favorite soap opera to that of her own as the chief doormat of a philandering husband. After witnessing his violent death at the hands of drug dealers, she is emotionally propelled headlong into her soap opera world, taking off across country unaware of the stash of drugs in her trunk. Her goal is to reach the &quot;doctor&quot; of the soap opera (Greg Kinnear) and her vision is strong enough to take her all the way to the actor's inner sanctum where her delusion fits neatly with his narcissistic notion that what he does is high concept art.Meanwhile, hot on Betty's trail are her husband's killers (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), the elder fancying himself a statesman of intuiting, building up Betty as a worthy adversary, the other a rash kid with no sense of proportion. Betty does have friends who care about her and try to give her a clue but here the film makes another insightful observation: clues roll off most people. Some never do learn, some have to crash into reality before they finally get it. Betty finally gets it.The film is filled with amazing performances. Every last one is laudable but Zellweger and Freeman are stand outs. The dialogue is well written and handled, especially by Freeman who is given some nice riffs. The visual references to the themes abound. There is a natural sunlit glow to the country roads Betty takes to LA ala the yellow brick road to Oz. Kinnear's actor proves to be as short as the Wizard, a fact referenced by the contrast with the height and command of Allison Janney as the soap opera's producer/writer. Less subtle are Betty's waitress and nurse uniforms that are unmistakably Dorothy.Ultimately, there is an unevenness to the film. The violence is too jarringly realistic to fit comfortably with the comedy. It could use that FARGO touch. The allusions to THE WIZARD OF OZ are witty but intermittent. Those who want a film that gives them something to critique with pals but not in film class should enjoy this. Those who want a pleasant comedy will have that but will not be able to enjoy it thoroughly given the unsettling nature of the violence.",4,"Great acting, lots of insight, messy violence",992304000,"06 12, 2001",2001,2344,"['NURSE', 'BETTY', 'clever', 'study', 'human', 'capacity', 'avoid', 'reality', 'inventing', 'alternative', 'universes', 'self', 'film', 'focus', 'Betty', 'Sizemore', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'small', 'town', 'waitress', 'Kansas', 'who', 'world', 'favorite', 'soap', 'opera', 'own', 'chief', 'doormat', 'philandering', 'husband', 'witnessing', 'violent', 'death', 'hands', 'drug', 'dealers', 'emotionally', 'propelled', 'headlong', 'soap', 'opera', 'world', 'taking', 'off', 'country', 'unaware', 'stash', 'drugs', 'trunk', 'goal', 'reach', 'quot', 'doctor', 'quot', 'soap', 'opera', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'vision', 'strong', 'enough', 'take', 'way', 'actor', 'inner', 'sanctum', 'where', 'delusion', 'neatly', 'narcissistic', 'notion', 'what', 'high', 'concept', 'art.Meanwhile', 'hot', 'Betty', 'trail', 'are', 'husband', 'killers', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'elder', 'fancying', 'statesman', 'intuiting', 'building', 'up', 'Betty', 'worthy', 'adversary', 'other', 'rash', 'kid', 'sense', 'proportion', 'Betty', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'care', 'try', 'give', 'clue', 'here', 'film', 'insightful', 'observation', 'clues', 'roll', 'off', 'most', 'people', 'never', 'do', 'learn', 'have', 'crash', 'reality', 'finally', 'get', 'Betty', 'finally', 'it.The', 'film', 'filled', 'amazing', 'performances', 'last', 'one', 'laudable', 'Zellweger', 'Freeman', 'are', 'stand', 'outs', 'dialogue', 'well', 'written', 'handled', 'especially', 'Freeman', 'who', 'given', 'nice', 'riffs', 'visual', 'references', 'themes', 'abound', 'natural', 'sunlit', 'glow', 'country', 'Betty', 'LA', 'ala', 'yellow', 'brick', 'road', 'Oz', 'Kinnear', 'actor', 'be', 'as', 'short', 'Wizard', 'fact', 'referenced', 'contrast', 'height', 'command', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'soap', 'opera', 'producer/writer', 'Less', 'subtle', 'are', 'Betty', 'waitress', 'nurse', 'uniforms', 'are', 'unmistakably', 'Dorothy.Ultimately', 'unevenness', 'film', 'violence', 'too', 'jarringly', 'realistic', 'fit', 'comfortably', 'comedy', 'could', 'use', 'FARGO', 'touch', 'allusions', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'are', 'witty', 'intermittent', 'who', 'want', 'film', 'something', 'critique', 'pals', 'not', 'film', 'class', 'should', 'enjoy', 'who', 'want', 'pleasant', 'comedy', 'will', 'have', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'thoroughly', 'given', 'unsettling', 'nature', 'violence']",N/A

But let me explain it in my own way, nonetheless.This is a movie that I liked and found quite charming but that I did not expect most people to like very much, simply because it is movie for a certain taste.  The disturbing violence early in the movie really harms the ability to enjoy the characters played by Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock.  I accept the director's justification for this violence as found in the DVD commentary during the scene.  It does indeed, as he argues, make the traumatic effect upon Betty believable.  Unfortunately it simultaneously traumatizes most of the audience.  It is perplexing to figure how the movie could've been shot differently to both convey as effectively and believably a sense of trauma and a resulting dissociative transformation, and yet remain a comedy.With that said, I found the adventures of Nurse Betty from that point on to be really charming and surreal.  She really won me over.The value of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's performances was not really comedy but character.  For the most part they are not funny, but their performances are interesting, as are their characters' developments.  Chris Rock is a brilliant comedian, possibly the best famous comedian performing right now, yet in this movie he transforms himself into a positively chilling figure.  On rare occassions he is wonderfully funny, but for the most part he is cold and disturbing.  Quite an impressive acting job to depart so clearly from his stage persona.  It may be that he was too good of a murderer that some comedy was lost.  This may be signs of some broader acting abilities to showcase in the future.  Yet that would be a mixed blessing for then his comedy would be missed, as it was for the most part in this film.  Morgan Freeman's character is bizarre and complex and becomes humorous only through time, and still is likable in only a reserved way.  Comedy requires villains that are less truly frigthening, with weaknesses to make them laughable and endearing.  Freeman's work better than Rock's, but neither are enough to keep the movie consistently funny to balance the fright factor.Renee Zellwegger on the other hand is simultaneously a comic and dramatic revelation in this film.  What a marvelous actress she is proving to be, completely departing from her Jerry Maguire role here and showing herself in Bridgette Jones's Diary and Me, Myself and Irene to be capable of yet more radically distinct personalities.  Although all of her characters are lovably flawed and vulnerable, she plays each of them uniquely.  I agree that she was snubbed for an Oscar with this performance.  As with her ex-boyfriend Jim Carrey, we must look to the Golden Globe awards to give due acknowledgement once again.  Finally Greg Kinnear and Allison Janney are both as excellent as one would expect. Even Crispin Glover and Betty's husband and Betty's roommate are perfect castings.This movie is saved from its contradictory offering to the audience of both trauma and comedy by all these terrific performances and by some really inventive and clever writing.  However, I fully understand why some people will not be able to find the charm of the performances and the writing enough to overcome the trauma of the early visuals.",4,Traumatic and Charming,991612800,"06 4, 2001",2001,3343,"['Reading', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'am', 'pleased', 'see', 'opinion', 'borne', 'let', 'explain', 'own', 'way', 'nonetheless.This', 'movie', 'liked', 'found', 'quite', 'charming', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'most', 'people', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'simply', 'movie', 'certain', 'taste', 'disturbing', 'violence', 'early', 'movie', 'really', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'accept', 'director', 'justification', 'violence', 'found', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'scene', 'indeed', 'make', 'traumatic', 'effect', 'Betty', 'believable', 'Unfortunately', 'simultaneously', 'most', 'audience', 'perplexing', 'figure', 'how', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shot', 'differently', 'convey', 'effectively', 'believably', 'sense', 'trauma', 'resulting', 'dissociative', 'transformation', 'yet', 'remain', 'comedy.With', 'said', 'found', 'adventures', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'point', 'be', 'really', 'charming', 'surreal', 'really', 'won', 'value', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'performances', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'character', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'performances', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'characters', 'developments', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'brilliant', 'comedian', 'possibly', 'best', 'famous', 'comedian', 'performing', 'right', 'now', 'yet', 'movie', 'positively', 'chilling', 'figure', 'rare', 'occassions', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'most', 'part', 'cold', 'disturbing', 'impressive', 'acting', 'job', 'depart', 'so', 'clearly', 'stage', 'persona', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'murderer', 'comedy', 'was', 'lost', 'may', 'be', 'signs', 'broader', 'acting', 'abilities', 'showcase', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'then', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'missed', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'bizarre', 'complex', 'humorous', 'only', 'time', 'still', 'likable', 'only', 'reserved', 'way', 'Comedy', 'villains', 'are', 'less', 'truly', 'frigthening', 'weaknesses', 'make', 'laughable', 'endearing', 'Freeman', 'work', 'better', 'Rock', 'are', 'enough', 'keep', 'movie', 'consistently', 'funny', 'balance', 'fright', 'factor.Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'other', 'hand', 'simultaneously', 'comic', 'dramatic', 'revelation', 'film', 'What', 'marvelous', 'actress', 'proving', 'be', 'completely', 'departing', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'role', 'here', 'showing', 'Bridgette', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'be', 'capable', 'yet', 'more', 'radically', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'characters', 'are', 'lovably', 'flawed', 'vulnerable', 'uniquely', 'agree', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'must', 'look', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'awards', 'give', 'due', 'acknowledgement', 'once', 'again', 'Finally', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'are', 'as', 'excellent', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Even', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'Betty', 'husband', 'Betty', 'roommate', 'are', 'perfect', 'castings.This', 'movie', 'saved', 'contradictory', 'offering', 'audience', 'trauma', 'comedy', 'terrific', 'performances', 'really', 'inventive', 'clever', 'writing', 'However', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'charm', 'performances', 'writing', 'enough', 'overcome', 'trauma', 'early', 'visuals']",N/A

571766,A36L1F0YECOAW8,B0000584ZG,David Grant,"[3, 3]","After witnessing her husband's murder by two hit men, sweet-natured Betty has a nervous breakdown, becoming convinced that she is a character from her favorite soap opera and sets off to L.A. to meet her long lost love, a doctor on the show. Unfortunately, the car she's driving is loaded with drugs and the hit men are slowly, but surely, tracking her down. This is far from director Neil LaBute's searing social dramas ('In The Company Of Men' and 'Your Friends And Neighbors') but he handles the wacky source material well. In fact 'Nurse Betty' might very well be the single most surprising film of the past year, featuring more unexpected plot twists and absurd revelations then the soap opera it's characters watch religiously. It is in turns fascinating, hilarious, and disturbing. Renee Zellweger is amazing once again, balancing her performance with equal parts tenderness and goofiness. It's clear to see why she was a Golden Globe winner. The film is, in nature, a comedy sparked with players who are all too serious in their performances but quite unexpectedly throw out one-liners in such rapid succession that they always seem THIS CLOSE to being cartoons. This is a story where everything is as false as a television soap opera. The sly leading man (Greg Kinnear) is a total jerk; the stern, older hit man (a great Morgan Freeman) claims to be rooted in instinct yet clearly falls for his prey; the younger apprentice hit man (an out-of-genre yet surprisingly effective Chris Rock) would be terrifying if it weren't for the fact he's so damn laughable. But the film does have it's darker moments. The murder of Betty's husband that sets the film in motion is gruesome and graphic. We are made PAINFULLY aware that Freeman and Rock are killers as they scalp and then shoot poor Aaron Eckhart, and the act reverberates through-out the entire film. The sheer thought of sweet, lovely Betty meeting the same fate as her cheating thief of a husband looms over the action like storm clouds. The final shoot-out of the film centers around a shocking revelation that makes the outcome of the scene all the more devastating. And the final gunshot heard in the film is so startling, happening in the exact moment one character realizes her life has just begun another character's life comes to an end. This film is as light-hearted a comedy as you will find on the rental shelves but it does not lie to the audience about the reprocussions of it's character's actions. It's hard to say whether or not the film has a happy ending, but i will say it ties it up nicely, not sugar-coating the audience, and not letting them off the hook too easily either. It's a terrific film, balenced evenly on comedy and devastation and definitly deserves an audience which, unfortunately, it never found at the theaters. The DVD edition is superb, featuring two commentary tracks and a collection of 'A Reason To Love' episodes (which is the original soap opera created for the movie). The handful of deleted scenes are nice but be forewarned: one of the scenes (entitled 'The Flap') contains an EXTREME scene of violence, easily the most disgusting fatal head wound ever filmed. Seen out of context it is simply shocking and easily one extra I wished I would have just skipped over. But to deny the film would be to deny yourself 110 minutes of pure originality.

571768,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0000584ZG,Dennis Littrell,"[6, 8]","This is an adorable, if somewhat edgy, comedy from a clever and witty script by John C. Richards, crisply directed by the very talented Neil LaBute, proving that he can handle comedy just as adroitly as he can the art house movie.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger stars as Betty Sizemore, a sort of Doris Day of the 21st century, a waitress from Kansas whose fantasy life centers around Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), star of a TV soap opera called, &quot;A Reason to Live,&quot; to such a fanatical degree that she has memorized lines from the show after watching the tapes over and over again.  (This will come in handy later on.)  Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play a father-son team of cocaine-dealing hit men who ignite the premise of the movie by murdering Betty's slimy used car salesman husband, played by Aaron Eckhart, who starred in In the Company of Men (1997), also directed by Neil LaBute.  Chris Rock is a comedic psychopath, and Freeman a fatherly murderer whose favorite dictum is &quot;three in the head, you know they're dead.&quot;  One of the amazing and characteristic things about Morgan Freeman is that even while playing a professional criminal, he manages to sound like the wisest, gentlest man you ever knew.True, the plot relies heavily on co-incidence (Betty copping the keys to the Buick that just happens to have the goods in the trunk), precise timing (meeting Dr. David and entourage at exactly the right moment), and some questionable psychology (Betty's partial and convenient amnesia).  But such contrivances should be written off as poetic license and ignored.  After all, who would criticize Shakespeare for the tortured plots of his comedies?  More significantly, what makes this work is the cleverness of the plot melded well with the personalities of the characters (while gently satirizing them), and some very funny dialogue.  My favorite line is when Freeman, looking gravely at a picture of the disappeared little miss Nurse Betty, soberly remarks to Rock, &quot;We may be dealing with a cunning, ruthless woman here.&quot;  I wonder, could it be that some of the pseudonymous (and humorless) reviewers who trashed this movie here and at IMDb are jealous, out-of-work screen writers?An observation and a question:  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger has the kind of on-screen presence to delight the most jagged heart.  And who really is the reigning queen of contemporary filmland comedy, Zellweger or Reese Witherspoon?  They are both brilliant.  Witherspoon is a little more over the top while Zellweger is more impish.  It would be interesting to see them trade roles, say, Zellweger as goody-goody A-student Tracy Flick in Election (1999) and Witherspoon as Nurse Betty.  Too bad something like that can't be done.Incidentally, the song, &quot;Ca Sera, Sera&quot; heard in the background won an academy award for best song in the Hitchcock thriller, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), starring James Stewart and  Doris Day.  The reason it reappears here is not entirely clear, but the resemblance of the wonderfully naive Nurse Betty to the on- and off-screen Doris Day (who also had a hit recording of &quot;Ca Sera, Sera,&quot;) goes beyond the strawberry blond hair to a kind of irrepressible innocence.  In Nurse Betty, however, the Doris Day world of white picket fences and monogamy is given a contemporary spin.  Although this is to some extent a romantic comedy, it is one in which the answer to the question, Who gets the girl? is one never seen in a Doris Day flick.Bottom line: if you can watch this without laughing old loud and crying some real tears, you need to get your hard drive fixed.",5,"Cute, edgy and very funny",997401600,"08 10, 2001",2001,3631,"['adorable', 'somewhat', 'edgy', 'comedy', 'clever', 'witty', 'script', 'John', 'C.', 'Richards', 'crisply', 'directed', 'very', 'talented', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'proving', 'can', 'handle', 'comedy', 'just', 'as', 'adroitly', 'can', 'art', 'house', 'movie.Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'Betty', 'Sizemore', 'sort', 'Doris', 'Day', '21st', 'century', 'waitress', 'Kansas', 'fantasy', 'life', 'centers', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Ravell', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'star', 'TV', 'soap', 'opera', 'called', 'quot', 'A', 'Reason', 'Live', 'quot', 'such', 'fanatical', 'degree', 'memorized', 'lines', 'show', 'watching', 'tapes', 'over', 'again', 'will', 'come', 'handy', 'later', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'play', 'father-son', 'team', 'cocaine-dealing', 'hit', 'men', 'who', 'ignite', 'premise', 'movie', 'murdering', 'Betty', 'slimy', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'husband', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'starred', 'Company', 'Men', '1997', 'also', 'directed', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'comedic', 'psychopath', 'Freeman', 'fatherly', 'murderer', 'favorite', 'dictum', 'quot', 'three', 'head', 'know', ""'re"", 'dead.', 'quot', 'One', 'amazing', 'characteristic', 'things', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'even', 'playing', 'professional', 'criminal', 'sound', 'wisest', 'gentlest', 'man', 'ever', 'knew.True', 'plot', 'heavily', 'co-incidence', 'Betty', 'copping', 'keys', 'Buick', 'just', 'have', 'goods', 'trunk', 'precise', 'timing', 'meeting', 'Dr.', 'David', 'entourage', 'exactly', 'right', 'moment', 'questionable', 'psychology', 'Betty', 'partial', 'convenient', 'amnesia', 'such', 'contrivances', 'should', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'poetic', 'license', 'ignored', 'who', 'would', 'criticize', 'Shakespeare', 'tortured', 'plots', 'comedies', 'More', 'significantly', 'what', 'work', 'cleverness', 'plot', 'melded', 'well', 'personalities', 'characters', 'gently', 'satirizing', 'very', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'favorite', 'line', 'when', 'Freeman', 'looking', 'gravely', 'picture', 'disappeared', 'little', 'miss', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'soberly', 'remarks', 'Rock', 'quot', 'may', 'be', 'dealing', 'cunning', 'ruthless', 'woman', 'here.', 'quot', 'wonder', 'could', 'be', 'pseudonymous', 'humorless', 'reviewers', 'who', 'trashed', 'movie', 'here', 'IMDb', 'are', 'jealous', 'out-of-work', 'screen', 'writers', 'observation', 'question', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'kind', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'delight', 'most', 'jagged', 'heart', 'who', 'really', 'reigning', 'queen', 'contemporary', 'filmland', 'comedy', 'Zellweger', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Witherspoon', 'little', 'more', 'top', 'while', 'Zellweger', 'more', 'impish', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'trade', 'roles', 'say', 'Zellweger', 'goody-goody', 'A-student', 'Tracy', 'Flick', 'Election', '1999', 'Witherspoon', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'Too', 'bad', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done.Incidentally', 'song', 'quot', 'Ca', 'Sera', 'Sera', 'quot', 'heard', 'background', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'song', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', '1956', 'starring', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Doris', 'Day', 'reason', 'here', 'not', 'entirely', 'clear', 'resemblance', 'wonderfully', 'naive', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'on-', 'off-screen', 'Doris', 'Day', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'hit', 'recording', 'quot', 'Ca', 'Sera', 'Sera', 'quot', 'strawberry', 'blond', 'hair', 'kind', 'irrepressible', 'innocence', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'however', 'Doris', 'Day', 'world', 'white', 'picket', 'fences', 'monogamy', 'given', 'contemporary', 'spin', 'extent', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'one', 'answer', 'question', 'Who', 'girl', 'one', 'never', 'seen', 'Doris', 'Day', 'flick.Bottom', 'line', 'can', 'watch', 'laughing', 'old', 'loud', 'crying', 'real', 'tears', 'need', 'get', 'hard', 'drive', 'fixed']",N/A

571772,A84UFSF2SZS2W,B0000584ZG,"EriKa ""E""","[13, 13]","A complete departure for director Neil LaBute, his third film and first ""major"" vehicle, it is an amazing piece which actually turns in the total opposite direction of his first films which were not hopeful or friendly to the more human and sympathetic aspects of people. Don't get me wrong... there are still ugly, criminal, and cruel people populating this film, but this time there is a balance... and the balance is struck beautifully. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is her charming self, playing the plucky soap opera addicted Kansas waitress, Betty, who is married to a corrupt car salesman played brilliantly by Aaron Eckhart. Eckhart has shady business deals going (as well as adulterous affairs). Two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, who are both excellent) come to town to kill him and do so most gruesomely. However, they do not realise that Betty is home and witnesses the murder. (They have previously met Betty, though, because she was their waitress at the diner). Betty is watching a videotape of her favourite soap and its heartthrob doctor (played well by Greg Kinnear) when the murder takes place. As some sort of psychological defence mechanism Betty assumes a new personality and believes that she is a nurse and the fianc&eacute;e of Kinnear's character. She assumes a false life as her own, gets in the car and drives to California to reclaim that life. Things go along swimmingly at first, and the people who meet her do not realise how seriously she takes this assumed life. Most think she is joking, others think she is an overly ambitious actress trying to work her way into the soap opera. She meets the writers and stars of the soap opera, and it is only when she is told that she is going to have a walk on bit part on the soap that she ""snaps out"" of this psychological trauma. The pivotal and almost frightening part of this film is when she is on the set of the show and suddenly comes to the realisation that she does not know where she is or how she got there. Meanwhile Freeman and Rock have been chasing Betty across the country because they have to kill her since she was a witness to the murder of her husband.

571775,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B0000584ZG,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 2]","It isn't often that we see a fresh comedy.  ""Nurse Betty"" is certainly that and much more.  If this is any indication of the kind of material that we can expect from first time screenwriter John Richards, then he has a very bright future ahead of him.  It is the story of a waitress who always wanted to be a nurse.  She lives this dream vicariously by immersing herself in her favorite soap opera.  When she is emotionally traumatized by witnessing the murder of her husband, she retreats into a world where fantasy and reality are fused.  She believes that the soap opera is reality and that she is part of that reality.  So she sets out to find the lead character in the show, a doctor whom she believes was once her fianc&eacute;.Naturally, this gives rise to numerous hilarious situations as she goes about living as a soap opera character in the real world.  What is so clever about the way the story is written is that Betty is extremely believable while engaging in absurd behavior.  In most comedies, we justify the comical behavior of characters by assuming the characters or the situations are ludicrous.  In this story, the character and the situations are very realistic, but her temporary insanity puts her in a separate realm where she can be simultaneously earnest and amusing.The addition of the killers attempting to track her down adds an additional comic element, delivering a more traditional type of humor, with absurd characters doing absurd things while acting as if they believe they are serious.  This terrific and innovative blend makes the film sparkle with novel situations.The direction by Neil Labute is excellent.  It is a challenge to keep a script like this from collapsing into farce, but Labute brought forth genuine performances from all the actors that maintained the believability in the premise.  He also created some nice effects with lighting in various scenes.  Considering that this is Labute's first major motion picture, he did an extraordinary job.  As a piece of developing trivia, this is the third film directed by Labute, all of which have college chum Aaron Eckhart in the cast.  His next film, called ""Possession"", stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeremy Northam, and surprise, Aaron Eckhart.As good as the story is, it would not have worked without Renee Zellweger.  Zellweger oozes sincerity with a lovable naivet&eacute; that makes Betty utterly believable.  Since I first saw her in ""Jerry MaGuire"", I continue to be more impressed with each new role.  She has an ethereal quality about her that makes her dreamy and adorable, while still having the depth as an actor to handle the heavy scenes with an emotional force one wouldn't expect from such an airy actor.  I also enjoyed the performances of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock.  They make a wonderful odd couple, the introspective career killer and the brash hothead.  Allison Janney also gives a fantastic performance in a supporting role as the soap opera producer.This is a unique and delightful comedy despite that fact that it is a bit dark and bizarre.  I rated it a 9/10.  Sometimes dreams really do come true.",5,A fresh new comedy.

571776,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0000584ZG,Galina,"[2, 3]","Three is a charm, and it certainly was for Neil LaBute - his first three films (of In the Company of Men, Your Friends and Neighbors, and this one) were fresh, original, darkly funny, had personality and insightful, not clich&eacute;d look inside his characters' hidden desires and motivations. What he saw often was not pretty but always honest. Of three, Nurse Betty is the best - deliciously multi-layered, full of twists and turns, making fun of the TV obsessions and turning upside- down many genres. What is the film? A sort of a cinematic onion that reveals its layers one by one. It's a black comedy and a thriller, a road movie and a modern version of the girl Dorothy's adventures in the Wizard of Oz. It is very detailed clinical description of post- traumatic stress disorder and the parallel story of two dreamers who in the same fashion created in their imagination the ideal lovers that were so far removed from reality as Kansas from Oz. And the awakening was truly shocking.Renee Zellweger in a Golden Globe-winning performance has never been better, before or after Betty (Chicago came close). Morgan Freeman has never been as romantic and so much in love at the same time being a cold-blooded and meticulous hit-man. Greg Kinnear as a man from Betty's dreams, ""so handsome that a bit more and it would be a crime"" was perfectly cast and funny as the shallow TV star. The presence of Aaron Echhart and Crispin Glover did not hurt the film, either. But the real star is the script, so rich and unpredictable that it was pleasure following all its turns and twists. Underseen and underrated indie film that has only became better since I saw it first time soon after its release, it is a rare treat. This is a very funny and very dark film. It is dreamy, and it's one of the movies that make me happy just to know that it exists. Definitely recommended for repeat viewing. The ending is beauty itself.There is another ""never"" I have to add -Neil LeBute has never done anything as fresh and enjoyable since ""Nurse Betty"".4.5/5",4,Dreamers,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,2041,"['Three', 'charm', 'certainly', 'was', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'Company', 'Men', 'Your', 'Friends', 'Neighbors', 'one', 'were', 'fresh', 'original', 'darkly', 'funny', 'had', 'personality', 'insightful', 'not', 'clich', 'eacute', 'look', 'characters', 'hidden', 'desires', 'motivations', 'What', 'saw', 'often', 'was', 'not', 'pretty', 'always', 'honest', 'three', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'best', 'deliciously', 'multi-layered', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'making', 'fun', 'TV', 'obsessions', 'turning', 'upside-', 'down', 'many', 'genres', 'What', 'film', 'sort', 'cinematic', 'onion', 'layers', 'one', 'one', 'black', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'road', 'movie', 'modern', 'version', 'girl', 'Dorothy', 'adventures', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'very', 'detailed', 'clinical', 'description', 'post-', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'parallel', 'story', 'two', 'dreamers', 'who', 'same', 'fashion', 'created', 'imagination', 'ideal', 'lovers', 'were', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'reality', 'Kansas', 'Oz', 'awakening', 'was', 'truly', 'shocking.Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Golden', 'Globe-winning', 'performance', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Betty', 'Chicago', 'came', 'close', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'never', 'been', 'romantic', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'cold-blooded', 'meticulous', 'hit-man', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'man', 'Betty', 'dreams', 'so', 'handsome', 'bit', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'crime', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'funny', 'shallow', 'TV', 'star', 'presence', 'Aaron', 'Echhart', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'did', 'not', 'hurt', 'film', 'either', 'real', 'star', 'script', 'rich', 'unpredictable', 'was', 'pleasure', 'following', 'turns', 'twists', 'Underseen', 'underrated', 'indie', 'film', 'only', 'became', 'better', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'soon', 'release', 'rare', 'treat', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'dark', 'film', 'dreamy', 'one', 'movies', 'make', 'happy', 'just', 'know', 'Definitely', 'recommended', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'ending', 'beauty', 'never', 'have', 'add', '-Neil', 'LeBute', 'never', 'done', 'anything', 'fresh', 'enjoyable', 'Nurse', 'Betty', '.4.5/5']",N/A

This idiosyncratic dark comedy about a likable young woman  (Zellweger) who becomes convinced that she is a character on a soap opera  is full of surprises, impeccable acting and smart writing.In an  extraordinary, multilayered performance that suggests Doris Day at her most  resilient, Zellweger plays Betty Sizemore, a sweet-natured waitress in a  poky Kansas diner who spends her days pouring coffee and her nights  watching taped episodes of her favorite soap, A Reason to Live. When she  inadvertently witnesses a grisly murder by two hit men, she develops  temporary amnesia. Believing she's Nurse Betty from the soap, she heads to  L.A. for a rendezvous with her true love, Reason's widowed hero, Dr. David  Ravell (Kinnear). The killers take off after her.The ensuing journey  turns into one of self-discovery for both Betty and Charlie (Freeman), the  older, more reflective of the hit men. In her fictional guise, Betty gains  a strength she never had before while Charlie, the hard-nosed realist,  finds himself questioning everything of which he was once sure. Director  Neil LaBute (Your Friends &amp; Neighbors) skillfully steers the film  between gentle humor, outright farce, disturbing violence and moments of  real pain, leaving the viewer in a delightful and rarely experienced  predicament: not knowing what will happen next.The casting of Freeman  and Rock adds immeasurably to the film, with Freeman giving it tragic  grandeur and Rock contributing comic zing.

His is the  sort of role that can easily be overdone:  the soul-searching, bookish  hitman about to retire, on the cusp of some new experience that will expand  his self understanding.  Were this exaggerated, or presented too deadpan,  it would have been a disaster, but Freeman's performance is pitched  perfectly between the comic and the serious.Overall, the movie is an  awful lot of fun.  Some of the humor is pretty dark (I was shocked at some  of the gruesomeness I was laughing at), but most of it is screwy and light.  Renee Zellweger is hard not to like, and she's as loveably dingy in this  as she's ever been.  The writing is clever, and fresh. Chris Rock  is...well, Chris Rock.

When Betty gets hit on the head, she loses her memory and believes she is REALLY living in the soap opera world she loves. While Zellweiger is great, the film needs the performances of the other actors to really carry the whole premise off - and, happily, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear and the rest of the cast are rock-solid in their roles.

The only thing standing in her way is her husband, your traditional snake of a car salesman.  However, when Betty sees him brutally murdered by a couple of hit men, she goes into a fugue state.  Oblivious to her husband's death and confused by the questions the police keep asking her, Betty decides the solution to all her problems is to head to Los Angels and be reunited with her former fianc&eacute;e, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).  The only problem is that the totally delusional Betty no longer knows he is just her a character from her favorite soap opera, &quot;A Reason to Love.&quot;  Meanwhile the two odd couple hit-men, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), try to track her down, not only because she say the murder but because there is something in the car she drove off in that they want.  Unfortunately, Charlie becomes somewhat fixated on Betty, who will be his last target before retirement.  This only infuriates his hotheaded younger partner Wesley.Betty arrives in L.A. looking for &quot;Dr. Ravell&quot; and enjoys a couple of lucky twists of fate.  After saving the life of a young man by using a procedure she saw on television once, Betty ends up with a job in a hospital and a place to stay with Rosa, the man's sister.  Rosa even helps Betty look for David, until she discovers the truth and decides to set Betty up for a disastrous meeting with the actor who plays him at a charity function.  This encounter becomes the pivotal scene of the film providing its best moments as &quot;David&quot; is totally captivated by what he thinks is amazing improvisational method acting from Betty.  The scene is wonderfully sustained and provides the best acting moments in the film for both Zellweger and Kinnear.  Their surprising connection provides the magic that allows the story to proceed.  Of course, Betty's bubble finally bursts in a scene that is, somewhat surprisingly, brutally realistic, just as all the plot lines get drawn together for the film's climax.  We are pretty sure Betty's life is going to have a happy ending, but there are enough twists and turns here that we are not willing to predict exactly how things are going to turn out.This DVD includes the nine brief installments of the faux soap &quot;A Reason to Love.&quot;  One of the nice things about this DVD are the two director's commentary tracks, the first has LaBute with the cast, while the second features the director with the crew.  However, this disc does not have any subtitles to turn on while you listen to the commentary.

571792,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0000584ZG,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 4]","""Nurse Betty"" is a good taste tester as Neil LaBute continues to push the envelope.  After watching Gweneth Paltrow & Aaron Eckhart in LaBute's ""Possession,"" I was curious what I'd missed with this DVD.  Whether James Flamberg deserved the best screenplay prize at Cannes in 2000 for this script, I'm not sure.  Usually, writers are told to avoid making your main character crazy because the audience would have to be crazy to relate to them.  If there's a difficulty accessing the film, it would be that.As far as acting execution, the only one who I consistently fail to connect with is Chris Rock.  The one deleted scene on the DVD where he talks about sex with Asian women is about as gross as I could imagine; and I wasn't that pleased with his scenes left in the movie.  The deleted flap scene where his skull explodes was more relief than bother.  Aaron Eckhart with a bizarre haircut gets the LaBute obnoxious treatment & performs admirably as the dense self-centered husband who leaves his scalp on the floor.  The supporting character Tia Texada as Rosa does a wonderful job as Zellweger's L.A. roommate.  Allison Janney as producer Lyla has a limited amount to do, but does it wonderfully.  Kathleen Wilhoite as best friend Sue Ann does her usual great job with her distinctive raspy voice.  Crispin Glover from ""Back to the Future"" who is creeping people out right now with ""Willard"" does a great supporting job as news reporter Roy.The leads are also excellent.  Renee Zellweger is interesting to watch, and has that great Doris Day thing going on.  The film hinges on our believing her disassociation from reality; and she does it so sweetly that we do.  Morgan Freeman could read the phone book; and he'd be great, which he is here again.  Greg Kinnear gets to play a variety of levels as Dr. David Ravell on the soap ""A Reason to Love"" and as actor George McCord who is charmed by Betty.Obviously, this is a strange little tale.  My wife kept saying in disbelief when it was over, ""I thought it was a comedy.""

LaBute is working with someone else's script this time, and that may be the reason this film was more successful than his first two efforts.  A dark comedy with some surprisingly graphic violence, this is definitely a departure from his character driven ensembles that have you liking absolutely no one.It's hard not to like Betty -- she's a down on her luck waitress that has an absolutely golden presence.  Who couldn't like her?  It's difficult to know whether Zellweger's more likeable here, as Bridget, or in her &quot;Chicago&quot; role.  In a very short time, she has established herself as leading lady material, and the camera loves her.  As Betty, her crush on a soap opera star (Greg Kinnear as Actor George McCord) who is a doctor in his role, becomes more serious when her low-life husband is killed by two mobsters.  Betty witnesses the murder, and unknowingly takes the car that has the merchandise the mobsters are searching for.  When Betty leaves her small-town life for LA, she's disassociated from reality and is going to find &quot;Dr. Ravell&quot; her real love.Kinnear is charming and alternately confused and attracted to Betty (who acts as a nurse in the soap opera).  Morgan Freeman is terrific as Charlie, from the mob, who can't help his attraction to Betty, despite his mission.  Only Chris Rock, who plays Charlie's son, seems to be miscast, in a whiny and bitter role.  Chris -- you CAN play comedy!  The screen shines when Zellweger is on it, and you are ultimately drawn into her world and are there when it comes crashing down around her.LaBute did a marvelous job with the film, but the DVD extras are sparse and some of the deleted scenes are truly distasteful.  Alison Janney is wasted in a throw away role, but LaBute does manage to find a small role for his favorite actor, Aaron Eckhart (he's been in all LaBute's films) as the smarmy husband.  John C. Richards and James Flamberg won at Cannes for the screenplay, and it does surprise in the way it tells an unusual story.Not for everyone, especially for those looking for light comedy.

I certainly would not rate it one of the best films of last year, but I do realize how different and novel the movie is.Renee Zellweger in particular has fascinated me with her choice in roles. No doubt, 'Bridget Jones' Diary' will propel her into superstardom, but its roles like this and her simple turn in 'Jerry Maguire' that make this actress more refreshing than Julia Roberts on a good day. That said, 'Nurse Betty' demands much from its' lead actress and a solid screenplay, and fortunately, it scores high in both departments.Sadly, every film has its' weaknesses, and this one is no different. Some of the acting is sloppy, especially Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's scenes together. And while Renee steers the movie along at a nice pace, there are moments when you can't help yawning and hoping that something drastic happens soon. And it does. This is a movie with a load of surprises, and though it manages to be heavily cliche-driven, despite the novel subject matter, it does shine when it matters.I got this on DVD the other day and was struck by the brilliant picture transfer, and the wonderful inclusion of 10 mini-episodes of 'A Reason to Love', the fictional soap that Nurse Betty lives to watch. Greg Kinnear is great as a self-obsessed actor (though he does over-play his tantrum scene in the end) and Chris Rock as a fanatical mobman is excellent, if a little scary.But in the end, the film is Renee's. Don't be put off by the cheesy DVD cover art - I looked past that, and found myself enjoying a smart, witty comedy, with shades of dark to counter the cheer, at every turn.

Del is cheating on her. Betty, unaware and far too nice to ever cheat on him, is in love with a doctor on her favourite soap opera. One night as Betty is watching TV, two professional criminals turn up to the house and kill Del for trying to play them on a drug deal.Betty, watching through the door, goes into a state of shock. Fantasy and reality twist in her mind, and she blanks out the murder and decides to head out to LA to find her soap opera doctor, whom she believes is her ex-fianc&eacute;e. The problem is, the car she takes is the car which Del stored the drugs in. So the criminals, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), follow her trail across America.Betty, in love with the fantasy of a doctor, thinks only of him and meanwhile Charlie begins to think only of Betty, after seeing a photograph of her and building up a fantasy version of her in his head. Even though Betty is the one who is ""crazy"", they are really both on the trail of their dreams, in love with people they don't know.The film manages to avoid any clich&eacute;s and creates characters we really do care about, and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger's performance is pitch-perfect.

571798,A36EW68H08UOCS,B0000584ZG,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 3]","Nurse Betty has a terrific cast who pull off a script that dances through improbable sequences and provides great poignant interludes.  The movie has wry insights into the ridiculousness of Hollywood and the extremes that ordinary people will pursue to follow completely unobtainable and false goals, yet it does these things with a gentle touch rather than a heavy hammer.Renee Zellweger is great as Betty Sizemore, a mousy housewife in Kansas whose only emotional outlet is her daily dose of the soap opera ""A Reason to Love"", which features saintly widowed heart surgeon, Dr. David Ravell, played by Greg Kinnear.  Betty is loved by everyone down at the tip-top diner where she is a tip-top waitress, but emotionally abused and cheated on by her husband, Del, played by Aaron Eckhart.  Del is a car salesman with vague dreams of bigger things, sort of like Bill Macy in ""Fargo"".  Del is also like a Coen Brothers character in that he is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.  In his big scene he tells Morgan Freeman's character how ""stupid"" the people are in his little Kansas town.  Freeman has Del give a specific example of what he means by ""stupid"". Del responds with an answer showing Freeman and the audience that Del meets almost anyone's definition of ""stupid"".Freeman is Charley, a freelance hit-man, and he is accompanied by Chris Rock as his apprentice, Wesley.  Charley knows he is at the twilight of his career, and he considers himself a consummate professional, although he knows he is ""a garbage man of the human condition.""  Wesley is not as professional, prone to quicker, less thoughtful action, and grudgingly accepts Charley's lessons on professionalism.The early scene where Del tells Charley about the ""stupid injuns"" and other bigoted things ends with Wesley scalping Del and Charley finishing the job with his pistol, so a warning about Coen-flavored violence is appropriate.Betty is in an adjacent room watching the videotape of that day's soap opera when Del is murdered.The violent act snaps Betty's mind, resulting in her delusion that she had a previous life where she was soap Dr. Ravell's fianc&eacute;e, following a plotline from the show five years ago.  She takes a Buick from Del's lot and leaves Kansas for the first time, headed for Dr. Ravell's fictional hospital.The joy in this film comes in the way that the other characters interact with the sweet but mentally unstable Betty.  Consider the way a good-intentioned bartender in Arizona first encourages Betty when she tells her that she's trading in her no-good car dealer for a heart surgeon, then realizes that Betty earnestly believes she's headed to L.A. to hook up with a fictional character in a soap opera.Later the magnificent Allison Janney appears as the producer of the soap opera, first amazed at Betty, who she assumes must be play-acting as an audition for the show, then ready to exploit the publicity Betty generates as a result of an incident that I'll not tell you about.The heart of the film is the equally fictitious relationship between Morgan Freeman's Charley and the mental image he creates about Betty. Charley places Betty on a mental pedestal as a paradigm of ideal womanhood. When he learns that she has driven halfway across the country to ""reunite"" with a soap opera character he is incredulous.  ""A soap opera!?  She just wouldn't do all this because of a soap opera!"" he tells his apprentice.But she would.Enjoy.",4,A Nearly Great Film - Definitely Worth A Look,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,3442,"['Nurse', 'Betty', 'terrific', 'cast', 'who', 'off', 'script', 'improbable', 'sequences', 'great', 'poignant', 'interludes', 'movie', 'wry', 'insights', 'ridiculousness', 'Hollywood', 'extremes', 'ordinary', 'people', 'will', 'pursue', 'follow', 'completely', 'unobtainable', 'false', 'goals', 'things', 'gentle', 'touch', 'rather', 'heavy', 'hammer.Renee', 'Zellweger', 'great', 'Betty', 'Sizemore', 'mousy', 'housewife', 'Kansas', 'only', 'emotional', 'outlet', 'daily', 'dose', 'soap', 'opera', 'Reason', 'Love', 'saintly', 'widowed', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Ravell', 'played', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Betty', 'loved', 'everyone', 'down', 'tip-top', 'diner', 'where', 'tip-top', 'waitress', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'cheated', 'husband', 'Del', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Del', 'car', 'salesman', 'vague', 'dreams', 'bigger', 'things', 'sort', 'like', 'Bill', 'Macy', 'Fargo', 'Del', 'also', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'character', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'smart', 'big', 'scene', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'how', 'stupid', 'people', 'are', 'little', 'Kansas', 'town', 'Freeman', 'Del', 'give', 'specific', 'example', 'what', 'stupid', 'Del', 'answer', 'showing', 'Freeman', 'audience', 'Del', 'almost', 'anyone', 'definition', 'stupid', '.Freeman', 'Charley', 'freelance', 'hit-man', 'accompanied', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'apprentice', 'Wesley', 'Charley', 'twilight', 'career', 'consummate', 'professional', 'garbage', 'man', 'human', 'condition', 'Wesley', 'not', 'professional', 'prone', 'quicker', 'less', 'thoughtful', 'action', 'grudgingly', 'Charley', 'lessons', 'professionalism.The', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'Del', 'Charley', 'stupid', 'injuns', 'other', 'bigoted', 'things', 'Wesley', 'scalping', 'Del', 'Charley', 'finishing', 'job', 'pistol', 'warning', 'Coen-flavored', 'violence', 'appropriate.Betty', 'adjacent', 'room', 'watching', 'videotape', 'day', 'soap', 'opera', 'when', 'Del', 'murdered.The', 'violent', 'act', 'Betty', 'mind', 'resulting', 'delusion', 'had', 'previous', 'life', 'where', 'was', 'soap', 'Dr.', 'Ravell', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'following', 'plotline', 'show', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'Buick', 'Del', 'lot', 'Kansas', 'first', 'time', 'headed', 'Dr.', 'Ravell', 'fictional', 'hospital.The', 'joy', 'film', 'way', 'other', 'characters', 'interact', 'sweet', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'Betty', 'Consider', 'way', 'good-intentioned', 'bartender', 'Arizona', 'first', 'encourages', 'Betty', 'when', 'trading', 'no-good', 'car', 'dealer', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'then', 'Betty', 'earnestly', 'headed', 'L.A.', 'hook', 'up', 'fictional', 'character', 'soap', 'magnificent', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'producer', 'soap', 'opera', 'first', 'amazed', 'Betty', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'play-acting', 'audition', 'show', 'then', 'ready', 'exploit', 'publicity', 'Betty', 'result', 'incident', ""'ll"", 'not', 'tell', 'about.The', 'heart', 'film', 'equally', 'fictitious', 'relationship', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Charley', 'mental', 'image', 'Betty', 'Charley', 'places', 'Betty', 'mental', 'pedestal', 'paradigm', 'ideal', 'womanhood', 'When', 'driven', 'halfway', 'country', 'reunite', 'soap', 'opera', 'character', 'incredulous', 'soap', 'opera', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'soap', 'opera', 'apprentice.But', 'would.Enjoy']",N/A

571800,A1V5G1O9TRGO7M,B0000584ZG,matt,"[0, 3]","Nurse Betty isn't a terrible movie, but it's not all that great either.  It takes a pretty funny concept, serves up a wonderful cast and continues to do nothing with it.  Director Neil LaBute walks the line between comedy and drama in this film, but it all becomes a tedious bore.Renee Zellweger shines as Betty, an unhappily married waitress who religiously watches a soap opera and has a crush on the show's number 1 star (Greg Kinnear).  What Betty doesn't know is that her slimeball husband (Aaron Eckhart-who was excellent in LaBute's In the Company of Men) is mixed up in some sort of a drug deal and one night, is visited by two hitmen played by Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock.  When Betty's husband is brutally murdered by Rock, she witnesses the killing and goes into a state of shock.Her mind takes her into her soap opera where she becomes 'nurse Betty' and sets out for California to find Kinner (who of course, plays a doctor on her favorite show).Nurse Betty is a movie that seems like it's going to get really, really good any second, but as Betty begins her trek to California-she doesn't know about the drug stash in her trunk-she is pursued by Freeman and Rock.  This is about as far as this film goes.  At first it's funny to see Betty interact with the outside world as she believes she's on a soap opera, but the movie basically coasts on this one joke until the final twenty minutes.  It becomes tiring and quite dull.  There's an amusing sequence where she meets up with Kinnear's character and speaks to him using only lines from the show.  At the same time, Freeman and Rock are on her trail, Morgan Freeman is great in just about anything he does, the dialogue between he and Rock is a little explicit, but often hilarious.  He turns in a great performance as his character grows more and more obsessed with Betty.  Chris Rock really surpises here also, he is quite funny in this film, but his role, as a psychotic hitman borders on chilling.  When the film finally arrives at its predictable climax, there aren't many surprises and one can't help but be glad to see this one finished.  At nearly two hours, it's needlessly long and repetitive.  Nurse Betty may not have much going for it in terms of story, but if you're a fan of any of the actors in this film, I would suggest renting it.  All of the actors in this film shine.  There's even a great small role by Crispin Glover (George McFly in Back to the Future) who is hilarious.  The film itself meshes grisily violence (the murder sequence is a bit disturbing) with light comedy and comes up empty.  I can't say this is a terrible film, but not very good either.

571801,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0000584ZG,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","Nurse Betty is a smart, satirical and dark comedy that threatens at times to veer off track. Each time it does so, it winds up redeeming itself, but the result is a movie that does not manage to entertain consistently throughout. It also has an odd way of both repelling and engaging the viewer. Its strongest point is its originality, and that's saying something in a year [2000] that was pretty predictable at the movies.Renee Zellweger is Betty Sizemore, a small town waitress whose husband, Del [Aaron Eckhart] is a crass, petty man. He owns a used car lot, and when Betty asks if she can borrow a 1997 Buick LeSabre off the lot so she can celebrate her birthday with a girlfriend, he tells her a cheaper car should do her just fine. Betty sneaks off with the Buick anyway, but her friend is unable to go out with her. She returns home, planning to return the car the next day, and begins to watch a videotape of her favorite soap opera. It's clear that in Betty's drab and uneventful life, this program is almost the center of her existence. When Del comes home, Betty, who is in the den, turns the TV down but continues to watch. Unbeknownst to her, the two men Del has brought to the house turn out to be there to collect on a big drug deal Del screwed some folks on. The guys are Charlie and his son Wesley [Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock], and in a miscommunication between father and son, Del winds up dead in the living room. Hearing the shots, Betty peeks through a doorway. She sees them. They don't see her.Betty goes into a post traumatic shock in which the world completely alters for her. After the sheriff and the local newspaper reporter [Pruitt Taylor Vane and Crispin Glover] have been in the house awhile investigating the murder, Betty suddenly smiles, thanks them for dropping by and leaves. In her mind there has been no crime. Suddenly, she believes that she was once engaged to Dr. David Ravell, a lead character on her beloved soap opera. Betty takes off in the Buick for Los Angeles in search of David and begins a series of very strange adventures. Charlie and Wesley are soon in hot pursuit because they know something she doesn't...Zellweger was a wonderful choice to play Bette. With her wispy but raspy voice and her little girl lost looks, she is ideal in a movie that is liberally laced with references to The Wizard of Oz. Greg Kinnear gives some nice touches to George McCord, the actor who play Dr. Ravell. He's a man whose ego has caused him to lose sight of what's important. Freeman, master that he is, manages to bring empathy to a character that really doesn't deserve any. I say he doesn't deserve any because I have never been able to buy into the Hollywood cliche in which a guy who makes a living as a hit man is, underneath it all, just a regular guy trying to get by in life. I also have a difficult time finding such a character amusing.It is hard to peg Nurse Betty, and that's okay. If it's a family comedy you're after, forget it. If you like your comedy on the fresh and quirky side, by all means give Betty a try.",4,"Dark, eccentric comedy not for everyone",1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,3068,"['Nurse', 'Betty', 'smart', 'satirical', 'dark', 'comedy', 'times', 'veer', 'off', 'track', 'time', 'so', 'up', 'redeeming', 'result', 'movie', 'not', 'manage', 'entertain', 'consistently', 'also', 'odd', 'way', 'repelling', 'engaging', 'viewer', 'strongest', 'point', 'originality', 'saying', 'something', 'year', '[', '2000', ']', 'was', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'movies.Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Betty', 'Sizemore', 'small', 'town', 'waitress', 'husband', 'Del', '[', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', ']', 'crass', 'petty', 'man', 'used', 'car', 'lot', 'when', 'Betty', 'can', 'borrow', '1997', 'Buick', 'LeSabre', 'lot', 'can', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'girlfriend', 'cheaper', 'car', 'should', 'do', 'just', 'fine', 'Betty', 'sneaks', 'off', 'Buick', 'anyway', 'friend', 'unable', 'go', 'out', 'home', 'planning', 'return', 'car', 'next', 'day', 'watch', 'videotape', 'favorite', 'soap', 'opera', 'clear', 'Betty', 'drab', 'uneventful', 'life', 'program', 'almost', 'center', 'existence', 'When', 'Del', 'home', 'Betty', 'who', 'den', 'TV', 'down', 'watch', 'Unbeknownst', 'two', 'men', 'Del', 'brought', 'house', 'out', 'be', 'there', 'collect', 'big', 'drug', 'deal', 'Del', 'screwed', 'folks', 'guys', 'are', 'Charlie', 'son', 'Wesley', '[', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Chris', 'Rock', ']', 'miscommunication', 'father', 'son', 'Del', 'up', 'dead', 'living', 'room', 'Hearing', 'shots', 'Betty', 'doorway', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'her.Betty', 'post', 'traumatic', 'shock', 'world', 'completely', 'alters', 'sheriff', 'local', 'newspaper', 'reporter', '[', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vane', 'Crispin', 'Glover', ']', 'have', 'been', 'house', 'investigating', 'murder', 'Betty', 'suddenly', 'thanks', 'dropping', 'leaves', 'mind', 'been', 'crime', 'Suddenly', 'was', 'once', 'engaged', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Ravell', 'lead', 'character', 'beloved', 'soap', 'opera', 'Betty', 'off', 'Buick', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'search', 'David', 'series', 'very', 'strange', 'adventures', 'Charlie', 'Wesley', 'are', 'soon', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'know', 'something', ""n't"", 'Zellweger', 'was', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'play', 'Bette', 'wispy', 'raspy', 'voice', 'little', 'girl', 'lost', 'looks', 'ideal', 'movie', 'liberally', 'laced', 'references', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'nice', 'touches', 'George', 'McCord', 'actor', 'who', 'play', 'Dr.', 'Ravell', 'man', 'ego', 'caused', 'lose', 'sight', 'what', 'important', 'Freeman', 'master', 'manages', 'bring', 'empathy', 'character', 'really', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'say', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'buy', 'Hollywood', 'cliche', 'guy', 'who', 'living', 'hit', 'man', 'just', 'regular', 'guy', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'also', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'finding', 'such', 'character', 'amusing.It', 'hard', 'peg', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'okay', 'family', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'forget', 'like', 'comedy', 'fresh', 'quirky', 'side', 'means', 'give', 'Betty', 'try']",N/A

571803,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B0000584ZG,Mike Stone,"[0, 0]","I think what prevents ""Nurse Betty"" from becoming a really great movie is that it tries to be too many things at once.  It is part soap opera parody, woman on the run flick, buddy movie, satire of small town America, and deconstruction of the line between fantasy and reality.  On their own, all of these elements work wonderfully.  But when combined together in a jumbled stew, the pot tends to overflow.  That's not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie.  I did.  Immensely.Topping the list of enjoyable elements is the fine cast.  Morgan Freeman exudes wisdom and cool in one scene, and off-his-rocker mania in another.  He is so effortless here, you won't be able to spot him acting.  Most of his scenes are with Chris Rock, who, while not up to Freeman's lofty standards, acquits himself quite well in his portrayal of a surprisingly complex character.  These two share an easy chemistry, and provide some of the movie's funnier moments.  Greg Kinnear is cast perfectly as a handsome but bland soap opera star.  He doesn't really do much other than flash his perfect teeth and show off the sparkle in his eyes, but then again he doesn't really have to.  His character is little more than a device.  In smaller roles, Aaron Eckhart (a LaBute staple), Crispin Glover, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and the great Allison Janney do yeomen's work livening up the background.  And Renee Zellweger shines in the title role.  I am not usually a fan of her work (her schtick strikes me as nothing more than Joey Lauren Adams-lite), but here she is appealing as the woman on the run from both hired killers and her own senses.  Loaded up with attractive innocence, you can't help fall and feel sorry for Zellweger's Betty.Neil LaBute, the writer/director behind the scornful double-bill ""In the Company of Men"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors"", only wears his director's hat here.  Which I thought would have been too bad, because it was his writing that pushed those two flicks over the top.  He seems to have poured his writer's energy into directing, for there are some moments when he tries too hard to make an impression (i.e., using extreme blues or browns in certain scenes, calls too much attention to his style when it's not really needed).  Overall, though, he did a fine job, moving the story along, and getting some great work from his actors.  He leaves the script in the hands of John C. Richards and James Flamberg, both first time screenwriters, who do an admirable job with it.  Although their collective minds begin to wander at times (the scenes of Betty in the company of her soap opera fantasy man could have been shortened a tad), when they get their focus, it is strong and funny.  In the end, I didn't miss the vitriol of LaBute's earlier films (although I am itching for him to return to those days again).Although not really able to spark the kinds of dialogue that his previous films did, ""Nurse Betty"" is ultimately a rewarding experience from LaBute.  It never stands up to make any bold statements, preferring to take the gentler road.  And I guess that's the real strength: in showing that LaBute is more than a one-note auteur, ""Betty"" is a promise of a varied and interesting filmmaking career to come.",4,"In LaBute's fine film, all Betty's are off",983577600,"03 3, 2001",2001,3220,"['think', 'what', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'becoming', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'part', 'soap', 'opera', 'parody', 'woman', 'run', 'flick', 'buddy', 'movie', 'satire', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'deconstruction', 'line', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'own', 'elements', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'when', 'combined', 'together', 'jumbled', 'stew', 'pot', 'overflow', 'not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'did', 'Immensely.Topping', 'list', 'enjoyable', 'elements', 'fine', 'cast', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'wisdom', 'cool', 'one', 'scene', 'off-his-rocker', 'mania', 'so', 'effortless', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'spot', 'acting', 'Most', 'scenes', 'are', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'who', 'not', 'Freeman', 'lofty', 'standards', 'quite', 'well', 'portrayal', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'character', 'two', 'share', 'easy', 'chemistry', 'provide', 'movie', 'funnier', 'moments', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'handsome', 'bland', 'soap', 'opera', 'star', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'other', 'flash', 'perfect', 'teeth', 'show', 'off', 'sparkle', 'eyes', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'device', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'LaBute', 'staple', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'great', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'do', 'yeomen', 'work', 'livening', 'up', 'background', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'shines', 'title', 'role', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'work', 'schtick', 'strikes', 'nothing', 'more', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams-lite', 'here', 'appealing', 'woman', 'run', 'hired', 'killers', 'own', 'senses', 'Loaded', 'up', 'attractive', 'innocence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Zellweger', 'Betty.Neil', 'LaBute', 'writer/director', 'scornful', 'double-bill', 'Company', 'Men', 'Friends', 'Neighbors', 'only', 'director', 'hat', 'here', 'Which', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'writing', 'pushed', 'two', 'flicks', 'top', 'have', 'poured', 'writer', 'energy', 'directing', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'impression', 'i.e.', 'using', 'extreme', 'blues', 'browns', 'certain', 'scenes', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'style', 'when', 'not', 'really', 'needed', 'Overall', 'though', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'moving', 'story', 'getting', 'great', 'work', 'actors', 'script', 'hands', 'John', 'C.', 'Richards', 'James', 'Flamberg', 'first', 'time', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'do', 'admirable', 'job', 'collective', 'minds', 'begin', 'wander', 'times', 'scenes', 'Betty', 'company', 'soap', 'opera', 'fantasy', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shortened', 'tad', 'when', 'get', 'focus', 'strong', 'funny', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'vitriol', 'LaBute', 'earlier', 'films', 'am', 'itching', 'return', 'days', 'again', 'not', 'really', 'able', 'spark', 'kinds', 'dialogue', 'previous', 'films', 'did', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'ultimately', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'LaBute', 'never', 'up', 'make', 'bold', 'statements', 'preferring', 'take', 'gentler', 'road', 'guess', 'real', 'strength', 'showing', 'LaBute', 'more', 'one-note', 'auteur', 'Betty', 'promise', 'varied', 'interesting', 'filmmaking', 'career', 'come']",N/A

In fact, the core story of Renee Zellweger's character going a little nuts after seeing her husband brutally killed and trying to join the world of her favorite soap opera which she suddenly thinks is real is actually pretty sweet.  That's because of Renee's excellent performance.  She brings such genuine empathy to the character that it's hard to find her character's predicament funny.  Yes, it's amusing how she manages to blithely insinuate herself into the make-believe soap world without anyone figuring out how truly nuts she is, but thanks to Renee's performance,  I was also rooting for her to be successful in her bizarre endeavor.As for the parallel storyline involving Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, it had it's funny moments, but it was nowhere close to fully utlizing Rock's darkly comic talent.  I felt like any number of actors could have played this role; I would have much preferred to see Rock make it his own.  Freeman was wonderful, of course.  Unfortunately, these two were involved in some incredibly violent scenes - much more gruesome than you would expect to see in a movie that bills itself as a comedy.All in all, I enjoyed the movie, but I can see why it wasn't more of a success despite some great performances.

571814,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B0000584ZG,Reviewer,"[18, 18]","A young waitress in a small town in Kansas witnesses an act of violence so unspeakable that her mind refuses to accept it; instead, like a ray of light reflected through a prism, she takes a detour within herself and enters a reality in which things are just a little bit better and nicer, one that fuses with the world of her favorite soap opera wherein resides the ""doctor"" of her dreams.  Renee Zellweger stars in ""Nurse Betty,"" a satirical comedy/drama with some serious psychological overtones from director Neil LaBute.  It's an objective look at, among other things, small town life, the aesthetics of professional hit men, an unhealthy (?) obsession with soap operas, and the ethics of car salesmen.  One thing is certain:  After the aforementioned incident, Dorothy isn't in Kansas anymore.  And her story becomes an odyssey of sorts, one that is both exhilarating and hilarious, and by turn somber and disturbing.  Since those with whom Betty comes into contact do not realize that she is dwelling within a reality of her own design, it creates moments of absolute side-splitting hilarity as they try to figure out what is going on with her; is she putting them on, or is she in fact, deranged?  But at the same time, even as you're laughing, there is an element of discomfort about it, because you know the truth of it all, and what a sad and serious situation it really is.  You feel, not only for Betty, but for all of those involved with her as well, and it's like manic depression; you ride the wild highs, but come down just as hard.  As Betty, Renee Zellweger gives what just may be the best performance of her career; there is such a gentleness of nature about her, a winsomeness and pacificism that makes her such a wonderfully sympathetic character.  Early in the film LaBute establishes what kind of a person Betty is; she's easy to like and someone you care about instantly, someone you want to see good things happen to.  And it makes the impact of the violence with which she is visited all the more profound (and be advised, the scene is shockingly reminiscent of the torture scene in ""Reservoir Dogs;"" somewhat graphic, but because of excellent directing and editing, you get the illusion of seeing more than you actually are.  It is definitely one that you will not soon forget).  These are things that should not happen to someone like Betty; it just doesn't seem fair somehow, and the connection that she makes with the audience underscores what a brilliant job Zellweger has done.  Equal credit, of course, has to go to Neil LaBute, for creating the perfect atmosphere through which the desired results are so impeccably delivered.  The serene, almost lilting essence of Betty's reality, this kind of &quot;Pleasantville&quot; into which she has entered, contrasts so vividly with the thread of violence and menace laced throughout that it heightens the emotional response to it all.  He has successfully managed the perfect balancing of the pure with the despicable and enhanced it all with pace, timing and some memorable performances.  Besides Zellweger, Morgan Freeman is outstanding as Charlie, the aging hit-man out to finish one last job before retiring.  He brings a commanding demeanor to the role, coupled with a maturity and intelligence that adds so much to the depth of the character.  And Greg Kinnear, as Dr. David Ravell/George McCord, gives a definitive performance as the soap opera star of Betty's dreams.  It is a character Kinnear was born to play and he covers all the bases, leaving no doubt as to just exactly who and what this guy is all about.  Notable performances also are turned in by Chris Rock, as Wesley, Charlie's protege; and by Aaron Eckhart, as Del, Betty's sleazy, neglectful car salesman husband.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Tia Texada (Rosa), Crispin Glover (Roy), Pruitt Taylor Vince (Ballard), Allison Janney (Lyla) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Sue Ann).  Rarely are there so many truly memorable performances in a single movie, and again, LaBute must be given credit for bringing out the best in his actors; it adds a polish to the finished product that is inestimable.  Another reason for the success of this film is that the humor is natural and true; rather than being forced or contrived it issues from real situations and the characters reactions to them, and LaBute plays everything straight, which makes it all real.  The laughs (and there are many) are born of their own merit; each one is honest and earned.  And again, because of that purity of delivery, it makes the drama all the more effective.  Well made and delivered, ""Nurse Betty"" is highly entertaining and certainly memorable; a funny, emotional movie that will have you alternately gasping and cheering.

When her husband is killed, she sets out to Los Angeles with the delusion that she is somehow part of the doctor's/actor's life.  And she succeeds after a fashion.

571816,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000584ZG,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 6]","The best thing about ""Nurse Betty"" is that you never quite know where it's going.  Its loose and freeform structure allows the writers, John C. Richards and James Flamberg, to fashion their work from a wide range of disparate moods and styles - and the strain rarely shows.  One can question the appropriateness of a particularly gruesome scene early on in the film, but, for the most part, ""Nurse Betty"" wins us over with its originality, sweetness and charm.  The first element is provided by the screenwriters, but the second two come principally from the film's star, Renee Zellweger, who, as always, radiates the kind of beauty and vulnerability of spirit that have made her a major star for our time.Zellweger plays Betty Sizemore, a waitress working in a caf&eacute; in Kansas, who escapes the grim reality of her marriage to a callous philanderer by blanking herself into her favorite soap opera and fantasizing about her favorite soap opera character, the handsome Dr. David Ravell, played by Greg Kinnear.  When Betty witnesses the brutal murder of her husband, she lapses into a state of psychosomatic denial, becoming convinced not only that the world of her TV program is real but that she must travel to Los Angeles to reunite with her former fianc&eacute;, Dr. Ravell himself.  Thus begins Betty's bizarre cross-country odyssey, followed closely on her heels by Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, the men responsible for her husband's death.But the odyssey Betty undergoes is not merely a geographical one - for she also takes a journey deep into the recesses of comic madness.  As a result, while there is humor in much of what she goes through, there is also pain - and the writers and the actress hit on both notes perfectly.  Thus, while Betty's confusion about what is real and what is fantasy often leads to comic misunderstandings, it also leads to the kind of fear, misapprehension and insecurity that can accompany irrationality.In a similar way, the writers knock us off balance with their conception of the Freeman and Rock characters.  Here are men - one a hotheaded, cold-blooded, calculated killer, the other a professional criminal who admits to knocking off those people who ""deserve it"" - who come across at times as quietly convincing humorous charmers.  ""Nurse Betty"" is not always a ""comfortable"" comedy.With its multitude of characters, settings and tones, ""Nurse Betty"" sometimes seems as if it will rip apart at the seams.  Yet, thanks to the skilled hand of director Neil LaBute, this never happens.  In fact, the film has an expansive, almost epic quality rarely found in a comedy.

She dreams of being a nurse in the world of her favorite soap opera &quot;A Reason To Love&quot;. She is even in love with a character from the show named David Ravell. Apart from her dreams, her real life is not so great. Her husband is a cheating scum bag who leaves her alone on her birthday. When Betty witnesses a horrible crime, her shock transports her into the world of &quot;A Reason To Love&quot;. She thinks she is Nurse Betty and sets off to find her long lost love Doctor David Ravell.My Opinion:  Nurse Betty was a lot different than I expected. In fact it was just plain different. I don't know if &quot;Dark Comedy&quot; correctly describes it, but it comes close. It has both comedic parts and violent serious parts. The violent scenes are quite serious but they are surrounded by lighter scenes. Betty's life is quite sad in the beginning of the film. She goes through a transformation that brings out her true self. This is a very intelligent and creative movie. Chris Rock is at his best in this one as is Renee Zellweger.DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic 2.25:1, DD5.1. Good picture quality and sound. Two separate commentary tracks, deleted scenes, episodes of &quot;A Reason to Love&quot;, and trailers. The extras on this DVD are really great.What You Should Do:  See it if you can handle off beat movies. It is a bit different from the mainstream romantic comedy so be prepared. If you are a film buff in general, and enjoy intelligent movies, then you are in for a treat.Related DVDs To Check Out: O Brother Where Art Thou?",4,Three In The Head And You Know He's Dead,993600000,"06 27, 2001",2001,1636,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Betty', 'waitress', 'Yes', 'waitress', 'Oh', 'be', 'nurse', 'being', 'nurse', 'world', 'favorite', 'soap', 'opera', 'quot', 'A', 'Reason', 'Love', 'quot', 'even', 'love', 'character', 'show', 'named', 'David', 'Ravell', 'Apart', 'dreams', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'husband', 'cheating', 'scum', 'bag', 'who', 'alone', 'birthday', 'When', 'Betty', 'horrible', 'crime', 'shock', 'world', 'quot', 'A', 'Reason', 'Love', 'quot', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'sets', 'off', 'find', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'Doctor', 'David', 'Ravell.My', 'Opinion', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'was', 'lot', 'different', 'expected', 'fact', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quot', 'Dark', 'Comedy', 'quot', 'correctly', 'close', 'comedic', 'parts', 'violent', 'serious', 'parts', 'violent', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'serious', 'are', 'surrounded', 'lighter', 'scenes', 'Betty', 'life', 'quite', 'sad', 'beginning', 'film', 'transformation', 'out', 'true', 'self', 'very', 'intelligent', 'creative', 'movie', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'best', 'one', 'Renee', 'Zellweger.DVD', 'Quality', 'Widescreen', 'anamorphic', '2.25:1', 'DD5.1', 'Good', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'Two', 'separate', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'quot', 'A', 'Reason', 'Love', 'quot', 'trailers', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'really', 'Should', 'Do', 'See', 'can', 'handle', 'off', 'beat', 'movies', 'bit', 'different', 'mainstream', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'are', 'film', 'buff', 'general', 'enjoy', 'intelligent', 'movies', 'then', 'are', 'treat.Related', 'DVDs', 'Check', 'Out', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou']",N/A

Part drama, part comedy (and both Freeman and Chris Rock are hilarious in a not very intentionally funny way), and part suspense murder chase -- plus a subplot about psychologically dysfunctionally fantasy of Hollywood.I read other reviews here and the one reason some critics savage this movie is that it defies all the usual by-the-numbers stereotypes. Sure, the theme is somewhat doozy but the way it has been handled on film is immaculate -- the movie flows quickly and is edge-of-the-seat entertainment and almost all characters are very convincing -- from the quirky small-town Kansas sheriff to the protagonists Renee and Freeman.In fact, I particularly enjoyed the protagonists, their stories intertwine in an offbeat way. He fantasizes about her as she fantasizes about a soap star. They both set off in pursuit of their ideals with unpredictable results.  Renee is sweet without being smarmy, there is a naivete to her in this which is not cloying. And Morgan has seen better days and is the victim of his own lifestyle which he would leave in a second if his fantasy were possible and a deep part of him knows it is not.The underlying almost parodic message is about how we get sidetracked in life when some thing becomes too painful through just plain circumstances or through poor decisions. Pay attention to the words spoken by Morgan Freeman's character in his last scene.Its fun to watch movies that take risks and this sly dig definitely does!

571821,A1VGVMUOI5FHTE,B0000584ZG,"""snootchiebootchies""","[0, 0]","After only two films, I had already considered Neil LaBute to be one of America's sharpest and most cynical social critics and satirists.  However, this is his first film based on somebody else's script and even though the social critique and satire is still there, it is overly familiar and not as incisive as I would expect from a LaBute film.  Perhaps I'm too tough on him.  If this film had been directed by anyone else, I might very well be singing its praises.  That's because the movie is actually very funny and involving, with a storyline that exists on several different levels.  I guess I just expected more from LaBute.  I think he can do so much more than recycle the accidental-celebrity-type story straight out from 'Being There'.  I also think LaBute is more interesting when he is cynical and mean-spirited.  The happy, morally-correct ending in which all the loose ends are tied up is something you would expect from a typical Hollywood shill, not a maverick such as LaBute.  And is there really a need for another social critique on the deleterious effects of television on American life?  The plot has more than its share of contrivances, but give LaBute credit for getting as much mileage from them as possible, although I still could have done without the Crispin Glover and Pruitt Taylor Vince characters.  The strong performances from Zelweger, Kinnear and Freeman also go a long way in selling the implausible plot twists (perhaps my complaints about the unrealistic plot might seem irrational to some as the film can be seen as a fable, but I would argue that one cannot remain emotionally detached after witnessing a gruesome scalping).  I should also mention that there are many wickedly funny scenes in the film, particularly those involving the delusional Betty and the equally delusional Dr. Ravell.",3,Doesn't have the bite normally expected from a LaBute film,992390400,"06 13, 2001",2001,1830,"['only', 'two', 'films', 'had', 'already', 'considered', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'be', 'one', 'America', 'sharpest', 'most', 'cynical', 'social', 'critics', 'satirists', 'However', 'first', 'film', 'based', 'somebody', 'else', 'script', 'even', 'social', 'critique', 'satire', 'still', 'there', 'overly', 'familiar', 'not', 'as', 'incisive', 'would', 'expect', 'LaBute', 'film', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'too', 'tough', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'anyone', 'else', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'singing', 'praises', 'movie', 'actually', 'very', 'funny', 'involving', 'storyline', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'guess', 'just', 'expected', 'more', 'LaBute', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'recycle', 'accidental-celebrity-type', 'story', 'straight', 'out', ""'Being"", 'also', 'think', 'LaBute', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'cynical', 'mean-spirited', 'happy', 'morally-correct', 'ending', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'something', 'would', 'expect', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'shill', 'not', 'maverick', 'such', 'LaBute', 'really', 'need', 'social', 'critique', 'deleterious', 'effects', 'television', 'American', 'life', 'plot', 'more', 'share', 'contrivances', 'give', 'LaBute', 'credit', 'getting', 'as', 'much', 'mileage', 'possible', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'characters', 'strong', 'performances', 'Zelweger', 'Kinnear', 'Freeman', 'also', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'selling', 'implausible', 'plot', 'twists', 'perhaps', 'complaints', 'unrealistic', 'plot', 'might', 'seem', 'irrational', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'fable', 'would', 'argue', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'remain', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'witnessing', 'gruesome', 'scalping', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'are', 'many', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'particularly', 'involving', 'delusional', 'Betty', 'equally', 'delusional', 'Dr.', 'Ravell']",N/A

I found this movie mesmerizing.  We wanted to cook dinner and watch the movie at the same time, but the story was so compelling that dinner had to wait.  I watched this movie with a group of people and all of us were glued to the screen to see what happened next.  We all wondered what kept us watching, but whatever it was, we could not miss a word.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger portrays a lonely young woman who views the world and all of its harsh realities with ""rose colored glasses"".  When she witnesses the ghastly &amp; frightening murder of her husband she separates herself from reality and focuses on the only thing in her life that brings her any comfort and that is her television soap opera.  Betty believes that she must go to California and find her Doctor.  I thought that this was completely in line with her character.  Betty has put a positive spin on her entire life up to this point and in the midst of tragedy, the only positives she can find are in an alternate reality, that she creates for herself.  She meets several interesting characters in her quest for her fantasy, and they all believe that she is crazy.  The entire cast here did an excellent job.  Morgan Freeman was outstanding.My biggest criticism of the movie was the language.  It did not need ALL of the expletives that were used.  I can understand some harsh language tossed in now and again to make a point, but when most of the characters can't seem to articulate a sentence without extreme profanity, I have to wonder where they were educated.

Her husband (Del) is a car dealer/drug dealer who cheats on her. One day while Betty is watching her soap in one room, two bad guys, Morgan Freeman and his son Chris Rock, lean on Del who was attempting to sell them back the drugs he stole from them.

She blocks out the killing while believing she is the former fiancee of the fictional Dr. David Ravell and embarks on a cross country trip to find him. Meanwhile, the local cops want to question her, and the killers realizing they have a witness want to kill her.The movie is zany as the relationship between Morgan, an intellectual killer with class and Chris Rock, a hip-hopster becomes strained. Morgan believes Betty to be cold and calculating and develops a love and respect for her as they travel,while Rock thinks she is just plain crazy.

The critics were mostly in high praise of it, but the average movie going audience opted to go see something else. And why was this? Because people do not have any idea what is good and what is bad.This film was a terrific look at the lengths someone could go to seek out their idealized life. Renee Zellweger does a fantastic job as Betty, a waitress whose husband treats her terrible so she loses herself into the soap opera world. She is completely in love with Greg Kinear, who also does a great job as the phony doctor and the actor who is a true jerk.

It's certainly not the movie's fault, of course, but I wouldn't really define Nurse Betty as a comedy exactly.  There are lots of funny moments, but there's more of an adventure movie feel in the getting there.  There are moments of surprisingly graphic violence (especially in the outtakes on the DVD) and a kind of dark undertone to the scenes with Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock.  Zellweger is inspired as Betty, as is Freeman in his role.  Rock doesn't bring much new.  If that's never been a problem, it won't be now (and vice versa, of course).  Kind of quirky, unique story makes the film very engaging, though there are many moments that are kind of hard to believe.

I have to say that the story is original.  And just for that fact, I really love this movie.  Not only does it have one of the best casts that has been in a movie for awhile, but the movie is really funny.  The story focuses on Betty (Zellweger), a house wife who works on occasion at the local town diner.  She is also obsessed with a soap opera called A Reason to Love.  Mainly she is in love with the main star of the show, Greg Kinnear.  When her car dealer husband is axed, Betty loses it and goes into a state of shock.  From then on the movie is one funny romp that evokes more than a few laughs.

571831,A2GR3LJ5HEYY1M,B0000584ZG,xyz,"[4, 6]","Seldom does a movie combine the tragic and comic elements as well as ""Nurse Betty."" To say that this is a story about pursuit of dreams is to focus only on the first half of the movie. It's about a bit more. It's a story about a person coming of age and pursuing her dream AWAKE.Betty (brilliantly played by Zellweger) had been pursuing her dream ever since her husband, Del (Eckhart), was killed. She left Kansas City for LA in search of Dr. Ravell (Kinnear) whom she believed to be her ex-finance. All went pretty well until her dreamy pursuit of dream finally ended with an ugly scene in which George the actor playing Dr. Ravell was cruelly reprimanding Betty for her inability to act. Only after then did Betty wake up and go back to her real (but new) life. The final scene of the movie showed Betty enjoying herself in Rome. And that's really the dream that she should have been pursuing.A similar message was manifested through another character, Charlie the hit man played by Morgan Freeman. Though even he himself admitted he was a ""garbage man of human condition,"" Charlie was dreaming of an unrealistic future with Betty. He tracked her down more because of his admiration for her than for the drug stashed in Betty's car. In the end, he had to pay the price for his dreamy pursuit of his impossible dream. Not only him but also his son was killed.While pursuing one's own dream is a good thing, it could be dangerous if one is not awake and only blindly follows his impulse. It's important to draw the distinction between the real world and the imagined world. It's easy to be led to chase dreams in the perfect, simple imagined world. But what distinguishes an achiever from a pure dreamer is the ability to recognize, accept and reconcile the imperfection of the real world and resist the temptation to keep oneself locked in a dream.Besides the delicious blend of tragic and comic elements, the movie also offers some great performances of its cast. Zellweger is almost impeccable. Freeman, as usual, does a tremendous job and Rock is seriously funny.
