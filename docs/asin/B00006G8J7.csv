715275,APB7DD3MXUTR2,B00006G8J7,,"[6, 6]","I'm as prone as the next Boomer to waxing endlessly nostalgiac about the sixties-seventies TV of my childhood, particularly the great sitcoms of the era... but I have to admit that the past decade and a half or so have produced some truly great new classics, and ""Malcolm in the Middle"" can take its place at or near the top of the list.This insanely funny family comedy was created by the versatile Linwood Boomer, who as writer-producer made witty contributions to series such as ""Night Court"" and ""3rd Rock From the Sun"" and in his hunky young actor days was once best known as the blind husband of Melissa Sue Anderson on the Michael Landon family drama ""Little House on the Prairie."" ""Malcolm"" is reportedly loosely based on Boomer's own life (!), and in this DVD collection there are so many wonderfully written episodes and memorable moments of expertly executed lunacy--here a sampling of mine:Pilot Episode: When couch potatoes Malcolm, older brother Reese and little brother Dewey all decline to move to answer the insistently ringing front doorbell their mother, an exasperated--and obviously topless--Lois (who was moments ago trying to locate her bra as she hurriedly dressed for work), flings it open to find a startled school counselor on her doorstep. (A snippet of this moment can be seen in the opening theme montage)""New Neighbors"" (Season 2): Headstrong eldest son Francis and his fellow military school Cadets, in full dress, are led by their autocratic Commandant Spangler in a hilariously sprightly choral performance of the old Sammy Davis Jr./Mike Curb Congregation pop classic ""Candyman"" in honor of the impending visit of Spangler's hero, Colonel Oliver North.""Monkey"" (Season 3): An injured and temporarily wheelchair-bound Craig Feldspar (Lois's Lucky Aide co-worker) must be rescued by his ""rival"" Hal when he realizes that the Capuchin helper monkey who had been taking care of his needs has turned on him and is now trying to kill him.""If Boys Were Girls"": During a trip to the mall a beleagured Lois, now expecting child #5, daydreams that her brawling, battling sons were well-behaved lady-like daughters instead; meanwhile in another part of the mall an increasingly desperate Hal attempts to find the perfect Valentine's gift for Lois--and resorts to repeatedly stealing the bags of another mall shopper to do it; and""Day Care"" (both Season 4): Now that baby Jamie has arrived Hal and Lois are desperate to find affordable care for him. They discover a neighborhood church offers free day care services to its members, so they pretend to be a Christian family from another town's sister congregation in order to qualify; meanwhile, in a spiritual instruction class, their dimbulb son Reese spies a painting of Elijah being taken up to Heaven by a chariot of fire and is inspired to recreate the holy experience for himself with a lawn chair and a bunch of attached balloons. He (briefly) ascends upward singing a mangled version of ""Amazing Grace"" as Dewey watches in wonder and calls up to him sweetly ""I'll miss you, at first!""You get the idea. Malcolm finds in his neurotic and hyper-articulate Krelboyne classmates Lloyd and Dabney, and especially his asthmatic, wheel-chair-bound and very droll African-American best friend Stevie (Craig Lamar Traylor is truly affecting with... his... gasping...pauses), another family of sorts, one as amusingly dysfunctional as his own. His dad, Hal, bonds with Stevie's loving, over-protective dad, Abe, joining him in evening poker games with friends (all Gentlemen of Color, whom Hal eventually accuses of looking down on him because he's the only... NON-PROFESSIONAL in the group!) And David Anthony Higgins (who also co-starred in ""Ellen"") steals every single scene he's in as Lucky Aide manager Craig, hopelessly smitten with Lois and prepared to submit to every humiliation--and mean trick at the hands of her scheming boys--to be near her. His panic, in the face of the worker revolt Hal leads against him at Lucky Aide (to the marching beat of Phil Collins's ""Sussudio""), is priceless.The kids (star Frankie Muniz as the hapless Malcolm, Christopher Masterson as rebellious big brother Francis, Justin Berfield as second oldest idiot-bully Reese, and particularly Erik Per Sullivan as Dewey, the smarter-than-he-looks, sweet oddball kid brother) are all letter perfect in their realistic sibling rivalries, but to me it's the parents who deserve special mention: Jane Kaczmarek is the perfect modern TV mom--harassed, embattled, controlling, perpetually weary, yet loving and fiercely devoted to her wayward family. The scene (cannot at this moment recall the Season or episode; sorry) in which in the midst of a typical battle of wills with the equally stubborn Francis her eyes suddenly fill with tears and she apologizes, acknowledging that when he was little she was not the mother to him she should have been, will put a lump in your throat no matter how many times you see it. And Bryan Cranston is a revelation as the scattered, semi-ineffectual and utterly put-upon husband and father who nevertheless manages to pull himself together and come through for his family in spite of himself; he simply adores the mother of his children, not minding a whit that very possibly he loves her more than she loves him. With his loyalty, basic decency, and moments of gentleness he is the show's beating heart.In later seasons look for recurrent apppearances from veteran scene-stealers like Cloris Leachman (as Ida, Lois's appalling monster-mom) and Kenneth Mars (as Otto, Francis's sweet-natured German dude-ranch employer), and delightful guest turns from the talented likes of Susan Sarandon, Bea Arthur, Stephen Root and Patrick Warburton, among others.",5,Simply Sublime Sitcom Silliness,1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,5741,"[""'m"", 'as', 'prone', 'next', 'Boomer', 'waxing', 'endlessly', 'nostalgiac',

I enjoy a lot of good sitcoms (Frasier, I Love Lucy, Fawlty Towers, Everybody Loves Raymond, The Golden Girls, The Andy Griffith Show, The Simpsons) but this would be my 'desert island' show. For consistent laughs (with 151 amazing episodes) it gets the number one spot, bar none. It was so witty, clever, crazy, inventive, subversive, unpredictable, and delightfully silly. The writing is amazing. Every episode features terrific slapstick and ridiculous fun. You never know what's going to happen next.Sadly, it seems we probably won't be seeing a release of seasons 2-7. A roadblock of sorts must have come up; probably expensive rights to the numerous songs featured during the show's run. The first season sold well, so I'm sure the studio was anxious to sell subsequent seasons. It's a shame, really. Nobody wins in these cases, not the customers, the studios, or the musical artists and their reps.I have been recording episodes off cable. Sure, there are bootleg dvd sets available for purchase on the internet. However, most of them consist of a seven disc set. Think about that. That's seven seasons, one season per disc. Incredible. They must have jammed around 20 epsiodes on each disc. The picture and sound quality must be unbearable. The more content you put on a blank dvd, the worse the quality.The only benefit of those sets would be the lack of commercials, and I'm sure the editing is substandard. So, beware if you are considering such a purchase.If you've never seen the show, try to catch reruns on cable. You'll be glad you did.

715285,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00006G8J7,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[12, 12]","A great comedy series come few and far between in these current times of television. Even then, most of them are the same. What a blessing and a breath of fresh air ""Malcolm In The Middle"" was when it debuted a few years ago. This family was far from perfect. They weren't clean or in control. It has been said that this is like a live action version of ""The Simpsons"". That sounds about right. All 16 episodes of the first season are presented here in full screen format(thank god!). Each episode is rich with inspired comedic performances and hilarious and clever writing and direction. It's the first comedy to come along that has made me laugh out loud in years. The series is about Malcolm(Frankie Muniz), the middle child of a crazy family. He speaks to the camera while all of the zaniness goes on around him. He's usually a target for his older brother Reese(played by Justin Berfield), who's an obnoxious bully who always has an idea to cause mayhem or inflict some kind of pain and horror on his younger brothers. Ahhh, big brothers. Then there is little Dewey(Erik Per Sullivan), the baby of the three. Dewey is hard to explain. He doesn't say a whole lot. There is a fourth brother named Francis(played by Christopher Masterson), who has been shipped off to military school, which is where we see him throughout the entire season. I have saved the two best for the very last. Mom Lois(the brilliant Jane Kaczmarek), and doofy dad Hal(the equally brilliant Bryan Cranston). These two are unlike any parents seen on TV in a while. Lois is like a dictator. She is smart. She's tough. She knows when the kids are giving her BS and she doesn't take it. She has a way with punishing them. She knows her stuff. She seems to be the one of the two that is in control of the household and the family. Hal is like a big child himself. The punishing and everything is more Lois' department. He likes to have fun with the boys. He's a very likeable schlub who never seems to get a break. When he does, something goes wrong. These are two extremely interesting and brilliantly performed characters. Why these two haven't won emmy's yet is anyone's guess. The episodes themselves are classic. You can't go wrong with any of them. There are a few standout episodes on the disc. They are all standouts, but these are the best. ""Krelboyne Picnic"" takes place at a kid's party. Nothing goes right. The entertainers' acts bomb, families get into fights, and Hal serves up some less than desireable food. A good one. ""Funeral"" has Malcolm having a date, but is stuck having to go to a relative's funeral. He tries to scheme his way out of the ceremony. ""Cheerleader"" has Reese falling for a teasing cheerleader. He even joins her squad to be close to her and impress her. The two best episodes come late in the season. The first one being ""Rollerskates"". This is the episode that really made me worship the show. The episode that made this a can't miss show. Malcolm wants to rollerskate. This is music to Hal's ears. He teaches Malcolm all these techniques that only annoy Malcolm. The scene with Hal doing his schtick to the song ' Funkytown' is priceless. A classic gut buster. Perfect. The other episode is the season finale of which I forget the title of it. The family goes to a theme water park. In the meantime, Dewey is babysat by an older lady. The babysitter is played Bea Arthur. The scene with the two of them dancing to the ABBA hit 'Fernando' is another priceless scene until...well, that would be telling. Every other episode is great, but these are my favorites. ""Malcolm"" is zany, wild fun. But it's intelligently written and performed. It's a show for the ages.

715287,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00006G8J7,Caleb Williams,"[4, 4]","When Malcolm in the Middle first hit American TV screens it was something that was never seen before, it was a family not of the typical American lot... or are they? They got massive ratings for the first season and rightfully so, it gave is an incredibly funny depiction of real American family life. It's nothing like any other sitcom you've seen, all the characters don't make up at the end and we don't get a message of life shoved in our face. It's simply just funny because a lot of it is so true, yet so bizarre.The show focuses around middle child genius Malcolm (hence the name) and his dysfunctional family. It chronicles his struggles being the most intelligent person in his family of misfits and his relationship with his mother, father and brothers. From time to time we're treated to Malcolm's monologues, generally him spouting his distaste for how his family are together. Frankie Muniz plays the part well and for the years that the show ran for he managed to keep the character consistent.The family consist of Lois (the mother) she's crazy, plain and simple. She's the worst mother we could possibly imaging having, she's strict, she's stubborn and worst of all she's always right. Hal (The dad) he's the weakest one of the lot, he's pretty dumb and easily manipulated which the boys are very familiar with. Francis (the oldest brother) he was sent to military school by Lois for simply getting in too much trouble. Being in military school doesn't stop him from being the prankster though. Reece (second oldest) he's an idiot and one of the main reasons why the boys are always in trouble as his usual ""cunning"" schemes never work. Dewey (the youngest) he just stays out of the way and when he does get involved he's the usual annoying little brother.This is truly an amazing and original sitcom and I was forced to just be general about the show as no further seasons have been released. I'm happy to hear that season 2 may be on the way and hopefully further seasons will follow onto DVD. By far my favourite character has to be Hal, his craziness and quite childish personality make him one of the funniest characters in a sitcom.",5,Incredibly Funny,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,2154,"['When', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'first', 'hit', 'American', 'TV', 'screens', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'never', 'seen', 'was', 'family', 'not', 'typical', 'American', 'lot', 'are', 'got', 'massive', 'ratings', 'first', 'season', 'rightfully', 'so', 'gave', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'depiction', 'real', 'American', 'family', 'life', 'nothing', 'other', 'sitcom', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'message', 'life', 'shoved', 'face', 'simply', 'just', 'funny', 'lot', 'so', 'true', 'yet', 'bizarre.The', 'show', 'middle', 'child', 'genius', 'Malcolm', 'hence', 'name', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'struggles', 'being', 'most', 'intelligent', 'person', 'family', 'misfits', 'relationship', 'mother', 'father', 'brothers', 'time', 'time', ""'re"", 'treated', 'Malcolm', 'monologues', 'generally', 'spouting', 'distaste', 'how', 'family', 'are', 'together', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'part', 'well', 'years', 'show', 'ran', 'managed', 'keep', 'character', 'consistent.The', 'family', 'consist', 'Lois', 'mother', 'crazy', 'plain', 'simple', 'worst', 'mother', 'could', 'possibly', 'imaging', 'having', 'strict', 'stubborn', 'worst', 'always', 'right', 'Hal', 'dad', 'weakest', 'one', 'lot', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'boys', 'are', 'very', 'familiar', 'Francis', 'oldest', 'brother', 'was', 'sent', 'military', 'school', 'Lois', 'simply', 'getting', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'Being', 'military', 'school', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'prankster', 'Reece', 'second', 'oldest', 'idiot', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'why', 'boys', 'are', 'always', 'trouble', 'usual', 'cunning', 'schemes', 'never', 'work', 'Dewey', 'youngest', 'just', 'way', 'when', 'get', 'involved', 'usual', 'annoying', 'little', 'brother.This', 'truly', 'amazing', 'original', 'sitcom', 'was', 'forced', 'just', 'be', 'general', 'show', 'further', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', ""'m"", 'happy', 'hear', 'season', '2', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'hopefully', 'further', 'seasons', 'will', 'follow', 'DVD', 'far', 'favourite', 'character', 'be', 'Hal', 'craziness', 'quite', 'childish', 'personality', 'make', 'one', 'funniest', 'characters', 'sitcom']",Malcolm in the Middle: Season 1

He plays Hal the father.Much to my astonishment, Cranston is capable of playing a delightful and beloved comic character.  He is Hal, the hapless but loving father in a fiercely matriarchal family of boys led by his wife Lois. They have four sons when we open and these sons are capable of the worst mischief at home or in school.  They are the scourge of the neighborhood and the school.

My family certainly wasn't like that. I adore my siblings, and now that I'm 23 I get along much better with my parents than I did as a pre-teen, or even worse, as a teen.Unlike many sitcoms of the past, I can identify much easier with Malcolm in the Middle. I'm the oldest of my family, but I can feel for Malcolm, because a lot of what he goes through at school happened to me as well. The tale of a boy genius with a knack for getting into trouble is a very personal tale to me, and so Malcolm in The Middle very quickly became my favorite TV sitcom... a genre I usually avoid like the plague. Finally a normal family is on the airwave, and they're so normal it actually makes me appreciate my family a lot more!Its funny how everyone says at the moment that one day you'll look back and laugh... This is true. Suddenly the stuff I used to get into trouble for is hilarious, as were my parent&#65533;s clever punishments. My family and I watch this show and laugh while we compare notes on what happened when we were kids. My mom denied that she's a lot like Louis until she saw the episode where she found her red dress burnt and in the toilet... the clever, but not physically violent disciplinary actions were nearly identical to an incident involving me and some ceramics my mom bought... except in my story, I was the guilty party, not my dad...It&#65533;s easy for me to declare Malcolm in the Middle the funniest show on TV, simply because of its slapstick view of otherwise serious issues. The show makes light of the average American family, and succeeds in getting the point across... even the insanely brilliant can do stupid things.",5,Finally!

It was one of those ""nothing else is on and I've never seen this.""  I was very pleased I gave it a chance!  This is one of the funniest family sitcoms on TV now.  Some may not like to admit it, but this show does portray a family close to the 'norm'.  I think that makes it even better!This show centers around a middle-class 'All-American' family who has their share of dysfunctional moments.  Both parents work to support their family of four boys.  The oldest is sent to military school early in the first season, but he remains very much a part of each episode's plot.  The other three boys are a handful to say the least.  I guess this is just one of those shows that reminds you of so many people you know, and that adds to the humor!Naturally, after watching from the 2005 season I wondered what started the craze, so I had to buy the Season 1 DVD set.

But, it is true, this is the most functionally dysfunctional family on earth.  No counselor, no psychologist, not even psychiatrist could tame the insanity.  The cast is great.  Malcolm, played by Frankie Muniz, narrates the show and gives it an amazingly funny perspective.  Lois, the mother, is outrageously funny, she is insane and quintessential to the show. Hal, the father, is a bit of a bumbling idiot, but in a harmless and good way.  Francis, the eldest child, advises from afar his little brothers on the inner-workings of their mother.  Reese, the second child, older brother of Malcolm, is a bit of an idiot too.  Driven by anything that would torment those around him, he gets himself into a great deal of trouble.  Then, finally, there is Dewey. He is the youngest, he manages to get lost regularly.  He does things that would get an average 6 year old killed.The first season is hilarious.  It is great to see how the show progressed from the pilot to the Emmy winner.

The expanded ""Pilot"" is classic comedy TV. (though it is a pity they don't give us the pilot as aired, for comparison)  ""Red Dress"" shows us that Lois is capable of being played as being more than a harridan.  And ""Krelboyne Picnic"", one of the few episodes beyond the pilot to really use Malcolm's genius for plot purposes, is hysterical while defying political correctness at every turn.Of the added features, the director's commentary is the most useful.  It isn't always just the director, the actors are given their shot at talking to us, as well.  It is at least amusing, and often instructive, to listen.  For example, the thick body hair on Brian Cranston in the pilot was yak hair, and he met the boys while wearing only a sock (er, in a strategic position, not on the foot).These DVDs are further evidence that TV show producers are seeing DVDs as the means by which their works are going down to posterity, and they are giving us their best.",5,Contains all the best episodes you remember,1038614400,"11 30, 2002",2002,1195,"['first', 'season', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'was', 'decidedly', 'best', 'when', 'boys', 'where', 'young', 'enough', 'things', 'did', 'were', 'cute', 'rather', 'delinquency', 'when', 'were', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'explore.And', 'explore', 'did', 'expanded', 'Pilot', 'classic', 'comedy', 'TV', 'pity', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'pilot', 'aired', 'comparison', 'Red', 'Dress', 'Lois', 'capable', 'being', 'played', 'being', 'more', 'harridan', 'Krelboyne', 'Picnic', 'one', 'few', 'episodes', 'pilot', 'really', 'use', 'Malcolm', 'genius', 'plot', 'purposes', 'hysterical', 'defying', 'political', 'correctness', 'turn.Of', 'added', 'features', 'director', 'commentary', 'most', 'useful', ""n't"", 'always', 'just', 'director', 'actors', 'are', 'given', 'shot', 'talking', 'as', 'well', 'least', 'amusing', 'often', 'instructive', 'listen', 'example', 'thick', 'body', 'hair', 'Brian', 'Cranston', 'pilot', 'was', 'yak', 'hair', 'met', 'boys', 'wearing', 'only', 'sock', 'er', 'strategic', 'position', 'not', 'foot', '.These', 'DVDs', 'are', 'further', 'evidence', 'TV', 'show', 'producers', 'are', 'seeing', 'DVDs', 'means', 'works', 'are', 'going', 'posterity', 'are', 'giving', 'best']",Malcolm in the Middle: Season 1

Because the episodes are less than half an hour, we're not locking them into a long commitment.  Not to worry - after watching the pilot episode, they always beg for more.  Even though as hosts we've seen Malcolm repeatedly - and usually I'm not much for repeat viewing - we still laugh like crazy, sharing our guests' delight.  Only one couple was not amused, and we weren't surprised. (Thank God they're only once a year!)Occasionally we watch the current episodes.  I'm reluctant, because I hate to see the kids grow up.  I know it's inevitable, but leaving that wonderful ""first season"" is kind of like leaving your own childhood - at the time you're glad you've finally grown up, but before long you're longing to return.  Anyway, with that sentimental caveat, I just wanted to say, that the quality of the series has been maintained - it's still hilarious!So I predict, that Malcolm in the Middle will take it's place, along with the Honeymooners and Andy Griffith and Mary Tyler Moore, in the pantheon of all-time television comedy classics.

It's the characters that really shine in this show. Why? Because they are very, very relatable. Now I'm not saying that every family is as crazy as this, although mine certainly is. Everybody, and I mean everybody can relate to both of the boys, Malcolm and Reese. With Malcolm we've always felt like the outsider a little bit and with Reese, well we've always been the wild child at times and the one who gets in trouble, at least I have. And not wanting to dwell on my family too much, but the mother was like a carbon copy of mine. And older brother who's only a year older is identical to Reese. But I don't think your family has to be identical to this one for you to like the show, it just has a general appeal. The acting is superb, and it really makes you believe that these people have been living together and growing up with one another for years.

So, when a friend of mine handed me this DVD set and said ""You've got to see this show"", I got my first taste of ""Malcolm In The Middle""...and was completely hooked.This show is not only funny and original, but it seems to strike a familiar chord with childhood memories.  Not only mine, but also everyone that I've discussed this series with.  Although the family in the series appears (at first glance, anyway) to be thoroughly dysfunctional, they grow on you as the series progresses.  I began to recognize bits and pieces of my own childhood, whether it was some absurd thing said by one of my parents, a kid-like caper pulled off in school, or some friend that I had that didn't quite ""fit in"".  I can relate to this show.The writing is excellent and extremely funny, even managing to put valuable life lessons across, without being heavy handed.  The acting is top notch, reminiscent of ""Family Ties"" and ""Home Improvement"" in its ensemble cast chemistry and tightness.  And, although a surprise, I found the unique innovation of not including a laugh track to be refreshing, allowing me to decide what was funny (almost everything), rather than trying to force me down the road of simulated amusement.The DVD set is a great value.  Fantastic transfers (as best as I can tell, without ever having seen an actual broadcast), great sound, and jam packed with special features.  There's about 3 hours of commentary for selected scenes, a bloopers reel, 4 unaired opening scenes, 4 deleted scenes, and a handful of ""promos"".  There are also 3 fairly interesting featurettes covering the show itself, the crew, and a day in the life of ""Dewey"" (Eric Per Sullivan).  The only lame feature of the entire set was a small section called ""MalcolmVision"", which was basically just some framing goofs as a result of the program's shooting in a 16X9 format.  An incredibly small negative for what is overwhelmingly an outstanding boxed set.Good show, good price, and exceptional entertainment...You just can't go wrong with this series.

And, goodness gracious, I was floored by the quality and consistency of the show.  So, when these DVDs went on sale, I had to have them.  And...I was speechless.  Absolutely fabulous.  Easily one of the greatest comedies of all time, and on the short list of best family shows of any kind.Particularly fantastic was the episode ""Smunday.""  They easily blew through 3 or 4 plot twists, and at the climax of the episode I was literally gasping from horror, laughter and shock.  Hilarious!  Also, the sight gags on this show are funny, slightly exaggeratedly (hence the humor) and always with a touch of tenderness that highlights why family relationships are complex and unique and beautiful, even when their shameless and dysfunctional.  I think the episode ""Malcolm Babysits"" highlights this nicely, when Malcolm in babysitting for the ""ideal"" family, while his family is their own neighborhood's live Jerry Springer show, while camping in a trailer while their house is getting fumigated.  Sure, we know the moral is that there is no place like home, but the lesson isn't forced and is very entertaining.  Far from didactic, you barely notice between the humor.  And the young cast together are astonishingly good actors.  Muniz, in particular, handles his duplicitous ""real-life"" versus talking to the camera with a fluidity that I think most adults wouldn't be able to sell.The extras are very enlightening as well with the voice-over commentary (although Frankie Mu&ntilde;iz in real life is a long-winded gasbag).

Malcolm is a boy who is diagnosed as a genius and put into a ""special class"" for the gifted and talented at school.  He is a very smart boy who provides the insight and vision for this show.  The character narrates the episodes and we generally see his family and school through his eyes though not exclusively.  The family consists of parents and 4 boys whom the mother tries to keep under as much control as possible.  The oldest son has gotten into trouble and has been sent off to Alabama to attend a strict military boys school.  The next child is a boy who is destructive for no apparent reason and can't explain why, he says that he doesn't know why he does what he does but knows he doesn't want to get caught.  Malcolm is the 3rd boy and Dewey is the youngest, a boy that is influenced by TV commercials and easily led by his older brothers into troublesome tasks.  The father is half man, half boy and acts as a friend to his sons and only occasionally as a parent.

(I rarely watch commercial TV, and I prefer HBO on Sunday nights.) So I'm speaking up for all of you who may not have gotten into MITM - you need to get this DVD and catch up on what you've been missing!!!This show has a wonderful mix of great writing, acting, and vision. I ""got it"" right away, to the point where I could anticipate what was happening next - which in no way destroyed the fun for me. The extended pilot had one of the biggest laughs for me, and I've forced my entire family to watch it for the pivotal, climactic scene. So far it's put everyone in the ""laugh until your gut hurts, slam your hand down over and over"" realm, or as we used to say in chatrooms, ROFLOLPIP.Malcom's world is instantly recognizable even to those who had ""normal"" families. Raising 4 boys is quite a trial - my best friend grew up wtih 4 brothers, so I got to witness the craziness and even add to it. The mother is forced to be as tough as a marine sergeant, and I for one sympathise with her because the father is so totally ineffectual, yet still manages to be loveable. And I too was in a special gifted class for part of each school day, but luckily, as a girl I wasn't tortured too much. :)The series never gets too sentimental, yet there are real moments of poignancy, such as when Malcolm connects with Stevie, a wheelchair-bound asthmatic. This character is amazingly done, you just have to love him. The focus of each show tends to split between Malcom's life at school, home, and then there's his older brother at military school, a whole other world, so it's really an ensemble cast. This allows for much more complex plots and diverse scenarios.I'm really tired of the entire sit-com set up with its typical two sets filmed with three cameras, live audience augmented with phony laughter, with typical plots like ""the big lie."" It's just been done so many times I can't pay attention anymore.Malcolm, however, re-invents the sit-com by using a single steadicam, extreme closeups, NO laugh track (yippee!), special effects, and direct interaction with the camera, so the audience ends up feeling like Malcolm's best friend as he shares the thoughts he cannot share with anyone else. Emotionally, you're right there with everyone else. No other sit-com gives the audience this experience.

When I originally viewed &quot;Malcolm&quot; on TV, I found myself laughing out loud every few seconds at the clever, witty jokes from the cast and writers, which is what prompted me to grab the DVD. But, upon a repeated viewing, the episodes don't hit me the same way any more. &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; is a show that works because you have no idea what will happen next. Anything can, and often will, happen. That said, when you've seen the episodes and know how each joke will turn out, the comedy starts to wear thin. A lot of the material isn't quite as memorable as I once gave it credit for, which I found slightly disappointing. The best episodes on the disc were unfortunatly the ones I missed during the initial run. Maybe I have to give it a little more time, but while the show is similiar to The Simpsons, it still doesn't have its classic, collectible appeal.If you plan on picking up &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, it's worth the money in terms of what it gives you. FOX gives its fans some pretty good season sets of its TV shows. Just find an episode guide on the internet first and see if the season 1 episodes still pique your interest.",3,"Great presentation, but...",1036454400,"11 5, 2002",2002,1832,"['quot', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'quot', 'hit', 'series', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'quot', 'Simpsons', 'quot', 'live-action', 'form', 'such', 'recent', 'series', 'quot', 'Malcolm', 'quot', 'found', 'way', 'DVD', 'quite', 'early', 'plans', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'release', 'season', '2', 'next', 'year', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'decent', 'TV', 'series', 'video', 'not', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'even', 'was', 'filmed', 'such', 'explained', 'DVD', 'are', 'good', 'handful', 'extras', 'such', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'select', 'commentary', 'gag', 'reel', 'more.However', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'strongly', 'can', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'even', 'solid', 'presentation', 'When', 'originally', 'viewed', 'quot', 'Malcolm', 'quot', 'TV', 'found', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'few', 'seconds', 'clever', 'witty', 'jokes', 'cast', 'writers', 'what', 'prompted', 'grab', 'DVD', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'same', 'way', 'more', 'quot', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'quot', 'show', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'Anything', 'can', 'often', 'will', 'happen', 'said', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'know', 'how', 'joke', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'comedy', 'wear', 'thin', 'lot', 'material', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'memorable', 'once', 'gave', 'credit', 'found', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'best', 'episodes', 'disc', 'were', 'unfortunatly', 'ones', 'missed', 'initial', 'run', 'Maybe', 'have', 'give', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'show', 'similiar', 'Simpsons', 'still', ""n't"", 'have', 'classic', 'collectible', 'appeal.If', 'plan', 'picking', 'up', 'quot', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'quot', 'money', 'terms', 'what', 'FOX', 'fans', 'pretty', 'good', 'season', 'sets', 'TV', 'shows', 'Just', 'find', 'episode', 'guide', 'internet', 'first', 'see', 'season', '1', 'episodes', 'still', 'pique', 'interest']",Malcolm in the Middle: Season 1
715343,A345CAZWU272WJ,B00006G8J7,SMB,"[3, 5]","Wow, So Malcolm in the Middle is going through what...?  It's fourth season I believe....  If you like The Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, King of the Hill.......then you will probably also like MitM.  I myself love the show.  I am a huge, huge Simpsons fan and I thought that no other show could ever compete with it.....then Malcolm showed up.  It's a hilarious show about a boy Malcolm, who is a genius, who lives with his sort of crazed/original/wacky family.  He has an older brother, and a younger brother and the three of them always get into HUGE trouble doing REALLY stupid/bad, but funny things.  When their mother always finds out about the stuff her boys did, she goes almost insane.  Their dad is a cool guy who sort of just lets things fly by.  He is sort of the nice one of the parents, but he does some wacky stuff too and basically everybody in the family.  Malcolm also has a brother who was really crazed when living at home so Hal/Louis put him into a military school.  At the military school, he gets into a bunch of trouble with the head/dean guy.  About halfway through the 4 seasons, Francis, (military school guy) ended up going to Alaska with his friends and worked for a really really mean lady a restaraunt who basically tortured...metaphorically.  Then he ended up finding his way to working on a ranch for this really weird foreign guy who pays him lots of money and gives him a car.  That foreign boss guy is really weird and funny in his own way.  Of course things happen at high school with Malcolm and Reese and their friends and girlfriends.  So you have a show that can be totally different each time, but every show is extremely funny.  You can have a show that takes place everywhere, mainly at the military academy, mainly at Alaska, mainly at the ranch, mainly at home, or anywhere that they go!  For instance:  In one show they end up getting stuck on a road in the middle of nowhere because there is a crash or something so the boys meet up with a girl in the desert terrain, one show they go to a water park, and in one show they go to a family renunion.  The show is just flat out a 10/10 star show and it definately competes with the simpsons.  I just wish that they would get season 2 out on dvd soon so that I can have all of the shows to watch again before seeing later shows.  The price is great too at many sites.  You get about 18 episodes and the extra features are pretty cool.

Epsodic TV used to be at least somewhat practical, until hyperactive programmers started switching around the schedule like bush babbies on amphetimines.  Even before that there occurred incessently the ring of the phone, the pangs of hunger, the call of nature.  DVDs changed all of that.Series' box sets are the most user-friendly way to watch the series you like.  This is no exception.  I managed with great effort to watch the 1st series when it was being broadcast, but after that it all went to Heck.Then along came DVDs.Now.  The packaging.  This set isn't the first with this problem and it sure won't be the last.  I acquired 2 problem sets this week alone.  Those clear trays sure do look classy, don't they?  They work fine if the hubs have a large enough diameter that they hold the discs securely.  Fortunately, my Malcom gripped the hubs so tightly that I nearly broke disc 1 extracting it from its tray.  This is clearly the lesser of the two evils.In several other recent cases, the hubs were so small that when I turned them upside down, the discs fell right off.  When this happens inside a closed box, during transit, the discs jiggle around something awful.With the clear trays, harder and potentially sharper, the discs can look like someone took a brillo pad to them.  Certain players are more tolerant of scratches than others.  This trait is usually covered in Consumer Reports reviews of players.  The current issue, for instance, mentions especially notable examples at either extreme.My player is not listed.  It has to be very damage tolerant, though, because out of over 700 DVDs, the only ones with playing problems have had - you guessed it:  clear plastic trays and narrow hubs.Pretty but impractcal.Check your discs.  Especially the boxed sets, where some retailers may look askance at a return after 2 months when you finally get to that disc 6 with all the scratches on it.Ah.  The material.  I am not too big on U.S. sitcoms.  Britcoms are another matter.  (Thank goodness for Amazon.uk and region-free players.)  I managed to actually plant myself in front of the TV at the appropriate times at the start of the first season of Malcolm and I remember enjoying it.  After that the comittment was too much and I drifted away.  After purchasing this set on a whim, while sitting through most of it, I laughed harder than I have laughed at a sitcom for a long time.This is good stuff.  The Right Stuff.

Recently I bought this set, and season one has got to be one of the funniest seasons of this show. This show is so good because it relates to real life.

I'll admit it--the family on this television program represents mine at the most intimate level. One exception is that whatever humor we find in situations that occur in ours is usually in hindsight. Luckily we can laugh at this family the first time around.The DVD is of exceptional quality. The full screen presentation does suffer from grain problems on occasion but, on the whole, the transfers are very good. The commentary, outtakes and gag reel are worth the price alone. While the show has continued to evolve and is still as funny as the first season (and, yes, I believe this is the best written sitcom bar none--it's also better written and funnier at a gutbusting level than the Simpsons. Don't get me wrong, I admire The Simpsons but it's strayed away from the very qualities that made it special and funny a long, long time ago).Frankie Muniz is perfectly cast as Malcolm but, more importantly, the actors portraying this family are equally as loopy and fun to observe. I really haven't found a weak link in the first season casting. The pilot deservingly won Emmys for best direction and writing. The extended version adds a bit of additional fun that wasn't on the final aired version. Additionally, there are bits added to a couple of episodes that were deleted for time constraints and other reasons when the original episodes aired in 2000. It's amazing that such a quality show could ever have been seen as nothing more than a mid-season replacement.While the box set is a bit light on episodes (there wasn't a full season produced during season one as it was a replacement series) the extras more than make up for that. Additionally, the commentary adds quite a bit to a couple of episodes and make the discs worth viewing again just to find out the odd little tidbits mentioned.While Season Two would continue to build on the success of the first season, it wasn't until Season three that there was additional comic depth added to the program.",5,Outstanding first season for the &quot;true&quot; American family,1051315200,"04 26, 2003",2003,2096,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'Simpsons', 'did', ""n't"", 'represent', 'goofyness', 'heart', 'American', 'family', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'family', 'television', 'program', 'mine', 'most', 'intimate', 'level', 'One', 'exception', 'humor', 'find', 'situations', 'occur', 'ours', 'usually', 'hindsight', 'can', 'laugh', 'family', 'first', 'time', 'around.The', 'DVD', 'exceptional', 'quality', 'full', 'screen', 'presentation', 'suffer', 'grain', 'problems', 'occasion', 'whole', 'transfers', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'commentary', 'outtakes', 'gag', 'reel', 'are', 'price', 'alone', 'show', 'continued', 'evolve', 'still', 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'season', 'yes', 'believe', 'best', 'written', 'sitcom', 'bar', 'none', 'also', 'better', 'written', 'funnier', 'gutbusting', 'level', 'Simpsons', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'admire', 'Simpsons', 'strayed', 'away', 'very', 'made', 'special', 'funny', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'ago', '.Frankie', 'Muniz', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Malcolm', 'more', 'importantly', 'actors', 'portraying', 'family', 'are', 'equally', 'loopy', 'fun', 'observe', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'weak', 'link', 'first', 'season', 'casting', 'pilot', 'deservingly', 'won', 'Emmys', 'best', 'direction', 'writing', 'extended', 'version', 'bit', 'additional', 'fun', 'was', ""n't"", 'final', 'aired', 'version', 'Additionally', 'are', 'bits', 'added', 'couple', 'episodes', 'were', 'deleted', 'time', 'constraints', 'other', 'reasons', 'when', 'original', 'episodes', 'aired', '2000', 'amazing', 'quality', 'show', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'nothing', 'more', 'mid-season', 'replacement.While', 'box', 'set', 'bit', 'light', 'episodes', 'was', ""n't"", 'full', 'season', 'produced', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'replacement', 'series', 'extras', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'Additionally', 'commentary', 'quite', 'bit', 'couple', 'episodes', 'make', 'discs', 'viewing', 'again', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'odd', 'little', 'tidbits', 'Season', 'Two', 'would', 'continue', 'build', 'success', 'first', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'Season', 'three', 'was', 'additional', 'comic', 'depth', 'added', 'program']",Malcolm in the Middle: Season 1
