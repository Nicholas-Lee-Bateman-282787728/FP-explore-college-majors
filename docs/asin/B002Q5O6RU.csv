The Black Crowes really came back strong with the ""Before The Frost/Until The Freeze"" album. The sound quality is top notch, and the musicianship displayed by all band members is totally pro! I had the opportunity to see the Crowes in concert last month, and I was absolutely floored by the intensity, tightness and musicianship of this band--they've never sounded better! Luther Dickinson (who already was a major figure on the jam band scene with the North Mississippi Allstars before joining the Crowes) fits perfectly into this band, and is featured prominently throughout. The backstage and behind-the-scenes footage is also enjoyable.A great DVD to buy in celebrating 20 years of great music from the Black Crowes--highly recommended!",5,A documentary/concert recording of great music!,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,793,"['Great', 'music', 'great', 'band', 'captured', 'film', 'Black', 'Crowes', 'really', 'came', 'back', 'strong', 'Frost/Until', 'Freeze', 'album', 'sound', 'quality', 'top', 'notch', 'musicianship', 'displayed', 'band', 'members', 'totally', 'pro', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Crowes', 'concert', 'last', 'month', 'was', 'absolutely', 'floored', 'intensity', 'tightness', 'musicianship', 'band', ""'ve"", 'never', 'sounded', 'better', 'Luther', 'Dickinson', 'who', 'already', 'was', 'major', 'figure', 'jam', 'band', 'scene', 'North', 'Mississippi', 'Allstars', 'joining', 'Crowes', 'perfectly', 'band', 'featured', 'prominently', 'backstage', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'also', 'enjoyable.A', 'great', 'DVD', 'buy', 'celebrating', '20', 'years', 'great', 'music', 'Black', 'Crowes', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1283490,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B002Q5O6RU,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[15, 15]","This is a very innovative dvd. It shows the Black Crowes performing, and ""recording"" in a large 2 story cabin, before a live, ""packed"", enthusiastic audience, in an informal setting. This shows the ""actual recording"" of songs for the album ""Before the Frost...Until The Freeze"". There are a few songs that were recorded & filmed in the cabin, without a live audience, but most of the songs were recorded before the live audience. Also, you get some documentary elements mixed in. However, everything was filmed in a very informal setting. You get to see the actual ""making"" of an album.This is not one of those gentle, ""intimate"" acoustic performances. Here you get the real thing, electric guitars, keyboards, drums, a banjo, a fiddle, a petal steel guitar, and maybe even more.A lot of the ""stuff"" on this dvd, was edited out of the album cd ""Before the Frost"", but everything on the album cd ""Before the Frost"" actually came from recordings seen on this dvd.So, the Crowes ""experiment"" was successful, you get a great dvd, plus a recorded album. The camera angles are great. This was ""experimental"", but it was well planned, well filmed, well mixed, well performed, thus resulting in a great innovative result. I applaud the Black Crowes for their innovation & pioneering effort.Chris has excellent interaction with the crowd. The songs are all great. Plus you even get 2 bonus songs. You also get commentaries by each of the band members. The first song has Rich sitting on the floor, playing a sitar, which is a large Indian (as in the country of India) guitar. I've never seen anything quite like it, but he does an excellent job. I was very impressed with Luther Dickinson's slide guitar play. Chris is an excellent lead man, spokesman, comedian & lead singer. Rich and the rest of the band are all impressive also. This is a ""must-have"" for any Black Crowes fan period.

Until the Freeze when It came out and love it more now watching the dvd of them cutting the record. You get to see the band working through the tunes and little pieces of the brothers working up the tunes alone. Just an amazing insight to the process behind the album. The Crowes are one of those rare bands who strive to go somewhere they have never been on each record, that always makes you wish you were a fly on the wall while they were creating them. Now you are. Very few bands are this gracious to their fans, creating these unique moments and sharing the journey with fans. They will and always will be one of the truly great bands in music.

The Crowes here touch on Skynyrd , the Stones and now Creedence Clearwater and some ole mountain music. Which i am especially fond of. Their version of ""Oh Sweet Nuthin'""is very moving and the guitar interplay between Luther & Rich Robinson is incredible. The band has found their way now and are a solid unit.

It exceeded all of my expectations.  Reminiscent of some of my favorite live recordings like ""The Last Waltz"" and The Beatles roof top ""Let It Be"" album this is a great production.  Top notch musicianship by all, the music runs the gamut from blues, to rock, to bluegrass, to an acoustic twosome by the Robinson brothers.  It is true blue American music all the way.  Recorded at Levon Helm's house/studio it was an intimate affair with a small audience of maybe a couple of hundred people.  The band recorded all the songs for the CD live and the DVD allows us to see those very recordings.  I've watched this DVD a dozen times now and it just gets better with every viewing.  The specs say this DVD runs two hours but it sure never feels like it.  If I could give this DVD a hundred stars I would.
