Something is a bit wrong with the system when Season 1 in the States in season 2 in Australia?? My son who was eagerly awaiting his new Ninjago DVD was very disappointed to find out it was the same as the one he already had.Is there a whole season of the Boneheads (skeleton characters) or just the one 45min episode with the Boneheads and Lord Garmodon??,1,Disappointed,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,520,"['thought', 'was', 'buying', 'different', 'season', 'one', 'bought', 'shops', 'Australia', 'was', 'marked', 'Season', '2', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'exact', 'same', 'story', 'Something', 'bit', 'wrong', 'system', 'when', 'Season', '1', 'States', 'season', '2', 'Australia', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'new', 'Ninjago', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'same', 'one', 'already', 'had.Is', 'whole', 'season', 'Boneheads', 'skeleton', 'characters', 'just', 'one', '45min', 'episode', 'Boneheads', 'Lord', 'Garmodon']",N/A

1539919,A1NQAYUMIAT0H0,B007Z8ECHC,AMT,"[5, 7]","I have a 5 and 7 year old who love this show! As a mother of two young boys, I am frequently stuck watching bad children's TV shows, like the Power Rangers.  If anyone is familiar with the Power Ranger Series, it is poorly acted and the story line is simplistic and boring for anyone over the age of 9??  So, when you run into a children's show that is fun to watch as an adult, it is a bonus!  So I like this DVD for a couple of reasons, the animation is very good, the  story line is funny and entertaining AND I get a break from the Power Rangers!!  :)  As a parent, it becomes more and more difficult to find family friendly and age appropriate shows for young kids.
