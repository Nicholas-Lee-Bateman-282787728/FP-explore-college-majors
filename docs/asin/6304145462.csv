404032,AIMR915K4YCN,6304145462,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[5, 6]","Poor Jim Norman (Tim ""Animal House"" Matheson), he's just moved back to his hometown after a disastrous end to his teaching career in Chicago. In his new school, the principal hates him and his students are mostly hateful jocks. To make matters worse, Jim's memories of growing up in this town are dominated by the day his brother was killed 27 years earlier by four greasers in a black car. Jim wakes up nightly, deeply disturbed by realistic nightmares of the event. Soon, three of the kids in his class are murdered and replaced by the ghosts of three of the killers from Jim's past! You see, Jim's brother wasn't the only one who died that day. The punks who killed him were hit by a train! Now, Jim must face his past and deal with his fear in order to save himself and his family from certain death. Matheson is very good as Jim. His wife is played by Brooke Adams (Shock Waves, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers). The ghostly-greasers are certainly worthy of special mention, as they are truly menacing and funny in an evil sort of way. They seem like the kind of guys you might run into in some lonely alley. Guys who laugh and joke around while robbing and killing you! Just imagine these crazy types as seemingly indestructible undead who are after you and your loved ones!

404036,A2XILEETU7VV7L,6304145462,Dawn,"[14, 17]","This is a great movie that is based on a rather strange short story by the master himself, Stephen King. The original short story was very short and  had a &quot;strange&quot; ending. This movie, i my opinion is better than  the story by far. The original short story I think is only 20 or 30  something pages and lacks alot of characterization. This movie fills in the  giant hole that is in the short story. And believe it or not, this  made-for-tv movie has great acting. The boys who play the hoods are pretty  convincing--especially Richard Lawson.  The story is about a teacher  named Jim Norman who moves to a new town in whicch his brother was killed  by a group of hoods in about thirty years earlier. He keeps having dreams  about them that are haunting him. One day on of his students ends up  missing and one of the dead hoods from the 50's is seating in his seat--for  every person they kill another one comes back. Student after student keeps  being killed and another after another hood returns to class for revenge.  Th only way that they can be stopped is if they have a final confrontation  with Jim back in the tunnel that claimed the lives of his brother and the  hoods. The results are awesome.  On another note the DVD isnt very good.  The transfer doesnt seem to do the justice. The picture messes up every  once and a while and sometimes i noticed that the words seem to not match  their mouth!  The sound is awesome though.

404041,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6304145462,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","This film is a piece of art, a masterpiece too. It brings together, in a very frightening and disquieting way, many of Stephen King's themes. First two brothers, in the past, one being killed by four bullies. Second, the dead brother is coming back from beyond to help his little, now older, brother solve the problem. Third, the problem is the return of three of the bullies who were killed by a train in their car under a tunnel because the surviving brother had stolen away the key of the car they had dropped, blocking them thus in front of the train. Four, the three bullies are systematically killing the students of the surviving brother, now a teacher who came back to his native city, five, one after another because they have any normal contact with him. Five, they make the deaths look strange so that the teacher will be suspected. Six, he knows about them, either because he sees the crimes in real life, but he is the only one to see them, or because he is haunted in his dreams with a vision that tells him every detail. Seven, this will go on till he accepts a final confrontation in the very same place where the first confrontation occurred in the past. Eight, they will be destroyed by a replay of the train scene, etc. This film is very disquieting because it means no one must ever come back to a place they have fled because of a dramatic event. Or if one ever comes back to such a place, one will have to confront the past and solve it by solving the problem that happened in this past. This theme is common in Stephen King's novels, like, for example,  Dolores Claiborne  or  IT . The theme of the living deads has been used over and over again, and the great value of Stephen King's imagination is that he introduces so many variations that we, at times, do not even recognize the theme, like in  The Dark Half , for instance.

I remember the car playing an effective supporting role to ""the boys from hell"", and I remember the look on those boys faces as frightning -and their behaviour as a good match to this bad-boy-style.This movie being all in all a typicall work from the supposely horrormaster, Stephen King himself. Before I go on with ""Sometimes They Come Back"" I have to add that to my disappointment Stephen King is no longer on top of this genre. One; Probably because I'm older now -but also Two; Many of his book-adaptions (including his own, and not only for their time of production) are so amateurish and of the made-for-television-kind that I don't find him as ""convinsing"" anymore. The book behind ""Pet Semetary"", well, it still gives me the creeps -a masterpiece in the horror-genre, done with style and intellect, and the name ""Zelda"" sure brings back some unpleasant memories from that book (It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I remember it as rather creepy too). My point is; I remembered ""Sometimes They Come Back"" as one of the better adaptions, but times really have changed -to my big disappointment... This movie is average, nothing special to it at all. I had in mind, of course, that it could turn out be a little different than how I remembered it, but the B-movie-feel and the bad picture-quality and sound, and cheap effects not to mention, and the amateurish filming -yes, at first I thought I was looking at a movie from the middle of the 80's, and man was I surprised to read that this movie was produced for tv already back in 91. The quality sure makes it seem older than that, and as you can imagine it didn't exactly help it either.On the plus side; The acting is good, the lead character (The teacher) and the bad boys are fit for their parts, and saves the movie this way from being a total disaster. Their laughter (the bad boys') indeed still sounds as wicked as I recalled it (another plus I guess) reminding me of hyenas.

404057,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,6304145462,William,"[18, 19]","'Sometimes they Come Back' was a 1991 film based on a short story by Stephen King. It was filmed for TV and is a personal favourite. It is about a school teacher (Tim Matheson) who returns to his hometown to teach at a school. He has reservations about doing this because of a tragedy which occurred many years before. The movie has a real feel of eeriness about it, and while far fetched at times, is credible because of the way a person's mind can be affected by unresolved past issues. Definitely worth a viewing.DVD BACKGROUND: This was first released on DVD in 2001 by a smaller DVD company. As a result the transfer was far from superior and looked like a straight video to DVD transfer. It was 1:33 full frame too.  Initially I thought 1:33 was the correct framing since it had been filmed for TV back in 1991.  In late 2007, MGM released the film on DVD. While Amazon list the technical details as 1:33, it is actually 2:35 widescreen anamorphic. Seeing the film like this has brought a whole new dimension to a great film. According to a website I looked at the other day, this film was indeed filmed in widescreen. Even more exciting is the new DVD image is a vast improvment on the earlier DVD.  Beautifully cleaned up and all.OVERALL THOUGHTS:  A great adaptation of a short Stephen King story which has been re-released on DVD respectfully. A stellar image presented in its correct aspect ratio.  If you have only ever seen this film in the cropped video version or cropped early DVD version, do yourself a favour and purchase the new MGM release and experience the film in glorious widescreen.",5,New DVD transfer,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,1607,"[""'Sometimes"", 'Come', 'Back', 'was', '1991', 'film', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'was', 'filmed', 'TV', 'personal', 'favourite', 'school', 'teacher', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'who', 'hometown', 'teach', 'school', 'reservations', 'doing', 'tragedy', 'occurred', 'many', 'years', 'movie', 'real', 'feel', 'eeriness', 'far', 'fetched', 'times', 'credible', 'way', 'person', 'mind', 'can', 'be', 'affected', 'unresolved', 'past', 'issues', 'Definitely', 'viewing.DVD', 'BACKGROUND', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'DVD', '2001', 'smaller', 'DVD', 'company', 'result', 'transfer', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'looked', 'straight', 'video', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', '1:33', 'full', 'frame', 'too', 'Initially', 'thought', '1:33', 'was', 'correct', 'framing', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'TV', 'back', '1991', 'late', '2007', 'MGM', 'released', 'film', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'list', 'technical', 'details', '1:33', 'actually', '2:35', 'widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'Seeing', 'film', 'brought', 'whole', 'new', 'dimension', 'great', 'film', 'According', 'website', 'looked', 'other', 'day', 'film', 'was', 'indeed', 'filmed', 'widescreen', 'Even', 'more', 'exciting', 'new', 'DVD', 'image', 'vast', 'improvment', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'Beautifully', 'cleaned', 'up', 'all.OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'great', 'adaptation', 'short', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'been', 're-released', 'DVD', 'respectfully', 'stellar', 'image', 'presented', 'correct', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'have', 'only', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'cropped', 'video', 'version', 'cropped', 'early', 'DVD', 'version', 'do', 'favour', 'purchase', 'new', 'MGM', 'release', 'experience', 'film', 'glorious', 'widescreen']",Sometimes They Come Back VHS
