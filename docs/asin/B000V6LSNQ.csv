1099011,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B000V6LSNQ,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[1, 2]","If ""Munsters"" fans can accept the fact that this TV movie does not feature the classic cast of Fred Gwynne, Yvonne DeCarlo and Al Lewis, they might be entertained.  Sam McMurray has the impossible task of following Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster. Gwynne  is and always will be the definitive Herman. That said, McMurray does an excellent job, as does Ann Magnuson as Lily. The only major disappointment is Sandy Baron as Grandpa. Baron is much too low-key and Grandpa, therefore, is nowhere near the wild, wacky, and wonderful character immortalized by the incomparable Al Lewis. The movie manages to be fun, nevertheless. The Munsters, America's favorite family of fright, try to cheer up a seriously depressed Eddie  (Bug Hall) who, feeling like an outcast from society again, longs for an ""old-fashioned Trasylvanian Christmas.""Santa Claus is trapped in Grandpa's labaratory and is accidentally transformed into a Christmas fruitcake! The ""Santa fruitcake"" is almost eaten as dessert by a shrill neighbor lady, who seems to be a direct descendant of the Gladys Kravitz character from ""Bewitched."" It's too bad that Santa's elves, Lefty and Larry, are mean-spirited and all too eager to cancel Christmas. Lefty even refers to Santa as a ""tub of lard."" The Munsters, of course, manage to make Santa human again and save Christmas.  Black- sheep Marilyn (an especially fetching Elaine Hendrix) even gets a handome boyfriend for Christmas.The DVD also comes packaged with a Bonus CD of Christmas carols, performed by an anonymous, bland male singer. My advice: Enjoy the DVD movie but throw the CD away.",3,"NOT THE ORIGINAL ""MUNSTERS"" CAST, BUT FUN",1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,1601,"['Munsters', 'fans', 'can', 'accept', 'fact', 'TV', 'movie', 'not', 'feature', 'classic', 'cast', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Yvonne', 'DeCarlo', 'Al', 'Lewis', 'might', 'be', 'entertained', 'Sam', 'McMurray', 'impossible', 'task', 'following', 'Fred', 'Gwynne', 'Herman', 'Munster', 'Gwynne', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'definitive', 'Herman', 'said', 'McMurray', 'excellent', 'job', 'Ann', 'Magnuson', 'Lily', 'only', 'major', 'disappointment', 'Sandy', 'Baron', 'Grandpa', 'Baron', 'much', 'too', 'low-key', 'Grandpa', 'therefore', 'nowhere', 'wild', 'wacky', 'wonderful', 'character', 'immortalized', 'incomparable', 'Al', 'Lewis', 'movie', 'be', 'fun', 'nevertheless', 'Munsters', 'America', 'favorite', 'family', 'fright', 'try', 'cheer', 'up', 'seriously', 'depressed', 'Eddie', 'Bug', 'Hall', 'who', 'feeling', 'outcast', 'society', 'again', 'longs', 'old-fashioned', 'Trasylvanian', 'Christmas', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'trapped', 'Grandpa', 'labaratory', 'accidentally', 'transformed', 'Christmas', 'fruitcake', 'Santa', 'fruitcake', 'almost', 'eaten', 'dessert', 'shrill', 'neighbor', 'lady', 'who', 'be', 'direct', 'descendant', 'Gladys', 'Kravitz', 'character', 'Bewitched', 'too', 'bad', 'Santa', 'elves', 'Lefty', 'Larry', 'are', 'mean-spirited', 'too', 'eager', 'cancel', 'Christmas', 'Lefty', 'even', 'Santa', 'tub', 'lard', 'Munsters', 'course', 'manage', 'make', 'Santa', 'human', 'again', 'save', 'Christmas', 'Black-', 'sheep', 'Marilyn', 'especially', 'fetching', 'Elaine', 'Hendrix', 'even', 'handome', 'boyfriend', 'Christmas.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'packaged', 'Bonus', 'CD', 'Christmas', 'carols', 'performed', 'anonymous', 'bland', 'male', 'singer', 'advice', 'Enjoy', 'DVD', 'movie', 'throw', 'CD', 'away']",The Munsters' Scary Little Christmas
1099012,A2Z65D8FBYDY63,B000V6LSNQ,Donald J. Wurzelbacher,"[0, 0]","This is a cute little Christmas movie that does have some funny lines. The writers did try very hard to bring back the humor of the original series. Sam McMurray does a very good job imitating the late great Fred Gwynne as Herman. Ann Magnuson is a very good Lily Munster as well. Bug Hall seems a little too old to be Eddie but still he is a fine choice overall. My two disagreeeable cast choices are Sandy Baron as Grampa and Elaine Hendrix as Marilyn. Baron just does not have the looks or charm of Al Lewis. Although nobody can take Lewis's place, it's too much like watching grampa's relative rather than grampa himself. As far as Elaine Hendrix, I always thought she looks too much like a villain than the girl-next-door.The story was actually written better than most of these TV movies based on old TV shows. The writers really do seem to create a 'labor of love' and truly were Munsters fans. The only real problem I personally had were the 'evil elves' of Santa even though they changed their tunes at the end.All in all, if you are a Munsters fan you should enjoy this little film every year. It's the closest you can get to a Christmas episode of the original series.

The jokes and plot resemble the old TV show, which is a good thing. The only cast member that doesn't really seem right for the part is Sandy Baron is Grandpa. He doesn't seem endearing and is stiff in the role. If they were to recast Grandpa and take out the few ""off-color"" jokes, this would be an above-par movie. As it turned out, the movie is still recommended and should be recognized for staying true to the original Munsters for the most part. None of the Munsters re-makes have equaled the original 1960s TV series, but it seems that there is a fondness for the original show in this movie.
