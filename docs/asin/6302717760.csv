329082,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6302717760,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[48, 49]","The first all-African American feature film ever made, ""Hallelujah!"" was also King Vidor's first ""talkie,"" and one that he was willing to forfeit his salary for in order to make.Those who might be troubled by ""racial stereotypes"" are failing to see the exquisite beauty of this film, and its place in cultural history; it is an astounding film for all Americans, especially those of African descent, to watch and be proud of.A melodramatic morality tale, it is about a naive cotton farmer who falls into the net of a pretty but corrupt girl, and his rocky road from sin to redemption.It also shows the hardship of the life of a sharecropper; the wrenching poverty and backbreaking labor, as well as the faith to survive it all.Daniel L. Haynes is extraordinary as Zeke. Had he been born 50 years later, he would no doubt have been a major world superstar. Incredibly handsome and charismatic, he was also blessed with a marvelous voice, and great acting ability. Thank goodness this film exists, as a remembrance of his enormous talent.The other members of the cast are also excellent, with Nina Mae McKinney as the seductive Chick and Fanny Belle DeKnight, as Mammy Johnson, Zeke's mother who never gives up hope for her wayward son. The scene where Mammy holds the children in her arms and sings a lullaby is one that moves me to tears; this is a film that expresses much love, and the best of human characteristics.The music is glorious, combining spirituals like ""Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child"" with songs like Irving Berlin's ""Waiting at the End of the Road,"" and there are also some superb dance numbers. I was particularly delighted by the short but well executed sand soft shoe in the bar scene, a style that started in the early 1910s during the minstrel shows. Tap dancing has its roots in slavery, and the history of this unique American art form is fascinating; anyone interested in the evolution of American dance will love this film.The b&w; cinematography by Gordon Avil is crisp and uses stark contrasts, and for the most part, there is little evidence of its age. Coming from the same era, and with similar themes of good and evil, this film shares a kinship with the DuBose Heyward and Gershwin versions of ""Porgy and Bess.""

329084,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,6302717760,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[5, 6]","This was the second talking feature featuring Black Americans (""Hearts in Dixie"" w/Stepin Fetchit seems to be MIA). But it's very good. Oh sure, the story's a tad hackneyed (Country boy goes to the big city and is bamboozeld by city gal), but the execution of it all makes it worthwhile. Daniel Hayes is good as the country boy (wait til you see the ""train sermon"") and Nina Mae McKinney makes me proud to be a South Carolinian. You'll really enjoy the climactic scene, which is remarkable considering the primitive state of sound films in those days.As for the extras-""Pie Pie Blackbird"" is an amusing, albeit plotless number from 1932 involving Sister Nina and the very young Nicholas Brothers singing and dancing. The finale with the Eubie Blake band in the huge pie has to be seen to be believed.""The Black Network"" was ghostwritten by Octavus Roy Cohen, a popular white writer of the 1920s (in)famous for his comical(?) short fiction about Black life. This film , however is a lot better than his grossly stereotyped books that would rank down on the level of ""Soul Plane"" and much of what appears on UPN today. This is the tale of a jealous wife of a radio producer who refuses to let Nina and her beau appear on a radio show. The very young Nicholas Bros jazz things up again with a song called ""Lucky Numbers."" The ending is a real hoot. The producers' wife, BTW, is played to comic perfection by Amanda Randoplh, who played Mama in the Amos and Andy Comedies.",5,Well done!,1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,1468,"['was', 'second', 'talking', 'feature', 'featuring', 'Black', 'Americans', 'Hearts', 'Dixie', 'w/Stepin', 'Fetchit', 'be', 'MIA', 'very', 'good', 'Oh', 'sure', 'story', 'tad', 'hackneyed', 'Country', 'big', 'city', 'bamboozeld', 'city', 'gal', 'execution', 'worthwhile', 'Daniel', 'Hayes', 'good', 'country', 'boy', 'wait', 'til', 'see', 'train', 'sermon', 'Nina', 'Mae', 'McKinney', 'proud', 'be', 'South', 'Carolinian', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'climactic', 'scene', 'remarkable', 'considering', 'primitive', 'state', 'sound', 'films', 'days.As', 'extras-', 'Pie', 'Pie', 'Blackbird', 'amusing', 'plotless', 'number', '1932', 'involving', 'Sister', 'Nina', 'very', 'young', 'Nicholas', 'Brothers', 'singing', 'dancing', 'finale', 'Eubie', 'Blake', 'band', 'huge', 'pie', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'Black', 'Network', 'was', 'ghostwritten', 'Octavus', 'Roy', 'Cohen', 'popular', 'white', 'writer', '1920s', 'famous', 'comical', 'short', 'fiction', 'Black', 'life', 'film', 'however', 'lot', 'better', 'grossly', 'stereotyped', 'books', 'would', 'rank', 'down', 'level', 'Soul', 'Plane', 'much', 'what', 'UPN', 'today', 'tale', 'jealous', 'wife', 'radio', 'producer', 'who', 'let', 'Nina', 'beau', 'appear', 'radio', 'show', 'very', 'young', 'Nicholas', 'Bros', 'jazz', 'things', 'up', 'again', 'song', 'called', 'Lucky', 'Numbers', 'ending', 'real', 'hoot', 'producers', 'wife', 'BTW', 'played', 'comic', 'perfection', 'Amanda', 'Randoplh', 'who', 'played', 'Mama', 'Amos', 'Andy', 'Comedies']",N/A
329085,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302717760,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","Before the main feature we have two musical shorts that include the stage tapping Nicholas Brothers. Little Harold, a remarkably energetic dancer, would later perform a fine rendition of ""Across the Sea"" in the opening Las Vegas segment ofFUNNY BONES(1995). He's here with older brother Fayard; both look dapper. (As we learn from the PBS special entitledVAUDEVILLE, the brothers always refused to dress in rags or do anything that denigrated African-Americans. This steadfastness limited their movie career.)The first short, PIE, PIE BLACKBIRD (1932) has Eubie Blake and a small jazz band playing from inside an open pie crust! The Nicholases dance, but they don't get near those blackbirds in their pie.The second two-reeler is equally egregious.THE BLACK NETWORK (1934) is about a radio show sponsored by ""Pullman Porter Shoe Polish."" A rather homely comedienne named Amanda Randolph sings badly on this live broadcast while her movie husband, 'Basement' Brown grimaces behind her back and makes ""get outta here with that"" motions. The Washboard Serenaders are enjoyable; Harold and Fayard sing and dance in their sharply-tailored matching suits. It's solid entertainment despite stereotypes.HALLELUJAH! (1929) is preceded by a lengthy disclaimer from WARNER's that decries the film's stereotypes: ""It was wrong then and it's wrong now.""After duly-noted warnings, what we see is how life was for Southern sharecroppers, who still existed much as their Antebellum ancestors had: laboring long hours in cotton fields, living in dirt floor shacks and sharing a fervent, demonstrative faith. Arkansas pickaninny dialect is the only regrettable element in King Vidor's presentation of what was at that time a way of life for many.A subsequent story of the floozie who, along with a loaded-dice carrying ally, cheat an unsophisticated farmer out of his hard-earned hundred dollars also rings true. A skirmish between this fleeced man and the cheater results in the accidental shooting of the victim's kid brother. Back home, our grief-stricken farmer wails a song of pain to the Lord. Other mourners encourage him to become a minister, which he does.HALLELUJAH! is a beautifully-rendered motion picture of great power, easily the best of the first generation of talkies. Transfer quality from a well-preserved print is excellent.

Absent from most lists of 100 best films I've seen, I hardly knew it existed. The American social drama was exposed by Vidor as nobody else could (comparable only to Ford's 'The Grapes of Wrath' and few others). Lots of things happen here, but it's not to be told, it's to be watched and felt personally. But to me the theme is very spiritual: How real sin is. How some people will blind themselves to its evil nature (""For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God."" 1 Cor. 1:18), like the drunk who denies his alcoholism; and how others will struggle and stumble but eventually -God willing- they will repent and be saved.People may say this film is about social conditions, poverty, injustice, religious fanaticism, racism, whatever. But it's about none of those (because all those don't matter). This is about choice.It's also the story of the prodigal son, retold, the Black American way. A biblical story that is always true, no matter when or where it happened. And as all biblical stories it's there for us to learn from them. And we'll have learned when we have acted upon it.

329087,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6302717760,calvinnme,"[6, 7]","This early talkie was advertised as being a musical even though it is actually a drama with some very good musical numbers included. The movie was set and filmed in Memphis with an all black cast and directed by King Vidor. In fact, this is King Vidor's first talking picture. By today's standards, it overflows with stereotypes. Yet, as Warner says in its disclaimer, these images should be kept alive rather than hidden away so that we may learn from them. By the standards of 1929, Vidor was actually sympathetic in his treatment of the characters considering the times. If you want to see really horrific jaw-dropping stereotypes, go watch the best picture of 1930-1, ""Cimarron"". It is not at all atypical of what went on in motion pictures in those days in how African Americans were portrayed. Apparently King Vidor was quite insistent on not giving in to these commonly accepted stereotypes as much as was possible in the late 1920's, since he even agreed to direct the film for free in order to tell the story he wanted to tell the way he wanted to tell it. This film is actually not about race at all. Instead Vidor intended it to be a look into rural African American culture as he observed it growing up in the South himself set within the context of a morality play.The plot is this - A family of sharecroppers, the Johnsons, have just finished harvesting the year's cotton crop. Being the oldest son, Zeke (Daniel L. Haynes) is responsible for selling the crop at market. Younger brother Spunk (Everett McGarrity) tags along. Zeke does as he is instructed, and gets good money in return for the family's cotton. However, things go wrong when Zeke is tempted by beautiful grifter Chick (Nina Mae McKinney) before he can return home with the cash. She and her partner ""Hot Shot"" procede to cheat Zeke out of his money. Zeke reacts violently when he discovers that he has been had both romantically - hurting his pride, and financially - hurting his entire family. Violence begets violence, and a tragedy ensues that brings about Zeke's religious conversion. He becomes a preacher, and takes up with a girl that is on the straight and narrow, much to the approval of his parents, his own father being a preacher himself. However, Chick soon returns to Zeke's life, at first mocking his conversion, then experiencing conversion herself while listening to Zeke preach. However, it seems Chick is just born to be bad. She tempts Zeke away from his devout girlfriend and his preaching, and eventually leads him to tragedy once again. After Zeke finishes his prison sentence for the violence he has wrought, he is seen being welcomed back into the loving arms of his family - a prodigal son returning.Although the movie does give us a rare glimpse into Black culture in the south during the early twentieth century, the story being told transcends race and time. It has much to say about how men and women of the cloth are only human and religious conversion often has only a temporary effect on changing a person's behavior when it comes to the temptations of everyday life. Extras include commentary by black cultural scholars Donald Bogle and Avery Clayton and there are two musical numbers sung by Nina Mae McKinney. One is ""Pie, Pie Blackbird"" and the other is ""The Black Network"". These two musical numbers have nothing to do with the film. The only connection to ""Hallelujah"" is that the featured performer just happens to be one of the leads in this movie.

329089,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6302717760,David Baldwin,"[16, 17]","Warner Brothers prior to the film issues a disclaimer apologizing for racial stereotypes depicted in ""Hallelujah"" that could be potentially offensive to modern audiences.  I cannot pretend to speak for the African-American community but I cannot imagine anybody being offended by King Vidor's film which affirms the sanctity of faith, fidelity, and family.  The film follows the personal odyssey of Zeke (Daniel L. Haynes) a decent cotton farmer who tries to lead a good life but is waylaid at various junctures by the temptress, Chick(Nina Mae McKinney) with tragic consequences.  Zeke succeeds at one point in the religious ministry only to have Chick scuttle that endeavor.  Credit Vidor for recognizing that his characters are essentially good people with flaws that are inherent to everybody.  Haynes does a superlative job portraying a man whose moral and religious fibre is constantly being tested.  The real revelation here is McKinney, though.

The second film of a quadrilogy that intended to reflect the great 1929 depression that was to throw the US into the arms of history, of reformism and social progress that will have to go through WW2 to finally come to a real leap forward that has never been finished nevertheless. The film shows first of all how much the US owed to the Blacks they had imported as enslaved cattle and that were starting to conquer a human position in a deeply unjust society, through the cultural development they brought and invested in US music. The musical side of the film is fascinating especially how all the gospels, blues and other songs are entirely integrated in real life in the very story of the film. They are part and parcel of it all and that shows how music, poetry, religion are one only thing that gets its life from and gives life to the real world. But... The desire to give a picture of the Black world in America as being an entirely self-contained society leads to two regrettable elements. For one the Blacks are not exploited by banks, by white society, by white capitalism. Then they have to contain the causes and reasons of all that is evil in their midst. And we have it all indeed. The main poor character gambles the money of the cotton harvest of his family and loses it to a Black cheater who uses fake dice and is using a woman to bait and trap Zeke into the game. Then Zeke will kill his brother in the ensuing brawl. Then he will become a preacher and will finally marry the woman who had gotten him into the dice game when she pretends to have changed and repented her evil ways. Yet she will try to elope with the gambler. Zeke will chase them, kill his wife and then the man. He will end up in a force labor camp, still with no whites anywhere. He will be paroled and go home to find all his family happy and forgiving. We then understand and have to admit the fable is nave and even vicious  since it exonerates the whites of all their responsibility for the morally and socially deprived Black community they relentlessly exploit, down to their very bones and blood. It may represent the Black nationalist movement of the time (the 1920s) but it shows how artificial and racist in the end this vision can be. Does the music save this tale? Probably not, even if it shows how much the music is embedded and encrusted in both the Blacks and the US.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,How much Black nationalism has aged !!!,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,2567,"['First', 'talky', 'Vidor', 'only', 'Black', 'Afro-American', 'actors', 'second', 'film', 'quadrilogy', 'intended', 'reflect', 'great', '1929', 'depression', 'was', 'throw', 'US', 'arms', 'history', 'reformism', 'social', 'progress', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'WW2', 'finally', 'come', 'real', 'leap', 'forward', 'never', 'been', 'finished', 'nevertheless', 'film', 'first', 'how', 'much', 'US', 'owed', 'Blacks', 'had', 'imported', 'enslaved', 'cattle', 'were', 'starting', 'conquer', 'human', 'position', 'deeply', 'unjust', 'society', 'cultural', 'development', 'brought', 'invested', 'US', 'music', 'musical', 'side', 'film', 'fascinating', 'especially', 'how', 'gospels', 'blues', 'other', 'songs', 'are', 'entirely', 'integrated', 'real', 'life', 'very', 'story', 'film', 'are', 'part', 'parcel', 'how', 'music', 'poetry', 'religion', 'are', 'one', 'only', 'thing', 'life', 'life', 'real', 'world', 'desire', 'give', 'picture', 'Black', 'world', 'America', 'being', 'entirely', 'self-contained', 'society', 'two', 'regrettable', 'elements', 'one', 'Blacks', 'are', 'not', 'exploited', 'banks', 'white', 'society', 'white', 'capitalism', 'Then', 'have', 'contain', 'causes', 'reasons', 'evil', 'midst', 'have', 'indeed', 'main', 'poor', 'character', 'money', 'cotton', 'harvest', 'family', 'Black', 'cheater', 'who', 'fake', 'dice', 'using', 'woman', 'bait', 'trap', 'Zeke', 'game', 'Then', 'Zeke', 'will', 'kill', 'brother', 'ensuing', 'brawl', 'Then', 'will', 'become', 'preacher', 'will', 'finally', 'marry', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'gotten', 'dice', 'game', 'when', 'have', 'changed', 'repented', 'evil', 'ways', 'will', 'try', 'elope', 'gambler', 'Zeke', 'will', 'chase', 'kill', 'wife', 'then', 'man', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'force', 'labor', 'camp', 'still', 'whites', 'anywhere', 'will', 'be', 'paroled', 'go', 'home', 'find', 'family', 'happy', 'forgiving', 'then', 'understand', 'have', 'admit', 'fable', 'nave', 'even', 'vicious', 'whites', 'responsibility', 'morally', 'socially', 'deprived', 'Black', 'community', 'relentlessly', 'exploit', 'down', 'very', 'bones', 'blood', 'may', 'represent', 'Black', 'nationalist', 'movement', 'time', '1920s', 'how', 'artificial', 'racist', 'end', 'vision', 'can', 'be', 'music', 'save', 'tale', 'Probably', 'not', 'even', 'how', 'much', 'music', 'embedded', 'encrusted', 'Blacks', 'US.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

It's one of the greatest movies you ever want to see it's filled with music, drama, and even comedy with various great, unsung talents who became characters that you can relate to, forget the color, look at the talents and the stories, to some this movie may seem racial stereotypical but the talents of this movie become true actors and actresses and natural too. This film was nominated and I believe King Vidor won for the best director of picture. Obviously this is a sign of discrimination. Nina brought that movie alive for Vidor, without her Vidor wouldn't have won an Award but Hollywood wasn't ready yet to nominate a Black for anything even if they are deserving.This is Nina Mae McKinney's trademark movie, being very knowledeable of her work, I must say you shouldn't believe everything you read about her in books. She's one of many who so-called researchers don't know about but write what they think they know. They make her look like a one-hit wonder for sure. If you check her out in ""They Learned About Women,"" ""Safe In Hell,"" ""Sanders of the River"" with Paul Robeson, ""Gang Smashers,"" ""Straight To Heaven,"" ""The Devil's Daughter,"" ""Night Train to Memphis,"" ""Pinky,"" ""Pie Pie Blackbird,"" ""The Black Network,"" and countless of others, you know she wasn't a one hit wonder. Many of her time said, she had the best chances of any colored girl. She was the first black to do many things. Nina was the first black beauty of Hollywood and even the first to star in European movies. She did more movies than Horne and Dandridge, many films that aren't even credited to her. Many of her movies are sitting in vaults collecting dust. She was the first Black to break stereotypes, showing Blacks could handle roles and be more than just Blacks, but human beings capable of playing any role given to them. She has many films where she let her light shine whether in acting, singing, dancing or comedy. Most of all her movies are available showing her versatile talents. Even in later years in Hollywood where she did play a maid she was more than just someone ""maiding"" around, she made her roles work in her favor and made herself apart of the cast, nothing stereotypical about that. She didn't think she was too good for a maid role but she love being on screen and playing versatile roles. When Hollywood wasn't in her favor, she had other talents to fall back on she was called a triple threat, she was a wonderful singer and dancer that performed at the most popular theaters and nightclubs in the U.S. and Europe even giving command performances for royalty. She has so much achievements to her name, more than most so it's stupid to dewell on what she didn't do....look at what she did do. There are things about her you all don't know, even professional researchers don't. I took it upon myself to research her life and career and what I came up with is astonishing, I feel I should tell her story since others have failed to and many lies have been told about her. Many of her contemporaries loved and respected her for being an all-around versatile entertainer. She did it all in show business. She was the first Black in many mainstream magazines, even on the cover of magazines like Time, Vanity Fair, Photoplay and so on. She recorded songs that are available, many movies to her name showing her versatile talents, many magazines and articles from her time era that she appeared in. She conquered Hollywood, Europe and Black Cinema. She was truly the hardest working woman in show business but you never know it if you read some of these early Black Hollywood books that include her. In her time, she was called the most beautiful woman of her era and the greatest acting discovery. She had the most fascinating life and she was one who didn't let others hold her back because of her race, she made others look at her talent besides her color and that's why she was one of the biggest stars of her time. Though many may not know her today, there are many early Black talents who were very popular stars in their time but forgotten today, its not their fault, some are remembered, some aren't because of not getting a chance to tell their story, but that's changing. Many like Nina Mae, Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Francine Everett, and many others are starting to get more recognition. I would like to correct a poster below...Nina was married first to the same man Billie Holiday married, Jimmy Monroe, secondly, she did not maid for famous white stars except for on the screen.Obviously, Dorothy Dandridge relative on here is either jealous others are getting more spotlight than Dorothy because no one but an idiot would put down someone else  to make their relative look good, don't contradict yourself saying all should been looked at as positive  movie stars than say such and such is better. If you don't like Nina, move on, let others have room who do, go post on people who you do like because you won't change our minds. I'm not particularly a big fan of Dandridge, can't understand her but I won't knock her or  her fans. Obviously  your jealous of something because we see the greatness in Nina Mae, her versatility, her being a great all around performer, no one makes it as she did who didn't have something. I'm not putting anyone a pedestal, I love all the individuality of the black actresses and  all of them should be known, from Hollywood to Black Cinema. But many are  shocked that they didn't know who Nina was and just now finding out about this great actress. Whites remember all  their stars, Blacks should too. Nina was in a class of her own when it came to acting, she wasn't the sad, pitiful black girl type but rather fun, exciting and a natural. Your right about not putting blacks on pedestals, because Nina Mae, Fredi Washington, Lena Horne, Dorothy Dandridge, Mildred Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Francine Everett, Suzette Harbin and Hilda Simms all got the same discrimination from whites and not fully given a fair chance to be an actress.I have a website on Nina Mae McKinney and other early Black female performers and actresses of the

The all-black cast isn't exactly what most African or European-Americans want to think of as representing blacks on film even in that era - there's no question it's full of stereotypes, and even if overall only the most unforgiving critics would call it an overtly ""racist"" film, it's still a bit hard to watch at times.  But those who shun this film are missing a marvel of camerawork and sound - Vidor was a major innovator in the area of post-dubbing and sychronizing sound, and in an era when many films featured nailed-down cameras and whispery, tinny low-volume soundtracks, HALLELUJAH! is alive, movin' and jammin'.  There are great tracking shots through smoky bars, down a town street at night, and perhaps most memorably through a cypress swamp at the climax, as murder is about to be done.Sure, the story is hoky, and the mammys, bucks, gamblers and loose women don't always present the subtle and nuanced views that we'd like to see of black characters at the time - but then again, no films from black or white directors did.  Oscar Micheaux, the only significant African-American director of the silent period who is remembered today, is every bit as stereotypical in his films.  And HALLELUJAH! conveys the joys and sorrows of a people pretty effectively I think through the character of Zeke, always beautifully voiced and sometimes fairly well acted by Daniel Haynes, as he falls into the gutter, rises up as a respected preacher, falls again through uncontrollable urges, and slowly picks himself up once again.  When he gets the godly mojo going, you'll want to believe him - he's got an extraordinary charisma, and the film is at its best in the overtly religious scenes.  The rest of the cast, similarly, is impressive in the musical numbers and sometimes a little rough in the more dramatic moments, but with scenes like the powerful revival meeting as Zeke meets Chick and tries to stave off the Devil, I can't say it much bothered me.The music is a mix of gospel, old-time, jazz and accoustic blues, and it's all pretty effortlessly melded into the admittedly thin plot.  One touch I particularly liked was the appearance twice of Irving Berlin's ""Waiting At the End of the Road"" - first as a joyous, secular song and second as a rather somber religious number, with only minimal changes in lyrics and style.Included on this fine Warner Brothers disc are a couple of jazzy musical shorts from the 30s, PIE PIE BLACKBIRD and THE BLACK NETWORK, both lots of fun if not essential, as the feature is.  There's also a commentary track that I've listened to bits of which seems fairly valuable.  Certainly HALLELUJAH! is far from a flawless film, being amateurish and laughable even at times, but it is heartfelt, unique and extremely powerful in its best moments, and another masterpiece from one of the greatest directors of this era.  Anyone interested in the director, the history of African-Americans on film, the development of the musical - or just in great and unique cinema - really has to check this out.",5,"all-talking, all-singing, all-black and just about all-wonderful",1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,3912,"['Zeke', 'younger', 'brother', 'Spunk', 'Mammy', 'Pappy', 'are', 'sharecroppers', 'nameless', 'part', 'south', 'Zeke', 'powerful', 'lust', 'Missy', 'Rose', 'tries', 'get', 'good', 'stuff', 'playing', 'organ', 'neighbor', 'wedding', 'off', 'next', 'day', 'when', 'town', 'sell', 'cotten', 'about', 'lighter-skinned', 'dancer', 'Chick', 'powerful', 'seductress', 'convinces', 'blow', 'money', 'earned', 'family', 'gambling', 'so', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'more', 'spend', 'unbeknownest', 'Zeke', 'confederate', 'Hot', 'Shot', 'two', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'forever', '.King', 'Vidor', '1929', 'all-talking', 'all-singing', 'all-dancing', 'all-colored', 'film', 'landmark', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'more', 'highly', 'regarded', 'today', 'not', 'political', 'correctness', 'all-black', 'cast', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'most', 'African', 'European-Americans', 'want', 'think', 'representing', 'blacks', 'film', 'even', 'era', 'question', 'full', 'stereotypes', 'even', 'overall', 'only', 'most', 'unforgiving', 'critics', 'would', 'call', 'overtly', 'racist', 'film', 'still', 'bit', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'who', 'shun', 'film', 'are', 'missing', 'marvel', 'camerawork', 'sound', 'Vidor', 'was', 'major', 'innovator', 'area', 'post-dubbing', 'sychronizing', 'sound', 'era', 'when', 'many', 'films', 'featured', 'nailed-down', 'cameras', 'whispery', 'tinny', 'low-volume', 'soundtracks', 'HALLELUJAH', 'alive', 'movin', 'jammin', 'are', 'great', 'tracking', 'shots', 'smoky', 'bars', 'down', 'town', 'street', 'night', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorably', 'cypress', 'swamp', 'climax', 'murder', 'be', 'done.Sure', 'story', 'hoky', 'mammys', 'bucks', 'gamblers', 'loose', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'present', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'views', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'black', 'characters', 'time', 'then', 'again', 'films', 'black', 'white', 'directors', 'did', 'Oscar', 'Micheaux', 'only', 'significant', 'African-American', 'director', 'silent', 'period', 'who', 'remembered', 'today', 'bit', 'stereotypical', 'films', 'HALLELUJAH', 'conveys', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'people', 'pretty', 'effectively', 'think', 'character', 'Zeke', 'always', 'beautifully', 'voiced', 'sometimes', 'fairly', 'well', 'acted', 'Daniel', 'Haynes', 'gutter', 'up', 'respected', 'preacher', 'again', 'uncontrollable', 'urges', 'slowly', 'picks', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'When', 'godly', 'mojo', 'going', ""'ll"", 'want', 'believe', 'got', 'extraordinary', 'charisma', 'film', 'best', 'overtly', 'religious', 'scenes', 'rest', 'cast', 'similarly', 'impressive', 'musical', 'numbers', 'little', 'rough', 'more', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'scenes', 'powerful', 'revival', 'meeting', 'Zeke', 'Chick', 'tries', 'stave', 'off', 'Devil', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'bothered', 'me.The', 'music', 'mix', 'gospel', 'old-time', 'jazz', 'accoustic', 'blues', 'pretty', 'effortlessly', 'melded', 'admittedly', 'thin', 'plot', 'One', 'touch', 'particularly', 'liked', 'was', 'appearance', 'twice', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'Waiting', 'End', 'Road', 'first', 'joyous', 'secular', 'song', 'second', 'rather', 'somber', 'religious', 'number', 'only', 'minimal', 'changes', 'lyrics', 'style.Included', 'fine', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'disc', 'are', 'couple', 'jazzy', 'musical', 'shorts', '30s', 'PIE', 'PIE', 'BLACKBIRD', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'NETWORK', 'lots', 'fun', 'not', 'essential', 'feature', 'also', 'commentary', 'track', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'bits', 'fairly', 'valuable', 'Certainly', 'HALLELUJAH', 'far', 'flawless', 'film', 'being', 'amateurish', 'laughable', 'even', 'times', 'heartfelt', 'unique', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'best', 'moments', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'era', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'director', 'history', 'African-Americans', 'film', 'development', 'musical', 'just', 'great', 'unique', 'cinema', 'really', 'check', 'out']",N/A

There are times when King Vidor lingers on the faces of men and women, raptured with God; or an even more beautiful scene of young black children waving little American flags.This movie is about Zeke (man) who after accidently killing his brother finds God and becomes a preacher. But Temptation and the Devil is just around the corner in the form Chick and her sugar daddy, Hot Shot. Poor Zeke and Chick go back and forth, running to and then abandoning God.Victoria Spivey plays Missy Rose, a girl that loves Zeke. Missy Rose is the embodiment of God, loving Zeke, mourning him when he leaves her, and then rejoicing when he returns.When Zeke asks Missy Rose if she remembers him and she replies: ""Of course, Zeke.

329101,A3LPQAPU2ILDD0,6302717760,R. McRae,"[0, 0]","Daniel L. Haynes, the actor portraying the lead character of ""Zeke"" was a Denzel Washington born ahead of his time. The same is true of the captivating Nina Mae McKinney, a forerunner of say Dorothy Dandridge or Halle Berry. Two powerful screen performances from one of Hollywood's first talkies(1929). Sure the stereotypes are evident, but with story telling that is still relevant for today, especially in our modern society of loose morals and uncontrolled passions.Zeke's innocent and somewhat gullible character is tempted, after he delivers to town and receives payment for his poor family's cotton farming endeavors, by the allurements of a beautiful young woman(Ms. McKinney), known simply as ""Chick."" Who flirts with and seduces him into a crooked fixed-dice gambling loss with her accomplice and apparent lover ""Hot Shot"". All the families hard earned money is squandered away. Seeking revenge, Zeke overpowers the conman's gun and fires it wildly into the bar crowd. Whether by his own rage or from the initial shots fired by his crooked intended target, his younger brother ""Spunk"" is killed. He returns home to his worried mother and father the next morning, a broken man, with his dead brother lying in the back of the wagon. During a mournful funeral service in which he couldn't find self-forgiveness to enter the church, his forgiving father exits the church and finds Zeke lying prostrate with grief. Looking to the heavens, his father encourages him to look to the deliverer for forgiveness.Zeke finds ""religion"" as we flash forward to his extremely popular evangelistic efforts as ""the prophet."" And while parading through the streets on the back of a donkey, cheered on by hundreds, he is mocked by the same young temptress and Hot Shot. She even heckles him while he's preaching in a later scene, until the conviction of being the only soul left in the audience not to respond to brother Zeke's altar call. She is brought to tears and cries out for bro. Zeke to save her from the devil as well. But as we are taken to the baptism of converts, Ms. McKinney, at her loveliest, adorned in a white robe awaiting her turn to be baptized in the river, is caught up in the spirit of emotion and sinks into the arms of the prophet, who under a hypnotic spell, carries her away into a nearby tent, in full view of the multitude, with not so religious intent. His Godly mother soon follows them inside the tent and pulls her wayward son back to his senses. And at a later church revival, Bro. Zeke again loses all sense of moral judgement, when he spies her in the congregation ""caught-up in the Spirit"" and steps from the pulpit, into the ecstatic crowd where they meet, as she, under the guise of emotionalism, lures him out the church door and they run away together, hand-in-hand into a life of sin. Zeke's fiance, ""Missy Rose"" franticly follows them into the woods, searching in vain and crying out: ""Don't leave me Zeke!"" But their's is not a happy ending; tragic even. I won't spoil the rest of the story.If for no other reason, a unique addition of historic value to any movie lover's collection.

329102,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6302717760,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","""Hallelujah"",released in August of 1929,is a movie that was much better in intention and idea by famed director King Vidor,than in its' final execution on film.The film is ultimately weighed down by its'theme and the music which enhances it;interwoven throughout.One of the first all-black cast movies/musicals it may have been,but it is more a testament to and furthering of movie making in general than a furtherance of the black condition that existed at that time.The story is about peace,sin,death,redemption and finally peace again;life in full circle,as experienced through a totally black perspective.No whites appear at any time in the film;a plus or minus depending on your perspective.It opens with the strains of ""Swanee River"" and concerns the story of Zeke(Dan Haynes)who lives on a cotton plantation with his family,Mammy(Fanny DeKnight),Father/Parson(Harry Gray),Spunk,his brother(Everitt McGarrity)and Missy Rose(Victoria Spivey).After a particularly successful crop of cotton is picked Zeke is off to the cotton mill to sell it,with Spunk.With $50 in hand a dancer,Chick(Nina Mckinney) catches his eye.Before he knows it he is playing a crooked game of craps with her compatriot and boyfriend Hot Shot(Bill Founatine).A scuffle ensues and Spunk who has been searching for Zeke arrives on the scene just as shots are fired,and he dies enroute home.Zeke is beside himself and is too ashamed to attend his brothers' funeral.His pastor father comforts him with words of Grace and Zeke becomes reborn.Zeke now ""Ezekial the Prophet"" travels the countryside on a train,preaching the good Word to all who will listen and performing baptismals in nearby rivers.At one such stop Chick resurfaces with Hot Shot in tow,who set into beratting him as he passes(riding ala' Jesus on a donkey!).Later Chick attends his outside sermon and she becomes a convert to his preachings.During her baptismal she is overcome and he takes her into a tent where his amooruous feelings start to get the better of him until Mammy walks in and interupts him.It is just a reprieve as during an evening revival meeting at a church Chick again attends but this time the  two slip away,leaving his stunned parents,congregation and Miss Rosy to whom he had expressed intentions of marrying a short while before,in disbelief.We next find Zeke now working in a sawmill.Upon his return home one day there is a suspicious buggy parked outside his house.Unbeknownst to him Chick has re-connected with Hot Shot and she plans to leave Zeke.When Zeke falls asleep she sneaks out of the house.As the two make their get away Zeke unrelentingly follows them on foot.At one point a wheel breaks off sending Chick flying onto the ground.Her wounds are fatal and she dies in Zeke's arms.Inconsolable Zeke pursues Hot Shot along the road,through the woods and into a swamp where he finally catches him and kills him.Zeke is caught and sentenced to hard time and finally gets released.Riding the rails back home(singing ""Coming Home"")he arrives and walks back down the dirt roads he knows so well.His mother is the first to greet him after which the entire family joins in.His father tells him he is just in time to help with the cotton picking and he and Missy Rose are reconciled once more.Vidor,a Texan by birth,wanted to do something along the lines of the successful 1927 stage play ""Porgy"",but on film.He met with vehement opposition by many and finally offered to put up his share of his salary in order to do it.When he arrived in Memphis,Tennesse to do film it,none of the sound equipment had arrived.So he went ahead and filmed it as a ""silent"" picture and added additional scenes in the studio in Hollywood.However all sound filmed on location were recorded and edited in LATER! An astounding and unimaginable undertaking at that time,which caused one of the editors to go beserk and smash a reel of film against a wall.Being shot silent however allowed for a better flow of camera movement.Most of these early takies were necessarily static creatures,filmed in scenes where the actors gathered around a central mike overhead or ones hidden strategically in plants or elsewhere on the set;and all cameras were sealed in large boxes to minimize noise.Location shooting was a rarity.Many of the scene's re the black experience,DID ring true for the day such as Hot Shot's crap shooting,the revival meetings in the south and the resultant fervour of its' congregations,Zekes' train-like preaching technique used countless times,the unloading,baling and loading of the cotton onto steamboats and even Chick singing ""The St Louis Blues"" when she was going to leave Zeke(common practice when giving the air to a hubby or sweetheart!).Many scenes also are quite gripping such as his brother's death scene in the bar when he is first shot,Chicks death scene and Zekes' chasing of Hot Shot through the swamp.Where the film falters is in Vidor's stretching of every major scene throughout most of the film.From the opening scenes at Zeke's home to his later sermons,all are stretched well beyond what they should be.It is understandable that Vidor wanted to enhance the ""flavour"" of each scene but it gets a bit tedious.This goes on for most of the movie until the last five to ten minutes after we see Zeke kill Hot Shot.From here the movie zooms to its' conclusion from Zeke on the rock pile,travelling home on the rails and then reuniting with his family.It is disturbingly fast and noticable.Also Vidor wants us to believe that blacks are oft times sexually obssessed and almost childlike in their fears and no matter what they do,in the end it matters not what crime they have committed or what they have done,all will be instantly forgiven.This does not ring true at all,no matter what culture we view;now or in the past.Vidor was one of the great directors of his time(""The Big Parade"",""The Crowd"",""The Champ"",etc.),but I believe his intention and his furtherance of movie making triumphed here far more than did his actual execution of the film he ultimately created.Unfortunately I am not reviewing his intentions,no matter how well founded they were.I am reviewing his product(its' structure,story and presentation) and as such I can only give it at BEST three stars.Technically this film does show its' age but generally speaking it is a good print and has been transferred quite well.Two two-reelers are here  from the Warner's vaults that are,to me,more exciting than the main attraction.First is the Vitaphone ""Pie,Pie Blackbird"" and it gives us the debut of one of the greatest dance teams ever to have graced a stage;the Nicholaus Brothers.Looking much younger than the 18 years Fayard was and the 11 Harold was,both do a smooth and great job for the camera.Fayard can be seen more than a few times smiling off camera as Harold does his part,as if to say ""Is that all right,guys?"".Nina McKinney sings ""Everything I have is Yours"" with Eubie Blake and band who also perform ""Smoke Rings"" and ""You Rascal You"".The second Vitaphone short is from 1936,""Black Network"".It stars legendary and multi-talented black singer,composer and poet Babe Wallace,Nina McKinney,Amanda Randolph(best known for her later role as Louise on TV as Danny Thomas' maid-she sings ""Something's Wrong with Me""...hilarious) and again the Nicholaus Brothers appear.The boys tackle a song and dance number called""Lucky Numbers"",and what a difference four years made.Here they are quite slick looking in suits and their dancing has gotten even better.In conclusion ""Hallelujah"", while having the best of intentions just does not come through in the finished product.It is historically important,being one of the earliest sound films and all black musicals,but does little to further the black experience.The film rings true in its'depictions of certain aspects of day to day life(cotton picking,revival meetings,et al),but falls apart in the morality department and in most major scenes,which Vidor must have felt were important to give the audience a better appreciation of black life,were in fact much too long and should have been more judiciously edited.What are the best kicks to me,are the two Vitaphone shorts with the Nicholaus Brothers,particlularly their debut short ""Pie,Pie Blackbird"".",3,Hallelujah-a movie

329104,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6302717760,"""scotsladdie""","[7, 9]","King Vidor, this film's director was vitally interested in social issues: here he wanted to show the rest of 1929 America what the black man was going through.  This early talkie was the first all-black feature film and indeed one of the boldest pictures ever made - M-G-M knew it wouldn't get much of a release in the deep Southern states of the U.S.  Using many amateurs - for instance, Harry Gray - who played the Parson - was a janitor at a Harlem newspaper - Vidor proved his genius by elicting performances from the melange as good as might be seen in a seasoned troupe. Shot on location in Tennessee, every frame is redolent with authenticity: it's a huge film and no expense was spared to recreate various eras.  The love scenes are realistically and believably executed, and the film doesn't date nearly as much as one would suppose. In my opinion, Nina Mae McKinney was a fascinating performer who should have had more to do in films: here she plays Chick, a vibrant beauty among lowlifes.  Some of the picture gets overly dramatic - with Holy Roller meetings, a wake, cabarets and various Plantation scenes -but its filled with humanity and a true understanding of the way it was back then.  Tunes include AT THE END OF THE ROAD, SWANEE SHUFFLE by Irving Berlin and nearly every well-known spritual ever written.
