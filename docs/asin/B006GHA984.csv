I'd tried to get my hands on a copy of the film adaptation. It was worth the wait. The film is a good adaptation of the JM Barrie play - it still has its humor, bite, and romance firmly in tact. Kenneth More is - as usual - excellent, as is the budding Sally Ann Howes. The only pity is issuing it under the name Paradise Lagoon rather than The Admirable Crichton.",5,At Long Last - Available in the US!,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,492,"['saw', 'Admirable', 'Crichton', 'London', 'teen', 'then', 'again', 'last', 'year', 'Shaw', 'Festival', 'Niagara', 'Lake', ""'d"", 'tried', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'film', 'adaptation', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'film', 'good', 'adaptation', 'JM', 'Barrie', 'play', 'still', 'humor', 'bite', 'romance', 'firmly', 'tact', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'usual', 'excellent', 'budding', 'Sally', 'Ann', 'Howes', 'only', 'pity', 'issuing', 'name', 'Paradise', 'Lagoon', 'rather', 'Admirable', 'Crichton']",N/A

I have been trying to find a copy of this film for many years and I was not disappointed.  The only thing that has changed is my appreciation of the ending, which is much better now than when I was 18; Crichton had to marry the Tweenie and not the aristocrat, despite the passion - marriage is more than just that.  At 66 you know that much better.As to the movie making - I had expected the production values would have faded, but no!

1515007,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B006GHA984,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","PARADISE ISLAND (UK title THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON) is a Technicolor version of the old Barrie classic.  Filmed by Rank at the height of its studio period, it stars Kenneth More in the eponymous role as the butler who manages to adapt to life on a desert island.  More isn't the most obvious personality to play a butler - his breezy screen persona projected a more louche image than that expected of a gentleman in service - but he makes a good stab at the role.  He is complemented in the film by Cecil Parker as his employer.  A much underrated actor, Parker was extremely good at playing harassed males of a certain vintage - outwardly authoritative yet inwardly insecure.  In this production it's clear that he cannot manage without Crichton.  Director Lewis Gilbert handles familiar material with &eacute;lan, making this a satisfying piece of entertainment.",3,Straightforward Version of a Theatrical Warhorse,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,862,"['PARADISE', 'ISLAND', 'UK', 'THE', 'ADMIRABLE', 'CRICHTON', 'Technicolor', 'version', 'old', 'Barrie', 'classic', 'Filmed', 'Rank', 'height', 'studio', 'period', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'eponymous', 'role', 'butler', 'who', 'adapt', 'life', 'desert', 'island', 'More', ""n't"", 'most', 'obvious', 'personality', 'play', 'butler', 'breezy', 'screen', 'persona', 'projected', 'more', 'louche', 'image', 'expected', 'gentleman', 'service', 'good', 'stab', 'role', 'complemented', 'film', 'Cecil', 'Parker', 'employer', 'much', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Parker', 'was', 'extremely', 'good', 'playing', 'harassed', 'males', 'certain', 'vintage', 'outwardly', 'authoritative', 'yet', 'inwardly', 'insecure', 'production', 'clear', 'can', 'not', 'manage', 'Crichton', 'Director', 'Lewis', 'Gilbert', 'familiar', 'material', 'eacute', 'lan', 'making', 'satisfying', 'piece', 'entertainment']",N/A

So, avoid the PAL version unless you prefer an aspect ration of 4:3 and a lower quality version of the film and you have a region free DVD player.Although Amazon has it listed as ""The Admirable Crichton,"" as you can see this version has the title of ""Paradise Lagoon"" denoting that it's the American version. Nevertheless, either title can be used to find this wonderful film.There's no menu, no extras and no selecting of scenes and when the movie ends, it just starts playing all over again.But, it doesn't matter.  It's got good quality and the wide-screen format--and besides you really don't need the other extras--remember VHS?It's a great family flick--and it makes you wonder if you're really free in today's world.",5,Better Than The PAL Version.,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,1248,"['grand', 'movie.It', 'type', 'movie', 'hollywood', 'forgotten', 'formula', 'too.It', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'PAL', 'version', 'quality-wise', 'format-wise.The', 'PAL', 'version', 'lot', 'defects', 'constantly', 'show', 'up', 'much', 'more', 'grainy', 'aspect', 'ration', '4:3.It', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'cleaned.This', 'newly', 'available', 'version', 'print', 'demand', 'version', 'purple', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'higherquality', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'based', 'fact', 'covers', 'entire', 'screen', 'was', 'verypleasant', 'surprise', 'So', 'avoid', 'PAL', 'version', 'prefer', 'aspect', 'ration', '4:3', 'lower', 'quality', 'version', 'film', 'have', 'region', 'free', 'DVD', 'player.Although', 'Amazon', 'listed', 'Admirable', 'Crichton', 'can', 'see', 'version', 'title', 'Paradise', 'Lagoon', 'denoting', 'American', 'version', 'Nevertheless', 'either', 'title', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'find', 'wonderful', 'menu', 'extras', 'selecting', 'scenes', 'when', 'movie', 'just', 'playing', 'again.But', ""n't"", 'matter', 'got', 'good', 'quality', 'wide-screen', 'format', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'other', 'extras', 'remember', 'VHS', 'great', 'family', 'flick', 'wonder', ""'re"", 'really', 'free', 'today', 'world']",N/A
