1514802,A3GUZIX0ITZORF,B006ESH2CQ,applewood,"[22, 22]","Wow, Richard Thompson, what a master (musician, song-smith, performer)!This show from January 25th, 2011, recorded in Scotland after almost a year of steady touring that began in February 2010 (recorded as the albumDream Attic), consisting of two parts, new songs (played here in the same order as the album) and a selection of old favorites, is pretty much the same as what I heard at the start of the tour in Seattle, except that 2 songs from that earlier recording are missing (""Crimescene"" and ""Bad Again""). Although I can't remember the exact set list from the excellent, more stretched out second half, it sounds similar. The band is the same (really good, with Taras Prodaniuk on bass, and Joe Zifkin on violin and mandolin, joining RT's old reliable multi-instrumentalist Pete Zorn and drummer Michael Jerome), and  the songs are clearly well known by this point, so what we get to hear probably makes RT really happy. It makes the fans happy too.For any Richard Thompson fan this is a must have DVD (since the killer second set isn't part of Dream Attic, and their performance of ""Can't Win"" is worth the price of admission alone). Film (high def, sharp and clear) and sound quality is top notch, and the performance seems to be a special one as well. I admit, seeing them here on DVD is even better than it was live.As a bonus we get two solo acoustic performances, one of my favorites - ""Uninhabited Man"", and the other the appropriately Celtic, ""Johnny's Far Away"", to a large enthusiastic crowd at the Cambridge Folk Festival - 1/19/11.

1514803,AIGDGDTU05BWK,B006ESH2CQ,"Ew Goodrich ""uncle willy""","[2, 2]","RT is not for everyone!  This is a great RT offering.  I think ""Dream Attic"" is one of his best, some reviewers disagree but I put it with ""Rumor and Sigh"" or ""Shoot out the Lights"" or many other outstanding projects.  The band is great: they've been together long enough to really get it, the sound is superb, the photography is not perfect but close enough.  RT is MY favorite singer/songwriter from the UK and has been since Fairport  Convention and this DVD is probably the best of his DVDs.  If you're an RT fan but don't have one of his DVDs and wondering which to buy, this is it!  His catalogue of music is huge and this is just a small offering but will give you a perspective of what he is about!
