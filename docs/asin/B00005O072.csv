671097,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B00005O072,Michael J. Edelman,"[0, 0]","Yes, it's British comedy- but not in the Monty Python vein. Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones had a very fruitful partnership for many years writing and performing in a series of ""Smith and Jones"" television shows, in which they presented exceedingly silly parodies in a completely deadpan manner, and in Morons from Outer Space they have succeeded admirably.The plot is simple: Four aliens- one of them of average intelligence (by Earth standards) and the other three about as smart as a rock- are out for a joyride when the intelligent one (Smith) gets separated from the ship, and the other three crash it into the Earth. What follows is a broad satire of all the traditional sci-fi conventions along with sly shots at ET, Star Wars, Close Encounters, and no doubt other films as well. The aliens are investigated by scientists, hunted by the military, until finally they find their place as... well, I won't spoil it for you.I'd never heard of this film until I discovered it playing on a local TV station late one night. I didn't expect much, as sketch comedy rarely translates into feature length films, but Smith and Jones' did a fine job with creating a solid, ridiculous plot that carries the viewer along to the end with plenty of smiles and a few laugh out loud moments as well.",4,Delightfully silly,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,1286,"['Yes', 'British', 'comedy-', 'not', 'Monty', 'Python', 'vein', 'Mel', 'Smith', 'Griff', 'Rhys', 'Jones', 'had', 'very', 'fruitful', 'partnership', 'many', 'years', 'writing', 'performing', 'series', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'television', 'shows', 'presented', 'exceedingly', 'silly', 'parodies', 'completely', 'deadpan', 'manner', 'Morons', 'Outer', 'Space', 'have', 'succeeded', 'admirably.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'Four', 'aliens-', 'one', 'average', 'intelligence', 'Earth', 'standards', 'other', 'three', 'as', 'smart', 'rock-', 'are', 'out', 'joyride', 'when', 'intelligent', 'one', 'Smith', 'separated', 'ship', 'other', 'three', 'crash', 'Earth', 'What', 'broad', 'satire', 'traditional', 'sci-fi', 'conventions', 'sly', 'shots', 'ET', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'doubt', 'other', 'films', 'well', 'aliens', 'are', 'investigated', 'scientists', 'hunted', 'military', 'finally', 'find', 'place', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'you.I', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'discovered', 'playing', 'local', 'TV', 'station', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'rarely', 'feature', 'length', 'films', 'Smith', 'Jones', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'creating', 'solid', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'viewer', 'end', 'plenty', 'smiles', 'few', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'well']",Morons from Outer Space
671098,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005O072,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 5]","""Morons From Outer Space"" is a great concept for a parody. Four daft aliens crash their ""Podule"" on Earth due to their own incompetence. Earthlings are prepared to accept their hyperintelligence as a given, but they are collectively as dumb as a box of hair. Most of the comedy is very broad with occasionally amusing bits of satire thrown in (particularly related to the Cold War.) For instance, when the alcohol-guzzling space loons crash their ship in England, they do so on the M1 motorway, causing a substantial traffic snarl. What is the punch line to the scene? After being nearly run down by the Podule, one motorist says to another ""I think he was Belgian."" Hilarious, no?The aliens are split into a group of three, Julian Tope (Paul Bown,) Sandra Brock (Joanne Pearce,) and Desmond Brock (Jimmy Nail) who are staggeringly imbecilic. The humor associated them was so sub-Benny Hill I could almost not take it (don't miss the hilarity of the exploding cooker scene.) The remaining moron in question, Bernard (Mel Smith,) is actually only slightly mentally-deficient, but spends the bulk of the film in a mental hospital (not funny,) talking to garbage cans (somewhat funny the first couple of times, not so funny thereafter,) and trying to get his former friends to acknowledge him (oh, the pathos.) Obviously there's a lesson in there about the meaning of true friendship, but it's pointless in a farce of this nature. Throughout this movie I couldn't think of Mel Smith as anything other than an actor trying to do his best John Candy impression in a film that would have actually been suitable to Candy's choice of roles. I think Smith and Griff Rhys Jones who plays Graham Sweetley can be quite talented writers and performers (much better than John Candy,) but their efforts here come up way short.There were a few touches in the writing that were quirky and funny (e.g. ""When you're in the tub and a man-eating spider crawls out of the faucet, you don't ask him to pass you the soap."") There were even a few funny satirical concepts, as when Bernard defeated the asylum employees who tormented him with an ""Iron Maiden"" album by wearing earplugs. Sadly though, for each amusing moment there are a hundredfold more like the execrable worst ping pong lesson ever.There are a few nuggets of humor in here, but while I love British cinema and television, and I love satire and comedies, this is less playful than it is painful.",2,"If Aliens Hunting Squirrels And Talking To Garbage Cans Is Something You'd Like, This Movie's For You",1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,2437,"['Morons', 'Outer', 'Space', 'great', 'concept', 'parody', 'Four', 'daft', 'aliens', 'crash', 'Podule', 'Earth', 'due', 'own', 'incompetence', 'Earthlings', 'are', 'prepared', 'accept', 'hyperintelligence', 'given', 'are', 'collectively', 'as', 'dumb', 'box', 'hair', 'Most', 'comedy', 'very', 'broad', 'occasionally', 'amusing', 'bits', 'satire', 'thrown', 'particularly', 'related', 'Cold', 'War', 'instance', 'when', 'alcohol-guzzling', 'space', 'loons', 'crash', 'ship', 'England', 'do', 'so', 'M1', 'motorway', 'causing', 'substantial', 'traffic', 'snarl', 'What', 'punch', 'line', 'scene', 'being', 'nearly', 'run', 'down', 'Podule', 'one', 'motorist', 'think', 'was', 'Belgian', 'Hilarious', 'aliens', 'are', 'split', 'group', 'three', 'Julian', 'Tope', 'Paul', 'Bown', 'Sandra', 'Brock', 'Joanne', 'Pearce', 'Desmond', 'Brock', 'Jimmy', 'Nail', 'who', 'are', 'staggeringly', 'imbecilic', 'humor', 'associated', 'was', 'so', 'sub-Benny', 'Hill', 'could', 'almost', 'not', 'take', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'hilarity', 'exploding', 'cooker', 'scene', 'remaining', 'moron', 'question', 'Bernard', 'Mel', 'Smith', 'actually', 'only', 'slightly', 'mentally-deficient', 'bulk', 'film', 'mental', 'hospital', 'not', 'funny', 'talking', 'garbage', 'cans', 'somewhat', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'thereafter', 'trying', 'get', 'former', 'friends', 'acknowledge', 'oh', 'pathos', 'Obviously', 'lesson', 'meaning', 'true', 'friendship', 'pointless', 'farce', 'nature', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'Mel', 'Smith', 'anything', 'other', 'actor', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'John', 'Candy', 'impression', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'suitable', 'Candy', 'choice', 'roles', 'think', 'Smith', 'Griff', 'Rhys', 'Jones', 'who', 'Graham', 'Sweetley', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'talented', 'writers', 'performers', 'much', 'better', 'John', 'Candy', 'efforts', 'here', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'short.There', 'were', 'few', 'touches', 'writing', 'were', 'quirky', 'funny', 'e.g', 'When', ""'re"", 'tub', 'man-eating', 'spider', 'faucet', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'pass', 'soap', 'were', 'even', 'few', 'funny', 'satirical', 'concepts', 'when', 'Bernard', 'defeated', 'asylum', 'employees', 'who', 'tormented', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'album', 'wearing', 'earplugs', 'Sadly', 'amusing', 'moment', 'are', 'hundredfold', 'more', 'execrable', 'worst', 'ping', 'pong', 'lesson', 'are', 'few', 'nuggets', 'humor', 'here', 'love', 'British', 'cinema', 'television', 'love', 'satire', 'comedies', 'less', 'playful', 'painful']",Morons from Outer Space
671099,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B00005O072,Scott FS,"[1, 1]","'Morons from Outer Space' is a dumb, stupid, silly movie.  It's also fraught with laughs.  It's not a laugh a minute, but it's got some very, very funny scenes, including a take-off of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.'Four aliens vacationing in outer space in what looks like a third-rate motorhome get bored and decide to take a side trip to Earth.  Three land in England, and one lands in Arizona.  As the first aliens to visit the Earth, they are hailed as the super-intelligent beings they must be to travel the galaxy.  After a few minutes, though, it dawns on Earth's representatives that the aliens are complete and utter idiots.  For example, when asked what planet the visitors are from, one of the aliens (Julian) says he just can't remember.  However, it's blue-y and green-y and has some wispy clouds in the sky. Turns out it does have a name, very appropriate.The aliens soon wear out their welcome and become more of a side-show than objects of admiration.  One starts hawking beer while the three in England are on live television.  The movie goes downhill as they are promoted as rock stars in the 'Kiss' mode.It's a very British comedy, so if you like Monty Python and Death at a Funeral, you'll like this one.
