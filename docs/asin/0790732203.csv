99569,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0790732203,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 9/13Rate: 109/13: I find Risky Business a very good, realistic Tom Cruise picture. His acting is also very well-done and at an unbelievably high level. I am surprised that Rebecca De Mornay, knowing how much Hollywood loves its hookers, did not get a nomination for her performance because she equally made the film to work. Risky Business is a mix among American Gigolo, Eyes Wide Shut, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The middle is a film that Tom Cruise was in, but Risky Business has a better theme to work with. What's interesting is how much the movie reminds me of The Graduate, a film that I think is very overrated, with Dustin Hoffman due to the similarities. If I had to pick, it's Risky Business without a contest; it just seems to be more real and to the point. There is a feeling that to take a risk costs money, involves unforeseeable expenses, and questions the ultimate goal during a phase in a young man's life. However, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which is an all-time influential picture made three years later, sums it all up so perfectly and eloquently in a way that seems to capture the essence and remove the invisible barriers of life. Risky Business is the refined version that, through clothes, wealth, and luxury, is to be able to afford the risks without suffering too much of the consequences. As a matter of fact, this kind of thinking actually shaped the rest of the next three decades in America. Now, the people are willing to take shortcuts to acquire wealth in any way possible, try to last as long as possible before getting caught if done illegally, and are paying a high price for it through debt, jail, and/or embarrassment. Anyway, most importantly, Risky Business made Tom Cruise a household name that still exists to this day. That Princeton Interview scene is a classic.

Mediocre student and always-obedient son Joel (Cruise) is left alone in his upscale suburban house when his parents take a vacation.  It's Joel's senior year in high school and it appears that the only highlight is going to be a boring project for the Young Enterpriser Club contest.  When his friend Miles (Curtis Armstong) forces his hand to take a chance, Joel is thrown into an out-of-control scenario involving the charming prostitute Lana (Rebecca de Mornay), her enterprising friends, an irate pimp named Guido (Joe Pantoliano), and a high school full of unfilled but hormonally charged teenage boys.  Throw in Joel's father's Porsche, an application to Princeton, and the all-important midterms that Joel is in danger of failing - and you've got a fast-paced, hilarious flick of adolescence out of control.Unlike today's teen movies, &quot;Risky Business&quot; is not preoccupied with sophomoric humor and gratuitous foul language.  It's too smart a screenplay for that.  Instead, it focuses on the humor of a good boy gone temporarily bad, and how one small act of rebellion changes everything.  At times, the film tries to be artsy with its gimmicky camera shots, direction, and editing, thus dating the film more than the costumes and screenplay do, but overall it succeeds.  The music is great, particularly for those who remember the times.Dust off your memories and revisit this fun flick.

This is simply a great movie with convincing acting, superb music, good script and believable characters. While the plot isn't anything too original, the above mentioned qualities make this movie fun to watch. Tom Cruise, having the house to himself while his parents are away, carries out the fantasy of just about every adolescent male by basically turning his home into a party haven with the inevitable consequences that follow. Rebecca De Mornay (it should be illegal to look that good in a pair of tight jeans!) plays a prostitute that becomes Cruise's &quot;partner&quot; in the scheme of things and Joe Pantoliano plays her sleazy pimp and does a great job in his role.One thing that stands out about &quot;Risky Business&quot; is that while technically a comedy, the tone is often dark in terms of sequence of events and the eerie (yet great) instrumental music that pretty much makes up the soundtrack. While others might not really like this, I think it makes the movie stand out and avoid the over-the-top silliness that have caused many 80's comedies to become dated by today's standards. Don't get me wrong, I love those 80's movies, but &quot;Risky Business&quot; has a certain quality to it that takes on a more serious tone while also maintaining the fun element.And finally, I have to say that the DVD transfer is absolutely horrific. Extras are virtually non-existent and image/sound quality is abysmal. 2003 has come and almost gone, so by now it's pointless to hope for a 20th Anniversary Special Edition DVD.

If Joel, as played by Tom Cruise, had come from a blue collar family, one could argue that he could in time become Bud Fox (the Charlie Sheen character) from ""Wall Street.""I saw this movie when it first came out in 1983 and was exactly Joel's age and remember loving it just because it was cool, had great music, was funny, and (independently of some over the top comedic gems) rang very true to life. At the time it seemed that if you did not ace your SAT's, it would be the end of the world.

While so much had happened in these 2+ decades, the film could be released today and it would probably be a smash. Of course the studio, unfortunately would force the director to go for a PG-13 rating, thus taking away a great deal of the movie's best moments. For those who have kids, this is not a movie for them, as it earns its R rating.In a nutshell, the movie tells the coming of age story of Joel Goodsen, the perfect son from the perfect six figure earning suburban family. The family has the house, toys, values, and perfect lawn. Without giving anything away as I don't like reviews that reveal too much, the perfect son has the house to himself while his parents are out of town. The rest you'll have to experience for yourself.The performances are perfect across the board. Tom Cruise (before he became megastar ""Tom Cruise"" or had started jumping up and down like a madman on ""Oprah"") gives the movie its foundation, and he is supported by a brilliant cast (Rebecca De Morney is simply amazing), script and direction. The makers captured the feel of Joel's world (down to his Docksiders and Nikes) and the excitement that he was embarking on. I can't find much to quibble when it comes to this movie, but if I must, some of the kids did look a little long on the tooth (yes you Bronson Pinchot) to be in high school, but could you imagine ""Grease"" without Stockard Channing? I rest my case.If you are looking for an entertaining, funny, insightful movie that describes what it was to be 17 or 18 in 1983 (well if your parents had bucks), this would be a riskless choice. To those of us who have grown to dislike Tom Cruise in recent years, I can say that my biases were easily put aside as this performance put me in touch with a rising star. Like Julia Roberts in ""Pretty Woman,"" here Tom looked like regular guy (Ok, with above-average looks) who the audience could empathize with. Easily earns its 5 stars within its genre.",5,"Joel, get off the babysitter!",1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,2804,"['movie', 'touchstone', '1980', 'materialistic', 'transactional', 'values', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'prevalent', 'are', 'now', 'Joel', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'had', 'come', 'blue', 'collar', 'family', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'could', 'time', 'become', 'Bud', 'Fox', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'character', 'Wall', 'Street', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1983', 'was', 'exactly', 'Joel', 'age', 'remember', 'loving', 'just', 'was', 'cool', 'had', 'great', 'music', 'was', 'funny', 'independently', 'top', 'comedic', 'gems', 'rang', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'time', 'seemed', 'did', 'not', 'ace', 'SAT', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'world', 'was', 'seminal', 'period', 'movies', 'made', 'young', 'adults', 'did', 'not', 'pander', 'one', 'best.I', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'DVD', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'was', 'released', '22', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'happened', '2+', 'decades', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'released', 'today', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'smash', 'course', 'studio', 'unfortunately', 'would', 'force', 'director', 'go', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'thus', 'taking', 'away', 'great', 'deal', 'movie', 'best', 'moments', 'who', 'have', 'kids', 'not', 'movie', 'R', 'rating.In', 'nutshell', 'movie', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Joel', 'Goodsen', 'perfect', 'son', 'perfect', 'six', 'figure', 'earning', 'suburban', 'family', 'family', 'house', 'values', 'perfect', 'lawn', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'reviews', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'perfect', 'son', 'house', 'parents', 'are', 'town', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'have', 'experience', 'yourself.The', 'performances', 'are', 'perfect', 'board', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'became', 'megastar', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'had', 'started', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'madman', 'Oprah', 'movie', 'foundation', 'supported', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Morney', 'simply', 'amazing', 'script', 'direction', 'makers', 'captured', 'feel', 'Joel', 'world', 'Docksiders', 'Nikes', 'excitement', 'was', 'embarking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'quibble', 'when', 'movie', 'must', 'kids', 'did', 'look', 'little', 'long', 'tooth', 'yes', 'Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'could', 'imagine', 'Grease', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'rest', 'case.If', 'are', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'insightful', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'be', '17', '18', '1983', 'well', 'parents', 'had', 'bucks', 'would', 'be', 'riskless', 'choice', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'dislike', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'recent', 'years', 'can', 'say', 'biases', 'were', 'easily', 'put', 'aside', 'performance', 'put', 'touch', 'rising', 'star', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'here', 'Tom', 'looked', 'regular', 'guy', 'Ok', 'above-average', 'looks', 'who', 'audience', 'could', 'empathize', 'Easily', '5', 'stars', 'genre']",N/A

There's also the obligatory comment track by Cruise, the producer, etc.While clearly a reflection of the Reaganomics capitalistic mindset pervasive in the early '80's, this is a movie that, IMHO, will resonate with many generations, not just those Baby and post-Baby Boomers who saw this first run!

It just seemed to plod along at it's own pace and never really got going. At least for me. I've heard it compared to (better) films like most recently, The Girl Next Door.Tom Cruise didn't really convince that he was playing a teenager, and I can't figure out why either. The director tried to make him look more like a teenager, by making him work out 7 days a week in order to lose ten pounds. Once that had been accomplished, he immediately ceased working out and ate extremely fatty foods in order to add a layer of baby fat. This is how he achieved that ""fresh-faced"" teenage look. I'll agree that he did look fresh faced, but not enough to convince me. I just can't put my finger on it.I liked Rebecca De Mornay in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, and her practically brief appearance in Identity, but in this she was average.

Its all good fun until a chance meeting with a callgirl (De Mornay)  complicates Cruise's plans with a business offer of her own.  With the parents out of town for a weekend, Joel (Tom) takes the advice of one of his privileged pals (&#34;F____&#34; it, just do it man!), casts caution aside and goes out on a limb (actually SEVERAL limbs) and gets mixed up with a seedy pimp, a college recruiter and pretty much every teenage boy from his school.....Tom cemented his role as a tentative teen teetering on the edge of independence while trying to do the sensible thing; he is charming, vulnerable and endearing in his evolution into young adulthood.  Rebecca De Mornay is perfect as the fallen angel--sexy, sweet but driven in her ambitions.

Tom Cruise is an innocent teenager, who is forced by his friends to take advantage of his parents' absence from home & invites a call-girl over. What starts off as an interesting night for Cruise slowly turns into a nightmare. He runs his Dad's priceless Porsche into Lake Michigan by carelessness, gets suspended from college & gets very close to a real-life debt situation ! Rest of the film is seen Cruise straightening his life along with little or no help from his buddies. The film often highlites the phrase - What the heck ? Take some chances in life....Be a future enterpriser, signalling the need to use every given opportunity that life offers into a money making investment. Joe Pantoliano shines as Guido the killer pimp. Kurt Masur also excels as the bewildered school correspondent who comes to interview Cruise.

I had no idea what I was in for when I saw it during its theatrical run. One of my main objections is that the film minimizes, if not glamorizes, the impacts of prostitution. Prostitution is a very ugly, exploitative scene in real life, not the lighthearted fun that the film portrays. Not the best moral message, to be sure.Aside from that, the other problem I have is with the characters. EVERYONE is a jerk in this movie. Nobody is appealing or likeable. Not even Cruise's Joel, who I found to be as much of a self-centered @#$%&*/ as everyone else. Unfortunately, he followed up by playing the same kind of obnoxious characters (""Top Gun"", ""Days of Thunder""). It took ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Rain Man"" for me to gain any respect for him.Anyway, the combination of a creepy, amoral theme and obnoxious characters in what is supposed to be a comedy is a total turn-off.

Great music by Tangerine Dream (written especially for the movie) and strong performances from its young cast, most notably a nineteen year old Tom Cruise and twenty four year old Rebecca De Mornay.  (Small side note:  Cruise and De Mornay lived together for over two years after making the movie, so the chemistry on-screen must have been pretty real!)The original end of the movie was much darker than the happy, everything turns out okay version that was released.  Both versions were filmed and shown to a test audience, which preferred the happier, lighter version.  The original has (to my knowledge) never been released in any form, and I was concerned that it had been lost.I'm very happy to report that this 25th anniversary release is planned to include a new making-of documentary along with the alternate ending and commentary by Tom Cruise, director Paul Brickman, and producer Jon Avnet.So, it appears that this is what Risky Business fans have been waiting since 1983 to see!  The DVD is scheduled for release on September 16th, so we'll have to wait just a little longer.

Many times I saw this movie lying for rent in blockbuster, it had a catchy cover but the synopsis of the back cover never caught my attention. It wasn't until one of my friends gave away a whole bunch of 80's flicks and guess what? Risky business was there; so I went ahead and gave it a chance.For those who are unfamiliar with the story of the movie then don't worry it's quite simple. The movie's plot revolves around the character of Joel (played by Tom Cruise) who is the ideal  son; he gets good grades, perfect attendance, top of his class, and plus he is very obedient to his parents.....until.. Both of Joel's parents decide to take a trip out of town without Joel. They leave Joel the responsibility of the house, car etc. But when Joel's friends keep pushing him to take a chance at taking risks and having a good time Joel doesn't hesitate to think twice. So up to know everything  is fun and games....until.. Joel meets a young charming prostitute named Lana (played by Rebecca de Mornay) who teaches him how to have a good time. there's a lot more story in the picture that of course is not new, it has been seen and used in many  recent teen flicks, like The Girl Next Door, Orange County, American Pie. Actually the story of this movie is very similar to that of The Girl Next Door. for example; good boy gone bad, boy meets a hot girl which he thinks is out of his league, there's a pimp involved who control's the hot girl. All of these details are reminiscent in both flicksAs well the movie has some of the most memorable scenes, along with an awesome soundtrack from Tangerine Dream...

Not only is it a contemporary classic, but it was also Tom Cruise's breakthrough film and a major hit. While reputed to be a very good movie, upon watching it, I found it to be something else. It's an excellent movie.Tom Cruise plays Joel Goodson, a high-school kid who is just that - a good son. He's responsible, careful, and trusted. But when his parents leave town for the week, Joel decides to loosen up - but after he nervously invites call girl Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) into his house, everyone goes horridly wrong. With only a few days left to go, Joel must raise his grades, make $8,000, get back stolen furniture, and escape from the clutches of Guino (Joe Pontoliano), the killer pimp. Work is hell. And Joel knows it.This movie is great. It wildly exceeded by expectations, and is much better than it's said to be. Cruise is great - the fact that RISKY BUSINESS is Cruise's first major film is enough to make it worth the watch, anyway; De Mornay is also very good. Paul Brickman's direction has a sort of artistic feeling to it (he also scripted); he has a unique way of creating a film that's funny, erotic, and occasionally suspenseful.Another wonderful aspect of the film is its terrific soundtrack. It features rockin' songs from such popular artists as The Police, Bob Seger, Talking Heads, Muddy Waters, Phil Collins, and Prince. It also features new music by the hit-making band Tangerine Dream, whose techno, futuristic-sounding score gives the movie an occasionally nightmarish, occasionally unpleasant mood to it - and, of course, the film is about every teenager's nightmares come true.All in all, RISKY BUSINESS is essential viewing from the 1980's, and it works just as well now as it did then.
