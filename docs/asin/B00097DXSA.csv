902505,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00097DXSA,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 3]","This Danish movie starts with Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen), an owner of a bistro in Oslo, enjoying a happy life with the woman he loves, Maria (Lisa Werlinder), a young actress. Christoffer is the son of a Danish steel-owner; he left the family business because it gave nothing for his own life. When his father commits suicide, his mother (Ghita Norby) convinces him that he must return and take charge of the business, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. By the end of the movie he has made hard decisions, saved the company, engineered a merger and lost the woman he loves, whom he married, and their child. If one believes the thrust of the movie, he has lost his soul as well.This is an interesting film of how a man's character changes. It's a morose study of family obligations. The movie also, in my view, bites off more than it can chew thoroughly. Christoffer is shown as a man who, through obligation, loses the things that make him a human being. In fact, he seems to me to be a weak man, pushed into making big decisions and then anguishing over the impact those decisions have on people. Over time, he learns to make these decisions without the anguish. His mother, Maria, is shown to be a ruthless woman determined to impose her will on Christoffer in order to save the family business and maintain her idea of family obligations. From my perspective, she could be ruthless and manipulative, but she also was focused and strong-minded, with a clear idea of the tough decisions which had to be made. Christopher may have been manipulated by her, but he was manipulated because he was weak.Underlying all this is perhaps a too European attitude about the compromising choices business places on people. Like it or not, the decisions which had to be made to save the steel-making firm were fairly obvious ones. People had to be laid off, including some long-time employees. A disappointed brother-in-law, who was caught starting ruinous rumors about the firm when he was passed over, was fired. A merger was negotiated with a French steel firm in order to create the kind of scale that would allow effective competition with the Americans. The firm's finance manager, a long-time senior executive and friend of the family, was made to retire because the French firm also had a key finance manager and the merged firm didn't need two. These were all unpleasant decisions to make, and they also were reasonable decisions to make. The basic tone of the movie was a gloomy look at these decisions and their impact on changing Christoffer from a happy human being into a lonely, unhappy businessman who has lost most of the things that meant something to him.Ulrich Thomsen does an excellent job of portraying Christoffer, moving him from cheerful openness to anguish to a hard acceptance of his position. Equally good is Ghita Norby as his mother. She knows what has to be done, and she's prepared to do it.There are several extras, including a director's commentary and an interview with Per Fly on several aspects -- improvisation, camera work and so on -- of making the movie. Another actor was scheduled to play Christoffer, then the film was delayed and the actor had a conflicting film obligation. Thomsen came in six weeks before filming. To illustrate his points about rehearsal and improvisation, Fly shows several scenes of the two actors working in different ways. The DVD picture looks just fine and the subtitles are easy to read.",4,An Interesting But Somewhat Simplistic View Of Choices And Obligations,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,3452,"['Danish', 'movie', 'Christoffer', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'owner', 'bistro', 'Oslo', 'enjoying', 'happy', 'life', 'woman', 'Maria', 'Lisa', 'Werlinder', 'young', 'actress', 'Christoffer', 'son', 'Danish', 'steel-owner', 'left', 'family', 'business', 'gave', 'nothing', 'own', 'life', 'When', 'father', 'commits', 'suicide', 'mother', 'Ghita', 'Norby', 'must', 'return', 'take', 'charge', 'business', 'verge', 'bankruptcy', 'end', 'movie', 'made', 'hard', 'decisions', 'saved', 'company', 'engineered', 'merger', 'lost', 'woman', 'whom', 'married', 'child', 'one', 'thrust', 'movie', 'lost', 'soul', 'well.This', 'interesting', 'film', 'how', 'man', 'character', 'changes', 'morose', 'study', 'family', 'obligations', 'movie', 'also', 'view', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'thoroughly', 'Christoffer', 'shown', 'man', 'who', 'obligation', 'things', 'make', 'human', 'being', 'fact', 'be', 'weak', 'man', 'pushed', 'making', 'big', 'decisions', 'then', 'anguishing', 'impact', 'decisions', 'have', 'people', 'time', 'make', 'decisions', 'anguish', 'mother', 'Maria', 'shown', 'be', 'ruthless', 'woman', 'determined', 'impose', 'will', 'Christoffer', 'order', 'save', 'family', 'business', 'maintain', 'idea', 'family', 'obligations', 'perspective', 'could', 'be', 'ruthless', 'manipulative', 'also', 'was', 'focused', 'strong-minded', 'clear', 'idea', 'tough', 'decisions', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'Christopher', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'manipulated', 'was', 'manipulated', 'was', 'weak.Underlying', 'perhaps', 'too', 'European', 'attitude', 'compromising', 'choices', 'business', 'places', 'people', 'not', 'decisions', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'save', 'steel-making', 'firm', 'were', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'ones', 'People', 'had', 'be', 'laid', 'off', 'including', 'long-time', 'employees', 'disappointed', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'was', 'caught', 'starting', 'ruinous', 'rumors', 'firm', 'when', 'was', 'passed', 'was', 'fired', 'merger', 'was', 'negotiated', 'French', 'steel', 'firm', 'order', 'create', 'kind', 'scale', 'would', 'allow', 'effective', 'competition', 'Americans', 'firm', 'finance', 'manager', 'long-time', 'senior', 'executive', 'friend', 'family', 'was', 'made', 'retire', 'French', 'firm', 'also', 'had', 'key', 'finance', 'manager', 'merged', 'firm', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'two', 'were', 'unpleasant', 'decisions', 'make', 'also', 'were', 'reasonable', 'decisions', 'make', 'basic', 'tone', 'movie', 'was', 'gloomy', 'look', 'decisions', 'impact', 'changing', 'Christoffer', 'happy', 'human', 'being', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'businessman', 'who', 'lost', 'most', 'things', 'meant', 'something', 'him.Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Christoffer', 'moving', 'cheerful', 'openness', 'anguish', 'hard', 'acceptance', 'position', 'Equally', 'good', 'Ghita', 'Norby', 'mother', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'prepared', 'do', 'it.There', 'are', 'several', 'extras', 'including', 'director', 'commentary', 'interview', 'Per', 'Fly', 'several', 'aspects', 'improvisation', 'camera', 'work', 'so', 'making', 'movie', 'actor', 'was', 'scheduled', 'play', 'Christoffer', 'then', 'film', 'was', 'delayed', 'actor', 'had', 'conflicting', 'film', 'obligation', 'Thomsen', 'came', 'six', 'weeks', 'filming', 'illustrate', 'points', 'rehearsal', 'improvisation', 'Fly', 'several', 'scenes', 'two', 'actors', 'working', 'different', 'ways', 'DVD', 'picture', 'just', 'fine', 'subtitles', 'are', 'easy', 'read']",The Inheritance
902506,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00097DXSA,Grady Harp,"[6, 6]","Writer/director Per Fly is a strong filmmaker from Denmark who is unafraid to make controversial statements that challenge certain 'family values' sentiments prevalent in this country.  In this brilliantly written, directed and acted film he manages to reveal the inner destruction of a family under whose surface is an institution of envy.  It is a riveting film that despite its in excess of two-hour length keeps us riveted to our seats in its never-ending exploration of the darker side of familial machinations.Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen) has escaped his Danish family and is comfortably ensconced in Stockholm as a successful restaurateur, living with the beautiful actress Maria (Lisa Werlinder) whose love for life extends beyond the fulfilling pleasures of the boudoir. Their bliss is interrupted by an unexpected visit from Chrisoffer's father who briefly spends time with the couple, happy for their state of success in all things.  Upon his departure Christoffer receives a phone call that his father has hung himself and his presence is demanded in Denmark. Christoffer and Maria fly home to the matriarch of the family, Christoffer's mother Anneliese (the brilliant Ghita Norby) who immediately takes charge of the family, demands that Christoffer take over the failing family steel company thus skipping over Christoffer's designated brother-in-law Ulrick (Lars Brygmann), a fact that tears at Christoffer's sister Benedikte (Karina Skands). Taking the position of head of the family business would mean his giving up his dreams in Stockholm, negate Maria's burgeoning acting career, and placing Christoffer in the ominous position of having to fire longtime employees and make changes that would decimate many - not the least of which would be Christoffer's character.  But Anneliese is strong and gets her way and thus the destruction of Christoffer's humanity and life begins.Christoffer is able to merge the company with a French company and make the family business successful.  But at what a cost?  Maria leaves him after they have a child, Benedikte collides with him over his ruining her life with Ulrick, and Christoffer moves to France where he drowns his sorrows in alcohol.  Per Fly is not one to tidy up all of the loose ends of a family disintegration: he leaves the end results of a bad decision up to the audience to figure out.  It is this respect for the audience that endears this artist to us.  The script is brilliantly written, the acting is superb, and the direction is tight and sensitive to the storyline.  In every way this is a film worthy of our attention, not only as an art piece, but also as a means of re-examining 'family values' that here are presented in quite a different light than our usual reference phrase suggests.

In the light of this Per Fly has directed a powerful drama with a contemporary Shakespearian tone, maybe Hamlet, where the theme brings along several intricate side plots that will influence the audience in several ways.  The film opens with Danish businessman Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen), who many will recognize from Celebration (1998), arriving to Stockholm where he is supposed to have a meeting, which unfortunately has been cancelled.  Instead of returning home he wanders the streets of the Swedish capital, as if he lived there.  Then he sits down in front of a fountain gazing up at a window where a woman closes a window, as the story flashes back five years.In the nearby country of Sweden Christoffer has sought a personal refuge from family and family company.  He has succeed in establishing himself in the competitive Stockholm restaurant market and he is about to diversify himself through his profits in another restaurant.  Everything seems to fall in place for him, as his love life with Maria (Lisa Werlinder )is even growing stronger than his professional life.  Maria's career is also blooming, as she reveals that she has been offered an annual contract with the Royal Theater in Stockholm, including a part as Juliet in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  It seems as if nothing in the world could touch their happiness.  When Christoffer's father, Aksel (Ulf Pilgaard) arrives unannounced he is ecstatic to share with him about their happiness and success.  However, this unbreakable bubble of joy slowly begins to fade away when Christoffer finds out that his father has hanged himself shortly after his visit.The news of his father's death forces him to leave Stockholm at once in order to arrange the funeral and all of the details around the family business.  Here the audience could possibly recognize the parallel to Hamlet.  When Christoffer arrives his mother quickly informs him that he is needed in Denmark, and that he is to take over the family steel company.  It also seems that Aksel hid a large negative balance and the banks are getting restless with his death.  Amidst the family crisis the company also faces dark financial times that will force them to lay off at least hundred employees and find a company to merge with in order to maintain strong on the highly competitive steel market.  Christoffer also has to take into account that Maria has a life in Stockholm with a thriving career and he has taken the position that was understood that his brother-in-law, Ulrik (Lars Brygmann) should have.  Whatever Christoffer's decision is it will hurt someone, as he finds himself in a troubling crossroads of his life where his decision will make strong ripples throughout his life and those near to him.The fascination with the story rests within Christoffer's choice and how he tries to keep things together while slowly drifting into a personally miserably state.  Fly creates an atmosphere where the protagonist is selfish and unselfish at the same time, as he drifts into a cerebral confusion where he wanders aimlessly in order to please them all.  In the process of helping others, he gets himself lost where his misery induces a more depressive tone to his life, which he begins to accept.  All of this is possible through a brilliant performance from an outstanding and a rather unknown cast on this side of the Atlantic.  In addition, Fly illustrates his eye for details, as the mise-en-scene embraces the characters in a pragmatic, yet artistic manner where everything that needs to be framed within the shot exists.  Cumulatively, those who find themselves engrossed in this poignant drama will discover Christoffer's transformation radiantly tragic, as the human drama reaches its pinnacle.",5,Powerful Drama with a Contemporary Shakespearian Tone...,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,3864,"['Choices', 'life', 'often', 'make', 'person', 'choose', 'direction', 'will', 'affect', 'own', 'people', 'dear', 'light', 'Per', 'Fly', 'directed', 'powerful', 'drama', 'contemporary', 'Shakespearian', 'tone', 'maybe', 'Hamlet', 'where', 'theme', 'several', 'intricate', 'side', 'plots', 'will', 'influence', 'audience', 'several', 'ways', 'film', 'Danish', 'businessman', 'Christoffer', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'who', 'many', 'will', 'recognize', 'Celebration', '1998', 'arriving', 'Stockholm', 'where', 'supposed', 'have', 'meeting', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'cancelled', 'Instead', 'returning', 'home', 'streets', 'Swedish', 'capital', 'lived', 'there', 'Then', 'down', 'front', 'fountain', 'gazing', 'up', 'window', 'where', 'woman', 'window', 'story', 'back', 'five', 'years.In', 'nearby', 'country', 'Sweden', 'Christoffer', 'sought', 'personal', 'refuge', 'family', 'family', 'company', 'succeed', 'establishing', 'competitive', 'Stockholm', 'restaurant', 'market', 'diversify', 'profits', 'restaurant', 'Everything', 'fall', 'place', 'love', 'life', 'Maria', 'Lisa', 'Werlinder', 'even', 'growing', 'stronger', 'professional', 'life', 'Maria', 'career', 'also', 'blooming', 'been', 'offered', 'annual', 'contract', 'Royal', 'Theater', 'Stockholm', 'including', 'part', 'Juliet', 'Shakespeare', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'nothing', 'world', 'could', 'touch', 'happiness', 'When', 'Christoffer', 'father', 'Aksel', 'Ulf', 'Pilgaard', 'unannounced', 'ecstatic', 'share', 'happiness', 'success', 'However', 'unbreakable', 'bubble', 'joy', 'slowly', 'fade', 'away', 'when', 'Christoffer', 'out', 'father', 'hanged', 'shortly', 'visit.The', 'news', 'father', 'death', 'forces', 'leave', 'Stockholm', 'once', 'order', 'arrange', 'funeral', 'details', 'family', 'business', 'Here', 'audience', 'could', 'possibly', 'recognize', 'parallel', 'Hamlet', 'When', 'Christoffer', 'mother', 'quickly', 'needed', 'Denmark', 'take', 'over', 'family', 'steel', 'company', 'also', 'Aksel', 'hid', 'large', 'negative', 'balance', 'banks', 'are', 'getting', 'restless', 'death', 'family', 'crisis', 'company', 'also', 'dark', 'financial', 'times', 'will', 'force', 'lay', 'off', 'least', 'hundred', 'employees', 'find', 'company', 'merge', 'order', 'maintain', 'strong', 'highly', 'competitive', 'steel', 'market', 'Christoffer', 'also', 'take', 'account', 'Maria', 'life', 'Stockholm', 'thriving', 'career', 'taken', 'position', 'was', 'understood', 'brother-in-law', 'Ulrik', 'Lars', 'Brygmann', 'should', 'have', 'Christoffer', 'decision', 'will', 'hurt', 'someone', 'troubling', 'crossroads', 'life', 'where', 'decision', 'will', 'make', 'strong', 'ripples', 'life', 'him.The', 'fascination', 'story', 'rests', 'Christoffer', 'choice', 'how', 'keep', 'things', 'together', 'slowly', 'drifting', 'personally', 'miserably', 'state', 'Fly', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'protagonist', 'selfish', 'unselfish', 'same', 'time', 'cerebral', 'confusion', 'where', 'aimlessly', 'order', 'please', 'process', 'helping', 'others', 'lost', 'where', 'misery', 'more', 'depressive', 'tone', 'life', 'accept', 'possible', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'rather', 'unknown', 'cast', 'side', 'Atlantic', 'addition', 'Fly', 'eye', 'details', 'mise-en-scene', 'characters', 'pragmatic', 'yet', 'artistic', 'manner', 'where', 'everything', 'be', 'framed', 'shot', 'Cumulatively', 'who', 'find', 'engrossed', 'poignant', 'drama', 'will', 'discover', 'Christoffer', 'transformation', 'radiantly', 'tragic', 'human', 'drama', 'pinnacle']",The Inheritance

Didn't know too much about it going in, other than what I read on the DVD jacket, so I took a flyer on this.""The Inheritance"" (2003 release from Denmark; 115 min.) brings the story of Christoffer (played by Ulrich Thomsen), who years ago left his family's business (a steel factory) back in Denmark and now lives happily in Stockholm with his beautifil Swedish wife Maria (played by Lisa Werlinder). When Christoffer's dad commits suicide, Christopher's mom begs, manipulates and cajoles Christoffer to return to Denmark and succeed his dad as head of the company, and against the wishes of Maria, Chrisoffer finally does. As soon as Christoffer takes over, he gets confronted with insider backstabbing, board room drama, and financial pressure from the banks, all the while trying to keep Maria in line and happy. Will Christoffer succeed in saving the family business? Will Maria stay with Christoffer? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: the movie starts rather slow and in the first half hour feels more like a soap than a corporate board room/family drama.

It is profound because it makes you think about the choices you make in life and how each choice leads you to a different destiny.""The Inheritance"" follows the life and choices of Christoffer, a young Danish entrepreneur who has successfully opened a thriving restaurant in Stockholm.  He is blissfully happy and deeply in love with his stunning actress wife, Maria.  His business is flourishing, his wife's career is receiving recognition and offers, and he seems to have everything anyone could want.  Then he receives a call that his steel magnate father has committed suicide, the family business is about to fail, and he is asked to return to Denmark, save it, and take control.Christoffer fled Denmark some years earlier when he resigned from a disastrous career in that same family company.  Where do his loyalties lie--to his wife and their happy arrangement in Stockholm, or to the hundreds of employees and family members dependent on his business acumen in Denmark?  Can he make that life work?  Should he just stay in Stockholm?It is a story beautifully portrayed that touches one's inner core, a theme that is timeless and universal.",5,"Timeless, Universal and Touching",1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,1208,"['one', 'profound', 'films', 'based', 'simple', 'story', 'profound', 'think', 'choices', 'make', 'life', 'how', 'choice', 'different', 'destiny', 'Inheritance', 'life', 'choices', 'Christoffer', 'young', 'Danish', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'successfully', 'opened', 'thriving', 'restaurant', 'Stockholm', 'blissfully', 'happy', 'deeply', 'love', 'stunning', 'actress', 'wife', 'Maria', 'business', 'flourishing', 'wife', 'career', 'receiving', 'recognition', 'offers', 'have', 'everything', 'anyone', 'could', 'want', 'Then', 'call', 'steel', 'magnate', 'father', 'committed', 'suicide', 'family', 'business', 'fail', 'asked', 'return', 'Denmark', 'save', 'take', 'control.Christoffer', 'fled', 'Denmark', 'years', 'earlier', 'when', 'resigned', 'disastrous', 'career', 'same', 'family', 'company', 'Where', 'do', 'loyalties', 'lie', 'wife', 'happy', 'arrangement', 'Stockholm', 'hundreds', 'employees', 'family', 'members', 'dependent', 'business', 'acumen', 'Denmark', 'Can', 'make', 'life', 'work', 'Should', 'just', 'stay', 'Stockholm', 'story', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'one', 'inner', 'core', 'theme', 'timeless', 'universal']",The Inheritance
