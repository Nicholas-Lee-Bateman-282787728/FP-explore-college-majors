How do we know some kid doesnt go to a junkyard, buy a $100 piece of crap, makes a video, and get it remade on this show? Xzbit is just anther rapper who doesnt make it in the buisness, thanks to it being over crowded with lesser talent. Its kind of stupid to think, the car just sitting alone in the drive way, a camera crew on a street that is not busy, surrounded by houses, no one around, as Xzbit looks at your car. Where is the person? standing in there house? The show is preplanned, and the  reactions are just faked abit. I know im over doing this, but if you had your car pimped like they do- think of how much it would cost to insure the car.

Some of what they do with the cars is amazing...but I wonder why they don't just get better cars to work with.  If you rebuild an old piece of junk, you could get problems down the road.

881564,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B0007KIFKU,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[14, 15]","I disagree with Amazon's reviewer, this might be your mothers TV show too. My wife and I stumbled on this series one weekend last year. We were impressed how this hardcore looking rapper Xzibit chose people who didn't have the means to fix up there cars to pimp. After watching a couple episodes on TV I was hooked. The people they helped seemed like good people that deserved a break. I couldn't believe the transformation of these cars from mostly wrecks to major eye catching street machines. Now let me first point out that my wife and I are in our fifties and neither of us are fans of rap. It was Xzibits hysterical warm personality, the West Coast Customs unusual and funny crew, and the premise of what MTV and West Coast Customs were trying to accomplish that got our attention and kept it. Sure this is a TV show, but you can't help thinking they really are trying to do somehthing nice. I have even considered buying one of Xzibits CDs.Does this show give Xzibit, MTV, and West Coast Customs good PR? You bet, but it goes a bit further. For example when one kids car was so bad off it was unsafe to pimp, they didn't say sorry we can't help you out, they bought him a new car and pimped it out. Perhaps this is all just an attempt for ratings, but a part of me wants to think they are really having fun and they enjoy helping people in the process. This first season set comes in a small neon green case and the DVDs are in very slender cases. Several extras, most which are fun to watch except for the one deleted scene of the car being driven around without doors for what seemed forever. I recommend this set to anyone young or old with an interest in cars. That or anyone it warms to see some broke student get their car customized to the tune of about $20,000 and not cost them a dime.Now if we can just get them to do a spin-off where they pimp the rides of middle-class to upper income families on the East coast. I think they should call it ""Pimp My Ride Too"" or ""Pimp My Parent"". I realize my wife and I have good incomes in the computer and pharmacy industry, but we do help others and I'm sure our friends and children would tell you we are nice people. If you want to widen the audience base, you need to widen your demographics and selection of rides to pimp. I have a 2002 Grand Prix GTP that is in good shape so it shouldn't be as hard to fix up.

881565,A24453RLGFSSUO,B0007KIFKU,Diablo Sv666,"[4, 14]","Pimp My Ride in a nutshell: If you were to watch MTV'S Pimp My Ride, then don't. By now since you know the show, you should also know every weird aspect of it. You know what I'm talking about; you know who you are reading this review.Let's start of with the observations:1.Are people purposely acting as if thier cars are really busted up to get them hooked up in return? I've seen cars that would never pass inspections. Yet they drive it around to hang out, go to work etc etc? People holding doors on with rope as well as bumpers; some peope dont even have keys and can still cut the car on. There is way too much stuff wrong with these automobiles that they wouldnt be driven on the road let alone pass inspections. How do they drive these cars, trucks around without valid stickers?One show that is going to come on that focuses on a guy's bumper ain't even on, exposing most of the cars insides. The bumpers is in the back seat. Let's be real here: did you know that it is an offence to drive these kind of dumpy cars on the road without a bumper? It can lead to the fuzz giving you a crazy amount of tickets!2.Notice how every time the show starts up? You get this: person shows damaged car; next the ranter says blah blah: [[""hole leaks in car..please MTV, pimp my ride!""]]. Now, this is easy to explain and understand. When X-Zibit shows up, he always does his pose into the scene, (note that nobody is looking in the scene outside, being in the scene or even watching it) and later checks the car and gets enjoyment of mocking the downsides of it. At the moment X-Zibit comes to the person's door, the person ALWAYS greets X-Zibit with excitement followed by hugging the guy. Now to put it simple:1. The person is always home2. The person always answers the door3. The car is always out front, never in a garage4. They all happen to know X-Zibit.Then X-Zibit acts as if he's going to drive that pile of junk to West Coast Customs. Until at the part-end of the show, the camera is outside / inside (correct me if I'm wrong) and X-Zibit waits to reveal his / her's ""pimped"" ride. ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS you'll see the person be amazed about it. No complaints about the car what-so-ever. It has come to the conclusion that basically most of the scenes has been obviously set up. In other words it's scripted.3.West Coast Customs attempts to put on unnecessary accessories in the person's car. Since when would I want a TV in the car when I'm not going to use it?  They do the stupidest modifications. Oh lets put this contraption on that doesn't actually work. Or maybe put a flat screen in your trunk so you'll never use it. Or maybe put a hood scoop on your hood, but not make it go anywhere. Or how about giving a bad ""three"" in lift. Or how about making up some dumb name for a paint job: ""Dog, dat Burppple"" Bloody hell. Its not the mechanics fault, but MTV bosses them to. Why don't they ever touch the engine? There you go: it's scripted.I think you get the point that I urge that you must never watch Pimp My Ride again. Sure, they customize their cars but can't be bothered to show what's right for them. How about get your lazy buttock up and pimp one yourself? I mean, sure there's no restrictions. Pimp My Ride is anything but that...

The three disc set includes all of the episodes from the first season of the surprise MTV hit series which stars rapper Xzibit. The box set comes in a bright neon green box, as seen above. The individual discs are enclosed in their own plastic keepsake cases. There are a total of 15 pimped out rides included in the box set and a nice selection of special features. It's not hard to forget the very first episode of Pimp My Ride, Wyatts 1988 Daihatsu Hi-Jet. Not only were Wyatt and Xzibit from two totally different worlds it seemed, X and the crew at West Coast Customs totally pimped the Hi-Jet.The episodes themselves are pretty much the same. Xzibit suprises a young Southern California male or female who appears to be under twenty five years old and attempts to drive their raggedy car to West Coast Customs. Next we see the staff of West Coast Customs sit down in a meeting (a rep from the company said in FHM magazine that the meeting is strictly for the camera), and they determine just what tricked out things they are going to do to the car. So essentially, it is a total car makeover with special additions like shoe racks, e-mail hook-ups, video game systems, camera, video moniters and other hi tech additions.The special features are interesting for the Pimp My Ride fan. Disc three includes the special features, which are as follows:-Deleted scenes (not too much here, just a few little out takes that include Xzibit and the staff of West Coast Customs clowning around)-Bloopers -The staff of West Coast Customs and the kids who have their rides pimped flub on lines.-Exclusive car Tour featuring Travis Barker (Blink 182) and his 1954 Cadilac Coup DeVille- (this is a nice little featurette. Travis and all of his tattoos explain to Xzibit just what he did to make his Caddy look nice and smooth, down to the two tone paint.-What We Drive featurette-We see Q's motorcycle, Gary's hot BMW and Mikes motor home or some kind of live in coach home that is circa 1978.-Xzibit Music Video-""What You See It What You Get.""Pimp My Ride season one is a great purchase for someone who loves the shows, like Xzibit or for the car fan.

""Hi, it's me, wanna come lay underneath my car and watch a movie with me?"" and you'd have to lay in your garage to be safe, `cause if you did it out on the street and a car crashes in to you or doesn't see you and runs your feet over or anything, well, that would lead into a nice spin off called, ""pimp my wheelchair"".

He must watch a lot of TV, since he compares the formerly busted up cars to some characters on some shows.  The young drivers are well deserving despite their difficulties with their transportation.  Most of these cars would be sitting in the junkyards by now, but the West Coast Customs people do a superb job updating the cars, giving them clean looks without being too showy or flashy. The body work is jaw dropping, the interiors are fabulous, the tires are neat and they did the cars to match the drivers' favorite hobbies. Plus they put some sharp state-of-the-art electronics and sound systems in the cars, as well as Playstations, small TVs, computers and video games in some. (But that's when they're off the road--they should focus on DRIVING first, please!)  This is a better alternative to the overdone home improvement, cleaning-up-some-nasty-rooms trend going on now, ala Trading Spaces and Extreme Makeover Home Edition.  But here's the hard part--can these drivers keep their rides and whips up?  What about one year. 5 or 10 years from now? They need to keep them neat and clean while they're hot for the moment. The girl with the grandmother had me laughing, but she was charming.  The funniest was Neil and that silly Luv Bug which wouldn't get on any auto trade show today! I loved how they updated that Cadillac. The girl with the Mustang had some beautiful gold colored seats!  And Ezra's Nissan took it out of its former soccer mom, lost identity mode. Most moving, the girl who overcame a drug problem and is sober now, yet now has a pimped out, cleaned up car. The message here on this show is, let a body shop or custom shop update your run down or outdated car or truck.  Don't try to fix it yourself, as some of these people attempted to do. What's surprising are that the shows are 19 to 20(!) minutes. And we had to endure through 5 minutes of commercials or so that MTV likes to do. In a time when MTV is showing lesser videos than in the '80s, this is one of their better shows, the best since 1998's FANatic. Liked the funky hip-hop theme song and the filming and graphics are very good. To Xzibit, one of my favorite rappers and to West Coast Customs, thanks for pimping these people's rides!!!!!!!!!!!!",4,Very good shows; liked how they updated the cars to today!,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,2353,"['am', 'already', '12th', 'show', 'Pimp', 'My', 'Ride', 'MTV', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'Xzibit', 'strong', 'host', 'show', 'must', 'watch', 'lot', 'TV', 'formerly', 'busted', 'up', 'cars', 'characters', 'shows', 'young', 'drivers', 'are', 'well', 'deserving', 'difficulties', 'transportation', 'Most', 'cars', 'would', 'be', 'sitting', 'junkyards', 'now', 'West', 'Coast', 'Customs', 'people', 'do', 'superb', 'job', 'updating', 'cars', 'giving', 'clean', 'looks', 'being', 'too', 'showy', 'flashy', 'body', 'work', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'interiors', 'are', 'fabulous', 'tires', 'are', 'neat', 'did', 'cars', 'match', 'drivers', 'favorite', 'hobbies', 'put', 'sharp', 'state-of-the-art', 'electronics', 'sound', 'systems', 'cars', 'as', 'well', 'Playstations', 'small', 'TVs', 'computers', 'video', 'games', 'when', ""'re"", 'road', 'should', 'focus', 'DRIVING', 'first', 'please', 'better', 'alternative', 'overdone', 'home', 'improvement', 'cleaning-up-some-nasty-rooms', 'trend', 'going', 'now', 'ala', 'Trading', 'Spaces', 'Extreme', 'Makeover', 'Home', 'Edition', 'here', 'hard', 'part', 'can', 'drivers', 'keep', 'rides', 'up', 'What', 'one', 'year', '5', '10', 'years', 'now', 'need', 'keep', 'neat', 'clean', ""'re"", 'hot', 'moment', 'girl', 'grandmother', 'had', 'laughing', 'was', 'charming', 'funniest', 'was', 'Neil', 'silly', 'Luv', 'Bug', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'auto', 'trade', 'show', 'today', 'loved', 'how', 'updated', 'Cadillac', 'girl', 'Mustang', 'had', 'beautiful', 'gold', 'colored', 'seats', 'Ezra', 'Nissan', 'took', 'former', 'soccer', 'mom', 'lost', 'identity', 'mode', 'Most', 'moving', 'girl', 'who', 'drug', 'problem', 'sober', 'now', 'yet', 'now', 'pimped', 'out', 'cleaned', 'up', 'car', 'message', 'here', 'show', 'let', 'body', 'shop', 'custom', 'shop', 'update', 'run', 'down', 'outdated', 'car', 'truck', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'fix', 'people', 'attempted', 'do', 'What', 'surprising', 'are', 'shows', 'are', '19', '20', 'minutes', 'had', 'endure', '5', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'so', 'MTV', 'likes', 'do', 'time', 'when', 'MTV', 'showing', 'lesser', 'videos', ""'80s"", 'one', 'better', 'shows', 'best', '1998', 'FANatic', 'Liked', 'funky', 'hip-hop', 'theme', 'song', 'filming', 'graphics', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Xzibit', 'one', 'favorite', 'rappers', 'West', 'Coast', 'Customs', 'thanks', 'pimping', 'people', 'rides']",N/A
881570,AAJGG0PD8C7GU,B0007KIFKU,"Rich King's Breakfast Nook ""Gretna is a great...","[6, 25]","This show kind of gets on my nerves because first of all I think Mtv is the worst channel on TV now. Second, I think it's unfair that if you're a burn out in California that can't take care of your car Mtv comes and fixes up your car for free. If these kids had some real gumption like I do, they pimp their own rides like the Nook did. I already had a really cool car by driving my 1984 Renault Alliance with a leather top but I figured as pimp as I am I needed to upgrade. Boy did I! I pimped my own ride. I took the top off the Renault and put redid it but gave myself six more feet of headroom. It looked like a little condo on wheels. I then put a 42"" inch flat screen tv behind the driver's seat with Sanyo surround sound. It plays nothing but porn. Some would say it leaves only 4 inches of seating room in the back, but the fact it's porn makes it totally worth it. There was no room for speakers so those are mounted on the side of the car facing into the back seat. I also put an atari 2600 with purple joysticks. You roll with Combat or Missile command, it doesn't get more pimp than that. I put John Deere combine tires with 58"" platinum rims. I rollin dawg. You think I'm done? Nope, I also installed a weber grill under the hood that cooks steaks while you drive. I installed a system with a tv camers under the hood that lets you check on your steaks. If they're done I installed a conveyor system under the car that puts the steaks in the trunk where I have robotic arms that put A-1 on your steak and a buttered baked potato. After that, Trastor the robot emerges from your truck with your meal and comes in through the special trap door in the ceiling to serve you your dinner. My radio is wired with a computerized knife and fork that feed you while you drive. Does it get more pimp than steak and porn? I think not.",2,"Big deal, my ride is already pimped",1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,1835,"['show', 'kind', 'nerves', 'first', 'think', 'Mtv', 'worst', 'channel', 'TV', 'now', 'Second', 'think', 'unfair', ""'re"", 'burn', 'out', 'California', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'car', 'Mtv', 'fixes', 'up', 'car', 'free', 'kids', 'had', 'real', 'gumption', 'do', 'pimp', 'own', 'rides', 'Nook', 'did', 'already', 'had', 'really', 'cool', 'car', 'driving', '1984', 'Renault', 'Alliance', 'leather', 'top', 'figured', 'as', 'pimp', 'am', 'needed', 'upgrade', 'Boy', 'did', 'pimped', 'own', 'ride', 'took', 'top', 'Renault', 'put', 'redid', 'gave', 'six', 'more', 'feet', 'headroom', 'looked', 'little', 'condo', 'wheels', 'then', 'put', '42', 'inch', 'flat', 'screen', 'tv', 'driver', 'seat', 'Sanyo', 'surround', 'sound', 'nothing', 'porn', 'would', 'say', 'only', '4', 'inches', 'seating', 'room', 'back', 'fact', 'porn', 'totally', 'was', 'room', 'speakers', 'so', 'are', 'mounted', 'side', 'car', 'facing', 'back', 'seat', 'also', 'put', 'atari', '2600', 'purple', 'joysticks', 'roll', 'Combat', 'Missile', 'command', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'pimp', 'put', 'John', 'Deere', 'combine', 'tires', '58', 'platinum', 'rims', 'rollin', 'dawg', 'think', ""'m"", 'done', 'Nope', 'also', 'installed', 'weber', 'grill', 'hood', 'steaks', 'drive', 'installed', 'system', 'tv', 'camers', 'hood', 'check', 'steaks', ""'re"", 'done', 'installed', 'conveyor', 'system', 'car', 'steaks', 'trunk', 'where', 'have', 'robotic', 'arms', 'put', 'A-1', 'steak', 'buttered', 'baked', 'potato', 'Trastor', 'robot', 'truck', 'meal', 'special', 'trap', 'door', 'ceiling', 'serve', 'dinner', 'radio', 'wired', 'computerized', 'knife', 'fork', 'feed', 'drive', 'get', 'more', 'pimp', 'steak', 'porn', 'think', 'not']",N/A

I don't like the series enough to want to purchase the season set, but it was interesting to see a hooptie transformed into a much improved appearing car.  Xzibit is a good host for the show.  He is quite funny and being a hip hop artist, a lot of people are familiar and comfortable with him.  The basis of the show is people pretty much beg for their cars to be fixed up.  These cars may have mismatched paint, no seats, one car was held together by glue and gum!!!!  Cars held together by duct tape.  Key broken into the ignition, driver side window does not work, cars so dirty looks like years of grit on it. Alarm goes off if you so much as sneeze on one car. One car broke down just short of getting to WCC.  Now that was hilarious.  They had to push the car into the lot.These cars are in really horrible shape. Xzibit surprises the person, and takes their car to West Coast Customs, and you hear what their plans are for the car.  After the men of WCC discuss what their plans are, you see the magic being done.  Sometimes they run into problems, but they always work things out to finish the task at hand.  I also have to add the workers reaction when they first see the car enter the lot is comical as well.  Xzibit makes jokes while driving some of the cars, because they are that bad.A lot of the clients are young college students, or getting first jobs, or helping relatives and need reliable transportation.Some cars get as much as $20,000 worth of work on it!!  Rims, new tires, an awesome audio system.  A fabulous paint job.  The best part of the show is seeing the person results when they see their car again for the first time.  Chrstine's reacting was so intense she made me cry.  Some folks are brought to tears when they see what their car looks like.  I also liked how they really tried to learn about the person driving the car and would make sure to incorporate the person's individual personality into the ride.I will admit I thought it a little excessive to put xbox's, fish tanks, chandelier's, espresso machines into the car.  My favorite segment was when Xzibit got one person whose Escort was not safe to drive a new Scion, and they hooked up the Scion.  I thought that was wonderful. The custom paint jobs were really nice as well.  Raspberry Pearl, two tone yellow and black, cinnamon pearl paint jobs to name a few.  The series is on 3 Disc and you get some extras too.  Some worth watching, others you can skip I felt.All in all it's a fun show to watch, but I would not buy the series.  This is the type of series you will watch once, maybe twice, but it's not the type of show I would find myself having the urge to watch over and over again.

It is great fun, packed with surprises, always outrageous, and full of good-feelings for helping the needy without condensation.  Xzibit is a fantastic host, charasmatic and witty.

Quick and stylish interface.  Three disks in three thin clear cases, which I really like.But I have to downgrade the score because MTV decided to front-load the disks with almost 10 minutes of *non-skippable* ads for their other lame shows.
