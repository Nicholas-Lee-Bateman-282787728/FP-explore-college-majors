1426283,A17S1450Y06C86,B004R8HRWU,Aidan J. McQuade,"[9, 9]","A deeply moving, beautifully acted drama that tries with some success to explore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in all its complexity. This complexity is echoed in the narrative structure of the drama which in one strand follows the experiences of Len, an army sergeant in the British Forces in Palestine after the Second World War, and in a second strand follows his granddaughter Erin as she tries to make sense of present day Israel and Palestine during a summer visit. As always the seeds of the present lie in the past as Len witnesses the bloody birth of the state of Israel.Ultimately ""The Promise"" is strident in its dissatisfaction with contemporary Israeli policy towards Palestinans which it portrays as implicitly racist. However it strives for completeness and honesty showing the slaughter from Palestinian suicide bombing, along with Israeli landgrabs, and, most disturbingly, the naked prejudice and extremism of the Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, something that is given de-facto official sanction by their protection by the Israeli armed forces.Probably most unsettling to unthinking supporters of Israel is that the drama makes a direct attack on the myth of Israeli ""purity of arms"": the 1948 Irgun war crime of Der Yassin is depicted and the cruelty of the ethnic cleansing of that period is shown, foreshadowing today's ongoing land grabs and the repression now inflicted, on Hebron and Gaza amongst other places, in support of this policy. Some may feel the portrayal of a only a single British sergeant trying to stop the killing at Der Yassin is unfair as there are reports of Israeli Hagannah officers also trying unsuccessfully to intervene. However the drama is careful in representing this strand of Israeli politics with the depiction of Paul, an Israeli member of Combatants for Peace, and his father, a politically liberal general.Overall the film conveys the tragedy that two beautiful peoples cannot yet find a way to share their beautiful land, resulting in the ugly manifestation of each using terrorism on the other in increasingly brutal cycles.",5,"Complex, unsettling, brilliant drama",1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,2099,"['deeply', 'moving', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'drama', 'success', 'explore', 'Israeli-Palestinian', 'conflict', 'complexity', 'complexity', 'echoed', 'narrative', 'structure', 'drama', 'one', 'strand', 'experiences', 'Len', 'army', 'sergeant', 'British', 'Forces', 'Palestine', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'second', 'strand', 'granddaughter', 'Erin', 'make', 'sense', 'present', 'day', 'Israel', 'Palestine', 'summer', 'visit', 'always', 'seeds', 'present', 'lie', 'past', 'Len', 'bloody', 'birth', 'state', 'Israel.Ultimately', 'Promise', 'strident', 'dissatisfaction', 'contemporary', 'Israeli', 'policy', 'towards', 'Palestinans', 'as', 'implicitly', 'racist', 'However', 'completeness', 'honesty', 'showing', 'slaughter', 'Palestinian', 'suicide', 'bombing', 'Israeli', 'landgrabs', 'most', 'disturbingly', 'naked', 'prejudice', 'extremism', 'Jewish', 'settlers', 'occupied', 'territories', 'something', 'given', 'de-facto', 'official', 'sanction', 'protection', 'Israeli', 'armed', 'forces.Probably', 'most', 'unsettling', 'unthinking', 'supporters', 'Israel', 'drama', 'direct', 'attack', 'myth', 'Israeli', 'purity', 'arms', '1948', 'Irgun', 'war', 'crime', 'Der', 'Yassin', 'depicted', 'cruelty', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'period', 'shown', 'foreshadowing', 'today', 'ongoing', 'land', 'grabs', 'repression', 'now', 'inflicted', 'Hebron', 'Gaza', 'amongst', 'other', 'places', 'support', 'policy', 'may', 'feel', 'portrayal', 'only', 'single', 'British', 'sergeant', 'trying', 'stop', 'killing', 'Der', 'Yassin', 'unfair', 'are', 'reports', 'Israeli', 'Hagannah', 'officers', 'also', 'trying', 'unsuccessfully', 'intervene', 'However', 'drama', 'careful', 'representing', 'strand', 'Israeli', 'politics', 'depiction', 'Paul', 'Israeli', 'member', 'Combatants', 'Peace', 'father', 'politically', 'liberal', 'film', 'conveys', 'tragedy', 'two', 'beautiful', 'peoples', 'can', 'not', 'yet', 'find', 'way', 'share', 'beautiful', 'land', 'resulting', 'ugly', 'manifestation', 'using', 'terrorism', 'other', 'increasingly', 'brutal', 'cycles']",N/A
