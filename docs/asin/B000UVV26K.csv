At the very least, there is Heather Graham, who can light up any production like a beautiful Japanese lantern of intelligent sexuality. Well, this was something unexpected and wonderful, a lovingly orchestrated allegorical psychodrama about addiction but also about the very nature of the state of bondage that life often seems to be. Bondage to lust, avarice, gluttony...you get the idea. You really must see this!

The most obvious thing is that, the woman who stars in the movie works night shift in a cafe serving coffee to people, gets to communicate with a variety of people on a very strange night where everything seems to fall into place for the woman, and talking to her customers leads the woman to experience a little bit more of the world and the variety of people that seem to encourage her to make something of her life and to get away from the place she works.She meets a boyfriend... at some point.... and at the end of the movie, where the storyline goes in a COMPLETELY different direction than I was expecting, her boyfriend (or rather, ex-boyfriend) returns to the cafe for a grand finale.I did really love the movie, and even though I feel uncomfortable giving it 5 stars because I wasn't quite sure what was going on most of the time, I was *entertained* by it, and that's the point.  You see, every time you think you know where the story is going, the plot suddenly jumps away from the main subject and flashbacks into the girls troubled past.There IS a message though (an important message) and that's, don't waste your life away doing something boring if you have the talent to succeed in other areas, because there's no point being held back by anything.As for the variety of colorful characters the woman communicates with in the cafe... I loved them.  Lots of variety which leads to plenty of unexpected conversations and plot twists that entertain and amaze the viewer.

1096924,A3M1EKSN23SVOJ,B000UVV26K,"DICK YORK IS THE BETTER DICK ""Sterculeus Erectus""","[2, 4]","There's a LOT going on in this film. IGNORE the Mainstream critics who seem to have all given this film ONE or one and a half stars. They are ALL idiots! This is a VERY GOOD MOVIE. Remember these are the SAME critics who probably gave BEVERLY HILLS CHICHUAHUA THREE Stars!This film is about a lot of things. Others have ""Broken"" it down (and therein lies the title)(it means many things in this film). I will given you what this film is really all about. It is about Facing Yourself Bravely. Even if you must confront the most difficult of obstacles to Free Yourself, to Be Yourself. That is simply what this is about. And it about those who choose to live life in a 'Fully Conscious' state of mind and reality at all times without compromise, without doubt, without relying or counting on others for support. That's HARD and that's BRAVE. And tha'ts PAINFUL. It's LONELY, DEPRESSING, SAD, and ISOLATING. All of thoose things. This film fills all of those voids deeply and painstakingly.Jeremy Sisto is simply pyschotic. he played the SAME role in WAITRESS. I wonder why he chose to play the SAME role? he wasn't a killer in WAITRESS, he was just a scumbag. Here, he is a drug addict, a scumbag, a psycho, a loser, a killer, and a delusional lonely hanger-on with INSIGHT. A painful kind of man. It's actually a BETTER role than WAITRESS but he is still playing another SCUMBAG. but HE DELIVERS THE GOODS!!HEATHER GRAHAM gives a very solid performance as well. I think its a too controlled performance and I think she could have done slightly more in terms of showing OUTWARD emotion rather than inward. Still, for HER, its a vast improvement in acting over some of the awful film roles she has had scuh as LOST IN SPACE (yuck).The supporting cast is GREAT. Jake Busey is funny and appropriate. Tess Harper is sad, amd gut wrenchingly real. (how could the critcs DENY her performance?)I implore you to watch this film MORE than once to understand the awkward uneasy editing of the OU TOF TIME LINEAR DE-DEQUENCES but after two or three views it makes more sense. This film is numbing and inspiring at the same time. It's an emotional rollercoaster yet it wipes you out. This is NOT a ""gfamily friendly"" movie. Not for the whole family. It's for mature adults. It's for intelligent people. It's not for the stoner crowd. It's for people who might want to think a little. It might not be for the Aristocracy of Beverly Hills. It's just too damn dark, deppressing and realistic. That's a comliment to the Director and the screnplay. I really enjoyed this film. Along with Chapter 27 I found it the two best indie films of 2007.",4,"A GREAT FILM FOR THE ""LIVING""!",1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,2624,"['LOT', 'going', 'film', 'IGNORE', 'Mainstream', 'critics', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'ONE', 'one', 'half', 'stars', 'are', 'idiots', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'MOVIE', 'Remember', 'are', 'SAME', 'critics', 'who', 'probably', 'gave', 'BEVERLY', 'HILLS', 'CHICHUAHUA', 'THREE', 'Stars', 'film', 'lot', 'things', 'Others', 'have', 'Broken', 'down', 'therein', 'title', 'many', 'things', 'film', 'will', 'given', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'Facing', 'Yourself', 'Bravely', 'Even', 'must', 'confront', 'most', 'difficult', 'obstacles', 'Free', 'Yourself', 'Be', 'simply', 'what', 'about', 'who', 'choose', 'live', 'life', ""'Fully"", 'Conscious', 'state', 'mind', 'reality', 'times', 'compromise', 'doubt', 'relying', 'counting', 'others', 'support', 'HARD', 'BRAVE', ""tha'ts"", 'PAINFUL', 'LONELY', 'DEPRESSING', 'SAD', 'ISOLATING', 'thoose', 'things', 'film', 'voids', 'deeply', 'painstakingly.Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'simply', 'pyschotic', 'played', 'SAME', 'role', 'WAITRESS', 'wonder', 'why', 'chose', 'play', 'SAME', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'killer', 'WAITRESS', 'was', 'just', 'scumbag', 'Here', 'drug', 'addict', 'scumbag', 'psycho', 'loser', 'killer', 'delusional', 'lonely', 'hanger-on', 'INSIGHT', 'painful', 'kind', 'man', 'actually', 'BETTER', 'role', 'WAITRESS', 'still', 'playing', 'SCUMBAG', 'HE', 'THE', 'GOODS', 'HEATHER', 'GRAHAM', 'very', 'solid', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'too', 'controlled', 'performance', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'slightly', 'more', 'terms', 'showing', 'OUTWARD', 'emotion', 'rather', 'inward', 'Still', 'HER', 'vast', 'improvement', 'acting', 'awful', 'film', 'roles', 'had', 'scuh', 'LOST', 'IN', 'SPACE', '.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'GREAT', 'Jake', 'Busey', 'funny', 'appropriate', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'sad', 'amd', 'gut', 'wrenchingly', 'real', 'how', 'could', 'critcs', 'DENY', 'performance', 'implore', 'watch', 'film', 'MORE', 'once', 'understand', 'awkward', 'uneasy', 'editing', 'OU', 'TOF', 'TIME', 'LINEAR', 'DE-DEQUENCES', 'two', 'three', 'views', 'more', 'sense', 'film', 'numbing', 'inspiring', 'same', 'time', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'yet', 'out', 'NOT', 'gfamily', 'friendly', 'movie', 'Not', 'whole', 'family', 'mature', 'adults', 'intelligent', 'people', 'not', 'stoner', 'crowd', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'want', 'think', 'little', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'Aristocracy', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'just', 'too', 'damn', 'dark', 'deppressing', 'realistic', 'comliment', 'Director', 'screnplay', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Chapter', '27', 'found', 'two', 'best', 'indie', 'films', '2007']",N/A

The jumping around is at times, hard to follow, but it all meshes together in the end. The best I can say without giving away the whole shooting match is that it involves a 24 hour period in the life of the protagonist, Hope (Heather Graham). Most of it, at least. For a great part of it, we see what she does when she's not dreaming of stardom as a musician, a waitress in a greasy spoon. The patrons of said greasy spoon are what can only be referred to as ""hangers-on"" and the typical losers normally found on city streets after those with a life have retired to their homes.Hope has a boyfriend (though the ""friend"" part is questionable, at best), Will (Jeremy Sisto), a self-destructive loser type who is not beyond spreading the wealth. Hope's life is slowly being flushed down the toilet with Will's help, and one wonders if she REALLY comes above the downward spiral she finds herself in (I found myself cheering on Will, because at times, Hope is acting too stupid to want to help!).Into this melee' are a barnload of what can only be referred to as ""Hollywood has-beens"". There is a haggard looking Linda Hamilton, as a ""Madam"" of sorts. A VERY haggard Tess Harper (who actually looked the part), and Jake Busey, who looks less like his father, and more like a low-brow neanderthal every time I see him. These are the denizens of the early morning Los Angeles. It amazed me how accurate their portrayals were, as I, myself used to live in L.A., and I saw these people every day, on my way to work! It IS amazing that young people STILL trek to Hollywood to be ""discovered"" (sort of the same type of lie that makes people believe that the island of Oahu is still a paradise!).""Broken"" is a sobering view of a life side-tracked by drugs, self-delusion and dreams of the type that make up the film's title.",4,What is THIS?!,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,1917,"['Broken', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'realized', 'not', 'unfold', 'linear', 'manner', 'jumping', 'around', 'times', 'hard', 'follow', 'together', 'end', 'best', 'can', 'say', 'giving', 'away', 'whole', 'shooting', 'match', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'life', 'protagonist', 'Hope', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Most', 'least', 'great', 'part', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'not', 'dreaming', 'stardom', 'musician', 'waitress', 'greasy', 'spoon', 'patrons', 'said', 'greasy', 'spoon', 'are', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'referred', 'hangers-on', 'typical', 'losers', 'normally', 'found', 'city', 'streets', 'life', 'have', 'retired', 'homes.Hope', 'boyfriend', 'friend', 'part', 'questionable', 'best', 'Will', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'self-destructive', 'loser', 'type', 'who', 'not', 'spreading', 'wealth', 'Hope', 'life', 'slowly', 'being', 'flushed', 'toilet', 'Will', 'help', 'one', 'wonders', 'REALLY', 'downward', 'spiral', 'found', 'cheering', 'Will', 'because', 'times', 'Hope', 'acting', 'too', 'stupid', 'want', 'help', 'melee', 'are', 'barnload', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'referred', 'Hollywood', 'has-beens', 'haggard', 'looking', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Madam', 'sorts', 'VERY', 'haggard', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'who', 'actually', 'looked', 'part', 'Jake', 'Busey', 'who', 'less', 'father', 'more', 'low-brow', 'neanderthal', 'time', 'see', 'are', 'denizens', 'early', 'morning', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'amazed', 'how', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'were', 'used', 'live', 'L.A.', 'saw', 'people', 'day', 'way', 'work', 'amazing', 'young', 'people', 'STILL', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'discovered', 'sort', 'same', 'type', 'lie', 'people', 'believe', 'island', 'Oahu', 'still', 'paradise', 'Broken', 'sobering', 'view', 'life', 'side-tracked', 'drugs', 'self-delusion', 'dreams', 'type', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'title']",N/A

1096929,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000UVV26K,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[6, 8]","A dense psychological drama that packs a walloping punch in a short hour and a half, Alan White's ""Broken"" is a testament to anyone who has ever been caught at an unfortunate crossroads in life, forced to look back at all the wrong exits taken.Heather Graham is Hope, a transplant from Cleveland stuck at a dead-end job as a waitress in a dive of a diner on the outskirts of Los Angeles. A struggling musician not completely given up on scoring her big break, the transgressions and evils that have colored her past come back and stare her dead in the face in one harrowing night before her shift ends at 6 a.m., forcing her to face the beasts within and struggle to free herself of them for good.Chief among her tormentors is Will, her ex-boyfriend portrayed by Jeremy Sisto. Through flashbacks it is shown why Hope allowed herself to fall in love and trust him implicitly, leaving herself open to manipulation and heroin addiction. Fed up with the wasted days, she refuses to let her life slip by as a slave to the drugs, and has asked him to keep away so that she may restore harmony in her life.Other demons to confront Hope flow like wine in the formof customers she waits on. A pair of junkies objectifies her and switches focus to her addiction, while a brooding, mysterious woman sits on her stool perched and observant, clearly the product of broken dreams and grave bodily abuse - possibly an indicator of what Hope could become. Vulgar record executives come in with their budding new starlets flanked by emaciated musicians, only to order side salads and insist not on yogurt but ""soygurt.""A brazen middle-aged woman even makes a sales pitch of sorts to Hope, soliciting her ""services"" to high-powered clientele - notably record executives - reminding her that there is only ""a finite amount of time in a young woman's life when the cards are in her favor."" It does not help that an ecstasy-ridden young girl wanders in with two unscrupulous men at either side, asking help of Hope when can barely help herself.As she puts it, the circumstances of Hope's night are quickly beginning to resemble a ""freak show."" Little does she know that Will is about to rear his ugly head again, unwilling to let her escape from his grasp again.Graham has a well-defined power that is subtle and dignified. Those only aware of her work in mainstream box office comedies need only sit through a few minutes of ""Broken"" to see it evidenced - she is not merely a pretty accessory to Mike Myers or Steve Martin, but a rich talent capable of becoming a story's centrifugal force. She injects her character with humanity, turning Hope into an everywoman the audience can empathize with. Sisto, who may run the risk of becoming typecast if he continues to portray intense, jealous types as he did in the late Adrienne Shelley's penultimate ""Waitress"" last year opposite Keri Russell, is also highly impressive as he embodies Will's one-track mind. With every fiber of his being consumed by winning back Hope's trust, Will becomes difficult for the viewer to dismiss, immediately holding a mirror up Hope's struggle to rid him from her life in order to get it back on track.Michael A. Goorjan and Tess Harper turn in praiseworthy supporting turns, helping transform an ordinary diner into a virtual nexus of Hope's universe. It is a universe where her hopes and dreams collide head on with her deepest fears and basest desires, all ensconced in blue - a chilly, cyanotic, neon blue. Even the name of the diner itself is The Blue Star.It's not the stuff of large box office grosses or coveted statuettes, but ""Broken"" deserves its place on the shelf.

You hope that Hope takes it. i gave the movie 1 star because it put way too much emphasis on the badness of Will instead of getting to know the character of Hope.

The screenplay was a train wreck, though, on several fronts.1.) Heather Graham stays with a guy she would never in real life give the time of day to.2.) The ""Pulp Fiction""-like story line jumped back and forth in time and was basically a mess. There were a few characters who were amusing--the two guys sitting in the booth [Gary Busey's son being one of them] were pretty funny. The ultimate message of the movie was interesting--that the Heather Graham character was going to turn out like all of her customers. The problem is that the dramatic structure is lacking in both apparent continuity and that none of the characters have believable motivations. You just find yourself saying ""No way"" all through the movie. And that's for stuff you can comprehend. Most of the way through this movie you're lost and the main character [Heather Graham] is behaving in a way that is unbelievable--staying with a loser heroin addict.In a word, this movie requires the willing suspension of disbelief. Well, this film did not convince me to suspend my disbelief.
