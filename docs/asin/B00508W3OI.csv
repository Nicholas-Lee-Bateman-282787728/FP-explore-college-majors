High alitude bomb runs very much in the Air corps minds at that time, of course your not going to see the nortan bomp site.very hush , hush for that era. I really dont think B-17s are going to make long bomb runs to Japan.

1435200,AX4DLEBHS9XEL,B00508W3OI,"Michael T. McCaffrey ""sumofan""","[0, 0]","I had seen this movie a long time ago and it stuck in my mind. The acting is tepid, the story plot is tepid, but the insight into the thinking of the time during WWII is, to me, very interesting and of value. Taking oneself out of the present day and inserting yourself into the mindset of our parents facing enemies devouring both Europe and Asia, and at war with the democracies, was a very scary proposition. This movie (warning: by present day standards is VERY &#34;corny&#34;) provides yet another glimpse into that era for those interested. Like &#34;Top Gun,&#34; it was also a recruiting tool for those interested in becoming a prized member of military flight crews at the time: the bombardier. Lastly, movies during that milieu featured stars singing/dancing. You might cringe when you hear &#34;our heroes&#34; singing the &#34;Bombardier&#34; song but, as (again) &#34;corny&#34; as would strike modern day observers, the darn thing stuck with me over the years (again: recruiting tool from days gone by). Bombardier is a welcomed addition to my WWII video library.
