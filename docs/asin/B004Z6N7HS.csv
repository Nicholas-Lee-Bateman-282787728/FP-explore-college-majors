1434277,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004Z6N7HS,DVD Verdict,"[15, 16]","Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- The story of Waris Dirie presented in this film is both true and extraordinary. However, an extraordinary true story does not always produce an extraordinary film. Desert Flower comes close at times, but continually finds ways to undercut itself. There are scenes of intense emotional power and unflinching reality presented in the film, but they sit uncomfortably alongside scenes of biopic convention and unpersuasive fairy tale sentiment.While I think it's important to avoid the distinction between scenes containing intense content and scenes that are actually high-caliber, Desert Flower's strongest moments are indeed its bleakest. The scenes that will remain in the memory long after the film concludes are those dealing with Waris' circumcision, particularly an excruciating sequence in which we watch her 3-year-old face as the procedure is performed. It's an angry, damning indictment of a barbaric process. Another painful yet tender moment occurs between Kebede and Hawkins, as the latter begins to realize what has been done to the former. These are scenes that tower above some of tiresome trivialities the film engages in during its weaker moments.So, the subject matter is there and the cast delivers. What Desert Flower needed was a steadier hand at the wheel.Desert Flower arrives on hi-def sporting a very attractive 1080p/1.85:1 transfer. The level of detail is spectacular throughout, flesh tones are warm and natural and the film's barren African locations look visually stunning and yet forbidding (the London locations are a bit less striking, but the marvelously expressive faces of actors like Spall and Hawkins are enough to compensate for that). Audio is equally excellent, with clean dialogue, immersive sound design and a well-mixed but occasionally overbearing original score. An early scene in a nightclub will give your speakers quite a workout, but it's noticeably louder than anything else in the film. Supplements include an interview with Kebede (17 minutes) and a trailer.-Full review at [...]",4,Occasionally fumbles its potent source material,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,2067,"['Judge', 'Clark', 'Douglas', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'story', 'Waris', 'Dirie', 'presented', 'film', 'true', 'extraordinary', 'However', 'extraordinary', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'always', 'produce', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'Desert', 'Flower', 'close', 'times', 'continually', 'ways', 'undercut', 'are', 'scenes', 'intense', 'emotional', 'power', 'unflinching', 'reality', 'presented', 'film', 'sit', 'uncomfortably', 'alongside', 'scenes', 'biopic', 'convention', 'unpersuasive', 'fairy', 'tale', 'sentiment.While', 'think', 'important', 'avoid', 'distinction', 'scenes', 'containing', 'intense', 'content', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'high-caliber', 'Desert', 'Flower', 'strongest', 'moments', 'are', 'indeed', 'bleakest', 'scenes', 'will', 'remain', 'memory', 'long', 'film', 'concludes', 'are', 'dealing', 'Waris', 'circumcision', 'particularly', 'excruciating', 'sequence', 'watch', '3-year-old', 'face', 'procedure', 'performed', 'angry', 'damning', 'indictment', 'barbaric', 'process', 'painful', 'yet', 'tender', 'moment', 'occurs', 'Kebede', 'Hawkins', 'latter', 'begins', 'realize', 'what', 'been', 'done', 'former', 'are', 'scenes', 'tower', 'tiresome', 'trivialities', 'film', 'weaker', 'moments.So', 'subject', 'matter', 'there', 'cast', 'delivers', 'What', 'Desert', 'Flower', 'needed', 'was', 'steadier', 'hand', 'wheel.Desert', 'Flower', 'hi-def', 'sporting', 'very', 'attractive', '1080p/1.85:1', 'transfer', 'level', 'detail', 'spectacular', 'flesh', 'tones', 'are', 'warm', 'natural', 'film', 'barren', 'African', 'locations', 'look', 'visually', 'stunning', 'yet', 'forbidding', 'London', 'locations', 'are', 'bit', 'less', 'striking', 'marvelously', 'expressive', 'actors', 'Spall', 'Hawkins', 'are', 'enough', 'compensate', 'Audio', 'equally', 'excellent', 'clean', 'dialogue', 'immersive', 'sound', 'design', 'well-mixed', 'occasionally', 'overbearing', 'original', 'score', 'early', 'scene', 'nightclub', 'will', 'give', 'speakers', 'quite', 'workout', 'noticeably', 'louder', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'Supplements', 'include', 'interview', 'Kebede', '17', 'minutes', 'trailer.-Full', 'review', '[', ']']",Desert Flower
1434278,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004Z6N7HS,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","DESERT FLOWER is a very powerful film that introduces many viewers to the atrocities of Female Genital Mutilation, defined by the dictionary as 'FGM, also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is defined as all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. FGM is typically carried out on girls from a few days old to puberty. It may take place in a hospital, but is usually performed, without anesthesia, by a traditional circumciser using a knife, razor, or scissors.' Though that is not the main driver of this story it certainly makes the life of Waris Dirie who wrote this autobiography recognized as someone who overcame insurmountable odds to become one the world's top models and a speaker for women's rights.Liya Kebede stars as Waris Darie and is the perfect choice of an actress to fill this role: she is an International supermodel, actress and philanthropist, born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 2003, she was the first woman of color to become the face of Est&eacute;e Lauder cosmetics.Waris Dirie (Liya Kebede) was born in Somalia and was subjected to FGM and fled across the desert to freedom form the heinous attitude toward women (Waris as a child is beautifully portrayed by Soraya Omar-Scego). She struggles though dreary jobs, eventually hooks up with Marilyn (Sally Hawkins0 who introduces her to the world of fashion via Terry Donaldson (Timothy Spall), learns how to dress and walk in heels and eventually becomes the great model we know us as today. She has love interests (Anthony Mackie) but her aim is to gain enough credibility and money to go before the WHO and speak aginst the mutilation that exists in many countries to this day.Directed by Sherry Horman who adapted Dirie's autobiography for the screen with Smita Bhide, the visuals are spectacular and the manner in which the story is related is full of passion and compassion.  The entire cast (including Juliet Stevenson, Meera Syal, and Craig Parkinson) is pitch perfect.  But it is Liya Kebede who fills the screen not only with her beauty but also with a powerful performance of the main character. A very fine film with a heavy message.

At the age of 3 she was victim of female genital mutilation (FGM) a barbarian practice still widespread in many countries in Northern and Eastern Africa. At age 13 she was given in marriage to a 60 years old neighbor - refusing this match she escaped and walked for nine days through the desert until she reached the house of her grandmother in Mogadishu. Rejected by her parents, she was ultimately send as a maid (in fact a slave) for the family of a Somali diplomat living in London. Very badly treated and working only for food, shelter and some old clothes she spend there six years almost never leaving the embassy and not even allowed to watch TV. When in 1985 the family she worked for had to leave Great Britain, she stayed behind, as homeless illegal immigrant. She finally managed to find a janitorial job in a McDonalds and it was there than in 1986 a famous photograph Terence Donovan discovered her, when she was cleaning the floor next to his table...What followed was a great career of top model, a couple of small movie roles (including in a James Bond movie), the writing of a bestselling autobiography and finally the launching of the first worldwide campaign against female genital mutilation (FGM), a barbarian custom NOT LINKED with any religion, which probably originated in Ancient Egypt at least 3000 years ago, long before the appearance of both Christianism and Islam (and maybe even predating Judaism). This horror is still practiced today in at least 28 states, most of them situated in Northern and Eastern Africa but also in Yemen and Indonesia. Waris Dirie campaign helped however to start a movement towards the decline and disappearance of FGM.Today, retired from modelling, mother of two sons, Waris Dirie lives most of the time in Austria and still fights against FGM.""Desert flower"" is a very well done, very realistic and very touching story of her life. Although ultimately very optimistic, this film contains also some scenes which I found harder to watch than most of the horror movies I ever saw...

She makes the arduous journey alone, through the desert to her grandmother in Mogadishu.  Civil war in Somalia leads her to London.  While living with diplomatic relatives, she is a maid - treated with disdain.  Diplomatic relations b/w the UK & Somalia end.  Waris is left in London, alone, destitute, without a good grasp of the language.  She learns how to live on the streets.  Eventually she befriends Marilyn; later the photographer, Terry Donaldson.  Her life now moves upward, in fairytale fashion.  She becomes an international supermodel.  She uses her fame to bring worldwide attention to female mutilation for the first time, eventually becoming the UN spokesperson for this cause.The film also calls attention to adversities women in Waris' culture face daily.  Her mother is beaten by her father for letting Waris leave before her wedding.  Yet, she lets Waris go because she knows it gives her daughter a chance for a better life. When Waris tells the story of her ""circumcision"", the wide-angle scene shot and narration are particularly poignant.  Her mother had to return to home to care for her other children, leaving toddler Waris alone in the wild.  Part of this may have been exaggerated for the screen but can women in the West even conceive of having to make decisions like that??Liya Kebede gives a great performance as adult Waris.  She projects Waris' innocence and indomitable spirit.  Fine performances from Soraya Omar-Scego as young Waris, and Sally Hawkins as Marilyn.  Excellent cinematography captures grand landscapes of Africa & London, and more intimate portrait shots.This film inspires due to the perseverance of its title character and the courage of the women she represents.
