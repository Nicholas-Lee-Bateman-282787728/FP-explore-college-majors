1128764,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B00111YM5Q,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[1, 4]","Great concepts. Extremely flawed execution. The makers of this movie did not know what they were doing is what I feel like saying (unfortunately).Bringing back the more old school type vampires was a great idea. These vampires are monsters. They're creepy pale-white ghouls with a mouth full of sharp teeth that scream and move around like the predators of the night that they are. They want to feed and not get caught. Not much more to them. The idea of having a vampire flick set in Alaska where it's night for an entire month is perfect and it makes you wonder how that hadn't been done before. The head vampire actually says at one point that they should have already come to that town a long time ago.The reason the movie doesn't work is because it isn't scary or suspenseful and there is no real build up to the action. Watching it you have a sense it could have been a truly great horror film classic if handled by a talented director. It starts off OK, but lets you down. Maybe the problem is in the editing. You never get a sense of the time. It all ends up seeming like one night, or maybe a few days. Not an entire month. And that's a problem for a movie that has in it's very title that it is 30 days and the main and original idea is this time frame. I also had a problem with the main character's choice at the end. What a dumb***. Well girls do have power over a man now don't they. Haaa. How romantic of him. And what he then does is not believable. All of a sudden throws a punch - and wow what a punch! I'll leave it at that. So it ends up kind stupid. It's a rental if you enjoy the vampire genre.",2,Rental,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,1616,"['Great', 'concepts', 'Extremely', 'flawed', 'execution', 'makers', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'what', 'feel', 'saying', 'unfortunately', '.Bringing', 'back', 'more', 'old', 'school', 'type', 'vampires', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'vampires', 'are', 'monsters', ""'re"", 'creepy', 'pale-white', 'ghouls', 'mouth', 'full', 'sharp', 'teeth', 'scream', 'move', 'predators', 'night', 'are', 'want', 'feed', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'Not', 'much', 'more', 'idea', 'having', 'vampire', 'flick', 'set', 'Alaska', 'where', 'night', 'entire', 'month', 'perfect', 'wonder', 'how', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'before', 'head', 'vampire', 'actually', 'one', 'point', 'should', 'have', 'already', 'come', 'town', 'long', 'time', 'ago.The', 'reason', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', ""n't"", 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'real', 'build', 'up', 'action', 'Watching', 'have', 'sense', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'classic', 'handled', 'talented', 'director', 'OK', 'down', 'Maybe', 'problem', 'editing', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'time', 'up', 'seeming', 'one', 'night', 'maybe', 'few', 'days', 'Not', 'entire', 'month', 'problem', 'movie', 'very', 'title', '30', 'days', 'main', 'original', 'idea', 'time', 'frame', 'also', 'had', 'problem', 'main', 'character', 'choice', 'end', 'What', 'dumb***', 'Well', 'girls', 'do', 'have', 'power', 'man', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'Haaa', 'How', 'romantic', 'what', 'then', 'not', 'believable', 'sudden', 'punch', 'wow', 'what', 'punch', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'up', 'kind', 'stupid', 'rental', 'enjoy', 'vampire', 'genre']",N/A
1128765,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00111YM5Q,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 6]","`30 Days of Night' starts with an admirable idea:  How about a vampire story in Northern Alaska during the dead of winter when there is no sunlight for about a month?  There's so much you can do with cold and darkness to make a chilling horror adventure, and there have been many movies done recently in this vein, (including `Wind Chill' and `First Snow').  Based on screenwriter Steve Niles' co-authored comic series, the film descends into the darkness, but just like the protagonists who fight the villains off from their Barrow, AK town, they sometimes lose opportunities to be effective.The story starts just before the winter solstice.  In ritual fashion the Barrow citizens see the last sunset they will witness for nearly thirty days. Included in that ritual is the sheriff, Eben (Josh Hartnett) and his separated wife, Stella (Melissa George) who face the demanding winter with routine resignation.  Eben stays close to his teenage brother, Jake (Mark Rendall) and grandmother (Elizabeth McRae), while Stella misses a consequential flight back to Anchorage.Soon after their last sunset, strange occurrences come upon their small town.  Lights go out, power is extinguished, and a whole kennel of sled dogs (huskies) is brutally killed.  After that more mishaps are presented, including a strange accident between Stella and a man driving heavy machinery.  Startlingly, the shrieks of mysterious creatures show up on the scene and attack isolated people.  Soon scattered victims are found with elaborate neck wounds at messy crime scenes.  From there the sheriff gathers with some people as they lock themselves behind closed doors to wait out the ordeal and flee when they can to a generator plant.  Without the respite of a sunrise to help them regroup, they have to resort to other methods once they've decided it is indeed vampires plaguing their town.One of the great flaws of the film is its diminishing suspense.  They give up the ghost early and often.  Truly scary for the first 2/5 of the running time, we meet the hideous creatures as they gather together.  The vampire parleys have them speaking in their native language, and, while, this works well in 'Star Wars' for fun, here it's almost laughable.  Meant to explain their motivations, it doesn't tell us much and has the effect of merely showcasing bad dialogue and making their menace seem silly at times.There are also other credibility gaps.  At one point Eben has a chance to save his town and a woman who's put at risk from the whole throng of vampires.  Why doesn't he try to do something to destroy them and save the whole town all at once?  My best guess is that because the movie is only slightly more than half over, they have to have Sheriff Eben do something stupid, so we can reach an equally incredulous conclusion.While all horror pictures shouldn't be the same, I couldn't help but draw comparisons to M. Night Shymalan's `Signs (Vista Series),' which used suspense expertly and only gave us glimpses of the perceived aliens until the end.  I also thought of `Insomnia (Full Screen Edition),' a thriller, starring Robin Williams and Al Pacino, where they used sunshine and sleeplessness to better effect than they did with the Alaskan elements here.  While I could see that editor, Art Jones, did many admirable things that we've seen in movies like '28 Weeks Later (Full-Screen Version),' his yeoman work only takes us so far.  From the jolts of the first half hour, the movie turns from scary and suspenseful to a gruesome and pointless arcade.",2,Fresh Blood Injected...Coagulates,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,3537,"['30', 'Days', 'Night', 'starts', 'admirable', 'idea', 'How', 'vampire', 'story', 'Northern', 'Alaska', 'dead', 'winter', 'when', 'sunlight', 'month', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'cold', 'darkness', 'make', 'chilling', 'horror', 'adventure', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'movies', 'done', 'recently', 'vein', 'including', 'Wind', 'Chill', 'First', 'Snow', 'Based', 'screenwriter', 'Steve', 'Niles', 'co-authored', 'comic', 'series', 'film', 'darkness', 'just', 'protagonists', 'who', 'fight', 'villains', 'Barrow', 'AK', 'town', 'sometimes', 'lose', 'opportunities', 'be', 'effective.The', 'story', 'just', 'winter', 'solstice', 'ritual', 'fashion', 'Barrow', 'citizens', 'see', 'last', 'sunset', 'will', 'witness', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'days', 'Included', 'ritual', 'sheriff', 'Eben', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'separated', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Melissa', 'George', 'who', 'face', 'demanding', 'winter', 'routine', 'resignation', 'Eben', 'close', 'teenage', 'brother', 'Jake', 'Mark', 'Rendall', 'Elizabeth', 'McRae', 'Stella', 'consequential', 'flight', 'back', 'Anchorage.Soon', 'last', 'sunset', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'come', 'small', 'town', 'Lights', 'go', 'out', 'power', 'extinguished', 'whole', 'kennel', 'sled', 'dogs', 'huskies', 'brutally', 'killed', 'more', 'mishaps', 'are', 'presented', 'including', 'strange', 'accident', 'Stella', 'man', 'driving', 'heavy', 'machinery', 'Startlingly', 'shrieks', 'mysterious', 'creatures', 'show', 'up', 'scene', 'attack', 'isolated', 'people', 'Soon', 'scattered', 'victims', 'are', 'found', 'elaborate', 'neck', 'wounds', 'messy', 'crime', 'scenes', 'sheriff', 'gathers', 'people', 'lock', 'closed', 'doors', 'wait', 'out', 'ordeal', 'flee', 'when', 'can', 'generator', 'plant', 'respite', 'sunrise', 'help', 'regroup', 'have', 'resort', 'other', 'methods', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'indeed', 'vampires', 'plaguing', 'town.One', 'great', 'flaws', 'film', 'diminishing', 'suspense', 'give', 'up', 'ghost', 'early', 'often', 'Truly', 'scary', 'first', '2/5', 'running', 'time', 'meet', 'hideous', 'creatures', 'gather', 'together', 'vampire', 'parleys', 'have', 'speaking', 'native', 'language', 'well', ""'Star"", 'Wars', 'fun', 'here', 'almost', 'laughable', 'Meant', 'explain', 'motivations', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'effect', 'merely', 'showcasing', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'making', 'menace', 'seem', 'silly', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'credibility', 'gaps', 'one', 'point', 'Eben', 'chance', 'save', 'town', 'woman', 'who', 'put', 'risk', 'whole', 'throng', 'vampires', 'Why', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'something', 'destroy', 'save', 'whole', 'town', 'once', 'best', 'guess', 'movie', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'half', 'have', 'have', 'Sheriff', 'Eben', 'do', 'something', 'stupid', 'can', 'reach', 'equally', 'incredulous', 'conclusion.While', 'horror', 'pictures', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shymalan', 'Signs', 'Vista', 'Series', 'used', 'suspense', 'expertly', 'only', 'gave', 'glimpses', 'perceived', 'aliens', 'end', 'also', 'thought', 'Insomnia', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'where', 'used', 'sunshine', 'sleeplessness', 'better', 'effect', 'did', 'Alaskan', 'elements', 'here', 'could', 'see', 'editor', 'Art', 'Jones', 'did', 'many', 'admirable', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', ""'28"", 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Full-Screen', 'Version', 'yeoman', 'work', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'jolts', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'gruesome', 'pointless', 'arcade']",N/A
1128766,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00111YM5Q,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 2]","30 Days of Night felt very refreshing in comparison to many horror movies I've seen lately. It also has a very creepy and terrifying feel to it, something I haven't felt in a horror film in years (Seriously, horror movies literally don't scare me anymore).WHAT IT'S ABOUT: This film takes place in a small Alaskan town in which every year during the winter there is a 30 day period of only night. Then mysteriously, a nasty horde of vampires show up in town when this period begins and then start killing everyone in town or turning them into more bloodthirsty vampires. The movie is mostly centered around a group of survivors who try to survive the thirty days, because if the vampires hear and find somebody they get killed in gruesome ways. So this means sneaking past, trying to avoid making noise, and trying to stay alive.STORYLINE- SCORE: 8 OUT OF 10: It doesn't exactly have the most impressive story ever, but it at least feels more original than many horror movies made these days.GORE FACTOR- SCORE: 8.75 OUT OF 10: I've seen better blood and gore effects, but that doesn't mean this horror flick isn't gruesome. Gore ranges from chopping off heads with axes, vampires being ground up in giant drills, being fried by sunlight, stabbing, to blowing away vampires with shotguns, etc.CREEPY FACTOR- SCORE: 9 OUT OF 10: This movie gave me an eerie chill that only comes from horror movies I find to be unique and different. The whole surviving for thirty days feels realistic, kind of the eerie realistic survival feel from 28 Days Later of would could really happen in that kind of situation.VAMPIRE DESIGNS- SCORE: 8.25 OUT OF 10: Could have been better, but they do look different from many vampires. The faces have more ovalized eyes, pale-white skin, black eyes, sharp claws, thin sharp teeth, and oddly shaped faces.PRESENTATION- SCORE: 8.5 OUT OF 10: The movie is well-made, but unfortunately, it's slow in the beginning which does hurt the score that I gave it. The creepy vibe is well-represented with nothing but darkness and vampires (that seem almost like freaky running zombies) everywhere. Plus, it has an authentic feel to it. Like you can't help but imagine that this would probably happen if vampires invaded some place. There are some nail-biting moments as well, in which you are afraid of what happens next because of some of the situations in the movie.OVERALL: It could have been more, because it does come up short in certain areas, but it's a great movie nonetheless. It's an easy recommendation to any fans of horror movies. Plus, this would be one of hell of a game. I would look forward to playing a video game version of 30 Days of Night because it seems like a no-brainer for a game idea. But, I loved 30 Days of Night, and it's not something I'm going to forget any time soon.",4,"NOT THE BEST HORROR MOVIE I'VE SEEN, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY CREEPY  8.5 OUT OF 10",1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2814,"['30', 'Days', 'Night', 'felt', 'very', 'refreshing', 'comparison', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'also', 'very', 'creepy', 'terrifying', 'feel', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'horror', 'film', 'years', 'Seriously', 'horror', 'movies', 'literally', 'do', ""n't"", 'scare', 'anymore', '.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'film', 'place', 'small', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'year', 'winter', '30', 'day', 'period', 'only', 'night', 'Then', 'mysteriously', 'nasty', 'horde', 'vampires', 'show', 'up', 'town', 'when', 'period', 'then', 'start', 'killing', 'everyone', 'town', 'turning', 'more', 'bloodthirsty', 'vampires', 'movie', 'mostly', 'centered', 'group', 'survivors', 'who', 'try', 'survive', 'thirty', 'days', 'vampires', 'hear', 'find', 'somebody', 'get', 'killed', 'gruesome', 'ways', 'sneaking', 'trying', 'avoid', 'making', 'noise', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive.STORYLINE-', 'SCORE', '8', 'OUT', '10', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'most', 'impressive', 'story', 'ever', 'least', 'feels', 'more', 'original', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'made', 'days.GORE', 'FACTOR-', 'SCORE', '8.75', 'OUT', '10', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'blood', 'gore', 'effects', ""n't"", 'mean', 'horror', 'flick', ""n't"", 'gruesome', 'Gore', 'chopping', 'off', 'heads', 'axes', 'vampires', 'being', 'ground', 'up', 'giant', 'drills', 'being', 'fried', 'sunlight', 'stabbing', 'blowing', 'away', 'vampires', 'shotguns', 'etc.CREEPY', 'FACTOR-', 'SCORE', '9', 'OUT', '10', 'movie', 'gave', 'eerie', 'chill', 'only', 'horror', 'movies', 'find', 'be', 'unique', 'different', 'whole', 'surviving', 'thirty', 'days', 'feels', 'realistic', 'kind', 'eerie', 'realistic', 'survival', 'feel', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'would', 'could', 'really', 'happen', 'kind', 'situation.VAMPIRE', 'DESIGNS-', 'SCORE', '8.25', 'OUT', '10', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'do', 'look', 'different', 'many', 'vampires', 'have', 'more', 'ovalized', 'eyes', 'pale-white', 'skin', 'black', 'eyes', 'sharp', 'claws', 'thin', 'sharp', 'teeth', 'oddly', 'shaped', 'faces.PRESENTATION-', 'SCORE', '8.5', 'OUT', '10', 'movie', 'well-made', 'unfortunately', 'slow', 'beginning', 'hurt', 'score', 'gave', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'well-represented', 'nothing', 'darkness', 'vampires', 'seem', 'almost', 'freaky', 'running', 'zombies', 'everywhere', 'authentic', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagine', 'would', 'probably', 'happen', 'vampires', 'invaded', 'place', 'are', 'nail-biting', 'moments', 'well', 'are', 'afraid', 'what', 'next', 'situations', 'movie.OVERALL', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'certain', 'areas', 'great', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'easy', 'recommendation', 'fans', 'horror', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'hell', 'game', 'would', 'look', 'forward', 'playing', 'video', 'game', 'version', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'no-brainer', 'game', 'idea', 'loved', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'not', 'something', ""'m"", 'going', 'forget', 'time', 'soon']",N/A

Which managed to be much better than this bore of a movie while being less than an hour in length.This movie was touted as being the first actually ""scary"" vampire movie in quite some time, well, I will admit that the idea that garbage like this gets made IS indeed scary to me, I can't say that I was the least bit nervous watching it. If anything, I found myself looking at my watch... waiting for something cool to happen, but of course nothing ever did, save the occasional obvious foul-up in the film's editing. Seriously, whoever cut this movie was either an idiot, or took the viewing audience for a bunch of primates because the editing was ALMOST as bad as Pathfinder's.The only remotely gross scene in this movie was when the guy is forced to behead his friend in a gory and completely pointless scene only left in for shock value. How it got past the MPAA, I can only imagine, perhaps test audiences were already asleep by then and missed it.But really, I could go on and on about why this movie was so awful...

1128769,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B00111YM5Q,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","How do you turn30 Days of Nighta beautifully laid out graphic novel into a somewhat less than mediocre movie? Good question and, that's not my only big question. Where do vampires shop for clothes? Shoes? Who cuts their hair? Do they use electric shavers or do they use blades? What are they talking about when they are not hissing - they seem to have a language. Is there a vampire mating season? When a baby vampire is born, what do the parents do to properly socialize their kids? How cold does it get near the North Pole in the winter? What do these vampires do in the Summer or in a regular day? Especially in places like Alaska where there can be 30 days of non-stop daylight? Do vampires have hobbies, regular jobs or all they do is obsess themselves with eating and hissing at each other? How many humans must a vampire consume in an average day/year and... given the vampires continuous appetite for fresh human blood, how does our government react to the shrinking taxpayer population, especially in a place like Alaska where they don't have too many of them to begin with?These were some of the thoughts I was thinking why trying, unsuccessfully, to pay attention to this movie's... action. For what it's worth, the story is that of small group of survivors on a far North Alaskan town that is in the dark for one full month that's taken over by hungry vampires who try to kill everybody and even consume a little blood in a piranha-like eating frenzy. I was asking myself all of those questions because these vampires are shown as a different species - by their looks, no possibility of easy full human-to-vampire conversion - so one can't help but wondering how do they pick their clothes. And, given that most of them vampire males in the movie are clean shaved (unlike the human males who are either bearded or unshaved) and they have nice haircuts, such questions beg themselves. And, then... what are they talking about all day long? They seem to have some rudiments of language but, since all we see them doing is hissing, staring at each other or scratching/biting people, how do they grow up, how do their leaders get an education - I am asking because this group's leader appears to know something about his species' history from the past few centuries. Not to mention little details such as where exactly or approximately did dozens of hungry vampires come from or what were their plans after the 30-day night-only ended? Oh, and one more thing - global warming notwithstanding, isn't Alaska, North of the polar circle, terribly cold in the winter? Because open-collar shirts an no mittens maybe worked for the vampires but the humans weren't that warmly dressed either and they didn't seem to mind.With so many outstanding and unanswered questions, talking about the movie is not easy because there's not much to talk about. As hard as the actors worked at turning a bad script into something remotely plausible - and they did try their best - you just can't make a passable movie when there is so little to work with. Vampires are obsessed with eating, humans seem to try to survive but, several times, after they find a shelter from where they could wait out the hungry and evil creatures they talk each other into yet another risky move that, invariably, gets a few more of them killed. The vampires themselves, it's not clear why they insist on staying in town for 30 days/nights after they quickly kill nearly everyone in sight and, again... where do they go from there? Where have they been for the past few hundred years?This movie fails the viewer at 'task one' which is 'suspension of disbelief'. Instead of allowing myself to be scared by the intimidating-looking, blood-thirsty beasts and rooting for the hopeless humans, I kept asking myself all those questions (see first paragraph) and only finding reasons to laugh at the sometimes comic inconsistencies in the awkward story-telling. The somewhat innovative ending is nice but the one-on-one battle scene between the main human and the vampire chief that precedes seems to be inserted for no particular reason - since it doesn't actually end the movie - and kind of spoils the real ending that follows.Two stars are well deserved for the actors' effort where almost everything else was a failure.

It was better than I thought it would be, though not fantastic.I certainly would not call this ""the best vampire movie ever"" as many others have.It's a pretty stereotypical horror movie really. It even follows your usual formula for who lives and dies. The character who wants to run off and leave someone else behind to die is the one who dies himself and then you have your run-of-the-mill hero who sacrifices himself along with your troubled, but reliable-when-it-matters leading man and tough, gun-wielding blonde leading lady. Just the same as almost every other movie of this type.The flaws in this film are: Wouldn't people eventually ask questions when every year an entire Alaskan town is wiped out in winter by a blood-sucking ""fire""? I am assuming that the vampires have to eat at least once every year, so this would keep happening over and over. And where do the vampires buy all their business suits and silver moonboots? And why are they speaking the Mayan language from Apocalypto? And (the most important question) Why, oh why! Don't they actually drink any of the blood? They rip people's throats open and get as much of the blood as possible on the top of their own heads and they spill as much as they can all over the ground, but not one drop seems to ever get inside their fish-like, gaping maws.My final note: The high-pitched screaming noise they make at every turn = very annoying.Overall the movie is a solid C, possibly even a C-.

AS far as suspension of disbelief goes, the movie takes some real liberties with the town of Barrow, Alaska, which in reality is both larger, and not nearly so isolated during the long dark period it endures every year.  The movie is not without its cliches, and the pacing is uneven, but one thing about this movie makes up for a lot of that, and that is this film's portrayal of vampires.Ever since Polidori's novel ""The Vampyre"" was published in 1819, there has been a trend to represent vampires as suave, sophisticated, aristocratic creatures.  Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" with its sexual undertones, reinforced this trend and also helped add an element of seductiveness to the monster.  Since the vampire came to the silver screen, this trend has only gathered force (and Anne Rice really took this concept and ran with it), until now the typical movie vampire is a charismatic, refined, immortal metrosexual.  Somewhere along the way, its as if everyone forgot the vampire was originally supposed to be a MONSTER.In their folkloric origins, there was nothing refined or seductive about vampires.  They were soulless, animated corpses, often described as bloated or ruddy in appearance, with fetid breath and a corpselike stench.  They didn't move freely among humans, but preyed on them from outside human society.  This movie's vampires represent a partial return to that concept of the vampire, and whether or not that appeals to you, it marks a refreshing change from what has become a rather tedious norm.  Instead of a bunch of effete dandies, who occasionally bare their fangs to bite the humans with whom they freely mingle, this movie's vampires are ravenous, blood-hungry predators, whose mouthful of shark-like teeth never disappear, and whose long, talon-like fingernails never magically retract to leave normal looking human hands.  These are creatures who must exist on the fringe of human society, never getting too close, as they can't blend in, nor would they have any wish to.  They are thoroughly malevolent, and utterly sadistic fiends, and as such, are something movie vampires haven't been in a long time (at least not to me) -- scary.",3,"Flawed movie, but with an interesting take on vampires",1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,2202,"['not', 'movie', 'problems', 'AS', 'far', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'real', 'liberties', 'town', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'reality', 'larger', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'isolated', 'long', 'dark', 'period', 'year', 'movie', 'not', 'cliches', 'pacing', 'uneven', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'up', 'lot', 'film', 'portrayal', 'vampires.Ever', 'Polidori', 'novel', 'Vampyre', 'was', 'published', '1819', 'been', 'trend', 'represent', 'vampires', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'aristocratic', 'creatures', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'sexual', 'undertones', 'reinforced', 'trend', 'also', 'helped', 'add', 'element', 'seductiveness', 'monster', 'vampire', 'came', 'silver', 'screen', 'trend', 'only', 'gathered', 'force', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'really', 'took', 'concept', 'ran', 'now', 'typical', 'movie', 'vampire', 'charismatic', 'refined', 'immortal', 'metrosexual', 'Somewhere', 'way', 'everyone', 'forgot', 'vampire', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'MONSTER.In', 'folkloric', 'origins', 'was', 'nothing', 'refined', 'seductive', 'vampires', 'were', 'soulless', 'animated', 'corpses', 'often', 'described', 'bloated', 'ruddy', 'appearance', 'fetid', 'breath', 'corpselike', 'stench', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'freely', 'humans', 'preyed', 'outside', 'human', 'society', 'movie', 'vampires', 'represent', 'partial', 'return', 'concept', 'vampire', 'not', 'appeals', 'refreshing', 'change', 'what', 'become', 'rather', 'tedious', 'norm', 'Instead', 'bunch', 'effete', 'dandies', 'who', 'occasionally', 'bare', 'fangs', 'bite', 'humans', 'whom', 'freely', 'mingle', 'movie', 'vampires', 'are', 'ravenous', 'blood-hungry', 'predators', 'mouthful', 'shark-like', 'teeth', 'never', 'disappear', 'long', 'talon-like', 'fingernails', 'never', 'magically', 'retract', 'leave', 'normal', 'looking', 'human', 'hands', 'are', 'creatures', 'who', 'must', 'exist', 'fringe', 'human', 'society', 'never', 'getting', 'too', 'close', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blend', 'would', 'have', 'wish', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'malevolent', 'utterly', 'sadistic', 'fiends', 'such', 'are', 'something', 'movie', 'vampires', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'long', 'time', 'least', 'not', 'scary']",N/A

1128778,AS31UPUVR0MZB,B00111YM5Q,Amazoning,"[2, 2]","I never heard of ""30 Days of Night"" until the movie was released.  The concept of a remote Alaskan town under siege by vampires during the time when the sun doesn't show for 30 days struck me as fresh and interesting.  The movie did not disappoint.  Adding to the brilliance of the concept is that the vampires are portrayed as being anything but romantic creatures who woo their victims into submission.  Romance, and religion, have been removed from the vampire equation, which adds to the appeal of the film's story.  The vampires are coldly intelligent predators, whose idea of foreplay is to take someone's throat out.  Danny Huston's portrayal of the leader of the vampire pack is amazing, proving you don't need pounds of prosthetics and hours of CG to provide a fright.  Mr. Huston, and his scary band of vampires, deserve top billing.Barrow, the hapless town targeted by the vampires, is cut off from the rest of world due to the weather, and the sabotage of the vampires' advance scout.  Town residents are taken out in scenes of all out carnage.  A memorable sequence is a continuous overhead shot that moves through one of the town's streets, showing the vampires dragging people from their homes, and the folks of Barrow trying to fight off the vampires.  The scene slams home how the vampires use surprise to subdue and slaughter the town folks, dropping the already low human population of Barrow (the majority of the town's residents regularly leave the town during the month of darkness, unable to cope with not having any sunlight for so long) down to a few survivors trying to hide.  After the initial blood bath, the movie moves into the suspense factor, as the remaining humans try to avoid the vampires until the sun rises again, and the vampires use their wiles to hunt down the remaining humans.  Very scary.  Take the movie's R rating seriously.There are some holes in the plot - the biggest being the ending.

1128785,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B00111YM5Q,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[84, 98]","30 Days of Night is pretty much a siege movie with heavy elements of horror and gore. Siege movies always succeed and fail depending on whether the tension and dread built up from the beginning of the film suspends the audience's disbelief. Siege films like The Thing and Romero's Living Dead trilogy works well because right from the get-go we see the tension build not just on the location the cast are put in but within the besieged survivors as well. Survival becomes that much more difficult due to human frailties and an inability to work together bringing the whole group down. The monsters outside are bad enough, but sometimes it's the survivors themselves who must share the blame.David Slade's (director) movie does a very good job of bringing the initial tension and dread the comic brought to life in its first chapter. The story takes place in Barrow, Alaska which happens to be located within the Arctic Circle as to allow it a very peculiar yearly event of having pitch-black night which lasts for a period of an entire month. The movie begins just as the town of Barrow prepares for this month-long prolonged night. Most of the town decide to move down south for the month where the night doesn't last as long, but enough stay in Barrow to give it a semblance of life and activity.The build-up of the characters in 30 Days of Night marks one of the weaknesses in the film. There's barely much characterization in distinguishing one Barrow, Alaskan from another. The lack in character development from all the characters whether human or vampire doesn't invest the film with anyone we want to see make it out through the night and into dawn. Even Danny Huston, a very underrated and overly capable actor in past films, fails to elevate his lead vampire character Marlowe beyond it's genre trappings. Known only as The Stranger in the credits, Ben Foster's Renfield-like character edges between caricature and genuine creepiness in his performance. Foster knows he's in a genre movie and has fun with the character. He's the only one to truly take on his character and roll with it.I now get to the subject of the vampires themselves. Most vampire movies seem enamored in portraying the vampire as some sort of seductive, fashion-obsessed, or in the case of the Anne Rice-type anachronistic in their dress, with an unnatural immortality they either live as hedonistically as possible or bemoan their cursed existence. There's never been a true portrayal of the vampire as a pure, hunger-driven monster with an appetite to match their status as one of folklore and legend's top-tier boogeymen. Slade goes for speed and agility in his vampires instead of hypnotizing and mesmerizing their victims. The vampires in this movie owes much to the frenetic and over-amped infecteds of 28 Days Later.The attack itself and the subsequent siege worked well enough in the early going. There were some great overhead shots of the town's people losing it's fight during the initial feeding frenzy as the camera shoots the scene high overhead. The only thing Slade had a misstep in terms of the siege itself was after those first couple of nights. The rest of the 30 days didn't seem to show enough desperation on the faces and bodies of the last few survivors. Really, the only way the audience even knew a couple weeks have passed were the caption telling them how many days into the month-long night has passed. I think with some better editing and a better sense of structure in the middle section of the movie to show time actually progressing the movie would've been many levels better.All in all, 30 Days of Night was just good enough that I had a fun time watching it. The premise itself was original and put a new spin on the vampire genre that has rarely been tapped. The performances were pretty average with no one bringing the whole film down with a misstep performance or raising the bar with a great one. The final product had a chance to be something great, but just ends up being a good and original take on the vampire story with elements of Night of the Living Dead.",3,A good but flawed adaptation,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,4085,"['30', 'Days', 'Night', 'pretty', 'much', 'siege', 'movie', 'heavy', 'elements', 'horror', 'gore', 'Siege', 'movies', 'always', 'succeed', 'fail', 'depending', 'tension', 'dread', 'built', 'up', 'beginning', 'film', 'audience', 'disbelief', 'Siege', 'films', 'Thing', 'Romero', 'Living', 'Dead', 'trilogy', 'works', 'well', 'right', 'get-go', 'see', 'tension', 'not', 'just', 'location', 'cast', 'are', 'put', 'besieged', 'survivors', 'as', 'well', 'Survival', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'due', 'human', 'frailties', 'inability', 'work', 'together', 'bringing', 'whole', 'group', 'down', 'monsters', 'are', 'bad', 'enough', 'survivors', 'who', 'must', 'share', 'blame.David', 'Slade', 'director', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'initial', 'tension', 'dread', 'comic', 'brought', 'life', 'first', 'chapter', 'story', 'place', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'be', 'located', 'Arctic', 'Circle', 'allow', 'very', 'peculiar', 'yearly', 'event', 'having', 'pitch-black', 'night', 'period', 'entire', 'month', 'movie', 'just', 'town', 'Barrow', 'month-long', 'prolonged', 'night', 'Most', 'town', 'decide', 'move', 'down', 'south', 'month', 'where', 'night', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'enough', 'stay', 'Barrow', 'give', 'semblance', 'life', 'activity.The', 'build-up', 'characters', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'marks', 'one', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'barely', 'much', 'characterization', 'distinguishing', 'one', 'Barrow', 'Alaskan', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'characters', 'human', 'vampire', ""n't"", 'invest', 'film', 'anyone', 'want', 'see', 'make', 'out', 'night', 'dawn', 'Even', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'very', 'underrated', 'overly', 'capable', 'actor', 'past', 'films', 'fails', 'elevate', 'lead', 'vampire', 'character', 'Marlowe', 'genre', 'trappings', 'Known', 'only', 'Stranger', 'credits', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Renfield-like', 'character', 'edges', 'caricature', 'genuine', 'creepiness', 'performance', 'Foster', 'genre', 'movie', 'fun', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'truly', 'take', 'character', 'roll', 'it.I', 'now', 'get', 'subject', 'vampires', 'Most', 'vampire', 'movies', 'seem', 'enamored', 'portraying', 'vampire', 'sort', 'seductive', 'fashion-obsessed', 'case', 'Anne', 'Rice-type', 'anachronistic', 'dress', 'unnatural', 'immortality', 'either', 'live', 'as', 'hedonistically', 'possible', 'bemoan', 'cursed', 'existence', 'never', 'been', 'true', 'portrayal', 'vampire', 'pure', 'hunger-driven', 'monster', 'appetite', 'match', 'status', 'one', 'folklore', 'legend', 'top-tier', 'boogeymen', 'Slade', 'speed', 'agility', 'vampires', 'instead', 'hypnotizing', 'mesmerizing', 'victims', 'vampires', 'movie', 'much', 'frenetic', 'over-amped', 'infecteds', '28', 'Days', 'Later.The', 'attack', 'subsequent', 'siege', 'worked', 'well', 'enough', 'early', 'going', 'were', 'great', 'overhead', 'shots', 'town', 'people', 'losing', 'fight', 'initial', 'feeding', 'frenzy', 'camera', 'scene', 'high', 'overhead', 'only', 'thing', 'Slade', 'had', 'misstep', 'terms', 'siege', 'was', 'first', 'couple', 'nights', 'rest', '30', 'days', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'show', 'enough', 'desperation', 'bodies', 'last', 'few', 'survivors', 'Really', 'only', 'way', 'audience', 'even', 'knew', 'couple', 'weeks', 'have', 'passed', 'were', 'caption', 'telling', 'how', 'many', 'days', 'month-long', 'night', 'passed', 'think', 'better', 'editing', 'better', 'sense', 'structure', 'middle', 'section', 'movie', 'show', 'time', 'actually', 'progressing', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'many', 'levels', 'better.All', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'enough', 'had', 'fun', 'time', 'watching', 'premise', 'was', 'original', 'put', 'new', 'spin', 'vampire', 'genre', 'rarely', 'been', 'tapped', 'performances', 'were', 'pretty', 'average', 'one', 'bringing', 'whole', 'film', 'down', 'misstep', 'performance', 'raising', 'bar', 'great', 'one', 'final', 'product', 'had', 'chance', 'be', 'something', 'great', 'just', 'up', 'being', 'good', 'original', 'take', 'vampire', 'story', 'elements', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead']",N/A

Vampire movies are a dime-a-dozen, most of them severely romanticizing the toothy villains. But Slade gives them no sway. In 30 Days Of Night they are brutal, strong, extremely old, and after only one thing: fresh meat to satiate their insatiable hunger.The unfortunate victims of their bloodthirst is the Alaskan town of Barrow. Anyone who knows anything about geography and oil knows that Barrow is at the ""top of the world,"" cradled on the edge of the arctic ocean where the Alaskan pipeline is the dominant feature. It also means that this little shanty-ish town is well above the arctic circle, a place where the sun disappears entirely for many winter weeks. Sounds like a buffet brunch for the ancient fanged cohorts, no? I mean, they don't have to worry about the sun, and there are hundreds of these weak humans running around in the dark. What's not to love!Problems quickly become evident as Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett,Lucky Number Slevin) runs into a sudden rash of crimes. All of the cell phones in town are discovered burned on a hillside. Every last sled dog is found murdered. The sole helicopter in town is found dismantled and destroyed. And a lone Stranger (Ben Foster,Hostage) wanders into town with gloom and doom surrounding him. This Stranger runs afoul of the local constabulary and is rushed to a jail cell ...which is when things really start going downhill for the people of Barrow.The last day of sun comes and goes, and a Russian ship sits idly in a hidden bay. Off this ship comes pure trouble. With no need to hide from the sun, these ancient vampires are free to roam and kill at their leisure. The people of Barrow are easy pickings.During all of the ensuing chaos, Sheriff Oleson is also battling a separation from his wife Stella (Melissa George,Dark City), who is forced to stay in Barrow after having an unfortunate car accident. It is her, her husband, and a small band of survivors who are the final holdouts within Barrow. Discovering that the only way to kill these vampires is to behead them, the Sheriff and his shrinking townspeople are forced to do the unthinkable, sometimes to friends who have been ""turned"" into vampires.The ending is a bit sappy but filmed pretty well. The psychological aspects of it are impressive considering what the Sheriff is forced to do in order to save the town and the wife he now loves again (who needs marriage counseling when you've got human-devouring bloodsuckers to worry about?)But this film isn't without its problems. From the very beginning, it is obvious that the film makers spent zero time researching how the sun sets above the arctic circle (it doesn't come straight down onto the horizon but slants into it at an extreme angle). And the sun doesn't stay up for long during the last day before it vanishes. It's probably up just a few moments before it sinks below the horizon again and is NEVER up very high in the sky.The acting is so-so with Hartnett pulling in an okay lead performance. Ben Foster as ""The Stranger"" is creepily menacing and filthy, enough to send a few shivers up your spine. The vampires themselves were the most interesting, their communication often being more of a clicking sound than words, and some of them looking almost neanderthal-ish, giving them a very ancient appearance.But the film is good in that it doesn't spoonfeed the audience any information. We're not exactly sure how old these vampires are, nor exactly how many are left (although it appears these are ""the last of their kind""). We're also never privy to the Sheriff and his wife's marital difficulties, it being internalized by the characters and only felt via them (which was quite refreshing ...we didn't need to know this information, only how they were going to survive for a month against these monsters).This is a gore-fest, too, with plenty of crimson for the hardcore horror fan. But it doesn't go over the top. Only one beheading is truly shown and it was a powerful scene meant to shock you. And, like the movie, it's an assault on your senses. A good assault, that is.",3,Not For The Romantic Vampire Fan,1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,4755,"['***WARNING', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***Looking', 'love', 'Ol', 'Toothy', 'Guy', 'Want', 'desirable', 'vampires', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'take', 'Dracula', 'best', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'true', 'blood-and-guts', 'horror', 'film', 'what', 'when', 'pay', 'cinema', 'ticket', '30', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'NIGHT.Director', 'David', 'Slade', 'ofHard', 'Candyfame', 'becoming', 'known', 'psychological', 'aspects', 'films', 'aforementioned', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'was', 'shockingly', 'excellent', 'story', 'turning', 'tables', 'again', 'again', 'pedophiliac', 'relationship', 'made', 'viewers', 'squirm', 'seats.And', 'here', 'again', 'Slade', 'can', 'jump', 'old', 'legend', 'put', 'new', 'spin', 'things', 'Vampire', 'movies', 'are', 'dime-a-dozen', 'most', 'severely', 'romanticizing', 'toothy', 'villains', 'Slade', 'sway', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'are', 'brutal', 'strong', 'extremely', 'old', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'fresh', 'meat', 'satiate', 'insatiable', 'hunger.The', 'unfortunate', 'victims', 'bloodthirst', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'Barrow', 'Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'geography', 'oil', 'knows', 'Barrow', 'top', 'world', 'cradled', 'edge', 'arctic', 'ocean', 'where', 'Alaskan', 'pipeline', 'dominant', 'feature', 'also', 'little', 'shanty-ish', 'town', 'well', 'arctic', 'circle', 'place', 'where', 'sun', 'entirely', 'many', 'winter', 'weeks', 'Sounds', 'buffet', 'brunch', 'ancient', 'fanged', 'cohorts', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'sun', 'are', 'hundreds', 'weak', 'humans', 'running', 'around', 'dark', 'What', 'not', 'love', 'Problems', 'quickly', 'become', 'evident', 'Sheriff', 'Eben', 'Oleson', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Lucky', 'Number', 'Slevin', 'sudden', 'rash', 'crimes', 'cell', 'phones', 'town', 'are', 'discovered', 'burned', 'hillside', 'last', 'sled', 'dog', 'found', 'murdered', 'sole', 'helicopter', 'town', 'found', 'dismantled', 'destroyed', 'lone', 'Stranger', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Hostage', 'town', 'gloom', 'doom', 'surrounding', 'Stranger', 'afoul', 'local', 'constabulary', 'rushed', 'jail', 'cell', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'going', 'downhill', 'people', 'Barrow.The', 'last', 'day', 'sun', 'Russian', 'ship', 'sits', 'idly', 'hidden', 'bay', 'ship', 'pure', 'trouble', 'need', 'hide', 'sun', 'ancient', 'vampires', 'are', 'free', 'roam', 'kill', 'leisure', 'people', 'Barrow', 'are', 'easy', 'pickings.During', 'ensuing', 'chaos', 'Sheriff', 'Oleson', 'also', 'battling', 'separation', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Melissa', 'George', 'Dark', 'City', 'who', 'forced', 'stay', 'Barrow', 'having', 'unfortunate', 'car', 'accident', 'husband', 'small', 'band', 'survivors', 'who', 'are', 'final', 'holdouts', 'Barrow', 'Discovering', 'only', 'way', 'kill', 'vampires', 'behead', 'Sheriff', 'shrinking', 'townspeople', 'are', 'forced', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'sometimes', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'vampires.The', 'ending', 'bit', 'sappy', 'filmed', 'pretty', 'well', 'psychological', 'aspects', 'are', 'impressive', 'considering', 'what', 'Sheriff', 'forced', 'do', 'order', 'save', 'town', 'wife', 'now', 'again', 'who', 'marriage', 'counseling', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'human-devouring', 'bloodsuckers', 'worry', 'film', ""n't"", 'problems', 'very', 'beginning', 'obvious', 'film', 'makers', 'spent', 'zero', 'time', 'researching', 'how', 'sun', 'sets', 'arctic', 'circle', ""n't"", 'come', 'straight', 'down', 'horizon', 'slants', 'extreme', 'angle', 'sun', ""n't"", 'stay', 'up', 'long', 'last', 'day', 'probably', 'up', 'just', 'few', 'moments', 'horizon', 'again', 'NEVER', 'up', 'very', 'high', 'sky.The', 'acting', 'so-so', 'Hartnett', 'pulling', 'okay', 'lead', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Stranger', 'creepily', 'menacing', 'filthy', 'enough', 'send', 'few', 'shivers', 'spine', 'vampires', 'were', 'most', 'interesting', 'communication', 'often', 'being', 'more', 'clicking', 'sound', 'words', 'looking', 'almost', 'neanderthal-ish', 'giving', 'very', 'ancient', 'film', 'good', ""n't"", 'spoonfeed', 'audience', 'information', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'how', 'old', 'vampires', 'are', 'exactly', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'left', 'are', 'last', 'kind', ""'re"", 'also', 'never', 'Sheriff', 'wife', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'being', 'internalized', 'characters', 'only', 'felt', 'was', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'information', 'only', 'how', 'were', 'going', 'survive', 'month', 'monsters', '.This', 'gore-fest', 'too', 'plenty', 'crimson', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'fan', ""n't"", 'go', 'top', 'Only', 'one', 'beheading', 'truly', 'shown', 'was', 'powerful', 'scene', 'meant', 'shock', 'movie', 'assault', 'senses', 'good', 'assault']",N/A

1128795,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B00111YM5Q,Brian A. Schar,"[1, 3]","""30 Days of Night"" starts off with some beautiful arctic cinematography and lighting that made me think that, just maybe, I might be in for a great movie.  However, after this auspicious beginning, ""30 Days of Night"" turns into a cliche-ridden film that looks and feels like a made-for-TV movie.  THe gorgeous cinematography of the first 3 minutes is eschwed for, well, something that looks like it belongs on CBS.  The Exposition gets revealed in a clunky way that left my wife and I saying, several times, ""hey, we're going to see that later.""For a town that's in 30 days of darkness, after the vampires cut the power, it's sure light outside!  I laughed out loud at one scene in the diner where it looked like the sun was shining through the thin, closed curtains ocer the windows.  You never get a sense that it's really cold outside, either.  I went to high school in Wisconsin and would routinely wait for the bus outside in winter when it was 0F or -10F, before the wind chill, and I was dressed far more warmly than our characters.  That lack of realism played against the suspension of disbelief.More importantly, this movie was just boring in the middle.  Rather than the intended cat-and-mouse game between the hunters and the prey, with quiet suspense and tension, the core of the movie is tedious and dull.  ""30 Days of Night"" is not only too long for its own good, but also runs out of steam in the middle, as if the writers couldn't figure out the second act.  Maybe they couldn't; three credited writers are always a warning sign that the script isn't going to be fantastic.  Adding to the boredom are the hoary old tropes of horror and made-for-TV movies.  There's the separated couple who is drawn together again by a crisis!  A prickly old local who's really a caring guy underneath!  The Sensitive Cop!  The sassy old lady!  And, these walking cliches perform the biggest horror movie cliche of all - they do stupid things, over and over again, for no reason other than it's in the script.  No one makes a good decision at any time in this movie.  Then, our hero does something that I still don't understand, and it's over.On the plus side, the vampires are not cutesy emo boys over which teens and tweens can swoon, but instead are grotesque killers with nothing romantic about them at all.  This plus doesn't outweigh all of the minuses.

The vampires were nicely done and the acting throughout is pretty good. The story line of Barrow, Alaska entering it's 30 days of night and being layed siege to by a group of vampires off a foreign freighter is pretty frightening. A small group of townspeople try to hide until the Sun returns. Using guerilla tactics they are able to get weapons, food, and find shelter. I was impressed and found the acting so good I actually became attached to a couple characters. The directing and camera were good as well. The set crew did a great job creating a believeble small town in Alaska. Overall if you enjoy horror you will probably want to give this one a try.

graphic novel/comic book junkie,so I can tell you without a shred of doubt,that this movie was missing something;something I couldn't quite put my finger on at first.That was until it was pointed it out to me by my horror buddy........You never got the impression that these people were trapped for any length of time.Everywhere they hid, it felt like they were there for mere minutes, not days.It lacked that utterly ""trapped feeling"" that most zombie films so accurately portray.It never felt like they were cut-off from civilization for 30 days,It felt more like 2 or 3 days tops.There was never any sense of dread or despair,something that should have been paramount in this kind of flick,something that a movie like ""The Mist"" depicted perfectly.The pandemonium in the streets should have been an integral part of the film as well,the creme de la creme,and yet it was glossed over, and reduced to a momentary overhead shot.Individual struggles against the vampires would have been a necessary addition too,especially to invoke a personal sense of horror.Sadly there were very few, if any of these.There also should have been a heavier emphasis on the ""silence factor""(The vampires have accute hearing,so the survivors had to keep perfectly still & silent in the graphic novels)Instead of taking all this into consideration,the director & the special effects team opted to waaay over-use the Raimi pulley technique.Something that became tired very early on in the film.(I don't think vampires are going to drag EVERYBODY by their legs)The deaths-scenes also left much to be desired.The vampire were savage,so the death scenes should have matched that savagery pound for pound.Alot more throat tearing would have been in order.The films only saving grace,was the multiple-chop decapitation performed by Josh Hartnet.This flick honestly needed another half hour to heighten the tension.The lack of dread, horror, fear, and despair is what ultimately killed this movie.So as per my wife, I dub this film, ""30 Minutes of Night""**NOTE**In most cases the movie is never as good as the material it's trying to replicate.That's not the case here though.The graphic novel was equally as disappointing,but then again, I say that only because the story felt VERY rushed,& the art was god-awful.As the series continued, it got better, the story I mean...not the art.There WAS an entire segment of the graphic novel however, that the movie shrugged off.But in retrospect it was probably alot better off without it.MORAL OF THE STORY:Monster have to eat too",3,30

I happened to have loved it.I read all the graphic novels before seeing this, and was skeptical that they could pull off the stark terror, the coldness of isolation, and the feeling of utter helplessness the novels are made up of. When your eyes feast upon the artwork in them you can see smell, hear and taste that bright and dark blood splattered all over that blue and white city of barrow. The filmmakers captured that visual, and that's part of why this movie worked for me.I don't go into movies like this, as other reviewers have, wanting my hand to be held. I don't NEED an explanation for everything; I don't puzzle on the why where and wherefore art thou. It's magic to let yourself be free to believe your eyes, and leave your quizzical mind on the shelf for 90 minutes. The people who obsess on the details usually get left behind on the fun.AND 30 days of night is pure fun, to someone like me who loves the myth of the vampire. I love that they were more animal than humanistic, that they spoke in some weird Amazonian dialect or just grunts and screeches at times. The town of Barrow and its inhabitants aren't just a fast food stop to them, they are ecstatic that they get to play with their food for 30 days interrupted.

1128803,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,B00111YM5Q,C. Chow,"[2, 2]","The vampire genre can provide for some great literature or some truly awful films. The humans vs. vampires or zombies genre has been beaten to death. Until now! '30 Days of Night' provides for a breathtaking amount of visually terrifying life and death suspense.Based on the graphic novel of the same title '30 Days of Night' takes place entirely in an Alaskan frontier town which annually experiences 30 days without the sun. This reduces the population to just over 150. This gives a gang of Eastern European vampires 30 days to openly drink the town dry.The film is brilliant in the way it builds tension. First off the setting of a dark ghost town covered in snow could not be more frightening. Light is scarce and shadows everywhere give the villains plenty of places to lurk. Anything could pop out over everywhere. The DVD reveals the set was in fact a New Zealand equestrian center.Much like `Die Hard 2' the film builds the fear of total inescapable chaos slowly with tragic events building on each other. It's not just ""Hello we're here we're the vampires."" No, the fear comes from not knowing what is coming. Hartnett and his one deputy don't realize what is happening until it is too late. The fear comes slowly as transportation and communications are eliminated by the mysterious drifter. He's creepy and we shudder to wonder where he came from as the town is surrounded by ice.The vampires themselves are truly horrifying as they do not look like Anne Rice's disco queens or `Buffy's' rubber masked punks. No, these vampires are Nosferatu except worse. Their faces are white and everything else, eyes, hair, and clothing is black. The only color being the blood on their teeth adds to the fear. Much like the cast of `Name of the Rose' they scrounged Europe for the scariest looking before makeup actors they could find. Danny Huston is an unforgettable villain.The vampires are so inhuman they even speak their own vampire language far scarier than `Blade.' Although most of the time they communicate with chilling sketches. Their movement is also supernatural and inhuman.Most effective of all the vampires are hard to kill. We truly fear for our band of heroes. How can humans hope to fight these things? This adds tremendously to the plot as we cannot imagine what will happen. Don't the good guys have to win? Or at least take the bad guys with them? Anything is possible.While we do get a couple of vampires being bisected by John Deere, incinerated by a UV light, caught in a meat grinder, and a little girl decapitated by a fire ax, the film does not disappoint in its premise that a band of mortals is no match for these vampires. This is summed up perfectly with the classic line, ""Just because something worked on Bela Lugosi doesn't mean it will work on these guys.""We do not suffer the token clips of chair legs being carved into stakes, crucifixes being taken down from walls, or Bibles being used to make holy water.David Slade has truly created a visual masterpiece that like a horror film should, uses visuals and sounds to frighten. Not just entertain.The only downside is that Josh Hartnett as always still suffers from Down syndrome.

The storyline was simple and direct: vampires invade a town that is cut off from the rest of the world, and to boot its dark for 30 days straight. So it makes sense why the vamps attack the area, and how they do it. Someone walking into the showing w/out knowing it's a vampire attack might just think that the killings are a gang of drug junkies, or a serial killer invading the town. The killings aren't your usual vampire fare: no stupid ""we have bodies drained of blood, w/ two puncture marks on the side of the neck"".  These bodies are torn apart and look like animals or crazy people did it. The gore that's shown is meant to horrify you, and make you realize just what these poor folk are up against. No one deserved to die the way these victims did.  It's not romanticized in any way. No one is dying while being bitten ""romantically"" in the neck, in the throes of domination--these vamps tear you apart, and it's brutal and vicious. You had real personality types who could really exist, and whose purpose was to make you both feel for the townsfolk, and wonder who was going to be the one who gets himself or other people killed. While the survivors were holed up, the ""frontiersman"" and Alzheimer's sufferer were both in positions where they could have given away the position of the survivors, and their scenes left you wondering, ""Oh my God, if they keep screaming and shouting, they're going to get caught.""  There were real-life circumstances about family, and survival, and what YOU would do if you were in that situation, (for instance, there was one scene where a parent kills their entire family to avoid being caught by the vamps). This is what a horror movie is all about: helplessness and hope. You don't need nudity (which this movie had none), or gore for gore's sake (had none of that either).  You need hope. You want the townspeople to survive, even the prickly ones who got on your nerves. And you watch the movie to figure out how.

It was nice to actually see them as creatures as beasts ripping apart and feasting. The vampires in this movie yell out a horrifing streak when they see a human which makes them that much cooler. If you like gore then this movie has plenty of it and I mean plenty. Story wise it's very weak the concepts of the vampires is good but I was expecting much more from this movie. This movie is suppose to take place in a whole month but it feels like one night. You never see the survivors sleep or complain about being cold or to actually eat a meal much less drink some water. This movie could have been so much more but it just feels like it was rushed. The story seems very thin and a lot of questions not answered.

1128811,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00111YM5Q,Chris Pandolfi,"[13, 16]","I can't think of a better location for vampires than above the Arctic Circle, where it's not only perpetually cold, but it also goes through long periods with little to no sunlight. In ""30 Days of Night,"" a pack of vampires take over an isolated Alaskan town, one that's located so far north, the sun will periodically disappear for weeks at a time. Where these vampires came from is anyone's guess, but considering the entertainingly graphic nature of this movie, I don't think anyone will care. ""30 Days of Night""--based on the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith--definitely delivers as a tense, horrifying experience, and it achieves this not only through its intensity, but also through its originality. That being said, I'm not quite sure how I should feel about its tone; despite a number of frightening moments, this movie is brooding and subdued, about as cold and distant as the plot-specific town of Barrow, Alaska.This also applies to the characters, most of which are pretty monotone and depressing. Even when the occasional joke is told, one doesn't sense the humor that's supposed to go along with it. Then again, is there really a bright side (no pun intended) to living in a freezing, irregularly seasoned climate? These people have to travel over thirty miles to reach the nearest neighboring city, and I can't imagine how long it takes to receive mail or even basic supplies. In some ways, this movie is scary enough because of its location; the vampires are only the icing on the cake. And let's keep in mind that these vampires are not of the classically sexualized variety, the lustful, gothic figures replaced by primal, ugly beasts. Their facial features are grotesque and animalistic, with sharp, carnivorous teeth serving as fangs. Their mouths, chins, and necks are always covered in blood, and when they're not making inhuman sounds, they speak to each other in an ancient vampire tongue.Their presence in Barrow was foreshadowed by the arrival of a mysterious stranger (Ben Foster), a man so ominous that the town sheriff, Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett), wastes no time in arresting him and locking him behind bars. ""Bar the windows,"" says the stranger from his cell. ""Try to hide. They're comin'."" Funny he should mention that, considering Eben has been investigating acts of vandalism against Barrow's escape methods: every sled dog is slaughtered; the helicopter engines are torn apart; the power and phone lines are severed. The locals soon begin disappearing, and soon after, many are openly attacked in their homes. Clearly, the stranger knew this was going to happen, meaning that he's somehow connected with the vampires. The details are never really given, but then again, I suppose they don't need to be.As the population falls victim to a vampire epidemic, the survivors band together, hoping to stay safe by moving from place to place. Eben is especially protective of his wife, Stella (Melissa George) and his fifteen-year-old brother, Jake (Mark Rendall), and both add a touch of humanity to the story. Not that a great deal is learned--marital problems between Eben and Stella is hinted at, and one gets the sense that the age difference between Eben and Jake has caused some conflict. I can't help but wonder if anything more could have been developed. Yes, I understand that this is a horror film and that it's not meant to be meaningful or complex. Still, when a close-knit community is involved, I just know that a wealth of material is just waiting to be explored.This isn't to say that ""30 Days of Night"" isn't effective. Quite the opposite; it creatively reinvents the vampire movie, veering away from the clich&eacute;s of crucifixes, wooden stakes, and garlic. None of those are even alluded to, although there is a moment when a character says something to the effect of, ""What worked on Bela Lugosi may not work for us."" In this case, a few well-placed chops with an axe will get the job done. That, and the light of the sun, which the locals of Barrow are eagerly awaiting. If they can survive the month, then they can reclaim their town.But that won't be so easy. The vampires have vowed to destroy Barrow, and their plan culminates with an oil spill from the town's pipeline. This paves the way for the film's final sequences, which unfold in particularly interesting way. I obviously can't elaborate on that, but I will say that, in a good way, the ending is not quite what I expected it to be. Credit has to be given for a vampire film that truly wants to be original--""30 Days of Night"" pumps fresh blood (again, no pun intended) into the horror genre, and while not as structurally developed as it could have been, it still manages to be entertaining, engaging, and above all, frightening. This is especially true of the end credit sequence, one of the creepiest I've ever seen.",4,Looking for Blood in All the Dark Places,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,4850,"['ca', ""n't"", 'think',

1128815,A1DBQOB2CVLDOS,B00111YM5Q,"Chris Van Deelen ""Chris Van Deelen""","[0, 0]","There really isn't anything new under the sun when it comes to vampire movies today. Honestly, how many different ways can you portray vampires? Poor victims that must feed off the living in order to maintain their existence?  Sexy, dark, mysterious individuals who have embraced their immortality?  Murderous monsters?We've seen all the various portrayals of these undead creatures throughout the years in both theatrical releases and on the small screen.I guess it all comes down to how the story is presented. And I must say that 30 days of night is a rather refreshing take on the whole genre.The premise is very simple. A small and very remote Alaskan town is getting ready for a month without the sun. More than half the population of this town has already left for the south in order to escape this month of darkness.The remainder hunker down for this long, lonely time.However, unbeknownst to them, their small town has become the target of a group of ravenous vampires, who send in a quisling in order to cut them off from any potential help and to ensure that their month of feeding will not be disturbed.Once the attack begins, it is a game of cat and mouse, with the vampires alternately slaughtering the townsfolk to playing with them before killing them, and eventually using a few as bait in order to bring the few that have somehow managed to evade their attacks out of hiding.The other interesting thing about the movie was the vampires themselves. Dare I say that they would have fit the bill `Euro trash' to the hilt. As undead monsters, they cared nothing for the cold, and little in regards to their appearance.These creatures of the night had absolutely no redeeming qualities what so ever. Sure, there have been movies in the past where you could almost feel for the creatures, look upon them as victims, but not in this flick!The gore wasn't that major an issue for me. Lots of blood, but it didn't really go over the top until near the end. Even then, at least it wasn't over the top like SAW or Hostel.I must say that the ending did take me by surprise, and it was sad, but very well done, and I wouldn't have it any other way.The movie did suffer from a few continuity flaws, and there were things about it that simply defied logic.For example - now power, no heat. It gets deathly cold up there! They would have frozen to death long before the sun returned.Also, at the beginning of the movie, they were on the shore, watching the sun set for the final time in 30 days. Then they were back at that same spot at the end of the movie. As far as I know, the sun rises in the east and settles in the west.Still, other than these minor quibbles, I enjoyed the movie and recommend to others to see it.As for bonus features, you have the typical audio commentary with stars Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, and producer Rob Tapert.Included as well are 8 featurettes - pre production, building barrow, the look, blood, guts & nasty @#$%, stunts, the vampire, night shoots and casting.Finally, one neat added bonus feature is the first episode of the anime vampire series Blood +. I'm not a huge fan of anime by any stretch of the imagination, although I do like some and this series, despite being anime, caught my interest.

However I was impressed to see that it was not a total let down. I own the comic book that the movie originated from, and of course the comic book was way better, as they usually are. I was very grateful for the way the vampires looked, pretty much the exact duplicate of the comic. The film had some good scenes of blood and gore,(scenes of beheading are always fun). The tension was not what it should have been, there were moments. But the whole comic book was intense. The atmosphere was creepy and the writing was good. The acting was good except some times it came off a bit forced. I did enjoy the ending.In Barrow, Alaska they have one month out of the year that it stays dark for 30 days. As darkness approaches the villagers find themselves being attacked by unknown forces. It doesn't take the town long to find out they are being hunted by blood sucking vampires. Unable to escape since the airport has been shut down until sunrise and the vampires have destroyed all connections leading outside of town, the only means of surviving is to hide and wait for 30 days of night to be over. Unfortunately the small towns people need food and supplies to last them 30 days. They have to create diversions and truck through the blizzard and freezing cold in hopes of trying to dodge the nasty, vicious creatures of the night. Who will survive and who will fall prey to the night that surrounds them?The difference between watching a movie and reading a book(even one with pictures) is that your mind creates a much more terrible scenrio than the film could ever live up to. So most of the time when you end up watching a movie that is based on a book, you are disappointed. Because what you thought up in your mind isn't at all the same as what you just watched. I do think that if the 30 Days Of Night had been original it would have been a alot better release. Another problem of the film was the unnecessary length. All in all it wasn't a terrible watch.

1128819,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00111YM5Q,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","Despite being known in horror lore as vicious and bloodsucking, vampires lately have been more romanticized with brooding and psychological issues. Enter 30 Days of Night which at least brings vampires to the forefront by being violent, relentless and most of all, cunning. These aren't the walk/run zombies who can't even figure out how to open doors but know how to get to their prey or even lure them out. With that premise and story, plus Hard Candy director David Slade and graphic novel source material, seems like we should be getting a better film than we got, right?In the town of Barrow, Alaska, there's a time period where the sun literally does not come up for roughly 30 days, leaving a constant feeling of nighttime. Sheriff Eben Oleson finds all the town's sled dogs killed, cell phones burned and destroyed and the only helicopter out of town useless. When he finds out separated wife Stella is stuck in town, Eben isn't thrilled about that either but things go from bad to worse when a ship is seen off a nearby bay and a strange man comes into town telling the town of an evil coming towards them: one who hates sunlight and a thirst for blood.One reviewer marked once that something is bad for what it is and one's bad because of what it doesn't have. 30 Days of Night is similar because the premise ultimately works but the execution is off while some things that would've added to the tension are ultimately missing. Things such as logic holes are common in horror films but there's some in here where it gets you wondering how dumb people can get. Title cards will show up stating how many days have passed yet you don't really feel it in the characters' faces or psyches. Where's that fear and paranoia of possibly being killed or how crazy you can get being cooped up, bored, and hunted? Here? They're just tired and hungry and cold.David Slade previously directed Hard Candy which combined great acting with a strong sense of tension. The acting here is partially a step up but still the same ol'. There's a bit more emphasis on character relationships and quieter moments but then it turns into a gorefest and characters get unceremoniously bumped off and some characters, such as an Alzheimer's sufferer and his son really only play the one persona before being bumped while one character doesn't have much of a backstory aside from ""this is who I am"" stuff. It is a shame but with a film concerned more with vampire violence, the bloodletting and character moments make it strangely dichotic.Part of me wants to recommend the film while the other half can think of other horror films that are better made.

Monk ""CM""","[1, 1]","The film is good though it does have some holes and leaves something to be desired.It's an interesting take on the vampire legend though these aren't your typical Dracula-type vampires.  These are brutal monsters who, instead of killing a single victim here or there, prefer to descend on an entire town and slaughter everyone.  These aren't your Ann Rice vampires; pretty boy sex symbols, no these vampires are ugly and horrible beings.I won't go into too much of the plot but this paragraph contains spoilers.  Some of the film doesn't make sense.  Like when the sheriff is driving around town when the first night of attacks are occurring.  There is an overview scene where the vampires are in the streets attacking people, dragging them from their homes, etc.  How is the sheriff able to get around without getting into trouble?  Finally, he arrives at the diner where other survivors are hiding.  Here again is another problem...in that overview scene, you see vampires going into homes and dragging people out yet they don't even go after the people in the diner?  I mean the diner seemed to be centrally located in the town with only glass windows between them and the people they were trying to feed on.  These things are slightly annoying but don't detract from the movie too much.  There are other parts of the film that are never explained or never wrapped up (obviously to leave room for the usual horror film sequel).Spoilers end.This film is enjoyable and there were a few times that make you jump.  The atmosphere is great; Barrow Alaska, completely cut off during the month when they get almost no sun (the film did make it seem like it was an instant event...one day you could see the sun, the next, complete darkness).  But add to that the element of brutal vampires and it's a great setting, very original.As you might imagine, there's plenty of gore and blood and scenes of brutal killings by the vampires.  There's no nudity or sex scenes which is unusual given the current state of the horror genre and I must say it was quite refreshing.  There is some strong language but it's not too much that it distracts from the film.I'd love to give this movie a higher rating but I just didn't like the way it ended...to me it seemed too neat or too cliched.  And because of some of the problems and plot holes.  This is an enjoyable film if you like this sort of genre.

The vampires themselves are by far the best thing the film has going for it and the over the top blood & gore makes it a  definite keeper. My biggest problem with this one though is actor Josh Hartnett. He seems to be over acting throughout the movie and if there is one thing that I can't stand while watching a big-budget film it's when one of the main characters keeps reminding me that I'm watching a movie. I truly belive that this film could've been far better with a different lead. Don't get me wrong I was a little shocked myself with Hartnett's acting in this film, simply because he's been pretty good in just about everything else I've seen him in. I don't know what happend here though. The only other problem I found was the films predictability, but that's always expected to a dagree with films like these.

The vampires come to town and the human inhabitants do what they can to survive.  A great deal of screen time is spent on action sequences so we are not getting lengthy dissertations on character history or the arctic ecology or the quirky Tarentino impulse of the moment, or even the likelihood of the supernatural turning out to be real.  A fair number of people are made into snacks before they quite know what hit them.  And by the time the primary players realize they are under assault by creatures out of myth and legend they are all keenly aware that, in any case, people are dying and the odds look quite grim.There is an entertaining if implausible scene where a piece of construction equipment is used rather like an over-sized chain saw.  Bear traps are also used to good effect.  And a piece of machinery that makes the wood chipper in Fargo seem like small potatoes.The vampires themselves are something of a mixed bag.  I like the visuals.  I like the teeth and the claws.  I'm not so impressed by the vampires' penchant for standing around and hissing at one another, or at the humans, much as other reviewers have noted.  Language is also a problem.  The vampires don't speak very much, and when they do it's not English.  I haven't read anything of the fiction the film is based on so I would just be taking a wild guess in saying the vampires seem a little ""eastern European.""  And so the few lines of actual dialogue spoken by the lead vampire are translated via sub-titles.  This led me to misconstruing the following:  ""It took us centuries...to make them believe...we are only bad dreams.""  These 3 segments come on separate screens and thus I took the first two segments as one sentence, and the third bit as a sentence of its own.  Colored me briefly confused.Also, the vampires are apparently unconcerned with being drenched in blood for days on end, which, ok, they're ravenous monsters, but they still have to look at each other, and presumably they still have to masquerade as humans from time to time, so you'd think that at some point during the 30 days of the film they might pick up a few handfuls of snow and at least make an attempt at washing the blood from their faces.Perhaps the most singular role in the film was that taken by Ben Foster, in giving us a kind of modern-day Renfield, who, alas, eats no bugs, though he succeeds in seeming delightfully creepy.  There is also one very youthful actress by the name of Abbey-May Wakefield who gets to show some chops in a scene as chilling as any in the whole film.30 Days is no Underworld, and neither is it a Near Dark, or The Addiction, but if you're in the mood for an old-school vampire yarn it's definitely worth a try.",3,For the Vampire Genre....not bad.,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,3034,"['like', 'vampires', 'vampire', 'flicks', 'should', 'find', '30', 'Days', 'be', 'least', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'only', 'are', 'not', 'wedded', 'notion', 'vampire', 'cuddly', 'teenage', 'heartthrob.Make', 'mistake', 'vampires', 'film', 'are', 'definitely', 'old', 'school', 'vicious', 'ravenous', 'predatory.The', 'plot', 'quite', 'slim', 'vampires', 'come', 'town', 'human', 'inhabitants', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'survive', 'great', 'deal', 'screen', 'time', 'spent', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'lengthy', 'dissertations', 'character', 'history', 'arctic', 'ecology', 'quirky', 'Tarentino', 'impulse', 'moment', 'even', 'likelihood', 'supernatural', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'fair', 'number', 'people', 'are', 'made', 'snacks', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'hit', 'time', 'primary', 'players', 'realize', 'are', 'assault', 'creatures', 'myth', 'legend', 'are', 'keenly', 'aware', 'case', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'odds', 'look', 'quite', 'grim.There', 'entertaining', 'implausible', 'scene', 'where', 'piece', 'construction', 'equipment', 'used', 'rather', 'over-sized', 'chain', 'saw', 'Bear', 'traps', 'are', 'also', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'piece', 'machinery', 'wood', 'chipper', 'Fargo', 'seem', 'small', 'potatoes.The', 'vampires', 'are', 'something', 'mixed', 'bag', 'visuals', 'teeth', 'claws', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'impressed', 'vampires', 'penchant', 'standing', 'around', 'hissing', 'one', 'humans', 'much', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Language', 'also', 'problem', 'vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'very', 'much', 'when', 'do', 'not', 'English', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'anything', 'fiction', 'film', 'based', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'taking', 'wild', 'guess', 'saying', 'vampires', 'seem', 'little', 'eastern', 'European', 'so', 'few', 'lines', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'lead', 'vampire', 'are', 'translated', 'sub-titles', 'led', 'misconstruing', 'following', 'took', 'centuries', 'make', 'believe', 'are', 'only', 'bad', 'dreams', '3', 'segments', 'come', 'separate', 'screens', 'thus', 'took', 'first', 'two', 'segments', 'one', 'sentence', 'third', 'bit', 'sentence', 'own', 'Colored', 'briefly', 'confused.Also', 'vampires', 'are', 'apparently', 'unconcerned', 'being', 'drenched', 'blood', 'days', 'end', 'ok', ""'re"", 'ravenous', 'monsters', 'still', 'have', 'look', 'other', 'presumably', 'still', 'have', 'masquerade', 'humans', 'time', 'time', ""'d"", 'think', 'point', '30', 'days', 'film', 'might', 'pick', 'up', 'few', 'handfuls', 'snow', 'least', 'make', 'attempt', 'washing', 'blood', 'faces.Perhaps', 'most', 'singular', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'taken', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'giving', 'kind', 'modern-day', 'Renfield', 'who', 'alas', 'bugs', 'seeming', 'delightfully', 'creepy', 'also', 'one', 'very', 'youthful', 'actress', 'name', 'Abbey-May', 'Wakefield', 'who', 'show', 'chops', 'scene', 'as', 'chilling', 'whole', 'film.30', 'Days', 'Underworld', 'Near', 'Dark', 'Addiction', ""'re"", 'mood', 'old-school', 'vampire', 'yarn', 'definitely', 'worth', 'try']",N/A

1128833,A9NCQGVV5W8N0,B00111YM5Q,"darklordzden ""darklordzden""","[0, 3]","Let me start off on the pros: the cinematography was beautiful (the shot of the familiar walking away from the Ice Breaker at the start was amazing) and the vampires themselves were amongst the most stunning I've ever seen. Truth be told, I found myself sitting there wishing that they had used the vampires from '30 Days Of Night' inI Am Legend (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)- If they'd done that and changed that travesty of an ending to something closer to the Matheson's novel, it would have been a film classic - also, the set-piece with the big Grizzly Adams bloke running amok in the ice-cutter thing was a joy to behold.Now the cons: There was absolutely no sense of menace, suspense, pace or development of the characters. This was surprising as David Slade's previous outing,Hard Candy, was an exemplary exercise in all of the above. John Carpenter once observed that he structuredHalloweenalong the lines ofHigh Noon- the first two acts were build up, the third was the arrival of the protagonist. Slade should've observed this rule and taken his time. At least the first act and three quarters should've been used to establish a sense of menace surrounding the as-yet-unseen vampire's arrival. In a film of this nature, with a few exceptions, its always necessary to introduce your characters and then slowly establish your sense of menace. To my mind, this should've been at least the first forty minutes to one hour of screen-time.  Also, in a film like this, you have to be invested in the characters so that you can get a reaction from the audience when you kill them off. To use Carpenter as a template again, Look at what he does inThe Thing (Collector's Edition): you subtly observe the minutiae of the lives and foibles of the occupants of Outpost 31 in great detail before the horror begins. You get to know the men as something other than ciphers so that when the grisly stuff does begin, its a kidney punch. I also think Josh Hartnett was completely miscast. I think the guy has the emotional range of a block of wood - what you needed for the lead was an actor who could convey both a growing sense of fear, a resolve to protect his charges and then - once the town of 'Barrow' has been beseiged - a sense of rage at his own failure and vulnerability, coupled with suppressed survivor guilt, all of which will eventually lead him to make the decision that he does.Also, an unwritten rule of successful survival horror movies is that you don't want your audience to relate to the villains as anything other than an unremitting force because it detracts from the audience becoming invested in the characters that are under attack - It's for this reason that I think it was a colossal mistake giving the vampires their own scenes outside of their interactions with the human characters.In the end, the overall impression that I took away from this movie was that it was a technical exercise that was as cold, empty and sterile as the Alaskan wastes.",2,Beautifully Shot But Completely Devoid Of Humanity,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,2972,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'pros', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'shot', 'familiar', 'walking', 'away', 'Ice', 'Breaker', 'start', 'was', 'amazing', 'vampires', 'were', 'amongst', 'most', 'stunning', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'found', 'sitting', 'there', 'wishing', 'had', 'used', 'vampires', ""'30"", 'Days', 'Night', 'inI', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Widescreen', 'Single-Disc', 'Edition', ""'d"", 'done', 'changed', 'travesty', 'ending', 'something', 'closer', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'classic', 'also', 'set-piece', 'big', 'Grizzly', 'Adams', 'bloke', 'running', 'amok', 'ice-cutter', 'thing', 'was', 'joy', 'behold.Now', 'cons', 'was', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'menace', 'suspense', 'pace', 'development', 'characters', 'was', 'surprising', 'David', 'Slade', 'previous', 'outing', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'was', 'exemplary', 'exercise', 'above', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'once', 'observed', 'structuredHalloweenalong', 'lines', 'Noon-', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'were', 'build', 'up', 'third', 'was', 'arrival', 'protagonist', 'Slade', 'should', ""'ve"", 'observed', 'rule', 'taken', 'time', 'least', 'first', 'act', 'three', 'quarters', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', 'establish', 'sense', 'menace', 'surrounding', 'as-yet-unseen', 'vampire', 'arrival', 'film', 'nature', 'few', 'exceptions', 'always', 'necessary', 'introduce', 'characters', 'then', 'slowly', 'establish', 'sense', 'menace', 'mind', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'least', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'one', 'hour', 'screen-time', 'Also', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'invested', 'characters', 'can', 'get', 'reaction', 'audience', 'when', 'kill', 'off', 'use', 'Carpenter', 'template', 'again', 'Look', 'what', 'inThe', 'Thing', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'subtly', 'observe', 'minutiae', 'lives', 'foibles', 'occupants', 'Outpost', '31', 'great', 'detail', 'horror', 'get', 'know', 'men', 'something', 'other', 'ciphers', 'so', 'when', 'grisly', 'stuff', 'begin', 'kidney', 'punch', 'also', 'think', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'was', 'completely', 'miscast', 'think', 'guy', 'emotional', 'range', 'block', 'wood', 'what', 'needed', 'lead', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'convey', 'growing', 'sense', 'fear', 'resolve', 'protect', 'charges', 'then', 'once', 'town', ""'Barrow"", 'been', 'beseiged', 'sense', 'rage', 'own', 'failure', 'vulnerability', 'coupled', 'suppressed', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'will', 'eventually', 'lead', 'make', 'decision', 'unwritten', 'rule', 'successful', 'survival', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'audience', 'relate', 'villains', 'anything', 'other', 'unremitting', 'force', 'audience', 'becoming', 'invested', 'characters', 'are', 'attack', 'reason', 'think', 'was', 'colossal', 'mistake', 'giving', 'vampires', 'own', 'scenes', 'interactions', 'human', 'end', 'overall', 'impression', 'took', 'away', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'technical', 'exercise', 'was', 'cold', 'empty', 'sterile', 'Alaskan', 'wastes']",N/A
1128834,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00111YM5Q,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[19, 33]","It's gotta be tough to be a vampire.I mean, seriously, give up a little sympathy for the Devil, man: how would you like to be hungry, just starved you know?---ready and raring to chomp into a little rare tenderloin, only to have the thing fight back? Or having to impale a rebellious little slice of yellowtail on a razored chopstick before flipping the sushi down your gullet?Or have your big fat greasy double cheesburger with the works beg you for mercy?Or even worse, Eternal Life?Man, that would kill anybody's appetite.So you'd think David Slade would have a little mercy on the ultimate Out-of-Towners who gate crash the sleepy little Alaska town of Barrow on the very day the sun sets Way Oop North for a month: a traveling band of vampires from the Lower 49. These guys just show up, hit the power station and the diner, and do what gawky tourists do: wear funny clothes, sport stupid haircuts, talk in funny accents, meet strange & interesting people, rip their heads off, gut them, and drain them of their blood.What's the big deal? The big deal is that director David Slade and his stable of writers manage to pull off the near fantastic: they take the awesome concept of Steve Niles's graphic novel and make it into a snoozer.The flick is bad, of course, but it's not even ambitious enough to be terrible: it's just tedious. I've had more exciting evenings filing taxes. If you've seen the trailer, then you've seen a better movie than this turdito burrito: all the pleasure (with a dastardly, moody little theme) with none of the House of Pain that is this king-sized cinematic floater.After the vamps show up, this is how every single scene plays out. Ready? Got a pencil? Here it is:1) Vampire wanders out onto the sidewalk, looks up at the sky, and hisses.2) Humans flee.3) Vamp sorta wanders after them, then gets distracted (bored?) and wanders off.4) Humans hole up in attic/hospital/office/store. Humans look very worried. Very very worried faces in close-up. Humans whisper.5) Josh Hartnett (Sheriff Eben) announces ""we can't stay here for very long---we've gotta keep moving"" in a stage whisper. Humans move to next location.Rinse. Repeat. Occasionally the whole huddle/whisper/whine/worry/hustle-it cycle is interrupted by a vampire wandering out on the street and hissing at the sky. Aside from absolutely zero character development---which I could forgive, if Slade gave me any suspense---it gets a little annoying when, about the 9th time Hartnett announces they gotta keep moving, you've realized the vampires aren't really knocking themselves out looking for anybody.The vamps are sort of amusing, though. They're not frightening in the least, something they share with the rest of the flick, which, powerless to terrify, tries to repulse. The Vampires look like the winners of England's Ugliest Bartender contest, with fashion catered by the Islamic Republic of Iran. They get Old Fast, chiefly because Slade gives them nothing interesting to say or do. That said, I started to empathize with the vampires, because they and I had something in common during this movie: they started out all jazzed up, and got REALLY SLEEPY AND SLOW. Possibly it was mild mental retardation. By the end of this thing, I could relate.That's about it. Slade jettisons what little plot there was in Nile's original (which would have worked just fine) and gives us what we obviously really want: a bunch of leached-out shots of ugly, worried people huddled together in an attic. If that's your idea of a great time, baby, then knock yourself out. I'd rather pull my own spleen out and eat it.Some will say this is a pretty looking flick, and it's true: like most things Evil, it looks great. Hell, the Nazis all looked pretty when they got all dolled up. Slade knows how to frame a shot, no doubt, and ""30 Days"" is chock full of eye-candy, including a mesmerizing opening shot of a beached, frozen cargo ship that tortured me with agonizing hints of what might have been.But pretty is as pretty does, and a turd in a cake is still a turd.

Since Lionsgate isn't going give up on the torture-for-pay franchise and I lost interest in the series after ""III"", the only theatrical horror movie that's intriguing for my spooky tradition is the ""Halloween"" remake, or at least it would've been if it wasn't released early back in late August (smooth move, Weinstein bros.).  ""30 Days in Night"" was my other by-recommendation alternative, a movie in which Josh Hartnett fights against foreign vampires.  As absurd as that idea is, and being produced by a company that makes mediocre spookfests, it turns out to be the best vampire film the new millennium has to offer so far.Now I can whine about the meteorological implausibility regarding a month-long night-fest in a small town in Alaska, but it won't change the fact that that's basically the setting of the story.  With that regard, along with its scarce resources and dwindling population, the town folks probably believe things couldn't get any worse...inconvenient for them (and convenient for the viewers), there was an import ship containing a few vampires some miles away.  Once the vamps discovered their haven, I've been treated to watching one of the most blood-tastic massacres in horror cinema, with the quality that New Zealand's Weta Workshop is known for.  To Josh Hartnett and the rest of cast, it's a jungle of frozen hell; to the vampires, it's a long-awaiting vacation spot w/ the humans being pi&ntilde;a coladas.Like a cross between Dracula and the Chiroptera fromBlood: The Last Vampire, those vampires are different kind of breed.  In contrast with the beauty, charm, and elegance from the past blood-suckers, the vampires in this movie are ugly, stark, and primal.  These vampires don't have to bite you to quench their thirst; they can just gnaw your neck off.  That's what so cool and frightful about them, because they are truly monstrous.  I also like that they didn't make a visible appearance right from the start; they were just silhouettes killing a few people until they show their faces right before they have their all-you-can-eat buffet. In all honestly, these are the vampires I want to fear.Vampires hunting and slaughtering wouldn't be as exciting if the humans weren't trying to stay out of their sights.  The survival aspect of the film is definitely the most compelling.  Josh Hartnett's character, his wife Stella, his brother and some forgettable cannon-fodders spend most of the time hiding in different homes until the sun comes up after 30 days, which during the time will consists of melodramatic character-development.  While some of these moments halt the film's momentum, they do build up the intensity and concern over how they're going to stay alive.  Not only are the vampires strong, they are also quite clever: they took out the electricity and even use an injured person as bait to draw more humans in, so they know what they're doing.After reaching such a satisfying climax, I was hoping the ending would be more fulfilling.  Instead, I've been treated to a ""'Blade II""-like ending, which in all respects is necessary, but after everything that's happened, the finale was rather middling.  There was also a matter of being rather unfinished, but then it may be purely intentional to leave open for an inevitable, most-likely-inferior sequel.Until I've actually seenJohn Carpenter's chilling masterpiece, I am legitimate to say ""30 Days of Night"" is the best horror film taking place in a snowy environment ever made.  I'm not saying it's an excellent movie, but the movie follows the essentials of horror well: it's scary, the monsters are vile, and the good guys have nowhere to go; having excessive gore and violence is a plus as well. More important, it knows how to surprise a viewer w/o building it up either by cheap cuts or music.  I like a horror movie that doesn't try to be a cheap, unlike a certain horror remake that thinks a serial killer came from a broken home.This is Del Keyes, saying ""why couldn't Josh try to kill them using garlic?""NOTE:  Keep in mind, I never read theoriginal comic book.

This is the best horror movie I have seen in a long time and it is easily the best Vampire movie I have ever seen. This is a VERY rare American made gem of the horror genre of recent years. The lead ""girl of interest"" is a bit buck toothed for my taste but does a great acting job. The Sheriff, the eccentric loner, the lead Vampire......all the roles are performed by actors that really do a tremendous job (and whoever cast the actor that portrays the ""lead Vampire"" could not have found a better actor in both looks and acting ability).The lighting, the claustrophic nature of the never ending darkness of Northern Alaska and even the background sound lends itself well toward the end result, a really chilling and terrifying film!I highly recommend purchasing this movie in Blu Ray if possible. Great savings can be found from highly rated vendors selling used copies of this movies disc through Amazon and this movie is worth a purchase as you WILL want to view it more than once!My only regret is that I failed to watch this movie on the big screen when it was released. Alas I have to ""make do"" with my beloved 60"" Samsung HDTV.Whatever you do, watch this movie. If you are like me and see it by way of a borrowed copy for the first time, I bet that you will shell out the bucks for a copy for yourself!! GREAT HORROR MOVIE THAT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED!!! The only thing scarier than this movie was the result of our last Presidential Election but who can beat our Communist in Chief when it comes to horror?

I feel the movie is fairly well paced and the action doesnt really let up except for setting up the next scene or way to go for the main characters and those that choose to follow them.  They are in a town that just had its last day of sunlight as the name suggests they are in for 30 straight days of nothing but night.Making it a perfect place for the resident blood suckers to salivate and pile up a body count of crazy proportions.  They come in slowly and basically start picking off the townsfolk.  The sheriff played by Josh Hartnett, his wife played by Melissa George..i believe they are seperated.  His brother and a few other people have to band together to try and make it through this onslaught.  While being hunted by the vampires and basically trying to stay alive while scavenging for food and shelter.The movie seems have been done well as the characters make it believable and are determined to survive this despite all odds.  Also the sets and everything are pretty cool along with the snow effects and of course the main reason.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","Vampires in movies tend to be portrayed one of two ways -- as sexy pretty people, or barely-controlled beasts who only think about neck-gnaws.Well, Sam Raimi claimed that ""30 Days of Night"" was a different kind of vampire film, and would avoid falling into cliched traps. Too bad he and David Slade couldn't deliver on that -- it's a mishmash of bad cliches, illogical script, and a plot that is subzero on the ""scary"" scale.Seriously. Any movie with lines like ""That cold ain't the weather, that's death approachin'"" simply can't be taken seriously. (And yes, it IS the weather -- Alaska in winter?)Barrow, Alaska is about to have its polar night, in which the sun isn't seen for a month. Most of the people (the smart ones) leave right away, but a mysterious Stranger (Ben Foster) arrives and traps the few remaining people there. Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his ex-wife Stella (Melissa George) capture him, but the damage is done. They'll have to stay there all month.Of course, something horrible happens right away -- a pack of bloodthirsty vampires invade the place, intent on sucking the humans dry before sunrise, and they've got all month to do it. Now Eben and Stella, as well as a small band of survivors, must try to avoid becoming vampire food -- or worse, one of the vampires themselves.""30 Days of Night"" actually had some promise at the beginning -- it's based on a cult comic book, and it has an intriguing premise. The idea of being trapped in a frigid, dark, isolated town for a whole month is freaking creepy, even without supernatural threats. The pale, chilly look of the place is pretty creepy.But then the vampires appear, and the whole thing becomes a simplistic game of hide'n'seek. That's ""30 Days of Night's"" besetting sin -- it has few twists to compensate for its lack of good script, outside of the predictable UV lamp. Just lots of gore, whining, snow, and the occasional gesture to remind us that vampires are really, REALLY evil.Moreover, the anemic scripting doesn't make us care much about Barrow or its inhabitants, and is saddled with clunky dialogue (""The things you'll do to save your own."" ""We were like that once, weren't we?""). And it's riddled with plenty of plot holes, usually about the food and ammo (wouldn't Alaskans have lots of both?), characters' actions, and even the action scenes -- precisely why can a five-minute-old vampire kill a big bad old powerful one?And the vampires? Well, they're not scary, and the writers deliberately squirm out of telling us anything about them -- where they come from, what they are, what they hope to achieve, and what the heck they're doing in ALASKA rather than, say, New York or Los Angeles. Marlow is a generic bad guy, and the others are screeching deformed creatures who are pretty inept at finding our heroes.And Josh Harnett tries to act. He really does. But he's painfully wooden as the experienced small-town sheriff with a Sad Marriage behind him. Most of the other characters are ""types"" instead of people -- plucky little brother, ex-wife whom he still loves, token sacrificial people, et cetera. You're given no real reason to care about them.""30 Days of Night"" reminded me of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" but with a leaden script, boring acting, a ""night"" a month long, and annoying screeching vampires instead of freaky zombies.

Whatever the case, they were decidedly creepy (in a good way).There's something about this movie that continues to haunt me.  Maybe it's the underlining sadness of watching a few characters willingly sacrifice themselves to ensure the survival of a few remaining souls (very much like a war movie).  Or, that it's literally dark and gloomy.  Or, the complete lack of hope.  This movie is relentless.  It really only hits one long note of terror, which it sustains throughout (so I don't consider that a bad thing): like pounding on a drum, louder and louder, with the beasts still coming in droves, no matter how many are destroyed, more keep appearing.  They're ugly, they're brutal, the carnage is savage and plentiful.  I suppose this movie isn't for the faint of heart.  For those who don't like that sort of thing, beware.  Otherwise, enjoy.I also have to add that I liked the entire cast (which is rare), and I liked that they used the isolation of the place (very much like an old western - we're cut off and on our own, help won't be arriving).  The darkness, beyond obvious considerations, really worked in the movie's favor, and I really appreciated how well those 'things' were designed.

I do, however, need to be able to suspend disbelief long enough to care--even on a superficial level--about the welfare of the characters.""30 Days of Night"" starts off with stark beauty, haunting music, and an eerie setting. We're quickly introduced to the estranged couple, Stella and Eben. We also get hints of the destruction to come, at the expense of some sled dogs. I was all set to kick back, grip my armrests, and get swept into a harrowing tale. On a number of levels, the movie works. The photography is crisp, yet muted, and the acting is along the same lines. The vampires are given their own language, which adds an interesting dimension that is sadly not explored more. Soon, though, the film's implausibilities begin to add up to the point of distraction.After the initial setup of the town facing a month of darkness and vampire attacks, we find ourselves stuck in an attic with a band of survivors. Not only do they brazenly use a light, but they also clomp around in boots, and show no great plans for things as simple as going to the bathroom. They try to relocate, walking down the middle of the street. Later, with the amount of carnage they witnessed early on, they seem surprisingly unwilling to do what it takes to live another sunless day. The vampires, on the other hand, seem equally inept. Though they can smell blood, they are curiously unable to detect humans in a barren landscape unless it advances the plot.I wanted to like the film, and I found it mildly entertaining. It had the potential for more, and instead resorted to cliches of the genre instead of exploring new territory. While that may be satisfying to some horror fans, it only left me unfeeling in my response. Maybe that was the point. Maybe, in feeling nothing at the end, viewers are meant to become like the very creatures the movie so shallowly portrays. If this was a Simon Pegg film, I might see some social commentary or irony in that.

1128862,A2MWAC2SPUDECJ,B00111YM5Q,"""Franky"" ""chess nut""","[2, 2]","For better or worse human being are fascinated with these mythical creatures.  Because of that, the Vampire theme has been done over and over, so much so that it began to reach the point of diminishing returns.  ""Been there, done that"" to the extreme!  30 Days on Night is the first film about Vampires in a long time to actually try to give a fresh spin and new look to this very well mapped territory.  Here are some questions I believe the Film-makers tried to answer here: ""Are vampires simply a grossly misunderstood minority group, or are they stone evil?""  ""Are vampires wise and powerful creatures with hundreds of years of experience which they use to refine their game and who fully intend to win a fight with humans or are they just really powerful creatures with mediocre intelligence and very poor memories who are constantly surprised when humans fight back?""  If you like the Vampire sub-genre of the horror category than you know there are a few well defined ""schools of thought"" concerning the blood-suckers.  One takes the view that the concepts of right or wrong, good or evil are simply out dated notions!  That what is moral is defined by ourselves, for ourselves and the only true sin in not being true to yourself.  It further holds that no one outside your group can offer any meaningful critique of that group, i.e. only Sicilian mobsters can judge the Mafia, only people born and raised in a country can speak to that countries culture, etc.  Here the standard barer is Ann Rice and her endless fawning profiles of the poor misunderstood undead.  Here most of the Vampires are extremely good looking people with an incredible sense of style.  Females are like cast members from ""America's Next Top Model"" and males look like they just stepped off the pages of GQ.  Vampires are not the bad guys in her books as a class.  In fact, ""they're just like us"", good, bad, tragic, misunderstood, lonely, etc.  The ""bad guys"" are either over-zealous Vampire Killers or Vampires who have broken some more or less minor etiquette of the Vampire world.  Humans are just hopeless, myopic, ""humanoid-centric"" Vamp-o-phobes who react with extreme fear and violence to Vampires solely out of ignorance and raw, unbridled prejudice.  The prototypical example of this type of Vampire story would be ""An Interview with a Vampire"".  It was adapted to a movie with pretty boy Tom Cruise and Brad Prit preening around the screen trying to find Vampire happiness.  Another basis for the myth is very religion based.  The Vampires are agents of the Devil and do his work.  Humans are helpless against them save that we invoke God's power (I.E holy water, the Cross, etc) in humbleness and faith.  In this day and age that is pretty rare.  For an example you'd have to check out the old ""Hammer"" series.  Note: They are very old-school, but very effective scary movies!  30 Days... takes a very practical view: Vampires are a clan of Humanoid Creatures that regard Non-Vampiric humans like we would look at a slaughter house cow.  They jealously guard their realm and very strongly restrict the creation of new Vampires.  They also go into an encounter with humans with a stone cold mandate: We win, you lose!  They do not intend to allow any meaningful resistance from their prey and are clearly not interested in a ""fair fight"".  Wow!  This realistic approach is shockingly different from many films where the ferocious but stupid vampire(s) simply move into town, sets up shop, and then is shocked to discover that human beings get nosy and agitated when a string of unexplained disappearances and/or murders begin!  Here the Vampires pick a town that is so close to the Artic circle that they can frolic in a month long play land of No Sun and dozens of juicy humans to pick off at their leisure.

It works surprisingly well, with pretty good performances all-round, especially the supporting cast (e.g., watch for Ben Foster -- he of '3:10 to Yuma' fame -- as a creepy vampire wanna-be at the film's start; also: Danny Huston is very good as the apparent ""pack leader"").  One flaw is the lack of in-depth characterizations (or sufficient ""back-story"") for the major players, but hey it is a horror film after all... so it gets right to the scares pretty quickly.  I found it particularly suspenseful in the first 20 minutes or so, as the townfolk gradually discover that they are, in essence, being stalked by a pack of ravenous undead.  The film actually reminded me a bit of 'Pitch Black', a pretty good Vin Diesel flick from a few years back... but with different ""monsters"" of course.  The plot device of having the protagonists plunged into darkness works very well for both films.The film's cinematography and lighting (or lack thereof) create a truly creepy atmosphere.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[10, 11]","Remember those scary vampire flicks where the characters frantically try to wait out the night and avoid becoming fodder to the undead? Knowing that if they could just hold on, the sun, like clockwork, will rise and force the nasties to skulk away to their crypts. But what if the sun doesn't come up the next day? What if it doesn't come up for thirty days?The tiny, remote town of Barrow can be found somewhere in the boonies of Alaska. It is the northernmost town in the U.S., and each winter, thanks to its proximity to the North Pole, it suffers a month of rigorous, sunless days. Around this time most of Barrow's residents usually migrate to better climates. This winter, the population count dwindles from 563 to 152. It's about to be drastically reduced even more.It's the last day of the sun now, and town sheriff Eben Oleson (a very good, steady Josh Hartnett ) is investigating a slew of peculiar events in Barrow. First, he finds the charred remnants of cellular phones. Then there's news of a pack of dogs which had been massacred, followed by the sabotaging of the town's sole helicopter. A mangy, loony stranger (Ben Foster, again sinking his teeth into his role) raises a ruckus in the local diner and soon starts spouting enigmatic and disturbing comments (such as ""The cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.""). Disquietingly, the Internet and phone services fail, and the power goes out. Then the vampires come.30 DAYS OF NIGHT, based on the taut graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, takes its time to deliver the goods, but when it does, bloody hell! For the first 20 minutes or so, the players (re: victims) are introduced and their interrelationships delved into. We meet the angry couple whose dogs were just slaughtered, the hermit living on the town's outskirts, the sheriff's younger brother and grandmother, the girl left alone for the month...However, it's quickly established that the two main protagonists are Sheriff Oleson and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George), who's a fire marshall. Romantically, things haven't been good for these two for a while, and in fact Stella was on her way to the airport to get the hell out of town. But events conspire to trap her in Barrow and force her to work with Oleson to desperately save what's left of the populace.From the very start, the film makes you aware that these folks don't stand a chance against their vicious, supernatural stalkers. For the characters in the film, it takes a bit longer for this realization to dawn. But when it does, it's a despairing, crippling thing. Helpless and isolated, the terrified survivors must determine whether to hole up or flee. But it doesn't matter, really. The odds for them are very bleak. The vampires are cunning and remorseless, and they keep coming. No romanticizing here of the undead, no pretenses to velvet cloaks and cultured elegance and tortured angst. The film deconstructs these monsters into rough, feral, ghoulish things, with fearsome teeth that would baffle a Beverly Hills orthodentist and make a Mako shark go all covetous. Instead of genteel, lordly speech, some ancient, guttural language is used. And most of the usual stuff don't work on them: not garlic, not holy water, not the cross. Direct sunlight would kill them, but...30 DAYS OF NIGHT is a nasty, white-knuckle fright ride, and so what if there isn't much character development? The movie has an awesome gimmick and it runs with it full tilt. THIS is a rated-R picture and it takes advantage of that. Shudders - and the anticipation of them - come aplenty as the hapless survivors attempt to survive by engaging in a tension-wracked game of hide and seek from the vampires. And when the Barrow-ites are caught, the film wallows in scenes of devastating carnage and gore. I thought I was desensitized to horror cinema by now, but this one had several truly brutal, graphic vampire attacks which startled me to bits. The bleakness and fright and dwindling hope felt by the film characters are palpable. The two leads are appealingly brave and selfless, and one wishes good things for them, even as that sinking feeling washes over one - that there probably isn't a happy ending in sight.",4,"""Bar the windows, try to hide - they're comin'.""",1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,4216,"['Remember', 'scary', 'vampire', 'flicks', 'where', 'characters', 'frantically', 'try', 'wait', 'out', 'night', 'avoid', 'becoming', 'fodder', 'undead', 'Knowing', 'could', 'just', 'hold', 'sun', 'clockwork', 'will', 'rise', 'force', 'nasties', 'skulk', 'away', 'crypts', 'what', 'sun', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'What', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'thirty', 'days', 'tiny', 'remote', 'town', 'Barrow', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'somewhere', 'boonies', 'Alaska', 'northernmost', 'town', 'U.S.', 'winter', 'thanks', 'proximity', 'North', 'Pole', 'month', 'rigorous', 'sunless', 'days', 'time', 'most', 'Barrow', 'residents', 'usually', 'migrate', 'better', 'climates', 'winter', 'population', 'count', 'dwindles', '563', '152', 'be', 'drastically', 'reduced', 'even', 'more.It', 'last', 'day', 'sun', 'now', 'town', 'sheriff', 'Eben', 'Oleson', 'very', 'good', 'steady', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'investigating', 'slew', 'peculiar', 'events', 'Barrow', 'First', 'charred', 'remnants', 'cellular', 'phones', 'Then', 'news', 'pack', 'dogs', 'had', 'been', 'massacred', 'followed', 'sabotaging', 'town', 'sole', 'helicopter', 'mangy', 'loony', 'stranger', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'again', 'sinking', 'teeth', 'role', 'ruckus', 'local', 'diner', 'soon', 'starts', 'spouting', 'enigmatic', 'disturbing', 'comments', 'such', 'cold', 'ai', ""n't"", 'weather', 'death', 'approaching.', 'Disquietingly', 'Internet', 'phone', 'services', 'fail', 'power', 'out', 'Then', 'vampires', 'come.30', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'NIGHT', 'based', 'taut', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Steve', 'Niles', 'Ben', 'Templesmith', 'time', 'deliver', 'goods', 'when', 'bloody', 'hell', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'players', 're', 'victims', 'are', 'introduced', 'interrelationships', 'delved', 'meet', 'angry', 'couple', 'dogs', 'were', 'just', 'slaughtered', 'hermit', 'living', 'town', 'outskirts', 'sheriff', 'younger', 'brother', 'grandmother', 'girl', 'left', 'alone', 'month', 'However', 'quickly', 'established', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'are', 'Sheriff', 'Oleson', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Melissa', 'George', 'who', 'fire', 'marshall', 'Romantically', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'good', 'two', 'while', 'fact', 'Stella', 'was', 'way', 'airport', 'get', 'hell', 'town', 'events', 'conspire', 'trap', 'Barrow', 'force', 'work', 'Oleson', 'desperately', 'save', 'what', 'left', 'populace.From', 'very', 'start', 'film', 'aware', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'vicious', 'supernatural', 'stalkers', 'characters', 'film', 'bit', 'longer', 'realization', 'dawn', 'when', 'despairing', 'crippling', 'thing', 'Helpless', 'isolated', 'terrified', 'survivors', 'must', 'determine', 'hole', 'up', 'flee', ""n't"", 'matter', 'really', 'odds', 'are', 'very', 'bleak', 'vampires', 'are', 'cunning', 'remorseless', 'keep', 'coming', 'romanticizing', 'here', 'undead', 'pretenses', 'velvet', 'cloaks', 'cultured', 'elegance', 'tortured', 'angst', 'film', 'monsters', 'rough', 'feral', 'ghoulish', 'things', 'fearsome', 'teeth', 'would', 'baffle', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'orthodentist', 'make', 'Mako', 'shark', 'go', 'covetous', 'Instead', 'genteel', 'lordly', 'speech', 'ancient', 'guttural', 'language', 'used', 'most', 'usual', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'not', 'garlic', 'not', 'holy', 'water', 'not', 'cross', 'Direct', 'sunlight', 'would', 'kill', '30', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'NIGHT', 'nasty', 'white-knuckle', 'fright', 'ride', 'so', 'what', ""n't"", 'much', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'awesome', 'gimmick', 'full', 'tilt', 'THIS', 'rated-R', 'picture', 'advantage', 'Shudders', 'anticipation', 'come', 'aplenty', 'hapless', 'survivors', 'attempt', 'survive', 'engaging', 'tension-wracked', 'game', 'hide', 'seek', 'vampires', 'when', 'Barrow-ites', 'are', 'caught', 'film', 'scenes', 'devastating', 'carnage', 'gore', 'thought', 'was', 'desensitized', 'horror', 'cinema', 'now', 'one', 'had', 'several', 'truly', 'brutal', 'graphic', 'vampire', 'attacks', 'startled', 'bits', 'bleakness', 'fright', 'dwindling', 'hope', 'felt', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'palpable', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'appealingly', 'brave', 'selfless', 'one', 'wishes', 'good', 'things', 'even', 'sinking', 'feeling', 'washes', 'one', 'probably', ""n't"", 'happy', 'ending', 'sight']",N/A

I should've stopped taking his advice for vampire movies after he suggested I watch the cinematic bowel movement that was Let the Right One In.So the movie takes place in some lame ass isolated snow village, what the hell? Where's the local highschool? Where's the local mall? Where's the beauty salon? They obviously made this stupid village up because there's no way I can relate to it. So we get a bunch of ugly dudes with full on beards, I mean helloooo? It's called a razor, if Jacob Black can use it these neanderthals can as well, I don't see them howling at the moon, just like I wish Jacob would howl at my moon... *Sigh* Anyways once you see the vampires they look like a bunch of Russian ravers or something, WHAT THE HELL?? Why aren't they shirtless and sparkling? Stephenie Meyer as we all know started the vampire craze with Dracula would be shaking her head in shame if she saw these lame zombie-raver abominations they call 'vampires'. More like Vagpires LOL!, cuz Edward could totally beat them up LOL!The movie seemed like it could redeem itself when the first vampire attack happens, two guys arguing over a girl (Twilight did it first) get interuppted by a vampire who jumps on one of the dudes, and it looks like maybe they're making out for a quick second, which would make this movie rating rise substantially (as well as making my Dark Knight Rise) but unfortunately it was just eating him. STUPID!!! If this is a zombie movie, it's a zombie movie, but don't call them vampires, Count Edward would be ashamed. After I realized there'd be no steamy sex scenes featuring shirtless men to the latest Usher song I turned this tripe off and watched a REAL vampire film instead, like Queen of the Damned!",1,MORE LIKE 30 MINUTES OF BAD!

1128879,A1OSURJOA9MHM2,B00111YM5Q,Jason from Georgia,"[0, 3]","I've said it before and I'll say it again. I don't consider any of the Twilight films to be vampire movies. The ""vampires"" in these films are more like glittery, gay super humans who do nothing but whine despite having no real tragic issues to deal with. Indeed, they are a far cry from the creatures of the night we've come to know and love. But thankfully we don't have to go back too far to a time when decent vampire films were still being made that had nothing to do with high school students, teen drama, team Edwards or team Jacobs.2007's 30 Days of Night is based on a comic book mini-series (graphic novel) written by Steve Niles and illustrated by Ben Templesmith. It takes place in a small, isolated Alaskan town called Barrow. Winters are always cold and harsh for the residents but living becomes even more difficult during the Polar Night, a yearly occurrence where the sun seemingly disappears and night lasts 30 days. This harsh environment is too much for many of the people who choose to leave the town behind during this time of year. Once the sun sets and the Barrow is covered in pitch black darkness, strange things begin to happen. All the sledding dogs in the town are viciously murdered and power to certain buildings are cut. The town sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) investigates and comes upon a stranger at the local diner who is acting very odd (trying to order raw meat). Oleson's estranged wife Stella Oleson (Melissa George) helps to arrest the stranger. Stella has missed her flight out of Barrow and is stuck there for a month. Things soon get much worse when a group of vampires attacks the town, cutting power completely and ravaging a majority of the residents. Will anyone be able to survive with all modern communication cut from the outside world for 30 sunless days and nights?30 Days of Night sets things up quickly before getting to the good stuff. Many have complained that there isn't enough character development and there were indeed instances where I would like to have known a bit more about some of the minor characters. Had some of the other characters been developed a bit more we as an audience would have certainly cared more about what happened to them. But we quickly get all the basics such as how the town is small enough to where everyone pretty much knows one another and how Eben and Stella have had marital issues.Many of the usual rules of vampire lore are thankfully applied such as vulnerability to sunlight (though that one is debatable given that the original Dracula could walk about in daylight), powerful strength and of course the ability to turn humans into vampires. Do crosses and garlic work? We never get the chance to find out. However, despite following many of the classic rules these are not your Bela Lugosi-like vampires with proper manners. On the contrary, they are presented as ancient, feral, savage creatures whose only desire is to feed on human blood. One could compare them to zombies with more abilities and intelligence. The vampires also have their own language that sounds tribal-like. It's a nice touch that lets us know that these guys are not from the same world as humans nor do they have a desire to be.There's no seduction going on here, these vampires are brutal killers who pounce their victims and violently suck them try, convulsing wildly as they rip their victims flesh further. Some of them don't even bother to wipe dried blood from their mouth. The groups leader seems to have a bit more ""class"" but make no mistake, they all look incredibly scary. The make-up, costume design and gore is done very well and when you think back to Barrow late at night while you're tucked in bed, you may just hug your pillows a little bit closer.Sadly, as good as 30 Days of Night starts it falters towards the end. Without giving anything away I will only say that something rather ridiculous happens and that the ending is anti-climatic as well as unsatisfying. Also, as mentioned before, 30 Days of Night would have been much more impactful if its characters had been better established. The only characters we care about are sheriff Eben and Stella (...and she's really debatable). However, for fans of vampire and horror films, 30 Days of Night does a lot of things right. The gore is savage and satisfying, the vampires look incredibly creepy and prospect of being in the pitch dark night for 30 days is the perfect setting that will make most who watch feel at least some fear.

1128880,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00111YM5Q,Jason,"[2, 2]","When the isolated town of Barrow, Alaska has its yearly occurrence of 30 days without sunlight, the majority of townsfolk begin their migration towards civilization.  Those that remain expect a quiet, albeit dark, escape from routine.  When their connection to the outside world gets cut off - electricity, internet, the emergency helicopter, even the sled dogs - the darkness becomes the least of their worries.The explosion of violence that follows is jaw dropping, as a collection of vampires wreaks bloody havoc throughout, with the lead vampire giving instruction to essentially kill everyone.  And the best part is, they get the vampires exactly as I like them.  They are bloodthirsty killers with superhuman strength, seeking to feast on the blood of every town inhabitant.  Absolutely mesmerizing in every way, the vampires scream through blood-soaked fangs, and leap on their prey like animals.  The vampires' screeching howls, like owls being butchered, are bloodcurdling.  Among the more memorable vampires is what I like to call ""Goldberg vampire,"" a brutal killer with a slight resemblance to the wrestler.  Other significant vampires look like Marilyn Manson and Suzanne Summers, which make the murders somewhat enjoyable at times.As the living humans scatter in fear, director David Slade absolutely cranks it up a notch by making nearly every aspect of the movie an extension of fear.  The atmosphere is lethal; the music is creepy, and the isolation of the town itself provides for drastic color changes, drastic blood red on blinding snow white, is terrifying perfection.  The absolute best scene, cinematographically speaking, is top-down scrolling look as chaos reigns supreme, with everyone and everything running haphazardly, as carnage overtakes reason.Battling the bloodthirsty predators is Josh Hartnett, the town sheriff, and his wife Stella (Melissa George).  Dropping off one by one, it's Hartnett and a few others relying on their wits and their knowledge of the town to stay alive.  Vicious and intense, the only flaw in this gore-fest is the final battle - not the outcome - as the desire to produce a predictable ending forced the filmmakers to include an absurd action from a previously level-headed character.  Overall, however, this is an excellent, modern addition to the vampire genre which currently needs less sparkling and more killing.Jason Elin",4,A vampire movie for adults,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,2386,"['When', 'isolated', 'town', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'yearly', 'occurrence', '30', 'days', 'sunlight', 'majority', 'townsfolk', 'begin', 'migration', 'civilization', 'remain', 'expect', 'quiet', 'albeit', 'dark', 'escape', 'routine', 'When', 'connection', 'outside', 'world', 'cut', 'off', 'electricity', 'internet', 'emergency', 'helicopter', 'even', 'sled', 'dogs', 'darkness', 'least', 'worries.The', 'explosion', 'violence', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'collection', 'vampires', 'wreaks', 'bloody', 'havoc', 'lead', 'vampire', 'giving', 'instruction', 'essentially', 'kill', 'everyone', 'best', 'part', 'get', 'vampires', 'exactly', 'like', 'are', 'bloodthirsty', 'killers', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'seeking', 'feast', 'blood', 'town', 'inhabitant', 'Absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'way', 'vampires', 'scream', 'blood-soaked', 'fangs', 'leap', 'prey', 'animals', 'vampires', 'screeching', 'howls', 'owls', 'being', 'butchered', 'are', 'bloodcurdling', 'more', 'memorable', 'vampires', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'Goldberg', 'vampire', 'brutal', 'killer', 'slight', 'resemblance', 'wrestler', 'Other', 'significant', 'vampires', 'look', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'Suzanne', 'Summers', 'make', 'murders', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'living', 'humans', 'scatter', 'fear', 'director', 'David', 'Slade', 'absolutely', 'up', 'notch', 'making', 'nearly', 'aspect', 'movie', 'extension', 'fear', 'atmosphere', 'lethal', 'music', 'creepy', 'isolation', 'town', 'drastic', 'color', 'changes', 'drastic', 'blood', 'red', 'blinding', 'snow', 'white', 'terrifying', 'perfection', 'absolute', 'best', 'scene', 'cinematographically', 'speaking', 'top-down', 'scrolling', 'look', 'chaos', 'reigns', 'supreme', 'everyone', 'everything', 'running', 'haphazardly', 'carnage', 'overtakes', 'reason.Battling', 'bloodthirsty', 'predators', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'town', 'sheriff', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Melissa', 'George', 'Dropping', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'Hartnett', 'few', 'others', 'relying', 'wits', 'knowledge', 'town', 'stay', 'alive', 'Vicious', 'intense', 'only', 'flaw', 'gore-fest', 'final', 'battle', 'not', 'outcome', 'desire', 'produce', 'predictable', 'ending', 'forced', 'filmmakers', 'include', 'absurd', 'action', 'previously', 'level-headed', 'character', 'Overall', 'however', 'excellent', 'modern', 'addition', 'vampire', 'genre', 'currently', 'less', 'sparkling', 'more', 'killing.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

The movie is set in Barrow Alaska. A small town in a very remote place. Josh Harttnet plays the sherriff who encounters strange happenings after the sun goes down for the next thirty days, only to find out that evil vampires are about to kill everyone in their path and take over the town. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat about ten minutes in, and does not let go to the end. You can really feel what some of the victims went through as they are slaughtered at every turn. Because ,they mostly kept the camera on the victims during most of the attacks, instead of seeing a victim get attacked then the camera turned away. It has been awhile since I have squirmed in my seat, seeing so much carnage in a horror film. Okay, the only draw back is the sub par acting and plot holes, like, where did the Vampires come from and other minor things.The over all story and pace of the movie is done very well. I could not leave my seatto get any popcorn or go to the bathroom, because there was something going on.The vampires are very convincing looking. They definitly are better than most of the vampire movies I have seen in recent years. The gore factor is 10, the suspence another 10, the acting who gives a damn, this is a horror movie. Not a drama, chick flick or kiddie flick. To some of the people Iwill say this, like the movie for what it is. It is an uncomplicated movie and stylishly done.

1128885,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00111YM5Q,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[6, 7]","Gone are the vampires who are so completely wimpy that Blade can kill with a single swing of his manly sword. The lead vampire in particular Danny Huston who is an identifiable character saturated in menace at the same time peering at his victims with soulless black eyes. These vamps are, in every sense, nasty unlikable, disgusting, weird and utterly scary, just like a vampire should be.So they come by boat to feed of the population of Barrow, an Alaskan small town, a place where no person ever seems to joke or smile. They're forced to live, once a year, in perpetual darkness during the winter. Director David Slade knows how to create tension and horror without showing you much, and that happens to be a plus point with its extremely patient build up, and the heightening of suspense. You have to tip your hat at him for crafting a very quiet movie at crucial scenes, so much so that the audience lend their ""Ssshhhhs"" not to tell fellow audience to keep quiet, but aimed at the characters themselves to remain like little mice lest they get detected. '30 Days of Night' is a very grey movie in mood, tone and the weather.The humans here though behave like typical vampire movie fodder. The bigger the ensemble, the more victims it can provide, not counting anonymous folks seen being victims from afar. Josh Hartnett's Sheriff Eben plays hero as he leads his bewildered town kinsman to survive through this 30 days of mayhem before the sun shines again, while trying to work out his estranged relationship with wife Stella (a very pouty Melissa George fromTuristas (Unrated Edition), and I still say she's a dead ringer for Estella Warren!). As usual, you have a team of misfits feeding off each other's strength in a quest for survival, and a theme such as Sacrifice is never too far away from movies like these.The real interesting take on the vampires is that they have their own language and move like starved, rabid animals. They don't seem to have a master plan for world domination or being part of a conspiracy, they're just there and the way they look will scare most people. Their facial feature is like something out of a David Lynch nightmare.I like that this is a mystery, not an action movie and the only other scary vampire movie in modern times isShadow of the Vampire, a movie almost as scary. But I can hear my vampire-loving friends bring this down, since the vamps didn't play spinette, spoke with eastern European accents and moaned like the best sex they've ever had every time they sink their teeth into flesh. They don't even seem to be enjoying themselves. There is one more movie that comes to mind and that The Addiction, where vampirism also seem to be more of a decease like alcoholism or bulimia. It does contain some pretty violent scenes like the massacre on the dogs, the gunplay and decapitations that look almost too realistic.But what I felt was a let down to its build up, was the unsatisfying ending, which left a bitter aftertaste with its abruptness and inability to resolve anything substantial. It also didn't allow for any sympathy for the victims as you would sometimes find yourself rooting for another kill just to satisfy your blood lust, also because little time is given for you to get to know those characters. As the humans learn that guns do zilch to their targets, there goes all hope, and try as they could to get creative in turning the tables, it boiled down to keeping it simple. Thumbs up for the vampires but as for the whole film in general it could have been a lot more, but unfortunately left some bits to be desired.",3,"3.5--This takes the tired, done to death vampire story and puts an unmarked spin to it.",1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,3589,"['Gone', 'are', 'vampires', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'completely', 'wimpy', 'Blade', 'can', 'kill', 'single', 'swing', 'manly', 'sword', 'lead', 'vampire', 'particular', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'who', 'identifiable', 'character', 'saturated', 'menace', 'same', 'time', 'peering', 'victims', 'soulless', 'black', 'eyes', 'vamps', 'are', 'sense', 'nasty', 'unlikable', 'disgusting', 'weird', 'utterly', 'scary', 'just', 'vampire', 'should', 'be.So', 'come', 'boat', 'feed', 'population', 'Barrow', 'Alaskan', 'small', 'town', 'place', 'where', 'person', 'ever', 'joke', 'smile', ""'re"", 'forced', 'live', 'once', 'year', 'perpetual', 'darkness', 'winter', 'Director', 'David', 'Slade', 'how', 'create', 'tension', 'horror', 'showing', 'much', 'be', 'plus', 'point', 'extremely', 'patient', 'build', 'up', 'heightening', 'suspense', 'have', 'tip', 'hat', 'crafting', 'very', 'quiet', 'movie', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'so', 'much', 'audience', 'lend', 'Ssshhhhs', 'not', 'tell', 'fellow', 'audience', 'keep', 'quiet', 'aimed', 'characters', 'remain', 'like', 'little', 'mice', 'lest', 'get', 'detected', ""'30"", 'Days', 'Night', 'very', 'grey', 'movie', 'mood', 'tone', 'weather.The', 'humans', 'here', 'behave', 'typical', 'vampire', 'movie', 'fodder', 'bigger', 'ensemble', 'more', 'victims', 'can', 'provide', 'not', 'counting', 'anonymous', 'folks', 'seen', 'being', 'victims', 'afar', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Sheriff', 'Eben', 'hero', 'bewildered', 'town', 'kinsman', 'survive', '30', 'days', 'mayhem', 'sun', 'shines', 'again', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'estranged', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Stella', 'very', 'pouty', 'Melissa', 'George', 'fromTuristas', 'Unrated', 'Edition', 'still', 'say', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'usual', 'have', 'team', 'misfits', 'feeding', 'off', 'other', 'strength', 'quest', 'survival', 'theme', 'such', 'Sacrifice', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'movies', 'these.The', 'real', 'interesting', 'take', 'vampires', 'have', 'own', 'language', 'move', 'starved', 'rabid', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'master', 'plan', 'world', 'domination', 'being', 'part', 'conspiracy', ""'re"", 'just', 'there', 'way', 'look', 'will', 'scare', 'most', 'people', 'facial', 'feature', 'something', 'David', 'Lynch', 'nightmare.I', 'like', 'mystery', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'only', 'other', 'scary', 'vampire', 'movie', 'modern', 'times', 'isShadow', 'Vampire', 'movie', 'almost', 'scary', 'can', 'hear', 'vampire-loving', 'friends', 'bring', 'down', 'vamps', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'spinette', 'spoke', 'eastern', 'European', 'accents', 'moaned', 'best', 'sex', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'time', 'sink', 'teeth', 'flesh', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoying', 'one', 'more', 'movie', 'mind', 'Addiction', 'where', 'vampirism', 'also', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'decease', 'alcoholism', 'bulimia', 'contain', 'pretty', 'violent', 'scenes', 'massacre', 'dogs', 'gunplay', 'decapitations', 'look', 'almost', 'too', 'realistic.But', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'build', 'up', 'was', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'left', 'bitter', 'aftertaste', 'abruptness', 'inability', 'resolve', 'anything', 'substantial', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'sympathy', 'victims', 'would', 'sometimes', 'find', 'rooting', 'kill', 'just', 'satisfy', 'blood', 'lust', 'also', 'little', 'time', 'given', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'humans', 'learn', 'guns', 'do', 'zilch', 'targets', 'hope', 'try', 'could', 'get', 'creative', 'turning', 'tables', 'boiled', 'down', 'keeping', 'simple', 'Thumbs', 'up', 'vampires', 'whole', 'film', 'general', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'unfortunately', 'left', 'bits', 'be', 'desired']",N/A

1128889,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B00111YM5Q,Joe Carugati,"[2, 3]","Based on Steve Niles' graphic novel, ""30 Days of Night"" seemed like it would be right up my alley.  Besides being a fan of the horror genre, it looked to sport a great look and style, a slick premise, and new take on the vampire story.  Unfortunately, my expectations were not met and the film wasn't nowhere as good as it could have been.In Barrow, Alaska, the sun sets and doesn't rise for 30 days.  As the townspeople begin to get ready for the oncoming darkness, Sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett) is making final preparations when strange things begin to occur around town.  Cell phones are found burning and sled dogs turn up dead.  The culprit (Ben Foster) is brought to the jail, where he tells Eben and his Deputy wife, Stella (Melissa George), that ""death's approaching"".  He couldn't be more right.  As the sun goes down, a pack of vampires led by Marlow (Danny Huston) come into town and don't have any plans on leaving soon.  Thus, a group of survivors need to band together to stay alive for the 30 days of night.As I stated earlier, the plot for the film is quite unique.  Instead of the usual vampire film where the sun comes up at the end and the creature of the night burst into flames, ""30 Days of Night"" prolongs the darkness so that there really is no safety or hope for the townspeople in the near future.  The problem is that this feeling of desperation never truly gets across and hinders the film from becoming great.  Luckily, good acting and fairly solid ending keep it from being unwatchable.I only recently realized that Josh Hartnett gets hated on a lot for his acting and I don't get it.  I've always liked the guy.  From ""The Faculty"" to ""Black Hawk Down,"" he's always been a solid actor and it's no different here.  He holds the film together and does a great job.  As his wife, Melissa George is also quite good.  The chemistry the two share is believable and engaging enough to keep the story moving along.  Danny Huston (see ""The Proposition"" immediately if you haven't) is menacing as the lead vampire and his expressions are creepy, but the writers could have done away with his unnecessary subtitled language.  Although the character development for most of the side characters was fairly poor, the actors made the most they could with the roles.For some reason, the ending of the film worked for me as well.  I'm not going to give anything crucial away, but a character makes a decision that the audience will question.  I found it fresh and different than other Hollywood endings.  It doesn't take the safe route out and for me it was refreshing and risky, something more films need to aim for these days.I hate to put the blame on one's shoulders for the film's shortcomings, but director David Slade really does deserve that honor.  With such a great idea, it seemed like there was no way it could be executed poorly, but sadly, it is.  First, the entire film lacks the most important aspect of a horror film: tension and scares.  Throughout the entire film, there wasn't one scene that creeped me out or gave me the chills.  The vampire attacks just begin to happen and there is no real build-up to them.  They just occur and aren't that interesting.  Second, speaking of the vampires, their attacks are shot in the ""shaky-cam"" style, which is really starting to wear thin.  Besides getting a headache trying to see what's happening, it just comes across as lazy and uninspired.  I could watch ""28 Days Later"" and get the same effect (at least that film was better).  The vampire attacks aren't terrifying, but a jumbled mess instead.  Third, Slade doesn't know if he wants the film to play more with the viewer's imagination or to revel in the bloodshed.  For instance, a character is killed offscreen and the sounds from his death make the scene tense.  Yet, in another scene, the director decides to show a victim get decapitated chop by chop with an axe and it's not truly scary, but just an effect.  Slade tries to make a balance between not showing violence and really showing violence and it comes off a tad disjointed.  Finally, the film takes place over 30 days, but it never feels like it at all.  Title cards that state, ""Day 18,"" don't really make it feel like time has past.  If some transitions had been thrown in between scenes, then maybe it would have been more believable, but as it is, it feels like the entire 30 days takes place over one night.  This is the worst part of the film, because the premise is such a great idea and it's not handled well.Overall, ""30 Days of Night"" was a disappointment.  Director David Slade needs to know how to create tension, atmosphere, and suspense if he wants to keep the audience engaged the entire time.  At least, the performances were good and the ending was different and unique.  Still, it didn't elevate the film from being mediocre.",2,30 Days of Night,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,4834,"['Based', 'Steve', 'Niles', 'graphic', 'novel', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'being', 'fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'looked', 'sport', 'great', 'look', 'style', 'slick', 'premise', 'new', 'take', 'vampire', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'met', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been.In', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'sun', 'sets', ""n't"", 'rise', '30', 'days', 'townspeople', 'begin', 'get', 'ready', 'oncoming', 'darkness', 'Sheriff', 'Eben', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'making', 'final', 'preparations', 'when', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'occur', 'around', 'town', 'Cell', 'phones', 'are', 'found', 'burning', 'sled', 'dogs', 'turn', 'up', 'dead', 'culprit', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'brought', 'jail', 'where', 'Eben', 'Deputy', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Melissa', 'George', 'death', 'approaching', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'right', 'sun', 'down', 'pack', 'vampires', 'led', 'Marlow', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'come', 'town', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'plans', 'leaving', 'soon', 'Thus', 'group', 'survivors', 'need', 'band', 'together', 'stay', 'alive', '30', 'days', 'night.As', 'stated', 'earlier', 'plot', 'film', 'quite', 'unique', 'Instead', 'usual', 'vampire', 'film', 'where', 'sun', 'up', 'end', 'creature', 'night', 'burst', 'flames', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'darkness', 'so', 'really', 'safety', 'hope', 'townspeople', 'near', 'future', 'problem', 'feeling', 'desperation', 'never', 'truly', 'film', 'becoming', 'great', 'Luckily', 'good', 'acting', 'fairly', 'solid', 'ending', 'keep', 'being', 'unwatchable.I', 'only', 'recently', 'realized', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'hated', 'lot', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'guy', 'Faculty', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'always', 'been', 'solid', 'actor', 'different', 'here', 'film', 'together', 'great', 'job', 'wife', 'Melissa', 'George', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'chemistry', 'two', 'share', 'believable', 'engaging', 'enough', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'along', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'see', 'Proposition', 'immediately', 'have', ""n't"", 'menacing', 'lead', 'vampire', 'expressions', 'are', 'creepy', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'away', 'unnecessary', 'subtitled', 'language', 'character', 'development', 'most', 'side', 'characters', 'was', 'fairly', 'poor', 'actors', 'made', 'most', 'could', 'roles.For', 'reason', 'ending', 'film', 'worked', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'anything', 'crucial', 'away', 'character', 'decision', 'audience', 'will', 'question', 'found', 'fresh', 'different', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'endings', ""n't"", 'take', 'safe', 'route', 'was', 'refreshing', 'risky', 'something', 'more', 'films', 'need', 'aim', 'days.I', 'hate', 'put', 'blame', 'one', 'shoulders', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'director', 'David', 'Slade', 'really', 'deserve', 'honor', 'such', 'great', 'idea', 'seemed', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'executed', 'poorly', 'sadly', 'First', 'entire', 'film', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'horror', 'film', 'tension', 'scares', 'entire', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'scene', 'creeped', 'out', 'gave', 'chills', 'vampire', 'attacks', 'just', 'begin', 'happen', 'real', 'build-up', 'just', 'occur', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'Second', 'speaking', 'vampires', 'attacks', 'are', 'shot', 'shaky-cam', 'style', 'really', 'starting', 'wear', 'thin', 'getting', 'headache', 'trying', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'just', 'across', 'lazy', 'uninspired', 'could', 'watch', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'get', 'same', 'effect', 'least', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'vampire', 'attacks', 'are', ""n't"", 'terrifying', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'instead', 'Third', 'Slade', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'play', 'more', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'revel', 'bloodshed', 'instance', 'character', 'killed', 'offscreen', 'sounds', 'death', 'make', 'scene', 'tense', 'scene', 'director', 'show', 'victim', 'get', 'decapitated', 'chop', 'chop', 'axe', 'not', 'truly', 'scary', 'just', 'effect', 'Slade', 'tries', 'make', 'balance', 'not', 'showing', 'violence', 'really', 'showing', 'violence', 'off', 'tad', 'disjointed', 'Finally', 'film', 'place', '30', 'days', 'never', 'Title', 'cards', 'state', 'Day', '18', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'feel', 'time', 'past', 'transitions', 'had', 'been', 'thrown', 'scenes', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'entire', '30', 'days', 'place', 'one', 'night', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'premise', 'such', 'great', 'idea', 'not', 'handled', 'well.Overall', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Director', 'David', 'Slade', 'know', 'how', 'create', 'tension', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'keep', 'audience', 'engaged', 'entire', 'time', 'least', 'performances', 'were', 'good', 'ending', 'was', 'different', 'unique', 'Still', 'did', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'film', 'being', 'mediocre']",N/A

Socha,"[0, 0]","I've never seen the graphic novel, so I cannot speak to how well it was adapted.Basically, the plot is a bunch of Alaskans play a deadly game of hide and seek with single-minded vampires who are very strong, during the annual 30 day solar blackout.There was absolutely NO HUMOR in this movie, hence my attempt at it in the title.  There was also no church of any kind it town, so no crosses, holy water or any tradtional stuff.  But there was lots of wood for stakes, but nobody thought of that. They did try bear traps.My first thought upon seeing the head vampire in a black business suit with open necked white dress shirt and short cropped hair was that he looked a LOT like a Madison Avenue advertising executive after a four-martini lunch.Even though the vamps probably have been around for 500+ years, they never learned a word of English. I imagined Sarah Palin jumping in a scene, shouting, &#34;If you'e gonna come here and SUCK OUR BLOOD, the least you can do is LEARN OUR LANGUAGE!&#34;And there were way too may high decible screams, which I guess was supposed to be scary.Filmed in New Zealand, BTW.

1128893,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B00111YM5Q,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[2, 3]","(Possible Spoilers)""30 Days of Night"" is a fun, albeit long vampire movie, based on the graphic novel of the same name.The ""basic"" story takes place in Barrow, Alaska, the northern most town in the U.S. where every year the city plunges into darkness for 30 days in the movie, but actually I've been told it can be for as long as 4-5 months.But regardless the town plunges into darkness and a band of vampires, judging from their accents are from some Russian country, come to Barrow and after disabling the towns satellite phones and electricity, begin to chow down on the town's citizens. A group of survivors must try to survive until the sun rises again 30 days later.There's a few key characters here, including Eben Olson a sheriff (Josh Hartnett, ""40 Days & 40 Nights"" & ""Pearl Harbor""), his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George, ""The Amityville Horror"" & ""Turistas"") and Ben Foster as The Stranger (""The Punisher"" & ""3:10 to Yuma"") among others.Most of the rest of the cast are various throwaway people that either end up as vamp. food or die in some spectacular way. Though  Mark Boone Junior (""Batman Begins"") is good as a grizzled drunk guy of sorts, who does save the main characters on more than one occasion and has a pretty decent death scene.The movie itself consists of the ever dwindling group moving from building to building trying to avoid the vamps, which provides some good suspense, though there are some characters you wish would get offed and thankfully most of them do.There's enough violence to satisfy vampire movie fans, a good amount of gore throughout. The photography is well done too, very dark but not so dark that you can't see whats going on.The editing on the other hand is a little too rapid fire in a lot of places, especially during the sequence where the vamps. attack the town's citizens in a blood filled and choppy fashion.The acting is also 50/50 at best, Hartnett just doesn't emote too well, though he's not horrible here. George is decent, Foster is pretty good and Junior is good too.The actors who play the vampires are okay, but aren't required to do much more than scream really loud, snarl, hiss and look somewhat or not so menacing, but the main vamp. Danny Huston is decent.Logic must be suspended obivously throughout this film,  how do their footprints in the snow and the sounds from the generators not lead the vamps right to wherever they're hiding. But again that may require too much logic for this film.As the film goes on it does drag a bit and the conclusion will probably be met with more laughter than gasps. But this is a cut above most recent horror movies and like I said has some good moments of suspense.",3,"30 Years, I mean Months, I mean 30 Days of Night.",1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,2678,"['Possible', 'Spoilers', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'fun', 'long', 'vampire', 'movie', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name.The', 'basic', 'story', 'place', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'northern', 'most', 'town', 'U.S.', 'where', 'year', 'city', 'darkness', '30', 'days', 'movie', 'actually', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'long', '4-5', 'months.But', 'town', 'darkness', 'band', 'vampires', 'judging', 'accents', 'are', 'Russian', 'country', 'come', 'Barrow', 'disabling', 'towns', 'satellite', 'phones', 'electricity', 'begin', 'chow', 'down', 'town', 'citizens', 'group', 'survivors', 'must', 'try', 'survive', 'sun', 'again', '30', 'days', 'later.There', 'few', 'key', 'characters', 'here', 'including', 'Eben', 'Olson', 'sheriff', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', '40', 'Days', '40', 'Nights', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Melissa', 'George', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Turistas', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Stranger', 'Punisher', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'others.Most', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'various', 'throwaway', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'vamp', 'food', 'die', 'spectacular', 'way', 'Mark', 'Boone', 'Junior', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'good', 'grizzled', 'drunk', 'guy', 'sorts', 'who', 'save', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'pretty', 'decent', 'death', 'scene.The', 'movie', 'ever', 'dwindling', 'group', 'moving', 'building', 'building', 'trying', 'avoid', 'vamps', 'good', 'suspense', 'are', 'characters', 'wish', 'would', 'get', 'offed', 'thankfully', 'most', 'enough', 'violence', 'satisfy', 'vampire', 'movie', 'fans', 'good', 'amount', 'gore', 'photography', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'very', 'dark', 'not', 'so', 'dark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'whats', 'going', 'on.The', 'editing', 'other', 'hand', 'little', 'too', 'rapid', 'fire', 'lot', 'places', 'especially', 'sequence', 'where', 'vamps', 'attack', 'town', 'citizens', 'blood', 'filled', 'choppy', 'fashion.The', 'acting', 'also', '50/50', 'best', 'Hartnett', 'just', ""n't"", 'emote', 'too', 'well', 'not', 'horrible', 'here', 'George', 'decent', 'Foster', 'pretty', 'good', 'Junior', 'good', 'too.The', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'vampires', 'are', 'okay', 'are', ""n't"", 'required', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'scream', 'really', 'loud', 'snarl', 'hiss', 'look', 'somewhat', 'not', 'so', 'menacing', 'main', 'vamp', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'decent.Logic', 'must', 'be', 'suspended', 'obivously', 'film', 'how', 'do', 'footprints', 'snow', 'sounds', 'generators', 'not', 'lead', 'vamps', 'right', 'wherever', ""'re"", 'hiding', 'again', 'may', 'require', 'too', 'much', 'logic', 'film', 'drag', 'bit', 'conclusion', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'met', 'more', 'laughter', 'gasps', 'cut', 'most', 'recent', 'horror', 'movies', 'said', 'good', 'moments', 'suspense']",N/A

1128896,AWQO3BM1FAOZA,B00111YM5Q,"J Smith ""J""","[17, 28]","This movie lacks any valid development of these admired creatures.  Why did they turn their animalistic vampires into philosophers that make observations about human behavior and how to run their operation?  It makes no sense that they would be so careful in planning and then so careless with their food.  If they are so smart in strategy, then why are they so primitive in feeding and making observations?  They waste precious blood by slashing their bait, thus scattering blood everywhere but in their mouths.  They don't even suck their victims dry, even though it took them a likely lengthy time to get to a place that would likely be considered their mecca.  Why do they not seem to be able to track humans with smell?  The first thing said when one of them turned was I can smell your blood, yet the vamps only seem to notice the humans when they make sounds.  The premise of the story is perfect.  There are so many places you can take vampires that they just didn't bother to explore.  Instead of using the opportunity to make vampires interesting, the writers use shock value as their only tool.  Using blood and children in an attempt to frighten us.  The writing lacks imagination and just really doesn't make sense.  The only thing I was impressed with was the look of the vampires, especially when they stood together in black against the white of the snow.  Overall, the movie was just very poorly written.  Honestly, I think it would have been better with a total lack of dialogue.

As one of the reviewers said, the bird's eyeview shots were great and the redness of the blood contrasted well with the snow...until the vampires showed themselves fully. In my case, that could be forgiven. Although Danny Houston (""Marlowe"") could have used more make up. They had a lot of bald vampires which reminds you of Nosferatu or Mr. Barlow from Salem's lot. The girls made to walk on the snow as baits was pretty clever. The vampires standing on the roofs was pretty cool. However, Vampires are supposed to be afraid of fire. I could not understand why Marlowe started to burn the town. I thought it was the way to get Melissa George's (who's the splitting image of Olivia d'Abo [Wonder Years]) character from under the house. If that was the case, then the vampires could have easily taken her from under the house as they previously did in an earlier scene. Also, if Josh Harnett's character knew the way to kill them is to cut of their heads, why didn't they get more axes from the hardware store for his companions to use? But what killed the story was when Josh Hartnett had to become a vampire to defeat the vampires.

1128900,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00111YM5Q,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 3]","For years now the horror genre has been filled with movies that are simply a dime a dozen, very few contain original ideas or break any new ground in terms of thrills and chills (the `Saw' series is somewhat exempt from this notion) and lately it seems that for source material Hollywood horror-masters would rather adapt some film that has already been done in Japan (""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" are good examples of this) instead of looking for inspiration from sources much closer to home. Aside from remaking already successful films from other countries, the only other types of horror films seem to be zombies, and frankly I'm getting to be a little zombied-out, other than the `Resident Evil' series I really don't enjoy those types of movies all that much; so needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that Steve Niles' graphic novel ""30 Days of Night"" would be adapted into a feature film. I have never read the graphic novel, though I have flipped through it and been somewhat intrigued by it, but the fact that the horror genre was trying to look elsewhere for story inspiration got my interest piqued. Not to mention the trailer for the film looked really intense, creepy, and just impressive for a vampire-themed horror film, a sub-genre that needs some new blood injected into it now that the `Blade' series is at an end, and the `Underworld' series seems to have disappeared for awhile at least. However, does ""30 Days of Night"" have what it takes to take back the night or is this an entry into a genre that needs to be staked in the heart?""30 Days of Night"" is set in a small Alaskan town that is preparing for the annual month long plunge into 24/7 darkness. Every year it's the same thing for the people of this town, so all of them know exactly what to expect and what to do to make it through the dreary time of the year; however, this year will be much different from what they are expecting as a deadly group of savage vampires is invading the small town for a veritable vampire paradise as the sunlight will be non-existent for the next 30 days. Doing their best to protect and lead the scared people of the Alaskan town is the local sheriff, Eben Olesen, (Josh Hartnett) and his estranged wife, Stella (Melissa George), who are trying their hardest to make any kind of sense out of their desperate situation, and hoping that they can last out the month long seige.Director David Slade (""Hard Candy"") and his team of writers Steve Niles (who also wrote the graphic novel) and Stuart Beattie (""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"") and Brian Nelson (""Hard Candy"") try their best to not only bring the graphic novel to horrifying reality, but also to show that vampires can be just as captivating to audiences as the living dead. Try as they might, I don't think the director and his writers were completely successful. For the most part the movie is moderately enjoyable, though not memorable by any means, and there were several moments sprinkled throughout the film where I found myself just getting bored by the constant bickering between the survivors and some of the stupid decisions some would make. Now, I know that the survivors were no doubt going stir crazy being cooped up in attics to try to hide from the vampires, but I would think they could have tried harder to get along, especially for the sake of survival, though I guess the writers probably felt that the conflict would intensify the drama rather than make it seem more juvenile.What I did like about the story was that the setting was in Alaska during that area's annual month of darkness (though I believe in reality it is a little longer than a mere 30 days), so unlike most vampire movies where the humans have the advantage during the daylight and the vampires at night to balance things out a bit more, here only the vampires have the true advantage as it is constantly dark, and the human survivors' only advantage is their knowledge of the surrounding area around them. It is this dynamic that works the best in the movie as the vampires mercilessly hunt the humans in their homes, trying to sniff out their hiding places, but the humans use their knowledge of the area homes and hideouts to their limited advantage as they struggle to find supplies and more fortified shelters. Even though I enjoyed this aspect of the story, I did feel that near the end of the movie it became the element that annoyed me the most as the vampires seemed too incompetent to find the last remaining survivors of the town even though they've had ample time to do so, not to mention the fact that the humans bravery/borderline stupidity as they make one last attempt at safety seemed too easily achieved given the vampires superior speed and agility, yet they couldn't seem to catch up to us normal folk, a very strange and unbelievable aspect to the storyline.The actors were for the most part surprisingly strong given the type of movie it was. Josh Hartnett's (""Black Hawk Down"") performance as the local sheriff was one filled with devotion, honor, strength, and courage as he fought to protect those in his charge, yet his love for his estranged wife at times almost put the others in jeopardy as she was his paramount concern. Melissa George (""The Amityville Horror"") was solid as Stella, the estranged wife of local sheriff Eben. She also brought a great strength to her character, and a warmth and calm that soothed the rising frustrations and conflicts amongst the other survivors. The actors portraying the other survivors were a mixed bag of talent and performances, most were good, but a few were a little too bland and forgettable, just like their characters. The standout performance for the entire movie belongs to none other than the chameleon-like talents of actor Ben Foster (""3:10 To Yuma""), who delivers a flat-out creepy character to audiences, as the man responsible for leading the vampire horde to this peaceful town in hopes of becoming one of them. His performance was not only the best in the entire movie, but his scenes were so good, and interesting to watch that I found myself wishing he had been one of the main characters rather than the small supporting role he was given.""30 Days of Night"" is nothing more than an average vampire-themed horror film, that borrows from movies and stories that were executed much better, such as, John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", ""Salem's Lot"", and even the zombie film ""Night of the Living Dead""). There are some interesting concepts featured in the film, primarily the month long darkness and giving the vampires the majority of the advantage in the fight for survival; however, these concepts were not enough to keep me entertained for the duration and in the end I couldn't wait for the credits to begin to roll.""30 Days of Night"" is rated R for violence and language.",3,"30 Days of Fear,

1128901,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B00111YM5Q,- Kasia S.,"[22, 26]","Creepy, eerie, scary and dark, this movie was surprisingly different from most Vampire movies; there are still sharp teeth involved and loss of blood but also many more heart stopping intense moments when the watcher forgets to take the next breath. I won't rehash the premise since everyone here did it so well, but basically a small town on the outskirts of Alaska is about to enter the infamous 30 days of night when the sun rays can't penetrate the dark clouds and snow doesn't seem to cease falling. It's a rough place to live when things are well and even worse when it suddenly falls under attack by a pack of powerful and hungry vampires.The best parts was the hide and seeks games that the survivors had to play, the town sheriff, his ex wife, brother and few friends are on a run from house to house and trying to say alive till the sun comes back. Their only hope of survival is being chopped short each day that they hide and loose more members as the Vampires think of worse methods of setting up traps and picking them out one by one.The movie was a little long but it had plenty of heart stopping moments, it made me worry about the characters and there was plenty of guts and gore for the horror lovers. The death scenes are not for the squeamish, this movie is pretty explicit but I found that it worked in perfectly with the creepy moments when nothing stirred; there was plenty of contrast between fighting and hiding. The ending was very interesting but I had my gripes with it, to say what it was would be spoiling something but I felt that one person's decision was unnecessary. Other than that I had a great time snuggled up in bed watching it, this was one of the few movies I watched today and it was very entertaining.- Kasia S.",4,"Playing hide and seek with Vampires, who will win?",1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,1754,"['Creepy', 'eerie', 'scary', 'dark', 'movie', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'different', 'most', 'Vampire', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'sharp', 'teeth', 'involved', 'loss', 'blood', 'also', 'many', 'more', 'heart', 'stopping', 'intense', 'moments', 'when', 'watcher', 'forgets', 'take', 'next', 'breath', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'premise', 'everyone', 'here', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'basically', 'small', 'town', 'outskirts', 'Alaska', 'enter', 'infamous', '30', 'days', 'night', 'when', 'sun', 'rays', 'ca', ""n't"", 'penetrate', 'dark', 'clouds', 'snow', ""n't"", 'seem', 'cease', 'falling', 'rough', 'place', 'live', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'well', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'suddenly', 'attack', 'pack', 'powerful', 'hungry', 'vampires.The', 'best', 'parts', 'was', 'hide', 'games', 'survivors', 'had', 'play', 'town', 'sheriff', 'ex', 'wife', 'brother', 'few', 'friends', 'are', 'run', 'house', 'house', 'trying', 'say', 'alive', 'till', 'sun', 'back', 'only', 'hope', 'survival', 'being', 'chopped', 'short', 'day', 'hide', 'loose', 'more', 'members', 'Vampires', 'think', 'worse', 'methods', 'setting', 'up', 'traps', 'picking', 'one', 'one.The', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'long', 'had', 'plenty', 'heart', 'stopping', 'moments', 'made', 'worry', 'characters', 'was', 'plenty', 'guts', 'gore', 'horror', 'lovers', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'squeamish', 'movie', 'pretty', 'explicit', 'found', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'creepy', 'moments', 'when', 'nothing', 'stirred', 'was', 'plenty', 'contrast', 'fighting', 'hiding', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'had', 'gripes', 'say', 'what', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'spoiling', 'something', 'felt', 'one', 'person', 'decision', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'Other', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'snuggled', 'up', 'bed', 'watching', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'watched', 'today', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",N/A

Driscoll,"[10, 11]","It seems they only come about once a year.  30 Days of Night, superficially a horror film but truly an action/suspense to the bone, is based on an outstanding comic book miniseries with the same title.  It is directed by David Slade, who brought us the surprisingly suspenseful and unique Ellen Page vehicle Hard Candy.  Although 30 Days of Night is a different type of film, the same all encompassing suspense permeates and Slade is once again very fortunate to have some of the best young actors around today as part of his cast.The film takes place in the isolated village of Barrow, Alaska where the sun annually disappears for 30 days straight.  As the sun sets for the last time in a month, the town Sheriff, Eben (Josh Hartnett), increasingly gets busier and busier over the course of a few hours.  Some peculiar vandalism occurs and some sled dogs are killed.  He investigates and soon stumbles upon a bizarre drifter (Ben Foster) who becomes the film's ""crazy old man"" clich&eacute; character who warns of the town's fate.  Although Foster is of course young, that clich&eacute; may very well be intentional as it probably goes all the way back to the Renfield character in Dracula.  Foster's character is definitely the Renfield of this film, so perhaps he brings the formula full-circle.  Anyway, the townie characters are for the most part likeable and that makes it even more exciting when a ruthless posse of vampires shows up and wreaks havoc on men, women, and children alike.  No punches are pulled as we see Sheriff Eben do his very best to protect the few folks who remain holed up in some old guy's attic.The film has solid performances from Hartnett and Melissa George and I guess they help to anchor the marketing end and make this very good movie some well earned money.  However, others are far better.  Ben Foster convinces this viewer that his performance in 3:10 to Yuma was the real deal.  I think we may be looking at a great actor on the verge of stardom.  Danny Huston, who plays the lead vampire Marlow, contained an amazingly eerie and chaotic emptiness just enough to keep a layer of vulnerability to his host exterior, which was probably a nice businessman out of Anchorage.  He is a great villain.The real winner in 30 Days of Night though is the village of Barrow and its tundra setting.  It represents the northern most settlement in the United States but from what I hear the town wasn't portrayed accurately, nor was the film shot on location.  That's somewhat forgivable because as it turns out 30 Days of Night has a very unique feel and it is a nice looking production overall, especially compared to most horror films.  The sound effects and music were great and some of the aerial shots that Slade creates are unforgettable.  It's like Near Dark meets John Carpenter's The Thing, but I would wager a guess and say that Slade is not a hardcore horror movie buff and despite the aforementioned comparison his film is unique for the genre.  The genre in general is way too derivative and most horror filmmakers are far too celebratory of their peers.  It's like a clubhouse sometimes and the regurgitating of each other's ideas is as acceptable as giving each other their secret handshake.  Slade seems influenced from better films than those of that somewhat tainted genre and his movie is much better for it.  He did his own thing and now horror filmmakers can steal from him.",4,Phew!

I'm Kind Of A ...","[2, 3]","First off, I have never read of the comic book series 30 Days Of Night so none of that will be in my review. As for the film, it wasn't half bad, maybe a little far fetched but not that bad. 30 Days of Night takes place in Barrow Alaska where every year they have 30 straight days of night. Really when you think about it, this is an ideal town for a gory vampire horror film seeing as they could basically feast all day and night without the sun interrupting them. I was very interested to see this after hearing that mega factor. The smart residents usually leave around this time to head south.As the town is settling in for this, a weird stranger comes walking in the town(Ben Foster). His identity is never revealed but he definitely knows exactly what is coming towards the town. He is under the belief that the vampires will make him one of them if he helps sabotage the town before they arrive themselves. The stranger does not hold his tongue when trying to scare the town and they down hesitate to put him away for the night. Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) takes the stranger to a cell but while there the stranger keeps on talking.Finally the evil and incredibly odd looking creatures appear massacreing the towns people and they aren't slowing up. Oleson and others band together trying to plan their way out of this gruesome situation but by the looks of it they will not make it past the first night. With extremely cold temperatures it looks very grim especially when the vampires worst enemy is hibernating for the next 30 days.The best aspect of 30 Days of Night had to be these weird and different vampires. The creators definitely tried to go for something new here. Not the best or scariest vampires but they tried. The story itself was nice, adding the cold and weird Alaskan weather helps add some suspense. The settings and scenarios were great but the acting was so so. I think I mainly take a star from ""30 Days of Night"" is because I really wanted Ben Foster to be the main villain of the film. His character really had no significance at all and if you ask me that is a waste of talent. Really, that is a waste of a guy who can play a great nutcase (""Hostage"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"") just to name a couple. The best actor in the film has almost nothing to work do and it shows that he was needed.

1128905,AISSRJ7E2L375,B00111YM5Q,"Kelly Garbato ""Marchpane!""","[0, 1]","30 DAYS OF NIGHT is based on the first three-issue series of graphic novels by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith (also called ""30 Days of Night"").  I have not yet read any of the graphic novels (according to Wiki, there are 13 series), but after watching the movie, my interest is certainly piqued.  Since I have little knowledge of the novels, my review is only of the movie - not how it compares to the graphic novels, or how it fits into the series as a whole.The story takes place in the isolated oil town of Barrow, Alaska - a town so far north that, for 30 consecutive days each winter, the sun does not rise (hence the title, ""30 Days of Night"").  Anticipating thirty days of uninterrupted darkness, a group of bloodthirsty vampires descends upon Barrow, quickly picking off most of the townspeople.  A brave few, including the local sheriff, Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and Stella, his fire marshal wife (Melissa George), manage to survive, taking refuge in hidden attics and making supply runs to the general store under the cover of blinding blizzards.  The film's climax comes on the 29th day, in the form of a fight between Eben and the head vampire, set amid the backdrop of a town in flames.Overall, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is a good enough horror flick.  The dialogue is a bit choppy at first, but it evens out as the movie progresses.  The acting is solid enough, though no one really delivers a stand-out performance.  The movie's greatest asset is its setting: an isolated town, blanketed with snow and darkness. The blue and grey tones cast on the set and actors are eerily beautiful. The overhead shots, of which there are many, are simply stunning.  The town even looks gorgeous when it's on fire.As for the vampires, they aren't what you'd expect; they're more animalistic than your usual horror movie vamps.  Complete with bat-shaped faces and pterodactyl-like wails straight out of the Cretaceous Period, they resemble alien-animal-Slavic zombie hybrids.  Kind of like James Carville, but more evil (only slightly, though).  One of them even looks like he might be Marilyn Manson's undead cousin.  For the most part, the vampires don't talk, but communicate through wails, screeches, body language and at times telepathy (or so it seems).  The head vampire is allowed several lines of dialogue (all in subtitles...I suspect it's probably Russian, through it sounds a bit like Klingon), and he occasionally reaches the brink of philosophizing, for example, about the existence of god.  Yet, these moments are prematurely truncated.  Consequently, we never really get a sense of the vampires' back story - their origins, their hierarchy, their future plans for humanity.  Which is a shame, since the graphic novels sound as though they do flesh out (pun intended) the vampiric characters in greater detail.Even though the filmmakers failed in personalizing the vampires, I generally enjoyed the movie - up until the last ten minutes or so, that is.  The film's climax is silly and unnecessary.  My quibble isn't with Eben's poor showing in the fight scene; indeed, given the circumstances, you'd expect that the vampires would whip his hybrid arse up and down Main Street.  Rather, the fight (and the plot twist leading up to it) is wholly unnecessary, as the sun rose soon after the climax.  (Like, in a matter of minutes.) Neither Stella nor Eben's hideouts were compromised by the fire, so both could have waited it out.  The whole silly spectacle might possibly have been redeemed it if had been used to set the film up for a sequel - which is what I'd expected - but it didn't seem to easily allow for a second film, at least not involving our hero and heroine.  As a result, the ending was just...weird.  Weird and incomprehensible.

This movie breaks the norm of almost all vampire movies. The Vampires in this movie are smart but are more animalistic than human. The fact that it take place in a town in Alaska where it is night for 30 days really works for this movie and makes different than most vampire movies out there.I will warn you there are some disturbing scenes in this movie especially one involving a little vampire girl.I can see why some people would not like this movie since it does break from the norm of the lore of vampres mythology.

1128907,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00111YM5Q,Kevin Killian,"[1, 2]","Thirty days of night, that's the way vampires like it.  They swarm to Barrow, Alaska, every winter looking for fresh meat.  Too bad there are so many of them, and so few human residents.  That's what I didn't understand about the plot.  In the first thirty minutes or so they massacre nearly 100 people, but then for weeks their pickings are slim, for the savvy men and women, led by Sheriff Eben and his estranged wife, have gone into hiding.Why don't the vampires just leave?  Aren't they hungry?  Danny Huston is great as the head vamp, Marlowe, totally aristocratic and disgusting like Christopher Lee as the Marquis in the Dirk Bogarde version of A TALE OF TWO CITIES.  But Huston, who speaks only in a Romany tongue with extra cackles set it like Ritz crackers speckling a bowl of tomato soup, isn't explaining things one way or the other.  His one philosophy seems to be, If it can be broken, then it is our duty to break it.  Why?  seems arbitrary to me.  Oh well, on the plus side Huston is incredibly chilling, just as menacing as his dad was in Chinatown, and on the human side, well, at first we were rolling our eyes at Melissa George and her incredibly extended lips--they look like glaciers and are nearly as vast.  But soon we had almost forgotten about her collagen because her acting had improved about 1000 times since ALIAS.  I really believed her as the wife who never really wanted to leave Eben in Barrow.  And believe me, she had a lot of acting to do because the screenplay didn't even bother inventing a reason for their estrangement.  Well, there were some child issues, but nothing convincing.  Her lips and eyes told us all we needed to know.As for Josh, well, we aren't used to seeing Josh Hartnett as a man, and the 30 Days of night title reminded me of the old days when he had that wager he could go for thirty days without sex.  Here he had to go for *forty* days, but maybe the distraction of dozens of screaming, keening vampires on your trail will act as a sort of moral saltpeter.  In any case I didn't see him getting it on with anybody, especially not with his wife, and not even with himself, though it was plenty dim up in that old attic and who knows.",4,Thirty Days and Thirty Nights,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,2194,"['Thirty', 'days', 'night', 'way', 'swarm', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'winter', 'looking', 'fresh', 'meat', 'Too', 'bad', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'so', 'few', 'human', 'residents', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'plot', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'massacre', 'nearly', '100', 'people', 'then', 'weeks', 'pickings', 'are', 'slim', 'savvy', 'men', 'women', 'led', 'Sheriff', 'Eben', 'estranged', 'wife', 'have', 'gone', 'hiding.Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'vampires', 'just', 'leave', 'Are', ""n't"", 'hungry', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'great', 'head', 'vamp', 'Marlowe', 'totally', 'aristocratic', 'disgusting', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Marquis', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'version', 'A', 'TALE', 'OF', 'TWO', 'CITIES', 'Huston', 'who', 'only', 'Romany', 'tongue', 'extra', 'cackles', 'set', 'Ritz', 'crackers', 'speckling', 'bowl', 'tomato', 'soup', ""n't"", 'explaining', 'things', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'one', 'philosophy', 'be', 'can', 'be', 'broken', 'then', 'duty', 'break', 'Why', 'arbitrary', 'Oh', 'well', 'plus', 'side', 'Huston', 'incredibly', 'chilling', 'just', 'as', 'menacing', 'dad', 'was', 'Chinatown', 'human', 'side', 'well', 'first', 'were', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'Melissa', 'George', 'incredibly', 'extended', 'lips', 'look', 'glaciers', 'are', 'nearly', 'vast', 'soon', 'had', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'collagen', 'acting', 'had', 'improved', '1000', 'times', 'ALIAS', 'really', 'believed', 'wife', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'wanted', 'leave', 'Eben', 'Barrow', 'believe', 'had', 'lot', 'acting', 'do', 'screenplay', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'inventing', 'reason', 'estrangement', 'Well', 'were', 'child', 'issues', 'nothing', 'convincing', 'lips', 'eyes', 'told', 'needed', 'know.As', 'Josh', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'man', '30', 'Days', 'night', 'title', 'reminded', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'had', 'wager', 'could', 'go', 'thirty', 'days', 'sex', 'Here', 'had', 'go', '*forty*', 'days', 'maybe', 'distraction', 'dozens', 'screaming', 'keening', 'vampires', 'trail', 'will', 'act', 'sort', 'moral', 'saltpeter', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'getting', 'anybody', 'especially', 'not', 'wife', 'not', 'even', 'was', 'plenty', 'dim', 'up', 'old', 'attic', 'who']",N/A
1128908,A1F2EYORWOZ3G1,B00111YM5Q,"Kevin Stanton ""stanke36""","[1, 1]","First I will talk about the good parts.. and they are really good. They took this whole vampire thing seriously in this movie... very seriously. The vampires speak in the old language, dress in the old clothes and behave as a clan. No hocus pocus changing to a bat, wolf or mist.The plot is fantastic and quite original. They send in an accomplice to isolate the town, by means of phone, computer, etc. Then they come in for the slaughter on the first of the thirty days of night.They are aggressive, fast and bloodthirsty. Their goal is to kill the entire town then burn it to make it look like an accident. They are also intelligent.The scenes are believable for an alaskan town, sparse, snow ridden and everyone knows everyone. The relationships between the townspeople seem real also. The action is well paced also.I really liked how the clan moved about on rooftops and used decoys. Great battle strategies and never used in a film like this that I know of.Now the parts I didn't like.The fast-then-slow frame of the camera use is way overdone lately. It only works in certain situations and it didn't work here. It took away from the fine thread of tension that should have been there instead.As mentioned in another review, John Carpenter's 'The Thing' worked so well because the tension was taut and tangible. Not here. There were moments when they were working up to it... but blew it with the shutter tricks.The subplots were a bit on the lame side, but I guess they were okay given the situation of a small town. There's the failed love interest, the younger brother who becomes a hero, the grandmother who's sick. For me, I felt they detracted from the story.I felt the story was the building of a battle ground... the battle.. and who is the victor. These subplots led you astray, for the most part.I will say the ending is also very original and worked very well in this case.All in all it is most definitely a must see for horror, slasher or vampire fans. Most likely, it will be a one time see because there are so many distractions.My question to the people who made this film is... With such a fantastic story line, why did you screw it up with the camera tricks and dead end subplots?

1128909,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00111YM5Q,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 2]","You'd think that at least one vampire would wise up and take advantage of the fact that Alaska spends many a day in the dark.  As far as I am aware, no such fate has befallen the great northern state.  Based on the comic miniseries of the same name, ""30 Days of Night"" gives us a good look at what might happen if a vampire and a few of his undead friends would sink their fangs into the Land of the Midnight Sun.The film opens with the small town of Barrow, Alaska preparing for its month-long dive into darkness (hence the thirty days of night).  Most of the town's citizens are heading for sunnier locations, but a select few stay behind and stick it out.  In this small group is the local sheriff, Eben (Josh Hartnett).  While everyone is getting ready to leave, he's busy investigating a number of strange criminal acts (burning of cellular phones, slaughtering sled dogs, etc.).  As he digs deeper into his investigation, he arrests a stranger (Ben Foster) who begins to wax prophetic about someone or something coming and that no one will survive.Also staying behind (due to missing her flight) is Eben's estranged wife Stella (Melissa George).  She assists Eben in arresting the stranger and goes with the pair to the sheriff's station where Eben's grandmother and brother are.As soon as the sun goes down, chaos reigns supreme.  Eben goes to check on the local telephone office and discovers a brutal murder/decapitation.  Scared, he heads back to town and warns those that stayed behind to hide in their homes.  As it gets darker, more and more people begin to die.  Soon the streets are filled with blood and snow as a gang of vampires feast on the townsfolk.A few survivors of the initial attack (including Eben and Stella) hole up in an attic and make plans to survive for the next month.  The rest of the film shows the small group attempting to stay alive by using their knowledge of the town and the brutal snowfall to their advantage.  Along the way, a few other survivors are picked apart by the vampire group which is headed up by Marlowe (Danny Huston).As supplies become scarce and time begins to wear on them, the survivors take more and more chances in order to stay alive.  This leads up to an eventual standoff with the vampires.  Who lives?  Who dies?  Who finally gets to see the rising sun?  Watch ""30 Days of Night"" and you'll find out.The film's premise is great.  It takes a legendary creature and puts in the one place that gives it seemingly every advantage over its victims.  Isolated, cold, and in complete darkness, the average human would find it hard to survive with limited resources in such environs.  Throw in a gaggle of bloodsucking immortals and you've really got problems.The film's special effects are very good as well.  They are bloody, gory, and very realistic.  The makeup department also did a very good job.Josh Hartnett's portrayal of Eben was very believable.  Unlike the untouchable heroes in many films, he reacts to the initial vampire attacks with fear and confusion.  I actually felt for his character as he tried to make sense of his situation.  Melissa George is fairly convincing in her role as well.  Mark Boone Junior nearly steals the show as Beau Brower, an unlikely hero in the film.Unfortunately, Steve Niles and Stuart Beattie's story drags along at times and lacks a really convincing enemy.  Despite being the leader of the vampire gang and seemingly full of wisdom, Marlowe just isn't that scary.  There's never a moment in this film where I looked at Danny Huston's character and thought, ""There's no way they can stop this guy.""  Whether it was Huston's performance or the direction of Huston by David Slade, I felt that the weak villain was the film's greatest downfall.Despite this, I still recommend ""30 Days of Night.""  While it isn't the best vampire film out there, it is much more loyal to its wicked origins than many of today's modern vampires.  In a time where most bloodsuckers are busy courting teen girls or hanging out at Fangtasia, it's nice to see some truly evil vampires make their way out of the darkness.",3,I'll Take My Blood On The Rocks,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,4098,"[""'d"", 'think', 'least', 'one', 'vampire', 'would', 'wise', 'up', 'take', 'advantage', 'fact', 'Alaska', 'many', 'day', 'dark', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'aware', 'such', 'fate', 'befallen', 'great', 'northern', 'state', 'Based', 'comic', 'miniseries', 'same', 'name', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'good', 'look', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'vampire', 'few', 'undead', 'friends', 'would', 'sink', 'fangs', 'Land', 'Midnight', 'Sun.The', 'film', 'small', 'town', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'preparing', 'month-long', 'dive', 'darkness', 'hence', 'thirty', 'days', 'night', 'Most', 'town', 'citizens', 'are', 'heading', 'sunnier', 'locations', 'select', 'few', 'stay', 'stick', 'out', 'small', 'group', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Eben', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'everyone', 'getting', 'ready', 'leave', 'busy', 'investigating', 'number', 'strange', 'criminal', 'acts', 'burning', 'cellular', 'phones', 'slaughtering', 'sled', 'dogs', 'etc.', 'deeper', 'investigation', 'stranger', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'who', 'wax', 'prophetic', 'someone', 'something', 'coming', 'one', 'will', 'survive.Also', 'staying', 'due', 'missing', 'flight', 'Eben', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Melissa', 'George', 'Eben', 'arresting', 'stranger', 'pair', 'sheriff', 'station', 'where', 'Eben', 'grandmother', 'brother', 'are.As', 'soon', 'sun', 'down', 'chaos', 'reigns', 'supreme', 'Eben', 'check', 'local', 'telephone', 'office', 'brutal', 'murder/decapitation', 'Scared', 'back', 'town', 'stayed', 'hide', 'homes', 'darker', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'begin', 'die', 'Soon', 'streets', 'are', 'filled', 'blood', 'snow', 'gang', 'vampires', 'feast', 'townsfolk.A', 'few', 'survivors', 'initial', 'attack', 'including', 'Eben', 'Stella', 'hole', 'up', 'attic', 'make', 'plans', 'survive', 'next', 'month', 'rest', 'film', 'small', 'group', 'attempting', 'stay', 'alive', 'using', 'knowledge', 'town', 'brutal', 'snowfall', 'advantage', 'way', 'few', 'other', 'survivors', 'are', 'picked', 'apart', 'vampire', 'group', 'headed', 'up', 'Marlowe', 'Danny', 'Huston', '.As', 'supplies', 'become', 'scarce', 'time', 'wear', 'survivors', 'take', 'more', 'more', 'chances', 'order', 'stay', 'alive', 'up', 'eventual', 'standoff', 'vampires', 'Who', 'Who', 'Who', 'finally', 'see', 'rising', 'sun', 'Watch', '30', 'Days', 'Night', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out.The', 'film', 'premise', 'great', 'legendary', 'creature', 'one', 'place', 'seemingly', 'advantage', 'victims', 'Isolated', 'cold', 'complete', 'darkness', 'average', 'human', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'survive', 'limited', 'resources', 'such', 'environs', 'Throw', 'gaggle', 'bloodsucking', 'immortals', ""'ve"", 'really', 'got', 'problems.The', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'are', 'bloody', 'gory', 'very', 'realistic', 'makeup', 'department', 'also', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job.Josh', 'Hartnett', 'portrayal', 'Eben', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'untouchable', 'heroes', 'many', 'films', 'initial', 'vampire', 'attacks', 'fear', 'confusion', 'actually', 'felt', 'character', 'tried', 'make', 'sense', 'situation', 'Melissa', 'George', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'Mark', 'Boone', 'Junior', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'Beau', 'Brower', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'film.Unfortunately', 'Steve', 'Niles', 'Stuart', 'Beattie', 'story', 'along', 'times', 'really', 'convincing', 'enemy', 'being', 'leader', 'vampire', 'gang', 'seemingly', 'full', 'wisdom', 'Marlowe', 'just', ""n't"", 'scary', 'never', 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'looked', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'character', 'thought', 'way', 'can', 'stop', 'guy', 'was', 'Huston', 'performance', 'direction', 'Huston', 'David', 'Slade', 'felt', 'weak', 'villain', 'was', 'film', 'greatest', 'downfall.Despite', 'still', 'recommend', '30', 'Days', 'Night', ""n't"", 'best', 'vampire', 'film', 'there', 'much', 'more', 'loyal', 'wicked', 'origins', 'many', 'today', 'modern', 'vampires', 'time', 'where', 'most', 'bloodsuckers', 'are', 'busy', 'courting', 'teen', 'girls', 'hanging', 'out', 'Fangtasia', 'nice', 'see', 'truly', 'evil', 'vampires', 'make', 'way', 'darkness']",N/A

Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.Small town of Barrow, Alaska (in real life a somehow larger city, with 4212 people registered in 2010) is preparing for its annual ""30 Days of Night,"" a period during the winter when there is a month-long polar night. As the town gets ready, a stranger rows ashore from a large ship and soon causes enough trouble and damage to attract the attention of local sheriff, Eben Oleson (Josh Harnett). Other than this unexpected investigation the sheriff must also deal with another little but annoying crisis, as his ex-wife, Stella Oleson (Melissa George), missed the last plane and must stay the 30 days - something that neither of them is happy with... And then the film really begins.This is not a bad film, but it doesn't fully exploit all the possibilities offered by the unique place of action. The tension is not very skillfully build up, with all things fully revealed too early and the enemies appearing too openly... On another hand the vampire leader, Marlow (Danny Huston) is a quite scary creature - in fact he is one of the main attractions of this little horror movie. His name is almost certainly a tribute to the terrifying Barlow, the master vampire from the already classical Stephen King's novel ""Salem""s Lot"" - and he certainly is as scary and evil (albeit maybe not as sophisticated) as his quasi-namesake...In the second half this film gets repetitive and clich&eacute;d, but at least vampires are shown as cruel, evil and perpetually thirsting for blood, but also as quite efficient and cunning hunters of humans - as they should be... On another hand the finale and the very ending are actually quite original, even a little bit suprising and suprisingly less silly than I expected.So, all in all, this is a quite honest little horror movie, better than most offerings in this overcrowded field, worth seeing once, for John Hartnett, Melissa George and Danny Huston performances and especially for the ending sequence.

This is the Vampires ideal area to hunt, as long as their food choice holds out. Of course this group of vampires does not seem to care about conservation of their food source. The vampires even ask the question we wonder ourselves, why haven't they ventured that far north before. The town in the middle of the ice wasteland must try to last long enough for the sun to rise again. Can they do it, or will the vampires kill all of them?The Alaska landscape is the star of the movie and the one good idea. Even though the vampires do a good job of isolating the town, they are not good hunters. But they are efficient killers. It seems they are only able to find their prey when they do something we would all consider idiotic. Make noise when they know they should be quiet and so on. Most of the vampire rules we know about seem to be followed as too their weaknesses.The previews are much more exciting then the movie.  In an attempt to try and make us care about the characters, too much time is spent on their development that does not advance the plot. The vampires are more like a pack of violent wolves on a rampage. Of course they do not need to be subtle in their hunting in this town since they plan to leave no one alive. They have a unique look with their black eyes and mouth of teeth that is not the norm. And are used for maximum production of blood spray.

1128925,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00111YM5Q,Mark Turner,"[2, 5]","Imagine a write who pens a story for Hollywood only to have it turned down by every studio he takes it to. Undaunted, he knows the story is good so he takes another route. He turns it into a comic book series that becomes a graphic novel. Not only that, the graphic novel is a hit.So much so that the same studios that turned down the original script now offer him more money than he can imagine for rights to that same story. Thus is the tale of Steve Niles and his rise to success with the story 30 DAYS OF NIGHT,released this week on DVD.The story is simple. Barrow, Alaska,the northernmost city in the United States,is on the verge of its yearly plunge into darkness. Due to its location, Barrow faces 30 days of darkness or 30 days of night. Taking this into consideration are a group of vampires, creatures who can only come out at night, who decide to roam free and spend those 30 days enjoying the free flowing blood of the folks of Barrow.While that plot is simple enough, it is surrounded with other stories, most notable the tale of Sheriff Eben (Josh Harnett) and Stella Oleson (Melissa George). Separated from one another, Stella doesn't make it to the airport in time to escape the long winter's night. She returns in time to avoid the initial vampire attack but not to escape it altogether.Also in the picture is a stranger (Ben Foster) who has come to town. With a craving for raw hamburger, he finds himself in jail and teases the sheriff with tales of someone coming. When the power goes out, Eben sets out to investigate with Stella in tow. They are the first to discover the vampires but not the first to fall victim.The streets run red with vampires ferociously attacking the citizens of Barrow, taking them down one at a time no matter what resistance they throw their way. Eventually Eben, Stella, Eben's brother and several other townsfolk find a secret attic in which to hide from their attackers. The days pass and supplies run low, enough so that they are forced to leave their secure location in search of food.Along the way they run into other people who have either been changed, who are being used as bait or who have been hiding just like them. One last hope remains during the last of the 30 days and an eventual sacrifice that yields one of the most touching of love stories brings this film to its conclusion.This movie offers more than simple blood and guts though it drops that in bucketfuls. It's a story of survival, of caring and love. It's a story that shows the determination to hold on and find a solution in the face of the most outrageous adversity one could ever imagine.But at its heart, it IS a horror film. The creatures are some of the most bloodthirsty vampires ever captured on film, led by Marlow (Danny Huston, son of director John Huston).

1128926,AIFNOZKR9WTYI,B00111YM5Q,"mark twain ""25354""","[6, 36]","where to begin?  First, I think it is now axiomatic that it is not possible to make a good vampire movie.  Why?  Come close and I'll tell you.  Let me whisper it in your ear.  ""Because vampires are an utterly self-conscious fictional creature, at all times alleging to be cool and groovy whereas zombies, for example, never are.  This self-conscious coolness always comes across as either smarminess (lounge lizard type vampire) or stupidity.  Or, most frequently, the vampire is both smarmy and stupid, as in Interview With The Vampire.The requirement that vampires be cool is what relegates them to the garbage can of fiction: i.e. nerd literature.  If you want to write an interesting vampire story, there are many problems to overcome.  One is the  nuts and bolts of vampirism, which ordinarily requires a slack-jawed suspension of disbelief.  Then, there's the whole shlock angle: the vampire's well-known behaviors of avoiding daylight and drinking blood... it's a real yawn.  If you want to write an interesting vampire story, it would have to be about a vampire who is totally uncool, doesn't care about drinking blood and doesn't have any problem with daylight.  What's that you say?  Then what makes him a vampire?  Ahh, there's the rub.  Probably the closest thing to real life vampires are junkies.  So maybe a movie should be made about a group of ratty junkies who converge on Barrow Alaska to flop for a month.  They don't got a problem with daylight, but they hate water like cats.  So they get to Barrow, find the methadone clinic.  Find out there isn't one.  Then they scrounge around forlornly,looking for junk.  ""Hey dude, you know where I can score?  You gotta friend in me and if.""  Goddam can't wait hungry junkies.  Once they get it in the vein, whaddo they care?  And USE that alcohol.  Its all I need for pen indef the fuzz rumbles a dirty spoon in my trap.  The Sailor went wrong and hanged hisself in the Tombs.  ""Some things I find myself doing I'll pack in is all.""

1128927,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00111YM5Q,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[2, 4]","In 30 DAYS OF NIGHT, we see what seems like a new take on vampires.  These vampires are nothing like the recent spate of vampire movies that show them as elegant caped Lugosi types, modish punk rockers from BLADE, or even teen gang bangers from THE LOST BOYS. What we see is a more feral, more ancient kind of vampire whose roots predate anything from recorded human history.  As I was watching these vampires, I was reminded of the Wolfen from the movie of the same name.  The Wolfen were wolf type canines that attacked lone humans to consume them.  They were quite frightening because of their passing resemblance to modern canines but in their wolf-like society, we see that they play by their rules which limit them as much as ours do for us.  In 30 DAYS OF NIGHT, the focus is mostly on Josh Hartnet as the sheriff, but he shares almost as much screen time with Danny Huston as Marlow, the leader of the vampires.  The film implies that they are not local residents of Barrow, Alaska, where the title suggests a month long opportunity for vampires to ply their trade.  As the film opens, we see a lone ship stuck in the ice and it is from this ship that we assume is their source.  The vampires speak a strange language, the text of which implies that they are of ancient lineage. They are here in Barrow to feed on flesh. The drinking of blood is strictly secondary.  The movie directly compares these vampires to other movie vampires in that they are vulnerable to sunlight, thus connecting the viewer to an ancestral belief that vampires have a legitimate existence and are subject to the same laws of physics that bind us all.  What I liked about this movie is that they did not change into bats as Lugosi did or could fly as Kiefer Southerland could in THE LOST BOYS. They were simply walking powerhouses whose genetic DNA had been reconfigured to strengthen their physiques, alter their feeding habits, and increase their vulnerabilities in some areas (like sunlight) while decreasing theirs in others (like bullets).  They can, although with considerable effort, be killed or incapacitated. The dramatic center of the film is plot-driven--can the human survivors avoid the vampires for the month of nights? The acting is surprisingly competent and the special effects are more interesting when the focus is not on the vampires themselves.  The camera work of burning buildings and loping vampires in the shadows is riveting. What emerges at the end is the unsettling notion that this planet has a vast source of genetic surprises that we may have seen before but the variations of which are sufficiently novel to imply that humanity, like the Wolfen and these vampires, must share a planet with species that lurk not only in the shadows but also in the real world and in our imagination.",3,More Cannibals than Vampires,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,2800,"['30', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'NIGHT', 'see', 'what', 'new', 'take', 'vampires', 'vampires', 'are', 'nothing', 'recent', 'spate', 'vampire', 'movies', 'show', 'elegant', 'caped', 'Lugosi', 'types', 'modish', 'punk', 'rockers', 'BLADE', 'even', 'teen', 'gang', 'bangers', 'LOST', 'BOYS', 'What', 'see', 'more', 'feral', 'more', 'ancient', 'kind', 'vampire', 'roots', 'predate', 'anything', 'recorded', 'human', 'history', 'was', 'watching', 'vampires', 'was', 'reminded', 'Wolfen', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'Wolfen', 'were', 'wolf', 'type', 'canines', 'attacked', 'lone', 'humans', 'consume', 'were', 'quite', 'frightening', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'modern', 'canines', 'wolf-like', 'society', 'see', 'play', 'rules', 'limit', 'as', 'much', 'ours', 'do', '30', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'NIGHT', 'focus', 'mostly', 'Josh', 'Hartnet', 'sheriff', 'shares', 'almost', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'Marlow', 'leader', 'vampires', 'film', 'implies', 'are', 'not', 'local', 'residents', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'where', 'title', 'month', 'long', 'opportunity', 'vampires', 'ply', 'trade', 'film', 'see', 'lone', 'ship', 'stuck', 'ice', 'ship', 'assume', 'source', 'vampires', 'speak', 'strange', 'language', 'text', 'implies', 'are', 'ancient', 'lineage', 'are', 'here', 'Barrow', 'feed', 'flesh', 'drinking', 'blood', 'strictly', 'secondary', 'movie', 'directly', 'vampires', 'other', 'movie', 'vampires', 'are', 'vulnerable', 'sunlight', 'thus', 'connecting', 'viewer', 'ancestral', 'belief', 'vampires', 'have', 'legitimate', 'existence', 'are', 'subject', 'same', 'laws', 'physics', 'bind', 'What', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'bats', 'Lugosi', 'did', 'could', 'fly', 'Kiefer', 'Southerland', 'could', 'THE', 'LOST', 'BOYS', 'were', 'simply', 'walking', 'powerhouses', 'genetic', 'DNA', 'had', 'been', 'reconfigured', 'strengthen', 'physiques', 'alter', 'feeding', 'habits', 'increase', 'vulnerabilities', 'areas', 'sunlight', 'decreasing', 'theirs', 'others', 'bullets', 'can', 'considerable', 'effort', 'be', 'killed', 'incapacitated', 'dramatic', 'center', 'film', 'plot-driven', 'can', 'human', 'survivors', 'avoid', 'vampires', 'month', 'nights', 'acting', 'surprisingly', 'competent', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'focus', 'not', 'vampires', 'camera', 'work', 'burning', 'buildings', 'loping', 'vampires', 'shadows', 'riveting', 'What', 'end', 'unsettling', 'notion', 'planet', 'vast', 'source', 'genetic', 'surprises', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'variations', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'novel', 'imply', 'humanity', 'Wolfen', 'vampires', 'must', 'share', 'planet', 'species', 'not', 'only', 'shadows', 'also', 'real', 'world', 'imagination']",N/A

But if they did exist, I have a feeling that they'd be a lot more like the horrific, bestial creatures in ""Thirty Days of Night"" and ""Salem's Lot"" than the prettified vampires that Hollywood most often produces for us.Thirty Days of Night really is an excellent horror movie.  The monsters are truly frightening (but not conjurations of special effects).  The setting, a small Alaskan town plunged into a natural darkness that is made unnatural by the presence of the vampires, and the frenetic pace of the action scenes really do work together.  The actors who play the heroic sheriff and the lead vampire give outstanding performances, making the most of relatively thin characters.  My favorite single scene is when a soon to be killed survivor pleads for God's help when she is about to be attacked by the vampires only to be told by their leader that divine intervention is not forthcoming.I only have two criticisms.  First, this movie probably would have done better as a mini-series given the fact that it transpires over thirty days.  Second, it is hard to believe that an Alaskan town, even one as remote as Barrow could fall completely off the grid the way it does in the movie without anyone taking notice in the outside world and coming in to help (perhaps parachuting chaplains from the 82nd Airborne Division in to help).But those are minor criticisms.

1128930,AJUN4M9H1TUOK,B00111YM5Q,"Matt C. Handfield ""madcartoonist""","[4, 5]","You know I didn't read the graphic novel so I'm not doing a comparison, however I am a huge horror movie fan. When the T.V. spots for 30 days of night boast that this is the best vampire movie ever made, then that just gave me another reason to go see it.  To boast that this is the best vampire movie ever made, you have to take into consideration all the vampire movies that have been made From Salems lot, to Interview with a vampire where vampires are more finessed and elegant living the centuries within an aristocracy to the gore fest of From dusk til Dawn where the vampires are blood thirsty brutal killers.  The rules for killing vampires varies from film to film, even from book to book. Garlic, crucifix, and holy water in hand might do the trick in Bram Stokers Dracula, but unless you have faith will fail you in Fright Night or even in the Lost boys.  So keeping that in mind we move to 30 days of night which takes place in Barrow Alaska the northern most town in the state that choked off by 80 miles of Roadless wilderness.  A Town where more than half the population moves away during the month of perpetual night.Vampires systematically trap the remain townsfolk with no escape and no communication.  30 days of night is a gritty look at survival with some pretty brutal vampires.  Because the darkness these vampires are not subtle about their need to feed, pulling townsfolk right out of their houses, through windows, open doors, and chasing them down in the street.  I expected this movies to be at least a little gory. And I must say that I thought that they skimped on the gore in the first half of the film they made up for in the second half.  To me gratuitious blood spray isn't gore.  The latter half of the film has some of the best gore since Planet terror.The Vampires in this film I liked, for one; not a one of them spoke english, if any of them spoke it was sub titled.  Two; they were in vampire form all they way through this movie, unlike other films like Van Helsing, the lost boys, Fright Night, and From dusk til dawn  where the vampires looked like anyone else until they had to feed and then they vamped out and became hideous mutated mouth full of exaggerated fangs vampires.  There were a couple of vampires that just looked silly to me when they communicated. Communication was done in a very bestial way with a series of grunts and howls and hisses.30 days of night didn't follow standard movie formulas, being that there was no comic relief(thank god) and no romantic interest in the classic sense, Josh harnett as the sheriff used to be involved with the character stella(melissa george) but they didn't try to get it on before the end of the movie. It was all about survival.  There is only a couple of other horror movies that didn't use that formula and one comes to mind right away.  John Carpenters the Thing. I also found it a bit amusing that the sheriffs deputy looked like a spitting image of Kurt Russel in ""the Thing"" as MacReady, same beard and long hair.This movie had a couple of continuity problems, and the big one was some of the townsfolk being converted into vampires after the lead vampire ordered all of his minions to kill everyone in town, no  conversions.When I go see a film like this I look for predictability and the beginning of this film was extremely predictable, however as it progressed there were some very pleasant surpises that quashed any of my predictions.This film was dark, gritty,grisly and scary for a vampire film, in a world where dozens and dozens of horror movies have been made about vampires and originality gets thinner and thinner every time.  As intriguing as this movie was, I din't find any part of it boring, Gore I can handle. Boredom thats another story.For those of you looking for vampires that are more finessed, well practiced in the art of the masquerade, and etiquette of blending in and coexisting with the public and only feeding when they need to. You will be disappointed.Bottom Line.......bloody entertaining.  the only thing more that I can ask for is an unrated version when this thing hits dvd.

1128934,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B00111YM5Q,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[0, 0]","30 DAYS OF NIGHT is a great concept in search of a good movie. Unfortunately for the audience, the concept and the good movie never meet.The premise of the movie is ingenious. An isolated factory/oil-pumping town in North Alaska, snowbound and about to enter a cycle of winter in which the sun won't rise for 30 days, is suddenly set upon by a pack of vampires who have decided to turn the place into an all-you-can-eat buffet. With the sun neutralized and the town totally cut off from rescue, the vamps are seemingly invincible. So a local lawman played by Josh Hartnett, finding that fighting back is pretty much useless, tries to gather the surviving townsfolk, which naturally includes his hapless younger brother and the ex-girlfriend he's still in love with, and escape; but inevitably finds himself drawn into a confrontation with the lead vampire.Like I said: the idea behind this movie, which came from a graphic novel, is very intriguing. Unfortunately, it is crippled almost immediately by Josh Hartnett, who is not only inert as an actor and lacking in any kind of chemistry with his ex- (played by Melissa George), but who is totally unconvincing as the town's teenybopper sheriff. This guy is just a good-looking mannequin and nothing more. What's worse, the logical gaps in the story open very quickly and out gushes most of the plot's logic. The vampires cut off the town, which makes sense, but then they immediately massacre every human they can find in a gigantic orgy of blood-letting. In other words, they eat up 99% of their food supply on the very first night, then spend the remaining 29 ""days of night"" looking for survivors. Wouldn't it have made sense to ration the humans so they could feed every day? How long can these monsters go without blood? These are questions the movie doesn't answer, just as it doesn't answer what the vamps do for the month this story takes place when they aren't feeding. They just seem to stand around, unspeaking and looking ominous, while they wait for the human survivors to reveal themselves. Ditto the humans: the survivors are, with the exception of the town's jerk, Beau Brower (Mark Boone, Jr.), flat and uninteresting character-cliches, rather like the machete-fodder one finds in a FRIDAY THE 13th film. Who will live? Who will die? Who the hell cares?Not everything about this film is bad. Danny Huston is, as always, damned good as Marlowe, the creepy human outrider who works for the vampires; and the vamps themselves are anything but glamorous, which is a nice break from glittery pretty boys with teenage angst. There are individual moments here and there of good writing, good acting and effective atmosphere, especially when Huston is on screen; unfortunately none of these pieces coheres into a whole. The movie is often brutally violent but -- and this is a common failing in modern horror movies -- it is never scary; the feeling of gathering dread established in a film like THE THING never comes close to occurring here.Please believe me when I say I wanted to like this movie -- in fact I bought it rather than renting it in the hopes that it would be something I'd return to again and again. Unfortunately it isn't worth a second viewing, and arguably wasn't worth a first. I'd use it as an example of how to spoil a terrific idea with bad casting, a limp script and uninspired filmmaking generally, but not a whole helluva lot else.",2,30 Days of No,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,3417,"['30', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'NIGHT', 'great', 'concept', 'search', 'good', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'audience', 'concept', 'good', 'movie', 'never', 'meet.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'ingenious', 'isolated', 'factory/oil-pumping', 'town', 'North', 'Alaska', 'snowbound', 'enter', 'cycle', 'winter', 'sun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rise', '30', 'days', 'suddenly', 'set', 'upon', 'pack', 'vampires', 'who', 'have', 'decided', 'turn', 'place', 'all-you-can-eat', 'buffet', 'sun', 'neutralized', 'town', 'totally', 'cut', 'off', 'rescue', 'vamps', 'are', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'local', 'lawman', 'played', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'finding', 'fighting', 'back', 'pretty', 'much', 'useless', 'tries', 'gather', 'surviving', 'townsfolk', 'naturally', 'hapless', 'younger', 'brother', 'ex-girlfriend', 'still', 'love', 'escape', 'inevitably', 'drawn', 'confrontation', 'lead', 'vampire.Like', 'said', 'idea', 'movie', 'came', 'graphic', 'novel', 'very', 'intriguing', 'Unfortunately', 'crippled', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'inert', 'actor', 'lacking', 'kind', 'chemistry', 'ex-', 'played', 'Melissa', 'George', 'who', 'totally', 'unconvincing', 'town', 'teenybopper', 'sheriff', 'guy', 'just', 'good-looking', 'mannequin', 'nothing', 'more', 'What', 'worse', 'logical', 'gaps', 'story', 'open', 'very', 'quickly', 'gushes', 'most', 'plot', 'logic', 'vampires', 'cut', 'off', 'town', 'sense', 'then', 'immediately', 'massacre', 'human', 'can', 'find', 'gigantic', 'orgy', 'blood-letting', 'other', 'words', 'eat', 'up', '99', '%', 'food', 'supply', 'very', 'first', 'night', 'then', 'spend', 'remaining', '29', 'days', 'night', 'looking', 'survivors', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'ration', 'humans', 'could', 'feed', 'day', 'How', 'long', 'can', 'monsters', 'go', 'blood', 'are', 'questions', 'movie', ""n't"", 'answer', 'just', ""n't"", 'answer', 'what', 'vamps', 'do', 'month', 'story', 'place', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'feeding', 'just', 'seem', 'stand', 'around', 'unspeaking', 'looking', 'ominous', 'wait', 'human', 'survivors', 'reveal', 'Ditto', 'humans', 'survivors', 'are', 'exception', 'town', 'jerk', 'Beau', 'Brower', 'Mark', 'Boone', 'Jr.', 'flat', 'uninteresting', 'character-cliches', 'rather', 'machete-fodder', 'one', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13th', 'film', 'Who', 'will', 'live', 'Who', 'will', 'die', 'Who', 'hell', 'cares', 'Not', 'everything', 'film', 'bad', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'always', 'damned', 'good', 'Marlowe', 'creepy', 'human', 'outrider', 'who', 'vampires', 'vamps', 'are', 'anything', 'glamorous', 'nice', 'break', 'glittery', 'pretty', 'teenage', 'angst', 'are', 'individual', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'good', 'writing', 'good', 'acting', 'effective', 'atmosphere', 'especially', 'when', 'Huston', 'screen', 'unfortunately', 'none', 'pieces', 'whole', 'movie', 'often', 'brutally', 'violent', 'common', 'failing', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'never', 'scary', 'feeling', 'gathering', 'dread', 'established', 'film', 'THE', 'THING', 'never', 'close', 'occurring', 'here.Please', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'fact', 'bought', 'rather', 'renting', 'hopes', 'would', 'be', 'something', ""'d"", 'return', 'again', 'again', ""n't"", 'worth', 'second', 'viewing', 'arguably', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'first', ""'d"", 'use', 'example', 'how', 'spoil', 'terrific', 'idea', 'bad', 'casting', 'limp', 'script', 'uninspired', 'filmmaking', 'generally', 'not', 'whole', 'helluva', 'lot', 'else']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","30 Days of Night is a bloody but interesting retelling of the old vampire trope: if vampires don't feel cold and can't survive daylight, why wouldn't they all just go to Antarctica in the winter? In 30 Days of Night, that's precisely what happens.Of course, vampires can't just vacation there.  They need to eat.  And since there is an isolated community of humans who maintain the drilling and weather sensing equipment, they're perfect prey for a raid where vampires stalk openly in the streets.The vampires of 30 Days of Night are hardly the pretty-boy effetes we've come to know and loathe.  They are alien, speaking in a guttural dialect known only to them, and they never, ever wipe the blood from their chins. They are also uninterested in creating other vampires, although it's happens anyway.What ensues is an apocalyptic showdown as the vampires, led by their Renfield-like human minion (Ben Foster), tear through the town or Barrow, Alaska as night descends for what seems like an eternity. Our hero and local sheriff Eben Oleseon (Josh Hartnett) and a small band of tough survivors band together, huddled against the cold and living in secret amongst the few uninhabited houses left. Adding to the tension is the hero's pending separation from his wife Stella (Melissa George, wearing snug-fitting tailored polar-wear, but who's complaining?); we never find out why she was planning to leave before the vampire attack, but what might merely be a vacation for some is an act of separation in a town plunged into darkness for a month. Stranded, the two have to put their differences aside for the common good.Advertisement30 Days of Night essentially rewrites the vampire genre by turning the vampires into zombies.  They don't drink blood, they savage corpses, worrying necks with sped-up ferocity. Inhumanly strong, they demonstrate their feral cunning by using humans as lures to capture the remaining survivors.  30 Days of Night revels in putting moral questions before our heroes: will you risk your life to save someone else's elderly father? A confused friend? A little girl?30 Days of Night occasionally loses its way.  The most interesting character is Beau Brower (Mark Boone Junior), a bear of a mountain man, but his exit from the film makes little sense. The tension between the Oleseons is never fully explored - we don't know what caused their breakup so there's never any hope of a true reconciliation.  And Eben's plan seems a little far-fetched.But if 30 Days of Night is occasionally too gory or heavy-handed, it makes up for it by adhering relentlessly to a vision of vampires as predatory cats that are lazy, quick to anger, and very, very cunning.  Thanks to 30 Days of Night, vampires are scary again, and that's no mean feat.",4,One mean feat,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,2760,"['30', 'Days', 'Night', 'bloody', 'interesting', 'retelling', 'old', 'vampire', 'trope', 'vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cold', 'ca', ""n't"", 'survive', 'daylight', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'Antarctica', 'winter', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'precisely', 'what', 'happens.Of', 'course', 'vampires', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'vacation', 'there', 'need', 'eat', 'isolated', 'community', 'humans', 'who', 'maintain', 'drilling', 'weather', 'sensing', 'equipment', ""'re"", 'perfect', 'prey', 'raid', 'where', 'vampires', 'stalk', 'openly', 'streets.The', 'vampires', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'are', 'hardly', 'pretty-boy', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'loathe', 'are', 'alien', 'speaking', 'guttural', 'dialect', 'known', 'only', 'never', 'ever', 'blood', 'chins', 'are', 'also', 'uninterested', 'creating', 'other', 'vampires', 'ensues', 'apocalyptic', 'showdown', 'vampires', 'led', 'Renfield-like', 'human', 'minion', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'tear', 'town', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'night', 'descends', 'what', 'eternity', 'hero', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Eben', 'Oleseon', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'small', 'band', 'tough', 'survivors', 'band', 'together', 'huddled', 'cold', 'living', 'secret', 'amongst', 'few', 'uninhabited', 'houses', 'left', 'Adding', 'tension', 'hero', 'pending', 'separation', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Melissa', 'George', 'wearing', 'snug-fitting', 'tailored', 'polar-wear', 'who', 'complaining', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'planning', 'leave', 'vampire', 'attack', 'what', 'might', 'merely', 'be', 'vacation', 'act', 'separation', 'town', 'plunged', 'darkness', 'month', 'Stranded', 'two', 'have', 'put', 'differences', 'aside', 'common', 'good.Advertisement30', 'Days', 'Night', 'essentially', 'vampire', 'genre', 'turning', 'vampires', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'drink', 'blood', 'savage', 'corpses', 'worrying', 'necks', 'sped-up', 'ferocity', 'Inhumanly', 'strong', 'demonstrate', 'feral', 'cunning', 'using', 'humans', 'lures', 'capture', 'remaining', 'survivors', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'revels', 'putting', 'moral', 'questions', 'heroes', 'will', 'risk', 'life', 'save', 'someone', 'else', 'elderly', 'father', 'confused', 'friend', 'little', 'girl', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'occasionally', 'way', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Beau', 'Brower', 'Mark', 'Boone', 'Junior', 'bear', 'mountain', 'man', 'exit', 'film', 'little', 'sense', 'tension', 'Oleseons', 'never', 'fully', 'explored', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'caused', 'breakup', 'never', 'hope', 'true', 'reconciliation', 'Eben', 'plan', 'little', 'far-fetched.But', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'occasionally', 'too', 'gory', 'heavy-handed', 'up', 'adhering', 'relentlessly', 'vision', 'vampires', 'predatory', 'cats', 'are', 'lazy', 'quick', 'anger', 'very', 'very', 'cunning', 'Thanks', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'vampires', 'are', 'scary', 'again', 'mean', 'feat']",N/A

During this time, most residents leave for parts unknown, but some stay. With the appearance of a stranger in town (demanding raw meat), and darkness fast approaching, there is foreshadowing of very bad things to come. It soon becomes clearly evident that this small town is in deep trouble when the brave and dedicated Sheriff (played by Josh Hartnett) finds a hole filled with burned cell phones and the mutilated bodies of several snow dogs. While he struggles to discover the truth, he also has to deal with the fact that his estranged wife is stranded in town (after missing her flight), and that several people are dependant on him for their survival. As the death count increases, the remaining survivors band together to defeat the evil (seemingly crazed vampires) feeding on their town. With a secret language of their own, scary teeth and a very determined leader, the vampires intend to feed on everyone and everything in town before burning it to the ground. All the remaining citizens have to do is survive for 30 days in a town with no contact from the outside world, darkness, cold and several crazed vampires using every trick in the book to get them to surrender.What I did like about the movie was the imagery (snow, dark and dreary), the anticipation of daylight returning (I loved the whole daily countdown), and the looming presence of evil.  And the final few moments of the movie were absolutely breathtaking.On the other hand, there were two things that I did not enjoy about the movie...namely, the slow moving build-up to the showdown and poor character development.  For example, the methodical creation of anticipation at times took away from the overall flow of the movie. And because of the lack of character development concerning the additional survivors (having been told briefly about the Sheriff's troubled marriage, and seeing the son taking care of his Alzheimer suffering father) we never got to really know them and therefore did not really care about their fate.With all that said, I will say that this movie was definitely not the worse vampire flick that I have ever seen, it just could have been better.",3,Something evil this way comes.,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,2220,"['Barrow', 'small', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'experiences', '30', 'days', 'darkness', 'year', 'time', 'most', 'residents', 'leave', 'parts', 'unknown', 'stay', 'appearance', 'stranger', 'town', 'demanding', 'raw', 'meat', 'darkness', 'fast', 'approaching', 'foreshadowing', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'come', 'soon', 'clearly', 'evident', 'small', 'town', 'deep', 'trouble', 'when', 'brave', 'dedicated', 'Sheriff', 'played', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'hole', 'filled', 'burned', 'cell', 'phones', 'mutilated', 'bodies', 'several', 'snow', 'dogs', 'discover', 'truth', 'also', 'deal', 'fact', 'estranged', 'wife', 'stranded', 'town', 'missing', 'flight', 'several', 'people', 'are', 'dependant', 'survival', 'death', 'count', 'increases', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'band', 'together', 'defeat', 'evil', 'seemingly', 'crazed', 'vampires', 'feeding', 'town', 'secret', 'language', 'own', 'scary', 'teeth', 'very', 'determined', 'leader', 'vampires', 'intend', 'feed', 'everyone', 'everything', 'town', 'burning', 'ground', 'remaining', 'citizens', 'have', 'do', 'survive', '30', 'days', 'town', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'darkness', 'cold', 'several', 'crazed', 'vampires', 'using', 'trick', 'book', 'get', 'surrender.What', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'imagery', 'snow', 'dark', 'dreary', 'anticipation', 'daylight', 'returning', 'loved', 'whole', 'daily', 'countdown', 'looming', 'presence', 'evil', 'final', 'few', 'moments', 'movie', 'were', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking.On', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'namely', 'slow', 'moving', 'build-up', 'showdown', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'example', 'methodical', 'creation', 'anticipation', 'times', 'took', 'away', 'overall', 'flow', 'movie', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'concerning', 'additional', 'survivors', 'having', 'been', 'told', 'briefly', 'Sheriff', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'seeing', 'son', 'taking', 'care', 'Alzheimer', 'suffering', 'father', 'never', 'got', 'really', 'know', 'therefore', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'fate.With', 'said', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'worse', 'vampire', 'flick', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",N/A

1128940,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B00111YM5Q,Mike Zimmerman,"[3, 4]","As the town of Barrow, Alaska enters 30 days of nightfall, vampires arrive and begin their reign of terror, killing everyone in sight. With little time to spare, a group of survivors, led by the town's sheriff (Josh Hartnett) and deputy (Melissa George), must make their way to safety to evade whatever tricks that their leader Marlow (Danny Huston) may have in store.Maybe it's me, but I was taken away with what director David Slade threw upon the screen with ""30 Days of Night"". Based upon a classic graphic novel, this spunky horror thriller doesn't care much about backstory, character development, plot twists, or anything that could get in its way.Following up on the success of ""Resident Evil: Extinction"", another horror film that paid respects to the forefathers of horror (George A. Romero, et al), ""Night"" is able to produce some well-timed shock scares and gory money shots. Of course, not is all perfect, as Slade has a nasty tendency to often shake the camera like crazy (a habit seen in many crap horror films), unable to give us a clear view of what's going on. It's a huge complaint going around the critics, but at least Slade is able to direct flawless scenes of claustrophobia.Another issue I hear is that there's plot holes galore. Good! This is a film of characters trying to survive. If they tried to explain what the vampires were about, it would've ruined the mystery aspect, and making them misunderstood mommy's boys (another cliche in today's rotten horror films). Same with the survivors, who are already worth our attention, that any character development would've sent the film off course.Also good is the cast, which doesn't feature too many famous faces. Credit goes to Ben Foster, who leaves a good mark in the first hour of the film with his hammy, yet chilling performance. I know alot of people hate him and accuse him of being a method-abusing actor, but put him in the right role, and he'll roll with it, coming out like a trooper.Josh Hartnett does a solid job. While he does lose himself in out-of-place acting tics (he's better off as a brooding, yet intense performer, rather than crying on cue), he kicks vampire booty with the best of them. Of course, he's paired with Melissa George, who doesn't leave a lasting impression to get us to care about the personal situation between her and her hubby's personal situations.

The story revolves around the Alaskan town of Barrow, which upon beginning its time of no sun for a month, is attacked by a vicious gang of vampires, led by the demonic Marlow (Danny Huston).  Caught in the middle of all the bloodshed are the town's sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett) and his estranged fire marshall wife Stella (the ever beautiful Melissa George), along with a handful of other survivors (Mark Boone Junior and Mark Rendall among others); all of whom are forced to wait out and survive until the sun returns.  The film is very nicely shot with enough blood and gore tricks to satisfy vampire flick fans and fans of the comic as well.  The only real flaws with 30 Days of Night is that there are a number of predictable moments, but there are a good deal of shocks and scares to cover that up, Brian Reitzell's score is spectacular and creepy, and the film's ending is great to boot.

Much like ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Phantoms"" there is a rapidly diminishing chance of survival in this world of perpetual darkness.Although vampire conventions are followed, Dracula-type wooden stakes and silver bullets are conspicuously absent.  The film's gory visuals are not for the squeamish which is exactly what vampire movie buffs and fans of the original graphic novels will get off on.  ""30 Days of Night""  captures the coolest parts of Steve Niles' graphic novel series on the big screen.  Like the books it is filled with buckets of gore but manages to include a certain intelligence that fans of ""28 Days Later"" and John Carpenter's better movies are searching for but can rarely find. While some horror genre purists will be turned off by all the talking, there is very little actual character development and enough action and suspense for most everyone.There is even a geography lesson as we learn that Barrow, Alaska is the northernmost city in America, and even more isolated and alien during its annual 30 days of continuous darkness. During this period the vampires (who apparently have just discovered this vampire paradise) suck the blood of most everyone in the town. The exception being a small group led by Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his ex-wife Stella (Melissa George), who must wait out the horrifying 30 days of night. The pairing of Hartnett (who has no decernable acting skills) with George (who is quite talented) could have been a disaster, fortunately neither part is particularly challenging so the skill disparity is not too obvious. And who watches these things for the acting anyway.  Also fortunate is the casting of Danny Huston as the vampire leader, he sells his character (i.e. monster).Much like ""Day of the Dead"" and ""Jumanji""  the band of survivors do things to which the average viewer can relate.  They raid a supermarket and hide in an attic.  It's best to stay vague with even the setup for this movie because it takes so many turns, at first seeming to  be one kind of horror film before events move the characters in other directions. The surviving neighbors fight back with some degree of success.  Watch for the town outcast  who uses ""bulldozers for bazookas"",  in the style of Sigourney Weaver operating that forklift robot thing in ""Aliens""..Screenwriters Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson craft characters that don't make stupid decisions and a plot that doesn't turn on unrealistic coincidences. Those who didn't read the graphic novels might find some of the intricate plot turns a bit too cerebral for a mindless night out at the movies and detailed explanations are hard to find.  But at least the filmmakers aren't trying to insult your intelligence.It is nice to find a vampire film that is uncompromising in its violence and yet extremely subtle about its moments of self-parody (watch Hartnett's acting for a few laugh-out-loud moments late in the film).  It's even nicer to find some effort put into realistic action sequences,  not the fake fast cut nonsense that lesser directors use to mask their inability to shoot action scenes.Adding to the terror is having the vampires converse in a demonic language of their own (subtitles are thankfully provided). The vampires move at lightning speed but have little going for themselves in style or culture (there is no ""Underworld"" sophistication here).  There are beheadings, animal violence, the slaughter of children, and a ""Gremlins"" inspired use of a snow plow. Get it on guys.Overall the film is well made, nicely filmed, and competently acted (even with the sometimes painful Hartnett factor).  Obviously this sort of thing is not everyone's cup of tea but is great Halloween fare for those who get off on this kind of stuff.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",5,They're Losing Their Heads In This Town,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,4278,"['have', 'probably', 'guessed', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'vampire', 'movie', 'elements', 'terror', 'self-parody', 'Most', 'parody', 'Josh', 'Harnett', 'painful', 'acting', 'probably', 'accounts', 'particular', 'casting', 'decision', 'very', 'likely', 'year', 'best', 'horror', 'movie', 'coming', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'director', 'David', 'Slade', 'Nasty', 'methodically', 'assault', 'isolated', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'theatre', 'viewers', 'rarely', 'will', 'find', 'moment', 'relax', 'Much', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Phantoms', 'rapidly', 'diminishing', 'chance', 'survival', 'world', 'perpetual', 'darkness.Although', 'vampire', 'conventions', 'are', 'followed', 'Dracula-type', 'wooden', 'stakes', 'silver', 'bullets', 'are', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'film', 'gory', 'visuals', 'are', 'not', 'squeamish', 'exactly', 'what', 'vampire', 'movie', 'buffs', 'fans', 'original', 'graphic', 'novels', 'will', 'get', 'off', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'coolest', 'parts', 'Steve', 'Niles', 'graphic', 'novel', 'series', 'big', 'screen', 'books', 'filled', 'buckets', 'gore', 'include', 'certain', 'intelligence', 'fans', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'better', 'movies', 'are', 'searching', 'can', 'rarely', 'find', 'horror', 'genre', 'purists', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'talking', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'character', 'development', 'enough', 'action', 'suspense', 'most', 'even', 'geography', 'lesson', 'learn', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'northernmost', 'city', 'America', 'even', 'more', 'isolated', 'alien', 'annual', '30', 'days', 'continuous', 'darkness', 'period', 'vampires', 'who', 'apparently', 'have', 'just', 'discovered', 'vampire', 'paradise', 'suck', 'blood', 'most', 'everyone', 'town', 'exception', 'being', 'small', 'group', 'led', 'Eben', 'Oleson', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'ex-wife', 'Stella', 'Melissa', 'George', 'who', 'must', 'wait', 'out', 'horrifying', '30', 'days', 'night', 'pairing', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'decernable', 'acting', 'skills', 'George', 'who', 'quite', 'talented', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'disaster', 'fortunately', 'part', 'particularly', 'challenging', 'skill', 'disparity', 'not', 'too', 'obvious', 'who', 'things', 'acting', 'anyway', 'Also', 'fortunate', 'casting', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'vampire', 'leader', 'character', 'i.e', 'monster', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Jumanji', 'band', 'survivors', 'do', 'things', 'average', 'viewer', 'can', 'relate', 'raid', 'supermarket', 'hide', 'attic', 'best', 'stay', 'vague', 'even', 'setup', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'turns', 'first', 'seeming', 'be', 'one', 'kind', 'horror', 'film', 'events', 'move', 'characters', 'other', 'directions', 'surviving', 'neighbors', 'fight', 'back', 'degree', 'success', 'Watch', 'town', 'outcast', 'who', 'bulldozers', 'bazookas', 'style', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'operating', 'forklift', 'robot', 'thing', 'Aliens', '..Screenwriters', 'Steve', 'Niles', 'Stuart', 'Beattie', 'Brian', 'Nelson', 'craft', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'plot', ""n't"", 'turn', 'unrealistic', 'coincidences', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'graphic', 'novels', 'might', 'find', 'intricate', 'plot', 'bit', 'too', 'cerebral', 'mindless', 'night', 'out', 'movies', 'detailed', 'explanations', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'least', 'filmmakers', 'are', ""n't"", 'trying', 'insult', 'intelligence.It', 'nice', 'find', 'vampire', 'film', 'uncompromising', 'violence', 'yet', 'extremely', 'subtle', 'moments', 'self-parody', 'watch', 'Hartnett', 'acting', 'few', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'late', 'film', 'even', 'nicer', 'find', 'effort', 'put', 'realistic', 'action', 'sequences', 'not', 'fake', 'fast', 'cut', 'nonsense', 'lesser', 'directors', 'use', 'mask', 'inability', 'shoot', 'action', 'scenes.Adding', 'terror', 'having', 'vampires', 'converse', 'demonic', 'language', 'own', 'subtitles', 'are', 'thankfully', 'provided', 'vampires', 'move', 'lightning', 'speed', 'have', 'little', 'going', 'style', 'culture', 'Underworld', 'sophistication', 'here', 'are', 'beheadings', 'animal', 'violence', 'slaughter', 'children', 'Gremlins', 'inspired', 'use', 'snow', 'plow', 'Get', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'nicely', 'filmed', 'competently', 'acted', 'even', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'Hartnett', 'factor', 'Obviously', 'sort', 'thing', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'great', 'Halloween', 'fare', 'who', 'get', 'off', 'kind', 'stuff.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",N/A

The Thing. If after watching that excellent horror movie you still have a taste for blood in the snow, then 30 Days of Night does its best to resurrect what has been a dying vampire genre.An Alaskan town that goes through 30 days of night finds itself hiding from a band of vampires who have managed to infiltrate their social network, cutting off internet, burning mobile phones (hurray!) in preparation for a slaughterhouse. These vampires are of the untamed type, have their own language, drag people from their houses screaming, even without an invite.However, it is pretty much run-of-the-mill, hide from the monsters, watch people and vampires die in the most horrific ways we can imagine, lots of blood on the snow and a finale which sees the good guy do something unique to help save the day.The film itself is based on the cult graphic novel of the same name. It's a cut above the rest, but those expecting another graphic novel turned movie extravagance like `300', or genuine frights, may be disappointed by the lack of both, replaced instead by a focus on head meets hatchet gore and lots of high-pitched vampire wailing.

Based on the Graphic novel ""30 Days of Night""Barrow Alaska., the Northern most town in the United States is plunged into darkness for 30 days each year as the tilt of the earth changes keeping the sun below the horizon. The town prepares itself for darkness each year but Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) has noticed some strange occurrences on the last day of sunlight and received strange complaints from the locals. He goes to investigate one of the occurrences as his partner goes to pick up the Sheriff's estranged wife Stella Oleson (Melissa George) as she has managed to miss the last flight out of town due to a car accident. The Sun sets and the town begins 30 days of night......This was an interesting and intense new take on the trite and overdone vampire story. I am not even a fan of horror films but ""30 Days of Night"" was surprisingly good. The vampires are not the stereotypical kind we have gotten used to seeing and this ""New breed"" brings a very intense story along with it. I did not read the graphic novel so I can't speak on how well or accurately it was adapted to film.The Good: A great original take on vampires. Their look, the way they talk, and the way that attack and kill is new and intense. The look of the movie was good. The acting was solid all around. The story was a great idea with the vampires discovering a town where they can roam free for 30 solid days and any hope for their potential human victims is a long time away. No punches were pulled, as this movie was an intense ride.The Bad: I was slightly disappointed with the end. It wasn't a bad ending and didn't have a negative effect on the movie as a whole, I was just hoping for a slight different ending. I don't want to give spoilers so I won't go into detail.Overall: Pick up ""30 Days of Night"" and give it a shot.

This movie puts a fresh new take on the whole vampire genre. The movie starts a little slow but once it picks up the pace it does a good job of entertaining you. The blood and violence are pretty gory at times, with axes chopping off heads to the vampires sucking the blood violently out of their victims. Josh Hartnett (who plays Sheriff Eben Oleson) does a great job in this movie as the main character. If you love vampire movies you will either love the fresh take this movie offers, or you will hate how it strays from the traditional vampire movie. I personally have not been a big vampire fan but I did actually enjoy this movie. The cinematography is truly breathtaking with Alaska and the snow as the beautiful backdrop. I will not give away the ending but I will say I was a bit disappointed and would have liked to know more about what happened to the vampires.

Shortly after a stranger enters a small town in Alaska, right around the time they will have complete darkness for 30 days, a horde of vampires ravages the town, and it is up to Josh Harnett and a small band of survivors to rid the town of the vampires before they are killed themselves and the vampires can move on to another town.The vampires in this movie are almost zombie-like. We are not told how they came to be vampires, and although they look human, were they a normal human at some point? Gone is the typical two fangs in the mouth, and the normal yet ghostly eyes. These vampires have pitch black eyes and a mouth full of pointed fanged teeth. Except for the leader, who speaks in a foreign language, they communicate via shrieks and screams. With the theory that crucifixes and garlic and holy water will kill them usually seen in most vampire movies, they are not seen here.

Plus, I went into this one expecting a horror movie - that's not what this is.Having said that, though, I did find myself enjoying ""30 Days..."" for what it is - an action-packed, well-directed, reasonably well-acted action movie with a Vampire theme running through it.The plot concerns a small, isolated Alaskan town which, since it spends thirty days of each year in total darkness, is the perfect picnic for a marauding gang of Vampires, led by Marlow (Danny Huston). Young Sheriff Oleson (Josh Hartnett), along with his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) must save the handful of hardy survivors by waiting out their month of darkness hidden from Marlow's gang.Director David Slade, hot off the success of the excellent Hard Candy (2005), does himself a huge service by keeping special effects to a minimum, and concentrating instead on some brilliantly-directed action sequences to create the fear and tension for the audience. The vibrancy of the attacks and sense of isolation that Slade manages to put across in ""30 Days..."" are very strong, and make the elements of this film (bog-standard plot, B-list actors, so-so script) into something much stronger than the sum of its parts.Not that there's much bad acting: Huston, Hartnett and George all do their best with a limited script and premise, and are, for the most part, very good. Similarly, Huston's gang of Vampires are effective enough at creating fear and tension, and the relative realism with which some of the plot elements are presented (the hunting scenes, the heirarchy within the Vampire coven) adds more depth and believability to a movie premise that could, in the wrong hands, have descended into campy parody.While ""30 Days of Night"" has its problems - not least of which is the overconvenient sequence of events leading up to an extremely predictable ending - it's still a worthwhile action thriller, and not the worst way you could find of passing almost-two hours. Apparently the comics are better: I haven't read them so I can't comment on that.

The short version of the storyline is that you have a small town in Alaska that is facing a month of night time when a few miles away you have a derelict ship crewed by vampires that are on their way to the town.  The first thing you will see is that these vampires act more like wolves than the vampires you usually see in the movies like Dracula or read an books like Interview With The Vampire.  Along through the movie when the vampires start attacking is when the blood really starts to flow.  Again unlike most of the other movies of vampires the scenes in the movie have them basically goring and almost tearing apart their victims. While this movie won't have any nudity some viewers might be looking for the violence and carnage will definitely make up for it.  The one thing I also loved about this blu-ray dvd was the picture quality and audio and while I didn't get the standard dvd to compare this one with I still am amazed at the quality of this dvd.

1128969,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00111YM5Q,RMurray847,"[7, 12]","Film has CONTINUITY problems.  Big time!!  So much so, that I was scratching my head in frustration for the last half.First things first, there are parts of the film to like.  The essential premise is OUTSTANDING.  A group of vampires invade Barrow, Alaska as it descends into a 30 day long nighttime.  Can you imagine the joy of vampires who don't have to escape from the sunlight for a month!!  They sure do enjoy their time in Barrow!I also liked the early scenes as we see how the vampires and their human assistant (played by the wonderfully over the top Ben Foster, who also nearly stole 3:10 TO YUMA) slowly cut off the town from the outside world.  They basically set themselves up a full ""all you can eat"" buffet.  The vampires themselves were kinda cool, a mixture of sophisticated (they wore tasteful black and white formal wear) and bloody (they all ALWAYS had big red smears of blood on their faces).  I never quite got just exactly what kind of vampires we were dealing with, because unlike other similar legends, these vampires wasted most of the blood.  Barrow, covered in white snow, was soon splotched with huge red frozen puddles of blood EVERYWHERE!  While it looked good from a graphic standpoint, I kept wondering why they wasted so much blood.  That was never explained.  Finally, I was fairly impressed with Danny Huston as the main vampire.  As he showed in THE PROPOSITION, this is a guy who can convey malice quite effectively.After most of the town is decimated, we are left with a somewhat standard ""small group of people trapped in a confined space trying to stave off the zombies...whoops, I mean vampires.""  Josh Hartnett is the only recognizable face (he's the sheriff).  He seems pretty bored by his role.  Anyway, the group decides to move from one building to another.  For no good reason!!  They start out in the attic of a house, and quite frankly, as long as they stay there, the vampires apparently will never find them.  Sure, it's boring...but it appears to be safe.  But they eventually decide to move on.  They state they are going to a utility building...but first they go to the general store.  They end up spending some days there...but we don't know why.  It sure doesn't seem safe, since they are now on ground level.  Anyway, eventually they go the sheriff's office...for NO GOOD REASON.  And finally, with about 1 day left before sunrise, they make the final break for the utility.  Each time they move, it's just an excuse for drawing the vampires out to kill one or two characters.  There is no sense to it.And no good sense of how much time is passing is established.  There's no CONTINUITY!  Occasionally a title will come on the screen telling us how much time has passed...but otherwise, the whole movie could just have easily taken place on the first night the vampires arrived.  We get no sense of the days going by.  No idea of how the group lives from day to day.  It bugged the heck out of me!And finally, when they are ""safe"" in the utility house, with only minutes before sunrise, Hartnett decides to take the battle to the vampires, in a way that makes for an interesting fight scene, but which makes NO SENSE!  To say it is stupid and pointless doesn't even begin to describe it.And don't you love it when one character sacrifices himself or herself, while the people being sacrificed for stand and watch instead of running and hiding.  The person IS giving  his/her life for them after all.  The least they could do is make the sacrifice worthwhile.  And this happened a couple of times in the film.There were also a couple of moments (such as when suddenly several major characters are hiding in the local diner) when the film appeared to have jumped ahead a reel of film.  Although I could fill in the blanks in my head as to what must have happened, there were clearly scenes missing.  But I'm glad they were missing, because the movie was long enough as it is.So, while there were a few things to admire...I have to say that the film was mostly a mess.

As the opening credits were going by, to music that can best be described as an example of industrial (real industrial, not this dance-music stuff) and dark ambient, I fully expected to see Graeme Revell's name come up as the man behind the music. Instead, it's relative newcomer Brian Reitzell (The Virgin Suicides, CQ) doing his best early Revell impersonation, and I have to say, he does it really, really well. Even when the movie wasn't quite getting me, as happened a little too often for my tastes, Reitzell's music never failed. This kid's got himself a strong, strong future.As for the movie itself, I spent the whole thing thinking ""you know, I can probably justify blaming all its shortcomings on Steve Niles and exonerating Slade across the board,"" and I still haven't convinced myself otherwise two weeks later. What Slade (and Niles' co-writers Stuart Beattie, of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and Brian Nelson, who previously worked with Slade on Hard Candy) brings to the table is coherence, something that Niles' original graphic novel sorely lacked; what Niles brings is atmosphere. When the two combine, the results should be phenomenal. And in some ways, they are. The vampire makeup is exceptionally done, bringing back the age when vampires were not sexy, not slinky, and above all not us. Marlow (Children of Men's Danny Huston), the lead vampire, is presented to us as sophisticated, noble, but decidedly inhuman. It's great stuff. He should've gotten a movie all to himself. Instead we get, well, the rest of this bunch.Plot: Barrow, Alaska, is located at the northernmost tip of Alaska, above the arctic circle, and every winter, the town is shrouded in darkness for an entire month. (Barrow, by the way, for those of you unaware, actually does exist, and really does get dark for that long; on the other side of the year, there's an entire month of light, a subject that was amusingly explored in an episode of the TV show Northern Exposure). A group of vampires, led by the aforementioned Marlow, decide that it would be an excellent place to stop in for a snack; after all, they'll have thirty days to cavort in the open, with no retreating to coffins for daylight every eight hours or so. After a first bloody night, a small band of survivors, headed by the town sheriff, the painfully-named Eben Oleson (The Black Dahlia's Josh Hartnett), and his estranged wife Stella (Turistas' Melissa George), have to figure out how to hold out until the sun rises again.The movie really, really wants to get into the dynamics of family, both with the Eben-and-Stella subplot and Even's interaction with his younger brother Jake (Silk's Mark Rendall), but that's one of the many places this script falls short. There are some painfully large areas of sheer stupidity inserted for dramatic effect (this is yet another human-transformation script that can't seem to figure out how long it takes people to turn into other, as has been pointed out with great comedy in many other reviews), there are subplots that disappear, there are a couple of relatively minor plot holes. But when everyone involved gets behind the idea of making a survival-horror movie, everything clicks. Slade and his cohorts are very good at alternately creating tension and blowing stuff up, and they do both with sadistic glee. (Some of the setup kinda blows, but one comes to expect this sort of painful obviousness from American big-budget horror films.) As an action flick, you can't beat it. Too bad there's all the other stuff in the middle.As for the technical aspects of the film, they are, in general, superior in every way. (The main exception is the acting, which ranges from the sublime (Ben Foster, who's rapidly making a name for himself with movies like The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things and 3:10 to Yuma) to the ridiculous (Hartnett, who manages to make his Black Dahlia character seem like a masterpiece of stagecraft in retrospect).) I grant you, when the majority of your script takes place at night in the middle of a town, it's pretty hard to screw up the cinematography and sound, but it's good stuff. And that soundtrack. Man, that soundtrack. It's worth the price of admission by itself. ***",3,"Could have been worse, but could have been so much better.",1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,4446,"['30', 'Days', 'Night', 'David', 'Slade', '2007', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'be', 'said', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'first', 'big-budget', 'flick', 'maverick', 'indie', 'director', 'David', 'Slade', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'really', 'have', 'start', 'soundtrack', 'opening', 'credits', 'were', 'going', 'music', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'example', 'industrial', 'real', 'industrial', 'not', 'dance-music', 'stuff', 'dark', 'ambient', 'fully', 'expected', 'see', 'Graeme', 'Revell', 'name', 'come', 'up', 'man', 'music', 'Instead', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Brian', 'Reitzell', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'CQ', 'doing', 'best', 'early', 'Revell', 'impersonation', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'really', 'well', 'Even', 'when', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'getting', 'happened', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'tastes', 'Reitzell', 'music', 'never', 'failed', 'kid', 'got', 'strong', 'strong', 'future.As', 'movie', 'spent', 'whole', 'thing', 'thinking', 'know', 'can', 'probably', 'justify', 'blaming', 'shortcomings', 'Steve', 'Niles', 'exonerating', 'Slade', 'board', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'otherwise', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'What', 'Slade', 'Niles', 'co-writers', 'Stuart', 'Beattie', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'franchise', 'Brian', 'Nelson', 'who', 'previously', 'worked', 'Slade', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'table', 'coherence', 'something', 'Niles', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'sorely', 'lacked', 'what', 'Niles', 'atmosphere', 'When', 'two', 'combine', 'results', 'should', 'be', 'phenomenal', 'ways', 'are', 'vampire', 'makeup', 'exceptionally', 'done', 'bringing', 'back', 'age', 'when', 'vampires', 'were', 'not', 'sexy', 'not', 'slinky', 'not', 'Marlow', 'Children', 'Men', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'lead', 'vampire', 'presented', 'sophisticated', 'noble', 'decidedly', 'inhuman', 'great', 'stuff', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'movie', 'Instead', 'get', 'well', 'rest', 'bunch.Plot', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'located', 'northernmost', 'tip', 'Alaska', 'arctic', 'circle', 'winter', 'town', 'shrouded', 'darkness', 'entire', 'month', 'Barrow', 'way', 'unaware', 'actually', 'exist', 'really', 'get', 'dark', 'long', 'other', 'side', 'year', 'entire', 'month', 'light', 'subject', 'was', 'amusingly', 'explored', 'episode', 'TV', 'show', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'group', 'vampires', 'led', 'aforementioned', 'Marlow', 'decide', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'place', 'stop', 'snack', ""'ll"", 'have', 'thirty', 'days', 'cavort', 'open', 'retreating', 'coffins', 'daylight', 'eight', 'hours', 'so', 'first', 'bloody', 'night', 'small', 'band', 'survivors', 'headed', 'town', 'sheriff', 'painfully-named', 'Eben', 'Oleson', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Turistas', 'Melissa', 'George', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'hold', 'out', 'sun', 'again.The', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'get', 'dynamics', 'family', 'Eben-and-Stella', 'subplot', 'Even', 'interaction', 'younger', 'brother', 'Jake', 'Silk', 'Mark', 'Rendall', 'one', 'many', 'places', 'script', 'short', 'are', 'painfully', 'large', 'areas', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'inserted', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'yet', 'human-transformation', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'long', 'people', 'turn', 'other', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'great', 'comedy', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'subplots', 'disappear', 'are', 'couple', 'relatively', 'minor', 'plot', 'holes', 'when', 'everyone', 'involved', 'idea', 'making', 'survival-horror', 'movie', 'everything', 'clicks', 'Slade', 'cohorts', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'alternately', 'creating', 'tension', 'blowing', 'stuff', 'up', 'do', 'sadistic', 'glee', 'setup', 'kinda', 'blows', 'one', 'expect', 'sort', 'painful', 'obviousness', 'American', 'big-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'action', 'flick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Too', 'bad', 'other', 'stuff', 'middle.As', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'general', 'superior', 'way', 'main', 'exception', 'acting', 'sublime', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'who', 'rapidly', 'making', 'name', 'movies', 'Heart', 'Deceitful', 'Above', 'All', 'Things', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'ridiculous', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'make', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'character', 'seem', 'masterpiece', 'stagecraft', 'retrospect', 'grant', 'when', 'majority', 'script', 'place', 'night', 'middle', 'town', 'pretty', 'hard', 'screw', 'up', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'good', 'stuff', 'soundtrack', 'Man', 'soundtrack', 'price', 'admission', '***']",N/A

1128977,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B00111YM5Q,Ron Sullivan,"[14, 23]","Before I saw '30 Days ...' I was really excited for it when I learned that it was going to be directed by David Slade.  I'd previously seen the film 'Hard Candy' (with a stellar Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson) and was looking forward to seeing what an intelligent director such as himself would do with a vampire movie.  I always thought it was encouraging to see film-makers try and branch out and do something different.At its core, the general concept for the film is also one that I found interesting.  Basically a brood of vampires descend on a northern Alaskan where, in the winter, night lasts a month.  There hasn't been a really good vampire film in awhile and I thought '30 Days ...' had the set-up to be pretty good.I was horribly disappointed that the film fails on almost every level.For all the talent that's involved here, I was surprised that this was such a ""stupid"" film.  Unfortunately, that disappointment extends even down to the concept, which I was originally so excited about.  In hindsight, given the thick of this information age we live in (where telecommunications, cell phones, email, text messages, etc dominate our lives) I could never really buy into the idea that this town was just completely cut off from the outside world.  Looking back, if it were up to me (and it's not) I'd have made the suggestion that this would work better as a period piece.  Setting everything in the 1800's or even the early 1900's, for example, would make it easier to buy into the idea that the town was completely isolated for the winter.The script is a total disaster from front to back.  In my opinion, more then anything else, for the concept that was laid out to be successful, '30 Days ...' had to accomplish just three tasks.1.  Especially in light of the title, you absolutely HAD TO SEE a believable passage of one month's time.2.  You had to be able to get to know the characters that were trapped and left as survivors.3.  To later appreciate the cat-and-mouse game being played between the vampires and the towns-people, you HAD to have a general idea of how the town was laid out.That lack of an understanding of the geography of the town is frustrating because we never seen to have any clear idea of how difficult it would be to get from one point to another.  When the survivors are talking about changing locations, are they talking about a point that's right next door, or completely across town?  I would have fixed this with a single-shot pan with the camera (a la the classic opening of 'Touch of Evil') in the beginning of the film to let the viewer know what's where.  Maybe pass over the town in a helicopter in the opening ...Worse though, is the complete lack of any sense of time.  This would be a difficult hurdle to jump over for this film, since there isn't any rising or setting of the sun.  Everything in the movie feels like it was taking place over a couple of hours though, not days.  For example, there never seems to be a concern over supplies or food, there's surprisingly little tension in the group, and outside of a half-arsed looking beard here or there, nobody looks as if they hadn't shaved, showered or changed their clothes.  Without a genuine sense of the passage of time, it takes a mountain of the tension and sense of dread off the situation these characters are facing.Speaking of characters, outside of Melissa George and Josh Hartnett, there's virtually zero character development here at all.  I can tell you, with absolute honesty, that (not including the above) I can't recall the name of one person that lived in Barrow.  This again, takes any of the emotional impact off a scene such as the vampire siege.  If we don't know who the characters are that are being killed, how much do we really care?Although they're certainly not done any favors with the script, the performances here are all bland at best and awful at worst.  The only exception, for me, was the Renfield-like harbinger that comes to the town.  Even his character doesn't make any sense though.  If your film's vampires are going to be portrayed as a feral group of animals, that's fine.  But why then, would anyone aspire to join them?  These aren't the romantic Bram Stoker-type vamps, these are what amounts to a pack of wild dogs.I'm sorry to say that nobody decided to rise to the occasion on this one.  Although it's well-shot (the Blu-Ray version looks amazing), the whole film's a complete mess.  It gets my lowest possible recommendation.",1,Skip it ...,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,4484,"['saw', ""'30"", 'Days', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'when', 'learned', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'directed', 'David', 'Slade', ""'d"", 'previously', 'seen', 'film', 'Candy', 'stellar', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'intelligent', 'director', 'such', 'would', 'do', 'vampire', 'movie', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'encouraging', 'see', 'film-makers', 'try', 'branch', 'out', 'do', 'something', 'different.At', 'core', 'general', 'concept', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'found', 'interesting', 'Basically', 'brood', 'vampires', 'descend', 'northern', 'Alaskan', 'where', 'winter', 'night', 'lasts', 'month', ""n't"", 'been', 'really', 'good', 'vampire', 'film', 'awhile', 'thought', 'Days', 'had', 'set-up', 'be', 'pretty', 'good.I', 'was', 'horribly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'almost', 'level.For', 'talent', 'involved', 'here', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'such', 'stupid', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'disappointment', 'even', 'down', 'concept', 'was', 'originally', 'so', 'excited', 'hindsight', 'given', 'thick', 'information', 'age', 'live', 'where', 'telecommunications', 'cell', 'phones', 'email', 'text', 'messages', 'etc', 'dominate', 'lives', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'buy', 'idea', 'town', 'was', 'just', 'completely', 'cut', 'off', 'outside', 'world', 'Looking', 'back', 'were', 'up', 'not', ""'d"", 'have', 'made', 'suggestion', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'period', 'piece', 'Setting', 'everything', '1800', 'even', 'early', '1900', 'example', 'would', 'make', 'easier', 'buy', 'idea', 'town', 'was', 'completely', 'isolated', 'winter.The', 'script', 'total', 'disaster', 'front', 'back', 'opinion', 'more', 'then', 'anything', 'else', 'concept', 'was', 'laid', 'out', 'be', 'successful', ""'30"", 'Days', 'had', 'accomplish', 'just', 'three', 'tasks.1', 'Especially', 'light', 'title', 'absolutely', 'HAD', 'TO', 'SEE', 'believable', 'passage', 'one', 'month', 'time.2', 'had', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'were', 'trapped', 'left', 'survivors.3', 'later', 'appreciate', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'being', 'played', 'vampires', 'towns-people', 'HAD', 'have', 'general', 'idea', 'how', 'town', 'was', 'laid', 'out.That', 'lack', 'understanding', 'geography', 'town', 'frustrating', 'never', 'seen', 'have', 'clear', 'idea', 'how', 'difficult', 'would', 'be', 'get', 'one', 'point', 'When', 'survivors', 'are', 'talking', 'changing', 'locations', 'are', 'talking', 'point', 'right', 'next', 'door', 'completely', 'town', 'would', 'have', 'fixed', 'single-shot', 'pan', 'camera', 'la', 'classic', 'opening', ""'Touch"", 'Evil', 'beginning', 'film', 'let', 'viewer', 'know', 'what', 'where', 'Maybe', 'pass', 'town', 'helicopter', 'opening', 'Worse', 'complete', 'lack', 'sense', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'hurdle', 'jump', 'film', ""n't"", 'rising', 'setting', 'sun', 'Everything', 'movie', 'feels', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'couple', 'hours', 'not', 'days', 'example', 'never', 'be', 'concern', 'supplies', 'food', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'tension', 'group', 'half-arsed', 'looking', 'beard', 'here', 'there', 'nobody', 'had', ""n't"", 'shaved', 'showered', 'changed', 'clothes', 'genuine', 'sense', 'passage', 'time', 'mountain', 'tension', 'sense', 'dread', 'situation', 'characters', 'are', 'facing.Speaking', 'characters', 'Melissa', 'George', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'virtually', 'zero', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'can', 'tell', 'absolute', 'honesty', 'not', 'including', 'above', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'name', 'one', 'person', 'lived', 'Barrow', 'again', 'emotional', 'impact', 'scene', 'such', 'vampire', 'siege', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'really', 'care', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'not', 'done', 'favors', 'script', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'bland', 'best', 'awful', 'worst', 'only', 'exception', 'was', 'Renfield-like', 'harbinger', 'town', 'Even', 'character', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'vampires', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'portrayed', 'feral', 'group', 'animals', 'fine', 'why', 'then', 'would', 'anyone', 'aspire', 'join', 'are', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'Bram', 'Stoker-type', 'vamps', 'are', 'what', 'amounts', 'pack', 'wild', 'dogs.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'nobody', 'decided', 'rise', 'occasion', 'one', 'well-shot', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'amazing', 'whole', 'film', 'complete', 'mess', 'lowest', 'possible', 'recommendation']",N/A

While many flee the darkness for Anchorage, others stay behind to weather the long night.  As the sun sets on our film, the sheriff is called out to investigate the brutal slaying of every available sled dog in town; a puzzling and disturbing occurrence in a small quiet town.Night falls, and the vampires come out to play.  They're ugly, deadly, and very thirsty.  These are real vampires, evil and blood-driven, not the obscene domesticated vampire who wants to help humanity or the romanticized vampires of Rice and Hamilton's silly erotica novels.  Their gory invasion is swift and thorough, leaving behind very few survivors.  Those left must huddle together, hidden in various houses around the town as they wait for the far off dawn.  The gore level escalates as the survivors discover that those bitten must be beheaded in order to keep them dead.  Survival seems doubtful as the long night wears on, and the vampires just keep coming.The best part of this movie is the vampires.  I must say that they're pretty sloppy eaters, leaving lots of blood strewn about in the wake of their feasting, their mouths and clothing dripping with blood, and still gushing meals abandoned.  You got to love those inky black eyes, though, and the way they keep the gore level up to entertaining levels.  The survivors, however, seemed a bit wooden.  Their dialogue was weak, and the characters not fully developed.  This made it harder to identify with their plight.  The scenes of the desolate town were adequate, but the soundtrack was also weak, not helping to build any suspense around the predicament of the survivors.Over all, I was gratified enough by the vampires to make this an enjoyable horror flick.

Josh Hartnett gives a solid performance as the sheriff trying to save his beleaguered town from the onslaught of a band of screeching vampires lead by neck-craning Danny Huston, who appears to enjoy his role. However, despite the effective set pieces, and the unusual setting, this is pretty derivative stuff. There are also some rather self-conscious, clunky moments and some trite dialogue.

It stars Josh Hartnett - who still can't act. But that, for the most part, is OK.  Melissa George can, though neither actor is given the greatest dialogue.  Which brings me to Danny Huston as the main vampire.  Huston's version of the undead  is like some existential character from Dostoevsky's ""The Possessed,"" spouting vampiric nihilism while ripping people apart.  In a very dark way, that's pretty cool.  He becomes the dark heart of the movie, and makes the movie worth seeing.  Essentially, as others have pointed out, 30 Days is a siege movie, one that will have you recalling Carpenter's ""The Thing."" Carpenter's movie is better (and Kurt Russell is WAY better than Hartnett), but siege movies usually work - and I think 30 Days mostly works.  The main problem I had with 30 Days, was the sense that some of the story was left on the editing room floor.  Characters pop up in a way that suggests we should know them, but I was left wondering just who they were.  (For example, the little girl wandering down the street around day 27.)  Muddy and/or confusing scenes.  The Director's cut may clarify some of these questions.  3  stars - but I'll round up due to the impressive look of the film(the director can certainly frame a scene).

I went online and read about Barrow, and also found out besides that, that the town is not realistically depicted either.Next, these vampires are smart enough to go to Barrow and cut power, but they run around like idiots when attacking or dealing with vehicals that are attacking them: thus getting themselves killed in some of those situations.How on EARTH did a stranger in a town where everyone would for sure know each other, get into town, steal all the satellite phones and make off with them: stupid. And how did he kill all the dogs in town: no way...they would make too much noise that people would attend to. Also, why didn't other people come to Barrow wondering why no one contacted them after at the maximum 20 days in. Also, can the vampires smell blood or not...why could the girl not hide under the truck longer...seemed fine. And what about people getting away from them...are they fast (seemed to be), until Eben is running from them...then he can cut some corners and lose them?Why does is carry a Berreta pistol as a sherif up there...a stainless .357 would be much better in the wildernes of that area? Why didn't they get more axes from the store? Why didn't they get in a car and drive away...or just stay in the house or police station for longer...it seemed to be working just fine?Also, I would have liked to know more about the vampires...where did they come from, etc?That's it, venting is now over...Finally, I would like to say thanks to Olivia for thinking of me and how I would be a good choice of protection if she was in this situation.

Once the comic came out, even studios that had originally rejected the movie pitch were knocking down the 30 Days creators' doors to get the film rights (according to a 10/18/2007 IGN.com article).Anyway, when I looked up 30 Days at Amazon, I found that more than just one version existed. There is the original30 Days of Night; there is #2 calledDark Days; and there is #3 calledReturn to Barrow. There are even more in the series too, but the above three complete the trilogy created by the original partnership of Niles & Templesmith.The film adaptation is an adaptation only of the original 30 days of Night comic book. It's the story of vampires that invade a small town (called Barrow in Alaska) at dusk on the first evening of 30 days before the sun will rise again. And while the film adaptation removes an entire storyline from the comic, the film adaptation still holds strong as a good vampire movie.Steve Niles co-wrote the screenplay, so a lot of the comic book's story-integrity is fully intact. But the removed element did turn what was an excellent vampire story and turned it into a good vampire story. Anyone who hasn't read the comic obviously won't notice a thing and may even think that this is still indeed a great vampire movie. I was just so surprised that the removed element, that changes a key factor, didn't make the film.The acting in the movie is mostly fair. There are some good scares, and Director David Slade captured a lot of the original creepiness that was created by Niles & Templesmith. Overall the movie made for an entertaining 2 hours.So the movie doesn't really 'bite' like others have said it does. It's good.

Ideal hunting time for vampires wouldn't you say?This is the premise of this film and couple with shrieking, misshapen headed vampires, this makes for one tense and gory film. There is plenty of blood and gore, as well as tension when a group of townsfolk (headed by Josh Hartnett as the sheriff) hole up to see out the 30 days until the sun rises again.Hartnett is actually very good in this role and surprised me after seeing him acting so woodenly in other films. The plot twists are a touch predictable in places, but then this is a horror film and it has to cater to the genre at some points. The ending isn't what I expected at all though, especially from an American film, and it was all the better for it.This is a pretty decent vampire film and one of the better horror films I have seen in a while.

1128994,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B00111YM5Q,Steffan Piper,"[4, 7]","Spoilers below ...I think the main problem that most people have with this movie so far, judging from the overall reaction, not just here, or at Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb, but overall -- is that everyone was expecting a larger than life delivery of a horror film, rather than what it was, which was nothing more than another run-of-the-mill Zombie horror flick. Those that were most let down seemed as if they were waiting to see anotherSalem's Lotat the End of the World, or aDoctor Zhivagomixed with The Head-Chewing Undead or aThe Thingwith nasty fangs. But, to quote a famous  Beach Boys' lyric ... God only knows.Problem No. 1:The real curious aspect of the film was that it was supposed to be set in Barrow, Alaska on the North slope, which is a town predominately settled by people who work on the Oil Pipeline or for the Oil Companies doing engineering work.  While they dramatized the coming 30 days of darkness, which actually occurs more gradually than actually shown, and is the setting for some good Vampiric / Zombie material, everyone leaving town to avoid the darkness is complete bunk. Fine, it's a movie. But once the chaos begins, the place just drops of the map and no one notices? Sorry, don't think so.Problem No. 2:Unfortunately, this film seems to start dissolving as soon as the on-screen text tries to explain what goes on up in the Last Frontier State. Having been a resident of that State for a large block of my life, I can tell you whole-heartedly how disappointed I was that again - they didn't shoot in Alaska, and that again - they went overseas and built up a ridiculously large set instead of just shooting in Barrow, Alaska. Which was entirely feasible. This seems to be the Hollywood kiss of death with allfilms about or set in Alaska, when they don't bother shooting the movie in Alaska at all. The only movie that differed from this pattern wasInsomnia, with Al Pacino, which did very well and most people enjoyed -- and yes, they shot on location in Alaska. This formula should start to serve as a warning to filmmakers who do this, but repeatedly they seemingly take no heed. Much like the silly blonde who wanders off into the darkness for no apparent reason in films like this.Problem No. 3:Another problem in the beginning was the continuity. The characters began talking about scenes and events that had occurred that were never established on screen for the viewer. It's ok to do this, if you can do it with grace and be convincing, but the way it was done here, was just ham-handed. I would suspect that the actual footage was shot, but deleted due to studio time constraints on the film's run-time (113 mins). A Director's Unrated Special Edition Cut is bound to hit shelves so they can double dip on you sometime soon, be ready. The scene's in question can be witnessed by watching the Diner scene in the beginning where they say: ""We kept shooting at them and nothing happened."" It was never established. Sorry, but you need to establish the rules of your world for the viewer. You cannot depend on folklore from other movies to fill in the blanks. Expository speeches after the fact, are bad ideas and even worse writing.Problem No. 4:So, we're just supposed to suspend our disbelief about a smelly vagrant drifter, covered in grime and dried blood, and his ability to sneak into town and actively select the people who are not leaving and steal their cell-phones? What, he has special abilities and powers, but cannot best Josh Hartnett with a pistol? This was pretty bad writing to say the least. While a burning pile of cell-phones might look cool, you need to at least develop the idea to some level of credibility - regardless of the world in which you move.Problem No. 5:Yeah, the philosophical Zombie Vampires was pretty weak considering that they had 30 days and didn't bother to hunt more efficiently, like most subsistence hunters, which is what a Vampire really is, -- or rather would be. They had a Vietnam style of slash-and-burn, `damn-it-all-to-hell' attitude that made no sense in consideration of their `moral high-ground'. It's probably just the film trying to do too many things while failing to actually accomplish anything at all. The Vampires were so badly developed I was beginning to believe, as were others in the room, that these freaks might've been space aliens or something fromDreamcatcher.Problem No. 6:Yet another film that Josh Hartnett thinks that it's his trademark to whisper through. I know I'm not the only one beginning to notice this. I'm not saying it's bad or good -- and I'm not knocking him as an actor, because he's pretty good; considering the lack of talent in Hollywood these days, but it's just beginning to be something that people remark on now with every one of his films. Maybe, by default, the subtitles should come on anytime he's in a movie.Final Thoughts:The concept of this is what made this film enticing to a lot of people, and in all honesty, it's standard viewing fare for this genre. Not bad, but not exceptionally good either. It had some original ideas which could've been better served spending more time in script development. And why must all female Vampires wear18 hole lace-up Dr. Marten Boots? Haven't we seen enough of this kind of thing? The chick should've been wearingSorel's,Uggsor something that would actually keep her feet warm, even if she was a member of the undead.Verdict:Yeah, this is probably another film forPatrick Starto watch when he's bored to salty tears.",3,Josh Hartnett dies in a Pineapple under the Sea ...,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,5495,"['Spoilers', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'most', 'people', 'have',

1128996,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00111YM5Q,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 1]","A savage vision of vampires is unleashed in 30 Days Of Night, veering sharply from either haunting atmosphere or gothic grandeur to bring on a horde of utterly vicious, predatory bloodsuckers.  The small town of Barrow is the most northerly community in Alaska, so far north that in the dead of winter nights become so long and days so short that once a year it enters 30 days of uninterrupted darkness.  During this annual nightfall, much of the town's population of 800 heads south, leaving basically a skeleton crew of inhabitants.  The local oil refinery shuts down and the remaining citizens hunker in to wait out the night.On the last day of brief daylight, several miles out from Barrow by the Arctic waters, a massive, battered cargo ship appears. Unseen inland, where most of the residents have either left or are preparing to leave (many to larger communities in southern Alaska, from which they'll return in a month), the ship waits for night, while the only human passenger of the vessel makes his way inland to Barrow.  Once there he stealthily cuts off the only ways the townspeople would have to leave once night falls.  Barrow is 80 miles from the nearest community; it has no paved roads leading that distance, relying on strong offroad tractors and plows.  The stranger sabotages these (the ones that didn't leave with the majority of the citizens), kills the dogs that pull the dogsleds, and wrecks the helicopter operated by the small tourism business.  The stranger is found and locked up, but he's not what people really have to worry about; he was just making sure the buffet couldn't get up and leave.  And as darkness settles in, on the outskirts of Barrow, the vampires begin with their strikes, leading up to a massive all-out assault by a swarm of the creatures.  Even if anybody survives the initial slaughter, there's still a full month of night to go...The vampires are horrific creatures; they look, in ways, more rat-like than the bats with which they're often associated.  As they dart along the rooftops getting ready to pounce on their prey below they're reminicent of rats scurrying along darkened ledges.  The special effects and innovative cinematography are outstanding, the musical score distinct and memorable, and the performances universally exemplary.  30 Days Of Night actually features one of 2007's best impressive overall displays of acting, although I doubt any mainstream critic would want to admit that of any movie this firmly in horror territory.  Strong characterization plus a presentation of the vampires that makes them both supernaturally powerful but constantly believable, round out one of the best vampire movies ever made.The disc also features the first episode of the horror anime series ""Blood Plus"", the follow-up toBlood - The Last Vampire.  Just judging from this, the series is off to a good start, although the actual animation is a bit more basic than in ""Last Vampire"".

1128998,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00111YM5Q,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[37, 46]","A clever new take on an old genre, but it is far longer than it needed to be which ended up making the graphic violence more mind-numbing than scary or intense.Amazon did a fine job giving us a synopsis of the story wherein our most northern Alaskan community which suffers through 30 days of night is besieged by vampires.  While this is a fun graphically violent, atmospheric, and generally well-acted horror flick, it really doesn't deserve much more from me than my hits and misses evaluation.The Misses:(1) Overly long by about 30 minutes.  One becomes disconnected to the characters and plot after so much violence for such an extended period of time as the violence is rather repetitive in nature.(2) Tissue paper thin plot even though it was a clever take on an old genre.(3) Too many people wondering in and out from nowhere in what is supposed to be a very small isolated town.(4) The lack of a real climax and any kind of satisfying resolution.(5) A completely silly and nonsensical fight scene near the end that is supposed to be our climax, but is laughable, uninspiring, and just down right stupid.(6) For all the cleverness of this film, the vampires are still reduced to  simply screaming animals and often we just get these long shots of them doing just that.  It seems endless and rather grating on the nerves after awhile.Hits:(1) The film is very nicely acted by all involved making the characters seem real in a very unreal situation.  That really helps a film in this genre.(2) The camera work is exceptional and I'm not referring to special effects and make up which are very good, but rather the actual camera movement and angles which create atmosphere, tension, and genuine creepiness.  The best shot of the entire film is a straight down shot from above as the legion of vampires literally massacre the town.  It is absolutely bone-chilling.(3) A clever concept that re-invigorates an old genre.(4) The set designs are excellent and reminds one of John Carpenter's version ofThe Thing (Collector's Edition).In the end, this film comes off as more style than substance and forgive the pun here, but it was overkill of a good idea.  I think fans of this genre will love it for what it is and those with only a passing interest in vampire films may be less impressed.  I liked it overall, but just felt disappointed when it was over as the film really lacked punch at the end which became confused, out of focus in its inept attempt to be climatic and heart wrenching at the same time.",3,30 Days of Night is about 30 minutes too long.,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,2509,"['clever', 'new', 'take', 'old', 'genre', 'far', 'longer', 'needed', 'be', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'graphic', 'violence', 'more', 'mind-numbing', 'scary', 'intense.Amazon', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'giving', 'synopsis', 'story', 'most', 'northern', 'Alaskan', 'community', '30', 'days', 'night', 'besieged', 'vampires', 'fun', 'graphically', 'violent', 'atmospheric', 'generally', 'well-acted', 'horror', 'flick', 'really', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'much', 'more', 'hits', 'evaluation.The', 'Misses', '1', 'Overly', 'long', '30', 'minutes', 'One', 'disconnected', 'characters', 'plot', 'so', 'much', 'violence', 'such', 'extended', 'period', 'time', 'violence', 'rather', 'repetitive', 'nature', '2', 'Tissue', 'paper', 'thin', 'plot', 'even', 'was', 'clever', 'take', 'old', 'genre', '3', 'Too', 'many', 'people', 'wondering', 'nowhere', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'small', 'isolated', 'town', '4', 'lack', 'real', 'climax', 'kind', 'satisfying', 'resolution', '5', 'completely', 'silly', 'nonsensical', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'supposed', 'be', 'climax', 'laughable', 'uninspiring', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'stupid', '6', 'cleverness', 'film', 'vampires', 'are', 'still', 'reduced', 'simply', 'screaming', 'animals', 'often', 'just', 'get', 'long', 'shots', 'doing', 'just', 'endless', 'rather', 'grating', 'nerves', 'awhile.Hits', '1', 'film', 'very', 'nicely', 'acted', 'involved', 'making', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'very', 'unreal', 'situation', 'really', 'film', 'genre', '2', 'camera', 'work', 'exceptional', ""'m"", 'not', 'referring', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'up', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'rather', 'actual', 'camera', 'movement', 'angles', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'genuine', 'creepiness', 'best', 'shot', 'entire', 'film', 'straight', 'down', 'shot', 'legion', 'vampires', 'literally', 'massacre', 'town', 'absolutely', 'bone-chilling', '3', 'clever', 'concept', 'old', 'genre', '4', 'set', 'designs', 'are', 'excellent', 'one', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'version', 'Thing', 'Collector', 'Edition', '.In', 'end', 'film', 'off', 'more', 'style', 'substance', 'forgive', 'pun', 'here', 'was', 'overkill', 'good', 'idea', 'think', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'love', 'what', 'only', 'passing', 'interest', 'vampire', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'impressed', 'liked', 'overall', 'just', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'film', 'really', 'lacked', 'punch', 'end', 'became', 'confused', 'focus', 'inept', 'attempt', 'be', 'climatic', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'same', 'time']",N/A
1128999,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00111YM5Q,Steven Reynolds,"[1, 1]","As the sun sets on Barrow, Alaska, for its annual month of arctic night, the town is beset by a series of sabotages which soon escalate into violent attacks. Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and Stella (Melissa George), his estranged fire-marshal wife who is trapped in Barrow when she misses the last plane out, quickly discover the town is being invaded by vampires. With no sunlight to save them for another 30 days, they and the usual rag-tag bunch of disposable companions have an impossible fight on their hands... Beautifully shot by Jo Willems this film's visual style is the best thing about it. It really is an exquisite-looking failure. What's missing is any real tension or suspense. The setup is wonderful, but the plotting is lame. Once the terrified locals figure out what's afoot, there's nothing driving the plot but the obvious and rather non-narrative urge to bunker down and wait it out. As it happens, that's surprisingly easy given the vampires seem to have amazing physicality but no common sense. There are cheats aplenty, with the survivors wandering through blizzards and somehow magically moving from building to building with ease, when at other times they dare not open the door for fear of attack. The size of both the town and the band of blood-suckers seem to change for convenience. There's very little in the way of innovation from the survivors, who only rarely lock-on to what this kind of story always requires of them: ""Hey, let's figure out what these creatures are, what kills them, and what we might be able to do with what little resources we have!"" The climax is unmotivated and absurd. Similarly, the love story has a nice setup but isn't used, except as the pretext for a feeble romantic ending that seems shoe-horned into place. Hartnett plays himself, as always. George has nothing to work with, and Danny Huston is a rather boring villain, mainly because the screenplay gives him no complexity and nothing to do. When director David Slade hits his stride with some action set pieces, he shows he has talent. But again, the screenplay gives him scant opportunities to show his stuff. This really is a squandered chance to do something fresh with a promising spin on an old genre.

In the small town of Barrow, Alaska - the northernmost town in the U.S - Sheriff Eban Oleson (Hartnett) keeps tabs on the quiet inhabitants. Barrow is about to descend into a month of darkness, and the gloom brings some unwelcome visitors - a gang of vicious, itinerant vampires.

There are a lot of things to admire: Slade brings an overbearing sense of isolation, something akin to The Thing or Alien, and keeps the tension high throughout, while throwing in some truly gruesome deaths (that beheading will stick in the mind for some time) and inventive shots (the aerial view of the street battle).

(in much older tales of vampires then good ole bram stoker we get foul, not living not dead *hence undead* and they were NOT something you would want to become.) here we have the same sort of thing. and the vampires do not fly etc they creep and hunt. and all of this fits with a creature such as this. a great film in line with oldies like subspecies. I really would hate having to spend 30 days of darkness (night) with these vampires.also the fact that you never seem to have the full story lends to the creepy feeling this film gives.it would seem a band of ancient evil vampires has chosen a quiet alaskan town to feast upon and they have 30 days of darkness to survive until the sun returns and drives the evil ones away. and while the story might be thin at best, it is a good film and I thought I would most likely be hiding if these things came to my town and I Love Vampires....But these are not the lovable type, cool though they are. I also thought them using an ancient language was good for a new twist and the fact they weren't really chatty (mostly screams and screeches) definately made the sinister atmosphere of the film even more creepy. I also really liked the fact that guns could kill them (via head removal) and the sunlight exposure scene was excellent. so if you are truly up for a horror filled vampiric thrill ride, I would recommend this film.4 stars from me the Fanatic.Buy it here on DVD.30 Days of NightOr UMD for the Sony PSP.30 Days of Night [UMD for PSP]",4,Finally!

1129011,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00111YM5Q,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 3]","Sinister, brutal, and unrelentingly violent, 30 Days of Night is the best vampire movie - and likely best horror movie - to be unleashed upon audiences this year. As fear and dread gradually give way to full-blown terror as the ruthless vampires descend upon the isolated town, the audience is never given a moment to catch their breath. No one is safe and seldom does a sliver of hope surface in the rapidly diminishing chance of survival in this world submersed in darkness. Though the story grounds itself in preconceived vampire mythos, the visuals do not, and a masterpiece of bloody violence emerges, revealing such intensely vicious imagery that fans of the genre (as well as the original graphic novel) will revel in the carnage.In Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost city in Alaska, once a year during the winter, the sun disappears for 30 days. Isolated by 80 miles of ice and snow, the town prepares for the lightless month. But a group of blood-starved vampires have made their way into the shadowy environs of Barrow to feast on the town, concerned only with satisfying their feeding frenzy. Quickly killing off the majority of townsfolk, the vampires hunt for a small remaining group of survivors led by Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his wife Stella (Melissa George), who must wait out the horrifying 30 days of night.It is refreshing to see a vampire film that doesn't shy away from violence and that doesn't dwell on anything that can be even remotely construed as hokey. A new cinematic creature, 30 Days of Night's antagonists are ultra scary with their deformed appearances and their mercilessly gut-wrenching killing sprees. They speak in their own demonic language and have super human strength and speed, making them a Michael Myers fashioned juggernaut. High-pitched shrieks, blood-soaked visages and razor-sharp fingernails complete a frightening design of this force to be reckoned with.The character designs are not just notable for the vampires, but also for Eben and Stella, who are brilliantly portrayed by Josh Hartnett and Melissa George. 30 Days of Night is not just about brutal vampire melees, but about sacrifice and protecting loved ones regardless of the dangers. Particularly powerful scenes continually arise as the struggling survivors are forced to cede to unbearable situations to ensure the survival of others. Eben too must make difficult choices to provide leadership for the group and to preserve his fragile relationship with his wife Stella. While it's difficult to judge authentic reactions to a vampire outbreak, the characters all perform honestly and emotionally to any event that could just have easily been grounded deeper in reality.From beheadings to animal violence, to the slaughter of children, to maniacal misuse of a snow plow, 30 Days of Night douses you in blood and suspense. A few minutes into the film we are immersed in quick, gritty violence and intensity and it never lets up until the climactic conclusion.

1129012,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B00111YM5Q,the masked reviewer,"[1, 3]","One has to admire the creators of the graphic novel 30 DAYS OF NIGHT. Wow! To our knowledge, even Stephen King never thought up this premise. A town in Alaska is plunged into darkness for thirty days of night every winter and a group of enterprising vampires seize this opportunity to ring the dinner bell.Great idea.We have no idea how the graphic novel handled this, but the problem with the film is that the characters are set upon almost immediately by the bloodsuckers and the devastation begins in ernest. This leaves absolutely NO time for any backstory to develop and we never really get the chance to get to know any of our heroes. (There is a very sketchy broken marriage between the sheriff (Josh Hartnett) and his estranged fire marshal wife (Melissa George) but we are never really filled in on why they are at odds and so the whole things seems rather superfluous.)It all starts very well with the arrival of the Renfield-like Ben Foster, who has been sent on ahead to make certain that there will be no method of outside communication or escape once his vampiric masters arrive but as soon as the bloodthirsty tribe does get to town, character development and even plot twists seem to have been thrown aside for spurting blood and very little else. Then all we are left with is the survivors, running from building to building, trying not to end up as the next meal while their numbers dwindle down to a precious few. Unfortunately, with no character development, those few that are left to fight it out are absolutely meaningless to us as they are thoroughly interchangeable.Even the vampires are dull. They have nasty rows of sharp protruding teeth and razor sharp fingernails that can do equal amounts of damage, but they also are extremely feral (only one of them seems to possess the ability to speak and quite frankly he seems a tad lethargic most of the time. ) Worse, they seem to have no particular REAL game plan other than to feed. (This is fine for a George Romero Zombie movie, but we have come to expect a bit more from our fanged undead over the years. Even Romero's films offer more substance than this turkey.) With only 152 people left in the town during the 30 days, and with the feverish fury that these screeching undead are doing away with that small number, just how to they plan to get home once they have done away with everyone? (They arrived by ship but quickly do away with the human servant who did all of their bidding - the one who paved their way there. One can only assume that the plan must ultimately be to stay in the descimated village and starve to death after their sport is very quickly done!)It is one of those films that calls up question after question as you watch (not the least of which is, ""Okay - So NOW what?"") And when you see that there are NO answers forthcoming the whole simplistic premise begins to fold in on itself until you practically have lost interest. At one point, a newly turned vamp says to a human, ""I can smell your blood."" If this is the case, with so many vampires lurking about with keen senses of smell, wouldn't hiding seem fruitless? Yet our human friends get into a building and the vamps become the worst hide-and-go-seekers ever!All this could be overlooked if there were at least one plot twist. But since the vamps remove the heads of all their victims, (as not to increase their number), we really don't even get the delicious SALEMS'S LOT-like premise of undead friends and family returning to do harm to former loved ones. The ending seems like an absolute cop out. Wasn't there a million other things that they could have come up with? The return of Daylight... That nasty bone crunching machinary.... ANYTHING BUT the lazy final confrontation the filmmakers settled for. And the final shot, clearly designed to elicit both sympathy and revulsion, manages to do neither.30 DAYS might be fine enough for a rental - especially for those younger vampire film completists that simply MUST see every undead film ever made, but for those of you with discriminating tastes, you may just want to wait for this one to pop up on cable one day.It can wait.",2,An Original Premise Becomes A Missed Opportunity,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,4142,"['One', 'admire', 'creators', 'graphic', 'novel', '30', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'NIGHT', 'Wow', 'knowledge', 'even', 'Stephen', 'King', 'never', 'thought', 'up', 'premise', 'town', 'Alaska', 'plunged', 'darkness', 'thirty', 'days', 'night', 'winter', 'group', 'enterprising', 'vampires', 'seize', 'opportunity', 'ring', 'dinner', 'bell.Great', 'idea.We', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'graphic', 'novel', 'handled', 'problem', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'set', 'almost', 'immediately', 'bloodsuckers', 'devastation', 'ernest', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'time', 'backstory', 'develop', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'heroes', 'very', 'sketchy', 'broken', 'marriage', 'sheriff', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'estranged', 'fire', 'marshal', 'wife', 'Melissa', 'George', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'filled', 'why', 'are', 'odds', 'so', 'whole', 'things', 'rather', 'superfluous', 'very', 'well', 'arrival', 'Renfield-like', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'ahead', 'make', 'certain', 'will', 'be', 'method', 'outside', 'communication', 'escape', 'vampiric', 'masters', 'arrive', 'as', 'soon', 'bloodthirsty', 'tribe', 'get', 'town', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'plot', 'twists', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'aside', 'spurting', 'blood', 'very', 'little', 'else', 'Then', 'are', 'left', 'survivors', 'running', 'building', 'building', 'trying', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'next', 'meal', 'numbers', 'dwindle', 'down', 'precious', 'few', 'Unfortunately', 'character', 'development', 'few', 'are', 'left', 'fight', 'out', 'are', 'absolutely', 'meaningless', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'interchangeable.Even', 'vampires', 'are', 'dull', 'have', 'nasty', 'rows', 'sharp', 'protruding', 'teeth', 'razor', 'sharp', 'fingernails', 'can', 'do', 'equal', 'amounts', 'damage', 'also', 'are', 'extremely', 'feral', 'only', 'one', 'possess', 'ability', 'speak', 'quite', 'frankly', 'tad', 'lethargic', 'most', 'time', 'Worse', 'seem', 'have', 'particular', 'REAL', 'game', 'plan', 'other', 'feed', 'fine', 'George', 'Romero', 'Zombie', 'movie', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'bit', 'more', 'fanged', 'undead', 'years', 'Even', 'Romero', 'films', 'offer', 'more', 'substance', 'turkey', 'only', '152', 'people', 'left', 'town', '30', 'days', 'feverish', 'fury', 'screeching', 'undead', 'are', 'doing', 'away', 'small', 'number', 'just', 'how', 'plan', 'get', 'home', 'have', 'done', 'away', 'everyone', 'arrived', 'ship', 'quickly', 'do', 'away', 'human', 'servant', 'who', 'did', 'bidding', 'one', 'who', 'paved', 'way', 'there', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'plan', 'must', 'ultimately', 'be', 'stay', 'descimated', 'village', 'starve', 'death', 'sport', 'very', 'quickly', 'done', 'one', 'films', 'up', 'question', 'question', 'watch', 'not', 'least', 'Okay', 'So', 'NOW', 'what', 'when', 'see', 'are', 'NO', 'answers', 'forthcoming', 'whole', 'simplistic', 'premise', 'fold', 'practically', 'have', 'lost', 'interest', 'one', 'point', 'newly', 'turned', 'vamp', 'human', 'can', 'smell', 'blood', 'case', 'so', 'many', 'vampires', 'lurking', 'keen', 'senses', 'smell', 'would', ""n't"", 'hiding', 'seem', 'fruitless', 'human', 'friends', 'get', 'building', 'vamps', 'become', 'worst', 'hide-and-go-seekers', 'ever', 'could', 'be', 'overlooked', 'were', 'least', 'one', 'plot', 'twist', 'vamps', 'remove', 'heads', 'victims', 'not', 'increase', 'number', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'delicious', 'SALEMS', 'LOT-like', 'premise', 'undead', 'friends', 'family', 'returning', 'do', 'harm', 'former', 'loved', 'ones', 'ending', 'absolute', 'cop', 'Was', ""n't"", 'there', 'million', 'other', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'return', 'Daylight', 'nasty', 'bone', 'crunching', 'machinary', 'ANYTHING', 'lazy', 'final', 'confrontation', 'filmmakers', 'settled', 'final', 'shot', 'clearly', 'designed', 'elicit', 'sympathy', 'revulsion', 'do', 'DAYS', 'might', 'be', 'fine', 'enough', 'rental', 'especially', 'younger', 'vampire', 'film', 'completists', 'simply', 'MUST', 'see', 'undead', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'discriminating', 'tastes', 'may', 'just', 'want', 'wait', 'one', 'pop', 'up', 'cable', 'one', 'day.It', 'can', 'wait']",N/A

1129015,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00111YM5Q,Tim Janson,"[1, 1]","When 30 Day of Night first came out in comic form back in 2002, I was only reading comics casually.  Still, I kept hearing more and more about the series.  The first issue had already escalated ridiculously in value and I didn't read it until it was published in collected format.  My initial thoughts upon finishing the book were that it would make a great movie.  The idea of vampires attacking a town near the Arctic Circle that is shrouded in darkness for a month was quite brilliant and terrifying as well.Barrow is that little, Alaskan town whose population is drastically reduced when the Sun finally sets for thirty days.  Most of the inhabitants head for warmer and brighter areas, leaving only the heartiest folk behind.  Using a lead lackey, the vampires cut the town off from the outside world...destroying cell phones, knocking out power and phone lines, and killing all the sled dogs.  The vampires descend upon the town like death itself, killing every person they can find.  Only a small group of survivors led by Sheriff Eben Oleson (Hartnett) and his wife Stella (George), manage to flee the slaughter but will they survive to see the Sun eventually rise?Great care was taken by director David Slade and his team to maintain the look and feel of the comic book.  Slade refers to the look as a ""metallic coldness"" which is a great description of Ben Templesmith's unusual sketchy art style.  The darkness is overwhelming for the residents of Barrow and their feeling of helplessness is quickly evident.  The vampires are not the alluring, seductive type out of an Ann Rice book...these monsters are pure predators, their mouths gape with rows of razor-sharp teeth.  They don't just bite their victims they gnaw and tear at them.  Humans are only food to these creatures.  Slade went so far as to develop a primeval, guttural language for the vampires, although they speak rarely.  Danny Huston is the head vampire and is simply chilling.  He's almost completely emotionless as he leads the vampires through the town.  Their look, language, and mannerisms almost suggest the vampires are not former humans, but a different race altogether.There is some fascinating camera work in 30 Days of Night.  As humans flee down the street we see the vamps following them from the rooftops, stalking them as if it were a game.  There are also some great aerial views that simply show the vampires attacking anything that moves indiscriminately, and it puts the wholesale slaughter into perspective.  Our survivors move from building to building, trying to stay hidden.  This suspense drives much of the middle of the film as they try and figure out their next move.30 Days of Night is not without its weaknesses.  The opening twenty minutes seemed rushed and almost unbelievable that someone could manage to steal and burn the all the town's cell phones.  I mean, I know I'd miss mine if it were gone for more than 15 minutes.  The same rather implausible ending from the comics was carried over to the film.  This is the one area where I had hoped for something a bit grander.  There's not much character development either.  We know that Eben and Stella a re estranged but that sub-plot is never explored in any detail.As a bit of trivia, Mark Boone Junior who plays Beau, also appeared in John Carpenter's Vampires, another outstanding vampire film.  30 Days isn't flawless, but it's certainly one of the best vampire films to come out in a long time.  Return to Barrow Anyone?Extras30 Days of night comes with a nice set of extra features.  The audio commentary features Hartnett, George, and Producer Rob Tapert.  The commentary is very lively and there are none of those uncomfortable periods of dead silence that you sometimes get in commentary tracks.  Hartnett not only read the graphic novel but was determined that the film be as faithful to the comic as possible, which is very refreshing.  One interesting note that George pointed out is that whenever you can see a person's breath in the film, it was all created by CGI.There is an 8 part documentary about the making of the film that can be watched all together or separately.  The entire set runs just under 60 minutes.Some of the more interesting parts include how the vampire actors were instructed how to walk, scream, and attack.  They all had to practice that move of leaping on their prey and tearing at their throats.  There's a look at the various prosthetics that were created and the make-up, including a look at the gruesome beheading of the little girl vampire.As explained in ""The Look"" segment, the dingy, dark-toned look of the characters wasn't achieved with make-up, but rather through digital enhancements.As an added bonus, the DVD feature the first episode of the hit Anime series Blood+",4,ONE OF

The time is winter, when the sun doesn't rise for thirty days, and any communication with the world outside is virtually impossible (the nearest town is 80 miles away).Except for the unique premise, however, ""30 Days of Night"" is mostly a reworking of old vampire/zombie films. There is more violence, and gores too, and it is much to the credit that the film's photography (by Jo Willems) captures the gloomy atmosphere of the isolated town where the sun doesn't shine. But when it comes to the storytelling skills, the film (directed by David Slade, ""Hard Candy"") is at best average. Things are predictable. Characters act exactly the way you think they will. What you have seen in other films you will see again.This is not to say that everything in ""30 Days of Night"" is clich&eacute;. The ""vampire"" leader (Danny Huston in special make-up), who looks like Max Schreck in black coat, actually speaks, well, not in English, though, unlike Lance Henriksen in ""Near Dark."" Josh Hartnett's hero acts like a real hero in the climax in an unusual way. The film tries to spice things up by offering some nice twists, which, however, are not developed enough.

The stranger had a key role in the events that are about to unfold and is on his way to Barrow, Alaska to watch the mayhem of his making.  Barrow is a small town on the Artic Circle that for thirty days a year never sees the sun.  Most of the town's citizens leave, but some remain behind.  The day before the beginning of the long night Barrow's sheriff, Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) finds himself busier than usual.  People's cell phones are found burned to a crisp, the town's helicopter is destroyed, and all of the sled dogs in the village are brutally killed.  While investigating the crimes Eben learns that his estranged wife, Stella (Melissa George), has missed her flight out of town and will be staying in Barrow through the long night.The Stranger causes a ruckus at the local diner and Eben believes he's the one responsible for all the strange and violent acts.  The Stranger laughs because he knows the vampires are coming and after taking out the local telecommunications center and power station they do.  The vampires move from house to house in a feeding frenzy.  Most of the townspeople are killed, but a few survivors make their way to the local diner to seek asylum.  The flaws in staying at the diner soon become apparent and some of the survivors decide to make their way to the hidden attic of a local homeowner who has left for the winter.  The group succeeds in traversing across the town and makes it to the attic.  The group attempts to weather the storm until the day when the sun rises again, but that day is a long time off and the vampires have other plans.30 DAYS OF NIGHT starts out with a premise that is indeed terrifying.  When I first learned about the project, I thought the concept was great and was excited to see the movie.  The film is shadowed in an almost dreamlike grey tint for most of the picture which augments the terror seen on the screen and sets the tone for most of the movie.  However, I was a bit disappointed by the vampires.  They pretty much seemed like the typical blood-sucking creatures of dark, but with a bit more intelligence than usual.  I was also disappointed that there wasn't more action in the film.  Since the movie is supposed to take place over thirty days, I assumed there would be lots of fighting.  Unfortunately, that's not the case.  There are a few action sequences, such as when a bulldozer plows into the local hotel, but not as many as there should have been; about half of the movie is setting around watching the characters sitting around getting cold and hungry and going crazy with cabin fever.  That's not to say that 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is a bad movie, because it isn't., for instance even though most of the characters are type characters I was still able to relate to the townspeople and the situation of being cooped up and not being able to do anything about it.  However, the movie just isn't as good as I expected it to be.

David Slade did an amazing job directing this piece, along with his previous film, Hard Candy.  This is one of the best vampire movies out there, folks. 30 Days of Night is to vampires as Dawn of the Dead is to zombies.  This movie is Blade 2 meets The Thing.The story is about a town in Alaska that is bombarded by vampires during a 30 day period of absolute darkness.  I have to give credit to Steve Niles for originating the story, because I think the premise is just genius.  Vampires are much more horrifying in this film than previous ones, where they're almost always corny or not intimadating.  The movie gives great scares.Ok, I have to say that the sound editing and production was Uh-Mazing.  The unique pulsating music was such a great addition to the film.  Along with this, the cinematography was comparable to 300 and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Fantastic!Actors did a great job for a horror film.  Josh Hartnett really took this seriously and did his best job since Sin City.  Ben Foster, as always, gave a great supporting role. And the villains were actually terrifying.  Melissa George did a decent job as did the rest of the cast.Vampires make an excellent return in this classic.  The story is thrilling and the action is astounding.

Rogers,"[12, 12]","Realizing that people have different opinions about what they read and watch, and that not all will agree with each other on what's good and what isn't, I was still somewhat surprised by how many viewers didn't find the horror movie, 30 Days of Night, to be as great as I did.  I'm usually pretty hard on horror flicks and don't expect a lot when I go to see one, but 30 Days of Night won me over in a way that left me stunned at the end of the movie and wanting to immediately see it again.Directed by David Slade, the story takes place in Barrow, Alaska (a real town), which is in the northern part of the state and once a year experiences thirty days of night.  Most of the town's people head south for the entire month, but there are enough humans left to entice a group of roving vampires to spend some quality vacation time there.  It all begins when a stranger arrives (played wonderfully by Ben Foster) during the last day of light and cuts the telephone lines and kills the sled dogs so that the remaining town's people will be snowed in and unable to escape the wrath of his master, Marlow.  The vampires then waste little time in attacking the town and killing every human being they can get their hands and teeth on.  It's the town's sheriff (played by Josh Hartnett) and his estranged wife (played by Melissa George) who manage to gather the surviving citizens and to find a place where they can hide from their hungry predators.  The problem, of course, is finding a way to stay alive until the sun once again appears after thirty long days of night.  That's going to be the challenge and few are going to make it.I thoroughly loved this movie and have watched it about twelve times, enjoying every single viewing.  Though I'm not a big fan of Josh Hartnett, I bought him as the sheriff and found his character to be totally believable.  I also felt that all of the other actors did an excellent job as well, especially Danny Huston, who played Marlow, the lead vampire.  He was utterly terrifying.  I thought the vampires were played true to life in that they were portrayed as savage, violent predators, killing everything within their grasp so that they can feed on the blood.  They were unbelievably fast and didn't hesitate in taking someone's head off, separating it from the body with one powerful sweep of their clawed hands.  The desolation of Barrow was captured perfectly by the set designer and director of photography as the camera took in from above what was happening below as dozens and dozens of people were massacred in different parts of the town by the marauding vampires.  This movie had me literally sitting on the edge of my seat and jumping in all the right places.  In many ways I thought this was the best horror flick of 2007, running just ahead of the film, 1408, with John Cusack.With regards to the DVD, I think I was close to being the first person to buy it when it eventually came out.  I was hoping the movie would be released in a Special Two-Disc Collector's set, but it only came out as a single.  Bah, humbug!  Still, there's a great featurette on the making of the film, containing interviews with the cast members and crew, plus a look at the real Barrow, Alaska.  The strange thing is that when the DVD came out, my roommate's daughter was getting ready to fly to Alaska with some friends, and I kept trying to get her to watch the movie before she left.  She told me NO! in a rather loud way, not wanting to have nightmares the whole time that she was there, freezing in below-zero temperatures.  I would've gone to Aruba, myself!  LOL.  Anyway, this film certainly has a special place in my DVD collection of horror films.  Highly recommended!!!",5,I'm one of the viewers who actually loved this movie!!!,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,3702,"['Realizing', 'people', 'have', 'different', 'opinions', 'what', 'read', 'watch', 'not', 'will', 'agree', 'other', 'what', 'good', 'what', ""n't"", 'was', 'still', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'viewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'horror', 'movie', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'did', ""'m"", 'usually', 'pretty', 'hard', 'horror', 'flicks', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'when', 'go', 'see', 'one', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'won', 'over', 'way', 'left', 'stunned', 'end', 'movie', 'wanting', 'immediately', 'see', 'again.Directed', 'David', 'Slade', 'story', 'place', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'real', 'town', 'northern', 'part', 'state', 'once', 'year', 'thirty', 'days', 'night', 'Most', 'town', 'people', 'head', 'south', 'entire', 'month', 'are', 'enough', 'humans', 'left', 'entice', 'group', 'roving', 'vampires', 'spend', 'quality', 'vacation', 'time', 'there', 'when', 'stranger', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'last', 'day', 'light', 'telephone', 'lines', 'sled', 'dogs', 'so', 'remaining', 'town', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'snowed', 'unable', 'escape', 'wrath', 'master', 'Marlow', 'vampires', 'then', 'waste', 'little', 'time', 'attacking', 'town', 'killing', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'teeth', 'town', 'sheriff', 'played', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'estranged', 'wife', 'played', 'Melissa', 'George', 'who', 'manage', 'gather', 'surviving', 'citizens', 'find', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'hide', 'hungry', 'predators', 'problem', 'course', 'finding', 'way', 'stay', 'alive', 'sun', 'once', 'again', 'thirty', 'long', 'days', 'night', 'going', 'be', 'challenge', 'few', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'it.I', 'thoroughly', 'loved', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'twelve', 'times', 'enjoying', 'single', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'bought', 'sheriff', 'found', 'character', 'be', 'totally', 'believable', 'also', 'felt', 'other', 'actors', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'who', 'played', 'Marlow', 'lead', 'vampire', 'was', 'utterly', 'terrifying', 'thought', 'vampires', 'were', 'played', 'true', 'life', 'were', 'portrayed', 'savage', 'violent', 'predators', 'killing', 'everything', 'grasp', 'can', 'feed', 'blood', 'were', 'unbelievably', 'fast', 'did', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'taking', 'someone', 'head', 'separating', 'body', 'one', 'powerful', 'sweep', 'clawed', 'hands', 'desolation', 'Barrow', 'was', 'captured', 'perfectly', 'set', 'designer', 'director', 'photography', 'camera', 'took', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'people', 'were', 'massacred', 'different', 'parts', 'town', 'marauding', 'vampires', 'movie', 'had', 'literally', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'jumping', 'right', 'places', 'many', 'ways', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'horror', 'flick', '2007', 'running', 'just', 'ahead', 'film', '1408', 'John', 'Cusack.With', 'regards', 'DVD', 'think', 'was', 'close', 'being', 'first', 'person', 'buy', 'when', 'eventually', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'Special', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'set', 'only', 'came', 'out', 'single', 'Bah', 'humbug', 'Still', 'great', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'containing', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'crew', 'look', 'real', 'Barrow', 'Alaska', 'strange', 'thing', 'when', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'roommate', 'daughter', 'was', 'getting', 'ready', 'fly', 'Alaska', 'friends', 'kept', 'trying', 'get', 'watch', 'movie', 'left', 'told', 'NO', 'rather', 'loud', 'way', 'not', 'wanting', 'have', 'nightmares', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'there', 'freezing', 'below-zero', 'temperatures', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'Aruba', 'LOL', 'Anyway', 'film', 'certainly', 'special', 'place', 'DVD', 'collection', 'horror', 'films', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

The town sheriff (Joss Hartnett)leads a group of survivors struggling to stay alive during the brutal onslaught of these creatures and the nasty weather. These aren't your garden-variety vampires that turn into bats but are feral, nasty creatures treating humans as nothing more than cattle. Actor Danny Hutton (""The Constant Gardener"") plays the brutal leader of these creatures while Ben Foster (""3:10 to Yuma"")is Renfield to his Dracula.Coming across as a mixture of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and ""Salem's Lot"", ""30 Days of Night"" than a variation on ""Dracula"" or one of the more romantic vampire flicks, the film looks amazing and although light on character development and logic will keep you on the edge of your seat. The action set pieces are wel set up and if the film doesn't quite measure up to what it could have been, it's still a solid thriller. This is the type of film that you put your brain into neutral for.The Blu-ray version of the film like the DVD includes a commentary track with actors Josh Hartnett, Melissa George and producer Rob Tapert, a featurette that's a solid look behind-the-scenes as well as ""30 Images of NIght"" where you can compare the film to pages from the graphic novel.

Not only was it glossier and better produced than I expected, but the acting was of a higher quality that you usually get in these kind of movies. The plot is based on a surprisingly effective premise; vampires arrive in a remote Alaskan town on the day that the sun disappears for a month. They send in a ""renfield"" to kill the town's dogs and cut off the power.It ramps up in tension from there. It plays more like a zombie siege movie than any other vamp movie I've seen, and the vamps themselves seem to like shedding blood more than drinking it. Be warned, the gore level is quite high, and nice people come to extremely bloody ends, even the kiddies. And the vamps aren't lounging around being sexy. These are real bloodsucking bastards, and all the better for it.Josh Hartnett is still a work in progress as an actor, but he's better here than I've seen him in anything else, probably because he's mostly reacting to dramatic events rather than trying to portray anyone too complex. Still, with this he's proved he can carry a movie, and I think we'll be seeing more of him in action roles soon.Like most horror movies, it suffers from several ""lets do something -really- stupid"" moments, but the whole thing is done with enough style and pace to get you through them without too much shouting at the screen. I particularly liked the overhead panning shots as the vamps took the town apart.In all, I enjoyed it. It was only later that I started to ask questions, like why the vamps wasted so much blood, and where they got their language skills, why they avoided the big utilities building with all the lights on, and where they went to after the final confrontation. But those are just quibbles.It's gone back on the shelf to be watched again, and that doesn't happen with many horror movies these days.",4,Bloody good fun,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,1939,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'hope', 'given', 'dearth', 'decent', 'vampire', 'movies', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'one', 'surprised', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'glossier', 'better', 'produced', 'expected', 'acting', 'was', 'higher', 'quality', 'usually', 'get', 'kind', 'movies', 'plot', 'based', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'premise', 'vampires', 'arrive', 'remote', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'day', 'sun', 'month', 'send', 'renfield', 'kill', 'town', 'dogs', 'cut', 'off', 'power.It', 'up', 'tension', 'there', 'more', 'zombie', 'siege', 'movie', 'other', 'vamp', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'vamps', 'seem', 'like', 'shedding', 'blood', 'more', 'drinking', 'Be', 'warned', 'gore', 'level', 'quite', 'high', 'nice', 'people', 'come', 'extremely', 'bloody', 'ends', 'even', 'kiddies', 'vamps', 'are', ""n't"", 'lounging', 'being', 'sexy', 'are', 'real', 'bloodsucking', 'bastards', 'better', 'it.Josh', 'Hartnett', 'still', 'work', 'progress', 'actor', 'better', 'here', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anything', 'else', 'probably', 'mostly', 'reacting', 'dramatic', 'events', 'rather', 'trying', 'portray', 'anyone', 'too', 'complex', 'Still', 'proved', 'can', 'carry', 'movie', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'more', 'action', 'roles', 'soon.Like', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'several', 'lets', 'do', 'something', '-really-', 'stupid', 'moments', 'whole', 'thing', 'done', 'enough', 'style', 'pace', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'shouting', 'screen', 'particularly', 'liked', 'overhead', 'panning', 'shots', 'vamps', 'took', 'town', 'apart.In', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'only', 'later', 'started', 'ask', 'questions', 'why', 'vamps', 'wasted', 'so', 'much', 'blood', 'where', 'got', 'language', 'skills', 'why', 'avoided', 'big', 'utilities', 'building', 'lights', 'where', 'went', 'final', 'confrontation', 'are', 'just', 'quibbles.It', 'gone', 'back', 'shelf', 'be', 'watched', 'again', ""n't"", 'happen', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'days']",N/A

Anyway, if you like vampire movies and gore go for it because it does a good job with both, but if you're looking for a movie which offers a better variety in scenery and plot skip this one.",3,3.5 out of 5,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,755,"['did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring', 'slow', 'slow', 'sense', 'just', 'never', 'seemed', 'go', 'anywhere', 'thought', 'gore', 'was', 'good', 'thought', 'make-up', 'effects', 'were', 'fair', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'plot', 'seemed', 'little', 'boring', '30', 'days', 'just', 'seemed', 'fly', 'know', 'needed', 'get', 'over', '1-2', 'hours', 'were', 'as', 'many', '7', 'days', 'skipped', 'time', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Vampire', 'movies', 'mean', 'kill', 'same', 'way', 'single', 'time', 'vicious', 'bite', 'neck', 'could', 'be', 'part', 'Anyway', 'like', 'vampire', 'movies', 'gore', 'go', 'good', 'job', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'better', 'variety', 'scenery', 'plot', 'skip', 'one']",N/A
