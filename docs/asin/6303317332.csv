The print used is in very good  condition  and  the  color just looks quite stunning!!The exciting thing of all  about this release is that  there is a fantastic restored scene  that has not been seen since it was first  released!!This scene happens  after Shirley  ends her ""AT THE CODFISH BALL"" number.  The scene  where  the old bearded guy  tells Shirley about  ""spitting"",  and the scene shows him spit and then make a funny  sound and then he has Shirley  try it and she does and  Shirley makes a spitting sound and then such  a cute noise,she does this  spitting  3 times and the sound 3 times and each time she does this, she looks so very adorable!!!Of course this scene is a  real  treat  for all of us who are big fans of little Shirley, and to see a NEW scene of her  is a big time treat!!As an extra on the DVD there is a newsreel  of Shirley  being anxious to pull the  rope  to a Will Rodgers momorial.  Notice how she seems to get kind of mad when she is first shown, she does this thing  with her arms and has such  a face at  that point and  the guys around her all look at her when she does this.This is a MUST HAVE  DVD if you are a fan of little Shirley!!",5,A RESTORED SCENE  HAS BEEN  PUT BACK IN!!!!!!!!,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,1258,"['one', 'Shirley', 'best', 'movies', 'color', 'version', 'fantastic', 'print', 'used', 'very', 'good', 'condition', 'color', 'just', 'quite', 'stunning', 'exciting', 'thing', 'release', 'fantastic', 'restored', 'scene', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'scene', 'Shirley', 'AT', 'THE', 'CODFISH', 'BALL', 'number', 'scene', 'where', 'old', 'bearded', 'guy', 'tells', 'Shirley', 'spitting', 'scene', 'spit', 'then', 'make', 'funny', 'sound', 'then', 'Shirley', 'try', 'Shirley', 'spitting', 'sound', 'then', 'cute', 'noise', 'spitting', '3', 'times', 'sound', '3', 'times', 'time', 'so', 'very', 'adorable', 'course', 'scene', 'real', 'treat', 'who', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'little', 'Shirley', 'see', 'NEW', 'scene', 'big', 'time', 'treat', 'extra', 'DVD', 'newsreel', 'Shirley', 'being', 'anxious', 'pull', 'rope', 'Will', 'Rodgers', 'momorial', 'Notice', 'how', 'get', 'kind', 'mad', 'when', 'first', 'shown', 'thing', 'arms', 'face', 'point', 'guys', 'look', 'when', 'this.This', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'DVD', 'are', 'fan', 'little', 'Shirley']",N/A
369090,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6303317332,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","This is the fifth Shirley Temple movie in this series, and one of my favorites. One of the best things about it is a very young Buddy Ebsen singing and dancing ""The Codfish Ball"" with Shirley. He's so tall and lanky, he's just right for that sort of dancing, and they are completely charming together.Shirley plays Star, an orphan who was shipwrecked near the lighthouse maintained by Captain January (Guy Kibbee). He has apparently taken care of her since she was an infant. Her mother's trunk was washed up on the shore after the wreck, and so we have a photo album which shows her to be an opera singer, and some of her mother's clothes.After the aforementioned Codfish Ball dance, we are introduced to the new truant officer, a crabby old thing played by Sara Haden. She insists Star must go to school, and makes it clear she would take Star away from the captain if she could. When she goes to visit the lighthouse, she tells the captain that he's not raising Star right. He brags about how smart she is, and the truant officer calls his bluff by declaring that her nephew is eight years old, and attempting to skip a grade. He will be examined, and Star can take the same test. (There are only four candles on her birthday cake, but that's probably dating from when Cap found her, so she's most likely five, or six at the most.) But she takes the test and passes, while the truant officer's nephew fails it.One of the best lines in the movie is Shirley's. Captain is reviewing what she knows about the Bible, and asks her to recount the story of the prodigal son. She tells it up to the part of the feast his father made to celebrate his coming home. Then January says that not everyone was happy the prodigal came home. He had a brother and there were some others. So who was sorry that the prodigal son came back? Star thinks about it a few seconds, then blurts out, ""The fatted calf!""Then Caps old friend the lighthouse inspector (Slim Summerville) gets a telegram telling him that an automated light is to be installed in the lighthouse, and he is to tell the lighthouse keepers that their services will not be needed after the end of the month, when the new light is installed. Seeing that Star is in danger of being sent to an orphanage if she and the captain are homeless, Slim writes to the address he found in the photo album which is assumed to be Star's relatives. There's a big traumatic scene when Star is taken away while the captain suffers a head injury from fighting the authorities who took her away. But it all comes out fine when her aunt and uncle buy a boat and install Captain January as captain, Slim as first mate, Buddy Ebsen as ""the crew"" and, to the Captain's chagrin, the widow who has been chasing him as the cook.This is a fun movie, with a little love story between Buddy Ebsen and the school teacher who gives Star her exam, and singing and costumes and the obligatory dream scene. In this one, Cap is a baby and Star is his nurse. Of course, she has to get up a flight of stairs to reach his high chair, and tries to feed him with a huge serving spoon. But when she lays a diaper down on the floor and shakes baby powder into it, the scene ends.",4,Possibly Shirley Temple's Best Movie,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3185,"['fifth', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movie', 'series', 'one', 'favorites', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'very', 'young', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Codfish', 'Ball', 'Shirley', 'so', 'tall', 'lanky', 'just', 'right', 'sort', 'dancing', 'are', 'completely', 'charming', 'together.Shirley', 'plays', 'Star', 'orphan', 'who', 'was', 'shipwrecked', 'lighthouse', 'maintained', 'Captain', 'January', 'Guy', 'Kibbee', 'apparently', 'taken', 'care', 'was', 'infant', 'mother', 'trunk', 'was', 'washed', 'up', 'shore', 'wreck', 'so', 'have', 'photo', 'album', 'be', 'opera', 'singer', 'mother', 'clothes.After', 'aforementioned', 'Codfish', 'Ball', 'dance', 'are', 'introduced', 'new', 'truant', 'officer', 'crabby', 'old', 'thing', 'played', 'Sara', 'Haden', 'Star', 'must', 'go', 'school', 'clear', 'would', 'take', 'Star', 'away', 'captain', 'could', 'When', 'visit', 'lighthouse', 'captain', 'not', 'raising', 'Star', 'right', 'how', 'smart', 'truant', 'officer', 'bluff', 'declaring', 'nephew', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'attempting', 'skip', 'grade', 'will', 'be', 'examined', 'Star', 'can', 'take', 'same', 'test', 'are', 'only', 'four', 'candles', 'birthday', 'cake', 'probably', 'dating', 'when', 'Cap', 'found', 'most', 'likely', 'five', 'six', 'most', 'test', 'passes', 'truant', 'officer', 'nephew', 'it.One', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'Shirley', 'Captain', 'reviewing', 'what', 'Bible', 'recount', 'story', 'prodigal', 'son', 'up', 'part', 'feast', 'father', 'made', 'celebrate', 'coming', 'home', 'Then', 'January', 'not', 'everyone', 'was', 'happy', 'prodigal', 'came', 'home', 'had', 'brother', 'were', 'others', 'who', 'was', 'sorry', 'prodigal', 'son', 'came', 'back', 'Star', 'few', 'seconds', 'then', 'out', 'fatted', 'calf', 'Then', 'Caps', 'old', 'friend', 'lighthouse', 'inspector', 'Slim', 'Summerville', 'telegram', 'telling', 'automated', 'light', 'be', 'installed', 'lighthouse', 'tell', 'lighthouse', 'keepers', 'services', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'needed', 'end', 'month', 'when', 'new', 'light', 'installed', 'Seeing', 'Star', 'danger', 'being', 'sent', 'orphanage', 'captain', 'are', 'homeless', 'Slim', 'address', 'found', 'photo', 'album', 'assumed', 'be', 'Star', 'relatives', 'big', 'traumatic', 'scene', 'when', 'Star', 'taken', 'away', 'captain', 'head', 'injury', 'fighting', 'authorities', 'who', 'took', 'away', 'out', 'fine', 'when', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'buy', 'boat', 'install', 'Captain', 'January', 'captain', 'Slim', 'first', 'mate', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'crew', 'Captain', 'chagrin', 'widow', 'who', 'been', 'chasing', 'cook.This', 'fun', 'movie', 'little', 'love', 'story', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'Star', 'exam', 'singing', 'costumes', 'obligatory', 'dream', 'scene', 'one', 'Cap', 'baby', 'Star', 'nurse', 'course', 'get', 'up', 'flight', 'stairs', 'reach', 'high', 'chair', 'tries', 'feed', 'huge', 'serving', 'spoon', 'when', 'diaper', 'down', 'floor', 'shakes', 'baby', 'powder', 'scene']",N/A
