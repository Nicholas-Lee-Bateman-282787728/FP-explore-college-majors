1450860,A1W9JOFE6F89FB,B0059XTU7W,Amber MacDonald,"[0, 0]","I am happy that I was selected to review this film, as it might have passed me by had I not. Cathy Rush answered the call for a coaching job of an all but non-existant women's basketball program at Sister Immaculata school. Her husband is a professional referee, but does nothing to support her initially. On her own, at first, she sets off on a crusade of sorts that begins with rallying the unlikely team. She faces nothing but one obstacle after the next, she overcomes each of them with determination and resolve, setting an example of refusing to fail that ultimately rubs off on the team.The acting in this movie was top-notch, several characters were very relatable to people I have met in my life. The situation, again, is based on a true story, so it is obviously relatable, but it reminds me of a story of a local high school who's girl's team was known for their bad record every year. Just like in the movie and unlikely coach brought the team from their losing spell through pure motivation, not just direction. They went from winning only one game the year before to winning most of the next year's games. This, perhaps is the biggest achevment made by this film, people are capable of doing extraordinary things, but first they have to believe in themselves and sometimes, this takes a special person. Cathy Rush was that person for Immaculata.The scenes are heavily focused on dialogue, particularly motivational dialogue that will pluck your heartstrings. This is where the excellent script is allowed to shine. At no point does the dialogue seem recycled in anyway. Each character has a different personality and reacts as such to different situations. Everything seems so real and believable.This movie is great I would recommend it to anyone. It is appropriate for all ages and audiences. Pick it up and check it out. It is a perfect example of how any obstacle can be overcome, no matter how unlikely it may seem",5,Such A Great Movie,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,1933,"['am', 'happy', 'was', 'selected', 'review', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'passed', 'had', 'not', 'Cathy', 'Rush', 'answered', 'call', 'coaching', 'job', 'non-existant', 'women', 'basketball', 'program', 'Sister', 'Immaculata', 'school', 'husband', 'professional', 'referee', 'nothing', 'support', 'initially', 'own', 'first', 'off', 'crusade', 'sorts', 'rallying', 'unlikely', 'team', 'nothing', 'one', 'obstacle', 'next', 'determination', 'resolve', 'setting', 'example', 'refusing', 'fail', 'ultimately', 'off', 'team.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'top-notch', 'several', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'relatable', 'people', 'have', 'met', 'life', 'situation', 'again', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'obviously', 'relatable', 'story', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'girl', 'team', 'was', 'known', 'bad', 'record', 'year', 'Just', 'movie', 'unlikely', 'coach', 'brought', 'team', 'losing', 'spell', 'pure', 'motivation', 'not', 'just', 'direction', 'went', 'winning', 'only', 'one', 'game', 'year', 'winning', 'most', 'next', 'year', 'games', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'achevment', 'made', 'film', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'extraordinary', 'things', 'first', 'have', 'believe', 'sometimes', 'special', 'person', 'Cathy', 'Rush', 'was', 'person', 'Immaculata.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'heavily', 'focused', 'dialogue', 'particularly', 'motivational', 'dialogue', 'will', 'pluck', 'heartstrings', 'where', 'excellent', 'script', 'allowed', 'shine', 'point', 'dialogue', 'seem', 'recycled', 'anyway', 'character', 'different', 'personality', 'reacts', 'such', 'different', 'situations', 'Everything', 'so', 'real', 'believable.This', 'movie', 'great', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'audiences', 'Pick', 'up', 'check', 'out', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'obstacle', 'can', 'be', 'overcome', 'matter', 'how', 'unlikely', 'may', 'seem']",The Mighty Macs

1450869,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0059XTU7W,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","The journey from production to the big screen for ""The Mighty Macs"" was a tortuous one.  My father worked for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia who offered assistance to the film while they were making it a few years ago.  The film had a hard time getting a distributor.  It finally came out last Fall in the wake of ""Moneyball"" another film about a sports team with little financial resources who rise to the top.  ""Moneyball"" had a bankable star in Brad Pitt as a selling point.  ""The Mighty Macs"" pretty much disappeared in limited release.  It's a shame because it's an excellent film.  Ostensibly the film chronicles the first year of a run of three consecutive NCAA titles for the tiny Immaculata College's women's basketball team in the early Seventies.  Really the film is about what it means to be a winner.  What the film stresses is that winning is a group effort that can't be done alone.  Yes, Coach Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) can philosophize the intracacies of playing together but that is reciprocated by her players who teach Rush a few things about the facts of life.  The coach and players are assisted in their journey by the assistant coach, Sister Sunday(Marley Shelton), who may be young but not unwise to the potholes in life.  They are also inspired by the humility and self-sacrifice of the Immaculate Heart Sisters led by their Mother Superior played by Ellen Burstyn who administer the beseiged college.  I'm sure there are some embellishments but most of the events portrayed in the film are true.  If you're looking for exciting game footage this is the film for you.  If you're looking for a testament to human faith you found it.  Judging from the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the film from those who've seen ""The Mighty Macs"" this is the one that got away.",5,Incredible True Sports Story,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,1793,"['journey', 'production', 'big', 'screen', 'Mighty', 'Macs', 'was', 'tortuous', 'one', 'father', 'worked', 'Archdiocese', 'Philadelphia', 'who', 'offered', 'assistance', 'film', 'were', 'making', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'distributor', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'last', 'Fall', 'wake', 'Moneyball', 'film', 'sports', 'team', 'little', 'financial', 'resources', 'who', 'rise', 'top', 'Moneyball', 'had', 'bankable', 'star', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'selling', 'point', 'Mighty', 'Macs', 'pretty', 'much', 'disappeared', 'limited', 'release', 'shame', 'excellent', 'film', 'Ostensibly', 'film', 'first', 'year', 'run', 'three', 'consecutive', 'NCAA', 'titles', 'tiny', 'Immaculata', 'College', 'women', 'basketball', 'team', 'early', 'Seventies', 'Really', 'film', 'what', 'be', 'winner', 'What', 'film', 'stresses', 'winning', 'group', 'effort', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'alone', 'Yes', 'Coach', 'Cathy', 'Rush', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'can', 'philosophize', 'intracacies', 'playing', 'together', 'reciprocated', 'players', 'who', 'teach', 'Rush', 'few', 'things', 'facts', 'life', 'coach', 'players', 'are', 'assisted', 'journey', 'assistant', 'coach', 'Sister', 'Sunday', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'young', 'not', 'unwise', 'potholes', 'life', 'are', 'also', 'inspired', 'humility', 'self-sacrifice', 'Immaculate', 'Heart', 'Sisters', 'led', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'administer', 'beseiged', 'college', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'embellishments', 'most', 'events', 'portrayed', 'film', 'are', 'true', ""'re"", 'looking', 'exciting', 'game', 'footage', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'testament', 'human', 'faith', 'found', 'Judging', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reaction', 'film', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mighty', 'Macs', 'one', 'got', 'away']",The Mighty Macs

Others I liked were Hoosiers and Remember the Titans.One month ago, I picked up The Mighty Macs as a previously viewed DVD.  The Mighty Macs was one film I really wanted to see, since Tim Chambers had been interviewed on Catholic Radio and EWTN's Life on the Rock devoted a whole show to The Mighty Macs.  I'm also familiar with Immaculata College (now Immaculata University) because I often visit Philadelphia.  One high school mentioned in the film (Villa Maria) is still open and is not far away in Malvern.  I did not know that Immaculata was an all-girls school until recently.  I do know a good priest who has served in recent years as the Chaplain to the Campus Ministry.However,  I didn't get to see The Mighty Macs in the theatre (part of it was the limited release - it only played at the dollar cinema here for a week), so I was glad I got to see it on DVD. Like the other reviewers, I found the extras, particularly the ESPN documentary, to be interesting, as well as the makings of the film.The Mighty Macs was made in 2009, and it took a long time for Tim Chambers to find a distributor.  I'm glad Tim Chambers ""stuck to his guns"" and refused to ""water down"" this story. Mr. Chambers started researching this story in 2004.  It was a great film - I've watched it twice.  I liked the story, and as one reviewer mentioned, this was before Title IX.The Mighty Macs was a very positive film, not only about basketball but about the players.  I liked how the ladies were shown as ""real"" people. None of them seemed ""cliquish"", and it was refreshing to see a film with actresses who were not ""bleached blondes"", 5'-10"" and a size 4. All were bright students, and each character had her struggles.  It was great to see ""the girls next door"" on film.  I also enjoyed the scene where the girls pitched in and lent one girl a dress and heels for their group photo.Another thing too that came in the DVD extras was that each actress during her audition was ""graded"" on her ability to play basketball. During shooting, the girls played quite a bit of basketball. One actress in the film even played basketball at a college in Florida.  Had a mainstream Hollywood studio made this film, The Mighty Macs would have been less believable - Tim Chambers did a great job.",5,Nice to see The Girls Next Door,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,2345,"['man', 'also', 'sports', 'films', 'one', 'favorites', 'Are', 'Marshall', 'Others', 'liked', 'were', 'Hoosiers', 'Remember', 'Titans.One', 'month', 'ago', 'picked', 'up', 'Mighty', 'Macs', 'previously', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'Mighty', 'Macs', 'was', 'one', 'film', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'Tim', 'Chambers', 'had', 'been', 'interviewed', 'Catholic', 'Radio', 'EWTN', 'Life', 'Rock', 'devoted', 'whole', 'show', 'Mighty', 'Macs', ""'m"", 'also', 'familiar', 'Immaculata', 'College', 'now', 'Immaculata', 'University', 'often', 'visit', 'Philadelphia', 'One', 'high', 'school', 'mentioned', 'film', 'Villa', 'Maria', 'still', 'open', 'not', 'far', 'away', 'Malvern', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Immaculata', 'was', 'all-girls', 'school', 'recently', 'do', 'know', 'good', 'priest', 'who', 'served', 'recent', 'years', 'Chaplain', 'Campus', 'Ministry.However', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Mighty', 'Macs', 'theatre', 'part', 'was', 'limited', 'release', 'only', 'played', 'dollar', 'cinema', 'here', 'week', 'so', 'was', 'glad', 'got', 'see', 'DVD', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'extras', 'particularly', 'ESPN', 'documentary', 'be', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'makings', 'film.The', 'Mighty', 'Macs', 'was', 'made', '2009', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'Tim', 'Chambers', 'find', 'distributor', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Tim', 'Chambers', 'stuck', 'guns', 'refused', 'water', 'down', 'story', 'Mr', 'Chambers', 'started', 'researching', 'story', '2004', 'was', 'great', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'liked', 'story', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'was', 'Title', 'IX.The', 'Mighty', 'Macs', 'was', 'very', 'positive', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'basketball', 'players', 'liked', 'how', 'ladies', 'were', 'shown', 'real', 'people', 'None', 'seemed', 'cliquish', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'film', 'actresses', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'bleached', 'blondes', ""5'-10"", 'size', '4', 'were', 'bright', 'students', 'character', 'had', 'struggles', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'girls', 'door', 'film', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'where', 'girls', 'pitched', 'lent', 'one', 'girl', 'dress', 'heels', 'group', 'thing', 'too', 'came', 'DVD', 'extras', 'was', 'actress', 'audition', 'was', 'graded', 'ability', 'play', 'basketball', 'shooting', 'girls', 'played', 'quite', 'bit', 'basketball', 'One', 'actress', 'film', 'even', 'played', 'basketball', 'college', 'Florida', 'Had', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'made', 'film', 'Mighty', 'Macs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'believable', 'Tim', 'Chambers', 'did', 'great', 'job']",The Mighty Macs

1450874,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B0059XTU7W,Doug Erlandson,"[0, 0]","I went to see this movie when it came out in the theaters for two reasons. First, I remember reading about the Immaculata women's basketball championships in the early to mid-1970s before Title IX ensured that women's basketball would become part of the big-time college sports scene. (At the time I was teaching at the University of Nebraska and men's basketball was the only game in town.) Second, and more importantly, my wife had gone to Immaculata 1968-1970 and wanted to see the movie. Plus, having married a girl from the Philadelphia area, I had been out there on a number of occasions and figured some of the scenes might be familiar.What I saw was a movie that was far better than anything I had expected. This true story of a coach with little experience, girls with limited natural ability but a true desire to win, and facilities that even back then, some forty years ago, were definitely subpar, is in every way uplifting and inspirational. It was during these early years of the five-on-five full court game that girls showed that they could play in a way that was as competitive and exciting as their male counterparts. Schools like Immaculata (and some of the other small colleges that were at the forefront of the women's game back then) have been eclipsed by the top-rate programs at many universities today, but they deserve recognition for all that they did for the game.

Please, uh, don't lose it.""Maybe you'll raise an eyebrow or nudge an elbow when you hear talk of Immaculata College, once an all-women Catholic school, being compared to John Wooden's UCLA dynasty, but, no, it's not balderdash, it's not whistling in the dark. THE MIGHTY MACS tells the remarkable true story of Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) who, as a woman in her early twenties and with no coaching experience, in 1972 became the head coach of Immaculata's struggling women's basketball team, and never mind that she was the only one to have applied for the position. And in Immaculata, nestled just a bit outside of Philadelphia, is where Cathy Rush made her mark. By the time she was done, Immaculata College was regarded as the birthplace of modern women's basketball. Moments after I saw this flick, I was on the Google, wanting to know more. I was that hooked.Recognize that the 1970s presented an era in which women were still expected to be stay-at-home wives while the menfolk brought home the bacon, meaning that Cathy Rush was a pioneer in more ways than one. The state of affairs at Immaculata upon her arrival was straight up horrible. Immaculata's basketball program touted no scholarships, no budget, had no uniforms. The gym had burned down some time ago. THE MIGHTY MACS sets up a perfect underdog scenario. And since it's rated G, this really is for the entire family to savor, especially if you have young girls in the household. It's well-executed drama and hits all the right notes. In terms of heart and a knack for rapidly generating that rooting interest, THE MIGHTY MACS is right up there with HOOSIERS. Nostalgia drips from this relevant time capsule.Carla Gugino can never be on the screen enough. She's so dang beautiful it tends to overshadow the fact that she can act. She's so strong here as Cathy Rush. She captures the coach's relentless personality and her gumption and her flair. I really like those scenes in which she implements her training techniques and attempts to impart life lessons on her doubting players. The film also touches on Cathy's sometimes rocky personal life. David Boreanaz's part as NBA ref and Cathy's hubbie, Ed Rush, is more a supporting one, but Boreanaz is good and ably conveys the mindset of the macho male of that era. Still, you sense that his resistance to Cathy's taking on a job will eventually wilt. Marley Shelton, whom I initially assumed was Amy Acker (from ANGEL), is captivating as the gamine but feisty coach's assistant Sister Sunday. And, as ever, Ellen Burstyn's presence can't help but class up a production even more. Burstyn plays the severe, fretful Mother Superior, at her wits' end over Immaculata's terrible financial plight. She has no idea salvation would come from a marginalized women's sport.Women's basketball showcases skill and precise execution over rampant athleticism. The oncourt sequences emphasize the philosophy of teamwork, of timely passing and scrappy defense. I found myself enjoying the basketball scenes as much as the acting moments. The girls of the Mighty Macs look convincing on the court, never mind that their uniform comprises an ungainly tunic and a belt sash. The camera makes sure to track the ball from the moment it leaves the girls' fingertips to when it swishes thru the net. These girls know how to play.***Possible SPOILERS in the paragraph***In a tumultuous time in which women everywhere were breaking barriers, and specifically in 1972, Cathy Rush came to coach at Immaculata College. And in 1972, against all odds, the Mighty Macs won the inaugural national college women's basketball tournament. And won it again the following year, in 1973. And again in 1974. Imagine what their opponents must've felt during that era, each time they stepped on the hardwood. Not only did they have to play the Macs but they also had to face a horde of nuns actively praying for an Immaculata victory. Heck, maybe Cathy Rush's overwhelming record of 149 wins set against only 15 losses may be attributed to divine intervention more so than uncanny coaching prowess.The DVD's bonus stuff is pretty absorbing. There are 3 Deleted Scenes, including a cheer from the Immaculata cheerleading squad, composed of enthusiastic elderly nuns (totaling 00:04:42 minutes). The two featurettes - ""The Making Of THE MIGHTY MACS"" (00:23:48 minutes) and ""THE MIGHTY MACS ESPN Segment"" (00:06:22 minutes) - provide a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the Immaculata women's basketball dynasty. For example, did you know that the nuns and other Mighty Macs supporters would beat on buckets with a wooden dowel to cheer their team on? And, as an added treat, keep an eye out for cameos from the real Cathy Rush (as a bank teller) and her husband Ed Rush (as an elderly passerby on the sidewalk who donates to the school). There's also a church scene early on in which a row of nuns passes along Cathy's note to a possible recruit. These nuns are none other than the original members of the 1972 Mighty Macs squad.",5,"""The answer lies somewhere between Heaven and the hardwood.""",1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,5108,"['Mother',

I watched it on Netflix the other night and was so sad that this movie didn't get more press and exposure. This movie was great. First of all, I have to say that Carla Gugino has to be the most under-recognized and under appreciated actress of her generation. It's not easy to pull off the role of a no nonsense coach without some serious training. It's an attitude, a way of walking, and talking. It's about talking with precision and authority. I am constantly amazed at her ability to tackle one role to the next, with no similarities whatsoever, and completely owning every role. I felt like I was watching one of my old coaches from high school who had 20 plus years of experience getting something out of kids. What a talented woman. This movie is about creating something from nothing, and singularly focusing on achieving something when no one thought it could be possible. There's no foul language, obscenities, anything but heartfelt joy at watching a group of players come together to achieve something extraordinary. And sometimes that in itself is refreshing, since we are surrounded by extreme violence and graphic sexuality at every turn. This movie is for people of all ages, providing a little hope in a world where there doesn't seem to be much. A would call this an hour and a half well spent.",5,"Great, uplifting movie.

1450895,ABC8FXLD7W528,B0059XTU7W,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[10, 10]","Take a trip back to 1971 when women's college basketball was just beginning. Not many women tried out for the sport, and it was far from being taken seriously.  The Immaculata, a small Catholic college, has just hired a new basketball coach - Cathy Rush - to coach the Macs. Cathy's goal is to turn the inexperienced women's team with a losing streak into a #1 team. However, there isn't much hope. The college gymnasium recently burned to the ground. Most of the players lack experience. Cathy's unorthodox ideas aren't exactly embraced by the Nuns at the college, and financial problems abound threatening to close Immaculata. Old uniforms and a lack of funds to purchase shoes and travel to games add to the troubles. Can Cathy, along with her assistant coach, a Nun named Sister Sunday, turn things around for the flailing team?There are many great moments in this movie. One of the girls comes from a poverty-stricken home. When pictures are taken, she wears her only outfit - a pair of ratty overalls and old boots. The result is an act of compassion that, for me, was a tearjerker moment.  Another great moment is when Cathy has the chance to confront her former basketball coach and does so with grace toward someone who had caused her much pain.There are some humorous moments throughout this movie as well. Viewers will want to be sure to watch The Mighty Macs ESPN segment at the end of the movie, which shows coverage from the real games and highlights some of the real-life players,  as well as, the real Cathy Rush.I enjoyed this movie. It's a heartwarming and touching story for the entire family about an underdog team and the value of teamwork.

1450896,A8N3FYDA2VUYY,B0059XTU7W,"Pirate2240 ""Kat""","[2, 2]","It's 1971. Cathy Rush is a woman ahead of her time ... and she's about to embark on an adventure for the ages. A new era is dawning in the country and in collegiate athletics, where a national champion will be crowned for the first time in women's basketball.In the lead up to this historical season, major universities are preparing their game plans to win that first title. Meanwhile a tiny all-women's Catholic college in Philadelphia has a more modest goal: find a coach before the season begins. Providentially, Cathy Rush is about to find Immaculata College.Recently married, Cathy is dealing with the aftermath of a truncated playing career. While cultural norms would have her staying at home, she's willing to do the hard work necessary to help her new team reach their goals--or perhaps she's just trying to achieve her unfulfilled dreams through them.From the beginning, her challenges are as imposing as the big-school teams Immaculata will face on the court. Cathy learns there is no gymnasium on campus, she receives little support from the school's Mother Superior, and the school is in dire financial straits. To top it off, she may not even have enough players to field a team!While it appears the Macs don't have a prayer, all hope is not lost. With the help of Sister Sunday--a spunky assistant coach--and the support of a booster club of elderly nuns, Coach Rush creates a new game plan that just might bring the team--and the school--together.Will this pioneer buck cultural norms and spur her rag-tag team to unexpected heights? Or will her hard-driving ways create a wedge between the coach and everyone around her? One thing's for certain: there's never been anyone like Cathy Rush at Immaculata!THE MIGHTY MACS is based on the incredible true story of the 1971-72 Immaculata College team that started in obscurity but became the original Cinderella story in women's basketball. This team of pioneers went from barely making that inaugural tournament to the first dynasty in their game. And Cathy Rush, the woman that was ahead of her time, became immortalized when she was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.THE MIGHTY MACS stars Carla Gugino as Cathy Rush; David Boreanaz as her husband, NBA referee Ed Rush; Marley Shelton as Sister Sunday; and Academy Award and Tony Award winner Ellen Burstyn as Mother St. John. The film was written, directed, and produced by Tim Chambers. The film's executive producers are Pat Croce, the former president of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, and Vince Curran, a successful businessman and former basketball star at Penn. Curran and Chambers are founders and partners of Quaker Media.As a concerned parent, we are always looking for great movies that have a truth about them, a moral message to be gained from simply just heading to the movies for a night of family fun and entertainment, and it's such an honor to share this one with my readers. For those of you that are huge fans of family-feel good movies like Fireproof, Courageous or Seven Days To Utopia, then I know you will want to see this one. This movie is now playing in select theaters near you. I received this opportunity to preview this before it was released compliments of Propeller, Quaker Media and Affirm Films, and can't wait for you all to see it.

1450908,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B0059XTU7W,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This movie is like the female version of &#34;Hoosiers,&#34; even opening with a similar retro montage where a basketball coach (Carla Gugino) drives to her new school through the countryside, this time a college in Pennsylvania rather than a high school in Indiana. Like &#34;Hoosiers,&#34; it's based on the true story of an unlikely basketball championship, this time a 1970s basketball team at a small Catholic women's college in Pennsylvania. It even features the same underlying theme of religion (this time Catholicism rather than Protestantism) as it relates to basketball as a metaphor for life. Knowing this much about the film and having seen the trailer, I was not really expecting much from it, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it highly entertaining. While it may not match &#34;Hoosiers&#34; in the emotional depth of its performances, as it lacks the touching triangle of broken lives (Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey, and Dennis Hopper) of that 1986 gem, &#34;The Mighty Macs&#34; is refreshing in bringing a lighter touch to this genre. Above all, it works because it treats basketball as a game, not as a pseudo-religious substitute for the divine. Therefore it's a more lighthearted alternative to &#34;Hoosiers&#34; and &#34;Hoop Dreams,&#34; but it likewise avoids the cliched melodrama and buffoonish comedy of sports films like Disney's &#34;Glory Road.&#34; Carla Gugino makes it work, giving an understated and insistently sincere performance as a Baptist basketball coach hired to coach girls at a small Catholic college in danger of bankruptcy. There are cliched themes, of course, like the independent woman trying to make it in the 1970s and the misfit players learning to work together as a team. But it works because of the good will of the performers to tell this story. Rather than being a schlock production by Disney or some other major studio, this one was produced independently, and it shows in the genuineness of human interactions in the film between the players and among the adults featured. If this inspirational film is ultimately a tad lightweight, perhaps that's because it is reminding us that sports like basketball are ultimately just games, not substitutes or metaphors for real relationships and careers as many people in our society have come to believe. In that sense, I loved this movie, and I think others -- both male and female -- will enjoy it as well if they are open to the idea that sports films based on true stories do not need to imbue their stories with life-or-death implications. This film reminds us that the games we learned in childhood, no matter how much we have come to idolize them as moneymakers, are ultimately for enjoyment rather than profit. Sometimes a game is just a game.",5,Sweet and uplifting true basketball story,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,2758,"['movie', 'female', 'version', '34', 'Hoosiers', '34', 'even', 'opening', 'similar', 'retro', 'montage', 'where', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'new', 'school', 'countryside', 'time', 'college', 'Pennsylvania', 'rather', 'high', 'school', 'Indiana', '34', 'Hoosiers', '34', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'unlikely', 'basketball', 'championship', 'time', '1970s', 'basketball', 'team', 'small', 'Catholic', 'women', 'college', 'Pennsylvania', 'even', 'same', 'underlying', 'theme', 'religion', 'time', 'Catholicism', 'rather', 'Protestantism', 'basketball', 'metaphor', 'life', 'Knowing', 'much', 'film', 'having', 'seen', 'trailer', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'expecting', 'much', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'may', 'not', 'match', '34', 'Hoosiers', '34', 'emotional', 'depth', 'performances', 'touching', 'triangle', 'broken', 'lives', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', '1986', 'gem', '34', 'Mighty', 'Macs', '34', 'refreshing', 'bringing', 'lighter', 'touch', 'genre', 'basketball', 'game', 'not', 'pseudo-religious', 'substitute', 'divine', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'alternative', '34', 'Hoosiers', '34', '34', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', '34', 'likewise', 'cliched', 'melodrama', 'buffoonish', 'comedy', 'sports', 'films', 'Disney', '34', 'Glory', 'Road.', '34', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'work', 'giving', 'understated', 'insistently', 'sincere', 'performance', 'Baptist', 'basketball', 'coach', 'hired', 'coach', 'girls', 'small', 'Catholic', 'college', 'danger', 'bankruptcy', 'are', 'cliched', 'themes', 'course', 'independent', 'woman', 'trying', 'make', '1970s', 'misfit', 'players', 'learning', 'work', 'together', 'team', 'good', 'will', 'performers', 'tell', 'story', 'Rather', 'being', 'schlock', 'production', 'Disney', 'other', 'major', 'studio', 'one', 'was', 'produced', 'independently', 'genuineness', 'human', 'interactions', 'film', 'players', 'adults', 'featured', 'inspirational', 'film', 'ultimately', 'tad', 'lightweight', 'perhaps', 'reminding', 'sports', 'basketball', 'are', 'ultimately', 'just', 'games', 'not', 'metaphors', 'real', 'relationships', 'careers', 'many', 'people', 'society', 'have', 'come', 'believe', 'sense', 'loved', 'movie', 'think', 'others', 'male', 'female', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'open', 'idea', 'sports', 'films', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'imbue', 'stories', 'life-or-death', 'implications', 'film', 'games', 'learned', 'childhood', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'come', 'idolize', 'moneymakers', 'are', 'ultimately', 'enjoyment', 'rather', 'profit', 'Sometimes', 'game', 'just', 'game']",The Mighty Macs
1450909,A10UPYF30K74H0,B0059XTU7W,"Trinity Rose ""book lover""","[2, 2]","The Mighty Macs is a true inspiring story that I really enjoyed and watched several times. This story happened in 1971 to a very small Catholic college who wins the basketball national championship against some major universities.Cathy Rush is recently married and decides she doesn't want to be a stay at home wife, but wants to see if she has it in her to become a coach.She faces many challenges besides going against huge universities, she learns the college has no gymnasium on campus, it burned down a few months ago, she doesn't receive any support from the Mother Superior and the school is in really bad financial path. Another thing she doesn't know if she will have enough players for a team.After all of the problems Cathy finds an assistant in a nun who helps her in many ways and gives her hope and inspires her.You need to watch this to see what happens, if the team wins, if the school crumbles, if her husband hates what she is doing.I really recommend this great DVD for family night. It is full of fun, inspiring, never give up scenes. Besides the wonderful movie on the DVD you will see deleted scenes, The making of the movie The Mighty Macs and a real segment from the ESPN network on real Mighty Macs. Also some of the nuns in the DVD were the real players from the first Mighty Macs team.

1450912,AB1CKA6B849SP,B0059XTU7W,zeus,"[2, 2]","One of the best movies of the year! Great inspirational movie. True story and well done, down to the scores of the games and how the teams got there.The movie tells the true story of Cathy Rush and the Immaculata girls basketball team. Make sure you check her incredible story online and then watch the movie. The best scenario is written by life. No need to imagine and make things up. She had tremendous courage for that time (1972) and she is pushing everybody to their limits. If she was using the same methods today with all the idiotic parents who want to be their kid's friend instead of parenting, and who want to give trophies to everybody just for participation, she should have been out of a job and probably sued by some low life lawyer.There are several extras on the DVD that are very interesting. The ESPN production is fabulous and shows the real team in 1972. The interviews with the cast are also great. But the real interesting things on the DVD are the three deleted scenes. I definitely think that they should have included at least two of the scenes in the movie to remind some people (and to show the younger generation) how women were treated just 40 years ago in the so called civilized world. Maybe the producers cut the scenes because didn't want to hurt people feelings. But maybe they didn't put these scenes in because didn't want to distract from the real subject which is the unbelievable courage and tenacity of Cathy Rush in a time where she was supposed to stay home, cook for her husband, and take care of the kids.Five stars all around for the magnificent story of a woman who changed our civilization forever!",5,If we didn't have to struggle we could never harvest the glory!,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1647,"['One', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'Great', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'True', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'down', 'scores', 'games', 'how', 'teams', 'got', 'there.The', 'movie', 'true', 'story', 'Cathy', 'Rush', 'Immaculata', 'girls', 'basketball', 'team', 'Make', 'sure', 'check', 'incredible', 'story', 'online', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'best', 'scenario', 'written', 'life', 'No', 'need', 'imagine', 'make', 'things', 'up', 'had', 'tremendous', 'courage', 'time', '1972', 'pushing', 'everybody', 'limits', 'was', 'using', 'same', 'methods', 'today', 'idiotic', 'parents', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'kid', 'friend', 'instead', 'parenting', 'who', 'want', 'give', 'trophies', 'everybody', 'just', 'participation', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'job', 'probably', 'sued', 'low', 'life', 'are', 'several', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'ESPN', 'production', 'fabulous', 'real', 'team', '1972', 'interviews', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'real', 'interesting', 'things', 'DVD', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'definitely', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'least', 'two', 'scenes', 'movie', 'remind', 'people', 'show', 'younger', 'generation', 'how', 'women', 'were', 'treated', 'just', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'called', 'civilized', 'world', 'Maybe', 'producers', 'cut', 'scenes', 'because', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'people', 'feelings', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'scenes', 'because', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'distract', 'real', 'subject', 'unbelievable', 'courage', 'tenacity', 'Cathy', 'Rush', 'time', 'where', 'was', 'supposed', 'stay', 'home', 'cook', 'husband', 'take', 'care', 'kids.Five', 'stars', 'magnificent', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'changed', 'civilization', 'forever']",The Mighty Macs
