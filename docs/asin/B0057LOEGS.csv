1444835,A30TQET02FLSUX,B0057LOEGS,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 1]","MOVIE RATING:  3.5 starsDirector Thomas McCarthy's latest film, Win Win (2011) follows in the ""youth"" sports movie footsteps of such classics as Hoosiers (1986), Rudy (1993), The Karate Kid (1984), Peaceful Warrior (2006), and Remember The Titans (2000), not to mention several other sports-themed movies that would love to be in that group of classics. Win Win lands on the fence in my opinion...on the cusp of being included with the great sports movies. It probably just needs some time and repeated viewings to be fully appreciated. I saw the film back in the Spring of 2011 when it was still in the theaters. And I definitely want to catch it again on blu-ray. Win Win is a very good film, but it does fall prey to some typical cliches for the genre that I feel have been done enough and in better movies. So while Win Win was good, it wasn't as fresh as I would've liked it to be.Paul Giamatti is excellent as always, delivering a typical quirky performance that he is so well known for. The real surprise here is the hilarious and awesome best friend character played by Bobby Cannavale. Together, these 2 guys generate most of the laughs in the film. But supporting roles by Amy Ryan, Jeffrey Tambor, and Burt Young also shine. The real win in Win Win is the writing in McCarthy's screenplay. The dialogue is superb and the story generally satisfies in all the typical ways we've come to expect from sports movies. I only wish there was something new to grab on to. All the typical events that happen in these genre films happen here. There well done...yes. But too familiar to shine above those that came before.The production design, cinematography, sound, music, and editing are all well executed in Win Win. I saw this movie projected on 35mm film, and it did look a bit muddy on the big screen, but I have a feeling the HD presentation on the blu-ray is much better. You really can't go wrong with giving Win Win a watch. Even though it is a bit predictable, it's a fun, well-acted and enjoyable movie.",3,Win Win may just win you some laughs,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,2015,"['MOVIE', 'RATING', '3.5', 'starsDirector', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'latest', 'film', 'Win', 'Win', '2011', 'youth', 'sports', 'movie', 'footsteps', 'such', 'classics', 'Hoosiers', '1986', 'Rudy', '1993', 'Karate', 'Kid', '1984', 'Peaceful', 'Warrior', '2006', 'Remember', 'Titans', '2000', 'not', 'mention', 'several', 'other', 'sports-themed', 'movies', 'would', 'love', 'be', 'group', 'classics', 'Win', 'Win', 'fence', 'opinion', 'cusp', 'being', 'included', 'great', 'sports', 'movies', 'probably', 'just', 'needs', 'time', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'saw', 'film', 'back', 'Spring', '2011', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'theaters', 'definitely', 'want', 'catch', 'again', 'blu-ray', 'Win', 'Win', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'fall', 'prey', 'typical', 'cliches', 'genre', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'enough', 'better', 'movies', 'So', 'Win', 'Win', 'was', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'fresh', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'be.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'excellent', 'always', 'delivering', 'typical', 'quirky', 'performance', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'real', 'surprise', 'here', 'hilarious', 'awesome', 'best', 'friend', 'character', 'played', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Together', '2', 'guys', 'generate', 'most', 'laughs', 'film', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Burt', 'Young', 'also', 'shine', 'real', 'win', 'Win', 'Win', 'writing', 'McCarthy', 'screenplay', 'dialogue', 'superb', 'story', 'generally', 'typical', 'ways', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'sports', 'movies', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'something', 'new', 'grab', 'typical', 'events', 'happen', 'genre', 'films', 'happen', 'here', 'well', 'done', 'yes', 'too', 'familiar', 'shine', 'came', 'production', 'design', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'music', 'editing', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'Win', 'Win', 'saw', 'movie', 'projected', '35mm', 'film', 'did', 'look', 'bit', 'muddy', 'big', 'screen', 'have', 'feeling', 'HD', 'presentation', 'blu-ray', 'much', 'better', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'giving', 'Win', 'Win', 'watch', 'Even', 'bit', 'predictable', 'fun', 'well-acted', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",N/A

Out of nowhere the client's grandson, who is running away from the grandfather's estranged daughter, appears. The lawyer is also the coach of the local high school's wrestling team, himself a former member of the team.  As it turns out, the runaway is a great wrestler.  The coach and one of his buddies (also a former high school wrestler) exploit this opportunity to get some wins for their otherwise pathetic team.  As the story unfolds, the viewer is presented with some funny perspectives on domestic life and the challenges of making ends meet.  The lawyer is played by one of today's best actors - Paul Giamatti.  His sidekick is his former wrestling teammate, and is very funny as a wealthy individual overwhelmed with his divorce.  He has a funny perspective on life, and his and Giamatti's approaches clash to great humorous effect.  The film's humor is tempered by some serious issues: the boy's relationship with his mother; the lawyer's motives in becoming the guardian for the grandfather.  Giamatti showcases once again his great acting talent.  Amy Ryan is terrific as his wife.  Bobby Cannavale is hysterical as Giamatti's sidekick.  The movie affirms the value of integrity and deals deftly with familial relationships, all while providing a steady diet of humor.  The movie is about the struggle to make ends meet, the choices we make when meeting that challenge, and how those choices affect the lives of others, including those closest to us.",5,A Good Movie about Daily Struggles,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,1589,"['hard', 'luck', 'lawyer', 'small', 'town', 'opportunity', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'becoming', 'guardian', 'elderly', 'man', 'nowhere', 'client', 'grandson', 'who', 'running', 'away', 'grandfather', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'lawyer', 'also', 'coach', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'wrestling', 'team', 'former', 'member', 'team', 'out', 'runaway', 'great', 'wrestler', 'coach', 'one', 'buddies', 'also', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'wrestler', 'opportunity', 'get', 'wins', 'otherwise', 'pathetic', 'team', 'story', 'unfolds', 'viewer', 'presented', 'funny', 'perspectives', 'domestic', 'life', 'challenges', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'lawyer', 'played', 'one', 'today', 'best', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'sidekick', 'former', 'wrestling', 'teammate', 'very', 'funny', 'wealthy', 'individual', 'overwhelmed', 'divorce', 'funny', 'perspective', 'life', 'Giamatti', 'approaches', 'clash', 'great', 'humorous', 'effect', 'film', 'humor', 'tempered', 'serious', 'issues', 'boy', 'relationship', 'mother', 'lawyer', 'motives', 'becoming', 'guardian', 'grandfather', 'Giamatti', 'once', 'again', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'terrific', 'wife', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'hysterical', 'Giamatti', 'sidekick', 'movie', 'value', 'integrity', 'deals', 'deftly', 'familial', 'relationships', 'providing', 'steady', 'diet', 'humor', 'movie', 'struggle', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'choices', 'make', 'when', 'meeting', 'challenge', 'how', 'choices', 'affect', 'lives', 'others', 'including', 'closest']",N/A

I watched this at my friend's house and we loved it, then I watched it again with my 18 year old and husband. And I plan on watching it again with my 14 year old when he returns from camp.Wonderfully acted, comical, touching, well scripted. The kid who played Kyle was amazing and I will certainly watch anything he is in again.The story is about a lawyer, Mike Flaherty, who is struggling to make ends meet to support his wife and two daughters. He is appointed by the court to represent an elderly man, Leo, suffering from dementia, who has no one to look after him. He takes on the job of his guardian, for $1500 a month, and promptly parks him in a nursing/retirement home. When he returns to check on the house, he finds the old man's 16 year old grandson (Kyle), who Leo has never met before, on the doorstep. Kyle has left his home in Ohio because his mom (Leo's daughter, who hasn't seen him Leo in 20 years) is in rehab and her boyfriend Craig beats him up. Mike takes him in while they try to contact his mother, Kyle joins the high school wrestling team ... And the movie goes from there. There are so many witty lines and funny moments, not funny like a lot of the crap you see today but genuinely funny.Paul Giamatti is fabulous and I plan on renting other movies he has been in. Jeffrey Tambor is excellent as always. And Bobby Cannavale is hilarious as Mike's best friend and over-eager 'assistant coach'. Amy Ryan plays Mike's wife Jackie quite well.

1444842,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B0057LOEGS,David Bower,"[3, 3]","This is a touching movie about people who appear to be very similar to the family next door, at least in a figurative sense. They are the type of people you might expect to see walking down the sidewalk in many communities; they are average in appearance and bearing and sort of blend in with the crowd. This, amazingly, is one of the major strengths of this movie, there is a naturalness that leaves one feeling real life situations are being somehow observed and recorded.These observations are my effort to try and pay this movie a very high compliment; it is so well done that it is easy to develop feelings of sympathy and understanding for every character played by the carefully selected cast.Paul Giamatti effectively plays the part of Mike Flaherty, an attorney who is struggling to make ends meet and support his family. His wife, Jackie Flaherty, played by Amy Ryan, is equally effective as his loving and understanding wife.Mike, feeling financial pressure, makes a questionable decision which begins to backfire when circumstances, in the person of Kyle, a teen age boy played by Alex Shaffer, create a series of events which dramatically impact their lives and potentially change everything.The boy needs a second chance and Mike needs the boy's help so an informal deal is struck. A new set of problems develop when the boy's mother shows up with her own agenda. The climax comes when Mike needs a second chance from Kyle, the question being will Kyle give Mike a second chance. The resolution of all of these situations makes for a fascinating movie which draws the viewer into the complexities of contemporary American family life.There is a minimal amount of mild profanity, especially at the start of the movie, but the overall impression is of an interesting story of family life in today's economic and social environment. The story, direction, acting and scenery are all beautifully done and create a compelling movie.It is a standout, I recommend it highly.",5,A Fortunate Movie About Second Chances,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,1980,"['touching', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'very', 'similar', 'family', 'next', 'door', 'least', 'figurative', 'sense', 'are', 'type', 'people', 'might', 'expect', 'see', 'walking', 'down', 'sidewalk', 'many', 'communities', 'are', 'average', 'appearance', 'bearing', 'sort', 'blend', 'crowd', 'amazingly', 'one', 'major', 'strengths', 'movie', 'naturalness', 'one', 'feeling', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'are', 'being', 'somehow', 'observed', 'recorded.These', 'observations', 'are', 'effort', 'try', 'pay', 'movie', 'very', 'high', 'compliment', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'easy', 'develop', 'feelings', 'sympathy', 'understanding', 'character', 'played', 'carefully', 'selected', 'cast.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'effectively', 'part', 'Mike', 'Flaherty', 'attorney', 'who', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'support', 'family', 'wife', 'Jackie', 'Flaherty', 'played', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'equally', 'effective', 'loving', 'understanding', 'wife.Mike', 'feeling', 'financial', 'pressure', 'questionable', 'decision', 'backfire', 'when', 'circumstances', 'person', 'Kyle', 'teen', 'age', 'boy', 'played', 'Alex', 'Shaffer', 'create', 'series', 'events', 'dramatically', 'impact', 'lives', 'potentially', 'change', 'everything.The', 'boy', 'second', 'chance', 'Mike', 'boy', 'help', 'so', 'informal', 'deal', 'struck', 'new', 'set', 'problems', 'develop', 'when', 'boy', 'mother', 'up', 'own', 'agenda', 'climax', 'when', 'Mike', 'second', 'chance', 'Kyle', 'question', 'being', 'will', 'Kyle', 'give', 'Mike', 'second', 'chance', 'resolution', 'situations', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'viewer', 'complexities', 'contemporary', 'American', 'family', 'minimal', 'amount', 'mild', 'profanity', 'especially', 'start', 'movie', 'overall', 'impression', 'interesting', 'story', 'family', 'life', 'today', 'economic', 'social', 'environment', 'story', 'direction', 'acting', 'scenery', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'create', 'compelling', 'movie.It', 'standout', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A

1444844,A3S6YZMZLUSLM0,B0057LOEGS,Dean A. Anderson,"[1, 3]","I wrestled in Junior High and High School. To say that wrestling did not receive the same kind of attention as football or basketball would be an understatement. We didn't get as many fans as track or girl's volleyball. Maybe even the Dungeons and Dragons Club.During my Piner High years, the drill team was forced to attend. On more than one occasion I heard the reaction of certain girls on the team to the sweaty, six minutes of grabbling on the mat as ""yuck"" rather than ""yeah"".So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the film, ""Win, Win"", which is partially about high school wrestling has not done boffo box office. But it is a good film and only partially about wresting.Mainly it is the story of a struggling lawyer, Mike Flarety, (Paul Giamatti of the excellent ""John Adams"" mini-series) who takes on the guardianship of an old man, Leo, (Burt Young from the Rocky films) primarily for the money. Instead of giving personal care to Leo, Mike puts the man into a nursing home.The lawyer's wife, Jackie, (Amy Ryan of ""The Wire"" and ""The Office"") becomes aware the guardianship only when the old man's grandson, Kyle, (Alex Shaffer from nothing else, but he does a great job) shows up on the porch of the old man's house. Mike and Jackie decide to take Kyle into their home.Mike has an another job as the high school wrestling coach of a very bad team. He discovers that Kyle is a very good wrestler. So good that he might turn the team's fortunes around.When Leo's daughter (Kyle's mother) shows up unexpectedly, complications ensue.Throughout the film, questions of motivation keep cropping up.Does Mike agree to look after Leo only for the money, or does he care about the crazy old guy?Does Mike care about Kyle just because he's a needy, likable kid, or because he's a great wrestler?Is Leo's daughter looking to get her family back together, or is she just there for her father's money?If we are honest with ourselves, most of our choices in life are made with a variety of motives, from altruistic to selfish. The apostle Paul often wrote about our mixed motives in ministry.In Philippians chapter 1, Paul wrote: ""15 It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill...18 But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.""Here Paul seems to be saying, I don't care about the motives, as long as the Gospel is preached, good is done.And yet the same guy writes in the famous Love Chapter, I Corinthians 13, ""2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.""So which is it Paul, do motives matter, or not?In ""Win, Win"", we see the consequences of bad choices made from good motives, and some good choices made with bad motives. And fortunately, how love and forgiveness can redeem both.This film, written and directed by Thomas McCarthy (""The Visitor"" and ""The Station Agent"") is rated R for language (including swearing by minors, something that personally annoys me greatly in films, it hasn't been funny since ""The Bad News Bears"") and brief, unappealing nudity (a mooning). (But it also portrays a strong marriage and church as a normal part of life. Both rare and worthy sites in contemporary films.)",4,Cinematic Win,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,3501,"['wrestled', 'Junior', 'High', 'High', 'School', 'say', 'wrestling', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'same', 'kind', 'attention', 'football', 'basketball', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'many', 'fans', 'track', 'girl', 'volleyball', 'Maybe', 'even', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'Club.During', 'Piner', 'High', 'years', 'drill', 'team', 'was', 'forced', 'attend', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'heard', 'reaction', 'certain', 'girls', 'team', 'sweaty', 'six', 'minutes', 'grabbling', 'mat', 'yuck', 'rather', 'yeah', '.So', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'film', 'Win', 'Win', 'partially', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'wrestling', 'not', 'done', 'boffo', 'box', 'office', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'partially', 'wresting.Mainly', 'story', 'struggling', 'lawyer', 'Mike', 'Flarety', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'excellent', 'John', 'Adams', 'mini-series', 'who', 'guardianship', 'old', 'man', 'Leo', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Rocky', 'films', 'primarily', 'money', 'Instead', 'giving', 'personal', 'care', 'Leo', 'Mike', 'man', 'nursing', 'home.The', 'lawyer', 'wife', 'Jackie', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'Wire', 'Office', 'aware', 'guardianship', 'only', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'grandson', 'Kyle', 'Alex', 'Shaffer', 'nothing', 'else', 'great', 'job', 'up', 'porch', 'old', 'man', 'house', 'Mike', 'Jackie', 'decide', 'take', 'Kyle', 'home.Mike', 'job', 'high', 'school', 'wrestling', 'coach', 'very', 'bad', 'team', 'Kyle', 'very', 'good', 'wrestler', 'So', 'good', 'might', 'turn', 'team', 'fortunes', 'around.When', 'Leo', 'daughter', 'Kyle', 'mother', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'complications', 'ensue.Throughout', 'film', 'questions', 'motivation', 'keep', 'cropping', 'up.Does', 'Mike', 'agree', 'look', 'Leo', 'only', 'money', 'care', 'crazy', 'old', 'guy', 'Mike', 'care', 'Kyle', 'just', 'needy', 'likable', 'kid', 'great', 'wrestler', 'Leo', 'daughter', 'looking', 'get', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'just', 'there', 'father', 'money', 'are', 'honest', 'most', 'choices', 'life', 'are', 'made', 'variety', 'motives', 'altruistic', 'selfish', 'apostle', 'Paul', 'often', 'wrote', 'mixed', 'motives', 'ministry.In', 'Philippians', 'chapter', '1', 'Paul', 'wrote', '15', 'true', 'preach', 'Christ', 'envy', 'rivalry', 'others', 'goodwill', '18', 'what', 'matter', 'important', 'thing', 'way', 'false', 'motives', 'true', 'Christ', 'preached', 'rejoice', 'Here', 'Paul', 'be', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'motives', 'as', 'long', 'Gospel', 'preached', 'good', 'done.And', 'yet', 'same', 'guy', 'writes', 'famous', 'Love', 'Chapter', 'Corinthians', '13', '2', 'have', 'gift', 'prophecy', 'can', 'fathom', 'mysteries', 'knowledge', 'have', 'faith', 'can', 'move', 'mountains', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'love', 'am', 'nothing', '3', 'give', 'possess', 'poor', 'give', 'body', 'hardship', 'may', 'boast', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'love', 'gain', 'nothing', 'So', 'Paul', 'do', 'motives', 'matter', 'not', 'Win', 'Win', 'see', 'consequences', 'bad', 'choices', 'made', 'good', 'motives', 'good', 'choices', 'made', 'bad', 'motives', 'fortunately', 'how', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'can', 'redeem', 'both.This', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'Visitor', 'Station', 'Agent', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'including', 'swearing', 'minors', 'something', 'personally', 'greatly', 'films', ""n't"", 'been', 'funny', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'brief', 'unappealing', 'nudity', 'mooning', 'also', 'strong', 'marriage', 'church', 'normal', 'part', 'life', 'rare', 'worthy', 'sites', 'contemporary', 'films']",N/A
1444845,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0057LOEGS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","Actor Thomas McCarthy is known for his film roles on ""Meet the Parents"", ""2012', ""Michael Clayton"", ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" and TV roles on ""The Wire"" and ""Law & Order"", but the actor is also a writer and filmmaker.But back in high school, he and his good friend Joe Tiboni were also wrestlers and felt that there has not been a wrestling movie created in a very long time.So, the two friends decided to go back to their old neighborhood in Providence, Rhode Island and create a wrestling film.  And sure enough, ""Win Win"" was born.McCarthy got together with another friend, actor Paul Giamatti and in March 2010, ""Win Win"" received a limited release and received positive reviews from film critics nationwide.VIDEO:""Win Win"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  This independent film is shot on film and thus grain is present and for the most part, picture quality is very clear.  Noticed a more cool color overall, I didn't notice any edge enhancement, artifacts or banding.  Good enough detail especially on closeups of the actors faces and black levels are nice and deep.Overall, picture quality for ""Win Win"" looked very good!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Win Win"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Because the film is primarily a dialogue-driven film, it's center and front channel driven.  I didn't notice any major use of surround sound (possibly during the more musical sequences) but dialogue is crisp and clear.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Win Win"" comes with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (1:54) Featuring two deleted scenes.Tom McCarthy and Joe Tiboni Discuss Win Win - (8:29) Tom McCarthy (director/writer) and Joe Tiboni (writer) talk about how they came up with the concept for the film, the local community support and the casting of the talent.Dave Thompson at Sundance 2011 - (2:27) Dave Thompson (who plays the character of ""Stemler"") is interviewed about his experience at Sundance.In Conversation with Tom McCarthy & Paul Giamatti at Sundance 2011 - (2:26) Tom McCarthy and Paul Giamatti talk about working together after being friends for over a decade and also discussion about the film.Family - (2:24) A film preview of ""Win Win"" and interviews with the director and cast of the film.""Think You Can Wait"" Music Video - (4:55) Music video by The National.Theatrical Trailer - (2:22) Theatrical trailer for ""Win Win"".JUDGMENT CALL:""Win Win"" is a heartfelt film and definitely one of the better wrestling films to come out since ""Vision Quest"".""Win Win"" is a very good film as it captures the reality of many Americans who are struggling during the tough economy. In the case of Mike Flaherty, not all lawyers are doing well financially.  No clients equals no income and he is definitely feeling the financial pinch that he makes a questionable decision as an attorney.But what makes the film work is that both director Thomas McCarthy and Joe Tiboni wanted to do a wrestling film but also pulled in some of their real-life situations for this film.  From the look and feel of Mike Flaherty's home, to the office of where he works, the film tries to showcase the reality of the economy hurting a family but also the life of a normal, working man having to make tough decisions, which includes taking in a troubled kid.There is no sugar coating, McCarthy and Tiboni made the film's characters seem real and the situations real as well.  Also, as an independent film, it helps to have the support of your local community, especially when making the wrestling seem interesting, realistic and also showcasing the competition amongst the high school teams.As a former high school wrestler, I can easily remember as a teenager, having to watch ""Vision Quest"" (which our coach made us do) but both McCarthy and Tiboni are right, in the fact that there hasn't been a good film that showcased high school wrestling until ""Win Win"".Everything is captured from the rock n' roll entrance, the coach to wrestler pep talk and also the wrestling on the ground.But most of all, it helps when you have a new actor, especially like Alex Shaffer who plays Kyle.  It's not overacted, everything seems just right.  And both Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan compliment and also enhance Shaffer's acting.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is good, audio quality is dialogue-driven but also very clear and the special features, while it seems that there are many, they are a bit short.  It would have been nice to have an audio commentary by McCarth and Tiboni.Overall, ""Win Win"" is a film that captures you with its sincere filmmaking and heartfelt situations.  Well-acted, well-written and overall, a Blu-ray release worth checking out!",4,"Blu-ray: ""Win Win"" is a film that captures you with its sincere filmmaking and heartfelt situations.",1323993600,"12

1444848,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0057LOEGS,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","Having been impressed by his last directorial effort, 2007'sThe Visitor(which netted lead actor Richard Jenkins a well-deserved Oscar nomination), actor-turned-director/screenwriter Thomas McCarthy shows the same idiosyncratic attention to character in this quiet 2011 dramedy. It has the same ramshackle, off-kilter quality, this time focusing on middle-class New Jersey suburbia and the struggles of conscience that occur during economically challenging times. The protagonist is Mike Flaherty, a small-town attorney whose practice is sinking under the weight of mounting bills. He's also a family man with a wife and two daughters, who moonlights as a high school wrestling coach on a losing streak. While representing Leo Poplar, a man suffering from dementia, he comes up with an unethical plan that has him taking over Leo's guardianship and pocketing $1,500 a month while keeping his client in a nursing home.His plan is not without a certain remorse, and an unexpected turn occurs when Leo's surly 16-year-old grandson Kyle shows up from Ohio to live with his grandfather. Not being a bad guy, Mike takes Kyle into his home where he starts to fit in quite well, especially when it turns out he is a gifted wrestler whose success buoys the spirit of the team. Complicating matters, however, is Kyle's negligent, drug-addicted mother who suddenly shows up to reclaim Kyle and her father. Through it all, McCarthy shows a genuine gift for believable dialogue that unfolds the story without resorting to clich&eacute;s or big moments that take his actors out of character for the sake of the story. In response, the cast he has assembled is superb. In his best big-screen role sinceSideways, Paul Giamatti portrays Mike with a fierce passivity that somehow elicits empathy to his character's sketchy behavior. Amy Ryan is his match as his tough-minded wife Jackie lending a moral certitude that Mike clearly lacks. Together they make one of the most credible married couples I have seen in any recent film.Jeffrey Tambor lends his innate weariness to Mike's office mate who also happens to coach the wrestling team, and Bobby Cannavale, who worked with McCarthy on his first film, 2003'sThe Station Agent, provides his particular motor-mouthed energy to Mike's oblivious best friend Terry, a hedge fund manager still manically obsessed with his ex-wife. Burt Young, still best known as Paulie in all theRockyfilms, plays Leo in his familiar mumbling manner. Newcomer Alex Shaffer affectingly plays Kyle like a stone-faced version of Sean Penn's Spicoli inFast Times at Ridgemont Highuntil his character gradually warms to the Flahertys. As his estranged mom Cindy, Melanie Lynskey is touching as a woman whose sense of uncertainty informs her every move. David W. Thompson provides welcome comic relief as Kyle's hopeless insecure teammate Stemler, and Claire Foley is remarkably assured as the Flahertys' eldest daughter Abby. All the plot threads are so deftly handled by McCarthy and his cast that the larger themes of culpability and responsibility resonate on a very human scale.",4,Culpability and Personal Responsibility on a Human Scale Handled by an Excellent Cast,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,3088,"['Having', 'been', 'impressed', 'last', 'directorial', 'effort', ""2007'sThe"", 'Visitor', 'netted', 'lead', 'actor', 'Richard', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'actor-turned-director/screenwriter', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'same', 'idiosyncratic', 'attention', 'character', 'quiet', '2011', 'dramedy', 'same', 'ramshackle', 'off-kilter', 'quality', 'time', 'focusing', 'middle-class', 'New', 'Jersey', 'suburbia', 'struggles', 'conscience', 'occur', 'economically', 'challenging', 'times', 'protagonist', 'Mike', 'Flaherty', 'small-town', 'attorney', 'practice', 'sinking', 'weight', 'mounting', 'bills', 'also', 'family', 'man', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'wrestling', 'coach', 'losing', 'streak', 'representing', 'Leo', 'Poplar', 'man', 'suffering', 'dementia', 'up', 'unethical', 'plan', 'taking', 'over', 'Leo', 'guardianship', 'pocketing', '1,500', 'month', 'keeping', 'client', 'nursing', 'home.His', 'plan', 'not', 'certain', 'remorse', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'when', 'Leo', 'surly', '16-year-old', 'grandson', 'Kyle', 'up', 'Ohio', 'live', 'grandfather', 'Not', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', 'Mike', 'Kyle', 'home', 'where', 'fit', 'quite', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'out', 'gifted', 'wrestler', 'success', 'spirit', 'team', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'however', 'Kyle', 'negligent', 'drug-addicted', 'mother', 'who', 'suddenly', 'up', 'reclaim', 'Kyle', 'father', 'McCarthy', 'genuine', 'gift', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'story', 'resorting', 'clich', 'eacute', 'big', 'moments', 'take', 'actors', 'character', 'sake', 'story', 'response', 'cast', 'assembled', 'superb', 'best', 'big-screen', 'role', 'sinceSideways', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Mike', 'fierce', 'passivity', 'somehow', 'empathy', 'character', 'sketchy', 'behavior', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'match', 'tough-minded', 'wife', 'Jackie', 'lending', 'moral', 'certitude', 'Mike', 'clearly', 'Together', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'credible', 'married', 'couples', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'film.Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'innate', 'weariness', 'Mike', 'office', 'mate', 'who', 'also', 'coach', 'wrestling', 'team', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'who', 'worked', 'McCarthy', 'first', 'film', ""2003'sThe"", 'Station', 'Agent', 'particular', 'motor-mouthed', 'energy', 'Mike', 'oblivious', 'best', 'friend', 'Terry', 'hedge', 'fund', 'manager', 'still', 'manically', 'obsessed', 'ex-wife', 'Burt', 'Young', 'still', 'best', 'known', 'Paulie', 'theRockyfilms', 'plays', 'Leo', 'familiar', 'mumbling', 'manner', 'Newcomer', 'Alex', 'Shaffer', 'affectingly', 'Kyle', 'stone-faced', 'version', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Spicoli', 'inFast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'Highuntil', 'character', 'gradually', 'Flahertys', 'estranged', 'mom', 'Cindy', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'touching', 'woman', 'sense', 'uncertainty', 'informs', 'move', 'David', 'W.', 'Thompson', 'welcome', 'comic', 'relief', 'Kyle', 'hopeless', 'insecure', 'teammate', 'Stemler', 'Claire', 'Foley', 'remarkably', 'assured', 'Flahertys', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Abby', 'plot', 'threads', 'are', 'so', 'deftly', 'handled', 'McCarthy', 'cast', 'larger', 'themes', 'culpability', 'responsibility', 'resonate', 'very', 'human', 'scale']",N/A
1444849,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0057LOEGS,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 1]","WIN WIN (2011) is an excellent family film. While I am a huge fan of Paul Giamatti, I hesitate to call this ""a Paul Giamatti film"" - as I'm sure others might be tempted to do. I have noted an animosity toward Giamatti because ""he always plays himself"". While I think that is absurd and somewhat amateurish a statement, he does bring a singular quality.That is what Giamatti does here. As a beleaguered lawyer with a failing practice, Giamatti somehow gets entangled in the guardianship of a wealthy old man (the great Burt Young) who is in the first stages of dementia. What is unexpected - and the true star of this film - is the old man's grandson (Alex Shaffer, kid's got a big future ahead of him).When the lawyer, an assistant high school wrestling coach, discovers the boy's superhuman wrestling champion qualities, well, who wouldn't understand the simple storyline.The boy is not only the star, he's even on the internet due to his high school wrestling career. ""He has man-strength!"", remarks one of the characters. In a story I will not spoil, there is warmhearted humor, tense emotion and a certain something that reminds me of the good old television family films that once graced our stations. The performances are sharp, exquisite and just plain fun. This is no huge blockbuster, no Oscar-winner I'm sure - but it is one of the finest films I've enjoyed these many decades.If I will criticize anything it is the rather hasty, somewhat limp ending, and at an hour and forty minutes, they could have done much better. When a film deals with the true meaning of love and sacrifice, there should be a sharp punctuation mark at the end of that statement - that is lacking here. Otherwise, you cannot pass up the chance to see a very funny, capable Giamatti leading a very funny, capable cast.In addition to Giamatti and Young, the cast is well rounded with the likes of Amy Ryan, Bobby Cannavale, Jeffrey Tambor, Melanie Lynskey, Margot Martindale and a host of capable bit players. This is set in New Jersey and I suspect several of the good folk of New York (where it was filmed) also made brief appearances.

1444851,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0057LOEGS,Grady Harp,"[11, 11]","Tom McCarthy is a young gifted artist - actor, writer, director - who has gifted us in the past with such memorable small films as writer/director of  'The Visitor', 'The Station Agent', and as writer for 'Up'.  He deals with simple people encountering complex problems and shows us how cooperative relationships make life OK. McCarthy both wrote (with Joe Tiboni) and directed WIN WIN and if there were two words that would best describe this film the title supplies them.  It is real, touching without becoming saccharine, and populated by a cast of some very fine actors who deliver a very human story.Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) is a sown on his luck lawyer in poor economic times who deals with elderly people as clients.  His loyal wife Jackie (Amy Ryan) keeps their small house in Providence, New Jersey (McCarthy's home town, by the way) in order, managing their two daughters, the funky Abby (Clare Foley) and Stella (Penelope Kindred), in tow.  One of Mike's clients Leo Poplar (Burt Young) is entering early senility and the court wants him placed in a home.  Discovering that Leo pays good money for a guardian Mike accepts guardianship but moves Leo into a rest home, keeping his house locked up. Mike discovers a young 16 year old kid on Leo's doorstep and learns that the lad is Kyle (Alex Schaffer), Leo's grandson form Ohio who has run away from home because his mother (Melanie Lynskey) is in rehab and Kyle has escaped the abuse of her boyfriend.  Kyle is taken in to the Flaherty family (tough Jackie melts and insists they support him). What Mike discovers is that Kyle is a Wrestling Champion and Mike happens to coach the high school wrestling team with his law partner Stephen Vigman (Jeffrey Tambor) and Mike's buddy Terry Delfino (Bobby Cannavale).  Kyle's presence eventually leads the losing team to a winning position: Kyle is sensitive to the nerdy loser Stemler (David Thompson) and boosts the entire team's spirit.  Problems arise: Cindy comes to town to claim Leo (and get his money) and hires lawyer Eleanor (Margo Martindale) to meet her aims.  Mike's finagling of Leo's money backfires, Kyle loses faith in his new family, Leo only wants to go to his home, and all things seem to fall apart until unexpected changes occur in each of the characters.Some viewers will see this as yet another 'Blind Side' type movie - and that is a Positive!  Too few films deal with the sanctity of the family and the manner in which true family relationships can improve society at large.  Tom McCarthy has managed to create a tender, humorous, realistic, and deeply touching film.  Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan once again prove they are among our finest actors, but it the surprise debut of Alex Schaffer, a 17 year old lad who has been a wrestler but has no prior acting credits, that makes this film glow.  The cameos by Burt Young, Jeffrey Tambor, Bobby Cannavale, Melanie Lynskey, and Margo Martindale along with all the other minor characters are superb.  This is a film to restore faith in human kindness - a film that would benefit time together with youngsters and adults to observe how the world can tick.

1444852,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B0057LOEGS,Green Manalishi,"[0, 0]","This is the best Giamatti movie I've seen since ""Sideways"" which was brilliant.  If you like good drama, screenplay, acting, story and characters, well, you've come to the right movie.  Giamatti is often as good as the co-stars he's working with, and this film is no different.  He is also not his typical morose character in this film but much more realistic and well-rounded with a nice family to boot.  He's a lawyer and family man but not doing so well financially who decides to take a stipend to take care of one of his elderly clients who is near dementia.  Sounds exciting right?  One day he finds the old man's grandson sitting on the doorstep of his grandfather's house, a runaway of sorts whose mother is in rehab.  They end up letting the kid stay at their house for a couple of days only to find out later the kid wrestles.  This works out good because Giamatti's character also happens to be a wrestling coach.  The movie is not so much a Rocky film (although you'll recognize the guy who plays the old man from the movie Rocky ""Adrian's crooked brother"" - Burt Young) but more of a character study and a study of the effect this boy's character has on the team and Giamatti's family.  While Giamatti is the big name here, it's the kid (Alex Shaffer) that brings this movie to life (and steals the show).  But there's no doubt that Giamatti (and all the actors), did a great job with their roles as well. They were so believable.  The movie seemed to have a transformative effect on their personas.  I was glad to see Giamatti play a non-depressive character for once and surprised to see how well he slipped into it.As I said, I'd put Win Win in the same league with Sideways, which is to say it's a pure class movie that wins on every front though first and foremost is that it's wholly entertaining.  That is due to other such factors as a very well-written script, excellent acting and actors, and fine direction.",5,Excellent - Don't Miss It If You Liked Sideways,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,1931,"['best', 'Giamatti', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sideways', 'was', 'brilliant', 'like', 'good', 'drama', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'story', 'characters', 'well', ""'ve"", 'come', 'right', 'movie', 'Giamatti', 'often', 'as', 'good', 'co-stars', 'working', 'film', 'different', 'also', 'not', 'typical', 'morose', 'character', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'well-rounded', 'nice', 'family', 'boot', 'lawyer', 'family', 'man', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'financially', 'who', 'take', 'stipend', 'take', 'care', 'one', 'elderly', 'clients', 'who', 'dementia', 'exciting', 'right', 'One', 'day', 'old', 'man', 'grandson', 'sitting', 'doorstep', 'grandfather', 'house', 'runaway', 'sorts', 'mother', 'rehab', 'end', 'up', 'letting', 'kid', 'stay', 'house', 'couple', 'days', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'kid', 'out', 'good', 'Giamatti', 'character', 'also', 'be', 'wrestling', 'coach', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Rocky', 'film', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'guy', 'who', 'old', 'man', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'Adrian', 'crooked', 'brother', 'Burt', 'Young', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'study', 'effect', 'boy', 'character', 'team', 'Giamatti', 'family', 'Giamatti', 'big', 'name', 'here', 'kid', 'Alex', 'Shaffer', 'movie', 'life', 'show', 'doubt', 'Giamatti', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'so', 'believable', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'transformative', 'effect', 'personas', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Giamatti', 'play', 'non-depressive', 'character', 'once', 'surprised', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'slipped', 'it.As', 'said', ""'d"", 'put', 'Win', 'Win', 'same', 'league', 'Sideways', 'say', 'pure', 'class', 'movie', 'front', 'first', 'foremost', 'wholly', 'entertaining', 'due', 'other', 'such', 'factors', 'very', 'well-written', 'script', 'excellent', 'acting', 'actors', 'fine', 'direction']",N/A

Danzig,"[3, 9]","As a lifelong contrarian and truth-teller, I feel compelled to leave some counterpoint to the uniform chorus of raves and five-star reviews this film has won-won here at Amazon.This is a modest family drama about a schlumpy middle-aged lawyer and high-school wrestling coach trying to make ends meet, and IMO (and Roger Ebert's as well), the rewards of viewing it are in turn modest.It plays pretty much like one of those after-school specials on TV, although admittedly with a good script and better actors.The film has been described as a ninety-minute ""situation comedy,"" but that implies that it is actually funny.  Though Bobby Cannavale works hard in the best friend role to inject some humor into the proceedings, his efforts fall flat.The best I can say for this film is that in an industry over-saturated with noisy blockbusters populated by giant robots and one-dimensional comic book heroes, such a realistic and low-key effort can provide a very welcome change of pace.But I have to wonder if all but the most avid DVD collectors -- or Paul Giamatti fans, most notably probably his parents, wife, and agent -- would ever need or want to see this film a second time.I don't know about you, but a great film makes me feel something.  Either it gets my heart pumping, or it moves me to tears or laughter -- it evokes some kind of powerful reaction.

""Win Win,"" McCarthy's latest film, is another funny, touching film in the same vein, and one that promises to bring McCarthy a larger audience.Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) is a small-town New Jersey lawyer and high-school wrestling coach with a loving wife (Amy Ryan), two adorable small daughters, and a rapidly failing law practice. Desperate to make ends meet, he finagles his way into becoming the court-appointed guardian of one of his clients--Leo Poplar (Burt Young), an old man in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's--and pockets the $1,500-per-month guardian fee. However, Mike didn't count on the sudden appearance of Kyle Timmons (Alex Shaffer), the teenage son of Cindy (Melanie Lynskey) Leo's long-estranged junkie daughter. A sullen, bleach-blond kid, Kyle is a troublesome guest in the Flaherty household until the day Mike brings Kyle along to wrestling practice. Kyle turns out to be a wrestling whiz, and Mike suddenly has dreams of taking his team to the state championship. But soon Cindy shows up, sending Kyle into violent rebellion and threatening Mike's sweet deal with the court.Never quite taking the audience where it expects to go, ""Win Win"" is a quirky and beguiling film about the growing bond between Mike and Kyle, how that bond is threatened, and what Mike is willing to do to preserve it. The cast could not be bettered. Giamatti, Ryan, Young and Lynskey are all superb, as are Jeffrey Tambor as Mike's fussbudget assistant coach and Bobby Cannavale as Mike's newly divorced buddy. Alex Shaffer, a high-school wrestling champion who was cast for his wrestling prowess, gives a touching and natural performance as Kyle; I hope to see him in more movies.

So it is here with a fine screenplay and direction by Tom McCarthy.  Giamatti is Mike Flaherty, a struggling attorney in small town New Jersey.  One of his few clients is an elderly man (Burt Young) who is in the early stages of dementia.  He lives alone, but can no longer care for himself.  His only known relative is a daughter that is in a long stretch of rehab in Ohio.  Mike convinces the court that he will care for Leo (Young) in order to get the $1500 monthly stipend.  Mike doesn't tell his wife (Ryan) or anyone else, and then violates Leo's wishes by moving him into an upscale assisted living facility.  This all seems highly unethical, and it is.  But at the same time you can sympathize with Mike and his predicament.  What Mike doesn't count on however, is a surprise appearance by Leo's grandson Kyle (Alex Shaffer) who shows up looking for a grandpa he's never met.  It turns out Kyle is a gifted high school wrestler who was kicked off his previous team for stealing a car.  Kyle has issues, clearly associated with his mother and her boyfriend.Mike, Jackie and their two young daughters take Kyle in and they accept him into their family.  Young Kyle then manages to elevate his new high school's wrestling team who is coached part time by Mike and a couple of his  long time friends. McCarthy manages to make each character somewhat sympathetic even the mother who eventually shows up wanting her son back as well as any money her dad may have.

This is not just a film about human nature, as much as a hopeful suggestion that an individual can make the right choices. Certainly humans are frail and make bad decisions, but this delves a bit more into the decisions that lead to the bad decisions.McCarthy's witty screenplay is a complete character study involving many different situations. A cast of very reliable Indie actors is on hand--Paul Giamatti, Amy Ryan, Burt Young, Bobby Cannavale, Jeffrey Tambor--totally committed to the tale being told. Also, an earthy performance from Melanie Lynskey, whom I haven't seen since she played Kate Winslet's crony in ""Heavenly Creatures"".Most impressive, to me at least, is a young non-professional actor, Alex Shaffer, as a neglected kid, good at heart, but lonely and confused, who's learned to be independent. Shaffer is a natural.Other reviewers have complained that these are unlikeable characters, but I don't agree. Some bad decisions may have not gone well, but I saw innate goodness come as a result.

All you need is a good story. Paul Giamatti (one of my favorite actors) plays a down-on-his-luck lawyer, high school wrestling coach and family man looking to earn extra cash on the side. His attempt to do this proves to be more than he bargained for. At best, Giamatti's character extended a ""helping"" hand in a dishonest way; at worst his actions may have gotten him disbarred or been illegal. In any case, his plan leads him to an Ohioan teenager named Kyle (played in a stoically excellent way by Alex Shaffer), a sweet kid with a troubled background -- and a surprising talent that helps him bond with his newfound family.Though the plot may sound troubling, this is actually a really funny movie with many charming and genuine moments. Throughout the tale, Giamatti is blessed to have the fun-loving company of Terry and Stephen (played by Bobby Cannavale and Jeffrey Tambor, respectively), his friends who help out as assistant wrestling coaches. It's fun to watch this trio of guys -- inspired mightily by Kyle -- work together to incorporate an uplifted work ethic and attitude in the team they coach.Inspiring but not schmaltzy and true-to-life with an ending that seems plausible to me, ""Win Win"" is a real gem.Last but not least, it was cool to see Burt Young -- Paulie from the Rocky movies -- get a prominent role!",4,A winner,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,1457,"['Movies', 'Win', 'Win', 'prove', 'once', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'overpaid', 'actors', 'actresses', 'huge', 'budgets', 'make', 'worthy', 'film', 'need', 'good', 'story', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'down-on-his-luck', 'lawyer', 'high', 'school', 'wrestling', 'coach', 'family', 'man', 'looking', 'earn', 'extra', 'cash', 'side', 'attempt', 'do', 'be', 'more', 'bargained', 'best', 'Giamatti', 'character', 'extended', 'helping', 'hand', 'dishonest', 'way', 'worst', 'actions', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'disbarred', 'been', 'illegal', 'case', 'plan', 'Ohioan', 'teenager', 'named', 'Kyle', 'played', 'stoically', 'excellent', 'way', 'Alex', 'Shaffer', 'sweet', 'kid', 'troubled', 'background', 'surprising', 'talent', 'bond', 'newfound', 'plot', 'may', 'sound', 'troubling', 'actually', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'many', 'charming', 'genuine', 'moments', 'tale', 'Giamatti', 'blessed', 'have', 'fun-loving', 'company', 'Terry', 'Stephen', 'played', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'respectively', 'friends', 'who', 'help', 'out', 'assistant', 'wrestling', 'coaches', 'fun', 'watch', 'trio', 'guys', 'inspired', 'mightily', 'Kyle', 'work', 'together', 'incorporate', 'uplifted', 'work', 'ethic', 'attitude', 'team', 'coach.Inspiring', 'not', 'schmaltzy', 'true-to-life', 'ending', 'plausible', 'Win', 'Win', 'real', 'gem.Last', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Paulie', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'get', 'prominent', 'role']",N/A

Paul Giamatti plays a lawyer who isn't doing too well financially (apparently he doesn't handle bankruptcies). He has an aged rich client Leo Poplar, (Burt Young, Pauly from Rocky) who is in the early stages of dementia. Unable to contact Leo's daughter in Ohio (we later find out she was in rehab) he goes to court and gets appointed as his legal guardian/caretaker. The state was going to place Leo in a care facility, however Giamatti convinces the judge Leo would be better at home and agrees to take care of Leo at home...for the $1500 a month fee. As it turns out Giamatti was dishonest (not a lawyer!) and puts Leo in a home anyway, telling him it was the judge's orders.As fate would have it, Kyle, Leo's 16 year old grandson from Ohio is sitting on his doorstop as Paul drives by. He takes Kyle in temporarily. Paul also coaches the HS wrestling team which doesn't win matches. As it turns out Kyle is a ringer. When Kyle's hated mother shows up, she throws a wrench into the works as Paul's deception has become uncovered.The characters in the story are realistic, they all have flaws that must be dealt with. When they have an opportunity to redeem themselves, like a good Disney flick they all take it. As a family film, I have to question some things. The movie drops the F bomb in stages. Kyle runs away from home in Ohio and takes the bus. Kyle at one point pushes his mother down on a bed and holds her down in anger.The acting was great. Alex Schaffer did a good job as Kyle.

1444891,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0057LOEGS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","""Win Win"", the new film from writer/director Tom McCarthy (""The Visitor"", ""The Station Agent""), is a charming, funny, poignant and predictable comedy. Given the overall quality of the film, I can live with the few predictable moments.Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) is a struggling lawyer in a New Jersey suburb whose clients, senior citizens, are dying, and leaving him with shrinking revenues. His wife, Jackie (Amy Ryan, ""Gone Baby Gone"", TV's ""The Office"") stays at home to raise their kids. He also coaches the high school wrestling team, a team both he and his buddy, Terry Delfino (Bobby Cannavale, ""The Station Agent"") were members of in high school. But Mike is having trouble with the team's terrible losing streak. One day, Mike comes up with the idea to become the court appointed guardian of one of his clients, Leo (Burt Young). Leo wants to stay at home and Mike promises to make this happen in an effort to earn the $1,500 monthly commission. Instead, he finds a nursing home nearby and gets Leo situated. Just as soon as everything is settled, Kyle (Alex Shaffer), Leo's long lost grandson, shows up, looking for a place to stay; Kyle's mom is in Rehab and even if she weren't, he doesn't want to live with her. Mike and Jackie take Kyle in until they can figure out what to do. Kyle asks Mike to take him to wrestling practice one day and then asks if he can workout with the other kids. Mike and his assistant coach, Stephen (Jeffrey Tambor) are surprised to see Kyle has a lot of great skills. There just might be hope after all.When I think about Tom McCarthy's films, the first thing that comes to mind are the interesting characters he creates. McCarthy is actually a very recognizable and prolific character actor who has appeared in a large number of films and television shows. You would recognize him immediately and say ""Oh, yeah. Him!"". A large number of his film appearances have been in well-respected films. I'm not sure if this makes him a better writer/director, but something is working. In each of the films he has directed, the characters seem like people we might meet on the street, but each is a little odd or has a strange little quirk. Because he starts off in a real place and then takes the actors to a different or strange place, everything about his films seems more human. ""The Station Agent"" was a pretty funny film, featuring some very memorable performances. ""The Visitor"" was a better film, less funny, but more involving and poignant. Now, ""Win Win"" seems to combine the best elements of both.Mike is a struggling lawyer with a very small practice. Finding time to coach the high school wrestling team is not a problem because Mike's client base, senior citizens, shrinks with each client's death, so he tries to make ends meet by doing 'overflow' work for another law firm. When this starts to dry up, he becomes a bit desperate. His newest client, Leo, is about to be made a ward of the State of New Jersey; he frequently gets confused, he has no relatives, he hasn't seen his daughter in 20 years, he will be taken out of his home. But Mike decides he should be made Leo's guardian. He tells the judge he will ensure Leo stays in his home, which is what Leo wants. But as soon as Mike becomes the guardian, he puts Leo in a nice local rest home and starts to visit. The reality of the situation is very different from what Mike promises will happen.McCarthy spends some time setting up Mike's world, giving us a look at all of the different facets of his life. Mike and Jackie clearly love each other, are clearly devoted to each other and have also been together a long time. They almost seem to have a second language between them.Then Kyle enters the picture. The teen is not portrayed in a typical way, he is shy, quiet and troubled, but he also engages with Mike and Jackie and their kids, showing interest in their lives, wanting to become involved. And he also seems to enjoy spending time with his grandfather, just sitting and watching television.Giamatti's performance is not groundbreaking. In fact, it is very similar to many other performances on his IMDb list. Mike is struggling--- to make money, to keep his health in check, to keep things in control. He loses his temper and tries to be supportive and loving. It is a performance we have seen Giamatti play before and he does it well. His desperation leads him to do something he probably wouldn't have done otherwise and we see why this is a necessary step for his character.Amy Ryan is really good as Jackie. When she first learns of Kyle, her maternal instincts kick in and she becomes concerned for this kid, for him, wanting to protect him. But her New Jersey instincts also kick in and she becomes concerned for her family, wanting to protect them. She doesn't know Kyle and he could be dangerous. But the mother in her wins and she agrees to bring him into their house.Jackie is a very well rounded character and Ryan reveals Jackie's different subtleties throughout. At one point, Kyle asks her if he can go to the store with her. She's shocked. Why does this teenager want to spend time with an adult? But during the trip, they get to know a few things about each other. Jackie quickly realizes Kyle wants to do these things because he misses this level of connection; it is missing in his relationship with his mom.Cannavale's Terry is the comic relief. He and Mike have been buddies forever and while Terry seems to be better off - bigger, newer car and apartment - his life is actually in more of a shambles. A painful divorce has left a void in his life. I know, sounds funny doesn't it. But Terry is so insecure and Cannavale uses this insecurity to make the character funny. When Terry realizes Mike might actually be able to coach his team to a few victories, he immediately pressures Mike and Stephen to let him become an Assistant Coach. That is how desperate he is for something positive to happen in his life.This proves to irk Stephen (Tambor) and the two become child-like as they try to earn the attention of 'dad' Mike.Alex Shaffer plays Kyle. As soon as he shows up, complete with bleached white hair, Mike and Jackie don't know what to make of him. But as he spends more time with them, it becomes evident he is just a normal teen who has had some rough times with his mom. He needs, even seems to crave, a connection with a normal family. This need isn't immediately evident; he's a teenager so he seems to take everything in stride and shows little emotion.Shaffer brings such a low-key quality to the performance; it is difficult to tell if he is acting, if he is simply reading his lines, or if he is a brilliant young actor. In a way, the monotone timbre of his speech seems to fit perfectly with his character. A troubled teen, he seems pretty quiet when he first meets the Flaherty family. They accept this because they realize they have to earn his trust, as he has to earn theirs. He has to become comfortable in order to open up to them.Thankfully, Kyle is not the stereotypical rebellious teenager. He doesn't seem angry and upset at the world, just his mom. Maybe that does make him a typical teenager. As he spends time with the Flaherty family, he opens up, engages, asks questions, and becomes involved. This makes Kyle different from most teens and makes him more interesting.But Shaffer's level tone of voice caused me to wonder, on more than one occasion, if he was simply reading his lines. The performance is more than that. As Kyle begins to feel more comfortable, he becomes chattier. It is a good, realistic portrayal of a troubled teen.One of the best things about McCarthy's films is they are filled with rich observations, moments we wouldn't see in other films, but in these films, they add another level of detail. In ""The Visitor"", Richard Jenkins' character exudes a palpable feeling of dread and loneliness. Then, he meets the immigrant couple who have been unintentionally squatting in his New York apartment and things begin to change. When he begins to play the drums, you see the joy, the relief in his face. In ""Win Win"", there are many moments. Kyle visits his grandfather and they just sit and watch TV and both seem to enjoy their time together. Later, after Kyle joins the wrestling team and helps them to a few wins, Mike and Jackie are in their kitchen having a conversation. During the discussion, Kyle leaves the basement, where he is staying, followed by half of Mike's wrestling team. Mike and Jackie just watch the parade of teenagers follow their new leader, their new idol, out of the house.When the predictable moments come, late in the story, they seem like a small price to pay for all of the good moments before. They also seem a little necessary and are handled better than most other films would. All in all, these moments even seem a little acceptable.""Win Win"" is one of those independent gems you need to see in a theater, to show your support, and to help ensure more independent gems find their way to the multiplex.",5,"A ""Win Win""",1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,9022,"['Win', 'Win', 'new', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', 'Visitor', 'Station', 'Agent', 'charming',

Running out of money he decides to risk his practice by agreeing to become the guardian of a wealthy client.  When the clients grandson shows up to stay with him Mike takes him in and is amazed at his wrestling skills.  When his mom shows up the entire plan, and family, is thrown into turmoil.  This movie is very, very good.  The acting is excellent (with Giamatti that's kind of a given) and the writing is great.  The movie follows Mike and the decisions he makes that effect more then just him or his family.  Much like the movie ""Gone Baby Gone"" it deals with the scenario of if a kid is better living with a stranger then his own family.  At the same time this movie is very funny, moving and thought provoking and is a great choice to rent for the night.  The biggest problem that this movie has is that the family turmoil that is in this movie is overshadowed by ""The Beaver"" and the awesomeness of that movie.  Overall, a very, very good movie with great acting and heart. This movie will not dissapoint.Would I watch again? - I think I would.*Also try - Little Miss Sunshine & The Winning Season",4,A great movie about what is right for kids that is filled with great acting and heart.

1444893,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0057LOEGS,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","A comedy drama ""Win Win"" is a perfect vehicle for Paul Giamatti, who plays Mike Flaherty, a struggling New Jersey lawyer / high school wrestling coach. Mike, in need of money, becomes a guardian of Leo Poplar (Burt Young), a court-appointed client with early dementia for a monthly $1,500 check. Mike does a bad thing, and he too knows that, but somehow you can't hate him because of Giamatti's effective acting.Then a troubled teenager Kyle (Alex Shaffer) arrives. He is a grandson of Leo, and left his home in Ohio where his mother lives with her boyfriend. Kyle is also a talented wrestler, and joins Mike's team. This is the ""win-win"" situation for everyone until something happens to this precarious equilibrium.Directed with an assured hand by Tom McCarthy, writer/director of a critically acclaimed drama ""The Visitor"" (2007), ""Win Win"" continues to hold our attention with interesting characters until the final act, where things get a bit too conventional. The film's wrap-up part looks abrupt and more ""Hollywoodized"" than the director's previous work about illegal immigrants.This is not to say ""Win Win"" is a disappointment. Far from that. Well-acted and slickly made (Amy Ryan and Bobby Cannavale are stand-out), the film manages to entertain us without being overtly ""edgy.""

1444894,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0057LOEGS,Turfseer,"[1, 9]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Following in the footsteps of his earlier indie, 'The Visitor', Writer/Director Thomas McCarthy now proffers up a new unlikely tale, set in the wilds of suburban New Jersey. Paul Giamatti plays another lovable loser by the name of Mike Flaherty, a down on his luck attorney who suffers anxiety attacks due a downtown in his business. He shares an office with an accountant, Vigman, and has a friend, Terry, who's bitter after his wife leaves him for a contractor who's been repairing his home. Despite the fact that he's breaking his back trying to get new clients, Mike still has time to work as a part-time wrestling coach at the local high school, along with Vigman, and later Terry, who still has an interest in the sport as he used to be a below average wrestler as a teenager.The basic plot seems a bit confusing. I didn't understand why Mike agrees to assume the guardianship of part-dementia stricken Leo and then promptly puts him in a nursing home against his wishes. He could have kept his $1500 fee and simply allowed Leo to stay in his home with round-the-clock help (it's established that Leo is well off and can afford home care--in fact he already has help at the time Mike takes his case). Most of Mike's work as a guardian would have involved overseeing Leo's finances--not having to run over to the home all the time which is Mike's justification for putting him in the home in the first place. Leo did seem like an interesting character but Burt Young has little to do, playing a part that is clearly underwritten.Apparently, Mike's secretary's investigatory skills aren't very polished, as she's unable to find out any information about Leo's family. Lo and behold, Leo's missing grandson, Kyle, suddenly shows up on his grandfather's doorstep one fine day and he's a champion high school wrestling student to boot! Part of the problem here is that McCarthy can't decide whether this is a comedy or drama. The result really is an uneven hybrid. A good part of the Act 2 shenanigans are just that: shenanigans! The big joke is that the student wrestlers are completely inept and we're supposed to laugh at them, even after Kyle comes on board and restores a modicum of dignity to the team. Aside from Kyle, the next best player is Stemler (Kyle's buddy), who wins a match, not by pinning his opponent, but escaping his clutches, so that the clock runs out! The three coaches also happen to be thoroughly obnoxious in their fanatic love of the game; exhorting the hapless students through the use of choice expletives (and in the case of Mike) slapping Kyle in the face (at the boy's behest), in order to motivate him to greater heights on the gym floor.'Win, Win' becomes slightly more interesting at the midpoint, when Kyle's mother finally appears, lawyers up and demands to take Leo and Kyle back home with her as well as demanding Mike's $1500 guardianship commission. The way all this plays out is fairly predictable. Mike and his wife Jackie basically end up bonding with Kyle, despite the kid's chequered past which includes a juvenile rap for stealing a car. When Kyle finds out that Mike is ""just as bad as his mother"", after it's revealed that he put Leo in a nursing home against both the grandfather's and the court's wishes, Kyle disappears, resulting in a frantic search, initiated by Mike and Jackie. All's well that ends well when Kyle is found at Leo's place, a series of apologies are made by Mike and Jackie reassures the boy that he's loved by them. An even more sentimental (and hence happy ending) is effected when Kyle's drug addict mom changes her mind about allowing 'good kid' Kyle to remain with the Flahertys. The win-win proposition comes into play when Kyle's mom gets to keep the $1500 and Mike doesn't have to reveal to the court that he's guilty of fraud. Mike's only 'punishment' is that he's forced to work part-time as a bartender in order to make up for the money he's agreed to send to the drug addict mom.Giamatti does well in the role of Mike despite the fact that he's not a very sympathetic character. Even less sympathetic is Terry who has a chip on his shoulder after his wife has an affair with that contractor. I'm not sure what Vigman is doing in the script and newcomer Alex Shaffer (a former successful high school wrestler) feels like he needed quite a bit of coaching (for the acting part--not the wrestling) to play the part of Kyle. Only Amy Ryan really succeeds amongst the supporting players as she does well in depicting the skepticism (and later the acceptance) of the young interloper in her household.Like in his previous indie, 'The Visitor', McCarthy's characters tend to veer toward the melodramatic. There is a need for a slightly flawed hero but the antagonist is decidedly evil. In the end, Win Win, is pretty much a losing proposition, as it sacrifices verisimilitude for the easy happy ending, with characters who can't rise above their hearts of gold.",2,"Characters with

This is a really nice movie.  Probably not one you're going to want to watch over and over, but a very good story, well written, directed and acted.It is just a very nice evenings entertainment.Watch it, you will like it, then trade it in for credit towards another!",4,Really nice movie.,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,470,"['Paul', 'Giamatti', 'always', 'same', 'kind', 'character', 'Win', 'Win', 'step', 'out', 'mold', 'just', 'bit', 'not', 'totally', 'so', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'range', 'actor', 'really', 'nice', 'movie', 'Probably', 'not', 'one', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'watch', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'acted.It', 'just', 'very', 'nice', 'evenings', 'entertainment.Watch', 'will', 'like', 'then', 'trade', 'credit', 'towards']",N/A
1444898,AP3B615GM191G,B0057LOEGS,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Many films (for better or worse) portray an idealized form of life/drama to combat the current economic malaise.  ""Win Win"" is not that kind of film; instead choosing to revel in the struggles of day-to-day life and work through them.For a basic plot summary, ""Win Win"" sees Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) struggling to make a living for himself and his family.  His law practice is hemorrhaging funds, the bills are piling up at home, and his health is even failing due to the anxiety.  After becoming personally involved with a client (Burt Young), Mike ""inherits"" a son (Alex Shaffer) who provides a spark for his high school wrestling team and lifts his spirits.  That is, of course, until life intercedes once again.In better times, this might be the kind of movie that people would stay away from due to the fact that is is so down-to-earth in its portrayal of life's struggles.  In tough times, though, ""Win Win"" really resonates on a personal level.  The struggles of life are not black-and-white, but full of shades of grey and ambiguity.Also, while the film is well-acted as a general rule, Giamatti's performance is especially moving.  Giammatti is one of the great character actors of our time and never fails to shine on the big screen.  There's no one who can match his style of acting in terms of combining over-the-top physical/verbal acting with dramatic intensity.About the only thing that prevents this movie from being a true classic is that the climax doesn't necessarily live up to the build-up.  Don't worry, though, as the rich characters and believable circumstances are more than enough to provide compelling drama and entertainment.",5,A Movie For Our Times,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,1658,"['Many', 'films', 'better', 'worse', 'portray', 'idealized', 'form', 'life/drama', 'combat', 'current', 'economic', 'malaise', 'Win', 'Win', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'instead', 'choosing', 'revel', 'struggles', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'work', 'them.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Win', 'Win', 'Mike', 'Flaherty', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'struggling', 'make', 'living', 'family', 'law', 'practice', 'hemorrhaging', 'funds', 'bills', 'are', 'piling', 'up', 'home', 'health', 'even', 'failing', 'due', 'anxiety', 'becoming', 'personally', 'involved', 'client', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Mike', 'inherits', 'son', 'Alex', 'Shaffer', 'who', 'spark', 'high', 'school', 'wrestling', 'team', 'lifts', 'spirits', 'course', 'life', 'intercedes', 'once', 'again.In', 'better', 'times', 'might', 'be', 'kind', 'movie', 'people', 'would', 'stay', 'away', 'due', 'fact', 'so', 'down-to-earth', 'portrayal', 'life', 'struggles', 'tough', 'times', 'though', 'Win', 'Win', 'really', 'personal', 'level', 'struggles', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'black-and-white', 'full', 'shades', 'grey', 'ambiguity.Also', 'film', 'well-acted', 'general', 'rule', 'Giamatti', 'performance', 'especially', 'moving', 'Giammatti', 'one', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'time', 'never', 'shine', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'match', 'style', 'acting', 'terms', 'combining', 'over-the-top', 'physical/verbal', 'acting', 'dramatic', 'intensity.About', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'being', 'true', 'classic', 'climax', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'live', 'up', 'build-up', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'though', 'rich', 'characters', 'believable', 'circumstances', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'provide', 'compelling', 'drama', 'entertainment']",N/A
