Waylon is and always will be #1.  The people interviewed for this video were open and honest as was Waylon.  The dvd tells of his life and his struggle to enter the music industry.  And the fact that he never gave up.  He talks of Buddy Holly and the impact Buddy had on his life and the devastation he felt on Buddys death.  This is everything that anyone wants to know of Waylon.  Little bits of info about Jessie are there.  I only wish he would have had more about her and their life together.  There was no mention of The Highway Men.  But I guess if you want to buy this dvd, you want it because of Waylon, nothing else.The concert at the end is one in a million.  Truly Waylon.  At the end of the ""interview"" was a postscript. I must admit that is a bit of a tearjerker.  Knowing he is gone and reading what people say of him makes you realize that he was one in a million.  This is a must to have if you are a fan. I felt a sadness at the end of the interview knowing that the world lost a wonderful man.  But no matter what, Waylon will always be alive in the hearts of his fans.  I only wish I could give this video 10 stars, because 5 is not enough.",5,MAGNIFICENT DVD,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1278,"['could', 'rate', 'more', '5', 'would', 'watched', 'dvd', 'was', 'totally', 'mesmerized', 'biography', 'Waylon', 'Waylon', 'always', 'will', 'be', '1', 'people', 'interviewed', 'video', 'were', 'open', 'honest', 'was', 'Waylon', 'dvd', 'tells', 'life', 'struggle', 'enter', 'music', 'industry', 'fact', 'never', 'gave', 'up', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'impact', 'Buddy', 'had', 'life', 'devastation', 'felt', 'Buddys', 'death', 'everything', 'anyone', 'know', 'Waylon', 'Little', 'bits', 'info', 'Jessie', 'are', 'there', 'only', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'life', 'together', 'was', 'mention', 'Highway', 'Men', 'guess', 'want', 'buy', 'dvd', 'want', 'Waylon', 'nothing', 'else.The', 'concert', 'end', 'one', 'million', 'Truly', 'Waylon', 'end', 'interview', 'was', 'postscript', 'must', 'admit', 'bit', 'tearjerker', 'Knowing', 'gone', 'reading', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'realize', 'was', 'one', 'million', 'must', 'have', 'are', 'fan', 'felt', 'sadness', 'end', 'interview', 'knowing', 'world', 'lost', 'wonderful', 'man', 'matter', 'what', 'Waylon', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'alive', 'hearts', 'fans', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'video', '10', 'stars', '5', 'not', 'enough']",N/A
