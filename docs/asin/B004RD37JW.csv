1426751,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B004RD37JW,Amanda Richards,"[6, 7]","Based, I believe, on the forgettable ""Day After Tomorrow"", this movie proves to be even more forgettable.  Pushing the limits of bad acting, grammar school CGI, clich&eacute;s and atrocious dialogue, the movie almost freezes time as it plods along interminably to the hackneyed climax.If the following lines were omitted, the movie would have been about 30 minutes shorter:1. Bill/Dad! Get us out of here!!!!2. There's no signal - I can't get through3. Are you all right?4. Where's the glacier?5. We're going to New York/Manhattan - our daughter's there.6. We need to find another route.In a nutshell:1. Lots of volcanoes start erupting up north, releasing the Godzilla of all glaciers which travels at 200mph and starts wiping out the eastern seaboard, one state at a time.2. The military reacts by alternately trying to shoot it down or blow it up.3. One family starts driving/flying, facing insurmountable obstacles to rescue their daughter in New York while outrunning the said 200mph glacier.4. Need I say more?Don't watch this even if it was the only movie available and the world was going to end tomorrow.Amanda Richards, July 10, 2011",1,Get me out of here!!,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,1143,"['Based', 'believe', 'forgettable', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'movie', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'forgettable', 'Pushing', 'limits', 'bad', 'acting', 'grammar', 'school', 'CGI', 'clich', 'eacute', 'atrocious', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'almost', 'freezes', 'time', 'along', 'interminably', 'hackneyed', 'climax.If', 'following', 'lines', 'were', 'omitted', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', '30', 'minutes', 'shorter:1', 'Bill/Dad', 'Get', 'here', '2', 'signal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'through3', 'Are', 'right', '4', 'Where', 'glacier', '5', ""'re"", 'going', 'New', 'York/Manhattan', 'daughter', 'there.6', 'need', 'find', 'route.In', 'nutshell:1', 'Lots', 'volcanoes', 'start', 'erupting', 'up', 'north', 'releasing', 'Godzilla', 'glaciers', 'travels', '200mph', 'starts', 'wiping', 'eastern', 'seaboard', 'one', 'state', 'time.2', 'military', 'reacts', 'alternately', 'trying', 'shoot', 'down', 'blow', 'up.3', 'One', 'family', 'driving/flying', 'facing', 'insurmountable', 'obstacles', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'New', 'York', 'outrunning', 'said', '200mph', 'glacier.4', 'Need', 'say', 'more', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'available', 'world', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'tomorrow.Amanda', 'Richards', 'July', '10', '2011']",2012: Ice Age

A runway glacier coming down from Greenland and wiping out all the states up in New England? And the so called special effects look like something some second grade kids did by cut and paste photos on each other. Definitely a low budget movie, VERY low budget. Besides the lame ""special effects"" a lot of the ""sets"" used look like they were used by the same second grader's for stage sets for the schools no-talent show.One part of it just really bugs me. The main family, mom dad & boy, are trying to get to New York to get daughter. They have a car wreck and role their car. They find an abandoned van and decide to barrow it. Who ever left the van also left a big note taped over the steering wheel. It has great big ""!"" on it and says something about turning the key to,,, something. I never did get to read all of it. These people are in this Van several hours, drive for several miles, and nobody sees the note on the steering wheel!From the lame acting to the cheesy not so special special effects to the point of the movie, getting away from a runaway glacier, a giant wall of ice twice as high as the New York skyline moving at something like a 100 miles an hour, with the occasional giant chunks of ice as big as semi trailers falling out of the sky! Come on people! A ""Science Fiction"" movie, key word there ""Science"" is supposed to have something at least close to scientific principals. Something at least next door to the realm of reality &/or plausibility. You know, like for a glacier to move it has to be ""down hill"". It cant just take off cross country, going up and over mountains, travel a couple thousand miles at a 100 miles an hour!If they weren't trying so hard to act like it was real, it would make a pretty good satire comedy.",1,The worst movie I've ever seen,1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,1864,"['down', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'basis', 'movie', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'start', 'runway', 'glacier', 'coming', 'down', 'Greenland', 'wiping', 'out', 'states', 'up', 'New', 'England', 'so', 'called', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'something', 'second', 'grade', 'kids', 'did', 'cut', 'paste', 'photos', 'other', 'Definitely', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'VERY', 'low', 'budget', 'lame', 'special', 'effects', 'lot', 'sets', 'used', 'look', 'were', 'used', 'same', 'second', 'grader', 'stage', 'sets', 'schools', 'no-talent', 'show.One', 'part', 'just', 'really', 'bugs', 'main', 'family', 'mom', 'dad', 'boy', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'New', 'York', 'get', 'daughter', 'have', 'car', 'wreck', 'role', 'car', 'find', 'abandoned', 'van', 'decide', 'barrow', 'Who', 'ever', 'left', 'van', 'also', 'left', 'big', 'note', 'taped', 'steering', 'wheel', 'great', 'big', 'something', 'turning', 'key', 'something', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'read', 'people', 'are', 'Van', 'several', 'hours', 'drive', 'several', 'miles', 'nobody', 'note', 'steering', 'wheel', 'lame', 'acting', 'cheesy', 'not', 'so', 'special', 'special', 'effects', 'point', 'movie', 'getting', 'away', 'runaway', 'glacier', 'giant', 'wall', 'ice', 'twice', 'as', 'high', 'New', 'York', 'skyline', 'moving', 'something', '100', 'miles', 'hour', 'occasional', 'giant', 'chunks', 'ice', 'as', 'big', 'semi', 'trailers', 'falling', 'sky', 'Come', 'people', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'movie', 'key', 'word', 'Science', 'supposed', 'have', 'something', 'least', 'close', 'scientific', 'principals', 'Something', 'least', 'next', 'door', 'realm', 'reality', '/or', 'plausibility', 'know', 'glacier', 'move', 'be', 'down', 'hill', 'cant', 'just', 'take', 'off', 'cross', 'country', 'going', 'up', 'mountains', 'travel', 'couple', 'thousand', 'miles', '100', 'miles', 'hour', 'were', ""n't"", 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'act', 'was', 'real', 'would', 'make', 'pretty', 'good', 'satire', 'comedy']",2012: Ice Age
1426755,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B004RD37JW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","No one loves The Asylum and their ever-growing crop of cheap B-movies more than I do, but there's really no defense that I or anyone else could possibly offer for 2012: Ice Age.  Not only is this the worst film The Asylum has ever released, it's easily the worst disaster movie I've ever seen.  The storyline is laughably absurd, the acting is embarrassingly bad, and the special effects may as well have been done by a class of fifth-graders.  This movie is so bad that you can't even enjoy its mediocrity - rather than laugh at it, you just want to put it out of its misery.Remember how air traffic in Europe was brought to a standstill by the atmospheric effects of volcanic explosions in Iceland a while back?  Well, imagine what would happen if every volcano in Iceland erupted all at once.  Now stop imagining because you've already created a better movie in your head than what you're going to see in 2012: Ice Age.  Here, all those volcanic explosions send the mother of all glaciers hurtling down the eastern seaboard of North America.  Canada apparently offers no opposition because the glacier is bearing down on New England within about ten minutes (which is strange since we later learn the glacier is moving at a speed of 200 mph).  Patrick Labyorteaux plays (badly) Bill Hart, a big, doughy scientist of some sort who grabs his wife and incredibly wussy son and embarks on a desperate race to get out of Maine and get to his daughter in New York before the glacier destroys the Big Apple.  Most of the ""action"" takes place inside the vehicles the Harts employ on their journey to New York.  On many occasions, all kinds of CGI hell is taking place outside, sending their vehicle hurtling and sliding around dropping glacier chunks in a hurricane of snow and wind - but you wouldn't know it from the constantly steady interior shots.  Even more strangely, a number of exterior shots then show the vehicle traveling down a completely clear street, with the only signs of winter weather being some scraped-off snow on the sides of the road.  Of course, America isn't taking this new Ice Age lying down.  Basically declaring war on the glacier, the Air Force tries to bomb the hell out of the ice floe with jets - and, apparently in an effort to confuse the glacier, these jets are specially designed to magically morph between F-15s, F-16s, F/A-18 Hornets, and F-22 Raptors; some of them even become invisible, as the number of visible jets in formation constantly changes from one shot to the next.2012: Ice Age seemingly completes The Asylum's disastrous 2012 trilogy, following in the footsteps of 2012: Doomsday and 2012: Supernova, two movies almost as unwatchable and incompetently made as this one.  We can only hope that The Asylum will now get back to the business of giving us what we want: pop icons of the 1980s fighting giant reptiles and aquatic monsters.",1,The biggest joke of a disaster movie I've ever seen,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,2881,"['one', 'Asylum', 'ever-growing', 'crop', 'cheap', 'B-movies', 'more', 'do', 'really', 'defense', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'possibly', 'offer', '2012', 'Ice', 'Age', 'Not', 'only', 'worst', 'film', 'Asylum', 'ever', 'released', 'easily', 'worst', 'disaster', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'storyline', 'laughably', 'absurd', 'acting', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'class', 'fifth-graders', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'enjoy', 'mediocrity', 'rather', 'laugh', 'just', 'want', 'put', 'misery.Remember', 'how', 'air', 'traffic', 'Europe', 'was', 'brought', 'standstill', 'atmospheric', 'effects', 'volcanic', 'explosions', 'Iceland', 'while', 'back', 'Well', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'volcano', 'Iceland', 'erupted', 'once', 'Now', 'stop', 'imagining', ""'ve"", 'already', 'created', 'better', 'movie', 'head', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', '2012', 'Ice', 'Age', 'Here', 'volcanic', 'explosions', 'send', 'mother', 'glaciers', 'hurtling', 'down', 'eastern', 'seaboard', 'North', 'America', 'Canada', 'apparently', 'opposition', 'glacier', 'bearing', 'down', 'New', 'England', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'strange', 'later', 'learn', 'glacier', 'moving', 'speed', '200', 'mph', 'Patrick', 'Labyorteaux', 'plays', 'badly', 'Bill', 'Hart', 'big', 'doughy', 'scientist', 'sort', 'who', 'grabs', 'wife', 'incredibly', 'wussy', 'son', 'embarks', 'desperate', 'race', 'get', 'Maine', 'get', 'daughter', 'New', 'York', 'glacier', 'Big', 'Apple', 'Most', 'action', 'place', 'vehicles', 'Harts', 'employ', 'journey', 'New', 'York', 'many', 'occasions', 'kinds', 'CGI', 'hell', 'taking', 'place', 'sending', 'vehicle', 'hurtling', 'sliding', 'around', 'dropping', 'glacier', 'chunks', 'hurricane', 'snow', 'wind', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'constantly', 'steady', 'interior', 'shots', 'Even', 'more', 'strangely', 'number', 'exterior', 'shots', 'then', 'show', 'vehicle', 'traveling', 'down', 'completely', 'clear', 'street', 'only', 'signs', 'winter', 'weather', 'being', 'scraped-off', 'snow', 'sides', 'road', 'course', 'America', ""n't"", 'taking', 'new', 'Ice', 'Age', 'lying', 'down', 'Basically', 'declaring', 'war', 'glacier', 'Air', 'Force', 'bomb', 'hell', 'ice', 'floe', 'jets', 'apparently', 'effort', 'confuse', 'glacier', 'jets', 'are', 'specially', 'designed', 'magically', 'morph', 'F-15s', 'F-16s', 'F/A-18', 'Hornets', 'F-22', 'Raptors', 'even', 'become', 'invisible', 'number', 'visible', 'jets', 'formation', 'constantly', 'one', 'shot', 'next.2012', 'Ice', 'Age', 'seemingly', 'Asylum', 'disastrous', '2012', 'trilogy', 'following', 'footsteps', '2012', 'Doomsday', '2012', 'Supernova', 'two', 'movies', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'incompetently', 'made', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Asylum', 'will', 'now', 'get', 'back', 'business', 'giving', 'what', 'want', 'pop', 'icons', '1980s', 'fighting', 'giant', 'reptiles', 'aquatic', 'monsters']",2012: Ice Age

His daughter is already out of the car and gone by the time he hears this so he has no choice, he has to take his family to New York. It is a race against time as the two hundred mile long glacier is moving at an insane speed freezing everything along the way.Writers Paul Sinor and Victoria Dadi who wrote &#8220;Airline Disaster&#8221; together in my opinion wrote a cool little B flick. Of course there are things that don&#8217;t make sense [I will leave that to you to find out] but that is the beauty of these kinds of films. Directed by first time [and one time it seems right now] director Travis Fort the film moves along at a great pace as I was never bored I stayed entertained the entire time.

Combined with the very definitions of ham-fisted, wooden, pathetic overacting ever put on screen. The sheer ineptitude displayed is almost beyond words to describe. Quite honestly and without a bit of sarcasm: I've seen elementary kids in their school plays execute better - and they were performing in construction paper and tape!The only face of note would be Patrick Labyorteaux, a veteran of television's JAG.

So my expectations of 2012 ICE AGE weren't exactly high, but I didn't think it could be this bad...this awful!The movie uses the 2012 in its title to merely cash in on its blockbuster namesake.  Thankfully, there's little technological babbling probably because the writers didn't want to do any deep research.  Scenes fall upon each other with reckless abandon.  Cessna plane flies just as fast as jet bombers.  In Boston human beings freeze, but not anywhere else.  Teens seek shelter in a help unit and then flee the shelter to seek refuge in an abandoned building a few doors down.  Characters come and go.  Snow-covered roads suddenly clear and cars appear out of nowhere.  FX are really really bad.  I have never seen snow so blatantly fake--and obtrusive.But worst of all is Patrick Laboryteux's dismal and dyspeptic acting.  Our hero father's expression never changes.  No change in emotion at any time.  His fear looks like his happy.  His aloof demeanor may have worked on JAG, but his presence in ICE AGE sinks any chance of heroism.  Probably the worst actor in any disaster film ever!  Sheilah McCullough's mother is equally abysmal.
