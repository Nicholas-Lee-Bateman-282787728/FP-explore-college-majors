771579,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B0000BWVND,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[0, 0]","I have very mixed feelings about this film. I definitely feel it was worth the time expended in viewing it, but I am not comfortable with thenew type of documentary film this represents. Traditionally, documentaries and biographies of this type would show photographs and archivefilms regarding the subject accompanyed by interviews with people knowledgable about it.  In recent years the trend has been to include actorsportraing the subject and showing reenactments of the events the person was involved in. Somehow, I feel this is something of a cheapeningof the value of the information being presented, with the belief that if somehow people are not ""entertained"" with dramatic action while viewing the film, they willnot absorb the information being conveyed. I am not convinced this is necessary.  Had a documentary of the old style been made regard Lawrence,the film could have been half the length and even more information could have been presented. As it was, the interviews given in the filmgive a very partial and one-sided view of the historical consequences of Lawrence's actions and those of British and French imperialists whotook control of the former Ottoman territories after the First World War.I think the problem can be summarized by the statements of one of the interviewees who states something to the effect ""all the problems the Arab world hassuffered from to this day are due to the betrayal of the Arabs by Lawrence and the British government"".  Another interviewee states thatthe Arabs had been expecting a democratic and progressive state would be set up by Prince Feisal in Damascus but that this was frustratedby the British who instead of setting up an independent Arab Kingdom centered in Damascus, handed it over to the French.Is this indeed the case?  There are is also the  statement by an interviewee that the Balfour Declaration which recognized Jewish-Zionists rights in Palestinewas somehow illegitimate which many people don't agree with.The fact is that most of the fighting and dying that was done in the war with the Ottoman Turks was not carried out by the Arab Revolt. Certainlythe Arab revolt made an important contribution but the bulk of the sacrifice was made by British Troops whose war cemetaries are scattered throughthe area. The fact of the matter is that MOST Arabs, while not particularly not liking their Ottoman rulers, still supported them in their waragainst Britain and France. The Ottomans had, after all, the Caliph, who was recognized as the leader of world Islam.  It has been argued thatSherif Hussein, father of Prince Feisal was the nominal head of the revolt, had actually negotiated with the Ottomans about his supportingthem instead, but the British out-bid them and so he decided to become an Arab nationalist instead.Regarding the claim that had Prince Feisal set up his Kingdom in Damascus, a wonderful, united, peacful prosperous, democratic Arab world wouldhave emerged, it can be seen that it was fanicful at best. Today there is an independent Arab state in Syria based in Damascus and it istearing itself apart with fratricidal warfare. There is no no doubt that had Feisal's kingdom indeed been set up, the centrifugal religious and politicalforces that everyone can see today would have broken that kingdom up in short order, just as Nasser's attempt to set up a ""United Arab Republic""by merging Egypt and Syria in the late 1950's fell apart after only three years.What those interviewed in the film convey is the ""Arab as victim"" narrative.  By calling Britain's backtracking on its promises to the Arabs as ""the greatestbetrayal in history"" as one person in the film claims or, as was said above, that this was the cause of all the Arab's problems down to this day,shows a denial of one's own responsibility for one's situation in life.  The fact is that anyone with a little sense of history could see thatalthough Britain did take control over Palestine and Iraq after World War I, their control WOULD NOT LAST.  Already there was great agitationin India for independence which was known about all around the world, and once India was freed, the rest of the British Empire would go as well.Instead of taking what was offered...quasi-independent states in Iraq and Transjordan and the offer of two Arab states in Palestine-Transjordan,there was rejectionism and nursing of grievances.  Britain left the Middle sixty years ago. France gave independence to Lebanon and Syria alreadyin 1944.  The failure of these countries can not be attributed to what Lawrence and the British did almost a century ago. Germany and Japan underwenta far more wrenching upheaval with their defeats in the Second World War yet they have built successful countries since then. South Korea, at the endof the Korean War in 1953 had the same per-captia Gross National Product at Egypt at the time, yet today, South Korea's is now EIGHT times that ofEgypt. How does the actions of Lawarence and the British of a century ago explain that?  This film merely reinforces the view that all the problemsthe Middle East faces are someone else's fault and the Arab world will not come out of the doldrums they are in until new voices arise fromamongs their own population for their people to finally take responsibility and roll up their shirt-sleeves and go to work to builda more successful society.One more point that is lacking in the film is that fact that it is not mentioned that Lawrence was pro-Zionist and supported the creation ofa Jewish state in Palestine. He certainly viewed the Jews as having rights in Palestine no less than the Arabs, unlike what one of the interviewsclaims in the film, and he saw no contradition in supporting both Jewish and Arab rights.  The film itself mentions the meeting between Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann and Prince Feisal and how Feisal initiallyexpressed support for Zionist aspirations.  Tragically, the Arab world views the Arab-Israeli relations as a zero-sum game.Peace will not arrive until this view is radically changed, but this will not happen until the Arabstake responsibility for their situation, as was stated above.",3,Are T.

771580,ABP0RCZCVMRRG,B0000BWVND,"J. DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[30, 72]","If you know something about the real history of the Middle East, this DVD will supplement it with some interesting old pics of Lawrence and scenes from the region.  But the authentic old movies and pics of Lawrence are few, recycled too often, and the movie with Peter O'Toole gives a much better reproduction of the main events.  Lawrence's homosexual affair with a young Arab man is exposed, and he comes off as a brilliant but dysfunctional human who got along better in a society where women were made invisible. It also misportrays the Arabs as having a major role in the military defeat of the Turks when in fact their roles were episodic at best, with the major credit due to Allenby, save for the capture of Al Aqabah, which was brilliant.  The Arab army of Faisal never amounted to more than around 1,000 Bedouins with maybe 3,000 Ottoman former prisoners who joined them, and was plagued by chronic tribal feuding and desertions en-mass at critical times. They were held together into an alliance only by massive quantities of British gold, which Lawrence was regularly supplied with to buy their loyalty. If the Turks had offered the gold, they would have just as easily gone with them. The O'Toole movie about Lawrence more accurately shows this side of things.  Not a word is mentioned about these facts in the PBS DVD ""documentary"" however, nor that one major complaint of the puritanical Arabian warriors against the Turks was their more secular nature -- even before Attaturk, they were ""going West"". Nor that much of the fight also was about having ""my King"" instead of ""your King"" as the Big Boss.  The Arabs simply wanted to replace the Ottomans, but retain the same old gigantic territory and method of authoritarian rule.  The British did promise a lot to many different parties in the Middle East, being exceedingly desperate to save Europe from the scheming Kaiser, whose plans for domination had killed millions on the Western Front. But the Arabs eventually got nearly everything they wanted, though (thank goodness) not the single giant Arab State flying the banner of Islam.  The whole DVD seems to pivot upon what they did not get - Israel - and the Arab ""historians"" interviewed use the story of Lawrence as yet another weapon against Israel.  No mention is made of the large populations of Jews in Palestine and Baghdad at the time, nor of Arab Christians, nor how they also fought against and suffered badly under the Turks and so were demanding some justice and autonomy in their regions, nor any of the other competing interests within the region which the authors of the Treaty of Versilles had to cope with.  The only thing that mattered to the Arabs, and to Lawrence also it appears, and to the producer of this flick was, that the Arabs didn't get EVERYTHING. So small historical facts like the quick Arab rejection of the Peel Commission offer by the British -- which was to give nearly all of Palestine to Arabs, to be run by Arabs under presumably Muslim Law, restricting Jewish immigration totally, but allowing the existing Jews to remain living there -- are never mentioned. The fact is, the Arab leaders were tribal Kings with no interest in democracy or humanistic social freedoms or justice.  The British and French in Europe knew this, but Lawrence, so captivated by sand dunes and his young male lover, was blind as a bat, and like the authors of this film, could not see that after the throwing out of the autocratic Turks, many people in Palestine - notably the Jews, Christian Arabs and those influenced by French culture, simply did not want to live under some new King or dictator, with a continuance of Mullahs lording over everyone, maintaining dhimminitude and grinding women down into the dirt.  This PBS propaganda is not recommended for the historically naive, or for children, unless you want to glorify Lawrence's blindness and lifestyle, and once again to misportray Western democratic influences as ""bad"".

771581,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0000BWVND,mirasreviews,"[39, 43]","This PBS documentary uses old newsreels, many modern reenactments, and interviews with T.E. Lawrence's biographers and with British and Arab historians to tell the true story behind the legend of Lawrence of Arabia. We learn of Lawrence's background and the archeological interests that first took him to the Middle East when he was 20 years old. Then, as World War I raged in Europe, Lawrence returned to the Middle East, where his knowledge of the region's culture and language would help him advance British efforts against Turkey, which by that time had allied itself with Germany. Lawrence became instrumental in securing British support for the Arab Revolt against the Turks and served as the Revolt's strategic and technical advisor and one of its soldiers in arms. It was Lawrence who conveyed to the Arabs Great Britain's promise of self-rule in exchange for their efforts in driving the Ottoman Empire from the Middle East. With Great Britain's assistance, the Arab Revolt was successful. But Britain had brokered the Sykes-Picot Agreement with France behind the backs of its Arab allies, which would place the region under British and French mandates. Britain would later violate its promise to the Arabs again with the Balfour Declaration. T.E. Lawrence, back in Britain after the War,  did all he could to convince the powers that be to award the Arabs independence as promised, but succeeded only halfway. He spent his last years trying to make himself anonymous.&quot;Lawrence of Arabia: The Battle for the Arab World&quot; presents both Arab and British understandings of Lawrence's role in the formation of the modern Middle East. It asserts that Britain's betrayal of the Arabs after World War I and its subsequent carving up of the region for its own convenience is at the root of many of the Middle East's problems today. Historians of both cultures are in agreement on this point, and on most points. And it is interesting to note the similarities between the political situation in the Middle East today and that of nearly a century ago. Although the actions of the colonial powers undoubtedly created longstanding problems in the region and engendered hostility toward Western nations, the Arab ideal of a single unified Arab nation was probably a pipe dream. Arab factions had issues between themselves that would have made an economically and politically unified Arab nation the stuff of utopian fantasy. Still, this documentary is a good easy-to-digest primer on what shaped the Middle East's political boundaries and why. And it's an interesting story of a fascinating but enigmatic man, Lawrence of Arabia, a legend in his own lifetime and in ours. Recommended viewing for those interested in understanding some of the background of the current crises in the Middle East.The DVD: There is a very short &quot;making of&quot; documentary that is shown in widescreen but appears to have been filmed full screen, so the images look slightly stretched.

They sit there with their head garb on and mumble away while we get a voice-over..Where did they get these two jokers from? How much did they get paid to sit there? Another let down is the lack of actual film footage of T.E. Lawrence. It does exist and more of it should have been put in. Instead we get some modern day actor who looks like Lawrence riding along on a camel and with many closeups of his face as he ponders his situation. I'd much rather watch Peter O'Toole. Anyway, if your interested in the real facts of Lawrence Of Arabia, suggest you read some of the excellent web sites on the subject. I sat (fell asleep) through this only to learn that Lawrence was an excellent military leader who told the Arabs anything they wanted to hear as long as it benefited Britain in their quest to control Arabia. Too much of the program is devoted to Lawrence being a homosexual. His sexuality is a  curiosity to many I suppose but why go on and on about it? Unfortunately as far as television documentaries on Lawrence Of Arabia go, apparantly there is only this one. After seeing this I will stick to watching the excellent movies about him..",2,Nothing New Here.,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,1623,"['poorly', 'produced', 'program', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'low', 'budget', ""'m"", 'very', 'surprised', 'PBS', 'would', 'put', 'name', 'shoddy', 'piece', 'work', 'seeing', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'where', 'are', 'need', 'do', 'proper', 'program', 'Lawrence', 'What', 'really', 'amused', 'was', 'two', 'phoney', 'Tribal', 'Historians', 'had', 'commenting', 'Lawrence', 'activities', '80', 'years', 'ago', 'sit', 'there', 'head', 'garb', 'mumble', 'away', 'get', 'voice-over..Where', 'did', 'get', 'two', 'jokers', 'How', 'much', 'did', 'get', 'paid', 'sit', 'there', 'let', 'down', 'lack', 'actual', 'film', 'footage', 'T.E', 'Lawrence', 'exist', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'Instead', 'get', 'modern', 'day', 'actor', 'who', 'Lawrence', 'riding', 'along', 'camel', 'many', 'closeups', 'face', 'situation', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'watch', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Anyway', 'interested', 'real', 'facts', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'suggest', 'read', 'excellent', 'web', 'sites', 'subject', 'sat', 'fell', 'asleep', 'only', 'learn', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'excellent', 'military', 'leader', 'who', 'told', 'Arabs', 'anything', 'wanted', 'hear', 'as', 'long', 'benefited', 'Britain', 'quest', 'control', 'Arabia', 'Too', 'much', 'program', 'devoted', 'Lawrence', 'being', 'homosexual', 'sexuality', 'curiosity', 'many', 'suppose', 'why', 'go', 'Unfortunately', 'as', 'far', 'television', 'documentaries', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'go', 'apparantly', 'only', 'one', 'seeing', 'will', 'stick', 'watching', 'excellent', 'movies', 'him..']",N/A
