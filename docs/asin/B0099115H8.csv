I've been lifting weights and doing step aerobics since my 20s, and don't have a New Age, holistic bone in my body -- but wanted some form of exercise that's a little less strenuous.  So I've tried about a dozen yoga videos, all of which were described as &#34;non-mystical&#34; and &#34;muscle toning and strengthening&#34; -- and they were all far too slow, sleepy and excruciatingly boring for me.  &#34;Lie on your back, close your eyes, relax and BREATHE...&#34; for 5 minutes.  Then &#34;Open your eyes, relax and BREATHE....&#34; for another 5 minutes.  And people kid themselves that this is &#34;exercise&#34;?Well, Chrissy Carter's video is the first one I didn't give up on after 10 minutes.  First of all, the scenery and music are very nice.  Chrissy is pleasant and friendly, but very matter-of-fact and non-mystical.  Her instructions are very clear (&#34;Try to feel like you're pulling the floor towards you&#34;).  And -- most importantly to me -- the video moves at a good clip.  If anything, she goes a little TOO fast, as others have said!  Definitely not a lot of &#34;breathe deeeeply and relaaaaax.&#34;  (And I know you yoga purists are gonna slam me for saying that.)  But the three routines here (about 15 min. each) are nice, quick, do-able intros to yoga moves.  They would work very well as early-morning-wake-up-and- stretch-out-the-kinks routines, to help with sciatica or other back problems, or as a cool-down/stretch after a more strenuous workout.  And you definitely get some back and shoulder strengthening here.  One small criticism I have is that, even though some of the poses are challenging, she doesn't give you a lot of modifications for beginners.  Planks and &#34;Downward Dogs&#34; are quite hard if you're 50+ and out of shape.  But again, I am pleased with this purchase and will use it fairly often.The only reason I subtracted one star is not Chrissy's fault.  It is because the DVD starts with at least 10 minutes of commercials for other Gaiam videos, which you cannot fast-forward through.  REALLY annoying!  So I pop in the dvd BEFORE I change into my yoga duds.",4,A good place to start with yoga,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,2317,"['First', 'would', 'describe', 'yoga-hater', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'trying', 'like', 'yoga', 'EVERYONE', 'constantly', 'especially', ""'m"", '51', 'have', 'back', 'problems', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lifting', 'weights', 'doing', 'step', 'aerobics', '20s', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'New', 'Age', 'holistic', 'bone', 'body', 'wanted', 'form', 'exercise', 'little', 'less', 'strenuous', 'So', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'dozen', 'yoga', 'videos', 'were', 'described', '34', 'non-mystical', '34', '34', 'muscle', 'toning', 'strengthening', '34', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'slow', 'sleepy', 'excruciatingly', 'boring', '34', 'Lie', 'back', 'close', 'eyes', 'relax', 'BREATHE', '34', '5', 'minutes', 'Then', '34', 'Open', 'eyes', 'relax', 'BREATHE', '34', '5', 'minutes', 'people', 'kid', '34', 'exercise', '34', 'Well', 'Chrissy', 'Carter', 'video', 'first', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', '10', 'minutes', 'First', 'all', 'scenery', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'Chrissy', 'pleasant', 'friendly', 'very', 'matter-of-fact', 'non-mystical', 'instructions', 'are', 'very', 'clear', '34', 'Try', 'feel', ""'re"", 'pulling', 'floor', '34', 'most', 'importantly', 'video', 'good', 'clip', 'anything', 'little', 'TOO', 'fast', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'Definitely', 'not', 'lot', '34', 'deeeeply', 'relaaaaax.', '34', 'know', 'yoga', 'purists', 'are', 'gon', 'slam', 'saying', 'three', 'routines', 'here', '15', 'min', 'are', 'nice', 'quick', 'do-able', 'intros', 'yoga', 'moves', 'would', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'early-morning-wake-up-and-', 'stretch-out-the-kinks', 'routines', 'help', 'sciatica', 'other', 'back', 'problems', 'cool-down/stretch', 'more', 'strenuous', 'workout', 'definitely', 'get', 'back', 'shoulder', 'strengthening', 'here', 'One', 'small', 'criticism', 'have', 'even', 'poses', 'are', 'challenging', ""n't"", 'give', 'lot', 'modifications', 'beginners', 'Planks', '34', 'Downward', 'Dogs', '34', 'are', 'quite', 'hard', ""'re"", '50+', 'shape', 'again', 'am', 'pleased', 'purchase', 'will', 'use', 'fairly', 'only', 'reason', 'subtracted', 'one', 'star', 'not', 'Chrissy', 'fault', 'DVD', 'least', '10', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'other', 'Gaiam', 'videos', 'can', 'not', 'fast-forward', 'REALLY', 'annoying', 'So', 'pop', 'dvd', 'change', 'yoga', 'duds']",Beginning Yoga with Chrissy Carter
