Even the supporting and ancillary characters are strong - and most important - multidimensional. There are sympathetic, ordinary whites trying to make a living and interacting as equals to their native friends. There is a conflicted native fooled by a duplicitous priest.The story is highly suspenseful, and will make you angry. The abuses it portrays really happened (and not just to native people either). It also has a message patience and gentleness, and it's ultimate portrayal of healing is a blessing.Though the stories are completely different, it has a similar feel to ""Grand Torino"" in its development of multi-dimensional characters coming to terms and learning universal truths.The friendships, family struggles, and disdainful gov. bureaucracies are things to which we can all relate. Healing doesn't come from revenge and hate -- it comes from truth. That's the message I got strongly from this gem of a film.

1375944,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B003Y7F1OG,Carlisle Wheeling,"[2, 2]","This movie is a very powerful look at 20th century atrocities experienced by Native Americans at the hands of the Catholic Church and the US government.  Other religious groups were horrible to them as well, as is recorded in 1800s history, but this portrayal is particularly more ruthless and disturbing than what I'd previously read.  I wonder what would happen if the tables were turned and it happened to my own race instead.  Would there be such a long wait for justice?Adam Beach is great as Johnny Goodfeather, the reservation police officer who gets little cooperation from the jerk who--I honestly have to admit--gets what he deserves a little later down the road.  His girlfriend Rae is beginning to have visions of the widescale abuses and murders of her mother and classmates at the hands of brutal Catholic nuns and priests at a now dilapidated school that is full of the ghosts of its victims.  The government and the priest who has Rae's aunt Apple brainwashed will do anything to cover up the troubling history of their acts, so they try to silence her in a mental hospital as they did with her mother.  Fortunately, some people won't let it rest, and the message comes across loud and clear.Maybe some things were a bit far fetched (Tantoo Cardinal's Aunt Apple made me want to scream, because I don't see what listening to the Father was going to gain her in the first place) but, all in all, this movie will wake you up to the horrors of how our nation's proclamation that all men are created equal is twisted to fit the Orwellian quote from Animal Farm:  All [people] are equal, but some [people] are more equal than others.  This has been true with other ethnic groups in our society as well, as we all know, and any education to help change things is a definite plus.  The movie comes off as a supernatural thriller, but this is effective as well, because justice is served to one of our other major antagonists at their hands.  Catch this one if you can, spread the word, and discuss it.  Better yet, use this as a springboard to be more fully educated in the injustices people encounter every day; maybe it isn't the absolute ideal according to some of the reviews here, but it's a really good place to start.",5,"Kill the Indian; Save the Man.

1375945,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B003Y7F1OG,CGScammell,"[12, 12]","This movie, inspired by true events concerning the forced assimilation of Native American children to Christian education and culture, is a well-done film produced on the Fond du Lac reservation of northern Minnesota.  Written and acted by Gloriana Lightning as Rain, the teacher-fiance to Adam Beach, I found the first redeeming value the fact that the Indians in this film aren't the stereotypical drunkards, villains or ignorami.  This movie is more about the psychological trauma these Indian children (now adults) experienced at the hands of white Christian educators.The big theme here is the clash between two cultures:  that of the white culture and that of the Native culture.  The Catholic church on this reservation has been a brutal church that has a history of abusing its children, forcing it to learn white culture and penalizing the children if they spoke or practiced their culture.  Those who died from the torture were quietly buried in the nearby woods.Adam Beach plays John Goodfeather, the tribal cop who oversees law enforcement on the reservation and who accompanies Luke Patterson, a white geologist coming to the reservation to check out a weak but unusual earthquake on the east side of the rez.  Goodfeather is also the fiancee to Rae (Gloria Lightning) who is also having similar visions of abused children much like her own mother had, and for which her own mother was hospitalized for schizophrenia and heavily medicated.  She fears she will end up like her own mother.  Her care and concern for her mother keeps her emotionally bonded to the reservation and her mother.Things start getting intense when the officer at Land Trust, Mark Anderson, the evil white guy, is found hanging dead from a tree crucifiction style.  It's not clear who murdered him, but his murder is evidence there are ghosts in the woods and around the old school grounds that aren't too happy with what has happened here to its own children.  They are fighting back the planned proposal to turn the abandoned school ground into a high-profit resort area, and it is this proposal that is a big campaign issue in the upcoming election.I won't reveal too much of this movie.  This isn't a stereotypical American Indian movie of evil white guy versus innocent Indian.  This is more of an admission of prior abuses by white culture on the native spirituality and how the native culture is slowly taking back the rights to its own land.  Perhaps some of the abuses may seem farfetched, however, remember this is a compilation of many stories from many tribes who all experienced the ""Kill the Indian, spare the man"" mentality that was so prevalent from the 1880s through the 1920s.  The abuses depicted here, which are everything from rape to mental torture, are not unique to the Catholic church, but of all white churches that were taking over the education of native Indian children.The cinematography is beautiful, the acting solid, and the accompanying soundtrack beautiful.  I especially liked the song ""Someone call an Angel Down"" as performed by Derek Miller as the credits were rolling.  The song is so beautiful I ended up buying the album and now listen to it daily for inspiration.  Other songs performed by the Bear Springs singers, Dennis Banks, the REd Road singers, Stevie Salas, Ken Chastain and other native performers.This is a great movie to sit and watch as a group or family and then to discuss the history depicted in this film.",4,Solid Native History,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,3450,"['movie', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'concerning', 'forced', 'assimilation', 'Native', 'American', 'children', 'Christian', 'education', 'culture', 'well-done', 'film', 'produced', 'Fond', 'du', 'Lac', 'reservation', 'northern', 'Minnesota', 'Written', 'acted', 'Gloriana', 'Lightning', 'Rain', 'teacher-fiance', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'found', 'first', 'redeeming', 'value', 'fact', 'Indians', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'stereotypical', 'drunkards', 'villains', 'ignorami', 'movie', 'more', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'Indian', 'children', 'now', 'experienced', 'hands', 'white', 'Christian', 'educators.The', 'big', 'theme', 'here', 'clash', 'two', 'cultures', 'white', 'culture', 'Native', 'culture', 'Catholic', 'church', 'reservation', 'been', 'brutal', 'church', 'history', 'abusing', 'children', 'forcing', 'learn', 'white', 'culture', 'penalizing', 'children', 'spoke', 'practiced', 'culture', 'who', 'died', 'torture', 'were', 'quietly', 'buried', 'nearby', 'woods.Adam', 'Beach', 'John', 'Goodfeather', 'tribal', 'cop', 'who', 'law', 'enforcement', 'reservation', 'who', 'Luke', 'Patterson', 'white', 'geologist', 'coming', 'reservation', 'check', 'out', 'weak', 'unusual', 'earthquake', 'east', 'side', 'rez', 'Goodfeather', 'also', 'fiancee', 'Rae', 'Gloria', 'Lightning', 'who', 'also', 'having', 'similar', 'visions', 'abused', 'children', 'much', 'own', 'mother', 'had', 'own', 'mother', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'schizophrenia', 'heavily', 'medicated', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'own', 'mother', 'care', 'concern', 'mother', 'emotionally', 'bonded', 'reservation', 'mother.Things', 'start', 'getting', 'intense', 'when', 'officer', 'Land', 'Trust', 'Mark', 'Anderson', 'evil', 'white', 'guy', 'found', 'hanging', 'dead', 'tree', 'crucifiction', 'style', 'not', 'clear', 'who', 'murdered', 'murder', 'evidence', 'are', 'ghosts', 'woods', 'old', 'school', 'grounds', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'own', 'children', 'are', 'fighting', 'back', 'planned', 'proposal', 'turn', 'abandoned', 'school', 'ground', 'high-profit', 'resort', 'area', 'proposal', 'big', 'campaign', 'issue', 'upcoming', 'election.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stereotypical', 'American', 'Indian', 'movie', 'evil', 'white', 'guy', 'versus', 'innocent', 'Indian', 'more', 'admission', 'prior', 'abuses', 'white', 'culture', 'native', 'spirituality', 'how', 'native', 'culture', 'slowly', 'taking', 'back', 'rights', 'own', 'land', 'Perhaps', 'abuses', 'may', 'seem', 'farfetched', 'however', 'remember', 'compilation', 'many', 'stories', 'many', 'tribes', 'who', 'experienced', 'Kill', 'Indian', 'spare', 'man', 'mentality', 'was', 'so', 'prevalent', '1880s', '1920s', 'abuses', 'depicted', 'here', 'are', 'everything', 'rape', 'mental', 'torture', 'are', 'not', 'unique', 'Catholic', 'church', 'white', 'churches', 'were', 'taking', 'over', 'education', 'native', 'Indian', 'children.The', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'solid', 'accompanying', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'liked', 'song', 'Someone', 'call', 'Angel', 'Down', 'performed', 'Derek', 'Miller', 'credits', 'were', 'rolling', 'song', 'so', 'beautiful', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'album', 'now', 'daily', 'inspiration', 'Other', 'songs', 'performed', 'Bear', 'Springs', 'singers', 'Dennis', 'Banks', 'REd', 'Road', 'singers', 'Stevie', 'Salas', 'Ken', 'Chastain', 'other', 'native', 'performers.This', 'great', 'movie', 'sit', 'watch', 'group', 'family', 'then', 'discuss', 'history', 'depicted', 'film']",N/A

Although the writer(s) intention is to bring to light the historically horrific and abusive environment boarding schools meted out to ""save the man and kill the Indian"", I found myself less interested and sympathetic to the characters that were weaved in and out of mystical and supernatural experiences.  There seemed not enough character building invested in drawing feeling from these actors and yet the viewer is given mere glimpses into knowing or relating to each victim.  Adam Beach seems clueless and toothless as a police officer, but gets an attitude after it is too late and his fianc&eacute; is locked away; the priest seems to have more power on this reservation than anybody hanging around the ER eavesdropping and administering paperwork for a co-conspirator in Tantoo Cardinal, whom seems gullible and weak compared to most native women portrayals on her resume.During the scene before ""Rain"" is taken away and is in the hospital, the native male nurse asks the fianc&eacute; (Beach) to leave, because ""she needs rests""? Indian people (families) do not ""leave"" hospitals within the first crucial hours out of caution or make sure answers to questions are available or await test results. I take into consideration that this is Lightning's film debut and there is something to be said about the need for shooting this films subject matter, but what would have been more interesting, perhaps in black and white, is to view more scenes or diaries of the incidents of abuse and destruction against a child or children without the need for a bar scene, a white clueless geologists or some pretty native females, that is another film. The boarding schools system and its destructive history; genocide and the bureaucratic incompetence are all tied together in working against natives and should be known, but this film has elements of romance, mysticism, racism and history squeezed into a small amount of time to gain any effect on the misinformed viewer(s). Even the small amount of boarding school footage from ""The Education of Little Tree"" (1997) made me feel for the title character and his harsh experiences were real or the brief scenes from ""When The Legends Die"" (1972) were realistic.The only character that I saw as solid or close to being believable, was Dennis Banks and he has less screen time or notoriety than anyone else in the film.",2,Fairly Disappointing,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,2488,"['opening', 'scene', 'see', 'sun', 'dance', 'ceremony', 'there', 'viewer', 'taken', 'series', 'three', 'different', 'films', 'writer', 'intention', 'bring', 'light', 'historically', 'horrific', 'abusive', 'environment', 'boarding', 'schools', 'meted', 'out', 'save', 'man', 'kill', 'Indian', 'found', 'less', 'interested', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'were', 'weaved', 'mystical', 'supernatural', 'experiences', 'seemed', 'not', 'enough', 'character', 'building', 'invested', 'drawing', 'feeling', 'actors', 'yet', 'viewer', 'given', 'mere', 'glimpses', 'knowing', 'relating', 'victim', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'clueless', 'toothless', 'police', 'officer', 'attitude', 'too', 'late', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'locked', 'away', 'priest', 'have', 'more', 'power', 'reservation', 'anybody', 'hanging', 'ER', 'eavesdropping', 'administering', 'paperwork', 'co-conspirator', 'Tantoo', 'Cardinal', 'whom', 'gullible', 'weak', 'compared', 'most', 'native', 'women', 'portrayals', 'resume.During', 'scene', 'Rain', 'taken', 'away', 'hospital', 'native', 'male', 'nurse', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Beach', 'leave', 'rests', 'Indian', 'people', 'families', 'do', 'not', 'leave', 'hospitals', 'first', 'crucial', 'hours', 'caution', 'make', 'sure', 'answers', 'questions', 'are', 'available', 'await', 'test', 'results', 'take', 'consideration', 'Lightning', 'film', 'debut', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'need', 'shooting', 'films', 'subject', 'matter', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'black', 'white', 'view', 'more', 'scenes', 'diaries', 'incidents', 'abuse', 'destruction', 'child', 'children', 'need', 'bar', 'scene', 'white', 'clueless', 'geologists', 'pretty', 'native', 'females', 'film', 'boarding', 'schools', 'system', 'destructive', 'history', 'genocide', 'bureaucratic', 'incompetence', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'working', 'natives', 'should', 'be', 'known', 'film', 'elements', 'romance', 'mysticism', 'racism', 'history', 'squeezed', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'gain', 'effect', 'misinformed', 'viewer', 's', 'Even', 'small', 'amount', 'boarding', 'school', 'footage', 'Education', 'Little', 'Tree', '1997', 'made', 'feel', 'title', 'character', 'harsh', 'experiences', 'were', 'real', 'brief', 'scenes', 'When', 'Legends', 'Die', '1972', 'were', 'realistic.The', 'only', 'character', 'saw', 'solid', 'close', 'being', 'believable', 'was', 'Dennis', 'Banks', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'notoriety', 'anyone', 'else', 'film']",N/A

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[13, 18]","[BEWARE: THIS IS A KICK-THEN-PRAISE, KICK-THEN-PRAISE REVIEW AND YOU MAY DO BETTER READING A REVIEW OF THIS FILM ON A BATHROOM WALL.] - OLDER THAN AMERICA (2008) is one of those bizarre, cut-rate films that strives for a message. It eludes really positive criticism on almost all levels.To be honest, this film tells the entire story of the abuse of Native American children in Canada and the U.S. - the brutalization occurring in the boarding schools which I have always called ""the Indian Holocaust"". Children were torn from their homes, their parents and their tribes. They were shoved into these horrific boarding schools where they were reduced to trembling shadows.This terror did not officially end until 1975 - and I know a few boarding school survivors and some media who told their stories as early as the late 1960s. AIM (the great American Indian Movement) has also worked to tell about the Indian Holocaust. AIM helped with this film, which tries to tell one of those thousands of stories.That's why this film perplexes me. At first, I thought it was a documentary. In a way it was, and a deeply poetic, affecting one. So, as I watched it unfold, I wondered why anyone like Adam Beach (who produced and stars in it) would reduce it to the level of an unbelievable horror film. Not just the horror of what really happened - they take it the extra mile and make it like THE RING, GOTHIKA and other idiocies.Beach plays Johnny Goodfeather, an Indian police officer from an unidentified Ojibwa reservation in Minnesota. His girlfriend of ten years begins to flip out after seeing some visions of Indian children being tortured by nuns and priests in a boarding school. She's worried because her Aunt Apple (Tantoo Cardinal) is carrying on with a creepy priest, Father Dimitri Bartoli (Stephen Yoakam).It seems the girl's mother Irene (Rose Berens), Apple's sister, was about to report on the gruesome goings-on at the school when Fr. Bartoli intervened, had her diagnosed as a schizophrenic and electroshocked into silence. You see, they had killed several young adult Indians already. No need to let that slip, or have the bodies found. As if anyone cared in those days!The horrific Fr. Bartoli has his eye on the girl and wants to see her go the way of her mother. Into this silly mix is thrown some creepy ghost action, some terrifying moments (very well done) and a few characters I still don't get, such as seismologist Luke (Bradley Cooper, a Ralph Fiennes lookalike). He's there to investigate a recent earthquake, similar to one that rocked the boarding school decades earlier. Message? - if you mess with the Natives the earthquakes will begin?Appearances by the great fit-him-anywhere Wes Studi and Dennis Banks (as Johnny's father Pete) give this film some welcome yet unnecessary cachet. The storyline is rather cockamamie, with unbelievable events that beggar the imagination and strain credibility. The subject deserved a much better approach. This is a real, horrific chapter of America's History of Shame.Adam Beach, who should really know better than to try to keep acting, amazed me the most. How he could get behind this rather lackadaisical production with so much help behind him ... well, go figure! Georgina Lightning, who ironically has but few directing or writing feathers in her cap, wrote and directed this sour mishmash.With so many different Tribal Councils, AIM, and the State of Minnesota behind them on this, it is unworthy in the end. The Indians tell a riveting tale here, but the unneeded ghosts and horror gimmicks nearly drown out their voices. Again. It's bad enough when the usual American Boogeyman does it, but when Indians begin tripping over their own messages ....I leave it to you to decide whether to get this strange, compelling and confusing film. It has a story to tell and tells it powerfully, but then you can do a thousand times better if you read a history book on this subject.Hopefully, you won't have to run into every bathroom you encounter to read the walls and make up your mind. In actuality, though this is a horror film centering around that one school, it addresses the movement to push Indians from the reservations into the cities. It was done by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, what I call a ""genocide-by-absorption"" program: get the Indians into the cities to live and work, give them 'the American dream', and presto!!--no more Indian culture.You could also choose to call this a ""cultural bait-n-switch"" program. This horrific, shameful chapter of our history occurred between 1952-1973. The movement of certain kids to special schools, though a big part of the urbanization program, was something that had been occurring since the end of the 19th century. A lot of the Indian kids who had attended those schools participated in urbanization. It was a great number of that same generation that decided to return to their reservations instead.To think this went on for 21 years before the government finally felt it would not work for them. For a good documentary about this urbanization program, see the documentary URBAN REZ (2012, 58 minutes, hosted by Moses Brings Plenty (Lakota), unavailable on Amazon).",3,The way to defeat a people

1375955,A2IQUPNFOC79FT,B003Y7F1OG,Vegan Marcos,"[7, 9]","This is a very important film that should be shown in classrooms and homes across the land!The movie starts off with Bradley Coopers character(Luke) coming to Minnesota to research Earthquake disturbances a a result of a recent one being noticed on the Richter scales. Luke meets Billy, played by Adam Beach, who is a prominent, Native American actor on the scene today. Billy, who is the local tribal police, takes Luke to the BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs) to get a license for Luke to do research near an old school house. While getting a license from BIA, Billy notices the rather abrupt behaviour shown by the officer who eventually issues the license.Without giving away the whole story I will tell you that this is a most important film to see. It explores the whitewashing that happened for a good part of the last two centuries with the white man forcing his ways on Native Americans. We've seen this in many other cultures as well. The Canadian Indians have suffered the same fast as have the Samoans, Maori's and many other tribes throughout the world.Anyway, back to the film. Billy's girlfriend, Rain, played by Georgina Lightning, who also co-wrote and directed the film, starts having flashback visions of her Mother's childhood. Throughout the film we see a ghost, who is a silent narrator, who takes us on this tragic journey that we see through Rain's eyes.In the end, we learn that more Native American people died during this genocide that any other atrocities in history. Luke asks Billy's father, at one point in the story, why this isn't taught in the schools. The reply is that ""some stories are too horrible for the history books to tell.""This is a very important story that shows the horrible measures that were employed to assimilate the Native Americans into the white mans culture. We see at least two instances of electric-shock therapy, complements of the local Priest.Please rent this movie and watch it today or, better still, buy it.

Though a man was difficult to hold back the tears and deep sorry felt before, during, and after I watched this compelling movie. (Always felt a brother to the Native Americans.)

Then the tears of joy and happiness when everyone comes together especially the sisters; mainly the one who was brainwashed but came to her senses. What a movie!!!

History should never be picked over... teaching only what the majority wants and pertinent facts left out on purpose; real history is inclusive not exclusive to a particular group.
