It took me one day of teaching, and I discovered how vulnerable these young women are. (My race didnt matter either), they just feel so indebted (guilt for something?) to us and our passion for teaching them. For me its a natural thing to do, for them it is a gift to them. Definitely a such thing as a mid-life trauma or crisis. I would have wanted this girl in the movie too, because a real crisis like this often breaks outside of the social contructs; hence the trauma or crisis. Americans truely have been spoiled by their myopic view of what men want and what is beauty, and that it matters in this particular situation. I must admit that I was struggling with some of my own inadequacies also, which are heightened at this age. Funny how even achieving ones' dreams cannot fully engage total personhood. We must be careful not to get sideswiped by what we think ""success"" is. Achieving ones goal is not the time to see that as ""success"" (its the journey not the destination-remember that saying?)and then let your guard down. Suggestion: Have human effort but not without humility through a spiritual connection that you see as greater than yourself! It has to become a practice-not a magic trick, but it helps me balance things. PS. Men often avoid the ""attractive"" ones because they hide their insecurities, but a young girl who needs someone to think she is attractive... an older male tells her she is... well, it happens.... a lot.",4,Been there...,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,1594,"['What', 'middle', 'aged', 'professors', 'anyway', '[', '8-D', ']', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'kind', 'thoughts', 'reactions', 'professor', 'remained', 'fantasies', 'took', 'one', 'day', 'teaching', 'discovered', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'race', 'didnt', 'matter', 'just', 'feel', 'so', 'indebted', 'guilt', 'something', 'passion', 'teaching', 'natural', 'thing', 'do', 'gift', 'Definitely', 'such', 'thing', 'mid-life', 'trauma', 'crisis', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'girl', 'movie', 'too', 'real', 'crisis', 'often', 'social', 'contructs', 'hence', 'trauma', 'crisis', 'Americans', 'truely', 'have', 'been', 'spoiled', 'myopic', 'view', 'what', 'men', 'want', 'what', 'beauty', 'particular', 'situation', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'struggling', 'own', 'inadequacies', 'also', 'are', 'heightened', 'age', 'Funny', 'how', 'even', 'achieving', 'ones', 'dreams', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'engage', 'total', 'personhood', 'must', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'get', 'sideswiped', 'what', 'think', 'success', 'Achieving', 'ones', 'goal', 'not', 'time', 'see', 'success', 'journey', 'not', 'destination-remember', 'saying', 'then', 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'Suggestion', 'Have', 'human', 'effort', 'not', 'humility', 'spiritual', 'connection', 'see', 'greater', 'become', 'practice-not', 'magic', 'trick', 'balance', 'things', 'PS', 'Men', 'often', 'attractive', 'ones', 'hide', 'insecurities', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'someone', 'think', 'attractive', 'older', 'male', 'well', 'lot']",N/A
562515,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0000507QH,Alex Udvary,"[8, 9]","Cedric Kahn's ""L'Ennui"" is the story of a middle-aged man, Martin (Charles Berling) who has just gotten divorced and starts having an affair with a women half his age, Cecilla (Sophie Guillemin). At first the relationship is purely a sexual one. He doesn't care for her and we suspect she doesn't care for him. But soon Martin realizes he may love her but she is a girl to love loved. He thinks she is cheating on him. And thus his world begins to crumble as he tries to catch her in the act.Other movies have dealt with similar ideas. Right now I'm thinking of ""An Affair of Love"", which was about two people who answer an ad in the paper about meeting for a casual affair once a week. Soon the two fall in love but never confront their emotions. The other movie is ""Intimacy"". A story about two people who meet every Wednesday for their affair. But soon the man realizes he loves her but finds out she is married and tries to win her over. Both films worked. ""L'Ennui"" on the other hand doesn't.Martin is a philosophy teacher and boy does he talk a lot! I've haven't becomed this annoying watching a character in a while. The entire film consist of him questioning Cecilla. But I'm jumping ahead, let me explain. Cecilla was seeing a much older man, a painter, who was drawing nude pictures of her. He died while making love to her and when Martin finds out about this he is intrigued by her relationship with the man, hence all the questions. If only Martin would shut-up once in a while and actually listen to people maybe he wouldn't be in the state of mind he is. Even has he is making love he never stops questioning her. And don't think Cecilla is a treat either. Who is she? What does she want? Does she love Martin? Can she love anyone? Who knows, and more importantly, who cares? We don't like either of these people. I don't see how they can even stand each other out. If I sat in room with Martin I don't think I'd last 30 seconds with this guy.What ""L'Ennui"" needed to do was drop some of Martin's dialogue give him more actions and tells us something about Cecilla. By the end of the picture we have a good sense of Martin, he's a pest and a loser. Cecilla though just seems heartless. But is she really?The movie was directed by Cedric Kahn who also directed the recent ""Red Light"", a much better film. Kahn is interested in human relations. He likes to put his characters in intense situations and just watch them explode. That sounds fine but you have to give us something to care about. I never cared for these people. I never understood them.Some people may watch the film because they find it erotic. One can't really comment on that because different people find different things erotic. I didn't think it was. But who knows.Bottom-line: Do you feel like watching two annoying people for two hours?

Sophie Guillemin is quite a revelation - in every sense - without ever appearing to do much or indeed anything. Here she reminded me a lot of Isabelle Huppert in The Lacemaker (only with much more nudity), with much of Huppert's brand of everyday sexuality.Guillemin's a blank slate of a schoolgirl/model that men in crisis project their fantasies on to. She gives them her body but nothing else, and seems constantly detached and immune to surprise or emotional or intellectual involvement, much to the distress of her latest part-time conquest, recently divorced teacher/author Charles Berling. The downward spiral of obsession that will destroy his life is a given, and that's the problem. The film constantly tries to raise the stakes to surprise us by how much further it will go, but by the last third he's become so intensely irritating in yet another variation of the previous scene - only louder and more desperate - that you lose interest.

Unfortunately, she has daddy issues that push her in the direction of liaisons with older men, first a painter who is obessessed with her massive body and placid, pliant personality and then Martin, a middle-aged philosophy professor (separated from the still-gorgeous Arielle Dombasle) who seems not to have read Kant or taken him to heart (""never treat anyone merely as a means"") -- there is a classroom scene during which Kant is mentioned, but not in relation to the categorical imperative.While the painter at least saw Cecilia as something of a muse, a source of inspiration for his art (okay, bad erotic art, but still ...), Martin is just into her to, well, be into her as often and as violently as possible.  The sex scenes, and there are plenty of them, are disgustingly mechanical and essentially a form of rape.  Luckily, as the film ends, Cecilia shows signs of emerging maturity, to realize that Martin is bad news for her in the long term, and manages to figure out a way to dump the maniacal, out of control jerk -- one hopes for a better life with an actor friend closer to her age who seems to have the right idea about treating women with the respect, tenderness, and love they deserve.I gave four stars because the leads are all excellent and so is the direction.  I thought the ending was off -- there is a car crash that Martin survives, even though he says in a voice over at the beginning of the film that he would die that way.  Many viewers will probably agree with me that letting someone like that loose on the streets is a disservice to society because he'll only go out and look for another Cecilia to abuse after he gets out of the hospital.

562520,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0000507QH,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[22, 25]","I become irritated part way through this film. It's like you are forced to watch Berling's character become increasingly obsessed with Guillemin's, to the point where we are not only disturbed, but also completely perturbed by his inability to let go of Cecilia, who seems so wonderfully and completely uninterested and distant. I admit that while I watched the movie, I had to turn it off part way through; I, myself, became so anxious by and annoyed with Martin's obsessive ness. At first, I thought it was because the movie was totally unappealing, even unwatchable. However, once I watched the rest of the film I understood why. Let me explain why.Berling's growing sexual obsession with Sophie Guilleman is believable because in real life I would imagine that more men, middle aged or otherwise, develop obsessions with ordinary girls/women than with the Pamela Anderson/Jordan in-your-face sex objects. This is not to say that Guilleman is chopped liver but she is an Average girl; average looks, average figure, average sexuality and again it is, I suspect, much easier to develop a sexual obsession about a girl who is much more likely to be available to the Average man, which is what Berling is both on and off screen. The idea of a young girl believed to have killed a man three times her age via sex clearly invests her with a certain cachet not least in the eyes of a philosophy teacher drifting aimlessly yet inexorably towards mid-life crisis and not even searching for a paddle. The concept of a young girl who actually enjoys sex for its own sake and is unwilling and/or incapable of adding love to the mix, a creature in effect prepared and eager to experience sexual fulfillment as often and with as many different partners as possible and remain loyal to none is not exactly new and each time this story is told the only possible interest lies in the man who is unable to share her and how long it takes to reach its inevitable tragic conclusion.I realized that Kahn probably had every attention of making his subject so intense, so masochistic, and so repetitively annoying in his obsession, the utter irritation and anxiety that the movie provoked in me suggested that not only is the filmmaker very successful in representing pathological behavior, but also in implicating his audience in that representation.",3,An increasingly restless film,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,2332,"['become', 'irritated', 'part', 'way', 'film', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'Berling', 'character', 'become', 'increasingly', 'obsessed', 'Guillemin', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'disturbed', 'also', 'completely', 'perturbed', 'inability', 'let', 'go', 'Cecilia', 'who', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'completely', 'uninterested', 'distant', 'admit', 'watched', 'movie', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'part', 'way', 'became', 'so', 'anxious', 'annoyed', 'Martin', 'obsessive', 'ness', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'totally', 'unappealing', 'even', 'unwatchable', 'However', 'once', 'watched', 'rest', 'film', 'understood', 'why', 'Let', 'explain', 'why.Berling', 'growing', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'Sophie', 'Guilleman', 'believable', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'imagine', 'more', 'men', 'middle', 'aged', 'otherwise', 'develop', 'obsessions', 'ordinary', 'girls/women', 'Pamela', 'Anderson/Jordan', 'in-your-face', 'sex', 'objects', 'not', 'say', 'Guilleman', 'chopped', 'liver', 'Average', 'girl', 'average', 'looks', 'average', 'figure', 'average', 'sexuality', 'again', 'suspect', 'much', 'easier', 'develop', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'girl', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'available', 'Average', 'man', 'what', 'Berling', 'screen', 'idea', 'young', 'girl', 'believed', 'have', 'killed', 'man', 'three', 'times', 'age', 'sex', 'clearly', 'certain', 'cachet', 'not', 'least', 'eyes', 'philosophy', 'teacher', 'drifting', 'aimlessly', 'yet', 'inexorably', 'towards', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'not', 'even', 'searching', 'paddle', 'concept', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'actually', 'sex', 'own', 'sake', 'unwilling', 'and/or', 'incapable', 'adding', 'love', 'mix', 'creature', 'effect', 'prepared', 'eager', 'experience', 'sexual', 'fulfillment', 'often', 'as', 'many', 'different', 'partners', 'possible', 'remain', 'loyal', 'none', 'not', 'exactly', 'new', 'time', 'story', 'told', 'only', 'possible', 'interest', 'man', 'who', 'unable', 'share', 'how', 'long', 'reach', 'inevitable', 'tragic', 'conclusion.I', 'realized', 'Kahn', 'probably', 'had', 'attention', 'making', 'subject', 'so', 'intense', 'so', 'masochistic', 'so', 'repetitively', 'annoying', 'obsession', 'utter', 'irritation', 'anxiety', 'movie', 'provoked', 'suggested', 'not', 'only', 'filmmaker', 'very', 'successful', 'representing', 'pathological', 'behavior', 'also', 'implicating', 'audience', 'representation']",N/A
562521,A1HXR6PIRTO0UO,B0000507QH,J_J_Gittes,"[0, 0]","After having seen this film my belief that french cinema of the last ten years is a s alive as ever has again been reassured. Many claims have been made, that french films aren`t what they used to be(which they of course aren`t, as time changes), even that the quality of french film production has fallen into mediocrity. But as Jonathan Rosenbaum pointed out already during the 90s in his essay on ""Les Voleurs"" (1996 / Andre Techine), a film I thoroughly recommend, is that most critics only consider what they get to see from french films, whixh is very little. If they were really interested and would dig a bit deeper into every years production on their own, they would find many rough diamonds along with some polished ones.Cedric Kahn is a young director and according to this film a most promising one. We have the Story of a middle-aged philosophy teacher who falls for a 17 year old girl (sorry Trevor ), but this isn`t your usual older man falls for Lolita type of film. In fact I got so bored after about 15 minutes, because of the lurid but seemingly empty pace of the movie and the contrived dialogue, that I started switching channels on my TV, but when i returned to the same scene I had left a few seconds later, i knew I was finally onto something.The film begins with a rapid pace showing a disturbed Charles Berling (who had one year earlier starred in Anne Fontaine's brilliant social study ""Nettoyage a sec"", but may be best known for the leading role in Patrice Leconte? ""Ridicule"") who has entered a cocktail party of his ex-wife Sophie, with the intention to speak to her (they seem to be separated for a short time only), but doesn't succeed as she seems to be more concerned with making the impression that she has her life under control, though we see that she's very far away from this goal. It is never explicitely mentioned in the film, but there are numerous great scenes that indicate that the marriage has left deep wounds in Sophie's heart and mind, and probably also in Berling's character, though he isn`t one for analizing situations, when it comes to himself. At the party he is ""offered"" a young student who admires him for the night, but she shows not a hint of interest. He even explains to Sophie, that he hasn't had sex for the last six months, and intends to go on this way, in order to write a new book. After having left, he wonders aimlessly through the night when he encounters a painter who gives him his adress after a rescue by Berling from a difficult situation. When he visits the painters house the next day, he discovers that he has died during sexual intercourse with his 17 year old student he was obsessed with. After meeting her, Berling steps in the same ""trap"". he starts a sexual relationship with her, that gets more and more dramatic until end of the film, and the final climax.The theme of the film is obssession, and it reminded me at times of Zulawski's movie of the same name, though it isn`t as notorious or deliric. A case study of the protagonists neuroses getting the best of him, and his entanglement into an illusion of his own making. The fascinating object of desire is Cecilia (debut by Sophie Guillemin), who in no way corresponds with a young femme fatale. Quite on the contrary. She is a bit fat, small, is aware of her sexuality but doesn`t use it as a tool, she is rather introverted and makes no real attempt at seducing anybody. More than anything else she is like an object waiting to be used, though only if it pleases her (which it seems to do quite often though). And that becomes the crucial point. No active relationship develops between the two besides a sexual one, which is neither demanding nor boring. Just plain ordinary sex, which is shown several times, and is over fast. Cecilia seems to be oblivious to ambition, the need to small-talk with people, or communicate on any other level than sexually. She seems to have no real needs nor desires, living in the moment, and with a day to day time-table, that`s pretty schematic. The protagonist now starts to interpret this blank canvas, and instead of writing his book, he begins to wonder what`s going on in Cecilia`s mind, begins projecting his own fears on her. He thinks she is cheating, she`s lying, she doesn`t love him, etc. as he becomes more and more possessive. As his desparate attempts to possess her even sexually don`t find a satisfiying conclusion his paranoia takes on a clinical state. More and more he turns into a victim to his desire for love and closeness, which he can`t possibly find in Cecilia, but instead of letting it go, he degrades himself even more.The strength of the film lies in its director`s ability to carry things to the extreme, to let its protagonist go not just to the borders, but clearly over everything socially acceptible. He shows the utter ridiculousness of the protagonists behaviour, without ridiculing him, and even in the most degrading and unbelievable scenes the direction never falters on what is a very small line between seriousness and absurdity, maintaining the films credibility, and most of all its sincerity, through which every character of the film is primarily his own, keeping its dignity. This exceptional accomplishment by C&eacute;dric Kahn is most promising for a young director more interested in the process of self-discovery and redemption of his characters, than in any bleak nihilism or apocalyptic vision of mankind and relationships.. The ending beautifully underscores his humanist standpoint.Strongly recommended.",5,"""Boredom""",1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,5539,"['having', 'seen', 'film', 'belief', 'french', 'cinema', 'last',

As a total film, however, it stutters more than a few times. Technically, the subtitles occasionally flash too fast or are offered with no contrast so they become almost unreadable. The camerawork is quite good, however, with a definite European style. The story itself is also intriguing, but once the point is made,it has nowhere to go. The problems begin with the actors and plot. Not that the actors were bad; they were actually very good. But you understand from minute one that Martin isn't wrapped too tightly (his treatment of a fan, for example, early on), so his bizarre behavior once he meets Cecelia isn't surprising in the least. More simply, the guy evinces no sympathy in the least from the viewer; none. He's a complete ass. He comes off as needy, selfish and egomaniacial, one of those boors who are so deeply personally insecure they become outwardly obnoxious and nasty to hide it from everyone. You really don't care what ultimately happens to him, and also understand that if he did get what he wanted in the film, he would immediately reject it once he did, just to be hurtful. Cecilia, the more you get to know her, is just as bad in another way. She doesn't come off as stupid (as someone else said)or obtuse, but as almost totally uncaring and unfeeling, not to mention far more immature than her few years. She simply does whatever she wants whenever she can without a lot of regard of how it can hurt or affect people. She understands how they can feel things, but unless it touches her directly and negatively, doesn't really care. Look at how she regarded her father. All in all, it's hard to feel sympathy for her as well. She's not opaque but almost completely transparent. And to say the film's point was hammered home way too long or that the ending was ridiculously abrupt is putting it mildly.",2,"Better than many, but doesn't match the hype",1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,1933,"['most', 'fundamental', 'level', 'i.e.', 'sexual/semi-erotic', 'level', ""L'Ennui"", 'most', 'definitely', 'moments', 'total', 'film', 'however', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'Technically', 'subtitles', 'occasionally', 'flash', 'too', 'fast', 'are', 'offered', 'contrast', 'so', 'become', 'almost', 'unreadable', 'camerawork', 'quite', 'good', 'however', 'definite', 'European', 'style', 'story', 'also', 'intriguing', 'once', 'point', 'made', 'nowhere', 'go', 'problems', 'begin', 'actors', 'plot', 'Not', 'actors', 'were', 'bad', 'were', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'understand', 'minute', 'one', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'wrapped', 'too', 'tightly', 'treatment', 'fan', 'example', 'early', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'once', 'Cecelia', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'least', 'More', 'simply', 'guy', 'sympathy', 'least', 'viewer', 'none', 'complete', 'ass', 'off', 'needy', 'selfish', 'egomaniacial', 'one', 'boors', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'deeply', 'personally', 'insecure', 'become', 'outwardly', 'obnoxious', 'nasty', 'hide', 'everyone', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'ultimately', 'also', 'understand', 'did', 'get', 'what', 'wanted', 'film', 'would', 'immediately', 'reject', 'once', 'did', 'just', 'be', 'hurtful', 'Cecilia', 'more', 'get', 'know', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'way', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'stupid', 'someone', 'else', 'said', 'obtuse', 'almost', 'totally', 'uncaring', 'unfeeling', 'not', 'mention', 'far', 'more', 'immature', 'few', 'years', 'simply', 'whatever', 'can', 'lot', 'regard', 'how', 'can', 'hurt', 'affect', 'people', 'how', 'can', 'feel', 'things', 'directly', 'negatively', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Look', 'how', 'regarded', 'father', 'hard', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'opaque', 'almost', 'completely', 'transparent', 'say', 'film', 'point', 'was', 'hammered', 'home', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'ending', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'abrupt', 'putting', 'mildly']",N/A
