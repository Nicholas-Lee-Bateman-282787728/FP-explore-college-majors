Erland,"[6, 8]","The British '04 film `The Truth About Love' stars America's sweetheart Jennifer Love Hewitt masquerading as a Brit in this somewhat jaded drama of love, betrayal and rediscovery is, shall I say it, a bust. To be fair, it isn't Jennifer fault, I thought she did quite well overall, she looks great as always and demonstrated the ability and range to do more than just light comedy. I hope she'll get the opportunity to act in more serious roles in a good production in the near future.I'm not exactly sure where to place the blame for this dismal failure, all I can say for sure is that nothing seems to work in this film. The usually likeable Jimi Mistry is totally out of character and a non-factor in the movie while Dougray Scott fairs a little better but not well enough to spark any real interest in the viewing audience. I guess you'll watch this one if you're a die-hard Jennifer Love Hewitt fan, there's no other reason to see it.",2,"""Take Me And Raddish Me""",1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,938,"['British', ""'04"", 'film', 'Truth', 'Love', 'stars', 'America', 'sweetheart', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'masquerading', 'Brit', 'somewhat', 'jaded', 'drama', 'love', 'betrayal', 'rediscovery', 'shall', 'say', 'bust', 'be', 'fair', ""n't"", 'Jennifer', 'fault', 'thought', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'overall', 'great', 'always', 'demonstrated', 'ability', 'range', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'light', 'comedy', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'get', 'opportunity', 'act', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'good', 'production', 'near', 'future.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'where', 'place', 'blame', 'dismal', 'failure', 'can', 'say', 'sure', 'nothing', 'work', 'film', 'usually', 'likeable', 'Jimi', 'Mistry', 'totally', 'character', 'non-factor', 'movie', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'little', 'better', 'not', 'well', 'enough', 'spark', 'real', 'interest', 'viewing', 'audience', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'one', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'fan', 'other', 'reason', 'see']",N/A

I've always found her immature and stilted, with a severely limited range. But this Direct-to-DVD finds her appropiating the facial complexity of a real woman instead of a perpetually pouty twenty-two year old. And I confess I've never found her sexy (again, because she seems child-like), but at thirty-three she finally acts her age and looks effortlessly sexy. With her sky-high forehead, the curly Louise Brooks bangs-bob she sports covers it, making her look older and more sophisticated; if she only had the guts to cut her hair that way off screen. Perhaps she drops her usual shtick because she's a bit off-kilter being the only Yank in a British film and stuggling with an unfamiliar accent. And about that ""accent"": it's very clearly DUBBED, as is her co-star cad husband, a terrific Jimi Mistry. It's hard to  to tell whether it's her voice or not, but her original vocals obviously needed fine-tuning so the film makers ADR'd it (Automatic Dialog Replacement). To cover up the incompetence, they also ADR'd her scene partners as well. All in all, the best acting she's ever done, in a cliche-ridden plot with some someprisingly well scripted dialogue in parts. They should really just stop making films with ""The Truth About"" phrase in the titles because they are inevitably awful: The Truth About Cats and Dogs (1996), The Truth About Charlie (2002) and The Truth About Love (2005).

925858,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AC7OY8,Grady Harp,"[6, 7]","Watching TRUTH ABOUT LOVE (is this a double entendre about the star?) is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep - you put it in the DVD slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day. And it works for that for that purpose: being a British romantic comedy it is a bit more.The story is a rather simple one about a wife Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt) married to an increasingly distant husband Sam (Jimi Mistry) who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice. His partner Archie (Dougray Scott) is fond of both Sam and Alice, but has a longtime attraction to Alice that goes beyond friendship. Alice pals with her sister Felicity (Kate Miles), a free love advocate, who encourages Alice to have affairs. On Valentine's Day, after a drinking binge with her sister, Alice mails a card to Sam signed 'Anonymous' as a test to see if Sam responds, testing his fidelity. At the same time Archie mails a radish seed packet to Alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not. Both have ex post facto regrets. Sam in fact is spending time with a lover Katya (Branka Katic) and is indeed cheating on Alice. Alice arranges assignations with Sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet Sam in disguise as 'Anonymous' to test his fidelity. The entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth - and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise (of sorts) of the fluffy script.British comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting. Perhaps had director John Hay elected to cast a British actress as Alice instead of pasting a phony accent on Jennifer Love Hewitt the result may have been improved. But in the end this story by Peter Bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages. One terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive. There are some nice scenes of London and a few moments of passable humor, but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music/white noise.

Yeah, sure, she may never win an Oscar, but at least she's always fun to watch [unlike 2x Oscar winner Meryl Streep, who aside from a precious few roles, is a usually a deal killer for me...] That's the only reason it rates 3 stars; the casting saves it from a 2- or even 1-star rating.Other reviewers have raised JLH's pointless Brit accent [what, her character couldn't be an ex-pat Yank who married a Brit?] but credit where credit is due: her's is easily as good [just as bad?] as Gwyneth Paltrow's in _Sliding Doors_ w/o sounding quite as snooty. So, be prepared to be jolted by the funny noises she's making, and get on w/ watching the show.The script is bad. Not actual lines, which are within the norm for romcom dialogue, but the plot in general is just hopeless. The farcical situation that forms the plot is supposed to provide the comedy here, and just makes the viewer uncomfortable with the ongoing logical failures: one bad idea following another, even without the occasional drunken fit to provide an excuse. So, some minor rom developments w/ insufficent com is what really drags the rating down.Basically, ALL of the actors involved deserve to be congratulated for making the best of a bad situation, but the viewer is left with the feeling of ""who's the idiot who green-lighted this project, and how can I get their job?""The very real-seeming chemistry btw JLH & Dougray unfortunately got little screen time for portrayal; fire the director!Cinematography was generally quite good; give the camera crew a bonus.

I was pleasantly surprised by that movie and thought the same would happen with this one. I'm sad to say that this wasn't the case. This movie was not what I expected.The story revolves around Alice and her husband Sam. Alice receives a packet of radish seeds from an anonymous admirer. Written on the back, Alice's secret admirer declares his love for her. Since there is no name on the message, Alice assumes that her 'loving' husband has sent her the message. It turns out she was wrong. The message was in fact sent by the couple's mutual best friend Archie, who has secretly been in love with Alice since he met her.After getting wasted and accepting a dare from her sister, Alice sends her husband Sam a love letter marked anonymous. When the mail arrives, Sam opens the love letter in front of his wife and acts as if nothing important came in the mail. Alice begins to doubt her husband but instead of kicking his @$$, she convinces herself that her husband knows it's from her and that is why he doesn't mention it. To make a long story short, Alice goes through a lot of trouble to make her two-timing husband come back to her, and even after she finds out he's cheating attempts to save the marriage.This seemed unrealistic to me and even a little sad. I could understand and empathize with Alice but I just couldn't believe that such a nice woman would allow her jerk husband to walk all over her. No one deserves this type of treatment. I won't give away the ending, it's actually quite nice but I will say that The Truth About Love is not a romantic comedy, it's more of a romantic tragedy. Had this been written better I would have probably given it 5 stars. All the performances were good. I guess if I disliked Jimi Mistry then, he did his job well.Truly Loveable, if not flawed.",3,The Truth About 'The Truth About Love',1130716800,"10 31, 2005",2005,1888,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'watching', ""'If"", 'Only', ""'"", 'movie', 'starring', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'thought', 'same', 'would', 'happen', 'one', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Alice', 'husband', 'Sam', 'Alice', 'packet', 'radish', 'seeds', 'anonymous', 'admirer', 'Written', 'back', 'Alice', 'secret', 'admirer', 'love', 'name', 'message', 'Alice', ""'loving"", 'husband', 'sent', 'message', 'out', 'was', 'wrong', 'message', 'was', 'fact', 'sent', 'couple', 'mutual', 'best', 'friend', 'Archie', 'who', 'secretly', 'been', 'love', 'Alice', 'met', 'her.After', 'getting', 'wasted', 'accepting', 'dare', 'sister', 'Alice', 'husband', 'Sam', 'love', 'letter', 'marked', 'anonymous', 'When', 'mail', 'Sam', 'love', 'letter', 'front', 'wife', 'acts', 'nothing', 'important', 'came', 'mail', 'Alice', 'doubt', 'husband', 'instead', 'kicking', '@', 'husband', 'why', ""n't"", 'mention', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'Alice', 'lot', 'trouble', 'make', 'two-timing', 'husband', 'come', 'back', 'even', 'cheating', 'attempts', 'save', 'marriage.This', 'seemed', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'little', 'sad', 'could', 'understand', 'empathize', 'Alice', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'nice', 'woman', 'would', 'allow', 'jerk', 'husband', 'walk', 'one', 'type', 'treatment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'actually', 'quite', 'nice', 'will', 'say', 'Truth', 'Love', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'more', 'romantic', 'tragedy', 'Had', 'been', 'written', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'performances', 'were', 'good', 'guess', 'disliked', 'Jimi', 'Mistry', 'then', 'did', 'job', 'well.Truly', 'Loveable', 'not', 'flawed']",N/A

In actuality it is from her husband's law partner who has nursed a crush on her since University. After a couple drinks and some encouragement from her trampy sister, Alice decides to tempt husband Sam with a racy note from ""anonymous"" assuming that he knows it's her. Since he is unfaithful, it could be his mistress Katya or the sexy juror on his latest case.After a heated phone sex conversation (note that when Hewitt uses her anonymous voice, she sounds like a Russian drag queen, which is enough to turn any man flacid), Alice sets up a rendezvous with Sam hoping to add some passion and spice to their marriage. Instead, she discovers what a scoundrel she's married to.Dougray Scott has about 20 minutes of screen time as Archie, the hapless bachelor who has loved her from afar.
