941581,A3AGD72LZ0ZRBL,B000BFH2C8,"Bad movie buster ""BMB""","[0, 1]","I think this went straight to video, and it's easy to see why.  It is nothing but a rehash of kids sports movies which have been done before multiple times, and usually much better.  Does this sound familiar: fallen sports idol finds a purpose in life by coaching a team of misfits -- the fat kid, the tough kid, the shy kid,the cool kid -- who go from zeroes to heroes?  Here is the problem: the kids are such cardboard cliches that they have nothing interesting to say or do.  Perhaps the writer intended that the kids would have all the funny lines and Martin Lawrence would be the staight man, but on film the kids are not funny, and since Lawrence isn't either, all we are left with is the cliched plot.  Since the movie would entertain an 8 or 9 year old who has never seen the Bad News Bears or its progeny, I was going to give this movie 2 stars on that basis.  However, I downgraded it one star because of the absolute nerve of the studio to advertise an ""alternate ending"" on the packaging.  For those of you who have watched the movie and then watched the ""alternate"" ending, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

941587,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000BFH2C8,Dorrie Wheeler,"[11, 13]","The Martin Lawrence movie Rebound is now available on DVD. Martin stars as Coach Roy McCormick, a college basketball coach who is obviously feeling himself a little too much. Photoshoots and hanging on Cadillac Escalades are more important than coaching it appears. When Coach Roy is banned from the NCBA he is left without a college coaching position. His attorney, portrayed by Breckin Meyer, explains to the NCBA that they have to give Coach Roy another chance before they enact a lifetime ban.Wendy Raquel Robinson (The Steve Harvey Show), stars in the film as the mother of young boy who doesn't have his father in his life. Coach Roy soon finds himself back at his alma mater, Mt. Vernon Jr. High coaching a group of misfit basketball players. The kids are quirky and memorable. Rebound is a funny, family friendly film even if it is a little predictable at time. It's a rather tame film for Martin. Tom Arnold makes a cameo in the film, and Megan Mullally stars as the films principal. The film was directed by Steve Carr who directed the family friendly films Daddy Day Care and Dr. Doolittle 2. It's almost like a basketball version of The Bad News Bears. Although, the movie wasn't a huge commercial success I wouldn't be suprised if there was a sequel.I give this movie five stars because like ""Herbie Fully Loaded,"" and several other pre-teen movies released this past year, this movie is an excellent movie for ""that audience.""

941590,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000BFH2C8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Coach Roy McCormick (Martin Lawrence) is a successful but highly controversial college basketball coach, seemingly more concerned in raking in endorsement deals. When he lets his fiery temper get the better of him and he inadvertently kills a team mascot, he is banned from coaching at the college level for one year. A loophole does allow him to be reinstated if, after one year, he's proven he can properly behave himself. But when no high-profile school comes calling, Coach Roy reluctantly settles for his old middle school of Mount Vernon, who has on its Smelters roster a pretty lame group of non-players. Now, Coach Roy must do some soul-searching, get over his huge ego, do some in-school recruiting, and somehow lead his hapless team into at least not losing by triple digits.Rebound follows the well-trodden formula layed out by The Bad News Bears, The Mighty Ducks, and even the recent Kicking and Screaming, about a band of preadolescent misfits rising above their own inadequacies and being led by an initially disinclined coach. Martin Lawrence excels in this warm-hearted, feel-good family comedy. At first being all about the bling, he is taught life lessons by the children he takes under his wing and, in the course of the film, becomes a better person. See? Formula.What makes the whole thing also work is the better than good supporting cast. Of particular note is Patrick Warburton as Roy's over the top nemesis Coach Burgess of the middle school Vikings hoops team. Good choices are also made in casting Horatio Sanz as Roy's cherubic assistant coach and Megan Mullally as Principal Walsh. Last but not least, the kids are all endearing and easy to root for. Kudos go to the two girls who play the knowledgeable high school sports reporters; they greatly enliven the proceedings. So, we get family fun, traditional values, some excellent coaching techniques, and a lesson in cohesive teamwork. Not too shabby for a Martin Lawrence flick.

After some really embarrassing defeats, Coach McCormick comes to the conclusion that his reputation is at stake.  How is he ever going to get back to coaching big time college ball if he can't turn around a small-time junior varsity team?  Thus comes the turn-around.  He teaches the teams best player that in order for the team to get better, he must PASS the ball to his teammates so they can play as a team.  Besides, basketball is a team sport, right.  He does it in a way that hurts the players feelings, but afterwards, he picks him back up when the teams wins its first game by playing TEAM basketball.  After Coach McCormick helps turn the team around from a losing team into a winner, he is now faced with the decision of going back to big-time ball or staying with the once-terrible junior varsity squad.

There are some laughs but you've seen it all before...a down on his luck coach takes over a group of misfit players who no one else wants to coach and turns them into winners....Let's see, Bad News Bears, Mighty Ducks, Little Giants...yes it's the same plot with different faces and this time the sport is basketball.  Roy McCormick (martin Lawrence) is a big time college basketball coach whose tempter tantrums get him banned.  The only job he can find in coaching is returning to his old middle school to coach a team of losers who haven't won a game in years.  McCormick's agent Tim Fink (Breckin Meyer) believes it will be a good PR move for him to help get his old job back.  At first McCormick is all ego and merely shows up.  His team consists only of five players playing stereotypical roles...there's the one good player Keith, the fat kid Fuzzy, etc...  Keith's mother Jeanie tears into McCormick and right away we know that the two will become romantically involved later.  McCormick recruits two more players, the super tall but uncoordinated Wes, and the tough as nails girl nicknamed Big Mac.  Tragically, the actress who played Big Mac, Tara Correa was shot and killed in a gang related shooting in 2005.Well you know the story...McCormick finally gets the kids to play as a team and eventually leads them into the playoffs.  Now middle schools in my area don't have playoffs in basketball or state championships but who am I to tread on poetic license.  They beat their rivals who are coached by another stereotype role, the coach who yells a lot and wants to win at all costs.  Fortunately the coach is played by Patrick Warburton who brings a dash of humor to every role he plays and makes the part watchable.  Horatio Sanz of SNL co-stars as the teams original witless coach who gets girls to show up for games with free Pizza in kind of a creepy way.

941608,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BFH2C8,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Martin Lawrence stars in a comedy of the old school, about the underdogs who regain their pride and dignity to win the basketball games all the way to the championship. Though it has been used in the past countless times, the formula still works as is seen in the recent hit `Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.' Unfortunately `Rebound' has no Ben or Vince, let alone the delightful performance from Billy Bob in `Bad News Bears.' But still all the kids in the film are good, the sole reason for me to give the three stars.Martin Lawrence plays a college basketball coach Roy McCormick who really needs anger management. Because of one unwise behavior (of killing a mascot bird of the opposing team), it is decided that Roy should be kicked out of the league for good. But Roy's agent (Breckin Meyer) finds a loophole, which gives Roy a last chance. That is, to accept the job of coaching a basketball team in his junior high school Mount Vernon High. And you know, the team consists of the school's underdogs.The script has no originality, but it is not without fun, thanks to the kids who take their roles more seriously than the adult counterparts. One juvenile delinquent named `Big Mac' (Tara Correa-McMullen) is hilarious with her `So what?' attitudes and her low-key love story. Also, Alia Shawkat and Amy Bruckner make a cheerful pair of sports reporter and her assistant, both more energetic than the adult actors like Breckin Meyer, who is wasted in the underwritten script. Patrick Warburton, Haratio Sanz, and Megan Mullally, and Wendy Raquel Robinson also appear, but none of them can brighten up the film as much as the younger cast of the film.As for Martin Lawrence, though I don't think he is bad here, I couldn't understand why he should be the star of the film. His role is rather a boring one, with nothing particularly funny or touching about him. Like the same director's previous `Daddy Day Care,' this Steve Carr-directed film is most amusing when it shows the kids on the screen, not the star who must have gotten a huge paycheck.",3,"""(The) Bad News Bears"" Without Walter Matthau or Billy Bob Thornton: What You See Instead Is ...",1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,2053,"['Martin', 'Lawrence', 'stars', 'comedy', 'old', 'school', 'underdogs', 'who', 'regain', 'pride', 'dignity', 'win', 'basketball', 'games', 'way', 'championship', 'been', 'used', 'past', 'countless', 'times', 'formula', 'still', 'seen', 'recent', 'hit', 'Dodgeball', 'True', 'Underdog', 'Story', 'Unfortunately', 'Rebound', 'Ben', 'Vince', 'let', 'alone', 'delightful', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'still', 'kids', 'film', 'are', 'good', 'sole', 'reason', 'give', 'three', 'stars.Martin', 'Lawrence', 'college', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Roy', 'McCormick', 'who', 'really', 'anger', 'management', 'one', 'unwise', 'behavior', 'killing', 'mascot', 'bird', 'opposing', 'team', 'decided', 'Roy', 'should', 'be', 'kicked', 'league', 'good', 'Roy', 'agent', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'loophole', 'Roy', 'last', 'chance', 'accept', 'job', 'coaching', 'basketball', 'team', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'Mount', 'Vernon', 'High', 'know', 'team', 'school', 'underdogs.The', 'script', 'originality', 'not', 'fun', 'thanks', 'kids', 'who', 'take', 'roles', 'more', 'seriously', 'adult', 'counterparts', 'One', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'named', 'Big', 'Mac', 'Tara', 'Correa-McMullen', 'hilarious', 'So', 'what', 'attitudes', 'low-key', 'love', 'story', 'Also', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'Amy', 'Bruckner', 'make', 'cheerful', 'pair', 'sports', 'reporter', 'assistant', 'more', 'energetic', 'adult', 'actors', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'who', 'wasted', 'underwritten', 'script', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'Haratio', 'Sanz', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'Wendy', 'Raquel', 'Robinson', 'also', 'appear', 'none', 'can', 'brighten', 'up', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'younger', 'cast', 'film.As', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'star', 'film', 'role', 'rather', 'boring', 'one', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'funny', 'touching', 'same', 'director', 'previous', 'Daddy', 'Day', 'Care', 'Steve', 'Carr-directed', 'film', 'most', 'amusing', 'when', 'kids', 'screen', 'not', 'star', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'gotten', 'huge', 'paycheck']",N/A
